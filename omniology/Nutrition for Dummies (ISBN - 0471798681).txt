Dedication
This book is dedicated to my husband, Perry Luntz, a fellow writer who, as
always, stayed patient as a saint and even-tempered beyond belief while I was
racing pell-mell (and not always pleasantly) to deadline.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This new edition of Nutrition For Dummies has given me the opportunity to
work with yet another group of thoroughly pleasant professionals at the
Dummies group of Wiley Publishing. Acquisitions Editor Michael Lewis enthu-
siastically welcomed the new edition and kept the project moving smoothly.
Senior Project Editor Natalie Harris was incredibly soothing to the author, not
to mention totally in command of the hundreds, maybe even thousands, of
details it takes to update a nutrition book. I appreciate Danielle Voirol, maybe
more than she knows; medical and science writers understand very well that
without skillful, knowledgeable copy editors, we would be walking over fac-
tual cliffs every day of our writing lives. Finally, I am grateful to Alfred Bushway,
PhD, for once again reading and commenting on the manuscript. Thanks, guys.

Introduction
O
nce upon a time people simply sat down to dinner, eating to fill up an
empty stomach or just for the pleasure of it. Nobody said, “Wow, that
cream soup is loaded with calories,” or asked whether the bread was a high-
fiber loaf or fretted about the chicken being served with the skin still on. No
longer. Today, the dinner table can be a battleground between health and
pleasure. You plan your meals with the precision of a major general moving
his troops into the front lines, and for most people, the fight to eat what’s
good for you rather than what tastes good has become a lifelong struggle.
This book is designed to end the war between your need for good nutrition
and your equally compelling need for tasty meals. In fact (listen up, here!),
what’s good for you can also be good to eat — and vice versa.
About This Book
Nutrition For Dummies, 4th Edition, doesn’t aim to send you back to the class-
room, sit you down, and make you take notes about what to put on the table
every day from now until you’re 104 years old. You’re reading a reference
book, so you don’t have to memorize anything — when you want more info,
just jump in anywhere to look it up.
Instead, this book means to give you the information you need to make wise
food choices — which always means choices that please the palate and soul,
as well as the body. Some of what you’ll read here is really, really basic: 
definitions of vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and — can
you believe this? — plain old water. You’ll also read tips about how to put
together a nutritious shopping list and how to use food to make meals so
good you can’t wait to eat them.
For those who know absolutely nothing about nutrition except that it deals
with food, this book is a starting point. For those who know more than a little
about nutrition, this book is a refresher course to bring you up to speed on
what has happened since the last time you checked out a calorie chart.

For those who want to know absolutely everything, this 4th edition of Nutrition
for Dummies book is UP TO DATE, with hot new info from the 2005 revisions
of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, new recommended daily allowances
for all the nutrients a healthy body needs, plus all the twisty “this is good for
you” and “this is really, really rotten” bits and pieces of food info that nutri-
tion scientists have come up with since, well, the last edition.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps, as well as
key words in bulleted lists.
 Nutrition experts commonly use metric terms such as gram (g), mil-
ligram (mg), and microgram (mcg) to describe quantities of protein, fat,
carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Feel free to use
the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book whenever you forget what each
means.
What You Don’t Have to Read
What? Not read something printed in a book? Well, yeah. Some small parts of
this book are fun or informative but not necessarily vital to your understand-
ing of nutrition. For example:
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear here
and there. They share personal stories and observations but aren’t nec-
essary reading.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This information is
interesting but not critical to your understanding of nutrition.
 The stuff on the copyright page: No kidding. You’ll find nothing here of
interest unless you’re inexplicably enamored by legal language and
Library of Congress numbers.

Nutrition For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Foolish Assumptions
Every book is written with a particular reader in mind, and this one is no dif-
ferent. As I wrote this book, I made the following basic assumptions about
who you are and why you plunked down your hard-earned cash for an entire
volume about nutrition: 
 You didn’t study nutrition in high school or college and now you’ve dis-
covered that you have a better shot a staying healthy if you know how
to put together well-balanced, nutritious meals. 
 You’re confused by conflicting advice on vitamins and minerals, protein,
fats and carbs. In other words, you need a reliable road map through the
nutrient maze.
 You want basic information, but you don’t want to become an expert in
nutrition or spend hours digging your way through medical textbooks
and journals.
How This Book Is Organized
The following is a brief summary of each part in Nutrition For Dummies, 4th
Edition. You can use this guide as a fast way to check out what you want to
read first. One really nice thing about this book is that you don’t have to 
start with Chapter 1 and read straight through to the end. Au contraire, as 
the French like to say when they mean “on the contrary.” You can dive in
absolutely anywhere and still come up with tons of tasty information about
how food helps your body work.
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition
Chapter 1 defines nutrition and its effects on your body. This chapter also
tells you how to read a nutrition study and how to judge the value of nutri-
tion information in newspapers, magazines, and on TV. Chapter 2 is a really
clear guide to how your digestive system works to transform food and bever-
ages into the nutrients you need to sustain a healthy body. Chapter 3 concen-
trates on calories, the energy factor in food and beverages. Chapter 4 tells
you how much of each nutrient you need to stay in tiptop form. Chapter 5
details some of the rules on dietary supplements — the pills, powders, and
potions that add nutritional punch to your regular diet.

Introduction

Part II: What You Get from Food
Chapter 6 gives you the facts about protein: where you get it and what it does
in your body. Chapter 7 does the same job for dietary fat, while Chapter 8
explains carbohydrates: sugars, starches, and that indigestible but totally
vital substance in carbohydrate foods — ta-da! — dietary fiber. Chapter 9 
outlines the risks and, yes, some newly proven benefits of alcohol beverages.
Chapter 10 is about vitamins, the substances in food that trigger so many vital
chemical reactions in your body. Chapter 11 is about minerals, substances
that often work in tandem with vitamins. Chapter 12 explains phytochemicals,
newly important substances in food. Chapter 13 is about water, the essential
liquid that comprises as much as 70 percent of your body weight. This chap-
ter also describes the functions of electrolytes, special minerals that maintain
your fluid balance (the correct amount of water inside and outside your body
cells).
Part III: Healthy Eating
Chapter 14 is about hunger (the need for food) and appetite (the desire for
food). Balancing these two eating factors makes maintaining a healthful
weight possible for you. Chapter 15 on the other hand, is about food prefer-
ence: why you like some foods and really, really hate others. (Broccoli,
anyone?) Chapter 16 tells you how to assemble a healthful diet. It’s based 
on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans created by the U.S. Departments of
Agriculture and Health and Human Services, plus some recent updates from
the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine, so you know it’s
good for you. Chapter 17 explains how to use nutritional guidelines to plan
nutritious, appetizing meals at home. Chapter 18 shows you how to take the
guidelines out to dinner so that you can judge the value of foods in all kinds
of restaurants, from the posh white-tablecloth ones to fast-food havens.
Part IV: Food Processing
Chapter 19 asks and answers this simple question: What is food processing?
Chapter 20 shows you how cooking affects the way food looks and tastes, as
well as its nutritional value. Chapter 21 does the same for freezing, canning,
drying, and irradiating techniques. Chapter 22 gives you the lowdown on
chemicals used to keep food fresh.
4
Nutrition For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Part V: Food and Medicine
Chapter 23 explains why some food gives some people hives and presents
strategies for identifying and avoiding the food to which you may be allergic.
Chapter 24 is about how eating or drinking certain foods and beverages may
affect your mood — a hot topic these days with nutrition researchers.
Chapter 25 tells you how foods may interact with medical drugs — an impor-
tant subject for anyone who ever has taken, now takes, or ever plans to take
medicine. Chapter 26 tells you how some foods may actually act as preven-
tive medicine or relieve the symptoms of certain illnesses ranging from the
horrible-but-not-really-serious common cold to the Big Two: heart disease
and cancer.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Could there even be a For Dummies book without The Part of Tens? Not a
chance. This part (Chapters 27, 28, and 29) provides ten great nutritional
Web site addresses, lists ten common foods with near-magical status, and 
last — but definitely not least — lays out ten easy ways to cut calories 
from food.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are a handy For Dummies way to catch your attention as you slide your
eyes down the page. The icons come in several varieties, each with its own
special meaning:
Nutrition is full of stuff that “everybody knows.” This masked marvel clues
you in to the real facts when (as often happens) everybody’s wrong!
This little guy looks smart because he’s marking the place where you find def-
initions of the words used by nutrition experts.
The Official Word icon says, “Look here for scientific studies, statistics, defini-
tions, and recommendations used to create standard nutrition policy.”
5
Introduction

This time, the same smart fella is pointing to clear, concise explanations of
technical terms and processes — details that are interesting but not neces-
sarily critical to your understanding of a topic. In other words, skip them if
you want, but try a few first.
Bull’s-eye! This is time- and stress-saving information that you can use to
improve your diet and health.
This is a watch-out-for-the-curves icon, alerting you to nutrition pitfalls such
as (oops!) leaving the skin on the chicken — turning a low-fat food into one
that is high in fat and cholesterol. This icon also warns you about physical
dangers such as supplements to avoid because they may do more damage
than good to your health.
Where to Go from Here
Ah, here’s the best part. For Dummies books are not linear (a fancy way of
saying they proceed from A to B to C . . . and so on). In fact, you can dive
right in anywhere, say at L, M, or N, and still make sense of what you’re 
reading because each chapter delivers a complete message.
For example, if carbohydrates are your passion, go right to Chapter 8. If you
want to know how to pick and choose from a menu when you’re eating out,
skip to Chapter 18. If you’ve always been fascinated by food processing, 
your choice is Chapter 19. You can use the Table of Contents to find broad
categories of information or the Index to look up more specific things.
If you’re not sure where you want to go, why not just begin at the beginning,
Part I? It gives you all the basic info you need to understand nutrition and
points to places where you can find more detailed information.

about Nutrition

In this part . . .
T
o use food wisely, you need a firm grasp of the basics.
In this part, I define nutrition and give you a detailed
explanation of digestion (how your body turns food into
nutrients). I also explain why calories are useful and set
forth a no-nonsense starter guide to your daily require-
ments of vitamins, minerals, and other good stuff.

W
elcome aboard! You’re about to begin your very own Fantastic Voyage.

check out the next showing on your favorite cable movie channel.)
In any event, as you read, chapter by chapter, you can follow a route that car-
ries food (meaning food and beverages) from your plate to your mouth to
your digestive tract and into every tissue and cell. Along the way, you’ll have
the opportunity to see how your organs and systems work. You’ll observe
firsthand why some foods and beverages are essential to your health. And
you’ll discover how to manage your diet so you can get the biggest bang
(nutrients) for your buck (calories). Bon voyage!
Nutrition Equals Life
Technically speaking, nutrition is the science of how the body uses food. In
fact, nutrition is life. All living things, including you, need food and water to
live. Beyond that, you need good food, meaning food with the proper nutri-
ents, to live well. If you don’t eat and drink, you’ll die. Period. If you don’t eat
and drink nutritious food and beverages:
 Your bones may bend or break (not enough calcium).
 Your gums may bleed (not enough vitamin C).
 Your blood may not carry oxygen to every cell (not enough iron).

And on, and on, and on. Understanding how good nutrition protects you
against these dire consequences requires a familiarity with the language and
concepts of nutrition. Knowing some basic chemistry is helpful (don’t panic:
Chemistry can be a cinch when you read about it in plain English). A smatter-
ing of sociology and psychology is also useful, because although nutrition is
mostly about how food revs up and sustains your body, it’s also about the
cultural traditions and individual differences that explain how you choose
your favorite foods (see Chapter 15).
To sum it up: Nutrition is about why you eat what you eat and how the food
you get affects your body and your health.
First principles: Energy and nutrients
Nutrition’s primary task is figuring out which foods and beverages (in what
quantities) provide the energy and building material you need to construct
and maintain every organ and system. To do this, nutrition concentrates on
food’s two basic attributes: energy and nutrients.
10
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 
Essential nutrients for Fido, 
Fluffy, and your pet petunia
Vitamin C isn’t the only nutrient that’s essential for
one species but not for others. Many organic
compounds (substances similar to vitamins) and
elements (minerals) are essential for your green
or furry friends but not for you, either because you
can synthesize them from the food you eat or
because they’re so widely available in the human
diet and you require such small amounts that you
can get what you need without hardly trying.
Two good examples are the organic compounds
choline and myoinositol. Choline is an essential
nutrient for several species of animals, includ-
ing dogs, cats, rats, and guinea pigs. Although
choline has now been declared essential for
human beings (more about that in Chapter 10),
human bodies produce choline on their own,
and you can get choline from eggs, liver, soy-
beans, cauliflower, and lettuce. Myoinositol is
an essential nutrient for gerbils and rats, but
human beings synthesize it naturally and use it
in many body processes, such as transmitting
signals between cells.
Here’s a handy list of nutrients that are essen-
tial for animals and/or plants but not for you:
Organic Compounds
Elements
Carnitine
Arsenic
Myoinositol
Cadmium
Taurine
Lead
Nickel
Silicon
Tin
Vanadium

Energy from food
Energy is the ability to do work. Virtually every bite of food gives you energy,
even when it doesn’t give you nutrients. The amount of energy in food is mea-
sured in calories, the amount of heat produced when food is burned (meta-
bolized) in your body cells. You can read all about calories in Chapter 3. But
right now, all you need to know is that food is the fuel on which your body
runs. Without enough food, you don’t have enough energy.
Nutrients in food
Nutrients are chemical substances your body uses to build, maintain, and
repair tissues. They also empower cells to send messages back and forth 
to conduct essential chemical reactions, such as the ones that make it 
possible for you to
 Breathe
 See
 Move
 Hear
 Eliminate waste
 Smell
 Think
 Taste
. . . and do everything else natural to a living body.
Food provides two distinct groups of nutrients:
 Macronutrients (macro = big): Protein, fat, carbohydrates, and water
 Micronutrients (micro = small): Vitamins and minerals
What’s the difference between these two groups? The amount you need each
day. Your daily requirements for macronutrients generally exceed 1 gram.
(For comparison’s sake, 28 grams are in an ounce.) For example, a man needs
about 63 grams of protein a day (slightly more than two ounces), and a
woman needs 50 grams (slightly less than two ounces).
Your daily requirements for micronutrients are much smaller. For example,
the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin C is measured in mil-
ligrams (1⁄1,000 of a gram), while the RDAs for vitamin D, vitamin B12, and folate
are even smaller and are measured in micrograms (1⁄1,000,000 of a gram). You can
find out much more about the RDAs, including how they vary for people of
different ages, in Chapter 4.
11
Chapter 1: What’s Nutrition, Anyway?

What’s an essential nutrient?
A reasonable person may assume that an essential nutrient is one you need
to sustain a healthy body. But who says a reasonable person thinks like a
nutritionist? In nutritionspeak, an essential nutrient is a very special thing:
 An essential nutrient cannot be manufactured in the body. You have to
get essential nutrients from food or from a nutritional supplement.
 An essential nutrient is linked to a specific deficiency disease. For
example, people who go without protein for extended periods of time
develop the protein-deficiency disease kwashiorkor. People who don’t
get enough vitamin C develop the vitamin C–deficiency disease scurvy. A
diet rich in the essential nutrient cures the deficiency disease, but you
need the proper nutrient. In other words, you can’t cure a protein defi-
ciency with extra amounts of vitamin C.
Not all nutrients are essential for all species of animals. For example, vitamin
C is an essential nutrient for human beings but not for dogs. A dog’s body
makes the vitamin C it needs. Check out the list of nutrients on a can or bag
of dog food. See? No C. The dog already has the C it — sorry, he or she —
requires.
Essential nutrients for human beings include many well-known vitamins and
minerals, several amino acids (the so-called building blocks of proteins), 
and at least two fatty acids. For more about these essential nutrients, see
Chapters 6, 7, 10, and 11.
Protecting the nutrients in your food
Identifying nutrients is one thing. Making sure you get them into your body 
is another. Here, the essential idea is to keep nutritious food nutritious by
preserving and protecting its components.
Some people see the term food processing as a nutritional dirty word. Or
words. They’re wrong. Without food processing and preservatives, you and 
I would still be forced to gather (or kill) our food each morning and down 
it fast before it spoiled. For more about which processing and preservative
techniques produce the safest, most nutritious — and yes, delicious — 
dinners, check out Chapters 19, 20, 21 and 22.
Considering how vital food preservation can be, you may want to think about
when you last heard a rousing cheer for the anonymous cook who first
noticed that salting or pickling food could extend food’s shelf life. Or for 
12
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

the guys who invented the refrigeration and freezing techniques that slow
food’s natural tendency to degrade (translation: spoil). Or for Louis Pasteur,
the man who made it ab-so-lute-ly clear that heating food to boiling kills bugs
that might otherwise cause food poisoning. Hardly ever, that’s when. So give
them a hand, right here. Cool.
Other interesting substances in food
The latest flash in the nutrition sky is caused by phytochemicals. Phyto is the
Greek word for plants, so phytochemicals are simply — yes, you’ve got it —
chemicals from plants. Although the 13-letter group name may be new to you,
you’re already familiar with some phytochemicals. Vitamins are phytochemi-
cals. Pigments such as beta carotene, the deep yellow coloring in fruits and
vegetables that your body can convert to a form of vitamin A, are phyto-
chemicals.
And then there are phytoestrogens, hormone-like chemicals that grabbed the
spotlight when it was suggested that a diet high in phytoestrogens, such as
the isoflavones found in soybeans, may lower the risk of heart disease and
reduce the incidence of reproductive cancers (cancers of the breast, ovary,
uterus, and prostate). More recent studies suggest that phytoestrogens may
have some problems of their own, so to find out more about phytochemicals,
including phytoestrogens, check out Chapter 12.
You are what you eat
Oh boy, I bet you’ve heard this one before. But it bears repeating, because
the human body really is built from the nutrients it gets from food: water, pro-
tein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. On average, when you step
on the scale
 About 60 percent of your weight is water.
 About 20 percent of your weight is fat.
 About 20 percent of your weight is a combination of mostly protein
(especially in your muscles) plus carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins.
An easy way to remember your body’s percentage of water, fat, and protein
and other nutrients is to think of it as the “60-20-20 Rule.”
13
Chapter 1: What’s Nutrition, Anyway?

Your nutritional status
Nutritional status is a phrase that describes the state of your health as related
to your diet. For example, people who are starving do not get the nutrients or
calories they need for optimum health. These people are said to be malnour-
ished (mal = bad), which means their nutritional status is, to put it gently, def-
initely not good. Malnutrition may arise from
 A diet that doesn’t provide enough food. This situation can occur in
times of famine or through voluntary starvation because of an eating 
disorder or because something in your life disturbs your appetite. For
example, older people may be at risk of malnutrition because of tooth
loss or age-related loss of appetite or because they live alone and some-
times just forget to eat.
14
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 
What’s a body made of?
Sugar and spice and everything nice . . . Oops.
What I meant to say was the human body is
made of water and fat and protein and carbo-
hydrates and vitamins and minerals.
On average, when you step on the scale, approx-
imately 60 percent of your weight is water, 20
percent is body fat (slightly less for a man), and
20 percent is a combination of mostly protein,
plus carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and other
naturally occurring biochemicals.
Based on these percentages, you can reason-
ably expect that an average 140-pound person’s
body weight consists of about
 84 pounds of water
 28 pounds of body fat
 28 pounds of a combination of protein (up 
to 25 pounds), minerals (up to 7 pounds),
carbohydrates (up to 1.4 pounds), and vita-
mins (a trace).
Yep, you’re right: Those last figures do total
more than 28 pounds. That’s because “up to”
(as in “up to 25 pounds of protein”) means that
the amounts may vary from person to person.
For example, a young person’s body has propor-
tionately more muscle and less fat than an older
person’s, while a woman’s body has proportion-
ately less muscle and more fat than a man’s. As
a result, more of a man’s weight comes from pro-
tein and calcium, while more of a woman’s body
comes from fat. Protein-packed muscles and
mineral-packed bones are denser tissue than fat.
Weigh a man and a woman of roughly the same
height and size, and he’s likely to tip the scale
higher every time.

 A diet that, while otherwise adequate, is deficient in a specific nutri-
ent. This kind of nutritional inadequacy can lead to — surprise! — a defi-
ciency disease, such as beriberi, the disease caused by a lack of vitamin
B1 (thiamine).
 A metabolic disorder or medical condition that prevents your body
from absorbing specific nutrients, such as carbohydrates or protein.
One common example is diabetes, the inability to produce enough
insulin, the hormone your body uses to metabolize (digest) carbohy-
drates. Another is celiac disease, a condition that makes it impossible
for the body to digest gluten, a protein in wheat. Need more info on
either diabetes or celiac disease? Check out Diabetes For Dummies, 
2nd Edition, and Living Gluten-Free for Dummies. Of course.
Doctors and registered dieticians have many tools with which to rate your
nutritional status. For example, they can
 Review your medical history to see whether you have any conditions
(such as dentures) that may make eating certain foods difficult or that
interfere with your ability to absorb nutrients.
 Perform a physical examination to look for obvious signs of nutritional
deficiency, such as dull hair and eyes (a lack of vitamins?), poor posture
(not enough calcium to protect the spinal bones?), or extreme thinness
(not enough food? An underlying disease?).
 Order laboratory blood and urine tests that may identify early signs of
malnutrition, such as the lack of red blood cells that characterizes
anemia caused by an iron deficiency.
At every stage of life, the aim of a good diet is to maintain a healthy nutri-
tional status.
Fitting food into the medicine chest
Food is medicine for the body and the soul. Good meals make good friends,
and modern research validates the virtues of not only Granny’s chicken 
soup but also heart-healthy sulfur compounds in garlic and onions, anti-
cholesterol dietary fiber in grains and beans, bone-building calcium in milk
and greens, and mood elevators in coffee, tea, and chocolate.
Of course, foods pose some risks as well: food allergies, food intolerances,
food and drug interactions, and the occasional harmful substances such as
the dreaded saturated fats and trans fats (quick — Chapter 7!). In other words,
constructing a healthful diet can mean tailoring food choices to your own
special body. Not to worry: You can do it. Especially after reading through
Part V. Would a For Dummies book leave you unarmed? Not a chance!

Finding Nutrition Facts
Getting reliable information about nutrition can be a daunting challenge. For
the most part, your nutrition information is likely to come from TV and radio
talk shows or news, your daily newspaper, your favorite magazine, a variety
of nutrition-oriented books, and the Internet. How can you tell whether what

Nutritional people
The people who make nutrition news may be scientists, reporters, or simply
someone who wandered in with a new theory (Artichokes prevent cancer!
Never eat cherries and cheese at the same meal! Vitamin C gives you hives!),
the more bizarre the better. But several groups of people are most likely to
give you news you can use with confidence. For example:
 Nutrition scientists: These are people with graduate degrees (usually in
chemistry, biology, biochemistry, or physics) engaged in research deal-
ing primarily with the effects of food on animals and human beings.
 Nutrition researchers: Researchers may be either nutrition scientists 
or professionals in another field, such as medicine or sociology, whose
research (study or studies) concentrates on the effects of food.
 Nutritionists: These are people who concentrate on the study of nutri-
tion. In some states, a person who uses the title “nutritionist” must have
a graduate degree in basic science courses related to nutrition.
 Dietitians: These people have undergraduate degrees in food and nutri-
tion science or the management of food programs. A person with the 
letters R.D. after his or her name has completed a dietetic internship
and passed an American Dietetic Association licensing exam.
 Nutrition reporters and writers: These are people who specialize in
giving you information about the medical and/or scientific aspects of
food. Like reporters who concentrate on politics or sports, nutrition
reporters gain their expertise through years of covering their beat. Most
have the science background required to translate technical information
into language nonscientists can understand; some have been trained as
dietitians, nutritionists, or nutrition scientists.
Consumer alert: Regardless of the source, nutrition news should always pass
what you may call The Reasonableness Test. In other words, if a story or
report or study sounds ridiculous, it probably is.

Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

Can you trust this study?
You open your morning newspaper or turn on the evening news and read or
hear that a group of researchers at an impeccably prestigious scientific orga-
nization has published a study showing that yet another thing you’ve always
taken for granted is hazardous to your health. For example, the study says
drinking coffee stresses your heart, adding salt to food raises blood pressure,
or fatty foods increase your risk of cancer or heart disease.
So you throw out the offending food or drink or rearrange your daily routine
to avoid the once-acceptable, now-dangerous food, beverage, or additive.
And then what happens? Two weeks, two months, or two years down the
road, a second, equally prestigious group of scientists publishes a study con-
clusively proving that the first group got it wrong: In fact, this study shows
coffee has no effect on the risk of heart disease — and may even improve ath-
letic performance; salt does not cause hypertension except in certain sensi-
tive individuals; only some fatty foods are risky.
Who’s right? Nobody seems to know. That leaves you, a layperson, on your
own to come up with the answer. Never fear — you may not be a nutritionist,
but that doesn’t mean you can’t apply a few common-sense rules to any
study you read about, rules that say: “Yes, this may be true,” or “No, this 
may not be.”
Does this study include human beings?
True, animal studies can alert researchers to potential problems, but working
with animals alone cannot give you conclusive proof.
Different species react differently to various chemicals and diseases. For exam-
ple, although cows and horses can digest grass and hay, human being can’t.
And while outright poisons such as cyanide clearly traumatize any living body,
many foods or drugs that harm a laboratory rat won’t harm you. And vice
versa. For example, mouse and rat embryos suffer no ill effects when their
mothers are given thalidomide, the sedative that’s known to cause deformed
fetal limbs when given to pregnant monkeys — and human beings — at the
point in pregnancy when limbs are developing. (And here’s an astounding turn:
Modern research shows that thalidomide is beneficial for treating or prevent-
ing human skin problems related to Hansen’s disease [leprosy], cancer, and/or
autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which the body mis-
takenly attacks its own tissues.)
Are enough people in this study?
Hey, researchers’ saying, “Well, I did give this to a couple of people,” is simply
not enough. The study must include sufficient numbers and a variety of indi-
viduals, too. If you don’t have enough people in the study — several hundred
to many thousand — to establish a pattern, there’s always the possibility that
an effect occurred by chance.
17
Chapter 1: What’s Nutrition, Anyway?

If you don’t include different types of people, which generally means young
and old men and women of different racial and ethnic groups, your results
may not apply across the board. For example, the original studies linking
high blood cholesterol levels to an increased risk of heart disease and linking
small doses of aspirin to a reduced risk of a second heart attack involved
only men. It wasn’t until follow-up studies were conducted with women that
researchers were able to say with any certainty that high cholesterol is dan-
gerous and aspirin is protective for women as well — but not in quite the
same way: In January 2006, the Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that men taking low dose aspirin tend to lower their risk of heart
attack. For women, the aspirin reduces the risk of stroke. Vive la difference!
Is there anything in the design or method of this study 
that may affect the accuracy of its conclusions?
Some testing methods are more likely to lead to biased or inaccurate conclu-
sions. For example, a retrospective study (which asks people to tell what they
did in the past) is always considered less accurate than a prospective study
(one that follows people while they’re actually doing what the researchers 
are studying), because memory isn’t always accurate. People tend to forget
details or, without meaning to, alter them to fit the researchers’ questions.
Are the study’s conclusions reasonable?
When a study comes up with a conclusion that seems illogical to you, chances
are the researchers feel the same way. For example, in 1990, the long-running
Nurses’ Study at the Harvard School of Public Health reported that a high-fat
diet raised the risk of colon cancer. But the data showed a link only to diets
high in beef. No link was found to diets high in dairy fat. In short, this study
was begging for a second study to confirm (or deny) its results.
And while we wait for that second and, naturally, third study, you can bet
we’re keeping an open mind. The nature of life is that things do change, 
sometimes in surprising ways. Consider dioxin, a toxic contaminant found in
some fish. Consider Olestra, the calorie-free fat substitute that makes some
tummies rumble. As you read this page, dioxin’s still a bad actor, but in 2005
researchers at the University of Cincinnati and the University of Western
Australia announced that eating foods containing Olestra may speed your
body’s elimination of — you guessed it — dioxin. A-maz-ing.

In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with your digestive organs
 Following the food through your body
 Absorbing nutrients and passing them along to your body
W
hen you see (or smell) something appetizing, your digestive organs leap
into action. Your mouth waters. Your stomach contracts. Intestinal
glands begin to secrete the chemicals that turn food into the nutrients that
build new tissues and provide the energy you need to keep zipping through 
the days, months, and years.
This chapter introduces you to your digestive system and explains exactly
how your body digests the many different kinds of foods you eat, all the while
extracting the nutrients you need to keep on truckin’.
Introducing the Digestive System
Your digestive system may never win a Tony, Oscar, or Emmy, but it certainly
deserves your applause for its ability to turn complex food into basic nutri-
ents. Doing this requires not a cast of thousands but a group of digestive
organs, each designed specifically to perform one role in the two-part process.
Read on.

The digestive organs
Although exceedingly well-organized, your digestive system is basically one
long tube that starts at your mouth, continues down through your throat to
your stomach, and then goes on to your small and large intestines and past
the rectum to end at your anus.
In between, with the help of the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder, the usable
(digestible) parts of everything that you eat are converted to simple com-
pounds that your body can easily absorb to burn for energy or to build new
tissue. The indigestible residue is bundled off and eliminated as waste.
Figure 2-1 shows the body parts and organs that comprise your digestive
system.

Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

Digestion: A two-part process
Digestion is a two-part process — half mechanical, half chemical:
 Mechanical digestion takes place in your mouth and your stomach. Your
teeth break food into small pieces that you can swallow without chok-
ing. In your stomach, a churning action continues to break food into
smaller particles.
 Chemical digestion occurs at every point in the digestive tract where
enzymes and other substances, such as hydrochloric acid (from stomach
glands) and bile (from the liver), dissolve food, releasing the nutrients
inside.
Understanding How Your 
Body Digests Food
Each organ in the digestive system plays a specific role in the digestive
drama. But the first act occurs in two places that are never listed as part of
the digestive tract: your eyes and nose.
The eyes and nose
When you see appetizing food, you experience a conditioned response. (For
the lowdown on how your digestive system can be conditioned to respond 
to food, see Chapter 14; for information on your food preferences, see
Chapter 15). In other words, your thoughts — “Wow! That looks good!” —
stimulate your brain to tell your digestive organs to get ready for action.
What happens in your nose is purely physical. The tantalizing aroma of good
food is transmitted by molecules that fly from the surface of the food to settle
on the membrane lining of your nostrils; these molecules stimulate the recep-
tor cells on the olfactory nerve fibers that stretch from your nose back to
your brain. When the receptor cells communicate with your brain — “Listen
up, there’s good stuff here!” — your brain sends encouraging messages to
your mouth and digestive tract.
In both cases — eyes and nose — the results are the same: “Start the saliva
flowing,” they say. “Warm up the stomach glands. Alert the small intestine.” In
other words, the sight and scent of food has made your mouth water and
your stomach contract in anticipatory hunger pangs.
21
Chapter 2: Digestion: The 24-Hour Food Factory

But wait! Suppose you hate what you see or smell? For some people, even the
thought of liver is enough to make them want to barf — or simply leave the
room. At that point, your body takes up arms to protect you: You experience
a rejection reaction — a reaction similar to that exhibited by babies given
something that tastes bitter or sour. Your mouth purses and your nose wrin-
kles as if to keep the food (and its odor) as far away as possible. Your throat
tightens, and your stomach turns — muscles contracting not in anticipatory
pangs but in movements preparatory for vomiting up the unwanted food. Not
a pleasant moment.
But assume you like what’s on your plate. Go ahead. Take a bite.
The mouth
Lift your fork to your mouth, and your teeth and salivary glands swing into
action. Your teeth chew, grinding the food, breaking it into small, manageable
pieces. As a result:
 You can swallow without choking.
 You break down the indigestible wrapper of fibers surrounding the
edible parts of some foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains) so that 
your digestive enzymes can get to the nutrients inside.
At the same time, salivary glands under your tongue and in the back of your
mouth secrete the watery liquid called saliva, which performs two important
functions:
 Moistening and compacting food so that your tongue can push it to the
back of your mouth and you can swallow, sending the food down the
slide of your gullet (esophagus) into your stomach.
 Providing amylases, enzymes that start the digestion of complex carbo-
hydrates (starches), breaking the starch molecules into simple sugars
(Check out Chapter 8 for more on carbs.)
No protein digestion occurs in your mouth, though saliva does contain very
small amounts of lingual lipases, fat-busting enzymes secreted by cells at the
base of the tongue; however, the amount is so small that the fat digestion that
occurs in the mouth is insignificant.
The stomach
If you were to lay your digestive tract out on a table, most of it would look
like a simple, rather narrow tube. The exception is your stomach, a pouchy
part just below your gullet (esophagus).
22
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

Like most of the digestive tube, your stomach is circled with strong muscles
whose rhythmic contractions — called peristalsis — move food smartly along
and turn your stomach into a sort of food processor that mechanically breaks
pieces of food into ever smaller particles. While this is going on, glands in the
stomach wall are secreting stomach juices — a potent blend of enzymes,
hydrochloric acid, and mucus.
One stomach enzyme — gastric alcohol dehydrogenase — digests small
amounts of alcohol, an unusual nutrient that can be absorbed directly into
your bloodstream even before it’s been digested. For more about alcohol
digestion, including why men can drink more than women without becoming
tipsy, see Chapter 9.
Other enzymes, plus stomach juices, begin the digestion of proteins and fats,
separating them into their basic components — amino acids and fatty acids.
Stop! If the words amino acids and fatty acids are completely new to you 
and if you are suddenly consumed by the desire to know more about them
this instant, stick a pencil in the book to hold your place and flip ahead to
Chapters 6 and 7, where I discuss them in detail.
Stop again!! For the most part, digestion of carbohydrates comes to a
screeching — though temporary — halt in the stomach because the stomach
juices are so acidic that they deactivate amylases, the enzymes that break
complex carbohydrates apart into simple sugars. However, stomach acid can
break some carbohydrate bonds, so a bit of carb digestion does take place.
23
Chapter 2: Digestion: The 24-Hour Food Factory
Turning starches into sugars
Salivary enzymes (like amylases) don’t lay a
finger on proteins and leave fats pretty much
alone, but they do begin to digest complex car-
bohydrates, breaking the long, chainlike mole-
cules of starches into individual units of sugars;
this simple experiment enables you to taste first-
hand the effects of amylases on carbohydrates.
1. Put a small piece of plain, unsalted cracker
on your tongue.
No cheese, no chopped liver — just the
cracker, please.
2. Close your mouth and let the cracker sit on
your tongue for a few minutes.
Do you taste a sudden, slight sweetness?
That’s the salivary enzymes breaking a long,
complex starch molecule into its compo-
nent parts (sugars).
3. Okay, you can swallow now.
The rest of the digestion of the starch takes
place farther down, in your small intestine.

Back to the action. Eventually, your churning stomach blends its contents
into a thick soupy mass called chyme (from cheymos, the Greek word for
juice). When a small amount of chyme spills past the stomach into the small
intestine, the digestion of carbohydrates resumes in earnest, and your body
begins to extract nutrients from food.
The small intestine
Open your hand and put it flat against your belly button, with your thumb
pointing up to your waist and your pinkie pointing down.
Your hand is now covering most of the relatively small space into which your
20-foot-long small (20 feet? small?) intestine is neatly coiled. When the soupy,
partially-digested chyme spills from your stomach into this part of the diges-
tive tube, a whole new set of gastric juices are released. These include:
 Pancreatic and intestinal enzymes that finish the digestion of proteins
into amino acids
 Bile, a greenish liquid (made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder)
that enables fats to mix with water
 Alkaline pancreatic juices that make the chyme less acidic so that amy-
lases (the enzymes that break down carbohydrates) can go back to work
separating complex carbohydrates into simple sugars
 Intestinal alcohol dehydrogenase, which digests alcohol not previously
absorbed into your bloodstream
While these chemicals are working, contractions of the small intestine con-
tinue to move the food mass down through the tube so that your body can
absorb sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals into cells in
the intestinal wall.
The lining of the small intestine is a series of folds covered with projections
that have been described as “finger-like” or “small nipples.” The technical
name for these small fingers/nipples is villi. Each villus is covered with
smaller projections called microvilli, and every villus and microvillus is 
programmed to accept a specific nutrient — and no other.
Nutrients are absorbed not in their order of arrival in the intestine but
according to how fast they’re broken down into their basic parts:
 Carbohydrates — which separate quickly into single sugar units — are
absorbed first.
 Proteins (as amino acids) go next.
24
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

 Fats — which take longest to break apart into their constituent fatty
acids — are last. That’s why a high-fat meal keeps you feeling fuller
longer than a meal such as chow mein or plain tossed salad, which are
mostly low-fat carbohydrates.
 Vitamins that dissolve in water are absorbed earlier than vitamins that
dissolve in fat.

Chapter 2: Digestion: The 24-Hour Food Factory
Peephole: The first man to watch 
a living human gut at work
William Beaumont, M.D., was a surgeon in the
United States Army in the early 19th century. His
name survives in the annals of medicine
because of an excellent adventure that began
on June 6, 1822. Alexis St. Martin, an 18-year-
old French Canadian fur trader, was wounded
by a musket ball that discharged accidentally,
tearing through his back and out his stomach,
leaving a wound that healed but didn’t close.
St. Martin’s injury seems not to have affected
what must have been a truly sunny disposition:
Two years later, when all efforts to close the
hole in his gut had failed, he granted Beaumont
permission to use the wound as the world’s first
window on a working human digestive system.
(To keep food and liquid from spilling out of the
small opening, Beaumont kept it covered with a
cotton bandage.)
Beaumont’s method was simplicity itself. At noon
on August 1, 1825, he tied small pieces of food
(cooked meat, raw meat, cabbage, bread) to a
silk string, removed the bandage, and inserted
the food into the hole in St. Martin’s stomach.
An hour later, he pulled the food out. The cab-
bage and bread were half digested; the meat,
untouched. After another hour, he pulled the
string out again. This time, only the raw meat
remained untouched, and St. Martin, who now
had a headache and a queasy stomach, called it
quits for the day. But in more than 230 later trials,
Beaumont — with the help of his remarkably
compliant patient — discovered that although
carbohydrates (cabbage and bread) were
digested rather quickly, it took up to eight hours
for the stomach juices to break down proteins
and fats (the beef). Beaumont attributed this to
the fact that the cabbage had been cut into small
pieces and the bread was porous. Modern nutri-
tionists know that carbohydrates are simply
digested faster than proteins and that digesting
fats (including those in beef) takes longest of all.
By withdrawing gastric fluid from St. Martin’s
stomach, keeping it at 100° F (the temperature
recorded on a thermometer stuck into the stom-
ach), and adding a piece of meat, Beaumont
was able to clock exactly how long the meat
took to fall apart: 10 hours.
Beaumont and St. Martin separated in 1833
when the patient, now a sergeant in the United
States Army, was posted elsewhere, leaving the
doctor to write “Experiments and Observations
on the Gastric Juice and the Physiology of
Digestion.” The treatise is now considered a
landmark in the understanding of the human
digestive system.

After you’ve digested your food and absorbed its nutrients through your
small intestine:
 Amino acids, sugars, vitamin C, the B vitamins, iron, calcium, and mag-
nesium are carried through the bloodstream to your liver, where they
are processed and sent out to the rest of the body.
 Fatty acids, cholesterol, and vitamins A, D, E, and K go into the lym-
phatic system and then into the blood. They, too, end up in the liver, are
processed, and are shipped out to other body cells.
Inside the cells, nutrients are metabolized, or burned for heat and energy or
used to build new tissues. The metabolic process that gives you energy is
called catabolism (from katabole, the Greek word for casting down). The meta-
bolic process that uses nutrients to build new tissues is called anabolism
(from anabole, the Greek word for raising up).
How the body uses nutrients for energy and new tissues is, alas, a subject for
another chapter. In fact, this subject is enough to fill seven different chapters,
each devoted to a specific kind of nutrient. For information about metaboliz-
ing proteins, turn to Chapter 6. I discuss fats in Chapter 7, carbohydrates in
Chapter 8, alcohol in Chapter 9, vitamins in Chapter 10, minerals in Chapter
11, and water in Chapter 13.
The large intestine
After every useful, digestible ingredient other than water has been wrung out
of your food, the rest — indigestible waste such as fiber — moves into the
top of your large intestine, the area known as your colon. The colon’s primary
job is to absorb water from this mixture and then to squeeze the remaining
matter into the compact bundle known as feces.
Feces (whose brown color comes from leftover bile pigments) are made of
indigestible material from food, plus cells that have sloughed off the intesti-
nal lining and bacteria — quite a lot of bacteria. In fact, about 30 percent of
the entire weight of the feces is bacteria. No, these bacteria aren’t a sign
you’re sick. On the contrary, they prove that you’re healthy and well. These
bacteria are good guys, microorganisms that live in permanent colonies in
your colon, where they:
 Manufacture vitamin B12, which is absorbed through the colon wall
 Produce vitamin K, also absorbed through the colon wall
 Break down amino acids and produce nitrogen (which gives feces a
characteristic odor)
 Feast on indigestible complex carbohydrates (fiber), excreting the gas
that sometimes makes you physically uncomfortable — or a social
pariah

Chew! Chew! All aboard the Nutrient Express!
Think of your small intestine as a busy train station whose apparent chaos of arrivals and departures
is actually an efficient, well-ordered system. (Please forgive the terrible pun in the title of this side-
bar. My husband — who inherited a gift for this sort of thing from his mother — made me do it.)
As I was saying, the small intestine resembles a three-level, miniature Grand Central Terminal:
 Level 1 is the duodenum (at the top, right after your stomach).
 Level 2 is the jejunum (in the middle).
 Level 3 is the ileum (the last part before the colon).
This three-station tube hums away as nutrients arrive and depart, with millions of “trains” (the nutri-
ents) running on millions of “tracks” (the microvilli) designed to accommodate only one kind of 
train — and no other.
The system absorbs and ships out nutrients accounting for more than 90 percent of all the protein,
fat, and carbohydrates that you consume, plus smaller percentages of vitamins and minerals. The
train schedule looks something like this:
Level 1
Duodenum
Iron, calcium, magnesium
Level 2
Jejunum
Simple sugars (the end products of carbohydrate digestion) and water-
soluble vitamins (vitamin C and the B vitamins, other than vitamin B12)
Level 3
Ileum
Amino acids (the end product of protein digestion), fat-soluble vitamins
(vitamins A, D, E, and K), fatty acids (the end products of fat digestion),
cholesterol, vitamin B12, sodium, potassium, and alcohol

When the bacteria have finished, the feces — perhaps the small remains of
yesterday’s copious feast — pass down through your rectum and out through
your anus. But not necessarily right away: Digestion of any one meal may
take longer than a day to complete.
After that, digestion’s done!

 Understanding why not all calories deliver the same nutrition

 Estimating whether you’re at a healthful weight
A
utomobiles burn gasoline to get the energy they need to move. Your
body burns (metabolizes) food to produce energy in the form of heat.
This heat warms your body and (as energy) powers every move you make.
Nutritionists measure the amount of heat produced by metabolizing food in
units called kilocalories. A kilocalorie is the amount of energy it takes to raise
the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree on a Centigrade (Celsius)
thermometer at sea level.
In common use, nutritionists substitute the word calorie for kilocalorie. This
information isn’t scientifically accurate: Strictly speaking, a calorie is really
1⁄1000 of a kilocalorie. But the word calorie is easier to say and easier to remem-
ber, so that’s the term you see whenever you read about the energy in food.
And few nutrition-related words have caused as much confusion and concern
as the lowly calorie. Read on to find out what calories mean to you and your
nutrition.
Counting the Calories in Food
When you read that a serving of food — say, one banana — has 105 calories,
that means metabolizing the banana produces 105 calories of heat that your
body can use for work.

You may wonder which kinds of food have the most calories. Here’s how the
calories measure up in 1 gram of the following foods:
 Protein: 4 calories
 Carbohydrates: 4 calories
 Alcohol: 7 calories
 Fat: 9 calories
In other words, ounce for ounce, proteins and carbohydrates give you fewer
than half as many calories as fat. That’s why — again, ounce for ounce —
high-fat foods, such as cream cheese, are high in calories, while low-fat foods,
such as bagels (minus the cream cheese, of course), are not.
Sometimes foods that seem to be equally low-calorie really aren’t. You have
to watch all the angles, paying attention to fat in addition to protein and car-
bohydrates. Here’s a good example: A chicken breast and a hamburger are
both high-protein foods. Both should have the same number of calories per
ounce. But if you serve the chicken without its skin, it contains very little fat,
while the hamburger is (sorry about this) full of it. A 3-ounce serving of skin-
less chicken provides 140 calories, while a 3-ounce burger yields 230 to 245
calories, depending on the cut of the meat.
Empty calories
All food provides calories. All calories provide energy. But not all calories
come with a full complement of extra benefits such as amino acids, fatty
acids, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Some foods are said to give you empty
calories. This term has nothing to do with the calorie’s energy potential or
with calories having a hole in the middle. It describes a calorie with no extra
benefits.
The best-known empty-calorie foods are table sugar and ethanol (the kind of
alcohol found in beer, wine, and spirits). On their own, sugar and ethanol give
you energy — but no nutrients. (See Chapter 8 for more about sugar and
Chapter 9 for more about alcohol.)
People who abuse alcohol aren’t always thin, but the fact that they often sub-
stitute alcohol for food can lead to nutritional deficiencies, most commonly a
deficiency of thiamin (vitamin B1), resulting in loss of appetite, an upset
stomach, depression, and an inability to concentrate. (For more on vitamin
deficiency problems, check out Chapter 10.)
30
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

Of course, it’s only fair to point out that sugar and alcohol are ingredients
often found in foods that do provide other nutrients. For example, sugar is
found in bread, and alcohol is found in beer — two very different foods that
both have calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, sodium, and B vitamins.
In the United States, some people are malnourished because they can’t 
afford enough food to get the nutrients they need. The school lunch program
started by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1935 and expanded by
almost every president, Republican and Democrat, since then has been 
a largely successful attempt to prevent malnutrition among poor 
schoolchildren.
31
Chapter 3: Calories: The Energizers
Measuring the number of calories
Nutrition scientists measure the number of calo-
ries in food by actually burning the food in a
bomb calorimeter, which is a box with two cham-
bers, one inside the other. The researchers
weigh a sample of the food, put the sample on a
dish, and put the dish into the inner chamber of
the calorimeter. They fill the inner chamber with
oxygen and then seal it so the oxygen can’t
escape. The outer chamber is filled with a 
measured amount of cold water, and the oxygen
in the first chamber (inside the chamber with the
water) is ignited with an electric spark. When the
food burns, an observer records the rise in the
temperature of the water in the outer chamber.
If the temperature of the water goes up 1 degree
per kilogram, the food has 1 calorie; 2 degrees, 2
calories; and 235 degrees, 235 calories — or one
8-ounce chocolate malt!

But many Americans who can afford enough food nevertheless are malnour-
ished because they simply don’t know how to choose a diet that gives them
nutrients as well as calories. For these people, eating too many foods with
empty calories can cause significant health problems, such as having weak
bones; being underweight (yes, being too thin can be a problem); getting
bleeding gums, skin rashes, and other nasties; and developing mental dis-
orders, including depression and preventable retardation.
Every calorie counts
People who say that “calories don’t count” or that “some calories count less
than others” are usually trying to convince you to follow a diet that concen-
trates on one kind of food to the exclusion of most others. One common
example that seems to arise like a phoenix in every generation of dieters is
the high-protein diet.
The high-protein diet says to cut back or even entirely eliminate carbohy-
drate foods on the assumption that because your muscle tissue is mostly pro-
tein, the protein foods you eat will go straight from your stomach to your
muscles, while everything else turns to fat. In other words, this diet says that
you can stuff yourself with protein foods until your eyes bug out, because no
matter how many calories you get, they’ll all be protein calories and they’ll
all end up in your muscles, not on your hips. Boy, wouldn’t it be nice if that
were true? The problem is, it isn’t. Here’s the absolute truth: All calories,
regardless of where they come from, give you energy. If you take in more
energy (calories) than you spend each day, you’ll gain weight. If you take in
less than you use up, you’ll lose weight. This nutrition rule is an equal oppor-
tunity, one-size-fits-all proposition that applies to everyone.
How Many Calories Do You Need?
Think of your energy requirements as a bank account. You make deposits
when you consume calories. You make withdrawals when your body spends
energy on work. Nutritionists divide the amount of energy you withdraw each
day into two parts:
 The energy you need when your body is at rest
 The energy you need to do your daily “work”
To keep your energy account in balance, you need to take in enough each day
to cover your withdrawals. As a general rule, infants and adolescents burn

more energy per pound than adults do, because they’re continually making
large amounts of new tissue. Similarly, an average man burns more energy
than an average woman because his body is larger and has more muscle,
thus leading to the totally unfair but totally true proposition that a man who
weighs, say, 150 pounds can consume about 10 percent more calories than a
woman who weighs 150 pounds and still not gain weight. For the numbers,
check out the next section and Table 3-1.
Resting energy expenditure (REE)
Even when you’re at rest, your body is busy. Your heart beats. Your lungs
expand and contract. Your intestines digest food. Your liver processes nutri-
ents. Your glands secrete hormones. Your muscles flex, usually gently. Cells
send electrical impulses back and forth among themselves, and your brain
continually signals to every part of your body.
The energy that your resting body uses to do all this stuff is called (surprise!
surprise!) resting energy expenditure, abbreviated REE. The REE, also known
as the basal metabolism, accounts for a whopping 60 to 70 percent of all the
energy you need each day.
To find your resting energy expenditure (REE), you must first figure out your
weight in kilograms (kg). One kilogram equals 2.2 pounds. So to get your
weight in kilograms, divide the number in pounds by 2.2. For example, if you
weigh 150 pounds, that’s equal to 68.2 kg (150 ÷ 2.2). Plug that into the appro-
priate equation in Table 3-1 — and bingo! You have your REE.

Sex, glands, and chocolate cake
A gland is an organ that secretes hormones, which are chemical substances
that can change the function — and sometimes the structure — of other body
parts. For example, your pancreas secretes insulin, a hormone that enables
you to digest and metabolize carbohydrates. At puberty, your sex glands
secrete either the female hormones estrogen and progesterone or the male
hormone testosterone; these hormones trigger the development of sec-
ondary sex characteristics, such as the body and facial hair that make us
look like either men or women.
Hormones can also affect your REE, how much energy you use when your
body’s at rest. Your pituitary gland, a small structure in the center of your
brain, stimulates your thyroid gland (which sits at the front of your throat) 
to secrete hormones that influence the rate at which your tissues burn 
nutrients to produce energy.
When your thyroid gland doesn’t secrete enough hormones (a condition
known as hypothyroidism), you burn food more slowly and your REE drops.
When your thyroid secretes excess amounts of hormones (a condition 
known as hyperthyroidism), you burn food faster and your REE is higher.
When you’re frightened or excited, your adrenal glands (two small glands,
one on top of each kidney) release adrenaline, the hormone that serves as
your body’s call to battle stations. Your heartbeat increases. You breathe
faster. Your muscles clench. And you burn food faster, converting it as fast as
possible to the energy you need for the reaction commonly known as fight or
flight. But these effects are temporary. The effects of the sex glands, on the
other hand, last as long as you live. Read on.
How your hormones affect your energy needs
If you’re a woman, you know that your appetite rises and falls in tune with
your menstrual cycle. In fact, this fluctuation parallels what’s happening to
your REE, which goes up just before or at the time of ovulation. Your appetite
is highest when menstrual bleeding starts and then falls sharply. Yes, you
really are hungrier (and need more energy) just before you get your period.
Being a man (and making lots of testosterone) makes satisfying your nutri-
tional needs on a normal American diet easier. Your male bones are naturally
denser, so you’re less dependent on dietary or supplemental calcium to pre-
vent osteoporosis (severe loss of bone tissue) late in life. You don’t lose blood
through menstruation, so you need only two-thirds as much iron. Best of all,
you can consume about 10 percent more calories than a woman of the same
weight without adding pounds.
34
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

Teenage boys’ developing wide shoulders and biceps while teenage girls get
hips is no accident. Testosterone, the male hormone, promotes the growth of
muscle and bone. Estrogen gives you fatty tissue. As a result, the average
male body has proportionally more muscle; the average female body, propor-
tionally more fat.
Muscle is active tissue. It expands and contracts. It works. And when a
muscle works, it uses more energy than fat (which insulates the body and
provides a source of stored energy but does not move an inch on its own).
What this muscle versus fat battle means is that the average man’s REE is
about 10 percent higher than the average woman’s. In practical terms, that
means a 140-pound man can hold his weight steady while eating about 10 per-
cent more than a 140-pound woman who is the same age and performs the
same amount of physical work.
No amount of dieting changes this unfair situation. A woman who exercises
strenuously may reduce her body fat so dramatically that she no longer 
menstruates — an occupational hazard for some professional athletes. But
she’ll still have proportionately more body fat than an adult man of the same
weight. If she eats what he does, and they perform the same amount of physi-
cal work, she still requires fewer calories than he to hold her weight steady.
And here’s a really rotten possibility. Muscle weighs more than fat. This 
interesting fact is one that many people who take up exercise to lose weight
discover by accident. One month into the barbells and step-up-step-down
routine, their clothes fit better, but the scale points slightly higher because
they’ve traded fat for muscle — and you know what that means: Sometimes
you can’t win for losing. (Sorry, but I just couldn’t resist.)
Energy for work
Your second largest chunk of energy is the energy you withdraw to spend on
physical work. That’s everything from brushing your teeth in the morning to
hoeing a row of petunias in the garden or working out in the gym.
Your total energy requirement (the number of calories you need each day) is
your REE plus enough calories to cover the amount of work you do.
Does thinking about this use up energy? Yes, but not as much as you’d like to
imagine. To solve a crossword puzzle — or write a chapter of this book — the
average brain uses about 1 calorie every four minutes. That’s only one-third
the amount needed to keep a 60-watt bulb burning for the same length of
time.

Enjoying the extras
Are you a sensible foodie? If you’re supposed to have no more than 2,000
calories a day, can you pack all the vitamins, minerals, protein, heart-healthy
fats, and carbs you need into 1,800 calories? Do that, and the folks who wrote
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 (more about that in Chapter 16)
say, reward yourself. Use the “leftover” 200 calories — called discretionary
calories — for anything that makes your mouth water. Naturally, some expert
spoilsports disagree. They say that giving you an inch (those leftover calo-
ries) means you’ll take a mile (three pieces of chocolate cake). Prove them
wrong and celebrate your smarts. Yum!
How Much Should You Weigh?
Through the years, a number of charts have purported to lay out standard or
healthy weights for adult Americans, but some set the figures so low that you
can hardly get there without severely restricting your diet — or being born
again with a different body, preferably with light bones and no curves.
Studying weight charts
Table 3-4 is one moderate, eminently usable set of weight recommendations
that originally appeared in the 1990 edition of Dietary Guidelines for Americans
published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. The weights in this chart are listed in ranges for
people (men and women) of specific heights. Naturally, height is measured
without shoes, and weight is measured without clothes. (For more — much
more — on the Dietary Guidelines, see Chapter 16.)
Because most people gain some weight as they grow older, Table 3-4 does a
really sensible thing by dividing the ranges into two broad categories, one for
men and women ages 19 to 34, the other for men and women ages 35 and
older.
People with a small frame and proportionately more fat tissue than muscle
tissue (muscle is heavier than fat) are likely to weigh in at the low end.
People with a large frame and proportionately more muscle than fat are likely
to weigh in at the high end. As a general (but by no means invariable) rule,
that means that women — who have smaller frames and less muscle — weigh
less than men of the same height and age.
37
Chapter 3: Calories: The Energizers

I feel honor bound to tell you that the 2000 and 2005 editions of the Dietary
Guidelines leave out the higher weight allowances for older people, which
means that the healthy weights for everyone, young or old, are the ones
listed in the column for 19- to 34-year-olds. I’m going to go out on a limb here
to say that I prefer the 1990 recommendations because they’re
 Achievable without constant dieting
 Realistic about how your body changes as you get older
 Less likely to make you totally crazy about your weight
. . . which is a pretty good description of how nutritional guidelines need to
work, don’t you think?

Fittest and fattest U.S. cities
June is bustin’ out all over. How about you? For
several years, the guys at Men’s Fitness maga-
zine have rated the top 25 fattest and fittest cities
in the United States. Of course, Men’s Fitness is
published in Southern California, where long
legs, slim hips, tight abs, and a taste for sprouts
are handed out at birth. As a result, the maga-
zine’s pundits may not know that in other places
like, oh, New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, you-
pick-it, Americans come in all shapes and sizes.
And they may have missed the fact that running
for a bus or climbing subway stairs constitutes a
daily workout in metro areas. Or that compared
to high-fat, goat-cheese pizza, a West Coast
fave, city bagels are health food.
Nonetheless, the magazine’s lists are a warning
for the weighty. I’ll tell you right off the bat that in
2005, the 25 fittest cities (starting with the best)
were Seattle, Honolulu, Colorado Springs, San
Francisco, Denver, Portland (Oregon), Tucson,
San Diego, Albuquerque, Boston, Virginia Beach
(Virginia), Minneapolis, Fresno, Milwaukee,
Omaha, San Jose (California), Jacksonville,

Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 3rd ed. (Washington D.C.: U.S.
Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1990)
Squeezing people into neat little boxes is a reassuring exercise, but in real
life, human beings constantly confound the rules. We all know chubby people
who live long and happy lives and trim and skinny ones who leave us sooner
than they should. However, people who are overweight have a higher risk of
developing conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease, so you
need a way to find out whether your current weight puts you at risk.
39
Chapter 3: Calories: The Energizers

One good guide is the Body Mass Index (BMI), a number that measures the
relationship between your weight and your height and offers some predictive
estimate of your risk of weight-related disease.
The Body Mass Index (BMI) provides a second way to determine who’s tip-
ping the scales. In the United States, a BMI below 18.5 is currently considered
underweight, 18.5–24.9 is normal, 25.0–29.9 is overweight, and 30.0 and
higher is obese. Other countries have slightly different standards. For exam-
ple, in Australia, a BMI below 19 is underweight, 20–25 is normal, 26–30 is
overweight, and 31+ is obese. In Canada, a BMI below 18.5 is underweight,
18.5–24.9 is normal, 25–29.9 is overweight, 30–34.9 is Class 1 obese, 35–39.9 
is Class 2 obese, and 40+ is Class 3 obese. In Great Britain, a BMI below 20 is
underweight, 20–25 is normal, 25–30 is overweight, and 30+ is obese.
To calculate your BMI, perform the following steps:
1. Divide your weight (in pounds) by your height (in inches) squared.
2. Multiply the result of Step 1 by 705.
For example, if you are 5'3" (63 inches) tall and weigh 138 pounds, the equa-
tions for your BMI look like this:
BMI=
× 705 = 24.5 
Currently, the healthiest BMI seems to be 21.0. A BMI higher than 28 (168
pounds for a 5'5" woman; 195 pounds for a 5'10" man) appears to double the
risk of diabetes, heart disease, and death.
40
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 
What do they mean when they say that you’re fat?
Obesity is a specific medical condition in which
the body accumulates an overabundance of
fatty tissue. One way American nutritionists
determine who’s obese is by comparing a
person’s weight with the figures on the
weight/height charts (see Table 3-4):
 If your weight is 20 to 40 percent higher than
the chart recommends, you’re mildly obese.
 If your weight is 40 to 99 percent higher,
you’re moderately obese.
 If your weight is more than double the weight
on the chart, you’re severely obese.

How reliable are the numbers? Considering
confounding variables
Weight charts and tables and numbers and stats are so plentiful that you may
think they’re totally reliable in predicting who’s healthy and who’s not. So
here’s a surprise: They aren’t.
The problem is that real people and their differences keep sneaking into the
equation. For example, the value of the Body Mass Index in predicting your
risk of illness or death appears to be tied to your age. If you’re in your 30s, 
a lower BMI is clearly linked to better health. If you’re in your 70s or older, 
no convincing evidence points to how much you weigh playing a significant
role in determining how healthy you are or how much longer you’ll live. In
between, from age 30 to age 74, the relationship between your BMI and your
health is, well, in-between — more important early on, less important later 
in life.
In other words, the simple evidence of your own eyes is true. Although
Americans sometimes seem totally obsessed with the need to lose weight,
the fact is that many larger people, even people who are clearly obese, do
live long, happy, and healthy lives. To figure out why, many nutrition scien-
tists now are focusing not only on weight or weight/height (the BMI) but on
the importance of confounding variables, which is sciencespeak for “some-
thing else is going on here.”
Here are three potential confounding variables in the obesity/health 
equation:
 Maybe people who are overweight are more prone to illness because
they exercise less, in which case stepping up the workouts may reduce
the perceived risk of being overweight.
 People who are overweight may be more likely to be sick because they
eat lots of foods containing high-calorie ingredients, such as saturated
fat, that can trigger adverse health effects; in this case, the remedy may
simply be a change in diet.
 Maybe people who are overweight have a genetic predisposition to a
serious disease. If that’s true, you’d have to ask whether losing 20
pounds really reduces their risk of disease to the level of a person who
is naturally 20 pounds lighter. Perhaps not: In a few studies, people who
successfully lost weight actually had a higher rate of death.
41
Chapter 3: Calories: The Energizers

Adding to the confusion is the fact that an obsessive attempt to lose weight
may itself be hazardous to your health (see Chapter 14). Every year,
Americans spend $30 billion to $50 billion (yes, you read that right) on diet
clubs, special foods, and over-the-counter remedies aimed at weight loss.
Often the diets, the pills, and the foods don’t work, which can leave dieters
feeling worse than they did before they started.
The chance that the diet fails is only half the bad news. Here’s the rest: Some
foods that effectively lower calorie intake and some drugs that effectively
reduce appetite have potentially serious side effects. For example, some 
fat substitutes prevent your body from absorbing important nutrients (see
Chapter 19), and some prescription diet drugs, such as the combination 
once known as Phen-Fen, are linked to serious, even fatal, diseases.
Facing the numbers when 
they don’t fit your body
Right about here, you probably feel the strong need for a really big chocolate
bar (not such a bad idea now that nutritionists have discovered that dark
chocolate is rich in disease-fighting antioxidants). But it also makes sense to
consider the alternative: realistic rules that enable you to control your weight
safely and effectively. Check out the following:
 Rule No. 1: Not everybody starts out with the same set of genes — or
fits into the same pair of jeans. Some people are naturally larger and
heavier than others. If that’s you, and all your vital stats satisfy your
doctor, don’t waste time trying to fit someone else’s idea of perfection.
Relax and enjoy your own body.
 Rule No. 2: If you’re overweight and your doctor agrees with your
decision to diet, you don’t have to set world records to improve your
health. Even a moderate drop in poundage can be highly beneficial.
According to The New England Journal of Medicine (www.nejm.org on
the Net), losing just 10 to 15 percent of your body weight can lower high
blood sugar, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure, reducing your
risks of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
 Rule No. 3: The only number you really need to remember is 3,500,
the number of calories it takes to gain or lose one pound of body fat.
In other words, one pound of body fat equals 3,500 calories. So if you
simply
• Cut your calorie consumption from 2,000 calories a day to 1,700
and continue to do the same amount of physical work, you’ll lose
one pound of fat in just 12 days.
42
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

• Go the other way, increasing from 1,700 to 2,000 calories a day
without increasing the amount of work you do, 12 days later you’ll
be one pound heavier.
 Rule No. 4: Moderation is the best path to weight control. Moderate
calorie deprivation on a sensible diet produces healthful, moderate
weight loss; this diet includes a wide variety of different foods contain-
ing sufficient amounts of essential nutrients. Abusing this rule and cut-
ting calories to the bone can turn you literally into skin and bones,
depriving you of the nutrients you need to live a normal healthy life. For
more on the potentially devastating effects of starvation, voluntary and
otherwise, check out Chapter 14.
 Rule No. 5: Be more active. Doing exercise allows you to take in more
calories and still lose weight. In addition, exercise reduces the risk of
many health problems, such as heart disease. Sounds like a recipe for
success.
How many calories do you really need?
Figuring out ex-act-ly how many calories to consume each day can be a, well,
consuming task. Luckily, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 lays out a
list of the average daily calorie allowance for healthy adults with a healthful
BMI — 21.5 for women and 22.5 for men — based on the amount of activity a
person performs each day. Table 3-5 shows numbers. Note that in this con-
text, sedentary means a lifestyle with only the light physical activity associ-
ated with daily living; moderately active means a lifestyle that adds physical
activity equal to a daily 1.5–3 mile walks at a speed of 3–4 miles per hour;
active means adding physical activity equal to walking 3 miles a day at the
3–4 mph clip.

The last word on calories
Calories are not your enemy. On the contrary, they give you the energy you
need to live a healthy life.
The trick is managing your calories and not letting them manage you. After
you know that fats are more fattening than proteins and carbohydrates and
that your body burns food to make energy, you can strategize your energy
intake to match your energy expenditure, and vice versa. Here’s how: Turn
straight to Chapter 16 to find out about a healthful diet and Chapter 17 to find

How Much Nutrition 
Do You Need?
In This Chapter
 Unveiling what the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are
 Comparing differences between RDAs and Adequate Intakes (AIs)
 Looking at nutrition a new way: The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI)
 Discovering how who you are determines the amount of nutrients you need
A
healthful diet provides sufficient amounts of all the nutrients that your
body needs. The question is, how much is enough?
Today, three sets of recommendations provide the answers, and each comes
with its own virtues and deficiencies. The first, and most familiar, is the RDA
(short for Recommended Dietary Allowance). The second, originally known as
the Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDIs), now short-
ened to Adequate Intake or simply AI, describes recommended amounts of
nutrients for which no RDAs exist. The third is the DRI (Dietary Reference
Intake), an umbrella term that includes RDAs plus several innovative cate-
gories of nutrient recommendations.
Confused? Not to worry. This chapter spells it all out.
RDAs: Guidelines for Good Nutrition
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) were created in 1941 by the
Food and Nutrition Board, a subsidiary of the National Research Council,
which is part of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.

RDAs originally were designed to make planning several days’ meals in
advance easy for you. The D in RDA stands for dietary, not daily, because the
RDAs are an average. You may get more of a nutrient one day and less the
next, but the idea is to hit an average over several days.
For example, the current RDA for vitamin C is 75 mg for a woman and 90 mg
for a man (age 18 and older). One 8-ounce glass of fresh orange juice has 
120 mg vitamin C, so a woman can have an 8-ounce glass of orange juice 
on Monday and Tuesday, skip Wednesday, and still meet the RDA for the
three days. A man may have to toss in something else — maybe a stalk of
broccoli — to be able to do the same thing. No big deal.
The amounts recommended by the RDAs provide a margin of safety for
healthy people, but they’re not therapeutic. In other words, RDA servings
won’t cure a nutrient deficiency, but they can prevent one from occurring.
The essentials
RDAs offer recommendations for protein and 18 essential vitamins and miner-
als, which include:
 Vitamin A
 Folate
 Vitamin D
 Vitamin B12
 Vitamin E
 Phosphorus
 Vitamin K
 Magnesium
 Vitamin C
 Iron
 Thiamin (vitamin B1)
 Zinc
 Riboflavin (vitamin B2)
 Copper
 Niacin
 Iodine
 Vitamin B6
 Selenium
The newest essential nutrient, choline, won its wings in 2002, but no RDAs
have yet been established. Calcium also has an Adequate Intake (AI) rather
than an RDA.
Recommendations for carbohydrates, 
fats, dietary fiber, and alcohol
What nutrients are missing from the RDA list of essentials? Carbohydrates,
fiber, fat, and alcohol. The reason is simple: If your diet provides enough 
46
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

protein, vitamins, and minerals, it’s almost certain to provide enough carbo-
hydrates and probably more than enough fat. Although no specific RDAs
exist for carbohydrates and fat, guidelines definitely exist for them and for
dietary fiber and alcohol.
In 1980, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
joined forces to produce the first edition of Dietary Guidelines for Americans
(see Chapter 16). This report has been modified many times. The latest set of
recommendations, issued in the spring of 2005, sets parameters for what you
can consider reasonable amounts of calories, carbohydrates, dietary fiber,
fats, protein, and alcohol. According to these guidelines, as a general rule,
you need to
 Balance your calorie intake with energy output in the form of regular
exercise. Check out Chapter 3 for specifics on how many calories a
person of your weight, height, and level of activity (couch potato?
marathon runner?) needs to consume each day.
 Eat enough carbohydrates (primarily the complex ones from fruits, veg-
etables, and whole grains) to account for 45 to 65 percent of your total
daily calories. That’s 900 to 1,300 calories on a 2,000-calorie diet.
 Take in an appropriate amount of dietary fiber, currently described as 14
grams dietary fiber for every 1,000 calories.
 Get no more than 20 to 35 percent of your daily calories from dietary fat.
Therefore, if your daily diet includes about 2,000 calories, only 400 to
700 calories should come from fat.
Less than 10 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated
fatty acids, and your daily diet should have less than 300 mg cholesterol.
Eat as little trans fat as possible. The Nutrition Facts label on foods now
shows a gram amount for trans fats, but there’s no upper limit because
any amount is considered, well, less than okey-dokey. (For the skinny on
saturated, unsaturated, and trans fats, plus cholesterol, check out
Chapter 7).
 If you choose to drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation, mean-
ing one drink a day for a woman and two for a man.
Different people, different needs
Because different bodies require different amounts of nutrients, RDAs cur-
rently address as many as 22 specific categories of human beings: boys and
girls, men and women, from infancy through middle age. The RDAs recently
were expanded to include recommendations for groups of people ages 50 to
47
Chapter 4: How Much Nutrition Do You Need?

70 and 70 and older. Eventually, recommendations will be made for people
older than 85. These expanded groupings are a really good idea. In 1990, the
U.S. Census counted 31.1 million Americans who are older than 65. By 2050,
the U.S. Government expects more than 60 million to be alive and kickin’. You
wouldn’t want these baby boomers to miss their RDAs, now would you?
But who you are affects the recommendations. If age is important, so is
gender. For example, because women of childbearing age lose iron when they
menstruate, their RDA for iron is higher than the RDA for men. On the other
hand, because men who are sexually active lose zinc through their ejacula-
tions, the zinc RDA for men is higher than the zinc RDA for women.
Finally, gender affects body composition, which influences RDAs. Consider
protein: The RDA for protein is set in terms of grams of protein per kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of body weight. Because the average man weighs more than the
average woman, his RDA for protein is higher than hers. The RDA for an adult
male, age 19 or older, is 56 grams; for a woman, it’s 46 grams.
AIs: The Nutritional Numbers Formerly
Known as ESADDIs
In addition to the RDAs, the Food and Nutrition Board created Estimated Safe
and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI), now renamed Adequate Intake
(AI), for eight nutrients considered necessary for good health, even though
nobody really knows exactly how much your body needs. Not to worry:
Sooner or later some smart nutrition researcher will come up with a hard
number and move the nutrient to the RDA list. Or not. In the meantime, 
new reports have established AIs for various age groups for the following
nutrients:
 Pantothenic acid
 Molybdenum
 Biotin
 Manganese
 Choline
 Fluoride
 Calcium
 Chromium
DRI: A Newer Nutrition Guide
In 1993, the Food and Nutrition Board’s Dietary Reference Intakes committee
established several panels of experts to review the RDAs and other recom-
mendations for major nutrients (vitamins, minerals, and other food compo-
nents) in light of new research and nutrition information.
48
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

The first order of business was to establish a new standard for nutrient rec-
ommendations called the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). DRI is an umbrella
term that embraces several categories of nutritional measurements for vita-
mins, minerals, and other nutrients. It includes the:
 Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): the amount that meets the
nutritional needs of half the people in any one group (such as teenage
girls or people older than 70). Nutritionists use the EAR to figure out
whether an entire population’s normal diet provides adequate amounts
of nutrients.
 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The RDA, now based on 
information provided by the EAR, is still a daily average for individuals,
the amount of any one nutrient known to protect against deficiency.
 Adequate Intake (AI): The AI is a new measurement, providing recom-
mendations for nutrients for which no RDA is set. (Note: AI replaces
ESADDI.)
 Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): The UL is the highest amount of a
nutrient you can consume each day without risking an adverse effect.
The DRI panel’s first report, listing new recommendations for calcium, phos-
phorus, magnesium, and fluoride, appeared in 1997. Its most notable change
was upping the recommended amount of calcium from 800 mg to 1,000 mg for
adults ages 31 to 50 as well as post-menopausal women taking estrogen sup-
plements; for post menopausal women not taking estrogen, the recommenda-
tion is 1,500 mg.
The second DRI Panel report appeared in 1998. The report included new 
recommendations for thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin
B12, pantothenic acid, biotin, and choline. The most important revision was
increasing the folate recommendation to 400 mcg a day based on evidence
showing that folate reduces a woman’s risk of giving birth to a baby with
spinal cord defects and lowers the risk of heart disease for men and women.
(See the sidebar “Reviewing terms to describe nutrient recommendations” in
this chapter or the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book to brush up on your
metric abbreviations.)
As a result of the 1989 DRI Panel report, the FDA ordered food manufac-
turers to add folate to flour, rice, and other grain products. (Multivitamin
products already contain 400 mcg of folate.) In May 1999, data released by
the Framingham Heart Study, which has followed heart health among resi-
dents of a Boston suburb for nearly half a century, showed a dramatic
increase in blood levels of folate. Before the fortification of foods, 22 percent
of the study participants had folate deficiencies; after the fortification, the
number fell to 2 percent.
49
Chapter 4: How Much Nutrition Do You Need?

A DRI report with revised recommendations for vitamin C, vitamin E, the min-
eral selenium, beta-carotene, and other antioxidant vitamins was published in
2000. In 2001, new DRIs were released for vitamin A, vitamin K, arsenic, boron,
chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon,
vanadium, and zinc. And in 2004, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released new
recommendations for sodium, potassium, chloride, and water, plus a special
report on recommendations for two groups of older adults (ages 50 to 70 and
71 and over). Put these findings all together, and they spell out the recommen-
dations you find in this chapter.
Table 4-1 shows the most recent RDAs for vitamins for healthy adults; Table
4-2 shows RDAs for minerals for healthy adults. Where no RDA is given, an AI
is indicated by an asterisk (*) by the column heading. The complete reports
on which this table is based are available online. Go to www.iom.edu/
Object.File/Master/21/372/0.pdf. Prefer hard copy? IOM plans to
consolidate the reports into one book to be published late in 2006. (If you
want an idea of what kinds of foods provide these vitamins, check out
Chapter 10.)

Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 
Reviewing terms used to describe 
nutrient recommendations
Nutrient listings use the metric system. RDAs for
protein are listed in grams. The RDA and AIs for
vitamins and minerals are shown in milligrams
(mg) and micrograms (mcg). A milligram is 1⁄1000
of a gram; a microgram is 1⁄1000 of a milligram.
Vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E are special
cases. For instance, one form of vitamin A is pre-
formed vitamin A, a form of the nutrient that your
body can use right away. Preformed vitamin A,
known as retinol,is found in food from animals —
liver, milk, and eggs. Carotenoids (red or yellow
pigments in plants) also provide vitamin A. But to
get vitamin A from carotenoids, your body has to
convert the pigments to chemicals similar to
retinol. Because retinol is a ready-made nutrient,
the RDA for vitamin A is listed in units called
retinol equivalents (RE). One mcg (microgram) 
RE is approximately equal to 3.33 international
units (IU, the former unit of measurement for 
vitamin A).
Vitamin D consists of three compounds: vitamin
D1, vitamin D2, and vitamin D3. Cholecalciferol,
the chemical name for vitamin D3, is the most
active of the three, so the RDA for vitamin D is
measured in equivalents of cholecalciferol.
Your body gets vitamin E from two classes of
chemicals in food: tocopherols and tocotrienols.
The compound with the greatest vitamin E activ-
ity is a tocopherol: alpha-tocopherol. The RDA
for vitamin E is measured in milligrams of alpha-
tocopherol equivalents (a-TE).

No Sale Ever Is Final
The slogan “No Sale Ever Is Final,” printed on the sales slips at one of my
favorite clothing stores, definitely applies to nutritional numbers. RDAs, AIs,
and DRIs should always be regarded as works in progress, subject to revision
at the first sign of a new study. In other words, in an ever-changing world,
here’s one thing of which you can be absolutely certain: The numbers in this
chapter will change. Sorry about that.

Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

Chapter 5
A Supplemental Story
In This Chapter
 Assessing the value of dietary supplements
 Finding out who regulates dietary supplements
 Making wise choices about supplements
 Getting your nutrients from food
T
he Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that every year,
Americans buy millions of bottles and boxes of dietary supplements, a
$19 billion business that includes everything from plain old vitamin C to —
yuck! — desiccated (dried) liver. You can stir up a good food fight in any
group of nutrition experts simply by asking whether all these supplements
are (a) necessary, (b) economical, or (c) safe. But when the argument’s over,
you still may not have a satisfactory official answer, so this brief chapter aims
to provide the information you need to make your own sensible choices.
Introducing Dietary Supplements
The vitamin pill you may pop each morning is a dietary supplement. So are
the calcium antacids many American women consider standard nutrition.
Echinacea, the herb reputed to short-circuit your winter cold, is, and so is the
vanilla-flavored meal-in-a-can liquid your granny chug-a-lugs every afternoon
just before setting off on her daily mile power walk. The FDA classifies each
of these as a dietary supplement because they meet the agency’s definition:
any pill, tablet, capsule, powder, or liquid you take by mouth that contains a
dietary ingredient.
Of course, that raises another question: What’s a dietary ingredient? Answer:
 Vitamins
 Minerals

 Herbs
 Amino acids (the “building blocks of protein” described in Chapter 6)
 Enzymes
 Organ tissue, such as desiccated (dried) liver
 Some hormones, such as melatonin, which is promoted as a sleep aid
 Metabolites (substances produced when nutrients are digested)
 Extracts
Dietary supplements may be single-ingredient products, such as vitamin E
capsules, or they may be combination products, such as the nutrient-packed
protein powders favored by some athletes.
Examining Why People Use 
Dietary Supplements
In a country where food is plentiful and affordable, you have to wonder why
so many people opt to scarf down pills instead of just plain food.
Many people consider vitamin and mineral supplements a quick and easy
way to get nutrients without so much shopping and kitchen time and without
all the pesky fat and sugars in food. Others take supplements as nutritional
insurance (for more on recommended dietary allowances of vitamins and
minerals, see Chapter 4). And some even use supplements as substitutes for
medical drugs. In general, nutrition experts, including the American Dietetic
Association, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Research
Council, prefer that you invest your time and money whipping up meals and
snacks that supply the nutrients you need in a balanced, tasty diet. Nonethe-
less, every expert worth his or her vitamin C admits that in certain circum-
stances, supplements can be a definite plus.
In 2002, the American Medical Association (AMA), which for decades had
turned thumbs down on vitamin supplements, changed its collective mind
after a review of 26 years’ worth of scientific studies relating vitamin levels to
the risk of chronic illness. Robert H. Fletcher and Kathleen M. Fairfield, the
Harvard-based authors of the study, which was published in the Journal of
the American Medical Association (JAMA), said, yes, true vitamin-deficiency
diseases such as scurvy and beriberi are rare in Western countries. But sub-
optimal vitamin levels — sciencespeak for slightly less than you need — are a
real problem. If “slightly less than you need” sounds slightly less than impor-
tant, consider this:
56
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

 Suboptimal intake of folate and two other B vitamins (B6 and B12) raises
your risk of heart disease, colon cancer, breast cancer, and birth defects.
 Suboptimal vitamin D intake means a higher risk of rickets and 
osteoporosis.
 Suboptimal levels of antioxidant vitamins A, E, and C are linked to a par-
ticular form of heart disease and some forms of cancer.
Hence the new AMA rule: “It’s prudent for all adults to take vitamin 
supplements.”
But just as that bit of info was settling in, a new study (you can read more
about this in Chapter 10) said, “Hold it! There’s too much Vitamin A in that
pill!” That was followed by more new research on too much vitamin E. As you
read this, vitamin manufacturers are tumbling over each other in the race to
get new, lower formulations to market.
When food isn’t enough
Illness, age, diet preferences, and some gender-related conditions may put
you in a spot where you can’t get all the nutrients you need from food alone.
Digestive illnesses, unfriendly drugs, injury, and chronic illness
Certain metabolic disorders and diseases of the digestive organs (liver, gall-
bladder, pancreas, and intestines) interfere with the normal digestion of food
and the absorption of nutrients. Some medicines may also interfere with
normal digestion, meaning you need supplements to make up the difference.
People who suffer from certain chronic diseases, who have suffered a major
injury (such as a serious burn), or who have just been through surgery may
need more nutrients than they can get from food. In these cases, a doctor
may prescribe supplements to provide the hard-to-get vitamins, minerals,
and other nutrients.
Checking with your doctor or pharmacist before opting for a supplement you
hope will have medical effects (make you stronger, smooth your skin, ease
your anxiety) is a smart idea. The bad old days when doctors were total igno-
ramuses about nutrition may not be gone forever, but they’re fading fast.
Besides, your doctor is the person most familiar with your health, knows
what medications you’re taking, and can warn you of potential side effects.
Vegetarianism
Vitamin B12 is found only in food from animals, such as meat, milk, and eggs.
(Some seaweed does have B12, but the suspicion is that the vitamin comes
57
Chapter 5: A Supplemental Story

from microorganisms living in the plant.) Without these foods, vegans — 
vegetarians who don’t eat any foods of animal origin — almost certainly have
to get their vitamin B12 from supplements or fortified foods.
Using supplements as insurance
Healthy people who eat a nutritious diet still may want to use supplements to
make sure they’re getting adequate nutrition. Plenty of recent research sup-
ports their choice.
Protecting against disease
Taking supplements may reduce the likelihood of some types of cancer and
other diseases. After analyzing data from a survey of 871 men and women, epi-
demiologists at Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center found that people
taking a daily multivitamin for more than ten years were 50 percent less likely
to develop colon cancer. In addition, selenium supplements seem to reduce
the risk of prostate cancer, and vitamin C seems to lower the risk of cataracts.
Supplementing aging appetites
As you grow older, your appetite may decline and your sense of taste and
smell may falter. If food no longer tastes as good as it once did, if you have to
eat alone all the time and don’t enjoy cooking for one, or if dentures make
chewing difficult, you may not be taking in all the foods that you need to get
the nutrients you require. Dietary supplements to the rescue!
If you’re so rushed that you literally never get to eat a full, balanced meal,
you may benefit from supplements regardless of your age.
Meeting a woman’s special needs
And what about women? At various stages of their reproductive lives, they,
too, benefit from supplements-as-insurance:
 Before menopause: Women, who lose iron each month through menstrual
bleeding, rarely get sufficient amounts of iron from a typical American diet
providing fewer than 2,000 calories a day. For them, and for women who
are often on a diet to lose weight, iron supplements may be the only prac-
tical answer.
Iron is a mineral element, so it may be called “iron” or “elemental iron”
on the label. Iron pills contain a compound of elemental iron (“ferrous”
or “ferric,” from ferrum, the Latin word for iron), plus an ingredient such
as a sulfur derivative or lactic acid to enable your body to use the iron.
On the label, the combination reads “ferrous sulfate” or “ferrous lactate.”
Different iron compounds dissolve at different rates in your stomach,
58
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 

yielding different amounts of elemental iron, so supplement labels usu-
ally list the iron this way: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg/Elemental iron 65 mg.
Translation? This pill has 325 milligrams of ferrous sulfate, yielding 65
milligrams plain old iron. Sometimes the label omits the first part and
simply says: Iron 65 mg.
If your doctor says, “Take one 325-milligram pill a day,” she means 325
milligrams iron compound, not plain elemental iron.
 During pregnancy and lactation: Women who are pregnant or nursing
often need supplements to provide the nutrients they need to build new
maternal and fetal tissue or to produce nutritious breast milk. In addi-
tion, supplements of the B vitamin folate now are known to decrease a
woman’s risk of giving birth to a child with a neural tube defect (a defect
of the spinal cord and column).
Never self-prescribe supplements while you’re pregnant. Large amounts
of some nutrients may actually be hazardous for your baby. For exam-
ple, taking megadoses of vitamin A while you’re pregnant can increase
the risk of birth defects.
 Through adulthood: True, women older than 19 can get the calcium
they require (1,000 milligrams/day) from four 8-ounce glasses of nonfat
skim milk a day, three 8-ounce containers of yogurt made with nonfat
milk, 22 ounces of canned salmon (with the soft edible bones; no, you
definitely should not eat the hard bones in fresh salmon!), or any combi-
nation of the above. However, expecting women to do this nutritional
balancing act every single day may be unrealistic. The simple alternative
is calcium supplements.
Supplement Safety: An Iffy Proposition
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food and drugs (no sur-
prise there). Before the agency allows a new food or a new drug on the
market, the manufacturer must submit proof that the product is safe. Drug
manufacturers must also meet a second test, showing that their new medi-
cine is efficacious, a fancy way of saying that the drug and the dosage in
which it’s sold will cure or relieve the condition for which it’s prescribed.
Nobody says the drug-regulation system’s perfect. Reality dictates that manu-
facturers test a drug only on a limited number of people for a limited period
of time. So you can bet that some new drugs will trigger unexpected, serious,
maybe even life-threatening side effects when used by thousands of people or
taken for longer than the testing period. For proof, look no further than Phen-
Fen, a diet drug combination that appeared to control weight safely during
premarket testing but turned lethal after it reached pharmacy shelves.

But at least the FDA can require that premarket safety and/or effectiveness
info be displayed on foods and drugs. Unfortunately, the agency has no such
power when it comes to dietary supplements.
In 1994, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act, which limits the FDA’s control over
dietary supplements. Under this law, The FDA can’t
 Require premarket tests to prove that supplements are safe and effective
 Limit the dosage in any dietary supplement
 Halt or restrict sales of a dietary supplement unless evidence shows that
the product has caused illness or injury when used according to the direc-
tions on the package; in other words, if you experience a problem after
taking slightly more or less of a supplement than directed on the label,
the FDA can’t help you
As a result, the FDA has found it virtually impossible to take products off
drugstore shelves even after reports of illness and injury. For example, sup-
plements containing the herb ephedra are reputed to enhance weight loss
and sports performance. More than 600 reports of illness and at least 100
deaths have been linked to the use of ephedra supplements. The herb is
banned by professional football and college athletics in the U.S. and by the
Olympics. However, the FDA didn’t act until February 2003, following the
death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler, who reportedly had been
using ephedra products to control his weight.
Bechler’s untimely death rang warning bells across the country, including in
Washington, D.C., where the FDA ruled that henceforth every bottle of ephedra
must carry strong warnings that the popular herb can cause potentially lethal
heart attacks or strokes. In the sports world, ephedra was immediately for-
bidden in minor league but not major league baseball. The FDA banned all

Sweet trouble
Nobody wants to choke down a yucky supple-
ment, but pills that look or taste like candy may
be hazardous to a child’s health. Some nutrients
are troublesome — or even deadly — in high
doses (see Chapters 10 and 11), especially for
kids. For example, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration warns the lethal dose for young children
may be as low as 3 grams (3,000 milligrams) 
elemental iron, the amount in 49 tablets with 65
milligrams iron apiece. If you have youngsters
in your house, protect them by buying neutral-
tasting supplements and keeping all pills, nutri-
ent and otherwise, in a safe cabinet, preferably
high off the floor and locked tight to resist tiny
prying fingers.

ephedra products, but the ban was partially reversed in April 2005, when a
federal judge ruled that products containing low doses of ephedra were safe
and could remain on the market. Some in Congress are pressing for a law that
would enable FDA to ban any supplements considered even potentially haz-
ardous to your precious health. Stay tuned.
By the way, ephedra isn’t the only herbal supplement that can make you
really uncomfortable. Table 5-1 lists some equally problematic herbal prod-
ucts that you need to approach with caution — or avoid altogether. In many
cases, even small amounts are hazardous.

Choosing the Most Effective Supplements
Okay, you’ve read about the virtues and drawbacks of supplements. You’ve
decided which supplements you think may do you some good. Now it’s
crunch time, and all you really want to know is how to choose the safest,
most effective products. The guidelines in this section can help.
61
Chapter 5: A Supplemental Story

Choosing a well-known brand
Even though the FDA can’t require manufacturers to submit safety and effective-
ness data, a respected name on the label offers some assurance of a quality
product. It also promises a fresh product; well-known brands generally sell out
more quickly. The initials USP (U.S. Pharmacopoeia, a reputable testing organi-
zation) are another quality statement, and so are the words “release assured” or
“proven release,” which mean the supplement is easily absorbed by your body.
Checking the ingredient list
Check the supplement label. In the early 1990s, the FDA introduced the con-
sumer-friendly nutrition food label with its mini-nutrition guide to nutrient
content, complete ingredient listings, and dependable information about how
eating certain foods may affect your risk of chronic illnesses, such as heart
disease and cancer. (For more about the nutrition labels, see Chapter 17.)
The FDA’s new supplement labels must list all ingredients. The label for vita-
min and mineral products must give you the quantity per nutrient per serv-
ing plus the %DV (percentage daily value), the percentage of the RDA
(Recommended Dietary Allowance). The listings for other dietary supple-
ments, such as botanicals (herbs) and phytochemicals (see Chapter 12),
must show the quantity per serving plus the part of the plant from which the
ingredient is drawn (root, leaves, and so on). A manufacturer’s own propri-
etary blend of two or more botanicals must list the weight of the total blend.
Figure 5-1 shows an example of the new supplement labels.
Looking for the expiration date
Over time, all dietary supplements become less potent. Always choose the
product with the longest useful shelf life. Pass on the ones that will expire
before you can use all the pills, such as the 100-pill bottle with an expiration
date 30 days from now.
Checking the storage requirements
Even when you buy a product with the correct expiration date, it may be less
effective if you don’t keep it in the right place. Some supplements must be
refrigerated; the rest you need to store, like any food product, in a cool, dry
place. Avoid putting dietary supplements in a cabinet above the stove or
refrigerator — true, the fridge is cold inside, but the motor pulsing away out-
side emits heat.

Chapter 5: A Supplemental Story

Choosing a sensible dose
Unless your doctor prescribes a dietary supplement as medicine, you don’t
need products marked “therapeutic,” “extra-strength,” or any variation
thereof. Pick one that gives you no more than the RDA for any ingredient.
Avoiding hype
When the label promises something that’s too good to be true — “Buy me!
You’ll live forever” — you know it’s too good to be true. The FDA doesn’t
permit supplement marketers to claim that their products cure or prevent dis-
ease (that would make them medicines that require premarket testing). But
the agency does allow claims that affect function, such as “maintains your
cholesterol” (the no-no medical claim would be “lowers your cholesterol”).
Another potential hype zone is the one labeled “natural,” as in “natural vita-
mins are better.” If you took Chem 101 in college, you know that the ascorbic
acid (vitamin C) in oranges has exactly the same chemical composition as the
ascorbic acid some nutritional chemist cooks up in her lab. But the ascorbic
acid in a “natural” vitamin pill may come without additives such as coloring
agents or fillers used in “regular” vitamin pills. In other words, if you aren’t
sensitive to the coloring agents or fillers in plain old pills, don’t spend the
extra dollars for “natural.” If you are sensitive, do. What could be simpler?
(For more on “natural” versus “synthetic” food ingredients, see Chapter 22.)
Good Reasons for Getting Nutrients from
Food Rather Than Supplements
Despite this chapter’s focus on the wonders of supplements, I feel obligated to
play devil’s advocate and report to you the arguments in favor of healthy people
getting all or most of their nutrients from food rather than supplements.
64
Part I: The Basic Facts about Nutrition 
Nutrients for the 21st-century body
Hate taking pills? Bored with trying to get all 
the foods required to meet your nutrients
needs? A vitamin company in New South Wales
(New Zealand) has your back. Or should I 
say, your bottom? AussieBum “Essence” under-
wear is made with material impregnated with
“micro-encapsulated organic substances” that
stay functional for up to 15 washings, releasing
antioxidant “dermo-protective oils” onto your
skin. And I just found them on, yes, eBay! You
can’t make this stuff up.

Cost
If you’re willing to plan and prepare nutritious meals, you can almost always
get your nutrients less expensively from fresh fruits, vegetables, whole
grains, dairy products, meat, fish, and poultry. Besides, food usually tastes
better than supplements.
Unexpected bonuses
Food is a package deal containing vitamins, minerals, protein, fat, carbohy-
drates, and fiber, plus a cornucopia of as-yet-unidentified substances called
phytochemicals (phyto = plant, chemicals = well, chemicals) that may be vital
to your continuing good health. Think of lycopene, the red pigment in toma-
toes that recently was found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Think of
genistein and daidzein, the estrogen-like substances in soybeans that appear
to reduce your risk of heart disease. Who knows what else is hiding in your
apples, peaches, pears, and plums? Do you want to be the only one on your
block who misses out on these goodies? Of course not. For more about the
benefits of phytochemicals, see Chapter 12.
Safety
Several common nutrients may be toxic when you scarf them down in mega-
dose servings (amounts several times larger than the RDAs). Not only are
large doses of vitamin A linked to birth defects, but they may also cause symp-
toms similar to a brain tumor. Niacin megadoses may cause liver damage.
Megadoses of vitamin B6 may cause (temporary) damage to nerves in arms,
legs, fingers, and toes. All these effects are more likely to occur with supple-
ments. Pills slip down easily, but regardless of how hungry you are, you proba-
bly won’t eat enough food to reach toxic levels of nutrients. (To read more
about the hazards of megadoses, see Chapters 10 and 11.)
The best statement about the role of supplements in good nutrition may be a
paraphrase of Abraham Lincoln’s famous remark about politicians and voters:
“You may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the
people all the time; but you can’t fool all of the people all the time.” If Honest
Abe were with us now and were a sensible nutritionist rather than President,
he might amend his words: “Supplements are valuable for all people some of
the time and for some people all the time, but they’re probably not necessary
for all people all the time.”

ere’s the lowdown on things you’ve heard about
practically forever: protein, fat, carbohydrates, alco-
hol, vitamins, minerals, and water, with the absolutely
newest numbers available on how much of what nutrients
you need to keep your body humming happily.
This is a For Dummies book, so you don’t have to read

P
rotein is an essential nutrient whose name comes from the Greek word
protos, which means “first.” To visualize a molecule of protein, close
your eyes and see a very long chain, rather like a chain of sausage links. The
links in the chains are amino acids, commonly known as the building blocks
of protein. In addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, amino acids
contain a nitrogen (amino) group. The amino group is essential for synthesiz-
ing (assembling) specialized proteins in your body.
In this chapter, you can find out more — maybe even more than you ever
wanted to know — about this molecule, how your body uses the proteins you
take in as food, and how the body makes some special proteins you need for
a healthy life.
Looking Inside and Out: Where 
Your Body Puts Protein
The human body is chock-full of proteins. Proteins are present in the outer
and inner membranes of every living cell. Here’s where else protein makes an
appearance:
 Your hair, your nails, and the outer layers of your skin are made of the
protein keratin. Keratin is a scleroprotein, or a protein resistant to diges-
tive enzymes. So if you bite your nails, you can’t digest them.
 Muscle tissue contains myosin, actin, myoglobin, and a number of other
proteins.

 Bone has plenty of protein. The outer part of bone is hardened with 
minerals such as calcium, but the basic, rubbery inner structure is pro-
tein; and bone marrow, the soft material inside the bone, also contains
protein.
 Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein compound that carries
oxygen throughout the body. Plasma, the clear fluid in blood, contains
fat and protein particles known as lipoproteins, which ferry cholesterol
around and out of the body.
Putting Protein to Work: How 
Your Body Uses Protein
Your body uses proteins to build new cells, maintain tissues, and synthesize
new proteins that make it possible for you to perform basic bodily functions.
About half the dietary protein that you consume each day goes into making
enzymes, the specialized worker proteins that do specific jobs such as digest-
ing food and assembling or dividing molecules to make new cells and chemi-
cal substances. To perform these functions, enzymes often need specific
vitamins and minerals.
Your ability to see, think, hear, and move — in fact, to do just about everything
that you consider part of a healthy life — requires your nerve cells to send
messages back and forth to each other and to other specialized kinds of cells,
such as muscle cells. Sending these messages requires chemicals called neuro-
transmitters. Making neurotransmitters requires — guess what — proteins.
Finally, proteins play an important part in the creation of every new cell and
every new individual. Your chromosomes consist of nucleoproteins, which are
substances made of amino acids and nucleic acids. See the “DNA/RNA” side-
bar in this chapter for more information about nucleoproteins.
Packing Back the Protein: What
Happens to the Proteins You Eat
The cells in your digestive tract can absorb only single amino acids or very
small chains of two or three amino acids called peptides. So proteins from
food are broken into their component amino acids by digestive enzymes —
which are, of course, specialized proteins. Then other enzymes in your body
cells build new proteins by reassembling the amino acids into specific com-
pounds that your body needs to function. This process is called protein syn-
thesis. During protein synthesis
70
Part II: What You Get from Food 

 Amino acids hook up with fats to form lipoproteins, the molecules that
ferry cholesterol around and out of the body. Or amino acids may join
up with carbohydrates to form the glycoproteins found in the mucus
secreted by the digestive tract.
 Proteins combine with phosphoric acid to produce phosphoproteins,
such as casein, a protein in milk.
 Nucleic acids combine with proteins to create nucleoproteins, which are
essential components of the cell nucleus and of cytoplasm, the living
material inside each cell.
The carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen that are left over after protein synthesis is
complete are converted to glucose and used for energy (see Chapter 7). The
nitrogen residue (ammonia) isn’t used for energy. It’s processed by the liver,
which converts the ammonia to urea. Most of the urea produced in the liver
is excreted through the kidneys in urine; very small amounts are sloughed off
in skin, hair, and nails.
Every day, you turn over (reuse) more proteins than you get from the food
you eat, so you need a continuous supply to maintain your protein status. If
your diet does not contain sufficient amounts of proteins, you start digesting
the proteins in your body, including the proteins in your muscles and — in
extreme cases — your heart muscle.
71
Chapter 6: Powerful Protein
DNA/RNA
Nucleoproteins are chemicals in the nucleus of
every living cell. They’re made of proteins linked
to nucleic acids — complex compounds that
contain phosphoric acid, a sugar molecule, 
and nitrogen-containing molecules made from
amino acids.
Nucleic acids (molecules found in the chromo-
somes and other structures in the center of your
cells) carry the genetic codes — genes that
help determine what you look like, your general
intelligence, and who you are. They contain one
of two sugars, either ribose or deoxyribose. The
nucleic acid containing ribose is called ribonu-
cleic acid (RNA). The nucleic acid containing
deoxyribose is called deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA).
DNA, a long molecule with two strands twisting
about each other (the double helix), carries 
and transmits the genetic inheritance in your
chromosomes. In other words, DNA supplies
instructions that determine how your body cells
are formed and how they behave. RNA, a
single-strand molecule, is created in the cell
nucleus according to the pattern determined by
the DNA. Then RNA carries the DNA’s instruc-
tions to the rest of the cell.
Knowing about DNA is important because it’s
the most distinctly “you” thing about your body.
Chances that another person on Earth has
exactly the same DNA as you are really small.
That’s why DNA analysis is used increasingly in
identifying criminals or exonerating the inno-
cent. Some people are even proposing that par-
ents store a sample of their children’s DNA so
that they’ll have a conclusive way of identifying
a missing child, even years later.

Examining Protein Types: Not All
Proteins Are Created Equal
All proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids, but not all pro-
teins contain all the amino acids you require. This section helps you figure
out how you can get the most useful proteins from your varied diet.
Essential and nonessential proteins
To make all the proteins that your body needs, you require 22 different amino
acids. Ten are considered essential, which means you can’t synthesize them in
your body and must obtain them from food (two of these, arginine and histidine,
are essential only for children). Several more are nonessential: If you don’t get
them in food, you can manufacture them yourself from fats, carbohydrates, and
other amino acids. Three — glutamine, ornithine, and taurine — are somewhere
in between essential and nonessential for human beings: They’re essential only
under certain conditions, such as with injury or disease.

High-quality and low-quality proteins
Because an animal’s body is similar to yours, its proteins contain similar
combinations of amino acids. That’s why nutritionists call proteins from
foods of animal origin — meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products — high-
quality proteins. Your body absorbs these proteins more efficiently; they can
be used without much waste to synthesize other proteins. The proteins from
plants — grains, fruit, vegetables, legumes (beans), nuts, and seeds — often
have limited amounts of some amino acids, which means their nutritional
content is not as high as animal proteins.
73
Chapter 6: Powerful Protein
Super soy: The special protein food
Nutrition fact No. 1: Food from animals has
complete proteins. Nutrition fact No. 2: Veg-
etables, fruits, and grains have incomplete 
proteins. Nutrition fact No. 3: Nobody told the
soybean.
Unlike other vegetables, including other beans,
soybeans have complete proteins with suffi-
cient amounts of all the amino acids essential
to human health. In fact, food experts rank soy
proteins on par with egg whites and casein (the
protein in milk), the two proteins easiest for your
body to absorb and use (see Table 6-1).
Some nutritionists think soy proteins are even
better than the proteins in eggs and milk,
because the proteins in soy come with no cho-
lesterol and very little of the saturated fat known
to clog your arteries and raise your risk of heart
attack. Better yet, more than 20 recent studies
suggest that adding soy foods to your diet can
actually lower your cholesterol levels.
One-half cup of cooked soybeans has 14 grams
of protein; 4 ounces of tofu has 13. Either serv-
ing gives you approximately twice the protein
you get from one large egg or one 8-ounce glass
of skim milk, or two-thirds the protein in 3
ounces of lean ground beef. Eight ounces of fat-
free soy milk has 7 milligrams protein — a mere
1 milligram less than a similar serving of skim
milk — and no cholesterol. Soybeans are also
jam-packed with dietary fiber, which helps
move food through your digestive tract.
In fact, soybeans are such a good source of
food fiber that I feel obligated to add a caution-
ary note here. One day after I’d read through a
bunch of studies about soy’s effect on choles-
terol levels, I decided to lower my cholesterol
level right away. So I had a soy burger for lunch,
a half cup of soybeans and no-fat cheese for an
afternoon snack, and another half cup with
tomato sauce at dinner. Delicacy prohibits me
from explaining in detail how irritated and upset
all that fiber made my digestive tract, but I’m
sure you get the picture.
If you choose to use soybeans (or any other dry
beans for that matter), take it slow — a little
today, a little more tomorrow, and a little bit
more the day after that.

The basic standard against which you measure the value of proteins in food
is the egg. Nutrition scientists have arbitrarily given the egg a biological value
of 100 percent, meaning that, gram for gram, it’s the food with the best
supply of complete proteins. Other foods that have proportionately more
protein may not be as valuable as the egg because they lack sufficient
amounts of one or more essential amino acids.
For example, eggs are 11 percent protein, and dry beans are 22 percent pro-
tein. However, the proteins in beans don’t provide sufficient amounts of all
the essential amino acids, so they (the beans) are not as nutritionally com-
plete as proteins from animal foods. The prime exception is the soybean, a
legume that’s packed with abundant amounts of all of the amino acids essen-
tial for adults. Soybeans are an excellent source of proteins for vegetarians,
especially vegans, which are vegetarians who avoid all products of animal
origin, including milk and eggs.
The term used to describe the value of the proteins in any one food is amino
acid score. Because the egg contains all the essential amino acids, it scores
100. Table 6-1 shows the protein quality of representative foods relative to
the egg.

Complete proteins and incomplete proteins
Another way to describe the quality of proteins is to say that they’re either
complete or incomplete. A complete protein is one that contains ample
amounts of all essential amino acids; an incomplete protein does not. A pro-
tein low in one specific amino acid is called a limiting protein because it can
build only as much tissue as the smallest amount of the necessary amino
acid. You can improve the protein quality in a food containing incomplete/
limiting proteins by eating it along with one that contains sufficient amounts
of the limited amino acids. Matching foods to create complete proteins is
called complementarity.
For example, rice is low in the essential amino acid lysine, and beans are low
in the essential amino acid methionine. By eating rice with beans, you improve
(or complete) the proteins in both. Another example is pasta and cheese. Pasta
is low in the essential amino acids lysine and isoleucine; milk products have
abundant amounts of these two amino acids. Shaking Parmesan cheese onto
pasta creates a higher-quality protein dish. In each case, the foods have com-
plementary amino acids. Other examples of complementary protein dishes
are peanut butter with bread, and milk with cereal. Many such combinations
are a natural and customary part of the diet in parts of the world where animal
proteins are scarce or very expensive. Here are some categories of foods with
incomplete proteins:

Chapter 6: Powerful Protein
Homocysteine and your heart
Homocysteine is an intermediate, a chemical
released when you metabolize (digest) protein.
Unlike other amino acids, which are vital to your
health, homocysteine can be hazardous to your
heart, raising your risk of heart disease by
attacking cells in the lining of your arteries by
making them reproduce more quickly (the extra
cells may block your coronary arteries) or by
causing your blood to clot (ditto).
Years and years ago, before cholesterol moved
to center stage, some smart heart researchers
labeled homocysteine the major nutritional 
culprit in heart disease. Today, they’ve been 
vindicated. The American Heart Association
cites high homocysteine levels as an indepen-
dent probable (but not major) risk factor for
heart disease, perhaps explaining why some
people with low cholesterol have heart attacks.
But wait! The good news is that information
from several studies, including the Harvard/
Brigham and Women’s Hospital Nurses’ Health
Study in Boston, suggest that a diet rich in the B
vitamin folate lowers blood levels of homocys-
teine. Most fruits and vegetables have plentiful
amounts of folate. Stocking up on them may
protect your heart.

 Grain foods: Barley, bread, bulgur wheat, cornmeal, kasha, and pancakes
 Legumes: Black beans, black-eyed peas, fava beans, kidney beans, lima
beans, lentils, peanut butter, peanuts, peas, split peas, and white beans
 Nuts and seeds: Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, walnuts, pump-
kin seeds, sesame seeds (tahini), and sunflower seeds
In order for the foods to complement each other, you must eat them together.
In other words, rice and beans at one meal, not rice for lunch and beans for
dinner. Table 6-2 shows how to combine foods to improve the quality of their
proteins.

The lowdown on gelatin and your fingernails
Everyone knows that gelatin is protein that
strengthens fingernails. Too bad everyone’s
wrong. Gelatin is produced by treating animal
bones with acid, a process that destroys 
the essential amino acid tryptophan. Surprise:
Bananas are high in tryptophan. Slicing
bananas onto your gelatin increases the quality
of the protein. Adding milk makes it even better,
but that still may not heal your splitting nails.
The fastest way to a cure is a visit to the 
dermatologist, who can tell you whether the
problem is an allergy to nail polish, too much
time spent washing dishes, a medical problem
such as a fungal infection, or just plain peeling
nails. Then the dermatologist may prescribe a
different nail polish (or none at all), protective
gloves, a fungicide (a drug that wipes out fungi),
or a lotion product that strengthens the natural
glue that holds the layers of your nails together.

Deciding How Much Protein You Need
The National Academy of Sciences Food and Nutrition Board, which sets the
requirements (for example, RDAs) for vitamins and minerals, also sets goals
for daily protein consumption. As with other nutrients, the board has differ-
ent recommendations for different groups of people: young or older, men or
women.
Calculating the correct amount
As a general rule, the National Academy of Sciences says healthy people need
to get 10 to 35 percent of their daily calories from protein. More specifically,
the Academy has set a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of 45 grams protein per
day for a healthy woman and 52 grams per day for a healthy man. (Check out
Chapter 4 for a complete explanation of the DRI.)
These amounts are easily obtained from two to three 3-ounce servings of lean
meat, fish, or poultry (21 grams each). Vegetarians can get their protein from
2 eggs (12–16 grams), 2 slices of prepacked fat-free cheese (10 grams), 4
slices of bread (3 grams each), and one cup of yogurt (10 grams).
As you grow older, you synthesize new proteins less efficiently, so your muscle
mass (protein tissue) diminishes while your fat content stays the same or rises.
This change is why some folks erroneously believe that muscle “turns to fat” in
old age. Of course, you still use protein to build new tissue, including hair, skin,
and nails, which continue to grow until you cross over into The Great Beyond.
By the way, the idea that nails continue to grow after death — a staple of shock
movies and horror comics — arises from the fact that after death, tissue around
the nails shrinks, making a corpse’s nails simply look longer. Who else would let
you in on these secrets?
Dodging protein deficiency
The first sign of protein deficiency is likely to be weak muscles — the body
tissue most reliant on protein. For example, children who do not get enough
protein have shrunken, weak muscles. They may also have thin hair, their
skin may be covered with sores, and blood tests may show that the level of
albumin in their blood is below normal. Albumin is a protein that helps main-
tain the body’s fluid balance, keeping a proper amount of liquid in and
around body cells.
77
Chapter 6: Powerful Protein

A protein deficiency may also show up in your blood. Red blood cells live for
only 120 days. Protein is needed to produce new ones. People who do not get
enough protein may become anemic, having fewer red blood cells than they
need. Protein deficiency may also show up as fluid retention (the big belly on
a starving child), hair loss, and muscle wasting caused by the body’s attempt
to protect itself by digesting the proteins in its own muscle tissue. That’s why
victims of starvation are, literally, skin and bones.
Given the high protein content of a normal American diet (which generally
provides far more protein than you actually require), protein deficiency is
rare in the United States except as a consequence of eating disorders such as
anorexia nervosa (refusal to eat) and bulimia (regurgitation after meals).
Boosting your protein intake: 
Special considerations
Anyone who’s building new tissue quickly needs extra protein. For example,
the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for protein for women who are pregnant or
nursing is 71 grams per day. Injuries also raise your protein requirements. An
injured body releases above-normal amounts of protein-destroying hormones
from the pituitary and adrenal glands. You need extra protein to protect exist-
ing tissues, and after severe blood loss, you need extra protein to make new
hemoglobin for red blood cells. Cuts, burns, or surgical procedures mean that
you need extra protein to make new skin and muscle cells. Fractures mean
extra protein is needed to make new bone. The need for protein is so impor-
tant when you’ve been badly injured that if you can’t take protein by mouth,
you’ll be given an intravenous solution of amino acids with glucose (sugar) or
emulsified fat.
Do athletes need more proteins than the rest of us? Recent research suggests
that the answer may be yes, but athletes easily meet their requirements by
increasing the amount of food in their normal diet.
Avoiding protein overload
Yes, you can get too much protein. Several medical conditions make it diffi-
cult for people to digest and process proteins properly. As a result, waste
products build up in different parts of the body.
People with liver disease or kidney disease either don’t process protein effi-
ciently into urea or don’t excrete it efficiently through urine. The result may
78
Part II: What You Get from Food 

be uric acid kidney stones or uremic poisoning (an excess amount of uric acid
in the blood). The pain associated with gout (a form of arthritis that affects
nine men for every one woman) is caused by uric acid crystals collecting in
the spaces around joints. Doctors may recommend a low-protein diet as part
of the treatment in these situations.

The Lowdown on Fat 
and Cholesterol
In This Chapter
 Assessing the value of fat
 Discovering the different kinds of fat in food
 Explaining why you need some cholesterol
 Balancing the fat (and cholesterol) in your diet
T
he chemical family name for fats and related compounds such as choles-
terol is lipids (from lipos, the Greek word for fat). Liquid fats are called
oils; solid fats are called, well, fat. With the exception of cholesterol (a fatty
substance that has no calories and provides no energy), fats are high-energy
nutrients. Gram for gram, fats have more than twice as much energy potential
(calories) as protein and carbohydrates (affectionately referred to as carbs):
9 calories per fat gram versus 4 calories per gram for proteins and carbs. (For
more calorie facts, see Chapter 3.)
In this chapter, I cut the fat away from the subject of fats and zero in on the
essential facts you need to put together a diet with just enough fat (yes, you
do need fat) to provide the bounce that every diet requires. And then I deal
with that ultimate baddie — cholesterol. Surprise! You need some of that,
too. Onward.
Finding the Facts about Fat Stuff
Fats are sources of energy that add flavor to food — the sizzle on the steak,
you can say. However, as anyone who’s spent the last 30 years on planet Earth
knows, fats may also be hazardous to your health. The trick is separating the
good from the bad. Trust me. It can be done. And this section explains how.

Understanding how your body uses fat
Here’s a sentence that you probably never thought you’d read: A healthy
body needs fat. Your body uses dietary fat (the fat that you get from food) to
make tissue and manufacture biochemicals, such as hormones. Some of the
body fat made from food fat is visible. Even though your skin covers it, you
can see the fat in the adipose (fatty) tissue in female breasts, hips, thighs, but-
tocks, and belly or male abdomen and shoulders.
This visible body fat
 Provides a source of stored energy
 Gives shape to your body
 Cushions your skin (imagine sitting in a chair for a while to read this
book without your buttocks to pillow your bones)
 Acts as an insulation blanket that reduces heat loss
Other body fat is invisible. You can’t see this body fat because it’s tucked
away in and around your internal organs. This hidden fat is
 Part of every cell membrane (the outer skin that holds each cell together)
 A component of myelin, the fatty material that sheathes nerve cells and
makes it possible for them to fire the electrical messages that enable
you to think, see, speak, move, and perform the multitude of tasks nat-
ural to a living body; brain tissue also is rich in fat
 A shock absorber that protects your organs (as much as possible) if you
fall or are injured
 A constituent of hormones and other biochemicals, such as vitamin D
and bile
Pulling energy from fat
Although fat has more energy (calories) per gram than proteins and carbohy-
drates, your body has a more difficult time pulling the energy out of fatty
foods. Imagine a chain of long balloons — the kind people twist into shapes
that resemble dachshunds, flowers, and other amusing things. When you drop
one of these balloons into water, it floats. That’s exactly what happens when
you swallow fat-rich foods. The fat floats on top of the watery food-and-liquid
mixture in your stomach, which limits the effect that lipases — fat-busting
digestive enzymes in the mix below — can have on it. Because fat is digested
more slowly than proteins and carbohydrates, you feel fuller (a condition
called satiety) longer after eating high-fat food.
82
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Into the intestines
When the fat moves down your digestive tract into your small intestine, an
intestinal hormone called cholestokinin beeps your gallbladder, signaling for
the release of bile. Bile is an emulsifier, a substance that enables fat to mix
with water so that lipases can start breaking the fat into glycerol and fatty
acids. These smaller fragments may be stored in special cells (fat cells) in
adipose tissue, or they may be absorbed into cells in the intestinal wall,
where one of the following happens:
 They’re combined with oxygen (or burned) to produce heat/energy,
water, and the waste product carbon dioxide.
 They’re used to make lipoproteins that haul fats, including cholesterol,
through your bloodstream.
Into the body
Glucose, the molecule you get by digesting carbohydrates, is the body’s basic
source of energy. Burning glucose is easier and more efficient than burning fat,
so your body always goes for carbohydrates first. But if you’ve used up all your
available glucose — maybe you’re stranded in a cabin in the Arctic, you haven’t
eaten for a week, a blizzard’s howling outside, and the corner deli 500 miles
down the road doesn’t deliver — then it’s time to start in on your body fat.
The first step is for an enzyme in your fat cells to break up stored triglyc-
erides (the form of fat in adipose tissue). The enzyme action releases glycerol
and fatty acids, which travel through your blood to body cells, where they
combine with oxygen to produce heat/energy, plus water — lots of water —
and the waste product carbon dioxide. As anyone who has used a high-
protein/high-fat/low-carb weight-loss diet such as the Atkins regimen can tell
you, in addition to all that water, burning fat without glucose produces a
second waste product called ketones. In extreme cases, high concentrations
of ketones (a condition known as ketosis) alter the acid/alkaline balance (or
pH) of your blood and may trip you into a coma. Left untreated, ketosis can
lead to death. Medically, this condition is most common among people with
diabetes. For people on a low-carb diet, the more likely sign of ketosis is
stinky urine or breath that smells like acetone (nail polish remover).
Focusing on the fats in food
Food contains three kinds of fats: triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols.
Here’s how they differ:
 Triglycerides: You use these fats to make adipose tissue and burn for
energy.
 Phospholipids: Phospholipids are hybrids — part lipid, part phosphate (a
molecule made with the mineral phosphorus) — that act as tiny rowboats,
83
Chapter 7: The Lowdown on Fat and Cholesterol

ferrying hormones and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K through your
blood and back and forth in the watery fluid that flows across cell mem-
branes. (By the way, the official name for fluid around cells is extracellu-
lar fluid. See why I just called it watery fluid?)
 Sterols (steroid alcohols): These are fat and alcohol compounds with no
calories. Vitamin D is a sterol. So is the sex hormone testosterone. And so
is cholesterol, the base on which your body builds hormones and vitamins.
Getting the right amount of fat
Getting the right amount of fat in your diet is a delicate balancing act. Too much,
and you increase your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and some forms
of cancer. (The risk of colon cancer seems to be tied more clearly to a diet high
in fat from meat rather than fat from dairy products.) Too little fat, and infants
don’t thrive, children don’t grow, and everyone, regardless of age, is unable to
absorb and use fat-soluble vitamins that smooth the skin, protect vision, bolster
the immune system, and keep reproductive organs functioning.
In the fall of 2002, the National Academies’ Institute of Medicine (IOM) recom-
mended that no more than 20 to 45 percent of daily calories should come
from fat. On a 2,000-calorie daily diet, that’s 400 to 900 calories from fats a
day. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 (see Chapter 16) lowers that
to 20 to 30 percent of total calories. Translation: 400 to 600 of the calories on
a 2,000-calorie/day regimen.
Because your body doesn’t need to get saturated fats, cholesterol, or trans fats
from food, neither IOM nor the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 have set
levels for these nutrients, except to say, “Keep them as low as possible, please.”
This advice about fat intake is primarily for adults. Although many organiza-
tions, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart
Association, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, recommend
restricting fat intake for older children, they stress that infants and toddlers
require fatty acids for proper physical growth and mental development, and
that’s why Mother Nature made human breast milk (see Chapter 28) so high
in fatty acids. Never limit the fat in your baby’s diet without checking first
with your pediatrician.
Essential fatty acids
An essential fatty acid is one that your body needs but cannot assemble from
other fats. You have to get it whole, from food. Linoleic acid, found in veg-
etable oils, is an essential fatty acid. Two others — linolenic acid and arachi-
donic acid — occupy a somewhat ambiguous position. You can’t make them
from scratch, but you can make them if you have enough linoleic acid on
84
Part II: What You Get from Food 

hand, so food scientists can work up a good fight about whether linolenic 
and arachidonic acids are actually “essential.” In practical terms, who cares?
Linoleic acid is so widely available in food, you’re unlikely to experience a
deficiency of any of the three — linoleic, linolenic, or arachidonic acids — as
long as 2 percent of the calories you get each day come from fat.
In 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published the first daily recommenda-
tions for two essential fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid and linolenic acid. The
former is an omega-3 fatty acid (more about that later on in this chapter)
that’s found in fish oils, milk, and some veggie oils. The latter is an omega-6
fatty acid (ditto), found in safflower and corn oil. IOM recommends that
 Women get 12 grams linolenic acid and 1.1 grams alpha-linolenic acid
per day
 Men get 17 grams linolenic acid and 1.6 grams alpha-linolenic acid per day
Finding fat in all kinds of foods
As a general rule:
 Fruits and vegetables have only traces of fat, primarily unsaturated 
fatty acids.
 Grains have small amounts of fat, up to 3 percent of their total weight.
 Dairy products vary. Cream is a high-fat food. Regular milks and cheeses
are moderately high in fat. Skim milk and skim milk products are low-fat
foods. Most of the fat in any dairy product is saturated fatty acids.
 Meat is moderately high in fat, and most of its fats are saturated fatty acids.
 Poultry (chicken and turkey), without the skin, is relatively low in fat.
 Fish may be high or low in fat, primarily unsaturated fatty acids that —
lucky for the fish — remain liquid even when the fish is swimming in
cold water. (Saturated fats harden when cooled.)
 Vegetable oils, butter, and lard are high-fat foods. Most of the fatty acids
in vegetable oils are unsaturated; most of the fatty acids in lard and
butter are saturated.
 Processed foods, such as cakes, breads, canned or frozen meat, and veg-
etable dishes, are generally higher in fat than plain grains, meats, fruits,
and vegetables.
Here’s a simple guide to finding which foods are high (or low) in fat. Oils are
virtually 100 percent fat. Butter and lard are close behind. After that, the fat
level drops, from 70 percent for some nuts down to 2 percent for most bread.
The rule to take away from these numbers? A diet high in grains and plants
always is lower in fat than a diet high in meat and oils.
85
Chapter 7: The Lowdown on Fat and Cholesterol

Defining fatty acids and their 
relationship to dietary fat
Fatty acids are the building blocks of fats. Chemically speaking, a fatty acid is
a chain of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached and a carbon-oxygen-
oxygen-hydrogen group (the unit that makes it an acid) at one end.
All the fats in food are combinations of fatty acids. Nutritionists characterize
fatty acids as saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated, depending on
how many hydrogen atoms are attached to the carbon atoms in the chain.
The more hydrogen atoms, the more saturated the fatty acid. Depending on
which fatty acids predominate, a food fat is likewise characterized as satu-
rated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated.
 A saturated fat, such as butter, has mostly saturated fatty acids.
Saturated fats are solid at room temperature and get harder when
chilled.
 A monounsaturated fat, such as olive oil, has mostly monounsaturated
fatty acids. Monounsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature; they
get thicker when chilled.
 A polyunsaturated fat, such as corn oil, has mostly polyunsaturated fatty
acids. Polyunsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature; they stay
liquid when chilled.
So why is margarine, which is made from unsaturated fats such as corn and
soybean oil, a solid? Because it’s been artificially saturated by food chemists
who add hydrogen atoms to some of its unsaturated fatty acids. This
process, known as hydrogenation, turns an oil, such as corn oil, into a solid
fat that can be used in products such as margarines without leaking out all
over the table. A fatty acid with extra hydrogen atoms is called a hydro-
genated fatty acid. Another name for hydrogenated fatty acid is trans fatty
acid. Trans fatty acids are not healthy for your heart. Because of those darned
extra hydrogen atoms, they are, well, more saturated, and they act like —
what else? — saturated fats, clogging arteries and raising the levels of choles-
terol in your blood. To make it easier for you to control your trans fat intake,
the Food and Drug Administration now requires a new line on the Nutritional
Facts label that tells you exactly how many grams of trans fats are in any
product you buy.
In the meantime, as I explain in Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies (a whole
doggone book — published by Wiley — on how to whip your cholesterol pro-
file into shape), the same smart food chemists who invented hydrogenation
have now come up with trans fat–free margarines and spreads, including
some that are made with plant sterols and stanols.

Chapter 7: The Lowdown on Fat and Cholesterol
A nutritional fish story
When Sir William Gilbert, lyricist to songsmith
Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote, “Here’s a pretty kettle
of fish!” he may well have been talking about
the latest skinny on seafood.
The good news from a 2002 Harvard survey of
more than 43,000 male health professionals
shows that the ones who eat 3 to 5 ounces of
fish just once a month have a 40 percent lower
risk of ischemic stroke, a stroke caused by a
blood clot in a cranial artery. The Harvard study
did not include women, but a report on women
and stroke published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association in 2000 says that
women who eat about 4 ounces of fish — think
one small can of tuna — two to four times a
week appear to cut their risk of stroke by a sim-
ilar 40 percent.
These benefits are, in large part, because of 
the presence of omega-3 fatty acids, which 
are unsaturated fatty acids found most com-
monly in fatty fish such as salmon and sardines.
The primary omega-3 is alpha-linolenic acid,
which your body converts to hormonelike sub-
stances called eicosanoids. The eicosanoids —
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosa-
hexaenoic acid (DHA) — reduce inflammation,
perhaps by inhibiting an enzyme called COX-2,
which is linked to inflammatory diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Arthritis
Foundation says omega-3s relieve RA joint
inflammation, swelling, and pain.
Omega-3s also are heart-friendly. The fats make
the tiny blood particles called platelets less
sticky, reducing the possibility that they’ll clump
together to form blood clots that might obstruct
a blood vessel and trigger a heart attack.
Omega-3s also knock down levels of bad cho-
lesterol so effectively that the American Heart
Association recommends eating fish at least
twice a week. Besides, fish also is a good
source of taurine, an amino acid the journal
Circulation notes helps maintain the elasticity of
blood vessels, which means that the vessels
may dilate to permit blood or — horrors! — a
blot clot to flow through.
Did I mention that omega-3s are bone builders?
Fish oils enable your body to create calciferol,
a naturally occurring form of vitamin D, the
nutrient that enables your body to absorb bone-
building calcium — which may be why omega-
3s appear to help hold minerals in bone — and
increase the formation of new bone.
Plant sterols are natural compounds found in oils in grains, fruits, and veg-
etables, including soybeans, while stanols are compounds created by adding
hydrogen atoms to sterols from wood pulp and other plant sources. Sterols
and stanols work like little sponges, sopping up cholesterol in your intestines
before it can make its way into your bloodstream. As a result, your total 
cholesterol levels and your levels of low-density lipoproteins (otherwise
known as LDLs or “bad cholesterol”) go down. In some studies, one to two 
1-tablespoon servings a day of sterols and stanols can lower levels of bad
cholesterol by 10 to 17 percent, with results showing up in as little as two
weeks. Wow!
(continued)

Table 7-1 shows the kinds of fatty acids found in some common dietary fats
and oils. Fats are characterized according to their predominant fatty acids.
For example, as you can plainly see in the table, nearly 25 percent of the fatty
acids in corn oil are monounsaturated fatty acids. Nevertheless, because
corn oil has more polyunsaturated fatty acid, corn oil is considered a polyun-
saturated fatty acid. Note for math majors: Some of the totals in Table 7-1
don’t add up to 100 percent because these fats and oils also contain other
kinds of fatty acids in amounts so small that they don’t affect the basic char-
acter of the fat.

Before you shout, “Waiter! Bring me the
salmon, mackerel, herring, or whatever,” here’s
the other side of the coin. Earlier research 
suggests that frequent servings of fish may
increase the risk of a stroke caused by bleeding
in the brain. This situation is common among
Native Alaskans who eat plenty of fish and have
a higher than normal incidence of hemorrhagic,
or bleeding, strokes. True, the Harvard study
found no significant link between fish con-
sumption and bleeding strokes, but researchers
say more studies are needed to nail down the
relationship — or lack thereof.

Not all omegas are equally beneficial. Omega-6
fatty acids — polyunsaturated fats found in
beef, pork, and several vegetable oils, including
corn, sunflower, cottonseed, soybean, peanut,
and sesame oils — are chemical cousins of
omega-3s, but the omega-6s lack the benefits of
the omega-3s.

some fish, particularly those caught in the 
wild (rather than raised on a fish farm), may be
contaminated with metals such as mercury,
which has made its way into the water as indus-

who are or may be pregnant. Check the food

Chapter 7: The Lowdown on Fat and Cholesterol
Exploring the chemical structure of fatty acids
If you don’t have a clue about the chemical
structure of fatty acids, reading this explanation
may be worth your while. The concepts are
simple, and the information you find here applies
to all kinds of molecules, not just fatty acids.
Molecules are groups of atoms hooked together
by chemical bonds. Different atoms form differ-
ent numbers of bonds with other atoms. For
example, a hydrogen atom can form one bond
with one other atom; an oxygen atom can form
two bonds with other atoms; and a carbon atom
can form four bonds to other atoms.
To actually see how this works, visualize a carbon
atom as one of those round pieces in a child’s
Erector set or Tinkertoy kit. Your carbon atom (C)
has — figuratively speaking, of course — four
holes: one on top, one on the bottom, and one
on each side. If you stick a peg into each hole
and attach a small piece of wood representing
a hydrogen atom (H) to the pegs on the top, the
bottom, and the left, you have a structure that
looks like this:
This unit, called a methyl group, is the first piece
in any fatty acid. To build the rest of the fatty
acid, you add carbon atoms and hydrogen
atoms to form a chain. At the end, you tack on a
group with one carbon atom, two oxygen atoms,
and a hydrogen atom. This group is called an
acid group, the part that makes the chain of
carbon and hydrogen atoms a fatty acid.
The preceding molecule is a saturated fatty
acid because it has a hydrogen atom at every
available carbon link in the chain. A monoun-
saturated fatty acid drops two hydrogen atoms
and forms one double bond (two lines instead of
one) between two carbon atoms. A polyunsat-
urated fatty acid drops more hydrogen atoms
and forms several (poly) double bonds between
several carbon atoms. Every hydrogen atom still
forms one bond, and every carbon atom still
forms four bonds, but they do so in a slightly dif-
ferent way. These sketches are not pictures of
real fatty acids, which have many more carbons
in the chain and have their double bonds in dif-
ferent places, but they can give you an idea of
what fatty acids look like up close.

Considering Cholesterol and You
I mention earlier in this chapter that your body actually needs fat, and here’s
another sentence that may blow your (nutritional) mind: Every healthy body
needs cholesterol. Look carefully and you find cholesterol in and around your
cells, in your fatty tissue, in your organs, and in your glands. What’s it doing
there? Plenty of useful things. For example, cholesterol
 Protects the integrity of cell membranes
 Helps enable nerve cells to send messages back and forth
90
Part II: What You Get from Food 

 Is a building block for vitamin D (a sterol), made when sunlight hits the
fat just under your skin (for more about vitamin D, see Chapter 10)
 Enables your gallbladder to make bile acids, digestive chemicals that, in
turn, enable you to absorb fats and fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamin
A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K
 Is a base on which you build steroid hormones such as estrogen and
testosterone
Cholesterol and heart disease
Doctors measure your cholesterol level by taking a sample of blood and
counting the milligrams of cholesterol in 1 deciliter (1⁄10 liter) of blood. When
you get your annual report from the doctor, your total cholesterol level looks
something like this: 225 mg/dl. Translation: You have 225 milligrams of cho-
lesterol in every tenth of a liter of blood. Why does this matter? Because 
cholesterol makes its way into blood vessels, sticks to the walls, and forms
deposits that eventually block the flow of blood. The more cholesterol you
have floating in your blood, the more cholesterol is likely to cross into your
arteries, where it may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke.
As a general rule, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) says
that for adults, a cholesterol level higher than 250 mg/dl is a high risk factor
for heart disease; between 200 mg/dl and 250 mg/dl is considered a moderate
risk factor; below 200 mg/dl is considered a low risk factor.
Cholesterol levels alone are not the entire story. Many people with high cho-
lesterol levels live to a ripe old age, but others with low total cholesterol
levels develop heart disease. Worse yet, recent research indicates that low
cholesterol levels may increase the risk of stroke. In other words, cholesterol
is only one of several risk factors for heart disease. Here are some more:
 An unfavorable ratio of lipoproteins (see the following section)
 Smoking
 Obesity
 Age (being older is riskier)
 Sex (being male is riskier)
 A family history of heart disease
To estimate your own risk of heart disease/heart attack, check out the NCEP
heart attack risk calculator at hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/atpiii/calculator.

Chapter 7: The Lowdown on Fat and Cholesterol

Living with lipoproteins
A lipoprotein is a fat (lipo = fat, remember?) and protein particle that carries
cholesterol through your blood. Your body makes four types of lipoproteins:
chylomicrons, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), low-density lipopro-
teins (LDLs), and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). As a general rule, LDLs
take cholesterol into blood vessels; HDLs carry it out of the body.
A lipoprotein is born as a chylomicron, made in your intestinal cells from pro-
tein and triglycerides (fats). After 12 hours of traveling through your blood
and around your body, a chylomicron has lost virtually all of its fats. By the
time the chylomicron makes its way to your liver, the only thing left is protein.
The liver, a veritable fat and cholesterol factory, collects fatty acid fragments
from your blood and uses them to make cholesterol and new fatty acids. Time

Cholesterol season
Even if you allow yourself to indulge in (a few)
high-cholesterol ice cream cones and burgers
every day of the year, your cholesterol level may
still be naturally lower in the summer than in
winter.
The basis for this intriguing culinary conclusion
is the 2004 University of Massachusetts SEA-
SONS (Seasonal Variation in Blood Lipids) Study
of 517 healthy men and women ages 20 to 70.
The volunteers started out with an average cho-
lesterol level of 213 mg/dl (women) to 222 mg/dl
(men). A series of five blood tests during the
one-year study showed an average drop of 4
points in the summer for men and 5.4 points for
women. People with high cholesterol (above
240 mg/dl) did better, dropping as much as 18
points in the summer.
U. Mass cardiologists say one explanation for
the summer downswing may be the normal
increase in human blood volume in hot weather.
Cholesterol levels reflect the total amount of
cholesterol in your bloodstream. With more
blood in the stream, the amount of cholesterol
per deciliter declines, producing a lower total
cholesterol reading. A second possibility is that
people tend to eat less and be more active in
summer. They lose weight, and weight loss
equals lower cholesterol.
The first bit of wisdom from this study is obvi-

do better to start during the cool weather, when
your efforts may lower your total cholesterol as

time, say, six months. Then when your doctor

you’ll get the added benefit of the seasonal slip

out! How much cholesterol you get from food may affect your liver’s daily
output: Eat more cholesterol, and your liver may make less. If you eat less
cholesterol, your liver may make more. And so it goes.
Churning out harmful lipoproteins
Okay, after your liver has made cholesterol and fatty acids, it packages them
with protein as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), which have more pro-
tein and are denser than their precursors, the chylomicrons. As VLDLs travel
through your bloodstream, they lose triglycerides, pick up cholesterol, and
turn into low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). LDLs supply cholesterol to your
body cells, which use it to make new cell membranes and manufacture sterol
compounds such as hormones. That’s the good news.
The bad news is that both VLDLs and LDLs are soft and squishy enough to
pass through blood vessel walls. The larger and squishier they are, the more
likely they are to slide into your arteries, which means that VLDLs are more
hazardous to your health than plain old LDLs. These fluffy, fatty lipoproteins
carry cholesterol into blood vessels, where it can cling to the inside wall,
forming deposits, or plaques. These plaques may eventually block an artery,
prevent blood from flowing through, and trigger a heart attack or stroke.
Whew! Got all that?
VLDLs and LDLs are sometimes called “bad cholesterol,” but this characteri-
zation is a misnomer. They aren’t cholesterol; they’re just the rafts on which
cholesterol sails into your arteries. Traveling through the body, LDLs con-
tinue to lose cholesterol. In the end, they lose so much fat that they become
mostly protein — turning them into high-density lipoproteins, the particles
sometimes called “good cholesterol.” Once again, this label is inaccurate.
HDLs aren’t cholesterol: They’re simply protein and fat particles too dense
and compact to pass through blood vessel walls, so they carry cholesterol
out of the body rather than into arteries.
That’s why a high level of HDLs may reduce your risk of heart attack regard-
less of your total cholesterol levels. Conversely, a high level of LDLs may
raise your risk of heart attack, even if your overall cholesterol level is low.
Hey, on second thought, maybe that does qualify them as “good” and “bad”
cholesterol.
Setting limits on the bad guys
At one point, back in the dawn of the Cholesterol Age, like, say, five years ago,
the “safe” upper limit for LDLs was assumed to be around 160 mg/dl. Now,
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, American College of Cardiology,
and the American Heart Association have all put their stamps of approval on
the National Cholesterol Education Program’s (NCEP) recommendations for
93
Chapter 7: The Lowdown on Fat and Cholesterol

new, lower levels of LDLs based on the presence of the risk factors I list
under “Cholesterol and heart disease.” You know — diabetes, high blood
pressure, obesity . . . those risk factors.
For healthy people with two or more risk factors, the new goal is to push
LDLs below 130 mg/dl. For high-risk patients with heart disease or blood
vessel problems and more than two risk factors, it’s LDLs below 100 mg/dl.
For very high-risk patients who are hospitalized with heart disease or have
heart disease plus several risk factors, LDLs should be under 70 mg/dl. If nec-
essary, the NCEP suggests using cholesterol-busting “statin” drugs such as
atorvastatin (Lipitor).
Diet and cholesterol
Most of the cholesterol that you need is made right in your own liver, which
churns out about 1 gram (1,000 milligrams) a day from the raw materials in
the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that you consume. But you also get cho-
lesterol from food of animal origin: meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy prod-
ucts. Although some plant foods, such as coconuts and cocoa beans, are high
in saturated fats, no plants actually have cholesterol. Table 7-2 lists the
amount of cholesterol in normal servings of some representative foods.
Because plants don’t contain cholesterol, no plant foods are on this list. No
grains. No fruits. No veggies. No nuts and seeds. Of course, you can juice
plant food up with cholesterol if you really try: Butter in the bread dough,
cheese on the macaroni, cream sauce on the peas and onions, whipped
cream on poached peaches, and so on.

C
arbohydrates — the name means carbon plus water — are sugar com-
pounds that plants make when they’re exposed to light. This process of
making sugar compounds is called photosynthesis, from the Latin words for
“light” and “putting together.”
In this chapter, I shine a bright light on the different kinds of carbohydrates,
illuminating all the nutritional nooks and crannies to explain how each con-
tributes to your vim and vigor — not to mention a yummy daily menu.
Checking Out Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates come in three varieties: simple carbohydrates, complex car-
bohydrates, and dietary fiber. All are composed of units of sugar. What makes
one carbohydrate different from another is the number of sugar units it con-
tains and how the units are linked together.
 Simple carbohydrates: These carbohydrates have only one or two units
of sugar.
• A carbohydrate with one unit of sugar is called a simple sugar or a
monosaccharide (mono = one; saccharide = sugar). Fructose (fruit
sugar) is a monosaccharide, and so are glucose (blood sugar), the
sugar produced when you digest carbohydrates, and galactose, 
the sugar derived from digesting lactose (milk sugar).

• A carbohydrate with two units of sugar is called a double sugar or a
disaccharide (di = two). Sucrose (table sugar), which is made of one
unit of fructose and one unit of glucose, is a disaccharide.
 Complex carbohydrates: Also known as polysaccharides (poly = many),
these carbs have more than two units of sugar linked together. Carbs
with three to ten units of sugar are sometimes called oligosaccharides
(oligo = few).
• Raffinose is a trisaccharide (tri = three) that’s found in potatoes,
beans, and beets. It has one unit each of galactose, glucose, and
fructose.
• Stachyose is a tetrasaccharide (tetra = four) found in the same veg-
etables mentioned in the previous item. It has one fructose unit,
one glucose unit, and two galactose units.
• Starch, a complex carbohydrate in potatoes, pasta, and rice, is a
definite polysaccharide, made of many units of glucose.
Because complex carbohydrates are, well, complex, with anywhere from
three to a zillion units of sugars, your body takes longer to digest them
than it takes to digest simple carbohydrates. As a result, digesting com-
plex carbohydrates releases glucose into your bloodstream more slowly
and evenly than digesting simple carbs. (For more about digesting carbs,
see the section “Carbohydrates and energy: A biochemical love story,”
later in this chapter.)
 Dietary fiber: This term is used to distinguish the fiber in food from the
natural and synthetic fibers (silk, cotton, wool, nylon) used in fabrics.
Dietary fiber is a third kind of carbohydrate.
• Like the complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber (cellulose, hemicel-
lulose, pectin, beta-glucans, gum) is a polysaccharide. Lignin, a dif-
ferent kind of chemical, is also called a dietary fiber.
• Some kinds of dietary fiber also contain units of soluble or insolu-
ble uronic acids, compounds derived from the sugars fructose, glu-
cose, and galactose. For example, pectin — a soluble fiber in
apples — contains soluble galacturonic acid.
Dietary fiber is not like other carbohydrates. The bonds that hold its sugar
units together cannot be broken by human digestive enzymes. Although the
bacteria living naturally in your intestines convert very small amounts of
dietary fiber to fatty acids, dietary fiber is not considered a source of energy.
(For more about fatty acids, see Chapter 7.)
In the next section, I talk about how your body gets energy from carbohy-
drates. Because dietary fiber does not provide energy, I’m going to put it
aside for the moment and get back to it in the “Dietary Fiber: The Non-
Nutrient in Carbohydrate Foods” section, later in this chapter.

Charting the sweetness of carbs
The information in the following table has
absolutely no practical value. It’s strictly trivia
for your own personal nutrition data bank. Of
course, you can call it up for use in social situ-
ations. For example, suppose you’re standing in
line at the hot dog stand at Yankee Stadium,
looking for a way to start up a conversation with
the trim, attractive person in front of you, who
obviously cares about diet and health. “Wow,”
you may say. “Did you notice the cola over there
is sweetened with both fructose and sucrose —
a monosaccharide and a disaccharide, both in
the same drink? And given how nutrition-savvy
they are here, I bet the hot dog rolls are loaded
with polysaccharides.” Who could resist such
a high-minded, intellectual approach?

Carbohydrates and energy: 
A biochemical love story
Your body runs on glucose, the molecules your cells burn for energy. (For
more information on how you get energy from food, check out Chapter 3.)
Proteins, fats, and alcohol (as in beer, wine, and spirits) also provide energy
in the form of calories. And protein does give you glucose, but it takes a long
time, relatively speaking, for your body to get it.
When you eat carbohydrates, your pancreas secretes insulin, the hormone
that enables you to digest starches and sugars. This release of insulin is
sometimes called an insulin spike, which means the same thing as “insulin
secretion” but sounds a whole lot more sinister.
Eating simple carbohydrates such as sucrose (table sugar) provokes higher
insulin secretion than eating complex carbohydrates such as starch. If you
have a metabolic disorder such as diabetes that keeps you from producing
enough insulin, you must be careful not to take in more carbs than you can
digest. Unmetabolized sugars circulating through your blood can make you
dizzy and maybe even trip you into a diabetic coma.
What makes this interesting is that some perfectly healthful foods, such as
carrots, potatoes, and white bread, have more simple carbs than others, such
as apples, lentils, peanuts, and whole wheat bread. The Glycemic Index, devel-
oped at the University of Toronto in 1981, gives you a handle on this by rank-
ing foods according to how quickly they affect blood sugar levels when com-
pared to glucose (the form of sugar your body uses as energy), the glycemic
indicator par excellence.
(continued)

Most people who don’t have a metabolic disorder (such as diabetes) that inter-
feres with the ability to digest carbs can metabolize even very large amounts of
carbohydrate foods easily. Their insulin secretion rises to meet the demand
and then quickly settles back to normal. In other words, although some popu-
lar weight loss programs, such as the South Beach Diet, rely on the Glycemic
Index as a weight loss tool, the fact remains that for most people, a carb is a
carb is a carb, regardless of how quickly the sugar enters the bloodstream.
Check it out in Diabetes For Dummies.
For info on why the difference between simple and complex carbs can matter
for athletes, check out the section called “Who needs extra carbohydrates?”
How glucose becomes energy
Inside your cells, the glucose is burned to produce heat and adenosine
triphosphate, a molecule that stores and releases energy as required by the
cell. By the way, nutrition scientists, who have as much trouble pronouncing
polysyllabic words as you probably do, usually refer to adenosine triphos-
phate by its initials: ATP. Smart cookies!
The transformation of glucose into energy occurs in one of two ways: with
oxygen or without it. Glucose is converted to energy with oxygen in the mito-
chondria — tiny bodies in the jellylike substance inside every cell. This con-
version yields energy (ATP, heat) plus water and carbon dioxide — a waste
product.
Red blood cells do not have mitochondria, so they change glucose into energy
without oxygen. This yields energy (ATP, heat) and lactic acid.
Glucose is also converted to energy in muscle cells. When it comes to produc-
ing energy from glucose, muscle cells are, well, double-jointed. They have mito-
chondria, so they can process glucose with oxygen. But if the level of oxygen in
the muscle cell falls very low, the cells can just go ahead and change glucose
into energy without it. This is most likely to happen when you’ve been exercis-
ing so strenuously that you (and your muscles) are, literally, out of breath.
Being able to turn glucose into energy without oxygen is a handy trick, but
here’s the downside: One byproduct is lactic acid. Why is that a big deal? Too
much lactic acid makes your muscles ache.
How pasta ends up on your hips when 
too many carbs pass your lips
Your cells budget energy very carefully. They do not store more than they need
right now. Any glucose the cell does not need for its daily work is converted to
101
Chapter 8: Carbohydrates: A Complex Story

glycogen (animal starch) and tucked away as stored energy in your liver and
muscles.
Your body can pack about 400 grams (14 ounces) of glycogen into liver and
muscle cells. A gram of carbohydrates — including glucose — has four calo-
ries. If you add up all the glucose stored in glycogen to the small amount of
glucose in your cells and blood, it equals about 1,800 calories of energy.
If your diet provides more carbohydrates than you need to produce this
amount of stored calories in the form of glucose and glycogen in your cells,
blood, muscles, and liver, the excess will be converted to fat. And that’s how
your pasta ends up on your hips.
Other ways your body uses carbohydrates
Providing energy is an important job, but it isn’t the only thing carbohydrates
do for you. Carbohydrates also protect your muscles. When you need energy,
your body looks for glucose from carbohydrates first. If none is available,
because you’re on a carbohydrate-restricted diet or have a medical condition
that prevents you from using the carbohydrate foods you consume, your
body begins to pull energy out of fatty tissue and then moves on to burning
its own protein tissue (muscles). If this use of proteins for energy continues
long enough, you run out of fuel and die.
A diet that provides sufficient amounts of carbohydrates keeps your body
from eating its own muscles. That’s why a carbohydrate-rich diet is some-
times described as protein sparing.
What else do carbohydrates do? They
 Regulate the amount of sugar circulating in your blood so that all your
cells get the energy they need
 Provide nutrients for the friendly bacteria in your intestinal tract that
help digest food
 Assist in your body’s absorption of calcium
 May help lower cholesterol levels and regulate blood pressure (these
effects are special benefits of dietary fiber, which I discuss in the
“Dietary Fiber: The Non-Nutrient in Carbohydrate Foods” section, later
in this chapter)
Finding the carbohydrates you need
The most important sources of carbohydrates are plant foods — fruits, veg-
etables, and grains. Milk and milk products contain the carbohydrate lactose
(milk sugar), but meat, fish, and poultry have no carbohydrates at all.
102
Part II: What You Get from Food 

In the fall of 2002, the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine
(IOM) released a report recommending that 45 to 65 percent of your daily
calories come from carbohydrate foods. The Food Guide Pyramid (see more
about that in Chapter 17) makes it easy for you to build a nutritious carb-
based diet with portion allowances based on how many calories you con-
sume each day in
 6 to 11 servings of grain foods (bread, cereals, pasta, rice), plus
 2 to 4 servings of fruit and
 3 to 5 servings of vegetables
These foods provide simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, and the
natural bonus of dietary fiber. Table sugar, honey, and sweets — which provide
simple carbohydrates — are recommended only on a once-in-a-while basis.
One gram of carbohydrates has four calories. To find the number of calories
from the carbohydrates in a serving, multiply the number of grams of carbohy-
drates by four. For example, one whole bagel has about 38 grams of carbohy-
drates, equal to about 152 calories (38 × 4). (You have to say “about” because
the dietary fiber in the bagel provides no calories, because the body can’t
metabolize it.) Wait: That number does not account for all the calories in the
serving. Remember, the foods listed here may also contain at least some pro-
tein and fat, and these two nutrients add calories.
Some problems with carbohydrates
Some people have a hard time handling carbohydrates. For example, people
with Type 1 (“insulin dependent”) diabetes do not produce sufficient amounts
of insulin, the hormones needed to carry all the glucose produced from car-
bohydrates into body cells. As a result, the glucose continues to circulate in
the blood until it’s excreted through the kidneys. That’s why one way to tell
whether someone has diabetes is to test the level of sugar in that person’s
urine.
Other people can’t digest carbohydrates because their bodies lack the spe-
cific enzymes needed to break the bonds that hold a carbohydrate’s sugar
units together. For example, many (some say most) Asians, Africans, Middle
Easterners, South Americans, and Eastern, Central, or Southern Europeans
are deficient in lactase, the enzyme that splits lactose (milk sugar) into glu-
cose and galactose. If they drink milk or eat milk products, they end up with 
a lot of undigested lactose in their intestinal tracts. This undigested lactose
makes the bacteria living there happy as clams — but not the person who
owns the intestines: As bacteria feast on the undigested sugar, they excrete
waste products that give their host gas and cramps.
103
Chapter 8: Carbohydrates: A Complex Story

To avoid this anomaly, many national cuisines purposely are void of milk as
an ingredient. (Quick! Name one native Asian dish that’s made with milk. No,
coconut milk doesn’t count.) Does that mean people living in these countries
don’t get enough calcium? No. They simply substitute high-calcium foods
such as greens or soy products for milk.
A second solution for people who don’t make enough lactase is to use a predi-
gested milk product such as yogurt or buttermilk or sour cream, all made by
adding friendly bacteria that digest the milk (that is, break the lactose apart)
without spoiling it. Other solutions include lactose-free cheeses and enzyme-
treated milk.
Who needs extra carbohydrates?
The small amount of glucose in your blood and cells provides the energy you
need for your body’s daily activities. The 400 grams of glycogen stored in
your liver and muscles provides enough energy for ordinary bursts of extra
activity.
But what happens when you have to work harder or longer than that? For
example, what if you’re a long-distance athlete, which means that you use up
your available supply of glucose before you finish your competition? (That’s
why marathoners often run out of gas — a phenomenon called hitting the 
wall — at 20 miles, six miles short of the finish line.)
If you were stuck on an ice floe or lost in the woods for a month or so, after
your body exhausts its supply of glucose, including the glucose stored in
glycogen, it starts pulling energy first out of fat and then out of muscle. But
extracting energy from body fat requires large amounts of oxygen — which 
is likely to be in short supply when your body has run, swum, or cycled 20
104
Part II: What You Get from Food 
Time out for the name game!
Here’s an interesting bit of nutritional informa-
tion. The names of all enzymes end in the letters
-ase. An enzyme that digests a specific sub-
stance in food often has a name similar to the
substance but with the letters -ase at the end.
For example, proteases are enzymes that digest
protein; lipases are enzymes that digest fats
(lipids); galactase is the enzyme that digests
galactose.

miles. So athletes have to find another way to leap the wall. Here it is: They
load up on carbohydrates in advance.
Carbohydrate-loading is a dietary regimen designed to increase temporarily
the amount of glycogen stored in your muscles in anticipation of an upcom-
ing event. You start about a week before the event, says the University of
Maine’s Alfred A. Bushway, Ph.D., exercising to exhaustion so your body pulls
as much glycogen as possible out of your muscles. Then, for three days, you
eat foods high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates to keep your
glycogen level from rising again.
Three days before the big day, reverse the pattern. Now you want to build
and conserve glycogen stores. What you need is a diet that’s about 70 per-
cent carbohydrates, providing 6 to 10 grams of carbohydrates for every kilo-
gram (2.2 pounds) of body weight for men and women alike. And not just any
carbohydrates, mind you. What you want are the complex carbohydrates in
starchy foods like pasta and potatoes, rather than the simple ones more
prominent in sugary foods like fruit. And of course, candy.
This carb-loading diet is not for everyday use, nor will it help people compet-
ing in events of short duration. It’s strictly for events lasting longer than 90
minutes.
What about while you’re running, swimming, or cycling? Will consuming
simple sugars during the race give you extra short-term bursts of energy?
Yes. Sugar is rapidly converted to glycogen and carried to the muscles. But
you don’t want straight sugar (candy, honey) because it’s hydrophilic (hydro =
water; philic = loving), which means that it pulls water from body tissues into
your intestinal tract. Using straight sugar can increase dehydration and make
you nauseated. Thus, getting the sugar you want from sweetened athletic
drinks, which provide fluids along with the energy, is best. The label on the
athletic drink also tells you the liquid contains salt (sodium chloride). Why?
To replace the salt that you lose when perspiring heavily. Turn to Chapter 13
to find out why this is important.
Dietary Fiber: The Non-Nutrient 
in Carbohydrate Foods
Dietary fiber is a group of complex carbohydrates that are not a source of
energy for human beings. Because human digestive enzymes cannot break
the bonds that hold fiber’s sugar units together, fiber adds no calories to
your diet and cannot be converted to glucose.
105
Chapter 8: Carbohydrates: A Complex Story

Ruminants (animals, such as cows, that chew the cud) have a combination of
digestive enzymes and digestive microbes that enable them to extract the
nutrients from insoluble dietary fiber (cellulose and some hemicelluloses).
But not even these creatures can pull nutrients out of lignin, an insoluble
fiber in plant stems and leaves and the predominant fiber in wood. As a
result, the U.S. Department of Agriculture specifically prohibits the use of
wood or sawdust in animal feed.
But just because you can’t digest dietary fiber doesn’t mean it isn’t a valuable
part of your diet. The opposite is true. Dietary fiber is valuable because you
can’t digest it!
The two kinds of dietary fiber
Nutritionists classify dietary fiber as either insoluble fiber or soluble fiber,
depending on whether it dissolves in water. (Both kinds of fiber resist human
digestive enzymes.)
 Insoluble fiber: This type of fiber includes cellulose, some hemicellu-
loses, and lignin found in whole grains and other plants. This kind of
dietary fiber is a natural laxative. It absorbs water, helps you feel full
after eating, and stimulates your intestinal walls to contract and relax.
These natural contractions, called peristalsis, move solid materials
through your digestive tract.
By moving food quickly through your intestines, insoluble fiber may
help relieve or prevent digestive disorders such as constipation or diver-
ticulitis (infection that occurs when food gets stuck in small pouches in
the wall of the colon). Insoluble fiber also bulks up stool and makes it
softer, reducing your risk of developing hemorrhoids and lessening the
discomfort if you already have them.
 Soluble fiber: This fiber, such as pectins in apples and beta-glucans in
oats and barley, seems to lower the amount of cholesterol circulating in
your blood (your cholesterol level). This tendency may be why a diet
rich in fiber appears to offer some protection against heart disease.
Here’s a benefit for dieters: Soluble fiber forms gels in the presence of water,
which is what happens when apples and oat bran reach your digestive tract.
Like insoluble fiber, soluble fiber can make you feel full without adding calories.
Ordinary soluble dietary fiber can’t be digested, so your body doesn’t absorb
it. But in 2002, researchers at Detroit’s Barbara Ann Karamonos Cancer
Institute fed laboratory mice a form of soluble dietary fiber called modified
citrus pectin. The fiber, which is made from citrus fruit peel, can be digested.
106
Part II: What You Get from Food 

When fed to laboratory rats, it appeared to reduce the size of tumors caused
by implanted human breast and colon cancer cells. The researchers believe
that the fiber prevents cancer cells from linking together to form tumors. Now,
two pharmaceutical companies — one on the East Coast and one on the West
Coast — are investigating the effects of modified citrus pectin in human beings.
But the product isn’t yet ready for prime time. Although it’s being sold as a
dietary supplement (not as a medicine), experts warn that its effects on human
bodies (and human cancers) remain unproven.
Getting fiber from food
You find fiber in all plant foods — fruits, vegetables, and grains. But you find
absolutely no fiber in foods from animals: meat, fish, poultry, milk, milk prod-
ucts, and eggs.
A balanced diet with lots of foods from plants gives you both insoluble and
soluble fiber. Most foods that contain fiber have both kinds, although the bal-
ance usually tilts toward one or the other. For example, the predominant fiber
in an apple is pectin (a soluble fiber), but an apple peel also has some cellu-
lose, hemicellulose, and lignin.
Table 8-1 shows you which foods are particularly good sources of specific
kinds of fiber. A diet rich in plant foods (fruits, vegetables, grains) gives you
adequate amounts of dietary fiber.

Chapter 8: Carbohydrates: A Complex Story

How much fiber do you need?
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average American woman
gets about 12 grams of fiber a day from food; the average American man, 17
grams. Those figures are well below the new IOM (Institute of Medicine) recom-
mendations that I conveniently list here:
 25 grams a day for women younger than 50
 38 grams a day for men younger than 50
 21 grams a day for women older than 50
 30 grams a day for men older than 50
The amounts of dietary fiber recommended by IOM are believed to give you
the benefits you want without causing fiber-related — um — unpleasantries.
Unpleasantries? Like what? And how will you know if you’ve got them?
Trust me: If you eat more than enough fiber, your body will tell you right
away. All that roughage may irritate your intestinal tract, which will issue an
unmistakable protest in the form of intestinal gas or diarrhea. In extreme
cases, if you don’t drink enough liquids to moisten and soften the fiber you
eat so that it easily slides through your digestive tract, the dietary fiber may
form a mass that can end up as an intestinal obstruction (for more about
water, see Chapter 13).
If you decide to up the amount of fiber in your diet, follow this advice:
 Do so very gradually, a little bit more every day. That way you’re less
likely to experience intestinal distress. In other words, if your current
diet is heavy on no-fiber foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, milk,
and cheese, and low-fiber foods such as white bread and white rice,
don’t load up on bran cereal (35 grams dietary fiber per 3.5-ounce serv-
ing) or dried figs (9.3 grams per serving) all at once. Start by adding a
serving of cornflakes (2.0 grams dietary fiber) at breakfast, maybe an
apple (2.8 grams) at lunch, a pear (2.6 grams) at mid-afternoon, and a
half cup of baked beans (7.7 grams) at dinner. Four simple additions, and
already you’re up to 15 grams dietary fiber.
 Always check the nutrition label whenever you shop (for more about the
wonderfully informative guides, see Chapter 17). When choosing between
similar products, just take the one with the higher fiber content per serv-
ing. For example, white pita bread generally has about 1.6 grams dietary
fiber per serving. Whole wheat pita bread has 7.4 grams. From a fiber
standpoint, you know which works better for your body. Go for it!
 Get enough liquids. Dietary fiber is like a sponge. It sops up liquid, so
increasing your fiber intake may deprive your cells of the water they
108
Part II: What You Get from Food 

need to perform their daily work (for more about how your body uses
the water you drink, see Chapter 13). That’s why the American Academy
of Family Physicians (among others) suggests checking to make sure
you get plenty fluids when you consume more fiber. How much is
enough? Back to Chapter 13.
Table 8-2 shows the amounts of all types of dietary fiber — insoluble plus 
soluble — in a 100-gram (3.5-ounce) serving of specific foods. By the way,
nutritionists like to measure things in terms of 100-gram portions because
that makes comparing foods at a glance possible.
To find the amount of dietary fiber in your own serving, divide the gram total
for the food shown in Table 8-2 by 3.5 to get the grams per ounce, and then
multiply the result by the number of ounces in your portion. For example, if
you’re having 1 ounce of cereal, the customary serving of ready-to-eat break-
fast cereals, divide the gram total of dietary fiber by 3.5; then multiply by one.
If your slice of bread weighs 1⁄2 ounce, divide the gram total by 3.5; then multi-
ply the result by 0.5 (1⁄2).
Or — let’s get real! — you can look at the nutrition label on the side of the
package that gives the nutrients per portion.
Finally, the amounts on this chart are averages. Different brands of processed
products (breads, some cereals, cooked fruits, and vegetables) may have
more (or less) fiber per serving.
109
Chapter 8: Carbohydrates: A Complex Story
Fiber factoid
The amount of fiber in a serving of food may
depend on whether the food is raw or cooked.
For example, as you can see from Table 8-2, a
3.5-ounce serving of plain dried prunes has 7.2
grams of fiber while a 3.5-ounce serving of
stewed prunes has 6.6 grams of fiber.
Why? When you stew prunes, they plump up —
which means they absorb water. The water
adds weight but (obviously) no fiber. So a serv-
ing of prunes-plus-water has slightly less fiber
per ounce than a same-weight serving of plain
dried prunes.

Fiber and your heart:
The continuing saga of oat bran
Oat bran is the second chapter in the fiber fad
that started with wheat bran around 1980.
Wheat bran, the fiber in wheat, is rich in the
insoluble fibers cellulose and lignin. Oat bran’s
gee-whiz factor is the soluble fiber beta-
glucans. For more than 30 years, scientists have
known that eating foods high in soluble fiber
can lower your cholesterol, although nobody
knows exactly why. Fruits and vegetables
(especially dried beans) are high in soluble fiber,
but ounce for ounce, oats have more. In addi-
tion, beta-glucans are a more effective choles-
terol-buster than pectin and gum, which are the
soluble fibers in most fruits and vegetables.
By 1990, researchers at the University of Ken-
tucky reported that people who add 1⁄2 cup dry
oat bran (not oatmeal) to their regular daily diets
can lower their levels of low density lipoproteins
(LDLs), the particles that carry cholesterol into
your arteries, by as much as 25 percent (see
Chapter 7 for more on cholesterol).
Recently, scientists at the Medical School of
Northwestern University, funded by Quaker
Oats, enlisted 208 healthy volunteers whose
normal cholesterol readings averaged about
200 mg/dl for a study involving oat bran. The 
volunteers’ total cholesterol levels decreased
an average of 9.3 percent with a low-fat, low-
cholesterol diet supplemented by 2 ounces of
oats or oat bran every day. About one-third of the
cholesterol reduction was credited to the oats.
Oat cereal makers rounded the total loss to 10
percent, and the National Research Council
said that a 10 percent drop in cholesterol could
produce a 20 percent drop in the risk of a heart
attack.
Do I have to tell you what happened next?
Books on oat bran hit the bestseller list. Cheerios
elbowed Frosted Flakes aside to become the
number one cereal in America. And people
added oat bran to everything from bagels to
orange juice.
Today scientists know that although a little oat
bran can’t hurt, the link between oats and cho-
lesterol levels is no cure-all.
As a general rule, an adult whose cholesterol
level is higher than 250 mg/dl is considered to
be at high risk. A cholesterol reading between
200 and 250 mg/dl is considered moderately
risky. A cholesterol level below 200 mg/dl is con-
sidered pretty good. No, that’s not a technical
term, but you get the idea.
If your cholesterol level is above 250 mg/dl, low-
ering it by 10 percent through a diet that contains
oat bran may reduce your risk of heart attack
without the use of medication. If your cholesterol
level is lower than that to begin with, the effects
of oat bran are less dramatic. For example:
 If your cholesterol level is below 250 mg/dl,
a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet alone may
push it down 15 points into the moderately
risky range. Adding oats reduces it another
8 points but doesn’t take you into okey-
dokey territory, under 200 mg/dl.
 If your cholesterol is already low, say 199
mg/dl or less, a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet
plus oats may drop it to 180 mg/dl, but the
oats account for only 6 points of your loss.
Recognizing oat bran’s benefits, the Food and
Drug Administration now permits health claims
on oat product labels. For example, the product
label may say: “Soluble fiber from foods such as
oat bran, as part of a diet low in saturated fat
and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart
disease.”
By the way, the soluble pectin in apples and the
soluble beta-glucans (gums) in beans and peas
also lower cholesterol levels. The insoluble fiber
in wheat bran does not.

Alcohol: Another Form 
of Grape and Grain

 Digesting alcohol
 Revealing alcohol’s effect on your health
A
lcohol beverages are among mankind’s oldest home remedies and simple
pleasures, so highly regarded that the ancient Greeks and Romans called
wine a “gift from the gods,” and when the Gaels — early inhabitants of Scotland
and Ireland — first produced whiskey, they named it uisge beatha (whis-key-ba),
a combination of the words for “water” and “life.” Today, although you may
share their appreciation for the product, you know that alcohol beverages may
have risks as well as benefits.
By the way, throughout this chapter I refer to beverages made from alcohol
as “alcohol beverages.” Yes, I know most people probably think the correct
term is “alcoholic beverages,” but whenever I write or say those words, I get
an immediate image of tipsy beer bottles. Besides, you’ve heard of “milk bev-
erages” but not “milky” ones, or “cola beverages” but not “cola-y” ones. So do
please indulge me.
Revealing the Many Faces of Alcohol
When microorganisms (yeasts) digest (ferment) the sugars in carbohydrate
foods, they make two byproducts: a liquid and a gas. The gas is carbon diox-
ide. The liquid is ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol, the intoxicating ingredi-
ent in alcohol beverages.

This biochemical process is not an esoteric one. In fact, it happens in your
own kitchen every time you make yeast bread. Remember the faint, beer-like
odor in the air while the dough is rising? That odor is from the alcohol the
yeasts make as they chomp their way through the sugars in the flour. (Don’t
worry; the alcohol evaporates when you bake the bread.) As the yeasts digest
the sugars, they also produce carbon dioxide, which makes the bread rise.
From now on, whenever you see the word alcohol alone in this book, unless
otherwise noted, it means ethanol, the only alcohol used in alcohol bever-
ages. (Yes, yes, yes. That definition applies backward, too. If you find the
word alcohol in a previous chapter, it, too, means ethanol. Gee. Some people
are sooooooo picky.)
Examining How Alcohol 
Beverages Are Made
Alcohol beverages are produced either through fermentation or through a
combination of fermentation plus distillation.
Fermented alcohol products
Fermentation is a simple process in which yeasts or bacteria are added to car-
bohydrate foods such as corn, potatoes, rice, or wheat, which are used as
starting material. The yeasts digest the sugars in the food, leaving liquid
(alcohol); the liquid is filtered to remove the solids, and water is usually
added to dilute the alcohol, producing — voilà — an alcohol beverage.
114
Part II: What You Get from Food 
What other alcohols do you have in your home?
Ethanol is the only kind of alcohol used in food
and alcohol beverages, but it isn’t the only kind
of alcohol used in consumer products. Here are
the other alcohols that may be sitting on the
shelf in your bathroom or workshop (though you
definitely don’t want to drink them):
Methyl alcohol (methanol): This poisonous
alcohol made from wood is used as a chemical
solvent (a liquid that dissolves other chemicals).
Isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol): This poi-
sonous alcohol is made from propylene, a petro-
leum derivative.
Denatured alcohol: This product is alcohol plus
a chemical (denaturant) that makes it taste and
smell bad so you won’t drink the alcohol. Some
denaturants are poisonous.

Beer is made this way. So is wine. Kumiss, a fermented milk product, is
slightly different because it’s made by adding yeasts and friendly bacteria
called lactobacilli (lacto = milk) to mare’s milk. The microorganisms make
alcohol, but it isn’t separated from the milk, which turns into a fizzy fer-
mented beverage with no water added.
Distilled alcohol products
The second way to make an alcohol beverage is through distillation.
As with fermentation, yeasts are added to foods to make alcohol from sugars.
But yeasts can’t thrive in a place where the concentration of alcohol is higher
than 20 percent. To concentrate the alcohol and separate it from the rest of
the ingredients in the fermented liquid, distillers pour the fermented liquid
into a still, a large vat with a wide column-like tube on top. The still is heated
so that the alcohol, which boils at a lower temperature than everything else
in the vat, turns to vapor, which rises through the column on top of the still,
to be collected in containers where it condenses back into a liquid.
This alcohol, called neutral spirits, is the base for the alcohol beverages called
spirits or distilled spirits: gin, rum, tequila, whiskey, and vodka. Brandy is a
special product, a spirit distilled from wine. Fortified wines such as Port and
Sherry are wines with spirits added.
The foods used to make beverage alcohol
Beverage alcohol can be made from virtually any carbohydrate food. The
foods most commonly used are cereal grains, fruit, honey, molasses, or pota-
toes. All produce alcohol, but the alcohols have slightly different flavors and
colors. Table 9-1 shows you which foods are used to produce the different
kinds of alcohol beverages.
115
Chapter 9: Alcohol: Another Form of Grape and Grain
Check the spelling
Here’s an interesting consumer note: Whiskey
is spelled with an e if it’s made in North America
or Ireland, without an e — whisky — if it comes
from another country (Scotland is the best
example).
Why? Nobody knows for sure. But a reason-
able assumption is that the Scots may simply
have dropped the e to differentiate their distilled
spirits from the spirits distilled in Ireland.
Journeying to the United States, Irish immi-
grants brought their distillation methods and
their e with them, so theirs became the name for
whiskey made in America.

116
Part II: What You Get from Food 
On its own, alcohol provides energy (7 calories per gram) but no nutrients,
so distilled spirits, such as whiskey or plain, unflavored vodka serve up noth-
ing but calories. Beer, wine, cider, and other fermented beverages, such as
kumiss (fermented milk), contain some of the food from which they were
made, so they contain small amounts of proteins and carbohydrates, vita-
mins, and minerals.

How Much Alcohol Is in That Bottle?
No alcohol beverage is 100 percent alcohol. It’s alcohol plus water, and — if
it’s a wine or beer — some residue of the foods from which it was made.
The label on every bottle of wine and spirits shows the alcohol content as
alcohol by volume (ABV). (For reasons too complicated to discuss in fewer
than, say, 50 pages, beer containers may carry this information, but United
States law doesn’t require it.)

ABV measures the amount of alcohol as a percentage of all the liquid in the
container. For example, if your container holds 10 ounces of liquid and 1
ounce of that is alcohol, the product is 10 percent ABV — the alcohol content
divided by the total amount of liquid.
Proof — an older term that describes alcohol content —is two times the ABV.
For example, an alcohol beverage that is 10 percent alcohol by volume is 20
proof.
By the way, right now, alcohol beverages are the only entries in the food and
drink market sold without a Nutrition Facts label. The National Consumers
League and the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest are
petitioning the Food and Drug Administration to create an ingredients label for
alcohol beverages. The label would show the ingredients, the number of stan-
dard servings in the container, and the alcohol content and calorie count per
serving so you can compare products — and control what you drink. Smart. To
see the proposed label, visit nclnet.org/pressroom/alcoholfactspr.htm.
Moving Alcohol through Your Body
Other foods must be digested before being absorbed by your cells, but alco-
hol flows directly through your body’s membranes into your bloodstream,
which carries alcohol to nearly every organ in your body. Here’s a road map
to show you the route traveled by the alcohol in every drink you take.
Flowing down the hatch 
from mouth to stomach
Alcohol is an astringent; it coagulates proteins on the surface of the lining of
your mouth to make it “pucker.” Some alcohol is absorbed through the lining
of your mouth and throat, but most of the alcohol you drink spills into your
stomach, where an enzyme called gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) begins
to metabolize (digest) it.
How much alcohol dehydrogenase your body churns out is influenced by
your ethnicity and your gender. For example, Asians, Native Americans, and
Inuits appear to secrete less alcohol dehydrogenase than do most Caucasians,
and the average woman (regardless of her ethnicity) makes less ADH than the
average man does. As a result, more unmetabolized alcohol flows from their
tummies into their bloodstreams, and they’re likely to become tipsy on smaller
amounts of alcohol than an average Caucasian male would need to drink.
While you ponder that, the unmetabolized alcohol is flowing through your
stomach walls into your bloodstream and on to your small intestine.
117
Chapter 9: Alcohol: Another Form of Grape and Grain

Stopping for a short visit 
at the energy factory
Most of the alcohol you drink is absorbed through the duodenum (small intes-
tine), from which it flows through a large blood vessel (the portal vein) into
your liver. There, an enzyme similar to gastric ADH metabolizes the alcohol,
which is converted to energy by a coenzyme called nicotinamide adenine di-
nucleotide (NAD). NAD is also used to convert the glucose you get from other
carbohydrates to energy; while NAD is being used for alcohol, glucose con-
version grinds to a halt.
The normal, healthy liver can process about 1⁄2 ounce of pure alcohol (that’s 
6 to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of spirits) in an hour. The
rest flows on to your heart.
Taking time out for air
Entering your heart, alcohol reduces the force with which your heart muscle
contracts. You pump out slightly less blood for a few minutes, blood vessels
all over your body relax, and your blood pressure goes down temporarily.
The contractions soon return to normal, but the blood vessels may remain
relaxed and your blood pressure lower for as long as half an hour.
At the same time, alcohol flows in blood from your heart through your pul-
monary vein to your lungs. Now you breathe out a tiny bit of alcohol every
time you exhale, and your breath smells of liquor. Then the newly oxygenated,
still alcohol-laden blood flows back through the pulmonary artery to your
heart, and up and out through the aorta (the major artery that carries blood
out to your body).
Rising to the surface
In your blood, alcohol raises your level of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs),
although not necessarily the specific good ones that carry cholesterol out of
your body. (For more about lipoproteins, see Chapter 7.) Alcohol also makes
blood less likely to clot, temporarily reducing your risk of heart attack and
stroke.
Alcohol makes blood vessels expand, so more warm blood flows up from the
center of your body to the surface of the skin. You feel warmer for a while
and, if your skin is fair, you may flush and turn pink. (Asians, who — you may
remember from a few paragraphs back — tend to make less alcohol dehydro-
genase than do Caucasians, often experience a characteristic flushing when
118
Part II: What You Get from Food 

they drink even small amounts of alcohol.) At the same time, tiny amounts of
alcohol ooze out through your pores, and your perspiration smells of alcohol.
Encountering curves in the road
Alcohol is a sedative. When it reaches your brain, it slows the transmission of
impulses between nerve cells that control your ability to think and move.
That’s why your thinking may be fuzzy, your judgment impaired, your tongue
twisted, your vision blurred, and your muscles rubbery.
Do you feel a sudden urge to urinate? Alcohol reduces your brain’s produc-
tion of antidiuretic hormones, chemicals that keep you from making too much
urine. You may lose lots of liquid, plus vitamins and minerals. You also grow
very thirsty, and your urine may smell faintly of alcohol. This cycle continues
as long as you have alcohol circulating in your blood, or in other words, until
your liver can manage to produce enough ADH to metabolize all the alcohol
you’ve consumed. How long is that? Most people need an hour to metabolize
the amount of alcohol (1⁄2 ounce) in one drink. But that’s an average: Some
people have alcohol circulating in their blood for up to three hours after
taking a drink.
Alcohol and Health
Beverage alcohol has benefits as well as side effects. The benefits seem to be
linked to what is commonly called moderate drinking — no more than one
drink a day for a woman, two drinks a day for a man — consumed with food.
The risks generally appear to flow from alcohol abuse.
Moderate drinking: Some 
benefits, some risks
Moderate amounts of alcohol reduce stress, so it isn’t surprising that recent
well-designed scientific studies on large groups of men and women suggest
that moderate drinking is heart-healthy, protecting the cardiovascular system
(that’s science talk for heart and blood vessels). Here are some findings about
the cardiovascular benefits and some of the other things moderate drinking
can do for you:
 The American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Study 1 followed
more than one million Americans in 25 states for 12 years to find that
moderate alcohol intake had an “apparent protective effect on coronary
heart disease.” Translation: Men who drink moderately lower their risk
119
Chapter 9: Alcohol: Another Form of Grape and Grain

of heart attack. The risk is 21 percent lower for men who have one drink
a day than for men who never drink.
A similar analysis of data for nearly 600,000 women in the long-running
(Harvard) Nurses’ Health Study showed that women who drink occa-
sionally or have one drink a day are less likely to die of heart attack than
those who don’t drink at all.
 A 2003 study at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical
Medicine shows that men who drink moderately (two drinks a day) also
are less likely to die of clot-related stroke. But because alcohol reduces
blood clotting, it increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused
by bleeding in the brain). Sorry about that.
 According to researchers at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
laboratory at Beltsville, Maryland, moderate drinking may lower a
healthy older woman’s risk of developing diabetes.
 Contrary to popular opinion, a 15-year, 1,700-person heart disease 
study at the Institute of Preventive Medicine, Kommunehospitalet in
Copenhagen, Denmark, showed that older men and women who regu-
larly consumed up to 21 drinks of wine a week were less likely than tee-
totalers to develop Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.
Similarly, a recent 12-year, 1,488-person survey at Johns Hopkins University
in Maryland suggests that regular, moderate drinkers score better over
time than teetotalers do on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a
standard test for memory, reasoning, and decision making.
That’s the good news. Here’s the bad news: The same studies that applaud the
effects of moderate drinking on heart health are less reassuring about the rela-
tionship between alcohol and cancer: The American Cancer Society’s Cancer
Prevention Study 1 shows that people who take more than two drinks a day have
a higher incidence of cancer of the mouth and throat (esophagus). In addition;
 Researchers at the University of Oklahoma say that men who drink five
or more beers a day double their risk of rectal cancer.
 American Cancer Society statistics show a higher risk of breast cancer
among women who have more than three drinks a week, but newer stud-
ies suggest this effect may apply only to older women using hormone
replacement therapy.
The physical risks of alcohol abuse
Alcohol abuse is a term generally taken to mean drinking so much that it
interferes with your ability to have a normal, productive life. The short-term
effects of excessive drinking are well-known to one and all, especially to men
who may find that drinking too much decreases sexual desire and makes it
impossible to . . . well . . . perform. (No evidence suggests that excessive
drinking interferes with female orgasm.)
120
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Excessive drinking can also make you feel terrible the next day. The morning
after is not fiction. A hangover is a miserable physical fact:
 You’re thirsty because you lost excess water through copious urination.
 Your stomach hurts and you’re queasy because even small amounts of
alcohol irritate your stomach lining, causing it to secrete extra acid and
lots of histamine, the same immune system chemical that makes the skin
around a mosquito bite red and itchy.
 Your muscles ache and your head pounds because processing alcohol
through your liver requires an enzyme — nicotinamide adenine dinu-
cleotide (NAD) — normally used to convert lactic acid, a byproduct of
muscle activity, to other chemicals that can be used for energy. The
extra, unprocessed lactic acid piles up painfully in your muscles.
Alcoholism: An addiction disease
Alcoholics are people who can’t control their drinking. Untreated alcoholism
is a life-threatening disease that can lead to death either from an accident or
suicide (both are more common among heavy drinkers) or from a toxic reac-
tion (acute alcohol poisoning that paralyzes body organs, including the heart
and lungs) or malnutrition or liver damage (cirrhosis).
Alcoholism makes it extremely difficult for the body to get essential nutri-
ents. Here’s why:
 Alcohol depresses appetite.
 An alcoholic may substitute alcohol for food, getting calories but no
nutrients.
121
Chapter 9: Alcohol: Another Form of Grape and Grain
A lot and a little versus the middle
When scientists talk about the relationship
between alcohol and heart disease, the words
J-curve often pop up. What’s a J-curve? A sta-
tistical graph in the shape of the letter J.
In terms of heart disease, the lower peak on the
left of the J shows the risk among teetotalers,
the high spike on the right shows the risk among
those who drink too much, and the curve in the
center shows the risk in the moderate middle.
In other words, the J-curve says that people
who drink moderately have a lower risk of heart
disease than people who drink too much or not
at all.
That info’s nice. This is better: According to a
recent report from the Alberta (Canada) Alcohol
and Drug Abuse Commission, the J-curve may
also describe the relationship between alcohol
and stroke, alcohol and diabetes, alcohol and
bone loss, and alcohol and longevity. The simple
fact is that moderate drinkers appear to live
longer, healthier lives than either teetotalers or
alcohol abusers. Cheers!

 Even when the alcoholic eats, the alcohol in his or her tissues can pre-
vent the proper absorption of vitamins (notably the B vitamins), miner-
als, and other nutrients. Alcohol may also reduce the alcoholic’s ability
to synthesize proteins.
No one knows exactly why some people are able to have a drink once a day
or once a month or once a year, enjoy it, and move on, while others become
addicted to alcohol. In the past, alcoholism has been blamed on heredity
(bad genes), lack of willpower, or even a bad upbringing. But as science con-
tinues to unravel the mysteries of body chemistry, it’s reasonable to expect
that researchers will eventually come up with a rational scientific explanation
for the differences between social drinkers and people who can’t safely use
alcohol. It just hasn’t happened yet.
Who should not drink
No one should drink to excess. But some people shouldn’t drink at all, not
even in moderation. They include
 People who plan to drive or do work that requires both attention and
skill. Alcohol slows reaction time and makes your motor skills — turning
the wheel of the car, operating a sewing machine — less precise.
 Women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant in the near
future. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a collection of birth defects includ-
ing low birth weight, heart defects, retardation, and facial deformities doc-
umented only in babies born to female alcoholics. No evidence links FAS
to casual drinking — that is, one or two drinks during a pregnancy or even
one or two drinks a week. But the fact is that about 7 percent of the babies
born in the United States each year are born with birth defects indepen-
dent of any parental behavior. The parents of these children may feel
guilty, even though their behavior had absolutely nothing to do with the
birth defect. Your decision about alcohol should take into consideration
the possibility of (misplaced) lifelong guilt caused by having had a drink.
 People who take certain prescription drugs or over-the-counter med-
ication. Alcohol makes some drugs stronger, increases some drugs’ side
effects, and renders other drugs less effective. At the same time, some
drugs make alcohol a more powerful sedative or slow down the elimina-
tion of alcohol from your body.
Table 9-2 shows some of the interactions known to occur between alcohol
and some common prescription and over-the-counter drugs. This short list
gives you an idea of some of the general interactions likely to occur between
alcohol and drugs. But the list is far from complete, so if you’re taking any
122

Binge drinking: A behavioral no-no
Binge drinkers are “once-in-a-while alco-
holics.” They don’t drink every day, but when
they do indulge, they go so far overboard that
they sometimes fail to come back up. In simple
terms, binge drinking is downing very large
amounts of alcohol in a short time, not for a
pleasant lift but to get drunk. As a result, binge
drinkers may consume so much beer, wine, or
spirits that the amount of alcohol in their blood
rises to lethal levels, leading to death by alcohol
poisoning. Got the picture? Binge drinking is not
a sport. It’s potentially fatal behavior. Don’t do it.

Heeding Advice from the Sages:
Moderation
Good advice is always current. The folks who wrote Ecclesiastes (a book in
the Bible) centuries ago may have been speaking to you when they said,
“Wine is as good as life to man if it be drunk moderately.” And it’s impossible
to improve on this slogan from the Romans (actually, one Roman writer
named Terence): “Moderation in all things.” Hey, you can’t get a message
more direct — or more sensible — than that.

The power of purple (and peanuts)
Grape skin, pulp, and seeds contain resveratrol,
a naturally occurring plant chemical that seems
to reduce the risk of heart disease and some
kinds of cancer. The darker the grapes, the
higher the concentration of resveratrol.
Dark purple grape juice, for example, has more
resveratrol than red grape juice, which has
more resveratrol than white grape juice.
Because wine is made from grapes, it, too, con-
tains resveratrol (red wine has more resveratrol
than white wine).
But you don’t need to drink grape juice or wine
to get resveratrol. You can simply snack on
peanuts. Yes, peanuts. A 1998 analysis from the
USDA Agricultural Research Service in Raleigh,
North Carolina, showed that peanuts have 1.7 to
3.7 micrograms of resveratrol per gram of nuts.
Compare that to the 0.7 micrograms of resvera-
trol in a glass of red grape juice or 0.6 to 8.0
micrograms of resveratrol per gram of red wine.
This fact may explain data from the long-
running Harvard University/Brigham and
Women’s Hospital Nurses’ Health Study, which
shows that women who eat an ounce of nuts a
day have a lower risk of heart disease. So let’s
see — wine, grape juice, peanuts . . . decisions,
decisions.

V
itamins are organic chemicals, substances that contain carbon, hydro-
gen, and oxygen. They occur naturally in all living things, plants and ani-
mals alike: flowers, trees, fruits, vegetables, chickens, fish, cows — and you.
Vitamins regulate a variety of bodily functions. They’re essential for building
body tissues such as bones, skin, glands, nerves, and blood. They assist in
metabolizing (digesting) proteins, fats, and carbohydrates so that you can get
energy from food. They prevent nutritional deficiency diseases, promote heal-
ing, and encourage good health.
This chapter is a guide to where the vitamins are, how you can add them to
your diet, how to tell how much is more than enough of any specific vitamin,
and ever so much more . . . maybe more than you really want to know.
Taking a Look at the Vitamins 
Your Body Needs
Your body needs at least 11 specific vitamins: vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E,
vitamin K, vitamin C, and the members of the B vitamin family: thiamin (vita-
min B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin, vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12. Two more
B vitamins — biotin and pantothenic acid — are now believed valuable to
your well-being as well. And one unusual compound called choline has recently
received some favorable mention (more about it in the “Choline” section later
in this chapter). You need only miniscule quantities of vitamins for good
health. In some cases, the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs), deter-
mined by the National Research Council, may be as small as several micro-
grams (1⁄1,000,000 – that’s one one-millionth — of a gram).

Nutritionists classify vitamins as either fat soluble or water soluble, meaning
that they dissolve either in fat or in water. If you consume larger amounts of
fat-soluble vitamins than your body needs, the excess is stored in body fat.
Excess water-soluble vitamins are eliminated in urine.
Large amounts of fat-soluble vitamins stored in your body may cause prob-
lems (see the section “Fat-soluble vitamins” in this chapter). With water-
soluble vitamins, your body simply shrugs its shoulders, so to speak, and uri-
nates away most of the excess.
Medical students often use mnemonic devices — memory joggers — to
remember complicated lists of body parts and symptoms of diseases. Here’s
one I use to remember which vitamins are fat-soluble: “All Dogs Eat Kidneys.”
This saying helps me remember that vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble.
All the rest dissolve in water.
Fat-soluble vitamins
Vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K are relatives that have two
characteristics in common: All dissolve in fat, and all are stored in your fatty
tissues. But like members of any family, they also have distinct personalities.
One keeps your skin moist. Another protects your bones. A third keeps repro-
ductive organs purring happily. And the fourth enables you to make special
proteins.

Part II: What You Get from Food 
The father of all vitamins: Casimir Funk
Vitamins are so much a part of modern life you
may have a hard time believing they were first
discovered less than a century ago. Of course,
people have long known that certain foods con-
tain something special. For example, the ancient
Greek physician Hippocrates prescribed liver
for night-blindness (the inability to see well in
dim light). By the end of the 18th century (1795),
British Navy ships carried a mandatory supply
of limes or lime juice to prevent scurvy among
the men, thus earning the Brits once and forever
the nickname limeys. Later on, the Japanese
Navy gave its sailors whole grain barley to ward
off beriberi.
Everyone knew these prescriptions worked, 
but nobody knew why — until 1912, when
Casimir Funk (1884–1967), a Polish biochemist
working first in England and then in the United
States, identified “somethings” in food that he
called vitamines (vita = life; amines = nitrogen
compounds).
The following year, Funk and a fellow bio-
chemist, Briton Frederick Hopkins, suggested
that some medical conditions such as scurvy
and beriberi were simply deficiency diseases
caused by the absence of a specific nutrient in
the body. Adding a food with the missing nutri-
ent to one’s diet would prevent or cure the defi-
ciency disease.
Eureka!

Which does what? Read on.
Vitamin A
Vitamin A is the moisturizing nutrient that keeps your skin and mucous mem-
branes (the slick tissue that lines the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, vagina, and
rectum) smooth and supple. Vitamin A is also the vision vitamin, a con-
stituent of 11-cis retinol, a protein in the rods (cells in the back of your eye
that enable you to see even when the lights are low) that prevents or slows
the development of age-related macular degeneration, or progressive damage
to the retina of the eye, which can cause the loss of central vision (the ability
to see clearly enough to read or do fine work). Finally, vitamin A promotes
the growth of healthy bones and teeth, keeps your reproductive system hum-
ming, and encourages your immune system to churn out the cells you need
to fight off infection.
Two chemicals provide vitamin A: retinoids and carotenoids. Retinoids are
compounds whose names all start with ret: retinol, retinaldehyde, retinoic
acid, and so on. These fat-soluble substances are found in several foods of
animal origin: liver (again!) and whole milk, eggs, and butter. Retinoids give
you preformed vitamin A, the kind of nutrient your body can use right away.
The second form of vitamin A is the vitamin A precursor, a chemical such as
beta-carotene, a deep yellow carotenoid (pigment) found in dark green and
bright yellow fruits and vegetables. Your body transforms a vitamin A precur-
sor into a retinol-like substance. So far, scientists have identified at least 500
different carotenoids. Only 1 in 10 — about 50 altogether — are considered,
like beta-carotene, to be sources of vitamin A.
127
Chapter 10: Vigorous Vitamins
Help! I’m turning orange
Because you store retinol in your liver, mega-
doses of preformed vitamin A can build up to
toxic levels. Not so with carotenoids, which
serve up another form of that vitamin. They
aren’t stored in the liver, so these red and yellow
pigments in fruits and vegetables are safe even
in very large amounts.
But that doesn’t mean that excess carotenoids
don’t have side effects. Carotenoids, like
retinoids, are stored in body fat. If you wolf
down large quantities of carotenoid-rich foods
like carrots and tomatoes every day, day after
day, for several weeks, your skin — particularly
the palms of your hands and the soles of your
feet — will turn a nifty shade of dusty orange,
brighter if your skin is naturally light, darker if it’s
naturally dark. It sounds fantastic, but it has
actually happened to people eating two cups of
carrots and two whole tomatoes a day for sev-
eral months. When they cut down on the carrots
and tomatoes, the color faded.
Now, let’s see . . . it’s September 1, and you’ve
been invited to a Halloween party. Maybe this
year you’ll go as a pumpkin. If you start packing
in the carrots and tomatoes right now. . . .

Traditionally, the recommended dietary allowances of vitamin A are mea-
sured in International Units (IU). However, because retinol is the most effi-
cient source of vitamin A, the modern way to measure the RDA for vitamin A
is as retinol equivalents, abbreviated as RE. One microgram (mcg) RE = 3.3 IU.
However, many vitamin products still list the RDA for vitamin A in IUs.
Vitamin D
If I say “bones” or “teeth,” what nutrient springs most quickly to mind? If you
answer calcium, you’re giving only a partial picture. True, calcium is essential
for hardening teeth and bones. But no matter how much calcium you consume,
without vitamin D, your body can’t absorb and use the mineral. So vitamin D
is vital for building — and holding — strong bones and teeth.
Researchers at the Bone Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston say
vitamin D may also reduce the risk of tooth loss by preventing the inflamma-
tory response that leads to periodontal disease, a condition that destroys the

Hand in hand: How vitamins help each other
All vitamins have specific jobs in your body.
Some have partners. Here are some examples
of nutrient cooperation:
 Vitamin E keeps vitamin A from being
destroyed in your intestines.
 Vitamin D enables your body to absorb cal-
cium and phosphorus.
 Vitamin C helps folate build proteins.
 Vitamin B1 works in digestive enzyme sys-
tems with niacin, pantothenic acid, and
magnesium.
Taking vitamins with other vitamins may also
improve body levels of nutrients. For example,
in 1993, scientists at the National Cancer
Institute and the U. S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Agricultural Research Service gave one
group of volunteers a vitamin E capsule plus a
multivitamin pill; a second group, vitamin E
alone; and a third group, no vitamins at all. The
people getting vitamin E plus the multivitamin
had the highest amount of vitamin E in their
blood — more than twice as high as those who
took plain vitamin E capsules.
Sometimes, one vitamin may even alleviate a
deficiency caused by the lack of another vita-
min. People who do not get enough folate are at
risk of a form of anemia in which their red blood
cells fail to mature. As soon as they get folate,
either by injection or by mouth, they begin
making new healthy cells. That’s to be expected.
What’s surprising is the fact that anemia caused
by pellagra, the niacin deficiency disease, may
also respond to folate treatment.
Isn’t nature neat?

thin tissue (ligaments) that connects the teeth to the surrounding jawbone.
Finally, a report in the February 2006 issue of The American Journal of Public
Health suggests that taking 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day
may cut in half a person’s risk of developing some forms of cancer, including
cancer of the colon, breast, or ovaries.
Vitamin D comes in three forms: calciferol, cholecalciferol, and ergocalciferol.
Calciferol occurs naturally in fish oils and egg yolk. In the United States, it’s
added to margarines and milk. Cholecalciferol is created when sunlight hits
your skin and ultraviolet rays react with steroid chemicals in body fat just
underneath. Ergocalciferol is synthesized in plants exposed to sunlight.
Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol justify vitamin D’s nickname: the Sunshine
Vitamin.
The RDA for vitamin D is measured either in International Units (IUs) or micro-
grams (mcg) of cholecalciferol: 10 mcg cholecalciferol = 400 IU vitamin D.
Vitamin E
Every animal, including you, needs vitamin E to maintain a healthy reproduc-
tive system, nerves, and muscles. You get vitamin E from tocopherols and
tocotrienols, two families of naturally occurring chemicals in vegetable oils,
nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables — your best natural sources of
vitamin E.
Tocopherols, the more important source, have two sterling characteristics:
They’re anticoagulants and antioxidants that reduce blood’s ability to clot,
thus reducing the risk of clot-related stroke and heart attack. Antioxidants
prevent free radicals (incomplete pieces of molecules) from hooking up with
other molecules or fragments of molecules to form toxic substances that can
attack tissues in your body. In fact, nutrition scientists at Purdue University
released a study showing that vitamin E promotes bone growth by stopping
free radicals from reacting with polyunsaturated fatty acids (see Chapter 7
for information on fats) to create molecules that interfere with the formation
of new bone cells.
But some claims about E’s heart health benefits are now considered iffy. True,
a recent clinical trial at Cambridge University in England showed that taking
800 IU (International Units) of vitamin E, two times the RDA, may reduce the
risk of nonfatal heart attacks for people who already have heart disease. And,
yes, the federal Women’s Health Study found that older women taking 600 IU
vitamin E per day had a lower risk of heart attack and a lower risk of death
from heart disease. But the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)
study showed no such benefits. In fact, people taking 400 IU per day vitamin E
were more likely to develop heart failure. No one (and no study) has found
similar problems among those taking less vitamin E, say 100 IU/day. Whew.
129
Chapter 10: Vigorous Vitamins

The best sources of vitamin E are vegetables, oils, nuts, and seeds. The RDA
is expressed as milligrams a-tocopherol equivalents (abbreviated as a-TE).
Vitamin K
Vitamin K is a group of chemicals that your body uses to make specialized
proteins found in blood plasma (the clear fluid in blood), such as prothrom-
bin, the protein chiefly responsible for blood clotting. You also need vitamin
K to make bone and kidney tissues. Like vitamin D, vitamin K is essential for
healthy bones. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption; vitamin K activates
at least three different proteins that take part in forming new bone cells. For
example, a report on 888 men and women from the long-running Framingham
(Massachusetts) Heart Study shows that those who consumed the least vita-
min K each day had the highest incidence of broken bones. The same was
true for a 1999 analysis of data from the Nurses’ Health Study.
Vitamin K is found in dark green leafy vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale, let-
tuce, spinach, and turnip greens), cheese, liver, cereals, and fruits, but most
of what you need comes from resident colonies of friendly bacteria in your
intestines, an assembly line of busy bugs churning out the vitamin day and
night.
Water-soluble vitamins
Vitamin C and the entire roster of B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vita-
min B6, folate, biotin, and pantothenic acid) are usually grouped together
simply because they all dissolve in water.
130
Part II: What You Get from Food 
PQQ, a whole new itty-bitty vitamin
The next time someone tells you to mind your p’s
and q’s, don’t take offense. The subject may be
nutrition, not manners — pyrroloquinoline
quinone (PQQ), the first new vitamin in more
than half a century. The water-soluble com-
pound, identified at the University of Texas in
1979 and labeled a vitamin four years later by
researchers at Tokyo’s Institute of Physical 
and Chemical Research, is widely available in
plant foods such as green tea, green bell pep-
pers, papaya, spinach, carrots, cabbage, and
bananas. Animal studies show a connection
between PQQ and an enzyme used by mammals
to digest lysine, an amino acid found in proteins.
The vitamin is essential for some bacteria and
maybe even mice. And you? Well, if you need it,
you need very, very little. The amounts of other
vitamins are measured in milligrams (thou-
sandths of a gram) or micrograms (millionths of
a gram). But PQQ is measured in nanograms
(billionths of a gram) — 1/1,000,000,000.Which is
about as itty-bitty as it gets.

The ability to dissolve in water is an important point, because that means
large amounts of these nutrients can’t be stored in your body. If you take in
more than you need to perform specific bodily tasks, you will simply pee
away virtually all the excess. The good news is that these vitamins rarely
cause side effects. The bad news is that you have to take enough of these vit-
amins every day to protect yourself against deficiencies.
Vitamin C
Vitamin C, which also is referred to as ascorbic acid, is essential for the
development and maintenance of connective tissue (the fat, muscle, and
bone framework of the human body). Vitamin C speeds the production of
new cells in wound healing, protects your immune system, helps you fight off
infection, reduces the severity of allergic reactions, and plays a role in the
syntheses of hormones and other body chemicals. For more on this impor-
tant nutrient, see the sidebar “A special case: The continuing saga of Vitamin
C,” further on in this chapter.
Thiamin (vitamin B1)
Call it thiamin. Call it B1. Just don’t call it late for lunch (or any other meal).
This sulfur (thia) and nitrogen (amin) compound, the first of the B vitamins
to be isolated and identified, helps ensure a healthy appetite. It acts as a
coenzyme (a substance that works along with other enzymes) essential to at
least four different processes by which your body extracts energy from car-
bohydrates. And thiamin also is a mild diuretic (something that makes you
urinate more).
Although thiamin is found in every body tissue, the highest concentrations
are in your vital organs — heart, liver, and kidneys.
The richest dietary sources of thiamin are unrefined cereals and grains, lean
pork, beans, nuts, and seeds. In the United States, refined flours, stripped of
their thiamin, are a nutritional reality, so most Americans get most of their
thiamin from breads and cereals enriched with additional B1.
Riboflavin (vitamin B2)
Riboflavin (vitamin B2), the second B vitamin to be identified, was once
called “vitamin G.” Its present name is derivative of its chemical structure, a
carbon-hydrogen-oxygen skeleton that includes ribitol (a sugar) attached to a
flavonoid (a substance from plants containing a pigment called flavone).
Like thiamin, riboflavin is a coenzyme. Without it, your body can’t digest and
use proteins and carbohydrates. Like vitamin A, it protects the health of
mucous membranes — the moist tissues that line the eyes, mouth, nose,
throat, vagina, and rectum.
131
Chapter 10: Vigorous Vitamins

You get riboflavin from foods of animal origin (meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and
milk), whole or enriched grain products, brewer’s yeast, and dark green veg-
etables (like broccoli and spinach).
Niacin
Niacin is one name for a pair of naturally occurring nutrients, nicotinic acid
and nicotinamide. Niacin is essential for proper growth, and like other B vita-
mins, it’s intimately involved in enzyme reactions. In fact, it’s an integral part of
an enzyme that enables oxygen to flow into body tissues. Like thiamin, it gives
you a healthy appetite and participates in the metabolism of sugars and fats.
Niacin is available either as a preformed nutrient or via the conversion of 
the amino acid tryptophan. Preformed niacin comes from meat; tryptophan
comes from milk and dairy foods. Some niacin is present in grains, but your
body can’t absorb it efficiently unless the grain has been treated with lime —
the mineral, not the fruit. This is a common practice in Central American and
South American countries, where lime is added to cornmeal in making tor-
tillas. In the United States, breads and cereals are routinely fortified with
niacin. Your body easily absorbs the added niacin.
The term used to describe the niacin RDA is NE (niacin equivalent): 60 mil-
ligrams tryptophan = 1 milligram niacin = 1 niacin equivalent (NE).
Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)
Vitamin B6 is another multiple compound, this one comprising three related
chemicals: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. Vitamin B6, a component
132
Part II: What You Get from Food 
Lemons, limes, oranges — and bacon?
Check the meat label. Right there it is, plain as
day — vitamin C in the form of sodium ascor-
bate or isoascorbate.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it
has to be there because vitamin C does for meat
exactly what it does for your body: It prevents
free radicals (incomplete pieces of molecules)
from hooking up with each other to form dam-
aging compounds, in this case carcinogens,
substances that cause cancer.
Processed meats such as bacon and sausages
are preserved with sodium nitrite, which protects
the meat from Clostridium botulinum, micro-
organisms that cause the potentially fatal food
poisoning known as botulism.
On its own, sodium nitrite reacts at high tem-
peratures with compounds in meat to form car-
cinogens called nitrosamines. But like the Lone
Ranger, antioxidant vitamin C rides to the
rescue, preventing the chemical reaction and
keeping the sausage and bacon safe to eat.
How’s that for healthy eating, Kemo Sabe?

of enzymes that metabolizes proteins and fats, is essential for getting energy
and nutrients from food. It also helps lower blood levels of homocysteine (see
Chapter 6), an amino acid produced when you digest proteins. The American
Heart Association calls a high level of homocysteine an independent (but 
not major) risk factor for heart disease, and the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition reported in 2005 that a high homocysteine level may be associated
with an age-related decline in memory. Alas, follow up studies show no reduc-
tion in the risk of heart disease or improvement in memory in those who
reduce their blood levels of homocysteine.
The best food sources of vitamin B6 are liver, chicken, fish, pork, lamb, milk,
eggs, unmilled rice, whole grains, soybeans, potatoes, beans, nuts, seeds, and
dark green vegetables such as turnip greens. In the United States, bread and
other products made with refined grains have added vitamin B6.
Folate
Folate, or folic acid, is an essential nutrient for human beings and other verte-
brates (animals with backbones). Folate takes part in the synthesis of DNA,
the metabolism of proteins, and the subsequent synthesis of amino acids
used to produce new body cells and tissues. Folate is vital for normal growth
and wound healing. An adequate supply of the vitamin is essential for pregnant
women to enable them to create new maternal tissue as well as fetal tissue. In
addition, an adequate supply of folate dramatically reduces the risk of spinal
cord birth defects. Beans, dark green leafy vegetables, liver, yeast, and various
fruits are excellent food sources of folate, and all multivitamin supplements
must now provide 400 mcg of folate per dose.
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) makes healthy red blood cells. Vitamin B12
protects myelin, the fatty material that covers your nerves and enables you
to transmit electrical impulses (messages) between nerve cells. These mes-
sages make it possible for you to see, hear, think, move, and do all the things
a healthy body does each day. In 2005, the Canadian Medical Association
Journal reported that low blood levels of B12 in older people are linked to
higher levels of homocysteine (a minor risk factor for heart disease; see pre-
vious, “Vitamin B6 [Pyridoxine]”).
Vitamin B12 is unique. First, it’s the only vitamin that contains a mineral,
cobalt. (Cyanocobalamin, a cobalt compound, is commonly used as “vitamin
B12” in vitamin pills and nutritional supplements.) Second, it’s a vitamin that
can’t be made by higher plants (the ones that give us fruits and vegetables).
Like vitamin K, vitamin B12 is made by beneficial bacteria living in your small
intestine. Meat, fish, poultry, milk products, and eggs are good sources of 
vitamin B12. Grains don’t naturally contain vitamin B12, but like other B vita-
mins, it’s added to grain products in the United States.
133
Chapter 10: Vigorous Vitamins

Biotin
Biotin is a B-vitamin, a component of enzymes that ferry carbon and oxygen
atoms between cells. Biotin helps you metabolize fats and carbohydrates and
is essential for synthesizing fatty acids and amino acids needed for healthy
growth. And it seems to prevent a buildup of fat deposits that may interfere
with the proper functioning of liver and kidneys. (No, biotin won’t keep fat
from settling in more visible places, such as your hips.)
The best food sources of biotin are liver, egg yolk, yeast, nuts, and beans. If
your diet doesn’t give you all the biotin you need, bacteria in your gut will
synthesize enough to make up the difference. No RDA exists for biotin, but
the Food and Nutrition Board has established an Adequate Intake (AI), which
means a safe and effective daily dose.
Pantothenic acid
Pantothenic acid, another B-vitamin, is vital to enzyme reactions that enable
you to use carbohydrates and create steroid biochemicals such as hormones.
Pantothenic acid also helps stabilize blood sugar levels, defends against infec-
tion, and protects hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries
oxygen through the body), as well as nerve, brain, and muscle tissue. You get
pantothenic acid from meat, fish and poultry, beans, whole grain cereals, and
fortified grain products. As with biotin, the Food and Nutrition Board has
established an Adequate Intake (AI) for pantothenic acid.
Choline
Choline is not a vitamin, a mineral, a protein, a carbohydrate, or a fat, but it’s
usually lumped in with the B-vitamins, so heeeeere’s choline!
In 1998, 138 years after this nutrient first was identified, the Institute of
Medicine (IOM) finally declared it essential for human beings. The IOM had
good reasons for doing so. Choline keeps body cells healthy. It’s used to
make acetylcholine, a chemical that enables brain cells to exchange mes-
sages. It protects the heart and lowers the risk of liver cancer. And new
research at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) shows that choline
plays a role in developing and maintaining the ability to think and remember,
at least among rat pups and other beasties born to lab animals that were
given choline supplements while pregnant. Follow-up studies showed that
prenatal choline supplements helped the animals grow bigger brain cells.
True, no one knows whether this would also be true for human pups, er,
babies, but some researchers advise pregnant women to eat a varied diet,
because getting choline from basic stuff like eggs, meat, and milk is so easy.
IOM’s Food and Nutrition Board, the group that sets the RDAs, has established
an AI (Adequate Intake) for choline.

One reasonable set of guidelines for good nutrition is the list of Recommended
Dietary Allowances (RDAs) established by the National Research Council’s
Food and Nutrition Board. The RDAs present safe and effective doses for
healthy people.
You can find the chart of RDAs for adults (ages 19 and up) in Chapter 4. It’s
very, very long, with RDAs for 10 different groups of people (men, women,
old, young) for 25 specific vitamins and minerals, plus choline. I couldn’t pos-
sibly ask you to read through it here. Personally, just the thought of retyping
the whole thing gives me hives.
Table 10-1 is the easy alternative: It gives you the RDAs for adult men and
women (ages 19 to 50) plus a quick, no-brainer guide to food portions that
give you at least 25 percent of the recommended dietary allowances of vita-
mins for healthy adult men and women, ages 25 to 50.
Photocopy this chart. Pin it on your fridge. Tape it to your organizer or
appointment book. Stick it in your wallet. Think of it as the truly simple way
to see how easy it is to eat healthy.

Too Much or Too Little: Avoiding Two
Ways to Go Wrong with Vitamins
RDAs are broad enough to prevent vitamin deficiencies and avoid the side
effects associated with very large doses of some vitamins. If your diet doesn’t
meet these guidelines, or if you take very large amounts of vitamins as sup-
plements, you may be in for trouble.
Vitamin deficiencies
The good news is that vitamin deficiencies are rare among people who have
access to a wide variety of foods and know how to put together a balanced
diet. For example, the only people likely to experience a vitamin E deficiency
are premature and/or low–birth weight infants and people with a metabolic dis-
order that keeps them from absorbing fat. A healthy adult may go as long as 10
years on a vitamin E–deficient diet without developing any signs of a problem.
Aha, you say, but what’s this subclinical deficiency I hear so much about?
Nutritionists use the term subclinical deficiency to describe a nutritional
deficit not yet far enough advanced to produce obvious symptoms. In lay
terms, however, the phrase has become a handy explanation for common but
hard-to-pin-down symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, nervousness, emo-
tional depression, allergies, and insomnia. And it’s a dandy way to increase
the sale of nutritional supplements.
Simply put, the RDAs protect you against deficiency. If your odd symptoms
linger even after you take reasonable amounts of vitamin supplements, prob-
ably something other than a lack of any one vitamin is to blame. Don’t wait
until your patience or your bank account has been exhausted to find out. Get
a second opinion as soon as you can. Table 10-2 lists the symptoms of vari-
ous vitamin deficiencies.

A Diet Low in This Vitamin
May Produce These Signs of Deficiency
Vitamin D
In children: rickets (weak muscles, delayed tooth
development, and soft bones, all caused by the inabil-
ity to absorb minerals without vitamin D)In adults:
osteomalacia (soft, porous bones that fracture easily)
Vitamin E
Inability to absorb fat
Vitamin K
Blood fails to clot
Vitamin C

Thiamin (vitamin B1)
Poor appetite; unintended weight loss; upset stom-
ach; gastric upset (nausea, vomiting); mental depres-
sion; an inability to concentrate
Riboflavin (vitamin B2)
Inflamed mucous membranes, including cracked lips,
sore tongue and mouth, burning eyes; skin rashes;
anemia
Niacin

branes; mental confusion and/or dementia)
Vitamin B6

skin rashes; upset stomach; nerve damage (in
infants)
Folate
Anemia (immature red blood cells)
Vitamin B12
Pernicious anemia (destruction of red blood cells,
nerve damage, increased risk of stomach cancer
attributed to damaged stomach tissue,
neurological/psychiatric symptoms attributed to
nerve cell damage)
Biotin
Loss of appetite; upset stomach; pale, dry, scaly skin;
hair loss; emotional depression; skin rashes (in
infants younger than 6 months)
Big trouble: Vitamin megadoses
Can you get too much of a good thing? Darn right, you can. Some vitamins are
toxic when taken in the very large amounts popularly known as megadoses.
How much is a megadose? Nobody knows for sure. The general consensus,
however, is that a megadose is several times the RDA, but the term is so
142
Part II: What You Get from Food 

vague that it’s in neither my medical dictionary nor the dictionary on my
computer.
 Megadoses of vitamin A (as retinol) may cause symptoms that make you
think you have a brain tumor. Taken by a pregnant woman, megadoses
of vitamin A may damage the fetus.
 Megadoses of vitamin D may cause kidney stones and hard lumps of cal-
cium in soft tissue (muscles and organs).
 Megadoses of niacin (sometimes used to lower cholesterol levels) can
damage liver tissue.
 Megadoses of vitamin B6 can cause (temporary) damage to nerves in
arms and legs, fingers, and toes.
But here’s an interesting fact: With one exception, the likeliest way to get a
megadose of vitamins is to take supplements (see Chapter 5 for more on sup-
plements). It’s pretty much impossible for you to cram down enough food to
overdose on vitamins D, E, K, C, and all the Bs. Did you notice the exception?
Right: vitamin A. Liver and fish liver oils are concentrated sources of preformed
vitamin A (retinol), the potentially toxic form of vitamin A. Liver contains so
much retinol that early 20th century explorers to the South Pole made them-
selves sick on seal and whale liver. Cases of vitamin A toxicity also have been
reported among children given daily servings of chicken liver. (See Table 10-3
for more on vitamin A toxicity, this time from supplements.) On the other hand,
even very large doses of vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin
(vitamin B2), folate, vitamin B12, biotin, and pantothenic acid appear safe for
human beings. Table 10-3 lists the effects of vitamin overdoses.
Table 10-3
Amounts and Effects of Vitamin 
Overdoses for Healthy People
Vitamin
Overdose and Possible Effect
Vitamin A
15,000 to 25,000 IU retinol a day for adults (2,000 IU or 
more for children) may lead to liver damage, headache, vomit-
ing, abnormal vision, constipation, hair loss, loss of appetite,
low-grade fever, bone pain, sleep disorders, and dry skin and
mucous membranes. A pregnant woman who takes more than
10,000 IU a day doubles her risk of giving birth to a child with
birth defects.
Vitamin D
2,000 IU a day can cause irreversible damage to kidneys and
heart. Smaller doses may cause muscle weakness, headache,
nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, retarded physical growth,
and mental retardation in children, and fetal abnormalities.
(continued)
143
Chapter 10: Vigorous Vitamins

Table 10-3 (continued)
Vitamin
Overdose and Possible Effect
Vitamin E
Large amounts (more than 400 to 800 IU a day) may cause upset
stomach or dizziness.
Vitamin C
1,000 mg or higher may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, or con-
stipation.
Niacin
Doses higher than the RDA raise the production of liver
enzymes and blood levels of sugar and uric acid, leading to liver
damage and an increased risk of diabetes and gout.
Vitamin B6
Continued use of 50 mg or more a day may damage nerves in
arms, legs, hands, and feet. Some experts say the damage is
likely to be temporary; others say that it may be permanent.
Choline
Very high doses (14 to 37 times the adequate amount) have been
linked to vomiting, salivation, sweating, low blood pressure, 
and — ugh! — fishy body odor.
You may not have to go sky-high on vitamin A to run into trouble. In January
2003, new data from a long-running (30-year) study at University Hospital in
Uppsala (Sweden) suggested that taking a multivitamin with normal amounts
of vitamin A may weaken bones and raise the risk of hip fractures by as much
as 700 percent, a conclusion supported by data released in 2004 from the
long-running Nurses’ Health Study. A high blood level of retinol — from large
amounts of vitamin A from food or supplements — apparently inhibits spe-
cial cells that usually make new bone, revs up cells that destroy bone, and
interferes with vitamin D’s ability to help you absorb calcium. Of course, con-
firming studies are needed, but you can bet the debate about lowering the
amount of A in your favorite supplement will be vigorous. The new recom-
mendations for vitamin A are 700 RE/2,300 IU of vitamin A for women and 900
RE/3,000 IU for men, but many popular multivitamins still contain 750–1500
RE/2,500–5,000 IU. Oooops?
Exceeding the RDAs: Taking Extra
Vitamins as Needed
Who needs extra vitamins? Maybe you. The RDAs are designed to protect
healthy people from deficiencies, but sometimes the circumstances of your
life (or your lifestyle) mean that you need something extra. Are you taking
medication? Do you smoke? Are you on a restricted diet? Are you pregnant?
Are you a nursing mother? Are you approaching menopause? Answer “yes” to
any of these questions, and you may be a person who needs larger amounts
of vitamins than the RDAs provide.
144
Part II: What You Get from Food 

I’m taking medication
Many valuable medicines interact with vitamins. Some drugs increase or
decrease the effectiveness of vitamins; some vitamins increase or decrease
the effectiveness of drugs. For example, a woman who’s using birth control
pills may absorb less than the customary amount of the B vitamins. For more
about vitamin and drug interactions, see Chapter 25.
I’m a smoker
It’s a fact — you probably have abnormally low blood levels of vitamin C.
More trouble: Chemicals from tobacco smoke create more free radicals in
your body. Even the National Research Council, which is tough on vitamin
overdosing, says that regular smokers need to take about 66 percent more
vitamin C — up to 100 mg a day — than nonsmokers.
145
Chapter 10: Vigorous Vitamins
A special case: The continuing saga of vitamin C
In 1970, chemist Linus Pauling published Vitamin
C and the Common Cold, a small book (just about
100 pages) made weightier by the fact that
Pauling had not one, but two Nobel prizes on his
shelf — one for chemistry and one for peace.
Ever since, people have been fighting over
Pauling’s message that very large doses of vita-
min C — called gram dosesbecause they provide
more than 1,000 milligrams (1 gram) — prevent or
cure the common cold or his later (unfounded)
claim that these doses may also cure advanced
cancer.
Over the past decade, the argument has
switched to vitamin C’s reputed ability to protect
heart health. For example, an April 2004 report in
the Journal of the American College of Nutrition
said vitamin C could lower blood levels of CRP, an
inflammation-related protein that increases the
risk of heart disease. University of California,
Berkeley, researchers gave 160 healthy adult vol-
unteers either 500 milligrams vitamin C or a mix-
ture of antioxidant nutrients or a look-alike pill
with no nutrients once a day for two months. In
the end, the folks who got the vitamin C experi-
enced a 24 percent drop in CRP blood levels
versus a statistically insignificant 4.7 percent for
the cocktail and no change at all for those on the
placebo. Not surprisingly, UC epidemiologists
thought vitamin C may become an important aid
to heart health.
Unless, that is, you’re taking medicines to knock
down your “bad” cholesterol and boost the
“good” kind. As the American Heart Association
(AHA) Council on Nutrition Physical Activity and
Metabolism points out, when 20 volunteers in an
HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study were
given vitamin C supplements along with their
anti-cholesterol meds, they ended up with lower-
than-expected levels of heart healthy high den-
sity lipoproteins (HDLs). In another small study,
women taking antioxidant vitamins along with
post-menopausal estrogens were more likely
than those taking look-alike pills to die from their
heart disease.
Oh, well. Nothing’s perfect.

I never eat animals
On the other hand, if you’re nuts for veggies but follow a vegan diet — one that
shuns all foods from animals (including milk, cheese, eggs, and fish oils) — you
simply cannot get enough vitamin D without taking supplements. Vegans also
benefit from extra vitamin C because it increases their ability to absorb iron
from plant food. And vitamin B12–enriched grains or supplements are a must
to supply the nutrient found only in fish, poultry, milk, cheese, and eggs.
I’m a couch potato who plans 
to start working out
When you do head for the gym, take it slow, and take an extra dose of vita-
min E. A study at the USDA Center for Human Nutrition at Tufts University
(Boston) suggests that an 800 milligram vitamin E supplement every day for
the first month after you begin exercising minimizes muscle damage by pre-
venting reactions with free radicals (parts of molecules) that cause inflamma-
tion. After that, you’re on your own: The vitamin doesn’t help conditioned
athletes whose muscles have adapted to workout stress.
I’m pregnant
Keep in mind that “eating for two” means that you’re the sole source of nutri-
ents for the growing fetus, not that you need to double the amount of food
you eat. If you don’t get the vitamins you need, neither will your baby.
The RDAs for many nutrients are the same as those for women who aren’t
pregnant. But when you’re pregnant, you need extra
 Vitamin D: Every smidgen of vitamin D in a newborn’s body came from
his or her mom. If the mother doesn’t have enough D, neither will the
baby. Are vitamin pills the answer? Yes. And no. The qualifier is how
many pills, because although too little vitamin D can weaken a develop-
ing fetus, too much can cause birth defects. That’s why until new recom-
mendations for vitamin D are issued, the second important d-word is
“doctor.” As in, check with yours to see what’s right for you.
 Vitamin E: To create all that new tissue (the woman’s as well as the
baby’s), a pregnant woman needs an extra 2 a-TE each day, the approxi-
mate amount in one egg.
146
Part II: What You Get from Food 

 Vitamin C: The level of vitamin C in your blood falls as your vitamin C
flows across the placenta to your baby, who may — at some point in the
pregnancy — have vitamin C levels as much as 50 percent higher than
yours. So you need an extra 10 milligrams vitamin C each day (1⁄2 cup
cooked zucchini or 2 stalks of asparagus).
 Riboflavin (vitamin B2): To protect the baby against structural defects
such as cleft palate or a deformed heart, a pregnant woman needs an
extra 0.3 milligrams riboflavin each day (slightly less than 1 ounce of
ready-to-eat cereal).
 Folate: Folate protects the child against cleft palate and neural tube
(spinal cord) defects. As many as two of every 1,000 babies born each
year in the United States have a neural tube defect such as spina bifida
because their mothers didn’t get enough folate to meet the RDA stan-
dard. The accepted increase in folate for pregnant women has been 200
micrograms (slightly more than the amount in 8 ounces of orange juice).
But new studies show that taking 400 micrograms folate before becom-
ing pregnant and through the first two months of pregnancy significantly
lowers the risk of giving birth to a child with cleft palate. Taking 400
micrograms folate each day through an entire pregnancy reduces the
risk of neural tube defect.
 Vitamin B12: To meet the demands of the growing fetus, a pregnant
woman needs an extra 0.2 micrograms vitamin B12 each day (just 3
ounces of roast chicken).
I’m breast-feeding
You need extra vitamin A, vitamin E, thiamin, riboflavin, and folate to produce
sufficient quantities of nutritious breast milk, about 750 milliters (3⁄4 liter)
each day. You need extra vitamin D, vitamin C, and niacin as insurance to
replace the vitamins you lose — that is, the ones you transfer to your child
in your milk.
I’m approaching menopause
Information about the specific vitamin requirements of older women is as
hard to find as, well, information about the specific vitamin requirements
about older men. It’s enough to make you wonder what’s going on with the
people who set the RDAs. Don’t they know that everyone gets older? Right
now, just about all anybody can say for sure about the nutritional needs of
older women is that they require extra calcium to stem the natural loss of
147
Chapter 10: Vigorous Vitamins

bone that occurs when women reach menopause and their production of the
female hormone estrogen declines. They may also need extra vitamin D to
enable their bodies to absorb and use the calcium. Gender Bias Alert! No sim-
ilar studies are available for older men. But adding vitamin D supplements 
to calcium supplements increases bone density in older people. The current
RDA for vitamin D is set at 5 micrograms/200 IU for all adults, but the new 
AI (Adequate Intake) for vitamin D is 10 micrograms/400 IU for people ages 
51 to 70 and 15 micrograms/600 IU or more for people 71 and older. Some
researchers suggest that even these amounts may be too low to guarantee
maximum calcium absorption.
Check with your doctor before adding vitamin D supplements. In very large
amounts, this vitamin can be toxic.
I have very light skin or very dark skin
Sunlight — yes, plain old sunlight — transforms fats just under the surface of
your skin to vitamin D. So getting what you need should be a cinch, right? Not
necessarily. Getting enough vitamin D from sunlight is hard to do when you
have very light skin and avoid the sun for fear of skin cancer. Even more diffi-
cult is getting enough vitamin D when you have very dark skin, which acts as 
a kind of natural sunblock. When Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
researchers surveyed the vitamin D status of more than 2,000 African American
and Caucasian women ages 15 to 49, they found low body levels of vitamin D in
42 percent of the African American women and 4.2 percent of the Caucasian
women. Based on these numbers, Boston University researchers suggest that
the Recommended Dietary Amount for adults who don’t get enough sunlight
may be as much as four times the current recommended amount. Check this
out with your doctor; it’s very important news for women who are or hope to
be pregnant and need extra vitamin D (check back a few paragraphs for this
information).

M
inerals are elements, substances composed of only one kind of atom.
They’re inorganic (translation: They don’t contain the carbon, hydro-
gen, and oxygen atoms found in all organic compounds, including vitamins).
Minerals occur naturally in nonliving things such as rocks and metal ores.
Although minerals also are present in plants and animals, they’re imported:
Plants get minerals from soil; animals get minerals by eating plants.
Most minerals have names reflecting the places where they’re found or charac-
teristics such as their color. For example, the name calcium comes from calx,
the Greek word for “lime” (chalk), where calcium is found; chlorine comes from
chloros, the Greek word for “greenish-yellow,” which just happens to be the
color of the mineral. Other minerals, such as americium, curium, berkelium,
californium, fermium, and nobelium, are named for where they were found or
to honor an important scientist.
This chapter tells you which minerals your body requires to stay in tiptop
shape, where to find these minerals in food, and precisely how much of each
mineral a healthy person needs.
Taking Inventory of the 
Minerals You Need
Think of your body as a house. Vitamins (all about them in Chapter 10) are
like tiny little maids and butlers, scurrying about to turn on the lights and
make sure that the windows are closed to keep the heat from escaping.
Minerals are more sturdy stuff, the mortar and bricks that strengthen the
frame of the house and the current that keeps the lights running.

Nutritionists classify the minerals essential for human life as either major
minerals (including the principal electrolytes — see Chapter 13) or trace ele-
ments. Major minerals and trace elements are both minerals. The difference
between them, nutritionally speaking, is how much you have in your body
and how much you need to take in to maintain a steady supply.
Your body stores varying amounts of minerals but keeps more than 5 grams
(about 1⁄6 of an ounce) of each of the major minerals and principal electrolytes
on hand; you need to consume more than 100 milligrams a day of each major
mineral to maintain a steady supply and to make up for losses. You store less
than 5 grams of each trace element and need to take in less than 100 milli-
grams a day to stay even.
Some minerals interact with other minerals or with medical drugs. For exam-
ple, calcium binds tetracycline antibiotics into compounds your body can’t
break apart so that the antibiotic moves out of your digestive tract, unab-
sorbed and unused. That’s why your doctor warns you off milk and dairy
products when you’re taking this medicine. For more about interactions
between minerals and medicines, turn to Chapter 25.
Introducing the major minerals
The following major minerals are essential for human beings:
 Calcium
 Phosphorus
 Magnesium
 Sulfur
 Sodium
 Potassium
 Chloride
Note: Sodium, potassium, and chloride, also known as the principal elec-
trolytes, are covered in Chapter 13.
Although sulfur, a major mineral, is an essential nutrient for human beings,
it’s almost never included in nutritional books and/or charts. Why? Because
it’s an integral part of all proteins. Any diet that provides adequate protein
also provides adequate sulfur. (For more on proteins, bookmark this page
and turn back to Chapter 6.)
After you’ve checked out proteins, come on back to look at the major miner-
als in minute detail.
150
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Calcium
When you step on the scale in the morning, you can assume that about three
pounds of your body weight is calcium, most of it packed into your bones
and teeth.
Calcium is also present in extracellular fluid (the liquid around body cells),
where it performs the following duties:
 Regulating fluid balance by controlling the flow of water in and out of cells
 Enabling cells to send messages back and forth from one to another
 Keeping muscles moving smoothly and preventing cramping
An adequate amount of calcium is important for controlling high blood pres-
sure — and not only for the person who takes the calcium directly. At least one
study shows that when a pregnant woman gets a sufficient amount of calcium,
her baby’s blood pressure stays lower than average for at least the first seven
years of life, meaning a lower risk of developing high blood pressure later on.
Your best food sources of calcium are milk and dairy products, plus fish such
as canned sardines and salmon. Calcium also is found in dark green leafy veg-
etables, but the calcium in plant foods is bound into compounds that are less
easily absorbed by your body.
151
Chapter 11: Mighty Minerals
An elementary guide to minerals
The early Greeks thought that all material on
Earth was constructed of a combination of four
basic elements: earth, water, air, and fire. Wrong.
Centuries later, alchemists looking for the for-
mula for precious metals, such as gold, decided
that the essential elements were sulfur, salt, and
mercury. Wrong again.
In 1669, a group of German chemists isolated
phosphorus, the first mineral element to be accu-
rately identified. After that, things moved a bit
more swiftly. By the end of the 19th century, sci-
entists knew the names and chemical properties
of 82 elements. Today, 112 elements have been
identified.
The classic guide to chemical elements is the
periodic table, a chart devised in 1869 by Russian
chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907), for whom
mendelevium was named. The table was revised
by British physicist Henry Moseley (1887–1915),
who came up with the concept of atomic num-
bers, numbers based on the number of protons
(positively charged particles) in an elemental
atom.
The periodic table is a clean, crisp way of char-
acterizing the elements, and if you are now or
ever were a chemistry, physics, or premed stu-

Calcium: The bone team player
The toe bone’s connected to the foot bone. The
foot bone’s connected to the anklebone. The
anklebone’s connected to the knee bone. And
what holds them together all the way up to the
head bone is connected to your diet.
Like all body tissues, bones are constantly being
replenished. Old bone cells break down, and
new ones are born. Specialized cells called
osteoclasts start the process by boring tiny
holes into solid bone so that other specialized
cells, called osteoblasts, can refill the open
spaces with fresh bone. At that point, crystals
of calcium, the best-known dietary bone builder,
glom onto the network of new bone cells to
harden and strengthen the bone.
Calcium begins its work on your bones while
you’re still in your mother’s womb. But it’s not the
only mineral at play. You should also think zinc.
Based on a survey of 242 pregnant women in
Peru, where zinc deficiency is common, Johns
Hopkins researchers found the babies born to
women who got prenatal supplements with iron,
folic acid, and zinc had longer, stronger legs
bones than did babies born to women who got
the same supplement minus the zinc.
After you’re born, calcium continues to build
your bones, but only with the help of vitamin D,
which produces a calcium-binding protein that
enables you to absorb the calcium in the milk
Mummy feeds you. To make sure you get your
D, virtually all milk sold in the United States is
fortified with the vitamin. And because you may
outgrow your taste for milk but never outgrow
your need for calcium, calcium supplements for
adults frequently include vitamin D.
But vitamin D isn’t milk’s only contribution.
Remember the iron in the Peruvian (and
American) prenatal supplements? It isn’t there by
accident. Iron increases the production of colla-
gen, the most important protein in bone. Milk
contains lactoferrin (lacto = milk; ferri = iron), an
iron-binding compound that stimulates the pro-
duction of the cells that promote bone growth.
When researchers at the University of Auckland
in New Zealand added lactoferrin from cow’s milk
to a dish of osteoblasts, the bone cells grew more
quickly. When they injected lactoferrin into the
skulls of five lab mice, the bone at the site of the
injection also grew faster, leading the team to
suggest in the journal Endocrinology that lacto-
ferrin may play a role in treating osteoporosis.
No surprise to the Department of Nutrition
Sciences at the University of Arizona, where a
study done with scientists from the University of
Arkansas and Columbia University shows that
women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who get about
18 milligrams of iron a day have stronger, denser
bones than women who get less iron. What
makes this intriguing is that 18 milligrams a day
is more than double the current RDA (8 milli-
grams) for older women.
But the iron/calcium dance is a balancing act.
In your body, iron and calcium appear to com-
pete to see which one gets absorbed. So the
extra iron works only for women who get about
800 to 1,200 milligrams calcium a day — women
who get less and women who get more don’t
seem to benefit from extra iron.
Finally, please note that the word bones begins
with b — as in vitamin B12. The female sex hor-
mone estrogen preserves bone; the male sex
hormone testosterone builds new bone. As
people age and their supply of sex hormones
diminishes, they lose bone faster than they can

Phosphorus
Like calcium, phosphorus is essential for strong bones and teeth. For 
tiptop performance, you need about half as much phosphorus as calcium.
Phosphorus also enables a cell to transmit the genetic code (genes and 
chromosomes that carry information about your special characteristics) 
to the new cells created when a cell divides and reproduces. In addition,
phosphorus
 Helps maintain the pH balance of blood (that is, keeps it from being too
acidic or too alkaline)
 Is vital for metabolizing carbohydrates, synthesizing proteins, and ferry-
ing fats and fatty acids among tissues and organs
 Is part of myelin, the fatty sheath that surrounds and protects each
nerve cell
Phosphorus is in almost everything you eat, but the best sources are high-
protein foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and milk. These foods provide
more than half the phosphorus in a nonvegetarian diet; grains, nuts, seeds,
and dry beans also provide respectable amounts.
Magnesium
Your body uses magnesium to make body tissues, especially bone. The adult
human body has about an ounce of magnesium, and three-quarters of it is in
the bones. Magnesium also is part of more than 300 different enzymes that
trigger chemical reactions throughout your body. You use magnesium to
 Move nutrients in and out of cells
 Send messages between cells
 Transmit the genetic code (genes and chromosomes) when cells divide
and reproduce
153
Chapter 11: Mighty Minerals
replace it. One complicating factor may be low
levels of vitamin B12. A report in the Journal of
Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism says that
researchers at the University of California, San
Francisco, found that women with lower levels
of this vitamin also have less dense hip bones.
So to protect your bones, you need calcium, zinc,
iron, and vitamins D and B12, all found most
abundantly in milk, cheese, eggs, and red meat.
Which sounds like a cardiologist’s nutritional
high-fat, high-cholesterol nightmare — unless
you edit the menu to read: skim milk, low-fat
cheese, egg whites, and lean beef. Way to go.

An adequate supply of magnesium also is heart-healthy because it enables
you to convert food to energy using less oxygen.
Bananas are a good source of magnesium and so are many other plant foods,
including dark green fruits and vegetables (magnesium is part of chlorophyll,
the green pigment in plants), whole seeds, nuts, beans, and grains.
Introducing the trace elements
Trace elements also are minerals, but they’re present in much, much smaller
amounts. That’s why they are called trace minerals. You need just a trace. Get
it? Good! Trace elements include:
 Iron
 Zinc
 Iodine
 Selenium
 Copper
 Manganese
 Fluoride
 Chromium
 Molybdenum
Step up to meet and greet the trace elements.
Iron
Iron is an essential constituent of hemoglobin and myoglobin, two proteins
that store and transport oxygen. You find hemoglobin in red blood cells (it’s
what makes them red). Myoglobin (myo = muscle) is in muscle tissue. Iron
also is part of various enzymes.
Your best food sources of iron are organ meats (liver, heart, kidneys), red
meat, egg yolks, wheat germ, and oysters. These foods contain heme (heme =
blood) iron, a form of iron that your body can easily absorb.
Whole grains, wheat germ, raisins, nuts, seed, prunes and prune juice, and
potato skins contain nonheme iron. Because plants contain substances called
phytates, which bind this iron into compounds, your body has a hard time
getting at the iron. Eating plant foods with meat or with foods that are rich in
vitamin C (like tomatoes) increases your ability to split away the phytates
and get iron out of plant foods.
154
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Zinc
Zinc protects nerve and brain tissue, bolsters the immune system, and is
essential for healthy growth. Zinc is part of the enzymes (and hormones such
as insulin) that metabolize food, and you can fairly call it the macho male
mineral.
The largest quantities of zinc in the male human body are in the testes, where
it’s used in making a continuous supply of testosterone, the hormone a man
needs to produce plentiful amounts of healthy, viable sperm. Without enough
zinc, male fertility falters. So, yes, the old wives’ tale is true: Oysters — a rich
source of zinc — are useful for men. By the way, women also need zinc . . .
just not as much as men do. How much is that? Aha! Check Table 11-1 or leaf
back to Chapter 4.
Other good sources of zinc are meat, liver, and eggs. Plenty of zinc is in nuts,
beans, miso, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, whole-grain products, and wheat
germ. But the zinc in plants, like the iron in plants, occurs in compounds that
your body absorbs less efficiently than the zinc in foods from animals.
Iodine
Iodine is a component of the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyro-
nine, which help regulate cell activities. These hormones are also essential
for protein synthesis, tissue growth (including the formation of healthy
nerves and bones), and reproduction.
The best natural sources of iodine are seafood and plants grown near the
ocean, but modern Americans are most likely to get the iodine they need
from iodized salt (plain table salt with iodine added). And here’s an odd 
nutritional note: You may get substantial amounts of iodine from milk. Are
the cows consuming iodized salt? No. The milk is processed and stored in
machines and vessels kept clean and sanitary with iodates and iodophors,
iodine-based disinfectants. Tiny trace amounts get into the products sent to
the stores. Iodates are also used as dough conditioners (additives that make
dough more pliable), so you’re also likely to find some iodine in most bread
sold in supermarkets.
Selenium
Selenium was identified as an essential human nutrient in 1979 when Chinese
nutrition researchers discovered that people with low body stores of sele-
nium were at increased risk of Keshan disease, a disorder of the heart muscle
with symptoms that include rapid heartbeat, enlarged heart, and (in severe
cases) heart failure, a consequence most common among young children and
women of childbearing age.
155
Chapter 11: Mighty Minerals

How does selenium protect your heart? One possibility is that it works as an
antioxidant in tandem with vitamin E. A second possibility, raised by U.S.
Department of Agriculture studies with laboratory rats, is that it prevents
viruses from attacking heart muscle.
Here’s some exciting news: The results of a four-year study involving 1,312
patients previously treated for skin cancer strongly suggests that daily doses
of selenium in amounts 3.8 times the current recommended daily allowance
(RDA) (55 micrograms) may reduce the incidence of cancers of the lung,
prostate, colon, and rectum. The University of Arizona study was designed 
to see whether taking selenium lowered the risk of skin cancer. It didn’t. But
among the patients who got selenium rather than a placebo, 45 percent fewer
lung cancers, 58 percent fewer colon and rectal cancers, 63 percent fewer
prostate cancers, and a 50 percent lower death rate from cancer overall were
recorded. Now a follow-up study will determine whether these results hold up.
Although fruits and vegetables grown in selenium-rich soils are themselves
rich in this mineral, the best sources of selenium are seafood, meat and organ
meats (liver, kidney), eggs, and dairy products.
Copper
Copper is an antioxidant found in enzymes that deactivate free radicals
(pieces of molecules that can link up to form compounds that damage body
tissues) and make it possible for your body to use iron. Copper also may play
a role in slowing the aging process by decreasing the incidence of protein gly-
cation, a reaction in which sugar molecules (gly = sugar) hook up with protein
molecules in your bloodstream, twist the protein molecules out of shape, and
make them unusable. Protein glycation may result in bone loss, high choles-
terol, cardiac abnormalities, and a slew of other unpleasantries. In people
with diabetes, excess protein glycation may also be one factor involved in
complications such as loss of vision.
In addition, copper
 Promotes the growth of strong bones
 Protects the health of nerve tissue
 Prevents your hair from turning gray prematurely
But, no no, a thousand times, no: Large amounts of copper absolutely,
and I repeat, absolutely will not turn gray hair back to its original color.
Besides, megadoses of copper are potentially toxic.
You can get the copper you need from organ meats (such as liver and heart),
seafood, nuts, and dried beans, including cacao beans (the beans used to
make chocolate).
156
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Manganese
Most of the manganese in your body is in glands (pituitary, mammary, pan-
creas), organs (liver, kidneys, intestines), and bones. Manganese is an essen-
tial constituent of the enzymes that metabolize carbohydrates and synthesize
fats (including cholesterol). Manganese is important for a healthy reproduc-
tive system. During pregnancy, manganese speeds the proper growth of fetal
tissue, particularly bones and cartilage.
You get manganese from whole grains, cereal products, fruits, and vegetables.
Tea is also a good source of manganese.
Fluoride
Fluoride is the form of fluorine (an element) in drinking water. Your body
stores fluoride in bones and teeth. Although researchers still have some
questions about whether fluoride is an essential nutrient, it’s clear that it
hardens dental enamel, reducing your risk of getting cavities. In addition,
some nutrition researchers suspect (but cannot prove) that some forms of
fluoride strengthen bones.
Small amounts of fluoride are in all soil, water, plants, and animal tissues. 
You also get a steady supply of fluoride from fluoridated drinking water.
Chromium
Very small amounts of trivalent chromium, a digestible form of the very same
metallic element that decorates your car and household appliances, are
essential for several enzymes that you need to metabolize fat.
Chromium is also a necessary partner for glucose tolerance factor (GTF), a
group of chemicals that enables insulin (an enzyme from the pancreas) to reg-
ulate your use of glucose, the end product of metabolism and the basic fuel
for every body cell (see Chapter 8). In a recent joint study by USDA and the
Beijing Medical University, adults with noninsulin-dependent diabetes who
took chromium supplements had lower blood levels of sugar, protein, and
cholesterol, which are all good signs for people with diabetes. In a related
study, chromium reduced blood pressure in laboratory rats bred to develop
hypertension (high blood pressure), a common complication in diabetes.
Right now, little information exists about the precise amounts of chromium in
specific foods. Nonetheless, yeast, calves’ liver, American cheese, wheat
germ, and broccoli are regarded as valuable sources of this trace element.
Molybdenum
Molybdenum (pronounced mo-lib-de-num) is part of several enzymes that
metabolize proteins. You get molybdenum from beans and grains. Cows eat
grains, so milk and cheese have some molybdenum. Molybdenum also leeches
into drinking water from surrounding soil. The molybdenum content of plants
and drinking water depends entirely on how much molybdenum is in the soil.

Did you notice something missing from this list? Right you are. There are no
entries for the essential trace elements chromium, fluoride, iodine, molybde-
num, and selenium, because a healthful, varied diet provides sufficient quan-
tities of these nutrients. Iodized salt and fluoridated water are extra
insurance.
Overdoses and Underdoses: 
Too Much and Too Little
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs)
for minerals and trace elements are generous allowances, large enough to
prevent deficiency but not so large that they trigger toxic side effects. (Read
more about RDAs and AIs in Chapter 4.)
Avoiding mineral deficiency
What happens if you don’t get enough minerals and trace elements? Some
minerals, such as phosphorus and magnesium, are so widely available in 
food that deficiencies are rare to nonexistent. No nutrition scientist has yet
been able to identify a naturally occurring deficiency of sulfur, manganese,
chromium, or molybdenum in human beings who follow a sensible diet. Most

drinking water contains adequate fluoride, and Americans get so much
copper (can it be from chocolate bars?) that deficiency is practically unheard
of in the United States.
But other minerals are more problematic:
 Calcium: Without enough calcium, a child’s bones and teeth don’t grow
strong and straight, and an adult’s bones lose minerals and weaken.
Calcium is a team player. To protect against deficiency, you also need
adequate amounts of vitamin D, the nutrient that allows you to absorb
the calcium you get from food or supplements. Milk fortified with vita-
min D has done much to eliminate rickets (see Chapter 10 on vitamins).
 Iron: Iron deficiency anemia is not just an old advertising slogan. Lacking
sufficient iron, your body can’t make the hemoglobin it requires to carry
energy-sustaining oxygen to every tissue. As a result, you’re often tired
and feel weak. Mild iron deficiency may also inhibit intellectual perfor-
mance. In one Johns Hopkins study, high school girls scored higher
verbal, memory, and learning test scores when they took supplements
providing Recommended Dietary Amounts of iron.
Check with your doctor before downing iron supplements or cereals for-
tified with 100 percent of your daily iron requirement, the Environmental
Nutrition newsletter warns. Hemochromatosis, a common but often-undi-
agnosed genetic defect affecting one in every 250 Americans, can lead to
iron overload, an increased absorption of the mineral linked to arthritis,
heart disease, and diabetes, as well as an increased risk of infectious dis-
eases and cancer (viruses and cancer cells thrive in iron-rich blood).
 Zinc: An adequate supply of zinc is vital for making testosterone and
healthy sperm. Men who don’t get enough zinc may be temporarily infer-
tile. Zinc deprivation can make you lose your appetite and your ability to
taste food. It may also weaken your immune system, increasing your risk
of infections. Wounds heal more slowly when you don’t get enough zinc.
That includes the tissue damage caused by working out. In plain lan-
guage: If you don’t get the zinc you need, your charley horse may linger
longer. And, yes, zinc may fight the symptoms of the common cold. To
date, several studies have confirmed that sucking on lozenges contain-
ing one form of zinc (zinc gluconate) shortens a cold — by a day or two.
Others show no differences. Your choice.
These results are for adults, not children, and the zinc tablets are meant
just for the several days of your cold. To find out more about zinc
excess, see the section “Knowing how much is too much” later in this
chapter.
 Iodine: A moderate iodine deficiency leads to goiter (a swollen thyroid
gland) and reduced production of thyroid hormones. A more severe defi-
ciency early in life may cause a form of mental and physical retardation
called cretinism.
162
Part II: What You Get from Food 

 Selenium: Not enough selenium in your diet? Watch out for muscle pain
or weakness. To protect against selenium problems, make sure that you
get plenty of vitamin E. Some animal studies show that a selenium defi-
ciency responds to vitamin E supplements. And vice versa.
Knowing how much is too much
Like some vitamins, some minerals are potentially toxic in large doses:
 Calcium: Though clearly beneficial in amounts higher than the current
RDAs, calcium is not problem-free:
• Constipation, bloating, nausea, and intestinal gas are common side
effects among healthy people taking supplements equal to 1,500 to
4,000 milligrams of calcium a day.
• Doses higher than 4,000 milligrams a day may be linked to kidney
damage.
• Megadoses of calcium can bind with iron and zinc, making it
harder for your body to absorb these two essential trace elements.
 Phosphorus: Too much phosphorus can lower your body stores of 
calcium.
 Magnesium: Megadoses of magnesium appear safe for healthy people,
but if you have kidney disease, the magnesium overload can cause weak
muscles, breathing difficulty, irregular heartbeat and/or cardiac arrest
(your heart stops beating).
 Iron: Overdosing on iron supplements can be deadly, especially for
young children. The lethal dose for a young child may be as low as 3
grams (3,000 milligrams) elemental iron at one time. This is the amount
in 60 tablets with 50 milligrams elemental iron each. For adults, the
lethal dose is estimated to be 200 to 250 milligrams elemental iron per
kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. That’s about 13,600 milligrams for
a 150-pound person — the amount you’d get in 292 tablets with 50 milli-
grams elemental iron each. New FDA rules require individual blister
packaging for supplements containing more than 30 milligrams iron to
foil tiny fingers and prevent accidental overdoses.
 Zinc: Moderately high doses of zinc (up to 25 milligrams a day) may
slow your body’s absorption of copper. Doses 27 to 37 times the RDA 
(11 mg/males; 8 mg/females) may interfere with your immune function
and make you more susceptible to infection, the very thing that normal
doses of zinc protect against. Gram doses (2,000 milligrams/2 grams) of
zinc cause symptoms of zinc poisoning: vomiting, gastric upset, and irri-
tation of the stomach lining.
163
Chapter 11: Mighty Minerals

 Iodine: Overdoses of iodine cause exactly the same problems as iodine
deficiency: goiter. How can that be? When you consume very large
amounts of iodine, the mineral stimulates your thyroid gland, which
swells in a furious attempt to step up its production of thyroid hor-
mones. This reaction may occur among people who eat lots of dried 
seaweed for long periods of time.
 Selenium: In China, nutrition researchers have linked doses as high as 5
milligrams of selenium a day (90 times the RDA) to thickened but fragile
nails, hair loss, and perspiration with a garlicky odor. In the United States,
a small group of people who had accidentally gotten a supplement that
mistakenly contained 27.3 milligrams selenium (436 times the RDA) fell
victim to selenium intoxication — fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and
diarrhea, and nerve damage. The longer they used the supplements, the
worse their symptoms were.
 Fluoride: Despite decades of argument, no scientific proof exists that the
fluorides in drinking water increase the risk of cancer in human beings. 
But there’s no question that large doses of fluoride — which you’re unlikely
to consume unless you drink well or groundwater in the western United
States — causes fluorosis (brown patches on your teeth), brittle bones,
fatigue, and muscle weakness. Over long periods of time, high doses of flu-
oride may also cause outcroppings (little bumps) of bone on the spine.
Fluoride levels higher than 6 milligrams a day are considered hazardous.
 Molybdenum: Doses of molybdenum two to seven times the Adequate
Intake (AI) (45 micrograms) may increase the amount of copper you
excrete in urine.
Exceeding the RDAs: People 
who need extra minerals
If your diet provides enough minerals to meet the RDAs, you’re in pretty good
shape most of the time. But a restrictive diet, the circumstances of your
reproductive life, and just plain getting older can increase your need for min-
erals. Here are some scenarios.
You’re a strict vegetarian
Vegetarians who pass up fish, meat, and poultry must get their iron either
from fortified grain products such as breakfast cereals or commercial breads
or naturally from foods such as seeds, nuts, blackstrap molasses, raisins,
prune juice, potato skins, green leafy vegetables, tofu, miso, or brewer’s yeast.
Because iron in plant foods is bound into compounds that are difficult for the
human body to absorb, iron supplements are pretty much standard fare.
164
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Vegans — vegetarians who avoid all foods from animals, including dairy prod-
ucts — have a similar problem getting the calcium they need. Calcium is in
vegetables, but it, like iron, is bound into hard-to-absorb compounds. So
vegans need calcium-rich substitutes. Good food choices are soybean milk
fortified with calcium, orange juice with added calcium, and tofu processed
with calcium sulfate.
You live inland, away from the ocean
Now here’s a story of 20th century nutritional success. Seafood and plants
grown near the ocean are exposed to iodine-rich seawater. Freshwater fish,
plants grown far from the sea, and the animals that feed on these fish and
plants are not exposed to iodine. So people who live inland and get all their
food from local gardens and farms cannot get the iodine they need from food.
American savvy and technology rode to the rescue in 1924 with the introduc-
tion of iodized salt. Then came refrigerated railroad cars and trucks to carry
165
Chapter 11: Mighty Minerals
I’m looking for an iron supplement. 
What’s this “ferrous” stuff?
The iron in iron supplements comes in several
different forms, each one composed of elemen-
tal iron (the kind of iron your body actually uses)
coupled with an organic acid that makes the
iron easy to absorb.
The iron compounds commonly found in iron
supplements are:
 Ferrous citrate (iron plus citric acid)
 Ferrous fumarate (iron plus fumaric acid)
 Ferrous gluconate (iron plus a sugar derivative)
 Ferrous lactate (iron plus lactic acid, an
acid formed in the fermentation of milk)
 Ferrous succinate (iron plus succinic acid)
 Ferrous sulfate (iron plus a sulfuric acid
derivative)
In your stomach, these compounds dissolve at
different rates, yielding different amounts of ele-
mental iron. So supplement labels list the com-
pound and the amount of elemental iron it
provides, like this:
Ferrous gluconate 300 milligrams
Elemental iron 34 milligrams
This tells you that the supplement has 300 mil-
ligrams of the iron compound ferrous gluconate,
which gives you 34 milligrams of usable ele-
mental iron. If the label just says “iron,” that’s
shorthand for elemental iron. The elemental iron
number is what you look for in judging the iron
content of a vitamin/mineral supplement.

food from both coasts to every inland city and state. Together, modern salt
and efficient shipment virtually eliminated goiter, the iodine deficiency dis-
ease, in this country. Nonetheless, millions of people worldwide still suffer
from chronic iodine deficiency.
You’re a man
Just as women lose iron during menstrual bleeding, men lose zinc at ejacula-
tion. Men who are extremely active sexually may need extra zinc. The trouble
is, no one has ever written down standards for what constitutes “extremely
active.” Check this one out with your doctor.
Men who take a daily supplement of 200 micrograms selenium seem to cut
their risk of prostate cancer by two-thirds. The selenium supplement also
produces an overall drop in cancer mortality, plus a significantly lower risk of
prostate cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer in both men and women.
You’re a woman
The average woman loses about 2 to 3 teaspoons of blood during each men-
strual period, a loss of 1.4 milligrams of iron. Women whose periods are very
heavy lose more blood and more iron. Because getting the iron you need
from a diet providing fewer than 2,000 calories a day may be virtually impos-
sible, you may develop a mild iron deficiency. To remedy this, some doctors
prescribe a daily iron supplement.
Women who use an intrauterine device (IUD) may also be given a prescrip-
tion for iron supplements because IUDs irritate the lining of the uterus and
cause a small but significant loss of blood and iron.
You’re pregnant
The news about pregnancy is that women may not need extra calcium. This
finding, released late in 1998, is so surprising that it probably pays to stay
tuned for more — and definitely check with your own doctor. Meanwhile,
pregnant women still need supplements to build not only fetal tissues but
also new tissues and blood vessels in their own bodies. Animal studies sug-
gest (but don’t prove) that you may also need extra copper to protect nerve
cells in the fetal brain. Nutritional supplements for pregnant women are
specifically formulated to provide the extra nutrients they need.

You’re breast-feeding
Nursing mothers need extra calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, and
selenium to protect their own bodies while producing nutritious breast milk.
The same supplements that provide extra nutrients for pregnant women will
meet a nursing mother’s needs.

Chapter 11: Mighty Minerals
Calcium supplements: What kind 
of calcium is in that pill?
Calcium-rich foods give you calcium paired with
natural organic acids, a combination that your
body easily digests and absorbs.
The form of calcium most commonly found in
supplements, however, is calcium carbonate,
the kind of calcium that occurs naturally in lime-
stone and oyster shells.
Calcium carbonate is a versatile compound. Not
only does it build strong bones and teeth, but it
also neutralizes stomach acid and relieves heart-
burn. Calcium carbonate antacids can be used
as calcium supplements. They’re nutritionally
sound and generally cost less than products
designed solely as nutritional supplements.
Some calcium supplements contain compounds
that mix calcium with an organic acid. Calcium
lactate is calcium plus lactic acid, the combina-
tion that occurs naturally in milk. Calcium citrate
is calcium plus citric acid, an acid found in fruits.
These compounds are easier to digest, but
they’re sometimes more expensive than calcium
carbonate products. Calcium carbonate is nearly
half calcium, a very high percentage. But unless
your stomach is very acidic, it’s hard for your
digestive system to break the compound open
and get at the elemental calcium (the kind of cal-
cium your body can use). You can increase your
absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate by
taking the tablets with meals.
Because different calcium compounds yield dif-
ferent amounts of elemental calcium, the label
lists both the calcium compound and the amount
of elemental calcium provided, like this:
Calcium carbonate, 500 milligrams, provid-
ing 200 milligrams elemental calcium.
Whenever you see the word calcium alone, it
stands for elemental calcium.
The human body absorbs calcium most effi-
ciently in amounts of 500 milligrams or less. You
get more calcium from one 500-milligram cal-
cium tablet twice a day than one 1,000-milligram
tablet. If the 1,000-milligram tablets are a better
buy, break them in half.
Warning: Not all antacids double as dietary sup-
plements. Antacids containing magnesium or
aluminum compounds are safe for neutralizing
stomach acid, but they won’t work as supple-
ments. In fact, just the opposite is true. Taking
magnesium antacids reduces your absorption of
calcium, and taking aluminum antacids reduces
your absorption of phosphorus. Because manu-
facturers sometimes change the ingredients in
their products without notice, you always need
to read the product label before assuming that
an antacid can double as a calcium supplement.

Wow — You think that was a hot flash?
Then you need extra calcium. Both men and women produce the sex hor-
mones testosterone and estrogen, although men make proportionately more
testosterone and women, more estrogen. Testosterone builds bone; estrogen
preserves it.
At menopause, a woman’s production of estrogen drops precipitously, and
her bones rapidly become less dense. As men age and their testosterone
levels drop, they’re also at risk of losing bone tissue, but the loss is less rapid
and dramatic than a woman’s.
For both men and woman, severe loss of bone density can lead to osteoporo-
sis and an increased risk of bone fractures, a condition more common among
women of Caucasian and Asian ancestry. Estrogen supplements can help a
woman maintain bone tissue, but taking the hormone may have serious side
effects, including an increased risk of breast cancer.
Twenty years ago, nutritionists thought it impossible to stop age-related 
loss of bone density — that your body ceased to absorb calcium when you
passed your mid-20s. Today, medications such as alendronate (Fosamax) pro-
tect an aging woman’s bones without estrogen’s potentially harmful effects.
Increasing your consumption of calcium plus vitamin D may also be helpful,
regardless of your gender. But the most recent studies — by which I mean the
study released in February 2006 as I am typing these words — says the value
of extra calcium may not be as high as once believed. What can I say? Stay
tuned for more on this one.

Phabulous Phytochemicals
In This Chapter
 Explaining what phytochemicals are and why they’re important
 Eying accelerating research on phytochemicals
 Using phytochemicals every day
Just when you think you have a handle on a big issue like nutrition, the
Folks in Charge of Everything toss something new on the table.
I thought I included something about every aspect of food and health in the
first edition of Nutrition For Dummies. Then a new word started showing up 
in nutrition articles and reports. The word is phytochemicals, a five-syllable
mouthful meaning chemicals from plants. In addition, I thought it was so inter-
esting that I wrote an entirely new chapter on the subject for NFD/2E (which is
what my editor calls the second edition) and NFD/3E. Now here we are in NFD/
4E, and by golly, finding a nutrition junkie who hasn’t heard of phytochemicals
is difficult. But what people are hearing has turned around a bit.
Phytochemicals (chemicals manufactured only in plants) are the substances
that produce many of the beneficial effects associated with a diet that includes
lots of fruits, vegetables, beans, and grains. This chapter gives you a brief sum-
mary of the nature of phytochemicals, tells where to find them, and explains
how they work.
Phytochemicals Are Everywhere
Did you take French literature in high school or college? If your answer is 
no, you may as well skip to the third sentence in the paragraph that follows.
But if your answer’s yes, then you’re probably familiar with Molière’s The
Bourgeois Gentleman. The bourgeois gentleman is a lovable but pompous
character who’s surprised to discover he’s been speaking prose all his life
without knowing it.

Your relationship with phytochemicals is probably something like that.
You’ve been eating them all your life without knowing it. The following are all
phytochemicals:
 Carotenoids, the pigments that make fruits and vegetables orange, red,
and yellow (dark green vegetables and fruits like kiwi contain these pig-
ments, too, but green chlorophyll masks the carotenoids’ colors)
 Thiocyanates, the smelly sulfur compounds that make you turn up your
nose at the aroma of boiling cabbage
 Daidzein and genistein, hormonelike compounds in many fruits and 
vegetables
 Dietary fiber
These and other phytochemicals, such as vitamins (yes, vitamins), perform
beneficial housekeeping chores in your body. They
 Keep your cells healthy
 Help prevent the formation of carcinogens (cancer-producing substances)
 Reduce cholesterol levels
 Help move food through your intestinal tract
The undeniable value of phytochemicals is one reason the U.S. Department of
Agriculture/Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines for Americans
urges you to have at least five servings of fruits and vegetables and several
servings of grains every day.
Did you notice that no minerals appear in the list of phytochemicals? The
omission is deliberate. Plants don’t manufacture minerals; they absorb them
from the soil. Therefore, minerals aren’t phytochemicals.
Perusing the Different Kinds 
of Phytochemicals
The most interesting phytochemicals in plant foods appear to be antioxi-
dants, hormonelike compounds, and enzyme-activating sulfur compounds.
Each group plays a specific role in maintaining health and reducing your risk
of certain illnesses.
170
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Antioxidants
Antioxidants are named for their ability to prevent a chemical reaction called
oxidation, which enables molecular fragments called free radicals to join
together, forming potentially carcinogenic (cancer-causing) compounds in
your body.
Antioxidants also slow the normal wear-and-tear on body cells, so some
researchers noted that a diet rich in plant foods (fruits, vegetables, grains,
and beans) seems likely to reduce the risk of heart disease and maybe reduce
the risk of some kinds of cancer. For example, consuming lots of lycopene
(the red carotenoid in tomatoes) has been linked to a lower risk of prostate
cancer — as long as the tomatoes are mixed with a dab of oil, which makes
the lycopene easy to absorb.
However (you knew this was coming, right?), recent studies show that
although a diet rich in fruits and veggies is healthful as all get-out, stuffing
yourself with the antioxidant vitamins A and C has ab-so-lute-ly no effect on
the risk of heart disease.
Hormonelike compounds
Many plants contain compounds that behave like estrogens, the female sex
hormones. Because only animal bodies can produce true hormones, these
plant chemicals are called hormonelike compounds or phytoestrogens (plant
estrogen). Seems fair.
The three kinds of phytoestrogens are
 Isoflavones, in fruits, vegetables, and beans
 Lignans, in grains
 Coumestans, in sprouts and alfalfa
The most-studied phytoestrogens are the isoflavones known as daidzein and
genistein (found in soy), two compounds with a chemical structure similar to
estradiol, which is the estrogen produced by mammalian ovaries.
Like natural or synthetic estrogens, daidzein and genistein hook onto sensitive
spots in reproductive tissue (breast, ovary, uterus, prostate) called estrogen
receptors. But phytoestrogens have weaker estrogenic effects than natural or
synthetic estrogens. It takes about 100,000 molecules of daidzein or genistein
171
Chapter 12: Phabulous Phytochemicals

to produce the same estrogenic effect as one molecule of estradiol. Every
phytoestrogen molecule that hooks onto an estrogen receptor displaces a
stronger estrogen molecule. As a result, researchers suggested that consum-
ing isoflavone-rich foods such as soy products may provide post-menopausal
women with the benefits of estrogen (stronger bones and relief from hot
flashes) without the higher risk of reproductive cancers (of the breast, ovary,
or uterus) associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The theory
was supported by the fact that the incidence of breast and uterine cancer,
heart disease, osteoporosis, and menopausal discomfort is lower in countries
where soy — a primary source of phytoestrogens — is a significant part of
the diet.
However, recent animal and human studies offer conflicting evidence. On the
one hand, these studies
 Raise questions about the safety of phytoestrogen-rich foods for women
with hormone-sensitive tumors
 Show that phytoestrogen may stimulate tumor growth in animals whose
ovaries have been removed
 Demonstrate that isoflavone-rich foods have only modest effects on pre-
serving bone and relieving “hot flashes” at menopause
One the other hand, including isoflavone-rich soy foods such as tofu, miso,
tempeh, soy milk, soy flour, and soy protein in a healthful diet
 May reduce total cholesterol, lower LDL (“bad cholesterol”), and main-
tain or even increase blood levels of HDL (“good cholesterol”). In 2005,
researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing announced
the results of a 216-woman study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute in which women consuming 20 grams of soy proteins per
day had significant decreases in LDLs, while women who were given the
same amount of milk protein did not.
 Helps people feel full longer so they can stick to a lower-calorie diet for
managing weight loss.
Bottom Line? According to the International Food Information Council,
“Further clinical studies will continue to increase understanding of the role of
soy in maintaining and improving health.” Couldn’t have said it better myself.
Sulfur compounds
Slide an apple pie in the oven, and soon the kitchen fills with a yummy aroma
that makes your mouth water and your digestive juices flow. But boil some
cabbage and — yuck! What is that awful smell? It’s sulfur, the same chemical
that identifies rotten eggs.
172
Part II: What You Get from Food 

Cruciferous vegetables (named for the Latin word for “cross,” in reference to
their x-shaped blossoms) — such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower,
kale, kohlrabi, mustard seed, radishes, rutabaga, turnips, and watercress — all
contain stinky sulfur compounds, such as sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGSD),
glucobrassicin, gluconapin, gluconasturtin, neoglucobrassicin, and sinigrin, that
seem to tell your body to rev up its production of enzymes that inactivate
and help eliminate carcinogens.
These smelly sulfurs may be one reason why people who eat lots of crucifer-
ous veggies generally have a lower risk of cancer. In animal studies at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine, rats given chemicals known to cause
breast tumors were less likely to develop tumors when they were given broc-
coli sprouts, a food that’s unusually high in sulforaphane. In 2005, a human
trial conducted in China by researchers from Johns Hopkins, Qidong Liver
Cancer Institute, Jiao Tong University (Shanghai), and the University of
Minnesota Cancer Center showed that the sulforaphane-rich sprouts appear
to help the body defang aflatoxins produced by molds that grow on grains
such as rice. Aflatoxins, which damage cells and raise the risk of cancer, may
be linked to the high incidence of stomach and liver cancer in China. Further
studies are in the planning phases. (But of course.)
Dietary fiber
Dietary fiber is a special bonus found only in plant foods. You can’t get it
from meat or fish or poultry or eggs or dairy foods.
Soluble dietary fiber, such as the pectins in apples and the gums in beans,
mops up cholesterol and lowers your risk of heart disease. Insoluble dietary
fiber, such as the cellulose in fruit skins, bulks up stool and prevents consti-
pation, moving food more quickly through your gut so there’s less time for
food to create substances thought to trigger the growth of cancerous cells.
(Turn to Chapter 4 to find out how much dietary fiber you need to get each
day and to Chapter 8 to read everything you ever wanted to know about
dietary fiber — maybe even more.)
Phorecasting the Phuture 
of Phytochemicals
Yes, I know that misspelling forecasting as “phorecasting” and future as
“phuture” is gross. Yes, I know I already named this chapter “Phabulous
Phytochemicals” and that should have been enough, but I just couldn’t resist
the tempting play on words.
173
Chapter 12: Phabulous Phytochemicals

Please don’t let my lack of semantic restraint turn you away from the fact
that phytochemical research is serious stuff that eventually should enable
people to identify biochemical reactions that trigger — or prevent — specific
medical conditions.
While you’re waiting for final analyses, the best nutrition advice is to dig into
those veggies, fruits, and grains — and turn to Chapter 13 to find out why you
need to wash them down with plenty of cold, clear water.

Chapter 13
Water Works
In This Chapter
 Understanding why you need water
 Finding out where you get the water you need
 Deciding exactly how much water you need
 Discovering the nature and functions of electrolytes
Your body is mostly (50 to 70 percent) water. Exactly how much water
depends on how old you are and how much muscle and fat you have.
Muscle tissue has more water than fat tissue. Because the average male body
has proportionately more muscle than the average female body, it also has
more water. For the same reason — more muscle — a young body has more
water than an older one.
You definitely won’t enjoy the experience, but if you have to, you can live
without food for weeks at a time, getting subsistence levels of nutrients by
digesting your own muscle and fat. But water’s different. Without it, you’ll die
in a matter of days — more quickly in a place warm enough to make you per-
spire and lose water more quickly.
This chapter clues you in on why water is so important, not to mention how
you can manage to keep your body’s water level, well, level.
Investigating the Many Ways 
Your Body Uses Water
Water is a solvent. It dissolves other substances and carries nutrients and
other material (such as blood cells) around the body, making it possible for
every organ to do its job. You need water to
 Digest food, dissolving nutrients so that they can pass through the
intestinal cell walls into your bloodstream, and move food along through
your intestinal tract

 Carry waste products out of your body
 Provide a medium in which biochemical reactions such as metabolism
(digesting food, producing energy, and building tissue) occur
 Send electrical messages between cells so that your muscles can move,
your eyes can see, your brain can think, and so on
 Regulate body temperature — cooling your body with moisture (perspi-
ration) that evaporates on your skin
 Lubricate your moving parts
Maintaining the Right Amount 
of Water in Your Body
As much as three-quarters of the water in your body is in intracellular fluid,
the liquid inside body cells. The rest is in extracellular fluid, which is all the
other body liquids, such as
 Interstitial fluid (the fluid between cells)
 Blood plasma (the clear liquid in blood)
 Lymph (a clear, slightly yellow fluid collected from body tissues that
flows through your lymph nodes and eventually into your blood vessels)
 Bodily secretions such as sweat, seminal fluid, and vaginal fluids
 Urine
A healthy body has just the right amount of fluid inside and outside each cell,
a situation medical folk call fluid balance. Maintaining your fluid balance is
essential to life. If too little water is inside a cell, it shrivels and dies. If there’s
too much water, the cell bursts.
A balancing act: The role of electrolytes
Your body maintains its fluid balance through the action of substances called
electrolytes, which are mineral compounds that, when dissolved in water,
become electrically charged particles called ions.
Many minerals, including calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, form com-
pounds that dissolve into charged particles. But nutritionists generally use the
term electrolyte to describe sodium, potassium, and chlorine. The most famil-
iar electrolyte is the one found on every dinner table: sodium chloride — plain
old table salt. (In water, its molecules dissolve into two ions: one sodium ion
and one chloride ion.)

Fluoridated water: The real Tooth Fairy
Except for the common cold, dental cavities are
the most common human medical problem.
You get cavities from mutans streptococci, bac-
teria that live in dental plaque. The bacteria
digest and ferment carbohydrate residue on
your teeth (plain table sugar is the worst
offender) leaving acid that eats away at the min-
eral surface of the tooth. This eating away is
called decay. When the decay gets past the
enamel to the softer pulp inside of the tooth,
your tooth hurts. And you head for the dentist
even though you hate it so much you’d almost
rather put up with the pain. But almost doesn’t
count, so off you go.
Brushing and flossing help prevent cavities by
cleaning your teeth so that bacteria have less
to feast on. Another way to reduce your sus-
ceptibility to cavities is to drink fluoridated
water — water containing the mineral fluorine.
Fluoride — the form of fluorine found in food
and water — combines with other minerals in
teeth and makes the minerals less soluble
(harder to dissolve). You get the most benefit by
drinking water containing 1 part fluoride to
every 1 million parts water (1 ppm) from the day
you’re born until the day you get your last per-
manent tooth, usually around age 11 to 13.
Some drinking water, notably in the American
Southwest, is fluoridated naturally when it flows
through rocks containing fluorine. Sometimes
so much fluoride is in this water that it causes a
brownish spotting (or mottling) that occurs
while teeth are developing and accumulating
minerals. This effect doesn’t occur with drink-
ing water artificially supplemented with fluoride
at the approved standard of one part fluoride to
every million parts of water.
Because fluorides concentrate in bones, some
people believe that drinking fluoridated water
raises the risk of bone cancers, but no evidence
to support this claim has ever been found in
human beings. However, in 1990, a U.S. Public
Health Service’s National Toxicology Program
(NTP) study of the long-term effects of high 
fluoride consumption on laboratory rats and
mice added fuel to the fire: Four of the 1,044 lab-
oratory rats and mice fed high doses of fluoride
for two years developed osteosarcoma, a form
of bone cancer.
The study sent an immediate frisson (shiver of
fear) through the health community, but within
a year, federal officials reviewing the study
issued an opinion endorsing the safety and
effectiveness of fluoridated water.
Here’s why: First, the number of cancers among
the laboratory animals was low enough to have
occurred simply by chance. Second, the can-
cers occurred only in male rats; no cases were
reported in female rats or mice of either sex.
Finally, the amount of fluorides the animals
ingested was 50 to 100 times higher than what
you get in drinking water. To get as much fluo-
ride as those rats did, human beings would have
to drink more than 380 8-ounce glasses of fluo-
ridated water a day.
Today, more than half the people living in 
the United States have access to adequately
fluoridated public water supplies. The result 
is a lifelong 50 percent to 70 percent reduc-
tion in cavities among the residents of these
communities.

Under normal circumstances, the fluid inside your cells has more potassium
than sodium and chloride. The fluid outside is just the opposite: more sodium
and chloride than potassium. The cell wall is a semipermeable membrane;
some things pass through, but others don’t. Water molecules and small min-
eral molecules flow through freely, unlike larger molecules such as proteins.
The process by which sodium flows out and potassium flows in to keep
things on an even keel is called the sodium pump. If this process were to
cease, sodium ions would build up inside your cells. Sodium attracts water;
the more sodium there is inside the cell, the more water flows in. Eventually,
the cell would burst and die. The sodium pump, regular as a clock, prevents
this imbalance from happening so you can move along, blissfully unaware of
those efficient, electric ions.
Dehydrating without enough 
water and electrolytes
Drink more water than you need, and your healthy body simply shrugs its
shoulders, so to speak, urinates more copiously, and readjusts the water
level. It’s hard for a healthy person on a normal diet to drink himself or her-
self to death on water.
But if you don’t get enough water, your body lets you know pretty quickly.
The first sign is thirst, that unpleasant dryness in your mouth caused by the
loss of water from cells in your gums, tongue, and cheeks. The second sign is
reduced urination.
178
Part II: What You Get from Food 
What else do those electrolytes do?
In addition to keeping fluid levels balanced,
sodium, potassium, and chloride (the form of
chlorine found in food) ions create electrical
impulses that enable cells to send messages
back and forth between themselves so you can
think, see, move, and perform all the bioelectri-
cal functions that you take for granted.
Sodium, potassium, and chloride are also major
minerals (see Chapter 11) and essential nutri-
ents. Like other nutrients, they’re useful in these
bodily processes:
 Sodium helps digest proteins and carbohy-
drates and keeps your blood from becom-
ing too acidic or too alkaline.
 Potassium is used in digestion to synthesize
proteins and starch and is a major con-
stituent of muscle tissue.
 Chloride is a constituent of hydrochloric
acid, which breaks down food in your stom-
ach. It’s also used by white blood cells to
make hypochlorite, a natural antiseptic.

Reduced urination is a protective mechanism triggered by ADH, a hormone
secreted by the hypothalamus, a gland at the base of your brain. The initials
are short for antidiuretic hormone. Remember, a diuretic is a substance, such
as caffeine, that increases urine production. ADH does just the opposite,
helping your body conserve water rather than eliminate it.
If you don’t heed these signals, your tissues will begin to dry out. In other words,
you’re dehydrating, and if you don’t — or can’t — get water, you won’t survive.
Getting the Water You Need
Because you don’t store water, you need to take in a new supply every day,
enough to replace what you lose when you breathe, perspire, urinate, and
defecate. On average, this needed amount adds up to 1,500 to 3,000 milliliters
(50 to 100 ounces; 6 to 12.5 cups) a day. Here’s where the water goes:
 850 to 1,200 milliliters (28 to 40 ounces) is lost in breath and perspiration.
 600 to 1,600 milliliters (20 to 53 ounces) is lost in urine.
 50 to 200 milliliters (1.6 to 6.6 ounces) is lost in feces.
Toss in some extra ounces for a safe margin, and you get the current recom-
mendations that women age 19 and up consume about 11 cups of water a day
and men age 19 and up, about 15. But not all that water must come in a cup
from the tap. About 15 percent of the water that you need is created when you
digest and metabolize food. The end products of digestion and metabolism are
carbon dioxide (a waste product that you breathe out of your body) and water
composed of hydrogen from food and oxygen from the air that you breathe.
The rest of your daily water comes directly from what you eat and drink. You
can get water from, well, plain water. Eight 10-ounce glasses give you 2,400 mil-
liliters, approximately enough to replace what your body loses every day, so
everyone from athletes to couch potatoes knows that a healthy body needs
eight full glasses of water a day. Or at least they thought they knew, but then
Dartmouth Medical School kidney specialist Heinz Valtin turned off the tap.
Yes, the National Research Council’s Food and Nutrition Board says each of us
needs about 1 milliliter (ml) of water for each calorie of food we consume. On
a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, that’s about 74 fluid ounces, or slightly more than
nine 8-ounce glasses a day. Fair enough, Valtin said, but who says that it all
has to come from, well, water? His report in the American Journal of Physiology
(2003) points out that some of the water you require is right there in your food.
Fruits and vegetables are full of water. Lettuce, for example, is 90 percent
water. Furthermore, you get water from foods that you’d never think of as
water sources: hamburger (more than 50 percent), cheese (the softer the
cheese, the higher the water content — Swiss cheese is 38 percent water; skim
milk ricotta, 74 percent), a plain, hard bagel (29 percent water), milk powder (2
percent), and even butter and margarine (10 percent). Only oils have no water.
179
Chapter 13: Water Works

In other words (actually in Valtin’s words), a healthy adult in a temperate cli-
mate who isn’t perspiring heavily can get enough water simply by drinking
only when he or she is thirsty. Gulp. Or by drinking water when he or she is
also drinking lots of coffee, tea, soft drinks, or alcohol.
Not all liquids are equally liquefying. The caffeine in coffee and tea and the
alcohol in beer, wine, and spirits are diuretics, chemicals that make you uri-
nate more copiously. Although caffeinated and alcohol beverages provide
water, they also increase its elimination from your body — which is why you
feel thirsty the morning after you’ve had a glass or two of wine. And when
you feel thirsty, what do you do? Drink some water.
Taking in Extra Water and 
Electrolytes As Needed
In the United States, most people regularly consume much more sodium than
they need. In fact, some people who are sodium-sensitive may end up with
high blood pressure that can be lowered if they reduce their sodium intake.
For more about high blood pressure, check out High Blood Pressure For
Dummies (published by Wiley) by Alan L. Rubin, M.D.

Part II: What You Get from Food 
How does water know where to go?
Osmosis is the principle that governs how water
flows through a semipermeable membrane (one
that lets only certain substances pass through)
such as the one surrounding a body cell.
Here’s the principle: Water flows through a
semipermeable membrane from the side where
the liquid solution is least dense to the side
where it’s denser. In other words, the water,
acting as if it has a mind of its own, tries to
equalize the densities of the liquids on both
sides of the membrane.
How does the water know which side is more
dense? Now that one’s easy: Wherever the
sodium content is higher. When more sodium is
inside the cell, more water flows in to dilute it.
When more sodium is in the fluid outside the
cell, water flows out of the cell to dilute the
liquid on the outside.
Osmosis explains why drinking seawater doesn’t
hydrate your body. When you drink seawater,
liquid flows out of your cells to dilute the salty
solution in your intestinal tract. The more you
drink, the more water you lose. When you drink
seawater, you’re literally drinking yourself into
dehydration.
Of course, the same thing happens — though
certainly to a lesser degree — when you eat
salted pretzels or nuts. The salt in your mouth
makes your saliva saltier. This draws liquid out
of the cells in your cheeks and tongue, which
feel uncomfortably dry. You need . . . a drink of
water!

Potassium and chloride are found in so many foods that here, too, a dietary
deficiency is a rarity. In fact, the only recorded case of chloride deficiency
was among infants given a formula liquid from which the chloride was inad-
vertently omitted.
In 2004, the Adequate Intake (AI) for sodium, potassium, and chloride were
set at one-size-fits-all averages for a healthy adult age 19–50 weighing 70 kilo-
grams (154 pounds; see Chapter 4 for more on AI):
 Sodium: 1,500 milligrams
 Potassium: 4,700 milligrams
 Chloride: 2,300 milligrams
Most Americans get much more as a matter of course, and sometimes you
actually need extra water and electrolytes. The next sections tell you when.

Death by dehydration: Not a pretty sight
Every day, you lose an amount of water equal to
about 4 percent of your total weight. If you don’t
take in enough water to replace what you lose
naturally by breathing, perspiring, urinating, and
defecating, warning signals go off loud and
clear.
Early on, when you’ve lost just a little water,
equal to about 1 percent of your body weight,
you feel thirsty. If you ignore thirst, it grows
more intense.
When water loss rises to about 2 percent of
your weight, your appetite fades. Your circula-
tion slows as water seeps out of blood cells and
blood plasma. And you experience a sense of
emotional discomfort, a perception that things
are, well, not right.
By the time your water loss equals 4 percent of
your body weight (5 pounds for a 130-pound
woman; 7 pounds for a 170-pound man), you’re
slightly nauseated, your skin is flushed, and
you’re very, very tired. With less water circulat-
ing through your tissues, your hands and 
feet tingle, your head aches, your temperature
rises, you breathe more quickly, and your pulse
quickens.
After this, things begin spiraling downhill. When
your water loss reaches 10 percent of your body
weight, your tongue swells, your kidneys start
to fail, and you’re so dizzy that you can’t stand
on one foot with your eyes closed. In fact, you
probably can’t even try: Your muscles are in
spasm.
When you lose enough water to equal 15 per-
cent of your body weight, you’re deaf and pretty
much unable to see out of eyes that are sunken
and covered with stiffened lids. Your skin has
shrunk, and your tongue has shriveled.
When you’ve lost water equal to 20 percent of
your body weight, you’ve had it. You’re at the
limit of your endurance. Deprived of life-giving
liquid, your skin cracks, and your organs grind
to a halt. And — sorry about this — so do you.
Ave atque vale, as the Romans say. Or as the
Romans say when in the U.S.A, Canada, Great
Britain, Australia, or any place where English is
the mother tongue: “Hail and Farewell.”

You’re sick to your stomach
Repeated vomiting or diarrhea drains your body of water and electrolytes.
Similarly, you also need extra water to replace the liquid lost in perspiration
when you have a high fever.
When you lose enough water to be dangerously dehydrated, you also lose the
electrolytes you need to maintain fluid balance, regulate body temperature,
and trigger dozens of biochemical reactions. Plain water doesn’t replace those
electrolytes. Check with your doctor for a drink that will hydrate your body
without upsetting your tummy.
You’re exercising or working 
hard in a hot environment
When you’re warm, your body perspires. The moisture evaporates and cools
your skin so that blood circulating up from the center of your body to the
surface is cooled. The cooled blood returns to the center of your body, lower-
ing the temperature (your core temperature) there, too.
If you don’t cool your body down, you continue losing water. If you don’t
replace the lost water, things can get dicey because not only are you losing
water, you’re also losing electrolytes. The most common cause of temporary
sodium, potassium, and chloride depletion is heavy, uncontrolled perspiration.

When ginger ale won’t cut it
Serious dehydration calls for serious medicine,
such as the World Health Organization’s handy-
dandy, two-tumbler electrolyte replacement 
formula.
Wait! Stop! If you’re reading this while lying in
bed exhausted by some variety of turista, the
traveler’s diarrhea acquired from impure drink-
ing water, do not make the formula without
absolutely clean glasses, washed in bottled
water. Better yet, get paper cups.
Now here’s what you need:
Glass No. 1
8 ounces orange juice
A pinch of salt
1⁄2 teaspoon sweetener (honey, corn syrup)
Glass No. 2
8 ounces boiled or bottled or distilled water
1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda
Take a sip from one glass, then the other, and
continue until finished. If diarrhea continues,
contact your doctor.

Deprived of water and electrolytes, your muscles cramp, you’re dizzy and
weak, and perspiration, now uncontrolled, no longer cools you. Your core
body temperature begins rising, and without relief — air conditioning or a
cool shower, plus water, ginger ale, or fruit juice — you may progress from
heat cramps to heat exhaustion to heat stroke. The latter is potentially fatal.
But — and it’s a big one — drinking too much water while exercising can also
be hazardous to your health. Flooding your body with liquid dilutes the sodium
in your bloodstream and may make your brain and other body tissues swell, a
condition known as hyponaturemia or “water intoxication.” The New Rule from
the American College of Sports Medicine is to drink just enough water to main-
tain your body weight while working out. How much is that? Step on a scale
before exercising. Exercise for an hour. Step back on the scale. You need 16
ounces of water to replace every pound lost in your one hour’s exercise. Lose
one pound, drink 16 ounces. Lose 1⁄2 pound, drink 8 ounces. That was easy!
You’re on a high-protein diet
You need extra water to eliminate the nitrogen compounds in protein. This is
true of infants on high-protein formulas and adults on high-protein weight-
reducing diets. See Chapter 6 to find out why too much protein may be so
harmful.
You’re taking certain medications
Because some medications interact with water and electrolytes, always 
ask whether you need extra water and electrolytes whenever your doctor
prescribes
 Diuretics: They increase the loss of sodium, potassium, and chloride.
 Neomycin (an antibiotic): It binds sodium into insoluble compounds,
making it less available to your body.
 Colchicine (an antigout drug): It lowers your absorption of sodium.
You have high blood pressure
In 1997, when researchers at Johns Hopkins analyzed the results of more than
30 studies dealing with high blood pressure, they found that people taking
daily supplements of 2,500 mg (2.5 grams) of potassium were likely to have
blood pressure several points lower than people not taking the supplements.
Ask your doctor about this one, and remember: Food is also a good source of
potassium. One whole banana has up to 470 milligrams of potassium, one cup
of dates — 1,160 milligrams, and one cup of raisins — 1,239 milligrams.

Part II: What You Get from Food 
Water is water. Or is it?
Chemically speaking, water’s an odd duck. It’s
the only substance on Earth than can exist as a
liquid (water) and a solid (ice) — but not a bend-
able plastic. No, snow is not plastic water. It’s a
grouping of solids (ice crystals).
Water may be hard or soft, but these terms have
nothing to do with how the water feels on your
hand. They describe the liquid’s mineral content:
 Hard water has lots of minerals, particularly
calcium and magnesium. This water rises to
the Earth’s surface from underground
springs, usually picking up calcium carbon-
ate as it moves up through the ground.
 Soft water has fewer minerals. In nature,
soft water is surface water, the runoff from
rain-swollen streams or rainwater that falls
directly into reservoirs. “Water softeners”
are products that attract and remove the
minerals in water.
What you get at the supermarket is another
thing altogether:
 Distilled water is tap water that has been
distilled, or boiled until it turns to steam,
which is then collected and condensed
back into a liquid free of impurities, chemi-
cals, and minerals. The name may also 
be used to describe a liquid produced by
ultrafiltration, a process that removes
everything from the water except water
molecules. Distilled water is very important
in chemical and pharmaceutical process-
ing. You’ll appreciate the fact that it doesn’t
clog your iron; makes clean, clear ice
cubes; and serves as a flavor-free mixer or
base for tea and coffee.
 Mineral water is spring water. It’s nat-
urally alkaline, which makes it a natural
antacid and a mild diuretic (a substance
that increases urination). The term spring
water is used to describe water from
springs nearer to the Earth’s surface, so it
has fewer mineral particles and what some
people describe as a “cleaner taste” than
mineral water.
 Still water is spring water that flows up to
the surface on its own. Sparkling water is
pushed to the top by naturally occurring
gases in the underground spring. So, you
ask, what’s the big difference? Sparkling
water has bubbles; still water doesn’t.
 Springlike or spring fresh are terms
designed to make something sound more
highfalutin than it really is. These products
aren’t spring water; they’re probably filtered
tap water.

healthy diet right here. The chapters in this part are
chock-full of guidelines from the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans 2005 and strategies based on MyPyramid, the
Official Word on making selections that enhance your
body while pleasing your palate. And, oh yes, there’s an
explanation of why you get hungry and why you find some
foods more appetizing than others — an important factor
in creating a nutritious diet. (Hey, if it doesn’t taste good,
why would you want to eat it?)

B
ecause you need food to live, your body is no slouch at letting you know
that it’s ready for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe a few snacks in
between. This chapter explains the signals your body uses to get you to the
table, to the drive-through of your favorite restaurant, or to the vending
machine down the hall.
Understanding the Difference between
Hunger and Appetite
People eat for two main reasons. The first reason is hunger; the second is
appetite. Hunger and appetite are not synonyms. In fact, hunger and appetite
are entirely different processes.
Hunger is the need for food. It is
 A physical reaction that includes chemical changes in your body related
to a naturally low level of glucose in your blood several hours after eating
 An instinctive, protective mechanism that makes sure that your body
gets the fuel it requires to function reasonably well
Appetite is the desire for food. It is
 A sensory or psychological reaction (looks good! smells good!) that
stimulates an involuntary physiological response (salivation, stomach
contractions)
 A conditioned response to food (see the sidebar on Pavlov’s dogs)

The practical difference between hunger and appetite is this: When you’re
hungry, you eat one hot dog. After that, your appetite may lead you to eat
two more hot dogs just because they look appealing or taste good.
In other words, appetite is the basis for the familiar saying: “Your eyes are
bigger than your stomach.” Not to mention the well-known advertising slogan:
“Bet you can’t eat just one.” Hey, these guys know their customers.
Refueling: The Cycle of 
Hunger and Satiety
Your body does its best to create cycles of activity that parallel a 24-hour day.
Like sleep, hunger occurs at pretty regular intervals, although your lifestyle
may make it difficult to follow this natural pattern — even when your stom-
ach loudly announces it’s empty!
Recognizing hunger
The clearest signals that your body wants food, right now, are the physical
reactions from your stomach and your blood that let you know it’s definitely
time to put more food in your mouth and — eat!
188
Part III: Healthy Eating 
Pavlov’s performing puppies
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849–1936) was a
Russian physiologist who won the Nobel Prize
in physiology/medicine in 1904 for his research
on the digestive glands. Pavlov’s Big Bang,
though, was his identification of respondent
conditioning — a fancy way of saying that you
can train people to respond physically (or emo-
tionally) to an object or stimulus that simply
reminds them of something that they love or
hate.
Pavlov tested respondent conditioning on dogs.
He began by ringing a bell each time he offered
food to his laboratory dogs so that the dogs
learned to associate the sound of the bell with
the sight and smell of food.
Then he rang the bell without offering the food,
and the dogs responded as though food were
on tap — salivating madly, even though the dish
was empty.
Respondent conditioning applies to many things
other than food. For example, it can make a win-
ning Olympic athlete teary at the sight of the flag
that represents his country. Food companies
are great at using respondent conditioning to
encourage you to buy their products: When you
see a picture of a deep, dark, rich chocolate bar,
doesn’t your mouth start to water, and. . . . Hey,
come back! Where are you going?

Growling and rumbling: Your stomach speaks
An empty belly has no manners. If you do not fill it right away, your stomach
will issue an audible — sometimes embarrassing — call for food. This rum-
bling signal is called a hunger pang.
Hunger pangs actually are plain old muscle contractions. When your stom-
ach’s full, these contractions and their continual waves down the entire
length of the intestine — known as peristalsis — move food through your
digestive tract (see Chapter 2 for more about digestion). When your stom-
ach’s empty, the contractions just squeeze air, and that makes noise.
This phenomenon first was observed in 1912 by an American physiologist
named Walter B. Cannon. (Cannon? Rumble? Could I make this up?) Cannon
convinced a fellow researcher to swallow a small balloon attached to a thin tube
connected to a pressure-sensitive machine. Then Cannon inflated and deflated
the balloon to simulate the sensation of a full or empty stomach. Measuring the
pressure and frequency of his volunteer’s stomach contractions, Cannon dis-
covered that the contractions were strongest and occurred most frequently
when the balloon was deflated and the stomach empty. Cannon drew the obvi-
ous conclusion: When your stomach is empty, you feel hungry.
Getting that empty feeling
Every time you eat, your pancreas secretes insulin, a hormone that enables you
to move blood sugar (glucose) out of the blood and into cells where it’s needed
for various chores. Glucose is the basic fuel your body uses for energy. (See
Chapter 8.) As a result, the level of glucose circulating in your blood rises and
then declines naturally, producing a vague feeling of emptiness, and perhaps
weakness, that prompts you to eat. Most people experience the natural rise
and fall of glucose as a relatively smooth pattern that lasts about four hours.
189
Chapter 14: Why You Eat When You Eat
What meal is this, anyway?
Breakfast and lunch leave no doubt. The first
comes right after you wake up in the morning;
the second, in the middle of the day, sometime
around noon.
But when do you eat dinner? And what about
supper?
According to Webster’s New International Dic-
tionary of the English Language (2nd edition,
1941 — 15 pounds, including the new binding 
I put on when the old one crumbled after I
dropped the darned thing on its spine once too
often), dinner is the main meal of the day, usu-
ally eaten around midday, although (get this)
some people, “especially in cities,” have their
dinner between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. — which prob-
ably makes it their supper, because Webster’s
calls that a meal you eat at the end of the day.
In other words, dinner is lunch except when it’s
supper. Help!

Knowing when you’re full
The satisfying feeling of fullness after eating is called satiety, the signal that
says, okay, hold the hot dogs, I’ve had plenty, and I need to push back from
the table.
As nutrition research and the understanding of brain functions have become
more sophisticated, scientists have discovered that your hypothalamus, a
small gland on top of the brain stem (the part of the brain that connects to
the top of the spinal cord), seems to house your appetite controls in an area
of the brain where hormones and other chemicals that control hunger and
appetite are made (see Figure 14-1). For example, the hypothalamus releases
neuropeptide Y (NPY), a chemical that latches onto brain cells and then send
out a signal: More food!
Other body cells also play a role in making your body say, “I’m full.” In 1995,
researchers at Rockefeller University discovered a gene in fat cells (the body
cells where fat is stored) that directs the production of a hormone called
leptin (from the Greek word for thin). Leptin appears to tell your body how
much fat you have stored, thus regulating your hunger (need for food to

Your

mus is in
charge of
your

190
Part III: Healthy Eating 

provide fuel). Leptin also reduces the hypothalamus’s secretion of NPY, the
hormone that signals hunger. When the Rockefeller folks injected leptin into
specially bred fat mice, the mice ate less, burned food faster, and lost signifi-
cant amounts of weight.
Eventually, researchers hope that this kind of information can lead to the cre-
ation of safe and effective drugs to combat obesity.
Beating the four-hour hungries
Throughout the world, the cycle of hunger (namely, of glucose rising and
falling) prompts a feeding schedule that generally provides four meals during
the day: breakfast, lunch, tea (a mid-afternoon meal), and supper.
In the United States, a three-meal-a-day culture forces people to fight their nat-
ural rhythm by going without food from lunch at noon to supper at 6 p.m. or
later. The unpleasant result is that when glucose levels decline around 4 p.m.,
and people in many countries are enjoying afternoon tea, many Americans get
really testy and try to satisfy their natural hunger by grabbing the nearest
food, usually a high-fat, high-calorie snack.
In 1989, David Jenkins, M.D., Ph.D., and Tom Wolever, M.D., Ph.D., of the
University of Toronto, set up a “nibbling study” designed to test the idea that
if you even out digestion — by eating several small meals rather than three
big ones — you can spread out insulin secretion and keep the amount of glu-
cose in your blood on an even keel all day long.
The theory turned out to be right. People who ate five or six small meals
rather than three big ones felt better and experienced an extra bonus: lower
cholesterol levels. After two weeks of nibbling, the people in the Jenkins-
Wolever study showed a 13.5 percent lower level of low-density lipoproteins
(LDL) than people who ate exactly the same amount of food divided into three
big meals. As a result, many diets designed to help you lose weight or control
your cholesterol (what? you haven’t got a copy of Controlling Cholesterol For
Dummies? Impossible!) now emphasize a daily regimen of several small meals
rather than the basic big three. Smart cookies. Low-fat, low-cholesterol, low-
cal, of course.
Maintaining a healthy appetite
The best way to deal with hunger and appetite is to find out how to recognize
and follow your body’s natural cues.
191
Chapter 14: Why You Eat When You Eat

If you’re hungry, eat — in reasonable amounts that support a realistic weight.
(Confused about how much you should weigh? Check out the weight table in
Chapter 3.) And remember: Nobody’s perfect. Make one day’s indulgence
guilt-free by reducing your calorie intake proportionately over the next few
days. A little give here, a little take there, and you’ll stay on target overall.
Responding to Your Environment 
on a Gut Level
Your physical and psychological environments definitely affect appetite and
hunger, sometimes leading you to eat more than normal, sometimes less.
Baby, it’s cold outside
You’re more likely to feel hungry when you’re in a cool place than you are
when you’re in a warm one. And you’re more likely to want high-calorie dishes
in cold weather than in hot weather. Just think about the foods that tempt you
in winter — stews, roasts, thick soups — versus those you find pleasing on a
simmering summer day — salads, chilled fruit, simple sandwiches.
This difference is no accident. Food gives you calories. Calories keep you
warm. Making sure that you get what you need, your body even processes
food faster when it’s cold out. Your stomach empties more quickly as food
speeds along through the digestive tract, which means those old hunger
pangs show up sooner than expected, which, in turn, means that you eat
more and stay warmer and . . . well, you get the picture.
Exercising more than your mouth
Everybody knows that working out gives you a big appetite, right? Well,
everybody’s wrong (it happens all the time). Yes, people who exercise regu-
larly are likely to have a healthy (read: normal) appetite, but they’re rarely
hungry immediately after exercising because
 Exercise pulls stored energy — glucose and fat — out of body tissues, so
your glucose levels stay steady and you don’t feel hungry.
 Exercise slows the passage of food through the digestive tract. Your
stomach empties more slowly and you feel fuller longer.
192
Part III: Healthy Eating 

Caution: If you eat a heavy meal right before heading for the gym or the
stationary bike in your bedroom, the food sitting in your stomach may
make you feel stuffed. Sometimes, you may develop cramps. Or — as
Heartburn & Reflux For Dummies (Wiley) explains — heartburn. Ouch.
 Exercise (including mental exertion) reduces anxiety. For some people,
that means less desire to reach for a snack.
Nursing your appetite back to health
Severe physical stress or trauma — a broken bone, surgery, a burn, a high
fever — reduces appetite and slows the natural contractions of the intestinal
tract. If you eat at times like this, the food may back up in your gut or even
stretch your bowel enough to tear it. In situations like this, intravenous 
feeding — fluids with nutrients sent through a needle directly into a vein —
give you nutrition without irritation.
Taking medicine, changing your appetite
Taking some medicines may make you more (or less) likely to eat. Some
drugs used to treat common conditions affect your appetite. When you use
these medicines, you may find yourself eating more (or less) than usual. This
side effect is rarely mentioned when doctors hand out prescriptions, perhaps
because it isn’t life-threatening and usually disappears when you stop taking
the drug.
Some examples of appetite uppers are certain antidepressants (mood eleva-
tors), antihistamines (allergy pills), diuretics (drugs that make you urinate
more frequently), steroids (drugs that fight inflammation), and tranquilizers
(calming drugs). Appetite reducers include some antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs,
anti-seizure drugs, blood pressure medications, and cholesterol-lowering
drugs.
Of course, not every drug in a particular class of drugs (that is, antibiotics 
or antidepressants) has the same effect on appetite. For example, the antide-
pressant drug amitriptyline (Elavil) increases your appetite and may cause
weight gain; another antidepressant drug, fluoxetine (Prozac) usually does not.
The fact that a drug affects appetite is almost never a reason to avoid using
it. But knowing that a relationship exists between the drug and your desire
for food can be helpful. Plain common sense dictates that you ask your doctor
about possible drug/appetite interactions whenever a drug is prescribed for
193
Chapter 14: Why You Eat When You Eat

you. If the drug package the pharmacist gives you doesn’t come with an
insert, ask for one. Read the fine print about side effects and other interesting
details — such as the direction to avoid alcohol or driving or using heavy
machinery.
When Your Appetite Goes Haywire:
Eating Disorders
An eating disorder is a psychological illness that leads you to eat either too
much or too little. Indulging in a hot fudge sundae once in a while is not an
eating disorder. Neither is dieting for three weeks so that you can fit into last
year’s dress this New Year’s Eve.
The difference between normal indulgence and normal dieting to lose weight
versus an eating disorder is that the first two are acceptable, healthy behav-
ior while an eating disorder is a potentially life-threatening illness that
requires immediate medical attention.
Eating too much
Although many recent studies document an alarming worldwide increase in
obesity, particularly among young children, not everyone who is larger or
heavier than the current American ideal has an eating disorder. Human bodies
come in many different sizes, and some healthy people are just naturally larger
or heavier than others. An eating disorder may be present, though, when
 A person continually confuses the desire for food (appetite) with the
need for food (hunger)
 A person who has access to a normal diet experiences psychological dis-
tress when denied food
 A person uses food to relieve anxiety provoked by what he or she con-
siders a scary situation — a new job, a party, ordinary criticism, or a
deadline
Traditionally, doctors have found that treating obesity successfully is difficult
(see Chapter 3). However, recent research suggests that some people overeat
in response to irregularities in the production of chemicals that regulate sati-
ety (your feeling of fullness). This research may open the path to new kinds
of drugs that can control extreme appetite, thus reducing the incidence of
obesity-related disorders such as arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure,
and heart disease.
194
Part III: Healthy Eating 

Bingeing, purging, and starving:
Unhealthy relationships to food
Some people relieve their anxiety not by eating but by refusing to eat or by
regurgitating food after they’ve eaten it. The first kind of behavior is called
anorexia nervosa; the second, bulimia.
Anorexia nervosa (voluntary starvation), the eating disorder that sidelined
Mary-Kate Olsen in 2004, is virtually unknown in places where food is hard 
to come by. It seems to be an affliction of affluence, most likely to strike the
young and well-to-do. It’s nine times more common among women than
among men.
Many doctors who specialize in treating people with eating disorders suggest
that anorexia nervosa may be an attempt to control one’s life by rejecting a
developing body. In other words, by starving themselves, anorexic girls avoid
developing breasts and hips, and anorexic boys avoid developing the broad
wedge-shape adult male body. By not growing wide, both hope to avoid grow-
ing up.
Left untreated, anorexia nervosa can end in death by starvation.
A second form of eating disorder is bulimia. Unlike people with anorexia, indi-
viduals with bulimia don’t refuse to eat. In fact, they may often binge (con-
sume enormous amounts of food in one sitting: a whole chicken, several pints
of ice cream, a whole loaf of bread).
But bulimic people don’t want to keep the food they eat in their bodies. They
may use laxatives to increase defecation, but the more common method they
use for getting rid of food is regurgitation. Bulimic people may simply retire
to the bathroom after eating and stick their fingers into their throats to make
themselves throw up. Or they may use emetics (drugs that induce vomiting).
Either way, danger looms.
The human body is not designed for repeated stuffing followed by regurgita-
tion. Bingeing may dilate the stomach to the point of rupture; constant vomit-
ing may severely irritate or even tear through the lining of the esophagus
(throat). In addition, the continued use of large quantities of emetics may
result in a life-threatening loss of potassium that triggers irregular heartbeat
or heart failure, factors that contributed to the 1983 death of singer Karen
Carpenter, an anorexic/bulimic who — at one point in her disease — weighed
only 80 pounds but still saw herself as overweight. One symptom of anorexia
and/or bulimia is the inability to look in a mirror and see yourself as you really
are. Even at their most skeletal, people with these eating disorders perceive
themselves as grossly fat.

In This Chapter
 Looking at how taste works
 Understanding why foods taste good (or bad)
 Evaluating health’s effects on taste
 Adapting to new foods and flavors
N
utritionally speaking, taste is the ability to perceive flavors in food and
beverages. Preference is the appreciation of one food and distaste of
another. Decisions about taste are physical reactions that are dependent on
specialized body organs called taste buds. Although your culture has a
decided influence on what you think is good to eat, decisions about food pref-
erences may also depend on your genes, your medical history, and your per-
sonal reactions to specific foods.
Tackling Taste: How Your Brain 
and Tongue Work Together
Your taste buds are sensory organs that enable you to perceive different fla-
vors in food — in other words, to taste the food you eat.
Taste buds (also referred to as taste papillae) are not flowers. They’re tiny
bumps on the surface of your tongue (see Figure 15-1). Each one contains
groups of receptor cells that anchor an antennalike structure called a micro-
villus, which projects up through a gap (or pore) in the center of the taste
bud, sort of like a thread sticking through the hole in Life Savers candy. (For
more about the microvilli and how they behave in your digestive tract, see
Chapter 2.)
The microvilli in your taste buds transmit messages from flavor chemicals in
the food along nerve fibers to your brain, which translates the messages into
perceptions: “Oh, wow, that’s good,” or “Man, that’s awful.”

The four (maybe five) basic flavors
Your taste buds definitely recognize four basic flavors: sweet, sour, bitter,
and salty. Some people add a fifth basic flavor to this list. It’s called umami, a
Japanese word describing richness or a savory flavor associated with certain
amino acids such as glutamates — I talk more about monosodium glutamate
(MSG) later in this section — and soy products such as tofu.
Early on, scientists thought that everyone had specific taste buds for specific
flavors: sweet taste buds for sweets, sour taste buds for sour, and so on. How-
ever, the prevailing theory today is that groups of taste buds work together
so that flavor chemicals in food link up with chemical bonds in taste buds to
create patterns that you recognize as sweet, sour, bitter, and salt. The tech-
nical term for this process is across-fiber pattern theory of gustatory coding.
Receptor patterns for the fave four (sweet, sour, bitter, salt) have been tenta-
tively identified, but the pattern for umami remains elusive.
Flavors are not frivolous. They’re one of the factors that enable you to enjoy
food. In fact, flavors are so important that MSG is used to make food taste
better. MSG, most often found in food prepared in Chinese restaurants, stimu-
lates brain cells. People who are sensitive to MSG may actually develop Chinese
restaurant syndrome, which is characterized by tight facial muscles, headache,
nausea, and sweating caused by overbouncy brain cells. Very large doses of
MSG given to lab rats have been lethal, and the compound is banned from baby
food. However, no real evidence indicates that a little MSG is a problem for
Figure 15-1:

198
Part III: Healthy Eating 

people who aren’t sensitive to it. Which leaves only one question: How does
MSG work? Does it enhance existing flavors or simply add that umami flavor on
its own? Believe it or not, right now nobody knows. Sorry about that.
Your health and your taste buds
Some illnesses and medicines alter your ability to taste foods. The result may
be partial or total ageusia (the medical term for loss of taste). Or you may
experience flavor confusion — meaning that you mix up flavors, translating
sour as bitter, or sweet as salt, or vice versa.
Table 15-1 lists some medical conditions that affect your sense of taste.

smell, you can’t really taste. As anyone who’s
ever had a cold knows, when your nose is
stuffed and your sense of smell is deadened,
almost everything tastes like plain old cotton.
Don’t have a cold? You can test this theory by
closing your eyes, pinching your nostrils shut,
and having someone put a tiny piece of either a
raw onion or a fresh apple into your mouth. Bet
you can’t tell which is which without looking —
or sniffing!
Food color is also an important clue to what
you’ll enjoy eating. Repeated studies show that
when testers change the expected color of
foods, people find them (the foods, not the
testers) less appealing. For example, blue
mashed potatoes or green beef lose to plain old
white mashed potatoes and red meat every
time.

Tricking your taste buds
Combining foods can short-circuit your taste buds’ ability to identify flavors
correctly. For example, when you sip wine (even an apparently smooth and
silky one), your taste buds say, “Hey, that alcohol’s sharp.” Take a bite of
cheese first, and the wine tastes smoother (less acidic) because the cheese’s
fat and protein molecules coat your receptor cells so that acidic wine mole-
cules cannot connect.
A similar phenomenon occurs during serial wine tastings (tasting many
wines, one after another). Try two equally dry, acidic wines, and the second
seems mellower because acid molecules from the first one fill up space on
the chemical bonds that perceive acidity. Drink a sweet wine after a dry one,
and the sweetness often is more pronounced.
Here’s another way to fool your taste buds: Eat an artichoke. The meaty part
at the base of the artichoke leaves contains cynarin, a sweet-tasting chemical
that makes any food you taste after the artichoke taste sweeter.
Determining Deliciousness
When it comes to deciding what tastes good, all human beings and most ani-
mals have four things in common: They like sweets, crave salt, go for the fat,
and avoid the bitter (at least at first).
These choices are rooted deep in biology and evolution. In fact, you can say
that whenever you reach for something that you consider good to eat, the
entire human race — especially your own individual ancestors — reaches
with you.
Listening to your body
Here’s something to chew on: The foods that taste good — sweet foods, salty
foods, fatty foods — are essential for a healthy body.
 Sweet foods are a source of quick energy because their sugars can be con-
verted quickly to glucose, the molecule that your body burns for energy.
(Check out Chapter 8 for an explanation of how your body uses sugars.)
Better yet, sweet foods make you feel good. Eating them tells your brain to
release natural painkillers called endorphins. Sweet foods may also stimu-
late an increase in blood levels of adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the
adrenal glands. Adrenaline sometimes is labeled the fight-or-flight hormone
because it’s secreted more heavily when you feel threatened and must
decide whether to stand your ground — fight — or hurry away — flight.

 Salt is vital to life. As Chapter 13 explains, salt enables your body to
maintain its fluid balance and to regulate chemicals called electrolytes
that give your nerve cells the power needed to fire electrical charges
that energize your muscles, power up your organs, and transmit mes-
sages from your brain.
 Fatty foods are even richer in calories (energy) than sugars. So the fact
that you want them most when you’re very hungry comes as no sur-
prise. (Chapter 2 and Chapter 7 explain how you use fats for energy.)
 Which fatty food you want may depend on your sex. Several studies 
suggest that women like their fats with sugar — Hey, where’s the choco-
late? Men, on the other hand, seem to prefer their fat with salt — Bring
on the fries!
Loving the food you’re with: 
Geography and taste
Marvin Harris was an anthropologist with a special interest in the history of
food. In a perfectly delightful book called Good to Eat: Riddles of Food and
Culture (Simon & Schuster, 1986), Harris posed this interesting situation:

Suppose you live in a forest where someone has pinned $20 and $1 bills to
the upper branches of the trees. Which will you reach for? The $20 bills, of
course. But wait. Suppose that only a couple of $20 bills are pinned to branches
among millions and millions of $1 bills. Does that change the picture? You
betcha.
Searching for food is hard work. You don’t want to spend so much time and
energy searching for food that you end up using more calories than the food
that you find can provide. Substitute “chickens” for $20 bills and “large
insects” for $1 bills, and you can see why people who live in places where
insects far outnumber the chickens spend their time and energy on picking
off the plentiful high-protein bugs rather than chasing after the occasional
chicken — although they wouldn’t turn it down if it fell into the pot.
So, you may say that Harris’s first rule of food choice is that people tend to
eat and enjoy what is easily available, which explains the differences in
cuisines in different parts of the world.
Here’s a second rule: For a food to be appealing (good to eat), it must be both
nutritious and relatively easy or economical to produce.
A food that meets one test but not the other is likely to be off the list. For
example:
 The human stomach cannot extract nutrients from grass. So even
though grass grows here, there, and everywhere, under ordinary circum-
stances, grass never ends up in your salad.
 Cows are harder to raise than plants, especially under the hot South
Asian sun; pigs eat what people do, so they compete for your food
supply. In other words, although they’re highly nutritious, sometimes
neither the cow nor the pig is economical to produce. This anthropologi-
cal explanation is a reasonable argument for why some cultures have
prohibited the use of pigs and cows as food.
Taking offense to tastes
Virtually everyone instinctively dislikes bitter foods, at least at first tasting.
This dislike is a protective mechanism. Bitter foods are often poisonous, so
disliking stuff that tastes bitter is a primitive but effective way to eliminate
potentially toxic food.
According to Linda Bartoshuk, Ph.D., professor of surgery (otolaryngology)
at the Yale University School of Medicine, about two-thirds of all human
202
Part III: Healthy Eating 

beings carry a gene that makes them especially sensitive to bitter flavors.
This gene may have given their ancestors a leg up in surviving their evolu-
tionary food trials.
People with this gene can taste very small concentrations of a chemical called
phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). Because PTC is potentially toxic, Dr. Bartoshuk
tests for the trait by having people taste a piece of paper impregnated with 
6-n-propylthiouracil, a thyroid medication whose flavor and chemical struc-
ture are similar to PTC. People who say the paper tastes bitter are called PTC
tasters. People who taste only paper are called PTC nontasters.
If you’re a PTC taster, you’re likely to find the taste of saccharin, caffeine, the
salt substitute potassium chloride, and the food preservatives sodium ben-
zoate and potassium benzoate really nasty. The same is true for the flavor
chemicals common to cruciferous vegetables — members of the mustard
family, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, and
radishes.
No such ambivalence exists among people who’ve gotten truly sick — I’m
talking nausea and vomiting here — after eating a specific food. When that
happens, you’ll probably come to like its flavor less. Sometimes, says psy-
chologist Alexandra W. Logue, author of The Psychology of Eating and Drinking,
your revulsion may be so strong that you’ll never try the food again — even
when you know that what actually made you sick was something else entirely,
like riding a roller coaster just before eating, or having the flu, or taking a
drug whose side effects upset your stomach.
If you’re allergic to a food or have a metabolic problem that makes digesting
it hard for you, you may eat the food less frequently, but you’ll enjoy it as
much as everyone else does. For example, people who cannot digest lactose,
the sugar in milk, may end up gassy every time they eat ice cream, but they
still like the way the ice cream tastes.
Does it matter whether you like your food? Yes, of course, it does. The simple
act of putting food into your mouth needs to stimulate the flow of saliva and
the secretion of enzymes that you need to digest the food. Some studies sug-
gest that if you really like your food, your pancreas may release as much as
30 times its normal amount of digestive enzymes.
However, if you truly loathe what you’re eating, your body may refuse to take
it in. No saliva flows; your mouth becomes so dry that you may not even be
able to swallow the food. If you do manage to choke it down, your stomach
muscles and your digestive tract may convulse in an effort to be rid of the
awful stuff.

Chapter 15: Why You Like the Foods You Like

Changing the Menu: Adapting 
to Exotic Foods
New foods are an adventure. As a rule, people may not like them the first time
around, but in time — and with patience — what once seemed strange can
become just another dish at dinner.
Learning to like unusual foods
Exposure to different people and cultures often expands your taste horizons.
Some taboos — horsemeat, snake, dog — may simply be too emotion-laden
to be overcome. Others with no emotional baggage fall to experience. Most
people hate very salty, very bitter, very acidic, or very slippery foods such as
caviar, coffee, Scotch whisky, and oysters on first taste, but many later learn
to enjoy them.
Coming to terms with these foods can be both physically and psychologically
rewarding:
 Many bitter foods, such as coffee and unsweetened chocolate, are rela-
tively mild stimulants that temporarily improve mood and physical 
performance.
 Strongly flavored foods, such as salty caviar, offer a challenge to the
taste buds.
 Foods such as oysters, which may seem totally disgusting the first time
you see or taste them, are symbols of wealth or worldliness. Trying
them implies a certain sophistication in the way you face life.
Happily, an educated, adventurous sense of taste can be a pleasure that lasts
as long as you live. Professional tea tasters, wine tasters, and others (maybe
you?) who have developed the ability to recognize even the smallest differ-
ences among flavors continue to enjoy their gift well into old age. Although
your sense of taste declines as you grow older, you can keep it perking as
long as you supply the stimuli in the form of tasty, well-seasoned food.
In other words, as they say about adult life’s other major sensory delight,
“Use it or lose it.”

Stirring the stew: The culinary 
benefits of immigration
If you’re lucky enough to live in a place that attracts many immigrants, your
dining experience is flavored by the favorite foods of other people (meaning
the foods of other cultures). In the United States, for example, the melting pot
is not an idle phrase. American cooking literally bubbles with contributions
from every group that’s ever stepped ashore in what President Lyndon
Baines Johnson used to call the “good ole U. S. of A.”
Table 15-2 lists some of the foods and food combinations characteristic of
specific ethnic/regional cuisines. Imagine how few you might sample living in
a place where everybody shares exactly the same ethnic, racial, or religious
backgrounds. Just thinking about it is enough to make me want to stand up
and shout, “Hooray for diversity at the dinner table!” (Check out Figure 15-2
for the visuals!)

What Is a Healthful Diet?
In This Chapter
 Introducing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005
 Establishing a healthful lifestyle
 Using good judgment when choosing foods
 Handling foods safely
 Applying the guidelines realistically
T
he American Heart Association says to limit your consumption of fats and
cholesterol. The American Cancer Society says to eat more fiber. The
National Research Council says to watch out for fats, sugar, and salt. The
American Diabetes Association says to eat regular meals so your blood sugar
stays even. The Food Police say if it tastes good, forget it!
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services have
incorporated virtually all but the “tastes good, forget it” rule into the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2005 and even added some advisories of their own.
Before you begin reading this chapter, make sure you have a couple book-
marks or something else to hold your place — the material here often refers
to information in other chapters, so you may have to skip back and forth.
What Are Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans?
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is a collection of sensible suggestions
first published by the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human
Services (USDA/HHS) in 1980, with five revised editions since then (1985,
1990, 1995, 2000, 2005).

As the first chapter of the 2005 edition explains, the Guidelines lay out food
and lifestyle choices that promote good health, provide the energy for an
active life, and may reduce the risk or severity of chronic illnesses, such as
diabetes and heart disease. These suggestions are organized as nine stand-
alone chapters, but for convenience’s sake — and because it seems logical —
I’ve grouped them into three categories: “Controlling Your Weight,” “Making
Smart Food Choices,” and “Keeping Food Safe to Eat.”
From now on, when I refer you to a chapter — such as “check back in
Chapter 8” — I’m talking about a chapter in Nutrition For Dummies, not in
Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. Onward!
210
Part III: Healthy Eating 
Comparing Guidelines
My personal favorite among the many editions
of the Dietary Guidelines is the 2000 edition. Its
greatest virtue is that it seemed to have been
written by real people who actually liked food.
You could see this right up front in the very first
paragraph, which began: “Eating is one of life’s
greatest pleasures.” Hallelujah!
Contrast that with the first sentence of the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005: “The
Dietary Guidelines for Americans [Dietary
Guidelines], first published in 1980, provides 
science-based advice to promote health and
reduce risk for chronic disease through diet and
physical activity.”
Alas, what you see is what you get: A frankly
cranky, bare bones, chilly presentation of the
facts. Where the section and chapter section
titles in 2000 were nicely encouraging (“Aim for
a healthy weight,” “Build a Healthy Base,” and
so on) 2005’s are plain clunky (“Weight Man-
agement,” “Adequate Nutrients within Calorie
Need,” and the like).
Perhaps sensing a small disconnect between
them (the people who wrote the Guidelines) and
you (the person who’s supposed to read them),
the USDA/HHA team put its shoulders back to
the wheel and its fingers back on the keyboard
to create Finding Your Way to a Healthier You, a
neat little brochure that summarizes the Guide-
lines for civilians. Well, one out of two ain’t bad.
To read and/or download the Dietary Guidelines

and choose the appropriate listing.

Office either by phone (866-512-1800) or online

no “www” in that Net address.

Controlling Your Weight
During the past two decades, as the number of overweight Americans has
bounced upward like a rubber ball, the incidence of obesity-related conditions
such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease also has risen.
The challenge (as always) is to set, reach, and hold a healthful weight. Three
chapters in the new Dietary Guidelines (“Adequate Nutrients within Calorie
Needs,” “Weight Management,” and “Physical Activities”) lay out some clear,
um, guidelines.
Getting the most nutritious calories
Some foods provide lots of nutrients per calorie. Some don’t. The former are
called “nutrient-dense foods.” The latter aren’t.
As you may expect, the Guidelines recommend choosing foods from the first
group to meet your calorie needs each day, while limiting the amount of
 Foods high in saturated fat
 Foods high in trans fats
 Foods high in cholesterol
 Foods with added sugar
 Foods with added salt
 Alcohol beverages
In other words, stick to a balanced diet. No surprise there. And for a list of
superstar foods, check out Chapter 28, which is — this is a surprise! — titled
“Twelve Superstar Foods.”
Managing your weight
To reach and keep a healthful weight, follow a few realistic rules:
 Evaluate your weight. The best test of who’s actually overweight is the
Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of body fat versus body lean mass (in
other words, muscle) that can be used to predict health outcomes. You
can read all about BMI in Chapter 3. So if you haven’t already done so,
211
Chapter 16: What Is a Healthful Diet?

turn back to Chapter 3 and read, read, read, but come right back here
when you’re done.
 If you need to lose weight, do so gradually. Forget the “lose 30 pounds
in 30 days” jazz. Depending on how much weight you have to lose, your
long-term goal needs to be losing about 10 percent of your total weight
over a 6-month period. Losing 1⁄2 to 2 pounds a week is a safe and practi-
cal way of doing so.
 Encourage healthy weight in children. One unhappy fact is that over-
weight kids become overweight adults. Helping children stick to a
healthy weight pays large dividends down the road of life.
 Check with your doctor before starting a weight loss diet. This advice
is most important for women who are pregnant or nursing, for children,
and for anyone — young or old — who has a chronic disease and/or is
on medication.
Being physically active
When you take in more calories from food than you use up running your
body systems (heart, lungs, brain, and so forth) and doing a day’s physical
work, you end up storing the extra calories as body fat. In other words, you
gain weight. The reverse also is true. When you spend more energy in a day
than you take in as food, you pull the extra energy you need out of stored fat
and you lose weight.
I’m no mathematician, but I can reduce this principle to two simple equations
in which E stands for energy (in calories), > stands for greater than, < stands
for less than, and W stands for the change in weight:
If Ein > Eout: Etotal = +W
If Ein< Eout: Etotal = –W
It ain’t Einstein’s theory of relativity, but you get the picture!
For real-life examples of how the energy-in, energy-out theory works, stick your
bookmark in this page and go to Table 3-1 in Chapter 3 to find out how to calcu-
late the number of calories a person can consume each day without pushing
up the poundage. Even being mildly active increases the number of calories
you can wolf down without gaining weight. The more strenuous the activity,
the more plentiful the calorie allowance. Suppose that you’re a 25-year-old man
who weighs 140 pounds. The formula in Table 3-1 shows that you require 1,652
calories a day to run your body systems. Clearly, you need more calories for
doing your daily physical work, simply moving around, or exercising.
212
Part III: Healthy Eating 

After you decide to start moving, the Guidelines say, do it every day. How
much should you do? Per the Guidelines:
 Most people will benefit from 30 minutes of moderate physical activity —
such as a brisk walk — per day.
213
Chapter 16: What Is a Healthful Diet?
Other reasons to exercise
Weight control is a good reason to step up your
exercise level, but it isn’t the only one. Here are
four more:
 Exercise increases muscles. When you
exercise regularly, you end up with more
muscle tissue than the average bear.
Because muscle tissue weighs more than
fat tissue, athletes (even weekend warrior
types) may end up weighing more than they
did before they started exercising to lose
weight. But a higher muscle-to-fat ratio is
healthier and more important in the long run
than actual weight in pounds. Exercise that
changes your body’s ratio of muscle to fat
gives you a leg up in the longevity race.
 Exercise reduces the amount of fat stored
in your body. People who are fat around the
middle as opposed to the hips (in other
words an apple shape versus a pear shape)
are at higher risk of weight-related illness.
Exercise helps reduce abdominal fat and
thus lowers your risk of weight-related dis-
eases. Use a tape measure to identify your
own body type by comparing your waistline
to your hips (around the buttocks). If your
waist (abdomen) is bigger, you’re an apple.
If your hips are bigger, you’re a pear.
 Exercise strengthens your bones. Osteo-
porosis (thinning of the bones that leads to
repeated fractures) doesn’t happen only to
little old ladies. True, on average, a woman’s
bones thin faster and more dramatically
than a man’s, but after the mid-30s, every-
body — male and female — begins losing
bone density. Exercise can slow, halt, or in
some cases even reverse the process. In
addition, being physically active develops
muscles that help support bones. Stronger
bones equal less risk of fracture, which, in
turn, equals less risk of potentially fatal
complications.
 Exercise increases brainpower. You know
that aerobic exercise increases the flow of
oxygen to the heart, but did you also know
that it increases the flow of oxygen to the
brain?
When a rush job (or a rush of anxiety) keeps
you up all night, a judicious exercise break
can keep you bright until dawn. According
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology
nutrition research scientist Judith J.
Wurtman, Ph.D., when you’re awake and
working during hours that you’d normally be
asleep, your internal body rhythms tell your
body to cool down, even though your brain
is racing along. Simply standing up and
stretching, walking around the room, or
doing a couple of sit-ups every hour or so
speeds up your metabolism, warms up your
muscles, increases your ability to stay
awake, and, in Dr. Wurtman’s words, “pro-
longs your ability to work smart into the
night.” Eureka!

 To manage body weight and/or prevent gradual weight gain, make it 60
minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity several days a week.
 To keep weight off, try 60 to 90 minutes of daily moderate physical activity.
 To reach true physical fitness, your regimen should include cardiovascu-
lar conditioning, stretching exercises for flexibility, and resistance exer-
cises or calisthenics for muscle strength and endurance.
Not everybody can — or should — run right out and start chopping down
trees or throwing touchdown passes to control his or her weight. In fact, if
you have gained a lot of weight recently, have been overweight for a long
time, haven’t exercised in a while, or have a chronic medical condition, you
need to check with your doctor before starting any new regimen. (Caution:
Check out of any health club that puts you right on the floor without first
checking your vital signs — heartbeat, respiration, and so forth.)
Making Smart Food Choices
Okay. So you have your weight goals firmly in mind and three, or four, or even
seven times a week, you manage to Hup! Two, three, four at home, or in the
gym, or on a walk around the block. The next task set forth by the Guidelines
is to put together a diet that supports your new healthy lifestyle.
The Guidelines has five chapters designed to simplify your task: “Food Groups
to Encourage,” “Fats,” “Carbohydrates,” “Sodium and Potassium,” and
“Alcoholic Beverages.”
Picking the perfect plants
From the beginning, way back in 1980, the various editions of the Guidelines
have recommended that you build your diet on a base of plant foods. Why?
Because plant foods
 Add plenty of bulk but few calories to your diet, so you feel full without
adding weight
 Are usually low in fat and have no cholesterol, which means they reduce
your risk of heart disease
 Are high in fiber, which reduces the risk of heart disease; prevents con-
stipation; reduces the risk of developing hemorrhoids (or at least makes
existing ones less painful); moves food quickly through your digestive
tract, thus reducing the risk of diverticular disease (inflammation
caused by food getting caught in the folds of your intestines and causing
214
Part III: Healthy Eating 

tiny out-pouchings of the weakened gut wall); and may lower your risk of
some gastrointestinal cancers.
 Are rich in beneficial substances called phytochemicals, which may
reduce your risk of heart disease and some forms of cancer (for more,
see Chapter 12)
For all these reasons, the Guidelines recommend that a basic 2,000 calorie
daily diet include
 2 cups of fruit
 2.5 cups of vegetables (include dark green, orange, and starchy veggies,
plus beans)
 3 or more 1-ounce servings of whole grain products
To protect your bones, the Guidelines advise washing down your plants with
3 daily cups of low-fat milk (349 milligrams calcium) or fat-free milk (306 mil-
ligrams calcium) or the equivalent amount of milk products such as cheddar
cheese, which has 204 milligrams calcium per ounce. For more on calcium,
mark this page and flip to Chapter 11.
Figuring out fats
As you can plainly see in Chapter 7, dietary fat (the fat in foods) is an essen-
tial nutrient. Infants need these fats to thrive, and the same cholesterol that
may increase an adult’s risk of heart disease is vital to an embryo’s healthy
development, triggering the action of genes that tells cells to become special-
ized body structures — arms, legs, backbone, and so forth.
Grown-ups, however, need to control fat intake so they can control calories
and reduce the risk of obesity-related illnesses, such as heart disease, dia-
betes, and some forms of cancer.
Overall, the Guidelines suggest that your adult diet derive no more than 35
percent of its calories from fat and no more than 10 percent of calories from
saturated fat and that it deliver 300 milligrams or less of cholesterol a day. To
reach these goals
 Most of your fat calories should come from foods such as fish, nuts, and
vegetable oils that are rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.
 Dairy products, such as milk, should be low- or no-fat (skim).
 Poultry and meat should be lean (yes, trim off that visible fat).
 With trans fats, less is always better.
215
Chapter 16: What Is a Healthful Diet?

Counting on carbs
Carbs are your fastest source of energy, but the trick here is to get your carbs
complex (I explain complex versus simple carbs in Chapter 8), which means
from plant foods: fruits and vegetables and whole grains. The companion
stratagem is to buy and prepare foods with little added sugar.
Together, these two simple steps help control weight, provide vital nutrients,
and — as the Guidelines slyly note — “reduce the incidence of dental caries”
(cavities). Next!
Limiting salt, balancing potassium
Sodium is a mineral that helps regulate your body’s fluid balance, the flow of
water into and out of every cell described in Chapter 13. This balance keeps
just enough water inside the cell so that it can perform its daily jobs but not
so much that the cell — packed to bursting — explodes.
Most people have no problems with sodium. They eat a lot one day, a little
less the next, and their bodies adjust. Others, however, don’t react so evenly.
For them, a high-sodium diet appears to increase the risk of high blood pres-
sure. When you already have high blood pressure, you can tell fairly quickly
whether lowering the amount of salt in your diet lowers your blood pressure.
But no test is available at this point for telling whether someone who doesn’t
have high blood pressure will develop it by consuming a diet that’s high in
sodium.
Because limiting sodium intake to a moderate level won’t harm anyone, the
guidelines advocate avoiding excessive amounts of salt. Doing so helps
reduce blood pressure levels for people who are salt-sensitive.
What’s moderate use? According to the Guidelines, you should consume less
than 2,300 milligrams (approximately 1 teaspoon of salt) of sodium per day.
The easiest way to reach that goal is to choose and prepare foods with very
little added salt. At the same time, it pays to consume potassium-rich foods,
such as (what else?) fruits and vegetables, because an adequate supply of
potassium helps control blood pressure.
By the way, moderating your salt intake has another, unadvertised benefit. It
may lower your weight a bit. Why? Because sodium is hydrophilic (hydro =
water; philic = loving). Sodium attracts and holds water. When you eat less
salt, you retain less water, you’re less bloated, and you feel thinner.
Don’t reduce salt intake drastically without first checking with your doctor.
Remember, sodium is an essential nutrient, and the Guidelines advocate mod-
erate use, and not no use at all.

Where’s the sodium?
The foods with the highest amounts of naturally
occurring sodium are natural cheeses, sea fish,
and shellfish. Some foods are low in sodium but
pick up plenty of salt when they’re processed.
For example, one cup of cooked fresh green
peas has about 2 milligrams (mg) sodium, but
one cup of canned peas may have 493 mg
sodium. To be fair, most canned and processed
vegetables are now available in low-sodium
versions, too. The difference is notable: One cup
of low-sodium canned peas has 8 mg of sodium,
485 mg less than regular canned peas.
You also get added sodium in the salt on snack
foods, such as potato chips and peanuts, not to
mention the salt you add yourself from the
shaker that’s on virtually every American table.
Not all the sodium you swallow is sodium chlo-
ride. Sodium compounds also are used as
preservatives, thickeners, and buffers (chemi-
cals that smooth down acidity).

Moderating alcohol consumption
Telling someone to drink alcohol beverages in moderation sounds like Mom-
and-apple-pie advice, right? Right. But — and you’ve heard this song before —
what’s moderation, anyway? Laypersons (you and me, babe) may define mod-
erate in terms of the effects that alcohol has on the ability to perform simple
tasks, such as speaking and thinking clearly or moving in a straight line. Obvi-
ously, if the amount of alcohol you drink makes you slur your words or bump
into the furniture, that isn’t moderation.
The Dietary Guidelines define moderate drinking as one drink a day for a
woman and two drinks a day for a man. Aha, you say, but what’s one drink?
Good question. Here’s the answer:
 12 ounces of regular beer (150 calories)
 5 ounces of wine (100 calories)
 11⁄2 ounces of 80-proof (40 percent alcohol) distilled spirits (100 calories)
Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of
Agriculture, 2005)
218
Part III: Healthy Eating 

Some people shouldn’t drink at all, not even in moderation, including people
who suffer from alcoholism, people who plan to drive a car or take part in
other activities that require attention to detail or real physical skill, and
people using medication (prescription drugs or over-the-counter products).
For information about who should and should not drink, as well as a list of
drugs that interact with alcohol, take a look at Chapter 9.
Keeping Food Safe to Eat
In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that
spoiled or contaminated food causes about 76 million illnesses — 325,000 of
them serious enough to require hospitalization — and 5,000 deaths every year
in the United States. Three years later, the USDA blamed Salmonella organisms
alone for more than 3.5 million American stomachaches — or worse.
Clearly, keeping food safe to eat is an important goal. To do that, here’s an
equation any careful cook can rely on:
Clean stores + clean hands + clean kitchen + proper storage + proper tem-
perature = safe food
That’s the short version of the Guidelines’ guidelines. For more details about
exactly how to keep food safe from store to dinner plate, stick a bookmark in
this page and flip forward to Chapters 19, 20, and 21. Imagine! Four chapters
with info about one subject. Sort of tells you how important it is, doesn’t it?
Right now, raw is in but not — as the Guidelines explain — necessarily health-
ful. To reduce your risk of picking up an icky bacterial disease along with
dinner, the Guidelines advise avoiding raw (unpasteurized) milk or any prod-
ucts made from unpasteurized milk; raw or partially cooked eggs or any dish
containing raw eggs; raw or undercooked meat and poultry; unpasteurized
juices; and raw sprouts.
Okay, Now Relax
Life is not a test. You don’t lose points for failing to follow the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2005 every single day of your life. Nobody’s perfect,
and the Guidelines are meant to be broken — once in a while.
For example, ideally you should hold your daily intake of dietary fat to 20 to
35 percent of your total calories. But you can bet that you’ll exceed that

amount this Saturday when you stroll by the buffet at your best friend’s wed-
ding and see Camembert cheese (70 percent of the calories from fat), sirloin
steak (56 percent of the calories from fat), salad with Thousand Island dress-
ing (90 percent of the calories from fat), and whipped cream cake (I can’t
count that high).
Is this a crisis? Should you stay home? Must you keep your mouth shut tight
all night? Are you kidding? Here’s the Real Rule: Let the good times roll every
once in a while. After the party’s over, compensate.
For the rest of the week, go back to your exercise regimen and back to your
healthful menu emphasizing lots of the nutritious, delicious, low- or no-fat
foods that should make up most of your regular diet.
In the end, you’re likely to have averaged out to a desirable amount with no
fuss and no muss and be right in line with that headline from the first page of
the 2000 Guidelines that I mention at the beginning of this chapter: “Eating is
one of life’s greatest pleasures.” Amen to that.

T
his chapter features the new Food Guide Pyramid and the Nutrition Facts
labels — and it tells you how to use them to create a healthful diet.
But consider yourself warned: The following pages are packed with numbers
and details, maybe more than you ever wanted to know about your daily
bread — and everything else on your plate. Don’t let the many, many facts
and stats turn you off. The information you find here really is useful for
making good food choices. Take a deep breath, keep your highlighter handy,
and jump right in.
Playing with Blocks: Basics of 
the Food Pyramids
Food pyramids are comprised of building blocks for grown-ups. Instead of 
letters in the alphabet, these blocks represent food groups that you can put
together to create a picture of a healthful diet.
The essential message of all good guides to healthful food choices is that no one
food is either good or bad — how much and how often you eat a food is what
counts. With that in mind, a food pyramid delivers three important messages:
 Variety: The fact that the pyramid contains several blocks tells you that
no single food gives you all the nutrients you need.
 Moderation: Having blocks smaller than others tells you that although
every food is valuable, some — such as fats and sweets — are best con-
sumed in small amounts.

 Balance: You can’t build a pyramid with a set of identical blocks. Blocks
of different sizes show that a healthful diet is balanced: the right amount
from each food group.
Clearly, the virtue of a food pyramid is that using it enables you to eat practi-
cally everything you like — as long as you follow the recommendations on
how much and how frequently (or infrequently) to eat it.
The original USDA Food Guide Pyramid
The first food pyramid was created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) in 1992 in response to criticism that the previous government guide
to food choices — the Four Food Group Plan (vegetables and fruits, breads
and cereals, milk and milk products, meat and meat alternatives) — was too
heavily weighted toward high-fat, high-cholesterol foods from animals.
Figure 17-1 depicts the original USDA Food Guide Pyramid. As you can see,
this pyramid is based on daily food choices, showing you which foods are in
what groups. Unlike the Four Food Group Plan, the pyramid separates fruits
and vegetables into two distinct groups and lists the number of servings from
each food group that you should have each day. (The number of servings is
provided in ranges. The lower end is for people who consume about 1,600
calories a day, and the upper end is for people whose daily dietary intake
nears 3,000 calories.)
How much is a serving? Not to worry. That’s spelled out in Table 17-1.

One useful aspect of the original USDA Food Guide Pyramid is its recommen-
dation of different numbers of daily servings for people consuming different
amounts of calories each day. For example, consider how the recommended
number of servings from the bread group varies at different levels of calorie
consumption.
Table 17-2 lists the original USDA serving recommendations for three levels of
calorie consumption:
 1,600 calories per day (sufficient for women who don’t exercise and for
many older adults)
 2,200 calories per day (meets the needs of most children, active women,
and many sedentary men)
 2,800 calories per day (provides the energy required by most teenage
boys, many active men, and some very active women)

Okay, now stare at the original Food Guide Pyramid and the servings charts
until they’re burned into your brain. Then move on . . . to the spanking 
new version of the Food Guide Pyramid on a new interactive Web site,
www.MyPyramid.gov.
The brand new 2005 USDA 
Food Guide Pyramid
By the time USDA/HHS got around to revising the Dietary Guidelines for 2005,
it was pretty clear that the original food pyramid hadn’t done its proposed
job of teaching most Americans how to choose foods that provide sufficient
nutrients without piling on the pounds.

What to do? What else? In a word, MyPyramid (see Figure 17-2).
Courtesy of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Like the original Food Guide Pyramid, this new version is made up of sections
representing the foods in your daily diet — from left to right, grains, vegeta-
bles, fruit, oils, milk, and meat/beans.
Like the building blocks on the original Food Guide Pyramid, the six bands on
this one say “pick lots of different kinds of foods to build a better diet.” The
different sizes of the sections suggest that you should consume more of some
foods than others. The steps going up the side of the pyramid say, “Physical
activity matters, so get moving!”
And the MyPyramid slogan, “Steps to a Healthier You,” tells you that you
don’t have to leap tall buildings in a single bound like Superman (or woman)
to improve your nutrition. Even small steps can make a big difference.
But the big deal about MyPyramid is that you can personalize the 
diagram to meet your own special needs. For more information, visit

Chapter 17: Making Wise Food Choices
A word to the wise reader
Call me foolish. Call me old-fashioned. Call me a
fan of the simplest solution. But when it comes to
assembling a healthful diet, the original Food
Guide Pyramid with its neat building blocks and
list of ex-act-ly how many servings I need each
day works best. Yes, interacting with MyPyramid
is fun, sort of like a slot machine where you push
in the nickels and get back a quarter. Or two. But
what with meeting deadlines for my editors and
making dinner for my husband and Katy the ami-
able cat, I’d rather use my fun time to read a good
book than to calculate what constitutes 
5.5 ounces of meat or a cup of veggies.
MyPyramid.gov says your government promises
to make the site even more glitzy in the future with
cyber bells and whistles that’ll enable you to
assemble meals with specific servings of specific
foods, like one baked apple or one ham sandwich
or one glass of skim milk. Ex-cuseme, but you can
do that yourself right now by checking the serv-
ings published along with the original Food Guide
Pyramid and listed for your convenience a few
pages back in this very chapter.
Better yet, the original Food Guide Pyramid is
infinitely adaptable, offering a simple method for
accommodating virtually any healthful eating
plan. For example, look at how easy it is to use
to original pyramid to follow the veggie-fruit-
pasta-and-unsaturated-fat Mediterranean Diet:
Which proves — to me at least — that newer
ain’t always better. Ah, well.

ent food groups, including recommended daily amounts. For Professionals
includes a downloadable worksheet that helps you track what you’re really
eating — as opposed to what you sorta remember you ate the day before 
yesterday.
Understanding the Nutrition Facts Labels
Once upon a time, the only reliable consumer information on a food label was
the name of the food inside. The 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act
changed that forever with a spiffy new set of consumer-friendly food labels
that include
 A mini-nutrition guide that shows the food’s nutrient content and evalu-
ates its place in a balanced diet
 Accurate ingredient listings, with all ingredients listed in order of their
weight in the food; for example, the most prominent ingredient in a loaf
of bread would be flour
 Clear identification of ingredients previously listed simply as colorings
and sweeteners
 Scientifically reliable information about the relationship between spe-
cific foods and specific chronic health conditions, such as heart disease
and cancer
The Nutrition Facts label is required by law for more than 90 percent of all
processed, packaged foods, everything from canned soup to fresh pasteur-
ized orange juice. Food sold in really small packages — a pack of gum, for
example — can omit the nutrition label but must carry a telephone number
or address so that an inquisitive consumer (you) can call or write for the
information.
Just about the only processed foods exempted from the nutrition labeling
regulations are those with no appreciable amounts of nutrients or those
whose content varies from batch to batch:
 Plain (unflavored) coffee and tea
 Some spices and flavorings
 Deli and bakery items prepared fresh in the store where they’re sold
directly to the consumer, as well as food produced by small companies
 Food sold in restaurants, unless it makes a nutrition content or health
claim (How do you eat well when eating out? Check out Chapter 18.)
228
Part III: Healthy Eating 

Labels are voluntary for fresh raw meat, fish, or poultry and fresh fruits and
vegetables, but many markets — perhaps under pressure from customers
(Hint! Hint!) — put posters or brochures with generic nutrition information
near the meat counter or produce bins.
Just the facts, ma’am
The star of the Nutrition Facts label is the Nutrition Facts panel on the back
(or side) of the package. This panel features three important elements: serv-
ing sizes, amounts of nutrients per serving, and Percent Daily Value. (See
Figure 17-3.)
Serving size
No need to stretch your brain trying to translate gram-servings or ounce-
servings into real servings. This label does it for you, listing the servings in
comprehensible kitchen terms such as one cup or one waffle or two pieces 
or one teaspoon. It also tells you how many servings are in the package.
The serving size is exactly the same for all products in a category. In other
words, the Nutrition Facts chart enables you to compare at a glance the nutri-
ent content for two different brands of yogurt, cheddar cheese, string beans,
soft drinks, and so on.
Serving size: This varies from package
to package. Serving sizes don’t always reflect the
typical amount that an adult may eat. In some cases,
the serving size may be a very small amount.
Calories: The calories contained in a single serving.
% daily values: The percentage of nutrients that one 
serving contributes to a 2,000-calorie diet. Parents or 
children may need more or less than 2,000 calories per 
day.
Nutrient amounts: The nutritional values of the most 
important, but not all, vitamins and other nutrients in
the product.

Chapter 17: Making Wise Food Choices

When checking the labels, you may think the suggested serving sizes seem
small (especially with so-called low-fat items). Think of these serving sizes 
as useful guides.
Amount per serving
The Nutrition Facts chart tells you the amount (per serving) for several
important factors:
 Calories
 Calories from fat
 Total fat (in grams)
 Saturated fat (in grams)
 Trans fats (in grams)
 Cholesterol (in milligrams)
 Total carbohydrate (in grams)
 Dietary fiber (in grams)
 Sugars (in grams — total sugars, the ones occurring naturally in the food
and the ones added during preparation)
 Protein (in grams)
Percent Daily Value
The Percent Daily Value enables you to judge whether a specific food is high,
medium, or low in fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber,
sugar, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron.
The Percent Daily Value for vitamins and minerals is based on a set of recom-
mendations called the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI), which are similar (but
not identical) to the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins
and minerals discussed in Chapters 10 and 11.
RDIs are based on allowances set in 1973, so some RDIs now may not 
apply to all groups of people. For example, the Daily Value for calcium is
1,000 milligrams, but many studies — and two National Institutes of Health
Conferences — suggest that postmenopausal women who are not using hor-
mone replacement therapy need to consume 1,500 milligrams of calcium a
day to reduce their risk of osteoporosis.
The Percent Daily Values for fats, carbohydrates, protein, sodium, and potas-
sium are based on the Daily Reference Values (DRV). DRVs are standards for
nutrients, such as fat and fiber, known to raise or lower the risk of certain
health conditions, such as heart disease and cancer. For example, the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2005 says that no more than 30 percent of your 
230
Part III: Healthy Eating 

daily calories should come from fat. That means a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet
shouldn’t have any more than 600 calories from fat. To translate fat calories
to grams of fat (the units used in the DRVs), divide the number of calories
from fat (600) by 9 (the number of calories in one gram of fat). The answer,
67, is slightly higher than the actual DRV. But it’s close enough. For more
about the evolving state of dietary recommendations, see Chapter 4. And —
dare I say it? — your daily paper. Boy, is nutrition ever a work-in-progress!
Nutritionists use similar calculations to set the DRVs, such as
 Saturated fat — 10 percent of your calories/9 calories per gram
 Carbohydrates — 60 percent of your calories/4 calories per gram
 Dietary fiber — 11.5 percent of your calories/0 calories per gram
 Protein — 10 percent of your calories/4 calories per gram
Having set down this tidy list, I’m now compelled to tell you that the %DV
(that’s short for Percent Daily Value), as shown on the Nutrition Facts labels,
are behind the times. New recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans 2005 say
 Total fat calories should account for 20 to 35 percent of total daily 
calories.
 No safe level exists for saturated fats or trans fats, thus no %DV is pro-
vided for either one.
The total amount of saturated fat in the portion is the number of grams
of sat fat plus the number of grams of trans fat. (Who else would tell you
these things?)
 Calories from carbs should account for 45 to 65 percent of daily calories.
 Women younger than 50 need to consume 25 grams of dietary fiber a
day; men younger than 50, 38 grams. After age 51, it’s 21 grams for
women and 30 grams for men.
 Calories from protein should account for 10 to 35 percent of total daily
calories, an amount much higher than the current RDA for protein.
Will this change the numbers on the Nutrition Facts labels? The sensible
answer is, sure it will . . . eventually. Are the current Nutrition Facts labels
still useful? Absolutely.
231
Chapter 17: Making Wise Food Choices

Relying on labels: Health claims
Ever since man (and woman) came out of the caves, people have been
making health claims for certain foods. These folk remedies may be comfort-
ing, but the evidence to support them is mostly anecdotal: “I had a cold. My
mom gave me chicken soup, and here I am, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
Of course, it did take a week to get rid of the cold completely. . . .”
On the other hand, health claims approved by the USDA and the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for inclusion on the new food labels are another
matter entirely. If you see a statement suggesting that a particular food or
nutrient plays a role in reducing your risk of a specific medical condition, you
can be absolutely 100 percent sure that a real relationship exists between the
food and the medical condition. You can also be sure that scientific evidence
from well-designed studies supports the claim.
In other words, USDA/FDA-approved health claims are medically sound and
scientifically specific. They highlight the known relationships between
 Calcium and bone density: A label describing a food as “high in cal-
cium” may truthfully say: “A diet high in calcium helps women maintain
healthy bones and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life.”
 A diet high in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol and a higher risk of
heart disease: A label describing a food as “low-fat, low cholesterol,” or
“no fat, no cholesterol” may truthfully say: “This food follows the recom-
mendations of the American Heart Association’s diet to lower the risk of
heart disease.”
 A high-fiber diet and a lower risk of some kinds of cancer: A label
describing a food as “high-fiber” may truthfully say: “Foods high in
dietary fiber may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer.”
 A high-fiber diet and a lower risk of heart attack: A label describing a
food as “high-fiber” may truthfully say: “Foods high in dietary fiber may
help reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.”
 Sodium and hypertension (high blood pressure): A label describing a
food as “low-sodium” may truthfully say: “A diet low in sodium may
reduce the risk of high blood pressure.”
 A fruit-and-vegetable-rich diet and a low risk of some kinds of cancer:
Labels on fruits and vegetables may truthfully say: “A diet high in fruits
and vegetables may lower your risk of some kinds of cancer.”
 Folic acid (folate) and a lower risk of neural tube (spinal cord) birth
defects such as spina bifida: Labels on folate-rich foods may truthfully
say: “A diet rich in folates during pregnancy lowers the risk of neural
tube defects in the fetus.”

Foods with more than 4 grams saturated fat and/or saturated fat plus trans
fat per serving cannot have any health claims at all on their labels.
How high is high? How low is low?
Today, savvy consumers reach almost automatically for packages labeled
“low fat” or “high fiber.” But it’s a dollars-to-doughnuts sure bet that hardly
one shopper in a thousand knows what “low” and “high” actually mean.
Because these are potent terms that promise real health benefits, the new
labeling law has created strict, science-based definitions:
 High means that one serving provides 20 percent or more of the Daily
Value for a particular nutrient. Other ways to say “high” are “rich in” or
“excellent source,” as in “milk is an excellent source of calcium.”
 Good source means one serving gives you 10 to 19 percent of the Daily
Value for a particular nutrient.
 Light (sometimes written lite) is used in connection with calories, fat, or
sodium. It means the product has one-third fewer calories or 50 percent
less fat or 50 percent less sodium than usually is found in a particular
type of product.
 Low means that the food contains an amount of a nutrient that enables
you to eat several servings without going over the Daily Value for that
nutrient.
• Low-calorie means 40 calories or fewer per serving
• Low-fat means 3 grams of fat or less
• Low saturated fat means less than 0.5 grams trans fat per serving
and 1 gram (or less) saturated fat.
• Low-cholesterol means 20 milligrams or less
 Reduced saturated fat means that the amount of saturated fat plus trans
fat has been reduced more than 25 percent from what’s normal for in the
given food product
 Free means “negligible” — not “none.”
• Calorie-free means fewer than 5 calories per serving
• Fat-free means less than 0.5 grams of fat
233
Chapter 17: Making Wise Food Choices

• Trans fat–free means the food has less than 0.5 grams trans fat and
0.5 grams saturated fat per serving
• Cholesterol-free means less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol or 2
grams or less saturated fat
• Sodium-free or salt-free means less than 5 milligrams of sodium
• Sugar-free means less than 0.5 grams of sugar
Notice something missing? Right, there’s no definition for “low sodium” per
serving. On the other hand, a meal plan with less than 1,000 milligrams sodium
per day is considered a low-sodium diet.

Part III: Healthy Eating 
Organic — the not-quite-finished 
evolution of a label term
“Organic” (as in organic food) is a highly
charged food word. But do you know what it
means? Don’t be embarrassed to say no. Until
recently, neither did most health professionals.
To a chemist, organic means a substance that
contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. By this
chemical standard, all foods — and all human
beings — are organic.
Yet some people adopted the word organic to
describe plant foods grown without pesticides or
synthetic chemicals, or to describe the poultry,
fish, beef, and lamb from animals raised on a diet
with no antibiotics or other medicating chemi-
cals to assure healthy and efficiently producing
animals.
But these descriptions were not standards reg-
ulated by any federal agency. So USDA set out
to create regulations that legally define the term:
 In December 1997, the USDA released its
first proposal on new standards for organic
foods.
 In May 1998, after receiving more than
280,000 comments from the public, food
growers, and food marketers, the agency
announced that although bioengineered
and irradiated foods are safe, they’re not
permitted to carry the organic label.
 In October 1998, the USDA issued three more
proposals on how animals yielding organic
food are to be treated and how the agency
will certify producers of organic foods.
 In October 2002, the USDA implemented
rules saying that foods carrying the organic
label must be grown without pesticides or
raised without non-organic feed.
Sounds simple, sounds good. Sounds . . . not
quite final. Barely four months later, in February
2003, Congress passed legislation allowing
organic livestock to be given non-organic feed
at any time the price of organic feed reaches
two times that of the regular stuff. As I write this
book, the whole darn thing is in a state of flux.
For the latest, check your local newspaper or
visit www.usda.gov to see what you can dig
up. Then, dig in. Maybe.

Listing what’s inside
The extra added attraction on the Nutrition Facts label is the complete ingre-
dient listing, in which every single ingredient is listed in order of its weight 
in the product, heaviest first, lightest last. In addition, the label must spell
out the true identity of some classes of ingredients known to cause allergic
reactions:
 Vegetable proteins (hydrolyzed corn protein rather than the old-fashioned
hydrolyzed vegetable protein)
 Milk products (nondairy products such as coffee whiteners may contain
the milk protein caseinate, which comes from milk)
 FD&C yellow No. 5, a full, formal chemical name instead of coloring
Naming the precise source of sweeteners (corn sugar monohydrate rather
than just sugar monohydrate) is still voluntary, but as is true of information
about raw meat, fish, and poultry, manufacturers and stores just may
respond to consumer pressure. (Repeat advice: Hint! Hint!)
Choosing Foods with MyPyramid 
and the Nutrition Facts Label
The Food Guide Pyramid helps balance meals and snacks. In the kitchen, 
you can increase the nutritional value by thinking of individual dishes as
mini–food pyramids. At snack time, you can use the Food Guide Pyramid 
to choose munchies that are a valuable part of your overall daily diet.
For example, although you know that fruits and veggies are good snacks, that
doesn’t mean that you’re stuck with boring carrot sticks or an apple. The
food pyramid says “fruits and vegetables,” not raw fruits and raw vegetables.
Yes, a fresh apple’s fine. But so is a baked apple (100 calories), fragrant with
cinnamon and decorated with no-fat sour cream (30–45 calories for two table-
spoons). Carrot strips are okay. So are vegetarian baked beans — yes, baked
beans (140 calories plus 26 grams of carbohydrates, 7 grams of protein, 7
grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of fat per 1⁄2 cup serving), which are con-
sidered both veggies and a member of the high-protein meat/beans group.
As for the Nutrition Facts label, you can use that to eat your cake and have it
nutritiously by comparing products to choose the best alternatives.
235
Chapter 17: Making Wise Food Choices

Here’s a good example: You find yourself irresistibly drawn to double dark
chocolate ice cream (lots of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and a whopping
230 calories per 1⁄2 cup serving). But then, just as your hand is opening the
freezer door, ready to reach for the ice cream, suddenly . . . out of the corner
of your eye, you see the Nutrition Facts panel on the label of the no-fat but
equally irresistible chocolate sorbet. It says, “No fat, no saturated fat, no cho-
lesterol, and only 90 to 130 calories per serving.” When you put the labels
side-by-side, do you need to ask which one comes out the winner?
The Final Word on Diagrams and Stats
At the beginning of this chapter, I warned you that keeping track of all the
facts may be difficult. But now I think that you can pretty much boil them all
down to one nutritional Golden Rule exemplified by the food pyramids and
the Nutrition Facts food label: Keep things in proportion.
Come to think of it, that’s not a bad philosophy for life.

 Finding nutritious fast-food favorites
E
ating out is in. You don’t have to cook, and somebody else washes the
dishes. The challenge is to avoid letting luxury lull you into ceding
responsibility for your food choices to some chef whose heart belongs to
butter. This chapter lays out strategies for making your excellent adventure
nutritionally sound. You find out how to edit a menu in a white-tablecloth
restaurant (the food professional’s description of an upscale eatery) to bal-
ance gustatory pleasure with common-sense nutrition. And you figure out
how to juggle fast food so that it fits into a healthful diet. No cooking, no
dishes, no guilt. Who could ask for anything more?
Interpreting a Restaurant Menu
Restaurants are businesses, and that means they respond to consumer
demand. What consumers have demanded for years are rich foods and big
portions, which means that the restaurant concept of a portion or of a healthy
alternative is seriously out of whack with what the nutrition experts recom-
mend. Does that mean you should stop eating out? Heck, no! But it does mean
you need to use caution when navigating a menu.
Pinpointing portions
Restaurants don’t make friends by serving up teensy little portions. In fact,
tiny servings probably sank nouvelle cuisine, the 1980s fad that put one string
bean, three garden peas, half an artichoke heart, and one sliced cherry
tomato on a lettuce leaf and called it the salad course.

Reality dictates that the portions on restaurant plates rarely come within
hailing distance of the official serving sizes issued by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. To protect yourself from humongous servings, you need to store
real-life versions of the recommended portions in your memory banks. To do
that, use an 8-ounce measuring cup and a kitchen scale to run through some
basic practice drills at home:
 Broil a small steak or roast a chicken breast. Use a kitchen scale to
weigh a 3-ounce portion. Does the steak look like a deck of cards? 
How about a small calculator? That’s one serving.
 Boil some rice. After the rice is done, fill the measuring cup to the
halfway mark. Take out the rice and roll it into a tennis ball or a billiard
ball. Whatever. That’s one serving.
 Shred some greens. Fill the measuring cup to the 8-ounce mark. Turn the
greens out onto a salad plate. That’s one serving.
 Open one can of beets or fruit cocktail. Fill the measuring cup to the
halfway mark. Spoon the beets or fruit onto a plate. That’s one serving.
 Open a can of soda. Pour it into the measuring cup, right up to the 
8-ounce mark. Pour that into a glass. Add some ice. It’s probably more
than you get in an upscale restaurant, less than you get at the burger
barn. No matter: It’s still one certified USDA serving.
Now that you have a picture of a serving in your mind, you can slice away the
extra from your restaurant plate — and take it home for lunch or dinner the
next day. That’s what doggie bags are for. (Now that I have my very first cat,
after years and years of adaptable lovable dogs, I know that the sacks are
called doggie bags because cats are too smart — okay, too finicky — to eat
someone else’s leftovers.)
Asking for proof
When the menu says, “Eat me! I’m healthy,” ask for proof. The people who
make and market processed foods are required by law to provide detailed
ingredient labels on their packages. Restaurants ordinarily are exempt. They
don’t have to tell you exactly what’s in the beef Stroganoff or vegetable stir-
fry. The exception is a dish for which the restaurant makes a health claim.
The restaurant may write “low-fat” or “heart-healthy” next to the item on the
menu or mark the entry with a little red heart to signify the same thing. When
a restaurant does this, the Nutrition Education and Labeling Act says the
238
Part III: Healthy Eating 

restaurant has to back up that claim. The law is flexible; it doesn’t require an
ingredient listing on the menu, but it says that the restaurant can comply by
making a notebook available that accomplishes at least one of the following
tasks:
 The notebook can list the nutrient content of each labeled dish or show
that the dish was made according to a recipe from an authoritative pro-
fessional association or dietary group, such as the American Heart
Association.
 The notebook can show that the nutritional values for the dish are based
on a reliable nutrition guide, such as USDA’s voluminous Agriculture
Handbook No. 8, which is made up of several volumes with perhaps a
thousand pages of nutritional analysis for all kinds of food. As with the
new, improved labels on food packages, this policy is designed to make
sure that any food that claims to be healthy actually is.
Making Smart Menu Choices
From a nutritional point of view, restaurant dining has three basic pitfalls:
 Serving sizes are too big.
 Garnishes and side dishes are too rich.
 Meals have too many courses.
Not to worry. Exercise a little care and caution, and you can order from any
menu, secure in the knowledge that pleasing your palate doesn’t mean toss-
ing away all nutritional common sense. The following list of strategies can
make any restaurant experience a joy.
Starting simple
Set the nutritional tone of dinner right off the bat with your choice of appe-
tizer. You have two possible alternatives. The first is opting for a really rich,
high-density food such as pâté de foie gras (literally: fat liver paste) and then
coast downward, calorie-fat-and-cholesterol-wise, for the rest of the meal. A
second alternative is choosing a tasty but low-calorie, low-fat appetizer such
as clear soup, a salad with lemon juice dressing, or shellfish such as shrimp
cocktail (10 to 30 calories a shrimp) with no-fat (catsup/horseradish) sauce.
This choice allows you more food later on.
239
Chapter 18: Eating Smart When Eating Out

Elevating appetizers to entrees
For smaller portion sizes or to skip the calorie-laden sides that come with
most entrees, order an appetizer as your main course. One of my favorite
New York City restaurants, a Mediterranean fish house in the East 40s, serves
an appetizer consisting of a really big (and I mean huge) bowl of maybe 30
steamed mussels in their shells in a low-oil fresh-tomato sauce with one
crusty piece of French bread underneath to sop it up with. When I add a glass
of cold, dry white wine and one more piece of bread, this appetizer becomes
a meal in itself — with a lot fewer calories and less fat than most any entree
on the menu. Less expensive, too.
Skipping the fat on the bread
Don’t butter your bread. Don’t oil it, either. Many chic and trendy restaurants
now serve up a dish of flavored olive oil in place of butter. True, the olive oil
has less saturated fat than butter, and it has no cholesterol, but the calorie
count is exactly the same. All fats and oils (butter, margarine, vegetable oils)
give you about 100 calories a tablespoon. Note: You may get even more calo-
ries from the oil if you do a lot of dipping.
Consumer alert: Don’t assume that your bread is low-fat just because you
didn’t butter it. Many different types of breads come already buttered (or
oiled). One example is foccacia, the thick squares of savory Italian bread.
Others are popovers and muffins.
To test the fat content of your bread, pick up a piece or put it on your napkin.
If your hand feels greasy or the bread leaves an oily spot on your napkin, you
have your answer.
Going naked: Undressed veggies
Victorians boiled vegetables into a yucky muck — no color, no texture, no
taste. Then came 20th century butter, cheese, and cream sauces, often bur-
nished under the broiler to a browned crust. Now, smart restaurant cooks
rely on herbs and spices, reduced (boiled down and thickened) fat-free bouil-
lons, unusual salad combinations, and imaginative treatments such as purees
and kabobs to make their vegetables tasty but trim. The result? Food heaven
and nutrition joy. The vegetable flavors come through, and the calories stay
very, very, very low.
240
Part III: Healthy Eating 

You don’t have to settle for that boring steamed stuff and definitely not veg-
gies so raw they have no taste. The difference between raw cauliflower and
cauliflower that’s been steamed for 15 or 20 minutes and dusted with dill is
so vast that people who insist on passing out the stuff cold should be
charged with vegetable abuse.
To reap the low-calorie rewards, avoid veggie dishes labeled
 Au beurre (with butter)
 Au gratin (with cheese sauce)
 Batter-dipped (eggs, oil, fried)
 Breaded (breadcrumbs, oil, fried)
 Fritters (fried)
 Fritto (fried)
 Hollandaise (sauce with butter and egg yolks)
 Tempura (battered and fried)
Minimizing the main dish
I won’t insult you by telling you to avoid fried foods. If you’re reading this
book, you already know that the best choice is something broiled, baked, or
roasted — without added fat, and with the drippings siphoned off. But I can’t
avoid noting that you can lower the fat content of any main dish simply by
wielding a mean knife and fork to cut away the vestiges of visible fat on your
chops or steak or poultry.
Another approach is to order a main course meat dish without the “main”
part. That is, order your meat, fish, or poultry as a small-serving appetizer,
and then ask your waiter for a veggie entree. Or opt for all the nifty little
extras that usually accompany the meat course, ordering the veggie side
dishes à la carte instead of a veggie entree.
Demand tiny boiled onions. Baby peas with mint. Pickled beets and red 
cabbage. Sugared carrots. Sautéed spinach. Darling little boiled or baked
potatoes with a crust of paprika or cumin. The more, the merrier. The result
may not be entirely fat-free, but it almost certainly has fewer calories, less fat,
more dietary fiber, and a wider variety of vitamins than plain meat or poultry.
241
Chapter 18: Eating Smart When Eating Out

Sidelining sauces
Dining out is a treat, so treat yourself — within reason. You can have your
béarnaise (egg yolks, butter), béchamel (butter, flour, heavy cream), brown
sauce (beef drippings, flour), and hollandaise (butter, egg yolks), as long as
you have them in reasonable amounts.
Ask the waiter to bring the sauce on the side, take one tablespoonful (about 
a soup spoonful), and hand the rest back to the waiter. When ordering from
an Italian menu, the general rule is to avoid the olive-oil-based sauces and
choose the tomato-based red sauce. (If the chef where you’re eating fattens
up the tomato sauce with olive oil, forget this rule.) Many restaurants now
make their red sauces skinny — all tomato, little or no oil.
Satisfying your sweet tooth
After a heavy meal, your body often craves something sweet. Lower your
calories, fat, and so on by splitting a dessert with your dinner partner. Or 
opt for rich but fat-free sweetened coffees: espresso, Greek, and Turkish
brews seem most satisfying. Hate coffee? Have a diet cola.
Discovering the Healthful 
Side of Fast Food
Fast food can be good food. By choosing carefully, you can enjoy burgers while
still meeting recommended daily dietary allowances for all important vitamins
and minerals. A fast-food burger on a bun, plus a salad and a small, low-fat milk
shake, an 8-ounce cup of milk, a small cola, or plain old water may not sound
like great nutrition, but the version served up in fast-food restaurants can actu-
ally be relatively low in fat and relatively high in valuable nutrients.
Choosing wisely at the drive-through
The greatest problem with fast food is very big servings. More food means
more calories — and more you. Several people recently have filed lawsuits
charging the fast-food restaurants made them overeat, which, in turn, made
them overweight. At least one such suit was tossed out of court, but that
doesn’t mean another won’t be filed down the road. So the question of the
242
Part III: Healthy Eating 

day becomes, does a smart cookie like you check your brains at the door
when you enter a fast-food restaurant — or do you have the intelligence 
to choose wisely regardless of where you plunk yourself down for a meal?
Eating smart is a skill you can exercise in any location. For example, Table
18-1 compares the nutrient values of three basic McDonald’s meals. All three
meals derive about 30 percent of their calories from fat (although all three
dish up about one-third the percent Daily Value for artery-clogging saturated
fat). They’re relatively low in cholesterol and provide plenty of vitamin A, 
vitamin C, and bone-building calcium. And the servings are reasonable:
 The burger is the basic, small, no-frills hamburger.
 The salad is a Caesar salad (no chicken) with one packet of Newman’s
Own low-fat balsamic vinaigrette dressing.
 The parfait is the Fruit ’n Yogurt without granola.
 The milk is an 8-ounce container of low-fat (l percent) milk.
 The cola is a 16-ounce cup (small).
The initials DV stand for Daily Value, a nutritional guideline suggesting how
much of each nutrient you need each day on a 2,000-calorie diet. For the com-
plete skinny on the DV and how it’s used on food labels, check out Chapter 17.
Stop! Before you bite into that burger, remember that the following chart is
only a guide. Menus and ingredients may change, so check the nutrition
brochure at your local burger haven, and do it every single time. You never
know when something new will pop up on your plate.

Trans fat: The Boooo! factor
Once upon a time, fast-food restaurants —
indeed, most restaurants — fried up their foods
in butter, which is loaded with the saturated fat
and cholesterol that gum up your arteries and
increase your risk of heart disease. Then, prod-
ded by the Food Police, restaurants switched to
vegetable fats, which are lower in saturated fat
and have no cholesterol. Hooray? Well, not
exactly. Instead of using heart-healthy veg-
etable oils, fast-food restaurants sometimes use
solid vegetable shortenings, and that’s a crucial
difference. The shortenings are solid because
they contain hydrogenated vegetable oils.
Chapter 7 explains the chemistry of hydrogena-
tion (adding hydrogen atoms to fats).
Hydrogenated vegetable oils are high in trans
fatty acids, a form of fat that may clog your
arteries as badly as saturated fats and choles-
terol. With trans fats in the mix, an order of fries
may have as much artery-hostile fat as a 4-
ounce burger. Boooo!

why frozen carrots are mushy when you defrost them?

no more. Just shift your eyes to the right to find out what
happens when you cook, freeze, dry, or zap food.

S
ay “processed food,” and most people think “cheese spread.” They’re
right, of course. Cheese spread is, in fact, a processed food. But so are
baked potatoes, canned tuna, frozen peas, skim milk, pasteurized orange
juice, and scrambled eggs. In broad terms, food processing is any technique
that alters the natural state of food — everything from cooking to freezing to
pickling to drying and more and more and more.
In this chapter, you can read all about how each form of processing changes
food from a living thing (animal or vegetable) into an integral component of
your healthful diet — and at the same time
 Lengthens shelf life
 Reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses
 Maintains or improves a food’s texture and flavor
 Upgrades the nutritional value of foods
What a set of bonuses!
Preserving Food: Five Methods 
of Processing
Where food is concerned, the term natural doesn’t necessarily translate as
“safe” or “good to eat.” Food spoils (naturally) when microbes living (natu-
rally) on the surface of meat, a carrot, a peach, or whatever reproduce 
(naturally) to a population level that overwhelms the food.

Sometimes you can see, feel, or smell when this is happening. You can see
mold growing on cheese, feel how meat or chicken turns slippery, and smell
when the milk turns sour. The mold on cheese, slippery slickness on the sur-
face of the meat or chicken, and odor of the milk are caused by exploding
populations of microorganisms. Don’t even argue with them; just throw out
the food.
All food processing is designed to prevent what happens to the chicken (or
the cheese or the milk). It aims to preserve food and extend its shelf life (the
period of time when it’s safe to consume and nutritious) by stemming the 
natural tide of biological destruction. (But wait! Not all microbes are bad
guys. We use “good” ones to ferment milk to yogurt or cheese and to pro-
duce wines and beers.)
Reducing or limiting the growth of food’s natural microbe population not 
only lengthens its shelf life but also lowers the risk of foodborne illnesses.
Increased food safety is a natural consequence of most processing that keep
foods usable longer. This section discusses how food processing works.
For simplicity’s sake, here’s a list of the methods used to extend the shelf life
of food. I explain each method in even more detail in Chapter 20, Chapter 21,
or Chapter 22.
 Temperature methods
• Cooking
• Canning
• Refrigeration
• Freezing
 Air control
• Canning
• Vacuum-packaging
 Moisture control
• Dehydration
• Freeze-drying (a method that combines methods of controlling the
temperature, air, and moisture)
 Chemical methods
• Acidification
• Mold inhibition
• Salting (dry salt or brine)
 Irradiation
 High-pressure processing
250
Part IV: Food Processing 

Temperature control
Exposing food to high heat for a sufficiently long period of time reduces the
natural population of bacterial spoilers and kills microbes that otherwise
may make you sick. For example, pasteurization (heating milk or other liq-
uids such as fruit juice to 145 to 154.4 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes) kills
nearly all disease-causing and most other bacteria, as does high-temperature,
short-time pasteurization (161 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds).
Chilling also protects food. It works by slowing the rate of microbial repro-
duction. For example:
 Milk refrigerated at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or lower may stay fresh for
almost a week because the cold prevents organisms that survived pas-
teurization from reproducing.
 Fresh chicken frozen to 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower may remain safe
for up to 12 months (whole) or 9 months (cut up).
Removing the water
Like all living things, the microbes on food need water to survive. Dehydrate
the food, and the bugs won’t reproduce, which means the food stays edible
longer. That’s the rationale behind raisins, prunes, and pemmican, a dried
mix of meat, fat, and berries adapted from East Coast Native Americans and
served to 18th- and 19th-century sailors of every national stripe. Dehydration
(loss of water) occurs when food is
 Exposed to air and sunlight
 Heated for several hours in a very low (250 degrees Fahrenheit) oven or
is smoked (the smokehouse acts as a very low oven)
251
Chapter 19: What Is Food Processing?
Tantalizing tidbit of food nomenclature
Central American Indians dried meat to produce
chaqui, a name carried north by Spanish explor-
ers who used it to describe the dried meats of
the Southwestern Indians, which eventually
became — you saw this coming, right? — jerky.

Controlling the air flow
Just as microbes need water, most also need air. Reducing the air supply
almost always reduces the bacterial population. The exception is anaerobes
(microorganisms that can live without air), such as botulinum organisms,
which thrive in the absence of air. Go figure!
Foods are protected from air by vacuum-packaging. A vacuum — from 
vacuus, the Latin word for “empty” — is a space with virtually no air. Vacuum-
packaging is done on a container (generally a plastic bag or a glass jar) from
which the air is removed before it’s sealed. When you open a vacuum-packed
container, you hear a sudden little pop as the vacuum is broken.
If there’s no popping sound, the seal has already been broken, allowing air
inside, and that means the food inside may be spoiled or may have been 
tampered with. Do not taste-test: Throw out the entire package, food and all.
Chemical warfare
About two dozen chemicals are used as food additives or food preservatives to
prevent spoilage. (If the mere mention of chemicals or food additives makes
the hair on the back of your neck rise, chill out with Chapter 22.) Here are the
most common chemical preservatives:
 Acidifiers: Most microbes don’t thrive in highly acidic settings, so a
chemical that makes a food more acidic prevents spoilage. Wine and
vinegar are acidifying chemicals, and so are citric acid, the natural
preservative in citrus fruits, and lactic acid, the natural acid in yogurt.
 Mold inhibitors: Sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, and calcium 
propionate slow (but do not entirely stop) the growth of mold on bread.
Sodium benzoate also is used to prevent the growth of molds in cheese,
margarine, and syrups.
 Bacteria-busters: Salt is hydrophilic (hydro = water; phil = loving). When
you cover fresh meat with salt, the salt draws water up and out of the
meat — and up and out of the cells of bacteria living on the meat. Presto:
The bacteria die; the meat dries. And you get to eat corned beef (which
gets its name from the fact that large grains of salt were once called
“corns”).
252
Part IV: Food Processing 

Irradiation
Irradiation is a technique that exposes food to electron beams or to gamma
radiation, a high-energy light stronger than the X-rays your doctor uses to
make a picture of your insides. Gamma rays are ionizing radiation, the kind
that kills living cells. As a result, irradiation prolongs the shelf life of food by
 Killing microbes and insects on plants (wheat, wheat powder, spices,
dry vegetable seasonings)
 Preventing potatoes and onions from producing new sprouts at the eyes
 Slowing the rate at which some fruits ripen
 Killing disease-causing organisms such as Trichinella, Salmonella, E. coli,
and Listeria (the organism responsible for a recent outbreak of food poi-
soning from packaged meats and cold cuts) on meat and poultry
In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA — which had already
approved irradiation for plant foods, pork, and poultry) put its stamp of
approval on irradiating fresh red meat products as a way to enhance, but not
replace, the safe handling and storage of meat in the processing plant, super-
market, and your kitchen. As of 2005, there are also standards for irradiating
fresh and frozen shellfish. And, no, irradiating food does not make the food
radioactive. But you already knew that, right?
Making Food Better and Better for You
Some food processing really does make your food taste better; a well-broiled
steak beats a raw one anytime. Processing also allows you to sample a wide
variety of seasonal foods (mostly fruits and vegetables) all year long, and 
it enables food producers to improve the nutritional status of many basic
foods, such as grains and milk, by enriching or altering them to meet the
needs of modern consumers.
Intensifying flavor and aroma
One advantage of food processing is that it enables you to enjoy things never
seen in nature, such as the ever-popular — and ever criticized — cheese
spread. A more mundane benefit of food processing is that it intensifies
aroma and flavor, almost always for the better. Here’s how:
253
Chapter 19: What Is Food Processing?

 Drying concentrates flavor. A prune has a different, darker, more
intensely sweet flavor than a fresh plum. On the other hand, dried food
can be hard and tough to chew (think beef jerky).
 Heating heightens aroma by quickening the movement of aroma mole-
cules. In fact, your first tantalizing hint of dinner usually is the scent of
cooking food. Chilling has the opposite effect: It slows the movement of
the molecules. To sense the difference, sniff a plate of cold roast beef
versus hot roast beef straight from the oven. Or sniff two glasses of
vodka, one warm, one icy from the freezer. One comes up scent-free; the
other has the olfactory allure of pure gasoline. Guess which is which. Or
you can pass up the guessing and try for yourself. Nothing like firsthand
experience!
 Warming foods intensifies flavors. This development is sometimes ben-
eficial (warm roast beef is somehow more savory than cold roast beef),
sometimes not (warm milk is definitely not as popular as the icy-cold
version).
 Changing the temperature also changes texture. Heating softens some
foods (butternut squash is a good example) and solidifies others (think
eggs). Chilling keeps the fats in pâté firm so the stuff doesn’t melt down
into a puddle on the plate. Ditto for the gelatin that keeps dessert molds
and dinner aspics standing upright.
Adding nutrients
The addition of vitamins and minerals to basic foods has helped eliminate
many once-common nutritional deficiency diseases. The practice is so
common that you take the following for granted:
 Breads, cereals, and grains are given extra B vitamins to replace the vita-
mins lost when whole grains are stripped of their nutrient-rich covering to
make white flour or white rice or degermed cornmeal. Doing so reduces
the risk of the B vitamin–deficiency diseases beriberi and pellagra.
 Breads, cereals, and grains also are given iron to replace what’s lost in
milling and to make it easier for American women to reach the RDA
(Recommended Dietary Allowance) for this important mineral.
 All milk sold in the U.S. has added vitamin D to reduce the risk of the
bone-deforming vitamin D–deficiency diseases rickets (among children)
and osteomalacia (among adults).
 Added fat-free milk proteins turn skim milk — milk from which the fat
has been removed — into a creamier liquid with more calcium but less
fat and cholesterol than whole milk.
254
Part IV: Food Processing 

Combining benefits
Adding genes from one food (such as corn) to another food (such as toma-
toes) may make the second food taste better and stay fresh longer. You can
bet your bottom flapjack that this is one hot topic, so for more about genetic
engineering at the dinner table, check out Chapter 22.
Faking It: Alternative Foods
In addition to its many other benefits, food processing offers you some
totally fake but widely appreciated substitute fats and sweeteners. Actually,
these may be just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Two years ago, the Brits
sprang Quorn, food made from fungi (yes, fungi) on an unsuspecting U.S.
public. Quorn seems to have slipped back into the nutritional netherworld,
but as processing becomes more adventurous, who knows what strange and
wonderful dishes lie just beyond the entrance to the Nutritional Twilight
Zone? Dum-de-dum-dum . . .
Alternative foods No. 1: Fake fats
Fat carries desirable flavors and makes food “rich.” But it’s also high in calo-
ries, and some fats (the saturated kind described in Chapter 7) can clog your
arteries. One way to deal with this problem is to eliminate the fat from food
(as in skim milk). Another way is to head for the food lab and create a no- or
low-calorie, nonclogging substitute, such as Olestra/Olean or Simplesse.
Olestra/Olean
Olestra/Olean is a no-calorie compound made from sugar and vegetable oils.
Olestra is indigestible, which means it adds no nutrients — such as fat or
cholesterol — to food. Unfortunately, as it speeds through your intestinal
tract, it’s likely to pick up and swoosh along some fat-soluble nutrients such
as vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E. In addition, eating excess amounts of
food made with Olestra may cause diarrhea.
In 1996, the FDA approved Olestra’s use in snack foods such as potato chips.
At the time, the agency-required label stated that Olestra may cause abdomi-
nal cramping and loose stools. In the spring of 1998, an 18-member FDA food
advisory committee reaffirmed the agency’s original decision that Olestra is
safe for use in snack foods. The committee concluded that the fat alterna-
tive’s gastrointestinal effects and its effects on your ability to absorb fat-
soluble vitamins do not significantly affect public health. In August 2003, the
FDA, after a scientific review of several studies conducted after foods with
Olestra went on sale, concluded that the statement was no longer required.
255
Chapter 19: What Is Food Processing?

But something’s an ill wind — and a really bad food ingredient — that doesn’t
have at least some redeeming virtues. In 2004, researchers at the University of
Cincinnati and the University of Western Australia treated a patient with chlo-
racne (a skin condition caused by exposure to the toxic chemical dioxin) with
a regimen of — get this — potato chips made with Olestra. The result? The
patient’s skin cleared up and his body level of dioxin went down. A-maz-ing.
For more information about the activities of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety
and Applied Nutrition, which conducted the tests evaluating Olestra, visit the
Web site at vm.cfsan.fda.gov.
Simplesse
Simplesse is a low-calorie fat substitute used in processed foods. It is made
by heating and blending proteins from egg whites and/or milk into extremely
tiny round balls that taste like fat. Simplesse has 1 to 2 calories per gram
versus 9 calories per gram for real fats or oils. Simplesse is not recommended
for young children because they need essential fatty acids found in real fats,
and its use may be problematic for people who are
 Sensitive to milk (the label on a food with Simplesse must carry the
word “milk”)
 Sensitive to eggs
 On low-protein diets (for example, kidney disease patients)
Alternative foods No. 2: 
Substitute sweeteners
Here’s a scientific tidbit. Most substitute sweeteners were discovered by 
accident in laboratories where researchers touched a paper or a pencil, 
then stuck their fingers in their mouths to discover, “Eureka! It’s sweet.” As
Harold McGee wrote in the first edition of his wonderful On Food and Cooking
(Collier Books, 1988), “These stories make one wonder about the standards
of laboratory hygiene.”
Because substitute sweeteners are not absorbed by your body and don’t pro-
vide any nutrients, scientists call them by their proper name: non-nutritive
sweeteners. The best-known (listed in order of their discovery and/or FDA
approval) are:
 Saccharin (Sweet’N Low): This synthetic sweetener was discovered by
accident (the fingers-in-the-mouth syndrome) at Johns Hopkins in 1879.
A ban on saccharin was proposed in 1977, after it was linked to bladder
cancer in rats; however, it’s still on the market, and diabetics who have
used saccharin for years show no excess levels of bladder cancer. That
256
Part IV: Food Processing 

aside, a warning label nevertheless may appear with saccharin-sweetened
products, indicating that it is a mild rodent carcinogen. In December
1998, the executive committee of the National Toxicology Program (NTP)
recommended that saccharin be taken off the list of suspected human
carcinogens, but this step has not yet been taken. Note: Most people
think saccharin is very sweet, but if you hate broccoli, you’re likely to
think saccharin’s bitter. Check out Chapter 15 to see why.
 Cyclamates: These surfaced (on somebody’s finger, of course) in 1937 at
the University of Illinois. They were tied to cancer in laboratory animals
and banned (1969) in the U.S. but not in Canada and many other coun-
tries. Never has any evidence of ill effects in human beings been attrib-
uted to cyclamates, which are available for use as a tabletop sweetener
in Canada. In the U.S., the FDA is currently reconsidering its ban.
 Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet): Another accidental discovery (1965),
aspartame is a combination of two amino acids, aspartic acid and pheny-
lalanine. The problem with aspartame is that during digestion, it breaks
down into its constituent ingredients. The same thing happens when
aspartame is exposed to heat. That’s trouble for people born with a
phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic defect characterized by a lack of 
the enzyme needed to digest phenylalanine. The excess amino acid can
pile up in brain and nerve tissue, leading to mental retardation in young
children.
 Sucralose (Splenda): Sucralose, which was discovered in 1976, is a no-
calorie sweetener made from sugar. But your body doesn’t recognize it
as a carbohydrate or a sugar, so it zips through your intestinal tract
unchanged. More than 100 scientific studies conducted during a 20-year
period attest to its safety, and the FDA has approved its use in a variety
of foods, including baked goods, candies, substitute dairy products, and
frozen desserts.
 Acesulfame-K (Sunett): The K is the chemical symbol for potassium, 
and this artificial sweetener, with a chemical structure similar to saccha-
rin, is found in baked goods, chewing gum, and other food products. In
1998, the FDA approved its use in soft drinks, whose shelf life it seems 
to prolong.
 Neotame: This free-flowing, water-soluble sweetener is derived from
amino acids (the building blocks of protein, the nutrient that stars in
Chapter 6). In 2002, the FDA approved Neotame for use as a tabletop
sweetener (the stuff you put in your coffee), as well as use in jams and
jellies, syrups, puddings and gels, fruits, fruit juices, and non-alcohol
beverages. To date, more than 113 animal and human studies have
shown absolutely no adverse effects.
 Tagatose (Naturlose, Shugr): A white powder made from lactose, the
sugar in milk. In 2003, FDA approved the use of tagatose in cereal, soft
drinks, frozen desserts, candy, chewing gum, and cake frosting. Although
tagatose may cause gastric upset (gas and diarrhea), it can also serve as
an aid to digestion.

A Last Word: Follow That Bird
You can sum up the essence of food processing by following the trail of one
chicken from the farm to your table. (Vegetarians are excused from this 
section.)
A chicken’s first brush with processing comes right after slaughtering. It’s
plucked and shipped off to the food processor or the supermarket, packed 
in ice to slow the natural bacterial decomposition. In the food factory, your
chicken may be boiled and canned whole, or boiled and cut up and canned 
in small portions like tuna fish, or boiled into chicken soup to be canned 
or dehydrated into bouillon cubes, or cooked with veggies and canned as
chicken à la king, or fried and frozen in whole pieces, or roasted, sliced, 
and frozen into a chicken dinner, or . . . you get the picture (and if you don’t,
check out Figure 19-1).
258
Part IV: Food Processing 

When you buy a fresh (raw) chicken instead of a cooked one, you perform
similar rituals in your own kitchen. First, the chicken goes to the refrigerator
(or freezer), then to the stove for thorough cooking to make sure that no
stray bacteria contaminate your dinner table (or you), and then back to the
fridge for the leftovers. In the end, the chicken’s been processed. And you
have eaten. That’s the point of this story.

You can bet that the first cooked dinner was an accident involving some
poor wandering animal and a bolt of lightning that — zap! — charred the
beast into medium sirloin. Then a caveman attracted by the aroma tore off a
sizzled hunk and forthwith offered up the first restaurant rating: “Yum.”
After that, it was but a hop, a skip, and a jump, anthropologically speaking, to
gas ranges, electric broilers, and microwave ovens. This chapter explains
how these handy technologies affect the safety, nutritional value, appear-
ance, flavor, and aroma of the foods that you heat.

Cooking Basics For Dummies, 3rd Edition, (written by Bryan Miller, Marie Rama,
Eve Adamson, and Wolfgang Puck), a compilation of the kind of no-nonsense,

W. Virgil Brown. Wiley publishes both books.
What’s Cooking?
Ever since man discovered fire and how to control cooking — rather than
having to wait for a passing thunderbolt — the human race has generally
relied on three simple ways of heating food:
 An open flame: You hold the food directly over — or under — the flame
or put the food on a griddle on top of the flame. The electric heating coil
is a 20th-century variation on the open flame.

 Hot air: You put the food in a closed box (an oven) and heat the air in
the oven to create high-temperature dry heat.
 Hot liquid: You submerge the food in hot liquid or suspend the food
over the liquid so that it cooks in the steam escaping from the surface.
Cooking food in a wrapper such as aluminum foil combines two methods:
open fire (the grill) or hot air (the oven) plus the steam from the food’s own
juices (hot liquid).
Here are the basic methods used to cook food with heat generated by fire or
an electric coil:
Open Flame
Hot Air
Hot Liquid
Broiling
Baking
Boiling
Grilling
Roasting
Deep-frying
Toasting
Poaching
Simmering
Steaming
Stewing
Cooking with electromagnetic waves
A gas or electric stove generates thermal energy (heat) that warms and cooks
food. A microwave oven generates electromagnetic energy (microwaves) pro-
duced by a device called a magnetron (see Figure 20-1).
Figure 20-1:
Your typical
microwave
oven.
262
Part IV: Food Processing 

Microwaves transmit energy that excites water molecules in food. The water
molecules leap about like hyperactive 3-year-olds, producing friction, which
then produces the heat that cooks the food. The dish holding food in a
microwave oven generally stays cool because it has so few water molecules.
263
Chapter 20: Cooking and Nutrition
How hot is boiling water?
Water is a molecule (H2O) composed of three
atoms: two hydrogen and one oxygen. When
water is exposed to energy (heat), some of the
water molecules vaporize (or separate into their
gaseous components). These vapors collect in
tiny pockets at the bottom of the vessel (pot) in
which the water’s contained. Continued heating
energizes the vapors, and they begin to push up
against the water.
To break through the water’s surface, the
vapors must acquire enough energy to equal
the force (pressure) of the atmosphere (air)
pushing down on the water. The temperature at
which this happens is called the boiling point.
At sea level (elevation: 0 feet), the atmosphere
is heavier (has more oxygen) than at higher ele-
vations. That’s why you breathe more easily in
Miami, Florida, (elevation: 10 feet) than atop
Mount McKinley in Alaska (elevation: 20,320
feet).
The heavier air at sea level exerts more pres-
sure against the surface of the water in your
pot, so making the water boil takes more energy
(higher heat).
At sea level, the boiling point of water is 212
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees on the Celsius —
C — scale). As a general rule, the boiling point
of water drops one degree Fahrenheit for every
500-foot increase in altitude above sea level. In
other words, at an altitude 500 feet above sea
level, the boiling point for water is 211 degrees
Fahrenheit (99.4 degrees Celsius); at 1,000 feet,
it’s 210 degrees Fahrenheit (98.9 degrees
Celsius).
The following chart shows the approximate boil-
ing points for water in specific American cities
at specific altitudes.

bles) is as hot as a fast one (lots of bubbles).

Cooking away contaminants
Many microorganisms that live naturally in food are harmless or even benefi-
cial. For example:
 Lactobacilli (lacto = milk; bacilli = rod-shaped bacteria) are used to
digest sugars in milk and convert the milk to yogurt.
 Nontoxic molds convert milk to blue cheese. The blue ribbons in the
cheese are safe, edible mold.
Some organisms, however, carry the risk of food poisoning. For example:
 Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum), a bad bug that thrives in the
absence of air (as in low-acid, canned food), produces the potentially
fatal toxin that causes botulism.
 Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), which flourishes in raw meat and poul-
try and unpasteurized milk, has been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome,
a paralytic illness that sometimes follows flu infection.
Are you surprised to find out that, every year, several million Americans
experience diarrhea and other more-serious symptoms of food poisoning
after eating food contaminated with such an organism? Take a look at some 
of the incidences of food poisoning in the United States:
 In 2003 alone, the USDA estimated 1,341,873 cases of food poisoning due
to Salmonella.
 Since 1995, the Food and Drug Administration has tracked at least 
19 incidents, 409 cases of reported illness, and two deaths linked to
fresh and freshly cut lettuce and leafy greens contaminated by disease-
causing organisms that were transmitted by exposure to sewage and
animal waste.
 In the winter of 1998–1999, Americans were reported to be suffering ill-
ness and death caused by consumption of packaged meats contami-
nated with Listeria monocytogenes.
This incident was particularly troublesome, because the contaminated
products (packaged meats) were made to be served cold. The only way
to reduce the risk would have been to heat the cold cuts — unlikely
except with hot dogs, which must be boiled or broiled (not microwaved)
to reach a safe internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
Note: During pregnancy, a fetus whose mother consumes Listeria-
contaminated food may suffer damage or, in extreme cases, may die.
 Children and adults have died in this country following consumption of
undercooked chopped meat containing Escherichia coli 0157:H7 (some-
times called pathogenic E. coli).
264
Part IV: Food Processing 

Although simply heating food to the temperatures shown in Table 20-2 is not
a guaranteed protection against food-borne illness, cooking food thoroughly
and keeping it hot (or chilling it quickly) after it has been cooked destroys
many dangerous bugs or slows the rate at which they reproduce, thus reduc-
ing the risk. Table 20-1 lists some common pathogens (disease-causing organ-
isms) linked to foodborne illnesses and notes the foods likely to harbor them;
Table 20-2 shows the recommended safe cooking temperatures for various
foods. Use a food thermometer to make sure you reach the recommended
temps. Because some things are more complicated than they seem, read the
directions that come with the thermometer to be sure you’re doing it right.
Really.

Making Changes: How 
Cooking Affects Food
Cooking foods changes the way they feel, look, taste, and smell. In fact, the
appetizing texture of food, its rich color, intense flavor, and fragrant aroma all
are products of, yes, that’s right: cooking.

Cook me tender: Changing texture
Exposure to heat alters the structures of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, so
it changes food’s texture (the way food particles are linked to make the food
feel hard or soft). In other words, cooking can turn crisp carrots mushy and
soft steak to shoe leather.
Protein
Proteins are made of very long molecules that sometimes fold over into
accordion-like structures (see Chapter 6 for details about proteins). Although
heating food doesn’t lower its protein value, it does
 Break protein molecules into smaller fragments
 Cause protein molecules to unfold and form new bonds to other protein
molecules
 Make proteins clump together
Need an example? Consider the egg. When you cook one, the long protein
molecules in the white unfold, form new connections to other protein mole-
cules, and link up in a network that tightens to squeeze out moisture so that
the egg white hardens and turns opaque. The same unfold-link-squeeze reac-
tion turns translucent poultry firm and white and makes gelatin set. The
longer you heat proteins, the stronger the network becomes, and the tougher,
or more solid, the food will be.
To see this work, scramble two eggs — one beaten and cooked plain and one
beaten with milk and then cooked. Adding liquid (milk) makes squeezing out
all the moisture more difficult for the protein-network. So the egg with the
added milk cooks up softer than the plain egg.
Fat
Heat melts fat, which can run off food, lowering the calorie count. In addition,
cooking breaks down connective tissue — the supporting framework of the
body, which includes some adipose (fatty) tissue — thus making the food
softer and more pliable. You can see this most clearly when cooking fish. The
fish flakes when it’s done because its connective tissue has been destroyed.
When meat and poultry are stored after cooking, their fats continue to change,
this time by picking up oxygen from the air. Oxidized fats have a slightly
rancid taste more politely known as warmed-over flavor. You can slow — but
not entirely prevent — this reaction by cooking and storing meat, fish, and
poultry under a blanket of food rich in antioxidants, chemicals that prevent
other chemicals from reacting with oxygen. Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant,
so gravies and marinades made with tomatoes, citrus fruits, tart cherries, or
blueberries slow the natural oxidation of fats in cooked or stored foods.

Part IV: Food Processing 

Carbohydrates
Cooking has different effects on simple carbohydrates and complex ones (if
you’re confused about carbohydrates, see Chapter 8). When heated
 Simple sugars — such as sucrose or the sugars on the surface of meat
and poultry — caramelize, or melt and turn brown. (Think of crème
caramel.)
 Starch, a complex carbohydrate, becomes more absorbent, which is why
pasta expands and softens in boiling water.
 Some dietary fibers (gums, pectins, hemicellulose) dissolve, so vegeta-
bles and fruits soften when cooked.
The last two reactions — absorption and dissolved cell walls — can improve
the nutritional value of foods by making the nutrients inside previously fiber-
stiffened cells more available to your body.
A less-beneficial effect of heat on carbs surfaced early in 2002 when Swedish
researchers set off a nutritional hoo-ha with the announcement that exposing
starchy carbohydrate foods — such as potatoes and bread — to the high heat
of baking or frying produces acrylamides, a family of chemicals known to
cause cancer in rats. Then things got worse when scientists at the City of
Hope Cancer Research Center (Los Angeles) said that acrylamides could trig-
ger cell changes leading to cancer in human beings. But a 2003 analysis of 
data from a study of 987 cancer patients and 538 healthy “controls” conducted
by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health and the Departments of
Oncology-Pathology and Medical Epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet in
Stockholm shows no evidence of an increased risk of bowel, bladder, or
kidney cancer among fans of fries and toast. And in June 2004, an expert panel
at the National Toxicology Program of the National Institute of Environmental
269
Chapter 20: Cooking and Nutrition
Grains: Split personality performers
In cooking, grains, such as corn, exhibit split
personalities — part protein, part complex car-
bohydrates. When you boil an ear of corn, the
protein molecules inside the kernels do the
break-unfold-network dance (the molecules
break their links, the protein unfolds, and the
molecules form new links). At the same time,
carbohydrate starch granules begin absorbing
moisture and then soften.
The trick to boiling perfect corn is controlling
this process, removing the corn from the water
when starch granules have absorbed enough
moisture to soften the kernels but before the
protein network has tightened.
That’s why cookbooks advise a short stay in the
pot. But if you’re a person who likes corn chewy,
just let it boil away, 15 minutes, 30 minutes — you
be the judge.

Health Sciences said the level of acrylamides in a normal American diet —
even one that includes baked and fried carbs — is too low to be carcinogenic.
Fries on toast, anyone?
At a follow-up U.N.–sponsored meeting in Geneva, a group of really important
international food scientists confirmed the Stockholm discovery of acrylamide
in carbs but couldn’t agree on what to do about it other than to call for another
study, which showed up pretty quickly. By the end of the year, kitchen scien-
tists agreed that moderate amounts of fries are safe. Nutritious, too. The most
healthful potato, it’s true, is one that hasn’t been fried, but even when crisped
to a fare-thee-well, one ounce of potato chips nevertheless may still deliver up
to 12 percent of the RDA for vitamin C, up to 7 percent of the RDA for folate, 
up to 4 percent of the RDA for iron, and more than a gram of dietary fiber. In
other words, as one part of a varied diet, the chip may still be okay to dip. The
problem is: Are you sure you can have just one? Or two? Or . . .
Enhancing flavor and aroma
Heat degrades (breaks apart) flavor and aroma chemicals. As a result, most
cooked food has a more intense flavor and aroma than raw food.
270
Part IV: Food Processing 
Cheeseburgers for your health: A hot story
When you heat fats, their molecules break apart
into chemicals known as free radicals, molecule
fragments that may hook up together to form
potentially carcinogenic (cancer-causing) com-
pounds. These compounds are produced in
higher numbers at higher heats; the usual safe
cutoff is around 500 degrees Fahrenheit (right
before “broil” on the oven dial). Burned fat or
smoking oil, for example, has more nasties than
plain melted fat or oil that is warm but not smoking.
As a result, many nutritionists warn against
eating the crisp, crinkly, absolutely yummy
browned top layer of foods, especially burned
meats, which in 1998 were tentatively linked to a
higher risk of breast cancer in women. Of course,
the theory has yet to be proven, and as is true
with so much in modern nutrition, the story may
be more complicated than it seems at first glance.
Why? Because in 1996, Martha Belury, of Purdue
University, discovered that cheeseburgers —
yes, cheeseburgers . . . grilled, fried, broiled,
whatever — are rich in CLA (short for conju-
gated dienoic linoleic acid), a form of an essen-
tial fatty acid (a topic that I cover in Chapter 7).
In Belury’s lab, CLA slowed or reversed skin,
breast, and stomach cancers in mice at the three
stages of tumor development: early, when the cell
is first damaged; midway in the process, when
precancerous cells multiply to form tumors; and
late, when tumors begin to enlarge and spread to
other organs.
Whether this benefit happens in people nobody
knows, but it sure reminds me of the Woody
Allen movie Sleeper, in which the hero wakes
up at some point in the future to discover that
corned beef sandwiches are health food. Hey,
you can’t make this stuff up!

A good example is the mustard oils that give cruciferous vegetables, such as
cabbage and cauliflower, their distinctive (some may say offensive) odors.
The longer you cook these vegetables, the worse they smell. On the other
hand, heat destroys diallyl disulfide, which is the chemical that gives raw
garlic its bite and bark. So cooked garlic tastes and smells milder than the
raw version.
Altering the palette: Food color
Carotenoids — the natural red and yellow pigments that make carrots and
sweet potatoes orange and tomatoes red — are practically impervious to
heat and the acidity or alkalinity of cooking liquids. No matter how you cook
them or how long, carotenoids stay bright and sunny.
You can’t say the same for the other pigments in food: The other pigments
that make food naturally red, green, or white react — usually for the worse —
to heat, acids (such as wine, vinegar, or tomato juice), and basic (alkaline)
chemicals (such as mineral water or baking soda and water). Here’s a brief
rundown on the color changes that you can expect when you cook food:
 Red beets and cabbage get their colors from pigments called antho-
cyanins. Acids make these pigments redder. Alkaline solutions fade
anthocyanins from red to bluish purple.
 Potatoes, cauliflower, rice, and white onions are white because they con-
tain pigments called anthoxanthins. When anthoxanthins are exposed to
alkaline chemicals (mineralized water or baking soda), they turn yellow
or brownish. Acids prevent this reaction. Boil cauliflower florets in
tomato juice, rinse off the juice, and you’ll see — white cauliflower!
 Green veggies are colored by chlorophyll, a pigment that reacts with
acids in cooking water (or in the vegetable itself) to form pheophytin, a
brown pigment. The only way to short-circuit this reaction is to protect
the vegetables from acids. Old-time cooks added alkaline baking soda,
but that increases the loss of certain vitamins (see “Protecting the
Nutrients in Cooked Foods” later in this chapter) and softens the vegeta-
bles. Fast cooking at high heat or cooking in lots of water (which dilutes
acids) lessens these color changes.
 The natural red color of fresh meat comes from myoglobin in the muscle
tissue and hemoglobin in blood. When meat is heated, the pigment mole-
cules are denatured, or broken into fragments. They lose oxygen and
turn brown or — after long cooking — turn the really unappetizing gray
characteristic of steam-table meats. This inevitable change is more
noticeable in beef than in pork or veal because beef starts out naturally
redder.
271
Chapter 20: Cooking and Nutrition

Choosing Cookware: How Pots and Pans
Affect Food
A pot is a pot is a pot, right? No way! In fact, your choice of pots can affect
the nutrient value of food by
 Adding nutrients to the food
 Slowing the natural loss of nutrients during cooking
 Actively increasing the loss of nutrients during cooking
In addition, some pots make the food’s natural flavors and aromas more
intense, which, in turn, can make the food more — or less — appetizing. Read
on to find out how your pot can change your food. And vice versa.
272
Part IV: Food Processing 
Red to blue and back again
The following experiment lets you see colors
change right before your very eyes. Gather
 1 small can sliced beets
 1 saucepan
 3 small glass bowls
 1 cup water
 1 teaspoon baking soda
 3 tablespoons white vinegar
Line up the glass bowls on your kitchen counter.
Open the can. Remove six slices of beets. Put
two slices in the first glass bowl and four slices
in the saucepan. Put the rest in a small con-
tainer and refrigerate for dinner. No sense wast-
ing good beets!
Mix the baking soda into the water and add this
alkaline solution to the saucepan. Heat for 4
minutes; don’t heat too high — the solution
foams. Turn off the heat. Remove the beets from
the pan. Put two slices each in the second and
third glass bowls.
Ignore the second bowl. Add the vinegar (an acid)
to the third bowl. Wait two minutes. Now look:
The beets in the first bowl (straight from the can)
should still be bright red. Alkaline compounds
darken colors, so the beets in the second bowl,
straight from the baking soda bath, should be
almost navy blue. Acids reverse the reaction, so
beets in the third bowl, with added vinegar,
should be heading back to bright red. Not yet?
Add another tablespoon of vinegar.
Ain’t chemistry grand?

Aluminum
Aluminum is lightweight and conducts heat well. That’s good. But the metal
 Makes some aroma chemicals smellier (particularly those in the crucif-
erous vegetables — cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and so on)
 Flakes off, turning white foods (such as cauliflower or potatoes) yellow
or brownish
Copper
Copper pots heat steadily and evenly. To take advantage of this property,
many aluminum or stainless steel pots are made with a layer of copper sand-
wiched into the bottom. But naked copper is a potentially poisonous metal.
That’s why copper pots are lined with tin or stainless steel. Whenever you
cook with copper, periodically check the lining of the pot. If it’s damaged —
meaning that you can see the orange copper peeking through the silvery
lining — have the pot relined or throw it out.
Ceramics
The chief virtue of plain terra cotta (the orange clay that looks like red
bricks) is its porosity, a fancy way of saying that terra cotta roasting and
baking pans allow excess steam to escape while holding in just enough 
moisture to make bread so moist and chicken such tender pickings.
273
Chapter 20: Cooking and Nutrition
Copper and egg whites: A chemical team
When you whip an egg white, its proteins
unfold, form new bonds, and create a network
that holds air in. That’s why the runny white
turns into stable foam.
You can certainly whip egg whites successfully
in a glass or ceramic bowl — chilled, and
absolutely free of any fat, including egg yolk,
which would prevent the proteins from linking
tightly. But the best choice is copper: the ions
(particles) flaking off the surface bind with and
stabilize the foam. (Aluminum ions stabilize but
darken the whites.)
But wait. Isn’t copper toxic? (See Chapter 11.)
Yes, but the amount you get in an occasional
batch of whites is so small it’s insignificant,
safetywise.

Decorated ceramic vessels are another matter. For one thing, the glaze makes
the pot much less porous, so that meat or poultry cooked in a covered
painted ceramic pan steams instead of roasts. The practical result: a soggy
surface rather than a crisp one.
More importantly, some pigments used to paint or glaze the pots contain
lead. To seal the decoration and prevent lead from leaching into food, the
painted pots are fired (baked in an oven). If the pots are fired in an oven that
isn’t hot enough or if they aren’t fired for a long enough period of time, lead
will leach from ceramics when in contact with acidic foods, such as fruit
juices or foods marinated in wine or vinegar.
Ceramics made in the United States, Japan, and Great Britain generally are
considered safe, but for maximum protection, hedge your bets. Unless the
pot comes with a tag or brochure that specifically says it’s acid-safe, don’t
use it for cooking or storing foods. And always wash decorated ceramics by
hand; repeated passes through the dishwasher can wear down the surface.
Enamelware
Enameled pots are made of metal covered with porcelain, a fine translucent
china. Enamelware heats more slowly and less evenly than plain metal. A
good-quality enameled surface resists discoloration and does not react with
food. But it can chip, and it’s easily marked or scratched by cooking utensils
other than wood or hard plastic. If the surface chips and you can see the
metal underneath, discard the pot lest metals flake into your food.
Glass
Glass is a neutral material that does not react with food. Two cautions with
glass:
 Do not use a glass-and-metal pot in the microwave oven. The metal
blocks microwaves. More importantly, it can cause arcing — a sudden
electrical flare that may damage the oven and scare you out of your wits.
 Remember that glass breaks — sometimes all over the floor. Are you a
person who often drops things? Pass on the glass.
Iron
Like aluminum, iron pots are a good news/bad news item. Iron conducts heat
well and stays hot significantly longer than other pots. It’s easy to clean. It
lasts forever, and it releases iron ions into food, which may improve the nutri-
tional value of dinner.
274
Part IV: Food Processing 

In 1985, nutrition researchers at Texas Tech University in Lubbock set out to
measure the iron content of foods cooked in iron pots. Among their discover-
ies: Beef stew (0.7 milligrams of iron per 100 grams/3.5 ounces, raw) can end
up with as much as 3.4 milligrams of iron per 100 grams after cooking slightly
longer than an hour in an iron pot.
Alas! There’s a downside. The iron that flakes off the pot may be a form of the
mineral that your body can’t absorb. Also, more iron is not necessarily better.
It encourages oxidation (bad for your body) and can contribute to excess
iron storage in people who have hemochromatosis, a condition that leads to
iron buildup that may damage internal organs.
By the way, did I mention that pumping iron is not a bad way to describe the
experience of cooking with iron pots? They’re really, really heavy.
Nonstick
Nonstick surfaces are made of plastic (polytetrafluoroethylene to be exact;
PTFE for short) plus hardeners — chemicals that make the surface, well,
hard. As long as the surface is unscratched and intact, the nonstick surface
does not react with food.
Nonstick pots are a dieter’s delight. They enable you to cook without added
fat, but using them may also lighten your wallet. They scratch easily. Unless
you stick scrupulously to wooden or plastic spoons, your pot can end up
looking like chickens have been stomping on the surface.
Note: Scratched nonstick pots and pans are not a health hazard. If you swallow
tiny pieces of the nonstick coating, they pass through your body undigested.
However, when nonstick surfaces get very hot, they may
 Separate from the metal to which they’re bound (the sides and bottom
of the pot)
 Emit odorless fumes
If the cooking area is not properly ventilated, you may experience poly-
mer fume fever — flu-like symptoms with no known long-term effect. To
prevent this, keep the stove flame moderate and the windows open.
Stainless steel
Stainless steel is an alloy, a substance composed of two or more metals. Its
virtues are hardness and durability; its drawback is poor heat conduction. 
In addition, the alloy includes nickel, a metal to which many people are 
275
Chapter 20: Cooking and Nutrition

sensitive. Finally, stainless steel isn’t really stainless. When exposed to high
heat, stainless steel develops a characteristic multi-hued “rainbow” discol-
oration. Starchy foods, such as pasta and potatoes, may darken the pot.
Undissolved salt can pit the surface. Sorry about that!
If your stainless steel pot is scratched deeply enough to expose the inner
layer under the shiny surface, the metals in the alloy may flake into your
food. So toss the pot.
Plastic and paper
Plastic melts and paper burns, so you obviously can’t use plastic or paper con-
tainers in a stove with an open flame (gas) or heat source (electric). But can
you use them in the microwave? You bet! As long as you pick a proper plastic.
When plastic dishes or plastic wrap are heated in a microwave oven, they
may emit potentially carcinogenic compounds that can migrate into your
food. To reduce your exposure to these compounds, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) says you need to
choose only plastic containers labeled “for microwave oven use.” Thin plastic
storage bags, margarine tubs, and whipped topping bowls are convenient but
way, way off-limits. The American Plastic Council also offers three common-
sense tips for using the right kind of plastics in the microwave:
 Follow the directions on the plastic container or package. If it doesn’t
say “microwaveable,” it isn’t. For example, Styrofoam and other take-out
food carriers rarely are microwaveable, so put the food you’ve ordered
into a different container before reheating it.
 Trays for microwave meals are meant to be used only once; after you
heat the food, toss the tray.
 When covering food to prevent splatters, use microwave-safe plastic
wraps only.
Because the Food and Drug Administration requires microwave-safe plastics
to meet strict safety standards, repeated studies show no ill effects from their
minimal leakage. On the other hand, if even very small exposure makes you
edgy, you can switch to glass or ceramic dishes that are made specifically to
be used in microwave ovens. Splatter-proof the dish with wax paper, parch-
ment paper, or white paper towels labeled safe for microwave use.
For more about plastics in the microwave, visit the USDA’s Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS) Web site at www.fsis.usda.gov or the American
Plastics Council at www.americanplasticscouncil.org (select Plastics &
Food Storage Safety and then click on the link to the “Plastics: Revolutionizing
American Mealtime” document — or simply type “microwave” in the Search
box and follow the prompts).

Part IV: Food Processing 

Protecting the Nutrients in Cooked Foods
Myth: All raw foods are more nutritious than cooked ones.
Fact: Some foods (such as meat, poultry, and eggs) are positively dangerous
when consumed raw (or undercooked). Other foods are less nutritious raw
because they contain substances that destroy or disarm other nutrients. For
example, raw dried beans contain enzyme inhibitors that interfere with the
work of enzymes that enable your body to digest protein. Heating disarms
the enzyme inhibitor.
But there’s no denying that some nutrients are lost when foods are cooked.
Simple strategies such as steaming food rather than boiling, or broiling rather
than frying, can significantly reduce the loss of nutrients when you’re cook-
ing food.
Maintaining minerals
Virtually all minerals are unaffected by heat. Cooked or raw, food has the
same amount of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, iodine, sele-
nium, copper, manganese, chromium, and sodium. The single exception to
this rule is potassium, which — although not affected by heat or air —
escapes from foods into the cooking liquid.
Those volatile vitamins
With the exception of vitamin K and the B vitamin niacin, which are very
stable in food, many vitamins are sensitive and are easily destroyed when
exposed to heat, air, water, or fats (cooking oils). Table 20-3 shows which
nutrients are sensitive to these influences.

To avoid specific types of vitamin loss, keep in mind the following tips:
 Vitamins A, E, and D: To reduce the loss of fat-soluble vitamins A and E,
cook with very little oil. For example, bake or broil vitamin A–rich liver
oil-free instead of frying. Ditto for vitamin D–rich fish.
 B vitamins: Strategies that conserve protein in meat and poultry during
cooking also work to conserve the B vitamins that leak out into cooking
liquid or drippings: Use the cooking liquid in soup or sauce. Caution: Do
not shorten cooking times or use lower temperatures to lessen the loss
of heat-sensitive vitamin B12 from meat, fish, or poultry. These foods
and their drippings must be thoroughly cooked to ensure that they’re
safe to eat.
Do not rinse grains (rice) before cooking unless the package advises you
to do so (some rice does need to be rinsed). Washing rice once may take
away as much as 25 percent of the thiamin (vitamin B1). Toast or bake
cakes and breads only until the crust is light brown to preserve heat-
sensitive Bs.
 Vitamin C: To reduce the loss of water-soluble, oxygen-sensitive vitamin
C, cook fruits and vegetables in the least possible amount of water. For
example, when you cook 1 cup of cabbage in 4 cups of water, the leaves
lose as much as 90 percent of their vitamin C. Reverse the ratio — one
cup water to 4 cups cabbage — and you hold on to more than 50 percent
of the vitamin C.
Serve cooked vegetables quickly: After 24 hours in the fridge, vegetables
lose one-fourth of their vitamin C; after two days, nearly half.
Root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes) baked or boiled
whole, in their skins, retain about 65 percent of their vitamin C.

old air, hot air, no air, and radioactive rays — all can be used to make
food safer for longer periods of time by reducing or eliminating damage
from exposure to air or organisms (microbes) that live on food.
The methods described in this chapter all have one important thing in
common: Used correctly, each process can dramatically lengthen food’s shelf
life. The downside? Nothing’s perfect, so you still have to monitor your food
to make sure that the preservation treatment has, well, preserved it. The fol-
lowing pages tell you how.
Cold Comfort: Chilling and Freezing
Keeping food cold, sometimes very cold, slows or suspends the activity of
microbes bent on digesting your food before you do.
Unlike heat, which actually kills many of the microbes (see Chapter 20), chill-
ing food (or freezing it) may not kill all the microbes, but the cold will reduce
the microbial population to some degree depending on the microflora pre-
sent and will sideline them for a while. For example, mold spores (hibernating
mold organisms) snuggle inside frozen food to sleep quietly like so many
comfy bears inside a wintry cave. When spring comes, the bears bounce back
to life; thaw the food, and the mold does the same.
How long things stay safe in the refrigerator or freezer varies from food to

time). Table 21-1 provides a handy guide to the limits of safe cool storage.
These ranges depend on foods being fresh to start out and on the refrigera-
tor/freezer maintaining a constant temperature. Whenever these conditions
aren’t met, food may spoil more quickly. Use your common sense: If food
seems in any way questionable, throw it out without tasting. Or as the catchy
saying goes: When in doubt, throw it out.

How freezing affects the texture of food
When food freezes, the water inside each cell forms tiny crystals that can
tear cell walls. When the food is thawed, the liquid inside the cell leaks out,
leaving thawed food dryer than fresh food.
Beef that has been frozen, for example, is noticeably dryer than fresh beef.
Dry cheeses, such as cheddar, turn crumbly. Bread dries, too. You can reduce
the loss of moisture by thawing the food in its freezer wrap so that it has a
chance to reabsorb the lost moisture that’s still in the package.
You can’t restore the crispness of vegetables that get their crunch from stiff,
high-fiber cell walls. After ice crystals puncture the walls, the vegetable (car-
rots are a good example) turns mushy. The solution? Remove carrots and
other crunchies, such as cabbage, before freezing the stew.

Refreezing frozen food
The official word from the U.S. Department of Agriculture is that you can
refreeze frozen food — as long as the food still has ice crystals or feels 
refrigerator-cold to the touch.
The personal, unofficial word from me is that I confess to feeling safer when I
simply throw out partially thawed food that I’m not going to use right away.
I’m particularly wary of sauced frozen food, such as frozen macaroni and
cheese, because it seems to me that there just have to be hidden pockets of
thawed food where the bacteria are whooping it up as we speak. Call me a
worrywart, if you will, but for me, following this rule is just easier: Partial
thaw? Out the door.
Canned Food: Keeping Out Contaminants
Food is canned by heating what goes into the container and then sealing the
container to keep out air and microbes. It is then reheated after the can/jar is
sealed. Like cooked food, canned food is subject to changes in appearance
and nutritional content. Heating food often changes its color and texture (see
Chapter 20). It also destroys some vitamin C. But canning effectively destroys
a variety of pathogens, and it deactivates enzymes that might otherwise
cause continued deterioration of the food.
A modern variation on canning is the sealed plastic or aluminum bag known
as the retort pouch. Food sealed in the pouch is heated but for a shorter
period than that required for canning. As a result, the pouch method does 
a better job of preserving flavor, appearance, and heat-sensitive vitamin C.
The sealed can or pouch also protects food from deterioration caused by
light or air, so the seal must remain intact. When the seal is broken, air seeps
into the can or pouch, spoiling the food.
283
Chapter 21: What Happens When Food Is Frozen, Canned, Dried, or Zapped
What’s that brown spot on my burger?
Freezer burn is a dry brownish spot left when
moisture evaporates from the surface of frozen
food. Because freezer burn changes the com-
position of fats on the surface of foods such as
meat and poultry, it may cause some change in
flavor, as well.
To prevent freezer burn, wrap food securely in
freezer paper or aluminum foil and put the item
in a plastic bag. The more air you keep out, the
fewer brown spots will develop.

A more serious hazard associated with canned food is botulism, a potentially
fatal form of food poisoning caused by the failure to heat the food to high-
enough temperatures or for a long-enough time to kill all Clostridium botu-
linum (or C. botulinum) bacteria. Canning is based on temperatures and times
necessary to destroy C. bot spores. C. botulinum is an anaerobic (an = with-
out; aerobic = air) organism that thrives in the absence of oxygen, a condition
nicely fulfilled by a sealed can. Botulinum spores not destroyed by high heat
during the canning process may produce a toxin that can kill by paralyzing
your heart muscles and the muscles that enable you to breathe.
To avoid potentially hazardous canned food do not buy, store, or use any can
that is
 Swollen, which indicates that bacteria are growing inside and 
producing gas
284
Part IV: Food Processing 
The essence of canned food
The technique of canning food in glass contain-
ers was discovered (depending on your source)
either in 1809 or 1810 by Nicholas Appert, a
Frenchman who noted that if he sealed food in a
container while it was heating, the food stayed
edible longer — much longer — than fresh food.
According to Harold McGee, author of On Food
and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the
Kitchen, a wonderful guide to food technology, a
tin of 114-year-old canned meat once was eaten
without making anyone sick. To be fair, I must
note that nobody cried, “Oh, wow, this is good,”
either.
According to Joseph Nathan Kane’s Famous
First Facts (H. W. Wilson Company), the first food
canned in tin — salmon, oysters, and lobsters —
was introduced in 1819 by New Yorkers Ezra
Daggett and Thomas Kensett. Four years later,
Daggett and Kensett took out a patent to “pre-
serve animal substances in tin.” New York inven-
tor J. Osterhoudt later patented the first can with
a key opener on October 2, 1866. (For the most
part, keys have been replaced by pull tabs.) The
first beer in cans (from the Gottfried Krueger
Brewing Company of Newark, New Jersey) went
on sale on January 24, 1935, in Richmond,
Virginia. Pop!

 Damaged, rusted, or deeply dented along the seam, because a break in
the can permits air to enter and may promote the growth of organisms
(other than botulinum)
Consumer alert: Never, never, never taste any food from a swollen or dam-
aged can “just to see if it’s all right.” Remember: When in doubt, throw it out.
Dried Food: No Life without Water
Drying protects food by removing the moisture that bacteria, yeasts, and
molds need to live. Drying is an ancient technique, used to produce the
famous dates of the desert and the dried meat of the American plains.
Drying food the low-tech way means putting it out in the sun and waiting for
it to dry on its own. Drying food the high-tech, modern way means putting
food out on racks and employing fans to quick-dry the food at a low temper-
ature under vacuum pressure.
Another form of drying is spray drying. Spray drying is a technique used to
dry liquids, such as milk, by blowing the liquids (in very small droplets) into
a heated chamber where the droplets dry into a powder that can be reconsti-
tuted (made back into a liquid) by adding water. Instant coffee is a spray-
dried product. So are instant teas and all the various instant fruit beverages.
How drying affects food’s nutritional value
As always, exposure to heat and/or air (oxygen) reduces a food’s vitamin C
content, so dried foods have less vitamin C than fresh foods.
One good example is the plum versus the prune (a dried plum):
 One fresh, medium-size plum, weighing 66 grams (a bit more than 
2 ounces) without the pit, has 6 milligrams vitamin C, 7 to 8 percent 
of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for a healthy adult.
 An equivalent amount of uncooked dried (low-moisture) prunes (66
grams) has only 1.3 milligrams vitamin C.
But wait! Before you leap to the conclusion that fresh is always more nutri-
tious than dried, feed these facts into your memory banks: Dried fruit has
less water than fresh fruit. That means its weight reflects more solid fruit.
Although drying destroys some vitamin C, removing water concentrates
what’s left, along with other nutrients, jamming more calories, dietary fiber,
and/or air-resistant vitamins and minerals into a smaller space.
285
Chapter 21: What Happens When Food Is Frozen, Canned, Dried, or Zapped

As a result, dried food often has surprisingly more nutritional bounce to the
ounce than fresh food. Once again, consider the plum and the prune:
 A medium-size, pit-free plum weighing slightly more than 2 ounces pro-
vides 35 calories, 0.1 milligram iron, and 670 IU (67 RE) vitamin A.
(What’s IU? What’s RE? Check out Chapter 4.)
 Two ounces of uncooked, low-moisture prunes have about 193 calories,
2 milligrams iron, and 952 IU (72 RE) vitamin A. In other words, if you’re
trying to lose weight, you need to be aware that although dried fruit is
low in fat and rich in nutrients, it’s also high in calories.
When dried fruit may be 
hazardous to your health
Many fruits contain an enzyme (polyphenoloxidase) that darkens the fruit
flesh when the fruit is exposed to air. To prevent the fruits from darkening
when dried, the fruits are treated with sulfur compounds known as sulfites.
The sulfites — sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite — can
cause potentially serious allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. For more
about sulfites, see Chapter 22.
Irradiation: A Hot Topic
Irradiation is a technique that exposes food to electron beams or gamma radi-
ation, a high-energy light stronger than the X-rays your doctor uses to make 
a picture of your insides. Gamma rays are ionizing radiation, the kind of radi-
ation that kills living cells. Ionizing radiation can sterilize food or at least 
prolong its shelf life by
 Killing microbes and insects on plants (wheat, wheat powder, spices,
dry vegetable seasonings)
 Killing disease-causing organisms on pork (Trichinella), poultry
(Salmonella), and ground beef (pathogenic E. coli)
 Preventing potatoes and onions from sprouting during storage
 Slowing the rate at which some fruits ripen
Irradiation does not change the way food looks or tastes. It does not change
food texture. It does not make food radioactive. It does, however, alter the
structure of some chemicals in foods, breaking molecules apart to form new
substances called radiolytic products (radio = radiation; lytic = break).
286
Part IV: Food Processing 

About 90 percent of all compounds identified as radiolytic products (RP) also
are found in raw, heated, and/or stored foods that have not been deliberately
exposed to ionizing radiation. A few compounds, called unique radiolytic prod-
ucts (URPs), are found only in irradiated foods.
You can get answers online to the most commonly asked questions about
food irradiation at the Web site maintained by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC): www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/food
irradiation.htm.
Table 21-2 tells you when certain irradiated foods were deemed safe in the U.S.
287
Chapter 21: What Happens When Food Is Frozen, Canned, Dried, or Zapped
Are irradiated foods harmful?
Many scientific organizations, including the
27,000-member Institute of Food Technologists
and an international Expert Committee on the
Wholesomeness of Irradiated Foods (which
includes representatives from the United Nations,
the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the
World Health Organization), believe that irradia-
tion is a safe and important weapon in the fight
against food poisoning caused by microbial and
parasitic contamination.
The Food and Drug Administration has been
approving various uses of food irradiation since
1963. In addition, irradiation is approved for
more than 40 food products in more than 37
countries around the world.
Some consumers, however, remain leery of irra-
diation, fearful that it may expose them to radia-
tion (it can’t; no radioactive residues are present
in irradiated food) or that URPs (unique radiolytic
products) — compounds produced only when
foods are irradiated — may eventually turn out
to be harmful. For now, irradiated food seems
safe, but it’s fair to point out that the story of irra-
diating foods is still unfolding, a situation that
makes many people uneasy. For example, the
FDA’s 2003 decision to allow irradiated ground
beef into the National School Lunch Program has
triggered debates in many school districts; sev-
eral — including Los Angeles and the District of
Columbia — have simply banned irradiated
foods from their menus.
Around the world, all irradiated food is identified
with this international symbol. Just in case that
isn’t enough to get the message across, the
package must also carry the words “treated by
irradiation” or “treated with irradiation.” The only
exception is commercially produced food that
contains some irradiated ingredients, such as
spices. The symbol and/or wording isn’t required,
for example, on the packaging for a frozen pizza
that’s seasoned with irradiated oregano.

Is that food still good to eat? Understanding the
dates on food labels
The following terms can help you figure out
whether you should check whether your food’s
still good or whether you should just pitch it:
 Sell-by: The last date on which the food can
be offered for sale. If stored properly, most
perishable foods such as milk, cheese, and
packaged meats are safe for a few days
past the “sell by” date.
 Best if used by or Use by: Refers to the
food’s flavor and quality, not its safety; the
manufacturer’s recommendation of the last
date on which the food is likely to taste best.
 Expires or Do not use after: The last date on
which a product either provides the highest
nutritional value or works best (for instance,
the last date on which yeast or baking powder
is likely to make your bread or cake rise).
 Packing date: Used on eggs from USDA-
inspected facilities to show the date on
which the eggs were packed. The date is
written as a number from 1 (January 1) to
365 (December 31 — except in a leap year,
naturally). Eggs from USDA-inspected
plants may also carry an expiration date.

f the title of this chapter turns you off, you’re not alone. More people than
you can shake a stick — heck, a whole oak tree — at think that when
you’re talking food, natural’s good and chemical’s bad. Period. But it ain’t
necessarily so.
This chapter is about the natural and synthetic ingredients and the techno-
logical processes that help make food more nutritious; enhance its appear-
ance, flavor, and texture; and keep it fresh on the shelf longer. More to the
point, this chapter explains that without these products and processes,
human beings would still have to gather (or kill) dinner fresh each day to
serve it up fast before it spoils.
And, yes, this chapter talks about new and unusual processes, such as
genetic engineering (which is discussed in the section “Looking Beyond
Additives: Foods Nature Never Made” at the end of this chapter). Try it. 
You may like it.
Exploring the Nature (and Science) 
of Food Additives
What are food additives? Here’s a really simple definition: Food additives are
substances added to food. The list of common food additives includes
 Nutrients
 Coloring agents

 Flavors and flavor enhancers
 Preservatives
Food additives may be natural or synthetic. For example, vitamin C is a 
natural preservative. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxy-
toluene (BHT) are synthetic preservatives. Many people think natural addi-
tives are safer than synthetic ingredients, probably because “synthetic”
seems synonymous with “chemical,” a sort of scary word. Besides, synthetic
additives often have names no one can pronounce, much less translate,
which makes them even more forbidding.
In fact, every single thing in the world is made of chemicals: your body, the
air you breathe, the paper on which this book is printed, and the glasses
through which you read it, not to mention every single bite of food you eat
and every ounce of beverage you drink.
To ensure your safety, the natural and synthetic food additives used in the
United States come only from the group of substances known as the
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list.
All additives on the GRAS list
 Are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning that
agency is satisfied that the additive is safe and effective
 Must be used only in specifically limited amounts
 Must be used to satisfy a specific need in food products, such as protec-
tion against molds
 Must be effective, meaning that they must actually maintain freshness
and safety
 Must be listed accurately on the label
Adding nutrients
One example of a clearly beneficial food additive is vitamin D, which is added
to virtually all milk sold in the United States. Most bread and grain products
are fortified with added B vitamins, plus iron and other essential minerals to
replace what’s lost when whole grains are milled into white flour for white
bread. Some people say that we’d be better off simply sticking to whole
grains. But adding vitamins and minerals to white flours enhances a product
that many people just plain like better. Another example of a nutrient used as
a food additive is the calcium found in some commercially prepared orange
juices.
290
Part IV: Food Processing 

Some nutrients also are useful preservatives. For example, vitamin C is an
antioxidant that slows food spoilage and prevents destructive chemical reac-
tions. Manufacturers must add a form of vitamin C (isoascorbic acid) to bacon
to prevent the formation of potentially cancer-causing compounds.
Adding colors and flavors
Colors, flavoring agents, and flavor enhancers make food look and taste better.
Like other food additives, these three may be either natural or synthetic.
Colors
Coloring agents make food look better. An example of a natural coloring agent
is beta carotene, the natural yellow pigment in many fruits and vegetables.
Beta carotene is used to make margarine (which is naturally white) look like
creamy yellow butter. Other natural coloring agents are annatto, a yellow-to-
pink pigment from a tropical tree; chlorophyll, the green pigment in green
plants; carmine, a reddish extract of cochineal (a pigment from crushed bee-
tles); saffron, a yellow herb; and turmeric, a yellow spice.
An example of a synthetic coloring agent is FD&C Blue No. 1, a bright blue
pigment made from coal tar and used in soft drinks, gelatin, hair dyes, and
face powders, among other things. And, yes, as scientists have discovered
more about the effects of coal-tar dyes, including the fact that some are car-
cinogenic, many of these coloring agents have been banned from use in food
but are still allowed in cosmetics.
To avoid these dyes entirely, read the label and choose foods made with only
natural colors.
Flavors and flavor enhancers
Every cook worth his or her spice cabinet knows about natural flavor ingredi-
ents, especially the most basic natural ones: salt, sugar, vinegar, wine, and
fruit juices.
Artificial flavoring agents reproduce natural flavors. For example, a teaspoon
of fresh lemon juice in the batter lends cheesecake a certain je ne sais quoi
(French for “I don’t know what” — a little something special), but artificial
lemon flavoring works just as well. You can sweeten your morning coffee with
natural sugar or with the artificial sweetener saccharin. (For more about sub-
stitute sweeteners, see Chapter 19.)
Flavor enhancers are a slightly different kettle of fish. They intensify a food’s
natural flavor instead of adding a new one. The best-known flavor enhancer is
monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is widely used in Asian foods. MSG may
trigger headaches and other symptoms in people sensitive to the seasoning.
291
Chapter 22: Better Eating through Chemistry

Adding preservatives
Food spoilage is a totally natural phenomenon. Milk sours. Bread sprouts
mold. Meat and poultry rot. Vegetables lose moisture and wilt. Fats turn
rancid. The first three kinds of spoilage are caused by microbes (bacteria,
mold, and yeasts). The last two happen when food is exposed to oxygen (air).
All preservative techniques — cooking, chilling, canning, freezing, drying —
prevent spoilage either by slowing the growth of the organisms that live on
food or by protecting the food from the effects of oxygen. Chemical preserva-
tives do essentially the same thing:
 Antimicrobials are natural or synthetic preservatives that protect food
by slowing the growth of bacteria, molds, and yeasts.
 Antioxidants are natural or synthetic preservatives that protect food by
preventing food molecules from combining with oxygen (air).
Table 22-1 is a representative list of some common preservative chemicals
and the foods in which they’re found.

Alphabet soup: Understanding artificial colors
When you read the label on a food, drug, or cos-
metic product containing artificial colors, you
may see the letters F, D, and C — as in FD&C
Yellow No. 5. The F stands for food. The D stands
for drugs. The C stands for cosmetics. An addi-
tive whose name includes all three letters can be
used in food, drugs, and cosmetics. An additive
without the F is restricted to use in drugs and
cosmetics or is for external use only (translation:
You don’t take them by mouth). For example, D&C
Green No. 6 is a blue-green coloring agent used
in hair oils and pomades. FD&C Blue No. 2 is a
bright blue coloring agent used in hair rinses, as
well as mint jellies, candies, and cereals.

Naming some other additives in food
Food chemists use a variety of the following types of natural and chemical
additives to improve the texture of food, to keep it smooth, or to prevent mix-
tures from separating:
 Emulsifiers, such as lecithin and polysorbate, keep liquid-plus-solids
such as chocolate pudding from separating into, well, liquid and solids.
They can also keep two unfriendly liquids, such as oil and water, from
divorcing so that our salad dressing stays smooth.
 Stabilizers, such as the alginates (alginic acid) derived from seaweed,
make food such as ice cream feel smoother, richer, or creamier in your
mouth.
 Thickeners are natural gums and starches, such as apple pectin or corn-
starch, that add body to foods.
 Texturizers, such as calcium chloride, keep foods such as canned apples,
tomatoes, or potatoes from turning mushy.
Although many of these additives are derived from foods, their real benefit is
aesthetic (the food looks and tastes better), not nutritional.
Determining the Safety of Food Additives
The safety of any chemical approved for use as a food additive is based on
whether it is
 Toxic
 Carcinogenic
 Allergenic
293
Chapter 22: Better Eating through Chemistry

Defining toxins
A toxin is a poison. Some chemicals, such as cyanide, are toxic (poisonous) 
in very, very small doses. Others, such as sodium ascorbate (a form of vita-
min C), are nontoxic even in very large doses. All chemicals on the GRAS
(Generally Recognized as Safe) list are considered nontoxic in the amounts
that are permitted in food. By the way, did you realize that both examples —
cyanide and vitamin C — are natural chemicals?
Explaining carcinogens
A carcinogen is a substance that causes cancer. In 1958, New York Congressman
James Delaney proposed, and Congress enacted into law, an amendment to
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that banned from food any synthetic chemi-
cal known to cause cancer (in animals or human beings) when ingested in any
amount.
Since then, the only exception to the Delaney clause has been saccharin,
which was exempted in 1970. Although ingesting very large amounts of the
artificial sweetener is known to cause bladder cancer in animals, no similar
link can be found to human cancers. In addition, saccharin provides clear
benefits for people who cannot use sugar. Note: In 1977, Congress required all
products containing saccharin to carry a warning statement: Use of this prod-
uct may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin, which
has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals. This requirement
was lifted in 2000; the warning is no more.
294
Part IV: Food Processing 
The nitrate/nitrite conundrum
Some preservatives are double-edged — good
and not-so-good at the same time. For example,
nitrates and nitrites are effective preservatives
that prevent the growth of disease-bearing
organisms in cured meat. But when they reach
your stomach, nitrates and nitrites react with
natural ammonia compounds called amines to
form nitrosamines, substances known to cause
cancer in animals fed amounts of nitrosamines
much higher than found in any human food.
But guess what? Avoiding foods with added
nitrates and nitrites won’t prevent your having to
cope with nitrosamines. Beets, celery, eggplant,
lettuce, radishes, spinach, and turnip greens all
contain naturally occurring nitrates and nitrites.
When their nitrates and nitrates shake hands in
your stomach they make — you got it! —
nitrosamines.
To take the sting out of added nitrates and nitrites
in foods such as cured meats, USDA, which reg-
ulates meat, fish and poultry, sensibly requires
manufacturers to add an antioxidant vitamin C
compound such as sodium ascorbate or an
antioxidant vitamin E compound (a tocopherol).
The antioxidant vitamins prevent the formation of
nitrosamines while boosting the antimicrobial
powers of the nitrates and nitrites.

As of this writing, the Delaney clause is still in effect, even though many sci-
entists, including cancer specialists, consider it to be outmoded because it
imposes an impossible standard — zero risk — and applies only to synthetic
chemicals. The Delaney clause does not apply to natural chemicals, even
those known to cause cancer, such as aflatoxins, poisons produced by molds
that grow on peanuts.
Listing allergens
Allergens are substances that trigger allergic reactions. Some foods, such as
peanuts, contain natural allergens that can provoke fatal allergic reactions.
The best-known example of an allergenic food additive is sulfites, a group of
preservatives that
 Keep light-colored fruits and vegetables (apples, potatoes) from brown-
ing when exposed to air
 Prevent shellfish (shrimp and lobster) from developing black spots
 Reduce the growth of bacteria in fermenting wine and beer
 Bleach food starches
 Make dough easier to handle
The following is a list of foods that may contain sulfites. (Also see Figure 22-1.)
295

Ruth Papazian, “Sulfites” (FDA Consumer, December 1996)
Sulfites are safe for most people but not for all. In fact, the FDA estimates that
one out of every 100 people is sensitive to these chemicals; among people
with asthma, the number rises to five out of every 100. For people sensitive
to sulfites, even infinitesimally small amounts may trigger a serious allergic

reaction, and asthmatics may develop breathing problems by simply inhaling
fumes from sulfite-treated foods.
The FDA tried banning sulfites from food but lost in a court case brought by
food manufacturers who wanted to use the additive. To protect sulfite-sensi-
tive people, the FDA created rules for safe use of the preservatives. The rules
called for a total ban on sulfites in food at salad bars and a requirement that
sulfites be listed on the label of any food or beverage product with more than
ten parts sulfites to every million parts food (10 ppm). These rules, plus
plenty of press information about the risks of sulfites, have led to a dramatic
decrease in the number of sulfite reactions.

Looking Beyond Additives: Foods 
Nature Never Made
Genetically engineered foods, also known as bioengineered foods, are foods
with extra genes added artificially through special laboratory processes. Like
preservatives, flavor enhancers, and other chemical boosters used in food,
the genes — which may come from plants, animals, or microorganisms such
as bacteria — are used to make foods
 More nutritious
 Better tasting
 More resistant to disease and insects
Genetic engineering may also help plants and animals grow faster and larger,
thus increasing the food supply. And it may enable us to produce foods with
medicines bred right into the food itself. (Check out Chapter 26.)
The Big Question is: Are genetically engineered foods safe? Boy, oh boy, can
you get a fight going over that one! The best answer may be that only time
can tell. As you can imagine, many ordinary people don’t want to wait to find
out. For them, genetically engineered foods are simply unacceptable, charac-
terized dismissively as “frankenfoods” (as in Dr. Frankenstein’s monster).
To permit consumers to make a clear choice — “Yes, I’ll take that biotech
food” or “No, I won’t” — the European Union requires food labels to specifi-
cally state the presence of any genetically altered ingredients. In the United
States, the FDA currently requires wording on labels to alert consumers to
genetic engineering only when it results in an unexpected allergen, such as
corn genes in tomatoes, or changes the nutritional content of a food.
Whether the wording on the label matters to most consumers or whether
most consumers are willing to accept genetically altered foods seems to
depend on whom you ask. The International Food Information Council (IFIC),
a trade group for the food industry, accepts the current label wording rules.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a Washington-based con-
sumer advocacy group, wants to see the words “genetically altered” on all
foods that have been, well, genetically altered. CSPI also wants the FDA to
finalize a rule requiring food marketers to notify the agency in advance when
introducing a new altered food or plant, a policy that’s already in place for
foods from genetically altered animals.
297
Chapter 22: Better Eating through Chemistry

Naturally, each organization has conducted a survey to bolster its point of
view. For example, IFIC’s survey says that nearly two-thirds (61 percent) of
Americans expect food technology to serve up better-quality, better-tasting
food. CSPI’s competing survey says, “Not so fast.” The difference lies in the
questions. The IFIC’s survey questions emphasize the benefits of biotech;
CSPI’s survey questions lean more heavily on the drawbacks. Here are a
couple of comparable questions from the CSPI and IFIC surveys:
1. Question
CSPI Version: Should food labels tell you if a food has been genetically
altered in any way? 70 percent (Yes)
IFIC Version: Would you say you support or oppose FDA’s [current label-
ing] policy? 59 percent (Support)
2. Question
CSPI Version: Would you buy food labeled “genetically engineered”? 43
percent (Yes)
IFIC Version: Would you buy a food if it had been modified by biotechnol-
ogy to taste better or fresher? Or stay fresher? 54 percent (Yes)
In other words, despite a slight wariness about exploring new nutritional
ground, Americans seem intrigued by the promise of food innovations and
are willing to give the whole idea a try. After that, the proof will be in the —
genetically engineered — pudding.

 Exploring differences between food allergy and food intolerance
A
ccording to the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN), at least
11.4 million Americans have true food allergies (also known as food
hypersensitivity); this number includes more children than adults because
many childhood allergies seem to fade with age.
So, you may ask, if allergies are likely to disappear, why do I need a whole
chapter about them? Good question. I have two good answers. First, food
allergies that don’t disappear can trigger reactions ranging from the trivial (a
stuffy nose the day after you eat the food) to the truly dangerous (immediate
respiratory failure). Second, a person with food allergies is likely to be aller-
gic to other things, such as dust, pollen, or the family cat. And forewarned
(about food allergies) is forearmed (against the rest), right? Right.
Finding Out More about Food Allergies
Your immune system is designed to protect your body from harmful invaders,
such as bacteria. Sometimes, however, the system responds to substances nor-
mally considered harmless. The substance that provokes the attack is called an
allergen; the substances that attack the allergen are called antibodies.

A food allergy can provoke such a response as your body releases antibodies
to attack specific proteins in food. When this happens, some of the physical
reactions include
 Hives
 Itching
 Swelling of the face, tongue, lips, eyelids, hands, and feet
 Rashes
 Headaches, migraines
 Nausea and/or vomiting
 Diarrhea, sometimes bloody
 Sneezing, coughing
 Asthma
 Breathing difficulties caused by tightening (swelling) of tissues in the
throat
 Loss of consciousness (from anaphylactic shock)
If you’re sensitive to a specific food, you may not have to eat the food to have
the reaction. For example, people sensitive to peanuts may break out in hives
just from touching a peanut or peanut butter and may suffer a potentially fatal
reaction after simply tasting chocolate that has touched factory machinery
that previously touched peanuts. People sensitive to seafood — fin fish and
shellfish — have been known to develop breathing problems after simply
inhaling the vapors or steam produced by cooking the fish.
Understanding how an allergic 
reaction occurs
When you eat a food containing a protein to which you’re sensitive, your
immune system releases antibodies that hitch a ride on white blood cells called
basophils. The basophils circulate through your entire body, giving the antibod-
ies the chance to hop off and bind to immune system cells called mast cells.
Basophils and mast cells produce, store, and release histamine, a natural
body chemical that causes the symptoms — itching, swelling, hives — associ-
ated with allergic reactions. Yes, that’s why some allergy pills are called anti-
histamines. When the antibodies carried by the basophils and mast cells
come in contact with food allergens, boom! You have an allergic reaction.
302
Part V: Food and Medicine 

Investigating two kinds 
of allergic reactions
Your body may react to an allergen in one of two ways — immediately or 
later on:
 Immediate reactions are more dangerous because they involve a fast
swelling of tissue, sometimes within seconds after contact with the
offending food.
 Delayed reactions, which may occur as long as 24 to 48 hours after
you’ve been exposed to the offending food, are usually much milder, per-
haps a slight cough or nasal congestion caused by swollen tissues.

Allergy lingo
So you think you have allergies. Now you need
to know about the lingo of allergies. These
words and definitions (an allergy glossary, if you
will) can help you understand what’s going on
with allergies:
allergen: Any substance that sets off an aller-
gic reaction (see “antigen” in this sidebar)
anaphylaxis: A potentially life-threatening aller-
gic reaction that involves many body systems,
creating a cascade of adverse effects begin-
ning with sudden, severe itching and moving on
to tissue swelling in the air passages that can
lead to breathing difficulties, falling blood pres-
sure, unconsciousness, and death
antibody: A protein in your blood that reacts to
an antigen by trying to render it harmless
antigen: A substance that stimulates a response
from the immune system; an allergen is a spe-
cific type of antigen
basophil: A white blood cell that carries IgE and
releases histamine
ELISA: Short for enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay, a test used to determine the presence of
antibodies in your blood, including antibodies to
specific allergens
histamine: The substance released by the
immune system (specifically by basophils and
mast cells) that produces the symptoms of an
allergic reaction such as itching and swelling
intolerance: A nonallergic adverse reaction to
food
IgE: An abbreviation for immunoglobulin E, the
antibody that reacts to allergens
mast cell: A cell in body tissue that releases 
histamine
RAST: An abbreviation for radioallergosorbent
test, a blood test used to determine whether
you’re allergic to certain foods
urticaria: The medical name for hives
American Academy of Allergy & Immunology,
International 
Food 
Information 
Council
Foundation, “Understanding Food Allergy”
(April 1995)

Most allergic reactions to food are unpleasant but essentially mild. However,
as many as 150 to 200 people die every year in the United States from a
severe reaction to a food allergy.
Call 911 immediately if you — or a friend or relative — show any signs of an
allergic reaction — including an allergic reaction to food — that affects
breathing.
It’s all in the family: Inheriting 
food allergies
A tendency toward allergies (although not the particular allergy itself) is
inherited. If one of your parents has a food allergy, your risk of having the
same problem is two times higher than if neither of your parents were allergic
to foods. If both your mother and your father have food allergies, your risk is
four times higher.
Considering Foods Most Likely 
to Cause Allergic Reactions
Here’s something to chew on: More than 90 percent of all allergic reactions to
foods are caused by just eight foods (see Figure 23-1):
 Milk
 Eggs
 Peanuts
 Tree nuts
 Soybean-based foods
 Wheat
 Fish
 Shellfish

Bill it (peanut-free), and they will come
In the real world, having a peanut allergy may
affect your ability to enjoy simple pleasures,
such as a baseball game where peanuts are
sold. So imagine the delight of parents in New
Britain, Connecticut, when the local Eastern
League team (the Rock Cats) decided to set
aside a special 138-seat food-free section
during its 2002 season for baseball-crazy but
peanut-allergic kids and their families at a game
between the Rock Cats and the New Haven
Ravens.
The Rock Cats and the Food Allergy &
Anaphylaxis Network, a national consumer
advocacy group with 250 members in the
Hartford area, cooked up the idea because, as
Rock Cats assistant general manager John Willi
has said, “No child should be deprived of the
Rock Cats experience.”
Other minor league teams, such as the North
Carolina Hickory Crawdads, the West Michigan
Whitecaps, and the St. Paul (Minnesota) Saints
have all had peanut-free sections for at least
one game during the 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and
2005 seasons.
But with the exception of the Texas Rangers,
who have experimented with a peanut-free sec-
tion at one game per season, the big leagues
are still striking out on this one. Write or e-mail
your local clubs to urge them to join the anti-
allergy team. Go. Now. Batter up!

Testing, Testing: Identifying 
Food Allergies
To identify the culprit causing your food allergy, your doctor may suggest an
elimination diet. This regimen removes from your diet foods known to cause
allergic reactions in many people. Then, one at a time, the foods are added back.
If you react to one, bingo! That’s a clue to what triggers your immune response.
To be absolutely certain, your doctor may challenge your immune system by
introducing foods in a form (maybe a capsule) that neither you nor he can
identify as a specific food. Doing so rules out any possibility that your reac-
tion has been triggered by emotional stimuli — that is, seeing, tasting, or
smelling the food.
Two more-sophisticated tests — ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
and RAST (radioallergosorbent test) — can identify antibodies to specific
allergens in your blood. But these two tests are rarely required.
Coping with Food Allergies
After you know that you’re allergic to a food, the best way to avoid an allergic
reaction is to avoid the food. Unfortunately, that task may be harder than it
sounds because the offending ingredient may be hidden — peanuts in the
chili or caviar (“fish eggs”) in the dip.
306
Part V: Food and Medicine 
Elimination diets
Because different people are sensitive to dif-
ferent foods, more than one elimination diet
exists. The three listed here eliminate broad
groups of foods known to cause allergic reac-
tions in many people. Your doctor will pick the
one that seems most useful for you.
Diet No. 1: No beef, pork, poultry, milk, rye,
or corn
Diet No. 2: No beef, lamb, rice, or milk
Diet No. 3: No lamb, poultry, rye, rice, corn,
or milk
The Merck Manual, 16th ed. (Rahway, N.J.:
Merck Research Laboratories, 1992)

Sometimes the “hidden” ingredient is hidden in plain sight on a food label
that uses chemical code names for allergens. Example? How about “whey” or
“casein” or “lactoglobulin” for “milk.” Happily, in the summer of 2004, Congress
passed and the President signed into law the Food Allergen Labeling and Con-
sumer Protection Act. As of January 1, 2006, all food labels must use plain
English words for the eight most-common food allergens. Goodbye “whey,”
“casein,” and “lactoglobulin.” Hello, milk. About time, I say.
If you’re someone with a potentially life-threatening allergy to food (or
another allergen, such as wasp venom), your doctor may suggest that you
carry a syringe prefilled with epinephrine, a drug that counteracts the reac-
tions. You may also want to wear a tag that identifies you as a person with a
serious allergic problem. One company that provides these tags is Medic-
Alert Foundation International, a 40+-year-old firm located in Turlock,
California. The 24/7 telephone number for Medic-Alert is 888-633-4298 (in the
U.S.) and 209-668-3333 (from outside the U.S.)
The food industry takes food allergies so seriously that the National Restaurant
Association has joined forces with the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma,
& Immunology; the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network; and the International
Food Information Council Foundation (IFIC) to produce a poster that shows
allergenic foods and gives directions on how to assist in an allergy emergency.
The poster is made to be hung in restaurant kitchens. For your very own $2.50
copy, go to the IFIC home page at www.ific.org, type “allergy poster” in the
Search box, click on Food Allergy Poster for Food Service Workers, and follow
the prompts.

Recognizing Other Body 
Reactions to Food
Allergic reactions aren’t the only way your body registers a protest against
certain foods.
307
Chapter 23: When Food Gives You Hives

Food intolerance is a term used to describe reactions that are common, nat-
ural, and definitely not allergic, which means that these reactions do not
involve production of antibodies by the immune system. Some common food
intolerance reactions are
 A metabolic food reaction: This response is an inability to digest cer-
tain foods, such as fat or lactose (the naturally occurring sugar in milk).
Metabolic food reactions can produce gas, diarrhea, or other signs of
gastric revolt and are an inherited trait.
 A physical reaction to a specific chemical: Your body may react to things
such as the laxative substance in prunes or monosodium glutamate (MSG),
the flavor enhancer commonly found in Asian food. Although some people
are more sensitive than others to these chemicals, their reaction is a physi-
cal one that doesn’t involve the immune system.
 A body response to psychological triggers: When you’re very fearful or
very anxious or very excited, your body moves into hyperdrive, secret-
ing hormones that pump up your heartbeat and respiration, speed the
passage of food through your gut, and cause you to empty your bowels
and bladder. The entire process, called the fight-or-flight response, pre-
pares your body to defend itself by either fighting or running. On a more
prosaic level, a strong reaction to your food may cause diarrhea. It isn’t
an allergy; it’s your hormones.
 A change in mood and/or behavior. Some foods, such as coffee, contain
chemicals, such as caffeine, that have a real effect on mood and behav-
ior, but that’s the subject of Chapter 24. Turn the page, and it’s yours.

raw the curtains. Turn down the lights. Come a little closer. We’re going
to talk about something nutritionists never seem to write about: Food
can make you feel good. And I don’t mean the simple warm good feelings that
follow a fine meal. I mean the pick-me-up-when-I’m-low, calm-me-down-when-
I’m-hyper kind of good you usually associate with serious mood-altering drugs.
Why do most nutrition books ignore this subject? Frankly, I haven’t a clue.
But the nice thing about writing this book is that it gives me the opportunity
to pass along a bunch of information that you may otherwise never see.
So here’s a chapter on mood and food. The chapter names some of the
common, naturally occurring, mood-alerting chemicals in food; explains how
these chemicals work; and presents some simple strategies for increasing
their effectiveness. Sit back, open a box of chocolates, pour a glass of wine,
brew up the espresso — and enjoy.
How Chemicals Alter Mood
A mood is a feeling, an internal emotional state that can affect how you see
the world. For example, if your team wins the World Series, your happiness
may last for days, making you feel so mellow that you simply shrug off minor
annoyances such as finding a ticket on your windshield because your parking
meter expired while you were having lunch. On the other hand, if you feel sad
because the project you spent six months setting up didn’t work out, your
disappointment can linger long enough to make your work seem temporarily
unrewarding or your favorite television show unfunny.

Most of the time, after shifting one way or the other, your mood swings back
to center fairly soon. You come down from your high or recover from your
disappointment, and life resumes its normal pace — some good stuff here,
some bad news there, but all in all, a relatively level field.
Occasionally, however, your mood may go haywire. Your happiness over your
team’s victory escalates to the point where you find yourself rushing from
store to store buying things you can’t afford, or your sadness over your fail-
ure at work deepens into a gloom that steals joy from everything else. This
unpleasant state of affairs — a mood out of control — is called a mood disorder.
About one in every four human beings (women more often than men) experi-
ences some form of mood disturbance during his or her lifetime. Eight or nine
out of every 100 people experience a clinical mood disorder, a mood disorder
serious enough to be diagnosed as a disease.
The two most common moods are happiness and sadness. The two most
common mood disorders are clinical depression, an elongated period of
overly intense sadness, and clinical mania, an elongated period of overly
intense elation. Clinical depression alone is called a unipolar (one-part) disor-
der; clinical depression plus clinical mania is a bipolar (two-part) disorder.
Today, scientists have identified naturally occurring brain chemicals that
affect mood and play a role in mood disorders. Your body makes a group of
substances called neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that enable brain
cells to send messages back and forth. Three important neurotransmitters are
 Dopamine (DOE-pa-meen)
 Norepinephrine (NOR-e-pe-NEF-rin)
 Serotonin (ser-a-TOE-nin)
Dopamine and norepinephrine are chemicals that make you feel alert and
energized. Serotonin is a chemical that can make you feel smooth and mellow.
Some forms of clinical depression and mania appear to be malfunctions of
the body’s ability to handle these chemicals. Drugs known as antidepressants
adjust mood by making neurotransmitters more available to your brain or
enabling your brain to use them more efficiently. Medications used to treat
mood disorders include
 Tricyclic antidepressants: These drugs are named for their chemical
structure: three ring–shaped groups of atoms (tri = three; cyclic = ring).
They relieve symptoms by increasing the availability of serotonin. One
well-known tricyclic is amitriptyline (Elavil).
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): These medicines slow
your body’s reabsorption of serotonin so that more of that chemical is
310
Part V: Food and Medicine 

available to your brain. SSRIs are reported to have fewer side effects
than the tricyclics. Two well-known SSRIs are fluoxetine (Prozac) and
paroxetine (Paxil).
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors): These drugs slow
your body’s natural destruction of dopamine and other neurotransmit-
ters so that they remain available for your brain. Phenelzine (Nardil) and
tranylcypromine (Parnate) are MAO inhibitors.
 Lithium: This drug’s precise actions remain unknown, but it may increase
the availability of serotonin and lower the availability of norepinephrine.
 A number of chemicals unrelated to each other or to other groups of
antidepressants: Some are known to regulate the availability of sero-
tonin; others work in ways that have not yet been identified. This group
includes bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban) and sertraline (Zoloft).
How Food Affects Mood
Good morning! Time to wake up, roll out of bed, and sleepwalk into the
kitchen for a cup of coffee.
Good afternoon! Time for a moderate glass of whiskey or wine to soothe away
the tensions of the day.
Good grief! Your lover has left. Time for chocolate, lots of chocolate, to
soothe the pain.
Good night! Time for milk and cookies to ease your way to Dreamland.
For centuries, millions of people have used these foods in these situations,
secure in the knowledge that each food will work its mood magic. Today,
modern science knows why. Having discovered that your emotions are linked
to your production or use of certain brain chemicals, nutrition scientists
have been able to identify the natural chemicals in food that change the way
you feel by
 Influencing the production of neurotransmitters
 Hooking onto brain cells and changing the way the cells behave
 Opening pathways to brain cells so that other mood-altering chemicals
can come on board
The following sections describe chemicals in food most commonly known to
affect mood.
311
Chapter 24: Food and Mood

Alcohol
Alcohol is the most widely used natural relaxant. Contrary to common belief,
alcohol is a depressant, not a mood elevator. If you feel loosey-goosey and
exuberant after one drink, the reason isn’t that the alcohol is speeding up
your brain; it’s that alcohol relaxes your controls, the brain signals that nor-
mally tell you not to put a lampshade on your head or take off your clothes in
public.
For more about alcohol’s effects on virtually every body organ and system,
turn to Chapter 9. Here in this chapter, it’s enough to say that many people
find that, taken with food and in moderation — defined as one drink a day for
a woman and two for a man — alcohol can comfortably change one’s mood
from tense to mellow.
Anandamide
Anandamide is a cannabinoid, a chemical that hooks up to the same brain
receptors that catch similar ingredients in marijuana smoke. Your brain pro-
duces some anandamide naturally, but you also get very small amounts of
the chemical from (what else?) chocolate. In addition, chocolate contains two
chemicals similar to anandamide that slow the breakdown of the anandamide
produced in your brain, thus intensifying its effects. Maybe that’s why eating
chocolate makes you feel very mildly mellow. Not mellow enough to get you
hauled off to the hoosegow (jail) or to bring in the Feds to confiscate your
candy; just enough to wipe away the tears of lost love. (Don’t worry; you’d
need to eat at least 25 pounds of chocolate at one time to get any marijuana-
like effect.)
Caffeine
I don’t think that I have to tell you that caffeine is a mild stimulant that
 Raises your blood pressure
 Speeds up your heartbeat
 Makes you burn calories faster
 Makes you urinate more frequently
 Causes your intestinal tract to move food more quickly through your body
Nor do I have to tell you that caffeine is a mood elevator. Although it increases
the level of serotonin, the calming neurotransmitter, it also hooks up at specific
312
Part V: Food and Medicine 

receptors (sites on the surface of brain cells) normally reserved for another nat-
urally occurring tranquilizer, adenosine (a-DEN-o-seen). When caffeine latches
on in place of adenosine, brain cells become more reactive to stimulants such
as noise and light, making you talk faster and think faster. Lately, athletes who
take coffee before an event have reported that it also improves performance in
some endurance events.
However, how people react to caffeine is a highly individual affair. Some can
drink seven cups of regular (“with caffeine”) coffee and still stay calm all day
and sleep like a baby at night. Others — me, for instance — tend to hop
about on decaf. Or as my husband often says, “What was the blur that just
went through the living room?” Perhaps those who stay calm have enough
brain receptors to accommodate both adenosine and caffeine, or perhaps
they’re more sensitive to the adenosine that manages to hook up to brain
cells. Nobody really knows.
Either way, caffeine’s bouncy effects may last anywhere from one to seven
hours. I know that I can count on missing a night’s sleep when I have real (as
opposed to decaffeinated) coffee after 5 p.m. Espresso at dinner? I’ll still be
awake when the birds get up the next morning. Table 24-1 lists some common
food sources of caffeine.

Tryptophan and glucose
Tryptophan is one of the amino acids, a group of chemicals commonly called
the building blocks of protein (see Chapter 6). Glucose, the end product of
carbohydrate metabolism, is the sugar that circulates in your blood, the
basic fuel on which your body runs (see Chapter 8). Milk and cookies, a clas-
sic calming combo, owe their power to the tryptophan/glucose team.
Start with the fact that neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and
serotonin are made from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, which are
found in protein foods (like milk). Tyrosine is the most important ingredient
in dopamine and norepinephrine, the alertness neurotransmitters. Tryptophan
is the most important ingredient in serotonin, the calming neurotransmitter.
All amino acids ride into your brain like little trains on tiny chemical railroads.
But Mother Nature — clearly a party animal! — has arranged the switches so
that your brain makes way for the bouncy tyrosine train first and the soothing
tryptophan train last. That’s why a high-protein meal heightens your alertness.
To move the tryptophan train up the track, you need glucose, and that means
you need carbohydrate foods (like those cookies). When you eat carbs, your
pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that enables you to metabolize the carbs
and produce glucose. The insulin also keeps tyrosine and other amino acids cir-
culating in your blood so that tryptophan trains can travel on plenty of open
tracks to the brain. With more tryptophan coming in, your brain can increase its
production of soothing serotonin. That’s why a meal of starchy pasta (starch is
composed of chains of glucose molecules, as explained in Chapter 8) makes you
calm, cool, and kind of groovy.
The effects of simple sugars such as sucrose (table sugar) are more compli-
cated. If you eat simple sugars on an empty stomach, the sugars are absorbed
rapidly, triggering an equally rapid increase in the secretion of insulin, a hor-
mone needed to digest carbohydrates. The result is a rapid decrease in the
314
Part V: Food and Medicine 

amount of sugar circulating in your blood, a condition known as hypoglycemia
(hypo = low; glycemia = sugar in the blood) that can make you feel temporar-
ily jumpy rather than calm. However, when eaten on a full stomach — dessert
after a full meal — simple sugars are absorbed more slowly and may exert the
calming effect usually linked to complex carbohydrates (starchy foods).
So some foods, such as meat, fish, and poultry, make you more alert. Others,
such as pasta, bread, potatoes, rice and other grains, calm you down. The
effect of the food depends on its ability to alter the amount of serotonin avail-
able to your brain. (See Figure 24-1.)
Phenylethylamine (PEA)
Phenylethylamine — sometimes abbreviated PEA — is a natural chemical
that your body releases when you’re in love, making you feel, well, good all
over. A big splash occurred in the late 1980s when researchers discovered
that chocolate, the food of lovers, is a fine source of PEA.
In fact, many people think that PEA has a lot to do with chocolate’s reputa-
tion as the food of love and consolation. Of course, to be fair about it, choco-
late also contains the mood-elevator caffeine, the muscle stimulant
theobromine, and the cannabinoid anandamide (see the discussion on anan-
damide earlier in this chapter).What is there to say other than, “Hey, can you
please pass that box of chocolates down to this end of the table?
Using Food to Manage Mood
No food will change your personality or alter the course of a mood disorder.
But some may add a little lift or a small moment of calm to your day, increase
your effectiveness at certain tasks, make you more alert, or give you a neat
little push over the finish line.

315
Chapter 24: Food and Mood

The watchword is balance:
 One cup of coffee in the a.m. is a pleasant push into alertness. Seven
cups of coffee a day can make your hands shake.
 One alcohol drink is generally a safe way to relax. Three may be a disaster.
 A grilled chicken breast (white meat, no skin) for breakfast — yes, 
breakfast — on a day when you have to be on your toes before lunch
can help make you sharp as a tack.
 Got an important lunch meeting? Order starches without fats or oils:
pasta with fresh tomatoes and basil, no oil, no cheese; rice with veggies;
rice with fruit. Your aim is to get the calming carbs without the high-fat
food that slows thinking and makes you feel sleepy.
In this, as in other aspects of a healthy life, the point is to make sure that you
use the tool (in this case, food), not the other way around.
316
Part V: Food and Medicine 
Caution! Medicine at work
Some of the mood-altering chemicals in food
interact with medicines. As you may have
guessed, the two most notable examples are
caffeine and alcohol.
 Caffeine makes painkillers such as aspirin
and acetaminophen more effective. On the
other hand, many over-the-counter (OTC)
painkillers and cold medicines already con-
tain caffeine. If you take the pill with a cup
of java, you may increase your caffeine
intake past the jitters stage.
 Alcohol is a no-no with most medicines
because it increases the sedative or
depressant effects of some drugs, such as
antihistamines and painkillers, and alters
the rate at which you absorb or excrete
others.
Always ask your pharmacist about food/drug
interactions (you can read more about this in
Chapter 25) when you fill a prescription. For OTC
products, read the label very carefully.

F
oods nourish your body. Medicines cure (or relieve) what ails you. You’d
think the two would work together in perfect harmony to protect your
body. Sometimes they do. Occasionally, however, foods and drugs square off
like boxers slugging it out in the ring. The drug keeps your body from absorb-
ing or using the nutrients in food, or the food (or nutrient) prevents you from
getting the benefits of certain medicines.
The medical phrase for this sad state of affairs is adverse interaction. This
chapter describes several adverse interactions and lays out some simple
strategies that enable you to short-circuit them.
How a Food and Drug 
Interaction Happens
When you eat, food moves from your mouth to your stomach to your small
intestine, where the nutrients that keep you strong and healthy are absorbed
into your bloodstream and distributed throughout your body. Take medicine
by mouth, and it follows pretty much the same path from your mouth to your
stomach, where it’s dissolved and passed along to the small intestine for
absorption. Nothing is unusual about that.
The problem, however, arises when a food or drug brings the process to a
screeching halt by behaving in a way that stops your body from using either
the drug or the food (see Figure 25-1). Many possibilities exist:
 Some drugs or foods change the natural acidity of your digestive tract
so that you absorb nutrients less efficiently. For example, your body

absorbs iron best when your stomach is acidic. Taking antacids reduces
stomach acidity — and iron absorption.
 Some drugs or foods change the rate at which food moves through your
digestive tract, which means that you absorb more (or less) of a particu-
lar nutrient or drug. For example, eating prunes (a laxative food) or taking
a laxative drug speeds things up so that foods (and drugs) move more
quickly through your body and you have less time to absorb medicine or
nutrients.
 Some drugs and nutrients bond (link up with each other) to form insolu-
ble compounds that your body can’t break apart. As a result, you get
less of the drug and less of the nutrient. The best-known example:
Calcium (in dairy foods) bonds to the antibiotic tetracycline so that
both zip right out of your body.
 Some drugs and nutrients have similar chemical structures. Taking them
at the same time fools your body into absorbing or using the nutrient
rather than the drug. One good example is warfarin (a drug that keeps
blood from clotting) and vitamin K (a nutrient that makes blood clot).
Eating lots of vitamin K-rich leafy greens counteracts the intended effect
of taking warfarin.
 Some foods contain chemicals that either lessen or intensify the natural
side effects of certain drugs. For example, the caffeine in coffee, tea, and
cola drinks reduces the sedative effects of antihistamines and some anti-
depressant drugs but increases the nervousness, insomnia, and shakiness
common with some diet pills and cold medications containing caffeine or
a decongestant (an ingredient that temporarily clears a stuffy nose).

Food Fights: Drugs versus 
Nutrients versus Drugs
Sometimes the combinations of interacting foods and drugs are positively
astounding. Or, as the next paragraph suggests, breathtaking.
Here’s a prime example. Everyone knows that people with asthma may find it
hard to take a deep breath around the barbecue. The culprit’s the smoke, right?
Yes. And no. True: Breathing in smoke irritates air passages. But the kicker is
that eating charcoal-broiled food speeds the body’s elimination of theophylline,
a widely used asthma drug, reducing the drug’s ability to protect against wheez-
ing. Take the drug, eat the food, and end up wheezing. Yipes.
Another potential troublemaker is fruit juice. Acidic beverages (colas as well
as fruit juice) can send the antibiotics erythromycin, ampicillin, and penicillin
down for the count.
Grapefruit juice is another acidic actor. In the mid-1990s, researchers tracking
the effects of alcohol beverages on the blood pressure drug felodipine (Plendil)
tripped across the Grapefruit Effect, a dramatic reduction in your ability to
metabolize and eliminate certain drugs. Grapefruit juice contains substances
that suppress the effectiveness of CYP 3A4, an intestinal enzyme required to
convert many drugs to water-soluble substances you can flush out of your
body; without the enzyme, you can’t get rid of the drug. The result may be an
equally dramatic rise in the amount of medication in your body, leading to
unpleasant side effects. The list of drugs that interact with grapefruit juice has
now expanded beyond felodipine to include a second blood pressure med,
nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), plus — among others — the cholesterol-lowering
drugs lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), and simvastatin (Zocor);
the antihistamine loratadine (Claritin); the immunosuppressant drug cyclo-
sporine; and saquinavir (Invirase), a protease (enzyme) inhibitor used to treat
HIV. By the way, if you feel particularly wired after drinking grapefruit juice with
your a.m. coffee or tea, maybe it’s because the juice also interacts with caf-
feine. Who knew?
Water pills, more properly known as diuretics, make you urinate more often
and more copiously, thus increasing your elimination of the mineral potas-
sium. To make up what you lose, experts suggest adding potatoes, bananas,
oranges, spinach, corn, and tomatoes to your diet. Consuming less sodium
(salt) while you’re using water pills makes the water pills more effective and
decreases your loss of potassium.
Oral contraceptives seem to reduce the ability to absorb B vitamins, including
folate. Taking lots of aspirin or other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs) such as ibuprofen can trigger a painless, slow but steady loss of small
amounts of blood from the lining of your stomach that may lead to iron-
deficiency anemia.
319
Chapter 25: Food and Drug Interactions

Persistent use of antacids made with aluminum compounds may lead to loss
of the bone-building mineral phosphorus, which binds to aluminum and rides
right out of the body. Laxatives increase the loss of minerals (calcium and
others) in feces.
The antiulcer drugs cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac) can make
you positively giddy. These drugs reduce stomach acidity, which means the
body absorbs alcohol more efficiently. According to experts at the Mayo
Clinic, taking ulcer medication with alcohol leads to twice the wallop, like
drinking one beer and feeling the effects of two.
The point, of course, is to read the label and definitely check with your
doctor or pharmacist for any potential food and drug interactions whenever
you take medication.
Finally, consider nutritional supplements. The vitamins and minerals in nutri-
tional supplements are simply food reduced to its basic nutrients, so interac-
tions between drugs and supplements aren’t a surprise. Table 25-1 lists some
common vitamin/mineral and drug interactions. (For more information on
supplements, see Chapter 5.)

Avoiding Adverse Food 
and Drug Interactions
When you pick up an over-the-counter drug or get a new prescription, read
the label. Let me repeat that: Read. The. Label. Warnings and interactions often
are right there on the package. If they’re not, ask your doctor or pharmacist
whether you need to avoid any specific foods while you’re taking the drug.
Go on, now — ask.

Using Food to Improve 
a Drug’s Performance
Not every food and drug interaction is an adverse one. Sometimes a drug
works better or is less likely to cause side effects when you take it on a full
stomach. For example, aspirin is less likely to upset your stomach if you take
the painkiller with food, and eating stimulates the release of stomach juices
that improve your ability to absorb griseofulvin, an antifungus drug.
Table 25-2 lists some drugs that may work better when your stomach is full.

Chapter 25: Food and Drug Interactions
With this medicine, who can eat?
Interactions aren’t the only drug reactions that
keep you from getting nutrients from food. Some
drugs have side effects that also reduce the
value of food. For example, a drug may
 Sharply reduce your appetite so that you
simply don’t eat much. The best-known
example may be the amphetamine and
amphetamine-like drugs such as fenflu-
ramine used (surprise!) as diet pills.
 Make food taste or smell bad or steal away
your senses of taste or smell so that eating
isn’t pleasurable. One example is the anti-
depressant drug amitriptyline (Elavil), which
can leave a peculiar taste in your mouth.
 Cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea so that
you either can’t eat or do not retain nutri-
ents from the food you do eat. Examples
include the antibiotic erythromycin and
many drugs used to treat cancer.
 Irritate the lining of your gut so that even if
you do eat, your body has a hard time absorb-
ing nutrients from food. One example of a
drug that causes this side effect is cyclo-
phosphamide, an antitumor medication.
The moderately good news is that new medica-
tions appear to make some drugs (including anti-
cancer drugs) less likely to cause nausea and
vomiting. The best news is that many drugs are
less likely to upset your stomach or irritate your
gut if you take them with food (see Table 25-2).
For example, taking aspirin and other nonpre-
scription painkillers such as ibuprofen with food
or a full glass of water may reduce their natural
tendency to irritate the lining of your stomach.

Using Food as Medicine
In This Chapter
 Discovering diets for special medical conditions
 Using food to ease annoying but relatively minor health problems
 Eating to prevent disease
 Serving up meds in food
 Knowing when food is not your best medicine
A
healthful diet gives you the nutrients you need to keep your body in
top-flight condition. In addition, evidence suggests that eating well may
prevent or minimize the risk of a long list of serious medical conditions,
including heart disease, high blood pressure, and cancer.
This chapter describes what nutritionists know right now about how to use
food to prevent, alleviate, or cure what ails you — with a couple of hints
about what’s to come in the evolving world of medical nutrition.
Defining Food as Medicine
Start with a definition. A food that acts like a medicine is one that increases
or reduces your risk of a specific medical condition or cures or alleviates the
effects of a medical condition. For example:
 Eating foods with lots of beta carotene (the natural chemical in deep
yellow and dark green fruits and veggies that your body converts to vita-
min A) — along with vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc — protects your
vision by reducing the risk of age-related degeneration of the macula,
the organ at the back of your eye that enables you to perceive light.
 Eating foods, such as wheat bran, that are high in insoluble dietary fiber
(the kind of fiber that doesn’t dissolve in your gut) moves food more
quickly through your intestinal tract and produces soft, bulky stool that
reduces your risk of constipation.

 Eating foods such as beans that are high in soluble dietary fiber (fiber
that dissolves in your intestinal tract) seems to help your body mop up
the cholesterol circulating in your bloodstream, preventing it from stick-
ing to the walls of your arteries. This reduces your risk of heart disease.
 Eating sufficient amounts of calcium-rich foods ensures the growth of
strong bones early in life and protects bone density later on.
 Eating very spicy foods, such as chili, makes the membrane lining your
nose and throat weep a watery fluid that makes blowing your nose or
coughing up mucus easier when you have a cold.
 Eating (or drinking) foods (or beverages) with mood-altering substances
such as caffeine, alcohol, and phenylethylamine (PEA) may lend a lift
when you’re feeling down or help you chill when you’re tense.
The joy of food-as-medicine is that it’s cheaper and much more pleasant than
managing illness with drugs. Given the choice, who wouldn’t opt to control
cholesterol levels with oats or chili (all those yummy beans packed with solu-
ble dietary fiber) than with a drug whose possible side effects include kidney
failure and liver damage?
Examining Diets with Absolutely,
Positively Beneficial 
Medical Effects
Some foods and some diet plans are so obviously good for your body that no
one questions their ability to keep you healthy or make you feel better when
you’re ill. For example, if you’ve ever had abdominal surgery, you know all
about liquid diets — the water-gelatin–clear broth regimen your doctor pre-
scribed right after the operation to enable you to take some nourishment by
mouth without upsetting your gut.
Or if you have type 1 diabetes (an inherited inability to produce the insulin
needed to process carbohydrates), you know that your ability to balance the
carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in your daily diet is important to stabilizing
your illness.
Other proven diet regimens include
 The low-cholesterol, low-saturated-fat diet: The basic version, known as
the Stage 1 Diet, is used as a first step in lowering a person’s cholesterol
level. The diet limits cholesterol consumption to no more than 300 mil-
ligrams a day and total fat intake to no more than 30 percent of your
total daily calories (see Chapter 16).
326
Part V: Food and Medicine 

A nifty bonus to this diet is that it’s a relatively painless way of losing
weight.
 The high-fiber diet: A high-fiber diet quickens the passage of food
through the digestive tract. This diet is used to prevent constipation. If
you have diverticula (outpouchings) in the wall of your colon, a high-
fiber diet may reduce the possibility of an infection. It can also alleviate
the discomfort of irritable bowel syndrome (sometimes called a nervous
stomach). Extra bonus: A diet high in soluble fiber also lowers choles-
terol (see the preceding section, “Defining Food as Medicine”).
 The sodium-restricted diet: Sodium is hydrophilic (hydro = water; philic =
loving). It increases the amount of water held in body tissues. A diet low in
salt often lowers water retention, which can be useful in treating high
blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and long-term liver disease.
By the way, not all the sodium in your diet comes from table salt. Check
out Chapter 16 for a list of the sodium compounds used in food.
 The extra-potassium diet: People use this diet to counteract the loss 
of potassium caused by diuretics (drugs that make you urinate more fre-
quently and more copiously, causing you to lose excess amounts of potas-
sium in urine). Some evidence also suggests that the high-potassium diet
may lower blood pressure a bit.
 The low-protein diet: This diet is prescribed for people with chronic
liver or kidney disease or an inherited inability to metabolize amino
acids, the building blocks of proteins. The low-protein regimen reduces
the amount of protein waste products in body tissues, thus reducing the
possibility of tissue damage.
Using Food to Prevent Disease
Using food as a general preventive is an intriguing subject. True, much anec-
dotal evidence (“I did this, and that happened”) suggests that eating some
foods and avoiding others can raise or lower your risk of some serious dis-
eases. But anecdotes aren’t science. The more important indicator is the evi-
dence from scientific studies tracking groups of people on different diets to
see how things such as eating or avoiding fat, fiber, meat, dairy foods, salt,
and other foods affect their risk of specific diseases.
Sometimes, the studies show a strange effect (meat fat increases the risk of
colon cancer, high-fat dairy foods lower the risk). Sometimes studies show no
effect at all. And sometimes — I like this category best — they turn up results
nobody expected. For example, in 1996, a study was designed to see whether
a diet high in selenium would reduce the risk of skin cancer. After four years,
the answer was “Not so you’d notice.” But then researchers noticed — by
accident — that people who ate lots of high-selenium foods had a lower risk
327
Chapter 26: Using Food as Medicine

of lung, breast, and prostate cancers. Naturally, researchers immediately set
up another study, which happily confirmed the unexpected results of the first.
Foods that serve up a health benefit in addition to basic good nutrition have
been christened “functional foods.” Fruits and veggies rich in vitamin A are
naturally functional foods that prevent night blindness (the inability to see
clearly in low light) along with their low-calorie, low-fat goodness. A second
kind of functional food is one created to produce a specific medical result,
such as a food that can actually deliver a vaccine (which you can read more
about later in this chapter).
Battling deficiency diseases
The simplest example of food’s ability to act as preventive medicine is its
ability to ward off a deficiency disease, a condition that occurs when you
don’t get sufficient amounts of a specific nutrient. For example, people
deprived of vitamin C develop scurvy, the vitamin C–deficiency disease. The
identifying characteristic of a deficiency disease is that simply adding the
missing nutrient to your diet can cure it; scurvy disappears when people eat
foods such as citrus fruits that are high in vitamin C.
Fighting off cancer with food
Is there really an anticancer diet? Right now, the answer seems to be a defi-
nite maybe. The problem is that cancer isn’t one disease; it’s many. Some
foods seem to protect against some specific cancers, but none seem to pro-
tect against all. For example:
 Fruits and vegetables: Plants contain some potential anticancer sub-
stances, such as antioxidants (chemicals that prevent molecular frag-
ments called free radicals from hooking up to form cancer-causing
compounds); hormone-like compounds that displace natural and syn-
thetic estrogens; and sulfur compounds that interfere with biochemical
reactions leading to the birth and growth of cancer cells. (For more
about these protective substances in plant foods, see Chapter 12.)
 Foods high in dietary fiber: Human beings can’t digest dietary fiber, but
friendly bacteria living in your gut can. Chomping away on the fiber, the
bacteria excrete fatty acids that appear to keep cells from turning can-
cerous. In addition, fiber helps speed food through your body, reducing
the formation of carcinogenic compounds.
For more than 30 years, doctors have assumed that eating lots of 
dietary fiber reduces the risk of colon cancer, but in 1999, data from the
long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s
Hospital and Harvard’s School of Public Health threw this into question.
By 2005, several very large studies — one with more than 350,000
328
Part V: Food and Medicine 

people! — confirmed that dietary fiber has no protective effect against
colon cancer. But even if dietary fiber doesn’t fight cancer, it does pre-
vent constipation. One out of two ain’t bad.
 Low-fat foods: Dietary fat appears to increase the proliferation of vari-
ous types of body cells, a situation that may lead to the out-of-control
reproduction of cells known as cancer. But all fats may not be equally
guilty. In several studies, fat from meat seems linked to an increased risk
of colon cancer, but fat from dairy foods comes up clean. In the end, the
link between dietary fat and cancer remains up in the nutritional air . . .
so to speak.
The American Cancer Society Advisory Committee on Diet, Nutrition, and
Cancer Prevention issued a set of nutrition guidelines that shows how to use
food to reduce the risk of cancer. These are the American Cancer Society’s
recommendations:
 Choose most of the foods you eat from plant sources. Eat five or more
servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Eat other foods from plant
sources, such as breads, cereals, grain products, rice, pasta, or beans,
several times a day.
 Limit your intake of high-fat foods, particularly from animal sources.
Choose foods low in fat; limit consumption of meats, especially high-fat
meats.
 Be physically active. Achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Be at least
moderately active for 30 minutes or more on most days of the week. Stay
within your healthy weight range.
 If you drink alcohol, drink in moderation. Chapter 9 lays it out:
Moderate consumption means no more than one drink a day for a
woman, two for a man.
CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, November/December 1996
DASHing to healthy blood pressure
More than 50 million Americans have high blood pressure (also referred to as
hypertension), a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and heart or
kidney failure.
As you can read in High Blood Pressure For Dummies (published by Wiley), the
traditional treatment for hypertension has included drugs (some with unpleas-
ant side effects), reduced sodium intake, weight reduction, alcohol only in mod-
eration, and regular exercise. Recent data from a National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI) study, “Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension” —
DASH, for short — offer strong evidence that the diet that protects your heart
and reduces your risk of some forms of cancer may also help control blood
pressure.
329
Chapter 26: Using Food as Medicine

The DASH diet is rich in fruits and vegetables, plus low-fat dairy products. No
surprise there. But the diet is lower in fat than the ordinary low-fat diet. The
USDA/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines for
Americans 2005 (see Chapter 16) recommend that you get no more than 35
percent of your total calories from fat. DASH says to aim for no more than 
27 percent.
The difference seems to make a difference. Your blood pressure is measured
in two numbers that look something like this: 130/80. The first number is
your systolic pressure, the force exerted against artery walls when your heart
beats and pushes blood out into your blood vessels. The second, lower
number is the diastolic pressure, the force exerted between beats.
When male and female volunteers with high blood pressure followed the
DASH diet during clinical trials at medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts;
Durham, North Carolina; Baltimore, Maryland; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
their systolic blood pressures dropped an average 11.4 points and their dias-
tolic pressures an average 5.5 points. And unlike medication, the diet pro-
duced no unpleasant side effects — except, of course, for that occasional
dream of chocolate ice cream with real whipped cream, pound cake . . . Oh
well, nothing’s perfect.
Conquering the common cold
This section is not about chicken soup. That issue has been settled, and Dr.
Mom was right. In the 1980s, Dr. Marvin Sackler of Mount Sinai Medical Center
in Miami, Florida, published the first serious study showing that cold suffer-
ers who got hot chicken soup felt better faster than those who got plain hot

Three degrees of vegetarianism
Vegetarianism isn’t one diet; it’s three, each one
distinguished by what’s allowed in addition to
fruits, grains and, yup, veggies.
 Variation #1 is a plant-based diet for people
who don’t eat meat but do eat fish and poul-
try or just fish. (Fairness dictates that I 
add that many strict vegetarians don’t con-
sider people who eat fish or poultry to be
vegetarians.)
 Variation #2 is a plant-based diet for people
who don’t eat meat, fish, or poultry but do
eat other animal products such as eggs and
dairy products. Vegetarians who follow this
regimen are called ovo-lacto vegetarians
(ovo = egg; lacto = milk).
 Variation #3 is a diet for people who eat
absolutely no foods of animal origin.
Vegetarians who eat only plant foods are
called vegans.

water, and dozens of studies since have said, man, he’s right. Nobody really
knows why it works, but who cares? It works.
So let’s move on to other foods that make you feel better when you have the
sniffles — for example, sweet foods. Scientists do know why sweeteners —
white sugar, brown sugar, honey, molasses — soothe a sore throat. All sugars
are demulcents, substances that coat and soothe the irritated mucous mem-
branes. Lemons aren’t sweet, and they have less vitamin C than orange juice,
but their popularity in the form of hot lemonade (tea with lemon and sugar)
and sour lemon drops is unmatched. Why? Because a lemon’s sharp flavor
cuts through to your taste buds and makes the sugary stuff more palatable. In
addition, the sour taste makes saliva flow, and that also soothes your throat.
Hot stuff — such as peppers, horseradish (freshly grated is definitely the
most potent), and onions — contain mustard oils that irritate the membranes
lining your nose and mouth and even make your eyes water. As a result, it’s
easier to blow your nose or cough up mucus.
331
Chapter 26: Using Food as Medicine
Food and sex: What do these 
foods have in common?
Oysters, celery, onions, asparagus, mushrooms,
truffles, chocolate, honey, caviar, bird’s nest
soup, and alcohol beverages. No, that’s not a
menu for the very, very picky. It’s a partial list of
foods long reputed to be aphrodisiacs, sub-
stances that rev up the libido and improve
sexual performance. Take a second look and
you’ll see why each is on the list.
Two (celery, asparagus) are shaped something
like a male sex organ. Three (oysters, mush-
rooms, and truffles) are said to arouse emotion
because they resemble parts of the female
anatomy. (Oysters are also high in zinc, the min-
eral that keeps the prostate gland healthy and
ensures a steady production of the male hor-
mone testosterone. A 3-ounce serving of Pacific
oysters gives you 9 milligrams of zinc, about 82
percent of the 11 milligrams a day recom-
mended for adult men.)
Caviar (fish eggs) and bird’s nest soup are 
symbols of fertility. Onions — and Spanish fly
(cantharides) — contain chemicals that produce
a mild burning sensation when eliminated in
urine; some people, masochists to be sure, may
confuse this with arousal. Honey is the quintes-
sential sweetener: The Bible’s Song of Solomon
compares it to the lips of the beloved. Alcohol
beverages relax the inhibitions (but overindul-
gence reduces sexual performance, especially
in men). As for chocolate, well, it’s 
a veritable lover’s cocktail, with stimulants 
(caffeine, theobromine), a marijuana-like com-
pound called anandamide, and phenylethy-
lamine, a chemical produced in the bodies of
people in love.
So do these foods actually make you feel sexy?
Yes and no. An aphrodisiac isn’t a food that
sends you in search of a lover as soon as you
eat it. No, it’s one that makes you feel so good
that you can follow through on your natural
instincts. Which is as fine a description as
you’re likely to get of oysters, celery, onions,
asparagus, mushrooms, truffles, chocolate,
honey, caviar, bird’s nest soup, and wine.

Finally, there’s coffee, a real boon to snifflers. When you’re sick, your body
piles up cytokines, chemicals that carry messages among immune system
cells that fight infection. When cytokines pile up in brain tissue, you get
sleepy, which may explain why you’re so drowsy when you have a cold. True,
rest can help to boost your immune system and fight off the cold, but once in
a while you have to get up. Like to go to work.
The caffeine in even a single cup of regular coffee (or one cup of decaf if, 
like me, you don’t ordinarily drink regular coffee) can make you more alert.
Caffeine is also a mood elevator (see Chapter 24) and a vasoconstrictor (a chem-
ical that helps shrink swollen, throbbing blood vessels in your head.) That’s
why it may help relieve a headache. When I have a cold, one cup of espresso
with tons of sugar can make life bearable. But nothing’s perfect: Drinking coffee
may intensify the side effects of OTC (over-the-counter) cold remedies contain-
ing decongestants and/or caffeine that make some people feel jittery.
Check the label warnings and directions before using coffee with your cold
medicine. Vasoconstrictors reduce the diameter of certain blood vessels and
may restrict proper circulation. Couldn’t hurt to check with your doctor, too,
if you’re taking meds for a chronic condition such as high blood pressure.
Eating for a Better Body (and Brain)
Citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C, an antioxidant vitamin that seems to slow
the development of cataracts. Bran cereals provide fiber that can rev up your
intestinal tract, countering the natural tendency of the contractions that
move food through your gut to slow a bit as you grow older (which is why
older people are more likely to be constipated). Getting enough calories to
maintain a healthy weight helps protect against wrinkles. And although a diet
with adequate amounts of fat doesn’t totally prevent dry skin, it does give
you a measure of protection. That’s one reason why virtually all sensible diet
gurus, including the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines,
recommend some fat or oil every day.
And now for a word about memory. Actually, two words: varied diet. A study
of 250 healthy adults, ages 60 to 94, at the University of New Mexico School 
of Medicine in 1983 showed that the people who ate a wide range of nutri-
tious foods performed best on memory and thinking tests. According to
researcher Philip J. Garry, Ph.D., professor of pathology at New Mexico School
of Medicine, overall good food habits seemed to be more important than any
one food or vitamin. Maybe people with good memory are just more likely to
remember that they need a good diet.
Or maybe it’s really the food. In 1997, another survey, this time at Complutense
University (Madrid, Spain), showed that men and women ages 60 to 90 who
332
Part V: Food and Medicine 

eat foods rich in vitamin E, vitamin C, folic acid, dietary fiber, and complex
carbohydrates do better on cognitive tests. Is it the antioxidant vitamins?
Does a low-fat diet protect the brain? No one knows for sure right now, but it
may turn out that sticking with this same-old, same-old low-fat, high-fiber diet
as you grow older may help you to remember to stick to the same-old low-fat,
high-fiber diet — for years and years and years.
Delivering Meds with Dinner
If an adventurous band of plant biologists have their way, the world’s chil-
dren — and their needle-phobic parents — will someday get their vaccine
inoculations with dinner rather than from a sharp stick in the arm.
Vaccines protect by introducing a substance called an antigen into your 
body. The antigen — a live or killed microbe particle — provokes an immune
response in which you make antibodies to fight the antigen. This reaction
inoculates you by teaching your body how to fight a specific infectious agent,
such as the flu virus. If you’re exposed later on, you’re ready to beat the bug.
Most modern vaccines are injected. Some, like the polio vaccine, may be
delivered on a sugar cube. Others can be inhaled. But for 15 years, Charles
Arntzen, founder of Arizona State University’s Biodesign Institute at Arizona
State University, and his fellows across the country have been working toward
creating “edible vaccines” — vaccines created via genetic engineering, by
inserting the antigen, a viral gene, into food.
Not just any food, mind you. Heat destroys vaccines, so to get the benefits,
you’d have to eat the food raw. To date, researchers have concentrated on
potatoes, tomatoes, and bananas, with the emphasis on the latter two
because — let’s face it — raw potatoes are no treat.
The primary target for the vaccines is diarrheal disease such as cholera and
E. coli, which kill more than 2.5 million children under the age of 5 every year.
Other possibilities include the Norwalk virus that’s played havoc with cruise
liner vacations, hepatitis B, and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
In trials with cows, mice, rabbits, and mink, antigen-containing tobacco
leaves, alfalfa, tomatoes, and lettuce leaves have been able to trigger immune
reactions to diseases as varied as anthrax and the common cold. In a handful
of FDA-approved human studies at the National Vaccine Testing Center, the
University of Maryland, and Roswell Park Cancer Centre in Buffalo, New York,
human volunteers who ate about 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of raw potatoes 
containing anti-diarrheal or hepatitis vaccines showed an immune response
similar to what you might expect from an injected vaccine.
333
Chapter 26: Using Food as Medicine

Most researchers expect edible vaccines for animals to show up before edible
vaccines for human beings. When the human versions do arrive, the plant sci-
entists say they’ll be cheap, administered without a needle and without a
doctor.
Just don’t expect to toss some seeds in the window box and grow your own.
For one thing, fresh food has a relatively short shelf life. You can’t stick your
vaccine-laden banana in the fridge and use it sometime in the next six months.
Second, unless the food is grown in controlled conditions, you can’t be sure it
has the correct amount of protective antigen. Finally, nobody wants these
genetically modified foods to somehow slip into the general food supply.
In the end, the plant guys say, the banana, tomato, potato, or other vaccine-
toting food will probably be sliced and diced, frozen, or ground to powder
and pressed into chips or tucked into a pill to make a stable med that can be
produced with basic agricultural and food-processing technologies available
virtually anywhere around the globe.
No needles, no doctors, no fuss. Now that’s a med any mother could love.
The Last Word on Food versus Medicine
Sometimes, a person with a life-threatening illness is frightened by the side
effects or the lack of certainty in standard medical treatment. In desperation,
he may turn down medicine and turn to diet therapy. Alas, doing this may be
hazardous to his already-compromised health.
No reputable doctor denies the benefits of a healthful diet for any patient at
any stage of any illness. Food not only sustains the body but also can lift the
spirit. But although food and diet may enhance the effects of many common
drugs, no one has found them to be an adequate, effective substitute for
(among other medicines)
 Antibiotics and other drugs used to fight infections
 Vaccines or immunizations used to prevent communicable diseases
 Anticancer drugs
If your doctor suggests altering your diet to make your treatment more effec-
tive, your brain will tell you, Hey, that makes sense. But if someone suggests
chucking your doctor and tossing away your medicine in favor of food ther-
apy alone, heed the natural warning in your head. You know there’s no free
lunch and — as yet — no truly magical food, either.

f you’ve ever read a For Dummies book, you know what
to expect here — nifty lists of useful factoids that make
great conversation starters and help you wind your way
through the subject at hand.
In this book, that means ten great Web sites, ten superstar
foods, and ten easy ways to cut the calories without elimi-
nating tasty food. What a bargain!

Ten Nutrition Web Sites
In This Chapter
 Finding FDA FAQs and facts online
 Educating yourself about side effects and food allergies
 Surfing the Web for accurate information about diet and health
 Finding links between diet and disease
T
he ten nutrition-oriented sites listed in this chapter give you reliable,
accurate, balanced information: nutritional guidelines, medical news,
interactive sites, directories, and more. And these sites are only a start. If
Wiley Publishing had called this part of the book The Part of Hundreds rather
than The Part of Tens, I could’ve included many more super sources, but
alas, I don’t have room for them here.
Nevertheless, here’s a sampling: the USDA National Agricultural Library at www.
nal.usda.gov, and the American Diabetes Association at www.diabetes.
org, and the Mayo Clinic at www.mayo.edu, and . . . well, you get the picture.

U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Nutrient Database
www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search
The USDA Nutrient Database is the ultimate food info chart, with nutrient
data for more than 5,000 foods in several serving sizes and different prepara-
tions. Each entry is a snapshot of a specific food serving (for example, a raw
apple with skin) that lists the amount of
 Water (by weight)
 Food energy (calories)
 Protein

 Total fat
 Carbohydrates
 Dietary fiber
 Minerals: Calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium,
and more
 Vitamins: Vitamin C, thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin,
vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin A, and more
 Lipids: Saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat, as well as
cholesterol
 Amino acids
 Other substances, such as caffeine, alcohol, and beta carotene
When you visit this site, the first page that comes up is headlined “Search the
USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference.” To find the food
you’re looking for, type its name — “apple,” for example — into the empty
box below, and then click on Submit. That brings up a list of possibilities,
such as “Babyfood, juice, apple and grape” or “Babyfood, dinner, apples and
chicken, strained.” Ignore the fancy stuff and scroll down to something basic,
such as “Apples, raw, with skin.” Click on the circle next to that entry and
click on Submit, and a new screen lists various forms of raw apple, such as
“100 grams” or “1 cup, quartered or chopped” or “1 large (3-1⁄4" dia) (approx 
2 per lb).” Choose the box in front of the serving you prefer, click on the
button marked Submit, and — bingo! There you are — calories and nutrients
for one large apple. Neat!
To access a list of foods showing the content of a single nutrient such as 
protein or calories or vitamin C or calcium or beta-carotene, click on the
button marked Nutrient Lists from the main page. Then follow directions to
get the list you want, with the foods arranged either in alphabetical order or
by the amount of the nutrient in the food. The lists are displayed as PDF
(portable document format) files; to read these files, you need Adobe Acrobat
Reader, a program available free at www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/
readermain.html.
USDA Food and Nutrition Information
Center (FNIC)
www.nal.usda.gov/fnic
Have you worked your way through every single one of the several thousand
listings on the USDA Nutrient Database in the previous section? Then come
on over to FNIC, which is part of the USDA National Agricultural Library.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

To access its info, slide your mouse over to the box on the left side of the
homepage and pick a subject. For me, the best are FNIC Resource Lists and
Food Composition.
The first offers, well, resource lists. The second provides pathways to such
nuggets of nutritional data as a report on “Isoflavone Content of Foods.”
(Don’t know what an isoflavone is? Stick a pencil in this page and turn back,
right now, to Chapter 12.) Yeah, some of the things pasted here may be much
more than you ever wanted to know about, well, the isoflavone content of
foods, but for the adventurous, this is a su-pah site. Take a flyer and try it.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
www.fda.gov
Entering the FDA Web site is like opening the door to the world’s biggest
nutritional-information toy store. So much stuff is on the (virtual) shelves
that you hardly know which item to grab first. Luckily, in this store, all the
toys are free, and plenty of links to other helpful information mean you can
linger here happily for days. Weeks. Years. Maybe forever.
FDA’s charter includes drugs as well as food, so on the left of the homepage,
you can click on links to information on medicines for people and pets, poi-
sons and side effects, medical devices (think pacemakers), and products that
give off radiation. The links under Let Us Hear from You, near the center of
the page, let activists report on adverse events (“I took that antibiotic and
got hives!”) or allow you to contact the FDA with your questions and com-
ments. For foodies (people who want to know ab-so-lute-ly everything about
different kinds of food and food preparation), though, the main event is, 
well, food.
On the FDA homepage, scroll down the left side and click on Food. Doing so
takes you to a page headed “Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition”
(CFSAN) (www.cfsan.fda.gov), which is more fun than a barrel of, oh,
M&M’s.
The main page of the food section is devoted to Recent News, Program Areas,
National Food Safety Programs, Special Interest Areas, and the ever popular
Other Sources of Information. On the left side of the page are links to FDA
Documents and sites, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses where you can
interact with CFSAN.
Only my editor’s insistence that we keep this book to fewer than 1,000 pages
prevents me from telling you what’s listed under each main headline and then
what’s listed under the subheads, and then . . . see? Try it. You’ll love it.

Chapter 27: Ten Nutrition Web Sites

American Dietetic Association
www.eatright.org
This site features nutrition recommendations, tips, guidelines, research,
policy, and stats from the world’s largest membership association of nutrition
professionals, primarily registered dietitians. (For a quick rundown on who’s
who in nutrition science, see Chapter 1.)
The ADA homepage features links to categories (such as Professional
Development) that are clearly meant to appeal to association members. But
the site also has tidbits for consumers, such as daily nutrition tips, a monthly
feature, nutrition position papers, and an online store where you can find,
yes, Dieting For Dummies (Wiley).
The niftiest feature on the homepage is the link to Find a Nutrition Professional.
Click on this link and you gain access to the ADA’s Nationwide Nutrition
Network, a referral service that links consumers, doctors, food companies,
and restaurant people with dietetic professionals. ADA’s mission is to serve
the public by promoting nutrition, health, and well-being. If you can bend
your brain around the much-too-adorable net address (“eatright”? Give me a
break!), you’ll discover this site is a true treasure trove. And golly gee, who
wouldn’t love having a personal dietitian to lead the way through the maze of
conflicting nutritional advice?
The American Heart Association
www.americanheart.org
This site tells you everything you ever wanted to know about diet and heart
disease. Starting at the homepage, run your mouse down the left side to
Healthy Lifestyle. Click on it — and then click on Diet & Nutrition. Up pops a
page with features such as the American Heart Association No-Fad Diet,
Delicious Decisions (heart healthy yummies), Nutrition Facts, Dietary
Recommendations, and Shopping Made Simple.
The indisputable link between diet and heart disease risk, not to mention the
AHA site’s user-friendly approach, makes this a must-stop on your nutritional
tour of the Web.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The American Cancer Society
www.cancer.org
The ACS Web site is dedicated primarily to information about cancer: defini-
tions, treatments, research, and support services. True, most of the nutrition
news you find here is available elsewhere, but this site’s defined focus pro-
vides easy access to other cancer-related topics.
On the ACS homepage, type “diet” into the Search box at top. Bingo! You’ve
opened a grab bag of ACS press releases, guidelines, and the most common
questions people ask about food and cancer (with answers). More-targeted
searches — such as “high-fiber food” — yield more-specific responses, such
as information on whether dietary fiber is related to a lower risk of colon
cancer.
Until now, the American Cancer Society was barely a blip on the screen of
nutrition sources. Today, with a growing number of well-designed studies to
demonstrate that some foods and diet regimens may reduce your risk of cer-
tain types of cancer while others put you in harm’s way, the ACS Web site
offers solid reporting on this area of nutritional research.
The Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network
www.foodallergy.org
The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) is a nonprofit member-
ship organization (membership fee: $30/year for individuals) whose partici-
pants include families, doctors, dietitians, nurses, support groups, and food
manufacturers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The group provides education
about food allergies in addition to support and coping strategies for people
who are allergic to specific foods.
From FAAN’s homepage, you can link to updates, daily tips, newsletter excerpts,
and all the usual service-oriented goodies. The site’s best feature — an e-mail
alert system — is free. Click the link under Special Allergy Alerts, fill out the
form, and submit it to the site. You’re now connected to an early warning
341
Chapter 27: Ten Nutrition Web Sites

system with allergy-linked news and information about recalls of troublesome
products, such as 2-ounce bags of cashews that may mistakenly contain
peanuts.
This no-nonsense, highly accessible site is required reading for people with
food allergies. Others, such as families and friends, can also benefit from its
solid information and support services.
International Food Information 
Council (IFIC)
ific.org
The International Food Information Council (IFIC), created in 1985, is a non-
profit organization dedicated to improving the relationship between the
nutrition community — scientists, food manufacturers, health professionals,
government officials — and the news media. Although the council’s member-
ship includes corporations that make and sell food products, IFIC plays no
role in marketing products or promoting its members. Its aim is to make sure
that consumers get accurate information about diet and health.
The IFIC homepage allows you to access features in English or Spanish. Con-
sumers can bypass the professional stuff and head for links under Nutrition
and Food Safety Information or click on the “Food Insight Newsletter” or the
terrific Glossary of Food-Related Terms.
The site also offers articles on basic nutrition topics, such as functional
foods, oral health, dietary fats and fat replacers, and additional resources.
The writing is accessible, the information impeccable.
IFIC is a trade group, so purists may complain about some IFIC positions, such
as its endorsement of some food additives, but the site’s intelligent approach
to complex and emotional issues allows you to make up your own mind.
American Council on Science and Health
(ACSH) and the Center for Science 
in the Public Interest (CSPI)
www.acsh.org
www.cspinet.org
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The American Council on Science and Health and the Center for Science in
the Public Interest are two nonprofit consumer-friendly organizations that
usually sit on opposite sides of any nutritional issue. ACSH is cool and calm;
CSPI is a hot-button advocate.
For example, CSPI believes many additives are hazardous to your health;
ACSH says some additives are useful in some foods for some people. This kind
of disagreement ensures that if you punch up the same search word or phrase
on both sites, you’ll find out about the pros and cons of an issue. Neat.
Both sites feature news releases, position papers, online membership enroll-
ment, order forms for publications, and links to other sites.
Which site you prefer is pretty much a matter of personality, but you can’t go
wrong with either one if you’re looking for highly reliable information about
nutrition issues and how food and diet affect your health.
Tufts University Nutrition Navigator
The Tufts University Nutrition Navigator is (or was) the mother of all nutrition
guides, a site that evaluated several hundred other Web sites on a 25-point
scale measuring content and reliability — for ratings ranging from Among the
Best (22–25 points) down to Not Recommended (below 12 points).
The site should be included in this list, but when I went to check it out for this
edition of Nutrition For Dummies, this message popped up: “Tufts University
Nutrition Navigator (navigator.tufts.edu) is not available at this time. We
thank all of you who have visited the site over the past seven years.”
Horrors! An e-mail and call to Tufts elicited the information that the
University is looking for funding and expects to have the Navigator back
online sooner or later. So keep clicking on the address. Sooner (or later) I
hope the Navigator returns to help you set a reliable course through the
gazillions of nutrition sites.

E
ver since Eve pulled that apple (really a pomegranate) off the tree of
knowledge in the Garden of Eden, people have been attributing special
powers to one food or another.
This chapter is by no means the complete A+ list. For example, I haven’t
included chicken soup, because what more can anyone say about this univer-
sal panacea? Ditto for garlic and onions, both now honored as probably heart-
healthy. Winnowing down the list was hard, but somebody had to do it! So
here are my nominations for the Top Ten (actually, the Top Twelve, but who’s
counting?), plus a bonus list of baddies assembled by Men’s Health magazine.
Alcohol
Alcohol beverages play such an important part in human culinary and nutri-
tion history that they have their very own chapter earlier in this book. Simply
listing alcohol’s natural properties tells you right off why ancient peoples
called it a “gift of the gods” or the “water of life.” It’s an effective antiseptic,
sedative, and analgesic.
Moderate alcohol consumption relaxes muscles and mood, expands blood
vessels to lower blood pressure temporarily, and appears to lower the risk 
of heart disease, either by reducing the stickiness of blood platelets (small
particles that can clump together to form a blood clot) or by relaxing blood

vessels (making them temporarily larger) or by increasing the amount of
HDLs (“good cholesterol”) in your blood. Although some forms of alcohol,
such as red wines, have gotten more press attention with regard to these
effects, the truth is that controlled studies show similar effects with all forms
of alcohol beverages — wine, beer, and spirits.
Common wisdom to the contrary, alcohol sometimes may also be beneficial
to the brain. Yes, drinking can make you fuzzy, which is why — really — you
should never drink and drive. However, recent studies from the Institute of
Preventive Medicine at Kommunehospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, and
Johns Hopkins University in Maryland hint that regular consumption of mod-
erate amounts of wine may keep minds sharp into older age. (Check it out in
Chapter 9.) Next time you lift a glass and say, “To your health,” consider your-
self right on the money.
Beans
Modern science says that beans lower cholesterol levels with gums and pectin,
soluble dietary fibers that mop up fats and prevent their being absorbed by
your body. Oats, which also are rich in gums, particularly a gum called beta
glucan, produce the same effect.
Beans are also valuable for people with diabetes. Because beans are digested
very slowly, eating them produces only a gradual increase in the level of sugar
circulating in your blood. As a result, metabolizing beans requires less insulin
than eating other types of high-carb foods such as pasta and potatoes. In one
well-known study at the University of Kentucky, a diet rich in beans made it
possible for people with Type 1 diabetes (their bodies produce virtually no
insulin) to reduce their daily insulin intake by nearly 40 percent. Patients with
Type 2 diabetes (their bodies produce some insulin) were able to reduce
insulin intake by 98 percent.
Just about the only drawback to a diet rich in beans is gas resulting from the
natural human inability to digest some dietary fiber and complex sugars such
as raffinose and stachyose, which sit in your gut as fodder for the resident
friendly bacteria that digest the carbs and then release carbon dioxide and
(ugh) methane, a smelly gas.
One way to reduce intestinal gas production is to reduce the complex sugar
content of the beans before you eat them. Here’s how: Bring a pot of water to
a boil. Turn off the heat. Add the beans. Let them soak for several hours. The
sugars leach out into the water, which means you can discard the sugars by
draining the beans and adding fresh water to cook in. If that doesn’t do the
job, try two heat-and-soak sessions before cooking.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Berries
“Cholesterol buster” is easy to say. “Pterostilbene” (ter-o-STILL-bean) is a
tongue twister. But USDA researchers at the Natural Products Utilization
Research Unit in Oxford, Mississippi, think they may be synonyms. Pterostil-
bene, an antioxidant found primarily in blueberries (as well as cranberries,
lingonberries, and huckleberries), appears to step up the activity of cells in
your liver that reduce the production of cholesterol and other artery-clogging
fats. In fact, the USDA people hint that pterostilbene could be extracted from
blueberries to make commercial anticholesterol meds with fewer side effects
than those currently on the market. Until human tests are run, nobody will
know how many blueberries you have to eat to lower your cholesterol, but
some nutrition studies suggest that ounce for ounce, blueberries have one of
the highest antioxidant contents in the whole wide vegetable and fruit world.
So enjoy.
Bison
Bison is back. The really big bovid ruminant (translation: an animal related to
a cow) is no longer an endangered species. In fact, according to the 2,500-
member National Bison Association, the current bison herd is up to a whop-
ping 350,000 animals to be shipped to your table as the other red meat —
translation: beef.
Ounce for ounce, bison has less fat, less sat fat, less cholesterol, fewer calo-
ries, and more protein than you-know-what. It’s pretty tasty, too, with a rich
meaty flavor that survives broiling and grilling but may, alas, turn dry when
roasted. Not to worry: Most Americans get their first taste of bison as the
broiled burger now popping up on coffee shop menus all across the country.
While you’re waiting to be served, take a gander at the widely distributed
four-color table tent, which lists relative amounts of nutrients in 3.5-ounce
(100-gram) servings of bison, beef, pork, and chicken. As you may expect, the
bison wins.
One more thing: Never say “buffalo” when you mean “bison.” The scientific
name for American bison is — no kidding — Bison bison. The word buffalo
comes from French explorers who called bison “boeuf” (meaning beef).
English changed that to “buff.” Common usage smoothed that out to “buffle”
and eventually “buffalo.” Actual buffalo are native to Asia and Africa.
347
Chapter 28: Ten (Well, Okay, Twelve) Superstar Foods

Breast Milk
Human breast milk is more nutritious than cow’s milk for human babies. It
has a higher percentage of easily digested, high-energy fats and carbohy-
drates. Its proteins stimulate an infant’s immune system, encouraging his or
her white blood cells to produce plenty infection-fighting antibodies, includ-
ing those that go after viruses linked to infant diarrhea, which accounts for 23
percent of all deaths among children younger than 5. And get this: In 2004, a
report in the British Medical Journal Lancet said that feeding a baby breast
milk rather than formula for the first month of life may lower the child’s cho-
lesterol levels later in life, reduce the child’s eventual risk of high blood pres-
sure, and keep a person slimmer as he or she grows older.
All in all, a pretty good way to start off in life, doncha think?
Chocolate
Westerners have been fools for chocolate ever since the Spanish conquista-
dors discovered it at Montezuma’s Mexican court. And why not? The cocoa
bean is a good source of energy, fiber, protein, carbohydrates, B vitamins,
and minerals (one ounce of dark sweet chocolate has 12 percent of the iron
and 33 percent of the magnesium a healthy woman needs each day).
Nutritionwise, the rap on chocolate is that cocoa butter (the fat in chocolate)
is 59 percent saturated fat, primarily stearic acid. But nobody seems to have
told stearic acid that it’s a villain. Unlike other saturated fats, stearic acid nei-
ther increases LDLs (“bad cholesterol”) nor lowers HDLs (“good choles-
terol”). In addition, stearic acid makes blood platelets less likely to clump
together into a blood clot, thus lowering you risk of heart attack or stroke.
And don’t forget the phytosterols, steroidlike compounds in plants that sop up
cholesterol in your gut and zip it out of your body before it reaches your
bloodstream. Phytosterols, the heart-healthy ingredients in Take Control and
Benecol margarines, are found in cocoa beans and chocolate, leading canny
researchers at the University of California-Berkeley Division of
Cardiovascular Medicine and the Department of Nutrition to investigate
whether drinking a cocoa beverage once a day or eating a chocolate chew
twice a day can lower cholesterol levels in postmenopausal women.
In addition, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences in January 2006 credits the cocoa compound (–)epicatechin (transla-
tion: minus epicatechin) with the ability to help blood vessels relax. And as we
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

all know, relaxing your blood vessels means lowering your blood pressure —
and your risk of heart attack.
Does all this mean chocolate is a bona fide health food? Not yet. But is choco-
late healthful as part of a balanced diet? You bet. Especially because it’s a
veritable happiness cocktail containing caffeine (a mood elevator and central
nervous system stimulant), theobromine (a muscle stimulant), phenylethy-
lamine (another mood elevator), and anandamide, a chemical that stimulates
the same areas of the brain that marijuana does. No, eating chocolate won’t get
you high. You’d have to consume 25 pounds or more at one sitting to get the
smallest marijuana-like effect. Nonetheless, I think chocolate was Montezuma’s
way of making up for his, ahem, “revenge.”
Coffee
For years, there was nothing but bad news about coffee. Pancreatic cancer.
Cystic breasts. High cholesterol. Heart disease. Stroke. Birth defects. Heartburn
and reflux. But the worm — okay, the coffee bean — has turned: Later studies
show no link at all between drinking coffee and an increased risk of any of
these conditions. True, coffee may upset your stomach and keep you up at
night, but as Heartburn & Reflux For Dummies (published by Wiley) explains,
for most people, these effects are almost always linked to excess consump-
tion. (How much is “excess”? The amount varies from person to person, but
when you hit your limit, you’ll definitely know. Trust me.)
In the end, the simple fact is that taken in moderation, regular coffee definitely
qualifies for anybody’s list of super foods. Its most active ingredient, caffeine,
elevates your mood and increases your ability to concentrate; may improve
your athletic performance; can help shrink the swollen, throbbing blood ves-
sels that make your head ache; and boosts the effect of painkillers, which is
why caffeine is often included in over-the-counter analgesic (pain-relieving)
products. Which is also why, time after time, the java really does the job.
Fish
Did your great-grandmother call fish “brain food”? If so, it was because fish is
rich in iodine, the mineral that allows your thyroid gland to churn out thyroid
hormones vital to your ability to think and move. Once upon a time, back in
great-granny’s day, people living far from the ocean (our best natural source
of iodine) were often sluggish, sometimes even mentally retarded, because
they were lacking iodine.
349
Chapter 28: Ten (Well, Okay, Twelve) Superstar Foods

But this condition became rare in the U.S. after the introduction of iodized
salt in the 1920s. Fish’s modern reputation for medical magic comes from its
ability to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, in large part, because 
of its omega-3 fatty acids. These unsaturated fats make blood less sticky, 
thus reducing the incidence of clots. They also knock down levels of bad 
cholesterol.
You want proof? Here’s proof: In 2002, data from the long-running Harvard
Health Professionals Study indicated that people who eat 3 to 5 ounces of fish
just once a month have a 40 percent lower risk of ischemic stroke, a stroke
caused by a blood clot in a cranial artery. The Harvard study did not include
women. But a report on women and stroke published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association in 2000 says women who eat about 4 ounces of
fish — think one small can of tuna — two to four times a week appear to cut
their risk of stroke by a similar 40 percent. And in 2005, the American Journal
of Preventive Medicine published several reports from the Harvard Center for
Risk Analysis project concluding that “any fish consumption confers substan-
tial relative risk reduction compared to no fish consumption, with the possi-
bility that additional consumption confers incremental benefits,” including a
“17% reduction in death from heart attack, with each additional serving per
week associated with a further reduction in this risk of 3.9%.”
Of course, there are catches to this catch. First, some fish are high in mer-
cury, a metal that can damage a developing fetus, but small amounts of fish,
say two 3-ounce servings a week, seem to be safe for everyone else. Second,
frequent servings of fish may increase the risk of a stroke caused by bleeding
in the brain. This situation is common among Native Alaskans who eat lots of
fish and have a higher than normal incidence of hemorrhagic, or bleeding,
strokes. The Harvard study found no significant link between fish consump-
tion and bleeding strokes, but the researchers say more studies are needed
to nail down the relationship or lack thereof.
While we’re waiting, pass the chips. Sat fat– and trans fat–free, of course.
Nuts
Pass up the pretzels. Skip the chips. At snack time, reach for the almonds.
Although nuts are technically a high-fat food, a series of studies including
several at California’s Loma Linda University say that adding moderate
amounts of nuts to a cholesterol-lowering diet or substituting nuts for other
high-fat foods such as meats may cut normal to moderately high levels of
total cholesterol and LDLs (“bad cholesterol”) as much as 12 percent.

These guys should know. A while back, they made headlines with a walnut
study in which volunteers were given one of two diets, both based on National
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommendations. People on Diet #1
got 20 percent of their calories from fats in oils and fatty foods such as meat.
Folks on Diet #2 got 20 percent of their calories from high-fat nuts instead of
meat, but both controlled-fat diets appeared to lower cholesterol levels.
The take-home message here is that although nuts are high in fat, their fats
are polyunsaturated and monounsaturated cholesterol busters (more about
them in Chapter 7). And let us not forget that nuts also provide other heart-
healthy nutrients such as arginine (an amino acid your body uses to make a
clot-blocking compound called nitric oxide), folate (a B vitamin that lowers
blood levels of homocysteine, a risk factor for heart disease), vitamin E, and
dietary fiber.
So feel free to go (sensibly) nuts for nuts. Crunch.
White Tea
Black and green? So 20th century. The hot new color in tea is white. The leaves
for all three teas come from one plant, Camellia sinensis. But those leaves
meant for black and green teas are rolled and fermented before drying, while
those destined for white teas — which actually brew up pale yellow-red —
aren’t. Nutritionwise, this small change makes a big difference.
Flavonoids are natural chemicals credited with tea’s ability to lower choles-
terol, reduce the risk of some kinds of cancer, and protect your teeth from
cavity-causing bacteria. Fresh tea leaves are rich in flavonoids called cate-
chins, but processing the leaves to make black and green teas releases
enzymes that enable individual catechins to hook up with others, forming
new flavor and coloring agents called polyphenols (poly = many) that give
flavor and color to black and green teas. Because white tea leaves are neither
rolled nor fermented, fewer of their catechins marry into polyphenols. Accord-
ing to researchers at the Linus Pauling Institute (LPI) at Oregon State Univer-
sity, the plain catechin content of white tea is three times that of green tea.
Black tea comes in a distant third.
Why should you care about this? Because all those catechins seem to be
good for living bodies. For example, when LPI researchers tested white tea’s
ability to inhibit cell mutations in bacteria and slow down cell changes lead-
ing to colon cancer in rats, the white tea beat green tea, the former health
champ. And when scientists at University Hospitals of Cleveland and Case
Western Reserve University applied creams containing white-tea extract to
351
Chapter 28: Ten (Well, Okay, Twelve) Superstar Foods

human skin (on volunteers) and exposed the volunteers to artificial sunlight,
the creamed skin developed fewer pre-cancerous changes. To be fair, green
tea preparations were also protective, but white tea has less caffeine than
either green or black tea, which makes it the perfect brew for a recovering
caffeine fiend. Sip.
Whole Grains
If you’re a man who plans to live forever, a team of nutrition scientists at
Harvard/Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston have three words for you:
whole grain cereal. When the investigators took a look at the health stats for
a one-year period in the lives of the 86,190 male doctors in the long-running
Physicians’ Health Study, they found 3,114 deaths among the study volun-
teers, including 1,381 deaths from heart attack and stroke. Then they looked
a little closer and discovered that eating habits count. Men who ate at least
one serving of whole grain cereal a day were 27 percent less likely to die than
were men who ate refined grain products. The whole-grain group was also as
much as 28 percent less likely to succumb to a heart attack, regardless of
how much they weighed, whether they smoked or drank alcohol or took vita-
mins pills or had a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
Nobody yet knows exactly why this should be so. But they do know that
whole grains are a treasure trove of dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and
other phytochemicals (plant compounds such as antioxidants) that protect
by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol while improving the body’s abil-
ity to process nutrients, particularly carbohydrates.
The question is, how much cereal must you eat to benefit? The studies say
more is better, but one serving a day is better than none at all. To find the
right cereal, haul out your magnifying glass or bifocals to check the Nutrition
Facts label. If whole grain is the first ingredient and there’s at least 2 grams
dietary fiber per serving, you’ve found breakfast. For those who absolutely,
positively hate cereal, try whole-grain bread. And, yes, whole grains are an
equal opportunity dish. Earlier studies suggest that women, too, may come
out ahead by adding whole grain to their daily diets.
Yogurt
Yogurt is milk with added friendly bacteria that digest milk sugar (lactose) to
produce lactic acid, a natural preservative that gives the flavor of yogurt its
pleasant bite. Yogurt is definitely magical for people who are lactase deficient
(meaning they don’t produce enough lactase to digest milk sugar so that they
get gassy whenever they drink milk).
352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

But there’s no evidence to show that yogurt is a longevity tonic, a claim
traced back to Ilya Ilyich Metchnikoff, a Russian Nobel Prize winner (1908;
Physiology/Medicine) who believed that people die prematurely entirely
because of the action of “putrefying bacteria” in the intestines. Searching for
a way to disarm the putrefiers, Metchnikoff ended up in Bulgaria, a place
where many people lived past 50 and a significant percentage made it into
their late 80s.
Historians may argue that the only way to live that long in Bulgaria was to
avoid Bulgarian politics, but Metchnikoff credited the organisms used to
make Bulgarian cultured milk. He was wrong. The bugs, christened L. bulgari-
cus, make nice yogurt but don’t take up residence in the human gut. This
hardly mattered to Metchnikoff, who died in Paris in 1916, at the relatively
young age of 71. His faith in yogurt, however, continues to cycle in and out of
fashion.

Chapter 28: Ten (Well, Okay, Twelve) Superstar Foods
Tracking the terrible ten
In 2003, while others whistled a happy tune
about good foods, the worrywarts at Men’s
Health magazine compiled a list of the ten foods
most likely to make you feel absolutely awful —
mostly due to their tendency to harbor organ-
isms that can seriously upset your intestinal
tract. The top troublemakers are undercooked
chicken, ground beef, ground turkey, oysters,
and eggs, followed by unheated cold cuts, raw
scallions, peaches, cantaloupe, and packaged
salad greens. Luckily, thorough cooking (or
reheating) can make the first seven safe to eat.
As for peaches, the guys say, peel ’em to elimi-
nate pesticides stuck in the fuzz. Scrub your
bumpy cantaloupe before slicing to dislodge
bacteria in the rind that may otherwise be trans-
ferred to the fruit. And rinse your packaged
salad greens. Then rinse again. Even if the
packaged says “washed.” Splash.

Chapter 29
Ten Easy Ways to Cut Calories
In This Chapter
 Knowing the value of low-fat foods
 Cutting down, not cutting out
 Making substitutions that work
 Noting a special tip for chopped meat
L
osing weight is simple math. If you cut 3,500 calories out of your diet in
the course of a week without reducing your daily activity, you can say
goodbye to one whole pound of fat.
Yes, I know reading that sentence is easier than actually doing it, so I’m ready
to give you two tricks to make the job easier. First, cut your calories in small
increments — 50 here, 100 there — rather than in one big lump. Second,
instead of giving up foods you really love (and feeling deprived), switch to
low-fat versions.
This chapter tells you how to accomplish both. I’ve included some brand-
name products just so that you can compare different versions made by the
same companies.
Switching to Low-Fat or 
No-Fat Dairy Products
Milk and milk products are the best source for the calcium that keeps bones
strong. But these same products may also be high in cholesterol, saturated
fat, and calories. You can reduce all three by choosing a low- or no-fat milk
product.
For example, a cup of whole milk has 150 calories, but a cup of skim milk has
only 85. One slice of regular Kraft American cheese has 60 calories, but one

slice of Kraft Free American cheese has only 30. A sandwich made with three
slices of cheese is 90 calories lighter if the cheese is “free.”
Substituting Sugar Substitutes
Coffee has no calories, but every teaspoon of sugar you stir into your cup has
15 big ones. Multiply that by four (1 teaspoon each in four cups of coffee),
and your naturally no-cal beverage can add 60 calories a day to your diet.
Sixty calories a day times seven days a week, and yipes, that’s 420 calories!
That’s about as much as you’d get from four or five medium slices of unbut-
tered toast or five medium apples. So is this a good time to mention that one
packet of sugar substitute has absolutely zero calories? I thought so.
Serving Stew Instead of Steak
No matter how you slice it, red meat is red meat — cholesterol, saturated
fats, and all. But if you stew your beef or lamb or pork rather than broiling or
roasting it, you can skim off a bunch of high-calorie fat. Just make the stew
and then stick it in the fridge for a couple of hours until a layer of fat hardens
on top. Spoon it off: Every tablespoon of pure fat subtracts 100 calories from
dinner. And, yes, you can also cut off all visible fat before preparing the meat.
Same 100 calories per tablespoon of fat.
Choosing Low-Fat Desserts
Who says you have to suffer to cut calories? Not me. One half cup of Häagen-
Dazs chocolate ice cream has 270 calories. One half cup of Häagen-Dazs no-
fat chocolate sorbet has 140 calories. Believe me: Switching from the first to
the second is no problem. If you’re a true chocoholic, you’ll send me valen-
tines for this suggestion.
Peeling the Poultry
Most of the fat in poultry is in the skin. A fried chicken breast with skin has
217 calories; without the skin, it has only 160. Half a roasted duck (with skin)
has a whopping 1,287 calories; without skin, it’s only 444. Even if you have a
fried chicken breast every night for a week (which you would never, ever do),
you can save 399 calories by taking the skin off before cooking the bird. Share
seven skinless half-ducks with a friend, and you each save 2,950 calories a
week by removing the skin. Wow. That’s practically a pound right there.
356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Not Oiling the Salad
True, salad can be a low-fat, low-calorie meal. Throw in some breast of chicken
and a couple of no-fat croutons or cheese cubes, and it’s still mostly crunch.
But the dressing can do you in. For example, two tablespoons of Wishbone
Italian Dressing or one tablespoon of Hellmann’s regular “real mayonnaise”
have 100 calories. What to do? Ah, c’mon, you know the answer: Switch.
Two tablespoons of Wishbone Fat Free Italian dressing add just 15 — count
’em, 15! — calories. One tablespoon of Hellmann’s Light cuts the calorie
count in half, to 50 calories. Have salad once a day for a week, and you can
save 595 calories with fat-free rather than regular salad dressing or save 525
calories with low-fat mayonnaise rather than regular. Or as University of
Maine nutrition guru Alfred Bushway suggests, “Using a tablespoon of bal-
samic vinegar instead is even better.” Neat.
Don’t oil your pots and pans, either. Bake with parchment paper instead of
greasing the pan. Sauté with natural juices in nonstick pans. Every tablespoon
of fat you don’t use means approximately 100 fewer calories in the dish.
Making One-Slice Sandwiches
Depending on the brand, one slice of bread in your daily luncheon sandwich
may have anywhere from 65 to 120 calories. Eliminating one slice and serving
your sandwich open-faced can cut up to 840 calories from your weekly total.
And you know that making that one slice whole wheat adds dietary fiber to
your menu, right? Just asking.
Eliminating the High-Fat Ingredient
A bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich usually comes with three strips of
bacon, each one worth 100 calories. Leave off one strip and save 100 calories.
Leave off two, save 200 calories. Leave off three, save 300 calories — and
enjoy your lettuce and tomato sandwich with low-fat mayonnaise.
Here are some other ways to eliminate fat calories:
 Making spaghetti sauce without olive oil (100 calories a tablespoon)
 Making split pea soup without ham (55 to 90 calories an ounce)
 Making cream sauces with skim milk instead of cream (470 calories per
cup for the cream; 85 to 90 calories for the skim milk)
357
Chapter 29: Ten Easy Ways to Cut Calories

Seasoning the Veggies instead 
of Drowning Them in Butter
This one’s a no-brainer. Season your vegetables with herbs instead of greas-
ing them, and you save 100 calories for every unused tablespoon of butter,
margarine, or oil. Think dill on the potatoes, chives on the corn, oregano on
the green beans — whatever catches your imagination.
Washing the Chopped Meat
Yes, you read that right. Heat a teapot of water. Put the chopped meat in a
pan and cook it until it browns. Pour off the fat, turn the meat into a strainer,
and pour a cup of hot water over it. Repeat two times. Every tablespoon of fat
that melts or drains from the meat saves you 100 calories, plus cholesterol
and saturated fat. Use the defatted meat in spaghetti sauce. (Check out Figure
29-1 for the visual presentation!)
