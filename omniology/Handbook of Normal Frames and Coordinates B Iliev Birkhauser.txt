The book is divided into chapters which have a sequential Roman
enumeration. The chapters are divided into sections with a sequential Arabic enu-
meration, which is independent in each chapter. Some sections are divided into
subsections.
In each chapter the subsections, equations, propositions, theorems, lemmas,
and so on have a double independent enumeration of the form m.n or (m.n) for
the equations, m,n=1,2,. . . where m is the number of the section in which the
designated item appears and n is its sequential number in it. So, Proposition 4.7
and (3.12) (or equation (3.12)) mean respectively Proposition 7 in Section 4 and
equation 12 in Section 3 of the current chapter. A suitable item from a chapter
diÔ¨Äerent from the current one is referred as R.m, or R.m.n or (R.m.n) for equations,
where R=I,II,. . . is the Roman number of the chapter in which the item appears;
e.g., Remark II.5.3 and IV.4 (or Section IV.4) mean respectively Remark 3 in
Section 5 of Chapter II and Section 4 in Chapter IV.
The footnotes are indicated as superscripts in the main text and have inde-
pendent Arabic enumeration in each section. When we refer to a footnote, it is on
the current page if the page on which it appears is not explicitly indicated.
Citations.
An Arabic number in square brackets, e.g., [27], directs the reader
to the list of references, i.e., in this example [27] means the 27th item from the
Bibliography list beginning on page 401.
The ends of the proofs
are marked by empty square sign, viz. with ‚ñ°.
Indices.
The Latin indices refer to an arbitrary linear (vector) space, in particular
to the tangent and cotangent spaces. If in a given problem are presented the
tangent and cotangent spaces to a manifold and other vector space(s), then the
indices referring to the Ô¨Årst two spaces are denoted with small Greek letters; for
the rest one(s) the Latin letters will be used.

Einstein‚Äôs summation convention:
in a product of quantities or in a single ex-
pression, a summation over indices repeated on diÔ¨Äerent levels is assumed over
the whole range in which they change. Any exception of this rule is explicitly
stated.
Symmetrization and antisymmetrization.
On indices included in (or surrounded
by) round (resp. square) brackets a symmetrization (resp. antisymmetrization)
with coeÔ¨Écient one over the factorial of their number is assumed. If some indices
in such a group have to be excluded from this operation, they are included in
(surrounded by) vertical bars.
Matrix of linear mapping
with respect to a given basis, or bases, or Ô¨Åeld of, pos-
sibly local, bases: the same symbol but the kernel letter is in boldface. Exception:
the matrix of a derivation (derivative operator) is denoted by boldface capital
Greek letter gamma, i.e., by Œì, possibly with some indices.
Matrix elements.
When the elements of a (two-dimensional) matrix are labeled
by superscript and subscript, the superscript is considered as a Ô¨Årst index, number-
ing the matrix‚Äôs rows, and the subscript as a second one, numbering the matrix‚Äôs
columns. In this way the matrix of composition of linear mappings is equal to the
product of the matrices of the mappings in the same order in which they appear
in the composition and this does not depend on the way the matrix‚Äôs indices are
situated.
Free arguments.
If we want to show explicitly the argument(s) of some mapping
or to single out it (them) as arbitrary while the other arguments, if any, are
considered as Ô¨Åxed ones, we denote it (them) by (centered) dot, i.e., by ¬∑. E.g., if
f : A ‚ÜíC and g: A √ó B ‚ÜíC, then f( ¬∑ ) ‚â°f, g( ¬∑ , ¬∑ ) ‚â°g, and g( ¬∑ , b), b ‚ààB,
means g( ¬∑ , b): A ‚ÜíC with g( ¬∑ , b): a ‚Üíg(a, b) for all a ‚ààA.

Preface
The main subject of this book is an up-to-date and in-depth survey of the theory
of normal frames and coordinates in diÔ¨Äerential geometry. The existing results, as
well as new ones obtained lately by the author, on the theme are presented.
The text is so organized that it can serve equally well as a reference manual,
introduction to and review of the current research on the topic. Correspondingly,
the possible audience ranges from graduate and post-graduate students to scien-
tists working in diÔ¨Äerential geometry and theoretical/mathematical physics. This
is reÔ¨Çected in the bibliography which consists mainly of standard (text)books and
journal articles.
The present monograph is the Ô¨Årst attempt for collecting the known facts
concerting normal frames and coordinates into a single publication. For that rea-
son, the considerations and most of the proofs are given in details.
Conventionally local coordinates or frames, which can be holonomic or not,
are called normal if in them the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection vanish on some
subset, usually a submanifold, of a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. Until recently the exis-
tence of normal frames was known (proved) only for symmetric linear connections
on submanifolds of a manifold. Now the problems concerning normal frames for
derivations of the tensor algebra over a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold are well investigate;
in particular they completely cover the exploration of normal frames for arbitrary
linear connections on a manifold. These rigorous results are important in connec-
tion with some physical applications. They may be applied for rigorous analysis
of the equivalence principle. This results in two general conclusions: the (strong)
equivalence principle (in its ‚Äòconventional‚Äô formulations) is a provable theorem and
the normal frames are the mathematical realization of the physical concept of ‚Äòin-
ertial‚Äô frames. The normal frames Ô¨Ånd other important physical application in the
bundle formulation of quantum mechanics. It turns out that in a normal frame
the bundle Heisenberg and Schr¬®odinger pictures of motion coincide.
Applying some freedom of language, we can state the general physical idea:
the normal frames are the most suitable ones for describing free objects and events,
i.e., such that on them do not act any forces. Regardless of the diÔ¨Äerent realizations
of that idea in general relativity and its generalizations, quantum mechanics, gauge
theories etc., there is an underlying mathematical background for the general

Preface
description of such situations: the existence (or non-existence) of normal frames
in vector bundles. This observation Ô¨Åxes to a great extend the mathematical tools
required for the description of some fundamental physical theories.
In the book, formally, may be distinguished three parts: The Ô¨Årst one includes
Chapters I‚ÄìIII and deals with a variety of mathematical problems concerning nor-
mal frames and coordinates on diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds. The second part consists
of Chapters IV and V and investigates normal frames (and possibly coordinates)
in vector bundles and diÔ¨Äerentiable bundles, respectively. The last part, involving
the text after Chapter V, contains inquiry material.
The requisite mathematical language required for the description of nor-
mal frames is spread over the initial sections of the chapters. In particular, Sec-
tions I.2‚Äì I.4, III.2, IV.9, IV.2, IV.14.1 and V.2‚ÄìV.5 can be collected into an intro-
ductory chapter under the title ‚ÄúMathematical preliminaries‚Äù1 but this is not done
by pedagogical reasons.2 The normal coordinates and frames, in the case of linear
connections on a manifold, are initially introduced in Chapter I. It contains our
basic preliminary material and a review of the Riemannian coordinates. Chapter II
is devoted to the existence, uniqueness, construction and other related problems
concerning normal frames and coordinates in manifolds endowed with linear con-
nection. It presents, in historical order, a detailed review of the existing literature
as well as generalization of a number of results, e.g., for connections with torsion.
Further, in Chapter III, problems connected with the existence, uniqueness, holo-
nomicity etc. of normal frames for arbitrary derivations of the tensor algebra over
a manifold are investigated. Next (Chapter IV), the same range of problems is
explored for normal frames for linear transports in vector bundles. This material
covers completely the special case of normal frames for linear connections in vec-
tor bundles or on a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. The main aim of Chapter V is the
exploration of normal frames (and coordinates, if any) for general connections on
diÔ¨Äerentiable Ô¨Åbre bundles which, in particular, can be vector ones.
The general approach of the book is essentially coordinate-dependent or
basis-dependent. This is due to its basic subject: frames, bases or coordinates
with some special properties. However, if possible and suitable, the coordinate-
free notation and methods are not neglected.
The basic mathematical prerequisites vary from chapter to chapter but gener-
ically they include the grounds of vector (linear) spaces, diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds,
vector bundles, connection theory, and a Ô¨Årm belief in the existence and uniqueness
theorems of ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equations. Some of the corresponding concepts
and results are reproduced in our text but the acquaintance with adequate lit-
erature is required. Appropriate references are given in the Introductions to the
chapters and directly in the main text.
1As (practically) any ‚Äòpreliminary‚Äô knowledge requires for its understanding some other ‚Äòpre-
liminary‚Äô to it knowledge, in the corresponding sections are cited a number of works containing
this second kind of mathematical ‚Äòluggage‚Äô.
2The material is so organized, that the required concepts and results appear in the logical
order in which they are necessary for some particular purpose(s).

Introduction
The goal of this chapter is twofold: it introduces most of the basic preliminary
deÔ¨Ånitions and results on which our investigation rests (Sections 2, 3, and 4) and
it begins the study of the normal frames and coordinates (Sections 5 and 6).
The main concepts of diÔ¨Äerential geometry required for the understanding of
the book are: diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds and mappings, submanifolds, Riemannian
manifolds, tangent vectors and vector Ô¨Åelds, tensors and tensor Ô¨Åelds, linear con-
nections. The readers acquainted with them may only look over the corresponding
sections for our notation, omitting the major text to which they may wish to
return later, following the references to it.
In more details, the contents of the chapter is as follows.
The purpose of Section 2 is to Ô¨Åx our terminology and notation concern-
ing diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds and some typical to them natural structures. This
is not a summary of the diÔ¨Äerential geometry, only certain basic concepts and
particular relations between them required for our future aims are presented. At
Ô¨Årst the concepts of topological and diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds are introduced, then
tangent vectors, cotangent vectors, and tensors and the corresponding Ô¨Åelds of
them on a manifold are deÔ¨Åned. Also some expressions in local bases (or frames)
and coordinates are given. If the reader is acquainted with all this, he/she can
simply look over this Section for our notation skipping the main text. A reader
interested in deeper understanding of these concepts, as well as in diÔ¨Äerential
geometry as a whole, should consult with the specialized literature. Here is a
(random) selection of such titles. An elementary introduction to diÔ¨Äerential ge-
ometry, with ‚Äòphysical‚Äô orientation, can be found in [1‚Äì6]. The same purpose can
serve the books [7‚Äì10] which are more ‚Äòmathematically‚Äô oriented. Our text fol-
lows the excellent (text)books [11,12]. At last, the advanced works [13‚Äì16] can be
recommended. A brief synopsis of the mathematics preceding the introduction of
manifolds is given it [9,14,16] while [12,17] contain an expanded presentation of
the ‚Äòpreliminary‚Äô to manifolds material. Of course, the reading of all of the above-
mentioned serious books is not necessary for the understanding of what follows.
For this end, the reading of Section 2 is suÔ¨Écient and the references cited may be
consulted for more detains and proofs of some assertions. The knowledge of the
tensor analysis in coordinate-dependent language is desirable [18,19]. It is almost
suÔ¨Écient for the most of this and subsequent chapters.
In Section 3, we introduce the concept of linear connection on a manifold.
The approach chosen is, in a sense, middle between elementary books on general
relativity, such as [20, 21], and pure mathematical ones on diÔ¨Äerential geometry,
like [11,22]. We have tried to follow closely [9,11,12] but the abstracting material
is adapted to the goals of the present book. After a motivation for what the
connections are needed for, we introduce the linear connections via a system of
axioms for the covariant derivative of the algebra of tensor Ô¨Åelds over a given
manifold. We employ this method since the theory of vector bundles, which is not

1. Introduction

required for Chapters I‚ÄìIII, will be involve into action only at the beginning of
Chapter IV. In this connection, let us mention that the linear connections can be
deÔ¨Åned only on the algebra of vector Ô¨Åelds on a manifold (i.e., to the tangent to it
bundle), and then they admit a unique extension on the whole algebra of tensor
Ô¨Åelds [11, Chapter 3, Proposition 7.5]. A more advanced and deep treatment of
the theory of linear connections on manifolds and vector bundles can be found
in [10,13,15,22,23]. We also present the notion of a parallel transport (induced by
a linear connection) which will practically step on scene in Chapter IV but here is
a natural place for it to appear. It will be used in Chapters I‚ÄìIII for proving and
formulating some results. Section 3 ends with a brief consideration of the geodesics
and exponential mapping.
The concept of Riemannian metric and Riemannian connection are given in
Section 4. If the reader is interested in essence of Riemannian geometry, he/she is
referred, for example, to [8‚Äì12,19,24‚Äì27].
In Section 5, we introduce the main objects of our investigation, the normal
frames and coordinates. We deÔ¨Åne them as ones in which the coeÔ¨Écients of a
linear connection vanish on a given set. Some considerations on the uniqueness
and (an)holonomicity of the normal frames are presented too.
Section 6 contains a complete description of normal frames at a given point
on (C‚àû) Riemannian manifolds. This is done on the base of Riemannian coordi-
nates which turn to be normal at their origin. The geodesic coordinates are pointed
as other example of coordinates normal at a point. Some general results, proved
further in Chapter II, concerning the existence of normal frames on submanifolds
are quoted. An expanded presentation of the problem of existence of normal co-
ordinates at a point of a C‚àûRiemannian manifold is given in [19,24], where also
a list of original early works on this topic can be found.
In Section 7 are presented a number of examples and exercises of concrete
Riemannian connection and coordinates/frames normal for them on diÔ¨Äerent sets.
At Ô¨Årst, the (locally) Euclidean and one-dimensional manifolds are considered.
The (pseudo)spherical coordinates on (pseudo)spheres are (partially) investigated
for sets on which they are normal for the Riemannian connection induced on
them by the metric on them generated by the Euclidean one of the Euclidean
space in which the (pseudo)spheres are embedded. Similar instance on the two-
dimensional torus is presented. The cosmological models of Einstein, de Sitter
and Schwarzschild are considered (in concrete coordinates) from the view-point
of normal frames/coordinates on them. Some peculiarities of the light cone in
Minkowski spacetime are pointed too.
Section 8 deals with certain terminological problems concerning bases and
frames. Some links between these concepts are explicitly formulated and/or de-
rived.
The chapter ends with some general remarks and conclusions in Section 9.

DiÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds
In this section we introduce the basic concepts of diÔ¨Äerential geometry on which the
present and next chapters rest. First of all, attention is paid on the diÔ¨Äerentiable
manifolds and the algebras of tensors and tensor Ô¨Åelds on them.
2.1.
Basic deÔ¨Ånitions
As we shall see a little further, the Ô¨Åelds of real, R, and complex, C, numbers are
the simplest examples of respectively real and complex (one-dimensional) diÔ¨Äeren-
tiable manifolds. Correspondingly, their nth-Cartesian powers (direct products),



n-times
,
Cn := C √ó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ó C



n-times
where n ‚ààN, N := {1, 2, . . .} being the set of integers,1 and √ó is the Cartesian
product sign (of sets),2 are the simplest examples of respectively real and complex
n-dimensional manifolds.
The silent and, perhaps the most important idea in the concept of an n-
dimensional manifold M over a Ô¨Åeld K is that it is a set which is ‚Äòlocally Euclidean‚Äô
or which ‚Äòlocally looks like Kn‚Äô where, to save writing, K denotes some of the Ô¨Åelds
R or C. The intuitive meaning of the last phrase is that M can be divided into (or,
rewording, can be presented as a union of) sets each of which is into a bijective
(one-to-one onto) correspondence with some subset of Kn, in particular, possibly,
with the whole Kn.
Now, following the books [11,12], the precise deÔ¨Ånitions are in order.
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1. An n-dimensional topological K-manifold is a HausdorÔ¨Ätopological
space such that every its point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open
subset of Kn.3
Notice, if we say that U is a neighborhood of a set V ‚äÜM, M being a
topological space, we mean that U is an open set in M containing V . Otherwise
by a neighborhood (in M) we understand any open set in M (which set is a
neighborhood of any its point in the just pointed sense).
For K = R (resp. K = C) the manifold is called real (resp. complex). If K is
clear from the context, the n-dimensional K-manifold is referred as an n-manifold.
In this work only the Ô¨Ånite-dimensional case will be considered, i.e., n ‚ààN, with
1When writing x ‚ààX, X being a set, we mean ‚Äúfor all x in X‚Äù if the point x is not speciÔ¨Åed
(Ô¨Åxed, given) and is considered as an argument or a variable.
2For some purposes the sign ‚äïis used instead of √ó; the result is called a direct sum or product
in this case.
3For more general purposes, the HausdorÔ¨Äness can be dropped and/or K can be (locally)
replaced with an arbitrary dimensional vector space(s) [14, pp. 21‚Äì22], [10, pp. 2‚Äì4]. Some au-
thors [13, p. 32] add the additional requirement for existence of a countable base. These cases
will not be considered in the present book.

2. DiÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds

n < ‚àû. If both n and K are evident from the context, we speak simply of a
topological manifold.
The number n ‚ààN of an n-dimensional K-manifold M is called its dimension
and is denoted by dim M. If K = R (resp. K = C), the dimension of M is also
denoted by dimR (resp. dimC). (See p. 7 for the meaning of the symbol dimR M
for a complex manifold M.)
A chart of (for) a topological K-manifold M is an ordered pair (U, œï) of an
open subset U ‚äÜM, where ‚äÜis the contained in or equal sign, domain of the
chart, and homeomorphism œï: U ‚ÜíV onto an open subset V ‚äÜKn. Since any
open set V ‚äÜKn is homeomorphic to the whole Kn, we can always put V = Kn.
By DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1, for every point p ‚ààM there exists a chart in whose domain it
is contained. This is the rigorous expression of the phrases that ‚ÄòM locally looks
like (a neighborhood of) Kn‚Äô or ‚ÄòM is locally Euclidean‚Äô.
Example 2.1. The set Kn is an n-manifold and (Kn, idKn) is a (global) chart for
it. Here and henceforthidA denotes the identity mapping of a set A.
Let {ri : i = 1, . . . , n} be the standard Cartesian coordinate functions on
Kn, viz. if c = (c1, . . . , cn) ‚ààKn = K √ó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ó K (n-times), then ri(c) := ci is
the ith Cartesian coordinate of c. If (U, œï) is a chart of M, then {œï1, . . . , œïn},
œïi := ri ‚ó¶œï: U ‚ÜíK, ‚ó¶being the sign of mapping‚Äôs composition, is called local
coordinate system on U (with respect to the chart (U, œï)) and we say that U is
(local) coordinate neighborhood; the functions œïi are called coordinate functions.
As {ri} are Ô¨Åxed, sometimes œï is also called (local) coordinate system [10, p. 2].
The reason is that if we deÔ¨Åne the n-tuple (œï1, . . . , œïn) as a mapping U ‚ÜíKn by
(œï1, . . . , œïn)(p) := (œï1(p), . . . , œïn(p)), p ‚ààU then œï ‚â°(œï1, . . . , œïn).
The numbers œï1(p) = r1(œï(p)), . . . , œïn(p) = rn(œï(p)) ‚ààK (or the ordered
n-tuple (œï1(p), . . . , œïn(p))) are (is) called local coordinates of p ‚ààU with respect
to (U, œï). Often œïi(p) is abbreviated to pi.
If for two charts (U, œï) and (U ‚Ä≤, œï‚Ä≤) is fulÔ¨Ålled U ‚à©U ‚Ä≤ Ã∏= ‚àÖ, ‚àÖbeing the
empty set and ‚à©denotes intersections of sets, in U ‚à©U ‚Ä≤ are deÔ¨Åned two coordinate
systems, {œïi = ri‚ó¶œï} and {œï‚Ä≤ i = ri‚ó¶œï‚Ä≤}. Obviously, the connection between them
is œï‚Ä≤ i = (ri ‚ó¶œï‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶œï‚àí1) ‚ó¶œï which implies œï‚Ä≤ i(p) = (ri ‚ó¶œï‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶œï‚àí1)

œï1(p), . . . , œïn(p)

for p ‚ààU ‚à©U ‚Ä≤. So, we can write p‚Ä≤ i = p‚Ä≤ i(p1, . . . , pn), the explicit dependence
being just given.
A family {(UŒ±, œïŒ±)|Œ± ‚ààA} of charts on M is called an atlas if {UŒ±} is an
open cover of M, M = 
Œ±‚ààA UŒ±. Here the sign ‚à™mean union of sets. We speak
of an atlas of class (of smoothness) Ck, k ‚ààN ‚à™{0}, or of a Ck atlas if the
homeomorphisms œïŒ± are Ck compatible in a sense that if UŒ± ‚à©UŒ≤ Ã∏= ‚àÖfor some
Œ±, Œ≤ ‚ààA, then the mappings œïŒ≤ ‚ó¶œï‚àí1
Œ± : œïŒ±(UŒ± ‚à©UŒ≤) ‚ÜíœïŒ≤(UŒ± ‚à©UŒ≤) are of class
Ck as mappings, which actually are bijections, between open subsets of Kn. A Ck
mapping between open subsets of Kn is a one having continuous partial derivatives
for all orders r ‚â§k, k ‚àà{0} ‚à™N ‚à™{œâ}; C0 means continuous, Cœâ stands for (real
or complex) analytic, and if k ‚ààN is arbitrary we speak of C‚àûmappings. The

values k = 3, 2, 1 will be suÔ¨Écient for the most problems to be considered in this
book.
Obviously, any topological manifold M admits atlases. A chart (U, œï) of M
is said to be (Ck) compatible with an atlas {(UŒ±, œïŒ±)|Œ± ‚ààA} if œïŒ± ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 : œï(UŒ± ‚à©
U) ‚ÜíœïŒ±(UŒ± ‚à©U) is a Ck mapping for every Œ± such that UŒ± ‚à©U Ã∏= ‚àÖ. Two atlases
are (Ck) compatible if each chart of one of them is (Ck) compatible with the
other atlas. The compatibility relation between atlases is an equivalence relation.
An equivalence class of atlases on M is called a Ck diÔ¨Äerentiable structure (on M).
A diÔ¨Äerentiable structure on M can also be deÔ¨Åned as the maximal (complete)
atlas Ck compatible with (and containing) a given atlas {(UŒ±, œïŒ±)|Œ± ‚ààA}. So,
any atlas, when expanded to a complete atlas, gives rise to a Ck structure.
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.2. A diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold of class Ck is a topological manifold with
Ô¨Åxed Ck diÔ¨Äerentiable structure on it.
Remark 2.1. To be quite precise, the object described in DeÔ¨Ånition 2.2 is called
diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold without boundary of class Ck [14, p. 38]. There are a number
of equivalent or similar deÔ¨Ånitions of a manifold with boundary (see, e.g., [14,
Chapter II, ¬ß 4], [16, p. 139], [12, pp. 208‚Äì209]), one of them being the following.
Let Œª: Kn ‚ÜíR be continuous linear mapping into R. A Euclidean (‚Äòupper‚Äô) half
space or plane H+
Œª is the closed subset of Kn given by the non-negative values of
Œª, H+
Œª := {h|h ‚ààKn, Œª(h) ‚â•0}. For instance, in the real case, K = R, one usually
takes Œª = rn, Œª(c1, . . . , cn) = cn for ci ‚ààR, which results in H+
Œª = Rn
+ := {c|c ‚àà
Rn, rn(c) ‚â•0}, or Œª: c ‚Üín
1 aici for a Ô¨Åxed non-zero a ‚ààRn. A chart (with
boundary) in a K-topological manifold M is a pair (U, œï) of an open subset U ‚äÜM
and homeomorphism œï: U ‚ÜíV from U on an open subset V of H+
Œª . There are
charts (U, œï) for which œï(U) is open set in H+
Œª homeomorphic to Kn and others
for which œï(U) is open set in H+
Œª but not in Kn. If we make this modiÔ¨Åcation in
all of the above text, i.e., take a chart with boundary for a chart, we obtain the
notions of atlas and diÔ¨Äerentiable structure with boundary and correspondingly a
manifold with boundary. An example of such a manifold, which is frequently met,
is a real interval J
closed from one of both ends with (J, idJ) as a diÔ¨Äerentiable
structure. The manifolds without boundary are evident special case of the ones
with boundary. Most of the results concerning manifolds without boundary can
be transferred on manifolds with boundary; general directions on how this can be
done are given in [14, pp. 38‚Äì40]. In a general context, a manifold should mean
manifold with boundary. However, in this book we shall deal exclusively with
manifolds without boundary which, for brevity, will be called simply manifolds.
Often a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold of class Ck is denoted as Ck-manifold. So, a
B-manifold with B = n, K, Ck means diÔ¨Äerent things depending on the context.
In this book only Ck-manifolds will be employed; they will, for brevity, be referred
simply as manifolds, the class of smoothness, usually C3, or C2, or C1, will be
clear from the context.

2. DiÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds

Example 2.2. The sets Rn and Cn are C‚àûmanifold with (Rn, idRn) and (Cn, idCn),
respectively, as C‚àûdiÔ¨Äerentiable structures.
It is well known [10,11,26], every n-dimensional complex manifold has also a
structure of 2n-dimensional real manifold and, consequently, can be considered as
real manifold of dimension 2n. Since the complex and real diÔ¨Äerentiable structures
on a complex manifold are in bijective correspondence, both points of view, the
real and complex ones, on it are equivalent. The dimension of a complex manifold
M considered as a real manifold is denoted by dimR M. Hence, we have dimR M =
dim M if M is real and dimR M = 2 dim M = 2 dimC M if M is complex.
A subset N of m-dimensional manifold M is called an n-dimensional sub-
manifold of M, n ‚â§m, if for every point p ‚ààN there exists a chart (U, œï) of M
with p in its domain, U ‚àãp, and such that
œï: N ‚à©U ‚ÜíKn √ó {a},
œï: q ‚Üí(œï1(q), . . . , œïn(q), a1, . . . , am‚àín)
for some Ô¨Åxed a = (a1, . . . , am‚àín) ‚ààKm‚àín and all q ‚ààN ‚à©U. The set of charts
{( ¬ØU, ¬Øœï)}, given by ¬ØU := U ‚à©N and ¬Øœï: ¬ØU ‚ÜíKn with ¬Øœï(q) := (œï1(q), . . . , œïn(q)),
is an atlas on N of the same class as the original atlas {(U, œï)} on M. So, in more
precise terms, a subset N ‚äÜM with just described diÔ¨Äerentiable stricture is an
n-dimensional submanifold of the m-manifold M, m ‚â•n.4 One should be aware
of the fact that presently subtle versions of diÔ¨Äerent deÔ¨Ånitions of a ‚Äòsubmanifold‚Äô
are in current use.
Example 2.3. The open subsets of a manifold M (which will be referred as neigh-
borhoods) and the sets consisting of Ô¨Ånite number of its points are respectively
dim M- and zero-dimensional submanifolds of M.
Important examples of submanifolds are generated according to the theorem
in [12, p. 228].
2.2.
DiÔ¨Äerentiable mappings
Let M and N be Ck-manifolds of dimension m and n, respectively, and a mapping
f : M ‚ÜíN be given. If (U, œï) and (V, œà) are charts in the respective complete
atlases on M and N such that f(U) ‚äÜV , the mapping ¬Øf := œà ‚ó¶f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 from
œï(U) ‚äÜKm into œà(V ) ‚äÜKn (locally) represents f in them.
A mapping f is diÔ¨Äerentiable of class Cr, r ‚â§k at p ‚ààM if œà ‚ó¶f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1
is a Cr mapping at œï(p). Such mappings are also called Cr diÔ¨Äerentiable or Cr
mappings (at p).5 Obviously, the Cr diÔ¨Äerentiability at a point is independent of
the particular charts utilized above. If r1, . . . , rm and v1, . . . , vn are the standard
4If N already has a manifold structure, we suppose it to be equivalent to the described sub-
manifold one. Otherwise one should clearly specify with respect to which diÔ¨Äerentiable structure
N is considered as a manifold.
5For manifolds with boundary (see Remark 2.1) the following modiÔ¨Åcations must be done [16,
p. 139]. If O is an open subset of H+
Œª , the mapping g : O ‚ÜíH+
¬µ , with Œª, ¬µ: Kn ‚ÜíR being C0

Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
coordinate functions on Km and Kn respectively, in the local coordinate systems
{œïi := ri‚ó¶œï, i = 1, . . . , m} and {œàj := vj‚ó¶œà, j = 1, . . . , n} the Cr diÔ¨Äerentiability
means that the set of n functions
f j := œàj ‚ó¶f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 = vj ‚ó¶œà ‚ó¶f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 : œï(U) ‚ÜíK
are of class Cr at the point œï(p) = (p1, . . . , pm) ‚ààKm, pi := œïi(p). Sometimes
this is expressed by the assertion that the set of functions ¬Øqj = f j(q1, . . . , qm),
j = 1, . . . , n, qi ‚ààK, called expression of f in coordinates, are of class Cr at
qi = pi.
The mapping f : M ‚ÜíN is of class Cr, r ‚â§k (is a Cr mapping, is Cr
diÔ¨Äerentiable) if it is Cr diÔ¨Äerentiable at every point p ‚ààM. Analogously, f is a
Cr mapping on M ‚Ä≤ ‚äÇM if it is a Cr at every point p ‚ààM ‚Ä≤.
The above deÔ¨Ånitions are mutatis mutandis transferred on mappings like
f : M ‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíN ‚Ä≤ with M ‚Ä≤ ‚äÇM and N ‚Ä≤ ‚äÇN: at the corresponding places U and V
have to be replace by U ‚à©M ‚Ä≤ and V ‚à©N ‚Ä≤ respectively.
Under a diÔ¨Äerentiable mapping or simply mapping between Ck manifolds, we
shall understand a Ck mapping between them, i.e., a Cr mapping with maximal
r, r = k.
Example 2.4. A mapping f : M ‚ÜíKm is called function on M. If it is of class Cr
(at p ‚ààM), it is called a Cr function (at p ‚ààM). It is real or complex depending
on K = R, C. If (U, œï) is a chart of M and we take (Km, idKm) as a natural atlas
of Km, then f has the local representation ¬Øf = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 : œï(U) ‚ÜíKm. The algebra
of Cr, r ‚â§k (resp. all) functions on (one and the same neighborhood of) a subset
U ‚äÜM of a Ck manifold with k ‚â•0 will be denoted by Fr(U) (resp. by F(U)).
In particular, Fr(p), p ‚ààM and Fr(M) are the algebras of Cr functions on a
(Ô¨Åxed) neighborhood of p and on the whole M respectively. Let us note that the

A mapping f : M ‚ÜíN between Ck manifolds is called Cr, r ‚â§k, diÔ¨Äeo-
morphism if it is bijective and f and f ‚àí1 are of class Cr. A Ck diÔ¨Äeomorphism is
referred as simply diÔ¨Äeomorphism. With respect to the manifolds, the diÔ¨Äeomor-
phisms play the same role as the isomorphisms (resp. homeomorphisms) in the
theory of vector (resp. topological) spaces.

2.3.
Tangent vectors and vector Ô¨Åelds
A number of diÔ¨Äerent but equivalent deÔ¨Ånitions of a tangent vector can be found
in the literature [7,11‚Äì13]. Below we reproduce the most direct one.
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.3. A tangent vector on a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold M of class Ck, with
k ‚â•1, at a point p ‚ààM is a linear mapping Xp : F1(p) ‚ÜíK satisfying the Leibnitz
rule:
Xp(af + bg) = aXp(f) + bXp(g),
a, b ‚ààK
f, g ‚ààF1(p)
(2.1)
Xp(fg) = g(p)Xp(f) + f(p)Xp(g),
f, g ‚ààF1(p).
(2.2)
Thus a tangent vector at p is a derivation of the algebra F1(p).6
Example 2.5. A mapping Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, J being R-interval of arbitrary type (open
or closed from one or the both ends), is called path (or parameterized curve).7 If
Œ≥ is a C1 path, the mapping ÀôŒ≥(s): F1(Œ≥(s)) ‚ÜíK given by

ÀôŒ≥(s)

(f) := df(Œ≥(t))
dt
			
t=s,
s, t ‚ààJ
f ‚ààF1(Œ≥(s)),
(2.3)
where ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ |A means the restriction of ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ to the set A, is an important example of
a tangent vector at p = Œ≥(s) ‚ààŒ≥(J).8 So, ÀôŒ≥(s)(f) is the derivative of f along Œ≥
at the parameter value s. The vector ÀôŒ≥(s) is called tangent to Œ≥ at Œ≥(s) or, more
precisely, at the parameter value s as it may happen that, for a non-injective path,
there are s, t ‚ààJ such that s Ã∏= t, Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t) and ÀôŒ≥(s) Ã∏= ÀôŒ≥(t). Sometimes ÀôŒ≥(s)
is denoted by
d
ds which can be confusing. As a result of (2.3), the vector ÀôŒ≥(s) is
often denoted by
d
dt
		
t=sŒ≥(t).
The set of all tangent vectors at p ‚ààM is a linear space (over K = R, C)
called tangent (vector) space to M at p. It is denoted by Tp(M) or, for brevity,
by Mp or Tp if there is no risk of ambiguity. The dimensions of Tp(M) and M
coincide for every p, dim Tp(M) ‚â°dim M. Moreover, if (U, œï) is a chart with
6Generally, a mapping ‚àÇ: R ‚ÜíL from a ring R to a left R-module L is derivation if ‚àÇ(x¬∑y) =
x‚àÇ(y) + y‚àÇ(x), x, y ‚ààR. The case when R is an algebra, which in turn is a linear space over K,
is frequently met in the diÔ¨Äerential geometry. In the last case on ‚àÇis added the restriction to be
K-linear.
7We make a clear distinction between the concepts ‚Äòpath‚Äô and ‚Äòcurve‚Äô. By a curve or geometric
curve we understand an equivalence class of paths with respect to some set of changes of the
path‚Äôs parameter. More precisely, let T be some set of bijective mappings between the R-intervals,
two paths Œ≥a : Ja ‚ÜíA, with a = 1, 2 and A being a non-empty set, are equivalent (with respect
to T) if there is œÑ ‚ààT such that Œ≥2 = Œ≥1 ‚ó¶œÑ and J2 = œÑ(J1). This is an equivalence relation on
the set of paths in A. Any equivalence class [Œ≥] of paths equivalent to Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíA is called a curve.
Any path of a curve [Œ≥] provides a ‚Äòparameterization‚Äô of the set Œ≥(J) ‚äÜA which sometimes is
also called a curve. Most often as T is chosen the class of (C0, C1, . . . ) diÔ¨Äeomorphisms between
the real intervals.
8If J has end point(s) and s is such a point, the derivative in (2.3) is considered as one-sided,
resp. ÀôŒ≥(s) is one-sided tangent vector to Œ≥ at the endpoint(s).

generated by the local coordinates {xi}) while {Ei|p} is called non-coordinate. For
any basis {Ei|p} there exist local coordinates with respect to which it is coordinate
(see Lemma II.5.2 on page 116).
The set of all tangent vectors on a manifold M is denoted by T (M), i.e.,
T (M) := ‚à™p‚ààMTp(M), and is called tangent bundle space.
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.4. A (tangent) vector Ô¨Åeld on U ‚äÜM is a mapping X assigning to
each p ‚ààU a (tangent) vector Xp at p, i.e., X : p ‚ÜíXp ‚ààTp(M).
If U is clear from the context or if U = M, we speak simply of a vector Ô¨Åeld.
Example 2.7. If Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a C1 path without self-intersections, the mapping
ÀôŒ≥ : Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s), ÀôŒ≥(s) being the vector tangent to Œ≥ at Œ≥(s) (see (2.3)), is an
important example of a vector Ô¨Åeld over Œ≥(J). It is called tangent to Œ≥ vector
Ô¨Åeld.11
The set X(U) of the vector Ô¨Åelds on U is a linear space over K; for the purpose
we put (Œ±X + Œ≤Y ): p ‚ÜíŒ±Xp + Œ≤Yp with Œ±, Œ≤ ‚ààK, p ‚ààU, and X, Y ‚ààX(U).
Moreover, this set can naturally be turned into a (left) module over the ring
(algebra in this case) F(U) of functions on U; this is done by deÔ¨Åning (fX +
gY ): p ‚Üíf(p)Xp + g(p)Yp with f, g: U ‚ÜíK.
There is a naturally deÔ¨Åned action of the vector Ô¨Åelds on C1 functions, viz. a
vector Ô¨Åeld X on U ‚äÜM can be regarded as a mapping F1(U) ‚ÜíF(U) by setting
X : f ‚ÜíXf := X(f) with X(f): p ‚ÜíXp(f) for all p ‚ààU and f ‚ààF1(U).
11If Œ≥ is not injective, the mapping ÀôŒ≥ : Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s) may turn to be multiple-valued at the
points of self-intersection.

(2.13)
where the functions
Xi := X(xi) = X(ri ‚ó¶œï): U ‚ÜíK
(2.14)
are called components of X with respect to {xi} or (U, œï).
It is important to be noted that the set of vector Ô¨Åelds X(U) is a Ô¨Ånitely
generated (left) F(U)-module of rank n = dim M (see (2.13)) but it is also inÔ¨Ånitely
dimensional linear (vector) space over K. A basis in the former case is formed by
the vector Ô¨Åelds { ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi }. This basis is called associated to (generated by) the local
coordinates {xi} or the chart (U, œï).
By virtue of (2.8), (2.9), (2.13), and (2.14), a change (U, œï) ‚Üí(U ‚Ä≤, œï‚Ä≤) of the
chart implies the transforms

We call a basis {Ei} of the module of vector Ô¨Åelds on (over) U a frame on
(over) U.12 So, a frame on U is a collection of dim M vector Ô¨Åelds on U such that
at every point p ‚ààU they form a basis of Tp(M). At a single point p, U = {p},
the concepts ‚Äòbasis in Tp(M)‚Äô and ‚Äòframe on (over, at) p‚Äô are synonyms.
The frame

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

on U is referred as a coordinate (or natural) one (associated
with or generated by the local coordinates {xi}) while a general frame {Ei} is
referred as a noncoordinate frame. A frame {Ei} is called holonomic on U if
there exist local coordinates {xi} on U such that Ei = ‚àÇ/‚àÇxi, i.e., if {Ei} is the
associated with {xi} coordinate frame. Otherwise, if such {xi} do not exist, the
frame is called anholonomic.13 Equivalently, the holonomic (resp. anholonomic)
frames can be deÔ¨Åned as ones whose basic vector Ô¨Åelds commute (resp. do not
commute); for details vide infra Section 8.

anholonomic way. (Cf. Remark 5.1 on page 40 or see Lemma II.5.2 on page 116.)

2. DiÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds
13
A vector Ô¨Åeld X on U ‚äÜM, M being a Ck diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold, is said
to be diÔ¨Äerentiable of class Cr, or simply is called Cr (vector) Ô¨Åeld, with r ‚â§k if
for every Cr+1 function f : U ‚ÜíK the function X(f): U ‚ÜíK is of class Cr. A
vector Ô¨Åeld is of class Cr if and only if its local components are Cr functions in
any local chart (see (2.13)). The (left) module of all Cr vector Ô¨Åelds on U will be
denoted by Xr(U).
DeÔ¨Åne the bracket, called also Lie bracket or commutator, of two C1 vector
Ô¨Åelds X, Y ‚ààX1(U) by14
[X, Y ] := X ‚ó¶Y ‚àíY ‚ó¶X.
(2.18)
In local coordinates {xi}, the local components of [X, Y ] are [X, Y ]j = Xj ‚àÇY i
‚àÇxj ‚àí
Y j ‚àÇXi
‚àÇxj ; in an arbitrary frame, we have [X, Y ]j = X(Y i) ‚àíY (Xi). The set X1(U)
is an inÔ¨Ånitely dimensional Lie algebra over the Ô¨Åeld K under the operation
[ ¬∑ , ¬∑ ] : X1(U) √ó X1(U) ‚ÜíX(U).
A frame {Ei} on a neighborhood (open set) U ‚äÜM is holonomic if and only
if [Ej, Ek] |U = 0 (see Section 8 for some details).
Further, in Subsection IV.2.4, we shall look on the tangent vector Ô¨Åelds as
sections of the tangent bundle over a manifold.
Let X ‚ààX0(U) and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU be a C1 path in a neighborhood U ‚äÜM. The
path Œ≥ is called integral path (curve) for X through p ‚ààU if
ÀôŒ≥(s) = XŒ≥(s),
Œ≥(s0) = p
(2.19)
for some Ô¨Åxed s0 ‚ààJ end every s ‚ààJ. Through every p ‚ààU passes a (locally)
unique integral path for X; so if two integral paths have a common point, they
(locally) coincide.15 On the opposite, if U is Ô¨Ålled with a family of non-intersecting
C1 paths passing through every its point, there exists a unique C1 vector Ô¨Åeld on
U whose integral paths form the given family of paths. It coincides with the Ô¨Åeld
of vectors tangent to the paths of the family.
Let f : M ‚ÜíN be a C1 mapping between C1 manifolds M and N and
p ‚ààM. The diÔ¨Äerential or induced tangent mapping f‚àó|p of f at p, denoted also
by dfp ‚â°df|p and f ‚Ä≤
p ‚â°f ‚Ä≤|p, is a linear mapping
f‚àó|p : Tp(M) ‚ÜíTf(p)(N)
(2.20)
such that, for all Xp ‚ààTp(M) and all g: N ‚ÜíK diÔ¨Äerentiable at f(p),
(f‚àó|p(Xp))(g) := Xp(g ‚ó¶f).
(2.21)
Evidently, f‚àó|p is a linear mapping. Its matrix, in the coordinate bases associ-
ated to charts (U, œï) of M and (V, œà) of N with U ‚àãp and V ‚àãf(p) can be found
14Often the Lie bracket is denoted by [ ¬∑ , ¬∑ ], omitting the minus sign as a subscript.
15For details on integral paths, see, e.g., [9, p. 131Ô¨Ä], [7, Sections 1.46‚Äì1.53] or [8, Sec-
tions 8.5‚Äì8.7].

the Jacobi matrix of the mapping f (with respect to the given coordinate systems).
Example 2.8. If Œ≥ : R ‚ÜíM is a C1 path in a C1 manifold M, s ‚ààR, and we
choose a chart (U, œï) of M with U ‚àãŒ≥(s) and the standard chart (R, idR) of R,
with coordinate function idR (as r1 = idR in the one-dimensional case), then the
diÔ¨Äerential Œ≥‚àó|s at s maps the standard basic vector
‚àÇ

s of Ts(R) into the tangent
vector ÀôŒ≥(s) of Œ≥ at s and the matrix of Œ≥‚àó|s consists of the components of ÀôŒ≥(s) :

Note that often r1 is identiÔ¨Åed with s and one writes ÀôŒ≥i(s) = ‚àÇ(xi‚ó¶Œ≥(s))

.
Analogously, one can prove that the matrix of the diÔ¨Äerential at p ‚ààM of a
function f : M ‚ÜíK is formed from the gradient components of f, i.e., they are
‚àÇ(f‚ó¶œï‚àí1)
‚àÇri
		
œï(p) in appropriate bases.
A C1 mapping f : M ‚ÜíN between C1 manifolds is called regular if its
diÔ¨Äerential f‚àó|p at p ‚ààM is one-to-one (injective) for every p ‚ààM. The above
example (with interval J for R) shows that a C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is regular iÔ¨Ä
its tangent vector ÀôŒ≥ is non-zero everywhere. Generally, a mapping f : M ‚ÜíN is

2. DiÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds
15
regular iÔ¨ÄdimR M ‚â§dimR N and the Jacobi matrix of f in some (and hence in
any) bases has maximum rank, equal to dimR M (in real terms).
Details concerning the diÔ¨Äerential of C1 mappings can be found in most of
the standard (text)books on diÔ¨Äerential geometry, for instance, in [10,11,15].
2.4.
Covectors and covector Ô¨Åelds
The vector space T ‚àó
p (M)
dual to the tangent space Tp(M), p ‚ààM, consists of
the linear forms on Tp(M). It is called the cotangent (vector) space to M at p
and is of dimension n = dim M. The elements of T ‚àó
p (M) are referred as covectors,
covariant vectors, or covariant tangent vectors at p. For Xp ‚ààTp(M), the covector
œâp ‚ààT ‚àó
p (M) is a linear mapping16
œâp : Xp ‚Üíœâp(Xp) ‚ààK

rarely used. The wide spread case is a transform {Ei|p} ‚Üí{E‚Ä≤ i|p} induced by a
change {Ei|p} ‚Üí{E‚Ä≤
i|p = Aj
i (p)Ej|p} of the dual basis in Tp(M). In this situation,
by (2.24), we have
Ei

(2.25)
while the covectors‚Äô components transform like (cf. (2.12))
œâp i ‚Üíœâ‚Ä≤
p i = Aj
i(p)œâp j.
(2.26)
Hence, under (2.11) the covectors‚Äô components transform like a basis of vectors
and the vectors‚Äô components change like a cobasis (basis of covectors).
16Sometimes the notation œâp : Xp ‚Üí‚ü®œâp, Xp‚ü©is used. It expresses the action of the Kronecker
(unit) tensor (see below) on the ordered pair (œâp, Xp). We prefer to reserve the symbol ‚ü®¬∑ , ¬∑ ‚ü©for
the scalar products in quantum mechanics as accepted in this theory. More precisely, at present,
in it the symbol ‚ü®¬∑ | ¬∑ ‚ü©for the Hermitian scalar product is used which sometimes is replaced by
‚ü®¬∑ , ¬∑ ‚ü©or ( ¬∑ , ¬∑ ).

A covariant vector (covector) Ô¨Åeld œâ on U ‚äÜM is a mapping assigning to
each p ‚ààU a covector at p, œâ: p ‚Üíœâp ‚ààT ‚àó
p (M). It is often called a one-form
(abbreviated to 1-form), or diÔ¨Äerential form of degree 1.18 Equivalently, a 1-form
œâ on U can be considered (deÔ¨Åned) as F(U)-linear mapping from the (left) F(U)-
module X(U) into F(U) given by
œâ: X ‚Üíœâ(X),
œâ(X): p ‚Üíœâp(Xp),
X ‚ààX(U), p ‚ààU.
(2.30)
In a chart (U, œï), the full diÔ¨Äerentials dxi of the local coordinates {xi} form
a natural basis

dxi
in the set of 1-forms on U which is dual to the basis {‚àÇ/‚àÇxi}
in X(U):
œâ = œâidxi,
dxi
‚àÇ/‚àÇxj
:= Œ¥i
j.
(2.31)
More generally, if {Ei} is a frame on U, i.e., a basis in the module X(U), then in
the dual to it coframe {Ei} we have
œâ = œâiEi,
Ei := (Ei)‚àó,
Ei(Ej) := Œ¥i
j.
(2.32)
In such a pair ({Ei}, {Ei}) of frame and coframe, the mapping œâ: X ‚Üíœâ(X) is
given by œâ(X) = œâiXi ‚ààF(U). The change (2.16) of the frame implies a change
of the dual coframe and of the component of a covector Ô¨Åeld in it:
Ei ‚ÜíE‚Ä≤ i =

œâi ‚Üíœâ‚Ä≤

(2.33)
In a case of a coordinate frame {‚àÇ/‚àÇxi} and its dual coframe {dxi} we, obviously,
obtain
Ai
j = ‚àÇxi
‚àÇx‚Ä≤ j : p ‚Üí‚àÇxi
‚àÇx‚Ä≤ j
			
p = ‚àÇ(xi ‚ó¶œï‚Ä≤ ‚àí1)

œï‚Ä≤(p).
(2.34)
A covector Ô¨Åeld œâ on U is said to be diÔ¨Äerentiable of class Cr if for X ‚ààXr(U)
the function œâ(X) is of class Cr or, equivalently, the components of œâ (in one and
hence in any coframe) are in Fr(U). For brevity such a covector Ô¨Åeld is called Cr
covector Ô¨Åeld (or Cr 1-form).
17Recall that xi := ri ‚ó¶œï and ri : Kn ‚ÜíK is deÔ¨Åned by ri(c1, . . . , cn) := ci, ci ‚ààK.
18With a few exceptions, in this work diÔ¨Äerential forms of degree greater than one (and the
exterior algebra) will not be considered.

Since the tensor product is not commutative, the order of the multipliers in (2.35)
is essential.

All such space with m
a=1(ra + sa) = const are isomorphic but diÔ¨Äerent unless
their types coincide. In the complex case, K = C, some of the space Tp(M) and
T ‚àó
p (M) can be replaced with their complex conjugate spaces ¬ØTp(M) and ¬ØT ‚àó
p (M),
respectively; for instance, a Hermitian metric on a complex manifold M at p is
a Hermitian form on Tp(M) √ó Tp(M) but, equivalently it is a bilinear mapping
Tp(M)√óT p(M) ‚ÜíC whose transpose is equal to its complex conjugate mapping.
In this book only tensor spaces of the type (2.35) will be involved. All results (and
deÔ¨Ånitions) in it can mutatis mutandis be transferred to the above general cases
which is a simple technical problem.
The elements of (2.35) are referred as tensors, or, if their type must be spec-
iÔ¨Åed, tensors of type (r, s) (and rank r + s). They are also called r-contravariant
(r times contravariant) and s-covariant (s times covariant) tensors, or tensors of
contravariant degree r and covariant degree s.
In (2.35) can, of course, be introduced an arbitrary basis Ej1...js

running from 1 to dim M, but this is done very rarely. The interesting case, which
is practically the only one considered in the literature and in our book, is when the
basis is induced by some basis {Ei|p} in Tp(M) and its dual basis {Ei|p := (Ei|p)‚àó}
in T ‚àó

A tensor Ô¨Åeld is of class Cr, or is a Cr (tensor) Ô¨Åeld, if its components are of
class Cr in some, and hence in any, tensor frame. The set of all Ck tensor Ô¨Åelds
of type (r, s) on U will be denote by Tr;k
s (U).
Example 2.9. An example of C‚àûtensor Ô¨Åeld on M is the unit tensor (Ô¨Åeld), called
also the Kronecker tensor (Ô¨Åeld). In any local frame {Ei} it is given by
Ei ‚äóEi =
dim M

i=1
Ei ‚äóEi.
(2.45)
and, consequently, its components are the Kronecker (delta-)symbols:
Œ¥j
i =

1
for i = j
0
for i Ã∏= j .
(2.46)
The algebra T (U) of the tensor Ô¨Åelds on U ‚äÜM is the direct sum of all Tr
s(U)
for r, s ‚â•0 with the tensor product of tensor Ô¨Åelds as algebra‚Äôs multiplication.20
This algebra over the Ô¨Åeld K = R, C is associative but not commutative. If we
restrict ourselves to Cr tensor Ô¨Åelds, the corresponding algebra will be denoted by
T r(U).
At the end of this section, we deÔ¨Åne the contraction operator(s). Let the
integers m, n, r, and s be such that 1 ‚â§m ‚â§r and 1 ‚â§n ‚â§s. The contraction
operator Cm
n (of type (m, n), acting on the mth superscript and nth subscript)
maps a tensor or tensor Ô¨Åeld K of type (r, s) into respectively a tensor or tensor
Ô¨Åeld Cm
n K of type (r ‚àí1, s ‚àí1) such that in any local basis or frame respectively,
we have

This deÔ¨Ånition is independent of the basis or frame in which the last equation is
written; for example, C1
1(Ei ‚äóEi) = Œ¥i
i = dim M and C1
1(œâ ‚äóX) = œâ(X) for
vector (Ô¨Åeld) X and covector (Ô¨Åeld) œâ. Generally two contraction operators do
not commute. If the numbers m and n are arbitrary (and insigniÔ¨Åcant) for some
problem, we shall speak simply of a contraction operator and denote it by C.

Linear connections on a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold
Below we deÔ¨Åne the linear connections on a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold by means of
axiomatic description of the properties of covariant derivative. We give also an
idea of a parallel transport and the connected to it concepts of geodesics and
exponential mapping.
20Note that f ‚äóK = K ‚äóf = fK for f ‚ààF(U) and a tensor Ô¨Åeld K on U. (Cf. footnote 19
on the preceding page.)

Motivation
The comparison of objects deÔ¨Åned or given at diÔ¨Äerent points is the main idea
and task of the theory of connections.1 The mathematical structures by means of
which this is done are known as connections. In more free and general language,
by this term is understand any rule for implicit or explicit ‚Äòtransportation‚Äô of
objects from one point to another. A typical physical situation where these kind
of problems arise is the following. Given an electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld in a region U
of the space-time M and two (e.g., identical) charged point particles moving in
U. The problems are to compare the velocities of the particles, the forces acting
on them, and to describe (in an invariant way) the relative motion of one of the
particles with respect to the other one. Leaving aside the last problem, the Ô¨Årst
two ones reduce to the comparison of two vectors, say X and Y , deÔ¨Åned at points
p, q ‚ààM and representing the particle‚Äôs velocities or the forces acting on them.
If for the space-time model M is taken R3, as in the classical physics, we can
simply form the diÔ¨Äerence X ‚àíY of X, Y ‚ààR3.2 But if M is a more general
manifold, for instance the one of general relativity, then the diÔ¨Äerence X ‚àíY
is meaningless unless it is explicitly deÔ¨Åned. Just for this purpose a connection is
needed; in this case it must establish a link between the tangent spaces Tp(M) ‚àãX
and Tq(M) ‚àãY . If this is done appropriately, we can deÔ¨Åne X ‚àíY as, e.g.,
X ‚àí¬ØY ‚ààTp(M) where ¬ØY ‚ààTp(M) is the vector corresponding to Y ‚ààTq(M)
with respect to the connection. As one can expect, such a procedure is not unique
(if it exists) and when physical problems, like the above one, are investigated,
the correct correspondence between the theory‚Äôs predictions and the Nature is the
only criteria that can select the ‚Äòright‚Äô connection.
Without any doubts, the natural scene where the connections ‚Äòlive‚Äô are the
(Ô¨Åbre) bundles (see Section V.3) which is clearly reÔ¨Çected in the modern math-
ematical literature [10‚Äì12, 16] where the connection theory is primary described
in terms of Ô¨Åbre bundles and only then is speciÔ¨Åed on manifolds. But we shall
not follow this general approach for the following reasons. The historical order of
events is just the opposite and for the main purpose of this book, the description
of normal frames, is better if it is followed. This is justiÔ¨Åed and from pedagogical
view-point: beginning with simple concepts, we step by step generalize them, the
positive results at a lower level being a motivation for further developments of
the theory. Besides, until recently (1992) the normal frames ware known only for
symmetric linear connections and the presentation of general results (with a few
applications at the moment) at the beginning may cause some phycological prob-
lems and push away the reader, especially if he/she is a physicists. At last, the
1In the old literature (see, e.g., [19]) the word ‚Äòconnexion‚Äô instead of ‚Äòconnection‚Äô is used.
Nowadays this is rarely done [10,28].
2More precisely, the velocities X and Y are elements of the tangent spaces Tp(R3) and Tq(R3)
which are naturally identiÔ¨Åed with R3, where, after the identiÔ¨Åcation is done, the diÔ¨Äerence X‚àíY
is formed. In fact, this implicit convention is a connection on R3. The situation, when X and Y
represent forces, is similar to the one when these vector Ô¨Åelds represent velocities.

3. Linear connections on manifolds
21
physical applications of the normal frames concern at present mainly the gravity
physics.
In the connection theory there are two basic concepts, a ‚Äòconnection‚Äô and
‚Äòparallel transport‚Äô, the latter being called sometimes ‚Äòparallel translation‚Äô [22,
Chapter VII, ¬ß 5]. In the majority of the literature, the connection is taken as
a primitive one and the parallel transport is deÔ¨Åned on its base. We shall follow
this approach in the present and the next two chapters. It is also possible to take
as an initial concept the parallel transport and on its ground to deÔ¨Åne what a
connection is (see, e.g., [23]). This point of view is, by our opinion, more general
(and diÔ¨Écult) and we utilize it in Chapter IV.
3.2.
Basic deÔ¨Ånitions
The shortest way to come to the concept ‚Äòconnection‚Äô on a manifold M is to try
to deÔ¨Åne what a ‚Äòderivative of a C1 vector Ô¨Åeld‚Äô is. The direct transferring of the
deÔ¨Ånition of the derivative of a C1 function K ‚ÜíK is impossible since the dif-
ference Xp ‚àíXq, X ‚ààX1(U), p, q ‚ààU ‚äÜM is not deÔ¨Åned for q Ã∏= p. If p and q
belong to one and the same coordinate neighborhood U, the quantities Xi
p ‚àíXi
q
and ‚àÇXi
p/‚àÇxi, with {xi} being local coordinate system in U, are well deÔ¨Åned but
are not components of a vector (Ô¨Åeld). It is well known that these quantities can
be ‚Äòrepaired‚Äô (redeÔ¨Åned) in such a way that this results in the (equivalent in this
context) concepts parallel transport [20] and covariant derivative(‚â°connection
here) [21], respectively. This approach is typical for the elementary textbooks on
general relativity, as the above-cited. Below we present an equivalent to these
methods axiomatical point of view which is almost standard for the modern dif-
ferential geometry.3
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1. A linear connection (or covariant derivative) ‚àáin (on) a neighbor-
hood U ‚äÜM, M being C1 manifold, is a mapping assigning to every vector Ô¨Åeld
X on U a mapping ‚àáX, called covariant derivative along X, of the tensor algebra
of C1 tensor Ô¨Åelds on U into the algebra of tensor Ô¨Åelds on U, i.e., ‚àá: X ‚Üí‚àáX,
X ‚ààX(U) with ‚àáX : T 1(U) ‚ÜíT (U), such that:
(i) ‚àáX+Y = ‚àáX + ‚àáY ,
X, Y ‚ààX(U);
(ii) ‚àáfX = f‚àáX,
f ‚ààF(U);
(iii) ‚àáX(K + L) = ‚àáXK + ‚àáXL,

specialized literature on diÔ¨Äerential geometry; see, e.g., [9,11,12].

Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
Comments 3.1. There exist a number of equivalent deÔ¨Ånitions of a linear connec-
tion on a manifold. For this reason, we make below some remarks on the above
one:
(1) Conditions (i) and (ii) specify that ‚àáis F(U)-linear with respect to the vector
Ô¨Åelds along which (in the direction of which) it acts.
(2) Condition (iii) means that ‚àáX is compatible with the additive structure of
the tensor algebra on U.
(3) According to the Leibnitz rule/formula (iv), ‚àáX is a derivation with respect
to the tensor multiplication, i.e., it is a derivation of T1(U).
(4) The conditions (v) mean that the covariant derivative maps C1 functions in
functions and C1 vector/covector Ô¨Åelds in vector/covector Ô¨Åelds. Taking this
into account, one can derive from (iii) and (iv) that ‚àáX preserves the types
of the tensor Ô¨Åelds. That is why often (va)‚Äì(vc) are replaced by the demand
‚àáX to be type-preserving, but this is partially contained in the preceding
axioms.
(5) Conditions (i)‚Äì(v) uniquely deÔ¨Åne ‚àáX up to its action on C1 functions, vector
and covector Ô¨Åelds. This arbitrariness in the deÔ¨Ånition of ‚àáX is considerably
reduced by (vi) and (vii): Condition (vi) deÔ¨Ånes ‚àáX on C1 functions while
from (vii) follows that it is uniquely deÔ¨Åned if its action on C1 vector (or,
equivalently, covector) Ô¨Åelds is Ô¨Åxed.
(6) Often condition (vii) is formulated as: ‚àáX commutes with the contraction
operator C, i.e., [‚àáX, Cr
s] = 0 for every r, s ‚ààN. Such a general demand is
not needed as it follows from the presented axioms.
For the conditions under which a manifold admits linear connections, the
reader is referred to the books on diÔ¨Äerential geometry cited in Section 1; in
particular, to those problems are devoted [11, Chapter II, ¬ß 2] and [22, Chap-
ter VII, ¬ß 3].
Below we suppose on a manifold M (of class at least C1) to be given a linear
connection ‚àá. Everything of what follows can be speciÔ¨Åed in an evident way on a
neighborhood U ‚äÇM.
Let {Ei} be a C1 frame on U ‚äÜM. The (local) coeÔ¨Écients Œìi

of a linear connection ‚àáon U are deÔ¨Åned by the expansion (see DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1,

for a special kind of Œìi
jk on a Riemannian manifold (see Section 4 and footnote 9 on page 36).
Note the order of the indices j and k in the both sides of (3.1). In some works, like [11, 12], in
the right-hand side of (3.1) instead of Œìi
jk stands Œìi
kj. This results in the change of signs before
certain terms in some equations.

of the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection ‚àá. Because of the importance of this result
for the present book, we will rewrite it in the case of frames associated with two

Note, in this result enter the second partial derivatives of the local coordinates,
so it is meaningful if the manifold M is of class not less than C2 which will be
supposed in this and the next chapters.
Consequently, a linear connection ‚àádeÔ¨Ånes in any frame {Ei} a family of
functions {Œìi
jk} which transform according to (3.5). The opposite statement is
also true (see, e.g., [11, Chapter III, Proposition 7.3]): if in every frame {Ei} is
given a family of functions {Œìi
jk} satisfying the transformation law (3.5), then
there exists a unique linear connection ‚àáwhose local coeÔ¨Écients in {Ei} coincide
with {Œìi
jk}.
5Notice, here and below we suppose the frames and the matrix-valued function A to be deÔ¨Åned
on a neighborhood (open set) in M of each point in U, i.e., on a neighborhood of U if U is not
a neighborhood. Otherwise expressions like Ek(Ai
j) may turn to be not (uniquely) deÔ¨Åned.

The set of linear connections on M is not F(M)-linear or even K-linear space.
In fact, if ‚àáand ¬Ø‚àáare linear connections with coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
jk and ¬ØŒìi
jk respec-
tively and f, g ‚ààF(M), then we can deÔ¨Åne f‚àá+g ¬Ø‚àáas a ‚Äòlinear connection‚Äô whose
local coeÔ¨Écients are fŒìi
jk + g¬ØŒìi
jk but, by virtue of (3.5), one veriÔ¨Åes easily (see
the last term in (3.5)) that these functions form coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection
if and only if f + g = 1.6 So, the only K-linear (resp. F(M)-linear) combination
under which the set of linear connection is closed is

where f ‚ààK (resp. f ‚ààF(M)). This result is often mentioned when f = 1/2.
If we restrict ourselves to coordinate frames, i.e., to ones associated with local
coordinates, then, due to (3.6), the quantities fŒìi

in some coordinate frame. This is an example of symmetric linear connection.
Generally a linear connection is called symmetric if in one (and hence in any ‚Äì
see (3.6)) coordinate frame {‚àÇ/‚àÇxi} its local coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
jk are symmetric in
their subscripts:
Œìi
jk = Œìi
kj.
(3.10)
Often these equations are written as
Œìi
kj = Œìi
(kj)
or
Œìi
[kj] = 0
(3.10‚Ä≤)
where symmetrization (resp. antisymmetrization) is understood over the indices
included in round (resp. square) brackets (see the list of conventions, page xii).
It is important to be emphasized, in the general case it is meaningful to be spo-
ken on the symmetry properties of the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection only in
coordinate frames. The same is valid with respect to the transform (3.8), or its spe-
cial case (3.9): if (anholonomic) non-coordinate frames are involved, the quantities
f¬ØŒì
i
jk generally do not deÔ¨Åne coeÔ¨Écients of some linear connection.
Now we want to deÔ¨Åne what a Cr linear connection, called also linear con-
nection of class Cr or Cr diÔ¨Äerentiable linear connection, on a Ck manifold is.7
6Notice, for g = ‚àíf we get the quantities f

which are components of a tensor
Ô¨Åeld of type (1, 2).
7In the literature the problem of deÔ¨Åning the diÔ¨Äerentiability of a linear connection does not
arise because usually only the C‚àûcase is considered and/or only the class of coordinate frames
is employed (see below and, e.g., [12, p. 295]).

3. Linear connections on manifolds
25
Our intention is to call ‚àáa Cr diÔ¨Äerentiable if its local coeÔ¨Écients are of class
Cr but this is not quite rigorous. Actually, if its coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
jk in a frame {Ei}
are Cr functions, then in another frame {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej} the diÔ¨Äerentiability of the
new coeÔ¨Écients Œì‚Ä≤ i
jk will depend, in conformity with (3.5), on of what class the
transformation nondegenerate matrix A = [Aj
i] is. If Aj
i are of class Cr‚Ä≤, then that
of Œì‚Ä≤ i
jk will be Cmin(r,r‚Ä≤‚àí1). Consequently the diÔ¨Äerentiability of the coeÔ¨Écients
of a linear connection is essentially frame-dependent concept. For this reason,
we adopt the following deÔ¨Ånition. Given a class of frames connected with linear
transformations whose matrices are Cr‚Ä≤, r‚Ä≤ ‚â•1 matrix-valued functions, a linear
connection is said to be Cr diÔ¨Äerentiable with r ‚â§r‚Ä≤ ‚àí1 with respect to it if
its local coeÔ¨Écients are of class Cr with respect to one (and hence relative to
any) frame in the given set of frames. Beginning with this point henceforth, when
speaking of a Cr linear connection, we shall suppose, by default if the opposite is
not explicitly stated, that the above class of Cr‚Ä≤, r‚Ä≤ ‚â•r + 1, frames is Ô¨Åxed and
consists of all frames associated to (one or all systems of) local coordinates on
the Ck, k ‚â•r‚Ä≤ + 1 ‚â•r + 2, manifold or some its open subset and all frames that
can be obtained from them by means of Cr‚Ä≤ linear transformations. For example,
talking of a C1 linear connection, we have in mind that it is a linear connection
on C3 manifold and such that its local coeÔ¨Écients in (one or) any frame, which is
coordinate or obtainable from a coordinate one by means of C2 changes, are C1
functions.8
We shall now introduce two basic characteristics of the linear connections
which will be mentioned frequently in this book.
The curvature tensor Ô¨Åeld (or simply curvature), R, and the torsion tensor
Ô¨Åeld (or simply torsion), T , of a linear connection ‚àáare tensor Ô¨Åelds of types
respectively (1, 3) and (1, 2), i.e.,
R: T0

deÔ¨Åned as follows. The curvature R for a C1 linear connection ‚àáon a C3 mani-
fold M is considered as an F(M)-trilinear mapping √ó3X(M) ‚ÜíX(M) such that
(X, Y, Z) ‚ÜíR(X, Y )Z, X, Y, Z ‚ààX(M), where the curvature operator (called also
simply curvature) R(X, Y ) (along the pair (X, Y )) is
R(X, Y ) := ‚àáX ‚ó¶‚àáY ‚àí‚àáY ‚ó¶‚àáX ‚àí‚àáX‚ó¶Y ‚àíY ‚ó¶X ‚â°

‚àáX, ‚àáY

‚àí‚àá[X,Y ] . (3.11)
Analogously, the torsion T of an arbitrary linear connection ‚àáon a manifold
M is treated as an F(M)-bilinear mapping X(M) √ó X(M) ‚ÜíX(M) such that
(X, Y ) ‚ÜíT (X, Y ), X, Y, ‚ààX(M), where the torsion operator (called also simply
torsion) T (X, Y ) (along the pair (X, Y )) is
T (X, Y ) := ‚àáXY ‚àí‚àáY X ‚àí[X, Y ] .

connection, see Section V.3.2.

Remark 3.1. Nevertheless that the torsion is deÔ¨Åned for arbitrary linear connec-
tion on every manifold, this concept is intrinsically linked to the module of vector
Ô¨Åelds on the manifold, or, equivalently, to the tangent bundle to it, and can not
be generalized on more general bundles. On the other hand, the concept of curva-
ture survives a generalizations on vector bundles endowed with linear connections
(or, more generally, linear transports along paths), as well as for connections on
diÔ¨Äerentiable bundles.
In a local frame {Ei}, the components of the curvature R, Ri
jkl, and torsion
T , T i
jk, are deÔ¨Åned by the expansions
R(Ek, El)Ej =: Ri

T (Ej, Ek) =: T i

A linear connection with zero curvature (resp. torsion) on ‚äÜM is called Ô¨Çat,
or curvature free, or integrable (resp. torsionless or torsion free) on U. If U = M
it is call simply Ô¨Çat (resp. torsionless).
Comparing (3.10) with (3.14), we see that a linear connection is symmetric
on U ‚äÜM iÔ¨Äit is torsion free on U. So, the vanishment of the torsion is the
invariant way to describe what a symmetric linear connection is.
The properties and geometric interpretation of curvature and torsion, as well
as that of linear connections as a whole, are well known and investigated at length
in the books on diÔ¨Äerential geometry pointed in Section 1.
3.3.
Parallel transport
The concept of a ‚Äòparallel transport‚Äô, Ô¨Årst introduced on surfaces by Levi-Civita
in 1917 [29], will be employed in the present and subsequent chapters mainly for
many purposes, e.g., for proving and formulating some results. Besides this, we
include here a small subsection devoted to it also for the following reasons:
(i) The parallel transport is the practical realization of the ideas underlying the
connection theory (see subsection 3.1);

3. Linear connections on manifolds
27
(ii) Up to this point we have introduce the full ‚Äòmachinery‚Äô required for describing
what a parallel transport associated to (deÔ¨Åned by) a linear connection is;
(iii) This concept can be deÔ¨Åned independently of the connection theory by a
system of axioms and on its base the (linear) connection can (equivalently)
be introduced [17, 23, 30‚Äì33] (see also Section IV.11, DeÔ¨Ånitions IV.11.2
and IV.11.3);
(iv) As we shall see in Chapter IV, the ‚Äòtransport theory‚Äô is extremely suitable for
exploring normal frames in vector bundles, in particular for arbitrary linear
connections in them.
Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, J being R-interval, be a C1 path in a manifold M endowed
with a linear connection ‚àá. Let V ‚ààX(U) be arbitrary vector Ô¨Åeld on a neighbor-
hood U ‚äÉŒ≥(J) and such that V |Œ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥, ÀôŒ≥ being the vector Ô¨Åeld tangent to Œ≥
(see (2.3)), i.e., VŒ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥(s), s ‚ààJ.9 Consider the restriction of the action of ‚àáV
on Œ≥(J):
‚àáÀôŒ≥(K) := (‚àáV K)|Œ≥(J),
(‚àáÀôŒ≥K)|Œ≥(s) := DK
ds := (‚àáV K)|Œ≥(s).
(3.16)
The operator ‚àáÀôŒ≥ is called covariant derivative along the path Œ≥. In an arbitrary
frame on U, due to (2.3), (3.2), and (3.3), we see that, for any tensor Ô¨Åeld K ‚àà
Tr;1
r‚Ä≤ (U), the tensor Ô¨Åeld ‚àáÀôŒ≥K given by ‚àáÀôŒ≥K : Œ≥(s) ‚Üí(‚àáV K)Œ≥(s) is independent
of U and of the values Vp and Kp for p ‚ààU\Œ≥(J):

DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2. The parallel transport (along paths or curves) assigned to a C0
linear connection ‚àáis a mapping P: Œ≤ ‚ÜíPŒ≤ which, for every C1 path Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚Üí
M,10 a, b ‚ààR, a ‚â§b, puts into correspondence a mapping PŒ≤ : T Œ≤(a) ‚ÜíT Œ≤(b)
from the tensor algebra at Œ≤(a) into the one at Œ≤(b) such that if K0 ‚ààT Œ≤(a), then
9Here we implicitly suppose Œ≥ to be injective as otherwise ÀôŒ≥ : Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s) may not be a
single-valued mapping (see footnote 11 on page 11). However (see Remark 3.3 on the following
page), taking (3.17) as a deÔ¨Ånition for ‚àáÀôŒ≥K, the next considerations hold for arbitrary, injective
or non-injective, paths.
10With [a, b] = {x ‚ààR : a ‚â§x ‚â§b} we denote a real closed interval with end points a, b ‚ààR
such that a ‚â§b. Similarly, by (a, b] = {x ‚ààR : a < x ‚â§b} and [a, b) = {x ‚ààR : a ‚â§x < b}
we denote real intervals closed from right and left, respectively, and opened from left and right,
respectively, and with end points a, b ‚ààR such that a < b. The notation (a, b) = {x ‚ààR : a <
x < b} will stand for an open from both end points a, b ‚ààR, with a < b, real interval.

28
Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
PŒ≤(K0) := KŒ≤(b), where K is a tensor Ô¨Åeld on Œ≤([a, b]) of the same type as K0 and
is deÔ¨Åned as the unique solution of the initial-value problem
‚àáÀôŒ≤K = 0,
KŒ≤(a) = K0.
(3.18)
Remark 3.2. According to (3.17), the problem (3.18) reduces in a local frame to
a Ô¨Årst-order system of ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equations with respect to the local
components of K with initial condition at s = a. This initial-value problem has
a unique solution along Œ≤ by virtue of the existence and uniqueness theorems for
such systems [34].
Remark 3.3. By (3.17), the solution K of (3.18) depends, generally, explicitly on Œ≤,
i.e., the value KŒ≤(s) for s ‚àà[a, b] generally depends on s and Œ≤ separately, not only
on the combination Œ≤(s); in particular, at the points of self-intersection of Œ≤, if any,
K may be multiple-valued (as a tensor Ô¨Åeld). The right and natural interpretation
of K is as a lifting of Œ≤ from M to the bundle space of the tensor bundle of the
same type as K0. This fact will become important in Chapter IV where it will be
treated appropriately. If Œ≤ is injective, i.e., without self-intersections, K is ordinary
(single-valued) tensor Ô¨Åeld over Œ≤([a, b]). So, to be more precise, one should write
KŒ≤ and KŒ≤(s) for K and K(Œ≤(s)) respectively, and, according to (3.17), the symbol
(‚àáÀôŒ≤K)(s), denoting the covariant derivative of (a lifting of paths) K along Œ≤ at
s ‚àà[a, b], should be deÔ¨Åned by

(3.19)
The reader is referred to Chapter IV, in particular to Sections IV.11, IV.14,
and IV.3 for further details concerning the deÔ¨Ånition of a parallel transport and
its links with the concept of lifting (of paths).
Remark 3.4. Since in the present book, with an exception of Section IV.14 and
Chapter V, only linear connection on manifolds and respectively parallel transports
assigned to such connections will be employed, we shall implicitly understood,
when talking about parallel transports, that they are with respect to (assigned to)
some linear connection on a manifold, if this is not explicitly stated.
The properties of the parallel transport are well-known and can be found in
practically every book on diÔ¨Äerential geometry covering the connection theory, e.g
in [11,22]. We will mention only some of them: (i) The transport along Œ≤ depends
on the set Œ≤([a.b]), not on its particular parameterization; (ii) It depends only on

3. Linear connections on manifolds
29
Œ≤(a) and Œ≤(b) iÔ¨Ä‚àáis Ô¨Çat; (iii) To product of paths corresponds the composition
of the corresponding transports; (iv) The mapping PŒ≤ is a linear isomorphism.
Thus the parallel transport generated by a linear connection realizes the
general ideas presented in Subsection 3.1. In particular, by its help we can give
sense to operations with tensors deÔ¨Åned at diÔ¨Äerent points, say p, q ‚ààM, p Ã∏= q,
by parallelly transporting, e.g., the tensors at p to q along some path connecting
p and q.11 For instance, we can compare two vectors X ‚ààTp(M) and Y ‚ààTq(M)
by forming, e.g, the diÔ¨Äerence Y ‚àíPŒ≤(X) for some path Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM such that
Œ≤(a) = p and Œ≤(b) = q (see footnote 11).
Remark 3.5. Above we implicitly supposed the existence of a C1 path Œ≤ in M
connecting the (arbitrary) points p and q. This is true if M is simply connected. If
M is multiply connected, then always exist paths joining every p, q ‚ààM but such
a path can be chosen in a smooth way, i.e., of class C1 or higher, iÔ¨Äp and q belong
to a simply connected region of M. Since, by deÔ¨Ånition, the parallel transport is
deÔ¨Åned only along C1 paths, when talking of a parallel transport along a path
joining two points in M, we always presuppose that they are situated in a simply
connected subset of M. Moreover, when saying that the parallel transport between
two points p and q is path-independent, we have in mind that this is with respect
to reconcilable paths, i.e., ones forming (belonging to) a smooth, C1, homotopy
Œ∑: [a, b] √ó W ‚ÜíM where W is inessential for us non-empty set,12 Œ∑(a, W) = p,
and Œ∑(b, W) = q. Said more freely, the paths connecting p and q are suppose such
that any closed loop formed from every pair of them can smoothly be deformed
to a point in M. This will be presupposed and further in this book. Otherwise
the parallel transport may turn to be path-dependent even in the Ô¨Çat case: such
situation may happen if M is multiply connected and there is a smooth closed path
connection p and q which can not be smoothly contracted to a single point in M.
Remark 3.6. The concept of a parallel transport has a natural generalization
in arbitrary vector bundles, called linear transport along paths. For details, see
Sections IV.3 and IV.11, in particular DeÔ¨Ånition IV.11.1 and Proposition IV.11.1.
For some links between (parallel) transports (along paths) and connections on
diÔ¨Äerentiable bundles, see Section V.8.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.3. A tensor Ô¨Åeld K ‚ààT 1(U), U ‚äÜM is called parallel along a C1
path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU with respect to a linear connection ‚àáif ‚àáÀôŒ≥K = 0. The Ô¨Åeld K is
called parallel (with respect to ‚àá) on U if it is parallel along every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU.
A parallel (along Œ≥) Ô¨Åeld is uniquely deÔ¨Åned by Ô¨Åxing its value K0 at a point
p = Œ≥(c) for some c ‚ààJ; in fact we have KŒ≥(s) = PŒ≥|[c,s](K0), s ‚ààJ, with Œ≥|[c, s]
being the restriction of Œ≥ to [c, s] ‚äÜJ, for c ‚â•s and KŒ≥(s) =

PŒ≥|[s,c]‚àí1(K0)
for c ‚â§s. The Ô¨Åeld K is parallel along Œ≥ iÔ¨ÄKŒ≥(t) = PŒ≥|[t,s](KŒ≥(s)) for t ‚â•s and
11This operation is path dependent unless the connection is Ô¨Çat.
12The set W is a manifold whose real dimension is (dim M ‚àí1) if K = R and (2 dimC M ‚àí1)
for K = C.

Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
KŒ≥(t) =

PŒ≥|[s,t]‚àí1(KŒ≥(s)) for t ‚â§s for all s, t ‚ààJ. A tensor Ô¨Åeld K is parallel on
U ‚äÜM if and only if (‚àáXK)|U = 0 for all X ‚ààX(U).
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.4. A frame {Ei} on U ‚äÜM (resp. along a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM) is called
parallel (on U, resp. along Œ≥) if its basic vector Ô¨Åelds E1, . . . , Edim M are parallel
on U(resp. along Œ≥).
Frames parallel on (dim M)-dimensional submanifolds U, i.e., on neighbor-
hoods, exist iÔ¨Ä‚àáis Ô¨Çat on U.
An almost standard way for construction of a (parallel) frame on some path-
connected Ô¨Çat set U (with respect to a linear connection) is to Ô¨Åx a basis in
Tp(M) for some arbitrarily chosen point p ‚ààU and then to transport parallelly its
vectors, i.e., the whole basis, to every q ‚ààU along some path connecting p and q.
A frame parallel on U is analogous to a Cartesian coordinate system on Rn (see
Chapter IV).
3.4.
Geodesics and exponential mapping
The geodesic paths, called in diÔ¨Äerent contexts also geodesic curves, geodesic lines,
or simply geodesics, in a manifold with connection are in many aspects analogues of
the straight lines in Rn. Historically the introduction of normal frames/coordinates
is primary related to them.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.5. A geodesic or a geodesic path in a C2 manifold endowed with C0
linear connection ‚àáis a C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM whose tangent vector ÀôŒ≥ is parallel
along Œ≥, i.e.,
ÀôŒ≥(s2) =

PŒ≥|[s1,s2] ÀôŒ≥(s1)
for s1, s2 ‚ààJ,
s1 ‚â§s2

PŒ≥|[s2,s1]‚àí1 ÀôŒ≥(s1)
for s1, s2 ‚ààJ,
s2 ‚â§s1
(3.20)
where P is the assigned to ‚àáparallel transport, or, equivalently (however, see
below Remark 3.8),
‚àáÀôŒ≥ ÀôŒ≥ = 0.
(3.21)
This equation, as well as its equivalent local forms (3.22) and (3.23) presented
below, are known as the geodesic equation or equation of the geodesics.
Remark 3.7. In some works, like [18], the paths satisfying (3.21) are called autopar-
allel, the term ‚Äògeodesic‚Äô being reserved for paths satisfying certain Euler-Lagrange
equations (derived from a variational principle) [12, 18]. This is more typical for
the ‚Äòphysically oriented‚Äô literature [35] which is connected with the development
of theories based on manifolds endowed with (more or less independent) linear
connection and Riemannian metric [36, 37]. The more widely accepted modern
mathematical terminology is to call the former paths geodesics and the latter ones
extremals [10,11,19]. That last convention is followed in the present book. We re-
serve the term ‚Äúautoparallels‚Äù or ‚Äúautoparallel paths‚Äù for a certain generalization
of the geodesics to which is devoted Section IV.15.

3. Linear connections on manifolds
31
Remark 3.8. If the C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is not injective, the mapping ÀôŒ≥ : s ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s) ‚àà
TŒ≥(s)(M) cannot be considered as a vector Ô¨Åeld over Œ≥(J) assigning to Œ≥(s) the
value ÀôŒ≥(s) as the mapping Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s) is generally multiple-valued at the points
of self-intersection of Œ≥.13 For this reason, the symbol ‚àáÀôŒ≥ ÀôŒ≥ is not well-deÔ¨Åned if
Œ≥ is not injective. In that case, as well as in the general one, it should be deÔ¨Åned
as a path in T (M) whose local components are deÔ¨Åned by the left-hand side of
equation (3.22) below.
In the domain U of some local frame {Ei}, the geodesic equation (3.21) reads
dÀôŒ≥i
ds + Œìi
jk ÀôŒ≥j ÀôŒ≥k = 0,
s ‚ààJ
(3.22)
where (3.17) was used. If some local coordinate system {xi} is employed and
Ei = ‚àÇ/‚àÇxi, then ÀôŒ≥i = dŒ≥i/ds with Œ≥i = xi ‚ó¶Œ≥, so (3.22) reduces to
d2Œ≥i(s)
ds2
+ Œìi
jk(Œ≥(s))dŒ≥j(s)
ds
dŒ≥k(s)
ds
= 0
s ‚ààJ.
(3.23)
From here a number of immediate observations can be derived:
(i) If Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a geodesic, then so is the path Œ≥ ‚ó¶œÑ, with œÑ : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíJ and
œÑ : t ‚Üíat + b, a, b ‚ààR, a Ã∏= 0, t ‚ààJ‚Ä≤, i.e., a geodesic is mapped into geodesic
under nondegenerate aÔ¨Éne change of its parameter.14
(ii) If Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a geodesic, its restriction Œ≥|J‚Ä≤ to any subinterval J‚Ä≤ ‚äÇJ is
also geodesic.
(iii) If the connection is of class Ck, k ‚â•0 (on Ck+2 manifold), i.e., if Œìi
jk are
of class Ck, any geodesic, which is a C1 path by deÔ¨Ånition, is automatically
a Ck+2 path; in particular the geodesics of C‚àûlinear connection on C‚àû
manifold are C‚àûpaths.
(iv) Since (3.23) is a second-order system of ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equations, from
the theorems of existence and uniqueness of the solutions of such systems [34]
follows that for every point x ‚ààM and every vector X ‚ààTx(M) there exists
a geodesic Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM such that
Œ≥(s0) = x,
ÀôŒ≥(s0) = X
(3.24)
for a Ô¨Åxed s0 ‚ààJ and some interval J. Besides, there is a subinterval J0 ‚äÜJ
such that J0 ‚àãs0 and on J0 all such geodesics coincide. Hence locally, on
J0 ‚àãs0, there is a unique geodesic with initial conditions (3.24). Generally
J0 ‚äÇR. If for every geodesic J0 = R, the connection/manifold is called
(geodesically) complete.
13In fact, ÀôŒ≥ is a lifting of Œ≥ in the tangent bundle over M, not a vector Ô¨Åeld on Œ≥(J); it can be
considered as a vector Ô¨Åeld iÔ¨ÄŒ≥ is injective. For details, see Section IV.2.
14If œÑ(J‚Ä≤) = J, the sets Œ≥(J) and (Œ≥ ‚ó¶œÑ)(J‚Ä≤) coincide, i.e., they represent one and the same
(geometric, unparametrized geometric) curve œÉ = Œ≥(J); see [11, Chapter III, ¬ß 6] and footnote 7
on page 9.

32
Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
(v) The geodesics depend only on the ‚Äòsymmetric‚Äô part of the connection, i.e.,
on the symmetric part Œìi
(jk) of its coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
jk in any frame, coordinate
or not: in particular, since ÀôŒ≥j ÀôŒ≥k = ÀôŒ≥k ÀôŒ≥j, we have the equivalent to (3.23)
equation
d2Œ≥i(s)
ds2
+ Œìi
(jk)(Œ≥(s))dŒ≥j(s)
ds
dŒ≥k(s)
ds
= 0
s ‚ààJ.
(3.23‚Ä≤)
So, if two (or more) linear connections on M generate one and the same
symmetric connection via (3.9), their geodesics coincide.
(vi) A geodesic is either regular or degenerate path: if ÀôŒ≥(s0) = 0 for some s0 ‚ààJ,
then ÀôŒ≥(s) ‚â°0 for every s ‚ààJ as the parallel transport is an isomorphism.
Now we are going to formulate a result which is often used for the proof of
existence of normal frames at a single point.
A geodesic is called maximal if it is not a restriction of other geodesic, i.e.,
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is maximal geodesic if there does not exist a geodesic ¬ØŒ≥ : ¬ØJ ‚ÜíM such
that J ‚äÇ¬ØJ and Œ≥ = ¬ØŒ≥|J. For every point x ‚ààM, every vector X ‚ààTx(M), and
any number s0 ‚ààR there exists a unique maximal geodesic Œ≥s0
x,X : Jm ‚ÜíM deÔ¨Åned
on some interval Jm ‚àãs0 and such that15
Œ≥s0
x,X(s0) = x,
ÀôŒ≥s0
x,X(s0) = X.
(3.25)
Using the uniqueness of the maximal geodesics, one easily veriÔ¨Åes that
Œ≥s0
x,aX(s) = Œ≥s0
x,X(a(s ‚àís0) + s0)
a ‚ààR.
(3.26)
In what follows, we put s0 = 0 (see Remark 3.9 on the next page) and write
Œ≥x,X for Œ≥0
x,X. For this choice, equation (3.26) reads
Œ≥x,aX(s) = Œ≥x,X(as)
s ‚ààJm ‚àã0 ‚ààR,
a ‚ààR.
(3.27)
Let Vx ‚äÜTx(M) be such that Œ≥x,X, with X in Vx, is deÔ¨Åned on interval Jm
containing the point s = 1, Jm ‚àã1 ‚ààR. The set Vx contains, evidently, the zero
vector; besides, by (3.27) it contains also non-zero vectors. We deÔ¨Åne a mapping
expx : Vx ‚ÜíM, called exponential mapping at the point x, by16
expx X := Œ≥x,X(1),
X ‚ààVx.
(3.28)
Due to (3.27), it is fulÔ¨Ålled
expx(sX) = Œ≥x,X(s),
s ‚ààJm ‚àã1,
X ‚ààVx.
(3.29)
The following important result is valid.
15For the proof, see [38, p. 380]. Generally Œ≥s1
x,X and Œ≥s2
x,X are diÔ¨Äerent unless s1 = s2.
16The exponential mapping, exp, itself is deÔ¨Åned via exp: x ‚Üíexpx, x ‚ààM, or by exp: X ‚Üí
expx X for X ‚ààVx ‚äÜTx(M).

4. Riemannian manifolds

Proposition 3.1. For every point x ‚ààM there exists a neighborhood V 0
x of the zero
vector in Tx(M) such that:
(i) It is star-shaped (star-like), i.e., if X ‚ààV 0
x , then aX ‚ààV 0
x for 0 ‚â§a ‚â§1;
(ii) The exponential mapping expx at x is deÔ¨Åned on V 0
x ‚äÜVx ‚äÜTx(M);
(iii) There exists a neighborhood V (x) of x in M such that expx : V 0
x ‚ÜíV (x) is
diÔ¨Äeomorphism.
Proof. See [38, pp. 381‚Äì384], [11, Chapter III, ¬ß 8] or [39, Section 1.6]
‚ñ°
Remark 3.9. The choice s0 = 0 made above is not necessary, it only saves some
writing, simpliÔ¨Åes the formulae, and eliminates from the theory an arbitrary num-
ber (which is insigniÔ¨Åcant at present). For s0 Ã∏= 0 the above construction goes like
this: Let Vs0,x ‚äÜTx(M) be such that Œ≥s0
x,X with X ‚ààVs0,x is deÔ¨Åned on Jm ‚äÜR
containing the point s = s0 + 1, Jm ‚àã(s0 + 1) ‚ààR. The exponential mapping
at x (depending on s0) is exps0,x : Vs0,x ‚ÜíM with exps0,x X := Œ≥s0
x,X(s0 + 1),
X ‚ààVs0,x. So, exps0,x(sX) = Œ≥s0
x,X(s0 + s), (s0 + s) ‚ààJm. Proposition 3.3 remains
true if we replace in it V 0
x , Vx, expx, and V (x) respectively by V 0
s0,x, Vs0,x, exps0,x,
and Vs0(x). At present this generalization does not Ô¨Ånd applications.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.6. A neighborhood V 0
x of the zero vector in Tx(M) having the prop-
erties (i)‚Äì(iii) described in Proposition 3.1 is called normal (neighborhood of 0 ‚àà
Tx(M)). A neighborhood V (x) of x ‚ààM is called normal if it is the image of a
normal neighborhood of the zero vector in Tx(M) under the exponential mapping
(at x), V (x) = expx(V 0
x ).
Therefore the essence of Proposition 3.3 is that every point x ‚ààM admits
normal neighborhoods.
The normal neighborhoods possess a number of remarkable properties de-
scribed, for instance, in [11,38]. They have a straightforward relation to the exis-
tence of normal frames that will be revealed in Section 6 and in Chapter II.
4.
Riemannian manifolds
Freely said, a Riemannian manifold is a real diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold on each tangent
space, considered as a vector space, of which a scalar product is given. When
metrics (scalar or inner products) are concerned, one should clearly distinguish
the real, K = R, and complex, K = C, cases. In the former case the scaler product
is understand as Riemannian metric [10,11], while in the latter case it is assumed
to be a Hermitian metric [10,26,40].1 That is why, usually a real manifold with a
1Formally one can consider a ‚ÄòRiemannian metric‚Äô on a complex manifold as a non-degenerate
bilinear form on it. Such a form is complex-valued and does not deÔ¨Åne a metric or inner product
in the accepted sense [16, p. 2], [10, Chapter I, Section 11]; in particular such a ‚Äòmetric‚Äô does not
deÔ¨Åne a distance function on the manifold and, correspondingly, there is no associated with it
‚Äòmetric topology‚Äô, etc. Regardless of this, if in what follows one considers such forms, all remains
true mutatis mutandis.

34
Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
Riemannian metric is called Riemannian manifold [11] while a complex manifold
with a Hermitian metric is called Hermitian manifold [26].
In this book only Riemannian metrics will be considered as the Hermitian
once require somewhat diÔ¨Äerent treatment which is not primary related to its main
subject.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1. A Riemannian metric g on a subset U ‚äÜM of a real manifold M
is a Ô¨Åeld of symmetric non-degenerate bilinear forms on the tangent spaces at the
points in U, i.e., g is a symmetric non-degenerate tensor Ô¨Åeld in F0
2(U):2
g: x ‚Üígx,
x ‚ààU,
gx : Tx(M) √ó Tx(M) ‚ÜíR,
(4.1a)
gx(Xx, Yx + Zx) = gx(Xx, Yx) + gx(Xx, Zx)
Xx, Yx, Zx ‚ààTx(M),
(4.1b)
gx(Xx, aYx) = agx(Xx, Yx)
a ‚ààR,
Xx, Yx ‚ààTx(M),
(4.1c)
gx(Xx, Yx) = gx(Yx, Xx)
Xx, Yx ‚ààTx(M),
(4.1d)
gx(Xx, Yx) = 0 for all Xx ‚ààTx(M) and some Yx ‚ààTx(M)
‚áê‚áíYx = 0. (4.1e)
A real manifold endowed with a Riemannian metric is called Riemannian
manifold. Below we suppose the existence of a Riemannian metric on the real
manifold M.3
Example 4.1. The n-dimensional Euclidean space En, n ‚ààN, is an almost trivial
example of a Riemannian manifold. It is deÔ¨Åned as Rn endowed with Euclidean
metric e such that e(X, Y ) := n
i=1 XiY i for X = (X1, . . . , Xn) ‚ààRn and Y =
(Y 1, . . . , Y n) ‚ààRn (see footnote 2 on page 20 and Example 7.1 below).
Let g denotes a Riemannian metric on a real manifold M. For any U ‚äÜM,
it induces a Riemannian metric on the set X(U) of vector Ô¨Åelds on U: we deÔ¨Åne
g: X(U) √ó X(U) ‚ÜíF(U) by g: (X, Y ) ‚Üíg(X, Y ) ‚ààF(U), X, Y ‚ààX(U) with
g(X, Y ): x ‚Üígx(Xx, Yx), x ‚ààU.
If X, Y ‚ààTx(M) (resp. X, Y ‚ààX(U)), the number gx(X, Y ) ‚ààR (resp.
the function g(X, Y ) ‚ààF(U)) is called scalar product of the vectors (resp. vector
Ô¨Åelds) X and Y in Tx(M) (resp. in X(U)). In [11, Chapter IV, ¬ß 1] is shown how
the scalar product in Tx(M) (resp. in X(U)) can be extended to a scalar product
in T x
r
s (resp. in Tr
s) for every r, s ‚â•0 with r + s ‚â•1 and that it induces an
isomorphism T x
r
s ‚ÜíT x
r¬±1
s‚àì1 for every r, s ‚â•0 such that r ¬± 1, s ‚àì1 ‚â•0 but these,
otherwise useful, results will not Ô¨Ånd applications in our investigation.
A Riemannian metric g on U is called Cr metric (Cr diÔ¨Äerentiable, (diÔ¨Äer-
entiable) of class Cr) if it is a Cr tensor Ô¨Åeld on U, i.e., g ‚ààT0;r
2 (U).
The Riemannian manifolds of class C2 are interesting for us due to the exis-
tence on them of a ‚Äònatural‚Äô linear connection induced by the metric. This unique
linear connection associate with a C1 Riemannian metric is called Riemannian
2The condition (4.1e) is equivalent to the non-degeneracy only in the Ô¨Ånite-dimensional case,
as we presuppose here.
3See, e.g., [11,12,26] for the existence of such metrics, in particular on paracompact manifolds.

connection, known also as Levi-Civita connection, and it is deÔ¨Åned as a metric-
preserving torsionless linear connection on the respective manifolds. Explicitly this
means that the Riemannian connection ‚àáon U for a C1 metric g on U is deÔ¨Åned
as a C0 linear connection satisfying the system of equations4
‚àáXg = 0
(4.2)
T (X, Y ) := ‚àáXY ‚àí‚àáY X ‚àí[X, Y ] = 0
(4.3)
for all vector Ô¨Åelds X, Y ‚ààX(U). Its solution with respect to ‚àáXY is implicitly
given by [11, Chapter IV, ¬ß 2]5
2g(‚àáXY, Z) = X(g(Y, Z)) + Y (g(X, Z)) ‚àíZ(g(X, Y ))
+ g([X, Y ] , Z) + g([Z, X] , Y ) + g(X, [Z, Y ] )
(4.8)
where X, Y, Z ‚ààX(U) are arbitrary. The explicit solution of this equation for the
Riemannian connection is easily found in some local frame {Ei} on U.
Let
gij := g(Ei, Ej)
(4.9)
be the local (covariant) components of g in {Ei}.6 From DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1 follows that
[gij] is a symmetric non-degenerate matrix-valued function on U:
gij = gji
det[gij] Ã∏= 0, ‚àû.
(4.10)
4The metric preserving condition (4.2) can be expressed in a number of equivalent ways; e.g.,
by ‚àáX(g(Y, Z)) = g(‚àáXY, Z) + g(Y, ‚àáXZ), Z ‚ààX(U) or by saying that the scalar product of
every two vectors does not change after they are parallelly transported along an arbitrary path
in U. A linear connection satisfying only the condition (4.2) is called metric connection; generally
it depends on g and the torsion tensor.
5 Since g(Y, Z) = C1
1(C1
1(g ‚äóY ‚äóZ)), we have
X(g(Y, Z)) = ‚àáX(g(Y, Z)) = (‚àáXg)(Y, Z) + g(‚àáXY, Z) + g(Y, ‚àáXZ).
(4.4)
Making here the cyclic permutations (X, Y, Z) ‚Üí(Y, Z, X) ‚Üí(Z, X, Y ), summing the Ô¨Årst two
equations obtained and subtracting the last one from the result, we get
2g(‚àáXY, Z) = X(g(Y, Z)) + Y (g(Z, X)) ‚àíZ(g(X, Y )) + (‚àáZg)(X, Y ))
‚àí(‚àáX)(Y, Z)) ‚àí(‚àáY g)(Z, X)) + g([X, Y ] , Z) + g([Z, Y ] , X) + g([Z, X] , Y ),
(4.5)
where the torsionless condition (4.3) was used. Now the metricity condition (4.2) reduces this
equation to (4.8). Equation (4.5) is useful, for example, in the Weyl spaces in which (4.2) is
replaced with
‚àáXg = œâ(X)g
(4.6)
for some one-form œâ. A torsionless connection ‚àásatisfying the equation (4.6) is called Weyl
connection [41, 42]; the choice œâ = 0 reduce a Weyl connection to Riemannian one. Let us note
that for a Weyl connection equation (4.13) below is replaced by

where œâi := œâ(Ei) is the ith component of œâ.
6Note, in the real case g(X, Y ) = gijXiY j, while in the complex case, for a Hermitian metric
h, we have h(X, Y ) = gijXiY j where Y j is the complex conjugate to Y j.

(4.11)
The matrix [gij] is also symmetric and non-degenerate.

are the so-called ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols [19, p. 132] 7 of the metric g (induced by g,
assigned to g).8 If we restrict ourselves to the class of (C0) holonomic frames on
U (or on the whole C2 manifold M), then Ci
jk ‚â°0 and the ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols
coincide with the local coeÔ¨Écients of the Riemannian connection in them.9 That
is why the Riemannian connection is often denoted by ‚àá{} (and also by {}‚àáor

‚àá
if the position of the superscripts to ‚àáis reserved for other purposes).
If the ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols are known, from (4.14) we can Ô¨Ånd [18, p. 81] the

7The right-hand side of (4.12) without the last three terms is known as ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols of
the Ô¨Årst kind and is denoted by [ij, k]. That is why (4.14) are also known as ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols
of the second kind. For detains see, e.g., [18] and [24, p. 17]. Nowadays this old terminology,
introduced by E. B. ChristoÔ¨Äel is practically out of usage.
8If the metric g happens to be diagonal in {Ei}, i.e., [gij] = diag(g1, . . . , gdim M) where
diag(a1, . . . , an) means a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements a1, . . . , an, then [gij] =

9For this reason, sometimes, the coeÔ¨Écients of an arbitrary linear connection are called
ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols. This is not quite fair as E.B. ChristoÔ¨Äel introduced his symbols in 1869 [19,
p. 132, footnote 1], [24, p. 17], while the general theory of linear (aÔ¨Éne) connections was devel-
oped more then half a century later, mainly due to the works of E. Cartan.

On a Riemannian manifold whose metric is of class C2 exist two types of
‚Äòprivilege‚Äô paths [11,24]: the geodesics assigned to the Riemannian connection and
the extremals.10 A remarkable result of the Riemannian geometry [11, 12, 24] is
that in it the geodesics and extremals (deÔ¨Åned as paths of minimal, maximal, or
zero length between two points) coincide. Consequently, by (3.23) and (4.13), they
satisfy the equations

The geometry of Riemannian manifolds is one of the best developed branches
of the diÔ¨Äerential geometry. To it is devoted a huge number of woks, some of which
were mentioned in Section 1. The reader is referred to them for deeper concepts
and results in this region.
5.
Normal frames: general ideas
uniqueness, and holonomicity
Any manifold, as we saw in Section 2, is locally Euclidean in a sense that every
its point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to Kn (or its open subset). In sub-
section 3.2, we introduced linear connections on a manifold by means of covariant
derivatives along vector Ô¨Åelds on it. Are the linear connections ‚Äòlocally Euclidean‚Äô?
Are the covariant derivatives ‚Äòlocally looking‚Äô like ordinary derivatives (along vec-
tor Ô¨Åelds or along paths)? At this point these questions are only heuristic and their
rigorous meaning will be revealed further in the present book. Since in any local
frame the components of the covariant derivative of a tensor Ô¨Åeld are formed from
the ordinary derivatives (along the basic vector Ô¨Åelds) of its components (see (3.2)
and the Ô¨Årst term in (3.3)) and a ‚Äòcorrection‚Äô which is linear in them (see (3.2)
and the sums in (3.3)), we may pose a problem for choosing a local frame so that
this ‚Äòcorrection‚Äô to vanish. Since a vector Ô¨Åeld along it‚Äôs integral paths can be re-
place by the integral paths‚Äô tangent vectors, we, by virtue of (3.17), could expect
that such special frames may, possibly, exist along C1 paths. We would like the
above ‚Äòcorrection‚Äô to vanish for all C1 tensor Ô¨Åelds of arbitrary type. Due to (3.2)
and (3.3), this is equivalent to the demand the (local) coeÔ¨Écients of the linear
connection to vanish in the mentioned special kind of frames. Thus we have come
to the following deÔ¨Ånition.
DeÔ¨Ånition 5.1. Given a linear connection ‚àáon a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold M and
a subset U ‚äÜM. A frame {Ei}, deÔ¨Åne on an open subset of M containing U
10The extremals are deÔ¨Åned as paths for which some functional on the space of paths connecting
two Ô¨Åxed points is stationary; for details see, e.g., [12, p. 309Ô¨Ä] or [24, p. 48Ô¨Ä].

everywhere on U. Respectively, {Ei} is called normal for ‚àáalong g: Q ‚ÜíM, Q
being non-empty set, if it is normal for ‚àáon g(Q).
We can rephrase the Ô¨Årst part of this deÔ¨Ånition by writing

which looks exactly like a directional derivative (along X) in Rn. Just in this
sense one can say that the linear connections and covariant derivatives are locally
Euclidean but this is not quite rigorous because, at this point, we still do not know
anything on the existence of normal frames. That problem will be investigated at
length further in the present monograph.
By virtue of (3.1), the equalities Œìi
jk|U = 0, i, j, k = 1, . . . , dim M, on a
neighborhood U are equivalent to (‚àáXEi)|U = 0 for every X ‚ààX(M), i.e., the
basic vector Ô¨Åelds Ei must be parallel on U (see DeÔ¨Ånition 3.3). Thus we have
proved the following simple result.
Proposition 5.1. A frame is normal on a neighborhood U in M iÔ¨Äit is paral-
lel on U.
Therefore the concepts ‚Äòparallel frame‚Äô and ‚Äònormal frame‚Äô are equivalent on
neighborhoods.
Example 5.1. A frame normal for a linear connection on a neighborhood U on
which the connection is Ô¨Çat is provided by a frame obtained from a basis at a
Ô¨Åxed point in U by its parallel transportation to the other points in U along paths
lying in U.
We want to emphasize on the fact that a frame {Ei} normal for ‚àáon a set
U ‚äÜM is always supposed to be deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood U containing or equal
to U, U ‚äáU, and the equality U = U is admissible if U is itself a neighborhood.
This is quite essential assumption as the property of {Ei} to be normal at p for
‚àáfor every p ‚ààU depends on the properties of {Ei} and ‚àáin a neighborhood of
p, not only at p. (See, e.g., equation (5.4) below in which the action of Ei on A
appears which is not deÔ¨Åned if A is not given on a neighborhood of each p ‚ààU.)
Let {Ei} be a frame on U ‚äÜM. On U exists a normal frame {E‚Ä≤
i} iÔ¨Äthere is a
C1 matrix-valued function A := [Aj
i] transforming {Ei} into {E‚Ä≤

i = Aj
iEj, and
such that in {E‚Ä≤
i} the coeÔ¨Écients on ‚àáare Œì‚Ä≤ i
jk = 0 which is a system of partial
diÔ¨Äerential equations with respect to A. To write it in a compact form, as well as for
saving writing and for purposes that will be clear in the next chapters, we introduce
the matrices of the connection coeÔ¨Écients Œìk :=

Œìi

The above considerations show that normal frames {E‚Ä≤
i} exist on a set U
if and only if the system (5.4) has solutions in some (and hence in any) frame
{Ei}. Besides, if such solutions exist, their properties are completely responsible
for the properties of the frames normal on U. Moreover, to any solution A of (5.4)
there corresponds a unique frame normal on U and v. v., i.e., there is a bijective
correspondence between the solutions of (5.4) and the frames normal on U. For
these reasons, the equation (5.4) is called the equation of the normal (on U) frames
or simply the normal frame equation.
To the problems of existence and uniqueness of the solutions of (5.4) for
linear connections is devoted Chapter II. It contains a complete description of all
frames and coordinates normal at a point, along path, or on submanifolds (if such
exist at all in the last case).
Now we shall prove two simple propositions, the Ô¨Årst concerning the unique-
ness of normal frames while the second one reveals the role of the torsion for the
existence of normal coordinates (see below DeÔ¨Ånition 5.2).
Proposition 5.2. Let a linear connection admits a frame normal on U ‚äÜM. The
set of all frames normal for this connection on U consists of all frames that can be
obtained from a Ô¨Åxed normal frame by means of linear transformations whose ma-
trices vanish on U under the action of the basic vector Ô¨Åelds of the normal frames.
Proof. Let {Ei} be a frame normal on U, i.e., Œìl = 0 and {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej} be a
frame on U. By (5.3), in {E‚Ä≤
i} the matrices of the connection‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écients are
Œì‚Ä≤
k = Al
kA‚àí1El(A), A = [Aj
i ]. Hence, Œì‚Ä≤
k|U = 0 iÔ¨ÄEl(A)|U = 0.
‚ñ°
Let us mention the following evident consequence of this proposition (or of
its proof).
Corollary 5.1. All frames normal on U for a linear connection, if any, are con-
nected via linear transformations whose coeÔ¨Écients vanish on U under the action
of the basic vector Ô¨Åelds of the normal frames.
Proposition 5.3. Let a linear connection admits frames normal on some neigh-
borhood U ‚äÜM. All of these frames are either holonomic or anholonomic on U
depending on is the torsion of the connection zero or non-zero on U respectively.
1When writing the elements of a matrix A in the form Aj
i (or Aj
i, or A j
i ), we consider the
superscript as a Ô¨Årst index and the subscript as a second index (see the list of conventions,
page xii). So, the product of A and B is AB = [Ai
jBj
k] if A = [Aj
i] and B = [Bj
i ].

Proof. Suppose {Ei} is a normal frame on U. In it, by (3.14), the torsion‚Äôs
components are T i

‚ñ°
Remark 5.1. The holonomicity of the frames normal on U ‚äÜM does not imply
any conclusions for their holonomicity outside U if U Ã∏= M and the frames are
deÔ¨Åned on a larger set V ‚äÉU, V ‚äÜM. Moreover, on V \U the frames (normal
on U, but not on V \U) can be either holonomic or anholonomic (or both on
diÔ¨Äerent subsets of V \U). In fact, let {Ei} be a frame deÔ¨Åned on V ‚äÜM which
is normal on U ‚äÇV and A = [Aj
i] be non-degenerate matrix-valued function on
V . According to (3.5), in the frame {E‚Ä≤
i := Aj

on U are Œì‚Ä≤ i

|U = 0 which do not imply any restrictions on A (or
on {E‚Ä≤
i}) on the set V \U. Hence, choosing appropriately A on V \U, we can force
{E‚Ä≤
i}, which is normal on U, on the set V \U, i.e., outside U, to be holonomic as
well as anholonomic depending on the properties of A on V \U.
Remark 5.2. Proposition 5.3 has the following generalization. Call a frame {Ei},
deÔ¨Åne on a neighborhood containing or equal to U ‚äÜM, commuting on U if
[Ej, Ek] |U = 0. (If U is a neighborhood, a frame commuting on U is holonomic
on U and vice versa.) Then a frame normal for a connection ‚àáis commuting on U
iÔ¨Ä‚àáis torsion free on U. (The proof is identical with the one of Proposition 5.3.)
This result will not be used further as the commutativity of {Ei} on U does not,
generally, imply some assertions concerning the holonomicity of {Ei} on U.
Remark 5.3. If U is not a neighborhood, from the relation [Ej, Ek] |U = 0, gen-
erally, does not follow the holonomicity of the frame {Ei} on U as, by deÔ¨Ånition,
this is a property deÔ¨Åned on neighborhoods.
In particular, Proposition 5.3 means that only the symmetric, i.e., torsion-
less, linear connections may admit holonomic frames normal on a neighborhood
and, consequently, normal coordinates. Moreover, these connections do not admit
anholonomic normal frames.
DeÔ¨Ånition 5.2. Given a linear connection ‚àáon a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold M. A chart
(V, x) of M and the associated to it coordinate system {xi} are called normal on
a subset U ‚äÜV for ‚àáif the coordinate frame

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

is normal on U for ‚àá.
Rewording, normal coordinates are those the associated to which local frames
are normal. A trivial consequence of DeÔ¨Ånition 5.2 and Propositions 5.2 and 5.3
is the following result.
Corollary 5.2. Coordinates normal on a neighborhood may exist only for torsion
free linear connections and they generate all normal frames for them, if such exist
at all.

5. Normal frames: General ideas and uniqueness
41
Remark 5.4. The theorem what spaces (with linear connection) admit normal co-
ordinates (at a Ô¨Åxed point), which is a special case of Proposition 5.3 and Corol-
lary 5.2, dates back to the Ô¨Årst third of the twentieth century; see [43,44].
We can also paraphrase the above in the assertion that the linear connections
with non-vanishing torsion do not admit holonomic frames normal on a neighbor-
hood and, consequently, coordinates normal for them do not exist; if for them
normal frames exist, these frames are anholonomic with necessity.
For future purposes, we reformulate equation (5.4) in terms of local coor-
dinates. Let U ‚äÜM, and {xi} be local coordinates associated with a chart
(V, x) such that V ‚à©U Ã∏= ‚àÖ. Then, due to (3.6), the deÔ¨Åned on V coordinates
x‚Ä≤ i = x‚Ä≤ i(x1, . . . , xdim M) are normal on U ‚à©V iÔ¨Ä

(5.4‚Ä≤)
Hence, normal coordinates exist iÔ¨Äthe last equation has solution(s) with respect to
{x‚Ä≤ i} provided {xi} is given. Obviously, (5.4‚Ä≤) is a special case of (5.4) for Ei =

‚àÇxi ,
E‚Ä≤
i =

‚àÇx‚Ä≤ i , and U replaced with U ‚à©V , the last reÔ¨Çecting the local character of
the coordinates. We call (5.4‚Ä≤) the normal coordinates equation or the (system of )
equation(s) of normal coordinates. Thus we see that the normal coordinates can
be found by solving a second order system of partial diÔ¨Äerential equations while
the analogous system for the normal frames is of Ô¨Årst order. Correspondingly, if
we are interested only in normal frames, the smoothness class of the connection
admitting them is generally with one less then the one required for the existence
of normal coordinates.
If the subset U ‚äÜM is not a neighborhood, results slightly weaker than
Proposition 5.3 and Corollary 5.2 hold:
Proposition 5.4. If a linear connection ‚àáadmits coordinates normal on a set U,
it is torsionless on U. Said diÔ¨Äerently, if ‚àáadmits frame normal and holonomic
on U, it is torsion free on U.
Proof. If q ‚ààU and (V, x) with V ‚àãq is a normal chart on U for ‚àá, equa-
tion (5.4) holds and, taking its antisymmetric part with respect to j and k, we get
Œìi
[mn]|U‚à©V = 0. Since

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

is a holonomic frame, Ci
jk = 0, the last equality is
equivalent to T i
jk|U‚à©V = 0 (see (3.14)). Hence T i
jk(q) = 0 for every q ‚ààU, i.e., ‚àá
is torsion free on U.
‚ñ°
Corollary 5.3. Normal coordinates and holonomic normal frames may exist on
U ‚äÜM only for linear connections which are torsionless on U.
Proof. See Proposition 5.4.
‚ñ°
Further, we shall see that if frames normal on a submanifold exist, the van-
ishment of the torsion is also a suÔ¨Écient conditions for the existence of normal
coordinates.

42
Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
Just in the above arguments we see the reasons, why in the majority of the
literature only the case of normal coordinates for torsionless (symmetric) linear
connections is investigated.
Let {Ei} be a frame normal on U, deÔ¨Åned on larger set V ‚äÉU, V ‚äÜM,
and not normal on V \U Ã∏= ‚àÖ. In such a case it should be clearly understood that
the connection coeÔ¨Écients in {Ei} vanish solely on U and generally are non-zero
on V \U. This implies the non-vanishment of the derivatives Œìi


, etc., if they exist, i.e., some of the partial derivatives
of the connection‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écients may vanish on U but not all of them. If dim U =
dim M, the equalities Œìi
jk|U = 0, due to (3.13), imply R|U = 0, i.e., the Ô¨Çatness of
the connection on U. Therefore on a neighborhood of M normal frames may exist
if on it the connection is Ô¨Çat; in Section II.4 we shall see that this condition is also
suÔ¨Écient. By virtue of the above remarks, the normal frames, if any, can sometimes
be used to simplify certain calculations. For instance, in a normal frame the com-
ponents of curvature and torsion are (in the domain where the frame is normal):
Ri
jkl = ‚àí2Œìi
j[k,l]
T i
jk = ‚àíCi
jk.
Now, let us see what happens with the parallel transport in a set U ‚äÜM
admitting a normal frame {Ei}. In it, due to (3.17), the parallel transport initial-
value problem (3.18) reads
d
dsKi1...ir‚Ä≤
j1...jr (Œ≥(s)) = 0,
Ki1...ir‚Ä≤
j1...jr (Œ≥(s0)) = K0
i1...ir‚Ä≤
j1...jr
(5.5)
and hence Ki1...ir‚Ä≤
j1...jr (Œ≥(s)) = K0
i1...ir‚Ä≤
j1...jr = const. This implies an interesting conclu-
sion: the parallel transport along paths lying entirely in the domain of a normal
frame preserves the tensors‚Äô components in such a frames. A trivial, but impor-
tant, corollary from here is the following result.
Proposition 5.5. If on a subset U ‚äÜM exist normal frames, then the parallel
transport between every two points in U is independent of the path along with it is
performed provided this path lies entirely in U.
So, in a normal frame the parallel transport looks exactly as the ‚Äòparallel
transport‚Äô in Rn which preserves the vectors‚Äô components while it changes only
the points at which they are ‚Äòattached‚Äô. This rigorous result is the strict meaning of
the assertion that ‚Äòlocally the parallel transport is Euclidean‚Äô. Here the problem
what exactly ‚Äòlocally‚Äô means is open. Strictly speaking, by ‚Äòlocally‚Äô one should
understand a set on which normal frames or coordinates exist.
The assertion inverse to Proposition 5.5 is (locally) valid if U is a submani-
fold. This is important and highly untrivial result that will be proved in Subsec-
tion II.5.2 (see Corollary II.5.1 on page 123).
Proposition 5.6. If frames normal on U ‚äÜM exist, then all of them are parallel
on the set U.

5. Normal frames: General ideas and uniqueness
43
Proof. Let the frame {Ei} be normal on a set U and X = XiEi ‚ààX(U). Ap-
plying condition (ii) of DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1, (3.1), and (5.1), we obtain (‚àáXEj)|U =
(Xk‚àáEkEj)|U = Xk|U

Œìi
jk|U

Ei|U = 0. So, according to DeÔ¨Ånition 3.4, the frame
{Ei} is parallel on U.
‚ñ°
The statement inverse to Proposition 5.6 is partially valid provided U is a
submanifold of M: if on U exist parallel frames (with respect to paths in U), it
admits also normal ones but, generally, not all parallel on U frames are normal.
This essential assertion will be proved in Subsection II.5.2 (see Corollary II.5.2 on
page 123). From more general positions, the links between parallel transports and
normal frames will be studied in Chapter IV.
Running a few steps forward, we want brieÔ¨Çy to stress on the importance
of the normal frames for the physics. Above we saw that in a normal frame the
mathematical structures related to a linear connection look like the ones in Rn (or
in the Euclidean space En). Similar situation is observed in the theoretical physics:
the consideration of a physical phenomenon in a suitable reference frame, usually
called inertial, makes it looking like a ‚Äòfree‚Äô one, i.e., as in the absence of forces.2
The analogy between normal frames and frames of reference is most obvious in
the general theory of relativity: in it the gravitational Ô¨Åeld strength is (locally)
described via the coeÔ¨Écients of some Riemannian linear connection, so the gravity
force (locally) ‚Äòdisappears‚Äô in a frame normal for this connection and, consequently,
this frame is inertial. The same situation can be discovered in the classical physics
but it is so natural and (almost?) trivial that it is practically nowhere mentioned
in this context. Recently it was shown that the Heisenberg picture of (nonrela-
tivistic) quantum mechanics, which is something like a ‚Äòquantum mechanics in
an inertial frame‚Äô, is identical to the representation of this theory in Schr¬®odinger
in an appropriate normal frame (in a Hilbert bundle ‚Äì see Section IV.16 below).
These and other examples push forward the idea of identifying the mathematical
concept ‚Äònormal frame‚Äô with the physical concept ‚Äòinertial frame (of reference)‚Äô.
Generally, in the identiÔ¨Åcation
normal frame ‚â°inertial frame
we see the reason why the manifolds with linear connection Ô¨Ånd a broad application
in a lot of fundamental physical theories. The above explains why the investigation
of the normal frames is essential for the theoretical physics, not only for pure
mathematical purposes.
2A simple, but typical, example is the representation of the Klein-Gordon equation in normal
coordinates which leads to the decomposition of the initial scalar Ô¨Åeld as a sum of independent
harmonic oscillators [45, Chapter XXI, ¬ß 2]. A role similar to the normal coordinates play the nor-
mal modes or, more generally, normal waves in some linear dynamical systems [46, pp. 360‚Äì362].

(6.2)
Proof. If {xi} are normal on U, then Œìi
jk|U = 0 by deÔ¨Ånition and, from equa-
tion (4.16), we get gij,k(x) = 0, x ‚ààU. Conversely, if (6.2) holds, equation (6.1)
implies Œìi
jk|U = 0.
‚ñ°
Therefore the normal coordinates on a Riemannian manifold can be deÔ¨Åned
as ones in which the partial derivatives of the components of the Riemannian
metric vanish. Notice, equation (6.2) generally does not imply the vanishment of
(all of) the second derivatives of the metric‚Äôs components on U.
Regardless that nowadays we have at our disposal reÔ¨Åne and powerful meth-
ods for proving the existence and construction of normal frames/coodinates on
spaces far more general than the Riemannian ones, considered in the next chap-
ters, below we present, following [24, pp. 51‚Äì57], possibly the Ô¨Årst known such
method which goes back to B. Riemann in 1854 [19, 24, resp. p. 155 and p. 53].
Besides from historical positions, this method is interesting due to the fact that, at
least at a level of ideas, it is explicitly or implicitly presented as a part or underling
background of some of the modern methods in that Ô¨Åeld.
Let M be a C‚àûmanifold endowed with a C‚àûRiemannian metric g. Take an
arbitrary point p ‚ààM and let {xi} be local coordinate system in a neighborhood
U ‚Ä≤ ‚àãp. Consider on some subneighborhood U ‚àãp of U ‚Ä≤ the unique geodesic
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM passing through p, Œ≥(s0) = p for some s0 ‚ààJ, in the direction of
arbitrarily chosen vector X ‚ààTp(M), ÀôŒ≥(s0) = X. This geodesic is necessarily of
class C‚àû(see Section 4) and we can expand Œ≥i(s), s ‚ààJ in a power series with
respect to s ‚àís0:

is homeomorphism (between
1-dimensional manifolds). These coordinates can be extended in a whole neighbor-
hood of p. Let V (p) be a normal neighborhood of p (see DeÔ¨Ånition 3.6 and Propo-
sition 3.1). Since U ‚à©V (p) is, evidently, normal neighborhood, every q ‚ààU ‚à©V (p)
can be connected with p with a unique geodesic, say Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU ‚à©V (p), lying en-
tirely in U ‚à©V (p) [38, p. 385], [11, Chapter IV, Proposition 3.4]. So, there exist
unique s0, s ‚ààJ such that Œ≥(s0) = p and Œ≥(s) = q. In U ‚à©V (p) we deÔ¨Åne a
coordinate system {yi} such that
yi(q) := ÀôŒ≥i(s0)(s ‚àís0).
(6.8)
In particular yi(p) = 0. By virtue of (6.4), the link between {xi} and {yi} in

The just introduced coordinates {yi} are known as Riemannian coordinates
with origin (pole) p.1 Their domain coincides with that for which the series (6.9)
may be inverted or, equivalently, it is a neighborhood of p in which no two geodesics
through p meet again in it. The above results can be formulate as the following
assertion.
Proposition 6.2. For every point of a C‚àûRiemannian manifold with C‚àûmet-
ric there exists its normal neighborhood in which Riemannian coordinates can be
introduces.
Evidently, the equation (6.7) is nothing else but the equation of the unique

equation (4.17) looks exactly as the equation of the straight lines in Rn. Denoting
the ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols with respect to {yi} with

in the domain of {yi}. On the opposite, if these equations hold, {yi} are Rieman-

The following proposition expresses the most important for us result of this
section.

The Riemannian coordinates are ‚Äòmore than normal‚Äô at their origin, viz. at
it vanish not only the ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols, but also all of the quantities (6.5) and

Here the left superscript y indicates that the corresponding quantities are com-
puted in {yi}. The equalities (6.11a) follow from (6.9) if we put in them xi = yi
(the initial choice of {xi} is completely arbitrary) and take into account the sym-
metry of Œìi
i1...in+1 in the subscripts. The other equations, (6.11b) and (6.11c), are
consequence of (6.11a) and (6.5). So, at the origin of the Riemannian coordinates
vanish the ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols together with their symmetrized derivatives of all
orders.
If we (C‚àû) change the initial local coordinates {xi}, {xi} ‚Üí{x‚Ä≤ i}, then, due
to (6.8) and (6.9), this results in the change of the Riemannian coordinates with
a constant matrix:

with ai

analytic change {xi} ‚Üí{x‚Ä≤ i} which is, of course, not unique.
If {yi} are Riemannian coordinates with origin at some p ‚ààM in a neighbor-
hood U ‚àãp, the holonomic frame {‚àÇ/‚àÇyi} on U is normal at p. As we know from
Proposition 5.2, all other frames {Ei} normal at p are given by Ei = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇyj on U
where the non-degenerate matrix-valued function A = [Aj
i] is such that ‚àÇA
‚àÇyi |p = 0.
According to Proposition 5.3, these frames are holonomic at p, [Ei, Ej] |p = 0, but
outside p they need not to be such, i.e., generally [Ei, Ej] |q Ã∏= 0 for q ‚ààU\{p}
(see Remark 5.1 on page 40).
In this way we have obtained a complete description of the frames normal at
a single point of a C‚àûRiemannian manifold.2
According to [19, pp. 155, 158] and [24, p. 53] normal coordinates (in a sense
of Riemannian ones) ware Ô¨Årst introduce by B. Riemann in 1854 [48].
Let {yi} be Riemannian coordinates with origin at p ‚ààM. Since [gy
ij(p)] is
a constant symmetric non-degenerate matrix, it can be diagonalized via trans-
formation of the form A[gy
ij(p)]A‚ä§with constant orthogonal matrix A = [aj
i],
A‚ä§= A‚àí1, A‚ä§being the transposed to A matrix [49, Chapter 4, ¬ß 7]. So we can
deÔ¨Åne new Riemannian coordinates y‚Ä≤ i = ai
jyj in which [gy‚Ä≤
ij (p)] = A[gy
ij(p)]A‚ä§=
diag(Œµ1, . . . , Œµdim M) where Œµi = ¬±1 and diag(a1, . . . , an) means a diagonal matrix
with diagonal elements a1, . . . , an. These particular Riemannian coordinates were
2At the moment this description is implicit. The explicit formula for the matrix A transforming
{‚àÇ/‚àÇyi} to arbitrary normal frame will be derived in Subsection II.2.2; see Theorem II.2.3.

Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
Ô¨Årst introduced by G.D. BirkhoÔ¨Äin 1923 [50] under the name ‚Äònormal coordi-
nates‚Äô (see [19, p. 155] and [24, p. 55]). The associated to these coordinates frame
{‚àÇ/‚àÇyi} is such that at p it is orthonormal, g(‚àÇ/‚àÇyi, ‚àÇ/‚àÇyj)|p = ¬±Œ¥ij, and at the
same time it is normal, ‚àá‚àÇ/‚àÇyi(‚àÇ/‚àÇyj)|p = 0 (see [11, Chapter IV, ¬ß 3]). Nowadays
these special Riemannian coordinates are constructed by means of the exponential
mapping; see the end of Subsection II.2.3 and [8].
Besides the Riemannian coordinates, there are also other classes of coor-
dinates normal at a single point. Their complete description on a manifold with
arbitrary symmetric linear connection will be given in Subsection II.2.2. An exam-
ple of such coordinates are the geodesic coordinates.3 If {xi} are local coordinates
in a neighborhood U of p ‚ààM, the geodesic coordinates {zi} with origin at p of a
point q belonging to some subneighborhood of U, are given via the series [24, p. 56]

where ci
i1...in = ci
(i1...in) ‚ààR and zi(p) := 0. Analogously to (6.9), it is convergent
and invertible with respect to zi(q) in some neighborhood of p.
Repeating the proof of Proposition 6.3, we see that the geodesic coordinates
are normal at their origin p,

p = 0. In them the equation of the geodesics
through the origin reads (see (6.4))

with p = Œ≥(s0), X = ÀôŒ≥(s0), and the Œì‚Äôs being deÔ¨Åned by (6.5). Hence the Rieman-
nian coordinates are geodesic ones in which the Œì‚Äôs vanish at the origin (cf. (6.11)).
A number of examples of coordinates/frames normal for Riemannian connec-
tions will be presented below in Section 7. Instances of some applications of the
Riemannian and geodesic coordinates can be found in [19,24,51].
At this point a natural question arises: are there subsets of a Riemannian
manifold, diÔ¨Äerent from single points, on which normal coordinates/frames exist?
The Ô¨Årst result in this Ô¨Åeld was obtained by E. Fermi in 1922 [52]: a coordinate
system can be chosen so that in it the partial derivatives of the components of
the metric tensor vanish along a given smooth path without self-intersections (see
also [53,54]). Now the Fermi‚Äôs proof of this theorem is only of historical interest and
we are not going to reproduce it here. Further, in Section II.3, we will establish an
analogous result for arbitrary linear connections from which the above assertion is
an evident special case (see, in particular, Proposition II.3.2 and Corollary II.3.1).
3In [51] the geodesic coordinates are deÔ¨Åned as ones in which the partial derivatives of the
metric vanish at a given point. By Proposition 6.1, the concepts ‚Äògeodesic coordinates‚Äô in Fock‚Äôs
sense and ‚Äònormal coordinates‚Äô in our sense are synonyms.

7. Examples of normal coordinates
49
Till 1958 the problem for existence of normal coordinates/frames on sets
other than points and curves (without self-intersections) in a general Riemannian
manifold, as well as for other manifolds with linear connection, was open. In 1958
O‚ÄôRaifeartaigh [55] proved a general theorem concerning the existence of normal
frames on arbitrary submanifolds of manifolds with symmetric, i.e., torsionless,
linear connection. This result will be reviewed in Section II.5. When applied to
the above problem, it asserts that the points and curves are the only submanifolds
of a Riemannian manifold on which normal coordinates/frames always exists. Only
special types of Riemannian connections admit frames normal on other submani-
folds; in particular, coordinates/frames normal on the whole manifold or its open
subset (neighborhood) exist iÔ¨Äthe connection is Ô¨Çat on it.
7.
Examples of normal coordinates for
Riemannian connections
The purpose of this section is to exemplify the general theory of Sections 5 and 6
on manifolds endowed with Riemannian connections generated by Riemannian
metrics. The section contains also several exercises.
Most of the examples presented below will follow the following scheme. Let
M be a submanifold of RN for some N ‚ààN 1 and f : RN √ó RN ‚ÜíR be a scalar
product (see, e.g., (7.1) and (7.16) below) which induces a Riemannian metric ¬Øf
on T (RN); one usually identiÔ¨Åes f and ¬Øf as T (RN) and RN are isomorphic vector
spaces. Suppose g is the Riemannian metric on M induced (generated) by ¬Øf, viz.
g = ¬Øf|M is the restriction of ¬Øf to M.2 Then the metric g induces on M a Rieman-
nian connection ‚àáas described in Section 4 (see, in particular, equations (4.13)
and (4.14)). We shall calculate the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáin concrete coordinate systems
and will look for subsets of M on which these systems are normal for ‚àá. Besides,
some constructions of geodesic coordinates will be pointed out.
Suppose the manifold under consideration has some symmetry and the coor-
dinates/frames on it are chosen in a way that ‚ÄòreÔ¨Çects‚Äô this symmetry. As we shall
see below, in such a situation it is ‚Äòquite likely‚Äô that these coordinates/frames
may happen to be normal on some (‚Äònatural‚Äô for the symmetry) subset for the
connection induced on the manifold by a Riemannian metric which, in its turn, is
generated by the Euclidean metric of some Rn for some n ‚ààN in which the initial
manifold is embedded.
1Recall the Whitney embedding theorem [56, p. 44, Theorem 1.9.12]: every C2 n-dimensional
manifold can be embedded in R2n, i.e., can be considered as a submanifold of RN for some
N ‚ààN; see also [56, p. 119, Remark 3.2.9].
2The easiest way to Ô¨Ånd g explicitly is to use diÔ¨Äerential forms. Let d denotes the exterior
derivative operator and ‚àßis the wedge (exterior) product sign. If ¬Øf = fijdxi ‚àßdxj in some
coordinate system {xi} on RN, then g = fij|Mdxi|M ‚àßdxj|M and it is quite convenient to use
as a coordinate system on M the restricted coordinate system {xi|M}, which agrees with the
deÔ¨Ånition of a submanifold given on page 7.

The main conclusion from the above is that for any point in one-dimensional
Riemannian space there exists local coordinates in some its neighborhood which
coordinates are normal on their domain for the Riemannian connection induced
via the initial Riemannian metric. Since the curvature tensor identically vanishes
for a C1 connection on C3 1-manifold (see (3.11) and (3.13)), this result is also
a consequence of Theorem II.4.1, presented below on page 104, in a case of a C2
metric on a C3 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold.5
Example 7.3 (The two-sphere S2). Let S2 := {(v1, v2, v3) ‚ààR3 : (v1)2 + (v2)2 +
(v3)2 = r2} be a two-dimensional sphere of radius r ‚ààR, r > 0, in R3. Let on S2
minus one point (e.g., the ‚ÄòNorth pole‚Äô) be given the standard spherical coordinates
(Œ∏, œï), with range (0, œÄ] √ó [0, 2œÄ), obtained from the spherical coordinates in R3
via restriction to S2 (see equations (7.12) below or/and [57, Section 3.1-6]).

2 and œï ‚ó¶Œ≥ = id[0,2œÄ), i.e., they are normal on the great circle obtained by

explicit form of A will be presented in Example II.6.2 below; for details concerning
frames/coordinates normal along paths for linear connections, see Section II.3 in
the Chapter II.
Due to the symmetry of the sphere S2, it is clear that for any great circle
on it there exist (local) coordinates on S2 which are normal on this circle for the
Riemannian connection on S2 generated by the metric g (induced from R3).
Example 7.4 (The spheres Sn for any n ‚ààN). The circle S1 := {(v1, v2) ‚ààR2 :
(v1)2 + (v2)2 = r2} of radius r ‚ààR, r > 0, is a 1-dimensional manifold. The polar
coordinate function œï, with range [0, 2œÄ) and induced from polar coordinates in R2,
provides a coordinate function on a subset V equal to S1 without some arbitrarily
Ô¨Åxed point. The standard Euclidean metric on E2 induces on S1 a metric g whose
only component in {x1 = œï} is g11 = r2 = const. Hence the metric g generates
on S2 a Riemannian connection ‚àáwhose only coeÔ¨Écient in {x1} is Œì1
11|V = 0.
Consequently, the polar coordinate system {x1 = œï} on S2 is normal for ‚àáon
V . This result agrees with the results of Examples 7.1 (g is a ‚Äòconstant‚Äô metric in
{x1}) and 7.2 (S1 is a one-dimensional manifold).
Consider now the general case of an n-dimensional, n ‚â•2, sphere Sn in Rn+1
of radius r > 0, viz.
Sn := {(v1, . . . , vn) ‚ààRn+1 : (v1)2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (vn)2 = r2}.
Let (R, Œ∏n‚àí1, . . . , Œ∏1, œï) be the (hyper-)spherical coordinates in Rn+1; the range of
R is (0, ‚àû), the one of Œ∏n‚àí1, . . . , Œ∏1 is (0, œÄ] and œï takes values in [0, 2œÄ). They
are connected with the standard coordinate system {u1, . . . , un+1} in Rn+1 by the

The equation of Sn in these coordinates is R2 = r2 or R = r (as r > 0 and R takes
non-negative values). The functions
{x1 = Œ∏n‚àí1, x2 = Œ∏n‚àí2, . . . , xn‚àí1 = Œ∏1, xn = œï}
(7.13)
provide an internal coordinates system on Sn (without one point) in which the
metric g induced on Sn from En has components gij, i, j = 1, . . . , n, such that
(2 ‚â§k ‚â§n ‚àí1)
[gij] = diag(r2, r2 sin2 x1, . . . , r2 sin2 x1 . . . sin2 xk‚àí1, . . . , r2 sin2 x1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ sin2 xn‚àí1).
(7.14)
The metric g induces on Sn a Riemannian metric ‚àá. Using equations (4.15)
and (4.13), we can calculate that ‚àáhas the following non-vanishing coeÔ¨Écients in
the coordinate system (7.13) (do not sum over i and k!):

for n = 2 (resp. for n = 3) are given by (7.11) (resp. by (7.43) below).
Let Œ≥ : [0, 2œÄ) ‚ÜíSn be a path in Sn such that xi ‚ó¶Œ≥ = œÄ

It is clear, if C is a circle on Sn obtained by intersecting Sn by a 2-plane
through its origin, then there are coordinates on Sn normal along C for the Rie-
mannian connection considered above; this is a consequence of the afore-presented
material in which u1 and u2 should be standard coordinates in the 2-plane to
which C belongs.
The case of S2, investigated in Example 7.3, corresponds to the choice n = 2.
Example 7.5 (The pseudospheres Sn
q ). The Euclidean space Rn
q :=Rn
p,q :=(Rn,en
q )
of index q,where p, q ‚ààN ‚à™{0} and p + q = n ‚ààN, consists of the space Rn
endowed with a scalar product (metric) (of index q) en
q := en
p,q such that

b=p+1

(7.16)
for v = (v1, . . . , vn) ‚ààRn and w = (w1, . . . , wn) ‚ààRn.6
Special cases of the spaces Rn
q are well know in physics. For instance, the
(Lorentzian) space R5
4 = R4
4 √ó R and the spherical space S3 ‚äÇR4 of (special)
radius R Ô¨Ånd application in the geometrical interpretation of the Einstein model
of the Universe [58, ¬ß 138] (see also Example 7.9 below). However, the most famous
example is the Minkowski spacetime M4 := R4
3 (or the isomorphic to it space R4
1)
on which the special theory of relativity and the whole relativistic physics rests;
for instance, see [20,21,51,59‚Äì64].
The pseudosphere (pseudo-Riemannian spherical manifold) Sn
q of index q,
with n ‚â•1 and 0 ‚â§q ‚â§n, of radius r ‚ààR, r > 0, in Rn+1
q
is deÔ¨Åned by [39,
Section 2.4], [27, Chapter 1, ¬ß 4]
Sn
q := {v ‚ààRn+1
q
: en+1
q
(v, v) = r2}.
It is a Cœâ 2-connected manifold. Since the pseudospheres reduce in the case q = 0
to ordinary spheres, Sn
0 = Sn, investigated in Example 7.4, further we shall suppose
that q ‚â•1. Since the pseudosphere S1
1 is a 2-connected 1-dimensional manifold,
which case is covered by Example 7.2, we shall suppose below n ‚â•2.7
By g below will be denoted the Riemannian metric on Sn
q induced by the
metric en+1
q
, g = en+1
q
|Sn
q . Respectively, by ‚àáwill be denoted the Riemannian
connection on Sn
q generated by g as described in Section 4.
6By replacing e and ¬Øe in (7.2) by en
q and ¬Øeq, respectively, we obtain a Riemannian (pseudo-
Euclidean) metric ¬Øeq of index q on Rn induced by en
q ; for evident reasons, one usually writes en
q
for ¬Øen
q .
7Example 7.1 is also applicable in the concrete case. BrieÔ¨Çy this can be shown as follows. On
R2
1 can be introduced pseudospherical coordinates (œÅ, œá), with respective ranges R \ {0} and R,
connected with the standard coordinates (u1, u2) on R2 by
u1 = œÅ cosh œá
u2 = œÅ sinh œá.
(7.17)
In them S1
1 = {v ‚ààR2
1 : œÅ(v) = ¬±r}. The function œá provides a coordinate system {œá} with
domain {v ‚ààR2
1 : œÅ(v) = +r} or {v ‚ààR2
1 : œÅ(v) = ‚àír} on S1
1. In it the metric g induced on S1
1
by e1
1 has a single component equal to r2. Hence g induces a Ô¨Çat Riemannian connection on S1
1
for which {œá} is normal on its domain. Cf. the last part of Example 7.1.

7. Examples of normal coordinates

Let n ‚â•2, q ‚â•1 and p := n ‚àíq ‚â•1; hence q ‚â§n ‚àí1. Then in Rn+1
q
can be
introduced pseudospherical coordinates
(œÅ, œáq, . . . , œá1, Œ∏p‚àí1, . . . , Œ∏1, œï)

where for p = 1 the Œ∏‚Äôs and the terms containing them below should be miss-

is (0, œÄ], and œï takes values in [0, 2œÄ). The connection of the coordinates (7.18)
with the standard ones (u1, . . . , un+1) in Rn+1 (or Rn+1

(n = p + 1 + q ‚àí1)
un+1 = œÅ sinh œáq.
(7.19)
The comparison between (7.19) and (7.12) reveals that (Œ∏p, . . . , Œ∏1, œï) are
spherical coordinates on Sp ‚äÇRp+1 ‚äÇRp+1 √ó Rq
q ‚àº= Rn+1
q
,
where ‚àº= is the
‚Äòisomorphic to‚Äô sign.
Suppose now that n ‚â•2 and q ‚â•2; hence p := n‚àíq ‚â•0 and this case covers
the possibility q = n, i.e., the pseudosphere Sn
n in the Lorentz manifold Rn+1
n
.
Then in Rn+1
q
can be introduced phseudospherical coordinates
(œÅ, Œ∏p‚àí1, . . . , Œ∏1, œá, œÑq‚àí1, . . . , œÑ1, œï)
(7.20)
where for p = 1 (resp. p = 0) the Œ∏‚Äôs (resp. the Œ∏‚Äôs and œÑq‚àí1) and the terms
containing them below should be missing/deleted. The range of œÅ is R \ {0}, the
one of œá is R, the range of the Œ∏‚Äôs and œÑ‚Äôs is (0, œÄ], and œï takes values in [0, 2œÄ). The
explicit connection of these coordinates with the standard ones {u1, . . . , un+1} on

The only peculiarity here is the case q = n (‚â•2) and p = 0, when we have (see
above; for q = n = 2, the terms containing the œÑ‚Äôs should be missing/deleted):
u2 = œÅ sinh œá sin œÑq‚àí2 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ sin œÑ1 cos œï

(7.22)
The coordinates (7.20) are also a modiÔ¨Åcation of the spherical coordinates

Consider now the case n ‚â•2 and q ‚â•2 when the coordinates (7.20) are
applicable; to exclude the special case (p, q) = (0, n), one can impose the additional
restriction p ‚â•1, but this does not change the essence of the calculations and the
Ô¨Ånal results. They induce on the pseudosphere Sn
q the coordinate system
{x1 = Œ∏p‚àí1, . . . , xp‚àí1 = Œ∏1, xp = œá, xp+1 = œÑq‚àí1, . . . , xp+q‚àí1 = œÑ1, xn = œï}.

Let ‚àábe the Riemannian connection on Sn

with i, j, k Ã∏= p)

These formulae show that the pseudospherical coordinates (7.24) on Sn
q are
nowhere normal for ‚àáas coth s Ã∏= 0 for all s ‚ààR. (This result could be expected as
the coordinates employed are ‚Äòquite near‚Äô to a direct sum of two sets of spherical
coordinates, which are suitable of other kind of a symmetry.) However, on the
subset C := {v ‚ààSn
q : xi(v) = œÄ
2 for i Ã∏= p} (which is 2-connected 2-manifold), the
coordinate system {xi} is ‚Äòvery near‚Äô to a normal one as only the coeÔ¨Écients (7.26c)
of ‚àáare non-vanishing on C. For this reason, one can expect that coordinates
normal on a subset of C can be found by a suitable change of the coordinate
system {xi}.
Let us look for geodesic coordinate system {zi} on Sn
q in a neighborhood of
a point v0 ‚ààC ‚äÇSn
q . We set (see (6.13) with ci

xi(v) = xi(v0) + zi(v) ‚àí1

where v ‚ààC and zi(v0) := 0.

The equations (7.26) reduce this system of equations to:

for i < p

for i > p.
(7.27c)
Since (7.27b) is an algebraic cubic equation relative to zp(v), it has at least one
real solution that can explicitly be found (in radicals) by the known methods [57,
Section 1.8-3], [65]. Substituting this solution into (7.27a) and (7.27c), we can
obtain a geodesic coordinate system {zi} on some subset of the pseudosphere Sn
q
and which is normal at a point v0 ‚ààC := {v ‚ààSn
q : xi(v) = œÄ
2 for i Ã∏= p}.
Exercise 7.1. Let Hn

radius r ‚ààR, r > 0, and index q ‚àí1 and g be the metric on it induced by en+1

Suppose the coordinates (7.20) are deÔ¨Åned via (7.21) in which the replacements

cients of ‚àáin the coordinates (7.24). Construct geodesic coordinate system {zi}
on Hn
q‚àí1 using the results obtained and following the above considerations for Sn

We shall now return to the coordinates (7.18), deÔ¨Åned via (7.19), to study
in them coordinates normal on the pseudosphere Sn
q when n ‚â•2, q ‚â•1 and
p = n ‚àíq ‚â•1. First of all, we notice that the set of functions
{x1 = Œ∏p‚àí1, . . . , xp‚àí1 = Œ∏1, xp = œï, xp+1 = œáq, . . . , xp+q‚àí1 = œá2, xn = œá1} (7.28)
provides a coordinate system on Sn
q (precisely on any one of its two connected
components). The metric g has in these coordinates components gij forming the

Example 7.6 (The torus T2). The torus T2 of radii r1, r2 ‚ààR, r1 > 0 and r2 > 0,
in R3 is a product of two circles S1 and S1 of radii r1 > 0 and r2 > 0, respectively,
T2 = S1√óS1,8 If œï1 and œï2 are the respective polar coordinates, with range [0, 2œÄ),
on these circles, then
T2 = {(r cos œï1, r sin œï1, r2 sin œï2) ‚ààR3 : œï1, œï2 ‚àà[0, 2œÄ)}
r := r1 + (1 + cos œï2)r2.
(7.31)
The standard Euclidean metric on R3 (see Example 7.1) induces on T2 a
metric g whose components in the coordinate system {x1 = œï1, x2 = œï2} of T2
has components gij, i, j = 1, 2, forming the diagonal matrix
[gij] = diag(r2, r2

The Riemannian connection ‚àáinduced by g on T2 has the following non-vanishing

Œì1
12 = Œì1

From here immediately follows that the coordinates system {x1 = œï1, x2 = œï2}
is normal along the path Œ≥ : [0, 2œÄ) ‚ÜíT2 with x1 ‚ó¶Œ≥ = id[0,2œÄ) and x2 ‚ó¶Œ≥ = 0
(or Œ≥(s) = (r sin s, r cos s, 0)|r=r1+2r2 ‚ààT2 ‚äÇR3 with s ‚àà[0, 2œÄ)). Obviously,
Œ≥([0, 2œÄ)) is the the greater circle obtained by intersecting T2 with the so-called
equatorial plane (i.e., {(v1, v2, 0) ‚ààR2 : v1, v2 ‚ààR} in the representation we are
using).

s ‚ààJ is the path‚Äôs parameter and œÅ(s) ‚â•0 is the distance of Œ≥(s) from the axis,

S = {(œÅ(s) cos Œ±, œÅ(s) sin Œ±, z(s)) ‚ààR3 : s ‚ààJ, Œ± ‚àà[0, 2œÄ)}

where z(s) deÔ¨Ånes Œ≥ by Œ≥(s) = (œÅ(s), 0, z(s)) and Œ± is the angle of rotation; below
we shall suppose that œÅ and z are C2 functions. The functions x1 : v ‚Üíx1(v) = s
and x2 : v ‚Üíx2(v) = Œ± for v = (œÅ(s) cos Œ±, œÅ(s) sin Œ±, z(s)) provide a coordinate
system {x1, x2} on S.

Thus the coordinate system {x1, x2} is normal for ‚àáon the set
C := {v = (œÅ(s) cos Œ±, œÅ(s) sin Œ±, z(s)) ‚ààS : œÅ‚Ä≤(s) = 0, z‚Ä≤(s) Ã∏= 0 and z‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(v) = 0}
(7.37)
if it is non-empty.
For instance, {x1, x2} is normal on the whole surface of revolution S if, and
only if, it is a cylinder deÔ¨Åned via œÅ(s) = c and z(s) = as + b for some a, b, c ‚ààR
with a Ã∏= 0 and c Ã∏= 0. This result can be expected from the considerations in
Example 7.1.
However, the set (7.37) may turn to be the empty set in which case the
coordinates {x1, x2} are nowhere normal on S for ‚àá. Examples of surfaces of
revolution on which this happens are provided by the choices œÅ(s) = es, s3 + s
and/or z(s) = es.
Exercise 7.3. Construct explicitly geodesic coordinates system {z1, z2} with ci
... =
0 (see (6.13)) from {x1, x2} such that {z1, z2} is normal for ‚àáat an arbitrarily
chosen point v0 ‚ààS. (This construction is completely independent from is the
set (7.37) empty or non-empty.)
Exercise 7.4. Obtain the results of Example 7.3 from the above ones. Hint: a
sphere can be obtained by rotating a semi-circle around the axis passing through
its ends.
Example 7.8 (Geodesic coordinates in Schwarzschild spacetime). The manifold of
Schwarzschild is a 4-dimensional (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold endowed with a
Riemannian connection ‚àáinduced by the Schwarzschild metric g which in suitably

The coordinate system {xi} is not normal at all points of the Schwarzschild

The latter equation is a cubic algebraic equation relative to z2(q) and hence it
has at least one real solution that can be found by the known methods [57,65,69].
Substituting this solution into the former equation, one obtains an equation for
only z1(q) which has at least one real solution z1 (proof this!). Substituting this last
function into the previous expressions for z2, z3 and z4, one derives the required
geodesic coordinate system {zi} as a function of the initial one {xi}.
Example 7.9 (The Einstein Universe). The Einstein Universe [58, ¬ß¬ß 134‚Äì141] is
a homogeneous and static model of the Universe12 whose underlying geometrical
structure is the (4-dimensional) Einstein manifold. This manifold is a Riemannian
4-dimensional manifold with metric g which, in suitable coordinates (x1 = œá, x2 =
Œ∏, x3 = œï, x4 = ct) (c is the velocity of light in vacuum), with respective ranges
R, (0, œÄ], [0, 2œÄ) and (‚àí‚àû, +‚àû), has components gij, i, j = 1, . . . , 4, forming the
diagonal matrix (see, e.g, [58, eq. (138.6)] or [62, eq. (12.135)])
[gij] = diag(‚àíR2, ‚àíR2 sin2 x1, ‚àíR2 sin2 x1 sin2 x2, 1)
(7.42)
where R is a constant (known as the radius of the spherical space representing
the spacial part of the Einstein Universe). This metric induces a Riemannian

32 = cot x2.
(7.43)
(Notice, these coeÔ¨Écients are exactly the coeÔ¨Écients (7.15) of the sphere S3 in R4.)
Consequently, the coordinate system {xi} is normal for ‚àáon the 2-dimensional
subspace {v : x1(v) = x2(v) = œÄ
2 } of the Einstein Universe.
Example 7.10 (The de Sitter Universe). The de Sitter Universe [58, ¬ß¬ß 136, 142‚Äì
145], [62, ¬ß 12.7] is also a homogeneous and static model of the Universe. It is
based on a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold, called the de Sitter manifold,
whose metric g in suitable coordinates (x1 = œá, x2 = Œ∏, x3 = œï, x4 = ct) has
components gij such that [58, eq. (142.3)]
[gij] = diag(‚àíR2, ‚àíR2 sin2 x1, ‚àíR2 sin2 x1 sin2 x2, cos2 x1)
(7.44)
for some constant R. Applying (4.13) and (4.15) (see also (7.43)), one can verify
that the Riemannian connection ‚àáinduced by g has in {xi} the following non-
vanishing coeÔ¨Écients (cf. (7.43))
Œì1
22 = ‚àísin x1 cos x1
Œì1

(7.45)
Evidently, the coordinate system {xi} is normal for ‚àáon the 2-dimensional sub-
manifold {v : x1(v) = x2(v) = œÄ
2 } of the de Sitter Universe.
Via an appropriate change {xi} ‚Üí{yi} of the local coordinates, one can
transform the metric‚Äôs components gij to gy
ij such that (see, e.g., [58, ¬ß 142,
eq. (142.11)] or [62, eq. (12.161)])
[gij] = diag(‚àíe2Œ∫y4, ‚àíe2Œ∫y4, ‚àíe2Œ∫y4, y4)
(7.46)
for some number Œ∫ Ã∏= 0. The non-vanishing coeÔ¨Écients yŒìi

i4 = yŒìi
4i = ‚àíŒ∫
for i = 1, 2, 3
yŒì4
kk = Œ∫e2Œ∫y4
for k = 1, 2, 3.
(7.47)
Thus the coordinates {yi} are nowhere normal for ‚àáregardless that the metric
looks ‚Äòsimpler‚Äô in them.

7. Examples of normal coordinates
65
The above conclusion is due to the main diÔ¨Äerence between the coordinates
systems {xi} and {yi}: the former reÔ¨Çects the symmetry of the de Sitter spacetime
(its spacial part is spherically symmetric) while the latter one ‚Äòtends to represent‚Äô
this space ‚Äòas near as possible‚Äô to the Ô¨Çat Minkowski space R4

Exercise 7.5. Using (6.13) with ci
... = 0, construct from {yi} a geodesic coordinate
system {zi} normal for ‚àáat some Ô¨Åxed point.
Example 7.11 (Non-static spacially homogeneous Universes). If we admit the con-
stant R to change with the time, R2 = R2
0ef(x4) for some R0 ‚ààR and C1 function
f, in the Einstein metric (7.42), we obtain a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold
with a metric g which in some Ô¨Åxed coordinates system {xi} has components gij,
i, j = 1, . . . , 4, forming the diagonal matrix
[gij] = diag(‚àíR2

0ef(x4) sin2 x1, ‚àíR2
0ef(x4) sin2 x1 sin2 x2, 1)
=: diag(g1, g2, g3, g4).
(7.48)
This manifold represents a non-static (and spacially homogeneous) model of the
Universe in the general theory of relativity [58, ¬ß¬ß 147‚Äì149; eq. (149.7)], [62, ¬ß 12.8].
The Riemannian connection generated by g has in {xi} the following non-vanishing

logical constant determine the pressure and energy density [58, ¬ß 150, eqs. (150.7)
and (150.8)]) is responsible for the existence of set(s) on which the coordinate
system {xi} is normal. Indeed, if the equation f ‚Ä≤(x4) = 0 has a real solution x4
0,
f ‚Ä≤(x4
0) = 0, then {xi} is normal on the 1-dimensional submanifold {v : x1(v) =

0}.
Exercise 7.6. If f ‚Ä≤(a) Ã∏= 0 for all a ‚ààR, construct from {xi} a coordinate system
{zi} which is normal at a Ô¨Åxed spacetime point.
Example 7.12 (The light cone in Minkowski spacetime). The 4-dimensional man-
ifold M4 = R4
3 (or the isomorphic to it manifold R4
1) is know as the Minkowski
spacetime and it is the geometrical base for the special theory of relativity and the
whole relativistic physics [20, 21, 51, 59‚Äì64]. The causal structure of the physical

66
Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
theories based on it is determined by the so-called light cone C3
3 which is deÔ¨Åned
as a ‚Äòpseudosphere‚Äô of index 3 and zero radius in it,
C3
3 = {v ‚ààR4
3 : e4
3(v) = 0}
= {(v1, v2, v3, v4) ‚ààR4
3 : (v1)2 ‚àí(v2)1 ‚àí(v3)2 ‚àí(v4)2 = 0}.
(7.50)
The light cone is a 3-dimensional 1-connected Cœâ manifold whose geometry is
very well explored due to its physical signiÔ¨Åcants. From the view-point of the
considerations in Example 7.5, it is described by the choice n = 3 (n + 1 = 4),
q = 3, p = 0, and r = 0. The metric e4
3, when restricted to C3
3, induces a (1-time)
degenerate tensor Ô¨Åeld on C3
3 which can further be restricted on other subsets of
C3
3 to give a Riemannian metric g, which generates a connection ‚àáon them.
The diÔ¨Äerent kinds of pseudospherical coordinates in R4
3 are not suitable
for studding the light cone due to its vanishing radius when it is consider as a
pseudosphere. For instance, in the coordinates (œÅ, œá, œÑ1, œï) in R4
3, provided by (7.22)
and such that
u2 = œÅ sinh œá sin œÑ1 cos œï
u4 = œÅ sinh œá cos œÑ1
u3 = œÅ sinh œá sin œÑ1 sin œï
u1 = œÅ coshœá,
we have C3
3 = {v ‚ààR4
3 : œÅ(v) = 0} and the components of e4
3 in it are given by
the diagonal matrix diag(1, ‚àíœÅ2, ‚àíœÅ2 sinh œá, ‚àíœÅ2 sinh œá sin œÑ1). Therefore u1|C3
3 ‚â°0
and the ‚Äòmetric‚Äô induced by e4
3 will have components forming the degenerate matrix
diag(1, 0, 0, 0); the cause for this is that the change (u1, u2, u3, u4) ‚Üí(œÅ, œá, œÑ1, œï)
is degenerate on the light cone.
Below we shall investigate two concrete coordinates systems in R4
3 which are
suitable for description of the light cone C3
3.
DeÔ¨Åne on R4
3 coordinates (H, R, Œ∏, œï), with respective ranges R, (0, ‚àû), (0, œÄ]
and [0, 2œÄ), such that
u2 = R sin Œ∏ cos œï
u3 = R sin Œ∏ sin œï
u4 = R cos Œ∏
u1 = H.
(7.51)
The Jacobian of the change to the new coordinates equals ‚àíR2 sin Œ∏ Ã∏= 0, so
that they are well deÔ¨Åned. These coordinates agree with the splitting R4
3 =
R1 √ó R3
3 and (R, Œ∏, œï) are spherical coordinates in R3. In them C3
3 = {v ‚àà
R4
3 : H = ‚àíR or H = +R} and the components of e4
3 form the diagonal ma-
trix diag(1, ‚àí1, ‚àíR2, ‚àíR2 sin Œ∏). The set of functions
{x1 = R, x2 = Œ∏, x3 = œï}
(7.52)

7. Examples of normal coordinates
67
is a coordinate system on the future part {v ‚ààR4
3 : H = +R} or the past part
{v ‚ààR4
3 : H = ‚àíR} of the light cone C3
3. The components of the tensor g obtained
by restricting e4
3 to C3
3 has in {x1, x2, x3} components gij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, such that13
[gij] = diag(0, ‚àí(x1)2, ‚àí(x1)2 sin2 x2).
(7.53)
Consequently g is degenerate and hence does not deÔ¨Åne on the light cone a Rieman-
nian metric; one can prove that this result is independent of the particular coordi-
nates used. However, on the set C3
3|R=R0 = {v ‚ààR4
3 : H = ¬±R0, R = R0} ‚äÇC3
3,
where R0 is a Ô¨Åxed positive real number, the restriction of e4
3 or of g results into a
Riemannian metric ¬Øg which in the coordinates {x1 = Œ∏, x2 = œï} on C3
3|R=R0 has
components ¬Øgij, i, j = 1, 2 such that
[¬Øgij] = diag(‚àíR2
0, ‚àíR2
0 sin2 x1) = ‚àídiag(R2
0, R2
0 sin2 x1).
(7.54)
Consequently ¬Øg = ‚àígS2, where gS2 is the metric on the 2-sphere S2 of radius R0 in
R3 (see (7.10)). So, if ¬Ø‚àáis the Riemannian connection on C3
3|R=R0 induced by ¬Øg,
then its non-vanishing coeÔ¨Écients in {x1, x2} are (7.11). Hence {x1, x2} is normal
along the path Œ≥ : [0, 2œÄ) ‚ÜíC3
3|R=R0 such that x1 ‚ó¶Œ≥ = œÄ
2 and x2 ‚ó¶Œ≥ = id[0,2œÄ).
Geometrically C3
3|R=R0 is the intersection of C3
3 with the 3-plane u1 = ¬±R0;
physically this 3-plane represents the spacial part of the spacetime at the moment
t = ¬±r0/c, c being the velocity of light in vacuum.
Let us now look on the light cone C3
3 from the view-point of coordinates
(œÅ, œá, R, œï) in R4
3 such that
u1 = œÅ cosh œá
u2 = œÅ sinh œá
u3 = R cos œï
u4 = R sin œï.
(7.55)
The range of œÅ is R\ {0}, the one of œá is R, R ranges in (0, ‚àû), and œï takes values
in [0, 2œÄ). The Jacobian of the change to the new coordinates equals œÅR and hence
they are well deÔ¨Åned. The light cone has in these coordinates the representation
C3
3 = {v ‚ààR4
3 : œÅ2 = R2} and the components of e4
3 in them form the diagonal
matrix diag(1, ‚àíœÅ2, ‚àí1, ‚àíR2). The set {œÅ, œá, œï} is a coordinates system on C3
3 in
which the tensor g, to which e4
3 reduces on C3
3, has components gij, i, j = œÅ, œá, œï,
such that
[gij] = diag(0, ‚àíœÅ2, ‚àíœÅ2).
(7.56)
(The same result can be obtained in the coordinate system {¬±R, œá, œï}.) Thus g is
degenerate and does not deÔ¨Åne a Riemannian metric on the light cone. However,
when restricted to the set C3
3|œÅ=œÅ0 = {v ‚ààR4
3 : œÅ(v) = œÅ0 and R = |œÅ0|} ‚äÇC3

restrict it to the light cone where H2 = R2.

Chapter I. Manifolds. Riemannian Coordinates
a Ô¨Åxed number œÅ0 ‚ààR \ {0}, this tensor (or e4
3) reduces to a Riemannian metric
¬Øg whose components ¬Øgij, i, j = 1, 2, in {x1 = œá, x2 = œï} are given by
[¬Øgij] = diag(‚àíœÅ2
0, ‚àíœÅ2
0) = ‚àíœÅ2
0 diag(1, 1).
(7.57)
Hence ¬Øg = ‚àíœÅ2
0e2
0, where e2
0 is the standard Euclidean metric in R2
0 = R2 (see Ex-
ample 7.1). In this way, we see that, if ¬Ø‚àáis the Riemannian connection induced by
¬Øg on C3
3|œÅ=œÅ0, then the coordinate system {x1 = œá, x2 = œï} is everywhere normal
on C3
3|œÅ=œÅ0 for ¬Ø‚àá. This conclusion is clear also from the geometrical interpretation
of C3
3|œÅ=œÅ0 as an intersection of the ‚Äò3-cylinder‚Äô R2

Terminology 1: Bases and frames. Holonomicity
It is beyond any doubt, all authors deÔ¨Åne a basis of an n-dimensional, n ‚ààN, vector
space as a set of n linearly independent vectors in it (see, for instance, [1,12, resp.
Section 1.5 and p. 9] or any book on vector spaces1). Sometimes the term ‚Äòframe‚Äô is
used as a synonym of basis [13, p. 8]. But when (tangent) vector Ô¨Åelds over a subset
U ‚äÜM of a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold of dimension n are concerned, the situation
slightly changes: a frame (n-frame, comoving (or moving) frame, or vielbein)2 is
deÔ¨Åned as a set of n linearly independent vector Ô¨Åelds over U [5, Sections 2.2
and 7.6] (see also [7]). It is easily seen that a frame over U is, in fact, a basis in the
module X(U) of vector Ô¨Åelds on U over the ring (algebra) F(U) of real or complex,
if the complex case is considered, functions on U [15, p. 10]. Furthermore, when
restricted to a single point x ‚ààU (or if U = {x}), any frame becomes a basis of
Tx(M). An evident example of a frame on a coordinate neighborhood U is the
frame {‚àÇ/‚àÇxi} associated with some coordinates {xi} on U (see [15, p. 10], [5,
p. 10], or Section 2).
Taking into account the above-said, as well as the argumentation in the
references cited, we accept the following deÔ¨Ånitions (cf. Subsection 2.3). If a single
vector space of Ô¨Ånite dimension n is concerned, the concepts ‚Äòbasis‚Äô and ‚Äòframe‚Äô
are synonyms and mean an arbitrary set on n linearly independent vectors in it.
A frame on (over) U ‚äÜM, M being manifold, is a set of dim M vector Ô¨Åelds on U
1Note, the given in [12, p. 9] deÔ¨Ånition (of Hamel) basis covers the case of inÔ¨Ånite, countable
or not, dimension too.
2For n = 3 (resp. n = 4) a frame is often called triad (resp. tetrad) or dreibein (resp. vierbein)
depending one prefers Greek or German.

such that at each x ‚ààU they form a basis in Tx(M), i.e., it is a Ô¨Åeld of bases over
U.3 So, a frame at (on, over) x and basis in Tx(M) are synonyms, i.e., equivalent
concepts. Further, in Chapter IV, we shall see that the notion of ‚Äòframe‚Äô admits a
natural generalization on vector bundles.4
Let {Ei, i = 1, . . . , dim M} be a frame on an open subset U in M. It is called
holonomic (resp. anholonomic) [19, p. 99Ô¨Ä], [11] if the basic Ô¨Åelds Ei commute
(resp. do not commute), i.e., if Ci
jk = 0 (resp. if Ci
jk Ã∏= 0 for at least one triple
(i, j, k)) where Ci
jk deÔ¨Åne the commutators
[Ej, Ek] := Ej ‚ó¶Ek ‚àíEk ‚ó¶Ej =: Ci
jkEi.
(8.1)
The functions Ci
jk are known as structure functions of the frame {Ei} (of the Lie
algebra of vector Ô¨Åelds). The frame {‚àÇ/‚àÇxi}, associated with local coordinates
{xi} in a neighborhood U, is holonomic,

Therefore, if we expand a frame {Ei} on U over {‚àÇ/‚àÇxi}, Ei = Bj

3Said diÔ¨Äerently, in terms of vector bundles, a frame on U is a section of the frame bundle
(= bundle of frames) restricted to U. The frame bundle over M is (cf. [23, 27], see also [5, p. 139
and Section 9.11]) a vector bundle with base M and whose Ô¨Åbre over x ‚ààM consists of all bases
in Tx(M).
4The just presented deÔ¨Ånition of frame corresponds to the case of the tangent bundle
(T(M), œÄ, M) over M (see Subsection IV.2.4). Here T(M) := 
x‚ààM Tx(M) and œÄ : T(M) ‚ÜíM
is such that œÄ(X) := x if X ‚ààTx(M).

We have to emphasize that the holonomicity is a property of the frames,
not of a particular basis. This is clear from (8.3) in which partial derivatives with
respect to the local coordinates (or to frame‚Äôs vector Ô¨Åelds) enter. The holonomicity
characterizes the frames with respect to the local existence of coordinates the
associated to which (holonomic) frame coincides with the initial one (in some
open subset of the manifold). Evidently (see (8.2)), only the holonomic frames can
admit such coordinates. The opposite assertion is (locally) true too.
Proposition 8.1. A frame {Ei} on a neighborhood U is holonomic iÔ¨Älocally exist
coordinates {yi} such that locally Ei = ‚àÇ/‚àÇyi.
Proof. Let {Ei} be the frame dual to {Ei},6 i.e., Ei = (Ei)‚àó, Ei(Ej) := Œ¥i
j.
Hence, if locally Ei = Aj
i‚àÇ/‚àÇxj, then Ej = (A‚àí1)j
kdxk, dxk := (‚àÇ/‚àÇxk)‚àó. We are
interested in the existence of local coordinate {yi} such that Ei = ‚àÇ/‚àÇyi which is
equivalent to Ei = dyi, i.e., Ei must be locally exact 1-forms [13, p. 108], [2, p. 55].
A necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for this is dEi = 0 (cf. Poincar¬¥e‚Äôs lemma [2,
p. 55], [13, p. 121]), i.e.,

Sometimes a frame is called holonomic if it coincides with the coordinate
frame generated by some local coordinates. Respectively, a frame is called locally
holonomic if every point in its domain has a neighborhood in which the frame
coincides with the coordinate frame generated by some local coordinates in this
neighborhood. By Proposition 8.1, the concept ‚Äòholonomic frame‚Äô in our sense
and ‚Äòlocally holonomic frame‚Äô in the above sense are identical. and will be used
further. The diÔ¨Äerence is that the latter emphasizes on the local link between the
holonomic frames and the local coordinates.
Proposition 8.1 suggests a deÔ¨Ånition of the property ‚Äòholonomicity‚Äô on arbi-
trary set U, not only on neighborhoods.
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.1. A frame {Ei} deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood U containing or equal
to a set U, U ‚äáU, is called holonomic on U, if there exists a chart (V, x) of M
such that V ‚äáU and Ei|U =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
		
U, i.e., the frame {Ei} coincides on U with the
coordinate frame generated by some local coordinates.
If U is a neighborhood and U = U, by virtue of Proposition 8.1, this deÔ¨Ånition
agrees with the afore-presented one.
6It is a frame in the cotangent bundle (T ‚àó(M), œÄ, M)|U with œÄ‚àí1(p) := T ‚àó
p (M), p ‚ààM (see
Subsection IV.2.4 below).

9. Conclusion
71
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.2. A frame {Ei} deÔ¨Åned on an open subset of M containing or equal
to a given set U is called locally holonomic on U if for every q ‚ààU exists a chart
(V, x) of M such that V ‚àãq and Ei|U‚à©V =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
		
U‚à©V , i.e., on U the frame {Ei}
locally coincides with the frame assigned to some local coordinates.
If U is a neighborhood, the local holonomicity agrees with the holonomicity,
as deÔ¨Åned above. But if U is not a neighborhood, e.g., if it is a submanifold of M,
the local holonomicity is weaker concept than the holonomicity.
The concept of a frame is especially useful in physics where the concept of a
basis (of a single space) is rarely utilized. More precisely, in physics the term frame
of reference or reference frame is applied. This is a set of (real or mathematical)
objects with respect to which is described the behavior, e.g., the evolution in
time, of some physical system(s). Such reference objects are practically always
deÔ¨Åned on some subset of the space(-time) which is frequently a neighborhood
or a curve (path) and very seldom chosen as a single point. Taking into account
that the frames are used for referring (describing) of vector Ô¨Åelds,7 which in turn
may represent some physical Ô¨Åelds, the analogy between frames and reference
frames is evident. The general idea is that to the physical concept reference frame
there corresponds the mathematical concept frame (in some vector bundle). (See,
e.g., [71], where a good analysis of diÔ¨Äerent kinds of reference frames can be found.)

Conclusion
This chapter, as we saw, has an introductory character. It does not contain new
original material except the implicit description of the frames normal at a single
point of a Riemannian manifold (Section 6) and partially the investigation of
normal frames/coordinates in Section 7.
After the presentation of the minimum knowledge from the diÔ¨Äerential ge-
ometry, required for our work, we started with the initial ideas concerning normal
frames and coordinates. The basic results here are: only torsionless linear connec-
tions (may) admit normal coordinates; if the torsion is non-zero, normal frames
(may) exit, but normal coordinates do not. If normal frames exist, they are parallel
and are connected with linear transformations whose matrices are constant under
the action of their basic vector Ô¨Åelds.
The Riemannian and geodesic coordinates, which are normal at their origins,
were pointed out as Ô¨Årst examples of normal coordinates.
7In the general case they are replaced with sections of vector bundles.

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections

Introduction
This chapter presents a complete exploration of the problems linked to the exis-
tence, uniqueness, and construction of normal coordinates and frames for manifolds
endowed with a linear connection, with or without torsion. The review of the lit-
erature dealing with normal coordinates is mixed with new results. Such are, Ô¨Årst
of all, the ones concerning normal frames, connections with non-vanishing torsion,
and the complete constructive description of the normal coordinates, if any.
The methods for description of normal coordinates/frames on Riemannian
manifolds can mutatis mutandis be transferred on arbitrary manifolds, real or com-
plex (K = R, C),1 endowed with linear connection. The possibility for this is hid-
den in the fact that the existence and properties of the normal coordinates/frames
on a Riemannian manifold is intrinsically connected with the properties of the
ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols, i.e., with the Riemannian connection, not with the particular
metric generating them. After this situation was clearly understood, somewhere
in 1922‚Äì1927 [50, 72‚Äì74] (see [19, p. 155] for other references), the attention of
the mathematicians, working in the Ô¨Åeld, was completely switched to the explo-
ration of normal coordinates on manifolds with linear connections. Practically
only the symmetric (torsionless) case has been investigate (see the comments af-
ter Remark I.5.4 on page 41). Some random works, like [44,75], dealing with the
asymmetric case (non-zero torsion) do not add nothing new as they simply note
that the symmetric parts (I.3.9) of the connection coeÔ¨Écients (in coordinate frame)
are coeÔ¨Écients of a symmetric linear connection to which the known results for
torsionless connections are applicable.
Below in this chapter, in more or less modern terms and notation, are re-
viewed all results concerning the existence of normal coordinates/frames on man-
ifolds endowed with symmetric linear connection. It contains a number of original
new results too.
At Ô¨Årst (Section 2), we concentrate on coordinates or frames normal at a
single point. We present the known classical methods in this Ô¨Åeld [18,19,70] and
then, modifying the methods that will be given in Chapter III in full generality,
we present a full description of these coordinates/frames.
In Section 3 the attention is turned on the coordinates or frames normal
along paths without self-intersections. For symmetric linear connections, we give
a detailed description of the Fermi coordinates as the Ô¨Årst known coordinates of
this kind with [19] being our basic reference. Then, modifying the methods devel-
oped for similar but more general problems (see Chapter III and [76]), we derive
a complete description of all coordinates or frames normal along paths without
self-intersections or along locally injective paths in manifolds with symmetric or,
respectively, arbitrary linear connections.
Several pages deal with problems concerning normal frames and coordinates
on submanifolds with maximum dimensionality (Section 4), in particular on neigh-

borhoods and on the whole manifold. We prove that such frames or coordinates
exist iÔ¨Äthe connection is (locally) respectively Ô¨Çat or Ô¨Çat and torsionless. A com-
plete description of the normal frames and coordinates in these cases is presented.
We also point to some links between normal frames and parallel transports for Ô¨Çat
linear connections.
Section 5 explores the problems of existence, uniqueness, and construction
of frames or coordinates normal on arbitrary submanifolds. The classical results
of [55] are reproduced in details using modern notation. Meanwhile, the corre-
sponding proofs are improved, some results are generalized for arbitrary connec-
tions, with or without torsion, and new ones are presented. Next, we provide
a complete constructive description of all frames (resp. coordinates) normal on
submanifolds of a manifold with arbitrary (resp. torsionless) linear connection.
Amongst a number of general results, we prove that normal on a submanifold
frames (resp. coordinates) exist iÔ¨Äthe parallel transport is path-independent along
paths lying entirely in it (resp. and the connection is torsionless).
Section 6 contains instances and exercises illustrating the general theory of
this chapter. Explicit expressions for frames and coordinates normal at a single
point in and along a great circle on a two-dimensional sphere are presented in a
case of the Riemannian connection induced from the Euclidean space in which the
sphere is embedded. Some problems connected with frames/coordinates normal
for Weyl connections are investigated. All frames/coordinates normal in the one-
dimensional case are explicitly described. A similar problem is solved along a
geodesic path in a 2-dimensional manifold. All coordinates normal at a point in
Einstein-de Sitter spacetime are found.
A brief recapitulation of the above items can be found in Section 7.
2.
The case at a single point
The coordinates/frames that are normal at a single point are the most simple and
widely known ones. The proof of existence of coordinates/frames normal at a single
point of Riemannian manifold presented in Section I.6 can be transferred, practi-
cally without changes, to manifolds endowed with symmetric linear connections.
The main steps of the so-obtained proof are outlined below in Subsection 2.1; for
details see [19, p. 155‚Äì159], [70, Chapter V, Section 3], or [18, Section 4.3].1
2.1.
Old classical method
Let M be a C‚àûK-manifold, K = R, C, endowed with C‚àûlinear connection
‚àá. Let p ‚ààM, V (p) be a normal neighborhood of p, (U, x) be a chart with
U ‚àãp, and {xi} be the local coordinates on U associated with (U, x). For every

conclusions.

and Œ≥(s) = q for some (unique) s0, s ‚ààJ. As the connection is of class C‚àû,
such are all geodesics, in particular Œ≥. Therefore in {xi} the expansion (I.6.3) with
Œ≥i = xi‚ó¶Œ≥ is valid. Successively diÔ¨Äerentiating the equation of geodesics (I.3.23), we

DeÔ¨Åne a coordinate system {yi} on U ‚à©V (p) ‚àãp = Œ≥(s0), q = Œ≥(s) by putting
yi(q) = ÀôŒ≥(s0)(s ‚àís0).
(2.2)
The coordinates yi are similar to the Riemannian coordinates of Section I.6 and
are called Riemannian normal coordinates with origin at the point p; obviously
yi(p) = 0. The explicit relations between {yi} and {xi} is (see (2.1) and cf. (I.6.9))

and yi(p) = 0, the transition {xi} ‚Üí{yi} is regular in some neighborhood W of
p in which the series (2.3) is convergent and invertible with respect to the y‚Äôs.2
Consequently the Riemannian normal coordinates are well-deÔ¨Åned in the domain
W ‚à©U ‚à©V (p) which is a normal neighborhood of p. In it the only common point
of every two geodesics though p is the point p itself. Thus we have proved the
following result which is an evident generalization of Proposition I.6.2.
Proposition 2.1. Every point of a C‚àûmanifold with C‚àûlinear connection has a
normal neighborhood in which Riemannian normal coordinates with origin at that
point can be introduced.
2This is a consequence of the implicit function theorem; e.g., see [77, Chapter III, ¬ß 8], [7,
Sections 1.37 and 1.38], [78, Chapter 10, Section 2], [79, Theorem 9.18].

2. The case at a single point
77
In the domain of Riemannian normal coordinates, any geodesic through their
origin has an equation like (2.2), i.e., the geodesics in these coordinates are locally
described by linear equations like the straight lines in Rn.
The adjective ‚Äònormal‚Äô in the Riemannian normal coordinates is justiÔ¨Åed by
the following results.
Proposition 2.2. The symmetric parts of the connection coeÔ¨Écients vanish at the
origin of the Riemannian normal coordinates

Corollary 2.1. If a C‚àûmanifold is endowed with symmetric C‚àûlinear connec-
tion, the connection‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écients vanish at the origin of Riemannian normal co-
ordinates.
Proof. See Proposition 2.2.

Thus the existence of normal coordinates/frames at a single point in the
symmetric C‚àûcase is proved.
Example 2.1. Consider a C‚àûsymmetric linear connection on C‚àûmanifold M.
Let p ‚ààM and in a chart (U, x) with U ‚àãp the only non-vanishing coeÔ¨Écient
of the connection at p to be Œì1

explicit connection between the coordinates {xi}, associated with (U, x), and the
Riemannian normal coordinates {yi} with origin at p:
x1(q) = x1(p) + ln(1 + y1(q))
xi(q) = xi(p) + yi(q)
for i ‚â•2,
from which the Riemannian normal coordinates can be expressed as
y1(q) = exp(x1(q) ‚àíx1(p)) ‚àí1
yi(q) = xi(q) ‚àíxi(p)
for i ‚â•2.

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
Notice, the Riemannian normal coordinates are ‚Äòmore than normal‚Äô at their
origin: at that point, the equations (I.6.11) hold with Œìi
jk replaced by Œìi
(jk). The
proof of this assertion is identical with the one of (I.6.11) in Section I.6.
Taking the above into account, we see that the equations of geodesics through
p in Riemannian normal coordinates is
Œ≥i(s) = Œ≥i(s0) + ÀôŒ≥i(s0)(s ‚àís0).
(2.5)
Exercise 2.1. Prove that a path given via the last equation in Riemannian normal
coordinates is a geodesic path through their origin.
A conclusion follows from the above: a path through the origin of the Rie-
mannian normal coordinates is (locally) a geodesic iÔ¨Äin them it is represented
with linear equations with respect to its parameter. Said diÔ¨Äerently, such paths
are geodesics iÔ¨Äthey are inverse images (with respect to the local coordinates) of
the straight lines through a Ô¨Åxed point in Kdim M.
According to [19, p. 158] and [53, p. 59], the Riemannian normal coordinates
for manifolds with symmetric linear connections, considered on them as coordi-
nates normal at a given point, were Ô¨Årst introduced in 1922 by O. Veblen [72].
Let {yi} be Riemannian normal coordinates on C‚àûmanifold endowed with
symmetric C‚àûlinear connection and p and U be their origin and domain respec-
tively. By the deÔ¨Ånition of normal coordinates (see Section I.5), the deÔ¨Åned on
U frame { ‚àÇ
‚àÇyi } is normal at p. Consequently, according to Proposition I.5.2, the
set of all frames on U normal at p is {Ei = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇyj } where the non-degenerate
matrix-valued function A := [Aj
i] is such that
‚àÇA
‚àÇyi |p = 0. (If required, the frames
{Ei} can be extended outside U in completely arbitrary ways.) As the point p
is arbitrary, in this way we have obtained a complete description of the frames
normal at a single point of a C‚àûmanifold endowed with symmetric C‚àûlinear
connection.3
It is almost self-evident, the Riemannian normal coordinates are not the only
local coordinates normal at some point in the symmetric case. For example, we can
deÔ¨Åne in a coordinate neighborhood U of p ‚ààM the geodesic normal coordinates
{zi} through the series (cf. (I.6.13))

Complete description
The above-presented way for introduction of normal coordinates is the historically
established one. Now we are going to modify it in order to obtain a full description
of all coordinates normal at a given point. The Ô¨Årst step in this direction is to
notice that, due to the deÔ¨Ånition of normal frames/coordinates, the utilization of
the geodesics in the construction of coordinates normal at a single point is not
necessary. This is a useful tool but it does not always work! For instance, as we
shall see, the geodesics may not exist (e.g., if the connection is not continuous)
while coordinates normal at a point exist. Also, we Ô¨Ånd too strong the requirement
for the underlying manifold to be of class C‚àû.
Proposition 2.3. Every point p of a C3 manifold with linear connection has a neigh-
borhood in which exist coordinates such that the symmetric parts of the connection
coeÔ¨Écients in them vanish at p. All such coordinates are given via equation (2.11‚Ä≤)
below in which the coordinates {xi} are arbitrary, [bi
j] is non-degenerate constant
matrix, and the C3 functions bi
jkl together with their partial derivatives are bounded
in the domain of {yi}. The inverse transformation {yi} ‚Üí{xi} is given by equa-
tion (2.11) below with [ai
j] = [bi
j]‚àí1.
Proof. Let M be a C3 manifold endowed with linear connection ‚àáon which we do
not impose any diÔ¨Äerentiability conditions. Choose an arbitrary point p ‚ààM and
charts (U, x) and (V, y) such that p ‚ààU‚à©V Ã∏= ‚àÖ. As we know from Subsection I.2.1,
the local coordinates xi(q) and yi(q) of every point q ‚ààU ‚à©V are connected via C3
functions yi(q) = f i
x1(q), . . . , xdim M(q)

, or f i = ri ‚ó¶y ‚ó¶x‚àí1 with ri being the
standard coordinate functions on Kdim M. Since f i and

f i‚àí1 are C3 functions,
there exist numbers ai
j, ai
jk ‚ààK and C3 functions ai
jkl : U ‚à©V ‚ÜíK, which together
with their partial derivatives are bounded on U ‚à©V , such that
xi(q) = xi(p) + ai
j[yj(q) ‚àíyj(p)] + ai
jk[yj(q) ‚àíyj(p)][yk(q) ‚àíyk(p)]
+ ai
jkl(q)[yj(q) ‚àíyj(p)][yk(q) ‚àíyk(p)][yl(q) ‚àíyl(p)].
(2.7)

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
By virtue of the above-said, this formula is invertible on U ‚à©V with respect to
yi(q) which can be expressed in a similar way as functions of {xi(q)}:
yi(q) = yi(p) + bi
j[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)] + bi
jk[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)][xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)]
+ bi
jkl(q)[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)][xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)][xl(q) ‚àíxl(p)],
(2.8)
where bi
j, bi
jk ‚ààK are constants and bi
jkl : U ‚à©V ‚ÜíK are of class C3 and they and
their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded on U ‚à©V .
Now the problem, which is central for us, is: given a point p and coordinates
{xi}, can a chart (V, y) be chosen so that {yi} are normal at p? As one can expect,
the answer is positive if the connection is symmetric.
From (2.7) and (2.8), we derive:
‚àÇxi
‚àÇyj
			
p = ai
j,
‚àÇyi
‚àÇxj
			
p = bi
j,
‚àÇ2xi
‚àÇyjyk
			
p = 2ai
(jk),
‚àÇ2yi
‚àÇxjxk
			
p = 2bi
(jk)
(2.9)
where the matrices [ai
j] and [bi
j] are non-degenerate as a consequence of the in-
vertability of (2.7) and (2.8) at p. Using the equality
‚àÇxi
‚àÇyk
‚àÇyk
‚àÇxj = Œ¥i
j and the one
obtained from it by diÔ¨Äerentiation with respect to xl, we Ô¨Ånd from (2.9)

Let
xŒìi
jk and
yŒìi
jk be the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáin {xi} and {yi} respectively. Applying
the transformation laws (I.3.6) and (2.9), we get at p:

[ai

So, at p we can obtain

(jk)(p) = 0 if and only if 2al

xŒìl
mn(p)
which, due to (2.10), is equivalent to 2bi
(jk) = bi
l
xŒìl
jk(p).4 Substituting the last
equation into (2.7), we see that all coordinates {yi} for which
yŒìi
(jk)(p) = 0, if
such exist, are obtainable from Ô¨Åxed coordinates {xi} by inverting the equation
xi(q) = xi(p) + ai

is non-degenerate, by the implicit function
theorem (see [77, Chapter III, ¬ß 8], [7, Sections 1.37 and 1.38], or [78, Chapter 10,
Section 2]), there exists a neighborhood W of p in which (2.11) deÔ¨Ånes yi as
unique C3 functions of xi. Hence, in the neighborhood V = U ‚à©W ‚àãp, the
mappings {xi} ‚Üí{yi} and {yi} ‚Üí{xi}, deÔ¨Åned via (2.11) and (2.11‚Ä≤) in which
xi(p) and yi(p) are Ô¨Åxed numbers, are C3 diÔ¨Äeomorphisms. This ends to proof of
Proposition 2.3.
‚ñ°
If we specify the connection to be symmetric, from Proposition 2.3, we obtain
a theorem describing all local coordinates normal at a given point.
Theorem 2.1. Every point p of a C3 manifold endowed with symmetric linear
connection has a neighborhood on which coordinates normal at p exist. All normal
coordinates {yi} in the mentioned neighborhood are given via equation (2.11‚Ä≤) in
which the coordinates {xi} are arbitrary, [bi
j] is non-degenerate constant matrix,
and the C3 functions bi
jkl together with their partial derivatives are bounded in the
domain of {yi}. The inverse transformation {yi} ‚Üí{xi} is given by (2.11) with
[ai
j] = [bi
j]‚àí1.
This theorem gives a complete description of all normal coordinates at a
single point of a C3 manifold with symmetric linear connection. Analogous result
concerning the normal frames is provided by the following theorem.
Theorem 2.2. Let {yi} be coordinates normal at a point p in a C3 manifold with
symmetric linear connection. In the domain U of {yi} all frames normal at p
have the form

Ei = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇyj

, where the non-degenerate matrix-valued function
A = [Ai
j] is such that ‚àÇA
‚àÇyj
		
p = 0.5 Outside U the frames can be extended arbitrarily.
All of these frames normal at p are holonomic at p but in U\{p} they need not to
be such.
Proof. See Propositions I.5.2 and I.5.3.
‚ñ°
Remark 2.1. In the notation of Theorem 2.3 on the next page below, the explicit
form of A is given via (2.14) with yi for xi and Œìi
jk(p) = 0 (as {yi} is normal at
p), i.e.,
A(q) = A0 + Ajk(q)[yj(q) ‚àíyj(p)][yk(q) ‚àíyk(p)].

For the proof, see the proof of Theorem 2.3 below. The frames {Ei} holonomic on
U and normal at p are such that Ei =

normal at p. In this case Ai
j = ‚àÇyi
‚àÇzj which, due to (2.12), implies
zi(q) = yi(p) + (A‚àí1
0 )i
j(q)[yj(q) ‚àíyj(p)]
+ bi
jkl(q)[yj(q) ‚àíyj(p)][yk(q) ‚àíyk(p)][yl(q) ‚àíyl(p)],
(2.13)
where bi
jkl : U ‚ÜíK are of class C1 and they and their partial derivatives are
bounded on U. Of course, this result is a special case of (2.11‚Ä≤) as {yi} are normal
at p and the connection considered is symmetric.
If the manifold and its connection are of class C‚àû, the choice ai
j = Œ¥i
j and
the expansion of ai
jkl into a power series, with suitable coeÔ¨Écients, brings us back
to the results of Subsection 2.1.
Theorem 2.2 can easily be generalized to arbitrary linear connections, with
or without torsion:
Theorem 2.3. Let M be a C2 manifold endowed with linear connection. For every
point p ‚ààM there exist frames normal at p. Moreover, if (U, x) is a chart with
U ‚àãp, then in U all frames normal at p are

Ei = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj

where A := [Ai
j]: U ‚Üí
GL(dim M, K), with GL(n, K) being the group of all n√ón invertible matrices with
entries in K, is non-degenerate, of class C1, and its general form is
A(q) =

1 ‚àíŒìj(p)[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)]

A0
+ Ajk(q)[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)][xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)]
q ‚ààU.
(2.14)
Here Œìi are the matrices of the connection coeÔ¨Écients, A0 is constant and non-
degenerate matrix, and Ajk are C1 matrix-valued functions on U such that they
and their partial derivatives are bounded at p.
Proof.
A frame {E‚Ä≤
i} is normal at p iÔ¨ÄA satisÔ¨Åes (I.5.4) with {p} for U and
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
for Ei, i.e.,
‚àÇA
‚àÇxi
		
p + Œìi(p)A(p) = 0. Supposing A to be of class C2, we can write
the expansion
A(q) = A0 + Ak[xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)] + Ajk(q)[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)][xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)],
where A0, Ai ‚ààGL(dim M, K) are constant, A0 is non-degenerate, and the C1
matrix-valued functions Ai
jk on U together with their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are
bounded at p. From the last equation, we get A(p) = A0 and
‚àÇA
‚àÇxi
		
p = Ai and
hence (see above) Ai = ‚àíŒìi(p)A0, the substitution of which into the last displayed
equation gives (2.14).
‚ñ°
Theorem 2.3 gives a complete constructive description of all frames normal
at a single point.
The above description of the normal coordinates/frames is an adaptation of
the developed in [80] methods (see also Chapter III) for the case of manifolds with
linear connections.

2. The case at a single point

2.3.
Modern classical method
In the modern books on diÔ¨Äerential geometry, the normal coordinates as described
in Subsection 2.1 are most often not mentioned at all; see, e.g,: [11, Chapter III,
¬ß 8], [12, pp. 313‚Äì314], [10, p. 110], [28, p. 133], [1, ¬ß 6.7], and [8, ¬ß 3.8, (ii)]. Nowa-
days the coordinates normal at a point are introduced by means of the exponential
mapping (see Subsection I.3.4), like in the references just cited. This method is
practically identical with the introduction of Riemannian normal coordinates, pre-
sented in Subsection 2.1, only other terminology and concepts are involved. It is
brieÔ¨Çy outlined below.
Let M be a C2 manifold, p ‚ààM, and (U, œï) be a chart with U ‚àãp. The chart
(U, œï) or the associated with it local coordinates {œïi} are called normal at p (with
respect to p) if the inverse images of the straight lines through œï(p) ‚ààKdim M are
geodesics in M through p. This deÔ¨Ånition, as we shall see further, agrees with our
previous terminology (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.2).
Let a basis {ei} in Tp(M) be given. Since the mapping ŒΩ : Tp(M) ‚ÜíKdim M
deÔ¨Åned by X ‚Üí(X1, . . . , Xdim M) for X = Xiei ‚ààTp(M) is a linear isomorphism,
the exponential mapping can be used to deÔ¨Åne normal coordinates in a neighbor-
hood of p. The chart (Tp(M), ŒΩ) of Tp(M) provides a natural coordinate system on
Tp(M). Let V 0
p ‚äÜTp(M) and V (p) ‚äÜM be normal neighborhoods such that the
exponential mapping expp : V 0
p ‚ÜíV (p) is a diÔ¨Äeomorphism (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.6).
Consider a local chart (V (p), x) with
x := ŒΩ ‚ó¶exp‚àí1
p : V (p) ‚ÜíKdim M.
(2.15)
If Œ≥p,X : J ‚ÜíV (p), J ‚àã0 ‚ààR is the unique geodesic with Œ≥p,X(0) = p and
ÀôŒ≥p,X(0) = X, its current coordinates in the coordinate system {xi} are
Œ≥i
p,X(s) := xi(Œ≥p,X(s)) = (ri ‚ó¶x)(Œ≥p,X(s)) = (ri ‚ó¶ŒΩ ‚ó¶exp‚àí1
p ) ‚ó¶expp(sX)
= ri(ŒΩ(sX)) = ri(sX1, . . . , sXdim M) = sXi,
s ‚ààJ
where (I.3.29) is used and {ri} are the standard coordinate functions on Kdim M.
Reversing the last equalities, we see that any path given by Œ≥i(s) = sXi in
{xi} is a geodesic through p. Consequently {xi} are normal coordinates at p
according to the last deÔ¨Ånition. In case of symmetric connection, the coordi-
nates {xi} are also normal according to DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.2. Indeed, if Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM
is a geodesic through p, in {xi} we have Œ≥i(s) = sXi for some Xi ‚ààK, the
substitution of which in the geodesic equation (I.3.23‚Ä≤) on page 32 results in
Œìi
(jk)

x‚àí1(sX1, . . . , sXdim M)

XjXk = Œìi
(jk)(Œ≥(s))XjXk ‚â°0 with Œìi
jk being
the connection coeÔ¨Écients in {xi}. In particular we have
0 = Œìi
(jk)(p)XjXk = Œìi
(jk)(x‚àí1(0))XjXk
as p = x‚àí1(0), 0 ‚ààKdim M. Since X is completely arbitrary, such are Xi, and
consequently
Œìi
(jk)(p) := 1
2

Œìi
jk(p) + Œìi
kj(p)

= 0.

84
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
So, if the connection is symmetric, then Œìi
jk(p) = 0, i.e., {xi} are normal coordi-
nates at p in the sense of DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.2.
Comparing the above results with the ones in Subsection 2.1, we see that
in the case of a C‚àûmanifold with C‚àûlinear connection the coordinates {xi}
are just the Riemannian normal coordinates introduced in Subsection 2.1. For
this reason, we Ô¨Ånd it appropriate and convenient to call the coordinates deÔ¨Åned
by (2.15) Riemannian normal coordinates, not simply normal as in the literature
cited, with an exception of [8, ¬ß 3.8, (ii)], and at the beginning of this subsection;
thus we reserve the adjective ‚Äònormal‚Äô for frames and coordinates described via
DeÔ¨Ånitions I.5.1 and I.5.2.
At the end, let us note that in [8, ¬ß 3.8, (ii)] the local coordinates, described
by (2.15) (with ƒ± := ŒΩ‚àí1 being a linear isometry), are applied to a proper Rieman-
nian manifold (the metric being positively deÔ¨Ånite) which results to a new con-
struction of the particular Riemannian coordinates obtained by G. D. BirkhoÔ¨Ä[50]
(see p. 48). These coordinates appear in [8, ¬ß 3.8, (ii)] under the name Riemannian
normal coordinates.
3.
The case along paths without self-intersections
The Ô¨Årst proof of existence of coordinates normal along curve without self-inter-
sections on (C‚àû) Riemannian manifold was given by E. Fermi in 1922 [52]. The
explicit formula for transition to the coordinates discovered by E. Fermi was
given by Levi-Civita in 1926 [81]. Analogous result on (C‚àû) manifold with ar-
bitrary symmetric (C‚àû) connection was originally published by L. P. Eisenhart
in 1927 [53, p. 64].1 These special types of coordinates are widely known as Fermi
coordinates [19, Chapter III, ¬ß 8], [8, ¬ß 3.8, (ii)]. Sometimes they are referred as
Fermi geodesic coordinates [12, p. 327]2 and very rarely as geodesic (along a curve)
coordinates [25, ¬ß 91], [44].
Since all of the proofs, known to the author, of the existence of such coordi-
nates are more or less identical at a level of ideas, i.e., a construction of particular
class of coordinates with the property required, we suggest to call Fermi coor-
dinates the special kind of coordinates normal along a path described below in
Subsection 3.1, thus reserving the term ‚Äòcoordinates normal along a path‚Äô for a
particular realization of DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.2.
1For other original papers on this topic, see [19, p. 166].
2More precisely, in [12, p. 327] is done the following. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be without self-
intersections and for some s0 ‚ààJ a basis {E0
i } in TŒ≥(s0)(M) be Ô¨Åxed. DeÔ¨Åne along Œ≥ a frame
{Ei} such that Ei|Œ≥(s0) = E0
i and (‚àáÀôŒ≥Ei)|Œ≥(J) = 0, i.e., {Ei} is obtained from {E0
i } by means
of parallel propagation along Œ≥. Notice, {Ei} is deÔ¨Åned only on Œ≥(J); outside Œ≥(J) it can be
extended arbitrarily. The Fermi geodesic coordinates with domain U, U ‚à©Œ≥(J) Ã∏= ‚àÖ, are local
coordinates {xi} such that
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi |p = Ei|p for p ‚ààU ‚à©Œ≥(J). Generally these coordinates are not
normal along Œ≥ in U.

3. The case along paths
85
One must be aware of the fact that as ‚ÄòFermi coordinates‚Äô can be found coor-
dinate systems entirely diÔ¨Äerent from the ones we are dealing with. For instance, in
the literature on general relativity under the name ‚ÄòFermi coordinates‚Äô are known
completely diÔ¨Äerent coordinates which generally are not normal at all but along
a geodesic in a Riemannian manifold they are normal at their origin [62, Chap-
ter II, ¬ß 10]. More precisely, in the last case the coordinates mentioned, as deÔ¨Åned
in [62, Chapter II, ¬ß 10], coincide with the normal coordinates introduced by
BirkhoÔ¨Ä(see p. 48). The cause for this is that these coordinates are deÔ¨Åned by
means of the Fermi-Walker transport [62, Chapter I, ¬ß 4] which along a geodesic
coincides with the parallel transport along it. Another example of ‚ÄòFermi coordi-
nates‚Äô, which generally are not normal, may be found in [28, pp. 133‚Äì134]. In [55]
the term ‚ÄòFermi coordinates‚Äô is a synonym of our notion of ‚Äòcoordinates normal on
a submanifold‚Äô.
There are two basic methods for proving the existence of coordinates normal
along paths without self-intersections. The Ô¨Årst one is to construct a speciÔ¨Åc co-
ordinate system in a neighborhood of the path and then, by explicit calculation,
to show that along the path given the coordinates constructed are normal. The
second one consist in Ô¨Ånding a particular (class of) solution of equation (I.5.4‚Ä≤) on
page 41 along a given path. A typical example of the former method is given in
Subsection 3.1, while a modiÔ¨Åcation of the latter method is presented in Subsec-
tion 3.2
Below in this section, the manifold M will be considered as real one, i.e., if
it is complex, it will be regarded as real one of dimension 2 dimM = 2 dimC M =
dimR M (see page 7).3 Formally we shall reÔ¨Çect this by writing dimR M(= dim M
if M is real and = 2 dimC M if M is complex) instead of dim M for the dimension
of M; respectively, all Latin indices, whose range is not speciÔ¨Åed, run from 1 to
dimR M and the values of the coordinate homeomorphisms will be in RdimR M.
3.1.
Fermi coordinates
Below, following [19, pp. 166‚Äì169], we shall prove the existence of coordinates
normal along a (part of a given) path without self-intersections by explicit con-
struction of concrete such coordinates. Regardless of the technical diÔ¨Éculties, the
idea of the proof is quite simple and consists in the following. In a neighbor-
hood of the path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, the manifold M is (locally) represented as a direct
sum of suitable (dimR M ‚àí1)-dimensional submanifolds Vs, one for each point
Œ≥(s), s ‚ààJ. So, every point p of this neighborhood belongs to a single Vs(p) for
some unique s(p) ‚ààJ. Then the Fermi coordinates of p are (s(p), Œæ2, . . . , ŒædimR M)
where (Œæ2, . . . , ŒædimR M) are the Riemannian normal coordinates of p with respect
3In this way we avoid some completely technical problems connected with the fact that the
domain of every path is a real interval by deÔ¨Ånition. Roughly speaking, if Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is C1 regular
injective path in a complex manifold M, the set Œ≥(J) is a submanifold of M with real dimension
dimR Œ≥(J) = 1 and complex one dimC Œ≥(J) = 1/2, the last case, of non-integer dimension, being
out of the range of our work.

to Œ≥(s(p)) in Vs(p) considered as a (dimR M ‚àí1)-dimensional submanifold of M.
The details of this construction are presented below and their aim is the formula-

At every point Œ≥(s) ‚ààŒ≥(J) ‚à©U, s ‚ààJU := {u|u ‚ààJ, Œ≥(u) ‚ààU}, we
consider the geodesics Œ≤s : JX ‚ÜíU with initial conditions Œ≤s(t0) = Œ≥(s) and
ÀôŒ≤s(t0) = XŒ≥(s) for s ‚ààJU, some Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààJX, and arbitrary X as deÔ¨Åned above

4A C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is regular if ÀôŒ≥(s) Ã∏= 0, ‚àûfor all s ‚ààJ (see p. 14).
5A point p ‚ààŒ≥(J) is called self-intersection point of Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM if there exist s1, s2 ‚ààJ such
that s1 Ã∏= s2 and Œ≥(s1) = Œ≥(s2) = p. Given s0 ‚ààJ, the number k(p) of the diÔ¨Äerent values s ‚ààJ
with s Ã∏= s0 and Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(s0) = p is called self-intersection number of Œ≥ at p = Œ≥(s0); we also
say that Œ≥ self-intersects (itself) k(p) times at p. If k(p) = 0 for all p ‚ààŒ≥(J), the path Œ≥ is said
to be without self-intersections, i.e., Œ≥ is without self-intersections if for every s1 ‚ààJ there does
not exist s2 ‚ààJ, s1 Ã∏= s2 with Œ≥(s1) = Œ≥(s2). In other words, Œ≥ is without self-intersections if Œ≥
is an injective mapping.
6If J has left or/and right end (boundary) point(s) and s0 happens to be its left or right
end, some complications arise; e.g., with the deÔ¨Ånition of ÀôŒ≥(s0) as a corresponding one-sided
(left or right) limit, the implicit function theorem [77, Chapter III, ¬ß 8] can not be applied in a
neighborhood of (s0, Œ≥(s0)), etc. Generally this is not a typical situation and we exclude it for a
moment from our investigation. Later we will drop this assumption. These complications are due
to the fact that if J is closed from one or both ends, the set Œ≥(J) is a manifold with boundary
(see Remark I.2.1 on page 6) which we treat with methods for manifolds without boundary. They
will not appear if from the beginning one starts with manifolds with boundary.

construct a particular realization of this link.
Let f i : JU ‚ÜíR, with s ‚ààJU := {u|u ‚ààJ, Œ≥(u) ‚ààU}, be C1 functions
and f 1 be C1 diÔ¨Äeomorphism from JU on the image f 1(JU). We shall Ô¨Ånd these
functions from the requirement that7
x‚Ä≤ 1
Œ≤s(t)

x‚Ä≤ i
Œ≤s(t)

:= f i(s) + (t ‚àít0)X‚Ä≤ i,
i ‚â•2
(3.3)
which is a special realization of the above general connection between {xi} and
{x‚Ä≤ i}.
Remark 3.1. Here and below we implicitly suppose that the family of geodesic paths
{Œ≤s} forms (for diÔ¨Äerent X) an (dimR M ‚àí1)-dimensional foliation along the path Œ≥,
i.e., that the sets Vs := {Œ≤s(JX) where X, as deÔ¨Åned above, is arbitrary} are such that:

Œ≥(s)‚ààU Vs = U, Vs ‚à©Vs‚Ä≤ = ‚àÖfor s Ã∏= s‚Ä≤, s, s‚Ä≤ ‚ààJ and Vs ‚à©Œ≥(J) = Œ≥(s). Then for every
p ‚ààU there exists only one s ‚ààJ such that p ‚ààVs. Equations (3.3) mean that at Ô¨Årst
we deÔ¨Åne the coordinates of p with respect to Œ≥(s) in Vs and then of Œ≥(s) along Œ≥. The
existence of such a foliation {Vs} along Œ≥, which is overlooked in [19], is natural but not
trivial and requires corresponding proof. Rigorously we have to do the following. Let {yi}
be any coordinate system in U. In Subsection 3.2 (see the text preceding equation (3.12))
will be proved that there exist an interval J1 ‚äÜJ and neighborhood U1 ‚äÜU such
that ÀôŒ≥1
y|J1 Ã∏= 0 and Œ≥1
y|J1 : J1 ‚ÜíŒ≥1
y(J1) is diÔ¨Äeomorphism (Œ≥k
y := yk ‚ó¶Œ≥). Now, in a
neighborhood U ‚Ä≤
1 of Œ≥(J1) in U1, choose {yi} such that
‚àÇ
‚àÇyi
		
Œ≥(s) = E‚Ä≤
i
		
Œ≥(s) for s ‚ààJ1
and deÔ¨Åne Vs :=

p ‚ààU ‚Ä≤
1|y1(p) = Œ≥1(s)

.8 Then we have U ‚Ä≤
1 = 
s‚ààJ1 Vs, Vs ‚à©Vs‚Ä≤ = ‚àÖ
7Generally the last condition on f1 can not be satisÔ¨Åed on the whole interval JU if equa-
tions (3.3) hold (see below the comment after (3.5)). If this happens to be the case, the interval
JU must be replaced by some open subinterval J‚Ä≤
U ‚äÇJU containing the initial point s0, J‚Ä≤
U ‚àãs0.
8Such coordinates {yi} always exist ‚Äì see [76, Lemma 4.1] or Lemma 5.2 on page 116 for
dimR N = 1.

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
for s Ã∏= s‚Ä≤, s, s‚Ä≤ ‚ààJ1 and Vs ‚à©Œ≥(J1) = Œ≥(s) for s ‚ààJ1. The sets Vs are (dimR M ‚àí1)-
dimensional submanifolds of M. At last, in each Vs we take a normal neighborhood V 0
s
of Œ≥(s) ‚ààVs and put U 0
1 := 
s‚ààj1 V 0
s . It is evident that U 0
1 is a neighborhood of Œ≥(J1)
and for every p ‚ààU 0
1 there exists a unique s(p) ‚ààJ1 such that there is unique geodesic
Œ≤s(p) joining p and Œ≥(s(p)) in V 0
s(p). Thus, generally, we are forced to consider instead of
U and J smaller sets U 0
1 ‚äÜU and J1 ‚äÜJ, respectively, on which the foliation mentioned
exists. Hence, to be quite precise, below we have to replace U with U 0
1 and J with J1
where U 0
1 and J1 are deÔ¨Åned above. Since these ‚Äòdetails‚Äô do not change the main ideas
and formulae, we leave them and follow [19] directly.
As Œ≤s(t0) = Œ≥(s), now the equation of Œ≥ is x‚Ä≤ i(Œ≥(s)) = f i(g(Œæ)), i ‚â•2, where
g :=

f 1‚àí1 and Œæ := x‚Ä≤ 1(Œ≤s(t)) = x‚Ä≤ 1(Œ≥(s)). Hence along Œ≥ the A‚Äôs and Œì‚Äôs may
be considered as functions of Œæ = f 1(s) as s = (f 1)‚àí1(Œæ) =: g(Œæ). Consequently,
using (3.3), we transform (3.2) into

3. The case along paths
89
of f 1(s) = Œ≥‚Ä≤ 1(s) ‚àíŒ≥‚Ä≤ 1(s0) + c1, s ‚ààJU may be a problem. If we can Ô¨Ånd some
i0 ‚àà{1, . . ., dimR M} for which f i0 : JU ‚Üíf i0(JU), given by (3.5), is C1 diÔ¨Äeo-
morphism, we can simply renumber the coordinates and take f i0 for f 1. But this
is also an exception. In the most general case, we, on the base of the implicit
function theorem,9 can only assert that if Œ≥‚Ä≤ 1 Ã∏= 0, s ‚ààJU, then there exists an
open interval J‚Ä≤
U ‚äÜJU such that the restriction f 1|J‚Ä≤
U : J‚Ä≤
U ‚Üíf 1(J‚Ä≤
U) is a C1 dif-
feomorphism.10 Thereof the special coordinates {x‚Ä≤ i}, given via (3.3), are deÔ¨Åned
only for s ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
U with f i given by (3.5).
Let us summarize the above discussion. We started with some s0 ‚ààJ and a
chart (U, x) with U ‚àãŒ≥(s0). Then a parallel frame {E‚Ä≤
i} along Œ≥ was constructed,
‚àáÀôŒ≥E‚Ä≤
i = 0, with E‚Ä≤
1|Œ≥(s0) = ÀôŒ≥(s0), and coordinates {x‚Ä≤ i} in U such that E‚Ä≤
i|p =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx‚Ä≤ i
		
p for p ‚ààU ‚à©Œ≥(J) = Œ≥(JU) and for which (3.3) holds with f i given by (3.5).
Below we are going to prove that there exists a neighborhood of Œ≥(s0) in
which the coordinates {x‚Ä≤ i} are normal along Œ≥.
As the coordinate system {xi} is completely arbitrary, we can take {x‚Ä≤ i} for
it, xi = x‚Ä≤ i. This results in A(p) = [Aj
i(p)] = 1, with 1 = [Œ¥j
i ] being the dimR M √ó
dimR M identity (called also unit) matrix, and
‚àÇ
‚àÇx‚Ä≤ i =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi = E‚Ä≤
i. Inserting these
equalities into (3.4) and omitting the primes, we get

[79, Theorem 9.18]. Notice, at that precise place, the assumption that s0 is not an end point of
J, if any, is explicitly used. Also the assumption of regularity of Œ≥ at (every) s0 is essential here.
10Here we suppose Œ≥‚Ä≤ 1(s) Ã∏= 0 for all s ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
U. Below we point out that this may not be the
case, but there always exist intervals JŒ¥ ‚àãs0, JŒ¥ ‚äÜJU such that Œ≥‚Ä≤ 1|JŒ¥ Ã∏= 0. One can deÔ¨Åne J‚Ä≤

the last equations, we conclude that Œìk
1j(s) = 0 for j ‚â•1 if ÀôŒ≥1(s) Ã∏= 0. (If Œ≥ is a
geodesic, then E‚Ä≤
1|Œ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥(s) and hence ÀôŒ≥1(s) = ÀôŒ≥‚Ä≤ 1(s) = 1 for all s ‚ààJ, but this is
not the general case.) Now it is time to use the choice E‚Ä≤
1|Œ≥(s0) = ÀôŒ≥(s0) again: from
this it follows ÀôŒ≥1(s0) = 1 and ÀôŒ≥j(s0) = 0 for j ‚â•2, as now

Since Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is supposed to be of class C1, the function ÀôŒ≥1 : J ‚ÜíR is of class
C0, i.e., continuous. Thereof for every Œµ ‚ààR with Œµ > 0 there exists Œ¥ ‚ààR, Œ¥ > 0
(Œ¥ may depend on Œµ) such that |ÀôŒ≥1(s) ‚àíÀôŒ≥1(s0)| < Œµ for s ‚ààJ and |s ‚àís0| < Œ¥. So,
in the interval JŒ¥ := {s ‚ààJ, |s ‚àís0| < Œ¥} ‚äÜJ is fulÔ¨Ålled 1 ‚àíŒµ < ÀôŒ≥1(s) < 1 + Œµ as
ÀôŒ≥1(s0) = 1.
At the end, we choose some Œµ ‚ààR, 0 < Œµ < 1 and Ô¨Åx corresponding Œ¥ ‚ààR,
Œ¥ > 0. Then for s ‚ààJ0 := J‚Ä≤
U ‚à©JŒ¥, we have 0 < 1 ‚àíŒµ < ÀôŒ≥1(s) and hence ÀôŒ≥1(s) Ã∏= 0.
So equations (3.8) imply Œìk
1j(s) = 0 for all j ‚â•1. Combining this with (3.7) and
taking into account that now the connection considered is symmetric, we Ô¨Ånally
obtain

The so-constructed coordinates {x‚Ä≤ i} are called Fermi coordinates along Œ≥
(with a reference path Œ≥). By deÔ¨Ånition, their domain is a subneighborhood U ‚äÜU
such that U ‚à©Œ≥(J) ‚äÜŒ≥(J0) as we supposed that s0 is not a boundary point of J,
if any.
Now a few words are in order for the case when the interval J is closed from
one or both ends and s0 is its end point. In such a case, the above investigation can
be modiÔ¨Åed as follows. Let s0 be the left (or, resp., right) end of J. DeÔ¨Åne ÀôŒ≥(s0) =
ÀôŒ≥+(s0) (resp. ÀôŒ≥(s0) = ÀôŒ≥‚àí(s0)) via (cf. (I.2.3)) (ÀôŒ≥¬±(s0))(f) := limŒµ‚Üí¬±0 1
Œµ[f(Œ≥(s0 +
Œµ)) ‚àíf(Œ≥(s0))], f ‚ààF(Œ≥(s0)) where Œµ ‚Üí+0 (resp. Œµ ‚Üí‚àí0) means that Œµ tends to
0 ‚ààR with values greater (resp. less) than zero. Now take some interval J‚Ä≤ ‚äÉJ for
which s0 is inner, not boundary, point and certain regular C1 path Œ≥‚Ä≤ : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM
without self-intersections such that Œ≥‚Ä≤|J = Œ≥ and ÀôŒ≥‚Ä≤(s0) = ÀôŒ≥(s0).11 All of the above
results and conclusions are completely valid for Œ≥‚Ä≤ at s = s0 ‚ààJ‚Ä≤. Consequently,
applying them to Œ≥‚Ä≤ and restricting the results to Œ≥ = Œ≥‚Ä≤|J, we obtain their true
versions for any point along Œ≥, including the one(s) corresponding to the end(s) of
11The choice of J‚Ä≤ and Œ≥‚Ä≤ can be made in inÔ¨Ånitely many ways. The procedure just described is
actually the deÔ¨Ånition of Œ≥i (or of Œ≥) as C1 mappings on a manifold with boundary, the interval
J in the particular case, according to the deÔ¨Ånition in Footnote I.5 on page 7.

3. The case along paths

J. Of course, the construction of the Fermi coordinates at the end point(s) of J
depends on the particular choice of Œ≥‚Ä≤ : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM but this is not essential as we are
interested only in their existence, not in their concrete properties.
Generally the Fermi coordinates are local and are not deÔ¨Åned along the whole
path Œ≥. Since the point s0 is arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed in the above considerations, the main
moral from them is:
Proposition 3.1. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be regular C1 path without self-intersections in
C‚àûmanifold endowed with C‚àûlinear connection. For every point p ‚ààŒ≥(J) there
is its neighborhood on which Fermi coordinates exist.
Proposition 3.2. In Fermi coordinates, the coeÔ¨Écients of a symmetric linear con-
nection vanish along the part of their reference path lying in their domain.
Corollary 3.1. If Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a regular C1 path without self-intersections in C‚àû
manifold endowed with C‚àûsymmetric linear connection, then for every s ‚ààJ
exists a neighborhood U of Œ≥(s) and coordinates in it, in which the connection
coeÔ¨Écients vanish on Œ≥(J) ‚à©U.
Remark 3.2. When proving the existence of the Fermi coordinates, we have used
implicitly several times the absence of self-intersection points of Œ≥. This is most
evident in (3.3): if Œ≥ has self-intersection points, at them x‚Ä≤ i(Œ≤s)) and xi(Œ≤s)) are
not injective functions of s and, hence, f 1 can not be a diÔ¨Äeomorphism from J on
f 1(J). It is evident that the above considerations hold on any ‚Äòpart‚Äô of Œ≥ without
self-intersections, if any.
Remark 3.3. Our construction of the Fermi coordinates is essentially more precise
and, correspondingly, longer than the one in [19, pp. 166‚Äì169]. In this reference
a number of implicit conditions are presupposed. For example: Œ≥ is regular and
without self-intersections, Œ≥ is contained in a single coordinate neighborhood (one
and the same for {xi} and {x‚Ä≤ i}), ÀôŒ≥1(s) Ã∏= 0 for all s ‚ààJ, etc.
Remark 3.4. Often, especially in the physical literature, the Fermi coordinates
are referred as ones in which the coeÔ¨Écients of a symmetric linear connection
vanish along the whole path Œ≥. This is true if Œ≥ is geodesic (or a path ‚Äònear‚Äô to
geodesic), contained in a single coordinate neighborhood, but in the general case
this is a wrong assertion. Generally along Œ≥ we can construct a family of Fermi
coordinates such that Œ≥(J) is contained in the union of their domains and the
connection coeÔ¨Écients in them vanish along the corresponding pieces of Œ≥. Said in
other words, as a rule there is not a single Fermi system of coordinates in whose
domain Œ≥(J) is contained and in which the connection coeÔ¨Écients vanish on the
whole set Œ≥(J).
Remark 3.5. If the connection is non-symmetric, in the constructed Fermi coordi-
nates vanish the symmetric parts of some, but generally not all, of its coeÔ¨Écients
‚Äì see (3.7) and (3.8). As the symmetrized connection coeÔ¨Écients are coeÔ¨Écients
of a symmetric linear connection (see (I.3.9) and the comments before it), we can
construct Fermi coordinates for this symmetric connection. In these particular co-

92
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
ordinates, the symmetric parts of the initial connection coeÔ¨Écients vanish along
their reference path.
For torsionless linear connection, in the Fermi coordinates, hold not only
equations (3.7), but we also have (cf. (I.6.11))
Œìi
i1...in+1(p) = 0
n ‚ààN, p ‚ààŒ≥(J‚Ä≤
U), i ‚â•1, i1, . . . , in+1 ‚â•2

n ‚ààN, p ‚ààŒ≥(J‚Ä≤
U), i ‚â•1, i1, . . . , in+2 ‚â•2
(3.10b)
which equalities are obtained from (3.6) by repeated diÔ¨Äerentiation.
From the construction of the Fermi coordinates, a conclusion can be made
that these coordinates are not the only ones (locally) normal along pieces of a
given path. For instance, one can construct some analogue of the geodesic nor-
mal coordinates at a given point (see page 48) by replacing in (3.1) and in the
next formulae Œìi
i1,...,in by some constants ci
i1,...,in. We are not going to describe
here such modiÔ¨Åcations because further a complete description of the coordinates
normal along a path will be presented.
On the contrary to the Fermi coordinates along Œ≥, which are essentially local,
one can construct global frames along Œ≥ which are normal along the whole path
Œ≥. Actually, let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, J being open R-interval, be regular C1 path without
self-intersections and {JŒ±
0 |Œ± ‚ààA}, A being a non-empty set, be an open cover of
J such that for every p ‚ààŒ≥(J) the set Ap := {Œ±|Œ± ‚ààA, Œ≥(JŒ±
0 ) ‚àãp} consists of one
or two elements and for each Œ± ‚ààN exist Fermi coordinates {xi
Œ±} with domain
UŒ± such that UŒ± ‚à©Œ≥(J) = Œ≥(JŒ±
0 ). DeÔ¨Åne along Œ≥ a frame {Ei} such that, for every
p ‚ààŒ≥(J), Ei|p =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxiŒ±
		
p if Œ≥(JŒ±
0 ) ‚ààp for a single Œ± ‚ààA and if the set Ap consists
of two elements, we arbitrarily choose some Œ≤ ‚ààAp and set Ei|p =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
Œ≤
		
p. The so-
obtained frame {Ei} is normal along Œ≥ but generally it is not smooth, even it may
not be continuous, along the whole path Œ≥. Hence the holonomicity problem for
this frame is globally ill-posed.12 All other frames normal along Œ≥ can be obtained
from {Ei} according to the recipe of Proposition I.5.2.
At the end, we want to mention one special type of Fermi coordinates in a
neighborhood of (injective normal) geodesic in Riemannian manifold.
Example 3.1. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be geodesic in a Riemannian manifold M with metric
g. Let {Ei} be a parallel frame along Œ≥ with E1 = ÀôŒ≥, i.e., ‚àáÀôŒ≥Ei = 0 and E1 = ÀôŒ≥;
we can also say that {Ei|Œ≥(s)}, s ‚ààJ is obtained from some Ô¨Åxed basis {ei} in
TŒ≥(s0)(M), with s0 ‚ààJ and e1 = ÀôŒ≥(s0), by a parallel transporting it from Œ≥(s0)
to the other points in Œ≥(J). For (s, t) = (s, t2, . . . , tdimR M) ‚ààJ √ó RdimR M‚àí1, we
deÔ¨Åne ƒ±: (s, t) ‚Üí
i‚â•2 tiEi|Œ≥(s) ‚ààTŒ≥(s)(M). If Œ≥ is injective, i.e., without self-
intersections, and normal, i.e., g(ÀôŒ≥, ÀôŒ≥) = 1, in [8, ¬ß 3.8 (ii)] it is proved that there
12With a little attention, one can see that locally {Ei} is smooth and holonomic on the part
of Œ≥ corresponding to a single interval JŒ±
0 , but in the regions of intersections of such intervals
the smoothness of the frame may be lost.

3. The case along paths
93
exists a neighborhood V0 of the zero vector in RdimR M‚àí1 and a neighborhood U of
Œ≥(J) in M such that the mapping y := (exp ‚ó¶ƒ±|J√óV0)‚àí1 : U ‚ÜíJ √ó V0 ‚äÜRdimR M‚àí1
is diÔ¨Äeomorphism. The associated to the chart (U, y) coordinates {yi} are called
in [8, ¬ß 3.8 (ii)] Fermi coordinates. In the same reference it is proved that the
coordinates {yi} so-deÔ¨Åned are normal along Œ≥, Œìi
jk ‚ó¶Œ≥ = 0, and orthonormal,
gij(Œ≥(s)) = ¬±Œ¥ij, s ‚ààJ, at the same time. Thereof we conclude, the Fermi co-
ordinates along injective (without self-intersections) normal geodesic are similar
to the orthonormal Riemannian coordinates found by BirkhoÔ¨Ä(see page 48), but
when the latter are considered ‚Äòalong paths‚Äô.
Exercise 3.1. Prove that the coordinates of Example 3.1 agree with our deÔ¨Ånition
of ‚ÄòFermi coordinates‚Äô. (Hint: Œ≤s(t) = x‚àí1(s,ÀÜt) where one of the components of
ÀÜt ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1 is equal to t, the others being constants.)
3.2.
Complete description
As we said earlier, the second method for proving the existence of coordinates or
frames normal along a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is via direct solving of the equation (I.5.4)
along Œ≥:

ŒìkA + Ek(A)
		
Œ≥(J) = 0
(3.11)
or
Œìk(Œ≥(s))A(Œ≥(s)) +

Ek(A)
		
Œ≥(s) = 0.
(3.11‚Ä≤)
Let us recall the notation here. The coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection ‚àáare Œìi
jk
and Œìk :=

are their matrices in an arbitrarily chosen frame {Ei} in
a neighborhood of Œ≥(J). We want to Ô¨Ånd a C1 matrix-valued function A := [Aj
i]
such that the frame(s) {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej} is (are) normal along Œ≥, i.e., on Œ≥(J). A
necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for this is A to be a solution of (3.11).
Now we pose a problem: given a C2 manifold M endowed with symmetric C0
connection ‚àáand a regular C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM without self-intersection, describe
all frames and local coordinates normal respectively along Œ≥ and on (some part(s)
of) Œ≥(J). Below we describe the general solution of this problem by adapting the
method of [76, Section 3] to the particular situation just outlined; we also employ
the initial idea underlying the construction of coordinates normal along a path
in [25, pp. 428‚Äì431]. We shall see that the solution in terms of frames is easier and
more simple than the one in terms of local coordinates.13 This is not occasional: to
a coordinate system {xi} corresponds the frame {‚àÇ/‚àÇxi}, but to obtain the local
coordinates corresponding to a holonomic frame {Aj
i‚àÇ/‚àÇxj}, one has to solve a
system of Ô¨Årst-order partial diÔ¨Äerential equations. Said diÔ¨Äerently, the normal
frames are obtained by solving a Ô¨Årst-order system of partial diÔ¨Äerential equations
13The same situation will be met in Chapters III‚ÄìV for much more general problems.

94
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
(see (I.5.4)) while the corresponding system for the normal coordinates is of second
order (see (I.5.4‚Ä≤) on page 41).14
Below we are going to prove the existence of solutions of (3.11) and to Ô¨Ånd
its general solution, which results in a complete description of all frames normal
along a regular C1 path. The main results are formulated below as Theorem 3.1 on
page 97 to which theorem the reader can jump right now if he/she is not interested
in the details of its proof.
To begin with, we shall construct local coordinates in a neighborhood of a
point in Œ≥(J) such that a point in their domain has the path‚Äôs parameter as its
Ô¨Årst coordinate.
Lemma 3.1. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be a regular C1 injective path in a C3 manifold M.
For every s0 ‚ààJ, there exists a chart (U1, x) of M such that Œ≥(s0) ‚ààU1, x: U1 ‚Üí
J1 √ó RdimR M‚àí1 for some open subinterval J1 ‚äÜJ, s0 ‚ààJ1 and x(Œ≥(s)) = (s, t0)
for all s ‚ààJ1 and some Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1.
Proof. Let s0 ‚ààJ be a point in J which is not an end point of J, if any, and (U, y)
be a chart with Œ≥(s0) in its domain, U ‚àãŒ≥(s0), and y: U ‚ÜíRdimR M. From the reg-
ularity of Œ≥, ÀôŒ≥ Ã∏= 0, follows that at least one of the numbers ÀôŒ≥1
y(s0), . . . , ÀôŒ≥dimR M
y
(s0),
where Œ≥i
y := yi ‚ó¶Œ≥, is non-zero. We, without lost of generality, choose this non-
vanishing component to be ÀôŒ≥1
y(s0).15 Then, due to the continuity of ÀôŒ≥ (Œ≥ is of class
C1) and according to the implicit function Theorem [77, Chapter III, ¬ß 8], [7, Sec-
tions 1.37 and 1.38], [78, Chapter 10, Section 2], there exists an open subinterval
J1 ‚äÜJ containing s0, J1 ‚àãs0, and such that ÀôŒ≥1|J1 Ã∏= 0 and the restricted mapping
Œ≥1
y|J1 : J1 ‚ÜíŒ≥1
y(J1) is a C1 diÔ¨Äeomorphism on its image. DeÔ¨Åne a neighborhood
U1 :=

y(J1)

Œ≥1
y(J1) √ó RdimR M‚àí1

and a chart (U1, x) with local coordinate functions

k = 2, . . . , dimR M
(3.12)
where tk

‚àÇy1 = ‚àí
ÀôŒ≥k
y
ÀôŒ≥1y
for k ‚â•2, and ‚àÇxk
‚àÇyl = Œ¥k
l for k, l ‚â•2, the Jacobian of the change {yi} ‚Üí{xi} at
p ‚ààU1 is
1
ÀôŒ≥1(p) Ã∏= 0, ‚àû. Consequently x: U1 ‚ÜíJ1√óRdimR M‚àí1 is really a coordinate
homeomorphism with coordinate functions xi.
14This is realized implicitly in [25, p. 429] in the method developed in this work for Ô¨Ånding a
class of coordinates normal along a path.
15If it happens that ÀôŒ≥1
y(s0) = 0 and ÀôŒ≥i0
y (s0) Ã∏= 0 for some i0 Ã∏= 1, we have simply to renumber
the local coordinates to get ÀôŒ≥1
y(s0) Ã∏= 0. Practically this is a transition to new coordinates
{yi} ‚Üí{zi} with z1 = yi0 and, for instance, zi0 = y1 and zi = yi for i Ã∏= 1, i0, in which the Ô¨Årst
component of ÀôŒ≥ is non-zero. We suppose that, if required, this coordinate change is already done.
If occasionally it happens that ÀôŒ≥j0
y (s) Ã∏= 0 for all s ‚ààJ and Ô¨Åxed j0, it is extremely convenient
to take this particular component of ÀôŒ≥ as ÀôŒ≥1
y ‚Äì see the next sentence.

3. The case along paths
95
In the new chart (U1, x), the coordinates of Œ≥(s), s ‚ààJ1 are
Œ≥1(s) := (x1 ‚ó¶Œ≥)(s) = s,
Œ≥k(s) := (xk ‚ó¶Œ≥)(s) = tk
0, k ‚â•2,
(3.13)
i.e.,
x(Œ≥(s)) = (s, t0)
for some t0 = (t2
0, . . . , tdimR M
0
) ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1 and all s ‚ààJ1.
‚ñ°
Lemma 3.1 means that the chart (U1, x) is so luckily chosen that the Ô¨Årst
coordinate in it of a point along Œ≥ coincides with the value of the correspond-
ing path‚Äôs parameter, the other coordinates being constant (along Œ≥) numbers.
Moreover, in U1 the path Œ≥ can be considered as a representative of a family
of paths Œ∑( ¬∑ , t): J1 ‚ÜíM, t ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1, deÔ¨Åned by Œ∑(s, t) := x‚àí1(s, t) for
(s, t) ‚ààJ1 √ó RdimR M‚àí1; indeed, Œ≥ = Œ∑( ¬∑ , t0) or Œ≥(s) = Œ∑(s, t0), s ‚ààJ1 ‚äÜJ.
Remark 3.6. In this way we have obtained a natural foliation of U1 along Œ≥:
putting Vs := {x‚àí1(s, t)|t ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1}, we see that 
s‚ààJ1 Vs = U1, Vs ‚à©Vs‚Ä≤ = ‚àÖ
for s Ã∏= s‚Ä≤, s, s‚Ä≤ ‚ààJ1, and Vs ‚à©Œ≥(J1) = Œ≥(s) for s ‚ààJ1. Having this in mind, the
main idea of the next considerations in this subsection is in each (dimR M ‚àí1)-
dimensional submanifolds Vs (see p. 7) to be constructed frames or coordinates
normal at the single point Œ≥(s) (as a point of Vs) and then to joint them smoothly
along Œ≥. We shall see in Section 5 below that this is possible due to the one-
dimensionality of Œ≥(J1) considered as a submanifold of M.
Remark 3.7. The vector Ô¨Åeld ÀôŒ≥ tangent to Œ≥ has in the coordinates {xi}, associ-
ated with the chart (U1, x) provided by Lemma 3.1, the components (1, 0, . . . , 0).
Consequently, if Œ≥ is a geodesic path (see Subsection I.3.4), the geodesic equa-
tion (I.3.23) reduces to
Œìi
11 ‚ó¶Œ≥ = 0.
(3.14)
Hence {xi} is generally not normal along a geodesic path, but along such a path
the last equation holds.
Remark 3.8. We have met examples of concrete kinds of coordinates systems {xi}
in Examples I.7.3, I.7.4 and I.7.5 in which they happen to be normal along the
paths considered in them.
Now we are ready to solve equation (3.11) in the neighborhood U1. Let us take
an arbitrary point p ‚ààU1 with coordinates (s, t) ‚ààJ1 √ó RdimR M‚àí1 in (U1, x), i.e.,
x(p) = (s, t) or p = Œ∑(s, t) = x‚àí1(s, t). The mapping p ‚Üíp0 := Œ≥(x1(p)) ‚ààŒ≥(J1)
deÔ¨Ånes a useful for our purposes ‚Äòprojection‚Äô of p on Œ≥ (or on Œ≥(J)) along the family
Œ∑; in coordinates, if p = Œ∑(s, t), then p0 = Œ≥(s) = Œ∑(s, t0), i.e., x(p0) = (s, t0) for
x(p) = (s, t).
Suppose A is of class C3. Then [57, Section 4.10-5] there exist C1 matrix-
valued functions Bkl on U1 such that they and their partial derivatives are bounded

and
Ek(A)|Œ≥(s) =

t=t0, k =‚â•2 as Œ≥(s) = Œ∑(s, t0). Substituting (3.15)
into (3.11‚Ä≤), we split (3.11‚Ä≤) into equivalent to it system of equations

(3.16b)
Lemma 3.2. Let J be R-interval, s0 ‚ààJ be Ô¨Åxed, and Z be continuous, square
matrix-valued, and non-zero function on J. On J exists a unique (square) non-
degenerate matrix-valued function Y satisfying the initial-valued problem:
dY
ds = ZY,
Y |s=s0 = 1,
Y = Y (s, s0; Z)
(3.17)
where s ‚ààJ and 1 is the identity (unit ) matrix of the corresponding size.
Proof. See [34, Chapter IV, Section 1] or [82, pp.125‚Äì127].16
‚ñ°
Remark 3.9. This lemma and its multidimensional version (see Lemma 4.1) play
a crucial role in our general approach for investigating normal frames. They are
simple corollaries of the theorems of existence and uniqueness for normal systems
of ordinary or partial diÔ¨Äerential equations of Ô¨Årst order. By means of Y , we can
express every solution of the matrix equation
dX
ds = ZX
(3.18)
with the C1 matrix-valued function X being of the same size (order) as Z in (3.17).
The general solution of (3.18) is
X = Y (s, s0; Z)
(3.19)
with arbitrary s0 ‚ààJ, or
X = Y (s, s0; Z)X0
(3.20)
16The solution of (3.17) is called matricant.

3. The case along paths
97
with Ô¨Åxed s0 ‚ààJ and arbitrary X0. The particular solution of (3.18) satisfying
the initial condition
X|s=s0 = X0
(3.21)
for some s0 ‚ààJ and X0 is given by (3.20). At present, special properties of Y ,
such as Y ‚àí1(s, s0; Z) = Y ‚àí1(s0, s; Z) or Y (s, s1; Z)Y (s1, s0; Z) = Y (s, s0; Z), will
not be needed.
Remark 3.10. If the order of the matrices in (3.17) is important, we write 1n for 1
with 1n being the n√ón, n ‚ààN, identity matrix; respective labels may be attached
to Y and Z if required.
The general solution of equation (3.16a), which immediately follows from
Lemma 3.2 and Remark 3.9, is
A(Œ≥(s)) = Y (s, s0; ‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥)B
(3.22)
where Y is deÔ¨Åned by the initial-value problem (3.17), with 1 = 1dimR M, and B
is constant non-degenerate dimR M √ó dimR M matrix. Inserting (3.16b) in (3.15)
and using (3.22), we Ô¨Ånd:
A(p) =

1 ‚àíŒìk(p0)[xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)]

Y (x1(p), s0; ‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥)B
+ Bkl(p)[xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)][xl(p) ‚àíxl(p0)]
(3.23)
where we have used p = Œ∑(s, t), Œ∑ = x‚àí1, and p0 := Œ≥(x1(p)) = Œ≥(s). Note,
in (3.23) the terms corresponding to k = 1 and/or l = 1 vanish due to x1(p0) =
x1(Œ≥(x1(p))) = (x1 ‚ó¶Œ≥)(x1(p)) = x1(p) = s.17
In the above investigation we have supposed s0 not to be an end-point of
J, if any. This restriction is completely inessential for the Ô¨Ånal results, like (3.22)
and (3.23). Actually, if J has end point(s), we, analogously to the scheme described
on page 90, can proceed as follows. If s0 is the left/right end of J, we deÔ¨Åne ÀôŒ≥(s0)
such that (ÀôŒ≥f)(s0), f ‚ààF(Œ≥(s0)) is the left/right derivative of f ‚ó¶Œ≥ at s = s0.
Take an open interval J‚Ä≤ ‚äÉJ and let Œ≥‚Ä≤ : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM be such that Œ≥‚Ä≤|J = Œ≥ and
ÀôŒ≥‚Ä≤|J = ÀôŒ≥. Applying all of the above considerations for Œ≥‚Ä≤ instead of Œ≥ and restrict-
ing the results to Œ≥ (or to Œ≥(J)), we see that all of the above investigation remain
valid with the only changes that now the interval J1 (after the restriction) may
turn to be closed from its left/right end and correspondingly U1 may be neigh-
borhood with boundary, i.e., a (dimR M)-dimensional submanifold with boundary
(see Remark I.2.1 and Footnote I.5 on page 7).
Let us explicitly formulate the results obtained.
Theorem 3.1. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be a C1 regular path without self-intersections in C3
manifold M endowed with (arbitrary) C0 linear connection ‚àá. For every s0 ‚ààJ,
there exist a neighborhood U1 of Œ≥(s0) and a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} on U1 which is normal for
17If we would have started with some i0 Ã∏= 1, for which ÀôŒ≥i0 Ã∏= 0, the result will be (3.22)
and (3.23) with Œìi0 instead of Œì1. In the intermediary steps, e.g., starting from (3.12), the index
1 must be replace with i0. For instance, p0 will be deÔ¨Åned by p0 := Œ≥(xi0(p)), so xi0(p0) = xi0(p)
and the corresponding terms with k = i0 and/or l = i0 in (3.23) will vanish.

98
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
‚àáalong Œ≥, i.e., it is normal on U1 ‚à©Œ≥(J). Moreover, in U1 exist coordinates {xi}
such that Œ≥1(s) = s and Œ≥i(s) = const, for i ‚â•2 and s ‚ààJ1, with J1 ‚äÜJ being a
subinterval of J and Œ≥(J1) ‚äÇU1. All such normal frames are

i(p) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxj
		
p

,
p ‚ààU1, where the C3 non-degenerate matrix-valued function A = [Aj
i] is given
via (3.23).
Remark 3.11. This result is considerably more general than we expected at the
beginning: it concerns all linear connections, with or without torsion.
Proof. The Ô¨Årst part of the theorem follows from the above-constructed solu-
tions (3.22) for every s0 ‚ààJ and arbitrary, symmetric or not, connection ‚àá, as
we did not use any assumption on the symmetry of its coeÔ¨Écients. The second
assertion is a consequence of the fact that (3.22), with arbitrary B, is the general
solution of (3.11) in the coordinates {xi} in U1 deÔ¨Åned by (3.12).
‚ñ°
Remark 3.12. If we replace the C3 diÔ¨Äerentiability of A with C1 diÔ¨Äerentiability,
then (3.23) will be a solution of (3.11) but we cannot assert that it will be the gen-
eral one. So, if M is of class C2 and A is of class C1, then Theorem 3.1 remains valid
with an exception that there may exist matrices of class C1 but not C3 that are so-
lutions of (3.11) and cannot be obtained by (3.23) for suitable choice of B and Bkl.
Said in a more free language, Theorem 3.1 asserts that along a path with-
out self-intersections there exist frames locally normal for any linear connection.
The assumption for the absence of points of self-intersections is important at the
moment: at such points, if any, the coordinates {xi} given via (3.12) do not exist
and, correspondingly, our proof fails. It is easily seen, this is a general feature, not
one characterizing our particular proof: since the mapping Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is at least
two-to-one at the points of self-intersections, there do not exist normal coordinates
in their neighborhoods along Œ≥. But, if we restrict Œ≥ to any subinterval of J on
which it is injective, Theorem 3.1 is completely valid to the obtained path.
The constancy of B in (3.22) agrees with Proposition I.5.2. For, e.g., B = 1,
we obtain a particular frame locally normal along Œ≥, say {Ei}. Any other normal
frame, say {E‚Ä≤
i}, is given by E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj with (EiA)|Œ≥(J) = 0, A = [Aj
i], according
to Proposition I.5.2. Combining this with (3.22) for some B, we get A|Œ≥(J) = B.
Let us turn now our attention to (3.23). Its meaning is that in U1 we have
constructed a frame

E‚Ä≤
i|p = Aj
i(p)E
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj
		
p

which is normal along Œ≥, i.e., on
Œ≥(J)‚à©U1. By virtue of Proposition I.5.2, every frame on U1 which is normal along
Œ≥ is of the form {Cj
i E‚Ä≤
j} where C = [Cj
i ] is C1 non-degenerate matrix valued
function on U1 such that E‚Ä≤
i(C)|Œ≥(J) = 0. The holonomicity of these frames on
U1\(Œ≥(J) ‚à©U1) may be completely arbitrary (see Remark I.5.1 on page 40), even
it may change from point to point, but on Œ≥(J) ‚à©U1 part of them are holonomic
if the connection is torsion free on this set (Corollary I.5.3);18 one can check this
directly, if required, by using (3.23).
18As Œ≥(J) is 1-dimensional submanifold of M, the condition in Corollary I.5.3 is identically
satisÔ¨Åed.

3. The case along paths
99
Proposition 3.3. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be C1 regular injective path in a C2 manifold M
endowed with C1 linear connection ‚àá. There exist frames normal along the whole
path Œ≥ for ‚àá.
Proof. If it happens that Œ≥(J) lies entirely in U1, the frame normal along Œ≥ con-
structed above is global, i.e., deÔ¨Åned on the whole set Œ≥(J). But this may not
be the case. Generally, we can only build an open cover {JŒ±
1 |Œ± ‚ààA} of J and
neighborhoods U Œ±
1 ‚äÉŒ≥(JŒ±
1 ) on which frames {EŒ±
i } normal along Œ≥ exist. From
these frames can be constructed global frames {Ei}, normal along Œ≥, as follows.
If for s ‚ààJ exists a unique Œ± ‚ààA with JŒ±
1 ‚àãs, we put Ei|Œ≥(s) = EŒ±
i |Œ≥(s); if the
set Ps := {Œ±|Œ± ‚ààA, Œ≥(s) ‚ààŒ≥(JŒ±
1 )} consists of more than one element, we choose
some Œ≤ ‚ààPs and put Ei|Œ≥(s) = EŒ≤
i |Œ≥(s).
‚ñ°
Generally the frames {Ei} will not be diÔ¨Äerentiable, or even not continuous,
in the regions of intersection of two or more neighborhoods U Œ±
1 . Since on every
U Œ±
1 Theorem 3.1 gives a complete description of the frames (locally) normal along
Œ≥, we can combine this with the just described construction of a frame along the
whole path Œ≥ to obtain a full description of all frames globally normal along Œ≥.
At that moment, without any eÔ¨Äort, we can make one generalization by
partially omitting the assumption of the lack of self-intersection points of Œ≥.
Theorem 3.2. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be locally injective C1 regular path in a C2 manifold
M with C0 linear connection ‚àá. There exists (global, on Œ≥(J)) frames normal
along the whole path Œ≥ for ‚àá. Locally these frames are of class C1 but globally
they need not to be such. The frames are (locally) holonomic iÔ¨Ä‚àáis torsionless
on Œ≥(J).
Proof. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be locally injective path, i.e., for every s ‚ààJ there is a
subinterval J‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ such that the restricted path Œ≥|J‚Ä≤ : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM is injective (without
self-intersections). Let JI := {s|s ‚ààJ, Œ≥(s) is self-intersection point} ‚äÇJ. From
our assumption follows that JI has no condensation points. Hence, if JI Ã∏= ‚àÖ, for
every s ‚ààJ there are three possibilities: (i) there exist s‚Ä≤, s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ààJI, s‚Ä≤ < s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ such
that s‚Ä≤ < s ‚â§s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤; (ii) there is s‚Ä≤ ‚ààJI such that s ‚â§s‚Ä≤ and if s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ààJI, then s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚â•s‚Ä≤;
(iii) there is s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ààJI such that s > s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ and if s‚Ä≤ ‚ààJI, then s‚Ä≤ ‚â§s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. Therefore, in any
case, for s ‚ààJ there exists a maximal (in J) interval Js ‚äÜJ containing s and such
that Js ‚à©JI is the empty set or consists of only one element; in the above notation,
we, respectively, have Js = {s1|s1 ‚ààJ, s‚Ä≤ < s1 ‚â§s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤}, Js = {s2|s2 ‚ààJ, s2 ‚â§s‚Ä≤},
Js = {s3|s3 ‚ààJ, s3 > s‚Ä≤‚Ä≤}. Evidently, Js = Jt iÔ¨Äs ‚ààJt or t ‚ààJs. Therefore J can
be represented as J = 
Œª‚ààŒõ JŒª where Œõ Ã∏= ‚àÖfor JI Ã∏= ‚àÖand the intervals JŒª are
such that JŒª ‚à©JI is the empty set or contains only one element and if s ‚ààJŒª, then
JŒª = Js. Consequently, the above construction of a global frame normal along a
path without self-intersections is applicable to every restricted path Œ≥|JŒª, viz., for
every Œª ‚ààŒõ, along Œ≥|JŒª there is a (global) normal frame {EŒª
i }. At the end, for
every p ‚ààŒ≥(J) we deÔ¨Åne a basis {Ei|p} such that Ei|p = EŒª
i |p if p ‚ààŒ≥(JŒª) for
some (unique) Œª ‚ààŒõ. The bases {Ei|p|p ‚ààŒ≥(J)} form a frame along the whole

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
path Œ≥ which is normal by construction. Obviously, any global frame normal along
the whole path Œ≥ can be obtained in this way.
‚ñ°
Notice, all frames normal along Œ≥ can be constructed in the pointed way or
from a single such frame according to the rule reÔ¨Çected in Proposition I.5.2.
Now we turn our attention to the coordinates normal along a given path
which, as we know from Proposition I.5.4, could exist only for connections that
are torsion free along Œ≥. Our main result is formulated below as Theorem 3.3 on
page 103 and the reader who is not interested in its proof and the construction of
coordinates (locally) normal along Œ≥ can skip the text till it.
Let M be a C3 manifold endowed with symmetric linear connection and
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be a regular C1 path without self-intersections in it. The problem is to
be found coordinates {zi} (locally) normal along Œ≥. Such coordinates exist due to
the symmetry of the connection and Corollary 3.1.
We start with the already employed chart (U1, x) with coordinate functions
xi given by (3.12). Let (Uz, z) be a chart with Uz‚à©U1 ‚äÉŒ≥(J1). Since the transition
functions z‚àí1 ‚ó¶x and x‚àí1 ‚ó¶z on Uz ‚à©U1 are of class C3, for p ‚ààUz ‚à©U1, we can
write the expansion (cf. (2.7))
zi(p) = zi(p0)+ai
j(p0)[xj(p)‚àíxj(p0)]+ai
jk(p)[xj(p)‚àíxj(p0)][xk(p)‚àíxk(p0)].
(3.24)
Here: p = Œ∑(s, t), p0 = Œ≥(x1(p)) = Œ∑(s, t0) = Œ≥(s), ai
j : Œ≥(J1) ‚ÜíR are C1 functions,
and ai
jk : Uz ‚à©U1 ‚ÜíR are of class C1 and together with their partial derivatives
they are bounded. Now we invert the situation: we shall try to Ô¨Ånd ai

such that the functions zi given by (3.24) generate a normal frame {E‚Ä≤

19The idea is to restrict a frame normal along Œ≥ to Œ≥(J) and then to extend the resulting
frame, deÔ¨Åned solely on Œ≥(J), in a neighborhood of Œ≥(J) in a holonomic way. (For a general
result regarding such extensions ‚Äì see Lemma III.10.1 on page 194.)

3. The case along paths

where ai ‚ààR are constants representing the coordinates of Œ≥(s0) in {zi}. Therefore,
by virtue of (3.22) and (3.24), the looked for functions zi have the form

where p0 = Œ≥(x1(p)) and ai
jk : U1 ‚ÜíR are C1 functions which together with their
partial derivatives are bounded on U1. Notice, in (3.25) the terms with j, k = 1
vanish as x1(p) = x1(p0) = s. Since the Jacobian of the change {xi} ‚Üí{zi} along

every s ‚ààJ1, there is a neighborhood Uz ‚äÜU1 of Œ≥(J), Uz ‚äÉŒ≥(J), such that
(Uz, z) is a chart of M with coordinate functions zi.
At the moment we can not assert that the chart (Uz, z) is normal along Œ≥:
we proved that

Œ≥(J1) = E‚Ä≤

is normal on Œ≥(J1), but from here the
conclusion can be made that every coordinate system {zi} normal along Œ≥ has the
form (3.25). We shall try to choose the functions ai
jk : Uz ‚ÜíR so that to make
{zi} normal coordinates system. For this purpose, the equation (I.5.4‚Ä≤) on page 41

‚àÇ2zi
‚àÇxjxk is symmetric in j and k (the manifold is of class C3). From here
an immediate observation follows: normal along Œ≥ coordinates (may) exist only
for symmetric (torsionless) along Œ≥ connections. This is in a full agreement with
Corollary I.5.3. Correspondingly, below we deal with the symmetric case as until
now the symmetry of the connection was not used.

d
dsA‚àí1 = ‚àíA‚àí1 dA
ds A‚àí1 = A‚àí1Œì1 on Œ≥(J), where
equation (3.16a) was used, the substitution of the above equalities into (3.26‚Ä≤)
results in

As (Œì1)n
m := Œìn
m1 = Œìn
1m, the Ô¨Årst of these equalities is an identity. This reÔ¨Çects
the vanishment of the terms with j, k = 1 in (3.25). The second equation expresses
ai
(jk) along Œ≥ through known quantities. For p ‚ààU1\Œ≥(J1), the values of ai
(jk)(p)
can not be determined from (3.26), so they are left completely arbitrary from the
requirement {zi} to be normal along Œ≥. Since we supposed M to be of class C3,
there are C0 bounded functions ai
jkl(p): Uz ‚ÜíR such that
ai
jk(p) = ai
jk(p0) + ai
jkl(p)[xl(p) ‚àíxl(p0)]
where p = x‚àí1(s, t) ‚ààUz ‚äÜU1 and p0 = Œ≥(s) = x‚àí1(s, t0). Inserting this expan-
sion in (3.25) and using the above ones for ai

p = x‚àí1(s, t) ‚ààU1,
p0 = x‚àí1(s, t0) = Œ≥(s),
(3.28)
B is constant non-degenerate matrix, and Y and x are deÔ¨Åned via (3.17) and (3.12),
respectively. Recall, the coordinates {xi} have been deÔ¨Åned via (3.12).
In this way, after long and tedious computation, we have almost proved the
following theorem.

3. The case along paths
103
Theorem 3.3. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be a regular C1 path without self-intersections in a C3
manifold endowed with C0 symmetric linear connection. For every s0 ‚ààJ, there
exist an interval J1 ‚äÜJ containing s0 and chart (Uz, z) such that Œ≥(J1) ‚äÇUz and
the associated with it local coordinates {zi} are normal along Œ≥, or, more precisely,
on Œ≥(J1). All such local coordinates, which are normal along Œ≥ in Uz, are given
via (3.27).
Remark 3.13. The theorem remains true if Œ≥ is Ô¨Åxed and the connection is sym-
metric only on Œ≥(J), i.e., for a Ô¨Åxed path the symmetry on the whole manifold is
not necessary, it is required only along Œ≥.
Proof. Since in the derivation of (3.27) the point s0 ‚ààJ was completely arbitrary,
the theorem is proved when J is an open R-interval. If J is closed from one or
both ends, one should proceed exactly as was pointed before the formulation of
Theorem 3.1 (see page 97). Take some regular C1 path Œ≥‚Ä≤ : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM without self-
intersections such that J‚Ä≤ ‚äÉJ is open, Œ≥‚Ä≤|J = Œ≥ and the tangent vectors to Œ≥‚Ä≤ and
Œ≥ coincide on J (at the end point(s) ÀôŒ≥ is deÔ¨Åned as one-sided derivative). Since
for Œ≥‚Ä≤ the assertions of the theorem are valid, the restriction of them to Œ≥, i.e., to
J ‚äÇJ‚Ä≤, completes the proof.
‚ñ°
Remark 3.14. The assumption of absence of self-intersection points is important.
If such points exist, at them the theorem fails as the mapping Œ≥ : s ‚ÜíŒ≥(s) is at
least two-to-one at them and in no way the parameter s ‚ààJ can be taken as one
of the local coordinates in their neighborhood. Generally, normal frames can be
introduced on any piece of Œ≥ without self-intersections, but at these points, if any,
the normal coordinates can not be joint smoothly.
Remark 3.15. If we have started with some Ô¨Åxed i0 Ã∏= 1 for which ÀôŒ≥i0
y (s0) Ã∏= 0
instead of our choice ÀôŒ≥1
y(s0) Ã∏= 0, the result will be given again via (3.27) and (3.28)
in which the index 1 (not in the power ‚àí1 of A‚àí1!) must be replaced with i0.
Correspondingly, the terms with j, k = i0 will vanish.
Corollary 3.2. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be regular C1 path without self-intersections in a C3
manifold endowed with C0 symmetric linear connection. Let {Ei} be a frame on
U, with U ‚à©Œ≥(J) Ã∏= ‚àÖ, normal along Œ≥|J1 for some subinterval J1 ‚äÜJ. Then all
frames {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} normal along Œ≥|J1 are such that
A(p) = B + Bkl(p)[xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)][xl(p) ‚àíxl(p0)]
(3.29)
for a constant matrix B and C1 matrix-valued functions Bkl which together with
their partial derivatives are bounded on U. Besides, the normal holonomic frames
{E‚Ä≤
i} are such that E‚Ä≤
i =
‚àÇ
‚àÇzi , where the coordinates zi are normal along Œ≥|J1 and
zi(p) = ai + Œ¥i
1[x1(p) ‚àís0] + [xi(p) ‚àíxi(p0)]
+ ai
jkl(p)[xj(p) ‚àíxj(p0)][xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)][xl(p) ‚àíxl(p0)].
(3.30)
Proof. Apply Theorems 3.1 and 3.3 for Œìi
jk ‚ó¶Œ≥|J1 = 0 (and hence Y (s, s0; ‚àíŒì1) =
1) and A ‚ó¶Œ≥|J1 = 1 as {xi} and

Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

are normal on Œ≥(J1).

104
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
Exercise 3.2. Prove Corollary 3.2 by applying only Theorem 3.1. Hint: use (3.23)
and follow the scheme outlined in Remark 2.1.
Example 3.2. We want to emphasize once again that the coordinates normal along
a path are local by their essence. Globally, i.e., on the whole path, they exist only
as an exception. Such a rare case is when the path Œ≥ is a geodesic lying entirely
in a normal neighborhood in which Riemannian coordinates exist and their origin
lies on the given geodesic path. In this case, taking the Riemannian coordinates
for {yi}, the equation of Œ≥ is (see Section I.6) Œ≥i(s) = (yi ‚ó¶Œ≥)(s) = Xi(s‚àís0) with
X = ÀôŒ≥(s0) Ã∏= 0. Letting X1 Ã∏= 0, we get ÀôŒ≥1(s) Ã∏= 0, s ‚ààJ and J1 = J which results
in Œ≥(J) ‚ààU1 = U, and, at the end, that {zi} are deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood of
Œ≥(J), i.e., {zi} are globally normal along Œ≥.
Example 3.3. Now we can look back on the Fermi coordinates constructed in
the previous subsection. At Ô¨Årst, choose the initial coordinates {yi} as pointed in
Remark 3.1 on page 87. Then, comparing (3.2) with (3.24) or (3.4) with (3.27), we
see that these particular coordinates correspond along a given path to the choice
Œ≤s(t) = Œ∑(s,ÀÜt) = expŒ≥(s),X(t ‚àít0), where one of the components of ÀÜt is equal to
t ‚ààJX, the others being constants, i.e., the paths Œ≤s : JX ‚ÜíM are geodesics.
Besides, in the case of Fermi coordinates, by virtue of the assumption that all
structures are of class C‚àû, the appearing in (3.27) functions are expanded into
power series with respect to xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0) = tk ‚àítk
0 = (t ‚àít0)Œ¥k
i0 for some Ô¨Åxed
i0. (Note, the matrix A has completely diÔ¨Äerent meanings in (3.27) and in (3.2)
or (3.4)!)
4.
The case in a neighborhood
The Ô¨Çat linear connections are usually associated with the path-independence of
the parallel transport assigned to them (see p. 29 and especially Remark I.3.5)
rather than with the normal coordinates or frames [8, ¬ß 2.6 (iii)], [11, Chapter II,
¬ß 9 and Chapter V, ¬ß 4], [1, Section 6.10].1 Below we shall see that these are
diÔ¨Äerent sides of one and the same problem.
Theorem 4.1. Let M be a C3 manifold endowed with C1 linear connection ‚àáand
U be (dim M)-dimensional submanifold of M. Frames normal for ‚àáon U exist if
and only if ‚àáis Ô¨Çat on U, R|U = 0.
Remark 4.1. Notice, the theorem covers equally well the cases without and with
torsion.
Remark 4.2. In particular, the submanifold U can be a neighborhood, possibly
coordinate one, or the whole manifold M.
1For the special case of Riemannian manifolds, see [12, p. 286 and p. 303] where, equivalently,
a manifold is called (locally) Ô¨Çat if it is (locally) isometric to Rn with a metric a, b ‚Üí
i Œµiaibi
for a, b ‚ààRn and Œµi = ¬±1.

4. The case in a neighborhood
105
Proof. Let {Ei} be a frame on U. To save some writing, we introduce the matrices
Œìk and Rkl of, respectively, the coeÔ¨Écients and curvature of ‚àá:2
Œìk :=

Œìi
jk
dim M
i,j=1 ,
Rkl :=

Ri
jkl
dim M
i,j=1 .
In this notation, equation (I.3.13) reads
Rkl = ‚àí2Œì[k,l] + 2Œì[kŒìl] ‚àíCm
klŒìm
(4.1)
where Œìk,l := El(Œìk) and Cm
kl are deÔ¨Åned via (I.3.15).
Necessity. If ‚àáadmits a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} normal on U, there is a non-degenerate
C1 matrix-valued function A = [Aj
i] such that E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj and (see (I.5.4))
Œìk = ‚àíA,kA‚àí1
on U,
k = 1, . . . , dim U = dim M.
(4.2)
The substitution of this equality into (4.1) results in R|U = 0, due to (I.3.15).
Sufficiency. As we know from the considerations in Section I.5 (p. 39), a
connection ‚àáadmits normal frames iÔ¨Ä(I.5.4) has solutions with respect to the
matrix A in a given frame {Ei}. Rewriting (I.5.4) in the form
Ek(A)|p = ‚àíŒìk(p)A(p),
p ‚ààU,
(4.3)
we shall Ô¨Ånd its general solution, under the condition R|U = 0, by applying the
following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. Let N be a manifold and there be given C1 matrix-valued functions
Za : N ‚ÜíGL(m, K), a = 1, . . . , dim N, GL(m, K) being the group of m √ó m
nondegenerate matrices on K for some m ‚ààN. Suppose {ea|a = 1, . . . , dim N} is
a (global ) frame on N and consider the initial-value problem
ea(Y )|q = Za(q)Y,
q ‚ààN, a = 1, . . . , dim N,
(4.4a)
Y |q=q0 = 1
(4.4b)
with respect to the m √ó m matrix-valued function Y on N. Here q0 ‚ààN is Ô¨Åxed
and 1 = 1m. Then:
(i) The integrability conditions for (4.4a) are
ea(eb(Y )) ‚àíeb(ea(Y )) = cd
abed(Y ),
a, b, d = 1, . . . , dim N
(4.5)
where [ea, eb]‚àí=: cd
abed, or, equivalently,
Rab(Z1, . . . , Zdim N) := eb(Za) ‚àíea(Zb) + ZaZb ‚àíZbZa + cd
abZd = 0, (4.6)
i.e., (4.4a) has solutions with respect to Y : N ‚ÜíGL(m, K) under these
conditions.
2Since the Ricci tensor will not appear in this book, the quantities Rkl can not be confused
with its components.

106
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
(ii) The initial-value problem (4.4) has a solution, which is of class C2, unique
and smoothly depends on its arguments, if and only if the integrability con-
ditions (4.6) are valid. This solution will be denoted by
Y = Y (q, q0; Z1, . . . , Zdim N).
Remark 4.3. In this section, Lemma 4.1 will be used only for N = U, U being
a neighborhood in M, resp. dim N = m = dim M. We formulate it in the above
general form because we shall need this generalization further. The proofs in the
both cases are practically identical.
Remark 4.4. The choice N = J, dim N = 1, q = s ‚ààJ, e1 =
d
ds, and q0 = s0 ‚ààJ
returns us to Lemma 3.2. Moreover, for any N with dim N = 1 the integrability
conditions are identically valid, so the problem (4.4) always has a unique smooth
solution in the one-dimensional case.
Remark 4.5. It is easily seen that the general solution of the matrix system of
diÔ¨Äerential equations
ea(X) = ZaX
(4.7)
with X ‚ààGL(m, K) is
X = Y (q, q0; Z1, . . . , Zdim N)
(4.8)
for arbitrary q ‚ààN, or, equivalently,
X = Y (q, q0; Z1, . . . , Zdim N)X0
(4.9)
for Ô¨Åxed q0 ‚ààN and arbitrary X0 ‚ààGL(m, K). Also, the particular solution
satisfying the initial condition
X|q=q0 = X0
(4.10)
for some q0 ‚ààN and X0 ‚ààGL(m, K) is given by (4.9).
Proof of Lemma 4.1.
Let (V, z) be a chart of N and ea|V = Db

C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function D = [Db

abed(Y ), which is obtainable by di-
rect calculation (cf. equations (I.8.1)‚Äì(I.8.3) in Section I.8), these conditions are
equivalent to (4.5).
Expressing the derivatives ea(Y ) from (4.4a) and inserting the results into
equation (4.5), we get (4.6) (cf. [34, Chapter VI, equation (1.4)]). Reversing this
process, we can derive (4.5) from (4.6). Hence (4.5) and (4.6) are equivalent (pro-
vided (4.4a) is valid, as we supposed).
The second part of the lemma‚Äôs assertion is a corollary of its Ô¨Årst part and the
corresponding theorems of existence and uniqueness in the theory of diÔ¨Äerential
equations; see, e.g., [34, Chapter VI, Theorem 6.1].

4. The case in a neighborhood
107
Let us return now to equation (4.3). It corresponds to (4.7) with N = U,
dim N = m = dim M, ei = Ei, and Zk = ‚àíŒìk. So, the integrability conditions
for (4.3) are (4.6) with Zk = ‚àíŒìk:
0 = Rkl(‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M) = ‚àí2Œì[k,l] + 2Œì[kŒìl] ‚àíCm
kl Œìm = Rkl
where (4.1) was used. These conditions are fulÔ¨Ålled due to the Ô¨Çatness of ‚àáon U,
R|U = 0. Consequently, according to Lemma 4.1 (ii) and Remark 4.5, the general
solution of (4.3) is
A(p) = Y (p, p0; ‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M)B
(4.11)
where p ‚ààU, p0 ‚ààU is Ô¨Åxed point, B is non-degenerate constant matrix in
GL(dim M, K), and Y is the unique solution of the initial-value problem
Ei(Y )|p = ‚àíŒìi(p)Y,
Y |p=p0 = 1dim M.
(4.12)
Thereof, by construction, the frames {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj}, with the matrices A given
via (4.11), are normal on U.
‚ñ°
Corollary 4.1. A C3 manifold with C1 linear connection admits a (global ) normal
frame on it iÔ¨Äit is Ô¨Çat.
Proof. See Theorem 4.1.
‚ñ°
Theorem 4.2. Given a C1 linear connection on C3 manifold M. If the connection
is Ô¨Çat on a (dim M)-dimensional submanifold U of M, then all frames normal on
U for it are {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} where {Ei} is arbitrarily chosen frame on U and A is
given by (4.11) in which p ‚ààU, p0 ‚ààU is Ô¨Åxed, Œìk are the connection‚Äôs matrices
in {Ei}, and B is constant non-degenerate matrix.
Proof. See the proof of the suÔ¨Éciency of Theorem 4.1 in which is proved that (4.11)
is the general solution of (I.5.4) in U.
‚ñ°
Remark 4.6. The constancy of B in (4.11) agrees with Proposition I.5.2 and Corol-
lary I.5.1.
Corollary 4.2. Let M be C3 manifold endowed with a symmetric Ô¨Çat linear connec-
tion. On every (dim M)-dimensional submanifold of M, in particular on an open
set in M or on the whole M, exist normal frames whose general form is {E‚Ä≤
i =
Aj
iEj} with A = [Aj
i] given by (4.11) and {Ei} being an arbitrary frame on it.
Proof. See Theorem 4.2
‚ñ°
Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 give a complete description of the frames normal on
submanifolds of maximum dimensionality, in particular on neighborhoods or on the
whole manifold. On their base an analogous description for the normal coordinates
can be given.

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
Let M be C3 manifold endowed with C1 symmetric (torsionless) linear con-
nection ‚àáwhich is Ô¨Çat in the domain U of some local chart (U, x) of M, R|U = 0.
The problem is to be described all local coordinates normal on U for ‚àá. Its general
solution is given by the following result.
Theorem 4.3. Given a C3 manifold M endowed with C1 linear connection. If (U, x)
is a chart of M on whose domain the connection is Ô¨Çat and torsionless, R|U = 0
and T |U = 0, then on U exist coordinates {x‚Ä≤ i} normal for the connection given.
All such coordinates are obtained from {xi} according to equation (4.14) below.
Proof. According to Proposition I.5.3 and Theorem 4.1, coordinates {x‚Ä≤ i} normal
on U exist and they locally generate all frames normal on U. By Corollary I.5.2 and
Theorem 4.2, all coordinates normal on U are such that
‚àÇ
‚àÇx‚Ä≤ i = Aj
i Ej with A =
[Aj
i] given by (4.11) and {Ei} being arbitrary frame on U. Below, for simplicity, we
choose Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi . So {x‚Ä≤ i} must be such that
‚àÇ
‚àÇx‚Ä≤ i = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj with A given by (4.11).
Consequently they must be solutions of the following system of partial diÔ¨Äerential
equations

, and B is constant non-degenerate matrix. The integrability conditions for
this system are [34, Chapter VI, ¬ß¬ß 1‚Äì6]

the symmetry of the connection. Hence the system (4.13) is completely integrable
and deÔ¨Ånes x‚Ä≤ i as C3 functions of xi (as A is of class C2).3 The general solution
of (4.13) can be written as
x‚Ä≤ i(p) = ai +

3The same result follows from the Poincar¬¥e Lemma [13, p. 121], [2, p. 55]: writing (4.13)

4. The case in a neighborhood
109
Here: p ‚ààU, p0 ‚ààU is Ô¨Åxed, ai ‚ààK are constants representing the coordinates of
p0 in x‚Ä≤ i, Œìk are the matrices of the connection coeÔ¨Écients in

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

, the integrals
are taken along paths lying entirely in U, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU is a C1 path such that
Œ≥(s0) = p0 and Œ≥(s) = p for some s0, s ‚ààJ, B is constant non-degenerate matrix,
and Y is the solution of (4.4) with N = U, m = dim M, and ek =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxk . i.e.,
‚àÇY
‚àÇxk = ‚àíŒìkY,
Y |p=p0 = 1,
Y = Y (p.p0; ‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M).
(4.15)
Since the connection is supposed Ô¨Çat in U, R|U = 0, it is a simple exercise to
be shown that the integrals in (4.14) and (4.14‚Ä≤) are well-deÔ¨Åned, i.e., independent
of the concrete paths, like Œ≥, lying in U along which the integration is performed.
This ends the proof of Theorem 4.3.
‚ñ°
Exercise 4.1. Show that the choice Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi in the proof of Theorem 4.3 does not
restrict the generality of our constructions. For the purpose, prove that the choice
Ei = Dj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj , with a C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function D = [Dj
i ], does
not inÔ¨Çuence the Ô¨Ånal results expressed by Theorem 4.3. (Hint: The matrix (4.11),
which is a solution of (4.3), transforms {Ei} into {E‚Ä≤
i} and Œìk, appearing in (4.3)
and (4.11), are the connection‚Äôs matrices in {Ei}; so, the particular form (and
meaning) of A and Œìk is diÔ¨Äerent for arbitrary Ei and for Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi .)
Corollary 4.3. Let M be a C3 manifold and ‚àábe a C1 Ô¨Çat torsionless linear
connection on it. On every coordinate neighborhood of M exist coordinates normal
for ‚àáwhose general form is given via (4.14).
Proof. See Theorem 4.3.
‚ñ°
Theorem 4.3 and its Corollary 4.3 give a complete description of the normal
coordinates on a C3 manifold with C1 (Ô¨Çat torsionless) linear connection.
If the manifold and the connection considered are of class C‚àû, the integral
in (4.14) (or (4.14‚Ä≤)) can be calculated explicitly in terms of the connection coeÔ¨É-
cients (in

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

) as a power series in some neighborhood of a Ô¨Åxed point p0 ‚ààU.
Indeed, in this case we can write
Y ‚àí1(p, p0; ‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M) = Y ‚àí1(p0, p0; ‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M)

The values of Y ‚àí1 and its derivatives in the right-hand side of the last equa-
tion can be evaluated by means of (4.15) as it is equivalent to

(4.16b)
In fact, by successive diÔ¨Äerentiation of equation (4.16a), we get
‚àÇnY ‚àí1

(4.17)
Hence the expansion of Y ‚àí1 takes the form

5. The case on arbitrary submanifolds
111
Now we want to say a few words on the links between the normal frames/coor-
dinates and parallel transport on manifolds with Ô¨Çat linear connection. (For sim-
plicity and brevity, we consider only the global case below.)
It is a classical result that the parallel transport is (locally) path-independent
iÔ¨Äthe manifold M (or the connection) is (locally) Ô¨Çat [3,8,11]. Sometimes for such
manifolds is said that they possess teleparallelism or absolute parallelism [19,
p. 142], admit distant parallelism [55], or that they are parallelizable [28, p. 68].
A parallelization of M is called the choice of a covariantly-constant frame {Ei}
on M, i.e., ‚àáXEi = 0 for all X ‚ààX(M). Hence {Ei} is a parallelization of M iÔ¨Ä
‚àáEjEi = 0 which is equivalent to Œìk
ij = 0 (see (I.3.1)), i.e., iÔ¨Ä{Ei} is normal.
Thereof, the parallelization is simply a concrete choice of some normal frame and
the manifold is parallelizable iÔ¨Äit admits normal frames or, equivalently (see
Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.1), iÔ¨Äit is Ô¨Çat. The following result, which agrees
with Proposition I.5.5, expresses the same in another form.
Proposition 4.1. A C3 manifold endowed with C1 linear connection admits (global )
normal frames if and only if the parallel transport associated to the connection is
path-independent.
Proof. If M admits a normal frame {Ei}, in it the parallel transport is path-
independent according to Proposition I.5.5. Conversely, let the parallel transport
be path-independent and {E0
i } be a Ô¨Åxed basis at an arbitrarily chosen point
p ‚ààM. DeÔ¨Åne a frame {Ei} on M such that E0
i |p ‚ÜíEi|q is the result of the
parallel transport of E0
i from p to q for all q ‚ààM. By construction, this frame is
path-independent and satisÔ¨Åes the equation (see (I.3.18)) ‚àáÀôŒ≥Ei = 0 for every path
Œ≥ joining p and q. So, choosing Œ≥ such that at q the tangent vector ÀôŒ≥ coincides
with Ej|q, we get 0 = (‚àáEjEi)|q = (Œìk
ijEk)|q, i.e., Œìk
ij(q) = 0, q ‚ààM which
means that {Ei} is normal on M.
‚ñ°
Remark 4.7. A trivial consequence of Corollary 4.1 and Proposition 4.1 is that
the parallel transport is path-independent iÔ¨Äthe generating it connection is Ô¨Çat.
Conversely, if this result is proved by another way [3,11,28], from Proposition 4.1
immediately follows Corollary 4.1.
5.
The case on arbitrary submanifolds
The problem for existence of coordinates normal on a submanifold of dimension
higher than one was Ô¨Årst posed by J. A. Schouten and D. J. Struik in 1935 [43,
p. 106]. They showed that if N is n-dimensional submanifold of m-dimensional,
m ‚â•n, manifold M endowed with symmetric linear connection, then on N exist
(in our terminology) normal coordinates provided on N exist n linearly indepen-
dent covariantly constant (with respect to every vector Ô¨Åeld) vector Ô¨Åelds. In our
notation this is translated as: on N exist normal coordinates if on it the connec-
tion admits normal frames. The same result is quoted in [19, p. 169] where a new

112
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
problem is put (in our terminology): if on N, considered as a manifold, a (global)
normal frame exists, are there coordinates on M which are normal on N consid-
ered as a submanifold of M? This problem was completely solved (for symmetric
linear connections) by L. O‚ÄôRaifeartaigh in 1958 [55].
5.1.
Conventional method
In this subsection, we shall review (in our notation) and partially generalize the
results of the paper [55]. Its idea [55, pp. 18 and 21, paragraphs 1 and 3] is
quite simple and analogous to the one of the construction of Fermi coordinates
(Subsection 3.1). If N is an n-dimensional submanifold of the m-dimensional,
m ‚â•n, manifold M, in a neighborhood of N the manifold M can be represented
(locally) as a direct sum of suitable (m ‚àín)-dimensional submanifolds Lq, one
for each q ‚ààN, such that Lq is (m ‚àín)-dimensional normal neighborhood of q
(see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.6) and for every p in the mentioned neighborhood of N there is
unique p0 ‚ààN such that Lp0 ‚àãp. If on N exist normal coordinates, such are the
coordinates (œï1, . . . , œïn, Œæ1, . . . , Œæm‚àín) where œï1(p), . . . , œïn(p) are the coordinates
of p0 in N (‚Äòconsidered as a Ô¨Çat space‚Äô) and Œæ1(p), . . . , Œæm‚àín(p) are the Riemannian
normal coordinates of p with respect to p0 in Lp0. Special cases of this construction,
corresponding to n = 0, 1, m, were investigated in Sections 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
As we shall see, for n ‚â•2 (if m ‚â•2) coordinates normal on N exist iÔ¨Äsome
conditions, derived below, are satisÔ¨Åed.
Now the rigorous statement and solution of the problem outlined are in order.
Let M be C3 manifold provided with C1 torsionless linear connection and N
be submanifold of M (see Subsection I.2.1, p. 7). The problem, we are going to
investigate, is to Ô¨Ånd conditions under which on M exist local coordinates normal
on (an open subset of) N and, when they are valid, to construct a particular
example of such coordinates.
Lemma 5.1. Let N be a submanifold of a C3 manifold M endowed with C1 linear
connection ‚àá. The parallel transport with respect to ‚àáalong paths lying entirely
in N is path-independent if and only if
(R(X, Y ))|q = 0,
Xq, Yq ‚ààTq(N),
q ‚ààN
(5.1)
where R is the curvature tensor of ‚àáin M and X and Y are vector Ô¨Åelds tangent
to N (as a manifold ), X, Y ‚ààX(N).
Remark 5.1. This lemma is true for arbitrary linear connections, without or with
torsion,1 and for N = M it reduces to the wide-known result that the parallel
transport is path-independent only for Ô¨Çat linear connections. Note, from (5.1)
one can not conclude R|N = 0 unless dim N = dim M. (In this context, see
Remark IV.10.2 on page 276 concerning the same problem on vector bundles.)
1In [55] it is proved in the torsionless case.

5. The case on arbitrary submanifolds
113
Remark 5.2. The equation (5.1) does not concern separately M, N, or ‚àá. It
involves simultaneously all of them: the manifold M is a carrier of ‚àáand a set
containing N and N is the set on which the parallel transport and the curvature
of ‚àáare restricted.
Proof. Let (U, x) be a chart of M with ¬ØU := U ‚à©N Ã∏= ‚àÖ. By deÔ¨Ånition of a
submanifold (page 7), the pair ( ¬ØU, ¬Øx) with ¬Øx(q) := (x1(q), . . . , xdim N(q)), q ‚ààN,
is a chart of N with {¬Øxa := xa| ¬ØU|a = 1, . . . , dim N} as associated coordinate
system. So

Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN and Z ‚ààX1(N) ‚äÜX1(M) be C1 vector Ô¨Åeld tangent to M
over N and parallel along Œ≥, viz. ÀôŒ≥(s) ‚ààTŒ≥(s)(N) and ZŒ≥(s) ‚ààTŒ≥(s)(M) for s ‚ààJ

in N, we have ÀôŒ≥(s) ‚ààTŒ≥(s)(N) and hence ÀôŒ≥j = 0 for j > dim N. The parallel
transport in N is path-independent if2 there is a vector Ô¨Åeld Z ‚ààX(N) ‚äÜX(M)
such that ‚àáÀôŒ≥Z = 0 for every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN, which is equivalent to the existence

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
Remark 5.3. Using the notation of (4.6), we can rewrite (5.1‚Ä≤) in more compact
matrix form
Rab(‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim N)|p = 0,
a, b = 1, . . . , dim N,
(5.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤)
which is valid in every chart of N.
Proposition 5.1. Let N be a submanifold of a C3 manifold M provided with C1
linear connection ‚àá. If the connection ‚àáadmits frames normal on N, then (5.1)
holds, i.e., equation (5.1) is a necessary condition for the existence of frames nor-
mal on N.
Proof. If ‚àáadmits a normal frame on N, by Proposition I.5.5 the parallel transport
in N along paths in N is path-independent and, hence, according to Lemma 5.1,
equation (5.1) holds.
‚ñ°
We will prove in the next subsection (p. 120) that the condition (5.1) is also
suÔ¨Écient for the existence to frames normal on N for arbitrary, torsionless or
not, linear connections. Below, following [55], we will prove only the existence of
particular coordinates which are normal on N in the torsionless case provided (5.1)
is valid.
Proposition 5.2. Given a submanifold N of a C3 manifold M endowed with C1
torsionless linear connection ‚àáfor which equation (5.1) holds. Then ‚àáadmits
frames and coordinates locally normal on N, i.e., for every q ‚ààN there exists a
chart (U 0, y) of M with q in its domain, U 0 ‚àãq, such that the associated with it
coordinate system {yi} is normal on ¬ØU := U 0 ‚à©N. A particular example of such
coordinate is provided by equation (5.5) below.
Proof. Let ‚àábe torsion free, (U, x) be a chart of M such that ¬ØU := U ‚à©N Ã∏= ‚àÖ
and q0 ‚àà¬ØU. So ( ¬ØU, ¬Øx) with ¬Øxa = xa|N, a = 1, . . . , dim N, is a chart of N in
a neighborhood of q0. Let {E0
i } be a basis in Tq0(M) such that E0
a ‚ààTq0(N),
a = 1, . . . , dim N. Consequently, the (dim M ‚àídim N)-dimensional space spanned
by {E0
i |i > dim N} does not contained vectors tangent to N except the zero
vector.3
Suppose the equation (5.1) holds. Since the parallel transport in N along
paths lying in N is path-independent (Lemma 5.1), the frame {Ei} on N obtained
from {E0
i } by parallel translation from q0 to every point q ‚ààN along paths lying
entirely in N is uniquely deÔ¨Åned: ‚àáXEi = 0, with X being tangent to N vector
Ô¨Åeld, and Ei|q0 = E0
i .
By means of the frame {Ei}, we shall deÔ¨Åne the looked for coordinates. For
the purpose, we write the expansion Ei = Dj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj . The non-degenerate matrix-
valued function D = [Di
j] can be obtained from the parallel character of {Ei}
on N. Since ‚àáXEi = 0 for all vector Ô¨Åelds X tangent to N, for X =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxa ,
3For example, we can put E0
i =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
		
q0; see the deÔ¨Ånition of a submanifold on page 7.

As the integrability conditions for the last equation are (5.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤), which are equivalent
to (5.1), in turn supposed to be valid, by Lemma 4.1 with m = dim M, we have
(see (4.4))
D(q) = Y (q, q0; ‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim N)D0
(5.2)
where the constant non-degenerate dim M √ódim M matrix D0 is such that Ei|q0 =

Now we shall deÔ¨Åne new coordinates {yi} on the domain of the chart (U, x).
At Ô¨Årst we deÔ¨Åne them only on ¬ØU := U ‚à©N (cf. (3.25)) by

0 < 1 ‚àíŒµ < |J(q)| < 1 + Œµ for q ‚ààUŒµ. Thus J(q) Ã∏= 0 for q ‚ààUŒµ.

for q ‚àà¬ØUq0. So, {E1, . . . , Edim M} is a frame holonomic on ¬ØUq0 and it is generated
by the coordinate system {¬Øya} of the chart ( ¬ØUq0, y) of N.
At this point we shall need the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2. Let N be submanifold of a C3 manifold M endowed with C1 torsionless
linear connection whose curvature tensor satisÔ¨Åes (5.1). Every parallel frame {Ei}
deÔ¨Åned on N (resp. in a neighborhood of N) can locally be expanded (resp. be
redeÔ¨Åned ) outside N in a holonomic way, i.e., if the vector Ô¨Åelds Ei are parallel
on N, for every point p0 ‚ààN, there is a chart (V, z) of M with V ‚àãp0 such
that ¬ØV := V ‚à©N is a coordinate neighborhood in N and the associated with it
coordinate system {zi} generates {Ei} on ¬ØV : Ei|q =
‚àÇ
‚àÇzi
		
q, q ‚àà¬ØV . If dim N = 0
or if N is real and dim N = 1, the assertion is valid for any frame, parallel or not,
regardless of the existence of some connection on M, i.e., in the zero- and real
one-dimensional cases any frame deÔ¨Åned solely at a single point or along a given
path can be (locally) generated by some local coordinates.
Remark 5.4. From this lemma, generally, does not follow that any (parallel) frame
is holonomic on N! This is valid if dim N = dim M. The meaning of the lemma
is that any Ô¨Åeld of bases parallel on N, with respect to path-independent parallel
transport generated by a linear connection, can be generated (locally) by some
local coordinate system.
Remark 5.5. For dim N = 1, when (5.1) is identically valid, and K = R this lemma
reduces to [76, Lemma 4.1]. See also Lemma III.10.1 on page 194.
Remark 5.6. The lemma means that any continuous frame deÔ¨Åned solely on a
submanifold and parallel on it can locally be extended to a holonomic frame on
its neighborhood provided equation (5.1) holds. Of course, if required, such an
extension can be done in an anholonomic way too (provided dim N < dim M).
Consequently, the holonomicity problem for a (parallel) frame deÔ¨Åned only on N
(under the condition (5.1)) depends on the way this frame is extended outside the
set N.
Proof of Lemma 5.2.
Let p0 ‚ààN, (U, x) be a chart of M with U ‚àãp0, and ( ¬ØU, ¬Øx)
be the associated chart of N, viz. ¬ØU := U ‚à©N, ¬Øx(q) := (x1(q), . . . , xdim N(q)) for
x(q) := (x1(q), . . . , xdim N(q), b1, . . . , bdim M‚àídim N) where q ‚àà¬ØU and the b‚Äôs are
constants in K. Let UN := {p|p ‚ààU, xa(p) = xa(q), a = 1, . . . , dim N, q ‚àà¬ØU} ‚äÜ
U. This set is a neighborhood of ¬ØU such that every p ‚ààUN has a ‚Äòprojection p0 ‚àà¬ØU
along x‚Äô: p0 := ¬Øx‚àí1(x1(p), . . . , xdim N(p)). Let the expansion Ei|q = Dj

j [xj(p) ‚àíxj(p0)]
+ f i
jk(p)[xj(p) ‚àíxj(p0)][xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)].
(5.4)
Here: p ‚ààUN, ai ‚ààK are constants, q0 ‚àà¬ØU is Ô¨Åxed, p0 is the above-deÔ¨Åned
‚Äòprojection‚Äô of p on ¬ØU, the integral is taken along some path lying entirely in ¬ØU,
and f i
jk : UN ‚ÜíK are of class C1 and they and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are
bounded on ¬ØU = UN ‚à©N. As we saw above (see (5.3) and the lines below it), the
integral in (5.4) is path-independent due to the parallel character of {Ei} on N and
the symmetry of the connection. If N is real and dim N = 1, this integral is well-
deÔ¨Åned for any initial frame {Ei}, regardless of the existence of some connection
on M.
Exercise 5.1. Prove the last assertion! (Hint: in this case, N has locally the form
Œ≥(J) where J is open R-interval and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíŒ≥(J) is a diÔ¨Äeomorphism.)
For dim N = 0, we take for p0 some point in ¬ØU and the above integral
identically vanishes. The Jacobian of the transformation {xi} ‚Üí{zi} at p0 is
J(p0) = det

p0


D‚àí1(p0)

= 1/ det(D(p0)) Ã∏= 0, ‚àûfor every p0 ‚àà¬ØU.
Consequently {zi} is a coordinate system on some neighborhood V ‚äÜUN of ¬ØU.
At last, we calculate the basic vectors of the frame

p0 ‚àà¬ØU = V ‚à©N = UN ‚à©N = U ‚à©N:

p0 = Ei|p0.
Hence the chart (V, z) with coordinates functions zi is the one we are looking for.
This conclusion ends the proof of Lemma 5.2
‚ñ°
Exercise 5.2. Prove that equation (5.4) deÔ¨Ånes the most general local coordinates
generating locally a given (parallel) frame on a submanifold. From this view-point,
the coincidence of {zi} on ¬ØU with {yi} given via (5.3) (as p = p0 for p ‚àà¬ØU) is
evident as all such coordinate can diÔ¨Äer only at points not lying in N.
Using the chart (V, z), V ‚à©N = ¬ØU, provided by Lemma 5.2, we can construct
a foliation of V ‚Äòalong‚Äô N: deÔ¨Åning an (dim M ‚àídim N)-dimensional manifolds
Vq by
Vq := {p|p ‚ààV, za(p) = za(q), a = 1, . . . , dim N},
q ‚àà¬ØU,

118

we see that

q‚àà¬ØU
Vq = V,
Vq ‚à©Vq‚Ä≤ = ‚àÖfor q Ã∏= q‚Ä≤, q, q‚Ä≤ ‚àà¬ØU,
and Vq ‚à©¬ØU = q ‚àà¬ØU.
Besides, by construction (see Lemma 5.2 and its proof), the tangent space Tp(Vq),
p ‚ààVq, does not contain vectors tangent to N; in particular, we have the direct
decomposition Tq(M) = Tq(Vq) ‚äïTq(N), q ‚àà¬ØU ‚äÜN.
Consequently, for every p ‚ààV , there is a unique point ¬Øp ‚àà¬ØU such that
p ‚ààV¬Øp.6
Now in each Vq we take a (dim M ‚àídim N)-dimensional normal neighborhood
V 0
q of q (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.6 on page 33). The union V 0 := 
q‚àà¬ØU V 0
q ‚äÜV forms
a neighborhood of ¬ØU such that, for every p ‚ààV 0 in the submanifold V 0
¬Øp , there
exists a unique geodesic Œ≤p : J ‚ÜíV¬Øp, J ‚àã0 joining ¬Øp and p in V¬Øp, i.e., more
precisely, p = exp¬Øp(tXp) = Œ≤p(t) where Œ≤p(0) = ¬Øp, ÀôŒ≤p(0) = Xp for some unique

and t ‚ààJ. Just
to prove the existence of this unique Xp corresponding to every p in a neighborhood
of ¬ØU were needed all of the considerations after (5.3). With its help, we deÔ¨Åne the
coordinates {yi} on V 0 (cf. (5.4)) by
yi(p) = ai +

(5.5)
Here: p ‚ààV 0, ai ‚ààK are constants, q0 ‚àà¬ØU is Ô¨Åxed, ¬Øp is the unique element
in ¬ØU for which V¬Øp ‚àãp, pi := xi(p), the integral is taken along some path in ¬ØU,
t is the increment of the parameter when passing from ¬Øp to p along the unique
geodesic connecting them in V¬Øp, and Xp is the tangent vector to this geodesic at ¬Øp
(corresponding to t = 0). The quantities yXi
p :=

j Xj
p are the components
of Xp in {Ei|¬Øp} and, since Xp ‚ààT¬Øp(V¬Øp), we have yXa
p = 0 for a = 1, . . . , dim N.
Since (5.5) corresponds to (5.4) with p0 = ¬Øp, xj(p) = xj(p0)+t yXj
p, f i
jk = 0,
and V = V 0, from the considerations after (5.4) in the proof of Lemma 5.2, it
follows that there exist a neighborhood U 0 ‚äÜV 0 of ¬ØU (= U 0 ‚à©N = V 0 ‚à©N =
¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ) on which the transformation {xi} ‚Üí{yi}, given via (5.5), is a well-deÔ¨Åned
diÔ¨Äeomorphism.7
Ending these long considerations, we will prove that the chart (U 0, y) of M
is normal on N, i.e., on ¬ØU = U 0 ‚à©N. Till now the chart (U, x) was complete
arbitrary. Choosing (U, x) = (U 0, y), we get

q =

q ‚àà¬ØU. Thus D| ¬ØU = 1 or Dj
i (q) = Œ¥j
i for q ‚àà¬ØU. From the parallel character of {Ei}
on N, we derive 0 = ‚àá‚àÇ/‚àÇxaEj = ‚àá‚àÇ/‚àÇxa
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj = Œìi
jaEi on ¬ØU, so that Œìi

6In [55] this assertion is mentioned and used but its rigorous proof, which is not trivial, is
only partially presented, the main details are missing.
7For another proof of this fact, see [55, pp. 21‚Äì22].

5. The case on arbitrary submanifolds
119
for a = 1, . . . , dim N. Since p ‚ààU 0 and ¬Øp ‚àà¬ØU are situated on a geodesic, the
coordinates (5.5) must satisfy the geodesic equation (I.3.23) with p for Œ≥(s), yj(p)
for Œ≥j(s), and t for s, which results in Œìi
jk(p)Xj
pXk
p = 0. Taking into account that
p is arbitrary, Œìi
jk = Œìi
kj, and Xa = 0 for a = 1, . . . , dim N as Xp ‚ààT¬Øp(V¬Øp) and
T¬Øp(V¬Øp) ‚à©T¬Øp(N) = ‚àÖ, from here we Ô¨Ånd Œìi
jk
		 ¬ØU = 0 for j, k > dim N. Combining
this with Œìi
ja
		 ¬ØU = 0 for a < dim N, we, Ô¨Ånally obtain Œìi
jk
		 ¬ØU = 0 for all values of
all indices.
Consequently the chart (U 0, y) is normal on ¬ØU, which ends the proof of
Proposition 5.2
‚ñ°
The coordinates (5.5) are direct analogue and multidimensional generaliza-
tion of the Fermi coordinates along paths without self-intersections (see Subsec-
tion 3.1), to which they reduce in the one-dimensional case. For this reason, we
propose, as in [55], to call Fermi coordinates on a submanifold this special kind of
coordinates normal on a submanifold.
It should be emphasized, the Fermi coordinates on a submanifold are local
by their nature. Generally global such coordinates, i.e., on the whole submanifold,
do not exist. But, it is almost evident, we can construct a family of overlapping
such coordinate systems whose domains form a neighborhood of the submanifold
given.
From (5.5) (see also (5.4) for xi(p) = xi(p0)+

that the basic vector Ô¨Åelds of the normal frames associated to the Fermi coordi-

on ¬ØU coincides with the initial frame {Ei} on
¬ØU. Since {Ei} is parallel by deÔ¨Ånition, so is

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇyj

. This result completely agrees
with Proposition I.5.6.
Combining Propositions 5.1 and 5.2, we obtain the following fundamental
result.
Theorem 5.1. Let N be a submanifold of a C3 manifold M endowed with C1
torsionless linear connection. There exist coordinates (in M) normal on N for
the connection given if and only if the conditions (5.1) are valid. If (5.1) holds,
the above-constructed Fermi coordinates are normal on the intersection of their
domain with N.
If M admits Fermi coordinates on its submanifold N, we can easily describe
all frames normal on N. If (U 0, y) is a chart normal on N, i.e., on ¬ØU = U 0 ‚à©N,
with {yi} being Fermi coordinates on U 0, the frame

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇyj

is, by DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.2,
normal on ¬ØU. According to Proposition I.5.2, in U 0 all frames normal on ¬ØU have
the form

Ei = Aj

‚àÇ
‚àÇyj

where the non-degenerate C2 matrix-valued function
A := [Aj
i] on U 0 is such that ‚àÇA
‚àÇyj
		 ¬ØU = 0.

120
Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
Exercise 5.3. Prove that the general form of the matrix-valued function A is

where p ‚ààU 0, B is non-degenerate C2 matrix-valued function on U 0, p0 is the
‚Äòprojection‚Äô of p on ¬ØU as deÔ¨Åned before (5.4), the matrix-valued functions Bjk on
¬ØU are of class C1, and B, ‚àÇB
‚àÇyi , and Bjk together with their partial derivatives are
bounded on ¬ØU.
According to Theorem 5.1, between the normal frames exist holonomic ones.
The full local description of all coordinates normal on a submanifold will be given
in the next subsection. In the particular case considered, they are deÔ¨Åned on U 0
and normal on ¬ØU = U 0 ‚à©N.
If we cover N with overlapping systems of Fermi coordinates (U 0
Œª, yŒª), Œª ‚àà
Œõ Ã∏= ‚àÖ, we can construct on N a global (on N) frame normal on the whole
submanifold N. Let {EŒª
i } be a frame deÔ¨Åned on U 0
Œª and normal on ¬ØUŒª = U 0
Œª ‚à©N.
If q ‚ààN is such that q ‚àà¬ØUŒª for a single Œª ‚ààŒõ, we put Ei|p := EŒª
i |p, p ‚ààU 0
Œª; if such
Œª ‚ààŒõ are more than one, we arbitrarily choose some ¬µ ‚ààŒõ and put Ei|p := E¬µ
i |p,
p ‚ààU 0
¬µ. The so-obtained frame {Ei} is deÔ¨Åned in the neighborhood 
Œª‚ààŒõ U 0
Œª of N
and is normal on N. Obviously, in this way can be constructed all frames normal
on N. Generally these global on N normal frames are not smooth in the regions of
overlapping of two or more local Fermi coordinates but locally, on each particular
U 0
Œª, they can be constructed in a smooth way.
5.2.
Complete description
Below, following the main ideas of Subsection 3.2 and [83], we are going to give a
full constructive description of the frames (resp. coordinates) normal on a subman-
ifold of manifold with arbitrary linear connection, if such frames (resp. coordinates)
exist.
Let M be C2 manifold endowed with C0 linear connection (of arbitrary
torsion) and N be its submanifold. The problem is to Ô¨Ånd necessary and suÔ¨Écient
conditions for the existence of frames deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood of N and normal
on N. If such frames exist, we want to give their complete description. From
Proposition 5.1, we know that the conditions (5.1) are necessary for the existence
of frames normal on N. Our Ô¨Årst goal now is to prove the suÔ¨Éciency of these
conditions, which assertion is a part of the following theorem (cf. Theorem 3.1).
Theorem 5.2. Let N be submanifold of C3 manifold M provided with C1 linear
connection, with or without torsion. Then:
(i) The equation (5.1) is a necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for the existence
of frames normal on N.

(ii) If (5.1) holds, every point q0 ‚ààN has a neighborhood UN (in M) such that on
UN exist C1 frames normal on N, i.e., on ¬ØU = UN‚à©N ‚àãq0. Moreover, on UN
exist coordinates {xi} such that every p = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤) ‚ààUN, (s, t‚Ä≤) ‚ààWN √ó
W ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜKdim N √ó Kdim M‚àídim N, has a unique ‚Äòprojection‚Äô p0 = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤

¬ØU ‚äÜN for Ô¨Åxed t‚Ä≤
0 ‚ààW ‚Ä≤ which depends on x but not on t‚Ä≤. In these local
coordinates, all frames deÔ¨Åned on UN and normal on ¬ØU = UN ‚à©N are

with A = [Aj
i ] given via equation (5.11) below in which s0 = ¬Øx(q0) are
the coordinates of q0 in the chart ( ¬ØUN, ¬Øx) of N induced by the chart (UN, x)
of M.
Proof. Let {Ei} be a frame deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood of N. From Section I.5, we
know that all frames {E‚Ä≤
i} deÔ¨Åned on the same neighborhood and normal on N
are {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} where the C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function A := [Aj
i]
is a solution of the normal frame equation (I.5.4) with N for U, viz.
Œìk(q)A(q) + (Ek(A))|q = 0
(5.7)
where q ‚ààN and Œìk :=

Œìi
jk
dim M
i,j=1 are the matrices of the connection coeÔ¨Écients
in {Ei}. Hence, the Ô¨Ånding of the general solution of (5.7) with respect to A is
equivalent to the complete description of all frames normal on N, if any.
Let q ‚ààN and (U, x) be a chart of M with ¬ØU := U ‚à©N ‚àãq. So x: U ‚ÜíW is
homeomorphism, which actually is a C1 diÔ¨Äeomorphism, for some open subset W
of Kdim M. Representing W as a Cartesian product of two open sets W ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚äÜKdim N
and W ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜKdim M‚àídim N, i.e., W = W ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ √óW ‚Ä≤, from the deÔ¨Ånition of a submanifold
(p. 7) follows the existence of t‚Ä≤
0 = (t‚Ä≤ dim N+1

, . . . , t‚Ä≤ dim M
0
) ‚ààW ‚Ä≤ such that
x(q) =


√ó t‚Ä≤

for all q ‚ààN
and ( ¬ØU, ¬Øx), with ¬Øx(q) := (x1(q), . . . , xdim N(q)) for q ‚ààN, provides a coordinate
system {¬Øxi} on ¬ØU. Let WN := ¬Øx( ¬ØU) ‚äÜW ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, i.e., ¬Øx: ¬ØU ‚ÜíWN is the local coordinate
homeomorphism from ¬ØU on the open subset WN of Kdim N.
Consider the chart (UN, x) of M with UN := x‚àí1(WN √ó W ‚Ä≤).8 Evidently
UN ‚à©N = ¬ØU ‚àãq and, for every p ‚ààUN, we have x(p) = (s, t‚Ä≤) for some unique
s = (s1, . . . , sdim N) ‚ààWN ‚äÜKdim N and t‚Ä≤ = (t‚Ä≤(dim N+1, . . . , t‚Ä≤ dim M) ‚ààW ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ
Kdim M‚àídim N; in particular, if q ‚àà¬ØU, then x(q) = (s, t‚Ä≤
0). These facts give us a
possibility to deÔ¨Åne a natural ‚Äòprojection‚Äô œÄ: UN ‚Üí¬ØU such that if p = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤) ‚àà
UN, then œÄ: p ‚Üíp0 := œÄ(p) := x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤
0), i.e., p0 is the unique point in ¬ØU with
¬Øx(p0) = s.9
Suppose the matrix-valued function A is of class C3. There exist C1 matrix-
valued functions Bkl on UN such that they and their partial derivatives are
8Strictly speaking, x in (UN, x) has to be replace by the restriction xN := x|UN ; we ignore
this to save some writing.
9The triple (UN, œÄ, ¬ØU) is a Ô¨Åbre bundle with base ¬ØU, (total) bundle space UN, and projection
œÄ (see further Section IV.2). From here the name ‚Äòprojection‚Äô for œÄ comes from.

and Za = ‚àíŒìa, by Lemma 4.1, Assertion (i) it has solutions if and only if the

Remark 5.3 on page 114), this means that (5.7) has solutions on N with respect
to A iÔ¨Ä(5.1) is valid.
Now we suppose (5.1) to be true. Applying Lemma 4.1, Assertion (ii) and
taking into account Remark 4.5 on page 106, we Ô¨Ånd the general solution of (5.9a)

where s0 ‚ààWN ‚äÜKdim N is Ô¨Åxed and we used p = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤) ‚ààUN, p0 = œÄ(p) =
x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤
0) ‚àà¬ØU = UN ‚à©N, and ¬Øx(p0) = s. Notice, in this equality all terms
corresponding to k, l = 1, . . . , dim N are zero as xa(p) = xa(p0) = ¬Øxa(p0) = sa for
a = 1, . . . , dim N. Since (5.11) is the general solution of (5.7) on ¬ØU by construction,
the above results, together with Proposition 5.1 complete the proof of Theorem 5.2.
‚ñ°
Remark 5.7. Since t‚Ä≤
0 in (5.8) depends only on the choice of the initial coordinates
{xi}, the matrix B(t‚Ä≤
0) is constant on N for every such particular choice. This
agrees with Proposition I.5.2 and Corollary I.5.1.
Remark 5.8. Notice, equation (5.11) corresponds to (5.6) for xi = yi ({yi} are
Fermi coordinates) and B(p) = Y (¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ). The terms corresponding to the index
values from 1 to dim N are zero in the both equations.
Remark 5.9. Theorem 5.2 is a Ô¨Årst in a group of similar Theorems III.7.1, III.8.1,
IV.6.1, and IV.9.1 generalizing it. (See also the comments after the proof of The-
orem IV.9.1 on page 269.)
Corollary 5.1. Let N be a submanifold of C3 manifold with C1 linear connection.
On N (locally) exist normal frames if and only if the parallel transport in N along
paths lying in N is path-independent.10
Proof. See Theorem 5.2 and Lemma 5.1 on page 112
‚ñ°
Corollary 5.2. Let N be a submanifold of C3 manifold with C1 linear connection.
On N (locally) exist normal frames iÔ¨Äon N exists a parallel frame with respect to
the paths in N.
Proof. If {Ei} is frame normal on N, then it is also parallel on N, due to Propo-
sition I.5.6. Conversely, let {Ei} be parallel frame on N, i.e., (‚àáXEi)|N = 0 for
all X ‚ààX(N). The parallel transport of some Y0 = Y i
0 Ei|p0 ‚ààTp0(M), p0 ‚ààN,
along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN from p0 = Œ≥(s0) to every p = Œ≥(s) for some s0, s ‚ààJ gives the
vector Yp = YŒ≥(s) where Y is such that (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2) (‚àáÀôŒ≥Y )|Œ≥(s) = 0 and
Yp0 = Y0. But ‚àáÀôŒ≥Y |Œ≥(s) =

ÀôŒ≥k‚àáEk(Y jEj)

|Œ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥k(s)(‚àáEkY j)|Œ≥(s)Ej|Œ≥(s) =
ÀôŒ≥(s)(Y j
Œ≥(s))Ej|Œ≥(s), so that ÀôŒ≥(s)(Y j
Œ≥(s)) = 0, i.e., Y j
Œ≥(s) = Y j
0 = const. Hence the
parallel transport of Y0 from p0 to p along any path connecting them in N gives
the vector Y j
0 Ej|p and, consequently, it is path-independent in N. Now Corol-
lary 5.1 implies the existence of frames normal on N.
‚ñ°
Theorem 5.2 gives a complete local description of the frames normal on a
submanifold. On this base a complete global description of all frames normal on a
submanifold can be given. Indeed, let { ¬ØU Œª|Œª ‚ààŒõ}, Œõ Ã∏= ‚àÖ, be an open cover of N
such that for every Œª ‚ààŒõ there is a neighborhood U Œª
N in M such that ¬ØU Œª = U Œª
N ‚à©N
and on U Œª
N exist frames {EŒª
i } normal on ¬ØU Œª, like the ones constructed above.
In the neighborhood VN := 
Œª‚ààŒõ U Œª
N of N we deÔ¨Åne a frame {Ei} by putting
10If M is multiply connected, see Remark I.3.5 on page 29.

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
Ei|p = EŒª
i |p, p ‚ààVN for some Œª ‚ààŒõ for which p ‚ààU Œª
N; if there are more than one
such Œª, we arbitrary choose some of them. By construction {Ei} is a global frame
which is normal on the whole submanifold N. Generally {Ei} is not smooth, even
not continuous, on the sets (neighborhoods) of intersection (overlapping) of two
or more neighborhoods U Œª
N. Relying on Theorem 5.2 (ii), we conclude that in this
way can be constructed all frames (globally) normal on any submanifold.
Now we have at our disposal the full machinery required for the complete
description of all local coordinates normal on a given submanifold. Meanwhile we
shall Ô¨Ånd a necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for the existence of coordinates
normal on a submanifold.
The following theorem provides a complete constructive description of all
local coordinates normal on a submanifold.
Theorem 5.3. Let N be submanifold of C3 manifold M endowed with C1 torsion
free linear connection for which the condition (5.1) holds. Then for every point
q ‚ààN exists a chart (Uz, z) of M with Uz ‚àãq which is normal on Uz ‚à©N. The
coordinate functions zi : Uz ‚ÜíK of all such charts normal on N are given via
equation (5.16) below.
Proof. Suppose M is a C3 manifold endowed with C0 torsionless linear connection
‚àáfor which the (integrability) conditions (5.1) are valid on some submanifold N
of M. Theorem 5.1 ensures the existence of coordinates normal on N, the Fermi
coordinates providing an example. The problem is to Ô¨Ånd all such coordinates.
For its solution we shall follow the scheme of Subsection 3.2 for the complete
description of the local coordinates normal along a path (see p. 100 and further).
Consider the chart (UN, x) of M, deÔ¨Åned in the proof of Theorem 5.2, for
which each point p = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤) ‚ààUN has a unique projection p0 := œÄ(p) =
x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤
0) on N. By Theorem 5.2, Assertion (ii) on UN all frames normal on
¬ØU = UN ‚à©N are

E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj

with A = [Aj
i] given via (5.11). Therefore if local
coordinates {zi}, deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood Uz of ¬ØU in UN, Uz ‚à©N = ¬ØU and
normal on ¬ØU, exist, then they must satisfy the conditions

(5.12)
Here q = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤
0) ‚àà¬ØU and A is some matrix-valued function given by equa-
tion (5.11). Since the manifold is of class C3, the Taylor expansion
zi(p) = zi(p0)+ai
j(p0)[xj(p)‚àíxj(p0)]+ai
jk(p)[xj(p)‚àíxj(p0)][xk(p)‚àíxk(p0)]
(5.13)
is valid for every p ‚ààUz, p0 = œÄ(p). Here ai
j : ¬ØU ‚ÜíK are of class C1 and the C1
functions ai
jk : ¬ØU ‚ÜíK and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded on ¬ØU. Notice,
due to p0 = œÄ(p), we have xa(p) = xa(p0) = sa for a = 1, . . . , dim N; so in (5.13)

along some path lying entirely in ¬ØU. The integral in the above equality is path-
independent. This can be proved in the same way we proved the path-independence
of the integral in (5.3). As

Ei = Aj

also parallel in U which, in particular, means that ‚àá‚àÇ/‚àÇxaEk = 0. This equation
is equivalent to

‚àÇA‚àí1

there exists a neighborhood Uz of ¬ØU in UN such that Uz ‚à©N = ¬ØU and (Uz, z) is a

The charts (Uz, z) (locally) generate the restrictions to N of all frames normal
on Uz but generally these charts are not normal on N, i.e., on ¬ØU. To make them
such, we are going to choose the functions ai

where q ‚àà¬ØU, a = 1, . . . , dim N, m, n = dim N + 1, . . . , dim M, and A is provided
by (5.11). (Notice, in (5.14) the terms with j, k = 1, . . . , dim N vanish as p0 =
œÄ(p), so that xa(p) = ¬Øxa(p) = ¬Øxa(p0) for a = 1, . . . , dim N.) Substituting these
expressions into (5.15) and using ‚àÇA‚àí1

ak (the connection
is symmetric); this reÔ¨Çects the vanishment of the terms with j, k = 1, . . . , dim N
in (5.14). The second equation determines ai

ai
(mn), as well as ai

and the matrix-valued C1 function A: Uz ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K) is given by (5.11) in
which B is dim M √ó dim M non-degenerate matrix-valued function, the matrix-
valued functions Blk on Uz are of class C1 and they and their Ô¨Årst partial deriva-
tives are bounded on ¬ØU, and Y is the unique solution of the initial-value prob-
lem (4.4) with
‚àÇ
‚àÇsa , ‚àíŒìa, ¬Øx(p0), s0 = ¬Øx(q0), and s for ea, Za, p, p0, and q0,
respectively. This ends the proof of Theorem 5.3.
‚ñ°
Remark 5.10. Theorem 5.3 remains valid if N is Ô¨Åxed and the connection is tor-
sionless only on N (see Proposition 5.3).
Remark 5.11. Generally, under the conditions of Theorem 5.3, not all of the normal
frames provided by Theorem 5.2, point (ii), are holonomic.
Proposition 5.3. Let N be submanifold of a C3 manifold endowed with C1 linear
connection ‚àáadmitting frames normal on N. Holonomic frames normal on N or,
equivalently, coordinates normal on N for ‚àáexist if and only if the torsion T of
‚àávanishes on N,
(T (X, Y, ))|q = 0,
Xq, Yq ‚ààTq(N),
q ‚ààN
(5.18)
where X and Y are vector Ô¨Åelds on N, X, Y ‚ààX(N) ‚äÜX(M).
Proof. The result follows from Proposition I.5.4 and the observation that in the
proof of Theorem 5.3, as well as in the one of Theorem 5.1, only the torsionless
on N of the connection was used.

Exercise 5.7. Find the explicit formula expressing the initial coordinates {xi} via

Once again, we would like to notice that the coordinates normal on a sub-
manifold N of M are local by their essence, they can be global, i.e., deÔ¨Åned on a
neighborhood of the whole N, only as an exception. But, generally, we can con-
struct a family of overlapping coordinates normal on N such that the union of
their domains forms a neighborhood of N in M.

Chapter II. Normal Frames for Connections
At the end, going rather ahead, we want to mention that the condition (5.1),
ensuring the existence of frames normal on a submanifold N, has a quite natural
interpretation in the theory of linear transports along paths (see Chapter IV, in
particular Proposition IV.11.2 on page 282): it expresses the Ô¨Çatness on N of the
parallel transport assigned to the linear connection under consideration.
6.
Examples of normal frames and coordinates
Similarly to Section I.7, the present one contains diÔ¨Äerent examples of frames
and/or coordinates that are normal for some concrete connections on some sets.
Their role is to illustrate the general theory presented in the preceding sections of
this chapter.
Since the complete and explicit description of all coordinates normal at a
point is expressible in a simple way via the coeÔ¨Écients of a symmetric linear
connection (see Theorem 2.1), the reader can easily obtain (by means of (2.11‚Ä≤))
as exercise this description for the Riemannian connections considered in Exam-
ples I.7.3‚ÄìI.7.11 in which the coeÔ¨Écients of the corresponding connections are
explicitly written.
Unfortunately, a ‚Äòmore realistic‚Äô example is, the more diÔ¨Écult are the con-
crete calculations; besides, the problems of Ô¨Ånding explicitly frames/coordinates
normal on (sub)sets diÔ¨Äerent from a single point cannot be solved completely in
closed form (in elementary functions or in radicals); for instance, to Ô¨Ånd a frame
or coordinate system (locally) normal along a path, one needs the solution of the
initial-value problem (3.17) (for concrete Z) and the coordinates constructed in
Lemma 3.1.
Example 6.1 (Coordinates normal at a point in S2). Consider the 2-sphere S2,
investigated in Example I.7.3, and a point p ‚ààS2. Choose spherical coordinates
(Œ∏, œï) on S2 such that Œ∏(p) = œÄ
2 and œï(p) = 0; so p will be in the great equatorial
circle of S2. The coordinates (Œ∏, œï) are normal at p (as well as at any point in the
equatorial circle) for the Riemannian ‚àáaccording to Example I.7.3 in which ‚àáis
deÔ¨Åned. Taking into account Remark 2.1, we can assert that all coordinate systems
{z1, z2} on S2, which are normal at p, are given via the equations (see (2.13))

6. Examples of normal frames and coordinates
129
Example 6.2 (Frames/coordinates normal along a great circle on S2). Let us sup-
pose that the path Œ≥ : [0, 2œÄ) ‚ÜíS2 is a great circle on the 2-sphere S2 (see Ex-
ample I.7.3) and (Œ∏, œï) are spherical coordinates on S2 such that Œ≥ lies on the
equatorial plane, i.e., Œ∏ ‚ó¶Œ≥ = œÄ
2 and œï ‚ó¶Œ≥ = id[0,2œÄ). We know from Example I.7.3
that the coordinates system {Œ∏, œï} is normal along the whole path Œ≥ for the Rie-
mannian connection ‚àádescribe in the example mentioned.
Due to Corollary 3.2 on page 103, all frames {E‚Ä≤

œï(p0) is a Ô¨Åxed number in [0, 2œÄ). By the same corollary, all coordinate systems
{z1, z2} on S2, which are normal for ‚àáalong Œ≥, have the representation (see (3.30))

(6.11)
Below in this and in the next two examples, we shall consider some problems
concerning frames normal for Weyl connections.
First of all, we notice that, if a frame {Ei} on V ‚äÜM is normal on U ‚äÜV
for the Riemannian connection ‚àáR (with coeÔ¨Écients (6.5)), then it is normal for
the Weyl connection ‚àáon the set
U W := {p ‚ààU : œâi|p = 0 for i = 1, . . . , dim M} = {p ‚ààU : œâ|p = 0}
(6.12)
which may be empty. This is a consequence from (6.9) and
Œìi
jk|U = W i
jk|U
(6.13)

6. Examples of normal frames and coordinates
131
due to (6.4), (6.5) and RŒìi
jk|U = 0 as the frame {Ei} is normal for ‚àáR on U. As
a result of the simpliÔ¨Åcation (6.13), a frame like {Ei} can be used as an initial one
from which frames normal for ‚àáon subset(s) U may be constructed.
Example 6.4 (Weyl connections on S2). Let ‚àáR be the Riemannian connection on
the 2-sphere S2 investigated in Example I.7.3. Its coeÔ¨Écients in spherical coordi-
nates (x1 = Œ∏, x2 = œï) are given by (I.7.11). The coordinate system {x1, x2} is nor-
mal along the equatorial circle Œ≥ : [0, 2œÄ) ‚ÜíS2 with x1‚ó¶Œ≥ = œÄ
2 and x2‚ó¶Œ≥ = id[0,2œÄ).
Suppose ‚àáis a Weyl connection on S2 whose Riemannian part is ‚àáR. Then,
due to (6.13), we have (i, j = 1, 2)
Œìi
jk ‚ó¶Œ≥ = W i
jk ‚ó¶Œ≥
(6.14)
with Wk = [W i
jk] given by (6.11). Thus, if there exist p ‚ààŒ≥([0, 2œÄ)) such that
œâ|p = 0, then {x1, x2} is normal for ‚àáat p. From here immediately follows that,
if œâ|p = 0 for some p ‚ààS2, then one can construct spherical coordinates (with p
in their equatorial plane) which are normal at p for ‚àá.
In the general case, frames/coordinates normal for ‚àáat an arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed
point p ‚ààS2 can be constructed as follows. Take spherical coordinates (x1 =
Œ∏, x2 = œï) on S2 such that p is in their equatorial plane, e.g., we can choose them
in such a way that Œ∏(p) = œÄ
2 and œï(p) = 0. Then {x1, x2} is normal for ‚àáR along
the equatorial circle and, in particular, at p.
According to Theorem 2.3, all frames normal at p for ‚àá(but not for ‚àáR)
are {Ei = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj } with A = [Ai
j] given by (2.14) in which one should put Œì1(p) =
W1(p) and Œì2(p) = W2(p) (see (6.13)), where W1 and W2 are given by (6.11) with
œâ1 = œâ

Similarly, to obtain all coordinates normal at p, one has to substitute the equality
Œìi
(jk)(p)=W i
jk(p), with W i
jk given by (6.11), in (2.11‚Ä≤). The reader may wish to
write as an exercise the explicit form of the so-obtained coordinates normal at p.
Example 6.5 (Weyl connection on Minkowski spacetime). Let now ‚àábe a Weyl
connection on the Minkowski spacetime R4
3 and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíR4
3 be a straight line; e.g.,
it may be a trajectory of a photon, ÀôŒ≥ = 0, and hence lying on the light cone (see
Example I.7.12). We shall look for a coordinate system normal for ‚àáalong Œ≥.
From the standard coordinate system {ui : i = 1, . . . , 4}, we can obtain via a
pseudo-orthogonal transformation, which preserves the components of the metric
e4
3 of R4
3, a new coordinates system {xi} such that x1 ‚ó¶Œ≥ = idR, i.e., the x1-axis to
coincide with the line Œ≥. 1 The coordinate system {xi} is of the type constructed
in Lemma 3.1; it corresponds to U1 = R4
3 and t0 = (0, 0, 0).
1Here we shall not discuss the physical possibilities for realization of the coordinate system
{xi}.

(resp. coordinate systems {zi}) on R4

Y |s=s0 = 1.
Unfortunately, an explicit and Ô¨Ånite expression for Y can be obtained only in some
exceptional cases. For instance, if œâi = œâ
 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

are constant functions, then W1 is
a constant matrix. This immediately implies
Y (s, s0; ‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥) = e‚àí(s‚àís0)W1‚ó¶Œ≥.
Exercise 6.1. Generalize the above results for Rn

a straight line in Rn
q .
Example 6.6 (Flat Riemannian connections). Example I.7.1 will be re-considered
below from the view-point of the results of Section 4.
Let M be a C3 Riemannian manifold with C2 metric g and ‚àábe the Rie-
mannian connection generated by g. Suppose ‚àáis Ô¨Çat on an open set U ‚äÜM. By
Theorem 4.3, there exist normal coordinates xi with domain V ‚äÜU for ‚àá. The
coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáin these coordinates are Œìi
jk =

 i
ji

= 0, which implies gij,k = 0
in them (see (I.4.16)). Consequently, the components gij of g in {xi} are constant
on V . In this way we have inverted the implication/conclusions of Example I.7.1.
The coordinates xi can be calculated by means of (4.14), but the Ô¨Ånding of
their explicit form may turn to be a diÔ¨Écult problem. However, if one Ô¨Ånds a
coordinate system {xi} on V ‚äÜU in which the metric components are constant,
then it will be also normal for ‚àáon V (see (I.4.16)). For instance, such are the
standard coordinates on the Euclidean space En and on the pseudo-Euclidean
space Rn
q (see Example I.7.1 and (I.7.16)). In particular, the standard (Cartesian)
coordinates on the Minkowski spacetime M4 = R4
3 (or R4
1) are normal on M4 for
the Ô¨Çat Riemannian connection on it induced by the metric e4
3.
Example 6.7 (One-dimensional real manifolds). There are at lest two reasons for
the global (local) existence of normal frames (coordinates) on 1-dimensional C3
real manifolds endowed with a linear connection ‚àá, viz.:

6. Examples of normal frames and coordinates
133
(i) The curvature and torsion tensors identically vanish in the 1-dimensional
case (see (I.3.13) and (I.3.14) with all indices taking the sole value 1). We
can rephrase this by saying that any linear connection on 1-dimensional man-
ifold is Ô¨Çat and torsionless. Consequently Theorems 4.1 and 4.3 imply the
above result. Respectively, Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.3 give a complete
description of all normal frames and coordinates.
(ii) A chart (U, x) on 1-dimensional manifold M consists of an open set U ‚äÜM
and homomorphism x: U ‚ÜíJ with J being an open real interval. Thus
x‚àí1 : J ‚ÜíM is a path for which the results of Section 3 are applicable. In
particular, Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 (resp. Theorem 3.3) describe(s) all frames
(resp. coordinates) normal along x‚àí1. Besides, since M can be represented
as a union of curves like x‚àí1(J), frames globally normal on M for ‚àácan be
constructed in a way similar to the one described in the proof of Theorem 3.2.
Let us now write some explicit formulae regarding coordinates/frames normal
for a C1 connection ‚àáon a C3 1-dimensional real manifold M. Let (U, x) be a
chart of M with x: U ‚ÜíJ ‚äÜR and {x1} be the corresponding coordinate system
consisting of the sole coordinate function x1 = u1‚ó¶x = idR‚ó¶x = x. The connection
‚àáhas in {x1} a sole coeÔ¨Écient Œì1
11 coinciding with the matrix Œì1 = [Œì1
11] = Œì1
11.
To construct coordinates/frames normal for ‚àá, we need, according to the
scheme describe in Section 4, the solution Y (p, p0; ‚àíŒì1), for Ô¨Åxed p0 ‚ààU and any
p ‚ààU, of the initial-value problem
dY

Example 6.8 (Frames/coordinates normal along geodesic in 2-manifold). This ex-
ample demonstrates that frames/coordinates normal along geodesic paths in a
2-dimensional manifold can always be found explicitly via quadratures.
Suppose M is a C3 2-dimensional manifold, ‚àáis a C0 connection on M and
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a geodesic. Due to Remark 3.7 on page 95, the equations Œì1
11 ‚ó¶Œ≥ = 0
and Œì2
11‚ó¶Œ≥ = 0 hold in the coordinates {x1, x2} provided by Lemma 3.1. Therefore

The formula (6.22) (resp. (6.23)) gives a complete local description of all
frames (resp. coordinates) normal along a geodesic path Œ≥ for arbitrary (resp.
symmetric) linear connection ‚àáon a 2-dimensional manifold. If one needs frames
globally normal along Œ≥, the scheme proposed in the proof of Theorem 3.2 can be
applied for their construction and/or complete description.
Example 6.9 (Open Einstein-de Sitter Universe). The (open) Einstein-de Sitter
Universe is a concrete type of non-static homogeneous cosmological model (see [58]
and Example I.7.11). Its geometrical base is the Einstein-de Sitter manifold which
is a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Riemannian metric g which in a
suitable coordinate system {x1 = x, x2 = y, x3 = z, x4 = ct} has components gij,

Consequently, the coordinate system {xi} is normal on the set {p : f ‚Ä≤(x4(p)) =
0}, which may be empty if f ‚Ä≤ is nowhere vanishing function. However, if, for
instance, there is a point p0 such that f ‚Ä≤(x4(p0)) = 0, then {xi} is normal on the
3-dimensional submanifold {p : x4(p) = x4(p0)}.
Due to Theorem 2.1, all coordinates yi normal for ‚àáat an arbitrarily chosen
point p are given by (2.11‚Ä≤). So, substituting (6.25) into (2.11‚Ä≤), we get their explicit
form as:

Similarly, all frames normal at a point p are described via Theorem 2.3.
Thus, to obtain an explicit expression for them, one simply has to substitute (6.26)
into (2.14).

and then Theorems 3.1 and 3.3 should be applied.

Conclusion
The main subject of this chapter was the existence and (non-)uniqueness of normal
frames and coordinates for linear connections on diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds. The
existing literature on the problem was reviewed (in modern notation). It deals
only with normal coordinates which exist only for torsionless connections. The
few works investigating the asymmetric case do not add nothing new as they
treat the symmetric part of the connection, thus transferring the problem to the
exploration of some other torsion free linear connection.
The major classical results concerning the normal coordinates for linear con-
nections are summarized in the Table 7.1 on the next page.

Besides the detailed review of these results, we have presented a number
of their generalizations and wide discussion of related topics and methods, most
of which seem to be new ones and appearing in the present book for the Ô¨Årst
time.1 They include mainly: (i) Description of all frames normal for symmetric
connections; (ii) Complete description of all coordinates normal for torsionless
linear connections (cases at a given point, along paths, and on submanifolds); (iii)
Existence and complete constructive description of all frames normal at a single
point, along (locally injective) paths, and on submanifolds for arbitrary linear con-
nections, with or without torsion. Moreover, with respect to the references cited,
we have made a number of improvements of the existing proofs of known results,
a lot of facts are formulated more precisely, and some assertions are (partially)
generalized. The reader interested in what exactly is new in Subsections 2.1, 3.1,
and 5.1 and in Section 4 may wish to compare them with the references given
at their beginnings and the ones of Sections 2‚Äì5. Subsections 2.2, 3.2, and 5.2,
entitled ‚ÄòComplete description‚Äô contain original material.
Here we want to emphasize on the following facts. First, normal coordinates
(may) exist only for torsionless linear connections while normal frames (may) exist
for arbitrary connections; the normal frames for connections with non-zero (resp.

zero) torsion are with necessity anholonomic (resp. holonomic). Second, at a single
point or along a path normal coordinates (resp. frames) always exist for torsionless
(resp. arbitrary) linear connections; on submanifolds of dimension greater than one
they exist if and only if the parallel transport on it along paths lying entirely in it is
path-independent; in particular on the whole manifold normal coordinates/frames
exist iÔ¨Äit is Ô¨Çat. Third, the normal coordinates, if any, are essentially local; globally
they exist only as an exception. If local normal frames exist, then global normal
frames always exist but they are smooth generally only locally.
Looking over the Riemannian coordinates, Riemannian normal coordinates,
and Fermi coordinates (along a path or on submanifold, if any in the last case),
we see that they are constructed in a uniform common way by employing the
(local) existence of geodesics. From this point of view, the above coordinates are
realization of one special kind of normal coordinates on submanifolds of zero, one,
or higher dimension respectively.

Introduction
The aim of this chapter is the investigation of frames and coordinates normal for
diÔ¨Äerent kinds of derivations of the tensor algebra over a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold.
Since the linear connections are a particular example of such derivations, the
presented here material is a direct continuation and generalization of the one in
Chapter II. But, as we shall see, a number of problems concerning normal frames
and charts for general derivations are ‚Äòlocally‚Äô reduced to the same problems for
linear connections and, consequently, their (local) solutions could be found, in
more or less ready form, in Chapter II.
Some of the results in the present chapter are partially based on the ones in
the series of works [76,80,83‚Äì87] and are completely revised and generalized their
versions. But most of the material is new and original.
Section 2 has an introductory character. The concepts of derivations and
derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds of the tensor algebra over a manifold are intro-
duced. Their components, coeÔ¨Écients (if they are linear), curvature, and torsion
are deÔ¨Åned. Next, in Section 3, the normal frames and coordinates are deÔ¨Åned as
ones in which the components of a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds vanish (on some
set). The equations describing the transition to normal frames or coordinates are
derived and the linearity of a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds is pointed as a necessary
conditions for their existence.
In Section 4 (resp. Section 5) is proved that at a single point (resp. along a
(locally injective) path) frames normal for a linear at it (resp. along it) derivation
along vector Ô¨Åelds always exist and their complete descriptions are given. Besides,
if the derivation is torsionless, all normal coordinates are found. In Sections 6‚Äì8,
the problems of existence, uniqueness, and complete description of frames and local
charts (or coordinates) on neighborhoods, on submanifolds, and along (injective
or locally injective) mappings, respectively, for derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds are
studied in details and solved.
To the problems concerning frames or coordinates normal for derivations
along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld is devoted Section 9. The existence of normal frames and
coordinates in this case is proved. A complete description of the frames normal at
a single point, along a path, and on the whole manifold are presented. The local
charts (or coordinates) normal at a point are completely described. Along a path
the explicit system of diÔ¨Äerential equations, which the normal coordinates must
satisfy and which always have (local) solutions, is derived. A method for obtaining
the coordinates (locally) normal on the whole manifold is pointed in the C‚àûcase.
Normal frames for derivations along paths are investigated in Section 10.
After the introduction of the basic deÔ¨Ånitions and notation, it is proved that frames
normal for a derivation along a given (Ô¨Åxed) path always exist and their general
form is found. A (local) holonomic extension of such frames, as well as of any other
frame deÔ¨Åned only along a path, is constructed. For derivations along arbitrary
paths is proved that they admit normal frames iÔ¨Äthey are covariant derivatives

along paths induced by linear connections for which normal frames exist. Since
the normal frames for the derivations and connections turn to be identical, all
problems for these frames are transferred to similar ones considered in Chapter II.
Section 11 deals with problems connected with frames simultaneously nor-
mal for two derivations along arbitrary/Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld or path. Necessary and
suÔ¨Écient conditions for the existence of such frames are found. In particular, in
the case of arbitrary vector Ô¨Åeld or path, they exist iÔ¨Äthe two derivations coin-
cide. Normal frames for mixed linear connections are explored. It is shown that
this range of problems is completely and equivalently reduced to similar one for
two, possibly identical, linear connections, the contra- and co-variant ‚Äòparts‚Äô of the
initial mixed connection.
In Section 12 are collected and commented some results concerning linear
connections obtained in the preceding sections of this chapter.
Section 13 illustrates the theory of the preceding sections with concrete
examples.
Section 14 contains a discussion of some terminological problems linked to
the normal frames or coordinates.
The chapter ends with certain general remarks in Section 15.

Derivations of the tensor algebra over a manifold
The idea of a derivation of the algebra T (M) of tensor Ô¨Åelds over a manifold M
is in T 1(M) to be introduced an operator analogous to the (ordinary or partial)
derivative of scalar functions and ‚Äòcompatible‚Äô with the tensor structure of T 1(M).
The covariant derivative (along vector Ô¨Åelds), introduced via DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1 is, as
we shall see below, a particular example of a derivation of the tensor algebra over
a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. The analysis of the system of axioms in DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1
reveals that not all of them are equally important for an abstract deÔ¨Ånition of
derivation and leads to the following deÔ¨Ånition (see [11, Chapter I, ¬ß 3] and [12,88]).
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1. A derivation of the tensor algebra T 1(U) (or of T (U)), U being
an open set in M, is a mapping D: T 1(U) ‚ÜíT 0(U) possessing the following
properties:
(i) Linearity,
D(aK + bL) = aD(K) + bD(L),
a, b ‚ààK,
K, L ‚ààTr;1
s (U).
(ii) Leibnitz rule (relative to tensor multiplication),
D(K ‚äóL) = (D(K)) ‚äóL + K ‚äóD(L)
K, L ‚ààT 1(U).
(iii) Type preservation,
D: Tr;1
s (U) ‚ÜíTr;0
s (U).

Example 2.1. The comparison of DeÔ¨Ånitions I.3.1 and 2.1 (see also comments I.3.1)
shows that every covariant derivative ‚àáX along X ‚ààX(U) is a derivation of
T 1(U). Other examples of derivations are provided by the Lie derivative LX along
X ‚ààX(U) and by arbitrary tensor Ô¨Åeld S ‚ààT1
1 of type (1, 1) [11]. This is easily seen
from the following local expansions in the tensor frame with basic Ô¨Åelds (I.2.41)
induced by a frame {Ei} on U [11,19,89]:

s (U) is arbitrary C1 tensor Ô¨Åeld of type (r, s) on U.
The following proposition describes the general structures of the derivations
of T 1(U) [11, Chapter I, Proposition 3.3].
Proposition 2.1. For every derivation D of T 1(U), there exist unique vector Ô¨Åeld
X ‚ààX1(U) and tensor Ô¨Åeld SX ‚ààT1
1(U), generally depending on X, such that
D = LX + SX,
(2.3)
i.e., every derivation admits a unique decomposition (2.3).
Proof. See [11, Chapter I, proof of Proposition 3.3].
‚ñ°
Example 2.2. In particular, a covariant derivative ‚àáX along X ‚ààX(U) has a
representation (2.3) with SX given via
SX(Y ) = Œ£X(Y ) := ‚àáXY ‚àí[X, Y ] = ‚àáY X + T (X, Y )
(2.4)
where Y ‚ààX(U) and T is the torsion of ‚àá(see (I.3.12)).
Evidently, every pair (X, S) with X ‚ààX(U) and S : X(U) ‚ÜíT1
1(U), S : X ‚Üí
SX, deÔ¨Ånes a unique derivation of T 1(U) by (2.3). There is a one-to-one onto
correspondence, given via (2.3), between the sets of derivations of T 1(U) and the
set of pairs (X, S). If some derivation D has a decomposition (2.3), we shall write
DS
X instead of D; if the dependence on X is essential and the one on S is not, we
reduce DS
X to DX. We say that DX is a derivation along X.

i
j the (local) components of DX in {Ei}; respectively, we
call ŒìX :=

ŒìX
i
j

matrix (of the components) or components‚Äô matrix of DX.
An important result follows from the comparison of equations (2.6) and (I.3.1)
(or (2.5) and (I.3.2) and taking into account (I.3.3)).

(2.8)
for some functions Œìi
jk : U ‚ÜíK, which are coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection on U.
Hence the covariant derivatives are derivations whose components depend
linearly on the generating them via (2.3) vector Ô¨Åeld X.
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.2. A derivation DX of T 1(M) is said to be linear on (in) a set U ‚äÜM
or along a mapping Œ∑: Q ‚ÜíM for a set Q Ã∏= ‚àÖ, if in some frame (and hence in
all frames) {Ei} the relation
ŒìX(p) = [ŒìX
i
j(p)] = Œìk(p)Xk(p)
(2.9)
holds for some matrix-valued functions Œì1, . . . , Œìdim M on U or on Œ∑(Q) and every
p ‚ààU or p ‚ààŒ∑(Q), respectively.
According to Proposition 2.2, the covariant derivatives are derivations which
are linear at every point.
If we transform the frame {Ei} on U into a frame {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} by means
of a C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function A = [Aj
i ], we see from (2.6) and
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1 that the components ŒìX

Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Introducing the matrix ŒìX := [ŒìX
i
j]dim M
i,j=1
of the components of the derivation
DX, we rewrite (2.10) in the form (cf. (I.5.3))
ŒìX ‚ÜíŒì‚Ä≤
X = A‚àí1[ŒìXA + X(A)]
(2.11)
where X(A) := [X(Ai
j)]dim M
i,j=1 .
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.3. A derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds of the tensor algebra T 1(U),
U ‚äÜM, is a mapping assigning to every X ‚ààX(U) a derivation DX of T 1(U)
with decomposition DX = LX + SX for some S : X(U) ‚ÜíT1
1(U), S : X ‚ÜíSX.
The concept of a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds1 generalizes the one of a linear
connection (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1) to which it reduces if the derivative DX along X
is a covariant one. In a given frame {Ei}, the main diÔ¨Äerence between the linear
connections and derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds is expressed by equations (I.3.1)
and (2.6). The former one deÔ¨Ånes the coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
jk : U ‚ÜíK of a linear con-
nection ‚àáirrespectively of some vector Ô¨Åelds, while the latter one deÔ¨Ånes the
components Œìi
j : U ‚ÜíK of a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds only with respect to
some vector Ô¨Åeld X and, generally, one can not get rid of the dependence on X
unless DX is linear in X.
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.4. A derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds is linear on (in) a set U ‚äÜM
or along a mapping Œ∑: Q ‚ÜíM, Q Ã∏= ‚àÖ, if in some frame (and hence in all frames)
{Ei} the matrix ŒìX :=

Œìi
j
dim M
i,j=1 of the components of D along every X ‚ààX(M)
admits a decomposition (2.9) for some matrix-valued functions Œì1, . . . , Œìdim M on
U or on Œ∑(Q) and every p ‚ààU or p ‚ààŒ∑(Q), respectively.
Example 2.3. It is trivial to verify that the linear connections are derivation along
vector Ô¨Åelds linear at every point. Conversely, a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds
linear on U is a linear connection on U. In fact, equation (2.8) holds for the
components of such a derivation2 and, by Proposition 2.2, DX is a covariant
derivative along X. So, by DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1, D is a linear connection on U.
The elements Œìi
jk of the matrices Œìk, corresponding via (2.9) to a linear
derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds, will be called coeÔ¨Écients of D on U. It is clear,
the coeÔ¨Écients of D exist only on sets on which D is linear and they transform
as coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection by (I.3.5). The matrices Œìk =

Œìi
jk
dim M
i,j=1
will be called matrices of the derivation coeÔ¨Écients, or derivation‚Äôs matrices, or
coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of the derivation.
The deÔ¨Ånition of a Cr derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds (on Ck manifold with
k ‚â•r) is similar to the one of Cr linear connection (see Subsection I.3.2) and it
is based on the transformation law (2.11). Given a class of frames connected via
linear transformations whose matrices are Cr‚Ä≤, r‚Ä≤ ‚â•1, matrix-valued functions, a
1In the series of papers [76, 80, 83] the name S-derivation is used instead of derivation along
vector Ô¨Åelds.
2If (2.8) is valid, the equality (2.5) is equivalent on U to (I.3.2) and (I.3.3) with ‚àá= D.

2. Derivations on diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds
147
derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds is said to be of class Cr, r ‚â§r‚Ä≤‚àí1 with respect to it if
its local components in one (and hence in all) frame(s) in the above set of frames are
of class Cr. In what follows, we shall suppose by default that a given class of Cr‚Ä≤,
r‚Ä≤ ‚â§k ‚àí1, frames is Ô¨Åxed on a Ck, k ‚â•2, manifold M and it consists of all frames
associated to one (or all) systems of local coordinates on M or its open subsets
and all frames obtainable from them by means of linear transformations with Cr‚Ä≤
matrices. For instance, by a C1 derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds we understand one
on a C3 manifold whose local components are C1 functions in any frame which is
coordinate or is obtainable from such by means of C2 transformations.
Analogously to the case of linear connections (see the end of Subsection I.3.2),
the concepts of curvature and torsion can be deÔ¨Åned for derivations along vector
Ô¨Åelds.
The (operators of) curvature RD and torsion T D of a C1 or arbitrary, re-
spectively, derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds on C3 or C2 manifold M, resp., are
mappings
RD : X(M) √ó X(M) √ó T (M) ‚ÜíT (M)
T D : X1(M) √ó X1(M) ‚ÜíX0(M)
such that
RD : (X, Y ) ‚ÜíRD(X, Y ) := DX ‚ó¶DY ‚àíDY ‚ó¶DX ‚àíD[X,Y ]
(2.12)
T D : (X, Y ) ‚ÜíT D(X, Y ) := DX(Y ) ‚àíDY (X) ‚àí[X, Y ]
(2.13)
for all vector Ô¨Åelds X, Y
‚ààX(M). By abuse of the language, the quantities
RD(X, Y ) and T D(X, Y ) will also be called (operators of) curvature and tor-
sion, respectively, of D (along the pair (X, Y )). The mapping R: D ‚ÜíRD (resp.
T : D ‚ÜíT D), assigning to a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds its curvature (resp.
torsion), will be called curvature (resp. torsion) operator, or simply curvature
(resp. torsion).
Using (2.5), it is a simple exercise to verify that RD(X, Y ) is a tensor Ô¨Åeld
of type (1, 1), which we consider as a derivation, while T D(X, Y ) is a vector Ô¨Åeld
and their components in a local frame {Ei} are given respectively by

Since the equivalent equations (2.8) and (2.9) hold on U for a linear on
U ‚äÜM derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds, the equations (2.14) and (2.15) take

A derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds with vanishing curvature (resp. torsion) on
a set U ‚äÜM will be called Ô¨Çat, or curvature free, or integrable (resp. torsionless
or torsion free) on U. For U = M, we call it simply Ô¨Çat (resp. torsionless).

ing derivations of the tensor algebra over a manifold, the reader can Ô¨Ånd in [11].
The symmetry of the coeÔ¨Écients,

(2.18)
of a torsion free derivation in coordinate frames on the set(s) on which it is linear
is a trivial corollary from (2.15) and (2.9).

General overview
The heuristic arguments at the beginning of Section I.5, concerning linear connec-
tions, are completely applicable to the derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds. According
to them, one can expect the existence of (local) frames in which all terms except
the Ô¨Årst one in the right-hand side of (2.5) vanish. Obviously, this is equivalent to
the vanishment of the local components of a given derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds
in some frame. Further in this chapter, we shall investigate at length when such
special frames exist. Below in the present section, some general properties of these
frames will be found provided they exist.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1. Given a manifold M, a subset U ‚äÜM and a derivation D along
vector Ô¨Åelds of the tensor algebra T 1(M). A frame {Ei}, deÔ¨Åned on an open
subset of M containing U or equal to it, is called normal on U for D if in it
the components of D along every vector Ô¨Åeld X ‚ààX(M), i.e., of DX, vanish
everywhere on U. Respectively, if g: Q ‚ÜíM, Q being non-empty set, a frame
{Ei}, deÔ¨Åned on an open subset of M containing g(Q) or equal to it, is called
normal for D along g if it is normal on g(Q).
Similarly to (I.5.1), we can rewrite the Ô¨Årst part of this deÔ¨Ånition as
{Ei}
is normal on U
‚áê‚áí
ŒìX

j|U = 0
in {Ei}.
(3.1)
3It should be emphasized, equations (2.16) and (2.17) are valid only on the set(s) on which
the derivation D is linear.

(3.2)
If {Ei} is an arbitrary frame on (a neighborhood of) U ‚äÜM, then on U
exists a normal frame {E‚Ä≤
i} if and only if there is a C1 non-degenerate matrix-
valued function A = [Ai
j] transforming {Ei} into {E‚Ä≤
i}, E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej, and such that,
according to (3.1) and (2.11), satisÔ¨Åes the normal frame equation
(ŒìXA + X(A))|U = 0
(3.3)
which in component form reads (see (2.10))
(ŒìX
i
mAm
j + XmEm(Ai
j))|U = 0.
(3.3‚Ä≤)
Therefore a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits normal frames on U iÔ¨Ä(3.3)
has solutions with respect to A in some frame {Ei} and every vector Ô¨Åeld X. Prac-
tically all properties, including the existence, of the normal frames are, explicitly or
implicitly, related to the equation (3.3). Below we shall make some simple general
conclusions from it provided it has (non-degenerate) solution(s).
Proposition 3.1. Let a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds of T 1(M) admits a frame
normal on U ‚äÜM. Then the derivation D is linear on U, i.e., equation (2.9)
(or (2.8) in component form) holds for every p ‚ààU.
Proof. Let {E‚Ä≤
i} be a frame normal for D on U and {Ei} be arbitrary frame
on U. There is a C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function A = [Ai
j] such that
E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj for which (3.3) is valid. Hence, we have ŒìX|U = ‚àí[(X(A))A‚àí1]|U =
‚àí[Xk(Ek(A))A‚àí1]|U, i.e., equation (2.9) holds for
Œìk(p) = ‚àí[Ek(A)A‚àí1]|p,
p ‚ààU,
(3.4)
and hence, by DeÔ¨Ånition 2.4, the derivation D is linear on U.
‚ñ°
Thus the linearity on U of a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds is a necessary
condition for the existence of frames normal for D on U. As we shall see in the
next sections, this condition is generally not suÔ¨Écient, exceptions being the zero-
and one-dimensional cases.
Proposition 3.1 allows an essential simpliÔ¨Åcation of equation (3.3) and its
equivalent version (3.3‚Ä≤): the dependence on the arbitrary vector Ô¨Åeld X can
be removed. Indeed, if D admits normal frame(s), then ŒìX = ŒìlXl on U for
some matrix-valued functions Œì1, . . . , Œìdim M which, when inserted into (3.3), re-
duces (3.3) to
(ŒìlA + El(A))|U = 0
(3.5)

150
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
due to the arbitrariness of X1, . . . , Xdim M. Correspondingly (3.3‚Ä≤) takes the form
Œìi
mkAm
j + Ek(Ai
j))|U = 0.
(3.5‚Ä≤)
where Œìi
jk : U ‚ÜíK are the components of Œìk, Œìk = [Œìi
jk]dim M
i,j=1 , i.e., they are the
coeÔ¨Écients of the initial derivation.
Equation (3.5) is identical with equation (I.5.4), as it should be: according to
the above-said, the normal frames on U, if any, for a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds
and for a linear connection coinciding on U with D are identical. This explains why
most of the properties of the normal frames for derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds and
linear connections are similar or identical. Regardless of this, below some results,
concerning normal frames for derivations, will be proved independently, for others
a reference to the case of linear connections will be given, and, at last, to some
peculiarities of the case of derivations attention will be paid.
According to the aforesaid, if frames normal on U for D exist, they are
uniquely deÔ¨Åned by the coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
jk : U ‚ÜíK of D.
The following proposition and the Ô¨Årst corollary of it describe the set of
normal frames, in any, for a given derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds.
Proposition 3.2. Let a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits a frame normal
on U ‚äÜM. The set of all frames normal for D on U consists of the frames
that can be obtained from a Ô¨Åxed frame normal for D on U by means of linear
transformations whose matrices vanish on U under the action of the basic vector
Ô¨Åelds of the normal frames.
Proof. Suppose the frames {Ei} and {E‚Ä≤
i} are normal for D on U. Then, due
to (3.1), ŒìX|U = Œì‚Ä≤
X|U = 0 for every vector Ô¨Åeld X, so equation (3.3) reduces to
(X(A))|U = 0, A = [Ai
j]. The choice X = Ei implies Ei(A)|U = 0. The converse
assertion is almost evident: if {Ei} is normal on U, i.e., ŒìX|U = 0, and E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj
with Ei(A)|U = 0, then, from the transformation law (2.11), we get Œì‚Ä≤
X|U = 0,
i.e., the frame {E‚Ä≤
i} is normal for D on U.
‚ñ°
Corollary 3.1. All frames normal on U for some derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds,
if any, are connected via linear transformations whose coeÔ¨Écients vanish on U
under the action of the basic vector Ô¨Åelds of the normal frames.
Proof. See Proposition 3.2 or its proof.
‚ñ°
Corollary 3.2. If a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits a frame normal on
U ‚äÜM, then (2.9) holds in it with
Œìk|U = 0.
(3.6)
Proof. See Proposition 3.1, equation (3.4), and Corollary 3.1.
‚ñ°

3. General overview
151
Remark 3.1. Here and below, we suppose the derivation D and the vector Ô¨Åeld
X to be deÔ¨Åned on the whole manifold M, i.e., D: X ‚ÜíDX with DX being
derivation of T 1(M) and X ‚ààX(M). If D and X are deÔ¨Åned on a smaller set, e.g.,
on a submanifold N of M with dim N < dim M, then all of the above (and next)
results are valid mutatis mutandis provided M is replaced with N; in particular,
all frames will be deÔ¨Åned on (subsets of) N and, correspondingly, the Latin indices
i, j, . . . should run from 1 to dim N, not to dim M.
Due to equation (3.6), DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.1 is a special case of DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 when
applied to linear connections. In fact, if ‚àáis a linear connection, its components
ŒìX
i
j are deÔ¨Åned by (2.6) with ‚àáfor D and satisfy (2.8) at every point in U and for
every X ‚ààX(U). So, if ‚àáadmits frames normal on U, equation (3.6) implies that
a frame normal for ‚àáon U according to DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 is normal for ‚àáon U by
DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.1. Conversely, if ‚àáadmits frames normal on U according to DeÔ¨Åni-
tion I.5.1, by equation (2.8) they are also normal by DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1. Consequently,
DeÔ¨Ånitions 3.1 and I.5.1 are equivalent when linear connections are concerned.
Now we shall turn our attention to the holonomicity of the normal frames, if
such exist.
Proposition 3.3. Let a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits C1 frames normal on
a neighborhood U ‚äÜM. All of these frames are either holonomic or anholonomic
depending on is the torsion of D zero of non-zero on U, respectively.
Proof. Let {Ei} be a frame normal for D on U. In it, by virtue of (2.15), the
torsion along the pair (Ei, Ej) is (T D(Ei, Ej))|U = ‚àí(Ck
ijEk)|U = ‚àí([Ei, Ej] )|U
and, consequently (see (2.15)), we have (T D(X, Y ))|U = ‚àí(XiY j[Ei, Ej] )|U for
every X, Y ‚ààX(U). Therefore [Ei, Ej] |U = 0 iÔ¨ÄT D|U = 0.
‚ñ°
Remark 3.2. Remarks I.5.2 and I.5.3 are valid mutatis mutandis in a case of
derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds.
Recalling Remark I.5.1 on page 40, which is completely valid in a case of gen-
eral derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds, we have to emphasize that the (an)holonomicity
of a frame {Ei} normal on U does not imply any conclusions concerning the
(an)holonomicity of the frame {Ei} outside U if it is deÔ¨Åned on a set larger than
U. Moreover, if {Ei} is normal on U but not outside it, the derivation‚Äôs components
in {Ei} must vanish solely on U and generally are non-zero outside U.
Proposition 3.3 simply means that only the torsionless derivations along vec-
tor Ô¨Åelds admit holonomic frames normal on a neighborhood. Moreover, for these
derivations anholonomic normal frames do not exist.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2. Let D be a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds admitting normal frames.
A chart (V, x) of M and the associated to it coordinate system {xi} are called
normal (for D) on a set U ‚äÜV if the coordinate frame

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

is normal for D on U.
So, the normal coordinates are the ones for which the associated local frames
are normal. They may exist only in the torsionless case, as stated in the following
assertion.

152
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Corollary 3.3. Normal coordinates may exist on a neighborhood only for torsionless
derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds and they (locally) generate all frames normal for
them, if any.
Proof. See DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2 and Proposition 3.3.
‚ñ°
We can equivalently restate Corollary 3.3 by saying that derivations (along
vector Ô¨Åelds) with non-vanishing torsion do not admits holonomic frames normal
on a neighborhood and if for them normal frames exist, they are anholonomic.
Now we want to turn our attention to coordinates normal on a subset U ‚äÜM
which may not be a neighborhood.
The normal coordinates, if any, for a derivation (along vector Ô¨Åelds) admitting
normal frames can be found as solutions of (3.3‚Ä≤). If on U ‚äÜM normal frames
exist and (V, x) is a chart with V ‚à©U Ã∏= ‚àÖand associated coordinates {xi}, the
coordinates x‚Ä≤ i = x‚Ä≤ i(x1, . . . , xdim M) deÔ¨Åned on V are normal on U ‚à©V if and
only if (3.3‚Ä≤) holds for Ei =

(3.7)
As one can expect, this equation is identical with the normal frame equation (I.5.4‚Ä≤)
on page 41 deÔ¨Åning the normal coordinates for linear connections.
Proposition 3.4. If a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits coordinates normal on
a set U ‚äÜM, then it is torsionless on U. In other words, if D admits a holonomic
frame normal on U, it is torsion free on U.
Proof. If p ‚ààU and {x‚Ä≤ i} are coordinates in a neighborhood of p normal on U,
then (3.7) is valid. Antisymmetrizing this equation with respect to j and k, we Ô¨Ånd
Œìi
[mn]|U = 0. Combining the last result with (2.17) and (I.3.14), we get T |U = 0
as in a holonomic frame, like

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

in (3.7), is fulÔ¨Ålled Ci
jk = 0.
‚ñ°
The last proposition immediately implies the following assertion.
Corollary 3.4. If U ‚äÜM, only the torsionless on U derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds
may admit frames which are normal and holonomic on U.
Later it will be proved that the vanishment of the torsion on a submanifold
is also a suÔ¨Écient condition for the existence of normal coordinates for derivations
along vector Ô¨Åelds admitting frames normal on them.
1The same result follows also from (3.5‚Ä≤) for Ei = ‚àÇ/‚àÇxi and Aj
i = ‚àÇxj/‚àÇ‚Ä≤xi.

4. Frames and coordinates normal at a point
153
If a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits frames normal on U ‚äÜM, it is a
linear connection on U, as pointed above. To this connection corresponds a parallel
transport (see Subsection I.3.3) for which in ex. are valid the results concerning
parallel transports and normal frames of Section I.5 (see page 42 and further). In
particular, Propositions I.5.5 and I.5.6 remain true for the parallel transport in U
associate to D.
4.
Frames and coordinates normal at a point
From the considerations in the previous section and Subsection II.2.2, we can
expect the existence of frames normal for every derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds
at every Ô¨Åxed point p in a C2 manifold M provided D is linear at p, i.e.,
ŒìX(p) = Xk(p)Œìk
(4.1)
in every frame for some constant dim M √ó dim M matrices Œì1, . . . , Œìdim M. Below
we shall see that just this is the situation, which can be proved in a number of
ways.
Theorem 4.1. Let M be a C2 manifold, p be a given point in M, and D be a
derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds of T 1(M). There exist frames normal for D at p if
and only if D is linear at p. Moreover, if D is linear at p and (V, x) is a chart
with V ‚àãp, then in V all frames normal for D at p are

Ei = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj

where
A := [Aj
i]: V ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K) is of class C1, non-degenerate, and its general
form is
A(q) =

1 ‚àíŒìj[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)]

A0
+ Ajk(q)[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)][xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)],
q ‚ààV
(4.2)
where Œì1, . . . , Œìdim M are the (constant ) matrices of the coeÔ¨Écients of D given
via (4.1), A0 is a constant non-degenerate matrix, and Ajk are C1 matrix-valued
functions on U such that they and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded at p.
Proof. If D admits frames normal at p, by Proposition 3.1, it is linear at p, i.e.,
(4.1) holds. Conversely, if D is linear at p and (V, x) is a chart with p in its
domain, a frame

Ei = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj

is normal for D at p iÔ¨ÄA = [Aj
i] satisÔ¨Åes (3.5)
with U = {p}. In the proof of Theorem II.2.3 (p. 82), we proved that this equation
always has solutions in V , the general one being given by (4.2) (see (II.2.14) with
Œìj for Œìj(p) and V for U).
‚ñ°
Theorem 4.1 provides a complete description of all frames normal at a single
point for a given derivation (along vector Ô¨Åelds) linear at this point. By Corol-
lary 3.1, these frames are connected via linear transformations whose matrices
vanish at the given point under the action of the basic vector Ô¨Åelds of the normal

154
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
frames.1 According to Corollary 3.4 for U = {p}, the frames normal at a single
point p and holonomic at p exist if the derivation is torsionless at p.
In the torsion free case, the linear derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds admit normal
coordinates at every Ô¨Åxed point p, which coordinates are solutions of (3.7) for U =
{p} with respect to x‚Ä≤ i.2 Equivalently, in this case, coordinates {yi} normal at p
can be found by transforming some local coordinates xi, deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood
of p, in such a way that the transformation {xi} ‚Üí{yi} leads to the vanishment at
p of the derivation‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écients in {yi}. Since they change according to (I.3.5), this
problem is solved in the discussion preceding Proposition II.2.3 (see the paragraph
containing equation (II.2.11) on page 80). So, the general form of the coordinates
{yi} normal at p is given by equation (II.2.11‚Ä≤) on page 80 in which
xŒìl
(ij)(p)
should be replace with the coeÔ¨Écients xŒìl
ij of the derivation (along vector Ô¨Åelds)
at p. In this way we have proved the following theorem generalizing Theorem II.2.1.
Theorem 4.2. Let M be a C3 manifold, p ‚ààM and D be torsionless and linear
at p derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds. There exist coordinates {yi} normal at p for D
whose general form is
yi(q) = yi(p) + bi
j[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)]
+ bi
l
xŒìl
jk[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)][xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)]
+ bi
jkl(q)[xj(q) ‚àíxj(p)][xk(q) ‚àíxk(p)][xl(q) ‚àíxl(p)],
(4.3)
where yi(p) are constant numbers, xi are arbitrarily chosen local coordinates in
some neighborhood V of p, q ‚ààV , [bj
i] is constant non-degenerate matrix,
xŒìl
jk
are the coeÔ¨Écients of D at p in {xi}, and the C3 functions bi
jkl : V ‚ÜíK together
with their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded at p.
This result gives a complete description of all coordinates normal at a single
point for torsionless and linear at it derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds.
Following the discussion before Proposition II.2.3, Theorem 4.2 can be slight-
ly generalized: if D is arbitrary, with or without torsion, derivation linear at p,
there exist local coordinates {yi} in which the symmetric part of the coeÔ¨Écients of
D, i.e.,
yŒìl
(jk) := 1
2
 yŒìl
jk +
yŒìl
kj

, vanish at p and their general form is (4.3) (in
which
xŒìl
jk may be replaced with
xŒìl
(jk)). But these coordinates are not normal
for D at p unless D is torsionless at p.
5.
Frames and coordinates normal along paths
Relaying on the results of Section 3 and Subsection II.3.2, we may assume the
existence of normal frames along a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM for a derivation D along
1This result is also a consequence of (3.5) and (3.6) for U = {p}.
2The vanishment of the torsion plays a role of an integrability condition for (3.7) with U = {p}.

5. Frames and coordinates normal along paths
155
vector Ô¨Åelds provided D is linear along Œ≥, i.e., on the set Œ≥(J):
ŒìX(Œ≥(s)) = Œìk(Œ≥(s))Xk(Œ≥(s)),
s ‚ààJ
(5.1)
for some matrix-valued functions Œìk on Œ≥(J), ŒìX being the matrix (of the compo-
nents) of D in a frame {Ei} deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood of Œ≥(J). (Notice, we suppose
D to be linear on Œ≥(J) but outside Œ≥(J) it could not be such.) The truthfulness
of this supposition is veriÔ¨Åed by the results presented below.
In this section, as in Section II.3 (see p. 85), the manifold M will be considered
as real one, i.e., as real manifold of dimension dimR M. (Recall, dimR M = dim M
if M is real and dimR M = 2 dim M = 2 dimC M if M is complex; see also p. 7.)
Theorem 5.1. Let M be C2-manifold, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be C1 regular path without
self-intersections, and D be C0, i.e., continuous, derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds
of T 1(M). There exist frames (locally) normal for D along Œ≥ if and only if D is
linear along Œ≥, that is on Œ≥(J). Moreover, if D is linear along Œ≥, for every s0 ‚ààJ,
there exist neighborhood U1 of Œ≥(s0) and a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} on U1 which is normal
for D along Œ≥ in U1, i.e., on U1 ‚à©Œ≥(J). Besides, there exist subinterval J1 ‚äÜJ
with Œ≥(J1) = U1 ‚à©Œ≥(J) and a chart (U1, x) with associated coordinates {xi} in
U1 in which Œ≥1(s) = s, the other components of Œ≥(s) being constants, such that
all of the mentioned normal frames are

, where p ‚ààU1 and
the C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function A = [Aj
i]: U1 ‚ÜíGL(dimR M, R) is
given by
A(p) =

1 ‚àíŒìk(p0)[xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)]

Y (x1(p), s0; ‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥)B
+ Bkl(p)[xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)][xl(p) ‚àíxl(p0)].
(5.2)
Here 1 is the identity (unit) matrix, Œìk are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of D (see
equation (5.1)), p = x‚àí1(s, t) ‚ààU1 with s ‚ààJ1 and t ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1, p0 = Œ≥(s) =
x‚àí1(s, t0) for Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1, Y is the unique solution of the initial-value
problem (II.3.17) with s = x1(p) and Z = ‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥, B is constant non-degenerate
matrix, and the matrix valued functions Bkl on U1 are of class C1 and they and
their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bonded on Œ≥(J1).
Proof. If frames (locally) normal for D along Œ≥ exist, by Proposition 3.1 the deriva-
tion D is linear along Œ≥, i.e., (5.1) holds.
Suppose D is linear along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM. Let {Ei} be a frame deÔ¨Åned on a
neighborhood of Œ≥(J). As it was proved in Section 3, D admits frames {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj

normal along Œ≥ if there exist non-degenerate matrix-valued C1 functions A = [Aj
i]
which satisfy equation (3.5) for U = Œ≥(J), i.e.,
Œìk(Œ≥(s))A(Œ≥(s)) + E(A)|Œ≥(s) = 0
(5.3)
for s ‚ààJ. So, D admits frames normal along Œ≥ iÔ¨Äthis equation has solutions with
respect to A for some {Ei}. Besides, these solutions, if any, describe all such normal

frames. In Subsection II.3.2 (see the paragraph containing equation (II.3.12) on
page 94), we proved that for every s0 ‚ààJ there exist a subinterval J1 ‚äÜJ
with J1 ‚àãs0, neighborhood U1 ‚äÉŒ≥(J1) = Œ≥(J) ‚à©U1, and local chart (U1, x)
with coordinate functions (II.3.12) in which the components of Œ≥(s), s ‚ààJ1, are
Œ≥1(s) = s and Œ≥k(s) = tk
0 for some constant numbers tk for k ‚â•2 (see (II.3.13))
and every point p ‚ààU1 has coordinates of the form x(p) = (s, t) for some s ‚ààJ1
and t ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1.
Further, it was proved in Subsection II.3.2 that (5.3) for Ek =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxk reduces
to the system (II.3.16) which always has solutions, the general one being given
by (5.2) (see the discussion before (II.3.23)).
‚ñ°
Now the discussion between Theorems II.3.1 on page 97 and II.3.2 on page 99
can be repeated in extenso for derivations (along vector Ô¨Åelds) linear along a given
path Œ≥. Below we summarize the main results of it.
The holonomicity of the (local) frames normal along Œ≥ for D depends on the
torsion of D on Œ≥(J): if D is torsion free on Œ≥(J), i.e., along Œ≥, these frames are
holonomic and, correspondingly, along Œ≥ exist normal coordinates; otherwise, if
D has non-vanishing torsion along Œ≥, the mentioned frames are anholonomic. It
should be emphasized that the holonomicity of the normal frames on Œ≥(J) does not
imply some conclusions of their holonomicity outside the set Œ≥(J) where they can
be holonomic or anholonomic depending on the free parameters B and Bkl in (5.2).
The normal frames provided by Theorem 5.1 are essentially local: they exist
in the corresponding local coordinate neighborhoods and only as an exception
such a neighborhood may contain the whole path Œ≥. Covering the set Œ≥(J) with
coordinate neighborhoods of this kind and taking a normal frame in each of them,1
we can construct all frames globally normal along Œ≥. These global normal frames
may turn not to be smooth in the region(s) of intersection of the domains of the
local coordinate neighborhoods.
The above concerns injective paths, i.e., ones without self-intersections. This
restriction can be weakened considerably: the results are valid mutatis mutandis
for locally injective paths. For this end, the interval J has to be presented as a
union of subintervals JŒª, Œª‚ààŒõ, such that the restricted paths Œ≥|JŒª are without self-
intersections. So the afore-given construction of, possibly global, normal frames is
applicable for Œ≥|JŒª. From the frames normal along Œ≥|JŒª all frames globally normal
along the whole path Œ≥ can be constructed. The details of this scheme are given
before Theorem II.3.2 on page 99 whose version for derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds
reads:
Theorem 5.2. Let M be C2 manifold, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be locally injective, C1, and reg-
ular path, and D be C0 derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds. There exist frames (globally,
i.e., on Œ≥(J)) normal for D along the whole path Œ≥ iÔ¨ÄD is linear along Œ≥. Locally
these frames, described via Theorem 5.1, are of class C1 but globally they may not
be such. Frames normal and holonomic along Œ≥ exist iÔ¨ÄD is torsion free on Œ≥(J).
1In the region(s) of intersection, we arbitrarily Ô¨Åx (choose) some frame normal in it (them).

6. Frames normal in a neighborhood
157
As was proved above, a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds which is linear and
torsion free along regular locally injective path Œ≥ admits holonomic frames normal
along Œ≥. Since these frames coincide with the ones for a linear connection ‚àáwith
the same coeÔ¨Écients along Œ≥ as those of D, the corresponding normal coordinates,
locally generating the holonomic normal frames, for ‚àáand D coincide. The normal
coordinates for a symmetric C0 linear connection are described by Theorem II.3.3
on page 103. Hence the normal coordinates for derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds are
given via the same theorem with the only change that the words ‚Äúsymmetric linear
connection‚Äù must be replace with ‚Äúderivation along vector Ô¨Åelds which is linear
and torsionless along Œ≥‚Äù.
6.
Frames and coordinates normal in a neighborhood
The main result concerning the existence of frames normal for derivations along
vector Ô¨Åelds in a neighborhood, or submanifold of maximum dimensionality, is
that the Ô¨Çat linear connections are the only derivations admitting normal frames
on them.
Theorem 6.1. Let M be C3 manifold, D be C1 derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds on
M, and U be (dim M)-dimensional submanifold of M. There exist frames normal
for D on U if and only if the restriction of D to U, i.e., to T 1(U), is a Ô¨Çat linear
connection.
Proof. Suppose there is a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} normal for D on U. By Proposition 3.1 and its
proof, D is linear on U and in an arbitrary frame {Ei = (A‚àí1)j
iE‚Ä≤
j} its coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô
matrices are given by (3.4). Hence D reduces on U to a linear connection ‚àá
with coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices (3.4) in {Ei} and whose curvature, according to (II.4.1)
and (3.4), has in {Ei} components Ri
jkl such that on U is fulÔ¨Ålled
Rkl := [Ri
jkl]
=

2El[+(Ek(A))A‚àí1] + 2(Ek(A))A‚àí1(El(A))A‚àí1 + Cm
kl(Em(A))A‚àí1
[kl]

2(E[lEk])(A) + Cm
klEm(A)

A‚àí1 ‚â°0
where [Ei, Ej] = 2E[i ‚ó¶Ej] = Ck
ijEk was used. Consequently ‚àá(and also D) is
Ô¨Çat on U.
Conversely, if D is a Ô¨Çat linear connection on U, by Theorem II.4.1, on U
exist frames normal for this linear connection which, by virtue of (2.9), are also
normal for D on U.
‚ñ°
Theorem 6.1 reduces all problems concerning normal frames, if any, for
derivations (along vector Ô¨Åelds) on submanifolds of maximum dimension to the
same problems for (Ô¨Çat) linear connections. Since the last range of problems was

158
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
completely investigated in Section II.4, we are not going to repeat them and the
corresponding discussion here. We shall only summarize the main points of them
as the following exercises.
Exercise 6.1. Prove that every C1 Ô¨Çat linear derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds on a C3
manifold admits (global) normal frames as, in fact, it is a Ô¨Çat linear connection.
(See Theorem 6.1 and Corollary II.4.1.)
Exercise 6.2. Prove that all frames {E‚Ä≤
i} normal for a C1 Ô¨Çat linear derivation on
an (dim M)-dimensional submanifold U are {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj}, where {Ei} is a frame
on U and A = [Aj
i]: U ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K) is given by (II.4.11) in which p ‚ààU,
p0 ‚ààU is Ô¨Åxed, B ‚ààGL(dim M, K), Œìk are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices in {Ei}, and
Y is the solution of (II.4.4) with q = p, q0 = p0, N = M, ea = Ea, and Za = ‚àíŒìa
where a = 1, . . . , dim M. (See Theorems 6.1 and II.4.2.)
Exercise 6.3. Prove that, if a C1 derivation which is linear, Ô¨Çat and torsionless in
the domain U of some local chart (U, x) of a C3 manifold, then it admits in U
normal coordinates which can be obtained from {xi} via (II.4.14) with ai ‚ààK.
7.
Frames and coordinates normal on submanifolds
As a consequence of the general constructions in Section 3, the equations describ-
ing frames normal on a submanifold U, if any, for derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds
coincide with the ones for a linear connection with the same coeÔ¨Écients on U.
This allows an almost obvious direct transferring of the results obtained for linear
connections to the general case of arbitrary derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds. Here is
a list of the main of them.
Theorem 7.1. Let N be submanifold of C3 manifold M and D be C1 derivation
along vector Ô¨Åelds of T 1(M). Then:
(i) There exist frames normal for D on N if and only if it is linear on N and
it‚Äôs curvature vanishes on N along vector Ô¨Åelds tangent to N as a manifold:

RD(X, Y )
		
q = 0,
Xq, Yq ‚ààTq(N),
q ‚ààN ‚äÜM.
(7.1)
(ii) If D admits frames normal on N, every point q0 ‚ààN has a neighborhood
UN in M such that on UN exist C1 frames normal for D on N, i.e., on
¬ØU = UN ‚à©N ‚àãq0. Moreover, on UN exist coordinates {xi} such that:
(a) to every p = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤), (s, t‚Ä≤) ‚ààWN √ó W ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜKdim N √ó Kdim M‚àídim N
corresponds a unique point p0 = x‚àí1(s, t‚Ä≤
0) ‚àà¬ØU for some t‚Ä≤
0 ‚ààW ‚Ä≤
independent of t‚Ä≤ and

(7.2)
Here Œìk are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of D, Y is the unique solution of equa-
tion (II.5.9a) with A = Y and initial condition (II.5.9c) on page 122, ( ¬ØUN, ¬Øx) is
the chart of N induced by (UN, x), s0 = ¬Øx(q0), B is bounded matrix-valued func-
tion, and the matrix-valued functions Bkl on UN are of class C1 and they and
their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded on ¬ØUN.
Proof. Let {Ei} be a frame on (a neighborhood of) N. Suppose D admits a frame
{E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej} normal on N. By Proposition 3.1, the derivation D is linear on N
and, according to the results after it, the matrix A = [Aj
i ] satisÔ¨Åes the normal
frame equation (3.5) with U = N, viz.
Œìk(p)A(p) + (Ek(A))|p = 0
p ‚ààN.
(7.3)
In Subsection II.5.2, we proved that this equation, written there as (II.5.7), has
solutions iÔ¨Äthe integrability conditions (II.5.1) hold with R being the curvature
tensor of a linear connection on M whose coeÔ¨Écients, when restricted to N, coin-
cide with the ones of D. Because of (2.16), the conditions (II.5.1) are equivalent
to (7.1). Consequently, as A satisÔ¨Åes (II.5.7) with Œìk being the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô ma-
trices of D, the equality (7.1) holds. Conversely, let the derivation D be linear
with coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices Œìk and (7.1) be valid. Then, as we just said, the equa-
tion (7.3) admits solutions with respect to A. If A is such a solution, the frame
{E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} is normal for D on N due to (2.11) and (2.9). This completes the
Ô¨Årst part of the theorem‚Äôs proof.
Now suppose D admits frames normal on N. Then D is linear on N and
equation (7.1) and its equivalent version (II.5.1) hold. Then Theorem II.5.2 is
valid for a connection whose coeÔ¨Écients on N coincide with the ones of D. Hence
the coordinates with the properties (a) exist and in them, i.e., for Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi , the
general solution of (7.3) is given via (7.2). So, the frames {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} on UN
with A = [Aj
i ] given by (7.2) are normal on ¬ØU = UN ‚à©N for D and on UN there
are not other frames with this property.
‚ñ°
Combining Theorem 7.1 with Corollaries II.5.1 and II.5.2, we can formulate
the following result.
Corollary 7.1. Let N be a submanifold of a C3 manifold M endowed with C1
derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds which is linear on N. Suppose ‚àáis a linear con-
nection on M and the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáon N coincide with the ones of D. Then
on (a neighborhood of) N exist frames normal for D if and only if on N exists a
frame parallel with respect to ‚àáor, equivalently, iÔ¨Äthe parallel transport generated
by ‚àáis path-independent on N along all paths lying entirely in N.

160
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
If a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds admits frames normal on a submanifold N,
Assertion (ii) of Theorem 7.1 gives a complete local description of all such frames.
Exercise 7.1. Using the explicit form (7.2) of the transformation matrix A, prove
the validity of Proposition 3.2 and Corollary 3.1 on submanifolds; this is reÔ¨Çected
in the constancy of the matrix B(t‚Ä≤
0) in (7.2) for a Ô¨Åxed choice of the local coor-
dinates {xi}.
Exercise 7.2. Construct a frame globally normal on the whole N from the frames
locally normal on N. The idea is to take a system of overlapping (coordinate)
neighborhoods, forming a neighborhood of N, on each of which C1 normal frames
exist and from these local normal frames to be constructed a global frame normal
on N. In this way all frames globally normal on N can be obtained, the details of
this construction were explained after the proof of Corollary II.5.2.
If a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits frames normal on a submanifold
N, there are holonomic frames normal on N iÔ¨ÄD has zero torsion on N (see
Corollary 3.4). Since the normal frames for derivations, linear on N for which (7.1)
holds, and linear connections, with the same coeÔ¨Écients on N, coincide in the
torsionless case, the corresponding normal coordinates for them coincide too. All of
these normal coordinates {zi} can be found explicitly by integrating the equation

q =

j, where q ‚àà¬ØU and A is given by (7.2), with respect to zi in some
neighborhood Uz of ¬ØU in UN with Uz ‚à©N = ¬ØU (see (II.5.12)); for the notation see
Theorem 7.1. This system of equations was completely solved in Subsection II.5.2
(see pages 124‚Äì126) and its general solution is (II.5.16). This result, combined
with the just said in this paragraph, completes the proof of the following theorem
(cf. Theorem II.5.3 on page 124).
Theorem 7.2. Let N be a submanifold of a C3 manifold M and D be a C1 deriva-
tion along vector Ô¨Åelds such that on N it is linear, torsionless and (7.1) holds. For
every point q ‚ààN exists a chart (Uz, z) of M, with q in its domain Uz, which is
normal for D on Uz ‚à©N. Moreover, the coordinate functions zi : Uz ‚ÜíK of all

Frames and coordinates normal along mappings
In Section 5, we have investigated the problems of existence, uniqueness, and
holonomicity of frames normal along a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM for a derivation D along
vector Ô¨Åelds. The aim of the present section is a generalization of these results
for frames normal along suÔ¨Éciently general mappings Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM or f : N ‚ÜíM
where Jn is a neighborhood in Rn (or n-dimensional submanifold of Rn) and N is
n-dimensional manifold for some integer n ‚àà{1, . . ., dim M}. Obviously, the choice
n = 1 and an open interval for J1 returns us to Section 5.1 If we suppose Œ≥(Jn) to
be a single point or, more generally, an n-dimensional submanifold of M (and Œ≥ to
be injective in the last case),2 the results of Sections 4 and 7, respectively, should
be reproduced. Relaying on these special cases, we can expect that for n = 0, 1
the linearity of the derivation should be a necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for
the existence of frames normal along Œ≥, while for n ‚â•2 (if dim M ‚â•2) this might
not be the general case.
Now the rigorous statements are in order.
Recall, according to DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1, we say that a frames {Ei} is normal along
a mapping g: Q ‚ÜíM, Q being non-empty set, for a derivation D along vector
Ô¨Åelds of T 1(M) if it is deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood of g(Q) (or on M if g(Q) = M)
and in it the components of D along every vector Ô¨Åeld vanish everywhere on the
set g(Q).
By Proposition 3.1, a necessary condition for the existence of frames normal
along a mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM is the linearity of D along Œ≥, i.e.,
ŒìX(Œ≥(s)) = Œìk(Œ≥(s))Xk(Œ≥(s)),
s ‚ààJn
(8.1)
in an arbitrary frame {Ei}. Here ŒìX is the components‚Äô matrix of D in it, X ‚àà
X(M), and Œìk are matrix-valued functions on Œ≥(Jn) which are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô
matrices of D.
From Section 3, we know that a linear derivation D admits normal frames
along Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM iÔ¨Äfor some (and hence for every) frame {Ei} there exists
a non-degenerate matrix-valued function A = [Ai
j] such that the normal frame
equation (3.5) holds along Œ≥, viz.
(ŒìkA + Ek(A))|Œ≥(Jn) = 0
(8.2)
or
Œìk(Œ≥(s))A(Œ≥(s)) + Ek(A))|Œ≥(s) = 0,
s ‚ààJn.
(8.2‚Ä≤)
1In Section 5 the interval J1 ‚â°J is of arbitrary type, i.e., it may be open or closed from one
or both ends. To incorporate the last case, when J1 is closed from the left or/and right, as a
special case of the next considerations, we must admit Jn to be n-dimensional submanifold with
boundary in Rn. The following results can be modiÔ¨Åed to cover this more general case, which
we leave to the reader as an exercise. (See Remark I.2.1 on page 6 for the notion of a manifold
with boundary.)
2The set Œ≥(Jn) is a submanifold if, for instance, Œ≥ is a regular embedding [12, p. 230].

162
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
If (8.2) has solutions with respect to A, all frames {E‚Ä≤
i} normal for D along Œ≥ are
{E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} for some A satisfying (8.2).
Since the system of equations (8.2) is a multidimensional generalization
of (II.3.11), corresponding to n = 1, we shall partially follow the scheme of Sub-
section II.3.2.
The problem is to Ô¨Ånd, if any, all frames normal along a mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM
for a C1 linear derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds on a C3 manifold M. The next two
subsections deal with the case when Œ≥ is respectively injective or locally injective
while Subsection 8.3 investigates the case of a mapping f : N ‚ÜíM between
manifolds instead of Œ≥.
In the present section, to detour some technical problems,3 we shall look
on the manifold M as on a real one, i.e., if M is real, no changes are necessary
and, if M is complex, we consider it as a real manifold of dimension dimR M =
2 dim M ‚â°2 dimC M (see p. 7). Below this will be formally reÔ¨Çected in writing
dimR M instead of dim M. (Recall, dimR M is equal to dim M if M is real or to
2 dimC M ‚â°2 dim M if M is complex.) Respectively, all Latin indices, with not
explicitly speciÔ¨Åed range, run from 1 to dimR M and the ranges of the coordinate
homeomorphisms lie in RdimR M. In short, in the present section M is real manifold
or complex manifold which we consider as real manifold of dimension dimR M and
endowed with a real diÔ¨Äerentiable structure.
8.1.
Injective mappings
At Ô¨Årst we suppose the mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM to be injective, i.e., without self-
intersections: if s1, s2 ‚ààJn and s1 Ã∏= s2, then Œ≥(s1) Ã∏= Œ≥(s2). This requires n =
dim Jn ‚â§dimR M; otherwise Œ≥ can not be 1:1. Below we are going to study and
solve equation (8.2‚Ä≤), if it has solutions, in a frame {Ei} associated to a special
kind of local coordinates. More precisely, we are going to show that Œ≥(Jn) is n-
dimensional submanifold of M (in a sense of our deÔ¨Ånition on page 7) and then
to apply the results of Subsection II.5.2 or of Section 7.
Let Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM be C1 regular injective mapping from a neighborhood Jn ‚äÜ
Rn on a C3 manifold M with dimR M ‚â•n. Consider Jn as an n-dimensional
manifold with a global chart (Jn, idJn) and standard coordinate functions ra, a =
1, . . . , n, such that ra(s) = sa for s = (s1, . . . , sn) ‚ààJn. If (U, y), y: U ‚ÜíRdimR M,
is a chart of M with U ‚à©Œ≥(Jn) Ã∏= ‚àÖand associated coordinate functions yi,
the regularity of Œ≥ implies (see p. 15) that the Jacobi matrix of Œ≥ in the charts
introduced, i.e.,
 ‚àÇ(yi‚ó¶Œ≥)

=
 ‚àÇŒ≥i
y

where Œ≥i
y := yi ‚ó¶Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíR and here and
3For instance, if Œ≥ is (locally) injective, C1 and regular, the set Œ≥(Jn) is a submanifold of M
and, roughly speaking, its real dimension is dimR(Œ≥(Jn)) = n while its complex dimension, if
M is complex, is dimC(Œ≥(Jn)) = n/2 which is not an integer for odd n. Besides, for complex M
and odd n, the below-constructed chart (U1, x), which plays a crucial role in proving most of the
results in this section, requires a complicated redeÔ¨Ånition if we do not look on M as on a real
manifold. (If n is even, the almost only change in the complex case is to replace dimR M ‚àín with
dim M ‚àín/2 and to identify the neighborhoods Jn in Rn with some neighborhoods in Cn/2.)

below a, b, c = 1, . . . , n and i, j, k, l = 1, . . . , dimR M if the index ranges are not
explicitly written, has a rank equal to n(‚â§dimR M) whenever s is such that
Œ≥(s) ‚ààU ‚à©Œ≥(Jn).
Lemma 8.1. Let n ‚ààN, M be a C3 manifold with dim M ‚â•n, and Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM
be C1 regular injective mapping. For every s0 ‚ààJn, there exists a chart (U1, x) of
M such that Œ≥(s0) ‚ààU1, x: U1 ‚ÜíJn

Remark 8.1. This lemma is a multidimensional generalization of Lemma II.3.1 on
page 94, which is its special case for n = 1.
Proof. Let us arbitrarily choose some s0 ‚ààJn and a chart (U, y) with U ‚àãŒ≥(s0)
and y: U ‚ÜíRdimR M. Since the regularity of Œ≥ at s0 means that

The coordinates {xi} can be expressed through {yi} explicitly. Indeed, writing the

and using that (Œ≥1

(8.3b‚Ä≤)
Using (8.3), we see that the local coordinates of Œ≥(s) for s = (s1, . . . , sn) ‚ààJn

in (U1, x) are
Œ≥a(s) := xa(Œ≥(s)) = sa,
Œ≥k(s) := xk(Œ≥(s)) = tk

i.e., x(Œ≥(s)) = (s, t0) for some Ô¨Åxed t0 = (tn+1

‚ñ°
Thus, in the chart (U1, x) or in the coordinates {xi} constructed above,
the Ô¨Årst n coordinates of a point lying in Œ≥(Jn), i.e., in Œ≥(Jn
1 ), coincide with
the corresponding parameters s1, . . . , sn of Œ≥, the remaining coordinates, if any,
being constant numbers. This conclusion allows locally, in U1, the mapping Œ≥
to be considered as a representative of a family of mappings Œ∑( ¬∑ , t): Jn
1 ‚ÜíM,
t ‚ààRdimR M‚àín, deÔ¨Åned by Œ∑(s, t) := x‚àí1(s, t) for (s, t) ‚ààJn
1 √ó RdimR M‚àín. In fact,
we have Œ≥ = Œ∑( ¬∑ , t0) or Œ≥(s) = Œ∑(s, t0).6
It is almost evident, for C1 regular injective mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM, the set
Œ≥(Jn) is an n-dimensional submanifold of M (in a sense of the deÔ¨Ånition on page 7).
Indeed, for every point p = Œ≥(s0) ‚ààŒ≥(Jn), s0 ‚ààJn, we can construct the afore-
described chart (U1, x) which is such that (vide supra) p ‚ààU1 and
Œ≥(Jn) ‚à©U1 = Œ≥(Jn

Let us return to our initial problem, the existence and description of normal
frames and coordinates, if any, along the mapping Œ≥. One can solve it by continuing
the analogy with the material of Subsection II.3.2 and its multidimensional gener-
alization. We leave this method to the reader as an exercise; in this way he/she can
independently verify the below-presented assertions.7 Alternatively, we are going
to apply the already obtained results of Section 7 (or Section II.5).
6In [83] the existence of Œ∑ is taken as a given fact without proof.
7If one follows this way, Lemma II.4.1 should be used instead of Lemma II.3.2.

8. Frames normal along mappings
165
Since Œ≥(Jn) is n-submanifold of M, if the C1 regular mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM is
injective, for the problems concerning frames normal along Œ≥ are completely valid
and applicable the results of Section 7. We shall partially reproduce them for the
mentioned range of problems utilizing the above-introduced special chart (U1, x).
Theorem 8.1. Let M be C3 manifold endowed with C1 derivation D along vector
Ô¨Åelds and the mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM be injective, C1, and regular. Then:
(i) There exist frames normal for D along Œ≥ if and only if D is linear along Œ≥,
i.e., on Œ≥(Jn), and it is curvature free on Œ≥(Jn) as a manifold,

lent to
[Rab(‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥, . . . , ‚àíŒìn ‚ó¶Œ≥)](s) = 0,
a, b = 1, . . . , n
(8.6)
where s = (s1, . . . , sn) ‚ààJn
1 with Œ≥(Jn
1 ) = U1 ‚à©Œ≥(Jn) and
[Rab(Œì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥, . . . , Œìn ‚ó¶Œ≥)]|s :=

(ii) If D admits frames normal along Œ≥, for every s1 ‚ààJn, there exists a chart
(U1, x), the same as in Assertion (i), with U1 ‚àãŒ≥(s1) such that:
(a) In the associated coordinates {xi}, every p ‚ààU1 has coordinates x(p) =
(s, t) for some s ‚ààJn
1 , where Jn

1 ),
t ‚ààRdimR M‚àín, and the coordinates of Œ≥(s), s ‚ààJn

(b) All frames normal for D along Œ≥ in U1, i.e., normal on Œ≥(Jn

Remark 8.2. The fact that in (8.8) the summations are only over the range n +
1, . . . , dimR M and in Y enter only Œì1, . . . , Œìn is a consequence of the special
choice of the coordinates {yi} used in the construction of {xi}: we have admitted

Ã∏= 0, ‚àû. If we have chosen another non-degenerate nth-order submatrix
of
 ‚àÇŒ≥i
y
‚àÇsb
		
s0

, this will result in the corresponding changes in the summation ranges
and in the indices of the Œì‚Äôs in (8.8).
Proof. Since Œ≥(Jn) is n-dimensional submanifold of M, which was proved earlier,
by Theorem 7.1 (i) the condition (8.5) and the linearity of D on Œ≥(Jn) are necessary
and suÔ¨Écient for the existence of frames normal for D along Œ≥. By (2.16), equa-
tion (8.5) is equivalent to Ri
jkl|Œ≥(Jn) = 0 (cf. (II.5.1‚Ä≤) on page 113 with N = Œ≥(Jn))
in any chart (U, y) of M with U ‚à©Œ≥(Jn) Ã∏= ‚àÖ. So, according to Remark II.5.3 on
page 114, the condition (8.5) is equivalent to (II.5.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤) on page 114 with N = Œ≥(Jn),
which in the particular chart (U1, x) takes the form (8.6).
Suppose now D admits frames normal along Œ≥; so it is linear along Œ≥ and (8.6)
holds.
The existence and explicit construction of a chart (U1, x) with the properties
described in (ii), point (a), was presented in the proof of Lemma 8.1 and it is given
by (8.3) in terms of some other chart (U, y). To prove the rest of the assertion, i.e.,
point (b) of (ii), we have to demonstrate that (8.8) is the general solution of (8.2‚Ä≤)
with Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi , {xi} being the associated to (U1, x) local coordinates. It is almost
evident, this proof is contained in the discussion preceding Theorem II.5.2 in Sub-
section II.5.2. Indeed, in it we proved that (II.5.11) is the general solution of (II.5.7)
on a submanifold N of M in a chart (UN, x) described there. If we put N = Œ≥(Jn),
then equation (II.5.7) reduces to (8.2‚Ä≤) and the chart (U1, x) introduced above is a
concrete realization of (UN, x) for t‚Ä≤
0 = t0. Therefore (II.5.11), with p = x‚àí1(s, t),
p0 = x‚àí1(s, t0) = Œ≥(s), t‚Ä≤
0 = t0, and ¬Øx(p0) = s, is the general solution of (8.2‚Ä≤).
Taking into account (8.4) and x(p) = (s, t) = (s1, . . . , sn, tn+1, . . . , tdimR M), we
conclude that in this case (8.8) is an equivalent representation of the matrix-valued
function A: U1 ‚ÜíGL(dimR M, R) given by (II.5.11).
‚ñ°
Remark 8.3. An independent proof of Theorem 8.1 is presented in [83].
Corollary 8.1. Let Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM be a C1 regular injective mapping in C3 manifold M
endowed with linear on Œ≥(Jn) C1 derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds and ‚àábe a linear
connection coinciding on Œ≥(Jn) with D. For D exist frames normal along Œ≥ iÔ¨Äthere
exists a frame parallel on Œ≥(Jn) with respect to ‚àáor iÔ¨Äthe parallel transport gen-
erated by ‚àáis path-independent on Œ≥(Jn) along the paths lying entirely in Œ≥(Jn).

8. Frames normal along mappings
167
Proof. Use that Œ≥(Jn) is a submanifold of M and see Corollary 7.1 for N = Œ≥(Jn)
or Theorem 8.1 (ii) and Lemma II.5.1.
‚ñ°
If a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits frames normal along regular
C1 injective mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM, Theorem 8.1 (ii) provides a complete local
description of all such frames. A frame {Eg
i } globally normal along the whole
mapping Œ≥ can be constructed by covering the set Œ≥(Jn) by a set {U Œª|Œª ‚ààŒõ} of
overlapping coordinate neighborhoods, like U1 above, in which exist frames {EŒª
i }
normal along the ‚Äòpart‚Äô of Œ≥ in them and then letting Eg
i |p = EŒª
i |p if p is in a single
neighborhood U Œª and, if the sets U Œª with U Œª ‚àãp are more than one, we arbitrary
choose some of them. The obtained in this way frame globally normal along Œ≥ is
deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood of Œ≥(Jn) equal to the union of the neighborhoods U Œª on
which the local normal frames forming it are deÔ¨Åned. In this way all frames globally
normal along Œ≥ can be constructed. Notice, the frames globally normal along Œ≥ are
generally not smooth on the sets of intersection of two or more neighborhoods U Œª.
If frames normal along Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM exist for a derivation D along vector
Ô¨Åelds, then, according to Corollary 3.4, these frames can be (locally) holonomic if
D is torsionless on Œ≥(Jn) in which case normal coordinates for it can exist.
Theorem 8.2. Let M be C3 manifold and Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM be injective, C1 and regular.
Let D be C1, linear along Œ≥ and torsionless derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds for
which (8.5) holds. Then for every s1 ‚ààJn there exists a subneighborhood Jn
1 ‚àãs1
of Jn and a chart (Uz, z) of M, with Uz ‚äÜU1 ((U1, x) is the above-constructed
chart, see (8.3)) and Uz ‚à©Œ≥(Jn) = Œ≥(Jn
1 ), which is normal for D along Œ≥|Jn
1 , i.e.,
on Œ≥(Jn
1 ). The coordinate functions zi : Uz ‚ÜíRdimR M of all such charts are given

t0 ‚ààRdimR M‚àín, s0 ‚ààJn

q = (A‚àí1(q))i

with respect to zi in a neighborhood Uz of an arbitrarily chosen point in Œ≥(Jn). In

168
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Subsection II.5.2 (see pp. 122‚Äì126) we solved this equation on arbitrary subman-
ifold N of M for A given by (II.5.11), the general solution being (II.5.16). Since
in the concluding part of the proof of Theorem 8.1 we proved that in the chart
(U1, x) the equality (II.5.11) reduces to (8.8) for N = Œ≥(Jn), t‚Ä≤
0 = t0, x(p) = (s, t),
p0 = x‚àí1(s, t0) = Œ≥(s), and ¬Øx(p0) = s, we can assert that the general form of the
looked for coordinates {zi} is (II.5.16) for the pointed special choice of the param-
eters in it. One can easily verify that, in the last case, equation (8.8) is simply an
equivalent form of (II.5.16).
‚ñ°
Theorem 8.2 gives a full constructive description of all local coordinates nor-
mal along an injective mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM for a torsionless derivation along
vector Ô¨Åelds. Hence it completes the exploration of the normal frames and coor-
dinates along such mappings.
8.2.
Locally injective mappings
Relying on the proof of Theorem II.3.2 on page 99, one can expect that the require-
ment the mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM to be injective, imposed in the previous subsection,
can be weakened. Indeed, this happens to be the case.
Call a mapping f : X ‚ÜíY , X and Y being sets, locally injective if for every
x ‚ààX there exists a subset Xx ‚äÜX with Xx ‚àãx such that the restricted mapping
f|Xx : Xx ‚ÜíY is injective. If X has some structure, e.g., if it is n-manifold, we
further admit that Xx possesses the same structure; e.g., Xx to be n-manifold too
in the particular example. For instance, the mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM, Jn being neigh-
borhood of Rn, is locally injective if for every s ‚ààJn there is a subneighborhood
In
s ‚äÜJn with In
s ‚àãs such that Œ≥|In
s : In
s ‚ÜíM is injective. Obviously, Œ≥ is locally
injective if the set Jn
I := {s|s ‚ààJn, Œ≥(s) is self-intersection point} ‚äÇJn has not
condensation points. The maximum neighborhood of s on which Œ≥ is injective will
be denoted by Jn
s . It can be represented as a union of all neighborhoods of s, like
In
s , on which Œ≥ is injective.
Proposition 8.1. Theorems 8.1 and 8.2 are valid if in them the condition on Œ≥ to
be injective is replaced with the requirement it to be locally injective and Jn
1 and
(U1, x) are constructed for the restricted mapping Œ≥|Jn
s0 instead for Œ≥.
Proof. Since Œ≥|Jn
s0 is injective, for it Theorems 8.1 and 8.2 hold. Consequently, they
are also valid for the whole mapping Œ≥ if the pointed changes are made in their
formulations, as in the considered version they concern only the local properties
of Œ≥ on subneighborhoods on which it is injective.
‚ñ°
Following the proof of Theorem II.3.2 and the lines after the proof of Corol-
lary II.5.2, we are going to prove the following theorem.
Theorem 8.3. Let M be C3 manifold endowed with C1 derivation D along vector
Ô¨Åelds and the mapping Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM be locally injective, C1, and regular. Suppose D
is linear along Œ≥ and its curvature satisÔ¨Åes (8.5). Then there exist frames globally

8. Frames normal along mappings
169
normal for D along the whole mapping Œ≥, i.e., normal on the whole set Œ≥(Jn).
Locally holonomic such frames exist iÔ¨ÄD is torsion free on Œ≥(Jn).
Proof. By Proposition 8.1 and the discussion after the proof of Corollary 8.1, for
every In ‚äÜJn for which Œ≥|In is injective there exist frames normal for D along
Œ≥|In. Let {In
Œª |Œª ‚ààŒõ} be an open cover of Jn such that the restricted mappings
Œ≥|In
Œª are injective.8 For each mapping Œ≥|Jn
Œª , Œª ‚ààŒõ, there exists a frame {EŒª
i }
globally normal for D, i.e., on Œ≥(Jn
Œª ) and all of them can be constructed in the
way pointed in the mentioned discussion. From the frames {EŒª
i }, Œª ‚ààŒõ, a frame
{Ei} globally normal along Œ≥ can be constructed: at every point p ‚ààŒ≥(Jn), we
put Ei|p = EŒª
i |p if there is a single Œª ‚ààŒõ for which p ‚ààŒ≥(In
Œª ), otherwise, if the
set {¬µ|¬µ ‚ààŒõ, Œ≥(In
¬µ) ‚àãp} consists of at least two elements, we arbitrary choose
some ¬µ0 ‚ààŒõ for which Œ≥(In
¬µ0) ‚àãp and deÔ¨Åne Ei|p = E¬µ0
i |p. The domain of {Ei} is
a union of the neighborhoods on which the frames {EŒª
i } forming it are deÔ¨Åned. It
is obvious that all frames globally normal along Œ≥ can be constructed by the just
describe method.
The last assertion of the theorem is a consequence of Proposition 3.4, Theo-
rem 8.2, and Proposition 8.1
‚ñ°
Notice, the proof of Theorem 8.3 provides a complete global description of
all frames normal along locally injective mappings, if such frames exist at all.
8.3.
Mappings between manifolds
Since the diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds are ‚Äòlocally Euclidean‚Äô (Subsection I.2.1), the
results obtained until now in the present section have natural generalization for
mappings like f : N ‚ÜíM, N being n-manifold. Below we brieÔ¨Çy sketch this
situation. Without loss of generality, N and M will be considered as real manifolds
(see p. 7).
Let f : N ‚ÜíM be C1 mapping from a C1 manifold N on a C3 manifold
M with dimR M ‚â•dimR N and D be C1 derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds of T 1(M).
We want to explore the problems of existence, uniqueness, construction, etc. of
frames (or, possibly, coordinates) normal for D along f. From the considerations
in Section 3, we know that D admits frames normal along f iÔ¨Äit is linear along
f, i.e., on f(N) ‚äÜM, and its coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices Œìk in a frame {Ei} deÔ¨Åned on
(a neighborhood of) f(N) satisfy the normal frame equation
Œìk(f(q))A(f(q)) + Ek(A)|f(q) = 0,
q ‚ààN
(8.11)
for some non-degenerate matrix-valued function A whose domain is the same as the
one of {Ei}. Moreover, all frames normal along f have the form {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej} where
A = [Aj
i ] is a non-degenerate solution of (8.11), if such exists. Hence the above

Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
range of problems (for a linear along f derivation) is reduced to the investigation
of the equation (8.11) in some frame {Ei}.
Locally (8.11) is equivalent to (8.2) for a suitable choice of the mapping
Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM, Jn being neighborhood in Rn for n = dimR N. To demonstrate this,
for arbitrary q0 ‚ààN, we take a chart (V, œï) of N with V ‚àãq0 and œï: V ‚ÜíJn for
some neighborhood Jn in Rn. Since œï is, by deÔ¨Ånition, homeomorphism, for every
q ‚ààV exists a unique s = (s1, . . . , sn) ‚ààJn such that s = œï(q) or q = œï‚àí1(s).
Therefore in (V, œï) equation (8.11) is equivalent to
Œìk(f(œï‚àí1(s)))A(f(œï‚àí1(s))) + Ek(A)|f(œï‚àí1(s)) = 0,
s ‚ààJn
(8.12)
which corresponds to (8.2) with
Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1.
(8.13)
Consequently in each chart (V, œï) of N the problems connected to the frames
normal along f : N ‚ÜíM are equivalent to the same problems for the frames
normal along the mapping Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 : Jn ‚ÜíM with Jn = œï(V ) ‚äÜRn and
n = dimR N. Moreover, the normal frames, if any, for the both mappings, f and
Œ≥, are identical. Since Œ≥ is (resp. locally) injective iÔ¨Äf is (resp. locally) injective (as
œï is bijection), the results in Subsection 8.1 and 8.2 have corresponding variants
concerning mappings between manifolds.
Theorem 8.4 (cf. Theorem 8.1). Let f : N ‚ÜíM be a mapping from a C1 manifold
N into a C3 manifold M, both considered as real manifolds, if some of them is/are
complex, with dimR N ‚â§dimR M, and D be C1 derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds of
T 1(M). Suppose f is locally injective, of class C1, and regular. Then:
(i) There exist frames normal along f for D if and only if D is linear along f,
i.e., on f(N), and it is locally curvature free on f(N) in a sense that for every
(dim N)-submanifold N ‚Ä≤ of N on which the restricted mapping f|N ‚Ä≤ : N ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí
M is injective, the derivation D is curvature free on f(N ‚Ä≤) as a manifold:
(RD(X, Y ))|q = 0,
Xq, Yq ‚ààTq(f(N ‚Ä≤)),
q ‚ààf(N ‚Ä≤).
(8.14)
For every chart (V, œï) of N ‚Ä≤, œï: V ‚ÜíJn ‚äÜR with n = dimR N, there
exists a chart (U1, x) of M with U1 ‚à©f(N ‚Ä≤) = f(V1), V1 = œï‚àí1(Jn
1 ) being
subneighborhood of V , such that in it (8.14) is equivalent to (8.6) with Œ≥ =
f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1.
(ii) If D admits frames normal along f, for every p1 ‚ààN, there exists a chart
(U1, x) of M, the same as in (i) above, with U1 ‚àãp1 and such that:
(a) The coordinates of every p ‚ààU1 in the associated coordinates {xi} are
x(p) = (s, t) for some s ‚ààJn
1 , where Jn
1 is a subneighborhood of Jn and
U1 ‚à©V = (f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1)(Jn
1 ) (for the notation, see (i)), and t ‚ààRdimR M‚àín,
and the coordinates of q ‚ààU1‚à©V are x(q) = (œï(q), t0) = (s, t0) for some
s ‚ààJn
1 and constant, independent of s, vector t0 = (tn+1

8. Frames normal along mappings

(b) All frames normal for D along f in U1, i.e., normal on U1 ‚à©V =
(f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1)(Jn
1 ), are

E‚Ä≤
i|p = Aj
i(p) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxj
		
p

, p = x‚àí1(s, t) ‚ààU1, where A
is given by (8.8) with Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1.
Remark 8.4. The formulation of the theorem implicitly uses the fact that f(N ‚Ä≤)
is n-dimensional, n = dimR N, real submanifold of M. (Recall, all manifolds are
considered as real ones in the present section.) This follows from the proved in
Subsection 8.1 assertion that Œ≥(Jn) is n-submanifold of M for regular C1 mapping
Œ≥ : Jn ‚ÜíM, Jn being neighborhood in Rn. In fact, since in every chart (V, œï),
œï: V ‚ÜíJn, of N we have f(V ) = (f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1)(Jn) and, consequently, f(N ‚Ä≤) is
n-submanifold of M as Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 is locally injective (œï is bijection), the image
f(N ‚Ä≤) is n-submanifold of M as it can be represented as a union of n-submanifolds
like f(V ).
Proof. The Ô¨Årst part of Assertion (i) is a trivial corollary of Theorem 7.1 (i) and the
fact that the frames globally normal along f can be constructed from the frames
normal along the restricted mappings f|N ‚Ä≤ in a way analogous to the one described
in the proof of Theorem 8.3 (with N for Jn and f for Œ≥). To prove the equivalence
of (8.14) and (8.6) for Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1, we notice that for every chart (V, œï) of N ‚Ä≤,
œï: V ‚ÜíJn ‚äÜRn, Theorem 8.1 (i) is valid for the mapping Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 : Jn ‚ÜíM.
So, equation (8.14) in (V, œï) is equivalent to (8.6) with Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 and there
is a chart (U1, x) of M, described in Subsection 8.1, in which (8.5) is equivalent
to (8.6) for Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 and U1 ‚à©Œ≥(Jn) = U1 ‚à©f(N ‚Ä≤) = (f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1)(Jn
1 ) = f(V1).
The proof of Assertion (ii) rests on Theorem 8.1 (ii). Let p1 ‚ààN and N ‚Ä≤
be (dim N)-submanifold of N with N ‚Ä≤ ‚àãp1 and such that f|N ‚Ä≤ is injective. Let
(V, œï), œï: V ‚ÜíJn ‚äÜRn, be a chart of N ‚Ä≤ and s1 = œï(p1) ‚ààJn. Now it is evident
that the second part of the theorem is a simple restatement of the second part of
Theorem 8.1 for the mapping Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 : Jn ‚ÜíM.
‚ñ°
Corollary 8.2 (cf. Corollary 8.1). Let the manifolds N and M, regarded as real
ones, if some of them is/are complex, be of classes C1 and C3, respectively, and
the mapping f : N ‚ÜíM be locally injective, of class C1, and regular. Let a deriva-
tion D along vector Ô¨Åelds of T 1(M) be of class C1 and linear along f and ‚àábe a
C1 linear connection on M coinciding on f(N) with D. For D exist frames normal
along f iÔ¨Äthere is a frame locally parallel on N with respect to ‚àáor iÔ¨Äthe par-
allel transport generated by ‚àáis locally path-independent on N along paths locally
lying entirely in N. Here by ‚Äòlocally‚Äô is understood on any (dim N)-dimensional
submanifold N ‚Ä≤ of N such that f|N ‚Ä≤ is injective.
Proof. See Corollary 8.1 for Œ≥ = f‚ó¶œï‚àí1, where œï is the coordinate homeomorphism
of a chart (V, œï) of N ‚Ä≤, and note that N can be covered by the domains of charts
like (V, œï).
‚ñ°
If the frames normal along a mapping f : N ‚ÜíM exist, the ones provided by
Theorem 8.4 (ii) are local in a sense that they are deÔ¨Åned only on some neighbor-
hood (in M) of every point in f(N). From these neighborhoods one can construct

172
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
a neighborhood of f(N) in M on which a frame globally normal along f can be
deÔ¨Åned by identifying it in each coordinate neighborhood with the corresponding
local normal frame; in a case of overlapping of two or more neighborhoods, one
arbitrary can Ô¨Åx some of the local frames to represent the global one. (For details,
see the paragraph after the proof of Corollary 8.1.) It is clear, all frames globally
normal along f can be constructed in this way.
If a derivation is torsionless, some of the frames normal for it, if any, are
holonomic and hence locally they are generated by (normal) local coordinates. Of
course, this is true for the frames normal along mappings between manifolds as
the following result states explicitly.
Theorem 8.5 (cf. Theorem 8.2). Let N and M be manifolds, considered as real ones
if some of them is/are complex, of classes C1 and C3, respectively, and f : N ‚ÜíM
be locally injective, C1, and regular. Let a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds of
T 1(M) be torsionless, of class C1, linear along f, and its curvature to satisÔ¨Åes
equation (8.14) on every (dim N)-dimensional submanifold N ‚Ä≤ of N on which f|N ‚Ä≤
is injective. Then for every point p1 ‚ààN there exist a chart (V1, œï) of N, with
œï: V1 ‚ÜíJn
1 ‚äÜRn, V1 ‚àãp1, n = dimR N and f|V1 injective, and a chart (Uz, z) of
M, with Uz ‚äÜU1 ((U1, x) is the chart provided by Theorem 8.4 (ii)) and Uz ‚à©N =
f(V1) = (f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1)(Jn
1 ), which is normal for D along f in f(V1), i.e., along f|V1
or on f(V1). The associated coordinates functions zi : Uz ‚ÜíRdimR M of all such
normal charts are given via equation (8.10) for Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1.
Proof. By Theorem 8.4 and Corollary 3.3, the derivation D admits normal co-
ordinates. Let p1 ‚ààN and (V, œï) and (U1, x) be the charts described in the
Theorem 8.4 with U1 ‚àãf(p1) ‚ààV . In the notation of Theorem 8.4, deÔ¨Åne
V1 = U1 ‚à©V = (f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1)(Jn
1 ) and Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1 : Jn
1 ‚ÜíM. Now the rest of the proof
follows from the remark that Theorem 8.2 is valid for the mapping Œ≥ = f ‚ó¶œï‚àí1. ‚ñ°

Normal frames and coordinates for derivations
along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
In Sections 3‚Äì8, we have explored problems connected with frames normal for
derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds of the tensor algebra over a manifold (see DeÔ¨Åni-
tion 2.3). In the present section, we want brieÔ¨Çy to pay attention to the same
range of problems for derivations along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld or, equivalently, for a
given derivation of the same algebra (see DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1).
Throughout this section X will denote a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld over a manifold M,
X ‚ààX(M). Respectively, DX means a derivation along this concrete X of T 1(M)
or, in other words, DX is a derivation of T 1(M) with decomposition like (2.3)
with Ô¨Åxed X and arbitrary S.
DeÔ¨Ånition 9.1 (cf. DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1). Let U be a subset of a manifold M and DX be
a derivation along some Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X ‚ààX(M) of T 1(M). A frame {Ei},

9. Derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
173
deÔ¨Åned on an open subset of M containing U or equal to it, is called normal on
U for DX if the components of DX in {Ei} vanish on U (for the Ô¨Åxed X).
Proposition 9.1. The only derivation D0 along the zero vector Ô¨Åeld for which
frames normal on U ‚äÜM exist is the zero derivation, assigning to a C1 tensor
Ô¨Åeld the zero tensor Ô¨Åeld of the same type. Every frame deÔ¨Åned on (a neighborhood
of ) U is normal for D0 on its domain.
Proof. If D0 admits a frame {Ei} normal on U, Œì0
i
j|U = 0, equation (2.5) implies
D0K = 0 for every tensor Ô¨Åeld K, so D0 is the zero derivation, with decomposi-
tion (2.3) with X = 0 and S0 = 0. If D0 is the zero derivation, from (2.6) follows
that every frames {Ei} is normal for it.
‚ñ°
Proposition 9.1 has a slightly more general local version:
Proposition 9.2. Let M be manifold, U ‚äÜM, X ‚ààX(M), X|U = 0, and DX be
derivation along X. Frames normal on U for DX exist if and only if DX is the
zero derivation on U, DX
		
T 1(U) = D0|T 1(U), assigning to every tensor Ô¨Åeld on U
the zero tensor Ô¨Åeld of the same type on U. If on U the derivation DX is the zero
one, then every frame deÔ¨Åned on U or on a larger set is normal for DX on U.
Proof. If {Ei} is a frame normal for DX on U, i.e., ŒìX|U = 0, from (2.5) we get
(DXK)|U = 0 for every tensor Ô¨Åeld K as X|U = 0. Conversely, if DX is the zero
derivation on U, from (2.6), we derive ŒìX|U = 0 in every frame {Ei}.
‚ñ°
Nevertheless the above two results are completely trivial, they give a full
description of the frames, if any, normal for derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds on the
sets on which these vector Ô¨Åelds vanish.1 For this reason, further in this section
we assume X to be a non-zero vector Ô¨Åeld on U, X|U Ã∏= 0, but there could exist
points in U at which X vanishes. Notice, from (2.6) follows that if DX is the
zero derivation along X on U ‚äÜM, then its components vanish identically in any
frame deÔ¨Åned on U. Combining this with (2.11), we get X|U = 0 . Hence, the zero
derivation on U along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld can be such if this vector Ô¨Åeld vanished
on U. So, assuming X|U Ã∏= 0, we automatically exclude the case when DX is the
zero derivation on U from further considerations.
One may call a derivation DX along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X linear on U ‚äÜM
if in some (and hence in any) frame its components‚Äô matrix has the form ŒìX(p) =
Œìk(p)Xk(p), p ‚ààU, for some matrix-valued functions Œìk on U. Since the compo-
nents‚Äô matrix of every DX for every Ô¨Åxed X possess (generally inÔ¨Ånitely many)
such representations,2 this concept is useless for exploring the normal frames for
DX. Paraphrasing, we may say that every derivation along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld is
linear on every set.
1Evidently, if DX is the zero derivation on U and {Ei} is a frame deÔ¨Åned on V with V ‚à©U Ã∏= ‚àÖ,
the frame {Ei} is normal on V ‚à©U for DX. Consequently, every chart or coordinate system is
normal for the zero derivation on the intersection of their domains.
2For example, if X1(p) Ã∏= 0, we put Œì1(p) = ŒìX(p)/X1(p) and Œìk(p) = 0 for k ‚â•2.

174
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Let {Ei} be a frame deÔ¨Åned on a (neighborhood of) U ‚äÜM. A frame {E‚Ä≤
i =
Aj
iEi}, where A = [Aj
i] is a C1 non-degenerate matrix valued-function, is normal
for DX on U iÔ¨ÄA is a solution of the normal frame equation (see (2.11), cf. (3.3))
(ŒìXA + X(A))|U = 0
for Ô¨Åxed X ‚ààX(M).
(9.1)
So, DX admits frames normal on U iÔ¨Äthis equation (for Ô¨Åxed X) has solutions;
if they exist, all such frames are {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej} with A being a solution of (9.1).
Below we shall prove that equation (9.1) (for Ô¨Åxed X) always has (non-degenerate)
solutions (in a neighborhood of the non-singular points of X) which results in the
general conclusion that frames normal for a derivation along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
exist on arbitrary subsets of M, in particular on the whole manifold M. The set of
frames normal for a derivation along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld is described by the following
result.
Proposition 9.3. Let DX be derivation along some Ô¨Åxed X ‚ààX(M) and U ‚äÜM.
The frames normal on U for DX (if any) are connected by linear transformations
whose matrices vanish under the action of X on U. Equivalently, the set of all
frames normal for DX (if any) consists of frames that can be obtained from a Ô¨Åxed
normal frame for DX by transformations of the described type.
Proof. If {Ei} and {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} are normal for DX on U, then ŒìX = Œì‚Ä≤
X = 0,
so (9.1) (or (2.11)) implies X(A)|U = 0, A = [Aj
i].
‚ñ°
Since the concepts of curvature and torsion can not be introduced for deriva-
tions along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åelds,3 for them there are no analogues of Proposition 3.3
and Corollary 3.3. Regardless of that, they always admit normal coordinates (in
a neighborhood of the non-singular points of X) which are deÔ¨Åned as follows.
DeÔ¨Ånition 9.2 (cf. DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2). A chart (V, x) of M and the associated to it
coordinate functions or system are called normal on U ‚äÜV for a derivation DX
along Ô¨Åxed X ‚ààX(M) if the coordinate frame

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

is normal for DX on U.
If U ‚äÜM and (V, x) is a chart of M such that V ‚à©U Ã∏= ‚àÖ, the coordinates
x‚Ä≤i = x‚Ä≤i(x1, . . . , xdim M) are normal on U ‚à©V iÔ¨Ä(9.1) holds for Aj

This equation is more suitable than (9.2) for Ô¨Ånding x‚Ä≤ i if xi are known.
Now we turn our attention to the problems of existence and construction of
normal frames and coordinates for derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åelds. Formally
they are equivalent to the solutions of equations (9.1) and (9.2), respectively, under
certain conditions.
9.1.
The case at a single point
Let p0 ‚ààM be a given point in a manifold M and DX be a derivation along some
Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X ‚ààX(U) of T 1(M) with components‚Äô matrix ŒìX in a frame
{Ei} deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood of p0. The frames normal for DX at p0, if any, are
{E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj}, where A = [Aj
i ] is a non-degenerate solution of (9.1) for U = {p0}:
ŒìX(p0)A(p0) + (X(A))|p0 = 0.
(9.3)
Theorem 9.1. Let M be C1 manifold, p0 ‚ààM and DX be a derivation along Ô¨Åxed
X ‚ààX(M). If Xp0 = 0, then either every frame in a neighborhood of p0 is normal
at p0 for DX (if DX is the zero derivation at p0) or such frames do not exist (if DX
is not the zero derivation at p0). If Xp0 Ã∏= 0, then DX always admits frames {E‚Ä≤
i}
normal at p0 and, if X is continuous, all such frames are

E‚Ä≤
i|p = Aj
i(p)Ej|p

,
where A: U1 ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K) is given by equation (9.8) below and p ‚ààU1, with
(U1, x) being the special chart constricted in Subsection II.3.2 for U1 ‚àãp0 and Œ≥
being the integral path for X through p0.4
Proof. If Xp0 = 0, then equation (9.3) has solution(s) with respect to A iÔ¨Ä
ŒìX(p0) = 0 in which case DX is the zero derivation at p and every non-generate
matrix-valued function A is its solution. This trivial conclusion, which follows also
from Proposition 9.2 for U = {p}, means that for Xp0 = 0 either every frame in
a neighborhood of p0 is normal for DX at p0 or frames normal for DX at p0 do
not exist. To check the case, one should take some frame and calculate the matrix
of the components of DX in it. If it happens to be non-vanishing at p0, frames
normal at p0 do not exist, otherwise every frame is normal for DX at p0.
Suppose now Xp0 Ã∏= 0. Since (9.3) implies a single condition at p0 on A and
its directional derivative along X, one can expect that it admits inÔ¨Ånitely many
solutions which will be proved below.
4Equivalently, in an arbitrary chart (U, y) with U ‚àãp0, the matrix-valued function A has the
form (9.4) under the condition (9.5). Formula (9.7) provides a class of such A which is its general
form iÔ¨Ädet(ŒìX(p0)) Ã∏= 0.

176
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Let (U, y) be a chart of M with U ‚àãp0, Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇyi , and A: U ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K)
be of class C2. In U is valid the Taylor expansion
A(p) = A0 + Ak[yk(p) ‚àíyk(p0)] + Akl(p)[yk(p) ‚àíyk(p0)][yl(p) ‚àíyl(p0)]
(9.4)
where A0 ‚ààGL(dim M, K), Ak are constant matrices and the matrix-valued func-
tions Akl on U are of class C1 and they and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are
bounded at p0. Inserting (9.4) into (9.3), we get
ŒìX(p0)A0 + Xi
y(p0)Ai = 0,
det A0 Ã∏= 0
(9.5)
with Xi
y being the components of X in

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇyi

.
A simple veriÔ¨Åcation shows that
A0 = Xi
y(p0)Bi,
Ak = ‚àíŒìX(p0)Bk,
(9.6)
with arbitrary constant matrices B1, . . . , Bdim M for which det(Xi
y(p0)Bi) Ã∏= 0, is
a solution of (9.5) to which corresponds a solution of (9.3) of the form5
A(p) = Xi
y(p0)Bi ‚àíŒìX(p0)Bk[yk(p) ‚àíyk(p0)]
+ Akl(p)[yk(p) ‚àíyk(p0)][yl(p) ‚àíyl(p0)].
(9.7)
If ŒìX(p0) is non-degenerate, then, evidently, (9.6) is the general solution of (9.5)
and, consequently, (9.7) is the general solution of (9.3). A method for obtaining the
general solution of (9.5), and hence of (9.3), for arbitrary ŒìX(p0) and continuous
X is the following one.6
Suppose X is of class C0. Since Xp0 Ã∏= 0, there is a unique integral path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM through p0, i.e., (see equation (I.2.19) on page 13) ÀôŒ≥(s) = XŒ≥(s),
s ‚ààJ, and Œ≥(s0) = p0 for some Ô¨Åxed s0 ‚ààJ. In Subsection II.3.2, we saw that
there is a chart (U1, x) with p0 ‚ààU1 ‚äÜU and coordinates functions (II.3.12)
in which the coordinates of Œ≥(s) are given via (II.3.13). Therefore in (U1, x) we
have Xk
Œ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥k(s) = Œ¥k
1 for s ‚ààJ1, where J1 ‚äÜJ is such that J1 ‚àãs0 and
Œ≥(J1) = Œ≥(J) ‚à©U1. Hence
XŒ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥(s) =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx1
			
Œ≥(s),
and, in particular, Xp0 =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx1
		
p0.
Repeating the aforesaid with (U1.x) for (U, y), we get
ŒìX(p0)A(x)
0
+ A(x)
1
= 0
(9.5‚Ä≤)
5This solution was Ô¨Årst derived in [84, Section IV].
6If X is not of class C0 in a neighborhood of p0 and det(ŒìX(p0)) = 0, the methods of matrix
algebra should be used for explicit solving of (9.5). Equivalently, one can take any C1 vector
Ô¨Åeld Y with Yp0 = Xp0 and ŒìY (p0) = ŒìX(p0) for X in the next lines.

their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded at p0.

The problem for existence and description of charts (or coordinates) normal
at a single point p0 can be attacked by two independent but equivalent ways.
The Ô¨Årst one is to select the free parameters in (9.8) so that there to exist local
coordinates {zi} with
‚àÇ

‚àÇxj . The second one, which we will
developed below, is to solve directly the normal frame equation (9.2‚Ä≤) for U = {p0},
i.e.,

, and {zi} are the looked for normal
coordinates, if any.
Theorem 9.2. Let M be a C3 manifold, p0 ‚ààM and DX be some derivation
along Ô¨Åxed X ‚ààX(M). If p0 is a singular point for X, i.e., Xp0 = 0, then either
every chart with p0 in its domain is normal for DX (in a case DX is the zero
derivation at p0) or charts normal at p0 for DX do not exist (in a case DX is not
the zero derivation at p0). If Xp0 Ã∏= 0, then for DX always exist charts (Uz, z), with
Uz ‚àãp0, normal at p0 and the general form of their coordinate functions zi is given
via equation (9.13) below in which: ai, ai

jkl : Uz ‚à©V ‚ÜíK
are of class C1 and they and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded at p0,
(U1, x), with U1 ‚äáUz, is the special chart constructed above in this subsection,
and ŒìX is the matrix of DX in

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

.
Proof. If Xp0 = 0, then (9.9) holds iÔ¨ÄŒìX(p0) = 0 (see also (9.2) for U ‚à©V = {p0}).
Hence if Xp0 = 0, then charts normal at p0 either do not exist or every chart with
p0 in its domain is normal. (Recall, in the last case DX must be the zero derivation
at p0; see Proposition 9.2.)
Let M be C3 manifold, p0 ‚ààM, Xp0 Ã∏= 0, and (U, y) be a given chart in M
with U ‚àãp0. We search for a chart (Uz, z) with Uz ‚àãp0 which is normal at p0 for

The case along paths
The Ô¨Årst step for generalizing the results form the previous subsection is to in-
vestigate the problems concerning frames or coordinates normal along paths for
derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld.

9. Derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
179
In this section, as in Sections II.3, 5 and 8, we shall look on the manifold M
as on a real one, i.e., if M is real, no changes are necessary and, if M is complex,
we consider it as a real manifold of dimension dimR M = 2 dim M ‚â°2 dimC M
(see p. 7). We shall formally reÔ¨Çected this in writing dimR M instead of dim M.
Respectively, the Latin indices with not explicitly speciÔ¨Åed range will run from 1
to dimR M and the ranges of the coordinate homeomorphisms will lie in RdimR M.
Suppose Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a locally injective C1 regular path in a C2 manifold
M endowed with C0 derivation DX along a Ô¨Åxed non-zero vector Ô¨Åeld X of class
C0, i.e., X ‚ààX0(M) with X Ã∏= 0. The problem is to study the equation (9.1) for
U = Œ≥(J), i.e.,
ŒìX(Œ≥(s))A(Œ≥(s)) + X(A)|Œ≥(s) = 0
(9.14)
for s ‚ààJ. The idea for investigating (9.14) is to be constructed a chart along Œ≥ such
that the Ô¨Årst (or the Ô¨Årst two) coordinate(s) of a point in its domain to be equal
to some value of the parameter of Œ≥ (or to it and a function of the parameter of
an integral path of X) and in which X coincides with or is proportional to certain
basic coordinate vector.
Theorem 9.3. Let M be C3 manifold (which should be considered as a real one of
dimension dimR M if it is complex), Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be locally injective C1 and regular,
s0 ‚ààJ, and DX be a C1 derivation along a Ô¨Åxed C0 vector Ô¨Åeld X on M. If Œ≥(s0)
is a singular point for X, X|Œ≥(s0) = 0, then either every frame in a neighborhood
of Œ≥(s0) is normal at Œ≥(s0) for DX (in which case DX is the zero derivation at
Œ≥(s0)) or such frames do not exist (in which case DX is not the zero derivation
at Œ≥(s0)). If Œ≥(s0) is not a singular point for X, X|Œ≥(s0) Ã∏= 0, then there exist a
subinterval J1 ‚àãs0 of J and a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} such that {E‚Ä≤
i} is normal for DX along
Œ≥|J1, i.e., on Œ≥(J1). Moreover, there is a neighborhood V1 of Œ≥(J1) on which all
frames normal for DX are

E‚Ä≤
i = Aj

‚àÇ
‚àÇxj

, where A = [Aj
i]: V1 ‚ÜíGL(dimR M, R),
V1 ‚äÜU1, and (U1, x) is a chart of M with associated coordinates {xi}. The chart
(U1, x), transformation matrix A, and neighborhood V1 are constructed in diÔ¨Äerent
ways depending on is the condition (9.15) below (with J0 ‚äáJ1) valid or not:
(a) If (9.15) holds, (U1, x) is the special chart described in Subsection II.3.2 for
the path Œ≥|J1, A is given by equation (9.19) below, and V1 = x‚àí1(J1, W) where
W is a neighborhood of t0 in RdimR M‚àí1 on which A0 is non-degenerate;
(b) If (9.15) is not valid, (U1, x) is the special chart constructed at the begin-
ning of Subsection 8.1 for the mapping Œ±, introduced below on page 181 in
the proof of this theorem, A is given by equation (9.22) below, and V1 =
x‚àí1(J1, J‚Ä≤
0, RdimR M‚àí2) where J‚Ä≤
0 is such that A|Œ≥(J‚Ä≤
0) is non-degenerate.
Proof. If X|Œ≥(s) = 0 for some s ‚ààJ, then (9.14) implies ŒìX(Œ≥(s)) = 0 as A is
non-degenerate (cf. a similar situation explored in Subsection 9.1). Hence at the
singular points of X along Œ≥, if any, either every frame is normal (DX is the zero
derivation at them) or frames normal at them do not exist (DX is not the zero
derivation at them). In particular, if X is singular along Œ≥, X|Œ≥(J) = 0, then either
every frame along Œ≥ is normal for DX or such frames do not exist at all.

180
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Below we shall suppose the existence of s0 ‚ààJ such that XŒ≥(s0) Ã∏= 0, i.e.,
that X is not singular along the whole path Œ≥. Since X is of class C0, there is a
neighborhood U0 of Œ≥(s0) in which X is non-singular, X|U0 Ã∏= 0.
Let Œ≤p : J‚Ä≤
p ‚ÜíM, p ‚ààŒ≥(J) be the integral path of X through p (see p. 13),
i.e., Œ≤p(œÉp,0) = p ‚ààŒ≥(J) for some œÉp,0 ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
p and ÀôŒ≤p(œÉp) = XŒ≤p(œÉp), œÉp ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
p.
For the path Œ≤Œ≥(s0) (in a neighborhood of Œ≥(s0)) there are two possibilities: it
(locally) intersects Œ≥ only at Œ≥(s0) = Œ≤Œ≥(s0)(œÉŒ≥(s0),0) for Ô¨Åxed œÉŒ≥(s0),0 ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
Œ≥(s0) or it
is (locally) obtainable from Œ≥ by a possible change of its parameter. We shall write
that in terms of X. The second possibility means the existence of a subinterval J0
of J with J0 ‚àãs0 and function g: Œ≥(J0) ‚ÜíR\{0} such that Œ≥(J0) ‚äÇU0, Œ≥|J0 is
injective (recall that Œ≥ is supposed locally injective), and on Œ≥(J0) the Ô¨Åeld X is
proportional to the vector Ô¨Åeld ÀôŒ≥ tangent to Œ≥ with factor g,
X|Œ≥(J0) = g ÀôŒ≥,
(9.15)
while the Ô¨Årst possibility is equivalent to the nonexistence of such connection
between X and ÀôŒ≥. (Notice, (9.15) with g = 1 means that Œ≥ is, possibly locally, an
integral path for X.)
Let the relation (9.15) hold. Then, by virtue of equation (I.2.3), we have
X(A)|Œ≥(s) = g(Œ≥(s))[ÀôŒ≥(s)(A)] = g(Œ≥(s)) dA(Œ≥(s))
ds
, so (9.14) reduces to
dA(Œ≥(s))

g(Œ≥(s))ŒìX(Œ≥(s))A(Œ≥(s)) = 0,

only on Œ≥(J0), is

Y |s=s0 = 1.
(9.18)
If dimR M = 1, which is possible only if M is real, then (9.15) always holds8
and (9.17) gives the general solution of (9.14) with respect to A in Œ≥(J0) ‚àãŒ≥(s0).9
For dimR M ‚â•2, the general form of A on some neighborhood of Œ≥(s0) could
be found as follows. Since the integral paths are without self-intersections, i.e.,
8For dimR M = 1, the vector ÀôŒ≥(s) Ã∏= 0, s ‚ààJ0, can be taken as a basis of the one-dimensional
tangent space TŒ≥(s)(M), respectively {ÀôŒ≥} is a frame on Œ≥(J0). Therefore (9.15) is simply the
expansion of X over {ÀôŒ≥} in this case.

injective [9, 11], such is the restricted path Œ≥|J0. Construct for Œ≥|J0 the special
chart (U1, x) described in Subsection II.3.2 (see p. 94 with Œ≥|J0 : J0 ‚ÜíM for Œ≥).
Then, for p ‚ààU1, we have x(p) = (s, t) for some s ‚ààJ1 ‚äÜJ0 (recall that Œ≥(J1) =
U1 ‚à©Œ≥(J0)) and t ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1 and x(Œ≥(s)) = (s, t0) for a Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1.

A2, . . . , AdimR M on U1 are of class C1 and they and their Ô¨Årst derivatives are
bounded when t ‚Üít0, i.e., on Œ≥(J1). Since A is continuous (it is supposed of
class C1), there is a neighborhood of t0 in RdimR M‚àí1 in which A(x‚àí1(s, t)) is
non-degenerate.
Let us now suppose dimR M ‚â•2 and the integral path Œ≤Œ≥(s0) : J‚Ä≤
Œ≥(s0) ‚ÜíM
to intersect Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM at the single point Œ≥(s0) = Œ≤Œ≥(s0)(œÉŒ≥(s0),0) for some unique
œÉŒ≥(s0),0 ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
Œ≥(s0).10 Since Œ≥ is locally injective, there is a subinterval J3 ‚äÜJ with
J3 ‚àãs0 such that Œ≥|J3 : J3 ‚ÜíM is without self-intersections. Let J2 := {s|s ‚àà
J3, Œ≥(s) ‚ààU0}. Then Œ≥|J2 is injective path and along it X does not vanish. At
last, since X and Œ≥ are continuous, there exists a subinterval J0 ‚äÜJ2 with J0 ‚àãs0
such that the integral path Œ≤Œ≥(s), s ‚ààJ2, intersects Œ≥|J0 only once (at the point
Œ≥(s) = Œ≤Œ≥(s)(œÉŒ≥(s),0)). A ‚Äòlocal‚Äô solution of (9.14) for the restricted path Œ≥|J0 can
be found as follows.
Let, for every p ‚ààŒ≥(J), there be Ô¨Åxed (chosen) some C1 bijective mapping
(C1 diÔ¨Äeomorphism) œÑp : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíJ‚Ä≤
p from some open R-interval J‚Ä≤ to the domain
of the integral path Œ≤p such that œÑp(œÉ0) = œÉp,0 for Ô¨Åxed œÉ0 ‚ààJ‚Ä≤.11 Consider a
mapping Œ±: J0 √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM with Œ±(s, œÉ) := Œ≤Œ≥(s)(œÑŒ≥(s)(œÉ)) for (s, œÉ) ‚ààJ0 √ó J‚Ä≤.
Due to the aforesaid, Œ± is injective, of class C1 and regular. Consequently, for
it are applicable the results at the beginning of Subsection 8.1 with Œ±, 2, and
J0 √ó J‚Ä≤ for Œ≥, n, and Jn respectively. Therefore for Œ± can be constructed a chart
(U1, x), explicitly given by (8.3) for n = 2, Œ≥ = Œ±, and J2
1 ‚äÜJ2 = J0 √ó J‚Ä≤,
with U1 ‚àãŒ±(s0, œÉ0) = Œ≥(s0) and U1 ‚äÜU0, such that there is a subneighborhood

1 ) = U1 ‚à©Œ≥(J2), the coordinates of p ‚ààU1 are
10This is only a local property if (9.15) does not hold. But in this way we do not loose generality
since if œÉ‚àí‚â§œÉŒ≥(s0),0 and œÉ+ ‚â•œÉŒ≥(s0),0 are respectively the maximal and minimal elements of
the set {œÉ|œÉ ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
Œ≥(s0), Œ≤Œ≥(s0)(œÉŒ≥(s0)) = Œ≥(s) for some s ‚ààJ} ‚àãœÉŒ≥(s0),0 and œÉ‚àíÃ∏= œÉ+, then we
can take the interval (œÉ‚àí, œÉ+) ‚àãœÉŒ≥(s0),0 for J‚Ä≤
Œ≥(s0).
11Since all open real intervals are (C‚àû-) diÔ¨Äeomorphic, mappings like œÑp always exist.

Since in the special chart (U1, x) we have

on Œ≥(J1), i.e., when œÉ ‚ÜíœÉ0 and t ‚Üít0. Since we have det A(x‚àí1(s, œÉ0, t)) =
det A0(x‚àí1(s, œÉ0, t)) Ã∏= 0, ‚àûand A is continuous (as it is of class C1), there

The Theorem 9.3 provides a complete local description of the frames normal
along a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM for a derivation DX along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X ‚ààX(M)
at the points in which X does not vanish. In particular, if XŒ≥(J) Ã∏= 0, then every
point along Œ≥ has a neighborhood on which frames normal along Œ≥ exist and from
these frames all frames globally normal along Œ≥ can be constructed.
In a neighborhood of every point Œ≥(s0), s0 ‚ààJ, for which XŒ≥(s0) Ã∏= 0 coor-
dinates {zi} normal along Œ≥ exist. They can be found by integrating the system

9. Derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
183
Proposition 9.4. Let M be C3 manifold, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be locally injective, C1 and
regular path, and DX be C1 derivation along a Ô¨Åxed X ‚ààX0(M). For every s0 ‚ààJ
for which X|Œ≥(s0) Ã∏= 0, there exist local coordinates in a neighborhood of Œ≥(s0) which
are normal along Œ≥. Their general form is given by equation (9.24) below under
the conditions (9.26) (resp. (9.27)) below if (9.15) holds (resp. does not hold).
Proof. Let s0 ‚ààJ, XŒ≥(s0) Ã∏= 0, and (U1, x) with U1 ‚àãŒ≥(s0) be the special chart
constructed above with reference mapping Œ≥|J0 or Œ± if (9.15) holds or not, respec-
tively. We shall look for a chart (Uz, z) with Œ≥(s0) ‚ààUz ‚äÜU1 in which (9.23) is
valid. Since M is supposed of class C3, we can write the expansion
zi(p) = ai(p0)+ai
j(p0)[xj(p)‚àíxj(p0)]+ai
jk(p)[xj(p)‚àíxj(p0)][xk(p)‚àíxk(p0)].
(9.24)
Here: p ‚ààUz, p0 is the ‚Äòprojection‚Äô of p along Œ≥ or Œ± (i.e., p0 = x‚àí1(s, t0) =
Œ≥(s) or p0 = x‚àí1(s, œÉ, t0) = Œ≤Œ≥(s)(œÑŒ≥(s)(œÉ)) if p = x‚àí1(s, t) or p = x‚àí1(s, œÉ, t)
respectively), ai and ai
j are C1 functions of p0 and ai
jk : Uz ‚ÜíR are C1 and they
and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded when p ‚Üíp0.
In the chart (U1, x), the Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X has the expansion X|Œ≥(s) =
g(Œ≥(s)) ‚àÇ
‚àÇx1
		
Œ≥(s) or (9.20) if (9.15) holds or not, respectively. So, in these two cases,

We are not going to solve these systems of diÔ¨Äerential equations, but we must
note that they always have solutions according to the general theorems of the
theory of diÔ¨Äerential equations [34]. The substitution of these solutions into (9.24)
gives the corresponding coordinates normal along the path Œ≥. The domain Uz of
the normal chart (Uz, z) should be chosen such that in it the Jacobian det
 ‚àÇzi

be non-vanishing.

Problem 9.1. Explore the system (9.26)‚Äì(9.27) of diÔ¨Äerential equations and Ô¨Ånd
its general solution.
9.3.
The case on the whole manifold
The purpose of this section is to be shown that frames normal for a derivation
along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld exist on the whole manifold. The general form of these
frames will be found too.
Let M be C1 manifold, X ‚ààX0(M), X Ã∏= 0, {Ei} be a frame on M, and DX
be a C0 derivation along X. As we know, a frame {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i Ej} is normal for DX
(on M) iÔ¨Ä(9.1) holds for U = M,
ŒìXA + X(A) = 0
(9.28)
where ŒìX is the matrix of DX in {Ei}. We intend to demonstrate that this equa-
tion always has (local) non-degenerate solutions (at the non-singular points for
X) in contrast to the similar (system of) equation(s) for linear connections (Sec-
tion II.4) or for derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds (Section 6).

9. Derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
185
Theorem 9.4. Let M be C1 manifold, X be continuous vector Ô¨Åeld on M, X be
not identically zero on M, and DX be a C0 derivation along X. For every p0 ‚ààM
for which Xp0 Ã∏= 0, there exists a chart (U, x) with associated coordinate system
{xi} such that: U ‚àãp0, X|U =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx1
		
U, there exist frames normal on U for DX
and all such frames are

E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
i
‚àÇ
‚àÇxj

where A = [Aj
i]: U ‚ÜíGL(dim M, R)
is given by equation (9.31) below in which Y is deÔ¨Åned by (9.32) below and A0
is a non-degenerate matrix-valued function. If p0 ‚ààM and Xp0 = 0, at p0 exist
frames normal for DX iÔ¨ÄDX is the zero derivation at p0, (DXK)|p0 = 0 for every
tensor Ô¨Åeld K, in which case every frame (in a neighborhood of p0) is normal at
p0 for DX.
Proof. Let us choose some p0 ‚ààM such that Xp0 Ã∏= 0. According to [7, Proposi-
tion 1.53], there is a chart (U, x) of M with U ‚àãp0 and local coordinates {xi} for
which12
X|U =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx1
			
U Ã∏= 0.
(9.29)
So, in (U, x) the normal frame equation (9.28) (on U) with Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi reads
‚àÇA
‚àÇx1
			
p = ‚àíŒìX(p)A(p).
(9.30)
Its general solution on U is
A(p) = Y

x1(p), x1(p0); ‚àíŒìX(x‚àí1( ¬∑ , x2(p), . . . , xdim M(p)))

√ó A0

x2(p), . . . , xdim M(p)

,
(9.31)
where p ‚ààU, the matrix-valued function Y = Y (x1(p), x1(p0); Z), with continuous
matrix-valued function Z on x1(U), is the unique solution of the initial-value
problem (see Lemma II.3.2 on page 96 or Lemma II.4.1 on page 105)
‚àÇY
‚àÇx1
			
p = ZY,
Y |x1(p)=x1(p0) = 1
(9.32)
and A0 is non-degenerate matrix-valued function of its arguments.
This ends the proof of the Ô¨Årst part of the theorem. The second one is a
consequence of Proposition 9.2 (for U = {p0}).
‚ñ°
The Theorem 9.4 gives a complete local description of all frames normal on
M. If X is non-zero everywhere on M or if DX is the zero derivation at the points
at which X vanishes, all frames globally normal on the whole manifold M for DX
can be constructed from the local normal frames provided by Theorem 9.4. For
this end, a method similar to the one described in Subsection II.5.2 should be
applied (see page 123).
12This is a special case of the theorem for straightening (of integral paths); see [91, p. 121].

186
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
If (U, x) is the chart provided by Theorem 9.4, the coordinate functions zi
of every normal chart (V, z) with p ‚ààV ‚äÜU are solutions of (9.2‚Ä≤) with x‚Ä≤ i = zi

According to the theorems of the theory of (linear partial) diÔ¨Äerential equa-
tions [34], this equation always has (local) solutions with respect to zi. The general
solution of (9.33) can not be expressed in a closed form for arbitrary ŒìX. But if
M and DX are of class C‚àû, it can be found by expanding zi = zi(x1, . . . , xdim M)
and ŒìX

where the a‚Äôs and Œ≥‚Äôs are constant numbers symmetric in i1 . . . in and det[aj

Indeed, substituting these expansions into (9.33), we get the following inÔ¨Ånite

(9.35)
From these equalities and (9.34a), the general solution of (9.33) can be found.
Since ‚àÇzi
‚àÇxj = ai
j and [ai
j] is non-degenerate, the obtained series for zi is convergent
in some neighborhood V ‚äÜU of p0 and the change {xi} ‚Üí{zi} is well-deÔ¨Åned in
V , i.e., it is with non-zero Jacobian in V . In this way all charts (V, z) normal for
the initial derivation DX can be found in a neighborhood of every point p0 ‚ààM
at which Xp0 Ã∏= 0. (Recall, if Xp0 = 0 and DX is the zero derivation at p0, then
every chart in a neighborhood of p0 is normal at p0 for DX, but if Xp0 = 0 and
DX is not the zero derivation at p0, then charts (and frames) normal at p0 for DX
do not exist.)
9.4.
Other cases
Following the methods of Subsections 9.1‚Äì9.3 and the ideas of Sections 4‚Äì8, one can
try to attack the problems for existence and construction of frames and coordinates
normal on submanifolds or along (locally injective) mappings for derivations along
Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld. The main obstacles on this way are the complicated systems
of partial diÔ¨Äerential equations one gets, a typical example of which are (9.26)

9. Derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
187
and (9.27).13 For this reason, we are not going to study these situations here and
want only to make some comments on them.
Proposition 9.5. Let M be C1 manifold, U be any subset of M, X be continuous
vector Ô¨Åeld on M, and DX be derivation along X. If p ‚ààU and Xp Ã∏= 0, then there
is a subset Up of U containing p on which frames normal for DX exist. If p ‚ààU
and Xp = 0, then at p exist frames normal for DX iÔ¨ÄDX is the zero derivation
at p and if this is the case, every frame deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood of p is normal
at p for DX.
Proof. If p ‚ààU ‚äÇM and Xp Ã∏= 0, by Theorem 9.4 exist frames normal on some
neighborhood U0 of p in M (and all of them are described by this theorem). If
{Ei} is such a frame, then, obviously, it is normal for DX on Up := U0 ‚à©U ‚àãp as
Up ‚äÜU, which completes the proof of the Ô¨Årst part of the theorem. The second
part of its assertion is a consequence of Proposition 9.2.
‚ñ°
Corollary 9.1. If N is a submanifold of a C1 manifold M, X ‚ààX0(M), X Ã∏= 0,
and DX is a derivation along X, then for every p ‚ààN for which Xp Ã∏= 0 exists a
neighborhood U N
p
of p in N on which frames normal for DX exist.
Proof. See Proposition 9.5 or its proof for U = N and put U N
p = Up.
‚ñ°
Corollary 9.2. Let f : N ‚ÜíM be locally injective mapping between C1 manifolds N
and M, X ‚ààX0(M), X Ã∏= 0, and DX be derivation along X. For every (dim N)-
dimensional submanifold N ‚Ä≤ of N on which f is injective and X|f(N ‚Ä≤) Ã∏= 0 there
exist frames normal along f|N ‚Ä≤ for DX.
Proof. See Proposition 9.5 and construct, if required, a frame globally normal
along fN ‚Ä≤ from the local frames normal on the constituents of an open cover of
f(N ‚Ä≤) on each of which frames normal along f exist.
‚ñ°
Applying some freedom of the language, we may paraphrase Corollaries 9.1
and 9.2 by saying that on any C1 submanifold N of a C1 manifold M or along
a locally injective mapping f with range in M, frames locally normal on N or
along f exist for every derivation along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X provided X does not
vanish on N or on the range of f, respectively.
An important remark in connection with Proposition 9.5 and Corollaries 9.1
and 9.2 should be made. We proved the existence of frames (locally) normal on
U ‚äÜM by restricting to (subsets of) U the frames locally normal on the whole
manifold M. All frames locally normal on M are described by Theorem 9.4 and
their restrictions to (subsets of) U are, of course locally normal on U. The essential
moment is that if U Ã∏= M, then, generally, exist frames locally normal on U which
are not (locally) normal on M. In other words, the set of frames locally normal on
13In the general case, the analogues of (9.26) (resp. (9.27)) correspond to the cases when the
Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X lies (resp. does not lie) in the tangent space of the corresponding submanifold
considered as a manifold.

188
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
U is larger than the one consisting of locally normal frames obtained by frames
(locally) normal on M via restriction to (subsets of) U.
An example of these more or less intuitively clear assertions is provided by
a comparison of Theorems 9.4 and 9.1, the latter corresponding to U = {p0},
with p0 ‚ààM and Xp0 Ã∏= 0 in the above notation. Since in the both theorems xi
are coordinates in which X =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx1 (on M or at p0 resp.), one can compare the
matrices (9.31) and (9.8) by means of which is achieved the transition to normal
frames (on M or at p0 resp.). Take, for simplicity, p0 in (9.31) and (9.8) to be
one and the same point. Expanding the right-hand side of (9.31) with respect to
xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0) and taking into account (9.30), we get
A(p) =

Here B0 and Bk, k ‚â•2 are arbitrary constant matrices, det B0 Ã∏= 0, Bkl with
k, l ‚â•2 are arbitrary matrix-valued functions (in both cases the arbitrariness
comes from the arbitrariness of A0 in (9.31)), and B(x1(p)) is a Ô¨Åxed matrix-
valued function whose form depends entirely on ŒìX (B comes from the expansion
of Y in (9.31)). Comparing the last expression with (9.8), we see that the both
expressions coincide up to notation if in (9.8) we put

Exercise 9.1. Find the exact expressions for A(x)
kl for which (9.8) reduces to (9.31).
(Hint: in the both sides of (9.36), take into account all quantities up to Ô¨Åfth order
with respect to [xk(p) ‚àíxk(p0)].)
The general idea and conclusion from the above discussion is: on every U ‚äÜM
frames normal on U for a given derivation along some Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld always exist
but the ‚Äòsmaller‚Äô U is, the ‚Äòlarger‚Äô the variety of these normal frames is; this variety
is ‚Äòmaximal‚Äô at a single point and it is ‚Äòminimal‚Äô for the whole manifold M.
The aforesaid, concerning normal frames, can, evidently, mutatis mutandis
be transferred to the description of frames normal on subsets of a manifold (or
along locally injective mappings with range in it) for derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector
Ô¨Åeld in it.
10.
Normal frames and coordinates for
derivations along paths
As it is well known (see p. 11), to every injective C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM corresponds
a vector Ô¨Åeld ÀôŒ≥ along Œ≥, i.e., on Œ≥(J), called tangent to Œ≥, assigning to every point
Œ≥(s), s ‚ààJ, the vector ÀôŒ≥(s) tangent to Œ≥ at Œ≥(s) and deÔ¨Åned via (I.2.3).1 The
vector Ô¨Åeld ÀôŒ≥ can be extended to a vector Ô¨Åeld X on a neighborhood of Œ≥(J),
XŒ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥, in inÔ¨Ånitely many ways. Consider some derivation DX along X of
T 1(M). Since outside Œ≥(J) the Ô¨Åeld X is completely arbitrary, such is DX too.
One can get real proÔ¨Åt of DX if it can be made to depend only on Œ≥. Since it is
clear that outside Œ≥(J) this is impossible without some additional very restrictive
assumptions on X, let us see what happens with DX when its action is restricted
to Œ≥(J). Suppose K is a C1 tensor Ô¨Åeld of type (r, q) deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood
of Œ≥(J) (or on Œ≥(J) if dimR M = 1 and Œ≥(J) = M). If {Ei} is a frame on this
neighborhood, the components of DX in the tensor frame induced by it are (2.5).
Hereof, applying XŒ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥ and (I.2.3), we obtain

mapping s ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s) is always single-valued.

190
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
From here an important conclusion follows: if DX is a derivation along X and the
restriction of its matrix ŒìX to Œ≥(J) depends only on the path Œ≥,
ŒìX(Œ≥(s))|XŒ≥(s)= ÀôŒ≥(s) = Œì(s; Œ≥),
s ‚ààJ,
(10.1)
then the restriction to Œ≥(J) of the action of DX on any tensor Ô¨Åeld is independent
of the particular deÔ¨Ånition of X and depends only on Œ≥. Indeed, combining (10.1)
with the equation preceding it, we Ô¨Ånd

for X|Œ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥. One should have in mind the invariant character of the condi-
tion (10.1): if it holds (for some or every path Œ≥) in some frame {Ei}, then it is
valid in any other frame {E‚Ä≤

Example 10.1. An important example of a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds possessing
the property (10.1) is provided by the linear connections which, as we know from
Section 2, are derivations linear at every point of the manifold. In fact, if ‚àáis a
linear connection with coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices Œìk = [Œìi
jk], Œìi
jk being its coeÔ¨Écients,
then, by Proposition 2.2 (see also DeÔ¨Ånition 2.4), we have
ŒìX(Œ≥(s))|XŒ≥(s)= ÀôŒ≥(s) = Œìk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s)
(10.4)
as X|Œ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥. The mapping assigning to a C1 tensor Ô¨Åeld K deÔ¨Åned in a neigh-
borhood of Œ≥(J) the tensor Ô¨Åeld (‚àáXK)|Œ≥(J), where X ‚ààX(M) and X|Œ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥,
is called covariant derivative along Œ≥ generated by (associated to) ‚àá. It is denoted
by ‚àáÀôŒ≥ (and sometimes by D

Œ≥).2 According to (10.2) and (10.4), the com-
2A far more logical is the covariant derivative along Œ≥ to be denoted by ‚àáŒ≥ (see below
DeÔ¨Ånition 10.1) instead by ‚àáÀôŒ≥, but we shall follow the established tradition.

diÔ¨Äerent meaning of the symbols ‚àáX and ‚àáÀôŒ≥: in the former X is a vector Ô¨Åeld
deÔ¨Åned on the manifold M while in the latter ÀôŒ≥ is a vector Ô¨Åeld deÔ¨Åned only
along a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM and not outside the set Œ≥(J). That is why an expansion
like ‚àáÀôŒ≥ = ÀôŒ≥k‚àáEk for ÀôŒ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥k(s)Ek|Œ≥(s) is not quite correct; one should write
‚àáÀôŒ≥
		
T 1(Œ≥(J)) = ÀôŒ≥k
‚àáEk
		
T 1(Œ≥(J))

which, in more free terms, can be reduced to
‚àáÀôŒ≥ = ÀôŒ≥k(‚àáEk|Œ≥(J)) or to ‚àáÀôŒ≥|Œ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥k(s)(‚àáEk|Œ≥(s)), s ‚ààJ.
The above considerations lead to the concept of a derivation along paths
(of the tensor algebra over a manifold) assigning to every C1 injective path a
derivation along it with properties like (10.1) and (10.2).
DeÔ¨Ånition 10.1. A derivation D along paths of the tensor algebra over a C1 man-
ifold M, is a mapping assigning to every C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM without self-
intersections a mapping DŒ≥, called derivation along Œ≥ (of the algebra of C1 tensor
Ô¨Åelds along Œ≥), from the algebra of C1 tensor Ô¨Åelds along Œ≥ into the one of C0
tensor Ô¨Åelds,
DŒ≥ : T 1(Œ≥(J)) ‚ÜíT 0(Œ≥(J)),
such that:
(i) DŒ≥(K + L) = DŒ≥K + DŒ≥L,
K, L ‚ààTr;1
s (Œ≥(J));
(ii) DŒ≥(K ‚äóL) = (DŒ≥K) ‚äóL + K ‚äó(DŒ≥L),

(iii c) DŒ≥ : T0;1

(iv) DŒ≥(g) = ÀôŒ≥(g),

Comments 10.1. This deÔ¨Ånition is similar to the DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1 of a linear con-
nection: the Ô¨Åst two properties of the latter one are removed and all covariant
derivatives along a vector Ô¨Åeld X are replaced with derivatives along Œ≥. Hence the
points (2)‚Äì(6) of comments I.3.1 can be repeated mutatis mutandis. Hereof we can
say that DŒ≥: is K-linear, satisÔ¨Åes the Leibnitz rule (with respect to the tensor mul-
tiplication), preserves the types of the tensor Ô¨Åelds, commutes with all contraction
operators, and on scalar functions reduces to the vector Ô¨Åeld ÀôŒ≥ tangent to Œ≥.

Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Remark 10.1. In connection with the theory of derivations (along paths) in vector
bundles (see Subsection IV.2.3), the so-deÔ¨Åned derivations along paths should be
called section- or tensor-derivations along paths as the tensor Ô¨Åelds are, in fact, sec-
tions of the corresponding tensor bundles over a manifold (see Subsection IV.2.4).
At the moment, this more complicated name is not required and, respectively, it
will not be employed in the present chapter. (For details, see the deÔ¨Ånition of a
section-derivation along paths on page 221 and Subsection IV.13.1.)
Suppose D is a derivation along paths, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is injective and C1, and
{Ei} is a C1 frame on Œ≥(J) which may be deÔ¨Åned and outside Œ≥(J). By con-
dition (iii b) of DeÔ¨Ånition 10.1, there exist unique functions ŒìŒ≥
i
j for which the
expansion
DŒ≥(Ei) =: ŒìŒ≥
j
iEj
(10.6)
holds. They are called (local) components of DŒ≥ or of D along Œ≥. We shall write
Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) for the value of ŒìŒ≥
i
j at Œ≥(s), ŒìŒ≥
i
j : Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíŒìi
j(s; Œ≥) which is correct as Œ≥
is supposed to be injective. The components of DŒ≥ uniquely describe it in {Ei} as
from DeÔ¨Ånition 10.1 follows that the components of DŒ≥(K) for K ‚ààTr;1
q (Œ≥(J)) in
the tensor frame induced by {Ei} are

(10.7)
which can be veriÔ¨Åed by direct calculation.
Comparing (10.7) with (10.2), we conclude that to every derivation D along
vector Ô¨Åelds, whose components have the property (10.1), there corresponds a
derivation along paths D such that D: Œ≥ ‚ÜíDX
		
T 1(Œ≥(J)) for X ‚ààX(M) with
X|Œ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥. A particular example is provided by the covariant derivative along
paths associating to Œ≥ the covariant derivative ‚àáÀôŒ≥ along Œ≥ with ‚àábeing a linear
connection.
If the frame {Ei} is change to {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj

degenerate matrix A = [Aj

Introducing the matrix ŒìŒ≥ :=

this as (cf. (2.11))

10. Normal frames for derivations along paths
193
Notice, the main diÔ¨Äerence between the pairs of transformations (2.10) and (2.11),
on one hand, and (10.8) and (10.9), on another hand, is that the former ones are
deÔ¨Åned on an arbitrary neighborhood of M, while the latter ones have a sense only
along Œ≥, i.e., on Œ≥(J). If we put Œì(s; Œ≥) = ŒìŒ≥(Œ≥(s)), s ‚ààJ, which is the matrix of
DŒ≥ (in {Ei}) at the point Œ≥(s), the change (10.9) takes the form (10.3), as one can
expect. If one is interested in holonomic frames, like

Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi

with {xi} being
coordinates in U ‚äÜM and U ‚à©Œ≥(J) Ã∏= ‚àÖ, the coordinates change {xi} ‚Üí{x‚Ä≤ i}
will imply, e.g., the change (10.8) with Ai
j =
‚àÇxi
‚àÇx‚Ä≤ j and all quantities should be
restricted on U ‚à©Œ≥(J).
Example 10.2. It is easily seen that, by virtue of (10.4), the component‚Äôs matrix
of a covariant derivative ‚àáÀôŒ≥ along Œ≥ is
ŒìŒ≥ = Œìk ÀôŒ≥k
(10.10)
where Œìk :=

Œìi
jk

are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of a linear connection ‚àá.
A derivation along paths is called diÔ¨Äerentiable of class Ck or simply of class
Ck, if its matrix is of class Ck with respect to all coordinate frames or the ones
obtainable from them by means of Ck+1 transformations (cf. similar convention
concerning derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds on page 146).
Now the problem for the existence and properties of a special kind of frames,
called normal, in which the components of a derivation along paths vanish can be
posed. It has two sides: local, along particular path, and global, along every path.
We shall start with the former case.
DeÔ¨Ånition 10.2. Let D be a derivation along paths and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be injective C1
path. A frame {E‚Ä≤
i} deÔ¨Åned on Œ≥(J) or on its subset is called normal for DŒ≥ (or for
D along Œ≥) if in it the components of DŒ≥ (of D along Œ≥) vanish. A frame deÔ¨Åned
on a neighborhood (of part) of Œ≥(J) is called normal for DŒ≥ if its restriction to
Œ≥(J) is normal for DŒ≥.
Frames {E‚Ä≤
i} normal along particular path Œ≥ for a C1 derivation D along
paths always exist and can easily be found on the base of the transformation
law (10.9) of the components of D along Œ≥.
Theorem 10.1. If D is a C0 derivation along paths in a C2 manifold M and
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is injective and C1, then all frames (globally) normal for D along Œ≥,
i.e., for DŒ≥, are {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj}, where {Ei} is arbitrary frame along Œ≥ and A = [Ai
j]
is given by
A(Œ≥(s)) = Y (s, s0; ‚àíŒìŒ≥ ‚ó¶Œ≥)A0,
(10.11)
in which Y is the unique solution of (II.3.17), s ‚ààJ, s0 ‚ààJ is Ô¨Åxed, ŒìŒ≥ is the
matrix of D in {Ei}, and A0 is constant non-degenerate matrix.
Proof. If {Ei} is an arbitrary frame on Œ≥(J), a frame {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} is normal along
Œ≥, Œì‚Ä≤
Œ≥ = 0, iÔ¨Äthe normal frame equation
dA(Œ≥(s))
ds
+ Œì(s; Œ≥)A(Œ≥(s)) = 0
(10.12)

194
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
holds along Œ≥, where A := [Ai
j]: Œ≥(J) ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K) is of class C1 and (10.3)
was used. By Remark II.3.9 on page 96, the general solution of the last equation
with respect to A is given by (10.11).
‚ñ°
Since the provided by Theorem 10.1 frames normal for a derivation DŒ≥ along
a concrete path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM are deÔ¨Åned only on Œ≥(J), the problem for their holo-
nomicity is ill-posed. The correct question is: can these frames be (locally) ex-
tended in a holonomic or anholonomic way on a neighborhood with non-empty
intersection with Œ≥(J)? As the existence of anholonomic extensions is clear and
beyond doubt, we shall show the existence of holonomic extensions on which base,
if required, anholonomic ones can be constructed. Looking on M as on a real man-
ifold (of dimension dimR M = 2 dim M if M is complex) and admitting Œ≥ to be
regular, the needed result is an evident corollary of the following lemma.
Lemma 10.1. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be injective C1 regular path in a C1 real manifold M
and {Ei} be a frame deÔ¨Åned on Œ≥(J). For every s0 ‚ààJ, there exists a chart (U, y)
with U ‚àãŒ≥(s0) such that the coordinate frame

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇyi

reduces along Œ≥ to {Ei},
‚àÇ
‚àÇyi
		
U‚à©Œ≥(J) = Ei
		
U‚à©Œ≥(J), i.e., in a neighborhood of every point in Œ≥(J) the initial
frame {Ei} can be extended in a holonomic way.
Remark 10.2. Since now Œ≥(J) is one-dimensional (real) submanifold of M, this
lemma is a corollary of Lemma II.5.2 on page 116. Because of the importance of this
result, we present here its independent proof following the one of [76, Lemma 4.1].
Proof. Since Œ≥ is C1, regular, and without self-intersections, for every s0 ‚ààJ
the special chart (U1, x), with U1 ‚àãŒ≥(s0) and described in Subsection II.3.2 on
page 94, can be constructed. Recall, (see (II.3.12) and (II.3.13)), for p ‚ààU1, we
have x(p) = (s, t) for some s ‚ààJ1 := {œÉ|œÉ ‚ààJ, Œ≥(œÉ) ‚ààU1} ‚äÜJ and t ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1
and x(Œ≥(s)) = (s, t0), s ‚ààJ1, for Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààRdimR M‚àí1. Let the non-degenerate
matrix B = [Bi
j(s)], s ‚ààJ1, be deÔ¨Åned via the expansion
Ei|Œ≥(s) = Bj

and B(s) is non-degenerate, the transformation {xi} ‚Üí{yi} is well-deÔ¨Åned C1
diÔ¨Äeomorphism on U := x‚àí1(J1, V ) ‚äÜU1 for some neighborhood V of t0 in
RdimR M‚àí1. Hence (U, y) is a chart of M with U ‚àãŒ≥(s0) and the coordinate frame
generated by the associated with it coordinates {yi} has the following basic vectors

Œ≥(s) = Ei|Œ≥(s) and, consequently,

is a holonomic extension of
{Ei} in the neighborhood U of Œ≥(s0).
‚ñ°
The next proposition reveals the complete (local) consistency between the
normal frames provided by Theorem 10.1 for the covariant derivatives along paths
(generated by a linear connection ‚àá) and the ones given via Theorem II.3.1 on
page 97.
Proposition 10.1. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be a C1 regular injective path in a C1 manifold
M endowed with a C0 linear connection ‚àá. The frames on Œ≥(J) normal along Œ≥
for ‚àáand the ones normal for the covariant derivative ‚àáÀôŒ≥ along Œ≥ are identical.
Proof. If a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} is normal along Œ≥ for ‚àá, then, due to (10.10), the compo-
nents‚Äô matrix of ‚àáÀôŒ≥ in {E‚Ä≤
i|Œ≥(J)} is Œì‚Ä≤
Œ≥ = Œì‚Ä≤
k ÀôŒ≥k = 
k 0 √ó ÀôŒ≥k = 0 as, by deÔ¨Ånition,
in a frame normal for ‚àáthe coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices Œì‚Ä≤
k of ‚àávanish.
To prove the converse assertion, we shall use the special chart (U1, x), in a
neighborhood of some point Œ≥(s0) ‚ààŒ≥(J), constructed at the beginning of Sub-
section II.3.2. Since in the frame

Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
		
U1

we have ÀôŒ≥k = Œ¥k
1, in it (10.10)
gives the matrix ŒìŒ≥ of ‚àáÀôŒ≥ as ŒìŒ≥ = ‚àíŒì1. Hereof, applying Theorem 10.1, we
see that a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} on Œ≥(J) normal for ‚àáÀôŒ≥ has on Œ≥(J) ‚à©U1 basic vectors
E‚Ä≤
i|Œ≥(s) = Aj
i(Œ≥(s)) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxj
		
Œ≥(s) for s ‚ààJ1 := {œÉ|œÉ ‚ààJ, Œ≥(œÉ) ‚ààU1} ‚àãs0 with
A(Œ≥(s)) = Y (s, s0; ‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥)A0
(10.15)
which, up to notation, coincides with the matrix (II.3.22) on page 97 transforming

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
		
Œ≥(J)

into a frame on Œ≥(J) normal for ‚àá. So, by Theorem II.3.1, locally, i.e.,
on Œ≥(J1), every frame {E‚Ä≤
i} normal for ‚àáÀôŒ≥ is a restriction along Œ≥ (more precisely,
to Œ≥(J1)) of a frame normal for ‚àáalong Œ≥.
‚ñ°
In short, admitting some abuse of the language, we can say that the frames
normal along a path for a linear connection are normal for the generated by it
covariant derivative along paths and vice versa.
One should have in mind a signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence between the normal frames
provided by Theorem 10.1 for ‚àáÀôŒ≥ and the ones provided by Theorem II.3.1 along
Œ≥ for ‚àá: the former normal frames are global, i.e., deÔ¨Åned along the whole path Œ≥,
on the set Œ≥(J), while the latter ones are local, i.e., deÔ¨Åned only on a neighborhood
in Œ≥(J) of each point in Œ≥(J).

196
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
Now we turn our attention to the ‚Äòglobal‚Äô case.
DeÔ¨Ånition 10.3. A frame {Ei} deÔ¨Åned on a subset U ‚äÜM or on a larger set
(if U Ã∏= M) is called normal on U for a derivation D along paths if for every
C1 injective path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU lying entirely in U the restricted frame {Ei|Œ≥(J)} is
normal along Œ≥ for the derivation DŒ≥, D: Œ≥ ‚ÜíDŒ≥. In particular, a frame normal
on M for D is called simply normal for D.
Proposition 10.2. A derivation along paths admits frames normal on U ‚äÜM if
and only if on U it is a covariant derivative along paths induced by some linear
connection for which frames normal on U exist.
Proof. Suppose, a derivation D along paths admits a frame {E‚Ä≤
i} normal on U.
Let {Ei} be a frame on U and A = [Aj
i]: U ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K) be deÔ¨Åned via
the expansion E‚Ä≤
i|Œ≥(s) = Aj
i(Œ≥(s))Ej|Œ≥(s). By Theorem 10.1, the matrix Œì(s; Œ≥) of
D along arbitrary path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU in U and the matrix-valued function A are
connected by (10.11) or, equivalently, satisfy (10.12). Hence, from (10.12), we get
Œì(s; Œ≥) = ‚àídA(Œ≥(s))
ds
A‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) = ‚àíEk(A)|Œ≥(s) ÀôŒ≥k(s)A‚àí1(Œ≥(s))
where ÀôŒ≥k are the components of ÀôŒ≥ in {Ek}. Therefore the matrix ŒìŒ≥ of DŒ≥ in
{Ek|Œ≥(J)} is (10.10) with
Œìk : p ‚ÜíŒìk(p) = ‚àí(Ek(A))|pA‚àí1(p).
(10.16)
Since a simple veriÔ¨Åcation shows that these matrices Œìk transform according
to (I.5.3), they are matrices of the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection ‚àáwhich,
due to Œì(s; Œ≥) = Œìk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s), is such that DŒ≥ = ‚àáÀôŒ≥, i.e., the covariant deriva-
tive along paths generated by ‚àácoincides with the initial derivation D along paths.
As {E‚Ä≤
i} is normal for D, in it is fulÔ¨Ålled 0 = Œì‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) = Œì‚Ä≤
k(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥‚Ä≤ k(s) for arbitrary
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU. Hereof Œì‚Ä≤
k(p)ÀôŒ≥‚Ä≤ k(s0) = 0 for every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU with Œ≥(s0) = p ‚ààU
for some s0 ‚ààJ which implies Œì‚Ä≤
k|U = 0 and, consequently, {E‚Ä≤
i} is normal on U
for ‚àá.
Conversely, suppose DŒ≥ = ‚àáÀôŒ≥ for a linear connection ‚àáfor which a frame
{E‚Ä≤
i} normal on U exist. Then the matrix ŒìŒ≥ of DŒ≥ is given by (10.10) for all
frames {Ei} on U and all paths Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU in U. In particular, for Ei = E‚Ä≤
i|Œ≥(J),
we have Œì‚Ä≤
Œ≥ : Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíŒì‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) = Œì‚Ä≤
k(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s) = 
k 0 √ó ÀôŒ≥k(s) = 0 as Œì‚Ä≤
k = 0 in a
frame {E‚Ä≤
i} normal for ‚àá. Therefore ŒìŒ≥ = 0 in {E‚Ä≤
i} for every path Œ≥ lying entirely
in U and, by DeÔ¨Ånition 10.3, the frame {E‚Ä≤
i} is normal for DŒ≥ = ‚àáÀôŒ≥.
‚ñ°
The meaning of Proposition 10.2 is that the condition on a derivation D
along paths to admit frames normal on U ‚äÜM is so strong that it reduces such
a derivation to a covariant derivative along paths admitting frames normal on
U. Since, by Proposition 10.1, such a covariant derivative along paths is always
generated by a linear connection ‚àáadmitting frames normal on U, all problems
concerning frames normal for D are reduced to similar problems for ‚àá, which we
have investigated earlier at length.

11.
On frames simultaneously normal
for two derivations
The problems concerning frames simultaneously normal for two derivations (along
vector Ô¨Åelds, Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, paths, Ô¨Åxed path) are new and not investigated.
They arise naturally in some physical theories of gravity in which as a space-time
model is taken a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold endowed with two, generally or initially
independent, linear connections. Such are the metric-aÔ¨Éne theories [36, 92], the
ones with metric and background aÔ¨Éne connection [93,94] in which there are two
connections, one of them being a Riemannian connection induced by some Rie-
mannian metric, as well as the theories with covariant and contravariant aÔ¨Éne
connection [35, 95, 96] in which two diÔ¨Äerent linear connections in the tangent
and cotangent bundles are used.1 The importance of the normal frames in these
theories comes from the fact that the normal frames are the mathematical tool
for description of the physical concept ‚Äòinertial frame‚Äô [97]. So, the equivalence
principle selects only linear connections possessing normal frames for the descrip-
tion of the pure gravity. Hereof, if two linear connections admit common normal
frame(s), they can serve together as a mathematical base for a gravitational theory,
otherwise only one of them should be selected for the same purpose.
Below in this section, we shall present some quite simple results whose main
moral is: frames simultaneously normal for two arbitrary and diÔ¨Äerent derivations
(along vector Ô¨Åelds, Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, paths, Ô¨Åxed path), generally, do not exist;
however, there are some exceptions. Physically, this can be interpreted as: in a
gravity theory with two linear connections only one of them can describe the
gravity directly, the other one may be connected with it but, generally, it should
be primary related to an object diÔ¨Äerent from the gravity. However, there exist
exceptions from this conclusion which will be pointed.
The order of the rigorous results comes now.
Proposition 11.1. Let D(1) and D(2) be derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds admitting
frames normal on U ‚äÜM. There exist frames normal on U for D(1) and D(2)
simultaneously iÔ¨ÄD(1)|U = D(2)|U.
Proof. Let {Ei} be a frame on (a neighborhood of) U and Œì(a)
k
be the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô
matrices of D(a), a = 1, 2. (Recall, by Proposition 3.1, the derivations are linear
on U.) A frame {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} is normal for D(1) and D(2) iÔ¨Ä(3.5) holds for Œì(a)
k
instead of Œìk: (Œì(a)
k A + Ek(A))|U = 0, a = 1, 2, A = [Aj
i] which is possible iÔ¨Ä
Œì(1)
k |U = Œì(2)
k |U as A is non-degenerate which, in its turn, means D(1)|U = D(2)|U.
‚ñ°
1In the last case, the two connections are equivalent to a single operator ‚àásatisfying all con-
ditions in DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1 but the condition (vii); see the deÔ¨Ånition of a mixed linear connection
on page 199.

Proposition 11.4. Let the derivations
(1)DŒ≥ and
(2)DŒ≥ along one and the same
C1 injective path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM admit normal frames (along Œ≥). There is a frame
simultaneously normal for (1)DŒ≥ and (2)DŒ≥ if and only if (1)DŒ≥ = (2)DŒ≥.
Proof. If {Ei} is a frame on Œ≥(J) and the frame {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} is normal for (1)DŒ≥,
i.e., (10.12) holds for the matrices Œì(1)
Œ≥
of (1)DŒ≥ in {Ei} for ŒìŒ≥, ŒìŒ≥ = Œì(1)
Œ≥ , then
{E‚Ä≤

Proof. The result follows from Proposition 11.4 for arbitrary path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM.
The assertion is also a consequence of Propositions 10.2 and 11.1 as any linear
connection is a (linear) derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds.

Now we want to say a few words on the physical theories with covariant and
contravariant aÔ¨Éne (linear) connections. As it was mentioned in Footnote 1 on
page 197, their mathematical base are the so-called linear connections of mixed
type [41, ¬ß 37], or, simply, mixed linear connections which are a generalization of the
linear connections. A mapping ‚àáis called mixed linear connection (of type (1, 1)) if
it satisÔ¨Åes all conditions of DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1 on page 21 except conditions (vii) in it.

It is almost evident, ‚àáis ordinary linear connection if and only if one, and

(11.9)
the last of which is valid in, e.g., a pair of dual frame and coframe. Consequently,
any one of these equalities is equivalent to the conditions (vii) in DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1.
DeÔ¨Ånition 11.1. A pair

{Ei}, {Ei}

of a frame and coframe is called normal on
U ‚äÜM for a mixed linear connection ‚àáif in it all of the coeÔ¨Écients, contravariant
and covariant ones, of ‚àávanish on U.
Proposition 11.7. If only changes preserving the action of the coframe‚Äôs basic vec-
tors on the frame‚Äôs ones are considered,5 a mixed linear connection ‚àáadmits a
pair of such frame and coframe normal on U ‚äÜM, if and only if on U ‚àáreduces
to ordinary linear connection for which frames normal on U exist.
Proof. If

{Ei}, {Ei}

, with Ei(Ej) constant under transformations of the frame
and coframe, is normal on U for ‚àá, then {Ei} is normal on U for
(1)‚àáand
(2)‚àásimultaneously and, by Proposition 11.1, (1)‚àá|U = (1)‚àá|U which, as we said
above, implies ‚àá|U =
(1)‚àá|U and {Ei} is normal on U for ‚àá|U. Conversely, if
‚àáis ordinary linear connection and {Ei} is a frame normal on U for ‚àá, then
‚àá= (1)‚àá= (2)‚àáand

{Ei}, {Ei}

, with invariant Ei(Ej), is normal on U for ‚àá
considered as a mixed linear connection.
‚ñ°
3In particular such are all pairs of a frame and the coframe dual to it.
4In some sense [95, 96] (1)‚àá(resp. (2)‚àá) is the ‚Äòcontravariant‚Äô (resp. covariant) component
of ‚àá.
5In particular, such is the set of all dual frames and coframes.

11. Frames normal for two derivations
201
Consider now the general case, when the frame {Ei} and coframe {Ei} are
completely arbitrary, B Ã∏= A‚àí1. By virtue of (11.5‚Ä≤) and (11.6‚Ä≤), the pair

{E‚Ä≤

(11.10a)
(‚àíŒìkB‚àí1 + Ek(B‚àí1))|U = 0
(11.10b)
holds. These equations are equivalent to the assertions that, respectively, the frame
{E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} is normal on U for the linear connection (1)‚àáand the frame {E‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
i =
(B‚àí1)j
iEj} is normal on U for the linear connection
(2)‚àá.6 These very simple
results imply the following theorem.
Theorem 11.1. A mixed linear connection ‚àáadmits frames normal on U ‚äÜM
if and only if the associated to it linear connections (1)‚àáand (2)‚àáadmit frames
normal on U. Moreover, if frames normal on U for (1)‚àáand (2)‚àáexist and {Ei}
and {Ei} are respectively frame and coframe on (a neighborhood of ) U, then all
pairs of frames and coframes normal on U for ‚àáare

{E‚Ä≤
i = Aj


where {E‚Ä≤
i} is a frame normal on U for (1)‚àáand {E‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
i = (B‚àí1)j
iEj} is a
frame normal on U for (2)‚àá.
Remark 11.1. For
(1)‚àáÃ∏=
(2)‚àá, the second part of the theorem does not con-
tradict to Propositions 11.7 and 11.1 because nowhere is imposed the additional
condition (1)‚àáand (2)‚àáto have a common frame normal on U, which could hap-
pen iÔ¨Ä(11.10a) and (11.10b) have a common solution with respect to A and B‚àí1
respectively.
From the above discussion the following conclusions can be made.
If pairs of frames {Ei} and coframes {Ei} for which the functions f j
i :=
Ej(Ei) are invariant under the change (11.4) are considered, a mixed linear con-
nection does not admit normal frames unless it is an ordinary linear connection for
which normal frames exist; in particular, this is true if only pairs of dual frames
and coframes, for which f j
i = Œ¥j
i , are taken into account.
If the considered frames and coframes are completely arbitrary, with no ad-
ditional conditions on them imposed, then all problems concerning normal frames
for a mixed linear connection ‚àáare reduced to the same problems but for the
linear connections (1)‚àáand (2)‚àá.
Consequently, in the both cases, any problem concerning normal frames for
mixed linear connections can equivalently be (re)formulated in terms of similar
6From here immediately follows an independent proof of Proposition 11.7: If E‚Ä≤ i(E‚Ä≤
j) =
Ei(Ej), then B‚àí1 = A is a solution of (11.10b), so E‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
i
= E‚Ä≤
i and hence {E‚Ä≤
i} is a common
normal frame for
(1)‚àáand
(2)‚àáwhich, by Proposition 11.1, implies
(1)‚àá=
(2)‚àá. The last
result yields ‚àá= (1)‚àá= (2)‚àá.

Normal frames for linear connections (review)
Since the linear connections Ô¨Ånd a far more numerous applications than the other
derivations (along vector Ô¨Åelds), in the present section are summarized the main
ideas and are discussed the results concerning normal frames for linear connections
which are spread over the preceding material in this chapter.
First of all, recall that a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds, which is linear on the
whole manifold M, is a linear connection on M. More generally, a derivation D
along vector Ô¨Åelds which is linear on some subset(s) of M coincides on it (them)
with a linear connection whose coeÔ¨Écients on this (these) set(s) coincide with the
ones of D. This fact allows the results on normal frames for derivations along
vector Ô¨Åelds to be applied directly for ‚Äòlocal‚Äô linear connections, i.e., ones that are
deÔ¨Åned on a proper subset of the whole manifold M.
In Chapter II, a complete description of the frames and coordinates normal
on submanifolds of M and along paths in M for linear connections deÔ¨Åned on the
whole manifold M was presented. In the present chapter (Sections 3‚Äì7) analogous
results for derivations D along vector Ô¨Åelds were proved. Frames normal on U ‚äÜM
for D exist iÔ¨ÄD|U = ‚àá|U where ‚àáis linear connection on U or on a larger set (if
U Ã∏= M) and ‚àáadmits frames normal on U; moreover, if such ‚àáexists, all frames
normal on U for D are normal on U for ‚àáand vice versa. Reversing the situation,
we have
Assertion 12.1. If ‚àáis a linear connection deÔ¨Åned on U, then all problems con-
cerning the frames normal on U ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜU for ‚àá, if any, are equivalent to the same
problems for a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds such that D|U = ‚àá|U and D is not
linear everywhere on M\U, i.e., outside U (if U Ã∏= M).
From here an essential conclusion follows.
Conclusion 12.1. The linear connections deÔ¨Åned on M (resp. on subsets of M) are
globally (resp. locally) the only derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds for which frames
normal on M (resp. on the corresponding subsets of M) could exist.
As we proved, normal frames always exist at a single point or along given
(locally injective) path; on submanifolds of dimension at least two, normal frames
exist as an exception iÔ¨Äsome additional conditions, derived here, are satisÔ¨Åed.
In Section 8, we studied problems devoted to frames normal along (locally
injective) mappings like f : N ‚ÜíM, N and M being manifolds, for derivations

12. Normal frames for linear connections (review)
203
D along vector Ô¨Åelds. The main results are expressed by Theorem 8.4, the Ô¨Årst
assertion of which can be restated as (see also Theorems 7.1 and II.5.2): A deriva-
tion D along vector Ô¨Åelds admits frames normal along locally injective mapping
f : N ‚ÜíM if and only if for every (dim N)-dimensional submanifold N ‚Ä≤ of N such
that f|N ‚Ä≤ is injective, the restriction of D to f(N ‚Ä≤) (i.e., to T 1(f(N ‚Ä≤))) coincides
with some linear connection (possibly restricted to f(N ‚Ä≤)) for which frames nor-
mal on f(N ‚Ä≤) exist. Therefore the exploration of frames normal along f for D can
equivalently be reformulated in terms of linear connections. Reversing, ones again,
the situation, we get
Assertion 12.2. If ‚àáis a linear connection, all problems regarding frames normal
along f for ‚àáare equivalent to the same problems for a derivation D along vector
Ô¨Åelds such that D|f(N ‚Ä≤) = ‚àá|f(N ‚Ä≤) and D is not linear on M\f(N ‚Ä≤).
Consequently a conclusion similar to the above one can be made.
Conclusion 12.2. Locally the linear connections are the only derivations along
vector Ô¨Åelds for which frames normal along locally injective mappings exist. If
dimR N = 0, 1, then such frames always exist, otherwise some additional conditions
must be satisÔ¨Åed for their existence.
The only case, when the linear connections are not ‚Äòselected‚Äô from the view-
point of normal frames or coordinates, is the one for derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector
Ô¨Åeld (Section 9). This is not surprising, on the opposite such a result is quite
natural as the linear connections are special type of derivations along (arbitrary)
vector Ô¨Åelds, not along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld. Of course, all results of Section 9 are
completely valid for every covariant derivative ‚àáX along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X.1 We
hope that they can be useful in theoretical physics where derivatives with respect
to a Ô¨Åxed vector X Ô¨Ånd applications. The role of X can be played by a number of
vectorial physical quantities, for instance it could be the velocity Ô¨Åeld of a Ô¨Çuid,
some force Ô¨Åeld, the (four-)potential of an electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld, etc.
Since the derivations along a Ô¨Åxed path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM can be considered as a
suitable restriction of special kind of derivations along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X with
XŒ≥(J) = ÀôŒ≥, the just said for such derivations is valid mutatis mutandis for deriva-
tions along a Ô¨Åxed path. The derivations along a Ô¨Åxed path always admit frames
normal along that path (Theorem 10.1), in particular this is true for the covari-
ant derivative ‚àáÀôŒ≥ along Œ≥ generated by some linear connection ‚àá. An interesting
result is the coincidence of the frames normal along Œ≥ for ‚àáÀôŒ≥ and for ‚àá(Propo-
sition 10.1). As derivatives like ‚àáÀôŒ≥ often arise in physics, where ÀôŒ≥ is interpreted
as a velocity of a (point) particle moving along Œ≥, it is possible that the results of
Section 10 could Ô¨Ånd suitable physical applications.
If derivations along arbitrary paths are considered, then, as one can expected,
such derivations admit normal frames iÔ¨Äthey are covariant derivatives generated
1Following the terminology of Section 2 (see, in particular, DeÔ¨Ånition 2.3), one can call ‚àáX
a linear connection along X: a linear connection ‚àáis a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds which is
linear at every point and ‚àáX is the value of ‚àáat X (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1).

204
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
by linear connections for which normal frames exist (Proposition 10.2). This re-
veals, once again, the privileged role of the linear connections between the other
derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds.
If one wants frames simultaneously normal for two derivations along vector
Ô¨Åelds (resp. along paths) to exist, then these derivations must (locally) coincide
(according to Proposition 11.1 (resp. 11.5)) and, consequently, they are globally
or locally identical linear connections (resp. identical covariant derivatives along
paths) (see Proposition 10.2) induced by some linear connection (see also Propo-
sition 10.1).
By Theorem 11.1, all problems regarding pairs of a frame and coframe nor-
mal for a mixed linear connection are equivalent to similar ones for a pair of linear
connections (its ‚Äòcontravariant‚Äô and ‚Äòcovariant‚Äô components). If these linear con-
nections admit normal frames, the pairs of a frame and coframe normal for the
mixed linear connections exist. It is important to be noted, such pairs of a frame
and coframe for a mixed linear connection, which is not (ordinary) linear connec-
tion, may exist if no additional conditions on the employed frames and coframes
are imposed, which is a highly unusual situation. Practically everywhere, the con-
sidered frames {Ei} and coframes {Ei} are supposed to be dual, Ei(Ej) = Œ¥i
j,
or such that the functions f i
j := Ei(Ej) to be invariant under changes of the
frames and coframes. If this is the case, then pairs of a frame and coframe nor-
mal for a mixed linear connection may exist if it is an ordinary linear connection
(Proposition 11.7).
13.
Examples
In the previous sections, we have demonstrated that diÔ¨Äerent problems concerning
frames normal for derivations along (arbitrary) vector Ô¨Åelds and paths are more or
less reduced to similar problems for suitable linear connections. For that reason,
the reader is referred to Sections I.7 and II.6 for instances of normal frames of this
kind for linear connections.
Below will be presented several examples of frames normal for derivations
along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld or Ô¨Åxed path. As it was mentioned earlier, these cases have
no analogues in the theory of frames normal for linear connections (along arbitrary
vector Ô¨Åelds).
Example 13.1 (Covariant derivatives). If ‚àáis a linear connection and X is a Ô¨Åxed
vector Ô¨Åeld on a manifold M, then ‚àáX is a derivation along X whose coeÔ¨Écients
in a frame {Ei} are ŒìX
i
j = Œìi
jkXk (see Proposition 2.2), where Œìi
jk are the
coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáin {Ei}.
Let M be of class C1 and p0 ‚ààM. If Xp0 = 0, then all frames/coordinates in
a neighborhood of p0 are normal for ‚àáX at p0 as ŒìX
i
j(p0) = 0. Suppose Xp0 Ã∏= 0.
Then, in the notation and suppositions of Theorems 9.1 or 9.2, all respectively
frames {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} and coordinate systems {zi} deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood of

(13.2)
Similarly, applying Theorem 9.3 or Proposition 9.4, one can describe the
frames or coordinates, respectively, (locally) normal for ‚àáalong a Ô¨Åxed path.
Example 13.2 (Lie derivatives). The Lie derivative L (see Example 2.1 and Sub-
section IV.13.3 below) is a fundamental derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds on any C1
manifold [11]. If X ‚ààX1(M), the coeÔ¨Écients of the Lie derivative LX along (with
respect to) X are deÔ¨Åned by
LXEi =: ŒìX
j
iEj
in a frame {Ei} and, due to (2.1), are (X = XiEi)
ŒìX
i
j = ‚àíEj(Xi) + Ci
kjXk.
(13.3)
Consequently, L is nowhere linear derivation, precisely the only set U ‚äÜM on
which ŒìX
i
j = XkŒìi
jk for some functions Œìi
jk : U ‚ÜíK and all X, is the empty
set, U = ‚àÖ. Thus Proposition 3.1 implies the non-existence of frames normal for
L on any subset U ‚äÜM.
Let now X be a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld. Suppose U ‚äÜM and X|U = 0. If
Ej(Xi)|U = 0 (which is equivalent LX to be the zero derivation on U), then
any frame or coordinate system deÔ¨Åned on (a neighborhood of) U is normal for
LX on U. Otherwise, i.e., if Ej(Xi)|p Ã∏= 0 for some p ‚ààU, frames/coordinates
normal on U for LX do not exist.
Let p0 ‚ààU and Xp0 Ã∏= 0. Then, in the notation and suppositions of The-
orem 9.1 or 9.2, all respectively frames {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} and coordinate systems
{zi} deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood of p0 and normal at p0 are such that (see (9.8)

Similarly, applying Theorem 9.3 or Proposition 9.4, one can describe the
frames or coordinates, respectively, (locally) normal for L along a Ô¨Åxed path. For
instance, if the condition (9.15) is not valid for a Ô¨Åxed (regular, C1, and locally
injective) path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, then all frames locally normal along Œ≥ are, in the
notation of Theorem 9.3 and its proof,

Example 13.3 (Tensor Ô¨Åelds of type (1, 1)). As we said in Example 2.1, a tensor
Ô¨Åeld S of type (1, 1) on a manifold M can be considered as a derivation. Hence
S : X(M) ‚àãX ‚ÜíS ‚ààT1
1(M) is a derivation along (relative to) vector Ô¨Åelds; it
can be called (generalized) Frenet-Serret derivative due to the considerations in
Example 13.6 below. If X is a vector Ô¨Åeld and {Ei} is a frame, then (2.2) yields
the following coeÔ¨Écients of S (considered as a derivation):
ŒìX
i
j = Si
j.
(13.7)
Since the coeÔ¨Écients of S along X are independent of X, Proposition 3.1 implies
a non-existence of frames/coordinates normal for S on any subset (unless S = 0).
However, if we consider X as an arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, frames or coor-
dinates normal for S exist on any subset, according to the results of Section 9. For
instance, Theorems 9.1 and 9.2 (resp. 9.3 and Proposition 9.4) with respectively
ŒìX = [Si
j] and ŒìX

j = Si
j give the complete (local) description of all frames and
coordinates, respectively, normal at a single point (resp. along a path).

(13.9)
Example 13.4 (General derivations and particular cases). As we know from DeÔ¨Å-
nition 2.3, any derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds is a sum of the Lie derivative and a
mapping S : X(M) ‚ÜíT1
1(M) assigning a tensor Ô¨Åeld SX of type (1, 1) to a vector
Ô¨Åeld X; the choice SX = Œ£X, with Œ£X deÔ¨Åned by (2.4), corresponds to a linear
connection ‚àá. According to (2.7), the coeÔ¨Écients of D and their matrix (at X)
are

(13.11)
Consequently, if X is Ô¨Åxed, frames and/or coordinates normal for D on some subset
can be found by applying the results of Section 9, precisely by substituting in them
the equations (13.10) and (13.11). We are not going to write the corresponding
explicit expressions as the mentioned substitution is a trivial technical task.
Suppose on a manifold M is given a derivation DX along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
X and a linear connection ‚àá. As a result of (2.3) and Example 2.2, we can write
the representations
DX = LX + SX
(13.12a)
DX = ‚àáX + SX ‚àíŒ£X.
(13.12b)
The former equality (which is independent of the existence of ‚àá) is suitable for
general mathematical considerations, while the latter one Ô¨Ånds applications in
some physical applications.
Here is a list of four derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X based on the
decompositions (13.12):

Combining this result with Proposition 10.1, we can assert that all frames and/or
coordinates normal for the Fermi derivative along a (Ô¨Åxed) geodesic path Œ≥ coincide
with the ones for the Riemannian connection ‚àá{} along the path Œ≥. For further
details on frames normal along a (geodesic) path for a linear connection, the reader
is referred to Section II.3; for a concrete instance of this kind, see Example II.6.8.

Lemma 10.1 should be applied.

X = ÀôŒ≥(s) at the point Œ≥(s). In this sense, the derivation determined by a tensor
Ô¨Åeld of type (1, 1) can be called (generalized) Frenet-Serret derivation along vector
Ô¨Åelds; respectively, the restriction to a path of this derivative along the vector Ô¨Åeld
tangent to the path results into the generalized Frenet-Serret derivative along that

Terminology 2: Normal and geodesic frames
We have called normal some special kinds of local bases, frames, charts, and coor-
dinates investigated in the present book. This needs some explanations which are
given below.
For symmetric linear connections, the local coordinates in which their com-
ponents vanish at a given point are called normal in [70, Chapter V, Section 3]
or in [20, ¬ß 11.6]. In [11, Chapter III, ¬ß 8] and in [71, p. 278] the local coor-
dinates normal at a point, introduced there via the exponential mapping (see
Subsection II.2.3) for linear connection (symmetric or not), are deÔ¨Åned as such
for which the symmetric part of the connection‚Äôs components vanish at that point
(see Proposition II.2.3). Evidently, the latter deÔ¨Ånition includes the former one
as a special case. Note that the both deÔ¨Ånitions originate from the consideration
of the equation (I.3.22) of geodesic paths [11, 70, 71]. This is the primary reason
for calling these local coordinates geodesic (or Riemannian, or normal Rieman-
nian [20, ¬ß 11.5]) in the special case of a Riemannian manifold [51, ¬ß 42, p. 201],
where they are (sometimes) equivalently introduced via the condition that in them
the partial derivatives of the metric‚Äôs components vanish at a given point [51, ¬ß 42]
(cf. Proposition I.6.1).
The case of a symmetric linear connection is investigated in [19, Chapter III,
¬ß 7, pp. 156‚Äì158] (see the references therein too). There is made a distinction
between geodesic and normal at a point local coordinates. Geodesic coordinates
are called the ones in which the connection‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écients vanish at that point

210
Chapter III. Normal Frames on Manifolds
and normal coordinates are called the geodesic ones satisfying at the given point
equation (7.23) of [19, Chapter III, ¬ß 7] which, in particular, implies the van-
ishment at that point of the connection‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écients together with their sym-
metrized partial derivatives.1 (Note that the possibility for the existence of the
last type of coordinates is ensured by our (non-)uniqueness result expressed by
Proposition I.5.2 with which is compatible the mentioned equation; see also equa-
tions (I.6.11) and (II.3.10) and Proposition II.2.3.) Analogous opinion is shared
in [99, pp. 13‚Äì14].
It is known that the symmetric parts of the connection coeÔ¨Écients of arbi-
trary linear connection ‚àáare directly linked with the equation (I.3.22) of geodesic
lines (curves, paths) and uniquely determine them [11, 19]. By our opinion, this
suggests the following convenient convention. Call normal or respectively geodesic
on a set U a local coordinate system (chart, frame), deÔ¨Åned in a neighborhood of U,
in which the local components of ‚àáor respectively their symmetric parts vanish
on U. Thus, in the torsion free case, the concepts of normal and geodesic coordi-
nate system coincide. Generally a normal frame is geodesic, the converse being not
valid. In this sense, the normal coordinates described in [19, p. 158] are a special
type of (our) normal coordinates, speciÔ¨Åed by the additional conditions described
in this reference. These conditions are consistent with Proposition I.5.2. Note that
the proposed deÔ¨Ånition is in accordance with the special one used in [100].
If one adopts the suggested convention, then the generalization from linear
connections to arbitrary derivations D (along vector Ô¨Åelds, Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, paths,
Ô¨Åxed path) of the tensor algebra over a manifold is evident: only the concept of
a normal frame is applicable because, generally, of some symmetry properties of
the components of D cannot be spoken about.2 This explains the terminology
accepted in the present monograph.
Let us mention that the so-deÔ¨Åned normal frames on U for D have a con-
nection with a kind of generalized geodesic paths corresponding to D (cf. [101])
which will be discussed brieÔ¨Çy in Section IV.15.

Conclusion
As the title of the present chapter indicates, it deals with diÔ¨Äerent kinds of prob-
lems concerning frames (coordinates, charts) normal for derivations (along vector
Ô¨Åelds, Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, paths, Ô¨Åxed path) of the tensor algebra over (vector Ô¨Åelds
on) a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. Excluding the cases along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld or Ô¨Åxed
path, the general conclusion is that a derivation admits frames normal on some set
if and only if on it the derivation coincides with some linear connection (with the
1Cf. the derived here similar equations (I.6.11) and (II.3.10) for respectively the Riemannian
coordinates and Fermi coordinates.
2If D is derivation along arbitrary vector Ô¨Åelds or paths and it admits frames normal on U,
then one can speak of the symmetry properties of the coeÔ¨Écients of D on U as D is linear on U
(Proposition 3.1).

same coeÔ¨Écients as the derivation on the set given) for which normal frames exist.
This fact singles out the linear connections, deÔ¨Åned locally or globally, as the only
derivations which admit normal frames in the above sense. The last conclusion
is important for the theoretical physics and explains to a great extent why the
linear connections Ô¨Ånd so many applications in it. The reason is, from certain po-
sitions, quite simple: due to the equivalence principle, the ‚Äònormal frames‚Äô are the
mathematical concept for describing the physical notion of ‚Äòinertial frame‚Äô [97].
Most of the material in this chapter is new and written for the present book.
Exceptions are some results in Sections 4‚Äì7 which are taken from [76,80,83],1 but
the proofs are completely revised or new.
The main results obtained can be summarized as follows: Necessary and suf-
Ô¨Åcient conditions for the existence of frames or coordinates normal at a single
point, along locally injective paths or, more generally, mappings, and on subman-
ifolds for derivations along either arbitrary or Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld or path are found.
Frames normal at a single point or along a path always exist. On other sets normal
frames exist iÔ¨Äsome additional conditions are satisÔ¨Åed, exception being the case
of a derivation along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, when normal frames exist on every subset
of the manifold or, in particular, on the whole manifold. When normal frames or
coordinates exist, their complete constructive description is given.2
1These papers are revised journal versions of the earlier works [84‚Äì86], respectively.
2Exceptions are some cases of a derivation along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, in which complicated
systems of partial diÔ¨Äerential equations arise.

ces are the identity one. A number of results, including
theorems of existence and uniqueness, concerning normal
frames are derived. Special attention is paid to the case
when the bundle‚Äôs base is a manifold. The normal frames
are deÔ¨Åned and investigated also for derivations along
paths and along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds in the last
case. Frames normal at a single point or along
a given path always exist. On other subsets
normal frames exist only in the curva-
ture free case. The privileged role
of the parallel transports is
pointed out in this
context.

Introduction
The analysis of Corollary II.5.1 on page 123 reveals that the properties of the
parallel transport assigned to a linear connection, not directly the ones of the con-
nection itself, are responsible for the existence of frames normal on a submanifold
for the connection.1 This observation forms the groundwork of the idea the ‚Äònor-
mal‚Äô frames to be deÔ¨Åned directly for (parallel) transports without referring to the
concept of a (linear) connection (or some other derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds). The
main obstacle for the realization of such an approach to ‚Äònormal frames‚Äô is that,
ordinary, the concept of a parallel transport is a secondary one, it is introduced
on the base of the concept of a (linear) connection. To the solution of the last
problem and the development of the mentioned approach to normal frames (in
Ô¨Ånite-dimensional vector bundles) is devoted the present chapter of the book. As
we shall demonstrate below, the consistent realization of the above idea leads to
a completely new look on the ‚Äònormal frames‚Äô, which is self-contained and incor-
porates as special cases all of the results of the preceding chapters.
The material in Sections 3‚Äì6 and 8 is based on the work [102] and the one
after them is practically new and written especially for the present book.2
In the present chapter is studied a wide range of problems concerning frames
normal for linear transports and derivations along paths in vector bundles and
for derivations along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds in the case when the bundle‚Äôs base is
a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. In the last case, when tangent bundles are concerned,
the only general result, known to the author and regarding normal frames, is [23,
p. 102, Theorem 2.106].
The structure of this chapter is as follows.
Section 2 introduces some basic concepts from the theory of (Ô¨Åbre) bundles, in
particular of the one of vector bundles, required for the investigations in this chap-
ter. After the concepts of bundle, section, and vector bundle are Ô¨Åxed, a special at-
tention to the ones of liftings of paths and derivations along paths, which will play
an important role further, is paid. The tensor bundles over a manifold are pointed
as particular examples of vector bundles. Details on these and many other concepts
regarding (Ô¨Åbre) bundles, the reader can Ô¨Åned in the monographs [7,11,106‚Äì110].
Section 3 is devoted to the general theory of linear transports along paths in
vector Ô¨Åbre bundles which is a far reaching generalization of the theory of parallel
transports generated by linear connections.3 The general form and other prop-
erties of these transports are studied. A bijective correspondence between them
and derivations along paths is established. In Section 4, the normal frames are de-
1Here the situation is similar to the one described in the second paragraph of Section II.1
on page 74: the properties of the ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols, not directly the ones of the Riemannian
metric generating them, are fully responsible for the existence of coordinates normal at a single
point in a Riemannian manifold.
2Although, some initial ideas and results are borrowed from the papers [103‚Äì105].
3This section is based on the early works [101, 105, 111‚Äì115] of the author. For some more
general results, see Chapter V.

Ô¨Åned as ones in which the matrix of a linear transport along paths is the identity
(unit) one or, equivalently, in which its coeÔ¨Écients, as deÔ¨Åned in Section 3, vanish
‚Äòlocally‚Äô. A number of properties of the normal frames are found. In Section 5 is
explored the problem of existence of normal frames. Several necessary and suf-
Ô¨Åcient conditions for such existence are proved and the explicit construction of
normal frames, if any, is presented.
Section 6 concentrates on, possibly, the most important special case of frames
normal for linear transports or derivations along smooth paths in vector bundles
with a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold as a base. A speciÔ¨Åc necessary and suÔ¨Écient condi-
tion for existence of normal frames in that case is proved. In particular, normal
frames may exist only for those linear transports or derivations along paths whose
(2‚Äìindex) coeÔ¨Écients linearly depend on the vector tangent to the path along
which they act. Obviously, this is a generalization of the derivation along curves
assigned to a linear connection. Section 7 exampliÔ¨Åes the theory in a case of line
bundles. Section 8 is devoted to problems concerning frames normal for derivations
along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds in a bundle with a manifold as a base. Necessary and
suÔ¨Écient conditions for the existence of these frames are derived. The conclusion
is made that there is a one-to-one onto correspondence between the sets of lin-
ear transports along paths, derivations along paths, and derivations along tangent
vector Ô¨Åelds all of which admit normal frames.
In the Ô¨Årst part of Section 9, based on [103], the concept of a curvature of a
linear transport along paths is introduced and some its properties are explored. In
its second part, relations between the curvature of a linear transports along paths
and the frames normal for them are studied. The main result is that only the cur-
vature free transports admit normal frames. The concept of a torsion of a linear
transport along paths in the tangent bundle over a manifold is introduced in Sec-
tion 10 (cf. the early paper [103]). Links between the torsion and holonomic normal
frames are investigated. The vanishment of the torsion is pointed as a necessary
and suÔ¨Écient condition for existence of normal coordinates on submanifolds. If
such coordinates exist, their complete description is given.
Section 11 deals with parallel transports in the tangent bundles over mani-
folds and frames normal for these transports. It is shown that the parallel transport
assigned to a linear connection is a special kind of a linear transport in tangent
bundles. As a side result, an axiomatic deÔ¨Ånition of a parallel transport is ob-
tained, on the base of which a new deÔ¨Ånition of a linear connection, equivalent to
the usual one, is given. The Ô¨Çat parallel transports are pointed as the only linear
transports along paths in tangent bundles which transports admit normal frames.
The coordinates normal for Ô¨Çat and torsionless parallel transports are explicitly
presented.
Section 12 concerns a special type of normal frames in which the 3-index
coeÔ¨Écients, if any, of a linear transport along paths vanish.
Section 13 is similar to Section 11, but it deals with the interrelations between
diÔ¨Äerent types of derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds over a manifold and the linear

216
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
transports along paths in the tangent bundle over it. As examples, particular
derivations or transports, such as Fermi-Walker, Jaumann, etc., are considered.
The aim of Section 14 is twofold. On one hand (Subsections 14.1‚Äì14.3), the
rigorous relations between the theory of linear transports along paths in vector
bundles and the one of parallel transports and connections in these bundles are
investigated. On the base of the axiomatic approach to the theory of parallel
transports, as presented in [23], we show how it (and hence the one of connections)
is incorporated as a special case in the general theory of linear transports along
paths. On another hand (Subsections 14.4 and 14.5), we demonstrate how the
results concerning normal frames and derived for linear connections on manifolds
and linear transports along paths are almost in extenso applicable to the theory
of parallel transports and connections on vector bundles.
In Section 15 is introduced the notion of autoparallel paths in manifolds
whose tangent bundle is endowed with a linear transport along paths. If this
transport is a parallel one, it is proved that the autoparallels coincide with the
geodesics of the linear connection generating the transport.
Section 16 gives an idea of the role of the linear transports along paths and
normal frames in a Ô¨Åbre bundle formulation of quantum mechanics.
The chapter ends with some notes in Section 17.
All Ô¨Åbre bundles in this chapter are vectorial ones. The base and total bundle
space of such bundles can be general topological spaces. However, if some kind of
diÔ¨Äerentiation in one/both of these spaces is needed to be introduced (considered),
it/they should possess a smooth structure; if this is the case, we require it/they
to be smooth, of class C1, diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold(s). Starting from Section 6,
the base and total bundle space are supposed to be C1 manifolds. Sections 3‚Äì5
do not depend on the existence of a smoothness structure in the bundle‚Äôs base.
Smoothness of the bundle space is partially required in Sections 2‚Äì5.4
2.
Vector bundles
The purpose of the present section is the introduction of some simple basic concepts
of the theory of (Ô¨Åbre) bundles, in particular of vector bundles, on which this
chapter rests.
The most general intuitive idea of a bundle is the one of an object consisting
of a set (space) to each point of which is ‚Äòattached‚Äô some other set (space). Hence
a bundle should be thought as a mapping whose values are some sets, the attached
sets. On the sets forming a bundle may be imposed a large number of ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô
conditions whose goal is particular bundles to be obtained for the exploration of
more or less concrete problems; for instance, the sets can be topological spaces, in

particular manifolds. Often the attached sets are vector (linear) spaces, in which
case the bundle is called vector bundle. For quite a big class of problems, the notion
of a ‚Äòsmooth‚Äô bundle is required: the idea is when one ‚Äòmoves‚Äô in the initial set,
the corresponding attached sets (or selected points in them) to change smoothly.
A particular example of a smooth vector bundle is the tangent bundle to a
manifold M: its basic set (space) is the manifold M itself and the set attached at
p ‚ààM is the space Tp(M) tangent to M at p. Similar structure have the tensor
bundles of diÔ¨Äerent types over M. If f : M ‚ÜíK is a smooth function, a completely
trivial smooth bundle structure over M arises by assigning to each p ‚ààM the value
f(p) of f at p.
2.1.
Basic deÔ¨Ånitions
A bundle is a triple (E, œÄ, B) of sets E and B, called (total) bundle space and
base (space) respectively, and (generally) surjective mapping œÄ: E ‚ÜíB, called
projection.1 For every b ‚ààB, the set œÄ‚àí1(b) is called the Ô¨Åbre over b.
If X ‚äÜB, the bundle (E, œÄ, B)|X := (œÄ‚àí1(X), œÄ|œÄ‚àí1(X), X) is called the
restriction to X of a bundle (E, œÄ, B).
A section of the bundle (E, œÄ, B) is a mapping œÉ: B ‚ÜíE such that œÄ ‚ó¶œÉ =
idB, i.e., œÉ: b ‚ÜíœÉ(b) ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(b). The set of sections of (E, œÄ, B) is denoted by
Sec(E, œÄ, B).
If E and B are topological spaces, which is the most widely considered case,
the bundle (E, œÄ, B) is called topological. In this case in the deÔ¨Ånition of a bundle
is included the bundle property: there exists a (topological) space E such that, for
each b ‚ààB, there is an open set (‚Äòdirectory space‚Äô) W ‚àãb in B and homeomor-
phism (‚Äòdecomposition function‚Äô) œÜW : W √ó E ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(W) of W √ó E onto œÄ‚àí1(W)
satisfying the condition (œÄ ‚ó¶œÜW )(w, e) = w for w ‚ààW and e ‚ààE. Besides, if
the restriction œÜW |b : {b} √ó E ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(b), b ‚ààB, is homeomorphism, the bundle
property is called local triviality, E is called (typical, standard) Ô¨Åbre of the bundle,
and the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(b) is homeomorphic to E for every b ‚ààB.
A vector bundle is a locally trivial bundle (E, œÄ, B) such that: (i) the Ô¨Åbres
œÄ‚àí1(b), b ‚ààB, and the standard Ô¨Åbre E are (linearly) isomorphic vector spaces
and (ii) the decomposition mappings œÜW and their restrictions œÜW |b are (linear)
isomorphisms between vector spaces. The dimension of E, dim E = dim œÄ‚àí1(b) for
all b ‚ààB, is called the (Ô¨Åbre) dimension of the vector bundle, resp. it is called
(dim E)-dimensional. Here the vector spaces are considered over the Ô¨Åeld K = R, C.
All bundles in this chapter are supposed to be vectorial.
1The notation (E, œÄ, B) for a bundle comes from the one E

‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚ÜíB for a mapping œÄ from
E on B.

Liftings of paths
A lifting2 (in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, B)) of a mapping g: X ‚ÜíB to E, X being
a set, is a mapping g: X ‚ÜíE such that œÄ ‚ó¶g = g. The set of all liftings of a
mapping g: X ‚ÜíB will be denoted by Liftg(E, œÄ, B) := {g: X ‚ÜíE|œÄ‚ó¶g = g}. In
particular, the liftings of the identity mapping idB of the base B are called sections
and their set is Sec(E, œÄ, B) := LiftidB(E, œÄ, B) = {œÉ|œÉ: B ‚ÜíE, œÄ ‚ó¶œÉ = idB}
(see Subsection 2.1).
Let P(A) := {Œ≥|Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíA} and PLift(E, œÄ, B) := {Œª|Œª: P(B) ‚ÜíP(E), (œÄ ‚ó¶
Œª)(Œ≥) = Œ≥ for Œ≥ ‚ààP(B)} be respectively the set of paths in a set A and the set of
liftings of paths from B to E.3 The set PLift(E, œÄ, B) is: (i) A natural K-vector
space if we put (aŒª + b¬µ): Œ≥ ‚ÜíaŒªŒ≥ + b¬µŒ≥ for a, b ‚ààK, Œª, ¬µ ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, B), and
Œ≥ ‚ààP(B), where, for brevity, we write ŒªŒ≥ for Œª(Œ≥), Œª: Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥; (ii) A natural
left module with respect to K-valued functions on B: if f, g: B ‚ÜíK, we deÔ¨Åne
(fŒª + g¬µ): Œ≥ ‚Üí(fŒª)Œ≥ + (g¬µ)Œ≥ with (fŒª)Œ≥(s) := f(Œ≥(s))ŒªŒ≥(s) for Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB and
s ‚ààJ; (iii) A left module with respect to the set PF(B) := {œï|œï: Œ≥ ‚ÜíœïŒ≥, Œ≥ : J ‚Üí
B, œïŒ≥ : J ‚ÜíK} of functions along paths in the base B: for œï, œà ‚ààPF(B), we set
(œïŒª + œà¬µ): Œ≥ ‚Üí(œïŒª)Œ≥ + (œà¬µ)Œ≥ where (œïŒª)Œ≥(s) := (œïŒ≥ŒªŒ≥)(s) := œïŒ≥(s)ŒªŒ≥(s).
If we consider PLift(E, œÄ, B) as a K-vector space, its dimension is equal to
inÔ¨Ånity. If we regard PLift(E, œÄ, B) as a left PF(B)-module, its rank is equal to
the dimension of (E, œÄ, B) (i.e., to the dimension of the Ô¨Åbre(s) of (E, œÄ, B)). In
the last case, a basis in PLift(E, œÄ, B) can be constructed as follows (cf. [116,
Proposition 2.1.14] in a case of sections of a vector bundle).
For every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB and a point s ‚ààJ, choose a basis {ei(s; Œ≥)|i =
1, . . . , dim œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s))} in the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)); if the total space E is a Cr manifold,
we suppose ei(s; Œ≥) to have a Cr dependence on s. DeÔ¨Åne liftings along paths
ÀÜei ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, B) by ÀÜei : Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜei|Œ≥ := ei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥), i.e., ÀÜei|Œ≥ : s ‚ÜíÀÜei|Œ≥(s) := ei(s; Œ≥).
The set {ÀÜei} is a basis in PLift(E, œÄ, B), i.e., for every Œª ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, B) there
are Œªi ‚ààPF(B) such that Œª = 
i ŒªiÀÜei and {ÀÜei} are PF(B)-linearly independent.
Actually, for any path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB and number s ‚ààJ, we have ŒªŒ≥(s) ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)),
so there exists numbers Œªi
Œ≥(s) ‚ààK such that ŒªŒ≥(s) = 
i Œªi
Œ≥(s)ei(s; Œ≥). DeÔ¨Åning
Œªi ‚ààPF(B) by Œªi : Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒªi
Œ≥ with Œªi
Œ≥ : s ‚ÜíŒªi
Œ≥(s), we get Œª = 
i ŒªiÀÜei; if ei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥)
is of class Cr, so are Œªi
Œ≥. The PF(B)-linear independence of {ÀÜei} is an evident
corollary of the K-linear independence of {ei(s; Œ≥)}. As we notice above, if E is
Cr manifold, we choose ÀÜei, i.e., ÀÜei|Œ≥, to be Cr and, consequently, the components
Œªi, i.e., Œªi
Œ≥, are of class Cr too.
Let (E, œÄ, B) be a vector bundle of dimension n ‚ààN, n < ‚àû, U ‚äÜB,
and g: Q ‚ÜíB with Q Ã∏= ‚àÖ. A frame on (over) U (resp. along g) is a set
{ei|i = 1, . . . , n} of n F(U)-linearly (resp. F(g(Q))-linearly) independent sections
of (E, œÄ, B)|U (resp. of (E, œÄ, B)|g(Q)), where F(U) := {f : f : U ‚ÜíK} is the
2For detail see, e.g., [108].
3Every linear transport L along paths (vide infra Section 3, in particular DeÔ¨Ånition 3.3)
provides a lifting of paths: for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB Ô¨Åx some s ‚ààJ and u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)), the mapping
Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒ≥s;u with Œ≥s;u(t) := LŒ≥

p ‚ààg(Q)), the set of vectors {ei|p} is a basis in œÄ‚àí1(p).
2.3.
Derivations along paths
Let (E, œÄ, B) be a vector bundle whose bundle space E is Cr, r ‚ààN, manifold. A
lifting Œª ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, B) is said to be of class Ck, k = 0, 1, . . ., r, if in some (and
hence in any) Ck frame in PLift(E, œÄ, B) its components are of class Ck along
paths in some set of paths, i.e., Œª is of class Ck if ŒªŒ≥ is a Ck path for a path Œ≥
in that set. Obviously, not every path in B has a Ck lifting in E; for instance, all
liftings of a discontinuous path in B are discontinuous paths in E. The set of paths
in B having Ck liftings in E is œÄ ‚ó¶Pk(E) := {œÄ ‚ó¶Œ≥|Œ≥ ‚ààPk(E)}, with Pk(E) being
the set of Ck paths in E. Therefore, when talking of Ck liftings, we shall implicitly
assume that they are acting on paths in œÄ ‚ó¶Pk(E) ‚äÇP(B). The discontinuous
paths in B are, of course, not in œÄ ‚ó¶Pk(E), so that they are excluded from the
considerations below.
Analogously, œï ‚ààPF(B) is of class Ck if œïŒ≥ is of class Ck for a path Œ≥ in
some set of paths. Denote by PLiftk(E, œÄ, B), k = 0, 1, . . ., r, the set of Ck liftings
of paths from B to E and by PFk(B), k = 0, 1, . . ., r, the set of Ck functions along
paths in B.
If the base B is Cr‚Ä≤, r‚Ä≤ ‚ààN, manifold, we denote by Seck(E, œÄ, B), k =
0, 1, . . . , r‚Ä≤, the set of Ck sections of the bundle (E, œÄ, B).
DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1. A derivation along paths in (E, œÄ, B) or a derivation of liftings of
paths in (E, œÄ, B) is a mapping
D: PLift1(E, œÄ, B) ‚ÜíPLift0(E, œÄ, B)
(2.1a)
which is K-linear,
D(aŒª + b¬µ) = aD(Œª) + bD(¬µ)
(2.2a)
for a, b ‚ààK and Œª, ¬µ ‚ààPLift1(E, œÄ, B), and the mapping
DŒ≥
s : PLift1(E, œÄ, B) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)),

deÔ¨Åned via DŒ≥

(D(Œª))(Œ≥)

s (fŒª) = dfŒ≥(s)
ds
ŒªŒ≥(s) + fŒ≥(s)DŒ≥

(2.1c)
deÔ¨Åned by DŒ≥(Œª) := (D(Œª))|Œ≥ = (DŒª)Œ≥, is called a derivation along Œ≥.

220
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Let {ei} be a frame along paths Œ≥, i.e., for any Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB and s ‚ààJ,
ei : (s; Œ≥) ‚Üíei(s; Œ≥) and {ei(s; Œ≥)} is a basis in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) that can depend on s
and Œ≥. The components4 Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) of a derivation D along paths (along Œ≥ at s in
{ei}) are deÔ¨Åned via the expansion
DŒ≥
s ÀÜej =: Œìi
j(s; Œ≥)ei(s; Œ≥),
(2.3)
where ÀÜei : Œ≥ ‚Üíei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥) is a lifting of paths, generated by ei according to (2.8)
below, and the dimension of (E, œÄ, B) is assumed to be Ô¨Ånite. If Œª ‚ààPLift1(E, œÄ, B)
has an expansion Œª = ŒªiÀÜei, then the properties (2.2) imply the explicit local
expansion
DŒ≥
s Œª =

i
dŒªi
Œ≥(s)
ds
+ Œìi
j(s; Œ≥)Œªj
Œ≥(s)

ej(s; Œ≥).
(2.4)
Hence the components of D in a given frame uniquely deÔ¨Åne it.
From the last equation, we get the explicit expansion for DŒª:
D(Œª) = ( ÀôŒªi + Œìi
jŒªj)ÀÜei
(2.5)
where ÀôŒªi, Œìi
j ‚ààPF(B) and ÀÜei ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, B) are such that
ÀôŒªi : Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀôŒªi
Œ≥ : s ‚ÜídŒªi
Œ≥(s)
ds
(2.6)
Œìi
j : Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒìi
j( ¬∑ ; Œ≥): s ‚ÜíŒìi
j(s; Œ≥)
(2.7)
ÀÜei : Œ≥ ‚Üíei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥): s ‚Üíei(s; Œ≥).
(2.8)
Similarly, the derivation of Œª along Œ≥ is
DŒ≥(Œª) := (DŒª)(Œ≥) = ( ÀôŒªi
Œ≥ + Œìi
j( ¬∑ ; Œ≥)Œªj
Œ≥)ei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥).
(2.9)
If the frame {ei} is changed by means of a non-degenerate matrix-valued
function A = [Aj
i], {ei(s; Œ≥)} ‚Üí{e‚Ä≤
i(s; Œ≥) = Aj
i(s; Œ≥)ej(s; Œ≥)}, from (2.3) and (2.2),
we see that the matrix Œì(s; Œ≥) := [Œìi
j(s; Œ≥)] of D transform into
Œì‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) := [Œì‚Ä≤ i
j(s; Œ≥)] = A‚àí1(s; Œ≥)Œì(s; Œ≥)A(s; Œ≥) + A‚àí1(s; Œ≥)dA(s; Œ≥)
ds
.
(2.10)
Applying (2.3), one can easily prove that every system Œìi
j ‚ààPF(B) of func-
tions along paths, Œìi
j : Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒìi
j( ¬∑ ; Œ≥): s ‚ÜíŒìi
j(s; Œ≥), which transform according
to (2.10), deÔ¨Ånes via (2.4) a derivation D along paths in (E, œÄ, B). Combining this
result with the above one, we can assert the existence of a bijective correspondence
4In connection with the theory of normal frames (see Section 4 and further), it is convenient to
call Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) also (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients of DŒ≥. This agrees with the fact that Œìi
j are coeÔ¨Écients
of some linear transport along paths (see below).

2. Vector bundles
221
between the set of functions {Œìi
j} along paths with transformation law (2.10) and
the set of derivations along paths of a vector bundle (E, œÄ, B).
The set PSec(E, œÄ, B) of sections along paths of a bundle (E, œÄ, B) con-
sists of mappings œÉ: Œ≥ ‚ÜíœÉŒ≥ assigning to every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB a section
œÉŒ≥ ‚ààSec

(E, œÄ, B)|Œ≥(J)

of the bundle restricted to Œ≥(J). Every (ordinary) section
œÉ ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, B) generates a section œÉ along paths via œÉ: Œ≥ ‚ÜíœÉŒ≥ := œÉ|Œ≥(J), i.e.,
œÉŒ≥ is simply the restriction of œÉ to Œ≥(J); hence œÉŒ± = œÉŒ≥ for every path Œ±: JŒ± ‚ÜíB
with Œ±(JŒ±) = Œ≥(J). Every œÉ ‚ààPSec(E, œÄ, B) generates a lifting ÀÜœÉ ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, B)
by ÀÜœÉ : Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜœÉŒ≥ := œÉŒ≥ ‚ó¶Œ≥; in particular, the lifting ÀÜœÉ associated to œÉ ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, B)
is given via ÀÜœÉ : Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜœÉŒ≥ = œÉ|Œ≥(J) ‚ó¶Œ≥.
If B is a manifold, every derivation D along paths generates a mapping
D: PSec1(E, œÄ, B) ‚ÜíPLift0(E, œÄ, B)
such that, if œÉ ‚ààPSec1(E, œÄ, B), then D: œÉ ‚ÜíDœÉ = D(œÉ) where DœÉ: Œ≥ ‚ÜíD
Œ≥œÉ
is a lifting of paths deÔ¨Åned by D
Œ≥œÉ: s ‚Üí(D
Œ≥œÉ)(s) := DŒ≥
s ÀÜœÉ with ÀÜœÉ being the
lifting generated by œÉ, i.e., Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜœÉŒ≥ := œÉŒ≥ ‚ó¶Œ≥. The mapping D may be called
a derivation of C1 sections along paths. Notice, if Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB has intersection
points and x0 ‚ààŒ≥(J) is such a point, the mapping Œ≥(J) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(J)) given by
x ‚Üí{DŒ≥
s (ÀÜœÉ)|Œ≥(s) = x, s ‚ààJ}, x ‚ààŒ≥(J), is generally multiple-valued at x0 and,
consequently, is not a section of (E, œÄ, B)|Œ≥(J).
If B is a C1 manifold and for some Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB there exists a subinterval
J‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ on which the restricted path Œ≥|J : J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíB is without self-intersections, i.e.,
Œ≥(s) Ã∏= Œ≥(t) for s, t ‚ààJ‚Ä≤ and s Ã∏= t, we can deÔ¨Åne the derivation along Œ≥ of sections
over Œ≥(J‚Ä≤) as a mapping
DŒ≥ : Sec1
(E, œÄ, B)|Œ≥(J‚Ä≤)

‚ÜíSec0
(E, œÄ, B)|Œ≥(J‚Ä≤)

(2.11)
such that
(DŒ≥œÉ)(x) := DŒ≥
s ÀÜœÉ
for x = Œ≥(s)
(2.12)
where s ‚ààJ‚Ä≤ is unique for a given x ‚ààŒ≥(J‚Ä≤) and ÀÜœÉ ‚ààPLift

(E, œÄ, B)|Œ≥(J‚Ä≤)

is given by ÀÜœÉ = œÉ|Œ≥(J‚Ä≤) ‚ó¶Œ≥|J‚Ä≤. Generally the mapping (2.11) deÔ¨Åned by (2.12)
is multiple-valued at the points of self-intersections of Œ≥, if any, as (DŒ≥œÉ)(x) :=
{DŒ≥
s ÀÜœÉ : s ‚ààJ, Œ≥(s) = x}. The so-deÔ¨Åned mapping D: Œ≥ ‚ÜíDŒ≥ is called a section-
derivation along paths.5 As we said, it is single-valued only along paths without
self-intersections.
Let D be a derivation along paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, B), Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB
be injective, D be the generated by D section-derivation along paths, and œÉ ‚àà
Sec1(E, œÄ, B)|Œ≥(J). As a consequence of (2.12) and (2.4), we have
(DŒ≥œÉ)|Œ≥(s) =

j(s; Œ≥)œÉj(Œ≥(s))

5A particular example of a section-derivation along injective C1 paths is the derivation along
paths provided by DeÔ¨Ånition III.10.1. For details ‚Äì see Remark III.10.1 and Subsection 13.1.

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
where {ei(s; Œ≥)} is a basis in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)), œÉ(Œ≥(s)) =: œÉi(Œ≥(s))ei(s; Œ≥), and Œìi
j(s; Œ≥)
are the components of D (or of D) in {ei}.
Generally a section along paths or lifting of paths does not deÔ¨Åne a (single-
valued) section of the bundle as well as to a lifting along paths there does not
correspond some (single-valued) section along paths. The last case admits one
important special exception, viz. if a lifting Œª is such that the lifted path ŒªŒ≥ is
an ‚Äòexact topological copy‚Äô of the underlying path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB, i.e., if there exist
s, t ‚ààJ, s Ã∏= t for which Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t), then ŒªŒ≥(s) = ŒªŒ≥(t), which means that if
Œ≥ has intersection points, then the lifting ŒªŒ≥ also possesses such points and they
are in the Ô¨Åbres over the corresponding intersection points of Œ≥. Such a lifting
Œª generates a section Œª ‚ààPSec(E, œÄ, B) along paths given by Œª: Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥ with
Œª: Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥(s). In the general case, the mapping Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥(s) for a lifting Œª of
paths is multiple-valued at the points of self-intersection of Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB, if any; for
injective path Œ≥, this mapping is a section of (E, œÄ, B)|Œ≥(J). Such mappings will
be called multiple-valued sections along paths.
2.4.
Tensor bundles
Over every diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold M exists a collection of natural bundles, viz. the
diÔ¨Äerent tensor bundles with M as a base, uniquely related to the diÔ¨Äerentiable
structure of M.
The tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M), called also bundle tangent to M, is a well
explored example of a tensor bundle over a manifold M. Its base is the manifold M
itself, the bundle space T (M) is the disjoint union of the spaces tangent to M (see
Subsection I.2.3), i.e., T (M) := 
p‚ààM Tp(M), and the projection œÄ: T (M) ‚ÜíM
is deÔ¨Åned by œÄ(Xp) := p if Xp ‚ààTp(M). So the Ô¨Åbre of (T (M), œÄ, M) over p ‚ààM
is exactly the space tangent to M at p, œÄ‚àí1(p) = Tp(M). It is a trivial exercise to
be veriÔ¨Åed the equivalence
X ‚ààX(M) ‚áê‚áíX ‚ààSec(T (M), œÄ, M),
i.e., the vector Ô¨Åelds over a manifold are simply sections of its tangent bundle,
and, consequently,
X(M) = Sec(T (M), œÄ, M).
Respectively, the sections along paths of the tangent bundle are mappings assign-
ing to a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM a vector Ô¨Åeld over Œ≥(J) etc.
Since each space Tp(M) is (dim M)-dimensional vector (linear) space, the tan-
gent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) is (dim M)-dimensional vector bundle for which Kdim M
can be taken as a (standard) Ô¨Åbre.
Similar to the tangent bundle is the cotangent bundle (T ‚àó(M), œÄ‚àó, M) whose
bundle space is T ‚àó(M) := 
p‚ààM T ‚àó
p (M) and the projection œÄ‚àóis such that
œÄ‚àó(œâp) := p if œâp ‚ààT ‚àó
p (M) where T ‚àó
p (M) is the cotangent space to M at p
(see Subsection I.2.4).

2. Vector bundles
223
The tensor bundle (T r
s (M), œÄr
s, M) of type (r, s), r, s ‚ààN ‚à™{0} is a natural
generalization of the tangent and cotangent bundles. Its bundle space is the disjoint
union of the tensor spaces of type (r, s) over M,
T r
s (M) :=
!
p‚ààM
Tp
r
s(M)
with Tp
r
s(M) being the tensor space of type (r, s) at p ‚ààM (see Subsection I.2.5).
The projection œÄr
s : T r
s (M) ‚ÜíM is deÔ¨Åned by
œÄr
s(Kp) := p
for Kp ‚ààTp
r
s(M).
Therefore the dimension of (T r
s (M), œÄr
s, M) is (dim M)r+s = dim Tp
r
s(M) and
K(dim M)r+s can be taken as its standard Ô¨Åbre. The choices (r, s) = (1, 0) and
(r, s) = (0, 1) correspond to the tangent and cotangent bundles, respectively. Since
Tp

0 ‚â°K, the tensor bundle of type (0, 0) is (M √ó K, œÄ0
0, M) with œÄ0
0(p, a) := p for
(p, a) ‚ààM √ó K.
Obviously, the tensor Ô¨Åelds over M are sections of the corresponding tensor
bundles and vice versa,
Tr
s(M) = Sec

T r
s (M), œÄr
s, M

.
The algebraic tensor bundle (T(M), œÄ, M) on (over) a manifold M is also
an example of a bundle structure over manifolds. By deÔ¨Ånition, its bundle space
is the disjoint union of the tensor algebras over M, T := 
p‚ààM T p(M), and its
projection is such that œÄ(Kp) := p if Kp ‚ààT p(M) for p ‚ààM, i.e., the Ô¨Åbre over p
is the tensor algebra at p, œÄ‚àí1(p) = T p(M). All tensor Ô¨Åelds are speciÔ¨Åc (of type
(r, s)) sections of the algebraic tensor bundle.
One can expect the existence of a link between the derivations along vector
Ô¨Åelds of the tensor algebra over M (see DeÔ¨Ånition III.10.1 on page 191) and the
derivations along paths of the tensor bundles over M. Since the former derivations
are (uniquely) deÔ¨Åned only along injective paths, the mentioned connection could
be expressed via the section-derivations along paths of the tensor bundles over the
manifold M (see (2.11) and (2.12)).
Let D be a derivation along paths of T (M), Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be injective, and K
be a C1 tensor Ô¨Åeld(=section) of type (r, q) along Œ≥. Locally, in some frame along
Œ≥, the derivative DŒ≥(K) of K along Œ≥ is given by (III.10.7) in which Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) are
the components of D along Œ≥ at s ‚ààJ.
Let now D be a section-derivation along paths, generated by a derivation
along paths, in the tensor bundle (T r
q (M), œÄr
q, M). If K ‚ààTr
q(M), then, in the
tensor frame (I.2.41) induced by a frame {Ei}, equation (2.13), with K for œÉ and

(2.14)
This expression is identical for every K with the one corresponding to the right-
hand side of (III.10.7) if and only if the components of the section-derivation D
have the form
Œìi1,...,ir,k1,...,kq
j1,...,iq,l1,...,lr (s; Œ≥) =

where Œìi
l are the components of a (section-)derivation along paths in the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M).
Thus we have proved that a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds of the tensor algebra
over a manifold M is equivalent to a set of (section-)derivations along paths, one
in each tensor bundle (T r
q (M), œÄr
q, M) with q, r ‚ààN‚à™{0}, whose components have
in some (and hence in every) frame the form (2.15); the corresponding (section-)
derivation along paths in (T r
q (M), œÄr
q, M) being equal to the restriction of the
initial derivation along paths of T (M) to the bundle space T r
q (M) of the tensor
bundle of type (r, q).
Example 2.1. A particular example of the above derivations is provided by the one
generated by a linear connection ‚àáover M. As we said earlier in Section III.10,
any linear connection ‚àágenerates along every C1 path Œ≥ a derivation ‚àáÀôŒ≥ along Œ≥
(of the tensor algebra along Œ≥), locally given via (III.10.5). Taking into account the
afore-said, we can assert that in the tensor bundle of type (r, q) every connection
‚àágenerates a derivation along paths with local coeÔ¨Écients (2.15) in which
Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s)
(2.16)
where Œìi
jk are the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àá.
6Notice, for r = q = 0 equation (2.14) implies (DŒ≥K)(Œ≥(s)) = dK(Œ≥(s))
ds
= ÀôŒ≥(s)(K), i.e., on
scalar functions DŒ≥ acts as ordinary directional derivative, as it should be.

Linear transports along paths in vector bundles
In the majority of the mathematical literature, the concept of a connection (in
locally trivial diÔ¨Äerentiable bundles of class C1) is taken as a basic one and the
concept of a parallel transport is introduced by its means (see, e.g., [6,10‚Äì13,16,
28, 106, 117]). However, the opposite approach is also known [17, 23, 30‚Äì33]: in it
the ‚Äòparallel transport‚Äô is axiomatically deÔ¨Åned and on its base the concept of a
‚Äòconnection‚Äô is introduced as a secondary one.1 It seems that the earliest written
accounts on this approach are the ones due to ¬®U.G. Lumiste [30, Section 2.2]
and C. Teleman [17, Chapter IV, Section B.3] (both published in 1964), the next
essential steps being made by P. Dombrowski [31, ¬ß 1] and W. Poor [23].2 The
comparison and the features of the both approaches to the theory of connections
and parallel transports is not a subject of the present book,3 but, for completeness,
it is partially investigated in Section V.8.
In the present section, the concept of a ‚Äòlinear transport along paths in vec-
tor bundles‚Äô is axiomatically deÔ¨Åned and some its simple properties are derived.
This concept is a straightforward generalization of the one of a parallel transport
assigned to a linear connection (see Section 11) and some other transports deÔ¨Åned
on its base (see Section 13). As we shall see later (see DeÔ¨Ånitions 11.2 and 11.3
and the comments after them), on its base independent, but equivalent, deÔ¨Ånition
of a parallel transport and linear connection can be given. Moreover, in Subsec-
tion 14.3 will be shown that the parallel transports in general vector bundles are a
special type of linear transports along paths, as a consequence of which the whole
theory of connections and covariant derivatives can be deduced from the theory
of linear transports in these bundles.
3.1.
DeÔ¨Ånition and general form
Let (E, œÄ, B) be a K-vector bundle4 with bundle (total) space E, base B, projec-
tion œÄ: E ‚ÜíB, and homeomorphic Ô¨Åbres œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààB. Whenever some kind
of diÔ¨Äerentiation in E is considered, the bundle space E will be required to be
a C1 diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. The base B is supposed to be a general topological
space in Sections 3‚Äì5 and from Section 6 onwards is required to be a C1 diÔ¨Äeren-
tiable manifold. By J and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB are denoted a real interval and path in B,
1A summary of the realization of this approach in [23] is presented in Subsection 14.1 below;
see also [118].
2The author of [31] states that his paper is based on unpublished lectures of prof. W. Rinow
in 1949. See also [23, p. 46] where the author claims that the Ô¨Årst axiomatical deÔ¨Ånition of a
parallel transport in the tangent bundle case is given by prof. W. Rinow in his lectures at the
Humboldt University in 1949. Some heuristic comments on the axiomatic approach to parallel
transport theory can be found in [8, Section 2.1] too.
3For some details, see [115,118] and the references given therein.
4Most of our results are valid for vector bundles over more general Ô¨Åelds too but this is
inessential for the following.

226
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
respectively. The paths considered are generally not supposed to be continuous or
diÔ¨Äerentiable unless their diÔ¨Äerentiability class is stated explicitly.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1. A linear transport along paths in the bundle (E, œÄ, B) is a mapping
L assigning to every path Œ≥ a mapping LŒ≥, transport along Œ≥, such that LŒ≥ : (s, t) ‚Üí
LŒ≥
s‚Üít where the mapping
LŒ≥
s‚Üít : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t))
s, t ‚ààJ,
(3.1)
called transport along Œ≥ from s to t, has the properties:

Œª, ¬µ ‚ààK,
u, v ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)).
(3.4)
Remark 3.1. Equations (3.2) and (3.3) mean that L is a transport along paths in
the bundle (E, œÄ, B) (see DeÔ¨Ånition V.8.1 below or [114, DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1]), which
may be an arbitrary topological bundle, not only a vector one in the general
case,5 while (3.4) speciÔ¨Åes that it is linear [114, equation (2.8)]. In the present
book, with an exception of Section V.8, only linear transports in vector bundles
will be explored.
Remark 3.2. DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 is a generalization of the concept of ‚Äòlinear connection‚Äô
given, e.g., in [31, Section 1.2] (see especially [31, p. 138, axiom (L1)]) which prac-
tically deÔ¨Ånes the covariant derivative in terms of linear transports along paths
(see (3.29) below which is equivalent to [31, p. 138, axiom (L3)]). Our deÔ¨Ånition
is much weaker; e.g., we completely drop [31, p. 138, axiom (L3)] and use, if re-
quired, weaker smoothness conditions. An excellent introduction to the theory of
vector bundles and the parallel transports in them can be found in the book [23].
In particular, in this reference is proved the equivalence of the concepts parallel
transport, connection and covariant derivative operator in vector bundles (as de-
Ô¨Åned there). Analogous results concerning linear transports along paths will be
presented below. The detailed comparison of DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 with analogous ones
in the literature is not a subject of this work.
Further, in Subsection 13.3 (see also DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1, [105, DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1]
and [105, Proposition 4.1]), it will be proved that special types of linear trans-
5The deÔ¨Ånition of a connection in a topological bundle (E, œÄ, B) in [17, Chapter IV, Sec-
tion B.3] is, in fact, an axiomatic deÔ¨Ånition of a parallel transport. If we neglect the continuity con-
dition in this deÔ¨Ånition, it deÔ¨Ånes a connection in (E, œÄ, B) as a mapping C : (Œ≥, q) ‚ÜíC(Œ≥, q) as-
signing to any continuous path Œ≥ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíB and a point q ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(0)) a path C(Œ≥, q): [0, 1] ‚ÜíE
such that C(Œ≥, q)|0 = q and œÄ ‚ó¶C(Œ≥, q) = Œ≥. If I is a transport along paths in (E, œÄ, B), then
C : (Œ≥, q) ‚ÜíC(Œ≥, q): t ‚ÜíC(Œ≥, q)|t = IŒ≥
0‚Üít(q) deÔ¨Ånes a connection C in (E, œÄ, B) in the sense
mentioned. Moreover, if this deÔ¨Ånition is broadened by replacing [0, 1] with an arbitrary and
not Ô¨Åxed closed interval [a, b], with a, b ‚ààR and a ‚â§b, then the converse is also true, i.e.,
C(Œ≥, q)|t = IŒ≥
a‚Üít(q), t ‚àà[a, b], for some transport I. However, the proof of this statement is not
trivial; cf. similar considerations in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3 below, which deal with analogous
problems in vector bundles (with other deÔ¨Ånition of a parallel transport).

ports along paths are: the parallel transport assigned to a linear connection (co-
variant derivative) of the tensor algebra of a manifold [11, 19],6 Fermi-Walker
transport [62,119], Fermi transport [62], Truesdell transport [120,121], Jaumann
transport [122], Lie transport [19, 119], the modiÔ¨Åed Fermi-Walker and Frenet-
Serret transports [98], etc. Consequently, DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 is general enough to cover
a list of important transports used in theoretical physics and mathematics. Thus
studying the properties of the linear transports along paths, we can make corre-
sponding conclusions for any one of the transports mentioned.7
From (3.2) and (3.3), we get that LŒ≥
s‚Üít are invertible mappings and
(LŒ≥
s‚Üít)‚àí1 = LŒ≥
t‚Üís,
s, t ‚ààJ.
(3.5)
Hence the linear transports along paths are in fact linear isomorphisms of the
Ô¨Åbres over the path along which they act.
The following two propositions establish the general structure of linear trans-
ports along paths.8
Proposition 3.1. A mapping (3.1) is a linear transport along Œ≥ from s to t for every
s, t ‚ààJ if and only if there exist a vector space V , isomorphic with œÄ‚àí1(x) for
all x ‚ààB, and a family {F(s; Œ≥): œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) ‚ÜíV, s ‚ààJ} of linear isomorphisms
such that
LŒ≥
s‚Üít = F ‚àí1(t; Œ≥) ‚ó¶F(s; Œ≥),
s, t ‚ààJ.
(3.6)
Proof. If (3.1) is a linear transport along Œ≥ from s to t, then Ô¨Åxing some s0 ‚ààJ and
using (3.3) and (3.5), we get LŒ≥
s‚Üít = LŒ≥
s0‚Üít ‚ó¶LŒ≥
s‚Üís0 =

LŒ≥
t‚Üís0
‚àí1 ‚ó¶LŒ≥
s‚Üís0. So (3.6)
holds for V = œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)) and F(s; Œ≥) = LŒ≥
s‚Üís0. Conversely, if (3.6) is valid for
some linear isomorphisms F(s; Œ≥), then a straightforward calculation shows that
it converts (3.2) and (3.3) into identities and (3.4) holds due to the linearity of
F(s; Œ≥).
‚ñ°
Proposition 3.2. Let a representation (3.6) for some vector space V and linear
isomorphisms F(s; Œ≥): œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) ‚ÜíV, s ‚ààJ be given for a linear transport along
paths in the bundle (E, œÄ, B). For a vector space
‚ãÜV , there exist linear isomor-
phisms ‚ãÜF(s; Œ≥): œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) ‚Üí‚ãÜV, s ‚ààJ, for which
LŒ≥
s‚Üít = ‚ãÜF ‚àí1(t; Œ≥) ‚ó¶‚ãÜF(s; Œ≥),
s, t ‚ààJ,
(3.7)
6For the proof, see Proposition 11.1 on page 282 below.
7The concept of linear transport along paths in vector bundles can be generalized to the trans-
ports along paths in arbitrary bundles [114] and to transports along mappings in bundles [123].
An interesting consideration of the concept of (parallel) ‚Äòtransport‚Äô (along closed paths) in con-
nection with homotopy theory and the classiÔ¨Åcation problem of bundles can be found in [124].
These generalizations are out of the scope of the present book.
8Particular examples of Proposition 3.1 are known for parallel transports in vector bundles.
For instance, Proposition 1 in [125, p. 240] realizes it for parallel transport in a bundle associated
to a principal one and induced by a connection in the latter case; see also the proof of the lemma in
the proof of Proposition 1.1 in [11, Chapter III, ¬ß 1], where a similar result is obtained implicitly.

228
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
iÔ¨Äthere exists a linear isomorphism D(Œ≥): V ‚Üí‚ãÜV such that
‚ãÜF(s; Œ≥) = D(Œ≥) ‚ó¶F(s; Œ≥),
s ‚ààJ.
(3.8)
Proof. If equation (3.8) holds, the substitution of F(s; Œ≥) = D‚àí1(Œ≥) ‚ó¶‚ãÜF(s; Œ≥)
into (3.6) yields (3.7). Vice versa, if (3.7) is valid, then from its comparison
with (3.6) follows that D(Œ≥) =
‚ãÜF(t; Œ≥) ‚ó¶

F(t; Œ≥)
‚àí1 =
‚ãÜF(s; Œ≥) ‚ó¶

F(s; Œ≥)
‚àí1
is the required (independent of s, t ‚ààJ) isomorphism.
‚ñ°
Starting from this point, we shall investigate further only the Ô¨Ånite-dimen-
sional case, dim œÄ‚àí1(x) = dim œÄ‚àí1(y) < ‚àûfor all x, y ‚ààB. In this way we shall
avoid a great number of speciÔ¨Åc problems arising when the Ô¨Åbres have inÔ¨Ånite
dimension (see, e.g., [126] for details). A lot of our results are valid, possibly mu-
tatis mutandis, in the inÔ¨Ånite-dimensional treatment too. One way for transferring
results from Ô¨Ånite to inÔ¨Ånite-dimensional spaces is the direct limit from the Ô¨Årst to
the second ones. Then, for instance, if the bundle‚Äôs dimension is countably or un-
countably inÔ¨Ånite, the corresponding sums must be replaced by series or integrals
whose convergence, however, requires special exploration [126]. Linear transports
along paths in inÔ¨Ånite-dimensional vector bundles naturally arise, e.g., in the Ô¨Åbre
bundle formulation of quantum mechanics [127‚Äì131]. Generally, there are many
diÔ¨Éculties with the inÔ¨Ånite-dimensional problem which deserves a separate inves-
tigation.
3.2.
Representations in frames along paths
Let {ei(s; Œ≥)} be a basis in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)), s ‚ààJ.9 So, along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB we have a
set {ei} of bases on œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(J)), i.e., {ei} is a frame along Œ≥.10 The dependence of
ei(s; Œ≥) on s is inessential if we are interested only in the algebraic properties of
the linear transports along paths. The mapping s ‚Üíei(s; Œ≥) will be required to be
of class C1 if some kind of diÔ¨Äerentiation of liftings of paths will be considered.
The matrix L(t, s; Œ≥) :=

We call L: (t, s; Œ≥) ‚ÜíL(t, s; Œ≥) the matrix (function) of L; respectively Lj

are its matrix elements or components in the given frame.
It is almost evident that

9Here and henceforth the Latin indices run from 1 to dim œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààB.
10Regardless of the fact that {ei(s; Œ≥)} is a basis in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)), we write ei(s; Œ≥), not ei(Œ≥(s)),
as we consider ei : Œ≥ ‚Üíei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥) as a lifting of paths; hence ei(s; Œ≥) generally depends on s and
Œ≥, not only on the combination Œ≥(s). If Œ≥ has self-intersections, then the mapping p ‚Üíei(s; Œ≥),
with p ‚ààŒ≥(J) and s ‚ààJ such that p = Œ≥(s), is, generally, multiple-valued at these points.

In terms of the matrix L of L, the basic equations (3.2) and (3.3) read respectively

(3.13)
L(s, s; Œ≥) = 1

with 1 being the identity (unit) matrix of corresponding size. From these equalities
immediately follows that L is always non-degenerate.
Proposition 3.3. A linear mapping (3.1) is a linear transport along Œ≥ from s to t
iÔ¨Äits matrix, deÔ¨Åned via (3.9), satisÔ¨Åes (3.13) and (3.14).
Proof. The necessity was already proved. The suÔ¨Éciency is trivial: a simple check-
ing proves that (3.13) and (3.14) convert respectively (3.2) and (3.3) into identities.

Proposition 3.4. A non-degenerate matrix-valued function L: (t, s; Œ≥) ‚ÜíL(t, s; Œ≥)

along Œ≥) iÔ¨Ä
L(t, s; Œ≥) = F ‚àí1(t; Œ≥)F (s; Œ≥)
(3.15)
where F : (t; Œ≥) ‚ÜíF (t; Œ≥) is a non-degenerate matrix-valued function.
Proof. This proposition is simply a matrix form of Proposition 3.1. If {fi} is a
basis in V and F(s; Œ≥)ei(s; Œ≥) = F j
i(s; Œ≥)fj, then (3.15) with F (s; Œ≥) =

is equivalent to (3.6).

Proposition 3.5. If the matrix L of a linear transport L along paths has a repre-
sentation
L(t, s; Œ≥) = ‚ãÜF ‚àí1(t; Œ≥) ‚ãÜF (s; Œ≥)
(3.16)
for some matrix-valued function ‚ãÜF (s; Œ≥), then all matrix-valued functions F rep-
resenting L via (3.15) are given by
F (s; Œ≥) = D‚àí1(Œ≥) ‚ãÜF (s; Œ≥)
(3.17)
where D(Œ≥) is a non-degenerate matrix depending only on Œ≥.

230
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Proof. In fact, this propositions is a matrix variant of Proposition 3.2; D(Œ≥) is
simply the matrix of the mapping D(Œ≥) in some bases.
‚ñ°
If F (s; Œ≥) and F ‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) are two matrix-valued functions, representing the ma-
trix of L via (3.15) in two bases {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i} respectively, then, as a consequence
of (3.11), the relation
F ‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) = C(Œ≥)F (s; Œ≥)A(s; Œ≥)
(3.18)
holds for some non-degenerate matrix-valued function C of Œ≥.

Linear transports and derivations along paths
Below we want to consider some properties of the linear transports along paths
connected with their ‚ÄòdiÔ¨Äerentiability‚Äô; in particular, we shall establish a bijective
correspondence between them and the derivations along paths. For the purpose is
required a smooth, of class at least C1, transition from Ô¨Åbre to Ô¨Åbre when moving
along a path in the base. Rigorously this is achieved by exploring transports in
bundles whose bundle space is a C1 diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold which will be supposed
from now on in the present chapter.
Let (E, œÄ, B) be a vector bundle whose bundle space E is a Cr, r ‚ààN ‚à™
{0, ‚àû, œâ}, diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. A linear transport LŒ≥ along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB is called
diÔ¨Äerentiable of class Ck, k = 0, 1, . . ., r, or simply Ck transport, if for arbi-

œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t)), t ‚ààJ, is a Ck mapping in the bundle space E. If a Ck linear trans-
port has a representation (3.6), the mapping s ‚ÜíF(s; Œ≥) is of class Ck. So, the
transport LŒ≥ is of class Ck iÔ¨ÄLŒ≥
s‚Üít has Ck dependence on s and t simultaneously.
If {ei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥)} is a Ck frame along Œ≥, i.e., {ei(s; Œ≥)} is a basis in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) and the
mapping s ‚Üíei(s; Œ≥) is of class Ck for all i, from (3.12) follows that LŒ≥ is of class
Ck iÔ¨Äits matrix L(t, s; Œ≥) has Ck dependence on s and t.
Let E be a C1 manifold and S a set of paths in B, S ‚äÜP(B) = {Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB}.
A transport L along paths in (E, œÄ, B), E being Cr manifold, is said to be of class
Ck, k = 0, 1, . . ., r, on S if the corresponding transport LŒ≥ along Œ≥ is of class Ck
for all Œ≥ ‚ààS. A transport along paths may turn to be of class Ck on some set S of
paths in B and not to be of class Ck on other set S‚Ä≤ of paths in B. Below, through
Section 6, the set S will not be specialized and written explicitly; correspondingly,
we shall speak simply of Ck transports implicitly assuming that they are such on
some set S. Starting from Section 6, we shall suppose B to be a C1 manifold and
the set S to be the one of C1 paths in B. Further we consider only C1 linear
transports along paths whose matrices will be referred to smooth frames along
paths.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2. The derivation D along paths generated by a C1 linear transport L
along paths in (E, œÄ, B), E being a C1 manifold, is a mapping of type (2.1a) such

that for every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB, we have DŒ≥ : Œª ‚Üí(DŒª)Œ≥ with DŒ≥Œª: s ‚ÜíDŒ≥

for every lifting Œª ‚ààPLift1(E, œÄ, B) with Œª: Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥. The mapping DŒ≥ (resp. DŒ≥
s )
will be called a derivation along Œ≥ generated by L (resp. a derivation along Œ≥ at s
assigned to L).
Remark 3.3. The operator DŒ≥
s is an analogue of the covariant derivative along
paths assigned to a linear connection; cf., e.g., [31, p. 139, equation (12)].
Remark 3.4. Notice, if Œ≥ has self-intersections and x0 ‚ààŒ≥(J) is such a point, the
mapping x ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(x), x ‚ààŒ≥(J), given by x ‚Üí{DŒ≥
s (Œª)|Œ≥(s) = x, s ‚ààJ} is,
generally, multiple-valued at x0.
Let L be a linear transport along paths in (E, œÄ, B). For every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB,
choose some s0 ‚ààJ and u0 ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)). The mapping

DeÔ¨Ånition 3.3. The lifting of paths L from B to E in (E, œÄ, B), deÔ¨Åned via (3.20),
is called lifting (of paths) generated by the (linear) transport L.

that the lifting L is constant along every path Œ≥ with respect to D.
Let {ei(s; Œ≥)} be a smooth Ô¨Åeld of bases along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB, s ‚ààJ, i.e., {ei} to
be a frame along Œ≥. Combining (3.12) and (3.19), we Ô¨Ånd the explicit local action

Exercise 3.1. Prove that the derivation along paths generated by a linear trans-
port is actually a derivation along paths (see DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1). (Hint: use (3.22)
and (3.23).)
Below, we shall prove that, freely speaking, a linear transport along path(s)
can locally, in a given Ô¨Åeld of local bases, be described equivalently by the set of
its local coeÔ¨Écients (with transformation law (3.26) written below).
If the transport‚Äôs matrix L has a representation (3.15), from (3.24) we get

(3.26)
Proposition 3.6. Let along every (resp. given) path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB be given a geometri-
cal object Œì whose local components Œìi

to (3.26) with Œì(s; Œ≥) =


. There exists a unique linear transport L along
paths (resp. along Œ≥) the matrix of whose coeÔ¨Écients is exactly Œì(s; Œ≥) in {ei}
along Œ≥. Moreover, the matrix of the components of L in {ei} is
L(t, s; Œ≥) = Y (t, s0; ‚àíŒì( ¬∑ ; Œ≥))Y ‚àí1(s, s0; ‚àíŒì( ¬∑ ; Œ≥)),
s, t ‚ààJ
(3.27)
where s0 ‚ààJ is arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed and the matrix Y (s, s0; Z), for a C0 matrix-valued
function Z : s ‚ÜíZ(s), is the unique solution of the initial-valued problem
dY
ds = Z(s)Y,
Y = Y (s, s0; Z),
s ‚ààJ,
(3.28a)
Y (s0, s0; Z) = 1.
(3.28b)
Proof. At the beginning, we note that the existence and uniqueness of the solution
of (3.28) is ensured by Lemma II.3.2 on page 96.
Given a linear transport L with a matrix (3.15). Suppose its components
are exactly Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) in a frame {ei}. Solving (3.25) with respect to dF ‚àí1/ds,
we obtain dF ‚àí1(s; Œ≥)/ds = ‚àíŒì(s; Œ≥)F ‚àí1(s; Œ≥) and, consequently, F ‚àí1(s; Œ≥) =
Y (s, s0; ‚àíŒì( ¬∑ ; Œ≥))F ‚àí1(s0; Œ≥). So, due to equation (3.15), the matrix of L is (3.27).
Because of [34, Chapter IV, equation (1.10)], the expression
Y (t, s; Z) = Y (t, s0; Z)Y (s0, s; Z) = Y (t, s0; Z)Y ‚àí1(s, s0; Z)

3. Linear transports in vector bundles
233
is independent of s0. Besides, as a consequence of (3.26), the matrix (3.27) trans-
forms according to (3.11) when the local bases are changed. Hence equation (3.3)
holds and, due to (3.12), the linear mapping L with a matrix (3.27) in {ei} is a
linear transport along Œ≥. In this way we have proved two things: On one hand, a
linear mapping with a matrix (3.27) in {ei} is a linear transport with local coeÔ¨É-
cients Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) in {ei} along Œ≥ and, on the other hand, any linear transport with
local coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) in {ei} has a matrix (3.27) in {ei}.
‚ñ°
Now we are ready to prove a fundamental result: there exists a bijective
mapping between the sets of C1-linear transports along paths and derivations
along paths. The explicit correspondence between linear transports along paths and
derivations along paths is through the equality of their local coeÔ¨Écients and com-
ponents, respectively, in a given Ô¨Åeld of bases. After the prove of this result, we
shall illustrate it in a case of linear connections on a manifold.
Proposition 3.7. A mapping (2.1a) (resp. (2.1c)) is a derivation along paths (resp.
along Œ≥) iÔ¨Äthere exists a unique linear transport along paths (resp. along Œ≥) gen-
erating it via (3.19). Besides, the components and coeÔ¨Écients of corresponding in
this way, respectively, derivation and linear transport along paths are equal.
Proof. Let {ei(s; Œ≥)} be a frame along Œ≥ and D (resp. DŒ≥) be a derivation along
paths (resp. along Œ≥). DeÔ¨Åne the components Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) of DŒ≥ in {ei} by the expan-
sion (2.3) in which we consider ÀÜei : Œ≥ ‚Üíei( ¬∑ ; Œ≥) as a lifting of paths. They uniquely
deÔ¨Åne DŒ≥ as (2.2) implies (3.23) (see the identical equality (2.4)). Besides, it is
trivial to verify the transformation law (3.26) for them. So, by Proposition 3.6,
there is a unique linear transport along paths (resp. along Œ≥) with the same local
coeÔ¨Écients.
Conversely, as we already proved, to any linear transport L along paths
(resp. along Œ≥) there corresponds a derivation DŒ≥ along Œ≥ given via (3.19) whose
components coincide with the coeÔ¨Écients of LŒ≥ and transform according to (3.26).
‚ñ°
Example 3.1. Let ‚àábe a linear connection (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1) on a C1 dif-
ferentiable manifold M and Œìi
jk(p), i, j, k = 1, . . . , dim M, p ‚ààM, be its lo-
cal coeÔ¨Écients in a Ô¨Åeld {Ei(p)} of bases in the tangent bundle over M, i.e.,
‚àáEiEj = Œìk
jiEk. If Œ≥ is a C1 path in M, the covariant derivative ‚àáÀôŒ≥ = ÀôŒ≥i‚àáEi
along Œ≥ (see Section III.10, in particular equations (III.10.4) and (III.10.5)), ÀôŒ≥
being the vector Ô¨Åeld tangent to Œ≥, is a derivation along Œ≥ in the tensor bundles
over M and its local components are
Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s).
(3.29)
Exercise 3.2. Verify that the unique linear transport along paths, corresponding,
in accordance with Proposition 3.7, to the derivation with local components given
by (3.29), along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM from s to t, with s, t ‚ààJ and s ‚â§t, is exactly the

234
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
parallel transport along Œ≥|[s,t] generated via the initial connection ‚àá. (See DeÔ¨Åni-
tion I.3.2 and, for some details, Section 11.)
Exercise 3.3. Prove that, given on the tangent bundle over M a derivation D
along paths with local components (3.29), then Œìi
jk are the coeÔ¨Écients of a lin-
ear connection ‚àá, which, when restricted to the tangent bundle, is such that
(‚àáV U)|p = DŒ≥
s (U ‚ó¶Œ≥), where Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is any C1 path with ÀôŒ≥(s) = Vp,
Œ≥(s) = p ‚ààM for some s ‚ààJ, and U, V are vector Ô¨Åelds on M.
Example 3.2. Consider a concrete kind of a linear transports L in the trivial line
bundle (B√óR, pr1, B), where B is a topological space, which in particular can be a
C0 manifold, √ó is the Cartesian product sign, and pr1 : B√óR ‚ÜíB is the projection
on B. An element of B √ó R is of the form u = (b, y) for some b ‚ààB and y ‚ààR and
the Ô¨Åbre over c ‚ààB is pr‚àí1
1 (c) = {c} √ó R = {(c, z) : z ‚ààR}; the linear structure
of pr‚àí1
1 (c) is given by Œª1(c, z1) + Œª2(c, z2) = (c, Œª1z1 + Œª2z2) for Œª1, Œª2, z1, z2 ‚ààR.
The bundle (B √ó R, pr1, B) admits a global frame Ô¨Åeld {e1} consisting of a single
section e1 ‚ààSec(B √ó R, pr1, B) such that e1 : B ‚àãb ‚Üíe1(b) = (b, 1) ‚ààpr‚àí1
1 (b).
For Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB and s, t ‚ààJ, deÔ¨Åne L: Œ≥ ‚ÜíLŒ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíLŒ≥

1 (Œ≥(s)),
(3.30)
where f : Œ≥(J) ‚ÜíR \ {0} is a non-vanishing function on Œ≥(J). The veriÔ¨Åcation
of (3.2)-(3.4) is trivial and hence L is a linear transport along paths. Its matrix
in the frame {e1} is L(t, s; Œ≥) = L1
1(t, s; Œ≥) = f(Œ≥(s))
f(Œ≥(t)), in conformity with (3.15). If
f ‚ó¶Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíR\{0} is of class C1, the single coeÔ¨Écient of L is (see (3.24)) Œì1
1(s; Œ≥) =
d
ds ln(f(Œ≥(s))); however, this coeÔ¨Écient is a useful quantity if B √ó R (and hence
B) is a C1 manifold ‚Äì see (3.23). Going some pages ahead (see Proposition 5.2
and DeÔ¨Ånition 4.4 below), we see that the transport L satisÔ¨Åes equation (5.2)
below and therefore admits normal frames; in particular the frame {f1} such that
(see (5.3) below)

for a Ô¨Åxed s0 ‚ààJ and any s ‚ààJ is normal along Œ≥, i.e., the matrix of L in {f1} is
the identity matrix (the number one in the particular case).
4.
Normal frames for linear transports
The parallel transport in a Euclidean space En (or in Rn) has the property that, in
Cartesian coordinates, it preserves the components of the vectors that are trans-
ported, changing only their initial points [3]. This evident observation, which can

4. Normal frames for linear transports
235
be taken even as a deÔ¨Ånition for parallel transport in En, is of fundamental im-
portance when one tries to generalize the situation.
Let L be a linear transport along paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, B), U ‚äÜB
be an arbitrary subset in B, and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU be a path in U.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1. A frame (Ô¨Åeld of bases) in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(J)) is called normal along Œ≥ for
L if the matrix of L in it is the identity matrix along the given path Œ≥.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2. A frame Ô¨Åeld (of bases) deÔ¨Åned on U is called normal on U for L
if it is normal along every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU in U. The frame is called normal for L
if U = B.
Notice that ‚Äònormal‚Äô refers to a ‚Äònormal form‚Äô as opposed to orthogonal to
tangential.
In the context of the present book, we pose the following problem. Given a
linear transport along paths, is it possible to Ô¨Ånd a local basis or a Ô¨Åeld of bases
(frame) in which its matrix is the identity one? Below we shall rigorously formulate
and investigate this problem. If frames with this property exist, we call them
normal (for the transport given). According to (3.12), the linear transports do not
change vectors‚Äô components in such a frame and, conversely, a frame with the last
property is normal. Hence the normal frames are a straightforward generalization
of the Cartesian coordinates in Euclidean space.1 Because of this and following
the established terminology with respect to metrics [11, 12], we call Euclidean a
linear transport admitting normal frame(s).
Since a frame Ô¨Åeld on an arbitrary set U is actually a basis in the set
Sec

(E, œÄ, B)|U

= Sec(œÄ‚àí1(U), œÄ|U, U), we call such a basis normal if the corre-
sponding Ô¨Åeld of bases is normal on U.
Remark 4.1. It should be emphasized that a frame normal on U must be deÔ¨Åned
on U but outside U (if U Ã∏= M), i.e., at points in M\U, it may not be deÔ¨Åned.
In this aspect the frames normal for linear transports diÔ¨Äer from the ones for
derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds, in particular for linear connections, in which case
they must be deÔ¨Åned on an open subset of M containing or equal to U. This
diÔ¨Äerence comes from the fact that in the deÔ¨Ånitions of the normal frames in the
latter case are involved implicitly derivations with respect to some frames or local
coordinates which derivations are well deÔ¨Åned only on neighborhoods, while in the
former case appear only derivations along paths.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.3. A linear transport along paths (or along a path Œ≥) is called Euclidean
along some (or the given) path Œ≥ if it admits a frame normal along Œ≥.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.4. A linear transport along paths is called Euclidean on U if it admits
frame(s) normal on U. It is called Euclidean if U = B.
1According to the argument presented, it is more natural to call Cartesian the special kind
of local bases (or frames) we are talking about. But, in our opinion and for historical reasons, it
is better to use the already established terminology for linear connections and derivations of the
tensor algebra over a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold (see below and [97, appendix A] or [83]).

236
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
We want to note that the name ‚ÄúEuclidean transport‚Äù is connected with the
fact that if we put B = Rn and œÄ‚àí1(p) = Tp(Rn) (the tangent space to Rn at
p) and identify Tp(Rn) with Rn, then in an orthonormal frame, i.e., in Cartesian
coordinates, the Euclidean transport coincides with the standard parallel transport
in Rn (leaving the vectors‚Äô components unchanged).
Example 4.1. Euclidean transports exist always in a case of a trivial bundle (B √ó
V, pr1, B), with V being a vector space and pr1 : B√óV ‚ÜíB being the projection on
B; cf. Example 3.2. For instance, the mapping LŒ≥
s‚Üít(Œ≥(s), v) = (Œ≥(t), v), for v ‚ààV ,
deÔ¨Ånes a Euclidean transport which is similar to the parallel one in Rn. Indeed, if
{fi : i = 1, . . . , , dim V } is a basis of V and v = vifi, then ei : p ‚Üíei|p := (p, fi),
p ‚ààB, is a (global) frame on B if we put viei|p = (p, vifi) = (p, v) and therefore
LŒ≥
s‚Üít(ei|Œ≥(s)) = ei|Œ≥(t), which means that L: Œ≥ ‚ÜíLŒ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíLŒ≥
s‚Üít is a Euclidean
transport and {ei} is a normal frame for it (see Corollary 4.1 below).
Below we present some general results concerning normal frames leaving the
problem of their existence for the next section.
The importance of normal frames is established by the following result.
Proposition 4.1. The following statements are equivalent in a given frame {ei}
over U ‚äÜB:
(i) The matrix of L is the identity (unit) matrix on U, i.e., along every path Œ≥
in U:
L(t, s; Œ≥) = 1.
(4.1a)
(ii) The matrix of L along every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU depends only on Œ≥, i.e., it is inde-
pendent of the points at which it is calculated:
L(t, s; Œ≥) = C(Œ≥)
(4.1b)
where C is a matrix-valued function of Œ≥.
(iii) If E is a C1 manifold, the coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) of L vanish on U, i.e., along
every path Œ≥ in U
Œì(s; Œ≥) = 0.
(4.1c)
(iv) The explicit local action of the derivation D along paths generated by L re-
duces on U to diÔ¨Äerentiation of the components of the liftings with respect to
the path‚Äôs parameter if the path lies entirely in U:
DŒ≥
s Œª = dŒªi
Œ≥(s)
ds
ei(s; Œ≥)
(4.1d)
where Œª = Œªiei ‚ààPLift1
(E, œÄ, B)|U

, with E being a C1 manifold, and
Œª: Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥.

4. Normal frames for linear transports
237
(v) The transport L leaves the vectors‚Äô components unchanged along any path
in U:
LŒ≥
s‚Üít

uiei(s; Œ≥)

= uiei(t; Œ≥)
(4.1e)
where ui ‚ààK.
(vi) The basic vector Ô¨Åelds are L-transported along any path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU:
LŒ≥
s‚Üít

ei(s; Œ≥)

= ei(t; Œ≥).
(4.1f)
Proof. We have to prove the equivalences
L(t, s; Œ≥) = C(Œ≥) ‚áê‚áíL(t, s; Œ≥) = 1 ‚áê‚áíŒì(s; Œ≥) = 0
‚áê‚áíDŒ≥

uiei(s; Œ≥)

= uiei(t; Œ≥)
‚áê‚áíLŒ≥
s‚Üít

ei(s; Œ≥)

= ei(t; Œ≥).
(4.2)
If L(t, s; Œ≥) = C(Œ≥), then, using the representation (3.15), we get F (t; Œ≥) =
F (s; Œ≥)C(Œ≥) = F (s0; Œ≥) for some Ô¨Åxed s0 ‚ààJ as the points s and t are arbi-
trary, so L(t, s0; Œ≥) = F ‚àí1(s0; Œ≥)F (s0; Œ≥) = 1. The inverse implication is trivial.
The second equivalence is a consequence of (3.25) and (3.15) since Œì = 0 implies
F (s; Œ≥) = F (Œ≥), while the third one is a corollary of (3.23). The validity of the last
but one equivalence is a consequence of L(t, s; Œ≥) = 1 ‚áê‚áíLŒ≥
s‚Üít

uiei(s; Œ≥)

=
uiei(t; Œ≥) which follows from (3.12). The last equivalence is a corollary of the lin-
earity of L and the arbitrariness of ui.
‚ñ°
Remark 4.2. An evident corollary of the last proof is
L(t, s; Œ≥) = 1 ‚áê‚áíF (s; Œ≥) = B(Œ≥)
(4.3)
with B being a matrix-valued function of the path Œ≥ only. According to Proposi-
tion 3.5, this dependence is inessential and, consequently, in a normal frame, we
can always choose representation (3.15) with
F (s; Œ≥) = 1.
(4.4)
Corollary 4.1. Any one of the equalities (4.1a)‚Äì(4.1f) express a necessary and
suÔ¨Écient condition for a frame to be normal for L in U.
Proof. This result is a direct consequence of DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2 and Proposition 4.1. ‚ñ°
Proposition 4.2. The equations (4.1a)‚Äì(4.1f) are equivalent in a given frame {ei}
along a (Ô¨Åxed) path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB.
Proof. This proof is identical with the one of Proposition 4.1 for U = Œ≥(J).
‚ñ°
Corollary 4.2. A frame is normal along Œ≥ for L if and only if in that frame one
(and hence all) of the equalities (4.1a)‚Äì(4.1f) is (are) valid.

238
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Proof. The result follows from DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1 and Proposition 4.2.
‚ñ°
In particular, a frame is normal for L along Œ≥ iÔ¨Äin the frame the coeÔ¨Écients
of L vanish along Œ≥, i.e., iÔ¨Ä(4.1c) holds.
A lifting of paths Œª ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, B) is called L-transported along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB,
if for every s, t ‚ààJ is fulÔ¨Ålled
ŒªŒ≥(t) = LŒ≥
s‚ÜítŒªŒ≥(s)
with Œª: Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥. Hence a frame {ei(s, Œ≥)} along Œ≥ is L-transported along Œ≥ if the
liftings ÀÜe1, . . . , ÀÜedim B, deÔ¨Åned via (2.8), are L-transported along Œ≥.
Therefore a frame is normal for L along Œ≥ iÔ¨Äit is L-transported along Œ≥, i.e.,
if, by deÔ¨Ånition, its basic vectors ei(s; Œ≥) satisfy (4.1f). As we shall see below (see
Proposition 4.4), this allows a convenient and useful way for constructing normal
frames, if any.
For the above reasons, sometimes, it is convenient for the DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1 to
be replaced, equivalently, by the next ones.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1‚Ä≤. If E is a C1 manifold, a frame (or frame Ô¨Åeld) over Œ≥(J) is called
normal along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB for a linear transport L along paths if the coeÔ¨Écients of
L along Œ≥ vanish in that frame.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. A frame over Œ≥(J) is called normal along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB for a linear
transport L along paths if it is L-transported along Œ≥.
The last deÔ¨Ånition of a normal frame is, in a sense, the ‚Äòmost invariant (basis-free)‚Äô
one.
The next proposition describes the class of normal frames, if any, along a
given path.
Proposition 4.3. All frames normal for some linear transport along paths which
is Euclidean along a certain (Ô¨Åxed) path are connected by linear transformations
whose matrices may depend only on the given path but not on the point at which
the bases are deÔ¨Åned.
Proof. Let {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i := Aj
iej} be frames normal along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB for a linear
transport L along paths and L and L‚Ä≤ be the matrices of L in them respectively.
As, by deÔ¨Ånition L = L‚Ä≤ = 1, from (3.11), we get A(s; Œ≥) = A(t; Œ≥) for any s, t ‚ààJ,
i.e., A(s; Œ≥) depends only on Œ≥ and not on s.
If E is a C1 manifold and Œì and Œì‚Ä≤ are the matrices of the coeÔ¨Écients of
L in {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i}, respectively, by Proposition 4.1 we have Œì = Œì‚Ä≤ = 0, so the
transformation law (3.26) implies dA(s; Œ≥)/ds = 0, A(s; Œ≥) :=

Aj

s; Œ≥)].
‚ñ°
Corollary 4.3. All frames normal for a Euclidean transport along a given path are
obtained from one of them via linear transformations whose matrices may depend
only on the path given but not on the point at which the bases are deÔ¨Åned.

5. On the existence of normal frames
239
Proof. See Proposition 4.3 or its proof.
‚ñ°
The following two results describe the class of all frames normal on an arbi-
trary set U, if such frames exist.
Corollary 4.4. If a linear transport along paths admits frames normal on a set U,
then all of them are connected via linear transformations with constant (on U)
matrices.
Proof. Let {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i := Aj
iei} be frames normal on U and p ‚ààU. By Proposi-
tion 4.3 (see also DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2) for any paths Œ≤ and Œ≥ in U passing though p, we
have A(p) :=

Aj
i

= B(Œ≤) = B(Œ≥) for some matrix-valued function B on the set
P(U) of the paths in U. Hence A(x) = const on U, due to the arbitrariness of Œ≤
and Œ≥.
‚ñ°
Corollary 4.5. If a linear transport along paths admits a frame normal on a set
U, then all such frames on U for it are obtained from that frame by linear trans-
formations with constant (on U) coeÔ¨Écients.
Proof. The result immediately follows from Corollary 4.4
‚ñ°
We end this section with a simple but important result which shows how the
normal frames, if any, can be constructed along a given path.
Proposition 4.4. If L is Euclidean transport along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB and {e0
i } is a basis
in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)) for some s0 ‚ààJ, then the frame {ei} along Œ≥ deÔ¨Åned by
ei(s; Œ≥) = LŒ≥
s0‚Üís


,
s ‚ààJ
(4.5)
is normal for L along Œ≥.
Proof. Due to (3.2) and (4.5), the frame {ei} satisÔ¨Åes (4.1f) along Œ≥. Hence, by
Corollary 4.2, it is normal for L along Œ≥.
‚ñ°
An analogous result on a set U ‚äÜB will be presented in the next section
(see Proposition 5.5 below).
5.
On the existence of normal frames
In the previous section there were derived a number of properties of the normal
frames, but the problem of their existence was neglected. This is the subject of
the present section.
Following the ideas of the previous chapters, one may attack the problem
of existence of frames normal for a linear transport L along paths as follows.
Suppose {ei} is a frame on U ‚äÜB (resp. along Œ≥) and Œì(s; Œ≥) is the matrix of the
coeÔ¨Écients of L along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU (resp. along the given path Œ≥). Then L admits a
frame {e‚Ä≤
i} normal on U (resp. along Œ≥) iÔ¨Äthere is a matrix-valued function A :=

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
[Ai
j]: (s, Œ≥) ‚ÜíA(s; Œ≥) = A(Œ≥(s)) (resp. A: (s, Œ≥) ‚ÜíA(s; Œ≥)) transforming {ei} into
{e‚Ä≤
i}, e‚Ä≤
i(s; Œ≥) = Aj
i(s; Œ≥)ej(s; Œ≥), and satisfying, by virtue of (4.1c) and (3.26), the
equation
dA(s; Œ≥)
ds
+ Œì(s; Œ≥)A(s; Œ≥) = 0
(5.1)
for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU and s ‚ààJ (resp. for the given path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB and s ‚ààJ).
This assertion is also an obvious corollary of the transformation law (3.26) and
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1‚Ä≤ (or Proposition 4.1, points (i) and (iii)). Therefore all problems
concerning the properties and existence of frames normal on U (resp. along Œ≥)
can be reduced to the investigation of the equation (5.1) with A(s; Œ≥) = A(Œ≥(s)),
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU (resp. with A depending, generally, separately on s and Œ≥); for this,
we call (5.1) the normal frame equation along Œ≥ for L. We shall comment on this
approach in Subsection 13.4. Below we shall follow other, more direct, methods
which are primary related to the (‚Äòglobal‚Äô) general properties of the linear trans-
ports along paths.
At a given point p ‚ààB the following result is valid.
Proposition 5.1. A linear transport LŒ≥ along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB such that Œ≥(J) = {p} for
a given point p ‚ààB admits normal frame(s) iÔ¨Äit is the identity mapping of the
Ô¨Åbre over p, i.e., LŒ≥
s‚Üít = idœÄ‚àí1(p) for every s, t ‚ààJ.
Proof. The suÔ¨Éciency is trivial (see DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1). If {ei} is normal for LŒ≥ (at
p), then LŒ≥
s‚Üít(uiei|p) = uiLŒ≥
s‚Üítei|p = uiei|p, ui ‚ààK, due to Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t) = p and
Proposition 4.1, point (iv). Therefore LŒ≥
s‚Üít = idœÄ‚àí1(p).
‚ñ°
Thus, for a degenerate path Œ≥ : J ‚Üí{p} ‚äÇB for some p ‚ààB, the identity
mapping of the Ô¨Åbre over p is the only realization of a Euclidean transport along
paths. Evidently, for such a transport every basis of that Ô¨Åbre is a frame normal
at p for it.
Proposition 5.2. A linear transport L along paths admits frame(s) normal along a
given path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB iÔ¨Ä
LŒ≥
s‚Üít = idœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s))
for every s, t ‚ààJ such that Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t),
(5.2)
i.e., if Œ≥ contains loops, the L-transport along each of them reduces to the identity
mapping of the Ô¨Åbre over the initial/Ô¨Ånal point of the transportation.
Remark 5.1. For s = t the equation (5.2) is identically satisÔ¨Åed due to (3.3). But
for s Ã∏= t, if such s and t exist, this is highly non-trivial restriction: it means
that the result of L-transportation along Œ≥ of a vector u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(x0) for some
x0 ‚ààŒ≥(J) from x0 to a point x ‚ààŒ≥(J) is independent of how long the vector
has ‚Äòtravelled‚Äô along Œ≥ or, more precisely, if x0, x ‚ààŒ≥(J) are Ô¨Åxed and, for each
y ‚ààŒ≥(J), Jy := {r ‚ààJ : Œ≥(r) = y}, then the vector LŒ≥
s0‚Üís(u) is independent
of the choice of the points s0 ‚ààJx0 and s ‚ààJx (if some of the sets Jx0 and/or
Jx contain more than one point). This is trivial if Œ≥ is without self-intersections

5. On the existence of normal frames
241
(see (3.2)). If Œ≥ has self-intersections, e.g., if Œ≥ intersects itself one time at Œ≥(s),
i.e., if Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t) for some s, t ‚ààJ, s Ã∏= t, then the result of L-transportation
of u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)) from p0 = Œ≥(s0) to p = Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t) along Œ≥ is us = LŒ≥
s0‚Üísu
or ut = LŒ≥
s0‚Üítu. We have us = ut iÔ¨Ä(5.2) holds. Rewording, if we Ô¨Åx some
u0 ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)), the bundle-valued function u: Œ≥(J) ‚ÜíE given by u: Œ≥(s) ‚Üí
us = LŒ≥
s0‚Üísu0 ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) for s ‚ààJ is single-valued iÔ¨Ä(5.2) is valid.1 Notice,
since œÄ ‚ó¶us ‚â°Œ≥(s) (see (3.1)), the mapping u is (a single-valued) lifting of Œ≥ in E
through u0 irrespectively of the validity of (5.2).
Prima facie the above may be reformulated in terms of the concept of holon-
omy in vector bundles [23, pp. 51‚Äì54]. But a rigorous analysis reveals that this
is impossible in the general case without imposing further restrictions, like equa-
tion (5.6) below, on the transports involved. For instance, without requiring equa-
tion (5.6) below to be valid, one cannot introduce the concept of a holonomy
group.
Proof. If L is Euclidean along Œ≥, then (5.2) follows from equation (4.1e) as it holds
for every ui ‚ààK in some normal frame {ei}. Conversely, let (5.2) be valid. Put
ei|Œ≥(s) := LŒ≥
s0‚Üís

e0
i

(5.3)
where {e0
i } is a Ô¨Åxed basis in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)) for a Ô¨Åxed s0 ‚ààJ. Due to the nondegen-
eracy of L, {ei} is a basis at Œ≥(s) for every s. According to (5.2), the so-deÔ¨Åned
Ô¨Åeld of bases {ei} along Œ≥ is single-valued. By means of (3.2), we easily verify
that (4.1f) holds for {ei}. Hence {ei} is normal for L along Œ≥.
‚ñ°
Remark 5.2. Regardless of the validity of (5.2), equation (5.3) deÔ¨Ånes a Ô¨Åeld of,
generally multiple-valued, normal frames in the set of sections along Œ≥ of (E, œÄ, B).
Such a multi-valued property can be avoid if Œ≥ is supposed to be injective (‚áîwith-
out self-intersections). Prima facie one may think that this solves the multi-valued
problem in the general case by decomposing Œ≥ into a union of injective paths. How-
ever, this is not the most general situation because a transport along a composition
of paths does not generally equal to the composition of the transports along its
constituent sub-paths (see equation (5.6) below); besides, since equation (5.10)
below does not hold generally, the absents of a natural/canonical deÔ¨Ånition of
composition (product) of paths introduces an additional indeÔ¨Åniteness.
Corollary 5.1. Every linear transport along paths is Euclidean along every Ô¨Åxed
path without self-intersections.
Proof. For a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB without self-intersections, the equality Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t),
s, t ‚ààJ is equivalent to s = t. So, according to (3.3), the condition (5.2) is
identically satisÔ¨Åed.
‚ñ°
Now we shall establish an important necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for
the existence of frames normal on an arbitrary subset U ‚äÜB.
1The so-deÔ¨Åned mapping u is a multiple-valued section along Œ≥ (see Subsection 2.3).

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Theorem 5.1. A linear transport along paths admits frames normal on some set
(resp. along a given path) if and only if its action along every path in this set
(resp. along the given path) depends only on the initial and Ô¨Ånal points of the
transportation but not on the particular path connecting these points. In other
words, a transport is Euclidean on U ‚äÜB iÔ¨Äit is path-independent on U.
Proof. Let a linear transport L admit a frame {ei} normal on U ‚äÜB. By (3.12)
and DeÔ¨Ånitions 4.1 and 4.2, this implies LŒ≥
s‚Üítui(Œ≥(s))

ei|Œ≥(s)

= ui(Œ≥(s))ei|Œ≥(t)
for Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU and u(p) ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààB. Conversely, let LŒ≥
s‚Üítu(Œ≥(s)) depend
only on Œ≥(s) and Œ≥(t) but not on Œ≥ and {ei} be a Ô¨Åeld of bases on U (resp. on
Œ≥(J)). Then, due to (3.12), the matrix L of L in {ei} has the form L(t, s; Œ≥) =
B(Œ≥(t), Œ≥(s)) for some matrix-valued function B on U √ó U. Combining this result
with Propositions 3.4 and 3.5, we see that L admits a representation
L(t, s; Œ≥) = F ‚àí1
0 (Œ≥(t))F 0(Œ≥(s)),
s, t ‚ààJ
(5.4)
for some non-degenerate matrix-valued function F 0 on the set U. Putting e‚Ä≤
i|p =

F ‚àí1
0 (p)
j
iej|p, p ‚ààU, we obtain from (3.11) that the matrix of L in {e‚Ä≤
i} is
L‚Ä≤(t, s; Œ≥) = 1, i.e., the frame {e‚Ä≤
i} is normal for L on U.
‚ñ°
An evident corollary of Theorem 5.1 is the following assertion. Let a linear
transport L be Euclidean on U ‚äÜB and ha : J ‚ÜíU, a ‚àà[0, 1], be a homotopy of
paths passing through two Ô¨Åxed points p, q ‚ààU, i.e., ha(s0) = p and ha(t0) = q
for some s0, t0 ‚ààJ and any a ‚àà[0, 1]. Then Lha
s0‚Üít0 is independent of a ‚àà[0, 1]. In
particular, we have Lha
s0‚Üít0
		
q=p = idœÄ‚àí1(p) owing to Proposition 5.2.
Equation (5.4) and the part of the proof of Theorem 5.1 after it are a hint
for the formulation of the following result.
Theorem 5.2. A linear transport L along paths in a vector bundle, with C1 manifold
as a bundle space, is Euclidean on U (resp. along Œ≥) iÔ¨Äfor some, and hence for
every, frame {ei} on U (resp. on Œ≥(J)) there exists a matrix-valued function F 0
on U such that the matrix L of L in {ei} is given by (5.4) for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU
(resp. for the given Œ≥) or, equivalently, iÔ¨Äthe matrix Œì of the coeÔ¨Écients of L in
{ei} is
Œì(s; Œ≥) = F ‚àí1
0 (Œ≥(s))dF 0(Œ≥(s))
ds
.
(5.4‚Ä≤)
Proof. Suppose a linear transport L is Euclidean. There is a frame {e0
i } nor-
mal for L on U (resp. along Œ≥). DeÔ¨Åne a matrix F 0(p) via the expansion ei|p =

F 0(p)
j
ie0
j
		
p, p ‚ààU. Since, by deÔ¨Ånition, the matrix of L in {e0
i } is the unit
(identity) matrix on U, the matrix of L in {ei} is given via (5.4) due to (3.11).
Conversely, if (5.4) holds in {ei} on U, the frame {e‚Ä≤
i|p =

F ‚àí1
0 (p)
j
ie0
j
		
p} is nor-
mal for L on U (resp. along Œ≥), as we saw at the end of the proof of Theorem 5.1.
The equivalence of (5.4‚Ä≤) and (5.4) is a consequence of (3.24) (cf. (3.25), (3.26),
and (4.2)).

5. On the existence of normal frames
243
Remark 5.3. An alternative proof of theorem follows directly from equation (5.1):
we have A(s; Œ≥) = A(Œ≥(s)) and (5.4‚Ä≤) is valid for F 0 = A‚àí1.
The proof of Theorem 5.2 suggest a way for generating Euclidean transports
along paths by ‚Äòinverting‚Äô the deÔ¨Ånition of normal frames: take a given Ô¨Åeld of
bases over U ‚äÜB and deÔ¨Åne a linear transport by requiring its matrix to be the
identity matrix in the given Ô¨Åeld of bases. More precisely, we have in mind the
following. Let {ei} be a Ô¨Åxed frame on U, {e‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iej}, with A =

Aj
i

being
non-degenerate, be arbitrary frame on U, and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU be a path in U. DeÔ¨Åne a
linear mapping (3.1) by its matrix in {e‚Ä≤
i} (see (3.12)):
L(t, s; Œ≥) = A(Œ≥(t))A‚àí1(Œ≥(s)),
A(p) :=

Aj
i (p)

,
p ‚ààU.
(5.5)
According to Proposition 3.4, the mapping L: Œ≥ ‚ÜíLŒ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíLŒ≥
s‚Üít is a linear
transport along paths. By Theorem 5.1, this transport is Euclidean. Moreover,
from (3.11), we see that the matrix of L in {ei} is unit on U, i.e., {ei} is a frame
normal for L on U. We call this Euclidean transport generated by (or assigned to)
the given initial frame, which is normal for it.
Proposition 5.3. All frames normal for a Euclidean linear transport along paths
in U generate one and the same Euclidean transport along paths in U coinciding
with the initial one.
Proof. The result is an almost evident consequence of (5.5) and Corollary 4.5.
‚ñ°
Proposition 5.4. Two or more frames on U generate one and the same Euclidean
transport along paths iÔ¨Äthey are connected via linear transformations with con-
stant (on U) coeÔ¨Écients.
Proof. If {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i} generate L, then they are normal for it (Proposition 5.3)
and, by Corollary 4.4, they are connected in the way pointed. The converse is a
trivial corollary of (5.5) for A(p) = const with p ‚ààU.
‚ñ°
In this way we have established a bijective correspondence between the set
of Euclidean linear transports along paths in U and the class of sets of frames on
U connected by linear transformations with constant coeÔ¨Écients.
The comparison of Proposition 5.2 with Theorem 5.1 suggests that a trans-
port is Euclidean in U ‚äÜB iÔ¨Ä(5.2) holds for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU. But this is not
exactly the case. The right result is the following one.
Theorem 5.3. A linear transport L along paths is Euclidean on some path-con-
nected set2 U ‚äÜB iÔ¨Äthe next three conditions are valid:
(i) Equation (5.2) holds for every continuous path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU;
2A set is path-connected if every two its points can be connected by a continuous path lying
entirely in it. Sometimes such sets are called linearly connected or arc-connected.

244
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
(ii) The transport along a product of paths is equal to the composition of the
transports long the paths of the product, i.e.,
LŒ≥1Œ≥2 = LŒ≥2 ‚ó¶LŒ≥1
(5.6)
where Œ≥1 and Œ≥2 are paths in U such that the end of Œ≥1 coincides with the
beginning of Œ≥2 and Œ≥1Œ≥2 is the product of these paths;
(iii) For any subinterval J‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ the locality condition
LŒ≥|J‚Ä≤
s‚Üít = LŒ≥
s‚Üít,
s, t ‚ààJ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ,
(5.7)
with Œ≥|J‚Ä≤ being the restriction of Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU to J‚Ä≤, is valid.
Remark 5.4. Here and below we do not present and use a particular deÔ¨Ånition of
the product of paths. There are slightly diÔ¨Äerent versions of that deÔ¨Ånition; for
details see [108,132] or [114, Section 3]. Our results are independent of any concrete
such deÔ¨Ånition because the transports, we are considering here, are independent
of the particular path they are acting along (see Theorem 5.1).
Proof. If L is Euclidean, then, by DeÔ¨Ånition 4.4, it admits normal frame(s) along
every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU and, consequently, according to Proposition 5.2, the condi-
tion (5.2) is valid along every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU. By Theorem 5.1, the transport LŒ≥
s‚Üít,
s, t ‚ààJ depends only on the points p = Œ≥(s) and q = Œ≥(t) but not on the particular
path Œ≥ connecting p, q ‚ààU. Equations (5.6) and (5.7) follow from here.
Conversely, let (5.2), (5.6), and (5.7) be true for all paths Œ≥, Œ≥1, and Œ≥2 in
U, the end of Œ≥1 coinciding with the beginning of Œ≥2, and subinterval J‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ.
Meanwhile, we notice the equality
LŒ≥‚àí1 =

LŒ≥‚àí1,
(5.8)
Œ≥‚àí1 being the path inverse to Œ≥,3 which is a consequence of (5.2) and (5.6).
Let p0 be arbitrarily chosen Ô¨Åxed point in U and {e0
i } an arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed
basis in the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(p0) over it. In the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(p) over p ‚ààU, we deÔ¨Åne a basis

the Ô¨Åeld {ei} of bases over U is normal for L on U.
At Ô¨Årst, we shall prove the independence of ei|p from the particular continu-
ous path Œ≥p0,p. Let Œ≤a : Ja ‚ÜíU, a = 1, 2 and Œ≤a(sa) = p0 and Œ≤a(ta) = p for some
sa, ta ‚ààJa, a = 1, 2. For deÔ¨Åniteness, we assume sa ‚â§ta. (The other combinations

Since Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 are arbitrary, from here we conclude that the frame {ei},
deÔ¨Åned via (5.9) on U, is independent from the particular path used in (5.9).
Now we shall prove that {ei} is normal for L on U, which will complete this
proof.
From the proof of Proposition 5.2 (compare (5.9) and (5.3)) follows that
{ei} is normal for L along any path in U passing through p0. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU
be such a path, s0 ‚ààJ be Ô¨Åxed, and Œ≤ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíU be such that Œ≤(0) = p and
Œ≤(1) = Œ≥(s0) =: p0. DeÔ¨Åning Œ≥¬± := Œ≥|J¬± for J¬± := {s ‚ààJ, ¬±s ‚â•¬±s0}, we
conclude that {ei} is normal for L along Œ≤Œ≥+ and Œ≤Œ≥‚àí1
‚àí. Take, for example, the
path Œ≤Œ≥+. If for some s‚Ä≤
0, s‚Ä≤, s‚àó‚ààR is fulÔ¨Ålled (Œ≤Œ≥+)(s‚Ä≤
0) = p, (Œ≤Œ≥+)(s‚Ä≤) = Œ≥(s),
and (Œ≤Œ≥+)(s‚àó) = p0, then, applying (5.9), (5.6), and (5.7), we Ô¨Ånd for s ‚â•s0:

by Corollary 4.1, the frame so-constructed is normal for L along Œ≥.

Remark 5.5. According to [114, Proposition 3.4], the equality (5.6) is a conse-

where J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ is an R-interval and œÑ : J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíJ is bijection. Hence in the formulation of
Theorem 5.3 we can replace the condition (5.6) with (5.10). So, we have:
Theorem 5.3‚Ä≤. A transport L is Euclidean on a path-connected set U ‚äÜB if (5.2),
(5.7), and (5.10) are valid for every continuous path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU.

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Remark 5.6. A transport along paths satisfying (5.7) and (5.10) is in fact a parallel
transport (along paths). For details, see Section V.8.
The next result is analogous to Proposition 4.4. According to it, a frame
normal for L on U ‚äÜB, if any, can be obtained by L-transportation of a Ô¨Åxed
basis over some point in U to the other points in U.
Proposition 5.5. If L is a Euclidean transport on a path-connected set U ‚äÜB and
{e0
i } is a given basis in œÄ‚àí1(p0) for a Ô¨Åxed p0 ‚ààU, then the frame {ei} over U

(5.11)
where Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU is such that Œ≥(s0) = p0 and Œ≥(s) = p for some s0, s ‚ààJ, is
normal for L on U.
Proof. By Theorem 5.1, the basis {ei|p} is independent of the particular path Œ≥
used in (5.11). According to Theorem 5.3, the conditions (5.2), (5.6), and (5.7)
hold for L. Further, repeating step-by-step the last paragraph of the proof of
Theorem 5.3, we verify that {ei} is normal for L on U.
Alternatively, the assertion is a consequence of (3.21) and Proposition 5.6
presented a few lines below.
‚ñ°
A simple way to check whether a given frame is normal along some path is
provided by the following proposition.
Proposition 5.6. A frame {ei} along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíB is normal for a linear transport
L along paths in (E, œÄ, B), E being a C1 manifold, if and only if the liftings
ÀÜei : Œ≥ ‚Üíei( ¬∑ , Œ≥) are constant (along Œ≥) with respect to the derivation D generated
by L:
DŒ≥ÀÜei = 0.
(5.12)
Proof. If {ei} is normal for L along Œ≥, equation (4.1f) is valid (see Corollary 4.2),
so (5.12) follows from (3.21). If (5.12) holds, by virtue of (3.21), its solution is4
ei|Œ≥(s) = LŒ≥
s0‚Üís

ei|Œ≥(s0)

and consequently, by Proposition 4.4, the frame {ei} is
normal along Œ≥.
‚ñ°
Recall (see the remark preceding DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1), the path Œ≥ in Proposition 5.6
cannot be an arbitrary continuous path in B as it must be in the set œÄ‚ó¶Pk(E), with
Pk(E), k = 0, 1, being the set of Ck paths in E. Notice, the derivative in (5.12)
does not require B to be a manifold.
Of course, it is true that if (5.12) holds in a frame {ei} along every path
Œ≥ in U, the frame {ei} is normal for L on U. But it is more natural to Ô¨Ånd a
‚Äòglobal‚Äô version of (5.12) concerning the whole set U, not the paths in it. The
corresponding result is formulated below as Theorem 9.1 (see also Theorem 6.1).
4Equation (5.12) is an ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equation of Ô¨Årst order with respect to the local
components of ei (see (3.23)).

The case of a manifold as a base
Starting from this section, we consider some peculiarities of frames normal for
linear transports along paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) whose base M is a
C1 diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. Besides, the bundle space E will be required to be
a C1 manifold too. This will allow links to be made with the general results of
Chapter III concerning frames normal for derivations of the tensor algebra of the
vector space of vector Ô¨Åelds over a manifold which, in particular, can be linear
connections.
The local coordinates of p ‚ààM will be denoted by p¬µ, p¬µ := x¬µ(p). Here
and below the Greek indices Œ±, Œ≤, . . . , ¬µ, ŒΩ, . . . run from 1 to dim M and, as usual,
a summation from 1 to dim M on such indices repeated on diÔ¨Äerent levels will be
assumed. The below-considered paths, like Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, are supposed to be of class
C1 and by ÀôŒ≥(s) is denoted the vector tangent to Œ≥ at Œ≥(s), s ‚ààJ, (more precisely
at s) i.e., ÀôŒ≥ is the vector Ô¨Åeld tangent to Œ≥ provided Œ≥ is injective. By {E¬µ} will be
denoted a frame along Œ≥ in the bundle space tangent to M, i.e., for every s ‚ààJ
the vectors E1|Œ≥(s), . . . , Edim M|Œ≥(s) form a basis in the space TŒ≥(s)(M) tangent to
M at Œ≥(s). In particular, the frame {E¬µ} can be a coordinate one, E¬µ|p =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ
		
p,
in some neighborhood of p ‚ààŒ≥(J). The transports along paths investigated below
are supposed to be of class C1 on the set of C1 paths in M.
Proposition 6.1. Let L be a linear transport along paths in (E, œÄ, M), E and M
being C1 manifolds, and L be Euclidean on U ‚äÜM (resp. along a C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚Üí
M). Then the matrix Œì of its coeÔ¨Écients has the representation
Œì(s; Œ≥) =
dim M

¬µ=1
Œì¬µ(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(s) ‚â°Œì¬µ(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(s)
(6.1)
in any frame {ei} along every (resp. the given) C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU, where Œì¬µ =

Œìi
j¬µ
dim œÄ‚àí1(p)
i,j=1
are some matrix-valued functions, deÔ¨Åned on an open set V con-
taining U (resp. Œ≥(J)) or equal to it, and ÀôŒ≥¬µ are the components of ÀôŒ≥ in some
frame {E¬µ} along Œ≥ in the bundle space T (M) tangent to M, ÀôŒ≥ = ÀôŒ≥¬µE¬µ.
Proof. By Theorem 5.2, the representation (5.4‚Ä≤) is valid in {ei} for some matrix-
valued function F 0 on U. Hence, if U is a neighborhood, equation (6.1) holds
for
Œì¬µ(p) = F ‚àí1
0 (p)

E¬µ(F 0)|p

(6.2)
with p ‚ààU. In the general case, e.g., if U is a submanifold of M of dimension less
than the one of M, the terms E¬µ(F 0)|U, ¬µ = 1, . . . , dim M, in the last equality
may turn to be undeÔ¨Åned as the matrix-valued function F 0 is deÔ¨Åned only on U.
To overcome this possible problem, let us take some C1 matrix-valued function
F , deÔ¨Åned on an open set V containing U (resp. Œ≥(J)) or equal to it, such that
F |U = F 0. Since (5.4) and (5.4‚Ä≤) depend only on the values of F 0, i.e., on the

248
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
ones of F on U, these equations hold also if we replace F 0 in them with F . From
the so-modiÔ¨Åed equality (5.4‚Ä≤), with F for F 0, we see that (6.1) is valid for
Œì¬µ(p) = F ‚àí1(p)(E¬µ(F ))|p
(6.3)
with p ‚ààV .
‚ñ°
Consider now the transformation properties of the matrices Œì¬µ in (6.1). Let
U be an open set, e.g., U = M. If we change the frame {E¬µ} in the bundle space
tangent to M, {E¬µ} ‚Üí{E‚Ä≤
¬µ = BŒΩ

i(p)ej|p}, then, from (3.26) and (6.1), we see that Œì¬µ transforms
into Œì‚Ä≤

(6.4)
where A :=

is non-degenerate and of class C1.
Note 6.1. While deriving (6.4), we supposed (6.1) to be valid on M, i.e., for
U = M. If U Ã∏= M, equation (6.1) holds only on U, i.e., for Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU. Therefore
the result (6.4) is true only on U, but in this case the frames {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i}
must be deÔ¨Åned on an open subset of M containing or equal to U. This follows
from (3.26) in which the derivative dA(s;Œ≥)
ds
= dA(Œ≥(s))
ds
enters. To derive (6.4), we
have expressed dA(Œ≥(s))
ds
as (E¬µ(A))|Œ≥(s) ÀôŒ≥¬µ(s) which is meaningful iÔ¨ÄA is deÔ¨Åned
on a neighborhood of each point in U. Consequently A, as well as {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i},
must be deÔ¨Åned on an open set V ‚äáU. For this reason, below, when derivatives
like E¬µ(A) appear, we admit the employed frames in the bundle space E to be
deÔ¨Åned always on some neighborhood in M containing or equal to the set U on
which some normal frames are investigated.
The above considerations, when applied to parallel transports assigned to
linear connections (see below Section 11) in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M), are
the cause for which in the deÔ¨Ånition of frames normal for a linear connection (see
DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.1 on page 37) is included the requirement they to be deÔ¨Åned on a
neighborhood, possibly coinciding with U if U is a neighborhood.
Denoting by Œìi
j¬µ the components of Œì¬µ, we can rewrite (6.4) as
Œì‚Ä≤i
j¬µ =

(6.5)
Thus, we observe that the functions Œìi
j¬µ are very similar to the coeÔ¨Écients of a
linear connection.1 Below, in Subsection 13.4, we shall see that this is not acci-
dental (compare (6.1) with (3.29)). These functions are also called coeÔ¨Écients of
1Compare (6.4) with (I.5.3) or (6.5) with (I.3.5). The equations in these pairs are identical
for dim M = dim œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààM, and B = A.

6. The case of a manifold as a base

the transport L. To make a distinction between Œìi
j and Œìi
j¬µ, we call the former
ones 2-index coeÔ¨Écients of L and the latter ones 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L when
there is a risk of ambiguities. It should be emphasized on the fact that the 2-index
coeÔ¨Écients are deÔ¨Åned with respect to a single frame {ei} along Œ≥ in the vector
bundle (E, œÄ, M), while the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients are deÔ¨Åned with respect to a pair
({ei}, {E¬µ}) of frames, {ei} in the bundle space E of (E, œÄ, M) and {E¬µ} in the
bundle space T (M) of the bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) tangent to M. Besides, if (6.1)
holds for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU for a transport L, then, in the general case, there are
(inÔ¨Ånitely) many such representations unless U an open set. For instance, if (6.1)
is valid for some Œì¬µ, it is also true if we replace in it Œì¬µ with Œì¬µ + G¬µ where the
matrix-valued functions G¬µ are such that G¬µ ÀôŒ≥¬µ = 0 for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU. Hence,
generally, the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L depend also on U and are not unique due
to, e.g., the nonuniqueness of F in (6.3).
Prima facie one may think that the converse of Proposition 6.1 is true, but
this is not the general case, i.e., if in some frame equation (6.1) holds, then {ei}
is generally not normal unless some conditions are fulÔ¨Ålled. Thus (6.1) is only a
necessary, but, generally, not suÔ¨Écient condition for a frame to be normal.
Theorem 6.1. A C2 linear transport L along paths is Euclidean on a neighborhood
U ‚äÜM if and only if in every frame the matrix Œì of its coeÔ¨Écients has a repre-
sentation (6.1) along every C1 path Œ≥ in U in which the matrix-valued functions
Œì¬µ, deÔ¨Åned on an open set containing U or equal to it, satisfy the equalities

R¬µŒΩ(‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M)

where p ‚ààU and
R¬µŒΩ(‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M) := ‚àíEŒΩ(Œì¬µ) + E¬µ(ŒìŒΩ) + Œì¬µŒìŒΩ ‚àíŒìŒΩŒì¬µ ‚àíCŒ∫

in a frame {E¬µ} over U in the bundle space tangent to M, with CŒ∫
¬µŒΩ being the
structure functions of {E¬µ}, [E¬µ, EŒΩ] =: CŒ∫
¬µŒΩEŒ∫.
Remark 6.1. This result is a direct analogue of Theorem III.6.1 on page 157 in
the theory considered here.
Remark 6.2. If we change the frame {ei}, {ei} ‚Üí{e‚Ä≤
i = Aj

simultaneously the frame {E¬µ}, {E¬µ} ‚Üí{E‚Ä≤
¬µ = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ}, in the tangent bundle
space over U, from (6.7), (I.8.4), and (6.4), we get that the matrices R¬µŒΩ transform
into
R‚Ä≤
¬µŒΩ = BŒ∫

ŒΩ A‚àí1RŒ∫ŒªA.
(6.8)
Therefore the conditions (6.6) have an invariant character, i.e., they are indepen-
dent of the particular choice of the frames (or coordinates) involved in them. The
last result also shows that the quantities R¬µŒΩ depend on the frames {ei} and {E¬µ}
on U and are completely independent of the their values outside U (if U Ã∏= M) in
case they are deÔ¨Åned there (see Note 6.1).

250
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Remark 6.3 (Important!). This theorem has a stronger version: the requirement
the representation (6.1) to hold can be dropped as it is a consequence of (6.6). We
skip this detail till Subsection 9.2 (see the proof of Theorem 9.1 and the comments
after it on page 269). Corollary 9.1 on page 269 is a formulation of the mentioned
stronger variant of Theorem 6.1 employing the concept of a ‚Äòcurvature‚Äô. The same
remarks are valid with respect to Theorem 6.2 on page 253 below.
Proof. Necessity. For a transport L Euclidean on U is valid (6.1) due to Propo-
sition 6.1. Moreover, we know from the proof of this proposition that Œì¬µ admit
representation (6.3) for some C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function F . The
proof of the necessity is completed by the following lemma.
Lemma 6.1. A set of matrix-valued functions {Œì¬µ : ¬µ = 1, . . . , dim M}, of class
C1 and deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood V , admits a representation (6.3) iÔ¨Äthe condi-
tions (6.6) are fulÔ¨Ålled for p ‚ààV .
Proof of Lemma 6.1. A representation (6.3) exists iÔ¨Äit, considered as a matrix
linear partial diÔ¨Äerential equation of Ô¨Årst order, has a solution with respect to F .
Rewriting (6.3) as
E¬µ(F ‚àí1)|p = ‚àíŒì¬µ(p)F ‚àí1(p),
p ‚ààV,
from Lemma II.4.1 on page 105 with N = M and E¬µ for e¬µ, we conclude that the
solutions of this equation with respect to F ‚àí1 exist iÔ¨Ä(6.6) holds. In fact, Ô¨Åxing
some initial value F ‚àí1(p0) = f0, we get (see Remark II.4.5)
F (p) = f ‚àí1
0 Y ‚àí1(p, p0; ‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M)
(6.9)
where Y (p, p0; Z1, . . . , Zdim M) is the solution of the initial-value problem
E¬µ(Y )|p = Z¬µ(p)Y |p,
Y |p=p0 = 1.
(6.10)
Here Z1, . . . , Zdim M are continuous matrix-valued functions and 1 is the identity
(unit) matrix of the corresponding size. According to Lemma II.4.1, the prob-
lem (6.10) with Z¬µ = ‚àíŒì¬µ has (a unique) solution (of class C2) iÔ¨Äthe (integrabil-
ity) conditions (6.6) are valid.
‚ñ°
Sufficiency. Let (6.1) and (6.6) be valid. As a consequence of Lemma 6.1,
there is a representation (6.3) for Œì with some F . Substituting (6.3) into (6.1), we
get
Œì(s; Œ≥) = F ‚àí1(Œ≥(s))E¬µ(F )|Œ≥(s) ÀôŒ≥¬µ(s) = F ‚àí1(Œ≥(s))dF (Œ≥(s))
ds
.
So, by Theorem 5.2 (see (5.4‚Ä≤) for F 0 = F |U), the considered transport L along
paths is Euclidean.
‚ñ°
The just-proved Theorem 6.1 expresses a very important practical necessary
and suÔ¨Écient condition for existence of frames normal on neighborhoods because

6. The case of a manifold as a base
251
the conditions (6.1) and (6.6) are easy to check for a given linear transport along
paths in bundles with a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold as a base.
Now, combining (4.1c) and (6.1), applying Corollaries 4.1 and 4.2, and using
the arbitrariness of Œ≥, we can formulate the following essential result.
Proposition 6.2. A necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for a frame to be normal
on a neighborhood U ‚äÜM for a Euclidean on U linear transport along paths in
(E, œÄ, M) is the vanishment of its 3-index coeÔ¨Écients, i.e.,
Œì¬µ(p) :=

Œìi
j¬µ
dim œÄ‚àí1(p)
i,j=1
= 0
(6.11)
for every p ‚ààU, where Œì¬µ(p) deÔ¨Åne the (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients of the transport
via (6.1).
Remark 6.4. The assumption in this proposition for U to be a neighborhood is an
essential one. From it and the arbitrariness of Œ≥ follows that ÀôŒ≥(s) is an arbitrary
vector in TŒ≥(s)(M) which, together with (6.1) and Œì(s; Œ≥) = 0, implies (6.11). If
U is not a neighborhood, then, generally, such a conclusion can not be made. For
instance, if U is a submanifold of M and dim U < dim M, then ÀôŒ≥(s) ‚ààTŒ≥(s)(U) but
ÀôŒ≥(s) Ã∏‚ààTŒ≥(s)(M)\TŒ≥(s)(U) as Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU is a path in U. Therefore, in this example,
only dim U of the matrices Œì1, . . . , Œìdim M must vanish in a (suitable) frame normal
on U, the remaining dim M ‚àídim U of them need not to be zeros on U. Obviously,
this assertion can be inverted, i.e., frames normal on a submanifold U exist iÔ¨Äin
them dim U of the matrices of the transport‚Äôs 3-index coeÔ¨Écients vanish on U
(in suitable coordinates or frames). More details for normal frames in which the
3-index coeÔ¨Écients of a linear transport vanish are presented in Section 12.
Because of Propositions 6.1 and 6.2, as we said above, the functions Œìi
j¬µ are
convenient to be called also coeÔ¨Écients of the transport, like Œìi
j. If there is a risk
of ambiguity whether we have in mind Œìi
j or Œìi
j¬µ, when speaking about trans-
port‚Äôs (or corresponding derivation‚Äôs) coeÔ¨Écients, we shall call them respectively
2-index and 3-index coeÔ¨Écients. Note that any linear transport has 2-index coef-
Ô¨Åcients while 3-index ones exist only for some of them; in particular such are the
Euclidean transports (see Proposition 6.1 and Theorem 6.2). Through the 3-index
coeÔ¨Écients can be deÔ¨Åned concrete classes of, possibly Euclidean on some sets,
linear transports along paths in a given vector bundle with a manifold as a base.
For the purpose one should deÔ¨Åne a transport by the matrix (6.1) of its 2-index
coeÔ¨Écients in which Œì¬µ are Ô¨Åxed matrix-valued functions over the whole base M.
In particular, if Œì¬µ are the matrices of the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection in
the tangent bundle over M, we obtain in this way the class of parallel transports
generated by such connections in this bundle (see (3.29) and the assertion after it).
It should be emphasized, the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
j¬µ of a given linear trans-
port L admitting them are deÔ¨Åned uniquely on U ‚äÜM by (6.3) or (6.2) if (and
only if) U is an open subset of M, e.g., if U = M; the same is valid for the trans-
formed coeÔ¨Écients (6.5). If U is not such, the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L contain an

252
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
arbitrariness connected with the one of the matrix-valued function F , appearing
in (6.3), which is subjected only on the condition F |U = F 0. Besides, if (6.1) holds
for some Œì¬µ, it remains true if we replace in its right-hand side Œì¬µ with Œì¬µ + G¬µ
where the matrix-valued functions G¬µ are such that G¬µ(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(s) = 0 for all C1
paths Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU and s ‚ààJ. The mentioned arbitrariness will be described below
when U is a submanifold of M.
Now we are going to Ô¨Ånd an analogue of Theorem 6.1 when the neighborhood
U ‚äÜM in it is replaced with a submanifold of the base M.
Let N be a submanifold of M and L a linear transport along paths in
(E, œÄ, M) which is Euclidean on N. Let the C1 matrix-valued function F 0 deter-
mines the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrix of L via (5.4‚Ä≤). Suppose p0 ‚ààN and (V, x) is a chart
of M such that V ‚àãp0 and the local coordinates of every p ‚ààN ‚à©V are x(p) =
(x1(p), . . . , xdim N(p), tdim N+1
0
, . . . , tdim M
0
), where tœÅ
0, œÅ = dim N + 1, . . . , dim M,
are constant numbers (see the deÔ¨Ånition of a submanifold on page 7).
In the chart (V, x), we have dF 0(Œ≥(s))
ds
= dim N
Œ±=1
‚àÇF 0
‚àÇxŒ±
			
Œ≥(s) ÀôŒ≥Œ±(s), with Œ≥¬µ :=
x¬µ ‚ó¶Œ≥, for every C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN and s ‚ààJ. From here and (5.4‚Ä≤), it follows
that (6.1) holds for
ŒìŒ±(p) = F ‚àí1
0 (p)‚àÇF 0
‚àÇxŒ±
			
p,
Œ± = 1, . . . , dim N
(6.12)
and arbitrary Œìdim N+1, . . . , Œìdim M since in the coordinates {x¬µ} is fulÔ¨Ålled Œ≥œÅ(s) =
tœÅ
0 = const and hence
ÀôŒ≥dim N+1 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = ÀôŒ≥dim M ‚â°0.
(6.13)
Comparing (6.12) with (6.2) for E¬µ =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ , we conclude that ŒìŒ±, given via (6.12),
are exactly the Ô¨Årst dim N of the matrices Œì¬µ = [Œìi
j¬µ] of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
of the transport L in the pair of frames

{ei},

‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ

. As we said, the rest of the
3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L (on N) are completely arbitrary. In particular, one can
choose them according to (6.3),
ŒìœÅ(p) = F ‚àí1(p) ‚àÇF
‚àÇxœÅ ,
œÅ = dim N + 1, . . . , dim M,
F |N = F 0,
(6.14)
which leads to the validity of (6.3) in every frame, or, if the representation (6.1)
holds for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM (this does not mean that L is Euclidean on M!), the
matrices ŒìœÅ can be identiÔ¨Åed with the ones appearing in (6.1) in the frame

‚àÇ

.
If {x‚Ä≤ ¬µ} are other coordinates on V like {x¬µ}, i.e., x‚Ä≤ œÅ(p) = const for p ‚àà
N ‚à©V and œÅ = dim N + 1, . . . , dim M, the change {x¬µ} ‚Üí{x‚Ä≤ ¬µ}, combined with

on N ‚à©V . So, equation (6.4) remains valid only for frames {E¬µ} normal on N.
But using the arbitrariness of ŒìœÅ, we can force (6.4) to hold on N for arbitrary
frames deÔ¨Åned on a neighborhood of N.
The above discussion implies that the condition (6.6) in Theorem 6.1, when
applied on a submanifold N, imposes restrictions on the transport L as well as
ones on the ‚Äòinessential‚Äô 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L, like ŒìœÅ above, or on the matrix-
valued function F entering in (6.3) or in (6.14). Since the restrictions of the last
type are not connected with the transport L, below we shall ‚Äòrepair‚Äô Theorem 6.1
on submanifolds in such a way as to exclude them from the Ô¨Ånal results.
Theorem 6.2. A linear transport L along paths is Euclidean on a submanifold
N of M if and only if in every frame {ei}, in the bundle space over N, the
matrix of its coeÔ¨Écients has a representation (6.1) along every C1 path in N
and, for every p0 ‚ààN and a chart (V, x) of M such that V ‚àãp0 and x(p) =

uniquely deÔ¨Åned via (6.12).
Remark 6.5. In the theory considered here, this result is a direct analogue of
Theorem III.8.1, point (i), on page 165.
Remark 6.6. It is intuitively clear, generally not all of the equations (6.16) are in-
dependent. One can expect only (dim N)[(dim N)‚àí1]/2 of them to be independent
because of R¬µŒΩ = ‚àíRŒΩ¬µ, due to (6.7).
Remark 6.7. This theorem is, in fact, a special case of Theorem 6.1: if in the latter
theorem we put U = N, restrict the transport L to the bundle (œÄ‚àí1(N), œÄ|N, N),
replace M with N, and notice that {x1, . . . , xdim N} provide an internal coordinate
system on N, we get the former one with EŒ± = ‚àÇ/‚àÇxŒ±. Because of the importance
of the result obtained, we call it ‚Äòtheorem‚Äô and present below its independent proof.
Proof. If L is Euclidean on N, equation (6.1) holds in every frame on N (Proposi-
tion 6.1); in particular it is valid in the frame

, induced by the chart (V, x), in
which, as was proved above, equation (6.12) is satisÔ¨Åed. The substitution of (6.12)
into (6.17) results in (6.16). Conversely, let (6.1) for Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN and (6.16) be
valid. By Lemma 6.1 with N for M, from (6.16) follows the existence of a rep-
resentation (6.12) for some matrix-valued function F 0 on N. Substituting (6.12)

into (6.1) and using that Œ≥ is a path in N and (6.13) is valid, in the frame

where F is a C1 matrix-valued function deÔ¨Åned on an open set containing N or
equal to it and such that F |N = F 0. Thus, by Theorem 5.2, the transport L is
Euclidean on N.
‚ñ°
Corollary 6.1. Every linear transport along paths in a vector bundle whose base
and bundle spaces are C1 manifolds, is Euclidean at every single point or along
every path without self-intersections.
Proof. See Theorem 6.2 for dim N = 0, 1, in which cases RN

It should be noted, the last result agrees completely with Proposition 5.1 and
Corollary 5.1.

Linear transports and normal frames in line bundles
The purpose of this section is to exemplify the above general considerations con-
cerning linear transports and normal frames on line vector bundles, i.e., ones with
one-dimensional Ô¨Åbres.
Let (E, œÄ, M) be one-dimensional vector bundle over a C1 manifold M. Thus
the (typical) Ô¨Åbre of (E, œÄ, M) can be identiÔ¨Åed with K and then the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(x)
over x ‚ààM will be an isomorphic image of K. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be of class C1 and L
be a linear transport along paths in (E, œÄ, M). A frame {e} along Œ≥ consists of a
single non-zero vector Ô¨Åeld e: (s; Œ≥) ‚Üíe(s; Œ≥) ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s))\{0}, s ‚ààJ, and in it the
matrix of LŒ≥ at (t, s) ‚ààJ √ó J is simply a number L(t, s; Œ≥) ‚ààK, LŒ≥
s‚Üít(ue(s; Œ≥)) =
uL(t, s; Œ≥)e(t; Œ≥) for u ‚ààK and s, t ‚ààJ. By Proposition 3.4, the general form
of L is
L(t, s; Œ≥) = f(s; Œ≥)
f(t; Œ≥)
(7.1)
where f : (s; Œ≥) ‚Üíf(s; Œ≥) ‚ààK\{0} is deÔ¨Åned up to (left) multiplication with a
function of Œ≥ (Proposition 3.5). Respectively, due to (3.25), the matrix of the
coeÔ¨Écient(s) of L is
Œì(s; Œ≥) = ‚àÇL(t, s; Œ≥)

(7.5)
where Œª ‚ààPLift1(E, œÄ, M) and (3.23) was used. Let us now look on the normal
frames on one-dimensional vector bundles.
A frame {e} is normal for L along Œ≥ (resp. on U) iÔ¨Äin that frame (7.1) holds
with
f(s; Œ≥) = f0(Œ≥)
(7.6)
where Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM (resp. Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU) and f0 : Œ≥ ‚Üíf0(Œ≥) ‚ààK\{0} (see Remark 4.2
and Proposition 4.1). Since, in a frame normal along Œ≥ (resp. on U), it is fulÔ¨Ålled
L(t, s; Œ≥) = 1,
Œì(s; Œ≥) = 0
(7.7)
for the given path Œ≥ (resp. every path in U), in every frame {e‚Ä≤ = ae}, we have
L‚Ä≤(t, s; Œ≥) = a(s; Œ≥)
a(t; Œ≥) ,
Œì‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) = d

ln(a(s; Œ≥)

(7.8)
In addition, for Euclidean on U ‚äÜM transport L, the representation
Œì‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) = Œì‚Ä≤
¬µ(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥‚Ä≤ ¬µ(s)
(7.9)
holds for every C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU and some Œì‚Ä≤
¬µ : V ‚ÜíK with V being an open
set such that V ‚äáU (Proposition 6.1). This means (see Theorems 5.1 and 5.2)
that (7.8) holds for
a(s; Œ≥) = a0(Œ≥(s)),
(7.10)
where a0 : U ‚ÜíK\{0}, and, consequently, the equality (7.9) can be satisÔ¨Åed if we
choose
Œì‚Ä≤
¬µ = E¬µ(a)
(7.11)

256
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
with a: V ‚ÜíK, a|U = a0 and {E¬µ} being a frame in the bundle space tangent
to M which, in particular, can be a coordinate one, E¬µ =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ . Of course, if U is
not an open set, this choice of Œì‚Ä≤
¬µ is not necessary (see Section 6); for example,
the equality (7.9) will be preserved, if to the right-hand side of (7.11) is added a
function G‚Ä≤
¬µ such that G‚Ä≤
¬µ ÀôŒ≥‚Ä≤ ¬µ = 0.
By virtue of (6.4), the functions Œì¬µ and Œì‚Ä≤
¬µ in two arbitrary pairs of frames
({e}, {E¬µ}) and ({e‚Ä≤ = ae}, {E‚Ä≤
¬µ = BŒΩ

(7.12)
and, consequently, with respect to changes of the frames in the tangent bundle
space over M, when a = 1, they behave like the components of a covariant vector
Ô¨Åeld (one-form). Therefore, on an open set U, e.g., U = M, the quantity
œâ = Œì¬µE¬µ,
(7.13)
where {E¬µ} is the coframe dual to {E¬µ} (in local coordinates: E¬µ =
‚àÇ
‚àÇs¬µ and
E¬µ = dx¬µ), is a 1-form over M (with respect to changes of the local coordinates on
M or of the frames in the (co)tangent bundle space over M). However, it depends
on the choice of the frame {e} in the bundle space E and a change e ‚Üíe‚Ä≤ = ae
implies
œâ ‚Üíœâ‚Ä≤ = œâ + (EŒΩ(ln a))EŒΩ = œâ + (E‚Ä≤
ŒΩ(ln a))E‚Ä≤ ŒΩ.
(7.14)
Using the 1-form (7.13), we see that
Œì(s; Œ≥) = œâ|Œ≥(s)(ÀôŒ≥(s))
(7.15)
and (7.3) can be rewritten as
L(t, s; Œ≥) = exp

‚àí


(7.16)
where the integration is along some path in U (on which the transport L is Eu-
clidean). Hence L (or L) depends only on the points Œ≥(s) and Œ≥(t), not on the par-
ticular path connecting them, as it should be (Theorem 5.1). The self-consistency
of our results is conÔ¨Årmed by the equation
R¬µŒΩ|U = 0
(7.17)
which is a consequence of (7.11) and (6.7) and which is a necessary and suÔ¨Écient
condition for the existence of frames normal on an open set U (Theorem 6.1).
We end this section with the remark that frames normal along injective paths
always exist (Corollary 5.1), but on an arbitrary submanifold N ‚äÜM they exist
iÔ¨Äthe functions Œì¬µ satisfy the conditions (6.16) with x ‚ààN in the coordinates
described in Theorem 6.2.

Normal frames for derivations in
vector bundles with a manifold as a base
For a general bundle (E, œÄ, B) whose bundle space E is C1 manifold, we call a
frame {ei} normal on U ‚äÜB (resp. along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM) for a derivation D along
paths (resp. DŒ≥ along Œ≥) (see DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1 on page 219) if {ei} is normal on
U (resp. along Œ≥) for the linear transport L along paths generating it by (3.19)
(see Proposition 3.7). We can also, equivalently, deÔ¨Åne a frame normal for D
(resp. DŒ≥) as one in which the components of D (resp. DŒ≥) vanish (see the proof
of Proposition 3.7, Proposition 4.2, and Corollary 4.2). A derivation admitting
normal frame(s) is called Euclidean.
In connection with concrete physical applications, far more interesting case
is the case of a bundle (E, œÄ, M) with a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold M as a base. The
cause for this is the existence of natural structures over M, e.g., the diÔ¨Äerent tensor
bundles and the tensor algebra over it. Below we concentrate on this particular
case.
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.1. A derivation over an open set V ‚äÜM or in (E, œÄ, M)|V along
tangent vector Ô¨Åelds is a mapping D assigning to every tangent vector Ô¨Åeld X over
V a K-linear mapping
DX : Sec1
(E, œÄ, M)|V

‚ÜíSec0
(E, œÄ, M)|V

,
(8.1)
called a derivation along X, such that
DX(f ¬∑ œÉ) = X(f) ¬∑ œÉ + f ¬∑ DX(œÉ)
(8.2)
for every C1 section œÉ over V and every C1 function f : V ‚ÜíK.
Example 8.1. The mapping X ‚Üí‚àáX|Tr;1
s
(M), where ‚àáis a linear connection and
Tr;1
s (M) = Sec1(T r
s (M), œÄr
s, M) is the set of C1 tensor Ô¨Åelds of type (r, s) over M,
is a derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds in the tensor bundle (T r
s (M), œÄr
s, M) of
type (r, s).
Obviously (see DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1), if Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíV is a C1 path, the mapping D: ÀÜœÉ ‚Üí
DÀÜœÉ, with DÀÜœÉ : Œ≥ ‚ÜíD
Œ≥ÀÜœÉ, where D
Œ≥ÀÜœÉ : s ‚ÜíD
Œ≥
s ÀÜœÉ is deÔ¨Åned via
D
Œ≥
s(ÀÜœÉ) =

(DXœÉ)|X= ÀôŒ≥

(Œ≥(s)),
ÀÜœÉ : Œ≥ ‚ÜíœÉ ‚ó¶Œ≥,
(8.3)
is a derivation along paths on the set of C1 liftings generated by sections of
(E, œÄ, M)|V . From Section 2, we know that along paths without self-intersections
every derivation along paths generates a derivation of the sections of (E, œÄ, M)
(see (2.11) and (2.12)). Thus to any derivation D along (tangent) vector Ô¨Åelds on
V there corresponds, via (8.3), a natural derivation D along the paths in V on
the set of liftings generated by sections. These facts are a hint for the possibility
to introduce ‚Äònormal‚Äô frames for D. This can be done as follows.

258
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Let {ei} be a C1 frame in œÄ‚àí1(V ). We deÔ¨Åne the components or (2-index)
coeÔ¨Écients ŒìX
i
j : V ‚ÜíK of DX by the expansion (cf. (2.3))
DXei = ŒìX
j
i ej.
(8.4)
So ŒìX :=

ŒìX
j
i

is the matrix of DX in {ei}.
Applying (8.2) to œÉ = œÉiei and using the linearity of DX, we get the explicit
expression (cf. (3.23))
DX(œÉ) =

X(œÉi) + ŒìX
i
j œÉj
ei.
(8.5)
A simple veriÔ¨Åcation proves that the change {ei} ‚Üí{e‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iej}, with a
non-degenerate C1 matrix-valued function A =

Aj
i

, leads to (cf. (3.26))



(8.6)
where X(A) :=

X(Aj
i)

and the frames {ei} and {e‚Ä≤
i} (as well as A) are supposed
to be deÔ¨Åned on an open subset of M containing or equal to U (see Note 6.1).
Conversely, if a geometrical object with components ŒìX
i
j is given in a frame {ei}
and a change {ei} ‚Üí{e‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iej} implies the transformation (8.6), then there
exists a unique derivation along X, deÔ¨Åned via (8.5), whose components in {ei}
are exactly ŒìX
i
j (cf. Proposition 3.6).
Below, for the sake of simplicity, we take V = M, i.e., the derivations are
over the whole base M.
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.2. A frame {ei}, deÔ¨Åned on an open subset of M containing or equal
to a set U, is called normal for a derivation D along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds (resp.
for DX along a given tangent vector Ô¨Åeld X) on U if in {ei} the components of D
(resp. DX) vanish on U for every (resp. the given) tangent vector Ô¨Åeld X.
If D (resp. DX) admits frames normal on U ‚äÜM, we call it Euclidean on U.
A number of results, analogous to those of Sections 4‚Äì6, can be proved for such
derivations. Here we shall mention only a few of them.
Proposition 8.1 (cf. Theorem 5.2). A derivation D along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds
admits frame(s) normal on U ‚äÜM iÔ¨Äin every frame its matrix on U has the
form
ŒìX|U =

F ‚àí1X(F)
		
U
(8.7)
where F is a C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function deÔ¨Åned on an open set
containing U.
Proof. If {e‚Ä≤
i} is normal on U for D, then (8.7) with F = A‚àí1 follows from (8.6)
with Œì‚Ä≤
X|U = 0. Conversely, if (8.7) holds, then (8.6) with A = F ‚àí1 yields
Œì‚Ä≤
X|U = 0.

8. Vector bundles with a manifold as a base
259
Proposition 8.2 (cf. Corollary 4.5). The frames normal on U ‚äÜM for a Euclidean
derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds (resp. given vector Ô¨Åeld X) are connected by linear
transformations whose matrices A are constant (resp. X(A) = 0) on U.
Proof. The result is a consequence of (8.6) for ŒìX = Œì‚Ä≤
X = 0.
‚ñ°
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.3. A derivation D along (tangent) vector Ô¨Åelds is called linear on U
if in some (and hence in any) frame its components admit the representation
ŒìX
i
j(p) = Œìi
j¬µ(p)X¬µ(p)
or
ŒìX = Œì¬µX¬µ
(8.8)
where p ‚ààU, Œì¬µ =

Œìi
j¬µ(p)
dim œÄ‚àí1(p)
i,j=1
are matrix-valued functions on (a neighbor-
hood of) U, and X¬µ are the local components of a vector Ô¨Åeld X in some frame
{E¬µ} in the bundle space T (M) of the tangent bundle, X = X¬µE¬µ.
Remark 8.1. The invariant deÔ¨Ånition of a derivation linear on U is via the equation
DfX+gY = fDX + gDY
(8.9)
where f, g: U ‚ÜíK and X and Y are tangent vector Ô¨Åelds over U. But for the pur-
poses of this work the above deÔ¨Ånition is more suitable. Comparing DeÔ¨Ånitions 8.1
and 8.3 (see also (8.9)) with [23, p. 74, DeÔ¨Ånition 2.51] or with DeÔ¨Ånition 14.7 on
page 305, we see that a derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds is linear iÔ¨Äit is a
covariant derivative operator (covariant derivative) in (E, œÄ, B)|U. Therefore the
concepts linear derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds and covariant derivative op-
erator (covariant derivative) coincide.
We call Œìi
j¬µ 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of D or simply coeÔ¨Écients if there is no risk
of misunderstanding. It is trivial to check that under changes of the frames they
transform according to (6.5). It is easy to verify that to every linear derivation D
there corresponds a unique derivation along paths or linear transport along paths
whose 2-index coeÔ¨Écients are given via (6.1) with Œì¬µ :=

being the matrices
of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of D.1 Conversely, to any such transport or derivation
along paths there corresponds a unique linear derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds
with components ((2-index) coeÔ¨Écients) given by (8.8), i.e., with the same 3-index
coeÔ¨Écients. So, there is a bijective correspondence between the sets of linear deriva-
tions along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds and derivations (or linear transports) along paths
whose (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients admit the representation (6.1). It should be empha-
sized, if the above discussion is restricted to a subset U, i.e., only for paths lying en-
tirely in U, it remains valid iÔ¨ÄU is an open set in M. Otherwise, if U is not an open
set, the correspondence between derivations along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds and deriva-
tions or linear transports along paths via their 3-index coeÔ¨Écients is surjective in

cients of the derivations along paths are Ô¨Åxed, or/and to a single derivation along
paths may correspond diÔ¨Äerent derivations along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds, if the arbi-
trariness of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of the former derivations is taken into account.
This remark is important when the normal frames in the both cases are compared.
Proposition 8.3. A derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds is Euclidean on U iÔ¨Äit
is linear on U and, in every frame {ei} over U in the bundle space and every
frame {E¬µ} over U in the tangent bundle space over U, the matrices Œì¬µ of its
2-index coeÔ¨Écients have the form (6.3) for some non-degenerate C1 matrix-valued
function F on U.
Proof. The result is a corollary from Proposition 8.1 as X = X¬µE¬µ and (8.7)
imply (8.8) with Œì¬µ := [Œìi
j¬µ] = F ‚àí1E¬µ(F).

Theorem 8.1 (cf. Theorem 6.1). Frames normal on a neighborhood U for a deriva-
tion D along vector Ô¨Åelds exist iÔ¨Äit is linear on U and its 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
satisfy the conditions (6.6) on U.
Proof. By Proposition 8.3, a derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds is Euclidean iÔ¨Ä(6.3)
holds for some F which, according to Lemma 6.1, is equivalent to (6.6).
‚ñ°
Proposition 8.4 (cf. Proposition 6.2). A frame is normal on U ‚äÜM for some
linear derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds iÔ¨Äthe derivation‚Äôs 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
vanish on U.
Proof. This result is a corollary of DeÔ¨Ånition 8.2, equation (8.8) and the arbitrari-
ness of X in it.
‚ñ°
Remark 8.2. The arbitrariness of U in this Proposition does not contradict Remark
6.4 as the restriction of a derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds to (a neighborhood
of) U is along vector Ô¨Åelds X on U tangent to M, i.e., Xp ‚ààTp(M) with p‚ààU.
In this way we have proved the existence of a bijective mappings between the
sets of Euclidean derivations along paths and Euclidean linear transports along
paths. It is given via the (local) coincidence of their 3-index coeÔ¨Écients in some
(local) frames. Moreover, the normal frames for the corresponding objects of these
sets coincide. What concerns the frames normal for Euclidean derivations along
tangent vector Ô¨Åelds, in them, by Proposition 8.4, vanish not only their 2-index
coeÔ¨Écients, but also the 3-index ones. Hence the set of these frames is, generally,
a subset of the one of frames normal for derivations or linear transports along
paths. More details on frames in which the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of a derivations
or transport vanish will be presented in Section 12. These observations, combined
with Remark 8.1, are quite important because they allow in extenso transferring

in Section 14.

Curvature and normal frames
Until now the concept of a ‚Äòcurvature‚Äô, in connection with normal frames, appeared
several times in similar contexts. For the Ô¨Årst time, we met it in Section II.4: the
vanishment of the curvature (I.3.11) of a linear connection is a necessary and suÔ¨É-
cient condition for the existence of frames normal on a neighborhood for the linear
connection on it (Theorem II.4.1 on page 104). Next, the curvature of a linear con-
nection appeared in Theorem II.5.2, point (i), on page 120 for analogous result
on submanifolds. Similar results for arbitrary derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds on a
manifold are expressed by Theorems III.6.1, III.7.1, III.8.1, III.8.3, and III.8.4 in
which the curvature (III.2.12) of the derivation plays an essential role. One would
probably ask for the origin of the condition for (‚Äòpartial‚Äô) vanishment of the cur-
vature in all of these results. From algebraic view-point, this condition is nothing
else but the integrability condition for a system of partial diÔ¨Äerential equations
of Ô¨Årst order, the rigorous result being expressed by Lemma II.4.1 on page 105
(see, in particular, equation (II.4.6) in it).1 Alternatively, from geometrical point
of view, this means the path-independence of the parallel transport, generated
by a (suitable) linear connection, along paths in some set (see Lemma II.5.1 on
page 112 and equations (II.5.1‚Ä≤) on page 113 and (II.5.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤) on page 114).
All of the above-mentioned results have natural analogues in the theory of
frames normal for linear transports along paths (or derivations along paths or
along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds). Practically they were derived, in algebraic terms, in
Sections 5 and 6. To the reformulation of a part of the corresponding assertions,
employing the concept of a ‚Äòcurvature‚Äô, is devoted the present section.
9.1.
Curvature of linear transport or derivation along paths
Since there is a bijective correspondence between linear transports along paths and
derivations along paths (see Section 3), two equivalent ways for the introduction of
curvature can be pointed out. The algebraic approach is based on the consideration
of a ‚Äòcommutator‚Äô of two derivations along two diÔ¨Äerent paths passing through
one and the same point. Alternatively, in the geometrical approach, a vector is
transported along a closed path and the result of this transportation is investigated
when the path is contracted (tends) to a single point. Below we shall realize the
former approach as it is somewhat more direct and concise.
1From here the adjective ‚Äòintegrable‚Äô as a synonym for ‚ÄòÔ¨Çat‚Äô in connection with vanishing
curvature comes from.

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
The direct transferring of the concept of a ‚Äòcurvature‚Äô of a derivation along
vector Ô¨Åelds (of the tensor algebra over a manifold), introduced via (III.2.12) (see
also (I.3.11) in the particular case of linear connections), to derivations along paths
is impossible as, due to (2.1c), the derivative along a path of a lifting is not a lifting.
For the purpose is required a kind of derivation along paths which preserves the
type of the objects on which it acts. Without going into details, we notice that
the only derivation of this kind, introduce until now and having the property
mentioned, is the section-derivation along paths generated by a derivation along
paths and deÔ¨Åned via (2.11) and (2.12). Alternatively, the ‚Äòcommutator‚Äô of two
derivations along paths should be suitable deÔ¨Åned. Below we brieÔ¨Çy sketch these
approaches to the concept of a curvature of linear transports along paths.
Let D be a C1 derivation along paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, B), E being
C1 manifold, and D be the section-derivation generated by it (see page 221). Let
Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíB be an injective mapping, i.e., for every (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤ there does
not exist (s‚Ä≤, t‚Ä≤) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤ such that (s‚Ä≤, t‚Ä≤) Ã∏= (s, t) and Œ∑(s‚Ä≤, t‚Ä≤) = Œ∑(s, t).
The (section-)curvature (operator) along Œ∑ at (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤ of a C1 section-
derivation D along paths, generated by a C1 derivation D along paths, is a mapping
RŒ∑(s, t): Sec2

such that, for every (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤,
œÉ1(Œ∑(s, t)) :=

DŒ∑(s, ¬∑ )(œÉ|Œ∑(s,J‚Ä≤))

Œ≥ in Œ∑(J, J‚Ä≤).2
By deÔ¨Ånition, the action of the mapping (9.1) on œÉ is

RŒ∑(s, t)

(œÉ) :=

DŒ∑( ¬∑ ,t)(œÉ1|Œ∑(J,t))

every path Œ≥ in Œ∑(J, J‚Ä≤).
Symbolically, by abuse of the notation, one may write
RŒ∑(s, t) = DŒ∑( ¬∑ ,t) ‚ó¶DŒ∑(s, ¬∑ ) ‚àíDŒ∑(s, ¬∑ ) ‚ó¶DŒ∑( ¬∑ ,t)
but, as a consequence of (2.11), compositions like DŒ∑( ¬∑ ,t) ‚ó¶DŒ∑(s, ¬∑ ) are not quite
correctly deÔ¨Åned since the action of this expression on œÉ must be deÔ¨Åned as
DŒ∑( ¬∑ ,t)(œÉ1|Œ∑(J,t)).
2The index 1 (resp. 2) in œÉ1 (resp. œÉ1) reÔ¨Çects that in the right-hand side of its deÔ¨Ånition the
Ô¨Årst (resp. second) argument, i.e., s (resp. t), is Ô¨Åxed, i.e., considered as a parameter.

The explicit ‚Äòlocal‚Äô expression for the curvature RŒ∑(s, t) can be found by

Consequently the curvature RŒ∑(s, t) of a derivation D along paths is a linear

concept of a curvature of the linear connections.

linear transport has 2-index components, while only the ones of transports with
coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrix (9.11) have 4-index components. A straightforward calculation
shows that a change {ei} ‚Üí{e‚Ä≤ = Aj
iej} implies
RŒ∑(s, t) ‚ÜíR‚Ä≤ Œ∑(s, t) = A‚àí1(Œ∑(s, t)RŒ∑(s, t)A(Œ∑(s, t),
(9.15)
while its combination with {EŒ±} ‚Üí{E‚Ä≤
Œ± = BŒ≤
Œ±EŒ≤} leads to
RŒ±Œ≤ ‚ÜíR‚Ä≤
Œ±Œ≤ = B¬µ
Œ±BŒΩ
Œ≤A‚àí1R¬µŒΩA.
(9.16)
So, the 4-index components of the curvature of a transport/derivation for
which (9.11) holds, of which kind are the Euclidean transports or derivations, are
independent of the particular mapping Œ∑ by means of which they are deÔ¨Åned, while
the 2-index components depend on the point at which they are calculated and on
the tangent vectors to Œ∑ at it.
Proposition 9.2. Let (E, œÄ, M), E and M being C1 manifolds, be a vector bundle
and L be a linear transport along paths in it for which (9.11) holds for every path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU, U ‚äÜM. If dim M = 0, 1, then the curvature of L identically vanishes
on every U ‚äÜM.
Proof. See (9.13) for Œ± = Œ≤ = 1 (if dim M = 1) or remove the subscripts Œ± and Œ≤
(and put C¬µ = 0) in it (if dim M = 0).
‚ñ°
Example 9.1. A simple look over equations (9.13) on the preceding page and
(I.3.13) on page 26 reveals a striking similarity between them. Of course, this
is not accidental: if we take the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) for (E, œÄ, M) and
the covariant derivative along paths induced by some linear connection ‚àá(see

Section III.10) for D, then (9.11) holds for the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices Œì¬µ of ‚àáand,
consequently, the right hand sides of (9.13) and (I.3.13) coincide as now all indices
run from 1 to dim M and Œìi
jk are the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àá. We can express this result
by saying that the components of the curvature tensor of a linear connection ‚àáare
identical with the (4-index) components of the curvature of the parallel transport
or covariant derivative along paths generated by ‚àá.
Example 9.2. The result of Example 9.1 can be proved in a basis-free way as
follows. Let ‚àábe a linear connection on a manifold M, D be a derivation along
paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) with matrix (9.11) in some (every) frame in which Œì¬µ are
the matrices of the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àá, and A, B ‚ààX2(M). Suppose p ‚ààM and a C2
mapping Œ∑: J √óJ‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM be deÔ¨Åned by the equations Œ∑(s0, t0) = p, Œ∑‚Ä≤(s0, t0) = Ap,
and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s0, t0) = Bp for a Ô¨Åxed (s0, t0) ‚ààJ √óJ‚Ä≤. By means of (2.12), one can easily
prove that the section-derivation D generated by D is identical with the covariant
derivative along paths induced by ‚àá, D: Œ≥ ‚ÜíDŒ≥ = ‚àáÀôŒ≥ for every injective path Œ≥.
Applying this result and (9.2), we Ô¨Ånd
(RŒ∑(s0, t0))(X) = [(R‚àá(A, B))(X)]|p,
X ‚ààX(M)
(9.17)
where R‚àáis the curvature (operator) of ‚àá, given by the right-hand side of (I.3.11)
(see also (III.2.12) for D = ‚àá).
Exercise 9.2. Prove that, if D is a linear derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds of T 1(M)
(see DeÔ¨Ånition III.2.2 on page 145) and D is a derivation along paths in the
tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) for which (9.11) is valid with Œì¬µ given via (III.2.9)
(with k = ¬µ), then D: Œ≥ ‚ÜíDŒ≥ = D ÀôŒ≥ and
(RŒ∑(s0, t0))(X) = [(RD(A, B))(X)]|p,
X ‚ààX(M), p = Œ∑(s0, t0),
(9.18)
where RD is the curvature (operator) of D deÔ¨Åned via (III.2.12) and whose local
components are given by (III.2.14).5
DeÔ¨Ånition 9.3. A linear transport or derivation along paths is called Ô¨Çat, or curva-
ture free, or integrable (resp. on U) if its curvature vanishes on M (resp. on a set
U ‚äÜM), i.e., RŒ∑(s, t) = 0 for every Œ∑: J √óJ‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM (resp. for every Œ∑: J √óJ‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíU).
Remark 9.1. It should be emphasized on a principal diÔ¨Äerence between the Ô¨Çatness
on U ‚äÜB of a linear transport along paths in a bundle (E, œÄ, B) and of a linear
connection or derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds on a manifold M. In the former
case, the curvature is zero on U along mappings Œ∑ in U, i.e., Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíU, while
in the latter one it vanishes only along vectors tangent to U, i.e., from the tangent
space Tp(M), p ‚ààU. If (E, œÄ, B) = (T (M), œÄ, M) and U is a submanifold of M,
the Ô¨Årst case means that Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t), Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t) ‚ààTŒ∑(s,t)(U) ‚äÜTŒ∑(s,t)(M), while in the
second one, we have Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t), Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t) ‚ààTŒ∑(s,t)(M), i.e., Œ∑‚Ä≤ and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ are not generally
in the tangent bundle space over U of (T (U), œÄ, U).

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
9.2.
On the curvature of Euclidean transports along paths
The main result expressing the relation between curvature of and the frames nor-
mal for a linear transport along paths is the following one.
Theorem 9.1. Let (E, œÄ, B), E being C1 manifold, be a vector bundle, L be a linear
transport along paths in it, and U ‚äÜB. The transport L is Euclidean on U if and
only if it is Ô¨Çat on U, i.e., frames normal on U for L exist iÔ¨Äthe curvature of L
along mappings in U is identically zero.
Remark 9.2. In some sense, this theorem is the ‚Äòpeak‚Äô or ‚Äòsummit‚Äô of the series of
similar Theorems II.5.2, III.7.1, III.8.1, and 6.1 which are its special cases.
Proof. Necessity. If L is Euclidean on U, by DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1‚Ä≤ or Proposition 4.1, its
coeÔ¨Écients vanish in every frame normal on U, Œìi
j(r; Œ≥) ‚â°0 for every Œ≥ : J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíU
and r ‚ààJ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. Substituting this into equation (9.8) with Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíU, we get
RŒ∑(s, t) ‚â°0.
Sufficiency. According to the remark at the beginning of Section 5 (see the
paragraph containing equation (5.1) on page 240), we have to prove the existence
of solution of the normal frame equation
dA(Œ≥(s))
ds
+ Œì(s; Œ≥)A(Œ≥(s)) = 0
(9.19)
in a frame {ei} on U with respect to A: U ‚ÜíGL(dim œÄ‚àí1(p), K), p ‚ààB, for a Ô¨Çat
on U linear transport along every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU.
Let V := J √ó¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑√óJ (dim œÄ‚àí1(p)-times), œá: V ‚ÜíU, y ‚ààV , and the mappings

i(Œ≥(s))ej|Œ≥(s) is
normal along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU.
‚ñ°
Now we have at our disposal the machinery required to look on Theorems 6.1
on page 249 and 6.2 on page 253 from the view-point of transports‚Äô curvature. Let
(E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle whose bundle space and base are C1 manifolds and
U ‚äÜM. By Proposition 9.1, if the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrix of a linear transport along
paths has the form (9.11), the matrices of the 4-index components of the curvature
are (9.14) and consequently
R¬µŒΩ(‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M) = R¬µŒΩ
(9.20)
where R¬µŒΩ(¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ) are deÔ¨Åned by (6.7).7 From this equality, the conclusion can be
made that in Theorem 6.1 the condition (6.6) can, equivalently, be replace by
the Ô¨Çatness of the transport on U. Moreover, in this theorem the validity of the
representation (6.1) can be dropped: it follows either from the Euclidness of the
transport (Proposition 6.1) or from the Ô¨Çatness (as by Theorem 9.1 the Ô¨Çatness
implies the Euclidness). This completes the proof of the following assertion which
is a stronger version of Theorem 6.1.
Corollary 9.1. A linear transport along paths in vector bundle (E, œÄ, M), E and
M being C1 manifolds, is Euclidean on U ‚äÜM iÔ¨Äit is Ô¨Çat on U or, equivalently,
iÔ¨Äthe conditions (6.6) hold for p ‚ààU.
Corollary 9.2. Let (E, œÄ, M), E and M being C1 manifolds, be a vector bundle
and L be a linear transport along paths in it for which (9.11) holds for every path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU, U ‚äÜM. If dim M = 0, 1, then L is Euclidean on every set U ‚äÜM.
Proof. See Proposition 9.2 and Theorem 9.1.
‚ñ°
6Such a choice of œáy0
i0l is always (locally) possible; for the case when B is a C1 manifold, see
the paragraph containing equations (II.3.12) and (II.3.13).
7In the equality (9.20), we implicitly suppose that the matrix-valued functions Œì¬µ, entering
in (9.11) and deÔ¨Åning R¬µŒΩ via (9.14), are identical with the matrices of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
of the transport which appear in (6.1). If U is not a (dim M)-dimensional submanifold of M, in
this way we introduce in the deÔ¨Ånition of R¬µŒΩ an arbitrariness which is a consequence of the
one in the deÔ¨Ånition of Œì¬µ; for some details, see the discussion after Proposition 6.2.

270
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
The combination of the above results with the ones of Section 6 leads to a
necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for the Ô¨Çatness on U ‚äÜM of a linear transport
whose coeÔ¨Écient matrix has a representation (9.11) on U. At Ô¨Årst sight, one may
suppose L is Ô¨Çat on U iÔ¨Ä
R¬µŒΩ = 0
(9.21)
on U. But, as it is clear from (9.12), these equalities imply the Ô¨Çatness on U but the
opposite is generally not true unless U is a neighborhood, e.g., if U = M, or if on Œì¬µ
are imposed some additional conditions. Besides, as we know from Section 6, the
equations (9.21) do not concern solely the transport under consideration, but they
also imply some restrictions on the arbitrariness in the deÔ¨Ånition of the transport‚Äôs
3-index coeÔ¨Écients. The elimination of the last restrictions on a submanifold of
M from (9.21) leads to the following result.
Proposition 9.3. A linear transport L along paths in (E, œÄ, M) is Ô¨Çat on a sub-
manifold N of M if and only if for every p0 ‚ààN and a chart (V, x) of M such that
V ‚àãp0 and x(p) = (x1(p), . . . , xdim N(p), tdim N+1

are the Ô¨Årst dim N of the matrices of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L in the coordinate
frame

‚àÇx¬µ

in the tangent bundle space over N ‚à©V .
Proof. See Theorem 6.2 on page 253 and Theorem 9.1 or Corollary 9.1.
‚ñ°
The essence of Proposition 9.3 is that it provides a criterion for a Ô¨Çatness on a
submanifold of a linear transport along paths in terms of the 4-index components
of its curvature, if they exist.
An important consequence of Theorem 9.1 is that the combination of it and
any one of the necessary and suÔ¨Écient conditions or assertions for the existence of
normal frames derived in Sections 5 and 6 results in a corresponding criterion or as-
sertion, respectively, for Ô¨Çatness of a linear transport or derivation along paths. For
example, a transport is curvature free iÔ¨Äits action depends only on the initial and
Ô¨Ånal points of the transportation, not on the particular path connecting them (cf.
Theorem 5.1); along every Ô¨Åxed path every transport is Ô¨Çat (see Corollary 5.1), etc.
A simple corollary of Theorems 9.1 and 5.1 is the following important crite-
rion for path-independence of a linear transport along paths.
Corollary 9.3. Let L be a linear transport along paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, B)
and U ‚äÜB. The transport L is path-independent over U, i.e., along paths in U,
if and only if L is Ô¨Çat on U.
Proof. If L is path-independent over U, it is Euclidean on U(Theorem 5.1) and so
it is Ô¨Çat on U (Theorem 9.1). Conversely, if L is Ô¨Çat on U, it is Euclidean on U
(Theorem 9.1) and, consequently, it is path-independent over U (Theorem 5.1). ‚ñ°
In short, we can summarize the content of this section by stating that the sets
of Euclidean, Ô¨Çat, and path-independent linear transports along paths coincide.

Torsion and normal coordinates
In the preceding chapters, we have had a number of chances to see that, if frames
normal for a linear connection or derivation of the tensor algebra on a manifold
exist, then normal coordinates exist iÔ¨Äthe torsion of the connection or deriva-
tion, respectively, vanishes. Prima facie one can expect similar results for linear
transports or derivations along paths in vector bundles. But a simple look on the
corresponding deÔ¨Ånitions (I.3.12) and (III.2.13) of the torsion reveals a peculiarity
that can not be generalized to arbitrary vector bundles: they include the commuta-
tor of two tangent vector Ô¨Åelds and the action of a derivation along one of them on
the another one. These operations are primary related to the bundle (T (M), œÄ, M)
tangent to a manifold M and at present are not known suitable generalizations of
them for arbitrary vector bundles.1 Since it seems that the tangent bundles are
the only suÔ¨Éciently general and frequently used bundles for which the concept of
a ‚Äòtorsion‚Äô can be introduced, they will be considered below in the present section.
10.1.
Torsion of linear transport or derivation along paths
in the tangent bundle over a manifold
Let M be a C1 manifold and (T (M), œÄ, M) the bundle tangent to it. Suppose
Œ∑: J√óJ‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM is a C2 injective mapping. Denote by Œ∑‚Ä≤( ¬∑ , t) and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, ¬∑ ) for (s, t) ‚àà
J √ó J‚Ä≤ the vector Ô¨Åelds tangent to the paths Œ∑( ¬∑ , t): J ‚ÜíM and Œ∑(s, ¬∑ ): J‚Ä≤ ‚Üí
M, respectively. We consider Œ∑‚Ä≤ and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ as vector Ô¨Åelds on Œ∑(J, J‚Ä≤), Œ∑‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚àà
X(Œ∑(J, J‚Ä≤)) = Sec((T (M), œÄ, M)|Œ∑(J,J‚Ä≤)), such that
Œ∑‚Ä≤ : Œ∑(s, t) ‚ÜíŒ∑‚Ä≤
Œ∑(s,t) := Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t)
and
Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ : Œ∑(s, t) ‚ÜíŒ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
Œ∑(s,t) := Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t)
for every (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤.2
At last, if X ‚ààX(Œ∑(J, J‚Ä≤)), we denote with
ÀÜX a lifting of paths
ÀÜX ‚àà
PLift((T (M), œÄ, M)|Œ∑(J,J‚Ä≤)) such that for every path Œ≥ : J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíŒ∑(J, J‚Ä≤), we have
ÀÜX : Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜXŒ≥ ‚ààP(œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤))) with ÀÜXŒ≥ : r ‚ÜíÀÜXŒ≥(r) := X|Œ≥(r), r ‚ààJ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. In particu-
lar, the equalities ÀÜŒ∑‚Ä≤
Œ∑(s, ¬∑ )(t) = Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t) and ÀÜŒ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
Œ∑( ¬∑ ,t)(s) = Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t) are valid.
The torsion (vector) along Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM at (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤ of a derivation
D along paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) is called the vector
T Œ∑(s, t) :=

DŒ∑( ¬∑ ,t)(ÀÜŒ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤)

(s) ‚àí

DŒ∑(s, ¬∑ )(ÀÜŒ∑‚Ä≤)

(t) ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ∑(s, t)).
(10.1)
1The analogue of a derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds in a general vector bundle is the concept
of a derivation along paths but it acts on liftings of paths, (version: on sections (possibly along
paths)), not on paths or on the elements of the total bundle space. If the elements of the bundle
space are mappings (operators), under certain conditions, their commutator can be deÔ¨Åned, but
this is an exceptional case.
2This is possible as Œ∑ is supposed injective.

DeÔ¨Ånition 10.1. The torsion (vector) along Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíB at (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤ of
a linear transport along paths in the tangent bundle over a manifold is called the
torsion (vector) along Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíB at (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤ of the generated by it
via (3.19) derivation along paths.
DeÔ¨Ånition 10.2. The torsion (operator) of linear transports or derivations along

Proposition 10.1. If the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear transport along paths in the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) have on U ‚äÜM the representation (9.11) along every path Œ≥

3To derive this equality, calculate the commutator [Œ∑‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤] |Œ∑(s,t) in {Ei} and use [Œ∑‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤] = 0
as (Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t))(f) = ‚àÇf(Œ∑(s,t))

4One can at Ô¨Årst derive (10.4) in a coordinate frame and then, applying the corresponding
transformation laws, the result can be transformed into an arbitrary frame.

10. Torsion and normal coordinates
273
Lemma 10.1. The representation (9.11) on page 265 holds on U ‚äÜM, i.e., for
paths lying entirely in U, for some linear transport L along paths in the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) if and only if L along paths in U coincides with the parallel
transport generated by a linear connection.
Proof. If (9.11) holds, the matrices Œì¬µ transform according to (6.4) with B = A
(as now (E, œÄ, M) = (T (M), œÄ, M)) and, consequently (see (I.5.3)), they are coef-
Ô¨Åcients‚Äô matrices of a linear connection ‚àá. Therefore the derivation D along paths
generated by L coincides with the covariant derivative along paths generated by ‚àá.
Since the linear transport along paths generated by the last derivation is the par-
allel transport assigned to ‚àá(see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2 on page 27 and Proposition 3.7),
the last transport coincides with L.
Conversely, from deÔ¨Ånitions (I.3.18) and (I.3.17) follows that, for every par-
allel transport generated by a linear connection ‚àá, the representation (9.11) is
valid if in it Œì¬µ are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of ‚àá.

Lemma 10.1 explains the reason why in equation (10.5) appear the compo-
nents T i
jk of the torsion tensor of some linear connection with local coeÔ¨Écients
Œìi
jk (see (I.3.14)).
Example 10.1. The torsion tensor T ‚àáof a linear connection ‚àácan be introduced
by means of the torsion operator T of the assigned to it parallel transport or
covariant derivative along paths. Indeed, deÔ¨Åning the mapping Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM as
we did before equation (9.17), after a simple calculation, we Ô¨Ånd
T Œ∑p(s0, t0) =

T ‚àá(A, B)
		
p
(10.7)
where T ‚àáis exactly the torsion tensor of ‚àádeÔ¨Åned by (I.3.12) and with local
components (I.3.14), i.e., (10.6).
Example 10.2. If D is a linear derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds (see DeÔ¨Ånition III.2.2)
and D is a derivation along paths in the bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) tangent to M for
which (9.11) holds for the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices Œì¬µ of D, then the torsion of D
along Œ∑p at (s0, t0) is
T Œ∑p(s0, t0) =

T D(A, B)
		
p
(10.8)
with T D being the torsion of D given via (III.2.13) and with local components
given by (III.2.15).
DeÔ¨Ånition 10.3. A linear transport or derivation along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) is
called torsionless or torsion free (resp. on U ‚äÜM) if its torsion (operator) vanishes
on M (resp. on U).
Remark 10.1 (Cf. Remark 9.1 on page 267). It should be emphasized on a principal
diÔ¨Äerence between the torsionless on U ‚äÜB of a linear transport along paths in the
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) and of a linear connection or derivation along tangent vector
Ô¨Åelds on a manifold M. In the former case, the torsion is zero on U along mappings

274
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Œ∑ in U, i.e., Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíU, while in the latter one it vanishes only along vectors
tangent to U, i.e., from the tangent space Tp(M), p ‚ààU. If U is a submanifold
of M, the Ô¨Årst case means that Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t), Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t) ‚ààTŒ∑(s,t)(U) ‚äÜTŒ∑(s,t)(M), while
in the second one, we have Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t), Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t) ‚ààTŒ∑(s,t)(M), i.e., Œ∑‚Ä≤ and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ are not
generally in the tangent bundle space over U in (T (U), œÄ, U).
Proposition 10.2. A linear transport (resp. section-derivation) along paths in the
tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) is torsionless over a submanifold N of M, i.e., along
paths in N, if and only if its restriction to the bundle space T (N) := 
p‚ààN Tp(N)
(resp. to Sec1(T (N), œÄ|N, N)) coincides with the restriction to the same set of
the parallel transport (resp. covariant derivative) along paths in N generated by a
linear connection and which transport (resp. covariant derivative) is torsion free
on the mentioned set.
Proof. If D (resp. L) is a torsion free covariant derivative (resp. parallel transport)
along paths generated by a linear connection ‚àá, then, due to Lemma 10.1 (resp.
DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2 and (I.3.17)), its components (resp. coeÔ¨Écients) have locally the
representation (9.11) in which Œì¬µ are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of ‚àá. Therefore the
torsion of D (resp. L) is given via (10.5) which vanishes on N, by virtue of (10.6),
(10.7), and the torsionless of D (resp. L).
Conversely, let D (resp. L) be a section-derivation (resp. linear transport)
along paths which is torsion free on the tangent bundle (T (N), œÄ, N) over N.
At Ô¨Årst, we consider the case dim N = dim M.
Let Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíN, (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤, {Ei} be a frame on N, and Œìi
j be
the components of D (resp. the coeÔ¨Écients of L) in {Ei}. From (10.3) and (10.4)
follows that the torsionless is equivalent to
Œìi
j(s; Œ∑( ¬∑ , t))Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ j(s, t) = Œìi
j(t; Œ∑(s, ¬∑ ))Œ∑‚Ä≤ j(s, t) + Ci
jk(Œ∑(s, t))Œ∑‚Ä≤ j(s, t)Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ k(s, t).
Since Œ∑ is arbitrary, so are Œ∑‚Ä≤ and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ and, consequently, the last equation implies
the expansion5, 6
Œìi
j(r; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(r; Œ≥)ÀôŒ≥k(r),
r = s, t
and resp. Œ≥ = Œ∑( ¬∑ , t), Œ∑(s, ¬∑ )
for some functions Œìi
jk (generally non-symmetric in j and k) which do not depend
on ÀôŒ≥. Inserting this representation for Œìi
j into the last equation, we get
Œìi
kj(s; Œ∑( ¬∑ , t)) = Œìi
jk(t; Œ∑(s, ¬∑ )) + Ci
jk(Œ∑(s, t))
as Œ∑‚Ä≤ and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ are arbitrary. Using, once again, the arbitrariness of Œ∑, hereof follows
that Œìi
jk(r; Œ≥) must depend on the combination Œ≥(r), not on r and Œ≥ separately,
5From the diÔ¨Äerentiation of the last equality with respect to Œ∑‚Ä≤ i(s, t) or Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ i(s, t) follows the
below-written expansion for Œìi
j and the second derivative of the this equality with respect to
Œ∑‚Ä≤ i(s, t) and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ i(s, t) results in the equation presented after the expansion.
6Here and below the assumption that N is a neighborhood is essentially used as otherwise,
generally, from equality like Ai(t; Œ∑(s, ¬∑ ))Œ∑‚Ä≤ i(s, t) = 0 does not follow Ai(t; Œ∑(s, ¬∑ )) = 0.

10. Torsion and normal coordinates
275
i.e., Œìi
jk(r; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(r)). Therefore, we have:
Œìi
j(r; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(r))ÀôŒ≥k(r)
Œìi
kj(Œ≥(r)) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(r)) + Ci
jk(Œ≥(r))
for r = s, t and respectively Œ≥ = Œ∑( ¬∑ , t), Œ∑(s, ¬∑ ). Since Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíN is arbitrary,
the last two equations must hold for every path Œ≥ : J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíN. The former of these
equations, combined with Lemma 10.1, implies that D (resp. L) is on N a covariant
derivative (resp. parallel transport) along paths assigned to a linear connection ‚àá
(with local coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
jk) on N. From the latter equation, when substituted
into (10.6) or (I.3.14), follows that ‚àáand the assigned to it parallel transport are
torsionless on N.
Let now N be a submanifold of M of dimension dim N < dim M.
Note 10.1. The proof of the theorem can be completed by noticing that N is a
manifold by itself (as it is a submanifold of M ‚Äì see page 7) and, consequently,
to this case is valid the already proved theorem for dim N = dim M with N
for M. The reformulation of this observation in terms of submanifolds yields the
required result. The below-presented alternative and independent proof is consid-
erably longer but it reveals some features of the methods employed and parts of
it will be used later. If, at this point, this is not interesting for the reader, he/she
can skip the text after the present note till the end of this proof.
Suppose {Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi } is the coordinate frame associated to a local coordinate
system {xi} in a neighborhood of Œ∑(s, t) in M such that xi(q) = ai = const ‚ààK
for every i > dim N and q in a neighborhood of Œ∑(s, t) in N (see page 7). Then in
the above proof of the case with dim N = dim M one should put Œ∑‚Ä≤ i = Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ i = 0 for
i > dim N as the range of Œ∑ is in N. Taking this into account and repeating mutatis
mutandis the above lines, concerning the case dim N = dim M, we conclude that,
for every path Œ≥ : J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíN, is fulÔ¨Ålled
Œìi
j(r; Œ≥) = Œìi

j, k ‚â§dim N, i = 1, . . . , dim M, p ‚ààN
and for j, k > dim N the functions Œìi

since Œ≥ is a path in N, we have ÀôŒ≥k = 0 for k > dim N; besides, Ci
jk = 0 as
Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi .)
Let ‚àábe a linear connection on (a neighborhood of) N whose coeÔ¨Écients
on N in {Ei} are equal to the above functions Œìi
jk which for j, k > dim N are
arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed. Consider the restriction to Sec1(T (N), œÄ|N, N) of the covariant
derivative (resp. to T (N) of the parallel transport) along paths in N assigned to
‚àá. According to (I.3.17) (resp. DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2), it depends only on Œìi
j(r; Œ≥) =
Œìi
j(Œ≥(r)) with j ‚â§dim N when applied on tensor Ô¨Åelds (resp. tensors) over N as
a manifold, i.e., sections of the tangent bundle (T (N), œÄ|N, N) over N (resp. in

276

the bundle space T (N)). Hence, by construction, this restriction coincides with
the one to the same set of the initial section-derivation D (resp. linear transport
L) along paths. As a consequence of the last result, it is torsionless.
‚ñ°
Proposition 10.2 has an equivalent version which is more suitable for the
most applications.
Proposition 10.2‚Ä≤. Let L (resp. D) be a linear transport (resp. section-derivation)
along paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) over a C1 manifold M and N be a
submanifold of M. Then L (resp. D) is torsionless on N if and only if it coincides
on N, i.e., along paths in N, with the torsionless on N parallel transport (resp.
the torsionless on N covariant derivative) along paths assigned to some linear
connection (on (a neighborhood of ) N).
Proof. This proof is identical with the one of Proposition 10.2 till, but not includ-
ing, its last paragraph. It should be replace by the following text.
Let ‚àábe a linear connection on (a neighborhood of) N whose coeÔ¨Écients
Œì
i
jk on N in {Ei} are such that Œì
i
jk = Œìi
jk for j, k ‚â§dim N (Œìi
jk are the
same as above) and Œì
i
jk = 0 for j, k > dim N.7 Then the parallel transport (resp.
covariant derivative) along paths in N depends only on Œì
i
jk with j, k ‚â§dim N (see
DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2 (resp. (I.3.17))) and, by construction, it coincides with the initial
transport L (resp. section-derivation D), due to which it is torsion free on N.
‚ñ°
Remark 10.2. Having in mind Remarks 9.1 and 10.1, we want to emphasize on
the fact that the vanishment on U ‚äÜM of the curvature/torsion of the parallel
transport assigned to a linear connection ‚àá, generally, does not imply that ‚àá
is Ô¨Çat/torsionless. An exception is the case when U is a (dim M)-dimensional
submanifold of M.8
10.2.
Holonomic normal frames in the tangent bundle
The main purpose of this subsection is the proof of the below-presented theorem
whose meaning is that, in the tangent bundle over a manifold, the Ô¨Çat torsionless
parallel transports (resp. covariant derivatives) along paths generated by linear
connections are the only linear transports (resp. section-derivations) along paths
admitting normal coordinates, i.e., holonomic normal frames. Notice, here the
Ô¨Çatness is required for the existence of the normal frames (Theorem 9.1).
Theorem 10.1. Let L be an arbitrary linear transport along paths in the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) over a C3 manifold M and L be Ô¨Çat over a neighborhood
7The condition Œìi
jk = 0 for k > dim N is not necessary as Œìi
jk appear only in the combination
Œì
i
jk ÀôŒ≥k with Œ≥ in U, i.e., ÀôŒ≥k = 0 for k > dim N in the coordinates used.
8These assertions are clearly seen from Corollary 11.1 and Remark 11.3 below in a case U is
a submanifold of M.

U ‚äÜM. Holonomic on U frames normal for L on U exist if and only if L is
torsionless over U or, equivalently, iÔ¨ÄL coincides over U with the (Ô¨Çat and)
torsionless parallel transport assigned to a (Ô¨Çat and torsionless) linear connection
on U.
Proof. (i) It follows from Proposition 10.2‚Ä≤ and (9.17) that L is torsionless and
Ô¨Çat over (a submanifold, in particular neighborhood) U iÔ¨Äover U it coincides with
the parallel transport generated by a linear connection and which transport is Ô¨Çat
and torsion free on U.
(ii) If L admits a frame {Ei} which is holonomic and normal on U, i.e., such
that Ci
jk = 0 on (a neighborhood of) U and Œìi
j = 0 on U, equation (10.4) yields
T Œ∑(s, t) = 0 for every Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíU. Hence, by deÔ¨Ånition, L is torsionless on U.
(iii a) At last, let on T (U) the transport L coincides with the Ô¨Çat torsion-
less parallel transport generated by a linear connection ‚àá(on U).9 Then (see
Lemma 10.1) the coeÔ¨Écients of L are Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s), s ‚ààJ, for every
path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU with Œìi
jk being the coeÔ¨Écients of the mentioned linear connec-
tion. Therefore the curvature (resp. torsion) of L is given via (9.12) and (9.13)
(resp. (10.5) and (10.6)) with i, j, Œ±, Œ≤ = 1, . . . , dim M and the values of Œ∑ in U.
(iii b) Since L is Ô¨Çat on U, it is Euclidean on U (Theorem 9.1) and, by
Theorem 5.2, its coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrix on U in a frame {Ei} on U has the form
Œì(s; Œ≥) = F ‚àí1
0 (Œ≥(s)) dF 0(Œ≥(s))
ds
for some non-degenerate matrix-valued function
F 0 : U ‚ÜíGL(K, dim M) of class C1 and every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU. On U, we de-

page 27) that ‚àáis also Ô¨Çat and torsion free on U. Therefore, by Theorem II.4.3 on page 108,
‚àáadmits holonomic frames normal on U. As the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáand of the parallel
transport assigned to it coincide, this transport is also Euclidean on U and the (holonomic)
frames normal for it and ‚àáare identical. This completes the proof of the theorem. If the reader
is not interested from alternative proof and some other details, he/she can skip the rest of the
proof of Theorem 10.1, parts (iii b)‚Äì(iii d) below.

C‚Ä≤ i
jk(Œ∑(s, t))(Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t))‚Ä≤ j(Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t))‚Ä≤ k = 0
(10.10)
is valid for every Œ∑: J √óJ‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíU as a consequence of (10.9), (10.5), and T Œ∑(s, t) = 0
on U. Here (Œ∑‚Ä≤)‚Ä≤ i and (Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤)‚Ä≤ i are the components of Œ∑‚Ä≤ and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ in {E‚Ä≤
i}.
(iii c) Taking into account that U is a neighborhood in M (and hence it is
(dim M)-dimensional submanifold of M) and the arbitrariness of Œ∑ (which means
that Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t) and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t) are arbitrary vectors in TŒ∑(s,t)(M)), from equation (10.10),
we obtain C‚Ä≤ i
jk|U = 0, i.e., {E‚Ä≤
i} is holonomic on U.
(iii d) The proof is completed by the observation that the frame {E‚Ä≤
i =
(F ‚àí1

iEj} is normal on U. In fact, inserting the representation (5.4‚Ä≤) into the
transformation law (3.26) with A = F ‚àí1
0 , we Ô¨Ånd Œì‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥) = 0 for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU.
‚ñ°
In the above proof of Theorem 10.1, we intentionally have singled out its
several parts, (i)‚Äì(iii d), and the intermediate equations (10.9) and (10.10). A su-
perÔ¨Åcial look on them reveals that parts (ii)‚Äì(iii b) and (iii d) are valid for arbitrary
subset U ‚äÜM as the initial assumption on U to be a neighborhood in M was
not used in them. On the contrary, the conclusions in part (iii c) rely entirely on
the supposition that U is a neighborhood in M as otherwise from (10.10) one can
not, generally, infer the holonomicity of the frame {E‚Ä≤
i}, C‚Ä≤ i
jk = 0 on some open set
containing or equal to U: if U is not a neighborhood in M, then, generally, Œ∑‚Ä≤(s, t)
and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s, t) are in some proper subset of TŒ∑(s,t)(M) (see, e.g., Proposition 11.3 be-
low). The origin of this situation comes from the fact that the torsionlessness on
U ‚äÜM of the parallel transport generated by a linear connection ‚àáis, generally,
weaker condition than the torsionlessness of ‚àá: the latter one implies the former
but the former, generally, does not lead to the latter one. This conclusion is com-
pletely similar to an analogous result concerning the curvature on a submanifold
N of M of linear connections which is expressed by Lemma II.5.1 on page 112:
the path-independence on N in it is equivalent to the Ô¨Çatness of the transport on
U, so it is equivalent to (II.5.1), not to the Ô¨Çatness of the connection on N (cf.
Remark II.5.1). At the end, the conclusions in part (i) rest on Proposition 10.2‚Ä≤
which is valid if U is a submanifold of M, not only a neighborhood in it, but it
may not hold on an arbitrary its subset.
On the base of the above comments, we can formulate the next two proposi-
tions which are stronger variants of diÔ¨Äerent parts of Theorem 10.1.
Proposition 10.3. A linear transport along paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M)
is Ô¨Çat and torsionless on a submanifold N of M if and only if it coincides over
N with the parallel transport generated by a linear connection on (a neighborhood
of ) N which transport is Ô¨Çat and torsionless over N.
Exercise 10.1. Prove, independently of (10.9), that the frame {E‚Ä≤
i = (F ‚àí1
0 )j
i Ej} is normal for ‚àá
on U. (Notice, here is important the supposition U to be a neighborhood.)

10. Torsion and normal coordinates
279
Proof. See Proposition 10.2‚Ä≤ and (9.17)
‚ñ°
Proposition 10.4. If a linear transport along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) admits a frame
which is normal and holonomic on a set U ‚äÜM, then it is Ô¨Çat and torsion free
on U.
Proof. See part (ii) of the proof of Theorem 10.1.
‚ñ°
Proposition 10.5. Let L be a linear transport along paths in the tangent bundle
(T (M), œÄ, M). Let L be Ô¨Çat and torsionless over a neighborhood U in the manifold
M and the C1 non-degenerate matrix-valued function F 0 : U ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K)
generates the coeÔ¨Écients of L via (5.4‚Ä≤) in a frame {Ei} on U. Then:
(i) The frame {E‚Ä≤
i} with
E‚Ä≤

(10.11)
is holonomic and normal for L on U.
(ii) All frames normal for L on U are holonomic.
(iii) All frames which are holonomic and normal for L on U are obtainable from
{E‚Ä≤
i} by linear transformations with coeÔ¨Écients constant on U.
Proof. (i) See parts (iii b)‚Äì(iii d) of the proof of Theorem 10.1
(ii) According to Corollary 4.5 on page 239, all frames normal for L on U
are {E‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
i = Bj
i E‚Ä≤
j} with Bi
j|U = const. Hence these frames are holonomic on U,
[E‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
j , E‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
k] = 0, as the frame {E‚Ä≤
i} is such, [E‚Ä≤
j, E‚Ä≤
k] = 0.
(iii) This part of the assertion follows from part (ii) and Corollary 4.5.
‚ñ°
Remark 10.3. The non-degenerate matrix-valued function F 0, appearing in equa-
tion (10.11), is not arbitrary: since the transport L is assumed torsionless on U
and U is a neighborhood, from (6.3) (see Theorem 5.2) and (10.6)) follows that
the matrix elements (F 0)i
j of F 0 must be solutions of the system of equations

of (10.12) correspond to frames holonomic and normal for the linear connection
generating the parallel transport with which L coincides on U.
DeÔ¨Ånition 10.4. Let L (resp. D) be a linear transport (resp. derivation) along
paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) over a C1 manifold M. A chart (V, x)

dle (T (M), œÄ, M). Let L be Ô¨Çat and torsion free on a neighborhood U in M and

Exercise 10.2. Prove that the path-independence of the integral in (10.13) is a con-
sequence of the torsionless of L on U ‚äáV . (Cf. the proof of the path-independence
of the integrals in (II.5.14), or (II.5.3), or (11.13). For a rigorous proof, see (11.13)
below and the proof after it for A = BF ‚àí1
0 .)
Proposition 10.7. If L is torsionless linear transport along paths in the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) over a C1 real manifold M, then along every Ô¨Åxed injective
path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM exist holonomic frames (local coordinates) normal for L along Œ≥.
Proof. By Corollary 5.1 and Proposition 5.5, the transport L admits frames de-
Ô¨Åned solely along Œ≥ and normal along Œ≥. All of them, by Lemma III.10.1 on
page 194, can be extended in a holonomic way outside Œ≥(J).
‚ñ°
Here we shall stop the investigation of the holonomic frames normal for linear
transports along paths in the tangent bundle over a diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold. The
reason is that these problems, as well as any ones concerning such transports on
submanifolds, can be reduced to similar problems for parallel transports (assigned
to linear connections) or to linear connections over the same manifold (see Propo-
sition 10.3). Besides, the problems for existence and description of the holonomic
frames are solved by Proposition 10.5. The explicit description of the coordinates
normal on a neighborhood is provided by Proposition 10.6. A similar result on
arbitrary submanifolds will be derived in Subsection 11.2.
11.
Parallel transports in tangent bundles
The (Ô¨Çat and/or torsionless) parallel transports assigned to a linear connections
appeared several times in Section 10, when the theory of normal frames was con-
cerned. In the present section, we shall investigate the parallel transports (assigned
to linear connections) from the view-point of the general theory of linear trans-
ports along paths. In particular, we shall show that the parallel transports are
uniquely selected among the other transports along paths when normal frames are
involved.

11. Parallel transports in tangent bundles

11.1.
The parallel transport as a transport along paths
The concept of a ‚Äòparallel transport‚Äô, assigned to a linear connection over a man-
ifold M, was introduced by DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2 on page 27 in Subsection I.3.3 where
some essential its properties were mentioned. They are enough to be proved that
every parallel transport, when restricted to tensors of a Ô¨Åxed type, is a special kind
of a linear transport along paths in the corresponding tensor bundle over M. To
save some writing, below we shall investigate only the case of the tangent bundle
(T (M), œÄ, M) over a C1 manifold M but, mutatis mutandis (by adding additional
indices, e.g., replacing T (M) with T r
q (M)), the below-presented material can be
transferred on a tensor bundle (T r
q (M), œÄr
q, M) of arbitrary type (r, q) over M.
Let M be a C1 manifold, (T (M), œÄ, M) be the tangent bundle over it,
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be a C1 path, and P be the parallel transport assigned to a C0
linear connection ‚àáon M. As we know (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2), if a, b ‚ààJ and
a ‚â§b, then PŒ≥|[a,b]: TŒ≥(a)(M) ‚ÜíTŒ≥(b)(M) and PŒ≥|[a,b](X0) = XŒ≥(b) for every
X0 ‚ààTŒ≥(a)(M) and a vector Ô¨Åeld X (over Œ≥(J)) which is the solution of ‚àáÀôŒ≥X = 0
with XŒ≥(a) = X0. A simple analysis reveals that the only place, where the ordering
of the real numbers a and b, a ‚â§b, is used, is in the interval [a, b] in which, by
deÔ¨Ånition, its left end must be less than or equal to its right one. This restriction
in the deÔ¨Ånition of a parallel transport is, by our opinion, completely unnecessary
and can be removed by a suitable generalization or redeÔ¨Ånition of the concept of
a ‚Äòparallel transport‚Äô.
DeÔ¨Ånition 11.1. A parallel transport (along paths), assigned to a linear connection
‚àá, in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) is a mapping P : Œ≥ ‚ÜíP Œ≥, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM
being a C1 path, where P Œ≥, called parallel transport along Œ≥, maps every pair
(a, b) ‚ààJ √ó J into a mapping
P Œ≥
a‚Üíb : TŒ≥(a)(M) ‚ÜíTŒ≥(b)(M),
(11.1)
called parallel transport along Œ≥ from a to b, such that if X0 ‚ààTŒ≥(a)(M), then
P Œ≥
a‚Üíb(X0) = XŒ≥(b)
(11.2)
where X is a vector Ô¨Åeld over Œ≥(J) deÔ¨Åned as the unique solution of the initial-
value problem
‚àáÀôŒ≥X = 0
(11.3a)
XŒ≥(a) = X0.
(11.3b)
Remark 11.1. Recall (see Remark I.3.3 on page 28), the vector Ô¨Åeld X deÔ¨Åned
via (11.3) is generally multiple-valued at the points of self-intersection of Œ≥, if
any. To restore the single-valueness, one should consider X as a lifting of Œ≥ in
(T (M), œÄ, M), i.e., X : J ‚ÜíT (M) with œÄ ‚ó¶X = Œ≥; in this case it is better to
write XŒ≥ for X and XŒ≥(s) for XŒ≥(s), s ‚ààJ and the action of ‚àáÀôŒ≥ on XŒ≥ is given
by (I.3.19) which is in a full agreement with (2.4) and (2.16) (see also (III.10.5)
and Section 13).

282
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Comparing DeÔ¨Ånitions I.3.2 and 11.1, we see that the parallel transports P
and P, introduced by them, are equivalent in a sense that each of them can be
expressed through the other one:
P Œ≥
a‚Üíb =

PŒ≥|[a,b]
for a ‚â§b

PŒ≥|[b,a]‚àí1
for a ‚â•b
(11.4a)
PŒ≤ = P Œ≤
a‚Üíb
for Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM, a ‚â§b.
(11.4b)
Proposition 11.1. The parallel transport P, as deÔ¨Åned by DeÔ¨Ånition 11.1, is a
linear transport along paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M).
Proof. Due to DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 and (11.1), we have to check (3.2)‚Äì(3.4) with P for L,
which is almost trivial: the equality (3.2) is a simple consequence of the uniqueness
of the solutions of the initial-value problem (11.3) along Œ≥ written in terms of P,
equation (3.3) follows from (11.2) with b = a and (11.3b) as X0 is arbitrary, and
the linearity condition (3.4) is a result of the linearity of equation (11.3a) as ‚àáÀôŒ≥
is a linear operator (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1, points (ii) and (iii), or (I.3.17)).
‚ñ°
This quite simple result has two consequences which are important for us. On
one hand, the parallel transport (along paths and assigned to a linear connection)
provides a concrete and essential example of a linear transport along paths and,
on another hand, all results derived until now in the present chapter are valid for
the parallel transports (in the tensor bundles over a manifold).
Below, when talking about parallel transports, we shall have in mind the
ones introduced by DeÔ¨Ånition 11.1, not by DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.2. If there is a risk of
misunderstanding, we shall call such transports parallel transports along paths.1
It is well known, a parallel transport on a neighborhood U, i.e., along paths
in U, is path-independent iÔ¨Äthe generating it linear connection is Ô¨Çat on U.
Analogous result on arbitrary submanifold N of M is expressed by Lemma II.5.1
on page 112. Proposition 11.1 ensures the formulation of this important assertion
in internal terms, i.e., ones involving only parallel transports.
Proposition 11.2. Let N be a submanifold of a C3 manifold M. A C1 parallel
transport is path-independent over N, i.e., along C1 paths in N, if and only if it
(considered as a linear transport along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M)) is Ô¨Çat on N .
Proof. The result follows from Lemma II.5.1, Remark II.5.3 after its proof, and
equations (9.20) and (9.12).
‚ñ°
A little below (see Corollary 11.2), it will be proved the validity of Proposi-
tion 11.2 for arbitrary set U ‚äÜM, not only for submanifolds of M.
Proposition 11.3. The parallel transports in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) are
the only linear transports along C1 paths in this bundle whose coeÔ¨Écients have the

paths in diÔ¨Äerentiable bundles, the reader is referred to Section V.8.

representation
Œì(s; Œ≥) = Œìk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s)
(11.5)
in any frame.
Proof. This is a reformulation of Lemma 10.1 on page 273.
‚ñ°
Proposition 11.4. If P is a parallel transport along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) assigned
to a linear connection ‚àá, then the generated by it derivation along C1 paths D,
deÔ¨Åned via (3.19), is such that

DŒ≥( ÀÜX)

(s) = (‚àáÀôŒ≥X)|Œ≥(s)
(11.6)
where Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a C1 path, X ‚ààX(M), and ÀÜX ‚ààPLift1(T (M), œÄ, M) is
given by ÀÜX : Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜXŒ≥ : s ‚ÜíÀÜXŒ≥(s) := XŒ≥(s), s ‚ààJ. The section-derivation D
corresponding to D coincides with the covariant derivative along injective C1 paths
generated by ‚àá:
DŒ≥ = ‚àáÀôŒ≥
(11.7)
for every C1 path Œ≥ without self-intersections.
Proof. (Cf. the Ô¨Årst part of the proof of Lemma 10.1.) Since P is a parallel trans-
port, the equality (11.5) holds in a frame {Ei} (Proposition 11.3) and in any
other frame {E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj} the matrices Œì‚Ä≤
k are given by (6.4) with B = A := [Aj
i]
and ¬µ, ŒΩ = 1, . . . , dim M as now (E, œÄ, B) = (T (M), œÄ, M). Hence Œìk transform
according to (I.5.3), or (I.3.5) in components, which means that they are coeÔ¨É-
cients‚Äô matrices of a linear connection ‚àá. Since the covariant derivative assigned to
‚àáacts according to (I.3.17), in which exactly the components of (11.5) (see (11.5‚Ä≤)
below) appear, and the explicit action of DŒ≥
s is given by (3.23) with {Ei} for {ei},
we derive that DŒ≥
s ( ÀÜ
X) = (‚àáÀôŒ≥X)|Œ≥(s), i.e., (11.6) holds.
The equality (11.7) is a consequence of (11.6) and (2.12) for injective path Œ≥.
‚ñ°
At this point, we want to mention a corollary from Propositions 11.3 and 11.4
which is quite important in the theory of (linear) connections and parallel trans-
ports: on the base of these propositions, the concept of a parallel transport can be
deÔ¨Åned axiomatically, independently of the connection theory, and by its means the
notion of a (linear) connection can be introduced. For the purpose, DeÔ¨Ånitions 11.1
(or I.3.2) and I.3.1 should be replaced, respectively, by the following ones.
DeÔ¨Ånition 11.2. A parallel transport P along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) for a C1 man-
ifold M is a linear transport along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrix
of which has the representation (11.5) in some (and hence in any) frame.
DeÔ¨Ånition 11.3. A linear connection (resp. assigned to a parallel transport P) on
a manifold M (or in (T (M), œÄ, M)) is a mapping ‚àáassigning to every X ‚ààX(M)
a mapping ‚àáX : X1(M) ‚ÜíX0(M) such that
(‚àáX(Y ))|p := DŒ≥
s ( ÀÜY ),
Y ‚ààX1(M),
p ‚ààM
(11.8)

284
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
where D is the derivation along paths corresponding via (3.19) to some parallel
transport in (T (M), œÄ, M) (resp. to P), Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is the integral path of X
through p, Œ≥(s) = p for some s ‚ààJ, and ÀÜY : Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜYŒ≥ := Y ‚ó¶Œ≥.
Exercise 11.1. Prove that the mapping ‚àá, introduced via DeÔ¨Ånition 11.3, is in fact
a linear connection (restricted to the algebra of vector Ô¨Åelds over M) according to
DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1.
Exercise 11.2. Prove that the parallel transport assigned to a connection ‚àávia
DeÔ¨Ånition 11.1 (or I.3.2) coincides with the one generating ‚àávia (11.8).
Therefore we conclude that a linear connection (resp. parallel transport)
according to DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1 (resp. I.3.2) is such with respect to DeÔ¨Ånition 11.3
(resp. 11.2) and vice versa, i.e., both deÔ¨Ånitions are equivalent. Thus we have at our
disposal two equivalent approaches to the theory of linear connections and parallel
transports in which one of these objects is taken (and axiomatically deÔ¨Åned) as a
primitive one, while the other one is introduced on its base.
Proposition 11.5. In the representation (11.5) for the coeÔ¨Écient matrix of a parallel
transport, the matrices Œìk are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of the generating it linear
connection ‚àá, i.e., in components, we have
Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s)
(11.5‚Ä≤)
with Œìi
jk being the local coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àá.
Proof. In the proof of Proposition 11.4, we have demonstrated that Œìk are coeÔ¨É-
cients‚Äô matrices of a linear connection ‚àá. According to (3.23) and (2.3), the coef-
Ô¨Åcients of the parallel transport P assigned to ‚àácoincide with the components of
the derivation D along paths generated by P. Combining this result with (11.6)
for P and (I.3.17), we see that the coeÔ¨Écients of P coincide with the ones given
by (11.5‚Ä≤) for the initial parallel transport. Hence both transports are identical. ‚ñ°
Remark 11.2. This statement does not contradict to the arbitrariness in the 3-
index coeÔ¨Écients of a linear transport along paths discussed in Section 6 because
the 2-index coeÔ¨Écients of a parallel transport have the form (11.5‚Ä≤) on any subset
U ‚äÜM, i.e., for Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU, with Œìi
jk being the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àá.
Proposition 11.6. In an arbitrary frame {Ei}, the curvature and torsion of a par-
allel transport along paths are
RŒ∑(s, t) = [(R(Œ∑‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤)Ej) ‚äóEj]|Œ∑(s,t)
(11.9)
T Œ∑(s, t) = [T (Œ∑‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤)]|Œ∑(s,t)
(11.10)
where Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM, (s, t) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤, Ej := (Ej)‚àóis the dual of Ej, and R and
T , given via (I.3.11) and (I.3.12), are respectively the curvature and torsion of the
linear connection generating the parallel transport.

11. Parallel transports in tangent bundles
285
Proof. See (9.17) and (10.7), or Propositions 9.1 and 10.1 and use Proposition 11.5,
(I.3.13) and (I.3.14).
‚ñ°
Corollary 11.1. A parallel transport is Ô¨Çat or torsionless on a submanifold N of
M iÔ¨Ä, respectively,
R(X, Y ) = 0
for X, Y ‚ààSec(T (N), œÄ|N, N)
(11.11)
T (X, Y ) = 0
for X, Y ‚ààSec(T (N), œÄ|N, N)
(11.12)
with R and T being respectively the curvature and torsion of the linear connection
generating the initial parallel transport.
Proof. See Proposition 11.6 for Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíN and use the arbitrariness of Œ∑. ‚ñ°
Remark 11.3 (Cf. Remarks 9.1 and 10.1). If the dimension of the submanifold N is
less than the one of M, dim N < dim M, then from R(X, Y ) = 0 or T (X, Y ) = 0
one can not conclude that R = 0 or T = 0, respectively, as, for vector Ô¨Åelds
A, B in [Sec(T (M), œÄ, M)]\[Sec(T (N), œÄ|N, N)] Ã∏= ‚àÖ, the equality R(A, B) = 0 or
T (A, B) = 0 may not hold. Therefore one should make a clear distinction between
Ô¨Çatness/torsionless of a parallel transport and of the linear connection generating
it: the latter implies the former one, but the opposite is, generally, not true.
11.2.
Normal frames for parallel transports along paths
First of all, applying Theorems 9.1 and 5.1 for a parallel transport in the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) over a C1 manifold M, we obtain, respectively, the following
two propositions.
Proposition 11.7. A parallel transport is Euclidean on a set U ‚äÜM, i.e., admits
frames normal along C1 paths in U, if and only if it is Ô¨Çat on U.
Proposition 11.8. A parallel transport is Euclidean on a set U ‚äÜM iÔ¨Äit is path-
independent on U, i.e., its action along paths in U depends only on the initial and
Ô¨Ånal points of the transportation, not on the particular C1 path in U connecting
them.
Combining these assertions, we derive the following generalization of Propo-
sition 11.2.
Corollary 11.2. A parallel transport is path-independent over a set U ‚äÜM iÔ¨Äit is
Ô¨Çat on U.
Alternatively, this result follows from Corollary 9.3 with (T (M), œÄ, M) for
(E, œÄ, B) and a parallel transport for L.
Proposition 11.9. A parallel transport P is Euclidean on a submanifold N of a
C1 manifold M if and only if the generating it linear connection ‚àáis Euclidean
on N.

286
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Remark 11.4. This is untrivial result as (11.5) for Œì(s; Œ≥) = 0 with Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN
does not imply Œìk = 0 if dim N < dim M.
Proof. The transport P is Euclidean on N iÔ¨Äit is path-independent on N (Propo-
sition 11.8) a criterion for which is the fulÔ¨Ållment of (II.5.1) with R being the
curvature of ‚àá(Lemma II.5.1 on page 112 or Corollary 11.1). By Theorem II.5.2,
point (i), on page 120, the last condition is a necessary and suÔ¨Écient one for the
existence of frames normal for ‚àáon N.
‚ñ°
Proposition 11.10. If a linear connection ‚àáadmits frames normal on a set U,
then all frames normal on U for ‚àáare also normal on U for the parallel transport
P assigned to ‚àá. If U is a neighborhood, the opposite statement is true too, i.e.,
a frame normal on a neighborhood U for P is normal on U for ‚àá, and hence on
a neighborhood the frames normal for P and ‚àáare identical.
Proof. The Ô¨Årst part of the assertion follows from Propositions 11.3 and 11.4 and
DeÔ¨Ånitions 4.1, 4.2 and I.5.1. The second part is a consequence of the same propo-
sitions and deÔ¨Ånitions combined with the remark that, if U is a neighborhood,
in (11.5) the vector ÀôŒ≥(s) is an arbitrary vector in TŒ≥(s)(M) and hence Œì|U = 0 is
equivalent to Œìk|U = 0.
‚ñ°
The statement opposite to the Ô¨Årst part of Proposition 11.10 is, generally not
true, i.e., in the general case not all, but only some, of the frames normal for a
parallel transport are also normal for the linear connection generating it. This is
clearly seen from (11.5) as well as from the (un)uniqueness Proposition I.5.2 and
Corollary 4.5. In fact, from these results follows that, if {Ei} and {E‚Ä≤
i} are frames
normal on U ‚äÜM for ‚àáor P resp., then E‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iEj where the matrix-valued
function A := [Aj
i], deÔ¨Åned on an open set containing U or equal to it or on U
resp., is such that A|U = const or (Ei(A))|U = 0 resp. Generally, the restriction
A|U = const is stronger than (Ei(A))|U = 0 and, consequently, the set of the
solutions of the equation A|U = const with respect to A is not greater than the
one of the (Ei(A))|U = 0.
Proposition 11.11. A linear transport along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) for a C1 man-
ifold M admits frames normal for it on U ‚äÜM if and only if it coincides on U
with some parallel transport which is Ô¨Çat on U.
Proof. The suÔ¨Éciency of the assertion is an obvious corollary of Proposition 11.7.
If a transport L in (T (M), œÄ, M) is Euclidean on U, it is Ô¨Çat on U (Theo-
rem 9.1) and the matrix of its coeÔ¨Écients has the form (9.11) on U in every frame
over U (Proposition 6.1). Therefore, by virtue of Lemma 10.1, the transport L
coincides over U with some parallel transport which is Ô¨Çat on U as L is such.
‚ñ°
The last proposition demonstrates the ‚Äòprivileged‚Äô place of the parallel trans-
ports amongst all linear transports along paths in the tangent bundle over a man-
ifold: they are the only ones which may admit normal frames, a necessary and

11. Parallel transports in tangent bundles
287
suÔ¨Écient condition for this being their Ô¨Çatness. Before going ahead with the nor-
mal frames, we want to prove an auxiliary statement which is a generalization
of Lemma II.5.2 on page 116 for transports along path in the tangent bundle
(T (M), œÄ, M), which, in fact, are parallel transports in it.
Lemma 11.1. Let L be a linear transport along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) for a C3
manifold M, N be a submanifold of M, and L be Ô¨Çat and torsionless on N.
Every frame {Ei} deÔ¨Åned on (resp. a neighborhood of ) N and L-transported on
N, i.e., Ei|Œ≥(t) = LŒ≥
s‚Üít(Ei|Œ≥(s)) for Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN and s, t ‚ààJ, can be expanded (resp.
redeÔ¨Åned) outside of N in a holonomic way, i.e., for every p0 ‚ààN there is a chart
(V, z) of M with V ‚àãp0 such that Ei| ¬ØV =
‚àÇ
‚àÇzi
		 ¬ØV , ¬ØV := V ‚à©N. If dim N = 0 or if
N is real and dim N = 1, the condition {Ei} to be L-transported is not necessary.
Remark 11.5. According to Proposition 4.1, points (i) and (vi), any frame L-
transported on a set U is normal on U for L and vice versa (see also DeÔ¨Åni-
tion 4.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤).
Proof. Since the proof of the assertion is practically identical with the one of
Lemma II.5.2 on page 116, we shall point below only the new place requiring addi-
tional study in order to be obtained the needed proof from the one of Lemma II.5.2.
The notation below is the same as in the proof of Lemma II.5.2.
To prove the lemma, deÔ¨Åne A := [Aj
i]: UN ‚ÜíGL(dim M, K) by the expansion
Ei|q =: Aj
i(q) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxj
		
q, q ‚ààUN, and simply repeat the proof of Lemma II.5.2 with A
for D.
The only new problem, arising in this way, is to be proved the path-inde-
pendence of the integral appearing in the deÔ¨Ånition of the looked for coordinate
functions zi, i.e., the integral in (see (II.5.4))
zi(p) = ai +

The conditions for this independence are

‚àÇx[a‚àÇxb]
		
UN = 0 with a and b running
from 1 to dim N as the integration is performed along some path in N. To verify
these equalities, we shall proceed as follows.
Since {Ei} is normal on N for L (Remark 11.5), every vector Ô¨Åeld Ei, con-
sidered as a lifting of paths according to (2.8), i.e., ÀÜEi : Œ≥ ‚Üí( ÀÜEi)Œ≥ : s ‚ÜíEi|Œ≥(s),
satisÔ¨Åes the equation DŒ≥ ÀÜEi = 0 with D being the derivation along paths gener-
ated by L (Proposition 5.6). Writing this equation in the coordinate frame

Proposition 11.12. Let U ‚äÜM, L be a linear transport along paths in the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄ, M), and L be Ô¨Çat on U. Then:
(i) If some frame normal for L on U is holonomic, then the transport L is
torsionless on U and coincides over U with some parallel transport which is
Ô¨Çat and torsionless on U.
(ii) If U is a submanifold of M and L is torsion free on U, then all frames normal
on U for L are holonomic or can be redeÔ¨Åned outside U (if U Ã∏= M) in such
a way that the redeÔ¨Åned frames turn to be holonomic on U.
Proof. (i) The result follows from Propositions 10.4 and 11.11.
(ii) Since all frames normal on U for L are L-transported on U (Remark 11.5),
by Lemma 11.1 they are holonomic on U or can be redeÔ¨Åned outside U so that
the redeÔ¨Åned frames are holonomic on U.

Corollary 11.3. A linear transport along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) admits holonomic
frame(s) normal on a submanifold N of M if and only if it coincides over N with
some parallel transport which is Ô¨Çat and torsionless on N.
Proof. See Proposition 11.12.
‚ñ°
Thus the moral is: the Ô¨Çat and torsion free parallel transports are the only
linear transports along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) admitting holonomic normal frames.
2If one does not want to use liftings of paths, the same result follows from DŒ≥Ei = 0 with Ei
considered as a basic vector Ô¨Åeld and DŒ≥ being the section-derivation corresponding to D along
injective path Œ≥.

Besides, all frames normal for such transports are holonomic or can be redeÔ¨Åned
to be such.
Since all frames normal for a given Ô¨Çat linear transport are described via
Propositions 4.3 and Corollary 4.4, in the torsionless case, the explicit description
of all local coordinates normal on a submanifold is given via (see (11.13) and the

Strong normal frames
Let M be a manifold and (T (M), œÄ, M) the tangent bundle over it. Let ‚àáand P
be, respectively, a linear connection on M and the parallel transport along paths
in (T (M), œÄ, M) generated by ‚àá(see (3.29) and the statement after it). Suppose
‚àáand P admit frames normal on a set U ‚äÜM. Here a natural question arises:
what are the links between both types of normal frames, the ones normal for ‚àá
on U and the ones normal for P on U?
Recall (see DeÔ¨Ånitions I.5.1 and 4.1‚Ä≤ and equation (11.5‚Ä≤)), if Œìi
jk are the
coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáin a frame {Ei}, the frame {Ei} is normal on U ‚äÜM for ‚àáor P
iÔ¨Ärespectively
Œìi
jk(p) = 0
(12.1)
Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s) = 0
(12.2)
for all p ‚ààU, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU, and s ‚ààJ.
Two simple but quite important conclusions can be made from these equali-
ties: (i) The frames normal for ‚àáare normal for P, the converse being generally
not valid, which is the main contents of Proposition 11.10, and (ii) in a frame
normal for ‚àávanish the 2-index as well as the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of P.
DeÔ¨Ånition 12.1. Let P be a parallel transport in (T (M), œÄ, M) and U ‚äÜM. A
frame {Ei}, deÔ¨Åned on an open set containing U, is called strong normal on U for
P if the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of P in {Ei} vanish on U. Respectively, {Ei} is strong
normal along g: Q ‚ÜíM if it is strong normal on g(Q).
Obviously, the set of frames strong normal on U for a parallel transport P
coincides with the set of frames normal for the linear connection ‚àágenerating P.

290
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
The above considerations can be generalized directly to linear transports for
which 3-index coeÔ¨Écients exist and are Ô¨Åxed.
DeÔ¨Ånition 12.2. Let E and M be C1 manifolds, U ‚äÜM, and (E, œÄ, M) be a vector
bundle over M. Let L (resp. D) be a linear transport (resp. derivation) along paths
in (E, œÄ, M) admitting 3-index coeÔ¨Écients on U which are supposed to be Ô¨Åxed,
i.e., its coeÔ¨Écient matrix is of the form
Œì(s; Œ≥) = Œì¬µ(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(s)
(12.3)
in every pair of frames {ei} in E and {E¬µ} in T (M) deÔ¨Åned on an open set
containing U or equal to it, where Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU is of class C1 and Œì¬µ := [Œìi
j¬µ] are
the (Ô¨Åxed) matrices of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L. A frame {ei}, deÔ¨Åned on an
open set containing U or equal to it, is called strong normal on U for L (resp. D),
if in the pair ({ei}, {E¬µ}) for some (and hence any) {E¬µ} the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
of L vanish on U. Respectively, {ei} is strong normal along g: Q ‚ÜíM if it is
strong normal on g(Q).
So, a frame {ei} is strong normal or normal on U if (cf. (12.1) and (12.2))
respectively
Œì¬µ(p) = 0
(12.4)
Œì(s; Œ≥) = Œì¬µ(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(s) = 0
(12.5)
for all p ‚ààU, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU, and s ‚ààJ. From these equations, is evident, a strong
normal frame is a normal one, the opposite being valid as an exception, e.g., if U is
a neighborhood. This situation is identical with the one for parallel transports in
(T (M), œÄ, M) which is a consequence of the fact that DeÔ¨Ånition 12.2 incorporates
DeÔ¨Ånition 12.1 as its obvious special case.
The main diÔ¨Äerence between the cases of parallel transports and arbitrary
linear transports along paths is that for the former the condition (12.3) holds
globally, i.e., for every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, for some uniquely Ô¨Åxed Œì¬µ, while for the
latter (12.3) is valid, generally, locally, i.e., for Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU with U ‚äÜM, and in
it Œì¬µ are Ô¨Åxed but are not uniquely deÔ¨Åned by the transport and may depend
on U (see Sections 6 and 11). The cause for this is that for a parallel transport,
equation (12.3) on M with uniquely deÔ¨Åned Œì¬µ follows from its deÔ¨Ånition, while if
for a given linear transport L this equation holds on U for some Œì¬µ, it is also true
if we replace Œì¬µ with Œì¬µ +G¬µ where the matrix-valued functions G¬µ are subjected
to the condition G¬µ ÀôŒ≥¬µ = 0 for every path Œ≥ in U. If U is an open set, then ÀôŒ≥(s)
is an arbitrary vector in TŒ≥(s)(M), which implies G¬µ|U = 0, i.e., in this case the
3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L are unique; just this is the case with a parallel transport
when U = M and its 3-index coeÔ¨Écients are Ô¨Åxed and, by deÔ¨Ånition, are equal to
the coeÔ¨Écients of the linear connection generating it.
If in DeÔ¨Ånition 12.2 one replaces D with a derivation D along tangent vector
Ô¨Åelds and (12.4) with (8.8), the deÔ¨Ånition of a frame strong normal on U for D

12. Strong normal frames
291
will be obtained. But, by Proposition 8.4, every frame normal on U for D is strong
normal on U for D and vice versa. Therefore the concepts of a ‚Äònormal frame‚Äô and
‚Äòstrong normal frame‚Äô, when applied to derivations along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds,
are identical. Returning to the considerations in Section 8, we see that frames
(strong) normal for a derivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds are strong normal for
some derivation or linear transport along paths and vice versa. For this reason,
below only strong normal frames for the latter objects will be investigated.
To make the situation easier and clearer, below the following problem will be
studied. Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle over a C1 manifold M, V ‚äÜM be an
open subset, U ‚äÜV , and L be a linear transport along paths in (E, œÄ, M) whose
coeÔ¨Écient matrix has the form (12.3) on V , i.e., for every C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíV .1
The problem to be investigated frames strong normal on U for L.
Let {ei} be a frame over V in E and {E¬µ} a frame over V in T (M). A frame
{e‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iej} over V in E is strong normal on U ‚äÜV if for some frame {E‚Ä≤
¬µ} over V
in T (M) is fulÔ¨Ålled Œì‚Ä≤
¬µ|U = 0 with Œì‚Ä≤
¬µ given by (6.4). Hence {e‚Ä≤
i} is strong normal
on U iÔ¨Äthe matrix-valued function A = [Aj
i] satisÔ¨Åes the (strong) normal frame
equation
(Œì¬µA + E¬µ(A))|U = 0
(12.6)
where Œì¬µ are the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of L in ({ei}, {E¬µ}). This equation,
describing the matrix A = [Aj
i] which provides a transition from an arbitrary to a
strong normal frame(s), is also a consequence of (5.1), (12.3), and the arbitrariness
of Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíV ‚äáU.
If on U exists a frame {ei} strong normal for L, then all frames {e‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iej}
which are normal or strong normal on U can easily be described: for the normal
frames, the matrix A = [Aj
i] must be constant on U (Corollary 4.5), A|U = 0, while
for the strong normal frames it must be such that E¬µ(A)|U = 0 for some (every)
frame {E¬µ} over U in T (M) (see Corollary III.3.1 or (12.6) with Œì¬µ|U = 0).2
Comparing equations (12.6) and (III.3.5) or (I.5.4), we see that they are iden-
tical with the only diÔ¨Äerence that the size of the square matrices Œì1, . . . , Œìdim M,
and A in (III.3.5) is dim M √ó dim M while in (12.6) it is v √ó v, where v is the
dimension of the vector bundle (E, œÄ, M), i.e., v = dim œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààM, which is
generally not equal to dim M. But this diÔ¨Äerence is completely insigniÔ¨Åcant from
the view-point of solving these equations (in a matrix form) or with respect to
the integrability conditions for them. Therefore all of the results of Chapter III
(or II) concerning the solution of the matrix diÔ¨Äerential equation (12.6) are (mu-
tatis mutandis) applicable to the investigation of the frames strong normal on a
set U ‚äÜM.
The transferring of results from Chapter III is so trivial that their explicit
reformulations makes a sense if one really needs the corresponding rigorous as-
1From here follows the existence of unique 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L on V which, under a
change of frames, transform into (6.5). We suppose the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of L on U to be Ô¨Åxed
and equal to the ones on V when restricted to U.
2This conclusions agree with the discussion after the proof of Proposition 11.10.

292
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
sertions for some concrete purpose. For this reason, we describe below brieÔ¨Çy the
general situation and one its corollary.
The only peculiarity one must have in mind, when such transferring is carried
out, consist in the observation that in this way can be obtained, generally, only
part of the frames normal for some linear transport, viz. the frames strong normal
for it. But such a state of aÔ¨Äairs is not a trouble as we need a single normal frame
to construct all of them by means of Corollary 4.5.
Let n ‚ààN, Jn be a neighborhood in Rn, and Œ≥n : Jn ‚ÜíM be a C1 locally
injective mapping. Then, from Theorem III.8.1 and Proposition III.8.1, we derive
the following theorem.
Theorem 12.1. A necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for the existence of frame(s)
strong normal on Œ≥n(Jn) for some linear transport along paths or derivation along
paths or along vector Ô¨Åelds tangent to M, is its (3-index) coeÔ¨Écients to satisfy, in
some neighborhood (in Rn) of every s ‚ààJn, the equations

R¬µŒΩ(‚àíŒì1 ‚ó¶Œ≥n, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M ‚ó¶Œ≥n)

(s) = 0,
¬µ, ŒΩ = 1, . . . , n
(12.7)
where R¬µŒΩ are given via (6.7) for x¬µ = s¬µ, ¬µ, ŒΩ = 1, . . . , n with {s¬µ} being Carte-
sian coordinates in Rn.
It is almost evident, in the coordinates used, equation (12.7) is identical
with (6.16) for N = Œ≥n(Jn) and p = Œ≥n(s). Thus, on a submanifold or along
locally injective mappings, the existence of normal frames (for linear transports of
the considered type) implies the existence of strong normal frames.
From (12.7), an immediate observation follows: strong normal frames always
exist at every point (n = 0) or/and along every locally injective path (n = 1).
Besides, these are the only cases when strong normal frames always exist because
for them (12.7) is identically valid. On submanifolds with dimension greater than
or equal to two normal frames exist only as an exception if (and only if) (12.7)
holds. Notice, equations (12.7) express the Ô¨Çatness of the corresponding linear
transports (see Section 9, equation (9.14), or Corollary 9.1) or, if n = dim M,
derivations (see Section III.2).
13.
Linear transports assigned to
derivations in tangent bundles
Since the linear connections are a special kind of derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds
(see Section III.2), one can expect a possible existence of linear transports along
paths whose relation to the derivations is similar to the one between parallel
transports and linear connections (see Subsection 11.1). Below we shall see that
such an expectation has a Ô¨Årm background. The aim of the present section is to be
clariÔ¨Åed the links between the diÔ¨Äerent derivations of the algebra of vector Ô¨Åelds
over a manifold M and the linear transports along paths in the tangent bundle

13. Linear transports in tangent bundles
293
(T (M), œÄ, M) over M. The next ideas and results have a natural generalization
in the case of arbitrary tensor bundles (or the algebraic tensor bundle) over M
which we leave to the reader.
13.1.
Derivations along paths
Since the DeÔ¨Ånition 11.1 on page 281 of a parallel transport employs only the
covariant derivative along paths assigned to a linear connection, not directly the
connection, it can mutatis mutandis be transferred to arbitrary derivations along
paths. On this base most of the material in Section 11 could be suitably general-
ized. Here are some details of this procedure.
Let M be a C1 manifold, D be a derivation along (injective C1) paths of the
tensor algebra over M (see DeÔ¨Ånition III.10.1 on page 191), and Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be
injective and of class C1. DeÔ¨Åne a mapping L on the set P1(M) of C1 paths in
M, L: Œ≥ ‚ÜíLŒ≥, such that
LŒ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíLŒ≥
s‚Üít : TŒ≥(s)(M) ‚ÜíTŒ≥(t)(M)
(13.1)
for s, t ‚ààJ and
LŒ≥
s‚Üít(X0) = XŒ≥(t),
X0 ‚ààTŒ≥(s)(M)
(13.2)
where the vector Ô¨Åeld X over Œ≥(J) is the unique solution of the initial-value prob-
lem
DŒ≥X = 0
(13.3a)
XŒ≥(s) = X0.
(13.3b)
Proposition 13.1. The mapping L: Œ≥ ‚ÜíLŒ≥, deÔ¨Åned via (13.1)‚Äì(13.3), is a linear
transport along paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) over the manifold M.
Proof. Take into account (III.10.7) and repeat the proof of Proposition 11.1 with
L for P and DŒ≥ for ‚àáÀôŒ≥.
‚ñ°
DeÔ¨Ånition 13.1. The linear transport L along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M), deÔ¨Åned via
equations (13.1)‚Äì(13.3), will be called transport assigned to or generated by the
derivation D along paths (of T 1(M) or of T (M)).
On the base of (13.1)‚Äì(13.3), one can prove a number of properties of the
transport L assigned to D, e.g., Proposition 11.4 holds with L for P, D for the
linear connection ‚àá, and DŒ≥ for ‚àáÀôŒ≥. But such eÔ¨Äorts, for deriving the properties
of L using only (13.1)‚Äì(13.3), are practically completely needless and the result of
them will be only new ways for derivation or proving the properties of the general
linear transports in (T (M), œÄ, M). The cause for this situation is that the afore-
presented deÔ¨Ånitions of a linear transport (along injective C1 paths) assigned to
a derivation along paths is simply an equivalent way for deÔ¨Åning what a linear
transport (along injective C1 paths) in the tangent bundle is.

294
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
The above assertion can be proved, most easily, in some local frame {Ei} on
(a neighborhood of) Œ≥(J) for an arbitrary injective C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM.
Comparing the local expansions (III.10.7) on page 192 for (r, q) = (1, 0)
and (2.13) on page 221 for ei(s; Œ≥) = Ei|Œ≥(s) and œÉ = K, we see that they are
identical for every vector Ô¨Åeld K deÔ¨Åned on Œ≥(J) (or on a larger set). Therefore a
derivation along paths according to DeÔ¨Ånition III.10.1, when restricted to vector
Ô¨Åelds, is in fact a section-derivation along paths in the tangent bundle, according to
the deÔ¨Ånition of the latter one on page 221, assigned to a derivation D along paths
in (T (M), œÄ, M) (see DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1) whose local components Œìi
j along Œ≥ coincide
with the functions Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) appearing in (III.10.7). For this reason, further the
derivations along paths of the algebra of C1 vector Ô¨Åelds over M will be called
vector-derivations along paths. Thus we have proved the following result.
Proposition 13.2. For every vector-derivation D along paths of the algebra of vector
Ô¨Åelds over a manifold M, there exists a unique derivation D along paths in the
tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) over M which generates it via (2.12). In a local
frame, D is explicitly deÔ¨Åned via its local components which coincide with the ones
of D.
Remark 13.1. The components of D are deÔ¨Åned along injective paths, but this is in-
signiÔ¨Åcant for D which is deÔ¨Åned along arbitrary, with or without self-intersections,
paths.
Denoting, in some frame {Ei}, by L(t, s; Œ≥) the matrix of the transport
L assigned to a vector-derivation D along paths, from equations (13.2), (13.3),
and (III.10.7), we derive that it is the unique solution of the initial-value problem
‚àÇL(t, s; Œ≥)
‚àÇt
= ‚àíŒì(t; Œ≥)L(t, s; Œ≥)
(13.4a)
L(s, s; Œ≥) = 1
(13.4b)
where s, t ‚ààJ and Œì := [Œìi
j] is the matrix of the components of D (or of D) in
{Ei}. So the explicit form of L is
L(t, s; Œ≥) = Y (t, s0; ‚àíŒì( ¬∑ ; Œ≥))Y ‚àí1(s, s0; ‚àíŒì( ¬∑ ; Œ≥))
(13.5)
where Y is deÔ¨Åned via (3.28) and s0 ‚ààJ is Ô¨Åxed.
At last, noticing that (13.5) is identical with (3.27), we conclude from Propo-
sition 3.6 that L is identical with the linear transport along paths generating D
via (3.19) and whose coeÔ¨Écients coincide with the components of D (or of D).
This result completes the proof of our statement that a linear transport along
paths assigned to a vector-derivation is simply a linear transport along injective
C1 paths in the tangent bundle and vice versa.

13. Linear transports in tangent bundles
295
13.2.
Derivations along vector Ô¨Åelds
From Section III.10, we know that to every derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds whose
matrix in some (and hence in every ‚Äì see (III.2.11)) frame {Ei} satisÔ¨Åes the con-
dition
ŒìX(Œ≥(s))|XŒ≥(s)= ÀôŒ≥(s) = Œì(s; Œ≥)
(13.6)
for every (injective) C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM and s ‚ààJ, there corresponds a vector-
derivation D along paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) such that (see (III.10.2))
(DŒ≥V )(Œ≥(s)) =
dV i(Œ≥(s))
ds
+ Œìi
j(s; Œ≥)V j
Œ≥(s)

Ei|Œ≥(s)
(13.7)
for V ‚ààX1(M).
Example 13.1. A kind of vector-derivation is the covariant derivative assigned to
a linear connection ‚àáfor which
ŒìX(p) = Œìk(p)Xk
p ,
(13.8)
where p ‚ààM and Œìk are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of ‚àá. In this case, obviously,
equation (13.6) holds with
Œì(s; Œ≥) = Œìk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s).
(13.9)
Since to a vector-derivation along paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M)
there corresponds unique linear transport along paths in the same bundle (see
Subsection 13.1), to every derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds of T (M), whose com-
ponents‚Äô matrix satisÔ¨Åes the condition (13.6), there corresponds a linear transport
along paths generating the assigned to D vector-derivation D via (3.19) and (2.12).
So, the general scheme for generating a linear transport from a derivation
along vector Ô¨Åelds is
derivation along vector Ô¨Åelds satisfying (13.6)
‚Üívector-derivation along paths
‚Üílinear transport along paths.
(13.10)
A typical example, realizing this procedure, is the parallel transport assigned to a
linear connection. A modiÔ¨Åcation of the scheme (13.10) for derivations along Ô¨Åxed
vector Ô¨Åelds will be developed in the next subsection .
13.3.
Derivations along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld
In the present subsection, we want to apply (possibly a modiÔ¨Åcation of) the
scheme (13.10) to a derivation DX along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X of the tensor
algebra over a manifold M. Of course, such a derivation can not deÔ¨Åne a linear

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
transport along arbitrary (C1) paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) since X is Ô¨Åxed, not ar-
bitrary, vector Ô¨Åeld and hence (13.6) cannot hold for arbitrary path Œ≥.1 As one
could expect, the transports corresponding to DX are along the integral paths of
X. Except this peculiarity, the other general considerations in Subsection 13.2 pre-
ceding (13.10) remain unchanged. Here are some details of the procedure assigning
a linear transport to a derivation along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld.
Let X ‚ààX1(M) be Ô¨Åxed and non-singular, X Ã∏= 0. Let Œ≥p : J ‚ÜíM be
the integral path of X through p ‚ààM, i.e., Œ≥p(s0) = p for some s0 ‚ààJ and
ÀôŒ≥p(s) = XŒ≥p(s) for all s ‚ààJ. Suppose DX is a derivation along X such that
the matrix of its components ŒìX (in some and hence in any frame) satisÔ¨Åes the
condition (13.6) with Œ≥ = Œ≥p for every p ‚ààM. Then, for every integral path Œ≥
of X, it is deÔ¨Åned a unique derivation DŒ≥ along Œ≥, explicitly given via (13.7).
(Note, DŒ≥ is deÔ¨Åned only along integral paths Œ≥ of X!) Repeating the proof of
Proposition 13.1 with Œ≥ being an integral path of X, we see that (13.1)‚Äì(13.3)
deÔ¨Åne a unique linear transport L along the integral paths of X in (T (M), œÄ, M).
In a local frame, the matrix of L satisÔ¨Åes the initial-value problem (13.4) and its
explicit form is (13.5).
Thus the conclusion is: to every derivation along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X (which
is C1 and non-singular) of the tensor algebra over a manifold M, there corresponds
a unique linear transport along the integral paths of X in the tangent bundle over
M (provided (13.6) holds with an integral path of X for Œ≥). Therefore, we have
the following modiÔ¨Åcation of (13.10):
derivation along Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld X
‚Üívector-derivation along the integral paths of X
‚Üílinear transport along the integral paths of X.
(13.11)
In this scheme, we intentionally dropped the condition (13.6). The reason is that
it works independently of (13.6): if (13.6) is not valid, the resulting derivation and
linear transport along the integral paths of X could depend also on the vector
Ô¨Åeld X in a neighborhood of the integral paths of X, not only on the values of
X on them. In other words, if (13.6) does not hold, the corresponding derivation
and linear transport along a particular integral path may depend not only on it
but also on a congruence of the integral paths of X in a neighborhood of the one
along which the derivation and transport act. This situation is not an exceptional
one, on the opposite, it is often met in concrete applications, Ô¨Årst of all in the
theoretical physics.2 Below we shall present a list of important examples of this
kind.
1For a Ô¨Åxed X, the equality XŒ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥(s) cannot hold for arbitrary Œ≥ as it deÔ¨Ånes the integral
paths of X ‚Äì see (I.2.19).
2In the physically-oriented literature, the situation is ‚Äòinverse‚Äô with respect to X: there is
given a congruence of (injective, C1, and regular) paths and X is deÔ¨Åned as the vector Ô¨Åeld
tangent to the paths of that congruence.

Recall (see DeÔ¨Ånition III.2.3), for every vector Ô¨Åeld X and derivation D along
vector Ô¨Åelds, the decomposition DX = LX +SX, with D: X ‚ÜíDX and LX being
the Lie derivative along X, holds for some tensor Ô¨Åeld SX of type (1, 1). Since for
a linear connection ‚àáthis equality holds for
SX = Œ£X,
Œ£X(Y ) := ‚àáXY ‚àí[X, Y ] = ‚àáY X +T (X, Y ),
Y ‚ààX(M), (13.12)
with T being the torsion of ‚àá, for every derivation D along vector Ô¨Åelds is fulÔ¨Ålled
DX = ‚àáX + SX ‚àíŒ£X
(13.13)
for (arbitrarily chosen) linear connection ‚àáand some SX ‚ààT1
1(M). Applying the
last decomposition and the explicit local expression (III.2.2), one can prove the
following statements.
Example 13.2. Let M be a manifold endowed with a linear connection ‚àá. To ‚àá
corresponds a decomposition (13.13) with
SX = Œ£X
(13.14a)
where X can be Ô¨Åxed, as well as arbitrary, and the condition (13.6) is valid.
Example 13.3. Let M be Einstein-Cartan manifold, i.e., one endowed with (gener-
ally said independent) Riemannian metric g and linear connection ‚àá. The Fermi‚Äì
Walker derivative [62,119] is a one for which (13.13) holds with
SX = Œ£X ‚àí2QX.
(13.14b)
Here X is Ô¨Åxed, (time-like,) C1, and unit vector Ô¨Åeld3 and QX ‚ààT1
1(M) with
gim(QX)m
j :=

hk
i hl
j(g( ¬∑ , ‚àáEkX))l + hm
i gmlT l
jkXk + (g( ¬∑ , ‚àáEjX))i

[ij]
where hk
i := Œ¥k
i ‚àíXk(g( ¬∑ , X))i/g(X, X) and T i
jk are the components of the torsion
tensor of ‚àá.
Example 13.4. On a Riemannian manifold, the Fermi derivative assigned to its
metric g [62] corresponds to the choice
SX = Œ£{}
X ‚àí2QX
(13.14c)
where X is a Ô¨Åxed, (time-like,) C1 and unit vector Ô¨Åeld, the index {} means that
the connection is with respect to the ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols (I.4.14) formed from g,
QX ‚ààT1
1(M), and (QX)i
j := Xi(g( ¬∑ , ‚àá{}
X X))j.
3The choice g(X, X) = +1 or g(X, X) = ‚àí1 depends on the accepted signature of g: the
former (resp. latter) one corresponds to a positive (resp. negative) ‚Äòtime‚Äô eigenvalue of g in a
diagonal form.

Example 13.5. On a Riemannian manifold, the Truesdell derivative assigned to its
metric g [120,121] is obtained from (13.13) for4
SX = Œ∏ ¬∑ Œ¥.
(13.14d)
Here X is a Ô¨Åxed, C1 and null or unit vector Ô¨Åeld (which could be time-like or
space-like), Œ∏ := 
i(‚àáEiX)i is the expansion of X, and Œ¥ is the unit tensor with
local components Œ¥j
i (in any frame).
Example 13.6. On a Riemannian manifold, the Jaumann derivative assigned to its
metric g [122] is described via (13.13) with
SX = Œ£{}
X ‚àíœâ.
(13.14e)
Here X is a Ô¨Åxed C1 and null or unit vector Ô¨Åeld (which could be time-like or

j :=

[ij].
The above list of particular derivations (along, possibly, Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åelds)
obtained via (13.13) can easily be completed by the Lie derivative [19, 89, 119],
modiÔ¨Åed Fermi-Walker and Frenet-Serret derivatives [98], etc.
Excluding the case of linear connections, all of the above-mentioned deriva-
tives are along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld and, generally, the condition (13.6) is not sat-
isÔ¨Åed for them. Consequently, the derivations and linear transports along the in-
tegral paths of X corresponding to them depend, generally, on a congruence of
integral paths, not only on the particular integral path along which they act. Re-
gardless of this, these derivations and the corresponding transports Ô¨Ånd a number
of important applications.
Exercise 13.1. Following the implications in (13.10) (or in (13.11)), prove that
from (13.13) and (13.14a)‚Äì(13.14e) can be obtained respectively: the parallel trans-
port assigned to a linear connection (covariant derivative) of the tensor algebra of
a manifold [11,19], Fermi-Walker transport [62,119], Fermi transport [62], Trues-
dell transport [120,121], and Jaumann transport [122]. This list of transports can
be completed with the Lie transport [19,119], modiÔ¨Åed Fermi-Walker and Frenet-
Serret transports [98], etc.
13.4.
Normal frames
In Subsections 13.1‚Äì13.3, it was demonstrated how to diÔ¨Äerent derivations of the
tensor algebra over a manifold can be assigned linear transports along paths in
4The choice of ‚àáis insigniÔ¨Åcant as ‚àáX ‚àíŒ£X = LX.
5The sign before the second term in the right-hand side of the next equality must be opposite
to the one of the eigenvalue of the ‚Äòtime‚Äô term of g in a diagonal form.

13. Linear transports in tangent bundles
299
the tangent bundle over it. Hence to every such derivation can be assigned two
kinds of normal frames: the ones corresponding to it as a derivation and the ones
corresponding to the linear transports generated by the derivations. These frames
were introduced and investigated respectively in Chapter III and in the present
one. Since a simple observation reveals that the derivations‚Äô components coincide
with the coeÔ¨Écients of the linear transports generated by the derivations, one
can expect the existence of some links between both sorts of normal frames. More
precisely, relying on the considerations in Section 12, we can assert that the frames,
normal for derivations along paths or (arbitrary) vector Ô¨Åelds, are strong normal
for the linear transports generated by these derivations. What concerns the frames
normal for derivations along a Ô¨Åxed vector Ô¨Åeld, it is easy to be proved that they
are also normal for the linear transports (along the integral paths of the vector
Ô¨Åeld) generated by this kind of derivations and vice versa. The opposite link is
partially valid in a sense that if a linear transport generated by a derivation admits
normal frames, then some (or all) of them, viz. the strong normal ones, are normal
for the corresponding derivation generating the initial transport.
In this way, we have came to the following important
Conclusion 13.1. All of the results, concerning normal frames and obtained in
Chapter III for diÔ¨Äerent derivations of the tensor algebra over a manifold, are
mutatis mutandis valid for the frames (strong) normal for the (corresponding)
linear transports along paths in the tangent bundle over the same manifold.
The afore-presented conclusions can also be conÔ¨Årmed by the next consid-
erations some of which are valid for general vector bundles with a manifold as a
base, not only for the tangent bundle over a manifold.
From Proposition 6.1 and Theorem 6.2, we know that only linear trans-
ports/derivations along paths with (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients given by (6.1) admit nor-
mal frames. Besides, from equations (6.1) and (6.4), it follows that frames normal
on a subset U ‚äÜM for such transports/derivations along paths exist if and only
if the matrix diÔ¨Äerential equation (5.1), or, equivalently,

ÀôŒ≥¬µ(Œì¬µA + E¬µ(A))
		
U = 0,
(13.15)
has a solution for every Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU with respect to A.6 In fact, the equations (6.16)
are the integrability conditions for (13.15).7 Evidently, the same is the situation
with derivations along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds (see Section 8) when, due to (8.6),
such a derivation admits frames normal on U iÔ¨Äthe equation

ŒìXA + X(A)
		
U = 0,
(13.16)
6If such A exist in a frame {ei}, then the frame {e‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iej} is normal on U and vice versa;
see (6.4).
7If (6.6) hold and U is a neighborhood, then A = Y (p, p0; ‚àíŒì1, . . . , ‚àíŒìdim M)A0, A0 being
non-degenerate matrix.

300
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
ŒìX being the derivation‚Äôs matrix along a vector Ô¨Åeld X, has a solution with respect
to A. As we proved in Section 8, if X is arbitrary and tangent to the paths in U,
this equation is equivalent to (13.15) with Œì¬µ being the matrices of the 3-index
coeÔ¨Écients of the derivation; if X is completely arbitrary, (13.16) is equivalent to
equation (13.17) below.
Now it is time to recall that, from mathematical view-point, the material
of Chapter III is actually devoted precisely to the solution of the normal frame
equation

Œì¬µA + E¬µ(A)
		
U = 0
(13.17)
which is equivalent to (13.15) if U is a neighborhood. The fact that in Chapter III
are studied frames normal for derivations of the tensor algebra over a manifold
M is inessential because the equations describing the matrices by means of which
is performed the transformation from an arbitrary frame to a (strong) normal
one are the same in this chapter and in Chapter III. The only diÔ¨Äerence is what
objects are transformed by means of the matrices satisfying (13.16): in the present
chapter these are the frames in the restricted bundle space œÄ‚àí1(U) ‚äÜE, while
in Chapter III they are the tensor bases over U, in particular the ones in the
bundle tangent to M. In Chapter III, the only explicit use of the derivations of
the tensor algebra over M was to deÔ¨Åne their components (2-index coeÔ¨Écients) and
the transformation law for the latter. Since this law (see (III.2.11) and (III.10.9))
is identical with (8.6),8 all results concerning the 2- and 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of
derivations of the tensor algebra over M and the ones of derivations along tangent
vectors in vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) coincide.
Thus, we have came to the following very important conclusion.
Conclusion 13.2. All of the results of Chapter III, concerning derivations along
vector Ô¨Åelds, their components, and frames normal for them, are mutatis mu-
tandis valid (as investigated in the present chapter) for linear transports along
paths, derivations along paths or along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds, their coeÔ¨Écients (or
components), and the frames (strong) normal for them in vector bundles with a
diÔ¨Äerentiable manifold as a base.
The only change, if required, to transfer the results is to replace the term
‚Äòderivation along vector Ô¨Åelds‚Äô with ‚Äòderivation along tangent vector Ô¨Åelds‚Äô, or
‚Äòderivation along paths‚Äô, or ‚Äòlinear transport along paths‚Äô and, possibly, the term
‚Äònormal frame‚Äô with ‚Äòstrong normal frame‚Äô.
Because of the widespread usage of covariant derivatives (linear connections),
we want to mention them separately regardless of the fact that this case was com-
pletely covered in Chapters II and III. As a consequence of (3.29), the covariant
derivatives are derivations linear on the whole base M (as well as on any its
subset). Thus for them the condition (6.1) is identically satisÔ¨Åed. Therefore, by
8The transformation laws (3.26) and (6.4) can be considered, under certain conditions, as
special cases of (8.6).

14. Connections and parallel transports
301
Theorem 6.2, a covariant derivative (or the corresponding parallel transport) ad-
mits normal frames on a submanifold U ‚äÜM iÔ¨Ä(6.16) holds on U. Consequently,
every covariant derivative admits normal frames at every point or along given
(smooth locally injective) path. However, only the Ô¨Çat covariant derivatives on U
admit frames normal on U if U is a neighborhood (dim U = dim M).
In the theoretical physics, we Ô¨Ånd applications of a number of linear trans-
ports along paths: parallel [11, 19], Fermi-Walker [62, 119], Fermi [62], Trues-
dell [120, 121], Jaumann [122], Lie [19, 119], modiÔ¨Åed Fermi-Walker and Frenet-
Serret [98], etc. Our results are fully applicable to all of them, in particular for all
of them there exist frames normal at a given point or/and along (smooth locally
injective) paths.
14.
Links with the theory of
connections and parallel transports
The goal of this section is twofold: on one hand, we would like to clarify the rela-
tions between the linear transports along paths and parallel transports in general
vector bundles and, on another hand, to transfer the results obtained for connec-
tions and parallel transports in vector bundles, thus generalizing the material from
Sections 11‚Äì13 concerning mainly the tangent bundle over a manifold. A part of
these problems will be generalized further in Chapter V from the view-point of
general connection theory on diÔ¨Äerentiable bundles.
The book [23] will be used consistently for reference purposes below. This is
due to the fact that in it is elaborated an axiomatical approach to the concept
of a parallel transport in vector bundles (whose bundle and base spaces are C‚àû
manifolds) and on this base the connection theory is studied. Such an exposition
perfectly matches our aims, as pointed at the beginning of Section 3.
In the present section (E, œÄ, M) will denote a vector bundle whose bundle
and base spaces, E and M, are C‚àûmanifolds, N stands for a C‚àûmanifold, and
g: N ‚ÜíM is supposed to be of class C‚àû. In general, for the consistency with [23],
all manifolds and mappings between them are supposed to be of class C‚àûin this
section.1
14.1.
Parallelism structures, connections and
covariant derivatives
In this subsection the (axiomatical) deÔ¨Ånition of a parallel transport and its links
with the concepts of connection and covariant derivative from [23] are reproduced
1Such a supposition is too strong. For the most of the material that follows, smoothness of class
C2 (and sometimes C1) is suÔ¨Écient. (Smoothness of class C3 is required if normal coordinates,
if any, are concerned.)

302
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
and brieÔ¨Çy reviewed. We have chosen the pointed deÔ¨Ånition from [23] for two rea-
sons: (i) in the sense of [23, Theorems 2.28 and 2.33] it provides an equivalent de-
scription of the notion of a connection on vector bundles, and (ii) in the available to
the author literature, the book [23] provides the most advanced and well-developed
axiomatical approach to the notion of a parallel transport (in vector bundles).
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.1 (cf. [23, DeÔ¨Ånition 2.7]). Let (E, œÄ, M), E and M being C‚àûman-
ifolds, be a vector bundle and Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM, a, b ‚ààR with a ‚â§b, be a C‚àûpath
in M. A mapping P associating to each pair (u, Œ≤), u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)), a (unique) C‚àû
lifting of Œ≤ from M to E is called a parallelism structure (or a system of parallel
transport) in (E, œÄ, M) if the following Ô¨Åve conditions are satisÔ¨Åed:
(i) Existence. The value PŒ≤
u of P at (u, Œ≤), P: (u, Œ≤) ‚ÜíPŒ≤
u, is such that
PŒ≤
u(a) = u
(14.1)
(and, by deÔ¨Ånition, Pu : Œ≤ ‚ÜíPŒ≤
u : [a, b] ‚ÜíE with œÄ ‚ó¶PŒ≤
u = Œ≤), i.e., PŒ≤
u is a
lifting of Œ≤ through u starting exactly from the point u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)).
(ii) Linearity and invertability. The mapping
PŒ≤ : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(b))
(14.2)
deÔ¨Åned by
PŒ≤(u) := PŒ≤
u(b)
(14.3)
for every u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)) is a vector space isomorphism. It is called parallel
transport along Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM (assigned to P). The parallel transport along
the inverse path Œ≤‚àí: [a, b] ‚ÜíM, Œ≤‚àí: s ‚ÜíŒ≤‚àí(s) := Œ≤(a + b ‚àís) for each
s ‚àà[a, b], is
PŒ≤‚àí=

PŒ≤‚àí1.
(14.4)
(iii) Parameterization independence. Let œï: [c, d] ‚Üí[a, b] be C‚àûfunction such
that œï(c) = a and œï(d) = b. Then
PŒ≤‚ó¶œï
u
= PŒ≤
u ‚ó¶œï.
(14.5)
(iv) C‚àûdependence on initial conditions. For every open set U ‚äÜM and each
C‚àûmapping f : T (U) ‚ÜíM such that f(0p) = p, p ‚ààU, with 0p being the
zero vector in Tp(U) = Tp(M), the mapping
Àúf : T (U) √ó œÄ‚àí1(U) ‚ÜíE,
Àúf : (X, u) ‚ÜíPŒ±
u(1),
Œ±(s) := f(sX)
(14.6)
where (X, u) ‚ààT (U) √ó œÄ‚àí1(U) and s ‚àà[0, 1], is of class C‚àû.
(v) Initial uniqueness. If p ‚ààM and the C‚àûpaths Œ±, Œ≤ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM are such
that Œ±(0) = Œ≤(0) = p and2 ÀôŒ±(0) = ÀôŒ≤(0), then for each u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(p) the tangent
vectors to the paths PŒ±
u, PŒ≤
u : [0, 1] ‚ÜíE at the point s = 0 coincide:
Àô.
PŒ±u(0) =
Àô.
PŒ≤
u(0).
(14.7)
2The tangent vectors ÀôŒ±(0) and ÀôŒ≤(0) are considered as deÔ¨Åned by one-sided derivative operators
‚Äì see (I.2.3).

14. Connections and parallel transports
303
The parallelism structures are an equivalent way for describing general con-
nections on vector bundles. To formulate this statement in a rigorous way (see
Theorem 14.1 below), we have to present some preliminary material.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.2. A lifting (or lift) ¬ØŒ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíE of a C‚àûpath Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM,
œÄ ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≤ = Œ≤, is said to be parallel with respect to a parallelism structure P in a vector
bundle (E, œÄ, M) if ¬ØŒ≤ = PŒ≤
¬ØŒ≤(a); respectively, the paths PŒ≤
u, with u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a))
and Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM, in E are called parallel (with respect to P). A section œÉ ‚àà
Sec(E, œÄ, M) is parallel along Œ≤ (with respect to P) if the lifting ÀÜŒ≤ = œÉ ‚ó¶Œ≤ is
parallel (with respect to P).
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.3 (cf. [23, DeÔ¨Ånition 2.26]). A connection on vector bundle (E, œÄ, M)
is a (dim M)-dimensional distribution T h(E): E ‚ÜíT (E) such that:
(i) For each u ‚ààE the value T h
u (E) of T h(E) at u, T h(E): u ‚ÜíT h
u (E), is in the
tangent space Tu(E) and is (direct) complement to its vertical component
T v
u(E) := Tu

œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(u))

, i.e., to the space tangent to the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(u))
through u:
Tu(E) =: T h
u (E) ‚äïT v
u(E).
(14.8)
(ii) The spaces T h
u (E) are homogeneous in a sense that
¬µc‚àó

T h
u (E)

= T h
¬µc(u)(E) = T h
cu(E),
c ‚ààK
(14.9)
where ¬µc : E ‚ÜíE with ¬µc : u ‚Üícu and ¬µc‚àó:= (¬µc)‚àóis the diÔ¨Äerential of ¬µc.
Let us set T v(E) := ‚à™u‚ààET v
u(E). By abuse of the notation, we put T h(E) to
denote also the union ‚à™u‚ààET h
u (E). Thus, we have the direct decomposition
T (E) = T h(E) ‚äïT v(E).
(14.10)
Remark 14.1. A connection on the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄT , M) over M is called
(linear) connection on M. For some details, see below Proposition 14.5 and Re-
mark 14.3.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.4. The spaces T h
u (E) and T v
u(E) are called horizontal and vertical,
respectively, space (tangent to E at u); the vectors of these spaces are called
respectively horizontal and vertical vectors.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.5 (cf. [23, DeÔ¨Ånition 2.27]). Let T h(E) be a connection on (E, œÄ, M).
A lifting
¬Øf : N ‚ÜíE of a C‚àûmapping f : N ‚ÜíM, N being a manifold, is
horizontal with respect to T h(E) (or is T h(E)-horizontal) if ¬Øf‚àó(Tp(N))) ‚äÜT h
¬Øf(p)(E)
for every p ‚ààN, i.e., the induced tangent mapping ¬Øf‚àóof ¬Øf sends the vectors tangent
to N at p to horizontal vectors (tangent) at ¬Øf(p). In particular, a path ¬ØŒ≤ in E,
which is a lifting of the path œÄ ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≤ in M, is horizontal if its tangent vector Ô¨Åeld is
a path in T h(E).

304
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.6. If T h(E) is a connection on (E, œÄ, M), the (T h(E)-)horizontal
lifting of a vector Ô¨Åeld X ‚ààX(M) = Sec(T (M), œÄT , M) is the unique vector Ô¨Åeld
¬ØX ‚ààX(E) = Sec(E, œÄ, M) such that ¬ØXu ‚ààT h
u (E) and ¬ØX and X are œÄ-related, i.e.,
œÄ‚àó‚ó¶¬ØX = X ‚ó¶œÄ.
Proposition 14.1. Let T h(E) be a connection on some vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) and
Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM be a C‚àûpath in M. For every t0 ‚àà[a, b] and u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(t0)), there
exists a unique T h(E)-horizontal lifting ¬ØŒ≤ of Œ≤ to E such that ¬ØŒ≤(t0) = u.
Proof. See [23, Proposition 2.32 on p. 59].
‚ñ°
Theorem 14.1 (cf. [23, Theorems 2.28 and 2.33]). Each given parallelism structure
P in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) determines a connection T h(E) on (E, œÄ, M) such
that a path ¬ØŒ≤ in E is a parallel lifting of the path Œ≤ = œÄ ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≤ in M with respect to P
if and only if ¬ØŒ≤ is horizontal with respect to T h(E), i.e., iÔ¨ÄÀô¬ØŒ≤ is a path in T h(E).
Conversely, if T h(E) is a connection on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M), the system of
T h(E)-horizontal liftings to E of the C‚àûpaths in M is a parallelism structure in
(E, œÄ, M) and, besides, the connection on (E, œÄ, M) determined by it according to
the previous assertion is just T h(E).
Proof. See [23, pp. 55‚Äì61].
‚ñ°
The last theorem is a rigorous expression of the assertion that a parallelism
structure in a vector bundle is equivalent to a connection on the same bundle.
By its means one can easily prove some important properties of the parallelism
structures.
Proposition 14.2. Let P be a parallelism structure in vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) and
Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM be a C‚àûpath. For each c ‚àà[a, b] and u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)),
PŒ≤
u(Œª) = PŒ≤|[a,c]
u
(Œª),
Œª ‚àà[a, c].
(14.11)
Proof. Let T h(E) be the connection on (E, œÄ, M) determined by P as in Theo-
rem 14.1. Since PŒ≤
u and PŒ≤|[a,c]
u
are parallel liftings of respectively Œ≤ and Œ≤|[a,c]
through u, they are the unique T h(E)-horizontal liftings of respectively Œ≤ and
Œ≤|[a,c] through u. Consider the restricted lifting PŒ≤
u
		
[a,c]. As œÄ ‚ó¶

PŒ≤

[a,c]

= Œ≤|[a,c]
and PŒ≤
u
		
[a,c](a) = PŒ≤
u(a) = u, it is a T h(E)-horizontal lifting through u and, due to
the uniqueness of such liftings (see Proposition 14.1), we have
PŒ≤
u
		
[a,c] = PŒ≤|[a,c]
u
( 14.11‚Ä≤)
which is equivalent to (14.11).
‚ñ°
Proposition 14.3. Let P be a parallelism structure in (E, œÄ, M), the path Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚Üí
M be C‚àû, and u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)). For each c ‚àà[a, b],

Now we shall consider brieÔ¨Çy the description of parallelism structures (and
hence connections) on vector bundles in terms of covariant derivatives.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.7. Let (E, œÄ, M), E and M being C‚àûmanifolds, be a K-vector
bundle and g: N ‚ÜíM, N being C‚àûmanifold, be of class C‚àû. A mapping
‚àá: X(N) √ó Liftg(E, œÄ, M) ‚ÜíLiftg(E, œÄ, M) is called a covariant derivative (or
covariant derivative operator) in (E, œÄ, M) along g if for every U, V ‚ààX(N) and
X, Y ‚ààLiftg(E, œÄ, M) the mapping ‚àá: (U, X) ‚Üí‚àáUX has the properties:
(i) ‚àáU+V X = ‚àáUX + ‚àáV X;
(ii) ‚àáfUX = f‚àáUX,
f ‚ààF(N);
(iii) ‚àáU(X + Y ) = ‚àáUX + ‚àáUY ;
(iv) ‚àáU(hX) = U(h)X + h‚àáUX,
h ‚ààF1(N).
The mapping ‚àáX : X(N) ‚ÜíLiftg(E, œÄ, M), associated to a covariant derivative
‚àáand such that ‚àáX : U ‚Üí(‚àáX)(U) := ‚àáUX, is called covariant diÔ¨Äerential of
X (along g) and the lifting ‚àáUX of g is called covariant derivative (along g) of
X with respect (or along) U. If u ‚ààTp(N), p ‚ààN, we set ‚àáuX := (‚àáUX)p with
U ‚ààX(N) such that Up = u, which is well-deÔ¨Åned due to (i) and (ii).
Two important special cases are worth singling out. If N = M and g = idM,
then ‚àáis called covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M). Besides, if in addition E =
T (M), i.e., if ‚àáis a covariant derivative in the tangent bundle over M, then ‚àáis
called covariant derivative on M.
To formulate the second main result of this subsection, Theorem 14.2 below,
we shall brieÔ¨Çy present some preliminary material.3
Put œÄ‚àóE := œÄ‚àó(E) := {(Œ∂, Œæ)|Œ∂, Œæ ‚ààE, œÄ(Œ∂) = œÄ(Œæ)}.4 Evidently, œÄ‚àóE is a
vector space. We assert that œÄ‚àóE is isomorphic to the vertical component T v(E) :=
‚à™u‚ààET v
u(E) = ‚à™u‚ààETu

œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(u))

of the bundle space T (E). To prove this, deÔ¨Åne

this point to Theorem 14.2.
4The set œÄ‚àó(E) is the bundle space of the pullback of (E, œÄ, M) along œÄ [23, p. 8].

g: œÄ‚àóE ‚ÜíT v(E) by g: (Œ∂, Œæ) ‚ÜígŒ∂Œæ := ÀôŒ±(0) where (Œ∂, Œæ) ‚ààœÄ‚àóand Œ± is a path in E
given via Œ±: t ‚ÜíŒ±(t) := Œ∂+tŒæ, t ‚ààR. The mapping g is a vector space isomorphism
and its inverse is g‚àí1 : w ‚Üí(Œ∂, Œæ), w ‚ààT v(E) ‚äÇT (E), where Œ∂ := œÄT (E)(w) ‚ààE,
œÄT (E) being the projection of the tangent bundle (T (E), œÄT (E), E) over E, and Œæ is
a point in œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(Œ∂)), considered as a manifold, such that its coordinates in some
Ô¨Åxed local coordinates {xi} are equal to the local coordinates of w (as an element
of T v

Denote by pr2 : T v(E) ‚ÜíE a mapping assigning to each w ‚ààT v(E) the ‚Äúsec-
ond component‚Äù of the element of œÄ‚àó(E) corresponding to w via g, i.e., pr2(w) := Œæ
if w = gŒ∂Œæ for some (unique) (Œ∂, Œæ) ‚ààœÄ‚àó(E).
If T h(E) is a connection on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M), every vector w ‚ààT (E)
has, according to (14.8), a unique decomposition w = wh+wv, where, if w ‚ààTu(E)
for some u ‚ààE, wh ‚ààT h
u (E) and wv ‚ààT v
u(E) are, respectively, the horizontal
and vertical components of w. The connection mapping Œ∫ : T (E) ‚ÜíE of T h(E)
is deÔ¨Åned by Œ∫ : w ‚ÜíŒ∫(w) := pr2(wv) = pr2(w ‚àíwh) for each w ‚ààT (E).
Theorem 14.2. Let T h(E) be a connection on some vector bundle (E, œÄ, M), the
mapping Œ∫ : T (E) ‚ÜíE be its connection mapping, and g: N ‚ÜíM, where N
is C‚àûmanifold, be of class C‚àû. The mapping ‚àá: X(N) √ó Liftg(E, œÄ, M) ‚Üí
Liftg(E, œÄ, M) given by ‚àá: (U, X) ‚Üí‚àáUX := Œ∫(X‚àó(U)) for every (U, X) ‚àà
X(N) √ó Liftg(E, œÄ, M) is a covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M) along g. Besides,
a lifting X ‚ààLiftg(E, œÄ, M) is parallel (with respect to the parallelism structure
assigned to T h(E) via 14.1) if and only if ‚àáUX = 0 for all U ‚ààX(N) and if
h: L ‚ÜíN for a C‚àûmanifold L, then ‚àá(X ‚ó¶h) = (‚àáX)‚ó¶h‚àówhere the Ô¨Årst (resp.
second ) ‚àáis along g ‚ó¶h (resp. g). Conversely, if ‚àáis a covariant derivative in
(E, œÄ, M) (along idM), then there exists a connection T h(E) on (E, œÄ, M) such
that X‚àó(v) ‚ààT h(E) for given X ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) and v ‚ààT (M) if and only if
‚àávX = 0.
Proof. See [23, pp. 74‚Äì77].
‚ñ°
Corollary 14.1 (cf. [23, Corollary 2.59]). A covariant derivative ‚àáin a vector
bundle (E, œÄ, M) determines a parallelism structure P in it such that a lifting
X ‚ààLiftŒ≤(E, œÄ, M) of a C‚àûlocally injective path Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM is parallel (along
Œ≤ with respect to P) iÔ¨Ä
‚àáÀôŒ≤X = 0.
(14.13)
Remark 14.2. Regardless of the appearance of equation (14.13) in the book [23,
Corollary 2.59], its left-hand side is not well deÔ¨Åned without special explanations
which are not given in [23], where implicitly is assumed Œ≤ to be injective, as in our
text until now. The problem is that the mapping ‚àáV , V ‚ààX(M), in particular
‚àáv with v ‚ààT (M) or ‚àáÀôŒ≤(s), s ‚àà[a, b], acts on sections of (E, œÄ, M), which are
liftings of g = idM to E, not on liftings of paths or on a lifting of a particular path
such as X ‚ààLiftŒ≤(E, œÄ, M). Besides, the symbol ‚àáÀôŒ≤ is not deÔ¨Åned as ÀôŒ≤ is a lifting
of Œ≤ to T (M) and, if Œ≤ has self-intersections, it cannot be considered as a vector

14. Connections and parallel transports
307
Ô¨Åeld on Œ≤([a, b]). For these reasons, the symbol ‚àáÀôŒ≤X is incorrect. For injective
path Œ≤, the symbol ‚àáÀôŒ≤X may be deÔ¨Åned as a section of (E, œÄ, M)|Œ≤([a,b]) such
that ‚àáÀôŒ≤X : Œ≤(s) ‚Üí‚àáÀôŒ≤(s)X := (‚àáV ÀáX)Œ≤(s), s ‚àà[a, b], where V ‚ààX(M) satisÔ¨Åes
VŒ≤(s) := ÀôŒ≤(s) and ÀáX ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) is such that ÀáX : Œ≤(s) ‚ÜíÀáXŒ≤(s) := X(s). If Œ≤ is
not injective, i.e., if it has self-intersections, then ‚àáÀôŒ≤X, with X ‚ààLiftŒ≤(E, œÄ, M),
should be regarded as a lifting of Œ≤ to E, ‚àáÀôŒ≤X ‚ààLiftŒ≤(E, œÄ, M), such that
(‚àáÀôŒ≤X): s ‚Üí(‚àáÀôŒ≤X)(s) :=
dXi(s)
ds
+ Œìi
j¬µ(Œ≤(s))Xj(s) ÀôŒ≤¬µ(s)

ei(Œ≤(s))
(14.14)
where the notation is explained in the paragraphs containing equations (14.18)‚Äì
(14.21) below. In a case of injective path Œ≤ both deÔ¨Ånitions agree in a sense that
‚àáÀôŒ≤(s) ÀáX = (‚àáÀôŒ≤X)(s), i.e., the value of ‚àáÀôŒ≤X, as a section over Œ≤([a, b]), at Œ≤(s) is
equal to the value of ‚àáÀôŒ≤X, as a lifting of Œ≤, at s ‚àà[a, b].
Proof. The operator ‚àá, by the second part of Theorem 14.2, determines a connec-
tion T h(E) in (E, œÄ, M) which in turn, by Theorem 14.1, determines a parallelism
structure P in (E, œÄ, M) (via the T h(E)-horizontal liftings of the C‚àûpaths in
M). Since a path in E is parallel with respect to P iÔ¨Äit is T h(E)-horizontal, X is
parallel iÔ¨ÄÀôXX(s) ‚ààT h
X(s)(E) for each s ‚àà[a, b]. Denoting by D :=
d
dt ‚ààX(R) the
tangent vector Ô¨Åeld to R, we can write [7, Section 1.23 (e)] ÀôXX(s) = X‚àó|s(D|s).
So, X is parallel iÔ¨Ä
ÀôXX(s) = X‚àó|s(D|s) ‚ààT h
X(s)(E).
(14.15)
Suppose Œ≤ is injective and denote by Œ≤‚àí1 : Œ≤([a, b]) ‚Üí[a, b] the mapping in-
verse to Œ≤ on the image Œ≤([a, b]). Since ÀôŒ≤(s) = Œ≤‚àó|Œ≤(s)(D|s), we have5 D|s =

Œ≤‚àó|Œ≤(s)
‚àí1( ÀôŒ≤(s)) =

(Œ≤‚àí1)‚àó|Œ≤(s)

( ÀôŒ≤(s)). Substituting this in ÀôXX(s) = X‚àó|s(D|s),
we get
ÀôXX(s) = [(X ‚ó¶Œ≤‚àí1)‚àó|Œ≤(s)]( ÀôŒ≤(s))
(14.16)
for every injective path Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM and s ‚àà[a, b]. Let ÀáX ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) be
such that ÀáX|Œ≤([a,b]) := X ‚ó¶Œ≤‚àí1.6 Now the condition (14.15) is tantamount to
ÀáX‚àó|Œ≤(s)( ÀôŒ≤(s)) ‚ààT h
X(s)(E) which, by the last assertion of Theorem 14.2, is equiva-
lent to
‚àáÀôŒ≤(s) ÀáX := (‚àáV ÀáX)|Œ≤(s) = 0
(14.17)
where V ‚ààX(M) and V |Œ≤(s) := ÀôŒ≤(s). At the end, if we identify ÀáX along Œ≤ with
X, as ÀáX : Œ≤(s) ‚Üí(X ‚ó¶Œ≤‚àí1)(Œ≤(s)) ‚â°X(s), the last equality can be rewritten
as (14.13).
Let now Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM be locally injective and, for each s ‚àà[a, b], the symbol
Js denotes the maximal subinterval Js ‚äÜ[a, b] containing s, Js ‚àãs, such that
5Here and below we apply the formula (œï ‚ó¶œà)‚àó|p = œï‚àó|œà(p) ‚ó¶œà‚àó|p, where œà: L ‚ÜíM,
œï: M ‚ÜíN, L, M, and N are C1 manifolds and p ‚ààL; see [7, Section 1.25 (c)].
6The existence of a C‚àûsection
Àá
X with the property mentioned can be easily proved by
applying [15, Lemma 5 on p. 28] to the components of Àá
X in some frame over Œ≤([a, b]).

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Œ≤s := Œ≤|Js is injective. Repeating the above procedure, we see that Xs := X|Js
is parallel along Œ≤s iÔ¨Ä‚àáÀôŒ≤s(t) ÀáXs = 0, t ‚ààJs, with ÀáXs ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) such that
ÀáXs|Œ≤s(Js) = ÀáXs|Œ≤(Js) := X ‚ó¶Œ≤‚àí1
s . From the derived further local expression (14.20)
follows that ‚àáÀôŒ≤s1(t) ÀáXs1 = ‚àáÀôŒ≤s2(t) ÀáXs2 for s1, s2 ‚àà[a, b], Js1 ‚à©Js2 Ã∏= ‚àÖ, and t ‚àà
Js1 ‚à©Js2 and, moreover, ‚àáÀôŒ≤s(t) ÀáXs = ÀÜX(t), where the lifting ÀÜX ‚ààLiftŒ≤(E, œÄ, M) is
locally given by the right-hand side of (14.14). At the end, if, as above, we identify
ÀáXs with X|Js, we can set ‚àáÀôŒ≤s(t)Xs = ÀÜX|Js which is a local version of (14.14) and,
consequently, (14.13) is a global variant of ‚àáÀôŒ≤s ÀáXs = 0, s ‚àà[a, b].
‚ñ°
Theorems 14.1 and 14.2 and Corollary 14.1 imply
Conclusion 14.1. The concepts of parallelism structure, connection, and covariant
derivative respectively in, on, and in a vector bundle are equivalent: given any one
of them, the other two can appropriately be assigned to it.
By abuse of the language but without risk of ambiguity, the covariant deriva-
tives are called connections (as in DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.1 on page 21), the reason being
the last conclusion.
Before closing this long introductory subsection, we would like to write some
local expressions and decompositions which will essentially be used further.
Let ‚àág be a covariant derivative in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) along a C‚àû
mapping g: N ‚ÜíM, where E, M, and N are C‚àûmanifolds. Let U be an open
subset in N. Suppose {E¬µ|¬µ = 1, . . . , dim N} is a frame in T (N) over U and
{ei|i = 1, . . . , œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààM} is a frame, possibly depending on g, along g|U in E,
i.e., for each q ‚ààN, {E¬µ|q} is a basis in Tq(N) and {ei(q; g)} is a basis in œÄ‚àí1(g(q))
(along g). Notice, E¬µ are vector Ô¨Åelds over U in T (N), while ei( ¬∑ ; g): q ‚Üíei(q; g)
are liftings of g.
For every V ‚ààX(U) and Xg ‚ààLiftg((E, œÄ, M)|U), we write the expansions
(p ‚ààM)
V = V ¬µE¬µ ‚â°
dim N

¬µ=1
V ¬µE¬µ,
Xg = Xi
gei( ¬∑ ; g) ‚â°
dim œÄ‚àí1(p)

i=1
Xi
gei( ¬∑ ; g)
for some C‚àûfunctions V ¬µ, Xi
g : U ‚ÜíK. Applying the properties (i)‚Äì(iv) of DeÔ¨Å-
nition 14.7 and using that ‚àág
V Xg ‚ààLiftg((E, œÄ, M)|U) (here and below g is not a
summation index!), we get
‚àág
V (Xg) = V ¬µ
E¬µ(Xi
g) + Œìi
j¬µ( ¬∑ ; g)Xj
g

ei( ¬∑ ; g)
(14.18)
where the summation over ¬µ(, ŒΩ, . . .) is from 1 to dim N and over i(, j, . . .) is from
1 to dim œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààM. Here the functions Œìi
j¬µ( ¬∑ ; g): U ‚ÜíK are deÔ¨Åned by
(cf. (I.3.1))
‚àáE¬µ(ej( ¬∑ ; g)) =: Œìi

and are called local coeÔ¨Écients of the covariant derivative ‚àág with respect to the
pair of frames ({E¬µ}, {ei}).
If ‚àáis a covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M), ‚àá= ‚àáidM , then the argument
g(= idM) above will be omitted, i.e.,
‚àáV (X) = V ¬µ(E¬µ(Xi) + Œìi
j¬µXj)ei
(14.20)
where X ‚ààSec((E, œÄ, M)|U), ei are considered as vector Ô¨Åelds, and the functions
Œìi
j¬µ : U ‚ÜíK, U ‚äÜM, are given via (cf. (I.3.1))
‚àáE¬µ(ej) =: Œìi
j¬µei.
(14.21)
Proposition 14.4. Every derivation DŒ≥ in (E, œÄ, M) along a Ô¨Åxed C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚Üí
M with coeÔ¨Écients (cf. (2.9) and (6.1))
Œìi
j( ¬∑ ; Œ≥) = Œìi
j¬µ( ¬∑ ; Œ≥)ÀôŒ≥¬µ,
(14.22)
where Œìi
j¬µ( ¬∑ ; Œ≥): J ‚ÜíK, is a covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M) along Œ≥ with
respect to ÀôŒ≥.
Proof. Compare (14.18) with (2.9) or check the properties described in DeÔ¨Åni-
tion 14.7 with Œ≥ and DŒ≥ for g and ‚àá, respectively, invoking the deÔ¨Ånition of DŒ≥
(see DeÔ¨Ånition 2.1 on page 219).
‚ñ°
Proposition 14.5. A linear connection ‚àáin the tangent bundle over a manifold M
is a covariant derivative in this bundle (along the identity mapping idM).
Proof. Compare (14.18) with (I.3.2) and (I.3.3) for r = s = 1 or restrict DeÔ¨Å-
nition I.3.1 on page 21 to the tangent bundle over M and check the properties
described in DeÔ¨Ånition 14.7.
‚ñ°
Remark 14.3. If one starts with the general theory of connections on vector bun-
dles, Proposition 14.5 should be converted into a deÔ¨Ånition, i.e., in such an ap-
proach a linear connection on a manifold is deÔ¨Åned as a connection on its tangent
bundle and, by abuse of the language, the associated covariant derivative is also
called linear connection on the same manifold. For details, see [23, p. 93 Ô¨Ä].
Suppose the frames {E¬µ} and {ei} are subjected simultaneously to the fol-
lowing changes

valued functions of class C‚àû. (In what follows, it is suÔ¨Écient A( ¬∑ ; g) to be of class
C1 or C2 and B to be arbitrary of class at most C2.) A straightforward calcula-
tion, based on (14.19), reveals that the change (14.23) leads to the transformation

(14.25)
The reader may have notice that, up to notation and meaning of the sym-
bols, (14.24) and (14.25) are identical with (6.5) and (6.4), respectively. We shall
comment on this fact later in subsection 14.3.
If one is dealing with a connection in a bundle (E, œÄ, M) (along idM), the
argument g(= dM) should be deleted in equations (14.23)‚Äì(14.25) in accordance
with (14.20) and (14.21).
Now we shall derive the parallel transport equation in a given vector bundle
(E, œÄ, M) (cf. [23, p. 77, Exercise 1]).
Let ‚àábe a covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M) and P be the determined by it
parallelism structure according to Corollary 14.1. By the same corollary, a section
X ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) is parallel along Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM iÔ¨Ä‚àáÀôŒ≤X = 0. Writing this
equation in a pair of frames ({E¬µ}, {ei}), {E¬µ} in T (M) and {ei} in E, and
applying (14.20), we get

with s ‚àà[a, b], ÀôŒ≤(s) = ÀôŒ≤¬µ(s)E¬µ|Œ≤(s) ‚ààTŒ≤(s)(M), and X = Xiei.
Relying on the results obtained, we can partially generalize DeÔ¨Ånition 14.2
as follows.7
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.8. Let ‚àág be a covariant derivative in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) along
a mapping g: N ‚ÜíM. A lifting X ‚ààLiftg(E, œÄ, M) is called parallel (with respect
to ‚àág) if ‚àág
V X = 0 for every V ‚ààX(N). A lifting X of g to E is called parallel
(with respect to ‚àág) along a path Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíN in N (not in M!) if ‚àág
ÀôŒ≤X = 0.

Parallel transports in vector bundles
This subsection is devoted to some problems connected with the axiomatical def-
inition of parallel transports in vector bundles.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.9. The parallel transport P in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) correspond-
ing (assigned) to a parallelism structure P in (E, œÄ, M) is a mapping P: Œ≤ ‚ÜíPŒ≤
assigning to every C‚àûpath Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM in M the parallel transport along Œ≤
deÔ¨Åned by P via (14.2) and (14.3).
Proposition 14.6. The parallel transport is reparameterization invariant in a sense
that, if Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM and œï: [c, d] ‚Üí[a, b] is C‚àûand such that œï(c) = a and
œï(d) = b, then
PŒ≤‚ó¶œï = PŒ≤
(14.28)
Proof. See (14.3) and (14.5).
‚ñ°
DeÔ¨Åne the product (or the product path Œ±Œ≤) of two paths Œ±: [a, b] ‚ÜíM and
Œ≤ : [b, c] ‚ÜíM with Œ±(b) = Œ≤(b) by8
Œ± ¬∑ Œ≤ := Œ±Œ≤ : [a, c] ‚ÜíM,
Œ±Œ≤(s) :=

Œ±(s)
for s ‚àà[a, b]
Œ≤(s)
for s ‚àà[b, c] .
(14.29)
The product of paths is associative but not commutative.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.10. Suppose Œ±: [a, b] ‚ÜíM and Œ≤ : [b, c] ‚ÜíM are of class C‚àûand
Œ±(b) = Œ≤(b). If the product path Œ±Œ≤ is not C‚àûat the point s = b, the parallel
transport along Œ±Œ≤ is deÔ¨Åned to be composition of the parallel transports along
the constituent paths:
PŒ±Œ≤ = PŒ≤ ‚ó¶PŒ±.
(14.30)
8In [23, p. 51] the product Œ±Œ≤ is denoted by Œ≤ ‚àóŒ±; this is a matter of convention. See also the
comments in [23, Section 2.16].

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
More generally, if Œ±i : [ai, ai+1] ‚ÜíM, i = 1, . . . , k with k ‚ààN\{1}, are C‚àûpaths,
Œ±i(ai+1) = Œ±i+1(ai+1) for i = 1, . . . , k ‚àí1, and the product path Œ±1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Œ±k is not
C‚àûat the points a2, . . . , ak‚àí1, then by deÔ¨Ånition
PŒ±1¬∑¬∑¬∑Œ±k = PŒ±k ‚ó¶¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚ó¶PŒ±1.
(14.31)
Remark 14.4. In (14.30) and (14.31) we use the equality sign (=) instead of the
equal by deÔ¨Ånition one (:=) because they are valid also in the case when, respec-
tively, Œ±Œ≤ and Œ±1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Œ±k are C‚àûpaths (not only C‚àûpiecewise as assumed above)
which will be proved later; but the validity of, e.g., (14.30) for a C‚àûpath Œ±Œ≤ is a
theorem, not a deÔ¨Ånition (see Proposition 14.8).
Remark 14.5. Suppose Œ±: [a, b] ‚ÜíM is (Ô¨Ånite) C‚àûpiecewise path, i.e., there are
k ‚ààN\{1} and numbers a1, . . . , ak+1 ‚àà[a, b] such that a = a1 < a2 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ <
ak+1 = b, the paths Œ±i := Œ±|[ai,ai+1], i = 1, . . . , k are C‚àû, and Œ± is not C‚àûat the
points a2, . . . , ak‚àí1. Since
Œ≤ = (Œ≤|[b1,b2]) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (Œ≤|[bk,bk+1])
(14.32)
for every Œ≤ : [c, d] ‚ÜíM and b1, . . . , bk+1 ‚àà[c, d] such that c = b1 < b2 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ <
bk+1 = d, we have Œ± = Œ±1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Œ±k and, by (14.31),
PŒ± = PŒ±k ‚ó¶¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚ó¶PŒ±1.
(14.33)
Therefore the parallel transport along a piecewise C‚àûpath is equal to the compo-
sition (in the corresponding order) of the parallel transports along the C‚àûparts
of the initial path.
Proposition 14.7. If P is a parallel transport assigned to a parallelism structure P
in a vector bundle, Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM is C‚àû, and c ‚àà[a, b], then
PŒ≤ = PŒ≤|[c,b] ‚ó¶PŒ≤[a,c]
(14.34)
Proof. The equality (14.34) is a consequence of (14.12) with Œª = b and equa-
tion (14.3).
‚ñ°
Proposition 14.8. The equalities (14.30) and (14.31) are valid for C‚àû(and, by
deÔ¨Ånition, for piecewise C‚àû) paths Œ±Œ≤ and Œ±1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Œ±k respectively.
Proof. Apply (14.34) with Œ±Œ≤ for Œ≤ and use (14.29).
‚ñ°
Let us recall, in the approach of [23], which was followed in the previous
subsection and until now in the present one, the concept of a parallel transport is
a secondary one as it was deÔ¨Åned on the base of the one of a parallelism structure
(or, equivalently, connection or covariant derivative). Now we want to revert the
situation by showing that the parallel transport can be deÔ¨Åned in an indepen-
dent axiomatic way as a consequence of which the parallelism structures (and,

14. Connections and parallel transports
313
hence, connections and covariant derivatives) can be introduced on its ground.9
Before giving the corresponding deÔ¨Ånition, we would like to mention that there are
three groups of axioms when one tries to deÔ¨Åne a parallel transport axiomatically.
First, there are axioms of a ‚Äúfunctional type‚Äù describing the parallel transport
as a mapping on the set of paths, which we assume to be of class C‚àûfor the
consistency with [23] but, generally, this is a too strong restriction. These axioms
are well known and appear in practically identical form in diÔ¨Äerent works. Below
they are written as (14.35)‚Äì(14.38). The second group describes the ‚Äúsmoothness
properties‚Äù of the parallel transport. The concrete axioms in it vary signiÔ¨Åcantly
in the diÔ¨Äerent works depending on their particular aims. Here we choose them in
a way consistent with the properties of the parallelism structures (see (14.39) and
(14.40) below). The last group includes axioms describing the compatibility of the
parallel transport with other structures, if any, such as metric, (almost) complex
structure, etc. This group is not a subject of this investigation, so we admit it to
be empty. As an example of such a type of axiom, we point the condition (I.4.2)
on page 35 for a linear connection which means that the parallel transport does
not change the scalar products of the vectors when they are transported by its
means.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11. Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle. A parallel transport in the
bundle (E, œÄ, M) is a mapping P assigning to each path Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM a mapping
PŒ≤ : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(b))
(14.35)
such that:
(i) PŒ≤ is a vector space isomorphism;
(ii) if œï: [c, d] ‚Üí[a, b] is C‚àûand œï(c) = a and œï(d) = b, then
PŒ≤‚ó¶œï = PŒ≤;
(14.36)
(iii) if Œ≤‚àíis the path inverse to Œ≤,
PŒ≤‚àí=

PŒ≤‚àí1;
(14.37)
(iv) if Œ±: [c, a] ‚ÜíM, Œ±(a) = Œ≤(a) and Œ±Œ≤ is the product of Œ± and Œ≤,
PŒ±Œ≤ = PŒ≤ ‚ó¶PŒ±;
(14.38)
(v) under the hypotheses preceding equation (14.6) in condition (iv) of DeÔ¨Åni-
tion 14.1, the mapping
Àúf : T (U) √ó œÄ‚àí1(U) ‚ÜíE,
Àúf : (X, u) ‚ÜíPŒ±(u),
Œ±(s) := f(sX), (14.39)
where (X, u) ‚ààT (U) √ó œÄ‚àí1(U) and s ‚àà[0, 1], is of class C‚àû;
9A reader interested in the earliest essential published account on this problem should read
the paper [31].

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
(vi) if Œ±, Œ≤ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM, Œ±(0) = Œ≤(0), ÀôŒ±(0) = ÀôŒ≤(0), ¬ØŒ±u(t) := PŒ±|[0,t](u), and
¬ØŒ≤u(t) := PŒ≤|[0,t](u) for u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ±(0)) and t ‚àà[0, 1], then
Àô¬ØŒ±(0) = Àô¬ØŒ≤(0).
(14.40)
The following theorem says that, when talking of a parallel transport, it is
insigniÔ¨Åcant whether we have in mind DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11 or DeÔ¨Ånition 14.9.
Theorem 14.3. The parallel transport P corresponding to a parallelism structure P
according to DeÔ¨Ånition 14.9 is a parallel transport in a sense of DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11.
Conversely, if P is a parallel transport according to DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11, then the
mapping P: (u, Œ≤) ‚ÜíPŒ≤
u, Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM, u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)), where the mapping
PŒ≤
u : [a, b] ‚ÜíE is given by
PŒ≤
u(t) = PŒ≤|[a,t],
(14.41)
is a parallelism structure such that the assigned to it parallel transport according to
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.9 coincides with P, i.e., given P, there is P generating it via (14.3).
Proof. Suppose P is a parallelism structure and P is the assigned to it parallel
transport. The properties (14.36) and (14.38) ware already established in Propo-
sitions 14.6 and 14.8, while (14.35), (14.37), and point (i) of DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11 are
valid due to DeÔ¨Ånition 14.1, condition (ii). The conditions (v) and (vi) of DeÔ¨Å-
nition 14.11 are simple reformulation of, respectively, conditions (iv) and (v) of
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.1.
Conversely, it is almost completely trivial to be veriÔ¨Åed that the mapping P
deÔ¨Åned via (14.41), in which P is a parallel transport according to DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11,
satisÔ¨Åes all of the conditions mentioned in DeÔ¨Ånition 14.1. For instance, (14.5)
follows from
PŒ≤‚ó¶œï
u
(s) = P(Œ≤‚ó¶œï)|[a,s](u) = PŒ≤|[œï(a),œï(s)] = PŒ≤
u(œï(s)),
s ‚àà[a, b],
while PŒ≤
u(a) = PŒ≤|[a,a](u) = u is a result of
PŒ≤p = idœÄ‚àí1(p),
Œ≤p : [a, a] = {a} ‚Üí{p} ‚ààM
(14.42)
which is a consequence of PŒ≤p = PŒ≤pŒ≤‚àí
p = PŒ≤‚àí
p ‚ó¶PŒ≤p = (PŒ≤p)‚àí1 ‚ó¶PŒ≤p = idœÄ‚àí1(p)
as Œ≤pŒ≤‚àí
p = Œ≤p = Œ≤‚àí
p . We leave to the reader to check the other properties. At
last, by (14.3), the parallel transport ¬ØP corresponding to P is given via ¬ØPŒ≤(u) :=
PŒ≤
u(b) = PŒ≤|[a,b](u) = PŒ≤(u) for every u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(a)) and Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM, which
means ¬ØP = P.
‚ñ°
The fundamental meaning of the last theorem is that the concept of a parallel
transport in a vector bundle is equivalent to the one of a parallelism structure in
it and, consequently, to the ones of connection on it or a covariant derivative in it.
In the present, as well as in the previous, subsection all mappings (manifolds,
and other structures) were supposed to be of classes C‚àû. This is suÔ¨Écient, but not

14. Connections and parallel transports
315
necessary for proving the results. Most of them remain valid when C1 or C2 (and
rarely C3) smoothness is supposed. To simplify the formulation of some results,
as well as to keep in touch with [23], further in this section we also suppose C‚àû
smoothness. But a careful reader can reformulate the material by counting the
necessary class of smoothness really required.
14.3.
Parallel transports and linear transports along paths
The main aim of this subsection is to be shown that the parallel transports can
be considered as linear transports along paths. Once this is proved, one can freely
apply the results, concerning normal frames for linear transports along paths,
to arbitrary parallel transports and, as a consequence of the results obtained, to
parallelism structures, connections and covariant derivatives in/on vector bundles.
Proposition 14.9. Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle and P be a parallel transport in
it. If Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, with J being R-interval, the mapping P : Œ≥ ‚ÜíP Œ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíP Œ≥
s‚Üít,
s, t ‚ààJ, such that
P Œ≥
s‚Üít =

PŒ≥|[s,t]
for s ‚â§t

PŒ≥|[t,s]‚àí1
for s ‚â•t ,
(14.43)
is a linear transport along paths in (E, œÄ, M).
Note 14.1. Compare this result with Proposition 11.1, as well as equation (14.43)
with (11.4a).
Proof. We have to check the conditions in DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 with P for L: equa-
tion (3.1) follows from (14.35), (3.3) is a consequence of (14.42), while (3.4) is true
as PŒ≥|[a,b], a, b ‚ààJ, a ‚â§b, is a vector space isomorphism between œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(a)) and
œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(b)). At last, (3.2) is a corollary of (14.38) as, for every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM,
Œ≥|[a, c] = (Œ≥|[a, c])|[a,b](Œ≥|[a, c])|[b,c] = Œ≥|[a,b]Œ≥|[b,c] for all a, b, c ‚ààJ such that
a ‚â§b ‚â§c (see (14.32)).
‚ñ°
Exercise 14.3. Prove that (14.43) is equivalent to
P Œ≥
s‚Üít = F ‚àí1(t, Œ≥) ‚ó¶F(s, Œ≥)
(14.43‚Ä≤)
where
F(r, Œ≥) :=

PŒ≥|[r,a]
for r ‚â§a

PŒ≥|[a,r]‚àí1
for r ‚â•a ,
r = s, t
for some Ô¨Åxed a ‚àà[min(s, t), max(s, t)]. (Hint: use the equality (14.32) and invoke
equation (14.38).) Then Proposition 14.9 follows from Proposition 3.1.
It is almost evident, (14.43) can be inverted, i.e., P can be expressed via P
(cf. (11.4b)):
PŒ≤ = P Œ≤
a‚Üíb
for Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM, a ‚â§b.
(14.44)

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Therefore the mapping P provides an equivalent description of the parallel trans-
port P, the only diÔ¨Äerence being that P is deÔ¨Åned along arbitrary paths Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM.
We shall call P parallel transport along paths if we want to emphasize its diÔ¨Äerence
from P but, if it is not important and there is not a risk of ambiguities, P will
simply be called parallel transport as P.
At this point a natural problem arises: when a linear transport along paths is
a parallel transport (along paths)? Since this problem is aside from our main topic
and its solution will not be used further in the present work, we shall consider it
quite brieÔ¨Çy.10 For the purpose one should, using (14.43) or (14.44), express all of
the properties of a parallel transport P mentioned in DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11 through the
parallel transport P along paths corresponding to P.
Lemma 14.1. If P is a linear transport along paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M)
and it satisÔ¨Åes the conditions
P Œ≥‚ó¶œï
s‚Üít = P Œ≥
œï(s)‚Üíœï(t),
s, t ‚ààJ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤,
(14.45)
where Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM and œï: J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíJ is orientation preserving diÔ¨Äeomorphism, and
P Œ≥|J‚Ä≤
s‚Üít = P Œ≥
s‚Üít,
s, t ‚ààJ‚Ä≤,
(14.46)
where J‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ is a subinterval, then the mapping P: Œ≤ ‚ÜíPŒ≤, Œ≤ : [a, b] ‚ÜíM, given
via (14.44) satisÔ¨Åes the conditions (14.35) and (i)‚Äì(iv) of DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11. Con-
versely, given a mapping P satisfying the last mentions conditions, the mapping
P : Œ≥ ‚ÜíP Œ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíP Œ≥
s‚Üít, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, s, t ‚ààJ, deÔ¨Åned via (14.43) is a linear
transport along paths possessing the properties (14.45) and (14.46).
Proof. Necessity: (14.35) follows from (3.1), (i) is a consequence of equations
(3.4) and (3.5), (14.36) is a corollary of (14.45), (14.37) is a result of (14.45) with
œï(t) = a + b ‚àít, t ‚àà[a, b] and (3.5), and, at last, in the proof of (14.38) the
conditions (14.46), (14.45) and (3.4) are involved: PŒ±Œ≤ = P Œ±Œ≤
c‚Üíb = P Œ±Œ≤
a‚Üíb ‚ó¶P Œ±Œ≤
c‚Üía =
P (Œ±Œ≤)|[a,b]
a‚Üíb
‚ó¶P (Œ±Œ≤)|[c,a]
c‚Üía
= P Œ≤
a‚Üíb ‚ó¶P Œ±
c‚Üía = PŒ≤ ‚ó¶PŒ±.
Sufficiency: The fact that P is a linear transport along paths was es-
tablished in Proposition 14.9 in which proof the conditions (v) and (vi) of Def-
inition 14.11 were not used. Taking for deÔ¨Åniteness s ‚â§t, the proof of (14.45)
and (14.46) is respectively:
P Œ≥‚ó¶œï
s‚Üít = P(Œ≥‚ó¶œï)|[s,t] = PŒ≥|[œï(s),œï(t)] = P Œ≥
œï(s)‚Üíœï(t)
P Œ≥|J‚Ä≤
s‚Üít , = P(Œ≥|J‚Ä≤)|[s,t] = PŒ≥|[s,t] = P Œ≥
s‚Üít.
The case s ‚â•t can be proved similarly.
‚ñ°
10For some details and a more general discussion of the situation, see [115] and Section V.8
below.

14. Connections and parallel transports
317
Theorem 14.4. If P is a parallel transport, then the mapping P : Œ≥ ‚ÜíP Œ≥ : (s, t) ‚Üí
P Œ≥
s‚Üít, Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, s, t ‚ààJ, deÔ¨Åned by (14.43) is a linear transport along paths
satisfying (14.45), (14.46) and the conditions:
(a) under the hypotheses preceding (14.6) in condition (iv) of DeÔ¨Ånition 14.1, the
mapping
Àúf : T (U) √ó œÄ‚àí1(U) ‚ÜíE,
Àúf : (X, u) ‚ÜíP Œ±
0‚Üí1(u),
Œ±(s) := f(sX),
(14.47)
where (X, u) ‚ààT (U) √ó œÄ‚àí1(U) and s ‚àà[0, 1], is of class C‚àû;
(b) if Œ±, Œ≤ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM, Œ±(0) = Œ≤(0), ÀôŒ±(0) =
ÀôŒ≤(0), ¬ØŒ±u(t) := P Œ±
0‚Üít(u), and
¬ØŒ≤u(t) := P Œ≤
0‚Üít(u) for u ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ±(0)) and t ‚àà[0, 1], then
Àô¬ØŒ±(0) = Àô¬ØŒ≤(0).
(14.48)
Besides, the corresponding to P via (14.44) mapping is a parallel transport co-
inciding with P. Conversely, if P is a linear transport along paths satisfying the
conditions (14.45)‚Äì(14.48), the mapping P: Œ≤ ‚ÜíPŒ≤ given via (14.43) is a parallel
transport along paths; moreover, the corresponding to P via (14.43) linear transport
along paths coincides with P.
Proof. See Lemma 14.1 and reformulate conditions (v) and (vi) of DeÔ¨Ånition 14.11
in terms of the mapping P.
‚ñ°
Thus we can make two important conclusions:
Conclusion 14.2. The parallel transports along paths are the only linear transports
along paths having the special properties (14.45)‚Äì(14.48).
Therefore, we can give the following deÔ¨Ånition of a parallel transport along
paths which, by Theorem 14.4 is equivalent to the one presented above.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.12. A parallel transport along paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) is
a linear transport along paths in it satisfying the conditions (14.45)‚Äì(14.48).
Conclusion 14.3. The parallel transports along paths provide an equivalent descrip-
tion of the parallel transports and, consequently, of the parallelism structures, con-
nections, and covariant derivatives. Therefore any result concerning linear trans-
ports along paths, in general, or parallel transports along pats, in particular, can
mutatis mutandis be formulated equivalently in terms of parallel transports, par-
allelism structures, connections, or covariant derivatives.
Let ‚àág be a covariant derivative in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) along g: N ‚Üí
M and Œì¬µ( ¬∑ ; g) =

Œìi
j¬µ( ¬∑ ; g)

be the matrix of its coeÔ¨Écients in a pair of frames
({E¬µ}, {ei}), over a set U √ó g(U) ‚äÜN √ó M, {E¬µ} being a frame in T (N) over
U ‚äÜN and {ei} being a frame over g(U) in E.
Comparing the transformation equations (14.25) on page 310 and (6.4) on
page 248, or equivalently (14.24) and (6.5), one can notice from the Ô¨Årst sight a

318
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
striking similarity between them: the only formal diÔ¨Äerence being that in equa-
tion (14.25) the indices ¬µ, ŒΩ, . . . run from 1 to dim N and the matrix-valued func-
tion A( ¬∑ ; g): U ‚ÜíGL(dim(œÄ‚àí1(p)), K), U ‚äÜN, p ‚ààM, stands for A: W ‚Üí
GL(dim(œÄ‚àí1(p)), K), W ‚äÜM. This analogy is a hint to be considered the quan-
tities (cf. (6.1))
Œì(s; Œ≥, g) :=

Œìi

(14.49)
where Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN is a C1 path and s ‚ààJ, which under a change ({E¬µ}, {ei}) ‚Üí
({E‚Ä≤
¬µ = BŒΩ

Œì‚Ä≤(s; Œ≥, g) = A‚àí1(Œ≥(s); g)Œì(Œ≥(s); g)A(Œ≥(s); g) + A‚àí1(Œ≥(s); g)‚àÇA(Œ≥(s); g)
‚àÇs
. (14.50)
Prima facie one may think, relying on the Proposition 3.6 on page 232, that
there is a (unique) linear transport along paths in some bundle over N whose 2-
index coeÔ¨Écient matrix is Œì(s; Œ≥, g). To clarify the situation, it must be emphasized
on the fact that the path Œ≥ is in N (not in M) while the ‚Äòtransport‚Äô should act
between some of the Ô¨Åbres of (E, œÄ, M), viz. the ones over g(N). Hence the bundle
in which the hypothetical transport should act must have N as a base while its
bundle space must be a subspace of E, viz. œÄ‚àí1(g(N)). Besides, the Ô¨Åbre over
q ‚ààN must be œÄ‚àí1(g(q)). This is admissible iÔ¨Äg is injective, g(q1) Ã∏= g(q2) for
each q1, q2 ‚ààN such that q1 Ã∏= q2, in which case g is bijective on the image g(N)
and vice versa, i.e., if g: N ‚ÜíM is C‚àûand g|N : N ‚Üíg(N) is bijection.
The results obtained in the above analysis can be summarized in the following
assertion.
Proposition 14.10. Let ‚àág be a covariant derivative in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M)
along an injective mapping g: N ‚ÜíM and g‚àí1 : g(N) ‚ÜíN be the inverse of g on
the image g(N) ‚äÜM. If Œì¬µ( ¬∑ , g) are the coeÔ¨Écients‚Äô matrices of ‚àág in a pair of
frames ({E¬µ}, {ei}), then there exists a unique linear transport gP along paths in
the vector bundle (œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), œÄN, N) with œÄN := g‚àí1 ‚ó¶(œÄ|œÄ‚àí1(g(N))) such that in
{ei} the matrix of its (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients is given by (14.49) for every C1 path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN or, equivalently, such that in ({E¬µ}, {ei}) its 3-index coeÔ¨Écients coin-
cide with the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àág. Conversely, to every linear transport along paths
in (œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), œÄN, N) with given 3-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
j¬µ( ¬∑ ; g), there corresponds
a unique covariant derivative ‚àág in (E, œÄ, M) with coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
j¬µ( ¬∑ ; g).
Proof. See the above discussion, Proposition 3.6 on page 232, and the deÔ¨Ånition
of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of a linear transport along paths in Section 6.

Remark 14.6. Notice, in the case N = M and g = idM, i.e., when a covariant
derivative in (E, œÄ, M) is considered, the bundle (œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), œÄN, N), in which
the transport gP determined by Proposition 14.9 acts, coincides with the initial
bundle (E, œÄ, M).
Proposition 14.11 (cf. Proposition 11.4). Let gD be the derivation along paths cor-
responding via (3.19) to the linear transport
gP along paths described in Propo-
sition 14.10. If Xg is a lifting of g to E and ÀÜXg is a lifting of the paths in N to
œÄ‚àí1(N) in the bundle (œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), œÄN, N) such that ÀÜXg : Œ≥ ‚ÜíXg ‚ó¶Œ≥ for every C1
path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN, then, for each s ‚ààJ,
 gDŒ≥( ÀÜXg)

(s) := gDŒ≥
s( ÀÜXg) =

‚àág
ÀôŒ≥(Xg)

(Œ≥(s)).
(14.51)
Proof. Invoke (3.23), (14.18), and (14.49).
‚ñ°
Remark 14.7. In a case of a covariant derivative ‚àáin (E, œÄ, M), i.e., for N =
M and g = idM, equation (14.51) reads DŒ≥
s ( ÀÜ
X) = (‚àáÀôŒ≥(X))|Œ≥(s) for every X ‚àà
Sec(E, œÄ, M) and ÀÜX ‚ààPLift(E, œÄ, M) such that ÀÜX : Œ≥ ‚Üí
ÀÜXŒ≥ : s ‚ÜíXŒ≥(s). In
the tangent bundle case, (E, œÄ, M) = (T (M), œÄ, M), the last equality is identical
with (11.6).
The above result, combined with Proposition 11.4 on page 283 is a tip for the
existence of some connection between gP and the parallel transport determined
by ‚àág.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.13 (see DeÔ¨Ånitions 14.2 and 14.8). Suppose the symbols (E, œÄ, M),
N, g, ‚àág, and gP have the same meaning as in Proposition 14.10. A path ¬ØŒ≥ : J ‚Üí
œÄ‚àí1(g(N)) ‚äÜE is called parallel (along Œ≥ := œÄN ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥ : J ‚ÜíN) with respect to ‚àág if
¬ØŒ≥(t) = gP Œ≥
s‚Üít¬ØŒ≥(s)
(14.52)
for some (and hence for any) s ‚ààJ and all t ‚ààJ; respectively, in this case ¬ØŒ≥
is called a parallel (along Œ≥ with respect to ‚àág) lifting of Œ≥. A lifting Œª of the
paths in N to paths in œÄ‚àí1(g(N)) is called parallel with respect to ‚àág if for any
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN, the path ŒªŒ≥, Œª: Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒªŒ≥, is parallel along Œ≥ with respect to ‚àág. A
section œÉ ‚ààSec(œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), œÄN, N) is parallel along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN (resp. on U ‚äÜN)
with respect to ‚àág, if the lifting ÀÜœÉ: Œ≥ ‚ÜíÀÜœÉŒ≥ = œÉ ‚ó¶Œ≥ is parallel along the given path
Œ≥ (resp. along every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíU) with respect to ‚àág.
Proposition 14.12. Let ‚àág and
gP be as in Proposition 14.10. A lifting Xg ‚àà
Liftg(E, œÄ, M) is parallel (resp. along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN) with respect to ‚àág if and only if
the lifting of paths ÀÜXg ‚ààPLift(œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), œÄN, N) with ÀÜXg : Œ≥ ‚ÜíXg ‚ó¶Œ≥ , Œ≥ : J ‚Üí
N, is parallel on N (resp. along the given path Œ≥) with respect to ‚àág.
Proof. See DeÔ¨Ånitions 14.8 and 14.13 and use (3.21), on page 231, and (14.51). ‚ñ°
So, allowing some freedom of the language, we can say that equation (14.52)
describes, besides the parallel paths in œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), also the parallel sections of
(œÄ‚àí1(g(N)), œÄN, N), and the parallel liftings of g to E ‚äáœÄ‚àí1(g(N)).

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Proposition 14.13. Let ‚àábe a covariant derivative in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M)
and P be the determined by it parallelism stricture according to Corollary 14.1 on
page 306. The linear transport
idMP along paths in (E, œÄ, M) determined by ‚àá
according to Proposition 14.10 (with N = M and g = idM) coincides with the
parallel transport P along paths corresponding to P via (14.3) and (14.43), i.e.,
P = idMP.
Proof. Let Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM be a C1 path, s0 ‚ààJ, and u0 ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)). We have to
show that the liftings ¬ØŒ≥ and ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ : J ‚ÜíE of Œ≥, given via
¬ØŒ≥(t) := P Œ≥
s0‚Üít(u0),
¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤(t) := idMP
Œ≥
s0‚Üít(u0),
t ‚ààJ
are identical, ¬ØŒ≥ = ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤. It is trivial to see, the path ¬ØŒ≥ is parallel with respect to
P (see DeÔ¨Ånition 14.2). Therefore, by Corollary 14.1, ‚àáÀôŒ≥¬ØŒ≥ = 0 or, in component
form (see (14.14) or (14.26‚Ä≤))
d¬ØŒ≥i(t)
dt
+ Œìi
j¬µ(Œ≥(t))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t) = 0
(14.53)
where Œìi
j¬µ are simultaneously 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of P and coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àá(see
Proposition 14.10). According to (3.20) and (3.21), the path ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ satisÔ¨Åes the equa-
tion DŒ≥
t ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ = 0, D being the derivation along paths generated by
idMP (see Def-
inition 3.2 on page 230), which, due to (3.23) and (6.1), coincides with (14.53)
with ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ for ¬ØŒ≥. Hence (the components of) ¬ØŒ≥ and ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ are solutions of identical
Ô¨Årst order ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equations passing through one and the same point
u0 = ¬ØŒ≥(s0) = ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤(s0). Consequently, by the uniqueness of the solutions of such
equations, ¬ØŒ≥ = ¬ØŒ≥ ‚Ä≤, which, due to the arbitrariness of Œ≥, s0, and u0, implies
P = idMP.

14.4.
Normal frames for parallel transports,
connections and covariant derivatives
The conclusions made in the previous subsection enable all of the general results
and deÔ¨Ånitions related to linear transports along paths in vector bundles to be
transferred, with appropriate changes, to the theory of connections, parallelism
structures, parallel transports, and covariant derivatives in/on these bundles. In
particular, such a procedure can be realized with respect to the theory of normal
frames (and, possibly, coordinates) for linear transports along paths. Below we
turn our attention to its brief description. To save some space and writing, we
shall perform it with respect to the parallel transports (along paths) and covariant
derivatives, which are most suitable for our purposes, but, applying Theorems 14.1,
14.2, 14.3, and 14.4, one can reformulate the material in terms of parallelism
structures or connections.
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.14 (see DeÔ¨Ånitions 4.1‚Äì4.4). Let P be a parallel transport along
paths in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M). A frame normal for P along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM

14. Connections and parallel transports
321
(resp. on U ‚äÜM) is called normal along Œ≥ (resp. on U) for the parallel transport
P, parallelism structure P, or/and connection T h(E) determined by it. If such
frames exist, P, P, P, and/ or T h(E) are called Euclidean along Œ≥ (resp. on U).
A frame strong normal for P (on an open set containing or equal to U) is called
strong normal for P, P, and/or T h(E).
DeÔ¨Ånition 14.15 (cf. DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.1). Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle, g: N ‚Üí
M, ‚àág be a covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M) along g, and U ‚äÜN, where E, M,
and N are manifolds. A frame {ei} in E, deÔ¨Åned over an open set containing or
equal to g(U), is called normal for ‚àág on U, if for some (and hence for any ‚Äì
see (14.25) or Conclusion 14.5 below) frame {E¬µ} in T (N) over U, the coeÔ¨Écients
of ‚àág in the pair of frames ({E¬µ}, {ei}) vanish everywhere on U. Respectively, a
frame {ei} is normal for ‚àág along œï: Q ‚ÜíN, Q Ã∏= ‚àÖ, if it is normal on œï(Q) ‚äÜN.
Obviously, it is valid
Conclusion 14.4. DeÔ¨Ånition 14.14 transfers all problems concerning frames normal
for parallelism structures, parallel transports, and connections to similar problems
for a special type of linear transports along paths, viz. to the parallel transports
along paths, to which are applicable all of the results from Sections 3‚Äì9.
As a result of this conclusion, we are not going to consider the mentioned
in it type of problems here. Of course, the additional conditions (14.45)‚Äì(14.48),
singling out the parallel transports along paths from the other linear transports
along paths, lead to some speciÔ¨Åc properties of the corresponding normal frames.
But their concrete description is out of the main subject of the present book.
However, below some of these special properties will be described (implicitly)
when frames normal for covariant derivatives will be explored.
Let us now turn our attention to the frames normal for covariant derivatives.
We distinguish these frames from the ones described by DeÔ¨Ånition 14.14 because
the class of these frames is, generally, larger than the one of the letter. As we
shall see below, a frame normal for a covariant derivative ‚àáin a vector bundle is
strongly normal for the corresponding to ‚àá(or determining ‚àá) parallel transport
P along paths. The relations between the frames normal for ‚àáand P is similar to
the ones described in Section 12 in the case of linear connections on a manifold.
Suppose (E, œÄ, M) is a vector bundle, g: N ‚ÜíM is of class C‚àû, ‚àág is a
covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M) along g, U ‚äÜN, {E¬µ|¬µ = 1, . . . , dim N} is a
frame over U in T (N), and {ei|i = 1, . . . , dim œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààM} is a frame over
an open set V containing or equal to g(U) ‚äÜM in E. Let B = [BŒΩ
¬µ]dim N
¬µ,ŒΩ=1 and
A = [Aj
i ]dim œÄ‚àí1(p)
i,j=1
, be non-degenerate matrix-valued functions on V and g(V ),
respectively, and A be of class C1. The frame {e‚Ä≤
i = Aj
iej} over V ‚äág(U) in E
is normal for ‚àág on U iÔ¨Äthere can be found A and B such that in the pair of
frames ({E¬µ}, {ei}) the coeÔ¨Écients Œì‚Ä≤ i
j¬µ of ‚àág vanish on U. According to the
transformation law (14.25), the frame {e‚Ä≤
i} is normal for ‚àág on U iÔ¨Äthe normal

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
frame equation (cf. (I.5.4) on page 39 or (12.6) on page 291)
(Œì¬µ( ¬∑ ; g)A + E¬µ(A))|U = 0
(14.54)
holds. From here two quite fundamental conclusions can be made:
Conclusion 14.5. The choice of the frame {E¬µ} over U in T (N) involved in the
deÔ¨Ånition of a frame normal for a covariant derivative along a mapping is com-
pletely insigniÔ¨Åcant (see (14.54) and (14.25)): a frame normal for one such choice is
normal for any other choice. From general positions, this choice may be important
only when one tries to solve equation (14.54) with respect to A as it may lead to
a simpliÔ¨Åcation as well as to a complication of the concrete form of the equation.
So, it is a matter of convenience to select a particular frame {E¬µ} when exploring
frames normal for covariant derivatives along mappings.
Conclusion 14.6. The more important result is that (14.54) is identical with
equation (12.6) (with ¬µ = 1, . . . , dim N while in Section 12 is supposed ¬µ =
1, . . . , dim M) describing the frames strongly normal on U for linear transports
along paths with Ô¨Åxed 3-index coeÔ¨Écients. Therefore the discussion after (12.6) in
Section 12 can be repeated word by word if we replace in it the base manifold M
with the manifold N (which is the domain of the mapping g: N ‚ÜíM along which
is the covariant derivative ‚àág) and the phrase ‚Äúframe(s) (strong) normal on . . .
for . . . ‚Äù with ‚Äúframe(s) normal for ‚àág‚Äù. In short, this results in the conclusion
that all of the results of Chapter III (or II) concerning the solution of the matrix
equation (14.54) are mutatis mutandis valid with respect to frames normal for
covariant derivatives along mappings.
In particular, we can assert the existence of frames normal at any Ô¨Åxed point
q ‚ààN, i.e., for U = {q}, or along any C1 locally injective path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíN,
i.e., for U = Œ≥(J); also the frames normal on U, if any, are connected via linear
transformations such that their matrices A satisfy the equation E¬µ(A)|U = 0 for
some (and hence any) frame {E¬µ} in T (N) over an open set containing or equal
to U, etc.
Thus the general, and possibly unexpected, inference is encoded in
Conclusion 14.7. The methods developed for the investigation of frames normal
for linear connections on manifolds and the ones for linear transports along paths
in vector bundles are completely applicable for the exploration of frames normal
for covariant derivatives along mappings and frames strongly normal for linear
transports along paths; moreover, all kinds of problems concerning the last two
types of frames can be solved by the methods mentioned.
This conclusion is in full agreement with the ones at the end of the last
paragraph of Section 8 and with Remark 8.1 on page 259.
Now it is time to formulate and solve the problem: what are the links between
frames normal for a covariant derivative and the determined by (or determining
it) parallel transport?

14. Connections and parallel transports
323
Proposition 14.14. Let ‚àág and
gP be as in Proposition 14.9 on page 315. The
frames normal on U ‚äÜN for ‚àág are strong normal on U for gP and vice versa.
Proof. See DeÔ¨Ånitions 14.15 and 12.2 and invoke Proposition 14.9.

14.5.
On the role of the curvature
This subsection shows that the curvature of a connection (or parallel transport or
covariant derivative) plays with respect to the normal frames the same role as the
curvature of a linear connection (transport) with respect to this kind of frames.
The curvature tensor Ô¨Åeld or simply curvature of a connection T h(E) on a
vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) is a mapping [23, Section 2.43]
R: X(M) √ó X(M) √ó E ‚ÜíE
such that, given U, V ‚ààX(M) and Œæ ‚ààE,
R: (U, V, Œæ) ‚ÜíR(U, V )Œæ := ‚àípr2

([ ¬ØU, ¬ØV ] )v
Œæ

.
(14.55)
Here: pr2 : T v(E) ‚ÜíE was deÔ¨Åned on page 306, ¬ØU and ¬ØV are the horizontal
liftings to E of U and V respectively (see DeÔ¨Ånition 14.6), ([ ¬ØU, ¬ØV ] )Œæ is the com-
mutator of ¬ØU and ¬ØV at Œæ, and the superscript v denotes the vertical compo-
nent of a vector in T (E) with respect to T h(E). If X ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M), we set
R(U, V )X ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) with (R(U, V )X)(p) := R(U, V )(X(p)), p ‚ààM.
For us will be important that R is tensorial in all its three arguments, it is
skewsymmetric in the Ô¨Årst two arguments, and, if ‚àáis a covariant derivative in
(E, œÄ, M) which determines T h(E), then11
R(U, V )X =

R‚àá(U, V )

(X) ‚â°R‚àá(U, V )X
(14.56)
where X ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) and R‚àá: Sec(E, œÄ, M) ‚ÜíSec(E, œÄ, M) is a mapping
given by
R‚àá(U, V ) := [‚àáU, ‚àáV ] ‚àí‚àá[U,V ] = ‚àáU ‚ó¶‚àáV ‚àí‚àáV ‚ó¶‚àáU ‚àí‚àá[U,V ]
(14.57)
and it is called curvature (operator) of the covariant derivative ‚àá. Notice, in the
tangent bundle case, (E, œÄ, M) = (T (M), œÄ, M), the last formula reduces to the
DeÔ¨Ånition (I.3.11) on page 25, as one can expect.
Let {EŒ±|Œ± = 1, . . . , dim M} be a frame in T (M) over a set W ‚äÜM and
{ei|i = 1, . . . , dim œÄ‚àí1(p), p ‚ààM} be a frame in E over W. The components
Ri
jŒ±Œ≤ and (R‚àá)
i
jŒ±Œ≤ of the curvatures R and R‚àá, respectively, are deÔ¨Åned by
R(EŒ±, EŒ≤)ej =: Ri
jŒ±Œ≤ei,
R‚àá(EŒ±, EŒ≤)ej =: (R‚àá)
i
jŒ±Œ≤ei.
Obviously, due to (14.56), if ‚àáinduces T h(E), then Ri
jŒ±Œ≤ = (R‚àá)
i
jŒ±Œ≤
11For the proof of these assertions, as well as for other properties of the curvature, see [23,
p. 67 Ô¨Äand p. 82 Ô¨Ä].

Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
Exercise 14.4. Let R‚àábe the curvature of a covariant derivative in a vector bundle

where [EŒ±, EŒ≤] =: C¬µ

Proposition 14.15. Let ‚àábe a covariant derivative in a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M)
and P be the corresponding to it unique linear transport along paths according
to Propositions 14.10 (which coincides with the parallel transport assigned to the
parallelism structure P described in Corollary 14.1). The components (R‚àá)
i
jŒ±Œ≤ of
the curvature R‚àáof ‚àácoincide with the 4-index components Ri
jŒ±Œ≤ of the curvature
of P (deÔ¨Åned by (9.13) in Proposition 9.1 on page 265):
(R‚àá)
i
jŒ±Œ≤ = Ri
jŒ±Œ≤.
(14.59)
Moreover, if
sR is the curvature of the section-derivation corresponding to the
derivation along paths generated by P (see Subsection 9.1), then

p =

(14.60)
where: U, V ‚ààX(M), X ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M), p ‚ààM, Œ∑: J √ó J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíM is of class
C2, Œ∑(s0, t0) = p for some (s0, t0) ‚ààJ √ó J‚Ä≤, Œ∑‚Ä≤(s0, t0) = Up and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s0, t0) =
Vp with Œ∑‚Ä≤( ¬∑ , t0) and Œ∑‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(s0, ¬∑ ) being the tangent vectors to Œ∑( ¬∑ , t0) and Œ∑(s0, ¬∑ ),
respectively.
Proof. Equation (14.59) follows from (14.58), (9.13), and the coincidence of the
coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáand the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of P (by Proposition 14.10). To verify
the relation (14.60), one should simply repeat the derivation of equality (9.17) on
page 267 with the only diÔ¨Äerence that now ‚àáis a covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M)
and (E, œÄ, M) should stand for the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M).
‚ñ°
Call a connection, covariant derivative, or parallel transport (along paths) Ô¨Çat
(on W ‚äÜM) if their curvatures vanish (on W). If a connection, covariant deriva-
tive, and parallel transport (along paths) are connected as above supposed, then
the results obtained demonstrate that the Ô¨Çatness of one of these three quantities
implies the Ô¨Çatness of the remaining two of them.
Of course, all general results of Section 9, in particular the ones connecting
curvature and normal frames, are completely applicable to the parallel transports
along paths in vector bundles as they are a special type of linear transports along
paths (Theorem 14.4 on page 317). But Proposition 14.15, combined with the
results of Subsection 14.4, permits something more:
Conclusion 14.8. The material of Section 11, excluding the one concerning torsion
and normal coordinates, can mutatis mutandis, practically in extenso, be general-
ized to the case of parallel transports (along paths) in general vector bundles. To

15.
Autoparallel paths
325
this end one should replace the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M) with a vector bundle
(E, œÄ, M), the linear connection ‚àáon M with a connection ‚àáin (E, œÄ, M), and
to make some other, not so important changes.
This transferring of results is so trivial that the explicit formulation of the
corresponding assertions makes sense if they are really required for some purpose.
Exercise 14.5. Reformulate some important inferences of Section 11, such as the
analogues of Propositions 11.1‚Äì11.4 and 11.9‚Äì11.11, for parallel transports (along
paths) in general vector bundles.
A partial generalization to arbitrary vector bundles admits the material of
Section 13, but this is almost out of the subject of this book.
15.
Autoparallel paths
The geodesics in a C2 manifold M endowed with a C0 linear connection ‚àáare C1
paths whose tangent vector undergoes parallel transport along them by means of
the parallel transport P assigned to ‚àá(see DeÔ¨Ånition I.3.5 on page 30). If P is
the parallel transport along paths corresponding to P via (11.4a), then a C1 path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is geodesic iÔ¨Ä
ÀôŒ≥(s) = P Œ≥
s0‚Üís ÀôŒ≥(s0)
(15.1)
for some (and hence any) s0 ‚ààJ and all s ‚ààJ, by virtue of (I.3.20). Obviously, this
equality can be taken as a base for a new, but equivalent, deÔ¨Ånition of a geodesic
path.
Denote by P ‚ààPLift(T (M), œÄ, M) the lifting of paths generated by P via
equation (3.20) with u0 = ÀôŒ≥(s0) and P for L, viz., for some s0 ‚ààJ,
P : Œ≥ ‚ÜíPŒ≥ : s ‚ÜíPŒ≥(s) := P Œ≥
s0‚Üís ÀôŒ≥(s0).
(15.2)
Evidently, the equality (15.1) is equivalent to
PŒ≥ = ÀôŒ≥,
(15.3)
where ÀôŒ≥ : s ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s) is considered as a lifting of Œ≥ to T (M).
If œÑ ‚ààPLift(T (M), œÄ, M) denotes the lifting of paths
œÑ : Œ≥ ‚ÜíœÑŒ≥ := ÀôŒ≥,
(15.4)
which may be called tangent lifting of paths, the equality (15.3) is tantamount to
‚àáD
Œ≥œÑ = 0
(15.5)
as a result of the equality (3.21) on page 231. Here
‚àáD is the derivation along
paths in (T (M), œÄ, M) generated by P via (3.19). Its components Œìi
j coincide

326
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
with the coeÔ¨Écients of P (Proposition 3.7 on page 233) and along Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM in a
frame {Ei} in T (M) over Œ≥(J) are
Œìi
j(s; Œ≥) = Œìi
jk(Œ≥(s))ÀôŒ≥k(s),
s ‚ààJ
(15.6)
where Œìi
jk are the coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àáin {Ei} (see, e.g., Propositions 11.3 and 11.4).
The above conclusions can be summarized in the following assertion.
Proposition 15.1. A C1 path in a C2 manifold endowed with C0 linear connection
is geodesic if and only if it satisÔ¨Åes any one (and hence all) of the equivalent
equations (15.1), (15.3) and (15.5).
Remark 15.1. Applying equation (3.23) on page 231 one can prove that, due
to (15.4) and (15.6), the equation (15.5) is an equivalent invariant form of the
equation (I.3.22) of geodesic paths (see also equations (15.11) and (15.12) below).
Thus (15.1), (15.3) and (15.5) are equivalent versions of the geodesic equation.
Also the equation (15.5) is a rigorous version of (I.3.21) on page 30 for arbitrary,
with or without self-intersections, paths (see Remark I.3.8 on page 31): if Œ≥ is not
injective, one should deÔ¨Åne the symbol ‚àáÀôŒ≥ ÀôŒ≥ as ‚àáD
Œ≥œÑ, ‚àáÀôŒ≥ ÀôŒ≥ := ‚àáD
Œ≥œÑ, otherwise,
for an injective path Œ≥, the lifting ÀôŒ≥ of Œ≥ is equivalent to a vector Ô¨Åeld Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíÀôŒ≥(s)
on Œ≥(J) and ‚àáÀôŒ≥ ÀôŒ≥ has its usual meaning if we identify this Ô¨Åeld with ÀôŒ≥.
One should observe, in (15.1), (15.3), and (15.5) are involved only the parallel
transport P along paths and the generated by it derivation along paths ‚àáD, not
directly the linear connection ‚àá. This observation hints to the existence of a gen-
eralization of the concept of geodesic paths to more general ones when P is replace
with arbitrary linear transport along paths in the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M)
over M. The following deÔ¨Ånition is a rigorous realization of such an idea.
DeÔ¨Ånition 15.1. Let M be a C2 manifold and L be a C0 linear transport along
paths in its tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M). Call a C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM autoparallel
with respect to L if
ÀôŒ≥(s) = LŒ≥
so‚Üís(ÀôŒ≥(s0))
(15.7)
for some (and hence any) s0 ‚ààJ and all s ‚ààJ.
Remark 15.2. For other meaning of the term ‚Äòautoparallel path‚Äô, see Remark I.3.7
on page 30.
Proposition 15.2. The autoparallel paths with respect to a parallel transport along
paths generated by a linear connection coincide with the geodesics of this connec-
tion.
Proof. Compare (15.1) with (15.7) and invoke Proposition 15.1.
‚ñ°
Similarly to the above considerations, we can rewrite (15.7) as
LŒ≥ = ÀôŒ≥
(15.8)
or
DŒ≥œÑ = 0
(15.9)

where
L: Œ≥ ‚ÜíLŒ≥ : s ‚ÜíLŒ≥(s) := LŒ≥
s0‚Üís ÀôŒ≥(s0),
(15.10)
œÑ is the tangent lifting of paths given via (15.4), and D is the derivation along
paths generated by L via (3.19). The derivation of these equations is in fact the
proof of the following proposition (cf. Proposition 15.1).
Proposition 15.3. A C1 path Œ≥ in C2 manifold is autoparallel with respect to a C0
linear transport along paths in the tangent bundle over that manifold if and only
if for it any one (and hence both) of the equivalent conditions (15.8) and (15.9) is
(are) valid.
From practical view-point, the equation of autoparallels (15.9) is quite suit-
able for the study of the (local) properties of the autoparallels. In particular this
concerns its representation in a frame {Ei} along Œ≥ in T (M). As a consequence
of (3.23) on page 231 with Œª = œÑ and (15.4), in {Ei}, the equation (15.9) is
equivalent to
dÀôŒ≥i(s)
ds
+ Œìi
j(s; Œ≥)ÀôŒ≥j(s) = 0
(15.11)
where Œìi
j are the (local) coeÔ¨Écients of the transport L in {Ei}. In the special case
when {Ei} is the frame induced by some local coordinates {xi}, Ei =
‚àÇ
‚àÇxi , the last
equation transforms into
d2Œ≥i(s)
ds2
+ Œìi
j(s; Œ≥)dŒ≥j(s)
ds
= 0
(15.12)
where s ‚ààJ must be such that Œ≥(s) is in the domain of {xi} and Œ≥i := xi ‚ó¶Œ≥.
In the case of a parallel transport, L = P when (15.6) holds, equations (15.11)
and (15.12) reduce, respectively, to the equations (I.3.22) and (I.3.23) of the
geodesics. Therefore they, as well as (15.9), should be called equation(s) of the
autoparallel paths. It is clear, the equation of the autoparallels is a system of or-
dinary diÔ¨Äerential equations with respect to the local coordinates of the paths (in
some local coordinates). The concrete order and type of this system depends on
the transport L through its coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
j. The investigation of the autoparallels‚Äô
equation is out of the subject of our work. Below we present only one (almost
trivial) result that generalizes the well know theorem that the geodesics are de-
scribed via linear equations in normal coordinates (see the paragraph containing
equation (II.2.15) on page 83 or, e.g., [11, Chapter III, Proposition 8.3]).
Proposition 15.4. Let M be C2 manifold and L be a C0 linear transport along
paths in its tangent bundle (T (M), œÄ, M). Suppose L admits an autoparallel path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM such that LŒ≥
s‚Üít = idœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) for all s, t ‚ààJ with Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t), i.e., the
mapping Œ≥(s) ‚ÜíLŒ≥(s) = ÀôŒ≥(s) (see (15.10) or (15.9)) is a single-valued vector Ô¨Åeld
over Œ≥(J). Then, in any frame {Ei} normal along Œ≥ for L, the components ÀôŒ≥i(s)
of ÀôŒ≥(s) ‚ààTŒ≥(s)(M) are constant, i.e., we have
ÀôŒ≥(s) = aiEi
(15.13)

328
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
for some numbers ai ‚ààK. Besides, if L is torsionless, Œ≥ is injective and (V, x) is
a chart normal along Œ≥ for L, then
xi(Œ≥(s)) = ais + bi,
ÀôŒ≥(s) = ai ‚àÇ
‚àÇxi
(15.14)
where {xi} is the associated to (V, x) normal coordinate system, s ‚ààJ is such that
Œ≥(s) ‚ààV , and ai, bi ‚ààK are constant numbers.
Remark 15.3. The condition LŒ≥
s‚Üít = idœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) for all s, t ‚ààJ with Œ≥(s) = Œ≥(t),
by Proposition 5.2 on page 240, is a criterion for the existence of frames normal
along Œ≥ while, by Proposition 10.7, the torsionless of L and the injectiveness of Œ≥
ensure the existence of coordinates normal along Œ≥.
Proof. Recall, by deÔ¨Ånition, the coeÔ¨Écients Œìi
j of L vanish in a normal frame or
in normal coordinates. So, evidently, (15.13) (resp. (15.14)) is the general solution
of the equations of autoparallels (15.11) (resp. (15.12)) in a normal frame (resp.
normal coordinate system {xi}).
‚ñ°
Consequently, in the sense of Proposition 15.4, the autoparallel paths in a
manifold with a transport in its tangent bundle are the analogues of the straight
lines (resp. geodesics) in a Euclidean space En (resp. manifold with a linear con-
nection).

On a Ô¨Åbre bundle view at quantum mechanics
The purpose of this section is to be given an idea of the Ô¨Åbre bundle formulation
of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics which essentially employs the theory of lin-
ear transports along paths in vector bundles; the reader can Ô¨Ånd in [127‚Äì131] a
detailed exposition of this approach to quantum mechanics. In particular, it will
be demonstrated below that the bundle Schr¬®odinger and Heisenberg pictures of
motion are (locally) identical in a suitable normal frame
The reader should be aware that some of the considerations below will not
be quite rigorous from mathematical view-point. This is a result of the fact that
Hilbert bundles of generally inÔ¨Ånite Ô¨Åbre dimension will be used. Correspondingly,
we will be dealing with inÔ¨Ånite matrices applying the rules known from the theory
of Ô¨Ånite matrices, which is a common practice in quantum mechanics [68,133‚Äì135]
but such an approach requires additional investigation and even may turn to be
wrong sometimes [126] (see also [136] and [135, Chapter 7, Section 18]).
Before going on, we shall make a technical remark. The (Ô¨Åbre) indices below
can take discrete and/or continuous values depending on the spectrum of the
corresponding operators (the Hamiltonian in the particular case). For that reason,
sums like Œªiei(x) must be understood as 
i‚ààŒõd Œªiei(x) +
(
i‚ààŒõc Œªiei(x) di, where
Œõd (resp. Œõc) is the set of discrete (resp. continuous) values the index i can take.
For more details on this item, see [128, p. 4921].

16. On a Ô¨Åbre bundle view at quantum mechanics
329
In the bundle approach to quantum mechanics, to a quantum system is as-
signed a unique C1 Hilbert bundle (F, œÄ, M), M being a C1 manifold, whose
(standard) Ô¨Åbre is identiÔ¨Åed with the usual Hilbert space of states F of the quan-
tum system. The system state is described via a lifting of paths Œ® ‚ààPLift(F, œÄ, M)
such that, if Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is a C1 path,
Œ®: Œ≥ ‚ÜíŒ®Œ≥ : t ‚ààJ ‚ÜíŒ®Œ≥(t) = l‚àí1
Œ≥(t)(œà(t)) ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t)),
(16.1)
where l‚àí1
x : F ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(x), x ‚ààM, are Ô¨Åxed isomorphisms and œà(t) ‚ààF is the
conventional state vector of the system at a moment t ‚ààJ.
The time evolution of the system (or of its state lifting Œ®) is governed by the
equation
Œ®Œ∑(t) = UŒ≥(t, s)(Œ®Œ≥(s))
s, t ‚ààJ,
(16.2)
where the evolution transport
U : Œ≥ ‚ÜíUŒ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíUŒ≥(t, s): œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t))
is a (Hermitian and isometric) linear transport along paths in (F, œÄ, M) such that
UŒ≥(t, s) = l‚àí1
Œ≥(t) ‚ó¶U(t, s) ‚ó¶lŒ≥(s) : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t))
(16.3)
with U(t, s) being the system‚Äôs evolution operator in F. It is a remarkable fact
that the matrix Œì(s; Œ≥) of the coeÔ¨Écients of U is
Œì(s; Œ≥) = ‚àí1
i‚ÑèHm
Œ≥ (t)
(16.4)
where i = +‚àö‚àí1 is the imaginary unit, ‚Ñèis the Planck constant (deviled by 2œÄ)
and the matrix-bundle Hamiltonian Hm
Œ≥ (t) is
Hm
Œ≥ (t) = l‚àí1
Œ≥(t)(t)H(t)lŒ≥(t)(t) ‚àíi‚Ñèl‚àí1
Œ≥(t)(t)
dlŒ≥(t)(t)
dt
+ E(t)lŒ≥(t)(t)

.
(16.5)
Here H(t) is the matrix of the system‚Äôs Hamiltonian in a basis {fi(t)} of F, lŒ≥(t)(t)
is the matrix of lŒ≥(t) in this basis and a frame {ei} over M in F, and the matrix
E(t) := [Ej
i (t)] is deÔ¨Åned via the expansion dfi(t)
dt
= Ej
i (t)fj(t).
If D is the derivation along paths generated by U (see DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2 on
page 230), then the state lifting Œ® is a solution of the bundle Schr¬®odinger equation
D(Œ®) = 0
(16.6)
satisfying some initial condition, like Œ®Œ≥(t0) = Œ®0
Œ≥ for Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààJ and Œ®0
Œ≥ ‚àà
œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t0)).
Let A(t): F ‚ÜíF be the linear Hermitian (self-adjoint) operator correspond-
ing to a dynamical variable A in the standard quantum mechanics. In the bundle

330
Chapter IV. Normal Frames in Vector Bundles
approach, to A corresponds a lifting A of paths in the bundle of restricted M-
morphisms of (F, œÄ, M) such that
AŒ≥(t) = l‚àí1
Œ≥(t) ‚ó¶A(t) ‚ó¶lŒ≥(t) : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t)).
(16.7)
The description of a quantum system via liftings like Œ® and A is known as the
bundle Schr¬®odinger picture of motion. The shift to the bundle Heisenberg picture
of motion is via the changes
Œ® ‚ÜíŒ®H : (t, t0; Œ≥) ‚ÜíŒ®H
Œ≥,t(t0)
A ‚ÜíAH : (t, t0; Œ≥) ‚ÜíAH
Œ≥,t(t0),
(16.8)
where t, t0 ‚ààJ and
Œ®H
Œ≥,t(t0) = Œ®Œ≥(t0) = l‚àí1
Œ≥(t0)(œà(t0)) = UŒ≥(t0, t)Œ®Œ≥(t)
(16.9a)
AH
Œ≥,t(t0) = UŒ≥(t, t0)‚àí1 ‚ó¶AŒ≥(t) ‚ó¶UŒ≥(t, t0).
(16.9b)
(The mapping A ‚ÜíAH deÔ¨Ånes a linear transport in the bundle of point restricted
morphisms ‚Äì see [127, p. 4903] and [129, p. 4941].) Thus, in the bundle Heisenberg
picture, the time dependence is entirely transferred to the observables liftings of
paths. The Schr¬®odinger and Heisenberg pictures of motion are completely equiv-
alents from physical point of view as the mean values of the dynamical variables
in them are identical.
Let {ei} be a frame in F (locally) normal along Œ≥ for the evolution transport
U.1 By DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1 this means that the matrix U of U in {ei} is the (corre-
sponding inÔ¨Ånite) identity matrix, U(t, t0) = 1. Consequently equations (16.9)
take the following form in the normal frame {ei}:
Œ®H
Œ≥,t(t0) = Œ®Œ≥(t0) = Œ®Œ≥(t)
(16.10a)
AH
Œ≥,t(t0) = AŒ≥(t).
(16.10b)
In this way we have proved the following result.
Proposition 16.1. The bundle Schr¬®odinger and Heisenberg pictures of motion are
identical in a frame (locally) normal along the reference path Œ≥.

Conclusion
The following three main topics have found their place in this chapter. First,
the grounds of the theory of linear transports along paths in vector bundles are
set and its relations with the one of parallel transports and connections in these
bundles are revealed. Second, the theory of normal frames for such transports was
developed. And third, it was demonstrated that the obtained formalism naturally
1Here we suppose that the condition (5.2) with U for L in Proposition 5.1 is fulÔ¨Ålled.

17. Conclusion
331
agrees with the already existing theory of frames (and coordinates) normal for
(linear) connections and other derivations of the tensor algebra over a diÔ¨Äerentiable
manifold.
It should be noticed, from the view-point of linear transports, a lot of the
earlier-obtained results concerning linear connections (or other derivations) look
considerably simpler and more natural. Here are two typical examples. (i) A linear
transport admits frames normal on some set iÔ¨Äit is Ô¨Çat on it; a linear connection
admits frames normal on a neighborhood iÔ¨Äit is Ô¨Çat on it. (ii) If a linear transport
admits frames normal on some set, such a frame can be obtained via transportation
by means of the transport of a basis over a Ô¨Åxed point in this set to the other
points in it along paths lying entirely in that set; previously this result was known
only on neighborhoods for linear connections and the parallel transports generated
by them: a frame normal on a neighborhood for a Ô¨Çat linear connection can be
obtained by parallelly transporting a basis over a Ô¨Åxed point in this neighborhood
to the other points in it along paths lying in the neighborhoods.
Separately should be mentioned the case of linear transports along paths in
the tangent bundle over a manifold. In it, the Ô¨Çat parallel transports generated by
linear connections are the only ones admitting normal frames. This conclusion is
similar to the one derived in Chapter III concerning frames normal for derivations
along vector Ô¨Åelds and linear connections. Besides, the torsionless Ô¨Çat parallel
transports are the only ones admitting normal coordinates.
At the end, we would like to express the hope that the material in the present
chapter could serve as a groundwork for a systematic exploration of frames (and,
possibly, coordinates) normal for diÔ¨Äerent kinds of derivations or transports along
paths in inÔ¨Ånitely dimensional vector bundles, in particular for linear connections
in inÔ¨Ånitely dimensional manifolds. Partially or mutatis mutandis some of our
results remain valid in the inÔ¨Ånite-dimensional case, but, rigorously speaking, this
case is not studied until now and it is open for further research.

Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
1.
Introduction
All connections considered until now, on manifolds and on vector bundles, were
linear. It is well known that there exist non-linear connections on vector bundles as
well as on non-vector ones. Can normal frames (and/or coordinates) be introduced
for such more general connections? The positive solution of that problem is the
main goal of the present chapter of this book. For the purpose and for a comparison
with the deÔ¨Ånitions and results already obtained is required some preliminary
material on general connection theory on diÔ¨Äerentiable bundles, which is collected
in Sections 2‚Äì5. On its base, the normal frames for connections on such bundles
are studied in Sections 6 and 7.
Sections 2‚Äì5 follow the work [137],1 Sections 6 and 7 are a slightly revised
version of [139], and Section 8 reproduces in a modiÔ¨Åed form the paper [118]
The work is organized as follows.
In Section 2 is collected some introductory material, like the notion of Lie
derivatives and distributions on manifolds, needed for our exposition. Here some
of our notation is Ô¨Åxed too.
Section 3 is devoted to the general connection theory on bundles whose base
and bundles spaces are diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds. From diÔ¨Äerent view-points, this
theory can be found in many works, like [6, 7, 10‚Äì13, 16, 28, 60, 98, 106, 107, 117,
138,140‚Äì146]. In Subsection 3.1 are reviewed some coordinates and frames/bases
on the bundle space which are compatible with the Ô¨Åbre structure of a bundle.
Subsection 3.2 deals with the general connection theory. A connection on a bundle
is deÔ¨Åned as a distribution on its bundle space which is complimentary to the ver-
tical distribution on it. The notions of parallel transport generated by connection
and of specialized frame are introduced. The Ô¨Åbre coeÔ¨Écients and Ô¨Åbre compo-
nents of the curvature of a connection are deÔ¨Åned via part of the components of
the anholonomicity object of a specialized frame. Frames adapted to local bundle
coordinates are introduced and the local (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients in them of a con-
nection are deÔ¨Åned; their transformation law is derived and it is proved that a
geometrical object with such transformation law uniquely deÔ¨Ånes a connection.
In Section 4, the general connection theory from Section 3 is speciÔ¨Åed on
vector bundles. The most important structures in/on them are the ones that are
consistent/compatible with the vector space structure of their Ô¨Åbres. The vertical
lifts of sections of a vector bundle and the horizontal lifts of vector Ô¨Åelds on its
base are investigated in more details in Subsection 4.1. Subsection 4.2 is devoted
to linear connections on vector bundles, i.e., connections such that the assigned to
them parallel transport is a linear mapping. It is proved that the 2-index coeÔ¨É-
cients of a linear connection are linear in the Ô¨Åbre coordinates, which leads to the
introduction of the (3-index) coeÔ¨Écients of the connection; the latter coeÔ¨Écients
1The presentation of the material in Sections 2‚Äì4 is according to some of the main ideas
of [138, Chapters 1 and 2], but their realization here is quite diÔ¨Äerent and follows the modern
trends in diÔ¨Äerential geometry.

1. Introduction

being deÔ¨Åned on the base space. The transformations of diÔ¨Äerent objects under
changes of vector bundle coordinates are explored. The covariant derivatives are
introduced and investigated in Subsection 4.3. They are deÔ¨Åned via the Lie deriva-
tives [138] and a mapping realizing an isomorphism between the vertical vector
Ô¨Åelds on the bundle space and the sections of the bundle. The equivalence of that
deÔ¨Ånition with the widespread one, deÔ¨Åning them as mappings on the module of
sections of the bundle with suitable properties, is proved. In Subsection 4.4, the
aÔ¨Éne connections on vector bundles are considered brieÔ¨Çy.
In Section 5, some of the results of the previous sections are generalized when
frames more general than the ones generated by local coordinates on the bundle
space are employed. The most general such frames, compatible with the Ô¨Åbre
structure, and the frames adapted to them are investigated. The main diÔ¨Äerential-
geometric objects, introduced in the previous sections, are considered in such gen-
eral frames. Particular attention is paid on the case of a vector bundle. In vector
bundles, a bijective correspondence between the mentioned general frames and
pairs of bases, in the vector Ô¨Åelds over the base and in the sections of the bun-
dle, is proved. The (3-index) coeÔ¨Écients of a connection in such pairs of frames
and their transformation laws are considered. The covariant derivatives are also
mentioned on that context.
The theory of normal frames for connections on bundles is considered in
Section 6. Subsection 6.1 deals with the general case. Loosely said, an adapted
frame is called normal if the 2-index coeÔ¨Écients of a connection vanish in it (on
some set). It happens that a frame is normal if and only if it coincides with the
frame it is adapted to. The set of these frames is completely described in the
most general case. The problems of existence, uniqueness, etc. of normal frames
adapted to holonomic frames, i.e., adapted to local coordinates, are discussed in
Subsection 6.2. If such frames exist, their general form is described. The existence
of frames normal at a given point and/or along an injective horizontal path is
proved. The Ô¨Çatness of a connection on an open set is pointed as a necessary
condition of existence of (locally) holonomic frames normal on that set. Some
links between the general theory of normal frames and the one of normal frames
in vector bundles, presented in Chapter IV, are given in Subsection 6.3. It is proved
that a frame is normal on a vector bundle with linear connection if and only if in
it vanish the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of the connection. The equivalence of the both
theories on vector bundles is established.
In Section 7 is formulated and proved a necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition
for existence of coordinates normal along injective mappings with non-vanishing
horizontal component, in particular along injective horizontal mappings.
Section 8 is devoted to some aspects of the axiomatical approach to parallel
transport theory [17,23,30‚Äì33,91,147‚Äì150] and its relations to connection theory;
it is based on the paper [118]. It starts with a deÔ¨Ånition of a transport along
paths in a bundle and a result stating that, under some assumptions, it deÔ¨Ånes
a connection. The most important properties of the parallel transports generated

336
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
by connections are used to be (axiomatically) deÔ¨Åned the concept of a parallel
transport (irrespectively to some connection on a bundle). In a series of results
are constructed bijective mappings between the sets of transports along paths
satisfying some additional conditions, connections, and parallel transports. In this
way, two diÔ¨Äerent, but equivalent, systems of axioms deÔ¨Åning the concept ‚Äúparallel
transport‚Äù will be established.
The chapter ends with some remarks and conclusions in Section 9.

Preliminaries
This section contains an introductory material, notation etc. that will be needed
for our exposition. The reader is referred for details to Chapter I, Section III.2,
and standard books on diÔ¨Äerential geometry, like [7,23,151].
A diÔ¨Äerentiable Ô¨Ånite-dimensional manifold over a Ô¨Åeld K will be denoted
typically by M. Here K stands for the Ô¨Åeld R of real or the Ô¨Åeld C of complex
numbers, K = R, C. The manifolds we consider are supposed to be smooth of
class C2.1 The set of vector Ô¨Åelds, realized as Ô¨Årst-order diÔ¨Äerential operators,
and of diÔ¨Äerential k-forms, k ‚ààN, over M will be denoted by X(M) and Œõk(M),
respectively. The space tangent (resp. cotangent) to M at p ‚ààM is Tp(M) (resp.
T ‚àó
p (M)) and (T (M), œÄT , M) (resp. (T ‚àó(M), œÄT ‚àó, M)) will stand for the tangent
(resp. cotangent) bundle over M. The value of X ‚ààX(M) at p ‚ààM is Xp ‚ààTp(M)
and the action of X on a C1 function œï: M ‚ÜíK is a function X(œï): M ‚ÜíK
such that X(œï)|p := Xp(œï) ‚ààK.
If M and ¬Ø
M are manifolds and f : ¬Ø
M ‚ÜíM is a C1 mapping, then f‚àó:=
df : T ( ¬Ø
M) ‚ÜíT (M) denotes the induced tangent mapping (or diÔ¨Äerential) of f
such that, for p ‚àà¬Ø
M, f‚àó|p := df|p := Tp(f): Tp( ¬Ø
M) ‚ÜíTf(p)(M) and, for a C1
function g on M, (f‚àó(X))(g) := X(g ‚ó¶f): p ‚Üíf‚àó|p(g) = Xp(g ‚ó¶f), with ‚ó¶being
the composition of mappings sign. Respectively, the induced cotangent mapping
is f ‚àó: T ‚àó(M) ‚ÜíT ‚àó( ¬Ø
M). If h: N ‚Üí¬Ø
M, N being a manifold, we have the chain
rule d(f ‚ó¶h) = df ‚ó¶dh, which is an abbreviation for d(f ‚ó¶h)q = (df)f(q) ‚ó¶(dh)q
for q ‚ààN.
By J ‚äÜR will be denoted an arbitrary real interval that can be open or

path in M. For a C1 path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, the vector tangent to Œ≥ at s ‚ààJ will be

1Some of our deÔ¨Ånitions or/and results are valid also for C1 or even C0 manifolds, but
we do not want to overload the material with continuous counting of the required degree of
diÔ¨Äerentiability of the manifolds involved. Some parts of the text admit generalizations on more
general spaces, like the topological ones, but this is out of the subject of the present work.

is closed at s0, the derivative in the deÔ¨Ånition of ÀôŒ≥(s0) is regarded as a one-sided
derivative at s0.
The Lie derivative relative to X ‚ààX(M) will be denoted by LX. It is deÔ¨Åned
on arbitrary geometrical objects on M [89], but below we shall be interested in its
action on tensor Ô¨Åelds [11, Chapter I, ¬ß 2] (see also [152]). If f, Y , and Œ∏ are C1
respectively function, vector Ô¨Åeld and 1-form on M, then
LX(f) = X(f)
(2.1a)
LX(Y ) = [X, Y ]
(2.1b)
(LX(Œ∏))(Y ) = X(Œ∏(Y )) ‚àíŒ∏([X, Y ] ) = (dŒ∏)(X, Y ) + Y (Œ∏(X)),
(2.1c)
where [A, B] = A ‚ó¶B ‚àíB ‚ó¶A is the commutator of operators A and B (with
common domain) and d denotes the exterior derivative operator.
Since LX is a derivation of the tensor algebra over the vector Ô¨Åelds on M,
for a tensor Ô¨Åeld S : Œõ1(M) √ó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ó Œõ1(M) √ó X(M) √ó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ó X(M) ‚ÜíF(M), we
have
(LXS)(Œ∏, . . . ; Y, . . .)
= X(S(Œ∏, . . . ; Y, . . .)) ‚àíS(LXŒ∏, . . . ; Y, . . .) ‚àí¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚àíS(Œ∏, . . . ; LXY, . . .)) ‚àí¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ,
(2.2)
which deÔ¨Ånes LXS explicitly, due to (2.1).
Let the Greek indices Œª, ¬µ, ŒΩ, . . . run over the range 1, . . . , dim M and {E¬µ}
be a C1 frame in T (M), i.e., E¬µ ‚ààX(M) be of class C1 and, for each p ‚ààM, the
set {E¬µ|p} be a basis of the vector space Tp(M).2 Let {E¬µ} be the coframe dual
to {E¬µ}, i.e., E¬µ ‚ààŒõ1(M), {E¬µ|p} be a basis in T ‚àó
p (M), and E¬µ(EŒΩ) = Œ¥¬µ
ŒΩ with
Œ¥ŒΩ
¬µ being the Kronecker deltas (Œ¥ŒΩ
¬µ = 1 for ¬µ = ŒΩ and Œ¥ŒΩ
¬µ = 0 for ¬µ Ã∏= ŒΩ). Assuming
the Einstein‚Äôs summation convention (summation on indices repeated on diÔ¨Äerent
levels over the whole range of their values), we deÔ¨Åne the components (ŒìX)¬µ
ŒΩ of
LX in (relative to) {E¬µ} via the expansion
LXE¬µ =: (ŒìX)ŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ
(2.3)
which is equivalent to
LXE¬µ = ‚àí(ŒìX)¬µ
ŒΩEŒΩ
(2.3‚Ä≤)
by virtue of E¬µ(EŒΩ) = Œ¥¬µ
ŒΩ and the commutativity of the Lie derivatives and con-
traction operators.3 From (2.3) and (2.1b), we get
(ŒìX)ŒΩ
¬µ = ‚àíE¬µ(XŒΩ) ‚àíCŒΩ
¬µŒªXŒª,
(2.4)
2There are manifolds, like the even-dimensional spheres S2k, k ‚ààN, which do not admit
global, continuous (and moreover Ck for k ‚â•1), and nowhere vanishing vector Ô¨Åelds [153]. If
this is the case, the considerations must be localized over an open subset of M on which such
Ô¨Åelds exist. We shall not overload our exposition with such details.
3The sign before (ŒìX)¬µ
ŒΩ in (2.3) or (2.3‚Ä≤) is conventional and we have chosen it in a way
similar to the accepted convention for the components of a covariant derivative (or, equivalently,
the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection ‚Äì see Section 4).

is given by (III.2.1).
A frame {E¬µ} or its dual coframe {E¬µ} is called holonomic (anholonomic)
if CŒª
¬µŒΩ = 0 (CŒª
¬µŒΩ Ã∏= 0) for all (some) values of the indices ¬µ, ŒΩ, and Œª. For a
holonomic frame there always exist local coordinates {x¬µ} on M such that locally
E¬µ =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ and E¬µ = dx¬µ. Conversely, if {x¬µ} are local coordinates on M, then
the local frame

‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ

and local coframe {dx¬µ} are well deÔ¨Åned and holonomic on
the domain of {x¬µ}. For more information concerning (an)holonomic frames, see
Section I.8.
A straightforward calculation by means of (2.5) reveals that a change
{E¬µ} ‚Üí{ ¬ØE¬µ = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ}
(2.6)
of the frame {E¬µ}, where B = [BŒΩ
¬µ] is a non-degenerate matrix-valued function,

suÔ¨Écient condition for the integrability of ‚àÜis the commutator of every two vector
Ô¨Åelds in ‚àÜto be in ‚àÜ. We say that a vector Ô¨Åeld X ‚ààX(M) is in ‚àÜand write
X ‚àà‚àÜ, if Xp ‚àà‚àÜp for all p ‚ààM. A basis on U ‚äÜM for ‚àÜis a set {X1, . . . , Xn}
of n linearly independent (relative to functions U ‚ÜíK) vector Ô¨Åelds in ‚àÜ|U, i.e.,
{X1|p, . . . , Xn|p} is a basis for ‚àÜp for all p ‚ààU.
A distribution is convenient to be described in terms of (global) frames or/and
coframes over M. In fact, if p ‚ààM and œ± = 1, . . . , n, in each ‚àÜp ‚äÜTp(M), we
can choose a basis {Xœ±|p} and hence a frame {Xœ±}, Xœ± : p ‚ÜíXœ±|p, in {‚àÜp : p ‚àà
M} ‚äÜT (M); we say that {XœÅ} is a basis for/in ‚àÜ. Conversely, any collection
of n linearly independent (relative to functions M ‚ÜíK) vector Ô¨Åelds Xœ± on M
deÔ¨Ånes a distribution p ‚Üí

n
œ±=1 f œ±Xœ±|p : f œ± ‚ààK

. Consequently, a frame in
T (M) can be formed by adding to a basis for ‚àÜa set of (dim M ‚àín) new linearly
independent vector Ô¨Åelds (forming a frame in T (M) \ {‚àÜp : p ‚ààM}) and v.v., by
selecting n linearly independent vector Ô¨Åelds on M, we can deÔ¨Åne a distribution
‚àÜon M. Equivalently, one can use dim M ‚àín linearly independent 1-forms œâa,
a = n + 1, . . . , dim M, which are annihilators for it, œâa|‚àÜp = 0 for all p ‚ààM. For
instance, if {X¬µ : ¬µ = 1, . . . , dim M} is a frame in T (M) and {Xœ± : œ± = 1, . . . , n}
is a basis for ‚àÜ, then one can deÔ¨Åne œâa to be elements in the coframe {œâ¬µ} dual
to {X¬µ}. We call {œâa} a cobasis for ‚àÜ.

Connections on bundles
Before presenting the general connection theory in Subsection 3.2, we shall Ô¨Åx
Ô¨Årst some notation and concepts concerning Ô¨Åbre bundles in Subsection 3.1.The
reader is referred for more details to Subsection IV.2.1 and to the literature cited
in Section IV.1.
3.1.
Frames and coframes on the bundle space
Let (E, œÄ, M) be a bundle with bundle space E, projection œÄ: E ‚ÜíM, and base
space M. Suppose that the spaces M and E are manifolds of Ô¨Ånite dimensions
n ‚ààN and n+r, for some r ‚ààN, respectively; so the dimension of the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(x),
with x ‚ààM, i.e., the Ô¨Åbre dimension of (E, œÄ, M), is r. Besides, let these manifolds
be C2 diÔ¨Äerentiable, if the opposite is not stated explicitly.1
Let the Greek indices Œª, ¬µ, ŒΩ, . . . run from 1 to n = dim M, the Latin indices
a, b, c, . . . take the values from n + 1 to n + r = dim E, and the uppercase Latin
1Most of our considerations are valid also if C1 diÔ¨Äerentiability is assumed and even some
of them hold on C0 manifolds. By assuming C2 diÔ¨Äerentiability, we skip the problem of count-
ing the required diÔ¨Äerentiability class of the whole material that follows. Sometimes, the C2
diÔ¨Äerentiability is required explicitly, which is a hint that a statement or deÔ¨Ånition is not valid
otherwise. If we want to emphasize that some text is valid under a C1 diÔ¨Äerentiability assump-
tion, we indicate that fact explicitly. However, the proofs of Proposition 6.5 and all assertions in
Section 7 require C3 diÔ¨Äerentiability, which will be indicated explicitly.

340
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
indices I, J, K, . . . take values in the whole set {1, . . . , n + r}. One may call these
types of indices respectively base, Ô¨Åbre, and bundle indices.
Suppose {uI} = {u¬µ, ua} = {u1, . . . , un+r} are local bundle coordinates on
an open set W ‚äÜE, i.e., on the set œÄ(W) ‚äÜM there are local coordinates {x¬µ}
such that u¬µ = x¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ;2 the coordinates {u¬µ} (resp. {ua}) are called basic (resp.
Ô¨Åbre) coordinates [23].3
Further only coordinate changes
{u¬µ, ua} ‚Üí{Àúu¬µ, Àúua}
(3.1a)
on E between bundle coordinates will be considered. This means that
Àúu¬µ(p) = f ¬µ(u1(p), . . . , un(p))
Àúua(p) = f a(u1(p), . . . , un(p), un+1(p), . . . , un+r(p))
(3.1b)
for p ‚ààU ‚à©ÀúU, with U being the domain of the coordinates {ÀúuI} and some
functions f I. The bundle coordinates {u¬µ, ua} induce the (local) frame

‚àÇ¬µ :=

‚àÇu¬µ , ‚àÇa :=

‚àÇua

and coframe {du¬µ, dua} over W in respectively the tangent
T (E) and cotangent T ‚àó(E) bundle spaces of the tangent and cotangent bundles
over the bundle space E. Since a change (3.1) of the coordinates on E implies
‚àÇI ‚ÜíÀú‚àÇI :=
‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI = ‚àÇuJ
‚àÇÀúuI ‚àÇJ and duI ‚ÜídÀúuI =
‚àÇÀúuI
‚àÇuJ duJ, the transformation (3.1)
leads to
(‚àÇ¬µ, ‚àÇa) ‚Üí(Àú‚àÇ¬µ, Àú‚àÇa) = (‚àÇŒΩ, ‚àÇb) ¬∑ A

where 0n√ór is the n √ó r zero matrix. Besides, in expressions of the form ‚àÇIaI, like
the one in the right-hand side of (3.2a), the summation excludes diÔ¨Äerentiation,
i.e., ‚àÇIaI := aI‚àÇI = 
I aI‚àÇI; if a diÔ¨Äerentiation really takes place, we write
‚àÇI(aI) := 
I ‚àÇI(aI). This rule allows a lot of formulae to be written in a compact
matrix form, like (3.2a). The explicit form of the matrix inverse to (3.3) is A‚àí1 =

2On a bundle or Ô¨Åbred manifold, these coordinates are known also as adapted coordinates [116,

3If (W, v) is a bundle chart, with v: W
‚ÜíKn √ó Kr and ea : Kr ‚ÜíK are such that
ea(c1, . . . , cr) = ca ‚ààK, then one can put ua = ea ‚ó¶pr2 ‚ó¶v, where pr2 : Kn √ó Kr ‚ÜíKr is
the projection on the second multiplier Kr.

Connection theory
From a number of equivalent deÔ¨Ånitions of a connection on diÔ¨Äerentiable mani-
fold [146, Sections 2.1 and 2.2], we shall use the following one.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1 (cf. DeÔ¨Ånition IV.14.3 on page 303). A connection on diÔ¨Äerentiable
bundle (E, œÄ, M) is an n = dim M-dimensional distribution ‚àÜh on E such that,
for each p ‚ààE and the vertical distribution ‚àÜv deÔ¨Åned by
‚àÜv : p ‚Üí‚àÜv
p := Tƒ±(p)

œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p))
 ‚àº= Tp

œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p))

,
(3.11)
with ƒ±: œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p)) ‚ÜíE being the inclusion mapping, is fulÔ¨Ålled
‚àÜv
p ‚äï‚àÜh
p = Tp(E),
(3.12)
where ‚àÜh : p ‚Üí‚àÜh
p ‚äÜTp(E) and ‚äïis the direct sum sign. The distribution ‚àÜh is
called horizontal and symbolically we write ‚àÜv ‚äï‚àÜh = T (E).
A vector at a point p ‚ààE (resp. a vector Ô¨Åeld on E) is said to be vertical
or horizontal if it (resp. its value at p) belongs to ‚àÜv
p or ‚àÜh
p, respectively, for the
given (resp. any) point p. A vector Yp ‚ààTp(E) (resp. vector Ô¨Åeld Y ‚ààX(E))
is called a horizontal lift of a vector XœÄ(p) ‚ààTœÄ(p)(M) (resp. vector Ô¨Åeld X ‚àà
X(M) on M = œÄ(E)) if œÄ‚àó(Yp) = XœÄ(p) for the given (resp. any) point p ‚ààE.
Since œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh
p : ‚àÜh
p ‚ÜíTœÄ(p)(M) is a vector space isomorphism for all p ‚ààE [23,
Section 1.24], any vector in TœÄ(p)(M) (resp. vector Ô¨Åeld in X(M)) has a unique
horizontal lift in Tp(E) (resp. X(E)).
As a result of (3.12), any vector Yp ‚ààTp(E) (resp. vector Ô¨Åeld Y ‚ààX(E))
admits a unique representation Yp = Y v
p ‚äïY h
p (resp. Y = Y v ‚äïY h) with Y v
p ‚àà‚àÜv
p
and Y h
p
‚àà‚àÜh
p (resp. Y v ‚àà‚àÜv and Y h ‚àà‚àÜh). If the distribution p ‚Üí‚àÜh
p is
diÔ¨Äerentiable of class Cm, m ‚ààN ‚à™{0, ‚àû, œâ}, it is said that the connection ‚àÜh
is (diÔ¨Äerentiable) of class Cm. A connection ‚àÜh is of class Cm if and only if, for

3. Connections on bundles
343
every Cm vector Ô¨Åeld Y on E, the vertical Y v and horizontal Y h vector Ô¨Åelds are
of class Cm.
A C1 path Œ≤ : J ‚ÜíE is called horizontal (vertical) if its tangent vector ÀôŒ≤ is
horizontal (vertical) vector along Œ≤, i.e., ÀôŒ≤(s) ‚àà‚àÜh
Œ≤(s) ( ÀôŒ≤(s) ‚àà‚àÜv
Œ≤(s)) for all s ‚ààJ.
A lifting ¬ØŒ≥ : J ‚ÜíE of a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, i.e., œÄ ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥ = Œ≥, is called horizontal if
¬ØŒ≥ is a horizontal path, i.e., when the vector Ô¨Åeld Àô¬ØŒ≥ tangent to ¬ØŒ≥ is horizontal or,
equivalently, if Àô¬ØŒ≥ is a horizontal lift of ÀôŒ≥. Since œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(J)) is an (r +1)-dimensional
submanifold of E, the distribution p ‚Üí‚àÜh
p ‚à©Tp(œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(J))) is one-dimensional
and, consequently, is integrable for arbitrary C1 path Œ≥. The integral paths of
that distribution are horizontal lifts of Œ≥ and, for each p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(J)), there is
(locally) a unique horizontal lift ¬ØŒ≥p of Œ≥ passing through p.4
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2. Let Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM, with œÉ, œÑ ‚ààR and œÉ ‚â§œÑ, and ¬ØŒ≥p be the unique
horizontal lift of Œ≥ in E passing through p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥([œÉ, œÑ])). The parallel transport
(translation, displacement) generated by (assigned to, deÔ¨Åned by) a connection
‚àÜh is a mapping P: Œ≥ ‚ÜíPŒ≥, assigning to the path Œ≥ a mapping
PŒ≥ : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÑ))
Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM
(3.13)
such that, for each p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)),
PŒ≥(p) := ¬ØŒ≥p(œÑ).
(3.14)
In vector bundles are important the linear connections for which is required
the parallel transport assigned to them to be linear in a sense that the map-
ping (3.13) is linear for every path Œ≥ (see Subsection 4.2 below).
Let us now look on the connections ‚àÜh on a bundle (E, œÄ, M) from a view
point of (local) frames and their dual coframes on E. Let {e¬µ} be a basis for ‚àÜh,
i.e., e¬µ ‚àà‚àÜh and {e¬µ|p} is a basis for ‚àÜh
p for all p ‚ààE, and {ea} be the coframe
for ‚àÜh, i.e., a collection of 1-forms ea, a = n + 1, . . . , n + r, which are linearly
independent (relative to functions E ‚ÜíK) and such that ea(X) = 0 if X ‚àà‚àÜh.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.3. A frame {eI} in T (E) over E is called specialized for a connection
‚àÜh if the Ô¨Årst n = dim M of its vector Ô¨Åelds form a basis {e¬µ} for the horizontal
distribution ‚àÜh and its last r = dim œÄ‚àí1(x), x ‚ààM, vector Ô¨Åelds form a basis
{ea} for the vertical distribution ‚àÜv. Respectively, a coframe {eI} on E is called
specialized if {ea} is a cobasis for ‚àÜh and {e¬µ} is a cobasis for ‚àÜv.
The horizontal lifts of vector Ô¨Åelds and 1-forms can easily be described in
specialized (co)frames. Indeed, let {eI} and {eI} be respectively a specialized frame
and its dual coframe. DeÔ¨Åne a frame {E¬µ} and its dual coframe {E¬µ} on M which
are œÄ-related to {eI} and {eI}, i.e., E¬µ := œÄ‚àó(e¬µ) and e¬µ := œÄ‚àó(E¬µ) = E¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ‚àó.5
4In this sense, a connection ‚àÜh is an Ehresmann connection [16, p. 314] and vice versa [116,
pp. 85‚Äì89].
5Recall, œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh
p : ‚àÜh
p ‚ÜíTœÄ(p)(M) is a vector space isomorphism.

Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
If Y = Y ¬µE¬µ ‚ààX(M) and œÜ = œÜ¬µe¬µ ‚ààŒõ1(M), then their horizontal lifts (from
M to E) respectively are
¬ØY = (Y ¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)e¬µ
¬ØœÜ = (œÜ¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)e¬µ.
(3.15)
The specialized (co)frames transform into each other according to the general
rules (3.4) in which the transformation matrix and its inverse have the following
block structure:

(3.16)
where AŒΩ
¬µ, Ab
a : E ‚ÜíK and the functions AŒΩ
¬µ are constant on the Ô¨Åbres of the
bundle (E, œÄ, M), that is, we have
AŒΩ
¬µ = BŒΩ
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ
or
‚àÇAŒΩ
¬µ
‚àÇua = 0
(3.17)
for some nondegenerate matrix-valued function [BŒΩ
¬µ] on M. Besides, in a case
of vector bundle, the functions Aa
b are also constant on the Ô¨Åbres of the bundle
(E, œÄ, M), i.e.,
Ab
a = Bb
a ‚ó¶œÄ
or
‚àÇAb
a
‚àÇua = 0
(3.18)
for some nondegenerate matrix-valued function B = [Bb
a] on M. Changes like (3.4),
with A given by (3.16), respect the Ô¨Åbre as well as the connection structure of the
bundle.
Let E be a C2 manifold and ‚àÜh a C1 connection on (E, œÄ, M). The com-
ponents CK
IJ of the anholonomicity object of a specialized frame {eI} are (local)
functions on E deÔ¨Åned by (see (2.5))
[eI, eJ] =: CK

{CŒª

{Ca
¬µŒΩ},
{CŒª
¬µb = 0},
{CŒª
ab = 0},
{Cc
¬µb},
{Cc

(3.20)
The functions CŒª
¬µŒΩ are constant on the Ô¨Åbres of (E, œÄ, M), precisely CŒª
¬µŒΩ = f Œª
¬µŒΩ ‚ó¶œÄ
where f Œª
¬µŒΩ are the components of the anholonomicity object for the œÄ-related frame
{œÄ‚àó(e¬µ)} on M, as the commutators of œÄ-related vector Ô¨Åelds are œÄ-related [7,
Section 1.55]. Besides, since the vertical distribution ‚àÜv is integrable (the space
‚àÜv
p is the space tangent to the Ô¨Åbre through p ‚ààE at p), we have
[ea, eb] = Cc
abec
(3.21)
(so that CŒª
ab = 0), due to which Cc
ab are called components of the vertical anholo-
nomicity object. To prove that CŒª
¬µb = 0, one should expand {eI} along

object of ‚àÜh) and Ô¨Åbre components of the curvature of ‚àÜh (or components of the
curvature (object) of ‚àÜh) in {eI}. Under a change (3.4), with a matrix (3.16), of
the specialized frame, the functions (3.22) transform into respectively

Up to a meaning of the matrices [AŒΩ
¬µ] and ¬ØA and the size of the matrices ‚ó¶ŒìŒΩ and
¬ØA, the last equation is identical with the one expressing the transformed matrices
of the coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection (covariant derivative operator) in a vector
bundle (see (IV.14.25) for N = M and g = idM or [87, eq. (3.5)]) on which we
shall return later in this chapter (see Section 4, in particular equation (4.23‚Ä≤) in
it). Equation (3.24b) indicates that Ra

called curvature tensor of the connection ‚àÜh. By (3.23a), the horizontal distribu-
tion ‚àÜh is (locally) integrable iÔ¨Äits curvature tensor vanishes, ‚Ñ¶= 0.
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.4. A connection with vanishing curvature tensor is called Ô¨Çat, or
integrable, or curvature free.

Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
Proposition 3.1. The Ô¨Çat connections are the only ones that may admit holonomic
specialized frames.
Proof. See DeÔ¨Ånition 3.4 and (3.23b).
‚ñ°
The above considerations of specialized (co)frames for a connection ‚àÜh on a
bundle (E, œÄ, M) were global as we supposed that these (co)frames are deÔ¨Åned on
the whole bundle space E, which is always possible if no smoothness conditions
on ‚àÜh are imposed. Below we shall show how local specialized (co)frames can be
deÔ¨Åned via local bundle coordinates on E.
Let {uI} be local bundle coordinates on an open set W ‚äÜE. They deÔ¨Åne on
T (W) ‚äÜT (E) the local basis

‚àÇI :=

, so that any vector can be expended
along its vectors. In particular, we can do so with any basic vector Ô¨Åeld eW
I
of a
specialized frame {eI} restricted to W, eW
I
:= eI|W . Since {‚àÇa|p}, with p ‚ààW, is
a basis for ‚àÜv
p, we can write
(eW

a ) = (AŒΩ

where [AŒΩ

DeÔ¨Ånition 3.5. A frame {XI} over W in T (W) is called adapted (to the coordinates
{uI} in W) for a connection ‚àÜh if it is the specialized frame obtained from (3.27)
via admissible transformation (3.4) with the matrix A =

Exercise 3.1. An arbitrary specialized frame {eW

deÔ¨Ånition of a frame {XI} adapted to bundle coordinates {uI} on W. Prove that
{XI} is independent of the particular choice of the frame {eW
I }. (Hint: apply
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.5 and (3.4a) with A given by (3.16).) The below-derived equality (3.34)
is an indirect proof of that fact too.
According to (3.4) and DeÔ¨Ånition 3.5, the adapted frame {XI} and the cor-
responding to it adapted coframe {œâI} are given by
X¬µ = ‚àÇ¬µ + Œìa

and are called (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh. In a matrix form, the equations (3.28)

3. Connections on bundles
347
The operators X¬µ = ‚àÇ¬µ + Œìa
¬µ‚àÇa are known as covariant derivatives on T (W)
and the plus sing in (3.28a) before Œìa
¬µ (hence in the right-hand side of (3.29)) is
conventional.
If {uI} and {ÀúuI} are local coordinates on open sets W ‚äÜE and ÀúW ‚äÜE,
respectively, and W ‚à©Àú
W Ã∏= ‚àÖ, then, on the overlapping set W ‚à©ÀúW, a problem
arises: how are connected the adapted frames corresponding to these coordinates?
Let us mark with a tilde all quantities that refer to the coordinates {ÀúuI}. Since
the adapted frames are, by deÔ¨Ånitions, specialized ones, we can write (see (3.4))
( ÀúX¬µ, ÀúXa) = (XŒΩ, Xb) ¬∑ A

ing (3.2) and (3.3), from these equalities, we get

(3.31b)
Combining (3.29) and (3.31), one can easily prove
Proposition 3.2. A change {uI} ‚Üí{ÀúuI} of the local bundle coordinates implies the
following transformation of the 2-index coeÔ¨Écients of the connection:
Œìa

¬µ =

‚àÇub Œìb
ŒΩ + ‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇuŒΩ

‚àÇÀúu¬µ .
(3.32)
It is obvious, a connection ‚àÜh is of class Cm, m ‚ààN ‚à™{0}, if and only if its
coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
¬µ are Cm functions on W, provided ‚àÇI are Cm vector Ô¨Åelds on W
(which is the case when E is a Cm+1 manifold). By virtue of (3.32), the Cm+1
changes of the local bundle coordinates preserve the Cm diÔ¨Äerentiability of Œìa
¬µ.
Thus the Cm+1 diÔ¨Äerentiability of the base M and bundle E spaces is a necessary
condition for existence of Cm connections on (E, œÄ, M); as we assumed m = 1 in
this chapter, the connections considered here can be at most of diÔ¨Äerentiability
class C1.
The next proposition states that a connection on a bundle is locally equivalent
to a geometric object whose components transform like (3.32).
Proposition 3.3. To any connection ‚àÜh in a bundle (E, œÄ, M) can be assigned,
according to the procedure described above, a geometrical object on E whose com-
ponents Œìa
¬µ in bundle coordinates {uI} on E transform according to (3.32) under a
change {uI} ‚Üí{ÀúuI} of the bundle coordinates on the intersection of the domains
of {uI} and {ÀúuI}. Conversely, given a geometrical object on E with local transfor-
mation law (3.32), there is a unique connection ‚àÜh in (E, œÄ, M) which generates
the components of that object as described above.

348
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
Proof. The Ô¨Årst part of the statement was proved above, when we constructed
the adapted frame (3.28a) and derived (3.32). To prove the second part, choose a
point p ‚ààE and some local coordinates {uI} on an open set W in E containing
p in which the geometrical object mentioned has local components Œìa
¬µ. DeÔ¨Åne a
local frame {XI} = {X¬µ, Xa} on W by (3.28a). The required connection is then
‚àÜh : q ‚Üí‚àÜh
q := {r¬µX¬µ|q : r¬µ ‚ààK} for any q ‚ààW, which means that ‚àÜh
q is the
linear cover of {X¬µ|q}. The transformation law (3.32) insures the independence of
‚àÜh from the local coordinates employed in its deÔ¨Ånition.
‚ñ°
From the construction of an adapted frame {XI}, as well as from the proof
of Proposition 3.3, follows that the set of vectors {X¬µ} is a basis for the horizontal
distribution ‚àÜh and the set {Xa} is a basis for the vertical distribution ‚àÜv. The
matrix of the restricted tangent projection œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh in bundle coordinate system
{u¬µ = x¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ, ua} on E, where x¬µ are local coordinates on M, is the identity
matrix as (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh
p)ŒΩ
¬µ = ‚àÇ(x¬µ‚ó¶œÄ)
‚àÇu¬µ
			
p = Œ¥ŒΩ
¬µ for any point p in the domain of {uI}. Hereof
we get

p(X¬µ|p) =

(3.33)
In particular, from here follows that œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh
p : ‚àÜh
p ‚ÜíTœÄ(p)(M) is a vector space
isomorphism. The inverse to equation (3.33), viz.
X¬µ = (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1 ‚àÇ


= (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1 ‚ó¶œÄ‚àó
 ‚àÇ
‚àÇu¬µ

,
(3.34)
can be used in an equivalent deÔ¨Ånition of a frame {XI} adapted to local coordinates
{uI}, namely, this is the frame


‚àÇ
‚àÇu¬µ

,
‚àÇ
‚àÇua

. If one accepts such
a deÔ¨Ånition of an adapted frame for ‚àÜh, the (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh have to
be deÔ¨Åned via the expansion (3.28a); the only changes this may entail are in the
proofs of some results, like (3.31) and (3.32).
It is useful to be recorded also the simple fact that, by construction, we have
œÄ‚àó(Xa) = 0.
(3.35)
Let E be a C2 manifold and ‚àÜh be a C1 connection. The adapted frames are
generally anholonomic as the commutators between the basic vector Ô¨Åelds of the
adapted frame (3.28a) are (cf. (3.20) and (3.22))
[X¬µ, XŒΩ] = Ra
¬µŒΩXa
[X¬µ, Xb] = ‚ó¶Œìa

3. Connections on bundles
349
An obvious corollary from (3.36) is
Proposition 3.4. An adapted frame is holonomic if and only if
Ra
¬µŒΩ = 0
( ‚áê‚áí
‚Ñ¶= 0)
‚ó¶Œìa
b¬µ = 0.
(3.38)
Therefore only the Ô¨Çat (integrable) C1 connections, for which ‚Ñ¶= 0, may
admit holonomic adapted frames (cf. Proposition 3.1). Besides, as a consequence
of (3.37b) and (3.38), such connections admit holonomic adapted frames on W ‚äÜE
if and only if there are local coordinates on W in which the coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
¬µ are
constant on the Ô¨Åbres passing through W, i.e., iÔ¨ÄŒìa
¬µ = Ga
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ for some functions
Ga
¬µ : œÄ(W) ‚ÜíK, which is equivalent to ‚àÇb(Œìa
¬µ) = 0.
Example 3.1 (horizontal lifting of a path). Recall, the horizontal lift of a C1 path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM passing through a point p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t0)) for some t0 ‚ààJ is the unique
path ¬ØŒ≥p : J ‚ÜíE such that œÄ ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥p = Œ≥, ¬ØŒ≥p(t0) = p, and Àô¬ØŒ≥p(t) ‚àà‚àÜh
¬ØŒ≥p(t) for all t ‚ààJ.
As in a specialized frame {eI} the relation Xp ‚àà‚àÜh
p is equivalent to ea(X) = 0
for any X ‚ààX(M), in an adapted coframe, given by (3.28b), the horizontal lift
¬ØŒ≥p of Œ≥ is the unique solution of the initial value problem
œâa(Àô¬ØŒ≥p) = 0

dt
,
entering into (3.39‚Ä≤‚Ä≤a), are the components of the vector ÀôŒ≥ tangent to Œ≥ at param-
eter value t.) One may call (3.39a), or any one of its versions (3.39‚Ä≤a) or (3.39‚Ä≤‚Ä≤a),
the parallel transport equation in an adapted frame as it uniquely determines the
parallel transport along the restriction of Œ≥ to any closed subinterval in J (see
DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2).
Example 3.2 (the equation of geodesic paths). A connection ‚àÜh on the tangent
bundle (T (M), œÄT , M) of a manifold M is called a connection on M. In this
case, equation (3.39) deÔ¨Ånes also the geodesics (relative to ‚àÜh) in M. A C2 path
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM in a C2 manifold M is called a geodesic path if its tangent vector Ô¨Åeld
ÀôŒ≥ undergoes parallel transport along the same path Œ≥, i.e., PŒ≥|[œÉ,œÑ](ÀôŒ≥(œÉ)) = ÀôŒ≥(œÑ)

for all œÉ, œÑ ‚ààJ, which means that the lifted path ÀôŒ≥ : J ‚ÜíT (M) is a horizontal lift
of Œ≥ (relative to ‚àÜh). So, if x¬µ are local coordinates on œÄ(W) ‚ààM and the bundle
coordinates on W ‚äÜE are such that [7, Section 1.25] u¬µ = x¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ and un+¬µ = dx¬µ

iÔ¨Åed by Ô¨Åxing some initial values for Œ≥(t0) and ÀôŒ≥(t0) for some to ‚ààJ. Notice,
equation (3.40) is an equation for a path Œ≥ in M, while (3.39‚Ä≤‚Ä≤a) is an equation
for the lifted path ¬ØŒ≥ in T (M) provided the path Œ≥ in M is known; for a geodesic
path, evidently, we have ¬ØŒ≥ = ÀôŒ≥. With obvious renumbering of the indices, one
usually writes Œì¬µ
ŒΩ for Œìn+¬µ

Connections on vector bundles
In this section, by (E, œÄ, M) we shall denote an arbitrary vector bundle (see Sec-
tion IV.2 or, e.g., [23]). A peculiarity of such bundles is that their Ô¨Åbres are isomor-
phic vector spaces, which leads to a natural description of the vertical distribution
‚àÜv on their Ô¨Åbre spaces, as well as to existence of a kind of diÔ¨Äerentiation of their
sections (known as covariant diÔ¨Äerentiation ‚Äì see Subsection IV.14.1).
In the vector bundles are used, as we shall do in this section, the so-called
vector bundle coordinates whose Ô¨Åbre coordinates are linear on their Ô¨Åbres and
are constructed as follows (cf. [116, p. 30].
Let {ea} be a frame in E over a subset WM ‚äÜM, i.e., {ea(x)} to be a basis in
œÄ‚àí1(x) for all x ‚ààWM. Then, for each p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(WM), we have a unique expansion
p = paea(œÄ(p)) for some numbers pa ‚ààK. The vector Ô¨Åbre coordinates {ua} on
œÄ‚àí1(WM) induced (generated) by the frame {ea} are deÔ¨Åned via ua(p) := pa and
hence can be identiÔ¨Åed with the elements of the coframe {ea} dual to {ea}, i.e.,
ua = ea. Conversely, if {uI} are coordinates on œÄ‚àí1(WM) for some WM ‚äÜM which
are linear on the Ô¨Åbres over WM, then there is a unique frame {ea} in œÄ‚àí1(WM)
which generates {ua} as just described; indeed, considering un+1, . . . , un+r as 1-
forms on œÄ‚àí1(WM), one should deÔ¨Åne the frame {ea} required as a one whose dual
is {ua}, i.e., via the conditions ua(eb) = Œ¥a
b .
A collection {uI} of basic coordinates u¬µ and vector Ô¨Åbre coordinates ua
on œÄ‚àí1(WM) is called vector bundle coordinate system on œÄ‚àí1(WM). Only such
coordinates on E will be employed in this section.
4.1.
Vertical lifts
The idea of describing the vertical distribution ‚àÜv on a vector bundle is that, if
L is a vector space, then to any Y ‚ààL there corresponds a ‚Äòvertical‚Äô vector Ô¨Åeld

4. Connections on vector bundles
351
Y v ‚ààX(L) = Sec(T (L), œÄT , L) whose value at X ‚ààL is the vector tangent to the
path t ‚ÜíX + tY ‚ààL, with t ‚ààR, at t = 0, i.e., Y v|X :=
d
dt
		
t=0(X + tY ). Here,
as usual, with Sec(E, œÄ, M) (resp. Secm(E, œÄ, M) with m ‚ààN ‚à™{0}) we denote
the module of sections (resp. Cm sections) of a bundle (E, œÄ, M) (resp. of a Cm+1
bundle (E, œÄ, M)).
Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle and ‚àÜv the vertical distribution on it, viz.,
for each p ‚ààE, ‚àÜv : p ‚Üí‚àÜv
p := Tp(œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p))). To every Y ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M), we
assign a vertical vector Ô¨Åeld Y v ‚àà‚àÜv on E such that, for p ‚ààE,
Y v
p := Y v|p := d
dt
			
t=0(p + tY |œÄ(p)).
(4.1)
(The mapping (p, YœÄ(p)) ‚ÜíY v
p deÔ¨Ånes an isomorphism from the pullback bundle
œÄ‚àóE into the vertical bundle V(E) ‚Äì see [23, Sections 1.27 and 1.28] and also [116,
p. 41, Exercises 2.2.1 and 2.2.2].)
Lemma 4.1. Let {ua} be vector Ô¨Åbre coordinates generated by a frame {ea} on M.
If Y ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) and Y = Y aea, then
Y v = (Y a ‚ó¶œÄ) ‚àÇ
‚àÇua .
(4.2)
Proof. Using the DeÔ¨Ånition (4.1), we get for p ‚ààE:
Y v|p = d
dt
			
t=0(p + tY |œÄ(p)) = d(ua(p + tY |œÄ(p)))
dt
			
t=0
‚àÇ
‚àÇua
			
p
= d(pa + tY a(œÄ(p)))

t=0

p =

p,
where equation (I.2.7) was applied.
‚ñ°
If Y ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M), the vector Ô¨Åeld Y v := v(Y ) ‚àà‚àÜv, deÔ¨Åned via (4.1),
is called the vertical lift of the section
Y . It is (locally) given by (4.2) in vector
bundle coordinates.
Proposition 4.1. The mapping
v: Sec(E, œÄ, M) ‚Üí{vector Ô¨Åelds in ‚àÜv}
v: Y ‚ÜíY v : p ‚ÜíY v|p := d
dt
			
t=0(p + tYœÄ(p))
(4.3)
is a bijection and it and its inverse are linear mappings.
Proof. The linearity and injectivity of v follow directly from (4.1). Now we shall
prove that, for each Z ‚àà‚àÜv, there is a Y ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) such that Y v = Z, i.e., v is
also surjective. Let Z = Za
‚àÇ
‚àÇua , with {uI} being (local) vector bundle coordinates
on E and the functions Za being constant on the Ô¨Åbres of E, that is ZI = zI ‚ó¶œÄ

352
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
for some functions zI on M. DeÔ¨Åne Y = zaea with {ea} being the frame in E over
M generating {ua}. By Lemma 4.1, we have Y v = (za ‚ó¶œÄ)
‚àÇ
‚àÇua = Za
‚àÇ
‚àÇua = Z. The
linearity of v‚àí1 follows from here too.
‚ñ°
Consider a section œâ of the bundle dual to (E, œÄ, M) [23]. Its vertical lift œâv
is a 1-form on ‚àÜv such that, for Z ‚àà‚àÜv and p ‚ààE, œâv(Z)|p = œâ(Y )|œÄ(p) for the
unique section Y ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) with Y v = Z (see Proposition 4.1), i.e., we have
œâv(¬∑)|p = (œâ ‚ó¶v‚àí1(¬∑))|œÄ(p) which means that
œâv(Z) = (œâ ‚ó¶v‚àí1(Z)) ‚ó¶œÄ
or
œâv(Y v)|p = œâ(Y )|œÄ(p)
(= œâœÄ(p)(YœÄ(p))).
(4.4)
If {ea = ua} is the coframe dual to {ea}, and œâ = œâaea, then in the coframe
{dua} dual to

‚àÇ
‚àÇua

, we can write (cf. (4.2))
œâv = (œâa ‚ó¶œÄ)dua.
(4.5)
It should be mentioned, ‚Äòvertical‚Äô lifts of vector Ô¨Åelds or 1-forms over the base
space M are generally not deÔ¨Åned unless E = T (M) or E = T ‚àó(M), respectively.1
A section Y of (E, œÄ, M) and section œâ of the bundle dual to (E, œÄ, M) can
be lifted vertically via the mappings
v: Y ‚ÜíY v ‚àà‚àÜv
(4.6a)
œâ ‚Üíœâv
(4.6b)
respectively given by (4.3) and (4.4) (see also (4.2) and (4.5)). These mappings
do not require a connection and arise only from the Ô¨Åbre structure of the bundle
space induced from the projection œÄ: E ‚ÜíM.
If a connection ‚àÜh on (E, œÄ, M) is given, it generates horizontal lifts of the
vector Ô¨Åelds on the base space M and of the one-forms on the same base space M
into respectively vector Ô¨Åelds in ‚àÜh and linear mappings on the vector Ô¨Åelds in
‚àÜh. Precisely, if F ‚ààX(M) and œÜ ‚ààŒõ1(M), their horizontal lifts are deÔ¨Åned by
the mappings2
F ‚ÜíF h ‚àà‚àÜh
with
F h : p ‚ÜíF h
p := (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh
p)‚àí1(FœÄ(p))
p ‚ààE
(4.7a)
œÜ ‚ÜíœÜh
with
œÜh := œÜ ‚ó¶œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh : p ‚ÜíœÜh|p = œÜ|œÄ(p) ‚ó¶(œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh
p).
(4.7b)
The horizontal lift œÜh of œÜ can also be deÔ¨Åned alternatively via
œÜh(F h)|p = œÜ(F)|œÄ(p)
(4.8)
which equation is tantamount to (4.7b).
1Since œÄ‚àó(‚àÜv
p) = 0œÄ(p) ‚ààTœÄ(p)(M), p ‚ààE, we can say that only the zero vector Ô¨Åeld over
M has vertical lifts relative to œÄ and any vector Ô¨Åeld in ‚àÜv is its vertical lift. This conclusion is
independent of the existence of a connection on (E, œÄ, M) and depends only on the Ô¨Åbre structure
of E induced by œÄ.
2Alternatively, one may deÔ¨Åne œÜ‚Ä≤
h = œÜ‚ó¶œÄ‚àó= œÄ‚àó(œÜ), which expands the domain of œÜh, deÔ¨Åned
by (4.7b), on the whole space X(E). Obviously, œÜ‚Ä≤
h(Z) = œÜh(Z) for Z ‚àà‚àÜh ‚äÜX(E) and
œÜ‚Ä≤
h(Z) = 0 for Z ‚ààX(E) \ {X ‚àà‚àÜh}.

Let {u¬µ = x¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ, ua} be vector bundle coordinate system and {XI} (resp.

‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ ‚ààX(M), and œÜ = œÜ¬µdx¬µ ‚ààŒõ1(M),
the equations (4.2) and (4.5) imply
Y v = (Y a ‚ó¶œÄ)Xa
œâv = (œâa ‚ó¶œÄ)œâa,

which agree with (3.15).
Exercise 4.1. Consider the vertical and horizontal lifts of vector Ô¨Åelds and 1-forms
in a case of a connection ‚àÜh on the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄT , M).
Exercise 4.2. In a case of the tangent bundle (T (M), œÄT , M) (resp. the cotan-

on an open set WM ‚äÜM induces natural vector bundle coordinates in the
bundle space [7, Section 1.25] (see also [116, pp. 8, 43]). For the purpose, we
put e¬µ =

Linear connections on vector bundles
The most valued structures in/on vector bundles are the ones which are compat-
ible/consistent with the linear structure of the Ô¨Åbres of these bundles. Since a
distribution ‚àÜ: p ‚Üí‚àÜp ‚äÜTp(E), p ‚ààE, on the bundle space E of a (vector)
bundle (E, œÄ, M) cannot be considered as a linear mapping without additional
hypotheses, the concept of a linear connection arises from the one of the parallel
transport assigned to a connection (see DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2). (For an alternative ap-
proach, see [146, p. 42].)

354
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.1. A connection on a vector bundle is called linear if the assigned to
it parallel transport is a linear mapping along every path in the base space, i.e., if
the mapping (3.13) is linear for all paths Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM in the base, viz.
PŒ≥(œÅX) = œÅPŒ≥(X)
(4.12a)
PŒ≥(X + Y ) = PŒ≥(X) + PŒ≥(Y ),
(4.12b)
where œÅ ‚ààK and X, Y ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)).
Remark 4.1. The equivalence between DeÔ¨Ånitions 4.1 and IV.14.3 will be estab-
lished below in Subsection 4.3.
The restriction on a connection to be linear is quite severe and is described
locally by
Theorem 4.1 (cf. [138, Section 5.2]). Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle, {uI} be
vector bundle coordinate system on an open set W ‚äÜE, and ‚àÜh be a connection
on it described in the frame {XI}, adapted to {uI}, by its 2-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
¬µ
(see (3.27)‚Äì(3.29)). The connection ‚àÜh is linear if and only if, for each p ‚ààW,
Œìa
¬µ(p) = ‚àíŒìa
b¬µ(œÄ(p))ub(p) = ‚àí

(Œìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ) ¬∑ ub
(p),
(4.13)
where Œìa
b¬µ : œÄ(W) ‚ÜíK are some functions on the set œÄ(W) ‚äÜM and the minus
sign before Œìa
b¬µ in (4.13) is conventional.
Proof. Let Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíœÄ(W) be a C1 path. Consider the parallel transport equa-
tion (3.39‚Ä≤‚Ä≤a), viz.
d¬ØŒ≥a
p(t)
dt
= Œìa
¬µ(¬ØŒ≥p(t))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t),
(4.14)
where ¬ØŒ≥p : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíW is the horizontal lift of Œ≥ through p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)), ¬ØŒ≥a := ua‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥,
and ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t) = d(x¬µ‚ó¶Œ≥(t))
dt
= d(u¬µ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥(t))
dt
as u¬µ = x¬µ‚ó¶œÄ for some coordinate system {x¬µ}
on œÄ(W).
Sufficiency. If (4.13) holds, (4.14) is transformed into
d¬ØŒ≥a
p(t)
dt
= ‚àíŒìa
b¬µ(Œ≥(t))¬ØŒ≥b
p(t)ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t),
(4.15)
which is a system of r linear Ô¨Årst order ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equations for the
r functions ¬ØŒ≥n+1
p
, . . . , ¬ØŒ≥n+r
p
. According to the general theorems of existence and
uniqueness of the solutions of such systems [34], it has a unique solution
¬ØŒ≥a
p(t) = Y a
b (t)pb
(4.16)
satisfying the initial condition ¬ØŒ≥a
p(œÉ) = ua(p) =: pa, where Y = [Y a
b ] is the funda-
mental solution of (4.15), i.e.,
dY (t)
dt

b¬µ(Œ≥(t))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t)]n+r
a,b=n+1 ¬∑ Y (t)
Y (œÉ) = 1r√ór = [Œ¥a
b ].
(4.17)
The linearity of (3.14) with respect to p follows from (4.16) for t = œÑ.

4. Connections on vector bundles
355
Necessity. Suppose (3.13) is linear in p for all paths Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíœÄ(W).
Then ¬ØŒ≥p(t) := PŒ≥|[œÉ,t](p) is the horizontal lift of Œ≥|[œÉ, t] through p and (cf. (4.16))
¬ØŒ≥a
p(t) = Aa
b(Œ≥(t))pb for some C1 functions Aa
b : œÄ(W) ‚ÜíK. The substitution of
this equation in (4.14) results into
‚àÇAa
b(x)
‚àÇx¬µ
			
x=Œ≥(t)=œÄ(¬ØŒ≥p(t)) ¬∑ ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t)pb = Œìa
¬µ(¬ØŒ≥p(t))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t).
Since Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM, we get equation (4.13) from here, for t = œÉ, with Œìa
b¬µ(x) =
‚àí‚àÇAa
b (x)
‚àÇx¬µ
for x ‚ààœÄ(U).
‚ñ°
The functions Œìa
b¬µ : œÄ(W) ‚ÜíK will be referred as the (local) 3-index coeÔ¨É-
cients of the linear connection ‚àÜh in the adapted frame {XI}. If there is no risk to
confuse them with the 2-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
¬µ : W ‚ÜíK, they will be called simply
coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh. Note, the 2-index coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connections are deÔ¨Åned
on (a subset of) the bundle space E, while the 3-index ones are deÔ¨Åne on (a subset
of) the base space M. The equation (4.15) is simply the parallel transport equation
for the linear connection considered.
Example 4.1. Since ua is replaced by u¬µ
1 = dx¬µ in the tangent bundle case (see
Exercise 4.4), the linear connections in (T (M), œÄT , M) have 2-index coeÔ¨Écients of
the form
ŒìŒΩ
¬µ = ‚àí(ŒìŒΩ
Œª¬µ ‚ó¶œÄT ) ¬∑ uŒª
1 = ‚àí(ŒìŒΩ
Œª¬µ ‚ó¶œÄT ) ¬∑ dxŒª
(4.18)
and, consequently, they can be regarded as 1-forms on M.
Consider a linear connection ‚àÜh on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M). Let Œìa
¬µ and
Œìa
b¬µ be its 2- and 3-index coeÔ¨Écients, respectively, in a frame {XI} adapted to
vector bundle coordinates {uI}.
Corollary 4.1. The 3-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
b¬µ of a linear connection ‚àÜh uniquely
deÔ¨Åne the Ô¨Åbre coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh in {XI} by
‚ó¶Œìa
b¬µ = Œìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ = œÄ‚àó(Œìa
b¬µ),
(4.19)
that is the Ô¨Åbre coeÔ¨Écients of a linear connection are equal to the 3-index ones
lifted by the projection œÄ.
Proof. Since (3.28a) and (4.13) imply
[X¬µ, Xb] = (Œìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)Xa,
(4.20)
the equation (4.19) follows from (3.22a) and (3.23a) or (3.37b) and (4.13).
‚ñ°
As the vector bundle coordinates uI are, by deÔ¨Ånition, linear on the Ô¨Åbres of
the bundle, the general change of such coordinates is
{u¬µ, ua} ‚Üí{Àúu¬µ = Àúx¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ, Àúua = (Ba

follows also from equations (3.24a) and (4.19).
‚ñ°
If we introduce the matrix-valued functions Œì¬µ := [Œìa
b¬µ] and ÀúŒì¬µ := [ÀúŒìa
b¬µ] on
M, we can rewrite (4.23) as (cf. (IV.14.25) with N = M, g = idM, and A = B‚àí1)

This relation corresponds to (3.25) with [Aa

is deÔ¨Åned (E ‚àãp ‚Üíua(p) with p = ua(p)ea(œÄ(p))), transforms via the matrix
inverse to B ‚ó¶œÄ.
Let E be a C2 manifold and ‚àÜh a C1 connection on (E, œÄ, M). Substitut-

Covariant derivatives in vector bundles
A possibility for introduction of diÔ¨Äerentiation in vector bundles, endowed with
connection, comes from the vector space structure of their Ô¨Åbres. This operation
can be deÔ¨Åned in many independent ways, leading to identical results. In one of
them is involved the parallel transport induced by the connection: the idea is
the values of sections to be parallel transported (along paths in the base) into a
single Ô¨Åbre (over the paths), where one can work with the ‚Äòtransported‚Äô sections
as with functions with values in a vector space. Other method uses the existence
of natural vertical lifts of sections of the bundle and horizontal lifts of the vector
Ô¨Åelds on the base space; since the both lifts are vector Ô¨Åelds on the bundle space,
their commutator (or Lie derivative relative to each other) is well deÔ¨Åned and can
be used as a prototype of some sort of diÔ¨Äerentiation. We shall realize below the
second method mentioned, which seems is Ô¨Årst introduced in a rudimentary form
in [138, p. 31].3,4 The Ô¨Årst way, as well as the axiomatic approach, for introduction
of covariant derivatives will be obtained as theorems in what follows.
Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle on which a linear connection ‚àÜh is deÔ¨Åned.
Suppose {Ea} is a frame in E to which vector Ô¨Åbre coordinates ua are associated
and {uI} is the corresponding vector bundle coordinate system. The frame adapted
to {uI} will be denoted by {XI} and {œâI} will be its dual coframe, both deÔ¨Åned
by (3.28) through the (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
¬µ of ‚àÜh.
Let ÀÜZ = ÀÜZaXa ‚àà‚àÜv and ¬ØZ = ¬ØZ¬µX¬µ ‚àà‚àÜh be respectively vertical and
horizontal vector Ô¨Åelds on E. DeÔ¨Åne a mapping ÀÜ‚àá: ‚àÜv ‚äï‚àÜh = T (E) ‚ÜíX(E)
such that5
ÀÜ‚àá: ( ÀÜZ, ¬ØZ) ‚ÜíÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ( ÀÜZ) := Œ†(L ¬ØZ ÀÜZ) ‚ààX(E),
(4.27)
3In [138, p. 31] is proved that, for F =
‚àÇ
‚àÇx¬µ and in our notation, the ath component of the
right hand sides of (4.35) and of (4.36) coincide in a frame {Ea} in E.
4An equivalent alternative approach is realized in [23, Sections 2.49‚Äì2.52].
5The idea of the construction (4.27) is to drag the vertical vector Ô¨Åeld ÀÜZ along the horizontal
one ¬ØZ, which will give a vector Ô¨Åeld in X(E), and then to project the result onto the vertical
distribution ‚àÜv by means of the invariant projection operator Œ† = Xa ‚äóœâa : X(E) ‚ÜíX(E).
Evidently Œ†2 = Œ† ‚ó¶Œ† = Œ† and Œ† is the unit (identity) tensor in the tensor product of vector
Ô¨Åelds and 1-forms on E.

Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
where the (1,1) tensor Ô¨Åeld
Œ† :=

a
Xa ‚äóœâa
(4.28)
is considered as a operator on the set of vector Ô¨Åelds on E. Since (see (2.1b)
and (III.2.1))
L ¬ØZ ÀÜZ = ¬ØZ( ÀÜZa)Xa + ¬ØZ¬µ ÀÜZa[X¬µ, Xa]
and œâa(X¬µ) = Œ¥a
¬µ = 0, from (3.36), (3.37b) and (4.27), we obtain
ÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ ÀÜZ = ¬ØZ¬µ{X¬µ( ÀÜZa) ‚àíÀÜZb‚àÇb(Œìa
¬µ)}Xa,
(4.29)
from where one can prove, via direct calculation, the independence of ÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ ÀÜZ of
the particular (co)frame used. For any particular point p ‚ààE, the value of the
vector Ô¨Åeld (4.29) at p is a vertical vector, ( ÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ ÀÜZ)|p ‚àà‚àÜv
p, but generally ÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ ÀÜZ
is not a vertical vector Ô¨Åeld. The reason is that a vertical vector Ô¨Åeld on E is a
mapping V : p ‚ÜíVp ‚àà‚àÜv
p := Tp(œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p)) := Tƒ±(p)(œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p)) = (œÄ‚àó|p)‚àí1(0œÄ(p)),
with ƒ±: œÄ‚àí1(p) ‚ÜíE being the inclusion mapping and 0œÄ(p) ‚ààTœÄ(p)(M) being the
zero vector, due to which Vp, and hence its components, must depend only on
œÄ(p) ‚ààM. Therefore, we have
ÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ ÀÜZ ‚àà‚àÜv ‚áê‚áí‚àÇb(Œìa
¬µ) = ‚àíŒìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ ‚áê‚áíŒìa
¬µ = ‚àí(Œìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ) ¬∑ ub + Ga
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ, (4.30)
for some functions Œìa
b¬µ, Ga
¬µ : M ‚ÜíK. Thus ÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ ÀÜZ is a vertical vector Ô¨Åeld if and
only if the 2-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
¬µ in {XI} of the connection ‚àÜh are of the form
Œìa
¬µ = ‚àí(Œìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ) ¬∑ ub + Ga
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ.
(4.31)
This equality selects the set of aÔ¨Éne connections among all connections (see Sub-
section 4.4 below);6 in particular, of this type are the linear connections for which
Ga
¬µ = 0 and Œìa
b¬µ are their 3-index coeÔ¨Écients (see (4.13)). For connections with
2-index coeÔ¨Écients (4.31), equation (4.29) reduces to
ÀÜ‚àá¬ØZ ÀÜZ = ¬ØZ¬µ{X¬µ( ÀÜZa) + ÀÜZb(Œìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)}Xa ‚àà‚àÜv.
(4.32)
Now the idea of introduction of a covariant derivative of a section Y ‚àà
Sec(E, œÄ, M) along a vector Ô¨Åeld F ‚ààX(M) is to ‚Äòlower‚Äô the operator ÀÜ‚àáfrom
T (E) to T (M).
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2. A covariant derivative or covariant derivative operator, associated
to a linear (or aÔ¨Éne) connection ‚àÜh on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M), is a mapping
‚àá: X(M) √ó Sec1(E, œÄ, M) ‚ÜíSec0(E, œÄ, M)
‚àá: (F, Y ) ‚Üí‚àáF Y
(4.33)
6Usually the aÔ¨Éne connections are deÔ¨Åned on aÔ¨Éne bundles [11,146].

such that, for F ‚ààX(M) and Y ‚ààSec1(E, œÄ, M), ‚àáF Y is the unique section of
(E, œÄ, M) whose vertical lift is ÀÜ‚àáF hY v, with ÀÜ‚àádeÔ¨Åned by (4.27) (or (4.32)), viz.
(‚àáF Y )v := ÀÜ‚àáF hY v
(4.34)
or
‚àáF Y = v‚àí1 ‚ó¶ÀÜ‚àá(œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1(F )(v(Y )) = (v‚àí1 ‚ó¶ÀÜ‚àá(œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1(F ) ‚ó¶v)(Y ),
(4.35)
where F h ‚àà‚àÜh and Y v ‚àà‚àÜv are respectively the horizontal and vertical lifts of
F and Y .
Remark 4.2. DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2 and the rest of this subsection are valid also for aÔ¨Éne
connections for which (4.31) holds, not only for the linear ones. For some details,
see Subsection 4.4.
Proposition 4.3. Let {Ea} be a frame in E and {x¬µ} local coordinate system on
M. If Y = Y aEa ‚ààSec1(E, œÄ, M) and F = F ¬µ

Proposition 4.4. Let ‚àÜh be a linear connection on (E, œÄ, M) and P be the generated
by it parallel transport. Let x ‚ààM, Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM, Œ≥(t0) = x for some t0 ‚àà[œÉ, œÑ],

Remark 4.3. The mapping P : Œ≥ ‚ÜíP Œ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíP Œ≥

along paths ‚Äì see Proposition 8.6 on page 395.
By Proposition 4.4, the equation (4.37) can be used as an equivalent deÔ¨Ånition
of a covariant derivative associated with a linear connection.

Proposition 4.5. Let F, G ‚ààX(M), Y, Z ‚ààSec1(E, œÄ, M), and f : M ‚ÜíK be a C1
function. Then:
‚àáF +GY = ‚àáF Y + ‚àáGY

‚àáfF Y = f‚àáF Y
(4.39b)
‚àáF (Y + Z) = ‚àáF Y + ‚àáF Z

‚àáF (fY ) = F(f) ¬∑ Y + f ¬∑ ‚àáF Y.
(4.39d)
Proof. Apply (4.36).
‚ñ°
Proposition 4.6. If a mapping (4.33) satisÔ¨Åes (4.39), there exists a unique linear
connection ‚àÜh, the assigned to which covariant derivative is exactly ‚àá.
Proof.

position

(4.40)
A simple veriÔ¨Åcation proves that they transform according to (4.23) and hence the
quantities (4.13) transform by (3.32). Proposition 3.3 ensures the existence of a
unique linear connection whose 2-index (3-index) coeÔ¨Écients are Œìa
¬µ (Œìa
b¬µ). Thus
the covariant derivative of Y ‚ààSec(E, œÄ, M) relative to F ‚ààX(M) is given by the
right-hand side of (4.36). On another hand, (4.39) entail (4.36), with Œìa
b¬µ deÔ¨Åned
by (4.40), so that ‚àáis exactly the covariant derivative operator assigned to the
connection with 3-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
b¬µ.
‚ñ°
Consequently, equations (4.39) and (4.40) provide a third equivalent deÔ¨Å-
nition of a covariant derivative (covariant derivative operator). Moreover, since
Proposition 4.6 establishes a bijective correspondence between linear connections
and operators (4.33) satisfying (4.39), quite often such operators are called linear
connections.7 As it is clear from the proof of Proposition 4.6, the bijection be-
tween linear connections and covariant derivative operators is locally given by the
coincidence of their (3-index) coeÔ¨Écients and components, respectively.
The four equations (4.39) are identical with conditions (i)‚Äì(iv) in DeÔ¨Åni-
tion IV.14.7 for N = M and g = idM. This fact means that a covariant derivative
according to DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2 is a covariant derivative in (E, œÄ, M) according to Def-
inition IV.14.7 and vice versa, so that the both deÔ¨Ånitions are equivalent (for
N = M and g = idM in the latter one). Combining that result with Conclu-
sion IV.14.1, we see that the DeÔ¨Ånitions 4.1 and IV.14.3 of a linear connection on
a vector bundle are equivalent (see also DeÔ¨Ånition 3.1).
Exercise 4.3. A C1 section œâ = œâaEa of the bundle dual to (E, œÄ, M) can be
diÔ¨Äerentiated covariantly similarly as the sections of (E, œÄ, M). Show that the
corresponding operator, say ‚àá‚àó, can equivalently be deÔ¨Åned by (the ‚ÄòLeibnitz
rule‚Äô)
(‚àá‚àó

AÔ¨Éne connections

when the vector bundle coordinates or adapted frames undergo the change (4.21)

Consequently, the functions Œìa

the type (4.46) is as follows.
DeÔ¨Ånition 4.3. A connection on a vector bundle is termed aÔ¨Éne connection if the
assigned to it parallel transport P is an aÔ¨Éne mapping along all paths Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚Üí
M in the base space, i.e.,
PŒ≥(œÅX) = œÅPŒ≥(X) + (1 ‚àíœÅ)PŒ≥(0)
(4.49a)
PŒ≥(X + Y ) = PŒ≥(X) + PŒ≥(Y ) ‚àíPŒ≥(0),
(4.49b)
where œÅ ‚ààK, X, Y ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)), and 0 is the zero vector in the Ô¨Åbre œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)),
which is a K-vector space.
An aÔ¨Éne connection for which PŒ≥(0) is the zero vector in œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÑ)) is a
linear connection and vice versa ‚Äì see DeÔ¨Ånitions 4.1 and 4.3.
Theorem 4.2. Let (E, œÄ, M) be a vector bundle, {uI} be vector bundle coordinate
system over an open set U ‚äÜE, and ‚àÜh be a connection on it with 2-index coeÔ¨É-
cients Œìa
¬µ in the frame {XI} adapted to {uI}. The connection ‚àÜh is an aÔ¨Éne con-
nection if and only if equation (4.46) holds for some functions Œìa
b¬µ,Ga
¬µ : œÄ(U)‚ÜíK.
Proof (cf. the proof of Theorem 4.1).
Take a C1 path Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíœÄ(U) and
consider the parallel transport equation (3.39‚Ä≤‚Ä≤a), viz.
d¬ØŒ≥a
p(t)
dt
= Œìa
¬µ(¬ØŒ≥p(t))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t),
(4.50)
where ¬ØŒ≥p : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíU is the horizontal lift of Œ≥ through p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)), ¬ØŒ≥a := ua‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥,
and ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t) =
d(x¬µ‚ó¶Œ≥(t))
dt
=
d(u¬µ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥(t))
dt
as u¬µ = x¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ for some coordinates {x¬µ}
on œÄ(U).
Sufficiency. If (4.46) holds, equation (4.50) can be transformed into

b¬µ(Œ≥(t))¬ØŒ≥b
p(t)ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t) + Ga

which is a system of r linear inhomogeneous Ô¨Årst order ordinary diÔ¨Äerential equa-
tions for the r functions ¬ØŒ≥n+1

existence and uniqueness of the solutions of such systems [34], it has a unique
solution
¬ØŒ≥a
p(t) = Y a
b (t)pb + ya(t)
(4.52)
satisfying the initial condition ¬ØŒ≥a
p(œÉ) = ua(p) =: pa, where Y = [Y a
b ] is the fun-
damental solution of (4.15) (see (4.17)) and ya(t) is the solution of (4.51) with
ya(t) for ¬ØŒ≥a
p(t) satisfying the initial condition ya(œÉ) = 0. The aÔ¨Énity of (3.13) in
p, i.e., (4.49), follows from (4.52) for t = œÑ.
Necessity. Suppose (3.13) is aÔ¨Éne in p for all paths Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíœÄ(U).
Then ¬ØŒ≥p(t) := PŒ≥|[œÉ,t](p) is the horizontal lift of Œ≥|[œÉ, t] through p and (cf. (4.52))
¬ØŒ≥a
p(t) = Aa
b(Œ≥(t))pb + Aa(Œ≥(t)) for some C1 functions Aa
b, Aa : œÄ(U) ‚ÜíK. The
substitution of this equation in (4.50) results into

x=Œ≥(t)=œÄ(¬ØŒ≥p(t)) ¬∑ ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t)pb + ‚àÇAa(x)

x=Œ≥(t)=œÄ(¬ØŒ≥p(t)) ¬∑ ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t). = Œìa
¬µ(¬ØŒ≥p(t))ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t).
Since Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM, we get equation (4.46) from here, for t = œÉ, with Œìa
b¬µ(x) =

‚àÇx¬µ
and Ga
¬µ(x) = ‚àÇAa(x)

Proposition 4.7. There is a bijective mapping Œ± between the sets of aÔ¨Éne con-
nections and of pairs (‚àá, G) of a linear connection ‚àáand a linear mapping
G: X(M) ‚ÜíEnd(Sec((E, œÄ, M)‚àó)).
Proof. If A‚àÜh is an aÔ¨Éne connection with 2-index coeÔ¨Écients given by (4.46) (see
Theorem 4.2), then (see the discussion after equation (4.46)) to it corresponds
the pair Œ±( A‚àÜh) := ( L‚àÜh, G) of a linear connection, with 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
Œìa
b¬µ and linear mapping G: X(M) ‚ÜíEnd(Sec((E, œÄ, M)‚àó)), with components
Ga
¬µ. Conversely, to a pair ( L‚àÜh, G), locally described via the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
Œìa
b¬µ of
L‚àÜh and components Ga
¬µ of G, there corresponds an aÔ¨Éne connection
A‚àÜh = Œ±‚àí1( L‚àÜh, G) with 2-index coeÔ¨Écients given by (4.46).
‚ñ°
In Subsection 4.3, it was demonstrated that covariant derivatives can be
introduced for aÔ¨Éne connections, not only for linear ones.
Proposition 4.8. The covariant derivative for an aÔ¨Éne connection A‚àÜh coincides
with the one for the linear connection L‚àÜh given via Œ±( A‚àÜh) = ( L‚àÜh, G) with Œ±
deÔ¨Åned in the proof of Proposition 4.7.
Proof. Apply (4.29)‚Äì(4.36).
‚ñ°
If a linear connection L‚àÜh and an aÔ¨Éne one A‚àÜh are connected by Œ±( A‚àÜh) =
( L‚àÜh, G) for some G, then some of their characteristics coincide; e.g., such are their
Ô¨Åbre coeÔ¨Écients (see (3.37b), (4.46) and (4.13)) and all quantities expressed via
the corresponding to them (identical) covariant derivatives. However, quantities,
containing (depending on) partial derivatives relative to the basic coordinates u¬µ,
are generally diÔ¨Äerent for those connections. For instance, if
ARa
¬µŒΩ and
LRa
¬µŒΩ

364
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
are the Ô¨Åbre components of the curvatures of A‚àÜh and L‚àÜh, respectively, then,
by (3.37a) and (4.46), we have
ARa
¬µŒΩ = ‚àí( LRa
b¬µŒΩ ‚ó¶œÄ) ¬∑ ub ‚àíT a
¬µŒΩ ‚ó¶œÄ
(4.53)
LRa
¬µŒΩ = ‚àí( LRa

(4.54)
where (see (4.25))
LRa

(4.56)
and the functions T a
¬µŒΩ have a sense of components of the torsion of L‚àÜh relative
to G [146, pp. 42, 46].
Thus, in general, the aÔ¨Éne connections and linear connections are essentially
diÔ¨Äerent. However, they imply identical theories of covariant derivatives.
If, for some reason, the linear mapping G is Ô¨Åxed, then the set of linear
connections { L‚àÜh} can be identiÔ¨Åed with the subset {Œ±‚àí1( L‚àÜh, G)} of the set of
aÔ¨Éne connections { A‚àÜh}.
Example 4.2. We shall exemplify the above material in a case of the tangent bundle
(T (M), œÄT , M) over a manifold M. Using the base indices ¬µ, ŒΩ, . . . for the Ô¨Åbre
ones a, b, . . . according to the rule a ‚Üí¬µ = a ‚àídim M, we rewrite (4.46) as
Œì¬µ
ŒΩ = ‚àí(Œì¬µ
ŒªŒΩ ‚ó¶œÄT ) ¬∑ uŒª
1 + G¬µ
ŒΩ ‚ó¶œÄT .
(4.57)
Now the aÔ¨Éne connections on (T (M), œÄT , M) are the generalized aÔ¨Éne connections
on M [11, Chapter III, ¬ß 3]. The choice of G via
G¬µ
ŒΩ : M ‚ÜíŒ¥¬µ
ŒΩ ,
(4.58)
which corresponds to the identical transformation of the spaces tangent to M,
singles out the set of aÔ¨Éne connections on M‚Äì see [11, Chapter III, ¬ß 3] or [23,
pp. 103‚Äì105] ‚Äì (known also as Cartan connections on M [146, p. 46]) whose 2-index
coeÔ¨Écients have the form (see (4.57), (4.11a) and (4.58))
Œì¬µ
ŒΩ = ‚àí(Œì¬µ
ŒªŒΩ ‚ó¶œÄT ) ¬∑ dxŒª + Œ¥¬µ
ŒΩ .
(4.59)
Combining this example with Proposition 4.7, we derive
Proposition 4.9 (cf. [11, Chapter III, ¬ß 3, Theorem 3.3]). There is a bijective
correspondence between the sets of linear connections and of aÔ¨Éne ones on a
manifold.
Often the terms ‚Äúlinear connection‚Äù and ‚ÄúaÔ¨Éne connection‚Äù on a manifold
are used as synonyms, due to the last result.

General (co)frames
Until now two special kinds of local (co)frames in the (co)tangent bundle to the
bundle space of a bundle were employed, viz. the natural holonomic ones, in-
duced by some local coordinates, and the adapted (co)frames determined by local
coordinates and a connection on the bundle. The present section is devoted to
(re)formulation of some important results and formulae in arbitrary (co)frames,
which in particular can be natural or adapted (if a connection is presented) ones.
Let (E, œÄ, M) be a C2 bundle and {eI} a (local) frame in T (E). The com-
ponents CK
IJ of the anholonomicity object of {eI} are deÔ¨Åned by (3.19) and a
change

(5.2)
Let a connection ‚àÜh on (E, œÄ, M) be given. If {eI} is a specialized frame
for ‚àÜh (see Subsection 3.2), then the set {CK
IJ} is naturally divided into the six
groups (3.20). The value of that division is in its invariance with respect to the
class of specialized frames, which means that, if {¬ØeI} is also a specialized frame,
then the transformed components of the elements of each group are functions only
in the elements of the non-transformed components of the same group ‚Äì see (3.24),
(3.21), and (2.7).
Exercise 5.1. By means of (5.1), prove that, if a division like (3.20) holds in a
frame {eI}, then it holds in {¬ØeI} if and only if the matrix-valued function B is of
the form (3.16).
In particular, we cannot talk about Ô¨Åbre coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh and of Ô¨Åbre com-
ponents of the curvature of ‚àÜh in frames more general than the specialized ones
as in that case the transformation (5.1), with {eI} (resp. {¬ØeI}) being a specialized
(resp. non-specialized) frame, will mix, for instance, the Ô¨Åbre coeÔ¨Écients and the
curvature‚Äôs Ô¨Åbre components of ‚àÜh in {¬ØeI} ‚Äì see (5.2).
It is a simple, but important, fact that the specialized frames are (up to
renumbering) the most general ones which respect the splitting of T (E) into ver-
tical and horizontal components. Suppose {eI} is a specialized frame. Then the
general element of the set of all specialized frames is (see (3.4a) and (3.16))

where {eI} is the specialized coframe dual to {eI}, eI(eJ) = Œ¥I
J.
Since œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh : {X ‚àà‚àÜh} ‚ÜíX(M) is an isomorphism, any basis {Œµ¬µ} for ‚àÜh
deÔ¨Ånes a basis {E¬µ} of X(M) such that
E¬µ = œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh(Œµ¬µ)
(5.4)
and v.v., a basis {E¬µ} for X(M) induces a basis {Œµ¬µ} for ‚àÜh via
Œµ¬µ = (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1(E¬µ).
(5.5)
Similarly, there is a bijection {Œµ¬µ} ‚Üí{E¬µ} between the ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô coframes {Œµ¬µ}
and the coframes {E¬µ} dual to the frames in T (M) (E¬µ ‚ààŒõ1(M), E¬µ(EŒΩ) = Œ¥¬µ
ŒΩ ).
Thus a ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô change
Œµ¬µ ‚Üí¬ØŒµ¬µ = (BŒΩ
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)ŒµŒΩ,
(5.6)
which is independent of a ‚Äòvertical‚Äô one given by
Œµa ‚Üí¬ØŒµa = (Bb
a ‚ó¶œÄ)Œµb
(5.7)
with {Œµa} being a basis for ‚àÜv, is equivalent to the transformation
E¬µ ‚Üí¬ØE¬µ = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ
(5.8)
of the basis {E¬µ} for X(M), related via (5.4) to the basis {Œµ¬µ} for ‚àÜh. Here [BŒΩ
¬µ]
and [Bb
a] are non-degenerate matrix-valued functions on M.
As œÄ‚àó(Œµa) = 0 ‚ààX(M), the ‚Äòvertical‚Äô transformations (5.7) do not admit
interpretation analogous to the ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô ones (5.6). However, in a case of a
vector bundle (E, œÄ, M), they are tantamount to changes of frames in the bundle
space E, i.e., of the bases for Sec(E, œÄ, M). Indeed, if v is the mapping deÔ¨Åned
by (4.3), the sections
Ea = v‚àí1(Œµa)
(5.9)
form a basis for Sec(E, œÄ, M) as the vertical vector Ô¨Åelds Œµa form a basis for ‚àÜv.
Conversely, any basis {Ea} for the sections of (E, œÄ, M) induces a basis {Œµa} for
‚àÜv such that
Œµa = v(Ea).
(5.10)
As v and v‚àí1 are linear, the change (5.7) is equivalent to the transformation
Ea ‚Üí¬ØEa = Bb
aEb
(5.11)
of the frame {Ea} in E related to {Œµa} via (5.9). In this way, we have proved the
following result.

5. General (co)frames
367
Proposition 5.1. There is a bijective correspondence between the set of special-
ized frames {ŒµI} = {Œµ¬µ, Œµa} on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) and the set of pairs
({E¬µ}, {Ea}) of frames {E¬µ} on T (M) over M and {Ea} on E over M.1
Since conceptually the frames in T (M) and E are easier to be understood
and in some cases have a direct physical interpretation, one often works with the
pair ({E¬µ = œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh(Œµ¬µ)}, {Ea = v‚àí1(Œµa)}) of frames instead with a specialized
frame {ŒµI} = {Œµ¬µ, Œµa}; for instance {E¬µ} and {Ea} can be completely arbitrary
frames in T (M) and E, respectively, while the specialized frames represent only a
particular class of frames in T (E).
One can mutatis mutandis localize the above considerations when M is re-
placed with an open subset UM in M and E is replaced with W = œÄ‚àí1(UM). Such
a localization is important when the bases/frames considered are connected with
some local coordinates or when they should be smooth.2
Let us turn now our attention to frames adapted to local coordinate system
{uI} on an open set W ‚äÜE for a given connection ‚àÜh on a general C1 bundle
(E, œÄ, M) (see (3.27)‚Äì(3.30)). Since in their deÔ¨Ånition the local coordinates uI
enter only via the vector Ô¨Åelds ‚àÇI :=
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI ‚ààX(E), we can generalize this deÔ¨Ånition
by replacing {‚àÇI} with an arbitrary frame {eI} deÔ¨Åned in T (E) over an open set
W ‚äÜE and such that {ea|p} is a basis for the space Tp(œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p))) tangent to the
Ô¨Åbre through p ‚ààW. So, using {eI} for {‚àÇI}, we have
(eW
¬µ , eW
a ) = (DŒΩ

where {eW

matrix-valued functions on W, and Da
¬µ : W ‚ÜíK.
DeÔ¨Ånition 5.1. The specialized frame {XI} over W in T (W), obtained from (5.12)
via an admissible transformation (3.4a) with matrix A =

[D¬µ

adapted to the frame {eI} for ‚àÜh.3
Exercise 5.2. Using (3.4) and (3.16), verify that the adapted frame {XI} and
coframe {œâI} dual to it are independent of the particular specialized frame {eW
I }
entering into their deÔ¨Ånitions via (5.12). The equalities (5.13a) and (5.21) derived
below are indirect proof of that fact too.
1It should be mentioned the evident fact that a frame {E¬µ} in T(M) over M is also a basis
for the module X(M) of vector Ô¨Åelds over M and hence is a basis for the set Sec(T(M), œÄT , M)
of section of the bundle tangent to M, due to X(M) = Sec(T(M), œÄT , M). Similarly, a frame
{Ea} on E over M is a basis for the set Sec(E, œÄ, M) of sections of the vector bundle (E, œÄ, M).
2Recall, not every manifold admits a global nowhere vanishing Cm, m ‚â•0, vector Ô¨Åeld
(see [153] or [1, Section 4.24]); e.g., such are the even-dimensional spheres S2k, k ‚ààN, in Euclidean
space.
3Recall, here and below the adapted frames are deÔ¨Åned only with respect to frames {eI} =
{e¬µ, ea} such that {ea} is a basis for the vertical distribution ‚àÜv over W , i.e., {ea|p} is a basis
for ‚àÜv
p for all p ‚ààW . Since ‚àÜv is integrable, the relation ea ‚àà‚àÜv for all a = n + 1, . . . , n + r
implies [ea, eb] ‚àà‚àÜv for all a, b = n + 1, . . . , n + r.

¬µ = 0. If {YI} is a specialized frame,
it is adapted to any frame {e¬µ = AŒΩ
¬µYŒΩ, ea = Ab
aYb} and hence any specialized
frame can be considered as an adapted one; in particular, any specialized frame is
a frame adapted to itself. Obviously (see (5.14)), the coeÔ¨Écients of a connection
identically vanish in a given specialized frame considered as an adapted one. This
leads to the concept of a normal frame to which is devoted Section 6 below. Besides,
from the above observation follows that the set of adapted frames coincides with
the one of specialized frames.

Example 5.1. If {eI} and {ÀúeI} are the frames generated by local coordinates {uI}
and {ÀúuI}, viz. eI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI and ÀúeI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI , the changes (5.16) and (5.17) reduce
to (3.31) and (3.32), respectively. The choice eI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI also reduces DeÔ¨Ånition 5.1
to DeÔ¨Ånition 3.5.
A result similar to Proposition 3.3 is valid too provided in its formulation
equation (3.32) is replaced with (5.17).

¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ for some xŒΩ
¬µ : œÄ(W) ‚ÜíK
such that det[xŒΩ

{x¬µ := xŒΩ
¬µ
‚àÇ
‚àÇxŒΩ }, then
œÄ‚àó(X¬µ) = x¬µ,
(5.20)
by virtue of (3.33) and (3.35). Thus, we have (cf. (3.34))
X¬µ = (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1(x¬µ) = (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1 ‚ó¶œÄ‚àó(e¬µ)
(5.21)
which can be used in an equivalent deÔ¨Ånition of a frame {XI} adapted to {eI}
(with {ea} being a basis for ‚àÜv): X¬µ should be deÔ¨Åned by (5.21) and Xa = ea.
If one accepts such a deÔ¨Ånition of an adapted frame, the 2-index coeÔ¨Écients of
a connection should be deÔ¨Åned via the equation (5.13a), not by (5.14), and the
proofs of some results, like (5.16) and (5.17), should be modiÔ¨Åed.
Proposition 5.3. If {XI} is a frame adapted to a frame {eI}, with {ea} being a

Proof. Insert equation (5.13a) into the corresponding commutators, use the def-
inition (5.23c) of the components of the anholonomicity object of {eI}, and ap-
ply (5.13a). Notice, as {ea} is a basis for the integrable distribution ‚àÜv, we have
[ea, eb] ‚àà‚àÜv and consequently CŒª
ab ‚â°0.
‚ñ°
The functions Ra
¬µŒΩ are the Ô¨Åbre components of the curvature of ‚àÜh and ‚ó¶Œìa
b¬µ
are the Ô¨Åbre coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh in the adapted frame {XI}; if eI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI for some
bundle coordinates {uI} on E, they reduce to (3.37a) and (3.37b), respectively.
From (5.22), we immediately derive
Corollary 5.1. A connection ‚àÜh is integrable iÔ¨Äin some (and hence any) adapted
frame
Ra
¬µŒΩ = 0.
(5.24)
Corollary 5.2. An adapted frame {XI} is (locally) holonomic iÔ¨Äin it
Ra
¬µŒΩ = ‚ó¶Œìa
b¬µ = SŒª
¬µŒΩ = Cd
ab = CŒª
¬µb = 0.
(5.25)
If the initial frame {eI} is changed into (5.15), then the transformation laws
of the quantities (5.23) follow from (5.22) and (5.16); in particular, the curvature
components transform according to the tensor equation (3.24b).
Let us now pay attention to the case when (E, œÄ, M) is a vector bundle
endowed with a connection ‚àÜh.
According to the above-said in this section, any adapted frame {XI} =
{X¬µ, Xa} in T (E) is equivalent to a pair of frames in T (M) and E according
to
{X¬µ, Xa} ‚Üî({E¬µ = œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh(X¬µ)}, {Ea = v‚àí1(Xa)}).
(5.26)
Therefore the vertical and horizontal lifts are given by (cf. Lemma 4.1, (4.7a)
and (4.10))
Sec(E, œÄ, M) ‚àãY = Y aEa
v‚àí‚Üív(Y ) := Y v = (Y a ‚ó¶œÄ)Xa ‚àà‚àÜv
(5.27a)
X(M) ‚àãF = F ¬µE¬µ
h‚àí‚Üíh(F) := F h = (F ¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)X¬µ ‚àà‚àÜh.
(5.27b)

5. General (co)frames
371
Thus, we have the linear isomorphism
(h, v): X(M) √ó Sec(E, œÄ, M) ‚ÜíX(E)
(h, v): (F, Y ) ‚Üí(F h, Y v)
(5.28)
which explains why the covariant derivatives (see DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2) represent an
equivalent description of the linear connections in vector bundles. Since any vector
Ô¨Åeld Œæ = (ŒæI ‚ó¶œÄ)XI ‚ààX(E) has a unique decomposition Œæ = Œæh ‚äïŒæv, with
Œæh = (Œæ¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)X¬µ and Œæv = (Œæa ‚ó¶œÄ)Xa, we have
(h, v)‚àí1(Œæ) = (œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh(Œæh), v‚àí1(Œæv)) = (Œæ¬µE¬µ, ŒæaEa).
(5.29)
Suppose {XI} and { ÀúXI} are two adapted frames. Then they are connected
via (cf. (5.3a) and (5.16))
ÀúX¬µ = (BŒΩ
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)XŒΩ
ÀúXa = (Bb
a ‚ó¶œÄ)Xb,
(5.30)
where [BŒΩ
¬µ] and [Bb

pairs of frames corresponding to them, in accordance with (5.26), are related via
ÀúE¬µ = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ
ÀúEa = Bb

(5.31)
and vice versa.
Proposition 5.4. Let ‚àÜh be a linear connection on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) and
{XI} be the frame adapted for ‚àÜh to a frame {eI} such that {ea} is a basis for
‚àÜv. Let {uI} = {u¬µ, ua} be vector bundle coordinate system on U ‚äÜE. Suppose
that the frame {eI}, to which {XI} is adapted to, is such that

‚àÇuI , [BŒΩ

(5.33)
on U for some functions Œìa
b¬µ : œÄ(U) ‚ÜíK, called 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh in
{XI}.
Remark 5.1. The representation (5.33) is not valid for frames more general than
the ones given by (5.32). Precisely, equation (5.33) is valid if and only if (5.32)
holds for some local coordinates {uI} on W ‚Äì see (5.17).
Remark 5.2. Since the vector Ô¨Åbre coordinates ua are 1-forms on U, the 2-index
coeÔ¨Écients (5.33) of a linear connection are also 1-forms on the bundle space.

in (5.34).4 Then, due to (5.17) and (5.33), the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients Œìa

Exercise 5.4. Prove that the transformation {eI} ‚Üí{ÀúeI}, with the frame {ÀúeI}
given by (5.34), is the most general one that preserves the existence of 3-index
coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh provided they exist in {eI} in a sense that, if {eI} is given
by (5.32) (which leads to (5.33)) and {ÀúeI} is given by (5.34), then there exist
vector bundle coordinates {ÀúuI} which generate {ÀúeI} according to (5.32) with ÀúeI
for eI, Àú‚àÇI for ‚àÇI and some B‚Äôs, which leads to (5.33) with ÀúŒì for Œì and Àúu for u.
Introducing the matrices Œì¬µ := [Œìa
b¬µ]n+r
a,b=n+1, ÀúŒì¬µ := [ÀúŒìa
b¬µ]n+r
a,b=n+1, B := [Ba
b ],
and B¬µ := [Ba
b¬µ], we rewrite (5.35) as (cf. (4.23‚Ä≤))
ÀúŒì¬µ = B‚àí1 ¬∑ (ŒìŒΩBŒΩ
¬µ + B¬µ) ¬∑ B.
(5.35‚Ä≤)
A little below (see the text after equation (5.37)), we shall prove that the compat-
ibility of the developed formalism with the theory of covariant derivatives requires
further restrictions on the general transformed frames (5.15) to the ones given
by (5.34) with
B¬µ = ÀúE¬µ(B) ¬∑ B‚àí1 = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ(B) ¬∑ B‚àí1,
(5.36)
where ÀúE¬µ := œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh( ÀúX¬µ) = œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh((BŒΩ
¬µ‚ó¶œÄ)XŒΩ) = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ. In this case, (5.35‚Ä≤) reduces
to (cf. (4.23‚Ä≤))
ÀúŒì¬µ = BŒΩ
¬µB‚àí1 ¬∑ (ŒìŒΩ ¬∑ B + EŒΩ(B)) = BŒΩ
¬µ(B‚àí1 ¬∑ ŒìŒΩ ‚àíEŒΩ(B‚àí1)) ¬∑ B.
(5.37)
4Notice, from (5.34) follows that the vector Ô¨Åbre coordinate systems {ua} and {Àúua} are
connected via ua = (Ba

5. General (co)frames
373
At last, a few words on the covariant derivative operators ‚àáare in or-
der. Without lost of generality, we deÔ¨Åne such an operator (4.33) via the equa-
tions (4.39). Suppose {E¬µ} is a basis for X(M) and {Ea} is a one for Sec1(E, œÄ, M).
DeÔ¨Åne the components Œìa
b¬µ : M ‚ÜíK of ‚àáin the pair of frames ({E¬µ}, {Ea}) by
(cf. (4.40))
‚àáE¬µ(Eb) = Œìa
b¬µEa.
(5.38)
Then (4.39) imply (cf. (4.36))
‚àáF Y = F ¬µ(E¬µ(Y a) + Œìa
b¬µY b)Ea
for all F = F ¬µE¬µ ‚ààX(M) and Y = Y aEa ‚ààSec1(E, œÄ, M). A frame change
({E¬µ}, {Ea}) ‚Üí({ ÀúE¬µ}, { ÀúEa}), given via (5.31), entails

as a result of (5.38). In a more compact matrix form, the last result reads
ÀúŒì¬µ = BŒΩ

(5.39‚Ä≤)
with Œì¬µ := [Œìa
b¬µ], ÀúŒì¬µ := [ÀúŒìa
b¬µ], and B := [Ba
b ].
Thus, if we identify the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh, deÔ¨Åned by (5.33), with the
components of ‚àá, deÔ¨Åned by (5.38),5 then the quantities (5.35‚Ä≤) and (5.39‚Ä≤) must
coincide, which immediately leads to the equality (5.36). Therefore

is the most general transformation between frames in T (E) such that the frames

induced by vector bundle coordinates {uI} on E ‚Äì see (4.21) and (3.1)‚Äì(3.3); the
rest members of the class of frames mentioned are obtained from them via (5.40)
with eI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI and non-degenerate matrix-valued functions [BŒΩ
¬µ] and B.
If {XI} (resp. { ÀúXI}) is the frame adapted to a frame {eI} (resp. {ÀúeI}), then
the change {eI} ‚Üí{ÀúeI}, given by (5.40), entails {XI} ‚Üí{ ÀúXI} with { ÀúXI} given
by (5.30) (see (5.15) and (5.16)). Since the last transformation is tantamount to
the change
({E¬µ}, {Ea}) ‚Üí({ ÀúE¬µ}, { ÀúEa})
(5.41)
of the basis of X(M) √ó Sec(E, œÄ, M) corresponding to {XI} via the isomor-
phism (5.28) (see (5.26), (5.30), and (5.31)), we can say that the transition (5.41)
5Such an identiÔ¨Åcation is justiÔ¨Åed by the deÔ¨Ånition of ‚àávia the parallel transport assigned
to ‚àÜh (see Proposition 4.4) or via a projection, generated by ‚àÜh, of a suitable Lie derivative on
X(E) (see DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2).

374
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
induces the change (5.39) of the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of the connection ‚àÜh. Exactly
the same is the situation one meets in the literature [7, 11, 23] when covariant
derivatives are considered (and identiÔ¨Åed with connections).
Regardless that the change (5.40) of the frames in T (E) looks quite special,
it is the most general one that, through (5.16) and (5.26), is equivalent to an
arbitrary change (5.41) of a basis in X(M)√óSec(E, œÄ, M), i.e., of a pair of frames
in T (M) and E.
We would like to remark that, in the general case, equation (4.43) also holds
with F = F ¬µE¬µ, G = G¬µE¬µ, and
(R(E¬µ, EŒΩ))(Eb) = Ra
b¬µŒΩEa,

The above results, concerning linear connections on vector bundles, can be
generalized for aÔ¨Éne connections on vector bundles. For instance, the analogue of
Propositions 5.4 reads.
Proposition 5.5. Let ‚àÜh be an aÔ¨Éne connection on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) and
{X¬µ} be the frame adapted for ‚àÜh to a frame {eI} such that {ea} is a basis for

Remark 5.3. The representation (5.45) is not valid for frames more general than
the ones given by (5.44). Precisely, equation (5.45) is valid if and only if (5.44)
holds for some local coordinate system {uI} on U ‚Äì see (5.17).
Proof. Writing the equation (5.17) for the transformation {‚àÇI} ‚Üí{eI}, with {eI}

6.
Normal frames
In the theory of linear connections on a manifold, the normal frames are deÔ¨Åned as
frames in the tangent bundle space in which the connections‚Äô (3-index) coeÔ¨Écients
vanish on some subset of the manifold (see DeÔ¨Ånition I.5.1 on page 37). The
deÔ¨Ånition of normal frames for a connection on a vector bundle is practically the
same, the only diÔ¨Äerence being that these frames are in the bundle space, not
in the tangent bundle space over the base space (see Sections IV.8 and IV.14.4).
The present section is devoted to the introduction of normal frames for general
connections on Ô¨Åbre bundles and some their properties.
6.1.
The general case
To save some space and for brevity, in what follows we shall not indicate explicitly
that the frames {eI} = {e¬µ, ea}, with respect to which the adapted frames are
deÔ¨Åned, are such that {ea} is a (local) basis for the vertical distribution ‚àÜv on the
bundle considered.
DeÔ¨Ånition 6.1. Given a connection ‚àÜh on a bundle (E, œÄ, M) and a subset W ‚äÜE.
A frame {XI} in T (E) adapted to a frame {eI} in T (E) and deÔ¨Åned over an open
subset V of E containing or equal to W, V ‚äáW, is called normal for ‚àÜh over/on

376
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
W (relative to {eI}) if all (2-index) coeÔ¨Écients Œìa
¬µ of ‚àÜh vanish in it everywhere
on W. Respectively, {XI} is normal for ‚àÜh along a mapping g: Q ‚ÜíE, Q Ã∏= ‚àÖ,
if {XI} is normal for ‚àÜh over the set g(Q).
Let {XI} be the frame in T (E) adapted to a frame {eI} in T (E) over an
open subset V ‚äÜE. Then the frame { ÀúXI} in T (E) adapted to a frame {ÀúeI}, given
by (5.15), in T (E) over the same subset V is normal for ‚àÜh over W ‚äÜV if and
only if
(AŒΩ
¬µŒìb
ŒΩ ‚àíAb
¬µ)|W = 0,
(6.1)
due to (5.16) and (5.17). Since Œìb
¬µ depend only on ‚àÜh and {eI}, the existence
of solutions of (6.1), relative to AŒΩ
¬µ and Ab
¬µ, and their properties are completely
responsible for the existence and the properties of frames normal for ‚àÜh over W.
For that reason, we call (6.1) the (system of ) equation(s) of the normal frames for
‚àÜh over W or simply the normal frame (system of ) equation(s) (for ‚àÜh over W).
In the most general case, when no additional restrictions on the frames con-
sidered are imposed, the normal frame equation (6.1) is a system of nr linear
algebraic equations for nr + n2 variables and, consequently, it has a solution de-
pending on n2 independent parameters. In particular, if we choose the functions
AŒΩ
¬µ : W ‚ÜíK (with det[AŒΩ
¬µ] Ã∏= 0, ‚àû) as such parameters, we can write the general
solution of (6.1) as
({AŒΩ
¬µ}, {Ab
¬µ})|W = ({AŒΩ
¬µ}, {Œìb
ŒΩAŒΩ
¬µ})|W .
(6.2)
It should be noted, equation (6.1) or its general solution (6.2) deÔ¨Ånes the
frame {ÀúeI} and the frame { ÀúXI} adapted to {ÀúeI} only on W and leaves them
completely arbitrary on V \ W, if it is not empty.
Proposition 6.1. Let {XI} be the frame adapted to a frame {eI} in T (V ) ‚äÜT (E)
deÔ¨Åned over an open set V ‚äÜE and Œìa
¬µ be the coeÔ¨Écients of a connection ‚àÜh
in {XI}. Then all frames { ÀúXI}, normal on W ‚äÜV for the connection ‚àÜh, are
adapted to frames {ÀúeI} given on W by
Àúe¬µ|W = (AŒΩ
¬µ(eŒΩ + Œìb
ŒΩeb))|W
Àúea|W = (Ab
aeb)|W .
(6.3)
where [AŒΩ
¬µ] and [Ab
a] are non-degenerate matrix-valued functions on V which are
constant on the Ô¨Åbres of (E, œÄ, M). Moreover, the frame { ÀúXI} adapted on V to
{ÀúeI}, given by (6.3) (and hence normal on W), is such that
ÀúX¬µ|W = (AŒΩ
¬µXŒΩ)|W = Àúe¬µ|W
ÀúXa|W = (Ab
aXb)|W = Àúea|W ,
(6.4)
Proof. Apply (5.16), (5.15), and (5.13a) for the choice (6.2).
‚ñ°
The equations (6.4) are not accidental as it is stated by the following asser-
tion.

6. Normal frames
377
Proposition 6.2. The frame { ÀúXI} in T (E) adapted to a frame {ÀúeI} in T (E) and
deÔ¨Åned over an open set V ‚äÜE is normal on W ‚äÜV if and only if on W is
fulÔ¨Ålled
ÀúXI|W = ÀúeI|W .
(6.5)
Proof. Apply (5.13a) or (5.16) and DeÔ¨Ånition 6.1.
‚ñ°
Thus one can equivalently deÔ¨Åne the normal frames as adapted frames that
coincide on some set with the frames they are adapted to or as frames (in the
tangent bundles space over the bundle space) that coincide on some set with the
frames adapted to them.
Since any specialized frame is adapted to itself (see DeÔ¨Ånition 5.1 and (5.12),
with DJ
I = Œ¥J
I ), the sets of normal, specialized, and adapted frames are identical.
As we see from Proposition 6.1, which gives a complete description of the
normal frames, the theory of normal frames in the most general setting is trivial.
It becomes more interesting and richer if the class of frames {eI}, with respect to
which are deÔ¨Åned the adapted frames, is restricted in one or other way. To the
theory of normal frames, adapted to such restricted classes of frames in T (E), is
devoted the rest of this section.
6.2.
Normal frames adapted to holonomic frames
The class of holonomic frames induced by local coordinates on E (see Subsec-
tion 3.2) is the most natural class of frames in T (E) relative to which the adapted,
in particular normal, frames are deÔ¨Åned. To specify the consideration of the previ-
ous subsection to normal frames adapted to local coordinates on E, we set eI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI
and ÀúeI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI , where {uI} and {ÀúuI} are local coordinate systems on E whose
domains have a non-empty intersection V and W ‚äÜV . Then the matrix [AJ
I ]
in (6.1) is given by (3.3) (as {eI} ‚Üí{ÀúeI} reduces to (3.2a)), so that the normal
frame equation (6.1) reduces to the normal coordinates equation (see also (3.32))

due to (3.1), which is a Ô¨Årst-order system of nr linear partial diÔ¨Äerential equations

Since the connection ‚àÜh is supposed given and Ô¨Åxed, such are its coeÔ¨Écients

. Therefore the existence, uniqueness and other properties of the so-
lutions of (6.6) strongly depend on the set W (which is in the intersection of the
domains of the local coordinates {uI} and {ÀúuI} on E).
Proposition 6.3. If the normal frame equation (6.6) has solutions, then all frames
{ ÀúXI} normal on W ‚äÜE and adapted to local coordinates, deÔ¨Åned on an open set
V ‚äÜE such that V ‚äáW, are described by

where {XI} is the frame adapted to some arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed local coordinates {uI},
deÔ¨Åned on an open set containing or equal to V , {ÀúuI} are local coordinates with do-
main V and such that Àúua are solutions of (6.6), and AJ
I = ‚àÇuJ
‚àÇÀúuI on the intersection
of the domains of {uI} and {ÀúuI}.
Proof. Apply Proposition 6.1 for eI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI and ÀúeI =
‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI and then use (3.2a)
and (3.3).
‚ñ°
This simple result gives a complete description of all normal frames, if any,
adapted to (local) holonomic frames. It should be understood clearly, normal on
W is the frame { ÀúXI}, adapted to

‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI

and coinciding with it on W, but not
the frame

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI

; in particular, the frame

‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI

is holonomic while the frame
{ ÀúXI} need not to be holonomic, even on W, if the connection considered does not
satisÔ¨Åes some additional conditions, like the vanishment of its curvature on W.
Consider now brieÔ¨Çy the existence problem for the solutions of (6.6). To
begin with, we emphasize that in (6.6) enter only the Ô¨Åbre coordinates Àúua, so that
it leaves the basic ones Àúu¬µ completely arbitrary.
Proposition 6.4. If E is of class C2, p ‚ààE is Ô¨Åxed and W = {p}, then the general
solution of (6.6) is
Àúua(q) = ga + ga
b {‚àíŒìb
¬µ(p)(q¬µ ‚àíp¬µ) + (qb ‚àípb)} + f a
IJ(q)(qI ‚àípI)(qJ ‚àípJ), (6.8)
where ga and ga
b are constants in K = R, C, det[ga
b ] Ã∏= 0, ‚àû, the point q is in the
domain V of {uI}, qI := uI(q), pI := uI(p), and f a
IJ are C2 functions on V such
that they and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded when qI ‚ÜípI.
Proof. Expand Àúua(q) = f a(u1(q), . . . , un(q), . . . , un+r(q)) = f a(q1, . . . , qn+r) into
a Taylor Ô¨Årst order polynomial with remainder term quadratic in (qI ‚àípI) and
insert the result into (6.6). In this way one gets (6.8) with ga = Àúua(p) and ga
b =
‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇub
		
p.
‚ñ°
Now we would like to investigate the existence of solutions of (6.6) along
paths Œ≤ : J ‚ÜíE, i.e., for W = Œ≤(J). The main result is formulated below as
Proposition 6.5 and for its proof we shall essentially use Lemma II.3.1.
Proposition 6.5. Let ‚àÜh be a C1 connection on a real C3 bundle (E, œÄ, M), n =
dim M ‚â•1, and r = dim œÄ‚àí1(x) ‚â•1 for x ‚ààM. Let Œ≤ : J ‚ÜíE be an injective
regular C1 path such that its tangent vector ÀôŒ≤(s) at s is not a vertical vector for all
s ‚ààJ, ÀôŒ≤(s) Ã∏‚àà‚àÜv
Œ≤(s); in particular, the path Œ≤ can be horizontal, i.e., ÀôŒ≤(s) ‚àà‚àÜh
Œ≤(s)
for all s ‚ààJ, but generally the vector ÀôŒ≤(s) can have also and a vertical component
for some or all s ‚ààJ. Then, for every s0 ‚ààJ, there exist a neighborhood W1 of the
point Œ≤(s0) in E and bundle coordinates ÀúuI on W1 which are solutions of (6.6) for
W = W1 ‚à©Œ≤(J) = Œ≤(J1), with J1 := {s ‚ààJ : Œ≤(s) ‚ààW1}, i.e., along the restricted
path Œ≤|J1. All such bundle coordinates ÀúuI are given via the equation (6.9) below.

6. Normal frames
379
Proof. Consider the chart (W1, u) with W1 ‚àãŒ≤(s0) provided by Lemma II.3.1 for
E and Œ≤ instead of M and Œ≥, respectively. For any p ‚ààW1, there is a unique
(s, t) ‚ààJ1 √ó RdimR E‚àí1 such that p = u‚àí1(s, t), i.e., in the coordinate system {uI}
associated to u, the coordinates of p are u1(p) = s and uI(p) = tI ‚ààR for I ‚â•2.
Besides, we have u(Œ≤(s)) = (s, t0) for all s ‚ààJ1 and some Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààRdimR E‚àí1.
Since ÀôŒ≤(s) is not a vertical vector for all s ‚ààJ, the coordinate system
{uI} can be chosen to be bundle coordinate system. For the purpose, in the
proof of Lemma II.3.1 one must choose {yI} as bundle coordinate system and
to take for ÀôŒ≤1
y(s0) any non-vanishing component between ÀôŒ≤1
y(s0), . . . , ÀôŒ≤n
y (s0), viz.
if ÀôŒ≤1
y(s0) Ã∏= 0 the proof goes as it is written and, if ÀôŒ≤1
y(s0) = 0, choose some ¬µ0
such that ÀôŒ≤¬µ0
y (s0) Ã∏= 0 and make, e.g., the change ÀôŒ≤1
y(s0) ‚ÜîÀôŒ≤¬µ0
y (s0). This, together
with (II.3.12), with uI for xk, ensures that {yI} ‚Üí{uI} is an admissible change,
so that {uI} are bundle coordinates if the initial coordinates {yI} are such ones.
Let {uI} be so constructed bundle coordinates and Œ∑ := u‚àí1, so that Œ≤(s) =
Œ∑(s, t0). Expanding Àúua(Œ∑(s, t)) into a Ô¨Årst-order Taylor polynomial at the point
t0 ‚ààK, we Ô¨Ånd the general solution of (6.6), with W = Œ≤(J1) = W1 ‚à©Œ≤(J), in the
form
Àúua(Œ∑(s, t)) = Ba(s)
+ Ba
b (s){‚àíŒìb
¬µ(Œ≤(s))[u¬µ(Œ∑(s, t)) ‚àíu¬µ(Œ≤(s))] + [ub(Œ∑(s, t)) ‚àíub(Œ≤(s))]}
+ Ba
IJ(s, t; Œ∑)[uI(Œ∑(s, t)) ‚àíuI(Œ≤(s))][uJ(Œ∑(s, t)) ‚àíuJ(Œ≤(s))],
(6.9)
where Ba, Ba
b : J1 ‚ÜíK = R, det[Ba
b ] Ã∏= 0, ‚àû, and the C1 functions Ba
IJ and their
Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded when t ‚Üít0. (Notice, the terms with ¬µ = 1
and/or I = 1 and/or J = 1 do not contribute in (6.9) as u1(Œ∑(s, t)) ‚â°s and,
besides, the functions Ba
IJ can be taken symmetric in I and J, Ba
IJ = Ba
JI.)
‚ñ°
Remark 6.1. If there is s0 ‚ààJ for which ÀôŒ≤(s0) is a vertical vector, ÀôŒ≤(s0) ‚àà‚àÜv
Œ≤(s0),
then Proposition 6.5 remains true with the only correction that the coordinates ÀúuI
will not be bundle coordinates. If this is the case, the constructed coordinates ÀúuI
will be solutions of (6.6), but we cannot assert that they are bundle coordinates
which are (locally) normal along Œ≤ in a neighborhood of the point Œ≤(s0).
Proposition 6.5 can be generalized by requiring Œ≤ to be locally injective in-
stead of injective, i.e., for each s ‚ààJ to exist a subinterval Js ‚äÜJ such that
Js ‚àãs and the restricted path Œ≤|Js to be injective. Besides, if one needs a ver-
sion of the above results for complex bundles, they should be considered as real
ones (with doubled dimension of the manifolds) for which are applicable the above
considerations.
Corollary 6.1. At any arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed point in E and/or along a given injective
regular C1 path in E, whose tangent vector is not vertical, there exist (possibly
local, in the latter case) normal frames.

380
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
Proof. See DeÔ¨Ånition 6.1, Propositions 6.4 and 6.5, and equation (6.6). If the path
is not contained in a single coordinate neighborhood, one should cover its image
in the bundle space with such neighborhoods and, then, to apply Proposition 6.5;
in the intersection of the coordinate domains, the uniqueness (and, possibly, con-
tinuity or diÔ¨Äerentiability) of the normal frames may be lost.
‚ñ°
DeÔ¨Ånition 6.2. Local bundle coordinates {ÀúuI}, deÔ¨Åned on an open set V ‚äÜE,
will be called normal on W ‚äÜV for a connection ‚àÜh if the frame { ÀúXI} in T (E)
adapted to

 ‚àÇ
‚àÇÀúuI

over V is normal for ‚àÜh on W.
Corollary 6.1 implies the existence of coordinates normal at a given point or
(locally) along a given injective path whose tangent vector is not vertical; in partic-
ular, there exist coordinates normal along an injective horizontal path. However,
normal coordinates generally do not exist on more general subsets of the bundle
space E. A criterion for existence of coordinates normal on suÔ¨Éciently general sub-
sets W ‚äÜE, e.g on ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô submanifolds, is given by Theorem 7.1 in Section 7
below. In particular, we have the following result.
Proposition 6.6. If ‚àÜh is a C1 connection, W is an open set in E, and normal
frames for ‚àÜh on W exist, then there are holonomic such frames if ‚àÜh is Ô¨Çat on
W. Said otherwise, the system of equations (6.6) may admit solutions on an open
set W if
Ra
¬µŒΩ|W = 0
(6.10)
where Ra
¬µŒΩ are the Ô¨Åbre components of the curvature of ‚àÜh in some frame on E,
deÔ¨Åned by (3.37a) in the frame {XI} adapted to a holonomic one.
Proof. Since the normal frames are also adapted ones (see DeÔ¨Ånition 6.1) and
Œìa
¬µ|W = 0 in a frame normal on W, the statement is a corollary from Proposi-
tion 3.4.
‚ñ°
Remark 6.2. However, in the general case the Ô¨Çatness of a connection on an open
set is only a necessary, but not suÔ¨Écient, condition for the existence of coordinates
normal on that set ‚Äì see Theorem 7.1 in Section 7 below. Exceptions are the linear
connections on vector bundles ‚Äì see Remark 7.1 in Section 7.
Exercise 6.1. Show that part of the integrability conditions for (6.6) for an open
set W are
0 =

‚àÇ2Àúua
‚àÇu¬µ‚àÇuŒΩ ‚â°‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇub Rb
¬µŒΩ
(6.11)
from where Proposition 6.6 immediately follows. However, the Ô¨Çatness of the con-
nection on W generally does not imply the rest of the integrability conditions, viz.
‚àÇ2 Àúua
‚àÇub‚àÇu¬µ ‚àí
‚àÇ2 Àúua
‚àÇu¬µ‚àÇub = 0 and
‚àÇ2 Àúua
‚àÇub‚àÇuc ‚àí
‚àÇ2 Àúua
‚àÇuc‚àÇub = 0.
The combination of Propositions 6.6 and 6.2 implies the non-existence of
coordinates normal on an open set for non-Ô¨Çat (non-integrable) connections.

6.3.
Normal frames on vector bundles
The normal frames in vector bundles for covariant derivative operators (linear
connections), other derivations, and linear transports along paths were investigated
in Chapter IV. The goal of the present subsection is to be made a link between
them and the general theory of Subsection 6.1.
Consider a linear connection ‚àÜh on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) (see DeÔ¨Åni-
tion 4.1). Let the frame {eI} in T (E) be given by (5.32) and {XI} be the frame
adapted to {eI} for ‚àÜh. Then, by Proposition 5.4, the 2- and 3-index coeÔ¨Écients
of ‚àÜh are connected via (5.33) in which {ua} is vector Ô¨Åbre coordinate system.
Proposition 6.7. A frame {XI} is normal on W ‚äÜE for a linear connection ‚àÜh
if and only if in it vanish the 3-index coeÔ¨Écients of ‚àÜh on œÄ(W) ‚äÜM,
Œìa
¬µ|W = 0 ‚áê‚áíŒìa
b¬µ|œÄ(W) = 0.
(6.12)
Proof. Since un+1, . . . , un+r are 1-forms which are linearly independent for all
p ‚ààW, the assertion follows from equation (5.33).
‚ñ°
Combining Proposition 6.7 with (5.35), we see that the normal frame equa-
tion (6.1) in vector bundle is equivalent to
(BŒΩ
¬µŒìa
bŒΩ + Ba
b¬µ)|œÄ(W) = 0
(6.13)
or to its matrix variant (see also (5.35‚Ä≤); ŒìŒΩ := [Œìa
bŒΩ], B¬µ := [Ba
b¬µ])
(BŒΩ
¬µŒìŒΩ + B¬µ)|œÄ(W) = 0.
(6.13‚Ä≤)
Taking into account (6.13) and (5.34), we can assert that the frame { ÀúXI} adapted
to the frame
(Àúe¬µ, Àúea) = (eŒΩ, eb) ¬∑
/
BŒΩ
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ
0
‚àí((BŒª
¬µŒìb
cŒª) ‚ó¶œÄ) ¬∑ uc
Bb
a ‚ó¶œÄ
0
,
(6.14)
where [BŒΩ
¬µ] and [Ba
b ] are non-degenerate matrix-valued functions, is normal on W
for ‚àÜh and hence ÀúXI = ÀúeI, by virtue of Proposition 6.2. Recall (see (5.15), (5.16),
and (5.31)), the change {eI} ‚Üí{ÀúeI}, given by (6.14), entails {XI} ‚Üí{ ÀúXI}, where
ÀúX¬µ = (BŒΩ
¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ)XŒΩ
ÀúXa = (Bb
a ‚ó¶œÄ)Xb,
(6.15)
which is equivalent to {EI} ‚Üí{ ÀúEI} with
ÀúE¬µ = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ
ÀúEa = Bb
aEb.
(6.16)
Here (see (5.26)) {E¬µ = œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh(X¬µ)} is a frame in T (M) and {Ea = v‚àí1(Xa)} is
a frame in E.

382
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
Thus, if additional restriction are not imposed, the theory of normal frames in
vector bundles is rather trivial, which reÔ¨Çects a similar situation in general bundles,
considered in Subsection 6.1. However, the really interesting and sensible case is
when one considers frames compatible with the covariant derivatives (see Section 5,
the paragraphs including equations (5.38)‚Äì(5.40)). As we know (see (5.36)), it
corresponds to arbitrary non-degenerate matrix-valued functions [BŒΩ
¬µ] and B =
[Ba
b ] and a matrix-valued functions B¬µ = [BŒΩ
b¬µ] given by
B¬µ = ÀúE¬µ(B) ¬∑ B‚àí1 = BŒΩ
¬µEŒΩ(B) ¬∑ B‚àí1.
(6.17)
In particular, such are all holonomic frames in T (E), locally induced by local
coordinates on E, as discussed in Section 4. Now the normal frames equation (6.13)
(or (6.1)) reduces to
(Œì¬µ ¬∑ B + E¬µ(B))|œÄ(W) = 0
(6.18)
which is exactly the equation (IV.14.54) for N = M, g = idM and U = œÄ(W),
i.e., the normal frame equation for a linear connection in a vector bundle. This
equation leaves the frame { ÀúE¬µ = œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh(X¬µ)} in T (M) completely arbitrary and
imposes restriction on the frame { ÀúEa = v‚àí1(Xa) = Bb
aEb} in E. This conclusion
justiÔ¨Åes the following deÔ¨Ånition.
DeÔ¨Ånition 6.3. Given a linear connection ‚àÜh on a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) and a
subset WM ‚äÜM. A frame {Ea} in E, deÔ¨Åned over an open set VM containing WM
or equal to it, VM ‚äáWM, is called normal for ‚àÜh over/on WM if their is a frame
{XI} in T (E), deÔ¨Åned over an open set VE ‚äÜE, which is normal for ‚àÜh over a
subset WE ‚äÜE and such that œÄ(WE) = WM, œÄ(VE) = VM, and Ea = v‚àí1(Xa),
with the mapping v deÔ¨Åned by (4.3). Respectively, {Ea} is normal for ‚àÜh along a
mapping g: QM ‚ÜíM, QM Ã∏= ‚àÖ, if {Ea} is normal for ‚àÜh over g(QM).
Taking into account DeÔ¨Ånition 6.1, we see that the so-deÔ¨Åned normal frames
in the bundle space E are just the ones used in the theory of frames normal for
linear connections in vector bundles ‚Äì see DeÔ¨Ånition IV.14.15 for N = M and
g = idM.
It is quite clear, to any frame {XI} in T (E) normal over W ‚äÜE, there
corresponds a unique frame {Ea = v‚àí1(Xa)} in E normal over œÄ(W) ‚äÜM.
But, to a frame {Ea} in E normal over œÄ(W), there correspond inÔ¨Ånitely many
frames {XI} = {(œÄ‚àó|‚àÜh)‚àí1(E¬µ), v(Ea)} in T (E) normal over W, where {E¬µ}
is an arbitrary frame in T (M) over œÄ(W). Thus the problems of existence and
(un)uniqueness of normal frames in T (E) is completely reduced to the same prob-
lems for normal frames in E. The last kind of problems, as we noted at the begin-
ning of the present section, are known and were investigated in Chapter IV.
We emphasize that a normal frame {Ea} in E, as well as the basis {v(Ea)}
for ‚àÜv, can be holonomic as well as anholonomic (see Chapter IV); at the same
time, a normal frame {XI} in T (E) is anholonomic unless the conditions (5.25)
hold (Corollary 5.2), a necessary condition being the Ô¨Çatness (integrability) of the
horizontal distribution ‚àÜh.

7. Coordinates normal along injective mappings
383
Ending this section, let us say some words regarding frames normal for aÔ¨Éne
connections on vector bundles.
Proposition 6.8 (cf. Proposition 6.7). A frame {XI} is normal on U ‚äÜE for an
aÔ¨Éne connection ‚àÜh, with 2-index coeÔ¨Écients (5.45) on U, if and only if in it is
fulÔ¨Ålled
Œìa
b¬µ|œÄ(U) = 0
(6.19a)
Ga
¬µ|œÄ(U) = 0.
(6.19b)
Proof. The assertion follows from DeÔ¨Ånition 6.1, equation (5.45), and the linear
independence of the vector Ô¨Åbre coordinates un+1, . . . , un+r, considered as 1-forms.
‚ñ°
Corollary 6.2. A necessary condition for existence of frames normal on U ‚äÜE for
an aÔ¨Éne connection is
Ga
¬µ|œÄ(U) = 0
(6.20)
in all adapted frames on U; in particular, (6.20) is equivalent to G|(œÄ(U)) = 0 if U
is an open set.
Proof. Use (6.19b) and (5.47b).
‚ñ°
Corollary 6.3. A necessary condition for existence of frames normal on U ‚äÜE for
an aÔ¨Éne connection is
Œìa
¬µ|U = ‚àí{(Œìa
b¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ) ¬∑ ub}|U
(6.21)
in all adapted frames on U; in particular, if U is an open set, then (6.21) means
that the restriction of the connection considered on (U, œÄ|U, œÄ(U)) is a linear con-
nection.
Proof. Apply Proposition 6.8 and Corollary 6.2.
‚ñ°
Corollary 6.4. If an aÔ¨Éne connection admits frames normal on U ‚äÜE, then all
of them are normal on U for the linear connection, corresponding to it via the
mapping Œ± constructed in the proof of Proposition 4.7, and vice versa.
Proof. Use Corollary 6.3 and Proposition 6.7.
‚ñ°
Thus, if the condition (6.20) is satisÔ¨Åed, the above results completely reduce
the problems of existence, (un)uniqueness and the properties of frames normal for
aÔ¨Éne connections to the same problems for linear connections (that correspond
to them).

Coordinates normal along injective mappings with
non-vanishing horizontal component
The purpose of this section is a multi-dimensional generalization of Proposition 6.5
in the real case, K = R. It is formulated below as Theorem 7.1. For its proof we
shall essentially need Lemma III.8.1 on page 163.
Let (E, œÄ, M) be a C3 bundle endowed with C1 connection ‚àÜh. Let k ‚ààN,
k ‚â§dim M, and Jk be an open set in Rk. Consider a C2 regular injective mapping
Œ≤ : Jk ‚ÜíE such that the vector Ô¨Åelds ÀôŒ≤Œ± : s ‚ÜíÀôŒ≤Œ±(s) :=
‚àÇŒ≤I(s)
‚àÇsŒ±
‚àÇ
‚àÇuI
		
Œ≤(s), with
s := (s1, . . . , sk) ‚ààJk and Œ± = 1, . . . , k, do not belong to the vertical distribution
‚àÜv, ÀôŒ≤Œ±(s) Ã∏‚àà‚àÜv
Œ≤(s) for all s ‚ààJk; in particular, the mapping Œ≤ can be a horizontal
mapping in a sense that ÀôŒ≤Œ±(s) ‚àà‚àÜh
Œ≤(s) for all s ‚ààJk, but generally these vectors
can have a vertical component too. Our aim is to Ô¨Ånd the integrability conditions
for the normal frame/coordinates equation (6.6) and its solutions, if any, when
U = Œ≤(Jk
1 ) for some subset Jk
1 ‚äÜJk.
Let us take some s0 ‚ààJk and construct the chart (U1, u) with U1 ‚àãŒ≤(s0)
provided by Lemma III.8.1 with E for M and Œ≤ for Œ≥. If Jk
1 := {s ‚ààJk : Œ≤(s) ‚ààU1}
and p ‚ààU1, then there is a unique (s, t) ‚ààJk
1 √óRdimR E‚àík such that p = Œ∑(s, t) with
Œ∑ := u‚àí1, i.e., uI(p) = sI for I = 1, . . . , k and uI(p) = tI for I = k + 1, . . . , n + r.
Besides, we have u(Œ≤(s)) = (s, t0) for all s ‚ààJk
1 and some Ô¨Åxed t0 ‚ààRdimR E‚àík.
Since the vector Ô¨Åelds ÀôŒ≤Œ±, Œ± = 1, . . . , k, are not vertical, we can construct the
coordinate system {uI}, associated to the chart (U1, u), so that they it be bundle
coordinate system on U1 (see the proof of Lemma III.8.1). Thus on U1 we have
bundle coordinates uI such that

u1(Œ∑(s, t)), . . . , un+r(Œ∑(s, t))

:= (s, t) ‚ààRn+r
s = (s1, . . . , sk) ‚ààJk
1
t = (tk+1, . . . , tn+r) ‚ààRn+r‚àík.
(7.1)
Let the indices Œ± and Œ≤ run from 1 to k and the indices œÉ and œÑ take the
values form k +1 to n; we set œÉ = œÑ = ‚àÖif k = n. Thus, we have uŒ±(Œ∑(s, t)) = sŒ±,
uœÉ(Œ∑(s, t)) = tœÉ, and ua(Œ∑(s, t)) = ta.
Proposition 7.1. Under the hypotheses made above, the normal frame/coordinates
equation (6.6) with U = Œ≤(Jk
1 ) = Œ≤(Jk)‚à©U1 has solutions if and only if the system

(7.3)
where s1 ‚ààJk
1 is arbitrarily Ô¨Åxed, Ba
b , with det[Ba
b ] Ã∏= 0, ‚àû, are solutions of (7.2),
and the functions f a
¬µŒΩ and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are bounded when t ‚Üít0.
Remark 7.1. As uŒ±(Œ∑(s, t)) = uŒ±(Œ≤(s)) ‚â°sŒ± for all Œ± = 1, . . . , k, the terms with
¬µ, ŒΩ = 1, . . . , k in (7.3) have vanishing contribution.
Remark 7.2. For k = 1, we have Œ± = Œ≤ = 1, due to which the equations (7.2) are
identically valid and Proposition 7.1 reduces to Proposition 6.5.
Proof. To begin with, we rewrite (6.6) as
‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇsŒ±
			
Œ≤(s) = ‚àí‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇtb
			
Œ≤(s)Œìb
Œ±(Œ≤(s))
‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇtœÉ
			
Œ≤(s) = ‚àí‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇtb
			
Œ≤(s)Œìb
œÉ(Œ≤(s)).
Introducing a non-degenerate matrix-valued function [Ba

1 by
Ba
b (s) = ‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇtb
			
Œ≤(s) = ‚àÇÀúua(s, t)
‚àÇtb
			
t=t0,
(7.4)
we see that (6.6) is equivalent to
‚àÇÀúua
‚àÇsŒ±
			
Œ≤(s) = ‚àíBa
b (s)Œìb
Œ±(Œ≤(s))
Œ± = 1, . . . , k

‚àÇtœÉ
			
Œ≤(s) = ‚àíBa
b (s)Œìb
œÉ(Œ≤(s))
œÉ = k + 1, . . . , n.
(7.5b)
Expanding Àúua(Œ∑(s, t)) into a Taylor polynomial up to second-order terms
relative to (t ‚àít0) about the point t0 and using (7.4) and (7.5), we get:
Àúua(Œ∑(s, t)) = f a(s) ‚àíBa
b (s)Œìb
œÉ(Œ≤(s))[tœÉ ‚àítœÉ

¬µŒΩ(s; t; Œ∑)[u¬µ(Œ∑(s, t)) ‚àíu¬µ(Œ≤(s))][uŒΩ(Œ∑(s, t)) ‚àíuŒΩ(Œ≤(s))],
(7.6)
where f a and f a
¬µŒΩ are C1 functions and f a
¬µŒΩ and their Ô¨Årst partial derivatives are
bounded when t ‚Üít0. The equation (7.5a) is the only condition that puts some

386

restrictions on f a and Ba
b (besides det[Ba
b ] Ã∏= 0, ‚àû). Inserting (7.6) into (7.5a) and
using that Œ≤(s) = Œ∑(s, t0), we obtain
‚àÇf a(s)
‚àÇsŒ±
= ‚àíBa
b (s)Œìb
Œ±(Œ≤(s)).
(7.7)
Thus the initial normal coordinates equation (6.6), with U = Œ≤(Jk
1 ), has solutions if
and only if there exist solutions of (7.7) relative to f a and/or Ba
b . The integrability
conditions for (7.7) are [34]

where (7.12) and (3.37a) were applied in the derivation of the second equality

Since the system of equations (7.13) always has solutions, e.g., Db
bŒ±(s) = 0,
we can assert that (7.12) and (7.14) are the integrability conditions for (7.2) and,
if (7.12) and (7.14) hold, every solution of (7.11), with Da
bŒ± satisfying (7.13), is a
solution of (7.2) and vice versa.
At the end, the only unproved assertion is that Da
bŒ± in (7.11) equals to ‚àÇŒ±(Da

with Da
b satisfying (7.10). Indeed, since Jk
1 is an open set and hence is contractible

and M are of class C3.

one, the Poincar¬¥e‚Äôs lemma (see [6, Section 6.3] or [5, pp. 21, 106]) implies the
existence of functions Da
b on Jk
1 such that Db
bŒ±(s) = ‚àÇŒ±(Da
b )(s), due to (7.13b);
inserting this result into (7.13a), we get (7.10).

Remark 7.3. Regardless that the conditions (7.8b) look quite special, they are
identically valid for connections with
Œìa
Œ± = ‚àí(Œìa
bŒ± ‚ó¶œÄ) ¬∑ ub + Ga
Œ± ‚ó¶œÄ,
(7.15)
where Œìa
bŒ± and Ga
Œ± are C2 functions on œÄ(Œ≤(Jk)), i.e., for aÔ¨Éne connections (see
Subsection 4.4). In particular, of this kind are the linear connections on vector
bundles ‚Äì see Proposition 5.4 and 5.5.
At last, we shall formulate the main result of the above considerations as a
combination of Proposition 7.1 and Lemma 7.1.
Theorem 7.1. Let (E, œÄ, M) be a C3 bundle endowed with a C2 connection. Under
the hypotheses made and notation introduced before Proposition 7.1, there exist
solutions of the normal frame/coordinates equation (6.6) if and only if the connec-
tion‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écients satisfy the equations (7.8). If these equations hold, all coordinates
normal on Œ≤(Jk
1 ) are given on U1 by (7.3), where Ba
b are solutions of (7.9), with
Da
b being solutions of (7.10).
Remark 7.4. If there are s0 ‚ààJk and Œ± ‚àà{1, . . . , k} such that the vector ÀôŒ≤Œ±(s0)
is a vertical vector, ÀôŒ≤Œ±(s0) ‚àà‚àÜv
Œ≤(s0), then Theorem 7.1 remains true with the only
correction that the coordinate system {uI} will not be bundle coordinate system.
If this is the case, the constructed coordinates ÀúuI will be solutions of (6.6), but we
cannot assert that they are bundle coordinates which are (locally) normal along
Œ≤ in a neighborhood of the point Œ≤(s0).
Theorem 7.1 provides a necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for the existence
of local coordinates in a neighborhood of Œ≤(s0) for any s0 ‚ààJk which are locally
normal along Œ≤, i.e., on Œ≤(Jk
1 ) for some open subset Jk
1 ‚äÜJk containing s0.
Moreover, if this condition is valid, the theorem describes locally all coordinates
normal along Œ≤.
Exercise 7.1. Prove that Theorem 7.1 remains valid by requiring Œ≤ to be locally
injective instead of injective, i.e., for each s ‚ààJ to exist subset Jk
s ‚äÜJk such that
Jk
s ‚àãs and the restricted mapping Œ≤|Jk
s to be injective.
If one needs a version of the above results for complex bundles, they should
be considered as real ones (with doubled dimension of the manifolds) for which
are applicable the above considerations.

Links between connections and
transports along paths in Ô¨Åbre bundles
As the title of this section indicates, its content is outside of the main topic of
the present book. It generalizes part of Section IV.14 and investigates relations
between some axiomatic approaches to the general theories of connections, parallel
transports, and transports along paths. We hope that the material below will
clarify some problems that may have arisen in Chapter IV and will be useful for
readers interested in the axiomatization of the concept of a ‚Äòparallel transport‚Äô.
The widespread approach to the concept of a ‚Äúparallel transport‚Äù is it to
be considered as a secondary one and deÔ¨Åned on the basis of the connection the-
ory [6,7,10‚Äì13,16,28,60,98,106,107,117,141‚Äì145]. However, the opposite approach,
in which the parallel transport is axiomatically deÔ¨Åned and from it the connec-
tion theory is constructed, is also known [17,23,30‚Äì33,91,147‚Äì150] and goes back
to 19491; e.g., it is systematically realized in [23], where the connection theory
on vector bundles is investigated. In [114] the concept of a ‚Äúparallel transport‚Äù
was generalize to the one of ‚Äútransport along paths‚Äù. The relations between both
concepts were analyzed in [115]; in particular, Theorem 3.1 of [115, p. 13] (see The-
orem 8.1 below) contains a necessary and suÔ¨Écient condition for a transport along
paths to be (axiomatically deÔ¨Åned) parallel transport. The aim of the present sec-
tion is to be investigated some links between general connections on Ô¨Åbre bundles
and transport along paths in them. Recall that similar problems, but in the linear
case in vector bundles, were explored in Section IV.14.
The bundle and base spaces of the bundles in this section are supposed to
be of diÔ¨Äerentiable of class C1; however, some parts of the text below, like DeÔ¨Åni-
tion 8.1, are valid in more general situations.
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.1. A transport along paths in bundle (E, œÄ, B) is a mapping I assigning
to every path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM a mapping IŒ≥, termed transport along Œ≥, such that
IŒ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíIŒ≥
s‚Üít where the mapping
IŒ≥
s‚Üít : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(t))
s, t ‚ààJ,
(8.1)
called transport along Œ≥ from s to t, has the properties:
IŒ≥
s‚Üít ‚ó¶IŒ≥
r‚Üís = IŒ≥
r‚Üít
r, s, t ‚ààJ
(8.2)
IŒ≥
s‚Üís = idœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s))
s ‚ààJ,
(8.3)
1It seems that the earliest written accounts on this approach are the ones due to ¬®U.G. Lu-
miste [30, Section 2.2] and C. Teleman [17, Chapter IV, Section B.3] (both published in 1964),
the next essential steps being made by P. Dombrowski [31, ¬ß 1] and W. Poor [23]. Besides, the
author of [31] states that his paper is based on unpublished lectures of prof. Willi Rinow (1907‚Äì
1979) in 1949; see also [23, p. 46] where the author claims that the Ô¨Årst axiomatical deÔ¨Ånition of
a parallel transport in the tangent bundle case is given by prof. W. Rinow in his lectures at the
Humboldt University in 1949. Some heuristic comments on the axiomatic approach to parallel
transport theory can be found in [8, Section 2.1] too.

Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
where ‚ó¶denotes composition of mappings and idX is the identity mapping of a
set X.
Remark 8.1. If (E, œÄ, M)) is a vector bundle and the mappings (8.1) are linear,
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.1 reduces to DeÔ¨Ånition IV.3.1.
An analysis and various comments on this deÔ¨Ånition can be found in [87,102,
114,115]; see also Section IV.3.
As we shall see below, an important special class of transports along paths
is selected by the conditions
IŒ≥|J‚Ä≤
s‚Üít = IŒ≥
s‚Üít
s, t ‚ààJ‚Ä≤
(8.4)
IŒ≥‚ó¶œá
s‚Üít = IŒ≥
œá(s)‚Üíœá(t)
s, t ‚ààJ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤,
(8.5)
where J‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ is a subinterval, Œ≥|J‚Ä≤ is the restriction of Œ≥ to J‚Ä≤, and œá: J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíJ is
a bijection of a real interval J‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ onto J.
Putting r = t in (8.2) and using (8.3), we see that the mappings (8.1) are
invertible and
(IŒ≥
s‚Üít)‚àí1 = IŒ≥
t‚Üís.
(8.6)
The following result describes how a transport along paths generates a con-
nection.
Proposition 8.1. Let I be a transport along paths in a bundle (E, œÄ, M). Let Œ≥ : J ‚Üí
M be a path and, for any s0 ‚ààJ and p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)), the lift ¬ØŒ≥s0,p : J ‚ÜíE of Œ≥
be deÔ¨Åned by
¬ØŒ≥s0,p(t) = IŒ≥
s0‚Üít(p)
t ‚ààJ.
(8.7)
Suppose that I is such that ¬ØŒ≥s0,p is a C1 path for every s0 and p and the condi-
tions (8.4) and (8.5) hold for all paths Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM. Then the distribution
‚àÜI : p ‚Üí‚àÜI
p :=
 d
dt
			
t=s0

¬ØŒ≥s0,p(t)

: Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is C1 and injective, s0 ‚ààJ, Œ≥(s0) = œÄ(p)

‚äÜTp(E),
(8.8)
with p ‚ààE, is a connection on (E, œÄ, M), i.e.,
‚àÜv
p ‚äï‚àÜI
p = Tp(E)
p ‚ààE,
(8.9)
with ‚àÜv being the vertical distribution on E, ‚àÜv
p = Tp(œÄ‚àí1(œÄ(p))).
Proof. Let {u¬µ = x¬µ ‚ó¶œÄ, ua} be bundle coordinate system on E, p be a point in
its domain, and ¬ØŒ≥ : J ‚ÜíE be a lift of Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, œÄ ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥ = Œ≥. Since œÄ‚àó

= ÀôŒ≥¬µ(t) for all t ‚ààJ, we have
œÄ‚àó(Àô¬ØŒ≥(t)) = ÀôŒ≥(t)
(8.10)

8. Links between connections and transports
391
for any lift ¬ØŒ≥ in E of a path Œ≥ in M. Therefore, from (8.8) and (8.10), we get
œÄ‚àó(‚àÜI
p) =

ÀôŒ≥(s0) : Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is C1 and injective, s0 ‚ààJ, Œ≥(s0) = œÄ(p)

= TœÄ(p)(M)
as ÀôŒ≥(s0) is an arbitrary vector in TœÄ(p)(M) = TŒ≥(s0)(M). Thus the mapping
œÄ‚àó|‚àÜIp : ‚àÜI
p ‚ÜíTœÄ(p)(M) is surjective. It is also linear, due to the deÔ¨Ånition of
a tangent mapping [7, Section 1.22]. At last, we shall prove that œÄ‚àó|‚àÜIp is injective,
from where it follows that œÄ‚àó|‚àÜIp is a vector space isomorphism for every p ‚ààE
which, in its turn, implies (8.9) as œÄ‚àó(‚àÜv
p) = 0œÄ(p) ‚ààTœÄ(p)(M).
If Gi ‚àà‚àÜI
p, i = 1, 2, then there exist paths Œ≥i : Ji ‚ÜíM such that Œ≥i(si) =
œÄ(p) for some si ‚ààJi and Gi = Àô¬ØŒ≥i;si,p, with i = 1, 2 and the lifted paths in
the right-hand side being given by (8.7). Then œÄ‚àó(Gi) = ÀôŒ≥i(si), due to (8.10).
Suppose that ÀôŒ≥1(s1) = ÀôŒ≥2(s2). Since Œ≥1(s1) = Œ≥2(s2) = œÄ(p), the last equality
entails s1 = s2, J1 ‚à©J2 Ã∏= ‚àÖ, and the existence of an interval J‚Ä≤ ‚äÜJ1 ‚à©J2 such
that s1 = s2 ‚ààJ‚Ä≤ and Œ≥1|J‚Ä≤ = Œ≥2|J‚Ä≤.2 Combining this result with (8.4), we get
G1 = G2, which means that œÄ‚àó|‚àÜIp : ‚àÜI
p ‚ÜíTœÄ(p)(M) is injective.
‚ñ°
Remark 8.2. The condition (8.5) was not used explicitly in the proof of Proposi-
tion 8.1, but it is important in the deÔ¨Ånition (8.8) of the connection ‚àÜI. Namely,
it ensures that, if X ‚àà‚àÜI
p, then Œ∫X ‚àà‚àÜI
p for all Œ∫ ‚ààK. Indeed, if X =
d
dt
		
t=s0(¬ØŒ≥s0,p(t)) for some path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM and œá: J‚Ä≤ ‚ÜíJ is a C1 diÔ¨Äeomor-
phism, the vector tangent to the path ¬ØŒ≤s‚Ä≤
0,p(t‚Ä≤) at s‚Ä≤
0 = œá‚àí1(s0), with Œ≤ = Œ≥ ‚ó¶œá, is
œá(s‚Ä≤
0)X, by virtue of (8.7) and (8.5). So that œá(s‚Ä≤
0)X ‚àà‚àÜI
p and the arbitrariness
of œá leads to Œ∫X ‚àà‚àÜI
p for all Œ∫ ‚ààK.
Remark 8.3. The role of the transport I along paths in Proposition 8.1 is on its
base to be constructed a lifting of the paths in M to paths in E with appropriate
properties. Namely, such a lifting should assign to a path Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM a unique
path ¬ØŒ≥s0,p : J ‚ÜíE passing through a given point p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)), for some s0 ‚ààJ,
and such that œÄ ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥s0,p = Œ≥ and, if q ‚àà¬ØŒ≥s0,p(t0) for some t0 ‚ààJ, then ¬ØŒ≥t0,q = ¬ØŒ≥s0,p.
On this ground one can generalize Proposition 8.1 as well as some of the next
considerations and results.
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.2. The connection ‚àÜI, deÔ¨Åned in Proposition 8.1, will be called as-
signed to (deÔ¨Åned by, generated by) the transport I along paths.
For the further exploration of the relations between transports along paths
and connections (or parallel transports generated by them), we shall need the
notion of an inverse path and of a product of paths. There are not ‚Äònatural‚Äô deÔ¨Åni-
tions of these concepts, but this is not important for us as the (parallel) transports
we shall consider below are parametrization invariant in some sense, like (8.5).
2Here we use the local existence of a unique C1 path passing trough a given point and having
a Ô¨Åxed tangent vector at it.

392
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
For that reason, the concepts mentioned will be deÔ¨Åned only for canonical paths
[0, 1] ‚ÜíM, whose domain is the real interval [0, 1] := {r ‚ààR : 0 ‚â§r ‚â§1}. The
path inverse to Œ≥ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM is Œ≥ := Œ≥ ‚ó¶œÑ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM, with œÑ : [0, 1] ‚Üí[0, 1]
being given by œÑ (t) := 1 ‚àít for t ‚àà[0, 1]. If Œ≥1, Œ≥2 : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM and Œ≥1(1) = Œ≥2(0),
the product Œ≥1Œ≥2 of Œ≥1 and Œ≥2 is a canonical path Œ≥1Œ≥2 : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM such that
(Œ≥1Œ≥2)(t) := Œ≥1(2t) for t ‚àà[0, 1/2] and (Œ≥1Œ≥2)(t) := Œ≥2(2t ‚àí1) for t ‚àà[1/2, 1]. For
more details on this item, see [108,132].
Recall now the basic properties of the parallel transports generated by con-
nections.
Proposition 8.2. Let
P: Œ≥ ‚ÜíPŒ≥ : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÑ))
Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM
(8.11)
be the parallel transport generated by a connection on some bundle (E, œÄ, M). The
mapping P has the following properties:
(i) The parallel transport P is invariant under orientation preserving changes of
the paths‚Äô parameters. Precisely, if Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM and œá: [œÉ‚Ä≤, œÑ‚Ä≤] ‚Üí[œÉ, œÑ] is
an orientation preserving C1 diÔ¨Äeomorphism, then
PŒ≥‚ó¶œá = PŒ≥.
(8.12)
(ii) If Œ≥ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM and Œ≥ : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM is its canonical inverse, Œ≥ (t) = Œ≥(1 ‚àít)
for t ‚àà[0, 1], then
PŒ≥ =

PŒ≥‚àí1.
(8.13)
(iii) If Œ≥1, Œ≥2 : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM, Œ≥1(1) = Œ≥2(0), and Œ≥1Œ≥2 : [0, 1] ‚ÜíM is their canonical
product, then
PŒ≥1Œ≥2 = PŒ≥2 ‚ó¶PŒ≥1.
(8.14)
(iv) If Œ≥r,x : {r} = [r, r] ‚Üí{x} for some given r ‚ààR and x ‚ààM, then
PŒ≥r,x = idœÄ‚àí1(x).
(8.15)
Remark 8.4. As a result of (8.12), some properties of the parallel transports gener-
ated by connections, like (8.13) and (8.14), are suÔ¨Écient to be formulated/proved
only for canonical paths [0, 1] ‚ÜíM.
Proof. The proofs of (8.12)‚Äì(8.15) can be found in a number of works, for ex-
ample in [3, 4, 6, 11, 30, 32, 33, 148, 149, 154]. Alternatively, the reader can prove
them by applying the deÔ¨Ånitions given in this book. (See also Subsections IV.14.1
and IV.14.2 in a case of a vector bundle.)
‚ñ°
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.3 (cf. DeÔ¨Ånition IV.14.11 on page 313). A mapping (8.11) satisfying
the equalities (8.12)‚Äì(8.15) will be called (axiomatically deÔ¨Åned) parallel transport.

8. Links between connections and transports
393
Proposition 8.3. Let P be the parallel transport assigned to a Cm, with m ‚ààN‚à™{0},
connection on a smooth, of class Cm+1, bundle (E, œÄ, M). Then P is smooth, of
class Cm, in a sense that, if Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM is a C1 path, then PŒ≥ is in the set of
Cm diÔ¨Äeomorphisms between the Ô¨Åbres œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)) and œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÑ)),
P: Œ≥ ‚ÜíPŒ≥ ‚ààDiÔ¨Äm
œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)), œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÑ))

Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM.
(8.16)
Proof. See [16,106,107].
‚ñ°
The axiomatic approach to parallel transport was developed mainly on the
ground on the properties (8.12)‚Äì(8.16) of the parallel transports assigned to con-
nections. However, this topic is out of the range of the present monograph and the
reader is referred to the literature cited at the beginning of the present section.
Ending with the results we take for granted, we reproduce below a slightly
modiÔ¨Åed version of [115, p. 13, Theorem 3.1].
Theorem 8.1. Let I be a transport along paths in bundle (E, œÄ, M) and Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚Üí
M. If I satisÔ¨Åes the conditions (8.4) and (8.5), then the mapping
I: Œ≥ ‚ÜíIŒ≥ := IŒ≥
œÉ‚ÜíœÑ : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÑ))
Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM
(8.17)
is a parallel transport, i.e., it possess the properties (8.12)‚Äì(8.15), with I for P.
Besides, if I is smooth in a sense that
IŒ≤
s‚Üít ‚ààDiÔ¨Äm
œÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(s)), œÄ‚àí1(Œ≤(t))

Œ≤ : J ‚ÜíM
s, t ‚ààJ
(8.18)
for some m ‚ààN ‚à™{0}, then the mapping (8.17) satisÔ¨Åes (8.16), with I for P.

I. Besides, under the same assumptions, the condition (8.16) for P implies (8.18),

Remark 8.5. Instead by (8.20), the transport P along paths generated by a parallel
transport P can be deÔ¨Åned equivalently as follows. For a path Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM and

DeÔ¨Ånition 8.4. A transport I along paths which has the properties (8.4) and (8.5)
will be called parallel transport along paths.
Theorem 8.1 simply says that there is a bijective correspondence between the
parallel transports along paths and the parallel transports.
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.5. If I is a parallel transport along paths, then we say that the parallel
transport (8.17) is generated by (deÔ¨Åned by, assigned to) I. Respectively, if P is a
parallel transport, then we say that the (parallel) transport along paths (8.20) is
generated by (deÔ¨Åned by, assigned to) P.
Let us now return to the connection ‚àÜI generated by a transport I along
paths, introduced in Proposition 8.1.
Proposition 8.4. If Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM is an injective path and p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(s0)) for some
s0 ‚ààJ, then there is a unique ‚àÜI-horizontal lift of Œ≥ (relative to ‚àÜI) in E through
p and it is exactly the path ¬ØŒ≥s0,p deÔ¨Åned by (8.7).
Proof. Simply apply the deÔ¨Ånitions (8.7) and (8.8) and use the properties (8.1)
and (8.2) of the transports along paths (t0 ‚ààJ):
Àô¬ØŒ≥s0,p(t0) = d

Remark 8.6. If Œ≥ is not injective and Œ≥(s0) = Œ≥(t0) for some s0, t0 ‚ààJ such
that s0 Ã∏= t0, then the paths ¬ØŒ≥s0,p, ¬ØŒ≥t0,p : J ‚ÜíE need not to coincide as ¬ØŒ≥s0,p =

It0‚Üís0 ‚ó¶¬ØŒ≥t0,p, due to (8.7) and (8.2). Therefore the ‚àÜI-horizontal lift of a non-
injective path through a point in E lying in a Ô¨Åbre over a self-intersection point
of the path, if any, may not be unique. Similar is the situation for an arbitrary
connection. (This range of problems is connected with the so-called holonomy
groups.)
Proposition 8.5. The parallel transport I generated by the connection, deÔ¨Åned by a
transport along paths I, is such that
IŒ≥ = IŒ≥
œÉ‚ÜíœÑ
for Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM.
(8.23)
Proof. According to DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2 and (8.7), we have:
I: Œ≥ ‚ÜíIŒ≥ : œÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)) ‚ÜíœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÑ))
Œ≥ : [œÉ, œÑ] ‚ÜíM
IŒ≥ : p ‚ÜíIŒ≥(p) = ¬ØŒ≥œÉ,p(œÑ) = IŒ≥
œÉ‚ÜíœÑ(p)
p ‚ààœÄ‚àí1(Œ≥(œÉ)).
‚ñ°
Corollary 8.1. The parallel transport I generated by the connection ‚àÜI, assigned
to a transport I along paths, is a parallel transport, i.e., it satisÔ¨Åes (8.12)‚Äì(8.15)
with I for P.
Proof. This result is a particular case of Proposition 8.2. An alternative proof can
be carried out by using (8.1)‚Äì(8.7), (8.23), and the deÔ¨Ånitions of inverse path and
product of paths. The assertion is also a consequence of (8.23) and Theorem 8.1.
‚ñ°
Until this point, we have studied how a transport along paths generates a
connection (Proposition 8.1) and parallel transport (Proposition 8.5). Besides,
Theorem 8.1 establishes a bijective correspondence between particular class of
transports along paths and mappings having (some of) the main properties of the
parallel transports generated by connections. Below we shall pay attention, in a
sense, to the opposite links, starting from a connection on a bundle.
Proposition 8.6. Let P be the parallel transport assigned to a connection ‚àÜh on a
bundle (E, œÄ, M). The mapping
P : Œ≥ ‚ÜíP Œ≥ : (s, t) ‚ÜíP Œ≥
s‚Üít
Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM
(8.24a)


PŒ≥|[s,t]
for s ‚â§t

PŒ≥|[t,s]‚àí1
for s ‚â•t
(8.24b)
is a transport along paths in (E, œÄ, M). Moreover, P is parallel transport along
paths, i.e., it satisÔ¨Åes the equations (8.4) and (8.5) with P for I.
Proof. One should check the conditions (8.1)‚Äì(8.5) with P for I. The relations
(8.1) and (8.2) follow directly from DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2 of a parallel transport generated
by a connection. The rest conditions are consequences of (8.24) and a simple,

396
Chapter V. Normal Frames for Connections on Bundles
but tedious, application of the properties (8.12)‚Äì(8.14) of the parallel transports.
Alternatively, this proposition is a consequence of the second part of Theorem 8.1
and Remark 8.5.
‚ñ°
Remark 8.7. Applying (8.12)‚Äì(8.14), the reader can verify that
P Œ≥
s‚Üít = F ‚àí1(t; Œ≥) ‚ó¶F(s; Œ≥)
(8.25)
with
F(r; Œ≥) =

PŒ≥|[r,w]
for r ‚â§w

PŒ≥|[w,r]‚àí1
for r ‚â•w
r = s, t
(8.26)
for any (arbitrarily) Ô¨Åxed w ‚ààJ. This result is a special case of the general
structure of the transports along paths [114, Theorem 3.1].
DeÔ¨Ånition 8.6. The parallel transport along paths, deÔ¨Åned by a connection ‚àÜh
on a bundle through Proposition 8.6, will be called parallel transport along paths
assigned to (deÔ¨Åned by, generated by) the connection ‚àÜh.
Corollary 8.2. Let ‚àÜI be the connection generated by a parallel transport I along
paths according to Proposition 8.1. If I is the parallel transport assigned to ‚àÜI, then
the transport along paths assigned to I (or ‚àÜI), as described in Proposition 8.6,
coincides with the initial transport I along paths.
Proof. Substitute (8.23) into (8.24), with I for P and I for P.
‚ñ°
Corollary 8.3. Let P be the transport along paths assigned to a connection ‚àÜh (via
its parallel transport P) according to Proposition 8.6. The connection ‚àÜP generated
by P, as described in Proposition 8.1, coincides with the initial connection ‚àÜh,
‚àÜP = ‚àÜh.
Proof. On one hand, if p ‚ààE, the space ‚àÜP
p consists of the vectors tangent at s0
to the paths ¬ØŒ≥s0,p : t ‚ÜíP Œ≥
s0‚Üít(p), with Œ≥ : J ‚ÜíM, s0 ‚ààJ, and œÄ(p) = Œ≥(s0), due
to Proposition 8.1. On another hand, ‚àÜh
p consists of the vectors tangent at s0 to
the paths ÀúŒ≥s0,p : t ‚ÜíPŒ≥|[s0,t](p), by virtue of DeÔ¨Ånition 3.2. Equation (8.24b) says
that both types of paths coincide, ÀúŒ≥s0,p = ¬ØŒ≥s0,p, so that their tangent vectors at
t = s0 are identical and, consequently, ‚àÜP
p and ‚àÜh
p are equal as sets, ‚àÜP
p = ‚àÜh
p,
for all p ‚ààE.
‚ñ°
Roughly speaking, the above series of results says that a connection ‚àÜh is
equivalent to a mapping P (the assigned to it parallel transport) satisfying (8.11)‚Äì
(8.15) or to a mapping P (the assigned to it parallel transport along paths) sat-
isfying (8.1)‚Äì(8.5) (with P for I). Besides, the smoothness of ‚àÜh is equivalent to
the one of P or P. Let us summarize these results as follows.
Theorem 8.2. Given a connection ‚àÜh on a bundle (E, œÄ, M), there exists a unique
parallel transport I along paths in (E, œÄ, M) which generates ‚àÜh via (8.8), i.e.,
‚àÜI = ‚àÜh. Besides, the parallel transport P deÔ¨Åned by ‚àÜh is given by (8.17), i.e.,
P = I.

8. Links between connections and transports
397
Proof. See Propositions 8.1 and 8.5 and Theorem 8.1.
‚ñ°
Theorem 8.3. Given a parallel transport I along paths in a bundle (E, œÄ, M), then
there exists a unique connection ‚àÜh on (E, œÄ, M) such that the parallel transport
P along paths assigned to ‚àÜh coincides with I, P = I. Besides, the connection ‚àÜI
generated by I is identical with ‚àÜh, ‚àÜI = ‚àÜh.
Proof. Apply Proposition 8.1 and corollaries 8.2 and 8.3.
‚ñ°
Theorem 8.4. Given a parallel transport along paths in a bundle, there is a unique
(axiomatically deÔ¨Åned) parallel transport generating it. Conversely, given a parallel
transport, there is a unique parallel transport along paths generating it.
Proof. This statement is a reformulation of Theorem 8.1.
‚ñ°
Theorem 8.5. Given a parallel transport P, there exists a unique connection ‚àÜh
generating it. Besides, the parallel transport assigned to ‚àÜh coincides with P.
Proof. See Theorems 8.4 and 8.3 and DeÔ¨Ånitions 3.2 and 8.5.
‚ñ°
Theorem 8.6. Given a connection ‚àÜh, there is a unique parallel transport P such
that the deÔ¨Åned by it parallel transport P along paths generates ‚àÜh, ‚àÜP = ‚àÜh.
Besides, P coincides with the parallel transport assigned to ‚àÜh.
Proof. Apply Theorems 8.2 and 8.4.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have presented a short (and partial) review of (one of the ap-
proaches to) the connection theory on bundles whose base and bundle spaces are
(C2) diÔ¨Äerentiable manifolds. Special attention was paid to connections, in particu-
lar linear ones, on vector bundles, which Ô¨Ånd wide applications in physics [146,155].
However, many other approaches, generalizations, alternative descriptions, partic-
ular methods, etc. were not mentioned at all. In particular, these include: connec-
tions on more general (e.g., topological) bundles, connections on principal bundles
(which are important in the gauge Ô¨Åeld theories), holonomy groups, Ô¨Çat connec-
tions, Riemannian connections, etc., etc. The surveys [32, 156] contain essential
information on these and many other items. Consistent and self-contained expo-
sition of such problems can be found in [23,110,151,157].
If additional geometric structures are added to the theory considered in Sec-
tion 3, there will become important connections compatible with these structures.
In this way arise many theories of particular connections; we have demonstrated
that on the example of linear connections on vector bundles (Section 4).
The consideration of arbitrary (co)frames in Section 5 may seem slightly
artiÔ¨Åcial as the general theory can be developed without them. However, this is not
the generic case when one starts to apply the connection theory for investigation
of particular problems. It may happen that some problem has solutions in general
(co)frames but it does not possess solutions when (co)frames generated directly by
local coordinates are involved. For example, local coordinates (holonomic frames)
normal at a given point for a covariant derivative operator (linear connection)
‚àáon a manifold exist if ‚àáis torsionless at that point, but anholonomic frames
normal at a given point for ‚àáexist in a case of non-vanishing torsion.
In Section 6, we saw that the theory of normal frames in the most general case
is quite trivial. This reÔ¨Çects the understanding that the more general a concept
is, the less particular properties it has, but the more concrete applications it can
Ô¨Ånd if it is restricted somehow. This situation was demonstrate when holonomic
normal frames were considered; e.g., they exist at a given point or along an injective
horizontal path, but on an open set they may exist only in the Ô¨Çat case. A feature
of a vector bundle (E, œÄ, M) is that the frames in T (E) over E are in bijective
correspondence with pairs of frames in E over M and in T (M) over M. This
result allows the normal frames in T (E), if any, to be ‚Äòlowered‚Äô to ones in E. From
here a conclusion was made that the theory of frames in T (E) normal for linear
connections on a vector bundle is equivalent to the existing one of frames in E
normal for covariant derivatives in (E, œÄ, M).

9. Conclusion
399
The concept ‚Äúparallel transport‚Äù precedes historically the one of a ‚Äúcon-
nection‚Äù and was Ô¨Årst clearly formulated in the work [29] of Levi Civita on a
parallel transport of a vector in Riemannian geometry. The connection theory
was formulated approximately during the period 1920‚Äì1949 in a series of works
on particular connections and their subsequent generalizations and has obtained
an almost complete form in 1950‚Äì1955 together with the clear formulation of the
concepts ‚Äúmanifold‚Äù and ‚ÄúÔ¨Åbre bundle‚Äù [32]; the concept of connection on general
Ô¨Åbre bundle was established at about 1970 [158]. During that period, with a few
exceptional works, the ‚Äòparallel transport‚Äô was considered as a secondary concept,
deÔ¨Åned by means of the one of a ‚Äòconnection‚Äô. Later, as we pointed at the begin-
ning of Section 8, there appear several attempts for axiomatizing the concept of a
parallel transport and by its means the connection theory to be constructed; e.g.,
this approach is developed deeply in vector bundles in [23]. The major classical
results on axiomatization of parallel transport theory are presented in Table 9.1.

The main merit from Section 8 is a necessary and suÔ¨Écient conditions when
an axiomatically deÔ¨Åned parallel transport (or a parallel transport along paths)
deÔ¨Ånes a unique connection (with suitable properties) and vice versa. Moreover,
the concepts ‚Äúconnection,‚Äù ‚Äú(axiomatically deÔ¨Åned) parallel transport,‚Äù and ‚Äúpar-
allel transport along path‚Äù (i.e., one that satisÔ¨Åes equations (8.4) and (8.5)) are
equivalent in a sense that there are bijective mappings between the sets of these
objects. However, the concept of a parallel transport admits a generalization to
the one of a transport along paths and there exist transports along paths that
cannot be generated by connections or axiomatically deÔ¨Åned parallel transports.

Notation Index
The frequently used symbols with a Ô¨Åxed meaning are listen below. They are ar-
ranged in more or less alphabetical order. Since the sorting of mathematical sym-
bols is not unique, they are sorted according to up to three criterions: the symbol‚Äôs
name or pronunciations (if any), the name of symbol‚Äôs kernel (root) letter, and
the meaning of the symbol as a whole. For some symbols such a classiÔ¨Åcation is
not unique, due to which they are listen more than ones; e.g., ‚àácan be found
under the letters ‚ÄúC‚Äù, standing for Connection or Covariant derivative (sorting by
meaning), and ‚ÄúN‚Äù, standing for Nabla (sorting by name). Besides, a multiple ap-
pearance of a symbol under diÔ¨Äerent sorting letters may mean that it has diÔ¨Äerent
meanings in diÔ¨Äerent but similar contexts. The number(s) standing to the right of
the symbols denote the page(s) where the symbols Ô¨Årst appear or are deÔ¨Åned.
