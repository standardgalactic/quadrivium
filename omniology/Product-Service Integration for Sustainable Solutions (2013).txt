Preface
Product-Service Integration for Sustainable Solutions
Worldwide, a change toward more value-oriented thinking has recently been taking
place. This goes along with a structural change from a product-centric to a service
society, which affects private life as well as industry. Companies in mechanical engi-
neering and plant manufacturing have recognized the great potentials which lie in the
paradigm shift of providing customer value instead of selling products. Thus, estab-
lished industrial companies are pursuing the integration of products and services and
develop innovative business models for solution-oriented businesses. This development
is further driven by the recent progress of important enablers for IPS2, such as wireless
data transmission, mobile devices and applications, and other advances in information
and communication technology. These enable new forms of location-independent col-
laboration and smart products, which already have and increasingly will inﬂuence value
creation in various branches.
One considerable motivation for product-service integration is seen in a signiﬁcant
potential for sustainability gains, both for provider, customer and society as a whole.
Increased economic sustainability can be achieved by prolonged and intensiﬁed part-
nerships with customers and suppliers, which brings along a beneﬁcial combination
of individual competences and sustainable competitive advantages. Prolonged lifecy-
cles with continuous product updates and reuse services during IPS2 closure increase
resource efﬁciency and contribute to environmental sustainability. Integrated products
and services provide solutions to systematically support and qualify inexperienced ma-
chine users. This grants companies in developing countries with low technical qualiﬁ-
cation access to advanced technologies and allows them to raise their performance in
the global competition.
In order to allow providers and customers to make use of the full potential of product-
service integration, methods and tools for the planning, development, operation and de-
livery of IPS2 need to be developed, evaluated and applied. The organization of IPS2,
their marketing and selling, risk management, knowledge management, business mod-
els for IPS2 and many more relevant topics pose various challenges and offer promising
approaches for the engineering of IPS2. Therefore, methods and tools from various

disciplines, e.g. mechanical engineering, economics and computer science need to be
combined to exploit the full potential of product-service integration.
I am very delighted to see that this strong interdisciplinarity is reﬂected in the grow-
ing scientiﬁc community of researchers and practitioners around the world. For the
ﬁfth time, this international community has come together at the international CIRP
Conference on Industrial Product-Service Systems to discuss recent developments, re-
search ﬁndings, visions and applications in the ﬁeld of IPS2. After previous confer-
ences in Cranﬁeld (2009), Link¨oping (2010), Braunschweig (2011) and Tokyo (2012),
this year’s conference is to be held at Ruhr-Universit¨at Bochum, Germany, which is
the place of foundation of the Collaborative Research Centre / Transregio 29 “Indus-
trial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) – Dynamic Interdependencies between Products
and Services in the Production Area”. Transregio 29 has been funded by the German
Research Foundation (DFG) since 2006. Around 40 researchers from Ruhr-Universit¨at
Bochum and Technische Universit¨at Berlin in 15 subprojects and 3 transfer projects
have dedicated their common effort to this challenging, interdisciplinary ﬁeld of re-
search. Therefore, I am particularly excited about hosting this year’s conference in
Bochum and look forward to many presentations on cutting-edge research, lively dis-
cussions and enlightening insights into the various facets of Industrial Product-Service
Systems.

Abstract. This paper aims to present a landscape of interests that are emerging 
for the future of maintenance in Industrial Product-Service Systems. Across 
manufacturing industries there is growing interest to integrate products and ser-
vices, where maintenance has a key role in delivering performance driven solu-
tions (e.g. availability). It is observed that industry is aiming to gain competitive 
advantage, and the customer is increasingly intending to transfer the risks and 
uncertainties as reflected in contracts. The shift towards services is also putting 
more pressure on industry to accurately predict service requirements in terms of 
resulting cost and performance that enables the service provision. In light of 
these drivers, technologies and organisational themes are emerging to reduce 
uncertainty and cost for the in-service phase as explained and discussed in the 
paper.  
Keywords: Maintenance, Through-life Engineering Services, Industrial

Introduction 
Manufacturers are increasingly recognizing that the in-service phase of the life cycle 
offers increased revenues and profitability [1]. This has promoted the need to under-
stand the processes, resources and technologies that are required to sustain and en-
hance the equipment health and performance over the life cycle. This paper focuses 
on the Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) context and aims to present an over-
view of the trends in product maintenance research to support the integrated product 
and service offering. Maintenance serves as the major engineering service in the IPS2 
delivery model. Maintenance involves a combination of technical, administrative and 
managerial actions during the life cycle of an item with the aim of retaining it in, or 
restoring it to, a state in which it can perform the required function [2]. Also, Mainte-
nance, repair, and operations (MRO) or maintenance, repair, and overhaul involves 
resolving any sort of mechanical, plumbing or electrical device issues in the case of  
becoming out of order or broken. Whilst the customer is typically acknowledging the 
large cost burden experienced from maintenance, innovative forms of contracting are 
increasingly emerging that puts further pressure on the solution provider to extend the 
product life cycle through services and so reduce the overall cost [3,4]. The  

2

motivation of this paper is to guide both academia and industry to understand the role 
of maintenance in IPS2 type contracts and to explain how the cost and performance 
targets can be achieved. Section 2 presents an overview of maintenance and asso-
ciated targets. Section 3 presents the emerging themes for the future of maintenance. 
Finally, Section 4 covers concluding remarks.

Understanding the Role of Maintenance 
2.1 
Research Background in Maintenance and MRO 
Research interest in maintenance and MRO within the engineering domain (including 
aerospace, defence and engineering) has been growing dramatically since 2005, as 
demonstrated in Figure 1. The search was conducted in Scopus with the keywords: 
maintenance or MRO and aerospace or defence or automotive. It is also recognized 
that the USA has produced over 600 articles, whilst the two other highest article pro-
ducing countries have been China and the UK with over 200 articles from each.   
 
 
Fig. 1. Number of publications in maintenance and MRO 
There are a number of dedicated research centres within the area, which highly in-
fluence the publications, including:  EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in 
Through-life Engineering Services (UK), Integrated Vehicle Health Management 
Centre (UK), Aviation Services Research Centre (China), Fraunhofer Innovation 
Cluster MRO in Energy and Transport (Germany), Center for Advanced Life Cycle 
Engineering (USA), Luleå Railway Research Center (Sweden) and The Center for 
Intelligent Maintenance Systems (USA).

2.2 
Shifting Customer Targets: The Role of Contracts    
The IPS2 literature classifies the types of business models into three categories [1, 3]. 
Firstly, the function-/product-oriented model concentrates on selling the product in a 
traditional manner, while additional services are included (e.g. maintenance, repair). 
The second model, known as use-/availability oriented (e.g. Contracting for Availabil-
ity – CfA), focuses on selling the use or availability of a product that is not owned by 
the customer (e.g. leasing, sharing). Thirdly, the result-oriented model offers the sale 
of a result or capability instead of a product (e.g. selling parts instead of the facility 
for manufacturing them). These models can be subdivided into several individual 
business models, where the models differ for various reasons (e.g. ownership of  
product, payment method, supply of operating personnel) [3]. However, it is worth 
recognising that there is currently an emphasis in industry to enter into CfA type 
agreements [4]. 
When the solution provider takes decisions such as whether to bid for a contract or 
accept one when offered, they need to do so based on an understanding of the uncer-
tainty in maintenance for the duration of service delivery [5]. This necessitates better 
prediction of uncertainty for IPS2 than has been typical of traditional contracts in the 
past because the contract timescales are much longer, and ownership of uncertainty 
has been transferred from customer to the solution provider - typically on a fixed-cost 
basis [4, 5]. Furthermore, as major agreements with large financial burdens, driven by 
cost and schedule estimates, can be agreed at the bidding stage, there is a need to 
apply rigorous steps to take account of the influence of uncertainty on cost [6]. 
 
 
Fig. 2. Uncertainty and types of solutions in IPS2 [5] 
The IPS2 context offers a larger set of uncertainties that industry needs to manage, 
due to the enhanced scope and complexity of the service solution being offered [5]. 
Some of the areas to consider include assessing the performance and the requirements 

4 
R. Roy, J.A. Erkoyuncu, and A. Shaw 
 
of the service delivery, and the enhanced dependence on external sources. For in-
stance, obsolescence is increasingly becoming challenging to manage and is creating 
large cost implications. Obsolescence, which is most often experienced in electronics 
equipment’s, refers to the state of being which occurs when an object, service or 
practice is no longer available even though it may still be an effective technical 
solution [7]. Its mitigation requires an integrated supply chain and flexibility in the 
design of equipment with a view on how to tackle the obsolescence issues that may 
arise in a planned or unplanned manner. Driven by such aspects the delivery of ser-
vice is less well understood at the early stages compared to the traditional model, due 
to the increase in the experienced uncertainties [5].

CfA are currently being awarded on the basis that they span the manufacturing and 
in-service phases of the CADMID lifecycle but the bids are often prepared and sub-
mitted in earlier phases [5]. The move towards CfA has followed an iterative transi-
tion, which has experienced a shift from providing the traditional business model into 
spares inclusive maintenance contracts (e.g. product oriented), CfA (e.g. use oriented) 
and contracting for capability (e.g. result oriented), as represented in Figure 2. The 
traditional business model stands at one extreme where the product and the service are 
considered separately and the service is an add-on feature to products that are sold. 
Roy and Cheruvu [3] identified different IPS² contract types from the literature and 
various industries, as illustrated in Table 1. These are classified into three types: fixed 
price, cost plus and performance. Fixed price contracts, concentrate on delivering the 
solution at the agreed price and pose the highest risk option for the solution provider. 
As a result, adequate measures (e.g. technology adoption) need to be taken in order to

reduce cost and control service delivery. The cost plus approach introduces risk shar-
ing between the customer and the solution provider, where costs/savings are shared 
for certain scenarios as specified in the contract. Thirdly, performance contracts are 
highly driven by incentives and promote further collaboration along the supply chain. 
Among these approaches, there is an emphasis to agree fixed price contracts, which 
can span the whole lifecycle of the equipment. Table 1 also presents the major chal-
lenges that are experienced across all the presented contract types. Datta and Roy [6] 
highlighted that the main parameters considered during the process of agreeing 
contracts are responsibility, cost of performance and incentives.  
2.3 
Targets of Maintenance in IPS2 
Maintenance is currently increasingly being included as part of the OEM’s 
responsibility for most fixed priced long-term contracts that guarantee the 
performance of the system [2]. Therefore manufacturers are beginning to enhance 
maintenance activities to reduce the whole life cost [4,5]. The wide range of 
maintenance activities include inspection, testing, measurement, adjustment, repair, 
upkeep, fault detection, replacement of parts, servicing, lubrication, and cleaning. The 
service system for maintenance consists of materials (parts), tools, people and equip-
ment/machines [2]. Furthermore, an infrastructure needs to be built, which varies 
from deterministic production models into one that copes with high variability. This 
infrastructure needs to cater for the material flow, storage, repair, transportation, 
communication and information systems [5]. Due to these reasons it has commonly 
been suggested that delivering after sales service is more complex than delivering the 
products themselves. The service delivery process is challenged by uncertainties that 
arise from demand and supply. McManus and Hastings [8] defines uncertainty as 
“things that are not known, or known only imprecisely”, where it encompasses as-
pects including “liability to chance or accident,” “doubtfulness or vagueness,” “want 
of assurance or confidence; hesitation, irresolution,” and “something not definitely 
known or knowable”. The uncertainty in demand may occur from the complexity 
(dependent on know-how) of the delivered equipment, the machine usage condi-
tions/environment, or usage levels, along with the customer’s willingness to pay. 
From a schedule point of view, the solution provider faces challenges particularly in 
terms of meeting reliability, maintainability, and availability targets that are typically 
agreed at the outset of agreeing a contract [5]. As follows, the sources of cost reduc-
tion will depend on materials and labour requirements (driven by failures) and the 
confidence in estimating these [6]. Labour is considered in terms of skill level and 
scale of labour requirements. Material estimates tend to be based on similar historical 
projects and follow the equipment breakdown structure. The estimated labour and 
materials demonstrate performance related targets, which are driven by meeting cost 
and schedule targets. Figure 3, illustrates a framework for targets in maintenance, 
which are associated with increasing predictability (driven by technologies), availabil-
ity (driven by reliability) and reducing or sustaining cost (driven by strate-
gies/contracts/failure). On the other hand, the uncertainty in supply may be influenced 
by supportability, resource availability and the capacity across the service supply 
chain [9]. As follows, service quality is a function of the scale and scope of customer 
demand and supplier capacity to respond to the demand.

New Challenges for Maintenance in IPS2 
The shift in maintenance requirements promotes new challenges for industry. The 
solution provider needs to account for the performance driven requirements and pre-
dict the life cycle of components. This requires detailed uncertainty management 
through information flow between the customer and solution provider about the 
equipment health [10]. This is necessary in order to derive proactive maintenance 
strategies that reduce life cycle cost. Also, extending the life cycle and adequate ap-
plication of MRO holds an important role in achieving reduced costs, and meeting 
performance requirements. The flow of data and the feedback across projects facili-
tates establishing maintenance cost models at the earliest possible phases of the  
lifecycle and evolves as the lifecycle progresses and in agreeing new contracts [6]. 
However, it is essential that companies take account of the new challenges that are 
driven by uncertainties. These relate to the new uncertainties experienced with agree-
ing CfA and involve, for example, the role of availability on cost, payment based on 
performance, end user equipment usage, change in capability requirements, supplier

dependence, and training for availability [5]. In addition to many other reasons, accu-
rate prediction of such new challenges is proving to be demanding in developing reli-
able cost and schedule estimates for contracts. In order to further emphasise the issues 
Figure 4 lists the key uncertainties that have been highlighted by four organisations in 
the defence industry that are involved in IPS2 projects [5]. Failure rate, managing 
obsolescence and gathering data about equipment utilization emerge as some of the 
key areas to focus on.

Emerging Themes for the Future of Maintenance  
It is increasingly recognized that the in-service phase of the life cycle creates the larg-
est amount of cost. Maintenance, which is a driver of in-service costs, to a large ex-
tent cannot be avoided due to a number of reasons such as consumables, wear, plug 
and play technology upgrades, and standardization of interfaces. As a result the cus-
tomer has become increasingly interested in minimizing the cost of whole life cycle 
ownership of assets. On the one hand, strategies have moved towards reduction of 
maintenance (e.g. schemes to avoid failure – design for zero failures), and higher 
predictability (e.g. visualize future wear) that drives availability. Such aspects need 
fundamental questions to be answered including:  
1. Is it possible to avoid replacing “consumable” components (e.g. engine oil, 
windscreen wipers)? 
2. Is it possible to prolong the life of systems and components? 
3. Is it possible to avoid the replacement/refurbishment of worn components? 
4. Is it possible to eliminate wear?  
5. Is it possible to reduce maintenance activity through improved autonomy? 
6. Is it possible to predict and build in possible upgrades of parts/systems during the 
design process? 
7. Is it possible to have modularity to insert new capabilities with developing tech-
nologies?  
On the other hand, the significance of cost has promoted changes in contractual ar-
rangements. Like so, the literature has emphasised that ownership and 
use/employment (e.g. CfA) are increasingly being separated. Research within this 
area has focused on the role of the bidding stage. For instance, research has been 
made to incorporate the influence of uncertainty [5], and of obsolescence [7] to cost, 
and to provide guidance on contract selection [3]. Furthermore, standards certification 
has also been an area of interest where research has been conducted for cost engineer-
ing related terms [10]. It is worth recognizing that the shift towards services has gen-
erated further aftermarket business opportunities for the solution provider and supply 
chain. The following section provides a detailed account of the emerging themes for 
maintenance, as illustrated in Figure 5.  
Failure is the tip of the iceberg where maintenance has a role to reduce the impact 
of many issues such as wear, play, slackness, leakage, dust, dirt, corrosion, deforma-
tion, adherence of raw materials, surface damage, cracking, overheating, vibration, 
noise and other abnormalities. Developing a detailed maintenance plan can assist in 
handling of component and system failure. This particularly becomes essential in IPS²

Fig. 5. Overview of future themes for maintenance within an IPS² contract environment 
in order to meet the cost pressure and performance requirements. Adequate measures 
taken can assist in  achieving fewer failures and unplanned breakdowns, the increase 
in robust diagnoses and prognosis, a shorter waiting time until the system works, a 
better working environment, and less environmental pollution (e.g. lower energy and 
raw material consumption). Furthermore, the design and manufacturing phases are 
increasingly being acknowledged to drive the impact on the service provision, whilst 
feedback from the service is progressively playing a key role for each of these phases.   
3.1 
Standardisation 
Putting in place a mechanism for standardization, supports with determining technical 
specification, quality management for an engineering project or a safety standard and 
with many other aspects [10]. Furthermore, it may result in early adoption of novel 
technologies, reduced costs, improved uptime and to avoid major disasters. Within the 
maintenance area standards are required in a number of areas including [11]:  
1. Interoperability of diagnostics data 
2. Quality of diagnostic systems and data 
3. Backward compatibility 
4. Maintenance using remote monitoring 
5. Wireless protocols for system monitoring and remote repair 
6. Obsolescence management 
7. Terminologies for new technologies 
8. Whole life costing

In order to achieve these targets there is a need to perform a gap analysis on the exist-
ing standards landscape, to develop a delivery plan to fill the gaps and to educate 
regulatory bodies on the direction to be followed. 
3.2 
Application of Advanced Information Technology  
Maintenance as a concept has experienced a major philosophical transformation from 
the traditional view of “fail–and–fix” maintenance practices to “predict–and–prevent” 
e-maintenance based strategies. This has promoted a network based architecture that 
shares, integrates and synchronizes the vast number of maintenance and reliability 
applications to gather and deliver asset related information as designed. This network 
of information sharing is illustrated in Figure 6. The network refers to the link be-
tween the customers operations and the feedback that is collected from remote cus-
tomer sites and analysed in order to plan suitable maintenance steps. A key role that 
assists the flow of information is enabled by e-maintenance. This can be achieved 
using Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices that enhance the applicability of mo-
bile maintenance management [11]. The main technologies that assist the application 
of e-maintenance include the internet, wireless devices, smart tags, micro-size MEMS 
sensors especially designed for maintenance purposes and low-cost online lubrication 
analysis sensors [11]. Also, information processing tools enable the continuous data 
flow through a distributed and collaborative web platform system at the higher end of 
the processing hierarchy. These assist in re-designing maintenance strategies in a cost 
effective and environmentally friendly manner.  Such approaches have been compre-
hensively reported in the literature, however Redding et al., [12] highlight that the 
application of such technologies has in comparison been below expectations. Though, 
it is expressed that there is a large desire to adopt such technologies.  
 
 
Fig. 6. Process of information gathering 
Sensors may be in the form of wired or wireless sensors, whilst both have com-
monly been acknowledged to offer large potential to sense, store, and analyse equip-
ment data to predict health status [11]. However, the reliance on sensors for condition 
monitoring requires robust and reliable sensors and data processing. In parallel a 

10 
R. Roy, J.A. Erkoyuncu, and A. Shaw 
 
shortcoming has been observed with sensor failures happening between the time in-
tervals of check-ups [13]. Additionally, within the nuclear power plant context, issues 
have been observed with electromagnetic and radio frequency interference 
(EMI/RFI), cyber security, and installation issues such as the coverage of the wireless 
signal [13]. Redundancy has been considered to be an approach where a wired sensor 
is used as the primary source, whilst in the case of a breakdown (e.g. due to a loss-of-
coolant accident) wireless transmission of data may offer a more reliable option.   
Increasingly commonly are sensors which collect information about vibration and 
apply diagnostics techniques that enable the trending of equipment health. However, 
the shortcoming of the approach lies in the cost of full physical check-ups. Apart from 
the technology requirements, there is also a need for vibration experts, who are typi-
cally highly educated and costly. Thus, a cost-benefit analysis is required in order to 
decide whether adding a sensor to the monitoring program will be beneficial. It is also 
worth recognizing the value of reducing uncertainty and facilitating the delivery of 
IPS² that meets cost and performance targets.  
3.3 
Optimise Life 
The maintenance strategy needs to facilitate the optimization of the life cycle of the 
equipment. For this purpose the future of maintenance will need to concentrate on a) 
developing suitable simulation approaches; b) schemes that facilitate adaptability; c) 
modular maintenance and d) disposal decision making [11]. Figure 7 shows an over-
view of these concepts.  
 
 
Fig. 7. Achieving optimized life 
During the life cycle of maintenance, with up to date information about the equip-
ment health, suitable simulation approaches need to be adopted in order to develop 
trend analysis and to predict reliable life expectations. Various techniques such as a 

 
The Future of Maintenance for Industrial Product-Service Systems 
11 
 
Bayesian probabilistic approach and Markov chains have increasingly been applied 
[11]. In particular the Bayesian approach is gaining much interest due to its ability to 
dynamically update data based on the monitoring of outcomes on specified model 
parameters and thus revising the probability of damage for each substructure. The 
parameters may be directly related to the process such as temperature, pressure, vibra-
tion or humidity, or be higher level descriptors such as process safety, efficiency, or 
level of output [14]. This approach allows the tracking of gradual changes, such as 
fatigue and corrosion, and offers the opportunity to detect issues at an early stage well 
before the risk of failure. As an outcome such information enables to determine the 
spare parts demand and supply schedules to reduce time and amount of maintenance.  
A common feature of the life cycle is the need to modify the equipment because of 
changes in capability requirements, affordability issues, or technological advance-
ments for example. However, recognizing the costs of change at the outset and the 
implications on the duration of the life cycle are challenging. In order to reduce these 
challenges researchers have applied rule-based systems to define the potential range 
of modification strategies [11]. Though, building a comprehensive scope of modifica-
tion strategies and recognizing the dynamic nature of this scope is also challenging. 
For this purpose, optimization studies have a valuable role in guiding decision making 
with such issues. Nevertheless, selecting optimal rule refinements is an unsolved 
problem that requires further research.  
Modular maintenance refers to a procedure that allows replacement of major as-
semblies, called modules, with a minimum of amount of expenditure and time. Fur-
thermore, the removed modules follow a cycle by being returned to the repair facility, 
bench test, repair, and inserted back in to the equipment [9]. However, designing this 
procedure is challenging because one has to consider the sub-modular cost structures 
that capture the dependencies between various components and modules in the sys-
tem. It is also important to design suitable redundancy mechanisms and appropriate 
schemes to resolve maintenance issues such as obsolescence.  
Decision making for disposal is also challenging and requires simulation studies 
that take account of the stochastic nature of the condition of the equipment. The op-
timal point for disposal occurs when the carrying cost exceeds the disposal cost. 
There are a number of aspects that need to be considered including (a) product 
recovery operations require expensive and skilled labour; (b) timing and quantity of 
discarded products; (c) cost of recovered components resulting from the unpredictable 
disposal of products and stochastic demand; (d) costs originating from surplus 
inventory; (e) stock-outs causing lost sales; (f) disposal cost of leftover and obsolete 
inventory; (g) competition from OEMs, and (h) restrictive environmental  
regulations [15]. 
3.4 
Autonomous Maintenance 
Autonomous maintenance means developing capability within a high value system to 
maintain itself and also developing maintenance systems that collaboratively provide 
autonomous capability to perform maintenance on a high value system with minimum 
human intervention. This improves robustness of a system and influences the ability 

12 
R. Roy, J.A. Erkoyuncu, and A. Shaw 
 
to meet performance and cost targets. Among autonomous maintenance approaches 
self-healing is highly attracting attention. Self-healing systems aim to mitigate, detect 
and recover from failures [16]. The initial step involves defining an appropriate archi-
tecture that specifies components, their relationships within a system coupled with 
topology (with number and placement of components in a system). This architecture 
helps to mitigate the effects of failures by providing guidance with increasing system 
redundancy. Subsequently, failure detection techniques are applied and involve moni-
toring component health and uncertainty analysis in order to realize the remaining life 
in a reliable manner. This leads to recovery techniques, which define actions to a 
component in order to address suspected failures. Self-healing systems comprise con-
sistent mechanisms that provide a means to maintain a synchronized state among 
distributed components by propagating state changes to remote components. Research 
has concentrated on robotics and software development that establishes connections 
between failure and healing mechanisms [16]. Furthermore, large engineering systems 
in safety critical situations already have a level of self-diagnosis (built in self-test or 
BIST) and self-fix, if not self-immobilisation to prevent more serious damage. How-
ever, the migration of self-repair to lower value systems is a process which engineer-
ing is just beginning. Future research will need to concentrate on solutions that are 
easy, cheap and quick to adopt.   
3.5 
Degradation  
Degradation refers to the process of deterioration of characteristics of an object with 
time; gradual decline in quality; breakdown of matter due to the impact of external 
forces in conformity with the laws of nature and time. The degradation issue could be 
categorized in to component and system level. At the component level the degradation 
mechanisms are wear, cracks, corrosion etc. At the system level the degradation mani-
fests as no fault found (NFF). Given the variety and complexity of mechanisms, there 
is a need to understand their drivers and ways to mitigate their implications.  
In the process of investigating the mechanisms there is a growing interest in realis-
ing NFF. NFF refers to system or component that has been returned to the 
manufacturer or distributor for warranty replacement or service repair, but operates 
properly when tested in laboratory environment [11]. Investigations have shown the 
occurrence of NFF in coupled whole systems with electronic, electrical and mechani-
cal sub-systems. Solutions have always proved difficult. The root causes can be di-
verse and many are specific to particular industries, but the problem can occur from 
incorrect diagnostic techniques or tests, poor training, incorrect processes, operational 
pressures poor design. The costs can be significant particularly when assets are now 
being contracted at a fixed price per hour of their availability. An investigation by the 
Royal Air Force showed some 60,000 man-hours being attributed to nugatory main-
tenance activity on NFF. Similar wasted efforts will be occurring in the Army and 
Navy, Railways, Wind Turbines and High-end car industries. There are three different 
classes of NFFs, all of which will be addressed here: a) Intermittent faults, a fault is 
indicated but ‘goes away’ a short time later, b) Integration faults, a component or sub-
system works fine on test but shows faults when incorporated with other systems and

13 
 
c) BITE (Built-in-Test Equipment) indicates a fault but there is insufficient informa-
tion available to locate the exact unit or component to be replaced [11]. Various tech-
nologies can be employed to investigate NFF decisions including environmental test 
chamber and, intermittent fault detection, as shown in Figure 8.

Additional Themes  
Apart from engineering based issues that are faced in maintenance there is also inter-
est in more soft issues including how to design the skill set to deliver the maintenance 
solution, how to structure the organization to meet the requirements, maintaining 
safety and how to organise the supply chain. There is also growing interest in aligning 
with environmental requirements. In particular, the role of maintenance in meeting 
regulations is a challenging area that requires further research. Furthermore, from a 
financial point of view, with the wide application of carbon trades the significant role 
of maintenance in producing environmental pollution will be further assessed and 
may yield financial benefits to trade pollution. Maintenance does not only have a role 
to ensure reliability of equipment, but it also requires consideration of providing a 
safe and healthy environment for the maintainers [17]. The maintenance requirements 
due to failures and failure expectations within the plant are evolving and the potential 
risks are transforming. Future research will need to assist in assessing the technical 
risks but also in determining what is acceptable risk by society.

Concluding Remarks  
Maintenance as a service is a major driver for the whole life cost of an IPS²project. 
There are new and revised challenges in the form of customer requirements and un-
certainties that needs addressing to make an IPS² project a success. Some of these 
aspects relate to meeting availability requirements, managing reliability, obsolescence 
mitigation, achieving supply chain integration, supporting and guiding customer 
equipment utilization. Maintenance activity needs to further develop to address these 
additional challenges and that could be achieved through technological and organiza-
tional development. The major technological trend in the maintenance that is expected 
to influence the future includes application of advanced information technology, au-
tonomous maintenance, managing degradation and mechanisms to optimize life. Also, 

14

there is an increasing need to standardize the maintenance terminologies and technol-
ogical processes to support the supply chain and implement best practice.

Abstract. Coming from the very successful Toyota Production System (TPS), 
the presented thesis is dealing with the design of a fully integrated production 
system for the use of industrial services which emphasize/assume the idea of 
services being produced like any other real hardware products. 
To increase profit margin from the machine sales and furthermore creating 
additional customer value, industrial Services are gaining more and more atten-
tion among the machine tool manufacturer. Due to this business development, 
an efficient delivery of industrial service products in terms of time, quality and 
cost are becoming essential for the success of one’s business. 
Keywords: Industrial service, production system, lean management, optimiza-
tion, continuous improvement, lean service, systematic rationalization.

Introduction 
A couple of years ago industrial services in the capital goods industry were not really 
recognized as a very important part of the business. However, today services is a one 
of a kind instrument for the differentiation among competitors and beyond that, ser-
vices make up quite a share of the total revenue for most of the machine tool manu-
facturers. 
Stagnation in the core product market, due to homogenization among competitive 
products on the one hand and a shift in demand towards services on the other hand 
has been leading to decreasing product margins for years. At the same time margins in 
the services business have been increasing. While services can reach net profit mar-
gins of 20%, the earnings out of new machine sales are leveling off at plus/minus 1% 
[1-2]. 
From a manufacturer’s point of view, the reasons for the higher profit margins in 
the services business are multilayered. Due to the fact that services are not easy to 
imitate they fulfill one of the most important characteristics for premium products. 
Therefore they are unique and thus, differentiating [1]. 
Further, increasing competition in the machine tool business is forcing manufac-
turers to launch new and innovative product lines in very short sequences. Conse-
quently, the product engineering and design process also needs to be cut down. Due to 
this market development, amortization times for engineering costs can be decreased. 
The active sales of industrial services products such as consulting, financing, training, 
maintenance etc. and a smart way of linking those services to the hardware product 

18 
K. Tonn 
 
helps to increase the average profit margin and thus, to keep the amortization times 
down [3]. 
Changed customer expectations in the capital goods industry have led to a respec-
tive change in demand. Customers are no longer looking for a machine with specia-
lized functions constantly increasing performance alone. More and more, customer 
focus lies on integrated solutions and the optimization of lifecycle costs. Therefore, 
the design and sale of industrial-product-service systems is the key for most machine 
tool supplier. Today’s demand for maximized productivity and machine availability 
can only be fulfilled with the help of services components [4]. 
In the discussion of industrial-product-service systems industrial services such as 
maintenance, repair, machine installation and ramp up, as well as the spare part 
supply, training and application consulting are taking over an important part to 
achieve the customer’s expectations [5]. 
Seeing the importance of industrial services the efficient delivery of services in 
comparison to the hardware product is becoming a crucial part for the success of 
business models based on the idea of industrial-product-service systems. Operating 
figures such as delivery time, output quality and the price for services should be fo-
cused on to keep up with the very efficient production processes in the manufacturing 
of hardware products. 
Standardization as well as process automating needs to be a main focus of the 
management of industrial services in the future to ensure an efficient delivery of the 
product-service bundle. 
Management approaches such as „Total Quality Management”, “Lean Production” 
as well as “Business Reengineering tools” need to be transferred to industrial services 
delivery processes in order to make them become more professional in the way of 
competitive advantages [6-7]. Coming from the very successful Toyota Production 
System (TPS) the design of a fully integrated production system for the use of indus-
trial services will be discussed in the following chapter.

The Technical Service in the Machine Tool Business 
The industrial service or technical service department in the organization of a ma-
chine tool manufacturer is one of the main service delivery units which takes care of 
all technical service issues around the company’s core product: the machine.  
According to the definition of MUSER and KLOSTERMANN, technical service is 
one kind of industrial services, a secondary service, which is always linked to capital 
goods such as machines or any kind of production equipment [5,8]. 
Thus, technical services are delivered on objects and are therefore different in 
comparison to consumer services such as medical treatments or a haircut which are 
usually conducted on human beings. Having a look at the input factors, technical  
services are mainly dominated by human beings and their technical experiences. In 
addition to the human factor, the right information- and communication technologies 
become a crucial success factor. This is especially true for the field force in terms of 
teleservice or reporting functions. 
While the time of the service delivery is mainly concentrating on the after sales 
phase the place of delivery can vary from customer to customer which is one of the 
biggest challenges when focusing on the optimization of the technical service  
organization.

Hence, the standardization of the workplace of a service engineer is much more 
complicated than in a factory where the surroundings and needed tooling can be ar-
ranged and adjusted as needed. Unpredictable working conditions combined with the 
autonomy of external factors often lead to unsteady cycle times and make the resource 
planning process very difficult to manage. 
Further, technical services are not always supplied by the manufacturer of the ma-
chine tool; parts of the services, such as the logistics of spare parts are frequently 
provided by subcontractors. Besides the outsourcing, the worldwide delivery of tech-
nical services is characterized by co-operational networks where agencies or sales and 
service subsidiaries around the world are working together to provide services on the 
installed machine base [9]. 
In general, the classical scope of technical services can be narrowed down to main-
tenance and repair procedures including the spare part supply and logistic. According 
to the DIN 31051 the maintenance and repair services are defined by inspections and 
the attendance [10]. 
Building upon the general definition of technical services by MUSER and 
KLOSTERMANN and having the constitutive characteristics of services, such as 
immateriality, the integration of an external factor as well as the simultaneity of  
delivery and consumption in mind, important implications for the design of a fully 
integrated production system for technical services can be derived. Table 1 is summa-
rizing these implications by focusing on the three service dimensions (potential, 
process and solution), comparing these with the characteristics of a hardware product.

General Structure of Fully Integrated Production Systems 
Today’s interpretation of the term “production” includes a lot more than just the man-
ufacturing and assembly of products. According to SPATH, production incorporates 
“all tasks of the production process” [11].

Therefore, value-adding as well as non-value adding tasks, such as the production 
planning and control, the disposal, material logistics, maintenance and quality control 
functions are playing an important role in today’s production systems. 
The integrated reflection of the term “production” is closely connected with a 
process-orientated value creation approach. Within this, the processes have to flow no 
matter how many IT and organizational interfaces exist. Thus, an almost waste-free 
process flow with zero defects is the main idea to follow up on. The most important 
elements in this value-creating process are the people, the organizational structure as 
well as the single processes and the technology which have to be in line with the pro-
posed production strategy [11]. 
Following the system theory, HEINRICH defines a fully integrated production sys-
tem as “the sum of all elements and relations between which are directly influencing 
the production “[12]. 
Taking the definitions by HEINRICH and SPATH in consideration, PFEIL came 
up with a rather general framework structure for integrated productions systems 
which can be applied for services as well as hardware products [13] (see Figure 1). 
 
Fig. 1. General framework of an integrated production system 
The single elements of this structure can only reach their full potential when, 
aligned among each other, forming an integrated system, which secures the quality- 
and productivity goals of an established production strategy.  
Integration of employees as well as the activation of their abilities is one major 
challenge in the process of designing an integrated production system [11]. 
Behavioral guidelines within a production system serve as general guiding prin-
ciples for employees and management within the whole value-chain whereas produc-
tion efficiency is playing a major role for defining operational behavioral guidelines. 
Following SKINNER [14], the dimensions quality, cost, time and flexibility are cru-
cial in order to quantify efficiency. 

 
The Structure of a Fully Integrated Production System for Industrial Services

Today, every integrated production system is built upon a variety of principles and 
methods derived from the lean management approach. Principles are overriding the 
methods and applied on a higher level of abstraction in all core- and sub-processes, 
such as well-known principles like Just-in-time (JIT), flow production, etc. The tools 
for successful implementation of the principles within a production system are 
represented by the methods. They describe a standardized process for the handling of 
problems and usually lead to a solution, which closely tie the principles to the 
processes. 
Permanent alignment of the behavioral guidelines, principles and methods with the 
production strategy ensure the optimal indentation of these elements. Only a conse-
quent alignment with the company structure can guarantee a high degree of efficiency 
in the whole system [13].

An Integrated Production System for the Technical Service  
Derived from the structure of an integrated production system according to PFEIL, as 
well as from the known service dimensions (potential, process, solution/output), inte-
grated production systems are a promising approach for the technical service as well. 
In the context of product-service bundles they enable a systematic optimization of the 
delivery processes by the use of well proven lean management principles and  
methods.

A possible concept for a fully integrated production system for the technical ser-
vice as well as the adaptation of the lean principles will be discussed in the following 
chapters. The framework in figure 2 was therefore developed to structure this discus-
sion. 
The integrated production system for technical service mainly consists of three 
main sub-systems such as the execution-, design- and management system which are 
closely interlinked with each other. 
The operative controlling is essentially representing the link between the manage-
ment and the execution system. By controlling, the management can navigate and 
correct the operative processes, as well as give input for system design and develop-
ment. 
In addition to the controlling, the management system is responsible for shaping 
the execution system regarding evolutionary and/or revolutionary needs [15]. Here, a 
special developed design system with needed methods and tools supports the opera-
tive management. 
4.1 
Execution System 
The execution system is generating the services and is the unit where systematic op-
timization measures are being applied. In essence, the execution system consists of 
three process types: 
The supporting processes are responsible for building up the Service capacity and 
capability. The recruitment of service technicians, their first qualification and the 
advanced trainings are of crucial important for a technical service department.  
Although IT infrastructure with smart software applications are widely in use for 
supporting service technicians throughout the problem solving process, service per-
formance is still heavily depending up on the competence and experience of every 
single technician. 
The operational core process is building upon the initial work of the supporting 
processes of the execution system. 
Beyond the machine setup at the customer’s side including the first ramp up and 
the customer training the technical service department is taking care of the machine 
throughout the whole product life cycle. Meanwhile, the intensive interaction with the 
machine products and the customer is one of the most essential characteristics of the 
technical service. Unpredictable incidences as well as the need for customized solu-
tions are causing undefined cycle times which make the capacity planning in service 
even more difficult. 
Lastly, the service planning and control process is the overriding element within 
the execution system. Similar to a control center, this is where all service assignments 
are being planned and coordinated. Software-based planning tools and manually 
maintained planning tables support this complex task. Main challenges for this 
process are the in-time availability of qualified technicians, the organization of spare 
parts and respective service tools as well as the travel planning. Aligning service dates 
with clients, as well as planning routes for differently specialized technicians is 
therefore part of the challenge [16]. 

 
The Structure of a Fully Integrated Production System for Industrial Services

Similar to the planning of production programs for real products the service plan-
ning is also striving to minimize delivery and waiting time for maintenance, repairing 
and machine installation. However, in contrast to production, service planning does 
not have the opportunity of stock-keeping in order to absorb fluctuations in  
demand [17]. 
4.2 
Design System 
Just like the well-known Toyota production system, the derivation of a design system for 
the above-presented execution system is substantially based on the lean philosophy. 
In a first step, the different types of waste (non-value adding work) such as over-
production, stock-keeping, rework, waiting time etc. known from production are 
adapted to the processes and outputs of an industrial service delivery system. Once 
this is established, lean principles, like pull, flow, cycle tact, leveling, etc. and their 
methods can be assigned to the industrial service delivery processes.  
Defining overproduction for material goods as generating more output than is be-
ing demanded by the market at a certain point in time, the definition of output in 
terms of services has to be clarified before the lean principles can be applied to indus-
trial services. 
The output of services could be a machine, which is functioning fault-free after the 
maintenance, as well as the number of repairs provided within a previously defined 
time frame. But how can overproduction even exist in this context, where services are 
simultaneous being delivered as well as consumed? 
When approaching technical failures of a machine, a technician often needs nu-
merous attempts until the cause of the problem is identified. Consequently, overpro-
duction arises, when the technician needs more than one attempt in order to solve the 
problem. This can be due to lacking experience or complicated failures. Thus, the 
“trial and error principle” can be defined as one form of overproduction within Indus-
trial services.  Similar to “trial and error”, working techniques which vary strongly in 
output and time represent a form of overproduction as well as. 
Due to the simultaneous of delivery and consumption of technical services, it is not 
possible to store or to build up stock of these services as described above. However, 
the concept of stock-keeping becomes relevant when referring to the availability of 
qualified service technicians. The long qualification and training process for techni-
cians within the machine tool industry requires long-term capacity planning as well 
“stocking” a certain number of technicians within this process. 
Coming back to the “trial and error principle”, stock-keeping becomes essential for 
effective supply of possible solutions in order to reduce overproduction in the sense of 
numerous attempts within the problem solving process. Thus, providing stored know-
ledge just in time supported by IT-based solution structures and linked with respective 
solution-probabilities is a relevant approach to minimizing overproduction. 
Beyond that, bad Quality and rework are types of wastes, which also have to be in-
terpreted in the context of technical service before principles and methods for optimi-
zation can be applied. Rework is taking place, as soon as long solution-times and 

24 
K. Tonn 
 
multiple service attempts1 tie up the scarce capacity of the service technicians. This 
may be caused by missing information and standard procedures, delays in organiza-
tion of spare parts, or by lacking qualification of the technicians. 
Long solution times and planning-intensive multiple field missions can be ap-
proached within the framework of a design system, e.g. by the usage of teleservices 
and automatic applications for diagnosis. Further, the introduction of so-called “Stan-
dard Operating Procedures“(SOPs) and standardized tool kits can help in minimizing 
lead time in the field in the sense of keeping the “Mean Down Time” (MDT) to a 
minimum.  
Further classical types of waste can be discussed in similar ways in the context of 
industrial services, and building upon the Lean principles, approaches for optimiza-
tion can be derived. 
4.3 
Management System 
The operative management as an essential part of a fully integrated production system 
for industrial services is responsible for control and steering the execution system. 
Also, depending on external influences and strategic inputs, it is accountable for the 
continuous evolution of the existing elements within the design system. 
On the way to developing a lean production system for technical service, it is in-
dispensable to define measurable performance indicators for identifying divergences 
of the set objectives and judging of effectiveness of applied measures. 
In the literature known as “Performance-Measurement”, two significant aspects 
within the framework of any management system can be identified. AUSTIN is refer-
ring to „motivational measurement” on the one hand and “informational measure-
ment” aspects on the other hand. Performance indicators are motivating employees 
and management and can influence positive behavior by given the measurement of 
the correct indicators.  Whereas the informing aspect of performance indicators 
forms the basis for well-grounded management decisions and guarantees certain ef-
fectiveness in the decision-making process [18]. 
The integration of all employees in the performance measurement process is a cru-
cial success factor for a consequent alignment of the execution system with the de-
fined performance indicators and the implementation of a continuous improvement 
culture. 
The Shopfloor-Management approach is hereby focusing directly on the place of 
value-creation with the objective to enable employees to solve current problems sus-
tainably for a better performance. In order to make this approach work, the respective 
management has to be present [19] and management and shopfloor employees togeth-
er have to get to the bottom of the problem [20]. Thus, primary concern is the further 
development of the improvement abilities of the employees.  The manager is func-
tioning like a trainer and enables his employees to use respective methods for syste-
matic problem-solving and thus, to continuously improve processes.  
                                                           
1  Multiple field missions or support attempts can come up when a technical problem cannot 
be solved by the first attempt.

Besides Ishikawa-diagrams and the A3-method, the most cited method in literature 
for problem-solving within shopfloor management is the PDCA-cycle. Starting with 
description and analysis of the issue at hand (PLAN), followed by the implementation 
of respective measures (DO) and the comparison of the achieved result with the initial 
situation (CHECK) and lastly the repetition of this cycle (ACT) when deviation is 
detected. This process forms a crucial and substantial element within shop floor-
management. However, the improvement potential to be realized via the PDCA cycle 
is heavily depending on the frequency of application and the repetition within short 
cycles.

Summary 
The development of a fully integrated production system for the delivery of technical 
services is a possible approach for the systematic optimization of services delivery 
processes within the machine tool industry. Derived from the Toyota Production sys-
tem for real products, this paper introduced a possible framework, which is composed 
of three subsystems called execution-, design- and management system and described 
their interrelation as well as emphasizing their interactions. 
To increase profit margin from the machine sales and furthermore creating addi-
tional customer value, industrial Services are gaining more and more attention among 
the machine tool manufacturer. Due to this business development, an efficient deli-
very of industrial service products in terms of time, quality and cost are becoming 
essential for the success of one’s business. The systematic optimization of core 
processes such as machine installation and ramp up, maintenance, as well as repair 
will be a challenge for all machine tool manufacturers in the near future. While the 
production and assembly processes of real products such as cars, machines and any 
kind of consumer white products were undergoing a constant industrialization process 
over the past decades a fully integrated production approach needs to be developed 
for the effective and efficient delivery of industrial services in the future. Only manu-
factures who are able to transform their service organization into an effective working 
integrated production system will gain benefits from a product-service system.

Abstract. The introduction of engineering methods is considered a promising 
approach to the effective and efficient design of Product-Service Systems 
(PSSs). The authors have conducted studies on Service Engineering in Japan in 
order to provide a fundamental understanding of services as well as concrete 
engineering methods to design and develop them. This paper denotes the need 
to progress from Service Engineering to PSS Engineering. In addition, methods 
and tools that can contribute to PSS design are discussed.  
Keywords: PSS Engineering, Design, Service Engineering. 
1 Introduction 
As society advances, services and knowledge have become increasingly important in 
many industries [1]. Indeed, the term servitization indicates [2] that the service and 
information provided through a product are more important than the product itself, 
even in the manufacturing industry. For this reason, Product-Service Systems (PSSs), 
which create value by coupling a product and a service, have attracted much attention 
[3]. For the effective and efficient design of PSSs, the introduction of engineering 
methods is considered a promising approach. However, compared with the existing 
research on product design, there have been fewer studies on the design of services 
from the engineering perspective [4-6]. 
2 Practical Scientific Approaches 
2.1 Genesis 
Due to the situation mentioned in Section 1, we began in 2001 to conduct research on 
Service Engineering (e.g., [7]), the aim of which is to provide both a fundamental 
understanding of services and concrete engineering methods to design and develop 
them. Here, we define a service as the provision of a means to integrate a tangible 
object (a physical product) with an intangible object (an action product) that realizes 
some required value for a customer. The goal of our work is to develop a design me-
thodology of services under this definition.  

28 
Y. Shimomura and F. Akasaka 
During the first stage of our research, from 2001 to 2005, we established a generic 
procedure for modeling and analyzing services based on our research background in 
Design Engineering. Furthermore, we developed the basic structure of a service com-
puter-aided design (service CAD) software system called Service Explorer [8, 9]. We 
used scientific design methodology and service engineering to develop tools to identi-
fy the values that are required and the societal and artificial systems that are needed to 
achieve the values.  
In the second stage, from 2005 to 2011, engineering methods to support service de-
signers were implemented in Service Explorer as plug-in software modules. In this 
stage, we focused on analyzing and designing a one-to-one relationship between a 
provider and a receiver. 
Now the door to the third stage of our research has opened. Whereas in the pre-
vious stage we focused mainly on the one-to-one relationship between two specific 
stakeholders, in the third stage we are concentrating on the system aspect of PSS. Our 
focus is the complex network of multiple stakeholders, such as product manufactur-
ers, service suppliers, and original equipment manufacturers, in a PSS structure. In the 
next stage of our research, we will establish methods to design an integrated product-
service business that realizes win-win relationships among multiple stakeholders. 
2.2 From Service Engineering to PSS Engineering 
The concept of PSS is sometimes regarded as merely the combined provision of a 
product and service that fulfills customer needs (e.g., machine and maintenance). 
However, such a view of PSS shows an insufficient understanding of the original PSS 
concept, the essence of which is a social system where all stakeholders, including 
providers and receivers, can receive sufficient values through cross-offerings of prod-
ucts and services. This system, represented by the last S in PSS, consists of various 
stakeholders who provide and / or receive products and services Thus, in the current 
study, a PSS can be defined as a social system that enhances social and economic 
values for stakeholders through the co- and cross-offering of products, services, and 
product-services within the system. Here, a product-service means an integrated offer-
ing of product and service.

Toward Product-Service System Engineering: New System Engineering 
29 
From this viewpoint, Service Engineering progresses to Product-Service System 
Engineering. In the new approach, we regard PS System design as the design of (1) 
PS Synergy, (2) PS Strategy, and (3) PS Structure: PSS3. The concept of PSS3 is illu-
strated in Figure 1. Here, PS Synergy is a value amplification mechanism by a PSS 
offering. PS Structure indicates a stakeholder network for value offering, and PS 
Strategy means a strategy to construct win-win relationships among stakeholders. 
2.3 Research Strategy Map 
As mentioned in 2.2, we regard PSS3 as the set of PSS design dimensions. In PSS 
design, a PS Strategy is designed by determining the concrete values to be provided to 
stakeholders by integrating product and service. Thus, a Value Analysis is needed. 
The design of a PS Structure is performed through a discussion of how to embody the 
PSS offering structure (i.e., PSS Embodiment). PS Synergy can be clarified and the 
design improved through the evaluation of the synergy effect. Based on these discus-
sions, Value Analysis, Embodiment, and Evaluation are regarded as practical realiza-
tion phases of PSS3. 
Figure 2 illustrates the research strategy map of our research team. On the map, 
methods and tools that have already been developed or that are now being developed 
are classified in the PSS design phases and from a design perspective. The PSS design 
phases are composed of three steps: Analysis, Embodiment, and Evaluation. Howev-
er, the three design perspectives—those of the Customer, Business, and Environ-
ment—are included in the map. The core modules of Service Explorer, which is the 
most important achievement of our research, are shown in the center area of the map. 
Methods and tools that support designers in specific design phases are mapped as 
satellite modules. Methods and tools illustrated as satellite modules are explained in 
Sections 3, 4, and 5.

3.1 Customer Perspective 
Module A: Persona / Scenario Analysis. To extract the requirements of service re-
ceivers, a persona is described for each agent that works as a receiver in the service. 
The persona is a tool used mainly for software interface design to give a simplified 
description of a customer. It works as a compass in a design process [10]. According 
to this persona, subsequently, a scenario is developed to clarify the context in which 
the service is received. The scenario is described in the form of a graph representing a 
scene transition. For each described scene, the receiver’s state is represented as a set 
of parameters (Figure 3).

Module B: Group Decision-Making Method. This method attempts to derive the 
group opinion and to minimize customer dissatisfaction by using grading scores [11]. 
The grading score is the weighted value of each customer that would influence the 
total opinion of the group [12]. The total dissatisfaction of all the customers is defined 
as the sum of the distances between individual opinions and the group opinion, which

31 
is affected by the grading score. This method is used to derive the requirement values 
for a target service by minimizing the dissatisfaction of all the customers. It is particu-
larly effective for the design of public services (Figure 4). 
Module C: Value Analysis Template. While the persona model and scenario model 
are scientific methods for extracting receivers’ requirements, they use a form of repre-
sentation based on natural language. Their use, therefore, requires a certain amount of 
training given the diversity of vocabulary selection and the difficulty of determining 
synonymy. To describe these models more simply, we developed templates as a con-
venient means of preparing data corresponding to each stage of model building. We 
developed a framework consisting of five templates, shown in Table 1, that assist in 
the tasks of (1) describing personas, (2) describing scenarios, and (3) extracting re-
ceivers’ requirements. We are, thus, able to implement a system that supports the 
comprehension and analysis of personas, scenarios, and provided values. 
The original value analysis template was developed for B2C service design. Akasaka 
et al. [13] extended the original template and developed one for B2B service design. 
3.2 Business Perspective 
Module D: SOM-Based Business Chance Finder. We have developed a method to 
support designers in generating business design ideas [14]. In this method, the similarities 
of business seeds are visualized on a two-dimensional map using the Self-Organizing 
Map (SOM) technique [15] (Figure 5). The similarities of business seeds are calculated 
as the similarities of values offered with business seeds. By using the map, designers can 
identify business seeds that may fulfill receivers’ requirements. For example, the green 
cluster includes business seeds A6, E11, F9, G10, I2, J3, and J7. These business seeds 
can provide values such as Reduction of Noise, Flexibility of Installation Space, and 
Reduction of Operating Cost. Therefore, if a designer has to design a way to reduce oper-
ating costs, the business seeds in this cluster can be applied.

4 Embodiment Phase 
4.1 Customer Perspective 
Module E: View Model. The view model [7-9] is a model to design a functional 
structure of a service that fulfills receivers’ requirements. Figure 6 shows an example 
of a view model consisting of functions, described as 'verb + noun' (e.g.,  'brew + 
coffee'), and entities that have been used in product design methodologies (e.g., [16]). 
In this model, preliminary functions that fulfill receivers’ requirements are described 
and deployed into sub-functions. Human resources (e.g., staff) and physical products 
(e.g., monitoring camera and sensor) are associated with the lowest-level functions as 
function carriers.  
Module F: Extended Service Blueprint. The extended service blueprint is a model-
ing method to describe a service process which consists of service activities and  
product behaviors [17]. The origin of the concept is the service blueprint, which is 
commonly used in service marketing to describe service activities undertaken by a 
customer, a front-line [Note: What is meant by a “front-line”? Please clarify], and a 
support team in the performance of a service [18]. However, no service blueprint is 
available to describe the role of products in a service process. Thus, the extended 
service blueprint was developed to describe not only service activities performed by 
human resources and related software but also product behaviors performed by hard-
ware and related software. The notation of the extended service blueprint is based on 
Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) [19]. The extended service blueprint 
represents the parallel and interactive activities and behaviors of employees, custom-
ers, and product. In Figure 7, the interactions among the activities of floor staff and 
kitchen staff and the behavior of a coffeemaker are illustrated using BPMN.

Fig. 8. Conflict detection with the lexical expression of functions 
Module G: Conflict Detection. When a service that fulfills receivers’ requirements is 
designed, conflicts can be found. For example, two functions, 'increase staff' and 
'decrease staff,' may exist in separate service models of the same service. To avoid 

34 
Y. Shimomura and F. Akasaka 
this problem, the conflict-detection method analyzes objects and predicates of func-
tional expressions using the lexical expression database [9] (Figure 8). In addition, a 
method to solve the extracted conflicts with TRIZ [20] has also been proposed.  
Module H: Design Matrix for Modular Service Design. The design matrix method 
is used to optimize the composition of service modules based on Suh's axiomatic 
design [21]. In service engineering, a module is determined in terms of the (function / 
attribute) relationship. Table 2 is the design matrix for service design which shows the 
(function / attribute) relationship with the character 'X.' To determine service compo-
nents, service designers first determine modules from the (function / attribute) rela-
tionship. A module uncoupled from the others is defined as a single component which 
is the minimum subset of decoupled modules to satisfy the Independence Axiom [21]. 
By means of this matrix, service designers can configure a flexible and reliable ser-
vice structure.  
Module I: Function Embodiment Knowledge Base. We have developed a method 
and prototype system for knowledge-based PSS design [22] to support the acquisition 
of new PSS design solutions by integrating design knowledge managed within a 
knowledge base. In this method, a unit of information is represented by a set of three 
elements--function, entity, and delivery process--which enables designers to manage 
knowledge of both product and service shares in PSS cases. The desired knowledge is 
sought based on similarities between functions and is provided in catalog form. By 
using this system, designers can find alternatives to PSS design solutions.  
Table 2. A simple example of a design matrix 
 
4.2 Business Perspective 
Module J: Resource Allocation Method. Resource distribution is not easily de-
signed because of the vast search space and the complexity of the problem to be 
solved. Therefore, a method to determine the optimal value of the resource distribu-
tion by means of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been proposed [23]. This method 
optimizes resource distribution from two viewpoints: customer satisfaction and inter-
nal resource constraints. 
5 Evaluation Phase 
5.1 Customer Perspective 
Module K: Importance Analysis. Based on the view models, a method to analyze 
the importance of design parameters by means of Quality Function Deployment 

 
Toward Product-Service System Engineering: New System Engineering 
35 
(QFD) [24] and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) [25] to improve a service 
structure has been proposed. QFD is a systematic analysis method to translate cus-
tomer needs into the requirements and specifications of a design object. Meanwhile, 
the AHP method numerically computes the importance weights of receivers’ require-
ments according to bilateral comparisons among parameters. After the importance of 
receivers’ requirements is obtained, it is converted into the importance of functions 
and entities by using the matrix of the QFD [24]. The matrix is created based on the 
specifications described in the view models.  
Module L: S-A Function. Unlike the importance analysis method, which evaluates 
the relative importance of requirements, the function of S-A (Satisfaction-Attribute) is 
to evaluate directly the satisfaction of service receivers [26, 27]. The S-A function 
describes the condition of service receivers' satisfaction in terms of their expectations 
of the service and the type of service function. The receivers’ expectations are used as 
comparison standards to determine whether the receiver is satisfied or dissatisfied. 
Namely, the function is divided into a gain side and a loss side at the expectation val-
ue. This type of service function was originally proposed by Kano [28], who identi-
fied three categories of product or service functions: attractive, one-dimensional, and 
must-be. Figure 9 shows the differences in the shapes of functions. The shape of an  
S-A function is determined by the analysis of the service function type. By means of 
S-A functions, the numerical evaluation of a service receiver's satisfaction can be 
performed.  
 
Fig. 9. S-A functions 
Module M: Service FMEA. Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) [29] is a 
method to analyze the failure mode, which may cause a product or service to malfunc-
tion. Since the structure of a service is complicated, various causes of malfunctions 
can be considered. Service FMEA (Table 3) attempts to analyze and prevent potential 
malfunctions. In Figure 9, failure modes of a service are listed in the far left column. 
Influences on and causes of the failure modes are also listed. 
5.2 Business Perspective 
Module N: Scene Transition Nets Simulation. The evaluation of a service should be 
done in both a static and a dynamic manner. We adopt the Scene Transition Nets 

36 
Y. Shimomura and F. Akasaka 
(STN) as a simulation model of a service process [30]. STN is a graphic modeling 
method for discrete-continuous hybrid systems [31]. Figure 10 shows the components 
of STN, which uses tokens called actors to describe discrete state changes and diffe-
rential equations triggered by the movements of the actors to describe continuous 
state changes. STN is suitable for a service process simulation since it can describe 
both the process transition and the state change of each stakeholder simultaneously. 
For example, in Figure 11, the service processes of a nursing case service is modeled 
as a discrete event system. At the same time, the dynamic nurse walking distance in a 
scene is modeled as a continuous system.

Module O: Qualitative Service Simulator. We have developed a qualitative service 
simulator that enables designers to evaluate the designed service qualitatively. Qualit-
ative simulation predicts the set of possible behaviors consistent with a qualitative 
differential equation model of the world. Its value comes from the ability to express 
natural types of incomplete knowledge and the ability to derive a provably complete 
set of possible behaviors in spite of the incompleteness of the model [32-34]. 
Module R: Cost Analysis Method. In order to make services successful, service 
designers need to consider economic costs. A cost evaluation method [35] has been 
proposed on the basis of Activity-Based Costing (ABC) [36], which is used to trace 
overhead costs for objects such as products, processes, and departments. Unlike the 
original ABC, which is a method to calculate costs of business processes, our pro-
posed method enables designers to calculate the cost of each function and entity, with 
the entity including both human resources and physical products. 
5.3 Environmental Perspective 
Module P: PS System Simulator. To realize a sustainable business through PSS, it is 
important to create a business situation in which each stakeholder receives values 
through the provision of PSS. The designers must have a holistic view and consider 
the total value created within the system. Therefore, a design method for a PSS that 
has a high value for each stakeholder has been proposed. In this method, a PSS is 
designed using System Dynamics simulation [37] under the simultaneous considera-
tion of values received by various stakeholders. Here, the global environment is also 
regarded as a stakeholder in the system so that the designers can consider the envi-
ronmental impact of PSS provision.

Module Q: Integrated Service Evaluation Method. The Integrated Service Evalua-
tion Framework (ISEF) is used to evaluate service design solutions from the view-
points of multiple stakeholders in an integrated and quantitative manner. In ISEF, 
service processes of stakeholders are described based on IDEF0 [38], a well-known 
functional system modeling method used to describe the influences of various stake-
holders. This service process model covers the entire service process, which includes 
pre-activities before the main service activity, such as manufacturing, distribution of 
products, hiring, and training of employees, and post-activities, such as maintenance, 
disposal, and after-sales service. The service is evaluated through the STN-based 
simulation technique (see Module N in 5.2). 
6 Crossover Phase 
We have developed an edutainment tool for PSS design called EDIPS (Edutainment 
for Integrated Provision of Product-service System) (Figure 12(a)). This tool is illu-
strated as Module X in Figure 2. EDIPS is a kind of business game through which 
players can learn the importance of the integrated provision of product and services to 
gain profit and learn how to integrate product and services. Figure 12(b) shows a pic-
ture taken in an international test game played by PSS researchers.

7 Concluding Remarks 
This paper denotes the need to progress from Service Engineering to PSS Engineer-
ing. Our idea is to design a PSS with three dimensions: (1) PS Synergy, (2) PS Strate-
gy, and (3) PS Structure (PSS3). We have provided an overview of methods and tools 
that can contribute to PSS design. However, few methods have been proposed that 
support value analysis and embodiment from the environmental perspective. To de-
sign a PSS that helps to reduce environmental impact, it is important for designers to 
consider environmental friendliness in the early stage of PSS design. Therefore, our 
future research will include the development of methods to support designers’ consid-
eration of environmental impact in the value analysis and embodiment phases of PSS 
design.

Abstract. Product-Service Systems (PSS) are regarded as an attractive business 
concept for manufacturing companies to enhance the value of their products. As 
both tangible products and intangible services are included in the design space, 
various alternatives have to be considered when it comes to developing design 
solutions for PSS, especially in the conceptual design phase. Therefore, in PSS 
design, designers require a broader range of knowledge to generate several de-
sign solution ideas. Taken this issue into consideration, a PSS conceptual de-
sign support system is developed in this paper. The basic feature of the system 
is managing and reusing case knowledge of PSS. The design support system is 
developed on the basis of the analysis results of the PSS design experiment. The 
effectiveness of the proposed system was analyzed using an example  
application. 
Keywords: Product-Service Systems, PSS design, design support, design 
knowledge base.

Introduction 
Product-Service Systems (PSS) [1-3] are attracting much attention from manufactur-
ing firms as a competitive and sustainable business model because they can offer high 
value-added products and benefit long-term customer relationships. For design, de-
velopment, and operation of an effective PSS, it is important to search for value pro-
vision opportunities in the entire product life cycle and offer appropriate services to 
customers at each opportunity. 
As pointed out in product design research, design knowledge obtained from past 
product cases provides helpful information to designers, especially in the conceptual 
design phase [4]. Thus, many studies in the product design area have focused on 
knowledge-based design support (e.g., [5-6]).  
Compared to product design, a broader range of knowledge is required in PSS de-
sign because both products and services are included in the design space. To identify 
an appropriate design solution or enhance the quality of a design solution, designers 
should have many kinds of design knowledge and consider various alternatives for 
design solutions. 
This paper aims at the development of a knowledge-based design support system 
for the conceptual design of a PSS. The authors have already proposed a method to 

42 
Y. Nemoto, F. Akasaka, and Y. Shimomura 
 
represent and manage PSS case knowledge [7]. In this paper, this method is extended 
to support designers more holistically and effectively. The extension is carried out 
according to the features of PSS design operation obtained from design experiments. 
Then, the design support system is developed based on the extended knowledge man-
agement method. 
The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 explains the theoreti-
cal background of this study. In Chapter 3, the existing method and the approach in 
this paper are presented. Chapter 4 introduces the developed knowledge-based design 
support system. Chapter 5 reports an application of the design support, Chapter 6 
discusses benefits and issues arising from this study, and Chapter 7 concludes the 
paper.

Theoretical Background 
2.1 
Definition of PSS 
Currently, there is no commonly accepted definition of a PSS. With respect to some 
definitions in the literature [1-3], the terms related to PSS in this paper are defined as 
follows: 
• PSS: Social systems to enhance social and economic values received by each actor 
in the network through the mutual provision of product, service, or Product-Service 
(PS) 
• PS: an integrated combination of tangible products and intangible services 
• Actor: an individual, group, or organization that is actively engaged in the PSS 
(e.g., a provider, partner, or customer) 
2.2 
Conceptual Design of PSS 
Methodologies for Conceptual Design of PSS. Some studies have addressed the 
conceptual design of PSSs; these emphasized that designers have to consider what 
should be offered to the customer and how to realize this offering in the conceptual 
design phase of the PSS (e.g., [8-9]). 
 To model and design the offering in the PSS, the concepts of function and entity, 
which are originally used in product design methodologies (e.g., [10-11]), have been 
highlighted in many of these studies (e.g., [8, 12]). “Function” is an abstract concept, 
which represents what should be offered to fulfill the customer’s needs. “Entity” is a 
concrete measure to realize a function; namely, it represents the required resources to 
prepare, operate, and maintain the PSS offering (e.g., staff, technicians, machinery, 
and facility). 
Design Operations in PSS Design. To understand the features of design operation in 
the conceptual design of PSS, the authors have analyzed the protocol data, which is 
the recorded dialogue among the designers involved in the design experiments for a 

 
Knowledge-Based Design Support System for Conceptual Design of PSS

PSS design [13]. The term “design operation” means the derivation of one concept 
from another concept in the design object. 
The following list outlines the three typical design operations in the conceptual de-
sign of PSS that have appeared many times in the data. Figure 1 presents an example 
of these operations. 
• Design operation 1: functions are derived from the customer’s needs. 
Designers propose functions to fulfill the customer’s needs by considering existing 
business cases. 
• Design operation 2: entities are derived from a function. 
Designers associate physical products and/or human resources with particular func-
tions. 
• Design operation 3: functions are derived from an entity and an actor. 
Designers determine how functions can be offered by the entity and its supplier, i.e., 
the actor. Then, they consider the possibility of additional fulfillment of the custom-
er’s or other actors’ needs by offering these functions. This operation is aimed not 
only at enriching the offering in the PSS, but also at evaluating whether the entity and 
the actor should or should not be adopted.

Knowledge-Based PSS Design Support Method 
3.1 
Existing Method and Challenges in This Paper 
For the purpose of supporting PSS designers in the conceptual design phase, the au-
thors propose a PSS design knowledge management method [7]. In this method, a 
piece of PSS case knowledge is represented as the set of a function, entities, and ac-
tors. Pieces of collected knowledge are provided to designers on the basis of two clas-
sification criteria: value and phase. The criterion “value” represents the types of value 
produced by the function. Table 1 shows the seven types of value used in this method. 
On the other hand, the criterion “phase” represents the phases of the product’s life 
cycle targeted to provide the offering. This criterion is constructed from the following

10 phases: extraction, manufacture, transport, sales, installation, use (pre), use (dur-
ing), use (post), maintenance, and disposal. These two criteria enable designers to 
identify the functions, entities, and actors that are directly related to the required value 
or customer’s needs in their own business. This method is comparable to the support 
for the design operation 1. However, the design operation 2 and 3 are not directly 
supported in this method. Therefore, designers conducting these operations have to 
rely on their own experience and knowledge.  
To support designers more holistically and effectively, this paper extends the 
knowledge management method to support design operations 1-3. This extension 
helps designers to consider various alternatives to generate a high-quality design solu-
tion in the conceptual design of PSSs.

Proposal 
Overview. In this study, a piece of PSS case knowledge is represented as the set of 
four elements: need, function, entity, and actor. Each element has two frames to de-
scribe the PSS case. The first frame describes the detailed content of the PSS case. 
The second frame is aimed at the connection with the tags. These tags are used as 
keys to search for the desired knowledge. 
The remainder of this section explains the kinds of tags that are used to represent 
knowledge and how each design operation is supported using the knowledge of the 
operation. 
Design Support for Design Operation 1. The design support for this operation is 
fundamentally the same as the previous method reported in 3.1. Thus, the tags to 
search knowledge contain “value” (seven types) and “phase” (10 phases). In this 
study, these tags are associated with “need” in the framework of knowledge represen-
tation. Designers search for pieces of knowledge using the tags value and phase. 
Then, they refer to the functions included in the found knowledge. 
Design Support for Design Operation 2. The design support for this operation is 
conducted as follows: Designers search for pieces of knowledge that have a similar 

 
Knowledge-Based Design Support System for Conceptual Design of PSS 
45 
 
function to that of the target function of this operation. Then, they refer to the entities 
and their actors included in the found knowledge. 
In the method introduced in 3.1, a function is freely expressed by natural language. 
This approach can flexibly describe the detail of a function but lead to a different 
expression of similar functions in some cases [14]. To effectively search for the 
knowledge as stated above, tags to unify the expression of the function are required. 
Thus, the tags associated with “function” are introduced in an input-output ap-
proach to function representation [15]. In this approach, a function is defined as an 
input-output relation among materials, energy, and signal/information [10]. This ap-
proach can help to unify the expression of both the product and the service function, 
although it limits the flexibility of the description [15].  
In this approach, the function tags include three elements: input, input/output, and 
output. Table 2 shows the terms used in each tag.

Design Support for Design Operation 3. In this operation, designers search for new 
functions from not only an entity, but also its supplier i.e., actor. This extended me-
thod provides support for designers from both the aspects of entity and actor. To be 
more precise, this method helps designers to search for pieces of knowledge that in-
clude: (1) an entity that is the same as the target entity, and (2) an actor who can 
supply the target entity. By referring to the detailed content on the function in the 
searched knowledge, designers can find new functions or functions not considered 
previously. To search for knowledge that includes a description of the specific entity 
and the actor, each entity’s and actor’s name is used as the tags in this study. 
3.3 
Summary 
As mentioned in this chapter, a piece of PSS case knowledge in this study is 
represented by a set of four elements: need, function, entity, and actor. The content of 
each element is described in detailed, and the tags are used to provide support in each 
support of the three design operations. Table 3 represents a piece of knowledge ex-
tracted from a PSS case involving incinerators. In this case, the customer’s need was 
for a lower incidence of sudden failures. The detailed contents are described in the 
second column of Table 3. The third column denotes the tags associated with each 
element. 
Figure 2 illustrates the elements used to support each design operation. The tags 
enclosed by a bold line were used to search for knowledge. The elements under the 
arrows from these tags enabled the designers to generate some ideas and alternatives 
in each design operation.

Implementation 
On the basis of the approach reported in Chapter 3, a prototype of a knowledge-based 
PSS design support system is developed. This system consists of three modules: (1) a 
design workspace, (2) a design knowledge base, and (3) a knowledge viewer. The 
design workspace supports the PSS’s design activities, i.e., the operation and integra-
tion of the design elements such as functions and entities. This module already pro-
vides the main functionality for Service Explorer, which is the CAD system for PSS 
design [8, 16]. The second and third modules, the design knowledge base and the 
knowledge viewer, respectively, were additionally developed in this research. The 
design knowledge base enables designers to edit and accumulate knowledge. The 
knowledge viewer provides the area to search for and refer to the desired knowledge. 
Figure 3 shows a screen shot of the developed design support system.

Settings for This Application 
The developed system was applied to the design of an example case. For the applica-
tion, the authors collected and accumulated 61 sets of knowledge from 16 PSS cases 
obtained from several reports in the literature [17-18]. 
Table 4 summarizes the settings of this application. The designer belongs to a vir-
tual company selling agricultural and construction machinery. In this application, the 
designer aims to design a PSS for a farmer in a certain developing country. The set-
tings for the target customers follow those outlined in a survey report [19].

Application 
Step 0: Preparation for the Design. In this application, first, the customers’ needs 
were extracted from the image of the target customers described in Table 4. Then, the 
phase and value tags were connected with these needs. The result of the connection is 
shown in Table 5. For example, “longer lifetime of machines” (N7) was interpreted as 
the need for reducing a repairing or repurchase cost of those agricultural machines. 
Thus, the value tag “CR” and the phase tag “maintenance” were connected.

Step1: Design Operation 1. Next, the designer retrieved pieces of knowledge on the 
basis of the value and phase tags, and referred to the functions included in the found 
knowledge. For example, the N2 listed in Table 5 was associated with the values “PI, 

 
Knowledge-Based Design Support System for Conceptual Design of PSS 
49 
 
RR, and CS” provided in the phases “installation and use (pre).” Based on the know-
ledge search using these tags, the designer identified the knowledge that include simi-
lar types of the target need; and the designer could refer to the following functions: 
hold a training workshop, station engineers who have much experience and know-
ledge, indicate a rule to be respected, etc. Starting with this example, the designer 
could find several adoptable functions to fulfill every need, except those related to N1 
and N6. 
Step2: Design Operation 2. Then, the designer searched for entities and actors to 
realize the functions derived in Step 1. The tags of the I/O elements and the I/O  
relation were used in this operation. For example, the function to fulfill N5 “monitor 
information on the machine’s use” was converted into the function “imports (I/O 
relation)” a kind of “information (I/O elements).” By conducting a knowledge search 
using these tags, the designer identified the following entities: questionnaire, wireless 
device with GPS, and customer’s information database. As the designer’s company 
has a connection with an IT system provider (Table 4), the designer decided to adopt 
a system that included the customer’s information database and wireless device to 
realize the function, the logic being that the system could be developed easily by coo-
perating with the IT system provider. 
Step3: Design Operation 3. Through these steps mentioned above, relationships 
among needs, functions, entities, and actors were constructed. In this step, to increase 
the value to use a specific entity and, thus, the value of the PSS, the designer explored 
new or not-considered functions from the viewpoint of the entity and the actor. In 
searching for the knowledge, the designer included the entity “customer’s information 
database.” Thus, the designer could refer to the following functions: update the in-
formation on a web page in a timely manner, store the failure record, deliver deter-
gents house to house, etc. In this way, the designer could identity those functions that 
were not considered through the one-sided needs-based approach (Step 0-1). 
Results of the Application. In this application, the designer considered various alter-
natives through the design supports stated above. Then, the final design solution was 
generated, as shown in Figure 4.

Discussion 
6.1 
Implications of This Study 
Effectiveness of Knowledge-Based Design Support. By using the support for the 
design operation 1, the designer could identify several functions that fulfilled six of 
eight needs; and the designer could identify the entities and actors associated with 
each of the eight functions derived from the design operation 1. In addition, the  
designer could consider an additional five functions using the support for design op-
eration 3. From these results of the support for each design operation, the extended 
method and the developed system realized effective design support for each operation 
in the conceptual design of the PSS. 
Comparison with the Existing Method. This study contributes to designers’  
knowledge on the creation of design solutions by providing PSS case knowledge. The 
developed system provides support not only for design operations 1, but also for op-
erations 2 and 3. Referring to the example of a design to fulfill the need “lower operat-
ing costs” (N5), the follows compare the existing method [7] with the extended method 
in this paper from the aspect of the result of design support.  
By using the existing method, designers can find the function “obtain customer in-
formation” which is achieve by the entities “staff of an energy firm” with “a monitor-
ing facility.” This type of structure among functions, entities, and actors is almost the 
same as that used in past PSS case. On the other hand, by using the extended method 
in this paper, the designer can find other measures to realize the function (e.g., a wire-
less device, customer’s information database, and so on). Moreover, new functions 
can be revealed from the standpoint of the entity and the actor (e.g., store the failure 
record). Thus, the extended method and the developed system may generate more 
alternatives, which are different to those provided in previous cases. 
6.2 
Remaining Issue 
Lack of Support for Convergence of Generated Ideas. Designs are based on an 
iterative procedure of the generation of ideas and the convergence of the generated 
ideas [4]. This paper developed a method and system for the generation of ideas in 
PSS design. To enable designers to select the best solution from various alternatives, 
however, a method for the convergence of ideas is needed. Therefore, future work 
should include the development of an evaluation method to indicate the best way to 
select the final solution from various alternatives, so as to maximize the value pro-
duced in the PSS. 
Applicable Scope of Design Operation 3. In this paper, the name of the entity and 
the actor are incorporated into the tags associated with them. This helps designers to 
search for knowledge that includes a description of the specific entity and the actor. 
However, each designer or constructer of the knowledge base could use a different 
description of these elements. Thus, it is important that the knowledge-based support 

 
Knowledge-Based Design Support System for Conceptual Design of PSS 
51 
 
system can determine similarities among each entity or actor by referring to an ontol-
ogy or a thesaurus. This will support the operation of the design operation 3 if differ-
ences exist in the description of an entity or an actor. 
7 
Conclusion and Outlook  
This paper proposed an extended knowledge-based design support method and devel-
oped a system based on that method. The extension was conducted to be able to sup-
port the three design operations. A piece of knowledge in this system is represented 
by a set of four elements: need, function, entity, and actor. Each element is described 
in detail, and the associated tags are used to ensure effective searches of the desired 
knowledge. The results of the analysis of the application showed that the extended 
method and the developed system support the three design operations. Future work 
should include the development of an evaluation method to select the best set of vari-
ous alternatives and the integration of an ontology into the system.

Abstract. The promise offered by industrial product service systems (IPS2) for 
lasting customer retention is well known. In order to enable this potential solu-
tion providers have to use new development methods. Furthermore the cross 
domain thinking has to be set in the developer’s mind. Providers must establish 
a product-service culture in their development department. This leads to the fact 
that new ways of teaching such an IPS2 mindset has to be found in addition to 
the research of new development methods. This paper describes one such a 
teaching approach. Based on elements of business games it teaches engineers 
not to think in separate service and product domains. Furthermore it helps to 
overcome typical difficulties which occur in IPS2 development project. For this 
reason main barriers in establishing an IPS2 mindset are listed in this paper. 
Based on these difficulties a playful way of concept generation and teaching 
cross-domain thinking is presented. 
Keywords: Teaching, IPS² mindset, conceptual design.

Introduction 
Industrial product service systems, shortened to IPS2, are highly complex systems 
which combine a wide range of different products and services in one integrated  
solution. This kind of integration has not only the potential of an innovative and cus-
tomer-oriented way of problem solving, it also allows the adaption of system parti-
tions during the adduction stage in case of changed requirements. Thus providers may 
differentiate their product portfolio from competitors by the development of IPS2 
instead of traditional solutions. This trend of transforming from a traditional to an 
IPS2 provider is well known. It already has been analyzed in various contributions [1]. 
However, this transformation poses to be a big challenge. One barrier is located in 
the development stage of novel systems. The new paradigm of seeing product and 
service as an integrated solution requires new methodological support in order to 
overcome the engineers’ traditional thinking patterns. 
This leads to the fact that the application of new development methods must be 
promoted, especially in the early design stages, planning and conceptual design. Here, 
the tasks are dominated by the engineer’s creativity instead of the product structure in 
its various appearances. Furthermore it is essential to describe a holistic way of  

54 
M. Herzog et al. 
 
problem solving as early as possible. According to the ‘Rule Of Ten’ this should mi-
nimize changes in downstream lifecycle [2]. But the provision of methodological 
support in the IPS2-conceptual design process is problematic. Developers from tradi-
tional solution providers separate strict between product and service. They are not 
able to see problems at an abstract level. As a result, solutions are designed which 
integrate services just as an addition to existing benefits in kind. Consequently, the 
innovation potential of IPS2 solutions might not be fully exploited. 
The problem of providing methodological support may be split into two sub-
problems. On the one hand there has to be a modeling approach that allows a holistic 
view on an IPS2 concept at an abstract level. In particular, the paradigm of separation 
between product and service has to be realized. On the other hand there has to be 
found a more efficient and also effective way of teaching a product developer this 
modeling approach. How can developers in the context of industrial product service 
systems learn to describe such a solution without thinking in traditional product and 
service domains?

Conceptual Design of IPS2 
2.1 
Modeling IPS2 Concepts and Product Service Interrelations 
The conceptual design stage’s goal is the generation of a solution architecture which 
shows potentially realizations of the customer’s needs. Thus, it has to describe the 
structure and the interrelationships of its system-elements [2].

In this context Sadek provides a model-based approach which allows the descrip-
tion of the architecture [3]. The so called heterogeneous IPS2 modeling approach sup-
ports the determination of a structure of performance artifacts that are assigned to a 
certain customer benefit. Because performance can be viewed from both, technical 
and economic viewpoint, performance artifacts are seen as a combination of an object 
and a process. Within an extended methodology provided by Sadek a developer is 
able to build structures on the functional, object and the process layer. Relationships 
between elements of different layers can be described afterwards. Furthermore a vari-
ation in the level of abstraction to describe elements on each single layer can be done. 
For this reason the approach is called heterogeneous modeling approach. Fig. 1 exhi-
bits its main statements. Since there are various contributions to this approach, it is 
not an aim of this paper to explain all details in depth [3]. It has been proved to be a 
reliable model to describe IPS2 in early stages of a development process. But the  
industrial application has shown that developers who are new to product-service ap-
plications have problems in using this approach. As a consequence there has to be 
special teaching approach which enables cross-domain thinking in the conceptual 
design stage of IPS2. In order to generate a holistic teaching approach the difficulties 
in this stage are given in the following section. 
2.2 
Difficulties in Establishing an IPS2 Mindset 
It is brought forward the argument that using the heterogeneous modeling approach to 
describe IPS2 concepts is an appropriate appliance [4]. Though, an industrial use case 
as it is described in [5] has shown difficulties that arise out of the circumstance that a 
company is new to the field of product-service systems. For this contribution it is 
necessary to know that this use-case is a network based development. Each network 
partner has no experiences in the field of IPS2 and the goal of the development project 
is a highly integrated product-service system with the possibility of changeability in 
case of changed requirements. In the following section the main difficulties during 
that development are listed.  
Companies which try to get into new markets by offering product-service solutions 
have not established an IPS2 mindset in their developers’ heads. Traditionally service 
is seen as a necessary evil to improve or fix technological solutions. As a consequence 
IPS2 concepts do not show up with the claimed interrelationships of products and 
services. This leads to less innovative solutions. A new culture of product and servic-
es has to be established. 
As mentioned before IPS2 are highly complex systems. This leads to the fact that 
different knowledge holder have to build a team in order to make deployed compe-
tences available. Consequently, a high number of stakeholders is involved in the  
decision making process. Though this diversity of knowledge builds the base for in-
novative problem solving, it is difficult to stimulate communication between different 
stakeholders because each single stakeholder has a different understanding of the 
problem. Consequently, an approach to get in touch with the IPS2 mindset has to sup-
port the communication within an interdisciplinary team. If there are different stake-
holders involved in the conceptual design process it is essential to find higher level 

56 
M. Herzog et al. 
 
interrelationships as a base for communication. Furthermore an initial step of abstrac-
tion is required to reduce the complexity and emphasize essential features and proper-
ties of the problem and its environment. For this reason the team members need to get 
a problem perception on a higher level of abstraction. In the context of interdiscipli-
nary teams in IPS2 conceptual design this issue also addresses the ability of single 
members to communicate with each other. 
The ability of each team member to describe the development problems on a high-
er abstraction level enables also the integration of superior viewpoints in the concep-
tual modeling process. Since an IPS2 architecture also addresses strategic questions 
e.g. the business models that need to be integrated in the decision making process. 
The teaching approach has to create an awareness of these superior viewpoints. This 
assumes also a systemic understanding of integral solution elements. Each team 
member must understand the solution and possible relationships to one’s own domain.  
Due to the fact that an IPS2 should provide an individualized problem solution it is 
very important to direct activities in the conceptual design stage towards a stringent 
customer orientation. Consequently, each functional element of the solution has to 
aim at customer benefit. Since this is a crucial key factor in the IPS2 development the 
awareness of the customer’s needs is a central aspect in the learning approach. 
 
Fig. 2. Aims of an IPS² mindset teaching approach for conceptual design 
Fig. 2 summarizes the aforementioned challenges. Since there are issues which ad-
dresses the development team and individual skills it is proposed that a teaching ap-
proach for the IPS² mindset has to be realized in form of a workshop. Furthermore the 
high degree of individualization of IPS² solution requires the possibility of problem 
specific adaption of that workshop. In the following section such a teaching approach 
to realize these requirements will be presented.

Playful Teaching of IPS² Concept Modeling 
Based on the initial situation portrayed in the industrial use-case, the composition of 
the intended teaching approach is explained in the following. In this regard one has to 
clarify what kind of teaching approach is suitable and what teaching mechanisms are 
promising to meet the defined requirements. Basically the approach avails on the idea 
of participatory design. Research implicates design to be necessary to support an or-
ganization to really change towards the demanded mindset [6]. Furthermore this kind

of teaching implies the active involvement of the multiple relevant stakeholders with-
in the value system, which is necessary in order to really create innovative and holis-
tic solutions for hidden customer needs [7]. So off-key, the participants collaborate, 
communicate about the relevant topics and learn about the IPS²-development “on the 
fly”. However there are barriers concerning successful group performance related to 
psychological and social issues [8]. Especially the industrial use case describes the 
need for involving stakeholders both in- and outside the company who vary e.g. in 
view points, culture, managerial practices and domain specific languages. Therefore 
the considered teams mostly need support for communicating and sharing ideas and 
knowledge [8]. For this purpose playful approaches are seen to be of value. This ex-
pression subsumes a set of novel practices called gamestorming, which are commonly 
applied in the business world as well as design games used to support collaboration in 
multidiscipline design tasks [9],[10]. Brandt defines games as a play with props fol-
lowing specific rules, often with an element of competition between players and de-
cided by chance, strength, skill or combination of these. Though within the addressed 
IPS² design task the aim is not to compete but to take advantage of the various skills 
and expertise´s represented in a game setting [10]. In general the concept of teaching 
approaches depends on the scope, the participants and the available resources [10].  
 
Fig. 3. Structure of the playful IPS² teaching approach 
Considering the initial situation mentioned above, generic characteristics of power-
ful design games identified by Brandt [10] are applied and concretized to identify 
beneficial mechanisms for the IPS²-teaching approach addressed in this paper. Figure 
3 presents the general structure which is characterized by three game phases (Warm 
Up: Analogy; Gamestorming 1: Transfer; Gamestorming 2: Battleships) played back-
to-back. Each of these games follows the core principles of any gamestorming tech-
nique including an opening, exploring and closing phase [9]. The promoted teaching 
approach uses game boards to collect, structure and organize the information noted on 
multicolored post it sheets. The certain game phases are guided by a moderator, who 
is in charge of managing the discussion and the game rules. To ensure an efficient

discourse about IPS² and to take all relevant viewpoints into account, the use of the 
six hats method is proposed. So the participants have to adopt the various roles  
(Objective, Intuitive, Negative, Positive, Creative, Process) during the certain game 
phases as described subsequently. 
3.1 
Warm Up: Analogy 
Learning about the really new paradigms and dimensions of IPS² requires high cogni-
tive effort [11]. Therefore it is suggested to combine the provision of information with 
mental learning mechanism [12].  
 
Fig. 4. Structure of the Warm Up 
As shown in figure 4 an analogy of the everyday life is used to warm up the partic-
ipants. So the moderator envisions the activity cycle of a fictional customer using a 
car. In round one it is the task of the participants to define problems concerning the 
shown activities (e.g. drive, parking, refuel). Therefore they should “wear” the black 
as well as the red hat, which means that they have to encourage their feelings and 
emotions belonging to the critical judgment of the certain activity. To overcome old 
habits and experience something new, the game mechanism of chance is imple-
mented. So the participants do not know about what activity they have to think about 
next [10]. After identifying the emerging problems along the customer activity cycle 
the participants are requested to have visions. They have to match so called value

cards, suggesting categories of IPS² specific value types (e.g. economic, ecologic, 
social, flexibility) with stimulating pictures showing services the participants are fa-
miliar with. By composing the appropriate pairs the participants have to complete 
open-ended questions (e.g. “I would like to...by…”) which are estimated to lead to 
more open and creative dialogues about products and services supporting the custom-
er activities and eliminate the predefined problems. This directly refers to the thinking 
of the red and the yellow hat which stimulate looking for benefits and positive think-
ing. In the last round of the warm up, the participants are asked to discuss about 
stakeholders who have to be involved to realize the desired values. So they have to 
decide about the relevant stakeholders and conclude the structure of the actor network 
including their interdependencies. In this round the goal is to teach the complex com-
position of the stakeholders, required to realize customer value. To sum up the first 
game phase of warming up teaches the awareness of the customer view, which is 
important to encourage the participants to gain insights into both views (product and 
service) in order to achieve the potentials of IPS² [7]. In addition the certain game 
levels are supposed to stimulate the “value thinking” which is indispensable to teach 
the needed IPS² mindset.  
3.2 
Gamestorming 1: Transfer 
After introducing IPS² specific aspects in a comprehensible scenario, everybody can 
identify with, this mental learning mechanism is used to manage the transfer to the 
use-case related challenges like visualized in figure 5. Therefore in the first round  
the participants have to translate the scenario activities and problems. The white and 
the green hats provide the needed creative and informational viewpoint. So partici-
pants are asked to build causal loops and tell a story about the activities, the use-case 
customer has to deal with, problems that may occur and customer support to provide 
during the whole lifecycle. In round two the generic values depicted in the first game 
are transcribed onto the actual game board. Now the participants have to match their 
new found activities and problems with the generic value categories and hereby find 
some new customer values to realize or problems that did not occur before. After 
identifying all relevant values, the underlying problems that have not been obvious 
before and support activities declared to be helpful to create the focused values, the 
participants have to decide about the actor network needed to realize the visions. The-
reby it is possible to rethink the composition of the participants of the upcoming 
game. For example it can be necessary to invite some additional partners to assure the 
best findings. Summing up the second game called “Transfer” the participants are 
confronted with the real situation of thinking about a customer in the field of galva-
nizing high quality sanitary fittings. The teaching approach strengthens the considera-
tion of the relevant lifecycles, the understanding of contributing a value instead of a 
product as well as the need of involving certain stakeholders to really innovate. 

60

3.3 
Gamestorming 2: Battleships 
After the optional reconfiguration of the participants, the last game phase intends to 
identify innovative solution principles for the desired IPS² in a creative manner. In the 
first round it is task to draw conclusions from the game phase before and define  
the main functions that are necessary to satisfy the customer needs and so realize the 
aspired values. Therefore the participants have to collect already existing information 
and identify further information that may be needed. The final identified functions are 
transcribed onto the game board like shown in figure 6. For each function there are 
two possible categories, solution principles can be attached to. Either the function is 
fulfilled by a technical object or a human activity. So this game phase is about the 
“battle” of “technical objects” versus “human activities”. For the example of the 
analogy a car can be washed (function) by an automatic washer system (technical 
object) or specialized personnel cleaning the car (human activity). So at the beginning 
of the second round the participants have to find as much solutions principles as poss-
ible by thinking creative addressed by the green hat. Following it is requested to find 
flaws related to the solutions played before. Thereby the participants create barriers 
against the identified technical objects or human activities to hinder their chances of 
success. This kind of competition is considered to stimulate the debate among the 
certain stakeholders and to establish the needed transparency of the distributed know-
ledge. In order to further support this cross domain thinking, so called incentive cards 
e.g. force the participants to find solutions by changing their viewpoint or to reframe

the function into another field of knowledge. As a result of the second round, solution 
principles and alternatives have been identified for each function predefined. Finally 
the participants have to decide about the different solutions and now are able to ar-
range these elements into a systematic order in round three.  
 
Fig. 6. Structure of the Gamestorming 2: Product vs. Service 
The final aim of the addressed teaching approach is to encourage the participants 
not to think about products and services in a separated manner but to create a system 
consisting of both material and immaterial elements that are related to each other and 
their interdependencies have to be considered already during the concept development 
to really realize the desired customer values.

Summery and Outlook 
The transformation towards offering industrial product service systems requires a 
change within the whole organization. Especially technology oriented thinking pat-
terns of developer need to be broken. This is a big challenge and it already occurs in 
early stages of the conceptual IPS² design process. For this reason a kind of teaching 
new development methods is proposed in this paper. Using playful learning mechan-
isms the approach tries to overcome the barriers of distributed knowledge and teaches

the new IPS² paradigm which is obligatory to understand if a company wants to really 
innovate with customer and value oriented solutions. The teaching approach is  
composed of certain “game modules” which can be expanded or newly arranged for 
various use cases. So, it is possible to consider and adapt to different stages in the 
transformation process (servizitation) of the particular companies. The next step is to 
evaluate the proposed teaching approach. It will be applied for the addressed use-case 
in an industrial workshop. Furthermore the “battleship” design game is tested among 
students to explore the potentials in the context of creativity methods. This allows a 
comparison of industrial and academic viewpoints. As result it will lead to new scien-
tific questions and findings.

Abstract. The realization of service that adapts to a diversity of customer re-
quirements is becoming important in many industries. A tool for extracting cus-
tomer requirements, which is called a requirements analysis template, has been 
proposed previously. However, using this tool, customer requirements are ex-
tracted without any consideration of variable environmental factors, such as  
social change and macroeconomic fluctuations, even though these factors influ-
ence customer requirements. This paper proposes a supporting method that ser-
vice designers can use to help consider such environmental factors and grasp 
customers’ “potential” requirements when they build their service strategies. To 
achieve this purpose, the requirement analysis template is integrated with scena-
rio planning methodology, which is a method used to consider environmental 
factors for business strategy planning. 
Keywords: Service Engineering, Scenario Planning, Customer Requirements, 
Environmental Factors.

Introduction 
As our society matures, productivity improvement in service industries, which  
account for approximately 70 percent of the developed world’s economy and em-
ployment, is therefore, becoming a pressing issue. Thus, the importance of service 
industries is recognizable. On the other hand, in academic fields, many research and 
development projects are intended to promote the growth of service productivity. 
Considering this, the authors of this paper have conducted conceptual research on 
design services from an engineering viewpoint. This type of research is called service 
engineering [1-2]. 
In the service design phases, the analysis of customer requirements plays a crucial 
role because the realization structure of a service should be constructed by starting 
with each customer requirement. For this reason, a tool for extracting customer re-
quirements, which is called a requirement analysis template, is proposed in service 
engineering [3]. Using this tool, customer activity is analyzed by using a service  

64

scenario that describes customer activity with natural language. On the basis of the 
service scenario, some keywords are extracted from the scenario, and then, customer 
requirements are identified based on each keyword. 
However, the service scenario is described without any consideration of variable 
environmental factors, such as social changes and macroeconomic fluctuations, even 
though these factors influence customer requirements. 
The purpose of this study is to propose a method of extracting customers’ potential 
requirements. This study focuses on the Business to Business (B2B) industry. Hence, 
the term “customer” is meant to refer to a “client company” in this paper. To achieve 
this purpose, the requirement analysis template is integrated with the scenario plan-
ning methodology, which is a method of planning business strategies while consider-
ing external environmental factors.  
2 
Previous Studies and the Scope of This Study 
2.1 
Analysis of Customer Requirements for Service Design 
The authors propose a requirement analysis template that extracts customer require-
ments via a series of templates. The first step of this method is to decide upon a ficti-
tious target customer for the relevant service. Then, information that includes the 
customers’ characteristics is added. On the basis of the information, a story about 
customer activity in a service delivery process is written in natural language. This 
story includes information that can be used for decision making in the service design 
phases. Then, considering the “phase of the service encounter” and “4W1H (what, 
what like, how, where, when),” keywords regarding the customer requirements are 
extracted. Finally, each keyword is associated with the required items/quality. Thus, 
the service designer is able to discover the customer’s requirements (See [3] for more 
details). 
This template is applicable to B2B services. The authors previously proposed a re-
quirement analysis method for the strategic improvement of a B2B service and veri-
fied the effectiveness of the method by applying it to a real service [4]. 
2.2 
Strategic Planning Method for Decision Making While Considering 
Uncertainty 
Business strategy is significantly impacted by environmental factors, and a business 
manager faces the difficult task of making decisions while considering potential envi-
ronmental factors. On the other hand, in the fields of management science, the scena-
rio planning methodology, which is a method for planning business or management 
strategy while considering environmental factors, is widely applied. In scenario  
planning methodology, in order to improve the quality of decision making, the envi-
ronmental factors are extracted, and a story about how the future might turn out is 
developed. Via this process, managers and employees increase their awareness of 
business vision. The scenario, in the context of scenario planning methodology, 
means some futuristic view of the business and a script regarding this futuristic view. 

 
Extraction of Customers’ Potential Requirements Using Service Scenario Planning 
65 
 
Preparing for future environmental factors is utilized not only in management strategy 
but also in business and national policy in the fields of global environmental conser-
vation. Thus, scenario planning methodology is applied in various fields. 
The concrete procedure of scenario planning varies widely among authors, but the 
outline is constructed mainly from the following steps. First, the purpose of construct-
ing the scenario is identified (e.g., the goals of the company and the objective of deci-
sion making). Next, information related to the business’s management is collected, 
and a driving force is selected: an external environmental factor that will influence 
future trends. Then, the selected driving force is evaluated in two aspects, namely 
impact and uncertainty. The impact refers to the significance of the influence, and the 
uncertainty refers to the difficulty of timing and result prediction. Finally, a scenario 
is constructed on the basis of the selected driving force. 
2.3 
Scope of This Study 
By using the requirement analysis template, the service designer describes a story that 
includes a customer’s activity in natural language and obtains a customer’s require-
ments from the story. However, in this context, the focus is on a customer’s activity 
regarding “as-is service”. For this reason, using the existing framework, some diffi-
culties remain in terms of analyzing customer requirements while considering exter-
nal environmental factors. 
The purpose of this study is to propose a new approach to extracting potential cus-
tomer requirements related to environmental factors. In order to achieve this purpose, 
in this paper, requirement analysis methodology is integrated with a scenario con-
struction methodology that is proposed in scenario planning. As mentioned in Section 
2.2, scenario planning is a method of constructing a scenario that includes a vision of 
the future while considering environmental factors. By using scenario construction 
methodology, the service designer is able to analyze the activity of a client company 
and environmental factors. On the basis of results of this analysis, the service designer 
is able to extract a customer’s potential requirements.

Service Scenario Planning 
3.1 
Overview of Service Scenario Planning 
This chapter introduces an overview of and concrete procedures of a service scenario 
planning framework that can enable service designers to extract a customer’s potential 
requirements. The service scenario planning framework uses the following five steps, 
as shown in Figure 1. First of all, the service designer analyzes a client company by 
using the requirement analysis template mentioned in Chapter 2.1 (STEP 1). In this 
step, a story about the customer’s activity is constructed. In this paper, this story is 
called a service scenario, and the individual sentences that comprise the story are 
called the service script. On the basis of this story, a requirement structure is con-
structed that considers the “goals” of the company and its stakeholders. Next, the 
service designer collects information about the company, and then, external environ-
mental factors are extracted from the information (STEP 2). Next, the service  

66 
K. Ota et al. 
 
designer estimates the impact and uncertainty of the factors that influence customer 
requirements (STEP 3). The most crucial factor is selected as the driving force. Next, 
the service designer identifies the service script that is influenced by the driving force, 
and then, a script that contains an occurrence of the driving force is constructed 
(STEP 4). Finally, considering the driving force, the customer requirement is identi-
fied in the procedure of STEP 1 (STEP 5). The following chapter shows the detailed 
procedure of this framework. 
 
Fig. 1. Overview of Service Scenario Planning 
3.2 
The Procedures for Extracting Potential Customer Requirements 
STEP1. Identification of Customer Requirements 
To identify customer requirements, first of all the service designer analyzes the as-is 
service and constructs a requirement structure. In concrete terms, the “goals,” which 
indicate objectives that should be achieved for each business task, are identified. 
Goals 
A goal is frequently used to extract requirements in the system design field; it indi-
cates an objective that the system under consideration should achieve. 
Based on the collected information, the corporate goals, which is the objective of 
the company, and the practical goals, which is the objective of the stakeholders, are 
identified. Furthermore, the practical goals are associated with the corporate goals 
through the decomposition of the corporate goals. The corporate goals are decom-
posed into sub-goals and then associated with the practical goals. Next, a service sce-
nario, which is a story about a customer’s activity, is written in natural language. 
From the script written for the service scenario, the service designers identify some 
“keywords” that can be considered important elements for the service. 
Finally, each keyword is associated with the required items/qualities and quality 
elements. Here, required items refer to what customers want to do, and the required 
quality is a linguistic expression of customer needs. On the other hand, quality ele-
ments work as criteria for evaluating a given quality. In this way, the service designer

obtains the requirement structure of the target client company. An example of a re-
quirement structure is shown in Figure 2. 
 
Fig. 2. Relationship among corporate goals and practical goals 
STEP2. Extraction of Environmental Factors 
In this step, the service designer extracts environmental factors using a “PESTEL 
(Politics, Economy, Society, Technology, Environment, and Legal)” framework, 
which is used for extracting external environmental factors. Concretely, first, the ser-
vice designer collects information about the environmental factors affecting the client 
company (e.g., the trends of relevant industry segments, national politics, and regula-
tions). Next, from the collected information, the key factors that seem to influence the 
client company are extracted and categorized using the PESTEL model. In this study, 
the definitions of the viewpoints are described as follows. 
Political factors 
These refer to national or regional government policy trends, such as a change in the 
ruling party, a change in public agency structure, and changes in political decisions 
such as financial assistance and business promotion. Political decisions can impact 
many vital areas of business. 
Economic factors 
These include factors that influence the exchequer and the service price of the client 
company; for example, interest rates, taxation changes, and the changing prices of 
materials and fuel. Economic factors mainly influence customer requirements-
relevant cost reduction. 
Social factors 
These include external factors that refer to changes in social trends, such as demo-
graphics, fluctuations in demand, and the reputation of local residents. For example, 
the population’s aging influences major fields of business. 
Technological factors 
Technological factors include the development of new technology and new products 
by competing companies, progress in science and technology, and the aging of  
facilities. 
 

68 
K. Ota et al. 
 
Environmental factors 
Environmental factors include natural environmental changes, such as weather and 
climate. Furthermore, global environmental issues and the depletion of natural re-
sources are also included in this category. 
Legal factors 
These refer to legal environment changes that affect an organization’s action. Con-
cretely, legal restrictions, shifts in regulation standards, and trends in judicial 
precedent are legal factors. 
STEP3. Estimation of Impact and Uncertainty 
The external environmental factors that include significant impacts and uncertainty 
can influence the requirement structure of the client company. In this step, the driving 
force is selected from the environmental factors extracted in Step 2. First, the goals of 
the customer and the environmental factors that influence those goals are associated 
with relevant environmental factors. Next, environmental factors are evaluated to 
determine the degree of impact and uncertainty. The definitions of impact and uncer-
tainty and the estimation procedures used for them in this study are described as fol-
lows. 
Impact 
In this study, the significance of a given influence in terms of customer requirements 
and business is defined as “impact.” The impact of environmental factors is estimated 
in relation to other factors that influence the same customer requirements. 
Uncertainty 
The service designer estimates the uncertainty of the environmental factors. Uncer-
tainty is defined as the difficulty of predicting when a given environmental factor will 
occur. Namely, a factor for which the service designer can easily estimate the timing 
is estimated to have a lower uncertainty. In contrast, if a service designer cannot esti-
mate the timing and predict the results of the factor, it is estimated as having a great 
deal of uncertainty. The degree of uncertainty is evaluated absolutely. 
On the basis of the definition above, environmental factors are evaluated on a five-
point scale. Then, the factor that receives the highest number of points is considered 
the driving force. 
STEP4. Scenario Construction 
In Step 3, the driving force and relevant goal are identified. In Step 4, the script in the 
case of the occurrence of the driving force is constructed. The procedure of Step 4 is 
shown in Figure 3. First, on the basis of the requirement structure, the required item 
that is related to the goal-relevant driving force is identified (Figure 3(a)). Next, the 
service script that is related to the required item is identified (Figure 3(b)). Finally, the 
service designer constructs a new script using the driving force (Figure 3(c)). Con-
cretely, the service designer assumes the occurrence of the driving force, and possible 
customer activity is also written. In this way, the service designer reconstructs the 
service scenario.

STEP5. Identification of the Customer’s Potential Requirement 
Using the reconstructed service scenario, customer requirements are analyzed via the 
same procedure used in Step 1. Using the steps mentioned above, the service designer 
obtains the customer requirements while considering the driving force. Therefore, by 
designing a service by starting from an identified requirement, an enhanced service 
that can deal with a given environmental factor will be the result.

Application of an Example Case 
This section discusses how the proposed method was applied to a B2B service, a fa-
cility construction and maintenance service, in which a utility company was the client 
company. In this example, the utility company offers a social infrastructure service 
and maintains lifelines for the public. Thus, the social responsibility of the utility 
company is important. On the other hand, a facility construction/maintenance compa-
ny constructs and maintains the facilities of the utility company. 
STEP1. Identification of Customer Requirements 
First of all, a requirement structure is constructed for the as-is service. In this exam-
ple, on the basis of an annual report released by the utility company which includes 
information about management and strategy, corporate goals were extracted (e.g., 
increase in profit, acceptance of social demands). Then, the corporate goals are de-
composed into sub-goals; for example, the corporate goal “increase in profit” is de-
composed into the sub-goals “cost reduction” and “business expansion.” 
Next, the practical goal, which is the objective of the stakeholders in the client 
company, is identified. In this example, the practical goal “cost reduction of utility 
work” is identified by focusing on stakeholder-relevant utility work, and this practical 
goal is associated with the sub-goal “cost reduction” (Figure 4 (A)). 
Then, a service scenario, which is a story about a customer’s activity to achieve 
this practical goal, is written (Figure 5). From the script written for the service scena-
rio, the service designers identify the customer’s requirements (Figure 4).

STEP2. Extraction of Environmental Factors 
In this step, the first information about the environmental factors affecting the client 
company was collected based on an annual report that the client company released.

In this example, 31 kinds of information were collected, such as “cutting subsidies for 
wind power enterprise” and “demand of applying noise regulation low for the wind 
power plant.” Then, this information was placed into six categories of the PESTEL 
framework. For example, “cutting subsidies for wind power enterprise” was placed 
into the political factors category, and “tightening environmental regulations” was 
placed with the legal factors. The result of classification is shown as Table 1.

Increase of natural disasters (e.g., earthquake, torrential down-
pour), Weather variance 
Legal factors

tions 
STEP3. Estimation of Impact and Uncertainty 
Environmental factors, extracted in Step 2, are associated with goals in the require-
ment structure, and then evaluated to determine the degree of impact and uncertainty. 
In this case, when service designers focused on the sub-goal “cost reduction,” the 
environmental factor “escalating fuel price” is associated with the sub-goal. The envi-
ronmental factors relevant to the sub-goal “cost reduction” are shown as Figure 6. 
Next, environmental factors are evaluated to determine the degree of impact and un-
certainty, and then “extensive replacement of facility equipment” is identified as a 
driving force (Table 2).

STEP4. Scenario Construction 
In this step, the script in the case of the occurrence of the driving force is constructed. 
In this case, on the basis of the requirement structure, the quality element “low cost of 
equipment” is identified as a relevant factor to the sub-goal “cost reduction.” Then, 
the script that is related to the quality element is identified. Thus, the script related to 
the driving force is also identified. Concretely, first of all, the quality element “low 
cost of equipment” is identified by focusing on the keyword “low cost.” Thus, the 
script underlined is identified as influenced by the driving force (Figure 7(a)). 
Next, the scenario is reconstructed based on the driving force. In this case, the ser-
vice designer assumes the occurrence of the driving force “extensive replacement of 
facility equipment,” and possible customer activity is also written. Concretely, in the 
case of occurrence of the driving force, the skilled worker employed at the time of 
construction has already retired. Furthermore, the skills were not passed on to young-
er workers. For this reason, there is fear of a prolonged construction period and in-
creased cost. The script mentioned above is incrementally written as a new script 
(Figure 7(b)).

In this step, the keyword “Inherit technique” is extracted from the restructured service 
script (Table 3), and then a new required item, “inherit technique,” and new quality 
element, “Technique inheritance,” are identified. Furthermore, these items are asso-
ciated with the practical goal “cost reduction of utility work” (Figure 8).

Discussion 
In this paper, the facility construction and maintenance service is used as the example 
case. New requirements of the utility company were extracted. On the basis of the 
existing method, the requirements such as “lengthen service life of facilities and 
equipment” were identified to achieve “cost reduction.” On the other hand, in this 
 

74 
K. Ota et al. 
 
paper, the driving force influencing the requirement structure of the utility company is 
identified, and then the requirement “inherit technique” is additionally extracted. 
Thus, a concrete requirement item is identified while considering the future occur-
rence of cost escalation. On the basis of this requirement, the service designer can 
take variable environmental factors into consideration in the design. 
By using service scenario planning, the service designer can analyze the business 
environment of a client company from the place of service provider. However, it is 
not easy to minutely analyze environmental factors in terms of costs and volume of 
information. Thus, an easily applicable supporting method will be required. Concrete-
ly, supporting an association between environmental factors and goals in Step 2, and 
the evaluation index of impact and uncertainty in Step 3, are required.

Conclusion 
This paper proposes a supporting method that service designers can use when  
building their service strategies, to help consider environmental factors and grasp 
customers’ potential requirements. To achieve this purpose, the requirement analysis 
template is integrated with the scenario planning methodology, which is a method 
used to consider environmental factors for business strategy planning. Future work 
includes identifying a method for validating the identified customer’s requirements, 
and a supporting method to help the service designer easily apply the service scenario 
planning.

Abstract. In both, service and manufacturing industries, customer participation 
in design and formulation is promoted as a way to add value. Experts, providing 
services and products, construct the relationship between customer require-
ments and the function of services and products. Subsequently, they design their 
offerings based on this relationship. In case customers participate in the design 
process, they have to design products and services like experts though they have 
lesser knowledge. This study defines customer expectation as a substitute for 
the lack of design knowledge among customers and aims to encourage partici-
patory design. For instance, this study examines customer expectation of the 
tourism service in Tokyo. Tourists were surveyed to gauge what they consi-
dered important when planning their travel. The difference between the results 
of analysis of Japanese and foreign tourists suggests that the relationship be-
tween the domains depends on customers’ knowledge and experiences.  
Keywords: expectation, design, knowledge.

Introduction 
The attendance of customers during the manufacturing process of products and 
services is called customer involvement. Customer involvement in production and 
consumption has been discussed on simultaneity; one of the characteristics of the 
service [1]. Recently, customer involvement is used for adding value to products and 
services. In the previous research on customer involvement [1], Iven showed the 
effect of customer involvement on the design system. However, there are few studies 
on supporting customer involvement. In this study, we propose a methodology to 
support customers’ designing services based on customers’ interpretation in design. 
The challenges towards building the methodology are as follows: 
 
Clarifying the features of design by customers 
 
Constructing the system to support design by customers based on the features 
This paper adapts the design methodology proposed for experts to design by 
customers. In section 2, previous studies about design methodology are explained.

In section 3, customers expectation is introduced to represent the difference between 
experts and customers on design and the importance of supporting design by 
customers based on expectation is described. With the case of tourism service, the 
design by customers is analyzed, in section 4. Section 5 concludes with the result of 
analysis and future works as the next step of this research.

Design by Customers 
2.1 
Previous Study: Methodology in Engineering Design 
As shown in Fig.1, the design process is the operational concept to derive a design 
solution from design specifications [2]. In general design, design knowledge 
represents design objects and design processes. 
 
Fig. 1. Representation of the design process [2] 
In design methodology ([3], for example), customer requirements for products and 
services are mapped to the function of products and services that fulfill these 
requirements and their function is mapped to attributes that reveal the function. Fig.2 
illustrates this methodology. 
Mapping between the regions in Fig.2 is equivalent to the operation concept as 
shown in [2]. Mapping connects elements of different domains and depends on the 
designers’ interpretation of the products and services they are trying to create.

2.2 
Design by Customers on the Design Methodology 
The designing process of experts is described in Section 2.1, which requires an 
understanding of the design process and design knowledge to comprehend. On the 
other hand, most customers do not have specialized knowledge and experience about 
products and services. As a result, those customers’ own knowledge is not enough to 
interpret the relationship among design domains. The lack of knowledge has been 
important issue on customer involvement because it causes the increase of conflict in 
design[4]. However, even in case of customers with insufficient knowledge, as long 
as the design is completed, some mapping is determined with interpretation of 
products and services. 
The characteristic of the design by customers appears as the factor that helps 
customers to interpret service instead of design knowledge. This study introduces 
customers expectation as this factor. In the next section, the reason for introducing 
expectations is described.

Customers Expectation 
3.1 
Expectation in Previous Research 
Evaluation by customers is one of the most important issues in studies of service 
industries. Therefore customer satisfaction has become an important evaluation index. 
Customer expectations are asserted as a reference of customer satisfaction. For 
instance, the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) [5] cited customer 
expectation as one of the factors related to customer satisfaction among others such as 
perceived quality and customer loyalty. 
In [6], customer expectations are classified into three types based on the differenc-
es in their characteristics: 
 
Desired service 
Desired service “reflects what customers want.” 
 
Adequate service 
Adequate service is “the standard that customers are willing to accept.” 
 
Predicted service 
Predicted service is “the level of service customers believe is likely to occur.” 
Desired service is the standard of relative advantage of the services perceived by 
customers, adequate service plays the role of indicating the validity of the service, and 
predicted service acts as the standard of customer satisfaction [6]. 
3.2 
Expectation and Interpretation of Services 
For experts of products and services, their design knowledge is the criterion for 
evaluating and determining the process of design. On the other hand, customers have 
insufficient design knowledge. As a result, the criteria for design depend on demand

Contents of Analysis 
This study investigated Free Individual Travelers (FIT) in the Japanese metropolitan 
area. Design by customers in the tourism service is the planning of travel by FIT, 
while design by experts is the creation of the package tour. Customer requirements, 
the process of design (planning), and the itinerary as the final result of design are easy 
to observe in tourism services. Tourism services are expected to contribute to eco-
nomic growth and attracting tourists; not only domestic (Japanese, in this case) travel-
ers but foreign travelers too, is the immediate challenge. Therefore, the methodology 
of this research has significance for the specific field of tourism. Addition to this, by 
generalize the case of tourism service, the result of analysis and the methodology can 
contribute to other services and PSS. 
The questionnaire of investigation asked tourists about their objectives in three 
phases of tour; when they planned their travel, before departure from their residence 
and during their time in Japan. With the data from the investigation, the relationship 
between customer expectations and psychological distance was analyzed. “Psycholog-
ical distance is a subjective experience that something is close or far away from the 
self, here, and now”[7]. The result of the analysis suggested that customer expecta-
tions vary with psychological distance.  
Smith’s tourism products [8] lists the essential elements of the tourism service. In 
[7], Smith defined tourism from the viewpoint of the providers who design tourism 
products. Table 1 shows the elements of the tourism service and their categories. The 
categories are subdivided to represent customers’ recognition of the services. The 
numbers in Table 1 represent categories. Configuration of the elements and categories 
was carried out with the help of an expert at a travel agency in Japan.

Elements in Table 1 correspond to elements in the functional area (Fig.2) and 
represent the functions of tourism in the metropolitan area. Therefore, tourists res-
ponses to the questionnaire represent how tourists’ requirements were mapped to the 
functional domain in participatory design. By a principal component analysis for the 
combination of emphasized elements, the structure of functional elements of tourists’ 
design is analyzed. Based on principal component obtained by the analysis, tourists 
are classified and the patterns of tourists’ expectation for tourism are extracted. From 
these patterns, the mapping between functional domain and customer domain is  
discussed. 
Domestic (Japanese) tourists and foreign tourists were studied separately. 515 data 
samples were collected for domestic tourists using Macromill, an online research 
company. investigation on foreigners were conducted in two hotels in Tokyo and 117 
data samples were collected. 
4.2 
The Principal Components of Function 
One tourist’s answer to the questionnaire is converted into one dataset. Principal 
component analysis was conducted separately on datasets of Japanese participants and 
those of foreign participants. Fig.4 shows an example of a main component. The ele-
ments are shown on the left of the vertical axis and the horizontal axis indicates the 
score of each element. Fig.4.(a) is the first principal component of domestic partici-
pants. [Museums, Industrial sightseeing], [Natural scenery, Appreciating the four 
seasons], [History, Traditional scenery, Temples/shrines] and [Downtown areas, Ci-
tyscapes] get the highest score among the components. Oh the other hand, Fig.4.(b) 
shows that the score of [Public transit], [Lodgings], [Food] and [Shopping] is highest 
in the first principal component of foreign participants.

The elements which score high on the principal components are shown in Table 2. 
“P” means positive scores and “N” means negative scores in Table 2. 
Table 2. Elements that score high on the principal components 
 
On the result of analyses of Japanese participants, elements that score higher in one 
principal component belong to one category. On the other hand, the principal compo-
nents of foreign tourists include elements from multiple categories. 
Based on these elements, the meaning of each principal component is interpreted 
as shown in Table 3. For the principal components of domestic tourists, each compo-
nent corresponds to one category and thus the meaning can be the same as the catego-
ry. The first principal component of foreign tourists includes basic elements of trip, 
and thus the word, “Travel”, means the aspect of tour to be realized, in contrast, 
“Type of sightseeing” includes the enjoyable elements of tourism.

Classification of Tourists Based on the Scores for Principal Components 
Based on the scores for the principal components extracted in 4.2, the expectations of 
foreign tourists were classified. Classification was limited to the first five principal 
components based on the value of eigenvalue. Eigenvalue is one of the main index 
that indicates the importance of the principal component. K-means clustering 
methodology is chosen as the method of classification. K-means clustering is a non-
hierarchical approach to classify data into a certain number of clusters. This paper 
divides the results of classification into 3 clusters. As shown in Table 2, the features 
of each cluster include the elements that are emphasized and the customer attributes

Cluster 3 
Positive : 1st “Travel”

Cluster 1 gets high negative scores on the second principal component and tends to 
focus on [Travel Experiences] and [Sightseeing and Hospitality]. This cluster has 
many travelers from North America. 
In cluster 2, the second principal component scores positive and the third principal 
component scores negative. The tourists in cluster 2 focus on concrete sightseeing 
spots like [Museums・Industrial sightseeing] and [Downtown areas・Cityscapes] and 
not on elements like [Local guidance] and [Local tours] that assist in determining 
where to go. In this cluster, many travelers belong to neighboring areas, such as Hong 
Kong and Taiwan. 
In cluster 3, the first principal component scores highly and tourists in cluster 3 fo-
cus on “Transit, Accommodation, etc.” In this cluster, tourists have experience of 
international travel and this is their first visit to Japan. They planned only to realize 
the tour. They didn’t take what to enjoy in planning into account and considered it 
after coming to Japan.

Discussions 
On Principal Component Analysis: Categories are summarized as functions of 
tourism service from the perspective of professionals in this industry. Therefore, it is 
considered that the interpretation by Japanese tourists is close to that of experts,

where the compatibility of one principal component with one category is concerned. 
On the other hand, in the results of the analyses of foreign participants, the 
correspondence between the category and the principal component is partial and the 
unity of elements, as a result of interpretation, is different from the experts’. 
Difference of the principal components is the difference of the structure of the 
functional elements for each party of Japanese and foreign tourists. Thus, if customers 
with the typical characteristics of each population were to design the tourism package 
on the basis of the same request, a different solution will appear.  
On Clustering: Clusters are classified by principal component scores and are divided 
by the differences in their requirements and the mapping to function. Focusing on the 
attributes of each cluster, bias in country of residence and travel experience is 
observed, as described above. Consider the cluster that is skewed on customer 
attributes; those attributes are important to correspond with tourists based on the 
diversity in design of tourism. By further analyzing the differences in requirements 
and mapping them on design, more individualized correspondence can be achieved. 
For example, contents of the services can be changed based on attributes such as 
customer country of residence and information can be provided to compensate for the 
lack of travel experience and to assist in the formation of expectation. 
For domestic tourists, because of similarity of function tree, the support for design 
should be similar to that for experts basically and, to support the mapping among 
domains, providing information about correspondence of requirements to functions 
will be the additional support. For the foreign tourists in cluster 1 and cluster 2, the 
support to their planning tour at their country is effective to correspond to their diver-
sity. As mentioned in section 3, function of services will be classified and structured 
based on the components such as types of sightseeing and the support such as “pro-
viding knowledge that customers lack” is provided to customers. However, tourists in 
cluster 3 design their tour without reflecting their requirement at their country but 
reflect it after coming Japan. This suggests that another support to correspond to their 
diversity is necessary in Japan.

Conclusion 
This paper aims to develop a methodology to support customers’ participation in 
service design. In the case study of tourism service in the Japanese metropolitan area, 
a principal component analysis of the data of elements emphasized in planning tour is 
done, separately for Japanese tourists and foreign visitors. In addition, foreign tourists 
are classified based on the scores of principal component. The results suggest that to 
correspond to the diversity with the methodology, some attributes can be the index for 
develop the methodology. Especially, some suggestions can be adapted to other 
services directly, for example the diversity by experience of service and the phase of 
process when customers reflect their requirement to service. Further analysis is 
needed in the areas of customer requirements and actual tourist behavior to clarify and 
improve the methodology of incorporating customers’ service design.

Abstract. In the vision of Product-Service Systems (PSS) there is anticipation 
on stakeholders to develop sound networks to enable and support innovative 
product and service solutions. As such PSS business relationships could be 
viewed as innovation systems. The challenge to find appropriate and relevant 
stakeholders is commonly mentioned in manufacturing industry as a difficult 
task. This paper elaborates on such a challenge, but has put an emerging indus-
try as a frame of interest in order to discuss the progress of a innovation system 
which has the purpose to inspire product and service development based on 
commercial human space flights. Some managerial implications for PSS inno-
vation system development are made, for example it is suggested to implement 
a learning environment as a “demonstrator” from which an innovation system 
can evolve.  
Keywords: innovation systems, collaboration, development processes, net-
works, space tourism.

Introduction 
The change in industry from selling standalone goods to the delivery of a solution has in 
recent years proven interesting for many companies, yet such a change in organizational 
structure and individual capabilities imply a multitude of implications for implementing 
PSS [1]. Manufacturing industry has a long history and established routines of develop-
ing and selling physical goods, e.g. a transaction-based business idea. Services are seen 
as a means to keep the core goods operating, as for example maintenance to keep a ma-
chine running or training to know how to use it. Representatives from the manufacturing 
industry segment has already experienced and identified the number one challenge, 
namely that both an adjustment in organizational structure and in individual capabilities 
are depending on a change in mindset of all stakeholders [2].  
Vargo and Lusch [3] have stressed that product development and service 
development are based on two totally different logics, and question if those can be 
managed simultaneously. Commonly, firms that develop and manufacture technical 
solutions regard services as after market activities [4]. Hence, services are developed 
after the goods have been produced and do not influence the technical design. While a 
common underpinning feature of PSS is an integration of the two different rationales,

product and service, as early as possible in the product development process. In 
particular, the contradictory rationales between product and service development 
indicate a necessary paradigm shift for manufacturing firms when turning towards 
PSS businesses. So far, this is a grand challenge for manufacturing industry where 
thinking, doing and processes are established and grounded in an engineering 
tradition. But, what about a new emerging, and thus immature, industry? What kind of 
challenges will it meet? Will there be different conditions for emerging innovation 
systems in comparison with the established ones?  
In recent years, commercial human spaceflight has emerged as a growing industry. 
New technology and spacecrafts are being developed, primarily by private companies 
and entrepreneurs, aiming to increase access to space, for tourism, research, educa-
tion, product demonstration and launch of small satellites, into low Earth orbit and 
beyond [5]. The opportunity for common people to travel into space was defined by 
the Ansari X PRIZE [6], a competition set in 2004 to incentivize and spur the devel-
opment of the first non-government organization to launch a reusable manned space-
craft into space. This worked to demonstrate that spaceflight could be affordable and 
accessible to corporations and civilians, opening the door to commercial human 
spaceflight.  
Since then the industry has seen a rapid development where a number of 
entrepreneurs and private companies, Virgin Galactic [7], XCOR [8], Armadillo 
Aerospace Sierra Nevada Corporation [9] to name but a few, are developing and 
testing new technology and space launch system aiming to increase access to space. 
On October 7, 2012, the first official commercial mission to resupply the International 
Space Station was launched by the private company SPACEX [10], founded by the 
entrepreneur Elon Musk [11]. 
In the early stages of commercial human spaceflights, the focus was on technical 
requirements, to prove that it was doable. However, it was soon realized that the 
project was not purely technical. Focusing on commercial manned spaceflight and 
space tourism, as a totally new industry, it has to encompass a wide range of different 
competences, e.g. from designing infrastructure, develop the space experience, and 
innovate appropriate outfits to understanding health issues. Thus, not only involve 
mechanical engineers, but all kinds of expert domains. In this evolving industry, a 
different mindset for how to combine product and service solutions is already 
established and applied.  
Globally, space tourism is only the tip of an iceberg in this second space age. New 
companies are being established as well as new research and education. Governments 
and companies worldwide are currently mobilizing to capitalize on the opportunities 
that the second space age will bring in terms of economic growth, job creation and 
inspire young people to pursue careers in the field contributing to regional attraction 
enabling both regions and companies to grow and build for the future [12].  
The Swedish organization Spaceport Sweden [12] is a pioneering initiative to 
establish commercial human spaceflight and space tourism in Sweden and is guided 
by a vision to become a world leading spaceport and Europe’s first and foremost 
portal to space. Yet, a vision to provide space experiences in a more holistic way 
guides the work. In order to capitalize on the interest and potential of this new 
industry, Spaceport Sweden recognizes the need for new ideas and development of

innovative experiences, services, and processes to create long-term economic growth. 
As such, Spaceport Sweden forms the core of an innovation cluster or innovation 
system, aiming to inspire people to start new companies and see the development of 
new innovative services and experiences. A key interest for this paper is to 
conceptualize what can be learnt from the advancement of a new industry to support 
evolving Product-Service System (PSS) organizations. More exactly, the purpose of 
this paper is to draw from the Spaceport Sweden case and reframe those lessons 
learned into innovation and collaboration aspects of PSS.

Methodology 
At the heart of an emerging market is the fact that all stakeholders are not known, 
meaning that studies of that market is not readily done. This is one reason for this 
study to apply a conceptual approach, where data are qualitative and mainly acquired 
from theory. In particular, literature from the innovation and entrepreneurial know-
ledge domains are used. Spaceport Sweden is affiliated as a live case in the research 
project, from which lessons could be learnt on for instance how innovation systems 
can act as a platform for not only regional, but also national and international growth. 
Subsequently, inspires start up companies in all kinds of fields. Data are planned to be 
longitudinal, i.e. will be acquired over time. The study presented here will apply a 
more experimental and conceptual approach to elaborate on possible stakeholders and 
opportunities for a PSS rationale to govern new companies development processes.  
First, Spaceport Sweden is shortly introduced and a number of key challenges are 
presented. Second, a presentation of the perspective of innovation systems and PSS 
will be done. Third, a stakeholder view is discussed before ending the paper with a 
concluding remark.

Spaceport Sweden – The Live Case   
A live case is a new approach in the research project; a live case can be compared to 
an on-going real situation, which has the purpose to provide interaction and thus col-
laborative learning. A key interest for the whole project is innovation systems and 
different aspects in relation to this, this study focus on an emerging innovation system 
and its actors. Spaceport Sweden [12], situated in the north of Sweden in the city Ki-
runa, provides input acting as the live case. 
The Swedish Minister for Enterprise and Energy inaugurated Spaceport Sweden 
[12] in 2007. Partners to the organization are a government initiated investment 
company [13], a tourist company [14], two mountain resort companies [15],[16], and 
a venture cap company [17]. Spaceport Sweden will supply launch infrastructure, 
R&D facilities and high-tech expertise to commercial space operators, services to 
companies and academia as well as unique world-class experiences to a global 
market. Spaceport Sweden’s mission is to develop learning space experiences on the 
ground, in the air and, in time, in space. Currently, the organization is offering 
commercial flights into the northern lights, as its first space adventure.

The city Kiruna has a tradition in innovative aviation that started already in 1916, 
when the biplane model Albatross was tested in the area. Kiruna is Europe’s premier 
space city since 1957, home to the Swedish Institute of Space Physics as well as 
Esrange Space Center, managed by SSC [18] and established as the European launch 
site for research rockets and stratospheric balloons. Sweden saw its first rocket launch 
in 1961 and has since developed world-renowned capability and experience, and a 
comprehensive infrastructure has been built up to support aerospace operations. 
Moreover, Kiruna is also host to Arena Arctica [19], as 5,000 square meters hangar 
which was inaugurated in 1990 at Kiruna Airport suitable for both space related 
research activities as well as serving as a proving ground in sub-arctic environment. 
Such testing activities also have a long tradition and for example the Swedish Air 
Force did the first test in the Kiruna region in 1924. Luleå University of Technology is 
also present in Kiruna, offering two space master programs and one upper secondary 
school for students wishing to combine their interest for science with skiing the winter 
resort of Kiruna.  
Kiruna’s geographical location up in the north of Sweden provides large unpopu-
lated areas and offers unique possibilities. A main advantage is that Kiruna offers a 
free airspace and with minimal amount of commercial airline traffic over an area 
equivalent to about an eight of Sweden’s total land area. Also, the unspoilt nature and 
sub-arctic climate offers unique possibilities to develop attractive tourism services, for 
example cross-country and alpine skiing, trekking and fishing. Moreover, tourism 
services also offer people to learn more about the world’s largest iron ore mine, or the 
Sami, indigenous people of Lapland. The world famous hotel built from pure ice, the 
ICEHOTEL [14], is also situated here.  
The city Kiruna was founded just over 100 years ago due to the rich findings of 
iron ore in the area where mining and related activities have been the main focus of 
the town. However, the ore goes underneath the city and will in a short future cause 
problems, so this has led to the necessity to actually move the central town from its 
current site to another site nearby. This is not only a unique and challenging task, but 
also seen as an opportunity to redesign a new city to fit contemporary industries and 
interests.  
Guiding principles for the emerging innovation models should be to develop eco-
nomical, environmental and social sustainable business models and products. As a 
pioneering initiative there are several challenges for this kind of emerging industry 
and businesses, one key challenge is that the structure and network of the innovation 
system has to emerge based on local capabilities but for an international viable busi-
ness. Inherent in such a challenge is to identify, attract and assign relevant ac-
tors/stakeholder as co-developers of the innovation system. Another challenge for 
Spaceport Sweden is to drive the development of a creative space or a multicenter, i.e. 
a physical place where both space and the mining industry provide a platform for 
cross-industry innovation, research and education, but also for adventure and enter-
tainment. Such physical site makes the experiences accessible for all kinds of actors 
and could become a hub for regional growth. Yet another challenge for Spaceport 
Sweden is related to the mission of being a catalyst for regional development. Initial-
ly, inspiration to startup companies within, tourism and creative industries, as fashion, 
events, music, and food, are in focus. That is, Spaceport Sweden, as an innovation 
system, seeks to encourage entrepreneurship among a vast segment of actors.

Innovation Systems 
A common way to describe innovation systems is as a network of actors who has an 
aligned goal, for example to take a new idea to a market. Hence, as such it becomes 
an innovation system. For example, Lundvall [20] p.2, state that “…a system of inno-
vation is constituted by elements and relationships which interact in the production, 
diffusion and use of new, and economically useful knowledge […] and are either lo-
cated within or rooted inside the borders of a nation state”. The mechanism of devel-
oping innovation systems or innovation networks can be intentional or unintentional, 
nonetheless the stakeholders that constitutes the system act in order to realize a solu-
tion that cannot be developed in solitude. By this need to bring in external knowledge, 
innovation systems are based on an open innovation approach [21].  
Product-service systems (PSS) are suggested to be defined as the result of an “in-
novation strategy” [22], since the core is a shift from only developing and selling 
physical products to also designing and provide services, which integration are capa-
ble to fulfill specific customer requirements. A PSS vision is suggested to rely on this 
innovation perspective, and also to rests upon two main pillars [1]. First, PSS devel-
opment should always take the standpoint to develop functionally or fulfillment of the 
user’s/customer’s goal, this should be in opposite to starting from a solution based on 
a sole physical artifact. Second, the focus on sustainable solutions should permeate all 
business relationships, meaning that the existing structures and/or the companies’ 
position within those structures should not be taken for granted. Instead, these should 
be continuously negotiated. Basically, PSS aligns with innovation systems, or com-
petitive business networks that should co-produce added value to its customers [23] 
Also, the idea of distributed property rights is part of the PSS vision [24] and means 
that PSS stakeholders have to create channels in the network to share information and 
build a joint knowledge base of core innovation capabilities, in opposite to monitor, 
control and prevent collaboration. Typically, in innovation systems the stakeholders 
are obliged to both cooperate and compete, i.e. the work can be described as coopeti-
tion [25]. This is in contradiction to a traditional value chain structure, where the  
actors take responsibilities to develop one “part” each and the main stakeholder as-
sembly all pieces to a final product. In value chain collaboration, the main stakeholder 
provides the leading channel to customers.  Customers, users, end-users etcetera can 
be part of an innovation system, and this could explain some of the focus on such 
collaboration in PSS development. 
An innovation system depends on an adequate critical mass of stakeholders for the 
system to survive and prosper. The geographical distribution is commonly of impor-
tance and the system is often referred to as regional or national [26]. Further, the dis-
tribution depends on the homogeneous set-up that a region gives, while this is not the 
case for larger areas, e.g., national innovation systems. An investigation has shown 
that stakeholders within a community, or innovation system, develop specific forms 
of capital, e.g. social relations, norms, values and interactions [26]. Such capital is 
then used to reinforce capabilities related to innovation and competitiveness [26]. 
Recently, a shift in research focus has occurred, now not only the stakeholders in a 
network are of interest but also how the links between them perform [27]. Within this 

90 
Å. Ericson, J. Wenngren, and K. Nilsdotter 
 
perspective the notion of a “learning environment” is of utmost importance for overall 
performance, thus the innovation system could also be referred to as networks of 
learning [28]. 
The use of Internet and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are 
an important vehicle for building and maintaining innovation systems, and such they 
“remove” regional borders and summon new actors. Also, they are predicted to play a 
key role in the development of new services and products, for example Gartner Inc. 
[29] predicts that by 2014 as many as 25 percent of new business applications will be 
built by ‘citizen developers’ [29]. 
The innovation processes as such differs from how they are conducted in mature 
industries, from this point of view innovation often follows, or at least is described as, 
an established gated process. Commonly, ordinary day-to-day product development is 
not separated from an innovation process. On the same token, the direction towards a 
strictly technical innovation process might occur. In other innovation systems more 
entrepreneurial ventures are conducted within the processes. Thereby, the process is 
less defined, but more flexible. A key concern in such entrepreneurial innovation 
systems is that it is seldom obvious where the idea comes from [30]. On an overarch-
ing macro level, the innovation process starts with an identified need [31] or an idea 
and the whole innovation system is leveraging their knowledge and capabilities to 
bring out commercial products and services. Typically several individual stakeholders 
have contributed to the development of different products and services, or to the same 
product or service. Further, stakeholders that do not contribute to the actual develop-
ment processes are instead supporting other stakeholders in the innovation system, 
e.g. banks and venture capitalists.  
5 
A Stakeholder View 
To increase the implementation of innovations and encourage startup companies, the 
government investments are commonly done to support an innovative and entrepre-
neurial industry sector. Typically, to create regional growth the approach is to inspire 
new actors by, for example funding their production in the region or to create industry 
specific clusters to support transfer of know-how and experiences. Thus, homogene-
ous and specific networks of stakeholders emerge. If problematizing such an approach 
it can be, on one hand, argued that it might be difficult for heterogeneous businesses, 
like PSS, to enter or to work in such innovation systems. On the other hand, a vast 
array of different stakeholders might not be able to contribute to the innovation sys-
tem and its purpose. An identified key question is to identify what conditions that 
must thus be in place for various stakeholders to actively contribute in the innovation 
system. 
In Figure 1, stereotype examples of stakeholders are described as well as it is indi-
cated that they might have different motivations to contribute in the system. For  
example the initiator locates a need, an idea or a problem situation and initiates the 
innovation activities. A typical initiator stakeholder could be an inventor that has an

contribute in the innovation system. In comparison, a PSS structure could also be seen 
from a macro level where extended enterprises and new practices of collaboration are 
formed. In general, the macro level focus on benefits like win-win and gaining addi-
tional competences, while a micro level focus could highlight hinders and barriers for 
the individual stakeholders. In particular for heterogeneous innovation systems, not 
only as in the Spaceport Sweden case but also as in PSS, there seem to be a need to 
visualize the motivational aspects for each type of stakeholder. This can make not 
only extrinsic motivation visible, but also the intrinsic motivation for contribution in 
the innovation system can be clarified. 
6 
Concluding Remark 
This paper is based on an empirical case where an emerging industry has served as 
inspiration to discuss innovation systems within the conceptual framework of PSS 
collaboration. In particular, the discussion was aimed to draw some lessons learned 
useful for PSS organizations. We have found that heterogeneous innovation systems, 
or PSS collaborations, might be a sound platform for product and service integration. 
However, a main concern is to further elaborate on each stakeholder’s motivation, 
extrinsic as well as intrinsic, for contributing in the innovation system. In successful 
systems, all stakeholders benefit from the interchange and the vision of PSS collabo-
ration as being based on win-win is already established [32]. However, it would be a 
good effort to implement demonstrators of innovation systems to learn from, as for 
example the live case reported on in this paper. 
In general, our research within the PSS field indicates that taking the first step to-
wards PSS collaboration is not straightforwardly done. The case company presented 
in this paper is not “biased” in terms of having an established background in manufac-
turing industry, though commercial human spaceflights include space shuttles that are 
high-tech and highly complex products, which mean that manufacturing industry will 
be part of this kind of innovation system. Hence, the Spaceport case will be followed 
in future studies. Also research on implicit and explicit PSS development [33] seems 
relevant and interesting.

Abstract. This paper proposes production patterns for web services to provide a 
standard procedure to assess and optimize the production processes.  The pat-
terns consist of design models in each of design, implementation, test and oper-
ation phase, and models of practitioners' tasks and activities through a service 
lifecycle.  These two models are linked together and stored into a repository, 
and they form patterns of service production.  The patterns can give a frame of 
co-creating services, and it will be used as a template for service production as 
well as a yardstick to keep track of production progress.  A conceptual verifica-
tion shows that the progress of practitioners' activities can be assessed and the 
total lifecycle cost of the service can also be estimated, enabling administrators 
to perform better production management and decision making. 
Keywords: production patterns, agile development, critical chain for services, 
lifecycle cost, PSS for cloud-compliant web services.

Introduction 
Service oriented architecture (SOA) [1] has introduced flexibility to web services, 
adapting to changes in business environment quickly.  The SOA will be attained 
through a series of web service technologies [2] - standardized design interfaces and 
development methods for waterfall-based development.  However, all the clients' 
requirements for web services cannot be determined at the early phase of develop-
ment as the pace of change has accelerated these years.  These changes require an 
adjustment for the integration of web services from traditional waterfall-based ways 
to a rather agile style, which develops prototypes of web service continuously while 
acquiring surfaced requirements.  This new paradigm entails service integrators to 
change their development mindset from product-oriented to service-oriented one; the 
value of clients' services arises not from the scale or quality of systems' functions but 
from immediate improvements in their business.  Therefore, the involvements of 
practitioners' activities have become more significant, and the integrators are required 
to co-create clients' services through a number of hypothetical prototyping conti-
nuously.  To deal with such environments, activities and their deliverables in each 
development phase should be managed comprehensively.

Design and Operation Patterns 
To assist continuous prototyping with hypothetical verifications, the authors have 
proposed service model chains [3], which is developed under the service design and 
operation framework [Appendix: Service Lambda for Cloud Computing].  A service 
model chain consists of a set of deliverables in a development process.  It can be 
developed by the continuous design and operation tools of the framework: service 
objectives, value chain, goal prioritization, service system design, quality-function 
insight, application use case, resource combination design, application prototyping, 
and application execution.  While a major concern for a service production, such as 
design-centered development, implementation-centered development, or lifecycle-
centered management, have taken into definite forms, the service domain can be  
determined, and an appropriate tool set is specified from the tool chain.  Then, a 
service model chain, which represents a pattern of design and operation for the do-
main, is established with the selected tool chain.  The service design and operation 
patterns are stored into the shared service repository - public service portfolio, and 
service integrators are encouraged to reuse and customize these assets for another 
service production by importing them as templates to each project's repository - pri-
vate service portfolio.  With these mechanisms, the service model chains can bring a 
solution of mass customization to productions of cloud-compliant web services. 
However, this service model chain is not sufficient to administrate service produc-
tions, as it lacks the interactions between stakeholders, i.e. practitioners and users, 
through a service lifecycle.  The traditional development can be regarded as product-
oriented, and service model chains are enough to improve service productions as the 
development is bound to software/hardware products' specifications and behavior.  
However, the development of cloud-compliant web service has characteristics of ser-
vices, as negotiations between practitioners account for a higher proportion than com-
posing software and hardware functions of cloud platforms.  These practitioners' 
interactions would rise and fall, while the clients' requirements have developed.  
Then, tasks will become varied and it will be hard to administrate.  To clarify man-
agement of such practitioners' tasks in product and service developments, the next 
section discusses project management approaches, which give a form of practitioners' 
activities. 
3 
Task Management in Production Process 
Project management methods are approaches to explicitly handle practitioners' activi-
ties in product and/or service productions.  This section contemplates two notable 
approaches - Critical Path and Critical Chain, and discusses how these methods can 
apply to production processes and how they should be extended to exploit characteris-
tics in service productions.   
3.1 
Critical Path 
Critical path [4] is a project management approach to identify one or more sequences 
of tasks, which will lead a project delay when a task in the sequence delays, and to 
manage the tasks to keep them on track.  A critical path consists of a group of tasks, 

 
Towards Establishing Production Patterns to Manage Service Co-creation 
97 
 
which have subordinate relationships - for example, task A should start after task B.  
All work in a production process is broken down to a collection of tasks - WBS (work 
breakdown structures).  All tasks in a production process are depicted in a PERT 
(program evaluation and review technique) chart, and then the shortest route between 
the beginning and ending tasks can be identified in the figure.  This route is the criti-
cal path in this production process.  For instance, the shortest route in Figure 1 is the 
sequence of nodes (tasks) whose floating time are zero; A, B, D and F.  With this 
chart, the total amount of production time and lead time are determined.  
 
Fig. 1. Critical path 
The critical path has been applied to a large scale project and it is aimed at optimiz-
ing complex schedules.  A task delay in the critical path causes a delay of total sche-
dule, and accelerating tasks to shorten the critical path reduces the total production 
time.  Accordingly, managing the critical path will be pursued in product produc-
tions.  However, this approach is unfitted to consider undetermined tasks, such as 
workers' psychology, behavior and social/organizational obstacles in a project. 
3.2 
Critical Chain 
Projects with undetermined tasks can be managed through a critical chain [5] (Figure 
2).  A critical chain considers how the total development period should be kept or 
shortened.  It contemplates workers' psychology, behavior, and social/organizational 
problems and enables to optimize project management comprehensively, such as 
scheduling, task execution and progress management. 
The traditional project management based on the critical path assumes that each 
task should be completed as scheduled.  Then, practitioners should try to secure 
buffering time not to extend the planned schedule with delays of their tasks.  How-
ever, this redundant schedule may cause a student syndrome leading to further delay 
or phenomena of Parkinson's Law [7] preventing poorly synchronized integration. 
To exclude such obstacles, the critical chain introduces project buffers and joint 
buffers.  These buffers are controlled not by practitioners but by project managers.  

98 
S. Hosono and Y. Shimomura 
 
Project buffers are defined at the position right after the end of critical path in a PERT 
chart, and joint buffers are placed at the position where a non-critical path joins the 
critical path, allowing latitude in project management.  Critical chain also takes ac-
count of resource contentions, which are frequently observed in delayed projects.  
For instance, a task cannot be started while the required resources are used by another 
task.  Whenever these tasks are not prioritized, it will cause further delays, requiring 
resource negotiation. 
The critical chain approach considers resource contentions at the early stage of 
scheduling.  When a resource contention occurs, it will become a bottleneck in a 
project.  As this approach is based on the theory of constraints (TOC) [9] aimed at 
maximizing the ability of bottlenecked tasks, the tasks competing for same resource 
will be prioritized to avoid overlapping these tasks for the best scheduling. 
In these ways, the critical chain approach differs from plans by the critical path man-
agement.  The critical chain seems appropriate for managing service production.  
However, the undetermined tasks are not unique features to service production, and the 
next section discusses how critical chain for services differs from that for products.  
 
Fig. 2. Critical chain 
3.3 
Critical Chain for Products and Services 
Critical chain for products (CCp) relies on physical resources and it depends on inter-
nal constraints.  Meanwhile, users' involvement and interactions are mainly engaged 
in service development.  Hence, the critical chain for services (CCs) has dependency 
on such external constraints.  Furthermore, the characteristics of CCs are noteworthy 
from different perspectives.  CCs allows more projects to be completed without in-
creasing staff.  Buffer penetration for CCs provides an ambiguous indicator of 
whether the project is on schedule.  Eliminating bad multitasking in CCs makes 
individuals more productive and less prone to burnout [8]. 
Similarly to CCp, CCs also addresses resource contention.  To put these prin-
ciples of CCs into practice, it is required to quantify the amount of each task and the 
relationships between tasks.  However, quantifying tasks in service productions in-
cludes a wider range of practitioners' activities, and each of activities has been ma-
naged by projects administrators and managers manually.  
To establish a standardized method to quantify and formally address these practi-
tioners' activities, the next section discusses how task chains can represent activities in 
conjunction with the service model chains.  These two model chains will give a 
structure to production processes for services and become templates for another ser-
vice production where agile development [9] has been adopted.

Production Patterns to Manage Service Co-creation 
4.1 
Task Chain 
Service is defined as an activity between a service provider and a service receiver to 
change the state of the receiver [10][11].  Service is composed of 'content' and 
'channel'. Service content directly changes the state of receivers.  Service channel is 
the device which indirectly contributes to the change of state of receivers, e.g. com-
munication, supply and amplification. 
The service content is to be divided further into a set of functions, and the channel 
is to be denoted as a flow of the functions.  The services, such as consulting, system 
planning, implementation, or monitoring IT platforms have functions.  The channels 
are in the form of meetings, e-mail, networks, etc.  From a lifecycle perspective, 
these functions and function flows exist not only in the operational phase of the ser-
vice but also in the phases of ahead or behind: plan, design, implementation, and  
improvement.  Development deliverables, such as requirement definition, system 
modeling and interface definition, will work as functions, and deliverables between 
stakeholders in production process will be flows of functions, i.e. 'channel'. 
In this way, the whole production process can be regarded as a system in which 
stakeholders in development processes deliver functions to others.  These relation-
ships can reflect a sequence of tasks between practitioners, and a structure of task 
chain is established (Figure 3).  Each task has task names as well as attributes, such 
as 'man-hour' to complete it. 
 
Fig. 3. Task chain 
This task chain can be regarded as an abstraction form of CCs, as it is not only a 
set of each task.  The CCs also abstracts feeding buffer, resource buffer, and project 
buffer.  The data linkage represents a sequence of tasks with resource contention, as 
they reflect optimized sequences of real tasks. 
4.2 
Production Pattern Development and Reuse 
By defining task chains in line with model chains, a complete production patterns can 
be established with the following steps. 
 
 

100 
S. Hosono and Y. Shimomura 
 
Step 1.  Development of Model Chains. 
Each service model is developed with corresponding design and operation tools [3].  
The developed service model forms structured data in an XML (eXtensive Markup 
Language) form.  The XML data are concatenated along the lifetime phases.  Fur-
thermore, each tag data in an XML is linked to a tag in the next phase on the basis of 
reference relationships.  As a result, a service model chain is formulated (Figure 4).  
 
Fig. 4. Service model chain 
Step 2.  Development of Task Chains. 
While developing service model chains, corresponding tasks to produce each deliver-
able, such as reviewing documents and implementing application software, are identi-
fied.  These tasks are structured and linked to corresponding parts in the service 
model chain.  Task sets in each development phase are also linked along with the 
production process (Figure 5).  The man-hour attributes in the task chain will be 
translated to costs of practitioners' resources in the next step. 
 
Fig. 5. Association between service model chain and task chain 
Besides, this man-hour value can be brought from project management tools, 
which issue task tickets with planned value and actual performance records of human 
resources.  These practitioners' resource data are integrated to the task chains.  
Then, a pair of model chain and task chain is stored into repositories as a production 
pattern for later use (Figure 6).

101 
 
 
Fig. 6. Production patterns 
Step 3.  Reuse of Production Patterns. 
Service portfolio will be the key to manage these production patterns efficiently.  
The service portfolio should consist of repositories for managing requirements, de-
sign, implementation, operational data and tasks for deliverables.  The portfolio 
should also manage the common and service-specific data separately.  Then, two 
extended portfolios are introduced; the public service portfolio is shared by any de-
velopment project and the private service portfolio is owned by each application pro-
vider (Figure 7).   
 
Fig. 7. Public and private service portfolios 
When a production pattern is developed, it is exported to the public service portfo-
lio after pruning off confidential data, minimizing anticipation that the core asset may 
have clients' specific data.  Then, production pattern can be used for another service 
development.  With this mechanism, a new project of service development can be 
started by importing it.  Service developers can start the web service production 
from the beginning, and they just customize the interfaces and attain the target web 
services.  In the same way, the second or after cycle in iterative/agile development 
can be started by importing a partial chain, which corresponds to the spectrum of the 
original pattern.  Therefore, the system integrators can achieve clients' requirements 
easily and quickly.  Furthermore, when the development cycle ends and it returns to 
the earlier phase for the next development cycle, the man-hour attribute in the partial 
chain can indicate the lifetime cost of the new development cycle.

Implementation 
To evaluate the feasibility of the steps in the previous section, a production process 
framework is implemented by enhancing the Service Lambda for Cloud Computing 
framework [Appendix].  This framework consists of service design editors, task 
management tools, repositories, and analytic tools, which identify similar production 
patterns from the repositories and identify the influenced part in the patterns  
(Figure 8). 
 
Fig. 8. Overview of production process framework 
This framework is applied to a cloud service infrastructure and environment - PaaS 
(platform as a service), and the productivity and manageability are evaluated by de-
veloping a typical cloud-compliant web service. 
5 
Case Study 
The feasibility of our approach is examined through developing a web service, which 
shows trends of newly-released web contents, such as new product information, from 
RSS feeds on websites.  The crawling module of the web service collects RSS feeds 
from websites.  The service runs alternatively, multi-threads or multi-nodes, based 
on its configuration rules.  While developing this web service, the production pattern 
is stored into the public service portfolio.  Then, a similar web service for other 
clients is developed in an agile development way as follows. 
Reuse of Production Patterns. 
The model chain and task chain are used as a standard process for web service devel-
opment.  When developers specify a target service to develop, the framework (Fig-
ure 8) finds a model chain and the corresponding task chain, which is similar to the 
target function from the public service portfolio, and imports them into a private ser-
vice portfolio and uses them as a base of web service development. 
After developing a prototype of web service, the development cycle circulates and 
returns to the earlier development phase, as the requirements for non-functional re-
quirements are updated.  For example, the requirement of its performance is updated 
to a higher level.  To follow this requirement change, the similar nodes/trees, which 

 
Towards Establishing Production Patterns to Manage Service Co-creation 
103 
 
correspond to the change is identified from the public service portfolio.  The identi-
fied whole/partial chains with task chains are used as a reference for a baseline of the 
next round development.  Using the man-hour attributes in the identified chains, the 
project owners can estimate the production cost of this development round and also 
evaluate the progress of development (Figure 9). 
 
Fig. 9. Reuse of partial production pattern 
Assessment of Production Progress. 
The reuse of production patterns can be extended for the entire development phases.  
While developing web services in this agile way, the frequent interactions between 
practitioners make assessing progress obscure.  Earned-value analysis [12] is a good 
way to assess production progress at the time of evaluation.  Through the earned-
value analysis, planned value (PV) is defined as the budget given at the evaluated 
date.  Actual cost (AC) is given as the cost that they actually used.  Earned value 
(EV) is determined by the date of measurement.  The value of PV, AC and EV can 
be deemed with the following equations: 
PV (planned value) = Σ (planned man-hours × a unit price) 
 (1)
AC (actual cost) = Σ (actual man-hours × a unit price) 
 (2)
EV (earned value) = Σ (planned man-hours × a unit price × progress rate) 
(3)
The values of PV, AC and EV are obtained through the initially determined data in 
the framework (Figure 8), such as project start date, estimated end date, the number of 
iteration time, and the estimated date to complete the cycle.  The value of EV at the 
time of assessment can be generated at any time during the service development as 

104 
S. Hosono and Y. Shimomura 
 
the data stored in the public service portfolio and the private service portfolio is al-
ways available.  With PV, AC, and EV, the production progress at the time of  
assessment and the expected completion date of each iteration development are visua-
lized (Figure 10).  In this use case, the production patterns give standard data for 
'estimated ending date' and 'required man-hour for the next development cycle', as the 
partial chain corresponding to the next cycle will provide past actual records of the 
production period and man-hours. 
As illustrated above, the model chain and task chain can be used for estimating 
lifetime and for decision making of investing to the service development.  The mod-
els retain a complete production process from the design to operation phases.  There-
fore, the assets of web service development can be reused and development on  
customization will become easier. 
 
Fig. 10. Assessment of Production Progress

Discussion 
The case study shows that the model chains have increased productivity and mana-
geability of service production.  As exemplified in the agile development, a reusable 
process is easily specified as the beginning of the spectrum is the start point of reusa-
ble models, and the spectrum can be easily imported to a private service portfolio for 
reuse.  Similar structures are identified through a graph tree matching algorithm, and 
appropriate chains stored in the repository are selected when a new service project 
starts.  In addition, the selected parts of chains are used to determine the influenced 
activities and estimate lifetime costs.   
On the other hand, the case study of earned value analysis shows that the progress 
of service production as of time is visualized.  The task model structures practition-
ers' activities and they are used for a standard for assessing the progress of cloud-
compliant web services.  Hence, the presented approach gives another solutions to 
lifecycle cost modeling and estimation in the researches on product-service systems 
(PSS) [13][14][15][16].

Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper proposes production patterns providing development principles for web 
services.  The patterns consist of design models and task models through a service 
lifecycle.  The task chains give a structure to sequences of tasks and resource coor-
dination between the tasks.  This data structure can be stored in a repository.  Then, 
they are reused as a template for service production as well as a yardstick to keep 
track of production progress.  A conceptual verification shows that the progress of 
practitioners' activities can be assessed and the total lifecycle cost of the service can 
also be estimated enabling administrators to perform better production management 
and decision making. 
However, the adequacy of each task model chain has been left for future work.  
As production procedures depend on each organizational culture, the future study 
extends consideration of such cultural background and identifies an appropriate buffer 
size for such environment.  The customization interfaces for task chains can be iden-
tified by introducing roles representing organization to task chains.  This mechanism 
will increase the accuracy of the CCs, and better co-creating services will be depicted 
clearly.  In addition, task chains in this paper focused on practitioners' tasks mainly 
as hardware and software resources are affluent from the cloud, and they are excluded 
from the attributes of task chains.  To apply this approach to general service devel-
opments, the presented approach should be extended to handle resources explicitly.

Abstract. An efficient and effective management of facilities requires consider-
ing all the product and services related to a building’s entire life at an early 
stage. The interdisciplinary Facility Management (FM) approach advocates ac-
cordant concepts and techniques with the intention to reduce the total costs of 
facilities. A successful FM needs to bring together several actors involved in 
planning and operating a facility in a network organization. The specification of 
information flows and coordination mechanisms between these actors is com-
plex, and in this paper we argue that reference models can speed-up this 
process. We elaborated more than 50 process models that uncover the interac-
tion in FM service networks through interviews and workshops with practition-
ers. This research-in-progress develops a reference model of the interactions  
between conventional construction enterprises and specific FM service provid-
ers based on this empirical data following an iterative research process.

Introduction 
Facilities are more and more seen as strategic resources and as also the costs for their 
planning, construction, operation and maintaining increased dramatically in the recent 
years enterprises require for a more active management of facilities [1-2]. The Facility 
Management (FM) discipline offers a holistic approach for all the commercial, tech-
nical, and infrastructural tasks related to the management of facilities [2]. FM Con-
sulting (FMC) is a service that wants to improve FM in two dimensions: economic 
efficiency and usability. First, FMC aims at increasing the run-time economic effi-
ciency of a facility as it suggests methods for assessing, analyzing, and balancing any 
related costs at an early stage. FMC takes a long-term perspective that includes a 

108 
A.-K. Averbeck et al.  
building’s conception, construction, maintaining, revitalization, and conversion or 
demolition [3-4]. In a FM project, the service-related costs in the operation phase 
account for a multiple of the construction costs. Most of these costs are fixed in the 
conception phase already, and it’s hard to modify them at later project stages. Second, 
each FM project is unique as facilities differ in terms of their required types of use, 
flexibility, materials, energetic and room-functional requirements. Different actors 
need to co-operate so that a facility with the desired properties can be achieved. The 
actors include the general planner, specialized construction consultants (e.g., for lo-
gistics and energy), the constructor, the architect, and the building company. All the 
involved together constitute a service network [5] with the intention to deliver the use 
of a facility as a service to a customer. In service networks, information exchange 
needs to be established between actors so that the individual actors’ tasks can be 
coordinated and joint decisions can be made efficiently [6]. Consequently, each time a 
FMC project is initiated, every actor needs to analyze which information it requires 
from others to fulfill his activities and which information about his own activities 
could or should be provided to other actors so that they can efficiently and effectively 
do their tasks. Establishing this information exchange is time consuming and thus 
expensive [7]. Observations from practice indicate that required information is often 
not exchanged or that information is not provided in the right form or quality [8-10].  
At this juncture, reference information models (“reference models” in brief) are a 
means for describing a class of relevant real-world phenomena on an abstract level 
[11], and they are designed for reuse to guide the design of other information models. 
For instance, the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a well-known reference model for 
IT service management [12]. Reference models often describe “best-practice” concep-
tual knowledge that is identified from the analysis of specific models such as a “refer-
ence business processes” that are identified from the study of several business 
processes as they are implemented in practice.  
In this paper we present the status-quo of a reference model for the information ex-
change in FM projects that strives to assist the formation of FMC service networks. 
We have documented more than 50 processes of enterprises that are engaged in tradi-
tional construction projects or FMC service networks using the conceptual modeling 
software tool FlexNet Architect [13-14]. Based on an analysis of these processes, we 
identify a corpus of well-established information exchanges that is the evidence we 
build our reference model upon. The reference model is intended to be of immediate 
utility for the practice of FM and FMC.  
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the re-
search background on information flow modeling and Information Logistics as well 
as related industry standards and guidelines. Section 3 presents the IT artifact con-
glomerate FlexNet Architect. Section 4 depicts the reference model development 
process. Section 5 outlines the status-quo of the reference model. Finally, section 6 
discusses implications and limitations and gives a brief summary and outlook.

Research Background and Related Work 
Information models have been used in previous literature to assist the identification and 
documentation of information flows; for instance when analyzing the requirements for an 

 
Towards a Reference Model of Information Exchange and Coordination 
109 
integrated information processing for the technical and operational tasks in manufactur-
ing (Y-CIM) [15], for illustrating the information flows between different areas of opera-
tion in the retail business (e.g., between purchasing and warehouse) (Retail-H) [16], for 
creating a framework and reference processes that describe the daily operations of a con-
sulting company (Consulting C) [17], or for optimizing practices along industry supply 
chains (SCOR-model) [18]. However, in the context of construction projects that include 
facility services no such approach can be identified. 
Another strand of literature that analyzes inter-organizational information flows is 
subsumed under the term Information Logistics (IL). According to Winter et al. IL 
comprises the planning, execution, controlling, and monitoring of data flows as a 
whole between business areas or organizations as well as the storage and processing 
of data for decision support [19]. Whereas this definition emphasizes the importance 
of inter-organizational data flows in cross-company cooperation [20-21], it excludes 
further activities such as the data processing required for the automated execution of 
operational business processes [19]. Consequently, IL aims at providing relevant in-
formation in sufficient quality to a decision maker [19].  
Recommendations for organizing information exchange and coordination in FMC 
are also given by various regulations and industry standards. The Official Scale of 
Fees for Services by Architects and Engineers (HOAI) is an official German regula-
tion for the fees of architects and construction engineers that includes guidelines for 
dividing construction projects into certain phases. The German Facility Management 
Association (GEFMA) has released several drafts of guidelines that define the general 
role of FM, its scope with regard to services [22] and general instructions for a 
stronger integration of the documentation as a part of the life cycle oriented planning 
and maintaining of facilities [23].  
The Service Science literature and Service Management practice give further ad-
vices. For instance, in the context of service integration, a specification of IT system 
interfaces has been suggested [24] in order to facilitate information exchange between 
manufacturers and service providers in service networks: The industry standard DIN 
PAS 1091 gives detailed descriptions of such interfaces and the needed information 
flows between the participants of a service networks in the collaborative design, de-
velopment and offering of services.

Methodology 
3.1 
A Modeling Language for Information Flows in Service Networks 
We used a modeling language that particularly supports the documentation of 
processes, information flows, information objects, and coordination in service net-
work constellations [14] to represent and successively further develop our reference 
model.  Fig. 1 illustrates the main constructs of this modeling language by 
representing its meta-model in form of an Extended Entity Relationship Model 
(EERM). 

110 
A.-K. Averbeck et al.  
 
Fig. 1. Meta-model of the applied modeling language 
A project delimits the scope of analysis. Scenarios allow to represent different de-
velopment stages of a reference model and to conceptualize variants of a model, for 
instance if considering different network structures for a construction project such as 
a network with a general contractor or a full service contractor, respectively. 
A collaboration partner (actor) represents one of the producers and service provid-
ers that collaborate along the facility’s life cycle. The customer is also represented as 
an actor. Actors can be further detailed into divisions. A division is a logical unit that 
delimits an actor’s functional areas. Divisions can lend themselves to functional areas 
as they are prescribed in well-established industry frameworks such as the Y-CIM-
Model, the Retail-H-Model or the Consulting-C. Divisions subsume several activities 
that are associated to them. Process models can be used to describe the relations be-
tween activities. 
Collaborative activities connect activities of different actors, and they describe 
measures for aligning and coordinating these activities. Examples for collaborative 
activities range from redirections of information to the more complex aggregation of 
data and prescribing recommended procedures. Units allow bundling several colla-
borative activities. Process models, again, can be used for describing the relations 
between several collaborative activities that are associated to a common unit. In this 
context, a unit’s interface represents the information requirements of the included 
activities (input) and the information that is provided to other activities (output).  

 
Towards a Reference Model of Information Exchange and Coordination 
111 
Modules encapsulate units with respect to their contents. Modules also can lend them-
selves to established frameworks from industry (like the divisions can do). 
Finally, information flows allow for capturing the interaction between the divisions 
of different actors. An information flow represents information that is either provided 
by a division for further processing through collaborative activities or information that 
is received by the particular division. An information flow is used to exchange infor-
mation artifact types. In general, two types of information artifacts can be distin-
guished: a general information artifact type and an electronic business document. 
Whereas the general information artifact type can be interpreted as a proxy for a not 
further specified information object, an electronic business document allows the spe-
cification of the document’s structure by the definition and hierarchical organization 
of document fields, each of which is described by name, type and cardinality. Elec-
tronic business documents allow describing information objects that are exchanged 
between activities more precisely, and they define standards for the information  
exchange. 
3.2 
Reference Model Development 
We developed our reference model based on empirical data that was obtained in a 
series of interviews and workshops with practitioners. The development process 
orients on the iterative procedure model that was suggested by Carroll and Swatman 
[25] and Walsham [26] for the design of interpretative case studies (Fig. 2). Following 
this approach, an initial model (scenario) reflects the research group’s ex-ante state of 
knowledge. At the end of each research cycle, the model is questioned critically and 
new knowledge obtained about the research area is integrated into the model [25]. 
Consequently, the model serves two purposes. First, the reference model is the  
research result that encapsulates the elaborated domain knowledge and that is perma-
nently evaluated and questioned throughout the different research cycles. It is devel-
oped with the intention to finally help overcoming observed problems in practice. 
Second, the intermediate models documents the research progress of the researchers 
as they illustrate how the data collection process and the researchers’ understanding 
of the research domain evolved over time. 
This research yet traversed twice through the Carroll and Swatman model: in an 
exploratory and in a deepening phase. Further phases will follow. The main activities 
undertaken are listed below: 
1. Exploratory phase: Desktop research; development of a framework for the life 
cycle-oriented planning; definition and description of possible actors and their 
areas of operation; first steps towards the design of suitable collaborative activities 
and their realization with the FlexNet Architect, an internet platform that imple-
ments the previously described modeling language and thus supports the reference 
modeling process1

A.-K. Averbeck et al.  
2. Deepening phase: Capturing of the actor-specific processes for the accordant areas 
of operation on the basis of event-driven process chains (EPC) [27]; deriving and 
illustration of collaborative activities being relevant for a life cycle oriented plan-
ning; further description of the exchanged business documents and their structures 
Within each of these phases, a spiraled process guides the stepwise development and 
refinement of the reference model (Fig. 2): 
 
Fig. 2. Spiraled process of comprehension [25] 
• Each iteration starts with the identification of interview partners, addressing con-
tact persons and agreeing upon the methods used for the collection, recording and 
analysis of the data (Plan). 
• Subsequently, the data is collected (in interviews) and processed according to the 
agreed rules (Collect Data). 
• During the analysis, the raw data (in form of conversation records and documented 
adaptations of the model) are structured. Additionally, the data is reduced by con-
solidating the results in the FlexNet model as a new scenario (Analysis). 
• Finally, the resulting model is critically reflected. This review includes the decision 
if a further iteration is required and an agreement on a specific model area that 
should be further improved.  
In the context of our research the modeling tool FlexNet Architect is used for three 
purposes: First of all, since the tool forms one possible implementation of the model-
ing language, it directly supports the research process by providing means of structur-
ing and processing the collected actor-specific information, as well as the identified 
information flows and exchanged information objects with regard to the aspired refer-
ence model. Second, by the usage of scenarios it is not only possible to fully docu-
ment the development path, but also to create branches for considering model  
variants. Finally, another focus of the research lies on the development of standar-
dized templates for model components and standardized specifications of electronic 
business documents which is supported by the FlexNet Architect. These templates not 
only serve as “best practices” but also accelerate the later adaptation of the reference 
model for specific business cases. Details concerning the so far performed iterations 
and their results are presented in the subsequent chapters.

Results of the Research Process 
4.1 
Results of the Exploratory Phase 
We stepped into the development of our model by first identifying the relevant partic-
ipants of FM projects as they are described by extant literature. We could identify 
three classes of commonly accepted actors: the general planner (including technical 
planners and the architect), the building constructor, and the building owner (who 
consolidates the interests of owners, project developers and occupants). For each of 
these actors, we tapped into existent and widely-accepted frameworks in order to 
achieve a first conceptualization of their individual divisions and activities. Table 1 
lists the specific frameworks and guidelines that we used.  
Table 1. Applied frameworks and guidelines [5, 28-33] 
 
Table 2. Extract of questions for deepening phase’s problem-centric interviews 
 
Although these frameworks and guidelines constituted a profound basis for our 
purpose, i.e. to develop a reference model for information flows in FMC, they do not 
address the network of actors and the required coordination and information exchange 
between the actors, accordingly. 
Subsequently, all the collected information has been composed in an actor-specific 
way and it was used for providing a problem-centric discussion basis for the interviews 
in the second phase of the research process [34-35]. Structured in a corresponding 

114 
A.-K. Averbeck et al.  
catalogue of central questions  (Table 2), the interviews aimed at the extraction of 
deeper insights into the individual actor’s structures and processes, but also at the iden-
tification of actor-comprehensive cooperatively performed activities [36].  
4.2 
Results of the Deepening Phase 
As a starting point for the problem-centered interviews and workshops with partners 
from practice (Table 3), we further included eight modules into our draft reference 
model that capture collaborative activities required between the four actors. These 
modules lend themselves to the chronological phases as defined in the Official Scale 
of Fees for Services by Architects and Engineers (HOAI) [30]. 
Table 3. Overview of conducted interviews 
 
Then every actor from the exploratory phase and the FM Consultant were subject 
to a detailed investigation in order to further develop the existing model. Actor- and 
division-individual processes were documented by event-driven process chains (EPC) 
that were iteratively refined during the problem-centered interviews and through sev-
eral workshops. On the basis of 40 interviews we created more than 50 process mod-
els that cover the current state of interaction in FMC service networks. The interviews 
were analyzed following the summarized qualitative content approach as proposed by 
Mayring [34]. For the further specification of the information flows and document 
structures, cross-actor EPCs have been derived from the actor-specific process mod-
els. Finally, all results have been integrated into a new intermediate version of the 
reference model using the FlexNet Architect software tool. 
4.3 
Current State of the Reference Model 
Fig. 3 displays an extract of the current state of the reference model. As shown in this 
screenshot from the FlexNet Architect software tool, the actors and their divisions as well 
as the structures for covering the collaborative activities are yet described on a detailed 
level. The model further includes actor-specific processes, which are however not exhi-
bited in the figure, but which are assigned to their particular divisions. Moreover, a huge 
amount of information flows between the collaborative activities as well as the actors’ 
individual activities have been identified. However, especially with regard to the collabo-
ration between the actors, the information flows and associated information objects still  

 
Towards a Reference Model of Information Exchange and Coordination 
115 
require a fundamental revision. Particularly the identification of commonly exchanged 
business documents and their structures has still to be addressed in a further research 
phase with accordingly focused interviews and workshops. 
 
Fig. 3. Application of the modeling language on the web platform 
At this current state, the project highlights the importance of documenting the collabo-
ration between the different actors already. The model emphasized the documentation of 
accordant information flows and exchanged information objects using a consistent mod-
eling language. In the following, the information exchange and associated activities sur-
rounding one of the central documents for a life cycle oriented planning will be further 
described by using the structures of the presented modeling language. 
The industry standard DIN 18205 addresses the requirements planning in the con-
struction industry, and it highlights the importance of identifying user needs [37]. The 
standard suggests defining a room program which documents the expressions type 
and number of required rooms from the perspective of the building owner respective-
ly the later occupant. This document can be further detailed through a room book. A 
room book bundles various detailed information that are relevant for the whole life 
cycle of building sections and consequently for the entire building in one single doc-
ument. Typically it comprises information such as the room sizes, room numbers, and 
occupancies or to be cleaned surfaces, as well as details about room-specific ventila-
tion and air-conditioning technologies or further electrical installations. For capturing 
these information in an often digitally maintained room book, successive  

116 
A.-K. Averbeck et al.  
contributions and thus a systematic collaboration of the different actors partaking in 
the network is required. 
At the beginning of the construction planning, the building owner respectively oc-
cupant has to define the room program, which provides a first detailed overview of 
the construction works. Since most individuals lack the necessary knowledge for 
properly creating an accordant document, the room program is often defined in colla-
boration between an expert, such as the architect (whose role is summarized in the 
general planner), and the building owner respectively occupant. During the final de-
sign (HOAI phase 3), the architect uses the room program as a first orientation for the 
creation of the building’s conceptual design. In the context of the execution drawings 
(HOAI phase 5), the information from the room program can be used as an input for 
further specifying the later accomplished rooms in the room book. Although the crea-
tion of the room book, according to the HOAI, does not belong to the basic but spe-
cial services provided by the architect, it provides highly relevant information for the 
purchasing of the furniture and embedding of the technical infrastructure (construc-
tion) and especially for the planning, preparation and execution of later cleaning, 
maintenance, refurbishment or rebuilding tasks along the life cycle of the building. 
Additionally, the FM Consultant analyzes the room book with a life cycle-oriented 
perspective for discovering further potentials for optimizing the total costs associated 
with the to-be utilized materials or the to-be installed technical infrastructure and 
provides the building owner with recommendations that form the basis of potential 
further adaptations of the room book. Finally, further adaptations of the room book 
during the construction process (execution) and even in the later operation of the 
building are possible and need to be thoroughly documented. 
On the basis of this example and against the background of the previously intro-
duced modeling language Table 4 exhibits an extract of the activities that are required 
for the creation and adaptation of the room program and the room book.  
Table 4. Exemplified collaboration for creation and adaption of a room book

This example illustrates that the role of the FM Consultant in the network is not yet 
fixed in terms of employed structures, procedures and precise definitions and still 
requires for clarification and extension. Actually the applied tools and methods 
strongly differ in many cases within the examined units. However, the project’s cur-
rent results point out that the main aim of the FM Consultant is the integration of 
technical, infrastructural and commercial expertise on sustainable facility-related 
planning over the whole life cycle of the object and thus to reduce the accordant du-
ties of other actors, especially the general planner, in the network. Moreover, our 
research shows that the role of FM Consultant with his interdisciplinary knowledge 
indeed resembles that of an intermediary, who especially supports tasks of the early 
phases, such as the project initiation, preparation and the preliminary design, but who 
also inherits duties in the commissioning phase, e.g. the documentation tasks. Never-
theless, the complexity and heterogeneity of this service complicates a unique and 
generic phase orientation and definition of the FMC’s specific scope. Especially the 
information flows and coordinative actions between the general contractor and the 
FM Consultant are yet to be further distinguished.  
5 
Limitations, Outlook and Conclusion 
This research-in-progress paper presents and discusses an intermediate version of a 
reference information model. From a careful review of the extant FM literature and 
industry standards we identified four actors that typically constitute any FMC service 
network: the general planer, the building constructor, the FM consultant and the 
building owner. The model describes activities to be accounted by each of the actors 
as we could identify it from the literature. Based on the analysis of more than 50 
processes as observed in practice, the model further suggests and prescribes a corpus 
of well-established interaction and information exchange between the actors with the 
intention to speed-up the formation of FMC service networks and to improve the 
quality of FMC service network organizations.  
However, at this stage this work is subject to several limitations. In practice a FMC 
service network involves further actors than the discussed such as the governmental 
authorities. Some actors could be replaced if distinguishing more fine-granular roles; 
for instance the general planner could be substituted by specialist engineers such as 
the land and soil surveyor, the structural engineer or the building physicist. It is fur-
ther possible to differentiate between the building owner and the occupant of a facility 
and. The occupant and his individual activities then could be represented as an addi-
tional actor. Concerning a life cycle oriented planning and maintenance of the facility, 
it might be helpful to integrate the service-specific know-how of the individual ser-
vice providers during the operating and utilization phases. Some of these central ser-
vices are already covered, at least on an aggregated level, by the FM Consultant.  
These observations from the status-quo reference model will be addressed in future 
research. Two further research phases are yet planned. Phase 1 will focus on refining 
and further justifying the collaborative processes and required information flows in 
the FMC network and on consolidating the set of information objects. Through further 

118 
A.-K. Averbeck et al.  
interviews and especially by introducing and establishing additional modeling guide-
lines, which are to be designed on the basis of our gained domain-specific knowledge, 
we aim at the unification of the used terminology as well as the elimination of redun-
dancies. In a yet further development phase we will contact general standard commit-
tees such as the German standards association (DIN) or the association of German 
engineers (VDI) or alternatively FM-specific associations such as the German Facility 
Management Association (GEFMA) or the International Facility Management Asso-
ciation (IFMA) for a further discussion and refinement of the reference model.  
The presented research-in-progress, however, yet offers contributions to research 
and to practice. Researchers from Management and Information Systems disciplines 
might be inspired by seeing the iterative application of empirical studies in order to 
gradually refine an information reference model and to see that this iterative proce-
dure is smoothly supported by the used modeling language. FM researchers can di-
rectly tap into the “best practice” conceptualization of information exchange and 
coordination in FMC networks as we elaborated it from a careful study of the litera-
ture and our empirical data.  
Domain experts from the FMC area instead might directly tap into the reference 
model and might take the prescribed information exchanges and coordination activi-
ties as a basis when establishing new FMC service networks or when trying to im-
prove the organization of existing ones. At this, the presented reference model already 
provides an overview of the required services of the involved actors and it contains 
first recommendations for common document types and points of time for their ex-
change. Thereby the reference model is expected to increase the level of standardiza-
tion, an issue that can however only be evaluated in long-term projects; and we are 
confident that it will help to establish a common terminology and understanding of 
the central processes and informational duties in service networks, which will already 
help overcoming many coordination problems observed in today’s FMC service net-
works.

Abstract. Product-service systems (PSS) adoption has increased over the last 
years due to its potential for innovative value creation. However, the identifica-
tion of ideas and opportunities in the innovation planning and the structuring of 
PSS projects are still incipient in organizations, following the same patterns 
adopted for product development. Currently, there is not a systematic approach 
that can be followed for the formulation of PSS proposals in the fuzzy front 
end. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop a method for defining PSS 
project proposals based on attributes that should be considered by companies 
during this definition. The systematization of PSS attributes may help increase 
the knowledge about different PSS projects that can emerge in the front end, 
thus leading to the discovery of opportunities that are not apparent in the exist-
ing business models and give rise to new ideas that can be translated into suc-
cessful projects. 
Keywords: Product-Service System, Fuzzy front end, Proposal, Attributes.

Introduction 
Growing competitiveness and market demands drive companies to seek new ways to 
create and deliver value to their customers. In this regard, the Product-Service System 
– PSS approach has been suggested as an alternative for companies seeking to consid-
er these aspects in their business.  
The PSS can be considered an alternative for companies seeking innovation in their 
business, since its development requires changes or the creation of new business. In 
PSS, the paradigm of developing solutions only in the form of physical products to be 
sold must be broken, because value is not necessarily provided through the sale of the 
physical product, but instead, by means of the functionality or result it can generate. 
This form of offering value differs from the way in which the traditional business 
model of companies is structured, which involves only the development and sale of 
physical products [1].  
Thus, one of the major changes involves the context in which PSS is developed, 
which goes beyond product development to also encompass the strategy and

Systematic Approach to Formulate PSS Development Project Proposals

PSS development requires the holistic and multifunctional vision indicated by Jet-
ter [8]. Structuring PSS proposals based on their characteristics and attributes can 
make it easier to understand them from the business standpoint, as suggested in the 
literature [9, 10, 1, 11, 12]. Within this context, the aim of this research is to develop a 
tool for defining PSS project proposals that considers items of the product project and 
of PSS.

Literature Review 
2.1 
Characteristics of the Fuzzy Front End 
The front end encompasses the activities performed prior to the development of  
technologies, products and/or services or new business [13], starting from the identifi-
cation of an idea or opportunity and ending when the company approves the devel-
opment of the project [14]. 
A strong characteristic of the front end is uncertainty, according to Jetter [8] and 
Koen et al. [15]. The uncertainties and dynamism of the information required and 
generated during the front end make it difficult to adopt a structured approach to 
manage this process [16]. Therefore, the process-oriented approach to study complex 
processes, which is the case of the front end, is not always considered the most suita-
ble one. Some authors suggest an information processing approach, also known as the 
uncertainty reduction approach [17], to be used in the front end. In this approach, the 
focus is on the analysis of information that is processed throughout the front end. This 
information therefore assumes a primary role, while the activities assume a secondary 
role. Therefore, the information processing approach assumes that at the beginning of 
the process there is zero knowledge about this information and that, at the end of the 
process, there will be complete knowledge about the information [18].  
It should also be noted that, despite the extreme importance of the front end to the 
performance and success of the product and service innovation process [19, 14], this 
process usually involves a small team or only one person [15]. This fact may influ-
ence decisions made during the front end, because of the possible lack of knowledge 
about given functional areas to underpin the most suitable decision. In this regard, 
Moenaert et al. [17] mention the importance of creating innovation teams composed 
of people from different functional areas, who know where to look for information or 
who possess information from different sources and areas of knowledge, thereby re-
ducing the uncertainties. Information about the newness of the market, the technology 
and the product would be known and used during the front end, which would help in 
creating more robust and complete project proposals and would thus increase the 
chances of assertiveness in the approval of development proposals. 
2.2 
PSS Perspectives  
Tan [1] defines PSS as a new approach that integrates activities and competences of 
an organization, and intensifies its relationship with clients and partners in the value 

124 
A.P.B. Barquet, D.C.A. Pigosso, and H. Rozenfeld 
 
chain. Like Manzini and Vezzoli [20], Tan [1] believes that the development of PSS 
represents an expansion of the scope of the product development process (PDP). PSS 
involves different areas of expertise, each of which addresses PSS from a different 
perspective [1].  Thus, this paper addresses PSS according to three perspectives 
adapted from those suggested by Tan [1], all of them from the point of view of PSS 
providers. These perspectives are: 
• PSS Proposals: are created in the front end, based on new ideas and strategies.  
• PSS Development: begins when a PSS proposal is approved for development. At 
the product project level, it encompasses the activities of planning, design, detail-
ing, product manufacturing and service offering, as well as the activities that occur 
during the product’s life cycle. However, PSS development o should be treated as 
an expansion of the scope of the product development process by also considering 
the development of the business. Thus, the development of the business, the design 
of the PSS, and the execution of the PSS project are addressed within the ambit of 
PSS development. The result of PSS development is PSS offerings. 
• PSS Offerings: are the combined service and product options that are offered and 
supplied to clients. 
Figure 2 illustrates the three PSS perspectives addressed in this paper.

Methodology  
The steps defined for the construction of the tool are: identification of items, systema-
tization of items, and definition of the relationship between the attributes. 
3.1 
Identification of the Items 
To identify the items, two Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) were performed, one 
involving product project literature and the other PSS-related literature. SLR is a 
technique used for mapping published papers about a particular theme, to assist in the 
preparation of summaries about existing knowledge of the subject [21].

3.2 
Systematization of the Items  
To compile and organize the product project and PSS items identified in the SLR 
involves several tasks: arrange the characteristics and attributes of the product project 
and of PSS and define the hierarchy among the items after making this arrangement. 
The result of the systematization of the items is a conceptual framework of PSS, with 
defined dimensions, characteristics and attributes. 
3.3 
Definition of the Relationships between Attributes  
This activity involves defining the relationships of dependence between attributes, 
using the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) method, which focuses on the representa-
tion of information flow rather than of workflow [22]. Thus, the DSM method is ac-
cording consistent with the information processing approach. The first step in the 
method is to enter the elements in a binary matrix with identical rows and columns. 
An analysis of the rows indicates to which elements that element provides something. 
An analysis of the columns, in turn, indicates which other elements in that column 
depend on a given element. Thus, the columns indicate input sources and the rows 
indicate outputs [23].  
In the first step, the attributes of the PSS conceptual framework are used as ele-
ments. In the second step, the attributes are entered in a square matrix and relation-
ships between them are defined, thus generating the relationship matrix. Following 
the steps of the method, the partitioning procedure is performed by means of the topo-
logical sorting algorithm, which determines the sequence of the attributes. Knowing 
the sequence of the attributes is essential to indicate the order of their selection by the 
PSS Proposal Configuration tool. This sequencing can be used to guide the selection 
of attributes and their values during the front end, assisting in the preparation of PSS 
proposals.

PSS Proposal Configuration Tool  
The tool proposed in this work is called a PSS Proposal Configuration Tool. The 
items (dimensions, characteristics, attributes and values) that comprise the tool are 
identified below. 
4.1 
Identification of the Items  
Items of Product Development Projects. The characteristics and attributes found in 
the literature on product project were classified according to the following dimen-
sions: Projects, Knowledge and competence, External actors, Innovation, Complexity, 
and Environmental aspect. Table 2 exemplifies the attributes of the characteristic 
“project management,” which refers to the dimension “Projects.”

In all, the items of product project comprise 6 dimensions, 30 characteristics and 
110 attributes. Thus, these are the 146 items that were found in the SLR on product 
project items.  
PSS Items. Unlike the findings on product project, the characteristics found in the 
PSS typologies are at the business level. This fact is consistent with several works in 
the literature [1, 10] and led to the need to classify the PSS characteristics and 
attributes according to dimensions of business models, which are: value proposition, 
partnerships, relationship with the client, cost structure, revenue model, distribution 
channel, market segment, processes and activities and resources [27]. Table 3 lists the 
attributes of the characteristic “product ownership,” which refers to the dimension 
“Relationship with the client.”

Structure. Each of these dimensions cover at least two characteristics. For example, 
the characteristics of the Market dimension are: Types of clients and Innovation on 
Client Segment. 
The three circles inside the framework indicate aspects that encompass more than 
one characteristic. These aspects are innovation, environmental aspect and complexi-
ty. Therefore, the framework embraces the following characteristics for complexity 
aspect: Product Complexity, Technology Complexity and Manufacture Process Com-
plexity. Regarding environmental aspect, the characteristics generated are: Environ-
mental Aspect of Service and Environmental Aspect of Product. Lastly, innovation 
aspect resulted in some characteristics, such as:  Product Innovation, Service Innova-
tion, Technology Innovation, Manufacture Process Innovation and Innovation on 
Client Segment. 
4.3 
Definition of the Relationship between Attributes   
Construction of the DSM. The next step in the construction of the PSS Proposal 
Configuration Tool consisted of the analysis of the relationships between the 
attributes, in order to define the flow of attribute selection. These relationships were 
defined using the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) method, which allows for the crea-
tion and analysis of relationship matrices [23]. The first step of the DSM method is 
the identification of attributes. This was possible by means of the previous steps: 
identification and systematization of the items. The 134 identified attributes were 
entered in the first column and the first row of the matrix. Then, the relationships of 
each row with each column were analyzed, in order to identify the relationship be-
tween the attributes, as mentioned in section 2 – Methodology. 
Sequencing between Attributes. The relationship matrix was analyzed using the 
Excel Macros for Partitioning and Simulation tool [29]. This tool consists of an Excel 
spreadsheet that contains a specific macro for entering the attributes and relationships 
and for analysis of the matrix. First, to determine the sequence of the attributes, the 
Partitioning analysis was performed, whose objective is to resequence the attributes of 
the matrix so as to maximize the availability of the required information [30]. The 
partitioning analysis indicates the sequencing of attributes that will be used to define 
the flow of attribute selection and then to conclude the creation of the method.  
4.4 
Comments about the Method 
The PSS Proposal Configuration Tool proposed here aims to support organizations in 
the creation of PSS proposals. Based on a list of attributes with different values, inno-
vation teams can reflect about the creation of a PSS proposal during the front end. In 
addition, the attributes of the configuration tool originate from different areas of 
knowledge, taking into account the systemic vision to be considered in the front end. 
Thus, it is suggested that the innovation team be composed of people from different 
functional areas. Based on the information processing approach, the values of the 
attributes are selected as the information and knowledge of the innovation team in-
crease. The more values that are selected the greater the knowledge of the team and 
the closer they will be to completing the front end and defining the PSS proposal.

Conclusions 
This paper discusses the development of a tool to support the creation of PSS propos-
als. The information of both product and business project give the content of the tool 
a holistic character. Moreover, the tool’s content considers a multifunctional vision. 
In this regard, the creation of front end innovation teams is proposed, since the use of 
the tool requires knowledge of different functional areas, which increases the wealth 
of information used in the definition of PSS proposals.  
The use of the DSM method was considered a systematic way to seek the relation-
ships and organize the attributes according to the information processing approach. 
The next steps in this work include consultations with experts to evaluate the sequenc-
ing of the attributes defined by the DSM method, as well as the development of a 
software program to automate the tool and apply it at companies, aiming to evaluate 
its practical use.

Abstract. The emergence of product/service-systems has meant that develop-
ment methods for such systems have emerged from academia. This paper inves-
tigates existing methods that are aimed at developing product/service-systems. 
Two aspects are determined for each examined method. The first aspect that has 
been surveyed is when a given method is meant to be used in the development 
of a product/service-system. This aspect has been determined through a qualita-
tive assessment of each method. The second aspect surveyed is which persons 
in an organisation who are seen as the main drivers in the use of the methods. 
To gain this insight a questionnaire for each method has been conducted with 
the authors of the methods as participants. The main finding indicates that cur-
rent PSS methods cannot thoroughly support the development of prod-
uct/service-systems as their specificity is too low and that the methods need 
strong intra-organisational collaboration or even roles that do not yet exist. 
Keywords: product/service-systems, methods, design, organisation.

Introduction 
Product/service-systems (PSS) are integrated offerings of products together with ser-
vices such as repair, maintenance, training or even operation of products. Furthermore 
the company can have the responsibility of disposing of the product, when it is no 
longer useable for the customer. In a world with increased competition and scarce 
resources product/service-systems have come to be seen as a possible way to counter 
these challenges, if done well. Such integrated offerings mean that a company and its 
customer will have a transactional relationship that lasts beyond mere product sale. 
Companies that successfully embrace PSS can have a stable source of revenue and 
tight ties with their customers, while also having an incentive to make their products 
as efficient as possible. At the same time, the customer can have stable access to the 
utility that the products bring, without having to deal with the inconveniences associ-
ated with owning a product [1]. 
When a company wants to offer PSS to its customers it will need to be able to co-
ordinate the features of its products with the services it can provide. Therefore PSS 
calls for the collaboration between organisational units that concentrate on research 
and development of products with those units in an organisation that develop and 

132 
H.N. Hinz, N. Bey, and T.C. McAloone 
provide services. Also, PSS requires a company to coordinate with its suppliers, be-
cause its ability to provide products, maintenance and other services is also very often 
dependent on its suppliers [2]. In other words the design of PSS represents an exten-
sion of the design activities, when compared to product design [3]. As a research field 
PSS is still relatively immature, when comparing to traditional product development; 
there is still a lack of understanding of how PSS should be designed. Based on this 
insight, the aim of this paper is twofold: First to show where a number of PSS devel-
opment methods are to be used within a generic PSS development process and use 
this to analyse the state of existing PSS methods in general; Secondly to investigate 
who the intended users of the methods are, who are seen as the main drivers of PSS 
development and what this says about the usability of the methods. 
In the following section the methodology of the paper is explained, a definition of 
what constitutes a method is presented and a general framework for PSS development 
is established. The analysis gives a short summary of the methods that have been 
investigated, shows which part of the general PSS development framework each of 
the methods is suited to and shows who the intended users of the methods are, along 
with a brief explanation of the authors’ view on who should drive PSS development. 
The discussion comments on the characteristics of PSS development methods and on 
what the intended users of the methods says about PSS development in general. Fi-
nally the conclusion picks up on the work that has been carried out and the results that 
have been presented.

Methodology 
In this paper seven development methods are examined with regards to when in a PSS 
development process they are used and which persons who are going to use them. In 
order to select development methods for further analysis a definition of what consti-
tutes a PSS method was defined. To be able to assess when the methods are used in a 
development process, a general framework of PSS development was established, so 
each method could be compared with it. Thus the goal of the PSS development 
framework is not prescriptive, but descriptive. 
2.1 
Definition of a Method 
The definition of a method that has been used in this paper is the following: A method 
is a collection of connected activities that have a finite span in time. By a collection of 
connected activities is meant that a method consists of a sequence of activities, either 
in parallel or serial that gives output to another activity until the end activity. For 
example investigating customer needs is an activity but not a method. The same could 
be said about formulating requirements for a system. Furthermore investigating cus-
tomer needs and formulating requirements is not part of a method as long as they are 
not connected. It is a method only if the output of an investigation of customer needs 
is used as a basis for formulating system requirements. The span in time is understood 
such that sequence of activities end at some defined point. When product in use data 

 
Timing and Targeting of PSS Methods and Tools 
133 
is collected as means for informing a design process that ends up with a new PSS that 
is regarded as a method, but when product-in-use data is continuously used to adjust 
maintenance schedules it is not regarded as a method, but as a running process. 
The definition of what constitutes a method has meant that the analysis has in-
cluded a number of works that have not specifically been labelled as ‘methods’ by 
their authors. Furthermore the definition does not in itself deal with the specificity of 
methods. That is, methods can have a broad scope, such as creating an operational 
strategy for a PSS or have a more narrow focus as for example a detailed method for 
the investigating user needs. The specificity of the methods is analysed by comparing 
them to the general framework of PSS development. 
2.2 
A General Framework of PSS Development 
The framework of PSS development has been created on the notion that since PSS is 
not a one-time delivery, but a continuous interaction with the customer expanded in 
the time domain [3]. As such it is possible for a company to keep on altering both 
products and services even after the customer has begun to receive the offering. The 
framework is based on the phases found in [4]. It unites some of the phases that are 
similar and adds a phase called ‘tactical considerations’ in order to catch the activities 
that lie between the strategic decision to work with PSS and design of a PSS. The 
framework is shown in figure 1.

The Selected Methods 
The methods that have been surveyed have been chosen on the basis of earlier work 
conducted that has analysed the research of PSS research clusters. The selected meth-
ods are either built on existing methods for product development, like Müller and 
Tactical considerations
Collection of needs and requirements
Concept generation and development
Detailing
Implementation
Monitoring and evaluation

Stark, Ericson et al. and Matzen and McAloone [5-7], new methods focused on con-
ceptualising PSS in the case of Hussain et al. and Vasantha et al. [8-9], or methods 
that deal with data collected in a PSS solution, which is the case for Seliger et al. and 
Sakao and Shimomura [10-11]. 
The assessment of where each of the methods fit into the general development 
framework has been achieved by analysing the content of each of the papers that de-
scribe the method. The mapping of the intended users of each of the methods has been 
achieved by conducting a survey with the authors of the papers. The survey consisted 
of the following three questions: 
1. Which persons or departments in an organisation did you wish to target when you 
developed the method? 
2. Did you get input from any persons in companies that are not mentioned in the pa-
per? If so from whom? 
3. Which persons or departments in an organisation do you see as the most important 
drivers for the development of PSS? 
Where possible the first authors have been used as main contacts and sources for the 
survey, otherwise other authors have been contacted and surveyed. The authors have 
either replied in writing or through telephone interviews.

Analysis 
3.1 
Placement of Methods in Time 
In the following each of the investigated methods are analysed with regards to which 
phases in the general framework for PSS development they follow. This is done by 
going through each of the methods and justifying how different parts of them fit into 
one or more of the general activities of the general framework. Even though none of 
the methods cover all of the activities in the general framework it is not the same as 
the existence of these activities is deemed unimportant or unnecessary in the methods. 
It rather demonstrates the specific focus of the methods. In addition to the assessment 
of the activities covered it is also explained whether an existing system is a require-
ment for the use of the methods. 
The Activity Cycle Model of Matzen and McAloone is a method that makes its us-
ers analyse a market situation in order to generate a number of so called views that 
shows the needs of a customer along with the activities that supports these require-
ments and the actors that are involved with fulfilling the requirements. Thus the 
method guides its users to do some early tactical considerations about the actor-
network that surrounds the customer without considering the users and their  
company’s own role. Furthermore the identification of needs can be seen as part of 
collecting requirements. Later on the views are used as input for developing offerings 
and suggesting network collaborations, which can be considered concept generation 
and development. 
The method for PSS design demonstrated by Ericsson et al. presents a model with 
five steps for developing PSS where four of the steps are related to modules that are 

 
Timing and Targeting of PSS Methods and Tools 
135 
used in the product development system, TRIZ. The first two steps are to identify 
needs and identify product characteristics, which corresponds to collection of needs 
and requirements. The last three steps are all concerned with concept generation and 
development. The method does not take any input from an existing system. 
The model from Hussain et al. is generally applicable to systems where perform-
ance needs to be improved. It looks upon an existing system where gaps between 
customer requirements and the systems capability is first identified by using service 
blueprints as a mapping method. Thus the method deals with collection of needs and 
requirements. Then a proposals matrix is used to present and analyse solutions which 
can service to close the gap between the customer requirements and the PSS capabili-
ties, which in turn represents concept generation and development. 
The method of Vasantha et al. presents a number of activities needed to do devel-
opment of PSS. It is stressed that even though the activities are presented in a serial 
sequence this is only done for simplicity. In reality all of the activities are intercon-
nected and therefore give output to each other, except for the signing of a contract, 
which is the final activity that only receives inputs. Two of the activities are con-
cerned with identifying the customer’s needs and what is required to meet these 
needs, which is collecting requirements. Other activities are to identify which tasks 
are needed to fulfil the customer’s needs at both the company that mainly delivers to 
the customers, as well as at the suppliers, and these are in turn concept generation and 
development. Finally some of the activities are concerned with developing business 
models, relegating responsibilities and evaluating solutions, which are regarded as 
detailing. 
Sakao & Shimomura’s method starts out by establishing a model that shows the in-
teractions among high-level actors (e.g. companies) based on an existing system. 
Thus this method actually starts out with what can be regarded as concept generation 
and development before establishing a number of customer preferences that are 
equivalent to collection of needs and requirements. In the end the interactions be-
tween high level actors is elaborated on further by generating a so called realisation 
structure which corresponds to detailing, before finally modifying the high-level 
model to reflect any changes that have been made. 
The approach presented by Müller & Stark, which according to the authors should 
be seen as work in progress, consists of a method based on a product development 
model. It consists of a number of activities from the initial project planning to the 
delivery of the PSS, with some parallel activities in the method, where development 
of services, products and systems take place concurrently. Together all of the activi-
ties in the method deal with the collection of needs and requirements, generation and 
development, detailing and implementation. 
The methods that Seliger et al. show are built upon an already existing PSS, where 
the product has been fitted with equipment used for measuring the behaviour and the 
performance of the product. The data that are generated are then treated though a 
number of activities that prepare the data for being used for developing the PSS fur-
ther. Together these activities constitute monitoring and evaluation. 
As it can be seen from the above, a number of activities are covered in the general 
development framework. A summary of the distribution of covered activities can be 
seen in Table 1.

Users of the Methods 
In order to provide an understanding not only of the characteristics of the methods but 
also of their users it was investigated, who were the intended users of the methods, by 
conducting brief interviews with the authors of the papers, describing each of the 
methods. For each of the methods a description of the intended users has been re-
ceived. Along with information of the users the authors have provided information 
about who have given input to their work in addition to those mentioned in their pa-
pers. Thus it is possible to understand the background of the methods. Finally an ap-
praisal of who should be the drivers of PSS development in general was given, which 
provided a view of the general understanding of the PSS development process in aca-
demia. The information that has been gathered is collected in Table 2. 
When it comes to the intended users of the methods most of the authors point to a 
either people or teams with trans-disciplinary competencies or towards a group of 
people that together form a collection of competencies. With regards to the Systems 
Engineer and the PSS Architect the authors specifically pointed out, that these roles 
hardly exist in any companies. As for the sources used for inputs for the methods the 
answers also shows a lot of different roles have been utilised. With regards to the 
drivers of PSS the authors mostly point to the managers especially in the beginning of 
development. In the cases where management is only seen as the initial driver, the 
authors point to some kind of trans-disciplinary role to take over.

Discussion 
As it can be seen from the analysis of the placement of methods in time, all but one of 
the methods deal with collection of needs and requirements and concept generation 
and development, while detailing is touched upon by three of the methods. Contrary 

138 
H.N. Hinz, N. Bey, and T.C. McAloone 
to this is the remainder of the activities that are either only treated by one method or 
not treated at all, as is the case with end-of-life support. This indicates that the exist-
ing methods for PSS development are still not able to support the development  
process in all of the phases. This does not mean that the quality of the methods is 
insufficient though.  They might do what they are supposed to do very well and a 
discussion of the quality of the methods is out of scope of this paper. Rather, the lack 
of support for some of the activities could indicate that there is a lack of detailed 
knowledge within PSS research about how these activities should be properly sup-
ported and that the specificities of the existing methods are generally low. Further-
more the methods are generic in relation to the characteristics of the PSS solution that 
has to be developed. In other words, while being generic is certainly part of the point 
of using a method, it is still noticeable that none of the methods relate to different 
types of PSS, as for instance found in [12]. 
A general theme throughout the interviews with the authors is that of trans-
disciplinary collaboration. It is a recurring theme within PSS research that the devel-
opment requires collaboration across different functions in a company. Furthermore 
some of the authors point towards the need for somebody with a role that spans all 
involved departments, to use the methods or drive the PSS development. As it has 
been pointed out this role is rarely found in the companies that work with PSS. This 
means that there is a risk that some of the advantages of using these methods might be 
deteriorated by the companies’ structures that makes them unable to use the methods 
in the best possible way. 
5 
Conclusion 
Seven methods have been investigated by comparing them to a general framework of 
PSS development and by interviewing their authors about the intended users of the 
methods. The knowledge this has generated has been used as a basis for an evaluation 
of the state of PSS development methods. The results indicate that most PSS methods 
have a low amount of specificity, are highly generic and mostly concentrate of formu-
lating needs and requirements as well as conceptualisation. There is a lack of methods 
that can support the development of PSS throughout the development process. The 
methods investigated are mostly meant to be used across a number of disciplines, 
which either calls for strong collaboration across departments or the introduction of 
new roles in the companies that use them.

Abstract. Product service systems (PSS) are a strategic option to increase raw 
material efficiency by intensifying product use or decoupling volume from 
profitability. To increase their market share in resource-intensive industries, this 
paper discusses an assessment approach based on the multi-criteria method 
PROMETHEE, which considers the benefits and perceived risks in a transpa-
rent way. The necessary criteria covering all aspects of the decision to introduce 
a PSS focusing on raw material efficiency are identified and determined by ex-
pert interviews and a comprehensive literature research. 
Keywords: PSS, raw material efficiency, multi-criteria decision making, 
PROMETHEE.

Introduction 
Raw material efficiency is turning into a crucial topic for the German manufacturing 
industry, because Germany is a country with limited natural resources and because 
there is a growing global demand for certain scarce resources as well as increasingly 
volatile and rising material costs [1]. Thus, it is particularly important for German 
industries to use raw materials and resources more efficiently. Especially resource-
intensive industries which have a large demand for raw materials such as, e. g. the 
chemical, non-ferrous metal and steel making industries, have to employ technolo-
gies, concepts and strategies which focus on raw material efficiency in order to re-
main competitive [2]. 
Besides technological developments, implementing product-service systems (PSS) 
is a strategic option to achieve this objective, e. g. by intensifying product use, or by 
applying the specific expertise of a provider to use the product more efficiently. 
PSS create conditions which can improve the profitability situation of the compa-
nies involved, not only through the products as such, but largely, or even entirely, 
through certain services or functions performed by the provider. Among others, the 
benefit of using PSS in the industrial sector is revealed in an increased productivity 

142 
K. Mattes, E. Bollhöfer, and M. Miller 
 
and customer loyalty as well as competitive differentiation. This benefit is valid for 
both suppliers and customers [3]. Moreover, PSS enable the decoupling of volume 
(producing lots of goods) from profitability and – as a consequence – focus on the 
functionality, not on the material content. By this means they can reduce the environ-
mental impact of production systems [4] [5]. 
A representative large-scale survey of German manufacturing industries conducted 
in 2009 [6] with a sample of 1,484 companies indicates the relevance of different 
motivational factors for offering and using PSS. Besides the ever-present aspect of 
cost-effectiveness, ecological aspects of sustainability are also crucial, e. g. in the case 
of energy-contracting [7]. The current use of different PSS concepts aiming to reduce 
material and energy consumption is plotted in Figure 1. Especially concepts such as 
chemical leasing (58 %), contracts for continuous optimization (36 %), pay on pro-
duction and guaranteed life cycle costs (31 % each) seem to have an impact on the 
reduction of energy and material consumption. However, when considering the diffu-
sion of PSS in resource-intensive industries1, only 24 % of the companies use at least 
one of these five PSS [8]. 
 
Fig. 1. Usage of different PSS concepts to reduce energy and material consumption 
Quantitative (cf. Figure 1) as well as qualitative results [9] have shown the poten-
tial of PSS to reduce resource consumption in raw material-intensive production sys-
tems. And yet the market share of PSS is still relatively low. In order to enhance the 
awareness of the benefits of PSS regarding their potential to increase material effi-
ciency and to overcome existing barriers which impede the usage of such PSS, this 
paper describes a decision support model. Decisions for implementing PSS are stra-
tegic and complex due to the scope of their impacts such as changes in the ownership 
structure and property rights as well as the level of customer involvement. Hence,

various objectives should be considered: Besides the competitiveness of the PSS, they 
have to comply with ecological and technical requirements. The influencing criteria 
can be qualitative or quantitative in nature. Additionally, conflicting target parameters 
should be taken into account. Consequently, a multi-criteria decision support model is 
developed in this paper, which helps companies decide in favor of PSS focusing on 
material efficiency, if the value creation architecture is economically and ecologically 
attractive.  
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the methodology 
applied. Section 3 focuses on a literature review regarding PSS and material efficien-
cy and describes the barriers impeding the usage of PSS and their potential to increase 
material efficiency. Section 4 develops a multi-criteria approach for evaluating PSS. 
Different criteria are identified based on the literature review and expert interviews 
which cover the different aspects of PSS such as material efficiency as well as the 
economic and organizational perspectives. The last section concludes the paper.

Methodology 
The aim of this paper is to develop an assessment approach for PSS which compares 
different PSS in a transparent way, assesses their benefits and barriers and, as a con-
sequence, facilitates the decision to introduce them and/or increase their utilization. A 
multi-criteria decision approach seems to be suitable for selecting appropriate PSS 
which fit the corporate strategy as it considers the different objectives and preferences 
of decision-makers using e. g. economic, ecological and technical criteria. Where 
there are competing objectives, the attributes of the criteria might even be contradicto-
ry [10]. Moreover, applying a multi-criteria decision approach should make the poten-
tials of certain PSS, the perceived risks and benefits of implementing PSS to improve 
material efficiency, as well as economic savings on the company level more transpa-
rent for decision-makers. Such an approach structures and simplifies the process of 
finding the most appropriate PSS [11] [12]. 
To fulfill the aforementioned requirements of assessing the different PSS in an ob-
jective and transparent way, the outranking method PROMETHEE was chosen. This 
ranks the different alternatives according to the criteria and preferences of the decision-
maker. One of the advantages of PROMETHEE is the simultaneous consideration of 
quantitative and qualitative criteria. Moreover, PROMETHEE allows the decision-
maker to take vague, incomplete, incomparable or even contradictory information and 
thus preferences into consideration due to the possibility to define threshold values, 
strict preferences, indefinite preferences and indifferences. This is especially useful if 
the decision-maker does not possess exact information about the alternatives. Another 
benefit of applying PROMETHEE is the avoidance of compensation effects. Accor-
dingly, the advantages of one item do not compensate the disadvantages of another, 
and important information remains visible. This may result in different alternatives 
being incomparable and – as a consequence – lead to only a partial ranking of the  
alternatives. However, the aim of PROMETHEE is not to identify the optimal alterna-
tive, but rather any suitable alternative which matches the decision criteria and  

144

preferences of the decision-makers. Thus, the method delivers a transparently de-
scribed ranking of the alternatives based on a well-structured decision process. 
PROMETHEE is a multi-criteria decision aid method, one of the so-called outrank-
ing methods, and is one of the multi attribute decision making tools (MADM). Hence, 
each of the finite number of alternatives is evaluated regarding the different decision 
criteria and preferences of the decision-maker. Based on this assessment, the different 
alternatives – in this case of PSS – are (partially) ranked to choose the most appropri-
ate alternative [13] [14]. This is achieved by a pair-wise comparison of the alterna-
tives concerning the different criteria [15] [16]. 
Figure 2 shows the conceptual approach of a decision support tool for PSS based 
on PROMETHEE. The development and definition of decision criteria is the first and 
one of the most crucial steps in constructing the assessment tool, as the quality of the 
final decision is significantly influenced by the determination of the decision criteria. 
Thus, it is essential to have carefully elaborated criteria that cover all the aspects of 
the decision to introduce a PSS [17]. The following requirements need to be met: The 
decision criteria need to be easily understandable, measurable, free of redundancies, 
and contribute significantly to the decision. Furthermore, the criteria need to be ba-
lanced regarding completeness and conciseness as well as simplicity and complexity 
[18] [19]. 
 
Fig. 2. Conceptual Approach of a Decision Support Tool based on PROMETHEE 
Once the decision criteria have been selected, PROMETHEE allows the decision-
makers to indicate their individual preferences by weighting them. Weights are as-
signed to each criterion, such that the overall sum is one or 100 percent.  
This step is followed by the description and evaluation of the different PSS alterna-
tives with respect to the defined criteria. The logic of the outranking method 
PROMETHEE then ranks the assessed alternatives according to the determined val-
ues and the weighting of the decision criteria.  
PROMETHEE compares different alternatives with respect to the identified crite-
ria. As this ranking does not yield an optimal solution, the results have to be dis-
cussed. A sensitivity analysis should be applied to test the stability of the results  
according to the weighting of the criteria and to demonstrate the consequences of any 
change in weighting.  
To sum up, the structured approach simplifies the decision-making process of 
choosing an expedient PSS, which is economically and ecologically attractive.

PSS and Raw Material Efficiency 
3.1 
PSS and Their Impact on Raw Material Efficiency 
Raw materials are the basis for value creation in Germany’s industrial society. Cur-
rently, there is an annual demand for 1.4 bn tons of abiotic raw materials in Germany2 
[20]. For a long time, this was not a major problem, but is now receiving more interest 
because of the international competition in purchasing raw materials [21]. Resource 
and especially raw material efficiency are therefore the object of multiple scientific 
projects focusing on resource-efficient production systems in the manufacturing in-
dustry. Implementing service-based business models is one strategic option to tackle 
the challenge of improving raw material efficiency.  
The research into service-oriented business models is characterized by many dif-
ferent terms, e. g. servitization [22], functional sales [23] or performance-based con-
tracting [24]. The business concepts underlying these terms describe a stand-alone 
solution which contains the combination of a minimum of one product and one ser-
vice, is ready for the market and aims to fulfill specific customer needs [25] [26]. 
Within the research area dedicated to sustainability issues, these service-business 
relations between suppliers and their customers are predominantly referred to as PSS. 
PSS concepts can be structured and designed in multiple ways [27]. Their key ob-
jective is to support customers in the daily use of the products (e. g. plant and machi-
nery) by offering complementary services or – one step further – by assuming the risk 
for the production process (e. g. build-own-operate-model) and being paid for the 
production results. This frees the customer from tasks which are not related to the 
core business. The business model itself changes from a transaction-based concept to 
a relationship-based [28]. Unlike traditional business concepts, their added value con-
sists of “providing functionality rather than products” [29]. Hockerts [30] claims that 
PSS are superior market solutions compared to the traditional selling of products. 
The literature review showed that PSS reduce environmental impacts and positive-
ly influence sustainable development through the induced shift in incentives in the 
direction of dematerialization [31]. In traditional business concepts, the supplier 
wants to increase the volume of materials sold, whereas the customer wants to de-
crease the volume of materials used. In contrast, PSS offer the possibility to increase 
the value of the service for both parties involved. The supplier is remunerated for the 
service provided and not for the volume delivered [5]. Reiskin et al. [5] call this phe-
nomenon “decoupling volume from profitability”. Other advantages of PSS are that 
the provider possesses a more specialized knowledge, e. g. special engineering com-
petencies, which lead to a more efficient use of the product, or an intensified usage of 
the products.

3.2 
Barriers to and Opportunities of PSS 
Despite the benefits of PSS in increasing raw material efficiency, the usage of PSS in 
resource-intensive industries is still low. In the literature, various barriers and risks 
which hamper the diffusion of PSS are described, such as the difficulties new suppli-
ers of PSS face when entering the market due to a lack of information about life cycle 
costs and other parameters of the equipment’s operational phase. This is especially the 
case for customized solutions [32] [33]. Moreover, the transfer of experiences and 
information from customers to PSS providers is rather hesitant, because customers 
fear the loss of technological core competencies – and as a consequence – a threat to 
their competitive edge. This is particularly true for PSS which focus on harnessing the 
potentials offered by process optimization [33]. 
Expert interviews conducted in resource-intensive industries, such as steel and 
metal production, the chemical as well as the recycling industry, revealed a similar 
picture [8]: In all three sectors, the loss of know-how was mentioned as a perceived 
risk. Potential customers fear the loss of their competitive advantage, if PSS affect 
their core competencies. Amongst others, the perceived creation of a dependency on 
the supplier was commonly stated as a barrier to PSS. The interviewees assume the 
reliability and availability of the PSS provider is not guaranteed and that this can lead 
to severe production outages. 
Those interviewed in resource-intensive industries were also questioned about the 
opportunities of PSS [8]. One advantage mentioned was that the provider of PSS pos-
sesses better know-how about non-core processes than their customers. Moreover 
such suppliers already have the specialized equipment needed and the technological 
core competencies for using it at their disposal. This reduces the demand for qualifi-
cations at the customers, and allows them to focus on their core competencies and 
increases their flexibility. Other advantages of PSS mentioned by the interviewees are 
cost savings, fewer quality problems and a long-lasting business relationship between 
PSS customer and supplier.

An Assessment Approach to Raw Material-Efficient PSS 
As already indicated, PSS are a means – apart from conventional technical process 
enhancements – to harness the raw material efficiency potential in resource-intensive 
industries. However, as was detected in the expert interviews [9], there is still a lack 
of awareness of these potentials. A useful decision support tool for companies to faci-
litate the introduction of PSS is the multi-criteria approach based on PROMETHEE 
described in Section 2, which takes the opportunities and perceived risks of PSS into 
account. In the following, the decision criteria needed to assess PSS focusing on raw 
material efficiency in resource-intensive industries are identified and derived from 
expert interviews [9] and the relevant literature. 
To consider all the aspects that need to be reflected in the decision process, the de-
cision criteria should be aligned with universal company targets as shown in Figure 3. 
The overall value targets, such as profitability or productivity, are operationalized 
with factual targets, which are classified as performance, financial, leadership and 

 
Increased Raw Material Efficiency through Product-Service Systems 
147 
 
organizational as well as social and ecological goals. These four factual targets are 
then captured by the identified decision criteria, which will be introduced in the fol-
lowing sections.

4.1 
Performance Goals 
Process performance is an important aspect in the application of resource-intensive 
production value chains. Experts pointed out that technical processes already show a 
high degree of optimization and that high capacity utilization rates are needed in such 
asset-intensive industries. Reliability and availability as main drivers of down times 
contribute significantly to process performance. As a consequence, the evaluation of a 
PSS is based on aspects such as reliability [9] [36], availability [37] [38], robustness 
towards peaks (bottlenecks) [9], possible degree of process standardization [38], tech-
nical and operational risks [39] and the capacity utilization rate of existing and newly 
established facilities [9] [40]. Additionally, the robustness of the overall production 
system and a clear definition of responsibilities with respect to quality measures at 
process interfaces are taken into account [40]. 
4.2 
Financial Goals 
Costs are obviously another important aspect. Bearing in mind that some experts 
stated PSS do not necessarily lead to cost reductions [9], a thorough cost analysis of 
assets and processes is required covering the whole life cycle. A total cost of owner-
ship approach is beneficial here as this covers all life cycle costs [9] [41]. When com-
paring the costs of PSS with a traditional business model, internal overhead expenses 
need to be taken into account. The discount of values is advantageous with respect to 
the timely distribution of cash inflows and outflows. In addition, the one-time costs of 
designing and setting up a PSS [36] [41] [42], coordination and control costs [5] [36],

investments [43], lower capital costs due to a reduction of the required capital com-
mitments, changes in liquidity [36] [40] [44] and shifts in the share of fixed and vari-
able costs [38] [40] [45] all impact the assessment result. To sum up, this criterion has 
advantages due to the increased transparency of all the relevant costs on a life cycle 
basis [40] [44] [45]. 
4.3 
Leadership and Organizational Goals 
The experts named dependency on the provider as one of the major concerns of estab-
lishing a PSS [9]. Certainly, bargaining power is an important influence when deter-
mining the properties of a PSS. Oligopolistic or monopolistic market structures might 
be a barrier. Looking at a selection of alternative suppliers before signing long-term 
contracts reduces this risk. Furthermore, a carefully designed and reviewed contrac-
tual regulation helps to avoid such dependencies. However, apart from this dependen-
cy [9] [39] [43], many authors suggest that passing on responsibilities from the  
customer company to the PSS provider offers increased flexibility [9] [37] [44]. This 
area of concern requires an elaborate discussion and assessment. 
Experts commonly see the usage of external expertise as a potential driver for a de-
cision in favor of PSS. More and more advanced technologies and the related process 
know-how are adapted by specialized companies [43]. Therefore, it is necessary to 
assess the potential benefits of the technical capabilities gained [36] [44] [40]. Due to 
the incentive structure of PSS, the customer and the provider are often eager to ex-
pand the existing expertise cooperatively [36] [43]. Hence, the assessment should help 
to identify a PSS which is best able to achieve the listed benefits. In many publica-
tions the access to external know-how is described as advantageous in the context of 
using third party offerings [9] [36] [37]. 
In contrast to the acquisition of know-how and profiting from external expertise, 
loss of internal know-how is a commonly cited reason for ruling out the usage of PSS 
in the expert interviews. PSS have to be integrated smoothly into processes and this 
sometimes requires the transfer of internal know-how to the service provider. The 
situation might also occur, in which internal employees are no longer able to manage 
certain processes. This certainly relates to the aspect of dependency. The knowledge 
that certain know-how will have to be outsourced requires a proactive handling of 
risks, e. g. through a comprehensive contractual agreement. This is also a common 
argument in the literature [9] [38] [45]. 
Experts pointed out that, in the long run, decision-makers have a strong interest in 
securing future competitiveness. The positive influence of PSS on this aspect can be 
subsumed as strategic utility [46]. One strategic concept ensuring competitiveness is 
the concentration on the customers’ core competencies [9] [36] [45]. Therefore, the 
PSS has to be assessed with regard to this demand. Besides this often mentioned as-
pect, the enhanced ability to react to changes [36] [40] is listed in various publications. 
As a result, responsiveness is considered in the operationalization of the decision crite-
ria. The advantage of smaller organizational units can be taken into account [38] [40] 
[45] with respect to their beneficial properties regarding coordinating, organizing and 
planning. Other positive influences such as the customer-satisfaction-orientation of the

149 
 
PSS provider [38], the transfer of risks to the PSS provider [38], increased innovative-
ness [39] [40], an improved image [44], reduced internal transaction costs [40],  
increased cost awareness [40], optimized depth of added value [40], competitive diffe-
rentiation [40], reduced warranty and liability issues and stabilized business relations 
should also be captured and assessed regarding their impact on increased competitive-
ness [9] [39] [40]. Furthermore, it needs to be evaluated whether the aspects contribut-
ing to long-term competitiveness are outweighed by others such as the employees’ 
refusal to accept the PSS, the interruption of related processes or reduced informal 
communication [38]. 
4.4 
Social and Ecological Goals 
As explained in the introduction, material efficiency is very important due to ecologi-
cal goals, regulatory requirements and potential cost savings. Particularly in resource-
intensive production systems, rising material prices result in an increased leverage 
effect of percentage material reductions. Advanced technology and process know-
how and above all the expediently designed incentive structure of a PSS have the 
potential to improve material efficiency. While many of the other criteria have been 
handled in the literature, the aspect of material efficiency is rarely mentioned [9] [40]. 
This can be primarily attributed to the subordinate importance of this issue in the past.

Conclusions and the Need for Further Research 
This paper shows that PSS are a strategic option to increase raw material efficiency. 
Nevertheless, the market share of PSS is still relatively low. To support and make the 
complex decision process of implementing PSS easier, this paper suggests and dis-
cusses an assessment approach based on the multi-criteria decision method 
PROMETHEE. This allows the assessment of the potential of specific PSS in a trans-
parent way by considering the perceived risks and benefits. 
In this paper, the decision criteria were determined as a first step towards develop-
ing a decision support tool covering all the aspects of the economic, ecological and 
technical objectives. The criteria are aligned with the general targets of the company, 
which are classified in four categories: performance, financial, leadership and orga-
nizational and social and ecological. To measure and compare the effects of different 
PSS focusing on raw material efficiency with the traditional business model, the fol-
lowing seven criteria are used: Performance is evaluated by the process performance; 
the financial goals are defined by the total cost of ownership, and the social and eco-
logical perspective is covered by the achievements regarding material efficiency. The 
fourth category, leadership and organizational goals, is split into four criteria, depen-
dency on the provider, usage of expertise, loss of know-how and securing long-term 
competitiveness. 
Future research should focus on the development of the complete decision support 
model based on PROMETHEE and testing various case studies to validate its appli-
cability.

Abstract. Spare parts are the key-modules by the realization of technical Prod-
uct-Service Systems (PSS). To gain the sustainable realization of PSS, the 
usage of original spare parts is necessary. Nevertheless, numerous enterprises 
operate in the market by offering counterfeit spare parts and numerous custom-
ers using these spare parts. This problem, known as product piracy, has tre-
mendous consequences for manufacturers of capital goods. Existing strategies 
usually focus on the potential counterfeiters and attempt to thwart their capabili-
ties. However, this ignores that the main causes for product piracy are internally 
induced and self-inflicted. The approach quantifies, evaluates and reduces these 
risks for spare parts step by step in the engineering process of the product. 
Keywords: product piracy, spare parts, piracy risk, cost-benefit analysis.

Introduction 
Spare parts are the key-modules by the realization of technical Product-Service Sys-
tems (PSS). To gain the sustainable realization of PSS, the usage of original spare 
parts is necessary [1]. PSS is defined as a complex physical product core, dynamically 
enhanced along its life cycle, by non-physical services and spare parts [2].  
Nevertheless, numerous enterprises operate in the global market by using the  
industrial achievements of innovative manufacturers in an unauthorized way. This 
phenomenon, popularly known as product piracy, has tremendous consequences for 
manufacturers of capital goods. Spare parts are a particularly frequent target of coun-
terfeit due to their technical simplicity and market volume. 
Concepts current in the field of product piracy usually focus on potential counter-
feiters as the source of the problem, and try to face their capabilities by protective 
measures [3]. However, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) do not realize that 
product piracy in many cases is self-inflicted by their own enterprise structure. In 
these cases, the corporate risk of getting counterfeited is induced by internally made 
decisions. This situation is termed self-inflicted product piracy [1].  
In this paper, the emergence of self-inflicted product piracy is pointed out and it 
presents an approach to quantify, evaluate and reduce internally induces piracy risks 
for spare parts in the engineering process of the product.

Self-inflicted Product Piracy 
2.1 
Product Piracy 
Product piracy is the unauthorized use of brands, technical inventions, designs and/ or 
know-how protected either by any intellectual property right or a contract or the gen-
eral laws against unfair competition. Unauthorized means, use without the permission 
or the knowledge of the OEM, including the reproduction of any good in a way that 
closely imitates protected items, and thus that may mislead the customer. If a com-
petitor offers an imitated spare part that fits to the PSS from the OEM, the OEM has 
to check whether the imitation is illegal (product piracy) or legal [1]. The risk of 
product piracy for an OEM is characterized by causes and effects.  
 
Fig. 1. Causes and effects of piracy risks [1] 
Consecutively, several causes of piracy risks are quoted. Once the critical market 
volume of a product is exceeded, its imitation becomes attractive for product piracy 
[4]. Fixed costs include both development costs and adaption costs for reverse engi-
neering, fixed costs allocated in the manufacturing process, and marketing costs. The 
lower these fixed costs the greater is the attractiveness for product piracy [5]. Identifi-
cation of product piracy is hampered by several factors including the heterogeneity of 
worldwide markets, the huge number and variety of spare parts and the plurality of 
suppliers, customers, dealers and competitors [6]. Further causes of product piracy are 
the price premium of the product [5], an uncontrolled know-how transfer [7], and 
criminal organization structures [8].  
Resulting effects for the manufacturer are, for example, a decline in sales, price 
erosion, unjustified product liability, and the loss of image and advances in innova-
tion. Resulting effects for the customer are, for example, health and security conse-
quences for the machine operator, the risk of a machinery breakdown, and increased 
maintenance costs [9].  
The identification and avoidance of internally causes and the associated piracy 
risks are addressed in this paper (Figure 1).

2.2 
Internally Induced Piracy Risks 
There is a conflict of interest between the engineering process of the product and the 
protection of spare parts against product piracy (Figure 3). 
 
Fig. 2. Self-inflicted product piracy by spare parts 
The main requirements of the product engineering process such as managing prod-
uct complexity, as saving costs and time, and as developing quality, foster product 
piracy in the after sales market. The technical solutions which are implemented to 
meet those requirements cause piracy risks in after sales. These kinds of piracy risks 
are internally induced and avoidable. This knowledge has emerged from a 4 years 
working group, with leading providers of PSS out of the construction equipment and 
agriculture industry and with the Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Produc-
tion Systems (FBK) in Kaiserslautern. For example, two strategies are typically used 
to manage product complexity: standardization of the product structure and reduction 
of the vertical range of manufacture (outsourcing of complexity) [10]:  
• Outsourcing of complexity necessarily entails outsourcing of contracted know-how 
to cooperation partners. This runs the risk that the supplier may use the transferred 
know-how to manufacture and to sell the spare part without informing the OEM 
[11]. Especially, if the company chooses its cooperation partners primarily under 
cost aspects. Suppliers with an own distribution structure are afflicted with a high 
piracy risk. Also disloyal dealers or service providers can misuse the transferred 
and contracted know-how to order counterfeited components from independent 
manufacturers [12].  
• Standardization focuses on increasing the reusability of equal parts with the reali-
zation of standardized interfaces. This contains the risk that the market volumes of 
the spare parts increase. Additionally, the cost risks by counterfeiting that standar-
dized part decreases [13]. Especially, standard parts which are assembled branch-
wide or even industry-wide are afflicted with a high piracy risk [14].

In sum, we found different types of internally induced piracy risks by spare parts. 
Three categories of internally induced piracy risks are identified and addressed: part-
ner, customer and product. These categories are illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
Fig. 3. Categories of internally induced piracy risks 
Many types of cooperation partners present piracy risks, including suppliers, de-
velopment partners, service partners and dealers. The risk is that typically a business 
partner uses a protected industrial achievement of the OEM in an unauthorized way. 
With regard to customers, the piracy risk is that they will buy counterfeit products 
from product pirates. This risk typically results from the OEM creating an unwanted 
demand in the market. The risk category product refers to the imitation attractiveness 
of the product or the simplicity to imitate the product. Here are summarized the risks 
that the market entry barriers are so low that the product pirates can counterfeit prod-
ucts without bearing own risks.

Prevention of Self-inflicted Product Piracy 
To prevent self-inflicted product piracy by spare parts, it is necessary to identify, to 
quantify, to evaluate, and to reduce internally induced piracy risks, already in the 
engineering process of the primary product.  
3.1 
Quantification and Evaluation of Piracy Risks 
To quantify and to evaluate piracy risks, the probability of its occurrence has to be 
related with the gross loss of product piracy. The probability of piracy occurrence is 
determined through the quantification of the causes by a rating number between 1 and 
10. The gross loss of product piracy is determined through the quantification of the 
effects of product piracy by an impact factor. The resulting net-piracy risk is the

outcome of the multiplication of the probability rating number with the impact factor. 
Finally, the net-piracy risk has to be evaluated.  
Probability of Piracy Risk Occurrence. The probability of piracy risk occurrence is 
calculated with several morphological boxes. Within each morphological box several 
internally induced piracy risks are clustered. Furthermore, the morphological boxes 
are clustered to the risk categories product, customer and partner (Figure 4).  
 
Fig. 4. Probability of piracy risk occurrence 
The parameters of the morphological boxes are risk parameters that stand for sev-
eral internally induced piracy risks. The characteristics of the risk parameters are the 
alternative solutions in a morphological box. The characteristics fulfill two tasks: 
• The characteristics are underlined with rating numbers between 1 and 10 that stand 
for a specific high or low probability of piracy occurrence. Rating number 1 sym-
bolizes a low probability and rating number 10 a high probability of piracy occur-
rence. In doing so, with determining the characteristics, the probability of piracy 
occurrence is calculated. 
• Furthermore, the different characteristics of a risk parameter also show alternative 
solutions to reduce the probability of piracy occurrence.  
In Figure 5,6 and 7 are pointed out the morphological boxes to estimate the degree of 
standardization, the degree of non-integration of spare part additional benefits, and the 
degree of non-cooperation suitability of the supplier.  
To estimate the degree of standardization, the in Figure 5 pointed out risk parame-
ters and related risk characteristics are determined. For example, has to be estimated 
the novelty grade of the design task. Using in a new machine generation the equal 
design of a part as in the initial machine generation, contains the piracy risk that

product pirates have an extended counterfeiting time without changing anything. Fur-
thermore, has to be estimated how common in the market are the geometrical and 
material characteristics and the surface of the part to the machine. If other manufac-
turers in the branch or even in other industries using the same characteristics or the 
same interface, the market volume of that spare part is obviously higher if the OEM is 
the only one with a technical specification.  
 
Fig. 5. Degree of standardization 
To estimate the degree of non-integration of spare part additional benefits, the in 
Figure 6 pointed out risk parameters and related risk characteristics are determined. A 
spare part with less additional benefit contains a higher piracy risk then a spare part 
with several additional benefits. For example spare part related additional benefits are 
benefits in logistic (e. g. lower transport costs), benefits in the handling of the spare 
part during maintenance (e. g. maintenance time, weight, ergonomic), and benefits in 
the usage of the machinery through the spare part (e. g. saving resources).

To estimate the degree of non-cooperation suitability of the supplier, the in Figure 
7 pointed out risk parameters and related risk characteristics are determined. For ex-
ample is a supplier selling already actively several spare parts in several important 
after sales markets of the OEM, less suitable than a supplier without any role in the 
after sales business. Furthermore, are the sale and service structure of the supplier risk 
parameters that have to be estimated. Suppliers with a direct and intensive customer 
contact contain the risk that they sell components as spare parts to the customer with-
out informing the OEM. Also the location of the supplier and herein the existence of 
secure property rights in a country is relevant [15]. 
 
Fig. 7. Degree of non-cooperation suitability of the supplier 
With this approach, the probability of piracy occurrence can be quantified and re-
duced step by step in the engineering process of the primary product. The rating num-
bers of each risk parameter can be related with the impact factor to a net-piracy risk. 
Furthermore, the rating numbers of each morphological box can be related with the 
impact factor. The rating number of a morphological box is the average of the risk 
parameters rating numbers. Finally, can be quantified a total rating number for piracy 
risk occurrence out of the average of the morphological boxes rating numbers. 
Gross Loss of Piracy Risks. The resulting effects of product piracy have conse-
quences for the sustainable usage of product-service system. This includes conse-
quences for the manufacturer, for the customer who bought and uses this spare part, 
for the environment, and for the health and security of the machine operator. The 
consequences for a sustainable usage of the product-service system represent the

gross loss of product piracy and have to be calculated with an impact factor. The cal-
culation of the impact factor is an expert-based estimation of the consequences for 
each of the following categories: 
• The total cost of ownership (TCO) from the customer relating to the part 
• A possible breakdown of the machinery due to a failure of the part  
• The security, and the health risk of the machine operator due to a failure of the part 
• The image of the OEM relating to the part 
• The OEM volume of sale and profit of the part 
• The Recyclability of the part, 
• The influences on the environment (e. g. emissions, resources) through the part 
To quantify the impact factor, the analyzing team has to estimate several impacts of 
the consequences for the categories if the customer will maintain a counterfeit part 
instead of the sustainable original one. The range goes from a low impact counted 
with 1 till a high impact counted with 10. Each category is described with several 
characteristics which assist the estimation of the impact. For example, characteristics 
in the category “health risk” are noise, ergonomic, inhalation of toxic, or harmful 
vapors and vibration. The deposited characteristics of the category “security risk” are 
squeezing, cutting, hitting, and burning. The total impact factor is the average of the 
estimated impacts out of the categories. 
Evaluation of the Net-Piracy Risk. To quantify and to evaluate the piracy risk of a 
spare part, the rating number for the probability of piracy risk occurrence has to be 
multiplied with the estimated impact factor (Figure 8).

The range of resulting net-piracy risk goes from 1 till 100. A net-piracy risk small-
er than 30 is optimal. A net-piracy risk between 31 and 50 is determined as a medium 
high piracy risk. The need to reduce a medium high piracy risk depends on the com-
pany strategy and is obligatory. A net-piracy risk higher than 51 is critical and has to 
be reduced with appropriate measures.  
3.2 
Reducing of Piracy Risks 
Measures to Reduce Piracy Risks. To reduce a piracy risk the probability of its oc-
currence and within this the degree of its causes has to be focused. Therefore several 
measures are determined. The target of de-standardization is to reduce the market 
volume of the spare part and with that the imitation attractiveness. At first, in the en-
gineering process of a new machine generation, a spare part with a high impact factor, 
should be a new design task. Furthermore, additional functions or functions from 
other components could be integrated to the part concept. Also, the manufacturing of 
the part could be de-standardized, by using not procurable materials or by changing 
geometrical or material characteristics that are not manufacturable with standard ma-
chines or tools. In addition, changing the geometry of the connection type is another 
measure in order to unique the spare part. A smart way to change the interface is, 
changing it by ensure a reverse exchangeability of the new interface also in the initial 
interface.  
 
Fig. 9. Integration of spare part related additional benefits 
To reduce the degree of non-integration of spare part additional benefits, spare part 
related requirements have to be integrated in the design task. Each component of the 
primary product fulfils its function (base benefit) to the function of the entire ma-
chine. The target is, in addition to that base benefit of the component, integrating 
spare part related additional benefits. Examples of spare part related additional bene-
fits are already pointed out. A spare part related additional benefit must be configured 
in the way that the entire perceived benefit of the machine increases as well (Figure 
9). Original spare parts from the OEM must be significant different to third party 
components that fit to the OEM machine as a spare part.  
To reduce the degree of non-cooperation suitability of the supplier, cooperation 
suitable suppliers have to be chosen in early steps of the engineering process. Beside 
standard criteria like quality, delivery time, costs etc. the risk that suppliers could sell 
the part without informing the OEM has to be integrated in the supplier selection [12].

Evaluation of the Measures. To evaluate the measures, relations of the costs and the 
benefits due to the measure have to be analyzed. Therefore, it is necessary to deter-
mine and evaluate the additional costs and benefits in each phase of the product life-
cycle. This has to be done for the product lifecycle in the perspective from the OEM 
and from the customer (Figure 10).  
 
Fig. 10. Cost-benefit analysis 
3.3 
Integration in the Engineering Process 
The engineering process is separated in several phases, starting with a planning and 
definition phase up to the phase start of production (SOP). The result of the engineer-
ing process is an intellectual product with all required product, production and service 
documents, resources and facilities to start with the series production of the PSS [16]. 
The development of the intellectual product happens step by step. Therefore, also the 
quantification, evaluation and the reduction of piracy risks has to be done step by step 
in the engineering process. The approach to quantify, evaluate and reduce piracy risks 
of a spare part is to multiply the rating number for the probability of piracy risk occur-
rence with the estimated impact factor. This has to be done step by step in the engi-
neering process with the rating numbers of each risk parameter (Figure 11).  
The quantification of the total piracy risk of the new machine generation has to be 
done at the end of the engineering process with the rating numbers of the morphologi-
cal boxes. At the beginning of the engineering process should be determined the  
piracy risk of the old machine generation.

Fig. 11. Integration of piracy preventing in engineering process 
Between the engineering process are determined several piracy gates. These gates 
are located between the engineering phases and review the piracy risk progress of the 
engineering process for spare parts. The prerequisite to determine all risk characteris-
tics is the knowledge about market and piracy activities in the after sales. Therefore 
has to be gathered and provided piracy and market information in the market phase of 
the PSS.

Conclusion 
Product piracy in the capital goods industry is a corporate risk which addresses in 
particular the spare parts business of OEM and hinders the sustainable realization of 
PSS. The causes for these risks are multi-faceted. Especially concepts focusing the 
capabilities of imitators, which are characterized as external induced piracy risks, 
have been developed during the last years. But in many cases OEM do not realize that 
product piracy is also internally induced by their own enterprise structure and self-
inflicted within the product engineering process. 
The presented approach identifies the causes and main drivers of internally induced 
piracy risks for spare parts. Furthermore, the approach evaluates a net-piracy risk by 
quantifying the probability of piracy occurrence and the gross loss of product piracy. 
To prevent self-inflicted product piracy, the approach points out some measures to 
reduce piracy risks. Finally, preventing self-inflicted product piracy is integrated in 
the engineering process.

Abstract. For an organization to become sustainable, turning towards PSSs 
seems appealing. However, the PSS approach is rather a support in this respect, 
not the solution itself. Although there has been lately a strong focus on 
methodologies and approaches of designing competitive PSSs, tackling with 
emotional aspects of functionalities to be provided is still a challenge. This 
paper addresses this issue by introducing a mean of sketching such unique 
functionalities and even triggering customer desires. Thus, sustainability is 
envisaged in two ways: (one) by making customers loyal in a constructive and 
creative way, and (second) by fitting up the SME with a distinctive (and 
difficult-to-copy) offer. The approach in this paper is applied within a case 
study in the domain of railway modelling, in which customers - apart from 
willing to spend much money for their hobby - are extremely demanding, and 
the emotional component of their buying behaviour is predominant. 
Keywords: sustainability, functionality design, emotional aspects of 
functionalities.

Introduction 
From its very beginning, the product-service system concept has been linked to 
sustainability. Together with sustainable design, production and consumption, PSSs 
accompany the paradigm shift towards functional economy [1-2]. Nevertheless, the 
focus on providing functionalities, instead of traditional products and services, raises 
new challenges in terms of competitiveness. Moreover, the more and more visible 
customer emotional connection concerning the value and benefits of a company's 
offer further complicates things [3]. 
Sustainability means to be able to last or continue for a long time [4]. It implies 
three major aspects - environmental, societal and economical [5-6], which need to be 
carefully balanced [7].  
To sum up, the long-term competitiveness of a business determines its sustainability, 
and the PSS approach is an appealing framework for supporting “modern” requirements 

166 
M. Fulea et al. 
like increased product or service customization or much shorter product (or service) life 
cycles, which in turn determine competitiveness [4].  
However, being competitive also implies providing those functionalities that create 
satisfaction to the customer, while being specific to the provider and hard to be 
copied. Moreover, domains where customers buy products and services rather on an 
emotional basis further complicate the “equation” of sustainability. Therefore, 
although the PSS approach is a great support for business sustainability, it raises new 
challenges in terms of designing adequate functionalities. This is the case mostly for 
smaller businesses acting in creative domains, where the buying behaviour of their 
customers is more and more determined on an emotional basis. 
To date, it is commonly accepted that product-service systems are able to support 
manufacturers to differentiate their products by meeting diversely segmented 
customer needs in a sustainable manner [8]. In the same time, several sources point 
out the emotional reaction as the key driver of buying decisions [3] [9] [10]. 
Additionally, they state that customers emotionally engaged to service providers may 
be more willing to tolerate inherent service or quality shortfalls [3] which occur 
mostly with new, innovative products and/or services, especially in creative domains. 
Customer experience is widely accepted as being a key to a business' sustainability 
[11-12], being even considered the next competitive battleground [13]. However, 
managers mostly focus on measuring customer satisfaction, although it is more an 
outcome. Unfortunately, customer satisfaction surveys do not capture the emotional 
effect of the service interaction or the value that customers perceive from it. Many 
factors drive satisfaction and loyalty, based on a mixture of expectations, needs and 
reactions to the organisation and the perceived value received by the customer [3]. 
In general, tackling with emotional aspects of functionalities to be provided is a 
challenge; with PSSs, this challenge becomes critical, especially in terms of business 
sustainability. To address it, this paper focuses on a key aspect of a PSS life-cycle – 
its design - providing a mean of sketching unique functionalities and even triggering 
needs or desires of the customer.

The Problem 
The increasing significance of knowledge to all aspects of economic production, 
distribution and consumption is strongly correlated to the creative industries [14], and 
creativity has become a key input into all sectors where design and content determine 
competitive advantages [14-15]. Lately, creative industries have received much 
interest, as organizations acting in creative domains face specific challenges, among 
which the emotional aspects of customers’ behaviour are increasingly important.  
Advertising, architecture, arts (also performing arts), crafts, design, fashion, 
software, publishing, and mass-media are all creative industries [16] [14]. However, 
there are other highly creative domains, with a niche market, like railway modelling 
(dating from 1910), requiring highly-skilled actors from domains like software, arts, 
architecture, design, and automation. Being superficially treated by many people like 
a hobby or simply toy stuff, railway modelling can be seen as an industry itself, with 

 
Managing Emotional Aspects of PSS Functionalities for Sustainability 
167 
many model producers, hobbyists, clubs, magazines, and exhibitions worldwide. 
Aggregate figures regarding the railway model market size are difficult to be found, 
but – to get a glimpse on costs and extent – the Miniatur Wunderland permanent 
exhibition in Hamburg, Germany (with over 1.2 million visitors in 2011) represents 
an approx. EUR 12 million investment [17], while the railway model market in the 
US was estimated for 2010 at $424 million (and being on an ascending trend) [18]. 
Such niche domains raise even more challenges for businesses striving for 
sustainability: companies are usually small, human resource should be highly 
qualified and dedicated, structured approaches in management are rather uncommon, 
the products and services are expensive and emotional buying is highly predominant 
among customers. There are several additional factors that affect competitiveness 
(and therefore business sustainability) in such domains: technology dynamics, high 
demands (e.g. realistic models and landscapes, realistic automation), and buying 
behaviour unpredictability. PSSs might be a great support for such businesses; 
however, their design should systematically address the issues highlighted above. 
The target group of such businesses is – to some extent – atypical. As such 
domains are specific to passionate and somehow “unpredictable” people, very few 
can estimate the amount of spending, the degree of involvement or the knowledge 
they will accumulate in the domain. Merchandisers cannot estimate such aspects 
either, so counting on specific customers can be an issue. 
To achieve results and fulfilment in such a domain, one needs to be extremely 
creative, technically skilled and open-minded. In railway modelling, for instance, 
buying model cars and engines is far from being satisfactory if tracks are laid on the 
floor; adequate scenery (landscape, region, historical period) is a must for many 
people. Building such scenery (and automating models) requires a lot of expertise and 
creativity, but – in case of success – fulfilment (which is a pure emotional aspect) is 
worth the money they invest.  
Merchandisers are directly affected by the (lack of) creativity and expertise of their 
customers. Simply playing with models, or just collecting them, might not be a 
motivation to invest in scenery products, tracks, turnouts or automation; on the other 
hand, a realistic diorama costs significantly more (possibly up to ten times) than the 
models themselves. 
Businesses within such domains are in general focused towards traditional sales 
(models, accessories, scenery elements) and related services (model personalization, 
maintenance and diorama building). No reference could be found to reveal a 
systematic orientation towards supporting customers to get more skilled, which in 
turn could significantly increase revenue and customer loyalty. Moreover, no 
competitive advantages can be identified within such business models; therefore, 
sustainability might be a serious issue. 
To conclude, the problems that such businesses face while striving for 
sustainability are – to a great extent – atypical. Less experienced customers do not 
generate enough revenue, experienced customers are extremely demanding and 
unpredictable, and the customer base is determined apparently only by chance, in an 
era in which entertainment alternatives abound. Turning towards PSS is an appealing 
alternative, but determining those functionalities to solve the above problems should 

168 
M. Fulea et al. 
be the real concern. This paper proposes a PSS design framework that systematically 
addresses the above issues, aiming towards business sustainability. 
3 
Current Approaches 
To identify the current approaches in designing PSSs towards business sustainability, 
along with design approaches regarding customer satisfaction and emotional buying, a 
survey was conducted both within the scientific literature and the community.  
Business sustainability requires investments made today for future results [2]. It 
requires a strategic approach of the way in which an organization's employees evolve, 
of how the organization understands its customers, their preferences, of how it makes 
them discover unexpected qualitative features of its product or service portfolio; and 
of how innovative and creative it is. Nowadays, only approaches at a very general 
level regarding PSS design for sustainability could be identified. For instance, in [19], 
designing PSSs for sustainability is tackled in terms of designing innovation strategies 
to shift the business focus from traditional product design towards PSS. While 
addressing sustainable PSS design ([20]), the design thinking concept is employed, 
stressing the importance of developing empathy for the people that will ultimately be 
impacted by the service or product being designed; however, it's more oriented 
towards rising awareness than towards the design process itself. Other identified 
approaches are similar to, or as general as, these ones. 
Regarding customer satisfaction, a method that allows designers to compare PSS 
design solutions in the conceptual stage, based on a customer satisfaction estimation 
procedure, is presented in [8]. It uses a non-linear value function (called the 
satisfaction-attribute function) to quantify customer satisfaction. As a support tool, 
customer experience modelling is approached in [11], aiming to represent the 
different aspects of customer experience (which determines customer satisfaction) in 
a holistic, diagrammatic representation. No further significant references have been 
found that approach customer satisfaction (or experience) within the PSS design 
process. 
It's worth noting that there are several approaches that effectively support the PSS 
design phase. However, in the particular context analysed in this paper, a new 
approach is needed with respect to the issues above.

The Methodology 
To address the issues highlighted in the previous session, a PSS concept design 
methodology is proposed, to help assess functionalities according to the emotional 
aspects they're linked with, and to trigger needs or desires of the customer (in terms of 
new functionalities), by employing methods like AFD [21] and ASIT [22]. The 
methodology has been developed in the railway modelling domain context, but it can 
be applied for shaping PSSs in any similar creative domain. Sustainability is 
envisaged through increasing the competitiveness of the PSS, determining customer 

 
Managing Emotional Aspects of PSS Functionalities for Sustainability 
169 
loyalty (making them “want more” in terms of functionalities that can be anticipated 
and designed accordingly), and making functionalities hard-to-be-copied. 
Step I. Examine characteristics of the target group (existing and possible 
customers) and determine four typologies – or personas [8] - that describe it: three 
typologies for customers (be they existing or potential) and one for passionate people 
in the community that participate in thematic clubs. Each persona should be described 
by a set of particularities. For instance, 'collectors' would be those customers that are 
very demanding in terms of rolling stock details, that are mainly looking for historical 
models, for rare items, and which are not that interested in running performance or 
stability. The reason for describing the persona regarding people in thematic clubs is 
in the context of raising awareness and triggering desires for functionalities; it will be 
further explained below. The outputs of the first step are the four sets of persona 
characteristics. 
Note: the authors have proposed a number of three (plus one) personas within this 
methodology, which is considered adequate, but more typologies can be used, if 
needed. However, this will result into a more elaborate work while applying the 
methodology. 
Step II. Formulate market needs the PSS will respond to, and define target 
functions according to the market needs (examples of target functions could be 
'increased realism', 'increased automation', 'scenery consistency', etc.). Using a 
concurrent approach, determine local solutions (local functional perspectives) in 
relation to each of the target functions [23-24]. The output of the second step is a local 
functionality set for each target function. 
Step III. Extend the local functionality sets to an exhaustive set of (possible or 
implementable) functionalities, using a systematic and creative approach; methods 
like AFD and ASIT can be employed. To support this highly creative step, specific 
search operations could be conducted; for instance image web search based on 
relevant keywords and their synonyms. The output of this step is an extensive list of 
functionalities (ideally, 'all one can dream of', given they are – or seem - 
implementable).  
Step IV. Formulate (and rank) criteria for assessing the functionalities identified in 
the previous step. For railway modelling, criteria should include – but not be limited 
to – uniqueness, attractiveness to customer, implementation difficulty, difficulty of 
being copied, degree to which it can trigger desire for other (related) functionalities, 
and implementation cost.  
Step V. Assess (rank) the extended set of functionalities, using the criteria from 
step IV, in the context of each persona's particularities. Separate analyses should be 
done from the perspective of each persona. For instance, automated routes might be 
less appealing to collectors, while for other personas this could more likely trigger the 
desire for other functionalities like realistic turnout switching. Choose, for each 
persona, the best ranked functionalities that, on one hand, are most adequate to suit 
the initial target functions, and – on the other hand – have the greatest potential of 
triggering the user's desire for other functionalities (being also “on the list”). From 
this point on, there will be a slightly different PSS sketch for each persona, as target 
functions will have different local functional perspectives (see step II).  

170 
M. Fulea et al. 
Starting with this step, technical aspects regarding functionality implementation 
should be considered. Only a small part of the functionalities identified in step III will 
be part of the (initial form of the) PSS, but, within its life-cycle, they should trigger 
the user's desire for other functionalities (also on the list in step III), which should be 
easily implementable from a technical point of view. 
Step VI. Based on information from the previous steps, local solutions should be 
aggregated into one final functional perspective for each PSS. Each PSS concept 
should be best suited for its corresponding persona in terms of wow-features and 
exciting-quality, and eventually competitiveness. 
Step VII. Perform a 9-Window analysis [25] for each functional perspective to 
sketch the future system, the future super-system and the future sub-system. The aim 
of this analysis is to support the identification of possible trends in terms of both 
customer expectations and technologies. The information obtained can be further used 
in step V (or even step I), in case of a spiral approach of the methodology. 
Four PSS concepts (expressed as functional perspectives) are the output of the 
methodology, out of which one corresponds to the persona describing community 
members forming thematic clubs. As mentioned in the introductory sections of this 
paper, emotional fulfilment in such domains is strongly dependent on one's creativity, 
technical skills and passion. These characteristics are usually “incubated” in thematic 
clubs, where members share experiences, perspectives, and learn from each other. 
Thematic clubs are an important opportunity for merchandisers (PSS providers) not 
only to sell, but to promote their expertise and competitive advantages. In return, 
thematic clubs usually need support for various events, such as exhibitions or contests.  
To improve the potential customer's experience in the domain, rather than wait for 
opportunities, a strategic partnership could be established between a PSS provider and 
a thematic club. The PSS concept developed with respect to the fourth persona would 
be the free-of-charge contribution of the PSS provider to the community; in turn, a 
great opportunity to learn about passions, skills, needs and wants of the representative 
target group (even trend setters) is opened. The authors of this paper believe that such 
a partnership is much more likely to be effective, in terms of understanding the target 
group, than market or customer satisfaction surveys. Having a PSS used by “top 
customers” in terms of skills and demand allows the understanding of both the 
rational and emotional aspects that drive the interaction with its functionalities. 
Moreover, having built-in functionalities that trigger the user's desire for other 
functionalities directly exposed to trend setters is a very effective way of promotion. 
To sum up, this methodology actively deals with emotional aspects of PSS 
functionalities, which means identifying, assessing and even triggering them. 
However, a significant amount of effort is required in this respect, and – for increased 
effectiveness – adaptation of business processes might be highly necessary.

Application Example 
This section presents the most relevant results of a case study in the railway 
modelling domain, in which the products and services of a merchandiser running a 

 
Managing Emotional Aspects of PSS Functionalities for Sustainability 
171 
“traditional” business are turned into a PSS, using the methodology and approach 
introduced in this paper.  
Step I. Four customer typologies (personas) were determined; for brevity, only one 
– the “thematic scenery modeller” – will be presented. This type of customers is 
mostly interested in diorama details, buying rolling stock according to a theme (be it 
modern railways, World War II themes, or the so-called “Epoch I”, up to 1925). He's 
usually skilled at landscaping, being less interested in automation or rolling stock 
running performance. 
Step II. The market needs, expressed as general requirements, are RQ1 – diorama to 
run trains on,  RQ2 – rolling stock, RQ3 – diorama and rolling stock maintenance, RQ4 
– control and automation, RQ5 – modifications allowed by users, RQ6 – user skill 
improvement. According to these market needs, the following target functions were 
being formulated:  TF1 - increased realism, TF2 - increased usability,  TF3 - increased 
automation,  TF4 – scenery consistency,  TF5 – short diorama building time,  TF6 – 
reduced costs. Using the approach in [23], local specifications have been determined 
for each target function. For exemplification, the following functionalities are part of 
the local solution for  TF1 - increased realism: (a) realistic trainsets, (b) theme-
consistent scenery elements (buildings, nature, track layout, etc.), (c) rolling stock 
weathering, (d) consistent signalling, (e) sound (and steam) modules for locomotives, 
(f) turnout realistic switching. 
Step III. Extending local functionality sets can be done either on an ad-hoc 
approach (by one's experience) or through specific methods (like AFD and ASIT). For 
instance, it's quite straightforward to extend the functionality (b) by identifying an 
exhaustive set of scenery elements: grass, bushes, trees, fences, paved roads, country 
roads, etc. for nature; non-circular track layouts, realistic trackbed (mix of differently 
coloured stones), bridges, tunnels, rail crossings, abandoned tracks, etc. for track 
layout and so on. However, many surprising possible functionalities may be 
discovered by using systematic methods. Two examples will be presented: one for the 
AFD and one for the ASIT method. 
III.a. The starting point of this example is (b.3.3) providing theme-consistent 
scenery elements – bridges. AFD will be applied in the attempt to determine more 
functionalities. The “standard” problem formulation could be “bridges may not keep 
tracks fixed in specific conditions”. The inverted problem formulation could be “how 
could a bridge not keep tracks in place?”; the inverted and amplified problem 
formulation could be “how could a bridge not keep tracks in place using available 
resources only?” The available resources are detailed in Table 1. 
Continuing with the AFD formalism, the result of the undesired phenomena is 
“unsteady track due to tension or vibrations”. 
Table 1. AFD – available resources

M. Fulea et al. 
The next AFD step is the determination of phenomena with a similar result. In this 
case, these could be: diorama exposed by intense sunlight (through a window, at a 
precise time of day), which may cause track deformation (and derailments), or 
diorama exposed by significant temperature variation (for instance placed near a 
heater), which may cause track dilatation (and derailments if passed over with high 
speed). 
The actual AFD analysis can stop here; several possible new functionalities can be 
inferred: (b.3.3.1) automatically have speed restrictions over bridges when a certain 
temperature variation is detected (this is related to TF3 - increased automation), 
(b.3.3.2) include, in the track layout, “run down” bridges, by applying adequate 
weathering (for instance by painting small bracks on piles) and speed restriction signs, 
(b.3.3.3) incorporate a sensor (and warning sound) for exposure in direct sunlight, 
(b.3.3.4) automatically speed down trains over “run down” bridges, and (b.3.3.5) 
automatically speed down (only) locomotives over “run down” bridges (the latter two 
are also related to TF3 - increased automation). 
Note: functionalities like (b.3.3.1), (b.3.3.4) and (b.3.3.5) can be very easily 
implemented, even after the diorama is completed and automated, if they are taken 
into account in the stage of PSS concept development. Otherwise, the costs for 
implementing them afterwards might be very high.  
III.b. The starting point for this second example is (b.2) providing theme-consistent 
nature elements. ASIT will be applied to identify new functionalities. The product, in 
this case, is “theme-consistent nature elements”, which is adapted to a season of 
choice. The problem world is formulated as follows: “the diorama is decorated with 
natural scenery elements (grass, trees, and flowers), but, after a period of time, it may 
become boring as it is too static”. The applied ASIT thinking tool, in this case, is 
breaking symmetry. The object that can be made asymmetrical is “nature elements”. 
The core idea is to change nature elements in accordance with the seasons. Dioramas 
are usually modular, to make them movable and to ease servicing. Diorama modules 
are usually rectangular supports made of wood or polystyrene, on top of which track 
and scenery elements are mounted (most often by gluing). The idea is to add, on the 
module's base, an additional modular layer of polystyrene. One such sub-module will 
correspond to the area occupied by tracks and will be fixed, while others will support 
scenery and will allow dismounting. Up to four versions for such sub-modules should 
be built, having a similar layout but adapted to each of the four seasons. For instance, 
a forest area sub-module will have four versions containing trees with spring, 
summer, autumn (and without) leaves; trees should be placed on sub-modules using a 
consistent layout, to make them look-alike. The sub-modules will be interchanged 
each three months. 
Note: the costs for having this functionality implemented are low, if diorama 
modules are designed accordingly, while the impact on realism is significant (it may 
be considered a wow-feature). 
Step IV. The following criteria (and their ranks) are considered in this case study: 
uniqueness (4.8), attractiveness (9.2), wow-feature (5.1), difficulty (7.7), triggers 
desire for other functionalities (9.5), hard-to-be-copied (4.0), implementation cost 
(4.5). 

 
Managing Emotional Aspects of PSS Functionalities for Sustainability 
173 
Step V. The extended functionalities are ranked according to the criteria from step 
IV; only results for the “thematic scenery modeller” persona are presented here. To 
analyse them against the “triggers desire for other functionalities” criterion, a matrix 
was used (see Table 2; for brevity reasons, only partial results are presented): each 
cell contains the degree in which the functionality on the line triggers the functionality 
on the column (a Saaty scale [0, 1, 3, 9, 27] was used). Table 3 contains an excerpt of 
the ranked functionalities (with respect to all criteria). 
In Table 2, results are calculated by summing up values on lines and normalising 
them afterwards. To calculate results in Table 3, values on columns are multiplied 
with the criteria rank and then summed; the result is multiplied with the emotional 
impact value (estimated on a scale from 0.1 to 0.9, in the context of the “thematic 
scenery modeller” persona).  
Step VI. In the context of a specific persona, the functionality list is revised 
(extended) for each target function, according to information from step V. Using the 
approach in [23], a global PSS solution (functional perspective) is built for each 
persona.

For the “thematic scenery modeller”, the final PSS concept is built around the idea 
of lending high-end diorama modules and selling customized rolling stock. The 
diorama control should be completely automated and controllable over the internet, to 
allow functionalities such as remotely programming new routes.

Conclusions, Limitations, Future Work 
No “direct” or “correct” route towards business sustainability can be determined. 
However, sustainability can be attained through long-term competitiveness; especially 
in niche and creative industries, this implies a thorough knowledge of one's domain, 
customer needs, skills and – most important – the emotional impact of provided 
functionalities.  
PSSs are great competitiveness supports for businesses acting in creative domains. 
The approach introduced in this paper adds robustness to this support in terms of 
shaping PSS functionalities that make customers loyal in a constructive and creative 
way, and are difficult to be copied. Also, customers are supported to achieve more 
fulfilling results within the domain, with a positive impact on the PSS provider's 
business. To sum up, this means investments made today for future results, i.e. 
sustainability.  
The above approach aims to increase the effectiveness of PSS design. 
Nevertheless, it has also limitations. Business in such domains is usually small, and 
the skills of competitive engineering, required by the methodology, need to be 
developed. Moreover, the results (in terms of benefits) of such a methodology are 
difficult to be measured, thus proving its effectiveness is not straightforward. 
Future research, related to this approach, will be conducted in two respects: (a) a 
mean to measure the costs and benefits of the PSS developed for the community 
persona, and (b) a more detailed analysis of the mechanism of triggering customer 
desires for specific functionalities.

Abstract. This paper presents a generic model for evaluating the economic and 
environmental impacts of product service lifetime, which is important and use-
ful in the design and management of PSS. From a PSS provider’s perspective, 
the presented model conducts life-cycle costing (LCC) and life-cycle assess-
ment (LCA) simultaneously and quantifies the total life-cycle cost and envi-
ronmental impact associated with the product lifetime. The entire life cycle of 
the product is considered, including its manufacturing (or purchase), usage, 
maintenance, and end-of-life treatment. Applied with a sensitivity analysis of 
varying product lifetime, the model can identify the optimal service lifetime at 
which the life-cycle cost and environmental impact can be minimized. To illu-
strate, the developed model is applied to the example of a piece of currently-
marketed agricultural machinery.  
Keywords: Product life cycle, life-cycle costing (LCC), life-cycle assessment 
(LCA), product lifetime planning, optimal equipment replacement.

Introduction 
As awareness and concern for environmental issues increase, business and govern-
ment are faced with the key challenge of determining how best to promote and  
facilitate sustainable production and consumption. Products must be designed and 
manufactured carefully so that the entire lifecycle of a product (i.e., manufacturing, 
usage, maintenance, and end-of-life treatment) satisfies customers’ needs while mi-
nimizing adverse environmental impacts. Product service system (PSS) can be a 
promising solution to this challenge. By selling functions instead of physical products, 
a PSS can satisfy customers’ needs while reducing adverse environmental impacts 
[1].  
This paper highlights the importance of a product’s lifetime (i.e., the length of ser-
vice) in the design and management of PSS. From a PSS provider’s perspective, 
product service lifetime (hereinafter referred to as product lifetime) is an important 
factor that influences the total cost and environmental performance of their business.

To maximize the economic and environmental sustainability of a PSS, it is critical to 
understand the impact of product lifetime. This paper presents a generic model that 
can be used to evaluate product lifetime. Life-cycle costing (LCC) and life-cycle as-
sessment (LCA) are conducted simultaneously to evaluate the economic and envi-
ronmental consequences of product lifetime. To illustrate, the developed model is 
applied to an example of currently-marketed agricultural machinery.   
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe the 
models for life-cycle costing and life-cycle assessment, respectively. Section 4 
presents an illustrative case study with the example of an agricultural machine. Sec-
tion 5 provides a summary of the study and concludes the paper.

Life-Cycle Costing 
2.1 
Overview 
Life-cycle costing (LCC) is a technique for calculating the total costs related to a 
product and its entire life cycle. The life cycle of a product can be divided into four 
stages, i.e., manufacturing (or purchase), usage, maintenance, and end-of-life treat-
ment. This section presents an LCC approach to calculating costs associated with the 
four life-cycle stages. The approach also incorporates costs for taxes, insurance and 
storage. Equation (1) provides the total life-cycle cost, Ctotal, under consideration:

where Cmfg, Cusage, Cmaint, and Ceol denote the costs of manufacturing, usage, mainten-
ance, and end-of-life treatment, respectively, Ctis denotes the costs for property taxes, 
insurance, and storage (TIS), and Cit denotes the income tax effects.  
The cost models in this paper provide the total and per-hour costs of product life 
cycle, given a specific product lifetime, TY (in years). Time value of money is consi-
dered in all models. More specifically, the models first calculate present equivalent of 
the total cost, and convert it into a series of equivalent uniform annual costs occurring 
at the end of each year for TY years. The capital recovery factor 
(
)
/[1
1
]
TY
i
i

is 
used for the computation [2]. (See Equation (2) for example.) The resulting annual 
cost is then divided by the annual hours of product usage, AH (in hours), to obtain the 
hourly cost of the product (e.g., Equation (3)). In this paper, annual compounding 
with the real interest i% is applied, and the year-end occurrence is assumed for all 
costs—all cash flows associated with the year occur at the end of the year.  
2.2 
Manufacturing (Purchase) 
The cost occurring at this stage is the manufacturing cost or the purchase expense. 
Suppose that the total cost at this stage is Cmfg. Since the product is acquired at time 
zero, there is no need to consider time value.

Equation (2) finds the uniform annual cost, ACmfg, occurring at the end of each year 
that would be equivalent to the present cost Cmfg. Finally, Equation (3) gives the hour-
ly cost of manufacturing, HCmfg, by dividing ACmfg by AH.

Usage 
Product usage generally involves the costs of energy consumption, such as cost of 
fuel, gas, or electricity. Suppose that a product consumes fuel for its operation, and 
the average fuel consumption rate (i.e., the amount of fuel consumed for an hour of 
operation) is estimated as FR (in kg fuel/hour). Equation (4) then calculates the per-
hour cost of usage by multiplying FR by the unit price of fuel (i.e., cfuel). It is also 
possible to compute the total usage cost, Cusage (in present value), as shown in Equa-
tion (5). First, the uniform annual cost, ACusage, is obtained by multiplying HCusage by 
the annual hours of product usage, AH. For each annual cost, its present equivalent is 
obtained considering the timing of its occurrence, and all the resulting present equiva-
lents are summed up to the total usage cost, Cusage.

Maintenance 
Maintenance activities, i.e., the replacement of parts and lubricants, are another factor 
that affects the life-cycle cost of a product. To capture the cost of maintenance, one 
should know the number of replacements during the life cycle, the unit cost of each 
replacement, and the timing of cash flow for each replacement.   
Equation (6) computes the total number of replacements of part k during TY years, 
i.e., RNk, where λk denotes the replacement cycle of part k (in hours), and TH refers to 
the total product lifetime (in hours), i.e., total accumulated hours of usage during TY 
years. In Equation (6), the first replacement cycle is subtracted from TH, since the 
first part is included in a new machine and does not constitute a replacement.

Equation (7) computes Cmaint, the present equivalent of the total maintenance cost. 
Here, μk denotes the number of units of part k in the product, and 
maint
ke
denotes the 
per-unit cost (or purchase price) of replacement part k. Since all cash flows occur at 
the end of years, it must be identified for each replacement when it happens, in other 
words, what year the cost should be assigned to. The exponent using ceiling function 
is developed for this purpose. Similar to Equations (2) and (3), the total cost of main-
tenance can be converted into its equivalent costs per year and per hour. The same 
capital recovery factor and AH are used for the calculation. 
2.5 
End-of-Life Treatment 
The end-of-life phase involves activities such as third-party resale, recycling and dis-
posal. It incorporates processing of the used product and all the waste from its main-
tenance (i.e., replaced part k). The product is sold for the salvage value of

of end-of-life treatment in its present equivalent. The total cost of end-of-life treat-
ment can be converted into its equivalent costs per year and per hour, using the capital 
recovery factor.

Property Tax, Insurance, and Storage 
Taxes (property taxes, not income taxes), insurance, and storage (TIS) are another 
cost component due to product ownership. This paper assumes that this cost of TIS is 
paid at the end of each and every year, and that it equals to a fixed rate (i.e., α) of the 
market value of a product, mvN, that may depreciate over time [3].

The value of product depreciates over time. The depreciation can be regarded as ex-
pense, which in turn reduces the income taxes. Equation (10) quantifies the total tax 
saving from product depreciation. The total saving has negative value since it reduces 
costs. The effective income tax rate is given as γ. The annual tax in year N is deter-
mined by the depreciation rate of the year, βN. The depreciation rates are defined by 
the tax law, and the sum of all depreciation rates over time reaches up to one; they are 
unconnected to the depreciation of market value.  
Equation (11) computes the total tax deductions over the lifetime. The expenses at 
the usage and maintenance stages are assumed tax deductible [5]. Since time value 
was already considered in Cusage and Cmaint, there is no need to discount the value.

Life-Cycle Assessment 
3.1 
Overview 
Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is an essential tool for achieving design for life cycle. 
LCA evaluates the potential environmental impact associated with a system (i.e., a 
product, a service, or a PSS), considering its entire life cycle. As shown in many  
previous studies (e.g., [6, 7]), an effective LCA can demonstrate how much environ-
mental impact is caused by a system and how different life-cycle phases and/or sub-
systems contribute to the total impact. The results of the LCA help identify priority 
areas for improvement and ways to reduce environmental impacts.

Equation (13) computes the total life-cycle impact of a product, Itotal. Here, Imfg, Iusage, 
Imaint, and Ieol denote the impacts of manufacturing, usage, maintenance, and end-of-
life treatment, respectively. It should be noted that the environmental impacts has no 
time value, unlike the life-cycle costs in Section 2. In the remainder of the section, it 
is discussed how to assess the impact of each life-cycle stage. Given specific product 
lifetime TY, the models calculate the total environmental impact; the hourly impact is 
then obtained by dividing the total impact by TH (= AH·TY).

Manufacturing 
The impact of manufacturing is determined by the design of a product. More precise-
ly, it is defined by the material composition and manufacturing processes of the prod-
uct. Transportation is also included. The mass, travel distance, and transportation 
mode (e.g., truck, oceanic freight shipping) determine the impact of transportation.

Usage 
The impact of usage can be divided into the impact of energy consumption and the 
impact of emissions. For the product using fuel for its operation, the former includes 
the impacts from producing and delivering fuel. The latter focuses on the emissions 
from diesel fuel combustion, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM).  
Equation (15) formulates the environmental impact of fuel consumption, Ifuel. In the 
equation, efuel, FR, and TH denote the unit impact of fuel (i.e., impact per kg fuel), the 
average fuel consumption rate (in kg/hr), and the total product lifetime in hours, re-
spectively. Equation (16) formulates the impact of emissions, where 
emission
le
 and 
l
ER denote the unit environmental impact (impact per kg of emission) and the average 
emission rate (in kg/hr) of emission j, respectively.

units of part k in the product, RNk denotes the total number of replacements of part k 
over the lifetime TH, and λk denotes the replacement cycle of part k in hours. Again, 
the first replacement cycle is subtracted from TH, since the impact of the first re-
placement was already counted at the manufacturing stage.

ing the product to the third-party. The unit impact of used part k includes both the

Illustrative Case Study: Agricultural Machinery 
4.1 
Background  
To illustrate the developed model, a case study of an agricultural harvester is  
presented in this section. The target machine is characterized by a complex product 
structure with a large number of constituent parts, and it has high fuel consumption 
throughout its long lifetime. Throughout its lifetime, the machine is assumed to be 
used following a constant usage pattern: 400 hours of operation per year (i.e., AH = 
400) with 75% of the time spent for actual production (25% idling). 
Suppose there is a company planning a PSS business with the target machine. The 
company aims to find the optimal machine lifetime TY* (in years) whereby the total 
life-cycle cost and environmental impact of the machine would be minimized. In this 
study, 9% real interest rate was assumed based on the company’s after-tax weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) [2]. Regarding the income tax, the effective tax rate 
was assumed to be 25%. The trend of book values is assumed following the 7-year 
MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System) depreciation rule; for the 
first seven years, the depreciation rates are 10.71, 19.13, 15.03, 12.25, 12.25, 12.25, 
12.25, and 6.13%, respectively [5]. Afterwards, the depreciation rates are zero. Figure 
1 shows the depreciation trend of the target machine.  
In this case study, global warming potential (GWP) was used as the measure of en-
vironmental impact, even though the model generally is applicable with any other 
impact metrics as well, such as an Eco-Indicator 99 score. LCA software SimaPro 7.3 
and life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method IPCC 2007 were used for the impact 
assessment. IPCC 2007 quantifies the GWP of product life cycle considering green-
house gas emissions for a fixed time period (in this study, 100 years). The unit of 
GWP is kg CO2 equivalent (kg CO2e).

Purchase and TIS. The weight of the target machine is approximately 23,000 kg, and 
more than 16,000 parts are used in its manufacturing. The machine consists mostly of 
steel and cast iron (approximately 90%). Rubber and plastics are the second and third 
prevalent materials. The price and environmental impact (impact of manufacturing 
only) of a new machine were assumed to be $350,000 and 83,000 kg CO2e. The mar-
ket value depreciates over time, and the cost of TIS (i.e., property tax, insurance, and 
storage costs) also decreases accordingly. In this study, the depreciation model from 
Ref. [3] was adopted for the market value estimation. The model estimates the market 
value trend of a machine by considering its age and the annual hours of usage. It gives 
the market value at the end of each year. Figure 2 shows the market value trend

assumed for the target machine. Finally, the TIS rate was assumed to be 2% in total 
(i.e., α = 0.02).  
Maintenance. The type and frequency of maintenance activities were assumed based 
on the average maintenance schedule recommended by the equipment’s manufacturer. 
Table 1 shows some of the assumptions relative to the replacement of major parts. It 
was assumed that the first major rebuilding will occur at 3,000 hours (in year 8) and 
that the engine will be replaced at 5,000 hours (in year 13). Minor parts, oil, filters, 
and fluids also were replaced following its own maintenance schedule. The costs per 
replacement were assumed based on the manufacturer’s parts catalog.  
For simplicity, this study assumed that the major repairs and overhauls do not af-
fect the book value or the market value of the machine. However, if they require ad-
justments of the values, a more sophisticated approach may need to be applied in 
assuming value depreciation in Figure 2 [4].  
Usage. The use phase of the target machine involves two impact sources: diesel fuel 
consumption and emissions. Table 2 shows the fuel consumption (in kg/hr) and emis-
sion rates (in g/hr) assumed for the target machine. The density and cost of diesel fuel 
were assumed as 0.855 kg/liter and $1.08/kg (= $3.5/gallon), respectively.  
End-of-Life Treatment. At the end-of-life stage, the machine is sold to a third-party. 
The salvage value was assumed to be identical with the market value of the machine. 
Zero environmental impact was assigned in case of the third-party resale. 
All waste from maintenance is either recycled or discarded. In terms of weight, 
90% of steel and iron is recycled while the rest 10% is discarded by landfill. The other 
materials are discarded either by landfill (80%) or incineration (20%). The processing 
cost was assumed as $40 per metric ton. For allocation of environmental impact, the 
“cut-off approach” was applied. In other words, the environmental impacts or benefits 
from recycling were not allocated to the current life cycle [8, 9].

Evaluation Result: Implications of Product Service Lifetime 
The stacked column charts in Figures 2 and 3 present the results of life-cycle costing 
and life-cycle assessment, respectively. Per-hour values are illustrated for various 
lengths of product lifetime from 1 to 20 years.  
Life-Cycle Cost. Figure 2 shows the per-hour cost of product life cycle with different 
lengths of service lifetime. Each stacked column shows how the eight cost compo-
nents (i.e., four life-cycle stages, TIS, and income tax effects) contribute to the total 
cost for the given product lifetime. A negative value indicates that the cost component 
saves taxes or recovers some costs (e.g., end-of-life stage recovers the purchase ex-
pense of the machine).  
Figure 2 shows how the per-hour life-cycle cost would change with the lifetime of 
the machine, TY. Basically, the per-hour cost in the black line shows a decreasing 
trend with the age of the machine. This is due mainly to the reduced cost of manufac-
turing; the more years a machine is used, the more hours there are to spread the cost 

186

of manufacturing over. However, as the lifetime increases more, the benefit of longer 
lifetime is sometimes offset by the increasing cost of maintenance. Although main-
tenance expenses accompany some income tax savings, they become one of the most 
expensive components with the age of the machine. Especially, the major rebuilding 
and parts replacements create significant rise in the total cost, especially in year 8, 
year 13, and year 16.

A trade-off also exists between the costs of end-of-life stage and TIS. Since the 
market value of the machine depreciates with machine age, the longer lifetime implies 
the less salvage value at the end of life stage. However, the depreciation can help save 
TIS (and sometimes income taxes, as well).  
Life-Cycle Impact. Figure 3 shows the results of the environmental impact assess-
ment with various years of machine lifetime. All impacts are for an hour of operation. 
Each column in the figure shows the amount and contribution of the global warming 
potential impact associated with different life-cycle phases. The overall trend of the 
per-hour impact is similar to that of per-hour cost. The per-hour impact shows a de-
creasing trend with the age of the machine due to the reduced impact of manufactur-
ing. However, the major rebuilding and parts replacements sometimes cause some 
increases in the per-hour impact.  
Implication of Product Lifetime. One major difference to note for Figure 3 is that, 
the usage stage is the main contributor for the total environmental impact, and the 
maintenance stage is less emphasized. Accordingly, the influence of maintenance is 
not much significant in Figure 3. Such difference leads to different consequences for 
the same product lifetime. Figure 4(a) compares the trends of per-hour cost and per-
hour impact for the same range of product lifetime from 1 to 20 years. When TY = 8, 
13, and 16 – the years of machine rebuilding and major parts replacement, both the

Discussion 
To minimize costs and environmental impacts associated with a PSS, it is important 
to carefully set the product lifetime. Understanding the economic and environmental 
impacts of product lifetime is critical in this regard. This paper presents a generic 
model that can be used to evaluate the service lifetime of a product.   
The model consists of two parts, i.e., life-cycle costing (LCC) and life-cycle as-
sessment (LCA), which simultaneously evaluate the economic and environmental 
impacts of product service lifetime. The model considers the entire life cycle of a 
product, including its manufacturing (or purchase), usage, maintenance, and end-of-
life treatment. Important economic factors, such as time value of money, taxes, and 
value depreciation, were also taken into account. Applied with a sensitivity analysis 
of varying product lifetime, the model can identify the service lifetime at which the 
life-cycle cost and environmental impact can be minimized. The developed model 
was demonstrated with a currently-marketed agricultural harvester.  
In the future, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to clarify how various parame-
ters and variables affect the economic and environmental impacts of product lifetime. 
Optimal product lifetime is also affected by improvement in the performance of new 
products [10]. In future research, the current model, which only considers a single 
product, should be extended to a more sophisticated model that could consider mul-
tiple generations of products with significant technological changes.

Abstract. From the viewpoint of sustainability development, the living standard 
could be increased by the economic development without worsening resource 
shortage and environmental stresses. As an innovative business model, Product-
Service Systems (PSS) give the chance to satisfy the sustainability of consump-
tion and production, but PSS are not automatic sustainable by itself. Increasing 
the resource efficiency is the goal and also the means of realizing sustainable 
development. Therefore, resource efficiency is becoming one of the key indica-
tors of the sustainability development. In the areas of human living, city  
mobility brings the convenience and comfort, and also the problems of energy 
shortage and environmental/social negative impacts. This paper presents two 
case studies of PSS-oriented city mobility systems, i.e. sustainable e-Bike rent-
ing and e-Car sharing. The relevant products and services are designed syste-
matically with the consideration of increasing the resource efficiency along the 
whole PSS-lifecycle.

Introduction 
Sustainable development is defined as the development that meets the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs in the year of 1987 by UN [1]. From this definition, the emphasis of sustainabil-
ity development lies on the continuous satisfaction of the human needs which are 
realized and satisfied by using natural resources. In case of improving their ability to 
meet their primary needs like food, clothes, living and mobility by own competence 
and initiative while complying with sustainability standards, good opportunities to 
essentially balance the uneven global distribution of wealth can be tapped. Production 
technologies in the broadest sense determine the relation between benefit and the 
required use of resources [2]. For this purpose new production processes and prod-
ucts, a decreasing intensity of resource consumption and a closed loop economy are 
required [3].

Urban transport is one of the important sections in human living environment. Ur-
ban transport has various modes in the urban area and can be roughly classified as 
road transport, rail transport, water transport and cable transport. In this paper, city 
mobility is defined as the means of road transport in urban areas i.e. car, bus, motor-
cycle and bike. According to the three dimensions of sustainable development (eco-
nomic, social and ecological aspects), city mobility presents both of challenges and 
opportunities from the viewpoint of sustainability development. In the economic as-
pect, various kinds of mobility enable the production and trade in urban and rural 
areas by supporting the goods transportation. In the social aspect, people use the mo-
bility to reach their desired places and join the social events. In the ecological aspect, 
mobility causes the problems of resource shortage and environmental pollution. 
Since last decades, the politics and society have pushed the companies to take the 
responsibilities of environment protection and resource reservation. Besides facing to 
the social pressures, the companies also have to confront to the problems of resources 
such as shortage and increasing price of raw material, energy and water. Those exter-
nal and internal threats force the companies to shift their traditional business in a sus-
tainable way. There is a tendency towards combined offers of products and services, 
which are sold together to fulfill customer demands. These combinations of products 
and services are called Product-Service Systems (PSS) [4]. According to its goal 
groups, the PSS business model can be divided as B2B market and B2C market. Es-
pecially, PSS in B2B market is defined as Industrial PSS (IPS²). PSS give the chance 
to satisfy the sustainability of consumption and production. PSS are trying to satisfy 
all the three dimensions of sustainability simultaneously along the lifecycle of PSS.  
In recent years, amount of PSS business models are developed in the field of city 
mobility which are facing to the individual customers more than the industry or  
company. These PSS-based city mobility systems provide the practical examples for 
implementing and developing the IPS² in a sustainable way. In this paper, two case 
studies are presented to design a sustainable PSS business models in city mobility 
with the consideration of lifecycle resource efficiency.

Product-Service Systems for City Mobility 
2.1 
Sustainability of City Mobility 
Due to the growing urbanization, the needs of speed, comfort and safety in city mobil-
ity are becoming more and more important. By 2030, 60% of the population will live 
in a city as predicted by [5]. An increasing human population expands the demands on 
city infrastructures for transport. Meanwhile, the problems related to urban transport 
that have interrelated impacts on the environment, the economy and society, are al-
ways getting bigger as the cities are growing in size and population. On one hand, city 
mobility has indeed changed the mode of human life and increased the quality of life; 
on the other hand, the existing city mobility is facing to the challenges from the view-
point of sustainability development. For example, cars enable a free individual life-
style but can be possessed only by few people due to the limited road capacity and

high expenditure. Public transports like buses provide a more environmental transport 
mode but less flexibility. Motorcycles have been the primary transport mode in many 
developing countries, e.g. in Southeast Asia, but motorcycles are by their nature far 
less crashworthy than closed vehicles [6]. Besides the dangerousness, motorcycles 
lead to the inefficient traffic due to its disordering on road. Comparing with the above 
motorized city mobility modes, bikes can be regarded as a kind of green mobility, but 
its advantages always depend on the condition of weather, infrastructure, topography 
and the intended distance. 
As Fig. 1 shows, the challenges of city mobility are related to many issues within 
sustainability and its three dimensions. The utility of city mobility strongly depends 
on the transport infrastructure. The governments are responsible for the investment in 
roads and the affiliated facilities. In developed countries like in Western Europe, car 
as a public transportation are still the most effective way to travel. In developing 
countries, cars are not easy to access due to the high expenditure and also the weak 
infrastructure. Meanwhile, an efficient city mobility system helps the economic and 
social activities. City mobility is also influenced by the increasing price of fuel and 
other costs in the long-term. Therefore, city mobility has a close connection with 
economy. These motorized transport means are the notable cause of social problems 
such as noise, air pollution and traffic congestion. Cars and other light duty vehicles 
are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, producing around 15% of the EU's

emissions of CO2 [7]. Actually, some of the problems could be stated in different 
dimensions, for example, the traffic congestion can be regarded as a social problem 
and also an economic problem due to the wasted time and energy. The vehicle ex-
haust during the congestion causes a significant impact to the environment. 
2.2 
PSS Business Models for City Mobility 
In recent years, amount of PSS-based business models are introduced into the field of 
city mobility. Due to their common characteristic that transfers the functionality with-
out shifting the ownership of product, these business models can be regarded as 
use/function-oriented PSS. For example, since 2002 German Railway (Deutsche 
Bahn) provides a service, so called “Call a Bike” [8], which can rent the bike to cus-
tomers automatically through the hotline supported locking system. Furthermore, 
similar services have occurred on automobile due to its higher speed and better acces-
sibility of long distance, for example, Car2go [9] and DriveNow [10]. The most con-
tributions of such PSS in city mobility lie in resource saving. 
According to the existing examples of PSS business models around the world that 
introduced in [11], the contributions on sustainability by PSS are:  
• Ecology: saving resources by more intangible service, improving recycling  
activities,  
• Society: increasing users’ satisfaction by high quality service and product, creating 
new job opportunity in service section, provide access to modern technology,  
• Economy: creating new business field and keep competitiveness of company moti-
vated by market.  
In other words, PSS are born under the needs of sustainability development. As an 
innovative business model, PSS are placed high hopes on improving the sustainabili-
ty. But PSS are not automatically sustainable [12]. In the reference of [13], 14 sorts of 
barriers of PSS are concluded and analyzed. Companies are facing such risks and 
uncertainties which could obstruct the implementing the PSS. Those potential prob-
lems also weaken the enthusiasm of PSS providers and customers, who would  
confront with many difficulties during the implementation of PSS, for example, unde-
fined responsibility, unprotected privacy and technical problems. In the industrial 
PSS, the use of technology is limited due to the shortage of qualification. Especially 
in developing countries the qualification level of worker and technicians is not com-
parable to the one in the developed world. Actually, the developing or emerging coun-
tries provide a huge market for implementing PSS with the help of low cost human 
resources. In order to ensure the products are usable and reliable, as promised in the 
contract, the PSS provider has to qualify the local worker and technician from the 
customer or contractors and supervise their work from distance.  
To increase the sustainability of such business models for city mobility, PSS are 
still facing many challenges of sustainability. A sustainable PSS is not only environ-
mentally reasonable but also a chance for making profits. The PSS providers need to 
earn profits based on their businesses. The other conventional companies should be 
encouraged by the benefits and profits from the innovative business model. Therefore, 

 
Case Studies of Sustainable PSS Business Models for City Mobility

the profit model of a PSS needs to be strengthened and presented for the potential PSS 
providers. This point might be connected with another question: why have PSS not 
been widely implemented yet? The recognition between PSS providers and customers 
is one of the most crucial barriers in the implementation of PSS. For example, selling 
functionality or result instead of selling products alone is advantageous once addition-
al costs for information processing and logistics are less than costs for underutilized 
capacity. But from the viewpoint of customers, they might only recognize that they 
should pay more for enjoying the combination of product and service but ignore the 
benefits from the new business model. 
Besides the aspect of business, the resource efficiency is a challenge to PSS while 
the existing PSS models usually ignore the resource efficiency by providing the PSS. 
So called Jevons Paradox (also known as rebound effect) shows the dilemma between 
the technological progress with increased efficiency and the rebounded consumption 
of resource [14]. In some PSS business models like renting or sharing a vehicle, the 
original intension is to reduce production and save resource. But in fact, the customers 
might enjoy the easy access of automobile regardless of the energy saving or product 
maintaining. The problems occur usually in the availability-/results-oriented PSS, 
because the ownership of products will be never shifted to the end customers, and due 
to the weak public awareness related to sustainability, the providers should pay for the 
economic and environmental losses that caused by inefficient consumption of  
customers.

Resource Efficiency in Product-Service Systems 
3.1 
PSS Lifecycle and Resource 
According to life cycle thinking, the resource use for products and services in PSS 
should be considered, because the impacts of products and services should be ana-
lyzed from cradle to grave, i.e. from resource extraction to final waste disposal [15]. 
Aurich and Schweitzer presented the concept of Lifecycle management of IPS² [16] 
and further continuous improvement process [17] of it. Thinking of the product life-
cycle alone, there are many phases included, e.g. material extraction, design, produc-
tion, delivery, use, recycling and disposal. Service lifecycle was presented by Torney 
et al. [18] and Meiren et al. [19]. The lifecycle of service includes idea finding,  
requirement analysis, service design, service implementation, evaluation, and dis-
placement. As a system, PSS should always coordinate both of product and service 
sections. Some new phases are required between them such as PSS configuration. 
Referred to the existing product lifecycle, the PSS-lifecycle is generally divided into 
five phases, e.g. organizational implementation, PSS-planning, PSS-design, PSS-
configuration and PSS-realization. The PSS-lifecycle is shown in two directions, i.e. 
one from manufacturer point of view, and the other from customer point of view as 
Fig. 2 shows. The difficulty is to systematically integrate the service section together 
with the product lifecycle.

Fig. 2. Lifecycle of Product-Service Systems 
As mentioned before, the aim of sustainability development is defined as to satisfy 
the needs in the future. From Maslow’s theory, the needs of human-being could be 
concluded as a hierarchy with five levels such as physiological, safety, love and  
belongingness, esteem and self-actualization [20]. These basic needs are put in the 
bottom of the pyramid-like hierarchy which presents the preconditioning between 
each level. These basic needs of human-being are always realized and satisfied by 
using natural resources, which plays an important role in the sustainability develop-
ment. Normally, the resource is understood as the natural resource which can be 
found within the environment, such as water, air, energy carrier and so on. Specifical-
ly, resource is defined in [21] as market access, innovative products and capital in the 
viewpoint of national economics and focus on the production management which is 
aiming to produce goods optimally with such resources. The resources can be speci-
fied as personnel, equipment, material, time and information. In fact, time and infor-
mation are the intangible resource that must be attached to the production process and 
during the use of information, an upgrading of information leads to knowledge gener-
ation. Personnel are used as the main body of production where their capability to 
operate the equipment to process the material into end products. Therefore, all kinds 
of resources are involved with each other in the different phases of product and  
service lifecycle.  
On one hand, the natural resources provide the necessary raw materials, energy 
carriers and water to support the production and human living, but due to the limita-
tion and increasing demands, resource undersupplying and increasing price is becom-
ing a problem of society, especially industry. On the other hand, during the lifecycle 
of resource, i.e. extraction, usage and disposal, the natural environment has been ex-
ploited by the wrong treatments. People cannot live in this worsening environment. 
Furthermore, resource productivity also determines the competitiveness and profita-
bility of company. Thus, the resource is involved within the three dimensions of sus-
tainability. From the economic and ecological point of view, realizing the sustainable 
development can be partly simplified as a process of increasing the resource efficien-
cy. The resource efficiency determines the sustainability of PSS. Along the lifecycle 
of PSS, different resources will be used in the lifecycle phases of product and service. 
According to the using insensitivity of resource, the product and service can be classi-
fied as different types due to resources-intensive product or service in the lifecycle 
phases.

3.2 
Designing PSS Concerning Resource Efficiency 
Resource efficiency means using the Earth's limited resources in a sustainable manner 
while minimizing impacts on the environment. In other words, resource efficiency 
aims to create more with less and to deliver greater value with less input [22]. Design-
ing a PSS based on the traditional business model, namely selling the product alone, 
new services should be designed and adapted to the existing products. When the PSS 
business runs well, more ideas of new services would appear, and then more require-
ments on products would be requested by those new services. In other words, the 
providers would improve their products and services simultaneously, so that they 
could provide a set of available services with required products or products with suit-
able services continuously. 
Designing a sustainable PSS business model with the consideration of resource ef-
ficiency is the core concept of the paper. An approach is to be designed with efficient 
technology which can shift the resource use into a high efficient way. Resource effi-
ciency could work as the indicator of the designed business model. Therefore, realiz-
ing the sustainability of the PSS could be simplified as increasing the resource effi-
ciency. Resource will be not always used in product lifecycle, but also can be saved 
by technology that plays a key role in sustainable development. As mentioned before, 
the resources are used to realize the product and service lifecycle, in other words, 
tangible product itself should be designed to create more value with less resource. As 
an intangible activity, service contributes as an add-on function beside of product and 
also creates new value by dematerialized way. Thus, the Value-Resource ratio could 
be taken into account to measure resource efficiency. By analyzing the existing prod-
uct and its resource consumption the value of resource input could be generated, e.g. 
water volume or material weight, which used as input reference for the functional 
realization. Hereby, the approach begins with the thoughts of resource consumption 
and value creation, and further provides a new viewpoint for product design with 
consideration of resource consumption.

Case Study 
Research [23] has found that 46% of bikes are used only once or twice a week, with a 
further 30% being used once a fortnight or even less. And cars are used only about 60 
minutes per day. The rest idle tie, all the bike or cars are placing in the parking place 
which causes other social problems. Therefore, the basic idea is renting or sharing the 
idle city mobility for public using. With the analysis of existing PSS business models 
for city mobility, two case studies, i.e. PSS based e-Bike renting and e-Car sharing, 
was designed in a sustainable way. So that three dimensions could be satisfied  
simultaneously.

PSS Business Model for e-Bike Renting 
Based on the existing business model of bike renting systems, the case study of PSS 
based e-Bike renting system is done. Comparing with the conventional city mobility, 
e-Bike has many advantages in viewpoint of sustainability, as Fig. 3 shows. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Advantages of PSS business models for city mobility based on e-Bike 
An e-Bike can maintain a higher average speed than a conventional bike, yet take 
advantage of the same network of cycle facilities, giving access to routes that cars and 
motorcycles cannot reach. The result is a faster door-to-door journey time than any 
other mode. By nipping along the relatively uncongested cycle network, but eliminat-
ing hills and headwinds, electric bikes are often the most consistent mode of travel. 
An e-Bike increases the average speed and enabling the physical disabilities or aged 
people. The easing effect would be getting larger in hilly areas where usually are un-
der developed. The speed of e-Bikes is limited as 25kmh in law, so they require no 
tax, insurance or license. A recent survey of e-Bike owners reveals that a third rides 
their bike at least once a day and 81% use the bike at least once a week [24]. Especial-
ly, e-Bike introduces the renewable energy into the city mobility system and improves 
the sustainability of it in a large scale. So, an innovative business model of bike rent-
ing should to be designed for the sustainable use e-Bike.  
Comparing with the conventional bike, e-Bike has its own characteristic, namely, 
the battery charging. With the battery the bike can be more effective but it takes also 
the problem, not like the petroleum powered mobility which can be tanked in few 
minutes, the bottleneck of e-Bike lies on the duration of battery and the time of bat-
tery charging. Furthermore, the normal e-Bikes are designed with a 3-5 kg embedded 
motors which cannot be removed from the bike, so the bikes are getting troublesome 
due to the weight of battery and motor, when the battery is empty or the customer just 
want to ride on a single bike without electric driving system. 
For these challenges of e-Bike and the business model, the core concept of this de-
velopment is based on a “Service automat”. A service automat is designed with a 
touch screen and spaces which can store the batteries, and also other accessories, so 
called toolkits. Fig. 4 shows the process of renting an e-Bike which can be divided 
into three sections, i.e. registration and renting, riding and probably upgrading, and 
return.

Fig. 4. Concept diagram of e-Bike renting system 
A serial of “plug-play style” toolkits are developed under the principle of quick-
fix, so that the customers can install the toolkits within minute-scale period. The  
problem of battery charging can be solved by the approach of changing the backup 
batteries which are stored in the service automat. And some other value-added servic-
es are provided based on these toolkits. Customers find one of the service automats in 
the city and withdraw the toolkits according to their needs. With a simple installation 
instruction, service will be enabled and charged by renting time. A motor kit is de-
signed to improve the flexibility of e-Bike. The motor kit presents a new approach for 
the electric motorization. In comparison with the existing e-Bike with embedded  
irremovable motor, the motor kit drives the bike in external way and can be easily 
installed or removed from the bike in few minutes. The removable motor kit improves 
the flexibility of the bike.  
To enable the PSS based e-Bike renting and service providing, lots of information 
and communication technologies (ICT) have been implemented. Besides the toolkits 
in service automat, the ICT powered interaction platform enables the information 
service during the whole renting process. The smart phone works as a portable  
computer for data acquirement and data transition. A smart phone application was 
developed to collect the information from condition sensors, GPS receiver and RFID 
reader. Based on the real-time information, the application provides more service-like 
functions, for example, Location-based Service guides the customers to their wished 
goals; Condition-based Monitoring enables the remote supervision of the bike; Data 
analyzing provides the transport advising.

Fig. 5. ICT powered interaction platform on e-Bike 
As Fig. 5 shows, an interaction platform is developed on the smart phone. Custom-
ers can download the application to their own smart phone by swiping the Near-Field-
Communication tag or scanning the bar code or QR-code. Using the interaction  
platform, customers can get the service information, such as battery status and pre-
dicted distance, condition parameters of the e-Bike, location based services and the 
nearest service automat. To interact with the PSS provider, customer can call or send 
message to the information center to access more services. In the final step of e-Bike 
renting, customer need to report the probable damage and pay the charge through user  
account. 
4.2 
PSS Business Model for e-Car Sharing 
In comparison with the e-Bike renting, the second case study e-Car sharing lays the 
emphasis on PSS based sharing system. As mentioned before, cars are still the most 
freedom mode in the city mobility, but facing the requirements of sustainability, rele-
vant problems in social, economic and ecological dimensions should be solved. With 
the development of battery technology, e-Car is becoming the most feasible transport 
means with low carbon emission and no air pollution. To support the implementation 
of e-Car, many charging networks have been built in cities worldwide, but similar to 
the conventional cars, the e-Car has also the problem of low resource efficiency 
which increases the investment of car and makes large parking place occupied. Thus, 
the general thinking of the case study is share the cars, namely let more people who 
are in need of the car be able to access it in the idle time.  
The business models include two kinds of owners. One is the car renting compa-
nies which own a number of cars or e-Cars in the city. And the other is the private 
sharers who want to share the car for the sharing system. The owners of cars can 
submit the information of car location and available time to the sharing platform. 
Customers are able to find the available cars by the web-based platform. After posi-
tioning the suitable car, customers can get the car with the member card.  

 
Case Studies of Sustainable PSS Business Models for City Mobility 
201 
 
The resource efficiency for maintenance of car can be regarded as the most impor-
tant point in the e-Car sharing system. Due to the separated ownership, the customers 
tend to use the shared car in an irrational way. In order to divide the responsibility of 
probable damages on car, the condition of the cars should be monitored by using on-
board measurement which is pre-installed on the cars with several sensors to record 
the condition parameters and GPS information. The PSS-providers, e.g. car sharing 
platform takes the charge of supervision and other legal issues according to the agreed 
general business terms.  
 
Fig. 6. e-Car sharing and the data flow 
 
As Figure 6 shows, the data flow of condition based monitoring between all the ob-
jects in the car sharing system. Condition based monitoring enables the efficient 
maintenance activity and avoids the dispute due to car damage. Without that, the PSS 
business model could not be implemented in a profitable way, although the e-Car 
sharing concept has satisfied the requirements of sustainability in ecological and  
social dimension.

Conclusion 
City mobility inclusive cars, buses, motorcycles and bikes which provide the custom-
ers convenient transport mode in urban areas. With the development of urbanization 
and world population, city mobility is facing to the challenges from requirements of 
sustainability development, and several problems need to be changed. Product-
Service Systems as an innovative business model provides a change for the sustaina-
ble city mobility system. In this paper the resource efficiency of PSS lifecycle has 
been regarded as the key to improve the sustainability of city mobility. Two case  
studies about designing sustainable PSS business model for city mobility have been 
presented with the consideration of lifecycle resource efficiency. The further research 
would be taken in the work of integrating the resource management for the production 
of PSS-based city mobility system.

Abstract. Eco-efficiency in Product-Service Systems (PSS) is one of today’s 
challenges for achieving sustainability and reducing the environmental burden 
of our production and consumption patterns. However, there are few eco-design 
methods and tools for the development of eco-efficient PSS and some issues are 
still not solved for systematic design of environmentally friendly PSS. This pa-
per aims to show that the ‘design buckle’ object - previously developed in the 
PSS literature - is a concept which can support the system design by enabling 
the generation and comparison of alternative solutions. An environmental as-
sessment can be performed on the buckles and facilitate the design process for 
providing eco-efficient PSS. 
Keywords: Product-Service Systems, eco-efficiency, design, eco-design, envi-
ronmental assessment.

Introduction 
Modern societies have to reduce their consumption of physical resources enormously. 
In this context, Product-Service Systems could be seen as a lever to improve the envi-
ronmental performance by a factor X [1] while providing the same benefits to the 
customer as a traditional product. Mont defined PSS as systems in which, products, 
services, supporting infrastructure and necessary networks, are designed to provide a 
certain quality of life to customers, and at the same time, minimize environmental 
impacts of the system [2]. By focusing on the final user’s satisfaction instead of on 
the product itself, PSS should create new consumption behaviors. Renting, sharing 
and pooling could lead to important environmental gains [3]. Nevertheless, most of 
the authors dealing with these issues emphasize on the importance of carefully de-
signing PSS in a holistic perspective to achieve sustainability [4] and then eco-
efficiency. However, PSS eco-design raises several issues and methods and tools are 
still largely missing in the PSS literature. 
The concept of “design buckles” (DB) has previously been developed by Maus-
sang et al. [5] in a global PSS design methodology. The purpose of this paper is to 
show how the DB concept can facilitate the eco-design of PSS by enhancing the inte-
gration of environmental considerations and the evaluation of alternative solutions at 
the buckle level. Following this introduction, this paper describes in Section 2 the 

204 
L. Trevisan et al. 
issues raised by the design of eco-efficient PSS and details the existing methods at-
tempting to solve these issues. The DB concept is then explained in Section 3 and an 
extension of this concept is proposed to show how it can be helpful in the eco-design 
of PSS. Finally, in Section 4, a case study on a refrigerating system illustrates how the 
buckles can be evaluated to compare solutions and facilitate the eco-design of PSS.

Issues Raised in Designing Eco-efficient PSS 
2.1 
Integration of Products and Services 
Many design methods to develop products and services have been proposed in litera-
ture. In a general manner, major differences exist between Product- and Service-
oriented design methods. Product-oriented design methods mainly focus on the  
technical performance given to the products. Series of “Design for X” methodologies 
exist and aim at attaining specific goals (X) on the products [6]. Products are physical 
units often described by the functions they provide. In Service-oriented design me-
thods, the design object is not a physical artifact but the description of processes and 
activities. Indeed, in a service delivery process, designers have to focus on the cus-
tomer experience, and value is considered as created for the user during an activity 
and based on the performance and outcome of the activity [7].  
However, services are always supported by products [8], which have to be inte-
grated into the description of the system. One of the difficulties raised by the PSS 
design is coupling product- and service-oriented methods focusing on different design 
objects. Aurich et al. [9] emphasize this question for the development of technical 
PSS, noticing that service and product design are often performed separately, result-
ing in a lack of consideration of the mutual influences of products and technical  
services. They argue that these two design processes need to be linked to achieve 
integrated PSS design processes. Without this consideration of the whole system in an 
integrated design process, it seems to be difficult for designers to adopt a holistic 
approach, encompassing the environmental, social and economic considerations, 
which are major challenges for the development of sustainable PSS [4]. 
2.2 
Eco-design Issues 
Eco-design aims to integrate environmental considerations into the design process. 
Bovea and Pérez-Belis [10] proposed a taxonomy of existing eco-design tools, which 
aims to help designers selecting the most appropriate ones according to several crite-
ria. The framework of the taxonomy raises some general observations. First, there is 
no tool which enables the integration of both technical and functional aspects into the 
product requirements in addition to the environmental ones. Secondly, there is no tool 
covering all the design process stages and there are few tools enabling to generate 
design alternatives. This framework represents existing eco-design tools for integrat-
ing environmental requirements into the product design process and does not deal 
with the service aspect. Nevertheless, it makes the lack of global methodology for 

 
Design Buckles to Facilitate Eco-design of Product-Service Systems 
205 
eco-design appear. The major problem raised by eco-design is then to integrate the 
environmental requirements with others in a multi-criteria analysis and to cover all 
the stages of the design process. To solve these issues, some authors have combined 
existing tools. Sakao [11] proposed a method centered on QFD (Quality Function 
Deployment) and coupling Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and TRIZ to design eco-
efficient products. In the PSS design field, the PSSDAE (PSS design and evaluation) 
[12] [13] has been proposed. It is an integrated two-phase approach which combines 
six existing methods and tools supporting the global development process.  
Eco-design of services also raises many difficulties, which have been identified 
and largely discussed in literature. There is a lack of tools for measuring the environ-
mental impacts of services. Indeed, services are often assimilated to the concept of 
dematerialization, where ‘pure services’ are considered as having, in theory, no envi-
ronmental impact.  However, services are always supported by products, which  
impact the environmental burden, just as PSS do [8]. Thus, the evaluation of envi-
ronmental impacts of services is challenging for multiple reasons. For Brezet et al. 
[8], the choice of the system boundaries can be complicated because of the principles 
of environmental assessment. Indeed, measurement of environmental impact is done 
for a new system by comparing with the old one, providing the same functionality. 
However the choice of the functional unit is often not obvious when the system  
impacts consumer behavior and requires a shared infrastructure. Consequently, the 
system boundaries can be blurred. Brezet et al. [8] proposed a method dealing with 
the design of eco-efficient services (DES) by integrating multiple tools and actions to 
follow through during the design process. Beyond the difficulties raised by the service 
notion, LCA can be done retrospectively on PSS cases to evaluate their environmental 
impacts, as shown by Sundin et al. [14]. Nevertheless, in an eco-design perspective, a 
method enabling this evaluation at a detailed level to guide design choices is still 
missing. 
2.3 
Existing Methods and Gaps in Design of Eco-efficient PSS 
Some authors propose PSS eco-design methods aiming at coupling product and ser-
vice design techniques with the objective of providing eco-efficient or sustainable 
solutions. Geum and Park [15] provided a ‘‘product-service blueprint’ representation 
to visualize the use of the product throughout its’ life cycle, the service flow, and the 
relationship between products and services. Sustainability is represented by the “point 
of sustainability achieved” to show how the PSS improve sustainability in the global 
process. Maxwell et al. [16] proposed the Sustainable Product and Service Develop-
ment (SPSD) to guide PSS development. During the concept development, a focus on 
functionality, expressed by a functional need and its life cycle, aims at determining 
the most sustainable way of providing that function (through a product, service or a 
PSS). Lelah et al. [17] proposed a methodology based on LCA and an associated 
model to describe a complex PSS collaborative network and the roles of the involved 
actors. The PSS network is seen as imbrications of successive B2B (Business To 
Business) PSS offers. Sustainability is defined as depending on the organization of 
activities built around physical objects and the aim is to show how these objects are 
used individually or collectively within an actor’s network. 

206 
L. Trevisan et al. 
All these design methods aim at integrating product and service aspects while  
taking into account eco-design issues in order to achieve eco-efficiency in PSS: inte-
grating a life cycle approach, identifying opportunities for decreasing environmental 
impacts, measuring the environmental burden and integrating global support systems 
like the supply chain or the actor’s network. However, if the previous methods can be 
useful at a macro level, the transition towards a detailed design seems to be hard. To 
enable the full integration of the environmental considerations during the entire de-
sign process, it seems necessary to be able to generate convenient scenarios of PSS 
solutions at each step of the design process. The previous methods can be used for the 
design of the global offer. Amaya et al. [18] propose a more detailed method consi-
dering the organization of the system elements (products and services) and the system 
parameters to support the generation of use scenarios aiming at intensify the products 
use in PSS.  
This paper presents a complementary point of view. Noticing that there is no  
method supporting the eco-design of the internal elements of the system, this paper 
proposes to explore the ‘Design Buckle’ (DB) concept to help at a detailed design 
level. The proposed approach can generate scenarios that couple functional aspects 
and possible elements of solutions. “The PSS designer […] needs to constantly move 
from a global vision of the system down to detailed features describing the interac-
tions between the physical and service elements that compose it” [4]. In the next sec-
tion, this paper exposes prior work in this field and exploits the DB concept as an 
artifact that can help designers move from a global to a detailed vision of the system 
and thereby support the design of eco-efficient PSS.

Potential of the Design Buckle Concept to Facilitate PSS  
Eco-design  
3.1 
Design Methodology and Design Buckles 
Maussang et al. [5] developed a PSS engineering design methodology to provide de-
signers with technical specifications for the development of the physical objects in-
volved in the system.  PSS are defined as systems composed of service units and 
physical objects. The physical objects are functional entities and the service units are 
(often technical) entities ensuring the smooth functioning of the system. The elements 
are related to and interact with one another. Their representation facilitates the inte-
gration of the specificities of each element during the design process.  
The methodology begins with an external functional analysis, supported by a graph 
of inter-actors. It represents the system as a ‘black box’ which interacts with custom-
ers and actors involved during the life cycle. The goal is to provide the external func-
tions expected. Then, these functions are characterized by external criteria, defining 
level and allowance, corresponding to the satisfaction of the external requirements. 
The external analysis is followed by an internal analysis of the system, where each 
function is deployed to define the technical functions the PSS has to generate as well 
as potential principles for solutions. To model these principles, the internal structure 
of the system is described using the functional block diagram (FBD) representation 

 
Design Buckles to Facilitate Eco-design of Product-Service Systems 
207 
(see Figure 1). The FBD representation describes different elements. The frontiers 
between the PSS and the outer environment are represented by two horizontal lines. 
The different components of the system appear (products and service units) as well as 
the inter-actors existing in the outer environment of the PSS. The interaction functions 
(IF) correspond to the functions provided by the system to an outer environment dur-
ing its life cycle. The DBs represent an organizational choice, which means that each 
DB ensures a technical function, which is described by a particular scenario. The 
methodology also proposes modeling scenarios by using the structured analysis and 
design techniques (SADT) representation. Use scenarios as well as operational scena-
rios are described to illustrate the interaction between the system and external agents 
(such as the customer or actors involved) but also the activities performed internally 
for the system to operate. Authors argue that the FBD has to be completed by the 
definition of scenarios at the same time as proposing a convenient solution, because 
scenarios link the elements of the solutions that emerge during the deployment of the 
functions.

3.2 
Interest of the Design Buckles for PSS Eco-design 
The methodology previously presented has several advantages when dealing with 
eco-efficiency issues in PSS design. First, the functional and behavioral descriptions 
of the system are produced concurrently. This coupling provides better integration of 
the product- and the service-based approaches. ‘What’ (functions) the system has to 
provide is described as well as ‘how’ (activities) it has to be provided. Secondly, the 
approach proposes FBD representation. Even if it provides only a partial view of the 
whole system, the FBD models the elements of the system as well as their relation-
ships and organization. The choice of the system’s elements and the way they are 
organized to provide the expected function and behavior can be changed to establish 
scenarios of solutions with different environmental impacts. These impacts depend on 
the elements as well as their organization.

L. Trevisan et al. 
The DBs are also an interesting object for the environmentally conscious design of 
PSS. Indeed, although they result from the technical functions and their associated 
operational scenarios, they are determined before the solutions, in order to generate 
alternatives at a design level when the final solution is not yet completely known.  
These intermediary objects seem to be one of the best compromises to generate alter-
natives and to evaluate them. They link the problem space and the solution space, 
keeping in mind design choices and reveal the effects produced by a change in the 
solutions on the other elements of the system.  This intermediary position of the DB 
allows designers to move from a global vision of the system down to detailed features 
of the interrelated elements [4]. This paper argues that it can be a lever in the eco-
design of PSS. Indeed, simultaneously designing all the elements of the system is not 
a reasonable option. The issue in design is to select a convenient part of the system to 
focus on without neglecting the complex interactions with the other parts in order to 
build scenarios for solutions.  The DBs are the objects entering into this choice. Sev-
eral elements of the solution can be involved in different DBs, and DBs are linked to 
the technical functions and to the activities. These links are clearly visible, limiting 
the environmental assessment necessary to a convenient set of functions and solutions 
and facilitating decision-making when the entire system is not yet defined.

Case Study 
4.1 
Presentation of the Case 
This paper now completes the study of the case introduced by Maussang et al. [5] to 
compare and evaluate two scenarios using the design buckles they proposed. The case 
dealt with a high temperature superconducting (HTS) project supervised by the US 
Department of Energy, to transport energy in superconducting cables. A French com-
pany is responsible for providing the refrigeration system of the HTS cables. The 
cables are enveloped and refrigerated with liquid nitrogen (LN2). A refrigerator en-
sures the regulation of the temperature of the LN2 coolant. In the original study, the 
methodology presented in section 3.1 for designing PSS was followed. An external 
analysis provided the functions of the system. Several DBs were identified resulting 
from the function ‘provide to the customer the cable refrigeration’. This paper focuses 
on two of the DBs, which are: ‘to modify the performance of the fridge’ (DB1) and 
‘to repair the equipments’ (DB2). The study proposes two scenarios. In each scenario, 
the operational scenarios and the elements used as solutions are different. 
In the first scenario, a team composed of technicians is ‘on-site’ and can modify 
the fridge performances (see Figure 2). Moreover, this team can also do simple repair 
on the equipment (DB2). The customer contacts the call centre that serves as a go-
between who transmits the needs to the on-site team. However, in cases requiring 
more important repairs, an external expert maintenance team must intervene. 
In the second scenario, calls are centralized by an expert supervision unit, which 
monitors the fridge and controls the equipment via a remote supervision module (see 
Figure 3). In this scenario, the technical function ‘to repair the equipments’ is per-
formed by the supervision unit via the supervision module. However, as in scenario 1,

209 
if serious reparations are needed, an external maintenance unit goes directly to the 
site. For this buckle,the supervision module is able to diagnose failures and transmit 
them to the maintenance unit.

Application of the Methodology 
This paper will now compare these two scenarios by evaluating their environmental 
impacts in the first DB (DB1) and then in the first and second DBs (DB1 + DB2) in 
order to illustrate the use of DBs in PSS eco-design.  
Environmental Indicators. The case focuses on a refrigerating system. From this 
point of view, this paper uses MEErP (Methodology for Ecodesign of Energy-related 
Products) [19], which is particularly well-adapted to this kind of product, that the 
European Commission (EC) identified as ‘Energy-related products’. This methodolo-
gy has been developed by the EC together with an associated tool called ErP Ecore-
port, using a benchmark of cases created by the EC [19]. The tool enables a quick life 
cycle description of a product to obtain the impacts for a selective list of indicators 
(see Table 1). ErP Ecoreport is a simplified tool for analyzing the life cycle impacts. 
In the next section, this paper identifies the main hypothesis adopted for the study.

Study Boundaries and Hypotheses. In order to compare the two scenarios, it is first 
necessary to identify the differences between the scenarios in each DB. Once this is 
done, the ErP Ecoreport can be used to facilitate the environmental assessment of the 
products identified in the DBs. The analysis needs only to focus on the products in-
volved in the DBs and the impacts of the other elements (service units and support 
products) are estimated and included by the tool. In this study, the functional unit can 
be defined by the availability of the fridge (required to be over 99.8%) during 5 years 
(the normal life time of the fridge). To simplify the case study, the impacts caused by 
the different maintenance and call center teams, in both buckles and scenarios, have 
been omitted. They all require infrastructures and other transportation facilities that 
are shared with other services or other clients and so the impacts are hard to estimate 
and somehow can be assumed to compensate one another in this initial simplified

analysis. In DB1, the supervision module is quite similar to the control module, but it 
requires the partial use of a computer and a communication network for remote con-
trol. The energy consumed by the supervision module is higher than by the control 
module, because of the remote monitoring and the failure detection. The fridge is the 
major element involved in BD2 because its availability depends on maintenance. In 
the first scenario the fridge is repaired on-site by the customer’s maintenance team but 
less efficiently than in the second scenario, where the supervision module provides 
more information to an expert team. This means that repairing the fridge is easier in 
scenario 2 and maintenance interventions can be more frequent. The design require-
ments of the fridges for the two scenarios fulfilling the same functional unit are  
therefore quite different, however in this simplified analysis, it is supposed that their  
impacts are equivalent. In the second scenario, thanks to the expert team and the  
supervision module, the fridge’s life time is extended by 25%. The impacts of the 
components are therefore reduced proportionally. To summarize, DB1 considers only 
the control and supervision modules, whereas the integration of DB2 means taking the 
fridge into account. To simplify, the pump is excluded from the scope of this study 
and considered as being available all the time. The technical descriptions of the scena-
rios are presented in Table 2.

Environmental Evaluation of the Buckles  
The environmental analysis is done on the first DB and then on both the first and the 
second DBs comparing the two scenarios in each case. The analysis shows that  
the two scenarios have almost equivalent environmental impacts for DB1, and the 

212

scenario 1 seems to be slightly more environmentally-friendly than scenario 2 (see 
Figure 4). But when considering the two DBs simultaneously, scenario 2 has less 
environmental impacts than the scenario 1 (see Figure 5).

Discussion 
This study shows how the design buckles can be used during an environmental as-
sessment of different solutions. Using the DBs, the interactions between the solutions 
and the function fulfilled are clarified very simply. DB1 satisfies the function of  
control of the fridge’s performance. Environmental impacts generated by a remote 
module are higher than for the on-site control module, because of the associated ICT 
network and equipments. However, when both DB1 and DB2 are considered, the 
links between the designs of the solutions to fulfill the technical functions can be 
discussed. Several issues are raised, such as the expected results of the new services 
introduced by scenario 2. For example, in scenario 2 of DB2, designers can decide to 
introduce a less reliable fridge  taking advantage of the efficient additional repair 
services; or, as chosen in the study,  use better services with a robust fridge to extend 
its’ life time. All these solutions fulfill the same functional unit. The choice depends 
on many parameters, other than environmental considerations. Therefore the assess-
ment proposed here could be extended to other criteria, such as cost, user’s accep-
tance, etc. The method links the DBs with the solutions and identifies issues for  
designers. The re-design of the fridge, for example, should be discussed to improve 
the environmental performance of DB2. The case study is simplified but can be com-
pleted more precisely by integrating information on the environmental impacts of the 
infrastructures. The tools and working spaces used by the on-site team (scenario 1) or 
the equipments used by the supervision unit (scenario 2) can be integrated into the 
analysis. The same method can be extended to a more detailed study taking into  
account a complete environmental analysis of the solutions. 
Nevertheless, the study shows that, even with the simplifications made, a simpli-
fied assessment performed on the two DBs provides a quick understanding of the 
issues involved. In the case study, the second scenario appears as the better choice. 
The impacts generated using the ICT network are compensated by the prolonged life 
time of the fridge. This preliminary analysis is helpful to understand ways to improve 
the environmental performances of the solutions (for example, extended life time); or 
to choose between different scenarios.

Conclusion 
This paper supports the idea that the design buckle objects are useful for the design of 
eco-efficient PSS. Design buckles make the links between the functions to provide, 
the expected functional/operational behaviors and the possible solutions, appear clear-
ly. This representation helps designers to evaluate the environmental performances of 
a set of solutions linked by their functional and behavior aspects. A method to assess 
the entire system would be time consuming and very difficult during the conceptual 
design phase. Design buckles are a sort of intermediary objects of design by which a 
quick understanding of the interactions in the organization of the system is made 
possible. In this way alternatives for solutions can be easily identified and assessed. A 
comparison of these alternatives can be done conveniently. The results can support 
decision-making even when full knowledge on the design objects is not yet available.

Abstract. Recently, a system called the Product-Service System (PSS) has been 
attracting attention. Since a PSS includes a broad range of customer needs, 
compared with a product-selling business, there are many business opportuni-
ties for manufacturers that correspond to possible candidates of a PSS provider. 
This study aims to support manufacturers’ trying to find new business oppor-
tunities by offering PSSs. To do so, this study assumes that it is useful for man-
ufacturers to explore technologies that can be applied to fulfill customer needs 
in a PSS. In addition, these technologies should be explored across different 
business areas. The objective of this study is therefore to propose a method for 
classifying various business technologies from the viewpoint of customer needs 
in a PSS. The proposed method thereby enables manufacturers to explore tech-
nologies for fulfilling customer needs.

Introduction 
At present, since many products are involved in low-price competition against prod-
ucts produced with cheaper labor, it is difficult for many manufacturers to make their 
business more profitable by only selling products [1]. Against this background, a 
system called the Product-Service System (PSS) has been attracting attention. PSSs, 
which offer a product in combination with services, are a specific type of value prop-
osition that a business offers to its customers [2-4]. A PSS consists of a mix of tangi-
ble products and intangible services designed and combined so that jointly they are 
capable of fulfilling final customer needs [2-4]. 
PSS providers need to fulfill customer needs in product usage as well as in the oth-
er customer activities related to the product, such as maintenance, installation, train-
ing, and so on [2]. A PSS includes a broad range of customer needs, compared with a 
product-selling business. In other words, there are many business opportunities for 
manufacturers that correspond to possible candidates of a PSS provider. In order to 

216 
K. Kimita and Y. Shimomura 
 
fulfill such broad customer needs, the technologies required in a PSS usually include 
not only one of the core products but also ones from different business areas. For 
example, in a car-sharing business, the PSS provider needs to use technologies of the 
core product, i.e., a car, as well as technologies from different business areas, such as 
monitoring techniques to manage the availability of the car. However, problems re-
main in exploring technologies across different business areas. For many manufactur-
ers, technologies are generally managed with respect to each business and/or product 
area, and therefore it is difficult for them to explore technologies for a PSS across 
different business areas. This situation makes it difficult for them to find new business 
opportunities in order to move away from a business selling products toward a busi-
ness offering a PSS. 
This study aims to support manufacturers’ trying to find new business opportuni-
ties by offering PSSs. To do so, this study assumes that it is useful for manufacturers 
to explore technologies that can be applied to fulfill customer needs in a PSS. In addi-
tion, these technologies should be explored across different business areas. The objec-
tive of this study is therefore to propose a method for classifying various business 
technologies from the viewpoint of customer needs in a PSS. The proposed method 
thereby enables manufacturers to explore technologies for fulfilling customer needs. 
The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in an application of a PSS 
to a gas turbine business, a case in which a heavy industrial company corresponded to 
a provider.

Approach of This Study 
2.1 
Overview 
In order to explore technologies for fulfilling customer needs in a PSS, in the pro-
posed method, technologies held by a manufacturer are classified from the viewpoint 
of customer needs in the PSS. To do so, first, customer needs are extracted in consid-
eration of product usage as well as in the other customer activities related to the  
product. For the extraction, a method called Business-Process and Goal-Oriented 
Requirements Analysis [5-6] is adopted. Secondly, technologies held by a manufac-
turer are classified based on several dimensions. As to the dimensions, in the pro-
posed method, customer needs extracted by the requirement analysis are used. In 
addition, the self-organizing map (SOM) [7] is used as the classification and visuali-
zation tool. In the remainder of this section, first, the methods for the requirement 
analysis and the SOM are introduced, and then, the procedure for exploring PSS  
technologies is proposed. 
2.2 
Method for Extracting Customer Needs 
To analyze the customer and to identify requirements in a business to business (B2B) 
service, a method called Business-Process and Goal-Oriented Requirements Analysis 
has been proposed [5-6]. 

 
A Method for Exploring PSS Technologies Based on Customer Needs 
217 
 
The first step in this method is reanalyzing the business to identify customers. 
Market surveys, interviews, or questionnaires are useful for this step. Based on the 
collected data, customers’ business activities are modeled visually, and goals, which 
indicate objectives that should be achieved for each business task [8], are identified 
for each business activity. The modeled customer’s business activities are then trans-
lated into a service script. The service script is written in natural language; thus, it 
enables designers to analyze the customer’s behavior in more detail. From the script, 
designers identify some “key words” that can be considered important elements for 
the PSS. Finally, each key word is associated with required items/qualities and quality 
elements using a predefined template and vocabulary list (see Figure 1). Here, “re-
quired items” refers to what customers want to do, and “required quality” is a linguis-
tic expression of customer needs related to the quality of the provided product/service 
[9]; namely, the required items/qualities indicate representations of “customer needs” 
in a PSS. On the other hand, quality elements work as criteria for evaluating the quali-
ty [9]. Thus, the quality elements are observable and controllable for designers and 
could be regarded as requirements in a PSS, since these are elements that satisfy the 
required items/qualities, i.e., customer needs.

The Self-organizing Map 
The SOM [7] is a useful tool for the visualization of multidimensional data. It con-
verts complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data into 
simple geometric relationships on a display that is usually represented as two  
dimensions, i.e., a map. The map consists of elements that are associated with

high-dimensional data. Based on the high-dimensional data, in the SOM, these ele-
ments become ordered on the map so that similar elements are close to each other and 
dissimilar elements are far from each other. Since the SOM compresses information 
about high-dimensional data while preserving the most important topological and 
metric relationships among elements on the display, results of the SOM can be useful 
for carrying out classification, data mining, visualization, and so forth. For example, 
Yoon applied the SOM to R&D management by representing complex relationship 
among patents and the dynamic pattern of technological advancement [10]. On the 
other hand, in order to support designers’ idea generation in PSS design, Akasaka 
proposed the PSS Business Case Map where the SOM was adopted as a mapping tool 
[11]. As shown in Figure 2, in this method, PSS business cases are located on the map 
based on their similarities; the similarities are evaluated by high-dimensional data 
consisting of the types of product, service, customer, and added value [11].

Procedure for Exploring PSS Technologies Based on 
Customer Needs 
3.1 
Step1: Extraction of Customer Needs 
From the viewpoint of offering products in combination with services, value is always 
determined by customers [2]. Therefore, this procedure begins with the extraction of 
customer needs in a PSS. For the extraction, the method for requirement analysis that 
is introduced in section 2.2, is adopted. First, the business’s core product is analyzed 
to identify possible customers in a PSS. Customers’ business activities related to the 
core product are subsequently described based on market surveys, interviews, ques-
tionnaires, and so on. In each business activity, goals, which indicate objectives that 
should be achieved for each business task, are identified. Next, the described custom-
er’s business activities are translated into a service script to analyze the customer’s 
behavior in more detail. According to the script, finally, customer needs in the PSS 
are extracted. In this method, customer requirements are represented as the required

quality, which is a linguistic expression of customer needs related to the quality of the 
provided product/service. 
3.2 
Step2: Classification of Technologies from the Viewpoint  
of Customer Needs 
According to the customer needs extracted in the previous step, technologies held by 
a manufacturer, which corresponds to a PSS provider, are classified by using the 
SOM. In the proposed method, the extracted customer needs are used as dimensions 
for the classification. As a unit of “technology,” a patent and/or technical report 
would be suitable. This information should be collected from the core product, as well 
as from different business areas. Each technology is associated with customer needs 
that possibly can be fulfilled by the technology; similarities among technologies are 
evaluated by the dimensions, i.e., the customer needs. Each technology is thereby 
located on the map so that similar technologies are close to each other and dissimilar 
technologies far from each other. As classifications of the technologies, finally, clus-
ters of technologies are identified on the map. Each cluster consists of technologies 
that possibly fulfill similar customer requirements. 
3.3 
Step3: Exploring Technologies Applied to a PSS 
Based on the clusters identified in the previous step, the manufacturer is able to ex-
plore technologies across different business areas for fulfilling customer needs in the 
PSS. If a cluster contains technologies of both the core product and different business 
areas, technologies of the core product could be enhanced to fulfill relevant customer 
needs, in combination with the technologies from different business areas. If a cluster 
contains technologies only from different business areas, these technologies can be 
applied to fulfill relevant customer needs, and worked as supplemental technologies 
in order to realize the PSS of the core product. In addition, combining technologies 
from these clusters enables the manufacturer to offer a PSS that can fulfill customer 
needs more comprehensively; it results in increasing their business opportunities 
around the core product.

Application 
4.1 
Objective of This Application 
The proposed method was applied to a PSS of gas turbine business, a case in which a 
heavy industrial company corresponded to a provider. Recently, a demand for power 
supply is increasing in many emerging countries. As a result, in emerging countries 
that have vast national territories and problems with their power grid systems, elec-
trical power failure often occurs in areas far from electricity-generation plants. In 
addition, as an environmental consciousness increases in these countries, power gen-
eration systems with low CO2 emission and low energy consumption are required

much more. In accord with this situation, the dispersed power system has grown in 
importance in many emerging countries. Especially as a source of power supply for 
the dispersed power system, gas turbines have been attracting attention. Since some 
parts of gas turbines are used in harsh conditions, such as high temperature and/or 
high centrifugal force, these parts need to be repaired and exchanged in a short period. 
As users of gas turbines increase in emerging countries, its manufacturers are much 
more often required to rapidly address trouble with and failures of gas turbines. 
Therefore, the manufacturers need to not only provide a product itself, i.e., a gas tur-
bine, but also offer a PSS that includes the product-related services, such as monitor-
ing, customer supports, maintenance, and so forth. 
This application aims to explore technologies that can be applied to realize a PSS 
for a gas turbine in emerging countries. In particular, in this application, the gas tur-
bine, which corresponds to the core product, is provided by a heavy industrial compa-
ny that conducts several businesses, involving airplanes, ships, plants, and so forth. 
Technologies were therefore collected from the business areas conducted by the  
company.

Results: Classification of Technologies for a PSS of Gas Turbine Business 
Step1: Extraction of Customer Needs. For the extraction of customer needs, first, 
business of a gas turbine was analyzed, and then, an operator managing dispersed 
power systems for industrial sectors was identified as a customer in the PSS. Custom-
er’s business activities related to the gas turbine were subsequently described based 
on market surveys. Eight activities related to the gas turbine were identified: installa-
tion, operation, monitoring, diagnosis, maintenance planning, prevention, mainten-
ance, and emergency response. The described customer’s business activities were 
translated into a service script to analyze the customer’s behavior in more detail.  
Table 1 shows the result of the service script in each business activities. According to 
the script, finally, customer needs in the PSS were extracted as shown in the right row 
in Table 1. For example, from the activity “monitoring,” where customers collect and 
analyze data about conditions of the gas turbine, “efficiency of data collection and 
analysis” was extracted as a customer need for the PSS. 
Step2: Classification of Technologies from the Viewpoint of Customer Needs. 
According to the customer needs extracted in the previous step, technologies of the 
heavy industrial company were classified by using the SOM. In this procedure, the 
eight extracted customer needs were used as dimensions for the classifications. As a 
unit of “technology” of the heavy industrial company, technical reports published by 
the company were used. In such technical reports, the company introduces its new 
technology and product in a manner similar to academic journal papers, and therefore, 
one technical report can be considered as one technology. Technical reports were 
collected from twelve businesses areas conducted by the heavy industrial company, 
such as airplanes, ships, plants, robots, trains, and so forth. As a result, 123 reports 
were collected as sources of technologies. Each technology introduced in a technical 
report was associated with customer needs that possibly could be fulfilled by the 
technology, and then similarities among technologies were evaluated according to the

Installation 
For the installation of a gas turbine, we need to consider the weight of the 
gas turbine as well as its vibration. Since this vibration causes hazardous 
noises, users of the gas turbine need to take a measure to reduce this vibra-
tion. In addition, a gas turbine requires large amount of air supply and 
exhaust compared to a diesel engine, and therefore, the users need to pre-
pare enough space to install it. Using a gas turbine in a cold weather region, 
we need to keep its heat to prevent failures. Using it in a high altitude re-
gion, on the other hand, its performance deteriorates to 90 to 95 percent.
- Noise-
reduction 
- Flexibility of 
the space for 
the installation 
- Robustness in 
a high altitude 
region 
Operation 
Recently, due to restructuring efforts for operating gas turbines, the shortage 
of operators who have lots of knowledge and technique about gas turbines 
become serious problems. This situation increases the occurrence of failures 
in operating gas turbines. 
- Reduction of 
operation cost 
- Knowledge of 
operators 
Monitoring 
In order to detect potential failures and to cope with them, it is an effective 
measure to collect and analyze lots of data about a gas turbine, such as
temperature and pressure, by using many sensors. However, compared with 
gas turbines held by electrical power suppliers, gas turbines used in general
enterprises for their power supply have small number of sensors. This is 
because that gas turbines of electrical power suppliers can be a large size for 
the purpose of selling electrical power, and therefore, it is possible to equip 
lots of sensors to monitor the its performance precisely. On the other hand, 
the gas turbine for general enterprise is usually used for the purpose of cost 
reduction. Its sensors are therefore kept to the minimum necessary to moni-
tor it. 
- Efficiency of 
data collection 
and analysis 
Diagnosis 
Some parts of gas turbine are used in harsh conditions, user need to check 
their damages during both operation and maintenance, and to make a deci-
sion correctly if they have to repair, disposal or continue to use the parts. In 
order to reduce maintenance cost, users need to reduce the number of times 
for replacing parts by using technologies to extend life time of the parts. 
However, since the life time are influenced by various factors, it is difficult 
to develop technologies for life time assessment that can be applied to all 
situations. Therefore the life time assessment need to be carried out based 
on the data result from the analysis and evaluation of actual operating con-
ditions. 
- Promptness of 
responses 
- Accuracy of 
life time eval-
uation 
Maintenance 
planning 
Parts used in high temperature need to use special techniques in repairing, 
and therefore, it takes longer time to repair them compared with the other 
parts. Therefore, users need to predict their life time, and to prepare alterna-
tives of them. 
- Adequacy of 
the mainten-
ance plan 
Prevention 
In the electricity-generation plants where demands for high efficiency and 
operation availability are prioritized, users need technologies to prevent 
failures, such as delay to start running, preventing accidents and so on. 
- Accuracy of 
preventions 
Maintenance 
Recently, for the purpose of increasing the operation availability, users 
reduce the number of times for maintenance. This situation causes failures 
of quality frequently. Therefore, it is required to increase the efficiency of 
the maintenance. In addition, due to merger and acquisition between com-
panies those provide gas turbine, users are not necessarily receiving main-
tenance even if they used to receive it. According to this situation, some 
users are trying to avoid relying on original companies providing gas tur-
bine about maintenance. 
- Safety of 
maintenance 
- Efficiency of 
maintenance 
- Consistency of 
maintenance 
Emergency 
Response 
For emergency cases, such as natural disasters, it is required to keep robust-
ness to use electricity as much as possible. For example, under the situation 
limited to supply electricity, gas turbine manufactures and users need to 
consider systems that supply electricity to high prioritized facilities, such as 
equipment in a hospital. In addition, dispersing systems for the connection 
and control about power supply enable users to keep functions of the system 
even if a part of them are broken down.

customer needs. Each technology was thereby located on the map so that similar 
technologies were close to each other and dissimilar technologies far from each other. 
As for classifications of the technologies, as shown in Figure 3, ten clusters of tech-
nologies, in which technologies in the same cluster are colored with the same one, 
were identified on the map. For example, as shown in Table 2, cluster colored with 
green consisted of 7 technologies, such as “I2: a technology for an urban transporta-
tion system,” “A6: a technology for gas turbines,” and “J3: a technology for capaci-
tors in train systems.” In addition, “X” in Table 2 shows the association between the 
technologies and customer needs. The technologies in the cluster colored with green 
were associated with eight customer needs: “Noise-reduction,” “Flexibility of the 
space for the installation,” and “Reduction of operation cost.” For example, a technol-
ogy described in the technical report, “I2: a technology for an urban transportation 
system,” was associated with customer needs: “Reduction of operation cost” and 
“Robustness of power supply.”

Step3: Exploring Technologies Applied to a PSS. Based on the clusters identified in 
the previous step, the company was able to explore technologies across different busi-
ness areas for fulfilling customer needs in the PSS. For example, the cluster colored 
with green contained technologies of both the gas turbine and different business areas, 
such as “I2: a technology for an urban transportation system,” “E11: a technology for 
solar power generation systems in plants,” and “F9: a technology for container ves-
sels.” The technology of the gas turbine could be enhanced to fulfill relevant customer 
needs, in combination with the technologies from different business areas. In order to 
enhance the fulfillment of customer need “Robustness of power supply,” the company 
could use the technology of a train management system that realized a power supply 
in the case of emergency, which is introduced in “J3: a technology for capacitors in 
train systems”. On the other hand, a cluster colored with gray contained technologies 
only from different business areas, such as “D4: a technology for the information 
system about production management,” “L4: a technology for the transfer robot of 
semiconductors,” and “L5: a technology for operating robots.” These technologies

Discussion 
In this study, the proposed method was applied to the PSS of a gas turbine business, a 
case in which a heavy industrial company corresponded to the provider. An operator 
managing dispersed power systems for industrial sectors was identified as a customer, 
and then their business activities were analyzed to extract their needs. As a result, 
eight customer needs were extracted. Meanwhile, as to the technologies of the heavy 
industrial company, 123 technical reports were collected, and then these technologies 
were classified into the ten clusters from the viewpoint of the customer’s needs. From 
clusters containing technologies of both the gas turbine and different business areas, 
for example, the cluster colored with green, technologies that could enhance

technologies of the gas turbine were explored. With regard to clusters containing 
technologies only from different business areas, for example, the cluster colored with 
gray, technologies that could be worked as supplemental technologies to realize the 
PSS of the gas turbine were explored. Since these technologies are currently not ap-
plied to the gas turbine business, the proposed method is effective for the company to 
explore technologies that can be applied to fulfill customer needs in a PSS. In addi-
tion, these technologies included gas turbine technologies as well as technologies 
from different business areas. This means that the proposed method enables the com-
pany to explore technologies in different business areas. The result of the method is 
useful to develop a realization structure for customer needs in the PSS design. For 
example, Shimomura proposes a function model for the PSS design, called view 
model [12]. The view model represents functional relationship between customer 
needs and entities. Designers first develop functions that fulfill the customer needs, 
and then, deploy these functions into detail. The detail functions are associated with 
entities. Technologies explored in the proposed method are useful to determine func-
tions and entities in the view model. In combination of the proposed method with PSS 
design methods, such as the view model, the result of the method is useful for the 
company trying to find new business opportunities by offering a PSS. 
In this application, however, the technologies of the heavy industrial company 
were associated with customer needs manually. This procedure imposes a high work-
load. In addition, its results may easily include bias from the people who follow this 
procedure. To solve this problem, a method for designing knowledge management 
[13] could be used. In this method, design knowledge would be associated with quali-
ty items automatically. Such a method would be expected to associate technologies 
with customer needs automatically. In order to apply this method to the association of 
technologies with customer needs in the proposed method, first, we need to develop 
an on ontology of customer needs in PSSs. The database of technologies is subse-
quently constructed. Each technology in the database is associated with at least one 
primal customer need, and then, relevant customer needs are automatically associated 
with the technology according to the ontology of customer needs.

Conclusion 
In order for manufacturers to find new business opportunities by offering a PSS, this 
paper proposed a method for classifying various business technologies in a PSS from 
the viewpoint of customer needs. Applying this proposed method revealed that it 
would be effective for manufacturers that are exploring technologies that could be 
applied to fulfill customer needs in a PSS. In addition, these technologies could in-
clude technologies of a core product as well as technologies from different business 
areas. Therefore, the proposed method is useful for manufacturers looking for new 
business opportunities in a PSS. 
Future studies will include a method to reduce the workload and bias in the associ-
ation of technologies with customer needs.

Abstract. This paper examines business models and product service systems in 
the chemical industry. Three main players are currently involved on the market 
(equipment manufacturers, plant engineering companies and plant operators). 
Business models between engineering companies and plant operators are trans-
action oriented. Services such as maintenance and continuous improvements are 
not standard practice. As modular transformable production concepts emerge, 
the market structure is due to change. A new player, the module manufacturer, 
joins the market and competes with plant engineering companies. A modular 
and decentralized production concept requires different business models and 
service offers such as remote control or module substitution. Business models 
between operator and module manufacturers have to be more service orientated 
with risks shifting more towards the module manufacturer’s side. 
Keywords: product service systems, business models, chemical industry, mod-
ular production concept, container modules.

Introduction 
At present plant engineering in the process industry is characterized by limited inte-
raction between the plant engineering and the operator company during the operation 
phase. In addition plants are usually constructed ready-to-use, terminating the busi-
ness relationships with the start of production. Services such as maintenance, repair 
and overhaul are carried out by the operator himself. Plant construction is thus dic-
tated by cost effects in order to reach economies of scale. Nevertheless companies in 
the chemical process industry are facing the challenges of increased competition, 
pressure on costs, lead times and quality, shortened product life cycles and increased 
product differentiation. Additionally markets are becoming more volatile. This leads 
to increasingly low utilization and shortfalls of products. Meanwhile central produc-
tion sites which are often far away from customers do not allow for lean supply  
chain and production processes. When new products emerge, equipment cannot be 
transformed as quickly as needed.  

228 
S. Lier, D. Wörsdörfer, and J. Gesing 
Therefore, new transformable, mutable and versatile production concepts for the 
process industry are at the stage of development, attending to these challenges. Mod-
ularized production systems can be operated decentralized at customers’ locations. 
Consequently these new production concepts require new business relationships that 
span the whole product life-cycle as the customer may not possess the required know-
how and resources. Hence, plant engineering companies and equipment manufactur-
ers start offering operating services such as maintenance, repair and overhaul. In order 
to perform services more efficiently, process and equipment development are increa-
singly merging together ensuring short times to market. Therefore, product service 
systems (PSS) are starting to evolve within the process industry. 
The paper at hand seeks to analyze the status-quo of business models in the process 
industry. Based on this, a scenario is set up which deals with the developments of PSS 
in this area. New structures including business relationships and alternative business 
models are proposed for transformable production concepts. Therefore two in-depth 
interviews with main players in the industry have been conducted.

Business Models for PSS 
Business models for PSS are “characterizing the relationship between a customer and 
a provider (network)” [1]. Hence, a business model settles the value creation and deli-
very for customers, how the customer pays for this value, how profits are derived and 
elements of the value chain [2]. For PSS every customer-supplier relationship is cha-
racterized by a specific business model. 
Rese, Meier, Gesing, Boßlau (2012) have identified three categories of business 
models which differ in their degree of collaboration between customer and supplier 
during the operation phase. The lowest degree of collaboration is present in transac-
tion-based business models. In these models products or services are sold as part of 
one-time transactions. These models do not represent PSS since products and services 
are not integrated and no long-term relationship is established. The supplier sells the 
products and/or services and the customer operates them himself.  
In provider-driven business models the supplier takes over most of the processes 
from his customer during the operation. These consist, for example, of build-own-
operate models. The provider is responsible for performing the processes and sells the 
result of these processes to his customer.  
In between these two models collaboration intense business models are situated. 
They distinguish themselves through a high degree of collaboration. In these models 
customer and supplier both conduct sub-processes within the customer’s overall pro-
duction process and hence have to collaborate and coordinate. 
Furthermore business models are composed of different parts. Rese, Meier, Gesing, 
Boßlau (2012) set up a morphology in which they identified five characteristics of a 
business model. The value proposition depicts the value that is delivered to the cus-
tomer [3]. In the case of transaction-based business models the value is delivered 
offering only products or services and not PSS. In the case of collaboration intense 
business models the value is determined by an integrated combination of products and 

 
Business Models and PSS for Transformable, Modular Plants 
229 
services, e.g. a guaranteed availability. In provider-driven business models the pro-
vider guarantees the result of a certain process. 
A consequence of the value proposition of a PSS is the division of labor. Agreeing 
upon different value propositions simultaneously results in different responsibilities in 
the production process shown in the organization model. Thus, it describes the re-
sponsibility during usage and thus the degree of co-creation.  
In agreeing on a PSS, customer and supplier automatically have to agree on risk 
sharing issues [4]. For instance if the supplier guarantees a contractual performance, 
the risk of early wear out of physical parts or obsolescence shifts to his side. Addi-
tional risks also arise in cooperative agreements due to interdependencies between the 
partners [5].  
Delivering value and sharing risks is always connected to some kind of compensa-
tion for the supplier, which is analyzed in the revenue model [3]. When selling prod-
ucts or services in time-to-time transactions the basic and most commonly used way 
of compensation is a one-off payment. In the case of PSS revenues change and cover 
the whole life cycle. The property rights determine who owns the rights to the physi-
cal part (e.g. machines) of the PSS.

Methodology 
To assess the status quo and possible developments in the chemical industry the au-
thors conducted in-depth interviews with different companies. One interview was 
conducted with a plant engineering company and one with a plant operator. Each 
interview was conducted by two to three researchers and lasted between 80 and 120 
minutes. The companies interviewed are described in table 1.

Business Models and PSS for Transformable, Modular Plants 
231 
The interviewed plant engineering company outlined two ways on how to sell 
chemical plants. First, operators ask for turnkey plants, merely communicating their 
requirements in advance. The plant is built according to these requirements by the 
plant engineering company and sold in a onetime transaction for a lump sum. Second, 
some customers want to co-develop the plant with the engineering company. In this 
case the development is marked by a higher degree of interaction. Some customers 
even take over single engineering services themselves. The payment is characterized 
by single prices for parts and different reimbursable engineering services. Meanwhile, 
at the time when the plant is readily constructed, the operator takes over the whole 
responsibility. Hence, in both cases the plant is solely operated by the operation com-
pany. During the operation phase little interaction between the three parties occurs. 
Except for single spare-part businesses or process optimizing and upgrading, no fur-
ther relationship evolves. In case of shortfalls the plant operator either contacts the 
engineering company or gets in touch with the equipment manufacturer. Plants are 
usually constructed for huge production volumes in order to reach economies of scale. 
The operators of these large plants possess great know-how which enables them to 
take over maintenance and repair services.  
Thus, the business model applied in the current chemical industry is a transactional 
one. The specifications of the different characteristics of the business model described 
above are shown in figure 1). 
The value that is delivered to the customer is the property of the chemical plant. 
The operator takes over the whole responsibility during the operation phase, whereas 
the supplier is only responsible for specification and installation. Hence, the risks that 
can occur during the operation phase lie on the customer’s side as well. The provider 
only takes over risks until the plant is ready for operation. Nevertheless, in the case of 
huge chemical plants the investment risks on the supplier’s side are high. Revenues 
are generated accordingly on a transactional basis. The customer either pays for single 
engineering services or a lump sum prior to operating the plant. Since the value deli-
vered is the property of the plant, the customer gains the ownership. 
3.3 
New Technologies and Production Concepts in the Chemical Industry 
The chemical industry still focuses on economies of scale and therefore builds its 
plants as large and as optimized as possible [6, 7]. But this industry faces more and 
more volatile, global customer demands, shortened product life-cycles and an increas-
ing product variation which lead to uncertain forecasts [9, 10]. As large-scale plants 
are very inflexible regarding output numbers, assortment and local positions, modular, 
transformable production concepts emerge in order to increase flexibility [11, 12]. In 
this context a module is defined as a technical and organizational separated part of a 
chemical plant which represents a standardized, operational and autonomous unit [8]. 
Modularity is distinguished between serial and parallel modularity regarding different 
scale-levels. Serial modularity means the selection, order and substitution of single, 
standardized apparatus in order to gain different production lines. Whereas parallel 
modularity means numbering up the same production line as often as necessary in 
order to serve market demands. The combination of parallel and serial modularity 
leads to a modular multi-purpose plant as shown in figure 2. 

232 
S. Lier, D. Wörsdörfer, and J. Gesing 
 
Fig. 2. Parallel and serial modularity [8] 
Modular chemical plants owning one process line have got a fraction of the size of 
traditional plants. They consist of standardized and, depending on the requirements, 
process intensified apparatuses with homogenous interfaces, which are taken from a 
toolbox. Apparatus can be integrated in a given backbone-system that has the  
dimensions of an ISO-container [11]. This backbone system provides standardized 
interfaces to the environment and supplies the apparatus with the required energy and 
utilities. Figure 3 shows such a production container developed by the research center 
“invite” in Leverkusen. The production mode of a container module is preferably 
continuous. As the usage of ISO-containers offers mobility, the standardization of 
apparatuses provides product flexibility and short lead times. In addition output num-
bers can easily be adapted by adding or removing containers.

Hence, on the one hand the loss of economies of scale and no longer optimized, in-
dividual adapted process parameters display the disadvantages of modular production 
plants. On the other hand modular concepts offer flexibility and faster process devel-
opment and plant construction in contrast to conventional plants. Furthermore mod-
ules are built more than once. Thus module investment costs are going to decrease 
because of experience and learning effects. 
Regarding quantified economical terms Lier and Grünewald examined the net 
present value of a large-scale plant in contrast to a modular plant concept with the 
same capacity. Due to shorter time-to-market the modular plant gains earlier revenues 
and therefore obtains an earlier break-even point whereas the large-scale plant lags 
behind by years. But at a certain point, due to economies of scale, the large-scale 
plant overtakes the modular plant. The main influencing parameter on the net present 
value can be identified in the course of product demand (Lier & Grünewald 2011).  
Modular production plants provide the possibility to relocate production directly at 
customers’ sites. Thus product transportation can be reduced to a minimum while 
just-in-time concepts, which are not possible in conventional environments, can 
emerge. Additionally assembly and construction of modules can be performed at a 
manufacturer’s home location, for modules are distributed afterwards to their specific 
destination. In case of shortfalls during operation either single apparatuses or the en-
tire ISO-container can be substituted quickly. This scenario of a decentralized produc-
tion requires new services such as maintenance or remote control because the staff at 
decentralized locations does not possess the same know-how about operating the con-
tainer-module as at a central location. Furthermore new business models can emerge 
since operator models become attractive. The following section 3.4 describes these 
changes in services and business models in detail. 
3.4 
Changes in the Business Model 
When modular production concepts emerge in the chemical industry new balances 
will result between the involved players. The reason for this is that probably a com-
pletely new player, the module manufacturer, occurs on the market. The first question 
is which current market player (the plant engineering company, the plant operator or 
the equipment manufacturer) is going to evolve to such a module manufacturer.  
Considering the equipment manufacturer there is a lack of know-how and expertise 
about process development and management of the whole production process. Nowa-
days the communication between plant engineering companies and equipment manu-
facturers is reduced to a minimum due to intellectual property protection issues. The 
equipment manufacturer does not supply one customer exclusively. Therefore the 
company gets just as much information as needed from the engineering company in 
order to produce appropriate apparatuses. 
The plant operator lacks engineering competences. This implies that this company 
is yet neither able to design and construct proper apparatuses nor to combine appara-
tuses and configure transportation and interface devices such as pipes for the desired 
process. Nevertheless, the operator possesses know-how of product development, 
process parameters and operation of the plant and has contacts to current product 

234 
S. Lier, D. Wörsdörfer, and J. Gesing 
customers for selling the product. Thus operators know required product specifica-
tions and how to obtain them with chemical reactions and further unit operations. 
The engineering plant company has no or only minimal experiences in adjustment 
of process operating parameters. In addition, due to intellectual protection issues, 
equipment manufacturers are sometimes restricted in their publication of experiences 
made with other plant engineering companies. This again shows the conflict of inter-
ests between the three main players on the market. Furthermore engineering compa-
nies do not possess enough human capacity to run several chemical plants in addition. 
Most engineering companies are specified in certain chemical products. They develop 
their specific technologies. This gives them unique selling points and strong market 
positions. Thus they probably do not have any interest in changing their business 
models, because there is no reason to do so. 
After considering all current market players no one seems to be dedicated to evolve 
into a module manufacturer at the moment. Hence, either one of the current players 
has to develop into a module manufacturer or a fourth player will take this part. For 
example companies that are dealing with process intensified technologies possess the 
essential know-how and they combine necessary requirements such as an established 
network, manpower and technology knowledge. Therefore these companies have got 
the potential to become a module manufacturer.  
Figure 4 gives an overview on how the market structure can be set up and how the 
players’ interactions might change when modular production concepts emerge. The 
left part of figure 4 shows the traditional interactions of market players as earlier  
described in this paper. The right part shows a possible situation for modular systems.

The relationship between plant operator and customer will not be influenced by the 
production concept. The customers demand the product and its specification without 
any interests in the underlying production process as long as the product quality and 
price are appropriate. But they would probably prefer a production site in their sur-
roundings.  
The plant operating company gets the possibility to choose between the modular 
production concept and the traditional large scale production. The decision about the 
production concept depends on two product attributes. The first one is whether the 
product is a bulk-chemical or a fine-chemical product. Bulk-chemicals are defined by 
huge, steady customer demands, while fine-chemical demands are relatively small 
and volatile. On the one hand, in the case of bulk-chemicals, a traditional large-
production concept can be preferred due to economies of scale. On the other hand a 
modular production concept will likely be chosen if the product is a fine-chemical due 
to low production volume and more flexibility.  
The second product attribute which influences the production concept decision is 
the position of the production process in the value chain. If the process describes a 
core product conversion, which is followed by several further conversion steps, the 
preferred concept will likely be the large-scale plant. Vice versa, if the considered 
process is a finishing and conditioning step the modular production concept will come 
into consideration. Thus the traditional plant engineering company will compete with 
the module manufacturer depending on the production concept preferred by the plant 
operator.  
The business models between plant operator and engineering company has been 
described and analyzed in chapter 3.2. The interactions between plant operator and 
module manufacturer are described henceforth. The module manufacturer will be 
mainly delivered by micro or milli equipment companies as process intensified tech-
nologies are preferably built into container modules. In addition further equipment 
manufacturers will supply the module manufacturer with comprehensive equipment 
such as pipes and instruments. 
New services between plant operators and module manufacturers will emerge 
when container modules are located decentralized and not necessarily integrated in a 
chemical park. The module manufacturer is able to move modules to locations where 
they are needed. Thus, depending on the product lifecycle, modules are added or re-
moved. During inspections apparatuses do not necessarily need to be repaired on site. 
Instead apparatus modules can be completely substituted. Thus value production time 
can be gained. Furthermore business models between operators and module manufac-
turers change in contrast to those of conventional plant engineering companies. For 
example leasing contracts become attractive as modules are not custom specified and 
are not fixed at dedicated locations. The following figure 5 illustrates an example for 
a likely business model between a plant operator and a module manufacturer. This 
business model describes only one possible scenario derived from the conducted in-
dustry interviews since container- modules are not on the market yet.

responsible for running the module. The risks now mainly shift towards the provider’s 
side. He now takes over the risks for modules life-cycle activities, for module availa-
bility and, together with the operator, the risks of results from the use of the product. 
Market risks lie on the operator’s side. Considering revenues a wide range of interac-
tions is possible. A sales model based on a utilization period is as appropriate as a 
revenue model based on availability or on results. That decision really depends on the 
involved companies and their preferences. The modules stay in the ownership of the 
module manufacturer who distributes and coordinates them to operators’ locations. 
Owning a huge bulk of modules gives the module manufacturer the opportunity to 
react flexible and quickly to customers’ demands. All in all the module manufacturer 
takes over more risks, offers a product-service orientated solution and gets paid over 
the life-cycle.

Conclusion 
Based on the conducted interviews comprehensive product service systems over the 
entire product life cycle are not in demand within current production technologies in 
the chemical industry. But as new production concepts like modular production plants 
emerge dedicated services and thereby product service systems are indispensable for a 
successful establishment. Thus new production technologies are only attractive ac-
companied by new services and vice versa product service systems in the chemical 
industry become especially relevant with the introduction of modular production  
concepts. 
Today the relationship between a plant engineering company and a plant operator 
in the chemical industry is very separated and restricted. In extreme cases the operator 
is purely investment orientated, not interested in any engineering processes. Vice 
versa, the plant engineering company does not offer any further services while the 
plant is in operation. Such a business model is characterized as transaction orientated. 
This is due to change when modular production concepts emerge on the market. As a 
result a new market player, the module manufacturer, might join the market. It is hy-
pothesized that the module supplier will probably not evolve out of one of the existing 
players, mainly due to lack of know-how, capacities and intellectual protection issues. 
Instead new companies might take over this part and become competitors to conven-
tional plant engineering companies. The operator receives the possibility to choose 
whether he wants to serve the market operating large-scale plants or container mod-
ules. The decision depends on the specifications of the product the operating company 
wants to sell. If the operator decides to use modular production concepts the company 
will be confronted with new business models. A shift towards providers’ responsibili-
ties and risk taking can be identified in this relationship. This is because the modular 
production concept requires different services in order to be attractive for operators. 
The module manufacturer takes care of the plant over the entire life-cycle. Services 
such as remote control, apparatuses substitution or moving modules to different loca-
tions will emerge and will be necessary in order to gain the full potential of modular 
chemical plants.

Abstract. The growing demand for integrated solutions forces manufacturers of 
industrial goods to combine their products with service components to Product-
Service Systems, or Extended Products (EP). The new value proposition of the 
EP and the required network of business partners are not included in the tradi-
tional business models of manufacturing companies. A business model 
represents the implementation of an industrial strategy in respect to its specific 
elements. The purpose of this paper is to investigate classic strategies in manu-
facturing and new strategic approaches to help manufacturers transform their 
business models for EP. A special focus is given to value innovation and colla-
boration in Manufacturing Service Ecosystems (MSE). In an MSE, different or-
ganizations and individuals can work together with common or complementary 
objectives on new value added combinations of manufactured products and 
product-related services. The approach is exemplified by the transformation of 
the business model of a machine tool manufacturer.

Introduction 
The European manufacturing industry is currently in recession. Although Germany is 
still very successfully exporting goods and services, most of the other European coun-
tries see their industries declining. One potential way out of this critical situation 
might be the creation and operation of service ecosystems as an extension to the exist-
ing industrial districts. The paradigm shift towards a service dominant logic [1] is 
simple: Customers are more and more looking for solutions and benefits. In an at-
tempt to understand and answer the customers’ problems, manufacturers of industrial 
goods are increasingly adding services to their products to create holistic and individ-
ual solutions. While in the beginning the physical product has just been extended with 
some basic services, the value share of services is now increasing to parity with the 
product and beyond. Such an offering of complementary product and service compo-
nents is viewed as a Product-Service System, or Extended Product (EP) [2]. 

240 
S. Wiesner et al. 
 
However, this servitization of manufacturing from physical products to EP also  
requires innovation of business models [3]. Of course, the value proposition of the  
Extended Product to the customer has to be described. But furthermore a new infrastruc-
ture of business partners is needed, providing the right competencies and resources for 
realization of the value proposition. Also, new revenue streams have to be defined. 
While in the past revenue has been generated from selling the product, now additional 
types of revenue streams can be distinguished: In a function-oriented business model, 
the functionality of the solution is secured, e.g. through maintenance services. Availa-
bility-oriented business models additionally guarantee the usability of the solution. 
Finally, result-oriented business models sell only the benefits of the solution to the 
customer, while the responsibility for its operation remains with the provider [4]. 
A business model can be seen as an implementation of an industrial strategy in re-
spect to the specific elements of the business model. Thus, the innovation of business 
models does require an investigation of the underlying strategic approaches. The pa-
per will first present a theoretical background on the chosen business model definition 
and elements. The relationship between industrial strategy and business model is de-
scribed. Following, classic strategies in manufacturing are identified and exemplified 
by the traditional business model of a machine tool manufacturer. On this basis, a new 
strategy of value innovation and collaboration in Manufacturing Service Ecosystems 
(MSE) is described, which has been developed in the European integrated project 
“Manufacturing SErvice Ecosystem” (MSEE) [5]. In this non-hierarchical form of 
collaboration, different organizations and individuals work together with common or 
complementary objectives on new value added combinations of manufactured prod-
ucts and product-related services. The example of the machine tool manufacturer is 
again used to show the transformation of the business model according to the new 
strategy.

Theoretical Background on Business Models 
The following sections give a short overview on the definition of a business model, 
which is used in this paper and the relationship between industrial strategy and busi-
ness model. 
2.1 
Definition of a Business Model 
The origin of the term business model is still not settled [6] and is either assigned the 
1950ies by Peter Drucker (using the term ‘logic of business’) or in the beginning of 
the 1970ties when the fields of information systems grew. There is a great amount of 
definitions and descriptions of business models, especially around the year 2000. 
They are either very short like the one from Baatz [7], who said this is the way “how 
to create money” or more sophisticated like the one from Rentmeister and Klein [8]: 
“A business model is an abstract model that depicts the relevant and essential aspects 
of a business in an aggregated and clear form. The model is used by the business to 
check and rank ideas and concepts. Business models concentrate on the decision 
makers and potential investors, and also employees and clients. A business model 

Strategies for Extended Product Business Models in Manufacturing Service Ecosystems 
241 
 
should depict the performance and information stream of the business and consider 
other involved actors.” Timmers [9] specifies: “An architecture for the product, ser-
vice and information flows, including a description of the various business actors and 
their roles; and a description of the potential benefits for the various business actors; 
and a description of the sources of revenues.” 
However, the above definitions are too vague to be applied in this paper. To ana-
lyze the impact of different industrial strategies to a business model, a concrete de-
scription of its elements is needed. Such a classification is offered by the Business 
Model Canvas as an approach for illustrating the building blocks of a business model 
[10]. The Business Model Canvas is a template that is often used within strategic 
management and offers the idea to describe how an organization creates, delivers and 
captures value. It divides a business model into four pillars with altogether nine build-
ing blocks that are intended to realize that claim. The pillars and building blocks of 
the Business Model Canvas are: 
• Value proposition of the offering to the customer 
• Customers 
─ Customer Segments 
─ Channels of delivery 
─ Customer Relationship 
• Infrastructure 
─ Key Activities 
─ Key Resources 
─ Partner Network 
• Finances 
─ Cost Structure 
─ Revenue Streams 
The application of the Business Model Canvas, especially the nine building blocks, 
will deliver a holistic view on the changes new industrial strategies inflict on a busi-
ness model. It will be used in the following chapter to describe the traditional business 
model of a machine tool manufacturer and in chapter 5 to give a hint on a new EP 
business model. 
2.2 
Relationship between Strategy and Business Model 
Often the terms business model and strategy are mixed and put in different orders. 
Anyhow most of the management researchers agree that both are different concepts 
affecting different conceptual levels. Here we follow Bieger et.al. [6] stating that 
strategy gives the framework for the development and the design of a business model. 
In general, a company deduces strategies out of its corporate vision or mission, and 
establishes within the frame of these strategies an appropriate business model. 
According to Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart [11], a strategy is a context specific 
plan that serves to reach goals. The given frame or limitations to reach the goals are 
the ‘raw material’ to create business models. The determination of a business model is 
part of the strategic process in order to reach the goals and so a business model is a 
reflection of a companies’ realized strategy (see Fig. 1).

reached by high capacities (economies of scale) and a strict view on cost aspects. 
Using this kind of strategy means to become the lowest cost producer in your industry 
or business. This kind is often used with large-scale businesses providing standard 
products with little differentiation and which are accepted by most of the clients. 
Differentiation in contrast means to create a unique product or products with 
unique attributes (support etc.), that are perceived by the customers. It is often used 
with asking for a higher or even premium price, like brands do. Different options 
allow following this way, like superior product quality, branding, industry-wide dis-
tribution across all major channels and consistent promotional support. 
Most companies will choose a path between these two extremes of cost leadership 
and differentiation. They might focus their concentration on a restricted number of 
market segments. An example of a business model derived from the Porter strategies 
is presented in the next section. 
3.2 
Classic Business Models in Manufacturing 
From the Porter strategies a blueprint of a classic business model in manufacturing 
can be created. In order to complement the theoretical approach, a survey under 
MSEE end-users has been conducted, taking up a Business Model Canvas of the part-
ners. The canvas of one of the end-users is shown below (see Fig. 2):

break the boundaries of the manufacturing industry by adding services to the product 
are marked in dark grey. The separate building blocks characterizing a “classic” busi-
ness model can be described as follows: 
• Value proposition 
 
The value proposition to the customer are the functionalities the customized ma-
chine tool and to a certain extent training on its operation. 
• Customers 
─ Customer Segments  
Individual companies as customers in different size categories (differentiation). 
─ Channels of distribution 
 
Physical visits of the selling department. 
─ Customer Relationship 
 
Typically a buyer-seller relationship, sometimes long-term “friendship”. 
• Infrastructure 
─ Key Activities 
 
Manufacturing and assembly of the machine. 
─ Key Resources 
 
Design and manufacturing departments. 
─ Partner Network 
 
Suppliers of machine parts as well as training and research centers. 
• Finances 
─ Cost Structure 
 
Cost-driven for design, manufacturing and logistics. 
─ Revenue Streams 
 
Most of the revenue comes from the sale of the product and basic maintenance.

New Strategic Approach in Manufacturing 
Formerly, the boundaries of the manufacturing industry and its market space were 
defined and accepted. However, improved productivity generated through new tech-
nologies has led to a surplus of supply, while demand remains static. Furthermore, 
decreasing trade and information barriers increase the competition, leading to com-
moditization of products and shrinking profits. A new strategic approach is needed for 
manufacturing companies to sustain high performance, which is presented in the fol-
lowing sections. 
4.1 
Value Innovation through Extended Products 
The classic approaches of cost leadership and differentiation are called the Red Ocean 
Strategy, as cutthroat competition turns the “ocean” of known market space red. As a 
solution, the creation of untapped market space with new demand and profitable 
growth through a Blue Ocean Strategy is proposed [14]. While the classic approaches 

Strategies for Extended Product Business Models in Manufacturing Service Ecosystems 
245 
 
call for a trade-off between differentiation and low cost to exploit existing demand, 
the creation of new demand in blue oceans breaks this value-cost trade-off. 
An analysis of strategic moves has shown that blue oceans are formed by creating a 
leap in value for the company and their customers. This process is termed value inno-
vation, in contrast to incremental value creation and purely technological innovation. 
Value innovation means to pursue differentiation and low cost at the same time: 
“Value innovation is created in the region where a company’s actions favorably af-
fect both its cost structure and its value proposition to buyers. Cost savings are made 
by eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on. Buyer value is lifted 
by raising and creating elements the industry has never offered. Over time, costs are 
reduced further as scale economies kick in due to the high sales volumes that superior 
value generates.” [14] 
Value innovation thus denotes a strategic element that concentrates on the value 
proposition to potential buyers. For manufacturing enterprises, this means to concen-
trate their strategy on innovating new value propositions for their customers to make 
competition of other companies irrelevant. The leap in value has to be achieved by 
breaking the boundaries of the manufacturing industry and creating a new offering 
that is hard to copy. At the same time, the key factors of manufacturing have to be 
improved and complemented with non-manufacturing factors from other industries. 
The bundling of physical products with intangible components like services creates 
new options for value innovation, where the manufactured product is combined with 
services from other domains to an Extended Product, giving more value to the cus-
tomer [2]. The Extended Product concept is illustrated in Fig. 3. 
 
Fig. 3. Extended Product concept 
The above figure shows the logic of the Extended Product concept, where the 
physical product in the center is surrounded by its shell (innermost ring) and different 
kinds of services (outer rings). While the product shell denotes tangible aspects like 
packaging, design etc., the services describe intangible additions to the product. 

246 
S. Wiesner et al. 
 
Aligned services are developed together with the physical product and are thus espe-
cially designed to be used with it (e.g. maintenance plans). Another possibility are 
standard services that are available on the market (e.g. logistics services), for which 
the physical product has to be equipped with a compatible interface. Finally, there 
may be universal services (e.g. remote monitoring), where the service itself is mod-
ified with an interface to work with the physical product. 
The different options to configure Extended Products do also create a number of 
possibilities for value innovation. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the 
possible value propositions of Extended Products in more detail: 
• New combinations of existing products with existing services 
 
Value may be innovated by recombining already existing products and services, 
maybe even from different domains. An example for this approach is the combina-
tion of the existing product bicycle with express mail service to bike couriers. 
• New services for existing products 
 
If the product is already existing, the option might be to develop or adapt a new 
universal service with a service-product interface. A new remote monitoring ser-
vice using the already existing sensors of a machine tool is an example for this ap-
proach. 
• New products for existing services 
 
Another option for value innovation is to concentrate on already existing standard 
services and develop or adapt a product with a product-service interface. A fitting 
example is smart phones, integrating existing services from different domains like 
telephony, localization and internet. 
• Combinations of new products with new services 
 
In this case, the products as well as the services are newly developed in an integra-
tive approach. The integrated Apple approach of the iPod music player and the cor-
responding iTunes service can serve as an example for this. 
4.2 
Collaboration in Manufacturing Service Ecosystems 
As value innovation typically requires breaking the boundaries of the industry, value 
itself has to be defined beyond the boundary of a particular company. It rather extends 
to other stakeholders involved and is not an isolated issue for individual companies. 
The innovation of Extended Products also requires additional competencies. New 
combinations of products and services require looking into branches which are not yet 
related to the product to discover opportunities. The development of services requires 
competencies in service engineering and in all cases it could be necessary to have 
competencies in developing product-service and service-product interfaces. These 
competencies could come from collaboration with service providers. 
Therefore, collaboration is an important factor to be considered when defining new 
business models for Extended Products. To support collaboration for value innova-
tion, companies have to be enabled to “work together”. In previous papers, the Manu-
facturing Service Ecosystem (MSE) has been described as a suitable model to support 
the innovation of Extended Products: “The MSE is a non-hierarchical form of  

Strategies for Extended Product Business Models in Manufacturing Service Ecosystems 
247 
 
collaboration where various different organizations and individuals work together 
with common or complementary objectives on new value added combinations of man-
ufactured products and product-related services. This includes the promotion, the 
development and the provision of new ideas, new products, new processes or new 
markets. Future Internet architectures and platforms enable the active participation 
of all stakeholders in all the phases of the product and service life cycle.” [15] 
 
Fig. 4. The Manufacturing Service Ecosystem 
Value Innovation is supported through the formation of a Virtual Manufacturing 
Enterprise (VME) structure, which is shown by the connection lines. The broad varie-
ty of the ecosystem supports the “look beyond the own backyard”. Thus, an EP of 
interoperable products and services can be configured through the MSE members. 
Being based on Future Internet architecture and platforms, MSE business models 
are heavily depending on drivers from this area. The FInES Cluster has recognized 
four major drivers for new business models [16]: 
• Web 2.0 developments 
• ICT market trends towards commoditization and utility 
• New Key Enabling Technologies (KET) 
• Globalization 
Web 2.0 encompasses a range of services that are Internet based and involve the  
direct participation of end-users. As such, they capture new demand and create an 
ecosystem of relationships between business partners from different domains and the 
customer. Also, revenue is disconnected from selling a product towards service provi-
sion. Therefore Web 2.0 is an important enabler for value innovation. 
Commoditization of ICT and interoperability as a utility support more high value 
added capabilities through online and real-time services. Standard basic tools from 
different platforms can be combined for co-creation of value based on the needs of the 
end-user. The relationship between suppliers and customers becomes more important 
than mere production. New business models have to balance the value between the 
provider and the customer.

S. Wiesner et al. 
 
As commoditization of existing technologies is on its way, the development of new 
Key Enabling Technologies for Enterprise Interoperability is critical for the success of 
new business models. Important aspects are e.g. Service oriented Architecture, busi-
ness relations or enterprise modelling. A bottom-up approach of open, modular build-
ing blocks enables dynamic service creation, execution, discovery, composition and 
orchestration. 
Finally, the broadly used term of globalization is also relevant for the development 
of new business models. Production is internationally distributed among specialized 
partners. This increasingly affects also the service business, enabled by ICT. This 
leads to new opportunities, but also to challenges for innovation. Dynamic business 
models are essential to respond quickly to changes. However, evolving value net-
works and ecosystems need new enterprise systems to manage them.

Extended Product Business Models 
By mapping the new strategic approach of value innovation through EP by collabora-
tion in MSE to the nine building blocks of the Business Model Canvas, ideas for new 
business models can be derived. Taking the recorded business models of the MSEE 
end-users as a basis, a transformation of these models towards EP and MSE has been 
conducted. In the following, the effects on the building blocks from Extended Prod-
ucts and Manufacturing Service Ecosystems are described according to the example 
from the machine tool manufacturer (see Fig. 5):

In the figure above, the similarities to the classic business model are marked black 
and dark grey, while changes based on the EP and MSE strategy are marked in light 
gray. The separate building blocks can be described as follows: 
• Value Proposition 
 
The value proposition is the guaranteed availability of the machine tool.  
• Customers 
─ Customer Segments  
The customers addressed remain mainly unchanged, but new geographical areas 
can be targeted thanks to new business partner in the ecosystem. 
─ Channels 
Recalling the growing importance of ICT and networking, new maintenance 
services will be delivered in real-time on-line. 
─ Customer Relationship 
 
While selling is more or less a one-time activity, the new business model focus-
es on permanent interaction with the customer on the basis of a maintenance 
contract. 
• Infrastructure 
─ Key Activities 
 
Besides the production of the machine, remote monitoring of its health status is 
one of the main activities. 
─ Key Resources 
 
To develop and implement the maintenance services, a IT department is a main 
resource. 
─ Partner Network 
 
The partner network is extended to an ecosystem of local maintenance partners, 
who are able to repair a broken machine in a minimum of time. 
• Finances 
─ Cost Structure 
 
The maintenance activities are subcontracted to the local maintenance partners. 
─ Revenue Streams 
 
The goal is to generate a constant revenue stream through the availability con-
tract and machine upgrades.

Conclusion 
This paper has analyzed the challenges to the classic business models in manufactur-
ing, which are based on the strategies of cost leadership and differentiation. Using the 
Business Model Canvas, the effects of these strategies to the building blocks of a 
business model example from the machine tool sector have been illustrated. Extended 
Products and the Manufacturing Service Ecosystem are introduced as a new strategic 
approach for value innovation in manufacturing. A first analysis has shown how the 
building blocks of the Business Model Canvas for the machine tool example could be 
adapted to this new strategy. This preliminary analysis will be detailed in subsequent 
work and the results will be evaluated through implementation in the business cases 
of the end-users from the MSEE project.

Abstract. The paper explores business model elements that are vital when of-
fering customers Functional Products. Based on in-depth empirical studies at 
four manufacturing corporations, a number of Functional Product business 
model elements are identified and discussed. The identified business model 
elements for Functional Products are found to have special requirements as 
compared to well-established generic business models. The results, including 
both academic and industrial contributions, can be used by corporations as input 
when modeling Functional Product business models on their own or together 
with customers, business partners or suppliers. Finally, factors and challenges 
that need to be addressed when modelling Functional Product business in cor-
porations are further discussed.

(FP), Product-Service System (PSS).

Introduction 
This explorative paper concerns elements that constitute a Functional Product (FP) 
business model. To facilitate successful development, marketing, sales and operation 
of FPs, manufacturing corporations need to revise their business model(s). Most busi-
ness models aim to create value and sustainable competitive advantage in a defined 
market, and Chesbrough [1] posits that the choice of business model is crucial as “a 
mediocre technology pursued within a great business model may be more valuable 
that a great technology exploited via a mediocre business model” (p355). Thus, barri-
ers to business model innovation, such as conflicts with existing assets and business 
models, understanding of these barriers, process of experimentation and effectuation, 
successful leadership of organizational change, etc., must be brought up and dealt 
with if they are to be overcome [1]. Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart [2] stress the need 
to understand how to innovate business models to improve the ability to create and 
capture value. Understanding the creation and capturing of value, i.e. how different 
inter-connected business model elements form the business logic or architecture re-
quired to do this, probably aids understanding of what is otherwise needed for a  
successful business model.

Based on empirical data from four manufacturing corporations involved in FP in-
novation and research, our initial findings pertaining to FP business model elements 
are presented. The proposed set of business model elements can be used by corpora-
tions as input while modeling their own FP business models and customer offerings. 
An FP1 comprises integrated developed hardware, software, a service support system 
and management of operation [10]. The software component grows as the require-
ments for monitoring, remote management and maintenance, as well as software up-
gradability become further sophisticated [11, 12]. The software is often integrated 
with the hardware and service support system and, depending on type of FP, can also 
be seen as a stand-alone entity providing its own value to the delivery of the function. 
The service support system is needed to keep the hardware and software operable, and 
the triad is combined to provide a complete function to customers [5, 13]. Alonso-
Rasgado et al. [5] add that the service support system is much more than maintenance, 
often including decision-making, operations planning, remanufacture and education. 
Throughout the FP lifecycle, operation of the FP must be managed and  
developed [10]. 
Among many corporations, there is an increased interest in using the FP business 
model for transforming and selling products, services or combinations of products and 
services as FPs or parts of FPs. Moving into FP provision with a specified availability 
level requires identification of a future win-win situation with the customer, since the 
ownership of the FP is foreseen to remain with the provider/consortium providing the 
function. In line with Löfstrand et al. [14], Tan and McAloone [15] suggest that two 
lifecycle systems, i.e. the physical artefact and the activities in the relation in between 
the provider and customer, need to be considered. This challenge affects the FP  
business model, the planning of the FP lifecycle and its development, since the devel-
opment is more complex than developing a product with services. Therefore, corpora-
tions need to further advance their understanding of FP business model elements and 
development to be able to critically craft such business models. 
Prior research in the strategic management and management information systems 
domains, e.g. [16, 17, 18, 19], has highlighted generic business model elements. 
However, currently there is a lack of tangible research on the FP or closely related 
business models’ elements (besides [20, 21, 22]). Focusing on business model ele-
ments in the context of FP, business development is important because the path 
through which corporations create value can differ significantly from prior knowledge 
gained from generic business modeling. Therefore, in this paper we aim to identify 
and propose a set of critical business model elements based on analysis of FP business 
model development in four corporations. 
                                                           
1  The concept of FP has similarities with, for instance, Functional Sales [3], Extended Products 
[4], Total Care Product [5], Product-Service System (PSS) and Industrial Product-Service 
Systems (IPS2) [6], Servitization [7], or Service Engineering [8] in the sense of increasing the 
focus on soft parts such as services, knowledge and know-how etc., additionally offered. 
Tukker and Tischner [9] have identified three main PSS categories: product-oriented, use-
oriented and result-oriented. The FP, originating from hardware aspects, has most commonal-
ities with PSS/IPS2, Total Care Products and Functional Sales, however adding additional 
complexity development-wise.

Research Approach 
The research approach employed in this study has been based on in-depth empirical 
studies at four manufacturing corporations. The empirical studies were conducted 
using semi-structured open-ended interviews [23, 24] with fourteen respondents 
working for corporations active in the Faste Laboratory at Luleå University of Tech-
nology, Sweden, which is a VINNOVA2 Excellence Centre concerned with FP Inno-
vation. Thus, the respondents were well aware of and knowledgeable regarding FPs. 
The respondents were professionals responsible for marketing, services, research 
coordination, development and sales, at three global international corporations and 
one small Swedish-based corporation:  
1. International manufacturing corporation (five respondents – marketing specialist, 
services specialist, responsible portal development, project leader research, 
research coordinator) 
2. Hägglunds Drives Bosch Rexroth (three respondents – director services, manager 
design R&D motors, and manager development control systems) 
3. Volvo CE (three respondents – R&D chief project manager, service marketing 
manager, advanced engineering engineer) 
4. Infrafone AB (three respondents – founder, Director Engineering, and CEO) 
The purpose of having multiple corporations with diverse focus was to ensure an ad-
vance in the understanding of how the FP business model and its elements can be 
embodied at a mainly strategic business unit level, considering the similarities and 
differences between the corporations [cf. 25]. Although the corporations have differ-
ent offerings, they all face the common challenge of how to best develop, market, sell 
and operate FPs and/or similar concepts such as PSS/IPS2, either as a provider in a 
partner consortium or as part of their own offerings. The corporations are all manu-
facturing corporations with roots in hardware development. However, additional 
components have been added to their customer offerings. What the additional compo-
nents comprise and their weight or importance differs depending on industry and 
customer segments served. Some of the corporations aim to increase their revenue 
from soft parts, e.g. services, knowledge or know-how, as well as functions sold glob-
ally. The FPs planned or currently offered by the corporations differ and have differ-
ing emphasis on the composition of hardware, software, service support system and 
management of operation. 
Initially, semi-structured interviews were used, with open questions [23, 24] allow-
ing the respondents to give detailed answers and add extra information where deemed 
necessary [26]. The data collected were displayed using a projector during the inter-
views, allowing the respondents to immediately read and accept the collected data. 
The collected data were displayed and analysed using a matrix [27]. The analysed 
data were used to compile a table comprising elements that may be included in the FP 
business model and the number of corporations considering each element as part of 
their view of the FP business model (see Table 2 in section 4). For reasons of

confidentiality, only an aggregated view of the analysis is presented (and thus the 
individual corporations’ FP business model elements are not presented).

Towards Functional Product Business Model Elements 
Teece [18] asserts that the essence of a business model is how an enterprise delivers 
value to customers, what makes the customers pay for value, and how profit is made. 
Further, Teece [18] adds that when an enterprise is incepted, it implicitly or explicitly 
uses a business model describing the architecture for value creation, delivery and 
capture mechanisms used. A question raised by Teece [18] is how to build a sustain-
able competitive advantage with profit or super profit. The answer, according to 
Teece [18], is to not only excel at product innovation, but also at business model in-
novation, and understanding of customers and business design options. Thus, for an 
enterprise with a product development focus, business modeling and understanding of 
business models are necessary together with tight interaction with customers. 
Business modeling is gaining more and more interest both in industry as well in 
academy, and business modeling concerning products, services and products com-
bined with services have been well discussed by researchers, e.g. [28, 29]. However, 
for business models comprising additional complexity, such as: PSS, IPS2, Functional 
sales or FP, there is still a lack of basic as well as specific research. To shed additional 
light on business models, the following sub-section highlights established/recent re-
search on generic business models, and another sub-section concerns state-of-art in 
FP and closely related business models. Table 1 comprises a condensation of the 
business model elements found. 
3.1 
Generic Business Models 
Recent research [17, 18, 19] indicates an interest in generic business models and what 
elements the generic business models comprise. Below, one established and three 
recently developed generic business models are defined by their elements (see further 
Table 1): 
• 
Johansson et al. [16]: 1) Customer value proposition, 2) Profit formula (revenue 
model, cost structure, margin model resources velocity), 3) Key processes 
(processes, rules & metrics, norms) and, 4) Key resources (people, technology & 
products, equipment, information, channels, partnerships & alliances, brand). 
• 
Osterwalder and Pigneur [17]: 1) Customer segments, 2) Value proposition, 3) 
Channels, 4) Customer relationship, 5) Revenue streams, 6) Key resources, 7) 
Key activities, 8) Key partnerships and, 9) Cost structure. 
• 
Teece [18]: 1) Target segment, 2) Customer value, 3) Revenue stream, 4) Capture 
value and, 5) Technology selection. 
•

Functional Products and Closely Related Business Models 
There is a lack of tangible research published on the FP and closely related business 
models and their respective elements. Schuh et al. [20], Meier et al. [21] and Kind-
ström [22] provide through their proposed elements some further guidance (see Table 
1). However, further empirical research is deemed necessary to specify the business 
models and their elements with an additional level of detail.

4) Development/production process 
•

Product Models (processes, recourses, partners) and, 4) Turnover model 
• 
Kindström [22]: 1) Value proposition, Revenue mechanism, 3) Value chain, 4) 
Value network, 5) Competitive strategy and, 6) Target market 
Table 1 provides a structure (which will partly be used in Table 2) and can give ideas 
to discussions pertaining to existing or new business related to FPs as well as similar 
business models.

FP business model elements and, for each element, how many corporations (out of 4) 
favor these. The elements are further described below based on the data collected. 
Further, an analysis of why the composition of elements looks like it does follows at 
the end of this section. 
4.1 
Descriptions of the Elements 
Below are descriptions for each of the elements found in Table 2. The descriptions are 
based on the empirical data collected and analyzed. 
 
# 1. Quality of external relations – in the distribution channel between the FP pro-
vider, suppliers, partners, distributors, and end-customers. Properties seen as im-
portant for the relation are: 
 
o 
Relation distributor/dealer to end-customer should be needs-oriented fo-
cusing to learn and analyze the customer’s process/needs.  
o 
Having a global presence is important to attract some customers. Impor-
tant as well for partners/customers requiring closeness to expertise. 
o 
Identification of present and future win-win situation in between provid-
er, partners and customer is essential for establishing trustful long-term 
relationships. 
o 
The customer needs to be able to trust the provider of an FP, and the 
provider must also be able to trust the customer in terms of acting res-
ponsibly (in line with the operational parameters stated in the contract). 
o 
An ability to reference existing customers is a further indication of a 
strong relation. 
o 
Partners are important to provide, e.g. onsite support and installations, as 
well as act together with the provider in the distribution channel to build 
a complete FP offer. Examples of additional services provided by spe-
cialists are financial services and specialized consulting/advisory  
services.  
# 2. Brand and value chain position 
o 
Brand is important or vital. The brand is particularly important if the 
provider does not have close or any end-customer interactions. 
o 
Being positioned as a market leader enables increased sales. 
o 
An FP provider needs to be situated as high (upstream) as possible in the 
value chain, as being situated low makes it hard to develop FP business. 
# 3. In-house organization 
o 
Change management and business training are required inside of provid-
er organizations to change organizations accustomed to selling products, 
services, etc. into offering FP, e.g. referring to: top level management 
mindset and courage relating to FP, more complex business models, or-
ganizational readiness for FP and related development processes, deci-
sion impacts from FP business, need for patience and long-term think-
ing, and need for internal communication between adequate decision  
levels to create unity.

Table 2. FP Business Model Elements 
 
 
o 
Sales strategy and modeling – additional business models with higher 
complexity requires careful modeling and strategic thinking. New cus-
tomer segmentation models may be required, as well as improved under-
standing of customer processes. Need to consider how to organize for 
selling a mix of products, services and solutions/total offers/FPs, etc. – 
as new business models in addition can introduce or cause changes in 
the power balance among the parties involved. 
o 
FP sales require upstream and downstream thinking in the value chains. 
# 4. Risk level and availability 
o 
Availability – need to adapt towards selling an FP with a specified/ 
agreed upon availability level. Of great importance for the customer. 
o 
Risk management – need to balance availability versus cost, where pro-
viders need to take a greater long-term responsibility built on trustful re-
lations. Risk modeling, risk mitigation strategies (such as insurance 
modeling), revenue modeling on long-term basis, and cost/revenue shar-
ing models need to be developed. 
# 5. Customer involvement and commitment 
o 
FP requires more from customers, e.g. increased maturity, ability to spe-
cify needs/wants as functions rather than as technical specifications. 
o 
Customer behavior – the customers need to apply changes needed ac-
cording to business model requirements - such as customer buying be-
havior and operational behavior (i.e. to ensure operation within specified 
parameters). 
# 6. Customer value and value carrier  
o 
Customer value - what is considered as value by the customers? What 
generates the customer value? Is the value perceived differently by dif-
ferent customer segments? Need to segment the customers according to 
value perceived.

o 
Value carriers need to be clear to set prices and profitability targets. 
o 
Customer value record – what have the customers achieved over time? 
o 
Measurement of customer value using KPIs such as: achieved productiv-
ity/total cost, productivity increase, savings, and customer satisfaction.  
# 7. Competence/know-how and relevant information for decision-making 
o 
Soft items: problems/solutions, training, development of standards, 
knowledge/know-how, etc. must be available where/when needed to be 
given and retrieved back from customers/partners. 
o 
Providers need to increase knowledge on product/services/FP properties 
and how these are used in customer processes, i.e. need to learn more on 
targeted customer processes to understand open opportunities. 
o 
Distributors and dealers need to increase knowledge on soft items and 
improve service capability. 
o 
Information transparency/adequacy - adequate information for decision-
making at different levels of control is needed. 
o 
Business management needs to increase focus on competence/knowhow 
and information adequacy. KPIs should be implemented for follow-up 
on business management level. 
o 
Requirement for project-oriented sales.  
# 8. Contract – what has been agreed upon between the main provider towards part-
ners/distributors/suppliers/customers, etc. within the value chain? 
o 
What is promised and agreed upon from both ends – what is paid for? 
o 
Different types of contracts are required towards customers, partners, 
suppliers, financial partners, etc. 
# 9. Recipe for profitability and financial sustainability – sound financial calcula-
tions (if possible, together with the value chain) are needed to create a stable and 
sustainable situation for the provider, customer and the rest of the value chain 
over time. Important aspects, but profitability, capital and operational expendi-
tures are also required for the parties involved. Transparency among those in-
volved allows for strong long-term relations, as all or most are kept content. 
In Table 2 the elements of a business model for FPs are highlighted and summarized. 
When comparing the proposed elements in Table 2 with the elements of conventional 
business models (see Table 1) it becomes obvious that FP development requires high-
ly developed relations with customers and partners, and that a thorough strategy for 
risk management is needed. The management of the risk level can be seen as an 
integrator for the FP business model, and spans the closely related elements #1 (i.e. 
building and maintaining trust), #4 (i.e. risks related to cost versus availability ratio) 
and #9 (i.e. profitability and sustainability over time). Further, management of the risk 
level pertains to all corporations interviewed, albeit by somewhat different but closely 
related means, which is logical, since an FP is provided with an agreed upon level of 
availability, often in combination with long-term contracts and expected long life-
cycles. While customer interaction has always been regarded as a success criterion, 
the development, marketing, sales and operation of FP offerings require an even bet-
ter understanding of customer needs and wants and of the processes creating value in 
the customers’ value chains. Consequently, this implies a need for new mindsets in

managing the corporation on different levels3, development of competence and know-
how, and a decision-making system that recognizes the partly new parameters and 
factors involved in FP business development. 
There are FP business model elements that are similar to the ones listed in Table 1, 
and it would be remarkable if all elements were different. However, the results con-
tain elements with content that is specific to FP contexts, such as elements #3, 4, 5 
and 7. Among other things, #7 provides information for decision-making to the other 
elements where such is required (see, e.g. [10, 11, 12, 14]). In all business models 
there are elements that assist in the creation and capturing of value. However, there 
are also elements that support one or more of the other elements in the crea-
tion/capturing of value. In the proposed set of FP business elements, elements #1, 2, 
3, 4, 6 and 7 are considered as creative or capturing, while elements #5, 8 and 9 in an 
FP context can be considered as more supportive rather than creative or capturing.  
As all corporations in the study target different industries and applications of FPs, 
it becomes clear that, for instance, corporate history/age/organization/size as well as 
target markets, geographical coverage, customer types and types of customer offer-
ings affect what business model elements are needed to sustain the business logic 
required to create/capture and deliver value to the customers and remain competitive.

Discussion and Conclusions 
The business model elements listed in Table 2 are described, adding specificity for the 
FP business model context as seen by four corporations. It is evident that FP business 
model elements which are not related to hardware and/or services grow in importance. 
This will be a challenge for corporations who have until now been focusing on busi-
ness models mainly involving hardware and/or services. Further, Table 2 provides a 
comprehensive set of nine FP business model elements to consider and select from, as 
it is not likely that all nine elements are required for all FP contexts. The set of ele-
ments constitutes a mix of creative or capturing as well as supportive elements, whe-
reof most affecting organizations are of a holistic character. Further, management of 
risk level is seen as the essential integrator for the FP business model - spanning at 
least three of the proposed elements. 
We see a number of business model challenges in line with Chesbrough [1], and a 
need for change and innovation [2] for corporations providing FPs - adding further 
complexity. Many of these challenges and changes pertain to: organizational age, 
history, habits, size and agility, existing customer offers, customer agility and re-
quirements for new development, customer base homogeneity/heterogeneity. The 
same goes for the business partners, distributors and suppliers that will be involved on 
the provider side. As pointed out in some of the business model elements in Table 2, 
the customers also need to adapt and consequently change their business to be able to 
get the full value and potential out of an FP. Otherwise, a win-win situation leading to 
sustainable competitive advantage and (super) profit [18] for all involved will not be 
achieved. Consequently, future research should explore the role and importance of FP 
business model elements.  
                                                           
3  While developing FP business models, decisions may involve both top management at corpo-
rate and strategic business unit levels. 

260 
J. Lindström et al.  
 
In addition, Chesbrough [1] posits that many corporations have more processes and 
a stronger sense of how to innovate technology than they do for business models and, 
further, that the choice of business model and overcoming related barriers are crucial. 
Thus, important too is the (top management) interest and ability to add new business 
models to an organization, which today performs well and sees no immediate need to 
change its business. A change to add one or more business models with additional 
complexity can be challenging, risky, daring and require new ways of thinking 
(among providers and customers) as well as organizational change and addition of 
competences and skills. However, as a provider should provide the customers with 
what they need – we foresee that most providers will continue to offer their existing 
business models and add new ones where suitable. Thus, a provider may not solely 
offer an FP to a customer, and the FP can be part of a large offer where products, 
services, hybrids of products and services, and FPs, are part of the whole solution. FP 
business can involve whole corporations or parts of them. Certainly, it is possible for 
a provider to use different FP business models. Further, Karlsson et al. [30] point out 
that being able to offer an FP can make the difference in closing a deal, and separate 
market leaders from followers. Therefore, development of FP business model(s) is 
essential for future success.

Abstract. In recent years there has been growing interest in utilizing a product-
service system (PSS) approach when developing products and services in order 
to arrive at a business model focused on selling function or availability instead 
of physical products. However, the complex nature of PSS development has left 
many manufacturers still struggling to arrive at PSS concepts out of their tradi-
tional product sales situation in early design phases. The purpose of this paper 
is to propose an approach using the Business Model Canvas which could help 
manufacturers in the transition towards PSS development by articulating key 
business elements in developing and analyzing PSS concepts evolving from 
their traditional product sales situation. The paper presents preliminary findings 
from the aerospace industry and discusses the evolution of key business ele-
ments for PSS concepts from traditional product sales situation using the Busi-
ness Model Canvas. Finally, the potential benefits of using the Business Model 
Canvas in a PSS context are discussed.

Introduction 
In recent years, many manufacturing firms are significantly generating major reve-
nues in offering both products and services [1]. Hence, there has been growing inter-
est in utilizing a product-service system (PSS) approach in developing products and 
services in order to arrive at a business model focused on selling function or availabil-
ity instead of the physical product. Although adding services to their portfolios is not 
new (e.g. Levitt was writing about services from manufacturers in the 1970’s [2]); 
what is relatively new is the shift from perceiving those services as a cost center to 
seeing them as part of a revenue-generating value proposition [3] [4]. Many research-
ers assert that PSS transition implies a major shift in the business operations, strategic 
thinking and management approaches that impacts the way products concepts are 
derived in the early phases [5] [6]. However, the complex nature of PSS development 
has left many manufacturers still struggling to design a PSS concept from their  

264 
J. Wallin, K. Chirumalla, and A. Thompson 
 
traditional sales situation in the earliest phases of product development [7]. Common 
approaches to product design have kept product and service aspects separate, thus 
when either the product or the service dominates in a combined offer, the correspond-
ing traditional product or service development approaches may be appropriate [8]. 
However, products and services that are tightly coupled must be designed in an inte-
grated way [9]. With an underlying shift from business based on value from exchange 
of product ownership and responsibility toward business based on value through utili-
ty of the products/services [10], a fundamental reassessment of the core business is 
often necessary [11]. 
A substantial number of methods for PSS design appear in the literature; see Clay-
ton et al. [8] for an evaluation of several of these methods as they relate to industrial 
practice. Clayton et al. [8] also note that there is some discrepancy regarding their 
case company’s “articulate value proposition” phase and corresponding phases in the 
literature (e.g. “business case” and “client and suppliers business cases”). This sug-
gests a need for a tool to support PSS-minded companies to identify and articulate the 
value proposition of the PSS they are designing.  
Current research on PSS provides little guidance regarding the development of new 
business models for companies in the transition towards PSS development. Kindström 
[5] e.g. provides some insight into moving toward a service-based business model for 
manufacturing firms, but gives only minimal attention to PSS. One recent tool for 
developing new business models is “The Business Model Canvas” (here after referred 
as “BMC” in the text) [12] that can be used to systematically understand, design and 
implement a new business models. The reasons for choosing BMC for this study is 
that BMC is an intuitive and easy-to-use tool, covering different elements that have 
been identified as critical for a successful business model, providing an initial vision 
for companies that like to move towards PSS by viewing the business from a holistic 
standpoint. There has been little research conducted on using BMC for PSS design 
(e.g. [13-15]). This paper aims to fill this gap by answering the following research 
question: How can the Business Model Canvas support a company in developing PSS 
concepts in the early phases of the transition towards PSS development? This paper 
therefore proposes an approach using the BMC, which could help manufacturers in 
the transition towards PSS development by articulating the key business elements in 
developing and analyzing the PSS concepts (i.e. service/use-oriented PSSs) from their 
traditional sales situation (i.e. product-oriented PSS).  
2 
Theoretical Framework 
2.1 
Product-Service System (PSS) 
In literature, researchers suggest different definitions and types of PSS based on their 
focus and perspective [1] [4] [8] [16]. For instance, Mont [17, p.71] defines PSS as: 
“…A system of products, services, supporting networks and infrastructure that is 
designed to be competitive, satisfy customer’s needs and have a lower environmental 
impact than traditional business models”. Tukker and Tischner [16] divide PSS con-
cepts into three main categories—product-oriented, use-oriented, and result-oriented. 
The type of value embedded in the business offering (mainly product- or  

 
Developing PSS Concepts from Traditional Product Sales Situation 
265 
 
service- related) is chosen as the main criterion for this classification. A product-
oriented PSS, in general, represents the traditional sale of a product embracing some 
additional services, such as maintenance, repair, warranty, upgrades, reuse and recy-
cling. Use-oriented PSS represents sale of the use or availability of a product to cus-
tomers in different forms (e.g. leasing or sharing), but with the producer retaining 
ownership. The final category, result-oriented PSS, represents the sale of the result, 
function or capability of a product to customers, while retaining the ownership of the 
product. Three main categories of PSS are further elaborated and classified as eight 
types of PSS: product related service, product related advice/consultancy, product 
lease, product renting/sharing, product pooling, pay-per service unit, activity man-
agement, and functional result—depending upon the way value is created and offered 
to the customers [16]. Based on the extensive empirical data on 10,028 firms from 25 
different countries, Neely [18] adds two new categories of PSS—integration-oriented 
and service-oriented—to the Tukker and Tischner classification. Integration-oriented 
PSS result when firms seek to add services by going downstream and vertically  
integrating (e.g. consulting services, financial services, retail and distribution, trans-
portation and trucking services and property and real estate services) whereas service-
oriented PSS result when firms incorporate services into the product itself (e.g.  
systems and solutions). Recently, Clayton et al. [8] present these five generic types of 
PSS within the product-service continuum to create a range of product-service offer-
ings (Figure 1). Both models [8] [16] emphasize the continuum of PSS, but leave little 
guidance on how a company can place themselves on this continuum from a tradition-
al situation.

Clayton et al [8] and Tukker and Tischner [16] 
2.2 
PSS in the Aerospace Industry 
In the aerospace industry today, each aircraft engine is an opportunity to supply a 
stream of spare parts at high margins. Therefore the engines are often sold at reduced 
prices and the engine developers instead profit from maintenance and supply of spare 
parts, which typically represent product-oriented PSS business models [1]. There are 

266 
J. Wallin, K. Chirumalla, and A. Thompson 
 
also service-oriented PSS, where the engine is sold together with e.g. a monitoring 
system that keeps track of engine usage [19] and use-oriented PSS where the functio-
nality of the engine is sold rather than the product itself, e.g. ‘Power by the hour’ or 
TotalCare® by Rolls Royce [20]. Commitment and availability is increasingly valued 
by the airlines, compared to the sale and purchase of the traditional product. Further, 
it is in the interest of the engine developer to control the risks that enable lowering 
ownership costs in order to enhance profitability for both parties [20]. 
2.3 
Business Modeling for PSS 
The shift towards a PSS offering alters the traditional view of value creation (e.g. [1], 
[16]). This triggers a transition from a ‘transaction-based’ to a ‘long-term relation-
ship-based’ business connection [22], which necessitates redesigning the existing 
contractual and implicit relations and re-allocating risks and revenue structures. As a 
consequence, the successful implementation of a PSS solution needs to identify the 
supporting business models in order to address the organizational changes and opera-
tional strategies [21]. In this context, the business models that are traditionally prod-
uct-based and short-term focused are not merely applicable [6]. A central virtue of the 
business model is that it takes into account different underlying business elements and 
puts them together to create a holistic and system-level picture of the business [12] 
[23]. Over the years, different authors have developed a number of business model 
frameworks with different underlying business elements. For instance, Chesbrough 
[24] uses six common business elements as a structuring and analytical framework-
namely, (1) articulate the value proposition, (2) identify a target market, (3) define the 
structure of the value chain required by the firm, (4) specify the revenue generation 
mechanism(s) for the firm, (5) describe the position of the firm within the value net-
work, and (6) formulate the competitive strategy. Related to the PSS context, Spring 
and Araujo [21] summarize the four common business elements, including: (1) a con-
cern with network structure; (2) a focus on how transactions are made; (3) revenue 
models and incentives, and (4) how providers’ capabilities are transferred or accessed 
– through products, services or combinations thereof. Kujala et al. [6] propose a ty-
pology of five solution-specific business models and suggest that business models in a 
PSS context should be analyzed at the level of individual solutions depending upon 
the maturity of customers, instead of only at the firm- or business unit-level. A recent 
work by Lee et al. [13] proposes a structured methodology for business model design 
for a PSS that consists of a design template with which companies can analyze their 
current business models or invent new ones in a systematic manner. The template 
defines strategies and protocols for all business elements, which represent basic build-
ing blocks of the business model.

The Business Model Canvas (BMC) 
In recent years business model innovation has become an important tool to organiza-
tions for rethinking their value creation process and identifying new ways of creating 
value for their customers and themselves (e.g. [6], [23]). The Business Model Canvas 

 
Developing PSS Concepts from Traditional Product Sales Situation 
267 
 
proposed by Osterwalder and Pigneur [12] is one such tool for describing, visualizing 
the existing business models or developing new ones in a shared language. The visual 
canvas describes the business model through nine basic business elements as shown 
in Table 1, which covers the four core areas of a business: customers, offer, infra-
structure, and financial viability. Table 1 summarizes the details of each business 
element. Barquet et al. [14] present the characteristics of business model elements 
according to the type of PSS (i.e. mainly [16] classification) using BMC. Kim et al. 
[15] elaborate the work of Lee et al. [13] and present a case analysis of PSS design 
using the category of the BMC together with strategies and protocols.

Methodology 
This paper is based on a case study with a company that is an engine component and 
subsystem developer in the aerospace industry with a strong focus on traditional 
product development and additional maintenance services. The company has recently 
been transforming towards a PSS provider. On the military business side where the 
company is an engine OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), it has come far in 
service integration to the product offers and provides complete product-service  

268 
J. Wallin, K. Chirumalla, and A. Thompson 
 
systems. On the commercial business side where the company is a component devel-
oper, which requires close collaboration with the OEM, the company has recently 
increased the solution-based offers. This collaboration with the OEMs is described as 
a risk and revenue sharing partnership, where the partners shares development cost, 
risk and revenue throughout the engine program, which it is not in a ordinary custom-
er-supplier relationship. Since the company is undergoing the transition towards PSS 
development, it is hence an ideal case for the purpose of this paper. Data has been 
collected through observations at the company and ten semi-structured interviews 
with stakeholders in PSS development and business development, which include en-
gineers, project managers, process owners, business developers, and company special-
ists, where some also have used the BMC in their work. The data has been analyzed 
using a pattern matching technique to find coinciding (and non-coinciding) patterns 
[25]. The BMC has been used to summarize the data, deriving the key business ele-
ments to the PSS concepts from the traditional product sales situation. Furthermore, 
BMC elements have been used as a guiding tool for interviews.

Business Model Canvas for PSS Concepts: Empirical 
Findings 
One of the main challenges to transition into PSS development is the creation of new 
business models. As a component developer the business case is dependent on the 
business case of the OEM. It is easier to imagine service integration in products as an 
OEM. Hence, methods to support PSS development are even more important for 
component developers: “We cannot control the market, only how we do things, how 
we would like to do business”, described an interviewee. The company uses the term 
“soft products” to describe their servitization journey. Soft products represent all 
products and services sold to a customer that enhance the customer’s experience and 
satisfaction other than the sale of new products, such as fleet management, product 
support and monitoring systems. While talking about his perception on PSS, one of 
the process owners said “I would like to see our expansion of the area in soft products 
in the perspective of services, related to more efficient collaboration /…/ That says it 
is not necessarily part of the product portfolio. But that is part of our brand. That 
says we are the most easy to work with”. 
Even though the company has developed traditional services such as maintenance 
and product support, the transition towards servitization has involved creation of 
software that tracks life consumption of the engine components, which was an un-
known area for the company and involved risks. One challenge with entering  
unknown business areas is seeing the potential of new opportunities. The Business 
Model Canvas, in this context, is used to understand the potential benefits and chal-
lenges of entering unknown business areas as well as exploring related business ele-
ments around the unknown business area. At the case company the BMC is not a 
well-known tool, but it has been used in some groups for business development and 
PSS development groups. The tool has been used both as a workshop tool, where the 
group has performed a brainstorm activity for each section, as well as by individuals  
 

 
Developing PSS Concepts from Traditional Product Sales Situation 
269 
 
building a business case. The following paragraphs discuss each element of the BMC 
in detail. From the empirical discussion, Table 2 summarizes the evolution of busi-
ness model elements for PSS concepts from the traditional product sales situation. 
 
Customer Segments: As an engine component developer, the main customer is the 
engine OEM. However, this collaboration can be described as a risk and revenue shar-
ing partnership rather than a customer-supplier relationship. In PSS development the 
company has the possibility to look further down the supply chain for potential cus-
tomers. “[The airlines] could be a customer. That scenario is also possible”. But 
reaching for customers segments further down the supply chain, such as aircraft man-
ufacturer or airlines would be strengthened if made in partnership with OEM. 
 
Value Proposition: In a traditional sales situation, value is primarily exchanged 
through the component itself. “It’s about making it clear what functions you are fulfil-
ling with the product”, described a specialist. Another interviewee described the orga-
nizational culture as adding value: “I think we are appreciated for our Swedish way, if 
we say something, that is the way it is, sincerity and loyalty”. One of the project in-
formants described the technology development as adding value: “What technology 
can we bring to the table?; that is our value, in addition to the product development”. 
It is the same thing with the add-on maintenance service. In PSS business models, the 
value of the component is related more to the component in context, i.e. the value of 
the whole system: “But the value the product generates is, of course, the same but we 
can add value in the form of services, since we are further into the process”. Value is 
added through add-on services for increased product functionality, reduced risk, in-
creased safety, and reduced cost. Being a partner and not only a supplier could be 
considered as a service since it involves e.g. the sharing of risk and perhaps other 
value-added activities: “We might be offering services today that we do not know that 
we are offering”. Another interviewee added “Service can also be the proactive way 
of living from [the company] side when we working with the OEMs regarding how we 
can improve our engineering support and how we can improve development methods 
in the prospective way of learning and feedback [those in] to the organization. That’s 
the service that comes back internally as well as together with the OEM”. 
 
Channels: The engine components are developed in close collaboration with the en-
gine OEM. And the engine programs are one of the main channels with the OEM 
customer. One interviewee commented on this close collaboration: "Our main distri-
bution channel considering our value proposition is through product development 
(PD) projects. We also have business contacts and other channels and yes they're 
important too, but I think if you talk about building value and being a cog in the 
wheel, the PD projects are the most important thing, since we have straight communi-
cation [in PD projects]". As the company transitions further along its PSS journey, 
other partnerships such as joint ventures could be possible in the future. 
 
Customer Relationships: The company has strong ties with the closest customers 
(engine OEM for products, airlines for services). There are also (perhaps weaker) ties 

270 
J. Wallin, K. Chirumalla, and A. Thompson 
 
to other stakeholders in the industry. In PSS development, relationships become even 
more important, especially with partners in extended collaborations. Ties are streng-
thened with both upstream and downstream actors who are affected by the PSS, in-
cluding aircraft manufacturer, process technology suppliers, service centers, engine 
OEMs partner companies, and engine OEM competitors (e.g. [22]). One experienced 
informant pointed out that, “We work collaboratively early, we want to be even earli-
er, of course, to have a better plan. Let’s say collaborating even earlier with the en-
gine OEMs, aircraft OEMs, and systems OEMs would enable us to be better prepared 
from a technology prospective but also time-wise”. 
 
Revenue Streams: In the engine programs, revenue comes from selling the engine 
and, perhaps more importantly, the selling of spare parts: “The company makes money 
on selling spare parts. If those revenues are decreased we are forced to think of other 
ways to make money”, described a project manager. But as a component developer the 
revenue streams are dependent on the business case of the OEM. “When the OEM 
sold ‘power by the hour’ to their customers, they had no incentives to sell spare parts 
anymore”, the same incentives are therefore needed in the whole value chain “every-
one would think of long product life, everyone would think of low lifecycle cost” said a 
project manager. In a PSS situation there is also a possibility to increase revenue 
through availability contracts and selling of licensees.  
 
Key Resources: In the traditional sales situation the key resources are related to the 
structure of product development and the supply chain; the competences and know-
ledge of the product; and the production. Including service aspects in the product 
design space elevates the need to integrate an extended set of new competencies from 
many actors within the network, i.e. cross-functional cooperation: “This business of 
system development, we have included many consultants” said one interviewee. 
Another interviewee added: “We simply had to bring in many consultants since there 
were no such resources at the company”. Some consultants later became employees 
in order to keep the competence within the organization. 
 
Key activities: In traditional concepts product and service development activities are 
distinct. In this case, key activities involve e.g. assigning the positions that are respon-
sible for development of the product. Key activities also involve infusing trust to the 
customer: “We need to infuse trust to create value for the customer, come up with 
ideas, be proactive, show how we work and develop our methods”. In PSS concepts 
the products and services are co-developed in an integrated way to reduce risks, in-
crease safety and reduce cost. The PSS concept can include activities such as calculat-
ing life consumption of the component and monitoring the environment where the 
product is used. PSS can also involve increased external collaboration: “We know our 
application. So it is all about going out there and trying to find those pieces of puzzle 
that you need. We need to go outside our door, because if you only sit in your little 
team internally… of course you could come up with the world’s best solution but the 
probability is quite low. If you constantly work with the world around you the proba-
bility is much greater,” described a project manager.

Key Partnerships: Key partners in traditional sales situations are the customer and sup-
pliers in the aerospace industry. The company also has close collaboration with acade-
mia: “We have a network of lots of customers that we work with, loads of suppliers that 
we interact with, a great number of universities and professors” described an intervie-
wee. In a PSS concept the partnerships may be even broader; here they can also include 
extended value chain actors as well as IT suppliers, e.g. because of the increased software 
development. However “To handle and channel data that is not in our value proposi-
tion” described an interviewee and therefore such a partner could be needed. “But to 
establish the system infrastructure, I think that's our value proposition”.

Cost Structure: Costs in the traditional sales situations include product development, 
production, material and costs for maintenance services. In PSS situations the cost 
structure is not much different, but there could be added cost related to e.g. ensuring 
uptime, assuming additional risks, software development and monitoring costs. One 
interviewee described the additional costs of a monitoring system: “When it is up and 
running then it's the infrastructure, servers and software, to keep it configured and 
updated so to speak”.

Discussion and Concluding Remarks 
With the unprecedented speed at which customers’ needs and behaviors are changing, 
a company’s ability to rapidly adapt or generate innovative business models is critical 
to success. This study found that Business Model Canvas is a promising tool—with 
their intuitive and easy-to-use nature—for the companies to rapidly analyze and dis-
cuss their traditional product sales situation according to the nine business elements, 
thereby deriving the PSS concepts in the early phases. By having a value proposition 
as a central position, BMC provides an overall view of “what” and “how” the busi-
ness would look like in the transition towards PSS development. Since PSS not only 
involves different organizational areas within the development organization but can 
also affect several organizational areas for the customer, this can challenge the mar-
keting of the system and increases the importance of visualizing the value proposition 
in the business model. One interviewee described this challenge: “The value is there. 
No doubt about that. The question is how to sell it … To be able to sell it [the PSS] 
you must find the economical buyer in each company, thus the person that can see the 
value. If you go through the traditional entrance, where you sell your product, per-
haps the purchasing organization, they might close the door in front of you”. 
The case company has realized the benefits of its PSS journey. As a company spe-
cialist put it: “I think that the servitization, that is a trend that will last”. However, the 
challenge for manufacturers is to “take a mental break” from their product when ex-
ploring how to develop a PSS. History and attachment to the product may make it 
difficult for the company to see radical innovation opportunities that may or may not 
require significant changes to their core product. The BMC, with its initial emphasis 
on the value proposition, may aid companies in taking that mental break from their 
product and get a “PSS mindset”. Furthermore, the BMC, through its structure, guides 
them in the next steps to help understand how to take the value proposition and build 
a business model around it, eventually linking back to the company’s core product 
while adding significant context to the value offered by the product. By providing a 
level of abstraction related to the various business elements through qualitative as-
sessment, the BMC can help the company’s strategic plan (i.e. by defining overall 
mission and strategic goals) on an individual solution level [6] at a conceptual phase 
even before commencing business operations. Additionally, the BMC is a visual tool 
that is easy to use by both individuals and groups. One user described it: “It is very 
fast. You get quickly into the business model. It is good to visualize the big picture, so 
to speak”. However, even though the users at the case company like it, one critical 
point was brought up by PSS developer: “It doesn’t bring up risks. But we added that, 
business risks”.  

 
Developing PSS Concepts from Traditional Product Sales Situation 
273 
 
This study suggests that the BMC is a promising tool to support modifying or 
creating new business models at a faster pace. But as a tool to support the transition 
towards PSS development, it needs to have a clearer focus on this change, and some 
modifications should therefore be added. First is the modification of questions in the 
BMC to emphasize a change in perspective and to widen the business scope. For ex-
ample, instead of only asking: What value do we deliver to the customer? and For 
whom are we creating value? We should also ask: Are there additional customer 
needs that we could be satisfying? and Who could be benefitting from the value we 
are creating? Second is the addition of business risks, since the transition towards 
PSS development involves taking new risks. This could either be done by adding a 
new element of Business Risks to the BMC or with additional risk questions in each of 
the nine existing business elements. For instance, the questions such as: What are our 
principal business risks in PSS transition? How do we integrate risks with the compa-
ny’s strategic direction? How effective is our process for managing risks? 
This study evaluated the use of the Business Model Canvas in developing PSS 
concepts especially with respect to manufacturing companies seeking to transition 
towards PSS. The paper provides the empirical basis in using BMC for an aerospace, 
business-to-business (B2B) context. This is especially important since the current PSS 
literature on BMC usage is mostly focused on business-to-consumer (B2C) situations. 
Moreover, a majority of PSS literature focuses on specific issues of PSS development 
separately such as cost, contracts, knowledge management, supply chain relationships 
etc. These issues may fall into one or two elements of business elements, which make 
it difficult for the companies to obtain a complete holistic view of the business chal-
lenges in PSS transition. BMC provides a visual platform for companies, which could 
allow them to consider all development issues related to various business elements 
very early in the process, thereby guiding them to develop a profitable PSS business 
model with effective strategic actions.

Abstract. New business approaches have been created as a way of differentia-
tion for enterprises, such as Product-Service System (PSS). However, there are 
many challenges companies face while implementing PSS. Aiming to identify 
these challenges a systematic literature review was done. A classification of the 
identified challenges was performed based on Canvas Business Model. In addi-
tion, a case study in which a Brazilian company failed to implement PSS is pre-
sented. This case differs from the ones reported in the existing literature, which 
show successful examples of PSS implementation. An analysis and discussion 
regarding the practical challenges found in the case study and the challenges 
found in literature are reported and possible motives for the failure on PSS im-
plementation are pointed out. The knowledge of PSS challenges can assist 
companies which want to adopt PSS since it can proactively support the devel-
opment of actions to prevent difficulties during the PSS transition.

Introduction 
In an increasingly dynamic business environment in which competition is becoming 
more intense, companies are seeking to reinvent the ways they do business, looking 
for concepts that change their traditional business models. One of the new approaches 
is the product-service system (PSS), which is defined as the result of a strategy that 
shifts the focus of a business away from simply designing and selling physical prod-
ucts to providing a system that integrates products and services capable of meeting 
specific customer needs [1-2]. Currently, most companies focus their business strate-
gies on product development or the provision of services. However, with this new 
concept, the focus of the innovation changes from designing only products or services 
to a strategy of designing integrated products and services [3]. 
Despite the benefits gained through the adoption of PSS, certain difficulties are  
encountered in relation to its practical application [1] [4-5]. These difficulties, chal-
lenges, or barriers are described in specific situation or single cases, hindering organi-
zations to a have a broader awareness of them, which could assist organizations in 
preventing the occurrence of such challenges.

The main objective of this research is the identification and systematization of the 
barriers and challenges companies encounter during the implementation of the PSS.   
Section 2 presents the method of this research. Section 3 includes a review of the 
literature on PSS and identifies barriers to its adoption. Section 4 discusses the pro-
posed systematization of the challenges and barriers to PSS. Section 5 presents a case 
study on a company that faced challenges to implement PSS and Section 6 details the 
considerations about the study.

Methodology 
The methodology used in this research was divided in two parts: a systematic litera-
ture review and a case study. 
The systematic review of the literature had the objective of identifying the barriers 
and challenges of implementing PSS addressed in existent literature. According to 
Biolchini et al. [6], a systematic literature review (SLR) is a method developed to 
standardize and evaluate evidence on a particular topic. The main steps of the litera-
ture review are formulation of the problem, data collection, data evaluation, analysis 
and interpretation of data, and completion and presentation.  
In a first moment, the formulation of the problem was written. The topics within 
this step were defining the objective of the SLR, contextualize PSS, mention the bene-
fited areas by the research and elicit the expected results. 
After that, data was collected by retrieving papers from the following databases: 
ISI/Web of Science, Scopus, and Compendex. The databases were chosen based on 
Beuren’s [29] research that points the mentioned databases as the most relevant ones 
in PSS field. The keywords used in the SLR take into account the terms used by vari-
ous authors [7-10], aiming for a more complete search on the subject. Thus, the key-
words used were as follows: “functional sales” OR “soft product” OR “integrated 
solution” OR “industrial service” OR “integrated product and service offering” OR 
“product-service system” OR “servitization” OR “functional product” OR “integrated 
product service engineering” OR “integrated product service offering.” Added to 
these keywords were strings and keywords related to challenges and barriers: “chal-
lenge” OR “barrier” OR “problem” OR “difficulty.”  
The assessment of the studies found in the last step was accomplished through 
three filters. The main criterion behind all filters was to reach the researches that were 
directly or close related to the challenges, difficulties or barriers within the adoption 
and implementation of PSS. The following steps of the SLR (i.e. analysis, interpreta-
tion and presentation) are presented in sections 3 and 4, and were used to generate the 
proposed systematization of PSS challenges. 
 
Regarding the case study, the main objectives were to find the challenges the 
company faced while the attempt of PSS implementation, and compare it with the 
challenges found in literature, summarized in the classification propose.  
To perform the case study, guidelines were taken from Voss [11], who list three 
key activities for case studies, namely, definition of a protocol for collecting data, 
data collection and data analysis. The research protocol contains the criteria used to 
select the company and the questionnaire utilized to conduct the case 
As secondary objectives and part of the criteria selection, the authors aimed to 
present a case in which a company did not have success in the attempt to adopt PSS, a

situation that has not been approached in many studies in literature. Also, the case 
was performed in a company that is present inside the Brazilian business environ-
ment, which differs from the majority of case studies published. 
To perform the case, a semi-structure questionnaire was used to guide the inter-
view. The questionnaire was developed based on the PSS challenges found in the 
Systematic Literature Review, summarized in section 4.

Literature Review 
The term Product-Service System emerged in 1999, introduced in the literature by 
Goedkoop et al. [8], through a study entitled “Product-Service Systems – Ecological 
and Economic Basics.” In that study, PSS was defined as a system of products, ser-
vices, infrastructure, and support networks that continually strive to be competitive, 
satisfy customer needs, and result in a lower environmental impact than traditional 
business models. Subsequent to this study by Goedkoop et al. [8], other authors em-
phasized the importance and need for more research on the subject, such as [1] [8] 
[12-13]. The definitions that appeared later are similar and generally interpret PSS as 
a product and service combined in a system to provide the necessary functionalities to 
the user in a way that reduces environmental impact [7]. Regardless of whether or not 
environmental issues are considered, companies that adopt this new concept seek 
financial benefits. 
Although there are many benefits of the adoption of PSS, challenges and barriers 
emerge for companies during the implementation of such a system. According to 
Baines et al. [4], some of the main challenges are related to the language of services, 
the value dimensions of integrated products and services, the development process of 
products and services, and the provision of PSS. The PSS also requires the develop-
ment of new relationships and forms of partnerships between all stakeholders in the 
value chain; for example, new customer interactions are necessary, and new partner-
ships with producers/suppliers are required [1].  
Targeting researches related to PSS challenges, the data collection step of SLR re-
sulted on a bundle of studies, which were analyzed and scanned with the objective of 
gathering possible challenges, difficulties and barriers. 
During the analysis process some classifications for the challenges were found. 
One example is Brax [14], which addresses the challenges into the following dimen-
sions: Marketing, Production, Supply, Product Design, Communication, Relationship. 
Another example of classification is proposed by Kuo et al. [5], who proposes 4 di-
mensions, External, Internal, Maintenance and Remanufacture. In addition, Martinez 
et al. (2010) [15] came out with a classification which embraces Culture PSS, Offer 
Integrated Supply, Internal Processes and Capacity, Strategic Alignment, and Cus-
tomer Relationship.  
Besides all the value and importance of the specified studies for the PSS research 
field, such classifications are considered too specific, since they are restricted to just 
one area of application, based on a single case or focused on a specific process. Brax 
[14] conducted a single case study with a primary focus on managing the maintenance 
of PSS offerings. Kuo et al. [5] also addressed challenges related to maintenance. 
Moreover, the classification proposed by Martinez et al. [15] is based on a single case 
study in a traditional manufacturing company that has succeeded in implementing 

278 
C. Di Francisco Kurak, A.P.B. Barquet, and H. Rozenfeld 
PSS. Although the authors emphasize key challenges, they do not cover issues such as 
cost structure and market segments, which were identified as important dimensions to 
be considered in the adoption of PSS business models. 
Thus, this study proposes a classification model for PSS challenges with the inten-
tion of providing a holistic view of the challenges associated with the development of 
PSS. Section 4 explains the proposed classification. 
4 
Systematization of PSS Challenges 
The classification model for PSS challenges was drawn from an analysis of the chal-
lenges identified in the systematic literature review. In this analysis, it was found that 
the challenges have a holistic character and are associated with various dimensions of 
business. In addition to these broader characteristics, the fact that PSS requires new 
processes and activities within its business models (Kuo et al., 2009; Sakao, 
Sandström and Matzen, 2009), compared to traditional ones, is another relevant point 
that was taken into account. Therefore, it was considered appropriate to classify the 
barriers and challenges identified in the literature according to the elements of a busi-
ness model, since it might help in the design of the new PSS model.  
According to Osterwalder, Pigneur, and Tucci [18], a business model is a concep-
tual tool that provides a simplified description and representation of the logic behind 
the business model of a firm. It provides the business with a holistic vision of the 
enterprise while focusing on the important relationships and questions. 
Osterwalder and Pigneur [19] developed The Canvas business model, a tool that 
can be used to decipher, analyze and design business models. Canvas creation was 
based on extensive research of the literature dealing with concepts and elements of 
different business models and the interplay between them. The elements that comprise 
the business model are written out in detail in Figure 1, and the methodology was 
tested and applied successfully across many organizations (e.g., IBM and Ericsson). 
Thus, this study adopted the business model canvas as a reference tool to classify 
PSS-related challenges.

C. Di Francisco Kurak, A.P.B. Barquet, and H. Rozenfeld 
al. [23] affirmed that the adoption of PSS requires new skills not demanded in tradi-
tional business models. 
Moreover, previous research has identified difficulties in acquiring and combining 
knowledge of the different functional areas necessary to develop PSS, showing flaws 
in the management of PSS information and knowledge [16] [24]. Because it is a new 
approach, many companies do not have expertise in PSS [14] [16] [23]. Several au-
thors mentioned the fact that the people involved in a PSS project tend to have differ-
ent backgrounds, skills, and styles of communication, which increases the difficulty 
of communication and information exchange between the actors involved in PSS 
throughout the entire value chain [9] [15] [17] [24]. 
Furthermore, issues have been raised relating to the reuse of information from pre-
vious projects, since this information is often stored in different databases, which 
hinders its accessibility [17] [24]. In addition, PSS providers lack a standardized lan-
guage service and a shared format for the communication of information and trans-
mission of knowledge for all actors in the value chain, such as suppliers, partners, and 
customers [7] [24]. There is also the issue of customer knowledge and skill in dealing 
with PSS. For example, Brax [14] commented that customers do not have enough 
knowledge to deal with planned computerized maintenance. 
The challenges specific to Technology placed under the Resources dimension show 
a limitation in relation to the suitability and selection of information systems to sup-
port the lifecycle of PSS [5] [12] [14] [16], which is also linked to the acquisition and 
management of knowledge and information about PSS.  
 
The Resources dimension also includes many challenges related to Human Re-
sources. There is a lack of support from senior management in the adoption of PSS 
[5] [7] [22] [25]. One of the reasons for such challenges is the organizational culture, 
which is oriented toward developing and commercializing products in the traditional 
way [9] [12]  [14-15] [20-21] [23] [26]. 
With respect to the Partnerships dimension, several papers mention the fear that 
organizations have of conflicts with partners due to difficulties in the division of re-
sponsibilities and the coordination of the actors in the value chain [4] [16] [23-25] 
[27]. In relation to the Processes and Activities dimension, some challenges are more 
critical for the implementation of PSS, including reverse logistics [5], project man-
agement [16-17], maintenance management [5] [14] [25] [28], and performance man-
agement using performance measures that reflect the functioning of PSS [15]. The 
need to integrate and configure processes of product development and services has 
been mentioned by several authors [4] [9] [14-16] [23] [25-27]. 
The Customer Relationships dimension reflects the challenges related to the rela-
tionship between the PSS provider and the client. A close relationship and trust are 
paramount to the successful implementation of PSS. However, there are still chal-
lenges when it comes to this relationship. Defining the responsibilities of each part 
[16] and defining when to interact with the customer are some examples [15]. Fur-
thermore, communication problems with the client, in the sense of clarifying expecta-
tions [15-16] [28] and a lack of understanding by the PSS provider in terms of the 
process and technologies used by customers, and therefore their needs, have also been 
reported [16]. This also impacts the development of contracts and negotiations that 
satisfy both parts [15]. 

 
Challenges for PSS Implementation: Identification and Classification 
281 
Dealing with financial issues is a challenge for companies. It is unclear how much 
they should charge and how they should price PSS offerings [7] [16]. Likewise, it is 
unclear how to share profits and coordinate costs [9] [23] [25]. These are issues that 
still cause businesses to doubt if PSS will be beneficial. Furthermore, the high initial 
investment and financial risk necessary to implement PSS is also a cause for concern 
for companies [12] [20-21]. These challenges are within the Cost Structure and Reve-
nue Model dimension.

Case Study 
This section describes the company business, the development of the case study and 
the results drawn by the authors. 
5.1 
Company Profile 
The case study occurred in a Brazilian company of the optoelectronic industry, which 
operates on the following sectors: Medical, Anti-glare, Aerospace and Optical  
Components. The company had recently won a prize of innovation on the medium 
companies category. The study was performed on the Ophthalmic Medical sector, 
responsible for the development of diagnosis and treatment equipments for various 
diseases of the human eye.  
The attempt of PSS implementation was considered for an equipment already de-
veloped and commercialized by the company, which is a retinographer. This equip-
ment is used for examination by ophthalmologists, e.g. capturing images of the retina. 
The product development team responsible for this equipment has eleven employees 
and the interview was made with the manager of the team. 
5.2 
Case Description 
The decision to implement and offer PSS was made because of the opportunities to 
increase the revenue and relationship intensity with clients, which is the medical mar-
ket. The company would be responsible for maintenance, upgrade and collection of 
the equipment on the end of life or contract. Clients would buy credits to use the 
equipment, which would be available to buy in the website of the company. There-
fore, clients would pay for quantity of utilization.  
Pilot projects were developed and presented in a Medical Trade Fair. During this 
occasion, some clients showed to accept and acquire PSS offers. However, the medi-
cal market considers this equipment relatively cheap. The reason for this sense is that 
the only people allowed to operate the machine in Brazil are doctors, who are a class 
of high purchase power.  Also, the idea of not owning the product resulted in a nega-
tive aspect for the doctors, since there is a “status” factor related to the ownership. 
Another factor, now linked with product characteristics, is the low level of mainten-
ance and product upgrade, decreasing the interesting of clients to pay for a offer that 
include services supply during the usage phase of the equipment. Thereby, the com-
pany decided not to offer PSS and to continue to sell the equipment in the traditional 
manner.   
Despite of the fact mentioned, the respondent highlighted an interesting point. This 
equipment had been developed in partnership with a company in USA, which  

282 
C. Di Francisco Kurak, A.P.B. Barquet, and H. Rozenfeld 
commercializes it successfully by a PSS offer. This success, in the opinion of the 
respondent, is strongly related to the market segment the USA Company reaches. In 
USA, not only ophthalmologists can operate retinographers, but also optometrists. 
The latter has minor purchasing power then the former, which can be one of the rea-
sons that they acquire PSS offers. In Brazil, the legislation allows just ophthalmolo-
gists to operate retinographers. 
5.3 
PSS Challenges 
The analysis of the data collect on the interview pointed out some factors that hin-
dered PSS implementation, mainly in Market Segment and Value Proposition dimen-
sions. 
Regarding Market Segment, the fact that ophthalmologists resist the idea of not 
having the ownership of the equipment is in accordance with many authors [5] [7] 
[12] [14] [20-21]. In this same dimension, the market conditions were also seen as a 
challenge. 
However, the search made on the literature did not find Value Proposition chal-
lenges specifically related to product characteristics. Some characteristics of the 
equipment, such as low level of maintenance and upgrade could have hampered suc-
cess on PSS implementation. Services supply is considered important in cases of fre-
quently maintenance and upgrade. In addition, some clients can be attracted to adopt 
PSS when they consider the product expensive. Then, they can make low investments 
by using the product and paying a fee periodically.  
Considering the facts mentioned, some characteristics that could have hindered 
success on PSS implementation are: 
• Low price of product for the market segment; 
• Lack of willingness about not owning the product 
• The market environment and conditions where the company considered to launch 
the product 
• Low level of breaking, failure and product upgrade; 
• High durability of the parts and life cycle  of the product. 
As the company had decided to give up PSS implementation after the prototype de-
velopment, they did not commercialize PSS offers. Therefore, challenges on others 
business model dimensions, such as Cost Structure, Revenue Model, Distribution 
Channel, had not occurred.

Conclusions 
One of the major contribution of the present study is the identification and classifica-
tion of the challenges related to the implementation of PSS. The proposed classifica-
tion has a holistic character and can be of great value to companies because it can 
support the proactive development of actions to prevent difficulties, challenges, and 
barriers in developing a business model for PSS.  

 
Challenges for PSS Implementation: Identification and Classification 
283 
The results emphasize the higher number of challenges found in terms of overall 
PSS knowledge and ease of use. This could be an indication that the overall maturity 
level of knowledge on PSS of the companies is still quite low, and implies a need for 
more research to adequately evaluate the capacity of these companies to successfully 
adopt and implement PSS methods.  
Human Resources was another dimension that had many challenges. It is clear that 
issues related to organization culture and design in PSS is a recurrent situation, and 
currently one of the research fields of highly importance. 
Regarding the case study, it was noticed the importance of the proper choose of the 
market segment in which PSS will be offered. An investigation of aspects that in-
crease the interest on PSS, such as product price, could be explored in future re-
searches. Some product characteristics also demonstrate to be fundamental when it 
comes to PSS implementation. In addition, this research showed a case that face bar-
riers during PSS implementation, differently from the cases registered in the litera-
ture, which show the best practices and success factors. 
Comparing the results of the SLR and the case study, it was possible to prove that 
issues related to the dimensions of the proposed classification actually occur, e.g. 
Market Segment and Value Proposition. However, some of he challenges faced by the 
company were not specifically found in the SLR. They are the ones directly linked 
with product characteristics within Value Proposition dimension, and market envi-
ronment in which the company will commercialize its products. This issues highlight 
the importance of taking into account new perspectives in research projects, (e.g. 
diversify the countries where studies are performed; considering failure cases as 
well), aiming more solid and complete knowledge about PSS. 
The next step of this study includes the proposition of practices for the challenges 
encountered. These practices will be defined based on literature and by using case 
studies to identify the challenges experienced by companies while adopting PSS and 
the practices used to overcome them.

Abstract. Providing Product Service Systems (PSS) calls for companies to 
react flexibly and individually to their customers’ requirements and to be able 
to engage with them in the co-creation of value. In order to meet these changing 
requirements companies need to adjust their business models accordingly. Re-
search on business models for PSS is limited. Therefore this paper analyzes the 
antecedents and outcomes of PSS conducting an empirical analysis, building on 
a questionnaire survey among 29 PSS suppliers. Results indicate that the value 
proposition is the essential part of the PSS business model, from which other 
characteristics can be derived. Companies providing PSS can generate higher 
revenues when they react flexibly towards their value propositions, are service-
oriented and able to engage in co-design with their customers.  
Keywords: business models, flexibility, capabilities of PSS suppliers.

Introduction 
Providing Product Service Systems (PSS) is a current strategy of many companies in 
industrial countries. In doing so, companies react to fierce competition on globalized 
markets and growing product conformity [1]. PSS are regarded as the future on B-to-
B markets in high wage countries, offering differentiation from competitors [2] as 
well as added value to customers and thus generating customer loyalty [3]. Addition-
ally, profits from introducing services compensate for declining revenues in the prod-
uct business [4] and stabilize cash flows.  
Nevertheless, selling PSS does not offer benefits per se. Companies are required to 
adjust their business models and acquire special capabilities. One major characteristic 
inherent to PSS is the intense collaboration and co-creation of value between custom-
er and supplier. This initiates a long lasting customer- supplier relationship covering 
the whole PSS life-cycle. Employing a business model characterizes this relationship 
in terms of delivering value, sharing responsibilities, generating revenues, sharing 
risks, and property rights [5]. In order to adapt this business model towards custom-
er’s needs, the PSS supplier should be able to flexibly react to the requirements of 
their customers during the whole life cycle. This also calls for new relationship capa-
bilities, as the ability to co-design together with the customer as well as for a high 
service-orientation of the supplier.

Up to now research on business models for PSS is still mainly theoretical or based 
on case studies. Rese, Meier, Gesing and Boßlau (2012) for example define business 
models for PSS as well as their characteristics using a morphological approach and 
elaborate three main types of business models for PSS. Other authors have described 
the special capabilities needed to offer PSS [6]. Nevertheless, no empirical analyses 
have been conducted to analyze drivers and outcomes of PSS provision.  
In order to take this next step the paper at hand builds on a questionnaire survey 
among 29 PSS suppliers. The authors assess how much flexibility is needed within a 
PSS business model and what the major capabilities a PSS supplier needs to possess 
are. Furthermore, the paper analyzes what the outcomes of providing PSS for the 
supplier and the customer are. Hence, the authors can conclude how flexibility and the 
different capabilities influence the performance of PSS provision. 
The reminder of the paper is structured as follows. First the potential drivers of 
PSS success are identified from literature. It is discussed whether they should have a 
positive or negative influence. Further, outcome variables on customer’s and suppli-
er’s side are addressed. Afterwards the empirical setting is described. Finally the re-
sults of statistical analysis are shown and their implications for PSS provision are 
discussed.

Business Models for PSS – Definition and Characteristics  
Business models for PSS are “characterizing the relationship between a customer and 
a provider (network)” [5]. More precisely they settle the value creation and delivery 
for customers, as well as how customers pay for the value delivered and profits are 
derived. In addition they contain operational and value chain elements [7]. In case of 
PSS a customer-provider relationship is characterized by one specific business model. 
One major difference between business models lies in the degree of collaboration 
between customer and supplier. In traditional business models suppliers sell single 
products or services during one-time transactions, these models are labeled as transac-
tion-based models. The degree of collaboration between customer and supplier is low. 
Meanwhile PSS business models mostly induce a high degree of collaboration, de-
scribed by the co-creation of value between customer and supplier.  
Each business model is composed of different parts. Rese, Meier, Gesing, Boßlau 
(2012) identified five characteristics that comprise a business model. The value prop-
osition characterizes the value that is delivered to the customer [8]. In general this 
value can be a product, service, or a combination of both [9]. In the case of a PSS the 
value consists of a customized and integrated bundle of products and services [10] 
and the value is co-created [11]. Automatically derived from the value proposition of 
a PSS is the division of labor. The providence of services (as part of a PSS) is auto-
matically to some degree connected with the division of labor [12]. The organization 
model describes the responsibility during utilization and thus the degree of co-
creation. In agreeing on a PSS, customer and supplier automatically have to agree on 
risk sharing issues [13]. For example if the supplier guarantees a contractual perfor-
mance, the risk of early wear out of physical parts or obsolescence shifts to his side in

comparison to a transaction-oriented model where the risk remains on the customer’s 
side. Additional risks also arise in cooperative agreements due to interdependencies 
between the partners [14]. The delivery of value and risk sharing is always connected 
to some kind of compensation, which is analyzed in the revenue model [15]. When 
selling products or services in transaction-based business models, the compensation is 
mostly a one-off payment. In the case of PSS revenue structure changes, the revenues 
are most often split into multiple payments distributed over the whole life cycle of the 
PSS. The property rights determine who owns the rights to the physical part (e.g. 
machines) of the PSS. The different characteristics of PSS business models opposed 
to transactional models are displayed in table 1:

Drivers and Outcomes of Successful PSS Provision 
3.1 
Supplier’s Flexibility in PSS 
In todays globalized markets suppliers are confronted with fast changing technologies 
and thus also with changing customer requirements. The possibility to adapt a PSS 
towards changing customers’ needs is one of its central characteristics [16]. Hence, 
suppliers including his value chain have to react flexibly. This implies the need for 
changing the business model according to the changes in the PSS. Thus the supplier 
has to exhibit flexibility towards the different characteristics of a business model.  
Nonetheless flexibility, involving changes in the PSS and thus the business model, 
can cause costs such as for new assets, training of staff towards the new requirements 

290 
M. Rese and J. Gesing 
 
or procurement costs [17]. Moreover both partners have to renegotiate the PSS condi-
tions. Thus, suppliers have to balance flexibility to fulfill customer’s demands against 
keeping the costs low in order to remain profitable. They face a dilemma between 
flexibility and stability [18]. Hence, one major challenge for PSS suppliers lies in 
handling flexible business models [18]. To address this challenge suppliers have to 
flexibly react within the different characteristics of the business model described 
above. This flexibility spans the whole life cycle, which means that suppliers might 
have to adapt the characteristics during the operation of the PSS. To react flexibly 
within the risk sharing model the capability of risk handling is necessary. The supplier 
has to assess different kinds of risks and follow a diverse risk portfolio. Also concern-
ing the revenue sharing the ability to structure revenue streams is essential. Hence, as 
suppliers face a trade off between flexibility and stability, it might not be necessary to 
show flexibility towards each of the characteristics. 
3.2 
Supplier’s Capabilities for Offering PSS 
Offering PSS differs from offering mere products or single services. Hence, suppliers 
need new capabilities and skills to be able to tailor PSS towards individual customer’s 
needs [19]. In addition to traditional skills such as technical knowhow, research and 
development, service and relationship based capabilities are needed.  
One of the most important capabilities is the service orientation of the supplier. It 
has to be implemented in the organizational structure as well as in the corporate cul-
ture and mindset of people [20]. Traditional production oriented companies have to 
recognize that services are not merely a necessary evil and can be given away for free 
[19]. Service orientation implies solving customers’ problems, giving advice to cus-
tomers, as well as developing a relationship with the customer to deliver complex 
services [20]. Showing service orientation is associated with having a positive per-
formance effect. On the one hand services have to be produced together with the  
customer with a high degree of interaction, forming sustainable supplier-customer 
relationships [21]. On the other hand services, if not given away for free, offer higher 
margins than products [22]. Thus, service orientation should be of utmost importance 
for PSS suppliers. Yet many manufacturing companies are still struggling to imple-
ment service orientation into their company [21]. 
Another important capability is being able to co-design products and services with 
customers. PSS are designed to meet customers’ individual needs [13]. Therefore it is 
of utmost importance to integrate the customer during the development stage of the 
PSS. By this means the supplier should be able to obtain his customer`s demands and 
wishes for the PSS and convert them into technical specifications. As customers often 
have problems at the beginning with articulating their needs and lack insight into the 
complex domain of PSS a continuous feedback from both sides is necessary to design 
the PSS for the customer. Otherwise, the PSS might not meet true customer’s re-
quirements. In this case the supplier has to redesign the PSS, which in turn causes 
costs. Hence, the ability to co-develop the PSS with the customer from the beginning 
of the development stage should be an important capability for PSS suppliers.

291 
 
A further advantage linked to PSS is the continuous improvement of products and 
services due to the information gathered during PSS operation [3]. In PSS the supplier 
establishes a relationship to his customer and thus can gather feedback concerning the 
performance of the PSS. This is not possible in transaction based business models 
where the supplier sells a product based on a one-time exchange, without building a 
relationship. However, continuous improvement can only work if the supplier has the 
ability to gather and use the information in a systematic way. He has to listen to cus-
tomer’s feedback and pass it on to the development department. Meanwhile the de-
velopment department has to be open to feedback and new ideas and not caught up in 
their routines and habits. Thus, the ability to use customer feedback should be another 
important capability of PSS suppliers. 
3.3 
Outcomes of Offering PSS 
PSS are supposed to offer benefits not only to the supplier but also to the customer. 
For suppliers PSS offer the ability to differentiate themselves from the growing 
conformity on product markets [2]. Profits from selling products are more and more  
declining due to this conformity whereas services offer higher margins which can 
counterbalance this decline [4]. Furthermore, services offer stable revenues along the 
whole life cycle and are thus able to reduce the volatility of fluctuating revenues from 
products. Additionally, services offer the ability to build sustainable supplier custom-
er relationships, which can be used for cross-selling and in turn for additional reve-
nues. Thus, providing product service bundles is perceived as being able to establish a 
more sustainable source of competitiveness [23]. It should positively influence the 
overall performance of the company, having a positive influence on its revenues.  
Customers also benefit from PSS in multiple ways. First, they can benefit from the 
know-how and expertise of the supplier [24]. The experience of the supplier and hav-
ing multiple customers whom he offers PSS can lead to economies of scales. Further, 
due to the co-development between customer and supplier the PSS solution fits the 
customer’s needs better than a standalone product and thus leads to higher perfor-
mance. Purchasing a turn-key solution which the supplier has already tested addition-
ally lowers the performance risks for the customers [25]. Due to these reasons,  
product service strategies influence the overall client satisfaction [23] as it offers su-
perior value. Thus, providing PSS should have a positive effect on customer’s benefit. 
3.4 
Research Model 
To conclude, PSS suppliers need to balance flexibility and stability as well as acquire 
new capabilities to deliver PSS successfully in a way so that both parties profit from 
it. The described capabilities should influence PSS provision in a positive way. 
Meanwhile it might not be necessary to show flexibility regarding each of the charac-
teristics of the business model, as suppliers face a trade off between costs and benefits 
of flexibility. There are no assumptions up to now as to how the flexibility regarding 
the different characteristics influences the PSS provision. 
Concerning the outcomes, providing PSS should have a positive effect on suppli-
ers’ revenues as well as on customers’ benefit. These relationships are shown in  
figure 1.

Model Results 
In a second step the framework was tested using structural equation modeling. Fit 
values were calculated which indicate an acceptable model fit (CFI = 0.82; RMSEA = 
0.10; SRMR = 0.07). Only the RMSEA is slightly above the recommended value of 
0.085. Model results are shown in figure 2. 
Model results indicate that providing PSS has a significant positive influence on 
suppliers’ revenues. Further concerning the customers’ side PSS also positively influ-
ences customers’ benefits. Addressing what abilities suppliers need to offer PSS  
flexibility in the value proposition, service orientation, as well as co-design have a 
significant positive effect, whereas flexibility in the organizational model, in risk 
sharing and property rights have a negative but not significant effect. The use of cus-
tomer feedback has no significant effect on PSS provision.

Discussion of Results 
The value proposition of a business model has been identified as its central part from 
which all other characteristics can be derived [5]. Thus, showing flexibility regarding 
this characteristic seems to be of greater strategic priority for PSS suppliers. Mean-
while flexibility within the organizational model, risk sharing and the property rights 
show a negative effect on PSS success. Hence, too much flexibility might have a neg-
ative effect. Additionally showing flexibility within the risk sharing model needs the 
ability to assess all risks correctly as well as having a balanced risk portfolio. These 
might be a major challenge for PSS suppliers. Facing the trade-off between flexibility 
and stability, suppliers should be most flexible within the value propositions they 
offer to their customers. Afterwards they can negotiate about the other elements of the 
business model. 
Further, being service oriented appears to be one highly important capability for 
PSS suppliers. They have to regard services as a major strategy to compete against 
other companies. If services are merely seen as an add-on for products, the emphasis 
will still be on product businesses. As a result, services may be given away for free by 
sales employees or executed poorly. The first most probably leads to a decline in the 
supplier’s revenues, because he does not earn anything with the services. The latter 
will lead to unsatisfied customers, which in turn might prompt them to change the 
supplier and hence, again leads to lower profits. Thus, we can conclude that service 
orientation is highly important for PSS suppliers. 
Moreover co-design has a positive effect on PSS provision. Co-design results in a 
PSS that truly meets customers’ needs. If suppliers fail to do so, customers will not be 

296 
M. Rese and J. Gesing 
 
satisfied with the PSS provided. The supplier may have to readjust the PSS, which 
causes additional costs. Further the customer might choose another supplier the next 
time and perform negative word of mouth. All these consequences lead to a decline in 
supplier’s profits. Consequently we can identify co-design as an important capability 
for PSS suppliers. 
Meanwhile the use of customer feedback has no significant effect in our study. One 
reason could be the individualized adaption of PSS for the single customer. If PSS are 
designed very differently for every customer it might be difficult to learn from pre-
vious projects. In this case the ability to co-design is even more important. Another 
reason could be the small sample size. These effects are discussed within the limita-
tion section. 
Concerning the outcomes PSS provision has positive effects for the supplier and 
for the customer. Providing PSS positively influences supplier’s revenues. Hence, by 
offering PSS suppliers can generate higher margins and compete against their compet-
itors. On the customer’s side, PSS positively influences the perceived benefit. Conse-
quently, by integrating products and services suppliers can offer higher values to  
customers and solve their problems better.  
4.4 
Limitations 
The empirical study reveals interesting results, nevertheless there are some limita-
tions. First of all the sample only contains 29 companies, which is quite a small sam-
ple size. Small sample sizes can lead to type II errors. This means that test results 
indicate non-significant effects, although they might exist. Hence, some effects in the 
data may not be recognized. To overcome this limitation a follow up study with a 
larger sample size is necessary. 
Second the outcome variable on the customer’s side (customer benefit) was meas-
ured using the information provided by the supplier. Thus, there can be a discrepancy 
between the customer’s and supplier’s perception. In PSS provision this discrepancy 
should be lower than in transaction based business models, due to the close interac-
tion between customer and supplier. Nevertheless, a follow up study should match 
suppliers’ and customers’ perceptions. 
5 
Conclusion 
The study at hand conducted a survey study about the drivers and outcomes of PSS 
provision. Up to know no empirical studies in this area exist, hence, this study is the 
first survey among PSS suppliers. 
Our study reveals that providing PSS instead of products has a positive effect on 
supplier’s revenues as well as on customers’ perceived benefits. Thus, providing PSS 
seems to be beneficial for companies. Nevertheless, companies have to obtain certain 
capabilities to provide PSS successfully. They have to be service-oriented, be able to 
co-design with the customer and show high flexibility with regard to the value propo-
sition. Thus companies willing to enter the PSS business should place a high

importance on these capabilities in addition to delivering superior products and ser-
vices. If suppliers succeed in doing so PSS offers high advantages to them.

Abstract. Product/Service-Systems (PSS) are a strategic approach wherein the 
value proposition covers the performance of a system throughout the whole life 
cycle. Many industrial companies are challenged on many levels in the transi-
tion process towards a PSS oriented approach. Much of the literature has until 
now focused on PSS from a design object perspective, and less focus has been 
on how the business model of the company must be designed simultaneously 
with the offering, covering topics as organisational restructuring, value chain 
collaboration plus a change management focus. This paper presents a PSS strat-
egy topic matrix, as a boundary object for the company, aimed at creating a 
shared understanding of important factors in the organisation while evaluating, 
developing, implementing and operating a PSS strategy. This is done through 
an empirical foundation of twelve companies representing a whole branch in-
dustry, together with three cases of industrial best-practice.  
Keywords: Product/Service-System, business model strategies, organisational 
change, value-chain collaboration.

Introduction  
Across sectors, industrial companies are increasingly moving toward strengthening 
their after-sales activities through introduction or improvement of service provisions.    
The notion of Product/Service-System (PSS) as an emerging business concept is in-
creasingly being adapted by practitioners in industry. In doing so many of the compa-
nies are facing a complex transition phase as the design object is changed from a 
physical product, to the performance of the system throughout the whole life cycle [1], 
when designing a PSS, the company takes decisions that creates a direct and disposed 
effect on many aspects of the value chain and require an understanding of the life 
cycle. This creates demands for change in the organisation, ranging from an opera-
tional level to a strategic management, and business model creation perspective. A 
PSS strategy therefore requires decisions and actions regarding changes in the net-
work, development processes, and alternative cash flows [1]. When looking at PSS at 
a strategic level there is a need to develop normative methods that can be shared 
across departments in the organisation and across organisations to enable the PSS 
strategy evaluation, development, implementation and operation.

 L. Neugebauer et al. 
Looking into other research fields as business management, many tools and meth-
ods have been created for general management and business model creation. Over 
time, the complexity created by accumulation of tools will impede the company’s 
ability to find the right tools or method for the task at hand. For this reason recent 
research within this field, attempts to provide easy accessible overview tools. This 
paper attempts to establish a tool with the same aim, directed specifically against the 
PSS field, for use in evaluating, developing, implementing and operating new PSS 
strategies.  
PSS literature has long focused on defining what constitutes a PSS, together with 
the goal of a PSS approach, research is currently focused on how to develop a PSS, 
which is focusing to a large extend solely on the development task, on different levels 
in the organization. Besides this research also focus on evaluating how companies 
deal with the implemented business model, but little research has been on the overall 
considerations of whether a company should move towards a PSS approach or not.     
Researches on industrial cases investigating, what parameters influences a PSS and 
therefore are important to take into account in all phases, from evaluating to operating 
a PSS, are therefore sparse. This paper presents three best-practice cases of PSS ori-
ented companies, together with twelve companies representing a whole branch indus-
try, which are all in the transition process towards a PSS approach.     
The proposition for this paper is:  
When staging the transition process towards a PSS approach, the decision to change, 
as well as the process of change itself, demands an inherent awareness in the compa-
ny of what topics are important to consider, internally as well as externally to the 
company.  
The proposition will be investigated through the following questions:    
1. What topics are important to take into consideration when developing and main-
taining a PSS approach?     
2. How can this list of topics be made manageable for an organisation when navigat-
ing the change process?

Methodology 
The research design of this study follows a case study design [2], [3] which for this 
study builds upon the following sources of data and evidence: 
- Literature study 
- Empirical findings from the PROTEUS innovation consortium consisting of 
twelve case companies 
- Three best-practise cases from other industries than that of PROTEUS   
2.1 
Research Cases 
The main source of empirical evidence for this study is the PROTEUS innovation 
consortium, which consists of twelve companies from the maritime industry, a branch 
organisation, a technical service partner (consultancy), and international university 
partners. All involved companies are interested in normative methods to bridge the 
challenge of effectively and systematically integrating service development into their

301 
product development and business creation process.  The companies are all interna-
tional, ranging in size of 30-3000+ employees and have different levels and years of 
experience in approaching the PSS transition challenge. Secondarily empirical in-
sights have been gathered from case studies conducted across three industries differ-
ent from that of PROTEUS: Aerospace, automotive and land transport. All three case 
companies have successfully managed the transition to a profitable PSS business 
model. The last mentioned cases are used as validating and improving the established 
framework, created within the context of the PROTEUS companies.    
2.2 
Data Gathering and Analysis  
The empirical insights have been gathered over a period of 24 months, covering mul-
tiple research phases in the consortium. The data have been collected through ap-
proximately 30 interviews (2-4 hours), two site visit at each company, four workshops 
gathering the consortium, and two in-depth case studies; one in the context of a single 
company, and one covering a case of two companies. Besides the companies of the 
consortia multiple interactions have taken place with various stakeholders of the in-
dustry. The best-practice cases were identified through PSS networks and were ex-
plored through an extensive desktop research and an in-depth interview with each 
company, through a semi-structured interview approach, covering the topics as: moti-
vation, PSS offerings, change process, challenges, and business model. All empirical 
insights have been documented through, personal field notes, reports, and audio re-
cordings. The analysis have been build upon an adaptive-research approach using the 
pattern matching strategy where  information collection have been conducted in paral-
lel with the process of analysis. Comparing findings with literature have aided the 
creation of new themes emerging from the empirical insights. Validation of empirical 
insights has been done in collaboration with the companies, either through report 
verification or presentation and feedback.

Literature Review  
PSS as a business strategy is described in literature as a phenomena, but little is writ-
ten on how to aid a company in the transition towards it. Prior work [1] has indicated 
the following multiple areas besides PSS should be included when looking at this; 
Change management, Business management, Value network management, and Rela-
tionship marketing. 
3.1 
Product/Service-System Approaches 
Within the field of PSS, attention is focused on different levels. This paper focus lies 
on PSS as a business strategy, and also touches upon PSS as value creation, where the 
design process perspective is in focus. Despite PSS being a relatively new field in 
management and engineering design research, a mass of useful tools and frameworks 
have emerged from the PSS area, whereof many are still in the process of validation 

302  
 L. Neugebauer et al. 
and refinement within industry. A proposed model of PSS business development 
shows the link between development activities and business strategy, illustrating that 
a PSS as a design object, needs a broad focus in the organisation [4].  A tool directed 
towards the PSS designers are a so-called PSS morphology where in different PSS 
strategic characteristics and PSS dimensions can be designed, to mention a few are: 
Availability of offering (ownership), Revenue mechanism (cost structure), Partner or 
collaborators (external view) [9]. Besides this model can be mentioned the model 
PSS typology [5] which can aid in the choice of what service degree the company 
would prefer, as e.g. product related advice, and product sharing and activity man-
agement. These frameworks are uncovering many important elements to take into 
consideration when considering a transition from a product-oriented company to a 
service oriented business, but still lack a compilation to use on a strategic level. When 
looking at the organisational structure different possibilities of organising the service 
development can be carried out through different strategies; the service operation can 
be integrated in all levels within the company, and it can be dedicated to a business 
unit, or outsourced by partnering with external service entities. [4], or a mix of all 
three, they all have different network structure, ranging in nature of internal towards 
external network.   
A recent PSS study created through an extensive empirical study focus to a large 
extend on the stage where the company have established itself in a constellation of a 
PSS business model, and how their approach has changed over time, and what chal-
lenges it had brought with it (the study looks retrospectively at the PSS strategy  
development), and do not focus on the early stages where to evaluate whether the 
company are suited a PSS approach or not, which by the authors are seen as vital and 
an area for future focus.   
3.2 
The Network as a Catalyst for Exploration and Transformation  
Companies’ competitiveness should be evaluated through a holistic network perspec-
tive, as it is the totality of the value chain, or “value system” that represents the true 
competiveness. A trend is moving towards competition being based on value systems 
against value systems, it is therefore vital to be able to diagnose and manage the ex-
ternal network of the company. [6]. When looking at PSS research, the literature 
points towards PSS being strengthened if a collaborative approach is taken when con-
ceptualising, implementing and/or operating the system, to be able to sustain and 
enhance the utility of the offering throughout its lifetime, which demands a more 
advanced customer and supplier relationship management, recognised by the new 
field of relationship marketing [7], as the value creation process to a larger extend is 
not held solely by one company, but should be seen on a system-solution level, [7].  
When changing from a product supplier to a product/service supplier different rela-
tionships are needed (both internal and external) following the advancement in the 
PSS approach [8]. The network structure is important to navigate when designing the 
business strategy of a company, as all relationship together carry opportunities for 
new constellations of revenue, information, and resources, needed for innovation and 
the possibility to sustain this [9]. This network approach is yelling for new business 
models, wherein a shared value system can be reached, here the value proposition can 
be created by a cluster of companies; therefore revenue streams among other becomes 
crucial topics.

3.3 
Approaching Business Model Creation  
The field of business model research is rather new (with actual beginnings in the late 
nineties) and still quite divergent with regard to the interpretation of central terms 
such as “business model” and “strategy”. [10]. Osterwalder et al have done an exten-
sive study into business models, and on basis of this developed a framework termed 
business model canvas. The business model canvas can be used as a boundary object 
from the initial conceptual stages of planning a new strategy to the execution phases. 
Its contents are static, but the interpretation and focus of each dimension evolves as 
the change process unfolds. This depiction of the business model research field is 
reminiscent of the PSS research field, where central terms are also interpreted in a 
divergent manner.  
In the context of this paper, a distinction is made between business model and 
strategy. As stated by Magretta [11], “Business models describe, as a system, how the 
pieces of a business fit together. But they don’t factor in one critical dimension of 
performance: competition...” Osterwalder et al adds to this distinction by stating:”… 
strategy includes execution and implementation, while the business model is more 
about how a business works as a system. Having identified competitors and other 
external actors as key influencers in forming and executing a PSS based strategy and 
realizing the importance of capturing the temporal dimensions of the process, the 
authors have chosen to place the frameworks presented in this paper in the strategy 
category.  
3.4 
Understanding Change in Organisations 
For decades, the field of change management has sought to describe and understand 
the process of strategic planning and execution in companies. 
This paper seeks to elucidate the process of strategic implementation of PSSs by 
incorporating the widely adopted and proven theories for managing change. Several 
authors provide generic processes describing the different phases of strategic change. 
In this paper, the authors have opted for the BPR Project Stage Activity Framework 
described by Kettinger et al [12]. The framework deals with the following stages for 
change: Envision – Initiate – Diagnose – Redesign – Reconstruct – Evaluate. Sup-
plementary to this the authors is Kotter’s  change model “Eight steps to Transforming 
Your Organisation” [13]. Here Kotter primarily focus on the implementation stages 
of the change process, contributing several organisational and political dimensions. 
For instance, in his initial phase “Establishing a sense of urgency” he emphasises the 
significance of creating a common understanding of the need for change.

Empirical Insights  
This section will present the findings, through three empirical cases of companies that 
have successfully transitioned from manufacturing companies to PSS providing com-
panies.   
 

304  
 L. Neugebauer et al. 
4.1 
Case A  
Company A develops and produces integral engine components for the aviation in-
dustry. The aviation industry was one of the first to implement PSS offerings in the 
form of change in product ownership and a fixed engine maintenance cost over an 
extended period of time which has become a market trend. A contributor to this trend 
has been the high regulations on engine maintenance. With a development time of 3 
to 5 years and an aftermarket life of 30 to 50, company A has to plan and align its 
offerings to support the engine manufacturer throughout the product life phases. As its 
components are an integral part of the engine, company A has to align their develop-
ment process with its customers. Company A´s development process need to be agile 
and flexible to meet the ever changing requirements to the changes made in other 
components that affects the design, dimensions, and location of the component. De-
sign for maintenance becomes complex as minor alterations of the surrounding com-
ponents can have great effects on the accessibility and serviceability of Company A’s 
components. To enable the provision of the needed PSS solutions a change in the 
solution development was required. The strategic decision to commit to the market 
demand created high demands on the financial part of the business. With an extended 
product life the potential revenues in the aftermarket are substantial. As the aircraft 
owners essentially lease the engine, the engine manufacturer has high up-front ex-
penses but also high aftermarket revenues. To manage the high up-front cost the en-
gine manufacturers and suppliers enter a financial partnership agreeing to split costs 
and earnings through the product life cycle.  
Company A already had a long history with business models based on revenues 
throughout the product life cycle in other customer segments, so when the market and 
customer demand in the commercial customer segment arose, they were ready to act 
upon it.  Along with the change in strategy a different set of competences was needed. 
Where the company developers had always had a high technical level the developers 
needed to be agile when co-developing with the customers and potentially also other 
partners, as well be able to incorporate demands from  the aftermarket (as repair activ-
ities, welding etc.) into the product development. One way the competence and know-
ledge level was raised within the company was by entering into collaboration with 
research institutions. Thereby the company had access to the latest research on the 
subject as well as research projects focusing on their company and its challenges. The 
collaboration with the knowledge institutions is also part of a human resource strate-
gy. By hiring the candidates when they finished their studies, they also had access to a 
workforce that already knew the inner workings of the company and that already had 
acquired many of the competences needed.  
4.2 
Case B 
Company B has a long history of producing and selling coating for automotive refin-
ish workshops. Company B was one of five market-leading companies to compete on 
products that were becoming a commodity. To be able to compete and differentiate 
themselves from their competitor they made the strategic decision to change.  

 
Deciding on PSS: A Framework for PSS Strategies 
305 
Company B went from what they describe as being “can-kickers” to a business part-
ner that offers holistic workshop solutions to their customers; including workshop 
audit and design, profit management, and business educations. Company B’s custom-
ers have a high technical knowledge, but many are small start-up companies that had 
grown larger but had not been trained in the operation and growth of a paint shop. The 
customers were already loyal and trusting to the company which created the founda-
tion for a close collaboration throughout the expansion of their own and Company B’s 
business.   
To sell the new holistic solutions a comprehensive set of new competences was 
needed inside the organisation. Instead of merely selling coatings the sales personnel 
representative should be able to consult on and sell workshop design, machinery and 
business thinking. For this the company created a three-year education programme for 
a selected number of suitable employees. With the new offer of workshop design they 
increased their offer portfolio to include equipment for the workshop, so the customer 
was able to order the equipment directly when deciding on the design. Expanding the 
offerings in this way also meant creating a new supply network as well as planning 
the logistic between suppliers and customers aligning this to the process of executing 
the workshop design.  In the effort of developing business courses for their customers 
they hired in external experts in business coaching and organisational development, to 
integrate the company’s expertise and customer knowledge into a set of tailor-made 
courses for their customers.  
It was challenging to alter the culture within Company B. If a sales person is going 
to sell integrated workshop solutions and supporting business solutions instead of 
coatings, the sales person has to be able see the benefits for the customer of these new 
offerings. In this the communication from management to the different departments 
proved essential. The language, with which the alterations were communicated to the 
workers, was too academic for the workers to relate to their day-to-day practises. First 
when the communication problems were cleared, the workers were able to success-
fully sell the PSS solution.  
4.3 
Case C 
Company C develops, produce and sell transport solutions and has through ten years 
transformed its business to a holistic PSS provider. It changed its role from a manu-
facture and component supplier to a financial partner and consultancy in transport 
solutions. By this company B also changed its business model as new revenue streams 
was created, as its customers could choose between different financial solutions, all 
with different level of ownership of the products.  
Important here for company C was its training of its sales personnel to be consult-
ants, a change in competence level. Besides this the process of the sales procedure 
was changed as it in a sales situation would use a tool for calculating and configure 
the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) in collaboration with the customer, the customer 
culture was to a high extend reflecting a market change, as they possess a changed 
mental mindset. Besides this a change was also created in the internal processes and 

306  
 L. Neugebauer et al. 
the organisational structure, as the companies new approach linked together new-sales 
and after-sales creating a customer lock-on.               
To be able to extend its service network and hereby company reach, company C, 
made a close collaboration with its dealer network, a change in the external network 
constellation. The dealer was changed from being both a service workshop and a sales 
house, to be only a service workshop, which was done through an educational pro-
gramme, changing the external network capabilities and creating a direct sales force 
internal the company instead of a mix of external and internal. Company C, had 
through a customer focus created a set of KPI´s for the dealers to be measured 
against, and hereof be rewarded. The dealers had an increased profit based on this 
new relationship, illustrating a new network structure.  
The internal culture was a source of barrier in the company and a large change in 
employee force all the way up to management, was created as many was stuck in the 
old culture of being a manufacture company. The company made a cultural check list 
wherein: Capacity, competence and commitment where three important elements.            
Company C made a total redesign of its value proposition, which was done through 
a company strategy ranging ten years. Company C sell: A guaranteed cost per km, 
this was among other things made possible due to the change in the product as it be-
came more digital, whereof the company could make proactive and preventive main-
tenance, together with statistically planned maintenance schedules. This also changed 
the information of which to base service on. Information sharing and communication 
was increased between company C, its dealers and its customers. The transparency of 
the cost throughout the products lifetime was made more transparent, causing a rela-
tionship wherein trust could be created.

Generel Findings: The PSS Strategy Topic Matrix    
Based on the pattern matching strategy, where an iterative process of relating theory 
and empirical insights, reveal new knowledge, a set of topics of importance emerged, 
topics of importance when dealing with the transition towards a PSS strategy, the 
authors have compiled this into a framework doubt: PSS strategy topic matrix, see 
Figure 1 
Figure 1 shows the framework and the empirical foundation, it gives a holistic view 
of the framework and how it is grounded in each of the companies. The table illus-
trates how topics have been identified as important in each company. Whereof the 
mark in the table should be understood as; (i) observed by the researcher (implicitly 
referred to by the interviewee), (ii) mentioned explicitly by interviewee, or (iii) in the 
iteration of the two mentioned with literature.  
The framework was developed by categorising all the topics into six main catego-
ries, which are mirrored in what a company would consider as internal (departments, 
organisational culture etc.) and external elements (suppliers, competitors etc.). The 
categories that emerged was:  “Stakeholders and stakeholder processes”, “Capabili-
ties”, “Influencers”, “Network” and “Offering”.

Discussion and Implication 
This section will elaborate the findings and implication for each of the two research 
questions. The first objective of the research has been to identify a list of important 
topics that should be considered when developing and maintaining a PSS approach. 
The second objective was to make the topics manageable for an organization. The 
PSS Strategy Topic Matrix (PSTM) is an attempt to present the identified topics in a 
manageable way. Many of these topics have diverse implications and adopt different 
meanings depending on the context, company dynamics as well as semantics under-
standings. E.g. Communication can regard communicating the need for change by 

308  
 L. Neugebauer et al. 
management to the employees, but it also refers to communication between relevant 
stakeholders in the development process. The nature of the topic change in according 
to context. This also apply over time. When discussing the topics with the case com-
panies it was clear that the topics transcended the change phases; from Envision to 
Evaluate in Kettinger’s framework.  
    For instance, in case company B, the topic of competencies was recognized 
throughout the change phases. In the early envision phase, the company realized that 
it could benefit from training its sales personnel. From here, the change process went 
into the initiate phase where a collaboration with a knowledge partner was estab-
lished. In the diagnosis phase, the company realized that the training program had to 
be altered to meet the needs of the sales personnel. This led to the reconstruction 
phase, where the company implemented an updated version of its training program. 
Lastly, it is clear that the topic of competencies is still relevant in the final change 
phase, evaluate, as the company is now constantly monitoring the training program 
and adjusting it in order to establish the competencies needed in the market. 
In some cases the topics revealed themselves to be tightly related. In the case of 
Company C, the internal topic of finance has clear links to the external dimension of 
financial partners as the internal processes and roles of the finance department will 
inevitably have to change to accommodate the interaction with an external  
stakeholder.  
A similar argument is valid for the changed revenue streams in Company C that 
have implications for both customer and customer segments topic and internal topics 
such as finance and information and communication. 
The ability of the topics to work in different contextual setting is a great strength, 
but also one of the main limitations of the matrix. Companies looking to quantify and 
model business processes, relations etc. will fall short if trying to use the framework 
presented herein. Here, one must remember the analogies between Osterwalder’s 
business model concept and the PSS strategy matrix; the former was never intended 
as a detail planning tool – rather, it is a boundary object for gaining an overview. 
Having established an overview, literature offers a mass of excellent tools for going 
into the details. The same thing can be stated for the role of the PSS Strategy Topic 
Matrix and its relation to tools available in the field. 
In evaluating the general validity of the topics presented, one has to bear in mind 
the origins of the framework. The main empirical basis lies in the PROTEUS research 
project which is exclusively focused on the maritime sector. This attribute could pose 
a problem with regard to general applicability of the framework. It is important to 
underline this point in relation to; firstly, the inclusion of three in depth cases from 
outside the maritime sector has ensured a wider spread in the empirical data. Second-
ly, it is not the claim of the authors, that the framework presented should be seen as 
completed – indeed, more topics are likely to emerge as the framework migrates into 
other industries with unique attributes. Also, the case companies all work on a busi-
ness to business (B2B) basis. Moving from B2B to B2C (business to consumer) 
would most likely require additions to the framework. 
 

 
Deciding on PSS: A Framework for PSS Strategies 
309 
To further touch upon the validity and limitations of the PSTM, the authors have 
not been able to validate the results with the case companies before formulating the 
framework. Ideally, the framework should go through, at least, one iteration before it 
is widely adopted. For this reason, the coming period will be spent on doing just that. 
Finally, we revisit the assumption made in the literature review section, that the 
framework presented herein is best described as a strategic one (as opposed to a busi-
ness model framework); we have found clear indications in the empirical studies of 
the case companies, that external factors such as competitors as well as considerations 
regarding implementation are of great importance to the companies. For that reason, 
the assumption is seen as validated in accordance with the definitions by Magretta and 
Osterwalder.

Conclusions and Future Work 
RQ1: The list of important topics has been presented in the PSS Strategy Topic Ma-
trix. As the presented cases verify, the topics have all been considered by companies 
that have moved toward a PSS approach. 
RQ2: Presenting the topics in matrix form, where the topics are divided into cate-
gories which are mirrored in internal and external considerations are the authors at-
tempt to enable organisations to overview and use the topics in the change process. 
This is a first attempt that has not yet been tested, and thereby verified in industry. 
The list is not total and will most change when applied in other industries.   
Approaching the transition towards a product/service-oriented business a need for 
an overall framework for aiding this process has been recognised. This paper presents 
a matrix that uncovers the topics a company should to be aware of when considering a 
PSS strategy. The framework (matrix) currently consists of 35 topics, which are di-
vided into six categories seen through the lenses of internal and external perspectives. 
The matrix is intended to act as a boundary object between stakeholders across func-
tional areas within the company. It is meant to create a shared awareness of what is 
important for a company to take into account while e.g. developing, marketing, or 
selling the offering.  
It is found that building a business strategy for PSS can be done with help of exist-
ing tools as e.g. the business Model Canvas, where certain perspectives are added.  
The authors plan to further explore, revise, and validate the matrix together with 
industry and PSS design students. It has already been identified that the different top-
ics have different importance and influence in different phase of the change process, 
further research should explore the nature and extend of this.

Abstract. An Industrial Product Service System (IPS²) in the use-oriented busi-
ness model is delivered to customers with the guarantee of high performance. 
Due to dynamic changes and uncertainties in the IPS² use phase, suppliers carry 
risks when trying to achieve the expected high performance or keeping the 
budget. In order to reduce these risks and to keep the balance between IPS² per-
formance and cost, suppliers have to improve IPS² based on the decisions taken 
on its management level. These decisions can only be made, when an accurate 
monitoring of IPS² has been achieved. This paper introduces an indicator 
framework for decision-makers of IPS² suppliers to monitor IPS² in the use-
oriented business model in the use phase. Indicators are defined with regard to 
IPS² performance, IPS² lifecycle cost and influencing factors. A monitoring me-
thod with early risk warning against risks using indicator corridors will also be 
introduced. 
Keywords: IPS² Monitoring, Indicator, Decision-Maker, IPS² Performance, 
IPS² Lifecycle Cost.

Introduction 
An IPS² is viewed as an integrated bundle of key industrial product (e.g. a micro-
machining tool) and related services [1]. In the use-oriented business model, an IPS² 
is delivered to the customer with the guarantee of high performance and is usually 
integrated as a production unit into a customer production process [1], [2]. Because of 
dynamic changes and uncertainties in the IPS² use phase, IPS² suppliers have to im-
prove their IPS² during its use phase [3]. The IPS² improvement processes require-
ment a lot of management decisions [4]. Right decisions can only be made based on 
an exact monitoring of IPS² and an analysis of IPS² risks. 
Generally, from the supplier’s view, IPS² risks can be lower IPS² performance than 
expected and higher cost than budget [5], [6]. The prerequisite for detecting these two 
risks is the monitoring of IPS². Although IPS² has been exhaustively researched by 
international academics, the topic of IPS² monitoring for decision-makers has not yet 
been sufficiently focused (cf. chapter 2). 
This paper introduces an indicator framework for decision-makers of IPS² suppli-
ers to monitor IPS² in the use-oriented business model in the use phase. That way,

related indicators are defined primarily for IPS² performance, IPS² lifecycle cost and 
related major influencing factors. Later, they are bunched together into a systematic 
indicator framework. A method for monitoring IPS² and for early warning IPS² risks 
will be introduced towards the end of the paper.

Related Work 
Present research can be classified into the measurement and monitoring of IPS² in the 
development and the use phase. 
An important IPS² decision is the configuration of IPS² and the selection of the best 
IPS² variant in the IPS² early development phase. [7] introduces an approach to simu-
late IPS² performance. [8] and [9] both adopt lifecycle costing (LCC) methods to 
predict the overall IPS² cost for the selection of an economical IPS² variant. Moreo-
ver, an indicator system is introduced in [10] to configure IPS² with an adjustable 
goal. These approaches can support decision-makers to select the potentially best IPS² 
variant. As the actual IPS² environment in the use phase is quite different from its 
prediction in the early development phase, it is inevitable to improve the developed 
IPS² during the use phase based on a continuous monitoring of IPS². Related methods 
for monitoring IPS² have not been introduced in these works. 
Some works introduce methods to measure and evaluate IPS² in its use phase. [11] 
introduces an evaluation scheme for IPS² with a focus on sustainability and customer 
value. In [12] an indicator system is developed based on balanced scorecard (BSC) to 
monitor IPS². [13] describes an approach to evaluate customer satisfaction for IPS² 
design. Due to various customer requirements on IPS², IPS² can be offered in different 
business models. Different criteria are required to measure IPS² in different business 
models (function-oriented, use-oriented and result-oriented) [1]. The approaches in-
troduced in these works disregard different IPS² business models, so that they can 
only measure IPS² very abstractly and cannot be used to measure and monitor IPS² in 
the use-oriented business model in detail.

Requirements 
3.1 
Requirements for an Indicator Framework 
In order to measure and to monitor IPS² in the use-oriented business model in the use 
phase, an indicator framework should be developed as a foundation. Three major 
aspects have been identified for the indicator framework. 
IPS² Performance: In the use-oriented business model, IPS² is a customer-specific 
problem solution with the guarantee of high performance. Thus, IPS² performance 
must be considered within the indicator framework.  
IPS² Lifecycle Cost: From the supplier’s perspective, the development and marketing 
of IPS² is associated with the improvement of its competitive abilities and with up-
grading its value-added chain in the end [15]. Low cost in the whole IPS² lifecycle 
should be a concrete and measurable goal of IPS² suppliers. Hence, IPS² lifecycle cost 
should be monitored by decision-makers and considered within the indicator frame-
work. Due to the complexity of the IPS² lifecycle cost [10], a simplified model should 
be developed to compute IPS² lifecycle cost.

In addition to the main measured IPS² goals, some metrics for the most important 
quality influencing factors must be developed. As IPS² is a combination of products 
and services in the use phase, product and service quality are two essential influen-
cing factors. In the whole IPS² lifecycle, customers and suppliers must work together. 
The cooperation between IPS² customers and suppliers can largely influence the oper-
ation and use of IPS² [4], [16]. Thus, the cooperation quality is the third important 
influencing factor. With the aim of facilitating the analysis and prediction of IPS² 
performance and lifecycle cost, these three influencing factors have been specified as 
follows: 
• Product quality: the quality of key industrial products, e.g. micromachining tools. 
• Service quality: the quality of services associated with key industrial products, e.g. 
operational training, repair, maintenance. 
• Cooperation quality: the quality of cooperation and communication between cus-
tomers and suppliers. 
Based on this concept model, detailed indicators should be defined for IPS². The cate-
gories of indicators are availability, flexibility and lifecycle cost, as well as produce 
quality, service quality and cooperation quality. 
5 
Detailed Indicator Framework for Monitoring IPS² 
In order to define indicators for the indicator framework, relevant references (stan-
dards, books, papers, and dissertations) have been reviewed. Regarding the require-
ments for IPS² monitoring, suitable indicators have been identified and adjusted by 
using brainstorm or Delphi method. Generally, all indicators have been defined in 
accordance with the S.M.A.R.T. principle [17]. According to this principle, all indica-
tors must be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely. 
Figure 2 shows the structure of the developed indicator framework. All indicators 
including their definitions and calculation methods will be described in this chapter. 
5.1 
Availability Indicators  
In the use phase, IPS² availability equals to the availability of its key industrial prod-
uct from the customer’s perspective. Indicators about equipment availability could be 
adopted. With regard to the different criteria of equipment availability, three sub-
indicators are defined for the overall indicator IPS² availability. 
Technical availability: It describes the largest possibility for an IPS² customer to use 
IPS² [18]. It is calculated as the ratio of available production time (key industrial 
product without technical failure) to planned production time within a certain time 
period. 
OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness): An essential expectation for IPS² is high 
productivity. OEE is used to measure the loss of IPS² productivity [19]. OEE has 
three sub indicators: availability rate, performance rate, and quality rate (of the IPS² 
output). Its calculation process is introduced by [19].

• Cost of service processes: It is the cost of all service processes operated by suppli-
ers, including IPS² improvement processes. Without the consideration of their in-
frastructure and spare parts, the cost of these service processes can be simplified as 
the cost of staff and travel. If the cost of service development and prototyping 
should not be ignored, a share of the whole cost should be added to this cost.  
• Cost of infrastructure and spare parts: The cost of infrastructure is the share of the 
cost of the service-related infrastructure for an IPS². The cost of spare parts in-
cludes the cost of any part used to replace damaged parts or to improve IPS² per-
formance. 
Based on this model, three indicators for computing IPS² lifecycle cost have been 
selected: IPS² development cost, service process cost, and cost of product share, 
which can be divided into three sub indicators: cost of key product, share of infra-
structure cost and cost of spare parts. 
5.4 
Product Quality Indicators 
Generally, indicators should be defined to measure the quality of the key industrial 
product of IPS². Function-related quality parameters (e.g. work range, processing 
speed, etc.) are prerequisites to IPS². They must be ignored in the indicator frame-
work. The quality parameters that influence IPS² performance and cost should be 
considered. Hence, three indicators have been defined as the product quality index:  
Reliability: It is the most important quality attribute of the product, which influ-
ences the availability of IPS² directly. Three sub indicators have been defined to de-
scribe machine reliability: TFF (Time to First Failure), MTBF (Mean Time between 
failures), and failure rate [24]. 
Stability: With a highly stable product, IPS² can reach high productivity and gener-
ate more qualified output. The indicator can be calculated using the statistical process 
controlling (SPC) method. 
Feeling quality: It is a qualitative indicator to describe the user’s feeling about the 
product. A user-friendly operation can lead to an easy and safe use of IPS². Several 
criteria can be used to sum up this indicator, e.g. product appearance, ergonomic and 
comfort designing, and safe devices [25]. 
5.5 
Service Quality Indicators  
In the use phase, different services should be offered by IPS² suppliers to improve the 
use of key produce and further to improve IPS² performance. High service quality is 
crucial to achieve the expected high IPS² performance. The SERVQUAL method and 
its five criteria are suitable for the measurement of the service quality of IPS² [26]. 
Instead of original full qualitative measurement, quantitative methods should be 
adopted. These five indicators are: 

318 
M. Abramovici, F. Jin, and H.B. Dang 
 
• Service Reliability: It measures the relationship of the planned and the actual time 
of a service process [27]. 
• Service Assurance: It is a qualitative indicator used to compare the expected and 
the actual result of a service process. 
• Infrastructure: It is defined as to evaluate the invested service infrastructure to 
improve service quality. 
• Team Qualification: It is used to evaluate the qualification of the service teams of 
IPS² suppliers. 
• Responsiveness: It measures the reaction time from the appearance of a service 
requirement to the start of the service process. 
The indicator service quality index can be estimated based on the above five sub-
indicators. The overall service quality over a given time period is the weighted aver-
age quality of all services operated in that time. 
5.6 
Cooperation Quality Indicators 
A successful IPS² requires a closed cooperation between suppliers and customers. To 
quantify the cooperation, two indicators have been defined: 
Degree of information exchange: Cooperation among companies is exchange of in-
formation. This indicator can be measured from the customer’s and supplier’s pers-
pective [28]. 
Compliance with production schedule: Due to competition on the market, IPS² cus-
tomers face challenges to meet an accelerated production schedule. In this case, IPS² 
suppliers should work together with IPS² customers to raise IPS² productivity. The 
cooperation in this situation should be measured. This indicator describes the ratio of 
tasks finished as planned to all production tasks in a given time period. 
6 
A Method for Monitoring IPS² 
For IPS² monitoring, a dashboard should be developed to visualize indicators with 
suitable forms, e.g. tables, trend charts, distribution curves, or visualized traffic lights. 
Going beyond the mere visualization of indicators, risks should be warned as early as 
possible during the IPS² monitoring. 
Generally, risks are considered the appearance of unexpected actual values of indi-
cators in the monitoring process. In order to compare actual and expected values of 
indicators, indicator corridors are used to set expected values visually. A corridor 
consists of the target value, the lower specification limit (LSL), and/or the upper spe-
cification limit (USL). Figure 4 shows different types of corridors. Once the actual 
value crosses the LSL or USL, automated risk warning should ensue. Figure 5 shows 
an example dashboard for the IPS² monitoring by a pilot IPS² supplier.  Indicators are 
structurally visualized in the framework of a virtual balance. A traffic light is illu-
strated to alarm identified risks.

indicator corridors has been introduced. With the help of early warning of risks during 
the IPS² monitoring, decision-makers can analyze risks and make decisions for IPS² 
improvement. 
In the next months, an evaluation of the developed indicator framework will be done 
at a manufacturer of agricultural machines in Germany. This company has begun to offer 
their machines and related services in the use-oriented IPS² business model. By applying 
this indicator framework, the company could monitor their offerings and compare the 
results with his IPS²-related strategies. All objective and subjective feedback on this indi-
cator framework will be collected from its users during the entire evaluation period. By 
using of experience and empirical analysis, this indicator framework will be evaluated 
upon the collected feedback. The structure and indicators of this indicator framework 
could be improved with the focus on the evaluation results. 
Setting up the indicator corridors proposed in the paper could be very difficult and 
time-consuming. Thus, risk warning should be made without indicator corridors, 
when corridors cannot be easily defined. A more intelligent risk warning method 
could be developed in the further, i.e. by using SPC (Statistical process controlling) or 
DEA (Data envelopment analysis). 
In order to allow an easy use of the developed approach to the IPS² monitoring, a 
web-based application, even an app for smart phones or tablets could be developed in 
the future, so that decision-makers can monitor IPS² any place at any time.

Abstract. Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) are socio-technical sys-
tems which provide the customer with a certain function, a promised availabili-
ty or a contracted result rather than a mere physical product. Thus, IPS² 
represent solutions which can be dynamically adapted over the lifecycle in or-
der to meet changing customer requirements and supplier capabilities. On the 
one hand, this poses challenges to the planning and management of resources 
during IPS² delivery. On the other hand, flexibility potentials can be used to ab-
sorb demand peaks and the IPS² supplier has more information about customer 
processes as well as the condition of the IPS² and thus a more profound basis 
for capacity planning. Against this background, the objective of this paper is to 
systematically examine the dynamic influences on capacity requirements of 
service technician workforce for IPS² delivery by means of the System Dynam-
ics (SD) approach as a foundation for further research.  
Keywords: workforce capacity, IPS² delivery, System Dynamics.

Introduction 
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) are integrated value offerings in industrial 
applications, which consist of interdependent product and service shares [1]. Various 
types of business models can be realized through IPS², e.g. with function-, availabili-
ty-, or result-oriented value propositions [2]. Due to the lifecycle-oriented perspective 
on value creation through IPS², the provider’s responsibility does not end with the 
installation of the physical product at the customer’s production site. After planning, 
development and implementation, the delivery of physical and service shares is a key 
success factor as well as a significant expense factor for the provider of the IPS². 
Since the IPS² provider is integrated into the customer’s value chain throughout the 
delivery phase of the IPS², he bears responsibility for the performance of the IPS². 
Depending on the contracted business model, the provider’s ability to maintain a cer-
tain function, availability or result does not merely determine customer satisfaction, 
but may also have a direct impact on the cash flow resulting from revenue streams 
and the cost structure.  
Due to the uno-actu principle, service shares of IPS² cannot be inventoried. Since 
production and consumption of services cannot easily be decoupled, stochastic  

324

volatility in demand directly leads to volatile workload for IPS² delivery [3, 4]. Thus, 
in order to be able to flexibly meet unplanned and unscheduled demand, necessary 
resources for IPS² delivery need to be kept available [5]. The underlying optimization 
problem is based on the well-known trade-off between flexibility and resource utiliza-
tion, which can be modeled by balancing fix costs of idle capacity on the one hand 
and variable costs of compensation payments or losses of customer satisfaction on the 
other hand [6].  
Recently, several publications have addressed the challenge of capacity planning 
for service delivery (e.g. [7], [8]) as well as IPS² delivery (e.g. [9, 10]). However, 
most publications do not take into account the dynamic interdependencies between 
the various factors influencing resource capacity and supply for IPS² or service deli-
very. On the one hand, the triggering events for IPS² delivery occur stochastically and 
can only be predicted to some extent. On the other hand, unlike processing times in 
manufacturing, process times for IPS² delivery are not deterministic and can vary 
significantly depending on various internal and external factors [11]. An important 
internal factor are experience gains and learning effects of the service workforce, 
which are expected to positively influence both quality and process times during IPS² 
delivery [7, 12]. Hence, the objective of this investigation is to model the dynamic 
influences on strategic resource planning with a focus on service workforce capacity 
planning.  
2 
Conceptual Background of Workforce Capacity Planning 
2.1 
Strategic Resource Capacity Planning for IPS² Delivery 
A variety of internal (disposed by provider network) and external resources (disposed 
by customer) are required for the delivery of service shares of IPS². From the perspec-
tive of service engineering research, resources represent the necessary potential (po-
tential dimension) to deliver a service (process dimension) in order to achieve a  
certain result (result dimension). The planning of resources can be considered as an 
ongoing process on various planning levels. Often, three planning levels are distin-
guished: strategic, tactical and operational. These planning levels are interconnected 
by information and feedback loops. In strategic resource planning, the required capac-
ity for IPS² delivery is estimated based on demand forecasts for a long-term planning 
horizon, whereas the allocation of resources to specific tasks is planned in the follow-
ing phases of tactical and operational planning [13–15].  
The capacity of a resource is defined as the task-specific performance capability 
within a given period of time (cp. [16]). This understanding is in accordance with the 
capacity of production systems [17] and has two distinct dimensions to it: 
• Quantitative capacity, representing the number of units of a resource and their 
temporal and spatial availability  
• Qualitative capacity, representing the volume of output of a resource under normal 
operating conditions [16, 18] 
Hence it can be noted that the effective capacity of a resource is context-related, de-
pending on the specific task. Different units of the same type of resource, providing

the same function or result, often perform heterogeneously regarding process time and 
quality for the same task. 
The strategic planning of resource capacity for IPS² delivery must therefore be 
based on the described definition of resource capacity, which claims validity for man-
ufacturing operations, IPS² and service delivery. As indicated above, the planning of 
resources for IPS² delivery involves some challenges which prevent the utilization of 
established methods for production planning and scheduling. External resources, 
which cannot be disposed independently by the IPS² provider, need to be integrated 
into the delivery process. They strongly influence the quantitative and qualitative 
internal resource capacity required for IPS² delivery [8]. In comparison with produc-
tion planning and scheduling, demand forecasting is more difficult and unsecure [14], 
and the delivery times proof to be rather unstable. Recently developed methodologies 
offer possibilities for reducing uncertainties by utilizing IPS²-specific optimization 
potentials and business models [1]. 
2.2 
Workforce Planning for IPS² Delivery 
In order to reduce the complexity of strategic resource planning problems, not all 
resources should be considered equally thoroughly. It is beneficial to focus on those 
resources which are most critical for IPS² or service delivery. For this purpose, [9] 
presents a model for defining the required strategic planning intensity of resources for 
IPS² delivery and [10] introduces a procedure for identifying critical resources on an 
operational level based on actual capacity utilization and process criticality. Another 
possibility to reduce the complexity of the resource planning problem is to aggregate 
different capacity units to work centers or capacity groups, which can be considered 
an entirety for strategic planning purposes [16]. The capacity demand for a work cen-
ter can be derived by calculating the required capacity of a representative resource 
within the work center.  
For IPS² delivery, it is reasonable to consider the service personnel as reference re-
source within each work center since the main focus is usually on the planning of the 
service workforce [7, 14]. Besides logistic costs for optimal stock keeping of spare 
parts and tool management, the workforce of highly qualified field service technicians 
is the greatest cost factor and most important resource to be considered in the strategic 
capacity planning for IPS² delivery – especially in high-wage countries [13]. Other 
resources required for IPS² delivery are either directly related to the number of service 
technicians and thus part of the work center (e.g. standard tools, service vehicle fleet), 
or need to be planned separately on a case-by-case basis (e.g. special tools, spare parts 
and other materials). Because of the key role of the service workforce in IPS² delivery 
planning, this paper will focus on the particular challenges in workforce capacity 
planning. 
2.3 
System Dynamics in Strategic Planning 
System Dynamics (SD) is a method to enhance learning and understanding of com-
plex socio-technical systems, especially in a complex business environment [19]. It is 
thus a suitable tool for analyzing IPS² and the associated dynamic influences on  

326

workforce management. In addition, it is applicable for the simulation of strategic 
problems at high levels of abstraction and provides a way of viewing human systems 
by stressing the importance of certain structural features, such as feedback control 
[20]. By means of qualitative SD modeling, it is possible to get useful insights into the 
operation of workforce systems. Nevertheless, it is often necessary to provide a com-
puter-based simulation model to understand why the modeled system behaves in a 
certain way. Hence, the SD approach is based on simple graphical notations to model 
systems: causal loop diagrams for qualitative analysis (see section 3.1) and stock and 
flow diagrams for quantitative models and simulation (see section 3.2). Especially 
simulations can support the management to find better ways in operating the system 
by demonstrating their consequences [20]. A comprehensive introduction to SD is 
given by Sterman who demonstrates how this method is applied especially to business 
issues [19]. The dynamics of competitive strategy are explored by Warren [21], the 
dynamics of strategy and business dynamics in general are explored by Morecroft 
[22] and Warren [23].

Influences on Required Workforce Capacity in Strategic 
Planning 
There are two perspectives to strategic resource capacity planning for IPS² delivery. 
First, is to identify the required demand for IPS² delivery processes. Second, is to 
calculate the required capacity for meeting this demand [14]. In order to be able to 
generate a quantitative resource planning approach, various influencing factors and 
drivers as well as their dynamic interdependencies need to be analyzed. For this pur-
pose, a qualitative model of the influences on required workforce capacity will be 
presented in the following. The presented model mainly focuses on IPS² delivery in 
the machine tool industry, but it can also be easily adapted for other industrial settings 
of service and IPS² delivery. 
3.1 
Qualitative Model 
The required resource capacity for IPS² delivery, in the following referred to as capac-
ity demand, cannot be determined with certainty. The further the planning horizon, 
the greater the uncertainty of demand forecasts will be. In strategic workforce plan-
ning situations, capacity demand will often have to be estimated for at least one year 
in advance. This is the approximately equivalent time which is needed to strategically 
adjust workforce capacity by hiring and qualifying service technicians for future IPS² 
delivery tasks in technology-intensive industries [13]. As a consequence, the model-
ing and planning approach for strategic resource planning often relies on aggregated 
data since it is not possible to schedule single processes such as installations or cor-
rective maintenance (repair) [14]. Usually, only predetermined maintenance processes 
based on established or contracted time intervals can be planned with sufficient cer-
tainty, but these processes may also be subject to rescheduling in the medium- or 
short-term planning. Thus, aggregation of demand and aggregation of substitutive

(horizontal aggregation) or complementary (vertical aggregation) capacity units to 
work centers or capacity groups are common strategies to reduce complexity with 
acceptable forfeiture of planning accuracy [8, 14].  
If aggregated data is used for strategic capacity management, a quantitative model 
for capacity planning must include the most important influences on capacity demand 
and supply. Capacity demand for IPS² delivery is dependent on the frequency of oc-
currence and the process times of all delivery processes. In the machine tool industry, 
the number of installed machines at customer sites, henceforth referred to as the in-
stalled basis (IB), is expected to be an adequate indicator for the anticipated capacity 
demand, provided that the IB is sufficiently homogenous. Usually, different types of 
machines should be distinguished. This categorization should be based on a qualita-
tive and quantitative assessment of service shares to be delivered for each type of 
machine. The qualitative dimension refers to the types of service processes and the 
internal resources which are needed for the delivery; the quantitative dimension refers 
to the frequency and duration of the delivery processes.  
Especially, the maintenance effort is known to be strongly dependent on the condi-
tion of the physical components of the IPS². A typical failure rate function of technic-
al systems is displayed schematically in Figure 1, showing the technical failure rate 
over the lifecycle of a technical system, e.g. a tool machine. During the early failure 
period (A), material defects or inaccuracies and mistakes during production or instal-
lation become effective. The longest period, the constant failure period (B), is charac-
terized by a relatively low failure rate with random defects. Finally, the failure rate 
increases again during the wear-out failure period (C) which ends with the closure of 
the technical system [24, 25]. 
 
Fig. 1. Schematic failure rate function [24] 
Furthermore, the quality of delivery processes has an impact on capacity demand. 
The mean operating time between failures (MTBF) is influenced by the quality of 
various delivery processes such as maintenance, repair, operator training and process 
optimization. Likewise, operation parameters need to be considered since they may 
have a significant influence on capacity demand. Information for a profound assess-
ment of the condition of the IPS² can be obtained through integrated sensors and con-
dition monitoring software agents [26] and from the IPS²-specific strong integration 
of provider and customer processes (depending on the business model). 
Capacity supply refers to the quantitative and qualitative capacity available for 
IPS² delivery within a particular time period [16]. The quantitative capacity of service

technicians is calculated by subtracting training time, in-house days and other neces-
sary or planned “unproductive” times from the net working time and by cumulating 
this gross operating time over all service technicians. Travel times also need to be 
considered and are to be subtracted from the gross operating time. The net operating 
time represents the quantitative capacity of a service technician within a given period 
of time (cp. Figure 2).  
 
Fig. 2. Working time and operating time of service technicians 
The qualitative capacity of the workforce is characterized by the service techni-
cians’ productivity, which can be measured by evaluating the time needed (input) for 
a certain standard delivery process (output). Training (learning before doing) and 
experience (learning by doing) of the workforce will enable productivity gains with 
positive effects on process times [7, 27]. Furthermore, learning effects are also ex-
pected to increase process quality, which will have a positive effect on the condition 
of the IB and thus reduce future demand for maintenance activities [28]. 
To visualize and understand the feedback structure of the strategic workforce plan-
ning problem, a qualitative model of various factors on capacity supply and demand 
for IPS² delivery is given in Figure 3. This causal loop diagram is intended to be of 
use in understanding the broad structure of the dynamic workforce system. Each link 
in the diagram is represented by an arrow that carries a sign at its head to indicate the 
direction of causality of the link [20]. These links are assigned a polarity, either posi-
tive or negative, to indicate how the dependent variable changes when the indepen-
dent variable changes [19]. Within this causal loop diagram there are feedback loops, 
which can either have a reinforcing (even number of negative polarities) or balancing 
(uneven number of negative polarities) character. In total, nine different feedback 
loops can be identified in the causal loop diagram. The explanation of some examples 
of these loops will help to understand the interdependencies. 
When the number of technicians is increased by hiring personnel, the capacity 
supply increases and thus the hiring of technicians ceases (B1). Equally, an increase 
in the number of technicians allows for a higher specialization of technicians on cer-
tain types of delivery processes. Due to greater specialization, which leads to in-
creased learning effects (technicians’ knowledge and experience), technicians are 
expected to be able to complete deliveries faster (process times), thus increasing ca-
pacity supply through enhanced qualitative capacity (B2). By analogy, hiring of tech-
nicians has a negative effect on technicians’ knowledge and experience which causes 
an increase in delivery process quality. Considering this, the condition of IB increases 
as well, which results in a decreased service demand (R1).

Considering these examples, it becomes obvious that strategic workforce planning 
for IPS² delivery implies complex feedback structures which are important to consider 
for a more detailed quantitative analysis.

Quantitative Sub-model 
SD supports the strategic management in understanding their complex and dynamic 
business. Just as an airline uses flight simulators to help pilots learn, SD is, to a cer-
tain extent, a method for developing computer-based management flight simulators, 
to help managers learn about the dynamic complexity of their business [19]. To be 
able to do this, a quantitative model has to be developed based on the qualitative 
feedback structure discussed in the previous section.  
Causal loop diagrams are well suited to describe interdependencies and feedback 
processes. Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of limitations and can easily be 
abused. A major limitation of causal loop diagrams is their inability to capture the 
stock and flow structure of a system [19]. The main symbols of these stock and flow 
diagrams are shown in Figure 4. Stocks are accumulations and characterize the state

Outflows are represented by a pipe pointing out of the stock. Flow rates are 
represented by a valve on a double line and control the flows. Clouds represent the

In Figure 4, the main part of a SD model of the described strategic planning prob-
lem is illustrated. For the sake of clarity and rationality, this model includes all  
variables from Figure 3 except travel times, training, delivery process quality and 
condition of IB.

Learning in Strategic Planning. Learning effects in industrial settings were first 
investigated by Wright for production processes in the airplane industry [29]. Since 
then, learning effects have been examined in various publications and different indus-
trial settings (cp. [7]). In the quantitative model, learning effects will be included with 
the following equation: 
 
ݕሺ݊ሻൌܽ· ݊ି௕ 
(2) 
Here, y is called the learning and experience factor and denotes the worker efficiency 
after n repetitions of the same processes. a and b represent constants which can be 
adapted in order to scale the learning function. A learning and experience factor of 
90 % means that on average, delivery processes can be executed in 90 % of the target 
time. The number of repetitions (n), which determines the learning and experience 
factor, is mainly influenced by two factors: 
Experience of Technicians. In simplified terms, the experience of technicians is 
expressed by the duration of employment in years. 
Specialization of Technicians. The potential for specialization of the service work-
force is determined by the number of service technicians and by the variability of the 
processes which need to be delivered (cp. Section 3.1). When the number of process 
variants is low compared to the number of available service technicians, then a high 
level of specialization is possible. Thus, service technicians can become experts for 
certain repetitive processes in which they acquire high levels of skill. This effect is 
promoted in large service companies and in cases where service processes have a high 
level of standardization. 
3.3 
Scenario Analysis 
Based on the SD model described in the previous section, a series of simulation runs 
is performed to visualize two different scenarios: 
1. A workforce of 80 service technicians in an established marked with an IB of 2150 
IPS². The growth rate for the next 5 years is around 3 %. 
2. A service provider in an emerging market has 10 experienced service technicians 
to deliver services for 215 IPS² in operation. Growth rates decline from 18,2 % in 
the first year to 13,1 % in the fifth year. 
Figure 5 illustrates these two different scenarios. In the established market with a 
moderate growth rate (scenario 1), significantly more IPS² can be supported per tech-
nician compared to the strongly growing market (scenario 2). The main reason for this 
effect is the high level of acquired skill through experience over time and a greater 
specialization rate in the larger, established market.  
 

332

Fig. 5. Diagram machines per technician and growth rate 
This statement is supported by Figure 6, in which the learning and experience fac-
tors for both scenarios are plotted, together with the average experience. It turns out 
that in both cases the average experience of the service workforce is eight years at the 
beginning (experienced technicians have been sent to support the service team in the 
emerging regional market in scenario 2). 
 
Fig. 6. Learning and experience diagram 
However, due to the hiring of many inexperienced technicians, which is necessary 
to meet the rapidly increasing demand, the average experience drops from 8 years to 6 
years in scenario 2. Besides higher levels of specialization, further economies of scale 
are to be expected in large service organizations and well-organized IPS² provider 
networks. For example travel times, which have not yet been considered in the quan-
titative SD model, will decrease when the IB and the service workforce grow (cp. 
Section 3.1).

Summary and Outlook 
In this paper, some of the most import influence factors on workforce capacity plan-
ning for IPS² delivery have been identified. The dynamic interdependencies of these 
factors have been described qualitatively using a causal loop diagram. Based on the 
quantitative analysis, an initial stock flow diagram has been developed in a SD model. 
The objective of this quantitative SD model was to give a hint about the implications 
of the interdependencies in the form of a conceptual case study based on two different 
scenario settings. Further research will aim at refining the quantitative model and 
incorporating all aspects described in the qualitative causal loop diagram. Further-
more, aspects of organizational learning beyond the individual’s experience-based 
learning curve as well as the customer’s influence and learning effects will be ana-
lyzed. Finally, the model needs to be evaluated in a real industrial setting.

Abstract. The approach of the IPS² factory management faces the challenges to 
deliver IPS². A framework of process steps for the planning, development and 
use of an IPS² leads to a structured acquisition of necessary processes and activ-
ities on the IPS² provider’s and customer’s site to procure and operate a produc-
tion system. 
The development of the generic framework for the IPS² factory management 
bases on a literature research. Therefore processes and activities of the factory 
planning as well as for the factory management were concerned. The identified 
processes and activities were aggregated and assigned to the IPS² life cycle 
phases by the chronological arranging under consideration of the activities’ in- 
and output. By varying the responsibility of different process steps, concrete 
customer-provider-relationships were presented. This approach enables the se-
lection and arrangement of product and service shares in the early life cycle 
phases for the customer and IPS² provider. 
Keywords: IPS² development, factory management, factory planning.

Introduction 
The approach of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) focuses on the integration 
of product and service shares. Thus, the IPS² provider assumes responsibility for 
process steps within the procurement and operation of machine tools to support the 
customer and increase its benefit. 
To face this challenge an overview of deliverable service shares in the production 
area has to be achieved, so the IPS² provider is able to deal with production factors, 
i. e. time, costs, quality, and risks. Therefore a process map with processes of factory 
management, factory planning, and methodical designing shall be developed. The 
development of this IPS² factory management will be presented in this paper. In the 
framework of the IPS² factory management, the possible range of processes, which 
are necessary to procure and to operate a machine tool, is arranged. Subsequently the 
description of interfaces between the IPS² provider, customer, and network partners 
allows the control and assessment of customer-provider relationships in the early 
phase of an IPS², which is the further goal of the IPS² factory management approach. 
To demonstrate the current application of the IPS² factory management the arranging 
of processes for the supply of milling tools to increase the organizational availability 
of a machine tool will be presented.

Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS²) 
2.1 
Definition 
Industrial Product-Service Systems consists of tangible products and intangible ser-
vice shares over an entire IPS² lifecycle. The IPS² provider develops and delivers 
customized solutions to fulfill various customer requirements [1-3]. Offering IPS² 
leads to new possibilities of business models [4]. 
2.2 
Lifecycle 
The main lifecycle phases of an IPS² are [5]: 
• IPS² planning 
• IPS² development 
• IPS² implementation 
• IPS² operation 
• IPS² closure 
The IPS² planning phase starts with the first customer contact. In a second step of the 
IPS² planning the customer requirements are identified by the IPS² provider. The IPS² 
planning phase ends with an offer for a customer specific IPS². This is based on a 
requirements list and is connected to a customized IPS² business model. 
A functional and conceptual model of the IPS² is generated in the IPS² develop-
ment phase. The needed IPS² function can be realized by service shares, product 
shares or as a module with a combination of both types.  
In the IPS² implementation phase, which follows the development, the IPS² with all 
product and service shares is built up. 
The main characteristic of the subsequent IPS² operation phase is the parallelism of 
the use of the IPS² product share and the delivery of the IPS² service shares. In this 
phase, the IPS² creates value and the processes of the IPS² service shares are supplied. 
The IPS² closure phase follows the contractual run time. In this phase the product 
shares are removed and the delivery of service shares is stopped. 
2.3 
Business Models 
In the context of IPS², the customer-provider relationships lead to new possibilities of 
business models, due to the wider range of customizing product and service shares. 
Three exemplary IPS² business models are the function-oriented, the availability-
oriented and the result-oriented business model [4], [6]. 
Function-Oriented IPS² Business Model. Within the function-oriented IPS² business 
model the IPS² provider distributes a machine tool and ensures its function. The cus-
tomer is responsible for the operation of the machine tool. Considering the lifecycle 
phases, the IPS² provider offers additional service shares in the use phase, e. g. main-
tenance processes, staff training or supply of auxiliaries. The customer is responsible 
for the ordering of the additional service shares. 
Availability-Oriented IPS² Business Model. In this IPS² business model the IPS² pro-
vider guarantees a defined availability of the machine tool. Therefore it has to be distin-
guished which kind of downtime is in the IPS provider’s responsibility and which is in

the customer’s. Additional measures to maintain the specified degree of availability are 
necessary. Therefore the IPS² provider can equip the machine with sensors for condition 
monitoring to minimize the probability of sudden failures. A proactive detection of a 
critical process situation will enable the IPS² provider to trigger a repair measure during 
planned downtime. In this way the availability of the machine tool will not be affected 
negatively. An efficient communication is necessary between the IPS² provider and the 
customer to ensure the efficient planning of maintenance processes. 
Result-Oriented IPS² Business Model. In this IPS² business model the IPS² provider 
assumes the overall responsibility for the production work pieces. The production risk 
shifts from the customer to the IPS² provider, as the customer only pays for properly 
produced parts, in contrast to a function oriented business model. To minimize the 
risks in this IPS² business model the IPS² provider needs an IPS² network to overcome 
possible unforeseen production failures. 
3 
Goals for the IPS² Factory Management 
Enabling machine tool manufacturers to offer IPS², the influences of the integrated 
approach of product and service shares have to be considered. IPS² providers have to 
expand their scope of performance to fulfill the increased service level. Therefore the 
following challenges exist: 
• Taking over of responsibilities and thereby risks for machine tool availability or 
the result of the machine tools’ production processes according to the IPS² business 
models. 
• Creation and organization of IPS² networks to realize the wide range of possible 
customer requirements. 
• Customizing the level of performance according to the individual customer re-
quirements. 
The IPS² factory management will be developed as a framework to arrange the neces-
sary processes to fulfill the wide range of customer requirements. Its application takes 
place in the early phases of an IPS² to deliver an overview about the wide range of 
possible processes, which the IPS² provider can take responsibility for in the produc-
tion area. Thus, the definition of interfaces between IPS² provider, customer, and 
network partners for all IPS² lifecycle phases shall be enabled. Additionally, the mod-
ularization of process steps increases the ability to react on changing customer re-
quirements efficiently and simplifies the comparison of different IPS² alternatives. 
In the following the proceeding for the development of the IPS² factory manage-
ment will be presented. Afterwards the application of the IPS² factory management 
will be demonstrated and exemplary performed.

Development of the IPS² Factory Management 
To ensure the ability of machine tool manufacturer to deliver IPS², the IPS² factory 
management is a generic process map for the planning, development, implementation, 
operation and closing of IPS² for the production of industrial goods. 
The development of the IPS² factory management was conducted in four steps: 

338 
E. Uhlmann, C. Gabriel, and C. Stelzer 
 
1. Literature research of existing approaches for factory planning, factory manage-
ment, and methodical designing in order to identify necessary tasks in the produc-
tion area for the IPS² factory management. 
2. Description of the identified processes and activities under considering of the iden-
tified tasks for the IPS² factory management. 
3. Determination of the in- and outputs of the developed processes and activities. 
4. Arrangement of the processes and activities in a process map for the IPS² factory 
management by means of the in- and outputs. 
4.1 
Literature Research 
The task of the factory management is widely seen as the planning, controlling, and mon-
itoring of processes and activities to ensure the production of products [7], [8]. To devel-
op and deliver IPS², this consideration has to be extended. The IPS² provider cannot  
focus exclusively on the production of products but has to overtake responsibility for 
processes at the customer’s site, too. Therefore, factory planning as well as methodical 
designing approaches were taken into account additionally within the literature research.

The research of the literature, listed in Table 1, delivers a wide range of necessary 
tasks in the production area. In the following step these tasks were considered to build 
up processes for the IPS² factory management. The processes have to be mutually 
exclusive and represent the whole range of necessary tasks to manufacture parts with 
machine tools. 
4.2 
Identified Processes 
The result of the literature research is an overview of tasks, which are described in the 
approaches of factory planning, factory management and methodical designing. To 
fulfill these tasks several activities have to be executed. According to the literature, 
processes can be characterized as presented in Figure 1. Thus, a process is a sequence 
of mutual influencing activities with a beginning, an end, and defined in- and outputs 
[19-22]. Applied to the field of factory management, the process steps relevant to IPS² 
were distinguished and listed in the appendix. 
 
Fig. 1. Structure of a process according to [19] 
As an example the task planning of factory location, according to Grundig [11], see 
Table 1, will be separated in three process steps: 
• Setting location requirements 
• Identifying and describing locations 
• Selecting location 
4.3 
Build-Up of Processes 
In the following step the identified processes for the IPS² factory management were 
built up and detailed according to the introduced process characterization in Chapter 
4.2. 
Representatively for all identified processes, the process ‘Selecting machine tool’ 
shall be explained in detail, see Figure 2. The output of this process is the decision of 
appropriate machine tools for a production order. Therefore the ideal sequence of 
manufacturing processes for a work piece has to be known, e. g. sawing, turning, and 
milling. For all manufacturing processes, a machine tool will be selected. Additional-
ly, the process owner needs an overview of available machine tools and their

lot size, the material and geometry of the work pieces, and the planned working dura-
tion, the appropriate machine tools will be selected. 
4.4 
Arrangement of the Processes and Activities According to the In- and 
Outputs 
By identifying the in- and outputs, the processes will be arranged in the form of a 
process map. Thereby it has to be differentiated between sequential and parallel 
processes. This will be shown exemplary for the already mentioned process ‘Selecting 
machine tool’, see Figure 3. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Systematic for the arrangement of processes 
As already mentioned, the process owner needs the information about the available 
machine tools and the ideal sequence of the manufacturing process. This information 
is the output of the processes identifying machine work load and defining process

sequence. For the process map, this implies that these processes can be parallelized 
and it is a necessary prerequisite that these processes were finished before the process 
‘Selecting machine tool’ starts. 
Executing this systematic procedure for every process identified in chapter 4.2, a 
process map combining all possible processes arises. A section of the existing process 
map is shown exemplary in Figure 4. The thematic width of the IPS² factory man-
agement, while developing the process map, is visible due to the arisen areas in the 
process map. One benefit of this approach for structuring processes to deliver IPS² is 
the considering of the interactions between the different areas. Additionally the 
process map enables the structuring of the entire level of performance, which the IPS² 
provider delivers his customers. For developing concrete customer-provider-
relationships, the IPS² provider tailors the process map, to choose the necessary 
processes for fulfilling the customer requirements. 
 
Fig. 4. Section of the process map 
The process map covers the whole range of possible steps while integrating a ma-
chine tool into a production line. The range of necessary effort for building up and 
integrating a machine tool can be separated into three cases: 
1. Developing and integrating a new machine tool into a consisting production line 
under consideration of the supply of auxiliaries or the development of appropriate 
boundary conditions. 
2. Adaption of a production line by changing the layout and material flow to integrate 
a new machine tool. 
3. Planning and realization of a new factory building to develop a new production 
plant with the IPS² provider’s machine tools. 
4.5 
Approach for the Use of the IPS² Factory Management 
After describing the development of the IPS² factory management, the approach for 
its use shall be introduced, Figure 5. Enabling a machine tools manufacturer to deliver 
IPS², the process map has to be introduced. For this, the process map shall represent 
the IPS² provider’s and network partner’s whole scope of performance. After intro-
ducing the process map, concrete customer-provider-relationships will be described, 
due to the customizing of the process map. For this the responsibilities for single 
process steps have to be defined between the IPS² provider, his network partners, and 
the customer, according to the identified customer requirements. The structured

representation of necessary process steps allows the control and detailing of the 
workflows on the IPS² provider’s site under consideration of the available resources, 
time, costs and risks. After detailing the necessary process steps the realization of the 
IPS² starts. During delivering product and service shares as an IPS², the gained expe-
riences lead to an optimization of the process map. 
 
Fig. 5. Approach for the use of the IPS² Factory Management

Use of the IPS² Factory Management 
As an example the use of the IPS² factory management shall be presented for the or-
ganization of milling tools within an IPS² [23]. The determinations of appropriate 
cutting data as well as the on time delivery of milling tools are two main influences to 
increase the effectiveness of a milling machine tool. Considering the OEE key figure, 
which is the product of a machine tool’s availability, efficiency and quality [24], the 
process step determining cutting data influences the efficiency and the process step 
delivering tools influences the organizational availability. 
In this example the IPS² provider is responsible for the selection and delivery of 
milling tools. Therefore information of process steps on the customer’s site are neces-
sary. The process step ‘Creating manufacturing documents’ delivers the geometry 
information, which are important for the selection of the milling tool’s type and size. 
Additionally the information about the work piece material influences the milling 
tool’s material or coating as well as the cutting data. The next process step ‘Determin-
ing demand of work pieces’ leads to the information about the number of units and the 
delivery date of work pieces. Therefore, it effects the amount and delivery date of the 
milling tools. Within the ‘Planning of operations’ the machine tool will be defined, 
which influences the fixing of the milling tool. Additionally the operation planning 
allows the determination of the cutting volume and thereby the estimation of the ne-
cessary tool life. 
Under consideration of these information the IPS² provider selects the appropriate 
milling tools, their amount, and delivery date and chooses the optimized cutting data

in accordance with the supplier of the milling tools. This network partner assumes the

Summary 
Within this paper the development and the application of the IPS² factory manage-
ment were described. The development based on a literature research and a methodol-
ogy, which considers the in- and outputs of processes described in different fields of 
the production area. Additionally an approach for the introduction of the IPS² factory 
management was presented, to enable or support machine tool manufacturers while 
becoming an IPS² provider. 
For the further development of the IPS² factory management, the process steps will 
be added with attributes and resources. Under consideration of concrete customer 
requirements the sequence of the necessary process steps are describable. On the basis 
of this description the responsibilities were distributed between the IPS² provider, 
customer, and network partners. Under consideration of the associated attributes and 
necessary resources different varieties of concrete IPS² for customers can be simu-
lated and rated in terms of time, costs, quality and risk.

Abstract. The continuous monitoring and documentation of the condition of 
wear-susceptible components is the prerequisite for condition-based mainten-
ance in availability-oriented IPS² business models. This article illustrates the 
concept of intelligent condition monitoring for mechatronic components. To en-
sure a real time and precise detection of condition deterioration a toolbox was 
developed and implemented in MATLAB that combines methods for signal 
processing, feature extraction and classification. A test rig is introduced that 
was designed and built for the purpose of roller bearing monitoring. Since roller 
bearings are the most critical components of a micro milling spindle, they are 
responsible for a multiplicity of machine tool breakdowns. The toolbox was 
evaluated in experiments with the roller bearing test rig.  
Keywords: Availability-oriented IPS² business models, Condition Monitoring,

Introduction 
Condition Monitoring is vital to availability-oriented IPS² business models. The abili-
ty to react to spontaneously arising demands for technical service activities necessi-
tates a well-functioning condition monitoring system. In the context of IPS²,  
approaches exist to utilize a network of qualified service providers in order to fulfill 
such demands for the machine tool industry [1, 2]. 
In the most favorable case, such sudden occurrences of demands for technical ser-
vices should be anticipated by detecting the deterioration of critical components. This 
can be achieved by suitable proactive maintenance strategies. These can range from 
regular manual inspections over the logging and processing of alarm messages of the 
machine control to sensor-based condition monitoring.  
However, for a condition monitoring system to reliably distinguish between a 
properly functioning component and one that is about to fail, the acquired sensor sig-
nals need to be processed, meaningful signal features need to be extracted and classi-
fied so that a conclusion can be drawn about the actual state of the component.  
In the framework of this article, a toolbox will be introduced that enables produc-
tion engineers, who are not experts in the field of signal processing and analysis, to 
create condition monitoring applications in an intuitive and effective manner.

Subsequently, this toolbox will be evaluated with sensor data acquired at a test rig for 
roller bearings. Different characteristic damages will be generated in roller bearings, 
subsequently these bearings will be operated under varying conditions. The recorded 
sensor signal will serve as input for the toolbox and its feature extraction and classifi-
cation functions. At last, the results will be assessed by applying the classification 
results to new sensor data.

State of the Art  
2.1 
IPS² 
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) provide means of market differentiation 
and continuous revenue throughout the whole IPS² lifecycle for companies in indu-
strialized nations. Especially when looking at the pace at which technological stan-
dards in the emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil are rising, the proper 
connection of product and service shares is found to be a useful market differentiation 
strategy. There are various possibilities of offering service shares generating customer 
benefit by increasing the performance of the product share. This new and innovative 
form of business is particularly interesting for manufacturers of complex and capital-
intensive goods such as plants and machine tools. There exists a high demand on cus-
tomer side for accompanying service shares due to: 
• 
The complexity of the sold product share, 
• 
The customer’s need to substitute product with service shares or vice versa in 
order to react flexibly to deviations in the companies’ boundary conditions, 
• 
The possibility to outsource tasks that are outside the customer’s core competen-
cy or not creating value.  
A popular characterization of different IPS² business models distinguishes between 
function-, availability- and result-oriented business models [3, 4]. Although every 
business model is customer-specific and thus, highly individual, these business model 
categories are often used as they are particularly characteristic. In an availability-
oriented business model, the IPS² provider guarantees the technical availability of the 
IPS² product share. Downtime of the product share, e. g. a machine tool, directly re-
sults in a financial loss. Therefore, any failure of the system should be recognized 
immediately or better, beforehand, in order to be fixed to prevent any financial loss 
and fulfill the customer requirement. Condition-based maintenance therefore is a key 
solution to this challenge.  
2.2 
Maintenance Strategy 
Maintenance is considered as the “combination of all technical, administrative and 
managerial actions during the life cycle of an item intended to retain it in, or restore it 
to, a state in which it can perform the required function” [5]. Independent of the tech-
nical details of the maintenance and monitoring solutions, maintenance strategies can

be distinguished according to general concepts. Most commonly, the forms reactive 
and proactive maintenance can be differentiated. Within preventive maintenance, a 
further distinction can be made between periodically preventive, condition-based and 
anticipatory preventive maintenance [5]. For a further distinction within reactive as 
well as proactive maintenance strategies, see [6].  
Whereas theoretically, all of these strategic concepts would enable the IPS² provid-
er to keep up availability in IPS² business models, the advantages that apply to the 
preventive maintenance strategies are of crucial importance when the availability-
oriented ISP² business model implies severe fees and absent revenues during machine 
tool downtime.  
The three introduced preventive maintenance strategies differ in the way in which 
maintenance activities are triggered: Whereas in the periodically preventive strategy 
maintenance activities are executed according to fixed usage intervals such as time 
periods, usage hours, traveled (covered) distance, etc., the other two strategies trigger 
their activities on the actual condition of the machine or component. In the condition-
based strategy, maintenance activities are initiated upon changes in the condition of 
function critical components. The approach is based on the assumption of progressive 
degradation [7] of a component. By acquiring the condition-relevant parameters of the 
component constantly or in fixed intervals, the progress of deterioration is computed 
and countermeasures can be arranged accordingly.  
Despite the clear advantages of condition-based maintenance, however, this strate-
gy imposes the challenge of reliably determining the actual wear state of the compo-
nent. Also, if the assumed, constant progress of degradation is interrupted by a  
spontaneous event due to misuse or spontaneous material failure, the maintenance 
strategy must be able to react to these unscheduled demands as quickly as possible. 
The anticipatory maintenance strategy differs from the condition-based in the pur-
pose of aiming at “hidden” failures that are not detectable by acquiring condition-
relevant parameters. 
2.3 
Monitoring of Roller Bearings  
As an important requirement for condition-based maintenance activities in the frame-
work of availability-oriented IPS² business models, sufficient means of online moni-
toring have to be available.  
Online monitoring of critical components such as roller bearings provides informa-
tion about the current state of deterioration of the component. Generally, different 
types of parameters can be monitored The most widely used include performance, 
vibration, motor stator current, shock pulse, acoustic emission, thermography and the 
detection of wear debris [8]. They differ in the underlying sensor concept and thus, 
their characteristics regarding sensitivity, robustness, sampling rate and cost. In the 
context of this paper, means of sensor-based condition monitoring will be presented 
that enable IPS² provider companies to react to degradation.  
Generally, two different approaches of processing sensor data can be distinguished. 
On the one hand, diagnostic models can be used that resemble the actual physical 
phenomenon to a maximum possible extent. In the case of roller bearings, such  

350 
E. Uhlmann, A. Laghmouchi, and N. Raue 
models would take into account exact material, geometrical and operational parame-
ters that apply to the bearing to be monitored [9]. On the other hand, statistical me-
thods can be applied that are based on training data and are specific for the material, 
geometrical and operational conditions the training data set was acquired under [10]. 
The first approach is often referred to as white-box, whereas the latter as black-box 
approach [11]. The method toolkit considers both approaches to a certain extent: on 
the one hand, features in the frequency domain such as damage frequencies resemble 
the physical buildup of the component, other features such as the time domain fea-
tures serve as input for the classifiers introduced later.

Condition Monitoring Toolbox 
3.1 
Requirements for the Condition Monitoring Toolbox 
A software tool was developed for the interactive generation of algorithms in the pro-
gramming environment MATLAB. The implemented algorithms are to be used for 
development of concrete condition monitoring applications which follow a general 
functional sequence (Fig. 1).  
For the implementation of condition monitoring applications for complex ma-
chines, plants and systems, different data is logged and evaluated. There might be 
machines and plants that may consist of several parts subject to wear. Generally, the 
assemblies and components which are to be monitored exist in a wide range of ma-
chines and plants, such as gearboxes, roller bearings, and shafts. However, differences 
exist between these types of parts, in particular in the mode of load stress. Therefore 
methods and algorithms have to be easily adaptable for analysis and evaluation of the 
condition of the machine or its components. As a result of the requirements to the 
software, it is possible to load and plot data with different formats. Besides physical 
data, such as vibration, pressure, etc., also several types of alarm messages and sys-
tem-internal information can be stored and used for an improved analysis. Various 
methods are additionally available to the user through all steps of the development 
(signal processing, feature extraction and classification).  
After finishing the development steps (signal processing, feature extraction and 
classification) the complete algorithm can be exported as a separate MATLAB m-file. 
It is envisaged that a vector with percentage probabilities is generated as the output 
for the classification algorithm. That implies that the vector elements indicate the 
likelihood with which assigned defect classes match the analyzed measurement data.  
The functional requirements which are given above are realized in a graphical user 
interface (GUI). Users have the possibility to control and to flexibly manipulate the 
program execution. Additionally, the program can be handled intuitively. The soft-
ware is implemented in a form that allows additions (self-implemented methods and 
other algorithms combination) which can be directly linked to the tool via the GUI. 
Interface specifications ensure the error-free integration of the additional methods into 
the tool. As opposed to conventional approaches, the developed tool offers more new 
functions, components and methods to be implemented by the user. Additional infor-
mation, such as system alarm and system internal messages can even be used for the 
improvement of classification results.

Structure of the Toolbox  
Analogously to the general sequence of a pattern recognition system, Fig. 2 illustrates 
the modules of the toolbox in their sequence of function. The development of a spe-
cific condition monitoring application requires several steps. The details to the devel-
opment steps are described below.  
 
Fig. 1. Modules of the Toolbox (Following [12]) 
Data Input  
A variety of data formats can be imported into the tool, such as .mat, .csv, xls, txt, etc. 
Previously acquired sensor data can be imported, processed and analyzed for classifi-
cation purposes. The circumstances, under which the training data set was recorded, is 
important for characterizing the resulting classification of the extracted features. 
Signal Processing  
Generally, measurement signals include measurement noise, process noise and distur-
bances. Therefore the raw signal must be prepared so that relevant information and 
signal parts, which can be used for condition monitoring, are extracted. This requires 
a preprocessing of the raw signal before extracting the features (diagnostic parame-
ters). Signal filtering and signal norming are an essential part of signal processing. 
The tool allocates the different methods for the signal processing step, such as high-
pass filter, low-pass filter, etc.   
Feature Extraction  
The basis of the reliable detection of parameter changes compared to the normal con-
dition of the component is the generation of crucial characteristics (fault symptoms) 
which are suited to monitor component state. The fault symptoms can be detected 
through analysis and evaluation methods of measured data.    
For an investigation of the deviation of a physical variable to the normal condition 
there are several approaches (methods and algorithms) for feature extraction and early 
fault detection. All methods follow however the same underlying idea. Relevant cha-
racteristics of the component condition should be determined from records with 
knowledge about the plant. The features can be different, consequently the directly 
measurable values, such as temperature or pressure or the values which can be ex-
tracted from the measurement signals, such as frequencies or statistic values. 
In the tool, the user can choose statistic values (mean, RMS value, variance, kurto-
sis and skewness of distribution), spectral values, cepstral values and envelope curve 
values. The selected characteristics are described in the following:

Classification  
For the classification of the feature that has been extracted from the preprocessed raw 
signal, methods of computational intelligence can be used in addition to the statistical 
classification methods. These methods have the task of allocating the defect classes to 
the feature. The evaluation of the classification methods requires detailed studies, to 
maintain the safe and reliable functioning of the selected methods by using them for 
various applications. Through extensive measurements of different states of the com-
ponent, the parameterization of the algorithms can be analyzed.

In addition to the above mentioned features which can be extracted from the sensor 
signals for condition monitoring, the system internal information and alarms can be 
used through cluster analysis (data mining) to detect patterns. These patterns can be 
used to further optimize the condition monitoring of the considered component. In the 
developed toolbox are various algorithms are included. The implemented algorithm is 
explained in the following:  
Naive Bayes Classifier. 
The Bayesian classifier appertains to the group of statistical classifiers. The classifier 
can forecast class belonging probabilities, such as the probability that a observed data 
appertains to a particular class. This classifier is based on the “Bayesian theorem” and 
is particularly appropriate when the dimensionality of the input is high. 
Fig. 2 illustrates the classification results of the various roller bearing tests with the 
Nearest Neighbor Classifier algorithm. The classification issue depends on the as-
sortment of the classification algorithm with the parameter used. In practice, there is 
no general procedure to identify the optimal features, therefore the calculation of the 
features is still conducted empirically.

Experimental Setup 
A test rig was deployed in order to evaluate the toolbox with sensor data of roller 
bearings in operation. The test rig enables the acquisition of several condition relevant

sensor signals, namely temperature, vibration and acoustic emission. For the evalua-
tion of the toolbox, vibration data was used. A Bruel&Kjaer 4518-003 piecoelectric 
accelerometer, which is inserted into the sensor mount of the bearing block, was ap-
plied to acquire vibration data. Through a National Instruments cDAQ module that 
supports IEPE (Integrated Electronics Piezo Electric) sensors, the vibration signal was 
acquired and recorded by a program developed in the LabVIEW environment. Data 
sets of two seconds were recorded using a sampling rate of 25 kHz. For this evalua-
tion, the bearings were operated at a rotational speed of 1800 rpm.

Generation of Damage Patterns 
Fig. 4 (left) illustrates the roller bearing of type 6000 from the manufacturer SKF, 
which was used to generate real measurement data on the ball-bearing test rig. Vari-
ous types of damages in different positions on the roller bearings have been created 
for evaluation of the developed toolbox.  
The damage types on the roller bearings were generated via electrical discharge 
machining (EDM).  The eroding process was repeated sequentially (several eroding 
holes) so that a large enough crater was generated and a form similarity to the real 
damage was reached. During operation of the damaged bearing, repeated impacts 
cause vibration that is transmitted through the surface of the whole machine. In the 
test rig, these vibrations are detected by the piezoelectric accelerometer.  
The most prevalent faults on the ball-bearing were identified on the basis of the li-
terature research [15]. The following error classes were created.  
I. 
Rolling element damage  
Failure on the rolling element generated through an electrode with a diameter 
of 200 µm.  
II. 
Small damage on the outer ring 
Damage on the outer ring of the ball-bearing generated through an electrode 
with a diameter of 200 µm. 
III.

Damage on the outer ring of the ball-bearing generated through an electrode 
with a diameter of 400 µm. 
IV.

with a diameter of 200 µm.

Results 
For the evaluation of the classification procedure, five features (Mean, RMS, Va-
riance, Kurtosis, Skewness) were applied to three classifiers. The results achieved 
depend strongly on the selected feature and used algorithms. There are no special 
procedures for selecting and calculating the features which are suitable for an optimal 
classification. The varying results of the classification are depending on the algorithm. 
Table 1 illustrates the percentage of the unknown data that have been correctly as-
signed to the training data. The algorithm that based on Mahanalobis distance (equa-
tion 1) calculates the distance between two points in a multidimensional space. The 
Mahalanobis distance [16] of the vectors 
1x  and
2x  in a multidimensional space is

The failure type “IV: Damage on the inner ring” is not successfully classified. This 
is most likely due to the similarity with the measured data of the failure type “I: Roll-

distinction and thus overlap in the feature space. The selection of other features, par-
ticularly from the frequency domain, could support the classification despite the close 
resemblance between the data of the two classes.

Summary and Outlook 
In the framework of this article, a Toolbox was introduced to create condition moni-
toring applications in an intuitive and efficient way. Subsequently, the method toolkit 
was evaluated using a test rig for roller bearings. Therefore, specific damages were 
applied to sample roller bearings, which were operated while a vibration signal was 
recorded under defined operation conditions. The resulting damage classifications 
were assessed by test runs with bearings from the corresponding damage classes.

In the context of IPS², the developed tool can help provider companies of machine 
tool-related IPS² to improve the reliability of their condition assessment and thus the 
execution of their maintenance strategy. Engineers, who are responsible for the opera-
tion of the IPS² at the provider company are able to create reliable condition monitor-
ing applications without expert knowledge about the computational background of the 
classification process.  
One advancement of the tool will include the consideration of further classifiers, 
such as neural networks. The flexibility of the Method Kit regarding the sensor input 
furthermore allows the classification for the wear assessment of different mechatronic 
components such as bearings, gear wheels and milling spindles.

Abstract. Services offer a great innovation potential due to their adaptability to 
individual customer problems. Though, many companies meet the challenge to 
consider customer-driven innovation ideas in a way that market-ready services 
match the customers’ needs. As a result, a significant number of industrial ser-
vice innovations fail and the required level of service quality and productivity 
cannot be assured constantly. Instruments are needed, which allow for identify-
ing, analyzing and evaluating the risks and opportunities that come along with 
the development of innovative services. Therefore an approach has been devel-
oped that allows companies in a simple way to identify, analyze and evaluate 
potential risks that arise in the implementation of innovative ideas. Thus com-
panies are enabled to decide on a profound basis, which innovations are promis-
ing to be successful in the market and should be prioritized. Furthermore the 
identified risks can constantly be considered during the service engineering 
process, the service implementation and the service delivery.

Introduction 
An even more intense and global competition demands innovative problem solving in 
even shorter periods of time and for less costs. In this context innovations become a 
key factor of economic development and growth [1][2]. Especially the increasing 
dynamic of the global market and the rising complexity of the corporate environment 
indicate that a professional innovation management is essential [3]. Companies are 
forced to differentiate themselves from competitors with products and services of 
comparable quality. A company that is able to assert itself effectively by increasing 
market share, revenue and profit in a market, which is characterized by competitive-
ness, is therefore defined as successful and innovative [4]. The implementation of 
innovations, however, is associated not only with new opportunities, but also with 
risks. Unidentified risks can cause serious consequences. For instance, if the costs for 
development and market launch are not recouped, innovations can endanger

companies substantially. In addition, warranty and goodwill costs as well as a huge 
loss of reputation can occur, which can effect further costs for the company [3][5]. 
Against that background, companies must be constantly vigilant about the chances 
and risks at different fields of the business environment. 
Due to the fact that customers are not willing to accept compromises with regard to 
the quality requirements, a decisive factor for the competitiveness of service provid-
ing companies is the concatenation of innovation and service quality [5-7]. Depending 
on the industrial sector 30-50% of all new introduced services turn out to be a failure; 
respectively they do not match the expectations of the service provider. This often 
leads to an overreaction like for example removing them directly from the market [8]. 
The misinterpreted and ignored changes of boundary conditions, which influence the 
customer acceptance for new innovations, can be a cause for the failure of innova-
tions. Besides the inadequate fulfillment of the customers’ demands due to the lack of 
customer orientation, the capacity overload of companies, which have to handle too 
many projects in parallel, can be as well a reason for the unsuccessful implementation 
of new innovations [5]. In many companies, there exists no systematical development 
of service innovations [9]. They are often evolved accidently and just arise ad hoc 
based on feelings or intuition. This implementation follows the idea that services are 
easier to develop than physical goods. Thus, the complexity of the innovative service 
development is systematically ignored [10][11]. Based on the increasing globalization 
of markets the conditions for decision-relevant information alters more often. As a 
result a constant adapted perception of the success potentials for the innovation man-
agement is also becoming more important.  
Both product-related services and services that are sold independently of a product 
are playing a more and more decisive economic role for companies [12]. Therefore 
and due to the adaptability of individual solutions to customer problems, the service 
sector provides a strong innovation potential. Related to this, however, many compa-
nies are confronted with the problem of considering both their own and the customer-
driven innovation ideas in their development process of new services. For choosing 
the best fitting innovation idea out of the abundance in consideration of their com-
plexity, the companies have to prioritize and decide for or against an innovation idea. 
Companies proceed, as already mentioned above, not systematically enough and part-
ly unprofessional during the development and design of their offered service. New 
services arise rarely as a result from rational strategic consideration and systematic 
development processes, but rather from historical grown situations or accidental 
available opportunities [13]. Thereby sometimes profitable ideas are rejected and 
ideas which are doomed to fail are pursued. Such wrong decisions cost companies 
considerable time and money [14]. 
Taking the aforementioned into consideration, it is the central objective of the  
presented approach to allow for a preventive quality management by identifying, 
analyzing and evaluating potential risks that arise in the implementation of service 
innovation ideas on a simple way.

Service Quality and Risks 
2.1 
Service Quality 
The quality of services is a key success factor for companies. Recent studies show, that 
both the customer’s purchasing decision for a product and the company’s profit are influ-
enced decisively by the quality of the accompanying service [12]. In this context it gets 
increasingly important for a service provider to recognize that a competitive profiling is 
possible only by a consistent customer orientation, which is able to adapt to the target 
markets [15][16]. Thereby, the quality leadership has to be understood as the central 
strategy of success for gaining or rather defending a competitive edge [17]. 
Many services are developed in close interaction of customers and the employees 
of the service provider. Therefore especially in the service sector an intact, interper-
sonal information flow determines the competitiveness of the service provider [18]. A 
service provider, which is able to create a primary immaterial service that fits to the 
customer’s expectations on a certain specified level of requirement, owns the capa-
bility to create service quality. The service quality is therefore determined by the rate 
of compliance between the provided properties or the characteristics of a service on 
the one hand and the requested customer requirements one the other hand. 
Due to the fact that services are in general immaterial and the complex relationship 
between customer and service provider, it is often not possible to measure the service 
quality directly. The GAP model represents a comprehensive framework for deter-
mining the quality of services from the customer and company perspective [15][19]. 
Basis of the GAP model is a division of the interaction relationship into the levels 
service provider and customer. The GAP model gives an important approach for the 
detection of faults and gaps in the information flow. The Gaps of this model describe 
the reasons of quality defects – or rather risks – within the service production [20]. 
2.2 
Service Risks 
The term ‘risk’ is used in a wide range of meanings [21-26]. This applies either for 
the scientific debate as well as for general linguistic usage. In everyday speech the 
term is normally used, when negative and unpredictability effects accompany particu-
lar events, therefore it is often used in the context of ventures and dangers [27][28]. 
The term ‘risk’ therefore is defined as “an uncertain event which, should it occur, 
would have an effect on achieving the objectives” [26].  
The following definition of risk, which is also applied within the scope of the pre-
sented approach, reflects these characteristics: 
“Risk arises from the uncertainty of future events – whereupon this regularly 
comes along with an incomplete level of information – and is reflected in the action 
related effect of a negative discrepancy from a fixed aim.” [29] 
Risks can be classified in several ways. The types of risk and especially the relative 
importance for a company very much depends on the specifics of the company, espe-
cially as branch-specifics, regional characteristics, etc. [30]. The transitions between 
the different types of risk are of course fluent. While Campenhausen just differs quite 
widely between strategic, operational and financial risks, Kalweit makes an additional 
distinction at the strategic and operational risks between external and internal risks. 
Within the presented approach the occurring risks can be divided into service spe-
cific risks and service unspecific risks. The service unspecific risks come along with 

362 
R. Schmitt, S. Schumacher, and T. Zentis 
 
every kind of product or service, like latent and also financial risks, for example a 
change of laws or the general economic situation. These risks have to be identified 
and controlled, but cannot be influenced by the service provider. 
In contrast the companies can use their experience and different management me-
thods to avoid service specific risks. Yet an established risk management system, 
adapted to the characteristics of service innovations is not existent. Therefore, the 
focus of the presented approach lies on the examination of the service specific risks. 
Services are defined by their constitutive characteristics, as the immateriality, the 
simultaneity of accruement and consumption, the high individuality, the process cha-
racter and above all the high level of customer integration [19][32]. Compared to 
physical products those service characteristics induce additional risks. The high indi-
viduality of services in combination with the strong interaction between service pro-
ducer and customer makes the implementation of a standardized process almost  
impossible. Furthermore, prior function controls or rectifications are not realizable 
because of the immateriality and the simultaneity of accruement and consumption of 
services; these constitutive characteristics demand for a “first time right” service pro-
vision. These circumstances create a multitude of service specific risks, which have to 
be identified, analyzed, assessed and controlled.

Risk-Management-Approach for Service-Innovations 
In order to support companies with the systematic generation and implementation of 
service innovations, a holistic model (figure 1) is developed in the scope of the

research project ‘ServRisk’, which integrates risk management into the service inno-
vation process to ensure a preventive service quality management. It starts with the 
generation of innovations, followed by the identification and assessment of risks and 
ends up with the implementation and evaluation of the performance of the new 
created service. The approach consists of these three phases, which are divided into 
ten steps. 
3.1 
Service-Ideation 
The idea for a service innovation arises through the interaction with customers, the 
study of market and competition conditions, through new technologies or within the 
company. The implementation of an innovation can occur in connection with new 
developments of services or through modifying existing processes, organizational 
structures, forms of contracts and sales channels, changed accompanying products as 
well as in opening up new markets. Especially the interaction with customers is an 
important factor for new developments as this provides a maximum information den-
sity for innovations and further developments. Furthermore, it supports a substantial 
reduction of development time [33]. Besides that, it is statistically proven, that an 
increased autonomy of staff with direct customer contact enhances the innovativeness 
of service companies [34]. 
3.2 
Idea-Quick-Check 
The second step is called "Idea-Quick-Check". By answering seven special questions 
it serves to check whether an idea for a new service generally has the potential to 
become a service innovation. A first selection of ideas can be made by using the fol-
lowing questions: 
1. Does the innovation contribute to strengthen the customer loyalty? 
2. Is the innovation suitable to generate its own income? 
3. Allows the innovation for gathering information about the customer? 
4. Does the innovation influence the image of the company positively? 
5. Does the innovation contribute to offset fluctuations in capacity? 
6. Allows the innovation for creating more comfort and security for customer-facing 
employees and their workplace? 
7. Does the innovation lead to a competitive advantage with regard to other compa-
nies? 
For passing the filtering at least one of these questions has to be answered in the af-
firmative. If this applies to a considered innovation idea, it should be pursued and the 
further steps should be continued. In case no question could be answered in the affir-
mative, there seems no benefit to be given for the company and the service idea can 
already be discarded at this early stage. 
3.3 
Service-Concept 
In step three a rough concept is designed for the innovative service ideas, which have 
successfully passed the previous “Idea-Quick-Check”. That basic concept includes 

364 
R. Schmitt, S. Schumacher, and T. Zentis 
 
first calculations of the required resources, personnel capacity and personnel qualifi-
cation. Furthermore, it encompasses a basic process design with internal and external 
interfaces and an appraisal of the expected sales figures. 
Consequently, all relevant information that is necessary for a successful identifica-
tion and evaluation of innovation risks is collected in this step. Thus, it should be 
handled with great care, because it represents the basis for the following steps. 
3.4 
Risk-Identification 
Within the approach, the service specific risks are divided once more, into strategic 
risks and risks which come into existence during the service development and deli-
very process. 
The strategic risks include factors such as deficient personnel calculation, inade-
quate trainings for the personnel, too many hierarchy levels, etc. They are not related 
to the service delivery process but are, anyhow, affected by the service character of 
the innovation. The company’s location for example could be of greater strategic 
relevance for a service company, as the physical proximity to the customer is a more 
significant factor in the field of service delivery than for manufacturing enterprises. 
Checklists as well as different creative techniques for instance brainstorming and 
brain-writing can be used for identifying and collecting strategic risks [27]. 
The service quality and by that also the success of a service innovation depends on 
the perceived service quality of the customer respectively on the fulfillment of the 
customer requirements [15]. Therefore, the main risk in fact is that the new imple-
mented service does not comply with the customers’ wishes and expectations, which 
causes a rejection of the service innovation by the customers. Services show a certain 
process character and in addition to that, the accruement and consumption of services 
occur simultaneously. Due to that fact, the whole process, including service develop-
ment and service delivery need to be characterized by high quality, as the customer is 
involved in every step of the process and by that also perceives the quality of every 
single phase. 
In summary, the process of service development and providing includes the identi-
fication of the customers’ wishes and expectations, the transmission of those into high 
quality services and finally the service delivery. In this context a positive customer 
perception is the main factor of success for a service innovation. Since this perception 
considers the entire service process, a demand for a concept can be derived, which 
enables the companies to identify service risks along the entire service process and at 
the same time considers the special role of the customer. These requirements are 
achieved by the GAP-Model. 
The GAP-Model is a conceptual framework, which supports the determination of 
service quality from both, the perspective of the customer and that of the company 
[19][15]. The GAP-Model offers an important approach for the identification of inter-
ruptions and gaps during the flow of information and as well for potential risks. The 
gaps describe the sources of quality defects along the service process. “A set of key 
discrepancies or gaps exist regarding executive perceptions of service quality and the 
task associated with service delivery to the consumer. These gaps can be major hur-
dles in attempting to deliver a service which consumers would perceive as being of 
high quality.“  [35]

3.5 
Risk-Analysis 
Once a risk has been identified, the probability of occurrence as well as the extent of loss 
have to be assigned to this risk. This requires a detailed knowledge regarding to the caus-
es and consequences of the corresponding risk. Many authors demand a FMEA (failure 
mode and effects analysis) execution to observe and analyze risks of a new service 
[18][36]. In the majority of cases such an analysis is, however, quite elaborate [37]. 
Due to the fact that the presented approach is geared towards small- and medium-
sized enterprises (SME) a fishbone- or rather Ishikawa-diagram is envisaged to ana-
lyze the risk causes (left-hand side of figure 2). The risk is entered at the ‘head’ of the 
fishbone-diagram whereas the main dimensions, which influence the risk origination, 
will be listed along the ‘bones’. This conduces to structure the individual risks as well 
as the root cause analysis [38]. Thus, it is possible to deduce starting points for reduc-
ing or even avoiding a risk. 
 
Fig. 2. Scheme of Risk-Analysis 
After the causes for risks are identified, the associated consequences have to be es-
timated in a following step as shown on the right-hand side of figure 2. It is may be 
appropriate to combine the risk consequences – similar to the causes in the fishbone-
diagram – in categories or to form concatenations of risks consequences and display 
them graphically. Points of reference for the identification of risk consequences can 
be for instance economic (loss of sales, penalties, fines, surcharges) as well as soft, 
customer-orientated facts (image, customer relationship etc.). The ensured discussion 
of the possible risk consequences within the scope of the optional risk analysis allows 
a precise and realistic risk assessment in the following phase. 
3.6 
Risk-Assessment 
The assessment of the individual service risks is also made in accordance with com-
mon risk assessments with regard to a probability of occurrence and a extent of loss. 
In the presented approach it turned out to be practicable if each the probability and the

extent are differentiated into five classes. In addition, another parameter has been 
implemented, the so called assessability. It is hereby the goal to depict the knowledge 
of the company regarding to certain risks on a scale from one to five. This parameter 
is regarded in the risk assessment and shall ensure that the relation between the risk 
extent and the knowledge or rather the analysis expense is appropriated and in accor-
dance with the risk strategy. 
After that the assigned values for the probability of occurrence and the extent of 
loss of each individual risk are multiplied. Thus, the highest possible level is twenty-
five, whereby the lowest possible is one. Specific actions, which are used to handle 
with individual risks, should depend on the descending order of the prioritized risk 
values. In this context different opportunities exist to avoid, to reduce, to spread or 
finally to bear risks. 
 
Fig. 3. Risk-Matrix of Risk-Assessment 
According to their probability of occurrence and extent of loss the identified risks 
receive a position within the risk matrix. To clarify the need for action the different 
areas of the risk matrix are highlighted in different colors. Thereby, red stands for a 
high, yellow for a medium and green for a minor risk. If the state of knowledge for a 
risk is very limited or the own knowledge seems to be insufficient compared with the 
probability of occurrence and the extent of loss this risk is signed with a warning 
symbol in the matrix. This indicates the need for action with regard to further investi-
gation, which can require a return to the previous, optional step of risk analysis. Fig-
ure 3 shows an example for a risk matrix with seven risks. Due to the fact, that the 
state of knowledge is insufficient for the risks one and four, they are marked with a 
warning symbol. 
3.7 
Decision of Realization 
The last step of the second phase directs to a reasoned decision whether the innova-
tion should be implemented or discarded. The decision is based on the assessment of 
risks and possible opportunities.

Quality-Oriented Risk-Management-Approach for Service Innovations 
367 
 
Innovations, which have a high potential considering their possible opportunities 
and are fraught with calculable risks should be pursued and implemented. 
3.8 
Service-Engineering and Implementation 
The phase of Service-Engineering includes the development of concepts, elements 
and processes of service innovations. Followed by the implementation, in which the 
worked out concepts are realized. This includes for example the creation of docu-
ments, the procurement of necessary technical equipment as well as the training of 
employees.  
In the phase of the detailed design and implementation of a service innovation all 
risks, which have been identified and characterized in advance have to be addressed. 
This especially contains the design of options for appropriate actions on how to deal 
with the risks. For the purpose of controlling or manage the risks different goals or 
rather measures can be followed. The most important include hereby the complete 
avoidance, the reduction of consequences of an occurrence, the transmission and the 
separation as well as the retention and setting up of a plan for the recovery of the orig-
inal state.  
The most important elements of a risk management are the risk register as well as 
the risk management plan. The register comprises primarily documents about the 
status of the individual risks and should be kept up-to-date. In addition to this it can 
be used as a basis for regular review dates as well as for the setting up and change of 
the risk management plan, which designates methods, processes and interfaces of the 
risk management. Furthermore it regulates responsibilities, authorities as well as roles 
or rather responsibilities of employees. 
3.9 
Service-Delivery and Risk-Monitoring 
The last step of the presented approach comprises the monitoring of risks and the 
continuous improvement of services in the delivery. As with all product innovations 
undesirable conditions and occurred faults have to be expected, which cannot be fore-
seen in the design and planning phase. This implies that the level of quality and the 
continuous improvement of the service have to be sustainably ensured by the use of 
corresponding methods. In this regard the implementation of control loops, an effi-
cient complaint management as well as a regular observation of the risk register and 
the risk management plan are typical methods. According to a sustainable risk man-
agement these particular documents by no means represent fixed recordings of the 
engineering phase. In fact, they should be seen as working documents for a regular 
performed review of the service innovation during normal operation. 
Based on the detailed evaluation of the delivered services, ideas for new service 
innovations can be generated by the customer contact personnel. As a result, the cycle 
of the approach starts again.

Conclusion 
Innovations serve as an opportunity for companies to differentiate themselves from 
their competitors, but they are also fraught with risks. The systematically developed 

368 
R. Schmitt, S. Schumacher, and T. Zentis 
 
approach for identifying, analyzing and assessing these risks was validated with three 
project partners. It supports the companies considerably within the quality-oriented 
service development. It enables the identification of risks and the subsequent analysis 
and evaluation of innovation ideas in the service sector, in order to make a well-
funded decision for or against an innovation idea. This will counteract the present 
trend in practice, in which many decisions are made ad hoc and thus not only finan-
cial losses have to be suffered, but also customer loyalty may be damaged.

Abstract. Product-Service System (PSS) is regarded as a new business concept 
for manufacturing firms to enhance the value of their products and build up 
strong relationships with their customers. To realize a sustainable business, it is 
important for them to make a business situation where each stakeholder in-
volved receives values through the provision of PSS. The designers have to 
have a holistic view and consider the total value created within the system. This 
paper proposes a method to design PSS that have high value for each stakehold-
er. In this method, a PSS is designed through a “design cycle” composed of 
three phases such as: (1) modeling, (2) simulation, and (3) new scenario de-
scription. In this method, a PSS is designed under the simultaneous considera-
tion of values received by various stakeholders.

Introduction 
Product-Service System (PSS) is nowadays regarded as a new business model for 
manufacturing firms to gain competitiveness. PSS is a consisting of tangible products 
and intangible services designed and combined so that they jointly are capable of 
fulfilling specific customer needs [1]. To achieve a sustainable business through PSS 
offering, it is important to realize a business situation where each stakeholder in-
volved in the PSS can receive sufficient amount of values. Namely, PSS designers 
have to have a holistic view and consider the “total” value created for all stakeholders 
in the PSS.

PSS Design 
2.1 
Definition of PSS 
The concept of PSS is sometimes regarded as just a combined provision of product 
and service that fulfills customer needs (e.g., machine and maintenance). However, 
such vision for PSS can be thought as an insufficient understanding of the concept. 
The essence of the concept is that realizing a social system where all stakeholders 
including providers and receivers can receive sufficient values through cross-offerings 

372

of products and services. This “system”, which consists of various stakeholders who 
provide/receive products and services, exactly corresponds to the last “S” in a term 
“PSS”. Meier et al. [2] explains this concept in a context of Industrial PSS as Figure 
1. This figure illustrates a PSS is not just a “product plus service” but a system of co- 
and cross-offering of a product/ service/ product-service combination. 
On the basis of the discussion above, in this research, a service is defined as “a so-
cial system to enhance social and economic values for stakeholders through the co- 
and cross- offering of products/ services/ product-services within the system.” Here, 
product-service means the integrated offering of product and service.

2.2 
PSS Design 
Researches to establish a methodology to design PSS have been widely conducted in 
these years. The authors have proposed methods for designing PSS within the series 
of Japanese Service Engineering (SE) research [3-4]. In our approach, customer val-
ues are represented as parameters; the basic structure of a PSS is modeled with the 
functional structure that satisfies customer needs, and specific entities are associated 
with the functional structure. Here, entities include both physical products and human 
resources.  
Meanwhile, Müller et al. proposes the PSS Layer Method [5] for designing PSS. In 
Layer Method, a PSS is modeled with eight basic elements: Needs, Values, Delive-
rables, Activities, Actors, Core product, Periphery, and Contract. Needs and Values 
are firstly defined. Other six elements are then determined on the basis of the defined 
needs and values. 
2.3 
Total Value within a PS “System” 
As discussed in 2.1, in PSS design, it is important to design PSS structure that creates 
high values for each stakeholder. A famous PSS example “Power-by-the-hour” by 
Rolls-Royce plc. [6] is a good design solution from such viewpoint. Here, Rolls-
Royce leases out the power of a gas turbine engine rather than transferring ownership 
of the engine product. Many services such as fixed-fee maintenance, back-up service, 
condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and parts-life management are offered 
to customers. By doing this, risks in the usage of turbine engine can be decreased, and 
at the same time, the engine provider can collect data on product use that is useful for 
Independent Service 
and Product

new product development. The Power-by-the-hour solution can provides values for 
both provider and receiver and realize the “win-win” relationship between them. In 
addition, this solution has positive value for the global environment, which can be 
regarded as a stakeholder, since the reusability of engine parts can be increased 
through the consistent product management by engine provider. 
However, it is difficult to design such PSS structure using the existing PSS design 
methods reported in 2.2, since they do not explicitly focus on values for all stakehold-
ers involved. The design target of these methods is increasing values of specific cus-
tomer, who is just one component of its stakeholder network.  
This paper proposes a method to design PSS that have high value for each stake-
holder. In this method, a PSS is designed through a “design cycle” composed of three 
phases such as: (1) modeling, (2) simulation, and (3) new scenario description. In this 
method, a PSS is designed under the simultaneous consideration of values received by 
various stakeholders.

System Modeling and Simulation 
3.1 
System Dynamics 
System Dynamics (SD) [7] is an approach to understanding and analyzing the be-
havior of complex system over time through the modeling of relationships among 
components within the system. SD can deal with internal feedback loops and time 
delays that affect the behavior of the entire system.  
In the SD methodology, a system is first represented as the Causal Loop Diagram 
(CLD). A CLD is a map of the system with all its constituent components and their 
interactions. By capturing interactions and the feedback loops, a causal loop diagram 
reveals the structure of a system.  
The CLD supports to visualize a system’s structure and behavior and to analyze the 
system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis, a CLD is 
transformed to a Stock and Flow Diagram (SFD). In SFD, the structure of a system is 
modeled with the concepts of “stocks” and “flows”. A stock is a component that ac-
cumulates or depletes over time. On the other hand, a flow is the rate of change in a 
stock. Figure 2 illustrates examples of CLD and SFD that represents a social system 
focusing on the population change. In the CLD (Figure 2 (a)), two kinds of feedback 
loops are illustrated. A feedback loop colored blue is a positive reinforcement loop 
that represents the number of “population” will be increased when the more number 
of “births” is obtained. The other loop colored red is a negative reinforcement loop. 
This loop represents a negative effect of “deaths” on the number of “population”. 
Figure 2 (b) is the SFD that is translated from the CLD shown in Figure 2 (a). This 
diagram depicts that a stock variable “population” changes due to two flow variables 
“births” and “deaths”; and the number of births and deaths are determined by other 
subsidiary variables such as “the rate of birth” and “the rate of death”. The behavior 
of this system is simulated by producing mathematical descriptions among those  
variables.

PSS Modeling and Simulation with System Dynamics  
Generally, the SD is suitable for modeling and simulating a social system that in-
cludes multiple and complex feedback loops. A PSS can be regarded as a social  
system including many feedback loops, since multiple stakeholders exist within the 
system and they mutually affect each other. In this research, consequently, the SD is 
utilized to model a PSS structure and to simulate its behavior. The simulation enables 
designers to evaluate values received by stakeholders in the phase of design.

PSS Design Considering Total Value for Various 
Stakeholders 
4.1 
Design Cycle 
Figure 3 shows the overview of the proposed method. The method enables to design a 
PSS that has high total values for all stakeholders involved with an approach of a 
“design cycle” composed of three phases such as: “modeling”, “simulation”, and 
“new scenario description”.  
 
Fig. 3. Overview of the proposed method 
The first cycle of this design cycle (colored red in Figure 3) is that for analyzing 
the current structure of a PSS. In this cycle, the design goals are defined through the 
modeling and simulation of the current PSS. Subsequently, a design solution can be

derived by repeating the design cycle for creating new PSS structure (colored blue in 
Figure 3). The remainder of the Section 4 (4.2 – 4.4) explains concrete methods and 
procedures of each phase of this cycle, namely “modeling”, “simulation”, and “new 
scenario description”.  
4.2 
PSS Modeling 
On the basis of the definition discussed in 2.1, in this research, we model a PSS struc-
ture with four elements: “stakeholder”, “value”, “PS provided/received within the 
system”, and “Material, money, and Information provided/received within the sys-
tem”. The model is called as PSS network model. Figure 4 shows an example. In this 
figure, the stakeholder A provides a PS for stakeholder B, and receives information at 
the same time. Meanwhile, the stakeholder C receives money in exchange for a prod-
uct, which is represented as material flow in Figure 4. It is noteworthy that a term 
“value” in this model includes both economic value (e.g., profit, cost, etc.) and social 
value (e.g, health, usability, etc.). 
 
Fig. 4. PSS network model 
4.3 
PSS Simulation 
A CLD is constructed based on the constructed PSS network model. Here, parameters 
that measure the fulfillment of each stakeholder’s values are determined. Then, va-
riables that have direct/indirect influences for the change of the parameters are col-
lected by, for example, the brainstorming method. These variables and parameters are 
connected each other with causal relationship, and CLD is constructed. The SFD is 
then obtained by translating the CLD for the quantitative simulation. 
By setting mathematical equations to each relation between variables in SFD, a 
quantitative simulation to observe temporal changes of the each stakeholder’s values 
can be carried out. 
4.4 
New Scenario Description 
On the basis of the simulation result, designers co-create hypothetical scenarios  
regarding new PSS structures in which each stakeholder can obtain higher value.

Designers then model the created scenario with the PSS network model and evaluate 
it with the SD simulation. If the simulation result satisfies the design goal defined 
sufficiently, it can be adopted as a design solution. If not, designers have to re-
consider new scenario for the PSS.

Application to an Example Case 
5.1 
Example Case: A Car Sharing Example 
The proposed method was applied to an example PSS case to verify the effectiveness 
of the method. The example used in this study was a car sharing operated in a specific 
area of Tokyo city center. Descriptions below explain the detailed settings of the ex-
ample.  
• The car sharing service is already commonly used in the area.  
• Generally, if car sharing services become widely used in a specific area where ca 
sharing is not so common, the car ownership rate will decline and the total number 
of cars in the area will come down. However, in this example, we assumed that the 
car sharing is commonly used and the car ownership rate is already low. Therefore, 
even in a case that a car sharing service become more popular, the total number of 
cars in the area will not be decrease but increase due to the increased number of car 
sharing stations. 
• The customers’ purpose of using a car is to go to a big shopping mall, which is 
located approximately 15 kilo meters from Tokyo city center, in weekend. It is 
noteworthy that each customer goes to the shopping mall once a month, and in the 
other weekend, they do shopping at the city center without using cars. 
• Gasoline cost is included in the fees for car sharing service. Namely the car sharing 
provider pays for the gasoline to gas stations. 
• Too many number of car sharing users results in a decrease of availability of a car 
sharing service, since the number of cars is limited in the area. In this context, 
availability means the rate that users can use a car when he wants to use it. 
• The increased number of cars on roads leads to the higher probability of traffic 
jam, which makes users frustrated. 
• The car sharing provider can collect data of product use (e.g., user attributes, travel 
distance, destination, etc.) 
• Car manufacturing and use emit CO2 into the global environment. 
5.2 
Modeling of the Current Structure of Car Sharing Example 
At first, the current structure of the car sharing was modeled with the PSS network 
model. Figure 5 illustrates the result. As shown in Figure 5, stakeholders of the car 
sharing were user, car sharing provider, car manufacturer, gas station, shopping mall 
in Tokyo suburb, shops in Tokyo city center, and the global environment. Here, each

stakeholder has his own values. For example, the users require values such as “low 
cost”, “high availability”, and “low rate of traffic jam”. 
 
Fig. 5. The result of PSS modeling by the PSS network model 
5.3 
Simulation of Car sharing Example  
From the constructed PSS network model, parameters that measure the fulfillment of 
each stakeholder’s values were determined. For instance, “cost that a user pays for the 
use of a car” was set as a parameter to measure the fulfillment of a user’s value “low 
cost”. Subsequently, variables that have direct/indirect influences for the change of 
the parameters were collected through the brainstorming process. These variables and 
parameters were connected each other with causal relationship; and CLD was then 
constructed. The result is shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6, parameters that measure the 
fulfillment of each stakeholder’s values are colored green; arrows colored blue 
represents the positive causal relationships and that of colored red are the negative 
relationships.  
In this CLD model, some feedback loops that determine the system behavior can 
be found. Figure 7 depicts examples of feedback loops as determinants of “Profit of 
the car sharing provider.” Here, three kinds of feedback loops are found. Two of them 
are positive loops (loops colored blue with “+”) that correspond mechanisms to en-
hance car sharing provider’s profit; and the other is a negative loop (a loop colored 
red with “-”) that decrease his profit. The “Profit of the car sharing provider” is calcu-
lated by the power balance of these positive and negative loops.

on the basis of the statistical surveys by the Tokyo metropolitan government [9] and 
other reports concerning the car sharing business in Japan [10-12]. 
• The number of households in the target area: 44,000 (Car ownership rate: 50%) 
• The number of users who use the car sharing service in a weekend: 308 (0.7% of 
the all households) 
• The initial number of car sharing stations: 150  
• The number of cars in one station: 2 
• Fees for car sharing: 100 JPY/km 
• Fuel-efficiency of a car: 12.8 km/L 
• Amount of CO2 emission in driving a car: 35 g/km 
• The rate of traffic jams on the road in the target area: 20% up to 120 cars used. If 
more than 120 cars are used, the probability becomes 50% and it will increase li-
nearly depending on the number of cars. 
The results of the simulation were shown in Figure 7. These graphs represent the tem-
poral changes of the each stakeholder’s values. On the basis of the results, goals of 
this PSS design were defined as below. 
1. Make the value of availability 1.0 at any time. (All users can use a car at any time 
when they want to use it.) 
2. Reduce the CO2 emissions.  
3. Decline the probability of traffic jams.

New Scenario Description and Evaluation 
In this application, two scenarios, which are described in Table 1, were created to 
improve the car sharing PSS. The first one was “Electric Vehicle (EV)” scenario and 
the other was “Cooperation with public transportation” scenario. These scenarios 
were then translated into the PSS network models, CLD, and finally SFD. Simulations 
to evaluate the amount of values that each stakeholder receives were carried out. Fig-
ure 8 illustrates the simulation results. In Figure 8, graphs regarding “Revenue of the 
utility company,” “Amount of power consumption,” and “Revenues of the rail com-
pany” are newly appeared, since new stakeholders such as the utility company and 
rail company were added in the two scenarios created. 
Figure 8 shows that the “EV” scenario is very effective to reduce CO2 emissions 
and oil consumptions. It also contributes to the increase in profits of the car manufac-
turer. However, it does not have positive effects to improve availability and to decline 
the probability of traffic jams. It can be therefore said that this scenario does not satis-
fy the design goals sufficiently. On the other hand, in the “Cooperation with public 
transportation” scenario, the value of availability was always 1.0 and the probability 
of traffic jams were declined by 5% compared to the current PSS. It also contributes 
to reduce CO2 emissions and oil consumptions. Moreover, a public rail company was 
added as a new stakeholder, and his profits can be increased.  
From these results, the “Cooperation with public transportation” scenario was ac-
cepted as a (tentative) design solution, since it could be thought that the scenario satis-
fied design goals. However, there is a room to improve the solution, since the profit of 
the car sharing provider would be decreased in this scenario as shown in Figure 8.

Overview: All of cars used in car sharing are changed to EVs. In this 
scenario, it is expected to reduce CO2 emissions and oil consumptions. 
Stakeholders and values newly added: A utility company whose value 
is “high profit” was added as a new stakeholder. “Less electronic pow-
er consumption” was newly added as a value for global environment. 
Coopera-
tion with

tation 
Overview: The car sharing provider establishes partnership with a rail 
company offering public transportation. New car sharing stations are 
newly constructed near a station at Tokyo suburb. Some of users take a 
train to the station and use a car to the shopping mall. In this scenario, 
it is expected to decline the probability of traffic jams at city center 
area as well as reducing CO2 emissions and oil consumptions. 
Stakeholders and values newly added: A rail company whose value is 
“high profit” was added as a new stakeholder.

Concluding Remarks 
In this research, a method to design PSS that have high value for each stakeholder is 
proposed. The idea of this study is to realize the simultaneous consideration of values 
received by various stakeholders with the “design cycle” approach. The design cycle 
proposed in this study is composed of three phases such as: (1) modeling, (2) simula-
tion, and (3) new scenario description.  
The proposed method was applied to an example PSS case featuring car sharing. In 
the application, it was possible to design new car sharing service such as “Coopera-
tion with public transportation” under consideration of values received by each stake-
holder involved. Designers could create new PSS scenario on the basis of the results 
of the modeling and simulation. The models (i.e., PSS network model, CLD, SFD) 
provided a kind of unified view for co-designing among multiple designers. The si-
mulation enables designers to evaluate the designed PSS structure and the results 
were effectively used as criteria when they consider new PSS scenarios. 
On the other hand, the translation between models, especially translation from the 
PSS network model to CLD, put a burden on designers. It really depended on

Abstract. Although the early stages of engineering service development are es-
sential, methods and tools to proactively and comprehensively evaluate the 
productivity of service processes are rare. Therefore, this paper presents a com-
prehensive model for product-service systems productivity assessment along 
the service provision chain. The novel productivity model distinguishes be-
tween potential, process and outcome thus covers all dimensions of a product-
service system. The model further differentiates between service provider and 
customer from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view. A set of value 
drivers and success criteria is proposed in a structured manner, resulting in var-
ious levers to optimize a product-service system. The model is made fully oper-
ational by defining influence factors, representing parameters to optimize  
service productivity and by key figures measuring service effectiveness and ef-
ficiency. To evaluate the novel service productivity model, field data and expert 
opinions from two German engineering companies are considered.

sessment, Service Productivity.

Introduction and Motivation 
Besides offering pure component development services, providers of complex engi-
neering services are eager to offer complementary design and optimization services 
across the entire product lifecycle. Thereby, the early phases of product-service sys-
tems design play a crucial role and provide the foundation for high product quality as 
well as for successful and sustainable service provision [1], [21-22]. 
Continuous productivity improvement in manufacturing belongs to the standard 
repertoire of business managers. As services gained significant importance in devel-
oping and developed countries, existing traditional models, methods and tools for 
productivity management were not sufficiently adopted to cope with emerging

product-service system-specific characteristics. A holistic approach for performance 
assessment is needed to comprehensively design and manage product-service  
systems. 
This paper aims to bridge the gap and provides a comprehensive service system 
productivity model. In the next section, a brief overview of relevant service defini-
tions is given and productivity definitions from manufacturing are discussed. The 
relevant service productivity models are described and important characteristics of 
services to be considered in a service productivity model are pointed out. Based on 
these findings our novel service productivity model is presented and evaluated by 
field data from semi-structured interviews and workshops with service experts.

Services and Productivity 
2.1 
Services 
In literature, the most common starting point for defining services is the macroeco-
nomic division of industry sectors and branches. The World Trade Organization pro-
vides a sectoral classification list consisting of 12 sectors and 160 sub-sectors aiming 
a cross-country comparability and consistency of service policies defined in the 
“General Agreement on Trade in Services” [10]. Such an approach is not suitable for 
service evaluation and design due to the classification on a broad level and a fuzzy 
differentiation of the branches. There are no general accepted criteria for the delimita-
tion and thus the classification remains ambiguous [3]. 
From the business economics perspective, different approaches for service defini-
tion can be distinguished. Simple approaches aim at defining services by examples; 
more advanced approaches distinguish services from goods by describing main dif-
ferences. These approaches face the problem that a generally accepted list of differ-
ences does not exist [3], [16]. 
The most common approach on a definition of services is based on the specification 
of constitutive service characteristics according to Hilke (1989) and Donabedian 
(1980). Following their dimensional differentiation, services can be defined along the 
service provision chain in three dimensions: the potential dimension, the process di-
mension and the outcome dimension. Many scholars have adopted and enhanced this 
concept by enlarging it with relevant service specific characteristics known as the 
IHIP characteristics: Intangibility, Heterogeneity, Inseparability and Perishability [8]. 
Services are perishable because, unlike goods, they cannot be stored and are highly 
space and time dependent. The service provision and consumption process are inse-
parably connected because of the customer integration. As the customer is an integra-
tive part of the service provision and the service itself is intangible, complex services 
are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity and the perceived service outcome 
is from immaterial nature.

2.2 
Productivity 
A macroeconomic definition of productivity is given by the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development [17]. Following OECD, productivity is defined 
as the ratio of value based outputs to inputs for tracing technical change, identifying 
changes in efficiency as well as benchmarking production processes. Productivity 
measures are classified either as single factor productivity measures or multifactor 
productivity measures relating to one or multiple factors of input. OECD further diffe-
rentiates input factors between single measures like labor and capital or multifactor 
measures like capital-labor. In terms of output measures, a differentiation between 
gross output and value added concepts is proposed.  
Productivity measurement from the macroeconomic point of view has some advan-
tages for comparing countries and industry branches. The main drawback refers to the 
black box perspective taken in terms of neglecting the joint influence of a subset of 
factors. Thus, multifactor productivity measure seems more suitable for a differen-
tiated factor analysis. The drawback of this approach is the diversity of the input as 
well as output factors. Indexing the price is one possible solution to cope with this 
problem, but price indices are difficult to measure in the service industry [17]. Fur-
thermore, the measures proposed are only suitable on a broad level; without further 
research the identification of interrelations of levers for productivity improvements on 
a business process level is not possible.  
Productivity in business economics is defined similarly as the ratio of volumes of 
output and input, but it is related to isolated production systems, mainly production 
plants and sites. Corsten (1994, 2007) specifies productivity from a broad, economic 
point of view and a narrowed, technical point of view. From a broad perspective 
productivity is considered as the profitability of the company and it is defined as the 
ratio between income and input factor costs. Technically, productivity is defined as 
the ratio between volumes of input and output describing the production capability of 
the system. 
The major deficit of business economics oriented productivity concepts is the con-
sideration of isolated production systems, where the customer is not an active part of 
the process. Thus, service specific characteristics like customer influence and custom-
er perceived quality are not considered in these concepts. 
2.3 
Characteristics of Specific Service Productivity Concepts 
There is a general mismatch between the specific service characteristics like IHIP and 
the technical, production oriented productivity concept. According to the description 
of services in section 2.1, some scholars developed specific concepts of service prod-
uctivity. These service productivity models refer to many aspects of the named consti-
tutive characteristics of services and therefore show some similarities. However, they 
also differ in certain significant aspects, and so far no generally accepted service 
productivity model exists.

Provider and Customer Differentiation. An important aspect, which is inherent 
when considering services, is the integration of the customer in the service provision 
chain. Here, especially the fundamental findings of Parasuraman et al. (1985) should 
be mentioned. They identified a significant gap between perceived, delivered service 
quality by the service provider, and the expected service quality by the customer. 
These findings had a great impact not only on service quality research but influenced 
many productivity concepts by considering service quality as well as customer’s in-
fluence. In his later work Parasuraman (2002) proposes a conceptual framework de-
scribing the impact of service quality on provider’s and a customer’s productivity as 
well as some causal relationships between inputs and outputs.  
A similar approach was developed by Johnston and Jones (2004) who define op-
erational and customer productivity and give some counterintuitive examples on fac-
tors influencing both under consideration of their relationships. They also suggest that 
further research on the relationship between elements of service provider and custom-
er productivity is needed. Finally, Grönroos and Ojasalo (2004) differentiate between 
three service process stages. In the first stage the service provider produces the ser-
vice in isolation from the customer. In the second, customer and service provider are 
interacting for service provision, and in the third stage, the self-service stage the cus-
tomer produces the service in isolation from the service provider. Furthermore, some 
examples of input and output factors along with their relationship to the proposed 
stages are mentioned. 
Because of the great influence of the costumer in all dimensions of service provi-
sion, it is prerequisite to consider both service provider and service customer in a 
comprehensive service productivity assessment. 
 
Three Dimensional Approaches. A dimensional differentiation in potential, process 
and outcome dimension can also be found in the majority of service productivity 
models. Donabedian (1980) uses this three-dimensional differentiation to assess quali-
ty of medical care. Likewise, Jones (1988) describes service operations based on a 
three stage model where inputs are transformed into outcomes through outputs. He 
also defines stage specific management approaches for productivity enhancement 
induced by the proposed differentiation. A two stage based productivity formula is 
proposed by Corsten (1994), who defines the productivity of the so called “pre-
combination” as the ratio of the willingness to perform to the provider’s input factors. 
In the process dimension, where the “end-combination” takes place, the productivity 
is defined as the ratio of actual output to the sum of willingness to perform and a 
combination of internal and external factors. 
Since Donabedian (1980), Jones (1988), and Corsten (1994) almost every scholar 
refers to this dimensional differentiation to structure productivity assessment. As a 
conclusion, the tri-dimensional differentiation is a suitable approach for a service 
productivity assessment model.

Quantitative and Qualitative Aspects of Service Provision. Another aspect of ser-
vice provision worth to consider is the importance of not only quantitative but also 
qualitative aspects of service provision. One of the main differences between tradi-
tional production systems and product-service systems is the explicit consideration of 
quality in every single stage of service provision. The high impact of quality on ser-
vice productivity is pointed out by Jones (1988), Parasuraman (2002) as well as 
Gummeson (1998). Parasuraman et al. (1985) not only identify five gaps of service 
quality but furthermore propose a list of determinants of service quality. Besides ob-
jectively quantifiable factors like tangibles (facilities, tools, etc.) also subjective, qua-
litative factors like courtesy of the employees, credibility, etc. exists. Quality as well 
as qualitative factors are considered in the service productivity models developed by 
Vuorinen et al. (1998) and Grönroos and Ojasalo (2004). They define service provi-
sion output similar to Parasuraman et al. (1985) as customer perceived quality and 
stress the importance of qualitative input factors like employees’ motivation or  
behavior.  
Concluding, it is prerequisite to consider objectively quantitative factors as well as 
subjectively qualitative factors in service productivity assessment. 
 
Productivity Assessment in Terms of Effectiveness and Efficiency. Finally, the 
main objective of a service productivity model is to assess managerial and product-
service system performance and to support service manager’s and planer’s decision 
making. Among others a manager has to optimize the job being done [7]. A know-
ledge-worker has to “do the things right” and has to “do the right things” namely to 
ensure an efficient and effective execution of the job [7]. According to Freeborn and 
Greenlick (1973) the evaluation of system performance only by considering the three 
dimensions as pointed out by Donabedian (1966) falls short, it should in addition be 
further assessed according to the success criteria of efficiency and effectiveness. He-
reby, efficiency is defined as the degree of generating a given amount of output with a 
mi-nimum of inputs or generating a largest possible output from a given quantity of 
inputs. Effectiveness indicates the degree of the achievement of the service objectives 
[22]. Effectiveness is often defined as achieving quality for the customer [12]. As a 
conclusion, a comprehensive performance evaluation has to consider both service 
effectiveness and service efficiency. 
Summing up, none of the mentioned service productivity models covers all rele-
vant aspects of service productivity assessment. Therefore, a novel productivity mod-
el is needed for assessing product-service systems performance. Especially due to the 
complex nature of product-service systems, identifying levers and interrelations of 
combined quantitative and qualitative factors is crucial for a focused improvement of 
a service manifestation from service provider as well as customer point of view. The 
systematical assessment of service efficiency and service effectiveness in a practica-
ble manner is at utmost importance.

Development of a Novel Service Productivity Model 
3.1 
Conceptual Considerations 
Existing service productivity models intend to cover all service branches of a compa-
ny and thereby to cover a heterogeneous spectrum of services within a company. Also 
the productivity assessments proposed by these models attempt to consider the whole 
company. One of the problems arising from this global point of view is that potential 
improvements inherent in the optimization of a single or a similar service process 
remains unexploited. Our approach is therefore to analyze a single service and to 
identify levers for improving the service provision and thus the productivity of the 
service for future services of the same type. 
Nevertheless, the goal is to develop a generic model that is able to cover all servic-
es of a company. The transition from the generic model to a practical use in the con-
text of productivity assessment of an individual service is done by a company-specific 
or even service-specific instantiation of our model. By operationalizing the model, it 
loses its generic nature and becomes applicable in practice. 
Therefore, to develop the new service productivity model, a two-stage approach 
was used. First, a generic model was developed. By providing a systematic procedure 
to operationalize the productivity model, it becomes usable in the second step. 
3.2 
Development of a Comprehensive Model of Service Productivity 
The comprehensive model of service productivity covers the specific characteristics 
of services illustrated in section 2 and transfers them into a generic model represen-
ting the individual relations and components of a service provision. Here, the basic 
structuring concept is the generally accepted division of a service in the potential, 
process, and outcome dimension [8]. On the next level, value drivers are identified in 
each dimension of service provision, contributing to the success of the service. These 
value drivers are not represented by specific factors, since this would violate the ge-
neral approach of the basic model. Rather, these value drivers are formulated as  
abstract factors that represent the essential characteristics and elements of a service 
provision, but are not further operationalized within the basic model. The value driv-
ers can be assigned to one or several classes of value drivers in terms of their  
manifestation: 
1. Value drivers addressing the service provider 
2. Value drivers addressing the service customer 
3. Value drivers addressing both the service provider and the service customer in their 
cooperative service provision 
4. Value drivers describing concrete intermediate or final results of the service provi-
sion 
5. Value drivers describing agreed or expected intermediate or final results of the ser-
vice provision 
6. Value drivers addressing quantitative aspects of service provision 
7. Value drivers addressing qualitative aspects of service provision 

 
Development and Evaluation of a Novel Service Productivity Model 
389 
 
Due to their abstract character, value drivers represent factors having a direct impact 
on the productivity of a service, but cannot be directly influenced by the service man-
agement. 
The value drivers in the model constitute the course of service provision across all 
three dimensions. In the potential dimension, value drivers represent the service  
provider’s as well as the service customer’s input factors and the resulting joint wil-
lingness to perform the service. The transition to the process dimension starts as the 
organizational willingness’s of the provider and customer are brought together in a 
commitment of a single willingness to provide the service. In the process dimension 
in contrast to the potential dimension a division into customer and provider is not 
made due to the cooperative nature of the service provision process. Thus, the process 
dimension is divided in a quantitative and a qualitative performance share. Here, the 
quantitative or qualitative provided services as well as the agreed or expected services 
have to be considered. This division is reflected in the outcome dimension, which 
represents the result of the service provision. In comparison with the process dimen-
sion the identical division of the service result in a qualitative and a quantitative share 
is combined to a total score in the outcome dimension, which describes the overall 
success of the service. From this overall success the added value of the service pro-
vider and the service customer can be deduced resulting in a separation of the provi-
der and the customer at the end of service provision. 
To represent partial service productivities, success criteria are defined, describing 
the relation of two value drivers. Success criteria can be differentiated in: 
1. Success criteria between directly related value drivers represent measures of the  
efficiency of the underlying service 
2. Success criteria between unconnected value drivers represent the dimension of  
effectiveness of the underlying service 
Success criteria representing efficiency can be found within the potential dimension. 
Here, they specify how efficient the willingness to perform is hold available in regard 
to the total potential of the service provider and customer. Furthermore, success crite-
ria representing efficiency exist between the process and the potential dimension as 
well as between the outcome and the potential dimension. These factors express how 
efficiently the service was provided on the basis of the joint willingness to perform. 
Effectiveness criteria can be found within all dimensions of service provision. In 
the potential dimension a success criteria is defined to assess the effectiveness of the 
division of willingness to perform between provider and customer. In the process 
dimension the compliance of the actual partial, partial service results and the agreed 
or expected service results is assessed by respective success criteria of effectiveness. 
This effectiveness assessment is reflected in the outcome dimension to the overall 
result of the service as depicted in Figure 1. 
The basic model of service productivity thus describes the complete service deli-
very process from the provider’s and the customer's perspectives, takes into account 
the qualitative and quantitative components of service provision and describes the 
partial productivities of the service provision through success criteria of efficiency 
and effectiveness. All constructs of the basic model, however, are not directly tangible 

390 
A. Petz et al. 
 
and measurable in practice; they form an abstract representation of a product-service 
system. To transfer the model into a fully operational form, both the value drivers as 
well as the success criteria have to be operationalized. 
Our new service productivity model is depicted in Figure 1, showing value drivers 
and success criteria as well as the starting points to operationalize the model by as-
signing influence factors and key figures. 
3.3 
Method for Operationalization of the Comprehensive Service  
Productivity Model 
The operationalization of the value drivers is performed by defining factors directly 
influencing the specific value driver. These influence factors represent parameters of 
the service that can be controlled by service managers and thus show a company- or 
even service-specific characteristic. 
To quantify the partial productivities represented by the success criteria they are 
substantiated in key figures. Key figures hereby have to be quantifiable, collectable 
with reasonable effort, relevant, and preferably up to date [2], [20]. In addition, only 
those indicators are to be considered, which allow for a comparability of different 
services of the same company. 
An accurate definition of the key figures results in the possibility to identify poten-
tials for improvement directly during service provision. By linking key figures and 
influence factors with the help of our generic model of service productivity, a direct 
determination of the crucial levers for optimizing individual facets of service produc-
tivity and correspondingly organize future provisions of similar services in a more 
productive way becomes possible. Normalizing and weighting the key figures enables 
an overall productivity assessment of the service provision. 
4 
Evaluation of the Service Productivity Model by Experts 
In order to evaluate the proposed service productivity model, data from explorative 
interviews with 32 service experts from two engineering companies in Germany are 
used. The data were accompanied by validation workshops of the proposed novel 
service productivity model. 
The interview notes were analyzed and categorized following an approach pro-
posed by Mayring (2007). The categorization was conducted on the basis of a coding 
scheme. The results were interpreted by their frequency of occurrence of each catego-
ry among the interviewee. This step aimed to filter relevant aspects from the gathered 
data in order of their importance. 
The analysis of the main sections of the semi-structured interviews revealed seven 
key influence factor categories. These seven categories represent the most commonly 
made statements in the interviews and are applicable to all value drivers of our service 
productivity model. Two of the categories – motivation and qualification – can further 
be subdivided in a service provider and a service customer perspective. The categories 
of influence factors on service productivity can further be classified according to their 
mostly qualitative and mostly quantitative characteristic (see Figure 2).

The weighting of these categories can be derived from the frequency of responses 
within each category. The results show differences between the two companies in 
some aspects, but also similarities in other aspects. This indicates that a company-
specific instantiation of our service productivity model is essential.

Conclusions and Outlook  
Based on findings from literature, a novel productivity assessment model is proposed. 
The model combines all relevant characteristics of services as well as of productivity 
assessment in a holistic concept. The model provides guidance for practitioners in 
order to specify their own success factors and key figures for product-service system 
management and improvement. 
In order to prospectively evaluate the performance of a service, a prototypical work 
process simulation system is currently developed. The simulation system will be able 
to cope with service-specific characteristics, such as customer influence and uncer-
tainty of the service provision as well as the characteristics of weakly structured work 
processes such as iterations and overlapping tasks. 
Both, the work process simulation and the comprehensive service productivity 
model provide a process oriented, dynamic evaluation of service systems for a more 
reliable and realistic forecast of product-service systems performance. Service opera-
tions managers will be able to prospectively evaluate different service scenarios by 
visualizing the outcome of different service settings under the variation of systemati-
cally identified influence factors.

Abstract. Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) are promising approaches 
to realize different customer requirements. The built-up Microfactory is a result 
of a cooperation of Japanese research institutes and will be focused in this pa-
per. The paper identifies two categories of relevant service shares for the Micro-
factory. The general service shares for Microfactory cover basic requirements. 
These distinguish general service shares form complex service shares to fulfill 
customer specific requirements. Examples for both categories of service shares 
for Microfactory, are presented. Finally different scenarios can be described 
under consideration of specific selection of general and complex service shares 
to fulfill customer requirements. 
Keywords: Microfactory, General Service Shares, Complex Service Shares.

Introduction 
The Microfactory [1] is developed by AIST as a modern compact and distributed 
manufacturing system. This system allows a flexible combination of different manu-
facturing, assembly and measuring procedures. It was introduced 12 years ago. Vari-
ous machine tools and production equipment to fulfill the different tasks covered by 
the Microfactory have been developed and introduced in the market. One of the re-
markable characteristics of the system is the high level of modularity. The modularity 
allows the minimization as individual products by employing particular downsizing 
technologies and the fulfillment of customer-specific solutions [2]. There have been 
some significant approaches [3] to cover industrial practicalities by utilizing high 
modularity of the Microfactories. However, sometimes the modularity has also pre-
vented the provider of the Microfactory from promoting the system-level innovation 
of their business, since it is difficult to develop a new business model beyond combin-
ing the provided modules. This is the reason why there is no common strategy or 
framework to make the provider’s business successful. Facing the recent serious eco-
nomic situation, on top of severe global competition and environmental legislation, 
service engineering and especially industrial product-service systems (IPS²) can be a 
key to overcome the underlying challenges by creating more innovative businesses 
and sustainable, customer individual combinations of product and service shares

[2, 4]. Different business models, which are coupled with the customer requirements, 
are available for such a provider [2, 4, 5]. One important aspect of market acceptance 
and therefore success of an industrial solution is the integration of product and service 
shares over a continuous lifecycle [2, 4]. In a former paper [6], basic ideas for service 
shares have been listed corresponding to the characteristics of the product shares and 
IPS²-lifecycle stages [4]. In this paper, the identified service shares will be categorized 
to two defined types; general service shares and complex service shares. The objective 
of this paper is to propose an appropriate method to categorize those two and show a 
systematic approach to design IPS² featuring Microfactory. Additionally, some industri-
al examples will be discussed to verify the reasonability of the categorization.

Product Shares and Characteristics of Microfactories 
2.1 
The Microfactory 
The Microfactory combines different product shares, which are realized by machine 
tools, measuring systems and other production equipment. In the first prototype of the 
Microfactory [1], the total system was composed of five components. Thus, at the 
first look, the five micro production machine tools correspond to the basic product 
shares in the system (see also [6]). 
The product shares, indicated from 1 to 5, measuring systems and other production 
equipments are integrated in the concept of the Microfactory (Figure 1):

2.2 
Capability of the Microfactory 
The Microfactory is a compact production system for precise microproducts [1, 7]. 
However, a concrete definition has not been discussed thoroughly. Thus, the authors, 
hereby, define Microfactory by the following sentences: “A production system which 
is composed of properly downsized machine tools and other production equipment 
and realize at least one feature of a workpiece, such as tolerances, dimensions etc., 
with a `micron order´ requirement.” Based on the concept, the developed Microfacto-
ry had some merits comparing to normal size production system, as shown in Table 1. 
And these merits can be the key to clarify capability of the Microfactory along with 
the product and service shares of it.

Based on an existing definition [4], it has been stated that a lifecycle of an IPS² can 
be divided into five stages. Those are IPS²-planning, IPS²-development, IPS²-
realization (or IPS²-implementation), IPS²-use and IPS²-reuse (or IPS²-end-of-life 
management).  Potential merits of a Microfactory are related to the different IPS²-
lifecycle stages. Because of the smallness of the machine, it might be possible to use 
more modularized components and a simple design technique without any necessary 
critical simulation. By this aspect it is also possible to easily change the factory layout 
and add new components to the production line. Thus, time for the development process 
can be reduced (see Table 1). For the design aspect the degree of material use and parts 
use is usually small. Thus, if the machine tools and other production equipment are 
composed of commercially available components, the costs are lower. Since the ma-
chine tools and other production equipment sizes are small and work-loads are small, a 
low degree of secondary processes such as providing coolants, lubrication and spare 
parts is necessary (see Table 1). As an existing study [9] shows, modularized compact 
production systems can be energy efficient e. g. by designing process time of each  
modular unit consistently. Corresponding to the flexibility in the factory layout and 
modularity of the machines, it is possible to increase or decrease the number of machine

tools and other production equipment and change production line configurations. Due to 
the smallness of the machine tools and other production equipment, it is possible to 
move the whole or the part of the production lines to where demands exist. Because of 
the size effects of various error factors in machine tools and other production equip-
ment, a downsized machine tool has clear advantages, e. g. in the aspect of theoretical 
positioning errors [10]. The smallness of the machine tools and other production equip-
ment leads to the characteristic that some error factors may decrease its’ effect on the 
overall positioning error. The smallness can also realize reduced process time such as 
e. g. warming up, heat treatment and cooling down. Because of the smallness of the 
machine tools and other production equipment, moving components of the machine 
tools and other production equipment may not hurt operators accidently (see Table 1)

Service Shares of the Microfactory 
3.1 
List of the Service Shares 
Since service shares of IPS2 relate to characteristics of the product shares, basic ser-
vice shares of the Microfactory can be listed as a reflection of the potential merits [6]. 
For example, “Mobility” enables “on-site pay-per-production service” which can 
never been realized by a normal size production system. Or, “Fast-design” can lead us

Service Shares for Microfactory to Ensure Industrial Product-Service Systems 
399 
 
to think of “Factory layout design service.” “Safety” feature will be a good character 
to enable and promote “training of machine operation service,” and so on. 
In addition, considerations on the IPS2-lifecycle stages may lead to much more 
ideas of service shares and identify connections between different service shares. For 
example, “Fast-design” feature can be helpful to offer “Marketing service” in the 
IPS2-planning stage, since “Fast-design” will surely decrease the lead time to the 
market which is one of the most important features when we carry out marketing of 
products. And of course, “Compact” which is the common characteristics of all  
product shares enables “Implementation of the production set-up service” in the IPS2-
realization stage. Through these consideration and discussion, a basic list of the  
service shares of the Microfactory was discussed in the former paper [6]. The service 
shares were also related to system integration level of service activities, since it is also 
an important criterion to consider service shares [6]. 
3.2   Criteria of Service Shares 
In order to categorize service shares, first a good characterization will be necessary. 
An existing literature [10] is proposing criteria and characteristics of service shares as 
Table 2. Since these criteria are generalized to be applied to pure service shares or 
services offered to general customers, some modifications will be necessary to apply 
the criteria to IPS².  It is also necessary to eliminate overlaps and dependent criteria, 
since the paper will try to evaluate and categorize service shares by using the selected 
criteria. The first point which can be easily noticed is, “product relationship,” “prod-
uct connection” and “contact force” are describing similar characteristics. These crite-
ria indicated how deeply the service shares depend on the product shares. So, in this 
paper, we integrate these three to one; “impact from product shares.” The next point 
to be discussed is “service utilization.” Although this is an important criterion to cha-
racterize service shares, in cases of IPS², the services are always utilized by producers 
to fulfill the customers’ requirements. Thus, this criterion is unnecessary. “Applica-
tion area” means whether the service is realized only by an internal effort, or not. In 
this paper, this point is described by “number of providers.” Two criteria “exclusion 
of the demand” and “customer integration” are expressing similar things. Both indi-
cate whether the receivers of the services are consistent, or not. The paper unifies 
them to “integration level of customers.” Again, the criterion “operation factor” is not 
applicable to IPS², since this indicates the service is realized by a product or a human, 
and in a case of IPS², any service has relevancy to a product. “Business functional 
area” identifies the service can be available in which stage of service lifecycle. In the 
case of IPS2, this characteristic is described as “relevancy to IPS2-lifecycle stages” 
which was mentioned in the authors’ other work [7]. About “contractual relationship,” 
it is not a primary criterion for service shares, since there can be many varieties of 
contract. Finally, “individuality” indicates how services can be standardized. Thus, 
the paper translates this criterion as “process sequence complexity.”

In addition, as it was shown in Table 2, the authors think that the “system integra-
tion level” is also an important criterion to characterize service shares. As the result of 
unification and translation, the paper has determined six criteria to characterize ser-
vice shares for microfactory. The six criteria are “impact from product shares,” 
“number of providers,” “customer integration level,” “relevancy to IPS2-lifecycle 
phases,” “process sequence complexity” and “system integration level.” 
3.3 
Complexity of the Service Shares 
Based on the list shown in Figure 2 of identified service shares, a determination of the 
complexity of the service shares was carried out. In order to carry out the determination, 
six criteria were discussed and selected in the former section. Table 3 and 4 are the re-
sults of the determination of the complexity of the service shares by considering six 
criteria.

Categorization of the Service Shares 
Based on our definition in this paper, general service shares are the service shares that 
can be standardized and be seen commonly in many IPS². Complex service shares are 
those which are more specific services shares than general service shares to fulfill 
more complex and various requirements of customers. Since complexity is a relative 
aspect, tentatively, we categorized service shares that have high scores in more than 
four criteria to complex service shares, and the rest to general service shares. In gen-
eral, the purposes of the categorization of service shares are to build-up a new service, 
or to optimize an existing service. These two objectives might be realized by modifi-
cations of the service shares to more complex shares. But, it can be also possible by 
simplifications. Thus, categorizing them to two categories can be a good start point to 
know how complexity plays a role. As the final result led from Table 3 and 4, these 
are the list of general service shares and complex service shares of the Micorfactory. 
• General service shares: training of machine operation, financing, factory layout 
planning, product development, CAD/CAM, integration of parts inspection, tech-
nology consulting,  condition monitoring, spare parts/units exchange, measuring 
tasks, quality control, certification, on-site pay per production, process optimiza-
tion, end-of-life management (dump) 
• Complex service shares: marketing, marketing(second-hand), controlling, envi-
ronmental (analysis, ensuring), production (fabrication, assembly, logistics), 
tool/consumables provisioning and management, ensure/enable operation, condi-
tion based maintenance, maintenance, end-of-life management(remanufacturing)

Industrial Examples 
5.1 
Training of Machine Tool User 
To train machine tool user in the skill of usage of the machine tool is a typical service 
offered by machine tool manufacturer. However, one of the problems in current  

404 
N. Mishima and H. Komoto 
 
training service is that the offered skill is sometimes specific to the machine tool. It is 
often observed that machine shops have many types of machine tools from many 
producers. Thus, if it is possible to unite an IPS²-network to offer certain combina-
tions of machine training, it would fulfill the requirements of customers who have 
many types of machine tool in a floor. This modification of service shares is equiva-
lent to change the complexity level in “number of providers” (see Table 2) from  
single to multi. In this case, the optimization of the service can be achieved by  
complexity. 
5.2 
Factory Layout Planning 
There is a Japanese machine tool manufacturer [11] which makes a relatively compact 
and multi-functional machine tool. Since their machine tools are multi-functional, 
there are a lot of varieties in manufacturing processes and configuration of machine 
shops. Thus, the company is not only selling the product but also trying to consult 
their customers in machine shop floor planning. However, if an IPS²-provider can 
offer not only the layout existing machine tools, but also a new design of custom 
made machine tools to meet their customers’ various requirements, the service share 
will be much more attractive. This modification can be led by changing “relevancies 
to life cycle stages” (see Table 1) from single to multi. In the existing eservice share, 
corresponding IPS2-lifecycle stage is limited to IPS2-realization. But, in the modified 
case, IPS2-planning and IPS2-development stages are relevant. In this case, the build-
up of new service can be also achieved by making the service more complex. 
5.3 
On-Site Production of Medical Devices 
Contract manufacturing is a well-observed service in manufacturing industries. In a 
contract manufacturing, usually the service provider designs the manufacturing 
process and often designs the product, and of course the production system. The ser-
vice is relevant to IPS2-development and IPS2-use stages. Usually this service can 
only applied to mass-production. On the other hand, a compact production system like 
Microfactory is aiming production in smaller batch and there are some demands for 
more specific outsourcing of production. “On-site pay-per-production” using Micro-
factory can be a solution. One example is on-site manufacturing of medical devices 
[12]. In this example, a screw to connect broken bones is made on-site (in the hospit-
al) by patient’s own bone. Since there is no pre-set design to be commonly applied to 
various conditions of patients, every product design and process design is carried out 
during the IPS2-use phase only. Thus, this is an example to build-up a new service 
share by simplification.

Summary 
In this paper, one of the first ideas to apply service shares to a compact modular man-
ufacturing set-up called the Microfactory is discussed. The paper first identified the

405 
 
general merits of the Microfactory, and listed basic product shares featuring those 
merits.  
Furthermore, the paper tried to categorize the basic examples of service shares for 
the Microfactory which has been listed through existing papers. The service shares 
were characterized and categorized to general service shares and complex service 
shares, based on the complexity level indicated by six different criteria. By this cate-
gorization, the service providers can know which criteria of complexities are low. 
Which of complexity or simplicity is helpful to build-up or to optimize new services 
depends on cases. Thus, the first step to develop a framework to create a new service 
is a proper categorization of the service shares.  
Through the discussion of industrial examples, it was suggested that build-up or 
improvement of service shares can be possible by changing complexity. Finally, the 
paper concluded that IPS² featuring the Microfactory can be a promising area, since 
the production system can be optimized by various service shares in manufacturing 
industries. And strategic categorization of service shares will be the key to create new 
IPS2 business models featuring the Mircofactory. 
As a future work, the proposed categorization method should be verified by using 
more industrial examples and relations between general service shares and complex 
service shares must be clarified to answer a research question "is there a common 
method to build-up or optimize a new service share?” In addition, more detailed  
characterization of service shares to standardize general service shares might be  
necessary.

Abstract. This paper presents a case study containing five mini-cases within a 
service provider of complex hardware with long operation times. The study  
describes how a structured approach of development, implementation and oper-
ation of total service solutions (TSS) can contribute to customization and flex-
ibility on the one hand and standardization and synergies on the other hand. The 
basic shape of the organization might change in the beginning of a journey  
towards TSS. However it might also change back when the solution is imple-
mented. Modules in routines can facilitate managing different external regula-
tions. Further, the service structure can be described via a work breakdown 
structure and it is possible to simulate different scenarios based on such a struc-
ture. Fleet management might be a new capability needed, and it has been rea-
lized that in the relevant sector the dynamic capability development of service 
solutions can be more front-loaded than proposed from other researchers. 
Keywords: service solution, service structure, long product life-cycle, dynamic 
capability.

Introduction 
Many long life products, from power turbines, to airplanes, have a large installed base 
(IB) which consequently brings a huge market for maintenance, repair and overhaul 
(MRO) and other aftermarket activities. It is not unusual that the installed base of 
capital goods exceeds the annual flow of new products by 10 to 100 times [1]. In the 
United States the installed-base-to-new-unit ratio for civil aircrafts was 150 to 1 at the 
end of the 1990s [1]. Hence, the aviation industry is a particularly promising case 
from an aftermarket perspective. Deregulations during the 1970s made it even more 
interesting for both provider and customer. Before the 1970s many airlines had their 
own in-house MRO operations, but after the deregulations new independent suppliers 
have emerged to offer lower costs services.  
In this environment with intensive competition among both airliners and MRO 
suppliers, new extended service solutions are developed and so called Product-Service 
Solutions (PSS) with a comprehensive content have emerged [2]. However, new and 
improved service offerings are continuously emerging also in several other sectors 
and according to Sakao et al. [3] service solutions may reduce 30-40% of the total 
product life-cycle cost for a customer. In such an environment with new service  

408

solutions on a market with great competition, providers also compete on an “extended 
installed base”, an installed base not manufactured by the service provider. Conse-
quently, in a fast-moving business environment, sustainable advantage requires more 
than ownership of difficult-to-replicate asset, it also requires difficult-to-replicate 
dynamic capabilities [4]. Dynamic capabilities indicate flexibility and customization. 
At the same time reproducibility is needed and some structure ought to exist [5-8]. 
However, few empirical studies have analyzed the development and implementa-
tion process regarding services in product-based firms [3], [9]. Thus there is a need to 
identify where and when firms generate, evaluate, and realize various types of service 
innovations and improvements, relating to e.g. service modularity, organizational 
changes, and the need to balance cost-efficient operations and standardized processes 
with customization and flexibility [3]. 
1.1 
Purpose 
This paper focuses on how a capital goods industry with long product life-cycles  
(aircraft services) exploit on total-service solutions. This context implies that the 
hardware is fixed and that operations are strictly regulated for safety reasons. Many 
providers expand on their offerings and the key question for them is to understand the 
potential and limitations for a structured and comprehensive approach to service  
solutions in this context. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to analyze how a 
structured approach can contribute to practicing providers and to the academia, when 
a provider of complex hardware with long operation time develops, implements, and 
operates TSS. This is specified in a research question:  
Research Question: How can a structured approach of development, implementation 
and operation of TSS contribute to customization and flexibility on the one hand and 
standardization and synergies on the other hand?

Theoretical Framework 
The great potential for reduced product life costs through total-service solutions 
brings an interest in many businesses [3]. The incentives are often economical with 
increased revenue for the provider of the services respectively decreased costs for the 
customer, i.e. the system operator. The incentives for the provider to move towards 
extended service solutions can be higher revenue but also an increased possibility to 
even out the cyclicality of revenues, to gain on untapped markets or becoming a stra-
tegic business partner [1], [10-11].  
2.1 
Structures in Service Solutions Providing Organisations 
According to a resource-based view, observable differences regarding performance 
between different firms can primarily be drawn back to the different resources availa-
ble [12]. However, resources need to be managed and synchronized [13]. Hence, it is

here suggested that being able to efficiently produce services a firm needs human and 
non-human resources, an organizational shape, including the way of working, infor-
mation and some input to refine. Winter [14] defines organizational capability as a 
high-level routine (or collection of routines) that, together with its implementing input 
flows, confers upon an organization’s management a set of decision options for pro-
ducing sufficient outputs of a particular type. Those high-level routines would prefer-
able be denominated main processes. Typical main-process in a service providing 
company could be e.g. “develop” or “execute”. For a service solution providing or-
ganization a typical main-process would be “provide service solution” or “solutions 
fulfillment”. By contrast, capabilities that would change the service, the service 
process, the scale or market are not just capabilities; they are dynamic capabilities 
[14]. A dynamic capability view is not without skepticism [14-15], but it attempts to 
explain how a firm can achieve sustained superior performance in a rapidly changing 
industry [4].  
Organizational Structure. “Firms and markets co-evolve” [16] (p 1198). This is true 
at least for sustaining successful firms. Service providing organizations require differ-
ent processes, cultures, leadership, and structures than manufacturing organizations 
[17]. Consequently many solution providers add independent customer-centric units 
to the existing product-centric units [18-19]. Structurally, the providing organization 
needs to centralize and coordinate customer-centric front-end units and flexible  
capability in resource back-end units [20], [5]. Working together towards better cus-
tomers’ total experience as well as trust and greater customer loyalty becomes more 
important [21]. Further, when the service solution is up and running the customer-
centric units might be moved back to the mother organization [18].  
Capabilities. Also new abilities might be relevant when moving towards TSS. Typi-
cal skills needed are project management, key accounting, team selling, and conflict 
management [9], [22]. However, even more important is the ability to capture client 
needs and to transfer them into profitable actions. Successful solutions providers 
manage to balance the tensions between client needs and capabilities [5]. It is the 
ability to take clients insight and small capability edges to build on, that enables creat-
ing great solutions. Still, even if a provider masters the act of balancing tensions be-
tween client needs and capabilities, a provider has always some limitations regarding 
capabilities and resources. Experienced suppliers of service systems, e.g. IBM, some-
times integrates rival´s subsystems into their offerings. Further, firms completely 
based in services have to rely on product sellers to provide a reliable source of prod-
ucts and technology [23]. 
Dynamic Capabilities. Teece [4] mentions that the traditional elements of business 
success are often specified in terms of maintaining incentive alignment, owning tang-
ible assets, controlling costs, maintaining quality, optimizing inventories, etc. Howev-
er, Teece [4] continues with arguing that in a dynamic business environment with a 
global competition the traditional elements of business success are still necessary, but 
hardly sufficient for sustained first-rate enterprise performance. Enterprise success 

410 
J. Sandin 
 
rather depends upon the discovery and development of new opportunities. Dynamic 
capabilities can be defined as the capabilities that operate to extend, modify or create 
ordinary capabilities [14]. One example is new service development, which reasona-
bly is affected by the IB (or Extended IB). 
The capacity to sense and shape opportunities and threats, to seize opportunities 
and also to maintain competitiveness through combining, enhancing and protecting 
reconfiguring tangible and intangible assets are crucial in a dynamic environment [4], 
[24]. The essential coordination task according to the dynamic capabilities framework 
described by Augier and Teece [16] is internal to the firm, but it might involve stra-
tegic alliances as well. “The fundamental question for management is to figure out 
how best to employ the firm´s existing assets, and how to reconfigure and augment 
the value proposition being brought to customers” [16] (p 1197). 
Galunic and Rodan [25] suggest that recombination can occur when competencies 
within the firm are combined to synthesize novel competencies, but also when compe-
tencies experience a reconfiguration or relinking with other competencies. Further, 
recombination of competencies can be complemented with recombinative innovations 
which exploit the possibility opened up by applying new combinations of technical 
characteristics. The innovation can either be an initiation of a new product by combin-
ing the characteristics of two or more existing products, or it can be initiating new 
products through splitting up an existing product [26]. 
Processes. The solutions fulfillment process show great differences compared with 
product delivery. Services are created in connection with the customer, an infrastruc-
ture needs to be in place, and the operation is people intensive [24].  
The solutions development process consists basically of two sub-processes, one for 
deciding what to develop and one for developing [9]. The involvement of customers 
and users are often intensive throughout the complete development process. It is 
common that lead users are deeply involved with customized offerings as result [27]. 
The process is often less front-loaded than in product development and the focus is 
more on rollout than on early phases [27]. This implies that understanding the cus-
tomer process is crucial. Largely important is also to design a user friendly process 
easy for the customer to learn [28]. 
Capabilities are built by building blocks, for example routines [29] and processes.  
Routines are organizational practices. Hence, improved routines imply both small 
steps towards improved main processes and improved capabilities. 
In a broad sense routine refers to simple decision rules that require low level of in-
formation processing but also to complex, automatic behaviors involving high levels 
of repetitive information processing [29]. Still, routines do not only represent problem 
solving and coordination procedures, but also control and governance devices [29].  
2.2 
Service Solution Structures 
Service Engineering is a technical-methodical approach with the intention to structure 
service development and operations [30-32]. The aim is to intensifying, improving, 
and automating the complete scope of creation, delivery, and consumptions of  

 
Structuring Industrial Service Solutions

services [30]. Earlier attempts to explore and describe this area have been done and 
some models have been proposed for that purpose.  
Several methods, models and tools exist [6], [30-34] but will not be accounted for 
in detail here. One of the methods for structuring services relies on four major steps. 
In the first, all services are classified according to their objectives. Secondly, the ser-
vices are subdivided into various modules consisting of result modules, process mod-
ules and resource modules. Thirdly, modules are classified in mandatory and optional 
modules, and finally the dependencies between the modules are determined [6]. 
Another similar description is made by Bullinger et al. [31] in which a service is  
characterized by the dimensions structure, process and outcome. The structure is con-
nected to resources (humans, material and immaterial resources).  
Dynamic Structures. The most successful solutions are often found were the provid-
ers can tailor their offerings to the precise needs of a particular client [5], [35]. But 
truly customizing the solutions will also be expensive and some kind of reusing is 
preferable.  Hence, modular solution platforms can be useful for many providers and 
ought to be considered in connection to the development of a service system and its 
structure [5-7]. To optimizing the customization and using a modular solution plat-
form, the provider must build up some learning experiences [5].  
One great challenge is to design a service system for reproducibility but with flex-
ibility enough to recognize and adapt to differences in e.g. regulations, legal systems 
and culture [8]. Gremyr et al. [9] has identified recombinative innovations as a suc-
cess factor. It enables new possibilities to combine customization and standardization. 
Recombinative innovations exploit the possibility opened up by applying new combi-
nations of technical characteristics. The innovations can either be initiating new prod-
ucts through splitting up an existing product, or an initiation of a new product by 
combining the characteristics of two or more existing products [26]. Innovation can 
also regard formalization. Formalization innovation concerns standardization and 
visibility of various characteristics [26].  
2.3 
Theoretical Framework Summarized 
In the theoretical framework it has been discussed and made credibly that both orga-
nizational capability and service solutions needs a structure. It has also been indicated 
that there is an even greater potential if the structures are dynamic, but with control.

Research Method and Cases 
The paper is based on an ongoing longitudinal case study. So far the data collection 
has been concentrated to two periods, one during winter 2010/2011 and one in spring 
2012. The first data collection was a pilot study on one (Case C) of five mini cases 
within the longitudinal case study. The second data collection was the first in a com-
ing range of data collections. Valuable background information concerning the  
 

412

division and its businesses is available to the researcher, since he was an employee at 
some related divisions during the years 2001-2009. 
The unit of analysis is a division with approximately 110 employees within a large 
product-based, high-technology business corporation with approximately 10,000 em-
ployees. This organization is constantly in an evolvement and approximately four 
months before the second data collection period, the division was merged with anoth-
er service providing division.  
The case was chosen mainly on four criteria; capital goods, long product life cycle, 
service innovations and strive for a generic TSS possible to offer to other than the 
providing company’s own installed base. Two of the TSS mini cases were initiated 
long before the study started, one had just been implemented, and the other two was 
implemented during the study. See Table 1 for more details.  
The data was collected via semi structured interviews with open ended  
questions. The interviews were focused to the service champions [24] and each inter-
view took between 1.5-2.5 hours. All interviews were recorded and transcribed by the 
same person who did the interviews. The analysis was primarily accomplished by 
identifying patterns, in an iterative process derived from the literature and comparing 
with similar cases reported elsewhere. Particular attention was paid to how the  
development, structuring, implementation and improvement of the new offering were 
done. 
3.1 
The Cases 
Even though the product platforms have differed largely between the cases, the pro-
vider has been able to reuse the experiences and the major parts of the scope between 
the different businesses. The scope of the first business (Case A) was new to both the 
provider and the military customer and involved great challenges. The platforms in 
Case A were two different types of civilian airplanes. Hence, the customers operation 
is military but the Extended IB is civilian. In this Special Flights Operation the pro-
vider both prepares and flies the airplanes.  
When moving to the next TSS business (Case B) the customer is civilian and the 
provider does not fly, but the rest of the scope was relatively similar to Case A. Case 
C was originally initiated in another division than the division operating Case A and 
B. Here, the intention was to buy the IB back from the customer and to offer a total 
service solution including everything except flying the aircrafts. However, the product 
platform is a military airplane and buying military equipment in Sweden is not realis-
tic for private company, but the rest of the scope was actuated. In Case C the IB had 
been manufactured by the provider several decades ago. The customer in Case D uses 
several different platforms consisting of both airplanes and helicopters. The scope is 
similar to the former cases. The platform in Case E is a military helicopter and also 
this scope is similar to the former cases.

Results 
In the Cases A and B the incentives for the provider to move towards TSS was to 
secure a continuation of contracts that was running out, to enlarge the scope and 
thereby the turnover and also to even out cyclic variations over a year. 
Case C was initiated in another division than Case A and B. There were three ma-
jor incentives for the provider (Case C) to move towards total service solutions. The 
first was to extend the product lifecycle. The system had been in operations since the 
middle of the 1960s and the customer considered closing it down. The second was an 
aim of having a leading role in the transition toward changed operations for the cus-
tomer, which was a pronounced goal. The third was to obtain experiences and refer-
ences of total service solutions operations. The provider had made a strategic decision 
to expand the total service solution operations, both to gain scale economy advan-
tages, and to win new market shares and thereby increasing the turnover. Case C was 
planned to be a pilot-case for a considerably larger service solution on a more modern 
and complex platform dominating the complete providing organization.  
During the development and implementation of Case C the interest for a service 
solution for the modern and complex platform decreased partly. Hence, that service 
solution has not been implemented yet. As a consequence the aims changed somewhat 
and the sight was set on the great possibilities on helicopters. The provider judged that 
the military helicopter market had great potential, but a reference helicopter business 
was needed on this Extended IB. Case D is a civilian customer who operates both 
helicopters and airplanes. Hence, Case D was a useful reference for the military heli-
copter businesses. Case E is based on a military helicopter fleet implemented in Janu-
ary 2012. This is the first out of totally three helicopter platforms, outsourced by 
FMV and the total potential turnover is extensive.

division for total service solutions were developed. Added to this new division were 
some parts from the customer’s organisation. The customer didn´t need all the front-
end offices anymore and at the same time the provider needed both the competences 
and the hardware. Still, not all of the operation was incorporated to the division. Two 
major sub-suppliers remained. One service champion mentioned that after implement-
ing all the five TSS businesses (2012), the prerequisites have changed compared with 
having fewer TSS, and choosing to outsource is not equally obvious anymore. 
The organisation did not change much as a consequence of Case D and E. Some 
new front-offices were integrated. However, in parallel with implementation of Case 
D a road map for a new BU organization was designed. The new organization was 
implemented almost simultaneously as Case E was secured. Now, the division operat-
ing total service solution was merged with some new parts of the BU. The new divi-
sion contains several more businesses and front-offices, but also several similarities 
compared with the division created 2006 when Case B was to be launched. 
4.2 
Capabilities and Structure 
During the development of the TSS in Case C it was realized that the customer re-
quired information different from the previous product portfolio. The customer wants 
to select the service elements for himself. Hence, the capabilities from the running 
businesses A and B were formalized and combined into a capability portfolio to facili-
tate detailed discussions with the customer. This capability portfolio is described 
through a generic six armed work breakdown structure (WBS). It is applied to the 
unique business through activating or inactivating each cell in the WBS, and state-
ment of work, organization, and calculations are connected to the active cells. The 
interviewed service champions expressed great satisfaction for this way of working. It 
was mentioned that this WBS has a great importance throughout all the phases for the 
transition to and operation of TSS. 
After the baseline and the business model for the TSS were defined, the baseline 
could be adapted to the unique businesses. The adaption was done more or less in 
parallel with sales in an iterative process. Here, the final choices of detailed solutions 
were made by the customer and parts from the capability portfolio were combined and 
formalized by the provider. In the extended service solutions the requirements have 
increased partly on some cells in the WBS, for example program management, key 
accounting, front-end technicians and technical support. However, fleet management 
and handling weapons on the military aircrafts ought to be judged as new capabilities. 
4.3 
New Enabling Capabilities 
In Case A, a radically new capability was co-created together with the customer. For 
the first time a TSS was developed and implemented and a new business model was 
used as a foundation. When Case B was introduced, the step was not equally large. 
The difference from Case A was basically running a civilian TSS as an opposite to 
military. However, the provider also learned how to smoothen out resources between 
the two existing businesses.  

416 
J. Sandin 
 
In Case C it was obvious that endurance was important. There have been discus-
sions between the main actors for several years. Much time and money was spent on 
investigations with fuzzy intentions. A concept was agreed on after roughly 5 years. 
Although the transition in Case C was partly customer driven, the provider expe-
rienced a lack of readiness in parts of the customer organization. Many of the stake-
holders were skeptical to the new business concept, the voice of the end-user was not 
paid enough attention to, and there were difficulties to get access to reliable customer 
data. The latter includes data regarding operations, maintenance, repair, and overhaul 
and also data specific for the follow-up on costs, regulations and certificates. When 
the data was available it was analyzed in a simulation tool developed in connection to 
Case C. In parallel with Case C, also a MRO module was implemented in the business 
administration tool to support the operations. Also a lot effort was made on getting 
extended certificates needed for the operations in Case C. This new capability is how-
ever, not completely generic, it is very much connected to the unique Case C.  
In Case D service solutions were applied on helicopters for the first time and ac-
cording to the interviews, the operations should be up and running within six weeks. 
In Case E another new combination, military operations on helicopters occurred. 
However, it was only the combination that was new; more or less all the service  
components had been used before.  
Summarized, some new crucial capabilities were necessary to enable this journey 
towards being a TSS provider on the market aimed at. 
4.4 
Processes and Routines 
The way of working is based on the capability portfolio as a keystone. Connected to 
this are several routinized activities and below the most obvious are described briefly. 
The service champions simulate the businesses in a business simulation tool. This 
is done both in advance and in parallel with the customer’s selection process. The 
head of the division and even the head of the business unit are involved and have 
detailed knowledge regarding how different parameters affect the businesses.  
Implementation was a great challenge in the cases. Here, description and planning 
of the operations, and to secure certificates has been pointed out as crucial during the 
interviews. One example on the first is that the operation part “Technical support” 
was exposed to new requirements and a formal process description was created to 
cope with this. However, it was also mentioned during the interviews that creating 
one “overall process” for the complete service solution is not possible. Case C is 
somewhat unique. The changed business arrangement resulted in new fields of re-
sponsibility (e.g. weapons). This brought challenges that never had been faced before 
by the customer or the provider. The platform was encumbered with comprehensive 
regulations and to cope with these, formalization were important to enable the  
implementation.  
Other routines with new opportunities are maintenance planning and resource 
planning. Having control over five large TSS operations brings an opportunity to 
smoothening of resources, at least at the back-offices. This was realised already at 
Case B, and the opportunities have increased with the number of TSS´s. The  

 
Structuring Industrial Service Solutions

differences in the military and civilian operations required different education and 
individual certificates, but this was solved. 
Further, when case D was introduced, civilian, military, airplane and helicopter 
regulations according to authority requirements should be obeyed at the same time. In 
the interviewees it was mentioned that the different regulations could be used as  
modules complementing the handbooks.

Discussion 
According to the theoretical framework new product-service providing organizations 
often separates service units from product units, but might move them back together 
when the services are up and running. This was verified in the case. Another structur-
al change in the case was integrating new front-end offices provided from the custom-
ers. Further it was indicated that with a sufficient number of TSS businesses, former 
decisions on outsourcing might be withdrawn. 
According to the theoretical framework successful solution providers needs new 
capabilities and manage to balance the tensions between client needs and the capabili-
ties. In the case this might have been true, however it was more obvious that balanc-
ing client needs (uptime) and maintenance costs was crucial. This leads to the insight 
that new capability “fleet management” was critical. Another new capability was 
“handling weapons”, even though this capability is rather unique for this single case. 
Added to the new capabilities, program management, key-accounting, front-end tech-
nicians gained an increased importance.  
In the framework it is also emphasized that the dynamic capability service devel-
opment is often less front-loaded than in product development and that it is common 
that lead users are deeply involved in the development with customized offerings as 
result. The latter has been verified also in this case. However, in Case C, the first TSS 
on a military product platform, “back-loaded” process is not completely true. Very 
much time and money was spent in the early phases. One reason for this was that both 
the customer and the provider (Case A and B excluded due to organizational reasons) 
had no previous experience from similar businesses. In addition, parts of the customer 
organization were skeptical. Further, there were great difficulties regarding access to 
and agreement on data.  
According to Dosi et al. [29] capabilities are built by building blocks, for example 
routines. In the case some new process was formalized, but it was emphasized that 
creating one “overall” process would not be possible. Still, the latter is yet to be 
proved or falsified. However, civilian, military, airplane and helicopter regulations 
were managed as modules complementing handbooks. 
In the framework also several service engineering models, including different 
components e.g. processes, resources, outcome, material, and dependencies are dis-
cussed. In the case the provider kept it simple. The service champions managed the  
 
 

418

businesses basically via a WBS and connected result/objective, resources/organization 
and costs to each cell. Miller et al. [5] reports on top managers in other companies 
that have a committee focusing on learning between the different businesses. In this 
case the service champions had that role.  
According to the framework successful solutions are often possible to tailor and at 
the same time possible to reuse. The WBS enables customization and at the same time 
it gives a structure. Further the different scenarios from the customization are possible 
to simulate in a simulation tool.

Conclusions 
The study describes how a structured approach of development, implementation and 
operation of TSS can contribute to customization and flexibility on the one hand and 
standardization and synergies on the other hand.  
The basic shape of the organization might change in the beginning of a journey 
towards total service solutions. At first, independent customer-centric units seems to 
be useful to enable full attention to the TSS. When the TSS is operating to its full 
potential (scaling excluded) the directors seems to abandon that strategy.  
The capability fleet management and also balancing customer needs (uptime) 
against maintenance costs are crucial to enable profitable TSS in the studied sector 
and probably also in other similar sectors. Other important capabilities identified in 
the sector are front-end technicians, key-accounting and program management. 
Service development is one important dynamic capability. Former literature indi-
cates that new service development is less front-loaded than new product develop-
ment. This case shows that in TSS development for complex product platforms this is 
not necessary true. When neither the provider or the customer has previous expe-
riences of TSS, the early phases of the development might need as long as five years 
and carry several and complicated investigations. During this journey, the provider 
proved truly dynamic changing strategy from IB to an Extended IB, when the more 
complex and modern product platform was not realistic to grasp as TSS.   
New formalized processes and routines might be necessary to enable extended ser-
vice solutions. In the case it was realized that different modules can be used as  
options in the operation routines if the provider is governed by different external regu-
lations in the different businesses.  
Structured solutions can be accomplished by means of a rather uncomplicated 
WBS with statement of work, organization and costs connected to each cell. This 
structure seems to be useful throughout the complete life cycle of the service and 
enables simulation of different scenarios. Such a structure also enables customization 
and is by definition a dynamic structure. On the same time it is a structure standardiz-
ing the solution.

Abstract. Numerous companies are recently pushed to move from Products to 
Product-Service Systems (PSS). The final aim is to increase the value perceived 
by the market and provide a more flexible and personalized offer by a wide range 
of services connected with the product use. The research question is: how to 
understand the performance of new service-based solutions and easily compare to 
traditional products? Sustainability is nowadays accepted as a guiding principle 
for both public and corporate strategies. Whereas product sustainability can be 
validly estimated by several tools, no certified methods have been defined for PSS 
sustainability estimation yet. This paper proposes the combination of LifeCycle 
Assessment (LCA) and LifeCycle Costing (LCC) techniques to the whole 
lifecycle phases for both Product and PSS. Data comparison can be usefully 
adopted to drive the change towards PSS in industry. An industrial case study 
focusing on washing machines is presented as a valid example of method 
application to support decision-making in the B2C industry. 
Keywords: sustainability, lifecycle design, LCA, LCC, industrial product, PSS.

Introduction 
Recently, numerous manufacturing companies are moving from a product-center to a 
product-service perspective, towards the new concept of Product-Service Systems 
(PSS) [1]. This trend mainly consists of adding a wide range of services to 
differentiate the product and increase the value perceived by the customers. 
Furthermore, diversification of services is rather easy and fast to realize and relatively 
inexpensive as it is no longer based on product feature innovation but on providing 
innovative and temporary product-related services. Companies can add a full service 
portfolio to their products or even sell only the supporting services. In this context, 
companies are required to change their mind and start thinking in a new way. How 
can the performance offered by a PSS be validly estimated, quantified and optimized? 
Conventional tools used to assess traditional products are challenged.  
Whereas products can be validly estimated by lifecycle design assessment 
methods, no structured and certified method has been defined for service estimation 
yet. At the same time, both the industry and the market need for easy-to-use and 
reliable tools to compare scenarios and guide their choices.

The present paper aims to investigate how the lifecycle design approach can be 
adopted to estimate the sustainability of PSS and compare performances of product 
and service. The proposed method considers the whole lifecycle and finally measures 
the achieved performance in terms of environmental and economic impacts, which are 
estimated by lifecycle parameters and normalized to find a global performance indicator 
to objectively compare different solutions. A new indicator SI (Sustainability Indicator) 
is defined to weight and combine the different contributions. It allows having a 
homogeneous unit of measurement (monetary value) by overcoming the existing eco-
efficiency indicators, whose impacts are expressed by dissimilar and not-comparable 
units. 
The experimental study refers to the B2C industry, in particular the household 
appliance sector, and focuses on washing machines. The case study aims to assess the 
sustainability of traditional product and new PSS scenarios to compare them in an 
objective way. The former analysis focuses on the traditional washing machine use, 
the latter investigates an innovative business idea consisting of buying the effective 
washing cycles as a service.

Research Background 
2.1 
From Product to Product-Service Systems 
One of the distinctive characteristics of modern B2C industry is the customer 
attention to solutions and intangible values (such as fun, success, fame, vanity etc.) 
instead of to tangible products. This fact pushes companies to move from product to 
Product-Service Systems (PSS). PSS offers some advantages from manufacturers: 
low-cost and quick diversification, a wider choice of market offer, a shorter time-to-
market [2]. PSS starts from the idea of extended product [3], as a mean of adding 
value by incorporating services into a core product. The core product is the physical 
item traditionally offered on the market. All around the product, a product shell 
representing a set of supporting services as intangible additions can be added. It 
facilitates or supports the product use (e.g. maintenance plans or mobility guarantees). 
Products and services can be combined in a system to deliver required user 
functionality in a way that reduces the impact on the environment as defined by 
Baines et al. [4]. All variants are also linked to the sustainability potential of the 
system. Differentiating the services offered allows the extended product to be 
positioned differently on the market (e.g. coding of personalized functionalities). As a 
consequence, continuous innovation in services assumes a key competitive advantage 
(e.g. a car and the associated financial, maintenance and configuration services etc.).  
Two scenarios can be realized depending on the position of the producer company: 
Product+Service and Product2Service. Product+Service scenario describes the 
simultaneous offering of the tangible product (core product + shell) extended with 
proper tailored services, where both physical product and services contribute to the 
company revenues and their relation needs to be adaptively determined. 
Product2Service scenario is sharply decoupling the manufacturing of goods and

selling of services, where in most cases the physical goods remain property of the 
manufacturer and are considered as an investment, while revenues only come from 
the services (e.g. by selling “mobility” instead of the physical car). The first approach 
sees services as a means of creating a competitive advantage by adding value in the 
customer’s view and making products more difficult to imitate, creating a “win-win 
situation” [5]. The second one sees services as potentially replacing products and is 
concerned with environmental and financial motivation.  
In this contest, evaluating what the real differences for industrial practice and 
which business model is more advantageous assumes a crucial importance for 
companies. It can be achieved by defining objective indicators able to compare the 
sustainability of different scenarios and support strategic decision-making. 
2.2 
Sustainability Assessment Approaches 
Sustainability is nowadays accepted by all stakeholders as a guiding principle for both 
public policy making and corporate strategies and highly competitive solutions. Over 
these decades, the definition of sustainability concept evolved. Actually, the core of 
mainstream sustainability thinking has three dimensions: environment, economy, and 
social wellbeing [6]. However, the biggest challenge for most organizations remains 
in real and substantial implementation of the sustainability concept. The 
implementation challenge is based on understanding how sustainability performance 
can be measured, especially for products and processes [7]. Sustainability assessment 
considering both the cost and environmental impact of new technologies at the early 
stage of development process is a crucial aspect to drive strategic decision-making 
and optimize product and service design as demonstrated also by recent studies [8].  
In this context, lifecycle approach can offer a structured methodology to proceed. It 
basically consists of designing and modelling the product lifecycle through choices 
about product conception, structure and materials in the early design phase. It 
includes the application of technological and scientific principles with the goal of 
protecting the environment and conserving resources, encouraging economic 
progress, keeping in mind the need for sustainability, and optimizing the product 
lifecycle [9]. Lifecycle thinking considers the whole product system lifecycle “from 
cradle to grave”. It also suggests that development phases are influenced by the 
requirements from any lifecycle phases [10]. As a consequence, all relevant phases 
are designed, specified, analysed and made available for simulation purposes, and a 
proper set of key parameters including functional performance, manufacturability, 
serviceability, and environmental impact, can be defined. These lifecycle parameters 
are used as metrics to assess the lifecycle performance (such as environmental, 
economic and social) and to compare and analyse alternative solutions. 
Numerous assessment methods for environmental and sustainability analysis have 
been proposed for single product, from basic theoretical approaches to specific 
methods such as Carbon or Water Foot printing [11]. More recently, simulation 
methods and tools have been also used for PSS analysis because of their growing 
importance for companies [12]: from the estimation of cost of both product and 
integrated solutions [13], to LCS (LifeCycle Simulation) tool for representing the 

424 
M. Peruzzini and M. Germani 
 
whole Product-Service model [14]. Approaches can vary from modularization-
focused, stochastic behaviour-focused, and lifecycle-focused. Garetti [14] provides a 
deep analysis of the state of art. However, some of them are very theoretical and focus 
on the definition of an academic simulation model that is hard to implement in 
practice, while other studies focus on the analysis of specific PSS cases and 
comparison with the corresponding Product solution is not provided.  
It has been demonstrated that creating synergies between LifeCycle Assessment 
(LCA) and LifeCycle Costing (LCC) analysis can assure the achievement of 
sustainable and eco-efficiency solutions [15]. LCA is a decision support tool to 
quantify the environmental impact effects of goods (products or services). LCA takes 
a holistic approach and therefore presents an accurate picture of the environmental 
trade-offs of engineered products, services or human activities. It is based on a set of 
indicators and methods to identify resource consumption and emissions at every stage 
of the product’s lifecycle “from cradle to grave”. It starts from the extraction of raw 
materials to energy production, resource consumption during the use, reuse and final 
disposal of a product [16]. LCA is usually intended for comparison and not absolute 
evaluation, thereby helping decision makers to compare all major environmental 
impacts in the choice of alternative courses of action [17]. LCC can be defined as the 
total cost associated to one activity performed over one fixed time horizon. It 
considers not only the market value of product, but also rather a global vision of cost, 
spread over the whole product lifetime. LCC can be consistent with the LCA 
approach as described above [18]. In literature some coupled LCA and LCC analysis 
have been successfully performed, but in all cases they refer to products [7, 8, 19]. 
Some LCA results refer also to social aspects. Normalizing them into Quality 
Adjusted Life Years is possible to measure the social impacts in terms of a reduction 
of well being as proposed by Weidema [20]. 
3 
Method to Estimate Sustainability of Product and PSS 
The proposed method is based on the achievement of a sustainable solution by 
considering both environmental and economical aspects by coupling LCA and LCC 
analysis. It adopts a lifecycle modelling approach to represent both Product and PSS 
and finally determines a unique index (Sustainability Indicator, SI) to assess the 
quality of each analysed solution. LCA is based on modelling the specific case 
(product or service) and considering the environmental and social impacts according 
to the standardized methods. LCC is based on the same model and considers all the 
related economical aspects, including management costs, usage costs, maintenance 
costs, and recycling costs. Analyses are carried out during the design stage, when 
their combination allows achieving a wider perspective and validly supporting top 
managers’ decisions. The final aim is comparing alternative scenarios, evaluating the 
consumed resources and choosing the less-impact solution [8]. 
The method overview is presented in Figure 1. The method steps are the following: 
1. Apply a lifecycle modelling approach to the specific case and carry out a detailed 
functional analysis to asses the lifecycle stages and the systems / subsystems 
involved. The lifecycle functional model is organized into three main phases: 

 
Investigating the Sustainability of Product and PSS in the B2C Industry 
425 
 
• 
Manufacturing: all manufacturing processes to realize the global system 
components and assemblies. It generally adopts the company viewpoint; 
• 
Use: all contributions related to the Product or PSS use. It generally adopts 
the user viewpoint; 
• 
End-of-Life: all data related to the Product or PSS recycling, disposal and 
eventually re-use. It adopts both the company and user viewpoints; 
2. Define the use scenarios, in terms of user behaviours and lifetimes, to be 
investigated; 
3. Develop a LCA that is fully consistent with the analysed model and covers all the 
lifecycle stages to assess its environmental and social impact; 
4. Develop a LCC that is fully consistent with the analysed model as well to assess 
lifecycle costs; 
5. Normalize the LCA results by estimating the corresponding costs to obtain a 
monetary value for each use scenario. It allows to monetize both environmental 
and social impacts; 
6. Couple normalized LCA and LCC results to obtain a unique evaluation index SI 
(Sustainability Indicator) for each analysed scenario. 
 
Fig. 1. Overview of integrated LCA - LCC method for sustainability assessment 
The proposed approach can be easily applied to different manufacturing contexts 
of use. Indeed, both products and services are modeled and analyzed through their 
main phases and all necessary data can be quickly inferred from BOM (Bill Of 
Material), production documents, use data and disposal practices. As a consequence, 
for the majority of manufacturing products such an investigation can be 
straightforwardly carried out.

3.1 
LCA Indicators 
In order to simulate the whole lifecycle environmental impact, all significant data 
referring to raw materials extraction, processing, assembling and transportation as 
well as the use phase data and the end-of-life information need to be collected 
according to the functional model of the specific case. Analysis follows the four main 
stages suggested by [16]. Such an approach allows to compare different alternative 
cases or design solutions by considering the global impact of the three identified 
phase (Manufacturing, Use, End-of-life) [21]. LCA data need to be multiplied for a 
set of proper weights in order to have significant results. The Eco-Indicator99 (EI-99) 
methodology is adopted [22]. It considers the impact of each material or process 
according to three categories: Human Health, Ecosystem Quality, and Resources. The 
EI-99 unit of measurement is point (Pt). 
3.2 
LCC Indicators 
LCC analysis aims to assess and compare costs associated to the whole lifecycle by 
considering the same functional model adopted for LCA. Data can be deduced by 
preliminary data collection, but usually requires the involvement of managers and 
stakeholders to describe on detail each analysed solution [23]. It determines a unique 
analysis framework, which can guarantee the coupling of the LCA and LCC results. A 
standardized methodology for LCC has not been defined yet and in literature many 
different viewpoints are adopted (supplier, manufacturer, user, society) [24]. While 
Net Present Value (NPV) is typically used as a decision making tool for business 
decisions, LCC takes into account a wide range of technical data which can occur 
during the whole product lifecycle (e.g. energy or fuel consumption in use, 
maintenance operations, end-of-life costs), to provide a more technical analysis [25]. 
The final aim is to highlight the economic impact along the lifecycle by considering a 
certain lifetime. As a consequence, a proper calculation method needs to be used. In 
this paper, the Equivalent Annual Cash Flow technique (EA) is adopted. It allows 
transforming a generic cash flow distribution into an equivalent annual distribution 
with the same actual value by cost actualization. For cost estimation, the formula (1) 
is adopted: 
 
 
 
ܧܣൌܲሺ݅൅1ሻ݊כ݅
ሺ݅൅1ሻ݊െ1

where n is the lifetime years’ number, i is the generic discount rate (for example i = 
3%), and P is the value during the all lifetime. The values refer to the three analysed 
phases as well as for LCA investigation (Manufacturing, Using and End-of-Life).  
3.3 
Sustainability Indicator 
In order to combine LCA and LCC analysis, a Sustainability Indicator (SI) is defined. 
It provides a monetary index representing both the environmental, social and 
economical impacts for the whole lifecycle and the considered lifetime. It considers

427 
 
the values obtained by LCA EI-99 according to the impact categories (Carcinogens, 
Respiratory organics, etc.) [16] that are originally expressed by their own units of 
measurement (DALYs, PDF*m2yr and MJ surplus). Values can be calculated by a 
LCA software tools (i.e. SimaPro). Monetization can be done into 3 steps. 
Step 1. Data are translated into different units by separately expressing the impact on 
human health (in QALYs, Quality Adjusted Life Years), ecosystems (in BAHYs, 
Biodiversity Adjusted Hectare Years) and on resource productivity (in EUROs). 
Expressing the impacts in QALYs also allows to explicit the social impact of a certain 
lifecycle [20]. The unit conversion is realized by the following formulas:

Step 2. QALYs and BAHYs are translated in EUROs by using budget constraints, 
according to [26]. For QALYs the budget constraint can be determined as the 
potential annual economic production per capita at full well-being, that is estimated as 
74,000 €. For BAHYs, they can be translated in QALYs by comparing the global 
terrestrial species-area (13×109 ha years) to the global human population (6,2×109 
people). The ratio is 21. MJ can be translated into EUROs by considering the lifetime.

These formulas are based on European average data for having a consistent 
redefinition.  
Step 3. After monetization, LCA contributions can be translated into the 
corresponding costs and they can be added to LCC data expressing the economic 
impact to finally obtain the global SI. Such a method can be repeated for each 
analysed system or scenario (Product or PSS) to compare different solutions.

Industrial Test Case: PSS in Washing Machine Market  
The proposed case study has been developed in collaboration with Indesit Company 
and investigates an innovative idea in a very traditional B2C sector, household 
appliances. In particular it focuses on washing machines and aims to compare the 
sustainability of traditional Product (Washing Machine, WM) and two PSS solutions 
(both Product2Service) based on selling washing cycles as a service. The proposed 

428 
M. Peruzzini and M. Germani 
 
lifecycle assessment method is applied for the case study analysis and modelling, and 
performance indicators (LCA, LCC and finally SI) are determined for the three cases.   
4.1 
Product and PSS Case Studies 
The Product case study consists of the traditional sell and use of a washing machine 
(Hotpoint Aqualtis AQ131D-69EU, 11kg). The tangible good (WM) is sold as an 
assembly of numerous components and it washes clothes by consuming clean water, 
electric energy and detergents (provided by the user and home infrastructure). The 
business model is traditional as well: the consumer pays the product at the beginning 
and than pays for the resources consumed.  
The PSS case studies refer to selling Product2Service solutions, when the customer 
pays only for the service whereas the WM is given for free. In both cases, the user 
pays only a “payXuse” fee and a special rate for the consumed resources (water, 
energy and detergents), which is fixed in collaboration with the energy supplier. 
The first case (PSS-1) considers a direct payXuse service and the consumption rate 
is paid for every washing cycle done (0,45 €/cycles). The second case (PSS-2) 
considers a weekly payXuse subscription and a fixed fee is paid weekly regardless of 
the number of effective cycles (2 €/week). The product is similar to the Product one, 
but it is enhanced with some additional components able to connect the WM to the 
home gateway and Internet network and to allow the remote monitoring of WM 
behaviour. 
4.2 
Use Case Scenarios 
For both Product and PSS cases, three scenarios are investigated. They consider three 
different user profiles, which are representative of the European habits. They derive 
from a marketing analysis conducted by the company marketing referring to washing 
care: for each profile, a characterization and an average weekly number of cycles are 
defined: 
• 
House Manager (HM), who is an expert user, generally a woman, housewife or 
retired, taking care to house management and family issues in a special way (4,3 
cycles/week with optimized loading); 
• 
Efficiency Seeker (ES), who is generally a man with an active social life and an 
efficient, fast and pragmatic house management (5,8 cycles/week with low 
loading); 
• 
Delegator (D), who is a young user, girl or boy, paying a limited attention to the 
house care in general and has an intense workload (3,9 cycles/week with 
medium/high loading).  
Three lifetime scenarios are considered (1 year, 6 years and 10 years) for both Product 
and PSS.

4.3 
Analysis of Product Sustainability 
The product BOM (Bill of Materials) and the product structure are the starting point 
to carry out the lifecycle analysis and obtain the product functional model. Then, LCA 
analysis considers the lifecycle model and organizes all data into three phases: 
Manufacturing, Use, and End-of-Life. 
The Manufacturing phase considers all the components used for the production 
and the final assembly, and all information related to manufacturing processes of 
BOM components as well as part and material transports. LCA data are organized 
according to the main functional entities: oscillating group, balancing and 
suspensions, electrical components, hydraulics, aesthetics, cabinet. Due to the high 
numbers of components, a 5% cut-off is applied to not consider those parts that have a 
limited impact. LCC analysis starts from the same functional model and calculates the 
manufacturing costs as directly considered by the manufacturer (Indesit Company). 
The Use phase considers the user profile (HM, ES, D) and the lifetime (1, 6 or 10 
years). LCA data relate to the consumed resources and materials: electric energy 
consumption, water consumption, detergent consumption, softener consumption, 
spare parts (e.g. hydraulic pump, electrical resistance, door seal, elastic belt, pressure 
valve, drain pipe group). Spare parts are inferred from statistical analysis of assistance 
service. Furthermore, a realistically decrease of performance corresponding to 
efficiency losses is estimated, as suggested by real data. Performance decrease is 
expressed by a cut percentage according to the number of the executed cycles (5% 
reduction after 500 cycles, 10% reduction after 1000 cycles, 20% reduction over 2000 
cycles). LCC considers the product cost and all costs generated by the resource 
consumptions during the use: electric energy (0,2 €/kWh), water (0,0011 €/lt), 
detergents (2,5 €/lt), softener (1,4 €/lt) and calcium remover (0,33 €/cycle). Quantities 
are estimated by statistical analyses on real users over 5 years monitoring in field tests. 
In the End-of-Life phase, LCA follows European Directive on Electric Equipment 
Waste (WEEE) for managing the product components: recycling (55%), reuse (10%) 
and landfill (35 %). Such data are considered on the effective percentage of sold 
machines that are actually recycled (about 25% of total). LCC takes into account the 
disposal cost paid by the producer to a third company who is responsible for the 
product treatment. In LCC analysis, all data are actualized by adopting EA method 
according to the lifetime and then summed. 
4.4 
Analysis of PSS Sustainability 
About the PSS cases, the lifecycle functional model is organized into the same three 
phases, with some differences: 
• 
New components in product structure to create the PSS infrastructure, support the 
additional functionalities providing services and allow the service system 
management (e.g. the presence of a smart plug, Zigbee module, a more advanced 
main board, a wiring network, 24/7 call-center assistance, data storage system, 
etc.); 

430 
M. Peruzzini and M. Germani 
 
• 
Higher performances due to a continuous control of the machine status and real-
time monitoring and assistance (i.e. PSS machine is monitored and parts can be 
substituted in advance to guarantee a high quality performance for the whole 
lifetime); 
• 
Optimized End-of-Life scenario, because the manufacturer directly manages the 
disposal (i.e. the machine is a company property also after sale and the company 
will care about it). 
In the Manufacturing phase, LCA is carried out similarly to the product one, taking 
into account the new components, which. Also LCC analysis is carried out in the 
same way, but PSS production cost differ due to the new system components. A new 
cost item is represented by the “service expence” considering call-center services, the 
personnel employed there and the wiring network. Cost evaluation for service 
management and customer assistance has been assessed by company managers. 
The Use phase considers the user profile (HM, ES, D) and the lifetime (1, 6, and 
10 years) as for product analyses. However, the machine efficiency is higher thanks to 
the network connection and remote monitoring, so that its performances are 
maximum lifelong and LCA are reduced. LCC contemplates a more complex list of 
items: product rent, consumption costs (like in the Product analysis), service 
management cost, service subscription cost. 
The End-of-Life phase shows the main differences. As far as LCA is concerned, 
PSS has a 100% of retired products and consequently a higher percentage of recycled 
materials. Furthermore, the more careful product disposal allows depicting three 
disposal scenarios according to the lifetime in accordance with WM regulations and 
data from Consortia on Recycling and Disposal:  
• 
1-year lifetime: WM is reused after testing and upgrading (99% reuse, 1% 
landfill); 
• 
6-years lifetime: WM is partially reused after testing and upgrading and some 
components can be recycled (75% reuse, 25% recycled, 5% landfill); 
• 
10-years lifetime: WM goes to disposal (100%). 
LCC analysis for PSS is carried out as for the product, but considers also the different 
disposal scenario and cost for the company.

Results and Comparison 
Table 1 shows LCA results for Product and PSS solutions, according to the lifecycle 
phase and the user profile. It provides a quick overview of different cases and 
highlights those with the highest impact. Data are expresses in EI-99 Eco-points. The 
last row contains the normalized impact calculated by adopting the above-mentioned 
formulas (2-7). 
Table 2 shows the LCC analysis results considering PSS-1 and PSS-2, differing 
from the adopted business model (cycle fee or weekly rate). Table 3 contains SI 
values expressing the total impacts for the three analysed scenarios. 10-years lifetime

results are reported: they represent the total impact expressed in euros for each 
solution (Product, PSS-1, PSS-2) and for each user profile. SI evaluation can easily 
support decision-making in B2C industry since it is able to quickly determine the 
global impact of a certain solution in respect with the target market. For example, 
case study results highlight which is the best strategic solution to launch the 
“payXuse” service on three target markets. Considering a 10-years lifecycle, it is 
worth to notice that both PSS solutions are advantageous in respect with traditional, 
independently of the user profile. Indeed, PSS-1 and PSS-2 total impacts are lower for 
all user profiles. Furthermore, it is possible to highlight the best strategy for each 
consumer: for Efficiency Seekers (characterizing by an intensive use) PSS-2 solution 
is preferable (689 € instead of 726 € for PSS-1 and 1.060 for Product), while for 
Delegators PSS-1 is more advantageous (562 € instead of 577€ for PSS-2 and 801 € 
for Product). For House Managers PSS-1 and PSS-2 bring comparable advantages 
(respectively 554 € and 558€).

Varying the considered lifetime, interesting business model analysis can be 
inferred (Fig. 2): for 6-years lifetime the scenario is similar with some slight 
differences, but product remain the most expensive case for all the user profiles. For 
1-year lifetime the situation is changed as SI value considers both the company and 
the customer benefits. It could be surprising but it can be explained considering that 
for such a limited time horizon PSS costs are higher due to depreciation and capital 
costs. 
The proposed method can be adopted by different actors for different purposes: 
engineers can have useful data to better understand the impact of products and PSS; 
top managers can easily calculate a performance indicator to support strategic 
decision-making; marketing experts can compare market solutions; and finally 
customers have a tangible index to support their purchasing decisions.

Conclusions  
The paper proposes a method to assess the sustainability of product and PSS based on 
a coupled LCA and LCC analysis. The experimental study focuses on washing 
machines and investigates the benefits of innovative PSS solutions for both 
manufacturers and customers. Experimentation demonstrated that it is useful to easily 
assess the sustainability of manufacturing products and PSS and compare the 
achieved performances accordingly to the considered lifetime and user profiles, 
simulating alternative business models. The study depicted several scenarios and 
simulated the impact on sustainability on the basis of a unique indicator. Such a 
method can validly support PSS implementation in practice as well as the 
identification of the best business model during the design stage. The proposed 
approach can be adopted by engineers as well as top managers and marketing experts.

Abstract. Design changes performance significantly, as has been proven in the 
case of physical products. Quantitative research on a real offering in a market 
consisting of physical products and services is rarely reported. This paper aims 
to illustrate and discuss how design changes on a physical product or a service 
can improve the environmental and economic performance of an offering. The 
series of offerings compared in this paper are provided by a manufacturing 
company and are currently found in the marketplace. The in-depth study of this 
case shows the substantial contribution of design changes on performance, and 
reveals the high relevance of the interrelation between product and service on 
performance. 
Keywords: LCA (Life Cycle Assessment), LCC (Life Cycle Cost), PSS (Prod-
uct/Service System), IPSE (Integrated Product Service Engineering).

Introduction 
More and more companies have abandoned traditional sales of products or service 
offerings in favour of Integrated Product Service Offering (IPSO), which is a term 
used in this paper to refer to PSS (Product/Service System) [1] with an emphasis on 
the importance of integration. However, they still often base their new offerings on 
their traditional products and services, without making any design changes (see e.g. 
Sakao & Lindahl [2]). Even though several researchers (e.g. [3-5]) have advocated 
that companies need to redesign their physical products in order to make their new 
offerings profitable and environmentally friendly, this is rarely realized. The reasons 
include that their current products and services were developed based on the old busi-
ness logic, where spare parts and maintenance during the active use phase was consi-
dered to be very profitable. In the IPSO business logic, spare parts and maintenance 
are considered as costs and thus detrimental in terms of improving the economic  
performance of the offering. The subject of this paper how a provider’s processes 
(mainly design) influence IPSO performance. 
In general, different processes affect the performance of an IPSO, with the major 
processes being design, production, and use. Note that other processes by a provider 
such as logistics, maintenance, and take-back are modelled here as service within an 

436 
M. Lindahl and T. Sakao 
IPSO. In addition, production and use of service happen simultaneously, i.e. simul-
taneity or ubiquity of service [6], while that of a product occurs sequentially. The 
contribution of design on life cycle performance is perceived to be high. Specifically, 
the earlier stage of design is most influential. From the economic aspect, for instance, 
in the case of products, “the task clarification stage of product design accounts for 
only 10-15% but determines 50-70% of the total cost” is well-known [7, 8]. 
The influences of design, production, and use on economic and environmental as-
pects using real-life cases in industry have been reported, especially in the last decade. 
The influences of design are reported mainly from the automotive sector. For in-
stance, Alonso et al. [9] and Schmidt [10] show the life cycle cost and the life cycle 
environmental impact of different materials and/or designs for a specific part of a car. 
Concerning production, the relationship between manufacturing process precision and 
environmental impact is quantified by extending the LCA methodology, and was 
reported to be positive in the case of an automotive drive train [11]. The use process’ 
influence is also addressed. For instance, Avram et al. [12] proposed a method for 
adopting AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and applying it for sustainability assess-
ment of different alternatives within the use phase, such as cutting parameters, to a 
case on machine tool systems. Fig. 1 depicts the processes and aspects of an IPSO 
system, as well provides some example references for the processes. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Processes influencing an IPSO and major aspects for evaluation 
As briefly reviewed above, existing literature based on real-life cases in industry 
focuses on physical products. One of the few papers reporting the different economic 
and environmental performances, depending on if it is an IPSO or product sales, is 
Sundin et al. [13]. There is clearly a lack of knowledge on how design of an IPSO, 
especially its service component, influences the economic and environmental aspects.

Objective 
The objective of this paper is to, based on an in-depth case study in a manufacturing 
company providing an IPSO, illustrate and discuss how design changes on a physical 
product or a service can improve the environmental and economic performance of an 
offering. In contrast to Sundin et al. [13], this paper addresses a series of design

changes longitudinally in order to better illustrate the design activities of IPSOs in 
industry.  
The paper discusses the contribution of changes on a contract of IPSO business 
based on our earlier investigation, in an integrated manner, with the changes on a 
physical product. The value of this paper lies in its argumentation on the importance 
of design changes on the IPSO context, i.e. those on a physical product and a contract, 
based on real cases in the manufacturing industry.

Method 
Literature studies, interviews and questionnaires were the methods used for gathering 
data about the case. Strong trust between the authors and participating companies, 
built over many years, has enabled unique access to data that are considered to be 
business secrets in many companies. These data have been carefully managed and 
agglomerated so that the final results do not reveal sensitive secrets, yet maintain the 
sufficient sources for scientific argumentation. 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) methodologies have 
been used to illustrate the quantitative changes in environmental and economic per-
formance, the two of which are briefly described below.  
3.1 
Life Cycle Assessment 
LCA is a method used to assess a product’s life cycle’s total environmental impact, 
from an overall perspective, associated with all the stages of its life, from cradle-to-
grave. These stages span from raw material extraction to manufacturing processes and 
use in waste management, including all transport and energy consumption. Life cycle 
analysis can be done in all human activities and products such as food, packaging, 
electronics, fuels, transportation, etc. 
3.2 
Life Cycle Cost 
LCC is a cost model that reflects the total cost of an investment, product or system. 
All costs associated with all the stages of its life, from cradle-to-grave, are summa-
rized, i.e. from raw material extraction, through manufacturing processes and use in 
waste management, including all transport and all energy consumption. It is a method 
used for instance in the analysis of overall costs and comparative studies in procure-
ment, product development and maintenance planning.

The Case – Core Plugs for Paper Mills 
Polyplank AB has developed a process to transform plastic waste and wood fibres 
into a cheap, recyclable and moisture-resistant composite material used in different 
system solutions, one of which is the core plugs used by paper mills [13, 14]. Paper 
mills use core plugs, on which the paper is rolled up; thus, the core plugs follow the 

438 
M. Lindahl and T. Sakao 
roll out to the customer. Below is a description of how Polyplank’s core plug IPSO 
concept has been developed over time, and how the development has influenced - and 
has been influenced by - the core plug design. 
4.1 
Background 
Polyplank’s core plugs have, in several cases, come to replace previously used core 
plugs that were made of a formaldehyde material. Fig. 2 shows an example of how 
they can look. Formaldehyde-based glues are used extensively in the woodworking 
industries, e.g. in the glues that bond particle board together. Formaldehyde core 
plugs are normally made of moulded wood chips that are glued together with formal-
dehyde-based glues. Core plugs made of formaldehyde material have several draw-
backs that caused both paper mills and their customers various problems.  
 
 
Fig. 2. A traditional core plug made of formaldehyde material 
One problem was that they often gave rise to splinters that destroyed the paper so 
that it could not be used. This caused a financial loss for the paper mill and especially 
their customers. Furthermore, since these plugs were designed for single use, it caused 
the paper mill's customers extra work and costs for waste disposal. All this implied 
that the paper mill was interested in finding a new, more suitable plug that could solve 
the problems above. 
4.2 
The Orginal Polyplank Core Plug Design 
By coincidence, Polyplank obtained information about the paper mill’s need. The 
paper mill company had already started to consider a core plug made of virgin plastic, 
and had also come up with a design for the plugs. Together with a competitor that 
made core plugs based on virgin plastics, Polyplank started to deliver and sell core 
plugs in a traditional way, i.e. for single use, as shown in Fig. 3.  
From a traditional sales perspective, the core plugs were nearly perfect. As a sin-
gle-use designed product predefined by the customer, it required a lot of material and 

 
Environmental and Economic Contribution of Design Changes in IPSO 
439 
was dependent on the geometry, which was complicated to produce. Sharp edges and 
corners implied extra requirements on the tool for the injection moulding, and also for 
the time in the tool. At the same time, the production complexity implied that the 
company could charge a premium for the production. Furthermore, the selected geo-
metry also implied a relatively high weight, which also meant high use of Polyplank’s 
material. This was also good from a traditional sales perspective, especially since the 
company could refer to the initial customer’s specification. The paper mill’s custom-
er, however, still had difficulty disposing of the used core plugs.

4.3 
The Take-Back System of Destroyed Core Plugs – The Starting of an 
IPSO 
One of the major benefits of Polyplank’s self-developed material is that it is easy to 
reuse in new core plugs or other Polyplank offerings. This also implied that Polyplank 
had an idea from their beginning to be able to take back and reuse the material in their 
old products. This goal has also had an impact on how they have designed their prod-
ucts or systems; in other words, it should be easy to take back the Polyplank material. 
It was, therefore, not unusual when Polyplank proposed to their customers that they 
could start to take back their core plugs and as well as those made of virgin plastic. 
Those made of virgin plastic became a raw material when producing the Polyplank 
material.  
The paper mill agreed and used reverse logistics to handle the take-back, some-
thing that became immediately successful. The paper mill and their customers had 
less costs for waste. From Polyplank’s perspective, this was of course a win as stated 
above, since after a chopping process it could reuse incoming scrapped core plugs as 
direct raw material for new ones.  
4.4 
The Reuse System for Core Plugs  
Those within Polyplank continued to think of how they could improve their offerings. 
They realized that a lot of the core plugs that came back were like new and could be 

440 
M. Lindahl and T. Sakao 
reused by the paper mill company. However, in order to secure the quality, they had 
to be inspected and washed. Only the worn-out or destroyed core plugs should be sent 
back for material recycling. Therefore, they proposed to the paper mill that they 
should launch a take-back and refurbishment system within their own operations, i.e. 
reuse of core plugs from their customers. From a traditional business perspective, this 
made no sense for Polyplank, but the company had a longer and broader perspective. 
The paper mill set up a take-back system, including cleaning, as seen in Fig. 4, and 
from the beginning this was a success for both their customers and themselves.  
 
 
Fig. 4. Cleaning of used core plugs at the paper mill company 
At the same time, it started to become obvious that the core plugs’ original geome-
try with sharp edges and corners, often the starting points for cracks (see Fig. 5), had 
several cons. Even though broken new core plugs didn’t cause major damage to the 
paper, e.g. that caused by splinters, they still resulted in an economic loss since the 
core plugs could not be reused, but instead had to be sent back for material reuse. 
After introducing the tack-back system, it also became obvious that the complex 
geometry also made it tricky for the paper mill to clean the plugs before reuse. This, 
however, this was not a cost that affected Polyplank.

4.5 
The New Polyplank Core Plug Design 
Even though Polyplank creates their products and IPSOs based on recycled material, 
they prefer to use as little material as possible in their offerings. Cutting down the 
material use has been a core value for Polyplank since the beginning; they want to 
develop, from a life cycle perspective, resource-efficient and effective products. 
In line with this, internally Polyplank also had thoughts of how they could modify 
the original core plug design into a design that not only solved the above described 
cons with the existing core design, but also reduced their cost for providing the  
offering. 
Even though they could reuse their material, their idea was to develop a core plug 
that required less material, was easier to produce, was easier to transport and clean 
and, not least, more durable. The latter was important in order to make the plug more 
competitive, and also allow more reuse between the paper mill and their customers. 
The key was to use less material in the product. By using less material in each core 
plug, less material had to be chopped and processed in Polypank’s factory, i.e. heated 
up etc. in the moulding machine and transported to the customer. In addition, the pa-
per mill’s transportation costs could be reduced. 
Together with the paper mill they started up a redesign project in order to design a 
more system-optimal core plug. In collaboration with a consultancy company and a 
university, they began to re-design the current core plug. The company performed 
advanced Finite Element Method analysis to find a design that could improve the core 
plugs’ durability while also making the core plugs easier to wash, produce and trans-
port. The result was a core plug that was 35% more durable, and at the same time 
30% lighter, as shown in Fig. 6. The higher durability implied more loops between the 
paper mill and their customers, and the reduced weight meant less transportation and 
production costs, since less material needs to be managed in the production process, 
for example in the injection moulding used for producing the core plug.

The core plug IPSO is now more than 10 years old, and has resulted in Polyplank 
taking market shares from competitors as well as a close collaboration between  
Polyplank and the paper mill company. Normally, the core plugs go back and forth 
several times between the paper mill and their customers before the plugs return to 
Polyplank.

Changes in Environmental and Economic Performance 
As described above, the core plug and the system in which it is used has been changed 
several times over the years; the question is the effect this has had on the offering’s 
environmental and economic performance. In order to investigate and illustrate this, 
LCA and LCC analysis have been used. All calculations are based on data provided 
by Polyplank.  
Based on how the core plug and its system have changed over time, nine different 
alternatives have been calculated to illustrate the performance effect of the changes. 
Table 1 presents the different alternatives.

Discussed below are some of the most important effects of changes performed. 
Note that all of the results below are related to the entire life cycle. Also important to 
note is that the compared LCA result only relates to global warming (CO2 eqv); other 
environmental categories, such as savings regarding natural resource etc., are not 
included. 
5.1 
Effects of the Introduction of Polyplank’s Core Plugs 
Since it is not possible to make a comparison with core plugs made of formaldehyde, 
the starting point and reference used is core plugs made of virgin plastics that are used 
one time before being scrapped.  
Not surprisingly, the introduction of the Polyplank core plug resulted in a substan-
tial environmental performance improvement, 31% for the old design and 57% for the 
new design. This was the case despite that they would be sold in a traditional way and 

 
Environmental and Economic Contribution of Design Changes in IPSO 
443 
only used one time before being scrapped. The economic performance improvement 
was even higher at 36% and 62%, respectively. 
5.2 
Effects of the Take-Back System of Destroyed Core Plugs 
When comparing the effect of the take-back system of destroyed core plugs with the 
single-use system of core plugs made of Polyplank material, the relative environmen-
tal / economic improvement effect is high, 57% vs. 51%. When comparing the im-
provement between the old core plug design used once and the new core plug (reused 
for material 5 times), the effect is 70% vs. 66%. 
5.3 
Effects of the Reuse System for Core Plugs 
Compared with the newly-designed core plugs, used only once, core plugs used five 
times have a significantly improved environmental and economic effect, approximate-
ly 71% and 73%, respectively. If the core plug could be reused even more times, this 
would further increase the improvement effect. However, the percentage improve-
ment effect decreases for each time the product can be reused, since the relative cost 
for reuse in comparison with the production cost increases. 
5.4 
The Total Effect of the Polyplank Core Plug Offering 
Fig. 7 shows the environmental and economic improvement effect of Polyplank’s 
Core Plug Offering in comparison with different alternatives. In the figure below, the 
most interesting is Alternative 9, since it is most like the offering that Polyplank pro-
vides. The exact number of reuse and material recycling instances, however, differs 
slightly from the real case.  
Nevertheless, in comparison to the original core plugs sold for single use, their of-
fering’s environmental and economic performances have improved, 9% vs. 13%. If 
compared with the core plug made of virgin plastic, the figures are 6% and 8%, re-
spectively. At the same time, the offering’s performance also improved, something 
which was not anticipated. 
6 
Discussion 
As shown in the previous section, all of the design changes on either the product or 
the service (such as product reuse and material recycling) in the case were found to 
improve the environmental and economic performance compared with Alternatives 1 
or 2. Note that Alternative 2 represents the traditional product sales business with the 
original design at the IPSO provider. This means that this provider could design a 
product or a service that contributes to both the economy and the environment: i.e., 
Alternative 3 (new design of product) or Alternative 8 (new design of service) as a 
reference to Alternative 2. However, it is important to note that Alternative 3 and 
Alternative 8 are both unrealistic. Considering each service, Alternative 3 has exces-
sive quality regarding the product, while Alternative 8 may have insufficient quality 

444 
M. Lindahl and T. Sakao 
regarding the product. On the other hand, Alternative 9 (new design of both product 
and service) makes sense because the implemented product quality is required by the 
provided service. In fact, the new product design was carried out based on the service 
(as shown in Section 4.5). This case shows how design of service and design of prod-
uct influence each other on a real offering in industry, and serves as evidence of the 
need for the integrated design of product and service.

Fig. 7. Relative comparison of the environmental and economic effect of different alternatives 
The degrees of contribution by design changes on performance given different al-
ternatives were found to be up to approximately a factor of 10 (with Alternative 1 as a 
reference) in this case. This case did not show the contribution of production and use 
of this IPSO on performance. Such quantitative comparison between the contribution 
by design, production, and use would be an interesting topic for future work.  
Correlation between environmental and economic improvement was found to be 
positive in most of the comparisons of different alternatives in this case. Although this 
cannot be generalized, earlier research [13] also shows that some other cases have a

similar trend. It would be interesting to identify the key factors influencing this trend, 
and this will be part of our future research.  
Another interesting research avenue is determining the factors that enabled Polyp-
lank to design this series of IPSOs. Apparently, successes in designing IPSOs with 
better performance on the environment and the economy like Polyplank are not so 
common. One can ask what kinds of factors are keys to this success – product charac-
teristics, company characteristics, or something else.  
Unfortunately, since it has not been possible to obtain any data for the formalde-
hyde core plug, this is not included in the comparison. It would have been interesting 
to calculate the environmental and economic performance change related to the losses 
of paper and extra work at the customer caused by the formaldehyde core plugs.

Conclusion 
This paper presented one of the first in-depth and quantitative studies of an IPSO’s 
effects on the environment and the economy. It focused on design changes rather than 
changes of production or use. The case showed substantial improvement (reduction of 
approximately 80 to 90% in terms of both LCA and LCC) by the provider’s design 
changes of a product or a service on environmental and the economic performance. 
Most importantly, the high relevance of the interrelation between the product and the 
service on the performance was shown.  
This case can be used as a reference to illustrate the effects of design changes of 
IPSOs on the environment and the economy, as well as to argue for the importance of 
the integration of product and service design. It should be mentioned that this is 
thanks to the in-depth study. In addition, the relatively simple structure of the physical 
product can be argued to support the ease of understanding the comparison among 
different alternatives. Our future work includes conducting similar case studies with 
different types of offerings to obtain more insight within this area, and investigating 
key factors for success such as in the presented case.

Knowledge Sharing in Product Development – 
Delimitations of a White Paper Approach

Abstract. There is an on-going movement in manufacturing industry towards 
Product-Service Systems (PSS), which manifests the importance of making ex-
perience based knowledge organizationally available. In this paper a study of 
how white books is used and discussing any delimitations in transferring expe-
riences is in focus. The paper builds on an empirical study in a manufacturing 
company, which has long ago implemented the white book approach and also 
has the vision of PSS development. It has been found that the format of a white 
book and the guidelines for authoring them could be a barrier for expressing in-
dividually gained experiences. Subsequently, does not support a knowledge 
transfer between projects having different aims, perspectives and knowledge 
domains.  
Keywords: Product-Service Systems, knowledge transfer, knowledge sharing, 
expertise sharing, innovation projects, white books.

Introduction 
Product-Service Systems (PSS) calls for additional competences of the engineers, for 
example a capability to simultaneously design service solutions, which insists on 
skills to understand fuzzy user situations and needs [e.g., 1]. Fundamentally, the ser-
vice infusion in PSS challenges traditional knowledge transfer due to the different 
logics of product development and service development [2-3]. A similar difference in 
reasoning can be discerned in how engineers manage facts (i.e., measured and verified 
knowing) and experiences (i.e., assessed and sensed knowing) in contemporary engi-
neering projects.  
Development of PSS offerings increases the so-called tacit knowledge, as for  
example experiences, in the process activities. Tacit knowledge is recognized as an 
important element of product development and design work [4], this knowledge is 
described in literature as experiential and action-oriented knowledge hard to codify 
and communicate in writings [5]. The PSS vision stresses the importance of commu-
nicating tacit knowledge and experiences throughout the development process, in 
particular externally gained insights needs to be brought into early stages of concep-
tual design. And, this is from industry representatives described as a grand challenge 
for PSS. This might be the case since the problem is already known, sharing  

448

experiences is as is today a challenge in existing development projects [6]. A common 
approach in industry is the efforts to capture lessons learned and experience based 
knowledge in white papers. A white paper, or a white book in this case, is a written 
report often authored by a project leader. The intentions are to aid understanding of, 
for example an issue, a problem, or guide decisions or a subsequent project. By this, a 
large part of the contents in white papers strive to capture and formalize experiences 
and tacit knowledge. The paradox of experiences as “not being readily expressed” and 
“hard to codify” is recognized by organizations, while in lack of more promising  
approaches the white papers are a good effort.  
Within a framework of PSS as triggering a more effective approach to sharing ex-
periences, the purpose in this paper is to exemplify the delimitations of white papers. 
This is done in order to conclude on implications in general, but also in particular for 
PSS development.

Methodology 
The study presented in this paper is not only theoretical, but also based on interviews 
with industry representatives from a product development company. The company 
has a background of implementation of PSS solutions, and PSS is also part of the 
future vision. The company has assisted in finding representatives involved in a 
knowledge transfer process between two different phases of product development. So 
far, particularly the knowledge transfer between the advanced engineering project and 
the receiver, a new product development project, has been in focus. 
7 representatives from four similar projects have been involved in semi-structured 
interviews. Both employees from the transferring sides and the receiving side of such 
knowledge transfer process have been interviewed based on their previous and current 
experience. Further, a number of 25 white papers have been examined, not only from 
these projects where interviews have been conducted, but also from other related 
projects. 
Longitudinal empirical data is used as a base for this study. Data has been gathered 
when following actions taken in the advanced engineering project for over 2 years.  
During company visits, project meetings and workshops have been attended. Sha-
dowing of employees, i.e., following someone when doing ordinary tasks, has been 
used to gain insights into daily knowledge sharing activities. Interviews with engi-
neers, project leaders and experts have been conducted, transcribed and analyzed. 
Informal discussions with project members and check-ins on project portals has con-
tributed to a general view of the work. So, all in all, besides interviews and scanning 
documents, the projects’ work has been observed at the company, but also by partici-
pation/observation of the activities at digital portal for project work.

Knowledge Management 
Product development is often described as a knowledge intensive work and know-
ledge management approaches are well established in manufacturing industry, e.g., in 

 
Knowledge Sharing in Product Development 
449 
 
Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE), Computer Aided Design (CAD), Product Data 
Management (PDM) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. 
Knowledge management refers to the actions undertaken in order to enhance and 
ensure the organization's knowledge base [7]. As different views on knowledge exist, 
different perceptions exist regarding how to manage knowledge as well. 
In knowledge management literature, the division into two streams is common, 
namely first and second wave of knowledge management. The first wave describes 
gathering, managing and control of existing knowledge [8]. This type of knowledge is 
typically facts, calculations and measures etcetera. This is also the type of knowledge 
a KBE-tool is based on. This kind of knowledge management tools can be described 
as ‘heavyweight’ support [9], since it needs to be maintained and kept up to date by a 
specific organizational role, for instance a software engineer. 
The second wave of knowledge management relates to creation and sharing of 
knowledge, but is also described to have a meaning of providing possibilities to learn 
[8], e.g., from experiences. The second wave type is based on subjective and socially 
constructed experiences; from this perspective knowledge evolves when people, for 
example jointly solve problems. This approach has also been categorized as 
‘lightweight’ [9], due to the low effort to maintain the contents and to find compatible 
software. This approach is not intended to replace the traditional knowledge manage-
ment platforms, rather the aim is to complement with more social and tacit dimen-
sions to deal with problems related to product development [9-10]. 
The differences between the first and the second wave of knowledge management 
have been highlighted by Huysman and de Wit [11] see Table 1.

Referring to the description in Table 1 above, the first wave of knowledge man-
agement is more related to explicit (codified) knowledge, and therefore suitable for 
known situations. While the second wave of knowledge management prescribes a 
more social approach, with which PSS aligns. PSS requires a wider approach and 

450 
J. Holmqvist and Å. Ericson 
 
involvement of more actors in the development stages, e.g., an interdisciplinary ap-
proach to address complex sustainability issues [12].  
How to conduct a knowledge transfer and a experience sharing process differs, 
thus it is important to be aware of such differences. By definition knowledge transfer 
has been explained as a process which; “…occurs when experience in one unit of an 
organization affects another unit” [10] and thereby completes a task.  
Knowledge transfer is applicable when communicating especially codified know-
ledge and facts. Knowledge transfer does not need to involve interaction between 
employees to execute a transfer; rather management systems are well suited to sup-
port this. However, when an engineer gets a new position the experiences possessed 
by that employee will disappear with the person, and become useful to that new divi-
sion instead. Another situation could be when engineers use a computer-based tool for 
simulations, these results will have an effect on several parts of the design work not 
only the task at hand. In such a situation, a receiver of the simulation results might not 
be able to explain what has happened in the previous step, but can still understand 
how to use that information based on own experiences. If so, it is possible to argue 
that information or explicit knowledge is transferred, but not experiences or tacit 
knowledge.  
Knowledge sharing or expertise sharing has been described as the act of making 
experiences available to others within the organization [13]; by this, knowledge shar-
ing is more or less based on an interchange of lessons learned between humans. If so, 
any support requires to aid and ease interaction, dialogue, participation and collabora-
tive work.  
Experiences can be described as a certain category of knowledge that often relates 
to the complexity in relationships and networks of large global product development 
enterprises. Experience is defined as; “…valuable, stored, specific knowledge that 
was acquired by an agent in a previous problem solving situation” [14]. Therefore, 
one can argue that experience implies some useful lessons learned from solving prob-
lems, which is embedded in the person’s know how and know why [15].  
As argued, incorporating experiences into the organizational knowledge base needs 
approaches and methods different from managing information and explicit know-
ledge. Such instruments do not readily exist. In this paper, the white book approach is 
in focus.

White Book 
Documents to capture knowledge used in e.g., the field of business to business, are 
known as white paper or white book, but originates from the area of government. The 
European Union state that; “White papers are documents containing proposals for 
Community action in a specific area… When a white paper is favourably received by 
the Council, it can lead to an action programme for the Union in the area concerned” 
[16]. Yet, a practical and industrial definition is used in the case company for this 
paper. The term white book is defined on the company’s internal wiki-page for  
abbreviations and terminology as;  “A ‘white book’ is a summary of positive and 

 
Knowledge Sharing in Product Development

negative experiences, as well as recommended actions from team members in the 
entire project”. The target group for a white book is members of future projects, or-
dering department, steering committees, process owners or other concerned. The idea 
with white books is to give the receiver a chance to learn from mistakes as well as 
successes of others, to improve development work and run ‘better’ managed projects. 
The white book approach is well established and used in all projects as a delivera-
ble at the end of the project time. The respondents stressed that the white book should 
not be mixed up with a project report, which has the purpose to account for facts 
about final concepts, specifications, economical aspects etc. The objective of a white 
book is to prescribe changes, not only on the product but also on processes, manage-
ment, customer relations and internal teamwork. Basically, to share positive and nega-
tive experiences from daily work. The layout of a white book is a digital document 
consisting of a template, thus the respondents have highlighted pros and cons with it. 
For example, in some cases the format might be too rigid, and consequently con-
strains the author’s possibilities to fill it in. The template guide authors to document 
different project activities and management aspects by proposing titles and subtitles, 
and this is found as a benefit since it provides consistency across projects. Also, the 
white book template propose that the project should be assessed by an outside party. 
4.1 
How a White Book Is Used 
A typical project in the company could be described as often global and long lasting. 
In Figure 1, an overview of a project is exemplified. The left column named resources 
shows that 37 persons are directly involved in the project and assigned to activities. 
From an analysis of contacts to these 37 persons, it has been found that many more 
people are involved on the basis of specific tasks. These contacts are relying on a 
person-to-person connection and are not exemplified in Figure 1. 
In a typical project, specific technologies, knowledge and skills are needed to con-
duct the necessary activities. Over the four years, 2007-2011, only one person has 
been involved throughout the whole project time, in this case it was not the project 
leader.  
Commonly, a project leader participates the whole project time, but due to allocat-
ing available resources on an as needed basis, people come in and go out of projects. 
Thus, people work part time in this project and part time in other projects. Typically, 
each engineer is involved in more than 3 projects simultaneously. Consequently, 
transferring and sharing knowledge is of utmost concern. Overlapping activities and 
meetings are used to support experiences and knowledge to be shared. However, a 
grand challenge in global projects is to assess whether or not the transfer has been 
successful. Respondents have expressed that there are dimensions of ‘lost in transla-
tion’, particularly in written text. The respondents—which can be interpreted as being 
experienced project members—have expressed that in particular the state-of-practice 
is not straightforwardly transferred or shared. For example, understanding the back-
ground for a certain aspect of a problem can originate from previous projects long 
time ago. Getting access to such experiences is hard if the employee is occupied in a 
new project or even worse if an employee is retired or has a new employment.

Fig. 1. The involvement of project members over time 
Based on the longitudinal data acquired in this study, it can be seen that the indi-
viduals’ perception of the objective with white books differs; this can in particular be 
seen in comparison between different departments and sites in the organization. For 
example, what is a positive and a negative experience and what kind of recommenda-
tions a project member prescribes depend on the persons pre-knowledge and domain 
of expertise. Thus, the text in the white book is inconsistently interpreted, and subse-
quently what the author intended and what the reader interpret does not correspond to 
the experiences searching for. Also, the situation where the author of the white book 
is also the receiver of the white book can occur, due to people coming in and out of 
different projects. 
A key point in white books is that the experiences should describe the learning 
process for gaining them, yet this is hard to express. Some respondents stress that 
experiences relate to hunches, intuition, muscle memory and so forth. The situation 
where experiences are communicated by referring to a previous project in the words, 
but not stating, for example that projects impact on the development processes, is by 
the respondents identified as decreasing the possibilities for sharing.  
When interviewing, i.e., listening to the respondents’ descriptions, a more in-depth 
view of experiences can be found. Such “stories” reveal a more detailed and reflective 
view on experiences than what can be found in the white books. For example, one 
respondent described a positive experience from a supplier business partnership, in

particular the approach of how the work had been broken down into separate units 
and how the units had been assigned to the company and to the supplier respectively 
was clearly expressed as a successful approach. The respondent could explain the 
reasons for doing so, and what kind of effects it had to the project as a whole. Follow-
ing up the interview by reading the relevant white book, it could be seen that this was 
not mentioned. A possible interpretation of the discrepancy can be that the story told 
might be too long to capture under a subtitle, and especially in written text. Further, 
the respondent mentioned a top-one experience in the interview, but this experience 
was mentioned either in the white book. A possible interpretation of this is that some 
experiences needs to be digested before being perceived as a lesson learned.  
It is suggested that white books should be used continuously during projects, but 
this is not done in general. Besides time pressure and project deadlines, a possible 
interpretation could be that reflecting over lessons learned in written text is a process 
that does not fit into the daily routines. A recommendation for the contents in white 
books is to clarify how decisions have been made; however micro-decision points are 
abundant in product development activities and embedded in routines. Further, how a 
team makes decisions differs from the common approach in another team, and this 
could relate to how domain specific knowledge has to be managed. To aid under-
standing there is a need to describe the context for the decisions, and this is yet anoth-
er hard to do task on the basis of a white book template and format.  
Respondents have also described that fairly old solutions can be of interest for a 
new project, if so the technology as such is not in focus, since it is outdated, but how 
problems were solved and what kind of concepts that was turned down, maybe due to 
immature technology at that time, is of utmost interest. However, getting access to, 
first, old documents is found tricky, and second information about the process and 
decisions are often lacking. 
Respondents have explained that it is hard to address a certain reader when author-
ing a white book, in parallel it also become hard to fulfill the task of describing expe-
riences. By this, the reflection on the experiences and lessons learned does not have a 
clear context or clear boundaries. Thus, the respondents describe that they, from time 
to time, have the feeling of just conducting a task when authoring white books. Final-
ly, the respondents have expressed that they as readers of previous white books find 
the disconnection from the final project report as troublesome. The experiences and 
lessons learned needs to be put into the context of the specific conditions of a project 
and into the nature of the development task. 
The respondents were in the interviews asked to rank their personal view in rela-
tion to the guidance of each title and subtitle in the white book template, the constrain 
was to rank them in relation their usefulness of different phases of project, start up, 
duration, ending and transition to another project. It was indicated that the white 
books were more useful when being an experienced project member, due to being 
more informed about previous projects and who the project leader had been. And, that 
the white books were used to check up issues occasionally, rather than continuously. 
This finding is supported after investigating 25 white books, 24 of them state that no 
white book was available to review before project start, and 1 of them provided 
slightly more text. However, the texts did not provide any further information that 

454 
J. Holmqvist and Å. Ericson 
 
was found useful. In relation to this, the respondents stressed the difficulties to find 
the appropriate white book and also that the often insufficient text was usually not 
providing enough depth for practical actions.  
4.2 
Delimitations of a White Book Approach 
Experience based knowledge falls into the category of tacit knowledge and in line 
with the characteristics for that category the knowing is not simply recognized, ex-
pressed and thus not easily formalized. The debate about how to define knowledge 
could be seen as an academic issue, for practical reasons companies commonly does 
not argue about what it is and what it is not. However, there is a difference in how 
companies apply information systems and knowledge systems, and subsequently they 
distinguish information management from knowledge management. When focusing 
the knowledge management domain, the two waves, the first one aiming for control 
and monitoring, and the second aiming for the sharing and creation of new know-
ledge, can be used to exemplify how experiences can be made more visible to the 
organization. Also, the difference between a “transfer” approach and a “sharing” ap-
proach could be to a certain extent clarified. 
Experiences should; “enabling individuals to gain actionable understanding” [17]. 
Turban and Aronson [18] also give a practical explanation of knowledge particular in 
relation to computer-supported decision systems, they state “knowledge is informa-
tion in action”. Systems like KBE, CAD, PDM and PLM fulfill one part of  
knowledge management in industry, but as seen in the efforts to author white books 
experiences and lessons learned are of utmost interest. The KBE, CAD and PLM 
systems focus on providing support for product related knowledge, and PDM is a tool 
to support the project organization and coordination. The main focus of the white 
book approach is to identify, capture and disseminate experiences that cannot be for-
malized and thereby does not fit into existing computer systems. The number one 
purpose of white books is to, as stated in description provided of the case company, to 
summarize positive and negative experiences, and recommended actions from the 
whole project time. For this, continuous work with the white book in parallel with 
daily activities is needed. It has been found that such an approach is not feasible, and 
it can be discussed whether or not the format and the layout of the template might 
instill barriers for experience sharing and knowledge transfer between projects. 
Also, the study have found that white books does not sufficiently support the start 
up stage of a new project, hence it can be argued that the white book approach in its 
current state is not appropriate for knowledge transfer between projects. Also, for this 
issue, the format and layout could hinder the necessary communication in the transi-
tion stage between projects. This is also recognized by the company, which has  
implemented a transition approach, where “mentor/apprentice” by one project team to 
another and face-to-face meetings are included. Such an approach is more efficient 
and affordable in co-located projects, but quickly becomes a high-cost approach in 
global teams. 
The white book template encouraged the projects to get a second opinion from an 
objective actor, i.e., a person not directly involved in the project. This has been found

as more or less an open innovation approach [19], because external partners provide 
input. Such an approach could be supposed not being particularly common in manu-
facturing industry due to more focus on intellectual properties. This part is found as 
not having a direct effect on the project work, but provide a channel for sharing  
experiences. 
Table 2 provides a list of possible requirements for how experience sharing could 
be supported. The objectives and requirements are based on theory and the discussion 
of the empirical data in this study.

Concluding Remarks and Implications for PSS 
This paper discusses the white book approach and its delimitations for transferring 
experiences between different projects in early product development. To address the 
purpose of the paper a white book approach has been an interest. Interviews with 
white book authors and an analysis of 25 white books has been the empirical base. It 
has been discussed that the written format could delimit, or rather become a barrier, in 
the transfer and sharing of experiences between project teams. Also, templates provid-
ing guidelines for how to author white books have been discussed. It has been found 
that guidelines provide consistency, but also hinders individual differences when in-
terpreting the contents. 
In the case of extending business relationships to incorporate PSS development, 
collaboration across company boundaries is stated to be a key factor for successful 
products. Also, the necessity to incorporate the service expertise domain into early 
development stages is an established perspective of PSS development. One manageri-
al implication for PSS development is that the knowledge transfer and experience 
sharing seem to become even more important, yet, as far as we know, a delimited 
effort is done to support these softer and more social aspects to support start up of 
PSS projects. Another managerial implication is the high degree of experience based 
knowledge in service development and provision, and that knowledge based systems 
in engineering design are not readily implemented on such type of knowledge. There 
are efforts done to take into account the more explicit parts of service related know-
ledge to support control and monitoring, i.e., based on a first wave approach to know-
ledge management. Still, similar efforts, for instance drawing from the benefits of 
rules of thumbs, could become a breakthrough for the realization of truly result-
oriented PSS solutions.

Abstract. Many companies have been using lessons learned practices as one of 
their key knowledge management initiatives to capitalize on past experiences. 
For product development companies, learning from product lifecycle phases 
gives a true competitive advantage to improve the next generation of products. 
However, companies are still struggling in capturing and sharing lessons 
learned and applying them in new situations. Based on this consideration, the 
paper proposes a video-based approach–using social media technologies–as a 
way to leverage continuous capturing and sharing lessons learned from product 
lifecycle phases to design practices. The paper presents the findings of a case 
study within the aerospace industry, which investigates the current industrial 
practices with regard to experience feedback, and illustrates the implementation 
of a video-based approach. Further, the conceptual mock-up of video-based les-
sons learned sharing portal and its social platform that are aimed to support the 
design practices are illustrated.

Introduction 
Learning from experience for competitive advantage has received a great deal of  
attention in recent years [1] [2]. Since product development is an iterative problem-
solving process [3], many companies have been using past experiences in form of 
lessons learned to guide the design of future products in order to avoid reinventing the 
wheel each time by accessing its past mistakes or successes [4] [5]. Managing expe-
riences is becoming even more important as manufacturing companies are undergoing 
a fundamental shift in their business operations and are increasingly moving away 
from the selling of products to the provision of services or Product-Service Systems 
(PSS) [6] [7]. At an extreme side of this product-service journey, companies are offer-
ing ‘function of the product’ instead of hardware, retaining ownership and responsi-
bility for the product throughout its entire lifecycle [7]. This affects the way new 
products are conceptualized and designed in the early phases, wherein the focus is 
shifted from satisfying artifact’s physical characteristics to reducing the overall

product lifecycle costs while maintaining performance efficiency [8]. In this setting, 
reuse of experiences from different phases of product lifecycle, such as business, design, 
manufacturing, usage, maintenance, and recycling, play a key role to support design 
teams to address the relevant lessons from the past issues in new designs [9] [10].  
Researchers have proposed different approaches to address this gap in a PSS set-
ting. Baxter et al. [11] proposed a knowledge base structure grounded on three core 
elements of knowledge such as design, manufacturing capability and service to sup-
port the design activity. Vianello [6] proposed a documentation model to reuse of 
knowledge from the service phase of complex products and has identified that the 
designers require in-service information at a component level to improve next genera-
tion of products through design. Further, studies, for example [12] [13], develop KBE 
[12], PLM [13] based solutions to capture, analyze and reuse both manufacturing 
experiences [12] and product use experiences [13] in the new designs. However, the 
current research on experience feedback primarily based on explicit (objective, codi-
fied) field data e.g. condition monitoring, operation and service data and statistical 
databases, there is very limited focus on utilizing experiential learning that occurs 
through tacit (subjective, implicit) knowledge and social interactions. As highlighted 
by Clarkson and Eckert [14], “traditionally, large amounts of knowledge and expe-
rience are never written down and are only stored in the heads of individuals  
(p. 328)”. Lessons learned (here after referred as “LL” in the text) practices are there-
fore failed to deliver the intended results as lessons are identified and are often not 
followed through and applied within the organization [15]. Furthermore, LL practices 
are limited to a ‘single department’ or to ‘specific projects’, lacking contextualized 
information for reuse it in the new situations [16]. Major issues also refer to staff 
turnover, reassignment of people to the new projects, time-consumption for capturing 
LL as well as the time lapses in LL capturing [4]. Hence, there is a need for practical, 
easy, social-based approach that can help organizations to regularly capture and share 
LL from product lifecycle phases to early design practices.  
On the authors’ advice, Web 2.0 or Social Media technologies look particularly in-
teresting to enable capturing and sharing of individual/team experiences and tacit 
knowledge, as well as to improve communication across functional and organizational 
boundaries [17]. Accordingly, the objective of the paper is to propose a video-based 
approach–using social media technologies–for capturing LL from different product 
lifecycle phases and feed that back to early design practices. The paper presents the 
findings of a case study within the aerospace industry, including the current industrial 
practice with regard to experience feedback and the implementation of a video-based 
LL approach. Further, the conceptual mock-up of video-based LL sharing portal and 
its social platform that are aimed to support the design practices are illustrated.

Experience Feedback and Social Media: A Literature Review 
Experience Feedback is a knowledge management initiative whose objective is to 
convey experiential knowledge or lessons learned applicable to an operational, tactic-
al, or strategic level such that, when reused, this knowledge positively impacts on the

results of the organization [4]. The lessons learned from problem-solving include: 
lessons about the domain, lessons about how to find information that is useful to the 
problem-solver, and the information about the resources that are useful in particular 
contexts [18]. Several researchers identified that narratives and story telling give the 
richest opportunities for articulating and sharing tacit and experiential knowledge [5] 
[16], especially when the lessons are high-context and situation specific [2]. Milton 
[2] stated that a story could support a lesson by providing valuable background and 
context, facilitating to understand the context when a new person reviewing the les-
son, thereby guiding the person whether it applies within the new context or not. 
In this perspective, videos seem to be a well-suited medium for supporting tacit 
knowledge transfer, because they bring rich context–not detached and compartmenta-
lized like text [19]. A recent McKinsey study [20] found that video sharing is one of 
the most adopted social media tool in companies (i.e., top 3 with 38%). Videos are 
especially useful for scanning the external environment and capturing subtle and 
complex aspects of performed activities and to represent overviews of key dynamic 
processes [21]. Web 2.0-enabled capabilities facilitate video hosting services, which 
could allow individuals to upload video clips to Internet websites to capture and 
communicate stories with a richer and more dynamic content [22]. Additionally, Web 
2.0 offers annotations, tagging, bookmarking, commenting, editing, and ranking func-
tionalities [17] to increase the ability to share, network, find and discuss videos across 
dispersed boundaries. According to a 2010 survey among advanced manufacturing 
industries [23], social media tools (such as: social networking sites, video sharing, 
blogs, wikis and micro-blogs) are beneficial to share best practices and to quickly 
identify experts based on content they have uploaded on their profiles or conversa-
tions held on accessible social platforms. Wood et al. [21] investigated using videos to 
elicit and transmit the tacit nature of skilled practices and have created a wiki-based 
learning resource for novice craft practitioners, which offered a more flexible way of 
developing and refining their crafting skills. Further, Shariff et al. [24] added features 
to LL systems to allow users to upload media files, such as pictures and videos, to 
support a socialization process as well as to promote lessons reuse.

Methodology 
The paper is based on a case study [25] performed in collaboration with an aero-
engine component manufacturer, which develops and manufactures components for 
gas turbine-, aircraft- and rocket engines. The company usually acts as a design-make 
supplier to major aero engine manufacturers, in various product and technology de-
velopment projects. The company works as an independent risk and revenue sharing 
partner, and assumes responsibility for certain engine components, from design, man-

The company has recently implemented a Design Practice (DP) System to capture and 
structure product specific activities and related methods for each component against 
stage-gate product development process [26]. The system encompasses flows, activi-
ties, and methods to guide design and development work. The DP flow indicates 

462 
K. Chirumalla, M. Bertoni, and C. Johansson 
 
which activities to be done, in which order, within a project phase, for a specific en-
gine component. The documents related to activities and methods are stored in DMS 
(Document Management Systems) and searchable in DP system. The case study has 
been performed on DP system to identify solution alternatives to foster experience 
and lessons learned sharing across product lifecycle phases regardless of projects and 
organizational boundaries. Empirical data has been collected through observations at 
the company and interviews with DP system and product lifecycle stakeholders, 
which include engineers, system owner, business developer, design leaders, manufac-
turing and quality leaders, process owners, and product support leaders. The inter-
views and observations are focused on three things: First is to develop a richer  
understanding on current management of experience feedback along the product life-
cycle phases. Second is to get feedback on the applicability of using video-based  
approach that is proposed by the authors. Third is to perform testing activities at the 
companies’ facilities to verify the integration with the DP system. This paper is based 
on the case study results from testing the video-based approach and the conceptual 
scenarios that were discussed to support the DP system with continuous experience 
feedback.

As-Is Practice in Experience Feedback: An Example  
Since the case company is moving forward to take over the product lifecycle respon-
sibility, the product support team is dealing with operational problems of components 
wherein they have not been involved during the design of these components. The 
team is therefore increasingly searching for past experiences or the answers to the 
decisions that have been taken previously. For instance, what we have agreed with  
the customer? Why? Who took certain decisions on what basis?  
Figure 1 illustrates an example for identifying past experiences when a product 
support personal received a problem from the customer. If it is an easy or known 
problem, the personal knows whom to contact to resolve the problem or get some help 
to know the references to old reports in the DMS. If it is an ill-defined problem, then 
there are mainly three options available to resolve the situation, including: asking 
seniors or colleagues in their department, searching in the DMS, or raising the issue in 
the weekly department meeting. If any senior is familiar with the problem, then he/she 
can send some old reports or else recommend a person X that could be helpful. The 
person X could send some reports in case he/she understands the problem by phone or 
email, otherwise, he/she may request for a meeting to discuss the issue further. The 
meeting might be helpful to identify some past experiences. If not the knowledge 
seeker will inform the project team that there was no past experience available to the 
given problem and there is a need to come up with a new solution by performing an 
analysis. Alternatively, the person can search for the past experiences in the DMS. 
However, in the DMS, one can only search with the title names if he/she knows what 
to look for in the DMS. For example, if one can type the word “milling” in the search 
title, then he/she will get all the documentation that have the title name milling. The 
person has to open all the documents to check if there is any relevant document.

If there were any document outside of his/her working context, then he/she wouldn’t 
have the access to open it. In that case he/she needs to make a request to access them. 
Once the personal gets the access, he/she reads the documents. If there is any relevant 
document, then the personal usually gives a call to the person who wrote that docu-
ment or the people who were working in that project to make sure that this past  
experience would applicable in his/her context.  
 
Fig. 1. An example for identifying past experiences in the product support phase 
Figure 2 illustrates how the experience feedback is usually happened in the above 
example. In case the problem is a smaller issue, the product support personal docu-
ments a short analysis report. If it is a damage or non-conformance, then the personal 
has to dig into the archives in correspondence with the supplier and the customer and 
summarize the results in a “summary report”, including answering questions such as 
why the problems were occurred? What they were discovered? What decisions were 
taken?  
From this report, 10-15 lessons learned are identified in order to make a list of  
actions to the different departments to avoid repeating the same mistakes again in the 
next products. The audit department usually makes the follow up and is informed to 
different managers to make actions in their respective departments as shown in Figure 
2. According to the informant most of these lessons are useful in the pre-study and 
concept study to inform the designers: “you should think about this if you design a 
part that goes in to casting process”. If the lesson might have to do with the definition 
work, then it needs to go to product definition department to make a new DP in case 
there is no DP available, otherwise it adds to the checklist in the design review 
process. If the lesson is regarding the casting manufacturing process, then it can result 
in an alert report, which can be sent out to all casting suppliers with the recommenda-
tions. Eventually, this “summary report” is stored in the DMS with references to other 
reports. However, people that are working in the same project can only access to this

Fig. 2. Experience feedback process from the product support phase for the above example  
document. Other people can see that there is a document, but they cannot open it. “I 
don’t know how these lessons learned that we identified is actually spread to other 
projects and departments” described the informant. By commenting on identifying 
experiences he said that: “of course this knowledge is only comes to me because I am 
the one is asking for it. It should be stored some where. So everyone could see it, 
right?”. The problem in documenting the lessons learned report from the projects is 
highlighted by one of the informants: “[I think] no one really wrote those reports 
anyway. Because they thought it is not so important…we are so busy writing the re-
ports we need to, for the clients. They require certain numbers and types of reports. 
That’s what we focus on. This lessons learned template is something you have to do 
when you get sometime over…I would say [that] those reports have a low priority”. 
The above example evidently illustrates the difficulty in documenting, identifying 
and accessing the past experiences and is emphasizing the importance of personal 
networks and social connections in the experience feedback process.

Experience Feedback Using Social Media: An Approach for 
Capturing Lessons Learned through Videos  
The preliminary experimental results at case company identified that videos are bene-
ficial for capturing lessons learned (LL) as they can capture the context of dynamic 
problem situations and that reduces time-consuming manual processes while captur-
ing lessons in a continuous manner compared to a more text-based approach of docu-
menting LL. However, capturing an LL video is not merely about making a video 
with some stories from a project. The LL video must be factual, technically correct, 
valid and applicable to specific tasks and processes. Hence, the authors have  

 
Experience Feedback Using Social Media 
465 
 
developed a method for capturing LL videos as a means to provide the structure and 
to lower the threshold for the people who want to share their lessons. The method to 
structure the LL videos contains seven steps as shown in Table 1. Each step has a set 
of guiding questions to support the users in formulating their message in a clear, con-
cise, and informative manner for each section of the LL video as shown in Table 1.  
The video-based LLs process consists of six stages, including: (1) Identifying the 
LL during an activity, (2) Preparing and formulate a LL story using the steps and 
guidelines in the below LL template, (3) Recording the LL video, storing and sharing 
with proposed tags and secrecy level settings, (4) Validating and disseminating the LL 
with secrecy level and tags settings, (5) Searching and retrieving the LL using the 
tags, and (6) Reusing the LL in new activities.

As seen in Figure 3, the LL video displays annotations of LL template topics/steps 
as an overlay on top of the video. The observations showed that this way of 
representing the LL videos allows the knowledge seekers to browse for interesting 
topics of LL instead of going through whole video. Additionally, the experimental 
observation also considered having “browsing points” on the video status bar, which 
symbolize the 7 topics in the captured LL story. The observations also revealed that 
these capabilities built on top of the LL video could allow the users to browse and 
absorb many LL videos in a shorter time span. The empirical observations highlighted 
several bookmark links to be considered in the platform, including, but not limited to, 
“share”, “product lifecycle timeline”, “validator” and “secrecy level”. For instance, 
the “Share” bookmark link can facilitate an LL contributor to quickly add video clips 
to the project blogs, intranet, departmental sites, and so on.

Benefit of the Approach for Industrial Use 
According to the previous research [6], design teams like to access the past expe-
riences at a component level. However, the As-Is practices are majorly ad-hoc, 
project- based which does not support the designer to access the past experiences at a 
component level with a richer context. The company is changing the process flows 
within DP system based on LL reports, eventually missing the rationale why they 
have changed a certain process. As observed during the study, DP system lacks sup-
port for handling the lessons learned from various projects, especially concerning 
lessons from the downstream processes such as manufacturing, serial production, 
product support and maintenance. Furthermore, the study found that the lessons with 
high-context such as casting and welding operations are harder to explain and report 
in the text-based document. Video-based LL approach could allow product lifecycle 
stakeholders to capture the lessons with an illustrated story and share it to the product 
lifecycle timeline per each component as shown in Figure 4. Within the DP system, 
this practice could allow designers to access related LL from various projects on the 
same page together with the best practice documents. In this way, videos can carry a 
learning point that is specific, actionable recommendation to the component designers 
in the early phases, enabling to access more context-specific lessons compared to the 
traditional project-specific lessons learned documents. Such practice can help conti-
nuous capturing and disseminating of the lessons learned from the downstream 
processes, which could help the design teams accessing properties governing lifecycle 
behavior in the early conceptual stage per each component.  
Another technology enabler for developing social ties across organization is to le-
verage conversations around LL videos. The study found that adding commenting 
functionalities related to the LL videos allow other people in the organizations go 
through the video and add their relevant comments to the LL story. In addition, add-
ing “like,” rating, follow the user and “embed” social features in the portal enhances 
the bottom-up and social networking capabilities across boundaries. Based on prelim-
inary experiments, the LL video-based approach, in this way, can capture the rich 
context of lessons learned and feed that back to early design practices, thereby leve-
raging cross-functional sharing and networking across borders.

Concluding Remarks and Future Work 
This paper has proposed a video-based approach–using social media technologies–as 
a way to lower the threshold for continuous capturing and sharing lessons learned 
(LL) from the product lifecycle phases to the design practices, supporting front-
loading in product development by enabling experience feedback from product life-
cycle phases. The approach encompasses a LL capturing template, guidelines, process 
description and technological enablers. The approach is based on a 7-step template, 
which is intended to facilitate the capturing of contextual information and tacit know-
ledge compared to what is already available in literature. Preliminary verification 
activities have shown such a solution improves the preparation and formulation of LL 
in a story format compared to other traditional templates and recording means. The 
study identified that the video-based approach is beneficial to give manufacturing, 
operational and maintenance inputs to early phases of design practices at a component 
level. In the future, the study will extend to the development of a full-scale prototype

system, using open-source video sharing applications. The prototype will serve the 
purpose of testing the viability and performances of approach by experimental means, 
observing and analyzing through a range of experiments how social media mechan-
isms can support designers by enabling experience sharing across product lifecycle 
phases in emerging product development trends such as PSS.

Abstract. Manufacturing enterprises are making more efforts in providing high 
value added services in addition to their traditional product business. A service-
centric product service system (PSS) is present in this paper which is used as a 
decision support tool and offers a means of supporting decision-making for 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) solution finding. Requirement analy-
sis technologies are used to identify the final important rating and the technical 
targets of engineering characteristics (ECs), and reduce the redundant ECs. An 
ontology-based knowledge representation is developed to represent, accumulate 
and collect knowledge and experience emerged during the MRO services, 
which realizes the knowledge originated from the service process and served 
operations. An initial attemp has been made to demonstrate the role of PSS as a 
decision support tool for MRO in the aerospace manufacturing business. 
Keywords: PSS, MRO, Requirement Analysis, Knowledge Management, Aer-
ospace manufacturing.

Introduction 
Companies that direct their efforts toward meeting their customer requirements (CRs) 
produce higher-quality products, provide customized services, ensure a higher degree 
of customer satisfaction, and earn more revenue. All these beneﬁts are achieved by 
minimized internal conflicts, cut down turn around time, and made the greater market 
penetration. The concept of Product Service System (PSS) has been proposed and 
investigated to better exploit the potential benefits of integrating product development 
with related services. Practical industrial cases implementing PSS have been investi-
gated in recent years. For example, William [1] applied PSS in the automotive indus-
try. Meier and Krug [2] proposed a PSS solution to the integration of the development 
and supply of products and services. Mittermeyer [3] applied PSS in health care. Qu 
[4] applied PSS to serve as a production process. In the aerospace industry, mainten-
ance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services are normally provided during product 
usage. Given that an airplane is a durable product with a life span of over 30 years, 
opportunities abound for the application of PSS in aviation maintenance, repair and 

474

overhaul. The profitability of the aviation industry is not just from the sale of air-
crafts, but also from maintaining them for an anticipated lifespan. This research will 
focus on applying PSS in the aviation industry to specifically support the MRO  
services.  
In the current practice of manufacturing industry, MRO services seriously depend 
on individuals’ experience, which makes the services unstable and uncontrollable. It 
is realized that knowledge obtained from previous projects is hosted by individual 
experts, and in turn, individual experts use previous knowledge into new MRO ser-
vices and obtain new knowledge from them. This makes knowledge sharing and reuse 
in the service team and related personnel inefficient and ineffective, and thus makes 
the project risky. To solve such problems during product service activities, the needs 
of knowledge representation in the process of product services are discussed in this 
paper, and an ontology-based knowledge representation method for product service 
process is proposed. To better manage the ontology, a solution for ontology manage-
ment is developed for ontology definition and building, and evaluation of semantic 
similarities of concepts among ontology domain. The logical structure and details of 
the knowledge involved in the product service process are described by ontology 
building. An ontology-based knowledge representation framework has been devel-
oped for the reuse of knowledge unambiguously, which realizes the knowledge origi-
nated from the current and previous service processes.  
Some of the service offering approaches used in service business include full ser-
vices, solution selling and total care solutions [5]. The PSS proposed in this research 
can be regarded as a kind of outsourcing service, which is designed to support deci-
sion making in MRO services. In the current industrial environment, manufacturing 
enterprises are asked to respond rapidly and adjust dynamically to external market 
and customer requirement changes. The PSS development is a systematic and cross-
functional design activity [6]. Although product design and service design focus on 
different aspects, both product and service should be considered to satisfy the re-
quirements of customers. Quality function deployment (QFD), as an effective cus-
tomer-driven design tool, has been used successfully to translate CRs into ECs in 
product or service design. It can be translating CRs into ECs in PSS development. 
Rough set theory is a relatively new and intelligent knowledge discovery tool. It is 
widely used to ﬁnd data dependencies, evaluate the importance of attributes, reveal 
data patterns, reduce the number of redundant objects and attributes, and seek the 
minimum subset of attributes [7-10,]. In this research, the Rough set theory approach 
has been mainly used to reduce the number of redundant ECs, which created by trans-
lating from CRs. The analytic network process (ANP) approach has been used to 
prioritize ECs in order to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional QFD models 
[11-13]  
The main aim of this project is to develop a PSS, and apply it in the aerospace 
manufacturing industry focusing on the MRO services. To meet the customer re-
quirements emerged during the use phase of product, a framework of PSS based on 
the requirement analysis is put forward, which integrates Quality Function Develop-
ment (QFD), rough set theory, ANP approach and ontology-based knowledge reason-
ing methods. The mapping relationships between customer requirements and

engineering characteristics are identified based on QFD-ANP analysis, as well as the 
weight of characteristics. An ontology-based knowledge reasoning method is used to 
find the semantically similar generalized product service cases. The PSS configura-
tion scheme set is obtained by optimizing and assessing the selected cases. The refer-
ence service solutions for the specific customer requirements will be created using the 
proposed PSS. The proposed methodology will be developed using web technology to 
provide lifecycle services and supports, which can be easily accessed through the 
internet at all times and places. An initial attempt is made to describe the potential 
value of the PSS in the aerospace manufacturing industry and also to describe how to 
provide lifecycle services and supports in industry based on the proposed web-based 
PSS framework.

Current Limitations and Objectives of This Research 
PSS was first proposed by Goedkoop [14] who described a PSS as a system of prod-
ucts, services, networks of ‘players’ and supporting infrastructure that continuously 
strives to be competitive, satisfy customer needs and have a lower environmental 
impact than traditional business models. The general category of PSS includes prod-
uct-oriented PSS, use-oriented PSS, and result-oriented PSS [15, 16]. Many systemic 
and scientific frameworks for modeling PSS have been proposed. However, most 
researchers only focused on product-orientated PSS. Only a few reported use-
orientated PSS and result-orientated PSS, where service is considered as the core part 
whilst physical products are only carriers for service delivery.  
Due to the increasing interests on environmental problems and government regula-
tions for recycling and reusing, considering product lifecycle factors on service activi-
ties as well as customer requirements is increasingly more important than in the past. 
However, only a few QFD works have considered product lifecycle requirements into 
the process of QFD in spite of its importance [17]. Moreover, most researchers only 
consider quantitative correlations among engineering characteristics in original QFD. 
Even though some engineering characteristics have a positive or negative effect on 
each other, the original QFD method oversimplifies this correlation in the prioritiza-
tion of engineering characteristics. 
In this research, a requirement-oriented PSS will be developed using requirement 
analysis and knowledge management methodologies, which is suitable for use-
orientated PSS and result-orientated PSS. The customer and product lifecycle factors 
will be incorporated in this research, and exert their significant impacts to the imple-
mentation and performance of PSS. The positive and negative effects among different 
engineering characteristics will be analyzed; a systemic decision-making approach 
will be used to identify the relative prioritization of engineering characteristics.

The Proposed Methodology 
Currently, manufacturing enterprises are making more efforts to provide high value 
added services in addition to their traditional design and manufacturing business, 

476 
H. Zhu, J. Gao, and D. Li 
 
engender a higher degree of customer satisfaction, and earn more revenue. A  
requirement-oriented PSS has been developed using requirement analysis and know-
ledge management technologies. The proposed PSS will be regarded as a decision 
support tool and offer a means of supporting decision-making for MRO services solu-
tion in this research. The reference service solutions for the specific customer re-
quirements will be created using the proposed PSS. Figure 1 is the general approach 
of providing supports and services by the Web-based PSS, which can be divided into 
4 steps which are described below.

The Requirement Analysis and Knowledge Management Methodologies in a PSS 
477 
 
• 
Step 1: Requirements management: to acquire the requirements, and identify 
satisfactory ECs using requirements analysis methodologies. The redundant ECs 
will be reduced, and the important weight of reduced ECs will be defined accu-
rately.  
• 
Step 2: Service knowledge representation based on ontologies: Service ontology 
is build to represent, accumulate and store knowledge and experience emerged 
during service activities. Ontology-based knowledge representation is proposed 
to collect and formalize service cases and store them as knowledge in the know-
ledge repository. 
• 
Step 3: Knowledge reasoning by ontology-based knowledge representation: the 
knowledge-based method is used here to help and support users for service solu-
tion finding. When the service activities are formalized by referring to the prede-
fined ontologies, the formalized services will be reasoned in the knowledge  
repository to find semantically similar generalized service cases. 
• 
Step 4: Optimizing and accessing: the technical targets which are identified by 
requirements analysis will be used to evaluateand access the reference service so-
lutions and find the optimal solution for the specific requirements.

Technologies for Implementing the Proposed PSS 
Three key techniques used in the proposed PSS are introduced in depth in this section, 
i.e., how to determine the final important ratings of ECs by analyzing the require-
ments; how to represent the MRO activities and the relationships between them by 
ontology; how to reuse the service knowledge which are collected from service cases, 
and use the reasoning method to find the similar generally service cases in the know-
ledge repository. 
4.1 
Requirement Analysis 
It is not easy to identify satisfactory engineering characteristics because the informa-
tion in the early stage of product service system planning is subjective, qualitative, 
and even uncertain to engineers. As a well-known planning and problem-solving me-
thodology, QFD is used to support product service system design in this research. A 
step by step proceduce, starting from requirements acquiring until the prioritization 
stage, is described below. 
Acquire customer voices or requirements from customer and market. The mentioned 
requirements here are including internal requirements and external requirements. The 
former consists of the requirements emerged during different phases of product life 
cycle, e.g., design, manufacturing, usage, disposal. The external requirements are not 
only customers' requirements, but also providers' and partners' requirements. The 
methods of acquiring are mainly including survey, interview, self-report, observation 
and so on. For complete or near complete sentences, begin with a capital letter and 

478 
H. Zhu, J. Gao, and D. Li 
 
end with a full stop. Acquire customer voices or requirements from customer and 
market.  
 
Identify general requirements and the relationship among these requirements. Firstly, 
three distinct types of information must be identified from requirements acquiring, 
e.g., Jobs, Outcomes, Constraints. Jobs represent what the customers are trying to get 
done when using the product or MRO service. Outcomes indicate what the customers 
are trying to achieve when performing these jobs. Constraints describe the roadblocks 
that stand in the way of them performing a specific job. After identifying general 
requirements, there may be three kinds of relationships between any two require-
ments: a positive relationship, a negative relationship, and a non-relationship, respec-
tively. Then, the positive and negative effects between these requirements will be 
analyzed, and the important weightings of CRs will be calculated by ANP method. 
 
Develop ECs from CRs based on House of Quality (HoQ) model in QFD. HoQ model 
is primarily used to describe the relationships between and within CRs and ECs. The 
functional requirements (FRs) will be identified by analyzing the customer require-
ments (CRs). Then, the FRs in the functional domain will be translated into engineer-
ing characteristics (ECs) using QFD approach, including product-related ECs (P-ECs) 
and service-related ECs (S-ECs). A set of ECs candidates will be determined, some of 
the ECs candidates may be redundant, and the conflict relationship between the ECs 
candidates may also exist. Therefore, the further selection from the ECs candidates is 
essential. 
 
Reduce the redundant ECs. To identify the most important characteristics and remove 
the unnecessary ones in the EC set. Rough set theory as a relatively intelligent know-
ledge discover tool is used to evaluate the important of ECs, reduce the number of 
redundant ECs, and seek the minimum subset of ECs. The new EC set, which pro-
duced by attribute reduction, can fully characterize the knowledge, such as EC set is 
called a reduct. The reduct can be thought of as a sufficient set of engineering  
characteristics. 
 
Determine the relative weightings between CRs and the reduced ECs. A relationship 
between CRs and ECs is defind as “a decision matrix”. A decision matrix is created 
combining the result of the computation with calculated CRs. QFD method is used to 
obtain the importance weights of ECs based on CRs and relationships modeled in the 
HoQ. In order to accurately define the importance weights of ECs, the inter-dependency 
relationships between CRs and ECs (including P-ECs and S-ECs), the inter-dependency 
relationships between P-ECs and S-ECs, and the inner-dependency relationships among 
these three clusters should also be taken into consideration in QFD analysis. 
 
Calculate the overall weight of each ECs. To define the importance weights of ECs 
accurately, ANP method is used to form a network considering the interactions at 
different levels. Moreover, the relative weights of each EC will be calculated by ANP 
method.  
 
Determine the final important rating of ECs. The final weights of ECs are obtained based 
on QFD and HoQ. The technical targets of ECs are also determined. The most important 
ECs will be formalized by referring to a set of predefined ontology, and reasoned in the 
knowledge repository of the proposed PSS to find semantically similar generalized MRO

service cases. The technical targets will be used to evaulate and access the reference 
service solution and find the optimal solution for the specific requirements. 
4.2 
MRO Services Knowledge Representation 
Advanced computing methods and related technologies are changing the way engi-
neers interact with the information infrastructure. Knowledge management (KM) is 
widely used in service activities, and helpful to enhance enterprises' service capabili-
ties. As the basis of KM, knowledge representation formalisms and methods perform 
a decisive role in KM.  
As an appropriate representation scheme, ontology is adopted to effectively define 
the knowledge hierarchies in service activities and the relationships between them. 
Ontology describes the concepts in a domain of interest and the relationships that hold 
between those concepts [18, 19], as well as providing powerful tools for querying and 
information retrieval and automatic causality extraction using semantic similarity  
[20, 21]. Ontology is also used to address the semantic shortcomings and matchmak-
ing difficulties associated with semantic Web technology [22, 23]. In this research, 
service ontology is developed to represent the semantic information and relationships 
between functional modules and process modules. Moreover, the relationship infor-
mation between service functions and processes will be represented by ontology to 
provide the inputs, outputs and constraints for MRO processes design. The service 
engineering characteristics and product engineering characteristics are classified by 
knowledge representation to ﬁt the ontology structure. The solution for ontology 
management is shown in Figure 2, which mainly involves ontology defining and 
modeling, and semantic similarity evaluation. 
 
Fig. 2. Solution for Ontology Management

Ontology Defining and Modeling. The concepts used in the MRO process will be 
defined by knowledge manages and senior engineers. The mentioned concepts here, 
involve two parts, i.e. the predefined part and extended part. The former one can be 
considered as general engineering concepts, which is normally in higher level of ab-
straction. The extended part means the specifically concepts, which is used in the 
company and generated based on the predefined concepts. 
Suppose that the formalization of ontology can be described as: O=(S, RS, I). O 
represents the ontology; S represents the collection of all concepts, each concept in S 
can be regard as a class, and the class is inherited by subclass; I represents the in-
stances of the class; RS represents the relationship between every two concepts, i.e. 
part_of, has_part, Sibling_of, attribute_of, has_attribute, instance_of, has_instance, 
and so on. Protégé is adopted as an ontology editor to formalize predefined ontology 
in computer language, which was developed by Stanford University and used in the 
academic area for ontology development. By using the tool, the ontology is forma-
lized with OWL2 specifications. Physically it is stored in a XML file. The ontology 
definition file is processed and transformed using java technologies. The transformed 
ontology will be stored in a rational database, and be used with other parts of the  
system.  
Evaluation of Semantic Similarities of Concepts. The main aim of this step is to eva-
luate and rate semantic similarities between concepts. The rated ontology will be used 
in the knowledge repository management, and used to find the solution and support 
decision making in the other parts of the system. The evaluating and rating work will 
be conducted by engineers in the related departments. The rules of evaluation and 
rating are described below, which are carried out in two steps: (1) Evaluate and rate 
semantic similarities between the parent concept and its child concepts. (2) Evaluate 
and rate semantic similarities between sibling concepts.  
Suppose that S represents a set of services: S = {S1, S2, S3 … Sn}. Where S1 con-
sists of a set of MRO services and their functions. P represents the process of MRO 
service: P = {P1, P2, P3, …, Pn}. F represents the function of MRO service: F = {F1, 
F2, F3, …, Fn}. SP represents the sub-process of service, P1 consists of {SP11, SP12, 
SP13, …, SP1n}. Since P1 is the parent of SP11 and SP12, S1 is the parent of P1 and 
F1, P1 and F1 are siblings, which are described as: SP11
P1; SP12
P1 and P1
S1; F1
S1. Suppose that the number of engineers who are going to evaluate and rate 
the similarities between concepts is m. Each engineer will be given the credibility by 
knowledge manager according to their engineering experience, which represented as 
C = {C1, C2, C3, …, Cm}, more experienced engineers have higher credibility. Tak-
ing an example of rating semantic similarities between S1 and P1. The final result of 
semantic similarity Sim (S1, P1) can be represented as Equation (1). The similarity of 
the sibling classes (F1 and P2) can be represented as equation (2).

Ontology-based Knowledge Representation. To represent, accumulate and store 
knowledge and experience emerged during the MRO services, an ontology-based 
knowledge representation framework has been proposed to collect and formalize  
service cases from engineers' everyday work and store them as knowledge in the 
knowledge repository, as shown in Figure. 3.  
 
Fig. 3. The Framework of Ontology-based Service Knowledge Representation 
The proposed system is developed for the reuse of knowledge unambiguously, 
which realizes the knowledge originated from the service process and served service 
process. In this system, service cases are collected from various sources including 
different information systems and functional departments. The service cases are for-
malized in a hierarchical way, which clarifies the functions the service case is to ad-
dress. Moreover, the service cases can be further decomposed into components and 
characteristics. Therefore, the predefined ontology can be used to tag each element of 
the functional model and then the service case with tagged semantic meaning can be 
stored in the knowledge repository. The knowledge representation method will be 
applied to enable the proposed PSS that can provide users with various functions that 
are searching, sharing, and reusing information in the distributed environments.

A Knowledge-Based Method Support for Service Solution Finding 
A knowledge-based method is used here, to help and support engineers for service 
solution finding. When the mission and objectives of MRO service are identified by 
requirement analysis, the MRO service will be formalized by referring to the prede-
fined ontology. Then the formalized MRO service will be reasoned in the knowledge 
repository to find semantically similar generalized service cases. Therefore, speciﬁc 
service cases that are associated with generalised service cases can be retrieved. These 
selected service cases will be used as reference solutions for the current CRs.  
The aim of formalizing MRO activities is to formalize the service function model 
and the component where the service occurs. In this research, formalizing service 
activity is not only formalizing the service activity itself, but also formalizing inputs, 
outputs, resources, constraints, relationships between service functions and service 
processes. Figure 4 shows the MRO service model formalized by the pre-defined 
ontology. Product ontology defines the type of product and consists of system ontolo-
gy and component ontology. A product is composed of several subsystems such as 
flight control system, fuel system, electrical system, propulsion system and oxygen 
system, and each sub-system is composed of many components. Service ontology 
defines the methods, processes, activities, and organization in the MRO services. It 
can be divided into function ontology and process ontology. Flow ontology defines 
the type of the flow. The characteristic ontology defines the properties of the product 
and service activities. 
 
Fig. 4. Formalization of the MRO Model 
An ontology-based knowledge reasoning method is proposed to find semantically 
similar generalized service cases. The MRO activity is decomposed into inputs, out-
puts, resources, constraints, relationships between service functions and service 
processes, each of them will be tagged with predefined ontology. The reduced charac-
teristics of components and services which are identified by requirements analysis 
will be considered as important factors, and are also formalized with predefined on-
tology. After formalizing concepts for each parts of the decomposed service activity,

the semantic similar service case will be retrived by knowledge reasoning. These 
selected service cases will be used as reference solutions for the current CRs.

Conclusions and Further Work 
This paper presented on-going research into the development of a Web-based Product 
Service System using requirement analysis and knowledge management technologies. 
A service-centric PSS have been proposed which is suitable for result-orientated PSS 
and use-orientated PSS. The proposed PSS is used as a decision support tool and offer 
a means of supporting decision-making for MRO solution finding. QFD-ANP are 
used to identify the relationship among CRs, FRs and ECs, as wll as the final impor-
tant rating and the technical targets of ECs. Rough set theory is used to reduce the 
redundant ECs. Furthermore, Ontology-based knowledge representation has been 
developed to represent, accumulate and collect knowledge and experience emerged 
during the MRO services. Predefined ontologies have been stored in the knowledge 
repository of the proposed PSS. The most important ECs which are determined by 
requirements analysis, will be formalized by referring to a set of predefined ontology, 
and reasoned in the knowledge repository of the proposed PSS to find semantically 
similar generalized MRO service cases. The technical targets will be used to evaulate 
and access the reference service solution and find the optimal solution for the specific 
requirements. The emphasis of further work will be on the development of the pro-
posed PSS for evaluating and accessing the effectiveness of the operation, and apply-
ing the proposed PSS in the real industrial company. In the next stage of this research, 
integrating with other enterprise systems will be developed to acquire knowledge 
regarding contributions that previous cases made to related requirements.

Abstract. Besides the need for data availability and highly dynamic processes, 
IPS² is characterized by a very high degree of interaction between manufacturer, 
wholesaler, and customer with fluctuant intensity of requirement adaptations and 
changes within the IPS² network in various ways. In this paper, we will introduce 
an IPS² knowledge-based lifecycle management platform (IPS²-KOP) based on 
the principles of service oriented architecture (SOA) to solve the problem of 
streamlining processes and interfaces between collaborators. The coherence of the 
given data builds a valuable source for knowledge-based information retrieval, 
and therefore, new valuable data can be created and stored to supply the know-
ledge-based assistance systems, which support for example decision makers with 
real-time analysis. 
Keywords: SOA, Industrial Product-Service System, IPS², Architecture, IPS²-

Introduction 
Industrial product-service systems (IPS²) are defined as a bundle of physical products 
and corresponding services for customer oriented solutions [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. 
As an example of this relatively new distribution and business model, imagine an 
agricultural machine is acquired as a service with a guaranteed 95% availability.  
A core feature of IPS² is the mutual determination of product and service compo-
nents along the IPS² lifecycle phases (planning, development, implementation, and 
operation) [2]. In addition, IPS² is characterized by a very high degree of interaction 
between manufacturers, wholesaler, and customer, with a fluctuant intensity of re-
quirement adaptations [7], [3].  
Throughout an IPS² lifecycle, a lot of product and service related data is generated 
from different IT-systems, processes and domains. In classical PLM systems, all of 
this data is gathered and managed only at the manufacturer’s side for internal use 
only, which is not sufficient for IPS². Therefore, a lifecycle management approach for 
IPS² (IPS²-LM) based on the PLM concept has been developed [7]. The classical 
PLM approach has been extended to manage IPS² relevant information, from planning 
through development to recycling phases. Furthermore, the IPS²-LM provides  

486 
M. Abramovici, H.B. Dang, and M. Wolf 
 
domain-specific roles with required information and supports dynamic collaboration 
between IPS² network partners and customers. This IPS²-LM concept is planned to be 
technically implemented in IPS²-KOP (see figure 1). 
 
 
Fig. 1. IPS²-KOP and related key aspects 
This paper will introduce the IPS²-KOP concept as well as relevant technologies 
needed for its implementation.  
The ‘Introduction’ section describes the relationship of the proposed concept and 
related key aspects. Section 2 reviews related work, which is relevant for the devel-
opment of the IPS²-KOP concept. Section 3 gives an overview of basic requirements 
regarding the IPS²-KOP concept. Section 4 describes the IPS²-KOP concept, which is 
based on the SOA paradigm and adapted for IPS². The prototype is described in  
section 5. The last section presents the conclusion and lines of future work.

This section presents an overview of available technologies and current research 
work, and describes the distinction between the new approach and the existing  
solutions. 
2.1 
State of the Art 
A number of PLM vendors recently released web-based PLM solutions like PTC’s 
Windchill 1, AutoDesk’s Autodesk PLM360 2,  Aras’ PLM software 3, Dassault’s 
ENOVIA V6 4, Siemens’ Teamcenter5. All these PLM solutions support engineering 
data, process and project management as well as an online engineering collaboration.

However, these solutions mostly focus on traditional (physical) products and only 
support predefined static processes and activities in product design environments. In 
addition, these PLM solutions are restricted to the use of web service protocols such 
as SOAP6, utilizing UDDI7 and WSDL8, and do not support semantic approaches.  
2.2 
State of Scientific Research 
Service oriented architecture (SOA) already became a widely used design principle in 
industrial PLM solutions (as listed in section 2.1). In contrast, possible extensions of 
SOA with semantic methods are so far still a matter of research. A marketable and 
widely accepted concept remains to be established. In order to distinguish the archi-
tecture introduced in this article from existing approaches to semantic SOA, we short-
ly summarize the current state of research regarding this aspect. 
According to [8], problem solving methods as a core concept of artificial intelli-
gence are the key to enable goal-directed discovery and invocation of services in 
SOA. In the depicted concept, users describe their requirements independent of exist-
ing services; then, these tasks are solved by means of logical reasoning based on the 
semantic description of requirements and services. In comparison to [8], the articles 
[9] and [10] focus mostly on designs and algorithms as well as methods, i.e. the core 
functional SSOA (semantic SOA) tasks of discovery, process mediation and com-
bined discovery and composition. 
Mistry and colleagues [11] add a novel aspect to semantic SOA by introducing a 
new way of improving the quality of service discovery. In the proposed architecture, 
the ontology of service providers is enhanced by analysis and learning from service 
consumer requests, thus rendering the process of service discovery more efficient. 
To summarize, these articles conclude that semantic extensions of SOA are vital to 
enable logical reasoning, which then forms the basis for a complete or partial automa-
tion of service discovery, mediation, composition, and invocation. 
Based on the SOA paradigm, different platforms for the integration of multidiscip-
linary domains have been suggested. In the field of mechatronics, projects such as 
MIKADO [20] and VIVACE [21] as well as research from Bellalouna [18] and El 
Khoury [19], among others, aimed at providing integrated platforms for mechatronic 
product development, which enable interdisciplinary information and systems man-
agement. However, VIVACE focused mostly on simulation and computation; thus, it 
does not offer a truly interdisciplinary platform. Other approaches fulfilled the aspect 
of multidisciplinarity by integrating methods, systems and tools of different domains 
(mechanics, electrical and information engineering). In order to implement these con-
cepts, technologies such as WS-BPEL and STEP have been applied. Although these 
approaches support interdisciplinary domains, they only focus on physical products 
and can therefore not be applied to IPS², as the service component of IPS² cannot be 
represented appropriately.

Besides the projects mentioned above, several web-based PLM-platforms are cur-
rently under development or were recently started. Projects like L.I.S.A., CESAR 
[12] or I-CONIK [13] are incorporating some paradigms on which our approach is 
focused, using service orientation and semantics for improved usability. As these 
projects focus on automotive industry products, they also lack the service-component 
of IPS².

Basic Requirements 
In order to consider all the described specific aspects of IPS² the new Lifecycle Man-
agement platform has to meet the following basic requirements: 
Flexible Metadata Model 
The data kernel of the developed LM platform is a metadata model, which should 
integrate not only product data but all the relevant heterogeneous IPS² data along their 
whole lifecycle. This metadata model should be extended by new classes and attributes 
during the IPS² operation without changing the existing core metadata models. 
Semantic Data Content 
The IPS² lifecycle metadata model should incorporate all the data necessary for know-
ledge-based search, retrieval, analysis or diagnosis operations. For this purpose an 
additional knowledge-based model should be considered within the IPS² lifecycle 
database. Furthermore the knowledge-based model should facilitate the semantic 
integration of heterogeneous data sources. It should provide the user with aggregated 
information, thus forming the basis for intelligent decision support. 
Support of Static and Dynamic Workflows 
Static standard PLM processes like release or change processes have to be supported. 
In addition the new LM platform should consider IPS² specific components. Moreo-
ver the IPS² management should support dynamic processes, which have to be de-
fined and executed in real time, enabling an immediate reaction to unpredicted events 
during the IPS² operation (i.e. changes in the IPS² network). The static and the dy-
namic IPS² workflows should coexist within the IPS² LM platform. 
System Flexibility 
The new IPS² LM-platform has to be hardware independent, portable and integrable 
in order to assure a long term trouble-free operation. Due to unpredictable changes of 
the system environment and of the customers during the IPS² operation, the IT system 
architecture of the IPS² LM platform should be agile and flexible, in order to allow 
the manufacturer and service providers to fulfill their overall contract.

The IPS²-KOP Platform Concept 
Over the last years, the term service-oriented architecture (SOA) has grown to a wide-
ly known symbol of modern software design with a whole lot of advantages to classic 

IPS² Knowledge-Based Service-Oriented Lifecycle Management Platform 
489 
 
approaches when compared to highly dynamic environments. The main motivation of 
using SOA as a design pattern is using functions of different software-providers while 
maintaining a loose coupling between clients and servers and offering platform inde-
pendent services to all the receiving clients [14] to support real-time definition and 
execution of dynamic workflows.  
Considering the described advantages, the IPS²-KOP concept has been developed 
based on SOA, which was extended with an IPS² top domain Ontology and dynamic 
workflow capabilities. This basic platform has been adapted to specific IPS² needs. It 
considers following bottom-up layers (see figure 2):  
External Sources  
The external sources layer contains domain specific applications which provide auto-
matic processing, management and controlling of information and data within their 
special fields, for example PDM, EES, SCM. In our platform concept, these applica-
tions should be considered as a source of IT resources which make their data and 
functions available in encapsulated form (as services) via appropriate interfaces. 
Data Layer 
At the core of this concept are information models, which cover all data models being 
used in the systems and tools deployed in the product life cycle. To solve this task, the 
data layer makes use of an LM metadata model [17] and IPS² top domain ontology. 
The IPS² top domain ontology is used to describe and index a domain of knowledge 
and the relations between its content. The IPS² top domain ontology extended seman-
tically static LM metadata models. At the same time, the IPS² top domain ontology 
integrates heterogeneous data between domain-specific ontologies and systems from 
operative levels (see Figure 2: external sources layer), thus providing the user with 
new semantic information which is based on information stemming from domain-
specific ontologies and generated by predefined rules and axioms. 
Service Layer 
The service layer distinguishes between classical and knowledge-based services. 
Apart from internal services, the functions and data of domain specific applications 
are provided as standardized services within the service layer. Services comprise a 
standard description of application specific functions including the corresponding 
input and output data as well as additional information with regard to the execution 
and usage of the offered functions.  
Workflow Layer 
Within the workflow layer, the defined workflows coordinate and control multiple 
activities across all domain specific applications. The activities use the needed servic-
es from the service layer to perform their tasks. Besides classic workflows, dynamic 
workflows are also incorporated. Dynamic workflow management (described in more 
detail in [15]) is a goal-oriented process management method which aims at replacing 
fixed, sequentially planned processes with dynamic and adaptive ones, thus allowing 
for real-time responses in specific situations. They also provide the process manage-
ment with recommendations for decision making in the view of the further occurring 
process steps.

Prototype 
The prototyping of the IPS²-KOP concept is currently in process. Creation of a whole 
new system for IPS² is time-consuming and unnecessary, as there are commercial 
solutions available which can be extended to fulfill the requirements of the IPS²-KOP 
concept. Using well-tested software like PTC Windchill as a basis for further  
development enables the implementation of new modules of IPS²-KOP and focus on 
refining them. Figure 3 shows an extension of the PLM system Windchill [16] with 
new IPS²-KOP modules and IPS² top domain ontology module. 
Windchill itself offers graphical user interface, certain types of web services and, 
through its Info*Engine, interfaces to several enterprise systems. Because of these 
advantages, the prototype focuses on semantic services and dynamic processes, while 
using the metadata model for IPS². In a first step, the IPS² metadata model has been 
implemented in Windchill, enabling it to manage IPS²-relevant data. In the near fu-
ture, necessary interfaces and the IPS² top domain ontology will be implemented, thus 
supporting knowledge-based methods and services.

Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper introduced a knowledge-based lifecycle management platform for IPS² 
which is based on the principles of SOA. In IPS², involvement of network partners 
and customers across the IPS² lifecycle is one of the most important factors determin-
ing the success of this business model. The proposed IPS²-KOP concept fully  
supports the required intensive collaboration with different business partners and 
customers.  
In order to enable knowledge-based methods (e.g. semantic search, semantic  
information retrieval) and to support dynamic changes of business processes, an IPS² 
top domain ontology has been developed. The ontology includes a semantic descrip-
tion of various IPS² concepts and integrates interdisciplinary information and  
knowledge from different systems.

An additional advantage of the IPS²-KOP concept is its interoperability. While 
proprietary software may yield advantages in a homogenous network, within a hete-
rogeneous network open standards for communication are preferable. 
In near future the presented prototype will be extended with implementations of in-
telligent operations (Knowledge-based Operation: e.g. Change in business model for 
a single customer) utilizing the IPS² top domain ontology and workflows (Dynamic 
Workflow: e.g. Change in supply chain induces adhoc changes in other domains) as 
well as intelligent KPI-based decision support (Knowledge-based Service:  e.g. Eval-
uation of sustainability).

Abstract. The paper presents the results of testing activities aiming to verify the 
effectiveness of an approach that uses color-coded 3D CAD models to visualize 
value in the conceptual design stage of PSS. The paper describes setting and 
findings of a series of PSS Design Experiments involving 8 design teams  
composed by students participating to the Master Programme in Product Devel-
opment. Through the application of protocol analysis to the recorded design 
sessions, the paper compares the behavior of those teams using color-coded 
CAD models, against those using color-coded numerical tables. The design 
teams using color-coded models have been found to dedicate significantly more 
time in the analysis of the value information provided, and to follow a more 
structured approach in problem analysis and solving.

Introduction 
Conceptual Design is one of the most critical steps in the product development 
process [1]. At this stage, designers take decisions that determine a large share of the 
final value of the product [2], often dealing with requirements that are vague, poorly 
defined or not existing. This problem is exacerbated when designing PSS, because the 
design space becomes wider and the analysis of the future solutions goes beyond 
merely product-related characteristics, encompassing service and lifecycle aspects 
outside the horizon of the engineering team [3]. Lacking of a holistic perspective, 
designers tend to follow their ‘normal specification’ and optimize the system locally, 
making decisions based on their own preferences [4]. 
A Stage-Gate® approach [5] is commonly adopted to cope with the issues generat-
ed by long and complex development processes to facilitate projects from idea  
conception to product launch. However, as far as the system grows in complexity, it 
becomes less straightforward to understand which solution is the most value adding. 
Hence decisions at the gate become more difficult and working guidelines during the 
stages less clear. Innovative methods and tools are needed to stimulate the discussion 
about the system-level contribution of a component design, to eventually trigger  

496

better decisions. One of the major issues in this domain relates to the capability of 
representing value-related information in a way to foster such a collaborative process. 
Value-related information relates to the operational life of future design concepts, 
and encompasses dimensions that complement a purely technical and requirements-
related perspective. The literature provides several examples of the multifaceted as-
pects that influence the value of a forthcoming solution. Kowalkowski and Kindström 
[6] represent the value of PSS as the merging of three dimensions: Product, Service 
and Relationship. Declining these dimensions at a lower level of granularity, product-
based value encompasses aspects such as cost and quality, but also environmental 
impact and sustainability [7]. Service-based value encompasses aspects such as opera-
tion cost, customisation benefits, service consistency [6] or ilities [8], capturing for 
instance, by the capability of a system of to maintain its functions in the presence of 
changes. Relationship-based values includes proactivity, trust, long-term commitment 
and shared norms and mind-sets [6], thus encompasses more intangibles aspects, such 
as knowledge, emotions or experiences [9-11]. Building on these concepts, Bertoni et 
al. [12] propose six layers of categorization in an effort to summarize all the aspects 
relevant for the value assessment of a PSS in the aerospace industry, namely: Per-
formance attributes, risk, profitability, operational performances, ilities and intangi-
bles. In a nutshell value-related information can be seen as a way to represent the 
system characteristics, i.e. a way to represent the multifaceted factors and interactions 
which have an impact on the design and the behavior of the product and therefore on 
the design decision-making process 
At the 3rd CIRP IPS2 Conference, the authors presented an approach to support 
decision-making at the gate, by increasing the decision makers’ awareness about the 
value of a set of PSS alternatives [13]. The paper proposed an approach for displaying 
the value contribution of a part/assembly through color-coded 3D models in a CAD 
environment, which were exemplified in a case study related to the development of an 
aero-engine sub-system. The models aimed at improving the design teams’ awareness 
on the problem to be solved, leveraging the way value-related information was consi-
dered during conceptual design.  
This paper presents the results of a testing activity performed to verify such hypo-
thesis. The researchers have applied protocol analysis to evaluate the performances of 
eight design teams working on the same design task, four using value reports in the 
form of color-coded 3D models, and four using value reports in the form of color-
coded QFD-like tables. Eventually, conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of 
the proposed visualization approach for PSS design.

Research Method  
The research has been conducted within a European Commission’s Seventh Frame-
work Programme (FP7) project named CRESCENDO (Collaborative and Robust 
Engineering using Simulation Capability Enabling Next Design Optimisation – 
http://www.crescendo-fp7.eu/) between May 2009 and October 2012.

The research adopts protocol analysis, in the form of Gero and Mc Neill [14], to 
investigate the behaviors of the designers during the design episodes. Protocol analy-
sis has its roots in the “think aloud” method, which was introduced by Ericsson and 
Simon [15] and further detailed by van Someren et al. [16], where designers are liter-
ally asked to think aloud, so to record the verbalization for later analysis. The protocol 
technique extends the think aloud method through the use of a domain-dependent 
coding scheme based on generic models of designing and a robust coding methodolo-
gy [14]. This approach makes possible to observe the temporal aspect of the design 
process [17] and to capture designers’ behaviors as a sequence of activities. 
Protocol Analysis considers the designer's activity as composed by a sequence of 
actions, each typically lasting for a few seconds. During the course of the work, de-
signers engage in the design problem calling up a series of micro strategies, which can 
be recorded, grouped, categorized and analyzed [6]. The testing activity has been 
conducted in a laboratory environment involving students from a second year master 
in mechanical engineering.

PSS Dimensions for Conceptual Design 
The PSS dimensions have been defined emerging from the PSS Layer method first 
developed by Müller et al. [18], and later adopted by Sakao [19]. The method defines 
nine dimensions, namely: Lifecycle activities, Needs, Values, Deliverables, Actors, 
Core Products, Periphery, Contract and Finance. Such layers served as a guidance to 
define a set of PSS dimension to be used in the protocol analysis. Within the present 
study, 5 of the original dimensions were better defined and renamed in order to avoid 
inconsistencies and to limit the risk of mistaken interpretation by the encoders.  
Namely Deliverables and Customer Value were reworked into Usage Phase and Ser-
vice, to detail how the design teams intend to deliver value, either by directly impact-
ing the usage phase of the product or by creating synergies or benefits in the servicing 
activities. Core Product was reworked into Engineering Characteristics, to better cap-
ture hardware-related instances, making explicit that this dimension was limited to 
technical specification. Eventually, Knowledge Reuse and Design Rationale were 
added and Actors and Contract removed, to analyze the impact of the visualization 
approach on the use of knowledge in PSS conceptual design, where discussions about 
contract specifications are premature and actors involved are not yet defined. The 9 
PSS dimensions used for the analysis are defined as follows: 
• Needs captures the discussion related to the definition or clarification of customers’ 
and stakeholders’ needs. It also considers the discussion related to the information 
made available from the previous assessment, as it represents a way to clarify the 
needs of the forthcoming solution. (e.g.: ‘…yes, but what is the need we focus on 
when we want it inside?...´) 
• Knowledge Reuse captures the discussion related to the personal knowledge of the 
designers that was recalled during the experiment in order to fulfill the design task. 
(e.g.: ´The plastic may melt if you put something on it, so I think is not the best´) 

498 
A. Bertoni and M. Bertoni 
 
• Design Rationale refers to explicit documentation, discussions, argumentations or 
reasons behind decisions made when designing a system or artifact. (e.g.: ´Why 
was it better with plastic?´) 
• Engineering Characteristics captures the discussion related to the structure, me-
chanical characteristics, technical features or material related to the PSS hardware. 
(e.g.: ´…if we take away the welding and try to make it more…´) 
• Usage Phase includes all the statements related to the operating phase of the prod-
uct when the customer is physically using the artifact. (e.g. ´If you look at what is 
here, if you talk about ergonomics, it should be easier to use´) 
• Service embeds all those statements related to activities activated by the customer’s 
request to benefit of the product, but that are not directly visible by the customers, 
such as transportation or in-site assembly. (e.g.: ´It would take a lot of less time in-
stead of pushing it into the garden…´) 
• Lifecycle Activities contains all those statements related to the lifecycle of the 
product, from the production to the dismissal, with the exception of the statements 
concerning Usage Phase and Service. (e.g.: ´We can have a foldable one that is 
easier to store, but then is harder to assemble´) 
• Periphery captures the statements about support equipment, technical periphery, 
tools and infrastructure related to the PSS execution system, similarly to what de-
fined by Muller et al. [18]. (e.g.: ´I am thinking not roll it into the truck, but having 
a small crane that can..´) 
• Finance includes all the discussions about cost-related aspects, either related to 
production, maintenance or servicing of the PSS. (e.g. ´Perhaps the burners are the 
most expensive part, those ones…´) 
To facilitate the analysis at an higher level of granularity, the dimensions have also 
been grouped based on their area of relevance: Knowledge Reuse and Design Ratio-
nale referred to the Knowledge field, while Lifecycle Activities, Usage Phase, Peri-
phery and Service have been grouped into the Service System field. The grouped 
categories are those not considered as main evaluation metrics for the experiment, and 
the decision to group them is driven by the necessity to make the result more reada-
ble. A description of the key metrics of the experiment is provided in section 4.3.

Experiment Set-Up 
The testing activity was conducted in a laboratory environment at the university fa-
cilities. The rooms during all the experiments were equipped with the same material, 
i.e., papers, pencils, pens, tape and prototyping materials; the walls of the rooms were 
empty and no whiteboards were available. The equipment for both audio and video 
recording were available at DO. Eight experiments, in four different sessions took 
place between January and February 2012. A pilot session also took place in Decem-
ber 2011 and served the purpose of verifying and adjusting the variables for the study. 
All the sessions featured the same schedule. The task was explained in a 20 minutes 
meeting where the company, its PSS offer, and the rating system for the value as-
sessment were presented. Each design team had then 25 minutes to analyze the report 

 
Effectiveness of Color-Coded CAD Models Value Visualization 
499 
 
and come up with a new design. Additional 15 minutes were given to prototype a 
solution to be later presented to the other groups. The presentations lasted for 10 mi-
nutes, including short question and answer sessions. The last 15 minutes were spent to 
fill in individual questionnaires focusing on the use of the value assessment report. 
The analysis in this study has been limited to the problem analysis and idea genera-
tion phase (25 minutes). 
4.1 
Assignment and Instructions 
The experiment featured a fictional design problem, which considered a barbeque 
equipment manufacturer aiming to shift its business focus, from selling the equipment 
through its retail network to provide it as a PSS solution. Despite the approach being 
first developed in the aerospace industry [13], it was preferred not to use the example 
of an aerospace component, since students might have perceived it as too complex 
and difficult to related to their direct knowledge. In the new scenario the ownership of 
the product stays with the manufacturer, which has to take care of all the service-
related aspects, e.g. maintenance, cleaning, delivery and storage. The participants 
were asked to redesign the grills to make them more value adding in a situation where 
they are rented and delivered “just in time” to the customer.  
The design sessions involved 26 students, who were split in 8 design teams of ei-
ther 3 or 4 persons. The participants were allocated randomly to the teams with the 
only concern to uniformly assign the international students in order to use English as 
the only language. No particular method for PSS design was taught to the students 
prior to the experiments, in order not to influence the design session. Information 
about the company previous products was available to all the participants. Especially 
two different designs were described: The “old BBQ solution” (the old, outdated de-
sign) and “the actual BBQ solution” (the As-Is design). The two solutions had a simi-
lar structure based on six main components: A frame, a case, a grill, a lid, two  
supports, and a gas cylinder. The actual BBQ solution differed from the old one in 
terms of shape, materials and components, as it also featured an air system. 
The value assessment reports, distributed to all the teams, represented the “know-
ledge baseline” for the redesign activity. The reports contained information about the 
capability of the old and actual design to fulfill the customer value scale, providing 
value-related information to the designers. The old and As-Is designs were compared 
against a set of value dimensions and value drivers, which were intended to translate 
stakeholders expectations and needs into understandable and actionable design objec-
tives. Five value dimensions were defined, each of them built up by two to five  
specific value drivers. The 5 value dimensions were defined as: Operational Perfor-
mances (i.e. Warming speed, Cooling speed, Ergonomics, Heat distribution, Safety), 
Service (i.e. Reparability, Cleaning, Mean time between failure, Assembly time, Lo-
gistic (i.e. Packaging, Weight, Size, Foldability), Production costs (i.e. Material cost, 
Manufacturing cost, Assembly cost), Intangibles (i.e. Brand acknowledgement, Envi-
ronmental impact). In total six papers in an A3 format were provided in each report. 
Each paper reported the results of the benchmarking of a specific value dimension

with its related value drivers, while the sixth paper reported an aggregate view of the 
5 value dimensions without the detailed value drivers.  
4.2 
Implementing the Visualization Approach in the Design Problem Scenario 
The value contribution of the ´Actual BBQ’ was assessed by the authors using the 
same 1-9 scale proposed by the value visualization approach [5], considering the ‘Old 
BBQ’ as baseline. In case the ´Actual BBQ´ was found more value adding than the 
old solution for a given driver, a score form 6 to 9 was assigned. In the opposite case 
a score between 1 and 4 was assigned. A score of 5 meant that no difference was 
found between the old and the As-Is solution. A color scale from red to white to dark 
green was associated to the numerical scale. White was associated to the neutral value 
(5), nuances of red to scores from 1 to 4 (pink=4, red=1), nuances of green to scores 
from 6 to 9 (light green=6, dark green=9).  
Fig. 1. Color-coded tables vs. color-coded 3D models 
The value assessment report featured two alternative visualizations (Figure 1). 
Four teams received value-related information in a QFD-like format, i.e. the results of 
the benchmarking were visualized as numbers from one to nine in an excel table, and 
each table cell was filled with the corresponding color. The other 4 teams received the 
value assessment results as color-coded 3D models. In this case the report did not 
show any number, but the benchmark information were directly visualized as compo-
nents colors in the printout of the BBQ CAD model. To avoid bias during the experi-
ments the students were not aware of the difference in the value visualization between 
the teams.

Evaluation Metrics 
The shift toward the design of PSS forces designers to make decisions based on a 
wider set of customer and stakeholder needs and expectation [20]. Being able to iden-
tify such needs earlier at a conceptual stage would save time and rework in later phas-
es of the development process [20]. Therefore the author identified in the increase of 
the total time spent on discussing needs a success criterion for the evaluation of the 
visualization approach. Moreover research has shown that when a sample design is 
available to designers, the range of ideas produced in a conceptual design session 
suffers by design fixation [21]. Building on this finding, the discussion of specific 
engineering characteristics of the future products in the very initial phase of a concep-
tual design was considered as a proxy to evaluate the early fixation on a specific pre-
formed idea of product to be developed, making designers’ scarcely considering the 
new aspects related to the service dimension. By consequence the decrease of the total 
time spent in discussing engineering characteristics in the first quarter of the experi-
ments has been identified as a success criterion to be investigated.

Data Analysis 
The experiments were transcribed and codified separately by two encoders. This was 
done to grant the coding consistency. The percentage of agreement between the en-
coders after the first round of coding was of 65.2%.  This result showed the necessity 
of describing with major detail the definition of the PSS dimensions into considera-
tion. A second coding activity was later performed jointly by the two encoders, which 
led to the final version of the coding presented in the paper. 
The scheduled duration for the idea generation and report analysis phase was of 25 
minutes, however small discrepancies, up to 2-3 minutes, were found during the tran-
scription. To overcome this problem the time spent on each PSS dimension has not 
been considered in absolute terms, but has been translated into percentage of the total 
time spent in the experiment. 
5.1 
High Level Results 
Initially, the analysis has focused on the total time spent on each dimension during the 
experiment. The first column of Table 1 lists the 9 PSS dimensions considered for the 
analysis, plus an additional dimension that gathers all those statements that were not 
related to any dimension. The second column shows the average time percentage 
spent on each dimension by the teams with QFD-like value reports. The third column 
shows the average time percentage spent on each dimension by the teams with color-
coded CAD models. Finally the last column shows the difference between column 2 
and column 3.

Table 1 shows a relevant change in the behavior of the design teams. The teams us-
ing color-coded CAD models have spent 12% more of the total time in discussing 
about clarification and definition of needs, also related to the analysis of the previous 
value related information. This behavior causes the reduction of the time spent on all 
the other PSS dimensions with the only exception of the Service dimension, which 
has been discussed for the 2.44% more of the total time. 
The analysis at this stage did not suggest the reasons for such behavior, neither it 
allowed analyzing in detail the behavior and the trends generated by the difference in 
the visualization. Therefore a second step of the analysis focused on the evolution of 
the topic of the discussion along the timeline of the session. 
5.2 
Analysis along Experiments Timeframe 
To analyze in which sequence different activities were undertaken during the ses-
sions, the experiments were temporally divided in four quarters. Each quarter lasted 
from 5 to 7 minutes according to the length of the experiment. It is worth notice that 
the time not allocated to any PSS dimension did not differ much between the two 
categories (see Table 1). For this reason such percentage of time were not considered 
in the analysis that follows. 
Figure 2 displays the results of the analysis along the 4 quarters of the experiment, 
and shows that the teams using color-coded models initially approached the design 
problem strongly analyzing the needs (more that 50% of the time). As opposite teams 
with tabular reports dedicated to this task less that 15% of their time, focusing more 
on the engineering characteristics of the new product to develop. Concerning Finance 
and Knowledge no significant difference was found, while the aspects related to the 
Service System were deeper discussed by subjects with tables. The same trend related

Fig. 2. Length (in percentage) of the time spent on each PSS dimension along the timeline 
to the Service System was visible in the second quarter, where no relevant difference 
in behavior for teams with tables is recognized. CAD models teams instead switched 
their focus, reducing the time dedicated to investigate needs and spending an increas-
ing time for Knowledge and Engineering Characteristics. In the third quarter a slightly 
increase in the Knowledge dimension for the teams with tables is visible, together 
with a continuous increase in the Engineering Characteristics dimension for the CAD 
model teams. In this quarter the teams with color-coded models started to significant-
ly discuss Service System with more intensity. Finally in the last quarter the CAD 
models teams mainly focus on Service System and Engineering Characteristics, while 
the teams dealing with tabular reports did not show any significant change from the 
3rd quarter. It has to be noted that after the first quarter, designers with color-coded 
models did not abandon the discussion about the needs, but kept focus on this dimen-
sion, conserving a percentage higher than the teams with tabular visualization all 
along the experiment.

Discussion  
The results of the tests indicate that the use of color-coded CAD models drive the 
design team in a more detailed discussion of the needs of the solution to be devel-
oped. This finding is particularly relevant since the dimension Needs covers all the 
discussions related to the value assessment reports made available to the design team. 
Such finding strengths the hypothesis that the value visualization approach in color-
coded CAD models enhances the awareness about the problem to be solved, leverag-
ing the way value-related information is used in conceptual design. 
From the analysis of the discussion along the timeline a clear trend seems to 
emerge. Teams using tabular reports did not significantly change their behavior dur-
ing the experiment, i.e. the time spent on the PSS dimensions did not differ signifi-
cantly in the quarters. As opposite teams with color-coded CAD reports followed a 

504 
A. Bertoni and M. Bertoni 
 
more structured approach. Initially they focus on the needs, and then they recalled 
previous knowledge and rationale to feed the discussion about the engineering charac-
teristics of the hardware. In the third quarter the Service System dimension was em-
phasized concurrently to the technical discussion about engineering characteristics. 
The process is completed by the fourth quarter when the discussion about the Service 
Systems was brought up to more than 30%, equalizing those related to the engineer-
ing characteristics.  
6.1 
Discussion about the Method 
The experiments have featured 26 participants from the Master Programme in Product 
Development. Protocol analysis is a widely know and proven approach, and despite 
some limitation [22] and the limited set of data, previous studies have shown the me-
thod to be applied also for a smaller number of experiments (see [19]).  In authors’ 
advice the sample represents the target population for the visualization approach, as 
they are soon becoming novice engineers in industry, and they will be actively in-
volved in development projects featuring similar boundary conditions (intensity of 
teamwork, limitations in the knowledge baseline, deadlines) and problem statements. 
In terms of possibility of observing similar results in an industrial context, as hig-
hlighted by Coley [23], the main difference between experts and novices is that  
experts pay frequent attention to the reformulation of the problem, while this is com-
pletely ignored by the novices [24], which have been found to use a pattern of trial 
and error [25] although they seem to use similar working backward strategies [26]. 
These suggest that the results in an industrial contest might differ in absolute terms 
from what observed in the artificial scenario, although in relative terms the difference 
between the two settings might not be particularly evident. Furthermore, as recog-
nized in the information visualization literature, most information visualization tools 
are still verified and validated in lab settings [27]. In spite of the drawbacks of artifi-
cial scenarios [28], a main advantage of conducting experiments with students in a 
laboratory environment is that industrial companies may not permit video and audio 
recording, and this restricts the amount and relevancy of the data collected.

Conclusion 
The paper has presented the results of a set of experiments run in a laboratory envi-
ronment aiming at analyzing the impact of color-coded 3D CAD models to improve 
communication and value-related information processing in PSS conceptual design.  
The experiments have shown that design teams using such models have spent sig-
nificantly more time, compared to teams using color-coded tabular reports, on analyz-
ing the needs of the new solution in the light of the value information communicated 
to the design teams. Additionally the teams with color-coded CAD models have fol-
lowed a more structured approach in analyzing the multifaceted aspects of the design 
problem into consideration. The experiments thereby confirm the hypothesis that 
color-coded 3D CAD visualization enhances the awareness of design teams on the

problem to be solved, leveraging the way value-related information are used during 
conceptual design. Such finding suggests that the use of color coded CAD models to 
visualize the value of a forthcoming solution would improve the stage-gate process 
during early design, by triggering better decisions thanks to an improved understand-
ing of the system level contribution of a component design. 
Future work will focus on new codification of the existing recordings after the se-
lection of categories targeting different aspects of the design activity. Finally addi-
tional experiments will be planned involving a larger number of product stakeholders 
and featuring cross-functional teams with different backgrounds.

Abstract. To support the Industrial Product-Service System (IPS²) provider 
during the delivery phase of IPS², an IPS²-Execution System (IPS²-ES) is 
needed for the planning, scheduling and organization of the required delivery 
processes and the partner network. To be able to build such an IPS²-ES, the  
requirements for this system have to be collected in a user specification docu-
ment. Based on the given requirements, a functional specification has to be  
developed to serve as a basis for the design and the architecture of an IPS²-ES. 
In this paper, an overview over a functional specification for an IPS²-ES is 
given. Since the requirements for the development of software systems for ac-
tive collaborative research projects are continuously changing due to new re-
sults from own research or related projects, the agile software development 
process is proposed for the implementation of an IPS²-ES prototype. 
Keywords: Industrial Product-Service System, IPS²-Execution System, func-
tional specification.

Introduction 
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) are means to provide customer value as, for 
example, described in [1] and [2]. This customer value is achieved by not only selling 
a product and offering services to a customer but by offering a system that integrates 
product and service shares. An integrated development of these two parts of the sys-
tem as well as their mutually determined planning and delivery allow for the fulfill-
ment of the customer needs [3]. 
The delivery of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) is a highly complex task. 
An IPS² provider has to take several responsibilities to provide the value agreed upon 
with an IPS² customer. In [4] the responsibilities are described and a system for sup-
porting the provider in the delivery of IPS² is proposed. This system has to be able to 
manage fluctuations in a supplier network, provide strategic and operational planning 
methods, serve information about the IPS² delivery to all IPS² partners, and much 
more. The different software systems currently available on the market, among them 
Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP), Manufacturing Execution Systems 
(MES) and Service Management Systems (SMS), do not provide the features to sup-
port an IPS² provider in his specific tasks. Therefore, a new system called IPS²-
Execution System is proposed. [4] 

508 
H. Meier, F. Morlock, and T. Dorka 
Although [4] already describes parts of the functionality of a so-called IPS²-
Execution System (IPS²-ES), a formal specification to serve as a basis for the devel-
opment of such a system is not given therein. Therefore, a user specification for an 
IPS²-ES is presented in this paper. Based on that, a functional specification is devel-
oped to serve as a basis for an implementation of the IPS²-ES. 
2 
State of the Art 
For the development of an IPS²-Execution System, a specification document for the 
system has to be created to lay out the conditions for the implementation. According 
to [5], such a document is called “user specification” (this term will be used through-
out this paper). However, the term is not used consistently in the corresponding  
literature. In [6] the document is named “tender specification”, [7] refers to “system 
requirements” and [8] uses “Stakeholder Requirements Definition” and “system tech-
nical requirements” for the same document. The process of creating such a specifica-
tion is called requirements engineering, as, for example, presented in [9] or [6]. 
[7] and [10] further detail the contents of the specification as: introduction to the 
project, description of the starting point (current status), tasks (desired status), inter-
faces, system technology requirements, requirements for starting up and operation, 
quality requirements and project execution requirements. 
Each requirement represents a necessary attribute of the described system that is of 
value and utility to a customer or user. The attributes can describe capabilities, char-
acteristics or quality factors. This provides the basis for the following development 
work. [9] 
[9] and [11] distinguish several types of requirements. [9] first distinguishes be-
tween hardware and software requirements. Both are further detailed. The software 
requirements, which are most important for this paper, are divided into functional 
requirements and non-functional requirements. Also, the suggestions presented in [8] 
are referenced. 
[11] presents a tree of classifications for requirements. Type, content, scope, detail 
level, reference point and many more are presented. The type classification also con-
tains the functional and non-functional aspects in addition to the restriction of the 
solution space and domain requirements. 
As a summary, the user specification describes what has to be done to develop the 
system and what purpose the system serves [6]. The requirements mentioned in the 
specification can be classified by different characteristics, e.g. describing functional 
or non-functional aspects of the system. 
Based on the user specification, a technical implementation proposal document can 
be developed. This document is named functional specification (this term will be used 
throughout the paper) in [5]. [6] and [10] use the term performance specification 
while [7] just uses specification. In addition to the reviewed and extended contents of 
the user specification, the functional specification adds the system solution and the 
system technology (see [10] and [7]). 

 
Functional Specification for IPS²-Execution Systems 
509 
To be able to create a functional specification, the requirements given in the user 
specification have to fulfil several criteria as given in [9]. For example, each require-
ment should be correct, complete, consistent and feasible. 
The functional specification describes how and with what (e.g. measures, tools, 
functionality, etc.) each requirement will be realized. The document is then used as a 
contractual description of the scope of the delivery and serves as a basis for the reali-
zation and preliminary and final inspections. [6] 
3 
User Specification for an IPS²-Execution System 
As mentioned above, a user specification contains the following parts: introduction to 
the project, description of the starting point (current status), tasks (desired status), 
interfaces, system technology requirements, requirements for starting up and opera-
tion, quality requirements and project execution requirements. While an introduction 
to the IPS²-ES is given in [12] and [4], [13] elaborates on the role of the IPS²-ES in 
control of IPS². These papers can serve as an introduction to the project and the topics 
therein will not be repeated here. 
The starting point for the development of an IPS²-ES is the research conducted on 
special topics of the IPS², for example on capacity planning [14], [15], adaptive  
resource planning [16], [17] and organizations for IPS² [18], [19]. Based on the  
information provided there and in [4], the tasks and interfaces as well as system tech-
nology, operation and quality requirements can be derived. 
Since the required space for a detailed description of all requirements is not given 
in this paper, the requirements, including the necessary interfaces and tasks, will be 
presented only with a short description and references. 
1) Technical Interfaces. This section describes the interfaces to external systems for 
sending and receiving different data or for using services. 
A Life Cycle Management System (LCMS) for IPS² is the main source of informa-
tion for the IPS²-ES. It supplies all information that is needed for the delivery of the 
IPS². Among those are descriptions of delivery processes, including their require-
ments, as well as the partner network involved in the delivery. [20], [21], [22] 
The IPS²-Control System (IPS²-CS) controls each delivery process and reports un-
planned demands to the IPS²-ES. It depends on the master plan created by the IPS²-ES 
and tracks all processes, supports workers in fulfilling the delivery process and moni-
tors the IPS² condition. Hence, an interface to the IPS²-CS has to be implemented. 
Transmission of data should be done via the LCMS while the incoming data should 
be received directly from the IPS²-CS due to the real-time requirement 6.3. [13] 
An interface to the Knowledge Management System (KMS) for IPS² should be es-
tablished to retrieve past data, e.g. about previously executed delivery processes, and 
achieve continuous improvement of the IPS²-ES (see requirement 3). [23] 
Each partner in the delivery network for an IPS² has potentially a software system 
to support his business. For example, this can be an ERP system to track the availabil-
ity of offered products, an SMS that tracks the availability of service technicians or an 

510 
H. Meier, F. Morlock, and T. Dorka 
MES that keeps the information of machine (potentially IPS²) availability. This data is 
needed for the planning of IPS². Therefore, an interface to these business software 
systems needs to be created. Although several suppliers of these software systems are 
available and the software systems have different interface capabilities, a common inter-
face to the IPS²-ES should be created to collect necessary data. [18], [24], [25], [4] 
During the delivery of an IPS², several external services have to be used. Among 
these are the ordering of spare parts and the transportation of goods. In the IPS²-ES, 
the use of such services should be included in the planning. Therefore, an automated 
process for ordering spare parts or scheduling logistics over web services has to be 
integrated. [4] 
2) Planning Method for IPS². This section describes the requirements for the IPS² 
planning methods needed for the delivery of IPS² in a distributed partner network. 
Since the IPS² planning methods are very complex, an appropriate data model 
should be created to serve both as the model for the planning algorithm as well as the 
data exchange format with external business software systems. Only the necessary 
data for the IPS²-ES should be contained to avoid redundant data storage. [14], [4] 
Strategic capacity planning is needed to support an IPS² provider in the determina-
tion of how many resources he needs in the future for the delivery of all IPS² he pro-
vides. This includes spare parts, tools and service technicians. Since not all resources 
are supplied by the IPS² provider, the data of external partners has to be included. The 
planning method should be based on the following literature: [16], [14], [15], [17] 
Operational resource planning is needed whenever an unplanned demand occurs 
on short notice. The available resources have to be used to fulfil the unplanned de-
mand without substantially affecting the already planned demands. The planning 
method should be based on the following literature: [16] 
For the planning of IPS², several resources of different network partners, including 
the customers, are used to fulfil the demands of each IPS². Whenever capacity of one 
of the resources is low, a new network partner can be integrated in the network to 
supply the needed resources. Depending on the resulting network configuration, the 
IPS²-ES should self-configure itself to use the newly available partners and change the 
delivery plan accordingly. For example, the integration of a provider of logistic ser-
vices that are fast and offered at a favourable price can have a considerable impact on 
costing factors of a delivery plan. [4] 
External services should be used for planning algorithm, if available. For the calcu-
lation of the travel times of service technicians, travel route planning services (e.g. 
Google Maps API) should be used to provide most accurate details for the planning 
phase. Also, a possibility to integrate web services of providers of logistic services 
should be created. [26], [27] 
3) High System Effect Performance. This section describes the system effect per-
formance requirements for an IPS²-ES. A high system effect performance of the IPS²-
ES is achieved, when the delivery of the IPS² is executed with optimized parameters 
like low costs, punctuality of delivery or a balanced utilization of resources. Due to 
the changes in the several different input parameters for the IPS²-ES, e.g. changed 

 
Functional Specification for IPS²-Execution Systems 
511 
product models, different sets of resources, etc., a continuous improvement process 
has to be established. 
To be able to measure the performance of the system, appropriate measurement 
techniques for the different parts of the application have to be implemented. This 
includes the measurement of partner performance, i.e. how good and how quick a 
partner fulfills the tasks (e.g. production, service, logistics) assigned to him, and mea-
suring the quality of the delivery plan created by the planning algorithm, taking into 
account how long it has taken to generate the plan. Also, software metrics should be 
included, if necessary. This requirement is not final, since the effect parameters can 
only be derived from the IPS²-ES when it is built. The data acquired by the perfor-
mance measurement should be provided to a KMS. Already available knowledge data 
should be used throughout the system to improve the performance. [23] 
4) Web-Based Graphical User Interface. For the interaction of users via IPS²-ES, a 
web-based graphical user interface is required. The advantage of using a web-based 
user interface is that the application does not need to be installed on the client but is 
available independently of the user device. The client is provided with a  configura-
ble user interface where a user can define which parts of the application he wants to 
see and which services he wants to use (provided he has the required role, see re-
quirement 6). Additionally, the IPS²-ES should provide a control center to manage the 
internal elements of the software system, including the adding of services and  
partners. 
5) Information Provision. Throughout the delivery of the IPS², information has to be 
provided to the users of the system and to workers executing the delivery processes as 
planned by the IPS²-ES. The unhindered flow of data and the easy access to the sys-
tem should be provided. 
The LCMS provides detailed data about the IPS² product model including its deli-
very processes, spare parts and tools as well as information about the IPS² network 
partners. For each of the participants in a delivery process (e.g. a service technician or 
a delivery man), specific data has to be provided, e.g. about the delivery process or 
used spare parts and tools. This data can be retrieved from the LCMS and can contain, 
among others, technical data or process plans. With this, the IPS²-ES can help to  
prepare for each delivery process. On the other hand, the IPS²-ES should provide an 
aggregated view over the IPS² for each of the customers. This is realized by the web-
based user interface presented in requirement 4). [4] 
To allow for an information flow for participants of an IPS² delivery process, a 
communication platform should be established. Beyond the data provided in require-
ment 5), participants can use the platform for task-based information exchange and 
coordination. Also, customers of IPS² can get into contact with the IPS² provider if 
they need to clarify topics about the delivery plan for their IPS². This especially sup-
ports the socio-technical aspect of the IPS². [4]

6) Non-functional Requirements. This section describes the non-functional require-
ments for the IPS²-ES, i.e. they target the system as a whole, not only the functionali-
ty provided by the system. [11] 
The availability of the IPS²-ES has to be as high as possible. If the system breaks 
down, planning functionality and information exchange for delivery processes, both 
crucial parts of the IPS²-ES, cannot be used anymore, which will have a great impact 
on the delivery of the whole IPS². An architecture allowing for failover should be 
targeted. A cloud computing solution could offer this functionality. [12] 
Due to the heterogeneity of the user group, the system should be as self-explaining 
as possible and provide high usability. Trained IPS² managers should be able to re-
trieve their special data while untrained users can easily work occasionally with the 
system. Using a manual should be the last resort to help in using the system. An on-
line help function that refers to the part of the system the user is working with should 
provide answers to urgent questions. Easy-to-understand labels, simple graphics and a 
consistent look should make it simple to adapt to. Depending on the user group, the 
different parts of the system may require more or less understanding of the IPS²-ES. 
The design process should be guided by software ergonomic standards. [28] 
Due to the fact that the IPS²-ES is part of a large-scale complex system, it has to be 
able to react in a certain timeframe to allow for control of the whole IPS² in the deli-
very and use phase. This real-time constraint, however, does not have a fixed time 
horizon. Depending on the urgency of unplanned demands, the requirement is that the 
system provides a viable solution in an adequate time. The definition of the concrete 
real-time requirements will be based on the first planning prototype. [29], [13], [30] 
Several platforms for the hosting of applications are available. To be independent 
of a specific supplier, the IPS²-ES should be platform-independent. This means, it 
should be possible to install the software on all major server platforms, including 
cloud environments and physical standalone servers. Also, the installation require-
ments should be very low so that the IPS²-ES can be moved from one platform to 
another without high effort during the prototype phase. If possible, the installation 
requirements should be none and the client side should be browser-independent. [12] 
Two key factors of the IPS² are the openness and the extensibility of the system. 
Both allow for an easy integration of new IPS² partners and new web service provid-
ers, e.g. for logistics or order processes. New services, new functionality and new 
partners should be integrated into the system automatically and existing services 
should be able to self-configure their behavior according to the set of available service 
offerings. [4] 
The maintenance efforts for the system should be kept at a minimum. Since the 
system itself is highly automatic, manual intervention should be avoided, if possible. 
Newer versions of services should be automatically integrated as required in 6.5. Er-
rors should be reported to the responsible person with the place of its occurrence and 
the state the software was in at the moment the error occurred. To reduce errors and 
bugs, unit tests for the system should be implemented. 
The visibility of data should be restricted according to different user roles to pro-
vide security. IPS² customers may only see the data connected with their IPS² and 
service technicians or delivery men may only see the information required for the 

 
Functional Specification for IPS²-Execution Systems 
513 
execution of their task in the delivery process. By doing this, the know-how from 
different partners is protected. If possible, data should be handled anonymously. The 
three levels of visibility presented in [4] should be taken into account. 
7) Documentation. This section describes the requirements for the documentation of 
the IPS²-ES. 
As general documentation for developers, the code has to be written in a readable 
style. Unit tests should allow for an understanding of what every part of the system is 
meant to do. Where needed or appropriate, additional comments should be given in 
the code itself and in the unit tests. A guide should give an overview over the general 
system architecture. For users, context-sensitive online help should be made available. 
For administrators, an installation and configuration guide should be available. For 
the developers of new services and for new IPS² partners, a guide with principles for 
the integration of services into the IPS²-ES should be made available. This document 
should be created during the development of the prototype. Best practices and the 
most common errors should be collected there and serve as a reference for future 
development. 
4 
Functional Specification for an IPS²-Execution System 
Based on the user specification, a functional specification can be created. The given 
requirements in the user specification have to be fulfilled by the proposals of the func-
tional specification. The following section will describe guidelines for the implemen-
tation of an IPS²-ES to fulfil the given requirements. A solution approach for each 
requirement is presented below. 
1) Technical Interfaces. The interface to the LCMS will be implemented via web 
services. New delivery plans are transmitted to the LCMS directly after they have 
been created and required data is retrieved from the system whenever needed. An 
observer pattern will be implemented for notifications from the LCMS about new 
IPS² product models or change in the partner network. In addition to that, the IPS²-CS 
will be connected directly as required by implementing the interface proposed in [13]. 
To connect to the partners’ business software system, an intermediate layer will be 
introduced. Each business partner will be represented in the IPS²-ES as a virtual  
organization unit (VOU) that provides the required data. The mechanism for transfer-
ring the data from and to the external system is encapsulated in the unit, depending on 
whatever interface the partners’ software systems require. Hence, the organizational 
structure presented in [18] will be implemented in the IPS²-ES and a visualization of 
the organization can later be implemented. External services will be represented in-
side the IPS² with a thin wrapper layer to allow consistent communication inside the 
IPS² while hiding service implementation detail. 
2) Planning Method for IPS². The planning method proposed in [16] will be adopted 
for the IPS²-ES. If it is required, some aspects of the algorithm will be altered, e.g. to 

514 
H. Meier, F. Morlock, and T. Dorka 
use available data from generated knowledge. The implementation of VOU as men-
tioned above will serve as a basis for the self-configuration. All data from the VOU 
will be made available to the planning algorithm by implementing a plug-in frame-
work that makes services and therefore the business software systems of the partners 
available as soon as they are added to the system (e.g. with a framework like [31]). A 
data model will be developed together with the planning algorithm in an incremental 
approach. [14] already provides an approach for a data model, which will serve as a 
guideline. 
3) High System Effect Performance. A performance measurement method for the 
IPS²-ES will be developed. Software metrics and key performance indicators will be 
reviewed in order to find the set of parameters that have an impact on the IPS² deli-
very. Rating data for IPS² partners and their resources will be generated by means of 
the KMS. This data can later be used to optimize the delivery plan by the use of high-
ly rated partners and resources. 
4) Web-Based Graphical User Interface. For the application’s portability (see re-
quirement 6) and browser independence, the asynchronous web application frame-
work Google Web Toolkit (GWT, [32]) will be used. With this framework, several 
web applications (called WApps in the IPS²-ES) will be created, each with a separate 
concern. An additional web application will be developed to serve as a user desktop, 
which is similar to the operating system of a state-of-the-art smartphone. Using this 
desktop WApp as their entry point into the system, the user can define his own set of 
applications to build his own distinct view on the IPS²-ES. The set of available 
WApps for each user is restricted by the roles assigned to him. The loose coupling of 
the WApps and the separation of concerns allows an exchange of single parts of the 
IPS²-ES without having to change the system as a whole. Each WApp will be de-
signed for browser independence. 
5) Information Provision. A WApp will be built which supports both the provision 
of required data from the LCMS as well as the communication of the parties involved 
in a delivery process. Each user of the WApp can automatically see all the delivery 
processes assigned to him, ordered chronologically, and can then select one of the 
processes. For each process, the available data can be retrieved from the LCMS. Part-
ners involved in a delivery process can also exchange data and messages (with sup-
port of asynchronous messaging) through this WApp. Inside the WApp, partners will 
be automatically linked based on common delivery processes. 
6) Non-functional Requirements. Usability will be taken into account while design-
ing each WApp. User feedback from workshops will be integrated to finally provide 
an intuitive user interface with consistent process steps and convenient functionality. 
Due to the fact that the IPS² operation resource planning algorithm is based on meta-
heuristics, a guarantee for the real-time requirement cannot be granted. However, 
finding a viable plan will be supported by using multiple computing resources from a 
cloud system. A parallel execution of multiple planning instances will be evaluated 

 
Functional Specification for IPS²-Execution Systems 
515 
(e.g. using island models, [33]), if necessary. Using a cloud computing environment 
will also provide the required availability. To cover the portability requirement, the 
Java programming language [34] will be used. With Java and GWT, no installation 
(apart from a web browser) is required by the client and the installation on the server 
is simplified to installing a web application archive, which is only a file copy process. 
The introduced concepts of the WApps and a plug-in framework, as mentioned above, 
will provide the basis for an extensible and open system. Based on these concepts, all 
services, interfaces and other parts of the systems will be designed and developed. 
This is also valuable for the maintainability requirement, because parts of the applica-
tion can be easily exchanged without stopping the IPS²-ES, so it does not affect its 
availability. The system will be built according to its tools and material approach 
presented in [35], which allows for a quick understanding of the system architecture. 
Hence, new developers can easily understand the IPS²-ES and add or change func-
tions or services. For each WApp a log file will be written. Errors will be reported to 
the responsible person via email together with the latest log files to allow an investi-
gation of the problem. Users will be informed by means of a system-wide approach 
through their WApp so that they may additionally ask for assistance from a support 
team. A security system based on roles will be implemented to decide which user can 
see which content. By restricting the access to whole WApps through roles, unautho-
rized access to data will be additionally avoided. 
7) Documentation. The documentation will be generated as required. The primary 
source of documentation for developers will be the code with the corresponding unit 
tests. An additional system architecture overview will be delivered in a separate doc-
ument in addition to the installation and configuration notes. For the system extension 
guideline, the process of multiple service implementations will be evaluated to serve 
as a basis. 
The functional specification as described above will be used to implement an IPS²-
ES prototype. During the implementation, the requirements can be refined and the 
functional specification adopted. To achieve this, agile software development will be 
applied. The following sections give an overview of what agile software development 
is and why it is suited to be used in a research context. 
5 
Agile Software Development and Implementation of an IPS²-
Execution System Prototype 
Software developments in research projects have special boundary conditions for the 
development process. Research leads to new knowledge and results, which need to be 
considered during the development process. This increase of knowledge is not alone 
to be considered inside the software project itself but also in other research projects. 
This can particularly be found in collaborative research projects where there are inter-
faces between several related projects. These interfaces are further developed, which 
leads to changes in research results such as IT-interfaces and software tools. 

516 
H. Meier, F. Morlock, and T. Dorka 
Large numbers of changes are not only visible in software research projects but  
also in industrial software development projects. In practice it is observed that the 
sequential development of the traditional software development is not able to handle 
many changes in customer needs. To solve this problem, the agile approach was  
invented [36]. The driver for the agile movement was the permanent need for change. 
The aim was to develop a strategy to deal with upcoming changes, not to avoid them 
[37]. For this, Cohn quotes a survey in which 92% of the interviewed persons con-
firmed a superior response to changes in agile projects. Beside the high willingness to 
adopt changes, many advantages can be achieved with an agile approach, for example 
a higher predictability or a faster development process [38]. 
In 2001 leading agile developers agreed on a consistent guideline which was  
composed into the agile manifesto [39], [37]. The agile manifesto with its values and 
principles is available on the internet (http://agilemanifesto.org/) [40]. 
The agile software development has a high impact on the functional specification 
document. Especially the agile value “Responding to change over following a plan” 
and the agile principle “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. 
Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage” are related 
to functional specifications. These support the above-mentioned boundary conditions 
and continuously changing requirements of software development in research projects 
and provide means of dealing with them. Agile values and principles are described in 
detail in agile methods [37]. One of the best known agile methodologies is Scrum 
[38]. Scrum is an iterative and incremental approach for software development.  It 
uses a number of iterations for the development which are called sprints [41]. 
In Scrum, the traditional functional specification is listed in a changeable product 
backlog. The product backlog is the base for the development. At the beginning of a 
project, the product backlog consists of all known requirements. These requirements 
may change during a development process and the updates are reflected by the prod-
uct backlog. [41] 
Another important agile value that is closely connected to the changeability is the 
value of working software. An early software implementation and testing of proto-
types enable new requirements and results [39]. By doing this, software development 
is a learning process [36]. This process is especially important for research projects. 
As a summary, the agile software development has a lot of advantages for devel-
opment in research projects. The early implementations enable early results and the 
changeable functional specification allows the consideration of new results from in-
ternal and external research. Hence, agile approaches are valuable methods for the 
development of an IPS²-ES.

Conclusions and Outlook 
After a short introduction to the topic of IPS² and the IPS²-ES, an overview of a user 
specification of an IPS²-ES and an overview of a first functional specification for the 
development of a prototype have been presented in this paper. The requirements from 

 
Functional Specification for IPS²-Execution Systems 
517 
the user specification have been briefly described and the technical solutions to the 
individual requirements presented in the functional specification. 
These two specifications can now serve as a basis for the development of a proto-
type of an IPS²-ES to demonstrate the benefit the system offers for the delivery of 
IPS². Also, the development of the prototype can deliver new research results and 
allow for improved and more detailed specification documents. Risks in the develop-
ment of the software system can be collected to serve as a guideline for future imple-
mentations of IPS²-ES. To be able to react to constantly changing requirements during 
the development and to have a working test system available as early as possible, the 
agile software development has been proposed.

Abstract. The approach of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) focuses 
on providing added value by integrating products and services. The complexity 
of their multi-disciplinary planning and development calls for methods and 
tools to support this integrated process. Therefore, the authoring tool “IPS² as-
sistance system” has been developed, which represents an extensible framework 
and supports the entire IPS² planning and development process. For the imple-
mentation of this authoring tool, a general data model of IPS² is needed which 
helps with the management and exchange of phase-specific and discipline-
specific data and results. 
For the generation of this model, the phases of the planning and develop-
ment of IPS² are examined based on a generic IPS² development process. The 
results of each phase (discipline-specific data) and their relations to each other 
are then defined and included in the data model. 
Keywords: IPS² development, IPS² data model, IPS² authoring tool, Industrial

Introduction 
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) consist of integrated, interacting product 
and service elements and create an additional benefit throughout their lifecycle for 
customers and suppliers in the context of industrial applications [1-3]. 
Machine tool manufacturers often sell add-on services with the physical product, 
i.e. the machine tool. The influence of service aspects in the design and the use of the 
product are not considered, however, even though the revenue generated by industrial 
services is increasing. Thus, potentials are created by the integration of products and 
services over the entire lifecycle [4], [5]. 
IPS² represent customized solutions and allow a flexible adaptation to changing re-
quirements of both customers and suppliers by the resulting solution space [6]. The 
extension of the solution space increases the organizational complexity, because the 

522 
H. Bochnig et al. 
 
time dimension of the service elements contained in the Industrial Product-Service 
Systems sets special requirements for tools and methods of the IPS² provider [7]. 
IPS² product and service elements depend on and influence each other and, there-
fore, need to be developed together as an integrated system. This puts high demands 
in regard to technical knowledge from different domains (esp. in both fields of  
product design and service engineering) as well as to the process complexity and or-
ganizational complexity. Also, it is necessary to take the interdependencies between 
products and services into account with concurrent and iterative development (sub) 
processes until contradictions are eliminated and the best solution is reached. 
Moreover, a holistic view on the lifecycle of the IPS² should be applied in order to 
obtain the best solution, because the use phase moves into focus of the IPS² provider. 
The responsibility of the provider and the business relation with the customer do not 
end after shipping the product. All of these facts show that IPS² development is more 
demanding in contrast to conventional product design or service engineering [7]. 
While IT support for product design has been available for decades, IT tools for 
service engineering still have a relatively young history, and the integrated develop-
ment is just emerging in the research field. IPS² development requires many different 
partial models resulting from various domains and development phases. However, 
smooth collaboration requires access to the latest development data across the entire 
value chain. Also, homogeneous environments are a success factor for development 
projects. They enable efficient data exchange and synchronization of project members 
and between different disciplines. 
In order to support IPS² developer during the entire planning and development 
process, the authoring tool “IPS² assistance system” has been developed [8]. For the 
implementation of this authoring tool, a general data model of IPS² is needed which 
helps with the management and exchange of phase-specific and discipline-specific 
data and results.

IT Support System for the Integrated IPS² Development as a 
Scope for the General Data Model 
The IT-based authoring tool “IPS² assistance system”, developed at the Institute for 
Machine Tools and Factory Management of TU Berlin, supports the integrated plan-
ning and development processes of Industrial Product-Service Systems. This software 
system guides and supports the developer along the integrated development processes 
of products and pertinent services while constantly considering their mutual interde-
pendencies starting at the earliest development phase. In order to reduce the  
complexity of the development task, the developer is provided with product-service 
module (PSM) libraries and technology databases containing aggregated knowledge 
about products, services, processes and pre-developed module solutions. 
The partial models (specific models used in the respective planning and develop-
ment phases) have to be combined within a consistent user interface. Since IPS² de-
velopment aims at customized solutions, the aspect of customer interaction has to be 
taken into account by providing interfaces to the customer. The software system also

has to be designed to permit an iterative development process. Feedback of changed 
or extended requirements needs to be included in the following development cycle in 
order to approach or reach the best solution for the customer. Finally, the architecture 
of the IPS² assistance system needs to be extensible in order to include other partial 
models. 
Figure 1 depicts the software architecture of the IPS² assistance system, which has 
a modular structure and serves as a framework for the integration of software modules 
and partial data models that correspond to the respective process steps. So far the 
following software modules have been implemented: identification of customer and 
provider needs and their transformation into requirements, the IPS² configuration 
module together with the product-service module library and compatibility informa-
tion database. A top-down approach has been applied to the task, so that after examin-
ing the creation of IPS² from pre-developed product-service modules, the research is 
now focusing in more detail on the creation of the product-service modules, consist-
ing of product and service elements, and the detailed interdependencies between these 
elements [9]. For this framework, the general data model of IPS² has been developed 
in order to manage and standardize the exchange of phase-specific and discipline-
specific data and results in the established industry standard XML.

Process for the Planning and Development of Industrial 
Product-Service Systems 
For the development of physical products as well as IT systems, a number of metho-
dologies exist which define the development process from abstract to detailed levels. 
Widespread methodologies are the VDI guideline 2221, the methodology of 
Pahl/Beitz and for software the V-Model [10-12]. The development and delivery of 
services are not well specified. In [13] a very rough and abstract phase model for 
service development is introduced. Service classes in the engineering field are defined 
in [14] and service delivery described in [13]. A concept for service design with a 
lifecycle context is outlined in [15]. Detailed process models for service development 
are missing at present. 
In the IPS² domain, many generic development concepts and approaches with dif-
ferent focuses have been proposed. For instance, among others, Sakao and Shimomu-
ra have proposed a generic method which has its focus on service design [16]. In the 
field of Eco-Design, a design process for PSS eco-innovation has been proposed [17]. 
In this paper, the generic IPS² development process proposed by Müller [18] will 
be used as a basis to derive an IPS² development process, which sets the scope for the 
generation of the general data model. 
Although the generic IPS² development process fulfils its purpose as a communica-
tion basis by describing IPS² related issues, it is not suitable to serve as a basis to 
derive a general IPS² data model, because it does not contain any specific results of 
development phases. Therefore, an extended process for the planning and develop-
ment of IPS² has been developed, which contains milestones and results of develop-
ment phases (Figure 2). The process has been divided into four phases (planning, 
concept modeling, specification and modularization, embodiment and detailed design) 
with detailed description and results of its execution. This increases the understanding 
for a flow of this specific development process. Between the phases, milestones have 
been defined. They serve as orientation points, at which results of phases are reviewed 
and decisions are made whether or not to start the next phase. Iterative feedback loops 
are not shown in the figure for simplicity reasons. 
3.1 
Planning of Industrial Product-Service Systems 
The planning of IPS² starts with an acquisition of customer needs and values in the 
planning phase. The integration of the customer in the planning and development is a 
key point for providing IPS², which in most cases is a customized solution. Apart 
from customer specific factors (e.g. competences, business strategies, production 
processes) also external factors like legislation, infrastructure, market, competitors, 
etc. have to be considered at this stage. 
As a next step, IPS² requirements are derived from the customer needs. While 
needs, expressed explicitly or implicitly, describe the problem of the customer, re-
quirements are solution-neutral descriptions of the behavior of an IPS² both from a 
customer and provider view [19].

Simultaneously, a use model is determined that benefits both the customer and the 
IPS² provider. A use model describes the usage of the IPS² and the resulting require-
ments in a specific business case. 
3.2 
Concept Modeling of Industrial Product-Service Systems 
From the inputs, the IPS² requirement specification and the IPS² use model, a function 
structure and a concept model are generated in the concept modeling phase. The func-
tion structure is a representation of the intended behavior (the functions) of an IPS² 
and its modules without specifying an IPS² module (product or service), which should 
fulfill the function. For example, a function “temperature monitoring” describes a 
functional behavior of an IPS², which provides the exact temperature of a product 
element that is needed for maintenance. 
A concept model includes a function model and principle solutions of an IPS². It 
describes the structural interaction between them and their logical functionality [20]. 
A principle solution for the function described above could be a temperature sensor 
together with an analysis tool. 
At the same time a customer specific business model is developed based on the 
IPS² use model. A business model is defined as a business relationship between pro-
vider and customer as well as any third parties over the lifecycle of an IPS². It de-
scribes benefits, yield mechanisms, risk allocation, and an ownership of all parties in 
the IPS² network and the organizational implementation [21]. For example, an availa-
bility oriented business model resulting from an availability oriented use model, de-
termines a maintenance contract in order to ensure the functional availability of a 
machine tool over an agreed period of time [22]. Additionally, responsibilities are 
defined for machine tool failure. 
3.3 
Modularization and Specification of Industrial Product-Service Systems 
Based on the concept model, product-service modules can be defined and specified 
for an IPS². The concept of subdividing an IPS² into PSMs is borrowed from systems

engineering, which defines a system as a composition of various subsystems for better 
handling. This means IPS² is a system, a PSM is a subsystem. A PSM consists of 
product and service elements in variable proportions and fulfils one or more func-
tions. Thus, a PSM can take three forms: PSM composed of both product and service 
elements; PSM with product elements only, and PSM with service elements [8]. 
In addition to the specification and definition of PSMs, it is necessary to develop 
important aspects of integration of PSMs into IPS² like ICT infrastructure as well as 
synchronization processes. Together, they build an IPS² architecture. 
3.4 
Embodiment and Detailed Design of Industrial Product-Service Systems 
In this phase variants and possible solutions are generated and evaluated. Existing 
PSMs from a PSM library are assessed in the IPS² configuration step with respect to 
their suitability for the new IPS². PSMs not yet included in the PSM library, must be 
developed in parallel development processes. The methodology resembles the devel-
opment of the IPS² on a higher level. Each PSM requires planning (derivation of  
requirements for PSM), concept modeling (generation of concepts for PSM), specifi-
cation and modularization (second level). Finally, product and service elements of the 
PSMs are drafted and designed. Typically, the embodiment and detailed design of 
PSMs is discipline-specific, for which the market offers many software tools (e.g. 
CAD for technical systems, IDE for software development, process modeling for 
service descriptions). For integrated development, however, the interdependencies 
between the IPS² elements must be considered.

Requirements to the IPS² Data Model 
The partial models of the planning and development phases, and thus also the soft-
ware modules of the IPS² assistance system that support the respective phases, differ 
substantially. They form a very heterogeneous system with diverse data formats. In 
order to enable efficient data exchange and improve communication between devel-
opment phases, a general data model of IPS² for the authoring tool IPS² assistance 
system is needed. A data model defines the structure and intended meaning of data 
[23]. The general IPS² data model should 
• support the entire planning and development process across all process phases, 
• allow for development of a concrete IPS² instance for a particular customer, 
• allow the management of data for IPS² authoring, 
• represent all the different elements of IPS², 
• allow the modeling of the interdependencies between the IPS² elements (essential 
due to the focus on an integrated development), 
• allow for combining IPS² elements to modules and thus a modularization of IPS², 
• carry along results across phase borders, 
• be generic, not domain specific, 
• allow traceability of results from preceding phases and process steps,

• preferably be simple, not too complex, 
• be flexible and extensible, 
• contain different views on the model and 
• allow links between partial models.

General Data Model for Industrial Product-Service Systems 
5.1 
Data Structure of the General IPS² Data Model 
Based on the requirements defined in section 4, the general data model is being de-
veloped (Figure 3). The first step is to identify the model elements. Primarily, the 
elements will be intermediate results of the entire planning and development process, 
which are generated during the aforementioned phases. In particular such results are 
of interest which are necessary inputs for subsequent phases, because of the focus on 
supporting the planning and development and allowing the traceability of results 
across all phases. 
The root element is the particular IPS² instance that needs to be developed. It is de-
rived from a specific inquiry or order of a customer. The IPS² model element serves 
as a container for the following elements, which are associated directly or indirectly 
with this IPS² instance. 
The needs and the IPS² requirements specification from the planning phase form 
the direct basis for all development steps. The results of the development phases must 
at any time meet the needs of the customer and provider, which should constantly be 
checked. The IPS² use model is another result of the planning phase. It is included in 
the IPS² business model, which is further developed in the concept modeling phase. 
Business model, contract, IPS² function structure and IPS² concept are essential 
elements from the concept modeling phase. A revenue model is added to the IPS² use 
model. Together with the value configuration they form the IPS² business model [22]. 
The contract creates an institutional framework, which regulates the rights, duties and 
responsibilities and establishes the business relation between the IPS² provider and 
the customer [21]. The contract model element is gradually completed from a basic 
structure to the final contract. The IPS² function structure has a hierarchical composi-
tion with higher-level and lower-level functions. This is modeled by the self-referring 
relationship. 
During the modularization and specification phase at system level, an IPS² archi-
tecture is derived from the concept, and principle solutions are merged into product-
service modules. The IPS² architecture describes how the PSMs integrate with each 
other and form the IPS² as a whole. 
The PSMs are subsequently designed and detailed in the drafting and design phase 
and consist of product and service elements. Components of product elements can 
have a mechanic, electric/electronic or a software based nature. The discipline-
specific development results like 3D-CAD models, EDA (Electronic Design Automa-
tion) models, simulation models and source code as well as platform-specific  
executable programs are stored here as product elements. The service elements  

528 
H. Bochnig et al. 
 
consist of processes (which include process steps and their sequence) and resources 
(which can be personnel, tools, consumables or auxiliary equipment). 
The model elements are connected by relationships, which add semantics to the 
UML model. The following types of relationships have been used in the general IPS² 
data model: association, composition and generalization. 
An association relationship is a structural relationship between two model ele-
ments, which shows that objects of one element connect objects and can navigate to 
objects of another element. A composition relationship is a type of aggregation and 
represents a relationship between an element that is a part of or subordinate to another 
element. A generalization relationship indicates that a specialized child element is 
based on a general parent element [24].

Fig. 4. Interdependencies in the general IPS² data model 
In general the associations used in the model result directly from the order of the 
planning and development steps. Additionally, crosslinks have been inserted to incor-
porate multiple partial models or results from one phase and from parallel process 
steps. 
The composition at the IPS² model element denotes the modularization concept of 
IPS². IPS² consist of one or more product-service modules, which in turn are com-
posed of product and service elements. The latter are formed by the set of process and 
resource. The composition relationship has been used in this case because the devel-
opment of a particular IPS² instance is concerned. Therefore, the model elements 
represent concrete instances of results of each phase and are valid only for this partic-
ular IPS² instance. 
The product element is the generalization of the disciplines mechanics, elec-
trics/electronics and software. Thus, a PSM can consist of and fulfill its function by 
components from the three disciplines and/or processes that are executed by or with 
the help of resources. This reflects the substitutability between solution variants for 
one function, which can be product-centric or service-centric or even consist of only 
one element type. 
5.2 
Interdependencies between IPS² Elements 
The integrated development of IPS² makes it necessary to describe the interdependen-
cies between IPS² elements. These interdependencies can be found at different levels 
within an IPS². The highest level is that of product-service modules. The next level is 
represented by the product and service elements. The third level consists of the discip-
line-specific components as well as the processes and resources. The attributes of

these components, processes and resources are on the last and most detailed level. In 
this context attributes are characteristics or properties of the components, processes 
and resources like object mass, duration of a process step and qualification of a  
technician. 
 
Fig. 5. Simplified model of interdependencies in general IPS² data model 
Interdependencies can exist either within each of these levels or across these levels. 
In figure 4 the association relationships represent the identified interdependencies 
within the levels. The inter-dependencies across levels have been omitted in favor of 
better clarity. The composition relationship in the model also implies interdependen-
cies across levels. If the components or parts of the elements belong to a whole, they 
need to be compatible with each other, and there exists a dependency between the 
whole and the part. 
Different types of interdependency relationships can be assigned. At the higher  
levels the interdependencies can be described by the relationships “requires” and in-
versely “enables”. For example, condition monitoring (PSM level) may be a require-
ment for preventive maintenance (PSM level). In turn, sensors have to be integrated 
into the mechanical product (element or component level) for this purpose. Another 
example is that an inspection service (element level) together with its process and 
resources (component level) is needed for wear testing a roller bearing (component 
level). Also, a technician (resource/component level) needs a certain qualification 
(attribute level) for a maintenance process, which he can obtain by training (element 
level). 
The interdependency relationships on detail level can be described as interdepen-
dencies between the attributes of the components, processes and resources. For this, 
the relationship types “identical”, “not less than” and “not more than” have been iden-
tified. For instance, a wrench needs to have the same size like the hexagon screw to

be removed. The lifting of a heavy object during the manual execution of a process is 
another example. The maximum permitted weight of the product varies and depends 
on the use of a lifting device. Finally, the minimum qualification of service technician 
depends on the specific type of a product. 
The interdependency relationships in figure 4 have been modeled extensively. In 
order to reduce the complexity of the model, a simplified model has been derived. In 
figure 5 the generalization relationship has been used to save the detailed relation-
ships between process and resource on one side and the discipline-specific compo-
nents on the other side as well as their self-references. Due to the generalization  
concept, one relationship each from the process and resource elements, and one self-
reference at the product element, suffice to describe the same relationships.

Conclusion and Outlook 
For the integrated development of complex systems, such as IPS², new methods and 
tools are needed. However, IT support for the integrated development of IPS² is hard 
to find and no standards exist for the exchange of IPS² data within an IPS² authoring 
tool during the entire planning and development phases. 
To overcome these difficulties, a general data model has been developed and im-
plemented in the authoring tool “IPS² assistance system”, which supports the entire 
IPS² planning and development. The data model includes partial models from all the 
phases of IPS² planning and development. Furthermore, it describes possible interde-
pendencies between product and service elements in detailed as well as in simplified 
form. 
As a next step the general IPS² data model shall be customized and detailed for 
specific industry cases and tested with various information standards, documents and 
models in the respective industry sector. It can be extended to integrate existing IT 
systems into the IPS² assistance system. For this purpose interfaces for data exchange 
need to be implemented.

Abstract. Design of services at the use stage of products is crucial for the man-
ufacturing industry to increase value delivery to product users through the life 
cycle. The paper proposes an approach to computational hypothesis formation 
regarding these services to meet given goals and quality criteria as specifica-
tions. The hypothesis formation procedure, which consists of analysis, sugges-
tion, and transformation of service-related business models, represents the  
reasoning of designers by abduction, and implemented on a service CAD tool. 
The representation of a business model suitable to support the procedure is  
proposed and it is compared with related work about service modeling.  
Keywords: service modeling, abduction, computer-aided design.

Introduction 
Study of Product Service Systems (PSS) is concerned with design, analysis and im-
plementation of business models from various (e.g., economic, environmental, and 
socio-cultural) perspectives. In the manufacturing industry, such business models are 
designed considering services offered during life cycle of a product (e.g., monitoring, 
repair, upgrading services, and consumable supplies) as well as reconfiguration of the 
product adapted to the services [2]. Some of the services maintain and enhance the 
functions of a product during the entire life span, while others deliver a variety of 
contents (e.g., information) to the users of a product, which is regarded as a channel 
of the service delivery.  
Abduction [3] is a form of reasoning, by which new knowledge is hypothesized for 
the explanation of an observed fact. In natural science, scientists hypothesize a physi-
cal rule by abduction for the explanation of an observed behavior (e.g., gravity to 
explain free fall of objects on the earth). Past literature argued the role of abduction in 
design [4] and methods and tools to support design by means of abduction. For in-
stance, Takeda et al. [5] formalized abduction in design. Shimomura et al. [6] reported 
an abduction-based design method for service design. As reported in the past litera-
ture, abduction in design is meant to hypothesize structural and behavioral concepts, 
which will be realized so as to meet specific functional and technical requirements. 
Therefore, the capability to support designers to hypothesize such concepts is re-
garded as a crucial function of methods and tools supporting abduction in design.

The paper presents an approach to hypothesis formation performed at the design of 
a manufacturers’ business model related to the use stage of a product. The goals of the 
presented approach are to (i) formalize a procedure for a designer to hypothesize the 
concepts of services related to a product that are suitable to the given requirements 
specified by an user of the product and (ii) propose a computational tool to support 
the procedure using the knowledge about products and services, which is separately 
defined and collected by the users and manufacturers of other products. By achieving 
these goals, the designer of such a business model can systematically search and find 
services that potentially enhance the value of the product used in the business model, 
as he¥she does in product design [7], and identify the characteristics of the product 
suitable to the services.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the paper briefly re-
views the study of service and business modeling methods and computational tools 
accompanied with the methods. Section 3 proposes an approach to hypothesis forma-
tion, and the business model representation to support the approach. Section 4 reports 
a computational tool, which supports for the design of manufacturers’ business mod-
els followed by the presented approach. Section 5 summarizes the paper.

2.1 
Service and Business Modeling Methods 
Study of PSS for the manufacturing industry has proposed a number of methods to 
describe manufacturers’ business models. They consist of products, services, and their 
interrelations. The previous conference proceeding [8] included some of the methods 
(e.g., [6, 9-13]). They are useful for various purposes, such as the organization of 
design knowledge, sharing of the knowledge among designers, and the development 
of design support tools.  
The abovementioned methods are mainly based on the study of service modeling, 
because services are regarded as crucial elements of manufacturers’ business models. 
Service models have been studied by researchers in the field of marketing [14, 15], 
operational management [16], service research [17], and service engineering [18-20]. 
These models are common in that services are regarded as activities or processes, 
while they are different one another mainly in terms of the types of related concepts 
expressed with services.  
The representation of a business model presented in the paper is an extension of the 
service model proposed in the field of service engineering [18-20]. It defines service 
as an activity to deliver service content from a service receiver to a service provider 
with a service channel. It is chosen in this study due to the following reasons. First, it 
represents not only a business model but also its specifications, which is suitable to 
the qualitative evaluation of a business model and the hypothesis formation regarding 
services and relevant concepts with reference to given specifications (see Section 3). 
Second, it represents the details of service contents, channels, receivers, and providers 
included in a business model in terms of their parameters, which is useful to charac-
terize each of these service elements. Third, it has been employed by tools to compu-
tationally support the design of service and business models (e.g., [6, 20, 21]).

2.2 
Computational Tools 
In parallel with the study of service and business modeling methods, tools to support 
the design of service and business models has been studied. Functions of these tools 
are various, including visualization, checklist-based evaluation [22], simulation-based 
evaluation [21], analysis of relations among actors (e.g.., service providers and re-
ceivers) [23], analysis of relation among their parameters [20]. Although a number of 
tools support the analysis and evaluation of service and business models, few tools 
support the design of these models. 
As described earlier, abduction (or hypothesis formation) is a crucial reasoning in 
design. The paper proposes a formal procedure to computationally support the intro-
duction of services in the life cycle of a product as hypotheses to meet the given spe-
cifications, while refining the characteristics of the product. The procedure is different 
from the abduction-based creative design procedure implemented in the Service CAD 
system [6]. The proposed approach is based on the search of new knowledge about 
products and services that meets the given unsatisfied specifications (see Section 3), 
while the Service CAD system searches new knowledge about products and services 
that are similar to existing ones by means of analogy. Both systems are similar in that 
they can utilize the knowledge about products and services defined in different do-
mains (e.g., industrial sectors).

Formalization 
This section formalizes a procedure of hypothesis formation in context of the design 
of a business model employed at the use stage of a product as well as the representa-
tion of such a business model suitable for the hypothesis formulation.  
3.1 
A Business Model 
Fig. 1 shows the proposed representation of a business model, which is considered 
suitable to the hypothesis formation (see Section 1). A business model is defined by 
concept nodes and their relations (i.e., a network of concept nodes), which qualitative-
ly characterizes the business. Each concept node belongs to the specification domain 
(e.g., WHAT to realize in the business) and the realization domain (HOW to realize 
the business). These domains appear in product models used for conceptual design 
(e.g., [24]), in which the specification domain is described in terms of the functions of 
a product, while the state, structure, and behavior (i.e., embodiment) realizing the 
functions are the part of a product model in the realization domain (Fig. 1 (a)). The 
specification domain of the presented model consists of the goal domain and quality 
domain, while the realization domain consists of activity domain and environment 
domain (Fig. 1 (b)). Thus, an instance of the proposed model consists of nodes be-
longing to these domains and their relations (Fig. 1 (c)).  
Difference between the product model for conceptual (product) design and the 
proposed model for business model design is the treatment of dynamic property. In 
product design, the behavior of a product is often predictable by physical rule-based

Environment. In design of a business model, a numbers of stakeholders and service 
channels are considered. The proposed representation treats these stakeholders and 
service channels as element nodes in the environment domain (or service environment 
[19]). Each element node has parameter nodes (Fig. 2 (7)) The execution condition of 
an activity node is defined by connected condition nodes (Fig. 2 (8)), which are con-
nected with parameter nodes (Fig. 2 (1)). The state change of an element node is 
caused as a result of the execution of an activity node (Fig. 2 (2)). Furthermore, it de-
fines the realization of a goal specified by a relation between an activity node and a goal 
node (Fig. 2 (5)). The parameters of stakeholders and service channels are related to the 
quality criteria specified by a set of relations between a parameter node and a quality 
node. The relations partly represent the parameter network including quality, service 
receiver parameters, service channel parameters, service content parameters [19].  
Service Element Classification. Element nodes in the environment domain can be 
classified into service providers, service receivers, service channels, and service con-
tents. They are not mutually exclusive. For instance, an intermediate agent has double 
characteristics of a service receiver and a service provider [19]. A car is considered as 
service content, when the ownership of the car is delivered. The same car is regarded 
as a service channel, when a taxi driver uses the car, which delivers mobility to cus-
tomers of the driver. (In this example, mobility is the content of the service.) The 
multiple roles of stakeholders and service channels cause difficulty for designers to 
classify them into service elements in service environment. For this reason, the com-
putational support introduced in the paper does not use such classification.

define each service class are shown. The colored nodes with label A are activity nodes 
regarded as services. 
Service with Contents Delivery (Fig. 3 (a)). When an activity node is directly re-
lated to a goal node, it is regarded as a service to deliver contents to realize the goal 
represented by the connected goal node (Fig. 2 (3)). The class is used to define a  
service, whose influence on the state of service environment is unknown or unobserv-
able. Thus, the description of services belonging to the class does not provide know-
ledge concerning the parameters of elements in environment. Examples of services 
belonging to this class are functional sales service (delivery of function) and message-
type service (delivery of information) [19], if the consequences of these services are 
not explicitly defined in terms of the state of elements of environment. If so, these 
services are regarded as services with state transition, which is explained below. 
Service with State Transition (Fig. 3 (b)). A service classified in the category is 
recognized in terms of state transition of environment. Therefore, there is no direct 
connection between an activity node and a goal node. Instead, they are connected 
through a parameter node. The same service can be described with both (1) service 
with contents delivery and (2) service with state transition. For instance, transporta-
tion service can be described as “service to deliver mobility (as service content)” and 
as “service to change the geographical state of passengers”. When designers select the 
former service class, they emphasize the delivery of service contents. Otherwise, they 
choose the latter service class so that they can explain service in terms of state transi-
tion of environment.  
Enhancing Service (Fig. 3 (c)). An enhancing service is defined by an activity node 
related to the parameter node (Fig. 2 (1)) related to a quality node (Fig. 2 (6)) related 
to an activity node (Fig. 2 (4)).  For example, the comfort of tourists during stay at a 
hotel room can be enhanced by providing room cleaning service during the entire 
stay, assuming the comfort is associated with the cleanness as a parameter of the hotel 
room. In the example, the room cleaning service is labeled A, the cleanness of the 
room is P, the comfort of tourists is Q, and the stay is regarded as activity evaluating 
the quality A*, respectively.  
Enabling Service (Fig. 3 (d)). An enabling service changes the parameter value of 
elements in environment (Fig. 2 (2)). The parameter is related to a condition node of 
an activity node (Fig. 2 (1)), which is regarded as one of the abovementioned service 
classes. In Fig. 3 (d), the activity node regarded as an enabling service is A, while the 
enabled activity node belonging to the other service classes is A*. For example, tour-
ists to do scuba diving in a small island, they may need to rent scuba gears. They may 
also need to get license to do so at school. Renting scuba gears and receive education 
themselves do not provide experience in deep sea. However, they are necessary to 
have the experience. In the example, scuba diving is the service delivering experience 
as service content, while other activities are services enabling the service.

Analysis, Suggestion, and Transformation of PSS Design Knowledge 
This subsection describes three types of supports for the design of a business model 
based on the presented representation. First, the representation provides logics to ana-
lyze a business model under development. Second, business models built in advance 
is selected to complement a business model under development. Third, the selected 
business model is transformed so that it fits to the context of the business model under 
development. These supports, as a whole, are regarded as an integrated support realiz-
ing abduction or hypothesis formulation on a business model under development.  
Analysis. First, in the analysis, concept nodes shown in Table 2 are regarded as in-
complete nodes due to lack of relations to other concept nodes. The relations in Table 
2 are indexed following Table 1. Goal nodes in a business model that are related to 
activity nodes or parameter nodes included in the service with state transition class are 
unrealized. Quality nodes that are not related to any parameter node are immeasura-
ble. Quality nodes that are not evaluated by any activity node are unevaluated.  
Parameter nodes, which are not connected with any concept node, are unjustified. 
Thus, the removal of all unjustified parameter nodes does not influence the interpreta-
tion of the current case.

Suggestion. After the analysis of all concept nodes defined a business model, incom-
plete nodes and missing relations are identified. After that, concept nodes and their 
relations to be added to the business model is suggested. The added nodes and rela-
tions are derived from other business models, which potentially connect the concept 
nodes in the business model. The suggestion procedure starts with selection of a con-
cept node in the business model. The selected concept node is usually one of such 
insufficient nodes as unrealized goal, immeasurable quality, unevaluated quality, or 
unjustified parameter nodes. Then, other business models, which consist of a couple 
of a concept node and its relation, which replaces the missing relation in the business 
model, are regarded as candidate parts added to the business model.  
Transformation. One of the suggested business models is adapted to the business 
model under development. However, the knowledge about the suggested business 
model is not directly adaptable. To do so, the binding between the conceptual nodes 
in the business model under development and the suggested business model is neces-
sary. As a result of the binding, each concept node of the suggested business model

specifications as goals and quality criteria. The formation procedure, which consists 
of analysis, suggestion, transformation of a business model, has been designed so as 
to represent the reasoning performed by the designer of a manufacturers’ business 
model by means of abduction, which hypothesize missing elements of a business 
model to be found in the realization domain in order to satisfy the elements defined in 
the specification domain. The paper has shown a tool to support these procedures.  
For the representation of a business model suitable to the support has been pro-
posed, which is based on the service modeling studied in the field of service engineer-
ing. As a result of the development of the support and its implementation, it was 
found that the representation was also useful to classify activities in a business model 
in relation to other concept nodes in the business model.

Abstract. Companies are forced to rethink their product-focused business stra-
tegies due to technological equivalence and a severe price competition. Product-
Service Systems (PSS) allow for long-term customer loyalty and an increase in 
profit margins. The systematic development of PSS is essential in order to tap 
their full potential. However, the integration of heterogeneous components dur-
ing the PSS-development still poses a major challenge. It necessitates the  
integration of heterogeneous information held by actors with very different pro-
fessional backgrounds. Especially the systematic consolidation, archiving and 
reuse of heterogeneous service information during the PSS-concept develop-
ment represent a considerable gap in research. Furthermore, the modeling of 
remote-supported and automated services during the domain-specific detailing 
of PSS has not been sufficiently researched yet. Hence, this paper presents a 
novel approach, referred to as Computer-aided Service Design (CASD), used to 
systematically integrate heterogeneous service information into a PSS’s concept 
development and to model manual, but also remote-supported and automated 
services.

Introduction 
1.1 
The Necessity of Product-Service Systems (PSS) 
Product-centric business strategies have to be reconsidered by today’s companies due 
to technological equivalence, decreasing profit margins and a severe price competi-
tion caused by the increasing international rivalry. This is attended by an increasing 
customer demand for greater company support and reliability during an entire product 
life cycle [1] [2]. Many companies answer to this request by offering services, mostly 
in the area of maintenance. But, due to short-term strategies, they often fail to turn 
this into an economic success [3] [4] [5].  
Product-Service Systems (PSS) constitute a change in paradigm. Such lifecycle-
oriented problem solutions ask for value-oriented business strategies instead of pure 
product- or service-offers. Thereby, PSS not only allow for a constant distinction of 
competitors and long-term customer loyalty, but for the increase in profit margins. 
Moreover, many authors connect PSS to the reduction of environmental impact [6] [7]

[8]. Although the conceptual composition of the term PSS indicates a system only 
consisting of products and services depending on the respective offer, a value proposi-
tion is put into action with the aid of physical artifacts and/or software and/or 
processes and services as well as by a network of different stakeholders. While the 
ratio of products, software and processes can vary relative to the value proposition 
that is to be put into practice, a certain amount of services is indispensable [9].  
1.2 
The Development of PSS  
The systematic development of PSS has a substantial influence on their economic and 
ecological success [10]. On an abstract level, the development of PSS can be subdi-
vided into two main phases: a PSS’s concept development (phase 1) and its domain-
specific detailing (phase 2). During an early stage of the PSS-development, referred to 
as PSS-concept development, the aim is to create an abstract idea of how a value 
proposition can be put into practice. Therefore, different components, like products, 
software and services are integrated, but without detailing each component. This 
phase can result in either one or several PSS-concepts. A PSS-concept or rather its 
components are developed separately during the domain-specific detailing of a PSS. 
An interdisciplinary team uses domain-specific development methods and tools  
during this phase. A superior requirement management continuously guarantees the 
consistent integration and detailing of all components. Thereby, it is ensured that 
(inter)dependencies between heterogeneous components are constantly considered 
during the entire PSS-development [11] [12].   
1.3 
Heterogeneity during the Development of PSS 
The heterogeneity of PSS-components (e.g. products, services, software) leads to an 
extended complexity during the development of PSS because it necessitates the inte-
gration of most diverse information held by actors with very different professional 
backgrounds. Such complexity is increased by the heterogeneity of the service do-
main itself. Services vary not only strongly in themselves (e.g. maintenance, training, 
consulting, recycling, certification, etc.), but also with regard to the multiplicity of 
products, software or persons they are assigned to. 
The selection of actors necessary to develop PSS is a major challenge. During a 
PSS’s concept development, different professional knowledge is essential in order to 
create innovative, value-oriented PSS-concepts. However, the heterogeneity of ser-
vices highly complicates the precise location of service know-how within a company. 
Depending on the respective service, actors from different divisions and hierarchical 
levels may possess the required service information. This influences the domain-
specific detailing of services as well. For instance, the detailing of maintenance  
similarly requires the know-how of the design engineer’s as well as the practical 
knowledge of the involved service technicians. Hence, very different professional 
expertise is needed, depending on the respective service. This applies to manual, re-
mote-supported and automated services. These coherences are illustrated in figure 1.

To put it concisely, the descriptions above are summarized as follows: The devel-
opment of PSS requires the integration of heterogeneous information held by various 
actors. Services are an indispensable part of PSS (s. chapter 1.1). Hence, the syste-
matic integration of service know-how into the PSS-concept development significant-
ly contributes to the targeted development of value-oriented and innovative PSS. 
However, especially the systematic consolidation, archiving and reuse of heterogene-
ous service information during a PSS’s concept development present themselves as a 
major gap in research. Furthermore, the standardized modeling of manual,

1.4 
Computer-Aided Service Engineering (CASD) – A Novel Approach 
This paper presents a novel approach, referred to as Computer-aided Service Design 
(CASD), which closes the aforementioned research gaps. CASD offers interactive 
user assistance during the entire development of a PSS, plausibility checks with re-
gard to service contents as well as a reduction of development time and costs.  
Required service knowledge is automatically generated during a PSS’s concept de-
velopment based on a complex system of rules. Heterogeneous service information 
are systematically consolidated and archived with the aid of CASD. Furthermore, the 
standardized modeling of manual and for the first time also remote-supported and 
automated services is made allowance for during a PSS’s domain-specific detailing. 
In addition, service times and costs are calculated automatically based on a specific 
service process design.  
Consecutively, a description of CASD and its benefits is presented. Prior to this, 
the concept service is redefined, since it changes in the context of PSS. Thereby, the 
aim is to specify services as “design objects” which are generated and modeled with 
the aid of CASD.  
2 
Rethinking the Concept Service in the Context of PSS 
PSS represent value-oriented business strategies and therefore no longer gear towards 
the selling of products. In the same way the role of products has changed in the con-
text of PSS, the existing understanding of services has to be questioned as well. As 
part of a detailed analysis which considers both theory and case examples it has been 
investigated, whether the established definition of the concept service can be equally 
used in the context of PSS or whether a revised form is required. The results of this 
analysis are presented in chapter 2.2. Prior to this, the definition of the concept ser-
vice, as it is currently known in literature, is introduced in chapter 2.1. Due to its 
complexity, the analysis itself is not further detailed in this paper, but can be looked 
up in [9].  
2.1 
Traditional and Internal Services  
In service research, a standardized definition of the term service does not exist. None-
theless, the majority of authors explain services with the aid of three dimensions or 
the three constitutive characteristics which result from these. With regard to the “ca-
pability dimension” a service is explained as the ability and willingness of a provider 
to render the service in question. Such ability is considered intangible. Therefore, the 
first constitutive characteristic used to define a service is “intangibility” [13].  
 

 
CASD for the Development of PSS – Motivation and Benefits 
551 
 
With reference to the “process dimension” a service is characterized by its simulta-
neous consumption and production as well as by the integration of so called external 
factors. Examples for such factors are the customer’s personnel, goods, rights or in-
formation. In this regard, the term “external” points out that a service’s provider is 
never part of its customer’s company. Hence, the second and third constitutive  
characteristics, referred to as “uno-actu-principle” and “integration of external fac-
tors”, result from the process dimension [13].  
The definition of the notion service which follows from the “result dimension” is 
the most discussed one. While some authors argue that a service results in tangible 
and intangible outputs, others persist that a service has intangible output only. In the 
following, a service’s output is considered solely intangible. For example, the output 
of a machine’s repair is the machine’s restored operativeness. Tangible parts such as 
spare parts are considered to be technical resources during a service’s provision rather 
than a tangible output. This means that the first constitutive characteristic can also be 
derived from the result dimension [13] [14]. Consequently, processes which comply 
with the previously explained three constitutive characteristics are subsequently called 
traditional services.  
In opposition to traditional services where a provider and its customer are never 
part of one company, the receiver of an internal service is part of the company who 
offers and provides the service in question. Hence, an internal service is not de-
manded by an external customer, but by the provider’s personnel themselves. Fur-
thermore, an internal service is rendered only within the provider’s company or rather 
its property. From this follows that internal services can be equally defined by the first 
and second constitutive characteristics but do not integrate external factors [15].  
2.2 
New Services in the Context of PSS 
Three new types of services have been defined in the context of PSS in addition to tradi-
tional and internal services. They result from the previously mentioned analysis of the 
concept service. An analysis of the capability dimension and result dimension of tradi-
tional, internal and new services has proved that the previously established definition of 
such dimensions can be equally applied (see chapter 2.1). The constitutive characteristic 
“intangibility” similarly applies to traditional, internal and new services.  
Hence, the defined new services differ from traditional and internal services in 
terms of their process dimension. While the uno-actu-principle applies to new servic-
es as well, the combination of the process-related characteristics “receiver of a  
service”, “allocation of resources and responsibility” and “location of a service’s pro-
vision” clearly points out the differences between traditional, internal services and 
new services. Table 1 compares traditional services (type 1.1 to type 1.4), internal 
services (type 2.1 to type 2.2) and new services (type 3 to 5 type) based on the pre-
viously stated characteristics. Each line represents one specific type of service.

Service type 3 does not integrate external factors. Hence, it cannot be considered to 
be a traditional service. The provider of service type 3 is at the same time its receiver. 
Yet, service type 3 is not rendered at a PSS-provider’s location, but at its customer’s 
property. As a result, service type 3 cannot be defined as an internal service.  
Equally to service type 3, service type 4 is rendered at a PSS-customer’s location, 
but, in opposition to type 3, external factors are integrated. But, although service type 
4 integrates external factors, it cannot be labeled a traditional service, because the 
PSS-provider is at the time the receiver of the service.  
The provider and receiver of service type 5 is the customer of a PSS. Type 5 is 
rendered at a PSS-customer’s location. Moreover, the PSS-customer bears full re-
sponsibility for the service’s successful provision. Yet, resources of the PSS-provider 
are integrated into the provision of type 5. Hence, service type 5 cannot be considered 
as a traditional or an internal service.  
In the following, the definition of new services is exemplified. The respective  
examples are presented in table 2. Each new service is related to a particular busi-
ness’s strategies which is derived from the descriptions of [16]. Each of these strate-
gies can occur in the context of PSS. Especially example 3 points out that although in 
the context of PSS the focus is no longer on the sale of products, customers still may 
request it.

A revised form of the concept service is necessary and has been introduced in 
chapter 2 of this paper. Thereby, the “design object” service could be specified for its 
use within the scope of CASD. In the following, CASD and its use during the devel-
opment of PSS are introduced.

Computer-Aided Service Design (CASD) 
3.1 
CASD – Research Motivation 
A detailed analysis of the service and PSS literature has confirmed that the systematic 
integration of heterogeneous service information into the concept development of PSS 
has not been sufficiently researched yet [9] [17]. Existing approaches concentrate on 
the visualization of services and their influence on the receiver [18] [19] [20] [21] 
[22] [23] [24] [25]. Some authors particularly focus on the integrated modeling of 
products and services [21] [26] [27] [28]. However, none of them highlight how hete-
rogeneous service knowledge held by actors with very different expertise can be sys-
tematically consolidated, archived and context-sensitively reused during an early 
stage of the PSS-development [9].  
Furthermore, if the visualization of services is focused on, it only addresses the 
modeling of manual services. However, depending on the respective value proposi-
tion that is to be put into practice, the development of manual, but also remote-
supported and automated services is equally required during the domain-specific  
detailing of a PSS [9]. 
This paper presents a novel approach which closes the aforementioned research 
gaps. A detailed description of the literature analysis can be looked up in [9]. The 
structure of CASD is outlined in chapter 3.2. Its use during the PSS-concept devel-
opment and the domain-specific detailing is presented in chapters 3.3 and 3.4. Based 
on that, the realized software prototype is introduced in chapter 3.5.  
3.2 
CASD – Structure 
The reuse of heterogeneous service expertise is of particular importance during the 
concept development of PSS, because it specifically enhances the development of 
innovative value-oriented PSS-concepts. CASD particularly supports actors from 
different hierarchical levels and divisions in reusing diverse service information, as 
CASD context-sensitively generates these (chapter 3.3).  
It also offers the modeling of manual, remote-supported and automated services 
during the domain-specific detailing of PSS (chapter 3.4). Service costs, service time 
and required resources are automatically generated based on a specific service design. 
Each modeled service is archived, so that it can be reused and modified in a context-
specific way.  
In order to enhance the systematic consolidation of heterogeneous service exper-
tise, which is the basis for the context-sensitive generation of diverse service informa-
tion, a software assistant has been integrated into CASD. It particularly enhances the 
efficient archiving due to its interactive user assistance.

A so called “service overview” allows for the continuous tracking of service in-
formation which have been integrated into a particular PSS-concept. The previously 
described structure of CASD is illustrated in figure 2.

3.3 
CASD – Generating Heterogeneous Service Information during the  
PSS-Concept Development 
The PSS-concept development aims at the value-oriented integration of various PSS-
elements. Services are essential elements of every PSS-concept. Hence, CASD  
pursues the following goals:  
• the automatic and context-sensitive generation of heterogeneous service informa-
tion, based on information which is available at an early stage of the PSS-
development  
• a systematic consolidation and archiving of diverse service information held by 
actors with different professional backgrounds  
The automatic generation is initiated by selecting the following so called generation 
criteria: the targeted value proposition (1), the life cycle phase in which the service in 
question is to be rendered (2), the product, process or person the required services 
relates to (3), the definition of the product’s ownership (PSS-provider/PSS-customer) 
or the assignment of a person/process to the PSS-provider/PSS-customer (4) and the 
legal obligation of the required service (5). 
Based on the selected generation criteria or rather their values, a list of potential 
services is automatically generated (6). Out of this list, the PSS-developer/team picks 
a specific service out of that list (7). Now, the selected service is further detailed by: 
choosing a specific service case out of a list of different case differentiations which 
are related to the chosen service (8), negating or approving of the remote support of 
the selected service (9), selecting the level of service automation (manual service, 
semi-automated or automated service) (10) and assigning the respective responsibility 
which clarifies whether the PSS-provider or PSS-customer is responsible for the accu-
rate service provision (11).  
The consistency of a PSS-concept is enhanced with the aid of CASD significantly. 
In this regard, CASD automatically generates services which are logically interrelated 
with the initially selected service (12). Thereby, it is ensured that all services which 
are dependent on each other are integrated into the respective PSS-concept. A simple 
example clarifies such interrelations: the repair of a machine tool requires the condi-
tion monitoring of the respective machine tool. Otherwise there is no trigger for the 
repair. In turn, the machine’s repairs can be reduced by regular maintenance. Hence, 
regular maintenance, repair and condition monitoring are logically interrelated and 
have to be similarly integrated into the respective PSS-concept.  
CASD advances the standardization of services during the PSS-concept develop-
ment, as interrelated service functions are generated automatically. This means that 
the previously chosen service, which represents the main function, is now comple-
mented with so called auxiliary functions, support functions and subfunctions (13). A 
main function determines a service’s principal task (e.g. “repair machine”). An aux-
iliary function is used to further detail a particular service (e.g. “prepare workstation” 
or “perform functional check”). A support function represents a provider’s remote 
support (e.g. “support repair” or “support functional check”). A subfunction is used to 
further detail a main function, an auxiliary function or a support function. In general, 

 
CASD for the Development of PSS – Motivation and Benefits 
557 
 
each function is formally described by a verb combined with a noun. Since each ser-
vice function represents a specific part of a service, CASD automatically highlights 
which part is provided at a PSS-provider’s location and which is rendered at a PSS-
customer’s property.  
The automatic generation of service modules allows for the systematic domain-
specific detailing of the chosen service. In this regard, the previously generated  
service functions are transformed into a main module, auxiliary modules, support 
modules and submodules (14). Such modules mainly differ from the aforementioned 
functions by their interfaces. In opposition to existing approaches, a service module’s 
interface is described by the status of the noun used to formally describe a particular 
function. In this regard, a module’s input is consistent with the status of the noun 
before a respective function’s fulfillment (e.g. “not repaired machine tool”). A mod-
ule’s output accords with the noun’s status after a certain function’s fulfillment (e.g. 
“repaired machine tool”). The transformation from one status into another is 
represented by the verb used to formally describe a function to be fulfilled (e.g. “re-
pair”). As a result, manual, remote-supported and automated service processes can be 
hidden within a module according to the principles of modularization referred to as 
“limited access” and “loose coupling”. This allows for more flexibility during a PSS’s 
domain-specific detailing, because modules or rather their contents can be changed 
individually without interfering with the contents of related modules. Furthermore, 
with regard to time-critical processes, different versions of such service processes can 
be hidden simultaneously within a single module. 
A complex system of rules guarantees the plausibility of the automatically generat-
ed service information. For example, the selection of a product’s ownership is re-
stricted by the previously chosen value proposition, the distinction of cases is limited 
by the selected service and value proposition, the level of automation is narrowed 
down by the chosen remote support, the assignment of property is restricted by the 
chosen value proposition, auxiliary functions inherit the “responsibility for service 
provision” of the related main function, etc.  
3.4 
CASD – Modeling Services during the Domain-Specific Detailing of PSS 
The standardized modeling of manual, remote-supported and automated services is 
aimed at during the domain-specific detailing. Thereby, CASD particularly contri-
butes to the efficient and effective design of heterogeneous services.  
A manual service is modeled with the aid of the following modeling elements: one 
or several process steps, connecting elements (and/or/xor) as well as one or several 
human, technical resources and information, which are directly assigned to a specific 
process step. In this regard, the value proposition chosen during the PSS-concept 
development automatically restricts whether a particular service resource is to be 
supplied by the PSS-provider or its customer. Moreover, specific personnel qualifica-
tion and competence profiles are modeled. Thereby, the heterogeneity of service ac-
tors is specifically taken into account. The related product, process or person which 
has been chosen during the PSS-concept development can be detailed as well. That

way, specific characteristics of the product/process/person in question, which may 
influence the service provision, can be systematically archived.  
In the context of remote-supported services, the remote support as well as the  
actual service provision are modeled simultaneously. In principle, the initially intro-
duced modeling elements are similarly used, but it is differentiated between the pers-
pective of the customer and the point of view of the provider. As a result, additional 
costs for the required remote support are made transparent. 
Automated services are modeled with the aid of the following modeling elements: 
critical values, critical rules and critical actions. A critical value defines a maximum 
permissible value of a certain state variable. Such a variable is used to define a partic-
ular machine’s behavior. A critical rule describes the relation between a critical value 
and a critical action. It determines which action results from exceeding a certain criti-
cal value. A critical action defines the specific action which is to be carried out if a 
critical value has been exceeded. With the aid of the developed notation it is aimed at 
the systematic consolidation and archiving of know-how related to the automated 
condition monitoring of machines.

CASD – Software Prototype  
The proposed software prototype has been programmed according to the model-view-
controller design pattern. The view itself follows the standards for “design criteria for 
physical input devices” of DIN 9241-410. In order to develop a valid software proto-
type, all theoretical explanations have been formalized with the aid of entity-
relationship models and UML-class diagrams. Figure 3 presents screenshots of the 
implemented prototype.

Conclusion 
This paper introduces Computer-aided Service Design (CASD) as an efficient and 
effective tool for the integration of heterogeneous service information during the de-
velopment of Product-Service Systems. It has highlighted considerable benefits of 
CASD such as plausibility checks with regard to service contents, the automatic gen-
eration of diverse service information during the PSS-concept development, the  
standardized modeling of services and the automatic generation of service costs and 
time during the domain-specific detailing of PSS. Thereby, it has been possible to 
successfully close existing gaps in research. Moreover, a revised form of the concept 
service has been introduced in chapter 2 of this paper. Thereby the “design object” 
service has been specified within the scope of CASD.

Abstract. Artificial lighting is responsible for between 20 to 45% of the total 
electricity demand in office buildings. The energy efficiency of lighting systems 
can be improved by replacing existing installations with the best available tech-
nology and by implementing lighting control systems. The deployment of these 
technical solutions should be based on a sound business model. Traditionally, 
lighting systems are sold as products, but a promising alternative is offered by 
Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), whereby energy efficiency projects are 
developed, installed and financed over a period of several years. This article ar-
gues that ESCO-offerings should be regarded as a special case of PSS, and pro-
vides a novel characterization method for ESCOs for office lighting, that allows 
to unambiguously describe existing ESCO types. The outline and results of a 
quantitative analysis of the economic potential of an ESCO for office lighting 
are presented and interpreted.

Introduction 
Artificial lighting is responsible for between 20 to 45% of the total electricity demand 
in commercial buildings [1, 2]. A reduction of at least 50% is deemed feasible [1], 
and can be realized through the implementation of a diverse set of measures, includ-
ing on the one hand the replacement of lighting systems (luminaires, lamps and bal-
lasts) by the best available technology, and on the other hand the implementation of 
lighting control systems (e.g. application of daylight harvesting, occupancy or time 
control). In promoting these energy-efficiency improvements, there is a need for a 
viable business model. Traditionally, lighting systems and lighting control systems 
are sold as products, in a production-based economic model. The prevalence of this 
business model limits the uptake of the best available technology, especially for exist-
ing installations, since customers often have no knowledge about the potential im-
provements and lack access to the required capital. A promising alternative is offered 
by a performance-based rationale [3], whereby lighting systems and lighting control 
systems are sold under energy performance contracts [4]. A key role is foreseen for so 
called Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), companies typically engaged in develop-
ing, installing and financing performance-based projects, centered around the im-
provement of the energy efficiency of facilities [5]. In the case of office buildings, an 
ESCO will implement energy efficiency improvements (e.g. lighting renovation and 

562 
J. Van Ostaeyen, H. Vanhees, and J.R. Duflou 
 
lighting control), assume (part of) the performance, energy price variation and financ-
ing risks during a certain fixed or variable contract period and will obtain revenue 
based on the actual energy savings realized during that period.  
In the specialized literature, several definitions and classifications of ESCOs are 
provided [5-8]. They have drawn criticism for their lack of consistency and clarity in 
describing different ESCO types [9]. In essence, the term ‘ESCO’ refers to a type of 
business model, a business model being a ‘representation of a firm’s underlying core 
logic and strategic choices for creating and capturing value within a value network’ 
[10]. Business models can be characterized by specifying the different building blocks 
that constitute them. Examples are the popular business model canvas of Osterwalder 
[11], with nine building blocks, and the representation proposed in reference [12], 
whereby business models for investment goods are represented in a structure with 
four domains and twelve building blocks. But in order to highlight the core characte-
ristics of a certain ESCO, a comprehensive description of all of these building blocks 
is not required. Based on a review of the available descriptions of ESCO models (e.g. 
in references [6], [7] and [8]), the following main characterizing features of an ESCO 
were determined: 
• The value offering of the ESCO (i.e. which products and services it offers) 
• The revenue mechanism(s) of the ESCO (i.e. according to which logic it generates 
revenues from its offering) 
• The way risks are assigned between the involved stakeholders (the main stakehold-
ers involving the ESCO, the end user, plus potentially an external financing organ-
ization and other intermediaries) 
Since the value offering of an ESCO is essentially an integration of products and ser-
vices, whereby the focus is on value-in-use and not so much on exchange value, it is 
evident that the value offering of an ESCO can be seen as a special case of a Product-
Service System (PSS), specifically applied within the energy sector. Therefore, the 
representation method and typology developed in reference [13] can be applied for 
the specific case of ESCOs. 
This article proposes a novel way of characterizing ESCOs for office lighting, 
based on a description of the three main building blocks identified above. This is ela-
borated in Section 2. In Section 3, insight is provided on the economic potential of an 
ESCO business model for office lighting through an extensive Monte Carlo simula-
tion of a lighting system's life cycle costs. The focus of this study is on lighting appli-
cations in Belgian offices. In Section 4, the main conclusions are stated.

ESCO Business Model Characterization 
In this section, a new way for characterizing ESCO models for office lighting is pro-
vided, based on a description of the value offering (Subsection 2.1), revenue mechan-
ism (Subsection 2.2) and the distribution of the main risks within the ESCO model 
(Subsection 2.3).

2.1 
Value Offering of an ESCO for Office Lighting 
ESCOs offer an integrated combination of products and services that delivers value in 
use, specifically in the energy sector. In the specific case of lighting systems for office 
buildings, the ESCO offering contains a specific set of product and service compo-
nents. The possible components are represented in Figure 1. A further partitioning of 
these components is still possible, e.g. the lighting system can be divided into lumi-
naires, lamps and ballasts. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Product and Service components that can be part of the offering of an ESCO for office 
lighting (products components: white, service components: gray)  
Thus, the offering of an ESCO for office lighting will always be a combination of 
(some of) the product and service components defined above. In combining these 
products and services, some of them can be integrated in an ‘integrated offering’ (vi-
sually, this is represented by joining the rectangles). This means that they will always 
be sold together and have a common revenue generation mechanism. As such, the 
complete offering of an ESCO can have a combination of different revenue mechan-
ism, one for each integrated combination of products and services. The possible types 
of revenue mechanisms are presented in the next subsection. 
2.2 
Revenue Mechanisms  
Different types of revenue mechanisms can be discerned (cfr. [13]), based on the de-
gree of performance orientation: 
1. An input-based (IB) revenue mechanism means that revenue is transferred from the 
customer to the provider according to the inputs delivered to effectuate the function 
of a product or service. In case of a product, this means that the property rights of 
the products (e.g. lamps, luminaires, sensors, …) are transferred to the customer 
and revenue for these products is generated at the moment of property transfer. For 
a service, this means that revenue is generated per intervention, based on the re-
sources necessary to deliver the service, such as labor hours or materials.

2. An availability-based (AB) revenue mechanism means that revenue is transferred 
from the customer to the provider based on the time period during which the prod-
uct or service are available for the customer, independent of how much they are ac-
tually being consumed during that period. For a product this means for example a 
monthly rental or leasing fee and for a service this means a fixed monthly sum to 
be paid for which the provider promises to deliver the service to the customer 
whenever necessary.  
3. A usage-based (UB) revenue mechanism means that revenue is generated only dur-
ing the actual usage of the product or service. Usage can be expressed in time units 
(in the case of office lighting: the number of hours that there is a lighting demand).  
4. A performance-based (PB) revenue mechanism means that revenue is generated 
based on the functional performance of the product or service. Functional perfor-
mance can be related to the main customer demands that the product or service 
aims to fulfill. The main customer demands for a lighting system are twofold: it 
should provide visual comfort and the user should be able to control the usage 
costs. In between these demands and the product and service elements of Figure 1, 
the functions of these elements can be expressed on different levels of abstraction 
[13]. On the lowest level of abstraction, the functions are expressed in terms of pa-
rameters of a specific solution (e.g. ‘Generate luminous flux’, expressed in lumen). 
On a higher level of abstraction, the functions are expressed in terms of effect on 
the environment (e.g. ‘Provide illuminance of a task area’, expressed in lux), and 
on the highest level of abstraction the function is directly expressed in terms of the 
subjective demand that is to be fulfilled (‘Provide visual comfort’). Thus, three 
subtypes of performance based revenue mechanisms can be discerned [11]:  
─ Solution-oriented performance based (PB-SO) revenue mechanism 
─ Effect-oriented performance based (PB-EO) revenue mechanism  
─ Demand fulfillment-oriented performance based (PB-DO) revenue mechanism  
The different types of revenue mechanisms for the specific case of office lighting are 
indicated in Figure 2, organized according to the two main customer demands. The 
reason why there is no demand-fulfillment oriented revenue model for the ‘control 
costs’ demand is that this would have to be expressed in terms of the subjective ap-
preciation of costs, which is not a practical concept. All the other options are (theoret-
ical) possibilities that indicate on which basis lighting (control) systems could be sold. 
From Figure 2 it becomes clear that, apart from the business models that are tradition-
ally regarded as ESCO models (on the right hand side, related to the customer demand 
‘control costs’), different theoretical ESCO models also exist on the left hand side of 
the figure, related to the customer demand ‘provide visual comfort’. Since the revenue 
models on the right hand side are more prevalent for existing ESCOs, in the remaind-
er of this article they will be the main focus.

2.3 
Risk Allocation within the ESCO 
The way the main risks are distributed is an essential characteristic of an ESCO mod-
el. There are three main risks involved: 
• The risk of variation of the energy price. Since ESCO contracts are running over a 
period of several years, and the variation of the energy price over these years is un-
certain, this risk will exist in every possible ESCO model. In case a PB-EO reve-
nue mechanism is chosen, whereby the ESCO is paid a fixed percentage of the  
actual monetary savings in energy cost until the end of the contract period, the risk 
is shared between the customer and the ESCO. In case the PB-SO revenue mechan-
ism is chosen, whereby the ESCO is paid a fixed sum per saved kWh of energy, 
this risk is completely allocated to the customer.  
• The performance risk. This risk is related to the system's ability to achieve the 
stated savings. In most ESCO models, this risk is primarily assigned to the ESCO 
itself, since this gives the ESCO the right incentives to optimize the performance of 
the system delivered.  
• The credit risk. This is the financial risk related to the possibility to recover in-
vested funds. It depends on which party does the investments in the equipment. 
Credit risk depends on the salvage value of a system being offered that is being 
used as a lien for acquiring the necessary financing. In case the customer would 
terminate the activities in the building where the lighting (control) systems are be-
ing employed and would fail to commit to the contract agreements, it is difficult – 
if not impossible – to take the lighting components out of this building and put 
them into service elsewhere, since the labor costs for removing and re-installing 
the equipment are prohibitive. This is different for equipment that is more mobile 
(e.g. a mobile construction machine, such as a bulldozer or portable compressor, 
that can in most cases easily be transported and put into operation elsewhere). 
Therefore, the credit risk will be considerable in the case of office lighting (con-
trol) systems.  

566

Apart from these risks, another important characteristic is the contract term in 
which the ESCO operates. It can be fixed or variable [7, 14]. In general, if the con-
tract term is longer, the three relevant risks will be considered to be larger. For exam-
ple, in what is known as a ‘First-Out’ ESCO model, whereby the ESCO invests in the 
energy saving technology and is paid the full energy savings benefits until an agreed 
sum is acquired [15], the contract term is shorter than in case the ESCO gets for ex-
ample 60% of the real cost savings for a fixed contract period (this last model being 
known in literature as the ‘Shared Savings’ ESCO model [15]), and the three risks for 
the ESCO will be larger for the latter model.  
2.4 
Characterization of ESCO Models: 2 Examples 
ESCO models can be characterized by the features discussed in the previous subsec-
tions. Since going through all the main ESCO types is not feasible within the scope of 
this paper, two ESCO types are described in detail, for the specific situation of office 
lighting: the Shared Savings type and the Guaranteed Savings type. The value offer-
ing and corresponding revenue models of both types are visualized in Figure 3. 
This visualization can be interpreted as follows. For the Shared Savings type, the in-
vestment in materials (i.e. LC and LS) are performed by the ESCO and not arranged by 
the customer, as is the case in a Guaranteed Savings type. This is indicated on the left 
hand side of Figure 3: for the Shared Savings type the product components are integrated 
with the service components and all are sold according to a common performance-based 
revenue mechanism (i.e. an effect-oriented model (PB-EO), such as defined in Subsec-
tion 2.2 and Figure 2). For the Guaranteed Savings type only most of the service compo-
nents are integrated in a solution-oriented revenue mechanism (price per kWh saved 
above a certain threshold). Ambiguity exists in the literature on ESCOs on whether the 
ESCO receives a fixed payment per saved kWh above the threshold or whether the 
ESCO receives the actual cost savings above the kWh threshold. In this article, the Guar-
anteed Savings type is restricted to the first interpretation.  
The comparison in risks and contract terms between both models is given in  
Table 1. The main difference lies in the allocation of the credit risk. Since the contract 
period is longer for the Guaranteed Savings type, the performance risk for the ESCO 
is larger (stated as ‘high’, ‘medium’ or ‘low’). According to the interpretation of 
Guaranteed Savings chosen in this article, the energy risk is completely for the cus-
tomer’s account  and mainly for the ESCO in the Shared Savings model.

The other ESCO types that occur in practice can also be described by the characte-
rization method introduced in this section, which allows for a comprehensive and 
unambiguous description of ESCOs. This contributes to a better understanding of the 
specific characteristics of ESCO types.

Quantitative Analysis of the Economic Potential of an ESCO 
for Office Lighting 
The economic potential of an ESCO business model for office lighting has been ana-
lyzed, based on a comprehensive Life Cycle Cost simulation model. The basic research 
goal was to establish the conditions under which an ESCO could be profitable in replac-
ing existing lighting systems by state-of-the-art luminaire, lamp and ballast technology 
and/or by implementing advanced lighting control strategies. Several base scenarios and 
improvement scenarios were identified, and the cost improvement potential has been 
quantified of certain improvement scenarios over a certain base case. Furthermore, a 
sensitivity analysis has been performed on the results, in order to define the key success 

568

factors for ESCO profitability. In Subsection 3.1, the outline of the method is described. 
Subsection 3.2 summarizes the results obtained within this study. 
3.1 
Method Description 
The modeling approach used is a Monte Carlo simulation of the Life Cycle Cost 
(LCC), whereby the uncertainty and variability in the input parameters was modeled 
by using appropriate statistical distributions and thus obtaining the output distribution 
of the Life Cycle Cost. The general structure of the method is depicted in the flow-
chart of Figure 4. The model generates cellular offices (< 40 m²) and open plan offic-
es (> 40 m²) with variable size and usage patterns. The design of the lighting system 
is based on the lumen method (e.g. described in [16]), whereby a luminaire layout is 
calculated from a required illuminance level of task areas according to the European  
standard EN12464, assuming a depreciation of the lighting system over its mainten-
ance cycle (represented by a maintenance factor) and a lighting efficiency represented 
by a utilization factor, which is determined by the European standard EN13032. The 
maintenance factor and utilization factor assume information about the selected lumi-
naire-lamp-ballast (LLB) combination. In this research a pool of 26 LLB combina-
tions, representative for the lighting systems installed in European offices, and 6 best 
available technology (BAT) LLB combinations are adopted from a study on the Bel-
gian office lighting market [17]. The design of the lighting control system is based on 
European standard EN15193, whereby the formulas in that standard are applied to

estimate the savings from dimming to a maintained illuminance as a function of the 
maintenance factor, the savings from occupancy control and the savings from  
daylight control. The maintenance parameters represent periodic group lamp re-
placements and the installation parameters represent the installation times of the 
components of a lighting system. The supplier parameters contain labor costs and 
discount rates. All input parameters are modeled according to a uniform or PERT 
distribution and were determined by eliciting expert information from a range of 
stakeholders (e.g. an electrical installation company, a lighting control systems pro-
vider, a lighting technology specialist). The model output is the LCC of the lighting 
system, expressed as the Net Present Value of the aggregated installation, energy, 
maintenance and removal costs of luminaires, lamps, ballasts, cabling and lighting 
control system components over a period of 20 years.

Analysis of the potential of a new lighting system with automatic daylight 
control, automatic presence control and dimming to constant illuminance 
w.r.t. the base case scenario 
Some of the main findings are: 
• Determination of base case and best available technology (BAT) scenario. The 
base case and best available technology scenarios were determined by calculating 
the Normalized Power Density (NPD) of a lighting system for the different LLB 
combinations of reference [17]. The NPD is a measure of the efficiency to illumi-
nate a specific task area [18]. This analysis defined 5 out of 26 LLB combinations 
as energy inefficient, i.e. they represent on average a higher NPD, expressed in

W/m².100 lux. One LLB combination was defined as the best available technology, 
with a low NPD and a ballast type that allows for the implementation of a lighting 
control system.  
• The potential of replacing base case scenarios with BAT. The potential was deter-
mined to replace the lighting systems in a building in one of the 5 base case scena-
rios with the BAT scenario of Analysis 2, with manual control. The key finding is 
that the potential is there for open plan offices (potential of on average between 0 
and 15 €/m², taking into account a discount rate of 10%) and that the savings in 
energy and maintenance costs for cellular offices are smaller than the higher in-
vestment required. The key success factor determining the profitability of an ESCO 
model is the room index, which is defined as the ratio of the horizontal and the ver-
tical area of the room. In Figure 5, the sensitivity of the net cost savings of invest-
ing in the best available technology in €/m² is shown in function of the room index. 
As can be seen, for a room index higher than 1.4, the investments in BAT becomes 
profitable.

best available technology in function of the room index 
• The potential of automatic lighting control. The potential was determined for ana-
lyses 3 to 6. An upgrade of a base case scenario to a new lighting system with au-
tomatic daylight and presence control and dimming to constant illuminance is the 
most profitable investment in open plan offices with a potential ranging from 5 to 
20 €/m² over the lifecycle of the lighting system or a discounted payback period 
ranging from 10 to 17 years depending on the base case scenario. The investment 
in cellular offices is not profitable due to the geometry of the offices (i.e. the room 
index). A sensitivity analysis determined the most important factors for the profita-
bility of an ESCO model that would apply scenario 6 in open plan offices: the

room index, the type of luminaire (more specifically its downward light output ra-
tio DLOR [16], which has a major impact on the utilization factor) and to a lesser 
extent the discount rate and the energy price. This indicates that the performance 
risk is dominant and that it mainly depends on the choice of the base case.  
Therefore, an ESCO should carefully consider which buildings it chooses for im-
plementation of an energy saving project. Out of the existing building stock of 
Belgian offices described in reference [17], it was determined that an investment in 
energy-efficient lighting systems can be profitable in 10.8% of the Belgian offices. 
Offices with a room index above 1.4 have a potential of 5-20 €/m² over the life-
cycle of the lighting system and a discounted payback period of 10-17 years.

Conclusions, Limitations and Future Research 
This article argues that ESCOs can be considered as the application of the PSS con-
cept in the energy industry. A novel method for characterizing ESCO models, based 
on a representation method and typology of PSS has been proposed. This allows for a 
comprehensive and unambiguous representation of the essential characteristics of a 
certain ESCO type.  
Apart from this qualitative description, the outlines of a quantitative study have 
been proposed wherein the potential of an ESCO for office lighting was determined 
for the Belgian office market. The analysis of the potential of the investment in ener-
gy efficient lighting systems with several lighting control options pointed out that an 
ESCO should focus on upgrading the lighting systems of open plan offices by instal-
ling new energy efficient lighting systems with automated daylight and presence con-
trol and dimming to a constant illuminance. It also highlighted that the ESCO should 
choose with great care the type of lighting systems that are to be replaced, since these 
parameters are dominant in determining the profitability of the investments. 
The main limitation of this study is its high reliance on the description of the base 
case scenarios of reference [17]. Recommendations for future study are to validate the 
results of this study with other data concerning the current situation in European of-
fices. This could lead to a new pool of representative luminaires used in offices that 
can be used as input for the model. Furthermore, the profitability of the different 
ESCO types (such as the Shared Savings and Guaranteed Savings type) could also be 
compared more in detail, whereas the profitability potential of an ESCO as presented 
here is stated independently of the specific type of ESCO applied.

Abstract. In order to remain competitive, IPS² providers have to react flexibly 
to changes which are caused by environmental dynamics and the long duration 
of the business relationship. To ensure this, the provider can provision flexibili-
ty either by short-term or long-term actions which differently affect the IPS² 
profitability. Accordingly, the paper at hand focuses on two research questions: 
1) How can the provider estimate the economic effects of short-term and long-
term flexibility measures? 2) How do these measures influence the dynamics of 
IPS² business models? To answer these questions, the authors use the approach 
of System Dynamics (SD) and illustrate the economic effects of integrating 
flexibility in the IPS² business model. A conceptual case study of a German so-
lution provider is presented to exemplarily show how decision support is pro-
vided by SD. 
Keywords: IPS² flexibility, decision support, IPS² business model.

Introduction 
An IPS² (Industrial Product-Service System) results from a systematic configuration 
of integratively developed [1-2] and reciprocally substitutable product and service 
modules [1]. It is a holistic and customer-specific problem solution without the neces-
sity to transfer the ownership of the product [3]. In competition, IPS² represent a  
sustainable success factor in a market environment where achieving competitive ad-
vantages just through products is becoming a constant challenge for most of the com-
panies [4].  
IPS² are usually delivered within long-term business relationships in which uncer-
tainty has to be considered [5]. In this article, risk and uncertainty are used as syn-
onyms. They refer to the possibility that deviations from the business relationship’s 
objectives can occur [6-7]. Further, risks arise due to insufficient information about 
future events within the relevant system boundary [8]. The dynamics of IPS² business 
relationships make it difficult to anticipate future, environmental events [5] and the 

574 
H. Meier et al. 
 
future behavior of the counterpart [6]. The long duration of the relationship enhances 
the degree of difficulty in anticipating the future regarding both environmental and 
behavioral perspectives. It increases the probability of changes and requires resche-
duling efforts. Flexibility is considered as an appropriate way to deal with uncertainty 
and to keep the IPS² performance at a high level [5].  
In addition, managers have to understand how to deal with uncertainty and how to 
ensure profitability in these dynamic IPS² business relationships, especially with re-
spect to the economic effects of provisioning flexibility. In order to react flexibly to 
changes, the provider has to keep resources available without really being sure wheth-
er these will be used actually. Flexibility can be provisioned by either short-term or 
long-term measures which differently affect the economical advantageousness of an 
IPS². According to that, two research questions are to be answered:  
1. How can the provider estimate the economic effects of short-term and long-term 
flexibility measures? 
2. How do these measures influence the dynamics of IPS² business models? 
In the literature, there are various approaches which deal with business dynamics and 
associated uncertainties (see sections 2 and 3). Despite that, specific characteristics of 
IPS² are not taken into account by these approaches. To fill this research gap, a con-
ceptual case study of a hypothetic solution provider’s business model is introduced. 
Finally, several simulation runs of selected scenarios are accomplished for strategic 
decision support. The authors use the method of SD to illustrate complex feedback 
structures which have to be considered for strategic decision making.

2.1 
IPS² Business Model 
The heterogeneous understanding of the business model concept results in a relatively 
unstructured discussion in the engineering and economic literature [9]. An IPS² busi-
ness model has to vary according to the dynamics of an IPS², e.g. as caused by a 
change of the customer’s requirement and hence, the underlying product-service 
combination. Teece (2010) defines a business model in a more static approach as “the 
design or architecture of the value creation, delivery and capture mechanism em-
ployed. The essence of a business model is that it crystallizes customers’ needs and 
ability to pay, defines the manner by which the business enterprise responds to and 
delivers value to customers, entices customers to pay for value, and converts those 
payments to profit through the proper design and operation of the various elements of 
the value chain” [10]. In the context of dynamic IPS² it has to be considered that an 
IPS² is always an individual solution for a customer which is tailored for a specific 
situation. Thus, in the majority of cases, an IPS² is unique. Taking into account these 
IPS²-specific aspects, this definition can be expanded by adding the fact that every 
customer-provider relationship is characterized by one specific business model [9], 
while other value-adding partners can also be involved (e.g. suppliers) [11].

2.2 
IPS² Life Cycle 
The provision of customer value over the entire life cycle is a central aspect of IPS². 
Accordingly, they must adapt dynamically to changing customer requirements. Deal-
ing with uncertainty, in terms of high complexity and dynamics, is thus one of the key 
challenges while provisioning flexibility. The IPS² life cycle is divided into five phas-
es. In the planning phase, the customer requirements have to be identified and corres-
pondingly the contract has to be designed. In the development phase, the provider 
specifies the solution in close collaboration with the customer. The implementation 
phase includes the allocation of the physical artifacts of the IPS² and the provision of 
service capacities in order to operate the IPS² within the operation phase subsequent-
ly. Finally, in the closure phase, the contractual business relationship ends [12-13]. 
2.3 
Integration of Flexibility 
In order to deal with uncertainty, an IPS² has to be flexible [5], [7]. Flexibility poten-
tials are to be taken into account at the beginning of the business relationship, i.e. in 
the planning and the development phase. IPS² flexibility is separated into internal and 
external flexibility [14]. The external flexibility is subdivided into primary and sec-
ondary flexibility. It is broken down according to the relationship development and 
contractual agreements. The primary flexibility refers to the provider’s abilities and 
capabilities to fulfill the customer’s requirements at the planning phase. Examples for 
this category are the provision of financing or of personnel if the customer does not 
have these resources available. Thus, the primary flexibility is necessary to build the 
business relationship. The secondary flexibility refers to options that can be used in 
further steps of the relationship if requirements change. There are two possibilities for 
reaching agreements relating to the options. 
An ex ante contractual agreement, i.e. at the planning and development phase, sim-
plifies the calculation from the provider’s point of view. In this context, the long-term 
engagement of new staff can be seen as an example. In the case of an ex post agree-
ment, a lack of staff eventually causes production stops, which result in performance 
losses and increased redesign costs, respectively [14]. Consequently, the cost and 
revenue effects of provisioning flexibility depend on the time of the agreement, too.  
The internal flexibility concerns the provider’s abilities and capabilities to react 
flexibly to the customer requirements in a concrete IPS² relationship as well as in all 
IPS² relationships the provider is involved in. The external and the internal flexibility 
overlap if a certain IPS² is considered. Thus, the provider’s investments in flexibility 
potentials for a certain IPS² can positively impact the overall, internal flexibility. 
There are three factors [15] which determine the internal flexibility, i.e. human re-
sources, structural resources and relational resources. Human resources (HR) include, 
for example, know-how, competencies, qualification etc. In addition, HR include 
personalized knowledge of employees. Structural resources (SR) refer to issues such 
as the quantity of employees (especially service personnel), technical equipment, 
transportation fleet, communication structures etc. [16-17]. Finally, the provider needs 
relational resources (RR). For example, solid relationships with investors and with 
cooperation partners or suppliers [16] are necessary, in order to ensure the provider’s 
competitiveness in the long-term [15], [18].

Case Study 
In this section, a conceptual case study from the field of micro production is intro-
duced in order to demonstrate in section 4 the economic effects of provisioning flex-
ibility within the IPS² business model. This case study serves two major objectives. 
First, is to evaluate the profitability of this business model with short-term and long-
term flexibility measures. Second, is to analyze by means of SD the influence of the 
mentioned flexibility measures on the chosen IPS² business model.  
 
Fig. 1. Iterative process for case study analysis  
In order to achieve these objectives, three steps are necessary which form an itera-
tive process. After problem articulation and risk identification (step 1, see Figure 1), 
the relevant partial models are selected considering the risk distribution (step 2, see 
Figure 2). Based on case-specific key data, a series of simulation runs is performed 
(step 3, see Figure 3) by means of the SD approach to support the management’s de-
cision process in finding an adequate strategy for the sustainable implementation of a 
customer-specific business model and the corresponding flexibility options.  
SD is a method to enhance learning and understanding of complex socio-technical 
systems, especially in a complex business environment [19], and is thus a suitable tool 
for analyzing IPS² and their business models [13]. It is based on simple graphical 
notations to model systems: causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams. Ster-
man, Morecroft and Warren give a detailed introduction and critical analysis to the 
use of SD with special focus on business dynamics, strategic modeling and manage-
ment dynamics [19-21]. On this basis, Meier introduces an integrated business model 
design and engineering approach for IPS² business models using SD [22]. 
The respective company is a solution provider (SP) in the field of micro milling 
machines and has currently more than 20 running IPS² contracts in Germany. Thus, 
SP is a well-established provider focusing on long-term customer relationships and an 
integrated development of product and service offers. An interview with the customer 
(C), a German manufacturer of watches in the medium-price segment, revealed that C

requires a specific micro milling machine to produce high-quality watch movements 
for chronographs in the high-price segment. Up to now, C has externally purchased 
standard watch movements to produce watches for the medium-price segment. Thus, 
a differentiation from competitors has only been possible through design aspects. 
From now on, the top management of C additionally aims at expanding the product 
portfolio by high-quality watches. Hence, it must be assured that core competencies 
for this new segment can be provided in a long-term perspective.

Performance Modeling and Evaluation 
4.1 
Problem Articulation and Risk Identification 
In order to further specify the customer-specific solution, a second interview was 
conducted in which SP and C interacted intensively for analyzing the current  
requirements.  
 
Fig. 2. Uncertainty map 
The business partners used the uncertainty map (see Figure 2) to identify and de-
scribe relevant uncertainties and risks which determine the IPS² performance [23-25]. 
The uncertainty map helps to structure the problem situation. It includes four sources 
of uncertainty [7], i.e. the customer’s firm, the market, the provider’s firm and legal 
requirements. The arrows pointing inward indicate the influence of each source whe-
reas the arrows pointing outward illustrate each business partner’s performance tasks. 
The tasks are distributed based on competence analyses and on available resources. 
The modules that are linked to the market are to be delivered by the provider’s coop-
eration partners. This attribution has not to be addressed in customer interaction. The 
explanation is only for the sake of completeness.  
As shown in Figure 2, the uncertainty map focuses on the simplified IPS² product 
model [26]. The respective IPS² includes two hybrid modules (surrounded module 
couples), two pure service modules and one pure product module.

Fig. 3. Gradual business model adaptation 
Base Scenario. Uncertainties resulting from C’s firm include know-how deficits in 
dealing with the micro milling machine, lack of finances and of personnel. Therefore, 
SP recommends a gradual business model adaptation that begins with a result-
oriented value proposition (see Figure 3, t0 – t2) in order to prepare C to develop core 
competencies over time. Hence, SP bears to a certain extent the market risks of the 
customer due to the result-oriented revenue generation. Once C has gathered know-
how and core-competencies in the movement production process, a change to the 
availability-oriented revenue model occurs (see Figure 3, t2 – t3) as contractually 
agreed upon. In this collaboration-intense business model, SP does not have to bear 
the market risks anymore, but the coordination necessities within the business rela-
tionship are higher due to the high degree of interaction between both partners [9], 
e.g. SP is responsible for services to ensure availability and C runs the production 
process. Furthermore, C’s market situation is characterized by volatile demand. Due 
to the high demand for the high-quality watches, the SP’s personnel capacities are 
running close to full capacity. Finally, there are not any uncertainties regarding legal 
requirements. Based on the uncertainties mentioned, flexibility options are contrac-
tually agreed upon (see Figure 4). Internal flexibility options are in the focus of this 
investigation (see Figure 4, printed in bold). 
Flexibility Options. In order to establish the business relationship, SP offers the op-
tions 1-3 which are components of a result-oriented value proposition. For being flex-
ible in case of increased demand, optional automation by the use of robots is agreed 
contractually. From SP’s perspective, internal flexibility is required to satisfy the 
demand for micro milling machines. To build internal flexibility, two options are 
possible (see Figure 4): 
1. SP can hire temporary workers (T), train them and provide them to C for a certain 
price (hiring and training costs), even after t3 (scenario I). 
2. The second option is a long-term capacity enlargement (overlapping of external 
and internal flexibility). According to that, SP hires employees for the long-run 
and can use them for other IPS², too, when C’s need for personnel decreases 
(scenario II).  
After t3, a transition to a function-oriented value proposition would be possible (see 
Figure 3, t3 – t4). In the interests of clarity and rationality, this business model, which 
is commonly used in practice and thus a minor research aspect for IPS² [9], is not part 
of the developed SD model.

Qualitative Mapping and Risk Analysis 
In this section, the dynamic behavior in the case being considered is examined within 
two scenarios by means of SD which result from the two flexibility options mentioned 
above. A key aspect within these workforce-driven options is the development of core 
competencies and knowledge over time.

state of a system and generate the necessary information for decision support. They 
are represented by a rectangle. Inflows are represented by a pipe pointing into the 
stock. Outflows are represented by a pipe pointing out of the stock. Flow rates are 
represented by a valve on a double line and are necessary to control the flows. Clouds 
represent the sources and sinks for the flows and thus the model boundary [19], [27].  
New and experienced employees within the aging chain model (see Figure 5) have 
a different performance depending on their know-how level. Team performance is 
simply the sum of each category working at its own performance. These basic con-
structions are fundamental for modeling the organizational partial models for the 
workforce of SP, C and T. 
In order to perform a scenario analysis, quantitative modeling is necessary. There-
fore, feedback processes between the identified risks, planned flexibility options and 
other factors affected have to be described by various stock-flow diagrams structured 
in IPS²-specific partial models (value architecture, result- and availability-based reve-
nue streams, cost structure and organization). 
Figure 6 depicts the most important aspects of this investigation within a simplified 
version of the partial model value architecture (production of movement plates for 
C’s high-quality watches). The completion rate of the production process is depen-
dent on the overall team FTE (full time equivalent) and the effort per order. In addi-
tion, there is a differentiation of the output in accepted units for final assembly and 
rejected units, which are dependent from the error rate closely linked to the variable 
relative work pressure. 
4.3 
Scenario Analysis by means of Quantitative Modeling 
In the base scenario (see section 4.1) the IPS² business model is gradually adapted 
over the lifecycle as contractually agreed upon without any problems. The partial 
model value architecture (see Figure 6) is connected to two further partial models: 
revenue generation and cost structure.  
Within the partial model for revenue generation, the gradual business model adap-
tation is also considered by two different revenue constructions (result-based and 
availability-based). The result-based part is based on accepted units. The availability-
based part is based on OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) which is calculated by 
multiplying the quality, performance and availability index. The used model structure 
can be found in [13], [22]. Figure 7 shows the resulting cumulative net operating 
result (black solid line) over time of the business relationship for the base scenario. 
In a threat scenario, SP faces the problem of workforce shortage due to an unex-
pected increasing quit rate of SP’s employees. As a result, there is a decline in the 
cumulative net operating results due to losses in year 2 (phase t1 – t2). 
Figure 7 shows the respective curve characteristics (gray solid line). Hence, flex-
ibility is necessary which can be realized by means of the above mentioned two op-
tions. Within these two options, the gradual business model adaptation has also been 
agreed on by analogy to the base scenario.

Fig. 7. Cumulative net operating result based on scenarios and flexibility options 
Aiming at flexible employment contracts, SP has the possibility to decide for op-
tion 6, i.e. the use of T. Thereby, the quality management realizes in t1 a relatively 
high reject rate (quality control). A detailed cause analysis reveals that the high work 
pressure involves carelessness and de-motivation. Within the model, the relative work 
pressure increases which results in a correspondingly higher error rate T. Hence, the 
amount of accepted units is reduced as well. On the one hand, this results in a decline 
of result-based revenue. On the other hand, there is an increase of costs caused by a 
higher reject rate. The gray dotted line in Figure 7 illustrates the course of the result-
ing cumulative net operating profit. Within the scope of option 7, SP can decide for a 
strategic capacity enlargement in order to be flexible in the long-run. On the one 
hand, this causes hiring and training costs which decrease the rate of return in short-
run. On the other hand, this measure produces also an increase in the net operating 
result (see Figure 7, gray dashed line) in the long-run due to a higher productivity and 
an increasing quality rate. As a result, option 7 is the better strategy in dealing with 
the threat scenario.

Summary and Further Research 
For an IPS² provider it is extremely important to estimate the economic effects of 
provisioning flexibility which is needed to deal with uncertainty and to ensure profit-
ability in complex and dynamic IPS² business relationships. Since the provider has 
different possibilities for building flexibility, i.e. through short-term and long-term 
measures, decision support is necessary to evaluate the economic effects of these 
measures. In order to ensure this evaluation, complexity reduction as well as the con-
sideration of IPS²-specific decision parameters is indispensable to support decision 
making within complex IPS² business relationships. Therefore, methods such as SD 
have to be consistently applied in order to examine all relevant interdependencies and 
feedback structures within the respective IPS² business model.

Modeling of Flexibility within Dynamic IPS² Business Models

Accordingly, the authors present a modeling and simulation approach which com-
prises important feedback structures of the value architecture of a solution provider’s 
business model. The presented procedure of qualitative mapping clearly shows that 
the consistent use of SD simplifies this dynamic complexity. By defining flexibility 
options which imply various scenarios, quantitative modeling is introduced. On this 
basis, the resulting revenue streams and the cost structure are derived in order to es-
tablish various scenario simulations focusing on the cumulative net operating result as 
an indicator for the success of the respective business model scenario.  
Nevertheless, it is still unclear, how to convince a customer of the advantages of a 
specific business model configuration. Consequently, further research has to pay  
attention to using the presented approach for communicating the different effects 
resulting from flexibility measures in order to raise the customer’s awareness for in-
vestments in flexibility at an early stage. The visualization of the consequences of 
choosing a flexibility option offers opportunities to assure the costumer in invest-
ments. This can help if the customer tends to choose external, ex post flexibility. In 
this case, the objective of the communication is to convince the customer of ex ante 
flexibility and cost sharing.

Abstract. Literature reveals several characteristics that differentiate Industrial 
Product Service Systems (IPS²) from rather simple stand-alone products and 
(value added) services. Taking a closer look on these, the authors argue that the 
collaboration within provision and use phases of IPS² is the most significant 
characteristic to distinguish IPS² from other offerings. The empirical part of the 
paper supports this assumption. It is shown that the collaboration between sup-
plier and customer during the later stages of the IPS² life cycle in terms of co-
creation of value actually constitutes the real nature of IPS². 
Keywords: Industrial Product Service Systems, Characterization, Collaboration 
and Value Co-Creation.

Introduction 
Traditional manufacturing firms are increasingly shifting from selling stand-alone 
product or service offerings toward selling bundles of integrated product and service 
components. These highly customized solutions can also be characterized as Industri-
al Product Service Systems (IPS²). 
Literature reveals that several aspects differentiate IPS² offerings from rather sim-
ple stand-alone products and (value added) services. These are i) the combination and 
integration of product and service components, ii) the suppliers’ customer orientation, 
iii) the suppliers’ flexibility to adopt to changing customer demands, iv) the collabora-
tive planning and development of these components, and v) the co-creation of value 
during the life cycle or rather the collaborative provision and use of these compo-
nents. The research question arises whether these aspects are equally important to 
distinguish IPS² from stand-alone offerings or furthermore from common product-
service combinations. 
In order to analyze IPS² characteristics compared to usual product and service of-
ferings we conducted a survey with 127 participants. All participants have been in-
volved in buying decisions concerning manufacturing technology and automation 
solutions. In a first step the participants had to be divided into two groups: IPS² cus-
tomers and Non-IPS² customers. For this it was necessary to find out in which specif-
ic characteristics both groups differ from each other. Based on the various definitions 
of IPS² and on supplemental literature review specific characteristics of IPS² were 
elaborated. 
The paper at hand is organized as follows: First, we provide an overview of the 
commonly used characteristics to define IPS². Afterwards, we illustrate our empirical 

586

research methods and discuss the results. Within the last section we point out the im-
plication of our research and present further research questions. 
2 
Defining Industrial Product Service Systems 
In order to characterize IPS² an underlying definition is needed. Therefore, different 
definitions found in literature are presented and compared in the following. 
As Meier, Uhlmann and Kortmann (2005) stated, ‘‘an Industrial Product-Service 
System is characterized by the integrated and mutually determined planning, devel-
opment, provision and use of product and service shares including its immanent  
software components in Business-to-Business applications and represents a know-
ledge-intensive socio-technical system’’ [1 p.529]. Following this definition Meier, 
Roy and Seliger (2010) listed several aspects of IPS² in detail. According to their 
understanding, an “IPS² is an integrated product and service offering that delivers 
values in industrial applications – IPS² is a new product understanding consisting of 
integrated product and service shares – IPS² comprises the integrated and mutually 
determined planning, development, provision and use – IPS² includes the dynamic 
adoption of changing customer demands and provider abilities – a partial substitution 
of product and service shares over the lifecycle is possible – This integrated under-
standing leads to new, customer-adjusted solutions – and IPS² enable innovative func-
tion-, availability- or result-oriented business models.” [2 p.608] 
In other words, IPS² can be defined as bundles of several product and service com-
ponents. These bundles can also be denoted as high-value integrated solutions de-
signed to address a specific customer’s business or operational needs, like Davies 
(2004) as well as Davies et al. (2006) elaborate [3-4]. Bonney and Williams (2009) 
differentiate these types of offerings from traditional stand-alone product and service 
offerings as they note: “unlike individual products or traditional product/price bun-
dles, solutions are idiosyncratic offerings that integrate a range of supplier capabilities 
and assets to address fundamental, often latent buyer needs.” [5 p.1032] More detailed 
Sharma et al. (2002) characterize a solution by listing its criteria. In their view “a real 
solution … is a fundamentally different approach that creates additional value for 
customers and suppliers by meeting five criteria: It is co-created by a customer and a 
supplier; It integrates products with services to meet essential customer needs; Sup-
pliers accept some of the risk, often through performance-based and/or risk-based 
contracts; Relationships between suppliers and customers are unusually intimate, far 
beyond a traditional buy-sell relationship; Solutions, therefore, are tailored to each 
customer.” [6 p.3] 
Further, Ulaga and Reinartz (2011) refer to such solutions as hybrid offerings [7]. 
In their recent article they adopt the conceptualization of Shankar et al. (2007) par-
ticularly with regard to hybrid offerings in business markets that combine industrial 
goods and services. According to this, a hybrid offering is a combination of “one or 
more goods and one or more services, creating more customer benefits than if the 
good and service were available separately.” [8 p.2] The same authors provide a much 
simpler definition in a managerial article: “hybrid solutions are products and services 
combined into innovative offerings”. [9 p.95] 

 
The Real Nature of Industrial Product Service Systems 
587 
 
However, these definitions – despite that different terminologies are used to de-
scribe the offering – share several commonalities. On this basis, we describe an IPS² 
by five characteristics: 
• Combination and integration of product and service components, 
• Customer orientation, 
• Flexibility of contracts, 
• Collaborative planning and development, and 
• Collaborative provision and use. 
In the following we will have a closer look on these characteristics. 
3 
Characterizing Industrial Product Service Systems 
3.1 
Combination and Integration of Product and Service Components 
In Business-to-Business markets many suppliers offer services on top to the core 
product as a strategy to tailor their offerings better to each customer’s unique re-
quirements [3]. Services can be implemented at any stage of the long-lasting business 
relationship between customer and supplier. Services before the use phase are for 
example all consultancy services, like planning, developing or financing. During the 
use phase services regarding the maintenance of operated systems are most common. 
After the use phase the supplier can offer services like dismantling or disposal [3]. As 
these examples show, there are different forms and types of services. On the one 
hand, a service can be a quite simplistic repair and overhaul contract. On the other 
hand, the supplier can also actively participate in the customers’ production processes, 
e.g. carrying out certain steps of the production. 
In contrast to these service offerings, which are added to the core product, IPS² are 
integrated solutions of product and service components that combine industrial goods 
and services in a way so that the combination of these special offers creates more 
benefit for the customer than if the good and service would be offered separately [8]. 
Therefore, the pure combination of product and service components is not sufficient 
for a unique characteristic of IPS², because specific customer orientated bundles of 
products and services are widely-used strategies in the Business-to-Business markets 
and services differ in the degree of the collaboration. 
Asking practitioners about the degree of the combination and integration of prod-
uct and service components, they would probably indicate the degree as high although 
they only purchase simple stand-alone offerings or rather product-related services. 
3.2 
Customer Orientation 
Customer orientation is defined as the degree to which a supplier and its employees 
practice the marketing concept by trying to help their customers and being aware of 
the customer’s specific needs [10-11]. 

588 
M. Rese et al. 
 
From the IPS² definitions mentioned, it becomes apparent that customer orientation 
plays a key role in every stage of the IPS² life cycle and the occurring business rela-
tionship between customer and supplier. As already mentioned, IPS² are characterized 
by the integration of the customer in the planning, development, provision and use 
phase [1]. This close business relationship between both parties leads to an on-going 
dynamic adoption when the customer’s demands are changing [2]. 
However, the importance of customer orientation is well-known within all Busi-
ness-to-Business industries. It is based on the empirical evidence that customer orien-
tation has a positive effect on the whole company’s performance. Also stand-alone 
product and service offerings provided within the framework of traditional transac-
tional business models are mostly highly customized. In fact in Business-to-Business 
markets there are hardly any companies that do not act customer orientated. In turn, 
the concept of customer orientation does not seem to be suitable to define the unique-
ness of IPS². 
3.3 
Flexibility of Contracts 
Flexibility of contracts is not a new concept in practice as well. Flexible contracts 
already exist also for stand-alone product and service offerings, because companies 
are aware of the environmental uncertainty [12], like external factors, which are not 
under the control of the contracting units and thus may change in an unpredictable 
way [13]. With flexible contracts both parties try to ensure themselves when unex-
pected situations occur. These unexpected situations are dependent on market related 
factors [14], for example changes in law or changes regarding suppliers’ or custom-
ers’ requirements, which influence the market as a whole. All these changes cannot be 
foreseen and for both contracting parties it is necessary to build up contracts that 
leave room for certain changes. 
The flexibility of contracts for IPS² is based on the assumption that several aspects 
of the final offering might not be clearly determined during the contracting period, 
like the extent of delivery and the final configuration and relation between service and 
product components. In addition to that, most often even customers cannot explicitly 
determine their needs by themselves [15]. 
While for stand-alone products or services flexibility is usually desired in the de-
velopment and construction phases of projects, IPS² contracts also need flexibility 
during the use phase. Nevertheless, the flexibility of contracts cannot be a unique 
characteristic that separates traditional transactional offerings from relational IPS² 
offerings, because the use of flexible contracts is common not only for IPS². 
3.4 
Collaborative Planning and Development 
The aspect of collaborative planning and development between the supplier and the 
customer of products or services or product-service-bundles is not a rather new phe-
nomenon. Many researchers from various fields investigate and analyse the necessity 
to involve the customer within the planning and development phase of products and 
services [16-19]. 

 
The Real Nature of Industrial Product Service Systems 
589 
 
There are several factors that determine the degree to which a collaborative plan-
ning and development is necessary in a business relationship. First to mention is the 
individuality and specialization of an offering. The higher the amount of specific cus-
tomer requirements and needs regarding an offering the higher is the necessity for a 
collaborative planning and development. In contrast, rather standardized offerings are 
in most cases solely developed by the supplier. Second, the importance of the offering 
within the customer’s production process determines the necessity of collaborative 
planning and development efforts. If the offering plays a crucial role within the cus-
tomers’ production process, a collaborative planning and development is much more 
likely than in case of rather meaningless offerings. 
If these two aspects that determine the amount of collaborative planning and de-
velopment are applied to different kinds of offerings, it becomes obvious that it is not 
a characteristic that separates IPS² offerings from traditional product or service offer-
ings. Indeed, IPS² are in most cases rather highly individual and specific and often 
play a crucial role within the customers’ production processes. As Baines et al. (2007) 
point out, “a successful PSS needs to be designed at the systemic level from the client 
perspective and requires early involvement with the customer and changes in the or-
ganizational structures of the provider.” [20 p.1549] Nevertheless, this collaborative 
planning and development can also take place in case of offering standard products 
and/or services. Therefore, a division of standard products/services and IPS² by the 
degree of collaborative planning and development is not appropriate. 
3.5 
Collaborative Provision and Use – The Co-creation of Value 
The collaboration between the supplier and the customer during provision and use 
phases of an offering is a quite new phenomenon. This new type of relationship is 
emerging since new relational and collaborative business models came up [21]. First 
of all it is important to clarify what the term “collaborative provision and use” really 
means. Literature does not provide a clear definition of this co-creation aspect. The 
collaboration within provision and use phase between the supplier and the customer 
means a collaborative conducting of certain production processes [22]. In this sense, 
the role of customers is to “co-create value through the integration of firm-provided 
resources with other private and public resources”. [23 p.148] 
More and more suppliers tend not to sell their products, but carry out a certain pro-
duction process within the properties of their customers. In most cases the customer 
can benefit from this new type of business collaboration as the initial investments are 
relatively low. Neither the purchase of facilities nor the hiring or qualification of per-
sonal is in the customers’ responsibility. Therefore, the customer organization can 
concentrate on its core business, whereas the supplier conducts the underlying proc-
esses. Also the suppliers can benefit from such a business model. They do not sell 
their facility at one point of time, but can generate continuous incoming cash flows by 
getting paid on a regular base. Additionally, IPS² suppliers benefit from this business 
model as it is ensured that customers do not acquire specific knowledge regarding the 
production process and therefore somehow depend on the suppliers in conducting the 
production processes. 

590 
M. Rese et al. 
 
This collaboration in the use phase is an aspect that is unique for IPS² and to the 
best of our knowledge not applied in regular product business. At this point it be-
comes strikingly obvious what really characterizes IPS². As we have shown above, all 
commonly used characteristics and attributes are also applicable to usual product 
business. We are only talking of IPS² if the supplier offering contains business models 
in which he collaborates with the customer in the provision and use phase. Hence, the 
terminology ‘service’ has a slightly different meaning in the context of IPS². It not 
only encompasses all the intangible activities of the supplier like repair, maintenance, 
overhaul and so forth but also comprises collaborative business models.

Method 
4.1 
Survey Description 
Our survey consisted of 127 participants who were visiting a huge international trade 
fair for manufacturing technology and automation. The trade fair displays the entire 
scope of state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies for the metalworking industry – 
from machine tools and precision tools, to automation technology, to complete sys-
tems. The participants were randomly selected and asked whether they had a certain 
role in their companies’ buying processes. If they confirmed, each participant was 
given a four-page questionnaire. If they were not involved in their organizations’ 
buying processes they were excluded from participation. In the first part of the ques-
tionnaire participants were asked about the five characteristics of business relation-
ships, mentioned above. The scale items to measure IPS² characteristics are included 
in the appendix. Participants were asked to indicate their agreement regarding the five 
attributes on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I strongly disagree) to 7 (I 
strongly agree). The participants were mainly male (94.4%) and had an average te-
nure of 18 years (standard deviation: 11.387). 
4.2 
Results and Discussion 
Based on the five characteristics of IPS² participants had to be divided into two 
groups; one group of IPS² customers and the other group of Non-IPS² customers. 
The first attempt was to subjectively decide whether participants are IPS² custom-
ers or not by considering all five characteristics simultaneously. These decisions were 
made by three experts on IPS² who are researching in this area. Afterwards their final 
categorizations were compared so that inter-rater reliability is assumed. Unfortunate-
ly, the final categorizations were not the same at all. Thus, this method was not ap-
propriate.  
The second attempt was to divide the participants by having a closer look to the 
mean values of all characteristics, which are presented in table 1. In doing so, it was 
assumed that IPS² customers would rate the degree of all characteristics above the 
overall average including the standard deviation. Since the mean values range from 
3.74 to 4.65 adding the standard deviation, there were no participants who met these 
requirement concerning all characteristics. Thus, no IPS² customer group unfolds.

The theoretical findings presented in chapter three, provide a solution for this di-
lemma. Finally, participants were divided into IPS² and Non-IPS² customers by using 
only one of the five characteristics; the collaboration within provision and use phase. 
From the authors perspective this is the most significant distinguishing characteristic 
between IPS² offerings and stand-alone product and service offerings. The group of 
IPS² customers indicated that the provision and use of the supplier’s offering takes 
place in a strong collaboration. Participants within this group rated this characteristic 
higher than the mean value plus standard deviation (≥ 6). Non-IPS² customers indi-
cated that there is only little collaboration in the provision and use phase (< 6). Using 
this method groups end up with a size of 43 participants within the IPS² customers 
group and 84 participants within the Non-IPS² customers group. 
Based on this classification the mean values of all IPS² characteristics could be 
compared. Here it became apparent that for every characteristic the mean values in 
the group of IPS² customers were higher than in the Non-IPS² customers group. Fur-
ther, the highest differences between the two groups were found regarding the charac-
teristic “collaborative provision and use”. These results are shown in table 2. 
The differences in mean values that are shown in table 2 are significant. T-tests as 
well as variance analyses both show that the two groups differ significantly from each 
other in every of the five characteristics (see Appendix).

Summary and Conclusions  
As we have shown, quantitative empirical research in the context of IPS² has a fun-
damental structural problem. If a comparison between IPS² and standard product and 
service offerings shall be conducted, it is necessary to identify characteristics that 
really distinguish these two forms of offerings from each other. Our paper proposes a 
first approach to deal with this issue. 
As already stated, the commonly used definitions of IPS² identify five core charac-
teristics regarding this type of offerings. These are namely the combination and inte-
gration of product and service components, a high customer orientation, the flexibility 
of contracts, a collaborative planning and development phase and a collaborative 
provision and use phase. Our literature review reveals that four of these five aspects 
(the combination and integration of product and service components, a high customer 
orientation, the flexibility of contracts and a collaborative planning and development 
phase) are also appearing within the context of standard stand-alone product and ser-
vice business. Therefore, the collaboration between the customer and the supplier 
within the provision and use phase is the only aspect that really distinguishes these 
types of offerings from each other. We used this insight resulting of an extensive lite-
rature review and applied it on our empirical data, obtained from visitors of a huge 
trade fair on industrial manufacturing and automation. This way we were able to dif-
ferentiate survey participants in two groups, the IPS² group and the non-IPS² group. 
From a scientific perspective our research has several important implications. First, 
a way to distinguish IPS² offerings from standard product or service business is pro-
posed. This is an important step and contributes to research in this area as more

and more companies position themselves in the field of IPS² offerings although they 
are selling standard products and services in a traditional way. With the characteristic 
of collaboration between the supplier and the customer during the provision and use 
phase a way to identify “real” IPS² suppliers is given. Based on this researchers is 
given the opportunity to analyze many differing aspects between common product 
and service offerings and IPS². 
Additionally, our empirical data show that the other characteristics that define an 
IPS² are meaningful. We found significant differences between the group of IPS² 
customers and the group of Non-IPS² customers regarding customer orientation, flex-
ibility of contracts, the combination of products and services and a collaboration dur-
ing planning and development phase.

Abstract. Life-cycle cost statements become increasingly important for OEMs 
to stay competitive in today’s global environment. However, OEMs have to 
create this information from a poor data basis. Generating reliable statistical 
LCC statements despite the poor data is the methodical challenge. Conse-
quently, it’s crucial to set up an instrument that prepares the data for analysis 
and simplifies future data collection. Therefore, a database was set up for Licon 
mt GmbH & Co. KG and the Weibull solution method was adapted by using a 
weighted pseudo inverse matrix. Both, the database and the adapted method are 
presented. 
Keywords: Life Cycle Cost, Reliability, Data Analyses.

Introduction 
According to the cooperating company Licon mt GmbH & Co. KG, OEMs face a 
growing competition and cost pressure due to increasing globalization on the market. 
[1] Therefore, product quality needs to be a differentiator. In order to visualize the 
advantages of high quality products Life Cycle Cost (LCC) statements are used. [2]  
They demonstrate what studies of [3-7] revealed: purchase prices are 20% of the 
actual costs that derive from a product lifecycle. Considering the whole product life-
cycle, high quality products can thus be cheaper than minor quality products due to 
less maintenance activities. Therefore, maintenance costs play a key role when con-
cerning LCC. 
Not only OEMs but also machine tool operators face an increasing global competi-
tion. Therefore, they need to reduce their production costs and improve their produc-
tivity which in turn results from a reduction of machine downtimes. Thus, machine 
reliability gains in importance over the whole machine’s lifecycle.  
The customer’s request for reliable machines leads to special industrial product 
service systems. These systems consist of an integrated bundle of a product and its 
service, generating a higher value for the customer [8]. Within the machine and plant 
industry, special warranties represent those industrial product service systems (IPS²). 
Machines are sold in combination with a distinguished warranty which guarantees a 
level of availability, specifically the number of possible machine working hours. This 
increases the machine’s value for the customer. These availability warranties are basic 
requirements for investment decisions, today. [9, 10] 

598

In this context reliability improvement warranties (RIW) are in focus. Given a 
RIW, the machine manufacturer is obliged to provide a certain level of reliability. [8, 
11-15] A related concept is represented by the Life-Cycle-Cost-Warranty (LCCW) 
that guarantees an upper limit of maintenance costs for selected LCC-components. 
The reliability of machine components highly affects maintenance costs, which 
make up for a major share of Life Cycle Costs and therefore also build an essential 
part of LCC statements. [3, 16-20] So, when creating warranties both service costs for 
machine failures and the number of machine failures within the warranty period are 
crucial information highly influencing the warranty. 
Data on these costs and lifetimes are generated via statistical models using field 
data which on the one hand have the advantage of being related to the practical use of 
the machine tool but on the other hand are a rather poor database. Due to few compa-
rable machines which usually have a high reliability, failure data is mostly very sparse 
and suspended. [21] 
As will be shown in section 2.2 the quality of data has a major impact on the gen-
erated statements. Therefore, presenting an approach for simplifying correct data 
collection and analyzing the existing poor data by taking into account minor data 
quality is the aim of this paper.  
The paper is organized as follows: Chapter 2 gives an overview of the state of the 
art of and reliability analysis as well as possible censoring and failures of data. Chap-
ter 3 presents the methodology of future data collection using a specific database and 
the new approach for exceeding analysis of the existing poor data. Chapter 4 gives the 
resulting conclusions and chapter 5 contains the summary.

Literature Review 
2.1 
Reliability Analyses 
The aim of reliability analyses is to determine the failure behaviour of a machine’s 
component. In this context reliability is defined according to [22-24]: reliability is the 
probability that a product does not fail under given environmental conditions during a 
defined period of time.  
Considering a machine’s reliability leads to substantiated prognosos on expected 
machine downtimes which have a high impact on future maintenance costs. Several 
analyzing and forecasting methods are used to generate reliability statements. The 
reliability of a component depends on the operating and load conditions under which 
it is processed. These factors influence the failure probability of a component. For 
example: the longer a component has been used, the more loads it has endured, the 
higher its failure probability. Therefore, statistical methods are used to describe the 
failure probability which directly leads to conclusions of its reliability.  
For stochastic modelling of the failure probability different functions are suggested 
[12, 22, 25]. By far the most commonly used one among them is the two-parameter 
Weibull distribution [26, 22, 23, 27, 28]. The object of the Weibull analysis is to de-
termine the distribution parameters (β, η) based on the failure data records and  
suspended data (see chapter 2.2). This data basis can be derived from life testing, 
maintenance and service reports or replacement part sales [see 29-31].

The suspended data records are taken into account of the analysis by using the 
Johnson method [32]. When applying the Johnson method a rank is assigned to each 
failure record according to its observed working hours without failures. In this as-
signment, the suspended data records are considered and affect the assigned ranks. 
Afterwards the Rank Regression is applied to fit the ranked data to the linearized 
Weibull curve [27]. This regression utilizes the least squares method. This is the most 
widely used procedure for the determination of the Weibull failure probability distri-
bution function. 
Other methods simply use the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) instead of a 
fully parameterized probability function. As the MTBF is an average value it contains 
less information than a fully parameterized probability function. However, it is much 
easier to calculate and understand which is the reason for its common use in industry. 
The calculation of the MTBF as the average value of the observed working hours 
often leads to misleading conclusions. Therefore, this method should not be used. 
2.2 
Quality of Data 
Whatever analyzing method is used the given data is crucial for the results. Usually 
the given data is subject to certain failures or suspensions. The suspensions can be 
divided into right and left censored data. If the machine started working before the 
observation period begun, it is not known for how long the machine worked until its 
first observed failure. This is described by the term right censored data. Left censored 
data arise if the observation period ends while a machine is still working. So, only the 
machine’s working hours until the end of the observation period are known but not 
the whole period of time until it failed. Only if at least two failures occur within the 
observation period unsuspended data records can be derived. 
Besides, the suspension data can be faulty. If the data is not tracked automatically 
at each failure, some failure data records can be missed easily. This significantly pro-
longs the recorded working hours of the machine between two tracked failures before 
and after the missed one. Those failures and suspensions have strong effects on the 
accuracy of analysis which will be shown in section 3.4. Therefore, a systematic data 
acquisition is needed. By now most of the data records are generated manually when 
applying service to machines in the field which bears a high risk of data failures or 
losses. Achieving higher quality of data is one motivation for the development of an 
appropriate database, which then leads to an improvement in monitoring and forecast-
ing reliability. With reliability being an essential factor for creating warranties as 
discussed earlier, handling low qualitative data is particularly important in the context 
of IPS².

calculation of the regression line but the early failures have a greater impact on the 
least squares method due to the logarithm (see formula 1). Consider two failure data 
records at t1=100h and t2=10.000h. The true underlying Weibull distribution function 
shall be: 
 
(3)
Given this function, the true values for t1 and t2 are F(t1)=0,08 and F(t2)=0,78. The 
corresponding values obtained by the Johnson-method are FJ(t1)=0,1 and FJ(t2)=0,8. 
So the difference for both values is ΔF(t)= FJ(t)-F(t)=0,02. 
Regarding the same calculation for the linearized case the following results arise:  
For t1=100h: 
 x1=4,605;y1=-2,250 
yJ1=-2,484;Δy1=yJ1-y1=0,234 
For t2=10.000h:  x2=9,210;y2=0,476 
yJ2=0,415;Δy2=yJ2-y2=0,061 
So, when linearizing the function before applying the least squares method, early 
failures have a greater impact than later failures do. In order to overcome this weak-
ness in the presented procedure, different methods are proposed in the next section. 
3.3 
Exceeding Analysis Methods 
The here presented approaches have been developed in close cooperation with Licon 
mt GmbH & Co. KG, a supplier of machining centers and production systems. The 
developed methods have one common property: they consider and overcome the 
weakness presented in section 3.2. They either fit the data to a Weibull distribution 
function before linearizing the function or they compensate the arising consequences. 
In this paper two approaches are presented: The numerical minimization of the 
sums of error squares which fits the data to the Weibull distribution before the lineari-
zation and the algebraic minimization of the sums of error squares which takes the 
problems into account that are arising from the linearization. Both methods apply the 
Johnson method to the failure data in order to generate FJ(t). 
When using the numerical minimization of the sum of error squares, Weibull dis-
tributions with different parameter combinations (β, η) are build. For each parameter 
combination the sum of error squares between the Weibull distribution and the under-
lying data is evaluated. Since two parameters need to be adjusted, this calculation has 
two loops, one for β and one for η. The parameter combination with the smallest sum 
of error squares is chosen.  
When applying the algebraic minimization of the sums of error squares, a system 
of linear equations arises. Each failure data record leads to one linear equation. The 
equation system can then be expressed in a matrix notation. As the resulting matrix is 
not invertible and not in quadratic form, its inverse cannot be created.  
Since more than two equations face two variables, this equation system cannot be 
fulfilled for linear independence of the equations. In order to find the solution that 
best meets the criteria of minimizing the sum of error squares, the Moore–Penrose 
pseudo inverse [34] is used. This concept is exceeded by using the weighted pseudo

inverse [35] to offset the linearization problems (see section 3.2). Therefore, three 
assumptions have to be made: 
1. All recorded failures in the data records are statistically independent. 
2. The expected value of the difference between the recorded failure data and the ac-
tual Weibull distribution is zero. 
3. The variance of the difference between the recorded failure data and the actual 
Weibull distribution has a constant value. 
Given these assumptions, the weighted pseudo inverse can be used to identify the 
Weibull distribution that best fits the recorded failure data.  
The here presented numerical and algebraic methods as well as the commonly used 
procedure using the Rank-Regression will be compared in the next section. 
3.4 
Comparison of the Analyses 
When comparing the presented methods, different data conditions have to be consi-
dered. As mentioned in chapter 1, the database given for analysis can be very poor. 
Therefore, the methods are compared regarding data of different quality levels: com-
plete data and data with 20% losses. The corresponding database is generated by si-
mulating Weibull distributions with different parameter combinations.  
Four parameters can be altered: β, η, the number of relevant machines and the ob-
served period of time. Those four parameters were selected because they vary in giv-
en industrial data. The parameter η however, is not further varied, since it determines 
only the position but not the shape of the Weibull distribution. 
Failure data records are now generated corresponding to the specified parameters 
(β, the number of concerned machines and the observed period of time). Weibull dis-
tributions are determined according to the parameters, and data records are drawn 
from them randomly. Therefore, uniformly distributed numbers out of the range 0 to 1 
are drawn. The dissolution of the Weibull distribution function then results in corres-
ponding failure times t.

For each machine random numbers are drawn until the sum of the individual failure 
times t is greater than the specified observation period. Then the last failure data 
record will be deleted. The difference between the sum of failure times and the obser-
vation period represents a suspension. This is done for the specified number of ma-
chines and leads to a complete database. The databases with losses are generated by 
randomly deleting 20% of the given data records. The resulting data basis is analyzed 
by using the presented three methods. The results are shown below. In the given re-
sults two characteristic values were examined: the difference in MTBF values and the 
standard deviation. Each simulation run generates a data basis. When analyzing this 
data basis the different methods lead to different Weibull parameters and thus expect

different underlying Weibull distributions. Based on the determined parameters the 
expected MTBF (MTBFsim) for the expected underlying Weibull distribution is calcu-
lated. For each simulation run with the same input parameters, the resulting MTBF is 
calculated. Then the arithmetic mean of these MTBFs (MTBFam) is calculated. As the 
true underlying Weibull distribution is known from the input parameters β and η of 
the simulation, the true MTBF (MTBFtrue) can be calculated as well. The difference of 
MTBFam and MTBFtrue is a measure of the quality of the analysis.  
Besides, the standard deviation of the different MTBFsim values for simulation runs 
is regarded. This gives an impression about the robustness of the different methods. 
The results for the different data basis are shown below. 
 
Complete Data. Figure 4 shows the results for all three methods when analyzing a 
complete data basis. 
 
 
Fig. 4. Difference to Weibull distribution MTBF for complete data (left) and standard deviation 
of MTBFsim for complete data (right) 
Figure 4 clearly shows that all calculation methods converge towards the true un-
derlying Weibull distribution for high machine working hours which means, for a 
long observation period. It also demonstrates that the commonly used Rank-
Regression method cannot compete at any time with the best practices. 
Considering the scattering of the calculated MTBFsim it leads to a similar result. If the 
standard deviation of the MTBFsim is plotted against the machine hours (see Figure 4), 
the numerical method shows an even greater dominance. So for complete data the 
numerical method is the most robust one. 
 
Data with 20% Losses. 20% of data losses seem to be realistic. The lifecycle of ma-
chines is much longer than the warranty period of its manufacturer lasts. After the 
warranty expires, most customers handle maintenance activities on their own.  
So afterwards, only a small percentage of failure data records are reported to the 
machine manufacturer. Besides, some data records get lost due to human reporting 
errors. As can be seen in Figure 5, all the curves shifted significantly upwards in 
comparison to the complete data basis. The numerical method is no longer clearly 
superior to the algebraic one.

Figure 5 shows the strong dominance of the new calculation methods (numerical 
and algebraic ones). Although all calculation methods converge towards the same 
difference level for long observation periods again, the Rank-Regression method is 
clearly exceeded for all machine working hours. The algebraic and the numerical 
method are clearly superior as they adopt much better MTBFam values, even for short 
observation periods.  
The standard deviation shows a similar behavior (see Figure 5). All methods show 
a weaker performance as with the complete data basis. But considering the logarith-
mic scaling of the axis, the presented numerical and algebraic methods are clearly 
superior to the Rank-Regression.

Conclusions 
As shown in section 2.2, a poor data basis always has a negative effect on the result 
achieved by analysis. This negative effect is obviously given for all analyzing me-
thods. The better the quality of the data basis is the better are the achieved results. 
Therefore, the given data should be as complete as possible. Improving the quality of 
the data basis is supported by the database presented in section 3.1. It allows a syste-
matic collection of data. By the predetermined information fields, the data quantity to 
be recorded is also reduced to the relevant data parts. 
In industrial practice, the available data basis is generally poor. In order to get the 
best possible information out of the available data, it is crucial to use appropriate me-
thods of analysis. According to section 3.2 the commonly used Rank-Regression me-
thod is inferior. Both presented methods the numerical and the algebraic minimization 
of the sums of error squares are to be preferred to the case of incomplete data.

Summary 
The paper presents an approach for simplifying correct data collection by using an 
appropriate database. The presented database is offering a simple overview of the 
needed data. It consists of a systematic structure which includes columns for relevant

data information needed for analysis. With regard to maintenance costs all relevant 
data for prediction, i.e. service costs for machine failures and the historical machine 
lifetimes, are collected. However, the purpose of this database is not only data collec-
tion but also an integrated data analysis with a simple user-friendly interface. Besides 
the database the paper presented and compared different analyzing methods. The 
performance of these methods was regarded for different data qualities by the use of 
simulations. The proposed methods showed to be superior in the case of poor data. 
So, those new methods generate more trustworthy predictions of the machine’s re-
liability and maintenance costs and thus enable the manufacturer to calculate prices 
for the IPS² bundle of machine and warranty more precisely. As [15] states the un-
availability of useful data for prediction is a problem in the flied of IPS². Therefore, 
this paper will support the diffusion process of IPS² in the machine and plant industry. 
The close cooperation with Licon mt GmbH & Co. KG in developing the analyzing 
methods and building the database led to a direct feedback from industry. The data-
base with its analyzing methods is set up to the needs of our cooperating partner. It 
now is an implemented part in the industrial practice of Licon mt GmbH & Co. KG.

Abstract. The beginning of a Product-Service System´s lifecycle is surrounded 
by a high degree of uncertainty regarding customers’ todays and prospective re-
quirements. Thus, the ability to adapt a Product-Service System to changing 
customer requirements by providing flexibility becomes an important quality 
and success criterion along the entire lifecycle. This paper analyzes existing ap-
proaches of economic and engineering theory dealing with the assessment of 
flexibility in the industrial environment. A State of the Art is provided including 
literature reviews on both the economic assessment, based on NPV and ROA, 
and the engineering assessment, based on a detailed flexibility analysis that ori-
ginates from manufacturing systems. The article continues with implications, 
followed by a recommendation and appoints tasks for further research. 
Keywords: Product-Service Systems, Flexibility, Assessment.

Introduction 
Customers of capital goods no longer demand pure technical products, but customized 
solutions, consisting of a product enhanced by different services along its life cycle 
that are generally understood as Product-Service Systems (PSS) in the industrial B2B-
area [1-2]. Therefore, capital goods manufacturers enter into long-term business to 
business relationships with their customers. In particular, at the beginning of these 
relationships a high degree of uncertainty regarding customers’ todays and prospec-
tive requirements exists [3]. 
Thus, the ability to adapt PSS to changing customer requirements becomes an im-
portant quality and success criterion along the entire lifecycle. While flexibility of 
manufacturing systems has been subject of research for many years [4-6], flexibility 
of service structures and processes is rarely considered. In order to assess and im-
prove flexibility of PSS a flexibility concept is required that contains PSS-specific 
types of flexibility as well as adequate assessing methods. Against this background, 
this paper aims at analyzing existing approaches of flexibility assessment that mostly 
originate from an economic perspective. It also focuses on manufacturing systems 

610 
J. Keine et al. 
regarding their suitability for PSS. At first, a conceptual understanding of PSS flex-
ibility is given. Subsequently, requirements regarding a suitable assessment method 
for PSS flexibility are derived. Finally, these requirements are confronted with exist-
ing assessment approaches for assessing flexibility from economic and manufacturing 
perspective. Therefrom, implications for further research on assessing flexibility of 
PSS are derived.

Flexibility of Product-Service Systems 
2.1 
Definition 
The scientific literature provides a variety of definitions of flexibility in the context of 
manufacturing systems [4-6]. Due to the fact that most of these definitions are formu-
lated rather generally and refer to systems, they can be used as a basis for developing 
a flexibility definition for PSS. Besides of manufacturing aspects, it is of particular 
importance to include flexibility of service structures and processes of a PSS. In this 
area there is still a lack of definitions and concepts in the literature. 
In the following, flexibility of PSS is understood as the ability to adapt to changing 
customer requirements without significant effort of time and cost. Additionally, an 
adequate consideration of arising risks is necessary. Thereby, adaptions of the prod-
uct, of services and external production factors as well as their interplay have to be 
taken into account. Therefore, a wide range of possible system conditions constitutes 
a key prerequisite. Moreover, flexibility of PSS is understood as a relative property 
that depends not only on a PSS but also on the external requirements respectively 
changing circumstances. 
2.2 
New Scope of Consideration 
In order to assess flexibility, first the scope of consideration has to be defined. PSS 
can be viewed from a static and a dynamic perspective [7]. From a static, system theo-
retical point of view, PSS can be differentiated into three subsystems [8, see Figure 
1]. Those contain different elements that include the production factors for delivering 
PSS. The subsystem “product” represents a technical product that is divided by means 
of a function structure. The subsystem “customer” includes all external production 
factors the customer contributes to the PSS-realization (e.g. production site, user). The 
subsystem “service network” comprises the organizational and operational structures 
that are necessary to produce different services. When having a system theoretical 
view on PSS, flexibility is considered as system inherent. 
In general, the lifecycle of PSS can either be viewed from provider’s or from cus-
tomer’s perspective [1-2]. In the following, a PSS within customer environment is 
considered as scope of investigation for flexibility assessment. It starts with an in-
vestment phase that can be differentiated into decision making and purchasing. This is 
followed by a long usage phase of the product that is supported by different services. 
Finally, the disposal of the product takes place [9-10]. Neither the integrated 
processes of planning and developing a PSS nor the manufacturing processes are

subject of the flexibility assessment. Thus, a suitable flexibility concept for PSS has to 
cover both system flexibility and the flexibility of the delivery processes from cus-
tomer’s point of view.

2.3 
Types of Flexibility for Product-Service Systems 
In the scientific literature there is agreement that flexibility is a multidimensional 
phenomenon and determined by numerous influence factors [11]. This can also be 
transferred to PSS. In order to assess flexibility, different types of flexibility have to 
be defined that operationalize system and process flexibility of PSS. System flexibili-
ty consists of the flexibility of the aforementioned sub-systems. System flexibility is 
an intrinsic property respectively potential that sets the architecture for process flex-
ibility of PSS. Process flexibility comprehends the ability of adapting process se-
quences and deployed internal and external production factors within delivery of PSS. 
Those processes result from the interaction between the sub-systems of a PSS. 
In the following, system-oriented types of flexibility are proposed that serve for as-
sessing flexibility of PSS and are mainly based on [4-6]: 
 
Sub-system “product” 
• Product flexibility: ability of a product to carry out different production tasks 
economically and with acceptable quality. This also includes the ability for conver-
tibility. 
• Volume flexibility: ability of a product to produce different production lots eco-
nomically and with acceptable quality.

• Operation flexibility: ability of a product to operate in different production envi-
ronments (e.g. mobile working machinery) as well as to produce different product 
variants. 
• Expansion flexibility: ability of a product to be expanded without noteworthy cost 
and time (e.g. by additional product modules). 
Sub-system “customer” 
• Customer flexibility: ability of external production factors (customer’s personnel, 
auxiliary material etc.) to adapt to changing circumstances. 
Sub-system “service network” 
• Service flexibility: ability of a service network to perform different types of ser-
vices economically and with acceptable quality. 
• Volume flexibility: ability of a service network to perform different numbers of 
services economically and with acceptable quality.  
• Operation flexibility: ability to deliver services in different (production) environ-
ments as well to deliver different service variants. 
• Expansion flexibility: ability of a service network to be expanded easily (e.g. 
additional service technicians). 
 
Process flexibility of PSS can be specified into flexibility of production processes and 
flexibility of service processes: 
 
• Production process flexibility: ability to achieve production goals in different 
process sequences. Depends on the flexibility of the product and the machine user. 
• Service process flexibility: ability to generate a customer benefit with different 
process sequences. Depends on the flexibility of service network as well as on the 
flexibility of external factors (e.g. customer’s personnel).

State of the Art in Flexibility Assessment: Review 
Flexibility of PSS is analyzed from different points of view. At first, contextual re-
quirements are worked out. In the second place, the assessment process of flexibility 
is based on an economic perspective. In the third place, flexibility is analyzed from a 
technical, engineering perspective. 
3.1 
Identification of Requirements 
Regarding the characteristics of PSS in the industrial area (B2B), the following re-
quirements to assess a PSS´s value were identified as working definitions: 
• Level of assessment 
The level of assessment is subdivided into two hierarchical categories: The PSS´s 
level considers the generic system and process level. In other words, the generic result 

 
Lifecycle Oriented Flexibility Assessment of Customized Solutions 
613 
can be metered. The second hierarchical level is understood as level of elements. It 
contains the subsystem and subprocess level and provides a more detailed description 
of flexibility of product and service parts, as well as the influence of the external fac-
tor. This level is far more detailed and gives insight in form of subsystems or subpro-
cesses that are necessary to achieve the generic result. 
• Dimensions of assessment 
The dimensions of assessment include the categories of cost, time, adaptability and 
risk. These dimensions help to ensure a PSS´s functionality and productivity and the-
rewith its overall performance. Therefore, they are important factors for an economi-
cally significant assessment of PSS in the industrial area and necessary to support 
technical decisions by economic values. 
• Time of assessment 
As far as PSS are considered, their attention is devoted to a long-term orientation and 
therewith to a lifecycle centered point of view. The long-term influence of decisions 
made in this context reverts to the underlying processes that are in charge of running 
the PSS successfully. Going on to an assessment that is conducted during the whole 
lifecycle and several times, effects of changes over time become obvious. This 
enables decision makers to adapt decisions formerly made to maintain the effective-
ness of the underlying PSS and to react properly to changes in customer requirements 
or market needs. 
But why is the assessment of flexibility important for PSS and how it can be done? 
In today´s economic environment the importance of long-term success is more and 
more under pressure by rising competition mostly from BRIC-countries. Anyway, the 
rising competition is accompanied by an increased appreciation of lifecycle costs by 
decision makers mostly from Eastern countries [12]. Even if some decision makers 
still rely on acquisition costs, their portion is decreasing because decision makers 
from emerging countries overcome this traditional, short-term thinking and switch to 
a lifecycle orientation [12]. 
In the following, the state of the art in evaluating flexibility of PSS is provided. 
3.2 
Assessment of Product-Service Systems as Investment Projects  
PSS in the industrial area can be characterized as investment projects, because of the 
need for investments under uncertainty at the beginning of their development [13]. 
Hence, the approaches to be introduced in 3.2.1 originate from an investment point of 
view. 
3.2.1 
Literature Review Regarding Flexibility Assessment of  
Product-Service Systems 
In reference [14] it is argued that use of the Real Options Analysis (ROA) can be a 
useful tool to determine a situation specific and appropriate degree of provided and 
inherent flexibility of a PSS. The whole purpose is to offer and understand flexibility 
as an option to improve the measurability of flexibility´s economic value in monetary 
terms [3]. Richter, Sadek and Steven [3] dealt with the concept of modularization [15] 

614 
J. Keine et al. 
and observed that modularization may be a helpful tool to increase flexibility. They 
concluded that the approach of Baldwin and Clark [15] - when used for PSS in the 
industrial area - is of limited use, because of assuming additivity in value of modules. 
In contrast, PSS used in an industrial environment are characterized by interdependent 
parts of products and services that influence each other. This is due to the concerted 
development process regarding products and services [3]. 
Rese, Karger and Strotmann [16] tried to implement flexibility by determining the net 
present value, followed by a decision tree that is based on real options for prospective 
changes. In order to choose the best possible decision, the different option values are 
determined by using a recursive approach. By using a combination of NPV and ROA in 
the way of [16], a possible solution with and without flexibility is provided. 
Karger et al. [17] valued flexibility according to the requirements of industrial PSS. 
On the one hand, the authors conducted the customer´s willingness to pay for addi-
tional flexibility and interpreted the result as value of the underlying option. On the 
other hand, the net value of the provided flexibility is conducted by including the 
provider´s costs for offering this flexibility and assessed by using the NPV approach. 
It is concluded that the supplier´s choice how to implement flexibility depends on the 
resulting value with regard to its amount in monetary terms. 
Table 1. Literature review regarding assessment of flexibility of PSS 
 
 
Abele et al. [18] created a concept to use the ROA on product centered manufac-
turing systems in order to insert flexibility including its contribution to create value. 
As the authors dealt with practical problems regarding different manufacturing sys-
tems, their proposal of using the Black-Scholes formula [19] is to be discussed brief-
ly. The approach seems to be attractive for the focal scope as the authors focused on 
different kinds of manufacturing systems and tried to assess some kinds of flexibility.

Especially, the use of the Black-Scholes formula limits the focal analysis to only one 
kind of uncertainty. Furthermore, the Black-Scholes assumptions of a known market 
price in combination with a European option are quite unrealistic [20] for real assets 
in the B2B-area. 
In the industrial environment of PSS, an option may also be an American option. 
This means that the option can be drawn at any time before maturity. Hence, the use 
of the Black-Scholes-Formula is insufficient with regard to the requirements of PSS 
and a multitude of different kinds of uncertainty. Furthermore, practitioners claim that 
a complexity reduction, as it is done by financial options using the Black-Scholes 
formula, may be risky because of the nonobservance of a multitude of variables that 
influence the underlying option(s) [21-22]. 
Table 1 unfolds that there is still a great potential for research regarding the measu-
rability of flexibility by using Real Options in context of PSS. These articles are 
mainly based on the topic of industrial PSS but do not implement a formalized Real 
Options analysis capable to quantify a chosen flexibility option. 
In the following, approaches for valuing Real Options are presented. Those are  
realistic but focus on valuing investment decisions with Real Options in general. 
Nonetheless, using these approaches seems to be an adequate way to enhance the 
measurability of flexibility for PSS in the B2B-area. 
3.2.2 
Evolution towards the Applicability on Product-Service Systems 
The aforementioned approaches tried to implement flexibility into the context of PSS 
in the industrial B2B-area. These approaches can be understood as effective but still 
remain rudimentary in assessing real options and their value contribution. 
As a first step to extend the adequacy of assessing the value of flexibility, the eval-
uation process of Copeland and Antikarov [20] is discussed. They argued, that the 
best comparable for the object of investigation is an adequate approximation of itself. 
The traditional approach of NPV is used on the investment project and constitutes the 
starting point for the further analysis. The NPV approach can normally be used as a 
static or dynamic version. Copeland and Antikarov use a Monte-Carlo simulation to 
determine an adequate approximation of prospective present values in different points 
of time. The assumption of a random walk of changes in the underlying present values 
supports the use of Monte-Carlo simulation in the evaluation approach. Due to this 
assumption, it is possible to consider a variety of uncertainties. This is an advantage 
compared to the Black-Scholes formula that is only capable to consider one kind of 
uncertainty. 
But, the problem of an increase in complexity, because of a variety of different 
kinds of uncertainty is to narrow down. The complexity reduction is solved by com-
bining different kinds of uncertainty - by using a Monte-Carlo simulation - and treat-
ing them like one. Therefore, the estimation of volatility is a key element to receive a 
satisfying result. This procedure may lead to falsification if the underlying uncertain-
ties cannot be combined due to e.g. interdependencies. Even if statistical difficulties 
occur, an accompanying event tree can be constructed. It displays surrounding forms 
of uncertainty and the evolution of the present value in distinctive points of time in a 
binominal lattice. Until now, options to deal with underlying uncertainty are neither 
considered nor assessed. 

616 
J. Keine et al. 
By implementing specific kinds of flexibility, the event tree is transformed into a 
decision tree including a converted risk scheme and additional costs because of the 
provision of additional flexibility. For the first time, a difference between the values 
with and without flexibility results. Until now, the value of incorporated options is not 
evaluated separately. The approach concludes with valuing the different revenues 
from step to step of the decision tree and therewith the added Real Options. 
3.2.3 
Boundaries for the Applicability 
As this approach seems to be feasible, some critics are noticeable. The problem is, 
that every time a decision tree is built up, assumptions have to be made, e.g. about 
future values of options etc., that are based primarily on uncertain and asymmetric 
information [21]. Haathela [23] constitutes that the approach of Copeland and Antika-
rov [20] leads to a bias in the estimated volatility and is therefore to be adapted ac-
cording to the underlying focus of a particular analysis. Furthermore, the approach of 
Copeland and Antikarov [20] is not built up to value Real Options in (industrial) PSS. 
The special characteristic of an integrated development of product and service parts is 
difficult to measure. The value contribution of a technical part is measurable quite 
easily because of the existence of appropriate data. It becomes much more compli-
cated to measure the value contribution of services like training courses or a techni-
cian’s personnel skill. But the main problem to be solved in future research is to  
determine the value that evolves from the collaboration of provider and customer. 
The similarities to the approaches analyzed in 3.2.1 are pointed out in the  
following: 
An exclusive and separated usage of the approaches mentioned above, limits the 
focal scope to chosen, localized applications. Changes over time are not considered 
adequately. In case of using only a static NPV approach without considering flexibili-
ty options, the consequence will be a permanent underestimation of the project´s real 
value [16]. The resulting bias may lead to incorrect managerial decisions. Using ROA 
separately is extremely difficult to solve due to a significant rise in complexity and 
effort in computing option values. The approach of Copeland and Antikarov [20] 
including critics of Haathela [23] can be understood as a feasible starting point for the 
valuation of flexibility of (industrial) PSS.

Flexibility Assessment of Product-Service Systems Based on Approaches 
from a Manufacturing Perspective 
3.3.1 
Literature Review Regarding Flexibility of Manufacturing Systems 
Flexibility assessments in manufacturing environments refer either to technical or to 
socio-technical systems. This includes approaches on different system levels (plant 
level, production line level, and machine level). In this context, numerous assessment 
approaches were developed. In the following section selected approaches for flexibili-
ty assessment on machine level are analyzed and evaluated against the defined re-
quirements of PSS (see chapter 3.1). 
Most approaches for assessing flexibility refer to manufacturing systems respec-
tively machine level. Mandelbaum and Brill [24] developed a mathematical descrip-
tion of flexibility that is based on theory of probability. They defined measures in 
order to quantify the notion of how well a machine or group of machines can absorb

changed requirements. They recommended measuring the efficiency of the manufac-
turing equipment in performing its tasks to evaluate manufacturing flexibility. Chang 
et al. [25] described flexibility of manufacturing systems as a function of range of 
operations, time, and cost. They propose different equations that are based on entropy 
approach, which was extended from information theory, and the Data Envelopment 
Analysis (DEA) for the measurement of manufacturing flexibility [25].

Reinhart et al. [26] understand flexibility as a potential of a manufacturing system 
that is determined in the early phases of its design. Thereby, they considered volume 
and variant flexibility. In order to measure and assess flexibility of manufacturing 
systems they developed indicators for each flexibility type. These indicators are sup-
posed to be monitored within so called flexibility corridors [26-27]. Baykasoglu et al. 
[28] the theory of permanents is applied to measure the flexibility of manufacturing 
systems. They developed a flexibility diagraph that comprehends different states that 
a system is able to work in and its possibility to move from one state to another. Flex-
ibility is determined by assessing the efficiency of the current state as well as the effi-
ciency of moving from one state to another. Moreover, flexibility depends on the 
probability of operating in one state as well as the probability of changing states [28]. 
Lanza et al. [29] propose an assessment approach for flexible quantities (volume) and 
product variants in production. It aims at forecasting production costs by a simulation 
algorithm that allows a comparison between different production scenarios.

against the requirements derived from the characteristics of PSS. It serves as summa-
rizing overview of the discussed approaches of flexibility assessment in manufactur-
ing environments. 
3.3.2 
Implications to Flexibility Assessment of Product-Service Systems 
Research on flexibility of manufacturing systems goes back to the early 1980s. Thus, 
numerous flexibility types and assessment methodologies were developed and dis-
cussed in this area. With regard to PSS it can be captured that these approaches are 
transferable to the sub-system “product” of a PSS. However, there is still a lack of 
approaches for flexibility assessment of service networks and the influences of exter-
nal factors. Moreover, the interdependencies between product and services that occur 
within PSS delivery process are not covered by the existing approaches. In order to 
fill this gap, investigating the existing approaches regarding their expandability to 
assess flexibility of service network and external factor seems promising. Therefore, 
approaches have to be appropriate to measure and assess the flexibility types for PSS 
defined in chapter 2.3. 
There is wide agreement in the scientific literature that flexibility of manufacturing 
systems can be assessed regarding the dimensions cost, time, and amount of possibili-
ties for adaption. These dimensions are also included in the aforementioned flexibility 
definition for PSS. Among the analyzed approaches only [28] considers these three 
dimensions equally. Most of the approaches focus only on one dimension and consid-
er the others indirectly. With regards to PSS the system-oriented flexibility types 
should be measured by indicators concerning possibilities for adaption. The process-
oriented types of flexibility should be measured by indicators in terms of effort of cost 
and time needed for adaptions. For visualizing and monitoring these indicators, the 
flexibility corridor according to [26] is applicable. It has to be noted that system flex-
ibility of PSS constitutes a key influence factor on process flexibility. These interde-
pendencies between flexibility types exist and have to be revealed and included in the 
flexibility assessment of PSS. 
Most of the analyzed approaches are based on ex ante assessments that use differ-
ent scenarios and simulation algorithms to forecast flexibility. This is caused by the 
fact that flexibility is viewed as an inherent property of a system that is determined 
before its usage. But these simulation-based approaches seem problematic when 
transferring them to service processes. In particular, customer contributions in service 
processes are highly individual and therefore difficult to predict and hard to simulate 
[30]. Rather, a lifecycle oriented approach is necessary that allows a measurement of 
flexibility indicators at defined measuring times during delivery of PSS. At this point 
it can be concluded that new indicators have to be developed that are able to operatio-
nalize all flexibility types for PSS. In particular, indicators for measuring and  
assessing the flexibility types of service networks, customer influences on PSS flex-
ibility as well as the interdependencies between products and services are required.

Summary and Further Research  
This article focused on both the economic and the engineering point of view. From 
the economic perspective, the assessment of flexibility was analyzed by using ap-
proaches of investment theory. The technical assessment was conducted by focusing 
on a detailed description of flexibility types and appropriate indicators on a subsystem 
level. The authors conclude that a comprehensive flexibility assessment is required. It 
is recommended to assess a PSS´s value by using a combination of NPV and ROA 
that is to be combined with an indicator based approach in order to link strategic and 
operative needs by monitoring and control flexibility and its monetary impact along 
its lifecycle. Due to the special properties of PSS, the existing approaches cannot be 
transferred easily. For example, the influences of customers on process flexibility of 
PSS (production process flexibility, service process flexibility) have to be considered 
by using adequate indicators. From the technical perspective, an adapted definition of 
data gathering is needed for computing problem specific indicators as a task for fur-
ther research. In the economic assessment of flexibility, the focus of future research 
lies on an adequate adaptation of the introduced approaches in order to implement 
specific characteristics and problems of industrial PSS.

Abstract. This paper asks how the system of higher education can support 
graduates in engineering studies to cope with the specific demands of product-
service work systems. The analysis includes two aspects of higher education: The 
implementation of study programs or modules and the competencies required of 
university graduates in product-service work systems. An evaluation of study 
programs and modules of the 300 top universities shows a considerable worldwide 
implementation and a special emphasis given to the subject in Northern European 
countries. A graduate survey with 474 questionnaires conducted among German 
engineers in 2012 shows the increasing demands on employees’ competencies in 
terms of methodical competencies, social competencies, area-specific knowledge, 
professional skills, and self-competencies. This leads to recommendations of how 
to develop these competencies by means of future study programs. 
Keywords: higher education, university teaching, curricula development, 
competencies, Product-Service Systems, Industrial Product-Service Systems.

Introduction 
There is increasing awareness in scientific writing of the economic impact of Product-
Service Systems (PSS) during the last few years [1, 2, 3]. Such systems arise as a result 
of strategies “shifting the business focus from designing and selling physical products 
only, to selling a system of products and services which are jointly capable of fulfilling 
specific client demands” [4]. As an even more specific recent development, there is a 
trend towards Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2), where production and services 
determine each other in a way that leads to “mutual planning, development, provision 
and use” [5]. The key characteristic of IPS2 compared to PSS is that they are typical for a 
Business to Business area, whereas PSS are characteristic for both Business to Consumer 
and Business to Business areas [6]. PSS, and their special form IPS2, are considered key 
drivers for the sustainable growth and competitiveness of companies in the engineering 
sector [1, 2, 7]. Continuous growth depends on certain parameters, including 
technological, managerial and institutional prerequisites [8]. One of these parameters is 

622

the education system, related to the question of how graduate teaching in higher 
education can foster their development. There is currently no systematically acquired 
knowledge in this field, even though the competencies of the workforce have been stated 
as key factors for the long-term success of Product-Service Solutions in a highly 
competitive global market [9].  
A critical analysis with respect to higher education teaching in product-service 
work environments is promising due to the specific challenges for the actors who 
have to deal with the complexity of these work systems. Heterogeneous fields of 
expertise need to be integrated and the customer-driven flexibility of the business 
model increases the coordination requirements of such work systems [10]. This leads 
to our research question: How can and does the higher education system prepare 
graduates in the engineering sector to cope with the challenges of PSS and IPS2 work 
systems? 
The preparation of higher education teaching for PSS and their special form IPS2 
can be analyzed from at least two perspectives. The development of specific programs 
– especially in graduate studies – is one key impact of the university system. The 
second aspect is the broader field of competence development that goes beyond the 
explicit content of a study program and addresses graduates’ ability to adapt to and 
absorb future developments in their field of employment. There has been increasing 
awareness of teaching outcomes in terms of competencies, especially since the 
Bologna reform of university teaching in Europe. Competence development in higher 
education matured as a separate research domain called competence-based education 
[11-12]. It is closely linked with considerations on didactics and new forms of 
teaching, such as research- or problem-based teaching. We consider both study 
programs and competencies as conceptual anchors of our analysis that will be further 
outlined in the next section.  
With reference to the conceptual background, we will introduce our findings in the 
third paragraph, including a worldwide map on PSS- or IPS2-related university 
teaching and a specification of the competencies required especially for such work 
environments. The empirical findings lead to a recommendation of how to further 
improve the preparation of graduates in university teaching for new work systems 
characterized by the integration of products and services.

Conceptual Background 
In order to explore how graduate education contributes to a further development of 
PSS and IPS2 work systems, we integrated the institutionalization of study programs 
as one important input variable in our analysis. Moreover, we considered graduates’ 
competencies as an important output variable of university teaching. This focus is 
aligned with recent concepts and frameworks on teaching in higher education.

In general, teaching is a complex process of transforming inputs, such as the 
curriculum, into desirable learning outcomes [13]. More precisely, student outcomes 
can be defined as “those aspects of the student’s development that the institution 
either does influence or attempts to influence through its educational programs and 
practices” [14, p. 38]. While focusing on student learning, these outcomes concentrate 
on special skills, knowledge and abilities that a student should demonstrate after 
graduating from university [15].  
Broadly speaking, the importance of the input side of the teaching process is not 
questioned [16]. However, the high complexity and the dynamic of modern working 
environments lead to the fact that the question about “What graduates learned in 
higher education” becomes less important compared to the question of “What 
graduates are able to do in their working environments” [17-18]. This ongoing change 
leads to the new output-based orientation of the teaching process and the redefinition 
of the role of students in this process. Each study program should be orientated 
towards the competencies that students should have after their graduation. The 
process of university teaching and development should be led by the key 
competencies which are relevant in today’s working environments. The significance 
of each course must be defined in terms of its contribution to these competencies [19]. 
This reorientation of higher education teaching in Europe is reinforced by the 
Bologna process and is based on the modularization of the curricula [20]. 
Consequently, we are aiming towards an answer to the question: What competencies 
do today’s graduates need for their upcoming tasks and challenges in their job? We 
follow this question with respect to work systems integrating production and services. 
Regarding our focus on upcoming challenges in working environments due to the 
growing importance of PSS and IPS2, individual competencies are considered as a 
prerequisite for an ongoing improvement and development in the engineering sector 
[10]. Since PSS and IPS2 depend on the integration of the customer, provider and 
supplier, bringing together different expertise is a key characteristic of such work 
systems. As a result, there is a high demand for coordination, communication and 
knowledge integration. This is what Blacker [21] characterizes as a communication-
based work system with challenges in integrating the expertise of individuals for 
collective problem-solving activities. “Especially, preventing information losses and 
coordinating across boundaries appear as main problematic inhibitors at the side of 
the supplier, while goal conflicts are addressed for the customer side” [22 with 
reference to 23]. The growing importance of coordination and collaboration in the 
working process indicates a higher relevance of competencies needed to establish, 
manage, maintain, and run heterogeneous, dynamic and sometimes also ambiguous 
systems throughout daily work [22]. Specific competencies of individuals and teams 
with respect to social and cognitive abilities can be considered as even more crucial 
for successful processes and competitive advantages in product-service work 
environments than in systems with a higher degree of division of labor and sequential 
processes. 
Erpenbeck and Rosenstiel [24] define the following competencies as a broader set 
of social and cognitive dispositions that can be specified for certain job environments: 
personal competencies, activity- and implementation-oriented competencies, 

624 
U. Wilkens et al. 
 
professional skills and methodical competencies, and social and communicative 
competencies.  
Personal competencies are the dispositions of a person to reflect on their own 
behavior and to assess their own attitudes and values. They allow their owners to 
learn and develop their motives and talents within their working environments and 
outside these environments.  
Activity- and implementation-oriented competencies are dispositions that allow a 
person self-organized actions directed at the implementation of their intentions, 
projects and plans. This implementation can be important, not only for the person 
themself, but also for other people in their team or in the whole organization. These 
competencies show the capability of a person to integrate their emotions, motivations, 
abilities, and experiences with the other kinds of competencies in order to act 
successfully in their working environment. 
Professional skills and methodical competencies are the dispositions of a person to 
act in a self-organized way by solving factual problems with the help of instrumental 
knowledge, skills and capabilities. These competencies are based on the ability to 
structure and assess one’s own knowledge, on the one hand, and to implement it in 
order to find applicable solutions to different tasks, on the other hand. The 
professional and methodical competencies allow not only the usage of the existing 
methods, but also the modification and further development of these methods 
according to the relevant tasks in the working environment.  
Social and communicative competencies are dispositions allowing their owners to 
act in a communicative, cooperative and self-organized way in their working 
environments. These competencies make a person able to deal with other people 
within a group in a relationship-oriented way.  
This established framework of a four-dimensional competence model that can be 
traced back to Erpenbeck and Rosenstiel [24] allows the presupposition of what 
competencies would be highly relevant in PSS or IPS2. The model faces 
interdisciplinary capabilities of individuals and teams which empower actors to deal 
with new and complex situations within a dynamic working environment. Therefore, 
the model can be used for PSS and IPS2work systems.  
Answering the question of how teaching in higher education can foster the further 
development of engineers’ future working systems requires both a closer look into the 
education system with respect to study programs and modules, on the one hand, and 
how this focus on teaching content is combined with a specification of the 
competencies required for PPS and IPS2 work systems, on the other hand.  
The framework of our analysis is the modified presage-process-product model of 
student teaching and learning [13, 25]. We start with the analysis of the presage or the 
input side of the university teaching process. This side is represented through the 
teaching activities of PSS- or IPS2-relevant content of different universities. It is clear 
that such inputs should play an important role in the development of students’ 
competencies that are important for successful coping with new challenges of PSS 
and IPS2 systems. The second part of our analysis concentrates on the product 
required or output side of the university teaching process. We analyze the relevance 
of different competencies in different engineering working environments depending 
on the estimations of graduates who are employed in such work environments. With

the help of these findings, we will be able to make suggestions along the whole 
process from the input to the output side, while also taking the processes of teaching 
and learning in higher education into account.

Developing Competencies for Product-Service Solutions  
3.1 
The Institutionalization of Related Study Programs 
In order to identify relevant study programs referring to the PSS or IPS² application 
area, we firstly conducted extensive internet research across the 300 highest ranked 
universities using the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) 2011 [26]. 
Even though university rankings, in general, are discussed quite critically due to their 
differing methodologies and scopes [27], they allow a systematic sample selection. 
The ARWU was chosen – instead of other comparable university rankings – due to its 
partial adjustment towards education quality [28] which runs in line with our research 
scope. Employing the top 300 universities of this ranking is supposed to assemble a 
representative sample of the world’s most influential universities. There is a focus on 
the top 300 out of the 500 listed universities since it can be assumed that this group of 
universities will sustain their places in the ranking for a long time and will be 
continuously recognized as influential international universities.  
The goal of the internet research was to detect PSS- and IPS2-relevant content 
within the universities’ curricula. Additionally, we also focused on the universities’ 
PSS and IPS2 research activities, assuming a potential spillover from research into 
teaching, even if these topics have not (yet) been institutionalized within the teaching 
curricula.  
The search itself consisted of four major steps: 
• 
Firstly, we made use of the internet search engine Google by searching for “name 
of the university” and “product service system” as a general framework. 
• 
Secondly, we checked the results for relevant information in terms of PSS or IPS2 
activities at the institutions. 
• 
Thirdly, we took a deeper look at the universities’ own websites by scanning for 
information about “product service system,” “product-service system,” “industrial 
product service system,” and “industrial product-service system.” 
• 
Finally, we accumulated the information collected into the categories Teaching 
and Research and processed our findings into a world map.  
We see that at least 51 (17%) of the top 300 universities are engaged in PSS- or IPS2-
related activities. This indicates a worldwide institutionalization of the subject. 
Thirty-four (11.33%) of these universities are only engaged in research activities 
concerning PSS or IPS2. Nevertheless, this can be regarded as a first step towards an 
institutionalization of PSS- or IPS2-related teaching programs. There are 17 (5.67%) 
of the top 300 universities conducting both research and fully institutionalized 
teaching programs in this field. Twelve (4%) of the world’s 300 best universities 
engage more visibly in teaching activities concerning PSS or IPS2 than in research-
related subjects. The universities engaging in research and/or teaching activities 
concerning PSS or IPS2 are distributed across several industrial states with centers in 
Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia.

Preparing University Graduates for Product-Service Work Environments

The largest number of top universities engaged in PSS or IPS2 research is located 
in the UK. The greatest number of top universities engaging in both research and 
teaching activities is located in Germany (see world map).  
The worldwide distribution of universities with curricula related to “product 
service system,” “product-service system,” “industrial product service system,” or 
“industrial product-service system” shows an already existing high interest in this 
subject. This underlines that there is a common understanding of the relevance of PSS 
and IPS2 issues. At the same time, the results show that countries from Northern 
Europe give especially high emphasis to this topic in their research and teaching 
activities. There is obviously a high awareness of the opportunities leading to a 
competitive advantage from solution-orientated offerings. Concurrently, universities 
from other continents are starting following this trend. A further exploitation of 
product-service solution opportunities worldwide can be expected. 
The results of our analysis show that there are increasing activities in preparing 
students for the challenges of upcoming engineering working environments with 
respect to the input side. The second part of our analysis concentrates on the question 
of what competencies are crucial as teaching output in emerging programs. We 
focused on practitioners who have already been working in the field of PSS or IPS2 
environments for several years to gain systematic knowledge about this perspective. 
There is a focus in this part of the analysis on Germany as the country where teaching 
in the area of product-service solutions is most advanced. There is a comparably 
higher probability of being confronted with PSS or IPS2 work environments and 
demands of PSS or IPS2 work systems in Germany as a necessary prerequisite for the 
second part of our analysis. 
3.2 
Graduates’ Evaluation of Required Competencies in Product-Service 
Work Systems  
In order to analyze the proliferation of changing working environments in the field of 
engineering in Germany and the relevance of different kinds of competencies as 
antecedents for successful working in PSS or IPS2 work systems, we used the data of 
a survey conducted by the HIS Institute for Research on Higher Education (HIS-HF) 
in Germany in 2012. The HIS-HF graduate survey is a systematically conducted 
longitudinal study with the examination year of 1989 as a starting point. It is 
representative for the population of German graduates in engineering studies. The 
survey is conducted in three waves – one year, five years and ten years after 
graduation. We used the data of the third wave, asking participants who graduated 
from their universities in 2001. We selected this group of participants and excluded 
job starters because it allows the acquisition of information about competence 
demands in the engineering sector on the basis of the extended work experience of the 
respondents.  
The survey is based on a broad set of items describing competencies. We selected 
those items from the survey which describe the perceived importance of different 
kinds of competencies enabling participants to act in rather unknown and 

628 
U. Wilkens et al. 
 
heterogeneous work environments as an assumed key prerequisite in PSS or IPS2 
work environments.  
We expected from the results of the following analysis that the participants of the 
survey who work in an environment where the integration of products and services to 
a solution is becoming increasingly important see a higher relevance for the 
competencies we mentioned as critical success competencies in such work systems.  
We subsumed the competence-relevant items under the four dimensions of the 
competence model developed by Erpenbeck and Rosenstiel introduced already [24]. 
The data evaluation is based on these items. The assignments of the items to the kinds 
of competencies mentioned are shown in Table 1.

The α coefficients of area-specific knowledge and of professional skills are lower 
than the conventional level of 0.7 due to the fact that they are complex 
multidimensional facets depending on an individuals’ work-place characteristics and 
not homogeneous constructs.  
New items which are relevant for characterizing solution-orientated product-
service work systems were integrated into the HIS-HF survey for the first time. We 
developed these items on the basis of the theoretically based descriptions of PSS and 
IPS2 work environments and suggested their integration in the survey. HIS-HF 
pretested and accepted the items. With the help of these items, we are able to separate 
those respondents who work in PSS or IPS2 work environments from those who do 
not. The following items have been used to identify the participants of the survey 
working in an environment which shows PSS- or IPS2-relevant characteristics: 
• Within my job, I have to deal with new challenges which often cannot be handled 
by a linear solution.  
• Only the combination of specific knowledge from different experts leads to 
success during my work. 
• The colleagues with whom I work have very different professional backgrounds. 
• The output of my work is required by others before they are able to fulfill their 
tasks. 
Based on the α coefficient of these, the scale amounts to 0.65 and does not reach the 
conventional level of 0.7 so that we could not use these characteristics of the work 
system as a homogeneous construct. However, the results of the factor analysis show 
that all these items load on the same factor with factor loadings ranging from 0.50 to 
0.77. That is why we can conclude that these work characteristics represent one 
factor. 
A total of 734 engineers took part in the survey. The PSS- or IPS2-related job 
characteristic items were answered by 474 (65%) of them. Fifty-two (11%) of the 
respondents were women and 422 (89%) were men; 147 (31%) respondents graduated 
in electrical engineering, 256 (54%) graduated in mechanical and process engineering 
and 71 (15%) graduated in business engineering. The mean year of birth is 1974 and 
the standard deviation is about 2.5 years; subsequently, the mean age is about 38 
years. 
We analyzed the frequency of different elements of the job characteristic items in 
order to discuss to what extent these characteristics are important in German 
engineering working environments. The results of the frequency analysis show that 
166 (35%) participants have to deal with new challenges in their working 
environments which often cannot be handled by a linear solution. A total of 109 
(23%) participants say that only the combination of specific knowledge from different 
experts leads to success during their work; 95 (20%) participants work together with 
experts having very different professional backgrounds; and 76 (16%) say that the 
output of their work is required by others before they are able to fulfill their tasks. 
Therefore, we can conclude that the four characteristics of new engineering working 
environments mentioned above are differently widespread in a considerable number 
of participants’ traditional working environments. The most widespread characteristic 

630 
U. Wilkens et al. 
 
is the necessity of searching for new non-linear solutions. The least widespread 
characteristic in the participants’ working environments is the necessity of providing 
the input for colleagues as an indicator that the components of a solution provided 
determine each other. About ten participants (2%) say that their working 
environments can be characterized by all of the elements mentioned above. These are 
the engineers we consider to be working in environments which can be described as 
more dynamic and challenging environments in terms of specific demands from PSS 
and IPS2 work settings. It becomes obvious that there is a relevance of these job 
characteristics but that the full range of these characteristics so far describes the social 
reality of a rather small group of engineers.  
As a next step of the analysis, we take a closer look at those competencies which 
correlate with these job characteristics in order to answer the question: Which 
competencies should the higher education sector (in Germany) emphasize to prepare 
for PSS or IPS2 work environments and their challenges. In order to tackle this 
question, we conducted a correlation analysis of the job characteristics and of the 
competence items. The results of the correlation analysis show that the factor 
indicating PSS and IPS2 working environments is strongly positively associated with 
the importance and the presence of all kinds of competencies listed in Table 1. The 
correlation coefficient between the PSS- or IPS2-related job characteristics and the 
importance of methodical competencies indicated shows a correlation of 0.31 (p < 
0.01). The job characteristics and the importance of social competencies perceived 
also show a significant positive correlation (r = 0.26, p < 0.01). Furthermore, there is 
a significant positive correlation with the indicated importance of area-specific 
knowledge (r = 0.27, p < 0.01), of professional skills (r = 0.27, p < 0.01) and of self-
competencies (r = 0.24, p < 0.01). 
These results are supported by the results of the linear regressions. Firstly, we used 
the factor indicating PSS and IPS2 working environments as the independent variable 
to predict the perceived importance of different kinds of competencies. The results of 
these regression analyses show that the job factor is significantly positively related 
with the indicated importance of methodical competencies (t = 5.37, p < 0.01, β = 
0.31), of social competencies (t = 4.77, p < 0.01, β = 0.26), of area-specific 
knowledge (t = 4.40, p < 0.01, β = 0.27), professional skills (t = 5.54, p < 0.01, β = 
0.27), and self-competencies (t = 4.76, p < 0.01, β = 0.25). The factor indicating PSS 
and IPS2 working environments turned out to be a good predictor of the relevance of 
these kinds of competencies.  
In summary, it can be said that some elements of PSS or IPS2 job characteristics 
can already be observed in every fourth work-place in the engineering sector in 
Germany, and that about 2% of German engineers have to face all characteristics of 
these work environments as far as they could be included in the HIS-HF graduate 
survey. Engineers working in such environments perceive all kinds of competencies 
concerned as more important than their colleagues working in conventional 
environments in the engineering sector. Due to this reason, we see a necessity and 
also a possibility to highlight the competencies that should be taken into consideration 
in existing and emerging study programs dedicated to PSS or IPS2.

Discussion and Conclusion 
Our analysis shows that even though PSS and their special form IPS2 are considerably 
new subjects in research, they have succeeded in achieving a considerable 
international distribution. A total of 17% of the top 300 universities from four 
continents are engaged in PSS- or IPS2-related activities. Certain teaching activities 
can be identified. The worldwide emphasis given to the subjects can be treated as an 
indicator of its relevance and sustainability. 
It has often been argued that Western European engineering companies could 
strengthen their competitiveness by solution-selling activities [29]. Universities, 
especially those with specific programs in PSS or IPS2, can be considered as 
important partners for this further development. These academic partners can be 
identified and prepared for the related challenges due to their current activities. The 
world map of universities presented can help to locate these academic partners. 
However, it should also be taken into consideration that Western Europe cannot count 
on the uniqueness of its PSS or IPS2 activities and related competitive advantages. 
The relevant knowledge is distributed all over the world.  
The next steps towards a further advancement of PSS or IPS2 teaching programs 
can be supported by the findings of the graduate survey introduced. The survey allows 
the specification of the relevant competencies for work systems integrating 
production and services that should be taken into consideration and made use of in 
existing and emerging teaching activities in higher education. These competencies are 
listed in Table 1. Particular methodological competencies, such as applying existing 
knowledge to new problems – seeing and filling one’s own knowledge gaps, 
analyzing or structuring complexity – or social and communicative competencies, 
such as cooperation, conflict management and leadership, are crucial for coping with 
the challenges of PSS or IPS2 work systems. Consequently, it will be necessary to 
develop interdisciplinary study programs integrating elements from engineering, 
management and social sciences. Moreover, the findings show that it will be 
especially important to give emphasis to teaching methods in higher education that 
should especially foster the methodological and social competencies. At this point, we 
see the chance to create specific learning settings and environments in higher 
education in terms of dealing with complex scenarios, discovering new solutions, 
creating knowledge in collective problem-solving activities, and providing the ability 
to work in very heterogeneous and interdisciplinary teams.  
It could be interesting for future research to compare the perceived importance of 
competencies depending on the years of job experience, and whether there are 
systematic differences between engineers with one, five or ten years on the job. 
Additionally, a comparison between findings concerning engineers and concerning 
other professions, such as business economists, computer scientists or others who are 
supposed to work in solution selling environments with similar characteristics to those 
described for PSS and IPS2, could be considered as fruitful.

Abstract. The performance of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) relies 
– in addition to many technical factors – on the optimal performance of the hu-
man operators. This can be supported through the detection of erroneous beha-
vior and user-centered warnings before injury or damage occurs.  
The detection of such behavior is based on the simulation of cognitive mod-
els which describe behavior as a combination of body movements combinations 
of the operator. A comparison of the simulation with the tracked movements 
leads to the identification and classification of possible dangerous actions of the 
operator. Error codes then trigger action-specific warnings. In addition to the 
warnings, the system automatically generates documentation in the form of ava-
tar videos. These can be used for task demonstration and to ensure the operators 
compliance.  
The paper details the integrative system setup for this erroneous behavior de-
tection and the resulting warning generation. It also demonstrates the integra-
tion of these systems into IPS².  
Keywords: Operating Procedure Monitoring, Preliminary Error Detection, 
Multimodal Warning Strategies, Avatar Instructions.

Introduction 
Current Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) combine the concepts of highly 
customer-adapted products and integrated services. This allows the provision of avail-
ability and performance guarantees for the machine instead of only selling standard 
products. Thus, the integration of services is of main interest for the necessary adapta-
tion of business models and distribution as well as marketing strategies.  
The focus of selling IPS² thereby concerns every single section of the manufactur-
er’s organization and nearly every employee. Therefore, typically reorganization is 
needed to accomplish service tasks for the customer who bought a specific machine 
with guaranteed availability. The employee of the manufacturer requires more specif-
ic and new knowledge about the highly adapted product because in most cases he has 
to fulfill tasks like maintenance or trainings for different customers at different (inter-
national) locations. 

636 
A. Wegerich et al. 
These new business relations between the manufacturer and its customers lead to 
higher commitment on the part of the manufacturer. The manufacturer has to provide 
people who fix problems at anytime and anywhere in the world where its IPS² have 
been sold. For this reason the manufacturer has to train its employees or hire em-
ployees with very specific knowledge about their machines. This makes personnel 
deficits or fluctuation very expensive.  
This paper reports research concerning two specific forms of IPS² enhancements to 
make the IPS² more intelligent and to help the operator at the machine to avoid erro-
neous behavior. Thus, system downtime and costs are reduced by preventing machine 
damages and injuries. The first enhancement consists of cognitive models and its 
simulation as well as sensory data processing for the operator’s movements and ma-
chine data. This together is used to simulate optimal operating procedures which lead 
to the generation of error codes if the interpretation of the movement or machine data 
differs from this procedure or erroneous behavior is likely within the next steps of 
task execution. The error code leads to a specific warning strategy which is presented 
before damage or injury occurs. Based on the optimal task execution also an avatar 
guidance approach is developed to ensure the operators compliance for accomplishing 
the right action. 
The article first presents IPS² background and the states of the art for error detec-
tion in human action recognition as well as for multimodal warnings. The following 
two sections provide details about the two approaches. Section 5 explains the integra-
tion of the two approaches. Section 6 shows the principles and background of the 
avatar documentation method. Finally, a summary and an outlook for further work 
and open issues are given. 
2 
Setting the Scene – Enhancing IPS²  
IPS² are complex constructs which satisfy diverse demands to provide products and 
services in an integrated form. Classic and novel services must be incorporated into 
the organization of IPS² manufacturer and customer and their business models. In 
addition, the product must be adopted in a customer-centered way.  
The IPS² enhancements developed in this research project add components for in-
telligent error prevention mechanisms and technologies to the IPS². They enable the 
avoidance of errors and thus reduce service demands on the part of the customer or 
the supplier, depending on the business model. The enhancements additionally offer 
user-centered and integrated help which does not distract the operator from his or her 
original task and supports his or her knowledge about the task and the machine. By 
doing so the operator and the machine are able to build up the unity IPS² require for 
efficient product lifecycles. Other possible enhancements can be provided by remote 
maintenance systems [3], [4] or ubiquitous knowledge data bases for product and 
service integration. So the available digital information in IPS² is used to offer indi-
vidual support to the operator for specific tasks in different environments [12]. 
 

 Preventing Erroneous Operator Behavior and Supporting Optimal Operating Procedures 
637 
The first enhancement concerns the development of technical components for the 
machine which recognize human actions and compares them to optimal action strate-
gies for given tasks, e.g. for a scheduled maintenance. Thus, the system is able to 
detect errors before damage or injury occurs. The so extended machine generates 
error codes which are further processed by the second enhancement. An operator for 
example takes a wrong tool to tighten a specific screw. The error code for this situa-
tion consists of the machine state (configuration of moveable parts and sensory data), 
the identifier of the executed action, the identifier or the currently executed process 
step, a list of valid actions, an identifier for the error type as well as criticality and 
urgency values of the observed or expected erroneous behavior. 
For recognizing erroneous behavior manual tasks are modeled using the cognitive 
architecture Adaptive Character of Thought – Rational (ACT-R) [1]. The cognitive 
theories incorporated into the architecture allow forecasting of erroneous behavior for 
cognitive reasons. The rules based nature of this architecture allows the modeling of 
tasks with maximum degrees of freedom to the operator, because preconditions define 
whether a rule or action may be executed. When running a simulation of the model 
the next valid actions can be easily recognized by the rules which interact with the 
environment and are verified by the actual actions, making automatic error reporting 
possible. 
The actual human actions can be tracked by employing motion capture suits [2] or 
other technologies to capture human movement and the additional information about 
the environment is provided by sensors of the technical systems, like heat sensors. 
The movement data is further processed to extract gestures or actions from the data, 
using techniques like gesture spotting [5]. This enables the recognition of e.g. screw-
ing actions or grabbing of an object. The recognition can be verified by the simulation 
together with the sensory data.  
The research work for the second enhancement focuses on the user-centered pres-
entation of multimodal and action-specific warnings according to the error code.  
Studies have shown the advantages of multimodal warnings [6]. Thus, warnings are 
presented in multimodal forms and at the location where the wrong action is about to 
happen (action-specific via glove). For the example concerning grabbing the wrong 
tool, a glove the operator wears is able to present a warning light, a vibration, and an 
acoustic sign to bring the possible error to the operator’s attention and helps to resolve 
the situation.  
The second enhancement will allow generic documentation preparation for task 
guidance in an IPS² context. Therefore, a user-centered and digital adaptive solution is 
determined in the form of an avatar. The developed avatar framework provides mod-
ular action entities which can be built up to different kinds of action procedures for 
various tasks and the appropriate guidance. This approach is able to substitute train-
ings and descriptions of tasks in a user adapted form also to reduce service demands.  
3 
Detection of Erroneous Behavior 
The goal of this IPS² enhancement is the recognition of operator errors when execut-
ing a manual process before the erroneous behavior leads to injury, causes damage to 
the technical system, or makes additional repair services necessary. An example of 
such invalid behavior is grabbing an Allen wrench of the wrong size or trying to  

638 
A. Wegerich et al. 
interact with a heat source. When such a situation occurs an error code is transferred 
to the second system enhancement for the generation of warningss (see chapter 4). 
The system for an automatic detection of erroneous behavior or errors consists of 
the simulation of the executed task as wells as data about the human actions and ma-
chine data. Figure 1 illustrates the system concept. The simulation forecasts all possi-
ble actions of the operator and has risk values attached to actions which are error 
prone. The simulated actions are compared with the action of the human operator (see 
below). If the system recognizes a deviation between the actual and the modeled ac-
tions, the discrepancy is evaluated with consideration to the system data, and is classi-
fied  as an error. An error is also reported when the simulation forecasts that an error 
prone action is likely be executed. The kind of (possible) error is described in an error 
code which is transferred to the system part that generates the warnings.

The described components itself incorporate various technologies and subcompo-
nents. The simulation is based on the low-level architecture Adaptive Character of 
Thought – Rational (ACT-R). This architecture is rule-based, making it easy to ac-
count for human flexibility during task execution because only the precondition needs 
to be checked to determine whether a rule may fire. The different components in 
ACT-R allow the simulation of human information acquisition (eyes, ears), informa-
tion processing and memory, the execution of a task, and a representation of the envi-
ronment (machine). On the cognitive level this allows the prediction of improper task 
execution due to memory decay. In the case of action implementation, the time for 
movement data can be estimated and the actions can be subdivided into small steps, 
which make an early recognition possible. Improper actions can be accounted for by 
rules which associate actions under specific environmental conditions (e.g. wrong 
movement in a task step or moving a hand in a hot area). The parallel simulation of

these rules therefore is needed to compare the real detected actions with the correct 
ones to recognize deviations from them. 
For the system which recognizes erroneous behavior by the operator, movement 
data and executed actions need to be supplied. Thus, a motion capturing component is 
part of the system to record the movements of the human operator. For motion capture 
different technologies are suitable (optical, mechanical, inertial sensors, etc.). Within 
this project a motion capture suit and glove are used to get raw data about changes of 
body part locations, e.g. acceleration data from the arm or hand. 
This raw movement data is pre-processed to handle the tolerance of the sensors and 
to compensate small, involuntary movements. In the next step a machine learning 
module segments the data and determines the performed actions, which are then for-
warded to the simulation. To optimize the performance of this system the position of 
the operator in the system is observed by adjusting the set of actions, which need to be 
identified. 
Apart from human data the simulation also needs to monitor the environment. All 
available data about the placement of interaction objects in the environment and sen-
sory data about the system is incorporated in system data. These data are collected by 
connecting sensors to measure heat, positions, status, etc. In the maintenance case we 
used optical sensors, heat sensors, CAD data of the machine (component position 
detection), and the state of the machine. The flow of information is shown in Figure 2.

In summary, this IPS² enhancement consists of sensors for the machine and the 
working environment as well as motion tracking sensors for the operator. The motion 
suite with inertial sensors can be substituted by a different technology, i.e. less intru-
sive optical tracking. In addition to the simulation and the data sources, a computing 
component is part of the system to compare the expected with the executed actions 
and generate a detailed error code in case of erroneous behavior to provide appropri-
ate feedback to the human operator.

Prevention of Erroneous Behavior 
This IPS² enhancement provides assistance for the user to increase the reliability and 
the performance of the whole human-machine system. After the detection of errone-
ous behavior (see chapter 3) the multimodal warning system is able to present a warn-
ing before damage or injury occurs and thus supports the right interpretation of what 
should be done. The time from triggering a warning to its presentation is only a few 
milliseconds. 
Crucial for the prevention of erroneous operator behavior is the time between the 
detection of an error condition and the operator’s interpretation of the risk which is 
connected to it. This IPS² enhancement therefore concentrates on an action-specific 
warning strategy. It presents the warning at the point where the error probably will 
happen and supports the right interpretation of what is wrong and how the right action 
should look like.  
Earlier research results showed that multimodal warnings can have many advan-
tages, like faster detection times [7]. The enhancement uses human-centered studies 
and appropriate results concerning the optimal detection and interpretation of the 
multimodal presentation. Additionally, instructions are designed so that the user satis-
factorily accomplishes his or her task and understands the system better. 
Current warning systems often work with multimodality but do not incorporate 
system components which are able to provide warnings in an action-specific way. In 
detail, action-specific means the presentation of a warning adapted to the situation and 
the current possible error as well as the presentation at the location where the error or 
misbehavior is about to happen. As a result of the non-action-specific warnings the 
detection time is decreased but the interpretation time and quality of the (coded) 
warning is worsened where action-specific warnings can optimize both [7] 
The components of the multimodal warning system are shown in Figure 3. The er-
ror code of the erroneous behavior detection module is transferred to a glove. The 
glove presents the warnings at the point where the error probably will occur (“location 
adapted warning”). Additionally, a warning message is shown on a display informing 
the operator about what is wrong and what the correction would be. The warning 
generator matches the forwarded code with already existing codes in a data base. 
These codes are dependent on criticality and urgency of the current situation taking 
into account the specific operator (e.g. existing knowledge), environmental state (e.g. 
noise level) and machine type.

The glove is worn by the operator and provides three modalities. Two LED rows 
are arranged orthogonally. In this way, visual warnings are easily visible. A speaker 
and a vibrating element are used to transfer sounds and vibrating signals in different 
modes of repetition schemata (see Figure 4). 
 
 
Fig. 4. Warning glove 
The results from the first studies have shown that the approach of using the glove 
and different combinations of modalities is able to support the right interpretation of 
an error or erroneous behavior. Furthermore, the user is able to detect the signal as 
fast as traditional displays in the field of view of the user [10].

Integrative System Setup for IPS² Extensions 
The integrative setup is shown in Figure 5. It connects the two previously described 
system components (see Figures 1 and 3) as extensions of an IPS². Products and ser-
vices are extended with components for the preliminary knowledge about the process, 
the machine, and the human (process model). A computational unit is added to 
process the simulation of this process model, the machine data, and the human data. 
Finally sensors and actuators (LEDs, vibrating element, and speaker) are connected to 
the human and the machine.

So the setup consists of fixed and mobile parts which in most cases are connected 
via wires. Typically all the computer and hardware parts are arranged in a small area 
to keep ways short. But also other (centralized) information processing units are suit-
able. In this case radio connections would be the best solution for all connected sys-
tem parts.  
As shown in Figure 5 the interface is of great importance to transfer the error code 
and feedback information. The error code contains information about the system state, 
like heat sensor reading, the identifier of the invalid action (if any), the identifiers of 
the expected actions, an identifier of the executed sub process, an error identifier, 
information about the place where the erroneous behavior occurred and an estimation 
of the criticality and urgency of the situation. This code is forwarded to the warning 
generator which interprets the error with consideration to the specific operator who is 
executing the task. Proper modalities and warning level are selected and provided to 
the human operator. After the situation was resolved the control returns to the error 
recognition system. 
5.1 
Exemplary Scenario 
This scenario illustrates the detection and prevention of erroneous behavior with the 
task of spindle removal of a micro milling machine. The task involves one operator. 
In the scenario, a technician with one year of working experience will do the task. He 
already performed maintenance on a micro milling machine but is usually responsible 
for other machines. The task can be subdivided into preparation, bringing the machine 
and workplace in condition for removal, and the actual removal of the spindle. The 
actual removal consists of detaching all cables from the spindle, remove fixation and 
the extraction. For this scenario the operator already finished the preparation and the 
removal of the cables and engages in the remove fixation sub process. For this sub 
process the screws of the fixation clamp holding the spindle must be loosened. Fol-
lowing the course of events is described.  
Movement of the operator towards the toolbox is observed, followed by a grabbing 
action, which is according to the simulation. From the sensory data of the toolbox the 
grabbed tool can be identified as a jaw wench. The simulation expected an Allen 
wrench, which is the appropriate tool. The component for error generation then emits 
an error message with the description of the error. In this case the important informa-
tion in the error code is the incorrect action of grabbing a jaw wrench, the correct 
action of grabbing an Allen wrench and that the criticality and urgency of the situa-
tion is low (only time loss and no immediate danger). So, on the glove a low-
frequented tri-modal sign occurs indicating to the operator that something is wrong 
and that he has to take a closer look at the display where at the same time a hint is 
shown. Here, the operator is informed that he has chosen the wrong tool and that he 
has to grab the Allen wrench.  
The technician now loosened all screws of the fixation clamp except one and is 
fixating the spindle with his free hand. The system observes the movement of the 
hand with the Allen wrench towards the last screw and the simulation forecasts the 
removal of the last screw as the next action. Because the technician is unfamiliar with 
the micro milling machine this rule has a high risk value attached and the simulation 
reports that high risk is expected for the following action and an error is generated in

situ service demands, absence, or downtime of the machine and thus to reduce the 
huge costs which are connected with human resource fluctuation or non-available 
workers with a specific knowledge on the part of the manufacturer.  
As a solution the IPS² extensions presented in this article are able to detect and 
prevent errors or erroneous behavior of an operator before they happen. The first ex-
tension enables the misbehavior detection on the basis of cognitive models and  
real-time motion capturing of the operator. The second extension optimizes warning 
strategies based on the current error in an action-specific and multimodal way. There-
fore, a glove is used with visual, vibrating and acoustic signals. Furthermore a docu-
mentation strategy has been developed to assist working processes in the meaning of 
automatically generating avatar video guidance by connecting atomic action steps. 
The integration of the IPS² machine extensions are solved by decomposing the 
components to extend all kind of assistance scenarios where the operator does not 
have enough knowledge to avoid all possible mistakes and thus damages. The exem-
plary scenario showed a possible procedure of detections and warnings to optimize 
the process of changing a spindle on a micro-milling machine. 
In the future, frameworks will be developed to help the manufacturer to set up IPS² 
extensions apart from the example of the micro-milling machine for its own products 
and the costumer’s operators to reduce in situ costs and to reduce the long-term re-
quirements of the customer.

Abstract. A company needs reliable costing information for the service part of 
a Product Service System (PSS). Especially the mandatory customer integration 
introduces uncertainty and requires a costing method designed for services. To 
rate the impact of a customer on service costs we developed our concept of a 
Customer Integration Factor (CIF). With the developed rating method uncer-
tainty in forecasting of service costs should be reduced and the currently miss-
ing customer perspective in service costing will be introduced. In this paper we 
present our evaluation results applying the CIF rating on a service scenario ob-
tained from an existing manufacturer. To test the correctness of our method we 
used a set of generated test data. Our research question is whether costs in a 
Service System as part of a PSS shall be accounted in a different way to inte-
grate customer’s point of view.

Introduction 
The increasing competition on the market and additional customer demand forces 
companies to offer new and innovative product solutions. One consequent is that 
companies offer Product Service Systems (PSS) to increase the value for the cus-
tomer, to stay competitive and to achieve sustainability [1]. The service part of the 
offered PSS confronts companies with special challenges in cost accounting. A prob-
lem is that existing costing methods designed for physical products are not directly 
applicable on services and calculation methods for services do not consider the full 
service spectrum especially customer integration. So there is a lack of costing meth-
ods and cost accounting tool support for services. Furthermore the concept of Service 
Dominant (S-D) Logic and due to mandatory customer integration during the process 
of service co-creation there is a need for a costing method which is designed for ser-
vices [2]. In S-D Logic the most important resources for value co-creation are compe-
tences and knowledge of provider and customer.  
Services have contributed significantly to the economic growth in the last years. 
Regardless of the economic importance of services, a goods-centered view called 
Goods-Dominant (G-D) Logic was the predominant concept when thinking about 
economic exchange. In the G-D Logic goods are playing the central role in economic 

648 
W. Seiringer 
 
exchange while services are just a special form of goods. This fact is considered in the 
concept of Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic where every company is seen as a service 
company and where always services are exchanged [3]. In a goods-centered view, the 
production of goods is separated from the consumption of goods to maximize the 
production output. Such a separation is contrary to customer-oriented marketing as 
well as the S-D Logic [4]. 
A service customer is actively participating in the process of service co-creation by 
providing external factors [5]. During the process of service co-creation, a Service 
System is formed [7]. In this Service System both partners provide resources which 
are combined to co-create the demanded service. Human resources are the most im-
portant resource and cost factor in the context of such a Service System. The amount 
of the required resources depends directly on the provided external factors. Conse-
quently without integration of external factors, a major cost-influencing and uncer-
tainty factor is not being taken into account. This decreases reliability and value of 
service cost information.  
Given these assumptions, we investigate whether costs in a Service System as part 
of a PSS shall be accounted in a different way to reflect the change in view. We also 
want to find out how the consequences of customer participation can be measured. 
Activity-based costing models seem to be appropriate at a first glance. We argue that 
an extension is necessary, because during the process of co-creation resources of ser-
vice provider and customer are required. Furthermore, activities performed by the 
customer are not under full control and therefore uncertainty has to be considered. 
Our target is the development of a rating for customer participation in the process 
of service co-creation to reduce the uncertainty introduced by the customer in fore-
casting of service costs. This rating helps to consider customer’s activities (external 
factors) and customer’s point of view. The research question is whether the developed 
rating for customer participation provides accurate results and information about the 
degree of customer participation. We also want to find whether our developed rating 
can help to reduce uncertainty in forecasting of customer participation. We illustrate 
our developed rating method in a scenario derived from an existing manufacturing 
company. This paper describes the evaluation of our rating method using self gener-
ated test data and the application on our service scenario. 
2 
Scenario 
Service provider and service customer provide input and cooperate in the process of 
service co-creation. For our paper we investigate a maintenance/repair service for 
medical devices which is offered from an existing manufacturer. The depth and in-
tense of customer’s participation depends on the provided resources from a customer. 
With a valid Service-Level-Agreement (SLA) the service provider has to bear a part 
or the full costs for a repair or maintenance of a medical device. Otherwise the cus-
tomer must accept the costs.  
In our scenario the customer contacts the provider if maintenance is due or a prob-
lem occurs. The customer care classifies and documents the inquiry and checks who 
has to pay. After acceptance spare parts and human resources are organized and sent 
to the customer. Finally after repair an invoice can be submitted to the customer. See 
also Fig. 1 for details.

traditional business models.” [1]. Target of Product Service Systems is to „…‘sale of 
use’ rather than the ‘sale of product’.” [6]. Our used maintenance service is an exam-
ple for a PSS where a physical component and a service offer a unique and specific 
value for a customer. In the co-creation of the offered service a customer and a ser-
vice provider are involved. Compared to the production of physical products the role 
of the customer is somewhat different. The integrative nature of services requires an 
active participation of the customer in the process of service co-creation. 
Compared to goods it is said that services have some special characteristics. These 
are inseparability, perishability, heterogeneity and uncertainty [8]. Inseparability  
describes the simultaneous production and consumption of services. The customer 
defines when the service production starts and when the customer is needed by the 
provider during the co-creation process. Perishability describes the fact that a service 
is not storable. This implies complications to plan resources for service co-creation. 
The heterogeneous nature of services makes it difficult to standardize the service co-
creation because services are often produced only once. 
3.1 
Service Co-creation 
The output and process of service co-creation depends on the mandatory customer 
integration. The integration is expressed in form of external factors provided by the 
customer [5]. 
Service co-creation can be separated into three different parts. These are produc-
tion factors, factor combination and form of output [11]. The final output of service 
co-creation can be something tangible like a repaired device or just information about 
a failed repair. The production factors are all the entities which are necessary to co-
create a service. The production factors are split up in internal and external factors. 
Basically, a production factor can be something tangible or intangible for example a 
defective device, information or the customer who is necessary to create the service. 
The internal factors are those factors that are provided by the service provider and the 
external factor are supplied by the service customer. It is not possible for the service 
producer to produce or buy an external factor on the market. This means the external 
factor and also the associated knowledge is under control of the service customer. 
Different customers mean different activities providing different external factors. The 
service provider is forced to integrate it into the process of service co-creation to pro-
vide the demanded service. Because of the important role of an external factor, it is 
necessary to integrate it into the costing of services. During the co-creation different 
activities are carried out to combine internal and external factors (factor combination) 
and to obtain the desired output. This means also that both sides (customer and pro-
vider) are integrating resources into the co-creation process. To obtain the whole ser-
vice costs, we have also to account costs for the customer. This allows afterwards 
service cost comparison between different customers [12], [13], [14]. 
Three kinds of uncertainty in service co-creation are disposal uncertainty, produc-
tion uncertainty and integration uncertainty. Disposal uncertainty occurs when the 
service customer knows the quantity, quality, time and location of the external factor, 
but the service provider is not sure whether the customer can provide it. Production

uncertainty describes problems creating the external factor. Integration uncertainty  
regards problems of how to integrate the external factor into the production process of 
the service provider [9]. 
4 
Customer Integration Factor (CIF) 
The target of our Customer Integration Factor (CIF) is to get a rating for integration 
intensity. We try to measure the expected resource consumption (pre-calculation) and 
the real resource consumption (post-calculation). As mentioned we consider a cus-
tomer as the dominant uncertainty factor in the process of service co-creation. In our 
approach a service is co-created by a set of activities carried out to fulfil customer 
satisfaction with a tangible or intangible output. These activities are not under full 
control of the provider and thus uncertainty about the performance and service costs 
have to be considered. We also consider that knowledge about external activities is 
often vague and not precise. This assumption is based on the difficulty to standardize 
a service co-creation process. 
A service model for our CIF rating can include activities from the customer do-
main. Consequently a CIF rating can be split up into provider and customer domain. 
For a service it is only necessary to sum up these two values, see also Fig. 2. Our 
considerations are based on the assumption that provider integration is also required 
into activities on customer domain. An example is when a technician repairs a defec-
tive device at the customer and the customer supplies resources during the repair 
process. When activities on customer domain are required for a service provider and 
both partners are involved they are included into a service model. Activities on cus-
tomer domain without active provider participation are not part of the investigated 
service model. These activities are excluded because we regard them as not cost ef-
fective and they have no direct relation to a specific service model. 
We talk about a high customer integration level when a service provider is forced 
to integrate a customer relatively deep into the own value chain which causes higher 
resource costs compared to a low integration. For example when a service case can be 
solved by a helpdesk employee the customer integration is low compared to the case 
when an additional technician or expert is required to solve this service case.  
A central point of our rating is the correlation between the CIF and service activi-
ties, see Fig. 3. The CIF is designed to be independent from an activity but it is related 
to it and it is used to measure the customer’s impact on a single activity or a complete 
service. The pre-calculated activity utilization represents the expected resource con-
sumption and consequently the costs for an activity. The sum of the involved activi-
ties corresponds to the pre-calculated service costs. During service co-creation data 
about the performed activities are recorded from which the real value of the CIF pa-
rameter and activity utilization can be derived. The recorded data are used to make a 
post-calculation of real service costs. The results of pre- and post-calculation can then 
be compared and represent valuable costing information including a rating of the 
customer’s service participation in form of our CIF value.

and measures how deep external 
activities must be integrated into the value chain of during process of service co-
creation. We consider that with increasing value chain depth resource costs for inte-
gration of external activities rise. This means Idep value for an activity allows to 
make an association to responsible resource and related resource costs. This is an 
important correlation for the comparison of pre- and post-calculation. From Idep we 
can derive which kind of a resource is required e.g. a technician or a helpdesk em-
ployee. An Idep value increases or decreases with the corresponding value chain level 
and is derived from the associated resource. Idep values are individual for each ser-
vice scenario of a company.

external activities are part of the service co-creation. Basically Idur is declared as time 
e.g. minutes. Idur is used to add additional resources to the time equation which are 
not covered by the standard service process. This can be done for individual custom-
ers or customer classes. Idur was added to get a lever which can be used to increase or 
also decrease the service costs independent from the standard service process. This 
can be necessary when the standard activity time is too low or too high for a cus-
tomer. With Idur it is also possible to modify a CIF value and the other three parame-
ters remain unchanged. This can be necessary for specific business scenario. 
For a service activity the pre- and post-calculation CIF is computed using Formula

CIF Evaluation 
Based on the described service scenario we have evaluated our CIF rating. The used 
service process consists of 32 different activities. Based on this modelled service 
process we have generated random test data for 10 different service co-creations. 
Altogether we have generated 320 different CIF values for 32 different activities. 
Each service co-creation consists of simulated pre- and post-calculation data. 
We used the following restrictions for test data generation for CIF parameters: Idep 
is between 0.01 and 10, Iint is between 0 and 1, Ifre is between 0 and 10 and Idur 
between is 0 and 180. These restrictions are based on results we have derived from a 
previous sensitivity analysis. We used a sensitivity analysis to find out which parame-
ter ranges lead to the most realistic CIF values. From this sensitivity analysis we also 
know that Idur is the most dominating CIF parameter when the CIF parameter is high. 
The selected CIF parameter restrictions are not applicable for all service scenarios and 
have to be defined during the service modelling step. Especially the Idep value is 
specific for each company because it depends on the associated value chain level of a 
corresponding resource e.g. a technician has a higher Idep value as a helpdesk em-
ployee. Iint will always between 0 and 1 because a resource cannot be utilized more 
than 100 %. The height of Ifre depends on the service processes of a company and 
how the activity flow is organized. Idur depends on the related activity and service 
scenario. For example if the standard activity time is high enough it is not necessary 
to increase it by using the Idur value. 
To evaluate our CIF rating we have tested the following hypothesis: 
H0: The CIF rating indicates the intensity of customer integration and provides data 
about resource utilization and kind of required human resources. From the kind of 
required human resources we can derive resource costs and consequently service 
costs.

Result Discussion 
In this section we describe our evaluation results and if we could validate our hy-
pothesis. Please note in Fig. 4 and Table 1 the results of a whole service/service co-
creation are documented but using our complete output dataset a drill down to a single 
activity and CIF parameter value is possible. The following information can be de-
rived from our simulated service co-creation data: 
 
• Individual CIF parameter ratings can be computed for pre- and post-calculations 
which can be traced from a service down to an individual activity. An important 
requirement for cost traceability in cost accounting. Our approach provides a cross 
domain CIF rating and independent CIF ratings for customer and provider domain.

• Based on Idep it is possible to derive estimated and real value chain level and con-
sequently which kind of human resource is required. The connection between value 
chain level and human resource is possible because in our service model we assign 
each activity and each human resource such a level. 
• We also can derive the estimated and real resource consumption for the Iint pa-
rameter. Real resource consumption can be derived from the time an employee 
needs for an activity. These data are usually provided by an external information 
system like an Enterprise-Resource-Planning (ERP) System. For our evaluation we 
have simulated these data. The same data can be used to compute Ifre and Idur for 
a post-calculation comparison. Consequently we can derive the information how 
often an activity (Ifre) was actually part of a service co-creation and if extra time 
was required (Idur).  
 
 
Fig. 4. Comparison of pre- and post-calculation data for simulated service co-creations (² Pre-
Calculation, ³ Post-Calculation) 
To answer our hypothesis H0 we use the results illustrated in Fig. 4 and Table 1. 
On the Y axis of Fig. 4 the computed pre- and post-calculation CIF values are repre-
sented. This CIF value includes customer and provider domain and is the average CIF 
value of all individual service activities. The X axis illustrates the 10 different service 
co-creations we have simulated. In Table 1 a pre- and post-calculation summary in-
cluding all 10 simulated service co-creations and customer and provider domain is 
illustrated. From our test results, see also Fig. 4 and Table 1, we can derive that a pre- 
to post-calculation difference is based on the change of the underlying CIF parameters 
and it is possible to trace this change down to a single activity and CIF parameter 
value. For example the post-calculation value of SCC2 is significant higher than the 
pre-calculation value. From Table 1 we can derive an increase in the post Idur value.

From our test dataset we also can derive that SCC6, SCC8 and SCC10 have nearly 
similar pre- and post-calculation. This means the forecasted CIF value corresponds to 
CIF values after service co-creation. Because of this traceability it is possible to com-
pare our estimated CIF rating with a real CIF value which is based on objective re-
spectively historical data. And consequently our CIF rating is a measurement which 
indicates the intensity of customer integration. As described at the beginning of this 
section we can also derive data about actual resource utilization and the kind of re-
quired resources. Based on these assumptions, we can answer our hypothesis  
positively.

Conclusions 
In a Service System as part of a Product Service System a customer introduces uncer-
tainty about performance and costing. Our developed Customer Integration Factor 
(CIF) is a rating to support a service provider in cost accounting and capacity plan-
ning to overcome these problems. Our CIF rating is based on four different and inde-
pendent parameters trying to characterise customer’s impact and point of view in a 
service co-creation process. We have presented our CIF rating based on self generated 
test data and have used them to evaluate our stated hypothesis positively. 
Our CIF rating provides useful and realistic data about resource consumption and 
required human resources. It is also possible to conclude which competencies have to 
be provided by customer and provider to co-create a service to the estimated costs. 
The CIF rating is primarily designed for cost accounting of a service provider. Due to 
customer associated costing information a CIF rating can also be used in contract 
negotiations to offer a price which depends on the CIF rating. A low CIF rating means 
higher costs for the customer and a high CIF rating causes higher costs for the

provider. Based on our evaluation results we can conclude that our CIF rating can be 
used as the claimed extension for Activity-Based Costing. The integration of CIF into 
Activity-Based Costing is part of our current research work. The CIF is a practical 
measure for the level of customer participation and the comparison of estimated and 
real costing data. Data provided by our CIF approach can be used to reduce uncer-
tainty in service costing. 
A next step in our research work is to provide real costing data about service co-
creations for pre- and post-calculation. These data will be provided by an ERP-
System. First integration tests with an existing ERP-System have been successfully 
completed. To improve pre-calculation ratings the integration of historical data is also 
planned. The integration of our CIF rating in our developed Cost Model for Services 
(CMFS) is part of our ongoing research work. Finally the CIF rating will be a part of 
the CMFS a costing method designed for services that covers the service modelling 
and costing tasks.
