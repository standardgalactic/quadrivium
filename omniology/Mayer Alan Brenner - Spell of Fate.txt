Prologue
“AUNTIE LEEN! AUNTIE LEEN!
Look what I found!”
Auntie Leen,
also known as the
Keeper of the Imperial Archives, raised
her eyes above the lenses of her read-
ing glasses as the three-year-old ﬁgure
of her nephew skidded to an uncertain
halt next to her desk. In the midst of
a frenetic bustle of waving arms she
could see that both hands were empty,
and the pockets exhibited no more
than their typical bulge.
“Very well,”
said Leen. “I’m looking. What are you
hiding, and where are you hiding it?”
He was tugging insistently at her
hand. “Here! Come here!”
Robin had been rummaging some-
where off in the back, playing hide-
and-seek with himself among the un-
even aisles and coating himself with

his usual cloud of grime. With her free
hand, Leen slid an acid-free marker
into the ancient book and closed the
crumbly cover, leaving it perched on
the reading stand, and picked up her
lantern. Although her work area was
liberally furnished with candles, thus
slowing the deterioration in her eye-
sight, the deeper reaches of the archive
had only the illumination one brought
to them. How had Robin been able to
see whatever he’d discovered?
As Robin trotted ahead of her off
into the darkness, a blue glow spread
out ahead of him, lighting his way
through the crates and leaning piles
of scrolls and books. Leen scowled to
herself.
She must be getting prema-
turely dotty, on top of blind, or perhaps
it was mere engrossment in the book,
although that was an excuse with more
charity than Leen was usually willing

to allow herself. Nevertheless, absent-
mindedness was the least dangerous
explanation she could claim.
Putter-
ing about in the dust while mumbling
non sequiturs was professionally ex-
pected of an archivist, but when you
stopped backing it up with a lucid
mind it meant trouble. One day you’re
forgetting the trick tunic you yourself
had given the boy with the very goal
of making it safer for him to prowl
through your domain, as she had done
at his age when it was her grandfa-
ther at the great desk, and soon you’ve
advanced to fuddling the sequence for
disarming the door wards, with the
immediate sequelae of an expanding
cloud of archivist-shaped vapor and, of
course, the election of a new archivist.
Robin pulled up next to a long spill
of books and more than a few freely
ﬂoating pages and stood hopping im-

patiently from foot to foot.
The glow
from the runes on his shirt diffused out
through a hanging cloud of fresh dust.
Come to think of it, Leen did vaguely
remember a crash and thud some ten
pages earlier in her own reading, but it
hadn’t seemed nearly serious enough
to rouse her. Leen took a look around.
They appeared to have arrived at a
wall, or at least a room-sized pillar.
There were many similar spots around
the catacombs. “Show me what you’ve
found, Robin,” Leen said patiently.
Robin ﬂopped down on his knees and
felt around under the next-to-lowest
shelf.
The bottommost shelf was a single
thick slab of wood extending to the
ﬂoor, and the next shelf above it was
only a book’s-span higher, so Robin was
about the largest person who would
have been able to discover something

that far down.
Three or four books
from the lowest shelf had been re-
moved, judging by the gaps in the line
of snugly ﬁtting spines; without the
added clearance, even Robin’s three-
year-old-sized arm wouldn’t have had
space for maneuver.
“Watch!” Robin
commanded.
Leen barely heard a soft click. The
bookcase made a much louder creak
and pivoted slowly away from them
into the wall. An opening large enough
for a person of Robin’s size appeared on
the right side, then continued to widen
until a Leen-and-a-half could have ﬁt
comfortably through. Robin took hold
of her hand again and dragged Leen
toward it.
How long the shelves and
books had been there was anyone’s
guess. Leen had found a journal kept
by the fourth archivist before her own
tenure which set forth his theories. He

had been the only member of his partic-
ular dynasty, if she recalled correctly,
which explained his works not being
handed down through the line as her
own family had done, although in his
case that was not the only plausible
explanation.
On the basis of ﬂimsy
(not to say cryptic) evidence he had
speculated that the structure of the
archive catacomb itself dated from the
time of the Dislocation, if not before.
Leen had her doubts.
After all, the
same archivist had apparently gone
loony himself soon after writing his
conjectures, closing his career by trig-
gering the trivial third-bend gate and
letting loose a construct that had taken
half the palace strike team and three
senior-level magicians to dispel.
His
ﬂattened image was still embedded
in the wall just past the bend, the
expression on the stretched face oddly

untroubled. Her grandfather had hung
a tapestry over it.
Behind the sliding bookcase was a
narrow alcove and the top of a tightly
wound circular stair. Leen followed the
unstoppable Robin down it, refusing to
give in to a sudden maternal rush and
tell him to watch his step.
She kept
her left hand on the central support
pole and glanced up periodically as the
stairs wound around it; it was fully
two complete turns, or perhaps even
a quarter more, before they reached
bottom.
Leen had no idea where they were,
compared to the overall layout of the
Archives and the catacombs and the
palace complex as a whole. The palace
was the kind of place where outside
and inside measurements rarely added
up, anyway, with the discrepancy as
likely as not to indicate that the inside

dimension was signiﬁcantly the larger.
Still, the Archive occupied the lower
levels of its corner of the complex, so it
appeared reasonable to presume that
the staircase had taken them down
into the midst of solid rock.
Or into
what she had previously assumed, for
lack of any particular reason to think
otherwise, was solid rock.
The ﬂoor was cold and certainly felt
like unbroken bedrock rather than
some construction team’s marble or
concrete sub-basement.
Leen was
no longer quite as willing to give it
the beneﬁt of doubt as she had been
even moments before, though.
The
other two features of the room were
suggestive.
One was the wall that
faced her at the bottom of the stair. It
too was solid, and cold, and obviously
thick, but unlike the ﬂoor, it was metal.
Metal. Not a crude iron alloy or a thin

beaten sheet of copper or some lump-
ish bronze implement or even a piece
of the newer structural steels, either,
but a deadly serious, absolutely ﬂat,
medium-gray slab that reﬂected its
dull sheen beneath the centuries’-long
accumulation of sifted dust. She had
never seen a piece of metal like that
in her life. As far as Leen knew, there
had never been a piece of metal like
that anywhere in the world. Since the
Dislocation, of course. Although there
was no evidence of hinge, lock, or con-
trol, Leen was certain the slab of metal
was a door.
It wasn’t a certainty born of unfet-
tered intuition.
The wall adjoining
the metal one on its right had its own
feature.
From the level of her waist
to a spot above her head and for a
span of an arm-and-a-half or so in
width, the solid rock wall, retaining

the same texture and feeling of cold
stone,
turned inexplicably transpar-
ent behind its coating of ﬁlth.
Leen
slid a ﬁnger through the grime.
As
the clear rock became clearer behind
her ﬁnger, she could see that her ini-
tial impression was no mirage.
The
transparent area glowed a pale green,
the green washing over her ﬁnger in
a faint necrochromatic smear. Where
her ﬁngertip pressed against the wall a
brighter green spot appeared beneath
it.
She brought her eye close to the
smudge her single wipe had left.
Although it was difﬁcult to tell ex-
actly how thick the crystal actually
was, it was incontrovertibly not thin.
The depth of her forearm, at least.
That it did have a far side, though,
was also evident, since Leen could see
something beyond it - a circular spot
of green, coin-sized.
A light.
Not a

ﬂame, or a sorcerous torch, or a rune
like the ones on Robin’s tunic, but a
light of some different type entirely, a
light that glowed its perfect, unceasing,
monochromatic glow in the darkness
where no eye had seen it for-
The light turned orange,
ﬂashed
once. Then it winked off.
Leen’s head snapped back as though
the light had leapt forward through
the crystal and slapped her instead.
She shook her head once, trying to
still through sympathetic magic, she
supposed, her whirling thoughts. She
looked down at Robin; he was happily
pounding away at the metal door, mak-
ing not the slightest dent or sound,
except for the very mild thump of
his small hands against the mate-
rial.
Leen discovered she was rather
proud of him, even in the midst of her
quite un-Archivist-like mental turmoil.

Even as the young child he was, he was
revealing the appropriate inclinations
of a ﬁrst-class Archivist himself. One
of them, unfortunately, was dredging
up things better left hidden. Still, he
had most likely ﬁnished his part; now
it was her turn. Leen told herself to re-
member to get him something special
for bringing her such an interesting
puzzle.
Interesting?
Well, this was
interesting. Indeed, it was more than
interesting.
Something ancient was
still alive in there.

Chapter1
IT SEEMED LIKE THE FIRST DE-
CENT SLEEP he’d had in ages.
Of
course, his standards had grown sig-
niﬁcantly more lax since being on the
road, but even so you could scarcely
deny -
Again, a boot tried to separate his
ribs.
Again?
Jurtan Mont tried to
think back into the immediate past.
Something must have roused him far
enough out of sleep to kick his mind

into gear. Could it have been the same
foot? And if so, whose foot was it?
“Come on, get up already.”
The voice was unfamiliar.
Jurtan
cracked an eye and craned his neck
around.
The shaggy ﬁgure with its
unkempt beard that loomed over him
in the predawn murk was not one he
recognized either.
But his warning
sense hadn’t given him an alarm, and
he hadn’t been robbed and strung up
in his sleep.
“Who are you?” Jurtan
said.
“Who do you think I am?” the unfa-
miliar ﬁgure said irritably.
“Shoulda
slipped a knife through your belly in-
stead of just a friendly boot.
That
might sharpen one thing about you
once and for all, since I’ve just about
given up on your mind.”
The ﬁgure might be new, but Jurtan
was well and fully intimate with the ir-

ritation. “Max?”
Maximillian
the
Vaguely
Disrep-
utable, looking more than ever like his
sobriquet, grunted down at him. “Five
minutes, then we exercise.”
Jurtan piled out of his bedroll.
It
was chilly out in the air, but at least
the dew hadn’t frosted over on his face.
“How long do we have to keep doing
this for? How long until we get some-
where?”
“Never fails, does it,” Max muttered.
“Awake for ten seconds and the ﬁrst
thing he does is start to complain.”
“But we aren’t just going to keep
traveling forever, are we? When do we
get to someplace we want to be?”
“We are someplace.”
“No, I mean -”
“So do I.” Max raised an eyebrow and
directed his gaze meaningfully over Ju-
rtan’s shoulder. When they’d stopped

after dark the previous evening they’d
gone just beyond the line of trees that
marked the margin of the road before
settling themselves down. During the
night, Jurtan had rolled up against
what he’d thought, in the gloom of
sleep, was a hard tree. It wasn’t a tree.
It was a low cairn of stones, with a
small signpost on top. He went around
to the front and squinted at it.
The
arrow-end of the sign pointed ahead
down the road in the direction they
had been traveling. The legend on the
sign read “PERIDOL.”
Jurtan grunted. “It doesn’t say how
far.” It did seem like they’d been travel-
ing forever. “How long has it been since
we slept in a bed?”
“Day before yesterday.”
“Really?” Well, okay, maybe.
Still,
it had to be more than two weeks
since they’d made it out of the swamp;

maybe as much as a month.
If Jur-
tan had had anything to say about it,
they’d never have gone into the swamp
in the ﬁrst place, especially since all
they had to show for it was a sack
of moldy papers neither one of them
could read.
Of course, if Jurtan had
anything to say about anything, he’d
be anywhere at the moment but out
at ﬁve-thirty in the morning on some
nameless road in some useless country-
side on the way to somewhere he had
not the slightest interest in arriving
at. With a maniacal self-improvement
freak. Jurtan was still surprised Max
didn’t make the horses do calisthenics
right along with the two of them.
To his credit, if you were in a pos-
itive frame of mind, you could note
that Max never sat on the sidelines
just calling instructions to Jurtan. Ju-
rtan scowled at his own thought as he

laced his ﬁngers together behind his
back and began his ﬁrst ten-count of
creaking his way over backward. That
wasn’t a positive at all; all it meant
was that Max pushed both of them as
hard as he pushed himself. “What do
you think you’re glaring at?” Max said,
ﬁnishing his own back-bend, holding
it, and then moving his upper body
up and over in a slow lithe curl that
culminated with his nose touching his
thighs and his arms pointing straight
ahead of him behind his inverted back.
“Why do we have to do this every
day?” Jurtan grunted a moment later,
coming back upright and pausing be-
fore doing the whole thing over again.
“We’re already in shape. Okay, maybe
I wasn’t when we left Roosing Oolvaya
but I am now, so -”
“You’re in shape now? Good, then we
can go on to the next level. There’s no

standing still in this outﬁt.” Max tilted
backward again and Jurtan reluctantly
followed.
Max
had
already
told
him
that
standing still meant going back; that
was aphorism number ten-thousand
thirty-three.
Thirty-four?
If Max
tossed him another Rule to Live By
today Jurtan thought he’d ... well, it
wouldn’t be pretty.
It wouldn’t be so bad if Jurtan’s mu-
sic sense didn’t seem to agree with
Max. Well, it might be as bad physi-
cally, but at least he wouldn’t have to
accept the fact that his own body was
in league against him too.
He didn’t
care at this stage if something was
good for him or not. So what if he ac-
tually did feel better than before he’d
met up with Max and Shaa?
Great,
he was in touch with his body, he had
muscles and supple joints, his coordi-

nation had improved and he had a new
repertoire of skills. All this had done
was give him a new appreciation of the
under-recognized appeal of sloth as a
lifestyle.
A ﬂugelhorn honked querulously at
him from the back of his head. That
was another thing - what was the good
of an extra sense that spent most of its
time editorializing? Anybody who had
a conscience had to be used to having it
tell its owner what it thought of them,
but Shaa (who was supposed to know
about things like that) had never heard
of one that orchestrated its critical com-
mentary with multi-part harmony and
a comprehensive palette of tonal colors.
Of course, the standard wisdom on
consciences was that they concentrated
on reactions to issues of right and
wrong, weighing in with a compul-
sion to do right and feelings of guilt

if you violated a previously recognized
ethical principle.
What a conscience
wasn’t supposed to do was step out
proactively, jumping in with helpful
hints and suggestions of its own when
it hadn’t been asked to do anything
more than shut up. In fact, shutting
up was the one thing Jurtan’s sense
had thus far refused to do.
On the other hand, Jurtan wasn’t
complaining, especially now that he’d
reached an accommodation with his
resident talent.
In the old days of
all of several months ago, his musi-
cal accompaniment had been jealous
to a fault. Back then, as soon as Jur-
tan had heard music from outside his
head - music that someone else was
actually playing - his eyes would glaze
and his mind would grind to a useless
stop.
Eventually he’d come back to
consciousness with a blank gaze and

no idea where he was. Sometimes he’d
even be jerking and kicking, too, or
worse. It had been pretty embarrass-
ing, and sometimes kind of dangerous
as well. After all the training and the
practicing, though, that didn’t happen
anymore.
Max ﬁnally called a halt.
Jurtan
felt tingly and fully wrung out, but of
course the day was really just starting.
Back in the grove of trees and parallel
to the road was a stream. The horses
eyed Jurtan suspiciously as he eased
down to the water; they hadn’t quite
forgiven either Jurtan or Max for their
experience in the swamp.
Max had
been eyeing the horses back. For Max’s
own part, the look on his face implied
he’d been considering whether he was
going to continue viewing the horses
as part of the team, rather than as
a source of ready cash or, in a so-far

unexperienced emergency, as dinner
or lunch. The horses and Max had for
the moment ﬁsh-eyed each other to a
standstill.
Nothing snapped at Jurtan out of
the water, and a quick splash took
some of the edge out of his own snap-
pish mood. He was almost back to their
small camp when he saw the strange
device standing near to the shoulder
of the road at the edge of the treeline
thirty paces or so west, in the direction
of Peridol.
“What’s that?” said Jurtan.
It cer-
tainly wasn’t another signpost, unless
it was pointing the way to a place you
couldn’t get to on a horse, and not a
place merely across the ocean either.
One of the trees, a small sapling really,
had been stripped of its side branches,
leaving little more than a wooden rod
protruding upward from the ground to

the height of Jurtan’s head, a rod with
a prominent root system still anchor-
ing it to the ground. A carved icon had
been strapped to the top of the tree fac-
ing the road and was doubly secured
there with a peg. Jurtan couldn’t make
out any details of the carving since a
wisp of ground fog was still clinging to
the icon in a soft glow.
“Better stay away from it in that
state of mind,” Max called over.
“Stay away from what?” muttered
Jurtan.
“I’m not a kid.” Ignoring
the sudden blare of discordant brass
and the familiar snare-drum roll that
usually warned him when something
worth paying attention to was about
to happen, he aimed a kick at the pole.
Without quite knowing how it had hap-
pened, Jurtan found himself for a brief
instant hanging upside down in the
air, where he had been dragged when

something that felt like an enraged
beehive had latched onto his foot and
lashed it up over his head.
Then he
was sprawled out on the dirt ﬁfteen
feet away, at the end of a ﬁve-foot fur-
row, with his face covered with mud
and his leg throbbing and tingling as
though Max had had him exercising
for three days straight without a rest
break.
Jurtan got an elbow under
him, wiped dirt out of his eyes with an
equally ﬁlthy hand, and spit loam out
of his mouth.
Max was standing nearby looking
the shrine over with a professional eye,
but from a prudent distance.
“What
did you think was going to happen?”
Max said. “It’s an active offering to an
active god, looks like the Protector of
Nature.
Whoever set it up obviously
had the concept a little vague, since
they mutilated a tree to do it instead

of just honoring something green in its
natural state, but I guess the Protector
wasn’t being too picky that day either,
or maybe she was just hungry. You’re
just lucky it didn’t call an enforcer.”
Jurtan dragged his head free of the
dirt and sprawled up to a sitting po-
sition. “You wouldn’t have let me get
near it if it would have set off some-
thing real bad.”
“Oh, you think so,” said Max, “do
you.”
“Not if it would have called attention
to you, no I don’t.”
The kid was probably right but that
didn’t mean Max had to let him know
he knew it. Give him an inch and, well,
who knew where you’d end up.
Max
gave Jurtan a hand instead and pulled
him to his feet.
“Get yourself put to-
gether again while I ﬁnish breakfast.
We still have some eggs from that last

village.”
Even in his newly reinstated morose
mood, Jurtan had to admit that one
of Max’s other talents was knowing
how to make the most of cuisine on the
road. With some decent food inside of
him and after his second bath of the
morning, Jurtan was also more willing
to take a longer view of his situation.
He was prepared to acknowledge that
the pace Max had been setting since
Iskendarian’s swamp was by no means
a killing one even if it wasn’t down-
right leisurely.
They’d been in and
out of several countries and city-states
since then, wasting a fair amount of
time talking and hobnobbing in towns
and farms.
They’d even made a few
outright side trips to check out local
legends or hot spots, and in one case
to visit a ruined castle where Max had
climbed a toppled mound of wall-stones

festooned with moss and trailing ivy
to declaim several stanzas of ancient
poetry.
Far too many stanzas, if you
asked Jurtan, who had never been
a big fan of high literature.
When
you added it up, though, you had to
conclude that they’d been staying on
back roads and avoiding the larger
thoroughfares.
On the more traveled
routes there would have been more
people who might have remembered
them, Jurtan ﬁgured, but there would
also have been more excursionists to
lose themselves among. On the other
hand, the smaller towns they’d been
through wouldn’t see ten visitors in a
year, so they’d most likely remember
the two of them if anyone asked.
How much did Max really want to
shake The Hand off their trail?
Something else Jurtan had learned
was how to think and work at the

same time.
While he’d been mulling
Max’s plans and intentions back and
forth he’d succeeded in getting the
area cleaned up and the horses packed;
more skills Jurtan couldn’t recall wish-
ing he possessed.
At least sitting on
a horse all day was no longer a more
drawn-out form of one of Max’s tor-
tures.
Jurtan was almost at a stage
where he could say he felt comfortable
with riding.
“No,” said Max.
Jurtan paused, one foot in its stirrup
and halfway into the saddle. “What?”
“We’ve
been
pushing
the
horses
enough. Let’s give them a break today.”
Jurtan let himself down to the ground.
They hadn’t been pushing the horses,
they’d been virtually coddling them.
What was Max up to? This bit with the
horses wasn’t the only strange thing
this morning, either.
“Why are you

wearing that beard and that grubby
disguise?”
“Practice.
“ If there was anything
else Max didn’t need, it was practice
in deception or dissimulation, which
meant his answer this time had meant
about as much as any of Max’s an-
swers ever did. “If you told me what
was going on I could help,” Jurtan vol-
unteered.
“Oh, you could, could you?”
“What do you have against me, any-
way?” Jurtan mumbled. “I thought ap-
prentices were entitled to some consid-
eration.”
“They probably are. Are you coming
or not?” Max had led the other horse
onto the road.
Jurtan grimaced and
dragged his horse after him.
Something was up, though.
Max
wasn’t usually quite this testy, espe-
cially in the morning; he liked getting

up early, and seemed to hit his stride
right around the time the sun came
out.
Maybe Max did need practice.
Max was always suspicious, but this
morning he was out-and-out on edge.
Something was putting him especially
on his guard.
Max had produced a ﬂoppy, wide-
brimmed hat of a piece with the rest
of his ratty disguise.
It was ratty
only in appearance, though, not in
effectiveness.
If Jurtan met this fel-
low on the street he wouldn’t give
him a second look, except perhaps to
make sure there was enough of a buffer
space around to steer clear of him. As
the trees thickened around them and
the amount of morning light reaching
them through the canopy of leaves de-
clined, Jurtan thought he saw a pale
pink glow begin to peek from beneath
the brim of Max’s headpiece.

Max settled his hat more ﬁrmly.
While his hand was in place next
to the brim, he slid his ﬁngers un-
derneath it and adjusted the control
matrix above his right ear.
Camou-
ﬂage, Max thought, camouﬂage and
subterfuge, always hiding one thing
behind another; what a world.
If we
didn’t have all this magic running
loose, struggles of power and battles of
will, it would probably be a much nicer
place overall. But on the other hand it
probably wouldn’t. People were people
and power, after all, was power. The en-
hancement disc in front of his right eye
ﬁrmed and Max’s overlay-view of the
scene ahead of them settled down. Off
to the left on the trunk of a tree was
a squirrel.
Between its bark-colored
fur and the gloom of the lighting level
it was all but invisible to the unaided
eye, even once Max knew where to

look. To the disc, though, painting the
squirrel’s body heat in a glowing or-
ange, it might as well have been under
a spotlight.
There were other animals out and
about, too - a streak that could have
been a fox, an assortment of birds, a
few more squirrels.
No larger game
was in sight, though, and certainly
nothing on two feet, unless they were
using countermeasures. Screening au-
ral emanations was a standard enough
trick in the right circles, but heat sig-
nature suppression was still largely
unheard of.
Infrared sensors were
such an obvious idea, too. Still, it was
a fact that remote sensing never really
seemed to catch on, like so many facets
of magical technology that were delib-
erately subtle and designed to keep
you out of trouble rather than blowing
up situations with ﬂash and pyrotech-

nics. Most practitioners weren’t nearly
as clever as they thought they were,
and on top of that they’d didn’t much
like to do research.
Of course, Max
thought, there’s research and there’s
research. Everybody liked to steal good
stuff if they could. Their problem was
that they went after it the hardest way,
trying to lift the secrets of a living com-
petitor, or reverse engineering back to
a piece of left-over stagecraft from its
residual fallout. It was safer all around
and usually more productive to boot to
mine where the guardians were dead.
When you wanted certain kinds of
answers, though, going through ruins
and books was nothing but a waste of
time. Max glanced idly around again.
There was someone around here laying
for them, he could feel it. Beyond the
matter of foiling whatever the some-
body had in mind, the larger question

was whether they were just freebooters
out to waylay travelers in general or
whether they had a particular target
in mind.
The options weren’t exclu-
sive, of course, if you were going to
be logically comprehensive, since the
kind of customers who’d ambush some-
one in particular in a forest probably
were the sort who wouldn’t mind an
extra spot of fun and proﬁt if someone
else happened along while they were
waiting.
Until proven otherwise, you had to
assume every plot was directed at you
personally.
Even with this carefully
cultivated paranoia, however, Max had
to acknowledge that the most likely
scenario here was the old scout-them-
out-in-the-village,
rip-them-off-in-the-
forest routine, with the innkeeper in
league with a few of the local toughs.
After all the waiting, when it hap-

pened the whole thing was there and
over with almost as soon as it had
started, in the typical disorganized
ﬂurry and commotion.
Max had unbent enough in his di-
dacticism to warn Jurtan to stay alert
and keep his eyes open. They had en-
tered a section of forest where the path
was both narrower and twistier than it
really needed to be, and also happened
to be snaking through a series of chest-
and then head-high gullies. Reddening
leaves covered the ground. It was, after
all, fall, but it was still early in the sea-
son, and these were a lot more leaves
than they’d seen anywhere else in the
forest.
It could be that this particu-
lar area had had a recent windstorm,
Max was thinking, perhaps coupled
with too little foot trafﬁc to disturb
the leaves since then.
He’d seen the
obvious trace of a wheel-rut in various

places they’d already passed on the
path, but Max knew he wasn’t a good
enough tracker to tell how long ago the
cart had gone through. Still, even with
these plausible natural explanations,
was it possible that someone had de-
liberately spread leaves out across the
path?
Max looked around him at the forest
on either side. Unfortunately, this was
one of the spots where the banks of the
gully were above his head. From the
back of the horse, though, his vantage
point would be signiﬁcantly better. He
raised his hand to tell Jurtan to stop
and stepped up into the stirrup.
Following behind Max, Jurtan had
been hearing an undulating, travel-
ing string motive in a succession of
major keys that he supposed was sym-
bolic of forest murmurs or some such.
For background accompaniment it was

fairly pleasant, as his internal music
ran; it was nicely tonal and more rep-
resentational than conceptual. Jurtan
was much fonder of melody than the
atonal screeching stuff, which tended
toward sour harmonics and sharp sud-
den squeals, but even now, with his
greater level of control, he didn’t usu-
ally have a choice. Over the last few
minutes,
though,
a menacing deep
bass theme had gradually appeared
behind the forest music, which itself
had just modulated to minor. Jurtan
was looking around himself too, try-
ing to ﬁgure out which direction the
menace might be coming from, and so
he didn’t immediately see Max raising
his hand and pausing his horse.
As
a result, when the loud harsh voice
of a steerhorn opened up with a quiv-
ering blast from the edge of the gully
just behind Jurtan’s head, spooking

his horse and Jurtan both, Jurtan had
no idea how close he had drawn to
Max and his horse. In the process of
leaping out of its skin, Jurtan’s horse
only knocked him spinning off to the
right and into the earthen bank, from
whence he went sprawling toward the
leaves, but it hit Max full on just as its
stride lengthened and it really started
to dig in.
Max separated from the stirrup and
hurtled toward the ground just ahead
of the charging horse’s front hooves.
Jurtan,
watching
with
slow-motion
clarity and stunned fascination on
his own trajectory toward the ground,
could see that at the same moment as
Max’s chest hit the path the horse was
going to land on his back with its full
galloping momentum and punch Max’s
spine through his heart. Then, an in-
stant later, Jurtan was equally sure

that Max had pulled off some slick
piece of sorcery and had teleported or
dematerialized himself out of the way,
since he had hit the layer of leaves and
disappeared. An instant after that as
the horse’s forelegs began to disappear
as well and the horse lurched forward
off balance, Jurtan realized that no
magic had to be invoked after all. Just
ahead of them the leaves had concealed
a pit.
Max knew if there were spikes in
the pit he was in trouble. He used the
thump the horse had given his back to
wind himself forward, spinning head-
ﬁrst down. Above him, Jurtan’s horse,
still on solid ground beyond the edge
of the pit, pushed off strongly with its
hind legs, trying to use its momentum
to clear the pit’s far rim, which was
now visible since the net that had held
up the leaves was collapsing under

Max’s weight. Unfortunately, the front
of the horse was already twisting down-
ward after Max. The horse started to
do a forward cartwheel and hit the far
lip of the pit halfway along its forelegs.
Jurtan rolled over once in the leaves
just short of the pit and came to rest
facing upward, giving him a perfect
view of another net with lead weights
woven into its sides descending from
the top of the gully straight toward
him. Also centered in Jurtan’s ﬁeld of
view was the underside of Max’s horse,
which Jurtan had fetched up next to
in his roll. Max’s horse was tossing its
head and stamping its legs nervously,
but it hadn’t decided to take off like
Jurtan’s. Accordingly, instead of drap-
ing itself over Jurtan the thrown net
settled over the horse.
Jurtan rolled back out from under
the dangling corner of the net and

staggered to his feet as the steerhorn
sounded again.
Something swooshed
past his ear - an arrow! Whoever was
up there was going to hang back be-
hind the ridge above and try to pick
them off.
But what if Jurtan just
tried to run away? He heard a crunch,
a clatter, and a loud grunt from his
left, in the direction they’d just come
from, and turned to see a heavily built
man with a wild black beard and a
broadsword getting his balance on the
path; a spill of earth showed where
he had jumped and slid down into the
gully.
Max landed inverted at the bottom
of the pit, in a handstand, his arms
tangled in leaves and netting.
The
horse with its broken legs was sliding
in after him. Max let himself fall care-
fully backward.
Something narrow,
scratchy, and tall pressed up against

his back, yielded, and then snapped
with a crack. There were spikes, but
obviously not enough of them to carpet
the hole.
Max kicked another spike
over out of the way and sprang back-
ward onto his feet, then leaned forward
to press himself against the side of the
pit.
Next to him, the horse ﬁnished
collapsing into the pit, impaling itself
on the spikes.
An arrow thonked su-
perﬂuously into its ﬂesh.
There would be at least four of them,
Jurtan thought. The hefty guy guard-
ing the path with his sword, the archer,
the one with the steerhorn, and prob-
ably another swordsman to watch the
path on the other side of the pit. Max
had been tutoring him in swordwork,
but even after Max’s usual intensive
crash-course Jurtan didn’t think he
could take down all of them with his
blade, especially considering the tac-

tical situation the terrain put them
into. The blade was scarcely the only
weapon at hand, though.
The music in his head left Jurtan
an opening.
Drawing his own sword,
he hurled himself forward at the hefty
man, yelling out “Heda!” in tune with
the music.
A blare of internal trumpets matched
him. The edge of Jurtan’s vision swam,
but with the last month’s practice
behind him his concentration locked
solidly into place and held his con-
sciousness together. Instead, the man
ahead of him reacted slowly, as though
he’d fallen into a sudden daydream, his
eyes vague and sluggish as he began
to adjust his stance and bring up his
sword.
Max and Jurtan had determined
that vocalization wasn’t nearly as ef-
fective in projecting paralysis as the

ﬂute in Jurtan’s pack or the harmon-
ica in his pocket. On the other hand,
his voice was close to hand and left
both arms free.
Jurtan slid past the
man’s guard and whacked him on the
side of the head with the ﬂat of his
blade. Music stabbed at him; without
thinking, Jurtan leapt back. Another
arrow ﬂashed in front of him through
the space he’d just left and punctured
the falling man’s chest.
Max
vaulted
over
the
thrashing
horse before it could crush him against
the wall and rolled upward out of the
pit. Not pausing, he pushed out of the
roll and sprang up the side of the gully.
Just above of him sticking over the
edge an arrow was being slapped into
a bow.
Max snatched at an exposed
root just below the lip, pulled himself
closer, grabbed the bow with his other
hand, then let go of his grip on the root.

As he fell backward he pushed off with
his feet and yanked.
With a crazed
howl a man appeared in the air above
Max, still holding his bow.
The man
twisted over Max and followed his bow
head-ﬁrst into the pit.
Two sets of footsteps crashed above,
retreating rapidly into the trees. Max
was scrambling back up the embank-
ment to give chase when the charging
footsteps stopped and were replaced by
ﬁrst a whinny and then a gallop. The
path beyond the pit jogged to the left;
presumably it snaked around to the
spot where the ambushers had their
horses hidden.
Max dropped to the
ﬂoor of the gully next to his own horse.
“What?” Max demanded of it.
The horse had its head cocked to one
side and was giving him a reproachful
look from beneath its weighted net.
The horse hadn’t moved a foot through-

out the entire affair.
“Be that way,
then,” Max told it.
“Are you all right?” said Jurtan, from
a location safely beyond Max’s reach.
“No thanks to you. Next time take
better care of your horse.”
Jurtan was relieved to note that
Max’s tone of voice was relatively mild,
for Max.
“I don’t think anyone’s go-
ing to be taking too much care of that
particular horse in the future.”
The kid was right.
The horse in
the pit had had one last thrash in it,
and it had expended this by rolling
over onto the bowman.
Most likely
the guy had broken his neck anyway,
but that still left no one to interrogate.
Max picked up his hat, which Jurtan’s
horse had demolished by falling on it,
then tossed it into the pit.
So much
for a ﬁeld test of the infrared detector.
It would have found the ambushers if

he’d had a line of sight to them, but of
course he hadn’t. “It could have been
worse,” Max said.
After all, they did
have the one horse, and the Iskendar-
ian papers. The ambushers might have
tossed down a torch.
Jurtan was standing over the man
on the ground beyond the pit, the one
he’d hit over the head, but who’d then
been shot by the archer when Jurtan
had moved out of the way. “They’re ...
dead,” Jurtan said.
“Yes. Yes,” said Max, “they’re dead,
all three of them.” Max noted that Ju-
rtan was now looking off into the air,
studiously avoiding the sight of the
body lying in front of him in its heap
of leaves splashed red with blood, and
the other man and the horse behind
him in the pit, and in fact Max himself.
Max made no move to approach Jurtan.
If you were going to live with violence

you had to deal with this situation
eventually.
“I, ah, never killed anybody before,”
said Jurtan.
“I mean, I didn’t even
mean to kill him.”
“Well, you didn’t kill him, either. His
friend did.”
“But if I hadn’t hit him the way I did
- if I hadn’t moved away when I did ...”
“Yeah?” said Max after a minute.
“ ... Then either he would have killed
me or the arrow would have,” Jurtan
said heavily.
“Right?
But it still - I
mean, they were people, they had lives,
and all of a sudden -”
“They might even have had mothers,
too,” Max said, “but it’s still worth re-
membering that they were the ones try-
ing to ambush us. You didn’t see them
trying to run away; they took the job,
no one was forcing them.”
Well,
Jurtan thought,
at least I

haven’t thrown up. “I’m just glad my fa-
ther isn’t around,” he muttered. “He’d
probably want to see me drinking their
blood instead of standing around talk-
ing.”
“If we ever see your father again,”
Max said, “I won’t tell him about it if
you don’t want me to.
Keep in mind
that your father is not exactly typical
when it comes to these things.”
Now Jurtan was looking down.
It
wasn’t really that bad, except for all
the blood.
The scene would probably
only give his father an appetite, and
the satisfaction of a job done well. His
father was weird.
But Shaa and Max had been teach-
ing Jurtan to be professional, and there
was nothing weird about that that he
could he think of. What would be a pro-
fessional thing to focus on? “Was this
The Hand again?” asked Jurtan.

“No,” said Max.
“So you don’t know who it was?”
“I didn’t say that, did I?”
“Well, who was it then?”
“I didn’t get much of a look, thanks
to you, but the main guy could have
been Homar Kalifa.”
“Another friend of yours? Is he some-
one else who’s after you?”
Max closed one eye and squinted
up at the sky.
“Kalifa’s a third-rater,
strictly small-scale; more of a tough-
for-hire than a decent adventurer.
A
riffraffy sort, but he does like to carry
a steerhorn. Not too many steerhorns
around these days, either. Now that I
think about it, I seem to recall crossing
him up once, dropped him out a mid-
story window into an ornamental pond,
it might have been.”
“So this could have been just a not-
so-friendly hello for old times’ sake.”

“Maybe,” Max said dubiously. “Even
if the pond did have something nasty
in it; eels, maybe. Doesn’t seem very
likely to be Kalifa, but it’s not totally
implausible.
Kalifa’s the sort who
could easily wash up in a spot like this.
It’s quiet countryside, he could ease
back and terrorize soft locals or dumb
travelers.”
“Really?” said Jurtan.
“You think
this was just random violence?
I
thought you were the most suspicious
person on the continent.”
“There’s no real way to tell, kid. It
could have been a robbery.
Anyway,
you’ve got to remember it’s Knitting
season. A Knitting always kicks things
loose; everybody’s out taking care of
any business they can think of.” Max
glanced into the pit, then looked away
down the path. “Whether or not some-
one sicced Kalifa on us, could be there’s

more of this stuff up ahead.”

Chapter2
IT WAS EARLY MORNING, AND
THESE WERE THE HIGH SEAS.
Actually, the sun had cleared the head-
lands, which meant it couldn’t be all
that early, and since the headlands
above
the
seasonally
fog-shrouded
coast were in easy sight off the star-
board beam the seas couldn’t be all
that high themselves. Zalzyn Shaa had
appropriated his accustomed morning-
watch position on the quarterdeck of

the Not Unreasonable Proﬁt, and, with
his sea legs long since thoroughly en-
trenched, was balancing easily against
the coastal swells with a steaming mug
of herb-brew tea in his grasp. This ﬁne
if slightly foggy morning, Shaa was re-
ﬂecting back on his early acquaintance
with the Not Unreasonable Proﬁt and
its similarly not unreasonable captain
and crew, on the middle reaches of the
River Oolvaan. The River Oolvaan, as
was typical of intra-continental and
land-locked waterways, had a fresh-
water source, even though it emptied
ultimately into the sea.
Its naviga-
tional challenges had been those of
sandbars and shifting currents, punc-
tuated by the odd ﬂood and the oc-
casional cataract.
Didn’t that mean,
Shaa was wondering, that a vessel
which made its habitat on such a river
would have been designed speciﬁcally

for fresh-water navigation in areas of
restricted passage, rather than for the
vicissitudes of the open ocean?
Despite his brief tenure as captain
of this very ship, Shaa did not consider
himself enough of an expert on nau-
tical matters to speak authoritatively.
Such a sage was, however, present.
“Captain Luff,” said Shaa, addressing
the slicker-garbed individual standing
beside him at the rail, where he had
been keeping his usual weather-eye
peeled for any fresh pandemonium
Shaa might feel compelled to unexpect-
edly unleash, “this ship and this crew,
and one might add, yourself, are used
to sailing the River Oolvaan, is that
not true?”
“Aye, Dr. Shaa,” Captain Luff said
warily, “that is indeed the situation.”
“Indeed,” said Shaa.
“Have you
found, then, that the forces at your

command have been equal to the tran-
sition to the salt-water environment
we are now cruising so pleasantly
across?”
Captain Luff removed his pipe from
the corner of his mouth, extracted a
pointed implement from beneath his
slicker, and set to work scraping at the
pipe’s inner recesses. “Why do you ask,
Dr. Shaa? Do you have a criticism to
lodge?”
“Not at all,” Shaa told him, “not
at all.
I was only reﬂecting on the
reservoirs of seamanship and marine
expertise present on this ship, not to
say within its very sinews.”
The captain looked at Shaa for a mo-
ment, his hands still and the pipe for-
gotten. “You know, it is true,” he con-
tinued, after the pause for considera-
tion, resuming work at the same time
on his pipe, “that a mariner does not

often get the chance to engage in con-
versation of the sort I have engaged in
with you, especially while at sea, don’t
you know. That being said, and that be-
ing no less than the truth, it must also
be said that never in all my years of
roaming the waterways of the known
world, aye and seas and oceans beyond
the commonly known, too, never, as I
say, I can state with conﬁdence, have I
heard before today any person refer to
any ship as having sinews.”
“It is my honor to be the ﬁrst, then,”
said Shaa. “But the matter of sinews
remains, nevertheless, with or without
the delineation, as does the matter of
the difﬁculty in realigning ship and
crew from one environment to another.
That would appear to be just the sort
of challenge to appeal to an old sea-dog
such as yourself. Wouldn’t you say so,
Captain?”

“There be more than enough chal-
lenges aboard this ship,” stated Cap-
tain Luff.
Shaa inclined a guileless
eyebrow. By this time, however, Cap-
tain Luff had been through enough
of these encounters to realize that if
Shaa had a guileless bone in his body
it had not yet revealed itself, even by
implication.
“More challenges than
that, Captain?” Shaa said.
“A hardy
sea-dog you must be indeed, and no
doubt about it. Surely there must be
some way I can help lighten the goad
of your burden.”
“I would doubt that very much, Dr.
Shaa,” said the captain with a sidelong
glance in his direction, “seeing as you
yourself contribute mightily to it, don’t
you know. You are a challenge yourself,
sir, and no doubt about that. You must
have been quite a vexation to your
mother, if you don’t mind my saying

so.”
“So she often commented,” said Shaa,
“which was all the more curious consid-
ering the overall balance of terror in
my family.”
Captain
Luff
examined
his
now-
clean pipe with relish before propping
it securely back in the corner of his
mouth. “How was that, now, then?”
Shaa had been lulled by the pleas-
ant swells and the motion of the ship,
which was for a change gentle to a
degree approaching placidity.
“I had
an older brother, you see, compared to
whom I was the merest pussycat.”
“‘Had,’ then, you say.”
“Had, have, it’s all the same any-
way.”
“Is that how it is? I lack the personal
experience, don’t you know, being an
only child.”
“A prudent philosophy,” Shaa told

him, “have no doubt about it.” To the
east, the sun broke through the last
wisps of the morning mist and cast
a clean light across the ship.
Below
them and forward, the main deck was
spotted with clumps of crew members
adjusting ratlines, coiling ropes, swab-
bing the deck, and checking the lash-
ings on the few crates of trade goods
that had failed to ﬁt down in the hold
with the rest of the cargo. Much more
of the deck was open than had been the
case on their run down the Oolvaan.
Perhaps this was also related to the
different demands of sea and river.
Shaa decided that, all things consid-
ered and curiosity aside, it might be
better not to reopen the topic.
Members of the crew were not the
only ones abroad on the deck.
Roni-
bet Karlini and the young Tildamire
Mont were ensconced at their small

writing-desk over by the starboard bul-
wark. Tildamire was not so young as
that, actually, Shaa reminded himself,
noting the appreciative glances the
deckhands were giving her whenever
they had the opportunity.
She and
Roni were both dressed in shirts and
shipboard trousers, with loose jackets
as outer wear, and Tildy had similarly
followed Roni’s lead by cutting her
sandy hair short.
In Shaa’s profes-
sional opinion as a physician an ado-
lescent woman could do much worse
than adopt the sensible Ronibet as her
role model.
Shaa hadn’t known Roni
at Tildamire’s age, though, so it was
possible that could have been a time
when the model had broken down. As
Shaa well knew, even sensible adults
are not necessarily sensible from birth.
Tildamire had been following Roni
in more than just deportment, though.

Roni was easygoing but that was not
the same as being easily impressed.
In discussing their plans for the near
future just the previous evening, in
fact, Roni had commented on Tildy’s
rapidly developing aptitude for sym-
bolic math and theoretical magic. Tildy
didn’t have practical spell-knowledge
or casting skills, but her grasp of their
underpinnings was signiﬁcantly the
harder to achieve.
It could also ulti-
mately take her further if she chose
to continue with wizardry as a career.
Still, the thrill of discovering an astute
disciple did not totally account for the
fervor with which Roni had been alter-
nately encouraging Tildy and egging
her on. Observing Ronibet, the situa-
tion made Shaa wonder if she was not
reenacting one of her own formative ex-
periences. Perhaps Karlini knew, but
if so he had thus far been unwilling to

spill those particular beans.
Not that the Great Karlini had been
all that communicative on any other
topic for the last few days, either. This
morning Karlini was at his accus-
tomed place too, up on the foredeck
wedged into the bow. Karlini had spo-
ken vaguely about keeping a watch
for icebergs, and indeed he had been
spending an inordinate amount of time
gazing off into the water ahead of the
ship. True, Karlini at the best of times
was noticeably absent-minded. At the
moment, though, Shaa had observed
that Karlini had been taking preoccu-
pation to new levels of intensity. This
did not seriously interfere with his
value as a deterrent, and was clearly
playing a role keeping the sailors at
a healthy distance away from his wife
and Tildamire. Sailors were a supersti-
tious lot by tradition, and Shaa would

not have been surprised to discover
that this was codiﬁed in their guild
rules as well, but it took no super-
stition for them to treat Karlini with
vigilant respect, only powers of ob-
servation. They had viewed Karlini’s
pyrotechnics earlier in the voyage.
Of course, as far as the issue of deter-
rence went, there was Svin, too.
As Shaa watched him along the
length of the ship, Karlini suddenly
stood, brushed himself off, shook one
leg clear of the coil of rope that had
decided to tangle itself up with him
on his getting up off the deck, and be-
gan to make his way aft. Some ancient
philosophies had claimed that observer
and object were linked in a complemen-
tary relationship, with an act of obser-
vation causing some reciprocal change
at the other end, and indeed a certain
class of spells were based directly on

this principle, not to mention its ram-
iﬁcations throughout the treatment of
action-reaction coupled pairs. Outside
of the direct application of this phi-
losophy through sorcery, Shaa did not
believe its effects could be felt at the
level of the macroscopic world.
Nev-
ertheless, it was certainly true that
the world was full of surprises. Shaa
had been watching Karlini, and Kar-
lini had taken that moment to spring
into action. Of course, nothing said the
world’s surprises had to be any more
than inconsequential.
Shaa heard a discreet cough at his
elbow. “Excuse me, sir,” said Wroclaw,
Karlini’s retainer. “Might I bring you a
reﬁll for your tea? And you, sir, captain,
a fresh pouch for your pipe?”
Indeed, Captain Luff had just started
to fumble beneath his slicker with
an increasingly furrowed expression,

which Shaa had interpreted to mean
that his tobacco had somehow eluded
his grasp.
As Wroclaw deferentially
extended a full pouch of the captain’s
blend toward him, it became clear that
he had in fact been even better than
his word had implied in anticipating
the needs of the moment. “Thank you,
Mr. Wroclaw,” Captain Luff said, tak-
ing the pouch and beginning to prime
his pipe. “How do you do that, man?”
For Wroclaw, “man” was a generic
honoriﬁc, what with his lime-tinted
skin and extra-jointed arms, but then
you had to allow species terms a cer-
tain laxity in modern society in gen-
eral, unless of course bigotry was your
all-too-common philosophy of life. “I’ve
always looked on it as more a calling
than a job, sir,” said Wroclaw.
“And
you, Dr. Shaa?”
Shaa had thoroughly inspected Wro-

claw as he’d handed over the captain’s
pouch; both of Wroclaw’s hands were
now free and there were no notice-
able bulges around his coat or trousers.
“Yes,” said Shaa, “I will thank you
for your offer and indeed take a re-
ﬁll, since it is after all for medicinal
purposes rather than raw sybaritic
pleasure, but only if you can produce it
now from about your person.”
Wroclaw cleared his throat again
with a genteel “ahem.” Then, when
nothing had happened after a few sec-
onds, he stamped lightly on the top
step of the companionway up which he
had ﬁrst appeared.
“Ahem,” he said
more forcefully, aiming it down the
steep stairs.
An earthenware teapot
appeared at the top of the companion-
way and rose into the air.
“Not beast of burden am, I,” said a
crackly voice.
His attention now fo-

cussed in response to the new speaker,
Shaa could perceive that the teapot
was not in fact ﬂoating on its own
in mid-air.
Instead, the teapot was
clutched in a set of black-cloaked arms
that Shaa had lost at ﬁrst against the
similar gloom of the unlighted below-
decks passage. Beside him, Shaa felt
Captain Luff ﬁnd something else to
observe on the quarterdeck, and edge
carefully away. Captain Luff did have
his limits.
Shaa had his own limits too, of
course, but he made a point of draw-
ing them much more liberally, and
on a time-varying basis of relativity.
“Thank you, Wroclaw,” he said as Wro-
claw poured more brew from the teapot,
“and you too, of course, Haddo. That
was quite neighborly of you, I must
say,” he added judiciously.
“Hmph,” said Haddo.
“Low is fate,

for teapot the porter I to become. If not
on vacation was bird, different would
be things.
Wroclaw, speak with you
would I.”
“Please excuse me, gentlemen,” Wro-
claw said.
“Is there anything else I
might get you?”
“Thank you, Wroclaw, no,” Shaa said.
“Off with you now. The path of wisdom
is not to keep friend Haddo waiting.”
“Indeed, no, sir,” agreed Wroclaw, fol-
lowed by another echoy “hmph” from
beneath his feet. Wroclaw disappeared
down the stairs.
“Quite a crew you are,” commented
Captain Luff from his new position
behind
the
helmsman,
“and
about
that there’s no mistaking.” He ﬁngered
his nattily short growth of new beard.
“Speaking of which, where’s that other
young fellow this morning?
The one
with the cane and his mind in the

haze.”
“The Creeping Sword?” said Shaa.
“I’m sure he’s skulking about some-
where.” He had not actually told a lie,
Shaa reminded himself. He had merely
neglected to mention the fact that the
“somewhere” to which he had alluded
was no longer onboard the boat.
Captain Luff gave a noncommittal
grunt and puffed vigorously on his pipe.
A cloud of aromatic smoke engulfed his
head before shredding away in the
breeze. “And our other amenities are
adequate, I hope? And our navigation?
I trust we are approaching Peridol at
a quick enough rate to suit you, Dr.
Shaa?”
“‘Alacrity’ is a word that comes to
mind,” said Shaa.
This was not nec-
essarily an unmixed blessing. The cir-
cumstances of his last departure from
Peridol had been what they had been,

nor were they likely in the interim to
have changed. Back then, it had been
made clear to Shaa that Peridol was
not what he would be able to call a
healthy place. Nevertheless, one char-
acteristic of interims was that they did
offer an opportunity for situations to
evolve.
His heart gave a sudden pal-
pitation and broke into a run of rapid
beats. Be still, Shaa told it, and took
an extra swig of the glycosidic tea for
good measure. Surprisingly, his heart
did quiet, resuming its regular rate
and rhythm. Pharmacologically speak-
ing, the double swallow of brew he had
just downed would not have yet had an
opportunity to affect things one way
or another, but Shaa was never one to
devalue the role of a timely placebo,
even on himself. For all his crustiness,
Shaa knew well just how vulnerable
he could be to suggestion.

In the classical texts, suggestibility
was tied up with susceptibility to a
curse.
Learning that there was such
a thing as a curse-prone personality
had not improved Shaa’s attitude on
the subject of curses as a whole. Un-
fortunately, one’s conscious attitude,
whether approving or disapproving,
was not a side of the issue that had
any impact on the results; one’s recep-
tivity remained.
So did Shaa’s track
record. To the extent that Shaa’s vul-
nerability to curses might depend on
his suggestibility, Max had tried to
browbeat him out of it, and Shaa had
also submitted to various arcane thera-
pies from the deepest ranges of science
and superstition both, but still the
curse remained. Shaa was resigned to
it. I am, he thought, really I am.
Resignation in this case was as much
a matter of practicality as anything

else. Too many oaths would have to be
broken - and for that matter too many
people would have to die - for the ef-
fects of the curse to end. The thought
always left Max undaunted, but then
Max was an undauntable kind of guy.
Shaa was much less so, at least in this
case. In this particular case, the most
probable single person whose death
would bring the curse to a close was
Zalzyn Shaa, himself.
Down on the deck, the Great Karlini
had reached Roni and Tildamire. He
had been joined partway along his path
from the bow by a seagull, which had
perched itself on his shoulder. This be-
ing the sea, there were many seagulls
about, and a small ﬂock of them had
taken up regular station just astern of
the boat. This particular seagull, how-
ever, had not entered their company
with these others, but had been dog-

ging Karlini’s steps since even before
he’d come to Roosing Oolvaya, having
joined up with them the ﬁrst time at a
spot far inland.
“There’s something not quite right
about
that
thought,”
Karlini
mut-
tered. “‘Dogging your steps’ is a com-
mon enough expression, but doesn’t it
sound kind of odd when applied to a
seagull?”
“Many things you say sound odd,
dear,” his wife told him.
Karlini’s face had furrowed itself
in thought. “Isn’t there some tradition
that looks at the seagull as a harbinger
of doom?”
“Not as far as I know,” said Roni.
“That’s not to say you don’t hear about
seagulls here and there in some of
the
out-of-the-way
texts.
Usually
they’re put in a concrete rather than
metaphysical role,
though;
avatars

of pelagic ecology, that kind of thing.
The seagull?
- maybe a harbinger of
ocean carrion and bivalve mollusks,
but doom? Why aren’t you talking to
Shaa, anyway?
He’s the student of
natural philosophy, not me.”
The seagull stretched out its wing
and ﬂapped Karlini once over the head.
“Urr,” Karlini said.
“It has to mean
something! The thing’s been following
me for months.”
“It probably knows you’re an easy
touch, dear.”
I simply must take up tennis, thought
Tildy Mont. Her father had sent her off
with Roni to get an education and see
the world. The academic stuff she sup-
posed she was getting, all right. What
she’d been seeing of the world, though,
was less scenic than distressing. Tildy
had lost count of the number of conver-
sations she’d witnessed that were just

like being a center-line spectator at a
tennis match, only without the ball,
although sometimes with the rackets.
Tildy was used to it enough by now
that she didn’t swivel her head back
and forth to follow the volleys; she
could observe with her eyes alone, and
even with her eyes closed. The way the
Karlinis played the game was differ-
ent from the way Shaa did it, though,
or for that matter most anyone else
she’d run across.
The things Karlini
said often didn’t seem to have much
connection at all with what was go-
ing on in the rest of the conversation.
Karlini did this with everybody, but
with his wife he was getting to be the
worst.
Was that because they’d been
married for so long, or was Karlini just
heading off on a different plane? Tildy
glanced idly at the seagull, which as
usual was paying no heed to Karlini’s

comments except for an occasional nip
at the closest ear, and sat up straight
with a start.
For a change, the seagull had swiveled
its eye around and seemed to be watch-
ing her.
“No, you don’t,” Tildy hissed. “You’ve
already got a shoulder.” The seagull
squawked and tossed its beak, then
turned and wailed straight into Kar-
lini’s eardrum.
“Yow! Stop that, will you?” Karlini
growled at it. “The ﬁrst thing when we
land in Peridol I’m heading straight to
the college library to look up an exor-
cism for sea-fowl.”
“Sit down and have a piece of cheese,
dear,” Roni suggested. “The grapes are
still fresh, too.”
“I don’t want a grape,” said Karlini,
sitting down anyway and immediately
regretting it. Why was Roni looking at

him like that? “What? What is it?”
“What’s wrong with you, dear? You’ve
been snapping at everyone ever since
we left Oolsmouth.”
“Nothing’s wrong, I’m ﬁne. I’m bored.
I don’t like boats.
It’s nothing.
I’m
ﬁne.”
“So you said.”
Karlini managed a strained-looking
smile. “See? Nothing’s wrong. You like
to see smiles, right?”
“Okay, ﬁne.”
“What did I say? Now you’re mad at
me.”
“You’re just ﬁne?” said Roni. “Okay
then, I’m not mad.”
“Okay then, ﬁne,” said Karlini.
“Fine.”
“Great.”
“...
Uh, guys?” Tildy said, watch-
ing the two of them sit there glaring
at each other, Karlini with his arms

folded belligerently and Roni matching
him with a sour enough expression
to make you think she’d just taken a
swig of milk a week out from under its
freshness spell. “You love each other,
right? Why are you beating up on each
other all of a sudden?” It was sort of
like watching your parents argue. Part
of Tildy wanted to slide under the table
and shrink away. Of course, that was
the part her father, the former Lion of
the Oolvaan Plain, had tried to totally
expunge, along with any other person-
ality features that smacked to the least
extent of anything less than no-holds-
barred straight-ahead attack-dog feroc-
ity. No weaknesses were tolerated in
the Mont family. That was surely why
Tildy’s brother, Jurtan, had had such a
hard time, what with his seizures and
all; the Lion had looked at him like he
was a strange invertebrate dragged in

by the cat and dropped on the rug with
a binding set of adoption papers. Tildy
wondered how Jurtan was doing. Kar-
lini might have been able to snoop in
on him and Max to ﬁnd out what was
up, but Roni was right - Karlini hadn’t
done much of anything since they’d left
Oolsmouth except mope around and be
peckish.
“There’s more to a relationship than
love,” Roni said, after a pause long
enough that Tildy had just about de-
cided neither one of them had heard
a word she’d said. “You decide what’s
important in the relationship and then
you stick to it. Trust. Openness. Shar-
ing. Communication. Old favorites like
that.”
“I’ve got nothing to share!” protested
Karlini.
“So, see,” said Roni. “I guess we’ve
communicated.”

“Good, I guess we have.”
“Right.”
“Fine.”
“It seems to me,” said Tildy, “that
if you, Karlini, were working on some
project instead of -”
“I don’t need marriage counseling
from an adolescent,” Karlini sputtered.
Maybe he’d also been listening after
all.
“Give me a break!
Okay, I’m on
edge, big deal. We’re heading into who
knows what-all kinds of trouble in Peri-
dol, that’s enough to put anybody on
edge.
There’s - oh, why bother.
And
there’s always Haddo.”
“Yes,” said a reedy voice approaching
from astern, “always is Haddo.”
Tildy looked over her shoulder be-
hind her.
There was no doubt from
the voice, of course, that Haddo was
heading their way, but you could al-
ways hope.
Haddo was trailed by a

distressed-looking Wroclaw.
“Thanks, Haddo,” muttered Karlini.
“Perfect.” Karlini didn’t enjoy knocking
heads with his wife, especially with
Tildy tossed in the mix to boot, so
that should make the idea of being
rescued more appealing, he thought,
right? Unfortunately, rescue by Haddo
promised its own set of new aggra-
vations.
Haddo’s industrious scuttle
ground to a halt next to the table.
Ready or not, Haddo was upon him.
“Time for more contract negotiations,
Haddo?” Karlini said.
Haddo aimed the black opening in
his dark hood at Karlini, the twin ﬂoat-
ing red sparks in its depths canted
reprovingly and the cloth of the upper
rim drooping over them like accusingly
furrowed eyebrows. “Master, O Great,”
said Haddo.
“Homage give we small
laborers. Master are you, light can you

treat serious the matters.”
“I guess that means yes,” said Kar-
lini, his scowl (if that was possible)
deepening further. He pushed himself
to his feet. “I guess I’d better deal with
it.”
“Guess?” said Haddo.
“Guess not.
Only do.”
“What?” Karlini muttered.
“What,
you want me to start paying you for
those pearls of wisdom now too?”
Roni watched Karlini move reluc-
tantly
off
with
his
retainers,
and
Tildamire watched Roni.
She hadn’t
seen Roni like this before. Roni sighed.
Actually, Tildy thought, remembering
that all of them kept telling her pre-
cision was important, it was more a
masculine exclamation of “huh!” than
a feminine sigh. To say it was a sigh
would put the wrong spin on it.
“I
don’t know, Tildy,” Roni was saying,

oblivious to Tildy’s internal battle with
vocabulary.
“You spend years with
somebody, you start to think you know
them, then you blink at them one day
and see they’ve turned into someone
else.”
“Uh, maybe it’s like he said, he’s just
worried,” Tildy suggested. “He thinks
he’s got to watch out for me, keep the
sailors off me. I wish he’d back off a
little.
I mean, there’s my father and
everything.
My father thinks I can
take care of myself or he wouldn’t have
let me go off with you.” She noticed
Roni wasn’t listening again.
Just as
well; Tildy thought she might have
gone overboard a little with the bit
about her father.
As far as the Lion
was concerned, the only one who could
take care of themselves was the Lion.
“Karlini said he doesn’t like boats.”
Roni was playing with a grape from

the bowl on the table. “He doesn’t like
boats, but he’s never reacted like this
before.
He usually just turns green
and sits in a locker moaning.
I’m
not a shrew.
It’s him - he’s keeping
something from me. He was always a
terrible liar.”
“Okay, maybe he is. Why would he
do that? If he is, he sure doesn’t seem
very happy about it either.”
“Well, whatever it is, I’ll tell you
this.
I’m going to ﬁnd out.” Grape
juice squirted. Roni wiped the crushed
grape skin off her ﬁngers.
Tildy found she was staring at the re-
mains of the grape. Don’t go making a
metaphor out of this, she told herself.
The image of the pulped fruit stayed
with her, though. If this kept up some-
how Tildy didn’t think grapes were the
only things that might get crushed.
The Great Karlini stopped on the far

side of the deck, leaned on the rail so
he could look over the side, and said in
a low voice, “Is this far enough out of
anybody’s earshot for you?”
Haddo regarded him, his arms be-
neath his cloak planted solidly on
what in any similarly proportioned
humanoid would have been his hips.
“Bum are turning yourself into, you.”
“What Haddo means to say -” Wro-
claw began.
“What means Haddo to say,” snapped
Haddo, “Haddo will say.
Not for you
is business this, you with for liver the
lilies. When tough must get - are doing
you what?”
“Would you like to sleep with the
ﬁshes?” asked Wroclaw, in the same
urbanely unrufﬂed tone he always
used.
The other incongruity in the
scene, aside from his words, was con-
tributed by the way in which Haddo

was now dangling over the side of the
boat above the rushing water below,
suspended by the bunched material
of his hood caught up in Wroclaw’s
clenched hand.
“Answer now, if you
would, Haddo my colleague.”
From the strangled sound of Haddo’s
voice, Karlini thought, you might think
Wroclaw had him by the neck instead
of by the hood. “Down put me!” he gar-
gled. “Point have you made!”
Karlini blinked. Haddo was back on
the deck. There’d been a slight black-
tinged blur in the air, but that was
the only sign that Wroclaw had swung
him back rather than using some kind
of quick-zap teleport number.
Haddo
shook out his cloak and reached up to
adjust the hang of his hood.
“Regret
will you this,” he muttered.
Rather
than a manifesto of vendetta and doom,
though, the remark sounded to Karlini

like a statement made pro forma, for
the sake of appearance and conversa-
tional nicety.
But Wroclaw? “Uh, have you been
taking some kind of martial arts lessons
or something, Wroclaw?” Karlini said
tentatively.
“As always, sir, my services are yours
to command,” said Wroclaw. “As Haddo
was commenting,
though,
with his
usual velvety manner, we have been
noting a certain ... decline in your con-
dition of mind of late, sir. We beg your
pardon for our boldness in raising this,
but there it is.”
“Condition of mind?
What are you
talking about?”
“A term that comes to hand, sir, is
‘mope;’ also ‘brood’ or ‘sulk.’ We would
all much rather see you engaged in
some productive activity than slipping
into, excuse me sir, as I mentioned

before, decline.”
There it was. A sorcerer in “decline”
was one who’d lost his or her touch and
was an accident waiting to happen; raw
meat for the next predator who walked
up with half an appetite, a sinking ship
to be deserted. The seagull shifted its
balance uneasily on Karlini’s shoulder.
“Is that what this is about?” said Kar-
lini.
“Are you telling me you’re quit-
ting?”
“No, sir,” Wroclaw stated, “certainly
not at just this moment. Peridol in this
season is likely to be rather a challenge,
though, if I might say so.”
“I’ll be ready! Don’t worry about me,
I’ll be ready.”
Wroclaw scrutinized him.
“Indeed,
sir, of that I had no doubt. Please par-
don our impertinence. Haddo, shall we
go?”
“I’ve got something else to discuss

with Haddo,” said Karlini. “Leave him
with me.”
“As you say, sir.” Wroclaw bowed and
withdrew.
Karlini directed a hard stare at
Haddo, which the seagull still perched
next to his head duplicated.
Haddo
stared back. “Well?” Karlini said. “Is
that what you wanted to talk about?”
“Close enough is matter. Better can
you do than doing have been you.”
Karlini closed his eyes, and kneaded
his forehead.
“All this plotting and•
scheming, scheming and plotting.
It
never ends, Haddo, it only gets worse.”
“Word gave you.”
“I know I gave my word, Haddo, but
this is not going to work.
I haven’t
kept anything from Roni since I met
her. Now I’m supposed to work against
her behind her back?”
“Not as extreme as statement is situ-

ation. Know this you.”
Karlini turned back to the ocean
and drooped over the rail. The seagull
squawked and hopped off his shoulder,
ﬂapped once, and came to a neat land-
ing next to him on the gunwales.
“I
can’t do this, Haddo. It’s only going to
get worse, it’s not going to get better.”
Karlini felt Haddo’s leathery hand
on his back.
“Do it you can,” Haddo
told him, “because do it you must. In
Peridol perhaps will be all things re-
solved.”
“You don’t really believe that.”
Haddo shrugged. “Happen it could.
Happened have stranger things.”
“That’s not very reassuring.”
“How things go, that is.
Help you
perhaps can I. On this think I should.”
Karlini had fallen silent. Haddo watched
him a moment longer, though, before
deciding Karlini was in no signiﬁcant

danger of falling or leaping over the
rail. As he retreated, Haddo cast an-
other glance back to be on the safe side.
Karlini was still drooping, his back to
Haddo, but the seagull ﬁxed him with
an intent, watchful look.
Checking periodically over his shoul-
der, Haddo made his way below decks
and into the hold.
The crates and
lashed bales of their cargo had been
packed tightly into the available space,
with only a few narrow passageways
left to twist and dodge their way be-
tween them.
Haddo, however, was a
being of less than average size.
He
had also assisted in the packing. This
was not the ﬁrst time during the trip
he had been down in the hold, either.
He was sure no one had been following
him, and no one was in sight when he
scuttled around a bend in one of the
passageways, dropped to the deck, and

slid himself to the left.
Anyone car-
rying a lamp through the hold would
have seen no hint of an opening, since
the sacks that ﬂanked the passage at
that point bulged out at the front, cast-
ing a maze of shadows on everything
below them. To detect the narrow re-
cess at the bottom where a cleverly
raised palette kept the sacks off the
deck an observer would have had to
crawl, hope for a quiet bilge as they
put their eye down on the deck, and
aim their light just right.
Of course, it was a ship, so there
were rats. As Haddo wriggled through
the narrow space, pushing the sack
he’d picked up on his way past the
kitchen in front of him, something chit-
tered at him from up ahead deeper in
the blackness.
Haddo growled back
at it. The squeaking persisted, joined
by a blinking set of green eyes.
Ob-

viously this was a rodent he had not
previously encountered. “Warned you
did I,” muttered Haddo.
A red glow
spread from under his hood, then fo-
cussed down and became twin beams,
straight, clear, and narrow with a color
like spotlit rubies. The rat’s green eyes
ﬂuoresced and its chittering turned to
a squeal as its sharp-edged shadow
spread out behind it. Where the beams
converged, a puff of smoke rose out of
its fur. Then the rat had had enough.
It twisted away with a ﬁnal wail and
was gone. The beams and the red glow
died.
Haddo edged through the area
the rat had abandoned and reached
the lower edge of a crate. He rapped on
it. “Who is it?” said a mufﬂed voice.
“Who think you it is?” Haddo snapped
“You can’t be too careful,” grumbled
the voice. The wood panel clicked and
slid upward, and Haddo edged through

the opening.
The panel glided shut
behind him. “Hold on while I get the
lights.” A ripple of shining green ran
around the wall over Haddo’s head and
snaked off at right angles, outlining
the inside of the crate.
Then yellow
burst out through the green, the two
colors pulsated once or twice as they
worked things out between them, and
the light level settled down to a con-
stant low but serviceable glow.
The crate measured perhaps eight
feet on a side. As you’d expect from a
crate in a cargo hold, the space ahead
of Haddo was crammed tight with stuff
- rolled parcels concealed in oilskins,
boxes with latches, a lashed set of
short metal rods, a hand-axe. Barely
visible atop the mounds of equipment
was the curve of a spherical cauldron.
Behind Haddo, a ladder was fas-
tened to the inside surface of the crate.

The same lattice-work retaining wall
that kept the contents of the crate from
collapsing into the entrance-space con-
tinued upward along the ladder’s path.
Haddo grasped the ladder and scurried
up. At the top of the ladder a two-foot-
high gap separated the cargo and the
crate’s upper lid. Protruding from the
center of the cargo was the upper swell
of the round ball, and swung back from
the center of the ball was a domed lid.
“Outside met I rat,” Haddo told the
creature perched inside the sphere, its
head propped on the lip.
“You want to tell me about inconve-
nience?” said the creature, its pointed
ears splayed at conﬂicting angles. “Try
taking an ocean voyage inside a box.”
He moved his head around in a slow
circle,
carefully stretching his neck
muscles, then worked one shoulder
back and forth to match. “I’m getting

to be nothing but a mess of hog-tied
ligaments.”
Haddo tossed the sack he’d lugged
up the ladder onto a cluster of skyrock-
ets protruding out of the baggage next
to the ball. He gestured at the metal
sphere.
“Have you not your vehicle,
Favored? Life support facilities has it,
said you not?”
“There’s a big difference between
support and comfort,” said Favored-of-
the-Gods.
“At least you get to walk
outside on the deck.”
“A pleasure always that is not,”
Haddo said drily.
“Also my idea this
plan was not.”
“You could have tried to talk me out
of it.”
“Frozen permanently in frown is
mouth,” asked Haddo, “or is just to
make of visitor with supplies to wel-
come feel?”

“If you weren’t bigger than me I’d
whomp you one,” Favored muttered.
“Testy is getting on ship everyone,”
Haddo reﬂected.
“At throats people
are.”
“Is that supposed to make me feel
better?”
Haddo shrugged. “Not alone are you.
Good or bad not is, fact is only. Of it
make what choose you. To Peridol ride
wanted you.”
“Well, yeah, all right,” said Favored.
“You’d think if my patron wanted me in
Peridol for the Knitting she’d at least
have supplied transportation, but no.”
“Insensitive
ones
work
you
for,”
commiserated Haddo.
“Downtrodden
masses are we.”
“You
starting
with
the
dialectic
again?” Haddo shrugged.
“Anyway,”
Favored went on, “as long as you’re
bringing up insensitivity, how’s that

Karlini of yours doing? You keeping an
eye on him?”
“Faith has kept Karlini.
Speak to
wife will he not.”
Favored shook his head.
“I don’t
know about him, Haddo. He could be a
weak link. If he lets something slip to
her - or, worse, directly to Max - Max’ll
come after us the ﬁrst thing he does.
I don’t mind telling you I’d rather not
face him head-on.”
“Danger is Max. Getting around it
no way is. To check put on Max, options
limited are. Karlini most attractive op-
tion is.”
“You’re sure he’s not going to fall
apart?”
“Sure am I not,” snapped Haddo.
“Said I not under strain is he not. Ob-
serving closely am him I. Difﬁcult posi-
tion have put we in him.”
“So we’re just going to watch while

his fuse burns down?”
“Credit give me for brains,” Haddo
said.
“When Peridol reach we, mood
of Karlini must we lift. Cycle must we
break.
This for, place Peridol perfect
is.” Haddo hesitated. “Problem only is
Karlini not. Told I not you about ice
the attack.”
One of Favored’s eyes snapped wide
open and the other squinted half-shut,
his nictitating membranes twitching.
“Did you say ‘ice’?”
“Ice said I,” said Haddo reluctantly.
“On trip down river to Oolsmouth at-
tacked by icebergs was boat. Thought
Karlini and Shaa against them was
aimed strike this.”
“Does that mean what I think?”
“Know not I, suspect I only.” Favored
slumped back into his sphere.
His
voice echoed out with a hollow metallic
tone.
“That’s the last thing we need

right now.”
“Last need we, ﬁrst yet but may we
have.”
“Ice,
you say?” Favored repeated,
with a note of disbelief.
“That’s not
good. What the hell business does he
have heading out of the frozen wastes
to come after you down here, anyway?
I thought he was out of the picture for
good. You said he couldn’t survive out
of that climate, either.”
“Maybe someone he got refrigerator
to build.”
“Damn,” said Favored,
now thor-
oughly morose. “You got anything else
you want to tell me? What about that
seagull?”
“Bird speaks not yet.”
Favored hung his head back over the
lip of the hatch. “I don’t like that ei-
ther. The idea of that bird makes me
nervous. As long as that thing’s walk-

ing around . . . Well, I don’t like it.”
“Much around is there that like you
not,” said Haddo. “Agree with you do
I, yet strike we preemptively can not.
To be on guard, to wait, to watch is of
wisdom the strategy.”
“Wisdom?
You trying to turn your-
self into a sage now too?”
“Particularly wise am I not.
Open
merely are eyes.”
“Yeah, well, you’re probably right,”
Favored said. “You’ve had more ﬁeld-
work than me anyway. There sure isn’t
much we could do on a boat even if we
wanted to. Once we get to Peridol the
story’ll be different.”
“In Peridol will be many things dif-
ferent,” Haddo said. “Enjoy you of re-
ﬁll the fruit.” Always a useful ally, was
Favored, Haddo mused as he squirmed
his way back out of the crate and into
the passageway in the cargo hold. See-

ing adequately as always in the min-
imal light, he padded quietly toward
the exit, dodging around the jogs and
corners.
Two to the left, then one to
the right, then - whoompf!
“Where from came wall?” muttered
Haddo, taking a step back.
There
hadn’t been a surface at this spot on
his way in. Then all at once he realized
that what he’d run into wasn’t a wall at
all. It was a man. A large man, in fact
a very large man. A man whose mass
owed nothing to sloth or fat and every-
thing to cord upon band of muscle, that
and
his
hereditary
ceiling-scraping
stature.
“You,” whispered the man.
“Down
keep
your
voice,”
hissed
Haddo, feeling the cargo shift around
him in resonant vibration with the
subterranean rumble of the speech, “or
avalanche cause could you.
Around

boat seen you have I. Svin are you.
Dark corners liking are you now?”
“You,” Svin repeated, with a bit less
rumble this time, but with the same
hollow bang and boom.
“I have seen
you too.
You have been avoiding me.
You are Haddo.”
“Avoiding have I been not,” protested
Haddo. “No reason would have I -”
“I have tracked the snow leopard.
For three days have I followed him
through the tundra, through the empty
plains.
When someone tries to hide
from me, I know.
You are Haddo.
I
know you.”
“Serve we both same masters,” Haddo
said, his own voice a bit scratchier than
usual. “Met did we in service together,
recently, on boat.”
“No,” said Svin. “I know you. I am
a barbarian from the frozen north, like
my parents before me.”

Haddo stared him up and down.
Even in the gloom of the hold, lit only
by the stray beams of sunlight that
had wormed their way through gaps
between the planks of the deck above,
it was apparent that this statement
was out of date. “Barbarian were you,”
Haddo stated. “Now wear you trousers
and shirt, cut you your hair; aban-
doned have you loincloth, are gone
your furs.
Civilization have you en-
tered.”
“You may be right,” Svin said reﬂec-
tively. “Perhaps now I am something
else. That is not the point. You will
not change the subject, you with your
games of language and your culture of
deceit. Men are not born to -”
“If to something say have you,” said
Haddo, “stop you can I not, but favor do
me this - forget at least of noble savage
the spiel. Old has it become.”

“Words are a trap,” Svin acknowl-
edged. “I leave the snares of rhetoric;
the truth is this. At the top of the world
my people lived with the land; with the
caribou, the ice hawk, the polar bear.
We lived the way of the warrior. Man
strove against beast, family against
nature, tribe against tribe. Who would
dare rule us?
Chill wastes were our
home. Even the hand of the gods was
light.
Then came Dortonn, Dortonn
the sorcerer, Dortonn and his Kingdom
of Ice.” Svin spat, as though to clear
his throat of something vile.
What was vile to Svin was not
merely the content of his speech, Haddo
knew. Not that long ago Svin had been
down with tuberculosis. Since then it
had been hack and hack, cough and
cough all over the ship.
Svin got his
throat back under control and contin-
ued. “With his power Dortonn forced

my people to serve him, to build his
castle. We called to our gods, but they
were with Dortonn. They told us to sub-
mit. We would not submit, even at the
word of our god. But we were not the
only ones under Dortonn’s hand. There
were others in the wastes. Those like
you.”
“Many relatives have I -”
Svin squatted down in a smooth
powerful motion and closed one hand
over Haddo’s cloak next to the hood,
where his shoulder probably was. “One
among them served Dortonn as his
chamberlain, as Fist of Dortonn.
He
too was a cunning sorcerer.
He was
called Haddo.”
“Among my people common of Haddo
is name,” Haddo said quickly.
Svin’s
hand
tightened.
“Under
Haddo, Fist of Dortonn, life was hard,
but before this time Dortonn himself

was even worse. There was little differ-
ence; we hated both Dortonn and his
Fist. Then one day there was lightning
and ﬁre in the castle. One tower fell.
We fought Dortonn’s soldiers shoulder
to shoulder with Haddo’s people, who
seemed to come from the very walls.
Some said this was Haddo’s doing, his
plan to overcome Dortonn.
“Many fell. Many ﬂed. Dortonn sur-
vived, though his strength was now
weak. Haddo was not seen again.”
“Interesting
perhaps
this
is,”
al-
lowed Haddo. “Happened what then?
Events these must years ago have
been.”
“Yes,” Svin said, his voice lost in
memory, “years ago. I was a child. Yet
it was I who saw Dortonn escape into
the cliffs.”
“Do not understand I why to rule
frozen wastes would want someone,”

said Haddo. “Of better places are there
plenty.”
“That is what I need to ask you.
Why?
Why did Dortonn come to us?
What was the true story, and the story
of Haddo?”
“Release you your hand,” Haddo in-
structed him.
To his surprise, Svin
realized that his ﬁngers had obeyed al-
most before his mind had had a chance
to process the demand.
Still, rather
than grab Haddo again he stood up and
moved back a step. In Haddo’s voice,
croaky though it was, Svin had sud-
denly heard the same tone of nonsense-
is-over that he’d been trained to recog-
nize across from him at the other end of
a sword. The twin red embers beneath
Haddo’s cloak looked hotter than usual,
almost like the actual pit-of-hell ﬂames
Svin remembered from bedtime tales
as a youngster, and seemed to circulate

like whirlpools of ﬁre as Haddo stared
up at him and spoke. “If that Haddo
were I, if there had I been, think would
I that behind this story, really was
there a god, that his tool Dortonn was.
For gods games these are.”
“That is not enough.
I must know
more.”
“Your time bide you,” Haddo said
after a moment. “If that Haddo were I,
lightly not would take I this.
Much
means this to you...
Against this
Haddo swore you vengeance?”
“Of course I swore vengeance,” said
Svin, taking another step back.
“My
people are always swearing vengeance
for one thing or another.” The elders
had told him to watch out for ma-
gicians, especially ones who weren’t
human, but they’d never really ex-
plained how to rationalize the crafti-
ness you needed around sorcery with

the forthrightness expected from a
warrior born. “But now I am older,” he
went on, more thoughtfully, “and have
seen too much for things to be that
simple. Perhaps knowledge may be a
kind of vengeance too.”
A sudden creaking at the far end of
the cargo hold, and a new glow in the
air, indicated that someone else was
undogging the door across from them
and coming in. “Perhaps talk will we
again,” hissed Haddo.
“One question
pose will I for you. Name know you of
god, master of Dortonn?”
“They said Dortonn’s allegiance was
only to Death,” said Svin.
“That’s
all my people ever thought of him as,
Death.”
“Many deaths there are. To tell them
apart, names they have.”
“... I was only a child,” Svin said ten-
tatively, “but perhaps I did hear some-

thing else, at night, when the elders
were talking. Is it even a name? Pod
Dall?”
“Is a name,” Haddo reassured him.
It was quite an interesting one, espe-
cially under the circumstances.
The
god whose creatures had terrorized
Svin’s people had kept an uncharacter-
istically low proﬁle; this god had appar-
ently not wanted his identity bandied
idly about.
Still, Svin’s information
corroborated Haddo’s own suspicions.
Quite interesting. Especially under
the circumstances.
Did Svin know
about the ring they had picked up in
Roosing Oolvaya?
Probably not.
It
would be just as well not to tell him. In
particular, it might be better, at least
for the moment, that Svin not know
about the god trapped in the ring. The
god by the name of Pod Dall.

Chapter3
THERE HAD TO BE LAND AROUND
HERE SOMEWHERE. I dug the oars
in again, stroked against the swells
for at least the ten-thousandth time
since I’d left the ship, and felt the
dinghy move another fathom further
toward what I hoped was still the east.
The water-hugging mist had enough
of a pearly glow that I knew the big
moon was up there someplace, even
if by now it was surely declining to-

ward dawn. The fog bank had gotten
thicker as I rowed, though, and it was
now useless to think about putting
the moon squarely astern and rowing
away from it, since I couldn’t see the
disc of the moon to save my life. Hope-
fully it wouldn’t come to that.
After
all, I did have a compass. I was conﬁ-
dent enough of my ability to row in a
straight line that I couldn’t have been
checking it more than once a minute.
But how hard could a continent be to
ﬁnd when you were sitting just off-
shore?
As creative as I’d been at getting my-
self into trouble, I might ﬁnd out.
I looked out at the haze and stroked.
Maybe one reason the fog was so thick
was that some of the murk that had
been clouding my own mind was ﬁ-
nally leaking out.
Wishful thinking,
maybe, but you could argue that was

the same philosophy that had already
carried me alive and intact over more
than a few rapids in the last several
weeks. Wishful thinking and luck.
Riding the rapids does take a toll,
though. The end of the mess in Oolsmou
had left me in a daze; how much so was
only becoming clear to me now that I
was coming out of it. In my stupor, ﬂow-
ing along with the current, I’d taken
some actions that didn’t seem entirely
well-chosen now in retrospect. Drifting
out to the Oolsmouth docks and link-
ing up with Shaa and the Karlinis for
the ride to Peridol was one of them.
It had seemed to make sense at the
time.
I’d felt like I needed reinforce-
ments around, enough to provide me
with a breather to rethink and regroup.
I also hadn’t been looking forward to
walking or hanging onto a horse all
the way from Oolsmouth to Peridol.

On the other hand, for anybody who
might be watching me, I’d now rein-
forced my connection with the others
and in effect dragged them even deeper
into my own problems. I know, I know,
“anybody who might be watching me”
sounds paranoid to the extreme. Para-
noid I may have been, but there was
still the evidence of recent twists and
turns to show that in the case paranoia
was the most conservative of strate-
gies; I was as sure of that as, well, as
my own name. Of course, considering
that I didn’t have the slightest idea of
what my name actually was, that gives
a pretty good outline of the state of
affairs.
They’d been calling me the Creeping
Sword. An alias like that is enough to
send anyone with a modicum of taste
back to bed with an icebag, I know, but
unfortunately it was really my own

fault.
There’d been that case I’d just
ﬁnished involving this Sword guy, see,
and the name was so cheesy it stuck in
the front of my mind. When I fell in
with Max and Shaa and they wanted
some handle to address me by it was
the ﬁrst thing I could think of.
Like
most ﬁrst thoughts, it left endless pos-
sibilities for recrimination after the
fact.
It beat “hey you over there in
the corner,” I guess, but both of them
had about the same relationship to
anything approaching the real me. At
least, I hoped they did. None of us re-
ally knew, which was yet another way
of popping the situation into a nutshell.
Of course, a patronymic like the Creep-
ing Sword was certainly the least of
my worries.
Just because I had problems, though,
didn’t mean they were all equally dif-
ﬁcult to address.
Even if joining the

Not Unreasonable Proﬁt had been a
bad idea it still might not have been
too late to escape the repercussions,
which is why I found myself out alone
in a rowboat in the middle of the night
in the middle of the ocean. From my
vantage point at the moment, this was
not the ﬁrst time one of my solutions
looked less appealing than the problem
it was supposed to solve. Nevertheless,
if I could make it to shore it shouldn’t
be more than a three- or four-day walk
into Peridol along the coast road. That
sounded like a good investment.
A
stout hike was probably the perfect
prescription for draining the last dregs
of goo from my mind.
That’s what
Shaa had said, anyway, and prescrip-
tions were his business.
There wasn’t much question about
the hike’s destination, either; Peridol
was clearly the place to be heading.

Whatever your question might be, Peri-
dol was always the leading place to
ﬁnd answers.
Of course, Peridol be-
ing what it was there were usually
more answers than questions, and if
you hadn’t thought to bring a question
with you, Peridol was more than happy
to provide you with more than enough
of its own.
That was Peridol during
normal times. During the Knitting sea-
son, that should apply at least double;
maybe even triple, who knew?
Since
Peridol was Peridol, someone probably
had the multiplier posted somewhere,
with a back room full of probabilists
arguing over the odds.
There it was again, math.
Things
kept coming back to math.
For me,
math had always been a dark room
and me without a match. I didn’t think
I had any better grasp of mathematics
now than I’d had before I’d run afoul

of Max and his crew.
Well, ﬁne, I’d
never wanted to be an accountant, and
I’d certainly never wanted anything to
do with the other major discipline that
required a solid grasp of math, both
abstract and applied. It was an axiom
that you couldn’t do magic unless you
could work the math, but that had
always been just dandy with me.
Just look at me now, though. Whether
I’d had anything deliberate to do with
it or not, at the very least you had to
admit a lot of magic had been work-
ing itself around me lately; not only
around me but through me. “Through
me” just about describes it, too.
I
wasn’t real happy about it; I didn’t like
being the next thing to a conduit or a
trade road, sitting there minding my
own business while magic stampeded
over my head like a herd of runaway
buffalo, but then I wasn’t real fond

of magic in any guise.
On the other
hand, I wasn’t entirely complaining
either - there had been a couple of
situations where I’d have been in a ter-
minally tight spot if I hadn’t succeeded
in sucking something useful out of
Gashanatantra through our metabolic
link. At least that’s what I’d assumed
was happening. Now I wasn’t so sure.
There was a lot I wasn’t sure about,
and even more about which I abso-
lutely knew I understood too little.
Even something as simple as the cast
of players, whether they were there
by deliberate intention or had just
been swept up by the swelling broom
of events, was far from clear.
There
was Gashanatantra, who had had an
important hand in getting this thing
started in the ﬁrst place. He’d hauled
me in to be his front man back in
Roosing Oolvaya, using the hook and

gaff rig that bound his metabolism
to mine.
One of the worst things to
do if you want to live to an advanced
age is to surprise a god, but I’d sur-
prised him, all right, when it turned
out the metabolic link was more than
a one-way street. Drawing fragments
of his knowledge as well as his power
through the link had helped me out
in the short term,
had helped me
enough to save my life more than once.
Whether the long-term situation was
any more than the same fated death
stretched out for the sake of excrucia-
tion remained to be seen. What didn’t
seem open to question was the extent
to which the events just past had fo-
cussed Gash’s attention on me. At best
I was a tool he’d found unexpectedly
useful; at worst I might have actually
become a center of his serious interest.
As Shaa and Max had told me and

I’d come to see for myself in Oolsmouth,
Gash’s reputation for plots with more
layers than a ripe onion was honestly
earned. The mess in Roosing Oolvaya
had been downright intimate by com-
parison.
There, Gash had only sent
me up against Oskin Yahlei, the necro-
mancer and would-be god who’d taken
charge of the ring holding the trapped
Death, Pod Dall. The ring had swept
Karlini into the situation, too, and
with him Max, but if Gash cared about
them or even knew they were there I
hadn’t seen a sign. Of course, it now
appeared that, whatever he had said
at the time, Gash’s main interest then
had been with the ring; after all, he’d
been the one who’d trapped Pod Dall in
it in the ﬁrst place.
Throughout
the
Roosing
Oolvaya
and Oolsmouth side of things, though,
Gash hadn’t seemed to necessarily

want the ring in his own possession.
Instead, it was lurking out there serv-
ing the same purpose as a ﬁshing lure
or a piece of ﬂypaper or a nice ripe
tarpit - to work as a catalyst and a
decoy, both, pulling folks out of the
woodwork and getting them enmeshed
in a situation that appeared to be one
thing on its face, but that in fact in-
volved Gash behind the scenes pulling
strings toward his own inscrutable
goals.
Every time I thought about it
his hand only looked more subtle. He
wasn’t one for brute force; instead, the
core of his style as I’d seen it rested
in giving players the opportunity to
do things their inclination naturally
disposed them toward anyway.
Once
the framework was in place, all Gash
had to do was point them toward the
right target and stand back while they
took off after it like a hound after a

plumped-up rabbit.
Of course, this kind of stuff was eas-
ier to talk about than to pull off. No
matter how much you wanted to hide
behind the screen, sometimes someone
just had to be out on stage helping
things along.
The problem with that
was that once you were out in public,
you made yourself a target for people
to come after later if and when they
thought they’d ﬁgured out what had re-
ally been going on. In Oolsmouth there
had indeed been such a front-line ﬁg-
ure; Gashanatantra, right? Of course
not.
No, they thought it was me.
Actually, if it had only been that,
it would have been simple, or sim-
pler, anyway.
The players Gash was
working with were ones he knew. They
knew him, too, but more than that they
were already out for his hide. Rather

than dodging indeﬁnitely he’d decided
to face them, in a manner of speaking.
Because of the metabolic link and the
aura it projected, they thought I was
him.
I was more than a front man,
I was a full-ﬂedged surrogate.
I was
there not only to advance Gash’s plot
but to take his heat.
Of course, no one actually bothered
to tell me this or ﬁll me in on my role;
no, I’d had to ﬁgure it out as I muddled
along. At least Gash hadn’t decided to
rearrange my face, or my anatomy in
general. Fortunately for me, in his cir-
cles no one seemed to raise much of an
eyebrow over a new body here or there.
Still, the ﬁrst person who’d showed up
believing I was him was his wife. At
least Jill hated him; that I could deal
with.
I could sympathize with it too,
since I wasn’t exactly fond of him my-
self, but given the circumstances sym-

pathy didn’t seem like the most produc-
tive approach to take.
If Jill had succeeded in killing me
straight off I didn’t think Gash would
have been too unhappy either.
After
all, if Gash was supposed to be dead it
would have given him even more free-
dom of action, as well as relief from
Jill and anyone else on his trail. That
I hadn’t obligingly caved in had only
opened the door to an extended high-
wire act. In the company of Jill and her
partner, Zhardann (or Jardin), the Ad-
ministrator of Curses, I had somehow
succeeded in extending the masquer-
ade for days; in fact, they might not
realize it was over yet.
I was sure
that the way we’d parted company,
though, had left them more than eager
to renew our acquaintance at the next
possible opportunity. The least they’d
be looking for would be answers I ei-

ther didn’t have, or couldn’t give them
and expect to remain alive.
Would they be in Peridol?
Hah!
-
that was a sucker bet. For a Knitting
everyone who thought they were some-
one would be in Peridol.
That didn’t
mean I had to make things any easier
for them than they already were.
If
they’d picked up my trail in Oolsmouth
they could have learned I’d shipped out
on a boat. With all the sea trafﬁc con-
verging on Peridol it’d been impossible
to tell if the ship was being shadowed,
but it wouldn’t have been surprising.
Even if we weren’t under observation,
it was only elementary to ﬁgure that
showing up in Peridol on foot rather
than on water might keep them off
balance. Of course, knowing my trav-
eling companions, a welcoming party
might be waiting for any or all of the
Not Unreasonable Proﬁt’s passengers.

That being said, any reception waiting
for me would probably be the nastiest;
these were gods I’d been fooling around
with, after all.
Even if someone was
merely waiting for the boat to come in
to pick up our trail I didn’t want to give
them that much of a break.
Unfortunately, that wasn’t the only
possibility to consider. They could be
waiting for me to split off from the oth-
ers before coming after me. They could
-
But there was only so far you could
go in trying to anticipate how someone
would surprise you next. The more re-
active you became, the more initiative
you threw out. I was pretty damn tired
of being tossed back and forth by the
whims of fate, chance, and the plots of
others.
I wasn’t planning to wait for
another god to show up on my doorstep
and sling me into another maze of their

own devising. It was time to assert my-
self, to become again an active partici-
pant in my own story rather than just
getting bounced around the landscape
by the events unfolding around me.
That didn’t mean I wasn’t perpetu-
ally looking over my shoulder, waiting
for the next hand to reach out from
the unknown and grab me around the
neck. Just because I’d come to an ideo-
logical breakpoint didn’t mean I’d lost
all sense of reason.
I was still half-
expecting someone to pop out of the
water next to the boat and hoist them-
selves onto the gunwales.
You could
say a rowboat in the middle of a fog
bank had to be one of the safer places
to hide out. On the other hand, these
were gods etcetera etcetera; you go over
the same ground often enough and it
gets less and less interesting, unless
you have a particular appreciation for

churned mud.
Mud or no,
the situation hadn’t
changed.
Who knew what the gods
could do?
More to the point, I sure
didn’t know what they were capable
of, other than lots of nasty surprises.
They had to have limitations, but other
than the ones I’d observed, which cen-
tered primarily on a shortage of good
sense, and on energy supplies and the
recurring need to refuel, I didn’t yet
know what they were.
It didn’t go
nearly far enough toward evening the
scales to remember that my sparring
partners apparently thought I was a
god too. Aside from its dubious value
as a deterrent that didn’t help me a
whole lot. More than outweighing the
deterrent value on the downside was
the fact that it seemed to keep the
scheming lot of them interested in me.
The thing that bothered me more

than having them think I was a god
was the chance they might be right.
Even though I’d been listening for
it, it suddenly occurred to me that the
sound I’d been waiting for had grad-
ually snuck up unawares. More than
the constant swish and gurgle of the
swells, there was now the added crash
and whoosh that implied the presence
of breakers and a shore.
It was be-
hind me, too, exactly where I’d been
hoping for it. There’s that old proverb,
about watching out what you wish for
because you might get it, but in this
case I couldn’t see how it was going
to bite me, unless the shoreline was
actually one of jagged rocks and I was
about to have the keel ripped off the
rowboat. In the larger case the proverb
was a different story. Even so, I didn’t
see how that story would pick up again
until I’d made it to Peridol, though, or

at least before I’d gotten through the
waves onto the beach.
Everything was in place, not that
I’d brought much with me off the boat.
A pack of supplies sat underneath my
seat, and jammed through the top of
the pack lengthwise was a stout walk-
ing stick just the right heft and length
for a two-hand broadsword. I left off
rowing for a moment and felt around
for it to make sure it hadn’t wandered
off - yeah, there it was, all right. “You
got anything to contribute?” I asked
the stick.
It didn’t say anything, which was
no more than I’d expected, but it did
vibrate quickly under my hand, send-
ing a low tingle up my wrist and into
my arm. Was that a message with real
content, or was Monoch just letting me
know it was still alive, or whatever
it really was? I couldn’t say. I didn’t

know its language, if it had a language,
but I had come to know its moods. At
the moment it was placid enough, for
a change. I didn’t know its purpose, ei-
ther, beyond the fact that it was at best
a reluctant ally foisted on me by Gash.
That meant that it had to be a spy, and
quite possibly a homing beacon too.
Unfortunately, things being what they
were I just couldn’t toss Monoch in the
sea and be done with it, if tossing it in
the sea would let me be done with it,
which was another question entirely.
The sound of breakers behind me
was now distinct. After perusing a nav-
igational chart, Shaa had assured me
that given the currents and the topog-
raphy of the coastline I’d be encounter-
ing beach rather than rocks. I didn’t
exactly trust Shaa’s seamanship, but
he’d assured me he knew this section
of the countryside well, and anyway I

didn’t have much choice.
A predawn
seagull cawed somewhere overhead.
Off to the left I saw white-capped foam,
then the rowboat creaked and lifted.
I played with the oars, trying to keep
the dinghy headed straight-on, and as
the wave dropped beneath me the keel
grated on sand.
I splashed and sloshed my way up
the beach, dragging the rowboat by
the painter in the bow, as the breakers
rose to my knees and ebbed away.
I
was going to take this as a clearly good
omen. It was anticlimactic, true, but I
was hoping to ﬁnd more anticlimactic
episodes in my life in the days ahead.
I left the rowboat overturned on the
beach under a bed of tangled kelp and
headed inland up the sand.
I sort of
wished I could take the boat along; I
never liked to waste a good piece of
equipment, and who knew what I’d

need for those same days ahead, but
on the other hand clawing my way up
a cliff and then hiking for days along
a road carrying a rowboat on my back
or hauling it behind me could easily
attract just the kind of attention it was
my intention to avoid. There was also
the condition of my back and other as-
sorted joints and muscles to consider.
It was the sort of stunt you sometimes
hear about in myths, and certainly had
the mythical characteristic of being es-
sentially pointless, but maybe that was
just the kind of thing gods appreciated.
Probably not the ones I’d met, though;
they seemed to like to avoid anything
that smacked of direct work.
I could have camped at the edge of
the water until the day arrived or the
fog lifted, but I didn’t want to push my
luck; I had images of somebody send-
ing giant lobsters out of the surf to

snap pieces off my hands while I dozed.
So I moved up the beach in the fog, the
sparse light giving me a ten-foot circle
of visibility before the mass of the fog
won out over the glow of the moon,
stumbling over piles of driftwood and
popping the ﬂotation bladders of ten-
drils of slimy kelp, until I discovered
the cliff by the simple expedient of
walking into it. That was good enough
for me. No way was I going to try to
climb an unknown cliff in the dark and
the fog when there wasn’t even any
need for it. I ﬂopped down on the sand,
rested my head on the pack, and closed
my eyes.
If there was any particular subject
one or another of the members of Max’s
crew weren’t interested in I hadn’t dis-
covered it yet. One of the topics they
all had something to say about was
dreams. In my case, afﬂicted as I was

by the effects of the Spell of Nameless-
ness, they thought my dreams should
be a fertile area of study; mirror of
the unconscious and all that. I hadn’t
been much help. Max had a technique
for monitoring the surface thoughts
of someone he could physically lay his
hands on, but it hadn’t picked up a
thing from me. “If he’s got a mind in
there at all I can’t ﬁnd it,” was Max’s
only comment on the question.
Actu-
ally, that was okay with me. I’d been
starting to have doubts about how far
I could trust Max, especially if my orig-
inal identity turned out to be someone
he didn’t like.
What if I really had
been a god? If the Spell of Nameless-
ness was a weapon mainly employed by
gods against each other, as Zhardann’s
use of it had seemed to imply, that was
a possibility that couldn’t be ignored,
not that I felt like a god, whatever a

god was supposed to feel like. If I was
or had been a god, though, regardless
of what I felt like, the trick to survival
might very well involve keeping out of
Max’s sight.
Karlini with his hypnosis and Shaa
with his bedside manner hadn’t had
any better luck in prying hidden vi-
sions out of me either, though. As Shaa
had pointed out, it was true that none
of them had ever examined a victim of
the Spell of Namelessness before, and
such cases were also under-reported
in the literature, so as far as any of
them knew loss of dream content could
be a standard effect. I had a slightly
different slant on it. As far as I was
concerned, dreams were even more of
a myth than me and the rowboat, since
I didn’t think I’d ever had one in my
life.
Well, that wasn’t entirely true. Not

the part about the dreams, that was ac-
curate enough, but the slight exaggera-
tion about my life. The fact was, I knew
very little about my life.
The Curse
of Namelessness had taken more than
my name, it had erased all memory of
whoever I might have been and what-
ever I might have done prior to my ar-
rival in Roosing Oolvaya. Physical ev-
idence was lacking, too - I didn’t even
have an evocative scar.
Which made it all the more unex-
pected, as I dozed off there on the
sand next to the cliff, to discover I was
having, in fact, a dream.
Not that it was much to talk about,
I suppose.
There was a landscape of
mist.
I knew it wasn’t a real land-
scape, though; it didn’t feel real, it felt
too real, as though it was the mother
lode ideal against which all mists in
the real world were just cast shadows.

It crackled with clarity, it sparkled,
it shone, as though I was examining
each wisp simultaneously with a mi-
croscope. By comparison, the genuine
mist I’d just been rowing and slogging
through was a cheap cast-off imitation
let loose by someone who didn’t have a
clue how a real mist was supposed to
be put together. But all it was, for all
its hyper-realism, was fog. Great, I re-
member thinking, all this time waiting
for a dream and what I get is fog?
The fog and I contemplated each
other.
Maybe it was my metaphor
about the conditions inside my head
made concrete.
It did hold my atten-
tion, in a way actual fog never had, but
even so it wasn’t exactly an epiphany
of meaning. Then I saw the face.
It had actually been condensing for
awhile without my growing aware of it.
When I did realize something else was

there, it was already a rough head-and-
shoulders bust, still the grayish-white
of the mist surrounding it and with-
out any discernible features, as though
someone had cast a wizard spotlight
on their sculpture garden after a sea-
son of extreme erosion. Even in that
state it projected the same realer-than-
real effect as the mist itself, but as
it formed a thin nose and a straight-
edged mustache, a close-shaved cap of
silver-blond hair, and eyes of glacier-
ice blue, I had the feeling that if I ever
met this person (since I’d never seen
him before in, well, my life) I would rec-
ognize him instantly, even if all I could
glimpse was the tip of an ear around a
door in the dark. The image looked too
intense to be a person; if I didn’t know
better, I’d have said someone that vivid
must be something superhuman, like
a god. I ﬁgured it must be an artifact

of this dream business - the gods I’d
encountered hadn’t seemed any more
radiant than anyone else you’d meet
on the street.
The face hung there for a bit, and af-
ter a vague interval I had the feeling
I could put a name to it. No voice pro-
nounced it, and I didn’t hear the name,
per se, it just sort of seeped into the
back of my awareness. For some rea-
son I couldn’t actually pronounce it my-
self, either; instead it had sneakily by-
passed the usual paths of speech and
memory to plop down, latent, on the tip
of my tongue.
How long the experience lasted or ex-
actly when it ended I had no idea, but
the next thing I knew I was staring
down a length of rock and earth. Up a
length, really, since I was lying on my
back and the cliff was still stretching
up over my head, although now into

the retreating fog under the brighter
glow of dawn. I got to my feet and set
about putting myself together.
In reconnoitering the base of the
cliff, I came across the one artifact
I’d been most hoping for right at the
moment - a trail. Shaa’s map had indi-
cated villages scattered here and there
along this stretch of coast, and a small
ﬁshing port slightly to the south, so it
wasn’t like we were talking about unex-
plored wilderness; a prepared path up
the cliff hadn’t seemed unreasonable.
The path had its share of switchbacks
and crumbly spots, but the patches of
wildﬂowers clinging to cracks in the
rock and spills of earth made the short
hike surprisingly scenic. The fog had
retreated enough so that the top of the
cliff began to condense into view when
I was barely halfway up.
Emerging
over the lip at the end of the climb

brought me out of the fog entirely and
onto a meadow of wild grasses waving
gently in the morning light.
Behind
me, the cliff submerged into the fog as
though it was the edge of the coastline
and the sea was the gray of clouds, and
the beach I’d crossed was off in another
world beneath the waters.
I adjusted the pack and pushed off
toward the road. It was further back
from the cliff than I’d expected, but I
still came upon it soon enough.
The
road was wide enough for a lane-and-
a-half of trafﬁc, but it was paved with
stone; this deep in the heartland of
empire you wouldn’t expect anything
less. Still, it wasn’t being maintained
as well as it might, especially with the
Knitting coming up and all. The sta-
tus of maintenance was driven home
even further when I topped the ridge
of a low hill and saw a canted-over

barouche at the trough at the foot of
the hill ahead of me.
Two men were
standing next to the carriage looking
down at the right-front wheel.
As I
drew up to them it was plain to see
what had happened. One of the paving
stones had shifted and the wheel had
wedged itself into the resulting gap.
Fortunately for them the wheel hadn’t
splintered and the axle was intact, but
the carriage was plainly stuck tight.
Both men were covered with road dust
and breathing hard. Scattered around
them on the road were several boxes, a
large luncheon hamper, and a trunk.
The man in livery, his hands on
his hips, called to me, “Give us a hand
here, then, will you?” The driver wasn’t
the one of interest to me, though. The
other man, his black and silver trav-
eling clothes now distinctly the worse
for wear, had ﬁxed me with his full at-

tention and, I thought, a ﬂeeting touch
of surprise. “Well met,” he said, “and
timely. You’re the ﬁrst person along in
the last hour.”
“And a pleasant morning it is too,” I
said, indicating the roadside wildﬂow-
ers glistening in the sun.
“Wouldn’t
you say?”
“It now shows signs of improve-
ment,” agreed the man. “You’re a stout
fellow; the three of us should have no
trouble accomplishing what the two of
us could not.”
Even if they’d been straining at the
carriage and unloading its contents for
the last hour, which looked perfectly
plausible given their appearance, the
guy still had a sword slung on his hip.
He hadn’t reached for it to put it on
as I’d approached, either; he’d been
working with his sword easily at hand.
It wasn’t only that sign that made me

recognize him as a pro. I’d seen that
aura of latent menace before, along
with its subliminal aroma of congealed
gore. He’d be a nasty one to cross. I
didn’t want to cross him; I didn’t even
want to get within his range. I’ve sized
up enough swordsmen to know which
ones are deadly and which ones only
think they are.
But that wasn’t the real reason I was
reluctant to approach. He –
“You’ve recently been to sea,” he
stated.
“Actually, I spent the night down on
the beach.
Unfortunately I picked a
part of beach that was a little close
to the tide.” I wasn’t about to volun-
teer to anyone that I’d gotten drenched
while landing a boat, especially not
him. I didn’t trust the situation; it was
a classic setup for all kinds of things.
Of course, it could have also been an

honest case of a random busted wheel,
but there was more to my feeling than
just the setup.
It wasn’t merely the
situation, and it wasn’t just the look
of him with his sword. Was it just my
paranoia acting up again? Was I just
going to automatically distrust anyone
I happened to meet? No, because - “I
beg your pardon?”
“Together we will extract this wheel
and then you will ride with me; I in-
sist.”
“If it’s just the same to you, I’d just as
soon walk. It’s a nice day for a stroll.”
“No, no, I won’t hear of it,” said the
man. His hand seemed to drift, of its
own accord, toward the pommel of his
sword. “I insist. What is your name,
so I may know in whose debt I ﬁnd my-
self?”
“Okay,” I said slowly, “if that’s the
way it’s going to be, that’s the way

it’s going to be.
My name’s Spilkas,
and before you start in after my life’s
history I’d just as soon tell you I’m
a fellow of no particular account.” I’d
resolved not to be caught short reach-
ing for a moniker like the Creeping
Sword again.
I ﬁgured I was due a
few free throwaway names to toss out
at random, anyway, but I didn’t mind
borrowing some from people I’d known.
Spilkas was a jittery cutpurse back in
Roosing Oolvaya. He was so ﬁdgety, in
fact, that he couldn’t do a job unless he
was halfway soused.
Spilkas existed
along a ﬁne line - too drunk and his
coordination would go and he’d start
to fall down, not pickled enough and
he’d twitch himself straight into jail. I
wasn’t one for getting sloshed myself,
but the connection with his ﬁne-line
lifestyle still made the name a sure ﬁt
for me. “Who might you be?”

“I am Joatal Ballista,” he told me.
But he wasn’t.
He was lying.
I’d
have known he was lying even if it
hadn’t been for the dream, but the
dream put the capper on it.
The
dream where I’d seen his face; had
it scoured into my memory as though
it was etched on the business end of
a branding iron.
And the name that
went with it, the one that had perched
itself on the tip of my tongue, was ...
was ... Redley? Fredley? No, Fradgee.
No, not that. Fradi. Fradjikan, that
was it.

Chapter4
HIS BUSINESS DOWN THE COAST
had gone tolerably well. There was al-
ways far too much to be done given
the time and resources available. Still,
things were coming together. With his
new insights into the motivations of
his patron he was coming to be more
prepared for the aftermath, and with
his recent recruitments and alliances
the short term was looking bright as
well.
The outcome had always been

fairly much ordained, of course; he had
been commissioned to deal with Max,
and there was no doubt Max would
indeed be dealt with quite compre-
hensively.
It was how one managed
the loose ends and overall esthetics,
though, that set the brute practitioner
apart from the select virtuosi at the
top of the form, or at least that was
the ideal Fradjikan always preferred
to pursue. Rather than the sudden de-
scent of calamity from the skies, Fradi
was partial to the gradually tightening
web of encroaching doom, the progres-
sive dropping away of escape routes
and camouﬂage both, until the noose
was ﬁnally drawn tight in an orgastic
passage of revelation and inescapable
ruin. It made one feel glad to be alive.
Nevertheless, being master of the
web didn’t mean that one foresaw or
planned out every last detail. Planning

was only part of the game, anyway. If
you were a commander of troops per-
haps the greatest satisfaction might
come from watching your plan reel
itself out with every particular pre-
cise, the forces of each side marching
as automata through their prescribed
evolutions; an ideal rarely achieved,
to be sure.
Those who plotted plots,
on the other hand, whether as their
livelihood or just from innate dispo-
sition, were either ﬂexible or found
themselves cracked across the fault
line of their greatest rigidity.
That
was the source of the real challenge
- proceeding toward a ﬁxed end-point
through an ever-changing ﬂurry of ran-
dom events and the workings of fate.
The real challenge and, to be honest,
the real fun. But what was the harm in
that?
The most effective practitioner
was the one at one with his job.

In Fradi’s experience, though, fate
rarely got its workings into gear this
early in the morning. Yet here was this
Spilkas fellow, producing himself right
into Fradi’s lap, as it were, of all things.
Spilkas was now sweating as much as
Lowell, the driver, or Fradjikan him-
self, but as Fradi had predicted the
sweat had been both timely and ef-
fective.
Lowell and Spilkas ﬁnished
manhandling the last unloaded piece
of baggage, the big trunk, back into
the cab and stood back for a moment to
pant.
“Have you breakfasted?” Fradi
asked Spilkas. “The inn provided a jug
of freshly squeezed orange juice.”
“Orange juice, you say?” said the
man, retrieving his pack from the side
of the road. “A swig of that wouldn’t be
a bad idea.”
“After you,” said Fradi. He opened
the door to the coach. “Don’t hesitate

now, come come. I won’t hear of it.”
“Did you make a promise to some
god you’d meet a good-deed quota?”
Spilkas said, “or is this just some
compulsion to hobnob with the lower
class?”
Spilkas had been deliberately trying
to be irritating, and was succeeding
rather well for that matter.
“I also
have some cheese and a modest assort-
ment of fruit,” Fradi told him. “Look at
it as payment for services if you like.”
Spilkas grunted but at least gave off ar-
guing, and let Fradi follow him into the
carriage.
Lowell mounted to the box
and got them underway.
Fradi doled
out the refreshments and considered
the situation.
Spilkas; a dispensable name, to be
sure.
Surely the name was as false
as the one Fradi had used himself.
(Which one had he used? - oh, Ballista,

of course.)
Names were quick cam-
ouﬂage on the cheap but nonetheless
effective for all of that.
At least the
fellow wasn’t using one of those horrid
tacked-on appellations, wasn’t calling
himself Someone the Something, for
instance.
During a stint as facilita-
tor to some court or another early in
his career,
a higher-level factotum,
the principal chamberlain in fact, had
taken to referring to Fradi himself as
Fradjikan the Assassin, as opposed
to Fradjikan, the assassin, which was
how he had been hired.
Well, Frad-
jikan had squared accounts with him,
and ultimately with the entire court.
Not out of spite, or anyway not spite
against the court; it had been a pure
question of business.
His real em-
ployer in that case had been the court’s
subsequent inhabitant.
In such ways are reputations built.

Yet what was the background of this
Spilkas, now at work with determina-
tion at demolishing a hearty wheel of
Brie? Until he had appeared boarding
the ship following the denouement in
Oolsmouth Fradjikan had not detected
his presence.
Perhaps he’d merely
taken passage with the others; it was
too soon to tell. If Spilkas didn’t look
any more impressive at close-up than
he’d seemed from afar, he did have
some potential in his own right. In par-
ticular, he was proving very adept at
giving no information of any substance.
On the other hand, he affected a cane
even though he had no obvious impair-
ment, and vanity was something that
could be played upon.
“You must be on a lengthy excursion
to need such a stout walking stick,”
Fradi tried.
“Not much to look at, is it?
If it

wasn’t an heirloom I’d chuck it in
a marsh.” Well, so much for vanity.
“What does bring you out on the road,
then, and camping out on beaches?”
“Maybe you’ve heard there’s going
to be a Knitting down the road here a
piece? You got any more of those wheat
crackers in there?”
Fradi passed over the hamper.
It
was likely this fellow would be nothing
but a waste of time; most people were.
Considered as a limbering-up exercise,
however, even going through the mo-
tions wouldn’t be entirely a waste, and
anyway all he’d be doing otherwise
would be sitting with his own thoughts
looking out the window of the carriage.
On the other hand, perhaps Spilkas
really represented something key, but
something that needed a bit of digging
to exhume.
Fradi wouldn’t discard
him until the possibilities had been

exhausted; Fradi was not one to frown
back when luck smiled. “Had you been
long at sea?”
“What sea?” said Spilkas, his mouth
full of cracker.
“I said I was on the
beach, not on the water, didn’t I?”
“Perhaps you did.” There was no way
Spilkas could know he’d been observed
getting on the boat, and as a result
no way for him to know that Fradi
recognized his position as a lie.
Not
that Spilkas had actually come right
out and stated that he hadn’t been on
a boat.
The difference between mis-
direction and outright mendacity was
primarily a semantic one, though, or at
most question of tactics. That wasn’t
the issue.
If Spilkas was at pains
to make a casual acquaintance think
he hadn’t been at sea there was obvi-
ously something there he deliberately
wanted to conceal.
His association

with the others seemed most likely.
Was the plan for Spilkas to act as their
deep-cover agent in Peridol, clear of
surveillance and free to carry out any
secret schemes?
Could there be even more here?
Could they be trying to set him up?
Fradjikan, himself?
Fradi decided that that brief consid-
eration was about all that possibility
deserved. Yes, it was a possibility, but
no, the chance was too low for reason-
ability.
How could they plan against
him; they didn’t even know he was
there.
Surely he had not tipped his
hand to reveal, even by implication,
his presence on the scene.
The sun
could ﬂare and the oceans could boil,
too, but the cost/beneﬁt ratio in plan-
ning for the eventuality was similarly
too stacked to make it worth worrying
about. There was only so much looking

over one’s shoulder one could engage in
before one’s neck became irretrievably
frozen in a retrospective attitude.
Nevertheless, it was useful to re-
mind oneself occasionally that one was
not a sorcerer. One might employ them,
and one might know how to bend them
to his purposes, and one might even
have a professional but limited respect
for them as lower-order tradesmen and
functionaries, but one still had to ad-
mit they did have their own annoying
tricks and their own peculiar delusions
of grandeur. Indeed, though, delusions
notwithstanding, there was no reason
to get one’s own hands dirty grubbing
around in the mystic arts. Why stoop
so low when there were magic practi-
tioners for hire begging on the streets,
almost, when one’s own patron was a
god of not inconsiderable power, even
among gods, and when one’s allies in-

cluded such as even a high contender
for the throne of Gadzura? And when
one was who one was oneself?
Why, indeed?
“Why do you keep harping on this
sea stuff?” Spilkas said suddenly. “You
looking to recruit a sailor?”
“I, ah, I was just on my way back up
the coast,” Fradi began, his thoughts
racing barely ahead of his words, “after
a quick trip down to the cape to seek
news of a ship overdue for its arrival in
Peridol.”
“What ship’s that?”
“The Flying Pelican, out of Oolsmouth
“Who thinks up these names?” mut-
tered Spilkas. “Any boat with a name
redundant as that deserves whatever
it gets, if you don’t mind my saying so.”
“I suppose you’re right.” Actually,
Fradjikan had just made up the name
himself out of whole cloth; not one of

his ﬁnest moments, it was true, espe-
cially given his earlier thoughts on the
adequacy of acceptable names or the
lack thereof. “I don’t suppose you saw
anything sailing past, while you were
camped out there on your beach?”
“No pelicans, that’s for sure.”
“Perhaps some sailor colleagues of
yours?”
“I know coincidence is golden and all
that, but don’t tell me you were expect-
ing to get the news you’re looking for
from a guy you picked up at random
on the road. Come on, Ballista. Here’s
one for you that’s a lot more reasonable
- you know any decent places to stay in
Peridol that still have room?”
“No, I’m afraid I don’t,” said Fradi.
He had a few bottles of assorted spir-
its packed away in the bottom of the
hamper, including a fresh one of aged
rum; was it time to crack one of them?

Maybe if he could get Spilkas drunk it
would make him more helpful, either
by making him talk more or making
him talk less. If worse came to worse,
Fradi could drink enough himself so
he wouldn’t care.
No, that would be
unprofessional.
It was still too early
in the morning, anyway.
“I do know
that lodging is scarce; you may ﬁnd
yourself back on the road home as soon
as you’ve arrived.” Fradjikan leveled
a ﬁnger at Spilkas.
“You should also
know my personal staff complement
is full, so don’t think about taking
service with me to stay off the streets.
Unless you have some particular talent
I should know about?”
“I don’t know. What kinds of talent
would you like to know about?”
“Anything you’re proud of.
Or we
could converse for awhile and see if
something comes to light.”

A sardonic smile crossed quickly
along Spilkas’ face and was just as
quickly gone. “Go ahead and try. Talk’s
cheap. It’s still a waste of time.”
Hmm, thought Fradi.
Was there
something there? “I’m certain you un-
dervalue yourself. Everyone has some
skill.
No one is entirely a blank, a
complete unknown.”
The sardonic grin ﬂickered back.
“Oh, yeah?”
“Any person with -” Fradi stopped
himself, or more precisely the words
faded away on their path from his
brain to his mouth as his mind lost
interest in them.
Something much
more interesting than words had just
occurred to him. The more unknown
Spilkas was the better.
Fradi could
soon change that anyway.
In fact he
could -
The plan seemed to spring together

out of its disjointed parts like an ex-
ploding clock viewed in reverse, cogs
and gears and springs spinning out of
the air in a jumbled cloud of glinting
streaks, forming into a greater order
as the cloud condensed, and then ﬁt-
ting themselves together one against
the other in a chorus of clicks and
snaps. It was all Fradi could do to keep
from rubbing his hands together in a
paroxysm of satisfaction and beaming
a triumphant smile at the man oppo-
site him munching crackers, his guest,
his patsy, the gear around whose hub
his plan would turn. Oh, Fradi was in
the groove now. And Max -
Just wait until he got to Max. He’d
make him a - well, just wait.

Chapter5
THE THING HAD DEFEATED ALL
HER EFFORTS. Admittedly,
Leen
hadn’t directed the full force of the
Empire against the ancient door and
the window with the tantalizing lights;
in fact, the only talents to be ranged
against it thus far had been her own.
Her skills were not meager but neither
were they ﬁrst-rank, or she might very
well have been occupying a position
other than Archivist.
Things being

what they were, with the impending
Knitting and its inevitable accompany-
ing realignments of the various coali-
tions and interest groups, palace ca-
bals and pecking orders, she’d thought
it best not to become an open-ﬁeld
loose ball in someone’s power game by
attracting attention to a forgotten mys-
tery. To be honest with herself, Leen
had to admit that the thought of a
horde of specialists descending on her
library had been a strong argument
in favor of keeping knowledge of the
whole affair secret; restricted, in fact,
to herself.
As far as the records showed, the
Archives themselves had never fallen
under direct military administration
or the control of any organization of
secret police. Leen had no intention of
becoming the Archivist who’d let that
happen, either.
She took her oaths

seriously, and the heritage she’d been
handed down. One of the main tenets
of that heritage was that Archivists
were independent,
owing their pri-
mary allegiance not to the Emperor
(except as required for the needs of
protocol and good sense) but to the
Archives they served and to the ide-
als of the past they recalled, whatever
those really were.
In practice, that
meant that Archivists did their best to
do what they damn well pleased, which
- considering that they hung around in
basements all day reading old books
and pushing dust from this surface
to that - didn’t generally amount to
much one way or another. To be bru-
tally frank, the Archives were a largely
forgotten backwater, overlooked in the
midst of the Empire’s sprawling man-
agement structure. When all was said
and done, though, that was just ﬁne.

There are worse places to be than the
basement, and many worse things to
do than read, especially when you’re
interrupted only for the odd bit of put-
tering.
The problem was, the strange room
seemed impervious not only to direct
force,
both physical and sorcerous,
but to analysis as well. Its seals and
shields were so strong it might as well
have been off in another dimension en-
tirely, rather than underneath Leen’s
own cellar, for all the good her probing
had done.
The thing just downright
ignored her; it was as aloof to Leen’s
efforts as she generally tried to be to
the world at large. Actually, Leen ad-
mitted, the thing was better at its act
than she was at hers. She could learn
that much from it, at least. An outside
observer with a contrary streak and
a captious perspective might pose the

thesis that you’d gone a long stroll
indeed down the road to dottiness
when you sunk to the level of using
ancient artifacts as role models.
For-
tunately
this
hypothetical
observer
wasn’t around, though, and in any case
Leen wouldn’t have listened to her if
she had been. The commentary of her
own hyperactive superego was more
difﬁcult to evade, but all that really
meant was that she wasn’t working
as hard at ignoring it as she needed
to. A talkative superego was probably
another warning sign of encroaching
dotage anyway. Senility was not some-
thing that ran in Leen’s family, but it
never hurt to be watchful.
She sat back on the bottom rung of
the circular staircase in the hidden
room and stared ahead at the polished
metal wall.
From a purely esthetic
standpoint the place did look nicer

with the grime of ages gone, the metal
gleaming in the lamplight, the crys-
tal in the adjacent wall sparkling, the
air no longer prone to send her into
sneezing ﬁts at the slightest swirl of
a dust-raising motion.
Still, all this
cleanliness was clearly a sign of defeat.
To have gone unsuccessfully through
the interesting options only to arrive
at housework was not encouraging, ei-
ther from the standpoint of solving the
mystery or from that of the inherent
statement of housework itself.
Not
encouraging, but there it was.
The thing didn’t seem to be anti-
magical, per se, it just seemed to stick
its nose in the air and disregard it.
Leen couldn’t detect any active shield-
ing, but the fact remained that as far
as any probe she’d been able to look
up was concerned the space behind the
wall was no different than any nonde-

script hunk of solid rock. Actually, the
rock would have been more interest-
ing; a probe into rock would at least
give you some mineralogical or metal-
lurgical data back. Transverse defects,
grain size, and veins of tin weren’t
Leen’s particular gratiﬁcation point,
but data return - even if the data them-
selves were boring - was good enough
for calibration, and for reassuring you
you were doing more than just pouring
energy down a hole. Except in this case
she couldn’t even detect that there was
a hole. Action-at-a-distance work had
proved similarly useless, and as far as
her efforts with a pry-bar, well, she
might as well have stayed in bed.
It
was time to hit the stacks again.
Leen trudged up the stairs and out
through the secret door in the bookcase.
Even if the sole source of illumination
hadn’t been her lantern, and she could

have seen all the way to the ends of
the Archives in every direction, Leen
was convinced that some of the rows of
cabinets and bookshelves would have
stretched out to a vanishing point like
the margins of a road on an endless
plain.
That is, if the rows of shelves
had actually been straight, and the
aisles hadn’t been heaped with their
own mounds and crates of stuff. One
Archivist had done little in her seven-
teen year tenure but try to map the
ﬂoor plan.
The Goldhound brothers
had done a bit better in their survey,
but unfortunately they’d been more
interested in artifacts than textual
material; artworks and treasures and
whatnot.
Of course, the Goldhounds had had
the question of their personal survival
to take into account.
They’d had the
unhappy fate of serving during the

reign of Abysinnia the Moot, in the
earliest days of the Empire. The reign
of the Moot had almost ended the days
of empire once and for all, too, what
with his goal of never appearing in
court or public without wearing an
assortment of treasure that weighed
more than he did, and never the same
pieces twice.
From the histories and
the portraits, he hadn’t exactly had an
asthenic body build, either. Still, Leen
did have the Goldhound directory and
Carla’s map, and the half-dozen other
catalogues and indexes that had come
down to the present time. Perhaps one
of them would have something useful
to contribute.
Then, too, there were the even-more-
secret annex volumes to the main in-
dexes. Those could be the real source
of paydirt. If the thing genuinely dated
to the Dislocation, it made sense to

go where the Dislocation was.
Even
if time travel was nothing but a the-
oretical proposition, that didn’t mean
the days of the Dislocation were neces-
sarily out of reach, though in a more
vicarious sense.
One of the genuine treasures of the
Archives was the truly remarkable
amount of pre- and trans-Dislocation
material scattered around.
Among
the many secrets the Archivists kept,
the scope of the Dislocation collection
was both one of the most closely held
and one of the most dangerous. When
an Archivist was assuming the man-
tle from his or her (or its, there hav-
ing been a few nonhumans in the of-
ﬁce over the years) predecessor, the
time of greatest anxiety, of nervous
glances over the shoulder and words
in a hushed voice, was when the Dis-
location stuff was discussed. Nothing

would transform the Archives from
a backwater to a strategic asset faster
than an Emperor ﬁnding out just what-
all was warehoused beneath his feet.
Telling the truth - that most of the
Dislocation material was worthless for
military or political purposes - would
have been the most futile kind of dam-
age control, the kind no one believes.
The ancients had certainly wielded
great forces and powerful technolo-
gies, and had clearly been masters of
devastating might, but there was lit-
tle doubt that the mythical stature to
which their accomplishments had been
elevated over the years was drastically
exaggerated.
They’d been helpless
against the rise of magic and the com-
ing of the gods, hadn’t they? But rea-
son would not be something to count on
in a politician let loose in a candy store
of presumed militaristic delights. So it

was a tenet of the Archivists’ ofﬁce not
to let the problem arise.
But that wasn’t even the real prob-
lem.
The gods were a jealous lot,
and an insecure one to boot.
They
might natter on about the natural
state of man being inconsistent with
ever-mare-sophisticated works of the
hands, but the real reason large-scale
or particularly useful technology was
proscribed was that they were afraid of
it. This was not merely Leen’s own the-
ory. The Dislocation texts weren’t the
only forbidden materials squirreled
away in the Archives, and for that mat-
ter weren’t the most hazardous either.
That dubious honor had to be reserved
for the small collection of fragmen-
tary holograph material attributable
to some of the gods themselves. In one
of the most intriguing manuscripts, a
certain god, Byron, had written quite

directly about the very issue of technol-
ogy and the gods’ interest in it.
Unearthing the Byron letter during
one of her girlish rummaging expedi-
tions had been the turning point that
had irrevocably set Leen on the path to
Archivist-dom. While her grandfather
had tended to what he liked to grandly
refer to as Business, Leen had begun
her ﬁrst serious research project. Over
the years, a stereotype had developed
of the Archivist as not exactly human,
but rather some hybrid of ferret and
mole, living a solitary life in dark base-
ments, with eyes grown large and weak
through excessive use under conditions
of insufﬁcient lighting. If this charac-
terization was true, and Leen was will-
ing to admit that was more than likely,
her own transformation had begun at
that time. But what else could she do?
The Byron letter was interesting.

The letter wasn’t interesting only for
its contents, either.
Intrigued by By-
ron’s openly subversive remarks, Leen
had set out to learn more about him.
She’d gone ﬁrst to the standard sup-
pressed sources, Pink’s Compendium
and the Divine Roster, and Men Into
Myth to boot, but drawn a total blank.
Even Acts and Actors, for all its demon-
strated errors still the most readable
general history, and with signiﬁcant
chunks of narrative that the others
skipped as unsubstantiated hearsay,
didn’t have a smidgen.
The
only
conclusion
Leen
could
reach was that Byron had been purged,
his very name blotted out from among
the lists of the gods. Nothing like the
Spell of Namelessness for him; Byron
had been eradicated as though he had
never existed, and the memory of the
eradication had been eradicated as

well.
If that wasn’t enough to intimidate,
Leen still thought now, thinking back
on it, she didn’t know what was.
It
gave a pretty good intimation of how
the gods would react if they discovered
the extent of the Archives’ special hold-
ings. The Empire and its ruling fami-
lies might hold special stature with the
gods, but that was because they played
a designated role in the gods’ world or-
der, and understood their limits. Even
they couldn’t sidle over the edge with-
out being slapped down as an object les-
son.
Itting III and his deal with the
monks of Leebo was a perfect case in
point. Over a singularly uncomfortable
half-hour one afternoon, Itting had rot-
ted from within in his robes of state,
while the monastery where the monks
had been tinkering under his patron-
age with an arc lamp was now a scenic

pond in the north of Gadzura, a stream
having ﬁlled in the glassy crater.
So for the Archives there were only
two courses of action.
The one that
was thinkable, secrecy, was handed
down as a central tenet of ofﬁce. Leen
supposed that every Archivist spent
an odd moment here or there contem-
plating the unthinkable option, that
of actually destroying archival mate-
rial, and with no comprehensive record
of the Archives’ full holdings it was
possible that some Archivist in the
past might have indeed followed that
course.
One of the prime candidates
for destruction, if such had really oc-
curred, would have been any documen-
tation concerning the enigma in the
hidden basement. Leen looked out at
the stacks and sighed.
It might be
a hopeless task, and it was unques-
tionably a dangerous one, but when it

came right down to it that what was
she here for, after all. Not just to dust
spines and sweep up the ﬂoor, that was
for certain.
Well, Leen had learned a lot since
her ﬁrst days under her grandfather’s
guiding but not necessarily watchful
eye. One of them was the true nature
of the Archivist’s Business.
While a
pleasantly large part of it was exactly
the rummaging and reading she had
fallen in love with in the ﬁrst place,
there remained other duties as well.
One of the inﬂexible laws of Other
Duties seemed to be that they always
most needed doing just when you’d
rather be doing something else. Well,
there was no help for it; Tuesdays were
Tuesdays. She secured the secret door
behind her and set off across the ﬂoor.
Leen paused at her desk. The three
herb volumes and the illuminated bes-

tiary were already loaded on the two-
shelf trolley, along with several books
by an obscure novelist of the previ-
ous century which she’d rescued from
the family of mice who’d been in the
process of abridging them. Was there
anything else Vellum had requested?
Where was his last note?
Oh, there,
in the clutter atop her to-do box, just
where she’d put it. Right, he was still
after the missing volume of Hali Shee’s
conﬂict precipitation treatise; it had
thus far proved elusive, but she’d have
to assure him she was still on its trail.
She had come up with the old hound-
care omnibus, though.
That was everything - darn it, no,
not quite. Leen sat down at the desk,
opened the right-hand drawer,
and
retrieved a cigar-box-size chest from
behind a sheaf of uncollated notes.
She propped it on the desk blotter,

ﬂipped back the lid, and made a face.
Beneath an untidy cap of black hair
streaked with premature strokes of
gray a face frowned back at her, itself
also streaked with the totally charac-
teristic gray of dust.
Leen wrinkled
her nose at her image in the mirror
and set to work with a cloth at making
herself presentable.
Leen’s sister had ﬁnally prevailed on
her to at least keep the mirror and a
comb at her desk. “You’re not the only
one in this family, you know,” her sis-
ter had told her menacingly. Leen had
tried for the umpteenth time to explain
to her sister the difference between hy-
giene (unquestionably important and
socially relevant) and appearance for
the sake of vanity (transitory and a
sink of precious time). Her sister had
been intransigent. “You may not care,
but just think what it does to the rest

of us,” had been Susannah’s ultima-
tum. It wasn’t until their brother had
weighed in supporting Susannah’s po-
sition (at least Leen thought that’s
what he’d been doing, when he quoted
an allusive couplet whose source was
as obscure as most of the things he
came up with) that Leen had capitu-
lated. It hadn’t been a total surrender
- Leen still refused to waste time dye-
ing her hair, and her makeup was no
more than a few strategically token
splashes - but it had gotten Susannah
off her back and away from her throat.
On that issue and for the time being,
anyway.
There was only one way to handle
chores - if you were going to do them,
you’d might as well do them right. In
this case that meant not only good but
fast. A couple of minutes, which was all
her appearance deserved in any case,

and she was ready to move out. Push-
ing the book cart ahead of her, Leen
headed for the door.
Leen was aware of two entrances
to the Archives proper.
A place with
the size and convoluted geometry of
the Archives would always give rise
to notions of disguised tunnels in the
stygian depths, sealed passages, con-
cealed doors, and whatnot.
Indeed,
certain Archivists had been ﬁends on
the subject, ﬁshing out rumors and
indulging their speculations for pages
on end in their logs.
Leen remained
skeptical.
To her knowledge no addi-
tional exits or secret passages had ever
come to light; none but the one Robin
had found, anyhow. That was just as
well. The Back and Front Doors might
have been there for centuries but that
didn’t make them prosaic. They were
a handful-and-a-half all by themselves,

which had always been plenty for her.
The Front Door actually had a door,
in contrast to the Back Door, which
was more of a trick of light and shadow
behind its alcove. The Back Door also
had its terminal pit and the Inclined
Labyrinth, of course, making the Back
Door a more scenic traverse overall, if a
somewhat longer one. Leen could nav-
igate them both in the dark, and had,
and had half a thought she could make
the excursion in her sleep, not that
that was an eventuality that seemed
likely to arise. One thing she did not
do, though, was let herself get over-
conﬁdent and hurry through. Certain
things just took as long as they took; ei-
ther you ﬁnished them or they ﬁnished
you.
That didn’t mean one didn’t get im-
patient, Leen thought, waiting for the
Front Door to recognize her and creak

open. One just had to deal with - The
large creak-and-rumble began and the
heavy arch-topped door pivoted slowly
away from her. It was hinging on the
right and outside today, Leen noted,
which might mean it was entering a
new phase of its cycle.
The next few
days would likely tell. She pushed the
cart through the door into the safety
zone in the vestibule and saw the cart
tucked away in its dumbwaiter niche,
took a few deep breaths from her di-
aphragm, and set her feet on the ﬁrst
keypoints of the recessional path.
Time always came to resemble taffy
on your way in and out, Leen had
been taught. This go-around, for some
reason the null zones zipped past with-
out note while the Watermark, of all
junctures, was turbulent, its airspace
dragging at her with the approximate
consistency of ﬂypaper. Have to check

the hair again, she found herself think-
ing irrelevantly, as she gyrated her
way through and into the Great Room
with its self-importance ﬁeld.
Finally Leen debarked through the
door at the other end, at the top of
the ﬂight of invisible steps. Archivist
Creeley had known what he was doing
when he’d set up the wards guarding
the Archives, and the whole tradition
of Archivism as well, but he’d clearly
possessed a sadistic streak. Leen stag-
gered past the door jamb and collapsed
into the chair just beyond. After a mo-
ment, when her heartbeat had slowed,
she took up the pitcher of tea from
the end table next to the chair and
drained half of it in one long gurgle; re-
hydration was important. But so was
exercise, and Leen could tell she was
getting out of shape.
She’d have to reorganize her sched-

ule to allow more time for a workout.
Leen wasn’t ready to turn things over
to a new Archivist, by any means, and
anyway who was there who’d be up for
it? Robin was barely more than an in-
fant, although already a promising one,
and even though Vellum wasn’t an in-
fant he might have already gone as far
as he could.
On cue, the man appeared.
As li-
brarian in charge of the Reading Room,
traditionally the senior member of
the
Archivist’s
small
staff,
Vellum
had been a political appointee, but
had proved nonetheless qualiﬁed even
given the patronage involved. Still, the
talents required to navigate the Door-
ways were more than just a sense for
books.
“Good day, Archivist,” Vellum
said.
“Another early morning, I take
it?”
“Uh huh. The books I could ﬁnd are

there if you want to haul them up.”
“Oh, good,” said Vellum. “The Potamia
herbal?” He grasped the large windlass
crank mounted in the wall and began
to haul it around.
“Yes,” Leen said, “I found the herbals.
The bestiary, too.”
“Lord What’s-his-name will be pleased
about that.”
Lord What’s-his-name?
Who had
she seen around lately?
“Lord Farns-
brother?” asked Leen.
“Lord? - yes, the very one.”
“Farnsbrother doesn’t read,” Leen
muttered. “What’s he doing, starting a
zoo?”
Vellum was of middling height, a bit
stoop-shouldered, his most notable fea-
tures the matching set of bifocal spec-
tacles and watery eyes; a recruiting-
poster image of a bibliothecary, in fact.
Like the typical librarian, he also had

a dangerous tendency toward aloof-
ness and a disregard of the occasional
political implications of the job. He cer-
tainly had a spirit for books, though,
and had thrown himself into the work
- he’d adopted his new name when he’d
taken the position.
Vellum gave a ﬁnal heave on the
crank and the cart of books rose into
view in the dumbwaiter slot, none the
worse for wear. The books, being in the
traditional sense lifeless, were able to
transit the maze without destruction.
And a good thing, too - you’d never
get a handcart up those stairs. Leen
followed Vellum and the cart into the
back stacks of the Reading Room.
Leen sometimes thought of the Read-
ing Room as a decoy for scholars, to
keep them away from the real stuff
squirreled away in the Archives proper.
In truth that was actually an under-

statement;
the Reading Room was
impressive in its own right, even by
comparison with the Archives. In fact,
to the extent the public mind knew
that something called the Archives ex-
isted, it thought Reading Room and
Archives were one and the same. Any-
one surveying the Reading Room’s
holdings, its warren of shelves and
reading nooks, of drafty ceilings and
precarious overhangs, would naturally
wonder how there could be that many
books and papers in the whole world;
anyone who didn’t know better,
at
any rate.
They turned a corner and
now Leen could see the large central
chamber ahead. To their right at the
intersection was a section walled off
with iron bars and a locked gate, the
tomes inside it lashed to their shelves
with stout chains.
Leen patted her
key ring out of reﬂex and saw Vellum

do the same. State secrets or arcana
of the gods weren’t the only perilous
materials in the stacks.
The Thau-
maturgical area was off-limits to all
but qualiﬁed readers, at least as much
for the protection of the browser as out
of a need to control dissemination of
that particular information.
The cool hush of the great room beck-
oned as they drew closer, and then the
hall itself was opening around them
- the clerestory windows around the
base of the dome, the allegorical fres-
coes marching up the curves of the
dome itself, the mahogany balconies,
the long reading tables and stand-up
lecterns, the statuary, the portraits of
emperors and Archivists both, the mar-
ble ﬂoors; all in all, quite an ediﬁce.
And it was Tuesday, so the Archivist
was In.
The be-monocled Lord Farnsbrother

was already waiting at her desk, his
jowls waggling with impatience.
The
ends of a marten stole dangled by his
waist, crossing on their way down from
his neck an assortment of chest-jewels
and a brocade robe.
Farnsbrother’s
family tree had its roots back before
the Bones.
For the last few genera-
tions they’d done little but live off their
foreign rents and an imperial grant
at one of the smallest Living Mines;
the last time Leen had reviewed the
peerage Farnsbrother had been the
sole hope of continuing the family line.
From the look of him, a judicious wager
on behalf of extinction might not be in-
appropriate. “I say,” Lord Farnsbrother
addressed Vellum, “do you have it?
The Beast-Book?”
“As you requested, Lord, it has been
found.” Vellum passed it over.
Farnsbrother eagerly ﬂipped pages.

Leen winced; several of the signatures
had already seemed loose, and the
spine itself might not stand up to ex-
treme handling. As he neared the back
of the book, though, Farnsbrother’s
face darkened.
He spoke in an omi-
nous tone.
“This – this book shows
only land animals, and a few birds
and things.” Farnsbrother struck the
current page with the back of his hand.
The leaf he struck was one of text il-
luminated in black and red pen with
gold leaf accents; the facing page il-
lustration showed a nicely executed
grifﬁn rampant, clutching of all things
a salmon in its upraised claw.
“Why, yes,” said Leen.
“They are
what Fernandez was known for.”
“But -” Lord Farnsbrother sputtered,
“but - there’s no sea creatures. There’s
barely enough time as it is! - I abso-
lutely must get the shipyard to work to-

day, or my barge just will not be ready.
Do you understand? It will - not - be -
ready!”
“Your barge? Not ready?”
“Not in time,” said Farnsbrother
crossly.
“And I’m certain this Squid-
thing won’t wait.”
Squid-thing? Oh! - of course, that
Squid-thing.
“You plan to decorate
your barge for the occasion, Lord -”
“Not just decorate, woman! It’s the
whole superstructure: it has to be re-
built.
It must be the right theme!
These birds and cattle just will not do,
they will not do at all!”
Leen raised a hand.
“Lord Farns-
brother, you have still come to the
right place.
Now that I understand
your needs, we can show you just the
reference you’re looking for.”
Farnsbrother paused in his gesticu-
lations.
“Oh, can you really?
That’s

dashed timely, I don’t mind telling you.
If I -”
“Say no more,” Leen told him. “I will
not keep you a moment longer from
your destiny.
Vellum, please show
Lord Farnsbrother to the oceanogra-
phy section, and stay to assist him in
his research, will you?”
“This way, my Lord,” said Vellum,
leading the suddenly uplifted peer to-
ward the stacks.
Leen collapsed into
her chair. Tuesdays, bah! Business!
And
the
“Squid-thing.”
Unfortu-
nately that was only the barest part
of it,
although it was indisputably
a highlight.
Fortunately these were
days of stability and the emperors had
lately been a hardy lot; Leen didn’t
think civilization could stand a Knit-
ting more than once a decade at the
outside.
Already Peridol was getting
to be so crowded with out-of-towners

you could barely cross a street at three
in the morning, and the revelry hadn’t
even ofﬁcially started yet. It would be
difﬁcult to ﬁt a decent day’s work in
edgewise. With such a round of parties
and festivities coming up she couldn’t
possibly arrange to miss all of them,
could she?
Her well-known absent-mindedness
would no doubt be good for a few, even
if there were far too many far-too-loyal
retainers around to keep reminding
her of where she needed to be and
when, but even she couldn’t use that ex-
cuse for everything. Being unpleasant
wouldn’t help much either; in Leen’s
circles most everyone was unpleas-
ant, but that never stopped them from
being invited or expected to attend.
Damn, Leen thought.
It wouldn’t be
just makeup, either. I suppose I’ll have
to break down and have my hair cut.

Susannah, Robin’s mother, would
unquestionably be in the thick of it,
and their own mother too for that mat-
ter.
Her sister was a bit of a dope,
but you certainly couldn’t say that of
Mother.
Or Lemon for that matter.
Leen might have inherited her grand-
father’s archival talents down the line
through her father (who, for all one
could tell, had missed out on brains en-
tirely himself), but her brother Lemon
had gotten the legacy of her mother’s
side of the family in full force. Lemon
would be having a ﬁne time for him-
self over the next few weeks as well,
if not for quite the same reasons as
Susannah and Mother.
There would
be the usual ﬂirting and dalliance,
eating to excess and dancing, too, if
not quite enough of the latter to com-
pensate for the former, but above all
for Lemon there would be Business.

Not the same Business as Leen’s, of
course. He’d be out for himself and his
own machinations, that went without
saying; Lemon’s entanglements were
almost impossibly complex. She’d have
to ask him again what he was up to.
Not that he’d tell her, or at least not
that he’d tell her in a straightforward
enough fashion that a mere person
could understand, but -
“Excuse me, my dear.”
Leen looked smoothly up from the
ledger where she’d ostensibly been re-
viewing Vellum’s account of the recent
repairs to the dome. If you were going
to go through life gathering wool, she
had decided many years ago, it was
only prudent to develop a few devices
to keep the habit under wraps. After
years of practice, she could now dream
off standing up, that was an easy one,
and she could go into fugue seated at a

desk without her shoulders slipping or
her head nodding, so that a casual ob-
server, especially from the back, would
presume she was merely engrossed in
study. The bigger trick was to return
smoothly to full awareness and orien-
tation without a gap in conversation,
and without the audience becoming
aware you’d ever been away.
“My apologies for disturbing you,”
the man went on. “You appeared lost
in thought, but the sign here on your
desk does indicate your ofﬁcial pres-
ence.”
Well, sometimes it worked and some-
times it didn’t. The face looking down
on her was tanned, bearing a dark mus-
tache in bold contrast to the ﬂashing
white teeth set in an insouciant grin;
above were blue eyes and a shock of
dark hair. The body, all swelling shoul-
ders, muscular chest, and trim waist,

was encased in a discretely ﬂashy out-
ﬁt of scarlet and jet, except for the
peak of the left shoulder blade curv-
ing around to the back, which shone
with a swath of silver. Leen could see
the shoulder blade since the man was
leaning over her with his left elbow
on the desk just in front of her ledger,
bringing his head within whispering
distance of her ear, but even if his rip-
pling back had been hidden from view
she would have known the silver of
ofﬁce was there.
“Good day, my lord
Scapula,” Leen said. “Is there a partic-
ular title I might assist you with?”
“A title?” said the Scapula. “Ah yes,
a title. Well, then, let us say my title of
interest today is Arleen.”
Is this research or just casual brows-
ing? Leen thought. She didn’t say it,
though; she didn’t want to get started
with him.
“Shall I show you to the

card catalog, or will directions be sufﬁ-
cient?”
The Scapula made his eyes smolder.
The man did have exceptional animal
magnetism, not that that was any con-
cern of hers, of course. “Your personal
accompaniment is exactly what I was
planning on,” he told her.
“Although
the idea of instruction does have inter-
esting potentialities. Please, then, in-
struct me in your will. Or no, on sec-
ond thought please don’t.” He ﬂashed
his teeth at her. “I feel I know your true
will much better than you do yourself.”
“Tell me how much I’ve left to my
nephew Robin, then,” Leen said under
her breath.
Did his eyes narrow the merest
bit?
Well, probably, and she didn’t
care if he’d heard her, either. But she
couldn’t just tell him to get lost, not the
Scapula; he wasn’t exactly some run-

of-the-streets masher, no matter how
he acted. Was he here alone, or had he
brought an entourage? Over by the en-
cyclopedias was a small knot of minor
Digitals; that was the sort of gang he
might have trailing along behind him.
They were arguing in low voices over
something spread out between them
on the top of the half-height bookcase,
though, and now that Leen thought
about it she half-remembered them
straggling in by themselves a quarter-
hour or so before. Assume the Scapula
was alone, then. That meant she could
speak more openly, without the fear
of precipitating some vendetta necessi-
tated by the presence of witnesses.
On the other hand, absence of wit-
nesses meant that he could act more
openly, too. He raised a hand as she
began to speak again and applied it
gently but ﬁrmly across her mouth.

“The festivities of this season of our joy
are almost upon us,” the Scapula mur-
mured. “Shortly the new lord of us all
will walk in our midst for the ﬁrst time
in his aspect of state, and the great
gala will begin. Surely, even with the
demands of your responsibilities you
will venture forth into the season? At
the Inauguration Ball, say, in partic-
ular?
It would be my honor to have
you accompany me.
I warn you, you
may speak only to indicate assent.” He
raised an eyebrow at her.
She frowned down at the hand still
covering
her
mouth
and
wondered
about biting it. Better not; that would
most likely only encourage him. Had
she once heard that he liked to be nib-
bled? Violent eroticism would be fully
in keeping with his public persona, and
what she had heard of his private one,
too.

But why was he after her, of all peo-
ple? Aloof though she tried to be, Leen
knew she wasn’t beautiful enough to be
anyone’s ice lady, and no one had come
after her for her mind, either, but that
was just as well; she had long ago de-
cided she was well-suited for spinster-
hood by natural temperament and in-
clination anyway. True, she was in the
line of succession, somewhere, but no
one was about to arrange her marriage
for the good of the state. And a good
thing no one was dumb enough to try,
either.
So what was the Scapula up to?
Well, as long as she could breathe,
she could ultimately outlast him. He
couldn’t
be
very
comfortable
bent
across the desk like that.
And then
there was the possibility of a diversion
-
Leen
heard
an
awkward
cough

next to her chair.
Yes, Vellum, and
about time, too. “Excuse me, my lord,
Archivist, might I help you?”
The look the Scapula turned on Vel-
lum was no little smolder, it was a
full-scale roast. But his grip did relax
enough for Leen to slip backward out
of his grasp; she kicked her chair away
from the desk, too, for good measure.
“Thank you, Vellum,” she said, “but
no.
My lord Scapula and I were just
discussing the catalog holdings.”
“As you say, Archivist,” Vellum mut-
tered with relief, and quickly vanished
back into the stacks.
The Scapula’s gaze had toned it-
self back down when it returned to
her. “Let us discuss the arrangements,
then, shall we?”
“This is a place of serious business,
my lord Scapula, not a spot for assigna-
tion.”

“Are the two ever long separated?”
stated the Scapula. “Very well, let us
say I make you my business. Will this
simple entreaty sufﬁce to win me the
pleasure of your company, or must I
pursue you further? You will see, I will
not be denied.”
Leen paused.
They moved in the
same social circles, or would, if Leen
bothered to circulate socially more
than the required minimum. This was
not to say they’d ever been anything
more than casual acquaintances. Well,
that wasn’t entirely true; they’d been
partnered at one of the Pectoral Duke’s
out-of-town weekends a year or two
back. Leen had avoided him as much
as possible, sitting through meals and
doing the required dances but other-
wise escaping to her research in the
old Duke’s library.
As Leen recalled,
she hadn’t slept with him either. Her

ignoring him could have caused a bit
of a stir if he hadn’t been so clearly
pursuing Crewtenﬁeld’s young wife;
had gotten her, too, if Leen recalled
correctly. Oh, Leen knew who he was,
all right, but then so did all of Peridol.
The Scapula was clearly one to watch.
The buzz had him a clear contender;
at the rate he was moving, the next
Knitting might very well be his.
There was some shady bit of fam-
ily business in his past, which only
made him ﬁt right in with everyone
else in the upper crust. There was also
more than a whiff of menace. People
who opposed him had a tendency to
shift their views abruptly, or equally
abruptly decide to leave town for an
extended stay in some out-of-the-way
province or another.
That, too, was
only the way the game was played; the
Scapula wouldn’t be a serious prospect

for emperor if he couldn’t take care of
his affairs with the efﬁciency of any
appropriate means.
But Leen didn’t want to be a player,
even at second hand. “You’re not after
me for myself, Lord Scapula, and you
certainly don’t want me for my looks.
I’m aloof, I have a nasty temperament,
and I’ve got a bad habit of speaking my
mind, so you’re not here for my charm
either. Why are you bothering me?”
“Spirit is a rare commodity,” said
the Scapula, “the genuine sort of spirit
at any rate. As one moves up in the
world one primarily encounters the
sycophant in all his servile guises; the
ﬂatterer, the toady, the truckler. Not
that there isn’t some satisfaction from
the cringing masses ﬂinging them-
selves at your feet, you understand,
but the gratiﬁcation is limited. Master-
ing those who aren’t fully alive; what

challenge is there in that?”
So you say I’m fully alive, and you’ve
decided to master me? Hah! thought
Leen. A likely story. “Is it my brother,”
Leen said. “You want something out of
him? Or if it’s Susannah you’ve got in
mind there’s no need to bother with me;
just walk up to her and ask her. Toss
a sterling silver rose at her feet if you
want, she’d like that even more.”
The Scapula had adjusted his posi-
tion, seating himself companionably
on the edge of her desk.
He passed
one hand over his opposite sleeve, and
when he turned over his palm a ﬂower
nestled there, its thorny stem trailing
up his arm; a sterling silver rose. He
tossed it down in front of her. “You are
a far rarer catch than you give yourself
credit for. In addition to your strength
of personality, intellect, and ﬁgure, you
are also unmarried and unattached.”

He
raised his
eyebrows
guilelessly.
“Your sister is none of these.”
“That’s never stopped anybody be-
fore,” Leen muttered. She stared at the
ﬂower lying across her book. “What am
I supposed to do with that?”
“A bud vase is the usual implement,
ﬁlled one-third to halfway with clear
water.”
Everyone always thought they were
a comedian. “You have one of those up
your sleeve too? ... Oh, really. You’re
not serious.” She was sorry she’d asked.
“There you are,” pronounced the
Scapula,
inserting
the
rose
neatly
through the neck of the vase. It was
foolish, she knew, but she had always
had a soft spot for crystal; was this gift
accidental, or had he known? Regard-
less of his motivations, the vase was
actually rather nice; the classic ﬂuted
shape with splayed petals at the top

and a family crest etched delicately
into the neck.
“You have any more parlor tricks you
intend to show me, or were you ready
to leave?”
“This is scarcely a parlor,” the Scapula
said softly, “nor are all my skills appro-
priate for a general audience.”
“Indeed,” said Leen.
“Your reputa-
tion speaks for itself. It speaks quite
widely, too, I might add.”
He turned up the heat on his gaze
again. “Madame Librarian, it is a time
to be seen, not to cower away in this
tomb of an Archive.
Perhaps I’ve of-
fended you?
Well then, let me make
amends. Accompany me. Be at my side.
After that, who can say?”
“I can say, and I can say it right now.
Thank you, but no.”
“Very well,” said the Scapula, getting
to his feet. “Since you prefer to think

about what you plan to wear, you give
me the pleasure of conferring with you
again on the ﬁnal details.” He cocked
his head for a moment in thought. “I
will have my couturier call,” he decided.
“A cosmetologist, too, perhaps.”
“You’re forgetting your vase.”
“Not at all. Accept it as my gift, in
memory of our little tryst.” He moved
in a blur; before Leen knew what was
happening, he had her hand clasped
ﬁrmly in his and was pressing it to his
mouth. He paused, launched a last few
eye-embers at her over her upraised
arm, then placed her hand back down
on her ledger. Finally he bowed, said
“Good day, my dear,” and turned and
glided toward the exit.
As her grandfather liked to say,
land’s sake! She didn’t have time for
this. What a bother ...
Of course, he was rather attractive,

in his way, and she was human ...
No, Leen told herself. Totally out of
the question.
She was a professional
person, at the top of her profession in
fact, and he and his balls and galas and
vases and whatever-else were nothing
but a distraction.
Probably part of
some plot, too, for all anyone knew.
Completely out of the question. She’d
just take the vase and hide it in a back
drawer somewhere, or better yet drop
it in the trash ...
But the vase really was rather strik-
ing, at that. It rang at the touch of a
ﬁngertip, and the etching was fairly re-
markable, with a delicate sense of line
and a nicely executed jaguar head in
proﬁle. Perhaps she’d let it sit for a day
or two before she tossed it out.

Chapter6
“LOOKS LIKE WE’LL BE IN PORT
SOON,” commented Zalzyn Shaa.
“Aye, that it does,” Captain Luff said.
“This vessel is seaworthy and ship-
shape as ever?”
“It’s my job to make sure that it is,
don’t you know.”
“You are ever-zealous of your job,”
Shaa said.
“Whatever vicissitudes
may befall, that much is indisputable.
Therefore it would be the blackest and

most unexpected of luck were some-
thing to arise that would keep us from
the docks, say a sudden typhoon or
a seismic sea wave or a submarine
boarding party of pirates.”
Captain
Luff
looked
deliberately
upwards. The sky above the Not Un-
reasonable Proﬁt was sunny, sparkling
blue, and cloudless, ﬁlled with wheel-
ing sea- and land-birds screeching and
cawing with frenetic delight. For that
matter, the quarterdeck allowed a par-
ticularly pleasant vantage point for
enjoying the spectacle, too, if one was
so inclined, at the cost of an occasional
dive-bombing run from above.
The
Captain lowered his gaze to the scene
around them. The ship had passed the
famous
Hutchison
Point
lighthouse
at dawn to enter the South Chan-
nel, and had by now progressed to
its middle reaches.
The island land-

mass of Gadzura-the-Home was much
the closer, off the port beam, so close
in fact that the small group of hook-
and-line men casting from the end of
the narrow land-spit they were now
passing were clearly visible, without
the need of deploying his spyglass. The
headlands of the Ruponian mainland
were nothing more than a smear of
gray far off to starboard across the
breadth of the channel.
The water itself was running a
sou’westerly light chop, but as they
were now behind Gadzura’s sheltering
bulk the inﬂuence of wind and wave
would be somewhat moderated.
The
prudent seaman would take heed of
the ampliﬁed tides, of course, and keep
a weather eye peeled for the intense
storms the Channel brewed up now
and then. As Captain Luff didn’t mind
admitting to himself, the prudent na-

ture of this crew - and this captain -
had behind it the testament of years
and leagues of unassailable fact, un-
blemished save by the questionable
decision to give passage to the cur-
rent load of excursionists. In any case,
though, prudent or not, it was as per-
fect a day for being at sea as you were
likely to ﬁnd in the normal course of
events.
Theirs was by no means the
only vessel to be taking advantage of
it, either.
Under normal circumstances,
the
port of Peridol was already the largest
and busiest in the world. On any day
of the year, save those of the ﬁercest
weather or the greatest nautical fes-
tivals, the navigation channels would
be ﬁlled with the trafﬁc of global com-
merce as well as the local ﬁshing ﬂeet.
By the look of things around them
today was no exception, but the sit-

uation today didn’t end there.
On
top of the normal business congestion,
the weather had brought out a raft of
pleasure boaters in their schooners,
ketches,
and
other
fore-and-afters,
and even a few hardy rowers in their
caiques. Add to all that the Knitting -
well, what more did you have to say?
Captain Luff was a practical man;
he would never accept the possibility of
crossing from Gadzura to Ruponia dry-
shod by leaping from deck to adjacent
deck. No, it was clearly an optical illu-
sion; it only looked as though it could
be done. Several pilot ships were out
trying to keep a rein on the congestion
and herd ships into the proper naviga-
tion lanes, but their cause was clearly
lost. They were beset on every quarter
by clippers, galleons, galleys, barges,
hoys, junks, sampans, xebecs, luggers,
packets, ferries, dhows, round ships,

lorchas,
caravels,
feluccas,
galiots,
smacks, trawlers, cascos, a coasting
patamar, a baglo, even the occasional
dahabeah with its lateen rig, and there
a twin-masted pindjajap with the char-
acteristically cantilevered stem and
stern. At least the ﬁshing vessels were
not actually setting out nets; now that
would be madness. Even so, Captain
Luff observed as a pinnace darted out
from behind the barkentine off the star-
board quarter and ﬂashed under their
bow, you could conclude there was a
fair bit of a crowd.
Shaa’s hopes for
extraordinary
intervention
notwith-
standing, the only danger they were
running at the moment was that of
collision.
It might be wiser not to suggest that
to him, though. “If you’re bent on con-
templating unnatural fates,” Captain
Luff told him, “you can rule out any

leviathans of the deep while you’re at
it, seeing as the waters are shoaling
rapidly, and the lures for the Running
will not yet have been placed.”
Shaa
grunted,
his
glower
osten-
tatiously underlining his singularly
unimpressed attitude toward the wa-
terborne spectacle around them. “Yes,
I thought as much.”
Captain Luff peered into his pipe.
It had gone dry a few minutes or so
back, in the middle of a sticky spot
involving a wizard-drive sternwheeler
that had come tearing out of nowhere
and half to swamped them;
expen-
sive piece of work that vessel had
been, though, even without the ma-
hogany railings and the gold-leaf and
the mother-of-pearl ﬁgurehead. Some
god’s pleasure yacht, more than likely.
“Second thoughts are we having then,
Dr. Shaa?”

“Always,” Shaa said gloomily.
“Didn’t I hear sometime back that
Peridol was once your home?” com-
mented the Captain.
Might as well
just stow the pipe away, there’d be no
time to get it started again, especially
with that four-master up ahead look-
ing to be shortening sail any moment
now.
“In certain cases, ‘you can’t go home
again’ is more than just a ﬁgure of
speech.”
Ronibet Karlini topped the stair
from the lower deck just in time to
hear Shaa’s last pronouncement. “I’ve
a good mind to smack you over the
head,” she told him.
“Free speech is an ideal always in
risk. Smack away, then, if you must.”
Shaa spread his arms wide and tilted
his head back to expose his throat.
“That’s your whole problem,” Roni

said.
“You can’t look at yourself any
more without seeing a victim.
Who
was it who used to bore everybody’s
ears off with all that stuff about the
limits of fate and the power of will?
Couldn’t have been you; you’ve got a
martyr complex.”
“They say it’s a profession with a fu-
ture.”
Roni studied him suspiciously as the
captain strode to the quarterdeck rail
and shouted a series of rapid orders
to the crew on deck and in the rigging.
The helmsman swung the wheel and
the ship heeled to port. “Shall we brace
for impact?” Shaa said hopefully.
“Not this time,” Captain Luff shot
back over his shoulder.
“Ah, well,” said Shaa.
The four-
master, much of its canvas now taken
in, slipped backward toward them off
the starboard bow.

Roni approached, still watching him
warily. “What is wrong with you?”
Shaa met her gaze for a moment,
then deliberately looked off along the
deck. “Your ward appears ripe for ro-
mance.”
Tildamire Mont was down on the
main deck taking in the excitement.
From the direction of her attention,
the more stimulating elements of the
scene included the exertions of the
half-clad sailors clambering along the
yardarms.
“What’s such a bad thing about
that?” said Roni. “You could have had
her interested in you if you wanted;
you probably still could. Or is it some-
thing else? - I wouldn’t have thought
you’re fuddy-duddy material.
You’re
not turning into a prune after all these
years, are you?”
He shrugged. “My circumstances of

late have been different than those of
my youth. The Peridol lifestyle fails to
translate well to that of the road.”
“In case you didn’t notice, that’s Peri-
dol up there a few hours ahead. You
want to recapture your youth, I’m sure
Peridol will be more than happy to
oblige you.”
Shaa rolled an eye in her direction.
“The thought did not entirely escape
my mind,” he allowed.
“The circum-
stances do present themselves for one
terminal spree.”
“Terminal - there you go again with
the fatalism.”
Shaa shrugged.
“Fate is fate.
In-
deed, I have an advantage over others;
they can merely speculate on what in-
evitabilities destiny may hold for them,
whereas I know the tenets of my de-
cree. Max thinks he can overturn the
curse of fate, but that’s Max for you,

hubris up to his gills.”
“Give me excess pride any day over
this giving up and waiting to die. What,
is your heart acting up more?”
“Yes,” he said testily.
“My heart is
acting up. You’re welcome to address
it directly if you like. Perhaps you can
harangue it into submission. Speaking
of admonitions, how is the Great one
this morning?”
“Fine,” said Roni.
“Of course ﬁne,
why shouldn’t he be ﬁne?”
“I see,” Shaa said, seeing in fact
more than he would rather have pre-
ferred.
“What was that?” said Roni. Captain
Luff, facing away from them, had mum-
bled something unintelligible into his
pipe.
Shaa, though, had heard the state-
ment well enough.
The captain had
been muttering about dissension in

the ranks.
It was no more than bald truth. They
were scarcely the happy band of days
of yore. No better example presented
itself than the Karlini lovebirds. Roni
could barely mention Karlini without
snapping at him in absentia, while
Karlini had placed himself on perma-
nent iceberg watch, presumably; that
was the most charitable explanation
for his constant sulking in the bow.
A ﬁne bunch they were turning into,
the captain’s remark made no mistake
about that.
If these were still the old days, this
would be just the time for Shaa to step
in, smoothing rufﬂed feelings, stilling
riled waters, introducing the grease
of reason to the squeak of discord,
knitting them all back together again.
That had been one of Shaa’s jobs, not
that any of them had ever spelled it out

quite like that, and he had done it well,
too. In many ways it had perhaps been
Shaa’s most important job, in fact. But
what was it to him any more anyway?
He’d soon be off this particular coil,
most likely, his role done if not neces-
sarily complete. And all the plots and
plans and twists and turns would still
go on without him at least as smoothly
as they’d done with him present on the
scene. Things might even be improved
- he’d be one less ramiﬁcation for the
rest of them to stumble over.
Indeed, after this many years of long-
range plans and ultimate goals all the
agitation came to seem rather point-
less.
Max might never question, but
then Max was Max. It wasn’t only the
ends one could question, either, but the
means. Things were so complex and in-
tertwined that it was a wonder any of
them could sort through it and tell tail

from head.
They had all contributed
their threads of plot, which was ﬁne by
itself except for the fact that none of
them ever seemed to tie their threads
off when they were ﬁnished. Not only
that, they’d taken to picking up new
plots off the street, too; just look at the
Creeping Sword.
That other classic admonition came
to mind, the one concerning the ex-
cess of cooks and their rancid soup.
Of course, that maxim probably broke
down under the requirements of prepar-
ing a large banquet, where the problem
might be one of management and dele-
gation rather than stafﬁng, per se, al-
though Shaa had to admit that his lack
of background in food service left him
insufﬁciently competent to conclude
that question unambiguously one way
or the other.
That question, along
with so many others, looked as though

it would just remain unanswered, at
least as far as Zalzyn Shaa would ever
know.
Roni, watching him sink deeper into
his funk, had never seen Shaa like this
before. She’d known he wasn’t looking
forward to the prospect of returning to
his old home town. Not only was he no
longer bothering to conceal his discom-
fort, though, he was all but wallowing
in it. “Don’t forget your curse isn’t au-
tomatic,” Roni said. “It has to be imple-
mented. You could lie low while we do
the legwork. We can head it off.”
“That’s not all of it,” said Shaa, “you
know that’s not all of it at all.
Even
if I try to wall myself up in a basement,
this is Peridol. I’m certain to encounter
my brother.”
“It’s been a long time.
Maybe you
could reason with him now.”
“You’re wasting your time,” Shaa

said.
“Furthermore, you know you’re
wasting your time.”
“Then kill him,” Roni spat. “Just go
ahead and kill him, be rid of him once
and for all. Then go ahead and worry
about his curse.”
“Don’t you think I’d love to do that?”
“So do it. Or let one of us do it.”
Shaa
abruptly
turned
away
and
strode to the starboard rail. He grasped
a marlinspike and pulled himself up
so that he could look over the side,
into the strip of rushing water between
their ship and the next one, now all of
half-a-cable further out. He’s not seri-
ous, thought Roni. But all of a sudden
serious was just exactly what Shaa did
look like. “Get down from there,” Roni
said. “What do you think you’re up to?”
“It would save everyone a lot of trou-
ble,” Shaa said.
The water pounded
by under his gaze.
It was quite hyp-

notic, really, when you looked at things
like this. There were disciplines of the
mind and will that stressed contem-
plation of the natural world to focus
one’s spirit.
Perhaps he should have
given them more attention; it was a re-
markably honing experience, to match
internal and external contemplation
under -
A hand closed on the back of his coat
and deposited Shaa unceremoniously
back on the quarterdeck. “There will
be none of this on my ship,” said Cap-
tain Luff, shoving his glaring face up
against Shaa’s nose. “I will not stand
for it. Are you clear on that?”
“... Very well,” said Shaa. “Aye.”
“I’m surprised at you, Dr.
Shaa.”
Captain Luff noted with satisfaction
that Shaa’s eyes,
which had been
sneaking back to eye the gunwales,
now ﬂickered up and met his. “What-

ever you say to the contrary, your spe-
cialty is trouble. If your fate lies ahead
in Peridol, well then, man, just use
your natural talent. You could be more
nettlesome than ever before. Not this
nonsense; no, this is not for the likes of
you.”
“Are you a natural philosopher now,
too?” Shaa said, but it was clear his
heart wasn’t in it. “Just let me know
when we reach the dock.” He pulled
clear of the captain’s grip, slunk to the
companionway, and vanished below.
Captain Luff and Roni watched him
go.
“Is this about his brother, then?”
asked the captain.
Tildy Mont, who was turning out
to have a gift for observation along
with her other ﬂowering talents, had
mentioned to Roni that Shaa’s style
of speaking seemed to infect people
who hung around with him too long.

It hadn’t happened to Karlini,
but
then Karlini was probably too absent-
minded to pay enough attention to
anyone’s words in the ﬁrst place. Roni
knew Shaa’s patterns had affected her
over the years, however, and not only
his speech, either. From the way the
captain was starting to talk it looked as
though the spell of Shaa had claimed
another victim here, too. “Arznaak’s a
big part of it,” Roni said. “Shaa hasn’t
been back to Peridol since his father’s
death and Arznaak’s curse. That was
part of the idea of the curse, to keep
him away from his family and force
him to wander the earth.”
“But his heart’s going out on him
now because of another part of the
curse,” said Captain Luff, “do I have
that aright?
So you all ﬁgured he
didn’t have anything to lose by coming
back to Peridol and defying that side of

the thing?”
“Something like that.”
Captain Luff clenched his unlit pipe
ﬁrmly between his teeth. “If this Arz-
naak’s the key, then, why is he still
around, with your lot being as nasty as
you are, begging your pardon, m’am?”
Roni sighed. “When you said Shaa’s
best skill is causing trouble, you sure
got that one right. Shaa won’t let any
of us touch his brother.
He made a
promise.”
The captain began to shake his head.
Up ahead, though, a barge was putting
out from an inlet on the shoreline off
to port; ships were peeling off to star-
board to get out of its way.
It took
a good ten minutes to sort the sea
lane out again after that, and by the
time Captain Luff was free to look
around once more Roni had long since
departed. He shook his head another

time for good measure. In truth, Shaa
and his lot were no end of trouble.
Their crowning achievement, as far as
Captain Luff was concerned, was just
now becoming evident. He was ﬁnally
on the verge of being rid of them once
and for all, an event that should have
ﬁlled him with a judicious sense of re-
lease and rejoicing, but here they were
getting under his skin. A full kettle of
trouble they were, and no mistaking.
Below decks as well, the kettle was
still brewing.
“Perhaps bad as they
seem not are things,” Haddo had told
Shaa when he’d come down from the
quarterdeck into the darkness of the
passage below.
Shaa had grunted at
him to cover his momentary startle-
ment at hearing Haddo’s voice out of
the blackness. He shouldn’t have been
surprised; Shaa knew full well how
much Haddo enjoying lurking in shad-

ows and poking his cloak into other
folks’ business.
Haddo enjoyed it as
much as they all did, it was some-
thing that linked them all together as
a shared society of busybodies.
“A lid on it put,” had been Shaa’s
only response. Haddo had faded back
to wherever he’d come from, and Shaa
had continued on to have a good solid
grouse, adrift (as he thought of it) in
the mental Sargasso. Perhaps he’d run
across Karlini there.
Actually, Shaa thought the funda-
mentals of his funk and Karlini’s might
be much the same, whatever the differ-
ences in proximate causes or the binds
that might be facing them. Were they
just being swept along by Max’s plot-
ting because they didn’t have anything
better to do, because they weren’t will-
ing to exert themselves to take control
over their own lives? Had Shaa’s life

been controlled by external forces for
so long that he’d forgotten how to do
anything but ﬂoat along with them?
Getting rid of the gods was Max’s goal,
not one that had excited Shaa much
in some time; in fact he hadn’t really
had a major goal lately other than
just staying alive. Now even that goal
might most probably be out of reach.
That’s not the real problem, though,
Shaa reﬂected. The real problem was
that there didn’t seem to be much point
in trying.
Shaa
only
realized
that
several
hours must have passed when Haddo’s
voice ﬂoated again out of the shad-
ows to announce, “Approaching are
we wharves.” Shaa took a few deep
breaths to try to quiet his heart, which
had gone into a rapid pounding run
when Haddo had spoken up behind
him, and climbed back to the deck,

his ankles feeling particularly water-
logged. The short climb left him pant-
ing. Well, one thing Peridol always had
in abundance were his fellow physi-
cians; perhaps one among them had
perfected the two things Shaa needed
most, curse removal and transplanta-
tion of hearts. In the air were still the
wheeling seabirds, but now stretched
out around the ship was the harbor of
Peridol’s south port.
They had obviously passed the great
moles while Shaa was still hiding in
the dark.
Wharves and docks, jet-
ties, slips, quays, and embarkments
surrounded them, the trafﬁc from the
channel squeezing itself into the tide-
ways under the guiding signal ﬂags
of
the
outnumbered
harbormasters.
The main channel was already barely
visible behind them. The Tongue Wa-
ter would be off somewhere off to the

northeast,
but the cluster of ware-
houses and light industry on the Hook
concealed even the arching bridges
from view.
Rather than breaking out the sweeps,
Captain Luff still had the Not Un-
reasonable Proﬁt under judicious sail.
Ahead now at the end of the current
channel,
just beyond a coaster ca-
reened over in dry dock, was - rarity of
rarities - a wharf with an empty moor-
age. “How did we get so lucky?” Shaa
murmured. Ships were already being
forced to dock two and even three to
an anchorage, tying themselves side to
side out into the navigation channels.
“Steady as she goes, there,” said Cap-
tain Luff. He pointed with the stem of
his pipe. “Painted on that warehouse
wall, can you see it? The Dooglas com-
pany crest.
With the compensation
for that Dooglas business we’ll be re-

painting that, don’t you know; Halssen
Traders it’ll be now.”
Aye, thought Shaa, and here they
were indeed, heading in to the dock
all open and aboveboard, hiding be-
hind no clever incognito, their identity
free and plain to the world. Now they
would see if the game was once again
afoot, whether Shaa’s ﬁnal discussion
with the Creeping Sword before he’d
gone over the side had predicted actual
events.
Had someone been trailing
the ship? Was someone watching the
docks?
Well, even the Sword’s god friends -
or perhaps especially the Sword’s god
friends - weren’t omnipotent or om-
niscient; if watchers there were, the
Sword might have very well succeeded
in giving them the slip. Of course, it
might still be up to Shaa to complete
the job.

“Who are those people on the dock?”
asked Karlini.
While Shaa had been consumed with
his musing, he realized that a small
throng had gathered around him on
the deck. “You see that person stand-
ing alone off there on the right?” Roni
said, shielding her eyes with a hand.
“It’s been a long time, but ... yes! It’s
Dalya!”
“Dalya Hazeel?” said Karlini. “What’s
she doing here?”
“She must have gotten my message.”
“Your message? What message?”
“While the rest of you big-time plot-
ters were planning what to do in Peri-
dol,” Roni told him, “none of you both-
ered to think about where we were go-
ing to stay.”
“I ﬁgured we’d just come into town
and rent some rooms or something; the
usual.”

“You ﬁgured that, did you.
Dear.
With the ﬁrst Knitting in years going
on, probably the biggest one in history,
people streaming in from every corner
of the world, on top of all the people
heading into Peridol anyway looking
for work, you were just planning to
waltz in off the street and take lodg-
ings. Right, dear. If I left it up to you
we’d all be sleeping in a gutter, if we
were lucky.”
“Oh,” said Karlini.
“Well.
Thanks
then, dear.
Dalya, you say.
Huh.”
The seagull on his shoulder screeched
once for good measure, then looked up
at the sky.
With a matching wail,
a smaller gull with a brown back
swooped down from the ﬂock wheeling
overhead, ﬂuffed its wings just short
of Karlini’s hair, and dropped to a neat
landing on Karlini’s other shoulder.
Squirming crosswise in its beak was

a ﬁsh: a sardine, perhaps, or a small
herring.
Leaning around the back of
Karlini’s neck, the visitor presented its
gift to the ﬁrst gull, which took it with
a quick dart-and-snap and a backward
ﬂip of the head. The ﬁrst gull nodded
its head in apparent satisfaction, upon
which the visitor screeched once more,
sprang into the air, and ﬂapped away.
Karlini had seemingly ignored the
whole affair.
Even Shaa’s attention
had remained ﬁxed on the approach-
ing dock.
Tildamire Mont wanted to
ask who Dalya Hazeel was, anyway,
but from the look of things she thought
it might be better to keep it for later.
Maybe Haddo would know, or Wroclaw;
they seemed on top of most everything.
“What about those other people?” she
asked instead. “Those two on the other
end of the wharf, beyond the longshore-
men?”

The
pair
in
question
were
now
clearly visible as a man and a woman.
The woman was taller than the man,
and
wore
some
kind
of
headband
around her forehead that glinted in
the sun as her dark hair fell across it.
The man had on the casual day-wear of
the Peridol upper crust: white slacks,
a light jacket of bright green, and a
straw boater.
In spite of his sporty
outﬁt, although perhaps because of its
slightly rumpled appearance, the man
looked, in a word, tweedy.
Shaa was searching his memory.
What exactly had the Sword told him?
He
had
mentioned
two
gods
with
whom he’d interacted, in addition to
Gashanatantra; a woman and a man.
A “tweedy” man?
Yes, Shaa thought,
just so.
The Sword had clearly been
feeling his way through his discussion
with Shaa, trying to decide where the

balance point rested between keeping
to himself information he wasn’t sure
he wanted to share and continuing
to manage his balancing act solo.
It
was plain that the Sword knew more
about these gods than he was prepared
to let on.
While the general rule of
thumb was that the more dope you
had on a god the better off you’d be,
Shaa had been willing to let it ride.
Who knew where this tête-à-tête with
the Sword might lead, for one.
For
another, if he encountered the Sword’s
gods, Shaa, being his own prudent self,
would never approach them, of course.
At this moment, though, Shaa was
considering whether adherence to con-
ventional wisdom wasn’t exactly his
major problem.
First things ﬁrst, however. The Not
Unreasonable Proﬁt neatly edged into
its moorage. Lines were tossed and se-

cured, the gangplank was brought and
placed.
Captain Luff strode ashore
with the logbooks and turned aside
to present their papers to the local
dock master. Shaa followed him across
the gangplank, spent a short moment
perched on the end of the ramp con-
sidering the wharf beyond, and then
stepped over the edge.
He was now
ofﬁcially in Peridol; he was committed.
If the curse held true, he would not
be leaving again.
Nevertheless, when no electric shock
traveled up from the boards to fry
his body;
when the wharf termites
failed to spring into frantic activity
and cause the circle of wood he be-
strode to collapse, precipitating him
into the noxious pollution of the harbor
water; when his heart, though accel-
erated by the excitement, nonetheless
continued to beat; when, in fact, no

one else on the dock paid him more
than a passing glance of interest, Shaa
realized his mood had suddenly and
disproportionately lightened.
Curses
being what they were, none of these di-
vergent possibilities had been entirely
out of the question. He found himself
approaching, with a conﬁdent step, the
man and woman at the side of the
wharf.
The two of them had been examin-
ing the ship; now, as Shaa approached,
their scrutiny turned to him.
Shaa
executed a small, formally correct bow,
and addressed them.
“You appear to
be awaiting the arrival of this ship. Is
there some matter I might assist you
with? A bill of lading perhaps, or is it
that you bear a competitive bid for our
cargo? I am not, as you see, the cap-
tain, but I am empowered to proceed
with business nonetheless.”

The pair were both regarding him
minutely, and not only with their eyes,
either.
Shaa could feel the resonant
tingle of an aural probe, and a large
churning spot traveling across his body
in line with the woman’s gaze. “Well?”
said the man, but not to Shaa.
“I’d know him anywhere,” said the
woman, “but that’s not him.
I can’t
feel him on the ship, either. We could
take this one apart; see if he knows
anything, whoever he is.”
The man’s face was no longer frown-
ing, or even neutral, but now instead
bore an expression of dawning aston-
ishment.
He reached into his jacket,
withdrew a slate of platinum-colored
ceramic, and perused it, jabbing at
the thing with a ﬁnger while it made
low beeping sounds at him.
When
he looked back up a nasty smirk was
breaking through behind the amaze-

ment.
“You may not know this man,
but I do. Oh yes, I certainly do. You
are Zalzyn Shaa, the Cursed, aren’t
you?”
“That’s not exactly the way I’d prefer
to put it if you’d like to know the truth,”
said Shaa, “but in root of fact, yes. May
I help you?”
“Zalzyn Shaa,” the god said, “and in
Peridol. To meet his doom.”
“Yes, well, there are dooms and there
are dooms,” Shaa stated. “Foreordina-
tion often exhibits more mutability
than you might except.”
The god stretched out his hand,
opened it, examined the palm, then
clenched his ﬁst deliberately.
“You
might expect changefulness; I expect
none.
Artistic leeway in implementa-
tion, surely, but in the ﬁnal outcome?
No, certainly not.”
“Don’t get sidetracked,” the woman

told him.
‘We still haven’t found out
what happened to my husband.”
“Mr. Shaa will tell us what we want
to know. Won’t you, Mr. Shaa?”
“As long as we’re standing on cere-
mony,” said Shaa, “may I remind you
that ‘Doctor’ is the appropriate hon-
oriﬁc?
Shall we say this is one for
mutability, hmm?”
Shaa felt the heat of the god’s scrutiny
break on him like the force of a desert
sun at noontime. “I shall enjoy this,”
the god concluded after a moment. “I
ﬁnd I don’t like you.” He reached out
again with his hand and extended
the foreﬁnger. Shaa watched it come
with an abstract fascination, remem-
bering his histrionics on the ship, lan-
guid and frozen now that the moment
might have truly arrived. The ﬁngertip
nudged against Shaa’s shirt.
His trance suddenly shattered, Shaa’s

head went back and his spine arched,
his teeth clenched in a rictus snarl,
his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed
rigidly to the deck of the wharf, his
limbs jerking spasmodically.
“My,” the woman said to her com-
panion, “how powerful you are.
So
powerful that you render someone we
were about to interrogate incapable
of speech, and so surreptitiously, too.
Pick him up, why don’t you, so we can
at least take him with us.”
The god was examining his ﬁnger,
his lips pursed. “No,” he said. “There
are regulations.
I may not actually
take this one into my possession. No
matter; we will ﬁnd your husband re-
gardless. Here comes another one from
the ship. We can take him.”
“You’ve already caused too much
of a scene,” the woman said disgust-
edly.
“This new one on the way has

stand-off power, too, can’t you feel it?
We’ll have to come back for them when
they’re not on guard.” She raised her
arm, made a blade of her hand, and
slashed viciously down.
Behind her
arm the air blurred like the surface
of a pond under a thrown stone. The
area of disturbance rippled concentri-
cally outward, making the ﬁgures of
the two gods distort and break apart
behind it. Then, as the air stilled, it
became obvious that the two gods had
vanished.
Or had they vanished, per se? Two
rippling shadows moved quickly down
the dock and disappeared around the
corner of the Dooglas warehouse. Shaa
continued to writhe on the ground
as Karlini reached him.
“They’re
gone,” Karlini announced.
“Weren’t
you watching the refractive edge of the
misdirection ﬁeld?”

Shaa abruptly ceased his writhing
and straightened himself out on the
boards. “It is more difﬁcult than you
might think to keep your gaze aligned
when your eyeballs are rolling, espe-
cially when they are out of synchrony.”
Karlini squatted down next to him
as Shaa pulled himself to a sitting po-
sition. “Did he hurt you at all?”
They both looked down at the round
scorch mark on Shaa’s shirt. “A shock,”
Shaa acknowledged.
“I threw myself
away before it had a chance to general-
ize. A love-tap, you might say, at least
comparatively speaking.”
“I hope Roni never tries to love me
like that,” said Karlini.
“So, are you
planning to tell me what this was
all about?
Did you feed them one
of your song-and-dance numbers and
they didn’t like it?
What made you
take these guys on, anyway?”

Shaa looked past the now-smooth air
at the corner where the gods had disap-
peared. “You know, old friend,” he said
slowly, “that may just have been a sig-
niﬁcant mistake.”
“Your brother?” said Karlini.
“Yes,” Shaa said, “and no.
An en-
counter at second-hand, from a not
altogether expected quarter.
“Gods?”
“Evidently.” And not just any gods,
either.
Shaa didn’t know who the
woman was, but he now had an all-
to-solid suspicion of the identity of the
man.
This left no doubt that the Creeping
Sword hadn’t been overreacting when
he’d decided he needed help, and had
come to Shaa. In retrospect, it would
have been nice if the Sword had seen
ﬁt to give Shaa just a little more in-
formation, like who his friends were.

Presumably the Sword knew who they
were. Whether he knew or not, though,
didn’t address the immediate question.
Just what was the Sword doing tan-
gled up with Jardin, the Curse Admin-
istrator, anyway?

Chapter7
“WAIT
A
MINUTE,”
said
Jurtan
Mont. “Isn’t Peridol that way?”
They had reached a crossroads; Ju-
rtan, Max, and the remaining horse
with their baggage.
The east-west
thoroughfare
they’d
been
following
had grown wider. It had sprouted pave-
ment as well; clearly it had become
an artery of some stature.
Not only
that, it had trafﬁc, both foot and cart.
Most of the trafﬁc had been heading

in the same direction, west.
There
was no surprise about that. The post
at the corner of the intersection was
dominated by a large arrow-edged sign
pointing west,
labeled with “PERI-
DOL” in half-a-dozen forms of script.
No, there wasn’t much doubt about it,
not at all; Peridol was that way.
And it was almost in reach. Jurtan
could smell the sea air. Less than an
hour ago they’d even been visited by a
ﬂock of seabirds, virtually still damp,
which had wheeled overhead brieﬂy
before screeching their way again west
toward the ocean. If Max got a move
on, they could probably reach Peridol
while it was still day. The thought of
not having to get up at the crack of
dawn to climb on a horse ever again
was almost unbearably appealing.
As cryptic as Max was, there was
also little doubt that Peridol was their

destination.
It had been dangling in
front of Jurtan like a strung-up carrot
ever since Roosing Oolvaya, lost now
in the distant pages of memory. Max
couldn’t weasel out on him now.
But then, this was Max under dis-
cussion. And why else would he have
turned
aside
onto
the
north
road,
which was little more than a carriage-
track, really, and be standing there
with his hands on his hips glaring at
Jurtan with one of his, well, glares?
“Yeah, that’s right,” Max said.
“Uh,” said Jurtan, “can we get to
Peridol by heading north here?”
“Not unless we hire a boat.”
“Are we going to hire a boat?”
“Why would we do a thing like that?”
“So we can get – to - Peridol!”
“Get a grip on yourself, kid,” said
Max.
“We’ve got a little detour to
make, that’s all.”

Jurtan looked north along the trail.
He couldn’t see a swamp this time, but
that was scarcely reassuring.
“How about I meet you in the city?”
Jurtan said.
That’s what he said,
but still he found himself trudging
off the main road onto the path af-
ter Max.
Whenever Jurtan pointed
himself north, his mental accompani-
ment did switch to something bouncy
and upbeat, full of resolving major
chords and an oom-pah-ing tuba off
somewhere in the back, while even a
glance west caused the music to modu-
late into something weaker and irreso-
lutely drifting, but Jurtan was getting
pretty tired of a personal oracle that
thought it knew what was good for him
better than he did himself. Still, how
bad could it be?
“Don’t say that,” Jurtan muttered to
himself.

At least the place they were aiming
at this time had a name, according to
the north-facing panel on the signpost.
“What’s Yenemsvelt, anyway?” asked
Jurtan.
“The estate’s just the other side of
Yenemsvelt, actually,” Max told him.
The ‘estate’?
Well, that sounded
hopeful. “Is this estate in a swamp?”
Max spared him a quick glower.
“First thing we do after this stop is
get into the city and ﬁnd accommoda-
tions, all right?”
“I thought we were going to link up
with Shaa and the others.”
“Linking doesn’t mean we’re going to
stay with them. Maybe, but not neces-
sarily. Shaa’s probably already headed
off on his own in any case. He grew up
out here, you know.”
It was news to Jurtan. “Right,” he
said. “He hasn’t been back, though.”

“Not since his father died,” said Max.
His lips pursed in thought.
“Maybe
it’s time you heard a little more about
that.”
But that was the last Max said on
the subject, or on any other subject,
for that matter.
They trudged north,
the riderless horse behaving the most
energetically of any of them.
The
town of Yenemsvelt soon appeared,
consisting of a somewhat ramshackle
half-timbered tavern, a small market
square, an ecumenical multi-purpose
worship-building at least as tumble-
down as the tavern, and the usual
assortment of tradespersons with their
mixed-use
dwellings
and
business
establishments.
Max took a left at
the square and followed the carriage-
track out between the buildings into
the midst of rolling hills.
Thick and
bramble-ridden hedgerows lined the

verge of the road, broken occasionally
by stone walls and imposing iron gates.
They clattered over a small stream on
a sturdy open bridge.
Looking over
the side of the bridge into a pool just
downstream, Jurtan saw a trout leap
free of the water and ﬂop back down
with a good-sized splash. “Nice area, is
this?” Jurtan said.
“You ﬁgure it better be, if the Peridol
upper-crusters want to use it for their
out-of-town playground.”
Jurtan was seized by a suddenly hor-
rible suspicion. “You’re not planning to
rob one of them, are you?” he hissed.
There had been noises behind some
of the walls they’d passed, the kind of
noises something large might make if
it hadn’t been fed in a week.
“What do you take me for?” Max
sniffed.
“Oh,” said Jurtan.
“That’s good.
I

mean, some of those walls ...”
“It’s the ones without walls you re-
ally want to watch out for,” Max said
distractedly. “Now if I remember right,
it should be just over this rise.”
Sure enough, the straight stretch of
road beyond the top of the hill held
another gate, on the left.
Max in-
spected the gate. Instead of a sensible
lock-in-the-middle
hinge-on-the-sides
arrangement, what were visible were
an arrangement of eccentric cranks, a
windlass, and a large counterweight on
a lever arm. Not visible, however, was
anyone in the small watch-booth.
“Look,” said Jurtan, “a bell-cord -”
But Max was already up the side of
the wall, new ﬂoppy hat already look-
ing as worn as the one he’d left behind
in the pit, shaggy beard, and all, and
then he was swinging deftly over the
sharpened spikes at the top to vanish

down the other side. The howl of a wolf
sounded from just beyond the wall. Ju-
rtan grasped the horse’s bridle and pre-
pared to ﬂee.
The howl abruptly cut off, and was
replaced by an eager snufﬂing and
much rapid panting.
These sounds
were shortly drowned under the creak
and clatter of gearteeth and linkages.
The gate rumbled open. “What are you
waiting for?” said Max.
Jurtan
edged
cautiously
through
and peeked around the mechanism.
Max was feeding their last strips of
jerky to a small horse - no, it was
only a large hound.
An apparently
friendly hound, however.
When the
beast reared back to lick Max’s face,
Jurtan saw a second one lolling on the
ground behind it slavering onto Max’s
boot.
“All right, all right,” Max told
them.
“That’s enough.
Off with you

now.”
The dogs shook themselves off, licked
Max’s hands once more for good mea-
sure, and trotted away.
Away from
Max, at any rate.
“He’s got all the food,” Jurtan said
nervously.
One of them was almost
looking him in the eye, and it still
had all four feet on the ground.
The
other one was moving around to Ju-
rtan’s side to ﬂank him.
“Hey, stop
that.” He snatched his hand free of the
thing’s mouth. In return, he got a low
growl.
“Uh, you like music?” Jurtan
whistled the refrain of a hunting song
he’d heard at an inn on the road.
The hound let go of his jacket and
sprang back. Both of them edged away,
then turned and padded off into the
trees, casting glances back at him over
their shoulders.
Max had done something to the

mechanism, and the gate was now
closing behind them.
“I wish you
wouldn’t do things like this,” Jurtan
said.
“Someday you’re going to give
somebody heart failure.”
“Why make them come all the way
out here just to open the gate?”
“That’s not it,” said Jurtan, exam-
ining the gate mechanism himself. A
pull-rod ran from the gearbox into an
iron conduit and down into the ground.
“You can run this thing by remote
control, right?
If we’d rung the bell,
whoever’s on the other end could have
opened the gate without coming out
here.”
“Good eyes,” Max said.
“This way.
Bring the horse.”
The gate clanged shut as they started
up the long driveway. Past the belt of
trees inside the wall, they entered a se-
ries of rolling lawns. The drive crossed

another stream and then wound through
an expanse of formal gardens. A crew
of landskeepers far off to the left was
pruning a hedge maze. Ahead of them
on a rise,
though,
was the estate
house; classically proportioned, with
an abundance of colonnades and cor-
nices breaking up the off-white stone
facade.
They skirted a fountain sur-
rounded by a ﬂower bed in the middle
of the circular drive and Max mounted
the front stairs. His yank on the bell-
pull brought a mufﬂed clanging of
chimes from within.
After a moment, the door swung
open. “Ah,” said the footman. His gaze
traveled down and then up as he took
in Max’s travel-beaten outﬁt, bushy
black beard, slouch hat, and gener-
ally unrecognizable yet unmistakably
disreputable demeanor. “Master Max-
imillian, sir, won’t you come in? We’ve

been expecting you.”
Jurtan left the horse with a groom
who had scurried up with just that pur-
pose in mind and followed Max into the
entry hall. “Cleeve, isn’t it?” Max was
saying. “Did you recognize me by sight
just now?”
“Purely circumstantial, sir,” Cleeve
assured him. “You are indeed a person
of
indecipherable
appearance
unex-
pectedly presenting themselves fresh
from the road; merely a matter of con-
text, what.
Would you care for some
refreshment?”
Yes!
Jurtan thought.
But instead,
Max said, “Is she around?”
“In the gardens, sir. The oaks.”
“Good,” Max said. “I’ll see her ﬁrst.
You can take my friend off and get him
fed, though.”
“I’ll wait, too,” inserted Jurtan. “Why
don’t we both see ‘her’ ﬁrst?”

“I - oh, all right, come on then.”
Cleeve led them out through a plant-
ﬁlled conservatory and out the back
onto a spacious piazza.
A ﬂight of
stairs took them down from the ter-
race onto another lawn.
The lawn
backed up against a sizable pond, com-
plete with ducks, but its side mar-
gins were lined with neat rows of oak
trees.
“Third back on the left when
last sighted, sir,” said Cleeve, before in-
clining his head politely and retreating
back up the stairs.
Beneath the third oak on the left was
a lawn chair, and next to it a picnic bas-
ket and a bulging gunny sack.
“Did
‘she’ wander off?” said Jurtan, looking
behind the tree.
They’d seen no evi-
dence of anyone about on their stroll
out from the terrace.
“It’s me,” Max called out, “I’m here!
You waiting for me to come up there af-

ter you?”
Foliage rustled overhead.
Leaves
parted and a dirty face appeared, up-
side down and craned back.
“It took
you long enough,” the face said, and
only then did Jurtan realize the person
was a woman. “What was it this time,
another swamp?”
“As a matter of fact, yes,” Max said,
his own head canted back and his
hands on his hips, “there was a swamp.
I told you there’d be a swamp.”
“He never could resist a swamp,”
the woman said to Jurtan.
“Must
have been some kind of deathmarch,
huh, Jurtan; all the way from Roosing
Oolvaya with this maniac? This is the
Mont kid, right?”
“You’re Eden!” Jurtan blurted. “Shaa’
sister!”
Eden looked Jurtan over, then turned
a frowning gaze on Max. “You haven’t

told him anything useful, have you?
Sometimes I don’t know why I bother
with you.” Eden’s face disappeared into
the branches.
It was replaced by a
line of rope, and then the full ﬁgure
of Eden, right-side-up now, descend-
ing rapidly hand-over-hand down it.
She was dressed in a leather climbing
outﬁt, another coil of rope slung over
her shoulder and a stout utility belt
bearing pitons and a hammer fastened
about her waist.
Eden dropped free
the last ten feet and landed next to the
lawn chair.
Jurtan shut his eyes and ran his
hand over his face. He hadn’t known
Zalzyn and Eden Shaa were twins. But
what else could they be? - they couldn’t
be just normal siblings, not when Eden
could have been Shaa with a little
padding here and there; even her voice
sounded the same, if in a higher regis-

ter, contralto to his baritone. But when
she had come down the rope she had
moved like Max.
A chair poked the back of Jurtan’s
knees and he sank gratefully back
into it.
Cleeve had returned with a
small party of servants bearing be-
tween them extra chairs, a buffet table,
several ﬂagons of mineral water, and a
fruit-and-cheese platter. Max ﬁnished
divesting himself of hat, beard, bushy
eyebrows, and nose putty while Eden,
her equipment stored back in the sack,
rinsed off her face in a basin. Cleeve
took the basin and withdrew. “Okay,”
Eden declared, “now we can say hello.”
Jurtan
hurriedly
transferred
his
melon plate to his other hand and wob-
bled to his feet for a bow. “I am Jurtan
Mont,” he conﬁrmed.
“A pleasure,” said Eden, grasping
his hand ﬁrmly for a vigorous shake.

When she let go Jurtan fell back into
his chair. Eden regarded him for a mo-
ment, then turned again on Max. Max
gave her a tentative hug and leaned in
for a peck on the cheek. She turned her
head and caught him on the lips, held
it for a beat, then wrinkled her nose
as he pulled back. “A bath,” she told
him, “deﬁnitely a bath. Then we can
decide if you’d like to seduce me.” Her
grin widened. “I don’t get many guests,
after all.”
“Idle ﬂirting,” Max said to no one in
particular, “that’s all it is.”
“How would you know?” said Eden.
“Would you be serious if I took you
seriously?” Max asked.
“You like intrigue so much, maybe
you can ﬁgure it out. Sit down and try
some of this stuff, it’s good; I’ve been
growing it in the back.”
“I’m
not
hungry,”
Max
told
her.

“What are you now, my mother?”
“I’m as close to it as you’ve ever
gotten,” said Eden, applying a slice of
cheddar to an apple wedge.
“When I
pulled you out of the gutter -”
“Not that again,” Max said, frown-
ing at his mineral water. “By the time
we met I hadn’t been in the gutter for
years, and as I recall you didn’t have
anything to do with me being in or
out.”
“I was speaking technically.”
Technically the statement was cor-
rect. “That wasn’t a gutter,” Max said,
“that was a sewer, and you may have
pulled me out of it physically, but
metaphorically -”
“You’re
getting
pretty
testy,
you
know that?”
“Never been a testy bone in my body,”
snapped Max. “What have you been up
to?”

“What do you think I’ve been up to?”
“Probably the usual, running half
the business of the western world.
What’s your latest triumph?”
“Houseplants.”
“Houseplants?”
“That’s right, houseplants,” Eden re-
peated.
She tossed her plate on the
table and leaned back. “Potted ferns,
ﬁcus, some succulents, the occasional
ﬂower bed.”
“You worked out a way to turn plants
and shrubbery into a cash crop?”
“They’re all the rage,” said Eden.
“All I had to do was get them into
the palace. The in-crowd latched onto
them, and now you can’t walk into an
ofﬁce or a bank anywhere in town with-
out falling over a planter box. Lucky
for you, I don’t mind telling you. Be-
tween you and Zolly spending money
hand over ﬁst it’s good somebody’s out

bringing in the bucks.”
Zolly? Zolly? “What about Groot?”
asked Jurtan.
“What about him?” said Eden.
“I thought Max was getting money
from Groot too.”
“You’re hanging out with a crew with
expensive tastes,” Eden told him.
“Am I?” Jurtan said. “It’s hard to tell
when you’re walking all day and then
sleeping in the mud.”
“You want out, kid?” said Max. “You
know where the door is.”
I can be subtle, Jurtan thought, or I
can just go for it. But what do I have
to lose? “I still don’t know what I’d be
getting out from,” Jurtan stated, try-
ing to keep his voice ﬁrm and reason-
able, and not at all whiny. “How can
I know what I’d be getting out of if I
don’t really know what I’ve gotten into?
All any of you ever want to do is drop

sneaky little hints.”
“He’s got you there, Max,” Eden said.
“You want him to know something?”
said Max. “You think he’s ready to be
a full-ﬂedged member? Then you tell it
to him.”
“Still being touchy, are we?
Okay,
then, I will.”
Max h’mphed and looked up into the
tree.
“There’s actually not much I can tell
you,” Eden went on. “There’s me and
Zolly, and Arznaak too of course, but
that much I’m sure you already know.
You don’t? Well, okay then.”
“Just the high points,” Max broke
in. “I still want to make it into the city
today, and there’s stuff we need to go
over.”
“Have you seen the roads? They say
trafﬁc’s a total mess, the Tongue’s com-
pletely jammed, and the water’s even

worse.”
“If the worst I ever have to face is
trafﬁc congestion I’d look forward to a
long and pleasant life,” Max said dryly.
“Don’t you have anything to drink in
this place beside spring water?”
Eden raised her hand and waved at
the house. Cleeve appeared at the top
of the stairs and hurried toward them.
More distractions, Jurtan thought. It
was going to be the same as always.
They’d sit here for awhile, never actu-
ally getting to the point, and then if
they ﬁnally did start to reach any sig-
niﬁcant revelations something would
tunnel out of the ground to attack
them, or the tree would fall over, or
somebody would come running up with
an urgent message.
The possibilities
were endless; these people were cre-
ative, after all.
The bottom line was
that Jurtan would still be left knowing

nothing new.
Or would he?
There were certain
new facts at hand, Jurtan realized.
What could he deduce from them?
Cleeve took Max’s order, for “some-
thing brewed, anything, and I don’t
mean tea,” and scurried off again.
When he had retreated, Jurtan said
slowly, still thinking it out, “Shaa’s not
the only one with a curse, is he? Eden
- you’re part of it too, aren’t you? Shaa
can go wherever he wants except home,
but home’s the place you can’t leave.”
“Did you tell him or is he ﬁguring
this out?” Eden asked Max.
Max had leaned back in his chair
and propped his hat over his face in
conspicuous
preparation
for
a
nap.
From under the hat, though, he spoke.
“It’s the kid’s own reasoning, if you
want to glorify it by calling it that.
Maybe he hasn’t been asleep all the

time.”
“Has Max always been like this?” Ju-
rtan wondered.
“As long as I’ve known him,” Eden
said. “Do you want to hear about that,
or about me and the family?”
“The family,” said Jurtan, “please.”
The “high points” account, as Max
would have it, was much as Jurtan had
begun to piece together.
Punctuated
by Max’s sarcastic asides, and keep-
ing in mind the fact that Eden might
not be the most reliable of witnesses
on the subject, the story of the Shaas
was still well in keeping with all Ju-
rtan had heard about the byzantine
and fratricidal ways of Peridol society.
The Shaa family had been prominent
in Gadzura for several generations;
according to Max, long enough for in-
breeding to have apparently had some
impact.
Eden and Zalzyn Shaa had

their eccentricities, but Arznaak, the
ﬁrst-born, had a far more intimate re-
lationship with the borderland of san-
ity. As far back as Eden could recall,
Arznaak had been either wonderful
or miserable to be around, with little
ground in between.
“It’s hard to believe unless you’ve
seen him in operation,” Eden said, “but
even I’ll admit he can be quite charm-
ing, full of expansive good humor and
ﬂamboyant gestures, great laughter
and so forth, but it’s not an act, it’s re-
ally genuine. The problem is his other
side.
That’s genuine too.
He’ll shift
modes in the middle of a sentence, the
middle of a thought.”
More often, though, the elements
of
Arznaak’s
personality
wouldn’t
switch so much as merge. For a time
when Eden had been quite young, the
older Arznaak had taken to giving her

presents. He had given her a doll, for
example, which several days later had
begun to writhe on her bed until its
skin burst, the stufﬁng having been
consumed from within by maggots. In
replacement, she had returned to her
room after being calmed from her ﬁt of
hysterics to ﬁnd, dressed in the doll’s
fashionable clothing, a large glassy-
eyed rat. But then Arznaak had been
so contrite and winsome afterward, at
least publicly, that it was difﬁcult to
do anything but wonder whether the
incident had happened at all.
Arznaak had not wondered, he had
learned. The ﬁrst conclusions he had
drawn had concerned the need for se-
crecy and craft, the behind-the-scenes
jab and the terror in the night. Each
of the Shaas had their talents, and
these had turned out to be Arznaak’s.
As Arznaak’s skill at familial terror-

ism increased, the twins’ relationship
was deepened by their instinct to hang
together, which in turn fed Arznaak’s
own tendencies. “Whether he started
off just toying with us or not,” said
Eden, “eventually he got to where he
resented us for living. Then he started
to get really nasty.”
“What about your parents?” Jurtan
asked.
Max snorted.
“Shut up,” Eden in-
structed him. “I’m telling this.”
Max pulled the hat off his face, sat
up, and addressed Jurtan.
“The fact
that their father had been totally de-
voted to Arznaak and was never partic-
ularly interested in the twins gave Arz-
naak the perfect way to extend his non-
sense permanently through their lives.
Both of them are too pigheaded to ad-
mit it, but all that means is that they
got it from their father in the ﬁrst place.

Half of this was his fault but none of
them want to do a damn thing about
it.”
Eden sighed. “We go over this every
time we get together, Max,” she said.
“You want to waste the time all over
again?”
“Damn fools,” Max grumbled, but
he scrunched down in his chair and
mashed his hat once more back over
his face.
“Okay,” said Eden. For someone Max
was calling pigheaded, Jurtan thought
she sounded pretty objective about the
whole thing.
Beﬁtting the family’s
rank and station in Peridol’s economy
and society, the Shaas had received
the best education and training. This
had fallen on fertile ground. Eden and
Zalzyn showed widespread and over-
lapping natural talents, but each had
gravitated toward different interests.

Zalzyn’s high aptitude for magic and
math along with the Shaas’ favorable
family connections had promised a bril-
liant career, conceivably culminating
as the head of the Imperial Institute
of Thaumaturgy.
Eden, on the other
hand, had the makings of a signif-
icant politician and businessperson.
Arznaak? Well, Arznaak had the apti-
tudes too, but to Eden it had been clear
he wanted more.
“The throne?” asked Jurtan.
“It wouldn’t surprise me for a minute,
Eden stated.
But whatever Arznaak
wanted, he wanted it his way.
“The Shaas are a creative lot,” said
Max.
He took another swig from
the brew Cleeve had passed to him.
“Arznaak’s just nastier than the rest.
Hurry it up, the kid and I have to get
moving.”
“What a guy,” said Eden. “You show

up every ﬁve years and the ﬁrst thing
you want to do is leave.”
“You didn’t have to let me in.”
“Next time you’d better watch out for
the alarm. So, Jurtan Mont, now you
know the story.”
I do? thought Jurtan. No I don’t, not
all of it anyway. Maybe it was another
test.
“Arznaak wanted to take away what-
ever you liked most, is that it?
You
can’t leave this estate, Shaa can’t come
back to it, the only time the two of you
can get together at all is when he uses
magic and you’re forced to attack him?
He can’t practice magic and you can’t
be out where you can do business or
politics.” What else had he heard from
Shaa? “Neither one of you can ﬁnd love,
either, can you.”
Eden regarded Max with a sidelong
glance, which he acknowledged only by

increasing the intensity of his stare off
into the distance. “Sure we can,” said
Eden. “All we have to do is follow the
rules.”
“So why not just get rid of Arznaak?
I mean, you hate him by now, don’t
you?”
“It’s not that simple.”
“What my good friend is referring
to there,” Max broke in, “is wily old
Arznaak’s coup de grace twist-of-the-
knife. As Arznaak knows full well, his
siblings bind themselves by rules he
doesn’t even bother to sneer at.”
Eden sat with her arms crossed and
her face locked in a scowl, saying noth-
ing. “‘He’s the only one of you worth a
second glance,’” Max continued, “isn’t
that what he said? The last words of
your beloved father?”
“An oath is an oath,” said Eden in a
low voice, her teeth gritted.

“What your mentor’s sister is trying
not to tell you here,” Max said to Jur-
tan in a conversational tone, “is that
Arznaak’s curse keyed off the death
of their father, the same father who
thought Arznaak was the gods’ own
gift to the mortal world, the same fa-
ther who made Eden and Shaa swear
to support good old Arznaak and keep
him safe from harm. Old Pops wanted
to make sure they wouldn’t attack
their brother or even let anyone else go
after him, and he was such a wise old
guy and was so good to them all that -”
“That’s enough, Max,” said Eden.
“You want enough? I’ll tell you what
enough is.
I’m out there year after
year breaking my back trying to ﬁnd a
loophole through your curse or a way
around it because neither one of you
fools want to let me solve the problem
at the root. Damn Peridol and its god-

damned code of honor, and damn all
-”
“Are you ﬁnished?”
“No, I’m not ﬁnished, I -”
“Then just shut up, why don’t you,”
Eden snapped. “Nobody’s forcing you
to help us. If you can’t do things the
way we have to do them, we don’t want
your help.”
“Pretty big words,” said Max. “I don’t
think your brother would agree.”
“I think he would. I may not be able
to talk to him but that doesn’t mean I
don’t still know the way he thinks. You
follow our code or get out of our lives.”
“Don’t give me that nonsense -”
“Then get out of my house.”
Max cursed under his breath. “You’re
stubborn as ever. You don’t leave me
much maneuver room.”
“That’s the idea.”
“Fine,” said Max. “So that’s the way

you want it. I’ll think about it.”
“Think fast.”
“... All right, already, all right.”
“Swear.”
Max looked thoroughly disgusted.
“I’ve sworn before, dammit. All right,
I swear again, I’ll do things your way.
Are you happy?
Now let me out of
here.”
“What,” said Eden, “with no situ-
ation update, no coordination?
You
mean this was just a social call, just
because you were in the neighborhood?
I’m ﬂattered.
There must be a ﬁrst
time for everything.”
“The world would be a lot simpler if
your brother was an only child,” Max
muttered.
“Either one of them.
All
right, let’s coordinate, why don’t we.”
Eden’s face conspicuously fell, ex-
cept for a sardonic twist that remained
in the corner of her mouth.
Jurtan

had seen exactly the same expression
before, on Zalzyn Shaa. Seeing it here,
on her, was weird, but compared to the
other items on the local scale of eccen-
tricity you had to admit it was pretty
far down. “So much for the dream of so-
ciability,” Eden said. “In time perhaps
I will get over the wound.
The most
recent update concerns the arrival of
my brother and the boat this morn-
ing. Zolly had some kind of run-in at
the dock, I don’t have details on it yet.
He’ll be staying at his city house.”
“And Arznaak?”
Eden shrugged.
“He’s around.
He
was out here last week but he’s really
living in town now.”
“I brought some papers out of the
swamp I want to show you while I’m
here. Why don’t we head back to the
house?”
Jurtan fell in to his accustomed po-

sition, trailing Max as they strolled
up the lawn toward the estate house.
Eden and Max were speaking together
in low voices ahead of him, but even
if they had been talking in a normal
voice and addressing Jurtan directly
he wasn’t certain he’d have heard any-
thing they said. He had too much on
his mind as it was. In fact, they were in
the house with the Iskendarian papers
spread out before them on a table, and
Jurtan had a largely devoured plate of
chicken at his elbow, before he began to
pay attention again to what was going
on around him.
“I don’t know,” Eden was saying,
shufﬂing papers back into a stack.
“See what Zolly has to say; he’s the real
scholar in the family anyway. Wait a
minute - you should talk to some of the
old-line religionists, too.
They claim
to trace their lineage back before the

Dislocation; they probably have a lot of
old-language stuff hidden away.”
“Huh,” said Max.
“An interesting
idea.
Which group are you thinking
about, the One God cultists or the God
is Everywhere gang?”
“The family has some contacts with
the One God people,” Eden said.
“One God?” said Jurtan.
“Who in
their right mind would believe in only
one god?”
“Some of us don’t believe in any,”
Max observed.
“These cultists have a more tran-
scendental
perspective,”
explained
Eden. “They feel that the rough-and-
tumble present-day polytheism gets in
the way of confronting the real issues
of the divine.”
“If a gang of super-powered hooli-
gans are in your face all the time it’s
difﬁcult to get clear of the image they

create,” Max added. “The old-line cults
think gods should be more exemplary
than obviously out for their own good.
More primal. As you’d imagine, there
aren’t a whole lot of these cult folks
left.”
“If they might know something, why
haven’t you gotten together with them
before now?” said Jurtan.
“I’m only one person,” said Max.
“I’ve got limits.”
“Let me go talk to them, then,” Ju-
rtan said. “Tell me what you want to
know and where to ﬁnd them and I’ll
do it.”
Max looked at Jurtan, and a queru-
lous clarinet trilled in the back of Jur-
tan’s head. “You mean try to get some
useful contribution out of you?” Max
said. “Maybe. But there’s something
else I want to try with you ﬁrst.”
Jurtan didn’t know whether he liked

the sound of that. He didn’t like the
present state of affairs either, though,
and he had to acknowledge that he
couldn’t
easily
have
it
both
ways.
“Whatever you say,” he said. “Let me
know.”

Chapter8
IF NOTHING ELSE, I thought I
might be getting more efﬁcient.
To
have the mystery of my dream present
itself and almost immediately get re-
solved, at the same time introducing
new questions of an increased level of
urgency, opened new horizons of com-
petence and high performance. There
was no denying it had been efﬁcient:
all I’d had to do to pierce Joatal Bal-
lista’s disguise and realize he was re-

ally Fradjikan was to show up. I was
supposed to be a detective, after all,
but maybe my real contribution to the
ﬁeld was going to rest in ﬁguring out
how to eliminate legwork, substituting
for it pure reason or the power of mind.
Of course, I may have now known
that Ballista was Fradjikan, but I still
didn’t have any idea who Fradjikan
was and why he might be important.
About my traveling companion I’d
discovered practically nothing.
Of
course, he could probably say the same
thing about me. In fact, as the miles
had gone past under the wheels of the
carriage the man who called himself
Ballista had begun looking more than
a little disgruntled. I knew I couldn’t
have given him much of anything to
work on concerning me. The fact that
he clearly was working on me, however,
did make the situation more interest-

ing, as if it really needed that. It was
possible he was just some operator
who never got out of bed in the morn-
ing without pulling on his cloak of
suspicion, and was as a result merely
keeping his hand in. It was possible,
and if it was in fact the case then I’d be
out nothing but a little time and effort
spent worrying about him and wonder-
ing what he was up to, and trying to
pierce his secrets. The same would be
true of him.
Unless the same wasn’t true of him,
which was plainly the safe way to
bet. After all, I had spent my solitary
dream to date visualizing him.
That
had to be good for something. Add to
that the experience of last night, too.
There had been no particular reason
for Ballista to insist on stopping at
the tavern and laying over to morning
when we had been in sight of the lights

of Peridol. His excuse concerning the
danger of pressing into the city at
night, what with the streets crowded
with ne’er-do-wells, dangerous sorts
from the hinterlands and the rough
sections of town, and, well, crowds
in general, was out of keeping with
his forcefully projected self-image as a
fear-nothing man-of-arms. The added
fact that once ensconced in the tavern
he had done his best to ply me with
drink, an effort I had cooperated with
more than not, to such an extent that
even now, midway through the next
morning, my memory was still patchy
and my consciousness skipping in and
out, implied... implied ...
Where was I? Oh, right. He was try-
ing to ﬁnd out who I was and what I
knew. Whatever I knew or didn’t know,
I had certainly done the same thing of-
ten enough in my own work to recog-

nize it when it was aimed at me.
That apparently hadn’t been the
only reason for last night’s stop, though.
Through the haze of spotty memory, I
did remember a time when Lowell, the
driver, had come in from the yard to
nod pointedly at Ballista, followed a
few minutes later by Ballista slipping
outside himself when he thought I
had passed out on top of the table. I
hadn’t passed out, though, at least not
that time, and so I remembered him
reentering the common-room ﬁfteen
minutes or so later, allowing himself
an expression of satisfaction which
vanished as soon as I began to sput-
ter and stir. I would have crept after
him to observe his mission except that
Lowell had stayed behind to keep an
eye on me. That, and the fact that I
thought creeping might very well have
been beyond me at that point, given

the quantity of reactants I had already
consumed.
On his return Ballista had downed
a few too, although not enough to lay
him out, and not enough to loosen his
tongue, either.
I’d thought he might
let something slip when he thought
I was in no state to absorb it, but
that hope too went unfulﬁlled.
He
was being equally unforthcoming this
morning. For some reason he did seem
slightly more keyed-up, almost expec-
tant, and I caught him darting a few
sharp glances at me out of the cor-
ner of my eye when he thought I was
looking out the window or nursing my
headache. I actually wasn’t hung over,
not really, but I didn’t see any point in
telling him that.
If the truth be told, I really had been
more than half hoping for another
dream.
The ﬁrst one had taken the

trouble to point out Ballista/Fradjikan,
after all, so I thought it wasn’t unrea-
sonable to expect another hint, if not
outright elucidation. But no. I’d woken
with the residual feeling that whatever
had caused the ﬁrst dream was still
lurking around, its feelers hanging out
into the breeze, but was not yet ready
to reveal itself again.
It sounds ab-
surd to anthropomorphize the internal
workings of my own mind, I know, but
on the other hand whatever might be
hidden there was certainly uncharted
land. In any case, as much time as I’d
been spending lately in self-absorption,
there was coming to be even more to
pay attention to in the outside world.
During my years in Roosing Oolvaya,
which is to say during the only stretch
of memory my mind was willing to di-
vulge, I had left the city on a number
of occasions, and several times for ex-

tended periods.
I’d never made it to
Peridol, though. I’d seen a few other
cities, even brought a guy to ground
in Edgerton, which was the biggest
place anywhere at all close to Roos-
ing Oolvaya’s vicinity, but compared
to Peridol, any place I’d ever been was
no better than second rate.
Fact is,
compared to Peridol any place built by
man is no more than second rate.
It’s one thing to know that as ab-
stract
book-learning,
however,
and
another thing to see what it meant in
practice. The road outside the inn had
widened before we’d reached the tav-
ern the previous afternoon, and even
at night when we’d stopped there had
been enough trafﬁc to make it seem
busy.
This morning, though, Lowell
had had to virtually force his way out
of the gate and edge carefully into the
ﬂow. The sun had been up a few hours

by the time we’d left, too, so we’d even
missed the predawn and early morn-
ing peak inﬂux of farm-fresh goods
from the agricultural areas into the
city. Judging from the cargoes still on
the highway, however, it was apparent
the farm trade was a day-round affair.
Although we were fortunately out at
the wrong time to need to tangle with
sheep drivers, the cackle of chickens
and the ﬂapping of ﬁsh still fresh from
the sea was prominent around us. The
smell of the ﬁsh wasn’t the only aroma
rising in the morning sun, either. You
could have distilled a pretty hearty
stew from the odors alone, what with
a veritable fruit and vegetable cocktail
from the wagons - citrus, pears, mel-
ons; cabbage, onions, tomato; and the
occasional head of beef or straggling
lamb.
As we drove on at a crawl, unable to

break free of the knots of people on foot,
on horses, in carts, leading donkeys
and oxen, and jostling in carriages like
ours, the road continued to widen, but
the trafﬁc kept thickening even faster
than that.
Where yesterday we had
driven through towns and villages sep-
arated by stretches of countryside, this
morning the towns had grown larger
and the countryside more scarce, until
now we were for all intents within the
outskirts of Peridol itself.
Peridol as a whole wasn’t known for
its architecture; surely not, since so
much of it was a warren of overgrown
slums crowded with folks who’d headed
for the city looking for the streets of
gold. Not surprisingly, though, given
the business the road trafﬁc surely
generated, the area surrounding the
highway looked fairly prosperous. Be-
ﬁtting Peridol’s southerly location and

moderate, sunny climate, adobe and
stucco predominated, with an excess
of baked-tile roofs in shades of red
and orange. The walls and courtyards
were hung with banners and iconic
signs advertising the wares of the busi-
nesses within. Here and there too were
expanses of Peridol’s notorious broad-
sheets press-printed in rolls and rudely
plastered by roving glue-gangs on the
sides of anything vertical - houses, re-
taining walls, trees, parked carriages,
even across closed gates and the doors
and windows of houses.
While the
broadsheets themselves extolled the
virtues of shops and emporiums, soap
and ﬂea-powder, nostrums and ales
and patent horseshoes, emblematic of
the move toward group-production in
the new city manufactories, to me they
spoke as much of the restless energy
of people suppressed by the hand of

the gods, yet still searching like the
subterranean ﬁre of the volcano for an
outlet to the air.
As far as I knew, the gods hadn’t yet
made a ruling one way or the other on
Peridol’s emerging mercantilistic fer-
vor. Because of the gods’ sponsorship
of the empire and its rulers, and by
extension Peridol itself, the city was
enough of a special case to sometimes
get away with stuff that would be ﬂat-
tened in a moment anywhere else. City
dwellers like to push the edge of limits,
though, and Peridolians were the city
dwellers par excellence; just the sort
the gods I knew would enjoy taking
down. Still, if the gods were going to
lay down the law, it didn’t seem likely
they’d do it during a Knitting. Half the
point of a Knitting, after all, was its
element of let-loose free-for-all, when
normal restrictions didn’t necessarily

apply.
Not
all
of
that
assessment
was
purely analytical.
At least a bit was
due to out-and-out wishful thinking. If
something was going to break loose, I
was hoping it would wait until I’d left
town.
Of course, if I ran into any of my god
acquaintances I could ask them what
was up.
With the struggle going on
between the Abdicationists, those gods
who wanted to pull back and let the
world screw itself up to its heart’s con-
tent without interference from them,
and the Conservationists, who ﬁgured
they had such a good deal running it
would be crazy to change, it was pos-
sible that the transitions in Peridol
were part of the active debate.
That
much was speculation; I didn’t know
enough about the politics of the gods to
tell for certain. I’d only picked up the

fringes of the argument from Zhardann
and Jill, who were Conservationists of
some stripe, and I hadn’t gotten any
more than that from Gash, who prob-
ably didn’t have much more of a ﬁxed
ideology than unwavering support for
himself.
I’d probably learned more
from my brief exchange with Phlinn
Arol, who’d seemed surprisingly Abdi-
cationist in sentiment, than I had in
days around the others.
Whether I’d
learned enough to meddle remained
to be seen. Ballista had been wearing
an increasingly annoyed expression as
the carriage lurched along in its spas-
modic ﬁts and starts. Sliding open the
panel at the front of the cab, he leaned
through to commune with Lowell, try-
ing to convince him to lay about with
his whip.
Lowell, quite intelligently
I thought, had the opinion that the
crowd would be only too happy to vent

its own frustration by overturning the
vehicle and stomping it to splinters.
Ballista sank back into the cushions
and regarded me. “Your ﬁrst time in
Peridol?” he said.
“Aye, that it is.”
“Where will you go when we part?”
I shrugged.
“Fortune awaits.
For
that matter, perhaps I’ll just get out
here. From the looks of it I’d make at
least as a good a time on foot.”
“Afoot,” he said disgustedly.
“You
may be right. If Lowell -”
Just at that moment, though, Low-
ell spotted his opportunity, a smaller
side street winding in from the right.
He veered the horses through a small
knot of people balancing fagots of wood
on their heads, sending branches and
logs ﬂying, and hurtled straight for
the nearest wall.
The coach scraped
against the edge of a building just in

front of my window and caromed off,
but as the vehicle rocked sharply back
from the impact we were through the
crowd and into the alley. Hooves and
rattling wheels echoed back from the
close-set buildings. Winding a serpen-
tine path, people reeling against the
walls as we hurtled toward them, the
street led us to another, then another.
Just as I was about to wonder aloud
if Lowell had any idea where he was
going, the alley debouched into a wider
thoroughfare. The new avenue again
had trafﬁc, but this time a dedicated
lane for vehicles as well.
It wasn’t a street, it was a highway,
in fact the main highway pointed at
Peridol from the east. It was straight,
too. Up ahead, several miles away to
be sure, beyond the depressingly short
stretch where wheeled trafﬁc was mov-
ing forward at a solid pace, the road

lifted in a broad span; that had to be
one of the big Tongue Water bridges.
Beside me, Ballista snapped shut
a pocket-watch and stowed it away.
“Late for an appointment?” I asked.
“Possibly,” he said. Then he added,
apparently
as
an
afterthought,
“If
they know what’s good for them they’ll
wait.”
I turned back and looked out the
window.
I stared idly at the passing
crowds and houses for a moment, but
then when I glanced ahead again we
were almost at the bridge.
Huh? I thought. We couldn’t have
gone that far that quickly, especially
since the trafﬁc had once more ground
to a crawl. My bout with the brew of
the previous night must have affected
me more than I’d realized.
Anyway
you cut it, it was weird, though.
I’d
slipped out and back into conscious-

ness so smoothly I hadn’t even realized
I’d nodded off.
Unless it hadn’t been the aftereffect
of the liquor. What if brew hadn’t been
the only thing I’d consumed? What if
Fradjikan had slipped me some drug,
too?
It wouldn’t be the ﬁrst time for
me. I didn’t feel narcotized, but I had
enough experience in these things to
know that didn’t necessarily mean any-
thing. There were a lot of jungles out
there, and in the jungles no end of
herbs, shrubs, vegetables, trees, mush-
rooms, and assorted saprophytes just
oozing with pharmacoactive sap and
pollen, not to mention the legions of
beetles, insects, grubs, and other chem-
ical factories on the hoof. Folks spent
their careers hunting out and distilling
the stuff; there were guilds, dynasties,
societies and more freelancers than
you could count.

Maybe Shaa could ﬁgure it out. Were
there any other symptoms I could iden-
tity, any new impediments to my bod-
ily functions or processes of thought,
any untoward cravings, any ... wait a
minute. Did I think that? When did
I start running off at the mind like
some cheap paid-by-the-word potboiler
poet? I tried to remember back. Could
it be that my thought patterns and
my trains of words were occasionally
becoming more lyrical than I was used
to?
But how do you pin something like
that down, anyway?
People change,
they evolve.
Unless it’s blatant, how
do you tell some drug’s been tinkering
with your mind?
“I hope you have nothing to hide,”
said Ballista.
“Huh?” I said again. “Why’s that?”
He gestured ahead.
I leaned my

head out the window and craned ahead,
learning in the process from the stiff-
ness in my neck and creaking in my
shoulders that my skeleton, at least,
had witnessed the passing of time that
my consciousness had ignored. From
this vantage point, though, I could now
see one of the major causes of the con-
gestion on the approach to the bridge.
The highway had entered an area
where warehouses and light manufac-
tories were crammed together, elbowed
apart only by irregular streets and al-
leys that twisted their ways off into a
dark maze beyond. Foot and mounted
police and highway guards had been
visible in occasional knots. They were
keeping the trafﬁc orderly and in mo-
tion, I suppose, but even more than
that they seemed to have their eyes on
the district behind them. I’d had the
feeling they were there to keep raiders

from darting out of their lurking-dens
and harassing the highway trafﬁc. If
you were a desperado it looked like a
perfectly good tactic. You could strike
and be gone, losing any pursuit in the
deadly tangle of what could only be the
notorious Stainside slums. That didn’t
mean the police deployment wasn’t
workable too, but there was clearly a
lot more Stainside than there were of
them. The police forces were bolstered
by numerous small forces of bullyboys
and toughmen apparently ﬁelded by
business owners and local industry
associations.
Any way you sliced it, though, this
was clearly not an area to stop off for
the night or put your feet up for a quiet
meal and a pipe.
Nevertheless, as I saw now, lean-
ing out the window, these keeping-
the-peace activities were not the only

mission the greater Peridol police force
was conducting in the area. “They’re
not seriously trying to screen everyone
heading over the bridge,” I said, “are
they? They’ve got to be kidding.”
“Perhaps they’ve received some par-
ticular tip,” said Ballista. “There have
been reports of unrest, various dissi-
dent groups entering the city and the
like. The Empire has some sensitivity
about irredentist sentiments boiling
over during the Knitting.”
“If you say so.” But they couldn’t be
serious. Between this bridge and the
others there had to be thousands of peo-
ple entering the city. And what about
boats? Yet there they were, several pla-
toons worth of foot and another troop
of horse funneling the trafﬁc down and
examining each entrant closely as they
waved them through.
As I watched,
a cart ﬁlled with wheat in sacks was

pulled aside for a more detailed inspec-
tion. Trafﬁc headed in the opposite di-
rection was much more sparse, which
may have had something to do with
the fact that it was clearly swimming
upstream against the cataract,
but
even the outgoing trafﬁc was meriting
attention from the cops.
Fortunately I didn’t have anything
to hide, or at least not anything that
could be picked out by a frisking cop.
Even the fact that the checkpoint
wasn’t staffed by cops alone, attested
to by the slightly membranous sheen
of the curtain of air hanging across
the road in the midst of the squad,
shouldn’t make any difference to me.
Most everyone seemed oblivious to the
curtain’s presence, even though it was
rippling with constant surface waves,
while each live being passing through
it sparked a brief polychromatic au-

rora resonating from their aura. The
controlling sorcerer was seated off to
the side on a keg, the strands of the
curtain winding into a collator matrix
suspended in the air in front of her. Ev-
ery so often she’d speak to the sergeant
next to her or just point someone out
with a ﬁnger, and that person would be
stopped for additional interrogation.
From this distance, it was impossi-
ble to determine the curtain’s own in-
terrogation sensitivity or the settings
of the collator.
It was a surprisingly
high-order construct to ﬁnd in civil ser-
vice, but then Peridol obviously could
afford the best. Even so, I was sure I’d
pass through it without a peep, which
had its bad side as well as its good. At
this point, I wouldn’t have necessarily
minded elucidation on my situation
whatever its source.
As I’d expected, though, no eluci-

dation was forthcoming.
We drew
abreast of the inspection area, passed
placidly through the probe curtain,
and proceeded ahead up the bridge.
Moving through the curtain I’d felt
a brief dancing tingle that was sort
of the reverse of being pricked with
tiny needles; more like a crew of in-
visible tailors had attached threads
to my skin and clothes and were all
tugging and reweaving simultaneously
in an attempt to turn me into a spas-
modic marionette.
Fradjikan/Ballista
squirmed in his seat, scratched his
side with one hand and his back with
the other,
and muttered something
about inadequate bath conditions on
the road.
I hadn’t ﬁgured him for a magic-
user, and it didn’t look as though he
had the kind of pipeline into one’s
perceptions that the metabolic link to

Gashanatantra gave me, so I wasn’t
surprised
he’d
misinterpreted
what
had happened. It was more amazing to
me that I hadn’t. My ability to pull in-
formation out of Gash was apparently
still getting better. Either that or the
link improved at close range and Gash
was somewhere in the city up ahead.
I wondered what would happen when
the link was ﬁnally cut. Would I retain
the capabilities I’d soaked up, or would
I be back to the status of a blind infant
as far as my rapport with sorcery was
concerned? Could I actually be getting
attached to the idea of being magically
literate?
“A square is located beyond the
bridge,” said Ballista.
“Perhaps you
would like to disembark there.”
“Fine with me,” I said. The central
section of the bridge was a free span
far enough off the high-water mark for

a clipper ship to pass underneath and
wide enough so the ship could proba-
bly tack while it was slipping through,
too. Multiple arches sunk into caissons
stretched in both directions back to-
ward the shore. To the left I could see
another bridge of similar construction,
and some distance off on the right a
lower span with a winched-up draw-
bridge section. Although I’d obviously
never visited the Tongue Water before,
the rows of docks and wharves lining
both banks south toward the Hook, the
congestion in the channel (which was
of a density virtually matching that of
the land), and the distinct reek of sea
water liberally salted with sewage cer-
tainly were everything I had imagined.
And then there was the island city
of Peridol proper stretching out ahead -
the hill of the Crust with its sparkling
mansions, the ancient metal towers of

the palace complex, everywhere the
sprawl of house and hovel and temple,
slum and precinct and parish, industry
and business and commerce.
Amidst
the chimney plumes and haze of smoke
from wood, coal, and wizard ﬁres, the
lakes and sward of Mathom Park ad-
joining the palace walls still glittered
green and silver in the sun. Then we
were on the downward slope of the
bridge, and the buildings at the shore
rose up to block from sight the view.
The trafﬁc entered a canyon of soot-
stained wood and stone.
Beneath
the wheels, the road surface, which
had been alternating between paving
slabs and the newer asphalt-and-stone,
changed back to cobblestones; some of
the side streets as we passed, though,
had no other pavement than gravel
or dirt.
The highway wound off and
lost size to diverging distributaries

like tentacles leaving the body of an
octopus. We rounded another bend and
debouched into Ballista’s square.
It
was a open space only in the sense that
it lacked major buildings; the din and
the crush more than ﬁlled in the gap.
This was apparently the destination
of many of the farmers and herders
we’d joined on the road. Beyond a large
sheep paddock and an adjoining area
for wholesale butchering stretched a
tangle of stalls and carts, each piled
with produce and tenanted by gestic-
ulating hucksters, one here waving
by the neck a plucked chicken, one
there brandishing a carp, another jug-
gling apples, all yelling and arguing
simultaneously as they tried to con-
vert strollers into customers and the
glint of an eye into cash.
As far as
the eye could imagine were throngs
of dog sellers, ﬂower girls, ﬂypaper

merchants in dilapidated top hats dec-
orated with grimy samples of their
wares, hardware dealers, tinkers, rag-
men, knife grinders, ginger-beer men,
apple sellers, oyster men, match ven-
dors, lemonade hawkers mixing their
vile brew on the spot in tubs, and even
a few bold fellows offering oranges
and other citrus fruits full in the skin
and fresh from the tree, or so they
were crying. The smells hit with the
same impact as the sight, under an
assault of saddle soap, leather, brass
polish, strong tobacco, wood ﬁres, bak-
ing bread, roasting meat, fresh and
rotting produce, and people whose re-
lationship with bathing water was at
best hypothetical. “I’ll get out here,” I
said.
“I see a bit of an alcove off to the
side,” said Fradjikan. “Lowell can pull
up there.”

There was an alcove of sorts, but as
far as I was concerned one place in this
tumult seemed as good as any other.
Still, I had a vague hunch tickling at
the edge of my mind.
If Fradjikan
wanted to set the agenda, I could do
worse than see where it might lead.
“Thanks,” I said, shoving open the door
and leaning out.
I elbowed aside a
street urchin with his hand out for con-
tributions and jumped down into the
vacated space. “See you around.”
“Oh, yes,” I thought I heard him mut-
ter under his breath, and then the car-
riage pulled slowly away.
I had a rendezvous address from
Shaa and no idea how to get there, and
no useful orientation to where I was,
either. At my back was Fradjikan’s al-
cove, a hollow between the dark brick
walls of two buildings fronting on the
square; the depths of the alcove were

fenced off with a stout iron rail and a
hedge. Ahead of me was a row of stalls
arrayed around an ornate fountain
with some sort of stone-and-verdigris
civic monument in its center. I started
for the stalls.
If I could get direc-
tions from one of the sellers under the
guise of negotiations for purchase, that
would be best, but if worse came to
worse there might be an explanatory
plaque on the monument.
Some kind of minor disturbance was
getting underway there, I noticed then,
as I made my way forward. The shout-
ing was perhaps a little louder than
the rest of the din.
That much was
unremarkable. The unusual part was
the way a row of stalls was shuddering
back and forth. Then all the stalls were
more than shuddering, they were liter-
ally shaking themselves apart. Thatch
and netting ﬂew into the air, rods and

boards scattered, produce went rolling.
A plucked chicken passed arching over
my head. As the stalls fell away, the
fountain was clearly revealed.
The pool was frothing with white-
caps and the water jets were wildly
spraying
over
everything
in
sight.
What they were spraying foamed and
sizzled, though, and seemed (although
this might have been an illusion) to be
turning red rather than the clear of
pure water or even the green of algae
and scum. A wave of water, now un-
mistakably red, broke over the stone
retaining wall and frothed over the
remains of half-a-dozen food stalls. Un-
der the water the wood ignited. With
a whoom! that sent me reeling back a
pace the liquid boiled out in a ball of
ﬂame. Coils of ﬁre writhed up.
But the tendrils of ﬁre weren’t ran-
dom. They were forming letters.

Another word took shape partway
around the fountain, rooted in the
remains of a wagon.
In the com-
mon script, it seemed to say “FREE
KEN,” and over on the other side was
“RIGHTS FOR”. I was trying to remem-
ber what Fradjikan had been talking
about earlier, that bit about irredentist
sentiments and the possibility of ter-
rorism, when the rearing equestrian
statue in the middle of the fountain
began to creak and move.
This is not my problem, I thought.
The upraised foreleg of the stone horse
pawed the air, ﬁve feet above my head,
and the regal-looking rider glanced
around,
brandishing
his
skyward-
pointed sword.
The sword may have
been stone, but it was now showing a
wicked edge and at least the gleam of
steel.
Beneath the horse in the cen-
ter of the fountain a pulsing glow was

visible through the cascading water.
I squinted through the mist. Force-
lines were warping into that glow, join-
ing into a spinning orb. Even from this
distance, I could detect the presence
of matrix programming and a catalytic
power source.
It’s not my problem, I
tried to remind myself, but no one else
was stepping forward, the crowd was
starting to reach that edge of panic
that would convert it into a trampling
mob, and the huge sword was start-
ing to cut swaths out of the air as its
wielder eyed the people around it with
increasing interest.
I yanked my walking stick out from
its perch atop my pack and dropped
the pack on the ground.
The urchin
kid who’d accosted me getting out of
the carriage was still at my heels.
I
dug a coin out of my belt and showed
it to him. “There’s two more for you if

you watch this pack,” I told him. “The
money’s worth more than anything you
could get for the stuff, and anyway I’d
come after you and I guarantee you
wouldn’t like that. Deal?”
The kid took the coin, bit it, and
grinned widely, his expression missing
a few of the customarily expected teeth.
“What’s going on, mister?”
“Stick around and watch.
Damn
it.” A complete wall of ﬂame-drawn
words now encircled the fountain. The
surface of the fountain and the lashing
waves were ablaze, too, the ﬁres mount-
ing to the belly of the prancing horse.
I could have easily stood upright un-
der the horse, or rather it would have
been easy except for the ﬁre and the
water and the energy with which the
horse was stomping around. The rider
leaned low across the horse’s neck and
scythed around with the sword.
The

blade swished through the ﬁres around
the fountain and chopped through the
remains of a stall.
When the stall had fallen over a
moment ago, it had trapped a knot of
people beneath it. They were now fran-
tically trying to dig their way out. The
sword lifted up and the rider leaned
out further, preparing to chop.
I had the walking stick in my hand.
It was humming, vibrating, virtually
dragging me forward.
I’ve always
known I’m not the world’s greatest
swordsman.
Especially after seeing
Max and even Shaa I could tell what
class I’m in, and it’s not theirs.
I’m
competent, though, or enough to get
by with under normal circumstances
anyway, especially since detecting is a
lot more brainwork than swordwork,
or at least it’s supposed to be if you’re
doing it right.
But I’d already done

whatever detecting was appropriate to
the situation; that spinning orb was
the source of this manifestation, and
given that it was shielded to magic
beyond my minimal level of expertise
the only way to take it out would be to
smash it.
The stone horse had splashed over
to the edge of the fountain and looked
about ready to trot out of it entirely. I
took a last glance around. I thought I
glimpsed Fradjikan’s carriage still off
to the side, but neither he nor anyone
else was volunteering their services. I
subvocalized the call to Monoch and
stepped forward.
Immediately I was stumbling, al-
most falling to one knee as a vise
grabbed my hand and twisted me
around toward the ground, but some-
how I was still keeping my balance and
coming out of the almost-fall hurtling

forward in a dead run.
Cold ﬂames
sheathed my own hand, tearing back
from the outline of the walking stick;
then the outline ﬁrmed into the rune-
etched metal of a very nasty sword
indeed. Monoch had arrived.
I hadn’t unleashed him lately. We’d
had words about that, or whatever
passed for words when you were com-
municating with a testy sword. Flam-
ing swords are not exactly unobtrusive
in the best of circumstances, and of
course I’d been trying to be surrepti-
tious rather than making a scene of
myself, but the most important reason
I’d kept Monoch under wraps was that
I’d managed to avoid a ﬁght.
Over
the same period, of course, I’d been
getting my increased handle on rec-
ognizing the presence of sorcery and
being able to analyze it, through the
link to Gash. Monoch was also a link to

Gash, though. I hadn’t known whether
letting him loose would enhance or de-
grade the other side of the link, but
what I certainly hadn’t expected was
that Monoch would start giving me
advice.
The sword was recommending tac-
tics, or to be more precise it was taking
the tactical situation completely into
its own hands.
We rushed forward,
Monoch now low and trailing behind
me, concealed by my body from the
animated statue. Between us and the
fountain, though, was still the bill-
board of ﬂame. It was real ﬂame, too,
not an illusion, as some of the people
who’d been standing close had discov-
ered to their misfortune. Some had es-
caped with charred clothing or singed
eyebrows, but several folks I passed
on the way in were showing blisters
or open red skin.
I tried to aim for

the space between “DOWNTRODDEN”
and “PEOPLE,” dropped my head, and
put on an extra burst of speed.
As I
drew up to the barrier, though, the
ﬂames on each side leaned together
and wrapped their tendrils toward me.
Something went click in the back of
my head. I heard a brief garbled mum-
ble, as though someone’s ﬁve-minute
recitation had been compressed into
a half-second burst, and saw a match-
ing blur of symbols streak through my
mind. The ﬂames around me froze. I
mean, they not only paused in their
writhing, they went from plasma to
dripping solids with arctic gusts boil-
ing off them as the still-active ﬁres
on either side got to work vaporizing
them. Remarkable as that was, there
were still other things to attend to.
Looking down from his twenty-foot
height ahead of me straight into my

eyes was the stone glare of the horse’s
rider.
He brought his sword around in a
vast arc parallel to the ground. Monoch
had anticipated this, though, and had
vectored me in just barely on the same
side of the horse as the rider’s sword
arm. I now cut to the right under the
horse’s neck, bent low, and scrambled
along the base of the fountain.
A large splash sounded behind me
as I stood back up and a wall of ﬂaming
water broke over the fountain’s lip and
spilled full over me. Whatever it was
that was causing the water to ignite,
oil or magic or aqueous camphor, all it
did was hiss and crackle when it hit
my body.
In fact, I didn’t even quite
feel it hit; it was more like the ﬂuid de-
cided a half-inch or so over my clothes
that it didn’t want to fall on me after
all and ran down instead, as though I

was wearing an invisible shell rather
than the same old outﬁt stained from
the sea and the road. Water splashed
again; the rider had given up trying
to reach me from his off-side with the
sword, and the horse was repositioning
itself while the stone guy hoisted the
sword over his head and brought it
down on the near side toward me.
I
hopped the ledge around the fountain
and dropped into the water.
The horse’s left foreleg was within
reach and Monoch was ready.
As I
swung, Monoch let loose with his best
beehive whine and laid a wheel of sil-
ver ﬁre in the air. The impact rattled
my joints from my wrists up to my
shoulders and down my spine into my
knees, but when my teeth clattered
back into their sockets I saw a clean
cut halfway through the stone. Monoch
had already pulled free and was urging

me on. I dove ahead under the horse’s
belly as the rider’s sword plunged down
into the space I’d just left.
My dive hadn’t taken me far since I’d
started waist-deep in water.
Monoch
was already waving again in the air,
though, and was dragging me back to
my feet. I braced myself and did what
he wanted.
Both hands clenched on
the hilt, I swung as hard as I could
straight up in the air.
Again we hit stone.
This time the
blow was more shove than slice. I cast
a quick glance over my shoulder as the
shadow overhead shifted and gave way
to light. With the rider still off-balance
on the other side of the horse and
trying to recover from his downward
slash, the horse had stepped reﬂex-
ively down with its damaged foreleg to
try to stabilize itself.
The push we’d
just given had put even more pressure

on that side, and now as the damaged
stone shattered the horse was starting
to go down.
Ahead through the ﬂame-capped wa-
ter was the controlling orb.
A wave
from the thrashing horse caught me
from behind and washed me toward
it.
Then a jet of water punched into
my chest and knocked me over back-
ward. A ring of stone water-jets were
between me and the orb, and they were
swiveling down like crossbows to take
aim at me. I drew in breath and dove.
A two-footed kick and a few frantic
strokes with my free arm later, Monoch
told me to plant my legs and swing. I
broke water and let loose, and the
closest water-jet – now within range -
went ﬂying. The others were creaking
as they cranked themselves around.
Behind me, the horse was lying on its
belly on the bottom but had managed

to remain upright, and the rider was
reaching out for me.
I drew Monoch
back like a spear and then thrust for-
ward, pushing off the bottom at the
same time.
I had planned to let go of his hilt,
too, and launch him like a javelin, but
Monoch was having none of that. The
sword hurtled ahead with more thrust
than I’d launched it. Just as I realized
Monoch was not allowing my ﬁngers to
let go, the pull of the sword started to
try to yank my arms out of their sock-
ets at the shoulder. Instead, my shoul-
ders held but my feet left the ground
and then broke the surface of the wa-
ter entirely. We still weren’t going to
make it. The band of mist was in reach,
and I could feel the exact position of the
control orb inside it, but even this mad
lunge was going to fall short.
I didn’t know what would happen

if we did slice up the orb. We might
set loose some booby-trap terminal de-
fense system or cause a chain-reaction
between the orb’s ﬁeld and Monoch’s
own bound-in magic.
The orb might
even be resistant to physical attack. I
knew what would happen if we didn’t,
though. I would go head ﬁrst into the
water, the water jets would make it
into position to bear on me, and before
I could get out of the way that big stone
sword was going to come down on my
head.
Except Monoch had another trick he
hadn’t mentioned. He took dead aim
on the orb at the limit of our lunge
and stretched. I thought the bones of
my forearm had separated from the
rest of my body at the elbow, but that
hadn’t been the purpose of his latest
maneuver.
The middle part of the
blade narrowed and squeezed another

foot of rapier-stuff out the tip, spearing
the orb neatly through its middle, and
Monoch’s silver ﬂames ﬂowed out to
surround it.
The orb cracked like a
shattered egg. Its released ﬁeld-lines
went ﬂailing into the air. That’s when
I ﬁnally did smash full-length into the
water, and in the commotion I gave up
on following exactly what happened
next.
When I made it back to my feet
and stopped coughing up the better
part of a pond, the ﬁres on the water
and the ﬂaming messages had gone
out.
The water jets were frozen in
gnarled shapes, pointing every which-
way.
They had gone back to being
normal stone, though, as had the loom-
ing ﬁgure of the stone general leaning
in toward the center of the fountain,
his sword just over my head. Although
it was an unusual posture for a statue,

it did project a sense of motion and
the fever of action, so it was probably
an improvement to the esthetics of the
monument overall.
Monoch was back to his normal
sword-shape, but his hilt was still ap-
parently bonded to my hand. “I got to
give you credit,” I told him. “I ﬁgured
you for just a hack-and-slash blood-
drinker, but those moves were pretty
slick.”
I had the feeling that Monoch wasn’t
too unhappy with me either.
I spoke
the words that would send him back
to his stealth-mode, and he didn’t even
complain this time about retreating to
his lair. Now all I had to do was leave
the area before somebody decided to do
something about me. Whether they’d
want to throw me a party or throw me
in jail, attention was still the last thing
I was looking for. I slogged as fast as I

could toward the exit.
Out beyond the charred wreckage
of the stalls, the dazed crowd was just
starting to pull itself together. I spot-
ted the kid with my pack, though; I
hoped I’d held onto my pocket change.
At the back of the plaza I thought I
saw the top of a familiar carriage.
I
couldn’t tell for sure but it wouldn’t
have surprised me in the least. Why
wouldn’t Fradjikan hang around to see
what happened?
Wasn’t he the one
who’d gotten me into this, after all?

Chapter9
SO THAT WAS THE STORY behind
the walking stick;
a ﬂaming sword.
And Fradjikan hadn’t picked up the
slightest hint. He had been interested
in Spilkas, even if it had had more to
do with circumstance than deductive
logic, but still that had to be good for
something.
Flaming swords were undetectable
to the magically untrained eye, and
usually (in their hidden mode) to the

sorcerously cognizant as well.
They
were secret weapons, after all. Those
Fradjikan had heard about, never hav-
ing encountered (to his knowledge) one
himself, tended to hide themselves as
normal swords, though, making their
magical manifestation a much less
ﬂagrant affair.
By all accounts there
weren’t too many of the things around
in any guise, however, which might
make it possible to track down this
one’s pedigree, and through it Spilkas’
own.
Spilkas himself had proved to have
more surprises than merely the sword.
He’d been rather impressive, in fact.
Fradjikan had put the odds against
Spilkas taking the initiative to involve
himself in suppressing the fountain
and statue’s threat. As it had turned
out, the element Fradjikan had put in
place that would have drawn Spilkas

in, whatever his will, had not even
required activation.
Given the involvement of Spilkas,
whether willing or not, Fradi had also
doubted that the resolution of his en-
counter with the statue would have
seen him alive, much less ambulatory.
The plan would not have strictly re-
quired either. It therefore was pleasant
to realize that the esthetics would now
be signiﬁcantly enhanced by having
Spilkas encounter his fate while still
incarnate.
That also meant Spilkas
would remain available for use in the
more advanced play that was rapidly
coming up.
Lowell, from the sound of it appar-
ently laying about with his whip, ﬁ-
nally breached an exit from the square.
The
fountain
area
with
its
heroic
statue now once again frozen into stone
slipped around the corner and was lost

to sight, even though Fradjikan craned
his neck from the side window for one
last glimpse. Ah, well. The next step
would be to get the image to the -
He was not alone in the carriage.
“Good day,” said the new ﬁgure op-
posite him. “That was an interesting
piece of work.”
The ﬁgure - probably a man, but
who could really tell - sat in a pool
of misty shadow, a top hat pulled low
and the upturned collar of his great-
coat pulled high, arms folded across
his chest. “Good day to you, sir,” said
Fradjikan. “What work was that?”
“Tactically quite adroit,” the ﬁgure
continued.
“On the higher levels of
discourse, though, less well chosen.”
Considering the circumstances, it
might be more prudent to play along
with him. “Why is that?”
“Consider this,” reﬂected the ﬁgure.

“He now knows about you.
Unless I
miss my guess, he will also realize it
was your hand that inserted him into
the situation.”
“That would seem unlikely,” said
Fradjikan.
“Even if that should hap-
pen, what of it?”
The
shadowed
ﬁgure
scrutinized
him.
“I have observed in you a ten-
dency to value yourself rather more
and your adversaries rather less than
they deserve.”
“Oh, you have observed that, have
you?”
“If I were you, I might also ask my-
self whether I was the only operative
who could possibly carry out your par-
ticular charge.”
Fradjikan, who had in fact asked
himself that very question, but not re-
cently, certainly not since things had
really gotten rolling, said, “My suc-

cess will be the only demonstration
required. A success that is at the mo-
ment perfectly well in train.”
“In a matter such as this, who can
say what constitutes success? Perhaps
the major issue at stake is a trial of you,
yourself, rather than the obvious goal
against which you have been pointed.”
“My command of situational esthet-
ics,” said Fradjikan, a bit testily, “are
second to none.”
“Ah, your external esthetics perhaps,
but the tenor of your own attitude
and behavior?” The ﬁgure shrugged.
“Who can hold a perfect mirror to him-
self? Take this fellow with the walking
stick, for example.
How often does
this happen, that you meet someone
against whom you bear a contract face-
to-face?”
Why was this god - no, not just a
god, apparently Fradi’s patron - didac-

ticizing with him this way? “He’s only
a bit player,” Fradjikan said carefully,
“at most a pawn who fancies himself a
rook. A tool for leverage against Max-
imillian.” Leverage to be applied in a
most cunning manner, Fradi still had
to admit to himself. Well, what of it? If
you couldn’t appreciate your own work,
what was the point of getting up in the
morning?
The god regarded him in the silence
of contemplation.
Then at last he
spoke. “Stay away from this one. He
is a wild card. His presence may lead
to things you will be happier not to be
involved in.”
“What things?
To what do you al-
lude?”
“I,” said the god, “have spoken.” Va-
por billowed from his greatcoat, and
perhaps (although this was most likely
illusion) from his mouth and eyes

as well.
Fog ﬁlled the compartment.
Fradi felt for the side window, and
then for the panel next to Lowell. Fi-
nally, with the door open and Frad-
jikan hanging onto it, the pea-souper
began to dissipate. The god himself, of
course, was long gone.
Lowell had noticed nothing, neither
an entrance nor an exit, except for the
suddenly billowing fog which Fradi
had brought to his attention himself.
That might be a characteristic of the
situation or a warning that Lowell
might have collaborated in bringing
it off.
Either way Lowell would bear
increased scrutiny.
The larger situation itself would also
warrant another going-over. Either the
god had misread Fradi’s personality,
or he hadn’t.
In any case, the god’s
admonition had served primarily to in-
crease Spilkas’ interest value. Perhaps

it would be prudent to consider the bet-
ter part of valor in this case, and ﬁnd
another stratagem, but ... no. No, that
would be foolish.
Fradi had clearly
been even luckier than he’d originally
anticipated.
Spilkas was apparently
worth more than he’d seemed, and a
rook mistaken for a pawn is always a
valuable ﬁnd.
If there was one rule in this business,
it was never to throw out a usable piece.
Fradi directed Lowell to the site of the
most urgent errand, and then, their
business there complete, onward to-
ward home. A horse was already in the
courtyard; apparently this was Fradi’s
day for consultation. The visitor was
already installed in the library. Fradi
shut the double door behind him as
he entered. “Welcome, my lord,” said
Fradi. “I trust you ﬁnd the brandy to
your liking?”

“Did it come with the house or was
its acquisition one of your other deals?
I thought I knew the location of every
cask of the ‘45 within the city limits.”
Fradjikan moved aside the cloak
that was tossed casually over the set-
tee and seated himself, his pose one of
studied ease but his senses at full alert.
The man across the room from him ex-
amining the bookcases, dashing in his
red and black day-wear with the silver
accessory highlights, was not one you
wanted to let drift from your attention;
Fradjikan, as one peer to another, was
certainly in a position to appreciate
this. “Are you running short? I’ll have
the extra bottle sent around to you.”
“Senor Ballista is a man of reﬁne-
ment,” the visitor said, cocking his
head to side and speaking as if from
deep consideration.
“Are you certain
you were never a quartermaster? You

succeed in unearthing the most amaz-
ing things.”
“A
signiﬁcant
compliment,”
said
Fradjikan, “coming from you.
I pre-
sume your own campaign of acquisi-
tion proceeds equally as well?”
“Ah,” said the other.
“The opening
has been made, and all told it achieved
its established goals.
The ﬁnal reso-
lution will take somewhat more work.
This campaign - did you call it? - will
not be as simple as strolling into a shop
and making a purchase from goods on
hand, but then that was clear from the
outset. The most worthwhile ones take
time. The process will yield its own re-
wards, to be sure, and in any case that
was to be expected.”
“She suspects nothing?”
“She suspects something, of course,”
said the Scapula, “but perhaps nothing
more than would be warranted by my

reputation.
She’s particularly sharp,
for a woman, yet of course she tries to
deny she is a woman. That makes her
all the riper. She’ll come around easily
enough, have no doubt about it.” He
paused, then looked off in the distance
and smiled.
“It may take a bit more
judicious wooing.”
“Without that where’s the sport?”
“Indeed, so.” The Scapula eyed the
level of brandy in his snifter, then
crossed to the sideboard to refresh
it.
“You have someone watching the
nephew?”
“There are those who are on it,” said
Fradjikan, “again judiciously. The boy
is guarded and apparently shielded as
well. Also predictably, and it can all be
handled if necessary. What did you de-
cide to do about the brother?”
“He is a bit tricky,” the Scapula ad-
mitted.
“He’s busy, though, and I’ve

tossed a few more things his way that
will keep his workload active, and in
any case he’s certain his sister can take
care of herself. Even if he questions the
situation, as he very well might some-
where down the line, his sister should
be so enraptured that his freedom of
action will be circumscribed.
Beyond
that, he can be handled, as you say, if
necessary.”
Fradjikan had no doubt that the
Crawﬁsh was one of the many people
who would be handled by the Scapula,
whether that was strictly necessary or
not, whether as part of the immediate
sequence of events or not. The Scapula
was a man on the make; in more ways
than one, of course. When one’s ambi-
tions, and, to be frank, one’s appetites,
were as great as the Scapula’s, and
when one had already achieved the
Scapula’s level of achievement, one

had to become quite adroit at identi-
fying those who required handling, as
well as implementing against them
one’s own plans.
Which wasn’t to say that one was al-
ways successful in what one set out to
do. “What sort of past history do you
have with this Crawﬁsh?”
“This and that,” said the Scapula
dismissively. “He’s rather like me, you
know.
More diffuse in his objectives,
more distractible, on occasion arguably
more dissolute. He may be a challenge,
but in the larger sense no more than
an obstacle tactical in scale. Especially
with the intelligence his sister will
provide, yes, my colleague?”
“Just so,” said Fradi.
The Scapula
was a valuable ally, no doubt about
that, but there was equally no doubt
that he couldn’t be trusted for a mo-
ment. That was a general characteris-

tic of those folks Fradi tended to end
up in league with, and it, too, had
always proved to be something that
could be handled. Fradjikan had had
a lot of experience with people occu-
pying thrones, or those who wished
to do so, so the Scapula’s ambition in
itself was nothing new.
The Scapula
might be fully as good at intrigue as
Fradjikan himself, though, which was
more unusual.
Fradi knew he himself could become
a target if and when their interests
diverged. Equally plausible, however,
was the chance of securing more busi-
ness or even a new imperial patron by
demonstrating his worth. “Not to im-
pugn your campaign plan,” Fradjikan
ventured, “yet perhaps there is some
additional force I might bring to bear
on the problem.”
“We shall see. It would be a mistake,

I think, to lean too hard at this stage.
You want your hands on her secret
archives, I suspect, much more than I;
after all, you do have your erstwhile
master with whom to contend.”
The Scapula was sharp. Fradi had
never told him about his interest in
the god-material in the Archives, or
his hope of gaining insurance from the
archival information against the one
who’d brought him back to life for this
job.
“An intriguing speculation,” said
Fradi.
“I see you agree. With the material
at her disposal, though, the Archivist
could become a major player, if only she
had the motivation. Acting to give her
that motivation would be, you will also
agree, a signiﬁcant mistake. At worst
she can be neutralized, at best out-and-
out coopted.”
This certainly was the big city.
It

wasn’t every day you turned up a pawn
who might really be a rook, and yet
here in the person of the Archivist was
another one.
The fate of all pieces,
whether pawn or rook, was ultimately
to be taken, but here as always the
correspondence between chess and life
broke down.
In chess, pieces didn’t
have the option of changing sides.

Chapter10
THE SCAPULA WAS DOING HIS
BEST to become a nuisance. The vase
with the rose had been a nice little
touch, as much for being unexpected
and for being produced with a pleas-
antly offbeat ﬂourish than because of
the details of the gift itself. The mes-
sage of the ﬂower was on the way to
being overwhelmed by repetition, how-
ever, and by an expansion in scale. Not
only had bouquets and parcels of vari-

ous sorts been arriving at the Archives,
he knew where she lived, too. Leen had
refused to meet with the couturier, but
the fellow had obviously gotten enough
of a look at her to be able to assess her
coloring and estimate her size. Quite
accurately, too, as it turned out. The
maid had already had the ball gown
out of its wrappings and hanging on
the door when Leen had gotten home,
and hadn’t given her a moment’s peace
until she’d tried the damned thing on.
Now the woman wouldn’t let her send
it back.
Once you started with this nonsense
there were really no end of problems.
Leen had been idly contemplating the
idea of putting in an appearance at
the Inauguration Ball even before the
Scapula’s arrival on the scene.
Now
he had polarized the question. If she
went on her own and wore his gown,

that would still be as good as walking
in the door on his arm. If she left the
gown out of the picture and dressed
herself he would most likely take it as
a slap, and that would also still leave
the maid to be contended with.
The whole situation was nothing but
a mess and a bother.
With the Scapula or his agents all
but camping on her door, and with his
campaign obviously picking up steam,
it was impossible to ignore things, ei-
ther, in the hope he’d get tired of her
stubbornness and would let her off the
hook.
There was only one thing to
do. Leen had decided to appear at the
Archives late and use the extra time to
consult an expert.
Reentering the street after her meet-
ing, Leen fully realized she should
have known better. There was no ques-
tion of her sister’s expertise in assig-

nations and affairs de Coeur, though,
and her advice in managing touchy sit-
uations was well enough known that
these days she kept regular consulting
hours. What Leen found she had over-
looked was that clients may have been
clients, but family was always family.
Susannah had received her in the
south-facing
dayroom
high
on
the
Crust.
After the expected grousings
about how she wouldn’t be up at
such an ungodly hour for just any-
one, Susannah had ﬁnally loaded up
on enough coffee to be willing to hear
Leen out.
As Leen wrapped up, Susannah had
frowned out the bay window at the city,
her back propped against a generous
cushion on her strategically placed set-
tee. “Yes?” said Susannah. “I thought
you said you had a problem. Where is
it? You certainly haven’t told it to me.”

“Obviously he’s after the wrong per-
son,” Leen said. “I think he was really
after you.”
Her sister brightened. “Do you think
so?”
“Well, he couldn’t have wanted me.
That’s what I told him.”
Susannah’s face was usually an open
book, at least to someone who’d grown
up between the same covers, so to
speak.
The demands of her ego vied
with those of honesty, or at least those
of Susannah’s longer-term goal of see-
ing Leen prematurely ensconced in
permanent domesticity.
Reluctantly,
she had ﬁnally acknowledged that the
Scapula, rake though he was, might
very well have had Leen on his mind.
“I’ve told you and told you,” Leen’s
sister had said, “you could be all the
rage yourself if you’d only pay a little
attention to things outside your books.

You do come from the same stock as
me, after all. I’m having my own little
soiree in a few days, you know - you
must bring him by.”
This was not at all the answer Leen
had hoped for. She had looked for the
reassurance of her sister’s usual cat-
tiness, and so Susannah’s refusal to
abide by her typical rules left Leen
even more confused than she had
hoped to be relieved.
Leen had not
gone so far as to commit to anything,
much less to producing the Scapula
as Susannah’s piece de resistance, but
that small victory was the only one she
felt she had wrung from the encounter.
Generally speaking, Susannah was
not oblivious to the political implica-
tions of personal relationships, and the
manipulation of intimacy for purposes
of leverage or blackmail was certainly
one of her specialties. In this particu-

lar case Susannah’s awareness of these
factors still hadn’t made her advice
on the subject especially useful.
“Of
course he might be up to something,”
Susannah had said. “The best way to
ﬁnd out what that something is would
be to play along with him. Just make
certain you have some fun while you’re
doing it. Can you do that? Of course
you can; you are my sister.”
So it had clearly been a waste of
time, and all the more so since she
should
have
known
it
in
advance.
Leen’s sister wasn’t the right expert
to visit at all. She should have started
with her brother.
The Crust had its own road main-
tenance and sanitation brigade, but
these would have been useless if the
district hadn’t also been equipped with
walls and guards. As she wedged her
way through the Tabasco Gate at the

base of the hill into the press of trafﬁc,
Leen was even more shocked than she
had been on the way over. She hadn’t
been out in the streets much at all
lately, had been taking her constitu-
tional in the park and her exercise on
the practice grounds near the Reading
Room in the palace complex.
Rather
than keep up her own residence on the
Crust or bother with a ﬂat, Leen had
let a suite of rooms in the Block. As
an ofﬁcer of the state she was entitled
to it, of course, but in contrast to most
of the others similarly eligible she was
actually using the privilege. The Block
was a bit dreary and rattly, and the
rooms were not what you could call
warm, but if you knew the right short-
cuts the warren of the Block was no
more than a ﬁve-minute stroll through
some of the nicer palace gardens and
a quick nip through the corner of the

hedge maze to the side entrance of the
building housing the Archives.
Her rooms in the Block were conve-
nient, then, but since they were also on
the palace grounds they too had kept
her insulated from the scale of the in-
ﬂux now sweeping over the city. As she
made her way west, Leen was just glad
she wasn’t involved in maintaining in-
ternal security. Or health and welfare,
for that matter.
Public hygiene had
been a concern of the ancients that
the Peridol government had chosen to
uphold, but with all these visitors un-
derfoot standards would be breaking
down right and left. Far too many of
the people around her were shabby
and unwashed.
Of course, given how much - or how
little - she’d been getting out in the city
even before the Knitting, it was possi-
ble standards had been falling down by

themselves. She’d have to talk to some-
one. Where was sanitation in the Cor-
pus infrastructure? One of the Hepatic
Lobes, perhaps, or more likely the First
Colonic Flexure. She -
Leen stopped. Something seemed to
attract her from the left. She squinted
over and cocked her ear, but even as
she did she realized that whatever had
caught her interest wasn’t something
she had heard or seen.
Whatever it
had been, it was gone now. There was
nothing remarkable on that side of the
street at all. A few street vendors, a
blacksmith shop, and the usual mix of
passersby.
A couple of grungy ne’er-
do-well travelers were leading a pack
horse; as early in the day as it was,
the lot of them already had at least
two sheets to the wind, judging by the
glazed expression of the young one in
the lead, and the way he appeared to

be simultaneously snifﬁng the air and
listening to it. Just then, the pair of
them bent right and shouldered their
way lengthwise across the trafﬁc, drag-
ging the reluctant horse behind them.
As they crossed ahead of Leen on their
way into a narrow side street, the eye
of the man holding the horse’s bridle
swung across her from beneath the
shady depths of a battered slouch hat.
For an instant, they locked glances;
then he was gone.
Leen shook her head to clear it. The
Scapula was obviously too much on
her mind. She didn’t even really like
him, although his physicality was cer-
tainly good for a pleasant tingle. For
one random squint from a peasant on
the street to give her so much of an
excited shiver, though, deﬁed rational
analysis. Perhaps this was the secret
of the Scapula’s modus operandi, to

raise appetites where there had been
none and then to provide himself as
the only comprehensive fulﬁllment. As
soon as she got back to the ofﬁce she
was going to get rid of the ﬂowers and
the rest of the stuff. Chances were it
was spiked.
Actually, it might be better to wrap
up his things and take them out
for analysis.
If she really was be-
ing bombarded by some aphrodisiac
pheromone it could be necessary to
seek out an antidote.
Of course, if what she needed was
an antidote to the ways of the ﬂesh
the last place she should be heading
now was the one she had now arrived
at, and whose bell-cord she was now
pulling.
A small window set high in
the door behind a stout barred grill
slid back.
“Is my brother around?”
Leen asked the door.

The door swung open.
“Yes he is,
actually,” said a man in a long tartan-
plaid bathrobe.
Protruding beneath
the bathrobe’s ﬂoor-scraping hem were
a pair of purple slippers with upturned
pointy toes.
The man’s tousled hair
was the red of carrot juice on a sunny
day at noon.
“He wasn’t expecting
you,” the fellow added, his tone a triﬂe
arch, “but I’m sure he’s glad to see you
anyway.”
“Is he? Would he want me to come in
off the street, then?”
“As long as you bring it up, I suppose
so. Come on, then.” Leen followed the
man down the hall and up a ﬂight of
stairs. “I just put a kettle on for tea,”
he said over his shoulder. “Would you
like some?”
“I’ve just come from Susannah’s.”
“Then you’ll be tired of fending off re-
freshments. I won’t mention it again.

The way she is with food and guests,
you could say she’s worse than Mother,
except that our mother never seemed
to be egging us on one way or the other.
Someone’s mother, then.”
“It must have worked,” Leen said.
“None of her children are scrawny.”
The front room on the second ﬂoor
overlooked the street and had already
had its shutters ﬂung open to catch
the light. Leen watched the trafﬁc be-
low while pots rattled in the kitchen
behind her.
“I suppose it’s this thing with the
Scapula on your mind,” her brother
called out through the open door.
Leen fought back the temptation to
ask him how he knew. The Crawﬁsh
made it his business to learn everyone
else’s, often before they knew it them-
selves. “What do you think he’s up to?”
“He’s a hard one to get solid intelli-

gence on,” Lemon admitted, entering
the room. The gouts of steam from his
mug brought the smell of honey and
warm milk mixed with the caress of
chamomile.
“Oh, bother,” she muttered.
“What was that?”
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
All my thought patterns are mixed up.
I keep thinking in, ah, physical allu-
sions.” The caress of chamomile, indeed.
“Just now on the way over I found my-
self attracted to some grubby man on
the street.” She collapsed into an arm-
chair.
“This is not in itself necessarily
a bad thing,” the Crawﬁsh said cau-
tiously. “I - what’s the matter?”
There was something half-buried un-
der the cushion.
Leen ﬁnally dug it
out and shook it out at arm’s length in
front of her. “I knew coming to see you

might not be the right thing either.”
“Ah, well, just toss that over there.
Perhaps she’ll be back for it some other
time.”
“The lacework is rather well done,”
Leen observed.
“What are these rib-
bons for, though?
And this springy
bit?”
“Here, give me that.” Lemon slipped
the garment neatly from her grasp and
made it disappear. “It’s not your size
anyway,” he added.
It was an interesting thought, though
“Augh,” said Leen, putting her head in
her hands.
“The Scapula has a good sense for
choosing his victims,” Lemon noted.
“I’ve actually been expecting him to go
after you for some time. You are one of
the more eligible women around, and
one of the most strategically placed as
well. Your reluctance to dally with the

social whirl would only be an added
attraction to a man like him.
There
may be a philosophical component,
too, I should think; the battle between
mind and heart, or gut, or some such, I
shouldn’t be surprised.”
“I can’t believe that’s all there is to
it.”
“When you get right down to it, nei-
ther do I.” Lemon spent a moment
inhaling tea vapors.
When his head
had emerged again from the steam
clouds, he said thoughtfully, “My lord
Scapula clearly has larger plans, layer
upon layer of them. Still, we could do
worse than start with the obvious, by
which I mean the Archives.”
“I thought about that,” said Leen,
“but how could he know what’s there?”
“He doesn’t have to know, all he has
to do is suspect.
It could be a move
against someone else, to preempt their

own access. He could merely want to
control whatever the Archives might
contain, or to have others know he has
his hand on whatever they think might
be buried in your stacks.” He hesitated.
“That’s not where the real concern may
lie, though. Did Grandpa ever tell you
about an incident about, oh, ten years
ago?”
“Concerning the Scapula?”
“Now I wonder. Grandpa had a sus-
picion - no, that’s too strong, more of a
hunch - that someone had gotten into
the Archives.”
“Inside the Archives? Are you seri-
ous - and why’d he tell you? Why didn’t
he tell me?”
“He didn’t want to bother you; he
was very protective of you, you know.
He knew he was getting a bit absent-
minded, too, and he thought it could
have just been something he’d mislaid.

And, well, if there was something go-
ing on, he thought my talents, such as
they are, might be suited for ferreting
it out.”
“Why didn’t he tell me later on? Why
didn’t he leave some note in the jour-
nals?”
“You’re
getting
sidetracked,”
the
Crawﬁsh said mildly. “Grandpa wouldn’
like that, you know.”
Leen closed her eyes and forced her-
self to relax.
Breathe in, hold, hold,
then out. “All right,” she said. “What
made him have this hunch, and what
did you ﬁnd out?”
“He was researching some stuff from
the equipment stacks. Mostly jewelry,
but a few small appliances that he
thought might have been related as
well.
He’d been moving a number of
boxes around the way he often did, and
had things spread out on his work ta-

bles, and had been rummaging around
quite a lot if you want to know the
truth. When he came in one morning
he thought some of the pieces might
have been moved, and some might
have actually gone missing.
“He said none of the defenses had
been triggered, although the access log
was a bit more vague about his own
comings and goings than he thought it
should have been. He reset the wards
and never noticed anything again.
I
nosed around but didn’t come up with
a thing.”
Leen tried to make herself switch
back from being appalled to being ana-
lytical. She could do it, she knew she
could - even though the thought that
someone could make it through the
defenses and into the Archives them-
selves was appalling. It was probably
worse than a typical woman would feel

if she found out someone had been pok-
ing around her bedroom. “If someone
did know how to get in and out you’d
think they should be smart enough not
to leave traces inside,” she said.
“That’s what I thought too.
Of
course, if they spotted something out
on the table they just had to have they
might have just picked it up and risked
the consequences. They could have wa-
gered Grandpa would decide he had
mislaid it, if he even realized it was
missing.”
“But you never found any evidence.
It could have been Grandfather getting
confused in the dark.”
“It could,” Lemon admitted.
“Won-
dering why the Scapula could be inter-
ested in the Archives brought the inci-
dent back to memory, though. If there
really was an intruder, the Scapula
could have heard about it one way or

another. And if the intruder had seen
something the Scapula might want to
ﬁt into his plans ...
Anyway, it does
make you wonder.”
“So you think 1 should give him the
boot.”
“I didn’t say that, did I? You might
want to play along with him and try to
ﬁgure out his game. You might even
enjoy yourself while you’re at it; I hear
he’s quite worthwhile for a girl to be
around, hm?”
“You get this from unimpeachable
sources, no doubt.”
The Crawﬁsh raised his eyebrows.
“How did you know?
No, really, his
scandals are common enough gossip.”
“Scandals?”
“Affairs, anyway. Well, and a few out-
and-out scandals too. There’s a family
curse as well, I expect you know about
that.”

“Something involving an evil sister?”
She did recall something of the sort.
Family curses were so commonplace
in their circles that it was scarcely
worth considering, of course.
Any-
way, Lemon’s suggestion was the ma-
jor thing on her mind, that she go
along with The Scapula.
She could
do that, but that wasn’t all, by any
means. She could recheck the Archive
alarms.
She’d supplemented the de-
fenses herself; anyone who tried to get
in now would ﬁnd more to contend with
than ten years ago. She could go back
through Grandfather’s logs.
There
was no chance the Scapula could have
learned of her own discovery, the an-
cient artifact in the hidden room; her
defense against mind-probe was quite
adequate. It might not be a bad idea
to practice her defenses anyway, and
perhaps even think about an upgrade.

And she could worry. She could do
quite a lot of that.

Chapter11
“MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
A BOAT,” muttered Max.
“I don’t think it would have helped,”
Jurtan said. He pointed over the side
of the bridge toward the surface of the
Tongue Water. “Look down there. We
wouldn’t have needed a boat at all; we
could have just hopped from deck to
deck.”
“That’s a local saying, an old wives’
tale.”

“That doesn’t mean it couldn’t be
done. I mean, look at it.”
“Look at the trafﬁc up here instead,”
Max said. “If you don’t keep your head
down and keep pushing ahead you’re
gonna get dragged backward.
Watch
out for the horse, too, if you don’t want
it stolen right out of your grasp.”
“I’ve never seen a crowd like this in
my life.”
“It is pretty extreme,” Max admitted.
“Are you enjoying yourself now?”
“I guess,” said Jurtan. But it was ex-
citing - this was Peridol, after all, and
at last. Even if it had taken them all
day just to struggle from Yenemsvelt
to this bridge.
And they’d used back
roads, too.
What they’d already seen of Peridol,
on the landward side coming in, hadn’t
been too impressive, unless you liked
grime and the reek of danger.
Even

through Max’s best efforts on the road
to acquaint him with these pleasures,
both of them were still way down on
Jurtan’s list of preferences. The city so
far had been impressive mainly since
it was clearly big, though, but not big
enough by half to cope with everyone
who wanted to be there.
Then there had been the checkpoint
they’d just passed at the base of the
bridge, with the police and the search
ﬁeld.
A modulation of Jurtan’s mu-
sic, and the use of a particular trom-
bone theme that he’d come to associate
with warnings, had alerted him to the
magical sensor system.
Max had al-
ready deactivated his own onboard
defenses and countermeasures, saying
they could draw too much attention,
but he’d added a comment to Jurtan
about his music sense being a handy
thing to have around.
For a change

Max had actually briefed Jurtan in ad-
vance, on protective coloration, in the
course of getting them outﬁtted with
their disguises.
“Think like the face-
less crowd,” Max had said, but Jurtan
hadn’t had to take any special action
to accomplish that. The crowd was so
big that he felt about the size of a sand
grain on a beach.
In any event, it had worked. They’d
made it through the checkpoint with-
out incident.
Of course, surely the
checkpoint hadn’t had anything to do
with them.
Had it?
Jurtan thought
it was worth braving the changeable
moods of Max to ask.
“Could be,” said Max. “That’s usually
the best way to plan.”
“As if anything that happens is
aimed speciﬁcally at you?”
“Yeah, that’s right. When you’ve got
as many people who could be after you

as I do, yeah, that’s right.”
Of
course,
Max’s
obvious
broad
streak of paranoia wasn’t news.
Even so, they were still alive, and
they’d made it to Peridol.
And Jur-
tan’s music was still urging him on.
More than that, Jurtan thought it was
telling him some kind of payoff might
be up ahead.
What the music wasn’t telling him
was how to behave. It hadn’t seem to
object before, though, when he’d tried
to be more assertive. Well, Max’s mood
seemed as good as it got. Maybe it was
time to try being pushy again.
Jurtan cleared his throat, weaved
around a farmer with a brace of ﬂap-
ping chickens slung over each shoulder
who was following a cart similarly
equipped, then launched into it. “Now
that we’re here, what are we going to
do?
What are you going to do?
No,

wait. You and Shaa have been trying
to teach me to be analytic and method-
ical, right? Why don’t we try some of
that, shall we?”
To Max, what was apparent above
all was that he and Shaa had suc-
ceeded in creating a monster.
Of
course, that wasn’t to say a monster
couldn’t be useful to have around. The
problem was one of control, and giving
the creature something interesting to
focus on so it didn’t get bored and head
off to ravage the countryside.
Something interesting to focus on
was Max’s immediate intention. They
were nearing one. It was somewhere
around here. In that neighborhood at
the end of the bridge, certainly.
Off
to the right? No, Max decided, maybe
straight ahead.
“You’ve got two major goals, as I
see it,” Jurtan was continuing. “Three,

if you count driving people around
you crazy because you don’t want to
communicate with them as a goal, in-
stead of just a habit. But it’s the other
two that are more important anyway.
First, you want to overthrow the gods,
mainly because they want to keep on
running the world and keeping people
from having free will, and second, you
want to get the curse off the Shaas’
back. Or should that be the other way
around?”
They came off the bridge onto a
street lined with middle-of-the-road
shops and the occasional block-wide
emporium. Street vendors were largely
absent, although their lack was more
than compensated for by the presence
of barkers and strolling hucksters in
the pay of the local merchants. None
of the food purveyors or open-pit bar-
becues they’d seen on the other side of

the bridge were visible, yet the faint
aroma of roast mutton snaked down
the street in front of them.
“You hoped you could pick up some-
thing from Iskendarian that would
help you on both the god and the Shaa
problems,” said Jurtan.
“You did get
those papers but you haven’t been able
to ﬁnd what’s in them. You might still
get lucky but you have to plan that you
won’t.
“You’re running out of time, too, on
Shaa anyway.
Now that he’s in Peri-
dol he can’t leave unless something
gets done about the curse.
Shaa’s
brother’s around here somewhere too,
and he might have something new up
his sleeve. But you haven’t shown any
sign of a plan. Now, I know better than
that. Just because you haven’t told me
about it doesn’t mean you don’t have a
plan. Of course you have a plan. The

question is whether you’re going to tell
me about.”
“That’s not a bad analysis, kid,” Max
said grudgingly. “The Iskendarian con-
nection was always a long shot but it’s
still worth playing out. The thing you
got to remember, though, is that you
can ﬁnd most anything right here, in
Peridol. That gives you a lot to work
with.”
The kid was getting sharp. As good
as his skills might be growing, though,
he had no experience in paradigm
shifts.
That was more than just as
well. Max didn’t want anyone to get a
line on the course he was considering.
They might not like it.
In fact, they
probably wouldn’t like it at all.
Which didn’t mean it didn’t need
to be done. What was clear, however,
was the same thing that was always
clear, the importance of secrecy and

misdirection. Even more than usually,
it would be important not to telegraph
his plans.
“What’s that?” said Jurtan. He had
stopped in the middle of the street, his
head cocked to one side and his eyes
squinting in puzzlement.
“What’s what?” Max sniffed surrepti-
tiously; the odor of burning lamb was
still there, if you were looking for it,
but there was still not a lamb in sight.
“I hear something strange. I mean,
stranger than normal.” Jurtan started
forward again, haltingly.
Max
followed,
giving
him
room.
“Can you describe what you’re expe-
riencing?
Is it different in character
from your typical cues, or does it seem
to have some kind of unusual mean-
ing?”
“It’s like . . . it’s like ...” Jurtan was
clearly diverting so much of his atten-

tion to whatever he was concentrating
on that he didn’t have enough left to
communicate intelligibly.
It was also
clear, though, that his slightly weaving
path was holding precisely to the mean-
dering aroma trail of cooking lamb. Ju-
rtan wasn’t inhaling the scent, at least
on any higher than a subliminal level,
but he did seem to have picked up the
Track.
Not that there was anything partic-
ularly subtle about one leg of a Track.
Most of the trick was in the transitions.
There should be one coming up soon.
And unless Max missed his guess it
would be -
A cat yowled. Where was it, left or
right? Neither? Both?
Jurtan had stopped.
His head
swiveled right.
He walked in that
direction,
head-ﬁrst,
stumbling,
re-
ally, as though an invisible string was

drawing him by his outthrust nose.
The smell of mutton was gone now, too,
another characteristic of a successful
transition, as much due to the shift in
attention to the next leg as anything
else, Max had found, but another clue
to which you needed to pay strict atten-
tion. Jurtan was still tottering forward,
and in another two paces was going to
plow at reasonable speed into the stone
wall of the ironwork shop on the corner,
but then all at once an old war-shield
mounted on the clapboard sign of an
inn a block ahead caught the setting
sun in a sharp orange glint. Jurtan’s
head tracked around to face it, the rest
of his body followed, and again he was
off.
Two transitions almost on top of
each other. That was a sign of a rea-
sonably high-level track; certainly not
something a beginner should be able

to traverse at all. If it held to form, the
next leg might appear to submerge -
and indeed, underneath the inn’s sign
Jurtan stalled out.
Max thought he
made the perfect image of a tracking
hound, excepting only the long lolling
tongue.
“What do you think you’re
doing?” Max said.
“You’re not going to distract me,” Ju-
rtan stated.
“Fine,” said Max. “Distract you from
what?”
“I thought I was, ah, following ...
you’re not going to get on my case, on
you?”
“Probably not,” Max allowed.
“It was like a trail, then,” said Jur-
tan. “The music was keying me onto
it.”
“Close your eyes and concentrate.”
Jurtan turned slowly in a circle, his
eyes screwed shut and his nose pointed

into the air. Then his head swung back
around more rapidly, swung back and
forth in increasingly short arcs, and ﬁ-
nally came to rest. He opened his eyes
and squinted in confusion. “Why would
I want to go back in the same direction
we came from?” he asked. “What kind
of sense does that make?”
“Doubleback loops are a pretty com-
mon trick.”
“Oh,” said Jurtan, “okay then.” He
started forward, then ground to a halt,
one foot in the air. “Wait a minute.”
“Overlaying multiple back-and-forth
legs makes it difﬁcult to tease them
apart,” Max explained.
“Something
else
that
separates
out
beginners
from the Pseudonyms on higher-order
Tracks.” Except where you’re concerned,
Max thought to himself, all rules may
be off.
“No, don’t stop; tracks decay,
you know.”

“You mean there really is some kind
of trail here?”
Max urged the horse after Jurtan.
“You’ve heard of the Society of Masks,
right?”
“Uh, yeah, sort of. My father doesn’t
much hold with them. First he said it
was a myth, and then he said it was
nothing but a bunch of wimps skulking
around in the dark trying to stay out of
a fair ﬁght.”
“Your father is a man with no short-
age of opinions,” Max told Jurtan. “Es-
pecially, in this case, for someone who,
unless I miss my guess, is at least Alias
level in the Society himself.”
“But I thought the Society of Masks
was a secret.”
“Membership is a secret,” Max said,
“and so are activities, for the most part.
Your father’s quite right, actually. Like
most secret societies, a lot of the Soci-

ety is quite childish, really.”
“If it’s such a secret, I can under-
stand why my father didn’t want me
asking questions.” And of course he is
my father, after all, Jurtan added un-
der his voice. The Lion never wanted
Jurtan to ask much of anything. Espe-
cially in public, when he usually tried
as hard as possible to make people
think Jurtan was certainly no offspring
of his. Jurtan swerved aside, elbowed
his way across the street, and plunged
down a sudden alley, where the sound
of an internal yaphorn harmonized
intriguingly with the scent of osten-
tatiously baking bread.
Max glanced
around.
Half a block up the street a
woman was staring at him.
Did he
know her? He didn’t think so, and any-
way he was in disguise. You had to be
a fool to trust a disguise, of course - but
if the woman saw something in him it

would be good to ﬁnd out what it was.
She looked -
But the kid was forging ahead; he
had to follow. The other was no more
than a distraction, even if - No! Max
told himself. Business was afoot. “If
this Society is a secret,” the kid was
saying, Max thought for the second
time, “why are you telling me about
it?”
“I thought I might as well, seeing as
you’ve decided to become an initiate.”
“An - oh! - really?”
“Don’t stop,” Max instructed.
“You
were quite right to tell me not to dis-
tract you; ability to focus on your intu-
ition is a central skill. It isn’t called the
Intuition Track for nothing.”
“But what’s the point?
Where do
these Tracks come from?
Is it just
some kind of treasure hunt, or what?”
“Sometimes
there’s
treasure,
but

that’s pretty rare actually.
Usually
it’s just the directions to a meeting, or
some Society member showing off.”
Jurtan stopped in his tracks again.
“So it is just a waste of time. It’s just
some game.
Why make all this fuss
over -”
“You play chess?” Max said.
“Ever
seen a crossword puzzle?
There’s al-
most never such a thing as ‘just some
game.’ Even if there is, it can still be
part of something larger, or something
you can turn into something larger.
You got to be open to possibilities. Just
go with it and see where it takes you.”
Jurtan was moving. Actually, it had
been hard for him to stay still.
Max
considered mentioning how addictive
Track-running could be, but it would
have clearly been superﬂuous. As Max
had, well, intuited, Jurtan not only
had the talent, he’d gotten the hook.

Except Jurtan’s talent wasn’t the
straight-out typical route of intuition
and instinct. However his music sense
was wired, it had given him a super-
charge boost straight to the upper
levels.
“But what is the Society of Masks,
then, anyway?” Jurtan asked. “I mean,
is it just, like, a puzzle-solving club?”
“It’s got its puzzle side, and its debat-
ing and wit-matching and skill-honing
side, and its exclusive honoriﬁc side,
but like most private clubs it’s an im-
portant place to meet important peo-
ple.”
“People?”
“Yeah,
people,
gods,
others,
you
name it.”
“Is the Society why you came to Peri-
dol?”
“It’s one reason.
The running for
Mask Supreme should shake loose

some folks I’d like to get in touch with.”
Jurtan kept glancing up at the top
of the buildings they were passing.
They were three stories high, and had
peaked, ill-shingled roofs, but he had
an unpleasant feeling that this Track-
thing was going to try to lead him up
there.
What would they do with the
horse?
“Where does the Mask part
come into it?”
“It’s like this,” expounded Max. “Ba-
sically we’re talking about a secret
society of folks who use disguises as
part of their normal activities; primar-
ily thieves, gods, and adventurers, but
also spies, diplomats, and so forth. It’s
based primarily around the ﬂaunting
of one’s ability and the courting of dis-
aster through the danger of discovery.
The higher up you get, the less you
really know the true identities of any
of the other members at any gathering,

and since everybody typically changes
their disguise or persona from time to
time anyway it’s also difﬁcult to tell if
you’re even meeting the same person
twice.”
“But my father doesn’t wear dis-
guises,” Jurtan protested.
“It’s a loose deﬁnition; the disguise
may be physical or it may not. Magical
subterfuge and emotional prevarica-
tion aren’t excluded. In fact, although
no one really likes to come right out
and admit it, anyone who can gain
access to the Society of Masks is eligi-
ble for membership, ipso facto. Since
no one really knows who anyone else
really is, or at least each person tries
to keep everyone else from ﬁnding out,
what are you going to do, anyway, bar
the door?”
“What
about
this
ranking
stuff,
then? Is it just a pecking order?”

“It’s more than that, there’s a hierar-
chy. If you get right down to it, the So-
ciety amounts to the social register of
skullduggery, the who’s-who’s of schem-
ing.”
“All it sounds like is a place to show
off,” Jurtan said.
“There is that,” acknowledged Max.
They rounded a corner and weaved
their way down a new street. Up ahead
at the end of the block was a large open
space free of buildings. The Track led
straight toward it - a market plaza,
thronged with people. At the far side,
the business of the bazaar was pro-
ceeding apparently as normal.
Even
though night had pretty much fallen,
torches and wizard lamps gave enough
illumination to keep things alive.
In
the area closer to them, though, the
section surrounding some kind of mon-
ument had been cordoned off by police.

The monument itself glowed in the
harsh white glare of a high-intensity
arcﬁre ﬁeld. People were hanging back
and looking on in a hum of speculative
conversation.
Jurtan had ground to a halt in mid-
stride. He was looking around in con-
fusion. “It’s gone,” said Jurtan. “Where
is it? I’ve lost it.”
“You were right the ﬁrst time,” Max
told him, gazing around the plaza him-
self.
“It is gone, been cut.
A Track
that dives through a place like this is
another trick to separate out the peo-
ple who really know what they’re do-
ing. This kind of place - a market, a
public assembly, anything big and hec-
tic - has so many conﬂicting stimuli it
can be next to impossible to follow a
Track built on subtlety through it. This
one would have been High Pseudonym
class at least.”

“So why are you so sure the Track
was cut?
Couldn’t you have just lost
it?”
“At my rating a High Pseudonym is
a warm-up exercise,” Max said distract-
edly. “What the hell happened to that
thing over there?”
“That thing” was the closed-off mon-
ument.
Actually, as they approached
the area, the monument had revealed
itself to be a fountain, now shut off
and in the process of being drained.
The equestrian statue standing off-
center in the pool, its horse reclining
in the water and the heroically propor-
tioned general leaning far off to one
side with his sword extended, was be-
ing shored up with wood scaffolding.
A section of the general’s stone arm
had already pulled apart from its own
weight. “Kind of a strange way to build
a statue, isn’t it?” asked Jurtan.

“It wasn’t built that way,” Max told
him, examining it speculatively, his ﬁn-
gers making passes at his side. “Some-
body animated it, but it got shut down
partway through its sequence. What-
ever else was going on, the emanations
also managed to override the Track.”
“Look at this,” Jurtan said, point-
ing to the side. A row of large posters
had been ﬂung up on the wall of a
building facing the plaza. Rancid glue
was still running down the wall, and a
disreputable-looking landau was clat-
tering surreptitiously away from the
site.
“Broadsiders,” said Max.
“Another
quaint local business custom.” The
posters themselves, fresh off an unli-
censed clairvogravure press shop, no
doubt, showed the statue behind them,
in the best emblematic Heroic Realism
style.
Around the fountain a ring of

ﬁre spelled out words of incitement
and revolution. The statue was strik-
ing a pose, its sword in the air. Next
to it, at its feet inside the fountain, in
fact, a more human-sized ﬁgure was
matching its pose. Suddenly Max gave
a start. “Let’s get a closer look at this,”
he muttered.
Jurtan trailed him to the wall. Now
that the sun was down,
the light
reaching the posters was slim.
That
could have been the reason the poster-
splashers had picked that spot for
their handiwork; they could emplace
in peace at night and have the city
blanketed by the light of morning.
Max glanced around,
making sure
they were more-or-less alone, and then
made a less subtle series of passes in
the air.
Jurtan heard a faint strand
of the melody that meant magic was
being unleashed, not that he needed

the extra clue. A glowing orb the size
of a tennis ball spun into existence
and rolled over to hover in front of the
poster. The features of the man at the
foot of the statue, brandishing a sword
swathed in a cloud of ﬁre, were now
clearly visible.
“I guess he’s in town too,” Jurtan
said, eyeing the portrait of the Creep-
ing Sword.
“But what’s he doing up
there on that poster?”
“Damned if I know,” said Max, “ex-
cept no good, there’s no doubt about
that.”
“So,” said a new voice, “quite a little
dust-up here, wouldn’t you say?”
Another man was standing next to
them, scrutinizing the poster along
with them in the glow of Max’s ﬂoat-
ing lamp.
The man had blond hair
that straggled across his forehead with
a devil-may-care insouciance, and be-

neath it a dashing mustache. An ear-
ring glinted in his left ear. “The way
the man and the statue are matching
poses is rather an artistic touch, don’t
you think?” the fellow added.
Where have I seen this guy before?
Jurtan wondered. He looked unfamil-
iar, but Jurtan was convinced this was
not the ﬁrst time he’d heard the voice.
“Do you know what the story was with
this?” Max asked the newcomer.
“Or
did you maybe have something to do
with it yourself?”
“All I have is hearsay, sad to tell,”
said the man, making a pouting face
to match. “Whatever did happen, this
fellow -” he tapped the picture of the
Creeping Sword “- has rather a talent
for showing up in interesting spots,
though, eh? Almost as much as you,”
he added.
“Oh, yeah?” said Max. “Has he been

hanging around with you now?”
The fellow considered the question.
“No,” he said, “and yes. It was some-
what of a chance thing, actually, which
is to say we were thrown together so-
cially, so to speak.
I went up to him
and did some small talk, tried to make
him feel at home.”
“What kind of social occasion are we
talking about here?”
“One of these conclave things.
It
wasn’t exactly clear what he was do-
ing there, but since the folks he was
with obviously thought he was some-
one else, I thought it best to play along
with them. Who is he, really?”
“I was hoping you were going to tell
me that, especially since he’s your new
pal.”
“There’s no need to get testy. Tem-
perament is rather a problem for you,
isn’t it?”

“I’m glad you’re on my side,” Max
said sarcastically. “But since you were
on my side at last report, I’ll ask you
again, you weasel.”
“Who he is, you mean?
Someone
interesting, as I said.
Beyond that?”
He shrugged.
“More interesting all
the time, though, especially now he’s
gotten tangled up with these terror-
ists.
Potentially rather a dangerous
lot, these terrorist chaps. Or as I like
to think of them, freedom ﬁghters. Not
all that different from you, in their own
way, eh?” The man sighed. “I suppose
it’s something of an occupational haz-
ard, me gravitating toward this sort of
bunch I mean, but what else can I do,
really? It’s what I am.”
“Terrorists?” Max said.
“Out to
maim civilians? Now they’re your kind
of people too?”
The dapper man draped an arm over

Max’s shoulder. “No, no, no, you’re fo-
cusing in the wrong place. Yes, when
you put it that way I suppose they need
a bit more discipline, more concern for
niceties, but still they’re acting out in
rather a swashbuckling style, wouldn’t
you say? Clearly they’re projecting a
one-against-the-many, individual-over-
the-forces-of-the-state attitude; you if
anyone should appreciate that. It’s one
of the things that drew me to you after
all.”
“But terrorists?” Max said dubiously.
“Come on. Do you have some quota to
meet?”
“Nothing hard and fast. As patron
of adventurers, though, I suppose I do
need to keep my hand in.”
Patron of adventurers? Jurtan though
Wait a minute - did that mean this in-
dividual was really -
“Pardon me,” said the man, turning

his ﬂashing smile in Jurtan’s direction.
“I haven’t formally met your friend,
Max.”
“Jurtan Mont,” Max said, “meet -”
“Phlinn
Arol?”
sputtered
Jurtan.
“The Adventurers’ God?”
“Has someone been talking about
me behind my back?” said Phlinn Arol.
“Charmed, I’m sure.” He executed a
neat bow, managing to sweep his sword
neatly out of the way on the way down
so that it didn’t bash against his leg,
in a manner that Jurtan had thus far
totally failed to master for himself.
Phlinn certainly had the style down, at
any rate, even if he did rattle on more
Jurtan had expected from the avatar
of action.
But now Jurtan had remembered
where he’d heard this voice before. “I’m
charmed too,” Jurtan said, popping a
quick bow himself and then straighten-

ing right up before any of them could
slip away. “But we’ve met before. Al-
most, that is.
You visited Max while
we were on the road, after we’d left
Roosing Oolvaya. In the middle of the
night when you thought I was asleep.”
Phlinn Arol raised an eyebrow at
Max.
“Letting your friends sneak up
on you now?” he said. “The start of a
bad habit, if you ask me. And you al-
ways act so concerned about perimeter
security, too.”
“My mistake,” said Max, glaring at
Jurtan. “But not my worst, either.”
“No,” said Phlinn, “that’s true. But
you’re working on others. Who knows
what you’ll be able to come up with?”
“I’d be happy to discuss it with you,”
Max said.
“Capital idea, yes, but no, not now,
I’m running late as it is, and certainly
not here. Your other associate is get-

ting rather a bit skittish, it would
seem.” The horse had been whimpering
and wrinkling its nose at the posters,
and their still dripping glue, and was
now dancing nervously around at the
end of its bridle. “He has the right idea.
He knows when to move on.
You’re
not the only one who wants my time,
you know, even if you are always one
of the more stimulating.
I’m at the
Adventurers’ Club, where else?
Pop
round and see me.” He coiled his cloak
around and headed off.
“What about -” Max hissed after him.
Phlinn stopped.
“Oh, by the way,
the Intuition Track went off that way,”
he said, waving vaguely across the
plaza,
“but you might as well not
bother trying to pick it up now.
The
only Pseudonym who showed up was
the one who laid the Track, and they
gave up and left after this lot happened

here.”
“Which Pseudonym?” Max said quickl
“Who was it?”
“I hear the Pseudonym was the Ta-
ble.
As far as the being behind the
alias, I certainly couldn’t say.”
“Couldn’t or wouldn’t?” Max mut-
tered.
“Well, I suppose it was worth
asking.”
“Catch you later, then,” said Phlinn
Arol.
He turned and began to van-
ish into the night, then paused again,
added, “Keep an eye on your friend,”
in a cryptic over-the-shoulder remark,
and strode quickly away.
“Which friend?” said Max.
“Gods.
Damn the bunch of them.”
But Jurtan wasn’t listening, Max no-
ticed. His head was canted to one side
and his face had glazed with concentra-
tion. “What is it?” Max said sharply.
“Watch out?” Jurtan mumbled.
“I

think.”
“Where?” Max spun around, putting
the wall at his back. His sword had ap-
peared in his hand.
But no one was heading in their di-
rection. No arrows were in ﬂight, no
spells were in progress, no creatures
were on the loose. Could it be a false
alarm? Only, Jurtan’s music sense had
been reliable so far. What about -
Jurtan’s head was craning upward.
A dark shape was visible overhead in
the murky light, a dark expanding
shape, in fact a shape that was expand-
ing because it was hurtling downward
toward them -
Jurtan’s teeth came together with
a hard clack as Max thrust him away
from the wall and dove after him. Jur-
tan sprawled on the cobblestones; Max
rolled, a little more awkwardly than
he liked, but came to his feet anyway,

crouched and ready for further maneu-
vers, as the dark shape became a large
chimney and then, as it plowed into
the ground where they’d been stand-
ing, an exploding burst of masonry and
hurtling fragments of bricks.
A brick caught Max in the chest and
sent him over backward again. After
a moment of judicious ground-hugging,
then, and the end of the crunch and
clatter of debris, he once again got to
his feet. The horse, with more foresight
than either Max or Jurtan, had already
edged aside away from the impact zone;
now it stood eyeing Max with a look of
some bemusement.
Jurtan was brushing himself off too.
“I guess I’d better get used to this kind
of stuff,” he muttered. “Was that some-
thing aimed at us?”
“Don’t even bother to ask,” Max said
disgustedly.
“Damned if I know any

more.”
“I mean, is dropping a chimney on
someone a hallmark of somebody you
know? Like that steerhorn thing?”
“Nah, it’s just sort of a classic, every-
body does it occasionally. Maybe it was
an accident.”
“Right,” said Jurtan.
“Sure.
I
thought you told me accidents didn’t
just happen, they were made.”
“Sometimes an accident is just an ac-
cident. There’s always fate.”
“Okay, ﬁne. Have it your way.”
“Don’t worry,” Max told him. It was
just as well the kid didn’t know about
Ma Pitom. Ma was an absolute ﬁend
for lurking on rooftops and shoving off
decorative trim, the odd cornice and
the occasional gargoyle. Of course, the
local roofers’ and builders’ guilds loved
him. He left them a lot of work to do.
But if that had been Homar Kalifa

back in the woods with the steerhorn,
and if this had been Ma Pitom, and
knowing that had certainly been The
Hand
off
in
Iskendarian’s
swamp,
there was a larger question at hand.
What could be bringing all these old
sparring partners out of the woodwork
all at once?

Chapter12
“THINGS ARE GETTING TO BE
A FINE MUDDLE, there’s no two
ways about that,” commented Zalzyn
Shaa.
He was speaking to no one in
particular, or from a slightly different
perspective to the world at large, prom-
enading as he was down the Grand
Boulevard
in
the
heart
of
Peridol
amidst the omnipresent crowds.
As
muddled as things might be, there was
still a good deal of story left to run for

each of his fellow players, no doubt.
Shaa’s main hope at the moment was
that he would be around to see his full
share of denouements, and not be cut
short by time, space, or the action of
unknowable forces. There was only so
much power one had to inﬂuence the
meta-plane.
And the currents of the marketplace,
when it comes to it, Shaa observed,
eyeing the display of rich fabrics dis-
played beneath wizard-lights in the
shop-window he was passing; linen,
cashmere,
angora;
purple argaman
and sharkskin.
Come to think of it,
he probably needed a new outﬁt, es-
pecially if he was intending to reenter
the social whirl. Although it might be
better to wait.
Shaa hadn’t yet gone
through all the closets, and it was pos-
sible his sister had already provided
some suitably baroque gear for the

occasion.
Of course, Shaa thought, the inquir-
ing mind might wonder why, beset as
he was on all sides by curses, brothers,
annoying gods, and menaces of other
assorted sorts, the foremost considera-
tion at hand was the social scene and
what to wear for it.
But one might
equally ask what good an inquiring
mind is, anyway, if all it does is bring
one to such a situation in the ﬁrst
place.
Now that he had encountered
at ﬁrst hand and face-to-face the Ad-
ministrator of Curses himself, of all
the luck, there was clearly no purpose
to be served by skulking around try-
ing to assume an incognito, or moping
around his digs either for that matter.
On the other hand, he had forgotten
the effect Peridol had on one’s spirits
and general outlook. It was probably
unfair to blame Peridol for the fruitless

excursions of the day, but then he was
feeling in a rather unfair mood. Shaa
doubted that the sect that promoted
the Law of Conservation of Karma
would appreciate his current applica-
tion of it, where being stubborn and
unfair to something in no position to
ﬁght back actually made him feel a bit
better, but there it was. No one ever
said the sect business was easy, either.
Not that Shaa had expected any-
thing good to come of his earlier er-
rands.
Still, good practice required
that one go through the motions. He
had visited several medical practition-
ers, one already familiar with his case
and another a specialist in magically-
inﬂicted chronic syndromes and curse-
hooks. Their frustration at having no
treatment for his condition, even an
experimental one, was exceeded only
by their pleasant expectation of being

able to write up his case, and of course
by the remunerative glow of his cash-
on-the-table payment of fee. The cash
may have been one thing, the case
report was quite another; Shaa had
left his own fully documented write-up
among his effects. A Guide for Those
Who May Follow, and all that.
On the other hand, Fah! He would
have settled for a cure.
Those hadn’t been the only practi-
tioners he’d visited, of course.
The
others had exhibited a tendency to lock
their doors, drop their shutters, and
sneak out the back as soon as they
smelled him coming.
Shaa had man-
aged to catch one in the alley making
his escape, but then that didn’t nec-
essarily argue in favor of the fellow’s
competence either.
In the event, the
man had merely conﬁrmed that Shaa
was bearing a major curse before faint-

ing dead away.
Consulting sorcerers obviously weren
what they used to be.
Not that Grand Rounds at the Thau-
maturgical Guild, or even the Univer-
sity, had been much more of a help. No
one wanted to tamper with the handi-
work of a god like the Curse Adminis-
trator, especially while he was in town
and had already staked out his victim
face-to-face.
And then there was his
brother, too; no one was eager to go up
against him, either.
Which left the unseen byways. And,
of course, Max. Max was acting more
unseen and inscrutable himself these
days, enough to make one question his
methods, if not his sanity. Shaa’s ﬁnal
homily to Jurtan Mont back in Roos-
ing Oolvaya had actually helped to
focus the issue in Shaa’s mind. Jurtan
had slunk up to him just before set-

ting forth with Max, as nervous as he
usually was when bringing up a poten-
tially touchy subject. Shaa could tell
the thoughts going through Jurtan’s
mind; Shaa was supposedly Max’s best
buddy.
Would Shaa be upset at Jur-
tan for complaining about him?
On
the other hand, Jurtan had seen Shaa
argue with Max too.
“What’s Max’s
problem, anyway?” Jurtan had opened
with, tentatively.
“Which particularly problem are we
discussing here?”
“His attitude, I guess.
He always
seems mad I’m around. He treats me
like I’m an idiot.
He doesn’t tell me
what’s going on or what he’s doing.
Okay, some of that I can take; he’s try-
ing to teach me to ﬁgure things out on
my own, ﬁne. But how am I supposed
to ﬁgure out exactly what part I’m sup-
posed to play in some plan he’s cooked

up when he doesn’t even say there is a
plan?”
“Max is a loner to the point of clin-
ical pathology,” Shaa had told him, a
bit surprised to hear the statement
coming from his own mouth. “He can
be a total pain in the neck more often
than even he realizes. It’s really quite
obnoxious. He’s good at what he does,
though.” Or at least he used to be, Shaa
had added, under his voice. Max was
starting to complicate things out of any
bounds of rational necessity. When you
thought about it, these were rather
disturbing signs.
On the other hand, what did it re-
ally matter, anyway? Shaa had enough
objectivity to recognize how far he was
sliding into ennui, but the undertow of
apathy was enough to make him not ex-
actly care. What point was there in get-
ting rid of the gods, after all?
Max’s

longtime goal would just shift the prob-
lems of life onto another playing ﬁeld;
it wouldn’t necessarily solve anything.
In fact, Shaa was aware he hadn’t had
a major goal in some time other than
just staying alive. Now, back in Peri-
dol, in the midst of his youthful haunts,
there was some question whether that
was even a worthwhile goal.
He was passing another row of bou-
tiques, one here for perfumes and rare
scents, another there for furs, wraps,
and mufﬂers torn from the backs of en-
dangered species. When you thought
about it, it was amazing how quickly
you could sink back into old habits,
even ones you’d thought you’d rejected
and had deliberately ﬂed from.
The
attitude of studied disdain that could
make one bemoan the loss of life and
natural resources involved in making
a fur coat while simultaneously pa-

tronizing the nearest salon was char-
acteristic of the Peridol aristocracy.
Shaa, as a young rebel about town,
had speechiﬁed in the coffeehouses
against the legacy of his class, and
its tendency to reduce all the excesses
and pleasures of life to banality. Fine
foods, rich surroundings, ostentatious
dinner parties followed by discrete bed-
hopping - unfortunately, it was a life he
could probably slide back into without
a hitch.
But that would bring along
with it the effete languor that shaved
off the highs and lows and left one
ﬂoundering mindlessly in a sybaritic
haze.
What he needed was a project, a fo-
cus.
Well, there was the Creeping Sword.
Like Shaa, the Sword had some serious
problems, apparently related to magic
and the gods, that Max had decided to

help him with. The Sword also shared
Shaa’s doubts about how liberally and
widely Max might interpret his self-
appointed mission.
When the Sword
had come to Shaa aboard ship, it had
been because he wasn’t sure he could
talk honestly with Max; they’d never
hit it off right, and furthermore the
Sword thought Max might represent
a threat or become an adversary once
the whole story, whatever it was, be-
gan to come out. In the Sword’s way
of thinking, Karlini was too far out to
lunch to help, and wasn’t terribly well-
grounded in the real world to start
out with. But the Sword didn’t know
how much longer he could manage his
balancing act solo. Deciding he needed
someone smart and savvy in his corner,
he’d elected Shaa.
Shaa turned off the boulevard onto a
tree-shaded avenue faced on both sides

by elegantly colonnaded townhouses.
Where was that key? - oh, there it was,
just where it was supposed to be, in
his pocket. The Sword had hoped for a
useful slant on Max. In the course of
thinking about the Sword’s situation
and Max’s place in it, though, Shaa
had ended up in a grudging reexam-
ination of his own relationship with
Max.
It - hmm.
Shaa eyed the key
in his hand. One of Max’s trademark
gimmicks throughout the years they’d
known each other was his habit of
showing up in spots where he had no
reason to be.
And Shaa could always use the ex-
ercise, especially without the caloric
drain of active magic-use helping to
keep his weight in line.
Although
it had never been quite mainstream,
physical culture had long been an ac-
cepted option for the Peridol elite; this

was one thing Shaa had never quar-
reled too much with, after shaking off
the sloth of a bookish childhood.
So
why not?
Stowing the key, Shaa crossed light-
footedly to the nearest street-adjacent
tree, an oak of some stature, grabbed
the lowest branch, and swung nimbly
up.
By the time he was ensconced
in an upper branch, edging his way
out over the nearest townhouse’s front
yard, his heart rate had accelerated
dramatically, his breath had shortened
to pants broken by periodic paroxysms,
and he felt thoroughly rotten. As far as
Shaa was concerned, though, that was
no reason to lie down and give up. The
branch overhung the third-ﬂoor pedi-
ment of the townhouse. Shaa carefully
transferred his grasp on the branch to
a perch atop the pediment and strolled
off across the roof.
A small ﬂock of

starlings wheeling in for a landing
reconsidered and darted off as Shaa
reached the edge of the building.
A running leap would have once car-
ried him easily to the next townhouse
over. Under the present circumstances
he thought it might be pushing things
to risk it. He never went out without
a rope, however, and a judicious sling-
and-swing maneuver had soon taken
him across the gap, and then shortly
after that to the succeeding townhouse
as well.
His key ﬁt the lock on the
roof-door.
The landing beyond was
empty. A tall drink of water with an
anti-arrhythmic herb, followed by an
overstuffed easy chair; that was the
ticket.
The easy chair in the sitting room
on the ground ﬂoor proved to be occu-
pied, however.
“Don’t you think that
was kind of a dumb stunt?” said Max.

He gestured toward Shaa with a half-
eaten sandwich on a large sourdough
roll. “Look at you. Now you’re a mess.”
“Nice to see you again too, Maximil-
lian,” said Shaa. “If I’m such a wreck
you could give me the chair.”
“This is a comfortable chair,” Max
agreed. “Eden has good taste in furni-
ture.” He didn’t move to get up, though,
which seemed to indicate that the sofa
would have to serve as an appropriate
half-measure. Jurtan Mont appeared
from the bathroom as Shaa was mak-
ing himself comfortable in a full-length
recline, and after pleasantries and an-
other run to the kitchen for Shaa’s
anti-arrhythmic, they settled down to
compare notes.
Max and Jurtan proved to be fresh
off the streets and an abortive Track-
run. “I suppose you’re planning to stay
here, then,” said Shaa, “seeing as it’s

already getting late.”
“Lateness has nothing to do with it,”
said Max. “You’ve got plenty of room
here, and anyway Eden said to make
ourselves at home.”
“As if you’ve ever needed an invita-
tion,” Shaa grumbled, in a comment
Max, playing true to form, ignored
completely.
A perusal of the Iskendarian doc-
uments, now getting slightly ragged
from the travel in which they’d re-
cently engaged, was interesting if not
ultimately productive.
“Now am I
crazy,” Max said, waving one of the
pages at Shaa, “or is that some kind of
chain-reaction memory-wipe trigger?”
Shaa held the paper in front of
him, wrong side out, and squinted at
the transilluminated vellum.
“You’re
thinking Spell of Namelessness, aren’t
you?”

“Well, aren’t you?”
“Yes,” Shaa said cautiously, “I sup-
pose that would be a reasonable inter-
pretation. Do you have any idea what
kind of code he’s using? Aside from the
fact he’s writing backward, of course.”
“I’ve been working on it,” said Max,
“but it could take a long time. A long
time. You got any ideas?”
“Have you tried aiming Jurtan’s mu-
sic sense at it?”
“Yeah,” said Max, and “Not really,”
said Jurtan.
Max frowned at Jurtan.
“You’ve been looking at it here, haven’t
you? You haven’t had any particular in-
sights, have you?”
“Uh, no,” said Jurtan. “I guess not.”
“Perhaps there are others who could
help with the decipherment,” Shaa
tossed out.
“Maybe,” Max said. “But who can we
trust?”

“The Karlinis deserve a shot,
of
course, but of course you’ll already
have planned on that.” Shaa kept his
face furrowed in thought. Haddo might
be an interesting option, and possibly
too the Creeping Sword, but it would
perhaps be prudent not to bring them
up right at the moment. Keeping infor-
mation from Max was always a dicey
business, Shaa reminded himself, and
not to be undertaken lightly. Still, Max
was not the only one around who had
occasion to practice deception.
Shaa had known him a long time,
too; long enough to know how his mind
worked. “There is one obvious recourse
at hand,” Shaa ventured.
“The Iskendarian shelf in the Archive
Max stated. “With or without Iskendar-
ian, it’s time for a run to the Archives.
They’ve been on my mind for awhile,
anyway.”

“Things aren’t the same as the last
time, you know. I hear there’s a new
Archivist.”
“Well, I’d better meet him, then.”
“Hmm,” said Shaa.
“Indeed.
Well,
you know where the Archives are. It
should be easy enough to discover the
hours of operation.”
“Right,” said Max. Why did he sound
so sarcastic? Jurtan thought. Oh, of
course. He’s Max; that means he proba-
bly plans to break into the place.
“And then there’s the Inauguration
Ball,” Shaa was continuing.
“As long
as I’m here in town I wouldn’t miss it
for the world.” In contrast to his words,
Shaa sounded kind of disgusted about
the whole thing, thought Jurtan. But
then you couldn’t necessarily tell about
Shaa. “Sitting around just waiting for
another shoe to drop does get a bit old.
Do you want to be there?”

“I rather think so,” Max said. “Don’t
you think it might be a good idea?”
“Goodness and wisdom have nothing
to do with it,” stated Shaa. “The fact
that it’s the beginning of the Season is
the only fact that really matters. And
what are we here for, after all, if not
the Season? The investiture of the ﬁrst
new emperor in over a decade is a vir-
tual footnote, a mere codicil.”
“What are you doing,” Max said, “try-
ing on your old persona? All that Peri-
dol stuff never worked for you. You’re
too odd.”
“Fortunately,” Shaa said, “you are
my friend. I shudder to think what you
might be saying about me otherwise.”
“Do you think your brother will be at
this Inauguration Ball?” asked Jurtan.
“Be there?” said Shaa.
“He practi-
cally owns the thing,”
“Oh,” Jurtan said. “Well, I guess you

have to run into him sometime.”
Shaa frowned. “Unfortunately, that
is rather the point.”

Chapter13
I
HAD
ARRIVED
AT
THE
AD-
DRESS SHAA HAD GIVEN ME just
in time to see Max and Jurtan Mont en-
tering, after Max had done something
crafty to the door. That meant link-up
with Shaa was out of the question for
the moment; the one person I was least
interested in dealing with right then
was Maximillian the Vaguely Disrep-
utable. Unless it was Zhardann or Jill,
or for that matter Gashanatantra, and

let’s not forget Joatal Ballista, AKA
Fradjikan, which I guess was just an-
other way of saying that I had more
trouble than I knew what to do with
any direction I turned.
Shaa was sure staying in a hoity-
toity section of town, I had to give him
that. Me, I was basically on the streets.
I’d had the vague idea of renting an of-
ﬁce and setting up shop, but the more
I thought about it the more potential
drawbacks kept surfacing, even aside
from the fact that with so many people
in town real estate was one of the com-
modities in shortest supply.
Staying
mobile might also help keep me ahead
of the folks on my tail. When you got
right down to it, too, the whole ofﬁce
idea was a distraction. I wasn’t here
to be a detective-for-hire, I was here to
ﬁnd answers and solutions to my own
problems.

Well, I’d lurked behind this tree
long enough. Night might have ﬁrmly
fallen, but here in the midst of Peridol
it didn’t seem to much matter.
The
streets had more lamps than anyplace
I’d seen before, and every other car-
riage or walker seemed to be carrying
another one of their own.
Lanterns
weren’t the half of it, either. Radiant
globs of magic and out-and-out sculp-
tures were perched in the intersections
and others were ﬂoating freely along
the boulevards. Over to the south, too,
in the part of town where I’d heard
the
sorcerers
congregated
in
their
rows of lofts, manufacturing plants,
academies,
and colleges,
occasional
sprays of ﬁreworks erupted into the
sky, and a large precessing pinwheel
had been hanging for the last half-hour
ﬁring aquamarine sparks.
As I pried myself loose from my

perch and strolled toward the end of
the block, splashes of light from near
and far washing over the scene, a man
turned the corner ahead of me, glanced
around him, and then launched him-
self into the nearest tree. Leaves rus-
tled gently but quickly fell still; the
guy was good. An indistinct form reap-
peared a moment later out on a branch.
The man swung himself onto the adja-
cent roof and into the glow of a dying
star-shell, and only then did I realize
I’d been watching Zalzyn Shaa.
He
was too far out of earshot to hail and
I’d never catch him going up the tree
either; he was moving at a surpris-
ingly good clip considering his health
problems.
I shrugged and headed on
toward the boulevard. I’d check back
with him later.
The question of the ofﬁce kept nag-
ging at me. A large part of my mind

was pulling me in the direction of famil-
iar instinct, as though it was following
some kind of built-in track and didn’t
want me to head off on my own.
It
probably wouldn’t make much differ-
ence one way or the other - if the gods
were going to come after me they’d ﬁnd
me sooner or later regardless, although
I might be able to make it later rather
than sooner, and on my terms. Maybe
what I really needed was some genuine
training in magic. I seemed stuck with
these abilities I’d sucked out of Gash,
and I kept running into these sorcery-
based situations to boot, so I might be
better off if I learned more about what
I really could be doing.
That wouldn’t be a bad idea to add
to my plan. Not that it was much of
a plan in the ﬁrst place, but you had
to start somewhere.
Distancing my-
self from Max felt like a reasonable

ﬁrst step. It would be even better if I
could take advantage of any informa-
tion Max might feed me through Shaa
while staying out of Max’s immediate
grasp, at least until I knew more about
what was going on.
There were other possibilities on my
list.
Learning how to more convinc-
ingly play the role of a god would be
nice. If I could do that, I might be able
to use or otherwise deal with the ring
containing the trapped Pod Dall. The
Karlinis had had the ring the last time
I checked, but if I needed to I could
probably get it away from them. Then
again, they might even let me borrow
it. I am - or I was - a detective; that
kind of thing should have been right
up my line.
That wasn’t the only thing up my
line. What about detecting, itself? My
own backtrail apparently didn’t exist

before I’d shown up in Roosing Oolvaya,
but that didn’t mean I might not still
uncover somebody who’d known me
earlier or some evidence about what I
might have been doing. A list of peo-
ple who’d been affected by the Spell of
Namelessness over the years would be
nice. Did any such list exist? If it did,
could it be short enough to be of any
use? Maybe there was documentation
about gods who’d had the Spell used
on them. That should be a shorter list
- how many gods would ever have been
in that situation, after all?
The Peridol library was supposed to
have all kinds of interesting stuff.
I
could do worse than stopping in to ask
the librarian.
But then, that wasn’t
the only individual it might be useful
to consult. The street wouldn’t be the
most likely place to ﬁnd him, however.
I put my head down and pushed for-

ward.
Like most other places I’d seen
in Peridol so far the boulevard was
crowded, even though it was going on
the middle of the evening.
The folks
in the crowd were better dressed and
altogether more kempt than those I’d
encountered earlier.
Given the high-
class appearance of the district, and its
location at the foot of the Crust not far
outside the gates, that wasn’t surpris-
ing. The street was free clear of scum
and garbage and the walls were clear
of the otherwise omnipresent posters
and slogans.
For all their show of gentility, though,
the passersby were acting a touch
strangely. Not in general, just toward
me.
Whenever I entered a patch of
decent lighting people started to stare.
More than one or two of them even
did a full-scale double-take on catching

sight of my face, and all around others
were nudging their companions and
pointing in my direction and stopping
to whisper among themselves. When I
glanced back I discovered a small gang
of kids dogging my steps.
I may have been from out-of-town
but I wasn’t exactly a bumpkin. There
was no straw in my hair, and I wasn’t
wearing hand-me-down homespun or
walking around in some costume of
equatorial minimalism. The last time
I checked no one was going to ﬁnd
on me an unusual number of arms or
eyes or some other major divergence in
physiognomy. Monoch wasn’t making
a nuisance of himself.
So what was
going on?
An alleyway appeared on the right
and I darted into it. A few twists later
I paused long enough to unwrap my
overcloak and slip it over my head. Un-

fortunately the cloak wasn’t designed
with head-covering in mind; if I ran
across a monk maybe I could try to
grab his hood.
Until then, I’d proba-
bly look like an itinerant ragpicker or
someone preparing for rain, but I could
live with that. I’d lived with worse.
I kept to the shadows and ﬁnally
ended up back in a decent-sized street,
in a less exalted but hopefully more
mind-your-own-business neighborhood.
As I stepped out of the alley I passed a
tall brick wall liberally plastered with
generation atop generation of messy
posters.
I had already gone past it
when some tickle in the back of my
mind made me stop, turn around, and
give the broadsides my real attention.
So that was it. Damn! It was a good
likeness too, or at least good enough.
There was Monoch ﬂaming away, and
the animated statue and the words of

ﬁre and the whole bit, but the greatest
care had gone into rendering me, pos-
ing me like a real honest-to-gods hero,
of all things. So much for being anony-
mous and melting into crowds; any of
my god pals who wanted to track me
down only had to listen for the mur-
murs and follow the stares. The next
time I saw Fradjikan I just might try
to wring his neck. No lie, he was turn-
ing out to be a pretty tricky customer
indeed.
On the other hand, being turned
into an icon of advertising probably did
solve another problem. From my cas-
ing the city on the way over to Shaa’s
place, and the map I’d picked up from
a street vendor, I knew pretty much
where I was; almost at my destination
of the moment. Ten minutes of brisk
walking
interspersed
with
slinking
from one shadow to the next brought

me to the nearest entrance.
The entrance itself was nothing dra-
matic.
It had instead the studied
nonchalance of someone who knows
they’re cool and wants to underline the
point by pretending they took it for
granted.
Characteristically, the obvi-
ous entrance that you came into off the
street was a well-stocked bar, with the
real entrance being a staircase leading
down from an unmarked alcove to the
left through the door to the kitchen. I
had to wait at the top for a party of
guys with swords to exit, and close on
their heels an axe-toting dwarf, before
I got my own chance to descend.
A sign of glowing words hung in
the air on the landing halfway down,
curling from one language and script-
form to the next in wisps of orange
and green while an unseen voice pro-
nounced their message directly into

your ear.
I heard a skirl of gibber-
ish, and then the voice said softly in
Peridol common, “Adventurer’s Club.
Members and qualiﬁed guests only.
Turn back now or risk consequences.”
I went through the message and down
the stairs to the lobby.
The lobby proved to be as small and
chummy as I’d imagined, with a lot
of dark panels of wood promoting the
shadowed gloom and a few burgundy-
cushioned armchairs trying to elbow it
back. One wall was hung with shred-
ded battle pennants stained with grass
and mud and other authentic-looking
substances. A trophy case faced it, the
most prominent of its exhibits being a
pair of thong sandals and a throwing
knife. I was bending over to read the
exhibit-card next to the shoes when a
throat cleared itself at me from behind
the reception desk.

“Good day, sir,” the clerk said as I am-
bled the three steps toward him across
the room. “I don’t believe you’ve been
with us before. May I help you? If you
wish to give an offering, the worship
area is upstairs.”
I rested an elbow on the counter. “I
need a room.”
The clerk’s tone remained noncom-
mittal.
“Are you certiﬁed, or do you
have tokens of accreditation?”
I pushed the cloak back off my head.
The clerk looked up from his register
and squinted, then one eyebrow went
up, followed by the other. “Ah,” he said,
“I see. I will put down ‘obvious current
notoriety.’ Accommodations for ... how
many in your party? Do you wish ﬂa-
grant or anonymous?”
“One, anonymous,” I told him.
“Do you plan to lecture or otherwise
hold forth?”

“I’ll let you know.”
“Very good, sir. Here is your key, the
map shows the hidden exits to your
suite, and here is your certiﬁcate of ac-
tive adventurer status. Just follow the
commotion to the bar of your choice.
Do you have baggage, or will you be
needing to restock or equip?”
This was all I’d heard, and more.
“Every Facility for the Discriminat-
ing Adventurer,” indeed. “Stocking up
would be nice,” I said.
“Shall I send the chandler or the ar-
morer around ﬁrst?”
“Whichever. It can wait till morning,
but what you could get me tonight is
some food.”
We went back and forth a few more
times on the question of the night
menu before he ﬁnally let me ﬁnd my
way to the room.
The halls snaked
along in short straight-line segments

broken by acute-angle jogs and lateral
offsets, the result being you could hear
if someone was approaching along the
hardwood ﬂoors before they hove into
sight. With the number of dark alcoves,
tall potted plants and ceiling-height
trees, and not a few coats of armor,
there were plenty of places to hide if
you didn’t want whoever-it-was to see
you. My suite proved to have a sitting
room, its own bathroom with function-
ing internal plumbing, and a bed ﬁt for
quite a few adventures itself, I didn’t
doubt. I dropped the pack and slipped
off my boots and settled back on top of
the covers to study the brochure.
Of
most immediate interest was the list of
hidden passages and doors, but I’d kick
myself forever if I’d been in a place like
this and didn’t ﬁnd out about the other
amenities.
I’d been examining the documenta-

tion and kicking a few other odd things
around in my mind for a moment or
two when a voice spoke in front of me.
“You have been causing a lot of people
a lot of trouble,” it said.
Standing there at the side of the bed
was someone I’d seen before. He’d been
at the gathering of gods I’d attended
courtesy of Zhardann and Jill and
Gash (in his disguise as Soaf Pasook).
Or at least someone who looked exactly
like the ﬁgure facing me now had been
at that meeting, which wasn’t at all the
same thing as being able to conclude
they were in fact the same personage,
as I had now come to understand more
deeply.
Nevertheless, the mustache,
the impossibly wavy blonde hair, the
neat scar, and the single jeweled ear-
ring that confronted me at the moment
in the ﬂickering lamplight were exactly
as I remembered them.

How they had snuck up on me was
another question.
For all I knew I’d
had another blackout. Seeing as who
this was, though, I wouldn’t have put
it past him in the least to have cat-
footed it into the room with me fully
conscious, and looking in his direction
all the time to boot.
“Phlinn Arol,” I
said. “Nice of you to drop by.” But then,
where better to encounter the Adven-
turers’ God but at the Adventurer’s
Club?
“I thought I’d bring your dinner
round myself,” said Phlinn.
He indi-
cated the tray next to me on the end
table. “The personal touch, you know.
Now that I’m here I ﬁnd I don’t seem to
have eaten lately, either. Do you mind
if I join you?”
“Be my guest,” I told him.
“If the
master of the house wants to spend his
time hanging out with a customer, it’s

a dumb customer indeed who’ll tell him
to get lost.”
Phlinn seated himself at the chair
next to the end table and set to work
carving hearty slices off the roast.
“You’re not a vegetarian, then, I take
it?”
He had popped in to see me, which
I suppose gave him the right to choose
the elements of conversation.
Still,
this was one of the stranger opening
gambits I could easily recall, and re-
member I’d been spending time with
some world masters of the disputa-
tionally bizarre.
“Not the last time I
checked,” I said. “If you’re looking for
vices I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.
I don’t smoke, but I have been known
to drink on occasion.” From the look of
the ﬂagon on the tray it was a reason-
able hope this occasion would be one of
them.

Phlinn Arol took a sidelong glance at
me, then returned his attention to the
roast. “I see,” he said. “I rather like di-
versity in adventurers, you know. Not
to mention the adventures themselves,
mind you; that goes without saying.
Horseradish sauce?”
“A small dollop on the side.”
“It’s excellent stuff. They grow the
roots out back.
Considering how far
the Club meanders, though, you won’t
ﬁnd that information very useful if you
think you can raid the garden, I’ll warn
you right now.”
I had a feeling there was some local
allusion going on here I wasn’t tuned
into. The Treasure of the Secret Herb
Garden of the Adventurers’ Club? But
then the world was a strange place.
I settled for saying, “I’m not in town
looking for treasures,” and let him take
that whichever way he wanted.

“No,” said Phlinn Arol, “no, I didn’t
suppose you were. Treasures of the ma-
terial sort at any rate, hmm?”
“Why can’t anybody ever have a
straightforward
starts-here
ends-up-
there kind of talk?” I muttered. “This
stuff gets a little old.”
“Complained like a true adventurer,”
Phlinn commented approvingly. “I pre-
sume you will unbend your feelings
about vegetables sufﬁciently to accept
some of these peas on the side, and
perhaps a spear of broccoli? The local
chef makes a specialty out of scalloping
these potatoes, too, I’d best warn you.”
“Everything but the broccoli,” I said.
“I hate broccoli.”
“Do you now,” he said, almost to him-
self. “I wouldn’t have thought broccoli
would be invariant, of all things.”
“Wait a minute,” I said, taking the
plate from his hand and setting it

right down again. “What are you talk-
ing about? What’s the big deal about
broccoli?”
Phlinn eyed me consideringly.
“I
once knew someone who hated broc-
coli. He wasn’t anything else like you,
though.”
Hated broccoli?
What kind of use-
less coincidence was that?
On the
other hand, maybe this broccoli-hater
had been my father. Maybe my brother.
Hell, maybe he’d been me.
“Broccoli,
eh? Sounds interesting. How long ago
did you know this friend?”
“Forget about it,” Phlinn said, wav-
ing his hand dismissively. “I’m sure it’s
not relevant.”
“Relevant? To what?”
“To our conversation, of course.”
“To what conversation?
You waltz
in here, say I’ve been causing a lot
of trouble, and then the only think

you talk about is vegetables.
Look, I
was coming here to see you because I
was hoping to get some answers, and
I wouldn’t mind maybe a little help
either. I’ve been paying dues to you all
these years, I ﬁgure I should be able
to ask for something. And then there
were those cryptic little comments you
dropped the last time we met, when we
were all ganging up on old Sapriel.”
“Cryptic comments?”
“Yeah, that’s right, about how we
should get together, about how our in-
terests are congruent, I think you said,
about how you’d been in contact with a
friend of mine named Max.”
“Oh,” he said, in a pro forma sort of
way, “those cryptic comments. If you re-
call, there were others around at the
time. Speaking plainly was plainly un-
wise.”
“Yeah,” I said, “right.
But there

aren’t others around now.” The state-
ments I’d reminded him of weren’t all,
either.
There had been his remarks
about his association with the long-
dead god who had started Abdication-
ism, a guy called Byron, remarks that
had implied that Phlinn Arol might
now be the main keeper of the ﬂame.
And Gash had told me to stay away
from Phlinn because he was a subver-
sive radical, too.
All of which had bounced Phlinn
Arol to the number-one slot on my list
of folks I should be talking to.
Except now I was talking to him, and
it was about as rewarding as interro-
gating the broccoli he’d included, after
all, on my plate.
“You are a lot of trouble,” Phlinn Arol
told me.
“Why, because when I ask somebody
a question and they don’t want to an-

swer, I ask it again? You must hang
out in a pretty quiet section of town.”
He set down his fork and raised his
arm. It occurred to me then that for
all his cozy exterior, he was a god, and
probably one of the more powerful I’d
run across. Phlinn gestured at me, but
it was Monoch, resting on the bed at
my far side, who stirred. Monoch made
a low whine and rolled over against my
leg. He was hot and vibrating.
“That is a particularly dangerous im-
plement to be carrying around,” Phlinn
Arol informed me. “Especially if one is
not its owner.”
“Who says I’m not its owner? Gashana
gave it to me.”
“If you believe that you’re not the
person I take you for.
“Okay,” I said, “then you tell me.
Who do you take me for?”
Phlinn hesitated, then lowered his

hand.
Monoch continued to make
the buzz of an aggravated beehive.
I wanted to take Monoch in my own
hand, but what was I going to do then?
Attack the broccoli? I wanted informa-
tion out of Phlinn Arol, not a battle
royal. Finally he spoke. “You are not
who you seem to be, you know.”
“That’s not exactly news.”
“You are also not who you think you
are.”
“Seeing as I don’t even have the
slightest idea who I think I am any
more, that also isn’t hard. If you know
so much, who am I, then?”
“That’s a very good question.”
“Yeah,” I said, “more news. Maybe
I’d better phrase it a different way.
Who do you think I am?”
“Perhaps no one,” said Phlinn Arol.
“On the other hand, perhaps someone.
I’m not being evasive, I really don’t

know.”
I gave him a dirty look.
“Let’s
start with the basics, then.
I’m not
Gashanatantra, you know that.
You
knew that the other time we met. You
knew I wasn’t Gash even though no-
body else except Gash seemed to. Gash
had a good excuse; he was the one
who’d set me up, and he was there
in his own disguise as Soaf Pasook.
So how did you know?
And how did
you know I had some connection with
Max, and why was that something we
needed to talk about?”
“Simple enough,” Phlinn said, tak-
ing another bite of roast. He swallowed
and thumped himself on the chest. “I
love that horseradish. There’s a story
behind that horseradish, in fact -” He
eyed me, and must have caught the
ﬂavor of my expression and its clear
message of rapidly dwindling patience.

“But perhaps that story should wait for
later.
Max mentioned you to me, so
I know about the Spell of Nameless-
ness, of course. Max thought I might
know who you were. When I saw you,
it was easy enough to determine who
you were supposed to be, what with the
aural interleave from Gashanatantra
and the camouﬂage ﬁeld being put out
by your friend, there.” He nodded at
Monoch.
“Is Monoch transmitting to Gash?”
“Not at the moment,” he said with
certainty.
“But in general it’s quite
likely. I’d be surprised if Gashanatantra
wasn’t rather interested in the ques-
tion of your identity himself. I assume
he stumbled across you by accident
and only later discovered what he’d
stirred up.
You’ve been making sig-
niﬁcant use of his magical resources,
haven’t you?”

“Not in a real controlled way,” I said,
“but yeah, I have.
I haven’t exactly
been efﬁcient at it, though.
It might
help if I had a better idea what I’m
doing.”
“We can look into that. From what
one hears,
you’ve been particularly
lucky, you know.”
“That hasn’t escaped my notice ei-
ther, and don’t bother to tell me luck
doesn’t last forever because I know
that too.
Magic isn’t the only area
where I don’t know the score. As long
as all these other gods think I’m a god
just like them and I’ve got to keep up
the fancy footwork - well, you know
what kind of loser’s game that is.” If I
couldn’t get dancing lessons, at least I
might get a look at the dance card.
“Oh, you’ve got the attitude down
just right, don’t worry about that.”
I didn’t know whether that was

supposed to be a compliment or not.
Since I wasn’t after praise or approval,
though, I’d take the information con-
tent of his remark at face value and
ignore the tone. “Are you waiting for
me to tell you how much I already
know so you won’t have to reveal too
much new to me?
Fine, if that’s the
way you’re going to make it.” Under
normal circumstances I would have
held out and played with him awhile
longer; the less you seemed to want the
more you could usually end up with. I
had the feeling his patience would out-
last mine, though. He was interested
in me but he was also just ﬁshing;
if he had a particular goal in mind I
couldn’t sense what it was.
I took a
deep breath.
“I know about the Con-
servationists and the Abdicationists;
the Conservationists wanting to keep
the status quo and the Abdicationists

ﬁghting to make the gods phase out of
meddling with the world. That’s over-
simpliﬁed, but okay. I know about Pod
Dall holding a balance of power that
kept too much from happening. Then
he wound up trapped in a ring and the
balance started to break down. Gash
helped put him in the ring, and now
Gash is doing his best to ride with his
plot and stay a winner while cleaning
up against his enemies while he’s at it.
Using me as his broom.”
“You have a particularly vibrant way
of putting things, do you know that?
But let that pass. You’ve been out of
touch since Oolsmouth, haven’t you?”
“Yeah, I suppose you could say that.”
“Then you don’t know what your
pal Zhardann kicked loose by his little
stunt, do you.”
“I can guess,” I said.
“Can you?” said Phlinn Arol. “After

Zhardann convened that gathering to
put the seal of mass approval on his
move against Sapriel it’s been a ver-
itable madhouse out there.
It’s gone
far beyond politics. Every grudge and
petty vendetta anyone’s ever harbored
is out in the open.
How long has it
been in real time, a few weeks?
At
least three gods have been decorpore-
alized, three, and there are rumors of
another two more.
Decorporealized.
That’s more than in most decades. Yes,
they were minors, but still.
It’s an
absolute mess.”
“And you’re just sitting on the side-
lines? Trying to quiet things down?”
“What do you take me for? If I don’t
uphold my image I’m a target.”
“I see,” I told him. And maybe I did,
or at least maybe I was starting to. The
situation might have gone far beyond
politics, but I bet it wasn’t ignoring

them either. The issue of Abdication-
ism was a question of existence to the
gods, and under what (and whose)
terms.
“Are you telling me it’s open
warfare among the gods? Every god for
himself?”
“It’s not quite that bad,” Phlinn ac-
knowledged, mopping his brow with
his napkin and trying to calm himself
down, “not yet, anyway. The only way
we’ve been able to live together all
these years in some degree of harmony
has been though our traditions, our
customs and protocols and rituals, our
ways of adjudicating disputes and bat-
tles and so forth without spilling into
general warfare.”
“I don’t understand something. How
did Zhardann’s little ploy upset all
of that, then?
By stacking the deck
against Sapriel?
Was that what was
against the rules?”

“No,” he said. “Yes. Zhardann was
the trigger. The fuse was there, he pro-
vided the match.”
The fuse, I thought. But that’s not
all I thought. “Pod Dall,” I said. “But I
thought he was a Death.”
“Death is such a relative term,”
Phlinn Arol said, a little impatiently,
I thought.
Phlinn took another look
at the roast and then pushed his plate
away from him, scowling at it. “All of
us can be Deaths, if you think about
things in that sort of way. The Death
part was the least important side to
Pod Dall.
He was one of the Checks
and Balances. He was the Referee. A
strange fellow, Pod Dall.” Phlinn shook
his head. “To be willing to stand out-
side, to backpedal his own aggrandize-
ment, to neglect scheming and plotting,
to be evenhanded - well, it’s certainly
not godlike, I can assure you of that.”

I’d seen enough on my own to agree
with him.
“So no one else wants to
do his job and the system’s breaking
down.”
Phlinn glanced up at me, squinted,
and looked away across the room.
“I
wish Byron was still around. He’s the
only one who could have made heads
or tails of this and brought things back
under control. Any of the rest of us who
try will most likely just add to the con-
fusion.”
Like I said I’d heard about Byron be-
fore; Byron, Phlinn Arol’s old pal; By-
ron, founder of Abdicationism; Byron,
creator of the gods’ communication and
meeting system, and, by inference, the
larger infrastructure Phlinn had just
been alluding to; Byron, described by
Phlinn as “the trickiest of us all, but
not always the most prudent;” Byron,
purged by the gods - by Jardin himself,

in fact - and dead-and-gone these sev-
eral centuries. Byron, who Phlinn had
associated with what he’d called “the
genesis thing.” “If Byron was so smart,
why didn’t he deal with a contingency
like this? Wouldn’t he ﬁgure something
might happen to your Referee?”
“At the end he might not have cared,”
Phlinn said slowly.
It looked like I’d
started a thought in his mind, though.
“Byron knew the innards of what
made you gods tick, right?” I continued.
“Why would he bother with Abdication-
ism in the ﬁrst place? Why not shut
the system down himself? Why bother
spinning things out this way?”
“He liked the system, thought it
could be reformed.” But Phlinn sounded
a bit uncertain of himself.
“And
what
happened
to
Byron’s
stuff?
His records, his papers, any
equipment? Who else was he friendly

with? Maybe he did leave something
helpful around.
Where would it be?
Who would have it?”
Phlinn said something, but I couldn’t
hear it. I knew it wasn’t important, re-
ally, it was only something vague about
looking through his own records, and
maybe there were a few other places
for him to check too.
I couldn’t hear
him directly, but I caught the sense
of what he was saying.
I hadn’t re-
alized I was concentrating so much
on my own questions, focusing my-
self so much that I was digging into
Gash’s data link again, but obviously
I was because all of a sudden my vi-
sion blurred, the sounds of the room
faded out, the world of mist I’d seen in
my dream descended, and I could see
another realer-then-real face, and had
on the tip of my tongue another name.
I couldn’t quite get at the name yet,

but I knew whose name it was; Byron’s
last protégé close to the end. A wizard
of some sort, a human wizard.
Phlinn was looking at me strangely
- he was on his feet, too. I blinked. At
the moment I’d noticed Phlinn again, it
was because the mist had suddenly dis-
appeared. “Why was I saying all that
to you?” Phlinn muttered. “I wasn’t - I
didn’t - I, ah.” He had his hand pointed
in my direction again, his head tilted
quizzically to one side. “There may be
more that makes you a detective than
just your training, I think,” he said to
himself, still mumbling.
There was too much going on here,
far too much.
I needed to catch my
thoughts. I still needed to ask about
- “The Spell of Namelessness,”’ I said.
“Maybe there’s some compensating ef-
fect; you lose your memory, you become
a detective. Tell me this - who knows

the most about the Spell? How many
people have been hit by it - is there a
list? Is there -”
The stand-up closet against the wall
behind Phlinn had pivoted open, re-
vealing a dark opening that hadn’t
been listed in the brochure I’d been
reading about the room, and Phlinn
was backing toward it. “Far too many
for a list,” Phlinn said, “far too many.
Perhaps Jardin has records, you know
he likes that spell of course, don’t you?,
but still there would be far too many.
Jardin’s not the only one wielding that
spell, you know, although he does have
it by right of ofﬁce.
But you know
that too already, don’t you. I’m afraid
there’s no help for you there.”
“Wait a minute! I still have a lot to -”
“I’ve spent far too long - I have other
business, pressing business.
I’ll be
back in contact. I’m on your side, you

know.”
“It’s good to know that,” I told him.
“That’s reassuring, but -”
Apparently
satisﬁed,
he
contin-
ued
through
the
bureau
and
van-
ished through the wall. The furniture
wheeled shut behind him.
Slowly, I
shut my mouth, bottling up the ques-
tions I’d never gotten to ask, not to
mention the ones he’d never answered.
Some detective I was.
He’d left me with the remains of the
roast. He’d also left the broccoli. The
broccoli wasn’t the largest problem
he’d left behind, though.
I don’t know why I hadn’t expected
it. After all, everybody else seemed to
be lying to each other, or at best pass-
ing around half-truths.
Why should
Phlinn Arol be any different?
That
he knew more than he was willing to
admit seemed certain, or at least if

he didn’t know for sure he had some
strong suspicions.
What was he afraid I’d ﬁnd out?
Even more, why had he seemed to fall
apart there at the end? He was Phlinn
Arol, for gods’ sake. Why was he afraid
of me?
The link to Gash had shut down
again, now that I had a real question
for it. I mean, how much use would it
be for me to know that good old Byron,
gone for centuries, had palled around
with a human? A mere human would
have been dead a long time too by now.
Well, maybe someone else had heard
of him. Or maybe I’d ﬁnd something
about him in my research, this wizard
called ...
called?
Iskendarian, that’s
what his name was. Big deal. In Peri-
dol you could buy a dozen wizards with
a good-sized carp.

Chapter14
AS HAD BEEN HIS HABIT SINCE
HIS YOUTH, Svin closed his eyes,
turned his face to the heavens, threw
wide his arms, and began to draw a
deep, forceful breath in through his
nose. He had managed no more than a
moderate sniff before the air launched
a full-scale assault on his nostrils and
lungs - there was smoke in it, and
soot, and rancid cooking grease, and
some type of acrid brew that made his

chest seize in its expansion as though
slapped suddenly around by bands of
iron, and - but it was too disgusting to
even contemplate. Svin exhaled with
a convulsive wheeze-and-gasp that far
outstripped the effort he’d put into
bringing the vile stuff into his body in
the ﬁrst place.
He was far from the pure frozen nec-
tar of his youth in the north, as if he
needed yet another reminder of how
much his path had taken him away
from ...
from what?
Harmony and
oneness with nature? Well, yes, that
had been part of it, and the way of
the warrior born, too, and the other
traditions of his fathers. But then new
experiences were not necessarily a bad
thing either, nor (as he was gradually
coming to acknowledge) was personal
change or growth. Now if only -
“Isn’t this great, Svin - I mean just

look at it!”
Svin opened his eyes.
Tildamire
Mont, freshly scrubbed and with her
hair still damp from the morning Kar-
lini wash-ritual, had joined him on the
stoop in front of the facility. Svin had
heard her approach, of course, and had
identiﬁed her by the sound of her step.
Of course he had, he told himself. After
all, that was no more than his job. But
- “Great?” he said.
“Sure it is!” Tildy bubbled. “Here we
are at last in a real city - I mean it
moves, it bustles, things are happening
everywhere, and it’s all going on all day
and all night - it is great!”
“Great,” repeated Svin, with less en-
thusiasm and no little skepticism. It
did move, it did bustle, and so forth;
these things were undeniable.
The
narrow street in front of the small
building the Karlini party had taken

over hadn’t been empty for a moment
since they’d arrived, night or day.
If
anything, there were more carts, peo-
ple,
animals,
familiars,
and things
rattling along its twisty maze the later
the hour became, reaching a climax
only toward midnight.
That too was
to be expected. Where else would the
Karlinis set up shop but in the heart of
the Conjurers’ Quarter?
Fortunately Svin had gotten a lot
of rest on the boat.
After they’d ﬁn-
ished hauling all the gear from the
ship through the tangled streets and
their congested trafﬁc, Roni would set-
tle for nothing but that they immediate
unpack and set things up. This oper-
ation had taken them all the better
part of the day and well into the night.
Svin’s short sleep had started then,
only to terminate some unknown dis-
tance into the new day when several

crowds of shouting students from some
of the nearby schools or academies had
lurched along, shouting spells and im-
precations at each other.
They had
stopped to launch into a mass duel
right underneath Svin’s second-story
open-window guard-perch. Pinwheels
and sprays of multicolored ﬁrebeams
were lancing outside the window when
he’d cranked open his eyes, dying em-
bers raining their sooty fallout in the
low breeze directly through the case-
ment and onto his chest.
There was nothing to be done about
it,
though;
nothing practical,
any-
way.
The neighbors on either side
and across the street were obviously
old hands at this sort of entertainment.
After making sure their buildings were
not actually burning, they leaned out
their own windows and proceeded to
yell at each other or the academicians

below in running commentary, place
the occasional side bet,
dodge the
nastier-looking constructs from below,
and rain a few tricks down in return.
Svin had watched silently, his sword
at the ready, but the Great Karlini
had gone further, rousing himself to
spin out a swarm of animated pink
mosquito-things that had gone swoop-
ing down into the crowd. Judging from
the reaction below, the pink things
had acted like real mosquitoes, setting
loose a wave of frenzied swatting bro-
ken by ouches and squeals of pain. For
this, Karlini’s wife had taken the time
to chide him, reminding him that they
were not here to attract attention but
to do work. Karlini had turned away,
his frown once again intact.
But how much attention would one
more magic-user bring around here?
The
only
normal
people
Svin
had

found within the three-block radius
he’d scoured when he’d been out scout-
ing the terrain had been the propri-
etors of the carpet factory down the
block, another warehouse of dry-goods,
and the row of food stands lining the
larger avenue their street opened into,
although some of the foodstuffs they’d
had available for sale had made Svin
avert his eyes and stride quickly past.
Everyone else seemed to be involved
in sorcery, one way or another. Either
they were doing it, or manufacturing
it, or advertising it, or soliciting it, or
(as the Karlini’s were) studying and re-
searching it. Or they were themselves
magic, in one way or another.
One thing few of them seemed to
like was being up in the early morn-
ing.
This wasn’t a surprise either, of
course; it was virtually a standard of
magical practice. Prior to his attempt

at breathing, Svin had been watching
as several knots of weaving folks stum-
bled home from their taverns or study
sessions, jostling against the trades-
people coming in to restock, provision,
or clean house.
“It’s not just the city itself,” Tildamire
added. “It’s got real people and every-
thing.”
That was clearly more to the heart
of the matter than her earlier, more
sweeping remarks.
Svin didn’t think
she was referring to people in general
now, either. She was now surely talk-
ing about something Svin did know
about. “You mean real men,” said Svin.
Tildy gave a start, began to glance at
him, then collected herself and turned
deliberately away. “Well, so what if I
do?
What’s wrong with a little fun?
This is a real town, and I want to go
out on it.”

“So you shall,” Svin rumbled.
“What do you mean by that? You’re
not planning to take me. Are you?”
If that was how she was going to be,
so be it. “That is part of my job,” he told
her. “I am to be your escort.”
Tildy frowned. “My guard, you mean.
They want you to make sure I don’t
have any real fun.”
It was more the other way around, as
far as Svin saw it. “Say what you like.
My people are not dour all the time. We
also live for fun.”
“Huh?” she said, with a look of thor-
ough disbelief. Whatever her full-scale
retort would have been, though, was
never to be known, for amidst the clat-
ter of wheels on the cobblestones, the
beating of an area rug out the upper-
story window of the potion factory
across the street, and the general hub-
bub of morning commerce, was heard

suddenly a familiar voice. The voice of
Zalzyn Shaa, in fact.
“I told you, Maximillian,” Shaa was
saying.
“The Wraith District near
Sheepsend, that was where we would
ﬁnd them. Did you listen to me? No, of
course not. You never listen to me, you
never listen to anyone.
Hodgetown,
you said, so Hodgetown it had to be,
halfway across the city.”
But where was Shaa? There, behind
the milk wagon rattling past behind
its shufﬂing dray horse.
For all his
downbeat words, Tildy thought Shaa
cut a natty ﬁgure in his yellow slacks
and a rakishly tailored jacket with
bold red and blue stripes. Next to him
was her brother Jurtan. It was Jurtan,
wasn’t it?
But who else could it be?
Surely it was her imagination, but Ju-
rtan looked a good inch or two taller
than he’d stod when they’d parted in

Roosing Oolvaya, and more wiry, too;
in fact his whole upper body had ﬁlled
out, and his face had traded the pasty
white of candlelit rooms for the darker
glow of the outdoors. It was strange -
for an instant Tildy had looked at Ju-
rtan and seen their father, the former
Lion of the Oolvaan Plain, which had
certainly never happened before.
As
far as had ever been evident, Jurtan
might as well have been a foundling
adopted in infancy.
Certainly no one
would have mistaken him for a blood
relative to the Lion.
Now, though -
but she’d never tell that to Jurtan, of
course.
That was two of them.
But where
was Max?
Shaa had been talking to
him, but where was he?
There was
a
shabby,
road-beaten,
comprehen-
sively disreputable ﬁgure slouching
along beside Jurtan, its whiskery face

virtually invisible beneath a droop-
ing wide-brimmed hat, but ... wait a
minute - Max was called the Vaguely
Disreputable, wasn’t he?
Jurtan was muttering, “We could
have saved ourselves that whole de-
tour and stayed in bed past the crack
of dawn for once. At least no one tried
to kill us on the way over, although
there was that greasy stuff you bought
us from that food vendor.”
“I thought you wanted to be scenic,”
said Max’s voice from beneath the
slouch hat.
Either he was throwing his voice, or
... it was him, though. “I thought you
were only supposed to be vaguely dis-
reputable,” Tildy told Max as the trio
drew to a halt in front of the building.
“But there’s nothing vague about you -
you’re a total mess.”
“And this is after he even had a bath

at Shaa’s,” added Jurtan.
“Birds of a feather, the lot of them,”
Max said to Shaa. “I wash my hands of
them all, and high time too. They’re all
yours. You take care of them now.”
“And your promise to the Lion?”
Shaa drawled.
“If he shows up he’d be on my side.”
“Max?” said Svin, eyeing the unrec-
ognizable character in front of him.
“You are the Maximillian who -”
“Yeah, hey Svin,” Max said, punch-
ing him on the arm. “I’m glad Groot
found you.
How’s it been - more in-
teresting than guarding a caravan,
right?”
“It has been educational,” Svin ad-
mitted.
“Is Roni here?” asked Max.
They went inside.
Behind a short
entry hall was a large open room with
a two-story warehouse ceiling. A long

straight staircase headed up to the
right along the wall.
Beneath the
staircase, a row of person-tall wooden
vats caulked with tar marched toward
the rear.
An elevated catwalk hung
over the vats, and above that a trav-
eling block-and-tackle suspended from
a track on the ceiling. An assortment
of tables, bookcases, and blackboards
were scattered around the well-lit area
in the back. Ronibet Karlini was stand-
ing in front of one of the blackboards,
her hands thrust in the pockets of a
white smock and her face furrowed
in concentrated thought, watching a
piece of chalk scratch a new series of
equations in the midst of the maze of
symbols already festooning the board.
“That classiﬁcation has to be wrong,”
the voice of the Great Karlini was say-
ing from the depths of a high-backed
armchair also facing the blackboard.

“Why’s that?” said Roni.
“Read your own observations.” The
top of one of Roni’s laboratory logbooks
waved beyond the chair’s armrest, the
edge of a ﬁnger visible at its base.
“You’ve looked at enough of these free-
living animalcules to have plenty of
comparisons. I really think you should
concentrate on the paramecium model
rather than the -”
“What do I have to do to get noticed
around here,” said Max, “break a chair
over somebody’s head?”
“Yes, here he is, ladies and gen-
tlemen, courteous as ever,” muttered
Shaa.
Max continued to ignore him, which
(as Shaa had already pointed out) was
typical.
Shaa (also quite routinely)
continued to offer side comments and
the occasional suggestion of dubious
though intriguing merit, but somehow

they still made it quickly through the
basic catching-up and recounting of
stories. Haddo and Wroclaw circulated
with coffee and morning refreshments,
having already made a run to the bak-
ery on the corner.
The Iskendarian
manuscripts were again produced and
perused, still without signiﬁcant use-
ful results.
“There is something familiar about
these, though,” Roni said, pointing to
one block of equations on the third
Iskendarian sheet. Actually, she was
pointing at the mirror they’d set up
for increased ease in viewing; one of
Iskendarian’s tricks had been writing
in reverse,
with certain characters
shaved off or twisted additionally to
make it less obvious what was going
on.
Which is to say the characters
themselves were recognizable, when
put back through the right transforma-

tions. The language and the meaning
of the text were not.
Still, equations are still equations.
“But those are not equations,”’ Shaa
said,
peering
over
Roni’s
shoulder.
“They appear to represent a descen-
dance hierarchy, this begat that or
some such,
or perhaps a synthetic
pathway.”
“These aren’t spellwork,” added Kar-
lini.
“Unless Iskendarian was using
his own really strange notation.
I
mean, obviously he was using his own
strange notation, we can see that, but
you understand what I mean.”
Roni
was
rummaging
through
a
stack of her own papers ﬁled neatly
on a shelf near the worktable. “Look at
this,” she said, selecting a loose page.
“Here.” She smoothed the sheet down
next to the Iskendarian.
“Similar,” commented Shaa. “Not ex-

act, but clearly similar.”
“My page shows what I think are
the relationships between some of the
different animalcules I’ve been study-
ing,” explained Roni. “You can see the
drawings I made of what these micro-
organisms look like under the micro-
scope. As you know, we’ve discovered
that some of these animalcules exhibit
rudimentary magical behavior. That is,
with the right ﬁlters they can be seen
giving off disorganized spell-packets;
they look like little bright ﬂashes un-
der magniﬁcation.
These organisms
aren’t actually spell-casting, of course,
and they don’t seem to be using this
release of magical energy for any par-
ticular purpose. Nevertheless, they are
somehow generating magic.”
She
stood
back
and
frowned
in
concentration.
“Not all animalcules
show this characteristic, though. Even

species that look to be closely related
may be dramatically different in the
amount of magic they’re giving off. I
thought by classifying them I could
determine what other features might
set the Thaumaturgia apart and -”
“Thaumaturgia?” said Shaa.
“One-celled magic-using organisms.”
“Of course,” Shaa said under his
breath. “How silly of me.”
“And then when you’ve studied them
you’re going to breed them, right?” said
Tildamire.
“Of course,” said Karlini.
But he
didn’t sound too happy about it. “Why
do you think we’ve got all those vats?
We’ll cultivate them as a power source.
Breed them so they can do real magic,
then teach them some spells and set a
ﬂask of them loose as weapons. Breed
them so people can drink them down
and -”

“You sound like you’ve got some prob-
lem,” said Max.
With the slouch hat
and the scraggly beard both off and
resting on the table next to him he was
now recognizably himself, which only
made the warning tone in his voice and
the glint of caution in his eye all the
more apparent. “All the study and poli-
ticking and fancy footwork won’t mean
a thing if we can’t meet the gods head-
to-head and overpower them.
You
know all about that.
So what’s your
problem?”
“I barely know from day to day what
my name is, let alone where your re-
search is going,” Karlini said, looking
from Max to Roni. “I want to keep up
on things, that’s all.” He shrugged. “I
just want to be able to tell when it’s
time to head for the next county.”
“Oh, yeah?” said Max. “Why would
you want to do that? When’s that going

to be?”
“When you let these things you’re
breeding out. You know, of course, once
you let them out you’re never going to
get them back in. I’ve been watching
them. They’ll keep breeding by them-
selves, mutating, gaining their own
powers and -”
“They’re so small you can’t even see
them,” Max protested. “They’re going
to be under our control, they’ll -”
“You can see them when there’s a lot
of them piled up together,” Karlini told
him. “Look over there in that basin be-
hind you.”
“You’re missing the point entirely,”
said Roni.
“Dear.
In planning our
own Arcanocytes - engineered magic-
using organisms -” she inserted, seeing
Shaa’s uplifted eyebrow, “- there’s al-
ways been the question whether this is
original work or not.”

“Original work?” said Karlini.
“Of
course it’s original - we’ve been all
through the journals and Encyclopedia
Necromantica and -”
“And now the unpublished papers of
Iskendarian too,” ﬁnished Roni. “Don’t
you think these change the story? Look
here, and here, and here. Iskendarian
studied the same things, I’d bet on it.
And unless I miss my guess he ﬁgured
out to do the same stuff we’re working
on.”
“You wouldn’t expect to ﬁnd all this
spread out in the literature if it’s as
powerful as we think,” Max added.
“Anybody who developed anything that
heavy would keep it for themselves.”
“So maybe Iskendarian did the same
stuff a hundred years ago,” said Kar-
lini. “Where did it get him?”
A very good question, thought Shaa.
It was not the only one, either. Was Isk-

endarian even the ﬁrst?
According to the old documentary
sources Max unearthed from time to
time,
and other material they had
viewed
over
the
years,
there
had
clearly been a time when magic did not
exist. If that was true, and Shaa saw
no reason to doubt it, it was equally
clear that something had changed.
Introduction of magic to a world
that had none would have been a cat-
aclysmic event. An event that ﬁt that
description had in fact taken place in
historical times.
While the circum-
stances were obscure and a subject of
scholarly debate, it seemed quite likely
that the Dislocation and the appear-
ance of magic in the world had been
one and the same.
Fine, that was the story in broad-
brush. But what lay behind the macro-
event?
What had changed to bring

magic to life? And had it changed by
itself, or had someone changed it?
These
one-celled
micro-organisms
were most likely involved, but they
could only be part of it.
The Karlini
bodies Roni was now describing were
another, more interesting step on the
road. She had discovered the Karlini
bodies within human cells - indeed in
her own cells, and those of her hus-
band.
They were analogous to the
free-living Thaumaturgia; quite sim-
ilar in many features but at least a
step beyond. In fact, the Karlini bod-
ies were apparently the organelles at
the root of the human ability to wield
magic. If one was of an anthropomor-
phic bent, one could speculate that
the Thaumaturgia were rough drafts;
experiments done to work out the ba-
sic concepts. The Karlini bodies were
what the Thaumaturgia had given

birth to.
Okay, discovering the cellular raw
materials at the source of magic was
a nice piece of work, but it presented
a much more central problem than
Roni’s Thaumaturgia did.
It seemed
unlikely that such a powerful and
complicated
system
could
have
ap-
peared by accident. To have happened
overnight - or at least quickly enough
to cause a revolutionary event such as
the Dislocation – by accident seemed
all but impossible.
One had to pre-
sume somewhere behind the scene a
designing hand.
So who had caused it?
And where were they now?
Max had followed Roni over to a
work area near the vats. A chalk circle
had been marked off on the ﬂoor sur-
rounding a fence with a locked gate;
within the fence were the interlaced

green and pink tracers that indicated
an active defense matrix. Within the
matrix ﬁeld was a membranous tent;
inside that, completely enclosed, was
the actual workspace.
Overhead, an
array of nozzles led up to a cylindri-
cal tank hung from the ceiling. As he
watched Roni lead Max into the central
tent-area, Shaa was morosely pleased
to note that the safeguards did appear,
in fact, to be adequate. The acid- and
ﬂame-bath system overhead should
be thoroughly adequate to scorch any-
thing unlikely enough to emerge under
its own power from the multi-level
quarantine.
Of course, the quarantine measures
were really designed to contain some-
thing migrating by random chance on
air currents or ﬂowing along the ﬂoor,
or the products of explosion or other ac-
cident; bulk processes, in other words.

But what if that assumption was inade-
quate? What if it something was trying
to escape because it was smart?
That wasn’t beyond the bounds of
reason either. After all, Roni had the
ring from Roosing Oolvaya inside the
sealed workspace; she’d said she was
using its emanations and ﬁelds for a
template and power source.
But the
ring wasn’t merely a generator. It had
a Death trapped inside it. The Death
hadn’t been acting too intelligently
when it had gotten out in Roosing
Oolvaya, and look at the damage it
had still caused. It - huh?
“What was that?” Shaa called out.
His chair had shaken. No, more than
that - he had heard a dull whoom!
sound. And it hadn’t been merely his
chair. The building had rattled.
“Well, it’s not us,” Roni yelled back,
emerging from the quarantine tent

to glance around the lab.
Glassware
was still clattering and liquid could be
heard sloshing in the sealed vats but
nothing had broken.
“Something like that’s happened at
least once a day since we’ve been here,”
Tildamire said to no one in particular.
“You got to get used to it living in a
neighborhood like this,” said Max from
Roni’s side.
“All these magic users
around, and students too, somebody’s
always blowing something -”
WHOOM! The ﬂoor lurched.
Ev-
eryone staggered.
A heavy bookcase
leaned out from the wall, then smashed
back. “The street,” said Shaa, leading
the way.
Before they reached the front door
the smell of smoke was unmistak-
able.
Clouds of black were billowing
from the carriage entry in the build-
ing across the street.
The building’s

double stable-sized doors were lying
in the street, fractured and shredded.
Through the opening the doors had left,
ﬂashes of green were illuminating the
smoke from within. The ﬂashes were
coming off an angular green lattice-
work, warped and jagged and growing
as it fed on itself.
That wasn’t the only glow in sight,
either: magenta was radiating from be-
neath Max’s slouch hat as well. “What
is that place?” he said. “There’s active
reaction products in there shedding
magic like crazy.
Something’s going
toxic, can you feel it?”
“It’s a potion factory,” said Karlini.
“Looks like they’ve been operating on
a shoestring; not enough safeguards.
Typical.”
“I thought you scouted the neighbor-
hood before you set up here?”
“We did,” said Roni. “There’s at least

one of these shops on every block every-
where in the district.”
Something in the factory was going
clunk - WHINE, clunk - WHINE. With
each whine, static crackled, hair stood
on end, and clothes leapt out from
the body.
“Feel that?” Shaa inserted.
“There is still an active containment
ﬁeld.”
The inner recesses of the smoke
column were consolidating, too; crys-
tallizing, in fact.
A few humanoid
shapes in bulky all-body overgarments
could be glimpsed circling around in-
side the mess. One worker was making
passes in the air, others were spraying
ropy foam over everything in sight
from large bladders slung over their
backs. A loud bell was clanging some-
where off to the right down the street.
“It sounds like the subscription ﬁre
brigade’s heading in this direction,

anyway,” said Max. “Have you signed
up yet?”
“Yes, Max,” Roni told him. “It’s all
set.”
Haddo had led Wroclaw off to the
side. “Dangerous business see you how
much?” Haddo hissed at him.
“Anyone can fall victim to an indus-
trial accident,” said Wroclaw. He was
watching the declining ﬁre carefully,
though.
“Danger is not so much from sin-
gle batch of potion,” Haddo continued.
“When is released energy from ﬁre,
does not potion merely destroy.
Can
change into something else; new can
be powers, unstable can be results. If
combine also different brews into one,
interact can whole, mutate and trans-
form can together they. If escape into
air do they -”
A billow of the black smoke suddenly

separated itself from the column and
fell to the ground in front of them with
a distinct clunk. Looking more like a
hunk of aerated coal than a wisp of
smoke, the thing broke in pieces. Va-
pors coiled up from the exposed center,
but the pieces themselves sizzled and
foamed, apparently melting their way
into the cobblestones. “The results can
be totally unpredictable,” said Wroclaw.
“Yes, Haddo, that is certainly clear.”’
Haddo pointed apocalyptically at the
factory. “Potion batch this was for con-
struction, for automatic alignment of
bricks and walls, for cement and mor-
tar. If escape it had, created it would
have fallout.
Glued together would
have fallout whatever it touched.
Or
maybe even worse could have been. To
predict is impossible.” He jerked his
black-cloaked arm up to point back
over his shoulder. “In building behind

us more dangerous is potential by ten.
By hundred? Who can say? Problem
here is - can size of danger say no one!”
Wroclaw had his arms folded be-
hind his back, which considering the
arrangement of his joints was a rather
disconcerting sight, and was whistling
an atonal tune as he watched the newly
arrived ﬁre brigade lay down an extra
band of containment spells while a
pair of burly black-clad bruisers unlim-
bered a long coiled hose that ran back
to the large water tank strapped to
their wagon. “So what are you getting
at, Haddo? What is your point?”
“Have known you now long time,
have I. Know you rash am I not.”
Haddo took a deep breath, or whatever
it was he actually did underneath that
cloak. “Must ensure we that research
of Ronibet proceed does not.”
“Indeed.
Are you proposing this

as Haddo the individual, Sorcerer-at-
Large?” asked Wroclaw, with his typ-
ically dry manner.
“Or is something
larger at work here?”
“Haddo alone am I. What mean you
-”
“In that case,” Wroclaw said in a
clear note of ﬁnality, “we have nothing
further to discuss. Seeing as how that
is plainly not the truth,” he added.
“Of you speak what?”
“You might reconsider that aggrieved
tone, my cloaked friend,” suggested
Wroclaw.
“Especially when you are
trying to win someone to your point of
view. Much evidence indicates you are
up to far more than you are willing to
admit.
There was, for example, your
other friend hiding in the hold of the
ship. There is also our employer Kar-
lini’s present miserable state, which
owes much to you. Unless I am gravely

mistaken?”
“Down keep your voice,” grumbled
Haddo. “Mistaken are you not. If be
that way will you, tell you must I. In
cabal involved am I. In league of not-
humans. Danger to not-humans ﬁght
we; resist we gods of humans.”
“That much has been clear for some
time.
Yet only now you say this is a
matter for ‘we,’ in which you now in-
clude me?
And now in your dangers
to non-humans you include our employ-
ers?”
“Speak you to Favored should you,”
Haddo muttered.
“Your friend from the hold, is that?
Yet at the moment I am speaking to
you. I’m afraid you will have to make
your own points.”
Down the block, the knot of onlook-
ers was beginning to break up along
with the ﬁre.
Roni, having had had

her ﬁll of near-disasters for the morn-
ing, was gazing in another direction.
“What do you suppose Wroclaw and
Haddo are talking about over there?”
she asked.
“Plotting
insurrection
no
doubt,
dear,” said the Great Karlini.
Max gave him a sharp glance, then
turned to scrutinize the pair down the
block as well. “If that’s what you think,
you’d better get rid of them.”
“Whatever happened to your sense
of humor?” Karlini said quickly. “You
never used to be this bad. Now you’ve
got that quiet steely tone of voice all
the time. You’re getting positively too
deadly for me.”
“It’s a deadly business,” Max told
him. “Haddo and Wroclaw, eh? Hmm.
I’d better put them on my list.”
“Max -” said Roni.
“They’re on a break, Max,” said Kar-

lini. “They’re adults, they’re entitled to
shoot the breeze if they want to. Well,
Wroclaw’s an adult. Who knows what
Haddo is.”
Max was now clearly ignoring him.
“You concentrate on your research and
leave this other stuff to me. I’d better
get moving. See you all later.” Without
a glance back he headed off down the
street.
“He’s starting to scare me,” said Kar-
lini.
“He needs to be in love,” Roni pro-
nounced.
“Yep, you’re right,” said her husband.
“That solves everything, you bet.”
Roni glared at him, looked for a
moment as though she were about to
punch him in the stomach, then turned
and stalked through the door.
“Breaking up the old gang,” said Za-
lzyn Shaa, “are we then.”

“Not you too,” Karlini muttered. “I
- oh, forget it.” He made his own glow-
ering exit, punctuating the gesture by
slamming the door behind him.
“Let this be a lesson to you,” Shaa
told the Monts, standing in matched
slack-jaw amazement at the shaking
door, “on the limitations of promised
panaceas.”
“I thought they loved each other,”
said Jurtan.
“Karlini and Ronibet? Oh, they do,
they do; you can tell by the level of
annoyance. As you can see, that’s the
problem, or part of it, at least. Now if
you’ll excuse me, it appears to be the
time for timely exits. I -”
“What was that?” Tildy asked, star-
ing down the street in the direction
Max had taken.
“It sounded like a
building fell over. And look - a cloud
of dust rising up over the roof there,

around the corner. What kind of place
is this?”
Shaa had a discerning ear cocked.
“Not an entire building; more like a cor-
nice, or perhaps an upper-story facade.
I will investigate on my way out. As I
started to say before, I believe I have a
ball to prepare for.”
“Wait!” said Tildy. “You just -” But
Shaa was already strolling away up the
street in the direction of Wroclaw and
Haddo.
They watched him go. “Okay,” Jur-
tan said, “so what was the lesson?”
“I think we’ll know when it’s already
happened. Are you going to run off now
too?”
“If I don’t it means I’ve probably
failed some test, but who cares? How
about we go try to grab a decent meal?”
“Are you sure you’re really my brother
Tildy murmured.

“What do you mean by that?”
“I - oh, forget it.”
Shaa, on his slow amble down the
street, had drawn abreast of Haddo
and Wroclaw. They had fallen silent as
he approached.
Shaa paused, turned
to inspect once more the remains of the
ﬁre, and said, out of the corner of his
mouth, “Whether or not you two are
plotting insurrection - which is not, if
you want to know my feelings, a nec-
essarily bad idea - you might want to
take prudent precautions.
Maximil-
lian seems to have developed a certain
unhealthy suspicion of anyone who
chooses to stay around him.” Without
waiting for a response, he turned again
and continued on along the street.
“What was that about?” said Wro-
claw.
“Of plots have we surplus,” Haddo
told him. “Of which speaking, me ex-

cuse please.”
Svin was now standing alone in front
of the building. Haddo scuttled up next
to him and hissed, “Remember you con-
versation had we on ship, in hold?”
Svin continued gazing across the
street at the ﬁre brigade. “Yes. I re-
member,” he said.
“We talked about
Dortonn. We talked about Haddo, Fist
of Dortonn.”
“Old history about worry not,” Haddo
told him. “Important only are current
events. Important is that -”
“Do not tell me new stories,” Svin
rumbled conversationally. “Do not try
to confound me. Do not try to trick me.
First tell me this. When you escaped
from Dortonn, why did you not return
to ﬁght for the freedom of your people?”
“Did not say same Haddo am I, but
-”
“There is no but. I will not listen to

you.”
“Wait!” Haddo spat. “Go not inside.
Extortionist is becoming everyone.” He
took a breath.
“Things are the way
things are; the only sane philosophy
this is. No point there is to ﬁght power
structure that stronger than you is.”
“I see,” said Svin. “This makes you a
mere creature of fate. It is an interest-
ing attitude, but one I reject. The way
is not destined. It is the duty of a true
warrior to challenge fate, to ﬁght these
power structures of yours.
Whether
you fail is not the point. The point is to
challenge.”
“Very nice.
Not of us all warriors
born are. Now -”
“As I am learning,” Svin said thought-
fully, “there are many more kinds of
warriors than just barbarians with
swords.”
“To me listen!” croaked Haddo. “Sus-

pect I in town is Dortonn.”
“In Peridol? Now?”
“In or coming soon is. On river at-
tacked Dortonn the boat. Hunting me
he is.”
“I see,” said Svin.
“Complete you your quest can you.
Prepare you Dortonn to face you must.
Plan must we for him.”
Svin’s gaze didn’t waver from the
now-departing ﬁre-ﬁghters across the
street. “I am ready now. But we can
plan.
Planning is good.
If what you
say is true, a plan will be valuable.
Dortonn is strong.”
“True it is,” Haddo told him. “True
it is.” Well, he thought to himself, went
that well enough. And it hadn’t even
been a complete deceit.
What was
Max’s favorite word?
Misdirection,
that was it.

Chapter15
I COULD HAVE BEEN UP AND
OUT AT THE CRACK OF DAWN,
but I wasn’t sure there was much of a
point. The streets were as crowded at
dawn as any other time of the day or
night so I wouldn’t exactly be beating
the rush, and anyway my ﬁrst stop
of the morning wouldn’t be open un-
til later.
I’d end up hanging around
either way, on one end or the other. I
ﬁgured I’d take advantage of some of

the amenities the Adventurers’ Club
provided for just this sort of slack time.
Not surprisingly,
the gymnasium
and sparring rooms sprawled over a
signiﬁcant slice of ground.
I teased
out some of my kinks from the road
and then went a few rounds with
a sword-trainer.
Monoch wasn’t too
pleased when I chose a blade from
the practice rack rather than him, but
I wanted to work out, not dismantle
the trainer and demolish the facility.
I also wanted to see if my blackouts
were random enough to incapacitate
me in the middle of a ﬁght. If I didn’t
lose consciousness while sparring that
wouldn’t necessarily tell me anything,
but it still seemed like an exercise
worth running.
In the event,
the whole session
was routine.
The practice grounds
were crowded, but everyone there was

pretty serious; I couldn’t spot a single
entourage or idle hanger-on.
Some
were a bit the worse for wear, thanks
to various injuries in some cases or one
of the Club’s bars the night before in
others. I could have been out carous-
ing myself, but after my session with
Phlinn Arol and the earlier events
of the day it seemed wiser to lie low
and meditate on the situation.
Look-
ing at the bleary-eyed faces around
me reinforced the validity of the lying
low part, if not necessarily the medi-
tation.
Not everyone around me was
human, of course, and the number of
apparent free-lancers seemed roughly
balanced by those in some ofﬁcial ca-
pacity. At least a half-dozen of the men
and women I saw at the gym displayed
the characteristic dress of someone in
the Imperial hierarchy. Here a ﬁnger,
there a shin, on someone else the line

of a rib were picked on their clothing
in silver against black or some other
contrasting color combination.
With-
out a guidebook or a long careful study
it was next to impossible to tell ex-
actly who outranked whom or what
the function of their ofﬁce might ac-
tually be, but you could still make a
rough guess; especially here, where
they were mostly Bones, Muscles, or
Ligaments.
The conceptual structure of Impe-
rial ofﬁcialdom made sense, it was
the implementation that got confusing.
As the structure of their body charac-
terizes the individual, so civilization is
given structure through the body of the
State. That’s the way the ofﬁcial credo
ran, anyway I according to the guide-
books that had been provided with
my room. The Muscles were military,
the Bones administration, Ligaments

handled interior affairs and civic ser-
vices, Nerves and Liver were thinkers
of various sorts, and so forth.
After
as many generations as the system
had had to evolve and twist around on
itself, though, the organization resem-
bled more of an overgrown bramble
hedge that hadn’t been pruned in a
few decades than a neat hierarchy.
Some positions had become hereditary,
some were tied to particular functional
posts - the administrator of Roosing
Oolvaya’s province, for example, was
always a Femur - and some had cor-
respondences with a real body that
could only be fulﬁlled if that body was
a serious mutant. The listings of ofﬁce
in the guidebook had included at least
four other Femurs but at least twice
that number of Patellas. The closer in
to the torso you got, though, and the
higher up toward the head, the better

you were doing.
Since a Knitting generally resulted
in a wholesale shufﬂe of ofﬁceholders,
ﬁlled with promotions and purges both,
everyone who was smart brought them-
selves and as much of their power base
as was mobile to Peridol for the season;
that was part of what helped to feed
the crowds outside. I didn’t see any rea-
son to get involved and was hoping no
one would ﬁnd one for me. I had my
hands full just trying to keep up with
the politics of the gods.
After awhile I had clearly spent
enough time, so I got cleaned up and
put together and hit the street.
The
guidebook had also contained a good
set of maps, ﬁlled with landmarks,
sights to see, and shortcuts. The land-
marks were a mixture of the straight-
forward and the idiosyncratic. At the
end of Temple Row in the Ediﬁce Quar-

ter, for instance, the Temple of Jab-
Bonita was noted as the site of the
most spectacular ecclesiastical theft
in modern times, when a lone free-
booter had succeeded in traversing the
Moat of Whirling Octopuses and the
distortion ﬁelds to reach the efﬁgy of
Jab-Bonita itself, had somehow made
it up the inverted incline of polished
marble at the efﬁgy’s base, through
the ring of smoke, and through the
ceaselessly writhing ramiﬁcations of
the god’s tentacular seat to reach the
door, hidden from sight from below,
through which the acolytes emerged
to conduct Jab-Bonita’s characteristic
ritual. The interloper had proceeded to
follow the acolytes’ passage back down
through the interior of the efﬁgy and
the root of the marble base to the se-
cret quarters beneath the temple, had
eluded the acolytes while making his

way through the maze of passages to
the vault containing Jab-Bonita’s staff
of ofﬁce, had obtained (in a manner
nicely glossed over) the staff and other
accouterments of ofﬁce, and had ﬁnally
used these tokens to unseat Jab-Bonita
himself and steal his godhood. To me,
it all sounded more like misdirection;
it had probably been an inside job. On
the other hand, I guess the new Jab-
Bonita was entitled to spread whatever
myths he wanted to about himself. It
came with the territory.
If I ran into him I could ask him.
Another area clearly marked by the
guidebook was the public area of the
palace complex. The road to the recom-
mended gate passed through the wide
meadow that encircled the outer wall.
The tall panels of the gate themselves
had been thrown wide, leaving an open-
ing high enough for a large giraffe to

have strolled in fully upright and sufﬁ-
ciently broad for a good ten elephants
to have marched through comfortably
abreast. Even this outer wall was so
thick that it could easily accommodate
the matching set of gate panels on the
inner surface. Of course, the wall had
been built at a time when symbolism
was the last thing on anyone’s mind;
the practicality of repelling attack had
been the foremost concern.
According to the guidebook, however,
the palace never had been assaulted.
The other sets of walls along the banks
of the Tongue Water, combined with
Peridol’s fortunate island geography,
had proved the key defenses.
In al-
lowing Peridol the chance to pull itself
from the mess left by the Dislocation
before anyone else on the continent,
they had directly paved the way for
Peridol’s march to its present world

mastery. The Tongue Water defenses
were long since dismantled but the
palace remained, its symbolism now
unmistakable.
But symbols were scarcely the morn-
ing’s business, or sightseeing either. I
made my way through the public gar-
dens, skirted the dour warrens of the
bureaucracy, where even now new con-
struction was appending an additional
three-story wing,
and followed the
signposts into a much grander build-
ing and down a polished corridor hung
with unrecognizable portraits and a
tasteful array of statuary. Another set
of double-height doors beckoned; this
was obviously the place. Through the
doorway was a hall with a high domed
ceiling faced around with windows,
the marble ﬂoor arrayed with chairs
and wide tables, and the walls lined
with books.
Books in the thousands,

at least, or tens of thousands, or quite
possibly the millions. I had never seen
so many books - and scrolls, and screen-
writings, and periodicals, and on and
on - in my life. But then this was the
library, or the Library, to give it its
proper due. Or the Archives? Anyway,
here I was. And the only thing I could
think, detective or not, was that I’d
better get some help.
Well, the desk in the middle of the
room was obviously the librarian’s. As
I ambled over, I saw I wouldn’t have to
wait long. The woman in the chair had
only a single customer before me, an-
other Imperial functionary in fact, so
I ﬁgured I’d hang around ostentatiusly
enough so she could see I was next.
The librarian didn’t seem all that
happy with the guy, actually, based on
the sour expression that kept breaking
through on her face. She kept taking

her spectacles off and putting them
on, and had edged back in her chair
as the guy persisted in leaning closer
across the desk.
The guy obviously
took his own workouts seriously and
had the costume to show off the re-
sults, a ﬂashy number in black and
red with the silver emblem of his ofﬁce
spread across his shoulder blade. As I
surreptitiously watched them, though,
the ﬁgure he cut was more that of a
masher than a seeker of knowledge
and reference materials. I edged closer,
trying to decide if there was any good
reason to intervene.
While purring into her ear, the guy
made a grab for one of the librar-
ian’s hands.
She managed to elude
him, though, and slid her chair back
with a loud screech against the ﬂoor.
The man straightened and started to
move around the desk himself, which

is when my own boot made a promi-
nent squeak on the ﬂoor.
I coughed
once or twice, and was prepared to
clear my throat a few times or even
gargle, for good measure, but the man
did stop.
He unhooded his striking
blue eyes and cast a sharp look at me,
but apparently could draw no serious
information from the gloom under the
hood of the overcloak I’d acquired from
the supplier back at the club.
“Until
tonight, then, my dear,” he murmured
to the librarian, and glided off.
With that expression on her face she
sure didn’t look like she was happy
being that guy’s dear, or more prob-
ably anyone’s.
He’d looked vaguely
familiar, like I might have seen him
someplace, but unless I’d had another
dream where he’d shown up that I’d
otherwise forgotten I couldn’t think of
where it might have been. The librar-

ian shook her head and transferred her
attention to me. “How can I help you?”
she asked.
“I’m a detective. In fact, that’s what
brings me here in the ﬁrst place. I’m
doing some research for a case.”
“A detective?” She was squinting at
me as though she might have seen me
somewhere, too, only in her case she
probably had; striking a heroic pose on
a wall no doubt.
“Yeah,” I said, “that’s right. Maybe I
should be asking you how I can help.”
“I wish I knew what he was up to,”
she said, almost to herself.
I’d been concentrating on my own
business far too much lately, anyway.
I needed to clear my head.
I needed
somebody else’s totally unrelated prob-
lem to worry about. This was sort of
my kind of job, after all. “If you like I
could keep an eye on him. Maybe I can

ﬁnd out.”
“No, no, I’m sure there’s no need.
Anyway, he’s powerful. He’s dangerous.
He’s the Scapula.”
“I’m not exactly a sheet of dough my-
self, m’am. It would be a pleasure.”
She looked at me while obviously
considering the situation. “Well,” she
said ﬁnally, “perhaps.
Thank you for
your offer regardless.”
“You’re welcome,” I told her. I was
considering some things myself. What
had come over me?
What was I do-
ing drumming up business at a time
like this? It did feel comfortable, right
somehow, the same way I’d reacted
when I’d thought about getting an
ofﬁce.
Something in me was much
happier when I was following what it
thought my role in life should be. That
didn’t necessarily make the rest of me
feel better, though.
Again it felt as

though something was trying to reat-
tach me to a hook that I’d somehow
been designed to ﬁt.
Another side-
effect of the Spell of Namelessness?
Well, maybe the material in this li-
brary would help me ﬁnd out. “Excuse
me?”
“Your research,” she said.
“For a
case.”
“Right.
I’ve got a client under the
Spell of Namelessness. I need to ﬁnd
out whatever I can about this thing
and how it works, and especially if
there’s a list of folks who’ve had it
directed at them.”
Her expression turned dubious.
“I
doubt the holdings have much that
will help you.
Gods and sorcerers
aren’t known for documenting their
intrigues, especially if the loser has
passed from the scene.”
I spread my hands. “Whatever.”

“I’ll show you to the stacks,” the li-
brarian said, getting up. I trailed her
toward the maze of tall shelves. “Have
you visited the Temple of the Curse?
That is the Curse Master’s primary
contact-spot.
If you tell them you’re
thinking of commissioning a Curse of
Namelessness against someone per-
haps they’d give you information on its
past employment.”
“That’s an idea.” The thought of seek-
ing Jardin out under my own power
had the virtue of audacity, but some-
how its overall wisdom seemed ques-
tionable. She didn’t have to know that,
though.
She was frowning at shelves as we
passed. Then she nodded up ahead, at
an area in a cage, with a locked grill-
work door. “The magic and god-related
material is restricted access.
You’ll
have to ring for me to let you out, so

perhaps you’ll tell me then whether
you’ve found what you need. I’ll think
about it too; maybe rummage around a
bit. Perhaps there’s something more I
can turn up.”
“I’d really appreciate that.” As she
unlocked the door and led me in, point-
ing the way to the shelf she thought
would be of greatest relevance, I had
a new question to turn over in my
mind.
If this was a restricted access
area, why was she letting me in, and
so easily, too? What made me an ap-
proved researcher? It couldn’t be just
my claim to be a detective. Could it?
Well, probably I was just starting to
see plots around each corner and under
every bed. As the door shut behind me
with a mufﬂed clang I turned my atten-
tion to the books.
Then I turned my
attention back from the books, to the
almost imperceptible scuff of a foot I

heard behind me down the row to my
right. The man who had been hidden
down the aisle was just looking up at
me as I looked around at him.
Although he tried to conceal it, he
was clearly a lot more surprised than
I was, but then it took an ever-more-
remarkable occasion to get me aston-
ished these days. “That was a pretty
cute trick you pulled on me,” I told him.
“Shh,” said Fradjikan, sliding his
book back onto the shelf. “This is a li-
brary. One must behave with decorum.
What trick is that?”
“Setting me up to ﬁght that ani-
mated statue and then getting my face
plastered all over town as a result,
and don’t tell me it was a coincidence
because we both know it wasn’t.”
“How could I -”
“Look, Ballista,” I began; but then,
seeing the confusion ebb and the ex-

pression of calm mastery begin to set-
tle back on his face at the sound of that
name, I decided to change tack. “You’ve
been lying to me since you picked me
up out there on the road, starting with
who you are, Fradjikan.”
He blinked, his hand snaking as if by
reﬂex to the hilt of his sword. “Why do
you call me that?” he said unconvinc-
ingly.
“The usual reason,” I said.
“Be-
cause it’s your name.” That wasn’t the
only thing I realized I knew about
Fradjikan.
Assassin, subversive-at-
large, kingpin and kingmaker, one-
time Grand Shroud of the Society of
Masks - no wonder Gash had this infor-
mation to pass me. Fradjikan sounded
like just his kind of guy. “What are you
doing here?”
“Leaving,” he replied.
I moved to put my back at the door

and hefted the walking stick.
Frad-
jikan walked toward me with his con-
trolled sword-master’s glide. His sword
was still slung, but I knew there was
only a half-second difference between
having it on his hip and having it in his
hand entering my chest. On the other
hand, he’d seen Monoch in action; that
had to give him pause. On the other
hand, a library was the last place I’d
want to get into a ﬁght wielding a de-
molisher like Monoch.
All those dry
pages mixed up with a ﬂaming sword
wouldn’t be pretty. “We should discuss
your game,” I stated.
“Perhaps we should,
but this is
scarcely the place.”
“Can you think of a better neutral
ground?”
“Most probably,” he whispered.
“Yet the here and now has its advan-
tages.”

“Whatever those may be, they cer-
tainly
pale.”
He
continued
moving
ahead, showing every intent of strolling
straight through my body if it hap-
pened to still be there when he arrived.
I wasn’t about to attack and he
wasn’t about to talk, so we could ei-
ther stand there at an impasse or get
about our own businesses. I shrugged
and stepped aside. Instead of pulling
the call-bell cord, Fradjikan did some-
thing to the lock and swung open the
door. He grinned an uneasy grin at me
through the grillwork as he eased the
door shut again, making sure the lock
engaged, and then turned and strode
quickly out of sight through the stacks.
Somehow I didn’t think he’d come
into the restricted-stack area the same
way I had, either, with the assistance
of the librarian; the air about him
had been just a little too furtive even

before we’d started sparring.
Also,
the librarian might have mentioned
that someone was already in here, or
she might have glanced around when
we’d entered to see where he was. Of
course, she could have just been a
touch absent-minded.
More plots un-
der the bed? I’d ask her about him on
the way out.
But ﬁrst things ﬁrst. I was torn be-
tween following Fradjikan right away
or doing the research I’d come there
for.
Actually, there wasn’t much of a
choice. I’d better do the research; who
knew when I’d get back to it otherwise?
Too bad I didn’t know any operatives
here in Peridol. It would be nice to hire
somebody to help with the legwork.
Maybe the Adventurers’ place could
get me a referral.
Before my own research, however,
there was still something new worth

investigating. I went down the aisle to
the spot Fradjikan had been standing.
Which book had he been looking at?
Here was one still partially out-of-line.
I withdrew it and puzzled out the ti-
tle. The language was . . . Chafreshi, a
tongue I didn’t recall a prior familiarity
with, but what else was new. Arundi’s
Weapons and Armor?
Then I realized what the book was.
A text and encyclopedia of magical
weaponry. Unless I missed my guess,
Fradi had been trying to look up
Monoch.
That wasn’t a bad idea.
I ﬂipped
the pages. The text was fairly dense;
Arundi apparently enjoyed watching
himself write, but was less concerned
with anyone else’s ability to read. The
ﬁrst part of the book was theoretical
rather than descriptive.
Arundi pre-
sented a long discussion on the design

tradeoffs in embedding magic in an
implement. On the simplest level was
the sheer infusion of power, or power
feeding a simple onboard spell (such as
an edge-maintainer or an active saw
effect or even the odd ﬂame-burst), but
such power boosts were only good for
a limited amount of activity. The ﬁrst
real trick came in when you added a
recharger, I learned.
Vampire-mode
recharging, for example, worked by si-
phoning life-energy out of the weapon’s
victim. This was powerful but not too
versatile, and without surge cutouts
you could suck up too much too fast
and have a blowout.
On the other
hand, low-intensity modes could renew
themselves in a whole host of ways.
Even leaving the weapon out in the
sun for awhile would sometimes do it.
And then there was the topic of ac-
tive versus passive. The more helpful

you wanted an instrument to be, the
more of your own smarts you had to
program into it, and the more intelli-
gence you gave it the better the chance
it had of going past you to develop its
own.
Once that happened the imple-
ment was as much an independent
actor as the property of its creator.
This could be a good thing or a bad
thing.
In introducing the possibility
that the object might come up with its
own goals in life, and an agenda that
might differ from that of its wielder, a
serious element of negotiation entered
the relationship. Arundi devoted sev-
eral chapters to the question of how to
convince a magical device to do what
you wanted it to, and of how to protect
yourself against it if you couldn’t.
According to Arundi the associa-
tion between complexity and intelli-
gence was a topic of major debate.

Whether complexity produced actual
intelligence and true self-awareness or
merely a simulation thereof did sound
interesting, from a purely philosoph-
ical standpoint, and for all I knew it
could have some practical signiﬁcance,
but darned if I could think at the mo-
ment just where that would be; and
anyway I had a lot more to do than
time to do it in. The stuff on How to
Relate to Your Weapon, though, did
seem to smack of relevance. I settled
in to read.
After a few pages I was seriously
wondering if Arundi had ever been in
the same room with a creature such
as Monoch.
He had anecdotes, sure,
but I already had my own share of
those myself.
I also had a lot more
practical information on what worked
and what didn’t. I ﬂipped ahead to the
long appendix.
There I was greeted

by panel after panel of illustrated hal-
berds,
buskirks,
shields,
hand-axes,
saddles, self-aiming grappling irons,
and swords, swords, swords.
After a
few pages of metallurgical analyses I
never wanted to hear about tin con-
tent again, or forging descriptions, or
where Famous Weapon X had picked
up this nick or had gotten that chunk
removed. The details of the engravings
included as reference plates had their
worthwhile parts, though.
Between
the
narrative
walkthroughs
of
the
holdings of this museum’s collection,
or that armory’s, and the armamen-
tarium wielded by this or that other
legendary ravager of continents, it was
hard to remember that this stuff was
supposed to be interesting.
I could add Arundi to my list of folks
I’d have some words for if I ever caught
up with them.

There was no sign of Monoch in his
book, though.
He had a section on
paraphernalia hidden in various parts
of the scenery, staffs in trees, swords
in anvils, and whatnot, but these were
accompanied by literal illustrations
that made it clear that these were not
cases of cloaks or disguises but rather
riddles or curses or traps of one sort
or another. Arundi did prove to have
a section on transubstantiations, but
it was uncharacteristically short and
elliptical.
I shoved the book back on
the shelf. I could stand around read-
ing all day and still never come across
anything useful except by luck.
This
wasn’t the way to do it at all. What I
needed to ﬁnd was somebody who’d al-
ready read all this stuff, and had some
experience under their belt to boot.
What I needed wasn’t only a legman, I
needed a research assistant. I should

ask Shaa, or Karlini. They knew these
kinds of folks.
The way things had
been going lately maybe one of them
wanted the job.
I made my way back around the
shelves to the location the librarian
had
shown
me
and
started
going
through the volumes I found there.
I quickly discovered a disappointing
similarity to Arundi.
Where Arundi
had been long on picayune facts, these
histories of the gods were heavy with
what sounded suspiciously like gossip;
unfortunately, neither of them seemed
concerned at telling the reader what he
actually might want to know. The Spell
of Namelessness did pop up here and
there. It was clearly just another tool,
though, traditionally favored by the
Curse Administrator but used more
widely than that. One writer thought
that sorcerer Iskendarian had devel-

oped it, but since another book men-
tioned its use a hundred years before
the earliest date quoted for Iskendar-
ian’s activity perhaps he’d just made it
popular.
As far as lists went, it looked as
though Phlinn Arol was right. There
were too many documented or sus-
pected
victims
of
Namelessness
to
make
it
anything
like
convenient.
Don’t get me wrong, I wrote them down.
Forty-eight gods spread out over three
hundred years, and maybe another
hundred others, magicians and politi-
cians and heroes-on-quest, mostly, but
quite a few of them just names, or
even ﬂat statements like “another half-
dozen victims during Holito’s sweep
through the South” - how was I sup-
posed to know if one of those was me
mixed in there?
None of the names
sounded familiar.

Well, maybe I’d get an insight while
I was off doing something else. I rang
for the librarian, and soon I was back
on the street with directions to the
Scapula’s major haunts. I’d slung my
cloak back over my head, of course,
and tried to stay as far away from
those damned broadsheets as possible,
so it took me awhile before I realized
that the posters up this morning were
not identical to the ones I’d seen before.
I had to come around a blind corner
and almost walk straight into the one
plastered on the facing wall to notice
the difference.
I was still there ﬁghting off the
statue with Monoch; that much was
still the same, but now, strings ran
upward from the horse’s limbs, and the
big sword and the rider, to a set of out-
stretched hands rendered jerking and
bobbing in a dance of control. Hanging

in the air between them, right above
the stone general, its expression cap-
tured in a moment of devilish glee, was
the face of my erstwhile pal Maximil-
lian, the Vaguely Disreputable.
I stopped in the middle of my step
to stare. Passersby weaved around me
and merely cursed under their breaths,
but no one actually tried to shove me
out of the way.
Perhaps there was
something about me at that moment
that warned them off.
If so, I hoped
I could recapture it later on, when
I’d certainly need all the help I could
get. Against Max? Against Fradjikan?
Against Jardin? Against Phlinn Arol?
Who knew any more who I’d end up
ﬁghting and who’d actually turn out to
be on my side?
But the outline of what Fradjikan
was up to might be coming clearer. If
he was the one behind the posters, and

there was no reason to doubt it, his
plot involved not only me but Max;
or perhaps his plot had always been
aimed at Max and I’d only gotten in
the way.
Max had powerful enemies,
among them at least some of the gods
themselves, or so he’d maintained. It
looked like Fradjikan was one of them.
I’d been trying to stay clear of Max but
this changed things. I’d better get word
to him. Max would see the broadsheets
too - he couldn’t miss them unless he
was asleep - so he’d know something
was going on. But I knew about Frad-
jikan.
Of course, Max would see me on the
poster too. He might think I was part
of the plot.
It looked like I was, too,
one way or another, but Max might de-
cide it was deliberate on my part. And
he might decide the best course was to
take me apart to ﬁnd out what I knew

...
Shaa; again, Shaa. I’d tell him and
let him tell Max. I’d been in the library
longer than I’d thought, though, and I
didn’t know how long I’d stood around
thinking in the street either. It looked
to be mid-afternoon already. I’d proba-
bly be too late to catch Shaa at home
before he left.
On the other hand, I
wasn’t that far from the Scapula’s ad-
dress, and I had told the librarian I’d
check into him.
I got myself moving
again.
The librarian, Leen, in telling me
how to ﬁnd the Scapula’s principal
residence, had concluded by saying I
couldn’t miss it.
Arriving at the lo-
cation she’d described I understood
more fully what she’d meant. He had
a walled compound that occupied an
entire block.
It wasn’t a very large
block, but it was a pretty intimidat-

ing wall, stout with neatly laid stones
and topped with spikes and radiating
the telltale glow of active magic. Veg-
etation was pruned back and no trees
grew close enough to drape themselves
over the top. The broad driveway gate
in the front was hung with sheeting,
too, keeping the inside courtyard free
from prying eyes, and whatever build-
ings the compound contained were set
back far enough to be out of sight from
the street as well. The only outward
sign that connected this place with the
Scapula were the twin ﬂagpoles setting
off each side of the gate, one with the
ensign of Peridol and the other show-
ing a silver shoulder blade against a
background of black and red.
As I circled the block, looking for a
decent vantage point to stake things
out, an even more telling observation
became apparent.
The walls weren’t

only clean of vines and shrubbery, they
were unblemished by posters.
True,
the palace complex had been lack-
ing the broadsheets as well, but out
here in the city this was the ﬁrst
location I’d seen free of their other-
wise omnipresent blare. The message
was clear.
Even the anonymous free-
lance street propagandists and ﬂy-by-
nighters didn’t dare cross this guy.
But I was different, right? I’d stroll
in where wimps feared to tread, which
either said something about my com-
mon sense or my intelligence, if not
both, and I was certain neither com-
ment would be all that complimentary.
Of course I wasn’t actually strolling in
anywhere, either, so maybe it would
balance out, or so I was thinking as
I rounded the corner into the alley at
the back of the Scapula’s block. As I’d
surmised, there was a back door as

well, a smaller one, suited for individ-
uals afoot or horsed, or possibly even
a compact carriage. At the moment it
was open, and in the process of admit-
ting a single man alone and on foot.
He ﬁnished slinking in and the gate
closed quickly behind him, but I was
left standing in a muddle at the corner
with my mouth agape.
I shut my mouth; that part at least
was easy enough to handle. The mud-
dle was a more difﬁcult matter. Which
one of them had I been tailing? No, it
was the Scapula; there was no doubt
about that. I’d only thought about fol-
lowing Fradjikan. So why was he mak-
ing things convenient for me?
What
business did he have with the Scapula?
Could I overhear their conversation?
Something - Gash’s senses operating
through the metabolic link, I guess -
was warning me it would be dangerous,

very dangerous, to try to sneak inside.
But what else might I be able to do
with those same senses? I closed my
eyes and concentrated.
Focus, I told
myself, focus on sounds, and indeed
after a moment I did start to become
more fully aware of the activity around
me, of the cawing of a crow overhead,
of the rattlings and mutterings of a
man in his rough lean-to of sticks and
castoff burlap in the alley across from
the Scapula’s wall, of the yapping of a
dog pattering along behind a ragpicker
toting his sack-o’-cloths, of a troop of
horsepeople on the main street at the
front of the compound...
Then I re-
alized I wasn’t only hearing all this
bustle, I was seeing it, too, as though
through a roving eye that jumped and
zoomed from spot to spot, bobbing and
weaving through the air.
Even though my real eyes were

closed,
this roving vision was still
murky, indistinct.
It wasn’t seeing
so much as visualizing, if you will;
it was too schematic for out-and-out
sight. But that didn’t mean it wasn’t
timely. Could I send my new vantage
point over the wall? The roaming eye
darted up and arched over.
Crackle – BLAMM! Blinding light
ﬂashed behind my eyelids as some-
thing the size of an ox kicked me in the
head, only from the inside out...
For all I know I lost consciousness;
probably I did.
Gradually I remem-
bered who I was, I mean as much as I
ever did, although the roar of the ox in
my ears and its continuous stamping
on my forehead didn’t help matters any.
The ox was growing smaller, though,
maybe shrinking to the size of a goat,
but its access to my head was facili-
tated by the fact that I seemed to be

lying full-length on my back in the
mud.
Obviously
the
Scapula’s
defenses
could go after something like my rov-
ing eye. I thought I’d better get out of
there; I might have set off an alarm,
too. I still had Monoch, I could feel the
stick in my hand, but a fat lot of good
he’d done me this time. If Arundi had
been right, an implement of his caliber
should be giving warnings and ad-
vice, and should have helped to blunt
the damage from attacks as an exten-
sion of his personal protection ﬁeld.
Monoch hadn’t been doing any of that.
Arundi had suggested techniques for
making your magical assistant earn its
keep, but for some reason I didn’t seem
to be able to think of any right at the
moment. In fact -
“Taking a nap, are we?”
There was a woman standing over

me. I cranked open my eyes, squinted
against the stab of pain from the alley’s
low light, and said, “What, is it time to
get up already?”
The woman snorted. Had we met? I
didn’t think so, but I thought I might
be on the verge of knowing who she
was anyway.
Maybe another one of
those dreams was trying to break
through.
“There is danger to us all,
and you waste your time wallowing in
mud?”
“There’s always danger,” I told her.
“What else is new? To which danger are
you referring at the moment?”
“Breakdown of the social contract,”
she said, “for one.
For another, folks
who sit on the sidelines while others
are smashing down the boundaries of
good sense.”
I had a feeling she was including re-
clining on the ground in her deﬁnition

of sitting on the sidelines.
Well, per-
haps my head would stand letting me
get to my feet now. I put Monoch’s tip
on the ground, snarled at him mentally
to “Help out, dammit!”, and felt myself
unroll from the mud and jerk up into
the air. My feet even left the ground in
a small hop, stretching my joints with
a chorus of snaps, but when I settled
back down to the ground everything
popped back into place and my balance
held. My head was still pounding. As
I’d said before, though, what else was
new? “So what would you have these
‘folks’ do?” I asked. “If they happen to
get off the sidelines and stand up?”
“Make themselves presentable, for a
ﬁrst step. We’ve got enough problems
with loss of legitimacy without becom-
ing a laughing-stock as well. Here, let
me.”
I gave off my looking around for

a clean cloth or a source of running
water as she stretched her hand out
toward me and passed it slowly down
from my head toward my feet. Aqua-
marine coils wound out around me like
a small tornado. I felt as though some-
thing was scouring my skin with a stiff
brush, but the grime and mud were
lifting free of my clothes and spinning
off into the tornado and showering
onto the ground. In a moment I was
cleaner than I’d been in, well, awhile.
“Thanks,” I said. “That was certainly
timely, as well as handy.”
It also wasn’t the ﬁrst hint I’d had
she was a god.
“The last time I saw
you, weren’t you a palm tree?” I went
on, falling in step with her as she be-
gan walking along the lane toward the
main street.
“Why, didn’t you like it?”
“No, no, not at all,” I said. “I thought

it was clever.
Well-executed, too - I
appreciated what you found to do with
the coconuts.” It had been a palm tree
with a man’s voice, too, but what did
that matter?
At the conclave of the
gods
I’d
attended
from
Oolsmouth,
courtesy of Zhardann and the dis-
guised Gashanatantra, most everyone
but me had worn some persona or an-
other.
Since the conclave had taken
place in an artiﬁcial environment that
didn’t really exist anyway, and since
the attendees were represented not in
the ﬂesh but as projected constructs,
those constructs could take any form
their projectors pleased. I was happy
the gods had that outlet, at least. Play-
ing dress-up and masquerade gave
them a way to posture and show off
without anyone getting hurt.
Of course, there had been Sapriel.
“Yeah, well,” she continued, “when

you’re supposed to be Protector of Na-
ture, you have to spend some time rep-
resenting your constituency.”
“I’d feel the same way,” I told her, “if
I had a constituency myself, of course.”
“Don’t take that abstract air with
me,” she said.
“We all have a con-
stituency, and more than that we have
the needs of our own community. It’s
not
Conservationist/Abdicationist
at
this point. If this goes on it’s whether
there’ll be anything left at all.”
“I think that’s a little apocalyptic,” I
said.
“Well I don’t,” she snapped.
“You
may think you can keep playing your
usual games and pulling your strings
and end up on top of whatever heap is
left, but this time you’re wrong. Things
are getting completely out of control.
Abdicationism may have started this
but it’s not the only destabilizing factor

now by a long shot.”
She was Protector of Nature, right?
Nature had done pretty well under
the gods, all things told, if you left
off things like the continent of Zinar-
ctica; and if you believed what you
heard even Zinarctica was starting to
come back.
If “ground-huggers,” as
she’d called them before, got control of
their own destiny again, they’d prob-
ably mess up the land the same way
they had before the Dislocation. So she
was Conservationist. She thought her
constituency would be better off under
the status quo than under any other
arrangement.
“But what power do I
have?” I said. “What do you expect me
to do about anything?”
“You know something incriminating
about everybody, and don’t say you
don’t.” She didn’t pause at the cor-
ner. No, she stalked around the turn

in the Scapula’s wall without break-
ing stride and charged straight into
a knot of women loaded down with
baskets and wrapped parcels of ﬁsh,
her elbows ﬂying as she cleared her-
self a path.
The women cursed as
they dodged out of the way, and then
muttered again as they began chasing
after stray loaves of bread and a few
errant turnips. I skirted the mess, not
wanting the turnips aimed at me, and
hurried to catch up with her. “If you
called in your markers and used what
you know,” she continued, “you could
stop things dead in their tracks.”
“You’re exaggerating again.”
“Damned if I am.
There’s been
enough of this anarchy and checks
and balances and never getting any-
thing done.
It is time for a change,
but Abdication’s not the one to bet on.
We need a leader to step in and take

charge.”
“An
interesting
concept,”
I
com-
mented.
“I take it you’re not alone
in this thought?”
In following her along the avenue, I
had now drawn abreast of the Scapula’s
main gate. What I had missed by cas-
ing the joint from across the street,
I now discovered, was a small brass
address-plaque afﬁxed to the wall next
to the gate’s hinge-post, and as soon
as I saw the engraving on the plaque
I realized I had forgotten to ask the
Scapula’s original given name.
So that’s why he looked familiar.
It was only about the two-hundredth
time that day, but I had to ask it again.
What was going on? What had I stum-
bled into? What -
Maybe I’d better try to see Shaa now
after all.
But the Protector of Nature wasn’t

ﬁnished with me yet.
“Of course I’m
not alone,” she declared.
“But if you
want us to back you as leader you have
to take an active role.
You have to
demonstrate your willingness to com-
mit yourself.”
“Indeed.
And did you have by any
chance a particular demonstration in
mind?”
She scowled at me.
“There is a
threat present here in Peridol, an ex-
ternal threat, even a signiﬁcant threat;
a threat that has the potential for to-
tally blowing up in all of our faces. We
need more assurance that this threat
will be removed from the scene.
Un-
fortunately he’s under the protection
of Phlinn Arol, that’s what makes it
tricky.”
“He?”
“A human,” she said. “Named Max-
imillian.”

Chapter16
“VERY
WELL.
NOW,
THE
SKY-
ROCKETS. Have you emplaced the
skyrockets?
What are the speciﬁca-
tions?”
Favored-of-the-Gods
pushed
back
from the table, leaned back in his
chair, and looked up.
He spread out
a hand, indicating the graphs, charts,
and lists arrayed along the work area
between them. The large page at the
top of the pile at the moment showed

an artist’s conception of a pavilion
shaped like a half-barrel lying on its
side in the midst of a lawn garden,
its gold ribs glowing against the deep
indigo of a romantic night sky. Multi-
colored sparklers were going off over-
head.
“They’re there,” Favored said.
“The skyrockets are there.
Twenty-
two batteries, all along the perimeter,
just like I promised you.” He swept
the rendering aside and dug through
the heap, coming up with an overhead
terrain map. “Here and here, see, and
all these other spots marked with the
starburst symbol.”
“Yes...” mused a voice in the shudder
of distant thunder. A shadow gathered
itself out of the larger darkness across
from Favored and loomed over the ta-
ble, stretched out a black hand-shaped
something and retrieved the painting
Favored had moved away. “I have in-

spected the new hall. The catering fa-
cilities are most intriguing.”
Favored had set part of the kitchen
out on one edge of the promenade ﬂoor
itself, on a raised dais.
“I’ve jazzed
up those open-pit ovens to spew ﬁre,”
explained Favored.
“Should be like
a cross between a volcano and caged
lightning.”
“A nice touch,” agreed the voice.
“And the earth-rumbler?”
Favored drew a deep breath. “Look,
boss,” he said deferentially.
‘We can
either sit here another hour, me going
back over all the details for you again,
or I can be out at the site ﬁne-tuning
things and supervising the crew.
I’m
not omnipresent like you; I can’t do
both.”
“ ... I do not employ you for your ef-
frontery.”
“No, you keep me around because

I’m good at what I do and I don’t let
you down. So let me get to it, huh?”
The shadow extended itself over Fa-
vored, wrapped him in a clammy fog
with a temperature straight from the
icebox.
The voice shuddered through
his bones.
“Very well.
Fail me and
your ﬂesh will be food for beasts and
your eyes a treat for wild crows; your
soul will be kindling for ﬁre.” Then
the shadow shrank away.
The gloom
retreated; somewhere a door slammed.
“Don’t I know it,” Favored muttered.
But it had gone well.
Zimrat Yaw,
Lord of Storms, was a tough customer
to please.
However, Favored was no
pushover himself, and had worked for
Zimrat Yaw long enough to know how
to play him. Fortunately there weren’t
many of the old-line fundamentalists
left. As far as Favored was concerned,
all that fear, trembling, and terror

stuff - plus the total obedience and the
rigid lifestyle - came back to bite you
in the long run. Not that he’d say that
to Zimrat Yaw, of course. The program
was to keep his head down and wait
for a new Storm Lord, and maybe give
the old one a judicious push when the
timing was right.
Of course, what with one thing and
another the timing was never entirely
right.
On the other hand there were
many periods when the timing was ab-
solutely wrong. Take the present, for
example. Which was undoubtedly why,
of course, Maximillian and that wife of
Karlini’s had chosen the moment to get
as close as they were to causing real
trouble.
Favored swept the documents to-
gether into a neater pile, selected a few
and rolled them up under his arm, but
left the others on the table. He’d pro-

duced them for the Storm Lord’s con-
sumption and as orders for the crew,
not as working-papers; all the impor-
tant information Favored kept in his
memory-system, anyway. Zimrat Yaw,
fundamentalist that he was, would be
displeased to the point of launching
an eradication if he discovered the
memory-system’s existence, but then
virtually everything Favored was re-
ally up to would have the same effect
on any number of gods.
Flotarobolis,
Favored’s sphere-vehicle, sitting off to
the side under a drop-cloth, was an ex-
ception through special dispensation.
Flotarabolis was under a cloth, though
- even dispensations had a way of being
suddenly revoked, especially if they
were waved around one time too many
or a tad too ostentatiously.
At a sharp knock from the door, Fa-
vored, who had been turning in that di-

rection already, said, “Yeah!” The door
opened, admitting the light of day and
a husky man in coveralls, his face the
beaten mahogany of a working life in
the sun. As the daylight dispelled the
last shreds of Zimrat Yaw’s habitual
gloom, it was clear that the building
was basically a shack, and that if not
for the worktable and an assortment
of chairs, the shrouded Flotarabolis,
some wall-charts, and a parafﬁn hot-
plate, it would have been an aban-
doned and derelict shack as well. “Rolf
needs to see you about the mortars,”
the crew chief said.
“Hagbard’s spot-
ted another wagon-load of food coming
in and the access road’s still jammed
where the pavement shifted.
Ham-
per Lo and the gang testing the roof
think one of the bearings needs to be
replaced. Then there’s the caterers...”
Favored followed his assistant out

of the headquarters shack, up the em-
bankment, and out of the copse of trees,
the shack disappearing utterly behind
them. At their left the shoreline of the
lake swooped pleasantly along; ahead
and back from the bank on the right
glittered the new pavilion.
The scaf-
folding was almost all down, and not a
moment too soon. A swarm of workers
were doing everything from tidying the
ﬂower beds and polishing the brass
to stringing the police barricade along
the path at the margin of the meadow.
Beyond the pavilion and its wide con-
toured lawn rose the gray mass of the
palace wall.
The lake swelled as it
approached the wall, wrapped itself
along the stones, and coiled off into
the distance, forming the decorative
moat. A few swells were out on the wa-
ter sculling in punts and families had
begun staking out choice spots on the

opposite shore of the lake. If Favored
had his way he’d be there with them;
the reﬂections of the ﬁreworks in the
water would be a spiffy sight indeed.
“Hagbard ﬁrst,” instructed Favored,
seeing as Hagbard was the closest of
the ones hanging around at the foot of
the pavilion waiting for him anyway.
“Then - what was that?”
“Sounded like a hiss,” said the con-
struction chief.
A hiss it had been, from behind, in
the trees. Beneath one of the trees a
small black shrub appeared to be wav-
ing.
The shrub shifted position, and
they noticed its glowing red eyes.
“I’ll be there in a minute,” Favored
said. “Tell the antsiest ones what we
talked about, or just make up what-
ever’ll work. You know the drill.”
The man went on without a word.
Favored put his head down and charged

back to the trees. “This is a bad time,”
he muttered to the shrub.
“Right have you it,” agreed Haddo,
brushing a stray branch off his cloak.
“Yet never will be time good.”
Favored scowled at the retreating
back of his crew chief. “I never should
have taken that slow boat to get back
here. If Zimrat Yaw knew how big a
mess things were in, here, they’d be
serving me tonight.”
“In command through long distance
were you. Deputies on site you had.”
“Yeah,” said Favored, “and I was
here in person right until the moment
I left for that little jaunt to Oolsmouth,
too, but that excursion took time I
never should have spent.”
“Perfectionist are you,” Haddo said
dismissively. “Important was in Oolsmo
the task.”
“Yeah, yeah, right, tell me some-

thing I don’t already know. Any sign of
Dortonn?”
“Of signs none, yet feel him I do.
Around is he. But with us is now Svin.
Prepared is he.”
“No he isn’t,” Favored observed. “He
may think he is but he isn’t.”
“Matters not.
Matters only his re-
solve. Matters not that knows he not
about ring.”
Favored hesitated. “Okay,” he said.
“Okay. And Wroclaw?”
“Help us he will. Reluctant is he, but
help us he will.”
“They all start off reluctant, but
when they ﬁnd out how deep they’re in
they realize it doesn’t matter because
by then they’ve got no choice.
Like
Karlini, too. It’s time for another push
on him.”
“Think I not,” Haddo said slowly.
“You going sentimental on me again?

We can’t have him out there wafﬂing
back and forth. We either cement him
in our camp or get him off the board.”
“No need is there for muscle.”
“Time gets shorter the further along
his wife gets with her work. You said
there’s a limit to how much you can
slow her down yourself.
So we need
Karlini, right?”
“ ... Right.”
“You are going soft again,” Favored
muttered.
“You can’t win this one
by just grumbling and complaining, or
half measures you don’t follow through.
I’m not gonna bail you out this time. I
can’t. You got it?”
“Urr,” grumbled Haddo. “Time will
have you for Dortonn to search?”
“After we’re ﬁnished here, maybe
late tonight if I’m not too beat. Tomor-
row more likely. See if you can dig up
any more leads ﬁrst.
And ﬁgure out

what we’re going to do about Karlini.”
Favored pursed his lips.
Should
he tell him? It could compromise his
sources and methods. Actually, it could
be more dangerous than that - acting
the way he was, Haddo might just
feel he had to tell somebody about it.
That wouldn’t do; especially not if this
other agent might end up taking care
of their problem with Maximillian for
them. “Look, I’ve got to go. You watch
out. If Dortonn’s around, who knows
who could be hanging around too.”
That feels like a good compromise,
thought Favored, watching Haddo scut-
tle away. It was generic enough not to
let on he had speciﬁc information but
had still come out sounding emphatic.
In truth, how much more speciﬁc could
he be? This other guy he’d heard about
was slipperiness on the hoof.
How
could you watch out for someone like

that?
Well, maybe he could ﬁnd out more.
Until then he’d just have to keep alert
for this Fradjikan himself.
“Goals diverging,
are?” grumbled
Haddo to himself as he scurried his
way out of Mathom Park.
The park would surely be full tonight,
and for the rest of the upcoming Knit-
ting festival as well.
The festival as
well as the park would mean ongoing
work for Favored, which in turn meant
that it would be hard to pin Favored
down long enough to ﬁgure out what
he really knew, much less what he was
really up to.
After that last enigmatic warning it
was obvious Favored did know some-
thing. Who knew how deep his connec-
tions went? Further than just what he
could ﬁnd out by talking to gods, that
was certain. Haddo had his suspicions.

Although Favored played his capabil-
ities close to the chest, things Haddo
had observed over the years could best
be explained by assuming that Favored
could eavesdrop on conversations the
gods held secretly among themselves.
Perhaps it was time to confront Fa-
vored with it. If he -
“Sassa kachanta,” spat Haddo, skid-
ding to a halt. What a mess. He had
followed the most direct route out of
the park and onto a main street wind-
ing south.
Things being what they
were at the moment in Peridol, one
more half-height ﬁgure in a black cloak
was thoroughly unremarkable, so why
not take a straight shot, why even
bother to lurk in the shadows?
Well,
trafﬁc was one reason, or in a larger
sense the myriad obstacles a big city
threw up to make life challenging to
everyone, in its thoroughly ecumenical

and equal-opportunity manner.
Such
a complication had indeed presented
itself here.
Among the modern innovations for
which Peridol was famous were its
plumbing,
its
waterworks,
and
its
desalination utility.
Applied sorcery
might have motivated the puriﬁcation
and pumping systems, but there was
nothing magical about getting water
out of an indoor tap. All the water had
to do was ﬂow. This it did through the
maze of water mains buried beneath
the streets. Except, of course, when the
water decided to ﬂow somewhere else,
or the water mains refused to remain
in their assigned places underground.
Which in a nutshell described the
scene Haddo had rounded a corner and
marched straight into.
A carriage-horse was rearing and
pawing the air. The carriage itself had

overturned on a milk cart. People were
alternately craning for a view or shov-
ing their path backward out of the way.
Rain was falling and wetting down ev-
erything in sight - no, not rain at all,
but a geyser erupting from the middle
of the avenue, the tall column being
torn to shreds at its top by the breeze.
Somewhere up ahead, Haddo caught a
glimpse of a work crew struggling to
set up orange barricades.
Obviously another route was indi-
cated. Haddo turned to go ... turned ...
why weren’t his feet moving?
Like everyone else in the area, he
was standing in a puddle.
Up ahead
there was a veritable lake, but back
here the pavement was merely awash.
From the looks of it, one of the street-
cleaning
detachments
had
passed
through not long before the problem
had broken out.
That was fortunate;

if the street had still been ﬁlled with
the usual mix of mud, refuse, and of-
fal, the water would have churned the
area into a sewer. Perhaps Haddo had
caught his foot on some sticky residue
the sweeping crew had missed?
But
then why would his feet be cold?
Cold?
Ice. Haddo’s spot of the puddle had
frozen solid as he stood there, trapping
his feet in the frost.
Could this be a
strange freak of nature, a spurious mi-
croclimate?
Of course not.
“Yourself show,”
Haddo called out. “Know I that there
are you.”
Behind him he heard a chuckle. “A
guilty conscience is it then, O Fist?”
“Of elimination the process,” Haddo
muttered, feeling a frigid breeze move
across his back. Damned if he’d give
him the satisfaction of twisting around

- with his feet still trapped - to look him
in the eye. It felt like a sending anyway.
“South do not usually come you.”
“If it were merely to visit you, my
wandering Fist, I most likely would not
have made the effort, much though I re-
gretted the circumstances of our part-
ing.”
“Bet I just did you,” said Haddo un-
der his breath.
“You are as feisty and even-tempered
as ever, I see. The tendency of time to
mellow has scarcely -”
“To the point come. Chilly are feet.”
“You always were too much the seri-
ous one, weren’t you. Very well. The
point is this. In return for his favor, my
lord Pod Dall has bound me to certain
obligations. I now extend these obliga-
tions to you.”
“Reject I your obligations. Finished
are we.”

“Oh, no, we are scarcely ﬁnished,
are we, Fist? Loyal Fist? Straightfor-
ward Fist? Fist who, if he was going
to league himself with his master’s
enemies, was unwise enough not to
complete the job, and was further un-
wise to leave behind certain friends
and relations? No, we are scarcely ﬁn-
ished. But ﬁrst things ﬁrst. And who
knows, but that ﬁrst things handled
well may not moderate a stern decree
otherwise to follow?”
He always had liked to hear himself
talk too much, thought Haddo. Haddo
wasn’t quite fool enough to say that,
though. “State you your task,” he said.
“The situation is simple. I have come
south seeking the ring that imprisons
my own master. A ring that is within
your reach.
You will obtain the ring
and give it to me.”
“I -”

“Please don’t try to tell me your prin-
ciples won’t allow you to betray your
employer.
We both know that too is
scarcely the case, don’t we?”
“...
Difﬁcult would it be,” Haddo
protested.
“Guarded is ring, trapped
and by wards protected.
If careful
were I not, to Pod Dall greater hazard
caused would be.”
A touch of ice patted Haddo com-
panionably on the shoulder. “Then re-
venge would be my obligation, rather
than rescue and release. I know you
will take all necessary care. Still, I am
reasonable, and there is the good of my
lord at stake. I give you three days.” A
swirl of cold wind tore at Haddo’s back,
followed by a schlurp-POP.
So much for the sending, and now
the ice at his feet was turning the
barest bit mushy to boot.
Making
nasty sounds under his breath, Haddo

grabbed his leg with both hands and
pulled, kicked, squirmed ... ice creaked
and crackled, and ﬁnally his foot began
to move, hung up, and then slipped
smoothly free. He got to work on the
other one.
Damn Dortonn.
Damn Favored,
damn Max, damn Karlini, damn the
whole damned bunch of them. He was
really in a corner.
It only made it
worse to realize how obvious it was in
retrospect.
He should have expected
a direct approach from Dortonn. But
he’d already pointed Svin at Dortonn,
too.
Svin was no dummy, either; it
wouldn’t be easy to swerve him from
his course now, and he clearly wouldn’t
settle for being sent on a wild-goose
chase.
Dortonn would expect some kind of
double-cross.
His taunt about failing
to ﬁnish the job was an obvious cue.

But would he expect Svin, or Favored?
Or Karlini? Damn. The situation held
nothing but hazard.
On the other hand, Dortonn hadn’t
been that bad a boss. Savage and bru-
tal to be sure, and all the other typical
elements of that sort of job description,
but he did get things done. They’d had
a decent working relationship.
Maybe it was time to consider again
another position of employment.

Chapter17
IT PROMISED TO BE A PLEAS-
ANT EVENING - weather-wise, at
least.
Socially, it might prove to be
quite another matter.
Leen adjusted
those useless shoulder-ﬂounces again,
ﬂuffed out the chiffon, and glanced out
the window a ﬁnal time as her hired
carriage rolled up the grand drive and
turned into the portico. Her invitation
had gotten her smoothly through the
barricade at the edge of the lawn where

the waiting crowds had craned for a
glimpse of the celebrity she might hap-
pen to be. She had thought of telling
them to visit her at the library, why
didn’t they, but in the event she had
maintained her decorum and let the
crowd rush past to the pair of Bones on
horseback who’d been coming up after
her.
From the outside, the pavilion cer-
tainly seemed to live up to its advance
billing, and to the word-of-mouth that
had accompanied it around town.
It
was traditional to inaugurate the ﬁrst
night of the Knitting season with the
Inauguration Ball, of course, and the
tradition included the dedication of
a new commemorative piece of archi-
tecture for the ball to be held in; the
tradition had been one of the few ex-
cesses of Abysinnia the Moot to have
survived the test of time. As excesses

went this one had actually done a rel-
atively signiﬁcant amount of good. A
number of the most useful public works
projects had been Inauguration lega-
cies, Carstairs’ Symphonic Hall, for ex-
ample, and even the Grand Vestibule
of her own Reading Room. Leen would
have liked to have been around for the
extravaganza held there, sure enough.
But this pavilion wasn’t bad.
The
great metal ribs, the interlacing super-
structure, the staggered levels and bal-
conies above the wide promenade ﬂoor,
and of course the broad sheets of glass
that covered the surface now all glit-
tering gold that shaded toward ruby in
the last moments of the setting sun. In-
side through the glass, lamps, lanterns,
trendy ﬂoating light-sculptures, and
roving spotlights were becoming vis-
ible, and over at the far end what
appeared to be the roaring ﬂame of an

open ﬁre. Alighting from the carriage,
the hubbub of voices broke in on her,
mingled with the merry sounds of a
seriously sprightly band. Leen handed
off her wrap to an attendant, accepted
a claim ticket in return, shook out the
chiffon once more, squared her shoul-
ders, and marched resolutely through
into the din.
Fortunately they’d proved to have
abandoned that other annoying cus-
tom, of formally announcing arrivals
complete with their tokens of renown
or notoriety. Especially under the cir-
cumstances, she would much rather
make herself apparent under her own
terms. Leen grabbed a wide-mouthed
glass of some bubbling liquid from the
nearest person in livery and set out to
ﬁnd a safe vantage-point from which to
observe the crowd. One of those upper
platforms, perhaps – that one, with all

the foliage -
“Not so fast” said a voice as an arm
hooked itself through hers.
But it
wasn’t the Scapula, or even a man. No,
it was her sister, Susannah, already
strategically placed, herself, for spot-
ting whomever came through the door.
Leen forced her pulse and her breath-
ing, which had both taken a quick
lurch, to begin quieting themselves.
“My dear, look at that dress,” Susan-
nah was saying.
“Look at you.
I’ve
been saying it for years but who could
have known it would be so true? - you
are quite a ravishing creature, quite
respectable indeed.”
As always, her sister was speaking
in a loud enough voice to easily ad-
dress her whole circle, and to cause
surrounding groups to stop and glance
over as well. “Really, Susannah, there’s
no point in making such a fuss over -”

“Au contraire, dear sister,” Susan-
nah said, this time in a low yet pointed
voice, and this time directly to her. “If
you think I’m going to let you sneak
off to hide in some corner you’d better
think again. I’ve been waiting for this
forever and I don’t intend to miss a
moment. Where is that beau of yours
anyway? Why isn’t he with you?”
“If you’re talking about the Scapula,
he’s not with me because I’m not with
him. I came on my own.”
“You - you what? But what about the
dress?”
“Murgatroyd
and
Walmark’s
bou-
tique on Best Street,” Leen said.
“Oh, my dear. What could you have
been thinking? That was scarcely wise,
scarcely wise at all.”
Actually, for a change Leen wasn’t
sure she didn’t agree with her sister.
What had gotten into her? Cussedness,

certainly, but it had been more than
that. Feeling sure the Scapula was up
to something and not knowing what
it was had made her uncomfortable, a
sensation that had only deepened as
the Scapula’s campaign to woo her had
intensiﬁed. He obviously saw her as a
challenge. Well, she could do the same
thing right back. She’d see how he be-
haved this evening. Even the Scapula
would have to be somewhat inhibited
by the massed presence of the entire
upper-crust of Peridol, along with the
city’s most inventive gate-crashers.
And he didn’t have to take her rejec-
tion of his dress as a declaration of war,
either. It was a statement of indepen-
dence, that’s all it was, a refusal to be
bought. At least by gifts of that magni-
tude. Knowing him, he might even be
amused at her spunk. Of course, know-
ing about him, it could equally well tip

the scales toward vendetta.
Unless whatever he needed her for
was more important than his feelings.
Or unless he needed her at a speciﬁc
time, which was running out...
Well, whatever would happen would
happen. Anyway, the ball didn’t have
to be a total loss even if he did decide
to be unpleasant. She was intelligent.
She could hold up a conversation. She
might even meet someone else.
Per-
haps, she thought sarcastically, I’ll run
across that ragman who caught my eye
on the street.
But whatever the evening held for
her, it hopefully didn’t involve hang-
ing around indeﬁnitely with her sister.
“Oh, look,” Leen said, “there’s Lemon,”
and taking advantage of the fact that
Susannah had turned to address an-
other dignitary she’d snared Leen used
the opening to slip away.

Once out of reach Leen decided to
make a swing past the food.
Lemon
had to be around somewhere, so she’d
spot him for real eventually. Who else
might be here that she actually might
want to see? She murmured greetings
to a few acquaintances as she passed,
and couldn’t escape being drawn mo-
mentarily into eddies of conversations
with people she recognized or who
claimed to recognize her.
She wasn’t
particularly trying to be aloof or dis-
tracted, really she wasn’t, but given
the circumstances it was just naturally
the result. It seemed to be working, too,
and she didn’t especially mind leaving
people more confused than satisﬁed by
their encounters with her.
The place was ﬁlling up rapidly, but
not with anyone she might have liked
to talk to. Who was on her list? There
was that detective-fellow she’d spoken

with in the library, but even if he’d
been honest about who he was and his
intent to help her, he surely wouldn’t
have discovered anything of use in the
few hours since they’d met, and cer-
tainly he wasn’t likely to show up here
tonight if he had.
Unless he’d found
out something that couldn’t wait.
Well, her list didn’t have to be realis-
tic.
But then there was her brother, ﬁ-
nally, off across the ﬂoor from her
and up two levels, on a balcony. She
started toward him, balancing a plate
of canapés and a chicken concoction
dusted with powdered sugar as she
plotted a route up the interconnecting
stairs and landings. Perhaps he’d man-
aged to uncover something about the
Scapula.
It took the better part of ﬁve min-
utes of squirming through the press

to reach Lemon’s position.
Or what
had been his position, damn him. He’d
circulated onward.
Leen deposited
her empty plate on a service table and
leaned on the balcony railing, scanning
the crowd below. If she -
Huh?
What was wrong with her?
She’d made eye contact with yet an-
other random stranger who was stand-
ing on the main ﬂoor making his own
survey of the occupants of the upper
landings. Maybe it was the fact that
that street-vagabond had crossed her
mind again that had made her recep-
tive. It couldn’t be the same man, of
course - this one was well-groomed and
fashionably dressed,
complete
with
cravat and shirt-rufﬂes and tailored
over-jacket, a ceremonial sword (as
with most of the men and some of the
women) slung at his side.
But the

slug of electricity that had shivered its
way down her back into the pit of her
stomach - that had been the same, all
right.
When she’d had a chance to blink
and recover her bearings he was gone.
Had she imagined the whole thing?
Could waiting for the Scapula’s reac-
tion be preying on her mind more than
she’d thought?
Perhaps it would be
better to sit down for a moment.
No, damn it. She’d never been weak-
kneed in her life, and damned if she
was going to start now.
Even if she
rarely used it, she was a member of
her class. This gave her a certain back-
ground, and certain skills. What better
time to deploy all the undertow of her
upbrining but now?
The best way to decide how much
was imagination might just be to ﬁnd
that guy.

“Where the hell is that Archivist any-
way?”
Max had worked a ﬁnger into his
tight collar and was hauling away at
it, trying to force the unyielding ma-
terial to stretch, no doubt. “Or is the
collar-button you hope to pop?” Shaa
asked.
“Stop being so goddamned urbane,”
Max told him.
Shaa’s face grew mournful. “I can’t
help it, especially in a place like this. I
was raised this way. It must be in my
blood.”
“That’s not the only thing in your
blood, and you’d better not forget it.”
“Oh, I wager the context won’t en-
tirely slip my mind.” Shaa eyed the
contents of a plate whose owner was
drifting by.
“What is that, do you
think? It rather looked like a sautéed
kumquat.
I can’t remember the last

time I’ve seen a kumquat this far north.
But that sauce - would the chef have
dared to use salsa?”
“With help like this,” Max muttered,
“I might as well have brought the kid.”
“Be patient, Maximillian.
We’ve
barely just walked through the door.
How do you intend to spot the Archivist
anyway? You didn’t bother to get a de-
scription.”
“Give me a minute with him and I’ll
pick him out.”
“You could save yourself some ef-
fort and ask someone,” Shaa suggested.
“But no, that wouldn’t be underhanded
enough, would it.”
Max favored Shaa with a momen-
tary scowl. “It’s the aura I’m after, you
know that; that’s what’s characteristic.
Okay, so I never made it over to the
Reading Room to reconnoiter. I’ve been
busy, you know that too, and anyway

the Archivist has to be around here
somewhere tonight.”
“Yet from your busy-ness, what have
you to show?”
“Precious little, damn it all.
Okay,
we might as well grab some food, any-
way. Come on.”
Max,
as he strolled through the
crowd, was the very picture of hair-
trigger alertness, his eyes tracking,
his stance taut, contained energy in
his sinews.
Compared to him, Shaa
thought, I portray the essence of lounge-
lizard languor. But then it was, as he’d
remarked, in the breeding. And it was
also true that Max was taking, as al-
ways, matters close to heart.
A good
part of Max’s activities since arriving
in Peridol had involved running down
experts and leads on Shaa’s own situa-
tion. Always has to do things his way,
wouldn’t take my word I’d already been

over it.
That was Max.
Although he ap-
peared to be growing, if anything, more
intense.
But perhaps that had something to
do with the other activities surround-
ing him. “You’re still having that prob-
lem with loose pieces of architecture in
your immediate vicinity?” Shaa asked
him, as they entered the line for a large
table festooned with vegetable appetiz-
ers and a steam table.
Max’s
head
snapped up
and
he
quickly scanned the arched roof. Noth-
ing was cascading toward him. “Don’t
-”
“It was only a question,” said Shaa,
“that obviously contained its own an-
swer. You suspect Ma Pitom?”
“Yeah. I do, but what I don’t under-
stand is why all of a sudden it’s old
home week. I know about the Hand for

sure, and now there’s this indication
of Ma Pitom, and the steerhorn I told
you about from the road makes you
think about Homar Kalifa, and there’s
been some other stuff too... Makes you
wonder if there’s some one force behind
it all.”
“I’ll take some of that, please,” Shaa
told the server, “and a few of those –
what are those? - battered cauliﬂower,
yes, ﬁne, and perhaps a slice of that
garlic concoction as well. Why bother
with speculation? You are who you are;
you might as well presume.”
“Thanks for the reassurance,” Max
said, ignoring the server and helping
himself.
“I was meaning to ask, why did you
decide to dispense with your cloaks and
camouﬂage?
Merely the obvious, or
some other nefarious purpose? That’s
quite enough, thank you, although ...

yes, I believe I will hazard one of those
kumquats. They are kumquats? How
remarkable.”
“Which obvious is that?” muttered
Max, adding a bow-tied sour roll to his
spoils.
“The fact that your disguises obvi-
ously haven’t been doing much good,
since Ma Pitom and the Hand and
whoever else haven’t been deterred by
them for a moment.”
“Yeah,” Max admitted, “that’s obvi-
ous, all right.” As they turned away
from the table, they could scarcely
miss the white-haired gentleman in
the purple of a high-level Nerve who
was goggling, jaw dropped, at Shaa.
“A pleasant evening,” Shaa greeted
him, “who could deny it? I recommend
the skewered salmon.”
If anything, the man’s mouth opened
wider. “Good lord, it is young Shaa!” he

said out loud.
Shaa squinted at him. “The senior
Hargreaves-Hedge, I hope I’m not mis-
taken?”
Hargreaves-Hedge grasped Shaa by
the shoulder. “But the curse, boy, what
about the curse?”
“Catch you later,” said Max. It was
time to get serious about the evening,
and Shaa would obviously be tied down
for the time being. Max made his way
to the edge of the main dance ﬂoor next
to the band, ﬁnished inhaling the con-
tents of his plate, and began to scan the
crowd.
Well, maybe he’d better ask someone
for directions to the Archivist, Max
considered after a few moments. There
were no shortage of recognizable faces;
he’d even spotted the woman he’d no-
ticed on the street, the one who’d been
staring at him as though she’d seen

something in his face that lit him up
like a beacon. In his brief glimpse just
now, the woman had seemed almost as
astonishingly transformed as he was,
himself.
On him the transmutation
was from unrecognizably,
well,
dis-
reputable, to something approaching
an all-around gentleman, if he didn’t
mind saying so himself. That was noth-
ing compared to the change in her. On
her it was from mundane to extraordi-
nary.
Although that wasn’t quite true. The
woman hadn’t been mundane.
There
had been something exceptional about
her that had leapt out at him even
in that brief instant in the midst of
trafﬁc.
If it wasn’t time for business
and things weren’t so much on edge,
he might try to ﬁnd her and ﬁgure out
what it was.
But as it was, he had to ﬁnd the

Archivist. It was fairly much night out-
side now, which meant he might not
have long before the entertainment.
What time were the ﬁreworks sup-
posed to start? Max looked at around
at the folks nearest to him. Which one
of them seemed the type who’d be able
to describe the Archivist? There was
something about the woman with the
excessive tiara... no, it was the tiara
itself, it was a node-point for some
wag’s Track. There were no shortage of
Tracks around tonight, spread around
as liberally as calling cards, but this
was not the time for them, either. Per-
haps one of the majors-domo?
“Good evening,” said a smooth con-
tralto at his elbow.
“Good -” Max said, but as he turned
his voice trailed off as a frog lodged un-
accountably in his throat.
It was that woman.

Well, he could always talk to her for
a moment and then ﬁnd the Archivist.
Except -
“Excuse me,” the woman was saying.
“Is this a bad time? I don’t think you’ve
been hearing a word since I came up.”
“Perfect time,” said Max.
“Perfect.
I’m sorry. I’ve had a lot on my mind,
and then you - I mean, you...”
She was looking at him now as
though
wondering
if
she’d
entered
the effective radius of some virulent
contagion.
“It must have been my
imagination,” the woman muttered,
half to herself.
“Only - could I have
seen you on the street? Looking like a
refugee from a rubbish-heap? Oh, par-
don me, I know this is horridly rude.
Of course it could scarcely have been
you - your face, what I could see of it,
was different, and ... But your aura ...”
Tell me about auras, Max thought.

To his surprise, though, he found him-
self saying, “This is what I really look
like. When I’m on good behavior and
there’s a point in spifﬁng up, that is.”
What had gotten into him? Why was
he telling her that?
Shaa would be
amazed.
Max was amazed.
Or was
appalled a better word?
Especially since he had come seek-
ing the Archivist, and had a rather
nasty bit of business in mind for the
Archivist once he’d been found.
Ex-
cept it was suddenly clear that the
Archivist wasn’t a he.
Tell me about auras, he thought
again.
But auras didn’t lie, at least
in other hands.
And he was in close
enough range to fully size up this one.
“Madame Archivist?”
The Archivist frowned. “Please call
me Leen, why don’t you.”

It was surprising how quickly this
stuff came back.
Or not so surpris-
ing, really; it was a characteristic of
really useless skills that they remain
indeﬁnitely intact long past the decay
of other, fully essential capabilities.
There was context to consider, too. His
background in social etiquette was get-
ting its current airing merely because
of his hovering miasma of impending
doom.
On the other hand, there were sce-
narios that were probably worse.
It
would be worthwhile to contemplate
them, as a counterweight to his cur-
rent train of thought, except he would
have to think of a few of them ﬁrst.
“Please excuse me,” Shaa told his
current companion.
“I believe those
pickled mahi curls are calling to me.”
“You just watch yourself, now, Zoll,”
the fellow said, his handlebar mus-

tache ﬂapping.
“Indeed,” said Shaa. “That’s just as
good advice for you, seeing as you’ve
been imprudent enough to be seen with
me, Chew.”
Chew Andrews, an old friend of his
mother’s and still one of Eden’s repre-
sentatives here in town, squinted at
him. “Why the hell not? Damn curse
isn’t catching, is it?”
“No,” Shaa said, “but my brother
very well might be.” Reﬂection re-
turned with a vengeance on his way
back to the refreshments. It really was
tempting fate for him to even be here,
but as Chew had said, what the hell.
He’d already met the Curse Adminis-
trator. What more could his brother do
to him, after subcontracting the curse
in the ﬁrst place, other than humiliate
him publicly? That would be no picnic,
but it was still not in the same league

at all as progressive eradication.
Of course, where restoratives were
concerned, the evening’s caterers were
more than adequately stocked.
His
plate liberally replenished, Shaa popped
one of the mahi-mahi twists into his
mouth and considered his next move.
It would be wise to check Max’s status;
who knew what kind of situation he
might have gotten himself into by now.
And there he was, too, half-concealed
behind a line of potted dwarf palms
and a statue of some Emperor past.
Talking. With a woman. One tended to
forget it because of his usual frenetic
level of activity, but Max was not par-
ticularly tall; the woman topped him
by at least an inch or so. The woman
had a no-nonsense air that comple-
mented Max’s own. In contrast to the
elaborate coiffures that predominated
among the other celebrants, of both

sexes, her short black hair artfully
streaked with gray had merely the
look of a natural curl to it. Her -
Then Shaa noticed that the two
of them weren’t merely talking, they
were strikingly engrossed.
That was unlike Max,
especially
while he was on a self-set mission, and
when was he not?
Max had made a
career out of avoiding potential new
entanglements and complaining about
the ones he already had, such as Shaa
himself, for example.
Max’s behavior
at the moment seemed scarcely typical.
Even better, it might be a hopeful sign.
Shaa drifted closer and lounged back
against the old stone Emperor’s chest.
Eventually Max would acknowledge
his presence or he’d force his own en-
try into the conversation, or on the
other hand perhaps he wouldn’t. Max
had noticed him, certainly he had, but

it was true that Max’s manners, not be-
ing ingrained in him from birth, some-
times showed a tendency to disappear
under pressure.
Where was the pressure here, how-
ever?
If Max was taking something se-
riously here that could be pressure
enough.
Leen was confused. What had come
over her?
Where were all the social
skills that had been pounded into her
reluctant mind throughout her child-
hood? What had happened to the guile
that was supposed to shield any true
feeling from public view, the defense of
reserve, the aloof unconcern?
Where, indeed?
But then why was she still feeling
these curls of electricity?
Why, al-
though she didn’t particularly like cats
or cat-based metaphors, did she feel

like nothing other than purring, of all
things? Nothing was tickling her belly
in any objective sense...
but it still
felt like it, anyway. She’d better ﬁnd
Lemon; he’d know.
On second thought, she’d better not
ﬁnd Lemon. For exactly the same rea-
son.
And why was she sure these feel-
ings weren’t just hers alone? For the
radiation of sheer competence and
force of personality, this Maximillian
was right up there with the Scapula,
clearly. Like the Scapula, he was most
likely abroad on some secret errand or
another, or why would he have been
out in the street in that disguise?
But at the moment Max looked as
woozy as she felt.
As though some-
thing had walloped him upside the
head, knocking his perceptions and
reactions completely out of whack.

These weren’t the most confusing
things of all. The most confusing thing
of all was that deranged though her
senses felt, she found she rather liked
it.
“Understatement of the year,” Leen
mumbled under her breath.
“Excuse me?” said Max. “Would you
like some more food? Would you like to
leave? Would you like to sit down?”
“No, no thank you. No.” She broke
her
gaze
away
again
and
quickly
scanned the room.
“Who are you looking for?”
“There’s someone probably here I
probably don’t want to see.”
“I shouldn’t have asked anyway,”
Max said, with some confusion.
“It’s
none of my business. I - I apologize.” A
throat cleared itself in a familiar way
behind him. “Oh, here’s somebody for
you to meet. Zalzyn Shaa, Doctor Shaa

actually but most everyone just calls
him Shaa; Leen. The Archivist.”
“Charmed,” said Shaa, bowing over
her hand. “Completely and absolutely.”
Shaa?
She knew that name, of
course, but not this particular person.
“Are you -”
But then her gaze, which had lit on
this Shaa only for a moment before
resuming its ongoing inspection, found
the object of its search.
“Oh, damn,”
Leen said. Max glanced over his shoul-
der and followed her stare.
He was not actually that far away,
only thirty feet or so, and he too had ap-
parently been looking for her. Or them.
The Scapula paused in the middle of
the sentence he was saying to the man
next to him, like himself garbed in the
dress costume of a Bone, and his eyes
grew wide. His smile became more of
a smirk, and then an open gleeful grin.

He inclined his head in greeting across
the intervening partiers, then broke
with his partner and embarked on a
leisurely but deliberate stroll toward
them.
“That’s who you probably don’t want
to meet?” Max sputtered. “Shaa -”
“I see him, Maximillian.
Unless I
miss a sucker-bet guess, he has just
spotted me, too.”
Leen looked between them. “Oh, you
know the Scapula?”
“Yes,”
Shaa
acknowledged,
“you
could say so.
After all, he is my
brother.”
“Your...?” Wait a minute - what
was that Lemon had said about the
Scapula having a family curse, that
she’d brushed off without thinking
twice about it, that she’d actually re-
membered something about herself?
There were curses and curses, but ...

wait a ... Holy - Leen almost muttered
something highly inappropriate to her
ofﬁce. This was that Shaa! This was
that curse, that was who this fellow
was - the one who could never set foot
in Peridol again. And he was here. Oh,
my lord -
And then Shaa was not the only
Shaa who was here; right here. “Arz-
naak,” Max said.
“What a nice surprise,” said the
Scapula.
“Not only Maximillian, but
Zal too. I heard you were in town and
hoped I’d have a chance to see you.”
“I’m sure you did,” Shaa said evenly.
“So you did come back, did you.”
“Yes, well, you know how it is.”
“Do I? Why don’t you tell me? In any
case, how are you? We should get to-
gether more often, being siblings that
is.”
“Oh,” said Shaa, “is that how siblings

are supposed to behave?
I wouldn’t
know.”
“Come now, dear brother, be affable.
You are on public display. And Arleen,
my dear - just having a pleasant little
conversation, I suppose?”
“As a matter of fact that’s right,” said
Leen, trying for evenness herself.
“I didn’t know you’d become an exem-
plar of the arts,” Shaa said suddenly to
his brother.
“Oh?” said Arznaak.
Something
sharp seemed to glint in his eyes, some-
thing scarcely affable at all. “Why do
you say I have?”
“This scene is a signal example of
surrealism as performance.
Wouldn’t
you say?”
“Actually I wouldn’t.
It seems per-
fectly straightforward to me. And just
because you can cloud the minds of
others, dear brother Zal, don’t think

you can do that to me.” Arznaak di-
rected his gaze at Leen. “Arleen and
I had been conversing just this after-
noon, if you recall, and the topic was
not ﬁnished, my brother’s attempt at
distraction or misdirection or whatever
you choose to call it notwithstanding.
No, not ﬁnished at all.”
“I rather think we were,” said Leen.
“I rather think not,” the Scapula told
her. “Do you stand with me or do you
stand with them?”
Leen stuck her jaw out.
“Neither
one. I’m just standing, that’s all. That’s
what people do at parties.” Normal peo-
ple, anyway, in whose company none
of those around here at the moment
could obviously be counted.
“An interesting attitude, if an un-
tenable one,” pronounced the Scapula.
“Now Maximillian, or shall I call you
Max?, what -”

“You can call me fed up,” said Max,
“that’s what you can call me. This has
all gone far enough. Once and for all,
will you drop this ridiculous vendetta
and cancel the curse?”
Arznaak looked amused.
“No, of
course not. What do you propose to do
about it?”
To Leen’s eye, Max was clearly ath-
letic. He didn’t project the overwhelm-
ing material power of bulging muscles
or the raw intimidation of an aggres-
sive stance, but the controlled glide
when he moved and the way he stood
balanced on the balls of his feet and
the sheer physical competence about
him said this was clearly a man who
knew how to manage more than his
mind and his tongue. He did know how
to manage them, that was plain, even if
they had seemed somewhat askew dur-
ing the time the two of them had been

talking together; no one would have
given her clarity of conversation high
marks from that period either. But had
she seen a hint that Max was capable
of the world-class skill that would let
him move between one eye-blink and
the next from a position of studied if
watchful rest to a full en garde, a sword
that was anything but ceremonial in
his right hand, with nothing but an af-
terimage of blurs and streaks to attest
to the transition that must have taken
place in the middle? She had not, yet
that was apparently just what had just
unfolded in front of her. And what was
unfolding still, as the en garde contin-
ued without pause into a full-force and
maximum-speed lunge directly toward
the Scapula’s chest.
The Scapula was in motion too, his
own hand snaking to the hilt of his
weapon and the weapon itself starting

to come free. He would never make it,
though, he would barely get his sword
halfway to position, he was about to be
-
But then all of a sudden Max’s right
foot, which had been planted in a step
while his other foot propelled him for-
ward, ﬂew out to the side, the rest
of his body began to turn a lateral
cartwheel, and he hit the ﬂoor hard
with his right shoulder and the whole
edge of his head. His sword clattered
to the ﬂoor next to him.
“No,” said Zalzyn Shaa, breathing
hard. But that was to be expected from
someone whose own abrupt display of
unexpected dexterity had thrown Max
to the ground in the ﬁrst place, with
a carefully timed kick against Max’s
vulnerable ankle.
Max glared up at him from the ﬂoor.
“You idiot!” he snarled. “I would have

had him - this time I would have had
him, and we could’ve all been done
with this garbage once and for all. Get
your foot off that sword.”
“No,” Shaa said again.
“Come now, Max,” said the Scapula.
“You couldn’t even hold a sword at the
moment. Look at your right arm - it’s
numb.” The Scapula’s own sword, how-
ever, was still in his hand. His sharp
smile was still in place, with perhaps
a few additional barbs dangling from
the corners, and his attitude of mock-
ing nonchalance was fully active, but
he too was breathing with more than a
hint of a pant. “You may be right, you
know,” he went on, waving his blade in
Max’s direction, if from a great enough
distance to keep Max from catapulting
himself from the ﬂoor to snatch it from
his grasp. “You might have gotten me.
Fortunately my dear brother Zal has

my welfare at heart. Don’t you, dear
brother?”
“Obviously so,” said Shaa.
“You idiot,” Max was still muttering.
“You’ll never get him off your back with
a sharp tone and snide remarks. Why
should I do all this work for you when
you don’t give a damn?”
“Why indeed?
But the answer is
still no,” Shaa told him. “That’s ﬁnal.”
And his tone certainly sounded that
way. He looked around, at the hushed
crowd ringing them, its breath drawn
in a collective gasp, said “Excuse me”
to the person nearest him and to the
mass at large, pushed the fellow aside,
and swam away across the ﬂoor.
“And we were just starting to have
such fun, too,” stated the Scapula.
“You want fun?” said Max, getting
slowly to his feet.
“I’ll give you fun.”
Damn Shaa.
He’d even taken Max’s

weapon away with him.
Leen’s own head was spinning, but
one thing still seemed to be clear.
“You’re both going to have real trou-
ble in a minute if you don’t cut this
out.”
Above them, on the highest balcony,
a slender ﬁgure had emerged, bathed
in a wash of white light; a ﬁgure that
appeared to be staring directly down
at them.
Max wrapped up his scowl,
lowered his head, and dropped down on
one knee. Out of the corner of his eye,
the Scapula more slowly did the same
thing.
The wave of obeisance spread. The
Emperor-Designate’s direction of gaze,
however, never wavered.
Yet neither
did he beckon to the small entourage
at his back. Instead, he raised a hand,
outstretched toward the roof. “Let the
festivities begin,” he called in a strong,

projective tenor.
A rapid series of crumps sounded
from outside. Trails of sparks streaked
into the sky.
Overhead at the roof’s
long apex, with a large mechanical
groan, a line of sky appeared, unﬁl-
tered by the tint of the glass panes.
The line widened to a bar and kept
increasing; the two sections of the roof
were folding back. Then, in a massive
coordinated barrage clearly visible be-
yond, the ﬁrst six skyrockets went off
together.
To Leen, however, the more signif-
icant pyrotechnics were those taking
place in her immediate vicinity.
The
Scapula, his gaze turned up past smol-
dering to incandescent, had moved in
on her as the lamps and ﬁres inside
the pavilion went down and the show
in the sky kicked off, putting her and
Max and him shoulder-to-shoulder in a

potentially more than metaphorical tri-
angle. The way the Scapula - Arznaak
Shaa - ﬂipped his personal magnetism
off and on was starting to annoy her
more than a bit, though. Knowing it
was just as much a tool to him as his
sword or his henchmen made it easier
to resist.
Whatever it was about Max, on the
other hand, clearly wasn’t indiscrim-
inate, and she didn’t think it was
planned, either.
It was new and dif-
ferent, but she wasn’t necessarily look-
ing for new and different.
From the
context of things, too, whatever Max
might have to offer was situated in the
middle of a plain of booby-traps and
broken glass. “This all has nothing to
do with us,” the Scapula murmured
to her beneath the explosions of the
air-shells.
“What does it have to do with, then?”

The Scapula shrugged.
“Families
are unaccountable, hm?”
Max was watching from the side,
his arms folded.
His stance seemed
calm, though, or as calm as she’d seen
him earlier, anyway, rather than dis-
playing the full force of the frustration
he undoubtedly still felt; only his eyes
showed that. In contrast to the circle of
onlookers still hanging around in case
of any new outbreak, Max was close
enough to hear the words between
them, and the Scapula plainly didn’t
care if he did or not. “Are they?” Leen
said. “I’d say sometimes an accounting
is exactly what’s needed. Hm?”
“No matter,” he told her. “Come with
me now, Arleen. Nothing else is impor-
tant.” The force of his gaze was intense,
but its meaning was inscrutable.
He
made her uneasy.
He’d always made
her uneasy, but it had taken meet-

ing Max to really make her realize
that. There were similarities, true, but
when you got right down to it there
was truly no comparison between the
feelings she got from the two of them.
Of course, at the moment the Scapula
was trying to make her feel uneasy.
“No,” said Leen, “I don’t think so. Not
now.”
“If you decide to come with me later
the terms will not be the same.”
“That’s just a risk I’ll have to take.”
Arznaak shifted, and for a moment
she thought he was about to lean in to
kiss her or to perhaps make a grab, and
maybe he had had that in mind, too,
but then out of the corner of her eye she
saw Max adjust his stance as well, not
blatantly or with any explicit move to-
ward her on his part, and the Scapula
paused. He looked deliberately at Max,
then at Leen, and then turned abruptly

away with a swish of his jacket. The
crowd around them exhaled as if in uni-
son and began to break up.
“I’ve got things to do that won’t
wait,” Max said. “I’m not like Arznaak,
but - hell.” The expression in his face
seemed to be going in about half-a-
dozen directions at once, which only
made it an accurate mirror of the way
she felt. “I - damn.” He shook his head.
“When can I meet you again? I don’t
mean to muscle you like him, but -” He
swallowed some comment she thought
it was just as well she hadn’t heard.
Then, with a note of what sounded
strangely like despair in his voice, he
said, “I need to see you again.”
“I’m at the Archives most days,”
Leen said.
“Right,” he muttered.
“I - right.”
With a strange imitation of someone
tearing themselves loose from a piece

of ﬂypaper, he twisted and moved away.
His head jerked once to the side, as
though he was catching himself be-
fore he’d actually turned back around
to face her, but then he put his head
down and disappeared behind a clump
of people craning upward at the aerial
pageant.
What is wrong with me?
Leen
thought.
Why, her pulse was racing
and she was more short of breath than
on her periodic jogs around the park.
She was even shivering, although the
banked ﬁres and space heaters kept
the chill of the evening air from pene-
trating the assembly on the ﬂoor. And
-
Someone clasped her around the
shoulders. She broke the grip, wheeled,
and was about to pummel whatever
she found there with her bare hands
when she recognized her own brother,

Lemon.
“You’re an idiot -” she sput-
tered, “don’t you know I’ve had attack
training - I could have -”
“It is time,” Lemon told her, “to sit
down.”
Damn, Max thought. This changed
everything. But he didn’t want every-
thing to change. A life of discipline and
artiﬁce, of practice in masking your
feelings because you knew damn well
they cause nothing but trouble, and
then when it really matters, when the
situation comes that all that training
was geared toward, out the window,
that’s where it goes. He’d better pull
himself together and get back to the
job or he’d be out to lunch, and it might
be a lunch he’d be the guest-of-honor
entree at too.
And these other matters had to come
ﬁrst; he had to settle things one way or
another, once and for all. The backup

plan was now essential. Whoever the
Archivist was was beside the point.
Whatever his own feelings were or
might be was immaterial. A plan is a
plan.
And this wasn’t just any plan,
either. It was now the plan that had to
be run.
If he’d only thought to pick the mate-
rial up the last time he’d been in the
Archives, he wouldn’t have this prob-
lem now. But how much could he carry?
He hadn’t had a cart, and things being
what they were he hadn’t had an assis-
tant either. He also hadn’t had an op-
portunity to go back, or (to be honest) a
real reason. How could he have known
he’d ever need it?
But all these after-the-fact squirm-
ings were just futility and empty wind.
He needed to concentrate, to focus -
he’d never pick up a trainer course,
let alone a high-order Track, with a

mind cluttered and whirling as his. He
did the breathing control, the progres-
sive relaxation wave starting at his
toes and working up, and even though
he usually detested chants he did the
core visualization mantra too. The ex-
ternal noises of crowd and ﬁreworks
and his internal jumble both gradually
receded; slowly the traces of Tracks
began to tune in. Not that one, no, or
that other one across the room with its
node in the wineglass left in the hand
of another stone Emperor, or -
Wait.
The gods operated on magic’s sec-
ond quantum level; naturally a full-
scale God-Track would have a second
quantum component to it. The Tracks
Phlinn Arol had sometimes used to
bring Max to him were the kind an
unaugmented human could follow, but
then so far Max thought he’d managed

to keep Phlinn from the knowledge
of how far into the technical arcana
of the gods he’d actually been able to
penetrate.
Max spoke the right trig-
ger words and adjusted the calibration
with a small sweep-and-wriggle of his
ﬁngers.
A pink haze spun across his
vision; his hearing shifted tone values,
and then clear as day beside him was
the buzz of normal conversation.
The conversation of the people around
him was muted and thin, however.
Max edged to his left until the seem-
ingly normal sounds were most dis-
tinct, then strolled ahead. There were
no bodies attached to the conversation,
not yet anyway, and no intelligible
meaning, but the Track characteristics
were present nevertheless.
There it went, now, up into the ter-
races.
In the multicolored phospho-
rus glare of the skyrockets and the

twirlers and ﬁxed jets on the lawn
around the pavilion and even now
spouting from the lake, a pale pink
hood across his face shouldn’t be worth
a glance.
Waltzing into the midst of
the gods with while toting such a con-
struct was another matter, even if they
had been heavily partying.
For that
matter, meeting the gods with himself
on wasn’t exactly the smartest way to
go either.
This new nonsense was affecting
him more than was healthy. At least
he hadn’t out-and-out screwed up. He
had made certain preparations which
were still relevant, too.
A different
trigger-phrase launched the false aura
he’d whipped up earlier in the day, and
a few moments’ work behind a portable
azalea with his paint-and-putty kit
took care of his face.
The stairway to the ﬁnal terrace

proved to be hidden by a wall.
At
least, to mundane perception it was
a wall; on the second quantum level,
however, it was nothing but a screen of
mist. Max squared his shoulders and
ambled through.
With luck this wouldn’t take long.
Even with all the precautions the gam-
bit was a signiﬁcant risk; the quicker
he could be out the better. On the other
hand, Max did have the amulet from
the Archives, and anyway he didn’t
know a better way to quickly contact
the one he was after, if he happened to
be at the ball in the ﬁrst place. That
seemed a reasonable bet since Max
knew he was in town and had a re-
cent description to boot.
Otherwise
Max would have to wait in line at the
temple.
But he was in luck. Not ﬁfteen feet
from the top of the short stair behind

the mist-wall, standing by himself and
staring pensively up at rolling green
ﬁreballs, was the one he’d come to
see. Max had a window of opportunity;
he wouldn’t even use the note-in-the-
guy’s-pocket ruse. Max sidled up next
to him. “I think we have business to do
together,” he murmured.
The other lowered his face from the
sky and looked Max up and down as
though he were a person-sized insect.
“And why is that?
Who are you, and
what do I have that you want?”
Max ignored the sneer; this was busi-
ness. “It’s what I have that you want
that’s more to the point.”
It had been well-done, Fradjikan
thought.
A little histrionic, perhaps,
but then that was what the situa-
tion had required. His associate, the
Scapula, had even handled the unex-
pected collapse of his plot involving

the Archivist into that of Max with
reasonable aplomb. Now the next step
could proceed.
Tomorrow, when the
next wave of posters would show Max
challenging (if allegorically) the au-
thority of the new Emperor himself...
But ﬁrst, there was another pawn to
pursue. That promised no end to fun.
Then again, there was this Spilkas
fellow. They were keeping the refresh-
ment tables open while the show of
illuminations went on, so Fradi helped
himself to another slice of braised
lamb; the chefs had done a superb
job with that cabernet sauce and it
was important to show one’s apprecia-
tion. Fradi was also willing to admit
it might be appropriate to revise his
original impression of Spilkas. It was
starting to appear that Spilkas might
indeed be a potent adversary - or a
potentially powerful ally - who had

insinuated himself into Max’s camp
for his own reasons. He was clearly a
force to be tiptoed warily around. How
had Spilkas learned Fradi’s identity?
From the Scapula?
Doubtful in the
extreme. One of the players Fradi had
set loose against Max? But they didn’t
know. That left a limited range of pos-
sibilities, all of them sufﬁcient to give
a sane man pause.
According to his sources, Max’s po-
tential as a destabilizing factor was a
growing worry to certain of the gods,
and no longer only Fradi’s patron, ei-
ther.
Perhaps Spilkas was really an-
other operative on the same mission as
Fradi himself. Given that Fradi’s long-
term self interest was not necessarily
the same as the mission he had been
assigned, perhaps there was a basis for
collaboration.
The Scapula had implied he would

be generous with his own assistance
to Fradi in the future. Hopefully the
Scapula’s promise would in fact be re-
deemed.
In any case, though, it was
essential to have backup plans.
For that matter, Fradi could also
reinterpret his instructions. Might he
be bold enough to try shopping his ser-
vices around to other, competing gods,
too, if such there really were? Spilkas
might know. Spilkas might be able to
help. Spilkas might -
But anyway, there was that other,
more immediate pawn, and the other
step that could now proceed.
First
things ﬁrst.
It was just another party. Nothing
ever really happens at a party, so I was
sure I wasn’t missing anything.
On
the other hand, I’d gotten here just
in time to see Shaa and Max go in,
and a bit later Shaa’s brother Arznaak,

the Scapula, making his own grand
entrance. I was back with the rabble
behind a police line; comes from not
planning ahead and getting an invi-
tation.
Well, I’d never been fond of
parties anyway, and in any case I had
enough thinking going on to hold my
own party in my own head.
My life had gone through some
strange gyrations lately.
I couldn’t
remember the last time I’d climbed in
a window or threatened someone with
a sword or gotten hit over the head,
and as for shaking down clues and get-
ting paid for it, well, I might as well
have done that in another incarnation
for all the familiarity it had for me
now.
Most of my activities had come
to consist of wandering around and
talking to folks who came up to me on
the street. There had been that set-up
with the fountain and the statue, but

that one scarcely counted in my favor.
How many grown men outside of a lu-
natic retreat spend their time ﬁghting
stone monuments?
But the talking hadn’t exactly been
idle chatter either.
This latest salvo
from the Protector of Nature was the
screwiest yet. What kind of sap did she
and her cronies think I was, anyway?
Suppose I did take care of Max, not
what you’d call a cakewalk itself. The
Protector couldn’t know that by strik-
ing against Max I’d set myself against
the only group that was anything ap-
proaching friendly to me. In exchange,
though,
the Protector’s gang would
make me leader of the gods, she’d said,
which meant I’d be the front man for
their cabal until they’d swept the oppo-
sition out of the way, and then they’d
stab me in the back, or I’d outsmart
them by doing my own double-cross

ﬁrst, or -
I didn’t want to think about it.
Why was I bothering to spend time
on it, anyway? The Protector thought
I was a god, probably Gashanatantra,
but as far as I knew I wasn’t anything
of the sort, or if I was, it sure hadn’t
done me much good so far. I’d better
remember that before I decided to take
her up on her offer.
That
wasn’t
the
only
possibility,
though.
If she’d gotten wind of the
fact that there was something strange
about me, the Protector could have
been using her story as a cover to check
me out at closer range. Maybe she was
trying to ﬁgure out who I was, too. Or
perhaps the real center of interest was
Max. Could she be more interested in
ﬁnding out the full scope of Max’s own
contacts with the gods, with the goal
of employing that information against

the gods in question?
I may not have wanted to think
about this all, but I seemed to be get-
ting as far with that desire as with any
of my others.
Even with all my mental activity,
I tried not to lose track of the com-
ings and goings in the crystal ballroom
across the lawn. With Arznaak, Shaa,
and Max, and probably Fradjikan lurk-
ing around too for all I knew, I’d have
my choice of targets.
Well, I’d follow
whichever one of them showed ﬁrst.
Actually, the ﬁrst signiﬁcant change
in the situation was when the ﬁre-
works let loose. As the big top roof of
the pavilion started to crank open, a
bunch of long trailers of ﬁre jumped
off the ground from the fenced-off area
around it. The folks around me started
in to “ooh”ing and “aah”ing feverishly.
After the ﬁrst barrage, a raft out on

the pond let loose with its own display
of animated sparklers, here the old
Emperor’s proﬁle nodding sagely in
ﬁre, there the face of the new Emperor
receiving the symbolic accolade with
sober acknowledgement.
A wizard-
light display of bones and other con-
stituent parts of the Corpus Politick
began to rise from the far ground. That
was when I noticed that someone had
approached me from the crowd and
was standing in front of me, eyeing
me with a familiar glare. He seemed
a few inches taller than the last time
we’d met, just before my departure
from Oolsmouth. He could have been
wearing special shoes but somehow
that didn’t seem quite his style.
His
face had also ﬂowed a bit, enough for
him to no longer be the spitting dou-
ble of Jardin, although he still had
something like a second cousin’s rela-

tionship, or perhaps a stepbrother once
removed. His hand was out for me to
shake.
I braced myself and gritted my teeth.
The last time we’d clapsed hands, when
Jardin had taken him into our little
band of conspirators, thinking him to
be Soaf Pasook, I’d received a shock
about on a level with what I’d ex-
pect if someone with a large mallet
was suddenly using it to pound a not-
particularly-sharp stake through my
palm.
Nevertheless, it wouldn’t do
to just stick my hand in my pocket
and refuse to be baited. If I’d learned
anything from my dealings with him,
Gashanatantra was not a god to be
toyed with. So I bit down on my molars
and slapped my palm against his.
He didn’t seem surprised, but I sure
was. What I felt was ... a hand, and
nothing else. No bolts of lightning, no

surreptitious attacks, no sucking at my
life force, just ... a hand. “How you do-
ing?” I said.
“Well,” he informed me. “And your-
self?”
“Sure a nice night for ﬁreworks.”
Maybe I was just getting used to my
contacts with him, because there were
some other odd things about the way
this encounter was shaping up.
For
one, I was not feeling the vague ghost
of Gash’s own sensations. Maybe that
was a side effect of the metabolic link
that you built up a tolerance to.
I’d
been fairly much distracted at that
last meeting in Oolsmouth, but as I
thought back on it now I didn’t re-
call feeling his perceptions then either.
I had no idea what if anything that
meant. Maybe now I could punch Gash
in the stomach without laying myself
out, too, but it scarcely seemed worth-

while to try.
Throwing a ﬁst at him
that other time had probably been
valuable once, if only to learn that I
really did pack a pretty hefty right,
but that was the kind of lesson that
seemed worth learning the ﬁrst time
and never having to take again.
But all that was subsidiary. Our re-
lationship was clearly not founded on
small talk, so what did he want from
me this time?
“You are an interesting young man,”
he observed.
“Plenty of people like ﬁreworks,” I
said, not because it was a particularly
witty comeback but merely to feed him
something to move him on to his real
gambit. I had an idea of what his ﬁrst
deﬁnite move might be.
“May
I
commune
with
Monoch,
please?”
I hesitated. I’d been right, he wanted

Monoch in his hand so Monoch could
give his spy report on my activities.
But if something had shifted in the
metabolic link, perhaps something had
shifted as well in the balance between
us. “Actually, no, not at the moment,”
I told him, and held my breath as I
waited for his retribution.
Gash stared at me, but as I stared
back it became apparent that my blood
was not in fact boiling or the skin melt-
ing from my face. I’d won this bet, at
least.
But then he’d said “please.” He’d
never done that before, either.
Monoch, in his walking stick form,
was vibrating in my hand; he wanted
to talk to Gash, too. You heard me, now
shut up!
I thought at him.
Monoch
gave a last limp quiver and subsided.
“It is unimportant,” Gash stated.
“There are other matters for us to dis-

cuss.”
“Yeah,” I said, “you right. There’s a
lot of strange stuff going on, and folks
thinking I’m you has landed me right
in the middle of it. I’m getting a little
tired of you setting me up all the time
to draw your ﬁre.”
“Have you ever had an angry ex-wife
after you? No, I’m sure you haven’t.”
That’s what he said, but all of a sudden
I realized he’d told me something else
entirely.
When I’d made that last re-
mark I’d been thinking of my interview
with the Protector of Nature. As far as
Gash was concerned that had seemed
to me to be the biggest plot element
on the table at the moment. I ﬁgured
Gash would know about that gambit;
he’d have to. But he didn’t. I’d bet he
didn’t.
What was still on his mind was
my experience with his wife Jill and

the stuff he’d been stage-managing in
Oolsmouth.
“Sure I have,” I told him, shifting my
bearings.
“I’ve had yours.
I’ve man-
aged to avoid her since I got out of
Oolsmouth but that can’t last forever.
I’m not gonna let her eradicate me,
either, so don’t think you can get off
the hook with her that way. She might
even be warming up to you again.”
“To you, do you mean?”
“Don’t start that. I don’t want her,
and I don’t know whether you do or
don’t yourself.
So do us both a favor.
Decide what you want to do about her,
and then do it.”
“It’s not that simple.”
“Nothing’s that simple. But maybe
it could be. Or maybe you could treat
it that way anyway and make some
progress before complicating things up
again. You guys with the complex plots

- if you don’t watch out you’re gonna
trip over your own tangles.”
“There may be some truth to that,”
Gash admitted.
He seemed to be in an uncharac-
teristically mellow mood, not that I’d
ever had the slightest hint before that
Gash and that adjective might ever
ﬁnd themselves mentioned in the same
sentence.
Was it an opening?
“Look,
I’ve got some information for you I’m
willing to trade.”
“Trade?”
“That’s right, trade.
Here’s what
I’ve got. I was approached this after-
noon by someone who wants my help
in straightening out the political mess
you guys have gotten yourselves into.
In return they were gonna make me
Dictator of the Gods. For some reason
I thought they might not really have
had me in mind.”

I’d captured his interest, all right.
It looked like I was telling him news
he hadn’t already heard.
“That may
be,” said Gash.
“Who was this who
contacted you?”
“I’m not sure,” I told him.
“I don’t
know all of you the way you all know
each other. It seemed to be a woman,
but we all know how much that means.”
“What was your response? Did you
turn her down?”
“I never turn anybody down. I seem
to be living longer that way.”
“You are no fool,” he observed. “But
then that is self-evident, or I would not
continue to treat with you. Very well,
what do you propose in trade, for this
information and for the next contact?”
“With this metabolic link thing and
all, I’m sure you know I have a certain
problem.”
Gash hesitated.
“The Curse of

Namelessness.”
“Yeah, that’s right.” Gash had more
than paused, he’d seemed as off-balance
as I’d ever seen him. That was saying
a lot, since I’d never seen him anything
close to fazed before either. “How much
do you know about it?”
A particularly loud and ﬂashy bar-
rage of star-shells lit up over the lake,
and Gash turned to observe them. He
waited for the echoes to die out before
informing me, “I don’t know who you
are, if that’s what you’re asking, and
I assume it is. When one encounters
a victim of that Curse, however, the
wisest course of action is to investigate
further to make certain they are not a
trap.”
“A trap?”
Gash looked at me with a clinical
gaze.
“Certain nefarious individuals
have been known to use deep-level

programming beneath the Curse of
Namelessness to create a weapon. I do
not now believe that is the case with
you. You may be the damaged byprod-
uct of some earlier magical conﬂict,
that is a possibility.
Plainly, though,
the most likely case is still the most
straightforward one.”
These were intriguing ideas.
They
gave me new things to think about,
as though I really needed that, but
one of the new things was centered in
what he didn’t say. I had the feeling
there was a concept he’d left off his list.
“Okay, but -”
“For now that is all,” he stated.
“Have Monoch contact me when you
have your next meeting.” He swirled
his cape around and seemed to melt
back into the crowd.
I looked back over at the ﬁreworks.
I had to admit this was getting inter-

esting.
I wasn’t thinking only of the
way I was even starting to get used
to the abrupt entrances and exits the
folks I was dealing with always liked to
make; that was merely window dress-
ing. On the other hand, this talk with
Gash was strikingly reminiscent of my
interview with Phlinn Arol.
The key
similarity was the strong feeling they’d
each left me with that both of them
were lying.
Perhaps they didn’t out-
and-out know who I was, but they had
some pretty strong suspicions.
How far back might that really go?
Had Gash sought me out in Roosing
Oolvaya because of who he thought I’d
been? That was probably going a bit
far. There was no reason to assume our
ﬁrst encounter had been anything but
happenstance. Once he’d roped me into
his plot involving the Pod Dall ring and
the necromancer Oskin Yahlei, though,

and pinned me with the metabolic link,
he’d have realized I presented my own
mystery too.
The way I understood it, Gash had
been teamed with Soaf Pasook on the
play that put Pod Dall into the ring.
I thought Gash was nominally on the
Conservationist side, but his real inter-
est was in improving his position and
playing off one side against the other
for his own beneﬁt; this was the reason
he’d put Pod Dall in play in the ﬁrst
place. Maybe he didn’t anticipate the
other things he’d stir up, though.
If I was willing to run the risk of
possibly elevating my own importance,
it wasn’t outside the bounds of credi-
bility to speculate that Gash had set
his plans for Oolsmouth with me in
mind, and not just as a tool, either.
In the way he’d hung back behind the
curtains he’d been able to monitor the

situation, and to monitor me. He’d also
been seeing if he could get things to cut
loose or to clarify a bit by arranging for
extra pressure to be applied.
So just who the hell was I?
More to the point, I was getting a
very uncomfortable feeling. All these
major heavy-hitters wouldn’t be inter-
ested in me if I wasn’t at least poten-
tially part of their league, either as
pawn or player myself.
But I didn’t
like their league, and I wasn’t too fond
of them either.
What if I was one of them anyway?
In the red glare of the ﬂame pillars
and the drifting green of the latest
overhead burster, I noticed a familiar
ﬁgure stalking down the drive from
the pavilion, hands in his pockets and
head thrust forward aggressively.
I
angled to intercept him and caught up
just as he pushed past the guards at

the roadblock and headed off down the
street. “Hey,” I said.
Shaa glanced at me, looking clearly
the worse for some kind of wear. I of-
fered him my handkerchief; he took it
and mopped his brow. “I don’t want to
talk about it,” he told me.
“To hell with plots,” I agreed. “How
about getting drunk?”
“That,” said Shaa, “is the best idea
I’ve heard in a week.”

Chapter18
“NOW, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT,”
said Tildy Mont.
“I don’t know,” said Jurtan. “I don’t
know if this is such a good idea.”
“What would you know about it?”
“I was just out on the road with Max,
remember. I -”
“Don’t take that tone with me. And
what would being on the road have
taught you that’s of any use to any-
body anyway?”

Jurtan probably had been speaking
a little too haughtily for his own good,
he thought. He wasn’t about to admit
it, though, and on top of that there was
clearly no point in making the effort
when he had his sister around to do it
for him. “It sure made me learn how
to watch out for myself in a place like
this.”
“Great, so then do that. Watch out
for yourself.”
Not that this place bore any more
than a generic resemblance to those
Jurtan had encountered on the road,
either.
This didn’t seem to be a bar,
per se, and it sure wasn’t an inn; it
was more of ... of... a nightclub? That
ﬂashy cursive-scroll lettering spelling
the name of the establishment across
its front wall in ﬁery green wizard-
scrawl, for one example, and the dap-
per doorman, for another, and even the

carefully arranged shrubs and small
trees decorating the entrance bespoke
a facility with aspirations, at least.
“What are you looking for here any-
way?” Jurtan said, putting a hand on
his sister’s shoulder to hold her back
from her obstinate charge through the
door. “You’ve changed a lot. What hap-
pened? What happened on that boat?
Were you getting, uh, friendly with the
sailors? What about Shaa? Were you -”
There
was
a
difference
between
learning something in the more-or-less
abstract of a place like the road, Jurtan
was discovering, and being able to put
the lesson into practice automatically
in whatever other situations it might
warrant, which was to say at any time
and any place.
But then who would
expect that his own sister would haul
off without warning or provocation and
sock him in the stomach?

That was obviously the message, Ju-
rtan thought, bending over with both
arms folded over his belly, trying not to
throw up on the neat tiled walk. Tildy
had quite a punch on her. Well, who
needed her anyway, and good riddance
-
Not quite.
She was still standing
over him. When she was satisﬁed Jur-
tan had noticed her again, she told him,
“That’s none of your business. Why are
you asking me?
You trying to cover
up something on your own conscience?
Was Maximillian being friendly with
you?”
Jurtan again considered the option
of vomiting.
“Watch your mouth,” he
said weakly.
“Watch your own mouth. They’re all
too obsessed with their plots and their
plans anyway.”
I really should let well enough alone,

Jurtan thought vaguely.
“Oh, you
mean Shaa wasn’t interested in you?”
Tildy’s new shade of facial red was
quite striking.
Interestingly enough,
Jurtan had the feeling the ﬂush had
not come out of anger, or at least not
totally out of anger. This time she did
wheel, though, and stalked away from
him through the double-height doors.
Which just went to prove his point.
His sister did need someone to keep
on eye on her. Somebody who wasn’t
out to take advantage had to be con-
cerned for her well-being here in the
big city where she was so obviously out
of her depth. She might have rejected
him now but she’d certainly thank him
later. He creaked to his feet and wob-
bled in after her through the door.
Inside in the main room, Tildy had
spotted the Karlinis holding down a
small table off in a side booth.
She

wasn’t in a mood to tangle with them
again just yet. They hadn’t been going
at each other yet on the walk over, and
when it had appeared for a moment
that they might be getting ready to
start, the ﬁreworks had taken off over
on the other side of the city. The py-
rotechnical storm was no more than
a background rumble and boom from
their position, but its message was
clear; the Knitting had ofﬁcially begun.
A whistling yellow cloud had arched
down the street overhead, a small mob
of gowned ﬁgures stampeding after it
with wine bottles held high, music had
burst free from a building down the
block - in a word, utter pandemonium
had cut loose, all around them and
undoubtedly all across Peridol, as the
thousand-and-one
celebrations
that
had been awaiting the traditional sig-
nal to get themselves underway had

jumped on the good news.
In the midst of all that, for Roni and
Karlini to have launched into their
evening argument would have been
gratuitous as well as useless since you
could barely hear yourself think, much
less listen to someone standing next to
you.
Karlini had put an arm around
his wife’s waist.
She had merely ig-
nored it, until the arm seemed to give
up on its own and slide off.
But the Karlinis weren’t the only
role models around tonight. Standing
with her hands on her hips surveying
the main room from a position next
to the reception station was Dalya
Hazeel, iridescent in a slinky gown
that picked up the green of her eyes.
“Hi again,” Tildy greeted her.
“Hey,” said Dalya, not taking her
gaze off the crowd. “What kept you?”
“Nothing,” said Tildy, with a meaning

ﬁlled glare back up the entry hall at
her brother staggering in.
“Yeah, right, I know that kind of
nothing too. I got a candidate already
picked out for you - see that guy with
the black hair and the biceps over by
the edge of the stage?”
“Not bad, I guess.” Tildy hesitated.
“What am I going to do about Svin?”
“Leave him to me.” Dalya ﬂipped her
head, making her long black hair coil
out like a cloud. “Why do you think I
didn’t tell you who I spotted for me?”
“I don’t know about Svin. He’s sort
of a drag.”
“You just have to know how to treat
them, honey. Take the time Roni and
I...”
The Great Karlini gazed morosely
out across this waste-of-time joint and
toyed with his glass. What was Dalya
telling the Mont kid?
Dalya had al-

ways been a bad inﬂuence, and if -
“How’s your drink, dear?”
True, Karlini thought, it might be
prudent to give some attention to my
wife. “Oh, it’s ﬁne, I guess. I don’t know
where they’d be getting strawberries
this time of year so they’re probably
frozen, but the icemaker seems to be
working, anyway. What did Dalya told
you about this place? Seeing how she
seems to own it and all?”
“I don’t know that she owns it -”
Karlini gestured across the room.
“She greets people at the door, she
tells the waiters where to go and even
bosses the maitre-d’, she’s the only one
who goes in the little room behind the
bar in the corner - she’s sure not the
hat-check girl, you can bet on that.”
“As long as you ﬁnally seem to be
waking up and taking an interest in
the world,” Roni said, “and since we

can hear each other again over the din
from outside, I think it’s about time to
have a talk, dear.”
Waking up, thought Karlini. So that
was my mistake. “I always love to talk
with you, dear.”
“So I’ve seen. So you won’t mind talk-
ing about whatever’s been eating you.”
“What? What are you talking about?”
“You’ve never been very convinc-
ing when you try to lie, dear. What I
don’t understand is why you’re doing it.
What is it you don’t want to tell me?”
Karlini felt – not for the ﬁrst time in
the past weeks – as though he had been
blindsided by a runaway elephant, and
was even now subsiding into the large
circular footprint it had left behind it
in the mud. “Uh, well, it’s - it’s Haddo.
I’m thinking we may have to let him
go.”
“Haddo?
Whatever is the matter

with Haddo?
And why is that some-
thing you’re keeping from me?”
“You’ve been busy,” said Karlini, do-
ing his best to sound sincere. “I didn’t
think it was worth distracting you over.
You’ve been doing all the work around
the family, after all, and I haven’t been
doing anything of consequence, so I ﬁg-
ured the least I could do was take care
of this little problem.”
“But Haddo’s been with us since -”
“All the more reason for a change.”
She wasn’t going to let this go; he
knew her. If this kept up, Karlini was
sure he’d end up spilling the whole
thing, dribble by drop, which was ex-
actly what he knew he shouldn’t do.
Why was there never a diversion handy
when you -
What was the other Mont kid up to?
“What’s Jurtan doing over there with
the band?” Karlini said.

“He’s getting much better at dealing
with his problems,” Roni stated, “which
is more than I can say for some of the
other men around tonight.”
“That’s not fair, dear.”
“You want to discuss fair? Well, I’ll
tell you what’s fair ...”
Was it a Track?
Jurtan was won-
dering.
Or just some instinct?
Not
that it mattered what you called it, or
if there was really any difference be-
tween them. All he knew was that he’d
been wandering aimlessly into the club,
still thinking about his sister when he
could spare the time from concentrat-
ing on the pain in his stomach, when
all of a sudden he’d discovered himself
at the edge of the drawn-back cur-
tain at the foot of the circular thrust
stage.
On the stage, a small instru-
mental combo staffed by men in dark
glasses had been playing something en-

ticing in a haze of smoke. But maybe
he wasn’t sensing anything magical,
maybe it was just the music the band
was playing, the way it was unreeling
in a hypnotic coil, limp and cool and
brassy and sharp all at the same time.
So then what had brought Jurtan
back to awareness? One of the instru-
mentalists was addressing him, that’s
what it must have been. “My man,” the
fellow was saying out of the side of his
mouth, the other side being occupied
by a thin cigarette trailing a matching
line of blue exhaust. The smoke wound
its way upward around the neck of the
tall string bass the man was plunking.
“You look to be grooving there goodly.
What’s your instrument?”
“I, ah, I sort of play a bunch of stuff,”
Jurtan was surprised to hear himself
saying.
“You want to get on up here, then,

pick up that saxophone.
It’s Ploord’s
but he ain’t here yet anyhow. Show us
what you got.”
And then Jurtan found himself on
the stage, holding the saxophone and
blowing a tune that seemed to go along
with the line the others were laying
down. Had he ever just let his music
sense go off on its own like this with-
out any particular goal in mind? No, of
course not - but it still felt like it made
sense, as though it. . .
But then Jurtan decided to just quit
trying to analyze what was happening.
Like the bassist was telling him, there
was a groove going.
“Music,” muttered Svin.
And mod-
ern music at that. Civilization had so
many wrinkles to get accustomed to it
was amazing that anyone ever got any-
thing done.
“Are you sure I can’t buy you a drink?

A real drink, I mean?”
Svin was leaning against the low
wall that separated the bar from the
step-down ﬂoor holding the tables and
dance area that surrounded the stage.
The vantage point allowed him to keep
his various charges in sight, not that
any of them were showing any signs of
wanting to be in sight. The same could
scarcely be said of this Hazeel woman.
She was obviously trying not to be out
of his sight.
Of course, that was one wrinkle on
which civilization had nothing new to
teach him. “You may have heard I was
recently ill,” Svin told her.
“While I
was recovering, these juices made from
fruits and vegetables were very helpful.
Also, I am on duty.”
“Then can’t I get you something de-
cent to mix with your vegetables?”
“Do you have any more carrots?

Grated, not stirred. A splash of rhubarb
would also be tasty.”
Dalya Hazeel shook her head.
“I
don’t know about you. You’re a hunk,
no question about that,
but you’re
weird.”
“I used to be a barbarian.”
She grinned. “Some people used to
say the same thing about me. You want
to arm wrestle?”
Jurtan was still getting a strange
feeling; stranger than before, in fact.
He was having fun, he felt good - that
was strange enough by itself, but that
wasn’t the crux of it.
As his senses
seemed to ﬂoat free on top of the music,
he’d been having the same sensation
as he’d gotten from the Track, with
Max. Only it was different. It was like
- it was like ...
He watched another odd character

come in off the street, pause at the
top of the four-step entrance leading
down to the ringside ﬂoor, and eye
him deliberately across the room. This
character was a dwarf wearing a black
satin evening jacket that matched his
eyepatch, and a trimmed pointy-tipped
beard. The dwarf had his head cocked
slightly to the side as he considered
the music; then, as Jurtan’s riff came
to an end and the guy with the cor-
net launched into his own bit, the
dwarf seemed to reach a decision. He
straightened his shoulders and walked
briskly across the ﬂoor to the swinging
door to the kitchen, pushed through,
and vanished into the curl of steam
that met him coming out.
Just the same as the veiled woman
and the guy in the burnoose.
What had he done?
But Jurtan knew.
It wasn’t coin-

cidence, and it wasn’t his imagina-
tion, except indirectly.
He could feel
the Track himself.
It was there now
even though it hadn’t been when he’d
come in. But the thing that was differ-
ent about this Track was that it ran
through him.
Jurtan’s
playing
had
shanghaied
someone else’s Track in off the street.
That was assuming he hadn’t actually
laid down his own.
The guy with the biceps might be
an athlete, a swordsman, an up-and-
coming beat patroller for the police,
and good with the women (all by his
own admission, unasked for but tor-
rentially provided), and he might gen-
uinely appreciate this interminable
music her brother (of all people) had
decided he could play, but if the man
had an inkling of brains they could
ﬁt inside a peanut, or - if you wanted

to give him the beneﬁt of the doubt -
possibly a hulled-out ﬁlbert. “Uh-huh,”
said Tildy; it seemed about time to
say something again, not that she had
the slightest idea what he was talking
about.
But then why bother at all?
“Excuse me,” she stated, getting to her
feet and then strolling off.
Maybe in a minute or two he’d notice
she was gone. Or maybe not, but either
way it wasn’t her affair. She’d go talk to
Dalya ...
But Dalya was trying her best to
be occupied with Svin.
Huh!
Tildy
thought.
Well, maybe ex-barbarians
were her taste.
Although in her lim-
ited experience with Dalya, Tildy was
coming to suspect that anything ap-
proximately
human
but
unambigu-
ously male might do for Dalya in a
pinch.
If Dalya was busy with Svin, though,

she might not be watching what Tildy
ordered at the bar. “Ale,” Tildy told the
bartender.
“Ale it is then, miss.”
Or maybe Dalya didn’t really care,
despite her pronouncement earlier in
the evening.
Tildy put an elbow on
the bar and watched the barman ﬁddle
with his taps.
“Excuse me,” a man murmured next
to her.
“That oaf -” the man jerked
his head back in the direction of the
table she’d just left “- obviously doesn’t
appreciate the treasure he’s letting
escape. Will his mistake be my gain?”
“I don’t -” she began as she turned
to get a better look, “I -” And then she
got her look, at a head of hair so blond
that it looked a mere half-step from the
light metal of a shined-up sword; and
at those eyes, those clear blue eyes ...
“Would you care to dance?” asked the

man.
The number wound to an end. They’d
done at least three, and probably more
than six, but exactly how many beyond
that Jurtan had no idea.
Sweat was
still running down his face and the
rest of him was soaked, his eyes stung
from the smoke, and now that the
mouthpiece had left his lips he kept
coughing and clearing his throat and
half-gargling the contents of the glass
the cornetist had passed him - so why
did he feel so good?
The bassist clapped Jurtan on the
back. “That was one cool set,” he told
him, drawing out the long vowel sound
like another smooth horn note.
“We
the Underlings, man. You just set in
with us anytime; Ploord shoulda been
her on time. He gonna be out himself
one gig. You hear?”
“All right,” said Jurtan.
“Sounds

good. Uh, cool.”
“We make a real rockin’ cat out of
you yet, my man?”
“Sure,” Jurtan agreed, hoping he’d
been able to translate what the musi-
cian had said.
“I got to check some-
thing else out now.”
“Like you say, then.
Don’t forget,
now.”
Jurtan let himself into the small
backstage area and peered out through
the peephole that overlooked the room.
His lips were tingling, and his ﬁngers
too, but at least they weren’t worn
down and bloody in the way his music
sense had ground him up in the past.
Maybe it thought fun was supposed to
be, well, fun. But there was fun and
there was fun; there was music and
then there was what his sister had
been up to out on the ﬂoor, and now
out at that small side table. Her and

that tall dangerous-looking blond guy.
Jurtan’s internal music had honked
at him when the man had come in the
door. Floating along over the plunk of
the bass and the wail of the clarinet,
Jurtan had watched the man check
out the room. The light was low and
the air was murky, and to be frank
Jurtan knew he wasn’t quite all there
himself, but he’d thought that perhaps
the man’s gaze had lingered for a bit
longer than happenstance on Svin and
Dalya, on the Karlinis arguing off in
their booth, at Jurtan himself. And at
his sister.
And now here the two of them were,
Tildy and the guy, bent low across
the table’s candle in its red glass jar,
hands resting near each other on the
cloth. Any way you sliced the situation,
it wasn’t just an innocent conversation.
But then what did he know about it?

He’d been complaining about Max’s in-
struction, not Tildy, after all. Had he
picked up Max’s paranoia too?
But she was his sister. Either she’d
be in his debt or she’d never forgive
him.
Well, he’d keep an eye on things and
see what developed.
“Dear,” said Roni, “I still love you,
I’m sure I do, you know that, but I’m
not very fond of you at the moment. I
just can’t live this way, knowing there’s
something important you won’t trust
me with. I can’t do it, that’s all. Until
you can straighten out your mind I’m
going to have to ask you to leave.”

Chapter19
DRAT. AND DAMN! AND -
This was getting her nowhere. Leen
kicked back from her desk and glared
at the holograph logbooks spread out
across it. This was work, damn it, it
needed to be done, and she was the one
who needed to do it. But to do this kind
of work you generally needed a mind,
too. So where was hers?
From the evidence, nowhere in the
vicinity, that much was sure.

She was fast acquiring a unexpected
appreciation for the ways of the monas-
tic sects.
The attraction of the ivory
tower approach was that it removed
distractions.
If you forswore social
niceties and personal attachments you
were clearly better off when trying to
apply yourself to anything beyond -
“Auntie! Auntie Leen!”
Grateful for the distraction, Leen
left her desk behind and made her way
through the book rows to the storage
room she’d set aside as a nest for Robin.
She had set him up with one of the an-
cient spell-operated vision-viewers. He
was sitting rapt on a rug she’d spread
out on the ﬂoor in front of the thing.
“Auntie!” he was babbling.
“Look at
this! Look at this!”
In a dark space like a miniature
stage in the thing’s front, schematized
images were ﬂickering back and forth,

accompanied by tinny sounds.
Some-
times the viewer’s language was recog-
nizably one extinct dialect or another,
sometimes the sounds were totally un-
intelligible, and sometimes (as now)
there was no language to need inter-
pretation, rather just a sequence of
accent music and sounds that coun-
terpointed the action. Such as it was;
Leen had given the thing up herself
when she’d been not much older than
Robin since its repertoire had limited
appeal to someone who preferred to
use her mind.
Or had she given it up? To be hon-
est, the thing had remained a guilty
pleasure for ...
well, longer.
She’d
been hoping its programming would
improve, but -
No, actually, she’d enjoyed it. Until -
Why was she wasting time on use-
less old reminiscences?
Was it the

sight of the vision-story Robin in which
was engrossed at the moment, possibly
a morality tale of some sort played
out against a desert backdrop of harsh
buttes and precipitous gorges, with
its sole actors a slavering wolf and its
prey, an ambulatory bird of some sort?
Leen had watched the same characters
often enough herself, she was horriﬁed
to realize, but she had buried the mem-
ory for years. Was her mind breaking
down now?
Or to be more precise - or just more
honest - why was her mind breaking
down now?
“Not too much more of this,” Leen
told him. “Then it’s time for your read-
ing.”
Robin was already back in his trance,
though.
The viewer-thing was deﬁ-
nitely addictive.
Whether it was ac-
tively harmful, however, remained to

be proven.
The sounds of the looney contrap-
tion faded behind her as Leen traced
her steps reluctantly back to her own
work area.
She had to remember to
take Susannah to task. If Robin was
Leen’s child she’d certainly have taken
him to the Ball last night, for a short
time anyway, so he could at least get
the ﬂavor of things. Susannah’s house-
keeper had let Robin stay up so he
could watch the ﬁreworks from afar
but it was scarcely the same.
It was
too bad.
Robin was a charmer; he’d
have ﬁt right in. Maybe Leen’s sister
just hadn’t wanted the competition.
Competition - double damn!
Leen
was barely able to believe what had
transpired - how could she of all peo-
ple have let herself be sucked into a
morass like this?
The longstanding
enmity between the Scapula on one

hand and his brother and Max on the
other was clear, now that it was too
late for her to see it coming. And too
late for her to deny to herself that she
was more than casually interested in
at least one of the principals, and more
than casually wary of at least one of
the others.
And why couldn’t she leave it alone
now?
If all of a sudden she wanted
carnality there were no shortage of
opportunities. If she wanted someone
to talk to she could probably even ﬁnd
that.
She loved Robin; wasn’t that
enough?
Why did she suddenly have
to have everything all wrapped up in a
single person, when she hadn’t thought
she was even looking for any of it? Why
was it important that she might have
found it all in one?
But work still needed to be done, re-
gardless. Lord Farnsbrother had been

back again needing some research for
the ﬁnal scrollwork for his barge, and
needing it now;
after all, the Run-
ning of the Squids was coming up in
... in ... the next few days, wasn’t it?
Already? Then there was her own re-
search into the old secret room, too,
research which had led to these heaps
of old Archivist-ledgers out on her desk.
Why was this all happening at once?
These independent elements couldn’t
be connected, could they?
Only by the barest threads; to pre-
sume more would be to plunge into the
depths of abject paranoia, seeing con-
spiracies behind every door.
Unless she tried to associate the
pieces herself ...
Maybe she should share the puzzle
of the hidden room. Perhaps what she
needed was another perspective. She’d
gotten the feeling that Max might

know quite a bit about the nooks and
crannies of the extinct world.
There
had been something about that un-
usual amulet around his neck, for ex-
ample, something familiar, as though
she might have once seen it pictured
in an old book... That could be an ex-
cuse for meeting him again, to probe
whether he might be able to help her -
What was she thinking?
Why was
she looking for excuses, of all things?
Why –
Augh!
A softly chiming bell brought Leen’s
thoughts out of their endless circle.
Her pocket watch, right, reminding
her it was time to get ready for that
ridiculous luncheon. Why had she ever
agreed to make an appearance?
But
she had, and now there was no time
to waste. There was the Farnsbrother
stack, and here was her bag, and she’d

set the watch alarm to let her make
the next neutral cycle on the Front
Door and speed up her exit traverse
- there, the Front Door even saw her
coming and was creaking itself open in
advance. Leen tried to clear her mind.
It would be a muddy traverse unless
she could concentrate. She felt for the
currents and set her feet. Except -
Damn! Something was still nagging
at her mind.
Something she’d forgot-
ten?
Leen inhaled deeply. Her mind was
undeniably a mess.
But now it was time to concentrate.
Whatever it was she couldn’t think of,
she’d worry about it later.
This was worse than bad form, it
was just bad. But there was nothing
to do except go ahead. Max adjusted
his hood again, leaving no more skin
exposed along his body than the thin

slit across his eyes, and hung back in
the shadows. His trace on the Archive
monitors said she was still on the Front
Door path on her way out. The Back
Door in its hidden alcove was down
the hall and around the bend from his
current position, in one of the doorless
cells in this derelict section of the dun-
geon, but Max had learned last time
that the guard systems made a habit
of examining passers-by even before
they approached a door with the goal
of passing through. He didn’t want to
risk confusing the defenses, or even
worse giving them the right idea; they
might be bright enough to sort that
out, anyway.
The monitors weren’t the only thing
around that might be confused.
Max
felt
confused
enough
for
everyone.
What damnfool rotten luck - here he
was running out a plan he’d had in

process for who knew how long and he
had to go get interested in his target
as a person. The way to do this kind
of thing right was for a target to be a
target; you couldn’t worry about their
feelings or whether they’d hate you if
they found out or even if there’d be
enough left of them to mop off the ﬂoor
afterwards, much less feel anything
one way or the other.
You couldn’t
care.
And he never had.
Not for a long time, anyway.
Not
since he’d gotten good at this.
Not
until now.
Damn.
But he was still going through with
it. He had to go through with it.
And if he worked things right there
was no reason Leen would ever know.
Then he could ﬁnd out just what he
felt about her without business hang-

ing over his head.
Not that he should feel anything in
the ﬁrst place, but trying to convince
himself of that looked like just about
a lost cause at the moment. The only
thing to do was to try to contain the
damage. Maybe he could still talk him-
self out of it... It would make things a
lot simpler. It would put things back
the way he’d always liked them to be -
clean, slick, with no grease to slow him
down and no entanglement to limit his
options -
Fat chance.
What had happened to him?
Concentrate on the job, Max told him-
self. That’s what you’re here for, after
all.
That was no more than the truth.
And since Leen had cleared the far
end of the path and was exiting the
matrix’s sensing range, it was time to

move.
The ﬁrst step was the most critical.
Max invoked the trigger phrase for the
aural cloak and felt the thing began to
unfold.
His vision went gray, sounds
faded, a prickly wave ran hot and cold
down his body, but the real dislocation
was the wrenching twist of his sense of
self. A blur of sensory memories rifﬂed
through his mind. He was - she was? -
they were thinking that -
But then Max’s reﬂexes began to re-
assert themselves, and his own aura
damped itself down and encapsulated
itself, and the cloak began to withdraw
its interdigitations from his core and to
become at last merely ... a cloak. Max
did his deep breathing focus exercise
and felt himself start to even out.
Disguising yourself in someone else’s
aura was sometimes an indispensable
technique but it did have its costs.

From Max’s experience, those spell-
workers who favored the procedure
still liked to use nonsentients as their
cloak-models. With good reason - the
more deﬁned a self-image the subject
had, the more you had to be careful not
to be absorbed into their personality
ﬁeld rather than wearing it as a shell.
It was a far cry from a muskrat to a
human.
It was also another jump to move
from just any human to one with whom
you had some personal relationship.
But how could he have known? At the
same time as his preprogrammed au-
ral probe had been interrogating Leen
during their meeting at the ball, read-
ing her standing waves and soaking up
those spiking energy gradients, fulﬁll-
ing the purpose that had caused Max
to seek her out in the ﬁrst place, Max
himself had been -

Had been...
No, dammit, Max thought. I won’t
accept that. I gave all that up.
And so he had. But it appeared, as
Shaa would have it, that fate had inter-
vened.
Better to sort it out later; now was
clearly not the time.
Max pulled the goggles with the
dark-vision ﬁeld down over his eyes,
left his hiding place, and made his
way through the dust, leakage from
the aural cloak helping him to achieve
the right gait. The corridor was dark;
when you put that together with the
dust, it made a good sign that no one
had bothered to come around lately.
Perhaps
the
palace
administrators
were conserving on candles. Through
the goggles, though, the way stood
out under a ﬂat pink light.
The illu-
mination faded twenty or thirty feet

out, becoming even more spectral and
ghostly, but all he really needed was –
There, around the corner, keeping
to its own pool of shadow even in
the goggle-enhanced perception, that’s
where it should be.
An unbroken ex-
panse of stone wall?
No, of course
not.
Max let loose the second-order
perception spell, and was rewarded by
a dancing green line that snaked its
way up and around the stones.
Max
held out his hand and approached the
Back Door.
This was clearly the ﬁrst moment of
hazard. Max felt the door interrogat-
ing his aura like blunt thorns denting
the surface of a balloon.
Something
rifﬂed through the surface layers of
his mind ... or Leen’s mind, rather, as
captured by his recording device. Max
caught a sideglow from her thoughts
wafting past him like the old scent

from a pressed ﬂower...
So she thought she might like him
too, did she?
Max had told himself he wouldn’t
tap into her thoughts.
That was per-
ilously close to the kind of violation
at which he’d always drawn the line,
and that was with subjects he never
planned to see again. But you couldn’t
totally seal yourself from the damp
when you were working underwater,
either...
What a mess, thought Max.
The guard systems were obviously
thinking something over, perhaps try-
ing to understand how Leen had made
it from the Front Door to the Back
Door so quickly. It was a potential ﬂaw
in Max’s plan, true, but there had been
no evidence that the path guardians
worked with that level of contextual
and historical information. With tim-

ing presenting the problems it did, it
had seemed a risk worth taking. After
all, Max had the advantage of having
done this before, too. It had been years
before,
admittedly,
and the subject
then had been a different Archivist,
Leen’s grandfather apparently, but as
long as the same systems were still in
place there was no reason for it not to
work again ...
With the rumble of rock on rock,
an opening appeared.
All his sensor-
augmented
perceptions
stretching,
Max carefully placed his foot in what
appeared to be the right place on the
threshold and went through.
The Back Door ground itself shut
behind him.
Ahead was the Three-
Floored Room, and after that Creeley’s
labyrinth.
If Creeley hadn’t enjoyed
a habit of bragging a little too freely
about his creations to a diary-keeping

conﬁdant, and if Max hadn’t had his
own habit of compulsively reading ev-
erything he unearthed,
Max would
have had no idea of what to expect
going in. He might still have made it
the other time, but the labyrinth in
particular, and then the Water Gate,
could have potentially -
Concentrate. Max told himself. And
indeed there was much to concentrate
on.
He had already passed through
the vestibule and into the room shaped
like an inverted pyramid with the tip
lopped off.
Straight ahead was the
obvious exit - and an immediate one-
way trip to doom.
Creeley didn’t let
you make a mistake twice.
Instead,
Max put one foot up on the steep in-
clined wall in what felt like the right
place, pushed off with the other leg,
and propelled himself up in a quick
sprint. Two steps, three, now feeling

as though gravity would coax him into
the inevitable backﬂip any instant -
but then instead, there he was pound-
ing upside down into the ceiling. One
more step - where was it?
There. The ceiling, in another play
of shadow on shadow, concealed an in-
verted pit. Max fell up into the hole,
rolled forward away from the lip, and
came back in a crouch to his feet.
The Three-Floored Room,
indeed.
Well, it was only illusion anyway, that’s
all, and Creeley hadn’t wanted his
Archivists to turn into desk-bound
slugs, either, but really.
There were clearly walls close around
but for all the world it felt as though
Max had emerged onto an endless
windswept plain covered with head-
high grass.
Last time it had been a
forest. The pits would still be the same,
though, even if they felt like quagmire

bogs this go-around. This was where
the incantations would start, too.
Max lost track of time.
Pace after
pace, step after step, each one precise
even if it meant serious contortions to
achieve. Into the Walk of Glass, climb-
ing apparently unsupported into the
air, then the Pirouette Gate, then that
live guardian -
It was sure a lot of trouble for a pile
of books.
You had to respect someone who did
this for a living, though.
In fact, if you -
Max wrenched his thoughts back.
One of those ﬂoating distraction zones,
no doubt. His aural cloak was under
interrogation again, too. Had anything
out-of-kilter leaked through?
Tunnel walls closed in again.
Bob-
bing and weaving through the tracery
of the ﬁeld matrix, Max had already

slid past the bend gates before he real-
ized he’d even come that far. Were the
guardians giving him a break because
they ﬁgured he - or she - had just gone
through a traverse a few moments be-
fore? Had he found a shortcut? Scenes
from a life he hadn’t lived were ﬂash-
ing through the air an inch in front of
his eyes - stacks of books and piles of
papers, people he didn’t know but felt
quick twinges of emotion for, here a jolt
of anger, there a bubble of warmth; a
cock-eyed parrot...
Another step forward and the bliz-
zard stopped. Something tried to push
him forward, off-balance; he resisted,
carefully took the next deliberate step.
The ﬂoor seemed to crumble beneath
his foot.
No, it isn’t, Max thought
ﬁrmly, and indeed the sliding gravel
did ﬁrm up and decide to support
his weight.
Ahead was nothing but

blank wall.
Max narrowed his eyes
and glared at it in a way that felt like
authentic Leen.
A line of light appeared at the level
of the ﬂoor, widened into a rectangle,
and elongated itself upward. Max bent
and stepped through while it was still
moving.
The dim light came from a guttering
lantern on a stand next to a cluttered
desk.
Beyond the desk were books,
endless and inﬁnite.
The Back Door
creaked down again behind him and
seated itself with a dull boom.
Well, that hadn’t been too bad. He’d
rest for a moment or two and then -
No, he wouldn’t.
Why bother with
all that physical conditioning if not to
keep moving at a time like this? Leen
might be at her luncheon for hours but
then again she might not, and anyway
if he wasn’t lucky it could take days to

ﬁnd the stuff he was after.
So there
wasn’t a moment to lose ...
What was that?
Sounds. A low tinny ﬂickering sound
at the borders of hearing, and atop that
a bubbly laugh. Down to the right and
along the aisle. Max crept along, up to
a closed door. The sounds were coming
from behind it.
Max put himself at the ready, manip-
ulated the door-catch, eased the door
open a crack, and slipped noiselessly
through.
A low boxy contraption was con-
tributing the tinny sounds, and a ﬂick-
ering light of illusion spreading out
before it across a shaggy area rug. The
laughter was coming from the rug, or
more precisely from the small tousled-
hair boy sprawled in the middle of it.
This was nothing to panic over.
It
was never worth panicking.

Max knew that, and he’d trained his
body to know that too, except that one
by one various organs, starting with
his stomach, seemed to be tossing their
lessons out wholesale.
“Hi,” said the boy. “Who are you?”
At least the kid wasn’t going to
throw a tantrum.
What had Leen
taught him? Enough not to be spooked
by a sneaky-looking guy dressed in
black with a black face-hood that cov-
ered everything from his eyebrows
on up and his eye-sockets on down.
“You’re Robin, right?”
The boy nodded vigorously. “Who are
you?” he repeated.
Max hesitated. If he told Robin his
name was Max, Robin would tell Leen
and there would go his plan of sneak-
ing into the Archives with Leen never
the wiser. But if he told Robin some-
thing else he’d still tell Leen, and she’d

still know someone had been creeping
around behind her back.
Maybe she
could ﬁgure it out; Max thought he
could, given the right clues, and it was
always a bad idea to underestimate
your adversaries.
Except Leen wasn’t an adversary.
Or more to the point, she hadn’t
been an adversary.
Now who knew
what might happen.
Of course, if Robin told Leen some-
one had been visiting, Max could hap-
pen to worm that fact out of her and
then volunteer to help her ﬁnd the
culprit while upgrading the Archival
defenses ...
It was a tricky plan but
it might work. The start was to give
Robin a false story. “I’m -” began Max.
What was that?
Had the wall rippled?
Had some-
thing creaked, was someone sneaking
up behind him?
Then Max realized

what had tugged at his attention. He
was still attuned to the rhythms of the
Archive entry-path patterns. They had
been quiescent since he’d ﬁnished his
traverse, but they were quiet no longer.
There was something strange going on
back there.
Oh, Leen thought. Damn! Her mind
was worse than a mess, it was a com-
plete disaster area.
How could she
have forgotten Robin, of all things?
She was already late for the lun-
cheon, too, and she had promised to
be there. She couldn’t just leave Robin
alone in the depths of the ...
Could she?
He did have a hamper of snacks, and
he did have things to play with, and
the Doors wouldn’t let him wander into
the traversal hazards, and she could
just bounce in quickly to the luncheon,
make her greetings and show herself

around, and then sneak back out. She
could ...
but on the other hand she
couldn’t.
Not to Robin.
She’d most
likely never forgive herself, even if
Robin was still in the same position on
his rug when she returned as he’d been
when she’d left.
There was Susannah, too.
She’d
never let Leen forget it either. If she
found out. Damn, damn, damn -
“Archivist?” It was Vellum. Leen re-
alized she had paused halfway through
the Reading Room, an undoubtedly
blank expression on her face, in the
same spot where the realization had
hit her.
“Nothing, Vellum,” she said.
“It’s
nothing.
I just remembered I forgot
something downstairs I’ll need to go
back and get.
You take care of Lord
Farnsbrother.”
“Are you certain you’re ...”

But she was already leaving him
behind. She had, she realized, appar-
ently made up her mind.
If she was
going back down there was no time to
waste.
She had already touched up her face
on her way out of the anteroom; if she
had a quick passage in and out this
time she might not need to do it up
again.
That could save a minute or
two.
The path might still be at the
same calibration levels as well; that
would save additional time on the tra-
verse. She should still be able to make
it to lunch while they were still on the
appetizer, or at worst, the salad.
Susannah would never know,
of
course,
Leen
thought
on
her
way
through the stacks heading toward
this terminus of the Front Door route.
Robin would never stir, either. It might
be smarter just to go for the luncheon

ﬁrst and leave when they reached the
salad.
If anyone found out they could just
add the anecdote to her reputation.
Max, though ... what would he think
of her?
She had the impression that
how someone dealt with responsibility
was important to him. Robin was her
responsibility, at least at the moment,
and she’d walked away from it.
Leen was tired of standing back from
herself and asking why Max’s possible
reaction made any difference at all
to her in the ﬁrst place.
It just did,
that’s all. She took a deep breath, tried
to compose her mind, and rested her
hand on the Front Door.
It stuck.
Come on, now! she emoted at it.
The door creaked indecisively. What
was wrong with it, anyway?
“You know me,” Leen said out loud.

That did it.
With another reluc-
tant squeal, the door rolled open. She
stepped through into the launch cham-
ber, felt for the matrix, and set her feet
in the start position.
The matrix, though, was reacting
sluggishly, indecisively.
Of all the
times to have the thing act up, of
course this had to be it. Leen gritted
her teeth and moved ahead.
It was as if she were doing the
breaststroke in a pool ﬁlled with mo-
lasses. Actually, the situation suddenly
became stranger than that.
She had
been pushing forward against resis-
tance when the resistance suddenly
vanished; when this happened she al-
most ﬂung herself forward, propelled
by the extra force she was applying to
each step - almost, but not quite.
It
was strange.
Nothing like this had
ever happened before.

It might be better to spend a moment
catching her bearings again, but on the
other hand it might not. Stopping in
the middle of a traverse could be dan-
gerous. Going out of control or off the
path, however, could be even worse.
She did have momentum, though, and
that decided it.
Leen forged ahead,
reaching the downward spiral.
The second time the traverse ﬂopped
on her she was ready; she handled it
without even breaking stride.
The
guard ﬁelds were still radiating confu-
sion, a confusion Leen certainly shared.
The third time around, then, when the
matrix seemed to crystallize around
some sudden decision,
perhaps she
should have expected it more than she
actually did. Leen was braced for the
same drop in resistance followed by an
incremental ratchet back up.
Indeed,
the drop did follow.
That wasn’t the

problem.
The real problem was that
that wasn’t the only shift that came in
with it.
Leen had reduced the force of her
own pressure against the retarding
force so that she wouldn’t catapult
ahead out of control; that’s what had
worked the earlier times. Instead, she
took a small easy step ahead and to
the right. Under the pattern that had
been established, she’d now have a
moment to recapture her strength as
the next obstruction slowly built. Leen
carefully shifted her weight into the
next step, and froze.
It took her a moment to understand
that her dead stop wasn’t discretionary.
There had been no slow increase in
drag. It had happened all at once, and
to a much greater level. So great, in
fact, she discovered as she threw her
full force into it, that she was com-

pletely immobilized.
As stuck as an
ancient ﬂy in a chunk of amber.

Chapter20
“WHAT’S THAT?” ZALZYN SHAA
SAID BRIGHTLY. “Over there?”
“There” turned out to be a park, and
in the park a meadow. A small crowd
of revellers still going strong from the
previous night had spread out just in-
side of the tree line, surrounding a
group of half-a-dozen brown-skinned
men wearing white shirts decorated
with geometric embroidery in various
primary colors.
The men were play-

ing rhythmically on underarm drums,
a whistle, and assorted bells, while
another half-dozen similarly garbed
fellows ran back and forth across the
meadow in front of them in crisscross-
ing groups of three. In each threesome,
one pair had suspended between them
a line of cowbells. The third member
of the trio wore on his head a papier-
mâché efﬁgy of a large shark.
“No, a swordﬁsh, I believe,” said
Shaa.
“Observe the serrated nasal
attachment.”
“I suppose,” said the Great Karlini.
“But isn’t that dorsal ﬁn hooked on
with rivets?”
“Be careful,” Shaa advised.
“You
don’t want to profane someone’s ritual
or, worse yet, antagonize their ances-
tor.”
Ahead of them, the trios had now
broken up and the bell-carriers were

pursuing the ﬁsh-heads,
with obvi-
ously serious intent. Karlini, however,
had become once more intent himself
on an intensive study of the ground.
In the midst of a city breaking out in
festivities, Karlini had been parked on
Shaa’s doorstep when Shaa had stag-
gered home in the early hours. Shaa
had been somewhat the worse for wear
himself at that point but his spirits
were by no means in the basement.
The same could scarcely be said for
Karlini. Shaa could not recall ever see-
ing one of his circle looking as bedrag-
gled and woebegone. He couldn’t think
of anyone he’d encountered projecting
quite as complete an image of morose
dejection, in fact.
So if Shaa had been looking for some-
thing new to occupy his attention, that
something had clearly arrived.
Not
that Shaa would admit it, but seeing

Karlini so totally miserable had served
to elevate his own mood, at least by
comparison.
And at least so far.
It
was unclear how much of this he could
take without being sucked down by the
undertow.
Obviously it was better for Karlini
to be out rather than vegetating in a
closed room; hence this midday con-
stitutional. Perhaps the surroundings
would help to moderate the blow when
they discussed what needed to be dis-
cussed, perhaps not. Still, regardless
of the surroundings, there was no point
in putting off the discussion any longer.
“So what do you propose to do?” Shaa
asked idly, looking away from Karlini
at the revellers to soften the opening
blow.
“I don’t know,” said the Great Kar-
lini. “I never thought it would come to
this.”

“I still have only the roughest con-
cept of what ‘it’ is,” commented Shaa.
“Being thrown out by Roni is obviously
a cardinal feature, but I’m sure it is
scarcely the only one. Hmm? Very well,
keep your peace if you must. Shall we
discuss this another way? To what do
you attribute your present impasse?”
“... I can’t talk about it.”
“I see,” Shaa said. “That would ex-
plain some part of the issue, certainly.
I take it there is also a self-referential
component to the situation? Which is
to say, the fact that you can’t discuss
this with your wife, either, is related to
the fact that it concerns your wife?”
“You always did like listening at key-
holes, didn’t you?”
“My superior insight only makes it
seem that way,” Shaa said, with his
own nod at self-referentiality; a typi-
cally auto-sarcastic lip contortion too

ironic to be called a grin. “And are you
in this bind by yourself and of your
own volition?”
“... Yes. Yes, I am.”
“From the totally unconvincing na-
ture of that response, I will take that
as a ﬁrm ‘no.’ So, what does that leave
us with?”
“Don’t worry about me. I’ve got some
ideas. I can get the baggage out of the
way and then talk Roni out of -”
Shaa raised a hand. “Stop. This situ-
ation has clearly gone beyond business
into the personal. More subterfuge will
not point the way toward resolution.”
“You got something else to recom-
mend? Oh, who cares anyway,” Karlini
said heavily. “I love my wife. We had
a ﬁne life.
Now everything’s falling
apart.
What did I do wrong?
What
happened?”
“How far back do you want to go?”

“You don’t have to sound so ... clin-
ical about the whole thing,” Karlini
grumbled.
“Why don’t you tell me
what you’re planning to do about your
problems?”
A ticklish question. Fortunately he
had a deﬂective answer. “Lunch,” Shaa
said promptly.
“Lunch? You think you can eat your
way out of your mess? Anyway I’m not
hungry.”
That was just as well, since it saved
a subterfuge to deal with the fact that
Karlini wasn’t invited. “Suit yourself,”
Shaa told him.
“You don’t intend to
jump off a bridge while you’re out of my
sight, do you?”
“I could just as well ask you the same
thing.
You were the one who almost
ﬂung himself off a boat.”
“It remains a recourse of last re-
sort,” acknowledged Shaa. “I don’t see

it being required today, however. It’s
Haddo, isn’t it?”
Karlini started. “Haddo? What do
you mean, Haddo?”
“Who’s enmeshed you in whatever
it is you’re enmeshed in. Who’s been
sneaking around even more than usual.
Who’s been holding side consultations
with everyone else in your household
except your wife, so who through the
principle of logical completeness had
to be in touch with you as well. Who
has an interesting history in the far
frozen north, along with a repertoire of
talents that are equally interesting, if
not more so. That Haddo.”
“Have you been talking with that de-
tective guy again?”
“Yes,” Shaa said,
“but not about
this.”
Karlini looked up at the sky. A ﬂock
of seagulls had been circling, evaluat-

ing the edibility of the papier-mâché
ﬁsh helmets no doubt, but now one
of them separated from the mass and
swooped down.
“Great,” Karlini said,
bracing himself. “That’s all I need. The
one member of my entourage who’s
willing to be seen with me is - OWP!
Watch those claws!”
The seagull screeched at him, bat-
ting his face with an outstretched wing.
Then, apparently considering its point
made, the seagull ﬂuffed itself and set-
tled down atop Karlini’s left shoulder.
“You could go to sea and become a pi-
rate,” suggested Shaa.
“Arr!” screeched the seagull.
“I don’t need your opinion,” Karlini
told the bird. “Who are you, anyway?
Why do you keep following me around?”
But the gull had ostentatiously closed
its eyes in a show of going presumably
to sleep.

“Perhaps it just likes you,” Shaa
said.
“Do you really think so?” said Kar-
lini, his mood brightening for a mo-
ment.
He glanced at the bird and
his face fell again. “No, of course not.
This isn’t coincidence; nothing’s coin-
cidence anymore.
The thing’s some-
body’s agent.
Just because I haven’t
turned up any gods who use seagulls
as their avatar doesn’t mean they’re
not around.”
“Could it be a friend of Haddo’s?”
“Haddo again - why do you keep
harping on Haddo?”
Shaa was watching the sky him-
self, on the off chance that the seagull
might really have merely taken a shine
to Karlini, and might further be acting
as a trend-setter for its ﬂock. “I have
been making certain inquiries concern-
ing Haddo.
Enough to underline the

desirability of learning more. There is
more to him than meets the eye.”
“You could say that about any of us.”
“If anything that only underscores
my point. Ask him sometime about a
fellow called Dortonn.
You might as
well ensure that that ‘sometime’ hap-
pens soon, too. On the other hand, you
might consult with Wroclaw.”
“Roni wants me to stay away.”
“What does that have to do with it?
Wroclaw isn’t restricted to his room. In-
deed, behold.”
Karlini followed the line of Shaa’s
outstretched arm.
Coming toward
them across the lawn was, in fact, Wro-
claw. “Maybe he followed the seagull,”
Karlini muttered.
“Good morning, sir,” Wroclaw said
to Karlini, as he approached to within
conversational range. “I dropped your
things at Dr. Shaa’s, and -”

“Wroclaw,” said Shaa.
“Yes, sir?”
“How long have we known each
other? Decades, most likely?”
Wroclaw looked a bit nonplused.
“Quite possibly so, sir.”
“How many times have I tried to
convince you not to call me by those
honoriﬁcs? How often have we talked
about the extent to which they perpet-
uate a class-stratiﬁed society?”
“Many, doubtlessly.”
“So do you persist in doing it out of
contrariness, or is there some other
reason rooted in ideology?”
“Has
your
encounter
with
your
brother put you off your mood, sir?”
suggested Wroclaw.
Shaa took over the role of nonplused
recipient of a conversational lob. “... As
you say,” he said after a moment, “quite
possibly.”

“Just so, then,” Haddo said, “sir. If I
may be so bold, you’d best be off or no
doubt you’ll miss your lunch date.”
Shaa’s expression changed to one
implying a good deal of sudden mental
activity. “I see,” he stated. “Quite right.
You have your key, Great One? Good;
I’ll see you back at the house later,
then, no doubt.” After another quick
sharp glance at Wroclaw, Shaa added,
“I’m off, then,” turned, and headed for
the street.
Karlini, watching him go, said, “Nice
to see you, Wroclaw. What do you think
I should do now?”
“Not that it would be my place to
advise you, sir, yet it might be appro-
priate for you and me to discuss our
colleague Haddo, his plans, and our
places in them.”
“Let’s take a walk,” Karlini proposed.
“I think there’s a pond around here

somewhere.
Unless you have to get
right back?”
“You’ve always encouraged me to
manage my own time, sir.”
“Yeah,” said Karlini, his hands sunk
back in his pockets as he trudged along,
“but everything’s changed now.”
“Not necessarily everything, sir.”
“Huh. Tell me this, then. How did
you ﬁnd me, Wroclaw?”
“Why, just as you suggested, sir.”
“Me? What did I suggest?”
“I followed the seagull,” Wroclaw
said. “You see, my people have rather
a long relationship with waterfowl.”
So, Shaa was thinking as he made
his way back into trafﬁc, yet another
player whose role needs reinterpreta-
tion. Was no one the person they ap-
peared to be? Was their world merely
a seething mass of counterplots and
intrigues? What ever happened to an

honest day’s work and a spot of theater
in the evenings?
Perhaps it would be just as well to
stop ﬁghting, to make a stand in the
street and let the oncoming carriage
trafﬁc compress him into the dust. If
your friends no longer seemed to be
what you’d thought they were, and
your goals seemed to shift and vanish
in the fog, and the day-to-day was -
Lunch; perhaps that would be the
ticket.
“I knew I never should have
read that article on moral relativism,”
Shaa muttered to no one in particular.
Especially before bed last night, with
his head - and his mind - in the shape
they’d been in.
If the ﬁrm anchor of
certainty in one’s position and its un-
derlying rationale was swept away in
the recognition of the equal validity
of multiple interchangeable frames of
reference, it certainly didn’t help one

ﬁnd solid reasons for hanging around
...
Away from Karlini and his distract-
ing distress, it was clear to Shaa that
his mood was starting to seriously slip.
Yet there was still lunch. The food by
itself was scarcely the attraction, al-
though the branch of the Adventurers’
Club up ahead was justly famed for the
products of its kitchen, at least among
the adventurous. Rather, the potential
of the invitation itself was the main
draw.
An older stone building amply colon-
naded beckoned, and within, an as-
cending staircase.
A between-ﬂoors
alcove - ah, here was the reception
gauntlet.
Shaa displayed the crested
envelope, then withdrew the folded
invitation to display that too. The mes-
sage was merely a brief scrawl with
date, time, and place.
The signature

below, for such it obviously was even
though it was graphical instead of al-
phabetic, had the desired effect. Shaa
examined it again as he followed the
maitre d’ into the dining room.
Al-
though one could argue that Shaa and
the letter-writer were in the same line
of work they had never ofﬁcially met;
still, the signature was unambiguous
in context. The maitre d’ indicated a
side table with a very good window
view over the street and a corner of the
park beyond; the table was set for two.
One place was already occupied by an
extremely red-headed fellow squint-
ing out at the bright scene beneath a
somewhat overhung expression. Shaa
slipped into the other seat. “The Craw-
ﬁsh, I presume?”
“What’s going on with my sister,
that’s what I want to know,” the man
said, not diverting his gaze from the

window.
“Arleen the Archivist?” Shaa said.
“That sister?
Or perhaps Susannah,
the
well-known
socialite,
not
that
there’s much to ﬁgure out in that direc-
tion beyond the obvious interpersonal
intrigues?”
“Been doing your homework, then,
have you?”
Shaa inclined his head. “A pleasure
to make your acquaintance as well.”
He extended the inclination into an
outright craning of the neck to match
the Crawﬁsh’s angle of view.
“Am I
missing something of interest? To my
inadequate eye it looks to be a straight-
forward street scene.”
“Habit, I suppose,” said the Craw-
ﬁsh, continuing his stare.
“What do
you suppose your brother is up to?”
“Aside from no good? Of course you
realize I may be biased.”

“Of course. Don’t bother to ask me if
I’ve asked him, either. I’m on his list.”
“You’re not short of company. I imag-
ine you’ve already ordered?”
“I’m having the squab with chilies
and various steamed vegetables;
I
thought you’d like the turbot in citrus.”
“We shall see,” Shaa stated.
Two
pots of tea had arrived, one at Shaa’s
elbow. Shaa sniffed at the vapors and
raised an eyebrow.
“They’ll
bring
more
without
the
herbs if you’d rather,” the Crawﬁsh
told him.
“No reason for that, as long as the
dosage is accurately calibrated.” Shaa
took a sip.
“You can understand my reason for
asking.”
“Certainly,” Shaa agreed. “Your sis-
ter and my brother, and now my asso-
ciate Maximillian as well - whom else

would you want to consult with? How
long have you been working with my
sister?”
“Is that deduction or did you have
some evidence?” said the Crawﬁsh.
“No matter, I suppose.”
“Obviously Eden would need some-
one to keep my brother under scrutiny,
seeing as neither she nor I have been
in a position to do it directly.” Shaa
shrugged. “You would clearly be a lead-
ing candidate, even if it weren’t for
your mother.”
The Crawﬁsh turned from the win-
dow to eye Shaa directly.
“Don’t you
think some things should remain un-
spoken?”
“Do you?”
“I’m actually more worried about
your brother than I told Leen. He is up
to something, there’s no question about
that, and it seems like something ma-

jor. You don’t think he’d outﬂank the
new Emperor and slip into his place
before the Knitting, do you?”
“I wouldn’t put anything past him,
but that would sounds a tad egregious
even for Arznaak. He’d rather spin a
plan out over years.”
“Just my point,” said the Crawﬁsh.
“Here you are back in Peridol at last.
Some type of end-game must be at
hand. But how does it link to my sis-
ter?”
“There will be at least two levels,”
Shaa observed, “or my brother is se-
riously off his game.
Access to the
Archives would be an obvious place to
start.”
“Is that your Max’s goal? Or is he on
multiple levels too?”
“Always,” drawled Shaa. “Yet in this
case Maximillian seems to have been
taken signiﬁcantly aback. I believe he

has a genuine feeling for your sister,
and she for him; and I suspect fur-
thermore that neither of them is very
pleased with that state of affairs. So to
speak.”
“There was an incursion into the
Archives some years back,” the Craw-
ﬁsh said. “A one-shot that was never
repeated. I’ve always been on the look-
out for whoever was behind it. Until I
caught a glimpse of that amulet Max
had around his neck last night, that
is.”
Perhaps they had arrived at the
crux of the matter.
Well, perhaps
they would still be sitting cordially
at the table when the entrees arrived,
and perhaps not. “Is that where that
amulet came from?
Max has spent
time with some shady customers, you
know; he could have acquired it from
one of them.”

“You know,” the Crawﬁsh said con-
versationally,
“after that little con-
tretemps last night I might be asking
myself how closely I wanted to cleave
to Maximillian, should I have hap-
pened to be his partner, given the
divergence of means that appeared to
be in evidence.”
“Might you,” Shaa said in an equally
even tone.
“Of course. I also might be reconsid-
ering my own position, but for myself
that would clearly be a short and fruit-
less exercise. With a brother like the
Scapula, though, the exercise might
deserve more attention.” The Crawﬁsh
leaned back in his chair and regarded
Shaa directly.
“But there is yet an-
other possibility to consider.
Given
that the various players on this stage
are mostly known quantities, whose re-
actions within basic parameters might

be reasonably well anticipated, could
your brother be anticipating them?”
“I don’t think we’re as predictable as
all that,” said Shaa, but not without
a noticeable pause. Arznaak wasn’t a
god; he couldn’t possibly have a plan
that intricate. Could he?
What gods might he be working
with?
This Crawﬁsh was rather clever, at
that. “An intriguing thesis,” Shaa told
him. “Farfetched, but intriguing.”
“Well, I try. Now, on the other hand
...”
After all that, Shaa was still here
and the turbot had arrived, citrus gar-
nish and all. At this point he was not
surprised to ﬁnd the citrus sauce sur-
prisingly appropriate.
The Crawﬁsh
indeed was looking to be a usefully
substantive fellow.
Clearly, Shaa thought, the cure for

his ennui would need more than some
new faces and a change of scene. But
that didn’t mean they might not be a
fruitful start.

Chapter21
WAS I ASLEEP OR AWAKE? Awake,
I decided; even those nightmare dreams
I’d heard about couldn’t possibly make
a body quite as miserable as I was
feeling right at the moment.
If I
was awake, then, I’d better get up.
Maybe the front desk had some witch-
doctor remedy that could hoist me
back into the ranks of the glad-to-be-
alive. I hoisted an eyelid. Bright lights
slammed through the gap with an ice-

pick slash. My eyes slapped shut and I
fell back, thinking about other options
- most of which involved throwing up
- and listening to someone moaning
loudly in my own voice.
I’d never had a hangover like this in
my life. It must have meant I was out
of practice in something. I hadn’t ac-
tually consumed that much when I’d
been out with Shaa, really I hadn’t, but
here it had to be already the middle of
the morning and I could barely bear to
lie still, let alone struggle up and set
about doing whatever it was I had to do.
Still, given that at some point I must
have regained consciousness, by the in-
exorable logic of things that meant in
turn that at some other point I would
have to get out of bed, too, if only to
try to hunt down a cure. Or if not a
curative to restore me to health, then
something to put me out of my misery.

For the time being, however, I ﬁgured
that trying not to move and hoping the
world would go away was probably the
most appropriate strategy.
“So,” said a voice from the side of the
bed, “you are here, after all.”
A voice? Not again, I thought, but
sure enough it was. And not just any
voice, either. This was a voice I recog-
nized.
As if I’d been encountering any other
kind since I’d arrived in town.
There was no question but that I’d
have to speak to the management.
I
had a suite that was supposed to be
guarded against incursions, where I
was supposedly registered under a
cloak of incognito - as though I ever
traveled under any other kind - and
yet here anyone who pleased had no
problem in popping up as close to me
as the nearest end table.

“Even I was surprised at how low
you’ve sunk,” said a second voice, from
the other side. “Crawling through gut-
ters no less. This is not a sign of person-
ality, you know, not a sign of character.
In Oolsmouth I even thought -”
I ﬁgured I might as well deal with
her ﬁrst.
“If you were thoughtful
enough to bring a pitcher of water with
you,” I told her, “you might as well go
ahead and pour it over my head now.”
“As I said,” Jill responded, “a clear
denizen of the slums.”
I gritted my teeth and opened my
eyes. If she didn’t have a restorative, I
seemed to recall I might have my own.
There it was, on the end table next to
her; a brimming ﬂask. But there she
was, too, putting out a hand to stop me,
assuming no doubt that my debilitated
state would keep me from resisting
even that feeble effort.

Actually, if I’d had a chance to think
about it I’d have probably assumed the
same thing.
Except I didn’t think twice. I sat up
and reached out, and as I did a small
blue lightning bolt lanced sharply out
of my reaching ﬁngertips into Jill’s
hand, hit, and clung. She straightened
and took an involuntary step back,
trailing a billow of dark smoke and a
gust of sulfur from her wrist; then the
cloud and the residual arcing sparks
slid off her hand and fell to the ﬂoor in
a messy clump.
“That stung,” she said in an accus-
ing voice, but I had reached the ﬂagon
of water and was indeed pouring it re-
freshingly over the top of my head.
“How did you ﬁnd me this time?” I
asked through the shower.
“It wasn’t very hard to pick up
your trail last night, yours and your

cronies’.”
I’d ﬁgured that much out for myself,
I just wanted to hold off the moment
when I’d have to engage in substantive
confrontation as long as possible. “It’s
good to know you can pick up a clue
when it’s thrown in your face, at least,”
I said.
Pink did begin to spread up Jill’s face
and across her cheeks, but the spoken
response came from the other side of
the bed. “You think you’re clever, don’t
you, you and that last bit of trickery in
Oolsmouth.”
“Not particularly,” I said.
“Only
by comparison, you could say.” The
pitcher empty, I was on a roll of sorts,
so I swung my legs over the edge of
the bed and used the momentum to
pull myself to my feet.
I’m not the
sort for dressing gowns, and after I’d
arrived back at the room last night or

this morning I’d had little choice but
to collapse still fully clothed.
These
were decisions that appeared particu-
larly fortuitous right at the moment.
Monoch had collapsed along with me,
too, which put him in my hand now as
well. If I only had a working brain I’d
be prepared for anything.
“I still want the ring,” Jardin contin-
ued. “It is clear, however, that you do
not have it, nor did your confederate in
Oolsmouth, the hapless Sapriel. I use
‘confederate’ here in the loosest sense
only, of course.”
“Of course,” I agreed. “I never said I
had the ring. I -”
He clearly wasn’t listening.
“What
was rather clever was how you let us
continue to draw our own conclusions,
adding very little of your own.
Your
other confederate - I now use the term
somewhat more precisely - was much

more a driving force than you, yourself,
if one goes back to analyze the ﬂow of
events.”
“To say that would be only fair,” I
acknowledged.
The question on the
table at the moment, after his last
statement, was whether he’d ﬁgured
out that that other confederate, whom
they’d known as Soaf Pasook, was re-
ally the god they thought was me, Jill’s
ex-or-current husband Gashanatantra.
“A certain amount of this one can
accept as the cost of doing business,”
Jardin stated.
“Eventually, however,
all bills must come due.”
I was ﬁnding it a little hard to keep
my full attention on what he was say-
ing, considering that Jill was doing her
best to probe me at the same time and
considering that taking into account
the effects of the toxic byproducts in
my system I didn’t seem to have very

much attention to spread around any-
how. “Must they?”
“Don’t start with that again,” Jill
snapped. “Don’t change the subject. If
-”
“Why not?” I inserted. “As you both
said, it’s not a topic that’s given any of
us any satisfaction this far. Why don’t
we just say our little partnership has
been dissolved and go back to our other
fun? Why -”
This time they weren’t the ones who
interrupted me.
You could say I in-
terrupted myself. I suddenly had the
strong sensation that someone was
looking over my shoulder. I had Jardin
and Jill both in view at the same time
as I edged back against the end table
and toward the wall, to keep them from
ﬂanking me, so the only thing behind
me should have been the wall, but of
course the walls in this room had so far

proven to be nothing more than decora-
tive cloaks for the passages and secret
doors that my assorted visitors had
been utilizing. The feeling was strong,
though - I could almost feel a breath
on the back of my neck. So I turned my
head rapidly for a quick scan.
There was nothing behind me ex-
cept wall. Unadorned wall, unbroken
by even a portrait with the chance of
mobile eyes.
Okay, so I was losing contact with
reality. I twisted back to face my visi-
tors again. As I did this, however, I re-
alized that the sensation of something
perched just behind my head had not
actually gone away. Was I imagining
it? That would be the logical explana-
tion; too much introspection and too lit-
tle sleep, and chemical stress on top of
it to boot.
But what if I wasn’t? Logic hadn’t

exactly ruled my life lately. Why would
it start now?
That was when it occurred to me
that perhaps my pounding head and
sluggish paths of thought were not due
totally to the previous night’s binge.
Jill was eyeing me strangely.
She
had her hand up gesturing toward me,
and I could feel the renewed force of
her probe somewhere out in front of
my chest where it was sliding off the
defenses I evidently now possessed.
Jardin too had a wary cast to his eye.
“What was that?” he said.
“You saw me out carousing,” I re-
minded him.
“Wastrels like me are
always jittery in the morning.
Don’t
you know it’s pretty crowded in here -
you want me to count the elephants?”
“Jardin,” Jill said uncertainly. “I’m
building a strange picture here.”
“I -”

“Shut up,” snapped Jardin.
“Tell
me.”
“That’s him,” said Jill, now openly
staring in my direction. “I mean, that’s
not him.
I mean that’s him, the one
we were with in Oolsmouth, but he’s
not who we thought he was. The sword
is the sword of my husband, but this
man who bears it is not. I mean, not
my husband.”
Jardin pursed his lips.
“Yes,” said
Jardin. “That is clear to me now. You
are not Gashanatantra. “
For myself, I felt like a butterﬂy on
a pin. Or a butterﬂy in the net, with
the pin descending toward it, when it
probably had a similar suspicion that
events were moving out of its control.
“I never said I was.”
“You lied to me,” Jardin said thought-
fully.
“If you are not Gashanatantra,
you have no deterrent capability.”

“That’s not entirely true,” I began.
“Actually, that’s not true at all.” This
would be a good time to tell him about
the metabolic link that let me draw on
Gash’s abilities and powers. “Gash -”
His hand was outstretched toward
me, and I was feeling the remote tingle
that meant he was doing his own inter-
rogation of my aura beyond my shield
or running some other kind of probe.
Perhaps he’d pick up the metabolic
link himself. I didn’t understand how
he was missing it, or Jill either for that
matter, except for that fact that my
experiences with Jardin hadn’t given
me a very high impression of his in-
telligence. “I see now,” he said. “That
wily scum Gashanatantra gave you a
disguise, didn’t he. That reckoning will
come, but it can wait. Now that he has
withdrawn his protection from you I
will deal with you ﬁrst. I can crush you

like a bug.” He clenched his ﬁst.
“In
fact, that bears every promise of being
a fulﬁlling exercise.”
“Now wait a minute,” I said.
Ob-
viously Jardin’s probing ability was
completely on the fritz at the moment;
on a par with his creativity in con-
versational metaphors.
Gash hadn’t
withdrawn the metabolic link at all.
I’d still been drawing knowledge and
skills from him ever since the last
time we’d met; what about that lit-
tle lightning bolt I’d zapped Jill with,
for example? Gash was just sneakier
than Jardin, that had to be the expla-
nation, not that it was any news, of
course.
Gash had been running plot
circles around everyone in sight since
our paths had crossed the ﬁrst time;
around me too, if the truth be told.
No, I still had Gash’s power at my ﬁn-
gertips and the front of my mind.
If

Jardin couldn’t see that and came after
me, the surprise he’d get would be -
But that’s just when he did ex-
actly that; come after me, that is.
A
force grabbed my arms and tried to
pull them out of my shoulder sockets,
grabbed each ﬁnger and tried to sepa-
rate them from my hands, grabbed my
legs, my teeth -
The pain was extreme. The attack
was also classic, aimed at making it
impossible to cast gesture- or speech-
based spells since the victim couldn’t
waggle his hands or control his vocal
chords.
Beside me, Monoch was still
upright, balanced on his walking-stick
tip, rapidly turning into a stalagmite
from the ice sheet forming around him;
that part was Jill’s casting, I could tell.
I tried to focus my mind and call on my
inner reserves ...
But I might have still been the most

surprised one in the room when the
bed lifted up off the ﬂoor, ﬂipped end-
over-end, and slammed squarely into
Jardin, carrying him over on his back
beneath the hurled mass of the board-
backed mattress and the heavy wooden
frame.
The sound of shattering glass ﬁlled
the air around me. I was free; I stag-
gered and almost fell, and I felt like
I’d just spent a long afternoon on the
rack under the care of a very diligent
operator, but I was free.
I cleared
my throat to propose something like
a truce, with a return to our earlier
standoff of armed neutrality, but what
emerged instead was a word that blis-
tered my lips as it passed and snapped
at my face like ten days staked out in
the high desert sun. Air curdling be-
hind it, the power word looped into the
overturned bed and burst into clinging

ﬂame.
A vortex appeared over the bed.
Loose things around the room ﬂung
themselves toward it - the water pitcher,
my folded towels, a basket of fruit I’d
picked up on the street for snacks. My
clothes lashing my body in the sud-
den gale, I felt myself being dragged
across the room too, and Jill, arms ﬂail-
ing, was trying to dig her heels into
the ﬂoorboards, but then the whole
ﬂaming bed took a hop off the ﬂoor,
twirled once, breaking apart, folded it-
self through the vortex, and vanished.
The vortex made a loud slurp, fell in
about itself, and followed the bed into
nothingness.
Jardin was lying on his back on the
smoldering ﬂoorboards covered with
soot. He looked up at me with a some-
what cockeyed expression. “The Spell
of Namelessness,” Jardin said dazedly.

“Why didn’t I feel it before?
But not
one of mine. You’re not Gashanatantra.
Who are you?”
I couldn’t recall doing anything to
bring this about,
but Monoch was
in my hand, ﬂaming and hoping for
lunch.
I had never appreciated be-
fore how complicated a construction
he was. Monoch wasn’t actually steel,
he was some sort of phase-changing
composite material with carbon ﬁbers
and diamond whiskers held in place
by a crystal matrix; that’s what al-
lowed spellwork to take place around
him without the inductive backlash
magical ﬁeld currents caused in con-
ductive metals.
This also allowed a
much higher level of bound-in energy
and -
Something gnawed at my forehead
and tried to chew its way into my brain.
It had materialized partway inside my

protection ﬁeld, courtesy of Jill, and
one scrabbling claw-appendage was
trying to hook its way into my eye. I
ﬂicked Monoch up and slashed across
my face, carving off a dangling chunk
of hair and a thin slice of integument
but dragging loose the construct as
well. It burst into ﬂame and fell into
ash, and as I readied my next offensive
stroke I -
I suddenly realized how strange this
whole thing was.
I was as aloof and
placid as if I’d been reading about
events in a book rather than being in
the middle of what looked to be a ﬁght
for my life. Even in a book you’d expect
to get more involved with what was
happening than I was here.
In fact,
even the fact that I was taking this
time to think about what I was doing
even while I was doing it was enough
to -

A counterattack was apparently un-
derway; my own. Whatever automatic
protection facilities I was inheriting
from Gash seemed to have the situa-
tion well in hand.
Why not sit back
and watch?
Why should I bother to
try to run things? I hadn’t succeeded
very well during those times in the
past when I’d done my best to exert
conscious control. Sure, I had volition,
I knew I did, but part of intelligence
is knowing when to stand aside out
of the way. So what if the aftereffects
of the evening’s brew left me feeling
sedated, as though I’d quaffed down
some potion of anxiety-suppression?
Who cared if time seemed to ﬂowing in
stops and starts? Who -
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I did.
At least, I should, anyway. I clenched
my jaw. The scene saw back into focus,
or my attention returned to focus on it,

I couldn’t tell which, and if my jaw was
still following its own agenda rather
than tightening up as I’d ordered I was
willing to ignore that for the moment
since I seemed nevertheless to be back
in some sort of control.
A patch of wall across the room was
steaming, but beneath the vapor the
surface had fused into something re-
ﬂective as silvered glass.
Some kind
of slime was dripping from the ceiling.
Jardin’s left arm was twisted awk-
wardly, as though it had tried to turn
into a tree but had decided to settle
with just breaking in a few strategic
places instead. Clouds of glowing and
whining things were whipping back
and forth through the air.
The ﬂoor
beneath my feet had also peeled par-
tially back, leaving me perched over
an open chasm on a narrow bridge of
wood. “There really is no need for this,”

I tried to say over the tumult.
What came out was slurred and
twisted, and would have been unrecog-
nizable I was sure if anyone else had
actually been able to hear it. The fact
that something had come out, though,
had to count as some sort of victory
for me.
But against whom?
Against
myself? I -
I was starting to slip back into that
same narcissistic reverie.
Again I
pushed it away.
This time I heard
someone else speaking. “Stop it, who-
ever you are!” Jill was yelling.
“Get
back!”
“Fine with me,” I said, but at the
same time I was spreading my arms
wide to hit them with some new send-
ing.
I could feel subroutines clicking
on and meshing together in their terri-
ble symmetry, and in a brief moment I
would understand what construct they

were building to -
Which
was
when
the
remaining
ﬂoor
underneath
me
disintegrated
completely and dropped me into the
pit.
It wasn’t a very deep pit, and the
opening wasn’t all that wide, either,
so my outstretched arms landing on
either edge kept me from falling com-
pletely into the earth.
When I saw
the large bureau grinding toward me
from the side wall, and after it the tall
free-standing closet cabinet, I started
to consider whether I might be better
off taking my chances with the earth
and rock caving in around my legs,
but then again someone seemed to
have that stuff under control even if
I wasn’t sure it was me. Through the
dust and smoke I could see a shaky
Jardin back on his feet, looking at me
with a frankly incredulous expression

on his battered face. He was muttering
something to himself under his breath,
and if anything more could surprise me
at the moment it would have been the
realization that I could actually sort of
hear what he was saying; something
about having to deal with some human
after all.
The wood in the bureau had been
aging and crumbling as the thing tum-
bled toward me, so the piece of furni-
ture that tottered onto my head then
wasn’t much more than a loose pile of
rotted sticks. The closet, however, had
shed less mass in its journey across the
ﬂoor. I actually felt the impact when
it smashed down on top of the chest
of drawers.
It didn’t break my arm,
although my arm did subside into the
long crack in the ﬂoor where the pro-
tection ﬁeld had transferred the force
of the blow, but it hurt when it hit and

it was clear the bruises would remind
me of it for days to come, too.
For that matter, I was abruptly real-
izing just how battered the rest of me
was, on top of the fact that all my en-
ergy seemed to have just drained out
of my feet into the earth. Whoever was
running the show had either knocked
off for the day or had come to the end
of their ability. Leaving me to clean up.
Me, all I felt like doing was going
back to sleep.
At the same time as I’d started feel-
ing exhausted and the pain started
creeping through, though, it occurred
to me that something else had changed.
I didn’t feel like an indifferent by-
stander anymore.
I was aghast at
the damage I’d helped to cause but
happy to be alive, amazed at the cool
expertise I’d shown but plenty worried
about the abandon I’d used in slinging

it around. It felt -
It felt like I’d just moved back from
another county into my own body. That
was ridiculous, of course.
As ridiculous as still feeling like
someone was sitting just behind me
looking over my shoulder.
Well, maybe Shaa had some ideas.
Or even Max. As my own strangeness
kept
mounting
I
was
getting
less
squeamish about consulting him for
advice.
The ﬁrst thing I had to do,
though, was dig myself out of the ﬂoor
and from under the debris.
Then I’d
probably have to vacate these rooms. I
tugged on my arm and got to work.
I could have called for help on what-
ever faculties had just waged battle on
my behalf, I suppose, but my ingrained
distrust of magic was resurfacing with
a large vengeance. Maybe I’d been call-
ing for help too much as it was. Maybe

that’s what was playing games with my
mind. Use of power can be addictive -
Just a second.
What about calling
for help? Where was the staff of this
place? Why wasn’t anyone banging on
the door to investigate what was after
all a signiﬁcant uproar? Did they just
ignore this kind of stuff here?
Well, it probably wasn’t unreason-
able if they did.
I hadn’t been too
distracted to notice Jardin and Jill
making their exit through the same
secret door Phlinn Arol had used, but
since they’d pulled part of the ceiling
down in front of that wall as they’d
left, that exit clearly wasn’t going to be
used again any time soon.
For what-
ever reason, no one was pounding at
the regular door either, but it could
only be a matter of moments. It might
be best if I wasn’t waiting whenever
they did decide to check up.

Especially since what did I really
know about the staff here? They were
beholden on some level to Phlinn Arol,
weren’t they? How had Jardin tracked
me down in the ﬁrst place? Peridol was
a big place and there were a lot of folks
out on the town – how had he gotten on
my trail? Had someone ﬁngered me?
What was Jardin’s relation to Phlinn
Arol?
I’d gotten free of the better part of
the debris now, and had squirmed my
lower body out of the dirt. If it wasn’t
my imagination I thought I’d dropped
weight since I’d woken up, too; maybe
as much as ﬁve pounds I hadn’t partic-
ularly wanted to lose. Since I needed
food and needed sleep and wasn’t sure
which was more urgent, it was just as
well I’d lost weight, I suppose; that
way I didn’t have to consider whether I
might be pregnant. Instead -

“It is almost time,” I told myself.
Wait a minute. Time for what? Why
would I think something like that, and
in such a forbidding tone, too? Was it
another one of those dreams, except
sneaking up on me in a waking mo-
ment rather than while I was asleep?
Could it have been Gash, speaking to
me directly through the metabolic link?
Or perhaps Monoch?
I thought I heard myself chuckling
at myself. That was ridiculous too; of
course it was ridiculous; I knew it was
ridiculous. So why was I still hearing
it? Gray was creeping across my vision.
Gray, fading to black, fading to that
mist I’d seen in my dreams.

Chapter22
DAMN,
DAMN,
DAMN.
DAMN!
There was no question what had hap-
pened.
It had the inexorable logic of
a bad dream.
Max understood that
not everyone’s dreams were logical, be-
ing characterized by a singular lack of
causality and a distinct loss of contact
with reality, but that had never been
his own habit. He did dream, of course,
but his own dreams typically unfolded
like the operation of clockwork, or at

least that was how the progression
appeared to him (as spectator or par-
ticipant) at the time. Events occurred
in sequence, plots unreeled, mysteries
unraveled; indeed, Max often thought
he got some of his best thinking done
while he was asleep.
Every so often, though, a dream
would go sour.
That was unpleasant.
Seeing a sequence begin to proceed
down the wrong road, foreseeing how
things would continue as they went
from bad to worse, being powerless
to do anything but watch, or more
annoyingly yet, be caught up by the
inexorable gears of a grinding fate –
that was unpleasant.
And that was
what was happening now.
Except he
wasn’t watching, he was involved. And
it was a very bad dream.
Except
he
wasn’t
asleep,
either.
Without question he was awake; there

was nothing vicarious about it.
For
that matter, he could never have as-
sembled such a mess in his sleep. No,
he’d had to roll up his sleeves and work
at it.
Come to think of it, he hadn’t been
dreaming lately, or at least not in the
lucid manner he could recollect upon
regaining consciousness.
Was that
his subconscious’s way of washing its
hands of the whole matter, of trying to
tell him he was headed this time for
serious problems?
No, it couldn’t have been. This plot
was no more risky or convoluted than
any number of exercises he’d run in the
past. Things had just gone wrong, that
was all.
The die had fallen against
him, random chance was sour today,
fate had intervened; you could pick
your metaphor of choice.
On the other hand, a critic might

say this only proved he’d been unrea-
sonably lucky this far.
The critic might also say he was re-
treating from the problem at hand to
indulge in useless philosophizing. Phi-
losophizing, as always, wouldn’t solve
a thing, and there were things that
had to be solved. Or addressed, any-
way. The leading one at the moment
was Leen.
He could tell what had happened. In
her hurry to get to her social obligation
Leen had rushed out of the Archives,
forgetting about Robin. She had exited
through the Front Door, Max had felt
her transit quite clearly. This had also
been borne out by events, in particular
by the ease of his own passage through
the Back Door path disguised as Leen.
Once he was already inside, though,
Leen had remembered Robin.
Being
the responsible person she obviously

was, she’d resolved to go back in af-
ter him.
The problem was that the
path guardians knew she was already
inside.
The guardians weren’t particularly
intelligent but they weren’t exactly
dumb, either. They knew there should
only be one Leen, and that if that
Leen had gone inside the Archives she
couldn’t go inside again until she’d
gone out ﬁrst. But when she showed
up again they’d recognized her. Being
the original, she’d probably been more
recognizable than had the disguised
Max. She’d known what she was doing,
too. So the guardians had allowed her
to start down the path.
But that hadn’t solved the problem.
There were still two Leens apparently
roaming the vicinity. The guardian sys-
tems had surely wafﬂed back and forth
trying to decide what to do.
Finally,

though, they had obviously fallen back
on an underlying principle: when in
doubt, immobilize.
That would allow
the guardians to wait, and hope that
perhaps an answer would present it-
self.
So Leen was out there, frozen, wait-
ing for the guard systems to make up
their mind, which they would now be
in no particular hurry to do.
In the-
ory that was ﬁne; Max could ﬁnish
his business and depart at his leisure.
Or ﬁnish his business, anyway.
He
wouldn’t be able to leave for the same
reason Leen couldn’t ﬁnish entering:
he was the other Leen that had caused
the problem.
If he tried to set foot
on the recessional path the guardians
would put him on ice, too. Once they
had the two of them on hand for com-
parison, they might be able to reach
a decision after all. Max had a nasty

suspicion who’d be the loser in that
process.
After all, he knew who the
real Leen was. Most likely the guard
systems would too.
Of course, Max had tried to look
more like Leen than Leen herself...
But the fact that remained was that
one of them would end up on the short
end, liable for immediate eradication
in some traditional manner.
Unless
the guards decided the best thing to
do was just wipe the slate across the
board, and got rid of them both.
He could wait; maybe the guards
would break their deadlock on their
own. Either they’d let Leen through, or
they wouldn’t. If they got rid of Leen
that would solve things, sure enough.
Unless it wouldn’t. Damn! Was he
really ready to sacriﬁce Leen?
Was
he prepared to even risk it?
And he
couldn’t wait, either.
The guard sys-

tems were getting old, which meant
they weren’t necessarily stable. They
could slip up, through inattention, or
malfunction, or sheer crotchetiness -
and any of those could convert a tem-
porarily immobilization into perma-
nence.
Perhaps he could outwit the guardian
to make his own escape. But could he
abandon Leen?
And Robin, for that
matter?
Could he sacriﬁce another bystander,
whomever they were?
If Roni found out, she’d never forgive
him, Worse, she’d never let him forget
it.
“Mister?” It was Robin.
No doubt
wondering why Max had suddenly
turned into a statue in the middle of
their conversation.
“Excuse me,” Max said to Robin.
“We’ll talk later. I just thought of some-

thing I have to do.”
“Okay,” said Robin.
“See you later.
Bye.”
“Bye,” said Max.
He eased the
door shut and then took off down the
aisle.
The Front Door terminus was
ahead. Could he just bludgeon his way
through?
No, it would never work;
even the second quantum level force
levels he could bring to bear would
never overpower the Archives’ genera-
tors. Creeley had wanted to keep out
gods just as much as he’d wanted to
keep out ordinary people.
If not at
least as much. Finesse was what was
indicated here. In fact -
You gotta pay attention, Max mut-
tered to himself. This would be tricky,
extremely tricky. But what was exper-
tise for, if not to face challenges?
Sure, Max thought. Right.
This was certainly a ﬁne mess. As

much as Leen hadn’t wanted to attend
the luncheon, it was paradoxical how
annoyed she now found herself at being
delayed in getting there. And Robin -
well, Robin.
Which of course was all just a way of
not thinking about the real situation.
Physically it was clearly a lost cause.
The guardians were a lot stronger than
she was, and they didn’t have to eat.
Mentally, she wasn’t having any better
luck. The guard systems were refusing
to listen to her, and they weren’t leav-
ing themselves open to her attempts
to worm into their mechanisms to run
diagnostics or overrides either. What
could have gone wrong with them?
Maybe that was the wrong ques-
tion to ask. What if nothing had gone
wrong?
What situation could have
caused them to respond as they were
currently doing? What-

Hmm.
If it hadn’t been for that story her
brother had told her, she wouldn’t even
consider the possibility.
But if you
accepted the idea that someone could
have gained entrance into the Archives
once before, and proceeded to ask how,
then, well, perhaps ... but it also meant
that the intruder was still inside the
Archives. With Robin.
Leen clenched her teeth and probed
again. Again nothing ... but no, wait.
Something was different. Fields were
ﬂuxing, force lines circulating.
She
was being probed again, too. Probed by
what from the backscatter appeared
to be a very confused set of guardians.
Creeley hadn’t designed the guard sys-
tems to be verbal, unfortunately, which
made it difﬁcult to interrogate them,
not to mention virtually impossible for
them to ask for guidance. They never

had asked for anything of the sort be-
fore, but that only made it all the more
surprising to begin to suspect that
they wouldn’t at all mind an appropri-
ate contribution from her now. “Why
don’t you show me what the problem
is?” she emoted.
And then she was free.
It was as
simple as that, which of course meant
that it could scarcely be that simple
at all, or in other words some juxta-
position of events had occurred into
which her message had slid, possi-
bly tilting a balance one way rather
than another. She wasn’t free, actually,
merely remobilized, released from the
web to continue her inward traverse.
Not only free, either; she was being
actively urged onward, as though the
guardians had placed a wind at her
back.
There had been another presence

on the door path recently, she realized,
and that presence was now back. She
could feel it ahead and below, or wher-
ever the geometry of the inner end of
the path really translated into.
Not
only another presence. It was another
...
her?
She’d been right, then.
But
what had happened?
Anyone tricky
enough to sneak into the Archives
by impersonating her probably knew
more about the workings of the guard
systems than she did, herself. They’d
have had to be monitoring her own
comings and goings, too, to perfect
their own timing. So they must have
known that she had reentered the path
and become stuck.
If they’d known,
though, why had they revealed them-
selves? They had to know that faced
with a head-to-head choice between
the two of them, the systems would
recognize her as the original.
There

was one possible reason ...
But that couldn’t be right.
Why
would whomever-they-were go to so
much trouble to sneak around, and
then throw it all away merely to rescue
her? It didn’t make sense.
Which might have been what the
guardians thought, too.
Why they
wanted her advice.
There had been another presence -
but all of a sudden there wasn’t, any
more. The intruder had now entered
the Front Door path, showing them-
selves at least through the antecham-
ber and even into the Watermark’s
eddy-point, the Stain.
The intruder
had entered, made sure the guardians
had had a full chance to probe her or it,
and then ... vanished. Leen had almost
reached the Watermark herself, that
was obviously how she was now able
to feel the situation so clearly. The rip-

ples of the intruder’s escapades were
still washing back and forth.
When one was traversing the Archive
paths, there was a tendency to rely pri-
marily on the inner eye.
So many of
the cues and dangers were not directly
visualizable, so many sights were mere
tricks of perception, that something as
mundane as eye-vision could lead one
more into hazard than towards help.
The partial trance-state that was the
traditional tool of the Archivist also
fostered a mode of neglect of exterior
phenomena.
This wasn’t accidental,
but then what was?
It was clear to
the initiate that the guard systems
themselves functioned on the same in-
ner level, having rudimentary or no
capabilities of sight themselves.
Maybe what they wanted now were
her eyes.
The Watermark was a mid-air mael-

strom, a ball of whipping vapor so
tangled it might as well have been
a rather confused waterspout or an
errant ﬂoating pond. The usual traver-
sal trick involved the use of its lashing
wind as a crack-the-whip boost to spin
yourself around and past it. The Stain
surrounding the Watermark on the
jagged ﬂoor-path usually had the ap-
pearance of a shoreline trough after a
passing tidal surge or ﬂood wave, being
strewn with kelp and other seaweeds,
sucking sands, an occasional lashing
ﬂounder, and residual pools of salt wa-
ter. None of these things were actually
there, of course, which only served to
bear out the distinction between the
perceptions of outer and inner eyes.
The guardians (and Creeley before
them) had been big on verisimilitude.
As she neared the Watermark now
herself, nothing appeared out of place.

The
churning
water-wind
or
wind-
water,
the ﬂotsam,
the force that
tugged at her clothes and wanted to
spin her around the room, all were
as they usually were. There were no
residual energy clouds, no soot stains
on the rocks; there was no hint that
someone had discovered the perma-
nently elusive secret of teleportation.
Yet someone had been here, very re-
cently.
Or had they?
Could it have
been a sending, a red-herring decoy?
No, the guardians were quite certain.
So where had the intruder gone,
then?
Oh. Of course. Leen planted her feet
and stopped, secure in the knowledge
that the guardians were giving her
quite a lot of leeway at the moment;
she should have no problem getting
started again. “You might as well come
out,” she yelled over the Watermark’s

howl. “I know you’re in there.”
There was no ripple in the ﬁeld
lines, none of the usual indications
that someone with an active aura was
present or passing through. But some-
thing was still out of place, something
moving - a darkness beneath the sur-
face of the Watermark, that was it,
something physical spinning and tum-
bling in the midst of the winds, some-
thing heaving at the agitated surface
-
Something popping free of the Wa-
termark and tottering and toppling to
splash squarely into one of the larger
puddles on the path. Something? - no,
a person, completely garbed in form-
ﬁtting black,
now considerably the
worse for wear through close acquain-
tance with the Watermark’s core. The
person wasn’t dead, though, he was
spinning to his feet with surprising

control and grace for one who must
have been bruised and pummeled to
an extreme, spinning ﬁrst to his feet
and then around to face her.
“Hello there,” said Max.
He was trying to brace himself.
It
was proving to be the hardest thing
he’d done all day, harder by far than
merely traversing the path.
That
damned Watermark had been no fun
at all - his ears were still howling and
his balance was shot, and his body felt
like he’d just been rolled down a tall
mountain and off a cliff into a cataract
trapped in a poorly cushioned barrel;
he would know.
But when you got
right down to it, the episode had been
primarily physical, and in any case he
hadn’t gone into this expecting a picnic.
If his stay in the Watermark had been
the nastiest thing he’d had to deal with,
in fact, there would have been no ques-

tion that he’d gotten off easily. Instead,
on top of the Watermark he was facing
... well, what he was facing.
It had been worth a try. If she hadn’t
realized what was happening, as she
obviously had, Leen might have contin-
ued straight on through to the end of
the path without detecting him.
She
might have written the affair off as a
malfunction. He hadn’t expected that,
but it had been worth a try. He hadn’t
even been certain that collapsing the
Leen-aura and trying to shift his em-
anations immediately to the proﬁle of
something on the order of magnitude
of a ﬂy would succeed in dropping him
below the guard systems’ threshold of
detection.
That had worked, anyway.
He’d had to use the cloaking effect of
the Watermark to help, though, and
whether he would have been able to
continue to use stealth to make his

way out of the Watermark and then
out of the maze had been even more
hypothetical.
It looked as though it
would stay that way, too.
“Hello,” Leen said. “Nice to see you
again.”
“Is it?” said Max.
“Why not?” she said, folding her
arms. “Last time all you seemed able
to think about was seeing me again,
or at least that’s what you said, so I’d
suppose you’ll be happy you’ve gotten
your wish.”
“You must be right, of course,” said
Max, trying not to scowl. “I wouldn’t
lie about a thing like that.”
“Wouldn’t you?” Leen stated.
“I
wouldn’t know.”
“I doubt that saying ‘take my word
for it’ would have much of an impact.”
“Actions speak louder.”
“So they say,” agreed Max. “But ac-

tions themselves are subject to inter-
pretation.”
“I suppose they are. Also to tests of
plausibility, and while we’re at it we
might as well throw in veracity too,
wouldn’t you say?”
“A slippery topic, or at least it has a
tendency in that direction, but you’re
certainly right there again too.
Your
nephew is perfectly safe and happy, by
the way.”
“No other possibility ever crossed my
mind,” said Leen.
“You’re going to be late to your lun-
cheon. I’m sorry if I’m helping to delay
you.”
“I’m sure there will be other lun-
cheons,” Leen said. “Since you’re keep-
ing such a close eye on my calendar
perhaps you can schedule me for one.
Unless people get fed up one time too
many and stop inviting me, so I sup-

pose there’s a chance some good will
come of this yet.”
“It might be easier to hold a discus-
sion if we moved out of this area,” Max
suggested. “This wind howling in my
ear makes it hard to think, not to men-
tion having to shout.”
Leen regarded him.
“On the other
hand, it might be just as well to stay
right here.
I rather think the guard
systems are waiting for me to help
them with a decision about you. Right
at the moment they might take move-
ment on your part the wrong way.”
“It’s your call,” Max said, forcing a
shrug. “It’s your turf.”
“Is it?”
“Could you ever doubt it?”
“‘Doubt’ is as good a word as any, I
suppose.”
Max cleared his throat.
“This has
turned into a messy business,” he mut-

tered. “I’ve always hated messes; it’s al-
ways a lot harder to clean them up and
put things back in order than if you
hadn’t messed up in the ﬁrst place.”
“That’s the truth, at least, but it
doesn’t mean it isn’t worth a try.”
Max sighed and cleared his throat
again.
“My ﬁrst problem was trying
to mix business with - well, something
that wasn’t business.
No, that’s not
true. The real problem was ...”
Leen gave him a moment.
“Was
what?” she prodded.
“Letting
myself
forget
the
main
rule,” Max said disgustedly.
“Being
weak enough to think I could get in-
volved in anything that wouldn’t come
back and bite me.”
“Such as?”
Max looked away.
“You probably
won’t believe anything I say, but I like
you, fool that I am. A lot. It’s weak

of me, but I do.
It’s also not smart.
Every time I, uh, start to like someone,
something nasty ends up happening.”
“One of those messes you mentioned,
I suppose. But a mess isn’t the end of
the world, or at least it isn’t to most
people. Is it a reason to stop trying?”
“Isn’t it?” Max growled something
under his breath that even he was glad
he couldn’t hear.
“If only you didn’t
turn out to be the Archivist. I needed
to get into the Archives and this trick
was the best way to do it.”
“A proven way, too.
You picked up
that amulet around your neck when
you were doing your ‘trick’ with my
grandfather.”
Max met her eyes for a moment,
then glanced back at the Watermark
again. “I was more rambunctious when
I was younger.”
“From the look of things you’re still

proﬁcient. Your technique’s not bad.”
“Only my luck is sour.”
“Not only your luck,” Leen told him.
“One could question your judgment.
Didn’t it occur to you to ask me for
my help? That might have avoided a
fair amount of deceit and at least some
sneaking around.”
Max opened his mouth, but when no
sound emerged he closed it again.
“With the time the Back Door tra-
verse must have taken you,” Leen said
thoughtfully, “you couldn’t have been
inside the Archives for more than a
minute or two, so you couldn’t possibly
have accomplished whatever you’d set
out to do there.”
“I seem to have accomplished things
I didn’t set out to do instead,” Max mut-
tered, “things I’d rather I’d never have
started.”
“I don’t know,” said Leen. “That may

remain to be seen. Are you after the
same goals as the Scapula?”
“I’m sure I’m not.
Whatever they
are.”
“Don’t you know?”
“Aside from the obvious?” Max said.
“Arznaak wants to rise as far and as
fast as he can, getting whatever he
wants to along the way and stepping
on as many other people as possible,
starting with his family. Beyond that?
More speciﬁcally?
Your guess is as
good as mine. I hope you don’t think
I’m like him,” he added.
“The Scapula seems to specialize in
making people nervous,” commented
Leen.
“You seem better at making
them aggravated.”
“You’re not the ﬁrst one to say that.
Arznaak makes me nervous, all right.
Especially when I don’t know what he’s
up to.”

“Yes, well, you’re not the only one
around with that point of view.” What
would her brother do with this situa-
tion? Leave Max to his fate or string
him along? “How much do you know
about the Archives?”
“Not as much as I’d like to.”
“Your immediate reﬂex is to be eva-
sive, do you know that? That’s a habit
you might want to try to ﬁght.”
To Leen’s satisfaction, Max looked
thoroughly
disgruntled.
Then
he
seemed to change his mind about
something.
“I know about Creeley,
of course,” he said. “I’ve read some of
his stuff.”
“Creeley?
Not the lost papers?”
Darn, it had come out before she’d
even had a chance to think.
“Nothing’s lost if you know the right
place to look,” Max said. “I may be able
to get hold of them for you, but any-

way I remember most of the interesting
stuff. Let’s see, I know about -”
“What do you know about the foun-
dation of the Archives?” Leen inter-
rupted.
Max’s response was a slow,
calculating,
speculative glance from
beneath an upraised eyebrow. Uh, oh,
Leen thought. I may have overstepped
on that one. “How much does anyone
know about that?” he said.
Leen paused.
She was thinking
about motivation. Not just anyone off
the street would want to get into the
Archives. Even if they knew the real
Archives existed, which you could say
about few enough people in the ﬁrst
place. What was really going on here?
What was he after?
Well, she hadn’t exactly asked him.
So she did.
To his own surprise, Max found him-
self telling her. Not everything - more

than he expected, certainly, but not
the details of his current scheme - al-
though Leen was enough of an outsider
that he might actually be able to tell
her that too and maybe get some use-
ful comments in return; still, he was
spouting enough to -
“You are right, there,” Leen said.
“There is Archival material on some
of the gods, and possibly even some
vulnerability data, too.”
It was clear to Max that he was out
of his element. What had he been talk-
ing about? What kind of spell was he
under here? Finding material on the
gods, of course, right. “I’m particularly
looking for loopholes or weaknesses
I can exploit,” added Max.
“At the
moment concerning this one in partic-
ular.”
“I stand a better chance of ﬁnding
it quickly than you would, blundering

around without knowing where any-
thing is ... unless you do know where
things are, I suppose.”
“Not the way you do, I’m sure.”
Leen regarded him.
“I don’t know
about you, I think you should know
that. I don’t know whether - well, let’s
just say I don’t know.
But whatever
you’re really doing here, whether I
trust you or not, there’s something
you still may be able to help me with.
What’s a little subterfuge between
friends, I guess?” Leen shook her head,
more to clear it than for effect. Stop lol-
lygagging, she thought. “Look, you’re
an antiquarian, a technologist, an arti-
fact specialist, right?”
“I try.”
“Okay, then. I want you to look at
something.” She had already started
moving again on the path. “Well, come
on. What are you waiting for?”

This is not what I expected, Max was
thinking.
He didn’t know what he’d
expected, not really, but this certainly
wasn’t it.
When you’re used to inter-
personal
relationships
characterized
by distrust and stabbing in the back
you -
“Come on. Or would you prefer me
to feed you to the guardians right now,
instead of only potentially later?”
The guardians were clearly with-
holding their own ﬁnal judgment too,
but as Max launched himself again
into motion as well he could feel their
willingness to follow Leen’s lead, at
least for the moment. With Leen blaz-
ing the trail and the guard systems
contenting themselves with an occa-
sional querulous jab to remind him
who was really in charge, the short
trip back to the Archival terminus was
the easiest of the several passages he’d

experienced. Max knew that was just
as well. Between the pummeling from
the Watermark and his equally unbal-
ancing encounter with Leen he was not
exactly at his prime.
Once through the door, Leen made
the expected beeline to check on Robin.
Max was lagging behind. “What’s the
matter now?” Leen said.
“Afraid of
what I’ll ﬁnd?”
“Of course I’m not afraid what you’ll
ﬁnd,” Max growled.
“I’m not fond of
kids, that’s all.”
Leen now had the door to Robin’s
room open. “You can’t hate Robin,” she
said, smiling at the occupant. “Look at
him - you can’t hate him.”
“Is the man in the funny black suit
still there?” Robin said.
“Come on,” Leen ordered, “say hello
to Robin.”
“Yes,” Max said under his breath, so

that Leen wasn’t quite sure he was ac-
tually speaking, “I do. Especially right
at the moment.” Then, in his full voice,
Max said with convincing sincerity, “Hi
there, Robin. How you doing?”
“I think he likes you,” Leen told Max
as they retreated into the Archives
a few moments later, leaving Robin
again to his pursuits.
“I guess that’s a good start,” Max
said. “Isn’t it? Or maybe it’s a question
of whether Robin’s judgment becomes
a generalized response.”
“You want to wedge your own foot
deeper down your throat, be my guest.
Turn here.”
Max, continuing to trail Leen, pulled
off his eye-slit mask and stuffed it
roughly in one oversized pocket. This
was certainly not the sort of situation
where he’d ever imagined he could
even be entertaining the question of

whether he might have met his match.
He –
What was Leen doing, down on her
knees in front of that bookcase?
Oh. Oh! “You found this?” Max said.
“Yes. No; actually Robin found it.”
“I thought he showed potential,”
Max muttered. “It’s not a trap.”
“Is that a question or -”
“It was a gratuitous remark,” he
said, moving slowly down the tight
circular stair. “Sometimes I think out
loud... Obviously you’ve been through
here, you’ve cleaned the place up, if
there’d been a trap you would have
... look at this, look at this.” Max ap-
proached the alloy wall and the thick
dark window. “A metal detector would
go berserk in here.
You tried probes
and got nothing?”
“Nothing,” Leen said.
She had
seated herself a half-turn above him

on the staircase and was watching him
prowl the compact room. “Seems like a
total null, a blank. Such as what you
tried to pull on the guardians and me.”
“So you’re hoping it’ll take one to
know one? Well, could be. What did
this glass panel look like when you
ﬁrst broke in here?”
“Like it does now, except dustier.”
Max had his face scrunched up
against the panel in question,
ap-
parently to bring his eye as close to
the surface as possible.
“If you want
my ideas,” he said, in a mufﬂed voice,
“you’d be better off telling me what-
ever you can. There were lights, right?
Little round glowing lights?”
“How did you - you weren’t in here
the other time you broke -”
“Hold on a second, hold on. I heard
about one of these things once, that’s
all.”

“There’s another one of these some-
where?”
“That would seem to be the case,”
Max stated. “You hear stories like this,
you have to ﬁgure they’re a myth, ex-
cept sometimes they’re not. This other
one was supposed to be in the tower
of one of the gods.
There’s so much
garbage out there about the gods, I
ﬁgured, well, who cares anyway, right?
It’s not like I was planning to burgle
another god, especially one who was
probably mythical himself.”
Another? thought Leen. “Who was
this other mythical god?”
Max stood back and considered the
wall. “Now that I think about it, that
story might be making more and more
sense after all. This is Dislocation stuff,
you realize that.”
“Of course.”
“And according to the stories, Byron

was the one who caused the Dislocation
and the birth of the gods in the ﬁrst
place.”
It was just as well she was sitting
down. “Byron?”
“You haven’t heard of him?
Byron
the Artiﬁcer?”
“What do you know about him?”
Max shrugged.
“How much does
anyone know? He was the father of the
gods in some allegorical way, created
the magic that overthrew technology,
turned against his creations and was
swallowed up by them.
How mythi-
cal can you get? No real person could
be that much of an archetype. Likely
there was a real Byron and he just had
a lot of creation legends hung on him,
who knows?
But this thing’s no leg-
end, sure enough.” Then Max started
spouting gibberish.
Leen jerked upright.
Was there a

curse after all, and had it just stricken
Max?
But suddenly, as abruptly as
he’d begun Max had fallen silent. “Are
you all right? What was that?”
“I’m trying to remember what ex-
tinct language Byron might have used,”
Max said, his hands on his hips and
a glare on his face toward the wall.
“Drooze ya?” he demanded of the wall.
“No, huh?”
“You actually speak pre-Dislocation
languages?”
“What good is grubbing around in
the past if you can’t understand what
you ﬁnd? My accent’s probably wrong,
though. The only folks around who re-
ally know the right pronunciation are
the gods, and of course they’re not talk-
ing.” He said something else bizarre to
the wall.
“You don’t think something might
really be listening to you, do you?” But

she was the one who’d ﬁrst thought
that something was alive back there,
so why not?
“It’s worth a - what’s this?”
A small green disc of light had ap-
peared at the upper left corner of the
dark glass slab and somewhere in its
interior. It was slowly blinking - on, off,
on, off.
“What did you say to it?” Leen asked,
with no little amazement.
“‘Hello,’ I think.
Good morning,
something like that.
Let’s try this.”
Max spoke another phrase, a longer
one this time, from the sound of it in
the same language.
The green dot hesitated, stopped
blinking, disappeared; then suddenly
it had leapt back to life and was rac-
ing across the panel, leaving letters
glowing in its wake. That was the only
thing they could be, letters. Only what

did they -
“The hell you say,” Max sputtered,
squinting at the display. “Goddamned
oracle.”
“What?” said Leen.
Max scowled at the green scrawl.
“The worthless thing’s being cryptic. I
asked it what it had to tell us but it’s
gone into some kind of riddle mode. Ei-
ther that or it just likes non sequiturs.
‘If it’s advanced enough you can’t tell
technology from magic,’ what am I
supposed to say to that?”
“Huh?”
“Yeah,” said Max. “I - oh, great. Now
it’s gone away.”
The letters had vanished again, leav-
ing the blinking green dot. “That’s it?
That’s all?”
But apparently it was. Though Max
cajoled it for the next ﬁfteen minutes,
the thing now totally ignored him;

whatever riddle-answer it had been
expecting it had obviously failed to re-
ceive. Max cast an eye back at Leen.
He would have to trust her to do his re-
search for him. He certainly hadn’t ac-
complished his mission in the Archives
and it was already getting to be time
to go.
He had his appointment with
his contact from the Inauguration Ball,
to get the god’s answer to the proposal
Max had made. It was a tricky enough
gambit, already, without running the
risk of being late as well.
But if the
god did accept the deal, that’s when
Max would need the insight the re-
search should provide, and he’d need
it pretty damn fast.
“Let me explain
some more about what I’m trying to
do,” Max began.

Chapter23
ONE CERTAINLY HAD TO GIVE
CREDIT where credit was due. Max-
imillian the Vaguely Disreputable, in
the course of his career, had managed
to run afoul of quite an impressive list
of talents.
It was really quite neigh-
borly of him, Fradjikan thought.
It
had made it so convenient to recruit
forces for his own plan. Not every ma-
jor job gave one the luxury to pick and
choose.

Not that any of those he’d recruited
were up to his own level, of course.
There was the Scapula, whose precise
level remained to be determined but
was certainly high.
Fradi hadn’t ex-
actly recruited the Scapula himself,
however; there had been some amount
of solicitation on each side.
That
clearly had planted the roots of the
current situation, with its questions
and uncertainties.
Which was not to
say that the Scapula’s additions and
modiﬁcations to the plan weren’t well-
chosen, and rather clever too, in the
sneakily underhanded manner that
gave the best plans their revelatory
character.
Still, the Scapula’s moti-
vations and ultimate goals remained
cryptic. There wasn’t anything partic-
ularly wrong with that, either, since
Fradjikan
obviously
was
facilitator
and not target, but it was always bet-

ter to be on the safe side.
Safety, as
always, rested with greater knowledge.
He would just have to keep his eyes -
“Is that it?”
Fradjikan recollected himself smoothl
from his brief reverie. Standing across
from him next to the refreshments he’d
set out in the dayroom were the three
other participants in this ﬁnal prepara-
tory meeting. “That is the plan,” Fradi
restated.
“You’re sure he’ll be in the right
place?”
“He will be there,” Fradi assured
them. “There will undoubtedly be some
last-minute improvising required, but
that is what distinguishes profession-
als such as yourselves from the rabble,
does it not?”
The man stroked his curled black
beard with the hand that was not hold-
ing a goblet, then ran it through the

rakishly wild hair over his forehead.
“Max can be a pretty slippery guy,” he
remarked.
“It’s never been an easy
matter keeping him in sight.
He’s
always changing himself around and
climbing up on roofs and letting off
decoys, who knows what-all.”
“It’s about time somebody turned
that against him, too,” said the robed
fellow at his side. His own head was
shaved clean, except for a residual
fringe that ran in a circle above his
ears. “You’ve done a solid job, I’ll give
you that. Using Kalifa and Ma Pitom
to keep the pressure on - and us, too - I
bet Max doesn’t know if he’s coming or
going.”
“Never hinge an operation on a bet,”
the third man said darkly, glowering at
the titles on the bookcase.
The ﬁrst one eyed him with an ex-
pression of some surprise. “You’re aw-

ful talkative today, Romm. You got a
problem?”
Romm V’Nisa turned to face them,
his arms folded across his chest. “Max-
imillian is always a problem,” he in-
toned. Then he added, “Problems are
my job.”
“If there weren’t problems to solve
we’d all be out of a job,” said the man
in the robe. “Max has always been so
suspicious it’s been hard to pull any-
thing on him; show him a picture of
a bed and he’ll think somebody with a
dagger’s gonna jump out from under it
at him. The idea of playing to his sus-
picions by burying him up to his eye-
brows in plots was a master stroke. All
these traps, menaces, ambushes falling
on him from every which-way, and then
the subversion of the irredentists, and
linking Max to them with that scandal-
poster campaign, well, it’s -”

Romm grunted.
“Were you raised
by magpies? If you compromise opera-
tional security with your chatter I will
ﬁnally cut out your tongue.”
Their leader sighed. “Is there some
particular detail you still want to dis-
cuss, Romm? I’m satisﬁed that Senor
Ballista’s plan is as solid as we can ask
for.”
“As you say,” Romm told him in a
dour tone.
Were they deliberately trying to but-
ter him up? If he was in their place he
might do the same. After all, they had
to suspect there was more to the plot
than had been shared with them; this
was a reasonably nonconfrontational
probing gambit to see what other infor-
mation they might easily glean. Chas
V’Halila, the talkative one, had just
stated more than they’d ofﬁcially been
told, subtly underlining their own ca-

pabilities and resources while at the
same time seeming to praise Fradi,
himself.
They clearly understood the
role of the smokescreen in shielding
the central thrust...
It was most likely just habit.
An
endemic symptom of plotters was their
desire to understand the full scope
of a scheme in which they might be
merely supporting players.
“Just be
certain you wait for the signal,” Fradi
reminded them. The most complicated
element here - and consequently the
one most worth worrying about - was
the sequencing of events.
“Shall we maintain our guard de-
tail?” Gadol, the leader, ventured.
“Why not?” said Fradi. “It gives your
people practice.”
“Just so,” agreed Gadol.
Casting a
last reluctant glance at it, he set down
his glass. “Well, I suppose we should

check in with the civic authorities. Es-
pecially since we’re ofﬁcially under
their command.”
“We’ve never worked for this branch
of Peridol before,” Chas reminded him.
“If we play things off right we could be
in for some serious long-term employ-
ment.
Replenish the coffers and all
that.”
“It is possible that we might have oc-
casion to work together in the future as
well,” suggested Fradjikan. “One does
not come across a resource such as the
Hand every day.”
On that note of mutual congratula-
tion, the threesome departed. Things
had been developing remarkably well,
and at a lively pace.
When mapping
things out originally, there had been an
outside chance that events would move
rapidly enough to stage this denoue-
ment at the Running of the Squids;

he had hoped, but it had still been no
better than a toss-up.
It was indeed
gratifying that this would now be the
case.
The appropriate canvas would
set this act off with that extra ﬂair of
memorability.
There was still the issue of his pa-
tron. At least he had been able to pro-
gram in some insurance. Not as much
as he liked, granted, but it should
be enough.
And then there was the
Scapula ...
Perhaps Fradi should have lined up
more insurance against him, too. Well,
at this stage it couldn’t be helped. His
greatest hedge was that of nonthreat-
ening future utility. Although...
What about that woman, the librar-
ian? She had obviously become to the
Scapula a thorn.
Perhaps there was
some move to be played there. Yes, per-
haps there was.

On that other hand, there was a
danger of overbooking.
Fradi was al-
ready up to his neck managing his
female-related intrigues. Did he want
to add another?
Some thought was
called for here.
Perhaps it would be
better to ride with events; a target of
opportunity might present itself.
Thinking of events, what time was
it? Oh! - later than he’d expected. It
was time to be out and about. Plots or
no plots, one had to keep one’s hand in.

Chapter24
“YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR EARS
OPEN to what these sects are talking
about,” Max had admitted.
“Some-
times they get on to something.” So
here Jurtan was with these loonies.
It was turning out to be a waste of
a good day. He could be out jamming
with the Underlings or checking out
one of the other clubs the guys had
told him about, or practicing on his
own for that matter, but instead he’d

wanted to be part of the plan that had
dragged him halfway across the world.
So here he was. He hadn’t thought
streets could get any more crowded
than they’d already been, but regard-
less of his attitude they’d accomplished
that anyway, and as if that wasn’t
bad enough, the temple Eden had ar-
ranged for him to visit wasn’t located
in the district of the gods at all.
No,
it was down by the Tongue waterfront.
The address had been off along a lane
of warehouses,
of all things,
their
whitewashed
walls
glistening
with
salt-spray mist and the street cobbles
scarred from the passage of over-laden
wagons.
These streets were jammed
too, ﬁlled with overﬂow from the banks
of the Tongue.
Even though the tra-
ditional squid-spectacular wasn’t sup-
posed to start until tomorrow, revelers
and vendors of everything from re-

freshments to choice bleacher seats
were jockeying for position wherever
there was a space big enough to plant
a foot. Jurtan had clearly been in the
wrong place, since the street number
on his note proved to yield just another
anonymous warehouse door, but he’d
knocked anyway, and a bearded man
had arrived to let him in. The man had
led him through a small entry hall into
the warehouse proper, which indeed
turned out to be a temple, pointed out
a place for him in an empty pew, and
returned to his station by the door.
The interior was given over to a
high-ceilinged chamber of assembly
more
stylishly
appointed
than
the
shabby outside facade had implied.
It wasn’t the appointments that fos-
tered the image of reﬁnement; in fact,
the temple was strikingly clear of the
usual fetishes and efﬁgies and altars.

Aside from a few stained-glass win-
dows on abstract themes which he
thought mainly involved ﬁre and trees,
with here and there a recognizable
chicken or sheep or ﬁsh, and a raised
presentation-area in front, the cham-
ber was undecorated.
The ranks of
pews in a dark polished wood, and the
similarly paneled ﬂoor, however, were
set off dramatically against the cream-
colored walls, contoured into a cunning
series of setbacks and alcoves beneath
the undulating ceiling. As far as Jur-
tan could remember, this was his ﬁrst
experience of architecture motivated
by deliberate tact and restraint, but he
found he rather liked it.
The religionists and their mysteri-
ous service already in progress, though,
were a different matter. As soon as he’d
come through the door, his internal mu-
sic had begun imitating their ongoing

ritual, a sort of a wailing minor-key
chant built out of repeating melodic
units. Up in the front on the podium,
a line of four or ﬁve readers were es-
chewing the comfortable chairs be-
hind them for a cross-legged position
sitting on the ﬂoor, from which they
were singing aloud in turn from a text,
chapter by chapter. The congregation,
matching them privation for priva-
tion, were also arrayed on the ﬂoor
in the aisles, occasionally humming
along with the reader of the moment
for a choice passage or two. Everyone
sounded thoroughly miserable.
But
what was the point?
Mass hypnosis,
maybe - if all this kept up much longer
he’d probably be humming along too.
Jurtan had tipped his head back to bet-
ter study the way the skylights were
tucked into the folds of the roof, and to
watch through them the declining light

of evening, when he realized that some-
one had slipped into the pew next to
him. The man was alternately paying
attention to the keening from the stage
and twisting in the pew to scrutinize
Jurtan.
“Blessed be those who join with us,”
the man whispered after a moment.
“I’m not joining anything,” Jurtan
said. “I’m only here because my friends
thought you might be able to help us.”
The fellow adjusted his headdress, a
sort of ﬂat turban, before responding.
“Within a traditional greeting may still
be a message of deeper truth.”
Creeps and kooks, what other kind
of person did the world contain? “Look,
I’m sorry if I’ve showed up at a bad
time.
Why don’t I come back when
you’re not in the middle of a service?”
Or better yet, maybe he’d manage not
to come back at all. In fact -

“Eden Shaa is not one to watch her
calendar too closely,” the man com-
mented. “Yet any request from her is
one we are only too happy to rush to
fulﬁll.
This has nothing to do with
her endowment of this building, you
understand.”
“Of course,” said Jurtan, who indeed
suddenly felt as though he did have
some greater idea of something that
was going on. He ﬁshed around in his
pack and came up with the Iskendar-
ian page Max had let him take. “We
wanted to know what you could make
of this document.”
The religionist perused it with pursed
lip.
“Tarfon should see this,” he al-
lowed after a moment. “His section of
the lamentation will be ﬁnished mo-
mentarily.”
The high-pitched guy currently wail-
ing up on the stage? Oh, great. “Uh,

excuse me, but do you do this stuff all
the time?”
The man rocked back and forth a few
times in apparent consideration. “This
is a day of commemoration, a fast day,
a day of meditation on the state of the
world. This is the day when we remem-
ber the calamities of the past, ours and
the world’s, when we learn from what
we have lost what our task is for today.
We acknowledge that God, for our sins,
has cast us out of our land, our age, our
-”
“God?”
“We worship the One God,” the man
conﬁrmed.
“The One God? Which one? Gashanat
Slugan Kaporis -”
“The Ineffable One, the One who can
neither be seen or heard, the -”
“What good is that? Isn’t the whole
reason you want to tie yourself to a

god because of the stuff they can do for
you?”
The man made an expression that
was more smile than rictus, but shared
an appreciable amount of both. “That
is indeed the current sentiment.
We
are certainly behind the times, but
what can we do? We believe what we
believe.
Some consider it a curse to
bear witness to the truth.
We think
it is a blessing, but I will grant you it
is often a fairly problematic one. Our
history is not pleasant.”
And there was a whole temple full
of people as crazy as this guy was?
Or half full, anyway? “Why don’t the
gods you don’t believe in wipe you out,
then? They don’t like to be ignored, not
to mention disbelieved.”
“The world is full of cranks who re-
main beneath notice,” the man said
with a thoroughly straight face. “But,

no, I didn’t say we don’t believe in
them; that would be denying empiri-
cal reality. We just don’t think they’re
gods. Ah, here’s Tarfon.”
As the new person, his chanting
complete, came stalking up the aisle, it
occurred to Jurtan that this was in fact
just the kind of loony organization the
Shaas might be likely to hang around
with. They were, after all, more than
a little loopy themselves.
Was Eden
just a supporter or an out-and-out
believer?
Zalzyn Shaa’s attitude of
sardonic disdain also might owe more
than a chance amount to this sort of
variant ideology. There were obviously
more people running around off the
beaten track than he’d suspected.
Even if they were crazy, that didn’t
mean they might not know something.
Maybe this Tarfon guy ...
or rather,
this Tarfon woman.
Or girl?
The

contralto had thrown him off, and he
clearly hadn’t been paying enough at-
tention anyway. “Mirror writing,” Tar-
fon said immediately on being handed
the document. “Distorted script, too.”
She perused it for a few moments in
silence. “The letters belong to another
language than the one in which the
sheet is written.
The writer is using
the letters to make a phonetic tran-
script.”
“So you can’t read it?” Jurtan said.
She glanced brieﬂy up at him. “Cer-
tainly I can read it. I know the script
system from a few book fragments in
my father’s library, and I can piece
together the meaning in the other
language as I go along.
Both of the
languages are pre-Dislocation, but this
page here is a good few hundred years
post.”
“How can you tell?”

“Look here.” Tarfon indicated a sec-
tion of text at the top of the page. Max
had given him one of the pages that
contained only line after line of unbro-
ken writing, without any of the draw-
ings or equations featured in some of
the other material. “It’s context. The
writer refers to the God of Curses, and
then here’s a mention of something
called the Steadfast Spell. The modern
gods appeared with the Dislocation,
and magic too of course, so that imme-
diately tells us this had to be written
after that time. Then here’s an aside
about Abysinnia the Moot.” Tarfon
stared at the passage, then suddenly
blushed. “Um, it looks like old gossip,
actually. I can’t make it all out.”
“What about your father?” Jurtan
said. “You learned from him? Maybe
he could help more.”
“I learned from his library,” Tarfon

told him evenly. “That’s all he left me.
He died when I was a child.”
“Sorry,” Jurtan muttered. Maybe he
should work more on learning when
to keep his mouth shut, or at least
on practicing a better way to phrase
things.
“You couldn’t have known,” said Tar-
fon, “and it’s not recent news, either.
Aki, why couldn’t you read this? I know
you know -”
The ﬁrst man stroked his beard and
merely raised an eyebrow.
“Oh, another one of your practical
lessons, right?” Tarfon put on an ex-
pression
of
deliberate
bemusement.
“One of these days...”
“Eventually Tarfon will take my
place,” Aki said to Jurtan.
Tarfon was ignoring him, or perhaps
she was only engrossed back in the doc-
ument. “This isn’t the only page,” she

stated.
“No,” Jurtan said. “That’s right.” His
authorization from Max had extended
far enough to admit that.
“There’s
enough stuff to ﬁll a sack.”
“I’m not surprised. The writer seems
to be writing notes to himself. Or her-
self, that’s not clear. More than notes,
really - more of a complete personal his-
tory. Look, here the writer refers back
to a incident he’s apparently already
discussed, and here he talks about For-
mula 138.”
“You mean this is a book of mem-
oirs?”
“I don’t know,” said Tarfon.
“I’m
not sure.
Perhaps I just don’t have
enough of a command of the language.
It sounds less like storytelling, though,
and more like ...
how would you de-
scribe it?”
“Lessons,” said Aki.
“Instructions.

Very curious; it does seem to use a
didactic style.
Would you like us to
review the rest of this material?”
“Yeah,” Jurtan said. “We sure would,
except you’ve got to come to where it
is.”
“A reasonable precaution, the streets
being what they are,” allowed Aki.
Jurtan gave the address, and they
set an appointment for a date after the
congestion from the Running would
presumably have let up. Jurtan didn’t
forget to thank them both; he thought
he even managed to do that without
punching himself in the mouth again
with his foot. As he was exiting back
onto the road outside, though, think-
ing how nice it was to get away from
that weird sect and out from under
their mournful chanting, no matter
how helpful they might or might not
have been, he realized that he had not

actually escaped after all.
His mind
was still playing that damn chant at
him.
“Stop it,” he muttered. “What’s got-
ten into you?” That’s all he needed,
a built-in torture squad.
The music
wasn’t giving him any particular mes-
sage, either; it was just loping along
while driving him up the wall.
He broke free of the warehouse row
onto a major street.
To the right to-
ward the Tongue Water, the boulevard
fed into one of the big bridges.
As
it crossed the center of the channel it
sprouted a second level, an observation
deck, now a focus of the attention of a
crew of workers hanging bunting and
scrubbing down surfaces, and another
crew of toughs mounting guard.
The
last thing Jurtan wanted at the mo-
ment was to ﬁght the throng to look at
a grandstand, though, so he turned his

back on the scene and began to ﬁght
his way in the other direction.
Next
to him, the middle of the boulevard
was still being kept clear for a single
lane of vehicle and mounted trafﬁc in
each direction. He had been consider-
ing hitching a ride when it occurred to
him that his internal music had indeed
ﬁnally changed.
On top of the chant was a new horn
theme. A new? - no, he’d heard it be-
fore ... with the Underlings. No, not
with the Underlings, but while he’d
been playing with them. It was ... oh.
Oh! It was the melody that had come
with that man who’d been paying a
little too much attention to Tildy.
Where was it coming from now? A
closed carriage, clattering away from
the bridge toward him along the road.
Jurtan didn’t think twice. He slipped
through a gap in the trafﬁc behind

the tailboard of a water-wagon and a
party of horsemen heading toward the
bridge just behind it, teetered for a
brief moment at the shifting boundary
between the east and west lanes, and
then launched himself with a rapid
sprint at the rear of the carriage as
it rattled past.
A narrow footboard
protruded beyond the hamper trunk
strapped to the hindmost part of the
vehicle. Was it too narrow? Running
just behind, Jurtan managed to slip a
hand around one of the trunk straps
and swing himself up.
The perch was precarious but not im-
possible. With his arm tucked through
the strap he could maintain his seat,
his legs dangling and his feet a good
foot off the roadbed.
As long as the
driver didn’t accelerate ...
but then
there was just about no place in Peri-
dol at the moment where you could

move faster than a trot. Jurtan settled
himself back for the duration.
Except... what was he really doing
here, anyway? It was sort of a damn
fool stunt, when you thought about it.
What if he was following the person
who’d been pursuing his sister, and
what if this person actually did have
some nefarious intent? What would he
do about it? More likely he’d just get
yelled at by some complete bystander.
It was a fool stunt - it was exactly
the sort of thing Jurtan thought Max
would be likely to pull.
Of course, on the other hand -
A sliding of wood just above his head
caught Jurtan’s attention. He craned
around just as the sliding rear window
in the carriage’s landau top slammed
shut again. Jurtan hadn’t caught the
slightest glimpse of whomever might
be inside, and the angle was awkward

- perhaps they hadn’t seen him either.
Perhaps -
A powerful whistle pierced the air
from virtually overhead, from within
the carriage.
Jurtan went to slip his
arm free from the strap ... slip his arm
free - his arm was stuck, dammit! Be-
hind the carriage, three horsemen had
broken loose from the press of follow-
ing trafﬁc and were bashing their way
toward him, their eyes clearly locked
on one thing and one thing only. Belat-
edly Jurtan’s internal music was warn-
ing him of something dangerous in his
immediate surroundings.
Thanks a
lot, he thought, and just then his hand
did come free, a metal buckle on the
strap gouging a nice chunk out of his
forearm in facilitation.
Jurtan spun
free and slid off his perch, staggered
as he hit the ground, still moving with
the momentum of the carriage, and

then hit a patch of fresh sewage not
yet considered by the sanitation crews;
his legs ﬂew out from under him and
he smashed full-on into the pavement.
Ahead was a team of oxen, behind
was the carriage, rolling to a sudden
halt, and to the side were the converg-
ing horsemen.
Jurtan scrambled to-
ward the center of the street, away
from the nearest ox and the guys
on the horses, and from whomever
had jumped clear of the carriage and
was now coming around its corner in
his direction.
As he stumbled ahead
while looking over his shoulder, Jurtan
abruptly caught his foot on yet another
obstacle and tripped, again - the low
curb dividing the two directions of traf-
ﬁc, that was it, he thought dazedly, as
the pavement came up at him once
more.
This time he caught himself on his

hands, grinding skin off his palms and
knuckles but keeping his face intact.
The ﬁrst swordsman was trying to
maneuver his horse around the now-
interposing oxen, and a chorus of an-
gry shouting had broken out. Jurtan
got himself to his feet and launched
himself weaving back through the op-
posing trafﬁc - a blast of discordant
trumpets hit him at the same mo-
ment as something massive walloped
him across the side of his head. He’d
straightened too much, Jurtan realized
in a dull haze, and one of the horsemen
had managed to sweep across over the
oxen with a long sword or a spear and
catch him a good solid blow.
Somehow he made it across the
street.
Beyond the churned ditch, a
knot of people were hooting and yelling
at him. Someone clobbered him with
a market basket as he plowed through

them, “all in good fun, no doubt,” he
found himself muttering, “but if it’s all
the same to you I’d -”
With that,
something round and
squishy and extremely foul-smelling
hit him right on the nose.
A rotten
cabbage? He needed an alley - where
was an alley?
There!
Jurtan was a
good half-block down the alley heading
away from the street before he heard
pounding feet behind him. What had
he stirred up? All this over hitching a
ride? It was -
The alley jogged again and split. He
had no idea of the tricks of the neigh-
borhood, where he was or where he
was going, and for that matter why
wasn’t his music being more helpful
too?
Actually, it was trying, Jurtan
realized as he staggered to the left,
he was just too dazed to pay enough
attention.
He risked another glance

back over his shoulder - he couldn’t see
anyone, but he could hear them, and
his music seemed to think that letting
them catch up with him might not be a
very good idea at all. That didn’t seem
to be the music’s only concern, though.
What else was it -
The ground, unpaved since he’d en-
tered the ﬁrst alley, had been growing
progressively more ﬁlth-heaped and
decrepit as he’d gone along. People in
the surrounding buildings were clearly
used to dumping their trash and offal
into it and then moving away to an-
other neighborhood, but even so, the
surface was distinctly more boggy than
it had been a few blocks earlier. Jurtan
scrambled over a fall of construction
stones where the side of a building had
subsided into the alley and slid down
the other end, slid down ... down? The
surface wasn’t merely yielding beneath

his feet, it was sucking, and then the
ground was sliding too, sliding down,
collapsing! -
Jurtan ﬂailed with both arms. But
there was no purchase - he was only
dragging more muck in on top of him.
What was a sinkhole doing in the mid-
dle of a city, in the middle of Peridol,
for gods’ sake?
- Goo slimed into his
mouth, covered his eyes. He was kick-
ing, thrashing, writhing, but there was
no air, there was a terrible pounding in
his head, there was...
There was movement. He was slip-
ping, rolling, upside down now, wal-
lowing down a chute or a hillside or
- one clawing hand tore free.
Jurtan
lurched up, caught a gasp mixed half
of disgusting air and half of mud before
feeling himself bowled over again. Rot-
ted pilings glimmered above; then, as
he went head over heels into the mire,

ahead and below there was a glint and
the splash of water.

Chapter25
“WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO JU-
RTAN MONT?” Shaa asked, survey-
ing the street full of people ahead.
“Damned if I know,” said Max. He
rubbed an extra-bristly eyebrow; today
was a day of full disguise.
“He went
out to see the One God people yester-
day and never came back.”
“You don’t suppose he could have got-
ten lost?”
“Overnight? Anyway, he had direc-

tions. From what Svin said about his
performance the other night he proba-
bly stopped at some music club and got
turned out into the gutter when they
closed. He’ll wash up eventually, I’m
sure.”
“Yet whatever the results of his mis-
sion might have been,” Shaa observed,
“they remain unreported.”
“I didn’t really expect anything use-
ful, but you’re right, it would have been
nice to know.” Max snorted. “What did
we drag the kid along for, then, any-
way?”
“An exercise in education, wasn’t it?
Although you did mutter something
about him being a secret weapon, as I
recall.”
“All I can say is he’s sure been a
pretty effective secret.” Jurtan Mont
was purely a side issue, but Max was
perfectly happy to be discussing him,

rather than have Shaa focus again on
something more central, such as where
they were going and what they were
going to do there. You couldn’t ask for
a better cover story than the Running
of the Squids, of course, but Shaa had
an uncanny talent for snifﬁng out the
presence of one of Max’s stratagems.
Especially when it might directly in-
volve Shaa himself.
Fortunately Shaa was off his game.
“Actually, I was giving serious consider-
ation to taking to my bed,” Shaa had
said grumpily when Max had arrived
to roust him out, asking heartily what
he had planned for the day.
“Nonsense!” Max had told him. “And
miss the Running of the Squids? Now
that you’re back in Peridol and all?
That’s not the Shaa I know.”
“You said it,” groused Shaa, “I didn’t.
Do you know your tone of voice is far

too light for credibility?”
In the event Max had won out, and
so here they were; the two of them and
what appeared to be the entire pop-
ulation of Peridol, if not the western
world.
“It is a pleasant day for it,” Shaa al-
lowed. “If one likes sunshine, that is.
I’m not going to have to watch you com-
pete, am I?”
“Why would I want to do something
like that? What’s to gain? I seem to
have all the notoriety I need at the mo-
ment.”
“Too many of our activities lately
have seemed to culminate with some-
one ending up in a body of water,” said
Shaa. “I was only asking.”
“I’m
staying
on
dry
land,”
Max
stated. “That other Running was quite
enough to last me a longer time than
this.”

Up ahead now as they bashed and
elbowed their way along was the main
Tongue Water bridge decked out with
its event marshal’s reviewing stand.
“Did your plans extend so far as to in-
volve a vantage point with a ﬁeld of
view?” inquired Shaa.
“You mean watching the spectators
isn’t enough for you?” Indeed,
the
spectators were a show-and-a-half all
by themselves.
Fish and other sea
creatures were the order of the day,
but they were only an aid to inspira-
tion rather than any sort of restraint.
There were the food-vendors, of course,
slinging ﬁsh fried, sauteed, pickled,
and raw along their portable service
counters or through the air at their
customers; there were ﬁsh balls, ﬁsh
broths, ﬁsh sculptures; catﬁsh, pike,
perch, trout, ﬂounder, bass, salmon,
halibut, mackerel, cod, carp, eel, sword-

ﬁsh, tuna, pompano, sardine, haddock
- and those were only a selection of
the sea creatures with scales and ﬁns.
Mounds of shells awaiting preparation
or already consumed lined the gutters
and crunched underfoot, and off to the
side a gang of urchins were playing
pitch-and-catch with what appeared
to be the remains of an entire bed of
clams.
Next to the game, a juggling
troupe wearing on their chests the
emblem of a startled grouper, com-
plete with animated pop-eyes, were
tossing and twirling small octopuses,
or at least their stuffed efﬁgies. Ten-
tacles whirled in the air, entwining
in artful pinwheels and whirlpools of
color. Overhead ﬂew long stylized ban-
ners, taking in the air through gaping
mouths and gill slits and pufﬁng out
their red and bright orange bodies.
And then there was the crowd itself,

or at least the minor part without a par-
ticular scheme or proﬁt-making goal.
Plainly not everyone was costumed,
but the riot of odd sights parading
past made the more typical majority
fade into obscurity like sun-bleached
wallpaper. Headdresses were the most
common, some purchased from the tall
waving stacks artfully balanced by the
omnipresent hat-hucksters, with the
result that waving eyestalks and droop-
ing ﬂagellae and gape-lipped mackerel
assaulted the eye in every direction.
Here though too was a proudly prom-
enading school of two-footed herring,
and trailing behind them two criss-
crossing sharks, their dorsal ﬁns cruis-
ing above the head-level of the throng.
At the bridge-rail -
A vast shout had broken out on the
bridge, and was even now rippling
across the crowd as spectators turned

and craned and gaped.
Atop the re-
viewing stand, a human ﬁgure, radiat-
ing a golden glow even in the sunlight,
had stepped up on a platform and
was waving at the multitude. “What,
Maximillian,” said Shaa, “not even the
barest yelp from you of communal ap-
proval?
No acknowledgement of the
presence of a great one in our midst?”
“It’ll take a lot more than a personal
appearance by Phlinn Arol to make
me stand up and holler,” Max said.
Phlinn’s advent did mean that they
might be drawing close to getting ofﬁ-
cially underway, though. It was time
to start looking out for the one Max
was there to meet. He’d been on guard
all morning, of course; even more so
than usually.
Once he’d taken the
thing from the lab into his possession
again late the previous night extreme
prudence had been indicated.
It had

taken until almost morning to make
the other preparations after Leen had
messengered over the scanty results of
her research the night before, but who
needed sleep at a time like this? He’d
napped before the stuff from Leen had
arrived, anyway.
The god was probably already around
He’d have to reveal himself eventually,
hopefully in the manner they’d agreed
upon in their exchange of messages
yesterday evening.
Still, some sort
of preemptive strike couldn’t be en-
tirely ruled out. The amulet gave Max
the beneﬁt of anonymity, although the
thing in his pocket might have some-
thing to say about that too. When it
came right down to it, there was no
substitute for old-fashioned vigilance.
“As long as we’re here,” said Shaa,
“I would just as soon have something
worthwhile to look at.”

“Right,” Max said.
“Sure.
Let’s go
over here.”
How had he talked her into this?
Perhaps this was what being swept
off your feet really involved.
If so,
Leen could certainly understand why
it had never held any appeal for her.
The question was why she was letting
herself be sucked into it now.
It deﬁed belief. After Max had (af-
ter all) put her in signiﬁcant danger as
part of his own nefarious plot, after she
had found herself wanting to cosh him
over his head and write him out of her
life, whatever she might have thought
she could be growing to feel about him,
she had simultaneously and to her
great surprise listened when he pro-
posed a favor she could do for him, and
then to her total astonishment discov-
ered she was entertaining the notion
of doing what he’d asked.
True, he

had all but stated that he was putting
himself on the line and changing the
habits of a lifetime in trusting someone
he barely knew, and he had apparently
put himself back into hazard to extri-
cate her from a nasty situation of his
own devising there in the Archives.
But it was increasingly clear that “ap-
parently” and “from the looks of things”
were not only appropriate modiﬁers to
apply to Max’s activities, they were (if
anything) far too weak.
Max clearly
couldn’t do something simply if he
could rather, with a little thought, com-
plicate it beyond understanding.
So
who knew what he was really up to?
For that matter, who knew who he re-
ally was, and not as a matter of surface
identity, either? It was questionable if
he even knew himself.
Only the problem plainly wasn’t
Max. It was her. She’d held the power

to squash him, probably. Certainly she
still had the choice to walk away. She
kept telling herself she was explicitly
undecided about what to do about him,
right? So what was she doing here?
Maybe he reminded her of her brother
but without the sticky issues of consan-
guinity.
Still, it was developing to be a nice
day, if you liked this sort of thing, and
if you liked mobs, of course. Leen was
ﬁnding she didn’t mind the excuse
to be out for the Running.
It might
be overwrought and it might be gar-
ish, and the whole idea was without
a doubt more than vaguely ridiculous,
but there was certainly nothing else
like it. It wouldn’t be anything like the
time she’d gone with her grandfather,
the famous year that a full score of
celebrants had run the oars of a galley
in center channel while being ﬂanked

by a pod of killer whales. The whales
had been preoccupied with keeping an
eye on the pair of cuttleﬁsh ahead of
them, jockeying for position for the
moment when the restraints came off
at the exit of the Tongue, so several of
the people who’d missed their footing
or had gotten smacked by oars and
had fallen in had actually survived
unscathed, and most of the others had
made it through with the loss of only
minor parts of their anatomy to the
whales’ distracted snacking.
Her grandfather had disapproved
of the bloodletting, of course, but had
been quite open with her afterwards
about its soporiﬁc effect on the masses
and its consequent value as a tool of
state. And no one could deny that, in
the context of the Running at least,
the actual carnage was not the central
point of the celebration.
The specta-

cle of the massed creatures of the sea
proceeding in solemn panoply to pay
homage to the new Emperor, as one
of the several ritualized manifesta-
tions of his power and majesty, was
a sight in the wonders-of-the-world
class. At least in the better years. Who
knew how it would turn out this time
around?
Advances in sanitation and
sewage disposal since the last Knit-
ting had reduced the miasma from
the Tongue, so perhaps not as many
of the sea creatures would sicken or
pass out before completing their tran-
sit, but the water was still not a place
any sane person would willingly dunk
themselves.
Even putting yourself
in a barge at ringside was hazardous
enough, prestige notwithstanding.
No, Leen would have surely drawn
the line at that, if that was what Max
had asked of her. It was just as well

he’d suggested she do what she’d been
considering anyway, use her pass to
the Emperor’s grandstand. She’d have
as good a view of the Tongue Water
as anyone, she’d be up away from the
vapors, and she’d be able to keep an
eye out for Max himself on the bridge
level below.
When Max appeared, or
when, more precisely (if she was really
going to align herself with his instruc-
tions) Shaa appeared, she would be
positioned to try to join them.
What she hadn’t considered, scan-
ning the crowd below yet again, was
how difﬁcult it would be to spot Max
in the ﬁrst place, even though he’d told
her where they’d be standing. Was this
fated to be her life? Searching for Max
in various venues? She might as well
circulate again, spend some time nod-
ding at the other guests and picking
one or two she knew better than others

to make approving remarks with about
the weather.
At least the Scapula
didn’t seem to be around. He was an-
other complication she surely didn’t
need right at the present. Although as
focussed as he was on climbing the lad-
der of power it was a bit surprising he
wasn’t here, at its momentary center.
Well, perhaps he had some grand en-
trance scheduled for later.
“What do you think this is, anyway?”
Favored-of-the-Gods demanded,
star-
ing at the bird on the Great Karlini’s
shoulder. “What are you supposed to
be disguised as, a pirate?”
“This would need to be a parrot,”
Karlini said testily.
“But it’s not a
parrot. It’s a seagull.”
“I can see it’s a seagull.
You don’t
have an eyepatch either, but -”
“Nervous are you,
Favored one?”
said Haddo, appearing suddenly from

between the traces of a stalled wagon
to rejoin them. “Not ﬁdgety am I.”
Favored wheeled on him, his hands
planted on his hips and his jaw pro-
truding. “Oh, yeah? Which one of us
has been scuttling back and forth for
the last half-hour, doing his best to
wear a groove in the pavement?”
“I have cleared the way,” announced
Svin from ahead of them.
And so he had. The other three ﬁled
and skittered up behind him into the
aisle he was leaving through the press.
This was scarcely, Svin had been re-
ﬂecting, the acme of realized potential
for a warrior born.
It was becoming
ever more clear, though, that birth had
very little to do with how one actually
lived out his life. Here he was, after
all, in the big city for the big festival; a
thief’s paradise, a reaver’s playground,
a brawler’s delight. But what was he

doing? Holding down a regular job.
It was a perversion of his heritage.
On the other hand, it was not only
comfortable, it was habit-forming.
Which was to say, Svin understood
he was having a crisis of identity.
He also had before him the exam-
ple of where all this civilization might
lead him. Up to his neck in plots and
schemes, that was where. To be honest,
though, that was a simplistic argu-
ment.
There was plenty of plotting
back home in the lands of the frozen
north, even on such a basic level as
trying to outwit the animal one hap-
pened to be hunting for dinner.
Was
plotting the natural tendency of sen-
tience? Even more so, was intricacy of
plots perhaps a measure of one’s level
of intelligence?
A new thought occurred to Svin with
a twinge of dread.
Perhaps what he

was really becoming was a philosopher.
“Here stop,” hissed Haddo. “Scatter
should we now. Proceed to rendezvous
will I, while -”
“We’ve got the plan,” snapped Fa-
vored. “Just let’s go ahead and do it,
already.”
Haddo spat something back in Lower
Pocklish and vanished down the inter-
secting street. By Karlini’s estimation
they were several blocks from the wa-
terfront, in the midst of a throng that
was thinning somewhat as folks jos-
tled closer to the bank of the Tongue
Water for the festivities getting under-
way.
“Just as well you didn’t try to
ﬂy your ﬂoater-module,” Karlini said
to Favored. “You’d still never make it
halfway down the block.”
“Then what the hell am I doing
here? Don’t tell me, goddamnit, I know,
I know.”

Svin was back in motion drifting
after Haddo along the street. He cast
a quick glance of disgusted reproach
over his shoulder at Karlini.
Karlini
grunted and resumed his own mean-
dering path as Favored turned back
to rejoin Wroclaw with the equipment
wagon stalled somewhere back behind
them in the trafﬁc.
I really need to
get up some enthusiasm for this job,
Karlini thought. If he was going to be
haphazard about it he might as well
have stayed at home.
Except he didn’t really have a home
at the moment. So what was there to
lose?
Aside from the obvious, of course.
It had been a surprise when Wro-
claw and Haddo had opened up with
the story about Dortonn, the ice sor-
cerer, and his quest of revenge here in
the south. The episode of the icebergs

on the River Oolvaan had now come
clearer, in retrospect, but the subtlety
of craft Dortonn had displayed then
did not diminish through now having
a speciﬁc culprit to whom to tie the in-
cident. Was it a good sign that Karlini
had been the one to triumph in that
engagement? Not necessarily. It had
clearly been a shot across the bow, an
announcement of Dortonn’s presence
to those who knew how to read the mes-
sage. Even Karlini’s victory had been
accomplished through main strength
rather than any particular cleverness
on his part.
Forewarned this time, Dortonn should
be signiﬁcantly better equipped.
Karlini could hear Haddo’s voice
muttering in a low tinny tone in his
ear, courtesy of Favored’s short-range
transmission device.
Haddo had al-
most balked at that part of the plan,

but with the crowds likely to be as con-
gested as they in fact had turned out
to be, the problem of keeping in visual
contact had begun to weigh on him.
The fact that Favored’s gadget, with
no magical emanations, should be in-
visible to Dortonn’s inevitable security
probe had been the deciding factor.
“Nearing am I site of message,”
Haddo whispered.
“Back from water-
front by block it is, with boards covered
are windows.”
Karlini could see the place too, al-
though Haddo with his short stature
was not in evidence. Favored should be
moving into position down whatever
passed for an alley behind the building,
or on the roof if no alley was available,
and Svin - there Svin was, loitering
across the street and having a deep
conversation with his sword.
Karlini
strolled ahead down the block, paying

no attention to any of them. In fact, he
wasn’t paying much attention to them,
at least not directly. Sifting the cryptic
information from a battery of passive
probes was enough to keep him busy.
“Ow - there, watch where you’re go-
ing!” said someone in front of Karlini,
or perhaps partially underfoot. Karlini
grunted and maintained stride.
“Inside am I now,” reported Haddo.
“Derelict is interior, decrepit and with
cobwebs hung.
No sign see I of Dor-
tonn.”
Dortonn’s instructions, arriving ear-
lier that morning by an anonymous
messenger hired off the street, had
however been clear.
Haddo moved
deeper into the building from the door-
way. Like the windows, the door had
been boarded shut, but the promised
loose board and the gap at the lower
edge of the sprung frame had allowed

entry, although even for Haddo it had
been a tight ﬁt. No doubt this was all
part of whatever clever plan Dortonn
had coined for keeping himself safe
while still getting his hands on -
Something creaked loudly in the
gloom.
“Come, come, Fist of Dor-
tonn,” said an echoing voice. “Straight
ahead.”
“Always had you nasty sense of hu-
mor,” Haddo called out. Haddo’s night
vision was certainly good enough to
show him the blank wall he would
have plowed into had he followed the
instruction. Even if he’d had his eyes
closed, there were still his instincts,
too. Still, as Dortonn cackled to him-
self over his own attempt at amuse-
ment, Haddo dodged a pile of waste
provided by an earlier occupant and
edged through a sagging doorway.
Dortonn was wearing a short-sleeved

tunic tucked into loose traveling pants.
His arms were bare, which should
be helpful.
Of course, Dortonn was
used to the frozen north, so even the
seasonal climate this distance south
would seem tropically sultry.
“Meet
now do we at last face-to-face,” Haddo
stated.
Dortonn ended his laughter with a
choke and a cough and a sparkling
gesture toward Haddo.
“I am not in
a mood for banter,” he said, stepping
closer across the small inner room.
“Where is Pod Dall? Give the ring to
me now.”
Haddo noted that ice had once again
encased his feet. Well, that was not ex-
actly unexpected. Still, his hand was
free. Haddo reached into his cloak and
felt for the ring.
“No, get away, get away!” said Tildami
Mont, trying to dodge the attentions

of another street vendor waving yet
another appalling treat-on-a-stick in
her direction. She didn’t even like ﬁsh.
So why had she bothered to go out for
this Festival of All Fish thing in the
ﬁrst place? True, Roni had told her not
to miss it. But if it was such a big deal,
why hadn’t Roni wanted to be there?
She hadn’t wanted to leave Roni
alone either, with everyone else hav-
ing disappeared on their mysterious
errands or heading out to the water-
front for the festivities.
Why knew
what they were really up to - no one
seemed to be communicating any more
these days. But Roni had brushed off
her arguments, reminding Tildy that
she’d been at this business long enough
that nothing surprised her. Roni also
wanted to have enough peace and quiet
to concentrate on some serious work
for a change. She’d been talking about

a new unifying hypothesis, something
she was calling the Mediator mecha-
nism. “Intermediary agents that trans-
late your command into the smaller
bits the magic organelles can actually
handle; somewhat similar to translat-
ing a language,” that’s what Roni had
said, anyway.
True, it did sound all
by itself like something that needed
translation from a foreign language,
but that wasn’t really the point. The
point was that Roni was responsible
for herself, and if she wanted to stay
and work, what did Tildy have to say
about it?
The deciding factor,
though,
had
been her brother.
Or more precisely,
the lack of her brother.
He certainly
wasn’t responsible for himself, not if
he’d gone off on a simple errand and
never come back. Tildy could do two
things at once - track him down at

whatever club he’d disappeared to, and
take in the sights of today’s spectacular
while she was at it. Except it hadn’t
been that simple.
Tildy had stopped ﬁrst to pick up
Dalya Hazeel at her establishment,
but the place had been closed for the
Running and Dalya was nowhere to
be found.
Of the other clubs on the
way to the waterfront Dalya had men-
tioned to her earlier, most were closed
too and those that weren’t professed
to know nothing.
Tildy had ﬁnally
found herself close to the Tongue Wa-
ter with nothing to show for it but the
exercise. She’d gone ahead and found
the address to which Jurtan had been
sent, and the door hadn’t even been
locked, but the only person in the place
had been an old caretaker who hadn’t
been of much help. Yes, he thought he
might have seen somebody like Jurtan

around in the afternoon yesterday, but
he didn’t know for certain and any-
way he was sure this possibly mythical
person would have left.
Maybe he’d hung around to get a
good position for the festival.
Some
of the prime sites were on the big
bridge nearby, the one with the Em-
peror’s grandstand. As long as she was
in the vicinity Tildy thought it was
worth a try. She dodged another street
hawker and began forcing her way up
the boulevard toward the bridge rising
a block ahead.
The grandstand did indeed offer a
commanding view.
If it served virtu-
ally all of the time as a harbormaster’s
lookout and command center, it had
still been transformed quite effectively
for the present into a gala spectator
gallery in the sky.
The bunting and
festive efﬁgies of sea creatures that

adorned the walls and pylons also
helped to conceal the detachment of
troops and sorcerers deployed around
the margin and on the subdeck un-
der the ﬂoor. Another party of invited
guests appeared at the top of the stair-
case from the main level of the bridge
below, having made it through the cor-
don and the checkpoints, and headed
with relief toward the refreshment
tables.
But he was here to observe the
niceties and to show the ﬂag, of course,
not to lollygag.
Phlinn Arol again
raised a hand and waved at the crowd.
From this height, and his position at
the center of the bridge and accord-
ingly above the midpoint of the Tongue
Water, his perspective of the scene be-
low was that of an endless carpet of
massed spectators interrupted only by
the surface of the water itself, and not

even entirely by that. There were the
ranks of festive barges at the banks,
moored carefully off the navigation
channel, and then the much more dar-
ing vessels, coracles to two-masters to
racing galleys, that were darting back
and forth through the open channel
itself. None of the swimmers had ob-
viously entered the water, although it
wasn’t certain he’d be able to spot them
from this vantage point.
He had picked out two of the lure-
boats and was scouting for a third, as
a way of giving himself something to
concentrate on in the midst of the end-
less roar of the crowd, when he became
aware of someone else at his elbow
watching along with him. Was it time
for his traditional empowerment of the
Emperor?
No, not yet. “Enjoying the spectacle,
cousin?” inquired Phlinn Arol.

“I suppose,” said the other.
“It’s a
nice day for it, at least.
Someone’s
dealt away with the coastal fog.”
“Not you, I take it?”
“Weather is scarcely my forte.” The
fellow rested his hands on the rail and
gazed out at the throng. “You, though,
are certainly fulﬁlling your civic duty,
I must say. At least as far as our re-
lationship with the power structure of
the mundane world is concerned.”
“We did make a pact,” Phlinn ob-
served. “Someone has to keep it going.”
“Your dedication to the public good is
admirable.”
“No more than any of us should be
doing, hmm?”
“Bravo,” the man said conversation-
ally.
“You’ll pardon me if I infer a
implied commentary between your re-
mark and the actual divergent state of
affairs?”

“Infer to your content,” said Phlinn.
“Even for those of us who know where
we stand the world seems increasingly
a muddle. Perhaps especially for those
who know where they stand.
In a
breakdown of order, stances, no matter
how principled or well-founded, can
start to seem rather beside the point.”
“There are some who agitate for a
turn to a strong central leadership.”
“There are some who point out a de-
cided lack of strong leaders. The days
of the giants among us are gone.”
“Not necessarily,” said Gashanatantra
“Atsing and her crowd may be burnt
out and retired, but that isn’t to say
there aren’t some in the current gener-
ation who might not be up to the job,
given a chance to grow into it. Neither
of us are exactly youngsters. Did you
know that Byron recruited me? No, I
didn’t think you did.”

Phlinn raised the other arm for a
change, and was rewarded by a new
surging bellow from the multitude.
“That is interesting,” he allowed after
a moment, “but scarcely germane. As
close as I was to him, and as much as I
try to keep his legacy alive, Byron was
not exactly a great leader himself. He
was rather a bit too much given to act-
ing on impulse, and when he did pause
for consideration in advance he had a
tendency toward convolution over clar-
ity.
Perhaps that’s why he liked you.
Anyway it’s all moot.”
“We need Byron,” Gashanatantra
stated.
“He designed the infrastruc-
ture; he may be the only one who could
still disentangle the state it’s grown
into.”
Gash was still leaning on the guardra
with his eyes ﬁxed on the display be-
low, but Phlinn Arol knew better than

to assume that he wasn’t still watch-
ing his reaction as well. “Byron’s dead,”
Phlinn said. “He’s been dead for a long
time.”
“No,” said Gash. “No, I’m not so cer-
tain he is.”
“Is that librarian woman around?”
Shaa asked.
“Why,” said Max, glancing around,
“do you see her?”
“Noo,” Shaa drawled. “But since you
are obviously up to something, I was
nibbling about for hints concerning its
nature.”
Max opened his mouth to respond,
but just then the volume of sound
jumped again. Above them and down
at the center of the bridge, the Emperor-
designate had mounted his podium of
state.
Another ﬁgure was with him;
Phlinn Arol.
Together they raised
their arms. A nimbus of golden light

settled over them in a blare of trum-
pets, the multitude roared, and then
far away down the Tongue Water an-
other wave of commotion began to roll
toward them, given by its magnitude
and distance the character of an ap-
proaching storm. Around the far bend
and beyond the next major bridge to
the south, in the center of the channel,
the water began to mound up and drift
toward them.
Behind the mound a
wave curled toward each shore.
“Look at that,” said Max.
“I guess
they’re not extinct after all.”
A spray of mist and water erupted
into the air from the fore-point of the
traveling bulge. “The lure-masters will
be the toast of some serious festivities
tonight,” Shaa agreed.
“They won’t be the only ones. Can
you believe those idiots?”
“They will be the only ones,” Shaa

said, “unless these guys are better
than they look and somehow manage
to survive.” On either side of the huge
whale, a small pack of people had ap-
peared, trying to mount the crest of
the wave on swim-boards. On the left,
two of them collided and went over,
sweeping away a third. Several knots
of furiously paddling celebrants were
attaining the churning wave-top, how-
ever, and rising to their feet atop their
boards.
Then the leviathan passed
under the center span of the south
bridge.
The
wave-riders
were
frantically
scattering to avoid the bridge pilings
and the few bottom-protruding ele-
ments of architectural substructure.
As the head of the whale appeared
from
the
bridge’s
shadow,
though,
something separated itself from the
edge of the deck and hurtled toward

it. A person? Yes, indeed. He or she
landed on the whale’s back behind the
blowhole and scrabbled frantically, but
somehow managed to hold on.
Behind the leviathan a devilﬁsh
broke the surface, its wide leathery
wings ﬂapping, and quickly nosed back
under. It was followed into view, how-
ever, by a pair of breaching swordﬁsh.
The swordﬁsh seemed to hang glis-
tening in the air free of the water for
an exceptional length of time, before
abruptly
reversing
end-for-end
and
disappearing again into the water. Be-
hind them now, even further out, were
the ﬁrst of the cuttleﬁsh.
“This does
have potential of being a reasonable
outing, at that,” Shaa acknowledged.
“I - Maximillian?”
Max had given him the slip.
Shaa forced his way away from the
rail. Four or ﬁve people back the crowd

thinned out considerably;
after all,
folks wanted to see, not just hear the
cheers of others. Damn Max! - where
was he?
Or, more to the point, what
was he up to? He - what?
Out of the corner of his eye, Shaa
spotted someone hurrying toward him
from the stairs to the viewing platform,
someone not only hurrying but waving.
Shaa turned and inclined an eyebrow
in lieu of an actual wave back.
Well,
he had had a hunch she’d be around.
Why was it not reassuring to ﬁnd he’d
been right? “Are you enjoying yourself,
Madame Archivist?” he greeted her.
“I -” said Leen, but just then the
bridge rocked, the roadbed shuddering
underfoot. The spectators at the rails
hooted wildly at the arrival at their
station of the leviathan.
“Yes,” said Shaa, “indeed it is a spec-
tacle. A sorry one to miss, too, seeing

as one is already here in the ﬁrst place.
Which is to say, to what do I owe the
pleasure of your company at the mo-
ment?”
Leen stared at him. “I can’t believe
he talked me into this,” she muttered.
“I assume we’re discussing Maximil-
lian?
Many’s the time I’ve had that
same thought. Just what is it he has
talked you into?”
“. . .
It didn’t seem like much,” she
said, resting her hand on his shoulder.
“He wanted me to stay with you while
he went off to meet someone else.”
In point of fact, Max was barely
ﬁfty feet away, but was concealed from
Shaa’s view by one of the grandstand-
level’s support pylons.
He was, how-
ever, not alone. “Here it is,” Max said.
The other clenched and unclenched
his good hand. The other arm was en-
cased in a cast and splint. “Give it to

me.”
“You should be able to feel it from
where you are, right?” Max told him.
“You can tell it’s the real article. And
don’t think about double-crossing me
and taking it off my body, because I’ve
got the safeguards bound to me, just
like we said. No, you do your part and
I’ll release it.”
The other guy was sweating and
appeared clearly the worse for recent
wear that extended signiﬁcantly be-
yond the busted arm; not at all the sort
of picture gods liked to cut, in Max’s
experience.
Max wasn’t complaining.
Whatever had happened to him had
apparently pushed him over the edge
into agreement with Max’s proposed
deal.
The guy’s teeth snapped shut with a
clack. “Very well,” he said, with obvi-
ous reluctance. He withdrew a small

slate from his jacket, jabbed at it with
his ﬁnger while consulting it closely,
made a few ﬁnal passes, and then
shoved the thing back in his pocket.
“There, it is done.
The curse is re-
moved.”
“What’s the matter?” Leen said.
“All of a sudden I confess I feel rather
strange.” The world was abruptly reel-
ing, Shaa’s insides were rippling, his
heart was – what was his heart doing?
Shaa bent over and put his hands on
his knees.
“Is it your heart?”
His head was hurting now, too; he
felt drunk. Overloaded with excess oxy-
gen? Leen still had him by the shoul-
der, but the site of her grip was tingling.
Some sort of probe? “Damn you, Max,”
Shaa breathed. “What are you up to?”
Leen wasn’t looking at him, though,
she was gazing away up the bridge to-

ward the grandstand. And not just gaz-
ing, either. Now she was nodding.
“Okay,” said Max.
Leen’s gesture
toward him should have meant that
she’d run the probe he’d given her and
had conﬁrmed the status of the curse.
He subvocalized his own trigger-word.
A small whirlwind and a swirl of heat
danced on his palm, then subsided.
“Here it is,” he said, and handed it
over.
“I should blast you now,” said Jardin,
shoving the ring in his pocket.
“I could have let loose against you
too,” Max reminded him, “which was
the whole reason for doing this thing
under the feet of the Emperor and all
your sightseeing god-pals in the ﬁrst
place. I -”
But Jardin was already striding
away.
Just as well.
This wasn’t the
time for gabbing, it was time to get

back to Shaa and have it out.
Max
darted out from behind the pylon and
began making his way back along the
bridge.
There was no warning, only a ﬂicker
of light over his shoulder and a quick
ﬂuorescence
in
his
detection
ﬁeld.
Then a massive WHOOM! burst out
from behind, and a gust of ﬂaming
hellﬁre slammed into him and lifted
him off his feet and sent him hurtling
in a long dive toward the rippling sur-
face of the bridge.
Haddo withdrew his hand from the
cloak and extended the small plain
ring to Dortonn. Dortonn snatched it
away and clenched his ﬁst over it. He
allowed himself a quick supercilious
smirk. “Once a loyal ﬂunky, always the
same, is it not so, O my Fist?”
“As say you must it be, Great Dor-

tonn.”
“We must speak again,” Dortonn
said. He took a single step back and
vanished.
Vanished? - no, Haddo realized, as
a trapdoor in the ﬂoor slammed shut
behind Dortonn’s falling head.
Just
as well, since the ice encasing Haddo’s
own feet still had him locked solidly to
the ﬂoorboards, even though the boots
Favored had whipped up with the inter-
nal heating coils were now radiating
for all they were worth.
And Haddo
had reached the end of his mental
count of ten.
The dark room suddenly lit. Slices
of glaring white lashed up from the
gaps in the ﬂoorboards and sprayed up
through the dusty air and laid a ﬁery
grid across the ceiling.
The expected
shriek of pain from below was simul-
taneous.
Haddo had never doubted

Favored, not really, but it was always
remarkable when one of his tricky de-
vices did its act. With Karlini’s magical
camouﬂage radiating the signature of
the entrapped Pod Dall, the false ring
had obviously felt right to Dortonn. It
wouldn’t have held up to serious prob-
ing for long but it hadn’t had to; it had
been long enough. Favored’s quick fuse
had now run to its end and ignited the
white phosphorus band itself, and the
capsule of clinging ﬁre.
Dortonn was wailing from below as
the light source began to whip back
and forth.
Haddo yanked again and
this time one foot came free, then the
other. The sound of Dortonn was sud-
denly joined by the sound of splinter-
ing wood from behind Haddo at the
front the building. The front door ex-
ploded inward, and then standing next
to Haddo was Svin.
But now Haddo

could hear churning water, too - too
much water for a single swimmer. He
waved his hand at the ﬂoor. The noise
from below was swamped by the quick
grind of an invisible saw against wood,
and the trapdoor and a chunk of ﬂoor-
boards an arm’s-span across converted
themselves into shavings.
Through the new hole under the
building were tarred pilings and lap-
ping water and a murky bank of mud
- obviously an old pier.
In the cen-
ter between the pilings, a twenty- or
thirty-foot drop down, Haddo could see
in the phosphorus glow a stretch of
frothing water, but no Dortonn.
The
glow was coming from just out of sight,
and it was receding. Haddo poked his
head down and craned his neck. A boat
- a small houseboat - was just moving
out of the hiding place and breaking
through a concealing mat of woven

netting into the sunlit Tongue Water
channel beyond. A bubbling wake led
to the houseboat’s stern. “To the water-
front,” said Haddo. “Head him off we
must.”
But Svin was already gone.
Or at
least going - a serious leap took him
over the crater in the ﬂoor, a huge
sword-swing bashed out the wall into
the next room, and then there was
nothing to see but a new cloud of
swirling dust.
Haddo wheeled and
made for the street through the ﬁrst
gap Svin had left in the front wall and
door.
Karlini swung another elbow and
the seagull batted its wings, and the
people in front of him reluctantly
parted again.
One more row of spec-
tators and he’d be at the edge of the
wharf. As nearly as he could determine,
he’d gone straight from the rendezvous

location toward the Tongue Water. The
sides of the channel below were lined
with decorated barges and other small
craft, but these were obviously not
what he was looking for. Where was -
A muttering had started behind him.
The festively dressed spectators were
hugging themselves and stamping sud-
denly against the boards and looking
up at the clear sky.
And then Kar-
lini felt it too - the wave of cold, a
chill harsh enough that it felt like an
abrupt dip in a vat of ice. Not from the
heavens, though.
From underfoot.
Karlini pushed aside the ﬁnal woman
ahead, took a quick glance to verify
his suspicion, and then, even more
quickly,
before his better judgment
had a chance to kick in, vaulted over
the low railing.
The seagull cast an
incredulous glance at Karlini, seeming

to question whether he’d taken leave
of his species identity, and ﬂapped con-
vulsively off his shoulder and away
from him into the air. Below Karlini
for a second was open slack water, and
next to the open area a barge in the
shape of a trumpeter swan occupied by
a group of spectators in the process of
falling over as their vessel was shoved
rudely away.
The space was immedi-
ately ﬁlled by the vessel that had done
the shoving; undoubtedly the house-
boat Haddo was shouting about in his
ear, appearing from beneath the pier
with the remains of a mudbank draped
over its prow and dank mist freezing to
its superstructure. As he landed atop
the cabin, Karlini noted behind him
in the stern gallery a howling human
ﬁgure writhing in a pool of piercing
white and orange ﬂame.
Unexpectedly the boat lifted under

the force of the bow wake from what-
ever creature was passing down the
Tongue. The stern quarter of the boat
bashed against a piling, scraped with
hair-raising intent, and caught up. The
lee side of the breaker poured over the
gunwales, mounting quickly almost to
the top of the cabin. Karlini felt a swirl
of trigger-releases from the ﬁgure in
the stern. A matrix locked into place,
and with a blast of arctic wind the
water atop the ship froze solid.
The boat staggered under the weight
of the ice.
Dortonn, now trapped in
a bubble inside the ice himself, was
continuing to struggle with the ﬁre
that enveloped him, although from the
cloud of steam that was hiding him
from view the ice might be helping
him out. Even if Dortonn was merely
lashing back out of reﬂex or was being
assisted by previously programmed

automatic safeguards, the tactical situ-
ation might very well be shifting in his
favor. Karlini disliked causing death or
severe personal injury through direct
magical action but perhaps this was
a case that warranted it.
Shaa had
taught him how to inﬂict acute cirrho-
sis, and sudden heart failure was al-
ways a classic. Karlini braced himself
on the canted roof and reeled off the
proximate parameters.
Except - why
did his stomach seem to be sinking?
Karlini looked off to the side and
immediately grabbed for the nearest
handhold.
The wharf with its gape-
mouthed crowd was retreating, that
much wasn’t surprising ... but it was
retreating down as much as away! The
boat rocked again, more violently, and
traversed an arc that must have been
ﬁfteen feet wide. Karlini had a quick
view, straight down, of the foaming

water and the sparkling wall rising up
out of it.
The houseboat was embedded in the
top of a growing iceberg.
Shaa and Leen were both looking
straight toward the blast. In the quick
moment
before
Shaa’s
outsweeping
arm carried them both down to hug
the pavement, they could see the clos-
est pillars supporting the observation
deck disappear in red ﬁreballs and
clouds of black smoke, and an expand-
ing hailstorm of hurtling stone and
fragmented steel.
The bridge was
shuddering beneath them - but was
it starting to lean?
Would the entire
structure go down?
Shaa lifted his head for another up-
date.
In the midst of the billowing
smoke, he could see the grandstand
platform collapsing in twisted sections
onto the main roadbed. Part of the far

edge was still in place up above, the
charges on those pylons perhaps hav-
ing failed to detonate. A vast shrieking
clang of metal and the cry of victims
made pandemonium around the ma-
jor part of the wreck, though - and
now a chunk of the main-deck and the
adjoining southside railing were sep-
arating out and tumbling free toward
the water.
A banner of ﬂaming letters was
rising from the smoke, its message
something about liberation and self-
determination and free rights that
seemed somewhat irrelevant in the
present context. Not that too many in
the immediate vicinity were spending
the time to take it in - the part of the
crowd that could stand had begun to
surge away from the center toward
the banks off the bridge, pressing with
increasing force against the equally

packed mass on the approaches and
the shore. Making their way upstream,
though, in a purposeful charge toward
the main mess, were a group of armed
men, whether police or troops or Im-
perial guards was impossible to tell.
The detachment that had surrounded
the observation deck had disintegrated
into a rabble of individuals still pulling
themselves dazedly out of the wreck-
age or trapped in its midst.
Some of
them did seem to be orienting them-
selves and reorganizing, though. “We’d
better get out of the way!” Leen was
yelling.
She clearly was yelling, yet Shaa’s
hearing at the moment was also clearly
unequal to the task of comprehension
since meaning was lost behind a vast
ringing.
It was like old times.
Also
like old times was the usual leading
question - “Where’s Max?” Shaa said,

yelling himself. Max hadn’t been un-
der the platform when it had started to
drop, but he had been squarely in the
path of one burst of ﬁery debris.
Then Shaa felt a hand on his collar
yanking him to his feet. He swung on
the person behind him, his hand going
to the sword he was still wearing out
of habit in his belt, even though the
workout of actually employing it was
beyond him at present, but felt another
hand grab his arm and yank it behind
his back out of the way. The point of
someone else’s sword hung before his
face.
Manacles clanged behind him.
“Get them off this bridge!” someone
else was hollering.
“What is the meaning of this?” Shaa
asked reasonably. “The priority at the
moment would seem to be disaster re-
lief, not apprehending bystanders -”
“Shut up, scum!” the man with the

sword in his face said, and then he
whacked him over the side of the head
with the ﬂat of his blade for good mea-
sure. Next to Shaa, Leen was similarly
being dragged aside. If it was a case
of mistaken identity it would all be
straightened out in due time, unless
this was some sort of quarantine or
witchhunt.
But what if it wasn’t a
mistake?
Where was Max?
It wasn’t the blast; that much he
could have ridden with. No, it was ob-
viously more sheer bad luck. Although
it could have been worse.
If it had
been a twenty-pound chunk of ﬂying
pylon that had walloped Max in the
back, instead of probably only half as
much, the thing might very well have
overwhelmed his personal protection
ﬁeld and continued straight though his
spine to exit through his chest. As it

was, the projectile had merely knocked
the wind and momentary conscious-
ness out of him while smashing him to
the roadbed.
And leaving a good-sized indentation
in my back, too, Max thought dazedly.
He twisted, letting the piece of bridge
roll off his shoulders, and pushed him-
self to his hands and knees. For some
reason none of those trademark ﬂips
that would send him in one graceful
motion to his toe-tips seemed quite ac-
cessible at the moment. Max shook his
head. He should be trying to help res-
cue survivors, he should be -
Wait a minute.
That explosion
had been no accident.
Someone had
planned this ... those terrorists, that
must be it.
What if they had a fol-
lowup attack planned?
He should be
preparing ...
No, that wasn’t it.
Something was

nagging at his mind, something re-
maining perversely just out of his
grasp. On the ground in front of him,
Max noticed someone’s full head of hair
lying free of their body, with their hat
just beyond - some poor soul obviously
scalped by another fragment of ﬂying
debris.
Where was the victim?
- oh.
He really was dazed. The hair was the
wig from his own disguise, and the hat
the same, and now he noted that the
putty and greasepaint he’d applied to
his face had been scraped clean by his
encounter with the cobblestones.
There was certainly a lot of shout-
ing going on around him, even above
the shrieks of trapped victims and the
roar of the ﬁres and the bashing as
the bridge seemed to be pulling apart
behind him.
Where was Shaa - and
Leen! And Phlinn Arol had been atop
the grandstand, the Emperor too, and

who knew how many others.
None
of the voices sounded like anyone he
knew. Except possibly one, louder than
the rest, bellowing “There he is’” of all
things.
Something was waving in front of his
face. The point of a sword? Max looked
up. He was surrounded by a solid ring
of soldiers.
They were all pointing
swords at him. Then the two men in
front of him parted and let a new per-
son stride importantly out. Now Max
recognized him; it was the same per-
son who’d been shouting. “Maximillian
V’Dirapal,” said Gadol V’Nora, leader
of the Hand, “you are under arrest.”
“Arrest?” Max said groggily.
“On
what the hell kind of trumped-up
charge is it this time?”
Gadol’s thin smile grew somewhat
wider.
“That should be obvious.
You
should scarcely have begun consorting

with terrorists, much less advancing to
be their leader.”
Hands were relieving Max of his
sword, others were dragging him to
his feet, and now his arms were being
lashed behind his back. Through the
circle enclosing him he could now see
down the confused bridge toward the
shore, could see Shaa and Leen being
hustled toward the open door of a wait-
ing carriage by a similar detachment
of forces. He thought Leen might have
cast him a direct glance over her shoul-
der; regardless, though, it was ﬁnally
time to go into action. Max waggled his
ﬁngers to limber up and subvocalized
a triggerword –
BLAM! The blow to his head threw
him to the side. He would have gone
back to the ground if it hadn’t been for
the hands holding him upright and the
swords poking him in the back. Still,

someone had obviously had an arm
free to bash him with a mace. His own
hands were feeling cramped, conﬁned.
Gooey?
Another ﬁgure stepped into
view. “None of that, Max,” said Chas
V’Halila, the sorcerer. “You want me to
cast your mouth in plaster, too?”
Max glared at him, feeling the gooey
material encasing his ﬁngers harden
into stone.
Gadol was saying some-
thing about getting off the bridge, but
a ﬂicker of bright motion from off to
the left caught Max’s eye. Beyond the
bridge, heading down the river toward
them at a hefty clip, was - what? What
the hell was that?
This made no sense, no sense at all.
Leen might have not known Max very
well, or for very long, and she might
indeed have her own solid grievances
with him, and he might unquestion-
ably be involved in more than his

share of unlikely escapades, but be-
ing publicly associated with terrorists -
being publicly associated with anyone
- was clearly the direct opposite of his
style. Subterfuge in the shadows was
his mode of operation, intrigue behind
the scene.
On its face it made no sense, but that
only meant the surface was not the ap-
propriate level at which to look. What
else had -
Oh!
That broadsheet campaign!
Suddenly it did make sense - Max’s
enemy had resorted to a program of
character assassination to link him in
the public mind with the terrorists and
their depredations. That implied that
this enemy was associated with the
terrorists in some way, if they weren’t
actually the same. Max had served as
cover for the terrorists and their goals,
and Max was now being taken off the

playing board as an active factor.
But that was far too abstract.
As
the men dragged her toward the end
of the bridge, she could see Max back
over her shoulder and hear the taunts
of the leader of the band surrounding
him. Even if Max got away, he’d been
branded as the head of the terrorists -
and with such an outrageous act to his
credit as the one just accomplished he’d
be ripped to shreds by the ﬁrst crowd
that caught sight of his face. And if he
didn’t escape he’d clearly never leave
custody alive.
But what did she have to do with it -
and Shaa?
On the step up to the carriage she
paused, straining against the hands
shoving her inside for one last glance
backward. Max was still beset by his
captors. Off to the side, though, rising
out of the river, was a glinting white

wall. No, not a wall, a cliff - a moving
cliff. What could that -
But then the hands thrust harder.
Leen lost her balance and went sprawl-
ing after Shaa into the carriage.
A
set of outstretched legs kept her from
falling completely to the ﬂoor, although
she did manage to bang her head on
the opposite windowsill.
“Ah,” said the owner of the legs, “at
last you grace me with your personal
attention.”
The owner was not Shaa.
Leen
twisted and looked up.
“Don’t worry about old Maximillian,”
continued the Scapula. “He is in the
best of hands. As are you, my dear, and
of course my dear brother.”
It was trite and lame and stock,
she knew that, but it was the only re-
tort she could muster at the moment.
“What is the meaning of this?”

“Why, it’s all very simple,” said the
Scapula. “I’m about to get some good
news, and I thought the two of you
would like to help me celebrate.”
In for a penny, Karlini had ﬁgured,
when Haddo had asked him for his
backup against Dortonn, in for a pound.
But he hadn’t counted on anything like
this. Alone on the top of an iceberg in
the middle of the Running of Squids;
alone, that is, save for a pain-crazed
powerhouse of a sorcerer who obviously
didn’t care who else he took down with
him. For all his ﬂailing and trying to
stay out of the way, Karlini had still
had a leg ensnared by a looping tongue
of ice. The stuff he’d been hurling at
Dortonn had apparently not had full ef-
fect, either, unless Dortonn was being
uncharacteristically active for some-
one whose heart had stopped. With the
clinging ﬁre still eating at his skin, too,

and entombed as he was underneath
the sweep of ice, kidney and liver fail-
ure might not be Dortonn’s primary
worries at the moment, anyway.
If Karlini could get his leg free it
might be just as well to cut his losses
and leave the vicinity.
After all,
the navigation channel
wasn’t all that deep. If Dortonn’s ice-
berg kept growing, which it was clearly
doing now under its own self-feeding
chain reaction, it wouldn’t be long be-
fore it grounded itself. The grounding
wouldn’t be the real problem.
That
would be the brisk ﬂow-tide current
pushing against it, the current and its
tendency to tip the precarious iceberg
over on its side. Abruptly the iceberg
quivered violently, a high shrill grating
shriek radiating through its mass and
into the air. Karlini scrabbled for pur-
chase and held on, feeling as though

his bones were trying to pop their way
out from under his skin.
Then, in an act of signiﬁcant mercy,
the scraping stopped. The iceberg, how-
ever, did not.
It had cleared the mo-
mentary shoals. The fact that the ice-
berg had come that close to grounding
in the middle of the channel, though,
did not augur well for the future. Kar-
lini decided to let Dortonn stew on his
own and went to work on his leg. A few
shaped-charge blasts should crack the
ice sheet without losing him his foot...
A quick shadow passed over him,
and in the corner of his eye, a glinting
object. “Favored?” Karlini said.
The shiny object, a hufﬁng brass
sphere, banked around him and headed
away, trailing a string of white steam-
clouds in tight little balls.
“I could
use some help here, Favored,” called
Karlini.

The ball kept going.
The plug in Karlini’s ear popped and
hissed. “I just got a priority call from
the bridge,” Favored’s voice crackled.
Bridge? What bridge? “Favored! -”
Then the noises from the plug stopped
entirely.
Favored had cut him off.
The berg itself was busily creaking
and groaning, of course, a cacophony
Karlini’s present efforts against the
ice were only serving to increase, but
suddenly there was a new additional
sound, closer to hand and more reg-
ular; an added noise of cracking and
chipping. It was –
A hand appeared over the spire of
ice encasing the stern, then another
matching hand next to it,
bearing
a dagger.
The dagger plunged into
the ice with the same regular sound
- which was, of course, the sound of
someone cutting their way up a sheer

wall of ice. The associated head rose
into view between the hands. “I should
know by now that this kind of thing is
always happening around you people,”
said Svin.
“Uh, Svin?” Karlini called.
“Would
you give me a hand here?”
Svin, who had been looking down
through the ice at Dortonn, glanced up
at Karlini. His eyes widened. Karlini
squinted back at him, then twisted to
look back over his shoulder. His own
eyes went big, and his jaw dropped for
good measure.
Looming ahead of them was obvi-
ously Favored’s bridge.
The center
section, shrouded in ﬂames and oily
black smoke, was just slightly below
the level of Karlini’s present perch.
As he gaped at it, a section of wreck-
age tore free and went tumbling away
toward the surface of the water.

Actually, come to think of it, Karlini
thought he probably didn’t need Svin’s
help after all. He kicked violently, and
the ice encasing his leg, chipped and
abraded down already by his careful
employment of pulse-bursts, ﬂew off
in shards. His leg came free. The re-
leased force sent him rolling back on
his side, temporarily without a good
handhold, and as he skidded back-
ward on the slick ice sheet covering
the contorted roof of the houseboat,
the iceberg began to shudder again be-
neath him, even more vigorously than
the last time.
The peak whiplashed
forward. “Aah!-” Karlini began to yell.
Svin was too far away, though, and
Karlini already had too much momen-
tum. He felt the cold of the ice leave his
back and felt the rush of air in his face,
his stomach began to drop out from un-
der him, and as he continued to twist

in the air he caught a glimpse of the
surface of the water far too far below,
a group of dots that might be sea lions
scattering in confusion as the iceberg
bore down upon them.
What he needed to do was concen-
trate on spellcraft. His mind, though,
was perversely ﬁxating on the last time
he had found himself in mid-air over a
substantial body of water. The reﬂec-
tion was not encouraging. There was
no giant bird around this time to puck
him from the air.
Svin, used to working around ice
from his youth in terrain whose pri-
mary characteristic was frost, hung
on to his embedded dagger with one
hand and found purchase for the other
in a crevasse. The large tremor died.
The iceberg lurched forward again. Be-
neath him and ahead, though, the ice
was caving in. Svin eased himself back

and turned his head aside.
With his
face averted, the storm of jagged icicles
that suddenly erupted as the depres-
sion in the ice stopped collapsing and
instead blew out did no more than slice
the skin away from his neck and punc-
ture his ear, rather than putting out
an eye. The dagger began to shift and
his other hand was now clutching noth-
ing but a detached and crumbling ice
cube, and even though the pulverized
ice in the air had produced a sudden
whiteout Svin knew what lay at the
bottom of the fresh ice crater anyway,
so he ﬂung himself forward into the
hole, turned in the air, and did his best
to aim.
Tildy Mont had seen her share of
preposterous and overblown situations
since encountering the Karlinis and
their associates for the ﬁrst time, but
the present sequence clearly set some

new sort of record.
Not that she’d
found anyone she knew.
She’d just
kept making her way through the
crowd,
and then the proclamations
had started and the trumpets and
cheers, and so she’d settled for just
watching the aquatic procession from
the place she’d squeezed herself into
on the bridge.
But then the bridge had tried to blow
itself to pieces.
Tildy was far off to the side, merely
on the abutment, really, so she hadn’t
been hurt; more just shaken up.
In
the relative still after the blasts, the
cries and screams of the people fur-
ther along had come clearly through,
though, and then people started to
stampede in every direction and she
was caught up and spun around in
the press.
She couldn’t see a thing
except the rioting people immediately

around her, and then the dust rose and
the smoke from the explosions drifted
over and she realized that she was in
danger of being trampled to paste on
the pavement if she happened to trip,
so instead of being dragged along she
tried to thrust her own way free. Was
she still on the bridge? Was she back
on land? There was no way to tell. She
felt an unfamiliar desire to scream ...
She clamped down on it and forged
ahead. Then suddenly there was day-
light ahead, and a gap in the mob,
and a crew of police or troops or some-
body ofﬁcial trying to sort things out
and channel the ﬂow and generally set
things back in order. Tildy burst into
the open. She was off the bridge - back
on that main street, in fact. The police
were forcing open a lane for trafﬁc. A
closed carriage swept off the bridge
as she watched, swerved to miss an

oncoming wagon crowded with more
police, and rattled off at high speed
down the boulevard.
Suddenly a new shadow loomed over
her - a man, in a silver and black outﬁt
with a cape. Her breath froze -
Oh,
come on,
Tildy told herself.
You’re not the ﬂuttery sort. But there
was no denying she was on edge -
“This is not a healthy place to be,”
the man said to her. “May I escort you
home?”
Tildy forced her heart back out of her
throat again as she realized that the
voice was familiar. He was ... he was
that guy she’d met at the club, the one
who was so interested in her, the one
who, well -
But whether she’d liked him or not
was beside the point at the moment. It
might be better to have help getting
clear of this mess. “Thank you,” Tildy

told him. “That would be great.”
Suddenly he was sweeping her along,
a strong hand on her arm. “Unfortu-
nately my vehicle is in use, so we will
have to walk,” the man said. “Let us
ﬁrst get away from this vicinity and
then you will give me directions.”
“Thank you,” she was babbling again.
Tildy forced her mouth shut.
If you
can’t talk intelligently, she told her-
self, don’t. There was nothing to worry
about now, not with this man at her
side.
Although, relieved or not, she did
have to admit he was looking even
more attractive now than he had the
other evening.
Again a wave washed over his head.
Again? How was he alive, then, and not
drowned? Assuming he was alive. But
he must be alive - death could hardly
be this unpleasant.

He was in the middle of a paroxysm
of coughing. Not just from the water,
either, he realized. He was sick to his
stomach. He wasn’t by any means the
only thing the water had ﬂoating in it.
Shaa had warned him against the wa-
ter, and especially the Tongue, and yet
here he was ﬂoating in something, and
he had been for - for who knew how
long?
Jurtan Mont ﬂailed around with his
arms. One hand hit a squishy embank-
ment rising up out of the horrid water.
That was it, Jurtan realized.
He’d
fallen through that pit into an inlet
off the Tongue waterfront, but instead
of going full into the water he’d hung
up on the edge, on that mudbank. A
mudbank that people apparently used
as a convenient place to dump their
sewage. Now the water was being ag-
itated by these waves and the bank

had been undermined, precipitating
him into the water and ﬁnally waking
him up. Just then another wave rolled
through, shoving Jurtan up against
the mud and letting him slide, thor-
oughly slimed again, back down.
He’d never make it up that incline.
The thing was totally unstable - he’d
risk bringing down a mudslide that
would bury him once and for all. Ju-
rtan’s head throbbed horridly, he was
on the verge of throwing up, not (he
was sure) for the ﬁrst time, on top of
that he felt wretchedly queasy ... but
the waves weren’t the only reason he’d
woken up.
Music was pounding full
force in his skull; music telling him to
get going, and fast.
A glimmer of light showed ahead,
illuminating the curve of a semicircle
three times as tall as he was.
Jur-
tan launched himself toward it.
For

a moment he could touch bottom, a
bottom even squishier than the slope
behind him, and laden with clinging
sea-grass and vines, but then the sur-
face dropped mercifully away and he
was fully paddling. This was actually
a culvert, Jurtan recognized, and up
ahead should be -
The largest wave yet came spilling
around the corner. Jurtan felt himself
lifted, pressed against the top of the
culvert, scraped ahead as the space
ﬁlled entirely with water...
Then he
was dropping again.
Jurtan kicked
madly and dug in with his arms, try-
ing to ride the ebb tide back out, felt
himself bash off the wall as the cur-
rent dragged him around a corner -
but now that was full sunlight was up
ahead. Another moment brought him
through.
Off to the right a forest of pilings sig-

naled the start of the wharves.
The
long shadow to the left and the stone
island ahead announced the presence
of that big bridge. Beyond the island
and its stout vertical pier some kind
of large gray smooth-skinned ﬁsh were
leaping clear of the water and dancing
backward on their tails. Behind them
was the much larger bulk of a lumber-
ing whale. From his vantage point low
in the water himself he could see the
superstructure of a small boat cutting
back and forth ahead of the leviathan.
But Jurtan wasn’t here for sight-
seeing. The music was urging him on
- on, and up. Behind him the bank of
the Tongue Water was faced with a
heavy stone wall linked to the shore-
ward arch of the bridge. Was there a
stairway, or a ladder? There was a lad-
der, and a ﬂoating landing-stage at its
base. Both were crowded with people,

people hanging on the rungs, people
shouting and waving, people - jumping
in?
They’d spotted him!
They were
coming after him.,.
no, they weren’t.
They weren’t waving and pointing in
his direction, either. Jurtan broke his
awkward stroke long enough to cast
a glance back over his shoulder. Now,
looking further up, he saw what his
ﬁrst cursory inspection had missed.
The center span of the bridge was in
ﬂames.
Stones and girders and un-
recognizable chunks of wreckage were
pouring toward the water in the path
of the leviathan.
And people, people
too. Could he help?
The music roared at him.
That
wasn’t what it had in mind.
There
was something more important going
on? The music was weaving multiple
themes and melodic lines together in
a dark tapestry; Jurtan could recog-

nize Max’s motif, and Shaa’s, and his
sister’s, and... What was going on out
there?
By the time he reached the landing-
stage a few moments later it had emp-
tied enough for him to pull himself
from the water and grab for the ladder
without having to shove anyone out of
the way.
Not that he’d have had the
strength to push through a crowd, but
then again the music was quite serious
about egging him on. Just behind Jur-
tan a dory was putting in with a cargo
of people pulled from the water; above
him, though, a line of people hanging
onto the ladder were helping to guide
him up, regardless of his slime-caked
clothes and thoroughly subhuman ap-
pearance.
More quickly than he would have
expected Jurtan was collapsing over
the top of the seawall onto a short

riverwalk stretching beneath the ﬁ-
nal arch of the bridge.
He found his
feet and shambled ahead. Now people
were falling back from him; now, catch-
ing a whiff of his own scent, Jurtan
would have fallen back from himself,
if possible.
A broad stair beyond the
arch led up to the bridge, though. His
shoes were sliding and slurching on the
pavement, and the slick stone of the
stairway was even worse; he did fall,
halfway up, smashing both knees into
the edge of the step and scraping the
fresh scabs off his palms. He wobbled
to his feet and lurched onward.
The top of the broad staircase formed
an even broader plaza which merged
on the side with the road where it
ﬂowed off the bridge. As he came off
the last stair and tried to get a ﬁx
on whatever the music was trying to
tell him, a carriage tore past heading

from the bridge into the city. A strange
sense of disorientation gripped Jur-
tan - but, no, that had to have been
yesterday that he’d chased after that
carriage the ﬁrst time. He took a step
after the coach and then paused.
It was the same carriage. The theme
he’d
heard
yesterday
that
had
at-
tracted his attention to the vehicle,
though, the one belonging to that guy
Tildy had been spending time with at
the club, was absent. The man wasn’t
in the carriage.
He was hearing that person’s mo-
tif, however. He was hearing a whole
bunch of them. Max’s was coming from
his right, and Shaa’s from the left, and
-
What did the music want him to do?
It had to -
But no, it didn’t. The music didn’t
know. There was too much happening;

Jurtan’s internal senses couldn’t ﬁgure
out what was most important.
They
were leaving it up to him.
Tildy’s theme ﬂoated in from the left
too, and weaving through it the sinis-
ter slidehorn snarl of the man from the
carriage. Jurtan swung in that direc-
tion and headed after them.
Favored swooped low over the twisted
grandstand. Sections were still collaps-
ing onto the lower deck, and through
the lower deck toward the river, but
here and there small knots of people
were extricating themselves from the
wreckage, and a detachment of res-
cuers was working its way in from the
west end of the bridge.
At least two
sorcerers were at work as well trying
to damp down the ﬁres and stabilize
the structure before the whole cen-
ter span of the bridge gave way.
No
one had taken the time to squash the

terrorists’ message, however, and the
ﬂaming letters and sigils were still
casting a ﬂickering red wash over the
rising clouds and the smoky pall below.
Smoke should not a major concern
to him, though, or more precisely to
Flotarobolis. Favored brought the ve-
hicle to a hover at about twice head-
height for a tall human and went into
a slow tracking spin. Fortunately he’d
brought the ﬂyer along in the wagon;
it never hurt to be prepared. But pre-
pared for what? Who’d sent out that
call?
It had to be a god, no one else
could have -
“You - Favored-of-the-Gods -” came
a shouting voice. There he was, wav-
ing at Flotarobolis, standing erect atop
what might have started the festivities
as a table of refreshments, covered in
soot and grime, a dark stain that might
be blood dripping down his side.
Fa-

vored ﬂoated toward him. “Hurry up!”
the god snapped. “I am requisitioning
your vehicle.”
“You couldn’t ﬁt inside it,” Favored
yelled back through the speaking-tube,
“and you couldn’t ﬂy it if you could!”
“Of course,” the god said impatiently.
“I am requisitioning you too.”
I had no idea how long I’d been
swimming in mist.
For all I knew it
had been days.
I didn’t know either
when - if ever - I’d decide to come back
out. It didn’t bother me much one way
or the other. It felt like a lot of thinking
of some sort was going on, but it was
happening somewhere in the neighbor-
hood, not right in my own head where
I could get at it.
It was more like
someone across the room was having a
conversation that I couldn’t quite hear
than a discussion I was involved in

myself.
All of which sounded to me like a
pretty solid picture of somebody going
ﬁrmly and quite unequivocally out of
his mind.
But like I said, I didn’t much care.
Maybe the sensation of crossing the di-
vide from moderate inebriation to total
anesthetization of the brain was -
“It is time to get up,” someone was
saying.
Someone? Well, yes, I guess so, ex-
cept the “someone” happened to be me.
At least it was my voice, although I
didn’t remember asking it to speak
up just then.
“Just a second,” I said.
“What -”
All of a sudden the mist was gone.
Around me was still the wreckage of
my room at the Adventurers’ Club.
From the fact that the dust had largely
settled and everything that had been

on the verge of falling over or apart had
made its decision and was now resting
in fragments further littering the ﬂoor,
it could have been hours or days since
the last time I’d been conscious. I’d not
only gotten cleaned up from the battle
and my encounter with the pit, I found
myself dressed in a different outﬁt, too,
obviously ready to go out.
This was clearly a new slant on ways
to be productive while you were asleep.
Except I hadn’t been sleeping, had I?
Or was it that part of me had been up
and active while another part of me -
“There is only so much of this enter-
tainment I have time for,” I said, with
a decided sneer. “It is too bad to hurry
things after this long, but -”
“Who are you?” I interrupted.
I chuckled again, that same nasty
cackle I’d heard before. I chuckled? No,
he chuckled. But how could there be

“me” and “him?” There was only one
of us.
Wasn’t there?
“Who are you?”
he said, and then broke into another
cackling roll.
“Why don’t you tell me that?” I
thought at him.
“Who I am or who you are? No mat-
ter, you don’t want to know either one.”
Well, he was right in a way; I didn’t
but I did.
But in the same way I didn’t know
who he was, but I did.
Or at least I
almost did. The knowledge was down
there, bubbling slowly up toward full
comprehension. Then -
“You’re Iskendarian,” I said. “Right?”
Which meant I was Iskendarian, sort
of, which meant - which meant I’d have
to sort it all out later.
“But you in-
vented the Spell of Namelessness, or
something like that, didn’t you?
So
how could you let yourself be - unless

you -”
“Of course, you dolt. I used it on my-
self.”
Of course. He’d wanted to disappear,
totally and completely.
What better
way than to be dead?
He’d spread
around the story he was dead, and to
keep anyone from ﬁnding him by probe
he’d cast his own custom spell on him-
self before going into hibernation; cast
his spell and shifted his physical ap-
pearance too no doubt. Then when he’d
woken up he’d used me as a false front
to disguise himself from the world and
as a hiding place to put his capabilities
back together. He’d been peeking out
every so often to check up on events
and he’d stepped in when magic had
needed to be employed. He’d -
“I made you,” he said, in a tone that
clearly stated that our conversation
was coming to a close.
“Now your

usefulness is done.
And there is at
present a window of opportunity I do
not choose to miss.”
“Wait a -” I said, but he didn’t. The
headache exploded out through my
mind. I hung on to the fragments of my
consciousness - I would have shouted,
except he had control of our mouth; I
would have fallen to the ﬂoor, except
I’d lost control of our body; hopefully
I at least managed to vomit, although
I wouldn’t have known it if I had; I
would have...

Chapter26
THERE WAS STILL NO GIANT
BIRD, the Great Karlini observed. He
had half-expected that the bird, given
as it was to melodramatic gestures,
would have chosen just this moment to
make its entrance, triumphant from its
stay at the ancestral breeding grounds.
But apparently not. Now Favored had
walked out on him too, and there was
no one else in sight between his plum-
meting body and the surface of the

water coming up at him now quite
rapidly, no one except of course for one
of the namesake guests of honor of
the festival now cruising through his
probable point of touchdown.
It was
probably too much to expect for a ﬂail-
ing tentacle to pluck him from the air...
wasn’t it?
If only he hadn’t always been so
quick to lump levitation with transmu-
tation of metals and perpetual motion
in the “useless” bin reserved for the
old wives’ tales of sorcery, perhaps he
might have been able to come up with
something. Unfortunately it seemed a
little late at the moment to be -
A shadow passed overhead. Had Fa-
vored returned? No - and it wasn’t one
shadow, either, it was a bunch of them.
Not a giant bird, but a ﬂock of small
ones?
Screeching madly, the birds dove on

him.
Beaks and claws closed on ev-
ery available edge of clothing, on feet,
hands, hair, on -
Karlini’s stomach ﬂipped again as
his rush toward the surface abruptly
paused. He was rising - no, actually he
wasn’t, he was still falling, but more
slowly and under some semblance of
control.
Feathers were drifting down
past his nose, the sound of frenzied
ﬂapping surrounded him, wings beat
his back and thrust gusts of winds
along his side - but he was still falling.
They were only small birds, after all;
they were... seagulls?
Of course, Karlini thought, totally
dazed, what else? An exhausted bird
peeled free and soared off in a long
glide, then another nosed over at his
feet and dropped head-ﬁrst toward the
water.
The squid was off to the side
now and up ahead, waving its ten-

tacles regally at the Imperial grand-
stand, where from the look of things no
one was paying the slightest attention.
“Can we make shore?” Karlini asked,
but just at that moment a particularly
loud squawk blared at him from about
six inches overhead, and with a chorus
of relieved wails the ﬂock of seagulls
let him go.
They had released raggedly. Karlini
found himself turning a deranged mid-
air cartwheel, legs and arms sprawled
in every direction, but he was barely
becoming aware of the situation when
he hit the surface of the water and
went through in a shower of foam.
Something squishy went “ooph” be-
neath Svin’s feet as he landed in the
bottom of the ice crater. Svin crouched
low, dagger at the ready, and peered
through the haze of pulverized ice.
“You are Dortonn of the north?” Svin

demanded.
The man immobilized beneath him
opened a bleary eye and gazed up past
his sagging eyelid. “Who are you?” he
wheezed. Then he made a hollow rattly
sound deep in his throat. “But I don’t
care. Just end it.”
Truly Dortonn was battered.
The
exploding ring and the clinging ﬁre
had done their work, and indeed the
ﬁre was still licking at one charred
arm and a bare section of chest.
It
would clearly be the honorable thing to
dispatch this creature from his misery.
But would it also be the wisest? If
Svin thought he’d learned anything, it
was not to waste the possibility of infor-
mation about what really might be hap-
pening. Then there was the question
of the current tactical situation to con-
sider, too. “Can you stop this iceberg?”
Svin said.

The eye goggled at him as though
he was out of his mind.
“My powers
are drained,” Dortonn stated.
“I am
drained.”
“That is no excuse,” Svin told him.
Suddenly he was standing not on Dor-
tonn’s belly but at his side, and almost
in the same blurred instant Dortonn
had been slung over his shoulder with
one of Svin’s large hands wrapped
securely around his neck.
As Svin
crouched again and sprang forcefully
up the side of the crater, he noted that
Dortonn had found enough strength
for a weak wail... and then they had
cleared the crater’s lip. The frost cloud
had settled enough to see the looming
structure ahead. “You can still become
even less comfortable,” Svin suggested.
Dortonn’s eye rolled, absorbed the
scene, and abruptly widened.
The
hand that had not worn the ring, which

was still signiﬁcantly more intact than
the other contorted claw, began ges-
turing. A strange word bubbled in his
throat.
I gradually became aware that I was
gradually becoming aware.
Thinking
straight was still a highly problematic
proposition since my head still felt
like someone with a large lead mal-
let was trying to play it like a bell, in
pace with each heartbeat, but I wasn’t
about to complain. With his last nasty
move, Iskendarian had made it sound
as though he was doing away with me
for good. The fact that he’d pulled his
punch, or maybe that I’d proved a lit-
tle more tenacious than he’d allowed
for, was enough to hang onto for the
moment.
I wasn’t about to ask him
about it either, especially since he was
showing no sign he realized I was still

in the vicinity.
Of course, it wasn’t surprising my
head felt like it was going to explode; it
had to be pretty crowded with two of us
in there. On the other hand, I wasn’t
sure it was our head that was hurt-
ing, per se. I couldn’t actually feel the
rest of our body, and sight and hearing
were pretty erratic too. On the whole,
it seemed as though I’d been wadded
up and shoved away in the attic.
Not that I was thinking of just giv-
ing up and going to sleep. No, I would
have been happy to do something about
the situation, except I couldn’t think of
what. I couldn’t hit him over the head;
he was controlling our arms. I couldn’t
knock him over, unless I could pull off
some kind of commando attack on our
center of balance and rely on him to
trip. I didn’t even seem to be able to
give him back the headache he’d given

me.
I wasn’t overhearing any of his
thoughts, either.
From the fact that
he wasn’t trying to eradicate me again
I hoped that also meant he couldn’t de-
tect mine. Even if I couldn’t tell what
he was thinking, though, he was obvi-
ously up to something. He was striding
down a winding street, then turning a
corner without hesitation, then charg-
ing straight through an intersection
with only the barest glance at the road
sign.
The trafﬁc seemed surprisingly
sparse. I was wondering where every-
one had gone, until it occurred to me
that perhaps I had been unconscious
for a day or two before Iskendarian had
roused me, and that everyone might al-
ready be down at the waterfront for
the Running of the Squids.
I
decided
to
concentrate
harder;
maybe I could pick up his thoughts

if I really pushed myself at them.
It
might have been my imagination, but
it occurred to me that he was consider-
ing how to go about taking the gods up
on their offer to make us their chief if
we got rid of Max. Of course, it could
have been my imagination, but it was
also totally consistent with what I’d
seen of Iskendarian’s personality so
far.
As I concentrated, though, I might
not have only been receiving emana-
tions from Iskendarian. I had enough
of a rapport with Monoch to know he
was up to something, too. What it was
I couldn’t tell; that obviously was the
story of my day. Monoch was probably
transferring his allegiance to the new
boss, I wouldn’t be surprised. Monoch
seemed to be as unaware of me as Isk-
endarian. If he was throwing in with
Iskendarian,
that was undoubtedly

just as well.
We
had
entered
another
cobble-
stoned street lined with small ware-
houses and strange thaumaturgical
signs, and Iskendarian had started
looking at the numbers on the build-
ings, when I suddenly realized where
we were. I hadn’t been there myself but
I knew the address - and sure enough,
that was it. His hand made a few quick
gestures, something sparkling lit up
the locks, and then they all clicked si-
multaneously as their bolts withdrew.
He pushed open the door and stepped
in.
The lamps and wizard lights were
dark and gloom hung over the inte-
rior.
At the end of a short wall was
an open two-story room. Iskendarian
had his head cocked to the side, clearly
listening with more than ears.
Then
he stepped ahead, apparently satisﬁed,

and we were standing in the Karlini
workroom.
Another
gesture
brought
up
the
hanging wizard lights. “Where would
she be keeping them?” Iskendarian
muttered,
gazing around the room.
“Surely not in plain sight?
But what
is this?” He strode across to a work
table strewn with old papers, next to a
bookcase overﬂowing with more. I felt
him smile. “Ah!” he said, and started
quickly gathering them up.
He stopped for a moment, gazing
at the top sheet in his hand.
“Good,
good, exactly as I’d hoped,” he mut-
tered, and as he said this I realized I
understood what was happening. Isk-
endarian hadn’t been certain all his
memory and skills would survive his
hibernation so he’d written out the
story of his life and plans, and he’d left
himself instructions.

Max had done him the favor of mak-
ing sure the stuff was right at hand.
Iskendarian was adding another sheaf
from the bookcase to the tall pile he’d
assembled on the table when his eyes
fell on a nearby blackboard.
“What’s
this?” he murmured. “Interesting, very
interesting.
A worthwhile extension.
Perhaps -”
“Who is it?” said a woman’s voice
from the top of the staircase at the side
of the room. “Oh, it’s you. But what
are you doing here?”’
I threw everything into it.
I had
to try to warn her - all it would take
would be a peep, half-a-second’s con-
trol of our vocal cords, that wasn’t ask-
ing for much, but Iskendarian never
ﬂinched. I heard him mouth, “So much
the better,” and raise his arm.
Roni was going into her strike mode,
but she wasn’t a ﬁeld operator, and

even if she had been she wasn’t Isk-
endarian. Even penned up in the back
of my brain and comatose for however
long it had been, he still had the power
of legions at his ﬁngertips. A ﬁreball
blasted across the room and tore into
the staircase and blew it apart.
The
wall behind it crashed out and the ceil-
ing above fell in. The next story above
started to follow it down in a rain of
screeching wood, the tall barrels be-
neath the staircase burst their staves
and gushed forth jets and waves of oily
iridescent liquid, blast waves rolled
past us - and I couldn’t see Roni. She’d
vanished in the center of the ball of
ﬂame.
“Goddamn,” I thought. “He’s killed
her.”
“Were you responsible for that disas-
ter back there?” Zalzyn Shaa asked his
brother as the coach continued jounc-

ing along.
“One cannot bear all the world’s
calamities on one’s own shoulder,” said
his brother. “You of all people should
know that.”
“I assume that means you don’t in-
tend to answer the question.”
“He’s always been like this,” the
Scapula told Leen in a calmly reason-
able tone.
“Were you behind that massacre?”
said Leen.
“I am behind, as you put it, quite a
lot,” Arznaak acknowledged. “But I, a
terrorist? Surely not - I am a force for
order. Your friend Max, on the other
hand, was clearly implicated -”
“You may have me chained up,” Shaa
inserted, “you are most certainly up to
something nefarious,
but you don’t
have to make me listen to this.”
“What about the Emperor?” Leen

asked. “Did anyone see what happened
to the Emperor?”
The Scapula gazed idly out the win-
dow. “Phlinn went after him, good old
Phlinn. That is his kind of job, anyway.”
He shrugged. “Who knows? Perhaps
Phlinn even rescued him, and survived
himself in the bargain.
Regardless,
rest assured he behaved in a manner
archetypally beﬁtting an archetypal
god of heroes. Ah, here we are, home
at last.”
The carriage had indeed clattered to
a halt. An attendant was opening the
door, with behind him a serious contin-
gent of guards. “Show our guests in,”
the Scapula instructed.
“Has anyone
else arrived? Not yet? Well, he should
be along momentarily.” With an ener-
getic spring he bounded from his seat
into the courtyard. As Leen and Shaa
were being dragged, less comfortably,

from the cab, Arznaak suddenly turned
back.
“You are awake,” he addressed
his brother, “so you are certainly con-
templating some bold move.
Before
you act so as to quixotically accelerate
your own death you might consider
a truth your friend Maximillian has
always failed to appreciate.”
“And that truth is?” Shaa said.
“Why, that not every problem has a
solution, of course.”
“Have you noticed that a gigantic
iceberg is heading straight toward us?”
Max remarked.
“You are reduced to this?” smirked
Gadol V’Nora. “Such an old trick? No,
Maximillian. You -”
Max shrugged as much as possible,
given the number of hands still holding
him.“Well, don’t say I didn’t try to warn
you,” he said.

“If you -” Gadol began, but he broke
off as something swooped toward them
from the ruined section of the bridge,
something round and shiny and trail-
ing gouts of steam. Clanking madly, it
made an erratic leap and gained per-
haps ﬁve feet of altitude, then equally
abruptly reversed course and dropped
back toward the roadbed.
Atop the
reeling prodigy was sprawled a human
form clutching frantically for purchase.
Just when it seemed the thing would
surely crash into their midst a fresh
steam cloud enveloped it.
When the
cloud shredded, the contraption was
bounding again into the sky.
“Read the formal indictment and
let’s get him out of here,” said Chas,
the magician, looking after the appari-
tion with a clear expression of disbelief.
Gadol turned back from the retreat-
ing vapor trail and favored Chas with

a brief frown. “Very well. In our power
as Special Auxiliary to the Municipal-
ity of Peridol I arrest you in their name
for -”
“What’s that?” one of the Hand’s
troopers interrupted. “That big white
-”
Every head in the group swiveled to
follow the man’s pointing arm. Every
head, that is, except one. Max threw
himself back and around, ripping free
of the restraining hands through the
element of forceful surprise, put his
head down, and charged the gap be-
tween two of the Hand.
They spun
away under the impact just far enough
for Max to plunge on through. The low
wall at the margin of the bridge was
just beyond. Did he really want to do
this, with his hands still frozen in a
block of stone behind his back? Did he
have a -

A titanic spine-rattling teeth-clenchin
screeching scraping sound came up
from behind, and then with an equally
loud crunch and THOMP! the bridge
jerked out from under him. Max, still
in forward ﬂight, felt his footing vanish.
He cartwheeled ahead, barely cleared
the railing at the upside-down limit
of his somersault, and went over the
side.
In the brief glimpse he caught
behind him before beginning his drop
toward the water below, Max saw sev-
eral things of particular interest. The
part of the iceberg he could see had
fractured into a collection of boulder-
sized ice fragments that were even
now cascading onto the roadbed and
careening across it, knocking people
aside like tenpins.
Overhead above
the toppling ice cubes, caught in the
midst of a prodigious leap from what a
moment before had been the top of the

iceberg, was a mightily thewed ﬁgure
with another dangling person slung
over his shoulder.
Max tumbled toward the water. For-
tunately he had a second quantum
level force burst pre-prepared for emer-
gencies, and on voice trigger too. He
began to subvocalize the release se-
quence -
Something slapped him across the
back and knocked the wind out of him.
No, not merely a slap, whatever-it-was
was wrapping itself around his body. A
hurling net - the edges weighted with
bolo plumbs, the mesh slathered with
some clinging adhesive, the -
Max hit the water. His mouth still
open, he gulped ﬂuid; his arms and
legs securely swaddled and his hands
still weighted down by Chas’ clay block,
he began to sink. He could barely even
writhe...

But something was hauling at his
feet.
One of the Running leviathans,
some carnivore of the sea? No - a cast-
ing line was attached to the net.
He
was being drawn in. A gaff caught on
the webbing behind his back, then an-
other one near his ankles; they yanked
together, and he came free of the water
into the air.
Max coughed, retched, hacked -
“Oh, come now, Maximillian,” said a
man standing over him.
“Forget the
show.”
Max spat up a ﬁnal gout of water and
opened his eyes. He was sprawled on a
ﬂatboat. Several men around him were
nailing corners of the net to the deck.
“You always were the smartest Hand,”
Max stated, and coughed again.
Romm V’Nisa put his hands on his
hips. “It was prudent to anticipate you
would attempt to reach the water.
I

would have.”
“Thanks,
teacher,” Max told him.
Beyond the ﬂatboat, what remained
of the iceberg with its top lopped off
had come to a stop partway under the
bridge.
The sliced-ﬂat upper surface
had wedged itself beneath the dam-
aged section of the center span, where
it now appeared to be serving as an
effective, if temporary, splint.
“Since Gadol surely failed,” Romm
said, “I should pronounce the indict-
ment. Maximillian V’Dirapal, I arrest
you under the authority and in the
name of...”
The Great Karlini ﬁnished crawling
from the water onto the ledge at the
base of the bridge pier and collapsed
on his face. “Thanks,” he managed. “I
know I couldn’t have done this without
you.”

Behind him, the bottle-nosed sea
mammal that had towed him from
the channel nuzzled him again and
made another comment in its high-
pitched squeaky voice.
The creature
had dragged him out of the way of the
iceberg with not too much time left to
spare. As far as Karlini was concerned,
though, it was time for a vacation. The
world could go on with its plots without
him for -
A scream split his head from the
inside out. Karlini jackknifed convul-
sively up, his ears ringing as the shriek
cut suddenly off, even though he knew
his ears hadn’t actually been what had
done the hearing. The low-level back-
of-the-mind link they’d maintained for
so long he’d barely thought about it
in years had exploded with so much
agonal force that -
Karlini looked miserably across the

intervening water at the city-side sea-
wall and its crowded staircase, then
sighed and jumped back in the water.
With a cry like that he knew he’d be
too late - he was too late already - but
he had to know. Roni -
“Why is this vehicle so slow?” yelled
Gashanatantra. “And so unstable,” he
added, as the brass ball beneath him
suddenly quivered, rolled, and lurched
again toward the ground.
For an in-
stant the top was the side, and he was
hanging over a ﬁve-story drop with
only his precarious grip on a protrud-
ing circulation vent saving him from
entering free-fall above the pavement.
“It’s not designed for this!” honked
the speaking-tube.
“You could just
land and commandeer a wagon.”
“Shut up and ﬂy! Time is critical!”
“Then
you
might
have
planned
ahead for your transportation,” mut-

tered Favored. Another block of ﬂats
slid past below them in a reasonably
straight diagonal line.
“I didn’t think he would move so
fast,” Gash said grudgingly,
almost
to himself.
His head was cocked to
the side as though he was listening to
something not in the immediate vicin-
ity. “Or with so much force. Faster!” he
repeated. They were still too far out of
range ...
Behind us echoed a despairing wail.
Iskendarian turned.
He’d been con-
templating the scene in front of us for
what had felt to me like minutes but
had probably been only a second or two.
Atop the vista of exploding ﬁre and col-
lapsing woodwork had been added the
glittering meshwork of spells going off,
scooping up and channeling the broth
gushing from the vats through overlap-

ping balls glowing azure and aquama-
rine. As his vision shifted, though, it
became apparent that the destruction
was thus far limited to the corner of
the building he’d struck.
The entry
hall was still intact.
Backlit by the
light from the street and tinted danc-
ing red by the ﬂames was the open-
mouthed ﬁgure of Tildamire Mont,
chest heaving from her run through
the front door Iskendarian had left
unlocked, the horriﬁed anguish on her
face clearly visible.
Beneath Iskendarian’s arm was the
stack of paperwork he’d gathered up,
and in that hand Monoch the walking
stick, but that still left the other arm
free. He raised it and pointed it at the
girl. I could feel the power crackle as
he spoke the trigger-word –
Another person dove in through the
open door, snatched Tildamire away

with one arm, carried her to the ﬂoor
with him off to the side, and hugged
the boards, covering her with his body
as the entry hall erupted into ﬂame.
“Isn’t there anything you can do
about this?” Leen hissed at Shaa.
“I can see what develops,” Shaa told
her. “You might choose to do the same.
You don’t look too uncomfortable.”
Indeed, he was the one chained to
the wall.
Leen was merely tied to a
chair, and an overstuffed armchair at
that. Of course, unlike a straight-back
chair, the armchair would be impos-
sible to lift with oneself and move,
and the deep cushion gave exactly the
wrong leverage to try to manipulate
oneself to one’s feet. “This is no dun-
geon, either,” he added.
“You don’t
have to worry about rats.” Shaa hes-
itated, then went ahead, addressing
his words to the man across the room.

“Also, I swore an oath.”
Arznaak didn’t bother to turn to face
him, instead continuing to busy him-
self clinking glasses at the sideboard.
He waved his free hand idly; it was a
matter of little signiﬁcance. “Then I ab-
solve you of it.”
“That is one thing you can’t do. The
oath was to Dad, not you, as you know
quite well.”
Arznaak leaned back against the
sideboard, twirling a snifter in his
hand.
He raised into position for a
toast. “To Dad, who isn’t around, t’sk
t’sk. Very well then, it’s your choice. If
you want to consider this a convenient
excuse to prepare for suicide, be my
guest.”
“How can you two be acting this
way?” Leen sputtered.
They both opened their mouths to
provide each his own dryly barbed re-

joinder, but just then a new person
appeared in the doorway.
“Ah,” said
the Scapula, “the true guest of honor.”
“I have it,” Jardin panted.
“I have
it at last. He went through with our
bargain, the fool human.”
“What bargain?” said Shaa, his voice
much ﬂatter than usual.
“In
time,”
his
brother
told
him.
“Bring it here, then, my friend.”
Jardin dragged himself across the
room. His shoulders were sagging, he
was carrying himself stifﬂy as though
he was covered with bruises, his sling-
supported arm was clearly weighing
him down, even his voice lacked en-
ergy; he radiated comprehensive and
thorough exhaustion.
Who has he
fallen afoul of? Shaa wondered. Had
Jardin’s reverses, whatever they had
been, caused him to make the bargain
he’d mentioned? Jardin reached into a

pocket and held up a ring.
“Keeping your jaw dropped in such
a manner lacks decorum, my brother,”
chided Arznaak. “Now -”
“Now you will examine this ring,”
Jardin ordered.
“Very well,” said the Scapula.
He
caressed the air above Jardin’s hand,
closed his eyes -
“I thought you had very little ad-
vanced training,” Shaa observed.
“If
anyone here is examining anything it
should be me.”
Arznaak sighed and made another
pass. “Unfortunately my brother has
his own agendas. It would be foolish to
trust him. I -”
“Does he know?” said Jardin.
“Also in time; everything in its time.
Jardin, this ring is clean.
Maximil-
lian’s trivial safeguards will fall away
before your mighty power.”

“If you’re lying I’ll eat your heart,”
Jardin said, took the ring from his
palm, and slipped it onto his ﬁnger.
What had he wandered into? With
Max out of circulation, his plan would
have left the way clear to pursue his
added goal of insinuating himself into
the
company
of
Max’s
compatriots.
There were undoubtedly secrets in
their midst ripe for the taking, infor-
mation that would help him position
himself against his own patron.
The
girl had been an obvious target, and
she had been fulﬁlling her ordained
role with remarkable precision. With
everyone else in Max’s organization
out at the Running - who would be
anywhere else? - it had seemed a per-
fect opportunity to raid their facility.
Tildamire could get him through the
defenses and reveal through her enam-

ored talk any caches of hidden worth
-
But then where had Spilkas come
from, and where had he developed
such destructive power - and why was
he using it?
And why had he looked
so nasty, too, in the brief glimpse Frad-
jikan had had of him as he’d dove
through the door?
Fradi knew he should have turned
around and left the vicinity as quickly
as possible at the ﬁrst sight of this
scene. Instead, he’d acted on impulse.
Yes, he’d saved the girl, for the moment,
but that only meant that Spilkas would
try to ﬁnish the job with the next blow.
They had to get out -
Except the doorway they’d just used
to enter was now a solid cauldron of
ﬂame, and the ceiling above was com-
ing down on their heads. There were
no side exits.
The only way out was

ahead, straight toward Spilkas. There
was nothing to be gained by waiting.
Fradi came to a low crouch and ﬂung
himself weaving down the hall.
Was he the cavalry?
Whatever his
secrets were, whatever he’d thought
he was really up to, I was happy to
see him. Fradjikan had seemed deadly
enough in our earlier meetings that
he might actually be able to take Isk-
endarian on -
Except if he triumphed over Isk-
endarian, where would that leave me?
This was all rather confusing. The
only clear part was that Iskendarian
had to be stopped, and stopped fast.
Iskendarian levered his arm again,
shook it, then looked at it with an
expression of puzzlement I could feel.
“Drained already?” he muttered.
He
was tired, I could feel that too, but
surely he wasn’t down to his last

dregs.
I threw myself against him
again, straining as hard as I could to
make him realize he was more than
tired, he was exhausted, he needed to
take a nap, anything to distract him
from -
Another shockwave hit us from be-
hind.
Iskendarian glanced over his
shoulder and reﬂexively spat a word-
string. The ethereal containment balls
swayed and leaned away as though
struck by a sudden high wind, tables
covered with beakers and trays blew
over and slid toward the wall, and
then the wall itself and the whole cor-
ner of the building leaned away too,
the vertical wood planks rippling and
snapping, and both corner walls and
their structural posts pulled away from
the building and fell over.
I didn’t know if I was having as
much of an impact as a gnat, but I was

still shouting at him and pummeling
- or thinking hard about pummeling,
anyway.
Iskendarian was swinging
back, though, and with him I could
feel something dangerous approaching
rapidly... and there he was, Fradjikan,
coming straight toward us out of a
crouch into a lunge, his sword in his
hand outstretched toward Iskendar-
ian’s chest. Iskendarian started to step
away, started to bring Monoch around,
the papers under his arm going ﬂying,
but Fradjikan was clear on target. He
hit Iskendarian off-center on the left
between two ribs in perfect position to
slice through and into his heart -
- and the impact threw us back as
Iskendarian’s
protection
ﬁeld
went
rigid around the sword.
I felt ribs
crunch up and down his chest as the
force of the blow distributed itself,
but the triangular point had not gone

through, and now the end of the sword
was glowing red and drooping and
even the hilt was melting around Frad-
jikan’s hand. The sword dropped to the
ﬂoor and Fradi sunk to his knees after
it, clutching his hand to his chest.
Another explosion blasted behind
us.
Iskendarian ignored it.
He lev-
ered himself off his back, gritting his
teeth, and climbed to his feet. Then he
picked Monoch up off the ﬂoor, raised
him over Fradjikan’s neck, and spoke
the phrase to activate his shift from
stick to blade.
Someone was yelling, “Tildy! Tildy!”
and crashing around in the ﬂames. Be-
ing hit from behind and crushed into
the ﬂoor might well have saved her
life, but the experience had left her so
dazed she could barely move. Still, she
managed to get one arm into the air
and wave it around. An apparition like

an ambulatory creature of mud loomed
over her and seized it. Even through
the smell of the smoke and the dust
and the ﬂaming wood, whoever-it-was
stank. Reeked!
But it-or-he was trying to drag her,
then lift her. “Come on, Tildy,” he was
saying, “you’ve got to get out of -”
“Jurtan? Where did you come from?”
“Right where we’re going back to,
through the wall.” He shifted his grip
to grab her under the arms and stag-
gered toward a splintered shaft of day-
light.
Jardin slipped the ring onto his ﬁn-
ger. Shaa noted that his brother had
taken a step back away from Jardin; he
also appeared to be holding his breath.
“So, you have not betrayed me after
all,” Jardin commented to the Scapula.
“Perhaps you are as wise as you would

have me think. Now -”
Which was when Jardin stiffened
and fell to the ﬂoor with the heavy
clunk of a sudden stone statue.
“Good old Max,” said Arznaak. “Al-
ways so predictable.
But a nice job.
Simple, direct, to the point. Ah, yes -
here comes the other part.”
Indeed,
the ring was starting to
glow, and the paralyzed form of Jardin
seemed to be withering, his skin wrin-
kling and tightening over shrinking
muscles,
its
color
becoming
ashen,
frigid veins showing prominent blue.
“That fellow in the ring is drinking
well, isn’t he?” Arznaak added. “Surely
Max wasn’t about to leave him a way
out, though.” He glanced over at Shaa.
“Enjoying the spectacle, dear brother?”
“You obviously have that side of af-
fairs well covered by yourself,” Shaa
told him.

Arznaak put on a pout. “Oh, but of
course, you’re not in any mood for en-
tertainment. Been feeling rather direc-
tionless, have you, overwhelmed with
ennui? Life seem not worth the trouble
of living?”
Surely he couldn’t mean ...
but he
obviously did. “I thought the curse re-
stricted who I could fall in love with,”
Shaa said slowly. “I never heard about
any of this other stuff.”
“Well, you know.
Even a god can’t
do everything.
The mysteries of the
human heart...” His brother shrugged
an untroubled shrug. “So sue me.” The
Scapula raised a ﬁnger. “But not right
at the moment, if you don’t mind.”
What was Arznaak doing? He was
rummaging in a service drawer be-
neath his sideboard, and then in a
cabinet underneath the drawer, with-
drawing from the former several silver

instruments and from the latter an ice
chest.
“Hold still,” Arznaak told the
paralyzed Jardin, who clearly could do
nothing else. Arznaak knelt carefully
next to Jardin, gingerly took hold of
the end of the ﬁnger wearing the ring
with an ice tong, avoiding all other con-
tact with his rheumy, aged skin, and
brought up his other hand. Shaa had
barely enough time to appreciate the
honed edge of the knife as Arznaak
positioned it over Jardin’s hand and
brought it forcefully down. The knife
embedded itself in the ﬂoor with an
unambiguous thunk.
“One must avoid crosstalk contami-
nation,” Arznaak commented, bringing
the ice tongs up to eye level so he could
inspect the liberated ﬁnger, still wear-
ing the ring.
“And who knows what
other surprises Max might have had
hidden?” He ﬂipped open the ice chest,

dropped in the ﬁnger, and clicked the
lid shut.
“But there remains one important
step,” said Arznaak. Positioning him-
self out of the way of the pool of blood
spreading across the hardwood ﬂoor
from Jardin’s spurting hand, he felt
inside Jardin’s jacket.
“Ah, here we
are.”
He
transferred
Jardin’s
slate
of reference to his own pocket, then
rested both palms ﬂat on Jardin’s chest.
Jardin shuddered rigidly.
Shaa was unable to tell if Jardin’s
eyes were tracking at all, or whether
his pupils were widening and retreat-
ing.
A guttural moan escaped the
man’s throat, though, his head jerked
back and forth, and his heels drummed
once against the ﬂoor.
“Well,” Arznaak said, climbing to his
feet. “That should do for that. Clive!”
One of the assistants who had brough

Shaa and Leen into the room appeared
in the door. “Sir?”
Arznaak
indicated
the
prostrate
Jardin with a backward wave of his
hand. “Take this out and dump it in an
alley somewhere.”
Clive jumped forward to grab Jardin
under the shoulders.
“No,” Arznaak
said, studying the situation.
“By the
heels, I think.”
“Yes, sir,” said Clive. A moment later
he and the thumping Jardin had van-
ished out into the corridor.
“All quite simple, really,” Arznaak
observed, shaking his head, “especially
since the Administrator of Curses is
not very smart. Or the former Curse
Administrator, I should say, and in the
past tense as well. Nor was he careful
enough with the secrets of his ofﬁce.
But one god’s folly is, shall we say, an-
other god’s opportunity.” He straight-

ened, stretched, cracked his back. “In
fact, I can feel the aura settling into
place quite nicely.”
He crossed the room, stood gazing
down at his brother,
then chucked
Shaa under the chin. “You’ve always
been the perfect pawn, dear brother.
Still, family is family; I could scarcely
celebrate such an exciting occasion
without at least one of you present,
now could I? You’ve been an adequate
audience, I suppose, if scarcely more
than that. But now to business. First
up, I think, is to reinstate your curse,
and this time have it enforced prop-
erly too, don’t you think?
Oh, you
don’t want to give me the pleasure of
a verbal retort? Well, no matter; I can
see the question in your eyes.
I had
wondered if you’d feel anything at all
different, but I expect my little diver-
sions have served their purpose.
Do

you understand what has transpired
here, at last?”
“Max traded the ring to the Curse
Administrator behind my back in ex-
change for his removing the curse on
me,” Shaa said grimly.
“We know
Jardin’s been after the ring anyway,
and whatever got him bashed up like
that drained his energy so much it
made him desperate to get it immedi-
ately; he needed the transfusion of en-
ergy. Except you were guiding things
behind the scenes. You were advising
Jardin, but you never told him that
of course Max would booby-trap the
ring regardless of whatever bargain
he made. So you got Jardin to set off
the trap and get consumed, and now
you’ve taken his place.” He shrugged.
“Perfectly straightforward.”
“Well, close enough,” said Arznaak.
“Now, shall we proceed?”

Monoch ﬂamed on.
I braced my-
self - I didn’t know how much of my
experience Iskendarian had access to,
but I remembered the trouble Monoch
had given me the ﬁrst few times I’d
tried to wield him and ﬁgured there
was a chance Iskendarian would be
thrown
momentarily
off
his
stride.
As Monoch solidiﬁed and started to
arc down at Fradjikan’s bowed neck,
though, it looked as though Iskendar-
ian had matters well in hand.
He
must have thought the same thing,
because I could almost feel him relax
and let Monoch’s weight begin to do
the work.
That was when Monoch
suddenly jerked in the air, jarring Isk-
endarian’s arms in their sockets so
hard his teeth snapped together with
a crunch, and then, having established
some sort of pathway, sent a blast of
lightning through the hilt into Isk-

endarian’s body and up into his brain.
Iskendarian staggered back, hands
trying to loose their grip on Monoch’s
hilt, body jiggering uncontrollably, his
vision going dark.
Monoch hit him
with another electric jolt.
Iskendar-
ian’s head whipped back farther than
should have been possible given that
it was still attached to his neck, his
mouth opening for a shriek, but his
whole body had now locked up, all mus-
cles so rigid he might have been trying
to pull his tendons out at the joints. He
fell over toward the ﬂoor.
I hit squarely on the back of my head.
My throat hurt as much as you’d expect
given that a moment before Iskendar-
ian had been trying to force our lungs
out past our teeth, but I still managed
to croak “Don’t - it’s me!” at Monoch be-
fore he came around and took my head
off with a single chop. Instead, he spun

in the air again and tried to drag me
back to my feet.
It was either go with him or decide
whether to lose my arms at the elbow
or the shoulder. Since my joints were
still locked it worked about the same
as stepping on the business end of a
reclining rake to raise the handle to
the vertical. Where Fradjikan had last
been seen was now another heap of
erupting debris. The entire front of the
building was going up, and as Monoch
jerked me tottering away it was clear
the rear area was totally lost as well. I
could barely even make out the tracery
of defense spells now, but from the way
the ﬂames were shaping themselves
across invisible arcs and roiling within
unsupported balls something had to
still be at work. I might have shut my
eyes then; whatever I was doing obvi-
ously didn’t concern Monoch one way

or the other. I thought he might have
even cut his way through a wall at
some point, and he must have dragged
me straight through some signiﬁcant
amount of ﬂame, but it was just as
well.
I wasn’t too excited about hav-
ing to live with myself right at that
particular moment.
But no one asked me. I ﬁnally real-
ized I was lying on my back; when I re-
luctantly dragged open my eyes I saw
overhead continuing billows of smoke,
and slightly below the smoke on either
side a pair of blank walls, and lower
than that a familiar fellow I was not
at all surprised to ﬁnd there.
It was my old pal Gashanatantra.
He had shifted further away from
his tweedy Jardin disguise, of course,
but I was coming to think I’d recognize
him in any incarnation, even if his
wife and other old friends didn’t.
At

the moment, the air of intrigue and
menace and wheels revolving within
wheels that usually hovered over him
like a habitual warning of dangerous
weather ahead was somewhat frayed
as a result of the fact that he was
covered in soot, his clothes were shred-
ded, and he had apparently been close
enough to a ﬁre himself to leave them
totally singed except for the patches
that had entirely burnt through; he
was holding one hand against a dark-
stained patch on his side, and one
temple was covered with matted blood.
Next to him on the ground, barely as
tall as my chest would have been if I’d
been able to stand up, was a brass ball
studded with gears and linkages and
sighing steam cylinders venting their
tired wisps of lackluster vapor.
Monoch was lying across my chest at
an awkward angle, his point embedded

in the alley muck at my side. Both of
my hands were still locked around his
hilt.
I ignored Monoch and regarded
Gash.
“Should I be thanking you?” I
said to him, ignoring the stabbing pain
from the broken ribs in my chest.
“All things considered,” Gash said
evenly, “I rather think you should.”
“Just so I know,” I added.
But he
wasn’t exactly giving his full attention
to me.
He was now gazing down the alley at
what was clearly the smoldering mess
of the Karlini lab. From the look of him,
too, I had a feeling this wasn’t the only
wreckage he’d been involved in today.
“This is not how events should have
turned out,” Gash was saying to him-
self, “not at all.” Then he turned back
to me, eyeing me with a glance of new
appraisal. “Apparently I was mistaken
about certain things, but -”

“Such as?” I croaked.
“Nothing material, except possibly
on the question of scale.” Now he was
favoring Monoch with a glare.
“You
could have given me a little more
warning. I might have been standing
by closer to hand.” He shook his head.
“Instead things are clearly worse, sig-
niﬁcantly worse, worse even than I had
expected.”
“Great,” I told him. “Now you’re an
optimist.”
