Preface
The recent remarkable development of microsystems dates back to 1983 when
Richard P. Feynman of California University delivered a speech to a large
audience of scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He pre-
sented the concept of sacriﬁced etching to fabricate a silicon micromotor, and
pointed out the need for a friction-less, contact sticking-free structure, due to
the relative increase of the surface eﬀect in such microsystems and devices. A
micromotor fabricated by Fan et al. in 1988 caused a tremendous sensation
and opened the way for Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) technol-
ogy. The diameter of the rotor was 120 µm, its rotational speed was 500 rpm,
and the gap between the rotor and the stator was 2 µm. Today, many success-
ful examples of MEMS products can be found: MEMS such as accelerometers,
pressure sensors, microphones and gyros are used commercially, and various
branches of industry are already including MEMS components in their new
products.
Furthermore, optical MEMS, or micromechanical photonics, are evolv-
ing in interdisciplinary research and engineering ﬁelds to merge indepen-
dently developed technologies based on optics, mechanics, electronics and
physical/chemical sciences. Manufacturing technologies such as semiconductor
lasers, surface-micromachining and bulk-micromachining are promoting this
fusion of technologies. In addition, new devices such as optical MEMS includ-
ing optical sensors, optical switches, optical scanners, optical heads, near-ﬁeld
probes, optical rotors and mixers, actuators, and microsystems for diagno-
sis and treatments, and new conceptual frameworks such as micromechanical
photonics including an optical encoder, a tunable laser diode with a micro-
cantilever and Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (NEMS) are appearing.
Rapidly emerging interdisciplinary science and technology are expected
to provide new capabilities in sensing, actuation, and control. Advances such
as MEMS, optical MEMS, micromechanical photonics and microﬂuidics have
led not only to a reduction in size but also be the merging of computation,
communication and power with sensing, actuation and control to provide new
functions. By integrating smart optoelectronics and antennas for remote con-
trol with a microstructure, the ability of microsystems to interpret and control

its environment will be drastically improved. Much further work, however, is
required to develop this new ﬁeld to the stage of commercial production.
The purpose of this book is to give the engineering student and the practi-
cal engineer a systematic introduction to optical MEMS and micromechanical
photonics not only through theoretical and experimental results, but also by
describing various products and their ﬁelds of application. Chapter 1 begins
with an overview spanning topics from optical MEMS to micromechanical
photonics and the diversity of products using them at present and in the near
future. Chapter 2 demonstrates extremely short-external-cavity laser diodes,
tunable laser diodes, a resonant sensor and an integrated optical head. The
chapter deals with laser diodes closely aligned with a microstructure includ-
ing a diaphragm, a microcantilever and a slider. Chapter 3 addresses optical
tweezers. This new technology is employed to manipulate various types of ob-
jects in a variety of research and industrial ﬁelds. The section ﬁrst analyzes
the trapping eﬃciency by geometrical optics and then compares the theory
with the results obtained experimentally, ﬁnally presenting a variety of appli-
cations. Chapter 4 deals with the design and fabrication of an optical rotor and
evaluates its improved mixing of micro-liquids for future ﬂuidic applications
such as micrototal analysis systems (µ-TAS). In Chap. 5, the fundamentals
and applications of the near ﬁeld are described for the future development of
micromechanical photonics. This technology enables us to observe, read/write
and fabricate beyond the wavelength resolution by accessing and controlling
the near ﬁeld. The chapter deals with near-ﬁeld features, theoretical analyses,
experimental analyses and applications mainly related to optical recording.

From Optical MEMS to Micromechanical
Photonics
Micromechanical photonics is evolving in interdisciplinary research and en-
gineering ﬁelds and merging independently developed technologies based on
optics, mechanics, electronics, and physical/chemical sciences. Manufacturing
technologies such as those of semiconductor lasers, surface micromachining
and bulk micromachining are promoting technology fusion.
This chapter presents an overview of the emerging technologies that fea-
ture new conceptual frameworks such as optical microelectromechanical sys-
tems (optical MEMS) including an integrated optical sensor, an integrated
optical switch, an integrated optical head, an optical rotor, and a microto-
tal analysis system (µ-TAS); micromechanical photonics devices including an
extremely short-external-cavity tunable laser diode (LD) with a microcan-
tilever, a resonant sensor, an optical encoder and a blood ﬂow sensor; nano-
electromechanical systems (NEMS) and system networks.
1.1 Micromechanical Photonics – An Emerging
Technology
We have made substantial progress in individual areas of optics, mechan-
ics, electronics and physical/chemical sciences, but it is insuﬃcient to apply
individual technologies and sciences to solve today’s complicated technical
problems. The start of semiconductor LD room temperature continuous oscil-
lation in 1970 and micromachining technology [1.1,1.2] based on photolitho-
graphy and selective etching in the late 1980s resulted in the birth of optical
MEMS [1.3]/micromechanical photonics [1.4] that combines/integrates electri-
cal, mechanical, thermal, and sometimes chemical components through optics
in the early 1990s.
Various kinds of optical MEMS have been developed for the ﬁelds of in-
formation, communication, and medical treatment. They include a digital
micromirror device (DMD) [1.5] for both large projection display and color
printing, optical switches [1.6,1.7] for communication, microservo mechanisms

1 From Optical MEMS to Micromechanical Photonics
[1.8, 1.9] for optical and magnetic recording, and µ-TAS [1.10] for medical
treatment.
Advanced lithography has been applied not only to silicon (Si) but also
to thin ﬁlm materials, including dielectric [1.11], polyimide [1.12], and metal
[1.13] to oﬀer unprecedented capabilities in extending the functionality and
miniaturization of electro-optical devices and systems. Group III–V com-
pounds, which include gallium arsenide (GaAs) [1.14] and indium phosphide
(InP) [1.15], are attractive for integrating optical and mechanical structures to
eliminate the need for optical alignment. In a tunable LD, the moving external
cavity mirror has been integrated with a surface-emitting LD [1.16]. A moving
cantilever has been integrated with edge-emitting LDs and a photodiode in a
resonant sensor [1.17]. Monolithic integration technologies are expanding the
ﬁeld of micromechanical photonics.
Novel probing technologies such as the scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) and optical tweezers have advanced our knowledge of surface sci-
ence [1.18, 1.19] and technology, which are important in microscale and
nanoscale mechanisms. Today’s science and technology requires the focus-
ing of multidisciplinary teams from engineering, physics, chemistry, and life
sciences in both universities and industry. In this chapter, I ﬁrst review
fabrication methods of microstructures, then summarize some of the high-
lights in these attractive research ﬁelds, and then discuss the outlook for the
future.
1.2 Fabrication Methods
There are common steps in fabricating optical MEMS/micromechanical
devices: deposition, sputtering and etching, bulk micromachining including
anisotropic etching and etch stop, and surface micromachining characterized
by sacriﬁced layers that are etched away to leave etch-resistant layers. The
fabrication methods of microstructures with optical elements are reviewed
in [1.1,1.2]. Miniaturization requires high aspect ratios and new materials. Re-
active ion beam etching (RIBE) precisely deﬁnes the features and the spacing
in deposited thin ﬁlm and is of great importance in making high-aspect-ratio
microstructures.
Si has been the most commonly used in micromachining, and its good elec-
trical and mechanical properties have resulted in many commercially available
sensors and actuators. A diaphragm is fabricated by bulk micromachining
such as selective wet etching. Free-space micro-optical systems can be fabri-
cated by surface micromachining; this is very promising and will greatly enrich
the variety of integrated optical devices [1.20]. One choice is the silicon-on-
insulator (SOI) technology [1.21]. Advantages of the SOI technology are its
simplicity and small number of process steps.
Group III–V compounds, such as GaAs and InP, are attractive candidates
for monolithic integration of optical and mechanical structures [1.14, 1.15].
Concrete examples are given later.

1.2.1 Bulk and Surface Micromachining
To fabricate structures by bulk micromachining, two etching methods can be
used, isotropic and anisotropic etchings. In isotropic etching, etching proceeds
at the same rate in all directions, which leads to the isotropic undercut shown
in Fig. 1.1a. On the other hand, in anisotropic etching, etching proceeds at
diﬀerent rates depending on the crystal orientation, which leads to precise
features, shown in Fig. 1.1b. Silicon V-grooves are fabricated by anisotropic
etching of a (100) silicon substrate and are widely used in optical MEMS. The
V-grooves are also used in packing of ﬁber and optoelectronic components.
To fabricate structures by surface micromachining, a sacriﬁced ﬁlm is ﬁrst
deposited and patterned on the wafer. The ﬁlm to be formed into the desired
microstructure is next deposited and patterned, and the sacriﬁced layer is then
etched away, undercutting the microstructure and leaving it freely suspended.
There are two kinds of surface micromachining: photolithography for a thick-
ness less than several 10 µm, and electron beam lithography for a thickness of
less than 1 µm.
Photolithography
Photolithography is most widely used for the fabrication of a microstructure.
The process steps shown in Fig. 1.2 include ultraviolet (UV) light exposure,
development, etching, and resist stripping. This essentially 2-D process has
the following characteristics:
1. diﬃculty in fabricating features smaller than the exposure light wave-
length
2. high throughput by a mask process
3. relatively high aspect ratio.
The electrostatic micromotor [1.2] shown in Fig. 1.3, fabricated by Fan
et al. of California University in 1988, caused a tremendous sensation and
paved the way for the development of MEMS technology. The diameter of the
microrotor was 120 µm and the gap between the rotor and the stator was 2 µm.
Both were made of polysilicon thin ﬁlms. When pulse voltages are applied to
stator poles with diﬀerent phases, an electrostatic torque arises between the
rotor and the stator, which leads to the rotation rate of 500 rpm. Two years
later, Mehregany et al. [1.22] of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
fabricated a micromotor with a higher speed of 15000 rpm. Recently, com-
mercially used MEMS such as pressure sensors, accelerometers, and gyros are
fabricated by the successive photolithography.

In the case of thick microstructures, SU-8 resists are widely used [1.23].
Physical properties of SU-8 can be found at http://aveclafaux.freeservers.com/
SU-8.html. To view typical SU-8 applications, visit http://www.mimotec.ch/.
As an example of optical MEMS, the process for fabricating optical pres-
sure rotors having anisotropic geometry on the side is shown in Fig. 1.4. First,
the SiO2 layer is deposited on a GaAs substrate, and then the SiO2 is etched
down to the GaAs substrate by reactive ion beam etching (not by UV light).
The substrate is then immersed in a wet-etching solution to dissolve the GaAs

optical rotors are 20 µm in diameter and 10 µm thick, and are made of SiO2 or
polyimide or SU-8, which are transparent at the laser wavelength of 1.06 µm.
Electron Beam Lithography
In electron beam lithography (EBL), focused high-energy electrons with wave-
lengths less than that of UV light are irradiated onto electron-sensitive resist,
as shown in Fig. 1.5. High-resolution patterning can be accomplished by scan-
ning the e-beam two-dimensionally on the resist. Numerous commercial resists
have been produced. EBL exhibits the following characteristics:
1. high-resolution patterning (less than 0.1 µm)
2. Easy and precise deﬂection by electrostatic or magnetic ﬁeld
3. No need for mask process
4. Low throughput due to direct e-beam writing
5. Low aspect ratio (less than 1 µm thick).
1.2.2 Three-Dimensional Micromachining
LIGA
A surface-micromachined device has a thickness less than 100 µm. However,
many micromechanical devices, particularly microactuators, require a thick-
ness of few hundreds micrometers. Microstructures with a very large aspect

be achieved using LIGA exceeds 300. LIGA exhibits the following character-
istics:
1. high resolution
2. high aspect ratio
3. high throughput by mask and molding process
4. complicated mask production process.

Figure 1.7 shows an LIGA-based tunable infrared (IR) ﬁlter [1.25]. Grat-
ings with free-standing nickel walls as high as 50 µm with periods on the order
of 10 µm were fabricated by LIGA. The linear actuator utilizes a permalloy
electromagnet with an air gap because of the large power (0.1 mN) necessary
to adjust the spacing of the grating. Furthermore, simple 3-D microstructures
will be fabricated by the LIGA process [1.26].
Photoforming
Complicated 3-D microstructures have been fabricated by stacking preshaped
layers made by solidifying a thin resin layer with UV light [1.27,1.28]. There
are two solidiﬁcation methods: a free surface and a ﬁxed surface solidiﬁcation.
In the case of the free surface, solidiﬁcation occurs at the resin/air interface,
leading to perturbation on the surface. On the other hand, in the case of the
ﬁxed surface, solidiﬁcation occurs at the stable window/resin interface, leading
to smoother structures. Photoforming exhibits the following characteristics:
1. complicated microstructures can be fabricated
2. laser beam can be deﬂected easily by scanning mirrors
3. no need for mask process
4. low throughput due to direct laser beam writing.

Fig. 1.9. 3-D microfabrication with photopolymerization using scanning focused
laser beam
We also can directly fabricate a microstructure by scanning the laser beam
in the resin. Figure 1.8 shows the mechanism of photopolymerization using a
focused laser beam. Figure 1.9 shows the block diagram of such a point-by-
point photoforming method. A focused blue laser beam (wavelength of 473 nm,
output power of 10 mW) is used to solidify the resin. The scanning of the blue
laser beam is controlled by adjusting mirrors according to the slice data of
the microstructure. In this case, a 3-D structure is fabricated by scanning
the focused spot in three dimensions inside the resin, rather than by using a
layer-by-layer process. Although the spot diameter is small at the focal plane,
the depth of focus is large, which leads to inferior resolution at depth.
In order to improve 3-D resolution, several photoforming methods have
been proposed, as listed in Table 1.1. Photopolymerization stimulated by two-
photon absorption was demonstrated using a Ti:sapphire laser and urethane-
based resin (SCR-500), as shown in Fig. 1.10 [1.29]. Since the two-photon

absorption rate is proportional to the square of the incident light intensity, a
3-D structure is fabricated by scanning the focused spot of a near-infrared-
wavelength beam in three dimensions inside the resin. The lateral and depth
resolutions are said to 0.62 and 2.2 µm, respectively. After that, they also
succeeded in fabricating a micrometer sized cow with a resolution of 140 nm
[1.30].
Replication
Replication from a mold is important technology for realizing lower cost and
mass production. For optical MEMS applications, the use of sol–gels which
become glass-like material upon curing is foreseen. ORMOCER US-S4 is such
a material. It is optically transparent over the wavelength from 400 to 1600 nm
and has a refractive index of 1.52 at 588 nm. Obi et al. replicated many sol–gel
micro-optical devices and optical MEMS including a sol–gel cantilever with a
microlens on the top [1.31].
1.2.3 Monolithic Integration – Micromachining for an LD
Monolithic integration of micromechanics is possible not only on a Si sub-
strate but also on a semiconductor LD substrate of GaAs [1.14] or InP [1.15].
A smooth etched surface and a deep vertical sidewall are necessary for good
lasing characteristics of LDs.
For fabricating a resonant microcantilever (MC), for example, there are
three micromachining steps (Fig. 1.11). (a) An etch-stop layer of AlGaAs
is formed in an LD structure prepared by metalorganic vapor phase epi-
taxy (MOVPE). (b) The microstructure shape is precisely deﬁned by a re-
active dry-etching technique, which simultaneously forms the vertical etched

mirror facets for LDs. (c) A wet-etching window is made with a resist,
and the microcantilever is undercut by selective etching to leave it freely
suspended.
These processes are compatible with laser fabrication, so an MC structure
can be fabricated at the same time as an LD structure. Furthermore, because
a single-crystal epitaxial layer has little residual stress, precise microstructures
can be obtained without signiﬁcant deformation.
Combined use of the above micromachining processes will be useful in the
future. However, processing of electronics and MEMS must be compatible and
should be held down to low costs. In many actual microsystems, microassem-
bly, bonding, and packing techniques will also play important roles. Moreover,
to apply the merit of the mask process to the MEMS with an arrayed struc-
ture, it is imperative to increase the yield rate.
1.3 Miniaturized Systems with Microoptics
and Micromechanics
1.3.1 Important Aspects for Miniaturization
We see that the miniaturization techniques described earlier will provide many
new optical MEMS that will environmentally friendly due to their smallness,
reliable due to the integration process, and low in cost owing to mass pro-
duction. However, new problems arise as a result of the miniaturization. Un-
derstanding the scaling laws and the important aspects of miniaturization
will help readers in choosing the appropriate actuator mechanism and power
source.
Feynman presented the concept of sacriﬁced etching to fabricate a silicon
micromotor 20 years ago [1.32]. At the same time, he pointed out the necessity
of friction-less and contact sticking-free structure for the MEMS because of
the relative increase of the surface eﬀect in such microdevices.
Figure 1.12 shows the general characteristics of scaling laws. As the object
size [L] decreases, the ratio of surface area [L2] to volume [L3] increases.
Weight depends on volume, while drag force depends on surface area, which
renders surface forces highly important in microstructures. Faster evaporation
associated with larger surface-to-volume ratios has important consequences in
analytical equipment such as µ-TAS.
Response time is proportional to [mass/frictional force], i.e., [L3/L2] = [L],
which leads to fast response. The Reynolds number is proportional to [inertia
force/viscous drag force], i.e., [L4/L2] = [L2], which leads to laminar ﬂow.
Moving energy is proportional to [mass × velocity2], i.e., [L3 × L2] = [L5],
which leads to low energy consumption.
Almost all micromotors and microactuators have been built based on elec-
trostatic actuation, nevertheless, electrostatic force is proportional to [L2],
but electromagnetic force is proportional to [L4]. This is because the plate for

generating electrostatic force is easier to fabricate in a limited space than the
inductance coil that generates the magnetic ﬁeld for actuation. Actually, to
drive thick and heavy MEMS [1.25], electromagnetic force is used because the
electrostatic driving force is too weak.
We deal mostly with micrometer-sized devices. In the micrometer regime,
conventional macrotheories concerning electrical, mechanical, ﬂuidic, optical,
and thermal devices require corrections. Speciﬁc properties of the thin ﬁlm
material diﬀer from those of bulk. Shape change due to thermal stress or fast
movement occurs in the micromirror fabricated by surface micromachining,
which degrades the optical quality of the laser beam.
1.3.2 Light Processing by Micromechanics
Since light can be controlled by applying relatively low energy, the electro-
static microstructures such as moving mirrors or moving gratings have been
fabricated on the same wafer. Applications of moving mirrors in micro posi-
tioning have begun to appear recently, and many kinds of digital light switches
have been demonstrated. These include a DMD [1.5], an optical scanner [1.33],
a tunable IR ﬁlter [1.25], and a comb-drive nickel micromirror [1.34]. A nickel
micromirror driven by a comb-drive actuator was fabricated by nickel surface
micromachining. The micromirror was 19 µm high and 50 µm wide and the
facet reﬂectivity was estimated to be 63%. A microstrip antenna was fab-
ricated on a fused quartz structure that could be rotated to adjust spatial
scanning of the emitted microwave beam [1.35].

1.3 Miniaturized Systems with Microoptics and Micromechanics

Free-space Micro-optical Bench and Sensors
Vertical micromirrors can be fabricated by anisotropic etching on (100) silicon
just like the V-groove described in Sect. 1.2.1. The (111) planes are perpen-
dicular to the Si surface and atomically smooth. Therefore, high-aspect-ratio
mirrors can be formed. Figure 1.13 shows an on-chip Mach-Zehnder interfer-
ometer produced by Uenishi [1.36]. Micromirrors are reported several µms
thick and 200 µm high.
Free-space micro-optical elements held by 3-D alignment structures on
a silicon substrate have been demonstrated using a surface-micromachining
technique in which the optical elements are ﬁrst fabricated by a planar process
and then the optical elements are folded, into 3-D structures, as shown in
Fig. 1.14 [1.37]. Figure 1.15 shows the schematic of the out-of-plane micro-
Fresnel lens fabricated on a hinged polysilicon plate (a), and the assembly
process for the 3-D micro-Fresnel lens (b) [1.38]. A Fresnel lens stands in
front of an edge-emitting LD to collimate its light beam.

LD and a micro-optical element, a micro-XYZ stage consisting of a pair of

parallel 45◦mirrors has been demonstrated to match the optical axis of the
LD with that of the micro-optical element [1.38]. Both the micro-XYZ stage
and the free-space micro-optical elements are fabricated by the microhinge
technique to achieve high-performance single-chip micro-optical systems.
Digital Micromirror Device (DMD)
A digital micromirror device (DMD) was developed by Texas Instruments in
1987. A standard DMD microchip has a 2-D array of 0.4 × 106 switching
micromirrors. Figure 1.16 shows a DMD structure consisting of a mirror that
is connected to a yoke through two torsion hinges fabricated by a CMOS-like
process. Each light switch has an aluminum mirror that can be rotated ±10
degrees by electrostatic force depending on the state of the underlying CMOS
circuit [1.5].
The surface micromachining process to fabricate DMD is shown in
Fig. 1.17. The illustrations are after sacriﬁcial layer patterning (a), after oxide
hinge mask pattering (b), after yoke oxide patterning (c), after yoke/hinge
etching and oxide stripping (d), after mirror oxide patterning (e), and the
completed device (f). “CMP” in (a) means “chemomechanically polished” to
provide a ﬂat surface.
Figure 1.18 shows the optical layout of a large-screen projection display
using a DMD. The DMD is a micromechanical reﬂective spatial light mod-
ulator consisting of an array of aluminum micromirrors. A color ﬁlter wheel
divided into three colors; red, blue, and green, is used for color presentation.
A 768 × 576 pixel DMD was tested and a contrast ratio of 100 was reported.

trollers, and modulators are some of the devices required in optical

communication. Optical MEMS has become a household word thanks to
the enormous interest in ﬁber-optic switching technology. Micromirror-based
all-optical switches are thought to be the only actual solution to wavelength
division multiplexing (WDM) because they are independent of wavelength.
Miniaturized optical switches can be changed to select diﬀerent optical paths
by adjusting the mirror tilt (without optic to electric transformation).
The micromirrors were fabricated based on the surface micromachining of
polysilicon thin ﬁlms (Fig. 1.19) in the ﬁrst stage [1.6, 1.7]. Miniaturization
methods enable the creation of arrays of tiny, high-capacity optical switches,
such as those for switching 256 input light beams to 256 output ﬁbers devel-
oped at Lucent Technologies [1.7]. An optical switch of 1152 × 1152 optical
cross-connects was fabricated by Nortel. Free-space switching with a MEMS
micromirror array between two stacked planar lightwave circuits (PLCs) is
used to construct a wavelength-selective switch [1.39].
Recently, bulk micromachining of crystalline silicon has been revived
(Fig. 1.20) [1.40, 1.41] because the conventional mirror surface (polysilicon)
fabricated by surface micromachining is thin (1 µm) and deformable due to
the presence of both residual stress and a metal ﬁlm coating [1.42]. The use of

silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates together with deep reactive ion etching
(DRIE) is now an established technology for fabricating high-performance
optical switches because of the ﬂatness of the mirror [1.43].
Optical Heads
Various optical disk systems with a Blue ray/digital versatile disk (DVD)/
compact disc (CD) compatible optical head, a free-space integrated optical
head, and an electrostatic torsion mirror for tracking have been investigated
for the advanced DVD [1.44]. Flying optical heads with various small-aperture
probes are proposed for next-generation near-ﬁeld recording.
Three kinds of light wavelength λ and objective lens NA are used
for the optical heads of a Blue ray, a DVD and a CD: (λ, NA)
=
(405 nm, 0.8), (650 nm, 0.6), and (785 nm, 0.5), respectively. Compatibility of
heads with diﬀerent wavelengths and diﬀerent NAs, is needed (Fig. 1.21) [1.45].

The compatibility principle is based on spherical aberration correction and
objective NA control for each disk. Optical MEMS technologies are applied
to control NA (aperture) depending on the wavelength [1.45], to integrate op-
tical components (Fig. 1.22) [1.20], and to track the optical disk groove [1.9].
Rotable microstages are implemented by a suspended polysilicon plate fabri-
cated by micromachining.
In order to realize an ultrahigh-density optical disk, a tiny-aperture
probe is needed. However, the optical transmittance decreases rapidly as the
aperture diameter decreases below 100 nm. To increase the transmittance, a
bow–tie probe with an actuator driven by electrostatic force was successfully
fabricated (Fig. 1.23) [1.46]. The on-chip actuator provides not only a narrow
gap to enhance the intensity of the near ﬁeld but also precision alignment of
the optical components.
µ-TAS/bio MEMS
Chip-scale technologies are diversifying into the ﬁeld of microﬂuidics, such
as a sample analysis system for physiological monitoring, sample preparation
and screening, and a biomedical treatment application for a new surgical tool
and drug delivery [1.47].
A micrototal analysis system (µ-TAS) [1.48] is expected to reduce inspec-
tion time or the amount of reagent needed. The system shown in Fig. 1.24
comprises inlets for the sample and reagent loading, microchannels with a
mixing chamber and an analysis chamber, and outlets for sample wastes.
In a microchannel, mixing is performed mainly by diﬀusion owing to the
small Reynolds number. To promote a diﬀusion eﬀect by interweaving two
ﬂuids, mixing devices such as micronozzle arrays to increase the contact area,

important because of the reaction between small liquids, as well as to drive
liquids in microchannels.
Optical inspection of a human body is also a useful method for minimally
invasive diagnosis and treatment. Figure 1.25 shows the microconfocal opti-
cal scanning microscope (m-COSM) [1.53]. The probe, 2.4 mm in diameter,
consists of a 2-D electrostatic scanner which is placed in front of the end of
the optical ﬁber. Light reﬂected by the tissue is collected by the same objec-
tive lens and reﬂected back into the same optical ﬁber. The ﬁeld of view is
100 µm × 100 µm and the resolution is 1 µm with an image feed speed of 4
frames s−1.

1.3.3 Kinetic Energy of Light
Light is conventionally applied in optical data storage such as CDs and DVDs,
in an optoelectronic information apparatus such as displays and printers, in
optical communication devices such as optical ﬁbers and LDs, and in optical
measurements using various kinds of sensors. In these applications, we have
utilized the electromagnetic aspect of light. On the other hand, in optical
MEMS and in micromechanical photonics applications, the kinetic energy
aspect of light becomes important.
Powering of miniaturized equipments or systems by a light beam has re-
cently been rediscovered, and many kinds of transduction from light energy to
kinetic energy have been developed. The photoelectric eﬀect was used to make
a photostrictional actuator driven by light-induced conformational change of a
polymer, semiconductor or ceramic. The photothermal eﬀect was used to make
a tiny resonator [1.14], a micropump, a microgripper [1.54] and a waveguide
switch [1.55]. A photoformed gripper, designed for handling micro-objects in
a narrow space, is actuated by the volume change of ﬂuid upon applying laser
power. This photothermal energy will be useful as a driving force of minia-
turized systems because of its high power density and good energy transfer
eﬃciency. A photoelectrochemical eﬀect was studied for the development of a
storage battery [1.56].
A photovoltaic microdevice to cover the surface of a miniaturized sys-
tem was developed for amorphous silicon thin ﬁlms triple-stacked and series-
connected to obtain a high voltage of 200 V [1.57]. A microdevice to transfer
energy via light to a microwave by combining piezoelectric force and an an-
tenna has been reported [1.58].
1.3.4 Micromechanical Control by Optical Pressure

oretical and experimental knowledge and technology in this ﬁeld has been

rotor which uses optical torque exerted on its side surfaces (a), and a cylindrical
optical rotor which has slopes for rotation on its upper surfaces (b)
accumulated. Today, such technology is used in various scientiﬁc and engi-
neering ﬁelds to manipulate [1.59], align [1.60], and switch [1.61] many kinds
of micro-objects. Optical tweezers is described in detail in Chap. 3.
Using a laser beam the rotation of artiﬁcial micro-objects fabricated by
micromachining was demonstrated. Figure 1.26 shows two kinds of optical
rotors: a rotationally but not bilaterally symmetric structured rotor to which
optical torque is exerted on its side surfaces (a) [1.62], and a cylindrical op-
tical rotor which has slopes for trapping and rotating on its upper surfaces
(b) [1.63]. The rotation mechanism has been shown both experimentally and
theoretically.
The use of optical rotors is expected to solve the problems of an MEMS
motor, i.e., short lifetime due to friction and the requirement of electrical wires
for the power supply. Applications of directional high-speed optical rotation
may include an optical motor and a microgear for micromachines [1.64,1.65]
and a micromixer [1.66] for µ-TAS. These optical-rotor-related technolo-
gies could have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on developments in optical MEMS and
micromechanical photonic systems. Optical rotation is described in detail in
Chap. 4.
1.4 Integrated Systems with LDs and Micromechanics
In micromechanical photonics applications using LDs of group III–V com-
pounds are predominant for monolithic integration of microstructures. They
include a GaAs-based integrated tunable laser [1.16, 1.67], a resonant sen-
sor [1.17], an optical encoder [1.68], an optical head [1.69], and an InP-based
free-standing microstructure [1.15], and a portable blood ﬂow sensor [1.70],
which can be used to provide supersmall, cost-eﬀective microdevices.
1.4.1 Tunable LD
Tunable LDs are desirable for use in WDM communications, multi-
wavelength optical data storage, sensing systems, and a variety of scientiﬁc

output wavelength from the other laser diode (LD1)
instrumentations. A surface-emitting LD or an LED with microstructure, as
shown in Fig. 1.27, can be used for micromechanically tuned devices [1.16].
By varying the external cavity length, the laser wavelength can be easily
changed.
Edge-emitting LDs that have an extremely short-external-cavity length are
also applicable as tunable LDs [1.67], as shown in Fig. 1.28. The wavelength
shift varies every λ/2. The tuning span was 30 nm around 1,300 nm, which
was measured using an LD on a slider with an antireﬂection coating [1.71] on
the LD facet facing the external mirror. To increase the monolithically inte-
grated cantilever displacement driven by the temperature rise induced upon
applying the LD, an antireﬂection-coated metal-dielectric bimorph structure
was designed [1.72].
1.4.2 Resonant Sensor
A resonant sensor is a device that changes its mechanical resonant frequency
as a function of a physical or chemical parameter such as stress or massloading.

A microcantilever (MC), LD, and a photodiode (PD) have been fabricated on
the surface of a GaAs substrate, as shown in Fig. 1.29. Possible applications are
resonant frequency detection sensors such as accelerometers, and mechanical
ﬁlters such as those for synchronizing signal detection, which are described in
Sect. 2.4.2 [1.17].
1.4.3 Optical Encoder
Elimination of bulky optical components, including a beamsplitter, a reﬂection
mirror, a photodiode, and a collimating lens, will lead to adjustment-free,
cost-eﬀective small optical devices. An optical encoder consisting of a PD, a
U-shaped LD, and microlenses, as shown in Figs. 1.30 and 1.31, was proposed.
It has been evaluated to measure the relative displacement between a scale
grating and the encoder itself with a resolution of 0.01 µm [1.68].
When the encoder moves a distance x relative to the grating, the phase
shift of the light refracted at the grating of pitch Λ is + 2πx/Λ for one etched

caused by the refracted lights is expressed as a function of period 4πx/Λ.
1.4.4 Integrated Flying Optical Head
Figure 1.32 shows a ﬂying optical head with an integrated LD [1.69]. The ﬂying
optical head consists of a monolithically integrated LD and a PD attached to
the slider. Autofocusing is accomplished by means of an air bearing, which
maintains a spacing of 2 µm and eliminates the need for a focusing servo
system.
The sensing part of the head is an LD integrated with a PD, as shown
in Fig. 1.33. To reduce the light beam width parallel to the junction plane,
a taper-ridged waveguide was fabricated on the edge of the diode cavity by
reactive ion beam etching (RIBE). The ridged waveguide is 1.3 µm wide and
the groove is 3 µm deep, which is deeper than the active layer. The full widths
half-maximum (FWHM) of the near-ﬁeld pattern perpendicular and parallel
to the junction plane are 0.65 and 0.85 µm, respectively, at the facet.

An LD used in an optical head forms a composite cavity with a recording
medium. Light output of the LD is either a strong stimulated emission corre-
sponding to the high-reﬂectivity part of the nonmark or a weak spontaneous
emission corresponding to the low-reﬂectivity part of the mark. That is, the
laser is switched according to the light fed back from the recording medium.
1.4.5 Blood Flow Sensor
A very small and lightweight blood ﬂow sensor was constructed using sur-
face mounting techniques, as shown in Fig. 1.34 [1.70]. The hybrid integrated
structure of the optical system incorporates an edge-emitting InGaAsP-InP

photodiode (PD) and a polyimide waveguide on a silicon substrate.
Figure 1.34a shows the velocity measurement principle. The DFB LD in
Fig. 1.34b illuminates the human skin and the lights scattered by the ﬂowing
blood and by the stationary tissue interfere on the PD. The beat frequency
between the two depends on the average velocity of the blood ﬂow. This
integrated ﬂow sensor can be positioned directly on a ﬁnger and permits real-
time monitoring of the blood ﬂow.
1.5 Future Outlook of Optical MEMS
and Micromechanical Photonics
One advantage of the optical method in microdevices is that it is not af-
fected by electromagnetic interference. This is particularly critical for highly
integrated devices. Other advantages are its remote control and friction-free
characteristics, which are of great value in optical tweezers and optical rotors.
An earlier disadvantage was that the optical technique required lenses and
ﬁber systems to guide the light to a PD or a moving mechanism, but recent
micromachining technology has made it easy to eliminate these lenses and
ﬁber systems, leading to the easy integration of optics, mechanics and elec-
tronics. In this section we present current and potential applications of the
optical MEMS and micromechanical photonics.
Various kinds of optical MEMS/micromechanical photonics devices have
been fabricated on Si substrates, polymers, and III–V compounds. They in-
clude a micrograting/micromirror with a rotating stage for optical inter-
connects, a micromirror scanner for displays and printers, a micromirror
switch/tunable LD for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems, in-
formation and communication apparatus, and sophisticated positioning sys-
tems at submicrometer and nanometer levels. Other applications may be in
medical instruments such as micropumps for disposable drug delivery sys-
tems [1.52], medical microsystems for minimally invasive diagnosis and treat-
ment [1.53] and µ-TAS [1.48].
Researchers have been using various types of controlling/driving methods:
for example, optical, electrostatic, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric methods,
as shown in Table 1.2. Optical force is classiﬁed into optical pressure, photo-
electric, photothermal, and photo-electrochemical eﬀects. Table 1.2 shows al-
ready proposed or commercialized optical MEMS/micromechanical photonics
devices and systems classiﬁed according to the driving method and materials
used. Refer to the fabrication method and reference number given after each
device/system. In the table, we can see not only conventional sensors and
actuators but also the recently developed tunable LDs, optical switches, scan-
ners, mirrors, optical heads, near-ﬁeld probes, control devices with nanometer
precision, and medical microsystems [1.73] for diagnosis and treatment.

1.5 Future Outlook of Optical MEMS and Micromechanical Photonics
29
The reduction of friction force and the adoption of contact sticking-free
mechanisms are important in microscale operation. Therefore, microstructures
without contact, for example, a micromirror suspended by two torsion hinges
[1.5], a cantilever [1.17], a deformable membrane [1.16], and a ﬂying slider
[1.69] are preferably used to prevent friction and sticking.
Figure 1.35 shows the direction of development in these technical ﬁelds.
The horizontal axis shows miniaturization (size) and the vertical axis shows
the number of functions that characterize the optical MEMS/micromechanical
photonics devices. To evaluate the number of functions, we ﬁrst considered
how optics, mechanics, and electronics are combined (1) simple assembly,
(2) hybrid, and (3) monolithic. Second, in how many directions can the de-
vice/system move (1) 1D, (2) 2D, and (3) 3D. Finally, what kind of functions
does the device/system have: measurement, feedback control, recognition, and
remote power supply. We gave a point for each function. The maximum num-
ber of points becomes 3 + 3 + 5 = 11. Many kinds of proposed optical MEMS
and micromechanical photonics devices are seen, and the fabrication of mole-
cular devices is the ﬁnal goal in the ﬁgure.
It is apparent from the ﬁgure that there are two development directions ow-
ing to miniaturization. First, as the device/system size decreases, the number
of functions decreases, for example, from an MDF (exchanger: main distribut-
ing frame) to an optical disk system to optical interconnection to an actuator
and to a sensor. It is a natural direction and has led to the commercializa-
tion of many products (white circles), as seen in the ﬁgure. Second, as the
device/system size decreases the number of functions increases, for example,
from a sensor to an optical resonator to an electrostatic motor to an opti-
cal motor and to a molecular device. It is an ideal and a research-oriented

direction, in which many devices are under development (black circles), as
seen in the same ﬁgure.
Much work is needed to reach the ﬁnal goal. Good mechanical properties,
high speed, and strong power are foreseen for microdevices. Microassembly,
packing, and wiring techniques must be improved. Tribology on the microscale
must be studied to realize smooth motion.
In the following chapters, we highlight key technologies in the development
of future optical MEMS/micromechanical photonics devices and describe not
only theoretical and experimental results but also their ﬁelds of application.
Chap. 2 deals with LD closely aligned with a microstructure such as a di-
aphragm, a microcantilever and a slider. As examples, we examine extremely
short-external-cavity LDs such as a tunable LD, a resonant sensor and an
integrated optical head. Chap. 3 addresses optical tweezers. The new technol-
ogy is employed to manipulate various types of objects in a variety of research
and industrial ﬁelds. Chap. 4 deals with the design and fabrication of an op-
tical rotor and the evaluation of the mixing performance of microliquids for a
future ﬂuidic applications such as µ-TAS. In Chap. 5, the fundamentals and
applications of the near ﬁeld induced on an object surface are described for
the future development of micromechanical photonics. This technology en-
ables us to carry out observing, reading/writing, and fabrication beyond the
wavelength resolution by accessing and controlling the near ﬁeld.

Extremely Short-External-Cavity Laser Diode
In this chapter, we deal with laser diodes closely aligned with a microstruc-
ture including a diaphragm, a cantilever and a slider. New functional and
sophisticated microdevices are given by closely aligning or integrating the
microstructure with a laser diode, which does not require a lens system.
2.1 Background
Extremely short-external-cavity laser diodes (ESEC LDs) have been demon-
strated for monitoring reﬂectivity [2.1] and displacement [2.2]. Tunable LD
[2.3] are also demonstrated with an ESEC conﬁguration. ESEC LDs include
desirable properties for optical communication, optical data storage, spec-
troscopy, and a variety of sensing and measurement systems.
A surface-emitting LD with a micromechanical reﬂector has been used for
tuned devices [2.4–2.6]. The structure is designed to have an air-gap of approx-
imately one wavelength. When a voltage is applied to the membrane reﬂector,
the electrostatic force reduces the air-gap, which changes the wavelength. An
edge-emitting laser diode is also applicable for the micromechanically tunable
laser [2.7,2.8]. By varying the external cavity length, the laser wavelength can
be easily changed. However, to date the experimental data of the ESEC LD
under various coupled conditions have been poor.
Some studies have reported special considerations for such a short-
external-cavity LD based on butt coupling into an optical ﬁber [2.9]. In
a short-external-cavity LD system, the feedback light must return to an ap-
proximately 1-µm diameter LD aperture, although it is diﬃcult in practice
to align the light beam with such micrometer-level accuracy, and it is more
diﬃcult to maintain this accuracy for a long period against external envi-
ronmental perturbations [2.10]. One possible solution is automatic alignment
using an air bearing slider which has the same ﬂying mechanism as that of a
magnetic hard disk drive (HDD).

32
2 Extremely Short-External-Cavity Laser Diode
In this chapter, we deal with LDs closely aligned with a microstructure
including a diaphragm, a cantilever and a slider. By closely aligning or inte-
grating the microstructure with an LD, which does not require a lens system,
new functional and sophisticated microdevices can be developed.
In the following, we analyze the ESEC LD by introducing the eﬀective
reﬂectivity of the laser facet facing the external mirror. Then a measurement
method that uses an LD attached to a ﬂying slider and a semitransparent
rotating disk mirror for an extremely short-external-cavity conﬁguration is
presented. Then as practical applications, a tunable LD, a resonant sensor, an
integrated optically switched laser head are introduced from the viewpoint of
their composition, principle, basic characteristics, and fabrication methods.
2.2 Theoretical Analysis
The lasing behavior for an ESEC LD with a feedback light has not yet been
clariﬁed because of the complexity of the many parameters involved [2.9,
2.11]. In this section, we analyze the composite resonant phenomena under
the strong light feedback. We ﬁrst analyze a solitary LD and then an ESEC
LD by introducing the eﬀective reﬂectivity facet facing the external mirror.
2.2.1 Lasing Condition of a Solitary LD
A laser diode (LD) consists of an active region of (n, β, g, α) and two mirrors
with the reﬂectivities R1 and R2 separated at the length of L as shown in
Fig. 2.1, where n is the refractive index, β is the propagation constant, g
is the gain and α is the extinction coeﬃcient. The active region with a pn
junction semiconductor is in the state of population inversion in the energy
levels. Among the photons emitted spontaneously in all directions, only the
photons traveling along the axis of the resonator (incident to the mirrors

but they are decayed per pass by

(2.2)
The lasing condition is that the product of (2.1) and (2.2) is larger than 1,
namely
e2gLe−2αLR1R2 ≥1.

where α = 10 cm−1, L = 300 µm, R1 = R2 = 0.32, then gth ≥49 cm−1
The light travels in the active region inﬁnitesimally to establish a high
value of radiation density. The lasing light in the resonator generates the
standing wave ﬁelds. Since the integral multiple m of the half-wavelength
equals the cavity length L
λ
2nm = L.
(2.5)
When λ = 1.3 µm, n = 3.5 and L = 300 µm, the integer m equals 1615. The
wavelength diﬀerence ∆λ when m increases by 1 becomes
∆λ = −

2neﬀL,
(2.6)
where neﬀis the eﬀective refractive index of the LD. In terms of wave numbers,
the frequencies are separated by an interval of 1/∆λ. The calculated mode
interval of ∆λ equals 0.76 nm for λ = 1.3 µm, neﬀ= 3.7, and L = 300 µm.
The lasing-mode shift corresponds to the integral multiple of ∆λ.

Fig. 2.2. Extremely short-external-cavity LD (ESEC LD) system which consists of
the LD facet reﬂectivities R1, R2, and the external mirror reﬂectivity R3 (a), and
introduced eﬀective reﬂectivity Reﬀ

instead of R2 and R3 (b). We can analyze the
behavior of the ESEC LD by analyzing the solitary LD with a resonator composed
of R1 and Reﬀ
2
R1, the LD facet reﬂectivity R2 facing the external mirror, the external mirror
reﬂectivity R3, and the LD drive current. Figure 2.2a shows the ESEC LD
system. The light emits from R2, reﬂects back at R3, and returns into the
LD. The returned light changes the carrier density (refractive index) and
the gain spectrum of the internal cavity medium of the LD, which leads to
complicated behavior of the ESEC LD. To analyze this behavior more easily
we introduce the eﬀective reﬂectivity Reﬀ
2
which has equivalent eﬀect to the
coupled R2 and R3. Then we can analyze the behavior of the ESEC LD by
analyzing the solitary LD composed of a resonator with R1 and Reﬀ

in Fig. 2.2b.

2.2.3 Light Output
Figure 2.3 shows the dependence of coupling eﬃciency η on external-cavity-
length Lex. The beam waists are (1) 2wx0 = 2.54 µm, 2wy0 = 1.38 µm and
(2) 2wx0 = 5.0 µm, 2wy0 = 0.5 µm. Beam waist (1) corresponds to the light
divergent angles of 10◦in the x direction and 25◦in the y direction which are
typical for commercially available LDs. In the ﬁgure, we show the coupling
eﬃciency of 50% at the external length of 3.5 µm for the LD with beam waist
(1) which is used in the experiment presented in Sect. 2.2.4.
For a typical LD, the dependence of Reﬀ
2
on Lex is calculated using (2.7)
and (2.8), and is shown in Fig. 2.4 for R1 = 0.32 and R2 = 0.01, with R3 as a
parameter. It is clear from the ﬁgure that Reﬀ
2
changes every half-wavelength
(λ/2) and decreases as Lex increases. The light output and the wavelength of
the ESEC LD vary as Reﬀ
2
changes according to Lex.
2.2.4 Wavelength
The wavelength of the ESEC LD can be determined by the lasing conditions
of a solitary LD composed of two mirrors with the amplitude reﬂectivity r1
and reﬀ
2 . A light emitted from the left mirror at z = 0 travels along the z-axis
and is given by
E(z, t) = E0 exp [j(ωt −β1z)]

occurs at frequency f when the internal mode frequency fm1 coincides with
the external mode frequency fm2 in the gain spectrum curve, that is,

Figure 2.6 shows the relationship between the wavelength and the cavity
length. Notations λu and λl on the vertical axis show the upper and lower
gains (gain spectrum range) and λL/2 on the horizontal axis shows the half-
wavelength interval. The internal cavity mode m1 does not depend on Lex.
The external cavity mode m2 is shown as the lines of the gradient 2/m2. The
intersections between the two modes indicate the lasing wavelengths. As a
result, the internal cavity mode wavelength in the gain spectrum (λu, λl) is
lased discontinuously at the λL/2 period according to the Lex change.
Carrier Density Dependence
The carrier density N in the semiconductor is changed due to the returned
light, which leads to variation in the refractive index and the gain spectrum.
As a result the wavelength changes with the variation of the external-cavity-
length Lex.
The peak wavelength λG giving the maximum gain spectrum decreases
linearly as N increases and its variation ratio is given by [2.12]
∂λ
∂N ≈−6 × 10−24 (cm4).
(2.24)
The refractive index variation ratio ∂n/∂N as aﬀected by the carrier density
is given on the basis of a consideration of λ = 2L/m and L = nL0,

Equation (2.26) shows that ∂λ∂Lex is inversely proportional to Reﬀ
2
and is
proportional to the eﬀective reﬂectivity variation ∂Reﬀ
2 ∂Lex. Figure 2.7 shows
an example of the wavelength variation dependence on the external cavity
length. Of course, the total wavelength change due to the external cavity
length depends on the eﬀects of both the mode change and the carrier density
change.
In summary, to analyze the wavelength of the ESEC LD, it is necessary to
know the eﬀective reﬂectivity, carrier density variation, and the gain spectrum
variation due to the light returned from the external mirror. Furthermore, the
wavelength depends on the temperature and the drive current. These factors
have not yet been fully analyzed theoretically. In the next section we will
describe the experimental analysis of the ESEC LD.
2.3 Experimental Analysis
In this section a measurement method that uses an LD attached to a ﬂying
slider and a semitransparent rotating disk mirror for an ESEC conﬁguration
is presented. Not only the wavelength, but also the spectrum and the light
output are measured at room temperature, with the external-cavity-length

42
2 Extremely Short-External-Cavity Laser Diode
Lex, the reﬂectivities of the LD facets and external mirror, and the drive
current as parameters. As a result, wavelength tuning as great as 30 nm by
varying the external-cavity length is conﬁrmed for a 1.3-µm wavelength LD
with an antireﬂection coating on the LD facet facing the external mirror.
2.3.1 Experimental Setup
Some aspects of the feedback eﬀect for an ESEC LD conﬁguration are mea-
sured by the following method [2.13]. An extremely short external cavity
was realized when an LD on a slider ﬂew on a semitransparent optical disk.
Figure 2.8 illustrates the experimental setup (upside down in reality) for mon-
itoring the wavelength-related behavior of an LD by means of an integrated
photodiode (PD) which is mounted on a ﬂying slider. The InGaAsP/InP LD
is isolated from the PD by reactive ion beam etching. The cavity length of
the LD is 300 µm and the space between the LD and the PD is 5 µm. The
monitor current sensitivity is 0.1 mA/mW.
Automatic and stable alignment is accomplished by the air bearing, which
maintains a spacing ranging from submicrometers up to several micrometers
depending on the disk velocity. The external-cavity-length Lex (= L0
ex + L1
ex)
is 2–4.5 µm long in this experiment, where L0
ex is the ﬂying height that varies
according to the square root of the disk velocity and L1
ex is an LD–PD attach-
ment error to the slider surface.
Light transmitted through the semitransparent optical disk is directed
into an optical spectrum analyzer (Anritsu, MS96A) through an optical ﬁber
placed opposite to the LD–PD. The corresponding laser power variation is
monitored with the PD integrated on the LD.
The LD coupled with an optical disk forms a composite cavity LD as shown
in Fig. 2.9a. Figure 2.9b shows a photograph of the monolithically integrated
LD-PD chip on a slider. Optical feedback is varied by the external cavity
length (disk rotation rate), the reﬂectivity of the LD facet facing the optical

R1 is 0.32 (cleaved facet), R2 is 0.01 (antireﬂection coating) [2.14], and the
disk reﬂectivities R3 are 0.04, 0.26, and 0.50.
In order to reduce the attachment error L1
ex between the LD facet and the
slider surface, an LD–PD was mounted on the slider surface by the following
method. First, the LD–PD chip was pushed onto the electrode of the slider’s
back end with vacuum tweezers and then rotated to align it parallel to the
slider surface as shown in Fig. 2.10a. The parallelism was monitored using a
He–Ne laser beam.
Second, the moving stage on which the LD–PD chip was mounted was
translated, as shown in Fig. 2.10b, along the laser beam axis with an accuracy
of 0.05 µm to minimize the following error signal. The attachment error was
detected by a range sensor, called an optical lever, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The

Finally, the LD–PD chip was bonded precisely by melting a thin ﬁlm solder
in H2–N2 gas. Figure 2.12 shows photographs of an LD–PD bonded onto the
electrode on the back end of the slider (a), and an enlarged view of the LD–PD
facet and the slider surface (b).
2.3.2 Light Output
To analyze the feedback light eﬀects speciﬁc to the ESEC LD conﬁguration,
we ﬁrst measured the threshold current. The maximum light output versus
drive current (I–L characteristics) with an external mirror is presented in
Fig. 2.13, where R1 = 0.32 and R2 = 0.01. The light was detected by a PD
placed at the opposite facet of the LD. The threshold current of the ESEC
LD with feedback light is signiﬁcantly reduced for the antireﬂection-coated LD
(R2 = 0.01). These coupled LD operations were calculated for the steady-state
operation using the rate equations.
The light output versus external-cavity-length Lex is shown in Fig. 2.14,
with drive current I/Ith as a parameter. The light output coupled to the
external mirror depends not only on Lex, but also on the reﬂectivities of the

Using the eﬀective reﬂectivity Reﬀ

diﬀerence and Reﬀ

Fig. 2.15. The light output diﬀerence increases as Reﬀ

increases.
2.3.3 Wavelength and Spectrum Characteristics
Wavelength tuning due to the strong light feedback is shown in Fig. 2.16 for the
antireﬂection-coated LD where the drive current (normalized by the threshold
current) I/Ith = 1.8, reﬂectivities R1 = 0.32, R2 = 0.01, and R3 = 0.5. The
wavelength variation exhibits an asymmetric but λ/2 periodic behavior with
the external-cavity-length Lex. As Lex increases the wavelength increases lin-
early, similarly to the numbers (1)–(5), then remains similarly to the numbers
(6)–(8) in every period as shown in Fig. 2.16.

The spectral structure of the tuned light is shown in Fig. 2.17 correspond-
ing to the numbers in Fig. 2.16. The former numbers (1)–(5) show that single
longitudinal modes are tuned for the feedback light LD, while the latter num-
bers (6)–(8) show that multi modes are tuned for the feedback light LD.
Considering these two types of experimental tuning results, we ﬁnd that the
spectrum varies from single mode to multi mode according to the external
cavity length.
The separation between the longitudinal modes according to the LD’s
cavity length L is given by (2.6). The calculated mode interval of ∆λ equals
0.76 nm for λ = 1, 300 nm, neﬀ= 3.7, and L = 300 µm agrees well with the
above experimentally obtained result. The span of the lasing mode shifts with
the integral number times ∆λ.

becomes narrow as Reﬀ

In summary, an LD attached to a ﬂying slider and a rotating optical disk
mirror was used to measure the lasing characteristics for an ESEC LD. Not
only the wavelength, but also the spectrum including the side-mode suppres-
sion ratio, the spectrum line width and the mode interval were measured pre-
cisely by controlling the slider ﬂying height, with the reﬂectivities of the LD
facets and external mirror, and the drive current as parameters. As a result,

we successfully measured all the parameters related to the light feedback and
conﬁrmed a wavelength tuning range as great as 30 nm for an LD with an-
tireﬂection coating on the facet facing the external mirror. Furthermore, we
experimentally analyzed how the parameters of the coupling system aﬀect
the operation of the ESEC LD. A strongly coupled (low LD facet reﬂectivity
facing an external mirror and high mirror reﬂectivity) short external-cavity
length is the key to achieving a wide-range wavelength tuning.

without an optical bench [2.15]. ESEC LDs have been demonstrated in moni-
toring the reﬂectivity and displacement. Optical disk bits are read out in the
near ﬁeld from the diﬀerence in medium reﬂectivity with an antireﬂection-
coated LD and a PD [2.16]. Tunable LD can also be demonstrated in an
ESEC conﬁguration [2.4–2.6]. They include desirable properties for optical
communication, optical data storage, spectroscopy, and a variety of sensing
and measuring systems.
For micromechanical photonics applications using LDs, group III–V com-
pounds are predominant for the monolithic integration of external microstruc-
tures. They include a tunable laser [2.5], a resonant sensor [2.17], and an
optical head [2.18] which can provide super-small, cost eﬀective microdevices.
Such a small distance allows the use of a lensless system, which makes it eas-
ier to fabricate. The following micromechanical photonics devices employ a
friction-less mechanism including a diaphragm, a cantilever and a slider in
order to avoid microscale problems.

2.4.1 Tunable LD
A vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) diode or a light-emitting
diode (LED) with a micromechanical reﬂector can be used in tuned de-
vices [2.4,2.5]. The structure is designed to have an air gap of approximately
one wavelength. When a voltage is applied to the membrane reﬂector, the
electrostatic force reduces the air gap, which in turn reduces the wavelength.
An edge-emitting LD is also applicable for micromechanically tunable LDs
[2.7]. Recent micromachining technology has made it easy to eliminate the
need for lens and ﬁber systems for guiding the light to a PD or a moving
mechanism, leading to the integration of optics, mechanics, and electronics.
Structure
The edge-emitting tunable laser diode consists of a laser diode LD1, a
microcantilever MC driven photothermally by an LD2 (Fig. 1.28). The light
emitted from LD2 onto the side wall of the MC is partially absorbed, heating

2.4 Applications
51
the MC and producing the bending moment. At resonant frequency, the MC
is excited easily due to the thermal stress caused by a pulsed laser beam from
LD2. This sideways vibration varies the external-cavity-length Lex between
the MC wall and the LD1 facet, and there is so little incident light from the
LD1 that it has no eﬀect on the MC vibration. The variation of Lex causes
the wavelength shift of the LD1.
Manufacturing Method
An MC and the LDs were fabricated on a GaAs substrate. There are three
micromachining processes involved in fabricating the MC (1) an etch-stop
layer of AlGaAs is formed in the LD structure prepared by metalorganic vapor
phase epitaxy (MOVPE).(2) The microstructure shape is precisely deﬁned by
a reactive dry-etching (RIBE) technique, which can simultaneously form the
vertical etched mirror facets for LDs. (3) A wet-etch window is formed with
photoresist and the MC is undercut by selective etching to leave the MC freely
suspended (Fig. 1.11) [2.19].
These processes are compatible with laser fabrication, and thus an MC
structure can be fabricated at the same time as an LD structure. Furthermore,
because a single crystal epitaxial layer carries little residual stress, precise mi-
crostructures can be obtained without signiﬁcant deformation. We fabricated
an MC with an area of 400 × 700 µm. The MC was 3 µm wide, 5µm high and
110 µm long. The shorter the MC–LD2 distance becomes, the higher the pho-
tothermal conversion eﬃciency. The threshold current of the LD was 46 mA.
Figure 2.23 shows the main parts of the tunable LD. The hole for wet etching
is visible under the MC between LD1 and LD2.
Monolithic integration of optics and micromechanics is possible not only
on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate [2.19], but also on an indium phos-
phide (InP) substrate [2.20,2.21]. A smooth, etched surface and a deep vertical
sidewall are necessary for good lasing characteristics of both types of semi-
conductor microstructures.
Basic Characteristics
In a micromechanically tunable LD, the moving part (MC) was integrated
with an edge-emitting LD. By varying the external cavity length (MC deﬂec-
tion), the laser wavelength can be easily changed and the wavelength shift
varied every half-wavelength (λ/2). Therefore, the MC must move more than
λ/2 even at oﬀ-resonant frequencies. In Sect. 2.5.1, we present the design of
the MC structure that satisﬁes photothermal deﬂection of greater than λ/2.
We have experimentally analyzed how the parameters of the coupling sys-
tem aﬀect the ESEC LD operation by using a rotating optical disk and an LD
attached to a ﬂying slider. The parameters included the reﬂectivities of the
LD facets, the reﬂectivity of the external mirror, and the LD drive current.
We conﬁrmed a 30 nm tuning range around a wavelength of 1.3 µm, as shown

ﬂection coating on the facet facing the external mirror. On the basis of these
results, we consider that by employing the MC design and the fabrication
method described earlier, a photothermally driven micromechanical tunable
LD will be available in the future.
2.4.2 Resonant Sensor
A resonant sensor is a device that changes its mechanical resonant frequency
as a function of a physical or chemical parameter, such as stress or mass-
loading [2.22]. Electrostatic (capacitive) excitation and detection or piezo-
electric excitation and detection have been used in conventional silicon-based
resonant sensors. The former method requires comparatively large electrode
areas to obtain good signals, which presents diﬃculties at the microscale. The
latter requires a layer of a piezoelectric material, preferably zinc oxide (ZnO).
However, unfortunately, ZnO is not compatible with integration technology.
Structure
A resonant MC, LDs, and a PD have been fabricated on the surface of a GaAs
substrate, as shown in Fig. 2.24. The MC is excited photothermally by light
from one laser diode (LD2). With a PD, the vibration is detected as the light
output variation caused by the optical length diﬀerence between the MC and
another LD (LD1).
The resonator was designed to optimize the eﬃciency of the photothermal
excitation and the quality of the composite cavity signal with the structural

one side by LD2 and sensed optically from the other side by LD1 and photodiode
(PD1); LD2, MC, LD1, and PD1 are integrated on a GaAs substrate
conﬁguration resulting from the fabrication process. The distance h1 between
the facet of LD1 and the wall of the MC was set to 3.0 µm, on the basis of
the composite cavity signal SNR and the aspect ratio h1/w of the reactive
dry-etching process. The distance h2 between the facet of LD2 and the wall
of the MC was set to be 30 µm considering the energizing light absorption
on the MC, and the hole size for the wet process described later. The MC
dimensions were set to a length l = 50 µm and 110 µm, a thickness t = 3 µm,
and a width w = 5 µm, considering the resonant frequency of the MC. The
positions of the excitation light (LD2) and the detection light (LD1) on the
MC wall were chosen considering that the LD2 light strikes the MC closer to
the support for better excitation, and that the LD1 light strikes further from
the support for better detection as well as to prevent cross-talk between the
two light beams.
The short distances in the LD2–MC–LD1–PD structure are useful for a
vibration resonator because no lenses are required between LD1, MC, and
LD2 to make the light beam converge, so it is easier to integrate the mechan-
ical element with the optical elements. Furthermore, the integrated structure
does not need any optical alignment like that required by conventional hybrid
resonant sensors.
Basic Characteristics
The MC is excited by the resonant frequency due to the thermal stress caused
by a pulsed laser beam from LD2. This sideways vibration is detected by the
LD1 and the PD from the variation in the external cavity length between the
MC wall and the facet of LD1 (phase diﬀerence). Light incident from LD1
is continuous illumination and is so small that it has no eﬀect on the MC

Fig. 2.25. Maximum peaks in the light output occur every λ/2 and their amplitude

as a signal by the PD. Maximum peaks in the light output occur every λ/2 and
their amplitude decays exponentially to the external cavity length as shown
in Fig. 2.25. The variation in light output caused by this vibration is detected
by the PD.
Figure 2.26 shows that the signal amplitude increases as the LD2 light
power increases, but an inversion appears in the signal peak for the light
power over 30 mW, because the vibration amplitude is larger than λ/4. We
can determine the absolute amplitude on the basis of the fact that the peak
signal amplitude corresponds to λ/4 (0.21 µm). As the incident light power
rises, producing greater thermal expansion(stress) in the MC, the vibration
amplitude increases.
Figure 2.27 shows a photograph with diﬀerent excitation light posi-
tions. The MC deﬂections, ∆h1 (detecting side: LD1) and ∆h2 (excitation
side: LD2), were measured independently by the method described earlier.
Figure 2.28 shows the relationship between the deﬂection and the normalized
excitation position with a laser power of 9.5 mW. It is conﬁrmed that both
deﬂections increase as the light strikes the MC closer to the support, and
∆h1 is greater than ∆h2, probably due to the optical pressure exerted by the
light from LD2.
To measure the resonant properties, LD2 was lased by the current with
various frequencies. When the current frequency coincided with the MC

is applicable with a length of less than 20 µm(3 µm thick).
Possible applications are resonant frequency change detection type ac-
celerometers and gas sensors. Chemically inductive material phthalocyanine
was deposited of 1 µm thickness on the resonator as shown in Fig. 2.30. Then
the resonant frequency was changed by 500 Hz from 288.4 to 287.9 kHz due
to the mass increase of 54 ng corresponding to the 1-µm thick phthalocya-
nine deposition. It was conﬁrmed that the resonant sensitivity is very high
(Fig. 2.31). Both ﬁgures show the possibility of detecting a gas.
The yield strength of single crystalline GaAs is less than that of Si, but it
is ﬁve times greater than that of steel. Furthermore, micromachining can be
used to fabricate microstructures of high purity with a low defect density and
no residual stress. These mechanical properties mean that GaAs-based and
InP-based microstructures are suitable for use in integrated micromechanical
photonics systems.

2.4.3 Optically Switched Laser Head
In this section a small ﬂying optical head and its high quality readout charac-
teristics when used as an optically switched laser (OSL) head are described.
The basic concept involved the use of light emitted and collected through
a 1-µm diameter aperture of an LD placed less than 2 µm from a recording
medium (ESEC LD conﬁguration). For autofocus, the head operates like a
magnetic head: air-bearing technology stabilizes the slider ﬂying height ap-
proximately 1 µm as shown in Fig. 2.32. Controlled by a sampled servo track
error signal, the arm used to seek from track to track is also used for track
following as described later.
Drive Structure
A prototype drive consisting of a ﬂying head and a phase change medium
disk is constructed for experimental purposes. Figure 2.33 shows experimental
optical disk drive using an OSL head and a phase change recording medium:

An LD monolithically integrated with a PD is mounted junction-up on a
slider. Light reﬂects from the medium back into the active region of the LD.
Head-medium spacing h (between the LD facet and the GeSbTe recording
medium) is approximately 2 µm: the sum of the slider ﬂying height h0, LD–
PD attachment error h1, and the protective layer thickness h2.
Head Structure
A monolithically integrated LD–PD chip with a wavelength of 1.3 µm was
shown in Fig. 1.33. The LD is isolated from the PD by reactive ion beam
etching (RIBE). The space between LD and PD is about 5 µm and the monitor
current sensitivity is 0.1 mA/mW. The 1.2-µm-wide taper-ridged waveguide
on the top of the LD cavity was also fabricated by RIBE. FWHM of its near
ﬁeld pattern are approximately 1 µm as shown in Fig. 2.34. This sharpened LD
is useful for the ﬂying optical head because it does not require an additional
lens to converge the light beam, and hence does not lose power before reaching
the recording medium.
A long-wavelength (1.3 µm) InGaAsP LD (LD#1), reliable in air, can be
used in our ﬂying head because its spot diameter is mainly constrained by the
shape of the ridged waveguide [2.25]. A short-wavelength (0.83 µm) GaAlAs
LD (LD#2) could be used if its facets were covered with dielectric protective
ﬁlms to prevent oxidation in air.
Medium Structure
The optical disk is made up of multiple layers: SiN/GeSbTe/SiN/Au/SiN/glass
substrate as shown in Fig. 1.32. The ﬁrst SiN layer operates as a protective
ﬁlm for a head-medium reliability. The GeSbTe layer serves as the phase
change medium. The second SiN layer and the Au layer enhance the re-
ﬂectivity change and the thermal diﬀusion speed of the recording medium.

Basic Read/Write Operation
The LD used in an optically switched laser (OSL) head forms a complex cavity
with the recording medium acting as an external mirror. In Fig. 2.35a, R1 and
R2 are the power reﬂectivities of the LD facets, and Rh
3 and Rl
3 are those of the
two states for the external recording medium. Reﬀ
2
is the eﬀective reﬂectivity
coupled with the external recording medium. Figure 2.35b shows the light
output versus bias current in the two medium reﬂectivity states. There are
two threshold currents: Ih
th for the high reﬂectivity Rh
3 and Il
th for the low
reﬂectivity Rl
3 . Data bits are read as the light output diﬀerence between the
two states.
Data bits are written, in this experiment, as the laser-induced phase change
shifts the medium reﬂectivity from Rl
3 (as depo. state) to Rh
3(crystal state).
During the write operation, the light output changes from Pw to P ′
w at a
ﬁxed write current of Iw according to the reﬂectivity change. The light output
diﬀerence P ′
R −PR (nearly equals to P ′
w −Pw) is less than 1 mW, which does
not destroy the information even if the medium stops. If the light output
were 20 mW, the variation ratio in the write process would be only 5%. We,
thereby achieve stable write operation. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and light output from the medium side laser facet, the medium side
LD facet is coated with an antireﬂection ﬁlm of (SiO)x (Si3N4)1−x [2.14].
Data Signal
Data signals are obtained by the light output diﬀerence due to the medium
reﬂectivity. Varying the medium reﬂectivity R3 as a parameter, Figs. 2.36a

Fig. 2.36. OSL head light output characteristics with the medium reﬂectivity R3
as a parameter for (a) an LD#1 (λ = 1.3 µm), (b) an LD#2 (λ = 0.83 µm)
and b plot the light output characteristics of the OSL head for LD#1 and
LD#2, respectively. These values are calculated for the steady state single-
mode operation by using the rate equations [2.26].
The external cavity can be described by replacing medium side laser facet
reﬂectivity R2 by eﬀective reﬂectivity Reﬀ
2 . The reﬂectivities R2, R3, and
the coupling coeﬃcient η are included in Reﬀ
2 . We deﬁne η as (2.8). As for
an LD#2, Gaussian half-power beam width 250 (2ws0 = 1.38 µm) and 100
(2wp0 = 2.54 µm), η is 0.5 for h = 2 µm and 0.75 for h = 1 µm.
Since the LD facet reﬂectivity R2 facing the medium is greatly reduced by
an antireﬂection coating to improve the SNR, the light output P1 (PD side)
diﬀers from P2 (medium side). The light output ratio for a complex cavity
laser is calculated using eﬀective reﬂectivity Reﬀ
2
instead of R2, as shown in
Problem 2.3. For example, with h = 2, P2/P1 = 1.5 for R1 = 0.32, R2 = 0.01,
and R3 = 0.3; P2/P1 = 5 for R1 = 0.70, R2 = 0.01, and R3 = 0.3 (see
Fig. A.3). We used these ratios to estimate read/write power P2 from the
measured light output P1.
Track Error Signal
Since OSL head has only one PD, track error signals are obtained by the sam-
pled servo method instead of the push–pull method for the continuous servo.
Sampled servo method is expected to give good stability and compatibility.
Discrete block format (DBF) [2.27] marks with a 1.6-µm track-pitch are
reproduced by the OSL ﬂying head as shown in Fig. 2.37. They are preformat-
ted on the glass substrate in phase pits. Figure 2.37a shows a DBF mark with
two access codes and three patterns, diﬀerent in phase, that correspond to the
wobble A (WA), clock (CLK), and wobble B (WB). Figure 2.37b shows repro-
duced signals. Each pulse composed of ﬁve peaks, represents the servo signals
(DBF mark) at the beginning of each 1,672 block per revolution. The third
and the ﬁfth peaks are wobbling signals, WA and WB, whose marks are dis-
placed +1/4 and −1/4 pitches from the track center. Track error signals were

diameter of the lensless but taper-ridged waveguide LD is small enough to

Reducing Laser Noise by Optimizing Bias Current
The SNR of the OSL ﬂying head is high because of the large signal amplitude
due to laser switching and the lack of feedback laser noise due to the external
cavity being so much shorter (2 µm) than the LD cavity (300 µm). The SNR
is degraded, however, by ﬂuctuation of both high- and low-frequency light
output. The former is caused by laser noise due to mode competition, while
the latter is caused by variation of head-medium spacing (external cavity
length) and of temperature.

curves calculated using a plane wave approximation
The SNR degradation due to high-frequency laser noise can be reduced
by increasing the diﬀerence between Il
th and Ih
th, e.g., by reducing reﬂectivity
of the medium side LD facet, and also by biasing the current between noise
peaks located around threshold currents. This laser facet was therefore coated
with an (SiO)x(Si3N4)1−x antireﬂection ﬁlm by ion beam sputtering using a
high purity silicon target and mixed O2–N2 discharges. Figure 2.39 shows the
reﬂectivity of diﬀerent ﬁlms obtained by controlling gas ﬂow rates to minimize
reﬂectivity. Reﬂectivities less than 1 × 10−4 are reproducibly obtained.
To ascertain the optimum drive condition, the data signal amplitude and
the SNR were measured with eﬀective noise deﬁned as the rms of the noise
spectrum from 40 kHz to 20 MHz. An SNR peak, between the threshold cur-
rents corresponding to Ith
l and Ith
h, increases as facet reﬂectivity decreases.
In a medium static condition, the SNR reaches 56 dB at a facet reﬂectivity
of R2 = 7.0 × 10−3. In a dynamic condition, it is 35 dB, which has been pre-
viously reported to be adequate for an optical disk drive. Reﬂectivity of the
coated facet was estimated from the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission spectrum
by the Fabry–Perot modulation depth method [2.28].
Reducing the Variation in Light Output
Degradation of the SNR due to variation of head-medium spacing can be
compensated by reducing interference between the internal and the feedback
lights. This can be done by reducing the laser facet reﬂectivity facing the
recording medium.

length Lex. Light output varies by a half-wavelength period as Lex varies (a). Vari-
ation can be suppressed by an antireﬂection coating on the LD facet facing the
recording medium (b)
Figure 2.40 shows a typical suppression of light output variation induced
by reducing facet reﬂectivity (medium reﬂectivity R3 = 0.30). The variation
using an uncoated LD (left side) with a facet reﬂectivity of R2 = 0.32 is
extremely high due to strong interference between internal and feedback light,
both of which have almost the same intensity. Using an antireﬂection-coated
LD (right ﬁgure), on the other hand, with extremely low reﬂectivity of R2 =
1 × 10−4 weakens interference and greatly reduces variation of light output.
Figure 2.41 shows the relationship between facet reﬂectivity R2 and the
variation ratio F, deﬁned as the ratio of the amplitude change. The variation
ratio decreases as R2 decreases. At a facet reﬂectivity R2 = 1 × 10−4, the
variation ratio was reduced to the extremely small value of 1.6 compared to
9.2 for an uncoated LD.
Increasing Thermal Write Power
Laser power density on the medium is increased not only by the taper-ridged
waveguide laser, but also by the highly thermally conductive slider and the re-
duction of LD–PD attachment error. Light output is higher for the slider with
the higher thermal conductivity (AlN) than the lower thermal conductivity
(sapphire). Not only the thermal property but also the electrical properties,
precise fabrication, and head/medium reliability must be considered when
choosing a slider material. We used an AlN slider for the following experi-
ments.
As the head-medium spacing decreases the light output increases due to
increased light feedback. The spacing h, set at 2 µm to keep the beam diameter
bellow 1 µm, is the sum of the slider ﬂying height h0, LD–PD attachment error
h1 (facet-to-slider surface error), and the protective-layer thickness h2. Since
h0 = 0.9 µm and h2 = 0.24 µm in this experiment, h1 must be < 0.9 µm. We

Write Performance
Figure 2.42 shows the dependence of write frequency on written bit patterns
for 16 mW light pulses with a duty cycle of 50%. These bits were written as
spots crystallized from the as-deposited state in this experiment. The phase
change was caused by the thermal energy of the light output with a ﬁxed
write current. This ﬁgure suggests that both the bit shapes and the levels of
crystalization are uniform. Bit pitch was 2.4 µm at a write frequency of 1 MHz.
These bits are readout with a high SNR as the medium reﬂectivity changed
between the two states (shown in the lower traces). The medium velocity here

Reliability Test
In an actual disk drive, contact between the slider and the disk is inevitable.
We therefore identify a combination of slider and protective layer materials
that reduces wear (scratching) during contact start/stop (CSS).
We have investigated experimentally the protective ﬁlms such as silicon-
dioxyside (SiO2), zinc-sulﬁde (ZnS), and silicon-nitride (SiN). We also evalu-
ated their thermal conductivity for writing sensitivity and thermal expansion
diﬀerence between the multi layers described earlier. The SiN protective layer
had smallest amount of scratch caused by repeated CSS with the AlN slider.
Fabrication of the ﬁlm was also studied with regard to internal stress and ad-
hesion strength. The ﬁlms, containing hydrogen atoms a-SiN:H (hydrogenated
amorphous silicon nitride), showed good write sensitivity. Its mechanical prop-
erty is also good because it has a high tensile force and resists scratching.
Figure 2.44 is an SEM photograph of the LD facet after 10,000 CSS
cycles (900 rpm) in an oﬃce environment (class 350,000). The disk has a
SiN/GeSbTe/SiN/Plastic substrate structure. Protuberance dust (particles)
adheres to the LD facet. The chemical composition of twelve randomly selected
samples of protuberance dusts, analyzed by ¨Auger electron spectroscopy, is
primarily C, O, Al, Si, and S, that is, the dust element included in the air.
The elements from slider and protective layer are included only two of the 12
dusts (samples). These results indicate very small amount of slider/disk wear
were produced even if scratch on the medium can not be seen with an optical
microscope.
The LD–PD reliability and the dust in the air is evaluated by free-running
test at 3,600 rpm, 4 mW light power, and with h0 = 1 µm in an experimental
room environment (class 30,000). This test shows that the head has a lifetime
(before bias current increases by 20%) of 2,040 h. This corresponds to 4.4 ×
108 passes. Contact start/stop (CSS) test, bias current for constant signal
amplitude versus the number of CSS cycles, shows that the head signal is

substrate structure and is used at low rotation of 900 rpm
still good after more than 50,000 cycles in a class 30,000 environment (30,000
particles larger than 0.5 µm/ft−3).
The main factors contributing to the high reliability of the head/medium
interface are the oxidation-free InGaAsP LD–PD, the high thermal conduc-
tivity of the slider, and the low residual stress and high adhesion strength
of the SiN protective layer on the recording medium. Moreover, as the LD
facet is about 1 µm behind the slider surface, it does not directly contact the
medium.
The small optical head with only an LD–PD on a slider shows ex-
cellent read/write characteristics and reliability. An antireﬂection-coated
LD combined with a taper-ridged waveguide has a high-SNR readout and
high-resolution write-down performance. An oxidation-free InGaAsP LD
(λ = 1.3 µm), a high thermal conductivity AlN slider, and a SiN pro-
tective layer (0.24 µm) on a phase change recording medium contribute
to the high reliability of this ﬂying optical head. Some kind of cartridge
mechanism or dust-wiping method should be developed to allow removal
and replacement of the recording medium. For high-performance use,
a high-speed track following method and a multibeam head should be
developed.

2.5.1 Enlargement of a Photothermal MC Deﬂection
for a Tunable LD
A photothermally driven MC tunable LD that needs no electrode to apply
voltage has been proposed. The advantages of the optical method in such in-
tegrated systems are that it is controlled remotely and not aﬀected by electro-
magnetic interference; these factors are especially critical for highly integrated
devices.

68
2 Extremely Short-External-Cavity Laser Diode
This section describes the increase in photothermal deﬂection of an MC
by employing a bimorph and an antireﬂection structure. This deﬂection can
be expected to exceed half a wavelength, which is required for a tunable
LD, by the temperature increase of 100◦C with an optical absorption rate
above 98%. An antireﬂection coating of Au/Si3N4/Au on the Au and Si3N4
bimorph structure semiconductor MC provides enhanced deﬂection about 500
times greater than that of the solitary semiconductor MC at oﬀ-resonant
frequencies. The designed MC monolithically integrated on InP (λ = 1.3 µm)
or GaAs (λ = 0.83 µm) will be used for an external-cavity length-changing
type edge-emitting tunable LD.
Design Considerations
An MC and LDs were fabricated on the surface of a GaAs substrate, as shown
in Fig. 2.23. The light emitted from the LD2 onto the side wall of the MC
is partially absorbed, heating the MC and producing the bending moment.
When the MC is excited at the resonant frequency by the thermal stress caused
by a modulated laser beam from LD2, the external cavity length between the
MC wall and the LD1 facet varies suﬃciently, but insuﬃciently at oﬀ-resonant
frequencies. That variation of the external cavity length causes the wavelength
change of the LD1.
By varying the external cavity length, the laser wavelength can be easily
changed and the wavelength varies every λ/2. Therefore, an MC deﬂection
of more than λ/2 is necessary for the tunable LD, even at an oﬀ-resonant
frequency. Meanwhile, the light absorption should be increased to obtain a
suﬃcient temperature rise for the large thermal strain. A bimorph structure
and an antireﬂection coating are applied to satisfy these requirements. The
following describes the enhanced MC photothermal deﬂection design for GaAs
and InP materials.
Bimorph Design
Figure 2.45 shows the calculated relationship between photothermal deﬂection
and thickness for a solitary GaAs MC. The tip deﬂection d at the free end of
the MC is estimated by (2.28), where α is the thermal expansion coeﬃcient,
δT is the temperature diﬀerence between the surfaces of the MC illuminated
by an LD, l and t are the length and thickness of the MC, respectively [2.29].
d = αl2
2t δT
(2.28)
Tip deﬂection d depends largely on the absorption coeﬃcient (varies λ/2 due
to the interference between the upper and lower surfaces) of the laser light
and reaches 0.8 nm when illuminated with 1 mW of power.
We designed a metal-dielectric bimorph structure to increase the MC de-
ﬂection by increasing in temperature resulting from absorption of light emitted

Fig. 2.46. Schematic drawing of a three-layer bimorph MC
by the LD2. Tip deﬂection is enhanced by the temperature rise from room
temperature due to the thermal coeﬃcient of expansion mismatch between
two sandwiched components. The MC is made, for example, of a 0.1-µm gold
(Au) layer, a 0.1-µm Si3N4 dielectric layer and a 2-µ m thick semiconductor
LD layer. Next, we developed a bimetallic MC deﬂection model [2.30] into a
three-layer MC as follows.
The MC is composed of three layers of thickness t1, t2, t3, thermal ex-
pansion coeﬃcients α1, α2, α3, the Young’s moduli E1, E2, E3, a length of l
and a width of b as shown in Fig. 2.46. Temperature distribution within the
MC is assumed to be uniform and the temperature change from the room
temperature to be ∆T.
Figure 2.47 shows the deﬂection of the MC and internal thermal stress due
to temperature change. The internal stresses over the cross-section of material
i can be reduced to a tensile force Pi and couple moment Mi. Since the internal
forces and moments over any cross-section of the MC must be in equilibrium

Figure 2.48 shows the result of numerical simulation by the material para-
meters shown in Table 2.1. More than λ/2 deﬂection is possible for less than
2.2-µm thick semiconductor MC with 100◦C temperature increases for both
GaAs and InP LD. This provides enhanced deﬂection about 500 times greater
than the solitary semiconductor MC deﬂection shown in Fig. 2.46.
Figure 2.49 shows a contour map of MC deﬂection for GaAs LDs, Young’s
modulus E and the thermal expansion coeﬃcient α as parameters. In the
ﬁgure, the dotted line corresponds to the displacement of λ/2; this displace-
ment increases as the thermal expansion coeﬃcient and Young’s modulus
increases.
Antireﬂection Coating Design
By increasing the MC displacement by the temperature rise resulting from
the LD, the absorption of the light should be high. In this section we will
describe our design for an antireﬂection coating for the MC.

the Au(1) thickness as a parameter. Both ﬁgures show that R reaches zero
by changing the thickness of the Au(1) ﬁlm. The smallest R will be achieved
at the Si3N4 thickness of 366 nm at the wavelength 1.3 µm and 223 nm at
0.83 µm. Figure 2.52 shows the total absorption A and the total reﬂectivity
R of Au(1)/Si3N4/Au(2) versus the Au(1) thickness at the above mentioned

Figure 2.55 shows the deﬂection of a bimorph MC with the antireﬂection
coating, and Au(2) as a parameter. Deﬂection greater than λ/2 is possible
when Au(2) is thicker than 78 nm for InP (λ = 1.3 µm), and thicker than 81
nm for GaAs (λ = 0.83 µm) LDs. As a result, the ﬁnal ﬁve-layer MC design
with antireﬂection and bimorph structures is shown in Table 2.2.
We derived an analytical model for a ﬁve-layer semiconductor MC to pre-
dict beam deﬂection that occurs due to temperature changes caused by a laser
light. We conﬁrmed that the tip deﬂection of a bimorph MC (0.1-µm gold layer
and a 0.1-µm Si3N4 dielectric layer) with an antireﬂection coating is enhanced
by more than a half-wavelength to widen the tunable LD wavelength variation.

We produced a trial fabrication of the solitary semiconductor MC and LDs
on the surface of a GaAs substrate. The MC was 3 µm thick, 5 µm width and
110 µm long, with a resonant frequency of 200.6 kHz, and the LD operated
at the threshold current of 46 mA. We predict that with this MC design, a
30-nm wavelength variation will be possible for the photothermally driven
micromechanical tunable LD.
2.5.2 Reﬂectivity Design of LD and Disk Medium for an OSL
Head
An integrated optical head design is developed and its performance is as-
sessed through the evaluation of LD eﬃciency, write-erase power margin,
phase change medium sensitivity and permissible read power.
Design Method
The detailed parameter of the optically switched laser (OSL) head is shown
in Fig. 2.35. Here, R1 and R2 are the reﬂectivities of the LD, and Rl
3 and Rh
3
are those of the two states of the recording medium. They conﬁrm a complex
cavity laser. The spacing h between the laser facet and the medium surface
is 2 µm which is decided as that the FWHM beam width is less than 1 µm on
the medium.
The reﬂectivity R1 is improved by high reﬂectivity coating (HRC) to in-
crease the light output P2 for thermal recording, and the reﬂectivity R2 is
reduced to 0.01 by ARC to suppress the light output variation due to the spac-
ing. Figure 2.56 shows a design guideline. Due to the relatively large number
of free parameters, it is advantageous to ﬁrst decide
h = 2 µm,
(2.44)
R2 = 0.01
(2.45)
on the basis of the experimental results described above, and then to design
R1, Rh
3, and Rl
3 taking design tradeoﬀs into consideration.

Evaluation Criteria of the Design
The light output for a complex cavity LD is calculated as shown in Fig. 2.36
using eﬀective reﬂectivity Reﬀ
2
instead of R2. Data signals are obtained by the
light output diﬀerence due to the medium reﬂectivity of the two states. The
relationship between the light output diﬀerence and a medium high reﬂectivity
of Rh
3, with the medium reﬂectivity diﬀerence Rh
3 −Rl
3 as a parameter can
be calculated. Light output diﬀerence is an important parameter from the
permissible read power and write–erase power margins [2.33].
LD eﬃciency, as shown in Fig. 2.57, such as the maximized total light
output and medium sensitivity (absorption) also be considered. We proceed

Prefeared Reﬂectivity Design
Reﬂectivity design was performed for two kinds of LD; the wavelength of
LD#1 is 1.3 µm and LD#2 is 0.83 µm (LD#2 has a higher quantum eﬃciency
than LD#1). Appropriate choices are made for LDs and the phase change
medium from the criteria of (2.46)–(2.50).
As the eﬀective reﬂectivity Reﬀ
2
(medium reﬂectivity) decreases, the light
output ratio (P2/P1) increases, but the write-erase power margin (PW −P ′
E
and P ′
W −PE) decreases. The preferred medium reﬂectivities for LD#1 can
be chosen as follows:
R1 ≥0.7,
(2.51)
R2 ∼= 0.01,
0.21 ≥Rh
3 ≥0.14,
0.10 ≥Rh
3 −Rl
3 ≥0.02.

The preferred medium reﬂectivities for LD#2 can be chosen as follows:
R1 ≥0.7,
(2.52)
R2 ∼= 0.01,
0.21 ≥Rh
3 ≥0.14,
0.05 ≥Rh
3 −Rl
3 ≥0.02.
Compared with LD#2, LD#1 has advantages of a large permissible range
medium reﬂectivity, but has the disadvantage of temperature rise due to low
quantum eﬃciency.
In summary, the optimum design head consists of an LD facet with a
reﬂectivity of R1 ∼= 0.7 and R2 = 0.01, and a medium high reﬂectivity of
0.21 ≥Rh
3 ≥0.14. The reﬂectivity diﬀerence between the two states Rh
3−Rl
3 ∼=
0.05 and the spacing between laser facet and medium is 2 µm. This ﬂying
type optical head is now developing for the candidate of an ultra-high density
optical near ﬁeld storage (see Sect. 5.4.2).

Optical Tweezers
Solar radiation pressure causes manmade satellites to tilt in orbit and also
to induce the rotational bursting of meteorites and tektites in space. The
eﬀect of optical pressure appears notable even in daily life when an object be-
comes smaller than several micrometers. Optical tweezers are tools that use
optical pressure in trapping microobjects including living cells and microor-
ganisms, and also in directionally rotating artiﬁcial microobjects fabricated
by micromachining. Given their noninvasive nature, optical tweezers are use-
ful particularly in biological processes. Nowadays, these optical tweezers are
used to control and manipulate various types of micro/nanoobject in various
research and industrial ﬁelds.
In this chapter, we ﬁrst analyze the trapping eﬃciency of optical tweezers
using geometrical optics and then compare the results with those obtained in
experiments. Finally, we show the various applications of optical tweezers.
3.1 Background
Figure 3.1 shows a photograph of Halley’s comet taken on March 21, 1986 at
Nobeyama near Tokyo. The tail of the comet is said to be directed along the
direction of solar radiation pressure. An optical pressure force is very weak but
can be visualized as the tail of a comet in space. This force was measured on
earth soon after the laser was invented. The measurement method is illustrated
in Fig. 3.2 [3.1]. Small mirrors (vanes) were suspended by a gold wire in a
vacuum chamber. Pulsed light emitted from a ruby laser hits the ﬁrst vane,
and light reﬂected from the vane hits the second vane and passes through
an exit beam splitter. The reﬂection of the beam from both vanes generates
suﬃcient optical pressure force to tilt the vanes and the scale mirror ﬁxed to
the lower end of the suspension wire, which changes light deﬂection on the
scale. The experimental results were obtained in vaccum (10−5 Torr) under the
conditions listed in Table 3.1 to eliminate the thermal eﬀect of air molecules
induced by light absorption.

3.1 Background
83
Ashkin and his coworkers at ATT Bell Laboratory demonstrated a trap-
ping phenomenon due to the optical pressure force generated by counterpropa-
gating laser beams in the early 1970s [3.2]. There is a great deal of theoretical
and experimental knowledge and technology in this ﬁeld [3.3, 3.4]. Here, a
single-beam gradient-force optical trap is applied in various scientiﬁc and en-
gineering ﬁelds including biology [3.3,3.5], microchemistry [3.6], physics [3.7],
micromechanics [3.8]. It consists of a single beam that is strongly focused by
a high-numerical-aperture (high-NA) objective lens of a microscope.
Table 3.2 shows typical conditions for the optical trap and Table 3.3 shows
a list of the refractive indexes and densities of typical materials for trapping.
Optical trapping is possible not only for solid particles but also for liquid
particles and living cells, if they are transparent for the laser wavelength used
and the refractive indexes are slightly higher than that of the surrounding
medium. They include a droplet of paraﬃn wax (refractive index of 1.47) in
ethanol liquid (refractive index of 1.36). The droplet becomes larger at the
trapping position through successive droplet fusion. Another example is the
living cell of a blade of grass (weed). We can manipulate a mitochondrion in
the cell by illuminating and scanning it with a laser beam. Figure 3.3 shows
that we can transfer an optically trapped particle from one beam to another.
Masuhara et al. [3.9] developed a laser scanning micromanipulation
system and demonstrated the simultaneous trapping of multiple particles,
micrometer-size particle pattern formation, and driving of particles along the
patterns. Figure 3.4 shows that multiple particles are trapped by a single
laser beam and aligned in the designed pattern (Japanese character “light”)
formed by scanning the laser beam. This pattern can be moved or deformed
in the space according to the scanning pattern. Figure 3.5 shows that we can
trap particles so as to obtain a spatial light energy distribution pattern by
interference fringe, which increases the eﬃciency of particle manipulation.

3.2 Theoretical Analysis
85
Details of the analytical and experimental studies of the single-beam op-
tical trap are presented in the following sections.
3.2 Theoretical Analysis
Trapping force/eﬃciency can be calculated with either a ray optics (RO)
model [3.4] or an electromagnetic force (EM) model, as shown in Fig. 3.6 [3.10].
In the RO, a light beam is decomposed into individual rays with appropriate
intensity and direction. The total force on the sphere is computed from the
sum of the contributions of each ray entering the aperture. The RO model is
applicable only to an object much larger than the wavelength (Mie regime).
On the other hand, the EM model is applicable to an object much less than
the wavelength (Rayleigh regime).
The RO model is used in Chaps. 3 and 4 to calculate the optical trapping
force (on the piconewton order) exerted on a micrometer-size object. The
Brownian movement is also considered for the small sphere [3.11]. The EM
model is used in Chap. 5 for the nanometer-size object.
3.2.1 Optical Pressure
When a ray in a medium of refractive index n1 is incident to boundary with a
medium of index n2, what happens? Figure 3.7 shows reﬂected and refracted
rays, the angle of incidence θ1, reﬂection θ1, and refraction θ2 and the mo-
mentum of incidence Mi, reﬂection Mr, and refraction Mt. Optical pressure
force, that is, momentum change per second, acts as to conserve the momen-
tum of light at the interface. The direction of optical pressure is normal to
the surface because the momentum in the transverse direction is continuous
(Example 3.1).

Fig. 3.7. Relationship between incident, reﬂected, and refracted rays at interface
The optical pressure force F exerted due to the reﬂection and refraction
at the interface is given by (3.1) considering the momentum change in the

(3.1)
where c is the speed of light in vacuum, T and R are the Fresnel transmission
and reﬂection coeﬃcient, respectively. In the case of circularly polarized light,
R is given as the average of Rs for s-polarization and Rp for p-polarization
leading to (3.2)
R = 1
2(Rs + Rp) = 1

.
(3.2)
Since no absorption is assumed
T = 1 −R.
(3.3)
The total optical pressure acting on a microobject is the vector sum of the
force over the entire cross-section.
Example 3.1. Show that optical pressure is perpendicular to the surface.
Solution. When a ray with a momentum of Mi is incident to the interface be-
tween index of n1 and n2 with an angle of θ1, the momentums of reﬂection Mr
and refraction Mt are expressed as Mr = RMi and Mt = (n2/n1)TMi which
comes from the speed of light c/n and the light energy Mc/n. The transverse
components of the momentum of incidence, reﬂection, and refraction rays are
Mi sin θ1
Mr sin θ1 = RMi sin θ1,
Mt sin θ2 = (n2/n1)TMi sin θ2 = TMi sin θ1.

3.2 Theoretical Analysis
87
As a consequence, the momentum change along the transverse direction before
and after the ray incidence is expressed as
Mi sin θ1 −(Mr sin θ1 + Mt sin θ2) = Mi sin θ1(1 −R −T) = 0.
Example 3.2. Show that the optical pressure force exerted by a ray incidence
at the interface is given by (3.1).
Solution. The vertical components of the momentum of incidence, reﬂection,
and refraction rays are
Mi cos θ1,
Mr cos θ1 = RMi cos θ1,
Mt cos θ2 = (n2/n1)TMi cos θ2.
The momentum change along the vertical direction before and after the ray
incidence is
Mi cos θ1 −(−Mr cos θ1 + Mt cos θ2) = Mi[(1 + R) cos θ1 −(n2/n1)T cos θ2].
Since Mi = n1P/c, the optical pressure F is given as (3.1).
In summary, a light momentum change ∆M per second through reﬂection,
refraction, scattering and absorption causes the optical pressure F. F increases
as the incident angle increases, leading to the lifting of the microobject if laser
light is strongly focused by an objective lens with a high NA.
The principal relationship between F and the power P is
F = Q(n1/c)P,
(3.4)
where Q is a nondimensional eﬃciency parameter (called trapping eﬃciency)
and n1P/c is the incident momentum per second of a ray of the power P in
a medium of the refractive index of n1. The trapping eﬃciency Q depends on
not only the object shape and refractive index but also the optical parameters
of the trapping laser beam. It has the maximum value of 2 when all incident
rays are reﬂected from a totally reﬂecting mirror.
3.2.2 Optical Trapping Eﬃciency
Qualitative optical trapping description is possible for a small transparent
particle whose refractive index is slightly higher than that of the surround-
ing medium. Figure 3.8a shows that the focused laser beam illuminates the
upper part in a microsphere. Consider a typical pair of rays a and b of the
focused beam under the assumption of zero surface reﬂection. When an inci-
dent ray refracts at the top surface, the momentum changes and the upward
optical pressure force (perpendicular to the sphere surface) Fat is exerted.
The optical pressure force Fao is also exerted when ray a is emitted from the
bottom surface. The sum of the both pressure force leads to force Fa owing
to ray a. Similarly, ray b produces the pressure force Fb. The sum of Fa

Fig. 3.8. Qualitative description of optical trap. The microsphere is transparent
and its refractive index is slightly higher than that of the surrounding medium [3.4]
and Fb is shown pointing in the direction of the laser focus f from the center
of the sphere. As a result, the sphere is trapped stably at the point where the
optical pressure force F balances the diﬀerence between the gravity force and
the buoyant force.
We can see, for the arbitrary displacement of the sphere center O from the
focus f, that the vector sum of Fa and Fb gives a net optical pressure force
F directs to the focus as shown in Fig. 3.8b. Since the optical pressure F is
expressed as (3.4), the axial and transverse trapping force analysis results the
simulation of the nondimensional Q of the object, beam convergence angle,
sphere size, shape and relative refractive index with respect to the surrounding
medium, polarization state, and beam proﬁle as parameters.
First, consider a ray of the power P incident to a microsphere at the
angle θ1. Figure 3.9 shows the geometry for this model and trapping force

Fig. 3.9. Optical pressure force on microsphere exerted by single incident ray [3.4]
Example 3.3. Show that the optical pressure forces exerted by a ray of the
power P incident to a dielectric microsphere of the refractive index n2 at the
angle θ1 surrounding the medium of n1 are given by (3.5) and (3.6).
Solution. When the ray strikes the sphere, a fraction of the light PR is re-
ﬂected and the remainder is transmitted into the sphere, as shown in Fig. 3.9.
No absorption is assumed for the sphere. The transmitted fraction produces
an inﬁnite number of internal reﬂections within the sphere and inﬁnite num-
bers of scattered rays escape the sphere. A series of scattered ray powers are
expressed as
PR, PT 2, PRT 2, . . . , PRnT 2, . . .
(n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .)
where T and R are the Fresnel transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients on the
surface at θ1, respectively. The angles of the scattered rays with the incident
ray are expressed as
π + 2θ1, α, α + β, α + 2β, · · · , α + nβ, · · · (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ),
where α = 2(θ1 −θ2) and β = π −2θ2.

Since θ2 = arcsin{(n1/n2) sin θ1}, R is from (3.2), and T is from (3.3), we can
express (3.5) and (3.6) using a ray incident angle θ1.
Figure 3.10 shows the dependence of the trapping eﬃciencies Qs, Qg and
Qt on θ1. The microsphere index of refraction is n2 = 1.5 (glass) and the
surrounding medium index of refraction is n1 = 1.33 (water). The maximum
Qg is obtained at an incident angle of 71.8◦. Therefore, the numerical aperture
of the objective lens corresponding to the angle arcsin(NA/n1) is greater than
1.2, which leads to the tight convergence of the laser beam.
For the calculations presented earlier, a trapping force is obtained by the
vector sum of the contributions of all rays within the convergence angle. This
trapping force varies according to the focus of the laser beam. Axial trapping
eﬃciency is deﬁned when the focus is on the center line of the microsphere
parallel to the optical axis, as shown in Fig. 3.11. Transverse trapping eﬃciency
is deﬁned when the focus is on the center line of the microsphere perpendicular
to the optical axis, as shown in Fig. 3.12.
Figure 3.13 shows the total trapping eﬃciency Qt exerted on a polystyrene
sphere suspended in water by a trap with a uniformly ﬁlled input aperture
of NA = 1.25 which is focused along the optical axis at positions +s and −s
below the center of the sphere. In the ﬁgure, (a) shows the trapping eﬃciency
for the axial trap (Example 3.4) and (b) that for the transverse trap (Prob-
lem 3.4). Both show the maximum when the focus is near the surface of the
sphere and decrease as the focus comes to the center of the sphere. The po-
sitions for the maximum trapping eﬃciency are f = −1.02 and f = 1.05
for the axial trap, and f = ±1.05 for the transverse trap. At these posi-
tions the laser power for trapping become minimum. We can also ﬁnd that

the upward directed beam is more eﬀective in trapping the microsphere than
the downward-directed beam. Table 3.3 shows microsphere materials for the
analysis in this book.
The trapping eﬃciency dependence on the incident angle of a ray means
that trapping eﬃciency is related to the proﬁle of the laser beam. Table 3.4
shows the maximum trapping eﬃciency calculated for input beams with
various mode intensity proﬁles: Gaussian, uniformly ﬁlled, and donut. The
maximum Q increases as the outer part intensity increases. Good trapping is
possible when the outer part of the aperture is ﬁlled by a high intensity to
give a laser beam with a high convergence angle.
Example 3.4. Calculate the axial trapping eﬃciency for a microsphere when
the focus of the uniformly input laser beam is along the optical axis in the
center line of the sphere.
Solution. First, we ﬁnd the incident angle θ1(r, β) of a ray entering the in-
put aperture of the objective lens at the arbitrary point (r, β), as shown in
Fig. 3.11a [3.4]. Since axial trapping eﬃciency is independent on β due to axial
symmetry, we consider r-dependence for the θ1(r, β). The angle φ(r) between
the incidence ray and z-axis is r0 sin θ1(r) = s sin φ(r) where r0 is the radius
of the microsphere (we take r0 = 1 since the results in the ray optics model
are independent on r), s is the distance between the center of the microsphere
and the laser focus. From Fig. 3.11b,
φ(r) = tan−1

Next, the trapping eﬃciencies Qs(r) and Qg(r) are computed by the vector
sum of the contributions of all rays within the convergence angle using (3.5)
and (3.6). Here, the y-component is cancelled out due to the symmetry, only
the z-component is calculated as
Qsz(r) = Qs(r) cos φ(r),
Qgz(r) = Qg(r) sin φ(r).

3.2.3 Eﬀect of Beam Waist
In the ray optics, a laser beam is decomposed into individual rays with appro-
priate intensity, direction and polarization, which propagate in straight lines.
In actual conditions, the focused light beam has a beam waist, which means
that each ray varies its direction near the focus. Therefore, the incident angle
θ1 varies from that of the straight line, leading to the recalculation of the
exact optical pressure force.
We introduce a Gaussian beam proﬁle (3.9) of a beam waist ω0 and the
depth of focus Z0 instead of straight line ray optics as
ω0 =
λ
2NA, Z0 = kω2
0,
(3.9)
where k is the wave number 2π/λ, λ is the wavelength, and NA is the numer-
ical aperture of the objective.
To determine the incident angle θ1(r) of a Gaussian ray passing at r = r in
the aperture of the objective enters at the point (α, β) on the sphere surface
as shown in Fig. 3.14. The coordinates (α, β) are expressed

Then the incident angle θ1(r) is calculated as the angle between the tan-
gent vector a of the Gaussian ray at (α, β) and the direction vector b pointing
to the center of the sphere. After the incident angle θ1(r) is deﬁned, the trap-
ping eﬃciency along the optical axis can be computed. Figure 3.15 show the
result for a polystyrene sphere suspended in water. Considering the beam

by converging ray approximations of straight line (ray optics) and parabolic line

waist, it is seen from the ﬁgure that the axial trapping eﬃciency decreases to
50% that of the straight lines. This is caused by the fact that focused rays are
almost parallel to the optical axis near the focus, as shown in the upper left
sketch in the ﬁgure.
Figure 3.16 shows the transverse trapping eﬃciency along the axis perpen-
dicular to the optical axis. It is seen from the ﬁgure that both straight and
parabolic Gaussian beam rays have almost the same numerical results. This
is based on the fact that the incident angles at the surface of the sphere are
almost the same for both approximations because the laser focus is located
near the surface edge, maximum trapping eﬃciency, on the center line of the
sphere (see the upper left sketch in the ﬁgure).

Next, the trapping eﬃciency due to a circular element of radius β is
given as
Qc = 2πβQz.
Finally, this trapping eﬃciency is integrated over the entire cross-section
of the sphere for all individual rays using the Shimpson formula under the
conditions in Table 3.5.
Figure 3.18 shows the axial trapping eﬃciency dependence on the distance
from the optical ﬁber end for a polystyrene sphere of radii 2.0 and 2.5 µm.
The laser beam proﬁle is Gaussian and the wavelength is 1.3 µm. It is seen
from the ﬁgure that trapping force increases as axial distance increases from
zero to a beam waist of 40 µm, i.e., it increases over the region in which
the ﬁber lens is focusing, and then begins to decrease monotonically as the
beam diverges beyond the focus. Therefore, we can expect that the optimum
dual ﬁber lens spacing will exists at a point where axial trapping eﬃciency is
changing rapidly (see Sect. 3.3.4).

micromachines. The optical ﬁber implementation of such tweezers is simple
and inexpensive. The apparatus that uses a laser diode and an optical ﬁber
is particularly simple since no external optics such as a dichromatic mirror, a
beam splitter, and ﬁlters are required.
Trapping forces can be resolved into two components: the gradient force
Fg, which pulls microspheres in the direction of the strong light intensity,
and te scattering force Fs, which pushes microspheres in the direction of light
propagation. If a microsphere is located on the light propagation axis, the
gradient forces cancel out, thereby resulting in pushing the sphere. Therefore,
two counterpropagating coaxially aligned optical ﬁbers are used to trap the
sphere suspended in water [3.13]. Although the sphere is stabilized axially at
a location where the scattering forces of the two beams balance each other,
the trapping in the transverse direction is weak. The freedom of operation for
the counterpropagating coaxially aligned optical ﬁbers is poor. In this section,
we theoretically analyze an oﬀ-axial microsphere trapping force [3.14] in three
dimensions in order to trap it with a solitary optical ﬁber.
Analysis of Oﬀ-axial Trapping
Trapping eﬃciency for a microsphere on an optical axis can be calculated,
from axial symmetry, as shown in Fig. 3.19a, by integrating the optical pres-
sure force due to an individual ray in two dimensions. On the other hand,
calculation in three dimensions is necessary for the oﬀ-axial trapping eﬃ-
ciency because of axial dissymmetry. Figure 3.19b shows that a ray enters at

As a result, the trapping eﬃciencies Qs(x,z) and Qg(x,z) owing to a ray
hits the intersection (x, y, z) can be obtained using (3.5) and (3.6). The entire
trapping eﬃciency due to the entire surface of the microsphere is given later.

how to integrate Qs(x,z) and Qg(x,z) along the z-axis (b). Calculate the incident

As a result, the total trapping eﬃciency comes from (3.7). Followings are the
numerical results for the oﬀ-axial trapping in three dimensions.
Oﬀ-axial Distance and Microsphere Radius Dependence
In the analysis a circularly polarized laser beam by a laser diode with a 1.3 µm
wavelength, a tapered lensed optical ﬁber with a curvature of 10 µm, and mi-
crospheres 2–10 µm in radius are used under the conditions listed in Table 3.6.
First, transverse trapping eﬃciency on the oﬀ-axial distance (transverse
oﬀset) is analyzed for a polystyrene sphere of 2.5 µm radius located at diﬀerent

axial distances of zero (ﬁber end), beam waist, two-fold beam waist, and
three-fold beam waist. The axial distance of the sphere is measured along the
symmetry axis of the laser beam and the oﬀ-axial distance of the sphere is
measured as a relative distance to the symmetry axis (transverse oﬀset) of the
laser beam. It is seen from the numerical results in Fig. 3.21 that the optical
pressure force towards the beam axis (transverse force) is exerted by oﬀ-axial
trapping and becomes maximum at an axial distance of 3 µm.
Second, transverse trapping eﬃciency at the oﬀ-axial distance is analyzed
for polystyrene spheres of 2–10 µm radius at an axial distance from the beam
waist location. It is seen from Fig. 3.22 that the transverse trapping eﬃciency
increases as the sphere radius increases and the location where the trapping
eﬃciency becomes maximum is far away from the beam axis. When the radius
increases, more power illuminates the sphere; thus the maximum transverse
eﬃciency is realized.
Optical Trapping by Solitary Fiber
In oﬀ-axial trapping, the optical pressure force towards the beam axis (trans-
verse force) Fg is exerted as described earlier. Finally, we realize solitary op-
tical ﬁber trap by balancing the horizontal components of the gradient force
Fg, which always pulls a sphere to the beam axis and the scattering force
Fs, which always pushes a sphere along the beam axis. Figure 3.23 shows the
concept of the horizontal component balanced between the optical pressures
Fs and Fg owing to the oblique incident θ for an optical ﬁber [3.15].

Following are the analyses for the incident angle of θ that satisﬁes Fgz =
Fsz for polystyrene radii ranging from 2 to 10 µm. Figure 3.24 shows the ﬁber
incident angle for diﬀerent sphere radii at the maximum gradient force on
oﬀ-axial position. It is seen from the ﬁgure that as axial distance increases
the ﬁber incident angle illuminating the sphere ﬁrst decreases, then increases
a little and becomes constant (about 40◦) at the axial distance of 10 µm.
Figure 3.25 also shows the numerical results, showing that incident angle
decreases at radius intervals of 0–3 µm; after that it remains almost constant
at 35◦. From the results stated earlier, we may trap a microsphere two di-
mensionally by a solitary ﬁber illuminating at an angle of about 40◦. By the
way, the experimental results for glass and polystyrene microspheres of 5 µm
diameter show that the minimum trapping power linearly increases with stage
velocity (Fig. 3.37).

3.3 Experimental Measurement and Comparison
of Experimental and Theoretical Predictions
The use of optical tweezers is seen as a method of manipulating [3.16],
aligning [3.17], fabricating and rotating [3.8] microobjects mainly in aqueous
solutions. The optical trapping characteristics of spherical particles for these
types of application were analyzed theoretically in Sec. 3.2 and are analyzed
experimentally in this section. We not only describe the results of the exper-
iments required to determine the characteristics of the optical trap but also
compare the results with that of theoretical ones.

Fig. 3.26. Experimental setup for trapping and manipulating microobjects us-
ing upward-directed and downward-directed YAG laser beams with wavelength of
1.06 µm
having a TEM00 mode structure is shown in Fig. 3.26. The laser beam di-
ameter is increased from 0.7 to 8.2 mm by a beam expander to ﬁll the entire
aperture of the objective uniformly. A quarter-wave plate is placed to generate
a circularly polarized beam. The intensity of the laser beam is varied using
a ND ﬁlter. The beam is divided by a beam splitter to enter two objective
lenses for focusing the downward-directed and upward-directed laser beams.
A dichroic mirror is used to separate the transmitted image from the trapping
beam. The total transmittance eﬃciency from YAG laser to the objective is
about 35%. The transmittance eﬃciency of the immersion oil objective lens
(NA = 1.25) is 21% at a wavelength of 1.06 µm.
Figure 3.27 shows photographs of the experimental setup. Microobjects are
suspended in an aqueous medium in a chamber. The chamber is made similar
to a hole of a spacer (50–150 µm in depth) inserted between a coverslip (150 µm
in depth) and a glass slide. The particle is trapped so as to be pulled to the
focus of a strongly converging laser beam transmitted through the coverslip.
When the objective lens moves, the particle follows the objective motion.
The trapping behavior of the microobjects is monitored using a CCD camera.
We have measured the minimum laser power for both axially trapped and
transversely trapped particles by balancing the gravitational force and the
viscous drag force, respectively.
The particles have also been manipulated successfully using the upward-
directed and downward-directed laser beams. Two beams do not interfere each
other, which leads to the appropriate manipulation of microobjects such as in
the assembly of particles in the fabrication of a 3-D microobject.

To measure the minimum axial trapping power P ax
min, ﬁrst, polystyrene/glass
spheres are dispersed in water and trapped by a circularly polarized laser beam
converged with a 1.25-NA objective lens. Second, the power of the trapping

Dependence of minimum axial trapping power on diameter for
polystyrene spheres (a), and glass spheres (b)
beam decreased until the microsphere is observed to fall out of the trap.
This P ax
min is taken to be the diﬀerence between the gravitational and buoyant
forces. The spheres used for experiments are polystyrene (ρ = 1.06 g cm−3,
n = 1.60) of 3.23, 5.85, 7.73, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 µm in diameter and glass
(ρ = 2.54 g cm−3, n = 1.51) of 1.0, 2.5, 3.1, 5.1 and 5.8 µm in diameter.
Figure 3.28 shows the dependence of the measured P ax
min on sphere diam-
eter at T = 10 µm for the polystyrene (light) spheres (a), and glass (heavy)
spheres (b), where T is the distance of the laser focus from the coverslip.
P ax
min with an upward-directed (lower) laser beam is less than that with the
downward-directed (upper) laser beam because the scattering force is added
to the gradient force to trap the particle with an upward-directed beam. The
discrepancy between the predicted and the measured forces is found to be
smaller for a heavy particle (glass) than that for a light particle (polystyrene).
This may be because the glass has smaller eﬀects in both Brownian motion
and electrostatic force than polystyrene.
The theoretical axial trapping power P ax
pre is shown by the solid line (up-
ward directed) and the broken line (downward directed) from (3.21) [3.11]

that considers gravity, buoyancy and Brownian movement (theoretical trap-
ping power is calculated using the expression P ax
pre = F ax
prec/n1Qmax).
F ax
pre = π
6 (ρs −ρm) d3g + 2kT/d,
(3.21)
where ρs and ρm are the densities of the sample spheres and suspending
medium, respectively; d is the diameter of the spheres, g is the gravitational
acceleration, and kT is the thermal energy.
Results of comparison of traps between experimental and theoretical meth-
ods are summarized in Table 3.7 as the ratio of P ax
min to P ax
pre. The measured
P ax
min for glass beads matches the theoretical P ax
pre at large diameters (only
about 1.5 times diﬀerence for the diameter of 5.8 µm) because the ray op-
tics model is appropriate and the Brownian eﬀect is relatively small for large
diameters. In parentheses, the experimental value with the upward-directed
beam for the 5.8 µm diameter becomes large because the wall force (between
the bead and the cover slip) strongly pulls the bead downward at a small
distance of about 4.2(= 10 −5.8) µm.
A comparison is also given for the axial trapping power in both straight ray
and parabolic ray approximations. Figure 3.29 shows the minimum axial trap-
ping power for polystyrene microspheres comparing the experimental measure-
ments to the predicted results for a straight ray model (broken line) and a
parabolic ray model (solid line). It is seen from the ﬁgure that the minimum
axial trapping power largely increases for the parabolic ray model and is close
to the experimental results. This is because the actual focused trapping laser
beam has a beam waist (parabolic ray model) and the individual ray enters
almost vertically to the sphere surface leading to a reduced trapping eﬃciency.
3.3.3 Transverse Trapping Power
Next, the transverse trapping power P trans
min
was measured as the minimum
power for trapping a particle moving at the constant velocity v in water, as

on sphere velocity for d =

increases as bead velocity

theoretical ones.
Figure 3.32 shows the dependence of P trans
min
on sphere size (diameter) for
polystyrene particles with a downward-directed beam. P trans
min
substantially
increases as d increases due to the Stokes drag force increase. The discrepancies
between the theory and experiment for the trapping forces at d > 30 µm is due
to the fact that the trapping position moves to upward from the transverse
center line in the sphere, and that Q becomes smaller, since the gravitational
force increases for such large spheres [3.18] (Q3.7).
3.3.4 Optical Fiber Trapping
To realize a simple and inexpensive implementation of an optical trap, 3-D
trapping using the counterpropagating light beams from two optical ﬁbers
and 2-D trapping using a solitary ﬁber were demonstrated. Figure 3.33 shows

photographs of the setup around ﬁber ends (a), and the dual tapered ﬁber
trap (b). The trap equilibrium position of a 5-µm-diameter glass bead varies
depending on the laser power ratio between the dual ﬁbers. Laser diodes
of 1.3 µm wavelength and cleaved/tapered (hemispherically machined lensed
end) optical ﬁbers are used for the experiment (Tables 3.5, Example 3.6).
Figure 3.34 shows the relationship between the trap equilibrium position
and the output power from the left side ﬁber ranging from 0 to 40 mW when
the output power from right-side ﬁber is 15 mW for diﬀerent ﬁber lens spac-
ings, which leads to enables the trapping of the particle at any positions in
the dual ﬁber spacing by changing power ratio. The performance of a lensed
ﬁber trap (b) is less sensitive in position than that of a cleaved ﬁber trap (a)
due to its focus depth characteristics.
Figure 3.35 shows that the particle moves to the right continuously as the
left power increases for small spacing of the ﬁber lens, but jumps for large spac-
ing of the ﬁber lens. When the spacing becomes large, axial trapping becomes

unstable. Anyway, adjusting the relative powers of the optical ﬁbers allow us
to trap and position a bead over axial distances using the counterpropagating
coaxially aligned optical ﬁbers.
Figure 3.36 shows the trapping performance of a solitary ﬁber. The ﬁber,
with an illuminating angle of 40◦, traps a microsphere of 10 µm diameter. The
minimum trapping power is linearly proportional to the velocity of the stage
as shown in Fig. 3.37. The power is smaller for polystyrene than that for glass
because the polystyrene refractive index (trapping eﬃciency) is larger and its
density (friction force at the surface due to the 2-D trapping) is smaller than
that of the glass.
In summary, we measured the optical-trapping force on polystyrene and
glass microspheres of diﬀerent diameters in two orthogonal directions with
upward-directed and downward-directed laser beams and optical ﬁbers. Fol-
lowing are our experimental results:
1. We conﬁrmed that the upward-directed beam has a higher trapping
eﬃciency than the downward beam for both polystyrene and glass

Minimum trapping power (mW)
Fig. 3.37. Relationship between minimum trapping power obtained using solitary
optical ﬁber and stage velocity for microsheres of 10 micrometer in diameter
microspheres. This is because the trapping force is equivalent to Fg −Fs
for downward illumination, but to Fg + Fs for upward illumination. The-
oretically, the minimum trapping power ratios between the upward- and
downward-directed beams are 1.8 for polystyrene sphere and 1.6 for glass
sphere.
2. The experimental minimum trapping powers are in fairly good agreement
with the theoretical ones for axial trapping, but not in good agreement for
transverse trapping. This is because the trapping position for transverse
trapping changes due to the large gravitational force, particularly for high-
density and/or large particles.
3. The minimum axial trapping power increases as the trapping position
increases from the chamber surface. This is because the spherical aberra-
tion due to the refractive index diﬀerence between the immersion oil of the
objective and the aqueous medium in which a microsphere is suspended.
4. Brownian motion is active for microspheres less than about 1 µm in diam-
eter, which increases trapping power.
5. Optical ﬁber trapping is expected to improve both the operation and
implementation.
Example 3.6. Show that the force due to Brownian motion of a microsphere
suspended in water is equivalent to F = 2kT/d where k is the Boltzman con-
stant, T is the absolute temperature and d is the diameter of a microsphere.
Solution. Microspheres smaller than about 1 µm in diameter seem to fall out
of the optical trap when laser power is reduced below a certain level. This
is due to the thermal energy driving the particle in the weakest direction of
the optical trap, i.e., parallel to the beam axis. To express the thermal eﬀect
in force units we assume that the harmonic trap potential Kz2/2 (K is the

112
3 Optical Tweezers
optical spring constant) equals the thermal energy kT/2 (Brownian motion
energy) [3.11], Therefore, K = kT/z2.
At the moment of escape, z = d/2 because the maximum trapping eﬃ-
ciency is close to the surface of the sphere. In this case, the equivalent force
of the Brownian motion is
F = Kz = kT
z2 z = 2kT
d .
3.4 Applications of Optical Tweezers
Ashkin et al. [3.19] demonstrated the optical trapping of a transparent mi-
crosphere by a strongly focused laser beam. A single-beam gradient-force
optical trapping technique has been proved to be useful in the study of
biological processes because of its noninvasive nature [3.20]. Recently, op-
tical tweezers have been applied in various scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds
listed in Table 3.8. Inexpensive ﬁber manipulation is expected for easy
implementation.
Not only a solid laser but also an LD can be used as a light source for
trapping. The optical pressure force is very weak, nearly pN/mW, but can
manipulate particles on the micrometer scale. Since the gravitational force in-
creases proportional to the third power of the particle radius and the Brownian
eﬀect increases inversely proportional to the radius, there exists an adequate
objective size in trapping. It corresponds to several micrometers, facilitating
the manipulation of living cells in its early developing stage. 3-D trapping is
possible for various particles ranging from 20 nm to tens of micrometers in-
cluding biological, dielectric and polymer particles which are transparent for
the laser beam, as shown in Fig. 3.38.
Recently, materials have been widening for further applications. For ex-
ample, the 3-D trapping of metallic objects is possible due to a gradient force
of the light intensity in the Rayleigh regime where the size is much less than
the wavelength, and also due to the diﬀractive eﬀect of the light at the sur-
face of the object with a size of several wavelengths [3.21]. Gahagam et al. of
Wochester Polytechnic Institute demonstrated the 3-D trapping of low-index
particles in the size range of 2–50 µm using a donut-shaped intensity pro-
ﬁle beam [3.22]. Higurashi et al. of NTT trapped ringlike (hollow), low-index
microobjects in a high-index liquid using upward bottom-surface radiation
pressure [3.17]. The ringlike microobject was made of ﬂuorinated polyimide,
with a refractive index of 1.53 and a surrounding liquid refractive index of
1.61. Following are the actual applications of the optical tweezers classiﬁed in
the ﬁeld of basic research and industry.

manipulation of bacteria and the measurement of the swimming speed of
mitochondria are shown in Fig. 3.39. Furthermore, living cell fusion [3.20] by
violet light exposure in the contact area of two cells trapped independently is
shown in Fig. 3.40.
Another example is the compliance measurement of bacterial ﬂagella. The
torque generated by the ﬂagella motor of a bacterium tethered to a glass
surface by a ﬂagella ﬁlament was measured by balancing that generated by
the optical pressure force. The balance was realized by calibrating optical
power [3.24].
The direct observation of kinesin stepping was performed by optical
trapping interferometry with a special and temporal sensitivity for resolving
movement on the molecular scale, as shown in Fig. 3.41 [3.25]. Silica spheres
carrying single molecules of the motor protein kinesin were deposited on mi-
crotubules using optical tweezers and their motion was analyzed to determine
whether kinesin moves in 8 nm steps.

actin ﬁlament with beads attached to both ends was suspended in a solution
by YAG laser trapping. The ﬂuorescence was excited by the evanescent wave
generated by the total reﬂection of the green laser shown in the ﬁgure. The
local illumination by the evanescent light greatly reduced the background

Displacement and force due to actin–myosin interactions were determined
by measuring bead displacement with nanometer accuracy by a quadrant
photodiode. Individual ATPase reactions were monitored by an SIT camera as
changes in ﬂuorescence intensity due to association–(hydrolysis)–dissociation
events of a ﬂuorescent ATP (analog labeled with Cy3-ATP) with the myosin
head. As a result, it was found that the myosin head produces several hun-
dred of milliseconds after a bound nucleotide is released. This suggests that
myosin has hysteresis or memory state, and stores chemical energy from ATP
hydrolysis [3.26].

Optical tweezers are used in the ﬁeld of chemistry. Figure 3.43 shows a mi-

lasers (λ = 1, 064 nm) trap and close particles in contact with each other.
Q-switched YAG laser (λ = 350 nm) stimulates the photochemical reaction
between such particles. Such a chemical reaction was studied by a picosecond
time-resolved laser spectroscopy. They expect that such approaches will make
it possible to study the chemical and physical properties of a single ﬁne parti-
cle as a function of its size, shape, surface morphology and to promote highly
selective/eﬃcient material conversion [3.27].
Optics
Micrometer-sized spherical particles can act as optical cavities in air or liquid
[3.28]. Resonant ﬁeld is formed inside the surface of particles doped with laser
dye such that the light propagates in a circumferential manner due to the
total internal deﬂection at the interface [3.29]. The optical characteristics of
the microsphere laser oscillation, such as polarization of resonant modes and
interaction between close particles, were studied. Photon tunneling from the
lasing microsphere to an object was demonstrated as a marked change of
an emission spectrum depending on microsphere-to-object distance. Lasing
microspheres have the advantage of high sensitivity due to the intracavity
enhancement of tunneling loss, i.e., a probe of a scanning near-ﬁeld optical
microscopy (SNOM) [3.30]. In addition, an optically trapped gold particle
was demonstrated to be a useful near-ﬁeld probe for the study of the surface
characteristics beyond the diﬀraction limit resolution [3.31,3.32].

Micromechanics
Laser scanning manipulation was applied to measure the drag force [3.33]
acting on a glass bead moving in mineral oil between two glass plates. The
rotation rate of a small particle induced by optical pressure was measured by
the cycle of the scattered light from optically trapped particles [3.34].
3.4.2 Industry
Particle Transport
The spatial patterning and directional transport of plural particles in wa-
ter were shown to be possible by single-beam laser trapping. For radioactive
substance or nucleus materials, the optical trapping of metallic oxide parti-
cles with various optical constants were performed to conﬁne, position and
transport without physical contact in water by Omori et al. 3-D trapping was
possible for a ThO2 particle but only 2-D trapping was observed for a UO2
particle in water using an He–Ne laser light at 633 nm. This is because a UO2
particle has a relatively large refractive index and a large extinction coeﬃcient
in the visible region [3.35].
Figure 3.44 shows the relationship between optical constant (refractive
index n and extinction coeﬃcient k) and the maximum trapping eﬃciency
Qmax for microspheres with a wavelength of 633 nm. The objective’s NA is
1.3 and the microsphere diameters are 2µm (a) and 10 µm (b). In this calcu-
lation, absorption was considered, therefore decreasing Qmax with increasing
the diameter. It is also seen from the ﬁgure that 3-D trapping was possible
for the metallic oxide having a refractive index less than 2.4 by an He–Ne
laser light (Qmax < 0). They also demonstrated that laser trapping was also
possible in air [3.36].

Fabrication of 3-D Microstructures
The simultaneous manipulation and microfabrication of spatially arranged ﬁne
particles are attained using optical tweezers by introducing pulsed violet laser
illumination [3.9]. Figure 3.45 shows a microassembly system. The trapping
and ablation (adhesion) laser sources used are a 515-nm CW Ar+ laser and a
355-nm pulsed YAG laser, respectively.
Such systems mentioned earlier were limited to a small number of objects
trapped in a single plane. Recently, components can be designed to split a laser
beam into many separate beams. Holographic optical tweezers can trap objects
in diﬀerent focal planes allowing many objects to be simultaneously trapped
[3.37]. Crystal-like structures over a scale of tens micrometers were constructed
using holographic optical tweezers [3.38]. Eight 2-µm-diameter silica spheres
were trapped through the multiple trapping function of the hologram at the
corner of a cube [3.39]. The real-time calculation of the required holographic
pattern allows us to rotate the structure about an arbitrary axis.
Patterning Surfaces with Nanoparticles
The 2-D arrangement of colloids on a substrate is of interest for photonics,
electronics, magnetic, and sensor applications.Optical tweezers are used to

bring particles from a reservoir and pattern nanoparticles on the substrate.
Fixing was carried out using opposite charges [3.40] or local photopolymer-
ization [3.41] around the nanoparticle assembly.
Optical Rotor
Optical pressure can also rotate dissymmetrical microobjects. Many types
of optical rotor have been proposed for future applications, which will be
described in Chap. 4.

Optical Rotor
Optical tweezers have been successfully utilized in various scientiﬁc and en-
gineering ﬁelds such as biology, microchemistry, physics, optics and micro-
mechanics. Their ability to rotate microobjects remotely without the use of
bearings presents important opportunities in optical microelectromechanical
systems (optical MEMS) and biotechnology. This chapter describes the prin-
ciple, design, fabrication, and evaluation of an optical rotor to increase the
mixing performance of microliquids to enable future ﬂuidic applications. The
optical rotor will be used as a mixer in micrototal analysis systems (µ-TAS).
4.1 Background
In space, small particles are blown away rotationally by the radiation pres-
sure of the sun, the so-called windmill eﬀect. In micromechanics the following
methods are known for rotating a microobject using a single laser beam: one
in which a circularly polarized laser beam is used [4.1] and another in which
the rotating nonuniform intensity proﬁle of a higher-order-mode laser beam is
used [4.2]. However, the rotation speeds of both methods are very slow, about
6.7 × 10−1 −6.7 × 10−2 rpm [4.1] and 6 rpm [4.2].
Trapping and manipulation of micrometer-sized particles were demon-
strated ﬁrstly by Ashkin using a laser beam through a microscope objec-
tive [3.2]. Presently, optical tweezers have been successfully applied in various
ﬁelds. The optical pressure can also be used to rotate the dissymmetrical mi-
croobjects shown in Fig. 4.1, which are a polystyrene particle (refractive index
n = 1.6, density ρ = 1.07 g cm−3), a broken glass (n = 1.5, ρ = 2.2 g cm−3), a
glass rod having concave end on the top and elongated cylindrical body, a bro-
ken ZnO (n = 2.0, ρ = 5.67 g cm−3), a broken Si (n = 3.5, ρ = 2.33 g cm−3),
and a broken GaP (n = 2.12, ρ = 4.13 g cm−3) for example. However, we
cannot control the rotational direction for arbitrarily shaped broken micro-
objects.

Higurashi et al. reported in 1994 that they could experimentally cause a
directional high-speed rotation, for example, 22 rpm of artiﬁcial rotors in water
[4.3]. Yamamoto et al. measured the rotation rate of anisotropically shaped
particles using the temporal variation of light scattered from the rotation
particle [4.4]. Gauthier showed an example of a numerical computation of the
torque exerted on a rotor under restricted conditions [4.5].
Figure 4.2 shows a rotor with shape dissymmetry on its side [4.3]. The
rotor was made by reactive ion-beam etching of a 10-µm-thick silicon dioxide
(SiO2) layer. When incident laser light refracts at the top surface of the rotor,
the momentum of the light changes and an upward optical pressure force
for trapping is exerted as shown in Fig 4.3a. Optical pressure force is also
exerted when the light emits from the side surfaces. Fig. 4.3b shows the optical
pressure exerted on side surfaces I and II but not on side surface III. This is

Fig. 4.3. Optical pressure force exerted on the light-incident upper surface lifts the
rotor (a), and that exerted on the light-emission side surfaces rotates it (b)
because surface III is parallel to the radial direction and does not refract the
laser beam. The optical pressure on side surface II does not contribute to
the optical torque because its direction is radial. The optical pressure on side
surface I, however, rotates the microobject counterclockwise, and we can see
that the direction of rotation can be controlled by appropriately designing
the dissymmetric geometry. Nevertheless, this type of optical rotor has the
following drawbacks.
1. a strongly focused laser beam is required
2. only a fraction of the incident light is eﬀective for rotation
3. the viscous drag force is very large due to the complicated side shape.
To solve these problems, Ukita et al. extended their work and invented
a new rotor remotely driven by not only a focused laser beam but also an
unfocused (parallel) laser beam [4.6]. Fig. 4.4 shows the designed optical rotor
that has a sloped top, a cylindrical body and a ﬂat plane on the bottom. This
rotor has shape dissymmetry on the top, which generates an optical trapping
force and optical torque at the same time. The optical force F, perpendicular
to the rotor slope, is torsionally exerted along the beam axis. F is separated
into two components, scattering force Fs, and gradient force Fg. The gradient
force Fg is further separated into the torque force Ft, and radial force Fr. On
the lower surface, only the scattering force is exerted, and no z-axis torque is
exerted because the surface is perpendicular to the optical axis. On the side
surface, optical pressure does not contribute to the z-axis torque because of
its radial direction.
The total z-axis torque and the rotation speed have been evaluated using
the ray-tracing method taking into consideration the beam waist with various
optical parameters such as the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens and the
laser beam proﬁle, as well as rotor shape parameters including oblique angle,
height and diameter. As a result, the cylindrical rotor driven by forces exerted
on its top surface is expected to rotate much faster than the previous rotors
[4.3] driven by forces exerted on their side surfaces. This is because all incident
light that hits the upper surface generates torque and also because the viscous
drag force is small due to the cylindrical structure.

Applications include optical motors for micromachines and optical mix-

signiﬁcant eﬀect on developments in optical MEMS and micromechanical pho-
tonic systems; recently, a micromotor [4.7], a microgear [4.8], a micromachine
element [4.9], and a micromachine with complicated shape [4.10] have been
presented.
4.2 Theoretical Analysis I – Optical Torque
Two kinds of optical rotors are presented: a rotational but not bilaterally
symmetrically structured rotor to which optical torque is applied on its side
surfaces and a cylindrical optical rotor which has slopes for rotation on its
top. Their rotation mechanisms have been clariﬁed both experimentally and
theoretically. The optical rotor is expected to solve the problems of an MEMS
motor, i.e., short lifetime due to friction and requirement of electrical wires
for the power supply.
4.2.1 Optical Rotor Having a Dissymmetrical Shape (Shuttlecock)
on its Side
The optical rotation principle of a shuttlecock optical rotor that has no bi-
lateral symmetry in the horizontal cross-section is shown in Fig. 4.3. In order
to simulate the optical torque, the laser beam was divided into 100 × 100
elements on the objective lens aperture, as shown in Fig. 4.5. We considered

Figure 4.6a shows the optical torque dependence on the focal point where
the refractive indexes are n1 = 1.33 and n2 = 1.6. The diameter is d = 20 µm,
and the thickness is t = 10 µm, and the wing width is w = 3.3 µm. The optical
torque reaches a maximum when the focal point is 4 µm above the top surface.
Fig. 4.6b shows the simulated results at the focal point located 5 µm above the
upper surface of the rotor under the same conditions as above. The optical
torque increases as the NA increases and reaches a maximum at NA = 1.2
because the large divergent angle increases the amount of light emitted from
the side surface, as shown in Fig. 4.3a, but it decreases due to the increase in
reﬂectivity at the top surface when NA becomes greater than 1.2. Table 4.1

4.2.2 Optical Rotor with Slopes on the Light-Incident Surface
The characteristics of the optical trapping force and optical torque for a cylin-
drical optical rotor with slopes on the light-incident surface are analyzed using
a ray optics model for both parallel and focused laser beam illuminations. The
rotor is expected to be aligned with the light beam propagation axis. Since
the total illuminated light beam contributes to the rotation and the cylindri-
cal shape is eﬀective in decreasing the viscous drag force, this new rotor is
expected to rotate much faster than the conventional one.
First, light-driven cylindrical rotors with various slope angles and height-
to-radius ratios are analyzed. Figure 4.4 shows that the optical pressure force
F perpendicular to the surface, at an arbitrary point on the top surface is
torsionally directed along the beam axis. Force F is decomposed into two
components: scattering force Fs pointing in the direction of the beam axis
and gradient force Fg pointing in the direction perpendicular to the beam
axis. Gradient force Fg (not shown) is decomposed further into torque force
Ft and radial force Fr. On the lower surface, only scattering force Fb is exerted,
and no z-axis torque exists because the surface is perpendicular to the optical
axis.
Parallel Beam Illumination
We assume that a circularly polarized Gaussian Nd:YAG laser beam (wave-
length λ = 1.064 µm, power P = 100 mW) illuminates the rotor (refractive
index n2 = 1.5, density ρ = 2.2 g cm−3, diameter 2r = 3 µm and height
h = 10 µm) in water (n1 = 1.33). When vertically illuminated on the top
surface by a parallel beam, the incident angle a1 is equal to a (the slope angle
of the rotor) and the optical pressure F at arbitrary point A is given by (4.2).
Quantities R and T are derived from the Fresnel reﬂection and transmission
coeﬃcients using (3.2) and (3.3). Scattering force Fs and torque force Ft at
point A are given by
Fs = F cos(a)
(4.5)
Ft = Fg sin(θ) = F sin(a) sin(θ)
(4.6)
Therefore, torque Tq at point A is
Tq = rFt = Qtorque(n1P/c),
(4.7)
where Qt is the torque eﬃciency in unit of m.
When vertically illuminated by a parallel beam, all the refracted light is
reﬂected by the side surface, which leads to the incident angle to the bottom
surface being (a1 −a2). Therefore, optical pressure Fb at the bottom surface
is given by
Fb = {(n2/n1)(1 + R′) cos(a −a2) −T ′ cos(a3)}(n2P ′/c),
(4.8)

128
4 Optical Rotor
where a3 is the refraction angle for the incident angle of (a −a2), P ′ is the
incident light power at the bottom, R′ is the reﬂectivity and T ′ is the trans-
mittance at the bottom. The total trapping force is given as the total sum
Ftrap =
 
(Fs + Fb) dS,
(4.9)
and total torque Mopt acting on the rotor is given as the sum
Mopt = n1
c P
 
QtorquedS.
(4.10)
Figure 4.7 shows the dependence of trapping force Ftrap on slope angle
a. We have deﬁned the positive axial trapping force to be in the +z direc-
tion. The curves show Ftrap on the top (upper), bottom (lower), and both
surfaces (total). Since all the rays refracted at the top surface are reﬂected
from the side surface, scattering force Fb on the ﬂat bottom is always greater
than scattering force Fs on the top. Thus the net trapping force (Fb −Fs),
always positive, pushes the rotor away, which leads to two-dimensional (2-D)
trapping.
Figure 4.8 shows the dependence of the rotation rate on the slope angle.
Assuming that the rotor is cylindrical, we can approximate the rotation rate
by Mopt = Mdrag(= 4πµr2hω), where Mopt is the optical torque of (4.10), µ
is the medium viscosity (µ = 1 mPa s), r is the radius, h is the height of the
rotor and ω is the angular velocity.
Focused Beam Illumination
A ray tracing method considering the beam waist is employed to analyze the
optical forces exerted by a focused laser beam. Figure 4.9 shows ray tracing for
the rotor illuminated with a focused beam. An incident ray repeats reﬂection

computation, the beam was divided into 100 × 100 area segments on the

Figure 4.11 shows examples of trapping eﬃciency Q and Fig. 4.12 shows
torque eﬃciency Qtorque vs beam waist position for the slope angles of 20◦
and 45◦with numerical aperture NA as a parameter. A negative value of Q
is observed in Fig. 4.11. It indicates that the trapping force pulls the rotor
toward the focused point of the incident beam, which leads to 3-D trapping.
Torque eﬃciency Qtorque increases as NA decreases. Fast rotation is possible
when NA decreases to produce a laser beam with a large radius on the top
surface.

Figure 4.14 shows the relationship between the rotation rate and beam
power for two NAs, assuming Mopt = Mdrag(= 4πµr2hω). The rotation rate
is linearly proportional to the beam power and it increases as NA decreases.
A rotation rate as high as 700 rpm is predicted using a 100 mW laser beam
with a focused beam illumination of NA = 0.8. A cylindrical optical rotor is
expected to rotate at a high speed due to its highly eﬃcient optical torque
generation and small viscous drag force under parallel beam illumination.

4.2 Theoretical Analysis I – Optical Torque

Eﬀect of Light Beam Proﬁles
The trapping force and rotation rate are calculated for various beam intensity
proﬁles of the form
TEM00(Gaussian) mode : I(r) = I0 exp(−2r2/w2
0),
(4.16)
uniformly ﬁlled aperture mode : I(r) = I0,
(4.17)
TEM01(donut) mode : I(r) = I0(r/w0)2 exp(−2r2/w2
0).
(4.18)
The fractions of the total beam power that enters the lens aperture are 87%
(a), 100% (b), and 59% (c). Below, all the light powers are normalized after
the lens aperture.
Example 4.1. Analyze the relationship between the rotation rate and the slope
angle with illuminated by beams with Gaussian (a), uniformly ﬁlled (b), and
donut (c) intensity proﬁles.
Solution. Figure 4.15 shows the numerical results for the rotor of d =
3 µm, h = 10 µm, and n2 = 1.53 in water of µ = 1 mPa s at the laser power of
P = 100 mW. Since the torque at an arbitrary point is deﬁned as the product
of force Ft and distance r from the rotation axis, a high rotation rate (torque
eﬃciency) can be obtained with beam proﬁle (c) which has high intensity at
the outer part of the aperture. Optical torque increases in linear proportion
to the radius of the rotor, and the drag force increases as twice the radius,
therefore, rotation rate decreases inversely proportional to the radius. Rota-
tion rate increases as the slope angle a increases and reaches a maximum at
a = 75◦. As a result, a laser beam with a strong proﬁle at the outer part and
a rotor with small radius are eﬀective for increasing the rotation rate.

beam waist position zf for the rotor illuminated by converging laser beams of

Solution. Figure 4.16 shows the relationship between Qtorque and zf for the
diﬀerent beam proﬁles. Good trapping and fast rotation are possible when
the outer part of the input aperture is ﬁlled by a high intensity beam. In
addition, the dependence of the rotation rate on the incident power for two
NAs is shown in Fig. 4.17. The rotation rate increases as the intensity of the
outer part becomes high. We can improve the rotation rate by adjusting the
incident beam proﬁles.
In summary, it is conﬁrmed that a high rotation rate can be obtained
under the following conditions:
1. high NA of the objective lens
2. large slope angle of the microobject
3. high refractive index of the microobject (Problem 4.3)
4. large number of slopes on the microobject (Problem 4.4)
5. beam proﬁle of high intensity at the outer part of the aperture.

4.2.3 Enhanced Shuttlecock Rotors with Slopes
In order to obtain high torque eﬃciency, a shuttlecock optical rotor with
slopes, as shown in Fig. 4.18, is proposed. The enhanced rotor has the ability
to generate optical torque upon parallel beam illumination at not only the
side of the wing but also on the wing slope.
In order to simulate the optical torque, we considered a ray incidence on
the slope. The ray refracts at the slope, exerting optical pressure F (generates
torque in normal direction), and reﬂects back side surface III, exerting F ′
(generates torque in the reverse direction) as shown in Fig. 4.19. The optical
pressure exerted at bottom surface II and at side surface I are very low owing
to low reﬂectivities.
Figure 4.20 shows the simulated results for the enhanced shuttlecock ro-
tor for parallel beam illumination with the refractive index of n2 = 1.6. The
diameter is d = 20 µm, and the thickness is t = 10 µm, and the wing width is
w = 3.3 µm. The simulation conditions are listed in Table 4.2 (optical condi-
tions are the same as listed in Table 4.1). Fig. 4.20 shows that the total optical

torque increases as the slope angle increases and reaches a maximum at 45◦
because the large divergent angle increases the reverse torque at back side
surface III.
Figure 4.21a shows that the total optical torque increases as the wing width
increases and Fig. 4.20b shows that total optical torque decreases as the thick-
ness increases owing to the increase of reverse torque, which indicates that the
optimum thickness equals that of the slope.
4.3 Theoretical Analysis II – Fluid Dynamics
Microﬂow around the rotor is analyzed through the process shown in Fig. 4.22.
The simulation was performed in a 3-D geometry with a commercial compu-
tational ﬂuid dynamics tool (CFX-4, AEA Corp.) [4.11].
First, the rotor shape is input and the cube grid is formed. The initial
conditions of the medium, water at 283 K, density, and viscosity are deﬁned.
The control volume is a cube, in which each domain has a set of discretized
equations that are formulated by evaluating and integrating the ﬂuxes across

The solver performs a number of iterations to minimize the overall change

shearing stress S are obtained. On the other hand, in the medium, velocity
U and streamlines are obtained.
Lastly, from the above computational results, the drag force is calculated
as the sum of the torque components of both the pressure (normal component)
and the shearing stress (tangential component) on all surfaces of the rotor as
Mdrag =
 
(Pt + St)r2dr dθ,
(4.21)
where Pt is the torque component of pressure P, St is that of the shearing
stress and r is the radius at that point.
4.3.1 Optical Rotor Having a Dissymmetrical Shape on its Side
Velocity Vectors and Streamlines
To evaluate the performance of the optical rotor in water, the streamlines
around the rotor and the viscous drag force acting on the surface of the rotor
were investigated using a ﬂuid ﬂow solver. The ﬂuid is water (n1 = 1.33)
at 283 K (incompressible viscous ﬂow, density ρ = 1.0 g cm−3, viscosity
µ = 1.0 mPa s). The corresponding Reynolds number (Re = rωd2/4π) nearly
equals 10−4.
Velocity vectors U = (u, v, w) in the proximity of the rotor at the speed of
200 rpm were analyzed, and the results are shown in Fig. 4.23. We found that
the velocity vector has a component in the z direction even with horizontal
rotation. Contour lines around the mixer for the 1-µm s−1 pitch horizontal
component (a), and for the 0.1-µm s−1 pitch vertical component (b) are shown
in Fig. 4.24. The ﬂow goes not only outward but also up and down, which leads
to circulation.

u2 + v2 (a), and for vertical component w (b). Here,
ﬂux amount is deﬁned as the sum of absolute U in the observation plane
of 54 µm × 40 µm. From the ﬁgures, we can see that horizontal component
√
u2 + v2 decreases exponentially as the depth increases and that vertical
component w reaches a maximum near the upper and lower surfaces of the
rotor. From these theoretical analyses, we conclude that the velocity increases
near the rotor and that the ﬂow goes outward and up and down, which pro-
motes ﬂuid mixing.
Figure 4.26 shows the eﬀect of the enhanced shuttlecock rotor with slopes
(angle of 45◦) on the ﬂux amount. We ﬁnd that the ﬂux amount vertical with
slopes becomes much larger than that without slopes.

stress S(= dU/dx) (b), exerted on the surfaces of the rotor at the rotation
rate of 500 rpm are analyzed and shown in Fig. 4.28. We ﬁnd that high pres-
sure appears on the outer part of the front surface where the ﬂuid velocity
is high. Flow-in occurs near the back surface due to the negative pressure.
The pressure on the ﬂat ends is very small due to the tangential direction of
the rotation axis. On the other hand, the shearing stresses are high on the
side surface and the outer corner. As a result, the drag force is large at the
side surface and the outer parts of the back surface.

4.3.2 Optical Rotor with Slopes on the Light Incident Surface
Velocity Vectors and Streamlines
The velocity vectors and the streamlines in the proximity of the cylindrical
rotor rotating at the speed of 3,000 rpm are analyzed for the refractive index
n2 = 1.5, slope angle a = 45◦, diameter 2r = 3 µm, and height h = 10 µm.
The results are shown in Fig. 4.31a and b. Figure 4.31a shows that the velocity
increases close to the rotor and the ﬂow goes upward near top A but down-
ward near the opposite top B, according to the counterclockwise rotation.
The streamlines in Fig. 4.31b show that the ﬂow goes outward and upward
in the proximity of the slope (h = 10 µm) but slightly outward in the middle

Pressure and Shearing Stress
Figure 4.32 shows pressure P (a), and shearing stress S (b), on the surface
of the rotor. A high pressure (1.24 pN µm−2) arises on the upper edge of the
slope where the ﬂuid velocity is high.
Flow-in occurs near the side wall due to the negative pressure. The pressure
on the ﬂat end is very low due to the tangential direction of the rotation axis.
On the other hand, the shearing stresses are large at the top of the edge
(2.24 pN µm−2). The shearing stress on the side surface is small, which leads
to a low ﬂuid ﬂow along the side surface.

Viscous Drag Force and Rotation Rate
Viscous drag force Mdrag acting on the surface of the rotor is evaluated
as described earlier. Table 4.3 shows a comparison of the drag force be-
tween computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) and the approximation method
for the 3,000 rpm optical rotors. The sum of the drag force on the slope
(6.37 pN µm−2) and the side wall (4.99 pN µm−2) is three times that on the
ﬂat end (3.56 pN µm−2).
Table 4.4 shows the drag force of each part of the rotor simulated by CFD
for 2r = 3 µm, and h = 3 µm at the rotation rate of 3,000 rpm. Figure 4.33
shows the drag force dependence on the rotor height calculated by CFD and
by the approximation method. It is clear that as the rotor height decreases, the
diﬀerence between drag forces calculated by CFD and by the approximation
method increases, as expected.
Assuming that the rotor is cylindrical, we can calculate rotation rate ω
by Mopt = Mdrag(= 4πµr2hω) where µ is the viscosity of the medium (µ =
1 mPa s). The correct rotation rate ω is adjusted by balancing optical torque

rates calculated by the approximation and by CDF for an a = 45◦rotor,
with the rotor height as a parameter. Figure 4.35 shows the rotation rates
obtained by the approximation method and by CDF, with slope angle as a
parameter. A laser power of 100 mW is directed onto the rotor with parallel
beam illumination.
From these ﬁgures, we conﬁrm that the slope eﬀect on the drag force
becomes strong for heights less than 10 µm or for slope angles greater than
30◦. The rotation rates calculated by CFD for a rotor with a 3 µm diameter
and 3 µm height are 0.67 (a = 45◦) and 0.56 (a = 60◦) times the approximated
values when the cylindrical-body drag force is 4πµr2hω.
4.3.3 Mixing Performance in a Microchannel
Mixing eﬃciency of an optical rotor designed to be used in micrototal analysis
systems (µ-TAS) has been studied by CFD [4.13]. The ﬁnite volume method
is used to discretize (4.19) and (4.20), in which the third-order upwind scheme
is used for the advection terms of the Navier–Stokes equation (4.20), and the

second-order central diﬀerencing scheme is used both for the viscosity terms
and the pressure terms of the Navier–Stokes equation (4.20) and for all the
terms of the continuity equation (4.19). For time marching, the implicit back-
ward Euler diﬀerencing scheme is used. The algorithm of the numerical solu-
tion is based on the SIMPLEC algorithm [4.12].
The shuttlecock optical rotor (d = 20 µm, w = 4 µm, t = 10 µm) is placed
at the center of a Y-shaped microchannel (30 µm width and 20 µm depth) and
rotates at speeds of 100–2,000 (typical 500) rpm. The corresponding Reynolds
number (Re = rωd2/4π) is 10−2 to 10−4. The ﬂuid used is water at room tem-
perature and its inlet ﬂuid speed is in the range of 0 to 100 µm s−1. Figure 4.36
shows the grid system of the Y-shaped microchannel and the rotor. The mesh

where Ci is the mixing volume ratio of the ith mesh, N is the total mesh

of no mixing and 1 in the state of complete mixing.
Figure 4.37a shows the relationship between mixing rate and rotation rate
with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = 0, inlet ﬂuid velocity as a parameter. The mixing
rate increases as the rotation rate increases and it becomes high for slow ﬂuid
velocity. Figure 4.37b shows the relationship between the mixing rate and
diﬀusion coeﬃcient with rotation rate ω = 0, inlet velocity as a parameter.
The mixing rate increases as the diﬀusion coeﬃcient increases and it becomes
high for low ﬂuid velocity.
Figure 4.38 shows the mixing rate dependence on the ratio of the wing top
speed (circumferential speed corresponding to ω) to inlet ﬂuid speed u. It is
found that the mixing rate depends on ω/u. Figure 4.39 shows the mixing rate

dependence on the ratio of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient to u. It is found that the
mixing rate depends on D/u. From these results, an enhancement eﬀect of
convection generated by the rotor and the diﬀusion of ﬂuids on the mixing
performance is conﬁrmed.
In microscale systems, the ﬂow is considered to be laminar and convective
mixing was considered to be negligible. Nevertheless, from the results obtained
earlier, it is conﬁrmed that the mixing eﬃciency increases due to convection
generated by the rotor, through the eﬀective increase of the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient.

We can choose the wing number according to the desired characteristics, i.e.,
stable rotation, high rotation rate, and high agitation in the medium, under
the conditions that the direction of surface III is parallel to the radial direction
and the shape of surface II is circular. These are illustrated in Fig. 4.40 for 3,
4, and 5 wings. Such rotors can be fabricated by micromachining [1.1] such
as dry etching [1.62], wet etching (photolithography) [1.23], and microphoto-
forming [1.27]. In the ﬁgure, photographs of the SU-8 photoresist rotors of

Figure 4.41 shows the photolithography process. Not only the exposure
and development conditions [4.14] but also the baking methods and condi-
tions are important, particularly for achieving the correct rotor shape and
avoiding adhesion between rotors [4.15]. An example of the fabricated three-
wing rotor is shown in Fig. 4.42 along with the mask. Roundness at the wing
top and swelling at the wing root are seen in the ﬁgure. To fabricate the cor-
rect shape, parallelism between the resist and the mask is important. We used
a hotplate instead of an oven to prevent resist deformation during prebakeing
and postbaking. We adjusted the baking temperature of 140◦C to polymerize
the resist ﬁrmly.

Fig. 4.43. Measured rotation rates for three kinds of rotors
We released the rotor into the laser trap environment by etching away the
aluminum under the resist. The measured rotation rates for three kinds of
rotors are shown in Fig. 4.43. Rotation rate varies according to the exposure
time (varies the rotor shape), but the maximum speed (corresponds to the
correct shape) is fast for small number of wings. Three wings provide the
fastest rotation in this experiment.
Fluorinated polyimide is also suitable for the microrotor because it is
highly transparent in the near-infrared region and it is easy to etch into a
particular shape using oxygen plasma. The fabrication process of the poly-
imide rotor is as follows [4.16]:
1. a polyimide solution is spin-coated onto an Si substrate, which is then
heated to 370◦C

4.4 Fabrication
151
2. a Si-based negative resist with high resistance to oxygen reactive ion-beam
etching (O2 RIE) is spin-coated onto the polyimide layer and exposed to
an electron beam
3. the polyimide layer is etched down to the Si substrate by O2 RIE
4. after removal of the resist, the microrotor are freed from the substrate by
ultrasonic vibration.
Fluorinated polyimide has a density of 1.49 and a refractive index of 1.53 at
a wavelength of 1.064 µm as listed in Table 3.3.
4.4.2 Microphotoforming
In order to increase the optical torque of the rotor, it is eﬀective to adopt a 3-D
structure with slopes on its upper surface. To fabricate such 3-D microstruc-
tures, photoforming is applied. However, the presently proposed photoforming
apparatus is large and requires a special laser beam (ultra-short-pulsed near-
infrared Ti:sapphire)or special resin (two-photon-absorbed urethane material)
[1.29, 4.17].
We developed a desktop microphotoforming apparatus using a DVD opti-
cal head and a visible light-curable resin (DF-200N, Nippon Kayaku Corp.),
both of which are commercially available [4.18]. Since the microstructure is
generated by scanning a focused laser beam to solidify the contour of a liq-
uid photopolymer, the resolution is determined by the laser beam intensity
distribution and the absorption of light within the polymer. To decrease the
solidiﬁed depth, a thin resin ﬁlm was made using a spinner, as shown in
Fig. 4.44
Figure 4.45 shows the shuttlecock optical rotor with a 30 µm diameter and
15 µm thickness. The fabrication conditions were a scan speed of 25 µm s−1,
scan pitch of 0.3 µm, single scan and a laser power of 0.35 mW. The overall
time was 12 min to fabricate 16 rotors.

Complicated 3-D microstructures were fabricated by stacking thin resin
layers that had been solidiﬁed into the cross-sectional shape using a DVD LD
with the wavelength of 650 nm. Table 4.6 shows the photoforming conditions
for the slope of the rotor. Figure 4.46 shows the 3-D design (upper), cross-
sections (middle) and fabricated layers (lower) of 5 µm thick each. It is found
that the fabricated layer shapes are similar to those of the corresponding cross
sections.

two techniques using the video frame time and the period of scattered light
variation [4.4].
4.5.1 Visualization of Microﬂow (Agitation)
In the actual evaluation, the microﬂow ﬁelds generated by the optical rotor are
analyzed using images obtained with a newly constructed evaluation system.
To obtain the images, we use two methods. One is the tracer method in
which we trace many particles suspended in the medium. The other is an
optical method in which we observe the medium density variation [4.20]. By
comparing the results of the two methods, we conﬁrm that the optical method
is appropriate for visualizing the overall microﬂow behavior.
Figure 4.47 shows the experimental setup for trapping and rotating the ro-
tor with an upward-directed YAG laser beam and for visualizing the microﬂow
using a high-speed camera. Figure 4.48 shows a photograph of the experimen-
tal apparatus. The rotor in the medium inside the chamber is secured at the
focal point of the NA = 1.4 objective lens.

To visualize the ﬂow ﬁeld in the proximity of the rotor, the light scattered
due to the medium density variation upon illumination at a grazing angle is
observed. The oblique illumination increases the image contrast, because only
the scattered light is observed. The sample chamber, in which optical rotors
and milk fat colloid are suspended in water, as shown in Fig. 4.49, is sealed
with a cover glass.

Tracer Method
Arbitrarily-shaped glass particles (n = 1.51, ρ = 2.54 g cm−3) ranging from
5 to 15 µm in size and the photoresist shuttlecock rotors (n = 1.6, ρ =
1.16 g cm−3) of 10 to 30 µm in diameter were used in the experiment. They are
transparent to the YAG laser wavelength of 1.06 µm, which prevents optical
damage.
Tracers added to mark the ﬂow included polystyrene, glass, gold, aluminum
oxide, diamond, tooth powder, pigment, a shampoo colloid and a milk fat col-
loid. Some of them are shown in Fig. 4.50. Polystyrene and glass are spherical,
but gold and aluminum have no deﬁnitive shape. The particles were dispersed
in water with a surface active agent, but the gold and aluminum were con-
densed due to electrostatic force.
Figure 4.51 shows the results for microﬂow analyzed by the tracer method
for the 1.0 µm glass beads in 30% glycerol solution. We recorded a 2.3-second
motion (71 frames) with a high-speed camera. The resolution was 640×240×8
bits per frame.
The velocity and the direction of each of beads #1 through #6 were traced
as the pathlines. In the ﬁgure, the following interesting characteristics of mi-
croﬂow are recognized.
1. The ﬂows are strong for tracers #2, #3, and #4, which were very close
at the rotor, but weak for #1, #5, and #6, which were at very distant
locations.
2. The ﬂows expand to two to three times the rotor diameter.
Figure 4.52 show the variation in the tracer velocity due to the rotor and the
Brownian motion. Microﬂow and the diﬀusion eﬀect will promote stirring or
mixing in microscale systems.

The following are the requirements for the tracers used with an optical
rotor. (1) They must be small (less than 1 µm in this case) and suﬃciently
dense, (2) The tracers should be prevented from undergoing Brownian motion,
and (3) The tracers should not be aﬀected by optical pressure. Condition (1)
is satisﬁed with an optical rotor of about 10 µm, and condition (2) is satisﬁed
by using glycerol to increase the medium viscosity. Since high density glycerol
aﬀects the rotor motion, heavy beads are suitable for the tracer. Concerning
condition (3), particles such as polystyrene, glass, and milk fat colloid were
not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the optical pressure, but metallic particles such
as gold and aluminum oxide were expelled from the laser focal point, as shown
in Fig. 4.53.

In the optical method, we observe the medium density variation. The micro-

medium density variation. We can see microﬂow around the rotors. Compared

by the optical method. Velocity vectors and the ﬂux amount around the mixer
are derived to evaluate the degree of agitation of the liquid. Through the
analysis, we conﬁrmed that both the rotor shape and the rotation velocity
aﬀect on microﬂow.
Optical rotors were trapped near the upper surface of the chamber, and
the rotation rate was varied to 80, 170, and 260 rpm by changing the laser
power. The velocity vectors due to the medium density variation caused by
the optical rotor was observed for diﬀerent rotation rates, as shown in Fig. 4.54
at the frame rate of 1/120 s.
4.5.2 Medium Density Pattern Tracking
These ﬂow-ﬁeld analyses can be carried out using a fast pattern tracking
algorithm based on the correlation between the density variation patterns
(Flow-vec 32, Library Corp.), as shown in Fig. 4.55. The measuring points are
located at 0.5 µm intervals in the observation plane. The correlation between
the medium density pattern in an element with size of 3.5 × 3.5 µm2 and that
in the search size are calculated to obtain the reliability, which is deﬁned as
the pattern tracking accuracy for the medium density variation. The velocity
of ﬂow at the measuring point can be calculated from the distance between
the measuring point in the current frame and the maximum correlation point
in the next frame, divided by the frame time (1/120 s).

The ﬂux amount is deﬁned here as the total sum of the absolute velocity

averaged over the frame time. Average ﬂux amount is also deﬁned as total
ﬂux amount divided by the number of measuring points in the observation

Figure 4.56 shows the relationship between the total ﬂux amount/reliability
and the search size for the rotation rates of 80, 170, and 260 rpms. The opti-
mum search size is determined by the maximum ﬂux amount. Arrows in the
ﬁgure show the calculated displacement of the mixer wing top per frame. We
can see that the optimum search size nearly equals 1.4 times the wing top
displacement per frame [4.19].

Microﬂow at diﬀerent depths was observed by placing a high-speed camera
along the optical axis. An optical mixer, 12 µm in thickness, was trapped
and horizontally rotated at 170 rpm in contact with the upper surface of the
chamber. Figure 4.57 shows the analyzed velocity vectors around the rotor at

260 rpm. In the ﬁgure, theoretical results for 100 and 200 rpm are also shown
for reference. Both results are in fairly good agreement, even in the microscale.
When an optical mixer, 9 µm in thickness, is 3-D trapped in an oﬀ-axis
position in the medium, it rotates vertically around the axis perpendicular
to the laser beam axis. The ﬂows are visualized with a frame rate of 120 at
speeds of 115, 155, and 215 rpm, as partly shown in Fig. 4.59. The velocity
vectors at the focal plane originate from the left wing, ﬂow into the right

wing, expand outward, and gradually decrease as the depth increases. The
ﬂux amount decreases gradually from focal point, as shown in Fig. 4.60
To improve the agitation eﬃciency, we fabricated three kinds of optical
rotors. Figure 4.61 shows the eﬀect of the number of wings of the rotor on
the rotation rate and ﬂux amount. Figure 4.62 shows the relationship between
the average ﬂux amount and rotation rate, with the number of wings as a
parameter. The rotation rate of a three-wing rotor reaches 600 rpm with a
laser power of 200 mW. The average ﬂux amount of a ﬁve-wing rotor is 1.15
times greater than that of the three-wing rotor because the ﬁve-wing rotor is
in contact with the liquid more frequently, even at the same rotation rate. We
also observed that the higher the rotation rate, the greater the ﬂux amount.
These results show that both the wing number and the rotation rate aﬀect
the ﬂux amount.

In summary, three kinds of optical rotors are proposed stirring the liquid
around them, and the characteristics that promote mixing are conﬁrmed. The
ﬂuidic velocity vectors around the 20-µm-diameter SU-8 rotors are visualized,
and the ﬂux amounts are derived at diﬀerent depths both theoretically and
experimentally.
The microﬂow arises within two to three times the rotor diameter and
thickness for the horizontal rotation, and the ﬂow goes not only outward but
also up and down. The average ﬂux amount gradually decreases as the depth
increases. The ﬂux amount of the ﬁve-wing rotor is 1.15 times greater than
that of the three-wing rotor at the same rotation rate. The velocity vectors of
the vertical rotation originate from the left wing and ﬂow into the right wing
and expand outward partly along the optical axis, which promotes convective
mixing.

4.6 Mixer Application for µ-TAS
Because the Reynolds number in a microchannel in future µ-TAS will be small,
mixing devices that increase two liquid contact areas are proposed to promote
the diﬀusion eﬀect. Interweaving of two liquids has been achieved by adopting
various structure geometries in a channel, such as micronozzle arrays and
intersecting channelswhich induce chaotic ﬂow, as shown in Fig. 4.63 [4.21].
These mixers have been characterized as static devices. On the other hand,
active micromixers with pressure perturbations that are applied transversally
to the main stream, as shown in Fig. 4.64 have been presented [4.22]. They
are called cross-channel mixers [4.23], fabricated by using MEMS technology,
in which chaotic-like mixing is achieved in an eﬃcient way. The optical mixer
proposed in this book is another type of active mixer to stir a liquid in a
microchannel [4.19].
µ-TAS is also called a Labs-on-a-chip. The chip will have components such
as inlets for loading the sample and reagent, microfabricated ﬂuidic channels

with a mixing chamber and an analyzing chamber, a detector of the reaction
products, and outlets for exhausting sample waste. The analyte specimen and
the reagents will be actuated by pressure force using syringe pumps.
Figure 4.65 shows the mixing part of the microchannel and the optical ro-
tor. The microchannel width and depth are both 50 µm. Such an optically
driven rotor is expected to be used as the mixer in future chemical Labs-on-
a-chip and have the advantage of remote control without the use of bearings.
Reaction results in the mixing part are analyzed by, for example, optical (ﬂuo-
rescence), thermal [4.24], electrochemical, and mass spectrographic methods.
Figure 4.66a shows the merging of ﬂows of NaOH solution (4 mmol L−1)
and BTB solution (BromoThymol Blue, 4 mmol L−1), both having the inlet
ﬂuid velocity of 3.3 × 103 µm s−1 with surfactants, and Fig. 4.66b shows the
optical mixer (d = 20 µm) having the rotation rate of 1,000 rpm at the laser
power of 200 mW. The mixer is held stable using optical tweezers even in such

To visualize the mixing of two liquids, 20% milk fat colloid is included
only in the NaOH solution. Figure 4.67a shows the ﬂows without mixer and
b shows the ﬂows with mixer. We can recognize stirred ﬂow of the milk fat
colloid in the NaOH solution. To conﬁrm the mixing of the two liquids, the
velocity vectors are analyzed for the two liquids, as shown in Fig. 4.68. Velocity
vectors appear only in the NaOH solution without mixer (a), but they appear
in both liquids due to the mixing by the optical rotor (b).
µ-TAS is expected to reduce inspection time or the amount of reagent
needed [4.25,4.26]. In order to promote convective mixing, a shuttlecock op-
tical mixer, which rotates in ﬂuids and is capable of stirring the ﬂuid around
it, is proposed and the following basic technologies are conﬁrmed:
1. mixer shape design by analyzing the optical torque by a ray optics model
2. microﬂow analysis around the mixer by CFD
3. mixer fabrication both by photolithography using an SU-8 and mi-
crophotoforming with a visible light-curable resin

Near Field
The near ﬁeld represents an electromagnetic evanescent ﬁeld that has its
intensity maximum at the surface and an exponentially decaying ﬁeld per-
pendicular to it. It is localized within a hundred nanometers. The near ﬁeld
cannot be probed by conventional light detectors because it does not propa-
gate. However, if we could access and control it, we would be able to observe or
read/write or fabricate beyond the wavelength resolution. These science and
technology ﬁelds, which include near-ﬁeld scanning microscopy, optical data
storage, and the processing industry, are also concerned with micromechanical
photonics.
In this chapter we describe the near ﬁeld’s features, theoretical analyses,
experimental analyses, and applications mainly related to optical storage.
5.1 Background
The evanescent ﬁeld is widely known as a solution to Maxwell’s equations
[5.1–5.4]. It is localized near the surface and decays exponentially within a
hundred nanometers. To excite the near ﬁeld, it is necessary to have the
following nonpropagating conditions, as shown in Fig. 5.1:
1. Attenuated total reﬂection (ATR): the use of a highly refractive prism is
the simplest method of producing a near ﬁeld. When a light is incident at
the interface from a high-refraction medium to a low-refraction medium
at an angle greater than that of total reﬂection, the light is reﬂected
totally to the high-refraction medium and a near ﬁeld is produced at the
low-refraction medium surface, as shown in Fig. 5.2.
2. An aperture smaller than the wavelength of light: if the aperture size is
smaller than the wavelength, the light does not propagate through the
aperture but produces evanescent light. An optical ﬁber with a sharpened
end is often used for this purpose.

3. An apertureless scattering probe: a metallic needle [5.5, 5.6] and a
nanometer-size metallic sphere [5.7, 5.8] are used for strong enhance-
ment of the near ﬁeld.
The idea of using a small aperture for high-resolution microscopy was re-
ported a long time ago. Pohl et al. [5.9] showed a high-resolution capability
(20 nm) by line scanning with a transparent probe coated with metal and hav-
ing a small aperture at the apex in 1884. Imaging in reﬂection by a scanning
near-ﬁeld microscopy (SNOM) was demonstrated with an aperture probe by
Fischer et al. in 1888 [5.10]. In the 1990s, Betzig at Bell Labs. invented a
pulled-ﬁber probe with a metal coating. He and his coworkers demonstrated
various applications in superresolution microscopy [5.11]. Ohtsu et al. fabri-
cated many sophisticated sharpened structured ﬁber probes and they are also
developing atom-manipulation techniques using near-ﬁeld light [5.3]. Kawata
et al. developed a new concept of physics and instrumentation by combining
near-ﬁeld and surface plasmon polaritons [5.4].
Driven by great expectations, various studies of microscopy were carried
out. However, success in practical use was delayed by problems of probe

fabrication reproducibility and an artifact caused by the vertical tip displace-
ment [5.12]. Using the near ﬁeld we can observe [5.11], read/write [5.13], and
fabricate [5.14] beyond the diﬀraction limit of the conventional optics.
5.2 Theoretical Analysis
The quantitative description of the near ﬁeld is given by vector theory. We can
obtain analytical solutions for only limited structures, resulting in a compu-
tational solution approach to Maxwell’s equations. The ﬁnite diﬀerence time
domain (FDTD) method [5.15] is often used for such an approach because a
new structure of interest can be modeled easily by systematic mesh generation.
5.2.1 FDTD Method
FDTD is a direct solution method for Maxwell’s equations by space-grid time-
domain techniques employing no potentials. It is based on volumetric sampling
of an unknown electric ﬁeld E and a magnetic ﬁeld H within and surrounding
the structure of interest, and over a period of time. The sampling in space is,
typically, more than 10 per wavelength. The sampling in time is selected to
ensure numerical stability of the algorithm. At present, the best choices for
the computational algorithm and mesh remain unclear.
Since this technique requires no special knowledge, FDTD is emerging in a
variety of ﬁelds of science and engineering. Optics-related ﬁelds are concerned
with near ﬁelds, microdisk resonators, photonic band-gap devices, and col-
liding spatial solitons. FDTD is becoming a standard method in these ﬁelds.
We consider the foundation of FDTD electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis using the
algorithm introduced by Yee in 1996 [5.16]. The main steps of the FDTD
algorithm are as follows:
1. Deﬁne the space domain to be computed
2. divide the domain into cells
3. rewrite Maxell’s equation (5.1) using the time and space derivatives
4. calculate E and H at each location under initial conditions and continue
the process cycle for the time step
∇× E = −µ∂H
∂t ,
∇× H = σE + ε∂E
∂t .
(5.1)
We introduce the following notation (in one spatial dimension), denoting
a space point in a uniform, rectangular lattice as:
(x, y, z, t) = (i∆x, j∆y, k∆z, n∆t),
(5.2)

170
5 Near Field
where ∆x, ∆y, and ∆z are the lattice space increment in the x-, y-, and z- axis,
respectively, and ∆t is the time increment, and i, j, k and n are integrals. Ab-
breviating ∆x, ∆y, ∆z, and ∆t, the expression can be rewritten more simply
as
F(x, y, z, t) = F n(i, j, k),
(5.3)
where (i, j, k) are the coordinates of the lattice. The ﬁnite-diﬀerence expres-
sions for the space derivatives used in the curl operators are central diﬀerence
in nature and second-order accurate.
Figure 5.3 shows the space–time chart of the Yee algorithm in one dimen-
sion showing the use of central diﬀerences for space derivatives and leapfrog
for time derivatives. E is positioned at t = (n −1)∆t, n∆t, (n + 1)∆t, and H
is positioned at t = (n −1/2)∆t, (n + 1/2)∆t. In actual case, En is derived
from En−1 at t = (n−1)∆t and Hn−1/2at t = (n−1/2)∆t and Hn+1/2 is de-
rived from Hn−1/2 and En. Figure 5.4 shows the position of the electric- and
magnetic-ﬁeld vector components in two dimension. E and H components are
positioned alternately, i.e., H is on every cell edge and E is between cells.
In three-dimensional (3-D) space, E and H components are positioned so
that every E component is surrounded by four circulating H components, and

From (5.13)–(5.18), it is found that H at the time step n+1/2 can be
obtained by E at n and H at n −1/2, E at n + 1 is obtained by H at n + 1/2
and E at n (see Fig. 5.3). The cycle begins again with the computation of E
components based on the newly obtained H. This process continues until the
solutions remain constant. To avoid numerical instability, the time increment

Moreover, to prevent the reﬂection at the outermost space–lattice planes of
the computational domain, absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) must be
introduced. Since ﬁrst-order Mur ABCs are eﬀective only for normally incident
plane wave, second-order Mur ABCs are often used [5.17]. On the other hand,
Berenger’s perfectly matched layer (PML) ABCs are eﬀective for the plane
waves of arbitrary incidence, polarization, and frequency [5.18]. In the case of
a perfect conductor, the electric ﬁeld equals zero on the surface.
5.2.2 Numerical Examples of Near Field Analysis
The following are examples of the application of FDTD to problems including
the interaction between a plane wave and typical subwavelength structures.
Example 5.1. Compute the electromagnetic ﬁeld around a small aperture on
the perfect conductor plane when a TM (p-polarized) plane wave is normally
incident, and show the intensity proﬁle in two dimensions.
Solution. Figure 5.5 shows (a) a process for analysis, and (b) a 2-D Cartesian
computational domain (1500 nm × 500 nm). We consider a TM (p-polarized)
plane wave normally incident on a 100-nm-diameter aperture with the para-
meters ∆x = ∆y = 1 nm, ∆t = 2.3586769 × 10−19 s and n = 3, 000. Figure 5.6
shows a numerical result in the domain of 75 nm×500 nm by FDTD, indicating
that the electric ﬁeld is enhanced at the edge and decays rapidly [5.19].

Solution. Figure 5.7 shows the relationship between Ex and n for a computa-
tional domain of 1, 500 nm×500 nm. Figure 5.8 shows the numerical results of
Ex, round-trip number as a parameter. The electromagnetic wave propagates
from the aperture and reﬂects at the upper boundary of the computational
domain leading to a round trip. The round-trip numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
correspond to the time steps 636, 1,908, 3,180, 4,452 and 5,724, respectively.
It is seen from the ﬁgure that the solution converges stably without the wave
reﬂection eﬀect.
Example 5.3. Compute Ex around the tapered optical ﬁber end with a silica
core and a perfect conductor clad shown in Fig. 5.9. Compare the obtained
three Exs for the diameters of (a) 34 nm, (b) 68 nm, and (c) 136 nm in two
dimensions.
Solution. Figure 5.10 shows numerical results of Ex for the TM (p-polarized)
plane wave. The evanescent light becomes sharp as the diameter of the aper-
ture becomes small. To obtain a high resolution it is necessary to make the
probe-sample distance short.

5.3 Experimental Analysis
In order to observe the near ﬁeld, the evanescent light scattering characteris-
tics of a tip probe should be understood. In this section, we ﬁrst compare the
characteristics of diﬀerent tip probes. Next we measure the evanescent ﬁeld
intensity by detecting the scattered light by a photocantilever, vibrating at
its mechanical resonant frequency, placed near the interface. Then we observe
the proﬁle of a topological grating by scanning the photocantilever. At last we
observe the distribution of the refractive index grating and topological grat-
ing, by detecting the scattered light of an Ar+ laser, by scanning a nanogold
particle optically trapped by a YAG laser, two-dimensionally on the surface.
5.3.1 Comparison of Near-Field Probes
When a sample is illuminated by a light the evanescent ﬁeld is locally excited
near the surface according to its surface property and structure. This evanes-
cent ﬁeld is scattered by a tip probe and then can be detected by a photodiode
(PD) or a photomultiplier tube (PMT). We can observe the surface by scan-
ning the probe two-dimensionally on the surface. The imaging mechanism of
the SNOM is diﬀerent from that of conventional optical microscopy; the scat-
tered light intensity is detected as a result of the interaction between the tip
probe and the sample surface. With growing understanding of the underlying
probe-sample interaction mechanism, SNOM has found applications in many
scientiﬁc and industrial ﬁelds.
As a typical near-ﬁeld probe, a small aperture [5.3], a metallic needle
[5.5, 5.6], and a small metallic sphere [5.7, 5.8] are well known. The most
popular probe is a metal-coated sharpened optical ﬁber with a subwavelength
aperture at the end. We use this aperture to illuminate the surface and collect

the scattered light to propagate it to the PMT placed at the other end, leading
to the prevention of background light noise. The metal-coated ﬁber has a cutoﬀ
frequency for light transmission, i.e., an aperture minimum of 48 nm due to
skin depth for aluminum coating.
We use a cantilever or a metallic needle as an apertureless probe. The probe
is ideal in terms of resolution and ﬁeld intensity. Its spatial resolution is higher
than that of the aperture probe because of the smaller radius of the apex. The
near-ﬁeld intensity is much stronger than that of the aperture probe because of
the ﬁeld enhancement eﬀect [5.7,5.20]. The probe is easy to fabricate and has
a wide spectrum range owing to no waveguide, but the surrounding stray light
must be fully removed. There are two scanning methods, the constant height
mode and the constant distance mode. We need the same control technology as
that used for scanning tunnel microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM).
As a small metallic probe, we use an optically trapped gold particle [5.8,
5.21]. The metal particle scatters the surface plasmon excited depending on
the sample surface property and the scattered light is gathered by an objective
lens guiding it to a PMT. The scattered light includes information not only
on the optical, physical, chemical, mechanical properties but also the proﬁle.
We need to discriminate between these eﬀects [5.12]. Trapping force strength
is very weak (on the pN order), thereby not destroying the sample. So we need
not control the distance (gap) between the probe particle and the sample. The
metal particle probe is considered to have the following advantages (1) It has
a high experimental reproducibility depending on the shape and size of the
particles being made, (2) It does not require control of above mentioned gap,
(3) It not only has the ability to obtain a surface property but also obtains the
spectroscopic data of the sample. Table 5.2 shows the performance comparison
between the three.
5.3.2 Photocantilever Probe
To increase SNR for an apertureless SNOM, it is necessary to distinguish
the scattered light (signal) produced by the probe from the background light
(noise). One method is to place the detector close to the probe apex. A pho-
tocantilever is a photosensitive Si-based microfabricated cantilever with a PD

to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) allowing z distance regulation. The pho-
tocantilever is moved close to the sample surface and the distance between
the cantilever and the surface is detected from the focus error signal of the
optical head placed above the cantilever.
Experimental Setup
Figure 5.14 shows a photograph of an AFM/SNOM setup mounted on a
vibration-damped table. An He–Ne laser (this side) incident to a prism and
a microscope (other side) are used to observe the sample and the cantilever
tip, which is helpful in aligning the setup. An evanescent light is produced at
the prism surface by the total internal reﬂection arrangement. The prism is
mounted on a cylindrical PZT, allowing xyz movement. The z movement is
used for the gap (distance) control and xy for 2-D scanning. Since the piezo-
electric transducer has characteristics of creep and hysteresis, it is driven by a
small voltage or with feedback control. Figure 5.15 shows a sketch of the main
part of the setup using the photocantilever.

Fig. 5.16. Focus error signal representing typical S-shape curve of optical head
The photocantilever tip scatters the localized evanescent light changing to
a propagating light to be detected by the PD. Since the PD is integrated very
close to the tip, the SNR is markedly increased compared with the conven-
tional arrangement used in the PMT method.
A small gap between the cantilever and the sample surface (displacement
of the tip) is detected as the focus error signal of the optical head. Figure 5.16
shows a focus error signal representing a typical S-shape curve. From this S-
shape curve, it is found that the dynamic range becomes approximately 29 µm.
This optical head’s focus error detection makes the setup simpler resulting in
better manipulability than that of the combined laser source and quadrant
PD arrangement.
Measurement of Evanescent Light Distribution
First, a 7-mW He–Ne laser incident to a prism at an angle of 45◦, refracts
and goes through the prism and reﬂects at the upper surface creating an
evanescent light by the total internal reﬂection. Figure 5.17 shows the actual
prism conﬁguration: three corner prisms at 45◦are attached together by an
optical bond (refractive index of 1.55) and black paper sheets are inserted
between the prism boundaries to prevent random reﬂection of light.

Second, the photocantilever is moved close to the prism surface with the
vibration of its resonance frequency (4.2 kHz) at an amplitude of approxi-
mately 500 nm. The cantilever tip scatters the evanescent light and the PD
close to the tip detects the scattered light. To approach the tip to the surface
in the nanometer range, both manual control (rough positioning) and piezo-
electric control (ﬁne positioning) are required. The distance between the tip
and the sample surface is obtained by the focus error signal of the optical
head.
Figure 5.18 shows the evanescent light intensity with the cantilever ampli-
tude of 550 nm (a), 700 nm (b), and 1,400 nm (c). An FFT low-pass ﬁlter is
used to remove noises resulting in solid lines in the ﬁgure. In the cases of (b)
and (c), a ﬂat signal region appears during the period when the cantilever tip
reaches the prism surface owing to a large vibration amplitude.
Simultaneous light and gap (distance) observations lead to the evanescent
ﬁeld intensity distribution as shown “experimental” in Fig. 5.19. It is found

Surface Proﬁle Observation
An optical disk tracking groove (1.6 µm pitch, 0.1 µm in depth) is line-scanned
at a pitch of 50 nm in the constant height mode, and the scattered light from
the evanescent ﬁeld at the groove surface is detected by the photocantilever.
Figure 5.20 shows a gray-scale image of the groove. Scince the intensity of the
image is proportional to the scattered light due to the evanescent ﬁeld, the
image represents the proﬁle of the sample.
In summary, an apertureless near-ﬁeld optical-imaging method is presented
by exploiting a photocantilever with a PD integrated very close to the tip.
This aperturless SNOM can oﬀer substantially improved spatial resolution, as
well as combined operation with AFM.
5.3.3 Gold Particle Probe
It is well known that surface plasmon existing on a metal surface and a
metal/dielectric interface causes strong ﬁeld enhancement at the interface

5.3 Experimental Analysis

[5.20]. According to the theoretical analysis, surface refractive index distrib-
ution mapping with a high contrast is predicted to be possible [5.7]. A metal
particle probe is considered to have the advantages of high experimental re-
producibility, not requiring gap control, and not only the ability to obtain the
surface image, but also to obtain the spectroscopic data of the sample. The
scattering eﬃciency of a silver particle is higher than that of a gold particle,
but the latter is more chemically stable. Therefore a gold particle is frequently
used as an SNOM probe.
Sugiura et al. [5.8] observed a dip on a cover glass and a gold colloidal
particle adhering to the cover glass. However, these images were thought to
have been an artifact problem due to the vertical displacement of the gold
probe [5.12]. On the other hand, the following are observed for a refractive
index grating on a ﬂat surface, which was made on a planar light waveguide
circuit (PLC) [5.24], by scanning an optically trapped 100-nm-diameter gold
particle. The scattered Ar+ laser light from the gold particle has a high inten-
sity due to the high refractive index of the grating with periods of 1.06 and
0.53 µm, both by s- and p-polarized illuminations.
Moreover, the surface proﬁle of an optical disk tracking groove is also
observed with and without the gold particle and the results compared to
discuss the artiﬁcial eﬀect due to the vertical displacement of the particle
caused by the surface topology.
Experimental Setup

Figure 5.22a shows a photograph of the setup. The gold particle at the focal
point of the objective lens is in the medium of a coverslip-shield chamber and
is pushed onto the sample surface and scanned as shown in Fig. 5.22b.
An Ar+ laser (λ = 488 nm) is focused through the same objective to
illuminate the particle. The scattered light from the gold particle is collected
through the objective and imaged on the pinhole (5 µm in diameter) in front
of a PMT. The scattered light variation due to the interaction between the
gold particle and the sample surface is recorded on a personal computer (PC).
A CCD camera observes the operation of the gold particle in the medium. All
the optical elements, except the mirrors to guide the Nd:YAG laser and Ar+
laser, are installed inside the optical box for easy operation.
Trapping Principle
A metallic Rayleigh particle (much smaller than the wavelength) can be op-
tically trapped at the focal point by the gradient force. The particle in such
a tightly focused beam is polarized by the electric ﬁeld and drawn into the
beam focus by the large intensity gradients created in both the axial and
transverse directions. The gradient force Fgrad for the Rayleigh particle is
given by [5.4,5.8]
Fgrad = 1
4n1α grad

|E|2 
,
(5.20)
where n1 is the refractive index of the medium, α is the polarizability of the
gold particle and E is the electric ﬁeld. The polarizabiliy is given as
α = 4πεεr
m2 −1

(5.21)
where m is the relative refractive index of the particle to the medium, r is the
radius and ε is the electric permitivity of the particle, and εr is the free-space

Fgrad in the transverse direction and in the axial direction were calculated
for the gold particle refractive index n2 = 0.272 + i7.07, the gold particle
diameter 2r = 100 nm, the medium refractive index n1 = 1.33, the objective
lens NA = 1.3, and the Gaussian laser power is 20 mW as listed in Table 5.3.
We found from Fig. 5.23 that the gradient force along the transverse direction
is eight times greater than that along the axial direction. This result shows
that the trapped particle is very stable along the transverse direction but
unstable along the optical axis, which leads to the particle being trapped and
pushed onto the sample surface by the upward-directed beam.
Here, we estimate the forces [5.26] between the optically trapped particle
and the sample surface for reference. See the problems at the end of this
chapter.

Fig. 5.24. Dependence of minimum trapping power on scanning velocity of optically
trapped gold particle at diﬀerent viscosities
where µ and n1 are the viscosity and refractive index of the suspending
medium, respectively; c is the speed of light, and His the height of the sample
chamber (150 µm) [5.27]. Qmax is found from the maximum gradient force at
1.49/(2π/λ)NA = 193 nm along the transverse direction.
Although the calculated result is based on an aberration-free optical sys-
tem, the actual trapping characteristics are aﬀected by the color aberration of
the objective lens (for near infrared λ = 1.06 µm) and the spherical aberration
due to the refractive index diﬀerence between the immersion oil (1.52) and
the medium (1.33).
Figure 5.24 shows the dependence of the minimum trapping power P trans
min
on the scanning velocity of an optically trapped gold particle for diﬀerent
viscosities, which were controlled by altering the glycerol density. P trans
min
was
measured as the minimum power needed to trap the bead moving at the ve-
locity v in water. P trans
min
increases as scanning velocity increases, but decreases
as viscosity increases. However, if we increase the laser power to hold the gold
particle in position, the trapping becomes rather unstable because Brownian
motion hastens due to the temperature increase resulting from the light ab-
sorption. The addition of glycerol is eﬀective in slowing down Brownian motion
by increasing viscosity.
Observation of PLC Refractive Index Grating
The sample for the trapped-particle probe is a refractive index grating fabri-
cated by UV exposure through a phase mask under the conditions outlined
in Table 5.4 [5.28] The grating is formed in a cladding layer (30 µm thick)
on a planar light waveguide circuit (PLC) as shown in Fig. 5.25. Figure 5.26a
shows the top view of the grating obtained by optical microscopy. The grating
period of 1.06 µm (zeroth order) is clearly observed but the grating period of
0.53 µm (ﬁrst order) is only partially visible. Figure 5.26b shows a sketch of

We observed the scattered Ar+ laser light (P = 0.13 mW) by the 100 nm
gold particle optically trapped by a Nd:YAG (P = 25 mW) laser, which was
scanned over the refractive index grating at the PLC surface. The scanning ve-
locity and pitch were 1.6 µm s−1 and 50 nm, respectively. Observation time for
the square 5 µm × 5 µm was 5 min. These conditions are outlined in Table 5.5.

tained by gold particle probe with p-polarized illumination
Figure 5.27 shows the SNOM image (scattered light intensity) of the re-
fractive index grating produced by a gold particle probe with p-polarized illu-
mination (electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to the gratings as shown). Figure 5.28
shows the SNOM image (scattered light intensity) with s-polarized illumi-
nation (electric ﬁeld is parallel to the gratings as shown). We can clearly
recognize the grating pitch of 1.06 µm in both images.
Figure 5.29 shows the relationship between scattered light intensity and
the refractive index grating distribution. The scattered lights are averaged
for ten data lines. The scattered averaged light corresponds to the grating
distribution of the periods of 1.06 and 0.53 µm for both p- and s-polarized
illuminations. The higher-order-grating of 0.53 µm can also be seen for the
100 nm gold particle. By collecting the scattered light under a scanning gold
particle that induces a local electric ﬁeld, we have resolved two individual
refractive index periods on the sample surface. We conﬁrm that the optical
near ﬁeld is eﬀective for observing the sample surface beyond the diﬀraction
limit of optical microscopy [5.29].
Next, we investigated the possibility of proﬁling the topography of the
sample surface. Figure 5.30 shows a sectional view of the optical disk tracking
groove, which is observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The period
is 1.6 µm, 0.1 µm deep, and the groove edge width is 200 nm.

surface proﬁle. On the other hand, the scattered light without the gold parti-
cle (broken line) has a single peak at the groove edge. The diﬀerence between
the two (bold solid line) seems to correspond to the surface topology because
the eﬀect of the laser light reﬂection is removed and the vertical displacement
of the gold particle appears due to the scanning on the groove.
In summary, the near ﬁeld for a refractive index grating fabricated on
a PLC is observed by scanning an optically trapped 100-nm-diameter gold
particle. The amplitude for the refractive index modulation of the cladding
layer (index 1.45) is estimated to be between 0.001 and 0.002. Stable trapping
and scanning occur with a Gaussian laser beam at a scan velocity of 1.6 µm s−1
and a Nd:YAG laser power of 25 mW. The scattered Ar+ laser light from the
gold particle is strong at high refractive indexes of the grating with periods
of 1.06 and 0.53 µm, both by s- and p-polarized illuminations.
In addition, an observation under p-polarization was also carried out for
the topographical optical disk tracking groove. The scattered light from the
gold particle was strong at the groove edge and had split peaks corresponding

5.4 Future Applications
193
to the gradient of the surface proﬁle, whereas the scattered light without a
gold particle had no split peaks.
From the result mentioned earlier, we conﬁrm that an optically trapped
gold particle is eﬀective in observing both the physical and topological prop-
erties of a sample. Further investigation will be required to clarify the exact
eﬀect of the vertical displacement of the particle, i.e., to distinguish the probe
vertical displacement eﬀects from the SNOM signal [5.12].
On the other hand, to improve the spatial resolution further, the robust-
ness of the optically trapped particle must be increased by an increase in
medium viscosity or by a follow up control of the particle position [5.30].
5.4 Future Applications
For future ultrahigh density optical storage, the so-called fourth generation
optical disk, many types of methods are being proposed. These methods
are holography [5.31,5.32], superresolution near-ﬁeld structure (super-RENS)
recording [5.33], near ﬁeld recording [5.34], and a 3-D recording [5.35]. Holo-
graphic storage is expected to have the possibility of storing over 1 terabyte
of data on a 120 mm diameter disk for data archiving [5.32]. In this sec-
tion, near-ﬁeld methods, particularly super-RENS, are introduced in detail.
Super-RENS has the merit that a recording apparatus the same as that of a
conventional optical storage system can be used and is considered to have the
highest potential for on-line storage.
5.4.1 Conventional Superresolution
I would like to start to explain beyond the diﬀraction limit readout principle
(superresolution) [5.36], which is used actually for today’s digital versatile
disk (DVD). Fig. 5.33 shows the pit size comparison between a CD, a DVD,
a next-generation DVD and a near-future optical disk. The pit size decreases
owing to not only the short wavelength [5.37] and high objective NA but also
the superresolution scheme.
We can make a write mark inﬁnitesimally small by choosing the critical
thermal conditions so that only the peak area of the temperature distribution
corresponds to the writable temperature. This is called “brush tip record-
ing”. However, information bits cannot be detected when two marks are in-
cluded in a diﬀraction-limited spot (λ/NA) in conventional readout as shown
in Fig. 5.34a.
Nevertheless, bits can be detected by superresolution because its eﬀective
aperture is restricted within a crescent-shaped region, as shown in Fig. 5.34b.
Fig. 5.34c shows a spot intensity proﬁle and the temperature distribution in a
mask layer. The material is melted in the rear area of the light spot because
the absorbed heat dissipated in the moving disk direction. The reﬂectance is
designed to be very low for the melted region so that it works as a mask.

As a result, the superresolution readout is possible through a crescent-shaped
aperture thermally formed in a mask layer [5.36].
In actual case, a medium with a mask layer/protective layer/recording
layer is formed as shown in Fig. 5.35a. Some type of dye or phase change
medium is employed as a mask layer. We can evaluate the eﬀect of a thermally
induced mask on the performance of an optical disk for a model shown in
Fig. 5.35b. We assume that the thermally induced mask can be represented

by an ellipse with a variable shape and a relative position with respect to the
center of the laser spot.
Simulation has been performed to evaluate the modulation transfer func-
tion (MTF) of this system. First, the point-spread function h(u, v) of the disk
system is calculated and then multiplied by the mask function f(u, v) on the
disk plane. Here, the mask function is represented as an ellipse with radii a
and b, and with the relative shift of δx with respect to the center of the read-
out laser spot. For simplicity, we assume that the reﬂectivity of the mask is
0% and that of the aperture 100%.
Figure 5.36a shows the calculated MTF for R0 = 1.1 µm, a = R0, b = R0/2
where NA = 0.45, λ = 0.78 µm and R0 = 1.22/2NA [5.38]. It is found that the
MTF depends on the relative position of the mask and the superresolution

eﬀect reaches a maximum with δx = 0.8. Figure 5.36b shows the same results
for a = R0/2 and b = R0 by changing the mask shape elongated perpendicular
to the track by the mask rotation of 90◦. This perpendicularly elongated mask
enables us to cover more of the read spot, resulting in a higher MTF compared
with that of (a). As a result, it is conﬁrmed that the MTF depends strongly
on both the shape and relative position of the mask.
5.4.2 Near-ﬁeld Recording
Ultrahigh-density optical storage is performed by switching a material phase
or a magnetization point by point using the light energy from an aperture
ﬁber probe. Heat-assist recording is particularly useful for magnetic recording
on ﬂux-detectable media because of the high sensitivity of giant magnetore-
sistive (GMR) devices [5.39]. There are mainly three read/write schemes for
an ultrahigh-density optical near-ﬁeld storage; a scanning probe microscope
(SPM), an optically switched laser (OSL) head, and a solid immersion lens
(SIL).
Scanning Probe Microscopy
There are various types of SPM storage; STM-based, AFM-based, MFM-
based and SNOM-based storages. Figure 5.37 shows an SNOM-based stor-
age [5.40] using an Al-coated ﬁber probe and a phase change medium (GeS-
bTe). An aperture probe induces an evanescent light, heating the nanometer
area, changing the medium phase from crystal to amorphous such that the
reﬂectivity of the illuminated area decreases. The smallest mark size obtained
is 60 nm in diameter, which corresponds to 170 Gb in.−2.

5.4 Future Applications
197
To achieve a high-speed readout, the gap control between the probe and
the medium sample is realized using an SNOM slider head, which consists
of a ﬂying slider and an air-bearing spindle motor. However, readout speed
is basically restricted with the resonant frequency of the gap control system.
A schematic diagram of proto-type SNOM slider head is shown in [5.40].
The experimental results indicate the possibility of achieving a density
over 100 Gb in.−2 and a readout speed over 2 Mb s−1. However, some technical
problems such as nanometer size aperture probe productivity, precise gap and
tracking control for each track independently remain unsolved.
Optically Switched Laser Head
A lensless ﬂying optical head suitable for near-ﬁeld recording arrangements
was ﬁrstly proposed by Ukita et al. in 1987 [5.33,5.41,5.69]. A tapered laser
diode attached on a slider forms an extremely short-external-cavity (ESEC)
with a phase change optical disk as described in Chap. 2. This is called an
OSL head due to its working mechanism.
After ten years, Partovi et al. [5.42] fabricated a very small aperture laser
(VSAL) for near-ﬁeld recording and Chen et al. [5.43] reported a method for
producing a VSAL from a low-cost, commercial index guided edge diode laser.
Recently, Kataja et al. [5.44] presented a numerical study of near-ﬁeld writing
on a phase change optical disk.
This direct read/write scheme by a laser diode is thought to be a promising
approach for near-ﬁeld storage because of its structure simplicity, smallness,
and low cost.
Solid Immersion Lens/Solid Immersion Mirror (SIM)
To overcome the fragility and yield of ﬁber probes of an SPM storage, the
use of an SIL [5.45] or an SIM [5.46] on a ﬂying head has been proposed and
studied. An SIL has a higher numerical aperture (NA) and is easier to fabri-
cate than an SIM, however, its lens center is more diﬃcult to align. The ﬂying
height of this head is 20 nm at present [5.47]. Use of an SIL/SLM is not re-
stricted by readout speed but restricted by area recording density due to NA.
However, these devices are also suitable for heat-assisted magnetic record-
ing (HAMR), avoiding the superparamagnetic limit of the HDD as shown in
Fig. 5.38.
HAMR schemes combining a bow-tie antenna attached on a ﬂying slider
are under development to achieve storage densities greater than 1 Tb in.−2
(corresponding to a mark size of 25 nm) in many institutes. Moreover, to
achieve recording data rates of 500 MHz, the thermal response time of the
medium must be less than 1 ns and a temperature rise of at least a 200◦C is
required. From thermal modeling calculation, approximately 1 mW of optical
power will cause 200◦C temperature rise in a 25 nm spot of a recording ﬁlm
stack [5.48]. Techniques based on apertures, antennas, waveguides, SILs and

SIMs have been suggested for delivering a substantial amount of optical power.
However, many practical technologies for HAMR have remained unsolved to
date.
5.4.3 Super-RENS Optical Disk
The near-ﬁeld recording schemes described earlier have diﬃculties in fabricat-
ing a nanometer-size probe with reproducibility and distance control between
a probe and a recording medium. Why is not the conventional superresolution
scheme using a mask layer employed? Tominaga et al. [5.33] proposed beyond
the diﬀraction limit optical readout in the near ﬁeld using superresolution
structure in 1998. Transmission eﬃciency of very small apertures is thought
to decay as d−4, where d is the aperture size, but it can be markedly enhanced
with the aid of surface plasmons and localized surface plasmons [5.49,5.50].
There are three types of beyond the diﬀraction limit optical readout using
super-RENS. The ﬁrst is by a transparent aperture formed in an Sb mask
layer [5.33]. The mask layer is uniformly crystallized but the high tempera-
ture region of the super-RENS readout power opens a small aperture sim-
ilar to the superresolution technique [5.38]. This type optical disk consists
of PC-substrate (0.6 mm)/SiN (170 nm)/Sb (15 nm)/SiN (30 nm)/GeSbTe
(15 nm)/SiN (20 nm). The success of 90 nm mark length readout and direct
observation of the near-ﬁeld aperture [5.51] formed on the super-RENS, the
phase change mechanism for two layers (mask and recording layers) [5.52]
and thermal lens model of the Sb thin ﬁlm [5.53] have been reported, but the
carrier to noise ratio (CNR) has been poor (approximately 15 dB for 100 nm
marks).

5.4 Future Applications
199
The second is by the aperture formed with the Ag nanoparticle ring
in the mask layer (AgOx) and the CNR is increased by 20 dB as that of
the transparent-aperture type described earlier [5.54]. The CNR increase is
thought due to the plasmon scattering by Ag particles. This type optical disk
consists of PC-substrate (0.6 mm)/ZnSiO2 (170 nm)/AgOx (15 nm)/ZnSiO2
(15 nm)/GeSbTe (15 nm)/ZnSiO2 (20 nm). The functional structures of AgOx
thin ﬁlm for near-ﬁeld recording has reported [5.55]. The aggregated Ag clus-
ter produced by a lower input energy, high reﬂectivity, scatters near ﬁeld
eﬃciently and the Ag ring produced by a higher input energy, low reﬂectiv-
ity, not only conﬁnes the input light energy for writing but also enhances the
scattering ﬁelds for reading.
Kataja et al. [5.56] studied the AgOx super-RENS phenomena numerically
using a 2-D FDTD method. They indicated that a super-RENS structure hav-
ing an AgOx active layer can produce beyond the difraction limit resolution
when the aperture surrounded by small Ag particles formed and ﬁlled with a
low index material such as O2. Recently, read/write characteristics have been
studied through systematic experiments and the detaild mechanism to explain
the Ag type super-RENS has been proposed more clearly [5.57].
This mechanism by a deformed gas bubble associated with metallic
nanoparticles was also elucidated for a platinum oxide super-RENS disk.
The CNR of over 47 dB for 100 nm mark length was obtained for the
optical disk with the following structure: PC–substrate (0.6 mm)/ZnS–
SiO2 (170 nm)/PtO1.6 (4 nm)/ZnS–SiO2 (40 nm)/AIST (60 nm)/ZnS–SiO2
(20 nm) [5.58,5.59].
The third is a huge change in the refractive index generated in a focused
laser spot. Tominaga et al. [5.60] have proposed a ring aperture formed by
ferroelectric catastrophe in AgInSbTe recording medium. This superresolution
aperture can be observed between 350◦C and 400 ◦C, resulting in a second
phase transition from a hexagonal to a rhombohedral structure. This type
optical disk consists of PC–substrate (0.6 mm)/ZnSiO2 (130 nm)/AgInSbTe
(40 nm)/ZnSiO2 (100 nm) [5.61]. Mask layer does not required.

Here, write and read mechanism of super-RENS optical disk of PC–substrate
(0.6 mm)/SiN (170 nm)/Sb (15 nm)/SiN (30 nm)/GeSbTe (15 nm)/SiN (20 nm)
is presented by the results obtained from the experiments in various read/write
conditions and theoretical analyses for a six-layer ﬁlm reﬂectivity.

conﬁguration and the parameters of materials for the medium.
In order to determine the amorphous level of the mask and recording layers
in super-RENS readout, we measured write power dependence of signal ampli-
tude with an oscilloscope and CNR with a spectrum analyzer. They were mea-
sured for two conditions, just after writing with read power of Pr = 1.5 mW
(readout #1) and the super-RENS readout with Pr = 6.0 mW (readout #2)
as shown in Fig. 5.41. Readout #3 with Pr = 1.5 mW is for reference. We
compared these two signals (readout #1 and readout #2) in Fig. 5.42 and
estimated the phase change levels of the medium.
First, read power dependence of CNR for various mark length written at
the power of 7.0 mW for the medium velocity of 1.9 m s−1 is shown in Fig. 5.43.
For long marks (1,000–3,000 nm), CNRs are high and almost independent of

written many times on one track until the signal level become saturated. For
long marks of 3,000 nm the signal level changes (decreases) clearly both the
write power 3.5 mW and 6.5 mW from as-depo to amorphous and reaches
two states of halfway amorphous and complete amorphous. It is not clear for
short marks of 200–500 nm, but the signal level changes (decreases) at 5.0 and
9.0 mW. This is because that the marks are much smaller than the laser spot
size.
Figure 5.45 shows a write power dependence of CNR measured for read-
out#2. For long marks of 3,000 nm, CNR increases drastically at the write
power 6.5 mW, which corresponds to the write power of Fig. 5.44. Figure 5.46
shows typical signals for as-depo (Pr = 1.5 mW), just after writing (Pr =
1.5 mW), and super-RENS (Pr = 6.0 mW) at the write power of Pw = 6.0 mW
and Pw = 9.0 mW. These signal levels obtained experimentally agree well with
those obtained theoretically from the reﬂectivity calculation for a six-layer thin
ﬁlm super-RENS. From these results, we conﬁrm that the Sb-super-RENS has
two states; one is due to the change of only mask layer (halfway amorphous),
the other due to the change of both mask and recording layer (complete amor-
phous).

Aperture-type super-RENS working model
Figure 5.47 shows a model of working mechanism for the super-RENS obtained
from the experimental results given earlier:
1. In the case of suﬃcient write power (Pw = 8.0–9.0 mW for 300 nm mark),
the heat reaches the lower recording layer, and both mask and recording
layers change from as-depo to amorphous (Fig. 5.47b). After super-RENS
readout, the mask layer is crystallized uniformity but small high temper-
ature region behaves the aperture just like a superresolution technique
(Fig. 5.47c).
2. In the case of insuﬃcient write power (Pw = 3.0–7.5 mW for 300 nm mark),
the heat dose not reach the recording layer, and only upper mask layer
change from as-depo to amorphous (Fig. 5.47d). After super-RENS read-
out, the signal does not appear because there are no marks on recording
layer (Fig. 5.47e).

In summary, both mask and recording layers change from as-depo to
amorphous in write process and the mask layer uniformly changes to amor-
phous in read process is presented. According to the conventional superres-
olution mechanism, the very small high temperature region in the focused
spot behaves as an aperture and makes it possible to detect marks less than
diﬀraction limit on the recording layer.
Ag-Super-RENS (Scattered Type)
In this paragraph, following read/write mechanism for the scattered-type
super-RENS optical disk using a silver oxide (AgOx) mask layer will be
presented experimentally: The AgOx mask layer has ﬁve possible states de-
pending on the input laser power; AgOx (as-depo), uniformly dispersed Ag
particles (after the initialization of 3.5 mW), Ag cluster (4.0–5.0 mW), Ag dif-
fusion (5.5–7.5 mW), and Ag ring structure (greater than 8.0 mW) for an ob-
jective lens numerical aperture of NA = 0.5, a laser wavelength of λ = 826 nm
and a medium velocity of 2 m s−1. On the other hand, the GeSbTe record-
ing layer has states; crystal, halfway amorphous, completely amorphous and
gas bubble associated with Ag particles. At the superresolution read power
(4 mW), the mask layer will have Ag ring structure that increases both the
CNR and the resolution limit.
A scattered-type super-RENS disk using a silver oxide (AgOx) mask layer
has been proposed to improve the CNR markedly. The small metal particles
in the gas bubble pit formed in write process enhanced the near ﬁeld (surface
plasmon on the particles) as shown in the upper ﬁgure of Fig. 5.48. Ho et al.
found that the functional structure [5.55] of AgOx depends on the write power
as shown in the lower ﬁgure. The aggregated Ag nanocluster (having high
reﬂectivity due to Ag dots) eﬃciently scatters the near ﬁeld and the Ag ring
(having high transmission due to a nanoaperture) not only conﬁnes the input

et al. numerically studied the AgOx super-RENS phenomena using a 2-D
FDTD method [5.56]. They indicated that an AgOx super-RENS structure
can be produced beyond the diﬀraction limit resolution when the aperture
surrounded by small Ag particles that were formed and ﬁlled with a low index
material such as O2.
In the following, the read/write mechanism of a super-RENS with the
structure: PC–substrate (0.6 mm)/ZnSiO2 (170 nm)/AgOx (15 nm)/ZnSiO2
(15 nm)/GeSbTe (15 nm)/ZnSiO2 (20 nm) is described along with results ob-
tained from experiments under various conditions. The smallest mark forma-
tion of 50 nm length owing to the optical pulses with a reduced duty ratio is
also presented.
Initialization eﬀect
To explain the super-RENS mechanism directly and clearly, the read/write
characteristics have been scrutinized experimentally. The conﬁguration for a
super-RENS optical disk using an AgOx mask layer is shown in Fig. 5.49. The
optical disk parameters and read/write conditions are shown in Table 5.7.

Fig. 5.50. Eﬀect of initialization laser power Pi on reproduced signals
Figure 5.50 shows the reproduced signals (normalized with as-depo level
Vi) at diﬀerent initializations of laser power Pi for an as-depo medium. The
reproduced signal Vi (mark) at the read power Pr = 1 mW changes in ways
such as the following: becomes small negative at Pi = 2.5 mW (a), becomes
maximum positive at Pi = 3.5mW (b), becomes nearly zero at Pi = 4mW
(c), and gradually increases to negative as Pi increases (d). This variation
generated by the written mark is shown in greater detail by the curve “mark”
in Fig. 5.51. This ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of initiallization on an as-depo medium
of the super-RENS disk. The mark reﬂectivity V2, normalized with as-depo
reﬂectivity Vi, changes from (a) a small negative to zero to (b) positive to
(c) zero to (d) increases to negative and then becomes saturated as the laser
power increases.
This phenomenon corresponds to (a) the little decrease in reﬂectivity due
to the little amorphous process in GeSbTe and then cancellation due to the
increase in refrectivity with the AgOx decomposition (Ag particle), (b) fully
decomposed Ag particles, (c) cancellation due tothe half amorphous process
of GeSbTe, (d) the decrease in reﬂectivity due to the completely amorphous

Fig. 5.52. Relationship between CNR of super-RENS readout (Pr = 4 mW) and
initialization laser power Pi, with mark length as parameter
process in GeSbTe. The maximum positive of the laser power of 3.5 mW shows
that the AgOx is fully decomposed to Ag particles and O2, both of which are
uniformly dispersed in the mask layer. On the other hand, the nonmark reﬂec-
tivity V2 remains constant because thermal interference due to the succcessive
laser pulses does not occur for long (3,000 nm) marks.
Figure 5.52 shows the relationship between the CNR for the super-RENS
readout (Pr = 4 mW) and the initialization laser power Pi, mark length as
a parameter. We deﬁne Pi = 3.5 mW as the initialization laser power where
the CNR for the short mark (under diﬀraction limit) reaches maximum. The
maximum CNR corresponds to a reproduced signal maximum at Pi = 3.5 mW
in Fig. 5.51, where fully decomposed Ag particles are dispersed in the mask
layer.
Figure 5.53 shows the eﬀect of initialization on the CNR for the super-
RENS readout, with write power Pw as a parameter. The CNR with initial-
ization (b) is higher and less dependent on Pw than that without initialization
(a). Moreover, we can detect a mark length of 200 nm (duty ratio 50%) because
with initialization the resolution increases.

Write power dependence
To determine the amorphous level of the recording layer, we measured write
power dependence of signal amplitude Vpp/Vi and the CNR for the initialized
medium. Here, Vpp = V1 −V2, and Vi is the as-depo level. They were mea-
sured for two conditions, immediately after writing (observed at Pr = 1 mW)
and at super-RENS readout (observed at Pr = 4 mW). We compared the
two signals and estimated the phase level (signal) and the noise level of the
medium.
Figure 5.54 shows the relationship between CNR, Vpp/Vi, and write power
Pw at the read power of Pr = 1mW. Figure 5.55 shows the relationship be-
tween CNR, Vpp/Vi, and write power Pw at Pr = 4mW mark length is a para-
meter. Figure 5.54 shows that a dip appears for every mark length. This phe-
nomenon occurs because reﬂectivity decreases as the half amorphous process
for middle Pw, but it increases as the Ag cluster process for high Pw. Then
the CNR becomes constant for high Pw. This suggests that the noise level
increases for high Pw because the reﬂectivity (signal level) was found to in-
crease with the completely amorphous process as Pw increases, as shown in
the lower ﬁgure. We also found that the signal remains constant between 5.5
and 7.5 mW for a long mark at Pr = 1 mW. This suggests that some changes
occurred in the mask layer between 5.5 and 7.5 mW.
In the case of the super-RENS readout (Pr = 4 mW), we found that every
dip disappars as shown in the upper ﬁgure of Fig. 5.55. Moreover, we found
that the the signal increases as Pw increases due to the completely amorphous
process, as shown in the lower ﬁgure. We conﬁrm that the constant signal level

Read power dependence
Figure 5.56 shows the read power Pr dependence on the CNR of the mark
written at the power of Pw = 8.5 mW, where mark length is a parameter.
From the ﬁgure, it is evident that signals (400–200 nm) appear beyond the
diﬀraction limit and the highest CNR of each mark length can be obtained at
Pr = 4 mW. On the other hand, CNRs are high and almost independent from
Pr for long marks (1,000–3,000 nm). All the signals disappear at read powers
greater than Pr = 6.5 mW because the amorphous mark and the bubble pit
are erased due to the continous large Pr. We deﬁne the optimum super-RENS
read power as 4 mW.
Figure 5.57 shows the read power dependence on the signal spectrum and
the amplitude for mark lengths of 1,000 nm (a), and 200 nm (b), where read

increase at Pr = 4 mW. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that noise increases at

Scattered type super-RENS working mechanism
On the basis of these results, we propose a model for an Ag-super-RENS mech-
anism. Figure 5.58 shows the states just after writing (Pr = 1 mW) for both
the mask layer and the recording layer, with write power Pw as a parameter.
The working mechanism for the Ag-super-RENS is as follows. Both the mask
and the recording layer have ﬁve possible states depending on the write power
Pw (a) as-depo, (b) Ag particles uniformly dispersed and crystallized (after
initialization Pw = 3.5 mW), (c) Ag cluster and half amorphous (Pw = 4–
5 mW), (d) Ag diﬀusion and completely amorphous (Pw = 5.5–7.5 mW), and
(e) Ag ring and bubble pit (greater than Pw = 8 mW). The mask layer for the
super-RENS readout (Pr = 4 mW) has an Ag ring structure, and the aperture
is ﬁlled with O2, which increases both the CNR and the resolution limit.
Optical pulse duty dependence
To realize a short mark length, we illuminated thermally isolated optical pulses
(having decreased duty ratio). Figure 5.59 shows the relationship between re-
ﬂectivity V1 (non-mark), V2 (mark), and mark length for the write power of
Pw = 8.5 mW with the super-RENS readout (Pr = 4 mW); the optical pulse
duty ratio as a parameter. The signal amplitude Vpp = V1 −V2 increases as
the duty ratio decreases, which means the amorphous level diﬀerence between
mark and nonmark increases because the diﬀerence in temperature increases
due to the longer time separation between the laser pulses. Figure 5.60 shows
the relationship between CNR and mark length for the super-RENS readout,
optical pulse duty ratio as a parameter (Pw = 8.5 mW). The reproduced signal

In summary, the scattered-type super-RENS using ZnSiO2/AgOx/ZnSiO2/
GeSbTe/ZnSiO2 has the following characteristics:
1. The mask layer and the recording layer have ﬁve possible states depending
on the write power Pw: as-depo, Ag particles uniformly dispersed and crys-
tallized (after initialization), Ag cluster and half amorphous, Ag diﬀusion
and completely amorphous, and Ag ring and bubble pit.
2. The mask layer for the super-RENS readout has an Ag ring structure,
and the aperture is ﬁlled with O2, which increases both the CNR and the

Problems
5.1. How is the force F = 2kT/d (due to Brownian motion) dependence on
the diameter d of a microsphere? The microsphere is suspended in water,
where k is the Boltzman constant, and T is 298 K.

tenuated total reﬂection at the prism (refractive index 1.6) to air interface.
A plane wave with a wavelength of 800 nm is incident at an angle of 45◦and
the induced evanescent ﬁeld is scattered by the sharpened metal probe of the
curvature of 20 nm, where the distance between the probe tip and the prism
surface is 15 nm.

A1.1 There are several aspects in comparing the fabrication methods for
microstructures: productivity, thickness, structure, and material used. Pho-
tolithography and LIGA will be used for mass production, but photoforming
will be used for small-scale production and also for fabricating a complicated
3-D structure. An EBL, which has high resolution and does not require masks,
will be used for fabricating microstructures less than 1 µm thick. Photolitho-
graphy will be used for fabricating microstructures less than several 10 µm,
and LIGA less than several 100 µm. The latter two require the use of masks
for the etching. Groups III–V compound materials are used to integrate an
LD and a PD.
A1.2 A sacriﬁced layer is the layer that is etched away, whereby the
microstructure is undercut, leaving it freely suspended (see Sect. 1.2.1).
A1.3 Friction-less and contact sticking-free structures are needed for optical
MEMS because of the increase of the surface eﬀect. Refer to the scaling law
(see Sect. 1.3.1).
A1.4 The moment of inertia of the mirror is I1 = ρab3t/12.I2 with a 50%
reduction in the dimensions is I2/I1 = (0.5)(0.5)3(0.5) = 3.1%.
A1.5 Response time is proportional to [mass/frictional force], i.e., [L3/L2] =
[L], which leads to faster response as L decreases.
A1.6 See Sect. 1.5.

A2.4 There will be two ideas: one is a ﬁne microactuator, such as a PZT, on
the slider or on the arm of the main actuator. An electric actuator, such as
a laser beam deﬂector, will be preferable to a mechanical actuator, such as a
PZT.
A2.5 A 1.3-µm long-wavelength InGaAsP LD is used because it is stable and
oxidation-free in air and its spot diameter (near ﬁeld) is mainly constrained
by the shape of the ridged waveguide. The oxidation-free characteristics are
very important, especially when the LD is used at a high power output for
thermal writing.

A3.1 See Fig. 3.2 and Table 3.1 in Sect. 3.1.
A3.2 Consult the following procedure:
1. decompose the beam into individual rays with appropriate intensity and
direction
2. trace individual rays
3. ﬁnd the angle θ1(r, β) incident to the microsphere of a ray entering the
objective lens aperture at an arbitrary point (r, β)
4. compute the Fresnel transmission T and reﬂection R coeﬃcients at the
incident point
5. compute the trapping eﬃciencies Qs(r) and Qg(r), for that ray
6. integrate the contribution of all rays within the convergent angle
7. compute total trapping eﬃciency using Qt =

Q2s + Q2g
A3.3 See Fig. 3.15.
A3.4 First, we ﬁnd the incident angle θ1(r, β) of a ray entering the aperture
of the objective lens at an arbitrary point (r, β) as shown in Fig. 3.12a. The
ray makes an angle α to the xy plane and also makes an angle γ to the y-axis
as shown in Fig. 3.12b. Then the angles become
α = tan−1
Rm
r
cot Φm

,
γ = cos−1(cos α cos β).
Since r0 sin θ1(r, β) = s sin(γ), then the incident angle becomes
θ1(r, β) = sin−1(s sin(tan−1
Rm
r
cot Φm

cos β),
where Rm is the radius of the objective lens, Φm is the maximum convergent
angle, s is the distance from the laser focus to the center of the microsphere.
Next, the trapping eﬃciencies Qs(r) and Qg(r) are computed by the vector
sum of the contributions of all rays within the convergent angle in the same
manner described in Example 3.4. See Fig. 3.13b.
