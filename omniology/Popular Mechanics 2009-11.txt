 tool comparisons   we know that picking the 
right tool for the job means finding the best, 
toughest and most appropriate designs for a given 
diy task. That’s why we round up the newest

The soul of scout 
Thank you for the chill that ran 
down my spine when I read Roy 
berendsohn’s story, “To build a 
boat.” My father always loved 
boats. He loved to build them, 
own them, sell them and pilot 
them. I once asked why he had 
such an obsession, and he told 
me about a rowboat he’d built 
from plans in PoPular Mechanics. 
I never, in a million years, 
thought that I would see the 
boat he described. but when I 
saw the photo of the May 1937 
issue’s “building the biloxi 
Dinghy,” there it was! now I 
understand why the first boat 
he ever owned as an adult was 
named Sea Scout. Thanks for 
the connection with my dad— 
I almost felt like I was there, 
holding a piece of wood in 
place, watching as he carefully 
checked to make sure it fit.

The Massive Ordnance  
Penetrator is designed to 
destroy deeply buried bunkers or 
hardened facilities. With a weight  
of 30,000 pounds (including nearly  
3 tons of explosives), the precision-
guided weapon would be the  
biggest conventional bomb the 
United States has ever fielded.  
The Air Force is asking for funds to 
accelerate the development of the 
weapon, so that MOP could be 
available for use by July.

continuing to 
operate the

Muscles atrophy in the absence of gravity, posing a 
sizeable problem for future astronauts on a yearlong 
mission to Mars. However, recent studies indicate 
that an hour a day on an onboard centrifuge could 
mitigate the problem. NASA-supported researchers 
at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galves-
ton confined 15 volunteers to zero-gravity-simulating 
bed rest for three weeks. Eight of them were spun 
60 minutes a day in a centrifuge and maintained 
normal rates of protein synthesis 
in their thigh muscles, while rates 
for the bed-ridden, no-spin group 
dropped by almost half. Life 
science researchers in Galveston 
are seeking the right mix of food 
supplements, exercise and

Earlier this year, throngs of professional astronomers scrambled to 
secure time on the world’s largest telescopes after an amateur 
skywatcher discovered a new scar on Jupiter’s surface, the result of an 
unexpected cosmic collision. Scientists don’t like these kinds of surprises, 
even if the event occurred far from Earth. “We like to know where these 
things are, from a planetary protection standpoint,” says Mark Gurwell at 
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. More troubling, our 
planetary surveillance appears to be lagging: A recent National Academy of 
Sciences report says that NASA’s effort to catalogue dangerous near-Earth 
objects does not have the funding to be finished by its deadline in 2020.

was there 
an impact?
How big 
was the 
impactor? 
what else 
does the scar 
indicate? 
what was 
the impactor 
made of? 
→ Leigh Fletcher’s team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab 
confirmed that the spot on Jupiter was an impact site by 
imaging it in infrared light, which showed reflective aerosols and 
ammonia had been blasted high into the atmosphere. Ir imagery 
also revealed that the spot is hotter than its surroundings.
→ The collision left only one scar, meaning whatever hit Jupiter 
didn’t break up before impact. The size of the spot tells 
scientists that the impactor could have been a maximum of 
1640 feet in diameter, too small to see from earth.
→ Despite its small size, the July impactor created a debris 
field of scattered gases the size of earth. Debris forms a 
substantial part of the ring seen around the impact site, but 
researchers are debating the direction of the impactor’s 
approach based on the scattering of the debris plume. 
→ most objects roaming the outer solar system are rock–ice 
balls, like comets. Astronomers are using spectroscopic analysis 
to examine the chemicals near the scar. Finding traces of water 
or oxygen would confirm that an icy body, and not a rocky 
asteroid, struck Jupiter.  
Secrets of 
Napoleon’s 
Cannons 
Historians have turned to 
violence to recreate the 
last moments of a 
210-year-old warship 
that sank outside Acre in 
northern israel. Archae-
ologists long believed it 
was a British vessel sunk 
during Napoleon’s siege 
of the port in 1799, but 
wondered whether 
cannonballs found 
among the wreckage 
could have penetrated 
the ship’s unusually thick 
oak hull. to solve the 
mystery, researchers 
from the university of 
Haifa this year built five 
50 percent scale models 
of the hull, then pelted 
them with steel balls at 
speeds as slow as 200 
mph and as fast as 
1000 mph—a range of 
velocities similar to that 
of the cannon fire of the 
era. The mock cannon-
balls penetrated the hulls 
at every speed. Surpris-
ingly, the lowest speeds 
were found to pose the 
highest risk for sailors, 
because the wood 
absorbed more energy, 
which created deadly, 
splintery shrapnel.

Radiation treatments 
for cancer are 
double-edged swords: They 
indiscriminately destroy 
healthy tissue along with 
cancer cells, causing 
debilitating side effects. To 
target cancer cells alone, 
the University of Pennsylva-
nia is opening a next-
 generation treatment 
facility that uses high-
 energy proton beams to 
deliver pinpoint strikes.
Penn’s $144 million 
Roberts Proton Therapy 
Center will use magnets to

accelerate protons to near 
light speed in a 220-ton 
cyclotron. The beam lines 
direct the proton beams 
into treatment rooms 
where patients will have 
their tumors zapped. 
nozzles on the ends of 
90-ton gantries, aided by 
the CT, MRi and PET 
imaging equipment, aim 
the beams. The proton 
beam works like any other 
form of ionizing radiation, 
which destroys cancer cell 
Dna and prevents 
replication. “The difference 
is all in the physical 
characteristics of the beam 
itself,” explains James 
Metz, chief of clinical opera-
tions of the new facility. “a 
regular X-ray goes in one 
side of the body and out 
the other side and 
irradiates everything in 
between.” but unlike the 
massless photons that 
compose X-rays, protons 
are heavy particles that 
enter the body without 
much scattering, so they 
can be aimed with 
precision. They also 
continue in a straight line 
as they slow, releasing 
radioactive energy at a 
location determined by the 
beam’s energy. “What that 
means for the patient is a 
much lower dose in front of 
the tumor and absolutely 
no radiation behind the 
tumor,” Metz says. 
The Roberts Center has 
announced partnerships 
with the Children’s Hospital 
of Philadelphia, Walter 
Reed army Medical Center 
and bethesda’s national 
naval Medical Center to 
increase access to the 
expensive treatment 
offered by the new facility. 
How It Works 
Step 1
CyClotron
The magnet-
packed particle 
accelerator weighs 
220 tons but is 
only 18 feet wide 
and 8 feet high.
Step 2
Beam line
Protons moving at 
almost the speed 
of light are 
deflected and 
focused by 
magnets along the 
line. The beam 
lines are kept in a 
vacuum so that 
the particles don© t 
slow down. The 
line branches to up 
to five separate 
treatment rooms.  
Step 3
Gantries
These 90-ton 
machines aim the 
proton beam at 
the patient’s 
body; the 
relatively heavy 
particles slow 
down when they 
encounter body 
tissue. When they 
move more slowly 
they interact with 
atoms in the body, 
producing ionizing 
radiation. Doctors 
can adjust the 
strength of the 
beam to cause the 
protons to 
produce radiation 
only at the 
tumor’s location.

[ The shank ]
This custom-made, 
diamond- 
encrusted bit 
begins as a 
standard half-inch 
raw carbide 
blank—the same 
kind companies 
turn into 
woodworking 
router bits. 
[ The fluTes ]
Flutes channel-cut 
carbon fiber away 
from the overlap 
(see below). since 
carbon fiber is 
formed in layers, 
the bit has to clear 
a lot of recently 
decompressed 
material out of the 
way to keep the 
cutting surfaces 
unclogged.
[ The overlap ]
The point where 
the flutes switch 
directions, known 
as the overlap, 
makes the cut 
along the carbon 
fiber. as the 
overlap cuts,  
the flutes of the bit 
push the material 
toward the overlap 
in opposing 
directions, and  
this compressed 
cut creates a  
clean edge. 
[ The Tip ] 
diamonds are 
bonded to the bit 
by growing them  
in microscopic 
pores on the bit’s 
surface along the 
two cutting edges 
of each of six 
flutes. unlike 
traditional dipped 
coatings, this 
homegrown ice 
has a longer life.
Composite carbon fiber is at the 
foundation of some of aviation’s most 
advanced projects, including the  
F-35 Lightning II airplane. The material, 
which is lighter and stronger than metal, 
requires a new class of tools to shape it. 
When engineers machine parts for a 
stealth airplane, each piece has to fit 
perfectly. however, the edges of carbon-
composite shapes suffer from 
delamination when their tightly pressed 
layers separate after being cut. This 
star-shaped router bit, built by South 
Carolina’s aMaMCo tool, is designed to 
prevent delamination.

 an international team of 
 scientists has found 
 hundreds of methane gas 
 plumes in the depths of the 
 arctic ocean.  german and 
english researchers used 
sonar to detect 250 columns 
of bubbles pushing out of the 
seabed of West spitsbergen 
and then sampled the water 
in those areas, finding that 
the gas was predominantly 
methane. The discovery 
indicates there may be more 
of the gas being released and 
from deeper areas of the 
arctic seabed than expected. 
in a recent paper in Geophys-
ical research Letters, the 
researchers attribute the 
seeps to the warming of 
northward-flowing currents, 
making this the first time 
increased methane leaks can 
be attributed to global 
warming. icelike methane 
hydrate is trapped in the 
seabed, but the gas is 
released as the sediment 
thaws. The u.s. department 
of energy says there is more 
potential energy in methane 
trapped on the seafloor than 
in all the world’s other fossil 
fuels combined. The majority 
of methane currently 
released from ocean 
seabeds is dissolved in the 
seawater before it reaches 
the atmosphere, preventing 
the greenhouse gas from 
reaching the atmosphere,  
but intensifying the  
water’s acidification.

U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan load into convoys of mine-
 resistant, ambush-protected vehicles called MRAPs to protect themselves 
from improvised explosive devices. But the family of MRAPs they are riding in were 
produced for conditions in Iraq. In Afghanistan, roads are a rare luxury, and MRAP 
suspensions often break while being driven across the rocky terrain. In response, 
the Pentagon is now spending more than $3 billion on 5200 MRAP all-terrain 
vehicles (M-ATVs) that are designed for off-road missions in Afghanistan. The 
Pentagon’s contracts with Oshkosh Corp. specify that the company deliver all the 
M-ATVs by March, but the first are expected in theater next month. 
The Oshkosh team started thinking of ways to adapt an existing product to

compete for the contract in december 2008, shortly after the Pentagon issued an 
emergency call for the vehicles. The company adapted an existing 7-ton truck used 
by the Marine Corps by removing an axle from the chassis of the six-wheeled 
vehicle. (Pentagon officials are always interested in systems that share common 
parts, even across services, to simplify logistics.) Oshkosh’s M-ATV shares other 
features with the 7-ton truck, including the drivetrain, dashboard and coil-spring 
suspension, which can clear 16 inches while the M-ATV is carrying a normal load. 
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have ended the nearly 30-year career of the 
humvee, which was created to move troops and material through safe terrain 
behind friendly lines. A competition to replace every service’s humvee with a 
better armored Joint light Tactical Vehicle has already begun, with a showdown 
between the final two contenders expected in 2011.

Suspension:

independent

can clear  
16 inches with 
a normal load.
Armor: 
bolt-on armor kits 
can be swapped 
out depending on 
the mission, and 
damaged vehicles 
can be more easily 
repaired on bases 
instead of being 
shipped home. 
Interior: 
The seats are 
suspended from 
the ceiling with 
straps, instead of 
being bolted to the 
floor, so that 
explosive energy 
doesn’t travel into 
the cab as easily. 
The floor-mat 
material—Oshkosh 
won’t disclose 
what it’s made 
of—also soaks up 
blast energy. 
V-Shaped Hull: 
The angled 
underside deflects 
the force of 
explosions away 
from the 
occupants.
Wheel Rims: 
The rims can 
survive if the 
wheels are blasted 
away, at least long 
enough to escape 
the kill zone of an 
ambush. Drivers 
can change the 
inflation of the 
tires from behind 
the wheel for on- 
or off-road 
conditions and for 
load weight.

  apple has a sly habit of waiting for nascent product categories 
to blossom, and then moving in and taking over. Up next on its hit 
list: Flip-style pocket camcorders. Like the new iPhone 3gS, the 
updated Apple iPod Nano ($150 for 8 GB, $180 for 16 GB) adds 
a video camera to the enormously popular player, and it does it 
without a price or size premium over previous models. Still, the 
product can be viewed as a sort of stay of execution for camcorder 
competitors: It doesn’t shoot in hi-def, and apple still hasn’t built a 
video camera into its more powerful, convergence-oriented iPod 
touch. but both are surely coming.  — Seth PorgeS

 movie-based 
video games are 
notorious for being 
lazy, quickly 
slapped-together 
programs designed 
with little ambition 
beyond cashing  
in on a movie’s  
hype. Avatar: The 
Game ($60) is an 
exception—Ubisoft 
spent two full years 
poring over the 
James Cameron 
movie’s design and 
aesthetics, from 
within the bowels of 
a top-secret bunker 
in montreal. The 
coolest part: Like 
the movie, the Xbox 
360 and PS3 
versions can be 
played in fourth-
wall-busting 3D. 
That is, of course, 
assuming you’ve  
got a 3D-capable  
Tv (a large number 
of new plasma  
and DLP sets fit  
this bill).

 On the outside, it’s 
hard to tell the differ-
ence between the new   
 Bose QuietComfort 15  
 ($300)  noise-canceling 
headphones and the 
QuietComfort 2s they 
replace. But swap the 
old and new pairs while 
sitting next to speakers 
pumping 95 dB of 
jet-engine sounds, like 
we did, and you’ll notice 
the difference. The new 
headphones simply do a 
far more effective job of 
quieting the ambient 
annoyance to an almost 
inaudible hum.
3d  
camera
 3D may be making a comeback, 
but there are things about it that most 
of us take for granted: Shooting it is 
strictly for big-budget directors, and 
we need to wear glasses to view it. 
The Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W1, 
coming to Europe and Asia this fall 
(and to the U.S. soon after) for about 
$600, does away with both of these 
assumptions. It’s a pocket-size camera 
that uses two stereoscopic lenses to 
shoot 3D photos and videos. The 
product’s usefulness is admittedly 
limited—the 3D footage can only be 
seen on the camera’s 2.8-inch LCD or 
on an 8-inch “3D viewer” accessory, 
both of which can display 3D without 
 glasses—but it could portend a future 
where consumers can shoot 3D 
footage as easily as they shoot video 
with a Flip cam or an iPhone today.

The iconic vise-Grip locking pliers 
quite literally aren’t what they used to 
be—in 2008, six years after purchasing 
the brand from Petersen manufactur-
ing, Irwin Tools’ parent company newell 
rubbermaid shuttered the nebraska 
vise-Grip factory and moved production 
to China. So we wondered: How do the 
new outsourced vise-Grips hold up to 
the nebraska classics (which are no 
longer stocked in stores, but are sure to 
be found in lots of toolboxes). We put 
both, along with a pair of discount 
buyer’s value brand locking pliers, to 
the test.  by harry sawyers

hand strength just to

IrwIn VIse-GrIP:  
Like the Petersen

took 12 squeezes to pinch 
the pipe shut. but thanks 
to the cushioned grip, it 
felt like less.

topped at both ends by a rotating quiver of eight 
different sockets. The differences between the two 
tools are minute: The B&D has cushioned grips and 
clearer markings, while the Craftsman has a magnet to 
hold loose nuts. So how did the dueling doppelgängers 
make their simultaneous debut? Black & Decker claims 
to have developed the tool in-house, insinuating that a 
rogue ex-employee or loose-lipped tool buyer spilled the 
beans. Craftsman acknowledges the proposal came to 
them from an outside toolmaker. But the truth is that 
neither company’s idea is original—the first Dog Bone, 
a dead ringer for the new one, was a Craftsman tool 
from 40 years ago. It’s a clever design. But then, as 
now, we would’ve preferred slender, ratcheting sockets.

The new LaCrosse is evidence that Buick is bouncing back—as soon 
as we pressed the throttle, this car impressed. The 255-hp 3.0-liter V6 
(a 3.6-liter V6 is optional, as is a four-cylinder that returns 30 mpg 
highway) smoothly hummed as it revved. But you hear just a hint of 
growl, which makes exercising this engine rewarding. In manual mode, 
the engine will bounce off the 7000-rpm rev limiter—not automatically 
upshift like some luxury cars. Part of the credit for the powertrain’s 
refinement is the solid structure it’s bolted to. There’s a higher 
percentage of high-strength steel here than on any other GM product. 
Road impacts are barely audible, with none of the heaves and bobs 
that used to plague Buicks. Inside, the materials are one big notch 
above the usual GM decor, with a huge rear seat and a comfortable 
backrest. The best Buick in decades? Could be.  — Larry Webster

Trail blazer 
The 1995 Subaru Outback was 
arguably the world’s first crossover. And 
Subaru carries those rugged traditions 
forward to the new outback. The 
redesigned Subaru is larger, and 
provides 4 more inches of rear legroom 
than before—a substantial gain. The 
base 170-hp 2.5-liter flat Four is paired 
to a six-speed manual or a CvT. Step up 
to the 3.6-liter flat Six and 256 hp flows 
through a five-speed automatic. of 
course, opting for the Six brings more 
thrust. but the gain in performance 
doesn’t seem to be worth the expense, 
considering how brilliantly the Four 
works with the CvT. As with all Subarus, 
all-wheel drive is standard, and the 
outback is a solid scrambler along dirt 
roads and up some pretty difficult trails. 
It’s no Jeep Wrangler, but when you 
absolutely, positively must get to the ski 
mountain, this $22,995 Subaru is more 
than capable.  — john pearley huffman

Structural Integrity 
Early on, Nissan made a crucial 
decision to design the 370Z roadster 
at the same time as the Coupe. As a 
result, many of the car’s structural 
members are modular, able to accept 
either a lighter part for the Coupe or a 
stronger subassembly for the roadster. 
That means this convertible is 150 
pounds lighter and much stiffer than 
the last Z roadster. even with our 
$40,490 Z’s Sport package (which 
adds 19-inch wheels, a viscous 
limited-slip and better brakes), the 
structure felt commendably tight. 
nissan aimed to match the Porsche 
boxster’s degree of cabin comfort with 
the top down—the result is a placid 
environment. As speeds increase out in 
the wild, the Z acquires a fluid poise. 
The v6 spins to 7500 rpm before 
driving its tach needle into the red zone, 
and that provides long stretches of 
thrust in every gear. The interior is lined 
with soft-touch moldings, suede 
textures and exclusive seats. Speed 
and comfort? Sold.  — barry winfield

drove the Cruze on a horrible collection 
of broken surfaces, and it handled well. 
The Cruze is powered by a 1.8-liter 
gasoline four-cylinder or a diesel. The 
1.8-liter Cruze weighs 2882 pounds, and 
it rides and points into corners with 
more alacrity than the heavier diesel. 
Chevy won’t offer the diesel in the U.S., 
but we will receive a 1.4-liter turbo-
charged Four that is said to deliver 
around 40 mpg highway. Inside, the fit 
and finish indicate a notch above the 
class. The seat stitching is perfect, and 
the four-dial instrument binnacle is easy 
to read. If it weren’t for the noisy ride 
and rather inert steering, the Cruze could 
take a bite out of more expensive rivals. 
But we’ll wait for a U.S.-spec drive for 
our final judgment.  — Andrew english 
Civic Duty 
The $15,000 Koup is a slick spinoff 
of Kia’s Forte sedan, with a lean, 
purposeful look that says the company 
is serious about sportiness. The EX has 
a 156-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but the 
SX is equipped with a 173-hp 2.4-liter 
and delivers 32 mpg highway. The 
Koup’s suspension uses a thicker sway 
bar, tighter steering ratio and stiffer 
shocks than the sedan, while the SX 
version has slightly more aggressive 
tuning. So the Koup corners like a real 
sport compact. The ride is comfortable, 
but pothole jolts are fairly severe. The 
2.4-liter makes the Koup feel lively—
especially at higher rpm. And 70 mph 
translates to a mere 2200 rpm, so 
real-world economy should be excellent. 
Kia is new to the sport coupe scene, yet 
here it has built a cool, competent Civic 
Coupe competitor for less dough. 
Kudos to Kia.  — BAsem wAsef

Cadillac’s direct-injected 
3.0-liter V6 is a modern, 
smooth and efficient 
engine with a class-
competitive 265 hp 
good enough for many 
but with less oomph 
than some luxury 
crossovers. Bring on the 
new turbo option. 
Though the smallest 
engine in the Cadillac 
range, the 2.8-liter V6’s 
turbo provides 300 hp 
and, crucially, 295 lb-ft of 
torque at a mere 2000 
rpm. We sampled the 
SrX 2.8T on the road 
course at GM’s Milford 
Proving Ground and on 
nearby public roads. We 
drove it back-to-back 
with the 3.0-liter model 
at the track, and the 
difference is noticeable—
the turbo really hauls. 
Expect to pay for that 
power, though; fully 
loaded SrX models will 
touch $55,000.

Summer Fling 
The Fiat 500 minicar will 
likely be the first “italian 
job” Chrysler offers in 
the u.S. for 2011. But it 
would be difficult to 
imagine this charming 
convertible version 
failing to make the cut 
too. The 500C’s top is 
electrically powered and 
can be partially 
retracted as a small 
sunroof, rolled further 
back as a full-length 
sunroof or furled down 
on top of the trunk in 
complete alfresco mode. 
The cabin is impressively 
calm with the roof 
down. The 1.4-liter 
model is brisker than  
a stopwatch might 
indicate. And there’s 
enough torque to  
ensure you don’t have to 
row the car along with 
the gear lever. This 
37-mpg funster is so 
lovable that it’s hard  
to wipe the smile off 
your face.  — A.e.
Track Worthy
BMW’s storied M division has 
stepped up to what is, quite literally, its 
biggest challenge ever: creating a 
high-performance 5324-pound X6. rest 
assured, the 555-hp V8, sublime 
suspension and massive tires do their 
best to make the $89,725 X6 m 
perform. given a little space in traffic, or 
the need to pass, the stout engine 
pushes you way back into the seat. 
There’s also a deep exhaust note, 
appreciably crisper when the driver 
selects Sport mode. Cut it loose on the 
sweeping turns, hilly terrain and long 
straights of the track at road Atlanta, 
though, and the X6 m responds like the 
hot machine it is. On the long series of 
open curves and the straight coming 
down the hill, we saw an indicated 135 
mph before needing to brake hard for 
the ensuing left-hand, 90-degree turn. 
Whew, this is one quick truck.  — K.w. 
Sensible Speed 
Piloting a $61,900 lotus elise SC 
the way it was intended to be driven—
that is, maximizing the lilliputian 
roadster’s natural-born nimbleness by 
dancing around corners and sweeping 
the tachometer up to 8500 rpm—is fun. 
But could this peppy plaything have a 
sensible side too? We decided to 
stretch every ounce of fuel from the 
car’s 10.6-gallon tank that we could, 
maximizing mileage. We accumulated 
500 miles of mild-mannered driving and 
short-shifting, avoiding the fuel-sucking 
tendencies of the supercharger, with 
surprisingly efficient results. Sixty mph 
translates to 2750 rpm, making the 
elise SC feel perfectly content trundling 
along on the highway. On one long-
distance run from los Angeles to la 
Jolla, we coaxed 31.7 mpg from the 
lotus—our best results of the test.  
The golden age of horsepower may be 
waning, but cars like the lotus elise 
prove there’s no reason speed and 
efficiency can’t happily coexist.

The Kizashi is 
intended to bring 
European dynamics 
to a segment 
bristling with 
competent 
rivals—including  
the Honda Accord 
and Toyota Camry. 
The sedan will arrive 
with either a 2.4-liter

3.2-liter V6 and has 
optional all-wheel 
drive. High-speed 
calibrations were 
dialed in at the

top M56 model 
(which  replaces the

The new Fat Boy Lo bears a heavier, 
low-slung stance consistent with its 
moniker. This model has the shortest 
seat height (24.25 inches) of any 
Harley-Davidson, thanks to a suspen-

Available only in glossy or matte black, 
the Fat Boy Lo’s appearance is mean, 
but riders will find its predictable 
acceleration and accommodating 
ergonomics welcoming.  — Basem Wasef

the meteoric rise and precipitous 
fall of the suv in mainstream popu-
larity could mean that americans will 
return to their vehicular roots: the sta-
tion wagon. For decades, it was the 
station wagon that was charged with 
the humble task of hauling the family. 
The trend may be back, with an edge. 
sport wagons offer brisk perfor-
mance, smooth looks and, yes, plenty 
of room for stuff too. even cadil-
lac is preparing an entry. yet no car 
typifies this breed better than audi’s 
a4 avant. the latest a4, all new for 
2009, shares much of its chassis with 
the sporting a5 coupe, so deft han-
dling comes naturally. but under the 
hood is the real news: a 2.0-liter four-
cylinder with more torque than many 
v6s—including audi’s own 3.2-liter 
v6. so, we decided to add one very 
hip, very black and very cool a4 avant 
to our long-term fleet. Fully loaded, an 
a4 can creep well north of $50,000.

Our Ram was recently tasked with moving a houseful of furniture and the 
entire saturday mechanic shop into our new digs, a job it handled with alacrity and 
competence. The rear seats fold out of the way, leaving a padded cavern for fragile 
things that absolutely, positively can’t get wet. Though the 5-foot-7-inch-long 
cargo box is far from a work truck’s full 8-foot-long bed, it has been adequate for 
loading long couches. The integrated cargo tie downs, which slide along rails inside 
the box, make it easy to keep stuff inside the bed, even when the tailgate is down. 
and those supremely comfortable power seats make work seem less so. They had 
better be, considering this truck stickers for over 50 large. The backup camera is 
especially handy when maneuvering into a loading dock with the cab and bed full 
to the roofline. our only grumble? The cheap plastic trim on top of the tailgate said 
adios after just three loads. we recommend upgrading to a metal one just as shiny 
as the ram’s grille and bumpers.  — MIKE ALLEN

for the past 2100 miles the jetta 
has served as our L.a. runabout— 
crossing from the east side of town to 
the west almost daily. and like many 
angelenos, we’ve avoided the freeways. 
That means our fuel economy has 
suffered somewhat. but salvation came 
in the form of our annual pilgrimage to 
the pebble beach concours d’elegance, 
the most prestigious and highfalutin car 
show weekend in the country. what 
better car to take to this showcase of 
million-dollar metal than our snow white 
jetta diesel? our colleague arrived at the 
posh hotel on the monterey peninsula in 
a bold, snorting sports coupe. The valet 
ignored him and instead asked us what 
kind of mileage our jetta delivered.  
The trip from L.a. to monterey returned  
40 mpg, we said. he nodded in approval. 
So, as much as we may have 
wanted the Drive Select system 
($2950) and Adaptive Cruise

choose the navigation system

the second-row seats are folded 
flat. As an SUV alternative, does 
the Avant make the cut? Over

our subaru has been in high demand 
by Pm staffers recently, thanks to its 
spunky dynamics and generous cargo 
capacity. Since our last report we’ve 
hauled a dresser from Pennsylvania to 
new York, thrown bicycles in the back 
to escape for a day of riding and packed 
it tight with camping supplies for numer-
ous weekend trips. Unfortunately, the 
last 5000 miles haven’t taught us to 
love the Subaru’s display and navigation 
system. on a 450-mile haul to north 
Carolina, the rays peeking through the 
sunroof rendered the screen completely 
useless. And a couple of questionable 
nav-system routings taught us to keep 
our road atlas within reach. but our 
enchantment with the Forester will 
linger long after it leaves the fleet. Far 
too often we’ve caught ourselves 
pushing the XT’s powerful turbo motor 
hard on the open road. Loaded with five 
people and their gear, the engine 
showed no sign of strain. And as if 
reminding us it’s bred from the same 
stock as the WrX, the Forester had no 
trouble outmaneuvering taxis and 
behemoth buses on crowded streets. 
We hope to cross paths with the 
Forester again soon.  — EMILY MASAMITSU

new one? It would be great if I could 
run a turbine car on biodiesel, espe-
cially a nonfood-sourced fuel. So I sat 
down with Steve Anderson and Frank 
Saucedo from General Motors’ 
Advanced Design Studios and told 
them what I had in mind. I’m not a 
designer, so I couldn’t really convey 
what I was looking for; they had to 
give me some ideas. They’d sketch 
Jay’s sleek EcoJet turbine supercar was inspired by the 2002 Cadillac Cien show car, as 
well as by GM’s 1950s Firebird jet cars designed by legend Harley Earl. 
hen I was a kid, jet-powered cars 
seemed like the future. I watched The 
Jetsons on TV, and they’d get in their jet 
car, fire it up and zip away. I read about 
the Rover-BRM gas turbine car in the 
’60s, and I went to the New York 
World’s Fair in 1964 to see Chrysler’s 
own spin around and around on the 
stand. I’ve always been a big fan of 
these cars. And recently, I was able to 
buy one of the nine original turbine 
cars from Chrysler. Owning it has been 
the thrill of a lifetime. Even though my 
1963 Chrysler turbine car was built 
45 years ago, to this day, when I’m driv-
ing it, people say, “Ooooh, look how 
smooth that car is!”
So I thought, why not try to build a

the nav and audio

can use the Internet 
as well as send and 
receive e-mails from 
the EcoJet’s front

is parked, of course.

something and ask, “Is this it?” I’d say 
noooo, and then they’d offer another 
design: “How about this?” I remem-
ber Ed Welburn, GM’s VP of global 
design, was at one of our meetings, 
sketching on cocktail napkins. I men-
tioned that I liked the look of the 
Cadillac Cien show car. The GM 
design team kept sketching. I knew 
I’d know the right design as soon as I 
saw it. And I did. 
We decided to call the car the Eco-
Jet, and it was one serious project. My 
chief mechanic, Bernard Juchli, along 
with fabricator Jim Hall and the rest of 
the guys in the shop, did a wonderful 
job building it. Metalcrafters, the com-
pany that builds many of the concept 
cars at auto shows, constructed the 
carbon-fiber-over-Kevlar body. The 
chassis was basically built in-house at 
my garage. Alcoa provided technical 
support for the hydro-formed frame 
rails, aluminum space frame, the sub-
frame structures and the turbine-
blade-inspired forged alloy wheels. 
Each one of those wheels was made 
from a 400-pound billet of aluminum. 
In keeping with this car’s environ-
mentally friendly theme, we didn’t 
want to use any animal-sourced prod-
ucts. Instead, the interior is crafted 
from materials that can be recycled, 
like Alcantara, a man-made suede.  
We used as many GM components 
as we could, like the Brembo carbon-
fiber brakes—the same ones used in 
the Corvette ZR1. The suspension 
arms come from a Z06 C6 Corvette, as 
do the heavily modified frame rails. 
The turbine itself is a Honeywell 
LTS-101, like the ones used in Bell 222 
and U.S. Coast Guard Dolphin heli-
copters. It puts out 650 hp and 583 
lb-ft of torque. A four-speed auto-
matic transaxle was adapted from a 
C5 Corvette. We had to use an auto-
matic because the turbine requires a 
constant load. A manual would cause 
the turbine to overspeed—like push-
j a y  l e n o ’ s  g a r a g e / / / 
t u r b i n e  c a r
ing in the clutch on a car with the 
engine redlined. 
Because the jet runs at 60 percent 
of its maximum 40,000 rpm at idle, the 
output shaft speed translates to 3300 
rpm. So we asked Hot Flush to engi-
neer us a custom torque converter with 
a stall speed of 3500 rpm—just above 
the turbine’s idle. But here’s the fun 
part. In order to reduce the overall 
length of the car, we stacked the 
engine on top of the transmission. 
Weismann, the same talented guys 
that built the transaxle for the McLaren 
F1, constructed a 1:1 transfer gearbox 
that drops the output shaft of the 
engine 6 inches, reverses rotation and 
sends the power back to the torque 
converter, not unlike a V-drive in a 
boat. And these guys are right here in 
California. (Southern California is still 
the hot-rodding capital of the world.) 
When the EcoJet  was finished, we 
raced a jet plane on an 
airport runway, and 
we beat ’em up to 160 
mph. Speed’s not a 
problem for this car; 
it’s geared to do 245 
mph. The turbine 
needs to spool up to 
generate power, so 
there’s a noticeable 
lag before it picks up 
speed. You put your foot 
on the brake, bring up the 
revs, then accelerate. As with 
any jet engine, all that power is up at 
the top end of the range. It’s a lot of 
fun to drive on the street and it’s 
extremely smooth. But this car is very 
noisy, and that racket comes mostly 
from the air intake. Chrysler’s engi-
neers were geniuses back in the ’60s. 
Their turbine is reasonably quiet 
because they wanted people to hear 
that jet engine sound—whirrrrr! We’re 
working with K&N and Flowmaster to 
seal the intake better and develop a fil-

it goes kercluuunnk—so we’ll find a 
quieter switch. But the really tough 
part is done. It’s on the road now, 
and it doesn’t overheat. The trans-
mission fluid stays very cool, and 
the car runs smoothly. 
I like that the EcoJet is a usable 
vehicle that looks like a car of the 
future. There’s a Batmobile quality 
to it. You get the feeling you’re on 
your way to fight crime when you 
get into it. But that concept car look 
is balanced with practicality. It’s 
not one of those “You could never 
drive that; look where the head-
lights are!” kind of cars.
Okay, so there’s no trunk. You 
wouldn’t want to take it on a trip. 
Since I don’t play golf, I don’t really 
care about room for a golf bag. 
There’s about the same amount of 
storage space as there is in an Audi 
R8. You can carry an insurance card 
and one pack of M&M’s.
That’s enough for me.

this is a jet. 
When the original Chrysler tur-

to go to a truck stop to fill up with 
diesel, or use home heating oil. 
But the EcoJet also runs on B100 
biodiesel. We get ours from Seattle 
Biodiesel. There are two 18-gallon 
fuel tanks: a left tank for Jet A fuel 
and a right tank for biodiesel. We 
start the car on jet fuel and switch 
to B100 once we’re out on the 
road. We always switch back to jet 
fuel before shutdown, so we don’t 
gum up the fuel-control unit. We 
haven’t noticed a real fuel-economy 
difference between the two fuels. 
A turbine gobbles any fuel that 
burns with oxygen—uuurrrrrrppp! 
It’s like a big guy at a buffet. It just 
eats everything.

lift decrease. The faster the 
helicopter goes, the greater 
the discrepancy. If the speed 
increases too much, the 
machine will tend to roll to 
one side and the retreating 
blade will stall, generating no 
upward force at all. The speed 
limit for any conventional 
helicopter is about 185 mph. 
But that wasn’t good enough 
for Steve Weiner, the X2’s 
chief engineer: “We wanted 
to go faster.”
Weiner’s team replaced 
the single rotor with twin, 
26.4-foot-long rotors that spin 
in opposite directions on the 
same axis. The rotors both 
produce dissymmetry of lift, 
but in countervailing direc-
tions. Goodbye, instability. 
Hello, speed records. 
The X2 is the descendant 
of the XH-59A, a machine with 
the same stacked rotor con-
figuration that the company 
built with NASA and the U.S. 
Army in the 1970s. It was 
unwieldy, and the project was 
shelved—but Sikorsky engi-
neers never gave up on it. In 
recent years, they innovated a 
new vibration-control system 
and digital fly-by-wire con-
trols, and added a pusher pro-
peller on the tail to boost 
speed. (The X2 doesn’t need a 
tail rotor, which counters a 
typical helicopter’s tendency 
to spin in place.) 
Sikorsky doesn’t know 
whether its first clients will 
be military or commercial or 
both. For now, the X2 team 
has set the speed bar high—
at 287 mph. “But the physics 
say we can probably go to 300 
knots,” Weiner says. At that 
speed—nearly 350 mph—a 
medical transport helicopter 
could fly 150 miles, pick up a 
patient and return to a hos-
pital by the time a conven-
tional helicopter simply 
arrived on the scene.
For a century, scientists have known that a trickle of electricity could be harvested 
from the metabolic reactions of bacteria living in soil. to most scientists, it was a parlor 
trick—a lot of effort to generate a tiny current. now, a team at Harvard called Lebônê 
has used the idea to design an inexpensive battery for use in sub-Saharan africa, where 
more than 500 million people live without power. the microbial fuel cell, or MFc, can 
produce enough current to power LeD lights and charge cellphone batteries. In 2008, 
Lebônê (the word means “light stick” in southern africa’s Sotho language) field-tested 
its first prototype in tanzania, the home country of team member Stephen Lwendo. 
Simple and cheap, the MFc came in a 5-gallon bucket. It consisted of a graphite-cloth 
anode, a chicken-wire cathode, manure-rich mud for fuel, a layer of sand to act as an 
ion barrier and salt water as an electrolyte—all attached to an electronic power- 
management board. In June 2009, team members traveled to namibia to launch a pilot 
program featuring 100 MFcs made from small canvas bags that can be linked for 
increased voltage. the bags are filled with dirt and buried. When watered to keep the 
microbes munching, the buried cells can produce power for months. “rural africans 
are used to getting resources out of the ground,” says team member aviva Presser 
 aiden, a doctoral student in applied math and genomics at the Broad Institute of MIt 
and Harvard. “We want to tap that familiarity.”

brilliant idea: allow 
users to control a computer 
with natural movements.
The compuTer keyboard and mouse do 
an admirable job of letting users drag and drop 
words, numbers and pictures. but gaming 
presents a far tougher test for any user inter-
face—it requires us to swing bats, turn wheels, 
duck through doorways. “you’re trying to trans-
late a real-world action to the corresponding 
buttons on a controller,” says alex kipman, 
director of incubation for microsoft’s Xbox. “a 
lot gets lost in translation.”
This explains the runaway success of the Nin-
tendo Wii—the motion-sensing wand controller 
has proved irresistible to millions. Now, micro-
soft is going even further with project Natal, a 
yet-to-be-released peripheral for the Xbox 360.

Instead of mashing buttons—or even swinging 
wands—players can use their entire bodies.  
This sorcery relies on some standard tech-
nologies: a Web camera and a near-infrared 
depth sensor that track movement even in the 
dark, plus sophisticated microphones. Natal 
recognizes your voice and face, interprets your 
gestures and translates everything into an ava-
tar that interacts with onscreen objects. 
The implications go far beyond gaming. 
The technology could help smart houses moni-
tor their owners’ health, or allow engineers to 
sculpt 3d shapes with their hands. Some day, 
such computer interfaces could seem as ordi-
nary as the pc keyboard does today.

Innovators: eric bachtell (ball aerospace), william borucki, 
david koch (nasa), doug caldwell, Jon Jenkins (seti institute), 
david latham (Harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics) 
brIllIant Idea: a multiyear survey of 100,000 stars, in 
search of planets where alien life may thrive.
As president of his dela-
van, Wis., high school science 
club in the 1950s, William 
Borucki helped build a device—
a magnetometer coupled with 
ultraviolet and infrared trans-
mitters—to contact Ufos. the 
technology was sound, but  
the test subjects never showed 
up. however, Borucki, now a 
space scientist at nAsA’s Ames 
research Center, didn’t aban-
don his preoccupation with 
aliens. for two decades, he has 
argued that by taking pictures 
of planets as they pass in front 
of their home stars, scientists 
could identify likely sites for 
life in other solar systems. 
he and his colleagues per-
severed in the face of enduring 
skepticism from nAsA manag-
ers. Borucki and doug Caldwell 
of the seti (search for extrater-
restrial intelligence) institute 
proved they could capture the 
images with charge-coupled 
devices, or CCds, like the ones 
used in digital cameras. seti’s 
Jon Jenkins wrote algorithms 
to distinguish small planets 
from the “noise” of deep space. 
fellow Ames scientist david 
Koch banged together a minia-
ture steel-and-styrofoam dem-
onstrator with the help of 
machine shops in the Bay Area. 
“By 2000, we had done all the 
things they asked,” says the 
soft- spoken Borucki, now 70 
years old. With the launch of an 
instrument- laden rocket last 
March, the mission, dubbed 
Kepler, became reality. 
the spacecraft will aim its 
42 CCds at a group of 100,000-
plus stars in our region of the 
Milky Way (within 600 to 3000 
light-years of earth). if a planet 
transits in front of its star, the 
instrument will record a change 
in brightness, helping research-
ers to deduce the  planet’s size. 
further observations will yield 
the length of its orbit, an esti-
mate of its temperature and a 
judgment on  whether liquid 
water might exist there. the 
mission will last until at least 
2012—and hopefully bring us  
a step closer to fulfilling 
Borucki’s youthful ambition of 
glimpsing signs of alien life.  
The Kepler 
telescope— 
a 15-foot-long, 
$600 million 
tool for finding 
Earth-like  
planets—cap-
tured its first 
image in April.
The mosT popular alternatives to fossil fuels 
for generating electricity—wind and solar—
don’t look so good once the sun sets and the 
wind dies down. To provide a home with reli-
able power, either technology must be coupled 
with an energy-storage system. For now, that 
means a bank of lead-acid batteries. But there’s 
a better way, according to research scientist 
Grover Coors. “The problem [with lead-acid bat-
teries] is they tend to fail after a few hundred 
charge–discharge cycles,” he says. “We need a 
battery that cycles so many times we lose count.” 
sodium-sulfur batteries are a promising alter-
native, but only for industrial settings—they 
operate at temperatures around 600 F, far too 
hot to sit in anyone’s basement.
Coors was the chief scientist at CoorsTek, an 
advanced ceramics company founded by his 
great-grandfather, the brewer adolph Coors, 
when the company bought a ceramics r&D firm 
last year. Coors knew that the new subsidiary, 
Ceramatec, was working on a material that 
could form the electrolyte heart of a sodium bat-
tery cool enough for residential use. Coors and 
fellow researcher John Watkins built a promis-
ing prototype by sandwiching the  material— 
a sodium super-ionic conductor—between a 
sodium metal anode and a still-undisclosed 
aqueous cathode. Now they hope to develop a 
$2000 refrigerator-size unit that can yield 5 kilo-
watts for 4 hours before recharging— and keep 
it up for 10 years. If they succeed, it could help 
bring at-home generation of electricity from the 
margins into the mainstream.

brIllIant Idea: a whole-house battery that 
could help make home generation of electricity a 
mainstream alternative. 

ChemiCal roCkets are ponderous. the 
space shuttle, for instance, carries more than 
3.8 million pounds of expensive propellant—
even empty, its two solid boosters weigh 
193,000 pounds apiece. oleg Batishchev, prin-
cipal research scientist at mit’s Department of 
aeronautics and astronautics, appreciates 
such rockets for their raw, earth-escaping 
punch. But once a craft hits orbit, he says, his 
new invention makes more sense: the mini-
helicon Plasma thruster is designed to be a 
lighter, cheaper way to move through space.  
Batishchev’s engine relies on the accelera-
tion of plasma, a gaseous cloud in which atoms 
have been stripped of their electrons, making 
the entire mass highly conductive and respon-
sive to electromagnetic fields. Nasa developed a 
similar engine for its Deep space 1 mission, 
launched in 1998, but the new thruster has 
advantages. to start, Nasa employed pricey 
xenon gas ($13 per liter) excited into plasma by 
delicate electrical components, while the new 
design uses nitrogen (5 cents per liter) activated 
by a rugged radio-frequency antenna. a mag-
netic field channels the plasma through a nozzle 
at a stunning 40 km/sec, an order of magnitude 
greater than the output of a chemical rocket. 
“For the same amount of fuel, we’re getting 10 
times more thrust,” Batishchev says. that effi-
ciency may one day win the thruster a trip to 
mars. in the meantime, it could replace chemi-
cal rockets for pushing satellites from low earth 
orbit to geostationary orbit. For this application, 
older ion engines are too pricey, Batishchev says: 
“if we’re talking about applications like the 
privatization of space, this makes more sense.”

medicine: inexpensive lab-on-a-
chip diagnostic tool
medical lab tests are often expensive and 
slow. thanks to microfluidics, also known as lab-
on-a-chip technology, a new generation of hand-
held diagnostic devices may soon arrive in the 
world’s advanced hospitals. the new technology 
will perform tests with greater automation—using 
much smaller samples of blood or other fluids—
than today’s methods. but Harvard chemist 
George Whitesides believes the high-tech tests 
can have their greatest impact in decidedly low-
tech surroundings, namely poorly staffed and 
equipped medical facilities in developing coun-
tries. When he challenged his colleagues to create 
a micro fluidics device for such a setting, they 
experi mented with silicon and plastic chips, but 
eventually adopted a less pricey technology: paper. 
“even a few cents for each device is expensive,” 
group member andres martinez says. “the over-
arching goal of the project was to make essentially 
a zero-cost device.” Not only is paper cheap and 
easy to produce in high volumes, but it can be 
incinerated after use, an advantage in poor regions 
where medical waste disposal is a challenge.
Paper naturally draws in liquids through tiny 
capillaries, eliminating the need for a typical lab-
on-a-chip’s miniaturized pump. the team embeds 
water-shunning polymers on the paper to form 
channels, which can lead a drop of blood or  other 
fluid to tiny reservoirs filled with chemical 
reagents. the lab’s first assay, or test, is for liver 
disease, a frequent side effect of aids medica-
tions. if blood contains alkaline phosphate, a 
liver- disease biomarker, the reagent turns purple. 
in the future, a single postage-stamp-size device 
might test for the presence of a number of viruses 
and medical conditions. to run such a test, there 
would be no need to draw blood from a vein, 
refrigerate the sample or have access to electricity. 
the team hopes that test results could be photo-
graphed with cellphone cameras by minimally 
trained workers and transmitted to doctors and 
nurses for analysis. and while it’s being designed 
for the rigors of the developing world, the technol-
ogy has the potential to revolutionize diagnostics 
in industrialized countries as well.

Brilliant idea: the first useful flying car, which 
will soon carry medicine and supplies to remote 
settlements in the amazon.
Steve Saint, 59, grew up in ecuador in a family of 
missionaries, spending his summers in a Huao rani 
village in the amazon. a decade ago, he started the 
indigenous people’s technology and education Cen-
ter (i-teC), an “engineering ministry” based in 
 Florida. then Saint, who is a pilot, decided that i-teC 
would build a flying car. (See “the Mission,” May ’09.) 
this is a field where dreamers can fruitlessly waste 
years, but Saint was confident that his machine would 
help the Huaorani get around their largely roadless 
world of rain forests and rivers. now, it’s ready. pow-
ered by a 128-hp engine, the 1100-pound Maverick 
can go 80 mph on pavement and then keep rolling 
over dirt tracks. when the road ends  altogether, the 
pilot hoists a parachute up a carbon-fiber mast and 
shifts into flight mode, shifting power from the 
wheels to a five-bladed propeller in back. the Maver-
ick can replace a days-long hike for medical help with 
a half-hour flight. Saint, who plans to start selling 
Mavericks within a year, sees users beyond the ama-
zon: “we’re looking at the end-of-the-road market-
place—pipeline inspectors, ranchers herding cattle 
or checking fences.” the key, he says, is to keep the 
Maverick simple. “if we’re going to make this the 
Ford of flying cars, it has to be easy to fly.”

ing his new bot, schroll decid-
ed, was a set of gyroscopes that 
would store momentum before 
reaching an obstacle.
at MiT’s famously well-
equipped hobby shop, schroll 
used an abrasive water-jet 
machine to cut aluminum and 
steel parts for his prototype. he 
plundered parts from radio-
control helicopters and cars 
and, for an outer shell, repur-
posed an 18-inch gumball-
machine globe from the Wizard 
Vending Co. For traction, he 
attached rubber strips from a 
playground kickball. The result 
was a remote-control ball that 
could navigate steep, rugged ter-
rain, even from a dead stop. ken 
stone, director of the hobby 
shop for 18 years, calls schroll 
the best student designer and 
builder he’s ever seen. “MiT’s 
motto is ‘Mind and hand,’ and 
the school’s success has been 
all about people with that ability 
to build—to bring an idea to 
reality,” stone says. “Greg is the 
embodiment of that idea.” 
now a grad student at Colo-
rado state University, schroll is 
enhancing his bot with sensors, 
including an inertial measure-
ment unit typically used in air-
planes and guided missiles. he 
envisions the technology being 
used to explore everything from 
alien planets to hazardous 
waste sites. since the outer 
shell is a continuous surface, it 
could be made impervious to 
harmful chemicals or hermeti-
cally sealed and made to float 
in water. “One of my fantasy 
ideas is to build it with enough 
suspension to allow it to be air-
dropped,” he says. “i imagine a 
cargo plane dumping 1000 of 
these spherical robots. They 
wouldn’t need any landing 
equipment. They’d bounce and 
start collecting information.” 
robot can’t climb steep inclines 
or stairs. My goal was to over-
come that limitation.”
That was a big challenge for 
an undergrad, but schroll, with 
his father’s help, had already

world at first appear mysteri-
ous, and then you start to see 
general patterns. And I realized 
there must be some rules and 
that they’re comprehensible. I 
later decided that’s what 
physics is all about—giving me 
the rules of the world. 
PM: As a teenager, you had a 
company that made audio­
visual controllers. Did the 
customers know you were in 
high school? 
DK: No, no. And we worked 
hard to keep it that way.  
My younger brother would 
bring his friends over after 
school and they’d solder 
circuit boards down in the 
basement. My mother would 
send out invoices.
PM: How did you go from that 
to medical devices?
DK: My older brother would 
come home from med school, 
and his focus was pediatric 
hematology and oncology, 
which is essentially taking care 
of little babies with leukemia. 
It’s not a happy thing. He would 
come into the basement and 
say, “You know what I really 
need? I can’t deliver the right 
amount of a drug because all 
the equipment that we have in 
a hospital is sized for an adult.” 
So I made a little precision 
device. I did this for maybe two, 
three years. My day job was 
making money doing the 
audiovisual stuff, and on the 
side I’m building medical 
equipment for my brother. 
Remember, these are the days 
before the Food and Drug 
Administration had authority 
over medical devices. I just 
made this thing, and my 
brother would go into the 
hospital and do experiments.
PM: Eventually, though, that 
device did become a business, 
once you adapted it to deliver 
Dean Kamen’s first visit 
to a machine shop was a
revelation. He was too young to drive, so he bummed a 
ride. The smell of oil, the glistening equipment, the grinders throwing sparks—so 
this was how precision parts were made. When Kamen started his first company, 
while still in high school, he outfitted his own machine shop in his parent’s base-
ment. “Each time I bought a tool,” he says, “I extended my capability to do some-
thing, to make something.”
He certainly did. While still an undergraduate, Kamen created the first wear-
able infusion pump to steadily deliver vital drugs, reducing the time patients were 
confined to hospitals. Among his inventions are a portable kidney dialysis machine 
for use in patients’ homes, the iBOT wheelchair (which can climb stairs), a futuris-
tic prosthetic arm and the Slingshot water purifier to improve health in impover-
ished parts of the globe. In 1989, Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Rec-
ognition of Science and Technology), a high-energy robotics competition for teens. 
“My greatest invention,” he says, “is helping create thousands of new inventors.”
Along the way, Kamen fulfilled any kid’s dream of life as a modern Edison, with 
helicopters and airplanes that he pilots himself, a private island in Long Island 
Sound that jokingly seceded from the United States and a high-tech company with 
about 200 employees, housed in a beautiful 19th-century textile mill fronting the 
Merrimack River in Manchester, N.H. Popular Mechanics editor-in-chief Jim 
Meigs and deputy editor Jerry Beilinson joined the inventor in the office of DEKA 
Research and Development to discuss innovation, Kamen’s hope for the future of 
America and his hands-down favorite piece of technology ever.

PM: Can you remember the 
first time you used a tool? 
DK: No, I can’t. I guess as a kid  
I was more of a born physicist 
than an engineer. I remember 
thinking about how a ball 
bounces—very predictably. On 
each consecutive bounce it 
goes a little less high until it 
stops. It never is sitting there 
and suddenly starts to bounce 
and gets higher and higher.

DK: So you go from childhood 
leukemia, which we hope 
remains one of the rarest 
conditions in the world, to the 
most common chronic disease 
state where you need continu­
ous infusion of a drug. 
Suddenly, boom—we might 
help define a whole new 
generation of ways to treat 
chronic disease.  
PM: Could some kid today do 
what you did—invent a 
medical device? 
DK: Some parts of it are frankly 
much easier to do and some 
parts are harder. The technol­
ogies are easier because 
there’s such a huge amount of 
technology on the shelf. 
There’s almost no amount of 
computation that’s not 
available at a very low cost.
The irony of that is that 
society has become withdrawn 
and nervous about technology, 
about change, about the 
future. Whether it’s terrorism 
or the swine flu, people are way 
more risk­averse than they ever 
were before. 
I mean, there was a time 
when most people thought you 
could do whatever you wanted 
except extraordinary things 
where you better go check. We 
now live in a world where little 
kids will walk by the river 
outside my window and say, 
“Are we allowed to touch the 
water?” You know, they go to a 
playground and say, “Are we 
allowed to use that?” I think 
we live in a world where 
everybody is looking for  
some authority to give them 
permission to do anything, 
including think. 
PM: What’s your opinion of the 
debate over healthcare?
DK: I’m very worried that the 
entire debate is misguided. I 
mean the whole supposition: 
“We have a crisis in health­
care.” Our healthcare system is 
developing incredible  devices 
to improve the quality of 
people’s lives. We’re develop­
ing pharmaceuticals that 
alleviate the need for surgery. 
We’re making the surgeries 
that are necessary ever less 
invasive. If we have a crisis, it’s 
the embarrassment of riches.

and concerns about health-
care being rationed?

come into existence because 
that will mean rationing.” 
Well, I hate to tell you the 
news, but as soon as medicine 
started being able to do 
incredible things that are very 
expensive, we started ration­
ing. The reason 100 years ago 
everyone could afford their 
healthcare is because 
healthcare was a doctor giving 
you some elixir and telling you, 
you’ll be fine.Of course we 
ration today. 
PM: So what’s the answer? 
DK: The way to ration less is to 
make more good technical 
solutions. Diabetes alone, if 
you include all of the long­
term, insidious consequences, 
is responsible for about 30 
percent of the federal 
reimbursement for healthcare. 
But what if tomorrow we could 
wipe out diabetes? I’m sure in

did it actually cost to deal with

horrific costs of treating

better, simpler and cheaper, 
well, you know what? We 
might actually get to that being 
the situation—if we stop 
investing in technology, if we 
stop believing that the future 
ought to be better than the 
past. I think this debate shows 
a fundamental lack of vision, a 
lack of understanding of 
what’s possible.

will be considered your 
biggest contribution?

of opportunities to do 
something unbelievable. You

hands-on learning in schools?
DK: Most of what kids get in 
school is at a pretty high level 
of abstraction, especially in 
math and science. Imagine  
if we said it’s important for 
kids to really love and get 
involved in some critical 
skill—like football. So we’ll 
make a football curriculum. At 
five or six years old we’ll show 
them pictures in a book. The 
next year we’ll explain some of 
the rules, and give tests on 
them. And this will go on for 
eight or 10 years before they’re 
ever allowed to touch the ball 
or play the game. You’d say, 
“Well, Dean, nobody would do 
that. That’s idiotic.” Really? 
That’s the world of engineer-
ing. At five or six years old we 
teach kids what the numbers 
look like. Then we test them on 
adding and subtracting. By the 
time they’re 17 years old, and 
you say, “Have you ever used 
trigonometry to do anything in 
your life, ever? Ever?” And 
they’ll look at you. 
This is a really bad time for 
this country to sit back on its

honeywell wind turbine 
Noise, bulk and inconsistent winds have hampered the adoption of wind 
turbines by homeowners, but a new design could change that. Imad 
Mahawili, a chemical engineer and long-time wind-energy consultant, 
has reimagined the technology to take advantage of even light breezes. 
In a typical wind turbine, air moves the blades, which turn gears to spin a 
generator and produce a current. Those mechanical linkages siphon off 
a good deal of wind energy before it can be converted to electricity. 
Mahawili’s system, the Honeywell Wind Turbine, eliminates the 
separate generator, and therefore the gearing. The blades are tipped with 
magnets and enclosed in a wheel that contains coiled copper—in other 
words, the turbine itself is the electrical generator. With conventional 
designs, “It takes 7 to 8 mph to overcome the resistance of gears,” 
Mahawili says. The new system, which weighs 165 pounds and costs 
about $5500, works in 2-mph winds.
Brilliant innovations—most of them, at least—
make their greatest contributions once they become prod-
ucts people can buy. this year’s winners trim energy use, 
enhance communication and just make life more fun.

Ford EcoBoost V6 
Ford has built the first of a new 
breed of turbo engines designed 
to improve fuel efficiency. In the 
past, turbocharged engines have 
been used to boost power rather 
than save fuel. They ran at 
efficiency-killing low compres-
sion ratios and rich air/fuel 
ratios to prevent meltdowns. The 
365-hp 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 
uses several tricks to overcome 
these limitations. For instance, 
the direct fuel-injection system 
squirts fuel into the combustion 
chamber instead of the intake 
ports—this cools the chamber, 
allowing for a fairly high 10.0:1 
compression ratio. The new V6 
debuted in the Lincoln MKT and 
MKS, and the Ford Taurus SHO.

To build a bench, the author 
placed each hand-shaped stone, then 
trimmed away the excess mortar.
When I was growing up in New England, it seemed there was always a rock lurking just below the ground’s 
surface. It frustrated the smallest job, like driving a tent peg, and often sabotaged larger proj-
ects, from digging a posthole to planting a shrub. Wherever this schist and basalt surfaced like a 
shark fin, it ruined everything that touched it, whether that was a mower blade or your shin. 
The only good way to deal with a rock, in my opinion, is to pry it out of the ground and use it 
to build something. That’s how you get even with it—put it to work. 
I learned that lesson early at my dad’s side. He was an engineer, a born builder. We had just 
moved to rural Connecticut in the late 1960s, and our furniture was barely out of the moving van 
when he started digging up rocks and extending the house’s retaining walls.
We also made rock, after a fashion. Mixing and placing concrete, my father, my brothers and I

built walks and made foundation slabs. Some of my first mem-
ories go back to mixing concrete with my dad, when I was so 
small all I could do was pretend to help. In the 1960s and ’70s, 
fathers and sons had time for these things. 
My dad, a widower, still lives in the house where I was 
raised, surrounded by our construction projects—among 
them a walkway, a patio and a shed I built when I was 16. When 
he turned 85 recently, there wasn’t much I could buy him, so I 
decided to build something as a gift. That would be fitting.
Laying a Foundation 
I’ve always been fascinated by stonework, 
from elegant limestone-clad office buildings 
to Pennsylvania farmhouses with walls neatly 
laid up with rock from the fields nearby. But, 
oddly enough, I’ve hardly constructed any-
thing from stone since I was a kid—concrete 
block and brick, sure, but not natural stone. 
My first thought was to build my dad an out-
door stone fireplace that I found in an old 
issue of Popular Mechanics. But the more I 
studied the drawing, the more I realized how 
out of place it would look in his backyard. It 
was massive, suited to big, late-night barbe-
cue parties. The yard was a contemplative 
spot, shaggy with shrubs that my father had 
planted when I was a boy. Besides, he already 
had a small charcoal grill that he was quite 
happy with. A rustic stone bench would be 
more appropriate, I thought.
I took my dad out to a local diner to discuss 
the idea—it was the same place where we’d 
hashed out long-ago plans over plates of meat-
loaf. He sat across from me, quietly surveying 
the menu. “You know,” he mused, “this place 
makes the best whiskey sour around.” After a 
pause, he asked, “So tell me, what do you want 
to build?” “Simple,” I said. “A stone bench. 
Two pillars and a seat.” “Sounds good,” he 
replied. Permission granted. 
On an unusually cool summer morning,  
I drove out to Swenson Granite Works in  
Newtown, Conn. When I was a kid, you bought 
stone at a quarry or a masonry yard, places 
with a massive truck scale outside the office 
window. Dust devils would swirl by as you 
shouted above the roar of rock crushers and 
front-end loaders. The Swenson yard was neat 
and quiet. I struck up a conversation with 
John Doherty, the assistant manager. “This is 
nice stuff,” I said, admiring a silver-flecked 
slab of granite trucked down 
from Barre, Vermont. “It’s 
the only permanent building material,” he said. “It’ll be here 
long after we’re gone.” The beautiful slabs were cut with a  
furniture-like precision and crisply stacked. Flanking them 
were pallets of fieldstone wrapped in wire. 
I had already decided to build the legs, or pillars, with rustic 
stone reminiscent of the stone walls that trace the hills of 
southern New England. Now, for the seat, I had to choose 
between the granite and less-formal blue stone. I decided the 
blue stone would be more in keeping with my dad’s yard, and 

unaltered, or it may 
need to be cut to 
shape. The process 
creates a pile of stone 
chips and debris.  
Useful pieces, stored  
in a bucket, can be 
employed later as  
the pillar rises.

torpedo level in their

out frequently to

Rock is irregular, and 
it’s easy for a pillar  
to go out of plumb in 
the course of  
construction.
the  
making of a bench
 1. The bench’s 
foundation is a pair of 
4-inch-thick concrete 
footings. I penciled 
each pillar’s square 
footprint onto a 
footing. Then came 
mortar and, finally, the 
first rock, carefully

ordered that, plus rock for the pillars. I signed 
on the dotted line for delivery. Then, before I 
left, I bought a pair of chisels—a point and a 
tracer, both from Trow & Holden, a legendary 
New England company. The point breaks off 
high spots and roughs stone to shape; the 
tracer splits more precisely. 
Back at my dad’s, I hammered together two forms for the 
pillars’ concrete footings and dug them in, hitting rocks with 
every jab of the shovel. Next came the footings themselves. It 
always feels good to mix concrete. I was working over the first 
footing when I heard the screen door close. “Did you strike off 
the excess with a piece of lumber?” my father asked. “Just like 
you taught me when I was 12,” I replied. I remembered the 
lesson: Overfill the form, push the concrete down and con-
solidate it, then strike off the excess in a sawing motion with 
a 2 x 4 held on edge. Finish it with a float, which is nothing 
more than a piece of  wood with a handle. That smooths 
cement paste and sand that have been worked (or floated) to 
the top. My dad nodded and left for a meeting of a volunteer 
group he chairs. He’s got a lot on his plate for a guy his age.
I mixed and placed the concrete for the second footing and 
had just begun floating it when there was a squeal of air brakes 
and a backup horn from out front. If you want materials deliv-
ered, just start floating a piece of concrete. Works every time.  
I jogged out front to take the delivery of stone, and the driver 
neatly deposited the load using the truck’s hydraulic arm.

Building Pillars 
The fireplace plans that inspired the bench were published in 
PM in 1938, when rustic architecture was popular, especially in 
the cabins and visitor centers built in national parks before 
World War II. The masonry was deceptive—seemingly untu-
tored, actually sophisticated. Like the Arts and Crafts wood-
workers of the same period, rustic builders were trying to evoke 
an earlier time, before the era of mass production.   
That seemingly primitive look is what I was shooting for in 
my dad’s bench. I hauled a heap of stone into the backyard, 
dumped each load, sorted it, wire-brushed away mud and 
stacked the material by size and shape. I cracked big stones in 
half with a stone hammer and split off lumps using the  chisels. 
I dry-stacked the first pillar, stone by stone, pausing occasion-
ally to look at it from various angles. When it was done, I stood 
back and gave it a long, hard look. It was awful. 
A properly placed stone looks like it “belongs,” according 
to Stonework Techniques and Projects, a book by mason Charles 
McRaven that I’d been consulting. None of my stones looked 
like they belonged there, or anywhere.   
I started over. Having learned a few things, I did better this 
time around. I mixed my mortar and slowly laid up the pillar. 
It was a bit rougher than I’d planned, but serviceable. Work on 
the second pillar came more easily until close to the top, when 
I couldn’t find the right stone for a tricky corner. My father 
came by to check on me. “Here,” he said, handing me a stone, 
“try this one.” It was too small. “Too much mortar would show, 
dad,” I said gruffly. I felt bad as soon as I said it. “Well, try this 
one, then,” he offered. I was relieved I hadn’t hurt his feelings. 
With a little chisel work, the stone made a pretty good fit, and 
my dad shot me a look as if to say, “See?” A few more stones 
and the pillar was finished. All that was left was to add the 
blue-stone seat, a job I’d tackle on my next visit.
Yellow leaves were mingled with the summer’s foliage by the 
time I got back up to my dad’s. Before installing the seat I 
wanted to chisel a bevel into its edge, using a technique known 
as “rocking” that leaves a more natural look. I started slow, set-
ting the tool with two taps, then beveling with a third firm strike. 
After finishing one edge, I felt confident enough to flip the slab 
and quickly rock the other side with solid, single blows.
There was a half-bag of Type S mortar left, and I mixed up a 
couple of shovels’ worth. The right-hand pillar was a bit 
shorter than the left, and from the mound of leftover rock, I 
found a perfectly flat shim to top it off. I placed the mortar on 
both pillars. Then, with a ceremonious flair, my dad pushed 
the shim rock into place. With the assistance of a young helper 
I’d enlisted, I set the seat across the two pillars. The bluestone 
settled nicely, and just a couple of taps with the butt of the 
trowel handle got it dead on. I looked over my shoulder at my 
dad, who was intently studying the level’s bubble. “Not bad,” 
he said. “Not bad.”

   We Test America’s most fuel-frugal cars—
Masters

Forget about horsepower, dragstrip time slips or torque 
curves. The most important automotive performance yardstick 
of the next decade will be miles per gallon. Gyrating fuel prices 
and a cratered economy have made car buyers more concerned 
about fuel economy than ever. “It’s definitely one of their top 
factors in a purchase 
decision,” says Mike 
Omotoso, senior manager of 
powertrain forecasting for 
J.D. Power and Associates. 
But regardless of what 
consumers want, new 
Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy (CAFE) legislation 
signed in May will force 
manufacturers to improve 
their fleet fuel economy by  
5 percent each year, from 
27.3 mpg in 2011 to 35.5 
mpg by 2016. So automakers 
will need some superstar 
sippers. We gathered five of 
today’s most fuel-efficient 
cars—ones that would easily 
clear the 2016 mandate—to 
find out if they blend that 
efficiency with comfort, 
power and daily driveability. 
To represent the hybrid 
camp, we selected the Prius, 
the Ford Fusion Hybrid and 
Honda’s new Insight. The 
Audi A3 TDI carries our diesel 
baton, and Smart’s preco-
cious Fortwo—the only car 
with a plain-vanilla gasoline 
engine—blazes a trail for 
other minicars to follow. 
We put these vehicles 
through a grueling two- 
day marathon over two 
routes—220 miles of city 
driving and 320 miles on the 
highway—to represent how 
they would perform in typical 
conditions. Later, we ran each 
one through our tests at Auto 
Club Raceway in Pomona, 
Calif. Once the hard numbers 
were logged, we tackled 
some curvy roads, just for 
fun. Since these cars meet 
vastly different driving 
priorities, we judged each on 
how well it fulfills those 
duties, rather than ranking it 
against others in the test 
group. Here, we present a 
cross section of the most 
efficient cars in America.

Do they meld efficiency, 
practicality and driving fun?

→  Honda, like its crosstown 
rival Toyota, was ahead of the 
hybrid curve. Ten years ago, the 
Honda Insight, with its 
streamlined body shell and 
70-mpg rating, was the first 
hybrid car to hit American 
shores. But with only room for 
two, it sold in limited numbers. 
For 2010 the Insight has 
returned as a true Prius 
competitor. The aerodynamic 
four-door hatchback mirrors 
the profile of the Prius, a shape 
that proudly says “dedicated 
hybrid.” Yet the Insight’s price 
undercuts the Toyota’s. One 
reason is Honda’s much 
simpler hybrid system: A 13-hp 
electric motor is sandwiched 
between the 1.3-liter engine 
and the CVT. The Toyota uses a 
larger battery pack, a planetary 
gearset and a higher-torque 
electric motor that can move 
the car independently of the 
gas engine. Unlike the Toyota 
or Ford hybrid systems, the 
Honda does not allow 
prolonged electric-only 
operation, because the little 
electric motor just doesn’t have 
enough juice. However, the 
Insight switches to electric-only 
power when cruising at low 
speeds. In that case, the VTEC 
system idles the valves, so the 
engine still spins, but it doesn’t 
consume any fuel. Yet the gas 
engine must start at stoplights 
to power the air conditioning. 
So if you select Eco mode, you 
have to forgo a/c when 
stopped. We ran in this mode 
during our testing, and though 
the cabin did get hot, we were 
able to generate a solid 45.3 
mpg on the city loop. The 
Insight rides a bit rougher than 
the Prius, and doesn’t feel quite 
as polished or upscale. As a 
featherweight, it does struggle 
to maintain a consistent 
heading on freeways with high 
crosswinds. Around town, the 
Insight feels sporty and light on 
its feet as it jousts through 
traffic. There’s an honest 
simplicity to the Honda—like a 
Civic from the 1980s, the 
Insight feels tight, as though it 
would run reliably for decades.
The Insight mirrors 
the fuel efficiency 
of the more expen-
sive Civic Hybrid.

this test, and when the road 
began to twist, the Audi left 
every other car in its wake. 
The steering is delicately 
precise and provides organic 
feedback matched by none 
here. But don’t let the sporty 
moves fool you—this Audi is a 
formidable commuter. In the 
city loop, the A3 couldn’t 
quite match the hybrids or the 
Smart in fuel efficiency. But 
on the open road it returned 
42 mpg—only a few ticks 
behind the Prius. And that’s 
the beauty of this Audi: It 
makes precious few compro-
mises. You can have 
exemplary fuel efficiency 
wrapped in a fun-to-drive 
package. At around $33,000, 
this A3 TDI is a bargain.
The A3 TDI is as 
rewarding to drive 
on twisty roads as 
VW’s sporty GTI. 
So, as a practi-
cal, fuel-efficient 
and hip European 
wagon, the Audi 
has few rivals. 
The Prius cheats 
the wind to 
improve freeway 
efficiency. Its Cd of 
0.25 is the lowest 
of any car today.

Toyota Prius
→As beloved as the 
previous-generation Prius was, 
it offered a rather bland driving 
experience. The steering felt 
just as digitally distant as a Wii 
controller. This all-new model  
is vastly improved. On our 
handling test course, the Prius 
felt crisp and, dare we say, 
even fun. On the highway, 
however, the Prius was 
buffeted a bit in strong 
crosswinds. When it was time 
to load our test gear, the 
Prius’s practical hatch provided 
plenty of room—almost 40 
cubic feet with the seats 
folded. The powertrain employs 
a pair of electric motors and a 
planetary CVT linked with a 
new 1.8-liter gas engine 
packing more torque. And 
there’s even a dash-mounted 
EV switch that provides about 
a mile of electric-only range. 
Inside, our Prius was loaded 
with cool tech, including 
radar-based cruise control and 
lane assist. In the city, the Prius 
returned an incredible 52 mpg; 
on the highway, it bested the 
rest once again, delivering 46.4 
mpg. When fuel efficiency is 
the sole criterion, no other 
vehicle sold in the U.S. can 
match the Prius. It’s the 
fuel-economy champ.

Audi A3 TDI
→  Few vehicles combine 
sporty handling, luxurious 
amenities and exemplary fuel 
efficiency in one package, but 
this new A3 TDI does just 
that—and does so with a 
satisfying rush of torque. The 
U.S.-spec A3 TDI will come 
with the same 2.0-liter 
140-hp diesel that has made 
the VW Jetta TDI such  
a blockbuster hit for 
Volkswagen. Our A3 was a 
2009 Euro-spec model (2010 
U.S. production models go on 
sale in December), so it had 
an even more powerful 
170-hp version of this engine 
under the hood. The motor is 
paired to Audi’s brilliant 
six-speed Direct Shift Gearbox 
(DSG), which performs brisk 
shifts. Slide behind the wheel 
and it’s clear this is a hip 
German sport wagon. The 
seats are comfortable and 
supportive, the materials are 
all soft to the touch, and the 
dimpled-rim steering wheel 
feels as good as the ones in 
Audi’s top sport sedans. The 
A3 was one of the quickest in

Ford Fusion Hybrid
→  As much as we appreciate 
the high-mileage chops of 
traditional dedicated hybrids, 
the Fusion proves that fuel 
efficiency doesn’t necessarily 
require unconventional 

→  On paper, a car like the 
Smart makes sense for city 
commuters since it’s about 
half the length of a large sedan. 
You practically look forward to 
parking in tight spots. So in 
close confines, finding space is 
easy. And from behind the 
wheel it doesn’t feel as small 
as its exterior dimensions 
suggest—you could almost 
wear a 10-gallon hat in there. 
But the Smart has quite a few 
shortcomings. The doors and 
hatch are light and tinny. And 
over rough pavement, the 
Smart is loud and rather crude. 
The minuscule, rear-mounted, 
1.0-liter three-cylinder engine 
drives the rear wheels and 
produces an odd squatting of 
the suspension as you floor 
the throttle. It’s paired to a 
lethargic automated manual 
that requires long pauses to 
perform shifts. At the 
dragstrip, the Smart is 
certainly slow. But on our city 
drive, it had just enough power 
to keep up and delivered a 
solid 39 mpg. Freeway driving 
isn’t the Fortwo’s forte. At 
speed, the wake of an 
18-wheeler easily jostles  
the tall and narrow body.  
And it requires constant  
correction to keep on course.  
It was the least enjoyable at 
freeway speeds by a wide 
margin. Yet, the Smart drew 
admiring glances. It’s so  
cute and lovable you  
can’t help but smile. Perhaps  
a case can be made for the 
Smart as a city-only car.  
But if your travels involve 
speeds higher than 55 mph, 
there are smarter choices.

Fusion remained rock steady

matter how severely the wind 
blew across the desert. But 
when the road began to 
bend, the Fusion wasn’t a lot 
of fun. It had lazy responses 
and more body roll than the 
others. The Fusion rides and 
handles like the big sedan it 
is. Still, it’s the first American 
hybrid that puts up serious

Home tHeater is tHe ultimate platform for buyer’s 
remorse. formats change every few years, and in the past decade, 
the pace of that change has accelerated. five years ago, 720p 
HDtVs were state of the art; now 1080p tVs have more than 
double the resolution. one high-definition disc format, HD DVD, was 
obsolete within two years of its introduction. so the market has long 
favored the procrastinator, since each new season brings equipment 
with improved technology at a lower price.
But prices—at least when it comes to tVs—have stabilized. 
“seeing declines of 50 percent every year … those days are 
gone,” says paul Gagnon, an analyst with research firm Display-
search. still, equipment remains fairly affordable. a 50-inch 
lCD starts at about $1500; a comparable plasma, just over 
$1000. Waiting to buy probably won’t save you much money. 
those who haven’t shopped for home theater gear in a 
while, however, will find that the technological landscape has 
changed in ways that are subtler, yet perhaps more important, 
than the hi-def revolution of the past 10 years. the key 
advances: embedded intelligence and connectivity. these affect 
the way televisions, gaming systems and video players get 
content and how they display it. 
Change favors the educated buyer. learning the new vocabulary

HD was just the 
beginning. New 
screens and video 
gear change what 
we watch and how 
we see it.
TVs Get Smarter ...
Of all the changes occurring with home 
theater components, the new technol-
ogy showing up in digital televisions 
may seem the most arcane. The 
language of HDTV has always been 
filled with confusing jargon, but much 
of the business about 480p, 720p, 1080i 
and 1080p that obsessed shoppers for 
the past few years essentially boiled 
down to a simple concept: Higher 
resolution is generally better. However, 
now that manufacturers are no longer 
just throwing pixels at consumers, they 
have begun to develop more sophisti-
cated technology to iron out the 
shortcomings of digital video. 
LCD televisions, for instance, have a 
well-established difficulty in displaying 
dark shadows and blacks. LCD works 
by filtering a constant backlight, so 
there is often light leakage that can 
produce a muddy gray where pixels are 
supposed to be black. Newer sets are 
shifting to LED backlighting from 
previous fluorescent backlights. (LEDs 
are not an alternative to LCD; the two 
technologies work together.) LED LCD 
TVs come in two flavors: backlit TVs 
that place LEDs behind the screen and

spread to almost every category of 
audiovisual component, from game 
consoles to disc players, and it has 
spawned a new generation of set-top 
boxes and services specifically designed 
to deliver online content to your TV.
The cheapest and easiest to use of 
these networked boxes is the $100 Roku 
player, which can stream about 12,000 
movies and TV episodes from Netflix 
and 45,000 titles from Amazon’s Video 
On Demand. Roku has also recently 
added access to Major League Baseball 
games and will soon provide 
commercial- supported programs. 
Roku’s services use streaming video, 
so the quality is limited by the speed of 
your Internet connection. Netflix, for 
instance, has a minimum requirement 
of 1.5 megabits per second, which is 
about the speed of an entry-level 
broadband connection. Most offerings 
are in standard definition. And even 
most HD movie titles, such as The 
Curious Case of Benjamin Button and 
Casino Royale, which we streamed from 
Amazon, don’t look much different 
from standard-def DVDs because of a 
relatively low bit rate (the amount of 
video data transmitted per second).
Apple’s contribution to the living 
room, the Apple TV (starting at $229), 
allows for higher-quality video because 
content is downloaded to the device’s 
hard drive before playing. The Apple 
TV’s HD movies aren’t quite Blu-ray 
quality, but a few feet back from the 
screen you’d be hard-pressed to notice 
the difference. All the download video 
services allow viewers to start watching 
a movie or show after just part of it has 
downloaded. For standard-def movies 
the wait is generally only a few minutes, 
but our tests showed that an HD movie 
over a slow connection can take more 
than an hour before it’s watchable.
edge-lit models that pipe in light from 
the sides of the frame. LED-backlit 
screens can perform a neat function 
called local dimming, in which 
sections of the screen vary brightness 
to improve the black level. Edge 
lighting doesn’t necessarily improve 
blacks, but it allows screens to get 
seriously skinny.
... And Fast Too. 
A more nettlesome problem for LCD 
sets is caused by a trick of the eye that 
creates a perceived blur during 
fast-motion scenes. Other display 
technologies, including plasma, tube 
TV and even film projection, use rapidly 
flickering images. When the screen is 
dark between frames, your mind fills in 
the missing detail to perceive smooth 
motion. But LCD screens use a light 
source that is always on; most don’t 
have a dark phase. So LCD makers such 
as LG, Samsung, Sony and Vizio 
generate the in-between details for you 
by displaying up to nine artificial 
frames. These sets are sold by frame 
speed: 120 Hz and 240 Hz. (Normal 
television video runs at 60 Hz, or 60 
frames per second.) 
The higher rates result in smoother 
video. But things can get a little weird 
when watching movies, which are 
typically shot at 24 frames per second. 
In our test of a 46-inch Samsung Series 
8000 model ($3200), the familiar 
lustrous feel of cinema footage was 
transformed by the 240-Hz technology 
into crisp video that looked as if it came 
from an HD camcorder. Luckily, if you 
don’t like the effect, you can turn it off.
Even though motion blur is less of a 
problem with plasma sets, Panasonic’s 
Viera S1 plasmas (starting at $1100)  
are also seriously speedy. The S1’s 
600-Hz subfield drive flashes pixels 10 
times for every frame of video. A more 
important improvement: energy 
efficiency. Plasmas are well-known 
power hogs—many 40-plus-inch TVs 
draw more than 400 watts. But a 46-inch 
S1 is rated at an average 207 watts.

to fight motion blur.

... Current Gear Gets an 
Upgrade ...
The dedicated Internet video set-top 
box may prove to be merely a transi-
tional technology, since many other 
products are embracing online video. 
Some devices you may already own can 
be upgraded via software to allow 
access to online video streams and 
downloads. TiVo digital video recorders 
(starting at $300) can now access Netflix 
and Amazon and will soon provide 
streams from Blockbuster. 
Owners of Sony’s PlayStation 3 game 
console (starting at $300) can add video 
capability for free. With an Xbox Live 
Gold membership ($50 per year), you 
can use Microsoft’s Xbox 360 (also 
starting at $300) to rent HD movies and 
stream content from Netflix. And if 
you’re willing to hook a computer 
directly to your TV, you can watch plenty 
of free shows and movies through 
online services such as Hulu.com.
One might think all this online 
content would be an argument against 
buying a Blu-ray player. But new Blu-ray 
devices from LG, Samsung and Sony are 
in on the online content game too. In 
addition to playing hi-def discs, these 
machines can access YouTube, Netflix 
and movie rental services such as 
Roxio’s CinemaNow. 
With the right TV, you could bypass 
all these machines and access online 
content directly. New connected TVs 
from LG, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony 
and Vizio can link to online informa-
tion such as weather, stocks and sports 
scores through services such as Yahoo 
Widgets, plus stream video from 
sources such as Amazon, Blockbuster 
and Showtime.
Some TV sets from LG and Vizio can 
also play ultra-high-quality 1080p 
movies and shows from Vudu, a former 
set-top maker that now runs a 
streaming- video service. Vudu’s HDX 
format is nearly indistinguishable from 
Blu-ray in terms of quality—but it 
requires a fast Internet connection with 
a speed of at least 9 Mbps.
... And a Video Store Comes to 
Your Couch. 
Most download stores charge $2 to $3 to 
purchase a TV show. Pricing for movies 
is more complicated. Some are sold ($3 
to $20) and others rented ($1 to $5, with 
a limited time to watch before they 
expire). HD rentals are usually a few 
dollars more; pirating concerns mean 
few HD titles are for sale. A Netflix 
monthly plan of $9 or more allows you 
to stream as much as you like, virtually 
all in standard def.
Online video offers the potential for 
instant access to infinite content, but 
current selections can be pretty 
hit-or-miss. Out of a sampling of 27 
recent popular movies, Netflix offered 
just five. Apple and Vudu provided the 
most, with 21, while Sony and Vudu 
featured the most in HD, at 14 each. 
With so many overlapping and 
evolving services, the impulse to wait 
out the market is understandable. But 
the wait may take a while. Online home 
theater options are proliferating, not 
consolidating. Yet while online 
entertainment provides instant 
gratification for some titles, shiny discs 
still offer higher quality and a wider 
selection. So for the foreseeable future, 
no one machine or service will answer 
all your entertainment needs. The 
upside is that, with the proper gear, 
there is more choice than ever. PM
As home theaters and TVs 
become more like PCs, 
some device manufactur-
ers have started ditching 
the standard remote in 
favor of a more computer-
like onscreen interface. 
But as manufacturers 
attempt to reach a 
consensus on the AV 
interface of the future, 
you’re likely to encounter a 
diversity of controllers. 
Several models of Vizio 
TVs now have Bluetooth 
remotes with slide-out 
qwerty keypads. 
Yamaha’s NeoHD 
surround-sound systems 
(starting at $600) opt for 
fewer buttons. The 
NeoHD receiver has no 
screen and comes with a 
simplified remote. The 
receiver creates virtual 
controls for all of your AV 
gear and displays them on 
your TV screen. 
Or you could use the 
screen in your pocket. 
Bobby and Unify4life offer 
universal-remote apps for 
iPhones or BlackBerries 
and adapters that 
translate Wi-Fi or 
Bluetooth commands  
into infrared commands 
for AV gear. 
Networked devices 
such as the TiVo HD 
DVR [ 1 ] and the 
Sony PlayStation 3 
[ 2 ] can be updated 
to increase function-
ality. Both are  
now able to access 
online video.

The first time I installed crown mold-
ing, I probably wasn’t really installing it 
at all—I was just handing my dad tools 
off the truck. since then, I’ve put it in 
eight or 10 rooms, and around half a 
dozen bookcases and cabinets. Crown 
can go in any space, from the kitchen 
to the den, and of all the interior trim 
found in a home, none attracts more 
attention. a room with crown perched 
high at the wall and ceiling junction has 
an eye-catching focal point that a 
savvy realtor will point out along with 
granite counters and marble baths.
this job’s 4½-inch crown came 
from a local lumberyard—still the 
best place for a wide-profile selection. 
I splurged on clear pine at $2.70 a 
linear foot. If I intended to paint the 
crown, I could have gotten preprimed 
finger-jointed pine for $1.60—and I’d 
be able to caulk over stray gaps 
before painting.
Installing crown is a bit trickier than 
other trim because it requires cutting 
compound angles. Plus, out-of-square 
corners and bulging, wavy walls can 
be a nightmare for a novice. but over 
the course of a dozen jobs, I’ve come 
up with a few shortcuts—I don’t really 
remember where I learned a lot of 
these tricks, I just know them.

Site Prep 
 Crown molding is usually nailed to 
the wall studs along the bottom edge 
and into the ceiling joists above—a lot 
of stud-finder work. I skip all that by 
installing a plywood backer board to the 
top plate (the horizontal 
framing member above the 
wall studs). That method 
allowed me to nail this proj-
ect’s 4½-inch crown to any 
point along every wall. 
To determine the width 
of the backer board, I held a 
piece of crown molding 
against the inside corner of 
a framing square and drew a 
line along the crown’s back 
(1). The diagonal line, minus 
1/8-inch for clearance, is the 
width of the backer board. I 
used a table saw with the 
blade set to 45 degrees to 
rip the backer boards from 
¾-inch plywood, then fas-
tened each board to the top 
plate with 3-inch drywall 
screws spaced 16 to 24 inches apart. 
Saw Shortcut
 The power miter saw and stand 
provide a safe, quick and accurate way 
to execute precise cuts. Choose a 10- 
or 12-inch saw with a dust-collection 
bag or exhaust port for attaching a wet/
dry vacuum. Select a stand with an inte-
gral power strip and extendable arms to 
support lengths of molding. The Crafts-
man rig that I used included a 12-inch 
dual-bevel compound miter saw ($350)
and a pro-duty saw stand ($250). 
There are two ways to cut crown: 
Either lay it flat beneath the blade, or 
set it against the saw at the angle, the 
way it will be installed between the wall 
and ceiling. I prefer the latter. The flat 
method requires adjusting the saw 
blade to make both a bevel and miter 
cut; my way, the saw table acts as the 
ceiling, the fence is the wall, and an 
upside-down piece of crown can be cut 
at a compound angle with a simple 
45-degree vertical chop. 
To hold the crown in place, it helps to 
The Setup
1. Trace the crown’s 
rear to plan a backer 
board—installed 
between wall and 
ceiling, this board 
acts as a mount for 
the crown.
2. Clamp a board 
to the miter saw 
to create a simple, 
consistent way to 
hold crown in place 
as each piece is cut.
3. The cleat, with its 
middle cut away, 
holds inverted 
crown in the saw 
at an angle. Placing 
the molding in the 
saw this way allows 
simple vertical 
chops to create the 
compound angles 
necessary for the 
installation.
Straight Runs
4. Connect straight 
runs with scarf 
joints, which mate 
side-by-side pieces 
in a discreet seam. 
Fasten it by firing 
2-inch finish nails  
or hand-nail 2-inch 
6d nails.
clamp a cleat to the saw table. To set 
this up, I first clamped a length of mold-
ing with its edges flush against the saw’s 
vertical fence and horizontal table. I 
pressed a 30-inch, straight-edged board 
tight against the crown and clamped it 
to the table (2). This piece, the cleat, 
stayed in place between cuts, so I could 
easily drop each piece of crown into posi-
tion. I cut away the center of the cleat by 
making a left-hand and a right-hand 
45-degree miter cut, opening a channel 
for the blade to pass through (3). 
Straight Runs
 Most crown comes in 16-foot 
lengths, so unless you’re trimming out a 
gymnasium, a single piece can usually 
span each wall. When it can’t, two 
lengths join end to end in a scarf joint 
(4). This combines opposing compound-
angle miters in a clean, nearly undetect-
able seam. Molding can shrink or shift 
out of position slightly—with a scarf 
joint, as opposed to a square-edged 
butt joint, a gap won’t appear at the 
seam. To form a scarf joint, I made a 
1

compound-angle miter cut on the end 
of one length of crown. I nailed the 
crown to the backer board and then 
made an opposing compound-angle 
miter cut onto the end of the mating 
length of crown. After applying a little 
wood glue to the joint, I slid the second 
piece of crown into position and nailed 
it to the backer board.
Inside Corners
 A coped joint connects two pieces 
of crown molding at an inside room 
corner. I prefer this type of joint over a 
miter joint because wall corners are 
rarely perfectly 90 degrees. A coped 
joint, in which a piece of crown is tai-
lored to fit an adjacent profile’s curves, 
makes a tight-fitting seam 
even if the inside corner is 
out of square—as many are. 
I cut the first length of 
crown with a square end, 
pushed it tight into the 
corner and nailed it in place. 
Then, I cut a compound-angle 
miter into the end of the 
mating length of crown (1). 
Next, I used a coping saw to 
back-cut the molding along 
its contoured profile (2). The 
idea is to saw away enough wood 
to allow the coped cut to fit tight 
against the profile of the first piece of 
crown. After cutting, the coped piece 
needed a little fine-tuning before it 
fit snugly. I smoothed the coped joint 
with rat-tail, half-round and flat files, as 
well as a wood dowel wrapped in 
80-grit sandpaper (3). 
Outside Corners
 Outside wall corners are seldom 
perfectly square, so simply cutting both 
crown pieces to 45 degrees usually 
won’t cause them to meet snugly at 
the corner. A technique that I’ve used 
for years measures perfect outside 
miter joints, regardless of the wall  
angle. I hold two overlapping 20-inch-
long 1 x 4s against the ceiling at the cor-
ner. I trace both edges of the bottom 
board onto the top board (4), then draw 
a diagonal line to connect the two

an opposing miter cut—at the same 
angle—into the end of the mating piece 
of crown. With the first piece of the 
crown’s end sitting flush with the wall 
corner, I drill a pilot hole and hand-nail  
it to the backer board with 1½-inch 4d 
finish nails (fired nails can deflect and 
break through the face of the molding). 
I add wood glue to the joint, slide the 
mating piece of crown into place (6) and 
nail it to the backer board. 
PM
Inside Corners
1. Cut a square-
ended section on 
the miter saw and 
slide it into the 
corner. Cut the 
second piece at a 
45-degree angle.
2. Use a coping saw 
to cut away the 
back of the second 
piece of molding, so 
that it can conform 
to the profile of the 
square-ended piece.
3. Fine-tune the 
coped molding by 
sanding it with a 
dowel rod wrapped 
in 80-grit paper.

4. To make accurate 
cuts on out-of-
square walls, start 
by tracing the edges 
of two 1 x 4s. Con-

pieces along the 
connecting line.

marks. Then I stack the 1 x 4s on the 
miter-saw table, adjust the saw blade 
angle to match the diagonal line and cut 
the 1 x 4s (5). I test-fit the 1 x 4s by hold-
ing them against the outside corner and 
checking the seam. If their edges don’t 
make tight, even contact, I adjust the 
saw for a second cut. When the 1 x 4s 
fit on the wall, I lock the saw-blade angle 
and make a cut into one of the lengths 
of crown. Then I adjust the saw to make

Leaking Skylights
My skylight leaks. I replaced the 
window well and sealed the flashing 
and it still leaks occasionally at one 
corner. What could be the problem?
If it were my house, I’d remove the sky-
light and replace it with a new one. 
Repeated leaks are a sign of faulty instal-
lation or damage.
A skylight can be installed in one of 
two ways: above the roof deck on a small 
curb or set into the deck. The former 
method is best used on shallow roofs or 
when the skylight is positioned near a 
wall that meets the roof. By elevating the 
skylight, the curb makes it less vulnera-
ble to leakage caused by water that 
accumulates on the roof or that runs off 
a sidewall. Flush-mounted skylights are 
typically installed on steeper roofs. 
Before purchasing a skylight, you 
might want to visit the manufacturer’s 
website and make sure it offers detailed 
installation instructions. 
adhesive (not woodworker’s glue or any 
other adhesive) on the back of the lami-
nate and on the panel’s face (the A 
veneer side, if it’s plywood). Let the adhe-
sive on both pieces dry. Next, place a row 
of ¼-inch-diameter dowel rods on the 
adhesive side of the panel and place the 
laminate in position on the rods. Slide 
the dowels out, and bring the two adhe-
sive surfaces into contact. Press the 
laminate down firmly or work over it with 
a roller. Finally, use a router and flush 
trim bit to cut away excess laminate.
A few things to keep in mind. First, it 
takes some planning to conceal the 
panel’s mounting screws and to ensure 
that the panel face is flush to the dry-
wall. It’s easiest to mount the back-
splash before the cabinets are installed. 
That way you can hide the mounting 
screws behind the cabinets. Also, you 
have any number of patterns and thick-
nesses to choose from. There is a verti-
cal grade of laminate, designed for 
backsplash applications, that is slightly 
thinner than laminate designed for hori-
zontal counter applications. The vertical 
type is easier to cut.
Finally, if the backsplash is mounted 
over switches and outlets that are 
already installed in a drywall surface, 
you’ll need a piece of hardware called a 
box extender. The extender is a sleeve 
that mounts over the electrical box, and 
it covers the gap created by the thick-
ness of the backsplash panel. It’s far 
easier to install an extender than to try 
and move the electrical box forward so 
that its edge is flush with the surface of 
the backsplash.
Carpet as Insulation
We’re tearing out a houseful of 
carpet. Can we recycle any of it as 
attic insulation?
I wouldn’t. Yes, it’s likely that carpet 
would provide some insulation benefits, 
but it’s also likely it will disintegrate 
from the intense attic heat. Besides 
that, if you go to sell the property some-
day, a home inspector will surely flag 
the “insulation,” and the prospective 
owner will demand its removal.
Still, you’re raising a question that 
lots of people are asking: Why isn’t car-
pet more easily recycled? The carpet 
industry estimates that roughly 5 billion 
pounds of carpet end up in landfills each 
year. A nonprofit group called CARE 
(Carpet America Recovery Effort) has 
been formed to divert some of the 
waste stream and convert it into useful 
materials, such as decking, flooring, 
composite lumber and reinforcing fibers 
for concrete. There are carpet reclama-
tion centers sprinkled around the coun-
try, but most are designed to take car-
pet from commercial sources, not 
homeowners. Furthermore, many of 
these companies charge from 5 cents 
to 25 cents a pound to take the 
material, which typically weighs 4 to 5 
pounds per square yard.
If you manage to find a reclamation 
or flooring company that will work with 
you, don’t just show up with a pickup-
truck load. Some older carpets with jute 
backing are difficult to reclaim. “Your 
best bet is to bring in a small carpet 
sample and some padding first,” advises 
Jeremy Krasny, owner of Western New 
York Professional Flooring in Cheektow-

Foundation Gyration
We have clay soil where we 
live in Alabama, and when it 
dries out, big cracks form in 
the soil and sometimes 
foundations move. Severe 
cracks developed in our 
neighbor’s foundation, and we 
want to be sure the same 
thing doesn’t happen to us. 
What should we do?
It sounds like your house is 
located in a region with a high 
concentration of something 
known as expansive clay, a type 
of soil that can heave sidewalks 
and crack foundations. It causes 
millions of dollars in property 
damage every year, yet the phe­
nomenon is little known to lay­
men outside the areas where it 
occurs (mostly in the southern 
and western U.S.). 
The culprit is a clay with a 
molecular structure that 
attracts water molecules, caus­
ing the clay to expand dramati­
cally—sometimes to two or 
three times its normal volume. 
Then, as the soil dries out, it 
contracts just as severely. 
The best thing you can do is 
to keep the soil’s moisture at an 
even, optimal level, and you’ll 
need some expert advice to find 
out what that level is. It can vary 
depending on the site, soil con­
ditions in the region and the 
amount of rainfall your area 
experiences. For example, a tree 
can shade a site and prevent 
rapid drying of the soil (a good 
thing) or its roots can be long 
enough to press against a foun­
dation and pull moisture from 
the soil or clog a footing drain (a 
bad thing). Only someone who 
is an expert on local conditions 
will know whether you should 
keep the tree or fell it. They may 
advise digging a test pit to see if 
the tree’s roots are encroaching 
on the foundation wall. Before 
you do anything, consult a civil

People don’t usually turn 
to late-night comedy 
shows for home-improve-
ment advice, but The Daily 
Show with Jon Stewart 
recently weighed in on 
roofing materials when 
U.S. Secretary of Energy 
Steven Chu extolled the 
virtues of reflective or 
“cool” roofs. 
“When you’re thinking 
of putting on a new roof, 
make it white,” Chu said. 
He cited research by 
Hashem Akbari at the 
Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory, which 
found that white or 
light-colored rooftops 
reflected enough sunlight 
from a building to trim 
air-conditioning bills by as 
much as 20 percent. So 
should all Americans start 
planning to replace their 
roofs? Not necessarily. 
The savings generated 
by a cool roof won’t equal 
the costs of re-roofing, 
Akbari says, so the step 
should really only be 
p H o t o g R A p H B y  A L A m y
considered for new roofs, 
or for aging roofs already 
due to be replaced. 
Flat-roofed commercial 
structures gain the 
greatest benefit from going 
white because they directly 
reflect sunlight, Akbari 
says—pitched house roofs 
don’t reflect light as 
effectively, and buildings 
with vented, insulated 
attics already prevent 
rooftop heat from 
transferring to the 
conditioned spaces below.
But the science is 
sound, even in places with 
light a/c loads. tim Leonard 
of ERSystems, a roofing 
manufacturer in minnesota, 
compared summer savings 
for white roofs against the 
energy saved when a dark 
roof absorbs solar heat in 
winter. White roofs won, 
with four to five times as 
much money saved, even 
so far north. “It’s not until 
you get up into Canada that 
the cost benefit starts to 
even out,” Leonard says.
California has mandated 
cool roofs since 2005, and 
more recently, Chicago 
enacted new standards 
requiring reflective roofs. 
Those rules have helped 
create a list of compli-
ant products, available 
at cityofchicago.org. 
Cutting one-fifth of a/c 
costs usually won’t save 
a whole lot of money. But 
for homeowners ready to 
re-roof, the savings should 
cover the price to switch. 
on Chicago’s list, light 
shingles cost little or no 
more than dark ones.

ence. In some regions, foundation-
repair companies handle this work. 
Common sense can also go a long 
way in preventing problems. For exam-
ple, if you notice the soil has dried out 
near the foundation and a gap has 
opened around it, don’t hose down the 
area, flooding it in an attempt to 
moisten the soil and close the gap. 
This can cause water to run down the 
foundation wall and erode soil away 
from it, enlarging the gap in the pro-
cess and perhaps even undermining 
the building’s footings. Instead, if a 
long dry spell is forecast, run sprinklers 
on the lawn (about 4 feet from the 
foundation) to keep the soil moist. pm

speed sensors used by the antilock 
brake system. If all four tires are prop-
erly inflated, they will all rotate the same 
number of revolutions in a stretch of 
road. If one tire rotates more than the 
other three, it has a shorter rolling 
radius because the pressure in it is low. 
The indirect type of system is inex-
pensive, because the only real part that 
must be added to a car is the display  
on the dash and some extra code in 
the vehicle’s operating system. Properly 
inferring tire pressures this way can be  
a problem when the tires are unevenly 
worn, or if you replace only two worn 
tires instead of all four. You can reset the 
system to allow for wear when all the 
tire pressures are correct. The procedure 
varies from vehicle to vehicle, and this 
one won’t necessarily work on yours. 
Persistent TPMS warnings can often be 
cured by setting the tire pressures prop-
erly and then resetting the TPMS some-
where in the menu on the driver’s display, 
or perhaps with a scan tool. If the system 
isn’t reset this way, TPMS warning lights 
will also crop up after a normal tire rota-
tion, or if you’re replacing tires with ones 
of a different size from the old ones.
The Better Way
 There is a much better (read: more 
expensive) technology to monitor 
tire pressures. Higher-end vehicles use 
a direct-reading system of battery-
powered senders mounted inside the 
tire, communicating with the TPMS by 
means of small antennas in each wheel 
well. Every few minutes, the TPMS 
will interrogate the senders in the 
wheels, acquire a “true” pressure read-
ing and transfer the message to the 
in-car display. 
seat. The desert beckons, and 40 miles 
of heat-shimmered asphalt later, a tire 
blows. What happened?
After swapping in the spare, you 
continue your trip at a more sedate 
pace. The TPMS light is on, and you 
stay well under the speed limit until  
you can check the 
tire pressures with 
a gauge. Surprise—
they’re all low. Sur-
prise No. 2: The TPMS 
light remains on after 
you top off the tires 
to the correct pres-
sure, at least until  
you can get a replace-
ment tire mounted 
later in your trip.
Be Prepared
 A Department of
Transportation study 
dating back to 2001 
says that 60 to 80 per-
cent of cars on the 
road are running tires 
underinflated by as 
much as 10 percent. 
Worse yet, they say 
that 20 to 50 percent 
are being driven with 
tires down in pressure by as much as 20 
percent. Yet, here’s the scariest part: If 
your tires are low, even falling into that 
minus 20 percent category, your TPMS 
won’t tell you—ever. The TPMS warning 
light is only required to illuminate when 
the pressure gets 25 percent below the 
correct value, which is enough to reduce 
fuel economy, lower the available grip 
(especially in wet conditions) and make 
tires run substantially hotter.
Bottom line: Don’t trust the TPMS. 
Once you understand how your TPMS 
system works, you’ll understand why it 
doesn’t obviate the need for regular 
tire-pressure monitoring. 
The Easy Way
 There are two types of TPMS on 
the market, direct-reading and indirect. 
Indirect systems use only software and 
readouts from the individual wheel-
P M  D I Y  A U T O  /// T P M s
In an attempt to 
reduce the sensor’s 
mass and keep the 
wheel in balance, 
the metal stem of 
the sender is 
commonly made  
of aluminum. Soft 
aluminum. Use a 
torque wrench on 
the inch-pound 
scale to tighten 
these, because it’s 
really easy to strip 
the threads by 
overtightening. 
Ferrous-metal valve 
caps may interfere 
with the electron-
ics, so stick with 
OEM-style plastic 
valve-stem caps.
TPMS senders are 
usually attached to 
the valve stem, 
although some are 
banded to the 
wheel’s drop center. 
These units can cost 
over $100, but 
replacements for 
most domestics can 
be found on the 
aftermarket for $50 
or less. They’re 
prone to damage 
from tire-mounting 
machines, so get 
your tires mounted 
by a knowledgeable 
technician.

And all of this has to happen within 
2 minutes, or the learn mode times out 
and you’ll have to start over. Also, if any-
one nearby is adjusting tire pressures 
on a car with TPMS sensors, the sys-
tem may be confused. If your vehicle’s 
TPMS includes the spare, burrow into 
the trunk and get access to the spare 
first. Don’t forget to top off the tires to 
the correct pressure.
On some GM cars you can activate 
the wheel sensors with a simple, power-
ful horseshoe magnet. GM has a special 
tool for this, but I’ll bet a nice strong 
magnet from RadioShack would work. 
On Toyotas, apparently the only way to 
activate the sensors is with the Toyota 
TPMS tool or scan tool. Your mileage 
may vary. You’ll need to find out exactly 
what procedure your vehicle needs any 
time you rotate tires or install winter 
tires. Consult your owner’s manual, or 
the factory service manual. Be wary of 
advice on TPMS from enthusiast web-
sites: A lot of the procedures I saw there 
were wrong or just plain out-of-date.
Special Considerations
 If you ever need to replace a valve-
stem core, use stainless steel rather 
than brass to avoid corrosion. It’s one 
thing to replace a $2 rubber valve stem 
and something else 
entirely to replace a 
$100 TPMS sensor. 
And always use that 
cap. Water, road salt 
or mud could affect 
the sensor. 
One last thing: That 
can of aerosol flat-fixer 
in your trunk may dam-
age the sensor. Yes, it 
says “Sensor Safe” on 
the label, but experi-
ence in the field says 
it’s a bad idea. The 
hole-filling compound 
may well plug up the 
hole in the sensor that 
checks pressure. If you 
must use one of these 
products, take the vehi-
cle to a properly trained 
tire technician as soon 
as possible to have the 
hole plugged properly 
from the inside.

But what’s to keep the system from 
reporting the tire pressure of the car 
next to you at a traffic light? In order to 
keep things straight, the individual 
senders have a unique serial number to 
transmit to the vehicle. And that keeps 
individual wheels on each corner of the 
car properly sorted in the TPMS’s tiny 
little brain. On many vehicles, there’s 
even a sender on the spare tire. The 
TPMS is initialized with the position of 
the four (or five) tires when the car is 
new. Eventually, those tires could 
change position, through normal tire 
rotation or as the result of a flat. That’s 
why there is a procedure to resynchro-
nize the system. For most vehicles, it 
involves the use of a special tool that 
communicates with the vehicle and  
the sender to make everybody play 
nice. This device knows which wheel  
is which because it’s held next to each 
valve stem in turn as the system is  
programmed. Your car dealer will have 
one, and some independent repair 
shops might as well. Unfortunately, 
they’re different for 
every brand of car, and 
they cost plenty, with 
basic models going  
for $600 to $800, and 
those that work on a 
variety of vehicles run-
ning up to $2500. 
Fortunately, it’s 
rarely necessary to use 
the factory-style tool. 
Each manufacturer has 
its own tool and proce-
dure. Look in (surprise!) 
the owner’s manual. 
P M  D I Y  A U T O  /// T p m s
Tire pressure 
should be 
checked in the 
morning on cold 
tires, not after 
you’ve driven  
to Starbucks. 
Tire pressure 
changes 1 psi  
for every  
10 degrees of 
outside tempera-
ture. A change 
from 70 F to 
40 F will lower 
the pressure 3 
psi, enough to 
affect wet 
braking and fuel 
economy; check 
your pressures 
monthly. 
The definitive 
correct tire pressure 
is on this sticker on 
the door frame. This 
info is also in the 
owner’s manual. 
Ignore what’s 
printed on the tire 
sidewall. Your car 
manufacturer has 
determined what 
pressures will make 
your car handle 
properly. The 
pressure on the 
sidewall is the 
maximum pressure 
for any vehicle.
Here’s a typical  
procedure for teaching the TPMS 
system which wheel is which:
1. Place the ignition switch in the 
“ACC” position.
2. Simultaneously press the keyless 
entry transmitter’s lock and unlock 
buttons until a horn chirp sounds. This 
will put the system in “learn mode.”
3. Starting with the left front tire, 
increase/decrease the tire pressure for 
5 to 8 seconds, then wait for a horn 
chirp. The horn chirp may occur before 
the 5-to-8-second pressure increase/
decrease time period has been 
reached, or up to 30 seconds  
after the 5-to-8-second pressure 
increase/decrease time period has 
been reached.
4. After a horn chirp has sounded, 
proceed as in step 3 for the next three 
sensors in the following order:  right 
front, right rear, left rear.
5. After the LR sensor has been 
learned, a double horn chirp will 
sound, indicating that all sensors  
have been learned.

I’ve owned a few “magnetic” 
screwdrivers in my career. Usually 
these have been gifts that one of my 
well-meaning friends or relatives has 
given me as a token of their esteem. 
Most of the time, they’re a big pain. The 
magnet makes the tip stick to stuff 
besides the screw head, ruining your 
aim. they often have replaceable tips, 
held in place by the magnet, and the tip 
has a tendency to stay attached to the 
fastener rather than remaining in the 
screwdriver’s shank. In fact, I found a 
magnetic torx bit still attached to a 
bolt just last week. as far as I can 
remember, I left it in my toolbox over a 
year ago. There are a bunch of ways to 
aid and abet your aim when installing 
fasteners in tough-to-reach places. a
little masking tape or duct tape on the 
end of the screwdriver is a good solu-
tion. I’ve also used weatherstrip adhe-
sive. In fact, that’s what NaSCar
teams use to secure lug nuts onto rims 
before wheels are installed. So when 
it’s time for a tire change, the mechanic 
can simply throw the wheel and tire 
onto the hub and rattle the lug nuts 
tight one-handed with an air wrench.

My son has been stationed in 
Baghdad for over six months. He 
owns a 2007 Ford 
Escape V6 with 34,000 
miles, which has been at a 
Ford dealership since last winter. 
They say it has a failed catalytic 
converter, which (to the best of my 
understanding) caused the engine to 
drop a rod through the oil pan. Since 
he is overseas, a Ford rep is keeping 
me “updated” by phone. They replaced 
the engine but are unable to find a 
converter, claiming the parts supplier 
went bankrupt. On the other hand,  
I have no problem finding converters 
advertised online. It’s been 9 months! 
Now small parts

to a hard floor 
knocks the mag-

out of alignment 
and kills the

My son is due home soon, and still no 
vehicle. Is Ford putting us on?
Ford has had difficulties keeping the 
Escape converter supply chain, partly 
because of a sketchy supplier, but also 
because of a lot of plugged converters. 
Continued operation with a plugged con-
verter builds so much heat and back 
pressure, it can ultimately take out the 
bottom end of the engine. But I dare say 
you’ve been waiting longer than most.
Six months is way too long for a car 
to be down, regardless of whether your 
son is on deployment and doesn’t really 
need it. It’s time to start researching 
your state’s lemon laws. Because the 
vehicle has been out of service so long, 
the dealership will almost certainly have 
to buy it back, if you make the right nois-
es. Mind you, the deal will include paying 
Ford for the mileage that has accumu-
lated, which often means the outcome 
probably won’t be a bargain. Usually, just 
threatening to invoke the lemon law 
(which starts with arbitration, not court) 
makes the dealership get off the 
dime and either fix the vehicle 
or find a replacement. I suggest you dis-
cuss this with your attorney.
Don’t Give Me Any Static
When I turn on the rear-window 
defroster, I hear static on my radio. I 
now notice static when I use the air 
conditioning too. Is there something 
common between both systems that 
may be causing this?
Fifteen years ago, the 
auto industry was forced to 
drop CFC-based refrigerant 
R-12 because of its liability 
for ozone depletion. They 
switched to non-CFC-based 
R-134a, which, as it turned 
out, also provided a substan-
tial reduction in greenhouse 
gas liability. How much better 
is R-134a? Carbon dioxide 
has a global warming rating 
of 1. R-12 has a rating of 
12,000. In other words, one 
pound of R-12 has the 
equivalent effect on global 
warming as 6 tons—12,000 
pounds —of CO2. Years ago, 
that made R-134a’s rating of 
1400 seem like a better deal. 
(As a point of reference, it 
takes one or two pounds of 
CO2 to dispense an entire keg 
of beer). But now automakers 
are considering a new 
refrigerant for worldwide 
use— R-1234yf. This new 
refrigerant has a global-warm-
ing impact number of just 4.
There is no intent to 
retrofit R-134a systems with 
the new R-1234yf, in the way 
many R-12 systems were 
haphazardly converted to 
R-134a. R-134a will remain 
available to service existing 
systems, and R-1234yf 
systems will use specific 
fittings, which should 
minimize accidental mixing of 
the two refrigerants. 
R-1234yf is slightly less 
efficient than R-134a. Of 
course, R-134a is less 
efficient than R-12, and auto 
manufacturers had to modify 
and upgrade systems to 
maintain good cooling 
performance when the last 
changeover was mandated. 
They’ll need to do so again.
R-1234yf will first appear 
in all-new European vehicles, 
so we might see some 
R-1234yf systems here by 
late 2011, with significant 
numbers starting in 2012.
Although R-134a 
continues to be available in 
small cans to DIYers, 
California will soon require 
self-sealing can valves and 
large deposit fees to 
encourage recycling of any 
leftover refrigerant in partially 
used cans. Whether 
R-1234yf will also be 
available in small cans is 
uncertain. Pro technicians are 
legally required to recover, 
recycle and reuse all auto a/c 
refrigerants. And that means 
that repair shops will have to 
purchase yet another 
expensive recycling machine 
for R-1234yf and inventory a 
larger collection of fittings 
and replacement parts, costs 
ultimately passed on to 
consumers.  — Paul Weissler

a decent digital multimeter.
1. Set the meter to read “AC

2. Connect the black “COM”  
lead probe tip to the battery 
negative post.
3. Connect the red “VOLTS”  
lead probe tip to the battery 
positive post.
4. Run the engine at 1500 rpm.
5. Turn on the a/c and

6. Your meter reading  
should not exceed 0.09

just swap in a rebuilt alternator 
if one is available fairly

Check the dipstick. Does the oil smell 
like unburned fuel? It’s likely that the 
dripping fuel is washing past the rings 
and into the crankcase. Run the car for 
long enough to get the engine hot. Then 
park it for 2 hours or so, until it cools off 
and you know it will be hard to start. 
Crank the engine for a few seconds and 
immediately shut it off. Then pull the 
plugs. I’ll bet one of them is wet with 
fuel—and that’s your bad injector. If you 
need proof, swap two injectors, and the 
fouled plug will follow. 
Another check is to put a pressure 
gauge on the fuel rail, and see if it holds 
residual pressure after shutoff. If it does, 
then the injectors aren’t leaking down. 
Gear Jammin’
A while ago the transmission on my 
pickup became difficult to shift, as if 
the gears wanted to clash. This 
condition would go away and then 
return for several weeks at a time. 
One day, I could not shift into gear at 
all. Only by double-clutching the 
transmission was I sometimes able to 
with a small AC ripple. Most of the time, 
the battery will still provide clean DC. 
But turn on a large power consumer 
like the a/c or defroster—20 amps or 
more—and the current available to the 
radio acquires a sawtooth shape, and 
you’ve got buzzing.
Wet Injector
I have a 1985 Honda CRX Si with a 
1.5-liter fuel-injected engine.  
The problem: It restarts poorly and 
runs roughly, at least if I try to  
restart before it sits for 12 to 18 
hours or more. It cranks over fine but 
takes a few seconds to fire up. If I 
hold the throttle open it helps the  
car to start quicker. The fuel injectors 
are rebuilt and balanced and said not 
to be leaking down. The coolant-­ 
temp sending unit is new, the 
air-temp sending unit is new, and 
there are no warning lights. I have a 
new fuel pump, a new oxygen sensor 
and a clean air filter too. Once the 
engine starts, it runs roughly for 10 to 
15 seconds, then smooths out and 
runs great. Holding the pedal down to 
the floor seems to help. Note: In very 
cold weather, say 32 degrees or 
below, it always starts fine. No one 
has yet been able to diagnose the 
trouble successfully.
In spite of your assertion that the injec-
tors don’t leak, this sounds like a leaky 
injector is fuel-fouling one cylinder. After 
you tease the engine to life on the other 
three cylinders, the extra fuel evaporates 
and then the plug starts firing. There are 
two tipoffs that this is the problem: the 
rough running until the wet plug dries off 
and starts to contribute, and the fact 
that waiting a half-day or more lets the 
excess fuel dissipate on its own. If you 
wait long enough before trying to 
restart, the extra fuel evaporates. Crank-
ing with the throttle open makes the 
excess fuel dissipate quicker.

through the center of the 
clutch disc and into a bearing 
at the center of the flywheel. 
When that bearing fails, it 
tries to spin the tranny input 
shaft even when the clutch 
pedal is depressed and the 
transmission and drivetrain are 
supposed to be disengaged 
from the engine.
However—you say that the 
transmission was engaged 
even in neutral. The viscosity of 
the lubricant in the transmis-
sion will make the rear wheels 
spin weakly in neutral when the 
engine is idling, but I assume 
you mean that the wheels were 
locked to the engine in neutral. 
If so, you have a failed bearing 
between the transmission 
input and output shaft.
Actually, it really doesn’t 
matter. Regardless of what has 
failed, the transmission has to 
be removed to access the 
clutch, flywheel or transmis-
sion internals. Once the trans 
is out of the truck, it should be 
obvious where the problem is.

I live in Arizona and use 
87-octane regular. In Utah, 
Idaho and Nevada, stations 
were selling 85-octane as 
regular gas. This forced me to 
pay more for midgrade 
87-octane. Is this the latest 
petroleum-­industry scam to 
get more of our money? Will 
my car run okay on this bogus 
85-octane regular?
Octane is the ability of a fuel to resist 
knock, and high-compression engines 
tend to knock more. The obverse of that 
is that lower-compression engines can 
run on lower-octane gas. Air is thinner 
the higher above sea level you go. Less 
air going into the cylinders means less 
pressure at top dead center when 
things go bang. It’s a lot like lowering 
the compression ratio in the engine, 
reducing the need for high octane.  Cars 
will run just fine on lower-octane fuel 
when they’re well above sea level—and 
all of those states are. Hopefully, by the 
time you get back down to denser air, 
you’ve burned off most of the low-
octane stuff, and can refill the tank with 
higher-grade fuel.

At some point in its history, the 
humble rJ-45 Ethernet connector got 
a bad rap. Wi-Fi routers entranced us 
all with their promise of easy setup 
and constant connectivity, while wired 
Ethernet connections required a mys-
tical knowledge closely guarded by 
corporate It professionals. Now, 
we’ve got nothing against Wi-Fi—for 
devices such as smartphones and lap-
tops that put a premium on portabil-
ity, it’s the natural solution. but it turns 
out that nothing beats a hard-wired 
connection for setup simplicity, reli-

move wire from one room to the next. 
Think hard about what pieces of equip-
ment need to be networked and where 
these devices are located, and plan for 
the future; young children may eventu-
ally need connectivity in their rooms, 
networked devices will gradually find 
their way into your kitchen, and, heck, 
someday you might build that home 
theater in the basement. I even sent my 
network into my bathroom. 
Remember, your network diagram 
begins with your broadband modem, 
then progresses to a router, which serves 
as the traffic manager for your entire 
network. If you already have a Wi-Fi 
hotspot in your house, keep in mind that 
many of these devices do double duty  
as wired routers, and typically have four 
RJ-45 ports on 
the back for wired 
network connec-
tions. Past the 
router, you can 
use simple Ether-
net switches to 
split your network 
into as many 
branches as you 
wish. Switches 
can have any-
where from four 
to 48 ports, and 
are far less com-
plex than rout-
ers—setup is as 
easy as plugging 
the switch into an 
electrical outlet, 
then plugging in 
operate far more slowly), whereas wired 
connections can shuttle data around at 
up to 1000 Mbps, or 1 gigabit per sec-
ond, consistently—great for bandwidth- 
hogging HD video streaming. Plus, 
wired Ethernet gear requires no pass-
words, encryption or complex alpha-
numeric keys to set up—all the equip-
ment is plug-and-play. 
Meanwhile, the home network is 
evolving from a novelty to a necessity. 
Many families now have multiple com-
puters as well as a constellation of 
connected devices such as game sys-
tems, network-attached storage drives, 
printers, security cameras and media 
players. Some of these have Wi-Fi con-
nectivity, but almost all of them have an 
RJ-45 Ethernet jack built in. These net-
worked devices are swiftly colonizing 
every room in the house. Just as phone 
jacks and coaxial cable connections 
have evolved to become standard build-
in connections during remodeling or 
new construction, Ethernet is now the 
new must-have outlet. And contrary to 
what you might expect, Ethernet is 
about as simple and inexpensive as wir-
ing gets—about $200 will cover all the 
equipment and supplies you need for 
an entire house. 
Beneath the Sheath
 It’s easy to see why people are 
intimidated by Ethernet cable. Slice open 
the exterior plastic sheath and eight tiny 
multicolored wires spill out like a many-
headed hydra. And the variety of cable 
standards is downright inscrutable: CAT 
5, CAT 5e, CAT 6, CAT 6a and so on. Cat-
egory 5, or CAT 5, cable is used for basic 
10/100 Mbps networking, while CAT 5e 
and CAT 6 can support gigabit equip-
ment known as 1000 Base T. But CAT 6 
is necessary to support the less widely 
used 1000 Base TX gear, while CAT 6a 
cable supports corporate-level network-
ing gear at speeds up to 10 Gbps. 
Sounds confusing, but the average 
homeowner will be fine with CAT 5e (the 
“e” stands for enhanced), which supports 
all the most common consumer equip-
ment and can carry signal to a maximum 
cable distance of 330 feet. If you’re wir-
ing an entire house, you’ll want to buy 
your cable in bulk. Online retailer Sewell 
Direct sells a soup-to-nuts kit, including 
1000 feet of CAT 5e, a stripping/crimp-
ing tool and 100 connectors, for $85. 
Of course, when you buy bulk cable, 
you’re going to have to attach the con-
nectors yourself, but there’s no advanced 
degree required for crimping. Just follow 
the U.S. standard wiring code (known as 
T568B). From left to right, align the 
wires—orange stripe, solid orange, green 
stripe, solid blue, blue stripe, solid green, 
brown stripe, solid brown—then slide 
them into the connector (clip side down) 
and crimp with your crimping tool. 
Sound too complicated? Here’s a dirty 
little secret of the Ethernet world: Even 
if you get the order of the wiring wrong, 
it doesn’t matter—so long as your wiring 
is consistent on both ends, the signal  
will go through.
Plan Your Route
 But before you start stringing wire 
all over your house and potentially tear-
ing up your walls, do a little detective 
work. Look around the house for pre-
existing holes and pathways that will 
help you route the wire more easily. 
Draw out a rough blueprint for your 
house and plot the most efficient rout-
ing path for your network—use your 
attic, basement and/or crawlspaces to

all of your Ethernet cords, like an electri-
cal power strip for networking. That said, 
routers and switches are powered digital 
devices, so some locations—basements, 
attics and closets—may get too hot or 
too damp, or may not have an easily 
accessible electrical outlet. 
as to the specifics of routing signal 
cable such as Cat 5e or Cat 6, check 
local building codes, but with low-voltage 
wiring there generally aren’t many restric-
tions. From my experience, however, 
it’s a good idea to space any Ethernet 
wall outlets at least 1 foot from electrical 
boxes to avoid interference. 
and when you get around to actually 
installing your cable, standard wiring 
procedure applies: use a stud finder to 
plan around your framing. if you are 
installing in an existing wall, use an old-
work electrical box or low-voltage 
bracket and mount a network faceplate 
to it, then fish the wires through the 
wall to your outlet using a drop chain or 
fish tape. if drilling holes, snaking wires, 
and mounting outlets and boxes 
throughout the house doesn’t appeal to 
you, do what the cable companies do 
and run the cables through closets and 
along your baseboards.
When you are done, don’t forget to 
keep a stock of extra cable, connectors 
and tools, as you may end up extending 
or reconfiguring the network as your 
needs grow. Plus, once you show your 
friends and family that there’s no need 
to fear the rJ-45 connector, they may 
want to borrow a bit of your mystical it
knowledge—and all of your extra sup-
plies, of course.

Camera 
Dust-Busting
 Q
My digital SLR photos are plagued with  
 annoying dots that seem to pop up in the 
same place in every photo. I did some research 
and suspect they are caused by dust on my 
camera’s image sensor. How can I clean it?
A
Digital SLR cameras with inter-
changeable lenses are highly 
versatile, but they have a unique vul-
nerability: When the lens is removed, 
the door is open for dust to float into 
the camera’s body and cling to the 
electrically charged image sensor 
within. Once there, these tiny specs 
of dust can pollute your photos with 
annoying, image-ruining artifacts that 
usually pop up in the same place from 
photo to photo. Freckles, some pho-
tographers call them.
To combat this problem, digital 
SLR manufacturers have begun to 
build cameras with the ability to clean 
their own sensors. This is typically 
done through a vibration mechanism—
the sensor literally shakes the dust 
loose. But if your camera can’t do 
this, or if you aren’t inclined to spend 
the time and money needed to send 
it to a professional service center for 
cleaning, it may be prudent to do the 
dust-busting yourself.
There are a number of ways to 
clean an image sensor, but it’s impor-
tant to take it easy. Camera sensors 
are extremely fragile, and while some 
of the more aggressive cleaning meth-
ods may certainly rid the sensor of 
dust, they’re also likely to result in col-
lateral damage. For example, blasting 
Camera

 Don’t: Blast the

 with compressed  
 air—it can leave  
 behind a greasy film. 
 Do: Use an air  
 bulb to gently  
 blow off dust.

the sensor with compressed air can 
leave the camera’s fragile innards 
coated with a greasy film from the 
can’s accelerant.
My preferred method: Use an  
air bulb, such as the Giottos Rocket 
Blaster (pictured) or the Dot Line Hur-
ricane Blower (both cost around $10) 
to blow the dust away. These small 
rubber balls squeeze out a focused jet 
of air that is powerful enough to blow 
away most dust particles.
Before you perform the operation, 
you’ll want to find a clean, dust-free 
area to work in. Next step: Gain access 
to the sensor. To do this, you’ll need to 
remove the lens and select a menu 
function called something like “Lock 
Mirror Up for Cleaning” (the exact 
wording may differ depending on your 
camera model). When this mode is 
selected, a mirror inside the camera 
will flip up, revealing the glossy, rect-
angular sensor behind. This mode 
should also cut the dust-attracting 
electricity from the sensor, making it 
easier to remove the particles. Hold 
the bulb a few inches from the sensor 
and liberally squeeze away.
If stubborn dust specs prove 
unmoved by the air bulb, you can fol-
low up with a swab-based cleaning 
tool and specially made cleaning solu-
tion, such as the Sensor Swab ($45 
for a pack of 12) and the Photographic 
Solutions Eclipse Sensor Cleaner 
(about $10 for a 2-ounce bottle). Apply 
a small amount of the cleaning solu-
tion to the applicator stick’s swab tip 
and carefully run it across the surface 
of the sensor, much like you would run 
a squeegee over a window. Just don’t 
apply too much pressure or you could 
damage the fragile sensor.
And remember, the best offense is  
a good defense; a few precautionary 
steps can minimize the chances of 
dust seeping inside your camera in 
the first place. When you swap lenses, 
try to do it as quickly as possible, in a 
clean, dust-free room, away from any 
wind. If you must do it outside, take 
the advice of PM photographer Chad 
Hunt, who recently battled dusty con-
ditions in Afghanistan: “Dust has a 
hard time drifting straight up, so a lot 
of pro photographers hold the camera 
down when they take off the lens so 
the opening is facing the ground.”
Open Sesame
My Mac Pro tower computer 
doesn’t seem to have an eject 
button for its CD/DVD drive. 
Apparently, the button is on the 
keyboard that it came with. Trouble 
is, I don’t use that keyboard. Is there 
any other way to open the drive?
Like many Apple products, the mono-
lithic Mac Pro tower (along with some 
of its predecessors) was designed 
with as few physical buttons as pos-
sible. One element that was sacrificed 
by Apple’s designers on the altar of 
minimalism: the eject button. The 
tower doesn’t have one. Of course, 
this presents a problem for users who 
don’t use an Apple-issued keyboard or 
one of the few third-party keyboards 
with an eject button, for whom there

is simply no obvious way to 
open an empty drive. 
Thankfully, there are a num-
ber of work-arounds. One is  
to permanently install an eject 
icon in the toolbar menu situ-
ated at the top of your desktop. 
To do this, open up a Finder 
window and click “Macintosh

lowed by “Library,” “Core­

lastly, “Eject.menu.” An eject

want to remove it, just hold the

board and drag the icon off of 
the menu bar.
Another way to open the

click on “Controls,” and select 
“Eject Disc.” (There’s also a 
shortcut for this operation with-

for fingerprints. To 
combat these streaks, 
gadget manufacturers 
have begun building 
devices with so-called 
oleophobic, or oil-

The effect comes from 
an oil-averse polymer 
that is bonded to the

smears from sticking  
to the glass. They  
aren’t perfectly

because the oil simply 
sits on the surface of

The African redneck ostrich weighs 350 pounds, runs in bursts up to 40 mph and 
can eviscerate a person with a powerful kick. And last year, Pete Black had to catch 
them. “It was a rodeo at times, ” he says of the research expedition to Africa, “but no one got 
seriously injured.” Black works for the St. Louis Zoo, where his primary responsibility is to perform 
routine exams and surgeries and provide preventative care to the zoo’s 5000 animals. Black 
makes house calls to animals’ enclosures and works within the confines of the 17,000-square-
foot hospital. “A lot of the species we work with are endangered, or dangerous, or both, ” Black 
says. “Making sure things are safe for them—and for us—is challenging.”  — erin mccarthy

1. Thermal Camera   
Black snaps a photo with this 
dust- and splash-proof camera 
that senses differences in 
body temperature to deter-
mine if an animal is injured: 
The hotter the area, the more 
inflamed or infected it is.    
2. Surgical Table   
This hydraulic table can hold 
up to 1000 pounds. When he’s 
dealing with large animals, 
Black wheels the table out 
to the loading dock, puts the 
sedated animal on the table 
and takes it back to the OR. 
3. Portable X-ray   
Black can take this portable 
X-ray machine into the field, 
where a stand holds it in  
position. There is also a  
bigger, nonmobile unit in the 
hospital that provides higher 
resolution images.  
4. Portable Ultrasound   
To monitor pregnancies or 
look for injuries in the heart 
or abdomen, Black uses this 
portable ultrasound device. 
The 8-pound unit comes with 
four different transducers and 
an 8-inch color LCD display.  
5. Dart Gun   
Black uses a dart gun—loaded 
with drugs 10,000 times more 
potent than morphine—to 
sedate animals too dangerous 
to approach. 
6. Endoscopes   
The less invasive a surgical 
procedure, the more quickly an 
animal will recover. Black uses 
these flexible endoscopes, 
which are outfitted with a 
camera and have slots for 
instruments, to take biopsies 
or grab foreign objects out 
of the stomachs of animals. 
The largest is 9 feet long; the 
smallest is only 2 feet.
