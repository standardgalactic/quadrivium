Getting Started
Welcome to the official Apple Pro Training Series course for Logic Pro X. 
This book is a comprehensive introduction to professional music produc-
tion with Logic Pro X. It uses real-world music and hands-on exercises 
to teach you how to record, edit, arrange, mix, produce, and polish audio 
and MIDI files in a professional workflow. So let’s get started!
The Methodology
This book takes a hands-on approach to learning the software, so you’ll be 
working through the project files and media you download from www.peach-
pit.com. It’s divided into lessons that introduce the interface elements and ways 
of working with them, building progressively until you can comfortably grasp 
the entire application and its standard workflows.
Each lesson in this book is designed to support the concepts learned in the 
preceding lesson, and first-time readers should go through the book from start 
to finish. However each lesson is self-contained, so when you need to review a 
topic, you can quickly jump to any lesson.
The book is designed to guide you through the music production process as it 
teaches Logic. The lessons are organized into four sections.

xii    Getting Started
Lessons 1–3: Exploring the Interface and Working  
with Real Instruments
In this section, you’ll explore the fundamentals of Logic Pro X, and learn to record and 
edit audio.
Lesson 1 starts you out with an overview of the entire process. You’ll become familiar with 
the interface and the various ways to navigate a project; use Apple loops to build a song 
from scratch; and then arrange, mix, and export the song to an MP3 file.
Lessons 2 and 3 dive deeper into typical situations you may encounter when recording 
from microphones or other audio sources. You’ll edit recordings to select the best portions 
of multiple takes, remove clicks, align recordings, and even reverse a recording to create a 
special effect.
Lessons 4–6: Working with Virtual Instruments
Lesson 4 describes how to produce a virtual drummer performance using the new Drummer 
and Drum Kit Designer features. You will choose the right drummer for the project, swap a 
drum kit with the kit of another drummer, edit the patterns, change which kit elements the 
drummer plays, shape an interpretation, and precisely control where fills are placed.
Lessons 5 and 6 immerse you in using software instruments. After choosing virtual instru-
ments and recording MIDI performances, you’ll map Smart Controls to various plug-ins 
and assign them to your MIDI controller. Using the free Logic Remote app, you’ll control 
Logic from your iPad, and then create virtual performances in MIDI editors using your 
mouse or your MIDI keyboard.
Lessons 7–8: Building a Song
In Lessons 7 and 8, you’ll apply Flex editing to precisely adjust the timing and pitch of 
notes in an audio recording. Varispeed will allow you to work with your project at differ-
ent tempos. You’ll add tempo changes and tempo curves to a project, match the tempos 
of multiple tracks, and make a track follow the groove of another track. Also covered 
are tuning a vocal recording, editing a project’s regions in the workspace to complete an 
arrangement, and adding and removing sections of a project.
Lessons 9–10: Mixing and Automating a Song
Lessons 9 and 10 instruct you in mixing audio and MIDI files into a final project: adding 
audio effects, adjusting levels, panning, EQing, adding delay and reverb, automating the

time with the mouse or a MIDI controller.
Appendix A describes how to use external MIDI devices, and Appendix B lists a wealth of 
useful keyboard shortcuts.
System Requirements
Before using Apple Pro Training Series: Logic Pro X, you should have a working knowledge 
of your Mac and the Mac OS X operating system. Make sure that you know how to use 
the mouse and standard menus and commands; and also how to open, save, and close 
files. If you need to review these techniques, see the printed or online documentation 
included with your system.
Logic Pro X and the lessons in this book require the following system resources:
▶
▶
Mac computer with an Intel processor, including:
4 GB of RAM
Display with 1280 x 768 or higher resolution

Preparing Your Logic Workstation
The exercises in this book require that you install Logic Pro X along with its default media 
content. If you have not yet installed Logic, you may purchase it from the App Store. When 
your purchase is completed, Logic Pro X will automatically be installed on your hard drive.
All the instructions and descriptions in this book assume that you installed Logic Pro X 
on a Mac without any legacy Logic media, and that you downloaded all the additional 
media except for the Legacy and Compatibility content.

xiv    Getting Started
When you first open Logic Pro X, the app will automatically download and install about 2 
GB of essential content. An alert then offers to download additional media content.
Click Download Additional Content to make sure that you install all the Logic Pro X 
media content. After you click Download Additional Content, the Additional Content 
window opens. Click the Select All Uninstalled button at the bottom left, and click the 
“Legacy and Compatibility” checkbox twice to deselect it. Depending on the speed of your 
Internet connection, the download process may take several hours.
Note ▶ ​If you have already installed Logic Pro X but did not install the additional con-
tent, choose Logic Pro X > Download Additional Content, click Select All Uninstalled 
(make sure the Legacy and Compatibility content is not selected) and click Install.
www.ebook3000.com

Preparing Your Logic Workstation    xv
Note ▶ ​If you have previously installed the Legacy and Compatibility content, or if 
you have earlier versions of Logic installed on your Mac, you may not always see the 
same results as those shown in the book, especially when viewing the Library, the 
Loop Browser, or the plug-in settings menus.
Downloading and Using the Logic Lesson Files
The downloadable content for Apple Pro Training Series: Logic Pro X includes the project 
files you will use for each lesson, as well as media files that contain the audio and MIDI 
content you will need for each exercise. After you save the files to your hard disk, each les-
son will instruct you in their use.
To download these files, you must have your guide’s access code—provided on a card in 
the back of the printed editions of this book or on the “Where Are the Lesson Files?” page 
in electronic editions of this book. When you have the code:
1	
Go to www.peachpit.com/redeem, and enter your access code.
2	
Click Redeem Code, and sign in or create a Peachpit.com account.
3	
Locate the downloadable files on your Account page under the Lesson & Update Files tab.
4	
Click the lesson file link and download the file to your Mac desktop.
Note ▶ ​If you purchase or redeem a code for the electronic version of this guide 
directly from Peachpit, the lesson file link will automatically appear on the Lesson & 
Update Files tab without the need to redeem an additional code.
5	
After downloading the file to your Mac desktop, you’ll need to unzip the file to access 
a folder titled Logic Pro X Files, which you will save to your Mac desktop.
Logic Pro X Files contains two subfolders, Lessons and Media, that contain the work-
ing files for this course. Make sure you keep these two folders together in the Logic 
Pro X Files folder on your hard disk. If you do so, your Mac should be able to main-
tain the original links between the lessons and media files. Each lesson explains which 
files to open for that lesson’s exercises.

xvi    Getting Started
Using Default Preferences and Selecting the Advanced Tools
All the instructions and descriptions in this book assume that you are using the default 
preferences (unless instructed to change them) and the initialized key command preset 
for a U.S. keyboard. At the beginning of Lesson 1, you will be instructed how to show 
advanced tools and select all additional options.
If you have changed some of your Logic Pro X preferences, you may not realize the same 
results as described in the exercises. To make sure that you can follow along with this 
book, it’s best to revert to the initial set of Logic preferences before you start the lessons. 
Keep in mind, however, that when you initialize preferences, you lose your custom set-
tings, and later you may want to reset your favorite preferences manually.
1	
Choose Logic Pro X > Preferences > Advanced Tools.
2	
Under Additional Options, select Audio, Surround, MIDI, Control Surfaces, Score, 
and Advanced Editing, and then close the preferences window.
3	
Choose Logic Pro X > Preferences > Initialize All Except Key Commands.
A confirmation message appears.
4	
Click Initialize.
Your preferences are initialized to their default states.
If you’re jumping ahead to a lesson other than Lesson 1, make sure that you select all 
additional options as detailed in step 2.
Using the U.S. Key Command Preset
This book assumes that you are using the default initialized key command preset for a U.S. 
keyboard. So, you may find that some of the key commands in your Logic installation do 
not function as they are described in this book.
If at any point, you find that the key commands don’t respond as described (for example, T 
doesn’t open the Toolbox as explained in the first exercise of Lesson 3), then you should per-
form the following steps to back up your current key command set and replace it with the 
key command preset included with the lesson files downloaded from www.peachpit.com.
1	
Choose Logic Pro X > Key Commands > Edit.
First, it is important to back up your current key commands, particularly if you’ve 
already created a set of custom key commands and want to restore it after you’ve fin-
ished working with this book.
www.ebook3000.com

Preparing Your Logic Workstation    xvii
2	
In the Key Commands window, choose Options > Export Key Commands.
A Save As dialog opens.
3	
In the Save As dialog, keep the default Key Commands location in the Save As field, 
and name your preset My shortcuts.
Your custom shortcuts can now be recalled as any other key command preset.
4	
In the Key Commands window, choose Options > Preset to open the menu.
Your new preset appears at the bottom of the Presets sub-menu.
Now let’s import the key commands that you downloaded with your lesson files. The 
next steps assume that you’ve completed the steps in the Getting Started section, 
“Downloading and Using the Logic Lesson Files,” and that the Logic Pro X folder you 
downloaded from peachpit.com is on your desktop.
5	
In the Key Commands window, choose Options > Import Key Commands.
An Open dialog appears.

xviii    Getting Started
6	
In the Open dialog, click the Desktop icon in the sidebar (or press Command-D). Open 
the Logic Pro X Files folder, and inside the Media folder, open US-Defaults.logikcs.
Logic will now respond to the key commands as described in this book.
Screen Resolution
Depending on your display resolution, some of the project files may appear different on 
your screen than they do in the book. When you open a project, if you can’t see the whole 
Arrange window, move the window until you can see the three window controls at the left 
of the title bar, and click the Zoom button (the third button from the left) to fit the window 
to the screen.
When using a low display resolution, you may also have to zoom or scroll more often than 
instructed in the book when performing some of the exercise steps. In some cases, you 
may have to temporarily resize or close an area of the Arrange window to complete an 
action in another area.

Click Save (or press Return).
The project is now saved on your desktop, and its name is displayed at the top of the 
Logic Pro X window. To avoid losing your work, save your project often. 
NOTE ▶ ​Logic Pro X automatically saves your project at regular intervals while you’re 
working on it. If the application unexpectedly quits, the next time you reopen the 
project, a dialog prompts you to reopen the most recent manually saved version or the 
most recent auto-saved version.
You’ve now set up your new project. With a blank canvas ready, you can start being creative.
Creating a new project in Logic opens the main window, which will be your main work 
area. In the next exercise, you will examine the panes of the main window.
Exploring the Interface
When working with Logic Pro X, you will spend most of your time in the main window. 
To customize the main window, you can toggle and resize its various panes to access all 
the media, tools, and features you need for your project.

Control bar
Tracks area
Inspector
In its default configuration, the main window has three areas:
▶
▶
Control bar—The control bar contains buttons to toggle areas on and off; transport 
buttons to control playback operations (such as play, stop, rewind, and forward); 
information displays to indicate the playhead position, project tempo, key, and time 
signatures; and mode buttons such as Count-in and Metronome.
▶
▶
Inspector—The inspector provides access to a contextual set of parameters. The specific 
parameters displayed depend on the selected track or region, or the area in key focus.
▶
▶
Tracks area—The Tracks area is where you build your song by arranging regions on 
tracks located below a ruler.
Customizing your main window layout to display the tools you need allows you to work 
faster and more comfortably, thereby giving you more time to focus on your music.

The Loop Browser opens to the right of the Tracks area.
NOTE ▶ ​The first time you open the Loop Browser, you have to wait for Logic to 
index the loops before you can use it.
You now have the control bar at the top, the Tracks area to the left, and the Loop 
Browser to the right, which is the perfect layout for the next exercise.
You’re already gaining familiarity with the Logic Pro X interface. By showing only those 
panes needed for the task at hand, you make your work easier and faster, allowing you to 
focus on the creative side. And talking about creative side, let’s start making some music!
Adding Apple Loops
You will now start building your project using Apple Loops, which are prerecorded music 
snippets that automatically match the tempo of your project and are designed to be 
repeated seamlessly. 
Professional producers use Apple Loops all the time for video soundtracks, to add texture 
to a beat, to create unexpected effects, and so on. At least one major hit song was produced 
entirely around a single Apple Loop. The Apple Loops included with Logic Pro X (and ear-
lier versions of Logic) are royalty free, so you can use them in professional projects without 
worrying about licensing rights.

12    Make Music with Logic Now! 
Browsing and Previewing Loops
To start building this song, you need to preview loops, and choose which ones to use. The 
Loop Browser is the perfect tool for this job. It allows you to browse loops by instrument, 
genre, mood, and other attributes.
1	
In the Loop Browser, click the All Drums, Acoustic, and Distorted keyword buttons.

NOTE ▶ ​The lessons in this book assumes you begin with a default installation of 
Logic Pro X as described in “Getting Started,” along with the additional media pro-
vided with the book—but not including the Legacy and Compatibility content. Your 
Loop Browser and Library may display additional items if you have installed the 
Legacy and Compatibility content.

Each time you click a keyword button, the results list is shortened because fewer loops 
match the narrowing keyword search.
You can preview loops by clicking them.
2	
In the results list, click the first loop, Deep End Beat (or press Control-Spacebar).
The loop is selected, its blue loop icon turns into a speaker and the loop plays. At any 
time you can click another loop to preview it, or click the currently-playing loop to 
stop playback.
Apple Loops are previewed at the project’s tempo. In the control bar, the LCD display 
shows the default project tempo of 120 bpm (beats per minute). You are currently 
previewing the loop at that default tempo.
Project tempo
In the results list, you can see that Deep End Beat was produced at a tempo of 92 bpm. 
Loops usually work best when used at or near their original tempos, so let’s change 
the project tempo.
 You can change numerical values in Logic Pro X two ways: Drag the value up or 
down to increase or decrease it, or double-click the value and enter the desired number.
3	
In the control bar’s LCD display, drag the tempo value down to 92 bpm.
As you adjust the project tempo, you can hear the loop slow down and finally settle to 
the 92 bpm project tempo. The loop does seem to groove better at the slower tempo.

14    Make Music with Logic Now! 
4	
Click the next loop, Good Life Beat, to preview it at the project tempo of 92 bpm.
This loop has a nice funky feel, and you are going to use it as the beat for your music 
project.
5	
Drag Good Life Beat from the results list to track 1 in the workspace, making sure the 
help tag reads Position: 1 1 1 1.
Workspace
The workspace is the area below the ruler and to the right of the track headers, where 
regions are arranged to build a song.
The loop is imported, and an audio region is placed on the audio track at the very 
beginning of the project. An alert asks if you would like to use the tempo information 
embedded in the loop. The Loop Browser shows that the Good Life Beat original tempo 
is 88 bpm, a little slower than your current 92 bpm tempo. You will use that new tempo.
6	
Click Import (or press Return).
In the control bar’s LCD display, the project tempo changes to 88 bpm.
7	
Choose File > Save (or press Command-S).
Your project now contains a single drum loop on a single track that plays only during bar 1. 
It’s the most basic project, just enough for you to dive into the basic tasks of positioning the

Navigating the Project    15
playhead, and starting and stopping playback. Later you will use those navigation chops to 
preview bass lines while listening to your new drum region, and add more loops.
Navigating the Project
One of the big advantages to producing music with a computer is that the whole song is 
laid out right before your eyes. This representation makes it extremely easy to jump to a 
particular part of the song, start playback, quickly return to the beginning, or continu-
ously repeat a section. 
Logic offers many ways to navigate your project. In the following two exercises, you will 
use the transport buttons and their key commands; and you will learn how to continu-
ously repeat a section of the project, which will allow you to keep playing the drum loop 
while you preview bass loops. 
Using Transport Buttons and Key Commands
When you’re producing music, time is of the essence. Because many producing tasks are 
repetitive, you may find yourself playing, stopping, and positioning the playhead every 
few seconds. Minimizing the time it takes to perform these basic operations will greatly 
improve your workflow and save valuable time.
While you may initially find it easier to click transport buttons with the mouse, moving a 
mouse with your hand while keeping your eyes on the screen is actually a time-consuming 
task. Using key commands to control playback can significantly reduce that time, increas-
ing your workflow efficiency as your fingers build up muscle memory.
To fully master key commands, you first need to understand key focus. To start this next 
exercise, you will preview an Apple Loop to make sure your Loop Browser has key focus. 
1	
In the Loop Browser results list, click any loop to preview it.
2	
Click that same loop again to stop it.
Blue frame indicates key focus

16    Make Music with Logic Now! 
Notice the blue frame around the Loop Browser. It indicates that the Loop Browser 
has key focus, and is ready to respond to all Loop Browser key commands. Only one 
area at a time can have key focus. Right now the Tracks area does not have key focus 
and may not respond to some Tracks area key commands such as the Spacebar, which 
you can press to start and stop project playback.
3	
Press the Spacebar.
Nothing happens. You first need to give key focus to the Tracks area.
4	
Click the background of the workspace (or press Tab).
The blue frame appears around the Tracks area to show that the Tracks area has key 
focus.
 When multiple panes are open in the main window, you can press Tab and 
Shift-Tab to cycle the key focus forward and backward through the panes.
5	
Press the Spacebar.
In the Tracks area, the playhead starts moving, playback begins, and you can hear the 
drum region on your track. When the playhead reaches bar 2, the drum region stops. 
Because the track contains no other regions, there’s nothing else to play.
To navigate your project, you can also click the transport buttons in the control bar.
Stop

6	
In the control bar, click the Stop button (or press the Spacebar).
Go to Beginning
The playhead stops, and the Stop button is replaced with a Go to Beginning button.

Click the Rewind button (or press , [comma]) a few times.
The playhead jumps one bar backward each time.
 To fast forward or fast rewind eight bars at a time, press Shift-. (period)  
and Shift-, (comma).
You can also position the playhead precisely where you want it by clicking in the ruler.
10	 In the lower half of the ruler, click bar 5 to move the playhead to that location.
Ruler
To start or stop playback at a specific location, you can double-click the lower half of 
the ruler. 
11	 Double-click the lower half of the ruler at bar 3.
Playback starts from bar 3. You can also position the playhead without interrupting 
playback.
12	 Without stopping playback, click the lower half of the ruler at bar 1. 
You can again hear your drum loop. 
13	 Double-click in the lower-half of the ruler.
Playback stops and the playhead moves to the location you clicked.
Continuously Repeating a Section
Sometimes when you are working on a specific section of your project, you may want to 
repeat a section multiple times without stopping playback. As you’re working, the beat 
keeps going, and you no longer have to manually relocate the playhead.
You will continue building your project by adding a bass track. To determine which bass 
loop works best with your drums, you will use Cycle mode to continuously repeat bar 1 
as you preview bass loops in the Loop Browser.

18    Make Music with Logic Now!

In the control bar, click the Cycle button.
In the ruler, the cycle area turns yellow, indicating that Cycle mode is enabled. 
Cycle area
Left locator
Right locator
The cycle area shows the section of the song that will repeat. The start and end posi-
tions of the cycle area are called left and right locators. Currently the cycle area 
extends from bar 1 to bar 5, but our drum loop is only one bar long.
You need to adjust the locators so that the cycle area spans the same length as the 
drum region. To do so, you will first select the drum region, which was deselected in 
the previous exercise when you clicked the background of the workspace.
Unselected region

 When choosing a menu command, the corresponding key command usually 
appears to the right. 
The cycle area now goes from bar 1 to bar 2 like the drum region. When you choose 
“Set Rounded Locators by Selection,” the locators are always rounded to the nearest 
bar, so repeating the cycle area keeps the groove going.
 To turn on Cycle mode and set locators by selection, you can click the Set 
Locators button in the toolbar.
4	
Press the Spacebar to start playback.
The playhead starts moving and your drums play. When the playhead reaches bar 2, it 
immediately jumps back to the beginning of bar 1 and continues playback. 
While your drums continue playing, you can preview some bass loops.
5	
In the Loop Browser, click the Reset button.
All keyword buttons are disabled.
For the bass loops, let’s limit the search to a specific musical genre.

20    Make Music with Logic Now! 
6	
At the top of the Loop Browser, from the Loops pop-up menu, choose Hip Hop.
Only loops from the Hip Hop collection are displayed in the results list.
7	
Below the All Drums keyword button, click the Bass button.
Since we know loops typically work better when played close to their original tempos, 
let’s sort the results list by tempo and look for loops that were produced at or around 
88 bpm.
8	
At the top of the results list, click the Tempo column name.
The loops in the results list are sorted by increasing tempo.

Scroll down to see loops with a tempo of 88 bpm.
10	 Click the first loop.
After a moment, Logic syncs the loop with the project and you can hear it playing, 
grooving along with the drums in your project. 
11	 Continue clicking the following loops to preview them one by one.
Most of them are too synthetic for this project, but Skyline Bass seems to have the 
right sound and it works with your drums. With an original tempo of 90 bpm, it’s still 
very close to your project tempo, which means it should work great. 
Skyline Bass is listed in the results list as a 16 beats loop, but right now your cycle area is 
playing only one bar (at the current 4/4 time signature, 1 bar = 4 beats), so you’re hear-
ing only a portion of the bass loop. Let’s add it to the project to audition the entire loop.
12	 In the Control bar, click the Stop button (or give key focus to the Tracks area and 
press the Spacebar) to stop playback.

13	 Drag Skyline Bass to the workspace below the drum loop, making sure the help tag 
reads 1 1 1 1.
A new track is automatically created for the new Skyline Bass region.
14	 In the ruler, click the yellow cycle area (or press C) to turn off Cycle mode.
15	 In the control bar, click the Go to Beginning button (or press Return).
16	 Press the Spacebar to start playback.
In the first bar, you can hear both the drum loop and the bass loop, then the drums 
drop off while the bass continues playing for three more bars. You can now hear 
the entire bass line, which is even more melodic than the limited preview you heard 
previously. 
17	 Press the Spacebar again to stop playback. 
18	 Choose File > Save (or press Command-S).
As you work in Logic, keep saving your project at regular intervals to avoid losing any 
of your work. 
Setting locators to adjust the cycle area is a technique you’ll use often throughout your 
production to focus on part of a project. And if you work with other musicians in your 
studio, they will love you for not interrupting the playback (and ruining their creative 
flow) every few bars!

Building Up the Rhythm Section
All the material you use for a project is contained in regions that are on tracks in the 
workspace. Creating an arrangement is a little like playing with building blocks—moving, 
copying, or repeating regions as needed to determine at which points specific instruments 
start and stop playing. 
In this exercise, you will start building an arrangement with the drum and bass loops, and 
later add more loops to complete your project. First, you will loop both regions so they 
play continuously. 
1	
In the control bar, click the Inspector button (or press I). 
The Inspector appears. Region parameters for the selected region(s) are displayed in 
the Region inspector near the top.
2	
In the workspace, click the Good Life Beat region in track 1 to select it. 
The Region inspector shows the parameters of the Good Life Beat region.
3	
In the Region inspector, select the Loop checkbox (or press L). 
In the workspace, Good Life Beat is now looping until the end of the project.
4	
In the workspace, click the bass region in track 2 to select it.

Listen to a few bars of the project. 
The drums and bass are grooving together perfectly. You’re going to layer the drums 
with an urban percussion loop that will also help create a nice little intro.
 To work more efficiently, remember to hide those areas you don’t need to see. 
For the next few exercises, in the control bar, click the Inspector button (or press I) and 
click the Apple Loops button (or press O) to turn those two areas on and off as needed.

From the results list, drag Fine Line Beat to bar 1 below the two tracks in the 
workspace.
A new track is created for the Fine Line Beat region. Since Fine Line Beat is still 
selected, you can access its region parameters at the top of the inspector. 

24    Make Music with Logic Now! 
10	 In the Fine Line Beat region parameters, select the Loop checkbox (or press L).
The Fine Line Beat region is now looping in the workspace. Since Fine Line Beat will 
be used for the intro, you can move it to the top of the workspace.
11	 In the Fine Line Beat track header, click-hold the track icon and drag up until the two 
other tracks move down.
The tracks are reordered with the new Fine Line Beat track at the top.
To create an intro in which only Fine Line Beat is playing, you’ll move the two other 
regions further to the right. To select multiple regions at once, you can click in the 
workspace background and drag the pointer over the regions. 
12	 In the workspace, click the background, and drag up to select both the Good Life Beat 
and the Skyline Bass regions.

Navigating the Project    25
Both regions are highlighted to indicate that they’re selected. You can now move them 
both at the same time. 
13	 Make sure you click one of the selected regions (don’t click one of the loops to their 
right), and drag to bar 5. 
If you clicked Good Life Beat, the help tag shows:
▶
▶Position: 5 1 1 1—Where the regions are moved
▶
▶+4 0 0 0—The regions are moved exactly 4 bars later.
▶
▶Length: 1 0 0 0—Length of the clicked region
▶
▶2—Track number of the clicked region
If you clicked Skyline Bass, the second line in the help tag shows:
▶
▶Length: 4 0 0 0
▶
▶3
The help tag displays positions and lengths in bars, beats, divisions, and ticks. You will 
often refer to a position or a length with those four numbers. 
▶
▶The bar consists of several beats (four beats in the 4/4 time signature here). 
▶
▶The beat is the denominator in the time signature (quarter note here).
▶
▶The division determines how the grid is subdivided in the ruler when zoomed in 
horizontally (sixteenth note here).
▶
▶A clock tick is 1/960 of a quarter note. A sixteenth note contains 240 ticks.
Note that in the control bar, the LCD displays the position of the playhead using the 
same four units.

26    Make Music with Logic Now! 
14	 Listen to your project from the beginning. 
It’s time to practice your navigation chops! You can click the Play and Stop/Go to 
Beginning buttons in the control bar, click and double-click the lower half of the ruler, 
or use the key commands:
▶
▶Spacebar = Play/Stop
▶
▶Return = Go to Beginning
▶
▶. (period) = Forward
▶
▶, (comma) = Rewind
The intro sounds good, and the layered drum loops work great together. However, 
Good Life Beat is too loud.
15	 In the Good Life Beat track header (track 2), drag the Volume slider to the left to turn 
down the volume to about –8.0 dB.
Now the two drum loops blend together.
Near the end of this lesson, you will spend more time mixing the song; but for now let’s 
continue editing regions and adding more loops to continue the arrangement. 
Zooming In to Edit the Intro
Your project starts with a 4-bar intro in which only the Fine Line Beat region on track 1 
plays the beat. It feels sparse, but the beat is original enough to capture attention, which 
www.ebook3000.com

Navigating the Project    27
is the role of an intro. Then at bar 5 both the Good Life Beat and Skyline Bass regions on 
tracks 2 and 3 come in, making the beat sound complete and introducing the melody. 
To accentuate the starting impact of the two new regions, you will create a couple of unex-
pected edits at the end of the intro that are bound to make the listener’s head turn. To be 
able to edit the Fine Line Beat region in the intro without affecting its loops to the right, 
you first have to copy the region to bar 5. 
1	
Option-drag the Fine Line Beat region to bar 5.
When Option-dragging to copy regions, always make sure you release the mouse but-
ton first and the Option key last. If you try to release both at the same time, you may 
sometimes release the Option key slightly before the mouse button without noticing, 
and then the region is moved instead of copied. 
If you copied the Fine Line Beat region successfully, your workspace will look like this:
If you don’t see a Fine Line Beat region between bars 1 and 5, you’ve moved the 
region rather than copying it. To reverse your last action, choose Edit > Undo Drag, 
and then try again.
The new Fine Line Beat.1 region at bar 5 currently stops the original Fine Line Beat 
region at bar 1 from looping. However the region’s Loop parameter is still on, so its 
loops reappear if there’s room for them on the track. To create a break, you need to 
stop the region from looping.

28    Make Music with Logic Now! 
2	
Click the Fine Line Beat region at bar 1 to select it.
3	
In the inspector, deselect the Loop checkbox (or press L).
To create a break in the beat at the end of the intro, you will shorten the Fine Line 
Beat region so that it doesn’t play the last two notes of the region. To resize the region 
comfortably, you need to zoom in until you can clearly see the individual drum hits 
on the waveform. 
To turn the mouse pointer into a Zoom tool, you hold down Control and Option, and 
then drag the area you want to magnify. The size of the area you drag determines how 
far you will zoom in: the smaller the area that you drag, the closer you’ll zoom in.
4	
Control-Option-drag a small blue highlight rectangle about one bar wide, but strad-
dling the junction of the two regions on track 1 at bar 5.
The area you highlighted expands to fill the workspace, and you can clearly see indi-
vidual drum hits on the waveform.
Individual drum hits

Zooming in and out efficiently to see exactly what you need takes practice. If you’re 
not happy with what you’re seeing in your workspace, Control-Option-click the work-
space to zoom back out, and try again.
 If you’re happy with your workspace view but feel that you should zoom in 
even closer, zoom in again. You can Control-Option-drag to zoom in multiple times 
and Control-Option-click the workspace multiple times to zoom back out through 
the same zoom levels.
To create the break at the end of the Fine Line Beat region, you will drag its lower-
right corner to the left until the final two drum hits are hidden.
5	
Move the mouse pointer over the lower-right corner of the Fine Line Beat region (the 
mouse pointer should be located just before bar 5).
Resize pointer
The mouse pointer turns into a Resize pointer you can drag to determine where the 
region stops playing. 
6	
Drag the Resize pointer to the left to hide the final two drum hits.

30    Make Music with Logic Now! 
7	
Control-Option-click the workspace to zoom out.
8	
Listen to the song from the beginning.
The drum break creates a sudden void at the end of the intro, which reinforces the 
impact of the drums and bass. But a void calls to be filled! That break in the drum 
loop is the perfect time to capture the attention of the listener by introducing the bass 
a few notes earlier. 
This time you will copy the bass region from bar 5 to bar 1, and resize the bass region 
in the intro from the left so it plays only the final few notes.
9	
On track 3, Option-drag the Skyline Bass region to bar 1.
10	 In the new Skyline Bass.1 Region inspector, deselect the Loop checkbox (or press L).
This time you will use the Z key to zoom in and out of the selection.
11	 Press Z.
The Skyline Bass expands to fill the workspace.
12	 Move the mouse pointer over the lower-left corner of the region, and drag the Resize 
pointer to the right, leaving only the last group of five notes.

13	 Click the background of the workspace to deselect all regions.
When there’s no selection, pressing the Z key shows you all the regions in your 
workspace. 
14	 Press Z. 
The workspace zooms out to display all the regions. It doesn’t allow for the region’s 
loops. You can use zoom sliders or key commands to fine-tune the zoom level.
15	 At the top of the workspace, drag the horizontal zoom slider to the left (or press 
Command-Left Arrow a few times).

32    Make Music with Logic Now! 
Vertical zoom slider
Horizontal zoom slider
The workspace zooms out horizontally, and you can see a few more bars in your ruler.
NOTE ▶ ​When zooming horizontally using the zoom sliders or Command-Arrow key 
combinations, the playhead stays at the same position on your screen, unless a region 
is selected and the playhead is not within that region’s borders. In that case the left 
edge of the region stays at the same position on your screen.
When zooming vertically with the zoom sliders or Command-Arrow keys, the 
selected track stays at the same position on your screen.
16	 Play your new intro.
It works! You start with an original but commanding beat with kicks and hand claps, then 
all of a sudden, the bass announces the melody with a few pickup notes while the beat 
stops. On the first beat of the next bar, all three tracks play the entire groove together. 
That little break at the end of the intro really helps call attention to the layered drum and 
bass groove that starts after the intro.
Remember your newly acquired navigation and zooming skills. You will continue using 
them to finish this arrangement, and throughout the rest of this book (and long after).

Build Up the Arrangement    33
Build Up the Arrangement
Now that you have the rhythmic foundation of your project (the drums and bass), you can 
continue building up the arrangement and avoid monotony by adding melodic elements.
Adding Lead Synths
In the next exercise, you will add a couple of synth arpeggio loops. And rather than let 
them loop throughout the song, you will keep things moving by alternating between the 
two synth melodies.
1	
In the Loop Browser, click the X symbol in the search field to clear the previous 
search. 
You already have a solid rhythmic section with bass and low kick drums, so now you 
are looking for rather clean and high-pitched sounds.
2	
Click the Synths and Clean keyword buttons.
3	
In the search field, type Arpeggio.
4	
In the results list, click the Name column title to reorder the results by loop name.

34    Make Music with Logic Now! 
5	
In the results list, click the first six or seven loops to preview them.
Two loops fit the bill perfectly: Barricade Arpeggio and Deal Breaker Arpeggio. If 
necessary, adjust the zoom level in the workspace so you can comfortably drag both 
loops to two new tracks.
6	
Drag the Barricade Arpeggio loop to the bottom of the workspace at bar 9.
7	
Drag the Deal Breaker Arpeggio loop to the bottom of the workspace at bar 10.
You will resize the Deal Breaker Arpeggio region to make it one bar long, the same 
length as the Barricade Arpeggio region. 
8	
Drag the lower-right corner of the Deal Breaker Arpeggio region to make it one bar long.
www.ebook3000.com

Build Up the Arrangement    35
You will now copy both regions so they play alternately. 
9	
Click the background, and drag a rectangle around both regions to select them. 
10	 Option-drag the selected regions so that the copy of the Barricade Arpeggio region 
starts where the Deal Breaker Arpeggio region ends.
11	 Play the new synth section.
The two synths bring much-needed melody and movement to the song, and they 
work well in answering each other, each one successively playing its melody. 
Currently, both synths sound as if they are coming from the center of the stereo field. 
To give them a little space, you can spread them apart acoustically by positioning 
them to either side of the stereo field.
12	 On the Barricade Arpeggio track header, click the Balance knob and drag down to 
turn the knob to the left.
NOTE ▶ ​When working with stereo audio content, the rotary knob in the track 
header (and the rotary knob to the top of the Volume fader on the channel strip) is a 
Balance knob. When working with mono audio content, that knob is a Pan knob.

36    Make Music with Logic Now! 
13	 On the Deal Breaker Arpeggio track, click the Balance knob and drag up to turn it to 
the right.
14	 Play the synth section again.
You can now hear the two synths playing from opposite sides of the stereo field, 
which adds dimension to the music and helps to separate the two instruments.
Creating a Break
Until now, you have kept your project interesting by introducing new elements on a regu-
lar basis: the bass at the end of the intro, the drums at bar 5, a synth at bar 9, and another 
synth at bar 10. But if you keep building your song by adding more elements, at some 
point those additions may backfire. The song can become bloated with the arrangement 
losing focus, the mix becoming muddy, and the listeners tuning out. Who wants that?
So if you can’t add any more to your song, subtract! By the end of the new synth section, 
the listeners are so used to hearing the drums and the bass that they may no longer pay 
attention to them. If you remove them, you can create a big impact. So let’s add a piano 
loop after the synth section, and then delete the drums and bass while the piano plays.
At the top of the Tracks area, look at the tool menus:
Left-click tool
Command-click tool
The menu to the left corresponds to the tool assigned to the mouse pointer.
The menu to the right corresponds to the tool assigned to the mouse pointer when hold-
ing down Command. 
Currently the Left-click tool is assigned to the Pointer tool (arrow icon) and the Command-
click tool is assigned to the Marquee tool (crosshair icon). You don’t need to change those 
assignments, but if you’re curious, feel free to click one of the tool menus to open it and see 
what’s available. Click it again to close it.
The Loop Browser sometimes shows multiple loops with similar names, and that usually 
means that the loops all follow the same groove, the same chord progression, or are other-
wise meant to work together. Let’s see if we have any other Skyline Apple Loops meant to 
work with our Skyline Bass loop.

Preview the four loops.
The loops sound like they would all work great together because they all follow the 
same harmony and rhythm. 
4	
Drag the Skyline Piano loop to the bottom of the workspace at bar 13.
You will now create the break by deleting the drums in track 2 and the bass in track 3 
for the entire time the piano is playing.
5	
Hold down the Command key to turn the mouse pointer into a Marquee tool.

The Fine Line Beat.1 region stops looping at bar 21. 
10	 Repeat the same process to stop the drums on track 2 and the bass on track 3 at bar 21. 
11	 Move the playhead to bar 11 and press Spacebar to play through the break and ending.
The break brings much needed space and silences, interrupts the flow of the rhythmic 
section, and automatically shines a light on the two remaining elements: the drum 
loop and the piano. After the break, the rhythmic section resumes, but the ending at 
bar 21 is too abrupt. Let’s bring back the piano by itself to create a quick outro.
12	 On track 6, Option-drag the Skyline Piano region to bar 21.
You will finally shorten the new copy of the piano region so it ends with a sustaining 
note, which will work better for an ending.

40    Make Music with Logic Now! 
13	 Control-Option-drag around the Skyline Piano.1 region to zoom in on it.
14	 Drag the lower-right corner of the Skyline Piano.1 region to the left so that it ends 
with the long sustaining note in bar 23.
15	 Control-Option-click the workspace to zoom out.
16	 Play the entire project.
You have arranged your first song. Using only six Apple Loops, you’ve built a simple one-
minute song that evolves from an original intro into a solid bass and drums groove. Then 
two synths share the lead melody for a few bars before the bass and drums abruptly stop 
to leave room for a piano break. Finally, the bass and drums groove returns, and the song 
finishes with a few sustained piano notes. Really nice! You will now quickly mix the song 
and later export it to share it.
Mixing the Song
Now that you have arranged your regions in the workspace, you can focus on the sound 
of each instrument, and how they sound as an ensemble. You can adjust each instrument’s 
loudness and its position in the stereo field, and even modify its timbre so all the instru-
ments blend harmoniously. 
You will open the Mixer, and name your channel strips so you can easily determine which 
instrument they control. You will then adjust the Volume faders and Balance knobs to 
change levels and stereo positions, and apply patches and plug-ins to process some of the 
instruments.

Choosing Names and Icons for Tracks and Channel Strips
1	
In the control bar, click the Mixer button (or press X).
At the bottom of the main window, the Mixer opens.
The channel strips are named after the Apple Loops you previously dragged to the 
workplace. To more quickly locate instruments, you can assign the channel strips 
more descriptive names. 
To edit the name on a track header and on its corresponding channel strip, you can 
double-click either, and type the new name.
2	
At the bottom of the first channel strip, double-click the Fine Line Beat name.
A text entry box appears, and the previous name—Fine Line Beat—is selected. 

42    Make Music with Logic Now! 
3	
Type Beat Loop, and press Return.
Both the first channel strip in the Mixer and track 1 in the Tracks area are renamed 
Beat Loop. Renaming tracks in the track header is often easier because you can 
quickly identify instruments by looking at the regions you’ve been arranging.
4	
In the control bar, click the Mixer button again (or press X) to close the Mixer.
5	
In track 2’s track header, double-click the Good Life Beat name.
A text entry box pops up. This time you will enter a name and pop up the text entry 
box of the next track with a single key command.
6	
Type Drums, and press Tab.
Track 2 is renamed Drums. A text entry box appears on track 3’s name, ready to be 
edited. 
7	
Type Bass, and press Tab.
Track 3 is renamed Bass, and track 4 is ready to be renamed. Continue this process to 
change the name of the three remaining tracks as follows:
▶
▶Track 4 to Synth 1
▶
▶Track 5 to Synth 2
▶
▶Track 6 to Piano
 In the Mixer, you can also press Tab to enter a name and open the text entry 
box of the next channel strip. Should you enter a name incorrectly, press Shift-Tab to 
open the text entry box of the previous track or channel strip. 
Notice that track 2 has only a generic audio waveform icon. That’s because the track 
was created before you dragged the Good Life Beat loop to it at the very beginning of 
this lesson.

In the Tracks area, Control-click the icon in track 2’s track header.
A shortcut menu displays icons organized in categories. 
9	
In the shortcut menu, click the Drums category.
A collection of various drum icons appears.
10	 Click an icon representing a drum kit.
The icon is now visible in the track header. The same icon is also assigned to the cor-
responding channel strip in the Mixer, as you will see in a moment.
When your creative juices are flowing, and you just want to make a quick adjustment to 
the sound of an instrument, wasting time looking for the correct track or channel strip 
can be frustrating. Or worse, you could become a victim of the classic mistake: turning 
knobs and faders but not hearing the sound reacting to your adjustments, until you realize 
you were adjusting the wrong instrument!
Taking a minute to assign your tracks and channel strips descriptive names and appropriate 
icons can accelerate your workflow and avoid potentially costly mistakes.

The Mixer is now taller, and you can see more options above the channel strips. 
There are a lot of options, but don’t worry. Just because you have many tools available 
doesn’t mean you have to use them all. You will learn about those options as needed.
NOTE ▶ ​Depending on the size of your display, you may not be able to open up the 
Mixer all the way. In that case, you can drag the vertical scrollbar to the right of the 
Mixer to scroll up and see all the options.
4	
Play your song.
With the Mixer open and occupying most of the main window, the workspace is 
much smaller. Depending on your display resolution, navigating your song efficiently 
may prove challenging (or nearly impossible). To remedy that, you will now adjust the 
locators in the Tracks area ruler, and use Cycle mode to continuously repeat a part of 
the song that contains all the instruments.
5	
Click the Mixer button (or press X) to close the Mixer.
If necessary, scroll or zoom out in the workspace so you can see your entire arrange-
ment. Remember: To see all your regions, click the background of the workspace, and 
press Z.
6	
Drag the upper half of the ruler from bar 9 to bar 13.

46    Make Music with Logic Now! 
Cycle mode is turned on, and a cycle area appears where you dragged. The cycle area 
spans the part of the song in which the two synths, the drums, and the bass play, so 
you can focus on adjusting the sounds of those instruments. Later, when you’re ready 
to work with the piano, you will just drag the cycle area to the following four bars 
where the piano plays.
7	
Press the Spacebar.
Playback starts at the beginning of the cycle area, and the playhead keeps repeating 
bars 9 through 13, where the two synths are playing.
8	
Click the Mixer button (or press X) to open the Mixer.
Synth 2 is significantly louder than Synth 1. Let’s bring its level down so that both 
synths are equally loud.
9	
Click the background of the Mixer to deselect the channel strips, and on the Synth 2 
channel strip, drag down the Volume fader.
Pan/Balance knob
Gain
Volume fader
Continue adjusting the Volume fader until the Gain display reads –10. The Volume 
fader affects how much gain is applied to the audio signal at the output of the channel 
strip, and therefore, controls how loudly that instrument plays. Synth 2 is now quieter 
and closer to the level of Synth 1. 
You will now adjust the Balance knobs on the two synth tracks to spread them a little 
farther apart in the stereo image.
10	 On the Synth 1 channel strip, drag the Balance knob all the way down to –64.
www.ebook3000.com

Mixing the Song    47
11	 On the Synth 2 channel strip, drag the Balance knob all the way up to +63.
The synths sound too far apart now and seem disconnected from the rhythm section. 
The effect is even more pronounced if you listen to the song through headphones. 
Let’s bring the two synths back toward the center of the mix.
12	 Adjust the Synth 1 and Synth 2 pan knobs to values of about –35 and +35, 
respectively. 
The two synths come back closer to the center of the stereo field. Now they sound like 
they belong in the mix.
13	 Press the spacebar to stop playback.
Processing Instruments with Plug-Ins
There’s more to mixing than adjusting each instrument’s volume and stereo position. Now 
you will apply effect plug-ins to process the audio signal flowing through the channel 
strip, thereby changing the tone of your instruments. 
In this exercise you will use a bass amp plug-in to add an edgier character to the bass, and 
a reverberation plug-in to bring warmth and dimension to the piano.

Mixing the Song    49
The Bass Amp Designer plug-in is inserted in the Audio FX slot on the channel strip, 
and its interface opens. Let’s compare the sound of the bass with and without the 
plug-in applied.
3	
Click the Power button.
The Power button dims to indicate that the plug-in is off. You can hear what the bass 
sounds like without the plug-in. It sounds a bit muffled and vaguely distant.
4	
Click the Power button again.
The attacks of the bass notes sound brighter, and have a little grit to them, giving the 
bass character. You could experiment with different amp models, but right now the 
Factory Default setting works great, so let’s move on. 
The bass amp also made the bass a bit louder. In fact, it is a little too loud now.

Mixing Down to a Stereo File    51
The piano immediately occupies more space and has more body. And in your 
arrangement, whenever the piano plays, not many other instruments are playing, so 
this setting works great. 
12	 Click the close button to close the Space Designer plug-in window.
13	 Click the Mixer button (or press X) to close it.
14	 In the ruler, click the cycle area (or press C) to turn off Cycle mode.
15	 Play the entire song.
Peak level display
In the Inspector, look at the peak level display on the Output channel strip. When a 
part of the song is too loud, the Output channel strip peak level display shows a posi-
tive value and turns red, indicating that the audio signal is distorted. In this project, 
the highest peak in the song is under 0 dB FS, and no distortion is created.
In a relatively short time, you have produced a one-minute instrumental song with six 
tracks, edited the regions in the workspace to build an arrangement, mixed the instru-
ments in the Mixer, and added plug-ins to process their sounds. You now have a piece of 
music that would work fine, for example, during the credits of a radio or TV show, or as a 
music bed for a TV ad.
Mixing Down to a Stereo File
The last step is to mix down the music to a single stereo audio file so that anyone can play 
it on consumer-level audio software or hardware. In this exercise, you will bounce the 
project to a stereo audio file. By first selecting all your regions, you can avoid the need to 
manually adjust the bounce start and end positions.

To build a song, you need to come up with the raw material you will later 
arrange and mix. You might start with an idea you have in your head, a 
part you rehearsed on an instrument, or a prerecorded sample or loop, or 
you may just start experimenting until inspiration strikes. To sustain and 
develop that initial inspiration, you need to master the techniques that 
Logic offers to record, create, and edit the audio and MIDI regions that 
constitute the building blocks of your project.
In this lesson, you will configure Logic for audio recording and study 
activities you will typically perform when working with live musicians: 
recording a single instrument, recording additional takes of the same 
instrument, cycle recording, multitrack recording, punching on the fly, 
and automatic punching.
Setting Up Digital Audio Recording 
Before you record audio in Logic, you have to connect a sound source (such 
as a microphone, an electric guitar, or a synthesizer) to your Mac. You then 
choose the desired recording settings, and adjust the recording level of your 
sound source to avoid distortion. 
In the following exercises, you will set up Logic to prepare for a music recording.
Recording Audio
Lesson 2

60    Recording Audio
▶	Digital Recording, Sample Rate, and Bit Depth
When audio is recorded in Logic Pro, sound pressure waves are turned into a digital 
audio file, as follows:
1.	
The microphone transforms sound pressure waves into an analog electrical signal.
2.	 The microphone preamp amplifies the analog electrical signal. A gain knob lets 
you set a proper recording level and avoid distortion.
3.	 The analog-to-digital (A/D) converter transforms the analog electrical signal 
into a digital data stream.
4.	 The audio interface sends the digital data stream from the converter to the 
computer.
5.	 Logic Pro saves the incoming data as an audio file displayed on the screen by a 
waveform representing the sound pressure waves.
To convert the analog signal into a digital data stream, the digital converters sample 
the analog signal at a very fast time interval, or sample rate. The sample rate identi-
fies how many times per second the audio is digitally sampled. The bit depth identi-
fies the number of data bits used to encode the value of each sample. The sample 
rate and bit depth settings determine the quality of a digital audio recording.
During recording, the only role for Logic is to save the digital data generated by the 
A/D converter to an audio file. Assuming that you have the correct sample rate and bit 
depth settings, Logic does not exert any influence over the quality of your recordings.
NOTE ▶ ​Most audio interfaces include analog-to-digital converters, and many include 
microphone preamps. Also, most modern Mac computers include a built-in audio 
interface. Many Mac notebook computers and iMac computers even have internal 
microphones. Although those microphones are generally not intended to produce 
professional-quality recording, you can use the internal microphones to perform the 
exercises in this lesson in the absence of an external microphone.
Setting the Sample Rate
By setting your project’s sample rate before starting your first recording, you help to insure 
that all the audio files used in that project will be recorded and played at the same sample 
www.ebook3000.com

Setting Up Digital Audio Recording     61
rate. Playing an audio file at the wrong sample rate will result in the wrong pitch and 
tempo, much like playing an audiotape or vinyl record at the wrong transport speed.
NOTE ▶ ​Be sure to read “Installing the Logic Lesson Files” in “Getting Started” before 
you continue.
1	
Open Logic Pro X Files > Lessons > 02 Get Dancing.
2	
Choose File > Project Settings > Audio.
The Project Settings window opens and you can see your Audio settings.
By default, the sample rate is set to 44.1 kHz.
To determine which sample rate to choose, consider the sample rate of any prere-
corded material you will use (such as samples), and the sample rate of the target deliv-
ery medium. Some producers who make intensive use of 44.1 kHz samples choose 
to work at that sample rate. Traditionally, music is recorded at 44.1 kHz (which is the 
sample rate of compact discs), whereas audio for video is recorded at 48 kHz (which 
is the sample rate used on DVDs).
Note that Apple Loops (such as the ones used on the six existing tracks in this proj-
ect) always play at the pitch and tempo determined by the project’s key and tempo 
settings, independent of the project sample rate.
NOTE ▶ ​The Audio Engineering Society recommends a 48 kHz sample rate for 
most applications, but recognizes the use of 44.1 kHz for compact disc and other 
consumer uses.
Let’s keep the default 44.1 kHz sample rate.
3	
Press Command-W to close the Project Settings window.

62    Recording Audio
NOTE ▶ ​In Logic, settings fall into two categories: Project settings, such as the sample 
rate, can be set individually for each project, so that each project can have unique 
project settings; Logic preferences, such as the bit depth, are the same in all projects.
Choosing the Bit Depth
The more bits you use to encode a sample, the more accurate the encoding, and the lower 
the level of noise in the digital audio file. Logic handles audio files of various bit depths in 
the same project without causing problems during playback, so you can choose a new bit 
depth when recording new content even if your project is already using files recorded with 
other bit depths.
Let’s choose an audio interface and set the bit depth.
1	
Choose Logic Pro X > Preferences > Audio.
The Audio preferences appear.
www.ebook3000.com

Recording a Single Track    63
2	
From the Output Device and Input Device menus, choose the desired audio interfaces. 
▶
▶The Output Device is the device connected to your monitors or headphones. 
▶
▶The Input Device is the device into which you plug your microphones or 
instruments. 
NOTE ▶ ​Using the same audio interface for both audio output and input is very common.
If you do not have an audio interface connected to your Mac, choose from the built-in 
output and input devices.
When the 24-Bit Recording option is not selected, Logic records at 16-bit resolution. 
A 24-bit recording has a significantly greater dynamic range than a 16-bit recording. 
The extended dynamic range lets you record at lower levels without having to worry 
about digital noise, thereby decreasing the chances of clipping your recording.
3	
Make sure the 24-Bit Recording option is selected.
4	
Press Command-W to close the Preferences window.
If you choose a new output or input device, Logic automatically reinitializes the Core 
Audio engine when you close the window.
MORE ​INFO ▶  ​Some options seldom need to be changed from the default settings. 
For more information on these, see “Changing Recording Settings” later in this lesson.
Recording a Single Track
In this example, you will record a single instrument. The exercise describes recording an 
electric guitar plugged directly into an instrument input on your audio interface, but feel 
free to record your voice or any instrument you have.
Preparing a Track for Recording
To record audio, you first have to create a new audio track, select the correct input (the 
input number on your audio interface where the guitar is plugged in), and enable that new 
track for recording.
When adding tracks, the new tracks are inserted below the selected track. To create a new 
track at the bottom of the Tracks area, you first need to select the bottom track.
1	
At the bottom of the track headers, click the Piano track header (track 6) to select it.

64    Recording Audio
2	
Above the track headers, click the Add Tracks button (+) (or press 
Command-Option-N).
The New Tracks dialog appears.
3	
Make sure the Audio track type is selected.
4	
From the Input menu, choose the audio interface input number to which you’ve con-
nected your instrument or microphone. If you are using your Mac computer’s built-in 
audio interface or your notebook’s microphone, leave the option set to Input 1.
NOTE ▶ ​Below the Input and Output menus, the input and output devices selected 
earlier in your Audio preferences are displayed. Should you need to change the input 
and/or output device, click one of the arrow buttons to the right of the device names 
to open the Audio preferences.
www.ebook3000.com

Recording a Single Track    65
You can record-enable the track by selecting the Record Enable option below the Out-
put menu; however, in some situations creating a record-enabled track may produce 
feedback. You will later take precautions to avoid feedback and then record-enable the 
track from the track header.
5	
Ensure that “Number of tracks” is set to 1.
6	
Click Create (or press Return).
A new audio track set to Input 1 is created. Logic automatically assigns the new track 
to the next available channel. Since six audio tracks were created when you dragged 
Apple Loops in Lesson 1, the new track is assigned to the Audio 7 channel and is 
automatically named Audio 7. For clarity, let’s rename it.
 Logic automatically assigns the name of a track to the audio files recorded 
on that track, so naming a track before recording on it is always a good idea. If you 
don’t name the track, Logic assigns the name of the project to the audio files. More-
descriptive names will help you identify files in the future.
7	
In the Audio 7 track header, double-click the name, and type Guitar.
The new track has a generic audio waveform icon. You will now choose a more 
appropriate icon.
8	
In the Guitar track header, Control-click the icon, and from the shortcut menu, 
choose the desired icon.

66    Recording Audio
NOTE ▶ ​To avoid feedback when recording with a microphone, monitor your record-
ing using headphones, and make sure your speakers are off.
9	
In the Guitar track header, click the R (Record Enable) button.
You can now hear your guitar and see its input level on the Guitar channel strip meter 
in the Inspector.
NOTE ▶ ​If you cannot hear your guitar, choose Logic Pro X > Preferences > Audio 
and make sure Input monitoring only for focused track, and record-enabled tracks 
is deselected.
NOTE ▶ ​You may hear a small delay between the time you play a note and when you 
hear it. This delay is called latency. You will learn how to reduce latency at the end of 
this lesson, in the section “Choosing the I/O Buffer Size.”
Because your new audio track is record-enabled (the R button on the track header is red 
and blinking), the next recording will create an audio region on that track. You can moni-
tor the audio routed to record-enabled tracks while Logic is stopped, playing, or recording.
NOTE ▶ ​If you are already using a hardware mixer or your audio interface’s software to 
monitor the audio signal routed to record-enabled tracks, turn off Software Monitoring 
in the Logic Audio preferences. Otherwise, you will be monitoring the signal twice, 
resulting in a flangy or robotic sound. 
www.ebook3000.com

Recording a Single Track    67
Monitoring Effects During Recording 
When a guitar or bass is plugged directly into an audio interface’s instrument preamp, the 
sound is clean and raw. To emulate the character a guitar amp can give to a guitar sound, 
you can use Amp Designer, a guitar amplifier modeling plug-in.
Note that you are still recording a dry guitar sound. The effect plug-in processes the dry 
audio signal in real-time during the recording and playback. Recording a dry signal means 
that you can continue fine-tuning the effect plug-ins (or exchange them for other plug-ins) 
after the recording is completed. 
1	
In the Inspector, click the Audio FX insert, and choose Amps and Pedals > Amp 
Designer.
Amp Designer opens. Here, you can dial in a sound, or choose a preset.
2	
In the Amp Designer window, click the settings menu and choose a setting that 
inspires you.

68    Recording Audio
You can now hear your guitar processed through Amp Designer. It sounds like a 
guitar plugged into a guitar amp, and recorded by a microphone in front of the amp’s 
speaker cabinet. Feel free to spend a few minutes exploring various settings and 
tweaking the amp’s knobs until you’re happy with your sound.
3	
Press Command-W to close the Amp Designer window.
Adjusting the Recording Level
Before recording, make sure you can monitor the sound through Logic, and then adjust 
the source audio level to avoid overloading the converters. On the channel strip, look at 
the peak level meter, and make sure it always stays below 0 dBFS (decibels full scale, the 
unit used to measure levels in digital audio), which would indicate that you are clipping 
the input of your converter. Keep in mind that you need to adjust the audio level before 
the converter input by using your microphone preamp gain knob. Allow some headroom, 
especially if you know that the artist might play or sing louder during the actual record-
ing. Working with a low-level recording is better than clipping the input.
NOTE ▶ ​If you are using the built-in Mac line input or microphone, you can adjust 
the input level in the Sound pane’s Input tab in System Preferences.
Let’s adjust the recording and monitoring levels, tune the guitar, and find a cool acoustic 
guitar sound.
1	
Play the loudest part of the performance you are about to record, and as you watch 
the peak level meter on the channel strip adjust the level on the instrument preamp.
2	
If the peak level meter turns yellow, lower the gain on the preamp, and click the peak 
level meter to reset it.
Make sure the peak sits comfortably below 0 dBFS: The wider the dynamic range of 
the source, the more headroom it needs to avoid clipping.
www.ebook3000.com

Recording a Single Track    69
Peak level meter
Peak level meter
Audio not clipping
Audio clipping
When your signal peaks below –2.0 dBFS, the peak level meter value is green. When 
it peaks between –2.0 and 0 dBFS, the peak level meter value is yellow to indicate that 
you are within 2 dB of clipping. (That is, you have less than 2 dB of headroom.)
Tuning the Instrument
Making sure an instrument is in tune before recording is always a good idea. The control 
bar’s Tuner button gives you quick access to Logic’s Tuner plug-in.
1	
In the control bar, click the Tuner button.
The Tuner opens.
NOTE ▶ ​The Tuner is only available in the control bar when an audio track is selected 
and an input is selected in the input slot of the corresponding channel strip. You can 
also insert the Tuner as a plug-in on a channel strip: Click an Audio FX slot, and 
choose Metering > Tuner.

70    Recording Audio
2	
One by one, tune the guitar strings, trying to get each string as close as possible to a 
0 cents deviation of the target pitch.
3	
Close the Tuner window.
Checking the Balance
Now that the guitar is tuned, you can practice the performance and make sure you can 
hear yourself and the other instruments comfortably.
1	
Press the Spacebar to start playback, and play along with the song. If the guitar is now 
too loud or too soft in comparison to the other tracks, use the volume slider in the 
Guitar track header to adjust the monitoring level, or drag the volume fader on the 
Guitar channel strip in the Inspector. 
The track header’s volume slider and the channel strip’s volume fader adjust the moni-
toring and playback level, but they do not alter the recording level.
2	
Press the Spacebar to stop playback.

Recording a Single Track    71
Recording Audio
You have set the desired sample rate and bit depth, adjusted the recording and monitoring 
levels, inserted a plug-in to emulate the sound of a guitar amp, and tuned the instrument. 
You are now ready to start recording.
Let’s record a guitar part from bar 13 to bar 17.
1	
In the lower half of the ruler, click at bar 13.
The playhead is positioned at bar 13. In the control bar’s LCD display, make sure the 
playhead position is exactly bar 13, beat 1, div 1, tick 1. If you need to adjust the posi-
tion of the playhead, drag it left or right.
2	
In the control bar, click the Record button (or press R).
The playhead and the LCD display in the control bar both turn red to indicate that 
Logic is recording. The playhead jumps one bar earlier and gives you a four-beat 
count-in with an audible metronome click before the recording starts. A new red 
region is created behind the playhead on the record-enabled track, and you can see 
the recording’s waveform drawn in as you play or sing.

72    Recording Audio
NOTE ▶ ​By default, the metronome automatically turns on during recording, and you 
get a four-beat count-in (in the control bar, the Count-in and Metronome buttons are 
enabled). You will learn how to alter both the metronome and the count-in settings 
later in this lesson.

After you’ve recorded a few bars, in the control bar, click the Stop button (or press the 
Spacebar).
www.ebook3000.com

Recording a Single Track    73
The new recording, Guitar#01, appears as a blue-shaded audio region. To the name 
of the track, Logic appends the number of the recording. Note that this new region 
is selected, which makes listening to it easy using the “Play from Selection” key 
command.
4	
Press Shift-Spacebar.
The playhead jumps to the beginning of the selected region and playback starts. 
5	
Stop playback. 
If you are not happy with your new recording, you can delete it and start over.
6	
Press Delete.
A Delete alert appears with two choices:
▶
▶Delete—The audio region is removed from the Tracks area, and the audio file is 
removed from the Project Audio Browser. In the Finder, the audio file is moved 
from inside the project package to the Trash.
▶
▶Keep—The audio region is removed from the Tracks area. The audio file stays in 
the All Files Browser and is still present inside the project package, allowing you 
to later drag it back to the workspace if necessary.
NOTE ▶ ​To find the audio files inside a project package, Control-click the project 
package in the Finder, choose Show Package Contents, and then navigate to Media > 
Audio Files.
This alert appears only when you try to delete a recording made since you most 
recently opened the project. When deleting an audio region that was previously 
recorded, the behavior corresponding to the Keep option is automatically applied and 
an alert does not appear.

74    Recording Audio
 Despite what the alert says, if you chose Delete and clicked OK by mistake, 
you can still choose Edit > Undo (or press Command-Z) to undo the operation (as 
long as you don’t empty the Trash).
You will keep your recording so you can experiment with recording additional takes 
in the next exercise. 
7	
In the Delete pop-up window, click Cancel.
Recording Additional Takes
When recording a live performance, musicians can make mistakes. Rather than deleting 
the previous recording and repeatedly recording until you get a flawless performance, you 
can record several takes (repeat performances of the same musical part), and later choose 
the best take, or even combine the best parts of each take to create a comp (composite take).
To preserve multiple takes in Logic, you can record new performances over previous ones. 
All the takes (including the original recording) will be placed into a take folder.
1	
Make sure the Guitar track is still record-enabled.
2	
Position the playhead on bar 13.
3	
In the control bar, click the Record button (or press R) to record a second take slightly 
longer than the first.
The new recording (in red) appears to be recorded over the previous blue audio region.

The take folder is named Guitar: Take 2, the name of the track appended with the 
name of the take it’s playing. By default, the take folder plays the most recent take you 
recorded, Take 2, in this case. The previous take, Take 1, is dimmed and muted.
NOTE ▶ ​If the recent take that you recorded is shorter than a take you recorded ear-
lier, the take folder is named Guitar: Comp A, and plays a comp made of the recent 
take and the end of the previous take.

The track is disarmed, and you can no longer hear the sound coming from input 1 on 
your audio interface.
The take folder now contains three takes. It plays back the most recent one, Take 3, 
while the two previous ones, Take 1 and Take 2, are muted.
MORE ​INFO ▶ ​You will examine take folders in more detail and learn to comp takes 
in Lesson 3.

At the top left of the Guitar take folder, click the disclosure triangle to close the folder. 
 You can also double-click a take folder to open or close it.
Recording Takes in Cycle Mode
Recording multiple takes can be very useful when you are both the engineer and the musi-
cian because switching from playing your instrument to operating Logic between each take 
isn’t always practical (and it can really destroy your creative vibe). Recording in Cycle mode 
allows you to repeatedly record a single section, thereby creating a new take for each pass 
of the cycle. When you stop recording, all the takes are saved inside a take folder.
1	
In the upper-half of the ruler, drag a cycle area from bar 5 to bar 9.
 You don’t have to position the playhead when recording in Cycle mode; 
recording automatically starts at the beginning of the cycle, after the count-in.
2	
Make sure the Guitar track is selected, and click Record (or press R).
The Guitar track is automatically record-enabled. The playhead jumps a bar ahead of 
the cycle for a one-measure count-in, and starts recording the first take. When it reaches 
bar 9, the end of the cycle area, it jumps back to bar 5 and starts recording a new take.

Recording Additional Takes    77
NOTE ▶ ​If no track is record-enabled, Logic automatically record-enables the selected 
track during recording.
Logic keeps looping the cycle area, recording new takes until you stop recording. 
Record two or three takes.
3	
Click Stop (or press the Spacebar).
All the takes recorded in Cycle mode are packed into a take folder. The Guitar track is 
automatically disabled for recording.
NOTE ▶ ​When you stop recording, if the recent take is shorter than a bar, Logic auto-
matically discards it. To keep the last take of a cycle recording, make sure you stop the 
recording more than one bar after the beginning of the cycle area.
4	
At the top left of the take folder, click the disclosure triangle.
The take folder closes.
5	
In the ruler, click the cycle area (or press C) to turn it off. 
Recording Multiple Tracks
You can use the same single-track techniques you’ve learned to record multiple tracks 
simultaneously. Doing so allows you to record several instruments at once, placing each 
instrument on a separate track, so that you can later adjust their volumes and stereo posi-
tions, or process them individually.

78    Recording Audio
You first create the desired number of tracks, making sure that each track is assigned to 
a different input number that corresponds to the input number on your audio interface 
where the microphone is plugged in.
NOTE ▶ ​Logic does not let you record-enable multiple tracks set to the same input 
number because you would record the same input on different tracks, and end up 
with redundant audio files. 
In the following exercise, you will record two mono tracks at the same time, which you 
can do using the built-in Mac audio interface. To record more than two tracks at once, 
you need an audio interface with more than two inputs. The exercise describes recording 
an acoustic guitar on Input 1 and a vocal microphone on Input 2.
NOTE ▶ ​To avoid the sound of the guitar bleeding into the vocal microphone or the 
sound of the vocals bleeding into the guitar microphone, the guitar player and the 
singer should be located in different rooms.
1	
At the bottom of the Tracks area, click the Guitar track header to ensure that the 
tracks you are about to create will be added below the Guitar track.
2	
Above the track headers, click the Add Tracks button (+) (or press Command-
Option-N) to open the New Tracks dialog.
3	
At the top of the New Tracks dialog, make sure the Audio track type is selected. 
4	
From the Input menu, choose Ascending.
When creating multiple tracks, choosing Ascending automatically sets the inputs (or 
outputs) to ascending settings. In this case, you will create two tracks, so the first will 
be assigned to Input 1 and the second to Input 2.

Recording Additional Takes    79
Make sure you took precautions to avoid feedback as explained at the beginning of 
this lesson; this time you will create record-enabled tracks.

Below the Output menu, select Record Enable.
6	
At the bottom of the New Tracks dialog, set “Number of tracks” to 2.
7	
Click Create (or press Return).
Two new tracks are added at the bottom of the Tracks area, and automatically 
assigned to the next available audio channels (Audio 8 and Audio 9). Their inputs are 
set to Input 1 and Input 2, and both are record-enabled.
 If you need to reassign a track’s input, click the Input slot on the track’s channel 
strip and choose the new input.
NOTE ▶ ​The number of inputs available in the Input menu depends on the audio 
interface selected as an input device in the Logic Audio preferences.

In the control bar, click the Go to Beginning button (or press Return). 
10	 Start recording.
The multitrack recording starts, and after a one-measure count-in, you see the red 
playhead appear to the left of the workspace, creating two red regions, one on each 
record-enabled track.
11	 After a few bars, stop recording.
You now have a new blue-shaded audio region on each track.
12	 In the Acoustic Gtr and Vocals track headers, click the R (Record Enable) buttons to 
disable recording for both tracks.
You can use the same procedure to simultaneously record as many tracks as needed. If 
the tracks already exist in the Tracks area, make sure you assign them the correct inputs, 
record-enable them, and start recording.
NOTE ▶ ​You can record multiple takes on multiple tracks the same way you previ-
ously recorded to a single track: Either return the playhead to the beginning of the 
first take and record a new take, or record multiple takes in Cycle mode.
Punching In and Out
When you want to correct a specific section of a recording—usually to fix a performance 
mistake—you can restart playback before the mistake, punch in to engage recording just 
before the section you wish to fix, and then punch out to stop recording immediately after 
the section while playback continues. A take folder is created, containing a comp that 
combines the old recording outside the punch-in/punch-out range with the new recording 
www.ebook3000.com

Punching In and Out    81
inside that range. This technique allows you to fix smaller mistakes in a recording while 
still listening to the continuity of the performance.
 Punching is nondestructive. At any time, you can open the take folder and 
select the original recording.
There are two punching methods: on the fly and automatic. Punching on the fly allows you 
to press a key to punch in and out while Logic plays, whereas automatic punching requires 
you to identify the autopunch area in the ruler before recording. Punching on the fly is fast 
but usually requires an engineer to perform the punch in and punch out while the musician 
is performing. Automatic punching is ideal for the musician-producer who is working alone.
Assigning Key Commands
To punch on the fly, you will use the Record Toggle command, which is unassigned by 
default. First, you’ll open the Key Commands window and assign Record Toggle to a key 
combination.
1	
Choose Logic Pro X > Key Commands > Edit (or press Option-K) to open the Key 
Commands window. Click the disclosure triangle next to Global Commands.

82    Recording Audio
The Key Commands window lists all available Logic commands and the keyboard 
shortcuts they are assigned to, if any.
 Many commands are unassigned by default. When looking for a specific 
functionality in Logic Pro X, open the Key Commands window, and try to locate the 
function using the search field. A command likely exists for that functionality that 
may or may not be assigned. 
2	
In the Command list, click the Record Toggle command. 
3	
Click Learn by Key Label.
When Learn by Key Label is selected, you can press a key, or a key plus a combination 
of modifiers (Command, Control, Shift, Option), to create a keyboard command for 
the selected function.
4	
Press R.
An alert indicates that the R key is already assigned to the Record command. You 
could click Replace to assign R to Record Toggle, but then Record would no longer be 
assigned to a keyboard shortcut. Instead, let’s use another key combination. 
5	
Click Cancel (or press Esc).

6	
Press Control-J.
Control-J is now listed in the Key column next to Record Toggle, indicating that the 
command was successfully assigned. 
 To unassign a key command, select the command, make sure Learn by Key 
Label is selected, and press Delete.
7	
Close the Key Commands window.
 To reset all key commands to their defaults, choose Logic Pro X > Key 
Commands > Presets > U.S. (or the language of your choice). 
Punching on the Fly
You will now use the Record Toggle key command you assigned in the previous exercise 
to punch on the Vocals track (the bottom track in your Tracks area). 
1	
In the Vocals track header, click the R button to record-enable the track.
When punching on the fly, you may first want to play the performance to determine 
which section needs to be re-recorded, and to be ready to punch in and out at the 
desired locations.
2	
Listen to the Vocals track and determine where you’re going to punch in and out.
3	
In the control bar, click the Go to Beginning button (or press Return).
4	
Click Play (or press the Spacebar) to start playback.
Position your fingers on the keyboard to be ready to press your Record Toggle key 
command when you reach the point where you want to punch in.

84    Recording Audio
NOTE ▶ ​To be able to punch on the fly, in the control bar, Control-click the Record 
button and make sure Allow Quick Punch-In is selected.
5	
Press Control-J (Record Toggle).
The playhead continues moving, but Logic is now recording a new take on top of the 
previous recording. Keep your fingers in position to be ready to punch out.
6	
Press Control-J again.
The recording stops while the playhead continues playing the project.
7	
Stop the playback.
On the Vocals track, a take folder was created. It contains your original recording 
(Take 1) and the new take (Take 2). A comp is automatically created (Comp A) that 
combines the original recording up to the punch-in point, the new take between the 
punch-in and punch-out points, and the original recording after the punch-out point.
8	
Listen to your Vocals track.
In the next exercise you will examine another punching technique, so let’s undo this 
recording. 
9	
Choose Edit > Undo Recording (or press Command-Z).
The take folder disappears and you once again see the Vocals#01 region on the Vocals track.
www.ebook3000.com

Punching In and Out    85
Punching on the fly is a great technique to use when the musician can focus on his per-
formance while the engineer takes care of punching in and out at the right times. On the 
other hand, if you worked alone through this exercise and tried to punch in and punch 
out while playing your instrument or singing, you realize how challenging it can be. When 
working alone, punching automatically is recommended.
Punching Automatically
To prepare for automatic punching, you enable the Autopunch mode and set the auto-
punch area. Setting the punch-in and punch-out points in advance allows you to focus 
entirely on your performance during recording.
First, you will customize the control bar to add the Autopunch button.
1	
Control-click the control bar, and choose Customize Control Bar and Display.
A dialog opens in which you can choose the buttons you would like to see in the con-
trol bar, and the information you’d like to see in its LCD display. 
2	
In the dialog’s Modes and Functions column, choose Autopunch to add the Auto-
punch button to the control bar.
NOTE ▶ ​The control bar is customized independently for each Logic project file, 
which allows you to show different buttons and displays depending on the specific 
needs of each project.
3	
Click the Autopunch button (or press Command-Control-Option-P).

86    Recording Audio
NOTE ▶ ​When the main window is not wide enough for the control bar to display all 
the buttons selected in the control bar customization dialog, you can click the chevron 
(>>) to the right of the mode buttons to access the hidden functions in a shortcut menu.
The ruler becomes taller to accommodate for the red autopunch area.
Autopunch area
The autopunch area defines the section to be re-recorded. You can define the auto-
punch area with more precision when you can clearly see where the mistakes are on 
the audio waveform.
 To toggle the Autopunch mode on and off, Command-click the lower half of 
the ruler. 
4	
Click the background of the workspace to deselect every region.
5	
On the Vocals track, click the Vocals#01 region to select it.
6	
Press Z.
Logic zooms in, and the selected region fills the workspace.
www.ebook3000.com

Punching In and Out    87
7	
Listen to the vocal recording and determine which section you’re going to fix.
Here we have a vocal recording in which the two first words of measure 2 need to be 
re-recorded. Listen while watching the playhead move over the waveform to deter-
mine which part of the waveform corresponds to the words you need to replace.
8	
Adjust the autopunch area so that it encompasses the area you want to re-record.
You can drag the edges of the autopunch area to resize it, or drag the entire area to 
move it. Red vertical guidelines help you align the punch-in and punch-out points 
with the waveform. You may need to zoom in closer to make sure you’re re-recording 
exactly what you want. 
9	
Control-Option-drag around the waveform below the autopunch area.
10	 Fine-tune the position of the autopunch area.
11	 Click Go to Beginning (or press Return).
12	 Click Record (or press R).

88    Recording Audio
Playback starts. In the control bar, the Record button blinks; Logic isn’t yet recording.
When the playhead reaches the punch-in point (the left edge of the autopunch area), 
the Record button turns solid red, and Logic starts recording a new take. 
When the playhead reaches the punch-out point (the right edge of the autopunch 
area), the recording stops but the playback continues.
13	 Stop playback.
A take folder Vocals: Comp A is created on the track. 
14	 Click the take folder to select it.
15	 Press Z.
www.ebook3000.com

Changing Recording Settings    89
Logic zooms out so you can see the entire take folder filling the workspace.
Just as when you punched on the fly in the previous exercise, a comp is automatically 
created that plays the original recording up to the punch-in point, inserts the new 
take between the punch-in and punch-out points, and continues with the original 
recording after the punch-out point.
16	 In the control bar, click the Autopunch button (or press Command-Control-Option-P) 
to disable Autopunch mode.
17	 At the top left of the take folder, click the disclosure triangle to close the take folder.
 You can speed up the Autopunch recording process by using the Marquee 
tool described in Lesson 3. When a marquee selection is present, starting a recording 
automatically turns on the Autopunch mode, and the autopunch area matches the 
marquee selection. 
Changing Recording Settings
Although you can immediately record audio with Logic Pro X, sometimes you’ll want to 
change its default recording settings. Some settings do not affect the quality of the audio 
recording, but can alter the behavior of your project during recording, or change the audio 
file format used for recordings. The next few exercises will show you how those settings 
affect the audio recording process, and how to modify them.
Setting the Count-In
The count-in is the time you have to prepare yourself and get in the groove before the 
actual recording begins.
1	
On the Vocals track at the bottom of the workspace, click the take folder to select it, 
and press Delete.

90    Recording Audio
An alert asks you to confirm the operation. If you were only experimenting and 
wanted to remove the files you recorded during the two previous punching exercises, 
you could delete them now. Selecting the “For all” option allows you to apply the 
Delete operation to all the selected files (meaning all the recordings inside the selected 
take folder), which expedites the process when you want to delete multiple files.
2	
Select the “For all” option, and click OK (or press Return).
The take folder is deleted, and all the audio files it contained are moved to the Trash.
3	
Go to the beginning of the project.
Until now, every time you pressed Record, the playhead jumped to the beginning of 
the previous measure so you could have a four-beat count-in. However, sometimes 
you may want to start recording without a count-in.
4	
In the control bar, click the Count-in button to turn off count-in.
5	
Start recording, and stop after a couple of bars.
The playhead starts from its current position, and Logic starts recording right away.
At other times, you may need a longer count-in, or you may want Logic to count-in 
for a specific number of beats.
6	
Press Command-Z to undo the recording.
The audio region is removed from the workspace, but the audio file is still in the project 
folder.
See the “Deleting Unused Audio Files” section later in this chapter to learn how to 
delete all unused recordings by using the Project Audio Browser.
7	
From the main menu, choose Record > Count-in > 2 Bars.
8	
Position the playhead at bar 5, and start recording.
The playhead jumps two bars ahead to bar 3, and playback starts. When the playhead 
reaches bar 5, Logic starts recording. 
www.ebook3000.com

Changing Recording Settings    91
NOTE ▶ ​In Logic a count-in always starts at the beginning of a bar, even when you 
start recording in the middle of a bar.
9	
Press Command-Z to undo the recording.
Setting the Metronome
By default, the metronome is turned off during playback and automatically plays during 
recording. In this exercise, you will change the default behaviors using the Metronome 
button and later go into the Metronome settings to adjust its sounds.
1	
In the control bar, click the Metronome button to turn it on.
2	
Start playback.
The metronome is on.
3	
Stop playback and start recording.
The metronome is on.
4	
While Logic is still recording, turn off the metronome.
The metronome is off.
5	
Stop recording.
The metronome is back on. You now have inverted the default behavior: The metro-
nome is on during playback and is automatically turned off during recording.
6	
In the control bar, Control-click the Metronome button, and deselect Click While Playing.
The metronome is now off regardless of whether you’re playing or recording.

92    Recording Audio
7	
Click the Metronome button to turn it back on.
8	
Control-click the Metronome button, and choose Metronome Settings.
The Metronome Settings window opens. There are settings for two metronomes: 
Audio Click (originally named Klopfgeist, which is German for Knocking Ghost, in 
earlier Logic versions), which you are using, and MIDI Click, which is now off.
NOTE ▶ ​If you want your metronome to play a specific sound on an external hard-
ware MIDI synthesizer, sampler, or drum machine, use the MIDI Click. From the Port 
menu, choose a MIDI Out port, and connect a MIDI cable from that MIDI Out port 
on the MIDI Interface to the MIDI In port on your hardware sampler/synthesizer.
Under the name of each metronome you can adjust the pitch and velocity of the notes 
playing on each bar and beat. You can play a sound on every division, which can be 
useful when working with very slow tempos.
9	
Go to the beginning of the song, start playback, and turn on the metronome.
The metronome sounds a little low compared to the drum loop on track 1. In fact, you 
can hear it only when no drum hit occurs on that beat. At the bottom of the Metronome 
Settings window, you can drag a couple of sliders to adjust the sound of the metronome.
www.ebook3000.com

Changing Recording Settings    93
10	 Drag the Volume slider all the way to the right.
Even with the volume turned all the way up, it’s challenging for a dry metronome 
sound to cut through a busy mix, and you still have to strain to hear it, especially 
starting at bar 5, where the bass and drums come in.
11	 Drag the Tonality slider slowly toward the right.
The metronome sound changes, and you can start hearing a pitch. Adjusting the 
tonality of the metronome is important: A pitched sound (slider to the right) will bet-
ter cut through a busy mix, but it will also bleed through the musician’s headphones 
into the microphone. A more muted sound (slider to the left) is more suitable for 
quiet mixes in which you can’t tolerate any metronome bleed.
12	 Adjust the metronome so that it is loud and clear.
When a project already contains a drum track, you may need the metronome only 
during the count-in to get into the groove before the song starts.
13	 At the top of the Metronome Settings window, under Options, select “Click while 
recording” and “Only during count-in.”
14	 Close the Settings window, go to the beginning of the project, and start recording.
You hear the metronome for two measures, and then it stops playing as the song and 
the recording start at bar 1.

94    Recording Audio
15	 Stop and undo the recording.
16	 Click the Metronome button to turn it off.
Choosing the I/O Buffer Size
When communicating with the audio interface, Logic does not receive or transmit just 
one sample at a time. It places a number of samples in an input buffer for recording, and 
an output buffer for monitoring. When a buffer is full, Logic processes or transmits the 
entire buffer. The larger the buffers, the less computing power is required from the CPU. 
The advantage of using larger input and output buffers is that the CPU has more time to 
calculate other processes such as instrument and effects plug-ins. The drawback to using a 
larger buffer is that you may have to wait a bit for the buffer to fill before you can monitor 
your signal. That means a longer delay between the original sound and the one you hear 
through Logic, a delay called roundtrip latency.
Usually, you want the shortest possible latency when recording and the most available 
CPU processing power when mixing, so that you can use more plug-ins. You can adjust 
the I/O buffer size depending on your situation.
1	
Choose Logic Pro X > Preferences > Audio.
The Audio preferences pane opens. The default I/O Buffer Size is 128 Samples, which 
should have a latency below 10 ms (milliseconds) for most devices.
NOTE ▶ ​The driver used by your audio interface also influences the roundtrip latency. 
Depending on the audio device selected in your Audio preferences, you may see dif-
ferent latencies for the same I/O buffer size. When choosing a different audio device, 
make sure you click Apply Changes to update the Resulting Latency value displayed. 
2	
From the I/O Buffer Size pop-up menu, choose 32.
The latency is now shorter.
www.ebook3000.com

Changing Recording Settings    95
NOTE ▶ ​Sound travels at roughly one foot per millisecond, so a guitar player whose 
ear is five feet from his guitar amp’s speaker will also hear notes five milliseconds after 
playing them.
3	
Close the Preferences window.
The Core Audio engine is initialized with a 32-samples I/O buffer.
To monitor the impact of the I/O buffer size on the CPU, you need to customize the 
control bar to display the CPU meter.
4	
In the control bar, click the note and metronome icons to the left of the LCD display, 
and choose Custom.
The LCD display now displays more information, including CPU and HD meters to 
the right.
5	
Double-click the CPU or HD meter.
The CPU/HD window appears with more detailed meters. If your Mac has a multi-
core CPU, you can see a meter for each core.

96    Recording Audio
6	
Start playback at bar 13. 
NOTE ▶ ​Depending on your Mac computer’s CPU, you may not see the same number 
of cores or the same amount of activity on the meters. 
One of the cores is working quite hard. As the CPU works harder, you might hear 
pops and crackles while the song plays. When playing the project becomes too much 
work for the CPU, playback stops and you will see a System Overload alert.
7	
In the Audio preferences, set the I/O Buffer Size to 1024.
Note that a longer resulting latency is displayed below the menu.
8	
Click Apply Changes.
The Core Audio engine is initialized with a 1024-samples I/O buffer. 
www.ebook3000.com

Changing Recording Settings    97
9	
Start playback at bar 13.
The CPU meter hits much lower. It doesn’t have to work as hard with the larger buf-
fer size. However, if you try to record audio with that setting, you will hear a delay 
between the notes you play and the notes you hear. That’s latency. If you intend to do 
more audio recordings, find the lowest I/O buffer size setting that still allows clean 
monitoring.
NOTE ▶ ​Some audio effect plug-ins can also introduce latency. Choose Record > Low 
Latency Mode to automatically bypass those plug-ins. 
Choosing the Recording File Type
Logic can record in three digital audio file formats: AIFF (the most commonly used audio 
file format on Mac computers), Broadcast Wave File (BWF or WAVE), and Core Audio 
Format (CAF). All three formats record the same audio data, so the sound quality is the 
same between them; but each format has its own features. For example, Apple Loops can 
be CAF or AIFF files; CAF is practically unlimited in file size so it can be used for very 
large audio files; and BWF can contain timestamps.
The Audio Engineering Society recommends using BWF for most applications.

In the Audio preferences, click the General tab.

98    Recording Audio
2	
Set the Recording File Type to WAVE (BWF).
3	
Close the Preferences window.
From now on, any new audio recorded in Logic will create BWF files.
Deleting Unused Audio Files
The Project Audio Browser shows all the audio files and audio regions that have been 
imported or recorded in your project. During a recording session, the focus is on capturing 
the best possible performance, and you may want to avoid burdening yourself with the deci-
sion making that comes with deleting bad takes. You may also have several unused audio 
files in the Project Audio Browser that make the project package (or folder) bigger than it 
needs to be.
In this next exercise, you will select and delete all unused audio files from your hard drive.

NOTE ▶ ​Resizing, cutting, or copying regions in the workspace is called nondestructive 
editing. The audio data in the audio file stays intact, and the regions merely point to 
different sections of the audio file. You will learn more about nondestructive editing in 
Lesson 3.

In the workspace, select any audio regions you don’t want to keep, and press Delete.
The regions are removed from the workspace, but their parent audio files are still 
present in the Project Audio Browser.

At the lower left of the Browser, click the Prelisten button.
All selected regions play in sequence (from top to bottom), and you can see a small 
white playhead that travels through the regions. 
 In the Project Audio Browser, to play a region from a specific point, click and 
hold down the mouse button over its waveform at the desired location. 
Once you feel satisfied that the selected audio files do not contain any useful material, 
you can delete them.

You are now ready to tackle many recording situations: You can record a single track or 
multiple tracks, add new takes in a take folder, and fix mistakes by punching on the fly or 
automatically. You know where to adjust the sample rate and bit depth, as well as under-
standing which settings affect the behavior of the software during a recording session. 
And you can trim the fat off your projects by deleting unused audio files—which will 
save disk space, and download and upload time should you wish to collaborate with other 
Logic users over the Internet.

Audio engineers have always looked for new ways to edit recordings. In 
the days of magnetic recording, they used razor blades to cut pieces of 
a recording tape, and then connected those pieces with special adhesive 
tape. They could create a smooth transition (or crossfade) between two 
pieces of magnetic tape by cutting at an angle.
Digital audio workstations revolutionized audio. The waveform dis-
played on the screen is a visual representation of the digital audio 
recordings stored on the hard disk. The ability to read that waveform 
and manipulate it using the Logic editing tools is the key to precise and 
flexible audio editing.
In this lesson, you will edit audio regions nondestructively in the work-
space and the Audio Track Editor, and add fades and crossfades. You 
will open a take folder and use Quick Swipe Comping to create a single 
composite take. Finally, you’ll apply destructive audio editing in the 
Sample Editor to reverse a guitar recording.
Even as your ability to read waveforms and use the Logic editing tools 
develops, never forget to use your ears and trust them as the final judge 
of your work.

Lesson 3

104    Editing Audio
Assigning Mouse Tools
Until now, you have exclusively worked with the default tools. You have also used key-
board modifiers such as Control-Option to choose the Zoom tool, and changed the 
pointer to tools such as the Resize or Loop tools. When editing audio in the workspace, 
you will need to access even more tools.
In the Tracks area (and in various editors), two menus are available to assign the Left-click 
tool and the Command-click tool.
Left-click tool
Command-click tool
Previewing and Naming Regions
During recording sessions, helping the talent produce the best possible performance often 
takes priority over secondary tasks such as naming regions. In the aftermath of such ses-
sions, when you don’t know what musical material is contained in the regions on a track, 
taking the time to preview those tracks and give them descriptive names will help prepare 
for an efficient editing session.
In this exercise, you will assign tools to the mouse pointer. You will use the Solo tool to pre-
view the audio regions on the new Guitar track, and apply the Text tool to rename them.
1	
Open Logic Pro X Files > Lessons > 03 Get Dancing.
2	
In the Tracks area title bar, click the Left-click Tool menu, and choose the Solo tool.
www.ebook3000.com

Assigning Mouse Tools    105
When placed over a region, the mouse pointer has a little S next to it indicating that 
it’s a Solo tool. You can hear a region play back in solo mode by placing the Solo tool 
over the region and holding down the mouse button.
3	
With the Solo tool over the Guitar track (track 7), hold down the mouse button at the 
beginning of the Guitar #10.4 region.
In the control bar, the Solo button comes on, and the LCD display and the playhead 
both turn yellow. The region is soloed, and you can play back starting from the loca-
tion where you placed the Solo tool.
 You can also drag the Solo tool to scrub the region. You can change the 
playback speed or direction by dragging the Solo tool to the right or to the left. This 
technique can be useful when you’re trying to locate a specific piece of audio material 
within a region.
You can hear that the guitar is playing single, muted notes, so you will give it a 
descriptive name based on those notes.
4	
Click the Command-click Tool menu, and choose the Text tool.
Your Left-click Tool menu now displays the Solo tool, and the Command-click Tool 
menu displays the Text tool. If you hold down Command when your pointer is over a 
region, it changes to the Text tool.
5	
Command-click the Guitar#10.4 region.
A text field appears, in which you can enter a new name for the region.
6	
Type Muted Single Notes, and press Return to rename that region.

106    Editing Audio
7	
Farther to the right on the same Guitar track, using the Solo tool, hold down the 
mouse button in the Guitar take folder at bar 13.
You can hear some dead notes at the beginning of this take folder, and about a bar of 
funk rhythm guitar (in bar 14). You will edit this take folder later in this lesson.
8	
Command-click the take folder, and rename it Funk Rhythm.
9	
Using the Solo tool, listen to each one of the three small regions at the end of the Guitar 
track.
 To make sure you start playback from the beginning of each region, Option-
click the region with the Solo tool.
In those regions, the guitar sustains chords, so you will name the regions after the 
chord names. When naming multiple regions, you may find it cumbersome to repeat-
edly hold down Command, so let’s assign the Text tool to the Left-click tool.
Instead of moving back and forth from the workspace to the tool menus in the Tracks 
area menu bar, you can press T to open the Tool menu at the current pointer position.
10	 Press T (Show Tool Menu).
NOTE ▶ ​If you press T and the Tool menu does not open at your pointer position, 
read “Using the U.S. Key Command Preset” in “Getting Started” before you continue. 
This section of “Getting Started” will teach you how to make your key commands 
consistent with those used throughout this book.
www.ebook3000.com

Assigning Mouse Tools    107
A Tool menu appears at the pointer position. This key command will save you a lot of 
trips to the title bar.
NOTE ▶ ​Different areas of the main window (such as the Tracks area or the editors) 
have their own sets of tools. You can change an area’s tools in the Tool menus in its 
title bar, or by positioning the pointer over that area and pressing T.
11	 In the Tool menu, choose the Text tool.
 When the Tool menu is open, you can press the key command listed to the 
right of a tool to assign that tool to the Left-click tool.
12	 Rename the last three regions on the Guitar track Ab chord, Bb chord, and Cm chord.
You can also Command-click a tool in the pop-up Tool menu to assign it to the Com-
mand-click tool.
13	 Press T to reopen the Tool menu, and Command-click the Marquee tool.
Now, let’s return the Left-click tool to the Pointer tool.
14	 Press T twice.
The Tool menu opens and closes, and the Left-click tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
Both tools are back to their default assignments: the Pointer tool for the Left-click 
tool and the Marquee tool for the Command-click tool.
 If you have a two-button mouse, you can assign a third tool to the right 
mouse button by choosing Logic Pro X > Preferences > General and clicking the 
Editing tab. From the Right Mouse Button pop-up menu, choose “Is Assignable to 
a Tool.” The Right-click Tool menu will appear to the right of the two existing Tool 
menus.
Now that you know how to choose the best tool for the job, you’re ready to start editing 
the audio regions on the Guitar track.

108    Editing Audio
Editing Regions in the Workspace
Editing audio regions in the workspace is nondestructive. Regions are merely pointers that 
identify parts of an audio file. When you cut and resize regions in the workspace, only 
those pointers are altered. No processing is applied to the original audio files, which remain 
untouched on your hard disk. As a result, editing in the workspace provides a lot of flexibil-
ity and room for experimentation because you can always adjust your edits at a later date.
In this next exercise, you will edit the Muted Single Notes region on the Guitar track. You 
will first resize the region to make it exactly four-measures long, and then you’ll use the 
Marquee tool to select some of the audio material in the region and copy it later in the track.
Since you’ll be working with whole bars, you’ll first choose snap modes to make the 
mouse pointer snap to bar lines on the grid, making the editing session easier and faster.
1	
At the top of the Tracks area, from the Snap menu, choose Bar.
NOTE ▶ ​If the Tracks area is not wide enough to display the Snap menu in its menu 
bar, click the action pop-up menu that appears, and choose Snap > Bar.
In the Snap menu, a checkmark appears in front of the modes you choose.
2	
From the Snap menu, choose Snap Regions to Absolute Value.
3	
On the Guitar track (track 7), resize the Muted Single Notes region to exactly 4 0 0 0.
www.ebook3000.com

Editing Regions in the Workspace    109
Drag the Resize tool toward the left until it snaps to bar 4.
 To disable snapping when using various tools in the workspace, hold down 
Control or (for even greater precision) Control-Shift.
4	
Listen from the beginning of the song to the end of the Muted Single Notes region.
You will now repeat the simple motif in the last two bars of the Muted Single Notes 
region a couple more times, from bars 9 to 13 where the synthesizers play.
The Command-click tool is now the Marquee tool, and the Left-click tool is the 
Pointer tool. This is a very powerful tool combination when editing audio in the 
workspace. You can select a section of an audio region with the Marquee tool, and 
move or copy that selection using the Pointer tool.
5	
Command-drag the waveform in the Muted Single Notes region from bar 7 to bar 9.
The section you selected with the Marquee tool is highlighted.
6	
Press the Spacebar to play the selection.
 When a marquee selection is present, playback starts at the beginning and 
stops at the end of that marquee selection, even when Cycle mode is turned on.
The playhead jumps to bar 7 and plays the selection. It corresponds exactly to the 
two-bar pattern of the guitar you are going to copy.
7	
Option-drag the marquee selection to bar 9, releasing the mouse button first followed 
by the Option key.

110    Editing Audio
Option-dragging a marquee selection automatically divides, copies, and pastes the 
selection to a new location regardless of region boundaries. In this example, the two-
bar guitar pattern is copied and pasted at bar 9.
Remember to release the mouse button first and the Option key second. When the 
mouse button is released, the original region is automatically restored.
8	
Option-drag the new two-bar Muted Single Notes.3 region to bar 11.
9	
Listen from the beginning of the song to the Funk Rhythm take folder at bar 13.
The guitar plays a melodic riff with high notes when it first comes in, and then it 
plays more discretely throughout the following sections leaving room for the two 
synths to shine.
Still, you can bring back a little bit of the excitement just before the breakdown at bar 13.
10	 In the first Muted Single Notes region, Command-drag from bar 6 to bar 7.
11	 Option-drag the marquee selection to bar 12.
As you copy the new region to bar 12, the two-bar region that existed at bar 11 is 
trimmed down to a one-bar region to make space for the new region.
12	 From the Snap menu, choose Smart.
www.ebook3000.com

Comping Takes    111
13	 Listen to this new edit.
This last region brings back a welcome variation to the monotonous pattern that the 
guitar has been playing for the past five bars, returning in time to lead to the break in 
the next section.
Now you know how to select the desired material within a region and move or copy that 
material anywhere on the track. You could, for example, move or copy a single drum hit, or 
a single word in a vocal performance, to replace another one that doesn’t sound as good.
Comping Takes
In the previous lesson, you recorded several takes of a guitar performance and packed 
them into a take folder. Now you will learn how to preview those individual takes and 
assemble a composite take by choosing sections from multiple takes, a process called 
comping.
Comping techniques are useful when you have recorded several takes of the same musi-
cal phrase, each with its good and bad qualities. In the first take, the musician may have 
messed up the beginning but played the ending perfectly; and in the following take, he 
nailed the beginning and made a mistake at the end. You can create a perfectly played 
comp using the beginning of the second take and the ending of the first take.
You can use the same comping techniques to create a single musical passage from multiple 
musical ideas. As they improvise in the studio, musicians will often record a few takes and 
later comp the best ideas of each performance into a new, virtual performance.
Previewing the Takes
Before you start comping, you need to get familiar with the takes you are going to comp. 
While doing so, you will assign the takes different colors to help distinguish between 
them, and then decide which part of which take you will use.
1	
At bar 13 on the Guitar track, double-click the take folder to open it.
2	
Press Z to zoom in on the selection.

112    Editing Audio
The selected take folder and its takes fill the workspace. The take folder is on the Gui-
tar track, and the three takes it contains are on lanes below the Guitar track. Take 3 
at the top is selected and is the take currently playing. The other takes are dimmed to 
indicate that they are muted.
Take folder pop-up menu
Quick Swipe Comping button
You’ll see three buttons at the upper left of a take folder:
▶
▶The disclosure button allows you to open or close the take folder.
▶
▶The Take Folder pop-up menu displays the current take number (or the current 
comp letter) and contains options to manage your takes and comps.
▶
▶The Quick Swipe Comping button allows you to toggle Quick Swipe Comping 
on and off to edit the individual takes in the same way you would edit regions 
on a track.
After those three buttons, you’ll see the name you previously gave your take folder 
(Funk Rhythm) followed by the comp name (Take 3).
Let’s assign each take a unique color.
www.ebook3000.com

Comping Takes    113
3	
Press Option-C to open the Color palette.
 The Color palette displays a white frame around the color(s) of the selected 
region(s). This is useful when you need to assign other regions the same color.
4	
Click Take 1 to select it.
5	
In the Color palette, click a purple color square.
Take 1 is purple.
You will keep the blue color for Take 2, and choose a new color for Take 3.
6	
Click Take 3, and in the Color palette, click a green square.
7	
Close the Color palette.
8	
Press C to turn on Cycle mode, and press Command-U to make the locators match 
the selected take.
9	
In the Guitar track header, click the S (Solo) button, or make sure the Guitar track is 
selected and press S.

114    Editing Audio
10	 Press the Spacebar.
The selected take, Take 3, plays. There’s really only one useable bar in this whole take, 
the second bar (between bars 14 and bar 15).
11	 Stop playback, and listen to Take 2.
This time the first bar sounds good, but the second bar is rather messy; the third 
bar sounds good, and then the guitar player plays the wrong chord and stops. So far, 
between Take 2 and Take 3, you have just enough material to cover the first three bars 
of the breakdown, and you’re missing the fourth bar.
NOTE ▶ ​Logic can also continue playing in Cycle mode as you select different takes. 
When you do so, a brief delay will occur as Logic switches playback between takes.
12	 Listen to Take 1.
This time the guitarist misses the entire beginning, but gives a good performance in 
the fourth bar of the breakdown.
Although each take is a very poor performance, you have all the material you need to 
create a comp take that will sound good. You will use the following sections of each take:
▶
▶Take 1: The fourth bar
▶
▶Take 2: The first and third bars
▶
▶Take 3: The second bar
Comping the Takes
Now you’ll assemble the best sections of each take to create a single, flawless composite 
take using the Quick Swipe Comping feature. You will swipe your mouse across the parts 
of the takes you want to hear in your comp.
1	
Click Take 2 to select it.
The entire take is selected, and its color and name are displayed in the take folder.
2	
Click Take 3 at bar 14, and drag to the right to select one measure.
www.ebook3000.com

Comping Takes    115
The mouse pointer does not automatically snap to the grid when Quick Swipe Comping, 
but snapping would really help you edit this kind of rhythmic material.
3	
At the top of the Tracks area, from the Snap menu, choose “Snap Quick Swipe Comp-
ing to Absolute Values.”
Let’s undo the previous selection and try repeating that operation with snapping 
turned on.

116    Editing Audio
4	
Choose Edit > Undo Edit Comp (or press Command-Z).
5	
Click Take 3 at bar 14 and drag right to select one measure.
This time the mouse pointer snaps, making it easier to select exactly one measure.
6	
Click Take 1 at bar 16 and drag to select one measure.
Notice that in the take folder on the Guitar track, the waveform and its background 
color match the sections of the selected takes. Your comp name, Comp A, now 
appears next to the take folder name, and the letter A is displayed in the Take Folder 
pop-up menu (to the right of the disclosure triangle).
www.ebook3000.com

Comping Takes    117
NOTE ▶ ​A take folder can contain multiple comps you can choose from the Take 
Folder pop-up menu. An easy way to start a new comp is to Option-click a take to 
select it, and start comping again.
7	
Listen to your comp.
While each individual guitar take was pretty poor, you’ve edited them together into a 
good sounding guitar part. There is, however, a lingering noise present at the end of 
Take 2 you can delete.
8	
At the end of Take 2, click the last section highlighted in blue.
The upper part of the clicked section is white, indicating that the section is selected.
9	
Press Delete to remove the selected section.
10	 From the Take Folder pop-up menu, choose Flatten.
The take folder is replaced by the current comp. The selected sections of the takes in 
the folder are now replaced by audio regions, and crossfades are displayed at the junc-
tions between regions.

118    Editing Audio
11	 Click the Guitar track’s Solo button (or press S) to unsolo the track and listen to the 
result.
12	 Turn off Cycle mode.
You now have a flawless funk rhythm guitar performance during the break. The cross-
fades, automatically added between edit points during the comping, ensure smooth tran-
sitions between the regions. You will learn how to apply and adjust your own fades and 
crossfades in the following two exercises.
Adding Fades and Crossfades
When editing audio, you usually want to avoid abrupt transitions on edit points: the 
region boundaries and the junctions between regions. You can use nondestructive fades in 
the workspace to create smooth transitions.
Adding a Fade-Out
The very last region on the Guitar track ends abruptly, before the guitar chord has finished 
its natural decay. You will now add a fade-out to make that last chord end more naturally.
1	
Solo the Guitar track (track 7).
2	
At the end of the Guitar track (at bar 21), listen to the three regions containing guitar 
chords.
You can hear odd blip sounds at the edit points: the beginning of the first region, the 
junction between the regions, and the end of the last region. The clicks are exacer-
bated by the reverb in the Amp Designer plug-in on the channel strip. Let’s turn off 
that plug-in.
3	
In the inspector, on the Guitar channel strip, place the mouse pointer over the Amp 
Designer plug-in, then click the power button that appears to the left of the plug-in slot.
The plug-in is dimmed to indicate that it’s turned off.
www.ebook3000.com

Adding Fades and Crossfades    119
4	
Just above the Amp Designer plug-in, turn off the Compressor plug-in.
5	
Listen again to the three guitar regions at bar 21.
You can now clearly hear the clicks. The third region, a C minor chord, ends abruptly 
and the sustain tail of that chord does not sound natural.
6	
Press T to open the Tool menu at the mouse pointer position.
7	
Click the Fade tool, or press 0 (zero), to assign it as the Left-click tool.
8	
Drag the Fade tool over the end part of the Cm chord region, starting about halfway 
into the region.
To apply a fade, always ensure that you drag over a region’s boundary, or nothing will 
happen. You can create fades only over region boundaries. Here, the shaded rectangle 
should cover the end of the region.
A fade-out is created. The position where you started dragging determines the length 
of the fade-out.
9	
Listen to the fade-out.
The level of the guitar chord progressively decreases until it’s silent at the end, effec-
tively removing the click at the end of the Cm chord region.
You can now adjust the fade’s length and curve to fine-tune its sound.

120    Editing Audio
10	 Place the Fade tool on the left side of the fade, and drag toward the left to start the 
fade-out at the beginning of the Cm chord region.
11	 Place the Fade tool in the middle of the fade, and drag to the right to curve the fade.
The fade is curved in the direction you drag.
12	 Unsolo the Guitar track, and in the inspector, turn on the Compressor and the Amp 
Designer.
13	 Listen to the entire outro section starting at bar 21.
The guitar and the piano fade out simultaneously at the end of the song, which now 
sounds cleaner and smoother.
14	 Press T twice.
The Left-click tool is reassigned as the Pointer tool.
Adding Fades to Remove Clicks
In this exercise, you will add very short fades and crossfades to eliminate click sounds that 
occur at edit points on the final three regions on the Guitar track.
1	
Solo the Guitar track, and in the Inspector, turn off the Compressor and Amp 
Designer.
2	
Listen to the Ab chord region at bar 21, starting playback slightly before the begin-
ning of that region.
www.ebook3000.com

Adding Fades and Crossfades    121
You can hear a click at the beginning of the region. Let’s zoom in to take a closer look 
at the waveform.
3	
Control-Option-drag around the left edge of the Ab chord region.
You may need to zoom in a few more times to clearly see the shape of the waveform.
To add fades using the Pointer tool, you can Control-Shift-drag over the region 
boundary.
4	
Control-Shift-click inside the region, and drag toward the left over the region start.
A fade-in is added.

122    Editing Audio
5	
Zoom out and listen to the fade-in.
The click sound at the beginning of the Ab chord region disappeared.
 To compare the sound before and after the edit, choose Edit > Undo 
Crossfade Edit (or press Command-Z) to undo the previous edit, and choose Edit > 
Redo Crossfade Edit (or press Command-Shift-Z) to reapply that edit.
6	
Listen to the junction between the first two regions of the outro, Ab chord and Bb 
chord. You can hear a click sound at the edit point.
7	
Zoom in closer to the junction between the two regions, and Control-Shift-drag over 
the junction.
A crossfade is added at the junction between the two regions.
 You can change the curve of a crossfade by placing the mouse pointer on the 
crossfade and dragging toward the left or right.
8	
Zoom out and listen to the crossfade.
The click sound at the junction between the regions disappeared.
When adding short fades or crossfades to avoid clicks, you don’t really need to zoom 
in and look at the waveform. All you need is a very short fade at the edit point to 
smooth the transition.
www.ebook3000.com

Adding Fades and Crossfades    123
There’s one click left to remove, at the junction between the two final regions on the 
track, a Bb chord and a Cm chord. This time you will add the crossfade using the 
parameters in the Region inspector to avoid zooming in and out.
9	
Click the Bb chord region.
10	 At the top of the inspector, in the Region inspector, select the More option to display 
the fade parameters.
11	 Double-click to the right of the Fade Out parameter to activate the data field, and enter 5.
A five-millisecond fade-out is added at the end of the selected region.
12	 Click the Type parameter value, and choose EqP (Equal Power Crossfade).
In the workspace you can see that the fade-out at the end of the selected region is 
replaced by a crossfade.
NOTE ▶ ​While X, EqP, and X S crossfades offer different shapes, the shape of EqP 
crossfades keeps the volume of the sound constant throughout the fade, which makes 
EqP the best choice for most situations.

124    Editing Audio
13	 Unsolo the Guitar track, turn the Compressor and Amp Designer back on, and listen 
to the outro.
After editing a section, you may have many small regions with fades between them. 
You can choose to keep those small regions with the fades, so you can readjust the 
edits later. However, if you’re ready to commit and would rather deal with a single 
audio region for the entire section, you can join the regions to render your edits into a 
new audio file.
14	 Select the A flat, B flat, and C minor chord regions.
15	 Choose Edit > Join > Regions (or press Command-J).
An alert asks you to confirm the creation of a new audio file.
16	 Click Create.
A new audio region is created in place of the selected regions and their fades.
17	 Using the Text tool, rename the new region Gtr chords, then revert to the Pointer tool.

Editing Regions in the Audio Track Editor    125
Editing Regions in the Audio Track Editor
For some editing, you need to clearly see the grid behind the regions, or have the bar ruler 
displayed directly on top of the regions you’re editing. Zooming and scrolling in the work-
space can help to an extent; however, when you want to edit the regions of a single track, 
you can use the Audio Track Editor to focus on that track without changing the zoom 
level of the Tracks area.
Importing Audio Files Using the All Files Browser
You will now import a new audio file to the project: a white noise sound effect you will 
use later to accentuate the transition between song sections at bar 17.

The wave.aif file plays. It’s a sound effect of white noise rising and falling in level, 
similar to the sound of an ocean wave.
7	
Drag wave.aif to the bottom of the workspace at bar 13.
A new track is created, and the wave audio region is added at bar 13. The audio file 
was recorded at a low level, and its waveform is rather flat. Depending on your zoom 
level, you may not even see a waveform at all. In the next exercise, you will zoom into 
the waveform so you can see it clearly.

Editing Regions in the Audio Track Editor    127
Using the Audio Track Editor
You will now continue editing the wave region nondestructively, but this time in the 
Audio Track Editor, which allows you to clearly see the grid and the ruler above the 
regions without having to change the zoom level of the Tracks area.
1	
In the workspace, double-click the wave region to open the editors area.
2	
At the top of the editors area, click Track.
The Audio Track Editor opens, displaying the wave track and its single region.
 To make the Audio Track Editor taller, place the mouse pointer between the 
Tracks area and the Audio Track Editor and drag up.
3	
Press Z.
The wave region fills the Audio Track Editor. You can clearly see the ruler just above 
the waveform, with vertical grid lines displayed under the waveform.
You can see that the wave region is a stereo audio region because it has two interleaved 
circles next to its name, and two waveforms are displayed in the Audio Track Editor.

128    Editing Audio
NOTE ▶ ​In the workspace, when zoomed out vertically, stereo audio regions appear 
as a single waveform. A rectified waveform above the center line represents the left 
channel while another rectified waveform under the center line represents the right 
channel. As you reach a certain vertical zoom level, two waveforms are displayed, one 
for each channel.
Let’s zoom in on the waveform.
4	
At the top right of the Audio Track Editor, click the Waveform Zoom button.
The waveform is a little taller. Let’s zoom in even closer.
5	
Click and hold down the Waveform Zoom button until the vertical zoom slider 
appears, and then drag up until you can clearly see the waveform.
NOTE ▶ ​Another Waveform Zoom button at the upper right of the Tracks area allows 
you to adjust the vertical zoom level of audio region waveforms in the workspace.

In the Audio Track Editor, drag the wave region to the right until the highest point on 
the waveform is aligned with bar 17.
In the workspace, the wave audio region is moved accordingly.
7	
In the Tracks area, position the playhead before the wave region, and press the Space-
bar to play the results.
The climax of the wave sound is now perfectly aligned with the transition between 
song sections at bar 17. The effect would sound even better if the rise before bar 17 
were shorter.

Stop playback.
9	
In the Audio Track Editor, place the mouse pointer at the lower left of the wave region 
until it turns into the Resize tool. Then drag to the right so the region starts at bar 16.
The region is now trimmed. Let’s add a fade-in.

130    Editing Audio
10	 In the Audio Track Editor, Control-Shift-click the waveform at bar 17 and drag 
toward the left over the region start.
A fade-in is added. All the edits you perform in the Audio Track Editor are reflected 
in the workspace.
11	 In the control bar, click the Editors button (or press E) to close the Audio Track 
Editor.
12	 Listen to the song from the beginning of the breakdown at bar 11.
The wave sound now rises rapidly in the last bar of the breakdown, and decays slowly 
in the next section, which works better for this transition.

Editing Files in the Audio File Editor    131
Editing Files in the Audio File Editor
The Audio File Editor allows you to perform destructive audio editing. Although nonde-
structively editing audio regions in the workspace and Audio Track Editor keeps the par-
ent audio file intact, processing an audio file in the Audio File Editor actually modifies the 
data contained in the audio file.
Playing an Audio Region Backward
You will now create a new region from the last chord of the Gtr chords region at the end 
of the Guitar track and convert it into a new audio file. You will then reverse the new 
audio file in the Audio File Editor to create a swelling sound you will use for the introduc-
tion of this song.
1	
On the Guitar track, Command-drag the last bar of the Gtr chords region to select it 
with the Marquee tool.
You will now copy that region to bar 4, the last bar of the introduction.
If bar 4 is not visible in the Tracks area, Option-drag the region to the left.

132    Editing Audio
2	
Release the mouse when the help tag displays Position: 4 1 1 1.
You have a new Gtr chord.3 region in the introduction you will reverse destructively 
in the Audio File Editor. However, this new region references the same audio file as 
the last region on the track, Gtr chords. If you destructively reverse the audio in this 
new region’s parent audio file, all regions referencing that parent file will have that 
audio reversed, including the Gtr chords region.
To avoid modifying the Gtr chords region at the end of the Guitar track, you will con-
vert this new Gtr chords.3 region into a new audio file.
3	
At bar 4, ensure that the new Gtr chords.3 region is still selected, and choose Edit > 
Convert > Audio Region to New Audio File (or press Command-Option-F).
In the Save As dialog, you can choose a filename and location for the new audio file. 
You will name the file but keep the default location (the audio files folder in the proj-
ect folder).
4	
Name the file Reversed Gtr, and click Save (or press Return).
A new Reversed Gtr region replaces the old Gtr chord.3 region. The new region refer-
ences the audio file you just saved, so editing it destructively will not affect the Gtr 
chords region at the end of the Guitar track.
5	
Double-click the Reversed Gtr region to open it in the Audio Track Editor.
6	
At the top of the Audio Track Editor, click File to open the Audio File Editor.

Choose Functions > Reverse (or press Control-Shift-R) to reverse the file.
NOTE ▶ ​Some or all of an audio file open in the Audio File Editor has to be selected 
for the operations in the Functions menu to be available. By default, the section of the 
file corresponding to the region you opened is selected. To apply an operation to only 
a section of the audio file, drag over that section with the Pointer tool to select it, and 
then choose the desired operation from the Audio File Editor menus.

Click the Play button (or press Control-Spacebar) to hear the results.
The guitar chord now slowly rises up from silence and ends at its peak level, which 
was formerly the attack of the original chord.
10	 Click the Editors button (or press E) to close the Audio File Editor.
11	 Press the Spacebar to listen to the introduction.
The swelling guitar chord sounds about right. However it’s still not in the perfect position 
because it overlaps the first notes of the bass. To get the full impact of the break at the 
end of the intro, the Reversed Gtr region should end exactly where the first Skyline Bass 
region starts. You will move the region to its correct position in the next exercise.
Aligning Audio
Accurately aligning audio material to the grid, or to other instruments in the song, is 
crucial to realizing a professional sounding song. No amounts of plug-ins, mixing, or mas-
tering techniques can fix a sloppy arrangement, so getting a tight sounding arrangement 
before moving on is important.
In the next two exercises, you will use two techniques to align audio in the workspace. 
First, you’ll use the anchor in the Audio File Editor to align the Reversed Gtr region you 
edited in the previous exercise. Second, you’ll use the Flex tool in the workspace to move 
individual notes within a region.
Using the Anchor
Audio regions have an anchor, which positions the region in the workspace. When you 
drag a region in the workspace, the anchor position is the position displayed in the help 
tag, and the anchor is used to snap the region to the grid.
By default, the anchor is located at the start point of an audio region. While this makes 
sense for most audio regions, sometimes the part of the audio region you want to align 
with the grid is not at the beginning of a region. To line up the attack of a reversed sound 
with the grid, you need to position the anchor on the attack (the loudest part, or ampli-
tude peak) near the end of the region.
In this exercise, you will position the region so that its anchor lines up with the beginning 
of the first region on the bass track.

Zoom in so you can comfortably see all tracks from bar 3 to bar 7.
You will now see how alignment guides can help you align a region with other regions 
on other tracks. In the next step, don’t worry about dragging the region to the wrong 
place, as you’ll be undoing the move later.
2	
On the Guitar track (track 3), slowly drag the Reversed Gtr region to the right.
As you drag the Reversed Gtr region, a yellow alignment guide helps you align the 
region you’re dragging with the beginnings or ends of regions on other tracks. How-
ever, the current line appears at the beginning of the region you’re dragging when you 
want to align the end.
 To toggle the alignment guides on and off, choose Edit > Alignment Guides.

Choose Edit > Undo Drag (or press Command-Z) to return the Reversed Gtr region 
to bar 4.

Click the Editors button (or press E) to open the Audio File Editor.
The anchor is located at the bottom of the Audio File Editor, on the Anchor lane 
below the waveform. It is completely to the left, at the beginning of the region.
5	
In the Audio File Editor, drag the anchor to the maximum amplitude on the wave-
form, almost at the end of the file.
6	
Click the Editors button (or press E) to close the Audio File Editor.
7	
On the Guitar track (track 7), slowly drag the Reversed Gtr region to the left until you 
see a yellow alignment guide at the beginning of the first region on the bass track.
www.ebook3000.com

Aligning Audio    137
This time the anchor of the Reversed Gtr region lines up with the alignment guides 
and snaps to the beginning of the first bass region.
8	
Play the introduction.
You can hear a click at the beginning of the Reversed Gtr region.
9	
Add a long fade-in to the Reversed Gtr region.
10	 Listen to the newly improved intro.
Now the swelling guitar chord sounds smooth. It catches the listener’s attention just before 
the bass first comes in, accentuating the effect of the break at the end of the introduction.
Using the Flex Tool
You will now import a guitar recording that was removed from the workspace, but kept in 
the Project Audio Browser. That guitar was removed because of timing issues, which you 
can now fix using the Flex tool.
1	
In the control bar, click the Browsers button (or press F).
2	
At the top of the browser, click the Project tab.
3	
In the Project Audio Browser, scroll all the way down, and then drag the Guitar Intro 
region to the Guitar track at bar 1.
4	
Click the Browsers button (or press F) to close the Project Audio Browser.
5	
Play the introduction that includes your new Guitar Intro region.
The guitarist is playing four dead notes (unpitched percussive sounds when the string 
wasn’t ringing), that cause a ringing in the vintage spring reverb in the guitar amp 
modeling plug-in.
The third note, at bar 2, sounds out of place, while the other notes play at the second 
and fourth beat of each bar, much as a snare would be heard in a drum pattern. You 
will move that third dead note to the second beat of bar 2.

138    Editing Audio
6	
Press T, and choose the Flex tool.
7	
Using the Flex tool, click anywhere on the Guitar Intro region.
The audio files used on the Guitar track are analyzed for transients. You may see a 
progress window very briefly.
NOTE ▶ ​When clicking an audio region using the Flex tool, Logic automatically 
chooses a flex mode and analyzes all audio files on the same track to detect their tran-
sients. You will learn more about flex modes and flex editing in Lesson 7.
8	
Zoom in closer on the Guitar Intro so that you can see the ruler above the waveform 
(or press Z).
9	
Place the Flex tool over the attack of the third note (at bar 2).
Depending on its position over the waveform, the Flex tool can perform different 
functions, indicated by different tool icons; so make sure that the tool is located pre-
cisely over the note’s attack and looks like the pointer icon in the preceding figure.
10	 Drag the Flex tool to the right to move the third guitar note to measure 2, beat 2.

Aligning Audio    139
11	 Play the introduction.
The dead notes in the first two bars now sound consistent.
The dead notes in this guitar region are still not located perfectly on the grid. If you 
wanted to take this a little further, you could set your snap mode to Beat, zoom in closer 
on the first guitar note, and use the Flex tool to drag it exactly on the beat. Then you’d 
repeat this operation on the second and fourth notes.
You now know how to read a waveform, identifying notes and their attacks to perform 
precise and clean edits. You acquired skills with a number of editing tools—such as the 
Marquee tool, Fade tool, Resize tool, Flex tool, take folders, and snap modes—that you 
will continue to use as you edit recordings and arrange projects.
Further, you can now accelerate your workflow by choosing the appropriate Left-click and 
Command-click tools for each job. As you produce more music in Logic, you will continue 
sharpening those skills in the course of becoming an increasingly proficient audio engineer.

In most popular modern music genres, drums are the backbone of the 
instrumentation. They provide the foundation for the tempo and the 
groove of the piece. For recording sessions in which the instruments 
are not tracked at the same time, drums are usually recorded or pro-
grammed first, so that the other musicians can record while listening to 
their rhythmic reference.
To meet today’s high production standards, producing drum tracks 
usually involves using several techniques, including live recording, 
programming, sampling, audio quantizing, and sound replacement. In 
Logic Pro X, you can speed up the process by taking advantage of the 
new Drummer feature along with its companion software instrument, 
Drum Kit Designer.
In this lesson, you will produce a virtual drum track to start producing 
a new imaginary indie-rock song. After selecting a genre and choos-
ing the best drummer for your project, you will adjust the drummer’s 
performance, making him play busier patterns or simpler ones, louder 
or softer, and changing his feel, almost like a producer would communi-
cate with a real drummer in a recording session.

Lesson 4

146    Produce a Virtual Drum Track
Creating a Drummer Track
Drummer is a new Logic Pro X feature that allows you to produce drum tracks using 
a virtual drummer with his own playing style. His performance is placed in Drummer 
regions on a Drummer track. You edit the performance data in the regions using the 
Drummer Editor. The virtual drummer also has his own drum kit loaded in a software 
instrument plug-in called Drum Kit Designer.
First, let’s open a new project, add a Drummer track, and examine the display of the drum 
performance in the Drummer region.
1	
Choose File > New (or press Command-Shift-N).
A new project opens along with the New Tracks dialog.
2	
In the New Tracks dialog, select Drummer, and click Create.
A Drummer track is created along with two eight-bar Drummer regions. At the bot-
tom of the main window, the Drummer Editor opens, allowing you to choose a drum-
mer and his drum kit, and to edit the performance in the Drummer region(s) that are 
selected in the workspace. The track is named SoCal, which is the name of the drum 
kit used by the default virtual drummer, Kyle.

3	
Press the Spacebar to listen to the two Drummer regions.
In the first region, the drummer starts with a crash cymbal, and plays a straightfor-
ward rock pattern. At the end of the first four measures, he plays the simplest of fills 
(a single tom hit), followed by a crash cymbal that accentuates the first downbeat of 
bar 5. At the end of the first Drummer region, a drum fill leads into the next section.
In the second region, the drummer switches from the hi-hat to the ride cymbal, and 
plays a more complex pattern: The kick is busier, and the snare adds ghost notes (very 
quiet hits) between beats. As in the first region, the drummer plays a fill at the end of the 
first four measures, followed by a crash. He plays another fill at the end of the region.
Let’s take a closer look at that Drummer region.
4	
Control-Option-drag over the first bar of the first Drummer region. If necessary, con-
tinue zooming vertically by dragging the vertical zoom slider (or pressing Command-
Down Arrow) until you can see two lanes in the Drummer region.
Crash cymbal
Stronger hi-hat
Softer hi-hat

The Drummer region displays drum hits as triangles on lanes, roughly emulating the 
look of drum hits on an audio waveform. Kicks and snares are shown on the bottom 
lane; cymbals, toms, and hand percussions are on the top lane.

Listen to the first bar a few times while looking at the drum hits in the Drummer 
region.
Although you cannot edit individual drum hits in the Drummer region, the region 
display gives you a quick glance at the drummer’s performance.

mer regions.
Now you can read the Drummer regions. In the next exercise, you will listen to multiple 
drummers and several performance presets. Later, you will zoom in again to see the 
Drummer regions update as you adjust their settings in the Drummer Editor.
Choosing a Drummer and a Style
Each drummer has his own playing style and drum kit, and those combine to create a 
unique drum sound. Before you start fine-tuning the drummer’s performance, you need 
to choose the right drummer for the song.
In the Drummer Editor, drummers are categorized by music genres. By default, choosing 
a new drummer means loading a new virtual drum kit, and updating Drummer region

Although you will later fine-tune the drummer’s performance, Jesse’s busy, syncopated 
drum patterns are not a good fit for this indie rock song. You are looking for a drum-
mer with a simple, straightforward style that more appropriately serves the song.

Creating a Drummer Track    153
Editing the Drum Performance
In a recording session with a live drummer, the artist, the producer, or the musical direc-
tor must communicate their vision of the completed song. They may ask the drummer to 
play behind or ahead of the beat to change the feel of the groove, or to switch from the 
hi-hat to the ride cymbal during the chorus, or to play a drum fill in a specific location.
In Logic Pro X, editing a drummer performance is almost like giving instructions to a real 
drummer. In this exercise, you will play a drum region in Cycle mode as you adjust the 
drummer settings.
1	
In the workspace, make sure the first Drummer region is still selected, and in the 
Drummer Editor, click the Play button.
Next to the presets, an XY pad with a yellow puck lets you adjust both the loudness 
and complexity of the drum pattern.
2	
As the region plays, drag the puck, or click different locations inside the pad to 
reposition it.
 To undo your most recent Drummer Editor adjustment, press Command-Z.
After positioning the puck, you must wait for the region to update (update time var-
ies depending on your computer). If you drag the puck constantly, the region will 
not update.
As you position the puck farther to the right, the drum pattern becomes more com-
plex; and as you move the puck toward the top of the pad, the drummer plays louder. 
Try placing the puck in the pad’s corners for extreme settings, such as soft and simple, 
or loud and complex.

154    Produce a Virtual Drum Track
As the drummer plays softer, he closes the hi-hat and switches from hitting the snare 
drum on the skin to playing rim clicks (hitting only the rim of the drum). As he plays 
louder, he opens the hi-hat and start playing rim shots (hitting the skin and the rim 
simultaneously for accent).
Let’s make the drummer play a solid, straightforward beat in this first Drummer 
region, which will be used for the first verse of the song.
3	
Settle for a puck position where the drummer plays a rather simple and fairly loud 
pattern.
You can still hear a lot of syncopation on the kick drums. To the right of the XY pad, 
you can choose from several Kick & Snare pattern variations.
4	
Drag the Kick & Snare slider to position 2 (or click the second increment on the slider).
The drummer now simply alternates kick and snare on every beat. If you don’t hear 
the drummer play the snare on beats 2 and 4, slightly readjust the horizontal position 
of the puck in the XY pad so it’s in the same position as in the figure following step 3.
Listen to the hi-hat: It is currently playing eighth notes.
5	
Click the first increment on the Hi-Hat slider.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating a Drummer Track    155
The hi-hat now plays only on the beat (quarter notes), which works well for up-tempo 
songs.
The drummer is playing a fill in the middle of the region (before bar 5) and another 
at the end (before bar 9). Let’s get rid of the first fill and keep only one at the end.
6	
Look at the region in the workspace while trying different positions for the Fills knob, 
and drag the Fills knob down until you see the fill before bar 5 disappear. You should 
still see a fill at the end of the region.
NOTE ▶ ​Clicking the small lock icon next to the Fills and Swing knobs locks the knob 
into position as you preview presets or drummers.
 Each time you adjust a setting in the Drummer Editor, the selected region is 
refreshed and the drummer plays a new subtle variation. Dragging the Fills knob by 
a tiny amount is a quick way to refresh a region. You can also click the Action pop-
up menu next to the Presets menu, and choose Refresh Region; or Control-click the 
region in the workspace, and from the shortcut menu, choose Edit > Refresh Region.
You now have a very straightforward beat. Because the drummer plays less now, he 
can make the hi-hat ring a bit more.

The Drummer Editor updates to show the second region’s settings. On the drum kit, 
the hi-hat is now dimmed, while the cymbals are highlighted in yellow. The drummer 
no longer plays the hi-hat, but instead plays a ride or crash cymbal in that region.
13	 In the Drummer Editor, click the Play button.
You can hear the second region in Cycle mode. The drummer is playing the ride cym-
bal on every eighth note. For a more powerful chorus, you instead want him to play 
crash cymbals on every beat.
14	 Click the first increment of the Cymbals slider.
You now hear crash cymbals on every beat. Even for a chorus, the beat is a little too busy.

15	 On the XY pad, drag the puck toward the left to create a simpler beat.
Let’s listen to the verse going into the chorus.
16	 Stop playback.
17	 Go to the beginning of the song and listen to both Drummer regions.
You now have a simple, straightforward beat for the verse, and then the drummer 
switches to the crash cymbal for the busier chorus pattern.
You have carefully crafted two eight-measure drum grooves: one for the verse and one 
for the chorus. They are the two most important building blocks of the song that you will 
now start arranging.
Arranging the Drum Track
In this exercise, you will lay out the whole song structure and continue editing drum 
regions for each section, still using the two Drummer regions you edited for the verses 
and choruses.
Using Markers in the Arrangement Track
Using the Arrangement track, you will now create arrangement markers for all the sections 
of your song. You’ll adjust their lengths, positions, and order, and fill all the new sections 
with Drummer regions.

Amazing as his playing is, Kyle (the drummer) might not have guessed what you had in 
mind for each section. You will now edit the new regions to finish adjusting the drum-
mer’s performance.
Editing the Intro Drum Performance
In this exercise, you will make the drummer play the snare instead of the toms. Later, 
you’ll cut the Intro region in two and make the drummer play the snare only during the 
first half. Then you’ll add the kick and hi-hat in the second half.

In the workspace, click the background to deselect all regions, and click the Intro 
region to select it.
The Drummer Editor shows its settings.
Throughout this exercise you can click the Play button in the Drummer Editor to 
start and stop playback, or you can navigate the workspace by pressing the Spacebar 
(Play or Stop) and the Return key (Go to Beginning).

In the first two measures, the drummer will be playing only the snare. Let’s have him 
play the snare very softly on every beat, as if he’s counting in the band.
10	 In the Kick & Snare slider, click the sixth increment.
The snare plays every beat.
 In multi-track projects, when you click the Follow checkbox, a pop-up menu 
appears instead of the Kick & Snare slider that lets you choose a track to influence 
what the drummer plays on the kick and snare.
11	 In the XY pad, drag the puck all the way down and to the left.
Now the drummer plays rim clicks at the beginning of the first Intro region, and hits 
the snare a few times at the end.
12	 In the workspace, select the second Intro region.
13	 In the Kick & Snare slider, click the second increment.

www.ebook3000.com

Arranging the Drum Track    167
Your have a short two-part intro. The drummer plays the snare on the first eight beats, 
and then a basic rock pattern with a very open hi-hat adds energy. At bar 5, a crash 
punctuates the fill at the end of the intro. The straightforward groove continues in the 
Verse section with the hi-hat a little less open to leave space to later add a singer.
Editing the Bridge Drum Performance
In a song, the bridge serves to break the sequence of alternating verses and choruses. 
Often, the main idea of the song is exposed in the choruses, and verses help support or 
develop that statement. The bridge can present an alternate idea, a different point of view. 
Departing from the main idea of the song increases the listener’s appreciation for return-
ing to the chorus at the end of the song—almost like taking a vacation can increase your 
appreciation for going back home.
For this fast, high-energy indie-rock song, a quieter bridge in which the instruments play 
softer will offer a refreshing dynamic contrast. Playing softer does not mean the instru-
ments have to play less, however. In fact, you will make the drums play a busier pattern 
during this bridge.
1	
Listen to the Bridge region.
 When pressing the Spacebar to play a section, you can use Cycle mode to 
ensure that playback always starts at the beginning of the section. Drag a section’s 
arrangement marker into the ruler to turn on Cycle mode and create a cycle area that 
matches the section.
The drummer plays at the same level as in the previous sections, but he plays more 
here. You need to bring down his energy level.
2	
Select the Bridge Drummer region.

168    Produce a Virtual Drum Track
3	
In the XY pad, position the puck all the way down and to the right.
The drummer is still playing a lot, but he’s much quieter. He no longer hits the snare’s 
skin but plays rim clicks instead. However, rim clicks are not the type of sound you’re 
going for; you want Kyle to play toms.
4	
On the drum kit, mute the snare, and unmute the toms.
When you click the toms, the hi-hat is automatically muted. Aside from the kick and 
snare, the drummer can focus on the toms, the hi-hat, or the cymbals (ride and crash).
Let’s choose a busier pattern for the toms.
5	
On the Toms slider, click increment 3.
Kyle is now playing sixteenth notes on the toms, which create a mysterious vibe simi-
lar to tribal percussions. You will make him switch from the toms to the ride cymbal 
in the second half of the bridge to brighten things up.
6	
Command-double-click the Bridge region at bar 41 to cut it into two four bar regions.
www.ebook3000.com

Arranging the Drum Track    169
The drummer now plays a different fill at the end of the first Bridge region.
While the second Bridge region is still selected, you can adjust the cycle area.
7	
Control-click the cycle area, and choose “Set Locators by Regions/Events/Marquee” 
(or press Command-U).
8	
Unmute the cymbals.
The toms are muted, and the drummer now plays the ride cymbal. However, the 
groove still seems to be missing something.
9	
Unmute the snare.
You can hear rim clicks.
10	 In the XY pad, drag the puck up just until Kyle switches from hitting the rim to hit-
ting the head of the snare (about a quarter of the way up).
11	 On the Cymbals slider, click the third increment.

170    Produce a Virtual Drum Track
The drummer hits the ride cymbal differently, giving it more of a bell-like sound. He 
plays a crescendo, thereby building up energy to lead into the next chorus.
Kyle plays slightly ahead of the beat during the bridge. However, the timing nuance is 
subtle, and difficult to hear without any other instruments to compare with Kyle’s tim-
ing. Let’s turn on the metronome and experiment with the feel of his performance.
12	 In the control bar, click the Metronome button (or press K).
You will be editing the feel of both Bridge regions simultaneously.
13	 In the workspace, select both Bridge regions, and press Command-U to set the locators.
At the top of the Drummer Editor, the ruler, Play button, and playhead are hidden 
because multiple regions are selected. You can now adjust the settings of all the selected 
regions at once.
NOTE ▶ ​When adjusting a setting that is set to different values in multiple regions, 
the value offset between the regions stays the same (wherever possible).
14	 In the Drummer Editor, click the Details button to display the three setting knobs.
15	 Try setting different positions of the Feel knob and then listen to the results.
Both regions change their “feel.”
As you experiment with different feels, listen to the way the drums play compared to 
the steady, precise beat of the metronome. Don’t be afraid to drag the Feel knob all 
the way up or down to hear the effect of extreme Feel settings.
▶
▶Dragging the Feel knob toward Push makes the drummer play ahead of the beat. 
He sounds as if he’s rushing, thereby creating a sense of urgency.
▶
▶Dragging the Feel knob toward Pull makes him play behind the beat. He sounds 
as if he’s lazy or late, and the groove is more relaxed.
Settle on a Feel knob position more toward Pull to realize a reasonably relaxed groove.

Arranging the Drum Track    171
16	 Click the Details button to hide the three setting knobs. 
17	 Turn off Cycle mode.
18	 In the control bar, click the Metronome button (or press K) to turn it off.
You have radically changed the drummer’s performance in that region. Kyle now starts the 
bridge with a busy pattern on the toms, and then moves on to a bell sound on the ride. He 
uses restraint, hitting softly and behind the beat, with a slight crescendo toward the end. 
The quiet and laid-back yet complex drum groove brings a welcome pause to an otherwise 
high-energy drum performance, and builds up tension leading into the last two sections.
Editing the Chorus and Outro Sections
You will now finish editing the drummer’s performance by adjusting the settings of the 
last two Chorus and Outro Drummer regions in your workspace.
1	
Select the Chorus region after the bridge and listen to it.
That Chorus region was created when you populated the track with Drummer regions 
earlier in this lesson. It doesn’t have the same settings as the previous two choruses 
and sounds busier, except for Kyle playing the ride cymbal instead of the crash.
2	
On the Cymbals slider, click the first increment.
The drummer now plays the crash, and this last chorus is more consistent with the 
previous two choruses.
3	
Select the Outro region at the end of the track and listen to it.
The drummer plays a loud beat, heavy on the crash, which could work for an outro. You 
will, however, make him play double-time (twice as fast) to end the song in a big way.
4	
On the Kick & Snare slider, click the last increment (8).
Now it sounds like you’ve unleashed Kyle! Playing double-time at that fast tempo 
makes the sixteenth notes on the kick drum sound ridiculously fast.

172    Produce a Virtual Drum Track
5	
On the XY pad, drag the puck toward the left until the drummer stops playing six-
teenth notes on the kick drum.
The performance now sounds more realistic while retaining the driving effect of its 
double-time groove.
Let’s finish the song with a longer drum fill.
6	
Drag the Fills knob all the way up.
The drum fill at the end of the outro is now longer. However, raising the number 
of fills has the undesirable effect of adding a new fill in the middle of the outro. To 
remove that fill, you will cut the Outro region in two.
7	
With the Marquee tool, double-click the Outro region at bar 55.
You now have two two-bar Outro regions.
8	
Select the first Outro region.
9	
Drag the Fills knob all the way down to remove the fill in the middle of the Outro section.
10	 Listen to the last chorus and the outro.
The outro has the required power to drive the last four measures; however, it seems 
like the drummer stops abruptly before he can finish his fill. Usually drummers end a 
song by playing the last note on the first beat of a new bar, but here a crash cymbal is 
missing on the downbeat at bar 57. You will resize the last Outro region in the work-
space to accommodate that last drum hit.
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing the Drum Kit    173
11	 Resize the last Outro region to lengthen it by one beat (until the help tag reads 
Length: 2 1 0 0     +0 1 0 0).
A moment after you release the mouse button, the Drummer region updates, and you 
can see a kick and a crash on the downbeat at bar 57.
12	 Listen to the outro. The drummer finishes his fill, punctuating it with the last hit at bar 57.
NOTE ▶ ​The final crash cymbal continues ringing until its natural sustain fades out, 
well after the playhead has passed the end of the last Outro region.
You’ve laid out the entire song structure by creating section markers in the arrangement 
track, populated each section with Drummer regions, and edited each region’s settings 
to customize its drum pattern. You are now done editing the drum performance and can 
focus on the sound of the drums.
Customizing the Drum Kit
When recording a live drummer in a studio, the engineer often positions microphones 
on each drum. This allows control over the sound of each drum, so he can individually 
equalize or compress the sound of each kit piece. The producer may also want the drum-
mer to try different kicks or snares, or to experiment with hitting the cymbals softer 
before he begins recording.
In Logic, when using Drummer, the sounds of each drum are already recorded. However, 
you can still use several tools to customize the drum kit and adjust the sound of each drum.

174    Produce a Virtual Drum Track
Adjusting the Drum Levels Using Smart Controls
Smart Controls are a set of knobs and switches that are premapped to the most important 
parameters of the plug-ins on the channel strip of the selected track. You will study Smart 
Controls in more detail in Lesson 5.
In this exercise, you will use Smart Controls to quickly adjust the levels and tones of dif-
ferent drums. Then you’ll open Drum Kit Designer to swap one snare for another, and 
fine-tune the crash cymbal sound.

In the control bar, click the Smart Controls button (or press B).
The Smart Controls pane opens at the bottom of the main window, replacing the 
Drummer Editor. It is divided into three sections: Mix, Compression, and Effects.
In the Mix section, six knobs allow you to balance the levels of the drum. To the right 
of each knob, a button lets you mute the corresponding drum or group of drums.

In Drum Kit Designer, click the kick drum.
The info pop-up window updates to show you information on the selected kick drum.
Listen to the kick drum. This kick is the right choice for your song, but it has a long 
resonance. Typically, the faster the tempo of the song, the less resonance you want on 
the kick; otherwise low frequencies build up and could become a problem during the 
mix. You may have seen drummers stuff an old blanket in their kick drum to dampen 
them. In Drum Kit Designer, you only have to raise the dampening level.

180    Produce a Virtual Drum Track
10	 In the right pane, drag the Dampen knob up to about 75%, and click the kick to listen 
to it.
The kick’s resonance is shortened.
You will now tune the toms, which are mainly used in the bridge section.
11	 In the workspace, select the first Bridge region.
12	 In the Drummer Editor, click the Play button and mute the kick.
You can hear only the low and mid toms.
13	 In Drum Kit Designer, click one of the toms.
The Edit panel opens with four tabs: All (for adjusting settings of all three toms in the 
kit together); and Low, Mid, and High (for adjusting settings of each individual tom).
14	 Click the Mid tab and raise the Tune knob to around +156 cent.
You can hear the mid tom being pitched up as Kyle continues repeating the first half 
of the bridge.
If you want, feel free to continue exploring Drum Kit Designer and adjusting the 
sound of the hi-hat, ride, and crash cymbals.
15	 Stop playback and close the Drum Kit Designer window.
You have exchanged the snare for another one that sounds a little clearer, dampened the 
kick drum to tame its resonance, and tuned the mid tom to pitch it a bit higher. You have 
now fully customized both the drum performance and the drum kit.

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was created in 1983 to 
standardize the way electronic musical instruments communicate. 
Today, MIDI is extensively used throughout the music industry to 
record and program synthesizers and samplers. Many TV and film 
composers use MIDI to sequence large software sound libraries getting 
ever closer to realizing the sound of a real orchestra.
MIDI sequences can be compared to piano rolls, the perforated paper rolls 
once used by mechanical player pianos. Like the punched holes in piano 
rolls, MIDI events do not contain audio. They contain note information 
such as pitch and velocity. To turn MIDI data into sound, MIDI events are 
routed to a software instrument or to an external MIDI instrument.
There are two basic types of MIDI events: MIDI note events that trigger 
musical notes, and MIDI continuous controller (MIDI CC) events that 
control parameters such as volume, pan, or pitch bend.
For example, when you press C3 on a MIDI controller keyboard, the key-
board sends a note on MIDI event. The note on event contains the pitch 
of the note (C3) and the velocity of the note (which indicates how fast the 
key was struck, thereby showing how hard the musician pressed the key).
Recording MIDI and 
Using Controllers
Lesson 5

186    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
By connecting a MIDI controller keyboard to Logic, you can use Logic to route the MIDI 
events to a virtual software instrument or to an external MIDI instrument. The instru-
ment reacts to the note on event by producing a C3 note, and the velocity typically deter-
mines how loud the note sounds.
When a MIDI controller keyboard is connected to your computer, and its driver is prop-
erly installed (some devices are class-compliant and don’t require a driver installation), 
you can use that keyboard to record MIDI in Logic. Logic automatically routes all incom-
ing MIDI events to the record-enabled software instrument or external MIDI track.
MORE ​INFO ▶  ​To learn more about the MIDI specification, visit the MIDI 
Manufacturers Association website at www.midi.org.
 If you don’t have a MIDI controller keyboard, choose Window > Show 
Musical Typing (or press Command-K) to turn your Mac keyboard into a polyphonic 
MIDI controller. Pressing the Z and X keys allows you to choose the octave range, 
while pressing C and V lets you adjust the note velocities. Keep in mind that you may 
need to close the Musical Typing window (or press Command-K) to access some of 
the Logic key commands.
Using a Patch from the Library
When working with software instruments in Logic, the MIDI events can be recorded, cre-
ated, and edited inside MIDI regions placed on the track. The MIDI events generated by 
playing your MIDI keyboard are routed to the record-enabled track in the Tracks area. 
From the track, those real-time events from your keyboard, or the events played back 
from MIDI regions on the tracks, are routed to the top of the channel strip. They can be 
preprocessed by MIDI effect plug-ins before the MIDI data is passed to the instrument

plug-in. The instrument produces an audio signal that can be further processed using 
audio effect plug-ins. The audio can then be adjusted with the Volume fader and Pan 
knob before being routed to the output destination.

The Setting button at the top of a channel strip allows you to load or save channel  
strip settings, which contain all the plug-ins inserted on a channel strip and their  
individual settings.
The Library lets you load or save patches, channel strip settings, or plug-in settings. A 
patch can be a single channel strip setting, or multiple channel strips and their channel 
strip settings.
 To see a plug-in’s settings in the Library, click to the left of the plug-in on the 
channel strip in the Inspector. A blue triangle and a white frame indicate which plug-
in’s settings the Library is currently displaying.
In this exercise, you will create a software instrument track, choose a patch from the 
Library, and examine the channel strips created in the Mixer.

The Mixer opens and shows three channel strips that are, from left to right:
▶
▶The software instrument channel strip you just created
▶
▶The Output channel strip
▶
▶The Master channel strip
You will now load a patch for the selected software instrument track while watching 
what happens in the Mixer.
4	
In the control bar, click the Library button (or press Y).
The Library opens to the left of the inspector.

In the Library, choose Piano > Steinway Grand Piano.
 In the Library, you can press the Up or Down Arrow keys to select categories 
or patches in a list, and press the Left and Right Arrow keys to navigate to the left or 
right columns.
6	
Play a few keys on your MIDI keyboard to hear the piano sound.
7	
In the Mixer, look at the channel strips.

190    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
On the software instrument channel strip (Steinway Grand Piano), a channel strip set-
ting is loaded, containing an EXS24 (the Logic sampler) instrument plug-in, and three 
audio effect plug-ins: a Channel EQ, a Compressor, and a Tape Delay.
Two new auxiliary channel strips are also created (Small Hall/1.3s Diffuse Hall, and 
Large Hall/6.6s Botta Church), each one with its own channel strip setting. The soft-
ware instrument channel strip has two bus sends that route the audio signal to the 
inputs of the two auxiliaries, set to bus 1 (B 1) and bus 2 (B 2). Together, the software 
instrument channel strip setting, along with the two auxiliaries and their channel strip 
settings, make up the Steinway Grand Piano patch.
In a mixer, a bus transports the audio signal from one channel strip to another. Here, 
Bus 1 and Bus 2 route the stereo audio signal of the piano to two different reverbera-
tion effects on the two auxiliaries.
NOTE ▶ ​In Logic, a single bus can transport a mono, stereo, or surround audio signal.
8	
On the Steinway Piano channel strip, next to the Bus 1 send, drag the bus Send Level 
knob all the way up.
Play the piano with your MIDI keyboard. You can hear the reverberation sound of a 
smaller room.
9	
Next to the Bus 1 send, lower the Send Level knob all the way down.
The piano now has a small amount of reverb that comes from the Bus 2 send.
10	 Next to the Bus 2 send, lower the send level all the way down.
The piano now sounds completely dry with no reverberation.
11	 Next to the Bus 2 send, raise the send level all the way up.
You can hear the reverb of the second auxiliary, which sounds like a much bigger 
room. Notice how this reverb sustains for a longer time than the first one.

Recording MIDI    191
12	 Continue adjusting the bus send levels to compare the sound of the two reverbs, and 
then set them to a level that sounds good to you.
 To load a patch without its bus sends and auxiliary channel strips, start with 
an empty software instrument channel strip. At the lower left of the Library, from the 
Action menu, choose Enable Patch Merging. Then deselect the Sends button.
13	 Close the Mixer.
Now that you know how to choose a patch from the library, and how to adjust the amount of 
reverb using the bus Send Level knobs, you will explore several MIDI recording techniques. 
You will save your own custom patches later in this lesson.
Recording MIDI
In Logic, the basic techniques used to record MIDI are similar to the techniques you used 
to record audio in Lesson 2. You will now observe the MIDI In display in the control bar 
as you send MIDI events to Logic, and record a simple piano part.
1	
Play a few notes on your MIDI keyboard while observing the LCD display.
MIDI input activity
A small dot appears at the upper right of the LCD display to indicate that Logic is 
receiving MIDI events.
NOTE ▶ ​When Logic sends MIDI events to external MIDI devices, a small dot 
appears at the lower right of the LCD display.
These small dots can be useful to quickly troubleshoot MIDI connections. Logic can, 
however, provide a more detailed view of the incoming MIDI events.
2	
Click the note and metronome icons to the left of the LCD display, and choose Custom.
MIDI input activity

192    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
The Custom LCD display appears. It includes a MIDI input activity monitor that 
shows incoming MIDI events in more detail.
3	
Hold down a key on your MIDI keyboard.
A note icon indicates that the event received is a MIDI note on event. You can also see 
the MIDI channel number of the MIDI event, the note’s pitch, and its velocity. In the 
previous image, the event’s MIDI channel is 1, its pitch is D#3, and its velocity is 108.
NOTE ▶ ​MIDI events can be sent on up to 16 different MIDI channels, which allows 
you to control different timbres on different channels when using multi-timbral 
instruments.
4	
Release the key on your MIDI keyboard.
Depending on your controller, in the LCD display, you may see a note on event with 
a velocity of zero, or you may see a note with a strike through it, which represents a 
note off event. 
NOTE ▶ ​Pressing and releasing a key on a MIDI keyboard sends two events: a note on 
and a note off event. However, most MIDI editors represent the two events as a single 
note event with a length attribute.
5	
Play a chord on your MIDI keyboard.
The MIDI input activity monitor displays the chord name.
You could start recording a piano part now, but first you’ll open the Piano Roll so you 
can watch the MIDI notes appear on the grid as they are recorded.
6	
In the control bar, click the Editors button, and at the top of the Editors pane, ensure 
that Piano Roll is selected (or press P).
The Piano Roll opens at the bottom of the main window.
7	
Make sure the playhead is at the beginning of the project, and click the Record button 
(or press R).
www.ebook3000.com

Recording MIDI    193
The LCD display and the playhead turn red to indicate that Logic is recording. The 
playhead jumps back one bar, giving you a four-beat count-in, and you can hear the 
metronome.
8	
When the playhead appears, play quarter notes for a couple of bars to record a very 
simple bass line.
When you play the first note, a red MIDI region named Steinway Grand Piano 
appears on the record-enabled track. The region’s length constantly updates to include 
the most recent MIDI event received.
The MIDI notes appear in the Piano Roll and on the region in the workspace as you 
record them.
NOTE ▶ ​If the pitch of the notes you record is outside the range of pitches displayed 
in the Piano Roll, you will not see the notes as they are recorded.
9	
Stop recording.
The region is now shaded green. You can see the recorded notes in the Piano Roll.
 To see all the notes in the Piano Roll, make sure that all the notes are dese-
lected, and press Z.

194    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
10	 In the Piano Roll, click the Play button at the top left of the region.
The region starts playback in Cycle mode. If you are not happy with your perfor-
mance, you can undo it (Command-Z) and try again.
If you are mostly happy, but one or two notes need correction, you can quickly fix 
them in the Piano Roll:
▶
▶Drag a note vertically to change its pitch.
▶
▶Drag a note horizontally to change its timing.
▶
▶Click a note, and press Delete to remove it.
You will learn how to edit MIDI events in more detail in Lesson 6.
11	 Click the region’s Play button again (or press the Spacebar) to stop playback.
Correcting the Timing of a MIDI Recording
If you are not happy with the timing of your MIDI performance, you can correct the tim-
ing of the notes using a time-correction method called quantization. To quantize a MIDI 
region, you choose a note value from the Quantize menu in the Region inspector, and 
inside the region, the notes snap to the nearest absolute value.
Quantizing MIDI Regions
In this exercise, you will quantize the piano passage you recorded in the previous exercise, 
so that the notes are in sync with the metronome.
NOTE ▶ ​If you were quite happy with the timing of your performance, you may want 
to undo your previous recording and record again with a less accurate timing so that 
you can more clearly hear the benefits of quantization.
www.ebook3000.com

Correcting the Timing of a MIDI Recording    195
1	
In the workspace, make sure the piano region is still selected.
2	
In the Region inspector, click the Quantize value (currently set to off) and choose 1/4 
Note while looking at the notes in the Piano Roll.
All the MIDI notes in the piano region snap to the nearest quarter note.
3	
In the control bar, click the Metronome button (or press K) to turn it on.
4	
Play the piano region. The notes are now perfectly in sync with the metronome.
In Logic, quantizing is a nondestructive operation. You can always revert the notes to 
their original position.
5	
In the Region inspector, set Quantize to off.
In the Piano Roll, the notes return to their original recording positions.
6	
In the Region inspector, set Quantize back to 1/4 Note.
The notes are once more in sync with the metronome.
7	
Turn off the metronome, and stop playback.
Choosing Default Quantization Settings
You can choose a default quantization setting, so that any new recording will automati-
cally be quantized to that value. This is very useful when you are not completely confident 
of your timing chops. Because the Quantize setting is nondestructive, you can always 
adjust it or turn it off for that region after you’re finished recording.
1	
In the workspace, click the background.
All regions are deselected, and the Region inspector now displays the MIDI Thru 
parameters. The MIDI Thru settings will be automatically applied to any new MIDI 
region you record.

196    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
2	
In the MIDI Thru parameters, set Quantize to 1/8 Note.
3	
In the workspace, click the piano region, and press Delete to delete the region.
4	
Move the playhead to the beginning of the project, and click the Record button (or 
press R).
Record another simple bass line as you did in the previous exercise. Feel free to play 
eighth notes this time since that’s the Quantize value you selected.
5	
Stop recording.
In the Piano Roll, the notes immediately snap to the nearest eighth note on the grid. 
In the Region inspector, the Quantize parameter for the new piano region is set to 1/8 
Note. Remember that the Quantize setting is nondestructive, which means that you 
can still turn it off.
6	
In the Region inspector, set Quantize to off. In the Piano Roll, the notes move to their 
original recorded positions.
7	
Set Quantize back to 1/8 Note.

Joining Recordings into a MIDI Region    197
Joining Recordings into a MIDI Region
Sometimes you may want to record a MIDI performance in several passes. For example, 
when recording piano, you want to record just the left hand, and then record the right 
hand in a second pass. Or you could record drums in multiple passes, recording the kick 
drum first, then the snare drum, then the hi-hat, then the crash cymbal, building up a 
drum beat by focusing on a single piece of the drum kit at a time.
In Logic, when recording MIDI events on top of an existing MIDI region, you can choose 
to join the new recording with the existing MIDI region.
Recording into a Selected MIDI Region
In the previous exercise, you recorded a simple bass line onto a piano track. Now you will 
record chords as you listen to your bass line, merging the new chords with that bass line 
inside the same MIDI region. First, you will choose the correct recording setting to merge 
your new recording with the selected region.
1	
Choose File > Project Settings > Recording.
2	
Under MIDI, set Overlapping Recordings to “Join with Selected Regions.”
Now you just have to select the existing MIDI region before recording, and the new 
recording will be joined with the existing region when you stop recording.
3	
Close the Project Settings window.
4	
Make sure the piano region you recorded in the previous exercise is still selected.
5	
Move the playhead to the beginning and start recording.
This time, play only a couple of chords that complement the bass line you previously 
recorded.

198    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
The new notes you’re playing appear next to the existing ones in the Piano Roll.
6	
Stop recording.
The new notes immediately snap to the nearest eighth note on the grid.  On the track, 
the Steinway Grand Piano MIDI region contains all the notes recorded in this exercise 
and the previous one.
 You can also use this technique to add MIDI controller events such as pitch 
bend or modulation to a region after you have recorded the MIDI notes.
www.ebook3000.com

Joining Recordings into a MIDI Region    199
Joining Recordings in Cycle Mode
Recording MIDI in Cycle mode allows you to continuously repeat the same section and 
record new events only when you are ready. This can be very useful when recording a drum 
pattern. You can loop over a section, building up the drum groove by adding new elements 
during each pass of the cycle while listening to the drums you have already recorded.
When recording MIDI in Cycle mode, notes recorded in all consecutive passes of the 
cycle are joined into a single MIDI region. In this exercise, you will record drums in Cycle 
mode, first recording the kick, then the snare, and finally the hi-hat.
First, let’s close the current project and create a new one.
1	
Choose File > Close Project (or press Command-Option-W), and when prompted, 
close but don’t save the existing project.
 When only one window is open in Logic, you can close the project by choos-
ing File > Close (or pressing Command-W).
2	
Choose File > New. In the New Tracks dialog, select Software Instrument and click Create.
In a new project, “Join when Cycling” is selected by default in the Overlapping 
Recordings pop-up menu (File > Project Settings > Recording). Recording in Cycle 
mode will place all recorded notes in the same region, which is the desired behavior 
for this exercise.
3	
In the control bar, click the Library button (or press Y).
4	
In the Library, select Drum Kit > Brooklyn.
The Brooklyn patch is loaded, including a channel strip setting that is loaded for 
the software instrument channel strip in the inspector. It comprises the Drum Kit 
Designer instrument plug-in, and the Channel EQ, Compressor, and Multipressor 
audio effect plug-ins. The channel strip sends to bus 1, and if you open the Mixer, you 
can see a new auxiliary—and its plug-ins—with its input set to bus 1.
Let’s customize the LCD display so that you can see the detailed MIDI input activity 
monitor.

200    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
5	
To the left of the LCD display, click the note and metronome icons, and choose Custom.
Before you start recording, you need to locate the keys that trigger the kick, snare, and 
hi-hat on your MIDI controller. You will use:
▶
▶C1: kick
▶
▶D1: snare
▶
▶F#1: closed hi-hat
▶
▶A#1: open hi-hat
6	
Play the lowest C key on your MIDI keyboard while watching the MIDI activity in the 
LCD display.
If the display doesn’t show a C1, you can use the Octave –/+ buttons on your key-
board to offset the pitch range. Once you’ve found C1, locate D1 (the next white key 
to the right), F#1, and A#1 (respectively the first and the last keys of the next group of 
three black keys to the right).
7	
In the upper half of the ruler, click the cycle area to turn on Cycle mode.
Since you don’t have a region in the workspace, the Region inspector displays the 
MIDI Thru settings.
8	
In the Region inspector, set Quantize to 1/16 Note. 
You will now record the drums one at a time. Let’s open the Piano Roll to see the 
notes appear on the grid as you record them.
9	
In the control bar, click the Editors button (or press P) to open the Piano Roll.
10	 Start recording. You hear a four-beat count-in before the playhead reaches the begin-
ning of the cycle area.
11	 Play C1 notes on the first and third beat of every bar.
When the playhead reaches the end of the cycle, it jumps back and starts a new pass. You 
can hear the kick drum notes you just recorded. Notice that the notes snap to the nearest 
sixteenth note because you chose that value as your MIDI Thru Quantize setting.
www.ebook3000.com

Joining Recordings into a MIDI Region    201
You have all the time in the world before you continue to record. As long as you don’t 
play anything, Logic continues cycling over the existing region, playing back your kick 
drums. And if you forgot to play one or two kick drum notes, you can record them 
during one of the subsequent cycle passes.
12	 Play D1 notes on the second and fourth beat of every bar. The kick and the snare 
should alternate on every beat.
13	 Play hi-hats on every eighth note using the F#1 (close hi-hat) and A#1 (open hi-hat) 
keys, playing the open hi-hat only as the last eighth note of some of the bars.
14	 Stop recording, and click the background of the Piano Roll to deselect the notes.

202    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
You can see your drum pattern. Now that the notes are not selected, you can see their 
colors, which vary depending on the note’s velocity.
Joining MIDI recordings as you did in the two previous exercises provides a lot of flex-
ibility and allows you to take your time, recording a single part of a performance at a time. 
These techniques will help in many situations. For example, consider first recording the 
notes of a cello melody, then later recording the movements of the pitch bend wheel to 
add cello-like vibrato toward the end of sustained notes.
Recording MIDI Takes
When you want to nail a performance or experiment with several musical ideas, you can 
record multiple takes and later choose the best one. The techniques for recording MIDI 
takes are similar to the techniques you used to record audio takes in Lesson 2. You can 
record new takes over an existing region or take folder, or you can record multiple takes in 
Cycle mode.
Cycle mode should still be turned on from the previous exercise. Let’s record takes in Cycle 
mode and experiment with using different melodies for a bass line.
1	
Choose File > Project Settings > Recording.
2	
Under MIDI, from Overlapping Recordings, choose Create Take Folders.
3	
Close the Project Settings window.
4	
Choose Track > New Software Instrument Track (or press Command-Option-S).
5	
Open the Library, and choose Bass > Stinger Bass.
6	
Start playback and play a few notes on your MIDI keyboard.
You can hear your bass, and you can practice until you find an idea for a simple bass 
line that will work with the drums you recorded on track 1.
www.ebook3000.com

Recording MIDI Takes    203
▶	About Live Mode
Selecting a software instrument track automatically record-enables it, but the instru-
ment is not always in Live mode (for example when selecting a software instrument 
track during playback). An instrument in Live mode requires more CPU resources. 
When an instrument is not in Live mode, the first note you play will take about 100 
ms (milliseconds) to trigger the instrument, which is then placed in Live mode.
You can put an instrument in Live mode by sending any MIDI event to it (playing a 
dummy note, moving the modulation wheel, and so on), by clicking the R button in 
the track header to make it solid red, or by starting playback.
Record-enabled instrument not in Live mode

7	
While playback continues, click the Record button (or press R). Logic continues 
repeating the cycle area, so you don’t lose your groove.
8	
When the playhead starts a new pass of the cycle, play a bass melody on the MIDI 
keyboard.
When you’re done recording the four-bar bass melody, the playhead jumps back to 
the beginning of the cycle and you cannot hear the take you just recorded (if you can 
hear the take you just recorded, stop recording, then start recording again). You can 
continue recording new takes while staying in Cycle mode, or stop recording and start 
recording again to record new takes.
9	
Record two more takes of the bass.
10	 Start playback. You can hear the last take of the bass.
11	 In the workspace, from the take folder pop-up menu, choose take 2.

204    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
You can hear take 2.
NOTE ▶ ​Note that there’s no Quick Swipe Comping button next to the take folder 
pop-up menu. Unlike audio take folders, you cannot comp sections of takes in a 
MIDI take folder. 
12	 Double-click the take folder to open it and click the first take, at the bottom of the list, 
to play it.
13	 Choose your favorite take, and from the take folder pop-up menu, choose Flatten.
The take folder is flattened and only the selected bass take remains in a MIDI region. 
You will punch in on that bass MIDI region in the next exercise.
14	 Stop playback.
 If you want to keep a performance you played while Logic was in playback 
mode, click Stop and press Shift-R (Capture as Recording). A MIDI region containing 
your last performance is created on the track.

Punching In and Out    205
Punching In and Out
You can use the punch on the fly and autopunch techniques you learned for audio recording 
to punch on MIDI recordings. The only difference is that you’ll have to enable Replace mode.
In the next exercise, you will use the Replace and Autopunch modes to re-record a section 
of the bass line you recorded in the previous exercise.
1	
Command-click the lower half of the ruler (or press Command-Control-Option-P) to 
turn on Autopunch mode.
The autopunch area appears in the middle of the ruler.
2	
Drag the edges of the autopunch area and adjust it so that it encompasses the section 
you want to replace.
When recording MIDI in Autopunch mode, Logic records only within the autopunch 
area. However it does not delete existing notes in that area unless you have enabled 
Replace mode.
3	
In the control bar, click the Replace button.
Replace mode is turned on, and the existing notes within the autopunch section will 
be deleted when you record.

206    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
4	
Choose File > Project Settings > Recording.
You will try to punch in with two different recording settings to observe their differ-
ent behaviors.
5	
Under MIDI, set Overlapping Recordings to “Join when Cycling” (the default setting), 
and close the Project Settings window.
6	
Go to the beginning and start recording.
The playhead jumps ahead one bar so you can hear the count-in, and the section of 
the bass region in the autopunch area is deleted.
You can start playing the bass line from the beginning, but only the notes within the 
autopunch area will be recorded. This gives you a chance to get into the groove before 
re-recording the notes that need to be replaced.
NOTE ▶ ​To successfully punch in and out of MIDI regions, make sure you hit the 
first note after the punch-in point or it will not be recorded. And make sure you 
release the last note before the punch-out point or the MIDI note off event will not be 
recorded, and the last note will sustain until the end of the new region.
When you play notes within the autopunch area, a new region is created that starts at 
the beginning of the bar. You now have three MIDI regions on the track, and some of 
them may overlap. Let’s join the three regions into a single region to clean this up.
www.ebook3000.com

Punching In and Out    207
7	
In the workspace, drag a rectangle around the three bass regions to select them.
8	
Choose Edit > Join > Regions (or press Command-J).
Using the region joining techniques you learned at the beginning of this lesson, you 
will now “punch and join” in one operation.
9	
Choose File > Project Settings > Recording. Set Overlapping Recordings to “Join with 
Selected Regions,” and close the Project Settings window.
10	 Start recording.
This time the region stays intact. Inside the bass region, the notes within the autopunch 
area are deleted. Play the bass line so that new notes are recorded in the autopunch area.
11	 Stop recording.
The notes you recorded in the autopunch area are merged with the region.

208    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
12	 Command-click the lower half of the ruler (or press Command-Control-Option-P) to 
turn off Autopunch mode.
13	 In the control bar, click the Replace button to turn off Replace mode.
Creating a Layered Sound Patch
Well before recording was invented, composers used sound layering to thicken sounds. In 
a classical orchestra, you often hear multiple musicians playing the same part at the same 
time. When all the violins play a melody together, you hear a rich warm tone and the 
emotional level is raised.
Sound layering is a common technique used by music producers to make just about 
any instrument sound thicker, or to mix the timbres of different sounds. For example, 
many vocals on commercial songs are doubled (the singer records two identical perfor-
mances that are played simultaneously), and dance music producers often layer multiple 
kick drum samples, such as combining a kick drum with a strong percussive attack and 
another that has a boomy sustain.
In Logic, Track Stacks allow you to combine a group of tracks and control them as a single 
track. Track Stacks can be used to organize tracks you want to group together (such as drum 
tracks or backup vocal tracks). They can also be used to group software instrument tracks, 
so that the MIDI notes on a single track can trigger all the instruments in the Track Stack.
In this exercise, you will create a Track Stack for two different synthesizer patches, and 
save the Track Stack as a new patch.
1	
Choose File > New (or press Command-Shift-N), and when prompted, close but don’t 
save the existing project.
2	
In the New Tracks dialog, select Software Instrument, and set “Number of tracks” to 2.

Creating a Layered Sound Patch    209
Two empty software instrument tracks are created.
3	
Click the Library button (or press Y) to open the Library.
4	
In the Tracks area, select the first track, and in the Library, choose Synthesizer >  
Lead > Nightlife Lead.
5	
Play your MIDI keyboard.
The synth sounds modern; it is quite edgy and buzzy. Try playing a bass line in the 
C1–C2 range. This modern bass has a lot of character, but it lacks the body and thick-
ness of an older analog synth.
6	
In the Tracks area, select track 2, and in the Library, choose Synthesizer > Lead > 70s 
Analog Lead.
That synth is more rounded and warm. Plus, it has more low frequencies, which will bring 
body to the layered sound. Let’s select both tracks and create a Track Stack for them.
 To hear both sounds layered before you create the Track Stack, record-enable 
both track headers and play your MIDI keyboard.
7	
Shift-click the unselected track header to select both track headers.
8	
Choose Track > Create Track Stack (or press Command-Shift-D).
A dialog lets you choose between a folder stack or a summing stack. To group soft-
ware instruments and work with the MIDI data on the main track of a Track Stack, 
you need to use a summing stack.

210    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
9	
Select Summing Stack, and click Create.
In the Tracks area, the main track of the new summing stack appears at the top, while 
the two original software instrument tracks become subtracks of the Track Stack.
Main track
Subtracks
10	 Make sure the main track of the Track Stack is record-enabled, and play your MIDI 
keyboard.
You can now hear the layered sound combining both the Nightlife Lead and the 70s 
Analog Lead patches.
11	 Click a track header to keep only one track selected, and try muting either subtrack 
inside the Track Stack.
Muting a subtrack allows you to determine exactly what that subtrack adds to the lay-
ered sound. When you mute Nightlife Lead, the sound loses its edge and buzzy quality. 
When you mute 70s Analog Lead, the sound loses body and warmth.
12	 Unmute both subtracks.
Let’s give the main track an icon that will be saved along with the patch.
13	 On the main track, Control-click the icon, and choose a keyboard icon.
14	 In the Library, click Save.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating a Layered Sound Patch    211
15	 In the Save dialog, type a filename for the patch, and save it to the default location.
In the Library, a new User Patches category is created in the left column and your new 
patch is selected inside it.
In the workspace, the main track in the Track Stack is renamed after the patch you 
saved. The main track and the subtracks have a green background to indicate that 
they all belong to a summing stack.

212    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
16	 On the Track Stack’s main track header, click the disclosure triangle next to the icon.
The Track Stack is now closed and appears as a single track. It retains all functionality, 
and as long as the Track Stack is record-enabled, you can continue playing or record-
ing the layered patch from your MIDI keyboard.
Now that you saved your own custom patch in the library, it will be available in any 
project you open in Logic when a track of the same type (a software instrument track) 
is selected. Choosing the Thick Layered Synth patch from the Library will replace the 
selected software instrument track by the Summing stack and its two subtracks.
Creating a Split Keyboard Patch
In this exercise, you will combine two existing patches into a new patch, but specify a 
range of notes on the keyboard for each of the two patches. This allows you to effectively 
split your MIDI keyboard into two or more note ranges, each with a different sound.
You will create a patch that plays a bass sound below the C3 key, and a piano sound above 
it. First, you can delete the Track Stack you created in the previous exercise as you will no 
longer need it.
1	
Drag the Thick Layered Synth track header toward the left, outside the Tracks area.
When the Pointer tool goes outside the Tracks area, it turns into an Eraser tool, and 
when you release the mouse button the Track Stack is deleted in a puff of smoke. 
Because your Tracks area no longer has any tracks, the New Tracks dialog opens.
2	
In the New Tracks dialog, make sure Software Instrument is selected, set “Number of 
tracks” to 2 and click create.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating a Split Keyboard Patch    213
Two empty software instrument tracks are created.
3	
Select the first track, and in the Library, choose Bass > Upright Studio Bass.
4	
Play your MIDI keyboard to hear the sound of an upright bass.
5	
Select the second track, and in the Library, choose Vintage Electric Piano > Bright Mk 
II Blackface.
6	
Play your MIDI keyboard to hear the sound of an electric piano with a rhythmic 
automatic panning effect.
7	
In the Tracks area, Shift-click the unselected track to select both tracks.
8	
Choose Track > Create Track Stack (or press Command-Shift-D), and create a summing 
stack.
9	
Play your MIDI keyboard.
You now hear the upright bass and the electric piano sounds layered, as in the previ-
ous exercise. You will now limit the pitch ranges each instrument will respond to.
10	 Select the Upright Studio Bass subtrack.
11	 Below the Region inspector, click the disclosure triangle to open the Track inspector.
The Track inspector displays the track parameters. The Key Limit parameter values, 
C-2 and G8, define the key range that this track responds to. Let’s limit its key range 
to notes below C3 so that the new range spans C-2 to B2.

214    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
12	 Drag G8 down until its value is B2.
13	 Try playing notes over the entire range of the keyboard.
The lower keys up to B2 play the upright bass sound, while the higher keys from C3 
don’t play any sound.
14	 In the Tracks area, select the Bright Mk II Blackface subtrack.
15	 In the Track inspector, drag the lower key limit (C-2) up to C3.
16	 In the Tracks area, click the main track of the Track Stack, and play your MIDI keyboard.
All the keys below C3 play the upright bass whereas the keys from C3 and up play the 
electric piano. Try playing a bass melody with your left hand while sustaining some 
chords with your right hand.
17	 In the Library, click Save, name the patch Split Bass and E-Piano, and save it.

Mapping Smart Controls to Patch Parameters    215
Mapping Smart Controls to Patch Parameters
In Lesson 4, you used Smart Controls. You were able to use the Smart Controls as a one-
stop shop for adjusting multiple parameters such as a bus send level, parameters of the 
instrument plug-in, and parameters of the channel EQ plug-in.
This time you will use Smart Controls to adjust parameters of the individual software instru-
ment channel strips on the subtracks of the layered synth patch you previously created in 
this lesson. You will map the screen controls to plug-in parameters, and assign them knobs 
on your MIDI controller. Finally, you’ll save your Smart Control layout within the patch.
Opening the Plug-Ins for Mapping
In this exercise, you will access the subtracks within the Thick Layered Sound Track Stack 
to open some of their plug-ins. You will later map one parameter of each plug-in to a 
screen control in the Smart Controls pane.
1	
Ensure that the main track of the Track Stack is still selected, and in the Library, 
choose User Patches > Thick Layered Synth.
You will first open the plug-in windows that have parameters you want to map to 
screen controls.
2	
In the Tracks area, select the Nightlife Lead subtrack. The Nightlife Lead channel strip 
is visible at the bottom left of the inspector.
3	
In the inspector, click in the middle of the ES2 instrument plug-in slot to open the 
plug-in.
The ES2 plug-in window opens.
 If the presence of plug-in windows hinders your ability to interact with the 
main window, press V to toggle all plug-in windows on and off.
4	
In the Tracks area, click the 70s Analog Lead subtrack.

216    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
5	
In the inspector, click in the middle of the Tape Delay plug-in slot to open the Tape 
Delay plug-in window.

This time the halo around the knob is red because you’re in Learn mode.
10	 In the Tape Delay plug-in to the left, click the Feedback slider.
In the Parameter Mapping area, make sure the selected screen control is mapped to 
70s Analog Lead > Tape Delay > Feedback.
11	 In the Smart Controls pane, select the third screen control (Knee) and in the Ring-
shifter plug-in, click the round Frequency knob.
In the Parameter Mapping area, make sure the selected screen control is mapped to 
Thick Layered Synth > Ringshifter > Frequency.
12	 Try turning the first three screen controls. In the plug-in windows, the three param-
eters you mapped to the screen controls move accordingly.
13	 Close all three plug-in windows (or press V to hide them).
You don’t need the three remaining screen controls so you will delete their mappings now.
14	 In the Smart Controls pane, click the fourth screen control. In the Mapping area, click 
the mapping, and from the Parameter Mapping pop-up menu, choose Delete Mapping.
The button is disabled and labeled UNMAPPED. Repeat this last step for the fifth and

Assign MIDI Controller Knobs to Screen Controls
Most recent MIDI keyboards and MIDI control surfaces have knobs or faders that send 
MIDI Continuous Controller data, so let’s assign hardware knobs to screen controls in the 
Smart Controls pane.
1	
In the Smart Controls pane, click the first screen control (Filter) to select it.
2	
In the Smart Controls inspector, in the External Assignment area, click the Learn button.
3	
On your MIDI keyboard, turn a knob.
Don’t be timid. Move the knob all the way down and all the way up, if necessary. When 
the knob is assigned, it adjusts the Filter screen control in the Smart Controls pane.

222    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
4	
In the Smart Controls, click the second screen control (Feedback), and on your MIDI 
keyboard, turn a knob.
Repeat that procedure one more time to assign another knob to the third screen 
controller.
5	
In the External Assignment area, click the Learn button to turn it off.
6	
At the upper left of the Smart Controls pane, click the Inspector button to close the 
Smart Controls inspector.
The three unmapped screen controls are hidden, leaving you only the three screen 
controls you mapped to plug-in parameters and assigned to hardware knobs.
7	
On your MIDI keyboard, play keys while turning the three assigned knobs.
As you move the knobs on your keyboard, the corresponding screen controls move 
in the Smart Controls pane. Be careful when adjusting the Feedback parameter. If 
you leave that knob turned up, a feedback loop is created and the sound sustains and 
builds up indefinitely, so bring Feedback down after a while.
You can now save this Smart Control layout to the patch.

Using Step Input Recording
Instead of recording a performance in real-time, you can record notes one at a time. This 
technique is useful to record musical parts that would be difficult or impossible to per-
form live. Composers who take the time to choose their notes or chords will also enjoy 
this technique.
In step input mode, you position the playhead and play a note or chord on your MIDI 
keyboard. The note(s) are recorded, and the playhead moves one step ahead, ready for 
you to enter the next note(s). Before you can use step input, you need to identify a MIDI 
region to receive the notes.
1	
On the Thick Layered Synth track, Control-click the workspace in bar 1, and choose 
Create Empty MIDI Region.
A one-bar MIDI region is created.

recorded to reselect it.
12	 On the Step Input keyboard, click the Sustain Inserted Notes button.
You can now release the key on your MIDI keyboard.
In the Piano Roll, the selected note is lengthened by a step (an eighth note), so it 
becomes a quarter note. You can click the Sustain Inserted Notes button several times 
to lengthen any selected note(s) by the current step length.
Try using step input recording techniques to record fast sixteenth-note arpeggios, or 
even crazy chord patterns. With a little experimentation, you will quickly end up with 
cool musical phrases that couldn’t possibly be performed live.

14	 Listen to the part you recorded.
15	 Close this project, and save it only if you want to revisit it later. (You will no longer 
need it for this book.)
Processing MIDI Notes with MIDI Plug-Ins
MIDI effects are plug-ins that can process the MIDI data coming from the track, whether 
generated in real time with your MIDI keyboard, or from the MIDI regions on the track 
during playback, before it reaches the instrument plug-in. A MIDI plug-in may change 
the pitch and velocity of notes, or even create new MIDI note or controller events.
In this last exercise you will experiment with holding down a chord on your MIDI keyboard, 
and processing the chord through the Arpeggiator MIDI plug-in, which automatically arpeg-
giates the chord’s notes while staying in sync with the project.

20	 Drag the Rate knob down to 1/8.
The Arpeggiator slows down and plays eighth notes. You can also click the Rate field 
above the knob to directly choose the desired rate.
NOTE ▶ ​The project tempo is 85 bpm, a slow tempo, and 1/8 is a slow rate, which 
makes it easy to hear the results of your experiments with the Arpeggiator param-
eters. Don’t hesitate to raise the tempo and the rate after you finish this exercise. With 
the right pattern and sound, fast arpeggios can be a lot of fun!
At the bottom of the Arpeggiator in the Pattern area, Live mode is highlighted. In Live 
mode, the notes play at the same velocity you played them on your keyboard. The Grid 
mode offers more flexibility, but first let’s make the Retro Synth more sensitive to veloc-
ity, so that lower velocity MIDI notes will trigger lower level notes in the instrument.

242    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
21	 In the Retro Synth, at the lower right, drag the Velocity slider (Vel) all the way to 
the top (1.00).
Assuming that you played notes with different velocities, the lower velocity notes now 
play more quietly. You will now use the Grid mode to customize the arpeggio pattern.
22	 In the Pattern area, click the Grid button.
Velocity bar
The Arpeggiator is now in Grid mode, and plays all the notes at the same velocity 
corresponding to the height of the velocity bar on step 1.
23	 At the bottom of the Pattern area, from the Pattern pop-up menu, choose Grooving 
Pulse 01.
The pattern is loaded to the grid, and you can hear your chord arpeggiated while fol-
lowing the pattern. Note that some of the steps on the grid are turned off, and one 
note is wider than the others and lasts for two steps.

24	 From the Pattern pop-up menu, choose Chordal Jam 01.
Step on/off button
Chord on/off button
In this pattern, some of the steps have the chord on/off button lit, and they play the 
whole chord rather than a single note.
25	 Feel free to customize the pattern:
▶
▶Drag a velocity bar up/down to adjust the note velocity.
▶
▶Drag a velocity bar left/right to adjust the note length.
▶
▶Click the step number to toggle that step on or off.
▶
▶Click the chord symbol to make that step play a single note or the whole chord.
26	 Now that you have a better grasp on the Arpeggiator, feel free to choose a faster rate 
with the Rate knob.
While arpeggiators can be a great source of inspiration, they can also become tire-
some quickly if they always play the same patterns. One way to keep things fresh is to 
let the sound of the synth evolve progressively as the arpeggio plays.
In Retro Synth, try playing with the Filter section as you did earlier in this exercise. 
Also try playing with the amplifier envelope (AMP ENV) by dragging the handles on 
the display or adjusting the four parameters around the display, Dec(ay), Sus(tain), 
Att(ack), and Rel(ease). Try making the sound of the synth evolve from long enve-
lopes to very short ones.

244    Recording MIDI and Using Controllers
You have used the Arpeggiator MIDI plug-in to process a simple chord played on your 
keyboard into simple and complex arpeggios. You’ve learned how to choose different note 
orders and their variations, and to expand the arpeggio over multiple octaves. You also 
chose different grid patterns and customized them to make your own.
MIDI plug-ins give you more tools in your arsenal to process MIDI events in real time. 
Feel free to continue exploring the possibilities, perhaps by choosing different instruments 
to arpeggiate.

When you work with MIDI sequences, the flexibility of separating the 
performance data from a specific instrument gives you total control 
over the performance data, even after it is recorded. You can open the 
MIDI region in a MIDI editor to precisely fine-tune each note’s posi-
tion, pitch, velocity, and length. You can edit or add MIDI controller 
events to automate the instrument’s volume, panning, pitch, and many 
other parameters. You can also write music from scratch, creating notes 
in MIDI editors using only your mouse, similar to the way you write 
music on staff paper.
Writing music in MIDI editors is also called programming MIDI 
sequences. Logic includes several MIDI editors for this purpose, and 
though they all display the same MIDI events, each does so in its own 
way. For example, the Score Editor shows you musical notes on a staff, 
and the Piano Roll Editor shows you notes as beams on a grid.
In this lesson, you will program and edit MIDI events using the Logic 
MIDI editors. You will write a bass line and a syncopated organ groove, 
import and edit a MIDI file, and program MIDI control automation to 
breathe life into your MIDI sequences.
Creating and Editing MIDI
Lesson 6

248    Creating and Editing MIDI
Creating MIDI Notes in the Piano Roll Editor
The Piano Roll Editor is the most straightforward MIDI editor in Logic. Its name is 
inspired by the perforated paper roll used by mechanical player pianos, in which the posi-
tion and length of those perforations determined the pitches and lengths of notes.
In Logic, the Piano Roll Editor represents MIDI notes as beams on a grid, positioned 
below a bar ruler, much like the workspace displays regions on a grid below a bar ruler. In 
fact, most of the techniques for editing regions in the workspace also apply to notes in the 
Piano Roll Editor.
Creating and Resizing Notes
In the Piano Roll Editor, you create notes by clicking in the grid with the Pencil tool. 
As you write your musical part using the Pencil tool, you can also use the Pencil tool to 
resize, move, copy, or delete notes.
You will open a new project that has a basic rock drum track, create a new bass track, and 
use the Pencil tool to program a simple bass line in the Piano Roll.
1	
Open Logic Pro X Files > Lessons > 06 Rock Drums.
The project contains a single Drummer track looping for eight bars. Listen to the 
drums. They play a straightforward rock drum pattern with a simple fill at the end of 
the eight-bar pattern.
2	
Choose Track > New Software Instrument Track (or press Command-Option-S).
3	
In the control bar, click the Library button (or press Y).
4	
In the Library, choose Bass > Stinger Bass.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Piano Roll Editor    249
5	
On the Stinger Bass track, Control-click in bar 1, and choose Create Empty MIDI 
Region.
An empty, one-bar MIDI region is created that starts exactly on bar 1.
6	
Double-click the new Stinger Bass region.
The Piano Roll opens and displays that region.
7	
In the Piano Roll, click the keys on the piano keyboard.
The keys trigger the bass instrument, and you can hear the bass notes.
As you position the mouse pointer over the grid, look at the info display at the top of 
the Piano Roll. Scroll down to find A1, two white keys below C2. On the grid, light 
gray lanes correspond to the white keys on the piano keyboard, while dark gray lanes 
correspond to the black keys. 
Info display

250    Creating and Editing MIDI
NOTE ▶ ​If you cannot see the info display, try making the main window wider or 
close side panes such as inspectors and browsers.
You will now use the Pencil tool, your current Command-click tool, to create notes.
8	
Command-click the light gray lane at 1 1 1 1 in front of the A1 note.
Clicking the grid with the Pencil tool inserts a note on the closest grid line to the left, 
such as clicking at 1 1 1 181 inserts a note at 1 1 1 1.
By default, Logic creates a quarter note. You will resize the note to an eighth note.
9	
Position the pointer over the right edge of the note until it changes to a Resize tool.
10	 Drag the Resize tool to the left to shorten the note to an eighth note.
The help tag shows the note length as 0 0 2 0, which indicates that the length is 0 bars, 
0 beats, 2 divisions, and 0 ticks. By default, the division is set to 1/16, so two divisions 
make an eighth note.
11	 Command-click after the existing eighth note to create a new note at 1 1 3 1.
A new note is created with the same length as the previous eighth note.
NOTE ▶ ​When creating a note, the new note has the same length as the note you 
most recently created or clicked with the Pencil tool.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Piano Roll Editor    251
You can check the position and pitch of a note by placing the pointer over the note and 
holding down the mouse button. After a pause, a help tag appears with the information.
This time you will create and resize a note in a single operation.
12	 Using the Pencil tool, hold down the mouse button to create a C2 after the last note 
(at 1 2 1 1) and drag to the right to lengthen the note to a quarter note (0 1 0 0).
Defining Note Length with Existing Notes
To finish this first bar, you will repeat the same rhythmic motif (two eighth notes followed 
by a quarter note) on new pitches. You’ll select existing notes to create notes of the same 
length and velocity.
1	
Click one of the two eighth notes at the beginning of the bar to select it.
From now on, clicking with the Pencil tool will create eighth notes.
2	
Command-click to create a G1 at 1 3 1 1.
3	
Command-click to create another G1 at 1 3 3 1.
Now enter the quarter note.

252    Creating and Editing MIDI
4	
Click the quarter note on C2 to select it.
The next note you create will be a quarter note.
5	
Create a B1 quarter note at 1 4 1 1.
6	
Play your bass line. The melody is nice, but the bass is played too legato.
7	
Drag a rectangle around all the notes (or press Command-A) to select them.
8	
Drag the right edge of one of the selected notes toward the left to shorten it slightly. 
After you start dragging, hold down Control to adjust the length with more precision.
9	
Listen to the bass line. You can hear the individual notes with more distinction now.
You now have a one bar pattern. You could continue writing the bass line with the 
Pencil tool, but to go faster you’ll repeat the pattern throughout the remaining seven 
bars of the cycle area.
10	 Ensure that all the notes are selected, and choose Edit > Repeat (or press 
Command-R).
The Repeat Regions/Events dialog opens.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Piano Roll Editor    253
11	 Set the Number of Copies to 7, set Adjustment to Bar, and click OK.
In the Piano Roll, the selected notes are repeated on every subsequent seven bars. In 
the workspace, the region is lengthened to eight bars to accommodate the new notes. 
Let’s zoom out to see how it looks.
12	 In the Piano Roll, click the background to deselect all the notes, and press Z.
You can see your entire eight-bar bass line.
You used the Pencil tool to create notes, resize them, and define the length and velocity of 
new notes. Then you used the Repeat Regions/Events dialog to quickly fill up an eight-bar 
region with your one-bar pattern. Right now the bass line is rather repetitive, but you’ll 
add small variations in the next exercise to make it more exciting.
Editing Note Pitch Using Key Commands
Creating notes with the Pencil tool is fine when you have a clear idea of the pitches you 
want. But sometimes you may want to experiment with different pitches while listening to 
the result.

254    Creating and Editing MIDI
In this next exercise, you will add eighth-note fills to the bass at the end of every two-bar 
section, and use key commands to select notes and change their pitches.
1	
In the Piano Roll, Shift-click the four notes just before bars 3, 5, 7, and 9 to select them.
You will now resize the four selected quarter notes to make them slightly shorter than 
eighth notes and so they don’t sound too legato.
2	
Drag the right edge of one of the selected notes to the left to shorten all the selected 
notes to about 0 0 1 160. Remember to start dragging and then press and hold down 
Control (or Control-Shift for more precision) to disable snapping. 
You will now copy the selected notes.
3	
Option-drag the first selected note toward the right to 2 4 3 1.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Piano Roll Editor    255
All four selected notes are copied. Now every other bar ends with two eighth notes.
4	
Click the background to deselect all notes, and click the last eighth note of bar 2 to 
select it.
From now on, make sure the Piano Roll always has key focus. You will work with the 
following key commands to select and transpose notes:
▶
▶Left/Right Arrow—Selects previous/next note
▶
▶Option-Up/Down Arrow—Transposes up/down one semitone
▶
▶Shift-Option-Up/Down Arrow—Transposes up/down one octave
NOTE ▶ ​If you happen to press Up Arrow by mistake, the Drummer track is selected 
and the Drummer Editor opens, replacing the Piano Roll. To resume working on the 
bass, press Down Arrow to reselect the bass track and to reopen the Piano Roll.
5	
Press Shift-Option-Down Arrow.
The note is transposed down one octave (from a B1 to a B0).
6	
Listen to this new bass fill. It sounds OK, but the B0 note is a bit too low.

256    Creating and Editing MIDI
7	
Press Option-Up Arrow five times to transpose the note up five semitones (from a 
B0 to an E1).
You have several ways to check the pitch of the selected note: Look at the highlighted key 
on the piano keyboard, position the mouse pointer over the note and look at the info dis-
play, or hold down the mouse button over the note and wait for the help tag to appear.
8	
Start playback, and keep the song playing for the next few steps; you will continue 
editing note pitches while listening to the song.
9	
Press Right Arrow a few times.
Each time you press Right Arrow, the next note to the right is selected, and its sound is 
played. This can be distracting when you’re trying to focus on the result of your edits.
10	 At the top of the Piano Roll, click the MIDI Out button to turn off MIDI Out.
MIDI Out button
11	 Press Right Arrow a few more times to select the first of the last two eighth notes in bar 4.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Piano Roll Editor    257
With MIDI Out turned off, no sound is triggered as you select different notes, which 
makes hearing the song easier.
12	 Press Option-Down Arrow three times to transpose the note three semitones lower 
(from a B1 to a G#1).
13	 Press Right Arrow once, and then press Option-Down Arrow three times to transpose 
the next eighth note to the same pitch (G#1).
Continue using these key commands to edit the bass fills at the ends of bar 6 and bar 8, 
choosing pitches that sound good to you.
You now have a bass line that repeats the same one-bar pattern for eight bars, with just 
enough variation in every other bar to keep things sounding fresh.
Editing Note Velocity
When you play a MIDI keyboard, you want to control how loud each note is played. To 
judge how hard you press the keys, MIDI keyboards measure the speed at which each key 
is depressed. That speed is called velocity. When you press a key, the MIDI keyboard sends 
a note on MIDI event that contains the key number and velocity value of that note.
Higher velocities usually result in louder notes. Depending on the patch or program 
you’re using, higher velocities may also trigger different sounds or different samples, as 
they do in the sampler instrument you’re using in the Stinger Bass track. Higher-velocity 

258    Creating and Editing MIDI
notes trigger samples of a bass string that was actually plucked harder, allowing you to 
program accents or dynamic variations that sound realistic.
In this exercise, you will use different techniques to change the velocities of notes in the 
bass line, thereby changing their volumes and timbres, and making your MIDI program-
ming sound closer to a live performance.
1	
At the top of the Piano Roll, click the MIDI Out button to enable MIDI Out.
2	
Control-Option-drag to zoom in on the first three notes.
3	
In the Left-click Tool menu at the top of the Piano Roll, choose the Velocity tool (or 
press T, and then press 9).
 You can also hold down Control-Command to temporarily turn the Pointer 
tool into a Velocity tool.
4	
Using the Velocity tool, drag the first note up or down.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Piano Roll Editor    259
As you drag with the Velocity tool, the MIDI note is triggered repeatedly so that you 
can hear the sound of the note at different velocities. Notice how higher velocities 
trigger bass sounds that were plucked harder and have more attack.
The help tag displays the value of the velocity, from 1 to 127.
The velocity value is indicated by the color of the note, ranging from from cold colors 
(low velocities) to warm colors (high velocities). Velocity is also represented by the 
length of the line in the middle of the note beam.
Low velocity
Medium velocity
High velocity
By default, all the notes you previously created have a velocity of 60.
You can add a subtle accent to the first note, but you don’t want it to stand out too 
much, so settle for a velocity of 61. The first bass note now triggers a sound that has 
slightly more attack than the other notes, but the difference is subtle.
Let’s select all B1 and C2 notes and raise their velocities together.
5	
Click the background of the Piano Roll, and press Z to zoom out.
6	
On the piano keyboard, click the C2 key to select all C2 notes in the region.
7	
Shift-click the B1 key (just below C2) to add all B1 notes to your selection.

260    Creating and Editing MIDI
8	
Using the Velocity tool, drag one of the selected notes to set the velocity of all the 
selected notes to 89.
NOTE ▶ ​When multiple selected notes have different velocities, dragging them with 
the Velocity tool offsets the velocities of all notes by the same amount, and the differ-
ences in velocity between the notes are retained.
9	
Press T twice to change the Left-click tool to a Pointer tool.
10	 Click the background to deselect the notes.
All C2 and B1 notes now have a slightly warmer color because they all have a velocity 
of 89.
11	 Listen to the song. The accents on the quarter notes help make the bass groove better.
Continue adjusting the velocities of individual notes in the bass fills you created in the 
previous exercise to make them stand out a little, especially at the end of bar 8, during 
the drum fill on the Drummer track.
Tip ▶  ​You can Control-click the Drummer region and choose Convert > Convert to 
MIDI Region to edit the region in MIDI editors such as the Piano Roll Editor.

Creating MIDI Notes in the Score Editor    261
Creating MIDI Notes in the Score Editor
The Score Editor displays MIDI notes as standard Western music notation. If you prefer 
composing with notation, this could become your editor of choice. And even if you don’t, 
you can use it to print sheet music for other musicians.
Creating an Organ Part in the Score Editor
Now that you have a rhythmic foundation with your drums and bass tracks, you will add 
a new organ track. Using the Score Editor, you will write a part where the left hand alter-
nates with the right hand in a syncopated rhythm.
1	
Choose Track > New Software Instrument Track (or press Command-Option-S).
2	
In the Library, choose Vintage B3 Organ > Classic Rock Organ, and play your MIDI 
keyboard to hear the Classic Rock Organ patch.
3	
Control-click the organ track in bar 1, and choose Create Empty MIDI Region.
4	
At the top of the Piano Roll, click Score (or press N).
5	
At the top of the Score Editor, drag the vertical zoom slider (or press Command-
Down Arrow a few times) to zoom in.
Make sure you can comfortably see both staves (a staff is a set of five lines).

262    Creating and Editing MIDI
6	
In the inspector, from the Part box, drag a quarter note to the top staff in the Score 
Editor to create an A3 at 1 1 1 1.
As you drag the note to the staff, you can hear the sound played on the instrument, 
and a help tag displays the current position and pitch of the note. Let’s copy that A3  
to an A2 (one octave below).
 To open the Part box as a floating window, drag it out of the inspector by its 
title bar.
7	
In the Score Editor, Option-drag the A3 quarter note down one octave to an A2 at the 
same position (1 1 1 1).
When you release the mouse button, the display updates and the new A2 note is 
placed on the lower staff.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Score Editor    263
In the Score Editor, deselected notes are black, and selected notes are green.
You will now use the Pencil tool, your current Command-click tool, to create notes.
8	
In the Part box, click the eighth note to select it.
9	
On the top staff, Command-drag to create and position a note until its help tag reads 
Position: 1 2 1 1 and Pitch: E4.
When you release the mouse button, the eighth note is created. It is displayed as a 
quarter note for now because in the Region inspector, the Interpretation checkbox is 
selected by default to produce legible music notation. If you want, you can open the 
Piano Roll to check the exact length of the note you entered.

264    Creating and Editing MIDI
10	 Option-drag the E4 note up to a G4 at the same position (1 2 1 1), and listen to the song.
You have the beginning of a rhythmic organ part. You will now add syncopated notes 
to make it groove.
11	 Drag a rectangle around the A2 and A3 notes at 1 1 1 1 to select them, and Option-
drag the notes to 1 2 3 1. Be sure to drag them horizontally to keep the same pitches.
 While you’re dragging, you can press Shift once to limit the dragging to one 
direction, either vertical or horizontal. While still dragging, press Shift again to return 
to the default behavior.
12	 Drag a rectangle around the E4 and G4 notes at 1 2 1 1 to select them, and Option-
drag them to 1 2 4 1, keeping the same pitches. Then listen to the organ.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Score Editor    265
The organ plays a grooving pattern. To change the last chord, let’s change the pitch of 
the two last notes.
13	 Click the background of the Score Editor to deselect the notes, and drag the last E4 to 
a D4, and the G4 to an F#4. Listen to the organ.
The new chord at the end gives the pattern more movement. Making some of the 
notes shorter could improve the groove, as you’ll discover in the next exercise.
Adjusting Note Lengths in the Score Editor
As you observed in the previous exercise, the Score Editor doesn’t always display the pre-
cise note lengths because doing so might make the notation virtually unreadable. How-
ever, you can choose to superimpose duration bars on the notes. You can then drag the 
right edge of the duration bars to adjust the note length in the same way you’d adjust the 
length of a note in the Piano Roll.
1	
In the Score Editor, choose View > Duration Bars > All Notes.
Beams representing the length of the notes appear.

266    Creating and Editing MIDI
2	
Select the A2 and A3 notes at 1 2 3 1.
3	
Drag the right edge of the selected notes’ duration bars to the left to shorten them to 
0 0 0 232 (a few ticks short of a sixteenth note). Listen to the organ.
With the notes shortened, the organ grooves even better now. Let’s duplicate the pattern 
in bar 2.
4	
Drag a rectangle around all the notes (or press Command-A) to select them.
All the notes are green.
5	
Choose Edit > Repeat Events (or press Command-R).
The Repeat Regions/Events dialog opens.
6	
Set the Number of Copies to 1, ensure that Adjustment is still set to Bar, and click OK.
The same pattern is repeated in bar 2. Now you will slightly change the pattern in bar 2 
to make the two first notes play on the upbeat.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating MIDI Notes in the Score Editor    267
7	
Click the background to deselect all the notes. Select the A2 and A3 notes at the 
beginning of bar 2, and drag them to the right to 2 1 3 1.
You will now shorten those two notes into eighth notes.
8	
Resize the duration bar of one of the two selected notes to 0 0 1 232.
9	
Click the background to deselect all the notes.
10	 Choose View > Duration Bars > Off.
Using the Score Editor, you entered notes and adjusted their lengths to create an organ 
rhythm part. However, some of the notes played by the left hand are displayed on the 
upper staff, which makes the score difficult to read. You will fix that in the next exercise.

268    Creating and Editing MIDI
Adjusting the Score’s Display
Let’s now adjust the way the Score Editor displays your organ part so that notes played by 
the left hand are on the lower staff and notes played by the right hand are on the upper staff.
In Logic you have to first select a polyphonic style and then separate the notes into two 
voices (one for each staff).
1	
In the Region inspector, set Style to Piano 1/3.
This choice places all the notes on the upper staff. You can separate them into two 
voices using the Voice Separation tool.
2	
Click the Left-click Tool menu at the top of the Score Editor (or press T), and choose 
the Voice Separation tool (or press 7).
3	
Drag the Voice Separation tool between the A octaves at the bottom and the chords at 
the top.
As you drag the Voice Separation tool, it draws a blue line.
 If you make a mistake, don’t release the mouse button. Instead, drag to the 
left to erase your mistake, then resume drawing the blue line.

Creating MIDI Notes in the Score Editor    269
4	
Click the background to deselect all the notes.
The line you drew separates the notes shown on the treble clef from the note on the bass 
clef. A musician reading the score can clearly distinguish the notes played by the left 
hand (on the lower staff) from the ones played by the right hand (on the upper staff).
 To print or export a score as a PDF, make sure the Score Editor has key focus, 
and choose File > Print.
5	
Listen to the organ.
You can’t hear the notes on the lower staff! That’s because when using the Piano 1/3 
staff style, separating voices assigns the notes on the upper staff to MIDI channel 1 
and the notes on the lower staff to MIDI channel 3. The Classic Rock Organ patch 
you chose earlier in the Library loads a multi-timbral Vintage B3 instrument plug-in 
on the channel strip, which uses different MIDI channels to trigger the upper and 
lower manuals (keyboards meant to be played with the hands) and pedals (keyboard 
meant to be played by the feet).
Let’s open the Vintage B3 plug-in window and look at the MIDI channel assignments.
6	
On the Classic Rock Organ channel strip in the Inspector, click the middle of the Vin-
tage B3 plug-in slot to open its plug-in window.
7	
At the bottom right of the Vintage B3 plug-in, click Split.

270    Creating and Editing MIDI
The three keyboards are displayed along with their MIDI channel (CHANNEL) 
assignments:
▶
▶Channel 3 triggers the pedals.

Close the Vintage B3 plug-in window, and listen to the organ.
This time you can hear the left hand (the notes on the lower staff, on MIDI channel 3) 
play the lower manual, while the right hand (the notes on the upper staff, on MIDI 
channel 1) play the upper manual.

Importing a MIDI File    271
12	 Listen to the song. The organ pattern sounds good, and the small rhythmic variation 
at the beginning of every other bar helps the groove.
In the Score Editor, you’ve created notes by dragging them from the Part box, copying 
existing notes, or using the Pencil tool. Finally you adjusted their lengths using duration 
bars. You have a grooving organ part that complements the drums and bass.
Importing a MIDI File
MIDI events recorded by software and hardware MIDI sequencers (including Logic) can 
be saved in standard MIDI file (SMF) format. Most sequencers can export and import 
standard MIDI files, which makes it easy to open them in multiple software sequencers, or 
share them with others.
In the following exercise, you will import a MIDI file containing an eight-bar synth per-
formance that you’ll edit later in the Event List.
1	
In the control bar, click the Browsers button (or press F), and at the top of the Brows-
ers area, click All Files.
The All Files Browser displays all the files on your hard drive that can be used by 
Logic: audio files, MIDI files, movie files, and Logic and GarageBand projects.

At the top of the All Files Browser, click the Home button to list the contents of your 
home folder.

3	
Navigate to Desktop > Logic Pro X Files > Media > Additional Media and drag Lead 
Synth.mid to bar 1 at the bottom of the workspace.
A new software instrument track is created, and a Steinway Grand Piano patch is 
loaded by default. An eight-bar region named Lead Synth is created on the track. The 
gray vertical bars in the region represent MIDI control events.
4	
Listen to the song. You can hear a piano, but it’s panned to the left and a little too low 
in volume.
5	
In the Steinway Grand Piano track header, drag the Volume slider up, and drag the 
Pan knob to the center position. Start playback.
 In Logic, you can return most parameters to their default values by Option-
clicking them. This is particularly useful to bring a Volume fader back to zero or a 
Pan knob to the center.
As the playhead jumps to bar 1 (the beginning of the cycle area) and playback starts, 
the Volume slider and the Pan knob revert to their original positions. MIDI files can 
contain controller volume and pan events, and when Logic plays those events, it uses

them to set the volume and pan settings of the track. You’ll use the Event List later to 
delete them.
6	
Stop playback, and press Return to go to the beginning of the song.
 To export a MIDI region(s) as a standard MIDI file, select the region(s) in the 
workspace, and choose File > Export > Selection as MIDI File.
Editing MIDI Data in the Event List
The Event List shows MIDI events as text and numbers. Unlike other MIDI editors—such 
as the Piano Roll Editor or the Score Editor—which can be more convenient for cre-
ative tasks, the Event List displays all the MIDI events in a region, along with the exact 
numerical values of their attributes (such as MIDI channel, key number, velocity, and so 
on). While you probably won’t use the Event List to compose, it can be a very powerful 
troubleshooting tool.
You will now open a MIDI file (that you imported in the previous exercise) in the Event 
List to locate and delete those MIDI events responsible for automatically setting the vol-
ume and pan on the channel strip.
1	
In the control bar, click the Lists button to open the Event List.

Playhead
The Event List displays all the MIDI events inside the selected Lead Synth region. You 
can see Control, Note, and C-Press (channel pressure, or aftertouch) events. A thin 
white horizontal playhead scrolls the events during playback. At the top of the Event 

274    Creating and Editing MIDI
List, the first two MIDI events are a volume and a pan event. They are responsible for 
setting a specific volume and pan to the channel strip when playing that region. Let’s 
delete all MIDI events that are not notes. 
You can use the event type buttons to filter the events displayed.
2	
Click the Notes event type button to disable it.
Note events are hidden. You will now delete all the Control and C-Press events.

Choose Edit > Delete (or press Delete) to delete all the Control and C-Press events.
5	
Click the Notes event type button to enable it.
Notice that only Note events remain in the Lead Synth region.
6	
Raise the volume and center the pan of the Steinway Grand Piano track and listen to 
the song.
This time the Volume slider and Pan knob in the track header stay put, and you can 
hear your piano loud and centered. Let’s change the patch to a synth.

7	
In the workspace, make sure the Steinway Grand Piano track is selected, and in the 
Library, choose Synthesizer > Lead > Citrus Fuzz. Listen to the song.
The synth plays a lot of fast notes, and then plays a very simple melody. You will 
breathe new life onto the synth performance later in this lesson by inserting your own 
controller events.
Quantizing Pitches, Scales, and Timings of MIDI Notes
In this exercise you will quantize note pitches to certain keys and scales, forcing them to snap 
to the nearest note in that key. You will also quantize their timings to a grid, and adjust the 
strength of the quantizations to retain some of the human feel from the original performance.
1	
In the workspace, double-click the Lead Synth region to open it in the Piano Roll Editor, 
and press Z to see all the notes.
2	
Select all five notes in bars 4 and 5.
Let’s try to play the selected notes in another key.

276    Creating and Editing MIDI
3	
In the Piano Roll inspector, from the left Scale Quantize pop-up menu, choose A. Listen 
to the song.
Key
Scale
The notes jump to pitches in the key of A Major. You can use the Scale Quantize fea-
ture to experiment with playing a melody or chord progression in different keys. In 
this case, though, the original notes worked best.
4	
From the Scale Quantize pop-up menu, choose Off to return the notes to their origi-
nal pitches. Listen to the song again.
This time pay attention to the timing of the selected notes. It sounds as if the notes 
are really behind the beat.
5	
Press Z to zoom in on the selected notes.
On the grid, you can see that the notes start late.
6	
In the Piano Roll inspector, from the Time Quantize pop-up menu, choose 1/4 Note.
The notes snap to the nearest beat.
www.ebook3000.com

Editing MIDI Data in the Event List    277
Listen to the song. The notes you’ve quantized are perfectly in time. But rather than 
snapping the notes to a rigid grid, you want to retain some of the original feel using 
the Time Quantize Strength slider.
As the song plays, the Piano Roll constantly updates its display to show the position 
of the playhead. After you’ve stopped playback, the notes you wanted to see are still 
selected, so you can press Z to bring them back into view.
7	
Press Z. The selected notes fill the Piano Roll.
8	
In the Piano Roll inspector, drag the Strength slider down to 50.
The notes are now positioned halfway between their original positions and the near-
est quarter note on the grid.
9	
In the Piano Roll, click the background to deselect all notes, and press Z to display all 
the notes. Listen to the song.
The synth’s timing sounds better, but it still retains a bit of its original laid-back feel.
Creating a Crescendo Using Note Velocity
In the following exercise, you will employ a new technique to edit the velocity of the very 
fast notes at the beginning of the synth region, and make them play a crescendo (scaling 
note velocities from lower to higher values).
1	
At the top of the Piano Roll, click the MIDI Draw button (or press Command-Y).
MIDI Draw button

278    Creating and Editing MIDI
The MIDI Draw area opens at the bottom of the Piano Roll.
MIDI Draw area
 If you need more display space to work in, choose Window > Open Piano 
Roll (or press Command-4) to open a full-screen Piano Roll window.
The MIDI Draw area displays the velocity of each MIDI note as a node, along with a 
line representing the length of the note. The height of each node represents the veloc-
ity of the note above it on the grid. You adjust the velocity of a note by vertically drag-
ging the node (not the line).
2	
Drag up the node of the first note in bar 4 to raise its velocity.
As you drag the node, a help tag shows you the position, pitch, and velocity of the 
note. When you release the mouse button, the color of the note beam in the Piano 
Roll updates to reflect the new velocity.
www.ebook3000.com

Editing MIDI Data in the Event List    279
3	
Listen to the fast notes at the beginning. They all sound fairly loud. You will now 
draw a line in the MIDI Draw area to create a crescendo in bar 1.
4	
In the MIDI Draw area, drag with the pointer to draw a line up from the lower left to 
the beginning of the long, sustained note at bar 2.
The note velocities are aligned to the green line you drew.
5	
Listen to the synth. You can hear the notes crescendo; however, the first few notes are 
very soft and you can barely hear them.
Let’s raise the velocity of all the notes while keeping the crescendo you just drew.
6	
In the Piano Roll inspector, drag the Velocity slider all the way up, and listen to the synth.

280    Creating and Editing MIDI
The velocities of all the selected notes are raised by the same amount, and the cre-
scendo is now louder. In fact, the crescendo could use a gentler slope so that the sus-
tained note in bar 2 doesn’t have such a high velocity.
7	
With the notes still selected, in the MIDI Draw area, drag down the node of the sus-
tained note at bar 2.
This time the note velocities are adjusted proportionately. For example, if you dragged 
one selected note velocity to half of its value, then the velocities of all the other 
selected notes are also halved. This gives your crescendo a gentler slope.
8	
Listen to the synth. It is now easier to hear the first few notes, but the last note is no 
longer too loud.
 You can also use MIDI Draw in the Score Editor by clicking the MIDI Draw 
button at the top; and in the Tracks area by selecting one or more regions and choos-
ing View > MIDI Draw > Autodefine (or pressing Command-Y).
Creating and Editing MIDI Continuous Controllers
When playing a MIDI keyboard, you can add expression to your performance using 
knobs, sliders, wheels (such as the pitch bend and modulation wheels), or a volume pedal. 
Manipulating those controllers sends a stream of control events that represent the move-
ment of the controller knob and trigger an action on the instrument.
When programming MIDI, you can draw a stream of control events to alter an instru-
ment’s volume, pitch, and other parameters. In the following exercises, you will use the 
Logic MIDI editors to automate pitch bend and modulation in the synth MIDI region.

MORE ​INFO ▶  ​Control data is often referred to as region-based automation, as 
opposed to track-based automation, which you’ll explore in Lesson 10.
Automating Pitch Bend Data in MIDI Draw
Adding pitch glides at the beginnings or ends of notes can make a MIDI sequence sound 
musical. Let’s enliven your synth performance by bending the pitch in various places, and 
adding a vibrato at the end of a sustained note.
1	
In the MIDI Draw inspector, from the Controller pop-up menu, choose Pitch Bend.
The MIDI Draw inspector shows an empty canvas, ready for you to draw pitch bend 
automation. First, you will draw a pitch drop from the beginning to the end of the fast 
notes in bar 1. You can use the Pencil tool, your current Command-click tool, to enter 
new control points.
2	
At the upper left of the MIDI Draw area, Command-click to create a control point.
 You can also double-click with the pointer to create control points.

282    Creating and Editing MIDI
3	
In the lower part of the MIDI Draw area, Command-click at bar 2 to get a value of 
about –62. Listen to the first bar of the synth.
You can hear the fast notes drop down in pitch throughout bar 1. However, the rest of 
the notes play at the wrong pitch. To play the remaining notes at their correct pitches, 
you must return the pitch to the horizontal gray middle line, which represents the 
position of the 0 value (the center position on a MIDI keyboard’s Pitch Bend wheel).
4	
A little before bar 3, Command-click to create a control point on the horizontal green 
line that has the same value as the previous control point you created.
Predicting the exact value of a control point you create can be a bit tricky in the MIDI 
Draw area. If you didn’t get the right value, use the Pointer tool to drag the control 
point up or down to the same value as the previous control point.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing MIDI Continuous Controllers    283
 To delete a control point, double-click it with the Pointer tool. To delete mul-
tiple control points, drag around them to select them, and then press Delete on your 
keyboard.
5	
A little after bar 3, create a control point, and drag it to a value of 0. Listen to the 
synth.
The pitches of the fast notes in bar 2 drop over a range of four semitones, then the 
sustained note is bent at bar 3, going back up two semitones. You will make the pitch 
variations more pronounced by increasing the pitch bend range.
The MIDI pitch bend events do not include any pitch bend range information, so it’s 
up to the instrument receiving the events to determine which pitch bend range to use. 
As with the instrument used here, most instruments default to a range of two semi-
tones above or below the original pitch. And most instruments allow you to adjust the 
pitch bend range. You will now open the ES2 instrument plug-in on the Citrus Fuzz 
channel strip in the inspector to adjust its pitch bend range.
6	
On the Citrus Fuzz channel strip, click the middle of the instrument slot.
The ES2 plug-in opens.

284    Creating and Editing MIDI
Pitch bend range
7	
In the ES2, set the upward Bend range field to 12 semitones (one octave).
Upward Bend range
Downward Bend range
The downward Bend range field is set to link, which means that the downward Bend 
range value is set the same as the upward Bend range value. You can now bend notes 
up to one octave above or one octave below the original pitch.
8	
Listen to the synth. The fast notes at the beginning drop down two octaves, then the 
sustained note comes back up one octave to the original pitch.
However, unless you got very lucky, the beginning of the sustained note sounds out of 
tune. You most likely need to adjust the pitch bend value in that section to make sure 
that it is all the way down (so that part of the note is exactly one octave lower than the 
original pitch of the note).
9	
Close the ES2 plug-in window (or press Command-W).
10	 In the MIDI Draw area, drag down the horizontal line between the two control points 
in bar 2 all the way to a value of –64. Listen to the synth again.
This time the beginning of that sustained note sounds in key, exactly one octave 
below the original pitch.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing MIDI Continuous Controllers    285
Holding down Control-Shift turns the pointer into an Automation Curve tool you can 
use to curve the lines joining two control points of different values. (You can’t curve a 
horizontal line.)
11	 Control-Shift-drag the line between the –64 and 0 values (around bar 3).
Drag up or down to create a convex or concave curve, respectively. Drag left or right 
to create a horizontal or vertical S curve, respectively.
 To create more complex shapes, drag the Pencil tool to draw the desired 
automation.
12	 Control-Shift-drag that same line to the right to create an S curve.
The pitch glide in the middle of the sustained note is now a little faster.
 In MIDI Draw, Control-Shift-click a curved line to revert to a straight line.
Copying MIDI Control Data in MIDI Draw
Let’s continue automating the pitch bend data in the Lead Synth region. You will raise the 
next three notes in bar 4 from lower pitches to their correct pitches at the beginning of 
each note. Then, create the desired pitch bend automation for one note, and copy it to the 
two other notes.

286    Creating and Editing MIDI
1	
In the Piano Roll, zoom in on the three quarter notes in bar 4.
2	
Command-click the green line to create a control point to the left of the first note, 
and make sure it has a value of 0.
3	
Create a control point about halfway down, and drag it horizontally between the pre-
vious control point and the beginning of the note.
4	
Create a control point a little before the middle of the note with a value of 0. Listen to 
your synth.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing MIDI Continuous Controllers    287
The note now starts on a low pitch and raises up to the correct pitch (similar to the 
way Frank Sinatra often glided up into the correct pitch).
You will now apply the same pitch bend automation to the two following notes.
5	
At the bottom of the Piano Roll, drag the horizontal scroll bar to scroll back to the 
three notes in bar 4.
6	
Drag a selection rectangle around the three control points at the beginning of the 
first note.
7	
Option-drag the selected pitch bend data to the beginning of the second note.

288    Creating and Editing MIDI
8	
Option-drag the selected pitch bend data below the second note to the beginning of 
the third note. Listen to your synth.
All three notes have their pitches raising to their correct pitches at the beginning of 
each note, which makes them more expressive.
9	
Using the techniques you’ve learned in this exercise, drop down the pitch of the last 
sustained note in the region an entire octave before the end of the note (around bar 8).
Automating Modulation Data in MIDI Draw
When listening to singers or string players, you may notice that they often use vibrato, 
and tend to use it more toward the end of sustained notes. On synthesizers, the modu-
lation wheel (often located to the left of the keys) frequently controls the depth of the

vibrato. You will now add some modulation automation to the synth to add vibrato to the 
end of the first sustained note.
1	
In the MIDI Draw inspector, from the Controller pop-up menu, choose Modulation.
2	
At bar 3, in the very bottom of the MIDI Draw area, Command-click to create a con-
trol point with a value of 0.
Notice that Logic creates another control point with the same value at the beginning 
of the region.
NOTE ▶ ​If the control point you entered doesn’t have the right value, drag down the 
horizontal line between the two points to adjust both values simultaneously.
3	
In the middle of bar 3, at the very top of the MIDI Draw area, Command-click to cre-
ate a control point with a value of 126. Listen to your synth.

290    Creating and Editing MIDI
You can hear the vibrato effect come in after the sustained note’s pitch goes up an 
octave at bar 3. However, the vibrato currently stays at its maximum value for the 
remainder of the region.
4	
In the MIDI Draw area, create a control point with a value of 126 right after the end 
of the sustained note.
5	
Create a control point with a value of 0 after the point you just created, but before the 
beginning of the next note. Listen to your synth.
Now the vibrato applies only to the first sustained note, and the next notes don’t 
have any. This synth is now much more expressive than it was when you originally

imported its MIDI file into the project. You will now add some audio effects to add 
even more life to the sound.
6	
In the control bar, click the Smart Controls button (or press B).
7	
Drag the Delay knob to about three quarters of its range, and drag the Scream knob 
halfway up.
8	
Listen to the song, and adjust other Smart Controls knobs as you listen to their effect 
on the synth sound.
9	
Now that you’re done editing the synth, you can turn it down (try about –10 dB), then 
turn the organ down a bit as well (around –4 dB). It may seem like the mix is weaker, 
so turn up your monitoring level on your audio interface (or by clicking the speaker 
icon in the Mac main menu bar) to compensate.
Bringing down the synth and organ should result in more clearly hearing the drums 
and bass.
In this lesson, you used three different MIDI editors—the Piano Roll Editor, the Score 
Editor, and the Event List—to create and edit note and control data. But they can do so 
much more! The MIDI editors in Logic are powerful tools that include numerous options 
and features.
When trying to perform a specific task, don’t hesitate to look through an editor’s local 
menu, or to Control-click an event or an area of the editor to access the shortcut menus. 
Chances are, you will find the feature you are looking for and discover even more useful 
features you wouldn’t have imagined.

The use of loops and samples has become omnipresent in modern 
music. New technologies encourage experimentation, and it is more and 
more common to find, say, a sample of a Middle Eastern instrument 
in a modern rock song, a sample of classical music in a pop song, or a 
sample of a pop song in a hip hop track.
Mixing prerecorded material into a project can lead to exciting results, 
but the material must be carefully selected to ensure that it seamlessly 
blends into the project. The first challenge is to match the prerecorded 
musical material’s tempo with the project’s tempo.
Even when you record your own performances, precisely correcting the 
pitch and timing of an individual note can help you realize the perfec-
tion expected by a demanding audience. As with any tool, you can use 
note correction to fix imprecisions (or mistakes) in the recording, or 
you can use it creatively. Furthermore, special effects such as Varispeed 
and tape speed-up or slow-down can provide new inspiration.
Editing Pitch and Time
Lesson 7

298    Editing Pitch and Time
In this lesson, you will match the tempo and groove of audio files to make sure they com-
bine into a musical whole. You’ll manipulate the project tempo to add tempo changes and 
tempo curves, apply Varispeed and Speed Fade effects, and use Flex editing to precisely 
adjust the position and length of individual notes and correct the pitch of a vocal recording.
Setting a Project Tempo by Detecting the Tempo of a 
Recording
While listening to various recordings, you’ve found a recording of drums you like because 
of the way it grooves at its original tempo. To build a project around it, you need to adjust 
the project’s tempo to match the recording. When the two tempos match, you can use the 
grid to edit and quantize regions, or add Apple Loops and keep everything synchronized.
In this exercise, you will import a drums recording into a new project, let Logic detect the 
tempo of the drums, and set it as the project tempo.

The new Slow Drums region spans about 25 bars at the current project tempo (120 bpm).
4	
In the control bar, click the Metronome button (or press K) and listen to the drums.
At first, the metronome plays twice as fast as the drums, which were probably 
recorded at close to half the current project tempo (close to 60 bpm). After a few bars, 
the metronome and the drums drift out of sync.

In the workspace, with the Slow Drums region selected, choose Edit > Tempo > 
Adjust Tempo Using Beat Detection (or press Option-Command-T).
The “Adjust Tempo using Beat Detection” dialog opens, and identifies a resulting 
tempo of 123.0755 bpm. However, the drums tempo is actually half as fast.

In the dialog, click the Advanced Options disclosure triangle.
7	
In Advanced Options, set Adjust Value By to 1:2.
At the top of the dialog, the tempo is adjusted by a ratio of 1/2 with a resulting tempo 
of 61.5377 bpm. It’s rare to work with a tempo that has so many digits after the decimal 
point, so let’s round off that value.

8	
From the Rounding pop-up menu, choose 1 Decimal to create a resulting tempo of 
61.5 bpm.
9	
Click OK.
In the LCD display, the tempo is rounded to the nearest integer, and is displayed as 62 
bpm. Let’s switch to the custom LCD display to see the exact tempo.
10	 In the LCD display, click the note and metronome icons, and choose Custom.
The custom LCD display shows the exact tempo with four decimals, 61.5000 bpm.
11	 Listen to the song. The drums are perfectly in sync with the metronome; in fact the 
metronome is often inaudible because it is masked by the drums.
12	 Click the Metronome button (or press K) to turn it off.
Now that you’ve set the project tempo to match the drums tempo, you can add Apple 
Loops and they will automatically match the tempo of your drums. You can also use the 
grid in the workspace to cut an exact numbers of bars in a region, which you’ll need later 
in this lesson to cut a drum loop.

Using and Creating Apple Loops
Apple Loops are AIFF or CAF format audio files containing additional information that 
allows them to automatically match the tempo and key when they’re imported into a 
Logic project. They also contain descriptive information (such as instrument, mood, 
genre, and scale) that helps you search the vast library of loops using the Loop Browser.
Using the Loop Browser
You were introduced to the Loop Browser in Lesson 1 when you previewed and chose 
loops to create a project. You will now use it to add two Apple Loops to your drums track.
1	
In the control bar, click the Apple Loops button (or press O).
2	
At the top of the Loop Browser, from the Loop pop-up menu, choose Hip Hop.
Let’s try to find a couple of loops that were recorded at a tempo close to the current 
project tempo (61.5 bpm).
3	
At the top of the results list, click the Tempo column header.
In the results list, the loops are reordered by ascending tempos. Note that the first few 
loops do not have any tempo information, because they don’t contain any rhythmic 
material.

4	
Click Intergalactic Beat to preview it.
That loop sounds as if it would work with the drums recording.
5	
Drag Intergalactic Beat to the workspace, below the drums track at bar 1.
6	
Place the mouse pointer over the upper-right edge of the Intergalactic Beat region so 
it turns into the Loop tool, and then drag to loop the region until bar 12.
Let’s add a synth loop.
7	
In the Loop Browser, click Intergalactic Rising Synth to preview it.
Intergalactic Rising Synth plays in the current project key, which is C, by default. The 
loop’s original key, displayed in the results list, is B. Let’s listen to the loop in its origi-
nal key.
8	
At the bottom of the Loop Browser, from the “Play in” pop-up menu, choose Orig-
inal Key.
The loop now plays in B.
9	
Drag Intergalactic Rising Synth to bar 2 below the tracks in the workspace.

Using and Creating Apple Loops    303
NOTE ▶ ​Apple Loops are automatically transposed to match the root note of the proj-
ect’s key signature. However, they do not match the tonality, so loops sound the same, 
for example, in C major and in C minor.
10	 Loop the region until bar 13.
Listen to the song. The synth loop is once again playing in the key of the project, C.
You will now stop the drums on track 1 at the same position as the Intergalactic Beat loop.
11	 Command-drag the Slow Drums region from bar 12 to the end of the region.
Make sure that your marquee selection starts exactly on 12 1 1 1, but don’t worry if 
the marquee selection goes beyond the end of the region (since there’s nothing to 
delete after the region).
12	 Press Delete. This creates a click sound at the end of the Slow Drums region that 
you’ll fix later.
The Slow Drums region now ends at bar 12, as does the Intergalactic Beat loop on track 2.
Setting a Project’s Key Signature
Loops generally sound more natural when they’re played in their original keys. Their 
sound is closer to their producer’s original intention, and with no transposition to process, 
the timbre of the loop is closest to the original recording, and you hear fewer artifacts 
(distortion resulting from the time-stretching or pitch-shifting process).
Let’s change the key of the project to B minor, the original key of the synth loop you 
imported on track 3.

304    Editing Pitch and Time
1	
In the control bar, click the Lists button.
2	
At the top of the Lists area, click the Signature tab.
The Signature list shows the Time and Key signatures. The default key signature is C 
major.
3	
In the Value column, click the scale (Major).
The Key Value changes to A minor, the relative minor of C major. (Relative keys share 
the same notes, but have different tonal centers.)
4	
Click the key (A), and from the pop-up menu, choose B.
The Key signature is now B minor.

5	
Click the Lists button to close the Signature list.
6	
Listen to your song. The Intergalactic Synth plays in the new project key, B. Note that 
rhythmic loops without pitches are not affected by the project’s key, so the Intergalac-
tic Beat loop on track 2 isn’t transposed.
Creating Apple Loops
When you want to catalog a section of an audio recording so you can reuse it in future 
projects, you can save it as an Apple Loop. The Apple Loop will be indexed in the Loop 
Browser so that you can easily find it later, and it will automatically match the tempo (and, 
when appropriate, the key) of the project into which you import the loop.
In the next exercise, you will first divide the first four bars of drums, and save them as a 
new Apple Loop.
1	
Command-drag to select the first four bars in the Slow Drums.1 region from 1 1 1 1 
to 5 1 1 1.
2	
In the control bar, click the Apple Loops button (or press O) to open the Loop Browser.
3	
Using the Pointer tool, drag the selected section of the drums to the Loop Browser.
As soon as you click the marquee selection, it is divided as a new region. When you 
release the mouse button over the Loop Browser, the “Add Region to Apple Loops 
Library” dialog opens.

306    Editing Pitch and Time
4	
In the dialog, enter or choose the following:
▶
▶Name: Slow Drums
▶
▶Type: Loop
▶
▶Scale: Neither
▶
▶Genre: Rock/Blues
▶
▶Descriptors: All Drums > Kits
5	
Click the Acoustic, Clean, Dry, Grooving, and Part descriptor buttons. Descriptors deter-
mine which keyword buttons you’ll later select in the Loop Browser to find that loop.
NOTE ▶ ​When dragging a region to the Loop Browser, you can create loops only 
when the number of beats in the region is an integer. This function uses the project 
tempo to tag the transient positions and works best for audio files that match the 
project tempo. If the selected region’s number of beats is not an integer, the Type 
parameter will be set to One-shot and dimmed, and the resulting Apple Loop will not 
automatically match a project’s tempo and key.

Click Create.
Logic bounces the section as a new Apple Loop and indexes it in the Loop Browser. 
You will come back to the current project shortly, but for now let’s find the new loop 
in a new project.
7	
Choose File > New (or press Command-Shift-N) to open a new project, but do not 
close the current project.
8	
Create a track of any type, and open the Loop Browser.
9	
In the Loop Browser, in the search field, type Slow Drums.
10	 In the results list, click Slow Drums to preview it.
The loop plays at the current project tempo, 120 bpm. Notice that in the results list, 
Slow Drums does not have a key associated with it.
11	 As the loop continues playing, experiment by changing the tempo and key of the proj-
ect in the LCD display. The loop matches the project tempo, but not the project key.

12	 Click the loop to stop previewing it.
13	 Choose File > Close to close the new project, and do not save it.
You are back in the original project.
14	 Close the Loop Browser.
 You can also drag a MIDI region on a software instrument track to the Loop 
Browser to create a green Apple Loop. Green Apple Loops, like the blue Apple Loops 
you’ve already used, can be applied as audio regions on audio tracks, or as MIDI 
regions on software instrument tracks, giving you the additional flexibility of being 
able to edit the sound of the instrument and the MIDI events.

308    Editing Pitch and Time
Creating Tempo Changes and Tempo Curves
When you want to vary the tempo throughout a project, you can use the global Tempo 
track to insert tempo changes and tempo curves. All MIDI regions and Apple Loops auto-
matically follow the project tempo, even when tempo variations occur in the middle of a 
region. For non–Apple Loops audio regions (such as the Slow Drums region on track 1), 
you first have to turn on Flex for the tracks containing the regions to make those regions 
follow the project tempo.
Creating and Naming Tempo Sets
In this exercise, you will create a new tempo set, and name both the current and new 
tempo sets. You will create a new tempo curve in the new tempo set, and later switch 
between the original tempo and the new tempo curve.
1	
At the top of the track headers, click the Global Tracks button (or press G).
Below the ruler, the global tracks open. For this exercise, you need to see only the 
Tempo track.
2	
Control-click a global track header, and choose Hide Arrangement from the shortcut 
menu.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Tempo Changes and Tempo Curves    309
The Arrangement track is hidden.
3	
Repeat step 2 to hide the Marker and Signature tracks.
Only the Tempo track remains. Before you start editing the tempo, you will create a 
new tempo set and name both the current and the new sets.
4	
In the Tempo track header, from the Tempo pop-up menu, choose Tempo Sets > 
Rename Set.
A text field appears on the Tempo track header.
5	
Enter Original.
6	
From the Tempo pop-up menu, choose Tempo Sets > New Set.
A new tempo set is created with a default value of 120 bpm. A text entry field appears, 
ready for you to enter a name for the new set. In this set, you will make the tempo go 
gradually faster, so let’s name it Accelerando.
7	
Rename the new tempo set Accelerando, and listen to the song.
Both Apple Loops play at the new tempo (120 bpm), but the drums on track 1 con-
tinue playing at their original tempo. To make them follow the project tempo you 
need to choose a flex mode for their track, but only when the track is playing at its 
correct tempo.
8	
From the Tempo pop-up menu, choose Tempo Sets > Original. The project tempo is 
61.5000 bpm, the correct tempo of the drums performance.

310    Editing Pitch and Time
9	
Select the Slow Drums track header (track 1).
10	 Open the Track inspector, and set Flex Mode to Flex Time - Slicing.
This mode slices the audio where it detects a transient, and moves the slices without 
time-stretching them, which typically works great for drums.
11	 In the Tempo track, from the Tempo pop-up menu, choose Tempo Sets > Accelerando. 
Listen to the song.
This time, all three tracks follow the default 120 bpm tempo of the new tempo set.
Creating Tempo Changes and Tempo Curves
You now have two tempo sets, and will edit the new one to create a tempo that starts at a 
62 bpm tempo and progressively ramps up to about 75 bpm, dropping abruptly to 40 bpm 
for the last sustained note of the synth.
1	
In the Tempo track, drag the tempo line down to 62 bpm.
Although the line seems to stop at the bottom edge of the Tempo track, keep drag-
ging down until you see the desired tempo value displayed in the help tag. When you 
release the mouse button, the scale on the right in the Tempo track header updates 
and you can see the new tempo.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Tempo Changes and Tempo Curves    311
Let’s insert a tempo change at bar 11.
2	
In the Tempo track at bar 11, position the mouse pointer above the tempo line, and 
then double-click to insert a new tempo change, aiming for a value of 75 bpm.
A new tempo control point is inserted at bar 11. You probably didn’t get the exact 
value you had in mind, but that’s an easy fix.
3	
Place the pointer over the line to the right of the new tempo change. Then drag up or 
down to a value of 75 bpm. Listen to the tempo change.
 To reposition a tempo control point, horizontally drag the vertical line below 
the tempo change.
The tempo changes abruptly at bar 11. To smooth the tempo change, you’re going to 
accelerate the tempo from 62 bpm at bar 1 to 75 bpm at bar 11.
4	
At bar 11, position the mouse pointer on the control point below the 75 bpm control 
point.

312    Editing Pitch and Time
5	
Drag the control point to the left.
You can precisely adjust the tempo curve by dragging the control point farther to the 
left, up, or in both directions.
6	
Listen to the song. The tempo now ramps up progressively between bar 1 and bar 11.
Let’s slow the tempo at bar 12.
7	
Double-click below the tempo line at bar 12, and drag the new tempo line to 40 bpm. 
Listen to the ending.
Although the drums seem rather fast in bar 11, the last synth note in bar 12 plays very 
slowly. You can probably hear a click at bar 12, so let’s have a closer look.
8	
At the top of the track headers, click the Global tracks button (or press G) to close the 
global tracks.
9	
At bar 12, zoom in closely on the end of the last Slow Drums region on track 1.
If you zoom in close enough, you can see that the attack of the next drum hit is still 
inside the region. You need to shorten the region a tiny bit to remove that attack.
www.ebook3000.com

Adding a Turntable or Tape Slow-Down Effect    313
10	 Position the mouse pointer at the bottom right of the region, and drag to the left to 
hide the unwanted attack.
11	 Zoom out and listen again. The click at bar 12 is gone.
You can create complex tempo maps to add excitement to your arrangements. Sometimes, 
a chorus that’s a bit faster than the rest of the song is all an arrangement needs to really 
take off. Or you can use tempo curves to create the classic ritardando at the end of a song. 
All your Apple Loops and MIDI regions will automatically follow the tempo map, and you 
can use a flex mode for each audio track you want to follow along.
Adding a Turntable or Tape Slow-Down Effect
When you stop a turntable with the stylus on the record, or stop a tape machine while 
keeping the playhead in contact with the magnetic tape, the result is a sound that drops 
in pitch as it slows down. This highly recognizable effect has recently regained popularity 
along with its opposite—the sound rising in pitch as speed increases when the tape trans-
port or turntable starts.
You will now apply the turntable stop effect to the last sustained synth note at the end of 
the song. First, you need to turn that last loop into an individual region.

314    Editing Pitch and Time
1	
Using the Marquee tool, Command-drag over the last loop on the synth track (from 
12 1 1 1 to 13 1 1 1) to select it.
2	
Using the Pointer tool, click the Marquee selection.
The last two loops are turned into regions.
3	
Control-Shift-drag over the region end to create a fade-out.
Let’s turn that volume fade into a speed fade.
4	
Control-click the fade-out, and choose Slow Down from the shortcut menu.

In the workspace, the fade-out turns orange, indicating that it is now a speed fade.
5	
Listen to your fade. It sounds just like a tape stopping!
You can adjust the length and curve of the speed fade just as you would a volume fade.
6	
As you listen, adjust the fade’s curve and length as follows:
▶
▶Control-Shift-drag the middle of the fade to adjust its curve.
▶
▶Control-Shift-drag the left edge of the fade to adjust its length.
7	
Choose File > Close Project without saving the project.
You just used a speed fade to create a realistic tape slow-down effect, but you can use 
speed fades for many kinds of effects. Try applying multiple rapid speed fades to short 
regions to create DJ scratching effects. Or add a speed fade at the end of a kick sample to 
make it drop in pitch.
Making One Track Follow the Groove of Another Track
Playing all tracks at the same tempo is not always sufficient to achieve a tight rhythm. You 
also need to make sure they play with the same groove. For example, a musician may play 
slightly late to create a laid-back feel, or he may add some swing to his performance by 
delaying only the upbeats. On yet another track, notes may be placed on a rigid grid.
To learn how to get your tracks in the same groove, you will open a new project with a 
drummer playing a swing groove, and then make a shaker on another track follow the 
groove of the drummer.
1	
Open Logic Pro X Files > Lessons > 07 Swing Groove, and listen to the song.
Even though both tracks play at the same tempo, they are not synchronized. The 
drums (track 1) are playing a hip hop shuffle groove while the shaker is playing on a 
straight sixteenth note grid. Feel free to solo the individual tracks to clearly hear each 
instrument’s feel.

316    Editing Pitch and Time
Let’s zoom in so you can see the individual drum hits on the waveforms.
2	
Press Return to go back to the beginning of the project.
3	
Press Command-Right Arrow nine times to zoom in on the first two beats (so you 
can clearly see 1 and 1.2 in the ruler).
Below the 1.2 grid mark in the ruler, you can clearly see that the waveforms on the 
two tracks are out of sync.
To make the shaker follow the groove of the drums, you need to set the Drums track 
as the groove track.
4	
Control-click a track header, and from the shortcut menu, choose Track Header Com-
ponent > Show Groove Track.
At first glance, nothing seems to have changed in the track headers.
5	
Position the mouse pointer over the track number (1) of the Drums track.
A gold star appears in place of the track number.
6	
Click the gold star.
www.ebook3000.com

Making One Track Follow the Groove of Another Track    317
The gold star appears in a new column on the track header, indicating that the Drums 
track is now the groove track. On the Shaker track header, in the same column, you 
can select the checkbox to make that track follow the groove track.
7	
On the Shaker track, select the Match Groove Track checkbox.
The waveform on the Shaker track updates so that the notes are in sync with the notes 
on the groove track.
8	
Listen to the song. The shaker now follows the groove of the drums, and they play in 
sync.
9	
Solo the Shaker track.
10	 While listening to the shaker, deselect and select the Match Groove Track checkbox to 
compare the original performance with the new groove.

318    Editing Pitch and Time
When the checkbox is deselected, the shaker plays straight eighth notes and sixteenth notes.
When the checkbox is selected, the shaker plays the same hip hop shuffle feel as the 
drums.
11	 Unsolo the Shaker track.
12	 Choose File > Close Project without saving the project.
Groove tracks work with all track types (audio, software instrument, and Drummer 
tracks). Experiment by applying the groove of a sample to your MIDI programming, or 
making a Drummer track follow the groove of a live bass recording.
Change the Playback Pitch and Speed with Varispeed
In the days of analog tape recording, engineers performed all sorts of tricks by changing 
the tape speed. Many major albums were sped up ever so slightly during the mixing pro-
cess to add excitement to tracks by raising their tempos. This simultaneously raised the 
pitch, giving the impression of the vocalist reaching higher notes in the most emotional 
passages of the song. On the other hand, engineers would sometimes slow the tape dur-
ing recording, so that a musician could play a challenging passage at a more comfortable 
tempo. When played back at its regular speed during mixdown, the recording created 
the illusion of the musician playing faster. DJs are probably the biggest users of Varispeed 
techniques, which gives them control over the tempo and pitch of a track, allowing for 
seamless transitions from one track to the next.
Logic takes this concept a step further, offering both the classic Varispeed—which, like 
a tape or record player, changes both the pitch and the speed—and a Speed Only mode, 
which allows you to change the speed without changing the pitch.
1	
Open Logic Pro X Files > Lessons > 07 Little Lady, and listen to the song. In the LCD 
display in the control bar, you can see that the song is in the key of A minor and its

In the Varispeed display, click the % symbol, and from the pop-up menu, choose 
Resulting Tempo.
The Varispeed display shows the resulting tempo of 161.120 bpm. You can now use 
the display to set the desired playback tempo.
8	
Double-click the 161.120 tempo value, and enter 140 bpm.
The song plays slower, but still at its original pitch. This would be perfect for practic-
ing a part by playing along with your instrument. You could even record your part at 
this speed, and then turn off Varispeed to play the whole song (including your newly 
recorded part) at the normal speed.
Now let’s apply the classic Varispeed effect that changes both the playback speed and pitch.
9	
In the Varispeed display, click Speed Only, and from the pop-up menu, choose 
Varispeed (Speed and Pitch).
10	 Listen to the song.
Now the song plays both slower and lower in pitch. This is the classic Varispeed effect 
available on tape machines and turntables.

322    Editing Pitch and Time
The Tracks area is zoomed in vertically, and each track header shows a Flex button 
and a Flex pop-up menu.
5	
Zoom in and scroll the workspace so you can see the beginning of the Gtr Bridge L 
region (at bar 75) at the upper left of the workspace, right below the ruler.
6	
Click the lower half of the ruler at bar 75 to position the playhead. Click track 13 
to select it, and drag the zoom sliders (or press Command-Arrow keys) to continue 
adjusting your zoom level so that you can see the three first beats of bar 75 in the 
ruler (the 75, 75.2, and 75.3 grid marks).
Remember that zooming with the zoom sliders or the Command-Arrow keys keeps 
the playhead at the same horizontal position in the workspace, and the selected track 
at the same vertical position in the Tracks area. Here, the beginning of the Gtr Bridge 
L region stays anchored at the upper left of the workspace.
www.ebook3000.com

Editing the Timing of an Audio Region    323
7	
In the Gtr Bridge L track header (track 13), click the Flex button.
Flex editing is turned on. The region on the track is darker, and transient markers 
appear where Logic detected the attack of a new note. Logic automatically detects the 
most appropriate Flex Time mode for the track, which is set to Monophonic.
NOTE ▶ ​Monophonic mode is intended for instruments that produce only one pitch at a 
time (vocals, wind). Polyphonic is used with instruments that play chords (piano, guitar), 
and Slicing is for moving notes without time-stretching any audio (good for drums).
Transient markers
On track 13, the second note in the region is late. It should be in time with the second 
note of the Gtr Bridge R region on track 14 (under the 75.2 grid mark in the ruler).
8	
In the upper half of the waveform, place the mouse pointer over the transient marker 
of the second note.
The mouse pointer turns into a Flex tool and looks like a single flex marker. This sym-
bol indicates that clicking or dragging will insert a flex marker on the transient marker. 

324    Editing Pitch and Time
When you drag the flex marker, the waveform is stretched between the region begin-
ning and the flex marker, and between the flex marker and the region end. Let’s try it.
9	
Drag the Flex tool to the left to align the flex marker with the second note of the track 
below.
Flex drag indicator
When the mouse pointer is positioned over a flex marker, a flex drag indicator in the 
region header above the flex marker shows how the flex marker was moved from its 
original position. You can click the X symbol inside the flex drag indicator to delete 
that flex marker (and return the waveform to its original state).
After you release the mouse button, the flex marker looks like a white vertical line.
Flex marker

Editing the Timing of an Audio Region    325
The waveform to the left of the flex marker is blue (time-compressed) and the wave-
form to the right of the flex marker is white (time-expanded). As a result, all the 
notes to the right of the flex marker have changed their positions, which is not what’s 
wanted here.
10	 Choose Edit > Undo (or press Command-Z).
11	 In the lower half of the waveform, place the mouse pointer over the transient marker 
of the second note.
The Flex tool looks like three flex markers. Clicking it creates three flex markers:
▶
▶On the transient marker you’re about to drag
▶
▶On the transient marker before (which will not move)
▶
▶On the transient marker after (which will not move)
12	 Drag the Flex tool to the left to align the note with the second note of the track below.

326    Editing Pitch and Time
The first note is time compressed, the second note is time expanded, and the rest of 
the region remains unaffected.
13	 Listen to the edit.
The timing sounds much better than in the original. However, the first note is now 
slightly shorter, and the second note longer. It’s a subtle difference, but in the next 
exercise you will use another technique to get a tighter result.
14	 Choose Undo > Dragging (or press Command-Z) to undo the change.
Moving Waveform Sections Without Time-Stretching
In the previous exercise, you applied the Flex tool to time-stretch a waveform using either 
the previous and next transient markers or the region’s beginning and end points as 
boundaries.
Now you will use the Marquee, your current Command-click tool, to select a section of 
the waveform, and move it without time-stretching the selection
1	
In the Gtr Bridge L region, Command-drag the second note, starting on the transient 
marker.
Positioning the mouse pointer in the upper half of a marquee selection turns the 
pointer into the Hand tool, which lets you move the selected waveform without time-
stretching it.

In the workspace, scroll up to see the two bass tracks (tracks 9 and 10).
You will stretch the single note at bar 79, first in track 9, and then in track 10.
2	
Scroll and zoom as necessary so you can see the single bass note at bar 79.
3	
In the Bass track header (track 9), click the Flex button.
At bar 79, you can see a transient marker at the beginning of the note.

4	
Position your mouse pointer in the lower half of the waveform, over the end of the note.
The mouse pointer looks like three vertical lines because it is not located over a tran-
sient marker. Clicking creates three flex markers:
▶
▶At the location you click
▶
▶On the transient marker before (which will not move)
▶
▶On the transient marker after (which will not move)
5	
Drag the Flex tool to the right to end the note on 79.3.
The three flex markers are created, and the note is lengthened. The flex markers on 
the transient before (at bar 79) and after (end of bar 82) ensure that the rest of the 
region before and after the lengthened note stays unaffected.
6	
Turn on flex for the Bass Grit track (track 10), and lengthen the corresponding note 
by the same amount.

Listen to the result.
The bass note at bar 79 is sustained for a longer time. Don’t hesitate to solo the two 
bass guitar tracks, and to turn the Flex buttons on and off in the two bass track head-
ers to compare the before and after results.

Tuning Vocal Recordings
Hitting pitches perfectly on every single note can be a challenge for singers. Tuning soft-
ware allows you to correct pitches in a recording. It can be useful for saving an emotional 
take that contains a few off-pitch notes, or even to refine the pitch of a good performance.
Editing Note Pitches in the Workspace
In Logic, Flex Pitch allows you to automatically correct the pitch of all the notes in a region, 
or to precisely edit the pitch curve of a single note, along with the amount of vibrato. In 
this exercise, you will use Flex Pitch to tune the vocals on the Verse track (track 24).
1	
Solo the Verse track (track 24), and listen to the second verse (at bar 43).
The singer has a bluesy singing style with some sung parts and some spoken parts. 
You can hear the pitch glide between notes, and she usually applies vibrato at the end. 
Some of the pitches are slightly off and will benefit from pitch correction.

Zoom in on the second Verse region (at bar 43).
3	
Click the Verse track header to select it, and then click its Flex button.
Transient markers appear over the region.
4	
In the Verse track header, from the Flex pop-up menu, choose Flex Pitch.
On the region, the transient markers disappear, and you see vertical bars of various 
heights that represent the pitches detected for each note:
▶
▶A line in the center of the waveform indicates a perfect pitch.
▶
▶A bar going up indicates that the note is sharp.
▶
▶A bar going down indicates that the note is flat.
The height of the bar represents the deviation of the detected pitch from the perfect pitch.

5	
Drag the Verse 2 marker into the upper half of the ruler to make the cycle area match 
the position of the marker.
6	
Control-click the Verse region, and from the shortcut menu, choose “Set all to Per-
fect Pitch.”
All the bars in the region snap to the center of the waveform, indicating that all the 
notes are in tune.
7	
Listen to the results.
The notes are corrected to the closest pitches on a chromatic scale while retaining 
their original pitch drift and vibrato. This fix works well for most notes, but a few 
issues remain. At the beginning of bar 44, the words “get on” were corrected to the 
wrong pitch and sound flat.
8	
Control-click the Verse region, and from the shortcut menu, choose “Set all to Origi-
nal Pitch” to return the notes to their original pitches.
You can edit the pitch of individual notes in the region.

Tuning Vocal Recordings    333
9	
At the beginning of the region, Control-click the first bar (for the word “pack”), and 
from the shortcut menu, choose “Set to Perfect Pitch.”
The bar becomes a line in the center of the waveform, indicating that the note is 
tuned to a perfect pitch.
You can also drag bars up and down to manually tune a note.
10	 At bar 44, drag up the horizontal line corresponding to the words “get on.”
The singer is bending her pitch at the beginning of those two words, so it’s best to 
tune them by ear.
11	 Drag horizontally from the beginning to the end of each word (“get” and “on”). You can 
hear the pitch ramp up on each word as the singer bends the note. Find the horizontal 
position to hear the highest pitch at the end of the first word (“get”), and then try to 
drag only vertically to hear the pitch as you adjust it. You may need to zoom in closer.

334    Editing Pitch and Time
You need to drag farther up than the top of the region to tune this note. As you do so, 
the help tag no longer shows a D#3, but an E3, and the upward bar turns into a down-
ward bar. Flex Pitch no longer considers the note to be a sharp D#3, but a flat E3.
12	 Listen to Verse 2.
The singer alternates sung lines with spoken lines. It’s best not to tune the spoken 
lines. You can continue tuning the desired notes by selecting a few at a time. You may 
need to zoom out a bit for the next step.
13	 Drag the Pointer tool in bars 47 and 48 to select the words, “Tell me why, you still 
hang around.”
14	 Control-click one of the selected bars, and from the shortcut menu, choose “Set to 
Perfect Pitch.”
All selected notes are tuned to the perfect pitch.
15	 Zoom out to see the whole song.
Editing Note Pitches in the Audio Track Editor
Tuning notes in the Tracks area is quick and easy. However, you sometimes need more 
flexibility and control over the exact pitch curve of a note. The Audio Track Editor gives

you that control over the amount of pitch drift at the start or end of notes, and the amount 
of vibrato you want to retain.
1	
Drag the Verse 1 marker into the upper half of the ruler.
2	
On the Verse track (track 24), select the first Verse region (at bar 11).
3	
In the control bar, click the Editors button (or press E), and click the Track tab to 
open the Audio Track Editor.
In the Audio Track Editor menu bar, the Flex button is on, and the Flex Pitch mode is 
selected.
As in the Piano Roll Editor, the note pitches are represented as beams on a grid. (You 
may need to scroll up or down to see the note beams.) On the grid, light gray lanes 
correspond to the white keys on the piano keyboard, and dark gray lanes correspond 
to the black keys. The section of a note beam that intersects with the closest lane 
is colored, while the height of the hollowed-out section of the beam represents the 
amount of deviation from the perfect pitch. When a note plays at the perfect pitch, it 
sits exactly on a lane, and the beam doesn’t have any hollowed-out section.
On top of the frame, a light-gray line represents the pitch curve so that you can see 
pitch drifts and vibrato.

336    Editing Pitch and Time
4	
Play the first three notes of the verse (“Here you come”).
The first two notes (the words “here you”) are short and their pitches sound good so 
you will leave them unchanged.
The third note (“come”) goes sharp at the end, and you will fix that.
5	
Control-click the beam, and from the shortcut menu, choose “Set to Perfect Pitch.”
The beam snaps to the closest lane, and the entire beam is colored, indicating that the 
note plays at the perfect pitch.
Note that at the beginning of the note, the singer raises her pitch to the correct pitch, 
holds the pitch fairly straight for a short amount of time, adds a wide vibrato, and 
then drops in pitch at the end.
As you position the mouse pointer in the vicinity of the colored beam, hotspots 
appear around the beam that allow you to perform various adjustments.

Drag the lower-mid hotspot to set Vibrato to 0%.
The pitch curve of that note is flat lined.
7	
Listen to the result.
The word “come” now has a constant pitch without any drift at the beginning or end, 
and without any vibrato. The pitch is perfect, but it sounds unnatural.
8	
Drag the lower-mid hotspot to set the Vibrato to 50% to halve the pitch deviations 
around the perfect pitch.
9	
Drag the upper-left hotspot to set the Pitch Drift to 0.62 at the note start.
10	 Listen to the result.
It sounds as if the singer attacks the note with the correct pitch, which works well if 
you want a straight pitch. However, for this verse, it sacrifices the bluesy feel imparted 
by the pitch slurs and wide vibrato.

338    Editing Pitch and Time
11	 Control-click the note, and choose Reset Pitch Curve from the shortcut menu.
The pitch curve is back to the original, but the note stays on its perfect pitch.
12	 In the Tracks area, drag the left edge of the cycle area to bar 17.
13	 Unsolo the Verse track (track 24), and listen to a few bars at the beginning of the 
cycle area.
On the first beat of bar 18, the beginning of the word “sun” is very flat. In fact, the 
note is so flat that Logic detected its correct pitch as D#3 below, even though the 
singer meant to reach the E3 above.
14	 Drag up the upper-mid hotspot to set the Fine Pitch to 0 on an E3 note.
As you drag the Fine Pitch hotspot vertically, you can hear the pitch of the point in 
the pitch curve at the location of your mouse pointer. In this case, after you click the 
Fine Pitch hotspot, you can drag to the right about halfway between the middle of the 
note and the end of the note, where the pitch curve is fairly stable in the middle of the 
beam. Then drag up while listening to the pitch.
NOTE ▶ ​Sometimes, pitch correction can alter the timbre of a sound, especially when 
you play a note several semitones away from its original pitch. At some point, pitching 
up a vocal makes the singer sound like a chipmunk, whereas pitching it down makes 
the singer sound like a hulking monster. Dragging the Formant hotspot up or down 
helps you adjust the timbre to make it sound more realistic.
15	 Feel free to correct more note pitches in the two regions on the Verse track, using the 
different hotspots around the note beams to adjust the fine pitch, the pitch drifts at 
the start and end of the note, and the amount of vibrato in the pitch curve.
16	 In the Tracks area menu bar, click the Flex button (or press Command-F).
The Flex display is hidden, but all your Flex edits remain active.

In previous lessons, you recorded and edited audio and MIDI regions 
of raw musical material. Your next step is to arrange that material into 
a song: copying and repeating some elements, removing others, and 
assembling only those elements that communicate your song’s message.
In this lesson, you will start with a song that already has a good basic 
arrangement and bring it to completion, using existing material to fill in 
missing elements, and clever editing to repeat layered kick samples on 
multiple tracks. After adding a break between two sections to create a 
suspension and capture attention, you will shorten another break that is 
too long.
Previewing the Song
Before you start editing an arrangement, you must hear the song and get to 
know its structure and instrumentation.
You can use markers in the Marker track to visually identify sections in a proj-
ect. In this exercise, you will navigate a song using existing markers that help 
you familiarize with its structure. Using Solo mode, you’ll identify and audi-
tion individual tracks.

1	
Open Logic Pro X Files > Lessons > 08 Raise It Up.
2	
Click the Marker Track button.
Marker Track button
The Marker track opens with markers that identify the sections of the song (Intro, A1, 
B1, A2, B2, Break, Breakdown, and Outro).
 To create new markers, position the playhead where you want to place the 
marker, and click the Add Marker (+) button.
3	
Listen to the song.
In the A1 and B1 sections, the kick sounds rather weak, except for the first kick at the 
beginning of A1. You will later repeat the first kick samples on tracks 1 and 2 to fill in 
both sections.
In the workspace, regions are color-coded to help identify the instruments they rep-
resent. From top to bottom, the drums and percussions are blue, the bass is brown, 
guitars are yellow, keyboards are green, and vocals are purple and pink.
 To show track colors on the track headers, Control-click a track header, and 
choose Track Header Components > Show Track Color Bars.
To fully understand how the song is arranged, listen to individual instruments. You 
can click the track header Solo buttons to play each track individually, but soloing and 
unsoloing one instrument after another to preview them isn’t very efficient. Let’s use 
the Solo mode instead.
4	
In the control bar, click the Solo button (or press Control-S).
The LCD display and the playhead turn yellow to indicate that Solo mode is on. All 
the regions in the workspace are dimmed to indicate that they are muted. In Solo 
mode, only the selected regions play.

5	
On the Percussions track (track 8), click the Percussions region to select it.
The region is shaded in yellow to indicate that it is soloed.
6	
Listen to the beginning of the project.
You can hear the selected Percussions region in isolation, and identify which percus-
sion instruments were recorded on that track: handclaps, tambourine, and shaker at 
the beginning, then more percussions come in at various places throughout the song.
You can click a track header to quickly select all the regions on a track.
7	
Click the Banjo 1 track header (track 10) to select all the regions on the track.
8	
Listen to the beginning of the project.
The banjo plays with a guitar distortion effect. It sounds thin and nasal in the intro, 
and then a bit fuller in the A1 section. In the Inspector, look at the EQ display at 
the top of the Banjo 1 channel strip. You can see the EQ curve change at bar 4. That 
automated change of the EQ parameters used track automation, which you will learn 
about in Lesson 10.
9	
Start playback at the beginning, and before the end of the Banjo 1 region in A1, click 
the Piano region on track 15. The Piano region is selected, and after a little delay, you 
can hear the piano. Stop playback.
To avoid the delayed reaction of Solo mode when changing the selection, you can stop 
playback, select a new region, and resume playback. If you quickly press the Space-
bar to stop playback, click the desired region, and press the Spacebar again, you can 
become very effective at listening to different regions in the workspace.
Let’s listen to the Nana regions at the bottom of the workspace.

346    Editing an Arrangement
10	 Drag around all the pink Nana regions at bar 38 to select and solo them.
An easy way to start playback at the beginning of the selected regions is to use the 
“Play from Selection” key command.
 You can customize the control bar to add a “Play from Selection” button.
11	 Press Shift-Spacebar (Play from Selection).
The playhead jumps to the beginning of the selected regions and playback starts. You 
can hear multiple voices singing “Nah nah nah…” at various octaves. Between the sec-
tions when they’re singing, you can hear their headphone mix bleeding through their 
microphones. You will later remove that extraneous sound between sung sections.
12	 Continue selecting regions and pressing Shift-Spacebar to hear those regions in 
Solo mode.
13	 Stop playback.
14	 In the control bar, click the Solo button (or press Control-S) to disable Solo mode.
By now you should be more familiar with the song, and the sections you’re about to edit: 
the kick drums in the A1 and B1 sections, and the “nah nah” backup vocals at the end.
Copying Material to Fill in Parts
When using samples to build a rhythmic part, you often need to repeat the same sample 
(or group of samples) throughout an entire section. Depending on the length of the 
sample(s) pattern, you may need to repeat it on every beat, every bar, or every couple of 
bars. You can use several techniques to repeat sample patterns in the workspace.

Looping Regions with the Loop Tool
In this exercise, you’ll use the Loop tool to loop a kick sample at the end of the Break-
down section, and then convert the loops into regions for individual editing.
1	
On the Big Beat track (track 7), zoom in on the small region at bar 44.
The Kick region is exactly one eighth note long, so looping the region will repeat the 
kick on every eighth note.
2	
Place the mouse pointer at the upper left of the Kick region to choose the Loop tool, 
and drag to 44 3 3 1, for a total of five repetitions.
Let’s convert those loops to regions.

348    Editing an Arrangement
3	
Control-click the Kick loops, and from the shortcut menu, choose Convert > Convert 
Loops to Regions.
The loops are replaced by individual regions; but because they are all selected, resiz-
ing one of them would resize all of them by the same amount.
4	
Click the workspace background to deselect all regions.
5	
Resize the first Kick region to about half its size.
6	
Resize the three following kicks in ascending lengths, leaving the last one (Kick.4) 
unchanged.

Double-click the lower half of the ruler (above the Marker track) to start playback a 
little before the first kick at bar 44.
The five kicks on the Big Beat track punctuate the Breakdown section with authority, 
announcing the new Big Beat rhythm in the Outro section.
 To continue playback past the right edge of the workspace without the need 
to update the workspace to follow the playhead, in the Tracks area menu bar, click the 
Catch button to turn it off. The Catch button is automatically turned back on when 
you locate the playhead or start playback, and turned off when you zoom or scroll 
horizontally.

Click the background, and press Z to zoom out.
By converting loops to regions, you can start arranging using the simplicity of the Loop 
tool, and complete your arrangement by leveraging the flexibility of individual regions.
Using Folders to Determine the Length of a Loop
In Logic, folders are regions that can contain other regions. Folders are a powerful 
arrangement tool, because when you pack regions into a folder, you can edit that folder as 
a single region, and the regions inside the folder will be edited accordingly.
When you loop a region in the workspace, the length of the region determines the length 
of the loop. If you wanted to loop a drum sample on every beat, but the sample’s audio 
region was shorter than one beat, you could first pack the region into a folder that can 
then be resized to any length and looped. Then, the length of the folder determines the 
length of the loop.
In this exercise, you’ll pack the sample on the Big Kick track (track 1) into a folder to loop 
it on every beat throughout the A1 and B1 sections.
1	
Control-Option-drag around the two kick drum samples at the beginning of the A1 
section.

350    Editing an Arrangement
The Big Kick region is less than a beat long, and if you looped it now, the loops 
wouldn’t be in sync with the grid.
2	
Click the Big Kick region at bar 4 to select it.
3	
In the Tracks area menu bar, choose Functions > Folder > Pack Folder.
 You can use folders to pack multiple regions on the same track or on multiple 
tracks.
The region is packed into a folder that is one bar long. Looping it now would repeat 
the kick on every bar. Let’s resize the folder to repeat the kick on every beat.
4	
Position the mouse pointer at the lower-right corner of the folder, and shorten the 
folder length to one beat (0 1 0 0).

region. In the ruler, two markers show the folder’s beginning (bar 4 beat 1) and end 
(bar 4 beat 2).

8	
In the Region inspector, select the Loop checkbox (or press L) to loop the selected 
region.
The region loops, and the loops stop where the next region on the track begins (at the 
beginning of the A2 section).
9	
Listen to the A1 and B1 sections.
The Big Kick sample now plays every beat in those sections, making the kick drum 
sound fuller overall. You will repeat the kick drum sample on track 2 to complete the 
layered kick drum sound.
Cloning Audio Regions
Clones are regions that refer to the original region from which they were created. Resiz-
ing the original region or any of its clones resizes them all equally. Clones are very helpful 
when you are arranging regions you may have to later resize simultaneously.
You will now place clones of the kick drum sample on track 2 on every beat to fill the A1 
and B1 sections, and later shorten the original and all of its clones in a single operation to 
adjust the kick drum’s sustain.
1	
On track 2, select the kick drum sample at the beginning of the A1 section.
You were introduced to the Repeat Regions/Events dialog in Lesson 6 when repeat-
ing MIDI notes in the Piano Roll. You will now use the same dialog to create multiple 
clones from the selected audio region.
2	
Choose Edit > Repeat (or press Command-R).
www.ebook3000.com

Copying Material to Fill in Parts    353
3	
In the Repeat Regions/Events dialog, use the following settings:
▶
▶Number of Copies = 63
▶
▶Adjustment = Beat
▶
▶As = Aliases or Clones
NOTE ▶ ​When you select “Aliases or Clones,” the type of region selected in the work-
space determines the result: MIDI regions create aliases, and audio regions create 
clones. An alias doesn’t contain any MIDI data of its own and always plays the MIDI 
data contained in the source region.
 To create a single alias or clone, Shift-Option-drag a MIDI or audio region.
4	
Click OK.
Logic creates 63 clones of the original region placed on every beat in sections A1 and B1.
5	
Listen to the A1 section.
You may now be able to hear a faint low-frequency sound throughout the section.
6	
Solo the Sub Kick track (track 2), and listen to the A1 section again.
Each kick drum is sustained until the next one hits, which creates a low-frequency 
drone. Let’s shorten the samples so you can clearly distinguish between each kick 
drum sound.

354    Editing an Arrangement
7	
Zoom in on the first few regions in the A1 section of the Sub Kick track (track 2).
The regions are connected, and you see the sustain tail of each kick end where the 
next kick starts.
8	
Resize the first region to shorten it slightly.
The original region and all its clones are resized by the same amount, which places 
silence between all the kick drum samples.
9	
Listen to the Sub Kick track in the A1 section.
You can now hear silence between the kick drums on that track, and you no longer 
hear the low-frequency sound. However, the ends of the Sub Kick regions now click, a 
problem you will resolve using fade-outs.

Adding Batch Fades
Editing multiple regions can result in click sounds at each edit point. To remove the click 
sounds, you can easily apply the same fade to multiple selected regions using the Region 
inspector.
The first step is to select all the regions you want to fade. Selecting many small regions 
can be challenging: Zoom in and you won’t see them all, zoom out and you may have dif-
ficulty distinguishing what is and isn’t selected. Fortunately, you can use the locators to 
precisely determine which regions are selected.
1	
Control-Option-click the workspace to zoom out.
You could drag to select all the Sub Kick regions in the A1 and B1 sections. However, 
the regions are so small you might not be sure that you selected the last B1 region 
without selecting the first region in the next section.
In Logic, clicking a track header selects all the regions on that track. However, when 
Cycle mode is turned on, only those regions within the locators are selected.
2	
Drag a cycle area corresponding to the A1 and B1 sections (from 4 1 1 1 to 20 1 1 1).
3	
Click the Sub Kick track header (track 2) to select all the Sub Kick regions within the 
locators.
You can now use the Region inspector to batch apply fade-outs.

In the Region inspector, double-click to the right of the Fade Out parameter to acti-
vate the data field.
5	
Enter 100 (ms).
A 100 ms fade-out is added to the end of each selected region.

Zoom in on a few regions on the Sub Kick track to see the fade-outs placed on those 
regions.

Listen to the result.
You can now hear the boomy sub kick sample on every beat, but with a shortened 
sustain tail, and without click sounds at the end of each sample.

10	 In the control bar, click the Cycle button (or press C) to turn off Cycle mode.
11	 Listen to the beginning of the song. In the A1 and B1 sections, the kick now sounds 
deep and strong.
You now know several ways to copy, clone, repeat, and loop regions. You can pack regions 
of odd lengths into a folder and easily adjust its length for looping, and use batch fades to 
remove click sounds at the end of the regions.
Rendering Multiple Regions
In previous exercises, you created many loops and clones, and added fades to those cloned 
regions. When working with many small regions in the workspace, you may accidentally 
edit a region’s length, position, or fade and not notice the accidental change unless you 
zoom in closer. To avoid this error, you can render several regions and their fades into a 
single new audio file.
1	
Make sure the Sub Kick regions in sections A1 and B1 on track 2 are still selected.
2	
Choose Edit > Join > Regions (or press Command-J).
A dialog opens asking you to confirm the creation of a new audio file.
3	
Click Create. On the track, all the selected Sub Kick regions are replaced by a long 
Sub Kick audio region that spans the A1 and B1 sections.
On the Big Kick track, a folder region loops throughout the two sections. You will 
bounce that section in place to create a new audio file on a new track, and then drag 
it back to the existing track.
4	
Click the Big Kick region or one of its loops in the A1 or B1 sections to select the 
region and all of its loops.

358    Editing an Arrangement
5	
Control-click the looped region, and choose Bounce and Join > Bounce in Place (or 
press Control-B) to open the Bounce Regions In Place dialog.
This dialog includes multiple options to determine whether to bounce with or with-
out the effect plug-ins, and how to manage the source material.
6	
In the Name field, enter Big Kick.
7	
Set Source to Delete.
The current selection will automatically be deleted after the new audio file is created. 
You will be dragging the new audio file back to the Big Kick track, so you need to 
ensure that the new file remains unprocessed by the plug-ins, the Volume fader, and 
the Pan knob.
8	
Select Bypass Effect Plug-ins.
Now the selected regions will not be processed by the plug-ins on the Big Kick chan-
nel strip to create the new audio file.
9	
Deselect Include Volume/Pan Automation.
Doing so ensures that the bounced audio will not be processed by the Volume fader 
and Pan knob on the channel strip.
Normalize automatically adjusts the level of an audio file so that it peaks at or below 0 
dBFS. However, in this case you want to retain the original level of the sample.

11	 Click OK.
A new sixteen-bar Big Kick audio region appears on a new Big Kick track (track 2). 
Let’s move that region back to the original Big Kick track (track 1).
12	 Drag the Big Kick region on track 2 to track 1.
Because track 2 is now empty, you can delete it.

Artists often become so involved in the creative process that they may not see the big 
picture when developing an ideal structure for their song. Producers and A&R representa-
tives may suggest adding an introduction, making the chorus come in earlier, or shorten-
ing the song so its length is more suitable for radio play. Sometimes a shorter radio mix 
will be produced along with a longer mix for the album.
In the following exercises, you will save an alternative arrangement, insert one new sec-
tion, and cut another to make the song more exciting.
Saving an Alternative Arrangement
Saving alternative versions can allow you to freely explore creative tangents while remain-
ing able to return to previous versions of the project. In Logic, a project’s alternatives are 
saved within the project file, itself. When the project is open, you can switch between dif-
ferent alternatives in the File menu.
Let’s create a new alternative for your song, and rename the two alternatives. Later you’ll 
continue editing the new alternative, and at the end of this lesson you’ll go back to the 
current alternative.
1	
Choose File > Save (or press Command-S).
All the edits you’ve performed to this point are now saved in the current project file, 
Raise It Up.
2	
Choose File > Alternatives > New Alternative.
The “Save as new Alternative” dialog opens. Because you later will create a second 
break section, let’s call this new alternative “Two Breaks.”
3	
In the New Alternative Name field, enter Two Breaks, and click OK.
In the title bar, the new alternative’s name (Two Breaks) appears next to the project name 
(Raise It Up).
www.ebook3000.com

Adding and Deleting Sections    361
Let’s name the previous version you saved at the beginning of this exercise.
4	
Choose File > Alternatives > Edit Alternatives.
The Edit Alternatives window opens, listing all the alternatives created for the current 
project, and the dates when they were saved. Buttons allow you to rename or remove 
selected alternatives.
5	
Double-click the first line below the Alternative Name header, rename the first alter-
native Original, and click Done.
You now have two alternatives of the same project. You saved Original at the beginning 
of this exercise, and you are currently working on the new alternative, Two Breaks.
Adding a Section
A good arrangement carefully balances new elements to keep listeners excited with repeat-
ing sections that return listeners to familiar territory and inspire them to hum along or 
dance. Adding a short pause before going back to a familiar section creates a suspension 
in time that surprises listeners and reclaims attention.
In this exercise, you will insert one bar of silence between the B1 and A2 sections, and use 
existing material in the song to populate that new break. In Logic, the position and length 
of the cycle area determine where the new section will be inserted and how long it will be.
1	
Listen to the transition from the B1 section to the A2 section.
You can hear the vocals from the end of the B1 section (“yeah”) overlap the vocals at 
the beginning of the A2 section (“I was”). When vocals from two consecutive sections 

362    Editing an Arrangement
overlap, adding a break or a pause between the two sections gives them space, as if 
you allowed the singer to breathe between two phrases.
Alignment guides are currently turned on in this project. If you tried to drag a cycle 
area in the A2 section, Logic would snap to the beginning and end of all the small 
regions in tracks 1 and 2, which would make it challenging to drag the cycle area that 
you want. Let’s turn off the alignment guides.
2	
In the Tracks area menu bar, choose Edit > Alignment Guides to turn them off.
3	
In the upper half of the ruler, drag a one-bar cycle at bar 20.
4	
Choose Edit > Cut/Insert Time > Insert Silence at Locators (or press 
Control-Command-Z).
All the regions are divided at bar 20. The regions to the right of bar 20 are selected 
and moved one bar to the right, leaving an empty bar below the cycle area.
You will copy the first region in the Banjo 1 track to this new break section. That 
region doesn’t start on a downbeat, so let’s enable snapping to make sure that the copy 
has the same position relative to the bar as the original.
5	
In the Tracks area menu bar, click the Snap pop-up menu, and make sure “Snap 
Regions to Relative Values” is selected.

Adding and Deleting Sections    363
6	
From the Snap pop-up menu, choose Bar.
7	
In the Banjo 1 track (track 10), hold down the mouse button over the first region, 
Intro Banjo.
The help tag displays the position of the region (1 4 4 187).
8	
Option-drag the Intro Banjo region to 19 4 4 187.
As you drag the region, it snaps to the same relative position in every bar (1 4 4 187, 
then 2 4 4 187, and so on), making for easy positioning without losing the timing of 
the performance in reference to the grid.
9	
When you release the mouse button, an alert asks if you want to copy the track auto-
mation along with the region.
Remember when you listened to the banjo in Solo mode at the beginning of this les-
son? You noticed that the EQ was automated, which gave the banjo a thinner sound 

364    Editing an Arrangement
during the intro. That same thinner sound would work great for this break, so let’s 
copy the automation along with the region.
10	 Click Copy.
Now let’s add a tom fill to this new break section.
11	 On the Tom Fills track (track 5), hold down the mouse button in the region just 
before bar 25.
The help tag displays a position of 24 3 1 1, indicating that the region starts in the 
middle of bar 24. Snapping will ensure that you can drag the region only to the mid-
dle of a bar.
12	 Option-drag the Tom Fills region to 20 3 1 1.
An alert asks you if you also want to copy the automation.
13	 Click Copy to copy the automation with the region.
14	 In the ruler, click the cycle area to turn off Cycle mode.
www.ebook3000.com

Adding and Deleting Sections    365
15	 Listen to the new break.
It sounds good, but there’s an issue with the vocal at the beginning of the A2 sec-
tion. The vocals actually started a bit before the beginning of the A2 section, so they 
were divided when you inserted a bar of silence. Now the beginning of the sentence 
(“I was”) is sung before the break, and the rest of the sentence is sung after the break 
(“under the ground”).
16	 Zoom in on the Lead Vox track (track 19) so you can comfortably see the small 
region at the end of the B1 section and the beginning of the Lead Vox region in the 
A2 section.
17	 At the end of the B1 section (the end of bar 19), select the small Lead Vox region, and 
press Delete to remove it. 
An alert asks you if you want to erase the automation at the region location.
18	 In the alert, click Erase.
The Lead Vox region at the beginning of the A2 section is now missing the beginning 
of the sentence (“I was”). However, the region still references the original audio file, 
so resizing the region from the left will recover the part that was cut.
Because you will need to drag with more precision, you will set the Snap mode back 
to Smart.
19	 In the Tracks area menu bar, from the Snap pop-up menu, choose Smart.

366    Editing an Arrangement
20	 Position the mouse pointer on the lower-right corner of the Lead Vox region at the 
beginning of the A2 section, and drag to the left to 20 4 1 1.
21	 Zoom out and listen to your new break section by starting playback at the beginning 
of the song. At bar 20, you may hear clicks at the end of some audio regions. Feel free 
to zoom in and add fade-outs to remove the clicks.
The song has a two-bar intro, then plays two different eight-bar sections (A1 and B1). 
At the end of the B1 section, you can clearly hear the “yeah” on the vocals because no 
other vocals overlap them. Instead of the expected return to an A section, you get a 
one-bar break where most instruments pause. The thin banjo sound and the tom fill 
are just enough material to capture attention, and the beginning of the new sentence 
(“I was”) at the end of the break pulls the listener into the next A2 section.
Cutting a Section
If adding a section can increase excitement, cutting part or all of a section can be equally 
effective to sustain the song’s flow and energy. While arranging the song, you may not 
realize that a section is too long. Later in the process, as the song approaches completion, 
you can experiment by skipping parts of the song, and cutting a part when you decide the 
song works better without it.
You will now skip areas of your song using the locators, and remove part of a section. 
First, let’s skip over the Breakdown section.
1	
Play the song from around bar 35 to around bar 49.
www.ebook3000.com

Adding and Deleting Sections    367
The song comes out of the B2 section into a two-bar Break section, then a seven-bar 
Breakdown section introduces new backup vocals that continue during the Outro. 
Let’s listen to the song without that Breakdown section.
2	
In the Marker track, drag the Breakdown marker to the ruler.
Cycle mode is on, and the cycle area matches the marker. To turn the cycle area into a 
skip cycle area, you have to swap the left and right locators.
3	
In the ruler, Control-click the cycle area, and choose “Swap Left and Right Locator.” 
The cycle area is replaced by a skip cycle area.
Let’s play the song without the Breakdown section.
4	
Listen to the song by starting playback a couple of bars before the Break.
When the playhead reaches the end of the Break, it jumps to the Outro, thereby skip-
ping the Breakdown section.
Now that it’s omitted, the breath of fresh air that the Breakdown section created is 
also missing. Instead, let’s try skipping the Break section.
5	
Move the skip cycle area to bar 37, and resize it to two bars to match the Break marker.

368    Editing an Arrangement
6	
Start playback a few bars before the Break marker.
The transition between the B2 section and the Breakdown section is too abrupt. Let’s 
skip only half of the Break section.
7	
Stop playback, and resize the skip cycle area to one bar long so that it skips bar 37.
8	
Start playback a few bars before the Break marker.
The timing is better. The break sounds empty now, but you can later add a section of 
bass. Let’s cut the section below the skip cycle area.
9	
Stop playback, and choose Edit > Cut/Insert Time > Cut Section Between Locators 
(or press Control-Command-X).
The section below the skip cycle area is cut, and all the regions that were previously to 
the right of the skip cycle area move one bar to the left to fill the void. Let’s bring back 
the bass section from the cut first half of the Break section.
10	 Zoom in on the bass below the skip cycle.

In the Tracks area menu bar, the Drag mode is set to No Overlap. In that mode, 
regions are automatically resized to ensure that they never overlap as the result of an 
edit. You will now lengthen the already-long E Bass.5 region.
11	 Drag the lower-right corner of the E Bass.5 region to the right, over the short E Bass.8 
region, ending it a little past the end of the skip cycle.
The short E Bass.8 region is removed.
Note that Cycle mode is still on. You’ll have to turn it off if you don’t want the play-
head skipping the new one-bar break.
12	 Click the skip cycle area to turn it off.
13	 Zoom out, and listen to the new break.
The break now sounds perfect. The bass plays a fill, and the banjo, percussions, and 
keyboard (Wurli) play the last three eighth notes before the Breakdown section.

Cutting Regions to Remove Silence or Noise
When you are recording musicians who sing or play in only parts of your song, you may 
end up with long audio regions that have silence or noise between their performances. 
Cutting those silent or noisy sections cleans up your project, and produces individual 
audio regions for each part of their performance, so you can arrange and rearrange those 
parts more easily.
Muting or Deleting Marquee Selections
You can use the Marquee tool to select those sections between the performances, and then 
apply key commands to delete or mute them.
1	
In the Nana 1 track header (track 24), click the Solo button.
In the workspace, all the regions on other tracks are dimmed, so you can easily see 
which track is soloed.
2	
Click the Nana 1.1 region to select it, press C to enable Cycle mode, and press Com-
mand-U (Set Locators by Regions/Events/Marquee).
The cycle area matches the position and length of the Nana 1.1 region.
3	
Zoom in on the beginning of the Nana 1.1 region.
On the waveform, you clearly see where the vocalists are singing. When they’re silent, 
the waveform is flat. But if you look close enough it’s not completely flat, which indi-
cates that you may have unwanted noise in the recording.
www.ebook3000.com

Cutting Regions to Remove Silence or Noise    371
4	
Listen to the soloed track until bar 42.
When the vocalists are not singing in bars 40 and 41, their headphone mix bleeds 
through their microphone. Let’s remove that unwanted section using the Marquee 
tool, which is your Command-click tool.
5	
Command-drag over the flat section of the waveform in bars 40 and 41.
6	
Press Delete.
The marquee selection is cut, leaving you two regions on the track.
7	
Listen to the result and note that you no longer hear extraneous sound in bars 40 and 41.
8	
Using the same technique on the Nana 1 track, continue removing the noises between 
the singing until you reach bar 57.

372    Editing an Arrangement
9	
Listen to the last region by double-clicking the lower half of the ruler at bar 57 to start 
playback.
At the end of bar 60, the singers sing “Nah nah nah,” and then you can hear a faint 
laugh. They most likely sang that last part as a joke because it wasn’t part of the 
arrangement. When you’re not sure whether or not to remove a part, you can mute 
it. Later, if you change your mind, you can easily unmute the regions you want to 
restore.
10	 In the last region on the Nana 1 track, Command-drag starting with the flat wave-
form in bar 59 and including the little waveform near the end.
11	 Press Control-M (Mute Notes/Regions/Folders on/off).
The portion of the region you selected is divided into a new, muted region. If you 
later decide that you want to play it, you can select the region, and press Control-M to 
unmute it.
Dividing Regions by Removing Silence
In the previous exercise, you used the Marquee tool to select unwanted portions of an 
audio region, and deleted or muted the selected sections using key commands. Although

the Marquee is a powerful audio editing tool, continuing to manually edit all the Nana 
regions would be time-consuming.
To finish editing the remaining Nana regions, you will use Strip Silence, a feature that 
automatically cuts portions of an audio region that fall below a specific volume threshold.
1	
Zoom out vertically so you can see all the Nana tracks (from track 24 to track 30).
To quickly solo or mute multiple tracks in the Tracks area, you can drag an interface 
button in a track header down or up to emulate the way sound engineers mute or solo 
multiple channel strips by sliding a finger across the buttons on a mixing board.
2	
In the Nana 2 track header (track 25), drag the Solo button down to the last track 
(track 30).
Track 24 was already soloed, so now tracks 24 through 30 (all the Nana tracks) are 
soloed.
3	
Listen to the soloed tracks. You can hear noise (mostly headphones bleeding) between 
the sung sections.
Let’s apply Strip Silence to the Nana 2.1 region (on track 25).

374    Editing an Arrangement
4	
Select the Nana 2.1 region.
5	
Choose Functions > “Remove Silence from Audio Region” (or press Control-X).
The Strip Silence window opens, showing how the region will be edited. To the left of 
the waveform, a scale allows you to measure the amplitude of the waveform from 0% 
to 100%. Below the waveform, the Threshold parameter is set to 4.0%, so Strip Silence 
will remove any audio that drops below 4%.
To the right in the Strip Silence window, two small regions will be created where you’d 
prefer to create only one. This occurs because in that short section, the audio went 
below the 4% threshold for a short period. You will now increase the “Minimum Time 
to accept as Silence” value a little to ensure that Strip Silence cuts a region only when 
the audio stays under the 4% threshold for 0.5 seconds or longer.
6	
In the Strip Silence window, set the “Minimum Time to accept as Silence” to 0.5000 sec.
In the Strip Silence window, the values adjust by whole increments of the digit you 
drag. So you drag the first digit to the right of the decimal point to change the value 
from 0.1000 to 0.5000 sec.
In the Strip Silence window, the two short regions at the end are replaced by a single 
region.
www.ebook3000.com

Cutting Regions to Remove Silence or Noise    375
7	
Click OK.
On the Nana 2 track, the regions are divided so that the silence between the perfor-
mances is removed.
8	
Select the Nana 3.1 region (on track 26).
9	
Choose Functions > “Remove Silence from Audio Region” (or press Control-X).
This region has more noise than the previous one. Some of the noise is over the 4% 
threshold, and Strip Silence is about to create several regions with only noise in them 
(just before the third sung section). To avoid it, you need to raise the Threshold above 
the noise level.
10	 Drag the Threshold value up to 6.0%.
In the Strip Silence window, the two small regions containing noise disappear.
11	 Click OK.
12	 Click the Nana Low 1.1 region on track 27, and press Control-X to open the Strip 
Silence window.
One of the sung sections appears in two regions.

376    Editing an Arrangement
13	 Set the “Minimum Time to Accept as Silence” to 0.6000 sec, and click OK.
On the Nana Low 1 track (track 27), regions are created for each sung section. You 
will apply the same Strip Silence settings to the two remaining sections.
14	 Select the Nana Low 2.1 region (track 28), press Control-X to open the Strip Silence 
window, and click OK.
15	 Select the Nana Hi.1 region (track 29), press Control-X, and click OK.
All the regions on the Nana tracks were divided to remove the unwanted sounds 
between the sung parts. Working with each sung section as an individual region will 
make the editing and arranging process easier.
16	 Listen to the soloed tracks.
The sounds between the sung sections were removed, although you may hear some 
clicks at the edit points.
You will continue working on this vocal section in the next exercise, so keep the Nana 
tracks soloed.

Cutting Regions to Remove Silence or Noise    377
Arranging the Resulting Regions
Now that you have each sung section in an individual region, you can easily edit and 
arrange those sections by muting or deleting unwanted regions, copying existing regions 
where performances are missing, and replacing a bad performance with a good one.
1	
Start playback at bar 59, and listen to the end of the Outro section.
On the Nana 2 track (track 25), the last region contains the same “Nah nah nah” 
performance you muted on the Nana 1 track. Let’s mute that region.
2	
Select the last region on track 25, and press Control-M to mute it.
You will now listen to a bad performance and delete it.
3	
On the Nana Hi track (track 29), select the last Nana region (at bar 49), and in the 
control bar, click the Solo button (or press Control-S).
In the workspace, all other regions are dimmed and the selected region is shaded in 
yellow to indicate that it is soloed.
Cycle mode is still enabled, so pressing the Spacebar would start playback at the 
beginning of the Breakdown marker, several bars before the region you want to hear. 
Instead, you’ll use the “Play from Selection” key command (Shift-Spacebar).

378    Editing an Arrangement
4	
Press Shift-Spacebar to start playback at the beginning of the soloed region.
The singer goes flat on the first note, strains to hit the high pitch, laughs, and gives 
up. Let’s delete this region.
5	
Press Delete.
To replace the deleted passage, you’ll copy the first region on the Nana Hi track to bar 
49 using snapping to ensure an accurately placed copy.
6	
In the Tracks area menu bar, from the Snap pop-up menu, make sure that “Snap 
Regions to Relative Value” is selected, and choose Bar.
7	
Option-drag the first region on the Nana Hi track (track 29) to copy it to around bar 49.
The copied region snaps to 48 4 4 158, retaining the same relative position as the 
original region.
NOTE ▶ ​To ensure that the region you drag doesn’t snap to the beginning and ends 
of regions on other tracks, make sure that Alignment Guides are not selected in the 
Tracks area View menu.
8	
Copy the region twice more to 52 4 4 158 and 56 4 4 158.
9	
In the control bar, click the Solo button (or press Control-S) to turn off Solo mode.
You are done editing this project, so let’s listen to the whole song.
10	 Click the Cycle button (or press C) to turn off Cycle mode.
You will now use the “Solo off for all” key command to unsolo all the soloed tracks in 
your project.

Pay close attention to the sections you edited in this lesson. The kick drums you 
looped and repeated earlier in the A1 and B1 sections are now blending into a com-
manding, layered kick drum sound that drives the beginning of the song. At bar 20, 
the short one-bar break creates an exciting suspension that transitions into the A2 
section. The one-bar bass fill leading into the Breakdown section is just the right 
length, carrying the listener into the powerful Nana backup vocals throughout the 
Breakdown and Outro sections.
You saved different project alternatives before you started editing the arrangement, so 
you can now go back to your original alternative.
14	 Choose File > Save (or press Command-S).
15	 Choose File > Alternatives > Original.
The current alternative closes, and the older version of the song opens. Note the 
absence of the break at bar 20, the two-bar break at bar 36, and the unedited Nana 
regions at the bottom right of the workspace.
Remember that a successful arrangement balances repeated elements and new elements. 
Repeating melodies and grooves gives the listener a chance to become familiar with the 
song, sometimes to the point of singing along or dancing. Adding small breaks to the 
arrangement suspends time in the flow of the song, and helps renew interest.
As you produce more music, you will become increasingly adept at determining what 
makes a good arrangement. Try to analyze the arrangements of the songs you love, and 
incorporate some of those ideas into your own compositions.

Mixing is the art of blending all the instruments and sounds into a 
sound field. A good mix can make the difference between an amateur 
demo track and a professional production. Mixing should carefully bal-
ance two goals: blending all the elements into a cohesive whole, and at 
the same time, keeping them sufficiently defined so that listeners can 
distinguish among them. In other words, make the musicians sound 
as if they are playing in the same room, while ensuring that they don’t 
mask each other and muddy the mix. A good mix is like a completed 
puzzle, in which all the pieces (all the instruments) fill their proper 
places in the sound field without overlapping.
With those goals in mind, you can adjust four parameters of an instru-
ment to define its space in the sound field. You can adjust the instru-
ment’s volume, its lateral position in the sound field, its distance, and its 
frequency spectrum. Those parameters are interrelated, and changing 
one often means that you will need to readjust the others.
When mixing, it’s also fundamental to be faithful to the genre of the song. 
In Lesson 7, you worked with a song (Little Lady) that had a rather dry 
mix because the indie rock song genre didn’t call for many effects, and you 
wanted to stay close to the raw live performance sound of a rock band.
Mixing
Lesson 9

386    Mixing
You will work with an indie folk song in the context of a modern pop production that will 
benefit from a variety of processing effects. A more complex arrangement with more lay-
ered instruments also means that you must pay more attention to each instrument’s place 
in the mix. While Logic allows you to mix in various surround formats such as Quadro-
phonic, 5.1, or even 7.1, you’ll focus on stereophonic mixing in this lesson.
Organizing Windows and Tracks
A little organization can go a long way toward making your mixing session more produc-
tive. It can save time by minimizing the need to constantly open and close panes, or zoom 
and scroll the workspace to locate tracks or navigate the song. The more you streamline 
your workflow, the easier it will be for you to focus on finding a place in the mix for each 
specific sound or instrument.
Using Track Stacks to Streamline the Workspace
As you build an arrangement, you may find yourself layering multiple instruments to 
get a fuller sound. Modern pop productions also often use short sound effects in strate-
gic positions in the song that add ear candy and help renew excitement throughout the 
arrangement. As the track count increases, the Tracks area becomes bloated, making it 
increasingly more difficult to find the tracks you want to adjust.
In Logic, Track Stacks allow you to display a group of tracks as a single track in the Tracks 
area. The stack can be opened when you need to access individual tracks. In the next 
exercise, you will create a folder stack for all the drums and percussion tracks in the song, 
freeing the Tracks area of the tracks that don’t need further work.
1	
Open Logic Pro X Files > Lessons > 09 BIG.
2	
Listen to the song.
The mix sounds good, but a few instruments need work. Feel free to solo some of the 
tracks to listen to them in isolation. The electric guitar on the E Guit Hi track (track 
25) sounds dry. Adding a guitar amplifier modeling plug-in will give it character. 
Using a tremolo plug-in to process the acoustic guitars on tracks 16 and 17 will add a 
bouncy groove to the Interlude section at bar 29.
Later, you’ll mix the vocals (tracks 27 through 31) by adjusting their pans, levels, and 
EQ settings; and adding delay and reverberation.

Organizing Windows and Tracks    387
The drums and percussion tracks on tracks 1 through 9 are fully mixed and don’t 
need further attention, so you will now create a track stack for them.
3	
Make sure the Kick track (track 1) is selected.
4	
Shift-click the Percussions track (track 9) to select tracks 1 through 9.
5	
Choose Track > Create Track Stack (or press Command-Shift-D).
In the Track Stack dialog, you can choose between a folder stack and a summing 
stack. Let’s learn the difference.
6	
Make sure Summing Stack is selected, and click the disclosure triangle next to Details.
You used a summing stack in Lesson 5 to create a layered synth patch. In a summing 
stack, all the subtracks are routed to the main track’s auxiliary channel strip where 
their submix can be further processed by plug-ins and then routed as desired. In this 

388    Mixing
case, however, there’s no need to further process the drums and percussions, and a 
folder stack is the tool for the job.
7	
In the Track Stack dialog, select Folder Stack.
Folder stacks do not affect the routing of the subtracks, which makes them the right 
choice for organizing tracks that don’t need to be submixed.
8	
Click Create.
All the selected tracks are placed into a Track Stack on track 1. The Tracks area is 
streamlined, which will make it easier to find your way around the remaining tracks. 
In the Inspector, note that the Track Stack’s main track channel strip (to the left) 
shows a Volume fader and Mute and Solo buttons, but has no Audio FX slot. The sub-
tracks inside the folder stack are still routed directly to the Output channel strip, and 
no audio signal goes through the main track’s channel strip.

Organizing Windows and Tracks    389
Let’s rename this track stack.
9	
On the folder stack track header (track 1), double-click the track stack name, and 
enter Drums+Percu.
When working with very high track counts, consider creating track stacks for groups of 
instruments (such as drums, guitars, keyboards, and vocals) to streamline your workspace.
Using Screensets to Switch Between the Tracks Area and the Mixer
When first exploring the mixing process in Lesson 1, you may have noticed how much of 
a challenge navigating the workspace can be when the Mixer pane is open at the bottom 
of the workspace. In this lesson, you will use two screensets to save different window lay-
outs. One screenset will display your main window, and the other will include your Mixer. 
As you work on the mix, you can recall each of these screensets using key commands.
Let’s create the two screensets and study their behaviors.
1	
At the top of your screen, look at the main menu bar.
Screenset menu
The Screenset menu displays the number of the current screenset (1).
2	
Click the Screenset menu to open it.
The menu lists only one screenset, with a default name in parentheses, Screenset 1 
(Tracks). Let’s create a new one.

390    Mixing
3	
Press 2.
NOTE ▶ ​If you use an extended keyboard with a numeric keypad, make sure that you 
press the 2 key on the alphanumeric keypad. You can use the numerical keypad to go 
to the markers in the Marker track.
A new screenset is created with a main window of a different size and zoom level 
from screenset 1.
4	
Choose Window > Open Mixer (or press Command-2).
A Mixer window opens on top of the main window. You won’t need the main window 
in screenset 2, so you can close it.
5	
Click the main window beneath the Mixer window to bring it to the top, and press 
Command-W to close it.
Let’s make the Mixer window bigger.
6	
At the left of the Mixer window title bar, click the window zoom button.
Window zoom button
The Mixer window occupies the full width of the screen.

Organizing Windows and Tracks    391
7	
Click the Screenset menu.
The menu lists the two screensets with an appropriate default name for each.
8	
From the Screenset menu, choose Screenset 1 (Tracks), or press 1.
Screenset 1 is recalled, and you can see the main window.
By default, screensets are unlocked. You can open multiple windows, adjust their 
sizes and positions, open the desired panes, choose different tools, and so on, and the 
screenset will memorize your layout.
9	
Make sure that no regions are selected, and press Z to zoom in on the regions so that 
they occupy the entire workspace. If necessary, scroll to adjust the display as desired.
10	 Press 2 to recall screenset 2, and press 1 to recall screenset 1.
Screenset 1 is recalled with the zoom and scroll adjustments you made in step 9.
When you’re happy with the arrangement of a screenset, you can lock it to make sure 
that it always returns in that state.
11	 From the Screenset menu, choose Lock.
Locked screenset
A dot appears next to the Screenset menu to indicate that the current screenset is 
locked. Let’s observe the behavior of a locked screenset.
12	 Zoom in on a region, change the tools in your tool menus, open some panes such as a 
Browser and an editor, and open some windows from the Window menu.
13	 Press 1 to recall screenset 1.
The screenset is recalled in the state it was when you locked it, and all the changes 
you made in step 12 are lost.

392    Mixing
14	 Press 2 to recall screenset 2.
15	 From the Screenset menu, choose Lock to lock screenset 2.
You have adjusted the layout of two screensets to easily switch between the main window 
and the Mixer window using the number keys. You’ve also locked those screensets, which 
gives you a quick way to recall them in their current states.
Customizing a Locked Screenset
In the previous exercise, you observed that locked screensets are always recalled in the 
state in which you locked them. When you want to customize a screenset that was previ-
ously locked, you can unlock it, apply the desired changes, and lock it again.
You will now customize the Mixer window in screenset 2 to display only the tools you 
need in this lesson.
1	
Make sure you are in screenset 2 (the Mixer window), and from the Screenset menu, 
choose Unlock. 
After making a decision during a mixing session, locating the components you need 
on the correct channel strip in the Mixer can be frustrating. By default, the channel 
strips in the Mixer window show you nearly all the available channel strip compo-
nents. Because you won’t need to access channel strip settings, you can hide the Set-
ting buttons at the top of the channel strips.
2	
In the Mixer window, choose View > Channel Strip Components > Setting Menu to 
deselect it.
At the top of the channel strips, the Setting buttons disappear.
3	
Using the same method, hide the MIDI effects, Group, and Automation areas.

Organizing Windows and Tracks    393
You can display track numbers on channel strips to make identifying them easier.
4	
In the Mixer window, choose View > Channel Strip Components > Track Number to 
select it.
Track numbers appear below the track names.
Some of the track, plug-in, and output names are abbreviated to fit the narrow chan-
nel strips. For example, the track name on the first channel strip on the left is dis-
played as “Dru…Percu,” and the Output slot of most channel strips is displayed as “St 
Out.” You can choose to view wide channel strips, which are easier on the eyes and 
avoid name abbreviations.
5	
In the Mixer, click the Wide Channel Strips button.
Wide Channel Strips button
Narrow Channel Strips button

394    Mixing
The channel strips grow wider. The first channel strip now displays the full track name, 
“Drums+Percu,” and the outputs of most channel strips now display “Stereo Out.”
To avoid any further changes to this screenset, let’s lock it again.
6	
From the Screenset menu, choose Lock to lock screenset 2.
7	
Press 1 to recall screenset 1.
You took the time to get rid of the clutter in the Mixer, which will reward you later when you 
have to quickly identify channel strips, see where they are routed, and adjust their settings.
Using the Amp Designer
You can use audio effect plug-ins to sculpt sound and give it character, and help the vari-
ous parts find their places in the mix. These plug-ins will also give those parts a different 
timbre, and later, influence how you adjust their levels or EQ (equalization).
The Amp Designer is a plug-in that emulates the sound of a guitar amp, its speaker cabi-
net, and the microphone used to record it. The plug-in simulates several amp models 
from famous vintage to modern guitar amps, and produces sounds ranging from clean to 
devastating high-gain distortion, with every nuance in-between.
Inserting a Plug-in at a Specific Point in the Signal Flow
When processing an instrument with multiple plug-ins, the order of the plug-ins influ-
ences the resulting sound. A guitar that is EQ’ed then distorted will not sound the same as 
a guitar that is distorted then EQ’ed.
In this song, the electric guitar on track 26 was recorded direct without using a guitar 
amp. To start your mix, you’ll apply the Amp Designer plug-in to give the guitar a vintage 
low-gain distortion tone. A couple of plug-ins were already placed on the guitar channel 
strip, and you will insert the Amp Designer before those two plug-ins so that the guitar is 
distorted first by the amp and then processed by the other plug-ins.
1	
In the Marker track, drag the CH2 marker to the ruler.
Cycle mode is turned on, and the cycle area corresponds to the CH2 marker where 
the E Guit Hi (track 26) plays for the first time in the song.

Using the Amp Designer    395
2	
Press the Spacebar to start playback.
The guitar plays a staccato rhythm with short, clean-sounding chords on every beat.
3	
Select the E Guit Hi track (track 26), and click its Solo button (or press S) to hear it 
independently.
The guitar has the really clean and dry sound typical of direct guitar recordings.
In the Inspector, look at the E Guit Hi channel strip. Two plug-ins (a Compressor and 
a Channel EQ) are in the audio FX section. At the top of the channel strip, the EQ 
display shows the rather drastic EQ curve of the Channel EQ plug-in. That EQ will 
later help give the guitar its place in the mix, but let’s turn it off for now, so that you 
can clearly hear the effect of the Amp Designer.
4	
Place the mouse pointer over the Channel EQ plug-in slot, and click the power button 
that appears to the left.
The frequency range of the guitar is extended. It sounds fuller, but still clean and dry. 
On the channel strip, the EQ display is dimmed to indicate that the Channel EQ plug-
in is turned off.
Let’s insert an Amp Designer plug-in before the Compressor.
5	
Place the Pointer tool at the top of the Compressor plug-in so that you see a white line 
above the plug-in.

396    Mixing
The white line indicates where the plug-in will be inserted in the signal flow of the 
channel strip.
6	
Click the white line, and choose Amps & Pedals > Amp Designer.
The Amp Designer plug-in opens. On the channel strip, the Amp Designer plug-in 
(Amp) is inserted at the top of the Audio FX section, which means that the dry guitar 
sound on the track will be processed by the Amp Designer, then by the Compressor, 
and finally by the Channel EQ (after you turn it back on).
In the Amp Designer graphic interface, you can see the amp and its parameters (Gain, 
EQ, Reverb, and so on), and to the right, the cabinet and the microphone. At the bot-
tom, pop-up menus allow you to choose a model, and to customize the model by 
selecting the desired amp, cabinet, and microphone.
 Press V to hide or show all open plug-in windows.
The guitar tone now has the character of a guitar plugged into an amp, and you can 
hear the amp’s reverb.
7	
Press the Spacebar to stop playback.
www.ebook3000.com

Using the Amp Designer    397
Inserting an Amp Designer plug-in on your dry guitar track produces a sound that is very 
close to the sound of a mic’ed guitar amp cabinet. The modeled amp gives you the sound 
you want (and great flexibility) without the hassle of dealing with high acoustic sound levels.
Customizing an Amp Model
A great way to personalize the sound of a guitar amp is to pair it with a specific guitar 
cabinet and microphone. To further customize the amp, you can change the amp’s EQ and 
Reverb types, and adjust the position of the microphone in front of the cabinet.
Throughout this exercise, take time to experiment with various models, and tweak the 
amp knobs to get a feel for the many sounds that the Amp Designer can produce. As you 
customize and fine-tune your guitar amp, don’t forget to unsolo the guitar occasionally to 
hear how your changes affect the perception of the guitar within the entire mix.
1	
Press the Spacebar to start playback.
The amp gives the guitar a clean sound. Let’s raise the gain to get a crunchier distor-
tion sound.
2	
On the amp, turn the Gain knob all the way up.
The guitar has a nice crunchy distortion. Let’s try another color of reverb.
3	
From the Reverb pop-up menu, choose Boutique Spring.
Reverb pop-up menu
The reverb has the biting high-frequency sound typical of the spring reverb units 
found on some vintage guitar amps. The guitar sound has a lot of reverberation, 
which makes it seem far away. Let’s bring the guitar forward a little more.

398    Mixing
4	
Turn down the Level knob to a position between 8 and 9 o’ clock.
The volume of the reverb lowers, and it now sounds as if the guitar moves a little closer.
If you are listening on speakers that have an extended frequency range, or on head-
phones, you may hear a low rumble coming from the guitar amp. At the bottom of 
the speaker cabinet, look at the Mic pop-up menu. The current microphone, a ribbon 
mic, has an extended range of frequencies that captures all the low-frequency content 
coming from the cabinet. A ribbon mic is a good choice when you’re looking for a 
fuller sound. However, in this busy mix, a full guitar sound would have to fight for 
attention with the other instruments in the arrangement. A more focused sound will 
help the guitar find its place in the frequency spectrum of the mix without masking 
the other instruments.
5	
From the Mic pop-up menu, choose Dynamic 57.
The low rumble is tamed, and the guitar has a sharper sound that more easily cuts 
through the mix.
At the bottom of the Amp Designer, look at the Model, Amp, and Cabinet pop-up 
menus. The British Combo model is a combination of a British amp and a British 
2x12 cabinet. To create your own hybrid guitar amp model, you’ll choose another 
cabinet.
6	
From the Cabinet pop-up menu, choose Vintage British 4x12.
The guitar sound becomes a little less aggressive.
www.ebook3000.com

Using the Amp Designer    399
You can now further sculpt the sound of the guitar by carefully positioning the micro-
phone in front of the speaker.
7	
Place the mouse pointer over the speaker cabinet.
A graphic appears that displays the position of the microphone in front of the speaker 
(represented as a white dot).
8	
Drag the white dot over the graphic while listening to its effect on the guitar sound.
The mic position strongly influences which cabinet-generated frequencies are picked 
up by the mic. When the mic is aligned with the center axis of the speaker, you hear 
the maximum level of high frequencies, and the guitar sounds brighter and more 
present. Moving the mic off-axis tends to scoop the frequency spectrum, lowering the 
mids and emphasizing the lows.
Try to place your mic slightly off the speaker’s axis and not too close to the speaker, as 
seen in the previous figure.
 When you have chosen a speaker cabinet and a mic, and positioned the 
microphone, you can click the disclosure triangle in front of the Mic menu to work 
with a smaller Amp Designer window.

400    Mixing
You will now adjust the EQ to give the guitar a more focused sound with less low and 
high frequencies and more mid-range frequencies.
9	
In the EQ section, turn down the Bass and Treble knobs, and turn up the Mids knob 
to the positions shown in the following figure.
The guitar sound is slightly more rounded and focused, though still quite aggressive. 
You can tame its brightness with the Presence knob.
10	 Option-click the Presence knob.
The Presence knob jumps to its middle position (12 o’clock), and the sound loses 
some of its aggressive bite.
There are two stages of distortion in the Amp Designer. Previously, you used the Gain 
knob to adjust the level of distortion introduced by the preamp stage. You will now 
adjust the Master knob to reduce the saturation introduced by the power amp.
11	 Drag the Master knob to 1 o’clock.
While the guitar still has the nice crunch created by the gain in the preamp stage, it has 
less of the power amp stage saturation and sounds clearer. Turning down the Master 
knob also turns down the volume of the amp. To compensate, you can drag the Output 
slider, which adjusts the output volume of the plug-in without affecting the tone.
www.ebook3000.com

Adjusting Levels and Pan    401
12	 At the bottom right of the Amp Designer, drag the Output slider up slightly.
13	 Close the Amp Designer plug-in window.
14	 Stop playback.
The guitar now has a focused, crunchy, distorted sound that faithfully emulates the 
famous tone of vintage low-gain British amps. It has just enough distortion to thicken the 
tone, while adding character to the guitar and not muddying the harmony of the chords.
When customizing and adjusting amp settings, remember that all settings interact, and 
the quest for the ultimate guitar tone is rarely a sequential process. Trying a different mic 
probably means you’ll have to correct its position, and choosing a new speaker cabinet 
may require you to readjust the Gain and EQ.
 Don’t restrict the Amp Designer to dry guitar tracks! It can work wonders to 
add sizzle to a drum track, warm up a digital synth, or give an edge to a vocal track.
Adjusting Levels and Pan
Adjusting the level of each instrument may seem like the most obvious part of the mixing 
process, and you will usually start setting levels as you build the song. However, the per-
ception of an instrument’s loudness changes during the mixing process, and you will often 
have to readjust the level of an instrument after you add an effect to it or change its EQ 
settings, or when you mix other instruments that influence listener perception of that first 
instrument.
Positioning instruments to the left or the right of the stereo mix is a good way to separate 
them and make it easier for the listener to distinguish between them.
Now that you’ve adjusted the guitar amp to your desired guitar tone, you will unsolo the 
guitar track to hear how it interacts with the other instruments in the mix. You’ll turn on 
the EQ plug-in you turned off earlier, and adjust the guitar’s volume and pan to help it 
find its place in the mix.
1	
On track 26, click the Solo button (or press S) to unsolo the guitar, and start playback. 
The guitar sounds good but it’s quite loud and full.

402    Mixing
2	
In the Inspector, place the mouse pointer over the Channel EQ plug-in, and click the 
power button to turn it on.
The drastic EQ curve completely removed a good part of the low frequencies, which 
really helps focus the guitar sound, which is now thinner, and almost nasal. That 
result wouldn’t sound good for a solo guitar recording; but in a busy mix, it allows the 
guitar to play at a low volume and still cut through the mix.
3	
On the E Guit Hi channel strip, drag the Volume fader down to –16.6 dB.
You probably feel that the level of the guitar is now so low that it almost disappears. 
When you spend a lot of time adjusting the sound of an instrument, it can be difficult 
to detach yourself from it and shift your focus to the song as a whole.
To find the right level for the guitar, turning it all the way down and listening to the 
whole mix (without the electric guitar) for a while may help. Then slowly raise the 
level of the electric guitar. (Closing your eyes ensures that you use your ears, and are 
not influenced by any preconceived notion of what value the fader should be.) When 
you feel that the electric guitar adds texture to the song without taking away from the 
other instruments (especially the vocals), you’ve found the right level.
4	
On the E Guit Hi channel strip, drag the Volume fader all the way down to –∞.
www.ebook3000.com

Submixing Tracks and Processing the Submix    403
Listen to at least one entire chorus without the guitar to become accustomed to the 
sound of the instrumentation in that section. Notice that the acoustic guitar (track 
16) is panned to the right, leaving room for an equivalent instrument to the left of the 
stereo field.
5	
Slowly drag the Volume fader up to –16.6 dB.
This time you can hear the guitar find its place in the mix. Listen to how it interacts 
with the vocals. However, every time the singers sing “Big,” they mask the guitar 
chord. To avoid this issue without raising the volume of the guitar, you can move the 
electric guitar away from the center position. To complement the acoustic guitar and 
balance the mix in the stereo field, you’ll pan the electric guitar to the left.
6	
Drag the Pan knob down to –55.
The guitar is located on the left of the stereo field, where the vocals no longer mask it. 
The ostinato rhythmic chord pattern adds energy to the chorus, but stays out of the 
way and lets the vocals shine.
Submixing Tracks and Processing the Submix
When working with an ensemble of related tracks—such as the elements of a drum kit, 
an ensemble of backup vocalists, or two guitars doubling the same part—you can submix 
the signal of the group of tracks, and process the submix. Instead of using one plug-in for 
each individual track, a single plug-in can process the submix. Using one plug-in rather 
than multiple plug-ins saves CPU resources and lets you adjust the effect more quickly.
Submixing with a Summing Stack
In this exercise, you’ll use a summing stack to submix two guitars doubling the same part 
in the Interlude section, and observe how the Track Stack affects the routing of its sub-
tracks in the Mixer.

404    Mixing
1	
In the Marker Track, drag the Interlude marker (at bar 29) up to the ruler.
The cycle area corresponds to the Interlude marker.
2	
Listen to the Interlude section.
Two acoustic guitars (on tracks 17 and 18) play the same sustained chords. To make 
this section more exciting, you will later process the guitars through a tremolo plug-
in. For now, let’s look at the signal flow of the two guitar channel strips in the Mixer.
3	
Press 2 to recall screenset 2.
In the Mixer, look at the Interlude 1 and Interlude 2 channel strips (17 and 18). Both 
of them are routed to the Stereo Output (the Output channel strip located to the right 
in the Mixer).
 Double-click an output or send destination on a channel strip to select the 
corresponding destination channel strip.
Let’s create a summing stack for the two Interlude tracks.

Shift-click the Interlude 2 track header (track 18) to select both Interlude tracks.
7	
Choose Track > Create Track Stack (or press Command-Shift-D).
8	
In the Track Stack dialog, select Summing Stack.
9	
In the Track Stack dialog, click Create to create the track stack.

10	 Press 2 to recall screenset 2.
The outputs of the subtracks are set to Bus 2, and their signal is routed to the input of 
the main track (Sum 2), also set to Bus 2. On the Sum 2 channel strip, two plug-ins 
(Compressor and Channel EQ) are loaded by default, but they are turned off.
Processing the Guitars with a Tremolo Plug-in
You will now insert a Tremolo plug-in on the summing stack to process the submix of 
the two guitars. When multiple channel strips are selected in the Mixer, their settings are 
linked. To insert a plug-in on only one of the selected channel strips, you must first ensure 
that multiple channel strips aren’t selected.
1	
Press the Spacebar to start playback.
Playback starts at the beginning of the Interlude section. (You can’t see it currently, but in 
the previous exercise, you created a cycle area corresponding to the Interlude marker.)

Submixing Tracks and Processing the Submix    407
Currently, the three channel strips that form the new summing stack are selected in 
your Mixer. If you tried inserting a plug-in on one of the selected channel strips, all 
the selected channel strips would have that same plug-in inserted in the correspond-
ing slot. You need to deselect the three channel strips so that you can insert a plug-in 
to only one of them.
2	
Click the name of any channel strip in the Mixer to select that channel strip.
You can now insert a plug-in on only the Sum 2 channel strip.
3	
On the Sum 2 channel strip (17), click below the Channel EQ plug-in in the Audio FX 
area, and choose Modulation > Tremolo.
On the Channel strip, the Tremolo plug-in is inserted after the Channel EQ plug-in, 
and the Tremolo plug-in opens.
The guitar keeps moving in the stereo field. This can be useful when you want an 
auto-pan effect, but in this case, you want a simple tremolo effect in which the vol-
ume of both sides of the guitar’s stereo signal goes up and down simultaneously.

At the lower right of the Tremolo plug-in, drag the Phase knob down to 0°.
Both sides of the guitar’s stereo signal now simultaneously go up and down in volume, 
creating a bouncy feel. Let’s speed up the effect.
5	
In the Tremolo plug-in, set the Rate to 1/8.
The Tremolo makes the guitar bounce up and down in volume every eighth note, 
which adds a rhythmic effect to the interlude, and novelty to the section. The side 
effect is that the guitars are now perceived to be softer in the mix. To compensate, you 
can use the Volume fader of the Sum 2 channel strip.

On the Sum 2 channel strip, drag the Volume fader up to +4.0 dB.

Submixing Tracks and Processing the Submix    409
The tremolo effect sounds great, but the two guitars feel confined in the center of the ste-
reo field, along with the Glockenspiel (channel strip 13). Not many instruments are play-
ing during the interlude, so you can spread the guitars apart to add width to their mix.
7	
Pan the Interlude 1 channel strip all the way to the left, and pan the Interlude 2 chan-
nel strip all the way to the right.
The guitars are spread out to each side of the stereo field, leaving more room in the 
center for the glockenspiel. The mix is wider, giving an impression of space, and each 
instrument has its own place in the stereo field.
Although you are done working with the Tremolo plug-in, there’s no need to close its 
window, as you will now recall screenset 1. And since screenset 2 was locked before 
you opened the Tremolo plug-in, that plug-in will not be reopened the next time you 
recall screenset 2.

makes the guitars bounce in volume, and spreading the guitars in the stereo field produces 
a wider stereo mix, while giving breathing room to the individual instruments.
Using an EQ Plug-in
The sound of an instrument comprises several frequencies mixed together in varying 
amounts. By applying an EQ plug-in to attenuate or boost certain ranges of frequency, you 
can alter the timbre of the sound, much as you would change the sound of your music 
player by tweaking the bass or treble EQ settings.
EQ plug-ins can shape the sound of your instruments, focusing them in a specific fre-
quency range and helping each instrument cut through the mix without boosting the 
overall level of its channel strip. Equalizing (EQing) an instrument can also decrease 
unwanted frequencies in its recording and keep it from masking another instrument in 
the same frequency range.
To shape the frequency spectrum of a vocal track, you will use the Channel EQ plug-in to 
attenuate some of its low rumbling while boosting some of the high frequencies to give it 
some air.

fields
The Channel EQ plug-in allows you to adjust eight bands of EQ. You can toggle a 
band on and off by clicking the button at the top of that band. By default, the first and 
last bands are turned off, and all the other bands are turned on. Each band’s settings 
are shown below the graphic display in the EQ band fields. All the bands that are 
turned on by default have their Gain parameters set to 0.0 dB; and in the graphic dis-
play, the EQ curve is flat, which means that the Channel EQ is not currently affecting 
the audio signal on the channel strip.
Clicking the Analyzer button turns on the frequency analyzer, which displays the fre-
quency spectrum curve of the sound on the graphic display when the track is playing.
 By default, the frequency analyzer displays the frequency spectrum of the 
sound at the output of the Channel EQ plug-in. You can click the Post EQ button 
inside the Analyzer button to switch the frequency analyzer to pre EQ. It will then 
display the frequency spectrum of the sound at the input of the Channel EQ, before 
being processed by the Channel EQ plug-in.

Click the Analyzer button.

412    Mixing
A curve appears in the graphic display, showing the sound’s frequency spectrum in 
real time. Listen closely to the vocals as you watch the occasional movement in the 
very low range of frequencies (to the left). Feel free to raise your monitoring volume 
on your audio interface, or use the Volume fader on the Ami Vox channel strip. You 
can hear some low-frequency noises in the recording, especially at the beginning of 
bar 35. In vocal recordings, those low-frequency noises are often generated by the 
singer accidentally touching the mic stand, or by the mic cable rubbing against the 
mic stand.
You will filter out those very low frequencies to attenuate the unwanted noises.

To the left, click the first Band On/Off button to turn on that EQ band.
The first EQ band’s shape appears on the graphic display. You can see that the low fre-
quencies are slightly attenuated around 20 Hz.

In the parameter section below the graphic display, drag the Frequency parameter of 
the first band up to 400 Hz.
The EQ band shape updates in the graphic display. In the frequency curve displayed

ing from a cheap sound system.
You have to adjust the Frequency parameter of that first band so that the low-fre-
quency noises are attenuated as much as possible without affecting the vocals.
7	
Drag the Frequency of the first band down to 220 Hz.
You can hear the full vocal sound, and not the low-frequency noises. Mission 
accomplished!
Now you will attenuate the low/mid frequencies to remove the “mud” from the vocals. 
Instead of adjusting the numerical settings in the parameter section, you’ll drag the 
pointer in the graphic display to adjust the shape of individual bands.

Position the mouse pointer over the upper half of the graphic display, and move it 
from left to right.
Pivot point
As you move the pointer horizontally, the EQ band fields are shaded in different col-
ors at the bottom of the Channel EQ to show you which EQ band is selected. You can 
shape the curve of the selected band by dragging in the graphic display:
▶
▶To adjust the gain, drag vertically.
▶
▶To adjust the frequency, drag horizontally.
▶
▶To adjust the Q (or width, or resonance), vertically Option-Command-drag the 
pivot point (which appears at that band’s frequency).
You first need to adjust the band’s gain to see its shape on the graphic display.

Position the pointer to select the fourth band, which is currently set to a frequency of 
250 Hz.

414    Mixing
10	 Drag down so that the Gain parameter below reads –7.0 dB.
The shape of the selected EQ band appears on the graphic display, and the settings 
below are adjusted accordingly.
Now, while listening to the vocal, you will adjust both the Q and the frequency of the 
EQ band you are attenuating.
11	 Drag the band to the right to set its frequency to 470 Hz.
12	 Option-Command-drag the pivot point down to widen the band of EQ until the Q field 
below reads 0.23.
The vocal sounds less muddy already. Remember to click that EQ band’s On/Off but-

The vocal now sounds a bit less dull, and more present. Let’s compare the sound of 
the vocal with and without the Channel EQ.
14	 In the plug-in header, click the On/Off button.
The button is dimmed to indicate that the Channel EQ is off. On the Channel EQ 
graphic display, the curve disappears because the audio signal is no longer routed 
through the plug-in.
You can now hear the unprocessed vocal recording. The low-frequency noises are

Instead of closing the Channel EQ window, you can recall the current screenset to 
return it to its locked state.
20	 Press 1 to recall screenset 1.
The screenset is recalled, and the Channel EQ window is no longer open.
By applying an EQ plug-in to the vocal, you shaped its frequency spectrum to eliminate 
unwanted low-frequency noises, and clarify the vocal, establishing its appropriate place in 
the frequency spectrum of the mix.
Using Delay and Reverberation
In a natural environment, an instrument’s sound is reflected by the floor, walls, and ceil-
ing of the room. The sounds of those reflections, combined with the direct sound of the 
instrument, allow listeners to determine the distance from the instrument to their ears 
and understand the nature of the acoustic space.
When recording instruments, you can choose to record in an absorbent studio to primar-
ily record the direct sound of each instrument. Then you apply delay and reverberation 
plug-ins to create artificial reflections, giving you total control over the apparent place-
ment and depth of the instruments.
Adding Delay to the Vocals
Delay can be applied so you can clearly hear the distinct repeats of the sound echoing, or 
it can be applied with shorter delay times to create an ambience, similar to a reverb.
You will now add a Tape Delay plug-in to a vocal track to create a classic slap-back delay, a 
vintage effect popularized by the Beatles, who often used it liberally on John Lennon’s voice.

On the Duvid Vox channel strip, in the Audio FX area, click below the Compressor, 
and choose Delay > Tape Delay.
The Tape Delay plug-in is inserted, and its window opens.
You hear the reflections applied to the vocals as an echo. By default, the Tape Delay 
is automatically synchronized to the project tempo so that reflections are produced 
every quarter note. To get a slap-back effect, you needn’t synchronize the delay to the 
grid, and you want the repeats to occur faster.

418    Mixing
4	
Click the Sync button to disable it.
To the left of the Sync button, the Delay time changes from 375.0 ms to 500.0 ms, and 
you can hear that the repeats are no longer in sync with the song’s tempo.
5	
Drag the Delay value down to around 100 ms, then Shift-drag the Delay value to fine-
tune it to around 88.1 ms.
The delay is now very short, and you can no longer hear distinct repeats. Instead the 
delay creates an ambiance similar to recording the vocal in a very small reflective room.
You can drag the two Output sliders to the right to adjust the level balance between 
Dry (the sound not affected by the plug-in) and Wet (the reflections generated by the 
plug-in). You will bring the Dry signal all the way up to its maximum level, so that 
you maintain the same level of direct sound as you had before inserting the plug-in.
6	
Drag the Dry slider up to 100%.
You can now adjust the level of the delay effect with the Wet slider. Let’s make the 
effect a little more subtle.

Here again, because you were focused on the sound of the delay, you may feel as if 
you just turned the effect down so much that you don’t hear it any more. To fully hear

8	
In the plug-in header, click the On/Off button to turn off the plug-in. The vocal 
sounds much drier.

Turn the plug-in back on. The Tape Delay adds a little bit of slap-back echo, creating 
an ambience while keeping the vocal sound fairly natural.
10	 Keep the Duvid Vox track soloed, and stop playback.
Adding Reverb Using Aux Sends
You could insert a reverb plug-in directly into the channel strip of the instrument you 
want to process, just as you inserted a delay plug-in in the previous exercise. However, 
when you use reverb to simulate the sound of instruments in a room, applying an indi-
vidual reverb plug-in for each instrument would require a lot of processing power. You 
would also have to readjust the parameters of each reverb plug-in every time you wanted 
to change the acoustics of your artificial room.
Instead, you can use aux sends to route some of the signal from a channel strip to a new 
auxiliary channel strip. When you have set up an aux channel strip with the desired reverb 
plug-in, you can add reverberation to any instrument by sending some of its signal to that 
aux for processing.
In this exercise, you will use a bus send to route a vocal track to an aux, and insert the 
reverberation plug-in on the aux channel strip. Later you’ll send another vocal track to the 
same aux to give it the same reverb sound.
A track is still soloed from the previous exercise. To unsolo it and solo a new track, you 
can Option-click the new track’s Solo button.

Select the Gang Vox 1 track (track 31) and Option-click its Solo button. The Duvid 
Vox track is unsoloed, and the Gang Vox 1 track is soloed.

On the Gang Vox 1 channel strip, click the Send slot, and choose Bus > Bus 7.

420    Mixing
When you click a Send slot and choose an available bus, a new aux channel strip is 
automatically added to the Mixer. In the Inspector, the channel strip to the right auto-
matically shows the new Aux 6 channel strip, and you can see the signal path from the 
lead vocal channel strip to the aux channel strip. At the top of the Aux 6 channel strip, 
the input is set to Bus 7.
 On the left channel strip, click the desired Send or Output slot to display the 
corresponding output or auxiliary channel strip to the right of the Inspector. When 
you click a send, make sure that you click the right area of the Send slot to avoid tog-
gling its On/Off button.
Let’s insert the reverb plug-in on the aux.

On the Gang Vox 1 channel strip, drag the Bus 7 Send Level knob down to around 
–12.0 (dB).
You can now send the audio signal from any channel strip to Bus 7 to route it to Aux 
6 and add the same reverb effect to its sound. The Gang Vox 1 track was doubled on 
the Gang Vox 2 track, so let’s open the Mixer and send the Gang Vox 2 track to the 
same reverb.

Using Dynamic Processing Plug-ins
The dynamic range of a recording is the difference between the quietest and loudest parts 
of the recording. Sometimes too much dynamic range in a recording can be a problem 
because the loudest parts become too loud, and the quietest parts drop to barely audible 
levels. You can use dynamic processing plug-ins such as a compressor or a limiter to 
adjust the dynamic range of an audio signal, usually to make the audio signal level more 
consistent over time.
Dynamic processing can be applied to a single channel strip, a submix of a group of 
instruments, or to an entire mix.
Using the Compressor
When recording an instrument, the musician rarely plays all the notes at the same vol-
ume. Singers need more energy to reach higher pitches, and they relax to sing low pitches, 
resulting in uneven loudness throughout a melody line. This variation can become a chal-
lenge when mixing, as some of the notes stick out and others are buried in the mix.
www.ebook3000.com

Using Dynamic Processing Plug-ins    425
A compressor attenuates a signal when its level reaches a specific threshold. You can use 
it to lower the volume of loud notes and then raise the overall level of the instrument to 
increase the volume of softer notes.
In this exercise, you will apply a compressor plug-in to even out the dynamic range of a 
vocal track, making sure that you can hear all the words at the same level.
1	
In the Tracks area, drag the V2 marker up to the ruler.
2	
Select and solo the Ami Vox track (track 29).
3	
Start playback.
The level of the vocal recording fluctuates as the singer hits different pitches. On the 
level meter in the Ami Vox channel strip, you can see higher notes reach higher levels 
than lower notes.
4	
On the Ami Vox channel strip, click below the Channel EQ plug-in, and choose 
Dynamic > Compressor.
The Gain Reduction meter shows by how many decibels the compressor is attenuating 
the audio signal. The little bit of activity on the meter indicates that the compressor is 
barely attenuating the vocals.

426    Mixing
NOTE ▶ ​On channel strips, you can also use the Gain Reduction meter (below the 
Setting button) to see how much gain reduction is applied by the Compressor plug-in, 
or any other dynamic plug-in inserted in the Audio FX section.
Gain Reduction meter
 Double-click the Gain Reduction meter on a channel strip to open the first 
compressor or limiter plug-in in the Audio FX section of that channel strip. When 
no dynamic plug-in is present, double-clicking the Gain Reduction meter inserts a 
Compressor plug-in in the first available Audio FX slot.
The Gain and Auto Gain parameters help compensate for the gain reduction by 
applying a constant gain at the output of the compressor (also known as make-up 
gain). To hear only the gain reduction, let’s eliminate the make-up gain.
5	
Option-click the Gain slider to set it to 0.0 dB. From the Auto Gain pop-up menu, 
choose Off.
Without make-up gain, the compressor can apply only gain reduction, so it can only 
turn down the volume when the vocals reach levels higher than the Threshold param-
eter. Remember to turn the Compressor on and off as you adjust it to compare the 
sound of the vocal with and without the compression effect.
From the Circuit Type pop-up menu, you can choose from different models based on 
vintage hardware compressors. Except for Platinum, which is a transparent compres-
sor, each circuit type adds its own color to the signal.

Using Dynamic Processing Plug-ins    427
The Gain Reduction meter is inactive. Right now, the compressor isn’t having any 
effect on the vocals. You will now adjust the threshold so that all notes trigger the 
compressor.
7	
Drag the Compressor Threshold down to –34.5 dB.
On the Gain Reduction meter, you can see the compressor being triggered by all the 
notes, working harder on higher-pitched notes, while barely attenuating the lower-
pitched notes.
You can adjust the amount of compression with the Ratio slider, which changes the 
ratio by which the signal is reduced when it exceeds the threshold.
8	
Drag the Ratio slider to 2.0:1.
The vocal level sounds more consistent. You can clearly hear the singer even when he 
sings lower pitches, and higher-pitched notes no longer jump out.
Don’t hesitate to experiment using higher ratio values to increase the amounts of 
compression. Be aware, however, that high ratio values may attenuate the high-
pitched notes too much and produce an unnatural-sounding result.
Now that the compressor is reducing the gain, the vocal sounds lower in volume, so 
you can apply some make-up gain.
9	
Drag the Gain slider up to 2.5 dB.

428    Mixing
The vocals have roughly the same overall loudness as when you first started compress-
ing them, making it easy to hear the effect of the compressor by toggling it on and off.
10	 Stop playback.
11	 Unsolo the Ami Vox track, turn off Cycle mode, and close the Compressor plug-in 
window.
Compressing and Limiting the Mix
On a professional project, you would usually send your final mix to a mastering engineer, 
who would put a final polish on the audio file using subtle amounts of EQ, compression, 
reverb, or other processing.
When you don’t have the budget to hire a mastering engineer, you can master your own 
mix by inserting plug-ins on the Stereo Out channel strip, as in this exercise. You will start 
by using a compressor to make the mix level more consistent throughout the song, and 
then apply a limiter to raise the perceived loudness without clipping the Stereo Out chan-
nel strip audio.
1	
Start playback at the beginning of the song.
2	
On the Output channel strip, click the Audio FX area, and choose Dynamic > 
Compressor.
This time you will use a setting designed to emulate the soft compression of analog 
tape recorders.

NOTE ▶ ​If you’ve adjusted the volume of the song using the Volume slider that 
appears in the control bar or the Volume fader on the Master channel strip in the 
Mixer, make sure you Option-click it now to return it to 0 dB.
The Output channel strip is clipping, as indicated by the red peak level display. In the 
compressor window, the gain reduction shows a few decibels of gain reduction, but 
the Auto Gain parameter applies enough make-up gain to make the mix clip.
4	
In the Compressor, from the Auto Gain pop-up menu, choose Off.
The peak level display continues to display the most recent maximum peak value. You 
need to reset it to determine if the new compressor setting still clips the mix.
5	
On the Output channel strip, click the peak level display to reset it. The mix is no lon-
ger clipping.
You will now insert a limiter after the compressor to raise the gain without clipping 
the output. A limiter works similarly to a compressor, but attenuates the signal so that 
the output signal never exceeds a specific volume level.

430    Mixing
6	
On the Output channel strip, click below the Compressor, and choose Dynamics > 
Adaptive Limiter.
The meters to the left display the signal level at the input of the plug-in; the meters 
to the right display the signal level at the output of the plug-in. At the bottom of the 
Adaptive Limiter plug-in window, the Out Ceiling is set to 0.0 dB, ensuring that the 
audio signal will never go over 0 dBFS on the Stereo Out channel strip. 
When adjusting the Adaptive Limiter, you should adjust the Input Scale knob to avoid 
producing red over warnings on the input meters. Sometimes a few red overs can be 
OK, but when in doubt, trust your ears!
7	
Drag the Input Scale up to +2.8 dB.
Keep playing the song, and make sure that the overs at the top of the left meter don’t 
turn red all the time.
 At the top of the input meters, you can click the red over warnings to reset them.
You can now adjust the Gain knob in the middle of the plug-in window to raise the 
perceived level of the mix. You now need to pay close attention to what you are hear-
ing. Although it is tempting to raise the gain to produce a louder mix, higher gain set-
tings can introduce distortion.

Using a Few Tips and Tricks    431
8	
Drag the Gain knob all the way up to 12.0 dB.
You hear the distortion introduced by the Adaptive Limiter, even though the signal is 
not clipping on the Output channel strip meters.
 When you are not sure how a specific plug-in parameter affects the sound, 
don’t hesitate to turn it all the way up and all the way down to find out. The results 
probably won’t be good, but hearing those extremes will demonstrate how that 
parameter affects the sound, and you will know what to listen for as you adjust the 
parameter to a more reasonable setting.
9	
Drag the Gain down to around 6 dB.
Even though the Adaptive Limiter’s output meters still display over warnings, the 
audible distortion disappears.
10	 In the Adaptive Limiter plug-in header, click the On/Off button to toggle it on and off.
The compressor makes your mix sound more consistent. The Adaptive Limiter gives you 
a nice gain boost on the whole mix and ensures that no clipping occurs at the output.
You have finished your mix using effect plug-ins and adjusting the four main parameters 
of the instrument sounds (volume levels, pan position, frequency, and distance) to give 
each sound its own place in the stereo sound field.
Using a Few Tips and Tricks
As with any other art, mixing requires a combination of skill, experience, and talent. It 
takes practice to learn how to apply mixing techniques efficiently, and even more practice 
to learn to listen. Here are a few tips and tricks that will help you perfect your craft and 
become better at mixing your projects.
Take a Break
After you mix for a while, listening to the same song for the hundredth time, you can lose 
your objectivity and experience ear fatigue. Take frequent short breaks while mixing, and 
return to the mix with rested ears. You will be able to better judge your results.

432    Mixing
Listen to Your Mix Outside the Studio
When you feel that your mix is pretty advanced and you are happy with the way it sounds 
in your studio, copy it to a portable music player and listen to it in another room, or even 
better, in your car while driving. You will probably hear things you didn’t notice in your 
studio, and miss things you could hear clearly in your studio. You can take notes and 
return to your studio to rework the mix. Obviously, the mix will never sound the same in 
the studio and in the car, but it’s the mixing engineer’s job to make sure that all the instru-
ments can be heard in most situations.
Compare Your Mix with Commercial Mixes
Compare your mix with commercial mixes you like. Build a small library of good-sound-
ing mixes in the same genre of music as the songs you are mixing. You can open a new 
Logic project, and place your mix on one track and a professional mix on another track so 
that you can solo and compare them.

When multitrack recorders first appeared in recording studios, they 
forever changed the way artists produced music. Having separate record-
ings of individual instruments opened the door for experimentation, and 
soon artists and producers alike placed their hands on the mixing board 
during the final mixdown—panning an instrument from left to right or 
riding a volume fader to change the level of a track throughout a song. 
Soon enough, two or three pairs of hands weren’t enough to perform all 
the changes needed throughout a mix, and a solution was needed.
Eventually, mixing consoles were designed on which moving a fader 
also generated a data stream. By recording those data streams onto a 
separate track of the multitrack tape, the console could automatically 
recreate those fader movements during playback. This started the era of 
automated consoles. Today, professional computerized mixing boards 
and digital audio workstations are fully automated.
Automating the Mix
Lesson 10

436    Automating the Mix
In Logic, you can automate almost all the controls on a channel strip, including volume, 
pan, and plug-in parameters. In this lesson, you will draw and edit offline automation to 
bring down the volume of a vocoder (a synthesized vocal recording) during the breaks, 
pan a sound effect from left to right, and turn off a plug-in at the end of a section. You 
will then record live automation to swipe a low-pass filter over the vocoder, pan the 
vocoder across the stereo field, and turn off an EQ at the beginning of a section.
Creating and Editing Offline Automation
In Logic, the techniques used to create and edit track-based automation closely resemble 
MIDI Draw, which you used to graphically edit MIDI continuous controller events in 
Lesson 6. While MIDI Draw allows you to automate MIDI CC parameters in a region, 
track automation lets you automate almost any channel strip controls independent of the 
regions on the track.
Drawing automation graphically is also known as offline automation, because it is applied 
without regard for the playhead position and can be performed while Logic is not playing.
Creating Automation Curves to Adjust Section Volume
When you need to accurately control the volume of an instrument in specific sections of 
a song, drawing offline automation over the waveform enables surgical precision without 
the pressure of performing fader movements in real time.
In this exercise, you will add offline volume automation to a vocal track so that the track 
plays more softly during the breakdowns.

Play the song, and listen to the Vocoder Chorus track (track 28) in both breakdown 
sections (at bar 29 and at bar 89).
NOTE ▶ ​Remember to use Solo mode along with Shift-Spacebar (Play from Selection) 
to listen to a specific region or group of regions.
You will bring the vocals down slightly in those two sections.

Track Automation button
Automation button
Automation track
In the Tracks area, tracks must be tall enough to display their automation curves, so 
the Tracks area is automatically zoomed in vertically. On the selected track, the Track 
Automation button is automatically turned on, and an automation track shows the 
currently empty volume automation curve.
 When an automation track is shown, you can edit regions (move, copy, resize, 
and so on) in the thin lane containing the region names.
You will now create a volume automation curve to reduce the volume of the vocoded 
vocals in the Breakdown at bar 29.
5	
On the Vocoder Chorus track, click anywhere in the automation track.
A control point is created at the beginning of the project (bar 1) at the current Vol-
ume fader value, 0.0 dB; and the automation curve is shaded yellow to indicate that 
some automation data is now present.
6	
Zoom in on the beginning of the Vocoder Chorus region at bar 29, below the Break-
down 1 marker.
You can create control points by clicking the automation curve.

438    Automating the Mix
7	
Click the volume automation curve just before and just after the beginning of bar 33 
to create two 0 dB control points.
8	
Create two more control points before the Vocoder Chorus region beginning at bar 29.
9	
In the Breakdown 1 section, drag the automation curve down to –2.6 dB.
 You can also draw automation curves using the Pencil tool.
10	 Start playback before the four control points (at bar 28).
Look at the Volume slider in the track header, or the Volume fader in the Inspector. 
They both move to reflect the volume automation curve on the track, dropping down 
from 0 dB to –2.6 dB just before the breakdown, and coming back up to 0 dB at the 
beginning of the chorus.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing Offline Automation    439
If you’re not happy with the timing of your automation, feel free to zoom in on any of 
the control points, and drag them to other locations.
You will now create similar automation in the second breakdown.
11	 Scroll to the right until you can see the Breakdown 2 marker (bar 89).
This time, you will use the Marquee tool to select a section of the automation curve, and 
then drag down the selected section of the curve. To quickly select the entire region, you 
can Option-click the region with the Marquee tool, your current Command-click tool. 
Since the automation track is displayed, you’ll have to click in the region name area.
12	 Command-Option-click the name area of the Vocoder Chorus region to select it with 
the Marquee tool. The region is highlighted.
13	 In the Breakdown 2 section, drag the automation curve down to around –2.7 dB.
As you drag the line down, you can see two nodes created on each end of the Mar-
quee selection, so dragging the automation curve will adjust the volume only for the 
selected section.
14	 Click the background of the workspace to clear the selection, and press Z to see all the 
regions.
15	 Listen to the Breakdown 2 section by starting playback around bar 88.
At the beginning of the breakdown, the Volume fader in the Inspector drops down 
from 0 dB to –2.7 dB. At the end of the section, the Volume fader returns to 0 dB.
When you’re happy with the automation curve, you can adjust the overall volume 
level of the track by trimming the automation on the track.
16	 In the control bar, click the “Go to Beginning” button (or press Return).

440    Automating the Mix
17	 Zoom in on the Vocoder Chorus track. In the track header, place the mouse pointer over 
the numerical display (the parameter value changes to Trim) and drag up to +1.0 dB.
The automation curve for the entire track is raised by 1.0 dB.
18	 Click the background, and press Z to zoom out.
Creating Pan Automation
Applying pan automation can be a fun way to create movement in your mix, moving a 
sound from one side of the stereo field to the other. It is a powerful effect that calls atten-
tion to the automated sound, but when used in moderation, can add life to a sound effect.
Let’s draw offline pan automation on the first sound effect at the end of the intro to move 
it from the left speaker to the right speaker.
1	
Select the FX rise 1 track (track 7).
2	
Control-Option-drag the workspace to zoom in on the first region of the track.
The Track Automation button is dimmed, and the automation curve is not visible.
3	
From the Automation Parameter pop-up menu, choose Main > Pan.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing Offline Automation    441
Automation Parameter pop-up menu
The Track Automation button is automatically turned on, and the pan automation 
curve appears on the track.
4	
Click anywhere on the automation track.
At the beginning of the automation track, a control point is created for the current 
pan value (0).
To create control points away from the automation curve, you can double-click using 
the Pointer tool.
5	
Double-click the top of the automation track just before the FX rise 1 region.
Let’s readjust the position of the control point you just created to start the panning 
effect all the way to the left at the beginning of the sound effect.

442    Automating the Mix
6	
Drag the control point you just created up as far as you can, and as close as possible to 
the beginning of the region.
7	
Double-click the automation track at the end of the FX rise 1 region.
The automation curve goes from the upper left to the lower right of the region, repre-
senting the pan position of the track going from the left speaker to the right speaker.
8	
Listen to the intro.
The Pan knob in the track header and the Pan knob on the FX rise 1 channel strip 
in the Inspector reflect the automation curve, moving from center to the left at the 
beginning of the intro, then from left to right during the FX rise 1 region. You can 
hear the sound effect move from the left to the right of the stereo field.
Let’s look at the pan automation curve for the whole track.
9	
Control-option-click the workspace to zoom out.
To quickly zoom in vertically on the selected track, you can use Auto Track Zoom.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing Offline Automation    443
10	 In the Tracks area main menu bar, choose View > Auto Track Zoom (or press 
Control-Z).
The selected track expands vertically, and you can see its automation curve. Following 
the automation curve you created over the first region, the automation curve remains 
at a low position throughout the rest of the track. As a result, all the sound effects 
after the intro will play on the right side of the stereo field. Let’s bring them back to 
the center.
11	 Between the first two regions on the track, Double-click the automation track to cre-
ate a control point; and if necessary, drag it to a value of 0.
The pan automation curve shows a flat horizontal line after the new control point, 
and the rest of the track will play the sound effect in the center of the stereo field.
12	 Listen from the beginning of the song to the end of the Theme 1 section.
After the panning effect on the first region, the Pan knob returns to and stays at its 
center position.
Creating and Snapping Mute Automation
Mute automation can be very useful when you need an instrument or sound to drop out 
instantaneously. While you can edit a region to make it stop playing at a specific point, some 
effect plug-ins such as delay or reverberation may continue to produce sound after the play-
head moves past the end of the region. Muting the channel strip ensures that the audio sig-
nal processed by the plug-ins on the channel strip is no longer routed to the stereo output.

444    Automating the Mix
In this exercise, you will mute a reverberant snare drum to stop its ringing at a specific 
location in the arrangement.
1	
Select the Snare track (track 4).
The Snare track expands vertically, while the FX rise 1 track returns to its original 
vertical zoom level.
You can Option-click a marker to position the playhead at the beginning of that marker.
2	
In the Marker track, Option-click the Build-up marker (bar 57).
The playhead jumps to the beginning of the marker.
3	
Listen to the Build-up section.
At the end of the section, a drum fill ends with a reverberant snare leading into the 
next section, Theme 3. While the build-up ends with a rising sound effect and a busy 
drum fill, the Theme 3 section begins with a very intimate mix. To accentuate the 
difference in ambiance between the sections, you can mute the reverberated snare so 
that its reverb tail stops abruptly at the end of the build-up.
4	
In the Snare track header, from the Automation Parameter pop-up menu, choose 
Main > Mute.
5	
Click anywhere in the automation track to create a control point at the beginning of 
the track with the current parameter value (mute off).
6	
Zoom in on the Snare region at the end of the build-up.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing Offline Automation    445
To abruptly cut out the snare exactly before the Theme 3 section, you need to create 
a control point at exactly 65 1 1 1. You will now use the snap modes to create control 
points that are aligned with the grid.
7	
In the Tracks area menu bar, from the Snap pop-up menu, choose “Snap Automation 
to Absolute Values.”
By default, Logic snaps control points five ticks before the closest grid line. This 
default behavior can be useful when automating, for example, a compressor that 
needs to be turned on before a downbeat so it can be triggered by the attack of a note 
on the downbeat. But, you don’t need that default offset here.
8	
From the Snap pop-up menu, choose Automation Snap Offset to open the Automa-
tion preferences window.
9	
In the preferences window, set the Snap Offset to 0 Ticks, and then close the window.

446    Automating the Mix
10	 At bar 65, double-click in the lower half of the automation track.
A control point with the value Muted is created. Note that the mute parameter has 
only two possible values (Unmuted and Muted).
Let’s check the position of the control point you just created.
11	 Over the control point, click and hold down the mouse button.
The help tag displays the position of the control point as 65 1 1 1.
12	 From the Snap pop-up menu, choose “Snap Automation to Absolute Values” to turn 
it off.
13	 Listen to the build-up.
While you can see that the track is muted at bar 65, you may have difficulty hearing 
exactly where the snare stops when the whole song is playing. Let’s solo the snare.
14	 Solo the Snare track, and listen again.
You can hear the snare sound and its reverb effect stop abruptly at bar 65. Let’s listen 
to the Snare track without any mute automation. First you’ll position the playhead in 
a section where the Snare track is not muted.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating and Editing Offline Automation    447
15	 Place the playhead before bar 65, but do not start playback yet.
The Snare track is unmuted.
16	 On the Snare track header, click the Track Automation button to turn off the automa-
tion on that track.
17	 Listen to the build-up.
The Snare track remains unmuted and you can hear the reverb tail sustain past 65 1 1 1.
18	 On the Snare track header, click the Track Automation button to turn automation 
back on.
Let’s now unmute the snare for the remainder of the track.
19	 At the top of the automation track after the end of the region, double click in bar 66 
to unmute the snare.
20	 Unsolo the snare track.
21	 In the Tracks area main menu bar, choose View > Auto Track Zoom (or press Control-Z) 
to turn off Auto Track Zoom.

448    Automating the Mix
Recording Live Automation
While offline automation is a good option when you know in advance what automation 
movements you want to achieve, you sometimes want to hear the song playing as you 
adjust channel strip or plug-in controls in real time.
To record live automation, you need to choose a live automation mode for the track(s) you 
want to automate, start playback, and then tweak the desired plug-in or channel strip controls.
Recording Automation in Touch Mode
When you start playback in Touch mode, any existing automation on the track is read (as 
if Logic were in Read mode). As soon as you hold down the mouse button on a knob or 
slider, Logic starts recording the new values. When you release the mouse button, Touch 
mode behaves like Read mode again, and the automation parameter returns to its original 
value or reproduces any existing automation on the track.
In this exercise, you will use the Touch mode to automate closing a low-pass filter on the 
Vocoder track during the build-up.
1	
At the beginning of the Build-up section, zoom in on the Vocoder region.
2	
In the Marker track, drag the Build-up marker (at bar 57) up to the ruler, and listen to 
the section.
You will automate one of the bands of the Channel EQ plug-in inserted on the 
Vocoder channel strip to progressively filter more high frequencies, evolving the vocal 
sound throughout the first half of the build-up.
3	
Select the Vocoder track (track 27), and solo it.
4	
In the Vocoder track header, click the Track Automation button to turn it on, and 
from the Automation Mode pop-up menu, choose Touch.

5	
In the Inspector, click the middle of the Channel EQ plug-in to open its window.
 You can also double-click the EQ display at the top of the channel strip to 
open the Channel EQ plug-in.
In the Channel EQ, you will automate the frequency of the low-pass filter, the last 
band of EQ all the way to the right.
6	
Position the mouse pointer over the low-pass EQ band’s frequency.
NOTE ▶ ​Remember that you needn’t choose a parameter from the track header’s 
Automation Parameter pop-up menu to record live automation.
You are ready to record live automation. You don’t need to put Logic in record mode 
to record live automation. You need only to put the track in one of the live automa-
tion modes (Touch, Latch, or Write) and start playback.
When you record automation in Touch mode, hold down the mouse button until you 
want the parameter to return to its original level (in this case, after the end of the 
Vocoder region in the Build-up section).
7	
Press the Spacebar to start playback, and in the Channel EQ, slowly drag the fre-
quency value down while listening to the effect on the vocoded voice.

450    Automating the Mix
When you first click the frequency parameter in the plug-in window, on the Vocoder 
track header, the Automation Parameter pop-up menu displays that frequency param-
eter (2 Channel EQ: High Cut Frequency).
NOTE ▶ ​High cut is another name for a low pass filter.
As you drag down the frequency during playback, control points are added to the 
automation curve to record the new frequency values.
8	
After the playhead moves past the end of the region, release the mouse button.
The frequency automation returns to its original value on the track (17,000 Hz).
www.ebook3000.com

Recording Live Automation    451
9	
Press the Spacebar to stop playback, and press the Spacebar again to resume playback 
at the beginning of the build-up.
In the Channel EQ window, you see the frequency value at the bottom right reflect 
the automation curve value at the playhead position. On the graphic display, the EQ 
curve changes to reflect the closing of the low pass filter.
10	 Stop playback.
If you are not happy with the automation curve you recorded, you can stay in Touch 
mode and correct your automation. Let’s do so now to drop the frequency a little faster 
at the beginning of the section, and slower toward the end of the Vocoder region.
11	 Start playback.
As long as you don’t touch it, the frequency parameter reproduces the frequency 
automation on the track.
12	 When you’re ready to start correcting your automation curve, drag the frequency 
value down in the Channel EQ window.
As soon as you start dragging the frequency parameter, the new values overwrite the 
existing frequency automation.
13	 Before the end of the region, release the mouse button.
The frequency parameter responds to the existing frequency automation on the track.

452    Automating the Mix
 When you release the mouse button in Touch mode, the time it takes for the 
automation curve to go from the last recorded value to the first existing value is called 
ramp time. The default ramp time is 200 ms, and you can adjust it in Logic Pro X > 
Preferences > Automation.
14	 Stop playback.
Repeat steps 11 through 13 until you are happy with your automation curve.
Be careful! A common mistake is to move on to another task and leave the automa-
tion mode set to Touch. However, when you do so, any further changes you make 
to that track’s channel strip or any of its plug-in parameters during playback are 
recorded on the automation track (even if the track is not selected and the Automa-
tion button in the Tracks area menu bar is dimmed). To avoid accidentally recording 
more automation, let’s return the automation mode to Read.
15	 In the Vocoder track header, from the Automation Mode pop-up menu, choose Read.
16	 Unsolo the Vocoder track, close the Channel EQ plug-in window, and listen to your 
automation.
www.ebook3000.com

Recording Live Automation    453
In the first half of the build-up, the vocoded vocals start bright and get progressively 
duller, similar to the effect you hear when walking out of a room where someone is 
singing. The timbral evolution of the vocal keeps things moving and adds interest to 
the section.
Recording Automation in Latch Mode
Latch mode works similar to Touch mode, except that when you release the mouse button, 
the automation continues to record and the parameter stays at the current value. If auto-
mation is already present for that parameter on that track, the automation is overwritten 
until you stop playback.
You will now enable Latch mode to record pan automation on the same Vocoder region 
you worked with in the previous exercise.
1	
Listen to the Build-up section.
The vocoded vocal stays in the center of the stereo field for the length of the Vocoder 
region.
2	
In the Vocoder track header, set the automation mode to Latch.
If you started playback now and dragged the Vocoder track’s Pan knob, the Automa-
tion Parameter pop-up menu would automatically switch to Pan to show you the 
automation curve you’re recording. If you prefer, you can view multiple automation 
curves for a single track.
3	
In the Vocoder track header, click the disclosure triangle next to the Automation 
Mode pop-up menu.

454    Automating the Mix
A separate automation subtrack opens below the track. By default, it shows the (cur-
rently empty) volume automation curve.
 To open more than one automation subtrack, place the mouse pointer over 
the subtrack header and click the + (plus sign) button that appears at the bottom. To 
close an automation subtrack, place the mouse pointer over the subtrack header and 
click the x button that appears at the top. You can also drag subtracks vertically to 
reorder them.
You will use pan automation to place the first two bars (bars 57 and 58) of vocoded 
vocals on the left side of the mix, and the two last bars (bars 59 and 60) on the right 
side of the mix.
4	
Click the cycle area to turn off Cycle mode.
5	
Start playback a couple of bars before the Build-up marker.
6	
Before the playhead reaches the Vocoder region, drag the Pan knob on the track 
header to around –40, and release the mouse button.
The pan automation is recorded on the subtrack, and the Pan knob remains in the 
position it was in when you released the mouse button.
7	
When the playhead reaches bar 59, quickly drag up the Pan knob to around +40, and 
then release the mouse button.

 To create sudden breaks in an automation curve, double-click the param-
eter you’re automating (the Pan knob in this case) and type a new value. Then press 
Return when you want to record the new value on the automation track.
8	
After the playhead has moved past the end of the Vocoder region, Option-click the 
Pan knob.
The Pan knob returns to its center position, and the automation curve jumps to the 0 
value.

456    Automating the Mix
9	
Stop playback.
10	 On the Vocoder track header, set the automation mode to Read, and click the disclosure 
triangle to close the subtrack.
11	 Listen to the result.
In the build-up, the first two bars of vocals are to the left of the stereo field, and the 
last two bars are to the right. The vocals moving from left to right in the stereo field 
renew interest at bar 59, and add excitement to the section.
NOTE ▶ ​The Write automation mode is rarely used. It erases all automation data as 
the playhead passes it and records any new movements you make on the channel 
strip. It can be quite dangerous, as it even erases automation not currently displayed 
in the automation track.
Recording Plug-in Bypass Automation
Like a guitar player engaging a distortion pedal to play a solo, you’ll sometimes want to 
apply an effect plug-in to only specific sections of a song. Automating the plug-in bypass 
allows you to turn the effect on and off at specific positions.
You will now add an EQ plug-in to a vocal track, choose a telephone EQ setting, and then 
automate the bypass of the EQ plug-in so it’s turned on only during the first breakdown.
1	
Select the Vocoder Chorus track (track 28).
2	
Zoom in on the first Vocoder Chorus on the track (at bar 29) to view the entire 
Breakdown 1 marker.
You can see the volume automation curve you created earlier in this lesson.

Recording Live Automation    457
3	
In the Inspector, on the Vocoder Chorus channel strip, click below the last plug-in in 
the Audio FX area, and choose EQ > Channel EQ.
4	
In the Channel EQ plug-in window, from the Settings menu, choose EQ Tools > 
Phone Filter Wide Band.
Look at the EQ curve. This setting emphasizes mid frequencies while drastically cut-
ting high and low frequencies to simulate the sound of a voice through a telephone. 
You will apply this telephone effect to the Breakdown 1 section. Because the track has 
no previous regions, the EQ can be turned on from the beginning of the song until 
the end of the breakdown when you will bypass it.
5	
In the Vocoder Chorus track header, set the automation mode to Latch.
6	
Start playback before the Breakdown 1 marker.

458    Automating the Mix
7	
At the very end of the breakdown (at bar 33), click the Channel EQ power button to 
turn it off.
On the track header, the Automation Parameter pop-up menu displays the Insert #7 
Bypass parameter, and on the track, the plug-in is bypassed (turned off) at the end of 
the breakdown.
If you are not happy with the timing of the Bypassed control point, you can zoom in 
and drag it to adjust its position.
8	
Stop playback.
9	
On the Vocoder Chorus track header, set the automation mode to Read.
10	 Listen to the result.
The vocoded vocal has a narrow band of frequencies during the breakdown, then the 
Channel EQ is turned off at bar 33 and the vocoded vocal has a full frequency range 
sound throughout the rest of the song.
11	 Close the Channel EQ plug-in, and zoom out.
Using MIDI Controllers
Recording live automation by dragging onscreen sliders and knobs with the mouse can be 
a powerful means of expression, but nothing beats the feel of a real fader or knob under 
your fingers. Adding a control surface to your Logic setup allows you to map different 
knobs to the desired channel strip or plug-in parameters to remotely control those param-
eters to record live automation.
www.ebook3000.com

Using MIDI Controllers    459
Many supported control surfaces (such as the Logic Remote) are automatically detected by 
Logic, which also will automatically assign their faders and knobs.
MORE ​INFO ▶  ​To learn more about supported control surfaces, choose Help > Logic 
Pro Control Surfaces Support.
When the controls are not automatically mapped—for example, when control knobs are 
used on a MIDI keyboard that isn’t a supported device—you can manually assign the 
physical knobs to the parameters you want to automate.
NOTE ▶ ​If your control surface is a MIDI keyboard that does not have a controller 
knob of any kind, you can use the modulation wheel to perform the following exer-
cise. Any device sending MIDI CC events can be assigned to any channel strip or 
plug-in parameter.
Using Automation Quick Access
Automation Quick Access allows you to assign a single controller knob to the automation 
parameter that is currently displayed on the selected track. You need to assign the controller 
knob only once, and you can then use it to control any parameter on any track. Just select a 
track and choose the desired parameter from the Automation Parameter pop-up menu.
In this exercise, you will slowly fade out the entire song at the end. To record automation 
curves for the Output channel strip, you must first create a track for that channel strip.
1	
In the Inspector, Control-click the Output channel strip, and from the shortcut menu, 
choose Create Track.
An Output track appears at the bottom of the list in the Tracks area.

2	
In the Output track header, from the Automation Parameter pop-up menu, choose 
Volume.
The Track Automation button is automatically turned on.
3	
Choose Logic Pro X > Preferences > Automation (or press Option-A).
4	
At the bottom of the Automation window, turn on Automation Quick Access.
 To turn on Automation Quick Access, you can also choose Mix > Enable 
Automation Quick Access.
An alert message asks you to assign a controller to Automation Quick Access.
5	
Click Assign.
6	
On your MIDI controller, turn a knob all the way up then all the way down.
In the Inspector, the Output Volume fader moves accordingly.
7	
Turn the controller knob back up so that the Output is set to 0 dB.
8	
Close the Automation preferences window.
9	
In the Output track header, set the automation mode to Latch.

10	 Start playback at the beginning of Chorus 3 (at bar 105).
11	 Slowly turn down the knob on your controller to record a slow fade-out throughout 
the Chorus 3 section.
The controller knob allows you to remotely control the Output channel strip Volume 
fader and record its automation. From now on, you can select any track, and the 
controller knob you assigned to Automation Quick Access can control the parameter 
selected in that track’s Automation Parameter pop-up menu.
12	 Set the Output track’s automation mode to Read.
13	 Select the Guitar Solo track (track 17).
14	 In the Guitar Solo track header, from the Automation Parameter pop-up menu, 
choose Main > Pan.
15	 On your MIDI controller, turn the controller knob assigned to Automation Quick 
Access up and down.
The knob now controls the Pan knob on the Guitar Solo track. Feel free to set the 
track to the Touch or Latch mode, start playback at the beginning of the Guitar Solo

section (at bar 97), and then turn the knob to automate the position of the guitar solo 
in the stereo field. Make sure that you set the Automation Mode pop-up menu back 
to Read when you’re finished.
You are now done automating this project so you can hide all the automation curves.
16	 In the Tracks area menu bar, click the Automation button to disable it.
In the workspace, all the automation tracks are hidden, and on the track headers, the 
Automation button and menus disappear.
Using knobs on a control surface to tweak plug-in parameters in real time can be a lot of 
fun as you discover new ways to “play” the plug-ins as musical instruments. Make sure 
that you keep this technique in mind when you feel an instrument or a section of a song is 
a little static or repetitive and could benefit from automation.
Bouncing the Mix
In Lesson 1, you exported a finished mix to an MP3 file. To come full circle, in this final 
lesson, you will bounce your automated mix at the highest quality available: an uncom-
pressed PCM file.
First, you will zoom out so that you can see the entire song in the workspace.
1	
Click the background of the workspace, and press Z to view the entire song.
Note where the last regions end at bar 114. When you are not sure of the exact end of 
a song, zoom in on the end of the last regions, and play the final few bars. Sometimes 
effect plug-ins such as reverberation and delay still produce sound long after the end 
of the song!
2	
Choose File > Bounce (or press Command-B) to open the Bounce dialog.
3	
In the Destination column, ensure that PCM is selected, and enter 114 in the End field.
www.ebook3000.com

Bouncing the Mix    463
Leave the Mode set to Offline. 
While Realtime mode lets you hear your song while it’s bouncing in real time, Offline 
mode takes advantage of your CPU to complete the operation as fast as your Mac can 
process it, which can save a lot of time. 
The Normalize function automatically adjusts the level of the file so that it peaks at 
or below 0 dBFS. If you have used mastering plug-ins to ensure that the Output peak 
meter peaks at 0 dBFS, you do not need Normalize.
4	
Set Normalize to Off.
Leave all the PCM parameters (to the right) set to their default values.
▶
▶The File Format choices—AIFF, Wave, and CAF—all produce the same sound 
quality. (Each has its own features, as discussed in Lesson 2, “Choosing the 
Recording File Type.”) The File Format you choose depends mostly on which for-
mat is needed for further processing, such as mastering. 
▶
▶The (bit depth) Resolution is set to 24 Bit, which is the best sound quality.
▶
▶The Sample Rate is set by default to the project sample rate. You should change 
this only if you want to convert the bounced file to a new sample rate.
▶
▶The File Type is Interleaved, which is the most common file type used.

464    Automating the Mix
▶
▶Dithering can make a subtle difference in very quiet sections of a song, or when a 
song is fading in or out. It is recommended to dither only once and at the very end 
of the production of a song, so leave it off if you intend to have the song mastered. 
▶
▶When you select “Add to Project,” the bounce file is added to the Project Audio 
Browser.
5	
Click Bounce.
A Bounce Output 1-2 dialog opens, and you can choose a filename and a location for 
the bounced file.
6	
Name the file Alliance (the name of the song), press Command-D to save it to the 
desktop, and click Bounce.
A progress window appears, and in the Tracks area, you can see the playhead move 
faster than real time as the bounced file is created.
When the progress window disappears, your bounced file is ready.
7	
Press Command-Tab to go to the Finder.
8	
In the Finder, choose Finder > Hide Others (or press Command-Option-H).
9	
On your desktop, click Alliance.aif, and press the Spacebar to play the final version of 
the song.

Lesson Review    465
Using automation, you have taken your song to a new level, adjusting the volume and 
adding EQ automation to vocoded vocals to change their sounds in different sections. 
You have drawn offline automation on the track, and recorded live automation using both 
the mouse and a control surface. Let your imagination run wild, and try to think of other 
applications to automate your own projects.
Lesson Review
1.	 How can you create a control point on the automation curve?
2.	 How can you create a control point away from the automation curve?
3.	 How can you quickly adjust the value of a parameter for a given section of a track?
4.	 How can you trim an automation curve?

Although Logic includes a wide array of software instruments and sup-
ports third-party Audio Units software instruments, you may some-
times want to use Logic to trigger a hardware synthesizer or sampler, or 
even a software instrument in another software application.
In the following exercises, you will set up hardware instruments to 
access them from Logic, first using the External Instrument plug-in on 
a software instrument track, then using external MIDI tracks to route 
MIDI events to a MIDI instrument outside of Logic. You can then 
record on external MIDI tracks using the same recording techniques 
you use with software instrument tracks. An external MIDI track can be 
routed to a hardware MIDI device or to any MIDI-compatible applica-
tion available on your computer or network.
Using External  
MIDI Devices
Appendix A

470    Using External MIDI Devices 
Using the External Instrument Plug-in
When you want to quickly access an external MIDI instrument, you can use the External 
Instrument plug-in, which allows you to treat the external device as a software instrument 
plug-in.
The External Instrument plug-in is inserted in the Instrument slot of a software instru-
ment channel strip. It routes the MIDI data coming from the track to an external MIDI 
destination you choose in the plug-in, and routes the incoming audio data from the device 
back to the software instrument channel strip’s Instrument slot. The audio data can be 
processed by audio effect plug-ins in the Audio FX section and routed to a destination in 
the Logic mixer.
In the following exercise, you’ll use the External Instrument plug-in to route MIDI notes to 
an external synthesizer, and route the audio from the synthesizer back to the Logic Mixer.
1	
Choose File > New. In the New Tracks dialog, choose Software Instrument, and click 
Create.
2	
On the Inst 1 channel strip in the Inspector, click the Instrument slot, and choose 
External Instrument.
A stereo External Instrument plug-in window opens. The MIDI Destination determines 
where Logic routes the MIDI events from the track; they can be routed to a synthesizer 
or sampler connected to your Mac with a USB cable, or the MIDI Out port number of a 
USB MIDI interface. In the latter case, make sure that the MIDI Out port is connected 
to the MIDI In port on the synthesizer.
3	
In the External Instrument plug-in, select the MIDI Destination.
www.ebook3000.com

Using the External Instrument Plug-in    471
NOTE ▶ ​By default, the External Instrument plug-in routes the MIDI events to all 
MIDI channels. If you need to send a specific channel, you can choose one from the 
MIDI Channel pop-up menu. 
To route the audio from the external synthesizer, you need to connect a cable from its 
audio outputs (two audio outputs for a stereo synthesizer) to instrument audio inputs 
on your audio interface. You can then select those audio inputs in the External Instru-
ment plug-in.
4	
From the Input pop-up menu, choose the audio interface inputs to which you’ve con-
nected your synth.

472    Using External MIDI Devices 
In Logic Pro X, any incoming MIDI data is routed to the record-enabled track in 
the Tracks area. That data (or, upon playback, MIDI data contained in MIDI regions 
on the track) is passed on to the External Instrument plug-in, which routes it to the 
selected MIDI Destination. As the MIDI events reach your synth, they trigger the 
synth’s sound to produce an audio signal. That audio signal is routed back to the 
External Instrument plug-in and can be processed and routed by the channel strip as 
with any software instrument.
NOTE ▶ ​Some synthesizers have a built-in audio interface. To use the synth’s audio 
interface, select the synth as an Input Device in Logic Pro X > Preferences > Audio, 
under the Devices tab. The synth audio outputs are then available in the External 
Instrument’s Input pop-up menu.
Configuring MIDI Hardware
Logic can identify by name any device that has been configured in Audio MIDI Setup, a 
Mac OS X configuration tool. Audio MIDI Setup automatically detects USB- or FireWire-
connected MIDI devices on your Mac, provided that the necessary drivers are properly 
installed.
However, MIDI synthesizers connected to a MIDI interface are not automatically 
detected. You can set up those synths in Audio MIDI Setup. Once that is done, you can 
access them by name in Logic, so you needn’t remember which device is connected to 
which port on the MIDI interface.
For the purposes of this exercise, we will set up two external synthesizers in Audio MIDI 
Setup, connected to the Mac via a USB MIDI interface.
1	
Open a Finder window.
The Finder is the active application, and its name is displayed to the right of the Apple 
menu in the main menu bar.
2	
Choose Go > Utilities (or press Command-Shift-U) to open the Utilities folder.
3	
Double-click Audio MIDI Setup.
Audio MIDI Setup opens, and by default, the Audio window opens.

Choose Window > Show MIDI Window.
Connected MIDI device
Disconnected MIDI device
You should see an IAC Driver icon, a Network button, and icons for any MIDI 
devices connected directly to your computer. Devices that were previously, but not 
currently, connected to your Mac are represented by dimmed icon.
NOTE ▶ ​If a device connected to your Mac does not appear in Audio MIDI Setup, 
make sure that you have properly installed the most recent driver for that device.
You can double-click the Network icon to create network MIDI ports, virtual MIDI 
cables that allow you to connect applications over a wired or wireless network. Exist-
ing network MIDI ports are displayed in the Logic Library when an external MIDI 
track is selected.
You can double-click the IAC Driver icon to create Inter-Application Communication 
buses, virtual MIDI cables that allow you to connect applications on your computer. 
Existing IAC buses are displayed in the Logic Library when an external MIDI track is 
selected.
Let’s create an icon to represent the two synths connected to the MIDI interface.
5	
Click the Add Device button.
A new external device is created.

474    Using External MIDI Devices 
6	
Click the Add Device button again.
A second new external device is created.
7	
Double-click the first new device.
A Properties window appears.
8	
In the Device Name field, enter Synthesizer 1 (or an appropriate name to designate 
your first synth).
9	
Click Apply to rename the device.
www.ebook3000.com

Configuring MIDI Hardware    475
10	 Close the Synthesizer 1 Properties window.
11	 In the Audio MIDI Setup window, double-click the second device to open its Proper-
ties window.
12	 In the Device Name field, enter Synthesizer 2.
13	 Click Apply, and close the Properties window.
Now you need to identify the physical connections between the MIDI interface and 
the synthesizers in Audio MIDI Setup. Because Logic routes all incoming MIDI 
events to the record-enabled track, you need only to route outgoing MIDI events. For 
this exercise, let’s assume you have a MIDI interface with the following physical MIDI 
connections:
▶
▶MIDI interface MIDI Out port 1 connects to the Synthesizer 1 MIDI In port.
▶
▶MIDI interface MIDI Out port 2 connects to the Synthesizer 2 MIDI In port.
You will now enter these connections in Audio MIDI Setup. Feel free to scroll or 
resize the MIDI window, and to drag the icons representing your MIDI devices to 
new locations to make it easier for you to connect them.
14	 Click the MIDI Out port 1 of the MIDI interface, and drag the cable to the MIDI In 
port of Synthesizer 1.

476    Using External MIDI Devices 
15	 Click the MIDI Out port 2 of the MIDI interface, and connect it to the MIDI In port 
of Synthesizer 2.
You have now connected the devices in Audio MIDI Setup.
16	 Choose Audio MIDI Setup > Quit Audio MIDI Setup (or press Command-Q).
Audio MIDI Setup now knows which MIDI Out port is connected to which device, and 
the Logic Library will display the Synthesizer 1 and Synthesizer 2 device names you previ-
ously entered, replacing MIDI interface Port 1 and MIDI interface Port 2.
NOTE ▶ ​If you want to record or monitor the audio outputs from the hardware syn-
thesizers in Logic, you must also connect the synthesizers’ audio outputs to audio 
inputs on your audio interface. In Logic, record-enable an audio track to record or 
monitor those audio inputs. Make sure that you have chosen the desired input num-
ber in the input slot of the I/O section on the audio track’s channel strip.
Routing External MIDI Tracks
When using external MIDI tracks, you route the MIDI events on the track via the Library. 
All the devices set up in Audio MIDI Setup appear in the Library (including IAC buses and 
network MIDI ports), along with all the ReWire applications installed on your computer.
In the next exercise, you will use the Library to choose a destination for an external 
MIDI track.
www.ebook3000.com

Configuring MIDI Hardware    477
1	
Open a new Empty Project template, and in the New Tracks dialog, choose External 
MIDI as the Type. In the Details area, leave “Use External Instrument plug-in” dese-
lected, set Output to Off, and then click Create.
A new external MIDI track is created.
2	
In the control bar, click the Library button (or press Y).
The Library displays all the available MIDI destinations for the external MIDI track. 
(The available destinations depend on your studio setup.)
▶
▶The GM (General MIDI) device is a multi-timbral instrument that always sends 
to all existing MIDI Out ports. A multi-timbral instrument is one that can 
respond to more than one MIDI channel at a time to play several sounds (more 
commonly called patches or programs) simultaneously. A single MIDI port can 
transmit 16 MIDI channels simultaneously, and each MIDI channel can play 
one program. The 16 MIDI channels of the GM device are displayed in the right 
column.
▶
▶The Synthesizer 1 and 2 you configured in Audio MIDI Setup are displayed in the 
list of available MIDI destinations.
▶
▶The MIDI output ports of any connected USB MIDI interface that aren’t cabled 
into a device in Audio MIDI Setup.
▶
▶The virtual MIDI input ports of any MIDI synth or sampler connected to your Mac 
with a USB cable.
You will now assign the selected track to MIDI channel 1 of Synthesizer 1.
NOTE ▶ ​If you do not have an external MIDI synthesizer or sampler, in the next step 
choose GM Device instead of Synthesizer 1, then follow along with the steps, but keep 
in mind you won’t hear any sound because no external instrument is connected.

478    Using External MIDI Devices 
3	
In the Library, select Synthesizer 1, and in the right column, select Channel 1.
While the track is record-enabled, any incoming MIDI events will be routed to the 
track. The track header displays the name of the MIDI destination (Synthesizer 1), 
and the MIDI Channel (1).
In the Inspector, the Arrange channel strip appears, but does not look like the audio and 
software instrument channel strips. Because the external MIDI channel strip generates 
MIDI events, it does not have processing plug-in inserts or audio routing settings.
External MIDI channel strip
The Volume fader and the knobs on the external MIDI channel strip send MIDI con-
tinuous controller events to the external MIDI instrument. Those events allow you to 
www.ebook3000.com

Configuring MIDI Hardware    479
remotely control the external instrument’s volume, pan position, and other param-
eters of the program on that MIDI channel, provided that these parameters are imple-
mented on the external MIDI instrument.
Choosing a Program Remotely
Logic allows you to remotely choose a program or patch on your external MIDI device, 
which avoids interrupting your Logic workflow, and also allows you to save the programs 
used on each track in your Logic project file.
1	
On the track header, double-click the instrument icon.
The Synthesizer 1’s Multi-Instrument window appears.
NOTE ▶ ​The GM Device Multi-Instrument window contains the General MIDI 
program names.
To transmit program change events from Logic to your synth, you need to select the 
Program parameter for the track.
2	
Open the Track inspector, and select the Program checkbox.

480    Using External MIDI Devices 
In the Tracks area, the track header displays the program number, and the corre-
sponding program change event (program 0) is sent to your synth.
3	
In the Synthesizer 1 Multi-Instrument window, click a program name.
The corresponding program-change MIDI event is sent to the external MIDI instru-
ment. (In the control bar, if you choose the custom LCD display, you can see the 
program-change event on the MIDI Out activity display.) When you play your MIDI 
keyboard, you will hear the new sound.
Most instruments have more than 128 programs. To access additional programs, you 
need to switch to another bank of programs.
4	
Click the Bank menu, and choose 1.
An alert message appears, asking if you want to initialize the bank.
5	
Click Initialize.
www.ebook3000.com

Configuring MIDI Hardware    481
Choosing a bank from the Bank menu sends a bank select MIDI event to the external 
MIDI instrument that instructs it to switch to the new bank. If your instrument does 
not react to the bank select event, try choosing another type of bank select event for 
that instrument in the Bank Message menu (below the Bank menu).
You can name all the programs for your instruments and save the project as a template 
so that you can choose programs by name, rather than by number.
6	
Double-click the first program number, type a name for the first program, and press 
Return.
 You could repeat this process until you’ve named all the programs in all the 
banks, but that could take some time! Instead, search a website devoted to Logic 
users for a Logic project file in which the desired hardware instruments have already 
been configured.
If you can’t find a Logic template, look online for an electronic voice list, usually in 
PDF format (and sometimes part of the electronic manual, so start your search with 
the instrument manufacturer’s website). Copy and paste the list of program names for 
your MIDI device into a text editor (such as Apple TextEdit) and edit it to create a list 
of 128 names, one per line. Copy all 128 names, and in Logic, at the upper right of the 
Multi-Instrument window, from the Options menu, choose Paste All Names. Repeat 
the process for each program bank.

482    Using External MIDI Devices 
When you are done entering program names for all your instruments, you should 
save your work. Program names are saved in the project file, not as a general prefer-
ence; so, unless you save the project, all your program names will be lost. To avoid 
that, let’s save this project as a template.
7	
Choose File > Save As Template.
A Save As dialog appears, and the location is already set to the Project Templates 
folder. All you need to do is name your template.
8	
Name and save your template.
Your new template will be available in the Templates dialog that appears when you 
choose File > New from Template (or press Command-N), in the My Templates col-
lection folder.
