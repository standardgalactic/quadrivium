About the Author,
Margaret Kerr and JoAnn Kurtz first met when they were junior 
lawyers in a law firm. Because their offices were side by side, they 
were frequently to be found carrying on entertaining and often 
risqué conversations, especially whenever the senior partner 
walked by. When Margaret and JoAnn left the firm to pursue other 
opportunities (as they say), it looked like the perfect co-authorship 
was ended before it even started.
During their years apart, JoAnn ran a general law practice and 
started a family, while Margaret practised in the areas of legal 
research and civil litigation and honed her equestrian skills. They 
met again by chance when they were both teaching in the Bar 
Admission Course, each having discovered a taste for inflicting 
information about law on innocent minds. JoAnn suggested that 
Margaret join her in teaching law at a community college and the 
two were briefly reunited under one roof.
Now co-authorship could not be held off by fate any longer. One 
day JoAnn’s husband said to JoAnn and Margaret, “You two could 
write a book about buying a home.” “Of course we could,” they 
said, tossing their heads, and they immediately did so. The 
Complete Guide to Buying, Owning and Selling a Home in Canada 
(1997) became a Canadian bestseller.
Margaret and JoAnn made two strange discoveries after writing one 
book together — first, that they had fun writing as a team; and 
second, that writing books is addictive. The world just didn’t seem 
quite right without an editor demanding a complete manuscript 
exactly when JoAnn was experiencing a major family crisis or 
Margaret was away on business. So they started churning out 
books, together, alone, and with others: Make It Legal: What Every 
Canadian Entrepreneur Needs to Know About the Law; Facing a Death 
in the Family; Canadian Tort Law in a Nutshell (with Larry Olivo); 
Legal Research Step by Step (with Arlene Blatt); Family Law: Practice 
and Procedure (by JoAnn alone); Residential Real Estate Transactions 
(by JoAnn with Joan Emmans and Arlene Blatt); and Advocacy for 
Paralegals (by JoAnn with Arlene Blatt).
The Canadian media couldn’t help noticing the deluge of books, and 
JoAnn and Margaret have happily done numerous radio, TV, and 
newspaper interviews as well as author appearances.

Introduction
N
EWS FLASH: The end of the world is coming! Well, not the 
end of the entire world, just the end of your world. It’s prob-
ably not coming today, and it’s probably not coming tomorrow or 
even next week. But the nasty truth is that we’re all going to die 
some day. We usually can’t tell very far ahead what day our world 
will end. But we can plan ahead against that day.
About This Book
When we go, we can’t take anything with us. Our possessions stay 
behind. They may as well stay with people we choose rather than 
go to people the provincial government chooses or be spent on 
government taxes and fees that could (at least in part) be avoided.
This book will tell you how to plan for the end of life by creating 
an estate plan, making a will, and making a power of attorney and 
living will.
This book is designed to be used as a reference, and you don’t 
need to read it in any particular order. You can dip into a chapter 
here and a chapter there if you like. On the whole, though, you’ll 
probably get more out of this book if you start at the beginning, 
proceed to the middle, and continue on to the end (although not 
all in one sitting).
We don’t expect you to remember anything from one chapter to 
the next — we always refresh your memory as necessary.
What You Don’t Have to Read
You don’t have to read chapters that you think are unimportant 
to you. If you don’t have children, you could skip the chapter on 
making arrangements for your children to be looked after following 
your death. If you don’t own a business, you could skip the chapter 
on passing on your business.
You also don’t have to read any text preceded by the Technical 
Stuff icon in order to understand what we’re talking about.

Foolish Assumptions
This book was written for people who aren’t lawyers or accoun-
tants or insurance brokers or financial planners but who want 
to know how to plan their estate and make their will. We don’t 
assume that you have any background knowledge about law or 
income tax or insurance policies or funeral planning or anything 
else. We start at the beginning of each subject and build up infor-
mation about it. We avoid using technical language when it’s not 
necessary, and we explain technical terms in plain English if you 
need to know them.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts, each covering a major area 
of estate planning. The chapters within each part cover specific 
topics in detail.
Part I: Estate Planning Basics
In this part you’ll find the basic information you need to under-
stand the estate planning process. In Chapter 1 we explain what 
your estate is, and what estate planning is and why you need to 
do it. In Chapter 2 we tell you how to prepare an inventory of your 
estate. In Chapter 3, probably the scariest part of this book, we tell 
you about the Canadian tax system and the impact of the federal 
Income Tax Act on estate planning. But don’t worry, we also tell 
you how to work with the income tax rules to keep taxes on your 
estate as low as possible. Then, as a bonus, we explain what pro-
bate fees are and offer some strategies for keeping them down too. 
Part II: Estate Planning Tools
In Part II we introduce you to the tools commonly used to plan 
an estate. Chapter 4 helps you figure out whether you need life 
insurance and, if you do, how much; and gives you the information 
you need to decide which kind of life insurance is right for you. In 
Chapter 5 we talk about giving away your property before you 
die, and explain why there is no such thing as a simple gift. In 
Chapter 6 we talk your ear off about testamentary trusts and living 
trusts. In case you just can’t wait — trusts are a way to give prop-
erty away while still keeping some control over it.

 Introduction
3
Part III: Creating an Estate Plan
In Part III we start to take you through the estate planning pro-
cess. Chapter 7 assists you in choosing the people you’ll give your 
estate to (your beneficiaries) and the person who will manage 
your estate until it has been completely given away (your execu-
tor). In Chapter 8 we let you know what will happen to your young 
children if you die before them and how to make the best advance 
arrangements for their care. In Chapter 9 we explain what you have 
to do to pass your business on to family members or other people 
of your choosing. Chapter 10 helps you decide whether to give a 
gift to charity and when to do it (while you’re alive or in your will). 
Chapter 11, destined to become a cult classic, gives you the low-
down on planning your funeral and donating your organs.
Part IV: Putting Your 
Plan into Action
In Part IV we get down to the nitty-gritty of estate planning — 
creating the documents required to carry out the plan you’ve 
worked so hard on. In Chapter 12 we set out all the unpleasant 
things that will happen if you don’t make a will, and in Chapter 13 
we actually show you a will, in all its glory, and tell you all the 
things that can go wrong if your will isn’t done right. In Chapter 14 
we talk to you in our perky way about making arrangements to 
manage your finances if you become disabled before you die; and in 
Chapter 15 we cover arrangements to manage your physical care if 
you become unable to make decisions. In Chapter 16 we take a little 
pity on you and tell you how to get help with all the things we’ve 
told you you’d better do if you know what’s good for you.
Part V: Readying Your Estate 
and Keeping it Up to Date
Just when you think it must surely be all over by now, along comes 
Chapter 17. In that chapter we encourage you to put your affairs in 
order so you won’t drive your executor to an early grave or make 
your estate impossible to manage. It’s at this point that you’ll prob-
ably want to throw the book through a plate glass window. But if 
you resist that impulse in Chapter 17, you’ll almost certainly give 
in to it in Chapter 18, where we cheerily tell you that the only way 
to avoid going through the whole estate process again . . . maybe 
many times . . . is to die as soon as you’ve made your first estate 
plan and signed your first will.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
In Chapter 19 we build on our advice in Chapter 16 and suggest 
ten questions for you to ask a lawyer before you hire him or her. 
In Chapter 20 we offer ten tips for using the Internet in the estate 
planning process.
Icons
We use a number of icons in this book to guide you to information 
that’s particularly important or useful . . . or in one case, that’s par-
ticularly easy to ignore.
 
This icon draws your attention to important information that 
you’ve probably already forgotten if we told you about it before or 
that we want you to remember in the future.
 
This one reminds you that there are some things you mustn’t do 
without getting professional help from a lawyer.
 
And this one lets you know it’s probably safe to jump to the next 
paragraph, especially if your eyes are already glazing over from 
reading the paragraph that came before. But seriously, if you’re 
really interested in understanding the topic you should read these 
detailed definitions and explanations.
 
This icon alerts you that we’re saying something that could save 
you time, trouble, or money. When we hit a bull’s-eye, it could save 
you all three.
 
This ominous icon suggests not very subtly that you’re heading for 
trouble and very possibly complete disaster if you don’t follow our 
advice to the letter.
Where to Go from Here
Estate planning and wills were not invented for controlling people 
who want to keep their hands on their property after they’re dead. 
(Well, they weren’t invented just for never-say-die controllers. . .) 
They were invented for people who want to make sure that, after 
their death, life goes on fairly smoothly — financially if not 
emotionally — for their family and friends.

Part I

In this part . . .
T
his part gently introduces you to estate planning. We 
hardly ask you to think about your approaching end 
at all! Instead we tell you exactly what estate planning is, 
help you fi gure out the present size of your estate, and 
explain how Canadian tax laws affect your estate plan.

H
ere’s the good news about estate planning: You have an 
estate! You don’t have to be a sports star or a computer 
maven, or to have inherited old family money to have an estate or 
to need to do estate planning.
Now for the bad news about estate planning: It forces you to think 
about death — and not just in an abstract philosophical kind of 
way. It forces you to think about your own death. You may not 
enjoy the estate planning process very much, but in this chapter 
we explain why you should do it even though it’s not a lot of fun. 
We’re going to ease you gently into estate planning. We’ll briefly 
discuss the main things you need to know, and then in the follow-
ing chapters we go into more detail.

Understanding What 
Your Estate Is
We keep talking about this estate of yours, but before you start 
wondering why the butler and chauffeur didn’t show up for work 
this morning, we’d better give you a little more detail about what 
your estate is.
Your estate is made up of everything you own. But in legal terms, 
your debts — everything you owe — are also part of your estate, 
because what you own must be used to pay off your debts when 
you die. (We show you how to take stock of your estate in 
Chapter 2.)
 
The things you own are referred to in law and accounting as your 
assets, and the debts you owe as your liabilities.
You need to take some other things into account when you’re 
estate planning, although they’re not technically part of your 
estate:
 
✓ Life insurance: If you have a life insurance policy, when you 
die either your estate or an individual (or individuals) you 
name as beneficiary, whichever option you have chosen, will 
receive the insurance proceeds. (We tell you more about 
insurance in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Pension plans: If you’re a member of an employee pension 
plan, your spouse or a person you name as beneficiary may 
be entitled to receive a pension after your death or to receive 
a one-time payment.
 
✓ Government benefits: Your spouse and/or children may be 
entitled to receive either a pension or a one-time payment 
from the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, Veterans 
Affairs Canada, or Workers’ Compensation after your death.
 
Besides being what you own and owe, your estate is also a legal 
being that comes into existence on your death. It has some of the 
same legal rights that you had when you were alive, such as the 
right to enter into contracts and to sue and be sued. It also has 
some of the duties you had, the principal one being the duty to 
pay income tax.

 Chapter 1: What Is Estate Planning, Anyway?

Discovering What Estate 
Planning Is
Estate planning is essentially two things: planning to build up cash 
and other property in your estate, and planning what you want to 
happen to that property after you die.
Estate planning isn’t rocket science, but it isn’t a one-step process 
either. To start planning your estate you need to have a clear idea 
about the following matters:
 
✓ What do you own and what do you owe?
 
✓ What ways can you find of owning more and owing less so 
that you have more to leave behind?
 
✓ Whom do you want to (or have to) provide for after you’re 
gone, and how much do they need?
 
✓ What are the best ways of providing for them?
You’re going to have to take a hard, cold look at your financial situ-
ation and your family relationships and obligations.
Estate planning is not a one-time exercise, either, unless you kick 
the bucket immediately after making your plan and putting it into 
effect. Whenever an exciting incident — like love, marriage, babies, 
divorce — occurs in your life you need to review your estate plan 
and make any changes that seem necessary.
Figuring Out Why You Need 
to Do Estate Planning
Here are the main reasons why you need to plan your estate. You 
want to make sure that when you die,
 
✓ You have done everything in your power to see that your 
family has enough money to manage without you — it takes 
planning to set aside and invest money for your family and to 
make sure that you have enough insurance (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ Your property goes to the people you want to have it — if you 
die without a valid will, the provincial government decides 
who gets your property based on rules set by provincial law, 
and it may well not go to the people you have in mind (see 
Chapter 12).

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
10
 
✓ A person you choose will look after your estate — without a 
valid will, there will be no executor named by you who will 
have the automatic right to look after your estate; instead, 
someone (usually a family member) will have to apply to the 
court to be appointed to look after it (see Chapter 12).
 
✓ You have a say in who will look after your children — if both 
you and the children’s other parent die, a will is the best way 
to let your surviving family and the courts know whom you 
would like to care for the children (see Chapter 8).
 
✓ Your debts can be paid with the least damage to your estate — 
if you make no plan for payment of your debts, there may not 
be enough cash available to pay them (see Chapter 13). If you 
leave no will, the person appointed to look after your estate 
will have to sell some of your property to get the necessary 
cash, without any guidance from you about what to sell and 
what to keep in order to give to a particular family member or 
friend.
 
✓ The capital gains taxes your estate has to pay will be as low 
as possible — when you die your estate is taxed as if you had 
sold everything you owned just before you died, and without 
proper tax planning the bill can be high (see Chapter 3).
 
✓ The probate fees your estate has to pay will be as low as 
possible — in almost all provinces probate fees are calculated 
according to how much your estate is worth; with advance 
planning you can reduce the value of your estate for probate 
purposes, and so reduce these fees (see Chapter 3).
 
✓ The future of any business you own has been looked after — 
you need to plan ahead, whether you want your business to 
carry on (who should look after it?) or whether you want it to 
be sold (how to get the most money for it?). (See Chapter 9.)
Here’s a final, even more morbid, reason to plan your estate. As 
part of the process you can let your family know what you’d like 
done with your body. (Oddly enough, your body is not part of your 
estate, unlike the other things that belonged to you when you were 
alive, it belongs to your executor or, if you have no executor, your 
closest relative.) You can make your wishes known about organ 
donation (yes or no) and funeral arrangements (plain oak casket or 
the King Tut special, burial or cremation, flowers or donations to 
a favourite charity), so that your family members don’t have to go 
through the stress of making choices they think you’d approve of, 
or maybe even end up fighting about.

 Chapter 1: What Is Estate Planning, Anyway? 11
Getting a Handle on Estate 
Planning Tools
When you know what your estate consists of and what you want to 
give to whom, you can choose some estate planning tools to help 
you do what you want.
These are the most commonly used estate planning tools:
 
✓ A will: A will is a written, signed, and witnessed document 
that states how you want your property to be given away after 
you die, and appoints an executor to look after your property 
and debts after your death. We strongly advise that you have 
a lawyer prepare your will. (We tell you more about wills in 
Chapters 12 and 13.)
 
✓ Gifts given during your lifetime: A gift is a transfer of all of 
your rights over a piece of property. (After you make a gift, 
you no longer have the right to hold on to the thing given or 
to sell it or to take it back from the person you gave it to or 
to leave it to another person in your will.) Giving a valuable 
gift usually has tax consequences for the giver. “Tax conse-
quences” is a fancy way of saying “tax payments”. We tell you 
more about gifts in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Trusts: A trust is another way to give property away during 
your lifetime. But instead of giving the property directly to 
the person you want to have the use of it (the beneficiary), 
you choose another person (a trustee) to hold and look after it 
for the use of the beneficiary. Why, you may be asking, would 
anyone want to do a weird thing like this? The main reason is to 
prevent the beneficiary from having total control of the prop-
erty (for example, if the beneficiary is a child, or mentally dis-
abled, or hopeless about business matters; or if you want one 
person to have use of the property in the short term but want a 
different person to become the owner of the property at a later 
date). Setting up a trust may have income tax benefits. If you 
decide to set a trust up, you’ll need a professional — an estates 
and trusts lawyer or a tax lawyer, to advise you and to do the 
paperwork. (For more on trusts, see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Joint ownership of property during your lifetime: Joint own-
ership while you’re alive allows you to control who gets the 
jointly owned property when you die. You can own property 
jointly with another person (or with other people) in all prov-
inces other than Quebec. All sorts of property (real estate, 
bank accounts, mutual funds, or other investments) can be 
owned in this way. When you die, your share in the property 

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
12
will automatically pass to the surviving owner without being 
mentioned in your will (although it doesn’t hurt to include a 
statement in your will that you want this to happen).
 
✓ Life insurance: Life insurance is a kind of bet that you make 
with an insurance company. You’re betting that you’ll die and 
the life insurance company is betting that you won’t. If the life 
insurance company loses, it has to pay up on the bet — that’s 
the proceeds of the policy. A life insurance policy will help 
you ensure that your family has enough money after you die 
to replace the income you will no longer be around to earn, 
or to help them pay off taxes or other debts without using up 
your estate. However, many insurance policies end when the 
insured reaches retirement age — in other words, just when 
your chance of winning starts to improve.
Knowing When You Should 
Make an Estate Plan
Most people put off estate planning because they don’t want to 
face the certainty of dying. Some people are even afraid that doing 
some estate planning makes them more likely to die. We can 
assure you that there is no cause-and-effect relationship between 
estate planning and death. There is however a cause-and-effect 
relationship between a lack of estate planning and wasted time, 
trouble, and aggravation for the people you care about.
 
You should make an estate plan as soon as you have any signifi-
cant property (and you care who’s going to get it) or as soon 
as anyone is financially dependent on you, whichever happens 
sooner. You are legally able to make a will when you’re quite 
young — as soon as you are 18 years old (even younger in some 
limited circumstances, as we explain in Chapter 13). Don’t assume 
that estate planning is something to do when you’re “old,” because 
you don’t have to be old to die.
Going through the estate planning process once is not the end of 
the matter. You will have to change your estate plan as changes 
occur
 
✓ In your personal life. You should review your estate plan if 
you marry. Have a look again if you have children and as they 
grow up, leave home, and start to earn their own living. Think 
about changing your will if your spouse or partner dies or if 
you divorce or even if you separate and meet someone new.

 Chapter 1: What Is Estate Planning, Anyway? 13
 
✓ In your business life. If you start a business either alone or 
with others, you should review your estate plan to make sure 
it deals with your business’s debts and with whether your 
business will fold or carry on under new management when 
you die.
 
✓ In your executor’s life. You may need to change your will if 
the person you have named as your executor is no longer will-
ing or able to take on those duties, or if you decide that you 
need someone with more sophisticated business or invest-
ment skills.
 
✓ In the value of your property. If the value of the property you 
own goes way up or down in value, you may want to make 
changes to your estate plan to deal with the change in the 
taxes your estate will have to pay and with the debts your 
estate may have. You may also want to re-think how you’ve 
divided up your property in your will if you’re trying to treat 
everyone equally.
 
✓ In the law. Between the time you plan your estate and the 
date you die there will almost certainly be changes to tax law, 
family law, and estate law that may require changes to your 
estate plan.
Looking After Your Needs
You’re not dead yet. When you put together your estate plan don’t 
get so carried away with looking after everybody when you’re dead 
that you forget to look after yourself while you’re still alive.
What if you build up your investments but never have any money 
for new clothes, a night out, or a vacation? Suppose you were to 
give your cottage to your children on the understanding that you 
had the use of it for a few weeks every year? How happy would 
you be if they squabbled with you about when it was your turn 
and when it was theirs? What if you made your unmarried signifi-
cant other a joint owner with you of the house you bought . . . only 
to find one day that significant other had run off with your best 
friend?
You must make sure that your plans leave you with enough money 
and property (and enough control over your money and property) 
to last you until you die.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
14
Planning in Case You Become 
Physically or Mentally Incapable
Now isn’t becoming incapable a cheery thought. But while you’re 
confronting your own mortality, you have to also think about the 
possible decline before your ultimate fall.
A complete estate plan includes a plan for any time during your life 
that you can’t manage your own financial affairs — not only if you 
get Alzheimer’s disease but if a car accident leaves you in a coma, 
or if you have an operation that puts you out of commission for 
even just a short time, or, on a happier note, if you’re spending two 
or three months in Florida during the winter and you want some-
one to be able to look after things while you’re away.
 
The tool used for managing financial matters is a power of attorney. 
A power of attorney is a written, signed, and witnessed document 
that gives the person of your choice (called an attorney in most 
provinces) authority to handle your legal and financial affairs.
You also have to think about what you want done if your health 
declines to the point that you are no longer able to make decisions 
about your own health care. When that happens, someone else 
has to make decisions on your behalf — but who do you want that 
someone to be? And what decisions do you want that person to 
make?
The tool used to deal with health matters is a living will, a writ-
ten document that sets out your wishes about your health care, 
and that appoints a person (family member or friend or anyone 
you wish) to make health care decisions if you become unable to 
make those decisions for yourself. If you don’t have a living will, 
provincial law tells doctors and hospitals which of your nearest 
and dearest they should turn to for instructions. First on the list 
is a spouse, then adult children, and so on. If you run out of close 
relatives, the doctors and hospitals may have to ask a government 
official what to do with you. Now there’s a frightening thought!
Getting Professional Help
Should you get professional help? In a word, yes! We want to make 
this very clear. Estate planning and will preparation are danger-
ous territory for the do-it-yourselfer. The law in these areas is very 
complicated.

 Chapter 1: What Is Estate Planning, Anyway? 15
 
If you make a mistake in preparing or signing your own will and 
power of attorney, they may not do what you want them to do, 
or, even worse, they may be totally invalid. And let’s not even 
think about what will happen if you make a mistake in planning to 
reduce the taxes on your estate.
But naturally you’re worried about the cost of professional help. 
Will you have anything left in your estate after you pay for it? 
Obviously cost will be related to the amount of work you want 
done. If you have a large estate and need to make complex arrange-
ments to reduce taxes, sure it will be expensive, but generally a 
will is a real bargain as far as legal services go.
Lawyers aren’t the only professionals who can help you in plan-
ning your estate. Although a lawyer (or, in Quebec and British 
Columbia, a notary) with experience in will preparation should 
always be used to draft the actual legal documents and can usually 
give you much of the estate planning advice that you need, other 
professionals, such as accountants and financial planners, can 
also help in the financial, investment, and tax-saving part of the 
planning process. You may also be able to get advice from people 
or institutions you may deal with while building or planning your 
estate, such as
 
✓ Insurance agents or brokers
 
✓ Trust companies or banks
 
✓ Stockbrokers and mutual fund agents or brokers
 
Even with professional help, the more you know the better. That’s 
where this book will come in handy. We’ll take you through the 
process of estate planning, financial planning, and preparing a will 
and other documents so that you can get the most out of your pro-
fessional advisers.

Chapter 2
What Are You Worth? 
Preparing an Inventory 
of Your Estate
In This Chapter
▶ Itemizing what you own
▶ Taking a look at what you owe
▶ Puzzling out your net worth
T
he first step in estate planning is to get a handle on what’s in 
your estate. That means looking at everything you own and 
everything you owe, as well as any life insurance, pension plans, 
or government benefits to which your estate may be entitled. After 
you’ve got those numbers, you can calculate your net worth.
Once you know where you stand, you can think about planning 
to increase the value of your estate. Doing that requires financial 
planning, which is not what this book is about. However, Personal 
Finance For Canadians For Dummies by Eric Tyson and Tony 
Martin (Wiley) is a good book on that subject.
Figuring Out What You Own
Make a list of everything you own and its value. You can be high-
tech or low-tech — use your computer and a personal finance pro-
gram or a plain piece of paper and a pencil. You may find Table 2-1 
helpful.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
18
Start the list with the things that are easiest to value:
 
✓ Bank accounts: Check your bankbook, most recent bank 
statement, or your bank or trust company Web site to find out 
what your current balance is.
 
✓ Guaranteed investment certificates: Look at the certificate to 
see how much you originally invested and call your bank or 
trust company or go its Web site to find out how much inter-
est has accumulated since that time.
 
✓ Government savings bonds: Look at the face amount and 
maturity date on the bond and call your bank or trust com-
pany to find out how much interest has accumulated since the 
bond was issued. (For Canada Savings Bonds you can check 
the CSB calculator on the Internet at www.csb.gc.ca.)
 
✓ Stocks, corporate bonds, and mutual funds: If you have a 
broker, you get an account statement monthly or (if you don’t 
do a lot of buying and selling) at the end of any month in 
which there’s been activity in your account. Ask for a state-
ment if you haven’t received one recently. If you don’t have 
a broker you can find out the value of publicly traded shares 
and bonds by checking the stock quotation pages in the busi-
ness section of your newspaper or a stock quotation Web site 
on the Internet.
 
✓ RRSPs: Call your bank, trust company, or other plan adminis-
trator, or check their Web site, for the current balance if you 
don’t get regular account statements.
 
✓ Life insurance policies: Call your insurance company or agent 
to see if you have the right to cash in any of your policies 
before you die (and if so, for how much right now).
 
✓ Employment pension plans: Ask your employer to give you a 
statement of the present value of your pension (it’s not neces-
sarily the same as the total of your contributions and your 
employer’s contributions plus interest).
 
✓ Money owed to you by others: If you are in business as a sole 
proprietor or as a partner in a firm, include the amounts of 
any bills you have sent to your clients or customers and that 
haven’t yet been paid (but you expect will be paid).

 Chapter 2: Preparing an Inventory of Your Estate 19
Then look at the things you own that you could sell if you needed 
to. Their value is the amount that a stranger who actually wants 
them would be willing to pay for them (this is called fair market 
value).
 
✓ Your home, cottage, or other real estate: Look at ads in the 
newspapers to see the asking price of properties similar to 
yours (the sale price may be higher or lower than that); or for 
a fee you can have a real estate agent or appraiser value your 
property.
 
✓ Cars, boats, or other vehicles: Check newspaper ads to see 
what a vehicle of your make, model, and year is selling for pri-
vately, or call a dealer. A dealer would likely offer you a lower 
price than a private buyer.
 
✓ Artwork and antiques: Visit art galleries or antique shows 
to find out how much similar items are selling for. You can 
consult a dealer about the value of your property, but a dealer 
will probably charge to give you a careful valuation.
 
✓ Jewellery: Browse around pawn shops or jewellery stores 
that sell estate jewellery to learn the resale value of your 
pieces, or ask a jeweller for an opinion (you might have to pay 
for anything more than a casual answer).
 
✓ Furniture and household contents: Go to second-hand shops 
to find out what your sofa, dining room table, and bedroom 
suite are worth on the open market.
 
✓ Your business, if you own one: Conservatively speaking, 
your business is worth at least as much as its parts (equip-
ment, inventory, accounts payable, property owned or leased, 
etc.) could be sold for. Estimate the fair market value of those 
parts. Your business may be worth more than the value of 
what it owns, if it has a fabulous reputation or a great location 
or an incredible client base. You would need to pay a business 
valuator to put a price on your business if it could be sold as 
a whole rather than sold off piece by piece. If your business 
is essentially you personally providing a service (say dress-
making or accounting), it may not be worth much to anyone 
but you.
You’ll quickly discover that you paid a lot more for your belong-
ings than you can hope to sell them for.

Figuring Out What You Owe
Your debts may be something you’d rather not think about. How 
much do you owe and to whom do you owe it? Table 2-2 will help 
make this job a bit easier.
Make a list of everyone you owe money to and the current balance 
that you owe in each case:
 
✓ Mortgages: Call your mortgage lender to find out your out-
standing principal balance.
 
✓ Car loans: Call the lender (bank or financing company) to find 
out the outstanding balance.
 
✓ Other personal loans: Again call the lender to find out your 
outstanding balance.
 
✓ Student loan: You may receive regular statements; if not, call 
the bank.
 
✓ Credit card balances: Check your most recent monthly 
statements.
 
✓ Outstanding income tax installments or arrears: Check your 
reminders from Canada Revenue.
 
✓ Real estate taxes: Look at your municipal tax bill for the total 
amount of your annual taxes (it will also show any outstand-
ing unpaid amount) and deduct any payments you’ve made, 
or phone your municipal tax department to check.

C
anada doesn’t have any “death taxes” or “inheritance taxes” 
(Yay!), but that doesn’t mean that Canadians don’t have to 
pay taxes following a death (Boo!). Taxes at death can be quite 
substantial, but with proper estate planning you can keep them to 
the minimum possible.
When you die, you may be gone . . . but you’re not forgotten by 
the tax authorities. Under income tax law, your estate is born as a 
brand-new taxpayer that comes into existence on the date of your 
death.
Your estate (via your executor) has to file estate tax returns annu-
ally, starting from the year in which death occurred until the year 
in which the last property of the estate is given out to the benefi-
ciaries. Filing has two purposes: to report income of the estate (so 
it can be taxed in the estate), and to give Canada Revenue informa-
tion about distributions of income from the estate to beneficiaries 
(so the income can be taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries).
Estates are taxed in much the same ways as individuals. So you 
have to know something about how individuals are taxed before 
we can tell you how estates are taxed.

Understanding Some 
Income Tax Basics
In this section we tell you briefly about
 
✓  Income and capital gains
 
✓  Calculation of taxable capital gains
 
✓  Calculation of taxable income
 
✓  Special rules for spouses
Income and capital gains
In Canada, individuals pay federal and provincial income tax on 
their income and on their capital gains. Examples of income are
 
✓ Salary or wages
 
✓ Commissions
 
✓ Tips
 
✓ Rental payments received
 
✓ Interest payments received
 
✓ Dividends on shares
 
✓ Profits from an unincorporated business
Capital gains are profits from the disposition (such as a sale or a 
gift) of capital property, which is property with a long-term value, 
such as
 
✓ Shares in a corporation
 
✓ Real estate (but not your principal residence, which is what 
your home usually is — we talk more your principal residence 
later in this chapter)
 
✓ Valuable art, jewellery, collectibles, or antiques
Income and capital gains are taxed differently. Income tax is cal-
culated on the full amount of an individual’s income. Capital gains 
tax is calculated on one-half (changed in 2000 from two-thirds) of a 
capital gain.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 25
Capital gains
We start with capital gains because tax on capital gains, rather 
than tax on income, is usually the big thing people have to worry 
about when they’re doing estate planning.
A taxpayer can make a capital gain by disposing of capital property 
for more than it cost, or have a capital loss by disposing of capital 
property for less than it cost. (We tell you later what you do with a 
capital loss.)
Calculation of taxable capital gains
It’s easiest to explain how to calculate a capital gain by starting 
with a sale of capital property. And in everyday life most capital 
gains arise from a sale. The amount of a capital gain on a sale is 
calculated by looking at two things:
 
✓ The cost of the capital property, which is the purchase price 
plus other costs of acquiring the property (such as legal fees, 
commissions, licensing fees, the cost of borrowing money to 
buy the property, and the cost of improving the property). 
The cost of capital property, once all of these things are taken 
into account, is called the adjusted cost base.
 
✓ The amount received on the sale of the capital property, 
which is the selling price minus the cost of selling the property. 
The cost of selling includes such things as repairs, advertising, 
legal fees, and commissions. This sale amount, once everything 
is taken into account, is called the adjusted sale price.
 
A capital gain (or capital loss) is the difference between the adjusted 
sale price and the adjusted cost base. If the adjusted sale price is 
higher than the adjusted cost base, you have a capital gain. If it’s 
lower, you have a capital loss.
Only a portion of any capital gain is taxable. That portion is added to 
your income and is taxed as part of your income at standard income 
tax rates. The portion has changed from time to time. Before 1972, 
capital gains weren’t taxable at all. Then for many years, one-half of 
a capital gain was taxable. More recently, three-quarters of a capital 
gain was taxable. But in the year 2000, the portion fell twice — first 
to two-thirds and then again to one-half. For capital gains made on 
or after October 18, 2000, one-half of any capital gain is your taxable 
capital gain, and is added to your income. If you made a capital gain 
before October 18, 2000, you should check with Canada Revenue to 
see what portion of the gain is taxable.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
26
(The calculation of the capital gain or loss is a bit more compli-
cated if you used the property for business purposes and claimed 
capital cost allowance — that’s depreciation, or a gradual loss in 
value — against the property. In that case you’ll need to talk to 
Canada Revenue or get advice from an accountant.)
For an illustration of how a capital gain is calculated, have a look at 
the sidebar “Emma has a capital gain.”
Emma has a capital gain
Emma started hitting the garage sales after she heard that a man in Moncton had 
bought a grimy old painting for $5 that turned out to be a Rembrandt worth $2.5 mil-
lion. At one sale she bought a box of costume jewellery for $50. Among the rings 
was a white stone in a really ugly setting. She took the ring to a jeweller, who told 
her that it was a one-carat diamond with a small chip in it. The jeweller thought 
the diamond would be worth about $2,000 without the chip. She paid the jeweller 
$250 to recut the stone to remove the chip. Three years later, Emma’s neighbour, 
John, got engaged to Emma’s sister, Isabella. (The match was set up by Emma.) 
John told Emma he was going to buy Isabella a nice ring. Emma mentioned that 
she had a good-sized diamond and asked John if he’d like to buy it. He agreed, on 
the condition that Emma have the stone properly appraised. So Emma went back 
to the jeweller and paid $75 to have the stone appraised. The appraisal certificate 
stated that the stone was worth $2,200. John paid the full $2,200.
Assuming that Emma reports a capital gain on her income tax form for the year, this 
is how she would figure it out:
 1. Adjusted cost base calculation
 
 Purchase price of the ring ($50) + Improvements to the ring ($250) = Adjusted 
cost base ($300)
 2. Adjusted sale price calculation
 
 Sale price ($2,200) – Cost of appraisal ($75) = Adjusted sale price ($2,125)
 3. Capital gain calculation
 
 Adjusted sale price ($2,125) – Adjusted cost base ($300) = Capital gain ($1,825)
 4. Taxable capital gain calculation
 
 Capital gain ($1,825) × 50% = Taxable capital gain ($912.50)
So Emma, as a law-abiding taxpayer, would put $912.50 on her income tax form 
as a taxable capital gain and would pay tax on that amount as part of her income.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 27
If it walks like a capital gain and it quacks 
like a capital gain . . .
In Emma’s case, we assumed that she got the capital gain by selling 
something she had bought. But you can also end up with a capital 
gain on capital property
 
✓ That you didn’t buy — that was given to you as a gift, that 
you inherited, or that you received as part of an employment 
package (such as shares or stock options).
 
✓ That you didn’t sell — that you gave away to someone as a 
gift or that you moved from an investment account into your 
Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP).
 
✓ That you own at the time you die — Canadian tax law makes 
the peculiar assumption that immediately before you die you 
dispose of all of your capital property (this is called a deemed 
disposition).
 
When you become the owner of property in a way other than 
buying it, tax law says that you acquired the property for its fair 
market value (the going price in the open market) on the day the 
property came into your possession.
When you give away capital property, tax law says that you are dis-
posing of the property at fair market value. Even though you’re not 
actually getting a cent for your property, you’re triggering a capital 
gain (or loss) that has to be reported in your income tax return for the 
year. And when that happens, you — or your estate, if you’re dead — 
have to come up with cash to pay the tax on the capital gain.
If you trigger a capital gain on property that you didn’t buy in the 
first place or sell in the second place, you have to find out what 
the fair market value of the property was when you got it and when 
you disposed of it. This is easy with publicly traded stocks, for 
example, because a broker can tell you what a stock was worth on 
any given day. But suppose that you inherited a cottage from your 
parents and then gave it to one of your children. With property like 
real estate, art, or jewellery, you have to get an expert’s appraisal 
of the value at the time of acquisition and/or disposal.
And now for a strange tax fact: If you’ve owned property for many 
years (shares in a corporation, or a family cottage, for example), for 
capital gains purposes you’re responsible for the increase in value 
of the property only since December 31, 1971. That’s because capital 
gains were not taxable in Canada before that date. As a result, owners 
of capital property don’t have to go back any further than that when 
they’re figuring out the adjusted cost base of their property.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
28
Capital gains tax and spouses
A taxpayer ordinarily has to pay capital gains tax whether the 
property is sold or given away, or “deemed” (by Canada Revenue) 
to have been disposed of, if the capital property has gone up in 
value. An exception is when a taxpayer transfers property to his or 
her spouse, in which case no capital gain is triggered.
Spouses, for tax purposes, are two people who live together in a 
conjugal (marriage-like) relationship and have done so continu-
ously for at least 12 months. They don’t have to be married to each 
other. The two people can be of the same sex.
When a taxpayer transfers property to a spouse, the spouse auto-
matically steps into the shoes of the taxpayer and takes over the 
original adjusted cost base of the capital property along with the 
property. It is as if the spouse acquired the property at the same 
time and for the same price as the taxpayer did. This is called a 
spousal rollover. There is an automatic rollover — of the property, 
you understand, not of the spouse — any time a taxpayer transfers 
property to a spouse during the marriage (or marriage-like rela-
tionship). When the spouse ultimately sells the property, he or 
she includes one-half of any capital gain, calculated using the 
original adjusted cost base, in his or her income. (Canada Revenue 
can attribute the capital gain back to the spouse who originally 
owned the property; in other words, make that spouse pay the 
capital gains tax.) A taxpayer who doesn’t think this whole idea 
of rollovers sounds like a heck of a lot of fun can choose not to 
have one.
Turn to the sidebar “David and Lisa roll over” to see how a spousal 
rollover works.
Capital losses
 
A taxpayer has a capital loss by disposing of capital property for 
less than it cost.
Question: You have to pay tax on one-half of a capital gain — but 
what do you do with a capital loss?
Answer: If you have a capital loss in the same year that you have a 
capital gain, you can deduct the capital loss from the capital gain 
before calculating your taxable capital gain. If your capital loss is 
more than your capital gain, you have taxable capital gains of zero 
in that year. However, you can use a capital loss to reduce only 

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 29
a capital gain in that year; you can’t use a capital loss to reduce 
income in that year. What you can do is carry any extra capital loss 
back to any of the preceding three years to reduce taxable capital 
gains you had earlier. You have to file a new return to get back 
tax you paid in the preceding year or years. If you still have any 
unused capital losses, you can carry them forward indefinitely.
David and Lisa roll over
David bought shares in a corporation and paid $100,000 for them. He also paid a 
commission of $2,000. Seven years later, he transferred the shares to his spouse, 
Lisa. At that time they were worth $135,000, but David didn’t ask Lisa to pay him 
anything. Two years later, Lisa sold the shares for $142,000 and paid a commission 
of $2,500. There was an automatic spousal rollover because David did not choose 
not to have the rollover. So — who pays tax, how much, and when?
 1.  David pays no tax at all when he transfers the shares to Lisa. The automatic 
spousal rollover that happened when David transferred to Lisa meant that no 
capital gain was triggered for David.
 2.  When Lisa sells the shares, David is not the owner of the shares. He won’t 
have any tax liability as long as Canada Revenue doesn’t decide to attribute the 
capital gain back to him (which it could do under certain circumstances that 
would take too long to explain here) and make him pay the taxes. Instead, Lisa 
pays tax when she sells the shares because she’s the owner of the shares.
But how much does she pay? How does she calculate the capital gain? First of all, 
Lisa’s cost of acquiring the shares, that is, her adjusted cost base, is not zero, even 
though she paid nothing for the shares. And it’s not $135,000, even though that was 
the value of the shares when she acquired them. Because of the spousal rollover, 
Lisa’s adjusted cost base is exactly the same as David’s. That’s the cost of the 
shares plus the cost of acquiring the shares (the commission), or $102,000.
Once you figure that out, the rest is easy. All you have to do is calculate Lisa’s 
adjusted sale price.
 
  
$142,000 – $2,500 = $139,500
Then subtract the adjusted cost base from the adjusted sale price to get the capital 
gain.
 
  
$139,500 – $102,000 = $37,500
Then you take one-half of the capital gain and plunk it onto the income tax return 
as the taxable capital gain.
 
  
$37,500 × 50% = $18,750

Part I: Estate Planning Basics

When’s a capital loss not a dead loss?
Special rules apply to capital losses in your last or terminal return. 
That’s the return filed by your executor for the tax year in which 
you die. In the terminal return, capital losses must first be used 
to reduce capital gains, but if any losses are left over they can be 
used in the following ways:
 
✓ First, to reduce your other income in the taxation year in 
which you die,
 
✓ Then, to reduce your other income in the taxation year before 
the year you die.
Taxable income
Although the calculation of capital gains is the most important 
stuff to know about if you’re estate planning, the rules about cal-
culation of taxable income have a bearing on RRSPs (registered 
retirement savings plans) and RRIFs (registered retirement invest-
ment funds) if they’re a part of your estate.
Calculation of taxable income
In the annual tax return, a taxpayer is required to list his or her 
income from all sources, including employment income or income 
from an unincorporated business, pension income, amounts with-
drawn from an RRSP or RRIF, benefits from various sources, invest-
ment income, and rental income. These different types of income 
are added together to arrive at the taxpayer’s total income.
Taxpayers are allowed certain deductions from their total income 
to arrive at their taxable income, the income on which federal and 
provincial income tax is calculated. Allowable deductions include 
the following:
 
✓ RRSP contributions
 
✓ Annual union or professional dues
 
✓ Attendant care expenses that allowed the taxpayer to earn 
income
 
✓ Certain child-care expenses
Tax brackets
Individual taxpayers don’t pay tax on their taxable income at one 
single rate. Instead, they can pay tax at up to four different federal 
rates (and even more provincial rates, depending on the province). 
As income increases, the percentage rate at which it is taxed also 
increases in steps or by brackets.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 31
It’s hard to generalize about the combined rate of federal and pro-
vincial tax, because provincial tax rates and brackets vary from 
province to province, and both federal and provincial rates change 
from time to time. Roughly speaking, as of 2009,
 
✓ If your taxable income is up to approximately $41,000, you’ll 
pay tax at a rate of about 25 percent (however, the basic 
personal exemption tax credit reduces the tax payable on 
approximately $10,000 of this amount to $0).
 
✓ If your taxable income is between approximately $41,000 and 
approximately $81,500, you’ll pay tax at a rate of about 25 per-
cent on taxable income up to $41,000 and at a rate of about 35 
percent on taxable income between $41,000 and $81,500.
 
✓ If your taxable income is between approximately $81,500 and 
approximately $126,000, you’ll pay tax at a rate of about 25 
percent on taxable income up to $41,000, at a rate of about 
35 percent on taxable income between $41,000 and $81,500, 
and at a rate of about 40 percent on taxable income between 
$81,500 and $126,000.
 
✓ If your taxable income is over approximately $126,000, you’ll 
pay tax at a rate of about 25 percent on taxable income up 
to $41,000, at a rate of about 35 percent on taxable income 
between $41,000 and $81,500, at a rate of about 40 percent on 
taxable income between $81,500 and $126,000, and at a rate of 
about 45 percent on taxable income over $126,000.
Keep in mind that these are very rough estimates. So don’t trust 
us, check the combined federal/provincial rate in your province.
Check out the sidebar “Maurice’s brackets” for an example of how 
tax brackets work.
Maurice’s brackets
Maurice is a stockbroker and cricket player with a taxable income of $130,000. 
From Canada Revenue’s point of view, his income is made up of several blocks of 
money — $41,000 + $40,500 + $44,500 + $4,000 (= $130,000 in total). On the first block 
of $41,000, he pays tax in his province at 25 percent ($6,350 when the basic personal 
exemption tax credit is figured in); on the second block of $40,500 he pays tax at 35 
percent ($14,175); on the third block of $44,500 he pays tax at 40 percent ($17,800); 
and on the last block of $4,000 he pays tax at 45 percent ($1,800).

Discovering How Your Estate 
Will Be Taxed
As we tell you at the beginning of this chapter, estates are taxed 
in much the same ways as individuals. Income and one-half of any 
capital gain are taxed at the personal income tax rates discussed 
in the section above on tax brackets. One big difference is that 
an estate cannot claim any personal tax credits, other than the 
charitable donation tax credit, and so always has a higher taxable 
income — and therefore pays more tax — than a living person with 
the same total income. However, income earned by the estate (say 
from investments or renting out property) that is paid out or due 
to be paid out to a beneficiary named in the will is not considered 
income of the estate but rather income of the beneficiary.
Here’s an example. Your mother, Matilda, left you corporate shares 
in a shady used car business started by her father. Your mother’s 
will directed that the shares are to be held in trust for you until 
you are 25 years old (you’re 21 now), and the executor is to pay 
you the dividends earned by the shares. The dividends are income 
earned by the estate. But because the dividends are to be paid to 
you, your mother’s estate is not taxed on the income; you are.
No capital gain or loss for an estate occurs when property is trans-
ferred from the estate to a beneficiary under the will or under the 
provincial law (the law of intestate succession) that comes into play 
when a person dies without leaving a valid will. That’s because the 
estate is deemed by Canada Revenue to have acquired the property 
of the person who died at its fair market value, on the day he or 
she died. (You may have been wondering who exactly was buying 
all your property when you were so busy immediately before your 
death selling it. Now you know.) At the same time, and somewhat 
confusingly, tax law also assumes that the person who died dis-
posed of his or her property on death directly to the beneficiaries.
Deciding What Your Tax Planning 
Goals Should Be
Let’s face it. If you had your way, you wouldn’t pay any taxes at all, 
ever. Unfortunately, the government frowns on this approach to tax 
paying. They call it tax evasion and send you to jail if they catch you 
doing it. Tax minimization, on the other hand, is perfectly legal. It’s 
not a crime to plan your affairs in such a way that you pay the least 
amount of tax legally possible. However, just because tax minimiza-
tion is legal doesn’t mean that the government likes it. So almost 

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 33
as fast as taxpayers and their advisers come up with ways to avoid 
paying taxes, the government changes the legislation to close the 
loopholes that let them do it. It’s an exciting cat and mouse game 
that makes tax planning quite the industry in Canada.
Now that we’ve told you that you can’t do what you really want 
to do, which is pay no taxes, what should your goals be if you’re 
going to do strictly legal tax planning? The usual goals in tax plan-
ning for estate purposes are to
 
✓ Pay as little tax as you legally can.
 
✓ Delay paying tax for as long as you legally can.
 
✓ Make sure that the taxes are the responsibility of the person 
you choose.
Sometimes achieving one goal means you can’t achieve another. 
For example, sometimes in order to pay less tax, you have to pay 
it sooner rather than later. Also, while these are the usual tax plan-
ning goals, they are not your only goals. You shouldn’t plan your 
estate just to avoid taxes. You must never lose sight of your other 
estate planning goals, which are (in case they’ve slipped what’s left 
of your mind after dipping into this chapter) to make sure that
 
✓ Your property goes to the people you want to have it.
 
✓ Your debts and taxes can be paid without selling property you 
would like your family to keep.
 
✓ Your family has enough money to manage after you die.
 
✓ You have enough money and property to last until you die.
Everyone’s goals will be a little different. The only thing everyone 
has in common is a need to know about tax law.
Considering Possible Tax 
Planning Strategies
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to tax planning for estate pur-
poses. Your situation is unique, so we can’t tell you how to plan 
your estate to avoid all tax possible. What we can and will do is tell 
you what kinds of strategies there are and what may happen if you 
decide to use a particular strategy.
In this section, we cover several strategies to avoid or delay paying 
taxes that knowledgeable people take into account.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
34
Leaving everything to your spouse
Our income tax laws are drafted in such a way that very few taxes 
are payable when you give money and property to your spouse. 
The big tax bill comes when you pass on your money and property 
to your children or grandchildren. As a result, leaving everything 
to your spouse is an effective way to delay paying tax.
On the other hand, you may be thinking about leaving some or all 
of your estate to your children, grandchildren, or others. So let’s 
look into the pros and cons of leaving property to your spouse.
Capital property
 
Your capital property (property with long-term value) is subject to 
capital gains tax. You are deemed by Canada Revenue to have sold 
all of your capital property for its fair market value just before you 
die (this is called a deemed disposition). If what you owned went up 
in value after you got it, your estate will have a capital gain, one-
half of which is taxable.
This rule about your capital property does not apply to any prop-
erty that you leave to your spouse in your will. Instead, there is an 
automatic spousal rollover, and your estate will not have to pay 
any capital gains tax on the transfer.
But when your spouse decides to sell the property, or when your 
spouse dies, he or she is taxed on the increase in the value of the 
property from the time you got the property, not from the time he 
or she got the property.
The sidebar “Jules and Jim decide whether or not to roll over” offers 
an illustration of how the rollover works following the death of 
spouse number one. It is also an illustration of what happens to the 
same piece of property if it’s left to a child instead of the spouse.
If you leave all of your property to your spouse, your estate will 
not have to pay any capital gains tax at all. But what if you don’t 
want to leave everything to your spouse? What if you want to leave 
something to your children? Is there any way that the spousal roll-
over can help you?
In fact, there is. You can still take advantage of the spousal roll-
over by leaving property that is subject to capital gains tax to your 
spouse while leaving property that is not subject to capital gains 
tax to your children or others. The sidebar “Bob and Carol and . . . 
Alice” gives an example.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 35
The spousal rollover applies when you leave your property directly 
to your spouse. It will also apply if you leave your property in trust 
for your spouse in your will if the will is drafted so that
 
✓ Your spouse has the right to receive all of the income earned 
by the trust for the rest of his or her life, and
 
✓ No one but your spouse has the right to receive any of the 
income or the property of the trust as long as your spouse is 
alive.
RRSPs and RRIFs
A registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) contribution is fully 
deductible from the taxpayer’s income. You don’t pay any income 
tax on money that you earn that you put into an RRSP. So if you 
have income in a particular year of $40,000 and you make an RRSP 
contribution of $3,000 in that year, your income is reduced like 
magic to $37,000 for that year. Whenever you withdraw money 
from your RRSP, it’s taxed as income in the year of withdrawal.
Jules and Jim decide whether or not 
to roll over
Jim bought for $10,000 shares that would be worth $110,000 when he died. He could 
leave the shares to his spouse or his son.
Case #1: Jim leaves the shares in his will to his wife, Jules. When he dies, there is an 
automatic spousal rollover of the shares, and there’s no capital gain and no tax payable 
by Jim’s estate. If Jules sells the shares five years later for $170,000, her capital gain will 
be calculated on the sale price of $170,000 minus Jim’s purchase price of $10,000, for a 
capital gain of $160,000, 50 percent of which (or $80,000) is taxable. Jules has to pay the 
tax, but she has the money to do so with what she received on the sale of the shares. If 
Jules doesn’t sell the shares and still owns them when she dies, her estate will have to 
pay capital gains tax based on the value of the shares when she dies.
Case #2: Jim leaves the shares in his will to his son, Jim, Jr. There is a deemed disposition 
by Jim just before his death of the shares for $110,000 and a capital gain of $100,000, 50 
percent of which (or $50,000) is taxable. Jim’s estate has to pay the tax on that capital 
gain, leaving less money in his estate for his son or other beneficiaries. If Jim, Jr., sells 
the shares five years later for $170,000, his capital gain will be calculated on the sale 
price of $170,000 less the value of the shares when he got them from his father’s estate, 
which was $110,000. That will result in a capital gain of $60,000, 50 percent of which (or 
$30,000) is taxable. Jim, Jr., will have to pay the tax on that capital gain.
In both cases the government collects tax on capital gains of $160,000, but when 
Jim leaves the shares to his spouse, no tax is payable until Jules sells the shares, 
and then it is all paid by Jules, not by Jim’s estate. When Jim leaves the shares to 
his son, a good chunk of the tax is payable immediately by Jim’s estate.

36
Bob and Carol and . . . Alice
Carol has shares worth $100,000 that she bought for $20,000, and she also has 
$100,000 in cash. She wants to divide her estate equally between her husband Bob 
and her daughter Alice.
Case #1: If Carol leaves the shares to her daughter and the cash to her husband, 
there will be a deemed disposition of the shares on her death for $100,000 and a 
capital gain of $80,000, 50 percent of which (or $40,000) is taxable. Carol’s estate will 
have to use some of the $100,000 in cash to pay the tax on that capital gain, leaving 
less money for Bob. In effect, Alice will get the shares, while Bob will get the tax bill.
Case #2: If Carol leaves the shares to her husband and the cash to her daughter, 
there will be an automatic spousal rollover of the shares, and there will be no capi-
tal gain and no tax payable by the estate. Alice will get $100,000 in cash and Bob 
will get shares worth $100,000.
So if you have income in a particular year of $40,000 and you with-
draw $3,000 from your RRSP that year, your income is increased to 
$43,000 for that year. When you reach age 71 (actually, at the end of 
that year), you have to withdraw everything from your RRSP, but you 
can roll it over into a registered retirement investment fund (RRIF) so 
that you don’t have to pay tax on the income that has accumulated in 
the RRSP over the years. You then have to make annual withdrawals 
from your RRIF and pay tax on those withdrawals as income.
Death of a taxpayer
A taxpayer who dies is deemed by Canada Revenue to have cashed 
in all RRSPs (and also RRIFs) before dying, and the full amount of the 
RRSPs or RRIFs must be added to income in the terminal return.
Now here’s the first twist. For estate planning purposes, an RRSP or 
RRIF is not treated simply as cash in the estate if it’s given as a gift 
in your will or it’s directed to someone you’ve named as beneficiary 
of your RRSP or RRIF. When tax has to be paid on the RRSP or RRIF 
amounts that are added to income, the tax doesn’t come straight 
out of the RRSP or RRIF. The tax comes first out of ordinary cash in 
your estate. So what can happen when you give someone your RRSP 
or RRIF is that the person gets the full amount of money in the RRSP 
or RRIF, but anyone who was supposed to get cash from your estate 
gets less because it’s being used to pay the tax on the RRSP or RRIF.
Now for the second twist. If you make your spouse the beneficiary 
of your RRSP or RRIF and the proceeds are paid into your spouse’s 
RRSP or RRIF, the money in the RRSP or RRIF is not added to your 

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 37
Mike’s RRSP
Mike has an RRSP worth $100,000 and $100,000 in cash. He would like to divide his 
estate equally between his wife, Pat, and his adult son, who could use the money 
to bolster his Internet business that sells golf and tennis balls.
If Mike leaves his RRSP to his son and the cash to Pat, in his terminal return he will 
be taxed as if he had extra income of $100,000 in the year of his death. Assuming 
that Mike’s estate is taxed in the top bracket this income will be taxed at 45 percent, 
and Mike’s estate will have to pay $45,000 in tax out of the cash set aside for Pat. 
Mike’s son will get the whole RRSP, and his wife will get only $55,000 in cash.
If, on the other hand, Mike leaves the RRSP to his wife and the cash to his son, 
neither his wife nor his estate will have to pay any tax on the RRSP. Pat will get the 
full $100,000 RRSP, and Mike’s son will get $100,000 in cash.
estate’s income and no tax will be payable by your estate or by 
your spouse. (And your spouse will still have the right to make his 
or her usual RRSP or RRIF contribution.) If you name your estate as 
beneficiary of your RRSP or RRIF and your spouse is the beneficiary 
of your estate, the money in your RRSP or RRIF will be taxed in the 
hands of your spouse and no tax will be payable by your estate, 
as long as your spouse and your executor file a refund of premium 
form with Canada Revenue. Your spouse will have the right to 
avoid paying tax on the proceeds by depositing the RRSP or RRIF 
proceeds into his or her RRSP or RRIF. (Again, your spouse will still 
have the right to make his or her usual RRSP or RRIF contribution.)
Likewise, if you name a child or grandchild who is financially 
dependent on you as a beneficiary of your RRSP or RRIF, or you 
leave the RRSP or RRIF to him or her in your will, your estate will 
not have to pay any tax as long as the beneficiary and your execu-
tor file a refund of premiums form. The full amount of the RRSP or 
RRIF will be taxed as income in the hands of your child or grand-
child. (The way in which the amount will be taxed depends on 
whether your child or grandchild is under the age of 18 and/or suf-
fers a physical or mental disability.)
As we keep seeing, life . . . or death . . . is simple if you want to leave 
everything to your spouse. Your estate will not have to pay any tax. 
But supposing you don’t want to leave everything to your spouse? 
Instead you’d like to leave something to your children or even a 
friend? You can use your knowledge about how RRSPs and RRIFs are 
taxed to make sure that both your spouse and someone else of your 
choice will get the most out of your estate while Canada Revenue 
gets the least. See the sidebar “Mike’s RRSP” for an example.

The best way to pass on your RRSP or RRIF
If you want your spouse to get the money from your RRSP or RRIF, 
it is usually better to make him or her the beneficiary of the plan 
rather than having the plan go through your will because
 
✓ Your spouse will be able to get the money more quickly if he 
or she is named as the beneficiary.
 
✓ Your estate’s probate fees will be lower (we discuss probate 
fees later in this chapter).
 
✓ The money will not be used to pay the debts of your estate.
 
If you want someone other than your spouse to get the money 
from your RRSP or RRIF, it’s usually not a good idea to name that 
person as beneficiary of the plan. It’s usually not even a good idea 
to leave the RRSP or RRIF directly to that person in your will. It’s 
probably better to name your estate as beneficiary of your RRSP or 
RRIF and simply divide your estate among the people you choose. 
The story of “Bill and Ted’s estate adventure” shows why.
Putting your money into 
your principal residence
A home, cottage, or vacation property is a form of capital property. 
As with all other kinds of capital property, when you die you will 
be deemed to have sold the property the day before you die. If the 
property went up in value after you got it, there will be a capital 
gain, one-half of which is taxable. But if this home or cottage or 
vacation property is your principal residence, your estate won’t 
have to pay any capital gains tax.
A principal residence can be any residential property that you 
inhabit or your spouse or your child ordinarily inhabits during the 
year. It does not have to be your main residence. Your cottage or 
vacation home can qualify as a principal residence as long as you 
occupy or your spouse or at least one of your children occupies 
the property for some time during the year.
There is a catch here. The catch is that, since 1982, a family is 
allowed only one principal residence each year. If you own only 
a house or only a cottage, the one property you own will be your 
principal residence. But what if you own both a house and a cot-
tage? In that case, when you sell or give away the property — or 
die, more to the point — you (or your executor) must choose one 
of them to be your principal residence and to qualify for the capital 
gains exemption.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 39
Bill and Ted’s estate adventure
Let’s say you have $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in an RRSP, and you would like to 
divide your estate equally between your sons, Bill and Ted.
If you name Bill as beneficiary of your RRSP and you leave Ted the cash in your will, 
here’s what happens. Your estate will be taxed as if you had additional income of 
$100,000 (the amount in your RRSP) in the final year of your life. Assuming the RRSP 
income is taxed at 45 percent, your estate will have to pay $45,000 in tax out of the 
cash you had set aside for Ted. Bill will get the whole RRSP, and Ted will get only 
$55,000. If, instead, you name your estate as beneficiary of your RRSP and your will 
says that your estate is to be divided equally between your sons, here’s what hap-
pens. Your estate will be taxed the same way as before. But now your estate will 
be able to pay the $45,000 tax bill out of the $200,000 in cash it has, leaving $155,000 
to be divided equally between Bill and Ted. Each of them will get $77,500. Excellent!
Making use of the principal residence exemption
Because of the principal residence exemption, you can leave your 
principal residence to anyone you choose without worrying about 
your estate (or anyone else) having to pay capital gains tax on it.
If your only objective in planning your estate is to keep your taxes 
to a minimum, you’re thinking right now that you’ll leave your prin-
cipal residence to your children and leave your spouse some other 
property that’s subject to capital gains tax. Great plan . . . let’s 
start the engines and see if it will fly.
If you have only one residence
If you have only one property that qualifies for the principal resi-
dence exemption, and that property is your family home, you prob-
ably want to leave the property to your spouse, not to your kids. 
If you do that, there’s already an automatic spousal rollover that 
keeps your estate from having to pay capital gains tax, so the prin-
cipal residence exemption doesn’t add anything extra here.
And if you and your spouse own your family home as joint tenants 
(as most couples do), you can’t leave your home to your kids even 
if you want to. That’s because when you die, your share of the 
home will automatically pass to your spouse, no matter what your 
will says. Your share of the home will not become part of your 
estate.
All in all, you won’t be able to make much use of the principal resi-
dence exemption if you own only one residential property.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
40
If you have two residences
The principal residence exemption can be very useful if you own 
more than one residential property. If you own a home and a cot-
tage, for example, you can take advantage of the principal resi-
dence exemption to leave your home to your spouse and your 
cottage to your children. Your estate will not have to pay any capi-
tal gains tax on your home because of the spousal rollover. Your 
estate will not have to pay any capital gains tax on the cottage if 
your executor names your cottage as your principal residence.
Watching out for complications
 
Simplicity is a relative concept as far as taxes are concerned . . . 
but things are fairly simple if you never use your principal resi-
dence exemption from capital gains tax until you die. However, 
things will work out very differently if you have used your principal 
residence exemption in the past. That’s because you can only have 
one principal residence in any given year. Look at “Thelma and 
Louise go to the cottage” to see the effect of this rule.
Thelma and Louise go to the cottage
Let’s say you bought a home in 1985 for $200,000 and sold it in 1995 for $400,000. 
You used the principal residence exemption at the time and paid no capital gains 
tax on the sale of the house. You now have $400,000 in guaranteed investment cer-
tificates instead of a house. You also own a cottage, which you bought in 1985 for 
$50,000 and which is now worth $400,000 because some Hollywood actors moved 
into the area in 1996. You want to divide your estate equally between your daugh-
ters, Thelma and Louise. Louise has always loved the cottage so you leave it to her, 
and you leave the cash to Thelma.
You may think that, because of the principal residence exemption, no tax will be 
payable on the increase in value of the cottage, but you would be wrong. And why 
is that? Because you used your principal residence exemption when you sold your 
home, and you are only allowed to have one principal residence in any year. By 
using the principal residence exemption for the house sale, you in effect said that 
the house was your principal residence from 1985 to 1995. Your executor can’t now 
say that your cottage was your principal residence for 1985 to the present, because 
you’ve already said that your home was your principal residence from 1985 to 1995. 
Your cottage can be your principal residence only from the date in 1995 when the 
house was sold. That means that there will be a taxable capital gain on the increase 
in value of your cottage from 1985 to 1995. If your cottage was worth $150,000 in 
1995, the capital gain will be $100,000, 50 percent of which (or $50,000) will be tax-
able. If the capital gain is taxed at 45 percent, your estate will have to pay $22,500 
in capital gains tax out of the cash you had set aside for Thelma. The result? Louise 
will get a cottage worth $400,000, and Thelma will get only $377,500 in cash instead 
of the $400,000 you thought you were leaving her. Better leave her your car as well.

Giving things away now
You may want to give things away to others before you die for 
many reasons:
 
✓ You may take pleasure in watching them enjoy your gifts 
while you’re still alive. Conversely you may take sadistic plea-
sure in watching some of your friends and relations seethe 
because you gave gifts to others and nothing to them.
 
✓ You may own property that is too expensive or too much 
trouble for you to keep up any more.
 
✓ You may hope to keep your family from fighting over how to 
divide your estate after you die.
 
✓ You may hope to save taxes either for yourself now or your 
estate later.
If you’re dead set on giving your property away while you’re still 
alive, there are a couple of ways to do it. You can make an absolute 
gift of the property by giving away full or part ownership of it, or 
you can create a trust and transfer the property to the trust. We 
tell you more about gifts and trusts in Chapter 6.
At the moment, however, we’re going to look at the tax reasons for 
giving your things away while you’re still alive. The two major pos-
sible tax advantages to giving things away are
 
✓ To reduce the capital gains tax your estate will have to pay 
when you die. Your estate pays capital gains tax as if you 
sold everything you owned on the day before you die. So, the 
less you own at the time you die, the less tax your estate will 
have to pay.
 
✓ To reduce your income tax now. If you give away property 
that is earning income, the income earned by the property in 
the future will be paid to the new owner and should be taxed 
in the hands of the new owner.
Notice that we told you that these things are possible advantages. 
We want to look at each of them a little more closely, because nei-
ther of them is a sure thing.
Will you actually reduce capital gains tax for your estate?
You’ll achieve a capital gains tax advantage for the estate only if 
you give away capital property that has increased in value. There 
is no capital gains tax advantage to giving away cash or cash-like 
investments such as GICs or treasury bills, because they do not 
go up in value, and so your estate will not have to pay any capital 
gains tax on the deemed disposition of these items when you die.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
42
While it’s true that if you give away capital property that has 
increased in value your estate will not have to pay any capital 
gains tax later, you may have to pay capital gains tax now! (And if 
the gift is to your spouse and your spouse sells the property at a 
profit before you die, Canada Revenue has the power to attribute 
the capital gain back to you; in other words, tax you as if the capi-
tal gain is yours.)
 
It doesn’t usually make sense to pay taxes now if you can put them 
off until later. However, you may be willing to pay some capital 
gains tax now if you believe that the property will increase in value 
a lot more before you die. It may also make sense to give away 
property now if you have a capital loss that you can use to offset 
the gain, so that no tax will be payable.
Will you actually reduce your income taxes now?
Even though the new owner of the property will receive the 
income from the property, you may still have to pay the tax on it. 
Depending on whom you give the property to, Canada Revenue 
may attribute the income back to you and tax you as if the income 
continues to be yours. (Canada Revenue will tax the income in the 
hands of the person who will pay tax at the higher rate.) Here’s 
what Canada Revenue can do:
 
✓ If you give income-producing property to your spouse or to a 
trust for your spouse, Canada Revenue has the power to tax 
you on any interest or dividend income or any capital gains 
from that property in the future.
 
✓ If you give income-producing property to a child or grand-
child under the age of 18, Canada Revenue has the power to 
tax you on any interest or dividend income from the property 
in the future (but your child or grandchild will be responsible 
for any future capital gains). You cannot be taxed on the 
income earned by property that you transfer to your adult 
child or grandchild.
Will you be sorry?
Are you quite sure you want to give away your property? If the 
tax consequences of giving away your property don’t put you off 
generosity, there’s still a little more to think about. Whatever your 
reasons for considering giving your money or property away while 
you’re still alive, you should ponder the matter before you give up 
control over property that’s important to you. And you must also 
keep enough money and property for yourself that you don’t go 
from being financially independent to being dependent on others. 
For more information on giving away property before you die, see 
Chapter 5.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 43
Freezing your estate
You may have heard people refer to an “estate freeze” and won-
dered what they were talking about. The term estate freeze can be 
used to describe any of several estate planning techniques that are 
used to reduce the capital gains tax that you would otherwise have 
to pay when you leave capital property to your children or grand-
children when you die. They are used for capital property that is 
expected to increase a lot in value in the future.
Estate freezes are all designed to transfer your property out of 
your hands so that you cap the amount of capital gains tax you’ll 
ever pay. (You may have to pay capital gains tax on the current 
value of the property.) If the property goes up in value in the 
future, whoever gets the property from you — usually someone in 
the next generation or even the one after that — will have to pay 
capital gains tax on that future increase.
Estate freezes can get really complicated, and sometimes they’re 
less complicated. There are no simple estate freezes. In the follow-
ing sections, we look at your estate-freezing options.
 
Estate freezes involving trusts or corporations are not do-it-yourself 
projects. If you are thinking about an estate freeze, you need pro-
fessional tax and legal advice. And if you have to stop to think 
about whether you can afford to pay for fancy advice, trust us, 
you don’t need to think about an estate freeze — you don’t have 
enough money to make an estate freeze worthwhile!
A gift
A gift of your property to a child or grandchild is a relatively 
simple form of estate freeze. (In the previous section and in 
Chapter 5 we tell you about the advantages and disadvantages of 
giving your property away.) When you give your property to your 
child or grandchild you pay capital gains tax exactly as if you sold 
the property at its current fair market value. Your child or grand-
child has to pay the tax on any capital gains that accumulate in the 
future.
 
Don’t forget that you may get stuck paying annual taxes on income 
from the property as long as your child or grandchild is under 18!
The sidebar “Harold’s estate freeze” describes an estate freeze 
using a gift.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
44
Harold’s estate freeze
Harold owned shares that cost him $10,000 and that went up in value to $50,000. 
He had a hunch that the shares would go up dramatically in the future and so he 
gave them to his daughter, Maude. Harold’s hunch about the shares was right. 
When Harold died (too bad he didn’t have a hunch about that chandelier as well), 
the shares were worth $100,000. Maude held onto the shares until this year, when 
she sold them for $150,000.
Here’s how Harold and Maude were taxed:
 ✓ When Harold gave his shares to Maude, he was taxed as if he had sold them for 
their then current value of $50,000, for a capital gain of $40,000, 50 percent of which 
(or $20,000) was taxable. Because Harold had an income that year of $100,000, the 
capital gain was taxed at the highest rate, 45 percent in Harold’s province. He had 
to pay tax of $9,000, but it was an amount Harold could easily afford.
 ✓ When Harold died, no capital gains tax on the shares was payable by his estate 
because the shares already belonged to Maude.
 ✓ When Maude sold the shares this year, she had a capital gain of $100,000 (the 
sale price less the value of the shares when Harold gave them to her), 50 per-
cent of which (or $50,000) is taxable. Maude, like her father, was a high earner, 
so her capital gain was also taxed at the rate of 45 percent. She had to pay tax 
of $22,500, and had the money to do so out of the proceeds of sale of the shares.
If Harold had not had the foresight to put this relatively simple estate freeze in 
place, this is what would have happened:
 ✓ When Harold died, he would have been deemed by the tax department to have 
disposed of the shares at their then current value of $100,000, resulting in a cap-
ital gain of $90,000, 50 percent of which (or $45,000) would have been taxable. 
At the tax rate of 45 percent, Harold’s estate would have had to pay $20,250 in 
tax. If there was not enough cash in Harold’s estate to pay the tax, Harold’s 
executor would have had to sell some of Harold’s other property to come up 
with the money.
 ✓ Under tax law, Maude would have been deemed to receive the shares from 
her father’s estate for $100,000. When Maude sold the shares, she would have 
had a capital gain of only $50,000 (the sale price less the value of the shares 
when Harold died), 50 percent of which (or $25,000) would have been taxable. 
At Maude’s tax rate of 45 percent, she would have had to pay tax of $11,250.
In either case, the total amount of tax would be the same — $31,500. So an estate 
freeze didn’t save the family tax dollars at all. But in the first case the timing of the 
taxes caused less inconvenience to the parties. Notice, however, that it caused 
less inconvenience only because Harold had the cash to pay the capital gains tax 
while he was alive, and because his estate was cash-strapped.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 45
A sale
Another way of creating an estate freeze is to sell your property to 
your child or grandchild at its current fair market value. You pay 
the capital gain based on the sale price of the property, and your 
child or grandchild will have to pay any future capital gains when 
the property is sold or otherwise disposed of. You can set up the 
transaction so that your child does not pay you right away but 
instead gives you a promissory note, which is a document in which 
your child promises to pay the sale price when you demand it. The 
advantage of using a promissory note is that that you don’t have to 
pay tax on the entire sale price at once — Canada Revenue lets you 
spread out the capital gain over up to five years.
“Frankie sells Johnny a painting” tells the story of a sale of property.
If you don’t in fact want any money from your child or grandchild, 
you don’t ever have to demand payment during your lifetime. 
(You’ll still have to pay the capital gains tax either in a lump or 
spread out over five years.) Your child or grandchild will have to 
pay your estate the amount of the promissory note when you die 
(and can buy life insurance on your life to get the money to do so) 
unless you forgive the promissory note in your will.
A trust
In another form of estate freeze, you can set up a trust that you 
manage for your children or grandchildren and give property to 
the trust. (You can find out about trusts in Chapter 6.) This will 
allow you to keep some control over the property. You have to 
pay capital gains tax as if you sold the property at its fair market 
value when you handed it over to the trust. You won’t have to 
pay the tax on future capital gains; it will have to be paid by 
either the trust or the beneficiaries of the trust, depending on 
the circumstances.
 
✓ If the trust sells the property and continues to hold the pro-
ceeds of sale in trust, the trust will pay the tax.
 
✓ If the trust sells the property and pays the proceeds of sale to 
the beneficiary, the trustee decides whether the trust or the 
beneficiary will pay the tax.
 
✓ No tax is payable when the trust ends and the trustee trans-
fers the property to the beneficiary, but the beneficiary takes 
over the property at the trust’s adjusted cost base. When the 
beneficiary disposes of the property, he or she is taxed on the 
wcapital gain from the time the property was transferred by 
you to the trust.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
46
A corporation
In all three of the above types of estate freeze, you will have to pay 
tax now as the cost of handing over responsibility for future capital 
gains tax to your children or grandchildren. In one type of estate 
freeze — an estate freeze involving a corporation — you don’t have 
to pay any capital gains tax until you die. This kind of estate freeze 
is very complicated and is usually used to pass on a business or 
real estate investments.
 
You create a corporation and transfer ownership of property to 
the corporation in return for shares in the corporation. You give 
your children shares in the corporation as well. The corporation is 
organized using different classes of shares, so that you take shares 
that give you voting rights and control over the corporation and 
you give your children shares that go up in value as the property 
goes up in value. If the estate freeze is set up properly, there is 
a rollover (similar to a spousal rollover) when you transfer your 
property to the corporation, and the transfer doesn’t trigger any 
capital gains tax at the time.
When you die, your estate pays capital gains tax on the value of 
your shares in the corporation — which will be the same as the 
value of the property when you transferred it to the corporation. If 
your children ever sell their shares, they will pay capital gains tax 
based on the increase in the value of the property from the time it 
was transferred into the corporation. (If the corporation, which is 
separate from the humans who control it, sells the property, it will 
pay capital gains tax based on the increase in value of the property 
Frankie sells Johnny a painting
Frankie owned a Group of Seven painting that she received under her mother’s will 
in 1975. Its value then was $40,000. She sold it to her son, Johnny, for $100,000, its 
fair market value at the time, and received in exchange Johnny’s promissory note.
In that year and in each of the following four years, Frankie asked Johnny to pay 
$20,000 of the full amount. Frankie’s capital gain in total was $60,000, of which 50 
percent ($30,000) was taxable. Instead of adding $30,000 to her taxable income in 
the first year, Frankie added $6,000 in each of five years. Because her ordinary 
income was $118,000, the added amount did not take her income into the top tax 
bracket, so Frankie didn’t have to pay tax at the top rate of 45 percent on any of the 
taxable capital gain. If she had been required to pay the entire tax in the year she 
sold the painting, she would have had to pay tax at 45 percent on a substantial part 
of the capital gain.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 47
from the time it was transferred to the corporation. The proceeds 
from the sale, less the cost of paying the tax, could then be paid 
out to the shareholder children in the form of dividends.)
Donating to charity
If you leave money or property to a registered charity, your estate 
will be able to claim a tax credit in your terminal tax return against 
the income tax it would otherwise have to pay. Your estate will be 
allowed to claim a tax credit of 15 percent of the first $200 in dona-
tions and 29 percent of donations from $200 up to the full amount 
of your net income reported in your final tax return. The amount of 
tax that your estate would otherwise pay is reduced by the amount 
of this tax credit.
If the charitable donations in your will are more than your net 
income in your final tax return, your executor has the right to refile 
your tax return for the year before you died and use the remainder 
of the donation to get a tax credit to reduce that year’s taxes after 
the fact. (Your estate will get a refund.)
It’s important to know how to make charitable donations in the 
right way in order to get the maximum tax benefits possible. We 
tell you more about giving money to charities in Chapter 10.
Tax Planning That Takes 
Place after You Die
Some tax-saving strategies can be put into effect only after you die. 
That probably means your involvement with these strategies will 
be minimal . . .
RRSPs
If you have not used up your RRSP contribution allowance for the 
year in which you die, your executor can contribute the unused por-
tion to your spouse’s RRSP after you die, and can use the contribution 
as a deduction in calculating taxable income on your final tax return.
Capital losses and spousal rollovers
If you have any unused capital losses when you die, it may make 
sense for your executor to elect not to take a spousal rollover on 
some of the assets you leave to your spouse. (It’s automatic unless 
the executor chooses not to have it.)

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
48
If you have unused capital losses, your executor can apply them to 
reduce capital gains on the transfer of property to your spouse at 
market value. If your executor doesn’t use these capital losses in your 
final tax return (or by refiling for previous years), they are lost. By 
using your capital loss to offset capital gains at the time of your death, 
the executor makes two things happen. One, your estate will have no 
capital gain now, and two, your spouse’s capital gain in the future will 
be lower because it will be calculated using the value of the property 
when your spouse gets the property, not when you got the property.
Example, anyone? Well, since you asked, take a look at “Victoria’s 
executor takes advantage.”
Victoria’s executor takes advantage
Victoria loved to invest in the stock market. She had some good years and some bad 
years. The year before Victoria died was a bad year. She bought shares for $50,000 at 
the beginning of the year, but they went down and down in value. In December, she sold 
the shares for $10,000. She ended the year with a capital loss of $40,000. Undaunted, 
Victoria used her remaining $10,000 to buy shares in another company early the next 
year. Several months later, the shares shot up to $50,000 virtually overnight. The shock 
of joy was too great, and Victoria left her entire estate to her husband Victor. One year 
later, when the shares had gone up to $100,000, Victor decided to sell the shares, feeling 
that tracking their meteoric rise reminded him too painfully of his wife.
Let’s look at two scenarios, one in which the automatic rollover takes place, and 
one in which it doesn’t:
 ✓ Victoria’s executor allowed the automatic spousal rollover to take place. 
The new shares were transferred to Victor at Victoria’s original cost base of 
$10,000, so her estate did not have a capital gain and did not have to pay capi-
tal gains tax. But when Victor sold the shares one year later, his capital gain 
was $90,000 — the difference between the sale price of $100,000 and Victoria’s 
purchase price of $10,000 — 50 percent of which (or $45,000) was taxable. The 
capital gain took Victor into the top tax bracket and was taxed at 45 percent, 
so Victor had to pay $20,500 in tax. Victor was not able to take advantage of 
Victoria’s capital loss from the year before she died to offset his capital gain.
 ✓ Victoria’s executor opted out of the spousal rollover. The new shares were trans-
ferred to Victor from Victoria’s estate at their then current market value of $50,000, 
resulting in a capital gain to the estate of $40,000. However, Victoria’s executor was 
able to apply her capital loss of $40,000 from the year before to offset this capital 
gain completely. As a result her estate did not have to pay any tax on the transfer. 
When Victor sold the shares one year later, his capital gain was only $50,000 — the 
difference between the sale price of $100,000 and the value of the shares when he 
got them from Victoria’s estate. The taxable capital gain was $25,000. It was taxed 
at a rate of 45 percent so Victor had to pay $11,250 in tax — but that was just over 
half of what he would have paid if there had been a spousal rollover.

 Chapter 3: The Taxman Cometh: Taxes and Your Estate 49
Your executor needs to know about your unused capital losses 
before he or she can make the decision to opt out of the spousal 
rollover. Make sure that you tell your executor where to find your 
past income tax records and other documents that contain this 
information. We’ll nag you about organizing all of your records for 
your executor in Chapter 17.
When the Taxman Finally 
Arriveth . . . With the Bill
In the previous sections in this chapter, we share a number of 
ways that you may be able to reduce the tax your estate will 
have to pay on the property you own when you die. But unless 
you leave everything to your spouse, your estate will have to pay 
something. In this section, we outline how you can prepare for that 
unhappy time.
 
If you live or own property in another country, your estate may be 
subject to foreign income tax or inheritance taxes. You should get 
advice from a lawyer and/or accountant in that country. Ask your 
Canadian accountant or lawyer for a recommendation.
Estimating the tax
You can’t know what property you will own when you die or what 
it will be worth. All you can do is estimate your taxes (over and 
above your usual tax bill) based on your present situation. To keep 
your estate plan current, you’ll need to do this from time to time. 
Start by going to Table 2-1 in Chapter 2 and making a list of every-
thing you own.
Make a list of everything that you are not leaving to your spouse. 
Don’t worry about property that won’t be subject to capital gains, 
such as cash, GICs, treasury bills, or your principal residence. 
Estimate your capital gain for each remaining piece of property by 
doing the following calculation.

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
50
Current fair market value of property
$________
– Estimated costs to sell, if any
$________
= Adjusted sale price
$________ (A)
Purchase price of property (or fair market value of 
property when you acquired it, if you didn’t buy it)
$________
+ Costs of buying (if any)
$________
= Adjusted cost base
$________ (B)
A – B = Capital gain
$________
× 50% (or × 0.50) = Taxable capital gain
$________ (C)
When you have done this calculation for everything you own, add 
the taxable capital gains figures together for your total taxable 
capital gains and call it amount (D).
Now you know how much your taxable capital gains will be, but 
you’re not finished yet. You haven’t taken into account the tax 
you will have to pay on any RRSPs or RRIFs that you do not leave 
to your spouse. Remember that the full value of your RRSPs and 
RRIFs will be taxed as income received by your estate. So add 
together the balances in all of your RRSPs and RRIFs (that you 
don’t intend to leave to your spouse) and add that total to your 
taxable capital gains total. That combined total is the amount 
on which your estate will be taxed as a result of the gifts you’re 
making in your will.
Here’s the rest of the calculation.
Total taxable capital gains
$________ (D)
+ RRSPs and RRIFs not left to spouse
$________
= Amount in your estate that is subject to tax
$________ (E)
Finally, estimate the tax rate that will be applied to the capital 
gains and RRSPs and RRIFs. Let’s do this the lazy way. After you 
dispose of all your capital property the day before you die, and 
after all of your RRSPs or RRIFs are rolled in, there’s a very good 
chance you’ll have made it into the top tax bracket. So assume a 
tax rate of 45 percent . . . if that’s not true in your case, you’ll be 
too embarrassed to tell anyone anyway. Here’s how to calculate 
your taxes.

Determining where the 
money will come from
After you have an idea of how much tax your estate will have to 
pay, think about where the money will come from to pay it. Canada 
Revenue doesn’t like to wait to be paid — although your executor 
may be able to work out a deal with them if there is difficulty in 
paying the tax owing right away. Here are the usual possibilities for 
paying the tax bill:
 
✓ Your estate may be rolling in cash and there will be enough of 
it to pay the tax.
 
✓ If your estate does not have enough cash to pay the tax, it 
may have valuable property that can be sold and turned into 
cash. If you would like your executor to sell (or not to sell) 
specific property you should leave instructions in your will 
to that effect.
 
✓ If there is not enough cash in the estate or you don’t want 
non-cash property in your estate sold, you’ll have to buy 
enough (additional) life insurance to cover the expected 
tax bill.
 
✓ If your estate owes tax money and simply doesn’t have 
enough cash or property to cover the bill, Canada Revenue 
can go after the executor personally if he or she transferred 
cash or property out of the estate to the beneficiaries before 
the taxes were paid. But if the executor didn’t do that and 
there still isn’t enough money to pay the taxes due in the ter-
minal return, the tax authorities have to go whistle. They can’t 
get it out of your executor or surviving family or friends.
Ensuring that the wrong person 
doesn’t get stuck with the bill
Throughout this chapter we show you examples of situations in 
which one beneficiary receives a piece of property while another 
beneficiary gets stuck paying the taxes. That’s because of a rule of 
estates law that the taxes and other debts of your estate are to be 
paid using the residue of your estate (anything you have not left as 

Part I: Estate Planning Basics  
52
a specific gift to a specific individual) first, then out of cash gifts 
to specific individuals, then out of non-cash gifts (they’d have to 
be sold for cash, of course). Keep that in mind when you plan your 
gifts under your will. You can plan around this in several ways:
 
✓ Make sure that you have enough cash, through insurance 
or otherwise, to pay all of your taxes so that gifts of cash to 
named individuals are not affected.
 
✓ Divide your estate among your beneficiaries in shares instead 
of leaving them specific property. That way they’ll share 
equally in losses to tax or debt payments.
 
✓ State in your will that the person who gets a particular piece 
of property is responsible for any taxes on that property. 
Then you won’t run into the problem of one person getting 
the property and another person footing the tax bill.
Investigating Probate Fees
Probate fees are fees charged by the provincial surrogate court (the 
court that handles wills and estate matters) for its work in checking 
out a will to see that it’s valid and formally appointing the executor. 
In theory they are administrative fees, but in fact they’re more like 
a tax because, in most provinces, they are based on the value of the 
property in the estate rather than on the amount of work that the 
court does. Probate fees can amount to thousands of dollars.
Property that is not part of the estate (jointly owned property, life 
insurance proceeds, pension plans, and RRSPs payable directly to 
a beneficiary) does not have to be included in calculating the value 
of the estate for probate fee purposes. Any of the tax strategies 
mentioned in this chapter that reduce your taxes by reducing the 
overall value of your estate will also reduce your probate fees.
 
Not all wills have to be probated, because some kinds of property 
can be transferred to a beneficiary without a probated will. Your will 
will have to be probated if your estate has even one piece of prop-
erty that can be transferred only with a probated will. (After you die, 
your executor should consult a lawyer about whether or not your 
will has to be probated.) Once your will is probated, the probate 
fees are calculated on the value of all of the property in your estate.
 
Theoretically, it’s possible to have two wills (one for the property 
that needs probate and the other for the property that doesn’t). 
Your executor could then probate only the one will, and pay pro-
bate fees based only on the property dealt with in that will. Don’t 
even think about trying this without the help of a lawyer! If either 
will is drafted incorrectly, one will may cancel out the other.

s we tell you in Chapter 1, part of estate planning is build-

your family (or friends, or a favourite charity) after you’re gone. 
Building an estate isn’t the only way to carry out that goal — you 
may be able to accomplish the same thing without going through 
all the hard work of earning and saving. You may be able simply 
to arrange to have a sum of money paid to your estate or an indi-
vidual on your death. Does this sound like the answer to your 
prayers? Does it still sound like the answer to your prayers when 
we tell you we’re talking about life insurance?
We’re not going to badger you to buy insurance in this chapter. 
We’re just going to help you decide whether you need it or not. 
Some people do, some people don’t. If you do, in this chapter we’re 
also going to do our best to demystify life insurance for you so that 
you’re armed to go out and talk fearlessly to insurance agents.

Getting Acquainted with 
Life Insurance
A life insurance policy is a legal agreement between the owner of 
the policy and an insurance company. The owner of the policy 
agrees to pay premiums to the insurance company in return for 
the insurance company’s promise to pay a specified sum of money 
(the face amount of the policy) to a named person (the benefi-
ciary of the policy) when the person whose life is insured (the 
life insured) dies. The face amount of the policy is not subject to 
income tax when it’s paid out.
The owner of the policy is not necessarily the person whose life 
is insured. Someone else, for example the beneficiary, can own 
the policy and pay the premiums. But not just anyone can insure 
another person’s life. The owner of an insurance policy must have 
an insurable interest in the life of the insured person. An insurable 
interest means a close relationship, whether a family or business 
relationship, which creates a reason for the owner of the policy to 
want the life insured to stay alive. (Well, that’s the theory, anyway. 
We’re sure you have your own thoughts about people in close rela-
tionships you’d just as soon see dead.) Insurance companies get 
nervous about people who insure the lives of others who have no 
good reason to keep those others alive, and who stand to make a 
lot of money if they die.
A life insurance policy is a legal contract, but it’s also a bet. When 
you take out a life insurance policy, you’re betting that the life 
insured is going to die while the policy is in force. Naturally, you’re 
hoping that the insured is not going to die, or at least not any time 
soon. The insurance company, on the other hand, is betting that 
the life insured won’t die — or at least not until so much has been 
paid in premiums that the insurance company won’t lose money 
by paying the face amount of the policy.
Deciding Whether You Need 
Life Insurance
Not everyone needs life insurance. To help you decide whether or 
not you do, consider the usual ways people use life insurance, and 
you can see if any of them apply to you. Life insurance is used

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 57
 
✓ To replace the income you won’t be alive to earn for the 
people you support. Without your income, or insurance to 
replace it, your family may have to change their lifestyle dras-
tically, if they can get by at all.
 
✓ To pay off a large debt, such as a mortgage on your home or 
a large personal or business loan, or pay for a major expense 
like a university education for your children. Without your 
income or insurance, your family may not be able to pay the 
debt or expense and so may have to eat into the capital of 
your estate.
 
✓ To pay off expenses related to your death, such as funeral 
costs, lawyer’s fees, taxes, and probate fees. These debts and 
expenses don’t exist until you die and, without insurance, are 
normally paid out of your estate.
 
✓ To leave money you wouldn’t otherwise have to a family 
member, friend, or charity. You may want to create more 
money when you die, so that you have more to give away.
You don’t need life insurance if you
 
✓ Don’t have anyone who depends on you for support.
 
✓ Have no large debts or expenses.
 
✓ Have plenty of cash or property in your estate to pay funeral 
expenses, lawyers’ fees, and taxes.
 
✓ Don’t need or want extra money to leave to family, friends, or 
charities.
And even if you do support other people or have debts or major 
expenses, you still may not need insurance if there will be enough 
money in your estate without insurance.
Calculating How Much Life 
Insurance You Need
The amount of insurance you need depends on the reason or rea-
sons you need the insurance and how much other money will be 
available to meet those needs when you die.
After you know how much insurance you need, you have to calcu-
late how much you can afford, and you can then decide how much 
you actually want to buy.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
58
If you need insurance to 
replace your income
You want your family to be able to live as well after you die as they 
do now. How much insurance do you need for them to be able to 
do that? In order to answer that question, you have to answer a 
few questions, which we ask in this section.
 
You may be able to find an insurance company that offers a policy 
that pays a specified amount of money to the beneficiary each 
month instead of one lump sum. You may even be able to get a 
policy in which the payment is indexed to the cost of living so that 
it goes up with inflation. This type of insurance is called a rever-
sionary annuity or contingent annuity policy. With a policy like this, 
you don’t have to go through the contortions of figuring out what 
lump sum will produce the income needed — you just have to 
guess what income will be needed and for how long.
What will your family’s expenses be?
Start with your family’s expenses today. Then make some adjust-
ments to take into account the fact that you won’t be around. 
When you’re gone, your personal expenses will go too, but there 
may be new expenses to take their place because your family may 
have to pay someone to do some of the things that you do for free, 
like child care or household maintenance and repairs.
You also have to look into the future and make adjustments for 
how your family’s expenses may change over time. Are your fam-
ily’s expenses likely to go up or down? If your children are young, 
the expenses will grow with them. If your children are older and 
ready to leave home, your spouse will no longer have to support 
them and may even be able to move to a smaller, less expensive 
home.
What other income will your family have?
How much income will your family have when you die and your 
salary goes west with you? Your panicky answer of “Nothing! 
They’ll be destitute and living on the streets!” probably is not cor-
rect. Sit down, put a cold compress on your forehead, and think 
rationally about whether your family will have any of these things:
 
✓ Your spouse’s income. If your spouse works or has invest-
ment income, that income will probably continue to be avail-
able to pay the family’s expenses.
 
✓ Pension plan payments. If you have a pension plan through 
work or any union, professional, or fraternal organization, or 

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 59
if you are a veteran who is eligible for Veterans Affairs Canada 
benefits, your spouse and/or dependent children (those under 
the age of 18, or between 18 and 25 and in full-time attendance 
at school) may be entitled to receive a monthly pension and/
or a lump-sum payment. Speak to the administrator of your 
pension plan or contact VAC to see how much your family 
members will be entitled to receive and for how long.
 
✓ Canada Pension Plan death benefits. Your estate may be 
entitled to receive a lump-sum death benefit, your spouse 
may be entitled to receive a monthly survivor’s benefit, and 
your dependent children may be entitled to receive a monthly 
orphan’s benefit. Contact Service Canada or go to their Web 
site (www.servicecanada.gc.ca) to find out how much 
your spouse and/or children will likely receive.
 
✓ Old Age Security benefits. If you are or your spouse is receiv-
ing Old Age Security payments, your spouse may be eligible 
for increased benefits after you die. Even if neither of you is 
receiving anything at the time of your death, benefits may 
be available for your spouse if he or she is between 60 and 
65. You can also get information about these benefits from 
Service Canada.
 
✓ Other death benefits. If you belong to any organization, social 
club, or lodge, it may provide death benefits to your estate or 
surviving family. Contact the organization to find out.
 
✓ Income earned by your estate. If your estate includes cash, 
investments, or rent-producing property, it will earn income. 
How much income, of course, depends on the size of your 
estate and interest rates, going rental rates, and so on.
For pensions or death benefits, a “spouse” may or may not have to 
be legally married to you or be of the opposite sex, depending on 
the wording of the legislation, pension plan, or other agreement.
What will the shortfall be?
Add up all of your family’s likely expenses. Then add up all of your 
family’s likely income. Subtract the expenses from the income. 
If your family’s expenses are more than your family’s projected 
income without your salary, you need enough insurance to make 
up the shortfall.
What lump sum of money will be needed 
to make up the shortfall?
To cover a shortfall, you need a sum of money that will produce 
enough income to make up for the shortfall as long as it lasts. 
That’s easy for us to say, you’re thinking, but how on earth do you 
calculate something like that without a crystal ball? We admit that 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
60
it’s difficult to do — you do need to be able to see into the future, 
or at least to be able to make a good guess about these things:
 
✓ How long your family will need the extra money. You have to 
estimate how long your children will be dependent and how 
long your spouse is likely to live (if he or she is not self-
supporting) and will need an income.
 
✓ What future interest rates are likely to be — because that 
determines how much income the lump sum will earn.
 
✓ What the rate of inflation is likely to be — because that affects 
how much your family’s expenses will increase.
 
✓ What your spouse’s (and other supporting family members’) 
income tax rate is likely to be — because that determines how 
much will be available after taxes to pay expenses.
Professionals called actuaries develop tables to help life insurance 
companies, accountants, and other financial advisers do these cal-
culations. Working with assumptions about the things we’ve talked 
about above (interest rates, inflation, life expectancy of a spouse), 
an actuary can name the sum of money that your family will need. 
It’s an amount that will produce a little less income than is needed 
to cover expenses each year, so that every year it will be necessary 
to spend a bit of the lump sum. If all of the actuary’s assumptions 
turn out to be right, at the end of the time for which the income 
was needed, all the income and the lump sum will be gone.
You’re not an actuary (well, most people who are reading this 
aren’t actuaries). How do you figure out how much insurance you 
need? There are several possibilities:
 
✓ Ask an insurance agent, broker, or insurance company repre-
sentative. You should be aware, however, that most insurance 
professionals are paid a commission based on the amount of 
insurance they sell, so they may have a motive to overstate 
the amount of insurance you need. Make sure you get an 
explanation of how the amount was arrived at.
 
✓ Visit insurance company Web sites. Some of them include 
interactive pages that you can use to calculate how much 
insurance you need based on the amount of income you want 
to replace. Unfortunately, these Web sites don’t tell you the 
assumptions (such as interest rate or inflation) they are rely-
ing on in doing their calculations.
 
✓ Look at Personal Finance For Canadians For Dummies, by Eric 
Tyson and Tony Martin (Wiley) — that book offers a table that 
helps you estimate the amount of insurance you need.

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 61
 
✓ Ask your accountant, if you have one. You may have to pay 
for your accountant’s time, but the answer you get should be 
accurate, reliable, and unbiased.
We can also suggest a much simpler approach. Just look at the 
amount you’ve calculated to be your family’s expected shortfall 
and figure out what lump sum, if invested at today’s interest rates, 
would produce the right amount of income to cover the shortfall. 
It’s not as precise as the answer an actuary would come up with, 
and in fact it may lead you to buy more life insurance than a strict 
actuarial calculation would. That’s because you’re not aiming 
for an amount that will be used up over time. Instead, when the 
income is no longer needed the lump sum will still be there. You 
can use this calculation to check the recommendation an insur-
ance agent makes about how much insurance you need.
If you need insurance to pay 
a debt or expense
If you need insurance to pay off a large debt such as a mortgage on 
your home or to pay for a major expense like a university educa-
tion for your children, you need insurance in the same amount as 
the debt or expense. So this calculation is a pretty simple one.
If you need insurance 
to leave money
This is another simple calculation. How much money do you want 
to leave to your family, friends, or charity? That’s the amount of 
insurance you need to buy.
Determining Who Should 
Get the Insurance Money
When you die, the insurance company will pay the proceeds of 
the policy to the person named as beneficiary in the policy. That 
means you have to choose a beneficiary as well as deciding how 
much coverage you need. Your choice of beneficiary will be related 
to the reason you’re buying the policy, but the choice may not 
be obvious. For example, just because you take out an insurance 
policy so that you can leave some money to a charity doesn’t nec-
essarily mean that you should name the charity as the beneficiary. 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
62
You have to choose the beneficiary carefully so that you can meet 
your overall estate planning objectives. You need to discuss this 
matter with the professional (lawyer, accountant, financial plan-
ner) who’s helping you to plan your estate.
There are three ways of naming a beneficiary, which we cover in 
this section.
Naming an individual 
as your beneficiary
If you name an individual as your beneficiary, the proceeds of 
your policy will be paid directly to that person when you die. 
None of the money can be used to pay off the debts of your estate, 
because it’s not part of your estate. No probate fees are payable 
on the money either, again because it’s not part of your estate (see 
Chapter 3 for more on probate fees). On your death, your benefi-
ciary can apply directly to the insurance company for payment of 
the proceeds and doesn’t have to wait for your executor to make a 
payment out of the estate.
 
It’s possible to choose to name a beneficiary irrevocably. If you do 
so, you won’t be able to change the beneficiary or deal with the 
policy in any way without the consent of that beneficiary.
 
Naming an individual as your beneficiary has a few disadvantages:
 
✓ If you decide to change your beneficiary, you have to notify 
your insurance company in writing. The insurance company 
will pay out the proceeds only to the beneficiary named offi-
cially in its records.
 
✓ If you decide to change your will, you may have to think about 
changing your beneficiaries under your insurance policy too, 
to make sure that your choice of beneficiary still meets your 
estate planning objectives.
 
✓ If your beneficiary is a child, the insurance company can’t just 
pay the money to the child. It will have to be paid into court 
and a government official will look after the money until the 
child comes of age. (We talk about how to leave insurance 
money to children in “Creating an insurance trust,” a little 
later in this chapter.)
If you want to name an individual as your beneficiary, you should 
name an alternate beneficiary in the policy as well. If you don’t and 
your beneficiary dies before you do, the insurance proceeds will 
be paid to your estate.

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 63
Naming your estate as 
your beneficiary
If you name your estate as your beneficiary, when you die the 
insurance company will pay the proceeds of your policy to your 
executor and the insurance proceeds will be part of your estate. 
The money will be divided among your family and/or friends in the 
way you have instructed in your will. If you don’t have a will, the 
money will be divided among your family according to the law of 
your province (see Chapter 12).
The advantage of naming your estate as beneficiary is that you 
don’t have to fill out an insurance company form naming a new 
beneficiary if you change your mind about who should get the pro-
ceeds of the policy. When you change your will, you’re also chang-
ing what happens to the insurance money.
 
Naming your estate as beneficiary has two disadvantages:
 
✓ The insurance proceeds can be used to pay your debts. Your 
executor must pay your debts before dividing your estate 
among your heirs. So if you name your estate as your benefi-
ciary, some of the money may go to your creditors and not 
your family.
 
✓ The insurance proceeds are subject to probate fees. Probate 
fees are court fees that in most provinces are calculated on 
the value of an estate. If the insurance proceeds are paid to 
your estate, they will be included when the probate fees on 
your estate are calculated, and so the fees will be higher. 
Probate fees are paid out of the estate.
Creating an insurance trust
You can create a trust to hold insurance proceeds on behalf of 
your beneficiaries, and tell your insurance company to pay the 
proceeds to the person you name as trustee. When you create the 
trust, you have to give instructions to the trustee about what you 
want him or her to do with the proceeds.
For example, you might create an insurance trust if you have 
young children and you don’t want the government to manage the 
money for them if you die before they reach the age of majority. 
You might direct your trustee to keep the money invested for your 
children and to use the income the money earns to pay your chil-
dren’s expenses until they come of age.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
64
You can also use an insurance trust to divide up your life insur-
ance proceeds the same way you are dividing up your estate in 
your will. You can even have your executor act as trustee. If the 
trust is worded carefully, the insurance proceeds will not be con-
sidered to be part of your estate, and therefore won’t be subject to 
probate fees or claims by your creditors.
 
You can create a trust in your will or by using a separate document 
called a trust agreement. The will or trust document has to be pre-
pared by a lawyer. We tell you a lot more about trusts in Chapter 6.
 Deciding on the Kind of 
Life Insurance You Want
You wouldn’t think it from the large number of names that insur-
ance companies bandy about for their policies, but there are only 
two basic types of insurance: term insurance and permanent 
insurance.
Term insurance
Term insurance provides life insurance coverage for a fixed period, 
or term. If the insured person dies during that term, the insurance 
company will pay a specified sum of money (the face amount of the 
policy) to the beneficiary. If the insured person dies after the term 
ends, the insurance company doesn’t have to pay anything at all.
A term insurance policy can have a term of 1 year, 5 years, 10 
years, 15 years, 20 years, or even longer. At the start of the term, 
the insurance company will set an annual premium rate based on 
your age and health, the amount of coverage, and the length of the 
term. The younger and healthier you are, the less likely you are to 
die and the lower your premiums will be. The longer the term is, 
the higher the premium will be, because even if you are young and 
healthy when you buy the insurance, you will become older, less 
healthy, and more likely to die before the insurance expires.
At the end of the term one of three things may happen:
 
✓ The insurance policy may simply expire — in which case you 
will have to buy new insurance, the cost of which will depend 
on your age and health at that time. If you have become very 
unhealthy, you may not be able to get insurance at all.
 
✓ The insurance policy may be renewable. You may be able 
to renew the policy for a previously agreed premium, if the 

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 65
policy guaranteed this right. Most term policies cannot be 
renewed past the age of 70. But if you’re a term insurance 
junkie, don’t despair! It is possible to get term insurance up 
to age 100 and even beyond under a Term to 100 policy. In 
some versions of these policies, if the insured reaches the age 
of 100, coverage continues even though premiums no longer 
have to be paid. In other versions, if the insured lives to be 
100, coverage ends but the insurance company will pay out 
some or the entire face amount of the policy.
 
✓ You may be able to convert the policy into permanent insur-
ance before you reach the age at which the policy can no 
longer be renewed.
The main advantage of term life insurance is its lower cost. While 
no insurance policy is cheap, term insurance can cost from one-
quarter to one-tenth the price of the same amount of permanent 
insurance. That means that you can get a lot more insurance cov-
erage for your premium dollar than you can with permanent insur-
ance. This is especially important to people with young families, 
who have high insurance needs at a time of their life when their 
expenses are high.
The main disadvantage of term life insurance is that the only way 
to get any money from your insurance company is to die. (This is 
a bit extreme, don’t you think?) If you stop paying the premiums, 
or you reach the maximum age under the policy, the policy simply 
ends and you don’t receive a cent — even though you may have 
paid hundreds or thousands of dollars in premiums over the years.
Permanent insurance
Permanent insurance has quite a few aliases, such as whole life, 
universal life, and guaranteed life, but all permanent insurance 
policies have two important features. First, the insurance policy 
will remain in effect until you die, no matter how ancient you are 
by then, provided you pay your premiums. Second, the policy 
combines insurance with a savings feature. Some of your premium 
dollars pay the life insurance costs, but some are invested so that 
your policy has a cash surrender value that goes up as time goes 
by. If you decide to cancel the policy, the insurance company will 
pay you the cash surrender value of your policy.
 
Permanent insurance is promoted by insurance companies as 
having numerous advantages. However, many of these advantages 
aren’t that advantageous on closer examination. Let’s look at some 
of the claims made for permanent insurance.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
66
 
✓ Advertised advantage: Your insurance coverage will not end 
when you reach a certain age — it will continue in place until 
you die.
 
 Reality: As you get older, your need for life insurance usually 
goes down. When you reach the age at which your term insur-
ance coverage ends, you’ll probably need a lot less insurance 
than before. You may not need any at all. But if you still want 
insurance, you can get it by converting some of your term 
policy coverage into a permanent policy, or by buying a new, 
smaller permanent life insurance policy. Although the premi-
ums for a new policy when you’re older will be quite expen-
sive, the combined cost of the premiums for your original 
term policy and for the new permanent policy will probably 
be a lot lower than the permanent policy premiums you would 
pay over the length of the larger permanent policy.
 
✓ Advertised advantage: You have an investment as well as 
insurance, and a tax-deferred investment at that — the cash 
value grows over time, and you don’t have to pay income tax 
on what your policy earns unless you take the earnings out 
before you die.
 
 Reality: Insurance is not a very good investment. Other invest-
ments earn a lot more money than a permanent insurance 
policy. And while it’s true that the earnings on a permanent 
policy are tax-deferred, investing in an RRSP is a much better 
way to get a tax deferral. With an RRSP, the money you invest 
is deductible from income, you will almost certainly earn 
more on your investment, and the income earned is not tax-
able until you cash in the RRSP.
 
✓ Advertised advantage: Permanent insurance is a form of forced 
savings — if you’re good at paying your bills but not good 
about saving money, at least part of your insurance bill is 
going toward savings.
 
 Reality: You can participate in other forms of forced savings, 
such as payroll savings plans.
 
✓ Advertised advantage: You can borrow against the cash value 
of your policy at a reasonable rate of interest.
 
 Reality: Think about it — you’re borrowing your own money!
 
✓ Advertised advantage: The premiums don’t go up as you 
get older — they remain constant throughout the life of the 
policy.
 
 Reality: Instead of having a policy with premiums that get very 
high when you get older, you have premiums that start high 
and stay high.

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 67
 
✓ Advertised advantage: You may not have to pay premiums at 
all after a certain number of years. If the cash surrender value 
of your policy gets high enough, instead of paying more each 
year, your premiums may be paid out of the interest earned 
on the cash surrender value.
 
 Reality: If interest rates go down and your policy doesn’t earn 
enough to cover the premiums, premiums will be deducted 
from the cash surrender value of the policy and the cash sur-
render value will go down.
The main disadvantage of permanent insurance is its cost. 
Coverage under a permanent insurance policy is much more 
expensive than the same amount of coverage under a term insur-
ance policy — as we told you above, it can be as much as ten times 
more expensive. And whether the advantages are worth the extra 
cost is questionable.
All in all, we think you’ll find that as insurance, permanent insur-
ance is too expensive, and that as an investment, it’s not great.
Variations on a theme
Although there are just two basic types of insurance, variations on 
term insurance exist, which we discuss in this section.
Joint policies
Normally if you wanted life insurance on two different people, 
you’d have two separate policies and the insurance company 
would pay up when each person died. A joint insurance policy 
insures two lives, but the insurance company only pays the face 
amount of the policy once, when one of the joint insured people 
dies — depending on the policy, the payment will be made when 
the first person dies or when the second person dies. Generally 
speaking, the premiums on a joint policy are cheaper than the pre-
miums on two separate policies. (And you’re thinking, “They darn 
well better be, since the insurance company only pays once!”)
Under a first-to-die policy, the insurance company pays the face 
amount of the policy when the first of the two insured people 
dies. You may consider taking out a first-to-die policy if you and 
another person, usually a partner or a spouse, would need money 
if the other one died. For example, if you and your spouse have a 
debt, such as a mortgage, that you need both of your incomes to 
pay, you may want enough insurance to pay off the debt if either 
one of you dies. You may also use this type of policy if you own a 
business with someone else and have an agreement that if one of 
you dies, the other will buy that partner’s share of the business 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
68
from the partner’s estate. A first-to-die policy on each other’s lives 
would give you the money to buy out your partner’s share.
Under a second-to-die policy, the insurance company pays the face 
amount of the policy when the second of the two insured people 
dies. You may consider taking out a second-to-die policy if your 
family will need money only after you and your spouse both die. 
This type of policy is most commonly used to cover capital gains 
taxes (see Chapter 3). Generally, capital gains taxes don’t have to 
be paid when the first spouse dies if that spouse leaves property 
to the other spouse; they have to be paid only when the second 
spouse dies and the property is then left to the children or others.
Mortgage insurance
If you and your spouse have a mortgage on your home, your 
mortgage lender has probably offered you the opportunity to buy 
mortgage insurance to pay off the mortgage if one spouse dies. 
Mortgage insurance is simply a first-to-die term insurance policy. 
Before you take out the policy, shop around and see if you can 
get the same amount of term insurance somewhere else for less 
money.
Accidental death insurance
Accidental death insurance is term insurance that provides cover-
age only if you die in an accident. If you die of natural causes, for 
example of a heart attack after narrowly avoiding being killed in 
an accident, your beneficiary will get nada. You can buy acciden-
tal death insurance on its own, or you can buy a double indem-
nity rider to your life insurance policy — an addition to your 
policy under which your beneficiaries will be paid double the 
face amount of the policy if you are killed accidentally. However, 
accidental death insurance is more often found as part of a travel 
insurance package that includes other things like out-of-country 
medical, trip cancellation, and lost baggage insurance — it’s term 
insurance for a very short term (the length of your trip).
Also available is flight insurance (in travel insurance packages and 
from machines at the airport). Your beneficiary only collects if 
you’re killed in a plane crash. Flight insurance is alluringly inexpen-
sive because air crashes, although extremely scary to contemplate 
and highly publicized when they occur, are very rare.
 
The bottom line about insurance that picks and chooses the way 
you’re going to die is this: You either need life insurance or you 
don’t. If you need it, you should buy ordinary term insurance and 
have coverage all the time for all possible ways of kicking the 
bucket. If you don’t need insurance, then don’t buy it, no matter 
how cheap it is or how nervous you are about having an accident.

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 69
Figuring Out Where and How 
to Get Life Insurance
Where you go looking for a life insurance policy and how you get 
it depends on whether you have in mind individual insurance or 
group insurance. Individual insurance is a contract between the 
owner of the policy and an insurance company, and any individual 
can apply for coverage from any insurance company. Group insur-
ance is a contract between a group (such as a company, a trade 
union, a professional organization) and a particular insurance com-
pany. Only members of the group (the employees, the union mem-
bers, the professionals) are eligible to apply for coverage from the 
insurance company.
Permanent insurance is available only through individual poli-
cies, while term insurance is available through either individual or 
group policies.
Individual insurance
When you buy individual insurance, you have several decisions 
to make. You have to decide which insurance company you want 
to deal with. Then you have to decide whether to buy your insur-
ance directly from the insurance company or through an agent or 
broker. And if you decide to work with an agent or broker you have 
to decide which agent or broker to use.
Selecting which insurance company to deal with
A major factor in your choice of insurance company will be which 
company offers you the most reasonable rate for the insurance 
you want. You should get quotes from several insurers before you 
buy a policy. We tell you more about how to comparison shop 
under the heading “Finding Out How Much Life Insurance Costs” 
later in this chapter.
Another factor you should take into account is the financial health 
of the insurance company. The insurance industry is very highly 
regulated, and the provincial governments examine an insurance 
company’s financial health when they decide whether or not the 
company should be (or should continue to be) licensed to carry 
on business. If you’re concerned about the financial condition of 
a particular insurance company, you can get information from an 
insurance broker, from the Canadian Life and Health Insurance 
Association, and from reports issued by rating agencies such as 
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., and Standard and Poor’s Corp.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
70
You’re going to be with your chosen insurance company for a 
long time . . . you hope. You don’t want to monitor the company’s 
financial health hourly as you would an Internet stock. So you’ll 
be relieved to learn that, although life insurance policies are not 
insured by the federal government the way bank or trust company 
deposits are, all life insurance companies that conduct business 
in Canada contribute to a fund that compensates policyholders if 
their insurance company fails. If your insurance company doesn’t 
last as long as you do, the fund will pay up to $200,000 or 85 per-
cent of the face value, whichever is higher, for each life insured at 
any one company. If you need more than $200,000 of life insurance, 
you won’t be fully protected if you have all of your insurance with 
one company. Your alternative is to have several policies of no 
more than $200,000 with different companies, but this will proba-
bly cost more than having one policy for the full amount you need.
A final factor in your choice of insurance company is how you want 
to buy your insurance — from an agent or a broker, or directly 
from a company.
Choosing an agent or broker, or buying direct
Most life insurance is sold through agents and brokers who earn 
commissions based on the amount and kind of insurance they sell. 
But more and more insurance companies are selling their policies 
directly to the public.
 
Agents and brokers work for themselves or for insurance agencies 
or brokerages, not for the insurance company. They are regulated 
and licensed by provincial governments. We use the term insur-
ance agent to mean a person who deals with only one insurance 
company and sells only that company’s policies. We use the term 
insurance broker to mean a person who deals with and sells the 
policies of several companies. A broker can get quotes for you 
from several companies, while an agent can get you insurance only 
from one. So if you choose to work with an agent, make sure that 
you have checked out the insurance company as well as the agent.
You can buy directly from an insurance company, for example 
through the company’s Web site or over the phone. You can also 
buy insurance from one of the banks or trust companies that have 
set up insurance departments. Their staff is usually made up of 
salaried employees rather than commission-earning salespeople — 
however, it’s their job to sell insurance for their employer. You 
may pay less for the policy because you’ll be dealing with staff who 
are employed by the insurance company rather than with indepen-
dent salespeople, but do some comparison shopping to make sure.

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 71
If you decide to buy insurance through an agent or broker, he or 
she can give you advice about
 
✓ How much insurance you need
 
✓ The kind of policy to buy
 
✓ Completing the formal application process
If you buy directly from an insurance company you may be on your 
own here.
When you’re dealing with insurance agents and brokers, keep in 
mind that the insurance company pays them a commission for 
each policy they sell. Generally speaking, the more expensive the 
policy, the higher the commission, and commissions for perma-
nent policies are a lot higher than the commissions for term poli-
cies. This makes trying to sell you more insurance than you need 
rather tempting for an agent or broker. Also, the more insurance 
a broker sells for a particular company, the higher the rate of 
the broker’s commission, so even an independent broker may be 
inclined to push one insurance company’s products over another’s.
These facts of insurance life make it very important for you to be 
careful in choosing an agent or broker to deal with. So how do you 
find a trustworthy one? Ask for recommendations from your family 
and friends, from your lawyer or accountant, or from the agent 
or broker you deal with for your car or home insurance (if you’ve 
been satisfied with his or her work). Once you have a recommen-
dation, speak to the agent or broker:
 
✓ Find out about his or her experience and qualifications. Some 
agents and brokers hold various professional designations, 
such as Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU), Chartered Financial 
Planner (CFP), and Chartered Financial Consultant (CHFC). 
These designations mean that the agent or broker has taken 
courses and examinations in insurance and financial planning 
topics.
 
✓ Ask for references from other clients if you’d like to know 
more about an agent or broker’s past performance.
 
✓ Get a sense of whether the agent or broker is someone you 
can trust and feel comfortable working with.
 
After you’ve chosen a person, don’t just blindly follow the advice 
you are given. Ask lots of questions, such as how the agent or 
broker arrived at the recommended amount of insurance, why the 
broker is recommending one insurance company over another, 
and how much commission is payable on any particular policy.

Getting individual insurance
To apply for individual insurance, you’ll have to fill out a form that 
asks your age and sex, and detailed questions about
 
✓ Your current health
 
✓ Your medical history
 
✓ Your family’s medical history as it relates to any hereditary 
medical conditions
 
✓ Your past and present use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs
 
✓ Your past and present participation in dangerous activities, 
such as flying (as a pilot or crew member), motor vehicle 
racing, parachuting, hang gliding, and scuba diving, and your 
intention to participate in those activities in the future
 
✓ Whether you have any other insurance policies, and whether 
you have ever applied for and been denied insurance coverage
You will also have to sign a consent form authorizing all of your 
doctors to disclose information about your medical history to the 
insurance company. Depending on your age, your medical history, 
and the amount of insurance you are applying for, you may have to 
undergo a medical examination by a doctor or nurse chosen by the 
insurance company.
 
Be absolutely honest in filling out the application form and in 
answering any questions asked during your medical examination. If 
you make a mistake, leave out information, or tell a lie, your insur-
ance company may have the right to terminate the policy for up to 
two years after the policy comes into effect. After two years, the 
insurance company still has the right to terminate your policy for 
wrong information, but only if you were trying to defraud the insur-
ance company.
If the insurance company approves your application, the insurance 
policy does not take effect unless
 
✓ A copy of the policy has been delivered to you, your agent, or 
your beneficiary
 
✓ The first premium has been paid
 
✓ There has been no change in your health or lifestyle that 
would affect the insurance company’s decision to insure you 
between the time your application was completed and the 
time the policy was delivered

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 73
If your application isn’t approved and you’re working with an agent 
or a broker, ask him or her to ask the insurance company for an 
explanation. If you applied for insurance directly from the insurer, 
ask the insurance company yourself.
If your application was turned down because of a medical condi-
tion, you want to know whether the insurance company relied only 
on information in your questionnaire and medical examination and 
your doctors’ records, or whether it relied on information obtained 
from the Medical Information Bureau.
The Medical Information Bureau (MIB) is an organization of 
life insurance companies that operates a medical information 
exchange on behalf of its members. Whenever you apply for insur-
ance, you consent to the insurance company giving the medical 
information they get from you to the MIB and to the MIB giving 
whatever medical information they have about you to the insur-
ance company. The MIB may have a medical file on you, just like a 
credit rating bureau may have a credit file on you. If the insurance 
company relied on information from the MIB in deciding to reject 
your application, you have the right to ask the MIB to give you any 
information it has about you. If you find a mistake, you can contact 
the MIB in Toronto to seek a correction.
 
If there has been no mistake or misunderstanding, don’t give up 
hope. Just because one insurance company has turned down your 
application doesn’t mean that every insurance company will do 
the same thing. Ask a broker to look for another company that may 
consider granting coverage to someone with your particular medi-
cal problem.
Group insurance
In order to get group life insurance, you have to belong to a 
group . . . and the group has to offer group insurance. (Have you 
noticed that this book is full of brilliant insights?)
The most common source of group insurance is an employer. If 
your employer offers group coverage, you would have been told 
about it when you were hired or when it was first introduced as 
a benefit. To be eligible for employer group insurance you gener-
ally have to be a full-time employee, although some employers 
also offer coverage to part-time employees. Usually you must 
be employed for one to three months before you are eligible for 
coverage. You must apply for coverage within a short time after 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
74
becoming eligible (as a rule, one month) or you may not be able 
to apply at all, or you may have to provide evidence that you are 
healthy.
Alternatively, you may be eligible for group life insurance through 
membership in a union or professional or other association (such 
as a university alumni association). If you are a member of such 
a group, call the organization to find out whether or not it offers 
group life and, if so, whether you are eligible for coverage and 
what the cost is.
How you go about applying for group insurance depends on the 
nature of the group.
In order to get group life insurance from your employer, you have 
to make a written application to your employer once you become 
eligible under the plan (usually one to three months after starting 
your employment). Most employer group life insurance policies 
do not require the individual members of the group to provide 
evidence of good health, and so the application form is very short. 
If you apply as soon you become eligible, your insurance will take 
effect as soon as your employer receives your written application. 
If you wait more than about a month to put in your application, 
you will probably have to fill out an insurance company form and 
perhaps even have a medical exam to satisfy the insurance com-
pany about your health and lifestyle.
If you are taking out group life insurance with a non-employer 
group, the insurance company may require proof of good health 
and lifestyle. In that case, the application form will be more 
detailed, and the approval process longer.
Finding Out How Much 
Life Insurance Costs
Insurance premiums differ in price considerably — and not just 
from insurance company to insurance company but from person to 
person.
 
How much your insurance will cost will depend on a number of fac-
tors, including the following:
 
✓ The amount of coverage you want — insurance premiums are 
quoted per thousand dollars of coverage, so the more insur-
ance you buy, the higher your premium will be.

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 75
 
✓ Whether you buy term insurance or permanent insurance — 
the cost of permanent insurance coverage can be up to ten 
times the cost of the same amount of term insurance coverage.
In this section, we consider a few other factors that affect insur-
ance costs.
Insurance rating factors
When you buy a life insurance policy, you’re placing a bet with the 
insurance company about when you’re going to die. Betting with 
an insurance company is like gambling at a casino, and the insur-
ance company is the casino. A casino that wants to stay in busi-
ness makes sure that the odds favour the house so that it doesn’t 
have to pay out more winnings than it has budgeted for.
To check that the odds remain in their favour, insurance compa-
nies collect information about the general population. Although it 
is impossible to predict when any one person will die, it is possible 
to predict quite accurately, based on death statistics, the number 
of people out of a large group who will die during a given period 
of time. If an insurance company insures a large number of people 
who as a group resemble the general population, using statistical 
mortality tables it can predict how many will die each year. Then it 
can budget for the number of claims it will probably have to pay 
and set premiums accordingly — with people who are statistically 
more likely to die in the year being charged higher premiums than 
those who are statistically less likely to die.
Insurance companies also collect information about each appli-
cant to make sure that the applicant’s risk of dying isn’t greater 
than the statistical average. (Insurers believe that people who are 
more likely to die are also more likely to want insurance, so they 
are immediately suspicious of anyone who wants to buy what 
they’re trying to sell.) This screening process is called underwrit-
ing. An underwriter decides whether a particular applicant runs 
an average risk of dying, a lower than average risk of dying, or a 
higher than average risk of dying. A person with an average risk of 
dying will be charged a standard premium. A person with a lower 
than average risk of dying will be charged a preferred premium. 
A person with a higher than average risk of dying will either be 
charged a higher premium or will be refused coverage altogether, 
depending on how high the risk is.
All of this means that an insurance company sets your premium 
according to the following rating factors:

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
76
 
✓ Your age and sex: Rates are different for sex as well as age 
because for men and women of the same age the likelihood of 
dying at any given age is different.
 
✓ Your health: People who already have certain kinds of health 
problems (just to name a few examples, cancer, heart disease, 
or emphysema; or less advanced problems such as high blood 
pressure or diabetes) are more likely than the average person 
to die sooner rather than later.
 
✓ Whether or not you smoke: Insurance company executives 
were among the first to take seriously the warnings on ciga-
rette packages that smokers are more likely than non-smokers 
to get sick and die.
 
✓ Whether or not you engage in dangerous activities: Some 
activities, such as flying small airplanes, car racing, para-
chuting, and scuba diving, are associated with a higher fatal 
accident rate than, say, walking the dog or going to a hockey 
game.
Just to give you an idea of how your rating factors affect insurance 
premiums, Table 4-1 shows the standard annual insurance premi-
ums for $100,000 of ten-year term insurance, depending on age and 
sex. The price ranges reflect the fact that not all companies charge 
exactly the same amount for a premium.

dangerous activities.

As you can see by comparing standard and preferred premiums, 
good health and a safe lifestyle become more important the older 
you get.
Comparison shop
The cost of the same amount and type of insurance coverage can 
vary widely from insurance company to insurance company, as 
Tables 4-1 and 4-2 show. And paying more may not get you any 
more in terms of reliability or service. To make sure that you don’t 
pay more than you have to, compare the prices of several insur-
ance companies.
You can compare insurance prices by
 
✓ Speaking to an insurance broker. An insurance broker who 
deals with a number of companies can find out what each 
would charge you for the same insurance. You can ask the 
broker whether there is any reason to justify a higher pre-
mium from a particular company.
 
✓ Speaking to insurance agents for several companies. Ask 
each one to tell you what their particular company would 
charge you for the insurance coverage you’re interested in. 
(But who in their right mind would want more than one insur-
ance salesperson at a time after them?)
 
✓ Using the Internet. There are Web sites that will give you 
comparative quotes. A good site is Compulife’s Term4sale 
(www.term4sale.com).

Individual insurance 
or group insurance
Almost everything we’ve told you so far about the cost of insur-
ance applies only to individual insurance policies. It does not apply 
to group life insurance policies.
If you are eligible for group life insurance, your age, sex, health, 
and lifestyle don’t affect your premiums. Everyone in the group 
is charged the same premium per dollar of insurance, so the only 
thing that will affect the cost is the amount of insurance you buy.
Group life insurance policies are convenient because, as a rule, 
you simply enroll through your company or other group and do 
not have to complete any health and lifestyle questionnaires or go 
through any form of medical examination. However, the premiums 
may not be cheaper than those for an individual life insurance 
policy, especially if you’re in good health.
Learning What a Standard 
Life Insurance Policy Says
Have you ever felt a burning desire to read a life insurance policy? 
We thought not. We didn’t feel a burning desire either, but we read 
one anyway — and now we’re going to tell you what’s in there just 
in case you never get around to looking for yourself. What’s in a 
policy depends (once again) on whether the policy is an individual 
policy or a group policy.
Individual insurance
Every individual insurance policy contains certain things:
 
✓ The name of the insurance company
 
✓ The name of the insured person
 
✓ The name of the beneficiary
 
✓ The amount of money to be paid on the death of the life 
insured (or a method for calculating the amount)
 
✓ The amount of the premium (or a method for calculating the 
premium)

 Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Life Insurance Revealed 79
 
✓  Any grace period for paying a premium — if you don’t pay 
your premium your policy will lapse (end). By statute, you 
have a grace period of at least 28 days after the due date to 
make the payment. During that period you’re still covered and 
you can still make your payment to keep the policy in force
 
✓ When the policy takes effect
 
✓ When the policy ends
Most policies also contain a clause stating that no money will be 
paid under the policy if the insured commits suicide within two 
years after the policy takes effect.
Permanent life insurance policies also include clauses dealing with 
the cash value of the policy. Term insurance policies may have 
a clause allowing the insured to convert the policy to permanent 
insurance before the policy expires.
Group insurance
In group insurance the contract is not between the insurance 
company and the individual group members whose lives are 
insured. The contract is between the insurance company and the 
group — employer company, labour union, or professional or 
other organization — known as the contracting party. Only the con-
tracting party gets a copy of the insurance contract. However, the 
insurance company must provide a certificate or other document 
for the contracting party to deliver to each group member. This 
document sets out
 
✓ The name of the insurance company
 
✓ A contract number or other identification of the contract
 
✓ The amount of insurance on the group member (or a method 
to determine the amount)
 
✓ The circumstances in which the insurance will terminate
Instead of getting a copy of a life insurance policy, the individual 
members of the group may be given a brochure setting out the 
main details of the insurance policy.

▶ Learning how to avoid gift-giving mistakes
▶ Discovering the best ways to give
G
ifts aren’t quite as innocent as they look . . . lawyers got there 
first! A gift is actually a legal transaction with a whole set of 
rules attached to it, and a whole bunch of potential problems trail-
ing behind it. In this chapter, we look at what goes into giving, and 
how to avoid giving other people headaches.
Giving Away Your Property 
While You’re Alive
Giving things away while you’re still alive is one way to make sure 
they actually get to the people you want to have them. And you 
may have other reasons for not wanting to wait until you’re dead:
 
✓ A family member or friend may need financial help now — 
why not do the generous thing? It will head off those calculat-
ing looks that accompany the greeting, “How are you?”
 
✓ You may be thinking of the pleasure it will give you to see 
your family or friends enjoying your gifts while you’re still 
alive.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
82
 
✓ Your property (especially a house or cottage) may be eating 
up too much of your money, time, and effort to keep up.
 
✓ You may entertain some strange hope that dividing up your 
property now will prevent your family from fighting over it 
after you’re dead. (And you’re right! They’ll fight with you 
instead of with each other later.)
 
✓ After reading Chapter 3 on taxes and estate planning, you may 
believe that giving a gift will provide tax advantages for you 
now or for your estate or a beneficiary when you die.
Unwrapping Gifts
 
Legally speaking, giving a gift means unconditionally transferring 
ownership and control of your property to another person. Does 
that sound like what you want to do? Or do you really want the 
recipient to do what you tell him to do with your former property?
Once you’ve made a gift of a piece of your property, you have no 
rights over the property any more, nor any say in what’s done with 
it. The person to whom you give the gift, on the other hand, now 
has all the rights over the property that you used to have. The 
new owner can sell the gift, or spend it foolishly and contrary to 
your wishes, or deliberately destroy it, or carelessly lose it, or give 
it away, or trade it for something she likes better, or pawn it, or 
mortgage it, or paint it a funny colour. Legally speaking, it’s none of 
your business what the new owner does with your gift.
Chances are, though, that emotionally and morally speaking, you 
haven’t achieved a state of total detachment from the gift. What the 
new owner of your lovely gift does with it may drive you nuts . . . 
and you won’t be able to do anything about it. Once you’ve made a 
gift, you can’t get it back — unless the new owner decides to give it 
to you as a gift, or agrees to let you buy it back.
We’re not trying to scare you. Well, yes, we are trying to scare you. 
The recipient of your gift may be happy to do exactly what you 
would like, and you’ll be pleased and the world will generally be a 
better place. But many people have given gifts that were not used 
in the way the giver anticipated, and the results have not been 
pretty — extending as far, sometimes, as a family feud that never 
healed. Be sure, before you give a gift, that you are fully aware of 
what gift giving means.

 Chapter 5: Giving Away Your Things Before You Die 83
Figuring Out How to Make a Gift
No, we’re not going all Martha Stewartish on you. We’re not talking 
crafts. We’re not even talking gift-wrapping. We’re talking about 
the elements that must be present if you want to make a valid gift. 
Only if you make a valid gift will the new owner be legally able to 
sell it, mortgage it, spend it foolishly, or do any of the other things 
that are likely to upset you.
In order for you to make a valid gift,
 
✓ You must be the owner of the property. You can’t give away 
property that belongs to your spouse or your children or that 
you own with someone else (unless you get that other per-
son’s consent).
 
✓ You must intend to make a gift. You must mean to give away 
ownership and control of the property completely and perma-
nently, not just partly or temporarily.
 
✓ You must hand over the property and/or transfer legal own-
ership (depending on the nature of the property). You must 
actually turn the property you are giving away over to the 
person you are giving it to. You have to hand the person the 
jewellery or cash, or have the furniture delivered to him or 
allow him to take it away. You have to move out of the house 
or cottage, unless you’ve been given permission to stay on or 
leave your belongings there. If the property is something that 
requires registration of ownership, such as a car, a house or 
cottage, or investments, you must sign and hand over the title 
documents as well.
 
✓ The person to whom you are making the gift must accept the 
gift — not usually a problem . . . although if the person says 
she doesn’t want it you can’t force her to take it.
Avoiding Giving Away Your 
Property without Meaning To
Now that we’ve warned you that a gift may not be exactly the ticket 
for you and your loved ones, you may be wondering if you can give 
a gift without really wanting or intending to. Sometimes you can. 
And you may or may not be able to get out of it.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
84
A gift made against your will 
is not a gift
Even if you meet all the legal requirements to make a valid gift, as 
we set out in the list above, there’s one additional requirement 
before the recipient is the undisputed owner of your property. You 
must also be making the gift voluntarily.
 
✓ You must be mentally competent. You don’t have the neces-
sary intention to make a gift unless you are able to understand 
the legal and practical meaning and consequences of making 
the gift. You may be mentally incompetent for a time because 
of anesthesia or drugs or alcohol or a head injury. You may be 
mentally incompetent permanently because of Alzheimer’s or 
a stroke or other brain damage.
 
✓ You must not be acting under duress (violence or threats of 
violence to force you to make the gift).
 
✓ You must not be acting under undue influence (pressure put 
on you to make a gift, if the pressure results from the nature 
of your relationship with the person who’d like you to make 
a gift). For example, if you’re physically frail and you rely on 
an individual to look after you, that individual’s expressed 
interest in getting a gift may be considered undue influence. In 
addition, you’ll be fascinated to know that whenever you give 
a gift to your lawyer, the law presumes that there has been 
undue influence.
If you give a gift when you are either temporarily or permanently 
mentally incompetent, or if you give a gift because you were 
threatened or felt pressured to give it, you (if you’re mentally com-
petent) or your family (if you’re not) can apply to a court to have 
your gift cancelled and returned.
A promise to give a gift is not a gift
Suppose you’re in your right mind, not under pressure, and not 
being threatened with a long walk off a short pier. Suppose that 
in a moment of affection you’ve promised to give someone some-
thing. Can you be forced to go through with your promise and 
make the gift?
If the moment of affection passes, or if you simply forget that you 
made the promise, no one can make you give the gift as long as 
you received nothing in return for your promise. Have a look at the 
story of “Ada’s piano” for more.

 Chapter 5: Giving Away Your Things Before You Die 85
But a promise to give a gift in return 
for something is a different matter
 
If you promise someone a gift, she can’t legally do anything to 
make you give it to her. However if you promise someone a gift and 
he promises you something in return or promises to do something 
valuable for you in return, there’s a change of scene. You’re out of 
the world of gifts and into the world of contracts. And in the world 
of contract law, a promise in exchange for a promise creates a 
contract that a court will agree to enforce. So you can be forced to 
go through with making the gift you promised. (Only now it’s not 
really a gift, its legal name is consideration — the thing you give in 
exchange for the thing you receive.)
You must be careful not to promise to give something to a person 
who is doing something in return, especially if the person is not 
already getting paid for doing it. Unless, of course, you actually 
want to give the person something and you’re not just making 
conversation. So if the kid next door likes to walk your dog after 
school and isn’t being paid to do so, think a minute before you say 
you’ll buy the kid her own purebred dog next Christmas. If your 
cousin, out of the goodness of his heart, picks you up and takes 
you grocery shopping every week, don’t just blurt out that if he 
keeps on taking you shopping you’d like to thank him by giving 
him your hockey puck that was autographed by Rocket Richard.
Look at “Ada’s piano, second movement” to see how the story 
might have turned out differently if something else had been said.
Ada’s piano
Ada was very fond of her 16-year-old grandniece, Flora, who visited Ada every 
weekend for tea and at the end of her visit always played the piano for Ada. One 
day, Ada said to Flora, “You play that piano so beautifully that I am going to give it 
to you for your next birthday.” Flora continued to visit Ada and play her piano, but 
on Flora’s next birthday Ada gave her a sweater. Flora was disappointed, not least 
because the sweater was something she wouldn’t be caught dead in. But she was 
well brought up and said nothing to Ada about the piano. In fact if Flora had con-
sulted a lawyer about the promised gift, she would have found that she had no legal 
right to make Ada give her the piano, despite Ada’s clear promise.

86
Planning So That You Won’t 
Live to Regret Your Gift
For now, let’s assume that you truly and genuinely want to give 
someone a gift. You still have a couple of questions to consider 
before generosity overwhelms you.
Can you afford the gift?
Once you make a gift of something, you no longer own it and you 
can’t get it back. So before you give anything away, make sure 
that you’re leaving yourself enough money and property to look 
after yourself until you die. Think not only about your current 
circumstances, but consider what your financial needs will be if 
you become ill and unable to look after yourself, or if your spouse 
needs special care. Will you still have enough?
You may be thinking about giving away something that earns 
income, such as cash that earns interest, shares that pay divi-
dends, or real estate that brings in rental income. Stop to think 
how much income the property earns for you and what income 
you will be left with if you give the property away. Will you still 
have enough income now? In the future?
You may be thinking about giving something away that doesn’t 
earn income, like jewellery or a painting, or something that costs 
Ada’s piano, second movement
In this variation on the example above, Ada said to Flora, “You play that piano so 
beautifully that I’d like to give it to you for your next birthday.”
Flora replied, “I’d like that very much. I’ll come and play the piano for you every 
weekend between now and then, and once the piano is mine I’ll invite you to my 
house.”
“That’s settled, then,” said Ada.
Flora showed up and played every weekend. In legal terms she gave her con-
sideration, and when her birthday rolled around it was Ada’s turn to give her 
consideration — to give Flora the piano as promised. Instead she gave Flora a 
sweater. In these circumstances, Flora could have sued Ada for the piano. But Ada 
was lucky. Flora was too well brought up to think of suing.

 Chapter 5: Giving Away Your Things Before You Die 87
you money to maintain, such as a cottage. Stop to think about how 
much money you might get for this property if you were to sell it. 
Do you need that money now? Might you need it in the future?
Will you have to pay 
tax on your gift?
Taxes may turn out to be another cause for regret.
In Chapter 3, we tell you that giving things away while you’re alive 
has two important possible tax advantages:
 
✓ You may reduce the capital gains tax your estate will have to 
pay when you die.
 
✓ You may reduce your income tax now.
But you may find that when you give a gift, the tax advantages 
won’t work out quite the way you’re hoping. Instead, Canada 
Revenue may come snuffling up and ask for a gift from you too.
Reduced capital gains tax later
You may be planning to give away cash, stocks, valuable artwork, 
collectibles, or real estate like a house or cottage, and you’re won-
dering whether giving these things now will relieve your estate of 
some of the tax burden.
There is no capital gains tax payable, ever, on cash, GICs, or trea-
sury bills because cash, or any investment that is essentially cash, 
does not go up in value. Your estate won’t pay capital gains tax on 
such things when you die. So there’s no capital gains tax advantage 
to giving a gift of cash.
By disposing of property that does go up in value (investments, 
artwork, real estate), you may be reducing capital gains payable 
on your death. On the other hand, you may have to pay capital 
gains tax yourself now, if the property has increased in value since 
you got it. If the gift is to your spouse you won’t pay any capital 
gains tax because of the spousal rollover (see Chapter 3). But if 
your spouse sells the property at a profit before you die, Canada 
Revenue has the power to attribute the capital gain back to you; in 
other words, make you, rather than your spouse, pay the capital 
gains tax.
If you have to pay capital gains tax, the amount will be calculated 
as if you had sold the property at fair market value, even though 
you are actually giving it away. It doesn’t make much sense to pay 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
88
tax now rather than later — especially since you have no profit 
from a sale to pay tax with — unless
 
✓ You believe that the property will increase a lot in value 
between now and the time of your death, and for whatever 
reason you don’t want your estate to have to pay tax on the 
entire gain from the time you acquired the property to the 
time you die.
 
✓ You have a capital loss that you can use to offset the capital 
gain and reduce the tax payable.
Reduced income tax now
You may want to give away property or an investment that is gen-
erating income for you because you don’t need the income and 
you’d rather not pay the associated income tax. You probably 
want to give the income-producing property to someone who will 
pay tax in a lower tax bracket, thus rescuing part of the income 
from the claws of the government.
 
There could be some bad news here. Even though the new owner 
of the property will receive the income from the property, you 
may still have to pay the tax on it. Depending on whom you give 
the property to, Canada Revenue might think you were trying to 
income-split (share income within a family unit in order to reduce 
the tax payable on it) and might attribute the income back to you 
and tax you as if the income continues to be yours.
If you give income-producing property to your spouse or to a 
trust for your spouse, the tax authorities have the power to tax 
you on any interest, dividend, or capital gains income from that 
property in the future. If you give income-producing property to 
a child or grandchild under the age of 18, the tax department has 
the power to tax you on any interest or dividend income (but not 
capital gains) from the property in the future. Some good news — 
you cannot be taxed on the income earned by property that you 
transfer to your adult child or grandchild, or to a friend or passing 
stranger.
Discovering Safer Ways 
Than Giving a Gift
You love your family and your friends . . . but if you don’t trust 
them any further than you could throw a woolly mammoth, then 
maybe a gift is not the best way to show your love. Luckily, there 
are alternatives.

 Chapter 5: Giving Away Your Things Before You Die 89
A loan
If a family member or friend needs money to make a major pur-
chase such as a house or a car, you could make a loan instead of a 
gift. Your loan can be accompanied by a promissory note (a prom-
ise to repay), with a repayment schedule drawn up to reflect the 
borrower’s financial circumstances. You can charge interest if you 
like (less than a bank would charge, if you’re feeling kind), or make 
the loan interest-free (if you’re feeling extra kind). If you receive 
interest, you’re supposed to report it in your income tax return.
If your friend or relative knows that the money is supposed to go 
back to you some day, she’ll probably be more careful about what 
she does with it . . . even if there’s a chance that you’ll someday 
forgive the loan.
If the loan is to buy a house or cottage and you’d like more reas-
surance that the money will come back to you, you can have a 
mortgage registered against the property for the amount of the 
loan. That will give you the right to take and sell it if the loan is not 
paid. If you want to do the business properly, you should have the 
property appraised to make sure that its value is at least equal to 
the value of your loan plus any other mortgages on the property. 
That way, if the property ever has to be sold you should be able to 
get your money back.
If the loan is for a car, you can register a security interest against 
the car. Like a mortgage, a security interest gives you the right to 
take and sell the car if the loan isn’t paid.
 
If you’re thinking along the lines of either a mortgage or a security 
interest, you need to chat with a lawyer.
A rental
Instead of giving a house or cottage to someone who needs or 
wants it, you could hang on to the property as owner but rent it 
out to your family member or friend. If you aren’t particularly con-
cerned about income, you can even let him or her live there rent-
free. If you do receive rental payments, you’re supposed to report 
them as income in your tax return.
An investment
If you’re lending money to help out with a business venture, you 
can use a promissory note to encourage repayment, or you can 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
90
even ask for security in the form of a mortgage on the borrower’s 
home in the amount of the loan. In addition or instead, if the busi-
ness is incorporated you can take back shares in the corporation, 
which could pay you dividends as the corporation became more 
successful and/or give you some measure of control over the cor-
poration’s affairs. These are matters you should speak to a lawyer 
about.
A sale
Instead of making a loan of your property, you could sell the prop-
erty to your relative or friend for its full value on the open market 
or for as little as you like. You’d have to pay capital gains tax if 
the property has gone up in value since you got it. If you sell your 
property to a close relative, you would have to calculate the capi-
tal gain as if you sold the property for its current fair market value 
even if you’re actually selling it to your relative for less. (Note, 
though, that if what you’re selling is your principal residence no 
capital gains tax is payable. See Chapter 3.)
The purchaser wouldn’t necessarily have to pay you right away 
but could instead give you a promissory note, promising to pay at 
a later time or in installments. (If you were paid in installments you 
would be able to spread out any capital gain — and therefore any 
capital gains tax payable — over a period of up to five years.) You 
may want to register a mortgage against real property that you sell 
but don’t get paid for in full immediately.
Someone who purchases your property, even for less than its 
value, is probably more likely to take care of it than someone who 
gets the property for free as a gift.
RESPs
If you want to pay something toward a child’s education and you’re 
afraid that the money you put in the kid’s savings account may end 
up invested in computer games or snowboarding vacations, try 
a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP). An RESP is a federal 
government strategy to let you save for a child’s post-secondary 
education. You can start a plan for a child as soon as it’s born 
and contribute any amount you want each year up to a maximum 
of $50,000. The income earned in the plan by your contributions 
is tax-free for you — it’s taxed in the hands of the child once the 
child registers in a post-secondary program and starts to withdraw 
the money. However, unlike an RRSP, your contributions to the 
plan are not tax-deductible.

 Chapter 5: Giving Away Your Things Before You Die 91
The federal government has decided to dote on your young rela-
tives too, and it has promised to add a grant of up to $400 per year 
to each child’s plan up to a maximum of $7,200.
Co-ownership
Another way to make a gift directly to a friend or family member 
without giving up total control is to give away a share in the prop-
erty rather than giving away the entire property. If you own a 
cottage alone, you could transfer ownership of the cottage from 
yourself to yourself and the family member. If you have an invest-
ment account or money in a bank account, you could transfer own-
ership of the account from yourself to yourself and the friend.
If you decide to give away a share of your property, in all prov-
inces other than Quebec you and the other person can own the 
property as either joint tenants or as tenants-in-common. (In Quebec 
there is no joint tenancy.) If you decide to own the property as 
joint tenants, when you die your share in the property will auto-
matically pass to the surviving owner, no matter what your will 
says. The property does not become part of your estate. So if you 
change your ownership to joint tenancy you kill two birds with one 
stone — you give away a half-interest in your property now and 
arrange to give the other half interest when you die. If you own the 
property as tenants-in-common, your share of the property is part 
of your estate when you die and passes under your will.
If you give away only a share of your property, you’re still an 
owner. You still get to use the property and to have a say in what 
happens to it. The amount of control you have depends on the 
kind of property involved.
If you become an owner together with someone else of a home or 
cottage or other real estate, both owners have an equal right to 
use the entire property, and neither owner can keep the other out 
of any part of the property. Either co-owner can sell her share of 
the property without the other owner’s permission (this may not 
be true if the co-owner is your spouse and the property is your 
family home) — although to tell you the truth it will be almost 
impossible to find someone who will want to buy just a share of 
the property. Either owner can start court proceedings to force the 
sale of the entire property. (It is possible to change these arrange-
ments by entering into a co-ownership agreement.) You’ll need to 
see a lawyer about transferring real estate into joint ownership.
If you become a joint owner of a bank account or investment 
account (much like a joint owner of real estate), ordinarily either 
owner has access to the entire balance in the account. As a result 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
92
you may find that you’ve given the whole account away even 
though you only intended to give half. You can arrange with the 
bank or investment company that both account holders must 
agree (usually by signing the withdrawal form) before any money 
can be withdrawn by either of them.
A trust
You can put property such as investments or real estate into a 
living trust, and the trust holds the property for the beneficiaries 
you name. Then you name the trustees who look after the property 
(you can name yourself) and give them instructions about how to 
handle the property. Living trusts are a great invention for big-time 
control freaks, but they’re expensive to set up (lawyers again) so 
the property has to be worth a lot . . . and so do you.
 
Trusts have another little problem. If you put income-producing 
property into the trust and then name your spouse or minor chil-
dren or grandchildren as the beneficiaries of the trust, the tax 
authorities can attribute the income back to you and make you pay 
the tax on it as if it were your own income.
If a trust sounds like the very thing for you, your whole soul 
will vibrate with excitement to hear that the entire Chapter 6 is 
devoted to trusts.

Getting Acquainted with Trusts
A trust is a vehicle for giving property away but still keeping some 
control over it. Instead of giving the property directly to the 
person you want to have the use of it (the beneficiary), you (the 
settlor) give the property to a trustee, who carries out your instruc-
tions about how to manage the property for the use of the benefi-
ciary. You can set up a trust during your lifetime or arrange for one 
to be set up after your death.
The whole idea of trusts is a bit weird because once the trust is 
set up, the property is owned in two different ways by two differ-
ent kinds of people. The trustee is the legal owner of the property, 
and the beneficiary is the beneficial owner of the property. But the 
beneficiary can’t get his hands on the property except for the bits 
that the trustee doles out. And the trustee can’t do anything with 
the property except what she has been told to do by the settlor’s 
instructions.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
94
To add to the weirdness, even though you create a trust by giving 
property to the trustee and not to “the trust,” the trust itself has 
an existence separate from the trustee and the beneficiary. The 
trust has to file tax returns and pay the trustee, and is responsible 
for paying for any professional services the trust requires (such as 
legal, accounting, and investing services) and for paying to main-
tain property in the trust (painting a cottage, for example).
More about the players
You can have more than one beneficiary for your trust, and 
the beneficiaries can either be named individuals (for example, 
Margaret Kerr and JoAnn Kurtz — feel free to make us the ben-
eficiaries of your trust, since no one else has yet) or members of 
a class (for example, “my children” or “my grandchildren”). You 
can even have second-choice beneficiaries, who can step in if your 
first-choice beneficiaries die before the trust comes to an end.
You can also have more than one trustee for your trust. Trustees 
can be humans or they can be trust companies (more about this 
later in this chapter under the heading “Finding a Trustee You Can 
Trust”), or you can have both together.
And you, the settlor, can be a trustee if you’re alive when the trust 
is created. Then you’ve really got things wrapped up — you can 
give yourself instructions about what to do with the property and 
you can carry them out. But no matter how hard a time you’re 
having letting go of worldly things, you cannot be a trustee after 
you’re dead.
More about the property
Any kind of property can be put into a trust, including a house or 
cottage or art or musical instruments or racehorses. Settlors usu-
ally put into trust property that will produce income in the form of 
interest, dividends, rent, or royalties, such as
 
✓ Cash from a bank account, from the sale of property, or from 
the proceeds of an insurance policy
 
✓ Shares in a corporation or mutual funds
 
✓ Commercial real estate
 
✓ Rights to a book, a song, a play, or a movie

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 95
Deciding Whether a Trust Is Right 
for You and Your Family
If you want to give your property to someone, why not just give it 
and be done with it? If you read Chapter 5 about giving a gift, you’ll 
know some of the things that can go wrong with a gift. Setting up 
a trust is one answer to the problems that may arise from giving 
a gift straight out. In addition, only a trust will allow you to keep 
a specific sum of money or identified property together for a long 
time after your death and to be sure that it’s used as you wish.
Trusts are most commonly set up for two particular reasons. The 
first reason is that the settlor wants to keep the beneficiary or 
those acting for the beneficiary from having total control over the 
property either for a period of time or permanently.
If the beneficiary is mentally disabled, or simply can’t be trusted 
to handle the money, the settlor may want to keep the benefi-
ciary from ever having control over the property. In that case, 
the trustee may be instructed to keep the money invested for the 
benefit of the beneficiary until his or her death, at which time 
the money and any accumulated income is to be paid to a differ-
ent beneficiary. Have a look at the sidebar “Charlie’s trust” for an 
example.
Estella has expectations for Pip
Estella was a wealthy woman who took an interest in her deceased husband’s 
young cousin, Philip (usually known as Pip), who often dropped by to play cards 
with her. Pip’s parents were both dead and Pip’s guardians were his sister (who 
was abusive) and her husband (who was fond of a drink). Estella believed firmly in 
the value of a good education. She wanted to help Pip, but she was afraid that she 
might not live until Pip grew up. She also knew that if she gave the money directly to 
Pip an official of the provincial government would have to manage it until Pip turned 
18 (see the “Trust for a minor” section later in this chapter) and she had little faith 
in government officials. She had even less faith in Pip’s sister and her husband, so 
she couldn’t give the money to them to spend on Pip.
Estella decided to put a sum of money in trust for Pip, and she instructed the trustee 
to keep the money invested for Pip’s benefit (to pay for schooling and suitable cloth-
ing) until he was 21 years old. Estella also instructed that when Pip turned 21, any 
money remaining in the trust was to be paid directly to him.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
96
The second reason for setting up a trust is that the settlor wants one 
beneficiary to have the use of the property in the short term, but 
wants another beneficiary to become owner of the property at a later 
date. The sidebar “Luke’s trust for Jackie” deals with that scenario.
Investigating the Different 
Kinds of Trusts
There are two main types of trusts — testamentary trusts and 
living trusts. Testamentary trusts are much more common than 
living trusts.
A testamentary trust is created in the settlor’s will and comes into 
effect when the settlor dies. The will names the beneficiaries of the 
trust and the trustee(s) and sets out instructions. The property in 
a testamentary trust comes from the settlor’s estate.
A living trust (also called an inter vivos trust — Latin for “between 
the living”) is set up while the settlor is still alive. It comes into 
effect as soon as the settlor signs a document called a trust agree-
ment, which names the beneficiaries and trustee(s) and contains 
the instructions, and transfers property to the trustee. A living 
trust can be set up to continue after the settlor’s death.
 
Either kind of trust has to be set up by a lawyer in order to avoid 
practical, legal, and tax problems.
Charlie’s trust
Dr. Bruner has two sons, Raymond and Charlie. Raymond makes a good living sell-
ing vintage cars, but Charlie is autistic and needs constant professional care and 
supervision. Doc Bruner wants to make sure that Charlie will be properly looked 
after whether he (the Doc) is alive or not. So he puts $3 million into a trust and 
instructs the trustee to use the income, and capital as necessary, to pay for Charlie 
to live at a very expensive and well-run institution. Since there is no reason to tie 
up the money after Charlie’s death, Doc Bruner instructs the trustee to pay out all 
money in the trust to Raymond when Charlie dies. If Raymond dies before Charlie, 
Doc Bruner instructs that the money is to be paid out to his favourite charity, the 
Wapner Law Foundation.

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 97
Both a testamentary and a living trust can be discretionary, which 
means that the trustee is given the power to decide how much 
income to pay the beneficiary in any year, and may even be given 
the power to pay out some of the capital of the trust if the income 
alone isn’t enough for the beneficiary’s needs. Or a trust can be 
non-discretionary. That means that the trustee can pay out only the 
specific amounts stated in the document that sets up the trust.
Testamentary trusts
Most wills contain some form of testamentary trust. Testamentary 
trusts come in different flavours. They include:
 
✓ A spousal trust — to provide for a spouse until his or her death
 
✓ A trust for a minor — to provide for a beneficiary under the 
age of 18
 
✓ A spendthrift trust — to provide for a beneficiary who has 
trouble handling money responsibly
 
✓ A special needs trust — to provide for a beneficiary who is 
physically or mentally unable to look after his or her own 
financial affairs
 
✓ A trust for a charity — to provide for a family member until 
his or her death, and then to give the property to a charity
Spousal trust
When you set up a spousal trust, you instruct the trustee to invest 
the trust property and pay some or all of the income earned to 
your spouse until he or she dies. Then the trustee is instructed to 
give the trust property to someone else, typically your children or 
grandchildren, or a charity.
Luke’s trust for Jackie
Nobody can figure out what Luke does for a living, but he sure does own a lot of 
blue-chip corporate shares. He wants to make sure that his wife, Jackie (who has 
recently been diagnosed with cancer), has a comfortable income until she dies if 
something happens to him, but he also wants to leave some property to his girl-
friend, Isabel. So in his will he has set up a trust for the shares, giving instructions 
to the trustee to pay any interest and dividends generated by the shares to Jackie 
during her lifetime, and to hand the shares over to Isabel on Jackie’s death.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
98
You may want to set up a spousal trust (as in “Harry and Sally”) if
 
✓ Your spouse is unable to look after his or her own financial 
affairs properly because of illness, disability, or simple lack of 
knowledge and experience.
 
✓ You think that your spouse will remarry, and you want to 
make sure that the property in your estate will ultimately go 
to your children and/or grandchildren rather than to your 
spouse’s next spouse.
 
✓ You have children from a previous relationship and you want 
to look after your spouse after you die but you also want to 
make sure that your estate will ultimately go to your own chil-
dren and/or grandchildren rather than your spouse’s.
 
✓ You want to reduce the tax your spouse will pay on the 
income earned by your estate. (Your spouse and the trust 
will each file separate income tax returns and each may pay 
income tax at a lower tax rate than if all of the income were 
reported on one tax return. See the section “Paying the Taxes 
Associated with a Trust” later in this chapter.)
Trust for a minor
 
You should include a trust in your will if you want to leave any of 
your property to someone who may still be under the age of major-
ity when you die. If you leave property directly to a minor, by law 
it must be managed by the provincial government until the minor 
comes of age at 18 or 19, depending on the province.
In a trust for a minor, you instruct the trustee to invest the trust 
property and to pay all or part of the income earned by the trust 
property to the beneficiary until he or she reaches the age of major-
ity (or even older). When the beneficiary reaches the age you spec-
ify, the trustee gives the trust property directly to the beneficiary.
Harry and Sally
Harry’s first wife died after they had been married for 40 years. Two years later, 
Harry met (and married) Sally, whose husband had died five years before. They have 
been married for five years now and have been very happy together. Unfortunately, 
neither Sally nor her children are particularly fond of Harry’s children, Marie and 
Jess. Sally has assured Harry that if he dies first, she will leave anything she gets 
from Harry to his children. But Harry is worried that after he’s gone, Sally’s children 
will persuade her to change her mind and leave everything to them instead. Harry 
decides to set up a spousal trust in his will and instruct his trustee to pay the annual 
income from the trust to Sally, with the property of the trust to be divided between 
Marie and Jess when Sally dies.

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 99
The trustee’s instructions about the payment of income to the ben-
eficiary can vary. For example, you may instruct the trustee to
 
✓ Pay the beneficiary all of the income earned by the trust every 
year.
 
✓ Pay only as much of the income earned by the trust as the 
trustee believes is appropriate, and to reinvest what’s left 
over.
 
✓ Pay out some of the capital if the trustee believes that the 
beneficiary should be paid more than the trust earns in 
income in any year.
 
✓ Use the income of the trust to pay only certain types of 
expenses, such as school fees.
The trustee’s instructions about turning over the trust property 
to the beneficiary can also vary. You may instruct the trustee to 
turn over all of the trust property to the beneficiary as soon as 
he reaches the age of majority or to wait until the beneficiary is 
older (and presumably wiser . . . of course he may be wiser about 
the wrong things). Or the trustee may be instructed to turn over 
the trust property in stages, for example half when the beneficiary 
turns 21 and half when she turns 25.
 
The trustee’s instructions must be properly worded or the benefi-
ciary may be able to get a court to order the trustee to turn over 
all of the property to her as soon as she reaches the age of major-
ity, even though the will says to wait until the beneficiary is older.
Spendthrift trusts
You may want to set up a spendthrift trust if you want to help sup-
port an adult child who has a history of failed business ventures 
or investments; has problems with gambling, alcohol, or drugs; or 
who simply has a money-squandering personality.
In a spendthrift trust, you instruct the trustee to invest the trust 
property and pay some or all of the income earned by the trust 
property to the beneficiary until the beneficiary dies. At that point 
the trustee is instructed to give the trust property to someone 
else, such as the beneficiary’s children or a charity. The sidebar 
“The Finsbury trust” provides an anecdote about a spendthrift 
trust.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
100
Special needs trust
In a special needs trust, you instruct the trustee to invest the trust 
property and use some or all of the income it earns to look after 
the needs of the beneficiary until the beneficiary dies. When that 
happens, the trustee is instructed to give the trust property to 
someone else, such as another family member or a charity.
 
A special needs trust, like any trust, can be discretionary or non-
discretionary — in other words, the settlor (that’s you) can state 
how much is to be paid in any year to the beneficiary or can let 
the trustee use his own judgment about how much to pay out. But 
this matter must be given very careful thought if the beneficiary 
is receiving government assistance or services as a result of his 
disability. Eligibility for government assistance is usually tied to 
financial need, and the beneficiary’s right to receive income from 
the special needs trust may put his right to assistance in jeopardy. 
In some provinces it may be possible for the beneficiary to stay eli-
gible for assistance as long as the trust is discretionary.
 
If you are thinking about setting up a special needs trust in your 
will, you should consult with a lawyer who has experience working 
with people who are disabled and their families.
Trust for a charity
A trust for a charity is any trust in which a charity is named to 
receive the trust property after the first beneficiary (the benefi-
ciary who was getting the income) dies. We’ll tell you more about 
trusts for charities in Chapter 10.
The Finsbury trust
Morris Finsbury has two sons, Joseph and Masterman. Masterman is a wealthy 
and successful businessman. Joseph, on the other hand, has never found a place 
for himself in the business world. He is more interested in making statistical studies 
of obscure facts that rarely, if ever, have a commercial pay-off. He and his family 
manage to survive on the salary of his amazingly patient wife.
Masterman has told Morris that he has enough money and he should not leave 
any of his estate to him. Morris is concerned that if he leaves his estate outright to 
Joseph, he will waste it on fact-finding missions. Morris therefore decides to leave 
his estate in trust for Joseph. He instructs his trustee to keep his estate invested 
and to pay as much of the income as the trustee thinks is reasonable to Joseph 
to provide for himself and his family in any year, and to reinvest any income left 
over. When Joseph dies, the property of the trust is to be paid to his two children, 
Michael and Julia.

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 101
Living trusts
People, usually rich people, can use living trusts in a number of 
ways, but only a few of them are directly related to estate planning. 
We cover those ways in this section.
Creating an estate freeze
We tell you about estate freezes in Chapter 3. To recap, estate 
freezes are used to reduce the capital gains tax payable by the 
present owner on capital property expected to increase in value. 
The present owner may have to pay capital gains tax when she 
transfers the property to someone else, but whoever receives the 
property (usually a spouse, child, or grandchild) will have to pay 
the capital gains tax on any future increase in value.
Although you can do an estate freeze by giving the property 
directly to your children or grandchildren (or to whomever else 
you may want to have it), if you don’t want their sticky fingers all 
over the property you can put it into trust for them instead.
If you use a trust for an estate freeze, there’s a slight variation on 
the capital gains tax story (see Chapter 3 for the scoop on capital 
gains tax). When you set up the trust, you’ll have to pay capital 
gains tax as if you had sold the property at its fair market value 
when you handed it over to the trust. That part doesn’t change. 
But afterwards, it could be the beneficiaries who have to pay any 
future capital gains tax, or it could be the trust itself.
 
✓ If the trustee sells the property and keeps the sale money in 
the trust, the trust will pay the tax.
 
✓ If the trustee sells the property and pays the sale money to 
the beneficiary, the trustee decides whether the trust or the 
beneficiary will pay the tax.
 
✓ When the trust ends and the trustee transfers the property 
in the trust to the beneficiary, no tax is payable by either the 
beneficiary or the trust. If the beneficiary afterward sells the 
property or disposes of it in some other way, the beneficiary 
is subject to capital gains tax.
 
If you give income-producing property directly to your spouse, the 
tax authorities have the power to tax you on any interest, dividend, 
or capital gain from that property in the future. (You can read 
more about this in Chapter 3.) If you give income-producing prop-
erty to a child or grandchild under the age of 18, the tax authori-
ties have the power to tax you on any interest or dividend (but not 
capital gain) from that property in the future. These things are also 
true if you put the income-producing property into a trust.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
102
Keeping a gift confidential
Your will becomes a public document when you die. Anyone can 
ask to see the copy kept at the provincial surrogate court office. 
Maybe you have a mistress or a child you never got around to 
mentioning to your spouse. You’d like to give something to your 
mistress or child when you die, but you don’t want your family to 
have a cow when your will is read and you don’t want to become a 
myth in your former neighbourhood as a two-faced swine.
The answer for you is a living trust. If you set up a living trust, the 
property you put into the trust will never become part of your 
estate, and nobody except your trustee and the beneficiary needs 
to know anything about the arrangement. Of course, this is expen-
sive and you may actually prefer to horrify your grieving relatives 
with your secret life.
Looking after someone with special needs
A living special needs trust serves exactly the same purpose as a 
testamentary special needs trust. You may want to set up a living 
trust that will continue after you die. That way you won’t be won-
dering whether the matter will be properly taken care of when 
you’re no longer around to oversee it.
Giving to charity
It is possible to set up a trust in which you get the income from the 
trust property for as long as you (and your spouse) are alive and 
the charity gets the trust property after you (or after you and your 
spouse) die. This kind of trust is called a charitable remainder trust.
Why would you do this? It looks even weirder than the usual run of 
trusts. Well, you probably wouldn’t do this.
It’s true that you will get a tax credit for the donation when you set 
up the trust, but the credit is not likely to equal the full value of the 
property you give. The credit is discounted to take into account 
the fact that the actual change in ownership will not take place 
until some time in the future. But of course it’s also true that when 
you put the property into the trust you are deemed to have dis-
posed of it for income tax purposes. If the property has gone up in 
value since you acquired it, you will have to pay tax on the capital 
gain. The tax payable on the capital gain may well be greater than 
the tax credit for the donation.
So why are we even mentioning this dang-fool notion? Some people 
in Canada try to promote it because it works okay in the United 
States, where tax laws are different.

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 103
Avoiding probate fees
If you set up a living trust, the property you give to the trust is no 
longer part of your estate, so it won’t be taken into account in cal-
culating your estate’s probate fees. (We tell you more about pro-
bate fees in Chapter 3.)
But if the property has gone up in value since you acquired it, the 
saving in probate fees later will probably not be as large as the 
tax you will have to pay now on the capital gain. So this is kind of 
a stupid idea — unless you know that the value of the property is 
really going to take off sky-high between the time you set up the 
trust and the time you die. This is another scheme that worked 
better somewhere else. Probate fees aren’t very high in Canada, 
but death duties in some other countries can be crippling.
Finding a Trustee You Can Trust
When you create a trust, you give legal ownership of your property 
to a trustee. This isn’t as much of a gamble as you might think. 
The trustee has the settlor, via the trust agreement or will, and the 
provincial government, via statute law, looking over his, her, or its 
shoulder. Not to mention the beneficiaries watching like hawks.
Looking at what a trustee does
It is the trustee’s job to
 
✓ Manage the trust property, which might include buying and 
selling property and making investments.
 
✓ Pay out the income of the trust to the beneficiaries and trans-
fer ownership of the property in the trust in accordance with 
the settlor’s instructions.
 
✓ Account to the beneficiaries — that is, inform the beneficia-
ries in writing what property was received from the settlor, 
what income was earned by the trust property, what profits 
were made on the sale of trust property, and what money was 
paid out or what property was given to the beneficiaries. The 
trustee usually provides accounts when asking to be paid 
her fee.
 
✓ File income tax returns on behalf of the trust every year until 
the trust is wound up and to pay the tax out of the money in 
the trust.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
104
Checking out the legal responsibilities 
of a trustee
A trustee has to
 
✓ Follow the settlor’s instructions set out in the trust agreement 
or will.
 
✓ Obey provincial laws about trusts.
 
✓ Act with the highest level of trust, loyalty, and honesty (sorry 
if that disqualifies three-quarters of your relatives and half of 
your friends).
 
✓ Handle the property of the estate in the way a reasonably 
prudent business person would handle his or her own 
affairs (this probably disqualifies the rest of your friends 
and relations).
 
✓ Act in the best interest of the beneficiaries — and not play 
favourites if there are some beneficiaries who are entitled to 
the income from the trust and different ones who are entitled 
to receive the trust property after the income beneficiaries die.
 
✓ Carry out duties personally and not ask someone else to per-
form them, although a trustee is allowed to get professional 
advice and assistance.
 
✓ Not deal with the property for his or her own personal ben-
efit (for example, not sell herself property that’s in the trust 
unless the trust agreement or will specifically allows that).
A beneficiary can apply to the court to have a trustee removed if 
the trustee is not carrying out these responsibilities properly, or 
can sue a dishonest or incompetent trustee for losses the benefi-
ciary has suffered.
Examining the powers of a trustee
Trustees get their basic powers to act from a provincial statute 
(called the Trustees Act in all provinces other than Quebec, where 
trust matters are dealt with in the Civil Code) and can be given 
extra powers in the will or trust agreement.
 
Under the statutes, trustees can invest trust money in any kind of 
property in which a prudent investor might invest. A trustee will 
not be able to invest trust money in anything risky. If the settlor 
wants the trustee to rock a little, he can give the trustee broader 
investment powers in the trust agreement or will. The settlor can 
also give the trustee the power to decide how and when income 

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 105
from the trust is to be paid, and how and when the property of the 
trust is to be given to the beneficiaries. Then the trust is a discre-
tionary trust. For settlors who have very controlling personalities 
(. . . maybe you should see a therapist about that . . .) there is also 
the non-discretionary trust. The trust document sets out exactly 
how much income is to be paid and when, and what property is to 
be handed over and when, and the trustee has no power to stray 
from those instructions.
Choosing a trustee
If you thought it was hard to find a mate, try looking for a trustee. 
The perfect trustee
 
✓  Is honest.
 
✓ Has the skill and knowledge to handle the trust investments.
 
✓ Has completely trustworthy judgment if you’re allowing him 
or her discretion about the amount and timing of payment.
 
✓ Won’t favour one beneficiary over another if there is more 
than one beneficiary.
 
✓ Has the time necessary to devote to trustee duties, and will be 
alive long enough to complete the duties.
 
✓ Is willing to take on the job.
When you realize that you don’t know anyone who meets all of 
the qualifications to be a perfect trustee (and you don’t want to 
go with whoever is alive and willing in your circle of family and 
friends), you turn to a professional trustee.
A professional trustee — that is, a trust company — may be the 
answer if
 
✓ You have no family member or friend who resides in your 
province or has enough time to devote to the duties of a 
trustee.
 
✓ The trust property is so valuable or complicated to manage 
that you need real expertise.
 
✓ The trust will last for a long time, for example because the 
beneficiaries are young children.
 
✓ The relationship between the beneficiaries (or between the 
beneficiaries and the potential human trustee) is so screwed 
up that it may be difficult for a family member or friend who 
becomes a trustee not to have a favourite.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
106
You can name more than one person to act as a trustee. You 
might want to have a trust company as one trustee, and a friend 
or family member as another. (It may be a good idea to draft your 
will in such a way that your human trustees can hire a different 
trust company if they don’t like the rates or service of the first one 
chosen.)
If you name more than one trustee, they have to act unanimously 
unless the trust agreement or will says they don’t. (The trustees 
are allowed to bicker and whine without special permission.) If 
your trustees cannot get along, any of them can apply to the court 
to have one or more of the trustees removed. Setting up a trust is 
like creating your own soap opera!
 
If you name a human (as opposed to a trust company) as your 
trustee, be sure to name someone else as an alternate trustee in 
case your original trustee becomes unwilling or unable to carry 
out his or her duties before the trust ends. If you name only one 
trustee and that trustee dies, the executor of your trustee’s will 
becomes trustee of your trust. And you have no idea where your 
trustee’s executor might have been or what diseases he might 
have picked up along the way.
Paying a trustee
Trustees are entitled to be paid, and the amount they get paid is 
set by the provincial statute governing trustees. Depending on the 
province, a trustee is usually entitled to an annual management fee 
that’s a percentage (up to 6 percent) of the value of the trust prop-
erty, and to additional fees calculated as a percentage (usually 
between 5 and 6 percent) of the income the trust earns. A trustee 
is also usually allowed to charge an additional fee for preparing 
the trust’s annual income tax return. The actual amount of the 
trustee’s fees will depend on how complicated the trust is and how 
much work is involved.
What happens in practice is that the trustee makes up a bill show-
ing what she’s entitled to be paid and why and shows it to the ben-
eficiaries. If they don’t like what they see they can argue with the 
trustee, and if that doesn’t work they can ask a court to look the 
bill over and decide if the amount is fair.
Family members or friends who act as trustees often waive their 
fees. Professional trustees, on the other hand, have a minimum 
annual fee, of at least several thousand dollars. A trust company 
charges fees for its services over and above the compensation a 
trustee is entitled to claim under provincial trust legislation.

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 107
Paying the Taxes Associated 
with a Trust
Have you noticed that we manage to drag taxes into almost every 
single chapter, just to torture you? As if trusts weren’t torture 
enough even without tax implications! Well, grit your teeth and let’s 
get this over with. Taxes can raise their ugly heads at three points 
during the existence of a trust, which we discuss in this section.
Tax on the creation of the trust
You’ve probably already guessed by now . . . when you decide to 
create a trust, the thought has hardly entered your mind before 
you’ve got Canada Revenue breathing down your neck.
Tax on the settlor
If the trust is a testamentary trust, the transfer into the trust takes 
place on your death. As we tell you in Chapter 3, Canadian tax law 
says that when you die you “dispose” of all of your property imme-
diately before death and get its fair market value at the time. If the 
property has gone up in value since you acquired it, there’s a tax-
able capital gain. The estate pays the tax on any capital gain (only 
because Canada Revenue hasn’t yet found a way to follow taxpay-
ers into the afterlife — but they’re working on that).
If the trust is a living trust, tax law says that you dispose of the 
property to the trust for a price equal to its fair market value at the 
time. If the property has gone up in value since you acquired it, 
there’s a taxable capital gain. You pay the tax. It’s a drag, but look 
at it this way. It’s a small price to pay for still being alive.
Whether you’re setting up either a testamentary trust or a living 
trust, you can avoid the dread spectre of capital gains tax if the 
trust is for the benefit of your spouse, and your spouse is entitled 
to receive all of the income of the trust, and no one other than 
your spouse is entitled to receive or use income or capital of the 
trust as long as your spouse is alive. If you create the trust this 
way, it’s a spousal rollover (see Chapter 3) and neither you (if 
you’re alive when the trust comes into existence) nor your estate 
(if you’re dead) will have to pay capital gains tax. That’s because 
the trust steps into the shoes of the settlor and gets the property 
at the settlor’s original adjusted cost base — so there’s no capital 
gain to pay tax on.

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
108
Tax during the operation of the trust
Canada Revenue is only getting started when it dings the settlor or 
the estate for capital gains tax on creation of the trust. Next it set-
tles down to slurp up some income tax . . . from everyone in sight.
Tax on the settlor
 
If you create a living trust and give income-producing property to 
your spouse, Canada Revenue has the power to attribute to you 
both the income and capital gains the property earns in the future. 
The tax authorities can make you, the settlor, pay tax on the trust’s 
income or capital gains.
If you create a living trust for children or grandchildren under the 
age of 18, Canada Revenue has the power to attribute income but 
not capital gains to you. So the settlor, you, can be made to pay tax 
on the trust’s income.
Being taxed on attributed income is probably not enough to make 
you wish you were dead, but if you do happen to be dead there 
is no attribution of income or capital gains. The attribution rule 
doesn’t apply to a testamentary trust — if income tax is payable, it 
will have to be squeezed out of the trust or the beneficiaries.
Tax on the trust
A trust is a taxpayer, and it has to file an income tax return annu-
ally, declaring its income and capital gains. It can deduct certain 
expenses, including interest paid (if the estate borrowed money 
to invest in income-producing property such as shares, bonds, or 
rental property), investment management and accounting fees, and 
amounts paid to maintain trust property (for example, to re-roof 
a house held in the trust). However, unlike an individual (human) 
taxpayer, a trust cannot claim any personal tax credits except a 
credit for charitable deductions.
Testamentary trusts pay taxes at the same rate as individuals. (You 
can acquaint yourself with the tax-bracket system in Chapter 3.) But 
here we finally have some good news for you about taxes. A testa-
mentary trust is a good way to split income for tax purposes. The 
beneficiary of the trust and the trust will each file separate income 
tax returns, and each may pay income tax at a lower tax rate than 
if all of the income were reported in one tax return. This translates 
into a lower tax bill than if the income earned on the estate property 
were taxed directly in the hands of the beneficiary (where it would 
be taxed along with his or her income from other sources).

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 109
Unlike a testamentary trust, a living trust is taxed on its entire tax-
able income at the highest marginal tax rate, which is about 45 per-
cent, and so is not as useful for income-splitting purposes.
Tax on the beneficiaries
Income earned by the trust property doesn’t necessarily have to 
stick around in the trust to get taxed. If money received by the 
trust is paid out or payable to a beneficiary, the trustee can either 
declare that money as income in the trust’s annual tax return or 
can issue a T3 slip to the beneficiary.
If the trustee chooses the first route, the trust pays any tax that’s 
due. If the trustee chooses the second route, the beneficiary 
includes the money in his or her own return and pays any applica-
ble tax. This sounds like a good reason for the beneficiaries to stay 
on the right side of the trustee. The trustee normally decides who 
should pay the tax based on which choice results in the lowest 
combined tax bill for the trust and the beneficiary.
Tax when your trust 
comes of age at 21
Under Canadian tax laws, trusts are deemed to dispose of all of 
their capital property at fair market value 21 years after the cre-
ation of the trust, and then every 21 years after that. The purpose 
of this rule is to prevent taxpayers from (oh, horrors!) using trusts 
to put off paying capital gains tax indefinitely. If capital property 
in the trust has risen in value during the 21-year period since the 
trust was created, the trust has to pay tax on any capital gain.
Tax on the termination of the trust
When the trust ends and the trustee transfers the property to the 
capital beneficiary, no tax is payable by the settlor or the estate or 
the trustee or the beneficiaries. Everyone just walks out into the 
sunshine and goes tripping through the daisies.
Foolish reader! Don’t you know there is no escape?
Tax on the beneficiaries . . . later
On termination of the trust, the beneficiary takes over the property 
at the trust’s adjusted cost base. That means that from Canada 
Revenue’s point of view, the beneficiary acquired the property 
for whatever its cost when the trust acquired it, whether it came 

Part II: Estate Planning Tools  
110
directly from the settlor or was bought by the trust afterwards. 
When the beneficiary disposes of the property that came from the 
trust, the beneficiary is taxed on any increase in value of the prop-
erty from the time it came into the trust.
Paying the Expenses of a Trust
We won’t talk about taxes in this section . . . and you should be 
eternally grateful for that. But we do harp on the unpleasant sub-
ject of spending money. It will cost you to set up a trust, to main-
tain it, and to wind it up.
Set-up fees
The main expenses in setting up a trust are legal fees, although for 
variety there may be some accounting fees too. You’ll need advice 
on the tax implications of setting up your trust, and you’ll have to 
have the trust documents drafted (a trust agreement for a living 
trust, and a will for a testamentary trust). You (if this is a living 
trust) or your estate (if this is a testamentary trust) may have to 
pay additional legal fees to transfer the trust property into the 
name of the trustee. As a rule of thumb, it’s more expensive to set 
up a living trust than a testamentary trust.
Ongoing fees
A trust has continuing expenses, which are paid out of the prop-
erty in the trust. Not all of these expenses are applicable to every 
trust every year, of course, but here they are:
 
✓ Trustee’s fees
 
✓ Lawyer’s fees for legal advice
 
✓ Accountant’s fees for accounting or financial advice and for 
accounting to the beneficiaries
 
✓ Broker’s commissions on investments
 
✓ Safety deposit box rental
Winding-up fees
A trustee is entitled to be paid a fee for transferring the property 
of the trust to the capital beneficiaries when the trust comes to an 
end. This fee is calculated as a percentage (usually between 1 and 
2.5 percent) of the value of the trust property.

 Chapter 6: Pass the Buck: Using Trusts in Estate Planning 111
There may be lawyer’s fees for transferring ownership of the trust 
property (such as a house, vehicle, or corporate shares, but not 
usually cash) to the beneficiaries.
There is no charge to you for winding up this chapter. If you 
enjoyed it as much as we did, feel free to read it again. No charge 
for a second reading either.

his part starts you off — at last! — on the process of 
planning your own estate. We help you choose people 
to give your property away to (your benefi ciaries) and a 
person to manage your estate after your death until all the 
property has been given away (your executor). We tell 
you how to make arrangements to look after your young 
children after your death, how to pass on your business, 
and how to express your charitable feelings. We fi nish this

C
aptain on the bridge! That’s you, the captain of your ship of 
estate.
In the preceding chapters we tell you about the reasons for estate 
planning, income tax concerns, and the main estate planning tools. 
Now it’s time to start using what you’ve learned and begin to create 
an estate plan.
The first step will be to assemble a crew for your estate — your 
beneficiaries (the people you will provide for in your estate plan) 
and your executor (the person who will manage your estate after 
you’ve sailed into the sunset).
Considering Your Beneficiaries
When you die, you have to give away everything you own. That 
means figuring out whom to give it to. This is the fun part of estate 
planning — you can reward those who’ve been good to you and 
punish those who haven’t by giving a gift here, withholding a gift 
there. Not everyone can afford the fantasy of planning their estate 
just to get even with their family, friends, and acquaintances. Most 
people have obligations, and those obligations may extend past 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
116
the end of life. Sometimes feelings and obligations match exactly — 
then Bingo! you choose a beneficiary without any trouble at all. 
But in other cases the feelings and obligations are completely at 
odds (feelings: good, obligation: none; or feelings: bad, obligation: 
heavy) and it becomes more difficult to make choices. In this sec-
tion we help you think about how to choose your beneficiaries.
The people you want to provide for
Unless you have the misfortune to come from a 100 percent dys-
functional family, it won’t be difficult to settle on the people you 
actually want to give your money and belongings to.
Rounding up the usual suspects
Take a look around you to see the beneficiaries whom you’ll want 
to provide for. They’re the people you live with or spend your time 
with. As we mention in Chapter 1, who these people are may vary 
with your stage of life:
 
✓ When you’re young and single, they’re parents, brothers and 
sisters, friends, a charity, or a combination of these.
 
✓ When you marry or settle into a serious relationship, it will 
probably be your spouse or partner whom you want to get all 
or most of what you own.
 
✓ When you have young children, they’ll likely be first in your 
mind.
 
✓ If you divorce, your children or other relatives will be at the 
top of the list and your former spouse may be right off it.
 
✓ Once your children are grown up and self-sufficient, grand-
children or a favourite charity may attract your attention.
What’s your reason for giving?
You may have many different reasons to include certain family 
members or friends in your estate plan. The particular reason you 
have in each case will affect what you decide to give and how you 
go about giving it.
You may want to include someone in your estate plan in order to
 
✓ Provide ongoing support. Your spouse or children, or some 
other relative or friend, may need your financial assistance. It 
may take the bulk of your estate to do it.
 
✓ Help meet a particular goal. Finishing a university degree, 
starting a business, or buying a house requires cash. A gift of 
a specific amount of money will do the trick.

 Chapter 7: Beneficiaries and Executor 117
 
✓ Say thank you. An employee may have been very loyal, or a 
friend may have been especially kind when you were sick or in 
some kind of trouble. A gift of money or one of your personal 
possessions may be the answer.
 
✓ Pass on a family heirloom. You may have received furniture, 
photographs, or papers from your parents or grandparents 
that have been in the family for generations or that have spe-
cial significance for your family. You’d like the heirloom to go 
to a relative who will value it and pass it on in turn.
 
✓ Leave a memento. A family member may have admired a piece 
of your jewellery or a friend may have shared your passion for 
collecting china figurines. A gift of a particular item would be 
appropriate.
 
✓ Show that he or she was in your thoughts. A gift of one of 
your personal possessions or a small sum of money will be 
appreciated.
What’s the right tool for making the gift?
The most obvious way to give to your survivors is to leave money 
or property in your will. But, as we say in Chapter 1, there are 
other ways of providing:
 
✓ Life insurance: You can name someone as beneficiary of a life 
insurance policy and your beneficiary will receive the insur-
ance proceeds directly (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ RRSPs and RRIFs: You can name someone as beneficiary of 
your RRSP or RRIF and your beneficiary will receive the RRSP/
RRIF proceeds directly (see Chapter 3).
 
✓ Pension plans: If you are a member of an employee pension 
plan, you may be able to name a beneficiary to receive a pen-
sion after your death or a one-time payment (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ Joint ownership of property: If you own property jointly with 
another person, when you die your share in the property 
will automatically pass to the surviving owner, without your 
having to mention the property in your will.
That’s the how. Now what about the when? When do you want 
the person to get the money or property? Timing will also affect 
your choice of estate planning tool. You may want to provide for 
someone
 
✓ While you’re alive: That means a gift (see Chapter 5) or a 
living trust (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Immediately after your death: That means making a gift in 
your will (see Chapters 12 and 13) or naming the person as 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
118
a beneficiary of your life insurance policy (see Chapter 4) or 
your RRSP or RRIF (see Chapter 3).
 
✓ After you die but not until someone else also dies: You may 
want your children to inherit your property for example, but 
not until after the death of your spouse. That means setting 
up a trust in your will (see Chapter 6) to give your spouse the 
use of the property during his or her lifetime, and to hand the 
property over to your children when your spouse dies.
 
✓ After you die but not until the person reaches a certain age: 
You may not want your children to have total control over the 
inherited property until they are 25 years old, for example. 
That means setting up a trust in your will to keep your money 
invested for your children until they turn 25, and then to give 
them the property outright.
Should you give to children directly or indirectly?
If you have children under the age of majority to deal with, you’ll 
have some special concerns. You must decide whether to provide 
for them by making a gift to the children themselves or, if they’re 
not your children, by making a gift to their parents (and benefiting 
the children by a trickle-down effect).
If you are married with young children, you certainly want to 
make sure that your children are supported after you die, but that 
doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to give money to them 
directly by naming them as beneficiaries of your will and/or insur-
ance policies. You can achieve your purpose by leaving your estate 
to your spouse, who will use it to support your children.
If you’re dubious about what your spouse will do with the money, 
then you must name your children as beneficiaries to make sure 
that they’re provided for. But if you want to leave money for your 
children, you must set up a trust in your will that will invest the 
money for the children, pay out income and capital as necessary, 
and turn the entire fund over to the children when they grow up. 
(See Chapters 6 and 8 for more about children and trusts.)
 
If you give a large sum of money directly to a minor child (under 
age 18 or 19, depending on the province), the provincial govern-
ment will step in and put the money into a trust. The trust will be 
managed by a government official (called the public trustee in most 
provinces) and turned over to the child when he or she comes of 
age. Many people aren’t all that keen on the way the provincial 
government manages their tax dollars and would be less than 
thrilled to have the government managing their personal money.

 Chapter 7: Beneficiaries and Executor 119
If you have grandchildren, nephews and nieces, or other children 
whose lot in life you’d like to improve, the question still arises — 
do you want them to benefit directly or indirectly? If you want the 
child to have a direct benefit, you can make a gift to be held in 
trust until the child comes of age. If you have education in mind, 
you can even set up a Registered Education Savings Plan to help 
out the child with university or college expenses (see Chapter 5). 
If you think it would be better to benefit someone else’s child indi-
rectly, you can give a gift to the child’s parents and make the entire 
family’s finances healthier.
The people you have to provide for
You may see some people in your life more as ballast than crew. 
They’re the people you have to provide for even though you may 
not want to — they have to be in your estate plan too.
 
You may think that you can do what you like with your property 
when you make your will, but you’re wrong. For centuries, people 
making wills could do pretty much what they wanted — they had 
the right of testamentary freedom.
However, since the early years of the 20th century certain limits 
have been placed on that freedom. Nowadays when you’re making 
plans, you have to take into account the possibility that, when 
you’ve passed on, claims will be made against your estate by
 
✓ People who are dependent on you for support
 
✓ Your spouse
 
✓ People you’ve promised to provide for
People who are dependent on you for support
Have you been giving money to certain family members or old pals 
for years and think it’s high time they stood on their own two feet? 
So far you’ve never been able to work up the nerve to tell them 
you’re turning off the tap, but you’re looking forward to doing just 
that in your will. Well, we have some bad news for you — death 
is no certain escape from those relatives and friends who have 
attached themselves to you like barnacles.
 
Every province has a law to make sure that your dependants — 
certain people you are required by law to support — will be looked 
after out of your estate.
The definition of a dependant varies from province to province. In 
some provinces only children or legally married spouses can be 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
120
considered dependants. In other provinces unmarried spouses, 
parents, grandparents, or siblings can also qualify as dependants.
A person won’t necessarily be considered a dependant just 
because he or she is related to you. The person must also be 
someone whom you were supporting (or under a legal obligation 
to support) at the time of your death. Likewise, a person won’t be 
considered a dependant just because you were supporting him or 
her before you died. There must also be a recognized relationship 
between the two of you.
For example, your deadbeat friend who has been sleeping on your 
basement sofa and whose car loan you have been paying for the 
last six months would not qualify as a dependant. But your own 
child under the age of majority would qualify as a dependant 
whether or not you are providing support for him or her.
Provincial law allows a dependant to make a claim for support 
from your estate if you do not leave him or her enough money in 
your will. A judge would decide whether to provide for a depen-
dant out of your estate by looking at things such as that person’s 
other sources of income and ability to earn a living.
Dependants are given a fixed period of time, usually six months, 
in which to make a claim by starting a court action. Your executor 
cannot legally start giving your estate away to your chosen benefi-
ciaries until the time limit for these claims has passed and no claim 
has been made.
Once someone has made a claim, your executor will not be allowed 
to give anything to your beneficiaries without first getting a court 
order, or else getting the consent in writing of everyone who has 
the right to make a claim against your estate as a dependant. If 
your executor does give any of your estate to your beneficiaries 
without consent or a court order, the executor could really land in 
the drink. He or she may personally have to pay the dependant if 
the estate doesn’t have enough money left.
 
If you have been supporting someone, or know or think that you 
have a legal obligation to support someone, tell your lawyer when 
you’re making your will. Your lawyer can determine whether or 
not that person has the right to make a claim against your estate 
as a dependant. If the person does have a right, you should prob-
ably leave enough money in your will to support him or her. (Your 
lawyer will be able to help you figure out how much that is.)

 Chapter 7: Beneficiaries and Executor 121
 
There’s not much to be gained by trying to leave a dependant out 
of your will. A dependant with any gumption will get the money out 
of your estate anyway — and your other beneficiaries won’t get 
anything until the claim has been dealt with.
Your spouse
In addition to being able to make a claim against you as a depen-
dant, in some provinces your spouse may have the right to claim a 
minimum share of your estate. Some provinces have passed family 
law legislation that is designed to give a surviving spouse the same 
rights to a division of property that a spouse would have on a 
marriage breakdown. So if you’re thinking that death would be a 
cheaper escape from your marriage than divorce, think again.
Your spouse gets to choose whether to claim under the provincial 
family law or under the will. If your spouse elects to claim under 
the family law, he or she has a fixed period of time, usually six 
months, in which to make a claim by starting a court action. Your 
executor can’t legally give any of your estate to your chosen ben-
eficiaries until the time limit has passed without a claim, unless 
your spouse consents. If your spouse does make a claim, your 
executor won’t be allowed to give anything to your beneficiaries 
until his or her claim is settled, without your spouse’s consent or 
a court order. If your executor does give any of your estate to your 
beneficiaries without consent, the executor may personally have to 
pay some or all of any amount a court later awards to your spouse.
It looks like “’til death do us part” is a bit off the mark, doesn’t 
it? Even if you’re looking forward to death as a way of fleeing the 
clutches and financial demands of your spouse, if you live in a 
province that gives spouses a right to a share of an estate you have 
to leave your spouse the required amount.
 
When you talk to your lawyer about making your will, your lawyer 
will ask if you are married or separated. He or she will tell you 
whether or not your spouse has the right to make a claim for a 
share in your estate. If your spouse does have a right, you’ll prob-
ably have to leave him or her enough money to satisfy it. (Again, 
your lawyer will be able to help you figure out how much that is.) 
As with your dependent relatives, there’s little to be gained by 
trying to leave your spouse out of your will.
People you’ve promised to provide for
Generally speaking, if you promise a person that you’ll make a 
provision in your estate, he or she can’t force your estate to carry 
through on your promise. That only goes for ordinary, run-of-the-
mill promises, though. If your promise is contained in a contract, 
the person to whom you made the promise may be able to make a 
claim against your estate.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
122
This kind of promise is most commonly found in separation agree-
ments. A separation agreement may contain a promise by one of 
the spouses that
 
✓ His or her estate will continue to make support payments to 
a spouse and/or children. If you have made this kind of prom-
ise, you should make sure that you earmarked enough money 
in your estate for support payments. (Your lawyer will prob-
ably suggest that in your will you give your executor the right 
to try to negotiate a one-time payment to replace ongoing 
payments.)
 
✓ He or she will maintain a life insurance policy in a specific 
amount naming the spouse and/or children as beneficiaries, 
failing which the estate will be required to pay a fixed amount 
of money to the spouse and/or children. If you have made this 
kind of promise, you should make sure that you’ve got that 
life insurance in place!
 
If you have signed a separation agreement, show it to your lawyer 
when you go to talk about preparing your will.
The people you decided 
not to provide for
Finally, you may have people in your life who’ve walked the 
plank — these are the people you don’t want to give anything to, 
don’t legally have to give anything to, and don’t intend to give any-
thing to. In your estate plan you should pay attention to them as well.
What if you don’t want to leave anything to someone who is a close 
relative? You’ve got your reasons. Perhaps you’ve already given 
a gift of money or property, or you believe that he or she doesn’t 
need your money and property but other relatives do. Maybe you 
once made a substantial loan that was never repaid. Or maybe you 
just can’t stand this person and the two of you have been quarrel-
ling for years.
A close relative who feels entitled to be included in your will may 
be tempted to go to court to try to have your will set aside after 
your death. If your will does get set aside, then you have no valid 
will — and provincial rules about who shares in your estate if you 
die without a valid will (that is, if you die intestate) take effect (see 
Chapter 12). Depending on how close this relative is and what 
other relatives survive you, he or she might manage to get a chunk 
of your property. Learn from “Captain Adams’ mistake.”

 Chapter 7: Beneficiaries and Executor 123
 
It may be a wise idea to give an explanation in your will if you are 
leaving a close relative little or nothing. If you don’t say anything 
at all about this person, the troublemaker could argue to the court 
that failing to remember him or her at all was evidence that your 
mind was in tatters when you made your will. If you mention the 
person and give a reason for cutting him or her out, it will make an 
attack from that quarter more difficult.
Distributing Your Estate Amongst 
Your Beneficiaries
Write down the names of the people you want to provide for, the 
people you legally have to provide for, and the people you can safely 
cut out of your will. Next to each name, note roughly how much that 
person needs from you or can extract from you under provincial 
law. If you’re leaving out a close relative, briefly explain why.
Then, perhaps with your inventory from Chapter 2 in hand, sug-
gest where the required amount for each person is going to come 
from: your property (be specific if you can, for example, “cottage,” 
“mutual funds,” or “RRSP”), an insurance policy, or pension ben-
efits. You can also think about whether your gift should be given 
while you’re alive or in your will.
Captain Adams’ mistake
Captain Adams, a widower, had two sons, Krill and Strannix. Because of their abu-
sive behaviour toward him (maybe they would have turned out better if he hadn’t 
given them such weird names), he had little to do with them after they grew up. 
He decided that he would make the beneficiaries of his estate his cook and his 
housekeeper, Casey and Jordan. He said nothing about his sons in his will, and 
after his death they challenged the will on the ground that he was not of sound 
mind when he made it. They pointed to the fact that he left nothing to his only rela-
tives, and instead gave it all to two unrelated people who were living with him and 
had had an opportunity to influence his decision for their own benefit. The court 
agreed and set aside the will. In Captain Adams’ province, if a person dies intestate 
and has children but no legally married spouse, the entire estate is divided equally 
among the children. So Krill and Strannix got all of their father’s estate. To show 
there were no hard feelings, Casey offered them a cruise with dinner, and they 
graciously accepted.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
124
 
Take this list with you when you meet your lawyer to talk about 
preparing your will. Your lawyer will help you fine tune your 
instructions to take into account the nasty tricks that debts and 
taxes can play on your choices.
Thinking about Your Executor
You get to be captain on your ship of estate, but you need some-
one to carry out your orders when you’re down in Davy Jones’s 
locker. That’s what your executor is for.
Looking at what an executor does
Before you can decide whom to name as your executor, you should 
know what it is your executor will have to do. Not everyone is cut 
out to be an executor, so you’ll want to choose yours carefully.
Your executor (called a liquidator in Quebec and an estate trustee 
with a will in Ontario) must
 
✓ Make your funeral arrangements. An executor usually checks 
to see if you left any instructions and consults with the family 
about what you may have liked, but the executor has the legal 
responsibility to make your funeral arrangements and has the 
final say about them. (For more about funeral arrangements, 
see Chapter 11.)
 
✓ Collect information about your estate. Your executor has to 
get a reasonable amount of information about the property 
you own and your debts (including the approximate value 
of both) in order to apply for letters probate, and locate and 
gather in your property.
 
✓ Protect the property of your estate. Your executor has to 
make sure that valuables (house, car, jewellery, artwork, and 
so on) are kept safe, and that the property of the estate is 
properly insured. If you leave behind a business or invest-
ments that need active attention, your executor has to look 
after them personally or else hire a skillful person to manage 
them.
 
✓ Apply, if necessary, for letters probate (known in Ontario as 
a certificate of appointment of estate trustee with a will). In 
order to administer your estate, your executor must be able 
to prove to the world that he or she has the legal authority 
to do so. The best proof is letters probate, a document from 
the provincial surrogate or probate court certifying that your 
will is valid. (Your executor may or may not have to apply 

 Chapter 7: Beneficiaries and Executor 125
for letters probate depending on the size and complexity of 
your estate.) In order to get letters probate, your executor will 
have to estimate the value of your estate and have the estate 
pay probate fees (in almost all provinces, probate fees are 
based on the total value of your estate).
 
✓ Gather in the property belonging to your estate. Your execu-
tor will have to track down everything that you owned and 
that now belongs to the estate, and, if necessary, transfer the 
registration of things that were in your name into the estate’s 
name (real estate, vehicles, bank accounts, investments). 
Property that your executor must track down includes insur-
ance proceeds, pension benefits, and survivors’ benefits that 
are owed to your family.
 
✓ Make an inventory of the property in your estate and value 
the property. Your executor has to have a reasonably good 
idea of the value of your estate in order to get letters probate. 
But in order to complete your terminal tax return, your execu-
tor will have to know your exact income in the year you died 
as well as the exact present value of your capital property and 
its value when you got it (for capital gains tax calculations). 
See Chapter 3 for more on capital gains taxes.
 
✓ Keep the money and investments in your estate properly 
invested. Your executor has to stash your cash in a safe place 
until he or she pays the estate’s debts and taxes and distrib-
utes the remainder of the estate to the beneficiaries. An exec-
utor has to choose conservative, low-risk investments unless 
you give special instructions in your will (for example, that 
playing the futures market or day trading is okay). Your ben-
eficiaries can sue your executor for making bad investments 
and reducing the value of the estate before it’s given to them.
 
✓ Pay debts and taxes. Your executor must find out whom you 
owed money to (your creditors) and then pay them, and must 
also file your terminal income tax return and any outstanding 
past returns (and, as time passes, estate tax returns) and pay 
income taxes due. All payments come out of the estate, not 
the executor’s pocket.
 
✓ Distribute your estate to the beneficiaries. Your executor has 
to hand over the property in your estate to your beneficia-
ries, following the instructions in your will. If your will cre-
ates a trust naming your executor the trustee, he or she will 
continue to hold onto the trust property and manage it on 
behalf of the beneficiaries of the trust, in accordance with the 
instructions in the will.
 
✓ Account to the beneficiaries. Your executor will have to give 
a statement to the beneficiaries that sets out what money and 
property were received and paid out on behalf of your estate.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
126
Examining an executor’s 
legal responsibilities
Your executor is a kind of trustee (we talk about trustees in 
Chapter 6) who must
 
✓ Follow the instructions set out in your will.
 
✓ Obey provincial laws about trusts.
 
✓ Act with the greatest trust, loyalty, and honesty.
 
✓ Deal with the property of the estate the same way a reason-
ably prudent businessperson would handle his or her own 
property.
 
✓ Act in the best interests of the beneficiaries and not favour 
some beneficiaries over others.
 
✓ Carry out duties personally and not pass them off to someone 
else (although it’s okay for the executor to have profession-
als working for him or her, such as having a lawyer get letters 
probate or an accountant prepare tax returns or a broker give 
investment advice).
 
✓ Not try to make a personal profit from the estate or get a good 
deal for himself or herself on property from the estate.
Choosing your executor
So far what you know about an executor is this: An executor has to 
perform fairly complex tasks like arranging your funeral and look-
ing after and valuing real estate, investments, and personal posses-
sions; has to manage the finances of your estate; has to deal with a 
lawyer or a court office to get letters probate; has to keep track of 
everything that comes into and goes out of your estate; and has to 
make sure your beneficiaries get what you want them to get. And an 
executor has to do all these things with honesty and loyalty, and do 
them as well as a reasonably careful businessperson would do them 
when dealing with his or her own property. (Read Chapter 13 to find 
out what can go wrong if you choose the wrong executor.)
 
Clearly, acting as an executor isn’t going to be as easy as falling out 
of a crow’s nest. That means you don’t want to choose someone 
who’s going to have trouble fulfilling the role because his or her 
business or management skills are too limited to deal with the kind 
of property you’re leaving. You also don’t want to choose someone 
who won’t want the job (a person named as executor doesn’t have 
to accept) or who doesn’t have time to do it. Likewise, you’d prefer 

 Chapter 7: Beneficiaries and Executor 127
to avoid someone who’s not likely to last as long as your estate — if 
you set up a trust for young children, for example, you don’t want 
to name an executor who has one foot in the grave. Last but not 
least, you don’t want an executor who’s going to have trouble get-
ting along with one or more of the beneficiaries, or who may find it 
hard to treat certain beneficiaries fairly.
Have a look at your potential crew members. Does anyone there 
fill the bill? There’s no need to panic just because your family and 
friends are normal human beings instead of lawyers, accountants, 
bankers, or entrepreneurs. Most executors do not administer the 
estate all on their own. They hire a lawyer and perhaps an accoun-
tant to carry out many of these tasks. So if your estate is relatively 
simple, anyone who is honest and has good common sense and at 
least enough sophistication to work with a lawyer and/or accoun-
tant can be your executor.
If you think it will take more than one person to handle the chal-
lenge, you can name two or more individuals as co-executors. If 
your estate is complex, you can name a trust company (their ser-
vices may be expensive) as your executor, or as a co-executor with 
an individual. If you decide to go for co-executors, though, keep 
in mind that they have to act unanimously unless you say in your 
will that they don’t. Then think about which would be worse — 
requiring your executors to agree about everything, or letting 
each one act alone?
 
Oh, and by the way, you should think about naming an alternate 
executor, especially if you’ve chosen to go with a single executor. If 
you don’t name an alternate executor and the executor who’s your 
only choice dies before you or refuses to act, someone will have 
to come forward and apply to the court to be made the admin-
istrator of your estate. If your executor dies after you and you 
haven’t named an alternate executor, your executor’s executor will 
become your executor.
Suppose you feel that you have to name some particular person as 
your executor in order to avoid hurting his or her feelings deeply, 
even though he or she isn’t quite up to the job. Your spouse, for 
example, may be very offended at being rejected for the post.
You can take steps while you’re alive or in your will to help the 
landlubber executor — throw a lifeline, as it were. For example, 
you can pair this executor with a more skilled and experienced 
executor by naming a more business-savvy friend or relative as 
co-executor. If your estate is complicated and has enough money 
to pay the extra fees involved, you can name a trust company, or 
a professional like your lawyer or accountant, as co-executor. Or 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
128
you could start introducing your executor to your affairs gradu-
ally while you’re alive and well (and hope you don’t kick off before 
the executor gets the hang of them). You could also put together a 
team of professional advisers (lawyer, financial consultant, accoun-
tant, broker) and let your executor know they’ll be available to 
help when the time comes.
After you’ve decided on an executor, speak to the person you’ve 
chosen and ask if he or she would agree to be your executor. If 
the person says, “I don’t know anything about being an executor,” 
hand over this chapter to read and then ask again. If the person of 
your choice says no, move on to someone else.

Chapter 8
Who’s Minding the Kids? 
Planning Your Children’s 
Future
In This Chapter
▶ Looking into the rules of guardianship
▶ Considering what you want to happen to your children if both parents die
▶ Investigating how to choose a guardian for your children
▶  Understanding a guardian’s duties
▶ Looking at how to provide for your children financially after you die
A
s frightening as it is to contemplate your children as orphans, 
you must think about what will happen to your children 
under the age of majority if you die before them — and what you 
can do to try to make sure they’ll be safe and well cared for even 
though you’re not there.
Understanding Guardianship
Before we get into what will happen to the kids when you die, 
we’re going to tell you what the law says about who cares for the 
kids when their parents are still alive. This will delay the stuff 
about orphans, which you really don’t want to hear about, and 
make it easier to understand when we get there.
In every province, both living parents are the guardians of their 
children. That means that they’re both responsible for caring for 
the children and they both have the right to make decisions about 
how the children are raised — where they should live, what reli-
gion they should be raised in, where they should go to school, and 
what medical treatment they should have.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
130
This two-parents, two-guardians arrangement is hunky-dory if both 
parents live together. Things get a little less hunky-dory and a little 
more complicated if the parents are separated or divorced. Then 
they will have to agree who will have custody of the children.
Custody and guardianship mean pretty much the same thing. The 
person who has custody of the children is the person with whom 
the children live and who cares for the children and makes the 
decisions that affect their lives. The parents may agree that they 
will continue to share custody in some way — such as joint cus-
tody, which allows both parents to have a say in how the children 
are raised — or they may agree that only one of them will have 
custody.
If separated parents can’t come to an agreement about custody, 
the courts will decide for them. Judges often prefer joint custody 
arrangements. If that’s impossible because the parents won’t coop-
erate, judges make their decisions by assuming that both parents 
have an equal right to care for their children but that custody 
should go to the one who can care for them best.
Thinking the Unthinkable: When 
One or Both Parents Die
What happens to the children on the death of the first parent 
depends on the custody arrangements that existed beforehand.
If one parent dies but the other 
is still alive and has custody
If one parent dies and the parents were sharing custody — 
either because they were living together as a family, or because, 
although separated or divorced, they had agreed to a joint cus-
tody arrangement, or because a court had ordered a joint custody 
arrangement — the surviving parent simply carries on as sole 
guardian of the children.
If one parent dies and that 
parent had sole custody
If the parent who died had sole custody of the children, a number 
of things could happen:

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Children’s Future 131
 
✓ Someone, perhaps the surviving parent, the new spouse of 
the parent who died, or a grandparent will come forward and 
offer to look after the children.
 
✓  More than one person — surviving parent, new spouse, 
grandparents, and maybe other relatives — will put in dibs on 
the kids and they’ll wage a long, drawn-out, expensive fight 
over who gets to care for them. If the kids are this lovable, 
they may have a future in the entertainment business.
 
✓ No one will offer to take the children. The surviving parent 
may not want them and there may be no other close relatives 
or friends who feel a moral obligation towards them — or 
else everyone who may feel a moral obligation is already 
acquainted with the children. Having enjoyed the spectacle 
of them tearing around like banshees when they were not 
murdering each other over the TV, the toys, or the right 
to monopolize the bathroom, all potential caregivers run 
screaming in the opposite direction. Sadly, this may also be 
the case if a child has a disability and needs extra care.
If only one person wants custody
Only one person may be interested in caring for the children. Or 
the entire family may have discussed the situation and agreed that 
a particular family member should care for the children.
The person who wants custody or guardianship of the children 
will have to apply to the court for a formal custody order. In a few 
provinces, a surviving parent who was not a guardian (because of 
an agreement or court order giving custody to the other parent 
alone) automatically becomes the guardian and doesn’t legally 
need a court order. But even when no legal requirement to get a 
court order exists, a formal order may be necessary to allow the 
guardian to
 
✓ Receive any money for the children’s care and upbringing that 
was left by the parent who died.
 
✓ Register the children in school.
 
✓ Consent to medical treatment on behalf of the children.
When an application for custody is made, the court has a duty to 
make sure that the person applying is capable of looking after the 
children and has a reasonable plan for their upbringing. This is 
true even if no one comes forward to oppose the application.
If there’s a custody battle
If the kids are popular and a fight erupts over who gets them, the 
court decides who gets custody. The judge hearing the application 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
132
will base his or her decision on the best interests of the child. This 
means that the judge will want to hear about such things as
 
✓ The family relationship between the children and each person 
claiming custody.
 
✓ The emotional ties between the children and each person 
claiming custody.
 
✓ The existing living arrangements between the children and 
any person claiming custody.
 
✓ The ability of each person claiming custody to look after the 
children.
 
✓ The plans of each person claiming custody for the care and 
upbringing of the children.
 
✓ The stability of the family life of each person claiming custody 
of the children.
 
✓ The children’s point of view. In some provinces, the children 
are entitled to a lawyer to put their interests forward.
How these factors would play out in an actual custody battle would 
depend on the particular circumstances of the case. Read “Joanna 
vs. Shelby” for an example. Once you’ve read it, you may see some 
patterns.
A biological parent has a real advantage, even if he or she was not 
the greatest parent before the other parent’s death. Unless the 
surviving biological parent is seriously unfit to look after a child, 
the courts will likely grant him or her custody. The only competi-
tion to watch out for is a relative or friend with whom the children 
lived before the death of the first parent. And the preferences of an 
older child are very important.
Joanna vs. Shelby
Ted and Joanna were married and had an adorable little boy named Billy. Ted 
worked long hours at the office while Joanna stayed at home painting clouds on 
the ceilings and feeling unfulfilled. When Ted came home and announced that he’d 
received a wonderful promotion that would require him to work even longer hours 
at the office, Joanna packed up her paintbrushes and left. After a vicious custody 
fight in which Ted and Joanna each went to some trouble to prove that the other 
was a completely unfit parent, Ted got custody of Billy. Later, after the divorce 
decree came through, Ted married his secretary, Shelby. Several years passed, 
during which Ted and Shelby had two children of their own. Then Ted accidentally 
got run over in the driveway of Billy’s school by a van driven by someone who didn’t 
know about the one-way rule.

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Children’s Future 133
If no one wants the kids
If there are no family members or friends who are willing and able 
to look after the children, the children will be considered children 
in need of protection under the province’s child welfare legislation.
We don’t do orphanages in Canada any more, so put out of your 
mind the sad picture of your children trudging up the steps of 
some grey and soulless institution. But don’t worry, we’ve got 
other sad pictures to replace it. The children will be placed in the 
care of a child and family services agency, which will try to find 
them a foster home (they make an effort to keep families together 
in one foster home but it’s not always possible). The children may 
be adopted, especially if they’re quite young, perhaps by the foster 
parents or perhaps by someone else.
Child and family services agencies are fairly careful about picking 
foster parents, and they keep an eye on the children in foster care. 
Joanna and Shelby both want custody of Billy. Competitors, on your marks, get 
set, go!
Joanna starts out ahead because she’s Billy’s biological mother. She starts out 
even further ahead because of her close relationship with Billy — he stays over-
night at her place regularly, in a room with clouds painted on the ceiling.
But Shelby isn’t far behind Joanna because Billy has lived with her for several 
years. The gap closes because she too has a close relationship with Billy, and it 
narrows even further because she and Ted had children. Giving custody of Billy 
to Joanna would mean separating him from his little half-brother and half-sister.
The competition heats up as we look at how well Joanna and Shelby are equipped 
to look after the kids. Shelby loses points for having poor income prospects as 
a secretary, while Joanna gains points for being a well-paid graphic artist. But 
Joanna will be docked points for her busy travel schedule.
Shelby can move up on the inside with her plans for where Billy will live. If she can 
afford to go on living in their current home, Billy won’t have to change schools or 
lose his friends. She’ll fall back if she’s going to have to move from the neighbour-
hood to somewhere north of the treeline just to make ends meet.
Joanna lengthens her stride and gets ahead since she’s currently in a stable rela-
tionship and Billy gets along well with her partner. But she falters because she’s 
gone through several marriages or live-in relationships since leaving Ted.
Finally, Billy has a chance to influence the outcome of the competition. He’s nearly 
a teenager now, and he may have a preference about where he’d like to live. He’s 
old enough to vote with his feet, and it will be hard for his mother, his stepmother, 
or a court to force him to stay anywhere he doesn’t want to stay. In the long run, 
Billy’s preferences may settle the matter entirely.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
134
The adoption process is quite lengthy and is geared toward inves-
tigating the adoptive parents to make sure they’re fit. But there’s 
no doubt about it, even a kind foster family or adoptive family isn’t 
the same thing as your family.
Children who are not adopted are on their own as soon as they 
come of age (18 or 19 depending on the province). If they inher-
ited property from the parent who died and that parent made no 
special trust provisions, the children will also receive the property 
as soon as they come of age. So your teenagers could be running 
around with no one to supervise them and their pockets full of 
cash . . . or with nothing in their pockets at all.
If both parents are dead
If the children have only one surviving parent who then dies, or 
if both parents die at the same time, the result will be the same. 
There is no person who has an automatic right to take over cus-
tody of the children.
Earlier in the chapter we tell you what may happen when we talked 
about the death of a parent who has sole custody of the children. 
But we’ll go over it again just to grind the point in. If both of the 
children’s parents are dead,
 
✓ One person may offer to look after the children. It will be up to 
the courts to decide whether that person is suitable — and if he 
or she is not, then the children will be turned over to the child 
and family services agency as a child in need of protection.
 
✓ Several people may offer to look after the children and a 
custody battle over them may occur — but in this case no 
one has the advantage of being the children’s parent, so the 
outcome of the fight may be harder to predict. With luck, at 
least one of the people who want custody will be someone the 
court thinks is fit to have custody.
 
✓ No one may offer to look after the children. Then, as we 
describe earlier, the children will be handed over to the child 
and family services agency.
Choosing a Guardian 
for Your Children
Suppose that your children’s other parent has already left the 
scene, or that your supply of children-loving relatives and friends 

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Children’s Future 135
is scanty. Is there anything you can do to make sure that the kids 
will land with the guardian of your choice?
We have to tell you up front that there isn’t anything you can do 
to guarantee absolutely that a person you choose to look after 
your children will end up looking after your children. But there are 
some things you can do that will improve the chances that your 
choice will be respected:
 
✓ You can name in your will the person you want to look after 
your children when you die.
 
✓ You can take steps to ensure that the person you’ve chosen 
has such a solid relationship with your children that the 
courts will uphold your choice even if it is attacked by some-
one else.
Testamentary guardian
 
A testamentary guardian is a person a parent appoints in his or her 
will to look after the children. In almost every province, a parent 
can appoint a testamentary guardian — but making the appoint-
ment won’t necessarily dissolve all parental worries. The effect of 
appointing a guardian depends on the province the family lives in 
and whether or not there is a surviving parent.
If the other parent survives the testator
If the parents shared custody of the children and only one parent 
dies, the surviving parent will continue to be the guardian of the 
children. It doesn’t matter that the parent who died named a dif-
ferent guardian by will — the deceased parent can’t terminate the 
surviving parent’s right to be guardian of the children. In some 
provinces, the appointment of the guardian has no effect at all in 
these circumstances, and in most other provinces the surviving 
parent can go to court to remove the guardian named by will. In a 
couple of provinces the guardian named by will can act as guard-
ian, but has to act jointly with the surviving parent.
If the parent who died had sole custody of the children and the 
other parent survives, the surviving parent does not automatically 
become the guardian. But neither does the guardian appointed by 
will. Anyone who wants custody of the children will have to go to 
court to get it, and if more than one person is asking for custody, 
they’ll have to duke it out in front of a judge.
The surviving parent has the better chance of getting custody 
unless he or she is really an unfit parent. If the parent is unfit, 
then the guardian appointed by will may get the nod, so too if 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
136
the children have been living safely and happily with the guardian. 
But because the judge has to decide what to do based on the best 
interests of the children (see the section called “If there’s a custody 
battle” earlier in this chapter), not on the wishes of the people asking 
for custody, it’s possible that the judge won’t give custody to either 
the surviving parent or the guardian appointed by will.
If one parent is already dead and 
then the second parent dies
If the second parent to die appointed a guardian by will, in almost all 
provinces the guardian will get custody of the children if the guard-
ian agrees to the appointment — unless someone else applies to be 
guardian (and/or asks the court to remove the testamentary guard-
ian). Then it’s up to the courts to choose the guardian.
In some provinces, it’s up to the courts even if no one else wants 
custody or objects to the guardian: the appointment under the will 
lasts for only 90 days. During that time the guardian by will must 
apply to the court for a formal custody order. The other provinces 
have no legal requirement for the guardian under the will to get a 
court order granting custody. However, such an order may be nec-
essary or at least desirable if the guardian wants to receive money 
left for the children’s care, to register the children in school, or 
to consent to medical treatment for them. Financial institutions, 
schools, and doctors are apt to want proof of guardianship, and 
it’s more reassuring to them to see a court order than a will.
If a guardian is appointed by will but other relatives and friends 
want custody in spite of the testator’s choice, then everyone goes 
roaring off to court. In choosing among the various applicants, a 
judge doesn’t have to decide that the guardian under the will is 
unfit before picking someone else to have custody. The judge will 
take the testator’s wishes into account, but will make a choice 
based on the best interests of the children. (This takes us back to 
the section on custody battles again.)
 
Sounds like the guardian appointed by will may spend more time in 
court than with the kids. A testator who doesn’t want the chosen 
guardian to feel oppressed (or bankrupt) from the very beginning 
should include a provision in the will that the estate will pay the 
guardian’s legal costs.
Helping to ensure your choice 
of guardian is respected
You looked your family and friends over and chose as testamen-
tary guardian the person you thought would best care for your 

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Children’s Future 137
children. But when you’re gone, your choice won’t necessarily be 
respected. People you rejected out of hand may show up yelling 
“Me, me!” and the judge (who’s never met you, your kids, or any 
of the would-be guardians) may second-guess you and make his or 
her own choice. Is there any way you can get a little more control 
over the situation?
You may have noticed that “the best interests of the children” is a 
recurring theme when it comes to awarding custody of children. In 
order to make your choice of guardian stick, you can try to arrange 
things so that the court will be convinced that going with your 
choice will also be acting in the children’s best interests.
How do you perform this trick? You have to start while you’re 
still alive. When you choose someone to be guardian, if possible 
choose a person whose relationship with your children satisfies a 
good number of the “best interests of the children” factors. Look 
for a potential guardian who
 
✓ Is a relative (by blood or marriage).
 
✓ Has strong emotional ties with the children.
 
✓ Is living with the children (if not, then a person with whom the 
children would like to live . . . of course, your children may be 
at a stage when they’d like to live with anyone except you).
 
✓ Is able to look after the children.
 
✓ Can come up with good plans for the care and upbringing of 
the children.
 
✓ Lives in a stable family relationship.
And don’t forget that the potential guardian should be someone 
who’ll agree to be guardian. Make sure you ask before sticking a 
name in your will. “Sneak-up” or surprise guardianship doesn’t 
work too well.
What if you don’t know anyone who has a close relationship with 
your children — the kind of relationship the court will be looking 
for when deciding whether your choice of guardian is okay? Then 
it’s time to get to work and create such a relationship. Keep in 
touch with whichever members of your family you consider fit to 
look after your kids, and encourage some bonding between them 
and the children. If your family looks hopeless, see whether any 
of your friends are suitable. And don’t pin your hopes on just one 
individual — you may want to name an alternate guardian in your 
will in case your first choice gets cold feet.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
138
Looking at a Guardian’s 
Responsibilities
What exactly will your child’s guardian be required to do? In this 
section we spell out what goes into being a guardian and how you 
can provide instructions to him or her.
Guardian of the person and 
guardian of the property
If you appoint a person the guardian of a child and nothing is said 
to limit the guardian’s appointment, that person has the right and 
the responsibility to
 
✓ Care for the child and make decisions about how the child is 
raised (have custody of the child), and
 
✓ Look after the child’s property.
However, you can appoint one person to care for the child (to 
be the child’s guardian of the person) and another person to look 
after the child’s property (to be the child’s guardian of the estate or 
guardian of the property). In a will, it’s usual to name a guardian of 
the person, and to make the executor the guardian of the property. 
The two guardians may be the same person or they can be differ-
ent people. We’ll talk more about choosing your guardians later in 
this chapter.
Instructions for the guardian(s)
Instructions to the guardian of the property are usually left in the 
will. It’s best to set up a testamentary trust for minor children, 
then the person looking after the property will be your trustee. We 
discuss this further in “Providing for Your Children Financially” 
later in this chapter.
You should discuss instructions to the guardian of the person face 
to face with the guardian. The better your chosen guardian knows 
you and your children, the more likely he or she is to know your 
values and have a sense of the way you would like your children 
to be raised. You might also want to leave a detailed letter for the 
guardian with your will, in which you set out your wishes about 
your children’s general upbringing, their religious training and 
education, and the values you would like them to have. These 

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Children’s Future 139
instructions are not legally binding, but they will give the guard-
ian some guidance and perhaps comfort. The letter will also be a 
useful tool in the guardian’s hands when your children claim that if 
their parents were still alive they would have let them ____ (fill in 
the blank).
Providing for Your Children 
Financially
When you’re thinking about what will happen to your children 
after you die, you’ve got to give some thought to the money that 
your children will live on until they’re old enough to earn their own 
living.
Determining where the money 
will come from
In most provinces, a person who is appointed guardian of a child is 
not required to spend his or her own money to support the child. 
That leaves it up to you.
So what do you have to offer? It’s the money and property you’ve 
left your children under your will, plus any insurance proceeds 
and pension benefits they’re entitled to receive. If you’re not sure 
whether you’ve arranged your affairs to provide properly for your 
children, check out Chapter 4 on life insurance. Do some calculat-
ing and then some planning.
Considering how the money 
will be managed
If you leave money or property to children under the age of major-
ity (18 or 19 depending on the province), you should set up a trust 
for the children in your will. (We talk about trusts for minors in 
Chapter 6, but thinking about your poor orphaned children may 
encourage you to read more carefully when we go over it again 
here.) If you leave property directly to a child under the age of 
majority, the provincial government will manage it according to 
rules set out by provincial law until the child comes of age. The 
government will keep the child’s money invested in very conserva-
tive investments and will give money to the person with custody 
only if it approves of how he or she plans to spend the money on 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
140
the child. When the child comes of age, the government will turn 
all the money and property over to the child, pat the kid on the 
head, and tell him or her to enjoy. Setting up a trust and making 
your own rules sounds like a much better idea, doesn’t it?
When you create a trust for minors, you instruct the trustee to 
invest the property you’ve left to the children. You can say what 
kinds of investments to make. (Just like the provincial govern-
ment, you’ll probably want safe investments, but you may want 
the trustee to be able to make some slightly riskier investments in 
order to increase the value of the trust property.) Then you can 
also add more detailed instructions about how the trust is to be 
managed. For example, you could tell the trustee to
 
✓ Pay no income to the children. You may want all of the income 
to be reinvested so the capital amount of the property goes 
on growing until the trust ends.
 
✓ Pay part or all of the income earned by the trust property out 
to the children. You may want the children to use the trust 
income for clothes and books, or even sports and vacations. 
You can say exactly what the income can and can’t be used 
for, or you can leave it up to the trustee to decide.
 
✓ Pay out some of the capital annually or as needed, if the 
income earned by the trust property isn’t enough to pay for 
the children’s necessities or activities.
Finally, you instruct the trustee to give the trust property to the 
children when they reach a specified age — 18 or 19 if you trust 
them to act wisely, or a more advanced age like 25 if you don’t. Or 
you can hedge your bets and instruct the trustee to hand over the 
property in stages, say one-third at age 18 or 19, one-third at 21, 
and the last third at 25.
Deciding who will manage 
the money
Your trustee will manage the estate’s money. But you have to 
choose the trustee. You’ll want someone who is honest and who 
is knowledgeable about investments. Both qualities are necessary. 
A dishonest trustee will embezzle your children’s money and an 
ignorant one will lose the money in bad investments. Either way, 
your kids will be left with no money. You’d also like your trustee 
to have good judgment if you’re letting him or her make decisions 
about how much income or capital to pay out and when. And you 
want a trustee who won’t play favourites if you have one trust but 

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Children’s Future 141
more than one child. And of course you want the trustee to have 
the time to take on the job, and the interest in doing it.
If you don’t know anyone who meets all of the qualifications, you 
can name a trust company as your trustee. Trust companies have 
a track record in managing other people’s money, and they don’t 
die before the trust ends, or get sick of the job, or tired of your 
kids. As a compromise you can appoint more than one trustee, 
either two or more individuals or an individual (or individuals) and 
a trust company. If you name more than one trustee, they have to 
act unanimously unless you instructed otherwise.
 
If you think you know the perfect person to be your trustee, don’t 
forget to choose (and name) an alternate trustee as well! If your 
perfect trustee dies and you didn’t mention a second choice, your 
new trustee will be your old trustee’s executor — whom you may 
not know from a hole in the ground.
We’re just full of good advice at the moment. Here’s some more. 
It may be wise to name different people to be the trustee and the 
guardian of the person. First, the skills needed to get teenagers to 
wipe their feet before they come into the house aren’t the same 
skills needed to manage investments. Secondly, having two people 
involved will help to provide a balance between your children’s 
short-term and long-term needs. If you have only one person 
wearing both hats, he might want more money for the children’s 
immediate care than there is income from the trust, and wouldn’t 
hesitate to dig into the capital without giving thought to the future. 
Or she might think that it’s more important to build the property 
than to provide a decent allowance for the children, and not be 
willing to give the kids enough money to enjoy their childhood.
If you name different people to be guardian and trustee, try to 
make sure that they get along reasonably well. You don’t want 
your kids to become a battleground.
Thinking about where your 
children will live
Here’s one last thing to think about: Where will your children live? 
Will they move into the guardian’s home, or will the guardian move 
into yours? This is a decision you should make together with the 
person you name as guardian.
If you decide that your home should be kept for the use of your 
children, you have to make special provisions in your will. You’ll 
have to instruct your executor not to sell the house, or not to sell 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
142
it until (for example) the children reach a certain age, or to deed 
it over to the children when they reach a responsible age. (But if 
you’re wise you’ll give your executor the power to sell your home 
if it’s necessary.) Don’t forget to mention what’s to be done with 
the sale proceeds if and when the house is sold. You’ll also have to 
set aside money in your estate to maintain the house.
If you don’t go through this rigamarole about your home, it will be 
your executor’s duty to sell it and divide the proceeds, along with 
the rest of your estate, among your beneficiaries.

O
ver two and a half million Canadians own their business or 
professional practice, either alone or with others. Are you 
one of them? And have you ever dreamed of your business being 
handed down from generation to generation . . . your portrait hang-
ing on the boardroom wall . . . your descendants and their employ-
ees speaking of you in reverential tones as “our founder”?
Maybe that’s not your fantasy at all. Maybe you’d just as soon your 
kids didn’t follow you into the business you’re in. But even so, 
you’d probably like to pass its value on to your family by selling 
the business and leaving them the money.
This much is sure: If you own your own business, deciding what to 
do with it is an important part of your estate planning. And decid-
ing what to do isn’t the end of it — you’ve got to take action, too. 
Whatever your decision about your business, it’s much more likely 
to work out if you make plans than if you leave everything to chance.
Taking Stock of Your Situation
Your main choice lies between keeping your business in the family 
and selling it to someone outside your family. But deciding what to 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
144
do with your business may not be entirely up to you, depending on 
the nature of your ownership.
If you’re a sole proprietor or the sole or majority owner of the 
shares of a corporation, the decision is pretty much yours. You 
own the business and you can do what you like with it. But, if 
you’re a partner in a business or a minority shareholder in a cor-
poration, your choices are more limited. Your business associates 
very probably have a big say in what’s going to happen.
You may already be sold short
If you have partners or fellow shareholders who together hold 
more shares in the corporation than you do, you don’t have total 
control over your business. Whether you want to sell or you want 
to bring your family in, your partners or the other shareholders 
will have a say. They may be able to prevent you from sharing 
ownership of the business with family members or passing owner-
ship on to them. And they may be able to prevent you from selling 
your ownership interest to an outsider.
If your business is a partnership
To be frank, it’s rather unlikely that you will be able to transfer 
your interest in a partnership to a family member either during 
your lifetime or on your death.
You can transfer your partnership interest in an ongoing business 
to someone else (including a family member) only if your partners 
consent to the transfer. And they won’t consent unless they think 
exchanging you for your family member is good for the business 
and for them as well. If you have a partnership agreement, it may 
require you to transfer your interest directly to your partners if 
you want out. And you can’t add a new partner or partners without 
the consent of your existing partners.
If you die while still a partner in a business, you can’t just leave 
your partnership interest to a family member and assume that he 
or she will take your place. If you have a partnership agreement it 
probably requires your partners only to pay your estate for your 
interest in the business. It almost certainly doesn’t say that the 
partnership has to take on someone you choose to replace you. If 
you don’t have a partnership agreement, the partnership dissolves 
on your death. Then your family members simply inherit your 
share of any property belonging to the partnership. It would be up 
to your former partners and your family to decide whether they 
wanted to re-form the partnership together.

 Chapter 9: What to Do with the Family Firm 145
If your business is a corporation
If your business is a corporation, you have to bring in new owners 
by transferring shares in the corporation to them. Anyone can buy 
shares in a public corporation on the stock market (although usu-
ally only the very rich can buy enough shares to get any kind of 
control over the business). But in a private corporation — which 
is the only kind of corporation you would be turning over to your 
family or selling to an outsider — the shareholders and/or the 
directors of the corporation have to give their consent before 
shares can be transferred. If you’re not the only shareholder or not 
the majority shareholder of your corporation, it may be difficult 
or impossible to persuade all the necessary people to allow you 
to transfer your shares to a family member, or to anyone else for 
that matter. Just like partners, shareholders and directors don’t 
want new owners wandering in off the street. (You’d also need con-
sent to get the corporation itself to give or sell new shares to your 
family member.)
 
In addition, if you’re thinking of selling, it’s highly unlikely that 
an outsider would want to buy a minority share in a private cor-
poration, even if the other shareholders agreed to the purchase. 
Actually, your family member may not thank you for a minority 
interest either. The only real market for minority shares in a pri-
vate corporation is the other shareholders of the corporation.
You may have options
If you’re a sole proprietor or majority shareholder in a corpora-
tion, you’re going to be able to decide for yourself whether to bring 
family members into the business — or whether to sell the busi-
ness and pass its value on that way.
If you’re bullish on keeping your business in the family you might 
be interested to know that, according to the Family Firm Institute, 
an international organization that assists family businesses, “While 
the majority of family business owners would like to see their 
business transferred to the next generation, it is estimated that 70 
percent will not survive into the 2nd generation and 90 percent will 
not make it to the 3rd generation.” So even if nothing’s stopping 
you from passing your business on to your children, your chances 
of creating a commercial dynasty are small.
So should you try to keep the business in the family, or should you 
sell? To make your decision, you’ll have to start thinking about 
the nature of your business, the abilities and interests of your chil-
dren, and your own temperament.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
146
Looking at your business
The characteristics of your business itself may determine whether 
or not it can be passed successfully on to the next generation. If it 
can’t, our recommendation is to sell. If you could use a little help 
pondering this matter, here are some points to consider:
 
✓ Must your business be operated by someone with special 
training or expertise? If you are a licensed professional or a 
skilled tradesperson, your business probably can’t be carried 
on by a family member who isn’t qualified in that trade or 
profession.
 
✓ Can your business get along without you or are you the busi-
ness? Is your business based solely on your particular skills, 
talents, and/or personality? If that’s the case, maybe no one, 
inside or outside your family, can take it over successfully. It 
only has value — income value — as long as you’re running it, 
and there may be no value to pass on.
 
✓ How much is your business worth as a going concern? Is it 
worth enough to pass it on to all of your children who are 
interested in sharing in it? In other words, will they all be 
able to earn a decent living from it, either right away or after 
they’ve used their skills to expand it? Or will they starve? If 
the business won’t support them, you would be doing them a 
favour to sell it and pass on the proceeds instead.
 
✓ How much has your business gone up in value since you 
started it? Selling your interest in your business or transfer-
ring it to a family member other than your spouse could trig-
ger a capital gain or loss. (See Chapter 3.) If your business is 
a corporation, up to $750,000 of any capital gain may be tax 
free because of the capital gains deduction permitted under 
the Income Tax Act for qualifying small business corporations. 
If your business is a sole proprietorship or partnership, no 
deduction is available. Will you have enough other money and 
property (or life insurance) to pay the tax on any capital gain 
that pops up when you give your business to your children? 
If you don’t, selling your business may be the only way you’ll 
get the money needed to pay the tax due.
Considering the candidates before 
handing over the business
Assume your business meets the requirements to be handed on 
to your children. Now, look at your children. The character and 
talents of your family members will determine whether it’s wise or 
even possible to pass your business on to the next generation.

 Chapter 9: What to Do with the Family Firm 147
First of all, is there anyone in your family who is interested in 
taking over your business and who has the talent and ability to be 
successful? If your only child or all of your several children have 
the desire and the talent to carry on, you could be all set to start 
dynasty building.
Do none of your children have the talent to carry on (whether 
interested in doing so or not)? Again, you’re all set — to sell to an 
outsider. There’s no point in letting your children take over just to 
run the business into the ground. It will be best for them if you sell 
the business and give them the money to finance other enterprises 
they’re better suited for.
But those two scenarios aren’t the end of the possibilities. What if . . .
 
✓ You have several children, and they’re all interested but only 
some are talented. Do you cause family strife by taking on 
some and rejecting the others? If you believe that taking on 
only some of your children will cause a lot of harm to your 
family, and you care more about your family than about your 
business, then you should consider a sale.
 
✓ You have several children with the interest and talent (whether 
they represent all of your children or only some of them). 
Do they get along well enough with each other that it’s safe 
to bring them all in? Have their dispute resolution skills 
improved since they fought as children over the TV remote 
and whose turn it was to walk the dog? If they can’t get along 
well as people, they’ll have trouble getting along as partners, 
and an enforced partnership is almost certainly doomed.
 
✓ You have talented, interested children who get along well with 
each other. But are they capable of working with and learn-
ing from you? Will they be willing to wait until you’re ready to 
hand control over to them, or will they try to force you out of 
the business before you are ready?
One last (somewhat gloomy) thought here. If it’s a commercial 
empire you have in mind, even if your children get along well 
enough to cooperate as partners themselves, they may have 
trouble cooperating when it comes time to choose among their 
own children as their successors. That’s the stage at which the 
McCain family business came unglued. There’s a reason for that 
old expression, “Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations”!
If you have more than one child and you decide (for various 
reasons, not restricted to those discussed above) to turn your 
business over to one or some of them rather than to all of them — 
what are you going to do about the children who’ve been left out 
of the business?

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
148
Your business has value. It may even be the most valuable thing 
you own. You may not care that you’re not treating all your chil-
dren equally in your estate plan by cutting some of them out of the 
business. But then again, you may care very much about acting 
fairly toward everyone.
There are solutions to the problem of an unequal distribution of 
your estate, short of selling the business to an outsider, to save 
you a lot of grief. Here are some of them:
 
✓ You may have enough other money and property or enough 
life insurance that you’ll be able to divide your estate equally 
among your children anyway.
 
✓ You may decide to make a gift of only part of the value of the 
business, and require your chosen successor to buy the rest 
of the business’s value from you or your estate — so that you 
have enough money to leave equal shares to your other chil-
dren. (Before you go for this solution, consider whether the 
business generates enough income for your child to be able 
to afford the purchase price you’re asking. You don’t want to 
sink your successor into debt.)
 
✓ You may decide to give ownership of the business to all of 
your children on the understanding that only one of your chil-
dren will operate the business. In this case you have to con-
sider whether the business is profitable enough to support 
several owners, and whether the silent partners are capable 
of actual silence.
Looking at yourself
Now, what about you? Can you do whatever is necessary to ensure 
a smooth transfer of control of your company to your children? 
Are you a floor trader at heart, working for yourself alone? Or are 
you the kind of person who can give up control of your business 
before you die, if that’s what it will take to make the transition suc-
cessful? Ask yourself:
 
✓ Can you bring yourself to choose a successor at all?
 
✓ Are you truly willing to involve your children in the ownership 
and/or control of your business before you retire?
 
✓ Are you capable of working with and perhaps for your chil-
dren, rather than always being the boss?
If you answered no to any of these questions, you’re probably not 
a good candidate for founder of a dynasty.

 Chapter 9: What to Do with the Family Firm 149
Timing the Market
When’s the best time to pass on your business or sell it? When 
you’re hale and hearty, or when you’re dead?
You may start thinking about this question in terms of when’s the 
best time for you — when will you be ready to leave. Do you want 
to walk away from your business (and maybe out to the beach or 
golf course)? Hobble away? Or be carried out in a box?
Your personal preferences loom large, but they have to be bal-
anced against other factors.
If you hold for the family
If you’re going to hand over ownership of your business to your 
family, when should you do it? Take these factors into account:
 
✓ When can you afford to retire from the business? If you don’t 
have other income and investments to live on, and if your suc-
cessors won’t make enough from the business to pay you for 
it while they run it, you may have no choice but to hang on to 
the business yourself until you die.
 
✓ When can you afford the tax on the capital gain? If your busi-
ness has gone up in value, you may have to pay capital gains 
tax when you transfer ownership of the business. If you don’t 
have sufficient other money and property to be able to pay 
the tax without having to liquidate the business, you may 
have to hold on to the business until you die. At that point, 
life insurance you’ve bought for the purpose will help your 
estate cover the tax on the capital gain.
 
✓ Do you expect your business to continue to go up in value? 
If so, you may want to consider some form of estate freeze 
fairly soon that involves transfer of ownership (although not 
necessarily control) away from you. (See Chapter 3 for more 
on estate freezes.) If you do an estate freeze on your business, 
you may or may not have to pay capital gains tax on the cur-
rent value of the business. But either way, future increases 
in value will belong to your children and will not be taxable 
in your hands. Your children won’t have to pay any tax on 
increases in value until they dispose of the business.
Even if you decide that you can’t afford to hand over ownership 
before you die, you should consider handing over control of your 
business — or at least partial control — while you’re still alive. 
Bringing your family into the business while you’re still around will 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
150
increase their chances of successfully carrying on the business 
because
 
✓ They will have the opportunity to learn about the business 
from an expert — you.
 
✓ Your clients or customers will have an opportunity to get to 
know your children and transfer their trust and loyalty (now 
yours alone) to them.
If you decide to sell
If you’re planning to sell your business, you want to sell it for the 
highest possible amount. So you want to sell it when it’s most valu-
able. Is that when it’s a going concern? Or when you’re finished 
with business life — well, with life in general — and your executor 
may be selling off just the business’s property?
Most businesses are worth more as a going concern than as a col-
lection of assets. And usually your business will be worth even 
more as a going concern if you’re still around. A business that’s in 
business has goodwill, which can be loosely defined as the likeli-
hood that customers will keep coming back. If you stick around 
for a while after a new owner takes over, the customers are more 
likely to do that. For another thing, you can offer a buyer your 
expertise by agreeing to stay on while the buyer learns the ropes 
and gets to know your customers.
And there’s yet another reason to sell while you’re alive. You can 
arrange to have the sale price paid to you in instalments spread 
out over several taxation years, and so reduce the tax payable on 
any capital gain. If you cling to your business until you die, you 
are deemed to have disposed of it at your death. Then your estate 
has to receive the full proceeds all at once and pay any taxes due 
in that same taxation year. This will come at a really bad time 
because you’re deemed to have disposed of your non-business 
assets as well, and your estate will have to pay tax on any result-
ing capital gains. Just for fun, don’t forget that everything in your 
RRSPs not left to your spouse will be considered income and be 
taxed as well.
Placing Your Orders
After you’ve made the big decision — family succession or outside 
sale — you have to carry it out. In this section we look at what 
steps you need to take.

 Chapter 9: What to Do with the Family Firm 151
If your business is a 
sole proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is fairly easy (from a legal point of view) 
either to transfer or sell. The business is essentially the assets 
(property) that the proprietor owns personally and uses to carry 
on the business. Once the sole proprietor has decided what to do, 
he or she can act right away.
Keeping it in the family
If you want to hand over your business to a family member during 
your lifetime, you’ll have to legally transfer ownership of all of the 
assets of the business. (You’ll trigger a capital gain for yourself if 
your assets have gone up in value.)
If you want to hand over your business on your death, you will 
need a properly drafted will that leaves the assets of the business 
to your chosen successor(s). (See Chapter 13 for more on wills.)
 
If you’ve decided on an estate freeze you’ll need to make extra 
plans. An estate freeze is a lot more complicated than simply 
handing over your assets during your lifetime or leaving them in 
your will. (See the “Timing the Market” section in this chapter and 
Chapter 3 for more on estate freezes.)
You’ll probably want your successor to get not only the assets 
of the business but also all of the debts of the business. If you’re 
giving your business away during your lifetime, you’ll have to make 
some arrangements with your successor and your creditors for 
the payment of your business debts. If you’re giving your business 
away in your will, your estate will be responsible for paying its 
debts. That could have the effect of reducing other family mem-
bers’ share of your estate — so take this into account when you’re 
making your estate plan.
Selling outside the family
Selling to an outsider is much the same as transferring to a family 
member — you transfer ownership of the assets used in your busi-
ness to the purchaser and make arrangements for the payment of 
your business debts.
 
At the time of the sale, you’ll want some tax advice about reducing 
the taxes payable on any capital gain you’ve triggered by the sale. 
For example, you may be able to arrange for the price to be paid to 
you in instalments spread out over several taxation years.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
152
If your business is a partnership
If you’re a partner in a business, your best plan probably is to 
have your partners buy your interest when you retire or die. That 
means you need a partnership agreement that deals specifically 
with retirement and death.
If you have no partnership agreement or you have one but it 
doesn’t deal with retirement and death issues, your partnership 
will simply dissolve when you leave or die (the exception is a 
declared partnership in Quebec). If you have a two-person partner-
ship, it will dissolve when you leave or die whether or not you 
have a partnership agreement. Once you reach the point of retire-
ment or death, you (or your estate) will be at a disadvantage when 
it comes to negotiating a price for your interest in the partnership 
or your share of the partnership assets. That’s because your part-
ners aren’t required to buy you out, and they may not have the 
money to buy you out anyway. And they have to agree before you 
can sell to an outsider — assuming you can find one who wants to 
join this partnership.
To prevent this financially unpleasant situation from coming to 
pass, you need a partnership agreement that deals with what hap-
pens when a partner wants to leave or retire or die. And you need 
it now, before you’re actually ready to leave or retire or die.
 
You’ll need to speak to a business lawyer about this, but your 
agreement should include the following:
 
✓ A buy-out clause or a buy-sell clause. If one partner wants out, 
either the rest of the partners buy that partner out or (usu-
ally only in small firms) that partner buys out all the other 
partners. (If no one is willing to buy, then the partnership is 
dissolved.)
 
✓ A retirement clause. The other partners buy out a partner 
who wants to retire. The clause will say how the price of the 
buy-out is to be calculated (the buy-out money will probably 
have to be borrowed).
 
✓ A clause that requires the other partners to buy the interest 
of a partner who has died from the dead partner’s estate.
 
✓ A clause that requires the partners to have life and disability 
insurance on each other. The insurance proceeds can help fund 
a buy-out triggered by the death or disability of a partner.

 Chapter 9: What to Do with the Family Firm 153
A partnership agreement that allows partners to sell their partner-
ship interest to an outsider if the other partners approve of the 
new partner is possible but uncommon.
If your business is a corporation
To transfer or sell your ownership interest in a corporation, you 
have to transfer or sell shares in the corporation. That sounds 
easy enough, but it isn’t always that easy in practice.
Keeping it in the family
If you’re the only or the majority shareholder in your business cor-
poration, you’re free to transfer your shares to whomever you like. 
You don’t need anyone’s consent if you’re the sole shareholder or 
the majority shareholder. So you’ll simply sign the shares over to 
your family member while you’re alive, or leave the shares in your 
will.
If you’re just one of the shareholders and are not the majority 
shareholder, you’ll need the consent of at least some of the other 
shareholders and/or the directors of the corporation to hand over 
your shares to anyone. If you want to be able to give or leave your 
shares to a family member, it would be best if you had a sharehold-
ers’ agreement that says you can do that. You’ll need to negoti-
ate the agreement with your fellow shareholders before the time 
comes for you to make your dynasty-building move. The other 
shareholders may want their children to come into the business as 
well, so the corporation could have interesting times ahead.
Selling to an outsider
If you’re the only shareholder or the majority shareholder, again 
you can do whatever you like with the corporation. You’re free to 
sell it to the buyer of your choice. (Unhappy minority shareholders 
may have a right to complain to the court about what you’re doing, 
however.) You can sell a business corporation either by selling all 
of the corporation’s assets or by selling its shares.
 
Whether you choose an asset sale or a share sale will depend 
largely on the tax consequences for you — consult your lawyer 
and accountant before you start negotiating a deal with a buyer.
If you’re not the only shareholder or the majority shareholder, for 
all practical purposes your market is limited to your fellow share-
holders or the corporation. But if you want to sell to either, you’ll 
need to do some advance planning because without a sharehold-
ers’ agreement in place,

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
154
 
✓ Neither the shareholders nor the corporation are automati-
cally required to buy your shares.
 
✓ Neither the shareholders nor the corporation are required to 
offer a fair price for your shares.
 
✓ Even if the corporation and/or the shareholders want to buy 
your shares, they may not have enough money.
The upshot is, you want a shareholders’ agreement that requires 
the other shareholders or the corporation to buy your shares from 
you or your estate and that says how the price is to be calculated. 
The agreement should also require the shareholders to be insured 
(life and disability insurance) so that money will be available to 
fund a share purchase on the death or disability of a shareholder. 
(If you just leave and don’t die, the shareholders or corporation 
will probably have to borrow money to pay for your shares.) You 
may also want the agreement to give you or your estate the right 
to terminate the corporation’s existence, so you can get your share 
of the corporation’s property if the other shareholders or the cor-
poration can’t buy your shares.
Hedging Your Bets
What if you were to die tomorrow?
Oops — sorry to be so abrupt. Are you okay? That was a nasty 
bump. Anyway, at least we’re not asking you to think about dying 
today.
So far we’ve been talking about long-term planning for your busi-
ness. But you must also think about what would happen to your 
business if you were to die or become incapacitated suddenly, 
before your long-term plan has played itself out. The odds are that 
plan would not be appropriate to deal with your unexpected death 
or illness.
What do we suggest? You need to line up an emergency replace-
ment for yourself, have insurance in place, and put the right 
clauses in your will.
Someone who can step in
Whatever your current situation and your long-term plans, you 
should make sure that there is someone who can step in and run 
your business, at least in the short term, if you were to die or 
become disabled suddenly.

 Chapter 9: What to Do with the Family Firm 155
Who should that someone be?
If you plan to turn over your business to a family member and your 
successor is working in the business and is ready to take over, 
then your long-term plan will work in the short term as well. Your 
successor will simply get the nod before he or she expected it.
If you plan to turn over your business to your family but your chil-
dren are either too young or too inexperienced to take over from 
you, the problem is harder to solve. You have to ask whether it’s 
realistic to try to keep the business going until they are ready to 
take over. Does it make more sense to change direction and sell 
the business instead? But either way, you’ll need someone to look 
after the business for the time being. That person could be your 
spouse or one of your senior employees, or a manager hired by 
you (or by your attorney under your power of attorney if you can 
no longer think straight), or your executor.
What should that someone know?
Your emergency replacement should have some basic knowledge 
of the business — what the business does and how it operates. 
The more the person knows the better, but he or she should at 
least know the following:
 
✓ The names of your business’s suppliers and customers or 
clients.
 
✓ Where to find your business records — corporate documents, 
major contracts, banking documents, insurance policies, 
accounts payable, accounts receivable, and so on.
 
✓ The name of the business’s accountant. Your accountant 
will have information about the general financial health of 
the business, including details of major debts and sources of 
income.
 
✓ The name of the business’s bookkeeper. The bookkeeper will 
have information about the day-to-day finances of the com-
pany, such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and 
payroll information, and will probably know the names of the 
business’s customers and suppliers and where most of the 
business records can be found.
 
✓ The name of the business’s lawyer. Your lawyer has informa-
tion about the structure of the business and perhaps also 
about its major contracts.
 
✓ The name and address of the business’s bank, including the 
name of the bank manager. Your emergency replacement 
should have enough information to persuade a bank that has 
loaned the business money not to demand payment but to 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
156
allow the business to continue to operate (either indefinitely 
or until a buyer is found).
 
✓ The names of senior employees who have knowledge about 
and can help with the day-to-day operation of the business.
Insurance for your business
If you die or become disabled, your business is going to need 
money to help fend off the bears. It will need the following:
 
✓ Money to pay the debts of the business if the bank decides to 
demand payment on its loans.
 
✓ Money to pay for someone to run the business or to help your 
family run the business.
  
✓ Money to cover any reduction in the business’s income as a 
result of your incapacity or death — to help cover ongoing 
expenses until the business is either back on its feet or sold.
 
✓ Money to pay the tax on any capital gain resulting from the 
deemed disposition of the business if you die. (See Chapter 3 
for more on capital gains tax.)
The best way to make sure that your business will have the money 
it needs is to have the right kind of insurance in the right amount. 
So call your insurance agent. You may need to take out these kinds 
of insurance:
 
✓ Overhead insurance: A form of disability insurance that pays 
the fixed expenses of your business while you’re temporarily 
out of commission.
 
✓ Life insurance: A policy on your life, payable to your estate, 
your spouse, or your children, that will provide money to pay 
the tax on the capital gain as a result of the deemed disposition 
of your business on your death (tax law assumes that you sell 
all your property just before you die, as we explain in Chapter 
3) or other business debts for which your estate is responsi-
ble. Alternatively, the money can be plowed into the business.
 
✓ Key person insurance: Life insurance that your business 
takes out on your life because you’re essential to the running 
of the business. The insurance proceeds provide the business 
with money to cover any expenses that must be paid to help 
the business survive — the cost of a replacement for you, con-
sulting costs, debt payments, and so on.

 Chapter 9: What to Do with the Family Firm 157
At the close
Since you can’t know when you’re going to die, you should draft 
the business-related parts of your will as if you’re going to die 
tomorrow, in accordance with your short-term emergency plan. 
Your short-term plan may not necessarily be the same as your 
long-term plan, but you can and should revise your will as circum-
stances change.
 
✓ If you’re grooming your children to take over from you and 
they’re now ready to step in at a moment’s notice, you can 
safely leave your business to them.
 
✓ If your children aren’t ready to take over immediately but 
should be ready in the near future, you could leave your busi-
ness to them — but with instructions to your executor either 
to run the business personally or to hire someone to run the 
business until they are ready.
 
✓ If no one in your family is capable of taking over the business 
for the foreseeable future, you may be wiser to draft your will 
so that your business will be sold. If it was always your inten-
tion to sell your business, draft your will accordingly. But con-
sider giving your executor the discretion and the powers to 
operate your business for a time. Your executor may be able 
to get a better price for the business if it’s still in operation at 
the time of sale.

You Gave at the Office, But . . . : 
Charitable Donations
In This Chapter
▶ Deciding to give to charity
▶ Investigating how to choose a charity
▶ Getting the details right for your donation
▶ Exploring the different ways to give to charity
“I
 gave at the office” is a handy, if trite, way of politely tell-
ing canvassers to see whether your next-door neighbours 
are feeling more charitable. When you’re making your will, though, 
there’s no canvasser on your doorstep. There’s no pressure on 
you, there’s no request, there’s not even a pleading look in some-
one’s eye. The decision to leave something to charity is purely 
voluntary, and nobody needs to know about it except the lawyer 
drafting your will.
In this chapter we help you to think about giving to charity as part 
of your estate plan and (should you decide that giving is a good 
idea) about the best way to do it.
Thinking about Giving to Charity
Even if you never feel that you have enough extra money to give a 
significant amount to charity once the rent or mortgage is paid and 
food put on the table, you can probably afford to make a donation 
out of your estate. First of all, you’re going to be dead and won’t 
need that much cash where you’re going. (Think of the afterlife as 
an “all-inclusive” kind of deal, like an otherworldly Club Med.) And 
secondly, the tax treatment of charitable donations on death can 
help reduce the tax your estate may have to pay.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
160
Looking at the reasons 
to give to charity
Some people secretly equate a charity with themselves. They 
might, for example, donate to organizations that are working to 
cure diseases that the donors are afraid of getting. So if you gave 
to the Cancer Society in the hope that they would find a cure for 
cancer before you got it, and then you got cancer anyway, it’s 
perfectly understandable that you wouldn’t see any point in giving 
them more money in your will.
But if you’re one of the people who takes the longer view — that the 
planet, humans, and other animals and vegetables were here long 
before your entrance and will keep on going after your exit, and that 
they need as much help as they can get whether you personally are 
in or out of this world — then a donation in your will makes sense. 
You can get a lot of satisfaction from knowing that you’ve done one 
last thing for your community or for a cause that means a lot to you.
Considering how much to give
If you have family members who are financially dependent on you, 
your first obligation, both morally and legally, is to them. (See 
Chapter 7.) It doesn’t matter that the rainforest tree toads are 
endangered or that your favourite post mortem fantasy involves 
looking down from above and seeing your name inscribed on a 
plaque praising your generosity. You can’t give more than a token 
amount to charity if you’re not leaving enough in your estate to 
look after your dependent spouse or children.
But if your family is properly cared for, you can kick up your chari-
table heels.
 
✓ If you have no family at all, or none that you’re speaking to, 
and no close friends, you may want to leave your entire estate 
to charity. This sounds horrifically depressing . . . maybe if 
you tell the charity in advance that you’re leaving your whole 
estate to them they’ll send someone over to befriend you.
 
✓ If you have family and friends but no one who actually needs 
your money as much as the endangered tree toads do, you 
may want to leave personal possessions with sentimental 
value and some of your money to the friends and relations, 
and leave the balance of your estate to charity.
 
✓ If you want or need to leave most of your estate to family or 
friends, you may want to calculate how much you can spare 
for charity.

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 161
Exploring the tax advantages 
to leaving money to charity
Isn’t it amazing the way that we keep intertwining the highly enter-
taining topic of taxes with the mesmerizing topic of death?
Charity that begins at home
If you leave money or property to a registered Canadian charity 
in your will, your estate will be able to claim a tax credit in the 
return filed for the last year of your life, your terminal return. The 
tax credit reduces the tax that your estate pays on the income you 
earned before you died and on the taxable capital gains that your 
estate may have because of the deemed disposition of all of your 
property when you die (Canada Revenue assumes that you sell 
everything you own just before death) — not to mention the tax 
your estate will have to pay because your RRSPs are deemed to be 
cashed in when you die. (If none of this is ringing a bell with you, 
take our remedial tax course in Chapter 3.)
 
When you make charitable donations during your lifetime, the 
maximum that you can claim is 75 percent of the net income 
reported on your income tax return. But if charitable donations are 
made through your will or after your death, your estate can claim 
donations up to your total net income. And if the charitable dona-
tions in your will are greater than the net income in your final tax 
return, your executor can refile your tax return for the year before 
you died, and use the excess donation to get a tax credit to reduce 
that year’s taxes. (Your estate will get a refund.)
There’s quite a bit more to this tax stuff — including ways to get 
the biggest tax bang for your charitable buck — and we will inflict 
it on you in the section called “Looking at the Ways to Give to 
Charity.”
Charity that begins abroad
If you want to give to a charity in another country, you don’t nec-
essarily have to forget about tax breaks here in Canada. A few 
foreign charities (in particular, U.S. educational institutions) have 
the same tax status in Canada as registered Canadian charities. 
Canada also has tax treaties with many other countries, and the 
provisions of the treaty with your charity’s country may offer you 
some tax benefits. Before you make a donation to a foreign char-
ity you should contact the charity itself and also Canada Revenue 
for advice. If you’re thinking of making a significant donation, you 
should consult a Canadian tax lawyer.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
162
 
Don’t overlook the fact that many Canadian-registered charities 
work in foreign countries — the Red Cross, for example, many 
religious organizations, and organizations devoted to education, 
health, and the environment. So you may be able to do good 
abroad and do well tax-wise here at home too.
Choosing the Right Charity
You may already have a favourite charity and you’re planning to 
stick with it, dead or alive. But if you’re not committed to a particu-
lar charity, how should you decide which one(s) to give to? You 
may want to take several things into account, not necessarily in 
the following order:
 
✓ The charity’s purpose
 
✓ The charity’s honesty and integrity
 
✓ The percentage of charitable donations that is used for chari-
table purposes (rather than for fundraising and other adminis-
trative costs)
 
✓ Whether the charity is registered with Canada Revenue
 
✓ Whether the charity is willing to accept your donation
 
✓ Whether the charity is willing to use your donation as you 
direct
 
✓ The kind of recognition that you will be given for your 
donation
A charity that does the 
right kind of good
You may want to make a donation to a specific charity because it’s 
active in an area that’s important to you, or as a gesture of support 
and thanks. For example you may want to donate to
 
✓ An organization that supports a cause that you believe in
 
✓  Your church, synagogue, or mosque
 
✓ A charity that has helped you, a family member, or a friend 
during an illness
 
✓ An organization that carries on research about a disease that 
has affected you, a family member, or a friend
 
✓ A hospital in which you, a family member, or a friend were 
well cared for

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 163
 
✓ A school, college, or university that you or a family member 
attended
 
✓  A performing arts group whose productions you enjoyed
A charity that’s not good 
enough to be true
If you like a charity’s objectives, you should check out some other 
matters too — especially if the charity is not well known.
Not every organization that requests money from the public for 
charitable purposes is what it appears to be. Money collected 
from donations may be going to the founders or administrators of 
the charity rather than to the stated goals of the charity. In other 
words, it’s a scam.
Another point: Some charities are better than others at managing 
themselves efficiently. You would like to know how much of your 
donation will be spent on fundraising and administration and how 
much will be spent on a charitable purpose. In other words, will 
your donation go to the tree toads or to a receptionist?
 
A good way of answering questions about a charity’s legitimacy 
and efficiency is to find out whether the charity is registered with 
Canada Revenue. Charities must meet strict criteria to become reg-
istered and to stay registered (see the next section). You can also 
question representatives of the charity directly, but they may not 
be in a hurry to tell you what you want to know.
A charity that’s on good terms 
with Canada Revenue
When you make a charitable donation, you’ll get a tax credit for it 
only if the charity is registered with Canada Revenue. To qualify 
for registration, an organization must
 
✓ Be set up and operated for charitable purposes and devote its 
resources to charitable activities. Canada Revenue recognizes 
four general categories of charitable purposes: relief of pov-
erty, advancement of education, advancement of religion, and 
other purposes that benefit the community such as disaster 
relief; prevention and treatment of sickness and disability; 
care or protection of children, the elderly, people with special 
needs, and animals; and protection of the environment.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
164
 
✓ Be resident in Canada.
 
✓ Provide a real benefit to the public (either the whole public 
or a significant part), and not use its income to benefit its 
members.
 
✓ Engage only in legal activities and, further, engage only in 
activities that aren’t contrary to public policy.
 
Some organizations may look like charities without being charities 
in the eyes of Canada Revenue. Service clubs and fraternal lodges, 
for example, are not considered charities because they provide 
social events for members even if they also provide services to the 
general community. (A separate organization for their charitable 
activities would qualify for registration as a charity.) Funds set up 
to accept donations for an individual (say a child awaiting surgery) 
or small group (say a family that lost their home in a fire) are not 
charities because the public as a whole does not benefit.
To stay registered, a charity has to spend at least 80 percent of 
most types of its annual donations directly on charitable activities. 
Charitable activities include paying the salaries of people who per-
form actual charitable work and buying equipment used in chari-
table activities (the doctor and her medical equipment), but do 
not include paying for administrative or fundraising activities (the 
receptionist and his desk). A charity can pay only reasonable sala-
ries to its members. It also has to keep proper records and make 
them available if Canada Revenue wants to inspect them, and it has 
to file an annual information return with Canada Revenue.
 
Canada Revenue maintains a searchable list of registered charities 
at its Web site (www.cra-arc.gc.ca). About 80,000 charities are 
registered with Canada Revenue. But you already knew that, didn’t 
you? Because every last one of them has called you at dinnertime.
A charity that looks a gift horse 
in the mouth
Unless you’re a well-known Colombian drug lord, no charity is 
going to turn down your gift of cash. A charity probably won’t say 
no to publicly traded shares, either, because they can easily be 
turned into cash. (Things may be a little sticky if you try to give 
tobacco company shares to an emphysema society, or shares in an 
arms manufacturer to an organization promoting world peace.) But 
what if you don’t want to give cash or cashable property? What if 
you want to donate your car to a service organization that delivers 
meals to the elderly? What if you want to leave a piece of art to a 

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 165
gallery or museum? What if you want to leave your baseball card 
collection to your church?
Making a gift in kind is not always easy. The meals-on-wheels orga-
nization may not want to own and insure its own vehicles; it may 
want only volunteers’ vehicles to be used for deliveries. The art 
gallery or museum may consider your painting a third-rate work 
by a minor artist, or may be committed to building its collection 
around sixteenth-century Flemish artists and your piece is seven-
teenth century. Your church may not want to be bothered having 
your baseball card collection appraised and finding a buyer so it 
can use the proceeds to fix the furnace.
Check with the charity before you make a firm decision to leave it 
something other than cash in your will.
A charity that can’t take a hint
It’s not that you have a controlling personality . . . it’s just that you 
feel you have a right tell the charity what it should do with your 
money. For example, you may have thought for years that your 
synagogue needed money to create a memorial wall; or you may be 
convinced that your farm property would be perfect for a summer 
camp for inner-city kids.
If you want your gift to be used for a specific purpose, check that 
purpose out with the charity first. The charity may not be willing 
or able to do what you want. Your synagogue may already be using 
all its walls (although it’d love to renovate its kitchen facilities), 
and the inner-city kids’ organization can’t afford to set up and run 
a camp (but it sure could use proceeds from the sale of your land 
to run its after-school program). If the charity cannot carry out 
your request, it may have to refuse your gift.
If the charity of your choice, when consulted, does not want to do 
what you want them to do, you have two choices. You can find 
another charity that will follow your orders. Or you can refocus on 
the charity’s needs rather than your own wishes. If you choose this 
course, you can state in your will the purposes you would like your 
gift to be used for, but then give the charity discretion to decide 
how your gift will be used.
A charity that will put your 
name up in lights
Some people prefer to be anonymous or at least unsung donors, while 
others like to be recognized and remembered (or have someone 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
166
else honoured and remembered) for the contribution they’ve made. 
It won’t be hard to find a charity that will agree not to mention your 
name. It will be harder to find a charity that will recognize your 
donation in the way you’d like. This is a matter you’ll have to take 
up with the charity.
Depending on the size of your donation, the charity of your 
choice may be willing to publish your name in its donor list, put 
your name (or another’s) on a plaque, or give a reception in your 
honour or memory. Charities that have buildings (churches, hos-
pitals, universities, performing arts organizations) may be willing 
to name a room or a wing or even the entire building after you or 
someone of your choice . . . if your donation is big enough.
Making Sure Your Donation Gets 
Where You Want It to Go
Once you’ve decided on a charity, you need to remember two key 
points, which we cover in this section: making sure your money 
goes to the right charity, and making alternate plans in case you 
last longer than the charity does.
Get the charity’s name right
The most important thing is to name the charity correctly. Your 
will should refer to the charity by its full legal name and also give its 
address. This will reduce the chance that two charities with the same 
or similar names will end up fighting over your donation. If you leave 
a gift to the “animal welfare society,” it’s probably not your intention 
that the Humane Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals should end up fighting over it like cats and dogs. The lady 
down the street who takes in strays might even join the free-for-all. 
There have been many lawsuits between competing charities over a 
donor’s will — and it’s not unheard-of for a court to rule that the cost 
of the fray should be financed by the gift in the donor’s will.
 
Tracking down the right name and address of your charity is one 
of the things your lawyer will do when drafting your will. But if 
you’re impatient, you can check Canada Revenue’s searchable list 
of registered charities at its Web site (www.cra-arc.gc.ca), or 
call the charity itself (if you think you know its name, that is).

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 167
Guard against the charity’s 
untimely end
A major charity is not likely to cease to exist between now and the 
time of your death — even if your death is decades away — but 
a small charity just might. It could fold when its present organiz-
ers lose heart about saving the tree toads, or it could join a larger 
organization and lose its objectives in the larger organization’s 
objectives.
 
If you’re concerned that your charity may get to heaven before you 
do, you can name another charity in your will as an alternate. Or in 
your will you can instruct your executor to choose a charity, keep-
ing in mind your interests.
Looking at the Ways 
to Give to Charity
In this section we tell you about the different ways you can donate 
to the charity as a part of the estate planning process, and about 
what it all means from the point of view of taxes.
Planned giving
Many charities, especially the larger ones, have people whose job is to encourage 
donations. They may be called Planned Giving Officers or Development Officers. 
Before you make a final decision about which charity and what donation, you can 
talk to charities’ officers about matters such as
 ✓ The correct name and address of the charity.
 ✓ The charity’s willingness to accept your gift in kind.
 ✓ The charity’s willingness to use your gift for a specific purpose.
 ✓ The charity’s standard wording (if any) for use in your will.
If you’re thinking about making a large donation to the charity, these officers will 
also be thrilled to speak to you about ways to structure your gift, including advice 
on tax and the different ways to give. Listen to them, drink their coffee, and eat their 
cookies, even go out to lunch with them — but be sure to get your own legal and 
financial advice before you make any decision.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
168
Gifts of cash made by will
You can leave cash to a charity in your will in one of two ways:
 
✓ You can make a gift of a specified amount of money to the 
charity. Just make sure that your estate will have enough cash 
or property that is easily converted to cash (such as GICs, 
RRSPs, or RRIFs) to cover the gift. If it doesn’t, the amount of 
the gift does not necessarily get reduced. Instead, your estate 
may have to sell property to get the money for the gift. The 
property sold may be something that you would have pre-
ferred a family member or friend to receive, such as blue-chip 
stocks, a car, or a cottage.
 
✓ Or you can give the charity a share or percentage of the value 
of the residue of your estate — the residue is what’s left in 
your estate after your executor pays your debts and taxes 
and hands out the gifts of cash and property that you made to 
named individuals.
These are the simplest and most common ways to make a donation 
to charity in a will. Your estate will be entitled to a tax credit of 15 
percent of the first $200 in donations and 29 percent of donations 
over $200.
Gifts of specific property 
made by will
Instead of leaving cash to a charity, you can leave specific property 
to the charity (a gift in kind) — for example, stocks or other securi-
ties, real estate, artwork, or a motor vehicle.
Your estate will have to pay capital gains tax on the property if it 
increased in value between the time you got it and the time you 
died. (This is true whether you donate the property or not.) But 
your estate will be entitled to a charitable donation tax credit for 
the property (15 percent of the first $200, and 29 percent of dona-
tions over $200), based on its fair market value at the time of your 
death. The tax credit can wipe out the capital gains tax payable on 
the donated property.
Special tax treatment for gifts of shares
If your gift in kind to a charity is publicly traded shares, your 
estate gets a gift back! The gift is from Canada Revenue and it’s a 
reduction in any taxable capital gain on the shares to zero! Have a 
look at the story of “Ebenezer’s gift.”

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 169
 
If you have both cash and publicly traded shares and you’re think-
ing about making a donation to charity in your will, your estate’s 
tax bill will be lower if you leave the shares to the charity and the 
cash to a relative or friend.
Gifts of life insurance
If you think that there won’t be enough money in your estate to 
fund the charitable donation you’d like to make, you can donate 
the proceeds of a life insurance policy on your own life to the char-
ity you’ve chosen. There are two different ways to do this:
Frank arrives dead
Frank, a successful real estate salesman, owned a solid silver trophy that he had 
received in recognition for his high sales volume. When he got the trophy, it was 
valued at $10,000. In his will he left the trophy to a favourite charity that promoted 
the benefits of atomic energy for all. During a vacation in San Francisco, he incau-
tiously drank a “Glow in the Dark” martini whose active ingredient turned out to be 
radium. In the following 48 hours, he devoted his waning strength to discovering 
the recipe and the identity of the bartender, but finally landed dead on arrival at 
San Francisco General. His executor and the charity, although plunged into grief, 
worked out the tax aspects of the donation. The trophy was now worth $20,000.
Capital gains tax:
Capital gain on the trophy ($20,000 – $10,000) 
$10,000
Taxable capital gain (50% of $10,000) 
$5,000
Tax payable at the top marginal tax rate (approx. 45%) 
$2,250
Charitable donation tax credit: 
15% tax credit on the first $200 of the donation 
$30
29% tax credit on the balance over $200 ($19,800) 
$5,742
Total federal tax credit for the donation 
$5,772
Provincial tax credit (approx. — varies by province) 
$2,342
Total tax credits 
$9,014
The charitable donation credit not only wipes out the capital gains tax payable of 
$2,250 but the remaining $6,764 can be used to reduce the total tax bill of the estate. 
This is an especially good deal considering that nobody, including the deceased’s 
fiancée, Paula, could figure out what to do with the trophy anyway.

✓ You can donate the insurance policy to the charity while you’re 
still alive. You can take out a new policy on your life naming 
the charity as the policy owner and beneficiary, or you can give 
ownership of an existing policy to the charity (the charity will 
name itself the beneficiary if you haven’t already done so).
 
✓ You can hold on to your insurance policy and either name the 
charity as the beneficiary of the policy or name your estate 
as the beneficiary and leave the charity an amount of money 
equal to the life insurance proceeds in your will.
As we show you in the next sections, the tax benefits to you and 
your estate are different depending on which option you choose.
Donating the insurance policy
If you take out a new policy naming the charity as owner or if you 
assign ownership of an existing policy to the charity, the charity 
will become the beneficiary and in all likelihood you’ll pay the pre-
miums. (The charity could pay the premiums, of course, but why 
would it want to? Their business is receiving donations, not making 
them.) When you die, the insurance proceeds will go directly to 
the charity. Charities like this option best because they own the 
policy, not you, and that means you won’t be able to change the 
beneficiary if you should happen to have a difference of opinion 
with the charity or if you just decide you know someone who’ll 
need the money more.
Ebenezer’s gift
Ebenezer, a famously jolly and generous gentleman, owned shares in the publicly 
traded Marley Clanking Chain Corporation. The shares were worth $10,000 when 
Ebenezer inherited them from the corporation’s founder, and they were worth 
$20,000 when he later died laughing. In his will he left the shares to a charity in 
which he had been involved for many years, Christmas Present. Ebenezer’s execu-
tor, Tim Cratchit, worked out the tax consequences of the gift as follows:
Calculation of taxable capital gain in Ebenezer’s estate:
Capital gain on the shares ($20,000 – $10,000) 
$10,000
Normal taxable capital gain. 
$ 5,000
Tax payable on normal taxable capital gain (at approx. 45%, because 
 Ebenezer’s estate easily reaches the top marginal tax bracket) 
$2,250
Taxable capital gain on publicly traded shares donated to charity 
$0
Ebenezer’s estate is still entitled to claim the full charitable donation tax credit 
on the shares’ value of $20,000, which is approximately $9,014 (the exact amount 
depends on the province). This tax credit can be used to reduce the entire tax bill 
of the estate.

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 171
 
When you take out a policy naming the charity as owner, your 
estate will not be able to claim a donation tax credit for the pro-
ceeds paid to the charity when you die (because you didn’t own 
the policy).
The only tax benefit you’ll get is while you’re still alive — any pre-
miums that you pay for the policy are eligible for a donation tax 
credit in your annual tax return. If you donate an existing policy 
with a cash surrender value (that would be permanent insurance, 
as we explain in Chapter 4), you will be able to claim on your tax 
return, in the year you give away the policy, a donation credit 
based on the cash surrender value of the policy.
Keeping the policy
If you keep ownership of the life insurance policy, you can name the 
charity as the beneficiary of the policy, or you can name your estate 
as the beneficiary and leave the same amount of money to the char-
ity in your will. Either way, your estate will be able to claim a dona-
tion tax credit for the amount that is paid to the charity.
You will not be allowed to claim the insurance premiums you pay 
while you’re alive as a charitable donation. But usually the tax 
credit your estate will get on the proceeds when you die will be far 
more than the credit you would be able to claim on the premiums 
while you’re alive.
How do you choose the beneficiary?
If you name the charity as beneficiary, when you die the insur-
ance proceeds will be paid directly to the charity by the insurance 
company. Because the insurance proceeds go to the charity and 
not to your estate, your estate won’t have to pay probate fees on 
the proceeds. (We discuss probate fees in Chapter 3.) So you can 
reduce probate fees by naming the charity as beneficiary. On the 
other hand, if the proceeds don’t go into your estate, they won’t be 
available to pay your taxes and other debts. If there’s not enough 
money in your estate to pay your taxes and debts, the charity will 
still get the full proceeds while gifts to your relatives and friends 
under your will may end up being reduced.
If you name your estate as beneficiary, the insurance proceeds will 
be subject to probate tax, but they will also be available to pay 
your taxes and other debts. If there’s not enough money left over 
to give the full amount of planned gifts to relatives, friends, and 
charities, everyone’s gift will be reduced.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
172
Gifts of RRSP or RRIF proceeds
You can donate the proceeds of your registered retirement savings 
plan or registered retirement investment fund to charity. If you do, 
you can either name the charity as the beneficiary of the RRSP or 
RRIF or you can name your estate as the beneficiary and leave the 
charity an amount of money equal to the proceeds of the plan or 
fund in your will.
The income tax implications are the same either way. When you 
die you are deemed by Canada Revenue to have cashed in all your 
RRSPs and RRIFs immediately before your death. The full amount 
of the RRSPs or RRIFs is added to your income in your terminal 
tax return, and your estate is responsible for paying the income 
tax. (We explain how all this works in Chapter 3.) Your estate will, 
however, be entitled to the usual donation tax credit (15 percent of 
the first $200 in donations, and 29 percent of donations over $200) 
based on the amount of the proceeds.
How should you decide, then, between naming the charity as ben-
eficiary or in giving a gift in your will?
Think about the same things you think about if you are deciding 
how to donate an insurance policy. If you name the charity as 
the beneficiary, the RRSP or RRIF proceeds will not form part of 
your estate and will not be subject to probate tax, but then the 
proceeds won’t be available to pay your taxes and other debts. If 
there’s not enough money to go around, the charity will get the full 
proceeds while gifts to your relatives and friends under your will 
may end up being cut. If you name your estate as beneficiary, the 
RRSP or RRIF proceeds will be subject to probate tax, but they will 
also be available to pay your taxes and other debts. If there’s not 
enough money to go around, everyone’s gift will be reduced.
Charitable gift annuities
You can make a donation to a charity while you’re still alive in 
return for an annuity. But before we explain how a charitable gift 
annuity works, we’d better tell you how an ordinary annuity works.
What’s an annuity?
 
An annuity is an investment you buy from a financial institution, 
usually an insurance company. You pay the financial institution 
a lump sum in return for its promise to pay you a fixed amount of 
money every year for either a set number of years (a fixed-term 
annuity), until you die (a life annuity), or until both you and your 
spouse die (a joint life annuity).

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 173
If you buy a fixed-term annuity, the fixed amount of the payments 
is calculated so as to repay you all the money you invested plus 
interest (at an agreed rate) over the number of years you choose. 
At the end of the term, you will have received all of your money 
back, plus interest. If you die before the term is up, what’s left of 
the annuity will be paid to whomever you name as a beneficiary. 
You pay tax only on the interest portion of the payments, not on 
the repayment portion of the payments.
If you buy a life annuity, the fixed amount of the payments is cal-
culated to repay you all of the money you invested plus interest 
for the number of years you are expected to live. The insurance 
company decides how long you’re likely to live, using the same 
kinds of mortality tables they use to calculate insurance premiums 
(see Chapter 4). If you live exactly as long as the insurance com-
pany expects you to, you’ll receive all of your money back, plus 
interest. If you live longer than the insurance company expects, 
it must keep on paying you the fixed amount until you die. If you 
die earlier than expected, the insurance company gets to keep 
your money — unless you buy a guaranteed annuity, which is more 
expensive. (If you buy a guaranteed annuity and die before a cer-
tain number of years have passed, the insurance company will 
make the rest of the payments to whomever you name as benefi-
ciary.) As with a fixed-term annuity, you pay tax only on the inter-
est portion of the payments, and not on the repayment portion.
A joint life annuity works just like a life annuity. If you buy a joint 
life annuity, the fixed amount of the payments is calculated to 
repay you and your spouse all of the money you invested plus 
interest for the number of years that the two of you are expected 
to live (one of you will probably be expected to live longer than 
the other). If one of you survives the other and lives longer than 
expected, the insurance company has to keep on paying. If you 
both die before expected, the insurance company gets to keep the 
money.
So what’s a charitable gift annuity?
 
A charitable gift annuity is very nearly the same as a regular annu-
ity. You take it out in the ordinary way, either as a fixed-term annu-
ity or a life annuity. The only special feature is that the charity 
gets any remaining value in the annuity after your death, instead 
of another beneficiary or the insurance company. Some charities 
issue their own annuities, others use insurance companies.
Why buy a charitable gift annuity?
If you would like to make a donation to a charity while you’re still 
alive but you need the income from the money to live on, an annu-
ity can be useful. With other kinds of investments, the investor 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
174
worries about preserving the capital so that it can go on producing 
income. With a life annuity, the annuitant (that’s you, the investor) 
isn’t concerned about the shrinkage in the capital because pay-
ments are guaranteed for life — no matter if the capital shrinks 
down to zero and below. The same is true of a term annuity if the 
term is longer than the annuitant truly believes he or she will live. 
Obviously there’s a risk here, but if you outlive your term annuity, 
you may be so tickled to be alive that you won’t care that you’re 
poor.
The charity is agreeable to issuing you an annuity because it’s 
gambling that you’ll die while there’s still capital left. Of course, 
no charity is going to go the annuity route with you if you look like 
you’re going to outlive your capital.
Tax treatment of annuities
You won’t find any plummy little tax surprises here. When you buy 
an annuity from a charity, you don’t get a donation tax credit for 
any of the amount you can expect to receive back over the term of 
the annuity. You’ll get a donation tax credit only if you pay more to 
the charity for the annuity than you can expect to get back. Then 
the credit will be based on the difference between what you paid 
for the annuity and what you’re likely to get back.
When your annuity payments start, they will be made up of repay-
ment of your investment plus interest earned on your investment. 
You’ll have to pay tax on the interest portion of the payments, but 
not on the repayment portion. So you won’t be getting any special 
tax breaks, but you’ll feel as though you are because you’ll be 
paying tax only on part of your total annuity income. Okay, okay, 
we admit this is a pretty pathetic attempt to help you feel upbeat 
about paying taxes.
Charitable remainder trusts
In Chapter 6 on trusts, we tell you about charitable remainder trusts. 
In a charitable remainder trust, you put income-producing property 
into a trust and get the income from the property for as long as you 
(or you and your spouse) are alive. The charity gets the trust prop-
erty when you (or the second of you and your spouse) die.
Some charities promote charitable remainder trusts to donors, 
but it’s not a particularly good idea from the donor’s point of view. 
You do get a tax credit for the donation when the trust is set up, 
but you don’t get a full credit because a real change in ownership 
won’t happen until some time in the future. So the tax credit won’t 
equal the total value of the property put into the trust. Over and 

 Chapter 10: Charitable Donations 175
above that, when you put capital property (anything other than 
cash) into the trust you are deemed to have disposed of it for 
income tax purposes. If the property has gone up in value since 
you acquired it, you will have to pay tax on the capital gain. The 
tax payable on the capital gain may very well be greater than the 
tax credit for the donation. (We tell you about taxes on capital 
gains in Chapter 3.)
Memorial donations
If you want to donate to charity after your death, asking for memo-
rial donations is a way of getting others to make the donation. It’s 
not exactly cheating . . . you could think of it as “leveraging” your 
death. Or you could think of it as exercising power from beyond 
the grave (or urn) to encourage others to be charitable.
Mourners have traditionally sent flowers to funerals in order to 
show their respect, affection, or sympathy. A nice flower arrange-
ment can cost tens or hundreds of dollars, and within a few days 
it’s thrown into the garbage. It’s pretty while it lasts but it’s not 
much use to anyone. So more and more people are asking that 
mourners make a donation to charity rather than sending flowers. 
You can ask that donations be made to the charity of your choice, 
or you can ask that donors give to a charity of their own choice.
 
If you would like memorial donations instead of flowers, let your 
family and executor know while you’re still alive so it can be 
included in your obituary notice. Don’t just leave instructions in 
your will, because it might not be read until after the funeral.

A
s they say, you can’t take it with you. But since you’re leaving 
your body behind, you have to figure out what to do with it. 
This chapter tells you what you need to know in order to pre-plan 
your funeral and the disposal of your body.
Understanding Who Decides 
on the Details
Who gets to decide on the details of your funeral and body dis-
posal? Strangely, in law it’s mostly none of your business what 
happens to your body after you’re dead. If you’ve got an executor, 
it’s the executor’s responsibility to make funeral arrangements — 
and the executor doesn’t have to pay any attention to what you 
wanted or to what your family and friends want. He or she only has 
to make arrangements suitable to your position in life. If you don’t 
have an executor, your closest relative (starting with husband 
or wife but not in most provinces an unmarried partner, then, in 
order, a child, a parent, a brother or sister) gets to decide about 
funeral arrangements. Generally speaking, executors and fami-
lies don’t mind carrying out your wishes — but if yours are a bit 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
178
unusual, it would be wise to run them by your executor and family 
just to make sure they’re okay with them.
Even more strangely, although you’re not allowed the final say 
about what happens to your entire body, you are supposed to get 
the last word about what happens to bits and pieces of it. Each 
province has a law that if an adult consents while alive to organ 
donation, the consent stays valid after death. However, a hospital 
usually won’t accept your organs if you gave your consent but 
your family doesn’t like the idea.
So be warned that you can spend a lot of time planning your 
funeral and signing donor consent forms, and your best-laid plans 
may still go astray.
Considering the High Cost of Death
Dying isn’t expensive (it’s prolonging life that costs so much) — 
but disposing of your body definitely is. You’re easily looking at 
several thousand dollars. And you’re not even going to be there to 
enjoy the festivities! One of the best reasons for pre-planning your 
funeral is to get an idea of exactly what all your hard-earned and 
hard-saved cash is buying.
Funeral expenses are paid by your estate (including any life insur-
ance proceeds), unless your executor and family are saps who 
don’t realize that and pay out of their own pockets. Or unless you 
are eligible for money from the government or some private orga-
nization, which might include
 
✓ A union, club, or fraternal organization of which you are a 
member
 
✓ Your employer, via your employment benefits package
 
✓ Provincial worker’s compensation, if your death is caused by 
a work-related injury or disease
 
✓ The insurance company of a lousy driver who kills you, or 
your own insurer if you’re in a no-fault-insurance province, 
or a provincial uninsured motorist accident claims fund if the 
lousy driver was also an uninsured driver
 
✓ If you’re a veteran, the Last Post fund run by Veterans Affairs 
Canada
 
✓ The social assistance authorities, if you’re on social assis-
tance at the time of your death

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 179
This is a pretty pathetic-looking list, isn’t it? The chances are very 
good that the cost of your funeral is going to be borne by you or 
your estate.
It’s Your Funeral
What kind of funeral arrangements do you want? If you want to go 
the whole nine yards — the visitation with casket open or closed; 
the flowers; the religious service in a funeral chapel or in your 
church, synagogue, or mosque; the graveside service — then you 
probably need the assistance of a funeral home.
If you just want to go straight from your place of death to a cem-
etery or crematorium (this is called “direct disposition” in the 
funeral industry — try to remember not to call it “direct deposit”) 
you may prefer to deal with a transfer service. If no transfer service 
is available in your area, a funeral home can perform the same 
function. If you still want a religious service even though your 
body won’t be present, you can have a memorial service rather 
than a funeral service.
 
If you do any funeral planning, even if it’s only choosing your 
favourite hymn or forbidding flowers you hate, don’t just leave the 
instructions in your will! Wills often aren’t read until the funeral 
is over. Let your family and executor know about your wishes in 
some other way.
Selecting a funeral home
What exactly is a funeral home going to do for you? Well, funeral 
home staff could do all kinds of exciting things. They’ll pick up 
your body, refrigerate it, embalm it if you ask them to (or, quite 
possibly, unless you specifically tell them not to), wash you, make 
up your face (love that orange foundation) or even do restorative 
surgery (this seems like a good place to draw the line and insist on 
a closed coffin), and dress you. Well, at least you’re dead when all 
of this is going on.
They’ll sell you the coffin; rent you a visitation room and the 
funeral chapel; provide a book for visitors to sign; make arrange-
ments for a service in the chapel including clergy, flowers, music, 
and an order of service; get you some pallbearers and ushers; orga-
nize the details of burial or cremation; rent out a hearse and some 
limos; arrange for a police escort so your funeral procession can 
go through red lights and snarl up traffic for kilometres; and cater 
a reception for the mourners. And there’s more. (These people 
are all-rounders.) They’ll deal with the paperwork to get the death

certificate and burial or cremation permit, put your survivors in 
touch with grief counsellors, and maybe even help your family 
apply for death benefits.
Because a funeral home is not a charity run for your benefit but a 
business run for its own benefit, it’s going to charge to do all this. 
Now, you don’t necessarily need every service they can perform, 
and you can tell the funeral home staff what you want if you’re pre-
arranging. However, the arrangements may come in a package and 
you may find that to get the things you want you may also have 
to take a few things you don’t want. If you insist on picking and 
choosing only what you want, it may add up to more than the cost 
of a package. As we said, this is business.
Well, since it’s business, treat it like business. Comparison shop 
before you buy.
Here’s the game plan for your shopping trip. First, discreetly ask 
around among family, friends, and associates who’ve gone through 
the shopping process recently, either for themselves or another. 
Get some recommendations. And it’s just as important to know 
what funeral home gave them the creeps as it is to know what 
funeral home offered good service at an acceptable price.
Next, call three or four of the funeral homes that have been recom-
mended to you and speak to the staff. Give them a general idea of 
what you’d like in the way of a funeral (for example, a visitation, 
no chapel service, and burial in the local area) and ask them to 
tell you roughly what it would cost. Ask about the price range of 
coffins they have on display and whether a brochure with a wider 
selection is available. Ask them to send you a current price list for 
their goods and services (many provinces require them to make 
a list available at no charge and with no obligation). Inquire if 
they belong to any funeral service associations. If you get the feel-
ing that you’re talking to beings who have just crawled out from 
under a damp rock, cross the funeral home off your list. If they 
seem to be decent people, considering the circumstances, make an 
appointment to visit.
When you pay your visit, look the establishment over generally (is 
this the kind of joint you’d be caught dead in?), view the coffins and 
any brochures, and inquire if they charge a fee if you buy your coffin 
elsewhere. Ask to see their standard pre-planning contract, and 
ask for an explanation of anything in it you don’t understand. If no 
funereal activity is going on there that day, you may even consider 
returning during a visitation to see whether they do a nice job.

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 181
If after making your phone calls and visits you’re still undecided 
about which funeral home to choose, study the information you’ve 
collected from each one, comparing services and prices. If that 
doesn’t help, maybe you should investigate more funeral homes. 
Or you can just say to hell with it and leave funeral arrangements 
up to your executor.
Choosing a coffin
A coffin is one of the more intensely interesting purchases you can 
make when you’re shopping at the funeral home of your choice. 
Just think of the fun of going shopping for your own coffin! How 
about the classic Count Dracula model, with beautiful highly 
polished wood and red satin lining? It might cost quite a bit — a 
deluxe casket can cost several thousand dollars.
But you don’t have to spend thousands on a casket. A basic casket 
costs about $750, and you should be able to find something that 
appeals to your taste and your wallet for somewhere between 
that and several thousand dollars. If you’re looking at caskets in 
a funeral home, ask to see a brochure showing their entire line. 
(Even if you fall in love with a particular model, you don’t have to 
buy it on the spot. It’s not as though you’re going to take your pur-
chase home with you.)
 
In some provinces you’ll be able to find a discount coffin outlet. 
These outlets have a lower mark-up on coffins than funeral homes 
do. Maybe you’ll be able to afford the Dracula model after all! 
There could be a bit of unpleasantness, however, if you’re making 
your funeral arrangements through a funeral home and want to 
buy your coffin from a discount outlet. The funeral home’s nose 
will be put out of joint to start with, and they may want to charge a 
handling fee of up to a couple of hundred dollars for using a coffin 
from outside (some provinces allow them to do this).
 
If your principles or your finances take exception to the spend-
ing of hundreds or thousands of dollars on a casket, you have 
still another option for getting yourself properly buried. Legally 
your body doesn’t have to be put in a casket — all that’s actually 
needed is an enclosed rigid container. Funeral homes and transfer 
services can provide a cardboard container for as little as $125, 
and fancier containers for a few hundred dollars. And if you want a 
flashier look for the funeral, you can rent a casket for the visitation 
or service (for about $1,250) and then be buried in a container.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
182
The funeral services contract
If you decide to pre-plan your funeral, you’ll leave written instruc-
tions with the funeral home about your preferences. You can pre-
plan without pre-paying. If you don’t pre-pay, your executor will 
enter into a contract with the funeral home after your death and 
arrange with your bank to release funds from your estate to cover 
the costs.
If you do pre-pay, you can pay the entire amount up front, or you 
may be able to pay on the instalment plan, or you can buy a life 
insurance policy to cover the amount. (Just because you’re pre-
paying doesn’t mean that the price is guaranteed for the entire 
length of your life, though.) If you make a cash payment, some of 
the money (in some provinces, all of the money) has to be held in 
trust by the funeral home and not used until the services are actu-
ally performed.
Hold the formaldehyde
We thought it was time to indulge your morbid curiosity about embalming. If you’re 
a little bit squeamish, you can skip this sidebar.
Embalming involves draining out all your blood and replacing it with a preserva-
tive fluid such as formaldehyde. Yecch. Remember the smell of formaldehyde 
from high school biology classes? The embalming fluid will keep your buried 
body from decomposing for a certain length of time — not forever, but for anywhere 
from a few months to a few years. How long you’ll look well preserved also depends 
on the local climate (cold and dry are good for your complexion, warm and damp 
are bad) and on the air-tightness of your casket. Your body is not going to decay 
significantly in the few hours or days between your death and burial or cremation 
if it’s kept refrigerated . . . and to be frank, you will already have passed your “Best 
Before” date by the time you reach the funeral home.
So why is embalming fluid on tap at the funeral home? The funeral industry thinks 
people look better embalmed. But professional conservatism could be the answer. 
Embalming dates from the years before widespread refrigeration, specifically to 
the time of the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, when a lot of bodies were being shipped 
home over long distances. It made sense then, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense 
now — unless your body is in fact going to be shipped long distances. Some prov-
inces, U.S. states, and foreign countries require bodies to be embalmed before they 
are shipped by public carrier (airline, railroad, ship, or truck).
Our advice? Just say no to embalming, unless there’s a legal requirement for it. On 
the other hand . . . it will be your last kinky experience on this planet. Maybe you’d 
like to swing one final time.

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 183
 
If you’re pre-paying, a contract should be signed by both you and 
the funeral director, and each of you should keep a copy with 
original signatures (that is, don’t accept a photocopy of the signed 
contract). It should set out
 
✓ What you want (casket model, details of visitation and service, 
and so on)
 
✓ The price
 
✓ Any amount you have already paid
 
✓ When and how any future amounts are to be paid
 
✓ What your rights to cancel the contract are (What if you move 
to another city? What if you’re sick now but you miraculously 
recover? What if scientists unlock the secrets of immortality 
next year?)
 
✓ How much of your pre-paid money and accumulated interest 
will be refunded if you cancel
 
 A number of provinces have a “cooling-off” period of a few 
days to a few months, and if you cancel within this period you 
can get all your money back. If you want to cancel after the 
cooling-off period has ended, most provinces require a funeral 
home to refund the entire amount paid except for an adminis-
tration fee (which can go as high as 12 percent in some prov-
inces), but the rules about interest vary across the country.
 
✓ What will become of any money left over after the funeral (it 
should be returned to your estate and an itemized account of 
what was done and what money was spent should be given to 
your executor)
A word from Canada Revenue
Pre-paying for your funeral may have tax advantages.
 
The pre-planning that you do is considered an eligible funeral arrange-
ment (an EFA to those in the know) if the funeral home has set things 
up in accordance with the requirements of the Income Tax Act. 
Money spent on an eligible funeral arrangement can’t be deducted 
from income on your tax return like an RRSP contribution, but inter-
est earned on the money salted away in the EFA isn’t included in 
your reportable income. It doesn’t even have to be included in your 
estate’s income if it’s used on funeral arrangements.
Now, before you start shouting “YEE-HA! Tax-free income!” keep in 
mind that the income has to stay in an EFA until you die to remain tax-
free, and your money is not going to be invested by the funeral home 
in something that will make you rich — it will be invested as safely as 
possible. In the long run, income from an EFA will probably end up 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
184
being used to offset inflation in the cost of the goods and services 
provided by the funeral home, if you live long enough after plan-
ning your funeral for interest and inflation to have a noticeable 
effect.
The really interesting thing about EFAs is how much you’re allowed 
to put into them. You can contribute up to $15,000 for funeral ser-
vices, up to $20,000 for cemetery services, and up to $35,000 for 
both. Here’s what we think: if you’ve got $35,000, forget the funeral. 
Throw a great party while you’re still around to enjoy it.

If you’re keen on pre-arranging and pre-paying, you might want to 
contact your provincial funeral licensing board to find out more 
about funeral contracts in your province. You can find a list of

At Your Disposal: Earth, 
Air, Fire, or Water?
Earth, air, fire, and water are the four elements that ancient phi-
losophers believed everything was made of. So when it’s time to 
return your body to the elements, which one will you choose? Do 
you want to be buried in the earth or at sea, do you want to be cre-
mated, do you want to be returned to the air?
Burial
If you choose burial in the ground, you have to choose a cemetery.
If your family doesn’t already have a plot, or you haven’t been cast-
ing a longing eye on a memorial garden on your route to work, you 
can contact your place of worship or a funeral home for sugges-
tions about cemeteries. Or look in the Yellow Pages.
And before you ask, the answer is pretty much Yes: you have to be 
buried in a cemetery and not in the backyard or the woods. Even 
in the provinces that don’t specifically say that dead human bodies 
belong only in cemeteries, if you leave instructions to be planted 
outside a cemetery your executor may run into trouble with the 
municipal zoning department, the public health authorities, the 
next-door neighbours, and the tabloid media.

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 185
Although the backyard is free, cemetery fees can be high. You 
have to buy a plot or a tomb (interment rights), the actual burial 
or entombment (interment), and some kind of monument so your 
friends and relations will know where to come and cry over you.
Interment rights
It’s no fun talking about “interment rights.” It’s not even any fun 
talking about “plots.” Let’s talk about graves instead. Graves come 
in different sizes. A “single” adult grave can hold two coffins, 
stacked. A lot contains more than one grave, so a two-grave lot 
could hold four coffins. Your family will be very touched if you go 
out grave shopping for yourself and come back with something for 
everyone.
If you prefer above-ground burial, in some cemeteries you can buy 
a tomb . . . also called a crypt. A tomb holds one or two coffins. If 
you’re expecting company, go for a mausoleum. A family mausoleum 
can hold several coffins, a community mausoleum many more.
You can buy interment rights together with someone else, although 
this may seem like taking togetherness a little far. If you do, you 
and your significant interment other can be joint tenants (except in 
Quebec) or tenants in common. If you buy as joint tenants, when the 
first person dies complete ownership of the interment rights passes 
to the survivor. That means that the survivor has to sign a permis-
sion form to let the deceased be buried. If you buy as tenants in 
common, on the other hand, ownership of the deceased’s interment 
rights pass on death to the deceased’s estate, while the surviving 
tenant in common simply goes on having his or her interment rights. 
That means that the estate of the deceased plus the surviving tenant 
in common have to give permission to let the deceased be buried. If 
you buy interment rights all by yourself, only your estate has to give 
permission for you to be buried. Interment rights in a really nice 
cemetery can cost over $5,000. But you can find a Boot Hill for a lot 
less than that.
Interment, or the yawning grave
Interment isn’t that complicated if you’ve chosen a tomb, but if 
you’ve gone for a grave, interment involves locating the boundar-
ies of the grave, digging the grave, placing the coffin in the grave, 
and filling in the grave. A cemetery may charge several hundred 
dollars to do all this.
The monument
Now for the final touch, your monument. The cemetery may have 
bylaws about the size and shape of your monument, but the choice 
generally comes down to an upright stone (yes, you can even have 

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
186
weeping angels on top of it if that’s what you want) or a marker, 
which is a granite or bronze plaque set flush with the ground. In 
some cemeteries you can have a memorial tree planted instead of 
having a monument.
You want your monument to look nice, because that’s all anyone 
is going to see of you once you’re in the ground. And you’re going 
to have to pay for nice. You may spend several hundred dollars for 
a marker, and a thousand dollars and more for an upright granite 
stone. You may be able to (or even required to) arrange for a mon-
ument through the cemetery, or you may have to puddle off to the 
monument maker on your own.
Extras
It’s the little details that will make everyone remember your inter-
ment as a very special one. So you may want
 
✓ The excavated earth removed from the gravesite before the 
committal service starts.
 
✓ Artificial grass and coco matting placed at the gravesite 
during the service.
 
✓ A tent set up for the service.
You will almost certainly also want
 
✓ The gravesite levelled, tamped down, re-graded, and sodded 
after the burial.
 
✓ The gravesite levelled and resodded after the earth settles.
The cemetery will probably charge to do all of these things over 
and above the cost of the interment rights. They will probably also 
charge you extra for
 
✓ Interring the coffin at the deeper level so that a second coffin 
can be stacked above it later.
 
✓ Providing a concrete or steel outer container (a few hundred 
dollars) to prevent the earth from falling in as the casket 
decays (these are not required by provincial law but some 
cemeteries require them).
 
✓ Placing the container in the grave.
 
✓ Holding the funeral later in the day (“later” is usually after 3 
or 4 p.m.) or on a weekend.
 
✓ Administering (determining ownership of the interment rights 
and getting permission for interment, filling out provincial 
documentation, maintaining the cemetery’s files).

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 187
You’ve spent a bundle and it’s just got you buried. What if you’d 
like your grave or tomb to look nice for a few years — at least until 
no one can be bothered visiting you? Probably the first thing to 
do is check the financial health of the organization that runs the 
cemetery. Cemeteries run commercially are required by law in 
most provinces to put aside money for continuing care (cutting 
the grass, re-grading the earth, removing the snow from a road 
through the grounds), but cemeteries run by religious organiza-
tions or municipalities usually are not. If your cemetery has money 
trouble, that means weeds and maybe worse in your earthly future.
That little problem aside, many cemeteries allow arrangements 
to be made for extra care of a grave, such as planting, caring for 
plants, and trimming the grass, either through an endowment (a 
lump sum of money given to the cemetery and earmarked for your 
grave) or through regular payments under a contract with the 
cemetery. An endowment for continuing care could be an eligible 
funeral arrangement (see “A word from Canada Revenue” earlier in 
this chapter).
The contract
When you make cemetery arrangements, you’ll want a contract in 
writing with the cemetery. It should
 
✓ Set out what you’re buying.
 
✓ Set out the price and any amount you’ve already paid.
 
✓ Describe when and how any additional amounts are to be paid.
 
✓ Set out your right to cancel, or your right to have the cem-
etery buy back your interment rights. Although a grave is 
land, many provinces won’t let you do a real estate flip — you 
won’t be able to sell your plot to anyone else. Check that the 
contract or the cemetery bylaws require the cemetery to buy 
your interment rights back (before you use them, of course) if 
you ask. There may be a fee for a buy-back.
 
✓ Have the bylaws of the cemetery attached to it. They govern 
things like the hours the cemetery is open, what can and can’t 
be left at a gravesite, and whether pets are allowed to visit.
Burial at sea
There used to be very practical reasons for burying people at 
sea — namely that they died at sea and in pre-refrigeration days 
nobody wanted them hanging around until landfall was reached. 
Nowadays, if you die at sea the authorities in the ship’s next port 
of call will want to see your remains, so your body will be cooled 
somewhere instead of being chucked over the side.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
188
If you’re an old salt, or you’re just crazy about the ocean, it’s still 
possible to be buried at sea, whether you died at sea or on land. 
It’s possible but it’s far from easy. After you read the rules we tell 
you about below, you’ll probably give up the burial at sea idea just 
like everybody else who found out about the rules.
Burial at sea comes under the jurisdiction of the federal govern-
ment (Environment Canada). And in a word, they would just as 
soon people were buried elsewhere. To encourage people to do 
exactly that, they require
 
✓ A permit for the funeral home or funeral association through 
which you’re arranging the burial at sea. This permit costs 
about $2,500 . . . although it’s good for an entire year and can 
be re-used by the home or association. Before the permit will 
be issued, a notice of intent to bury a body at sea must be 
published in a local newspaper and the deceased’s doctor has 
to certify that the body is free from infection. It takes about 
eight weeks to process the application for the permit.
 
✓ No embalming. You’re going to have to plan ahead very care-
fully to get around this rule. If no one applies for the permit 
until you’re dead, it will be difficult to find a funeral home 
that will keep your body for several weeks in an unembalmed 
state. And if you keel over somewhere other than at the 
ocean’s edge, keep in mind that a body usually has to be 
embalmed before a public carrier will transport it anywhere.
 
✓ A coffin for the body. It has to be designed not to release the 
body and weighted to keep it on the bottom.
 
✓ A site that isn’t being trawled by fishing boats, or dredged, or 
washed by currents that will move the coffin elsewhere. This 
site, in addition, should be at least three nautical miles from 
land and in water at least 200 metres deep.
Now let’s just suppose that you’ve said, “Yup, can do” to all four 
of these conditions. Then you have to go out and find a funeral 
home that’s willing to arrange your burial at sea. That’s hard to 
do because they’ll worry about being sued by your family if your 
coffin gets fished up by a trawler some day, even though you think 
you found the perfect site.
So . . . Environment Canada has an alternative to suggest. Have 
the body cremated and scatter the ashes at sea. No permission 
required, no fee payable. By the way, you can also have your ashes 
scattered on a lake without permission, unless the lake is privately 
owned, or on a river.

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 189
Cremation
Cremation is becoming more popular than burial. Before a body is 
cremated, the provincial coroner’s office has to be satisfied that 
there’s nothing funny about the death — if questions about the 
death arise later on, there won’t be any body to exhume and exam-
ine. So the coroner has to issue a certificate, and there’s usually a 
required waiting period of 48 hours. If the coroner refuses to issue 
a certificate, there can’t be a cremation.
Let’s assume, however, that you won’t die of strychnine poisoning 
at the hands of your family and that your cremation can go ahead. 
Read “Ready, aim . . . fire!” for a brief description of the cremation 
process. As with embalming, the squeamish may want to look away.
If you choose cremation, you may want to think twice about buying 
a fancy casket, because the casket is just going to go up in flames. 
You may prefer to opt for the cardboard container.
How much will you get burned for?
The actual cremation costs a few hundred dollars, but then you 
start running into additional charges for administration, documen-
tation, transfer of the body, witnessing of the cremation process 
(on request), a temporary urn, and shipping of the ashes. Once 
you add everything up, cremation is usually less expensive than 
burial, but it’s still not exactly free.
Ashes to dust
Your ashes, sometimes referred to as cremains but not by us or 
anyone we would invite to dinner, are now your family’s to do with 
what they like. Better give them some hints about what you’d like. 
Not that you’ll have any way of enforcing your wishes, of course, 
except perhaps through haunting. Your options include
 
✓ Being kept in an urn (or a cookie jar or a tackle box or what-
ever pleases you) at home.
 
✓ Being buried in your urn (or whatever) in a casket burial plot 
or a cremation burial plot (less expensive than a casket burial 
plot but still up to several hundred dollars), with or without a 
monument.
 
✓ Being deposited in your urn in a cemetery’s columbarium, 
which is a bunch of niches in a wall. A columbarium is usually 
more expensive than a cremation burial plot — it could cost a 
thousand dollars or more. You can usually have a marker for 
your niche.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
190
 
✓ Being scattered in a cemetery, usually for a fee of a hundred 
dollars or more.
 
✓ Being scattered on private property with the owner’s permis-
sion or on public property (Crown land) without permission. 
However, some municipalities have bylaws against scattering 
remains on private property.
Air
Bet you’re all agog to know what we’ve come up with here, since 
you probably can’t think, off-hand, of a way of disposing of your 
body in air. Some cultures traditionally exposed the bodies of their 
dead to the air and allowed scavenger birds or animals to strip 
off the flesh . . . but that’s not actually what we had in mind, and 
municipal bylaws in Canada tend to frown on that kind of thing 
anyway. Besides, while it’s romantic to imagine eagles and falcons 
returning your body to the air, what you’d probably get in reality 
would be raccoons.
No, what we had in mind was — launching your ashes into space! 
True, space is a vacuum, so there’s no air there, but there might be 
the odd molecule of oxygen whirling by. Anyway, here’s the deal. 
A Texas company called Celestis (www.celestis.com) will, for a 
fee, launch seven grams of your ashes into space in its own little 
container on board a rocket. You can choose among earth-orbit, 
lunar orbit or impact, and a cruise through the solar system and 
out. If this sounds vaguely familiar to you, it’s because you heard 
about the ashes of Gene Roddenberry and Timothy Leary being 
blasted into space on the first Celestis flight in 1997. The least 
expensive option, which launches the spacecraft (and one gram of 
your ashes) into space and then returns them to Earth, costs about 
$700. Earth-orbit costs several thousand dollars, and the other two 
options cost more than twice as much. But it may be just perfect 
for you. To the moon, Alice!
Ready, aim . . . fire!
In cremation, the body, minus any medical devices such as a pacemaker or other 
implant or prosthesis that could explode, is put inside its casket or container into a 
small furnace (the cremation chamber). The temperature in the furnace is raised to 
about 1000°C. After about an hour and a half, the body’s soft tissues (the flesh and 
organs) and the container or casket have been consumed by fire — all that’s left 
is bone fragments. The fragments are pulverized to ash and put into a container. 
The container will weigh about two to four kilos. If you think that sounds heavy, 
remember we’re talking about bone ashes, not wood ashes.

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 191
The Gift That Keeps on Giving: 
Organ and Body Donation
Body part donation is probably another subject that the squea-
mish would prefer to avoid. Unfortunately, most Canadians prefer 
to avoid it, with the result that Canada has one of the lowest organ-
donation rates of all Western nations. Agreeing to donate your 
organs could save someone’s life, and agreeing to donate tissue or 
bone could dramatically improve the quality of someone’s life . . . 
so make yourself think about it. You can have a stiff drink first.
Donation of your entire body is a horse of another colour. Your 
body will probably be used by anatomy students for practice. If 
you’re heavily into this donation thing, be warned that you have 
to make a choice between organ donation and body donation. 
Anatomy students don’t want a body with important bits missing 
from it.
Consenting to body part donation
Provincial law allows an adult to give lasting consent to donation 
of organs and other body parts — “lasting” in the sense that it con-
tinues after death. You can give this consent by joining a provincial 
organ donor registry, or by signing or putting a sticker on the back 
of your provincial health card or your driver’s license (depending 
on your province) or by specifying it in a living will. We tell you 
more about living wills in Chapter 15.
You can agree to donate not only your organs (heart, liver, lungs, 
pancreas, kidneys) but other bits of you as well (heart valves, 
cornea, tissues, bones, skin, tendons and ligaments, bone marrow). 
You can be quite specific about which bits you want to donate and 
which bits you want to keep.
If you don’t give your consent while you’re alive to organ donation, 
your family can be asked after your death (by hospital personnel) 
for their consent. So if you don’t really mind donating but you 
can’t quite bring yourself to sign the donor card, you might men-
tion to your family that they can give permission when you’re 
dead. Generally speaking you’ll stay intact unless you or your 
family consents to donation. If you’re serious about organ dona-
tion, you should sign up with an organ transplant registry if there’s 
one in your province. For example, you could contact the British 
Columbia Transplant Society or the Ontario Ministry of Health: 
Organ Donations. If you want to donate bone marrow, you should 
register with Canadian Blood Services.

Part III: Creating an Estate Plan  
192
Reviewing organ donation eligibility
Let’s not beat around the bush. We’re all agreed that we want to 
be completely dead, and not just enjoying a satisfyingly deep nap, 
before anyone starts removing pieces of us.
If you’re donating something other than organs, you don’t have to 
lose a moment’s sleep over the question of complete deadness. 
But you may wonder a bit about being an organ donor, because 
someone who has undergone “total brain death” can be an organ 
donor. Then you start thinking about degrees of deadness and 
asking yourself whether totally brain-dead is as dead as you would 
like to be when donating a kidney. After all, some of us consider 
total brain death to be our normal state on weekdays from 9 to 5.
So here’s the story on organ donation and total brain death. Organ 
donors are an elite group. They are people who have suffered 
brain damage in an accident or from a stroke or aneurysm and who 
are in a hospital on equipment that keeps oxygenated blood flow-
ing to their organs. (Once blood stops circulating the organs suffer 
damage and are no longer usable — they can’t be jump-started in 
a new body.) As you can see, only a very small number of people 
are eligible to donate organs, so chances are you’ll never be called 
upon anyway.
But supposing you do suffer brain damage. When are you brain-
dead even though your circulation system is still going? If you’re 
permanently unconscious (either in a coma or a persistent vegeta-
tive state) you’re not totally brain-dead. You’ve only undergone 
“cerebral brain death,” because your brain stem is still alive even 
though your higher brain functions (thinking, seeing, hearing) have 
stopped. Your brain stem controls basic body functions like respi-
ration and circulation. You’re not totally brain-dead until the brain 
stem stops too. Then there is no independent respiration or cir-
culation and you have to be put on equipment to keep your lungs 
working and your heart beating.
Now who gets to decide when you’re brain-dead? This seems like 
an important question. The decider shouldn’t be, for example, the 
guy who needs a new pancreas, or the mother of a kid who needs 
a heart transplant. Let us reassure you that nobody who stands to 
gain anything from your organ donation is allowed to be the one 
who says that you’re gone, deceased, and defunct. By provincial 
law, the decision is made by two doctors who have no conflict of 
interest in declaring you brain-dead. Specifically, neither of the 
doctors can be closely associated with a person who will receive 
your organs. In addition, no doctor who plays a role in deciding 
whether you’re totally brain-dead can participate in any way in 
transplanting your organs.

 Chapter 11: Plan Your Funeral and Organ Donation 193
Donating your body
Medical schools and research institutions may accept donations of 
bodies for training students in anatomy and for research purposes. 
Contact the institution of your choice to see if they’re accepting 
bodies. They may not be — they may already have all they want.
It is sad but true that certain people wish to donate their entire 
body to science not for love of humankind but in order to avoid 
paying for burial or cremation. The institution will bury or cremate 
your body at its own expense after its students or researchers are 
finished with you. On the other hand, the institution may ask that 
your estate or family pay the cost of transporting you to the insti-
tution in the first place.

f you don’t have a will, you have no way of putting your estate 
plan into action. In fact, if you don’t have a will, your estate 
could be in a real mess.
A person who dies without a will is said to have died intestate. You 
can die intestate by never making a will at all, or by making a will 
that turns out to be invalid (because you are not legally capable 
of making a will or because your will is not properly signed and 
witnessed — see Chapter 13 for more details).
In this chapter we walk you through the rubble that will be your 
estate if you die with no will.
Investigating Where Your Property 
Will Go if You Die without a Will
If you don’t have a will, your property doesn’t just vanish when 
you die, and it doesn’t get taken away from your family. Every 
province has a statute that sets out rules about how the property 
of an intestate person’s estate will be given away. The rules are dif-
ferent in each province.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
198
If you’re married
In every province, if you leave a spouse and no children or other 
relatives, your spouse will get your entire estate. If you leave a 
spouse and you leave surviving parents, brothers, and sisters, 
or nieces or nephews too, your spouse will still get everything 
(except in Quebec, where these relatives will also get a share of 
the estate).
 
In many provinces only a legally married spouse is entitled to 
receive a share of the estate of an intestate person. So if you think 
of yourself as being “married” to someone but are not legally mar-
ried to that person, he or she may have no right to a share of your 
estate.
If you’re married with children
If you have both a spouse and children when you die intestate, 
your estate will be divided among your spouse and your children. 
(Again, in some provinces, a spouse means a legally married 
spouse.)
 
In some provinces the spouse gets a larger share than the children 
and in other provinces the children get the larger share. In some prov-
inces the spouse gets a fixed amount (sometimes called a preferential 
share) and then whatever’s left is divided among the spouse (again) 
and the children per stirpes — a Latin expression that means “through 
the descendants.” It means if one of your children dies before you, 
your deceased child’s children will get their parent’s share, divided 
up among them. (The other way to distribute if one of your children 
has died is to have your other children take over the deceased child’s 
share. It has a fancy Latin name too — per capita, meaning “by the 
heads.”)
In some provinces, the spouse may be entitled to receive the 
family home instead of, or as part of, the preferential share. In 
other provinces the spouse may be entitled to receive an interest 
in the family home in addition to the preferential share.
Some provinces also have family law statutes that may affect the 
size of your spouse’s share of your estate. Your spouse may be 
able to choose to take the share offered under the family law stat-
ute instead of under the intestacy statute, if it will mean that he or 
she gets a larger share of your estate.

 Chapter 12: If There’s No Will There’s No Way: Why You Need a Will 199
If you’re not married but 
you have children
If you leave children but no spouse — because your spouse is dead 
or you’re divorced — when you die intestate, your estate will be 
divided equally among your children. If one of your children dies 
before you, his or her share will be divided among his or her chil-
dren. In some provinces a partner who is not legally married to 
you will get nothing from your estate at all.
If you’re not married and 
you have no children
If you have no (living, legally still-married-to-you) spouse and no chil-
dren when you die without a will, your estate will go to your other 
relatives. In the following order (in almost all provinces) it will go
 
✓ To your parents if they’re alive, or to your surviving parent if 
one is dead.
 
✓ To your brothers and sisters if both your parents are dead. If 
any of your brothers and sisters are dead, their share will be 
divided among their children, your nieces and nephews (this 
is a per stirpes distribution to your brothers and sisters, if you 
were wondering).
 
✓ To other more distant relatives such as grandparents, aunts, 
uncles, and cousins, if you have no brothers or sisters or 
nieces and nephews.
 
✓ To the provincial government, if you have none of the relatives 
listed above. (The legal term for “goes to the government” is 
escheats.)
If you don’t want this 
to happen to you . . .
Think about what will happen to your property if you die without 
a will. Is it headed where you want it to go? The odds are that pro-
vincial legislation won’t accomplish the same distribution of your 
property that your own will would. Consider these questions:
 
✓ Do you have a spouse and young children?
 
  Many people in that situation want their entire estate to go to 
their spouse, trusting him or her to know best how to handle 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
200
family finances. Even if your children are grown up, you may 
prefer your estate to take care of your spouse first. But if you 
die without a will, your spouse may receive as little as one-
third of your entire estate, depending on your province, and 
your children will receive the rest. (And if your children are 
minors, their share will be managed by the provincial govern-
ment rather than by their surviving parent.)
 
✓ Do you have a partner to whom you’re not legally married?
 
 In some provinces, if you’re not legally married to your partner 
he or she will not automatically receive a share of your estate, 
and may only be able to make a claim against your estate as a 
dependant.
 
✓ Are you separated but not yet divorced?
 
 If you’re still legally married, in most provinces your estranged 
spouse will be entitled to a large share, perhaps all, of your 
estate. Ouch, that hurts!
 
✓ Do you have friends you’d like to leave something to?
 
  Friends aren’t mentioned anywhere in the provincial statutes.
 
✓ Were you thinking of leaving something to charity?
 
 Charities don’t figure in the provincial law either.
Finding Out Who Will Administer 
Your Estate
If you die without a will, the court will have to appoint someone 
to act as administrator of your estate, and no one has authority 
to start dealing with your estate until the formal appointment is 
made. That means no one can do necessary things like protect-
ing the property of your estate, gathering it in, investing the cash, 
paying debts, and so on.
 
The court will take an application from anyone who wants the job of 
administering your estate, and if it decides to appoint that person, it 
will issue a formal document naming the administrator. This docu-
ment is called letters of administration in most provinces, although in 
Ontario they managed to come up with the light and charming name 
certificate of appointment of estate trustee without a will. The letters 
of administration are proof of the administrator’s legal authority to 
administer your estate. They take the place of the letters probate 
that an executor has for proof of his or her authority.

 Chapter 12: If There’s No Will There’s No Way: Why You Need a Will 201
How will an administrator 
be found?
The provincial government first looks for volunteers if your estate 
needs an administrator. Any person who is entitled to receive a 
share of your estate may apply to be the administrator, although 
in many provinces the administrator has to reside within the 
province.
If more than one person wants the position, the provincial intes-
tacy statute sets out who has the better right to be administrator. 
Usually, the closest relative who applies will be appointed, with 
your spouse (if you have one) having the best right. The court 
has the power to appoint two or more people to act as joint 
administrators.
If no one who’s going to get something from your estate wants to 
volunteer, then the beneficiary or beneficiaries who will receive 
the biggest share of your property can agree to the appointment of 
a non-beneficiary as administrator.
 
Even if only one person applies to be administrator, the applica-
tion may take several weeks to make its way through the court 
process. If more than one person applies and there’s a contest 
between them, a court hearing will usually be required. If you have 
no relatives and therefore no beneficiaries approved by the provin-
cial statute, then a provincial government official will administer 
your estate. But that’s okay, because the government is getting all 
of your property anyway.
The application for letters 
of administration
The person who wants to be the administrator of your estate has 
to apply to the court for letters of administration, and notify all 
of your beneficiaries (as determined by your provincial intestacy 
statute) about his or her application. He or she has to provide 
various pieces of paper to the court, including a sworn statement 
that he or she is closely enough related to you to have the right to 
be your administrator. The applicant will also have to get all the 
other relatives with an equal or greater right to be administrator to 
consent in writing to his or her appointment. If the applicant can’t 
get that consent, he or she can substitute a written statement from 
each of them that they do not wish to act as administrator.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
202
After the court has appointed the administrator, he or she will 
probably have to post security with the court (hand over valuable 
property like money or a bond — an iron-clad promise to pay 
money — to the court) before being allowed to set to work. The 
purpose of making the administrator post security is to discour-
age the administrator from stealing from your estate or engaging 
in other questionable activities. The administrator will get the 
security back after the estate has been distributed — if he has kept 
his nose clean throughout the process. The administrator may not 
have to post security if all of the beneficiaries and all of the credi-
tors of your estate agree in writing that it’s not necessary.
Understanding the Difficulties That 
Will Arise in the Administration 
of Your Estate
You’ve already caused a lot of trouble for everyone simply by not 
having an executor. But even after you’ve got the administrator, 
the problems keep coming.
A stranglehold on the administrator
Provincial law defines an administrator’s powers and duties in 
managing your estate. An administrator, by law, does somewhat 
different things with your estate than an executor would do. This 
can have a really big effect on your estate.
Converting property to cash
The general rule is that your administrator has to sell all of the 
non-cash property of your estate (rather than just enough to pay 
your debts) in order to turn your whole estate into cash, unless 
all of your beneficiaries agree otherwise. (In some provinces, real 
estate is treated differently. Unless it must be sold to pay the debts 
of your estate, a majority of the beneficiaries must agree before it 
can be sold.)
If your administrator has to sell property in your estate, he can’t 
decide when’s the best time to sell in order to get the best price. 
He has to do it as soon as possible after becoming administrator.

 Chapter 12: If There’s No Will There’s No Way: Why You Need a Will 203
Investing the cash
Until the cash is distributed to the beneficiaries, your administra-
tor must keep it invested as provided for by statute — in all prov-
inces in any kind of property in which a prudent investor might 
invest. Your administrator will not be able to invest your estate 
in anything risky — even if it’s an investment you owned when 
you died!
Distributing your estate
After debts and taxes are paid, your administrator must distribute 
your estate to the beneficiaries named in the provincial statute. 
Even if your beneficiaries agreed that your administrator didn’t 
have to sell everything in your estate for cash, your administrator 
has no authority to give beneficiaries specific pieces of property 
unless (again) all of the beneficiaries agree. If your beneficiaries 
can’t agree on which individual pieces of property can be given to 
which beneficiaries, your administrator will have to sell everything 
and just give the beneficiaries cash. If you would have liked to give 
certain items to particular people, those people — even if they’re 
beneficiaries under the statute — may never get them.
Increased taxes
Your estate will probably end up paying more in taxes if your 
property is distributed without a will. Without a will, it is hard to 
take full advantage of the tax planning strategies we tell you about 
in the following sections.
The spousal rollover
When you die you are deemed to dispose of all of your capital 
property (property with a long-term value, like real estate or shares 
in a corporation) at its fair market value. If your property has gone 
up in value since you got it, there will be a capital gain and your 
estate will have to pay tax on one-half of the capital gain.
Property that you leave to your spouse is an exception. If you leave 
capital property to your spouse, it’s called a spousal rollover, 
and you are deemed to dispose of the property for the same cost 
at which you acquired it. As a result there will be no capital gain 
when you die. The capital gain is put off until your spouse disposes 
of the property. Then, your spouse’s capital gain is calculated as if 
he or she got the property at the same cost you got it for. (We also 
talk about spousal rollovers in Chapter 3.)

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
204
If you don’t have a valid will, you don’t lose the benefit of the spou-
sal rollover entirely. No capital gains tax will be payable on the 
part of your estate that is paid to your spouse under the provincial 
intestacy laws. But if you have children (in Quebec if you have 
children or surviving parents, brother and sisters, and nieces and 
nephews), your entire estate will not be paid to your spouse. Your 
spouse may receive as little as one-third of your estate. And if capi-
tal property in your estate has increased in value, your estate will 
have to pay capital gains tax on the share of the estate that goes to 
anyone other than your spouse.
If you have a spouse and children and want them to share your 
estate — even if you like the provincial rules about how your 
estate is divided among them — it’s best to make a will, for tax 
planning purposes. When you have the choice, you leave your 
spouse property that has larger capital gains and your children 
property that has smaller capital gains or no capital gain at all 
(such as your principal residence). Then your estate is able to take 
full advantage of the spousal rollover to pay the least tax possible.
The principal residence exemption
If you dispose of your principal residence and make some money, 
that profit is normally not subject to capital gains tax. (That’s 
true whether you’re alive and just selling the place, or you “dis-
posed” of it at the time of your death. See Chapter 3.) But tax law 
allows you to have only one principal residence. If you own more 
than one residence, when you dispose of one of them you have to 
choose which of your residences is your principal residence.
If you don’t have a will, your administrator still gets to choose 
which residence is your principal residence at the time of your 
death (if you hadn’t made a designation while you were alive). But 
you lose the chance to take full advantage of the principal resi-
dence exemption by leaving one residence to your spouse (without 
capital gains tax because of the spousal rollover) and the other 
residence to someone other than your spouse (without capital 
gains tax because you designate it as your principal residence).
RRSPs and RRIFs
When you die, all of your RRSPs and RRIFs are deemed to be 
cashed in. The full amount of the RRSPs and RRIFs will be added to 
your income and taxed along with your other income and capital 
gains in your terminal return.
This rule has an exception if you name your spouse as beneficiary 
of your RRSP or RRIF and the proceeds are paid into an RRSP or 
RRIF for your spouse. Then the proceeds are not considered your 

 Chapter 12: If There’s No Will There’s No Way: Why You Need a Will 205
income, and neither your estate nor your spouse pays tax on the 
amount of the proceeds. (Your spouse must pay tax when he or 
she withdraws money from the RRSP or RRIF. See Chapter 3.)
Another exception is if your RRSP or RRIF proceeds are paid to 
your estate and you leave the proceeds in your will to your spouse 
or a dependent child or grandchild (or if you name the child as 
beneficiary of the RRSP or RRIF). In that case, your executor and 
your beneficiary may file a joint form agreeing that the proceeds 
will be considered income of the beneficiary rather than of your 
estate. Your beneficiary can put off paying tax on the proceeds by 
transferring the money into his or her own RRSP or RRIF.
If you don’t have a will and you haven’t named your spouse as ben-
eficiary of your RRSPs or RRIFs, your estate won’t lose the benefit 
of this exception entirely. If the proceeds are used to pay your 
spouse’s share of your estate or the share of a dependent child or 
grandchild, then your estate won’t pay tax on the proceeds.
But your RRSP or RRIF proceeds may not go entirely to your 
spouse or dependent children or grandchildren. If you have chil-
dren (in Quebec, if you have children or surviving parents, broth-
ers and sisters, nieces and nephews) your entire estate will not be 
paid to your spouse. Your other relatives (who may not be depen-
dent children or grandchildren) could get up to two-thirds of your 
estate. If the proceeds are used to pay the shares of these other 
relatives, your estate will pay tax on the proceeds.
Your administrator and your spouse (or other beneficiaries) will 
have to decide whether your RRSP or RRIF or your other property 
are being used to satisfy their share of your estate. Your adminis-
trator may not be able to take full advantage of both the RRSP/RRIF 
tax savings and the spousal rollover.
RRSP contributions for your spouse
You may die without having used your RRSP contribution limit in 
the year of your death. If you die without a will, your administra-
tor can’t take your unused contribution and make a contribution 
to your spouse’s RRSP and, by doing so, reduce the tax payable by 
your estate. If you leave a will, you can authorize your executor to 
make such a contribution to your spouse’s RRSP.
Charitable donations
Your estate is entitled to a donation tax credit for any charitable 
donations you make in the year of your death or in your will. A 
charitable donation in your will can reduce your tax bill signifi-
cantly. (See Chapters 3 and 10.)

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
206
If you do not have a will, your administrator will not have the power 
to make charitable donations on your behalf, even though that 
might have been your wish. So your estate won’t be able to claim 
a charitable donation tax credit in your terminal return, either.
Government meddling
Children under the age of majority cannot receive property from 
an estate themselves. It has to be put into trust for them until 
they come of age. When you make a will, one of the matters you 
take care of is creating a trust (with a trustee that you’ve chosen 
yourself) to hold property for children. (See Chapter 6 for more on 
using trusts.)
If you haven’t left a will, the property of your estate still can’t go 
directly to minor children. It still has to go into a trust. But if you 
die intestate, the trustee will be — depending on your province — 
a public official or a person appointed by the court.
The trustee, whoever it is, will keep the child’s money invested in 
very conservative investments, so it isn’t likely to increase greatly 
in value while it’s in the trust.
The trustee can pay money out of the trust to the person who has 
custody of the child. But the trustee isn’t going to pay anything 
out unless he or she approves of the plan for spending the money 
on the child. The trustee is not necessarily going to feel kindly and 
indulgent towards the child and the child’s guardian when they ask 
for money, because his or her actions are subject to review and 
even audit by other government officials and the court. The trustee 
will turn the property in trust over to the child as soon as the child 
comes of age (at 18 or 19, depending on the province). The kid 
doesn’t even have to come up with a plan for the trustee in order 
to get the money.
Mystery beneficiaries
The more remote beneficiaries named in the provincial intestate 
statute may turn out to be people you didn’t keep in touch with. 
They may even turn out to be people you never met and didn’t know 
existed. Your administrator will have to find them anyway, without 
benefit of your little black address book. The administrator may 
have to question your relatives and friends, advertise in the per-
sonal column of newspapers, or even hire a private investigator.

 Chapter 12: If There’s No Will There’s No Way: Why You Need a Will 207
Recognizing the Benefits 
of Having a Will
To be truthful, having a will isn’t going to make everything perfect 
(for instance, you’re still dead), but it’s a lot better than not having 
a will. Here’s why:
 
✓ Your property will be given away to the people and charities 
you’ve chosen.
 
✓ You can choose an executor — someone you trust to look 
after your estate and do the best job for your family and 
friends. Your executor will be able to start work right away 
after your death.
 
✓ You can give your executor discretion to manage the property 
in your estate — to decide when to sell your property and 
how property in the estate can be invested. You don’t have 
to tell your executor to convert all the property of the estate 
into cash, although you can if you wish. Your executor has to 
convert only enough to pay the debts and taxes of the estate 
and to pay gifts of cash to named beneficiaries. You can tell 
your executor how you want the estate’s property invested, 
and you’ll be able to tell your executor whether to give your 
property to a beneficiary in its current form or make a cash 
payment.
 
✓ You can take advantage of tax planning strategies by carefully 
choosing how your property will be distributed among your 
beneficiaries, by making charitable donations in your will, and 
by directing your executor to make an RRSP contribution on 
behalf of your spouse to use up your unused RRSP contribu-
tion limit. (See Chapter 3.)
 
✓ You can use your will to set up a trust for beneficiaries who 
are under the age of majority. In your will you can give your 
trustee instructions on how to manage your children’s money. 
(See Chapter 6.)
 
✓ You can use your will to name a testamentary guardian for 
your minor children, so they’ll be sure of your wishes for your 
children’s care. (See Chapter 8.)

▶ Looking at how to avoid making mistakes in your will

A
 will is the main document that puts an estate plan into 
action. Unfortunately, reading a standard will prepared by 
a lawyer is like turning onto an unfamiliar country road without a 
map. It’s very easy to get lost!
Looking at the Components 
of a Standard Will
We’re going to take you on a brief tour of the components of a 
standard will so that you won’t find yourself drifting helplessly and 
searching for a familiar landmark when you look for the first time 
(or the tenth time) at your own will.
A standard will can be very short or can go on for pages and pages. 
It is usually at least several pages long and contains a series of 
numbered paragraphs. Although every will is tailored to the needs 
of the individual, wills often follow a standard pattern. You can 
expect to find clauses that
 
✓ Identify the testator, the person making the will (you).
 
✓ Revoke (cancel) all previous wills, to make it clear that this 
will replaces any earlier will you made.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
210
 
✓ Name the executor, the person who will administer your estate.
 
✓ Leave all of your property to your executor in trust to hand 
the property out according to the instructions in your will.
 
✓ Tell the executor to pay all valid debts, claims, and taxes of 
the estate.
 
✓ Tell the executor to give your beneficiaries (people and/or 
charities you’ve chosen to receive gifts) whatever is left in the 
estate after the debts, claims, and taxes have been paid.
 
✓ Give the executor certain legal and financial powers to 
manage your estate — power to keep or sell property in the 
estate, to invest cash, and to borrow money.
 
✓ Name someone to have custody of minor children, if you 
have any.
Translating a Will 
into Plain English
A will isn’t written in plain English. It’s written in a combination 
of English and Latin, with some medieval French thrown in. You’ll 
also notice that it follows the simple rule, “Why use one word 
when three will do?” As well, when it comes to sentence length, 
enough is never enough, and punctuation is almost totally banned 
(especially if it might put a sentence out of its misery).
Wills are written the way they are because this wording has stood 
up to legal challenges for years and years, and lawyers don’t like 
to mess with success. But in this section we take a close look at a 
(fictional) will, and translate it to make it comprehensible in a lan-
guage spoken by normal (non-lawyer) humans.
There is no one-size-fits-all will. Each person’s will has to meet the 
needs and objectives of that particular person. So first we tell you 
something about our imaginary testator, John Robinson, and about 
his wishes.
John Robinson is married to Maureen Robinson. They have a 
grown-up daughter, Judy, and two younger children, Penny and 
Will. And who knows, they might have more children in the future.
John wants to leave his state-of-the-art atomic force microscope 
to his colleague, Dr. Zachary Smith; $10,000 to his daughter Judy; 
and $2,500 to the Alpha Prime Foundation to Save All Humanity 
Resident in Canada (a Canada Revenue–registered charity). He 
wants to leave everything else to his wife if she is still alive when 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 211
he dies. If his wife dies before he does, he wants to divide what’s 
left among his children and wants each minor child’s share of the 
estate to be held in trust until the child is 21 years old.
He wants his wife to be his executor if she is still alive when he 
dies. If his wife dies before he does, he wants his daughter Judy to 
be his executor. He wants his executor to have broad powers to 
deal with his estate and to be able to use her own judgment about 
what to do.
Now that you’ve met John Robinson, you won’t feel too nosy as 
you work your way through his will in the following sections.
 
As you read through John’s will, you may think it’s endless — but 
it could be longer! We leave out some things that a careful lawyer 
would have put in, such as the following:
 
✓ Because John and Maureen are the parents of young children, 
this will should include a paragraph naming someone to have 
custody of their children if both John and Maureen die. We 
have not included the clause because the wording varies from 
province to province.
 
✓ In some provinces, John may want to include language that 
would limit the right of a beneficiary’s spouse to share in the 
property on a breakdown of the beneficiary’s marriage.
 
✓ John may want to give his executor discretion to make an 
RRSP donation on his wife’s behalf, to use up any unused 
RRSP contributions.
 
✓ John may want to direct his trustee to hold onto his home for 
his children until they reach a certain age.
 
✓ If John has a business or complex investments, his will may 
include clauses that give the trustee additional powers spe-
cifically designed to deal with them.
 
✓ John may want to include an insurance trust clause to deal 
with the proceeds of any insurance policies.
Identification
The identification part is easy. It identifies the document as a will 
and the testator as John Robinson. It also identifies his city and 
province of residence.
I, John Robinson, of the City of Metropolis, in the Province 
of Saskatario, DECLARE that this is my Last Will and 
Testament.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
212
Revocation of other wills
The making of a will generally cancels any previous wills. Clause I 
makes it clear that the testator does intend to cancel them as well 
as any codicil, an addition to an existing will that revises some part 
of the will.
I. I REVOKE all Wills and Codicils previously made by me.
Naming the executor
Clause II appoints John’s wife, Maureen, to be his executor. If 
Maureen dies or is unwilling or unable to act as John’s executor or 
to complete the executor’s work, John appoints his daughter Judy 
to be executor.
John named an alternate executor for Maureen (Judy), but has not 
named an alternate executor for Judy. If Maureen dies and then 
Judy dies, Judy’s executor will become John’s executor.
This clause names the executor as both executor and trustee, and 
the executor is referred to as “the Trustee” for the rest of the will. 
That’s because the next clause sets up a trust for all of the prop-
erty in John’s estate and the executor is the trustee who deals with 
the property.
II. I APPOINT my wife, MAUREEN ROBINSON, to be the 
Executor of my Will and Trustee of my estate. If my wife 
shall predecease me or otherwise be unable or unwilling to 
act as Executor of my Will and Trustee of my estate before 
all the trusts set out in my Will have been fully performed, I 
appoint my daughter, JUDY ROBINSON, to be the Executor 
of my Will and Trustee of my estate in her place and stead. 
I DECLARE that the expression “my Trustee” used through-
out my Will shall include the Executor and Trustee for the 
time being, whether original, additional or substitutional.
Leaving property to the 
executor in trust
Clause III gives all of John Robinson’s property to his executor, not 
for her own benefit but for the benefit of the people who will even-
tually receive the property under the will. These are the people to 
whom John’s estate owes money, and the beneficiaries.

 Chapter 13: Will Power 213
 
A “general power of appointment,” in case you were wondering, is 
a very old-fashioned right over property that you rarely find in 
Canada any more.
John’s instructions to his trustee about what to do with the prop-
erty in trust are set out in the lettered sub-paragraphs that follow 
this clause.
III. I give all of my property of every nature and kind 
wherever situate, both real and personal and including 
any property over which I may have a general power of 
appointment, to my Trustee upon the following trusts, 
namely:
Payment of debts
Paragraph (a) directs the executor (now of course known as the 
Trustee) to pay all legitimate (valid) debts, claims, and taxes of 
John Robinson’s estate, including the cost of his funeral. Most of the 
paragraph deals with the different ways that taxes might become 
payable. The executor is given the right (by John, not by Canada 
Revenue) to use her judgment about the timing of tax payments — 
she can put off paying (commute) or pay in advance (prepay).
Payment of debts and taxes is the executor’s first responsibility. 
Nothing can be given to the beneficiaries until it is clear that there 
is enough money in the estate to pay the debts and taxes. If there 
is not enough money to cover them and the full amount of the gifts 
to the beneficiaries, the gifts to the beneficiaries will be reduced.
(a) TO PAY my just debts, funeral and testamentary 
expenses and income taxes, and all estate, legacy, succes-
sion or inheritance duties and taxes whether imposed pursu-
ant to the laws of Saskatario or any other jurisdiction that 
may be payable in connection with any property passing on 
my death (or deemed so to pass) or in connection with any 
proceeds of any insurance and/or annuities on my life or 
any gift or benefit given or conferred by me either in my life-
time or by survivorship or by my Will or any Codicil thereto 
and whether such duties and taxes be payable in respect of 
estates or interests which fall into possession at my death 
or at any subsequent time. All such debts, expenses, duties 
and taxes are to be paid out of and be a charge on firstly the 
personal property and secondly the real property constitut-
ing the residue of my estate. I hereby authorize my Trustee 
in her unfettered discretion to commute or prepay or defer 
the payment of any such duties or taxes.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
214
Distributing the remaining property 
to the beneficiaries
After the executor pays the debts and taxes of John’s estate, she 
must give the remaining property to the beneficiaries according 
to John’s instructions. First she must give the specific gifts John 
made in his will. After the specific gifts are made, she must dis-
tribute the residue. The residue is what is left after debts, claims, 
taxes, and estate administration expenses have been paid and the 
specific gifts have been given out.
Specific gifts
John’s will contains three specific gifts, one of personal property 
and two of cash.
(b) To deliver to ZACHARY SMITH, if he survives me, my 
Atomic Force Microscope.
This gift of property is worded in a typical way. There will be a 
gift only if Zachary Smith is alive when John dies. If Dr. Smith dies 
before John, Smith’s heirs are not entitled to the gift. The micro-
scope will become part of the residue of John’s estate and go to 
other beneficiaries of John’s.
Even though paragraph (b) doesn’t say so, there will also be a gift 
only if John owns a microscope when he dies. If he doesn’t own 
it at the time of his death, Dr. Smith will get nothing since the will 
does not provide for an alternate gift to him.
(c) To pay to my daughter, JUDY ROBINSON, if she survives 
me, the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000), provided 
that if she does not survive me such legacy shall lapse.
This is a typical gift of cash to an individual. There will be a gift 
only if Judy is alive when John dies. If Judy dies before John, the 
gift will lapse and her heirs will not be entitled to take the gift. The 
cash will become part of the residue of John’s estate.
And there will be a gift only if there is $10,000 left in John’s estate 
after his executor pays the estate’s debts and gives Dr. Smith the 
microscope.
(d) To give to the Alpha Prime Foundation to Save All 
Humanity Resident in Canada, located in Ottawa, Ontario, 
Canada, the sum of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars 
($2,500) for its general purposes. The receipt of the trea-
surer or other proper officer of this organization shall be 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 215
a sufficient discharge to my Trustee. Should the aforesaid 
organization not be in existence at my death, I DIRECT my 
Trustee to transfer the sum set aside for such organization 
to such other charitable or community organization as my 
Trustee in her absolute discretion considers to be the suc-
cessor to such organization or to carry on similar works for 
the benefit of a similar group of people.
This is a typical gift of cash to a charity. In the second sentence of 
paragraph (d), John is saying that the executor has done all that 
is expected of her if she gives the money to the charity and gets 
a receipt for it from someone who appears to be an officer of the 
charity. This paragraph is designed to protect the executor from 
liability if the person she pays the money to turns out to be the 
wrong person. If the charity is no longer in existence at the date of 
John’s death, the executor may give the money to a similar charity.
Gift of the residue
John is leaving the residue of his estate (what’s left after payment 
of his debts and taxes and the gifts to Dr. Smith, Judy, and the 
Alpha Prime Foundation) to his wife Maureen. But she gets the 
residue only if she lives for at least 30 days after his death. If she 
dies before John dies or less than 30 days after John dies, she will 
not inherit. Now what’s that all about?
Suppose John and Maureen were in a traffic accident together. 
Without the last words of paragraph (e), Maureen would inherit 
from John even if she outlived him by only 15 minutes. The residue 
of John’s estate would go to Maureen, and then would immedi-
ately become part of Maureen’s estate and would be disposed of 
according to the provisions in her will. So John’s property would 
be given to the people named by Maureen, not by John! Even if 
John and Maureen both name the same beneficiaries (as husbands 
and wives very often do), the property would have to pass through 
first John’s estate and then Maureen’s estate. That would result in 
extra work and expense.
Thirty days is the standard time period used in wills. There’s 
no magic to the number 30 nowadays, but it was probably once 
considered a reasonable length of time to wait to see whether the 
second of two people who were injured or who sickened at the 
same time was going to live or die.
(e) To pay and transfer the residue of my estate to my wife, 
MAUREEN ROBINSON, if she survives me by thirty (30) days.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
216
Alternative gift of the residue
Paragraph (f) says what happens to the residue if Maureen 
Robinson dies before John does or within 30 days after John dies. 
John’s estate is to be divided equally among his children. If Judy, 
Penny, and Will all survive John, and John has no other children by 
that point, then each of the three children will get one-third of the 
residue.
(f) If my wife predeceases me or fails to survive me by 
thirty (30) days, then on the death of the survivor of me 
and my wife (“the Division Date”), to divide the residue 
of my estate into as many equal shares as there shall be 
children of mine then alive, and I declare that if any child 
of mine should then be dead and if any issue of such 
deceased child should then be living, such deceased child 
of mine shall be considered as alive for the purpose of such 
division.
But what happens if a child also dies before John does? When John 
was considering how to pass his estate on to his family, he had 
to think about whether the share of a child who died before him 
would simply go to his surviving children or whether it would go 
to any children that his deceased child had. This paragraph shows 
that John ended up deciding to divide a deceased child’s share 
among that child’s own children.
Here’s an example of how this paragraph might work itself out, 
given the following situation:
 
 John dies, as the result of an unfortunate accident. At the time 
of his death, Maureen is already dead, as is Judy. Penny and 
Will are both in their twenties. Will has a son, Robby. Judy is 
survived by her two daughters, Betsy and Sally.
The residue of John’s estate would be distributed like this:
 
✓ Penny will receive one-third of the residue.
 
✓ Will will receive one-third of the residue (and his son will 
receive nothing).
 
✓ Betsy and Sally will receive Judy’s one-third share and it will 
be split equally between them, so each of John’s granddaugh-
ters will receive one-sixth of the residue.
Trust for children under the age of 21
The rest of paragraph (f), which should not be approached with-
out a stiff scotch, tells John’s executor what to do if any of John’s 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 217
children or grandchildren are under the age of majority (18 or 
19, depending on the province) when John dies. Remember that 
a minor child cannot receive property directly. In Canada, if no 
trustee is named, then the provincial public trustee is supposed to 
look after a minor child’s inheritance.
John instructs that the share of any minor child (or grandchild), 
including any interest earned on the share, is to be held in a trust 
set up specifically for the child, with John’s executor as trustee. 
The share, plus interest, is to be turned over to the child when 
he or she turns 21. John could have instructed his executor to 
turn over the child’s share as soon as the child reached the age of 
majority. However, he thought that any child would be better able 
to handle the inheritance at a slightly older age.
Until the child turns 21, John instructs his executor to use her own 
judgment about how much of the money to give to or spend on the 
child.
Finally, if a child dies before reaching the age of 21, that child’s 
share will be divided among his or her children, if any. If the child 
has no children, then his or her share will be divided among John’s 
other surviving children. If one of John’s children has died (under 
21) but has produced children, then the share that would have 
gone to John’s child will be divided among those children. If you’re 
wondering where we’re getting all of this from . . . because frankly 
you don’t see it there . . . part of what we’ve said is an expansion 
of the two little words “per stirpes,” a Latin phrase that means 
“through the descendants.”
(f) continued My Trustee shall set aside one of such equal 
shares as a separate trust for each child of mine who shall 
be living at the Division Date and shall keep such share 
invested and the income and capital or so much thereof as 
my Trustee in her uncontrolled discretion considers advis-
able shall be paid to or applied to the benefit of such child 
until he or she attains the age of twenty-one years when the 
capital of such share or the amount thereof remaining shall 
be paid or transferred to him or her, any income not so 
paid or applied in any year to be added to the capital and 
dealt with as part thereof. If such child should die before 
attaining the age of twenty-one years, such share, or the 
amount thereof remaining, shall be held by my Trustee in 
trust for the issue of such child who survive him or her in 
equal shares per stirpes. If such child should leave no issue 
him or her surviving, such share or the amount thereof 
remaining shall be held by my Trustee in trust for my issue 
alive at the death of such child in equal shares per stirpes.

218
Executor’s powers
From this point on, a will mainly natters about giving the executor 
powers to deal with the estate. These include such things as the 
power to keep property of the estate in its current form instead of 
turning it into cash, the power to invest the estate’s cash as the 
executor thinks best, the power to borrow money on behalf of the 
estate, and the power to buy property from the estate.
Turning the estate’s property into cash
In clause IV, John gives his executor the power to keep any of the 
property of the estate in the form it’s in when John dies, instead 
of selling it for cash. He also gives her the power to delay turning 
property of the estate into cash. Under provincial law, an executor 
must turn all of the property of the estate into cash as quickly as 
possible — unless the will contains the powers given here.
IV. I AUTHORIZE my Trustee to use her unfettered discre-
tion in the realization of my estate. My Trustee shall have 
the power to sell or otherwise convert into money any 
part of my estate not consisting of money at such time and 
upon whatever terms my Trustee shall decide, with power 
and discretion to decide against such conversion with all 
or any part of my estate or to postpone the conversion of 
my estate or any part thereof for any length of time as she 
may think best. I authorize and empower my Trustee to 
retain any portion of my estate in the form in which it may 
be at my death (whether it is in the form of investments in 
which trustees are by law authorized to invest trust funds 
and whether there may be any liability attached thereto) 
for any length of time that my Trustee considers to be in 
the best interests of my estate, and I also declare that no 
property not in fact producing income shall be treated as 
producing income.
Aren’t those run-on sentences great?
Investments
In clause V, John gives his executor very broad powers to decide 
how to invest any cash in the estate by allowing her to invest in 
any type of investment she thinks will be good. John also gives his 
executor absolution: As long as she makes her investment deci-
sions honestly, she won’t be financially responsible to the benefi-
ciaries if any of the investments lose money.

 Chapter 13: Will Power 219
V. I DECLARE that my Trustee when making investments 
for my estate shall not be limited to investments autho-
rized by law for trustees but may make any investments 
which in her absolute discretion she considers advisable, 
and my Trustee shall not be liable for any loss that may 
happen to my estate in connection with any such invest-
ment made by her in good faith.
Distribution in kind
If it turns out that more than one beneficiary will share in the 
residue of the estate (which will happen if Maureen dies before or 
within 30 days of John’s death), John’s executor will have to divide 
the residue of the estate into the correct number of shares. Under 
this will, the shares have to be of equal value (we’re getting this 
from paragraph III(f)).
VI. MY TRUSTEE may make any division of my estate or set 
aside or pay any share or interest therein, either wholly or 
in part, in the assets forming my estate at the time of my 
death or at the time of such division, setting aside or pay-
ment, and I expressly declare that my Trustee shall in her 
absolute discretion fix the value of my estate or any part 
thereof for the purpose of making any such division, setting 
aside or payment, and her decision shall be final and bind-
ing upon all persons concerned
John’s estate may include some cash (in various currencies), some 
stocks, his residence, vehicle, furniture, art objects, and household 
goods. The only totally fair way to distribute the estate in equal 
shares would be to sell everything and split the cash. But, as with 
most estates, there are items that the beneficiaries would like to 
keep in the family. John, in clause VI, says that the executor can 
use her own judgment in deciding to distribute some, or all, of the 
residue in its existing form. She’ll be able to give each beneficiary 
a combination of cash and other property as long as the value of 
each beneficiary’s share amounts to the correct percentage of the 
total value of the residue. If the beneficiaries can’t agree on the 
value of individual pieces of property, the executor may have to 
get a professional valuation.
Dealing with minors
John’s will contains two more clauses to help his executor deal 
with beneficiaries who are minors.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
220
Clause VII sets up a trust for anyone who may end up inherit-
ing property under John’s will while still a minor, but who is not 
already covered by the trust that looks after John’s children and 
grandchildren. This is the ultimate “what-if” clause because it 
addresses the possibility that when John dies his wife is dead and 
all of his children are dead without having left any grandchildren. 
John has not said where he wants his estate to go if that happens. 
As a result, his estate would be divided under provincial intestacy 
laws and might eventually reach a distant relative under the age of 
majority. If he has no relative, his estate will escheat to the Crown 
(become the property of the provincial government). If the estate 
escheats, this trust clause will be totally unnecessary.
VII. SUBJECT AS herein specifically provided, if any person 
other than a child of mine should become entitled to any 
share in my estate before attaining the age of majority, the 
share of such person shall be held and kept invested by my 
Trustee and the income and capital, or so much thereof as 
my Trustee in her absolute discretion considers advisable, 
shall be used for the benefit of such person until he or she 
attains the age of majority.
Clause VIII talks about the mechanics of making payments on 
behalf of beneficiaries who are minors. Since payments cannot be 
made directly to a minor, this clause gives the executor author-
ity to make the payment to the minor’s parent or guardian or to 
anyone else whom the executor considers suitable (for example, a 
school requiring payment of tuition fees).
VIII. I AUTHORIZE my Trustee to make any payments for 
any person under the age of majority to a parent or guard-
ian of such person or to anyone to whom she in her discre-
tion deems it advisable to make such payments, whose 
receipt shall be a sufficient discharge to my Trustee.
Signing provisions
This final clause says how many pages long the will is. That’s so 
nobody will be able to slip an extra page in after John has signed.
The clause also says the date on which John signed the will. It is 
important to include the date, since a new will revokes all wills that 
John made earlier. Without dates, it will be impossible to know 
which will came first if John has more than one signed will.

 Chapter 13: Will Power 221
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have to this my last will and testa-
ment, written upon this and 1 preceding page, subscribed

presence of us, both present at the 
same time, who at his request, in 
his presence and in the presence 
of each other have hereunto sub-

There’s a strange blather beside the place for John’s signature 
about how the will was signed with everyone in everyone else’s 
presence. It’s actually a description of the proper signing proce-
dure for a will, and in the very next section we untangle the whole 
business.
Signing a Will
You may find it amusing to know that when lawyers talk about 
signing a will they use the term execution. Lawyers don’t have their 
clients sign wills, they have their clients execute them. In this sec-
tion we cover two important matters that must be dealt with when 
a will is signed.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
222
The testator must be legally 
capable of making a will
A testator, to make a valid will, has to be over the age of majority 
(18 or 19, depending on the province), except in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, where the age is 17. There are a couple of exceptions to 
this rule, but they’re so minor that it’s not worth taking up space 
to talk about them. A testator must also be mentally competent to
 
✓ Understand what a will is and what it does.
 
✓ Know and appreciate how much property he or she has.
 
✓ Appreciate who might have a claim to share in his or her 
estate.
And a testator must make the will freely, according to his or her 
own wishes, and not as a result of any violence or threats of vio-
lence, or pressure exerted by someone in a dominant relationship 
with the testator.
If a testator doesn’t meet these three conditions of age, mental 
competence, and free will, the will can be set aside after death. 
Now how would a nasty thing like that happen? Someone who is 
not happy with his or her share under your will (and believes he 
or she would do better under provincial intestacy laws or the pro-
visions of an earlier will) might challenge the validity of your will 
when your executor applies for letters probate (see Chapter 7). To 
meet the challenge, your executor will have to prove that you were 
legally capable, based on the evidence of your witnesses and your 
lawyer, if you sensibly had one.
Legal formalities for signing 
and witnessing a will
A will must be properly signed and witnessed in order to be valid.
 
Signing a will is not something you do all by yourself in a darkened 
room. You have to have a cast of supporting characters — your 
witnesses and, if you’re smart, your lawyer — all of whom have a 
role in these two matters. Your will, or parts of it, may be declared 
invalid after you die if it turns out that you were not legally capable 
of making a will and/or that you did not follow the legal formalities.
Signing
The testator has to sign the will in the presence of two witnesses, 
and the two witnesses must also sign the will, in the presence of 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 223
the testator and in the presence of each other. In other words, the 
testator and the two witnesses must all be present and must all 
watch each other sign the will.
If any changes have been made to the will by hand after it was typed 
or printed, the testator and witnesses must all initial those changes. 
Otherwise it will be presumed that changes were made after the 
testator and witnesses signed the will, and they won’t be valid.
 
If your will is longer than one page it is a good idea (although not 
legally necessary) for you and your witnesses to initial each page 
of the will other than the signature page. This makes it harder for 
someone to substitute different pages in your will after you sign it.
 
There should be only one original of the will for everyone to sign. 
If the testator wants to make the will available for other people to 
read or keep, photocopies of the original should be made after it 
has been signed.
Witnessing
In all provinces, a person who witnesses a will is not allowed to 
receive any gifts under the will. If the testator gives a gift to a 
person under the will and then allows that person to witness the 
will, the testator is giving with one hand and taking away with the 
other! The gift will fail and the person will never receive it. In most 
provinces, a gift to a beneficiary will also fail if the beneficiary’s 
spouse witnessed the will. The purpose of these rules is to prevent 
a beneficiary from forcing a testator to make a will that favours 
the beneficiary. (In some provinces, a beneficiary who witnessed 
or whose spouse witnessed the will can apply to the court for an 
order allowing the beneficiary to receive the gift anyway.)
 
When your executor wants to apply for letters probate (see 
Chapter 7), at least one of your witnesses will be required to give 
evidence that he or she was a witness to your will and that the 
proper legal formalities were followed. This evidence usually takes 
the form of an affidavit of execution of the will — a document in 
which a witness swears under oath that the will was signed by the 
testator in the presence of both witnesses, and that both witnesses 
were present at the same time and signed the will in the testator’s 
presence. Your lawyer will probably ask at least one witness to 
swear an affidavit of execution as soon as possible, because it may 
be difficult or impossible to find your witnesses after your death.
Checking out the testator’s legal capacity to make a will
If you use a lawyer to prepare your will, the lawyer owes a profes-
sional duty to you and your intended beneficiaries to make sure that 
you’re legally capable of making a will at the time you sign it and that 
all legal formalities are followed. Your lawyer should do the following:

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
224
 
✓ Meet with you personally, without any of your beneficiaries 
tagging along.
 
✓ Ask you about your family situation and property to make 
sure that you have not left out an obvious beneficiary and that 
you understand what’s in your estate.
 
✓ Be satisfied of your reasons if you leave out an obvious benefi-
ciary or treat unequally beneficiaries who might ordinarily be 
expected to be treated equally.
 
✓ Review any earlier will and ask why you’re making any major 
changes.
 
✓ Arrange for you to have a medical examination, if your lawyer 
has any doubts about your mental capacity.
 
✓ Be present when you sign your will — unless your lawyer has 
given you complete written instructions on how to sign your 
will and is satisfied that you are mentally competent, and not 
acting under pressure or threats.
If someone challenges your will after you die, your lawyer will be 
able to give evidence that you were legally capable of making a will 
and that all of the legal formalities were followed. Your witnesses 
would probably be dragged in to give evidence too.
Knowing What to Do After 
the Will Is Signed
After you sign your will, keep the original will in a safe place. You can
 
✓ Leave the will with the lawyer who prepared it — most lawyers 
will provide storage in their wills vault, usually free of charge.
 
✓ Store the will with the court (a service available in some 
provinces).
 
✓ Put the will in a fireproof file cabinet in your home.
Do not store your will in your safety deposit box without giving 
your executor a copy to show to the bank, to prove his or her 
authority to open your safety deposit box.
Make sure you tell your executor where to find your original will.
 
If your lawyer is not holding your will for you, make sure that he 
or she gives you the affidavit of execution as well as the original 
will. Otherwise your executor will have to get the affidavit from 
your lawyer after you die — and some lawyers have been known 
to charge an administrative fee for locating the affidavit.

 Chapter 13: Will Power 225
Looking at What Can Go 
Wrong with Your Will
What if something goes wrong with your will? On one hand, it’s not 
your problem. You’re dead. It’s your executor’s problem. It’s your 
beneficiaries’ problem. On the other hand, you chose your execu-
tor carefully, and executors aren’t a dime a dozen. You don’t want 
to set your executor up for failure, or drive him or her to resign 
in a snit. As for your beneficiaries, they may be people you love 
dearly — but whether you love them or not, you went to quite a bit 
of trouble to make arrangements so they would be suitably looked 
after in your absence.
That means you might as well do your will right. The first time. So, 
we’re going to tell you the kinds of things that can go wrong with 
your will, and how to avoid them.
At the planning stage
When you plan your estate, you have many things to take into 
account, and quite a few problems can arise if you don’t plan 
properly.
Choosing the wrong executor
Your executor is the linchpin of your estate plan. If you choose the 
wrong one, your plans can be seriously messed up. For example, an 
executor who is unwell or old and feeble when you die may drop out 
or die before his or her duties are completed. But that’s not really 
such a big problem. One way or another, you’ll still end up with an 
executor (your alternate executor, for example). But executors can 
do worse than get sick or bite the dust. An executor who performs 
the job incompetently or dishonestly can be bad news, big time.
An incompetent executor may
 
✓ Fail to file appropriate tax returns, leading to extra tax pay-
ments in the form of interest and penalties.
 
✓ Fail to take advantage of various tax-saving strategies such as 
making an RRSP donation for your spouse or taking advantage 
of unused capital losses, with the result that your estate loses 
money to the tax authorities unnecessarily.
 
✓ Pay debts that should be challenged (so your estate loses 
money) or fail to pay all of your legitimate debts (so your 
estate is sued).

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
226
 
✓ Make poor investment decisions, so that your estate doesn’t 
increase in value as it could or even loses money.
 
✓ Distribute your estate before your debts and taxes are paid 
(with the result that the executor may have to pay some of 
them personally).
 
✓ Distribute your estate to the wrong beneficiaries or in incor-
rect shares or amounts.
A dishonest executor may
 
✓ Steal money from your estate, either by pocketing estate 
money outright or by overpaying himself or herself for ser-
vices as the executor.
 
✓ Put his or her interests ahead of those of your estate, for 
example by buying property from the estate for a low price, 
or by directing paid estate-related work to himself or herself, 
friends, or family.
 
✓ Deliberately favour one beneficiary over another.
The solution is to choose your executor carefully. We tell you 
about what to look for in an executor in Chapter 7. Review that 
chapter and rethink your choice of executor if advisable. Make 
sure you’ve got an alternate executor — and, if necessary, a trust 
company as an executor of last resort.
Failing to take debts and taxes into account
Your executor must pay the estate’s debts and taxes before giving 
your beneficiaries a cent. There are special rules about where the 
money to pay them comes from, and if you don’t give some fore-
thought to paying debts and taxes, you may be surprised (if you 
were still alive) what your beneficiaries end up getting . . . or not 
getting . . . once those bills have been paid.
Without specific instructions in the will to proceed differently, 
your executor must use the residue of your estate to pay the debts 
and taxes on the estate. The residue is what’s left of your estate 
once your executor has set aside
 
✓ Specific items of real and personal property that you have left 
to named beneficiaries, and
 
✓ Gifts of fixed amounts of cash that you have left to named 
beneficiaries.
First your executor will use the cash in the residue of your estate. 
If there’s not enough cash, your executor will sell property in the 
residue to get cash. If there’s not enough property in the residue to 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 227
raise the cash needed to pay all of your debts and taxes, your exec-
utor will start using the cash that you left to named beneficiaries. 
When that runs out, your executor will sell for cash specific items 
of property that you left to a named beneficiary. Personal property 
(property other than land) is used first, and once it’s used up real 
property (land) is used.
If you don’t take your debts and taxes into account when planning 
your estate, or if you underestimate the amount of your estate’s 
debts and taxes, you may get results you didn’t expect. Here are 
some of the things that can happen.
 
✓ If tax is payable on a specific piece of property given as a gift 
(such as capital gains tax on capital property or income tax 
on an RRSP), the tax will be paid first out of the cash in the 
residue of your estate, not out of the property. One benefi-
ciary will get the property and another beneficiary (the one to 
whom you’re leaving the residue) will get the tax bill.
 
✓ If your estate still has unpaid debts and taxes after your exec-
utor uses up the residue, the people to whom you have left 
specific gifts of cash may not receive their gifts — the cash 
that was supposed to go to them will have to be used to pay 
the debts and taxes.
 
✓ If your estate still has unpaid debts and taxes after your exec-
utor uses up the residue and the cash gifts left to named ben-
eficiaries, the people to whom you have left specific gifts of 
personal property may not receive their gifts — that personal 
property will have to be sold and turned into cash.
 
✓ If your estate still has unpaid debts and taxes after your exec-
utor uses up the residue, the cash gifts left to named benefi-
ciaries, and the personal property left to named beneficiaries, 
the people to whom you left specific gifts of real property may 
not receive their gifts — that real property will have to be 
sold and turned into cash.
 
✓ If there is not enough property in your estate to pay your 
estate’s debts and taxes, your estate is said to be insolvent. 
Your executor will have to divide whatever money there is in 
your estate among the creditors of your estate, following rules 
set by provincial law. (The only good news here is that your 
executor and beneficiaries won’t have to dig into their own 
pockets to pay your debts.)
If you’re pretty sure that you’re going to die owing money — for 
example, if you have a mortgage or big capital gains and don’t have 
a lot of cash in your estate — take out life insurance in an amount 
that will cover what you expect to owe. See Chapter 4 for informa-
tion about life insurance.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
228
If it’s taxes rather than debts in general that will cause trouble, 
plan your estate so that no tax is payable on particular property. 
For example, take advantage of the spousal rollover provisions to 
leave RRSPs or property subject to capital gains to your spouse. 
To avoid one beneficiary getting the property and another benefi-
ciary getting the tax bill, you can also include instructions in your 
will that the tax on a particular gift is to be paid out of a specific 
fund (for example, out of the stocks you’re giving the beneficiary). 
See Chapter 3, where we talk about estate tax solutions.
Neglecting your spouse or dependants
You have some relatives it doesn’t pay to forget in your will. 
Because even though you forget them, they may not forget you. 
Then your careful estate plan can be shot to pieces, because these 
people have a first claim on your estate. They are
 
✓ Your spouse, who under family law in some provinces may 
have a right to claim a minimum share of your estate, and
 
✓ Those who are financially dependent on you, who under suc-
cession law or dependants’ relief law in all provinces may 
have a claim against your estate.
Failing to take these relatives into account can result in
 
✓ Litigation for your estate: A spouse or dependant may start 
a legal action against your estate if you don’t leave him or her 
enough money in your will. The time period to start an action 
is usually six months. The court often orders the costs of 
estate litigation to be paid out of the estate itself.
 
✓ Delayed distribution of your estate: What happens to your 
other beneficiaries if you don’t make adequate provision for 
your spouse and/or dependants? Their share of the estate will 
end up being reduced by the amount you should have left to 
your spouse and/or dependants in the first place, plus the legal 
and other costs involved in dealing with the claim. And they’ll 
have to wait until any court proceeding started by your spouse 
and/or dependants is finished before they get what’s left.
 
✓ Reduced shares for your beneficiaries: If you don’t make 
adequate provision for your spouse and/or dependants, your 
beneficiaries’ share of the estate will end up being reduced 
by the amount you should have left to your spouse and/or 
dependants in the first place, plus the legal and other costs 
involved in dealing with the claim. And they’ll have to wait 
until any court proceeding started by your spouse and/or 
dependants is finished before they get what’s left.
The solution is to make sure you make a proper provision for your 
relatives and dependants from the outset, even if it means leaving 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 229
less of your estate to people you really want to have it. See Chapter 
7 where we talk about the claims that your spouse or dependants 
might have against your estate.
Failing to set up a trust for beneficiaries who are minors
If you leave property directly to a child under the age of majority, 
your executor can be required to pay the money or hand over the 
property to the provincial government. The provincial public trustee 
will manage it according to rules set out by provincial law, until 
the child’s 18th or 19th birthday (depending on the province). The 
government will invest all of the child’s money in very conservative 
investments, so there will probably be a low return on investment. 
Whoever has custody of the child will have to apply to the govern-
ment any time money is needed for the child. The government will 
hand over money only if it approves of the plan to spend the money.
When the child reaches the age of majority, the government will 
turn all the money and property over to the child, whether or not 
the child is mature and responsible enough not to blow it all on tat-
toos and belly button rings.
The solution is to set up a trust (discussed in Chapter 6) if you leave 
any money or property to a beneficiary who is under the age of major-
ity. Then you, instead of the provincial government, have control over 
investment and spending decisions and can determine the age the 
child will be when the trust property is turned over.
Neglecting to name someone to look after your children
If you don’t name someone appropriate as your children’s guard-
ian, a custody battle over your children is more likely, and the 
courts will have to decide without the benefit of knowing your 
views on the subject.
The solution is to appoint an appropriate guardian — a person the 
court will agree to (based on the factors we discuss in Chapter 8).
Failing to plan to pass on your business
A business that you own may be the most valuable thing in your 
estate. Don’t waste a cent of it. If you don’t plan properly,
 
✓ Your estate may end up paying more in taxes because you 
didn’t do anything while you were alive to take advantage of 
tax-reduction or tax-avoidance strategies.
 
✓ Your estate may end up having to sell your business under 
poor market conditions, getting less than your business is 
really worth.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
230
 
✓ Your estate may be unable to get the necessary consents to 
transfer your shares in a privately held corporation to your 
beneficiaries — then they won’t be able to participate in the 
running of the corporation or to sell out for cash.
 
✓ Your partners may be unable or unwilling to purchase your 
partnership interest from your estate, and then your estate 
may receive no money from your business.
 
✓ You may create arguments among family members who can’t 
agree whether to try to run the business or sell it.
The solution is to follow the advice we give in Chapter 9 on passing 
on your business, or at least the value of your business.
At the drafting stage
Are you thinking of writing your will yourself? We hope not. But 
just in case you are, in this section we tell you about some of the 
things that can go wrong with a will drafted by a non-lawyer.
Now don’t get us wrong. Using a lawyer to prepare your will is not 
an absolute guarantee that no problems will arise. Even lawyers 
make mistakes. The difference between you and a lawyer, however, 
is that your beneficiaries can sue an incompetent lawyer and get 
money to correct the mistake. You’re not insured against making 
mistakes when you draft a will — so your beneficiaries will just 
have to lump your mistakes.
If you take it into your head to write your own will, you can run 
into trouble in a lot of different ways, and in the following sections, 
we consider some of the most common ones.
Residue
Two very common mistakes are to leave out the residue clause 
entirely, and to divide up the residue wrongly.
The residue clause gives away whatever property you have left 
after you’ve given specific gifts. Even if you think you’ve given 
away everything you own in a specific gift, there’s a risk that you’ll 
leave something out, and the court may have to decide what to do 
with your property. Going to court is expensive, and the legal fees 
will very likely come out of the estate. Further, your executor may 
not be able to distribute any of your estate until the matter has 
been settled — and the legal fees have been paid.

 Chapter 13: Will Power 231
If the residue of your estate is going to just one person, there’s 
no problem with dividing it wrongly. But if you want to divide the 
residue among two or more people, you have to be careful how 
you say it’s to be divided. If you make a mistake, the residue may 
end up being paid out as if you didn’t have a will. Read the sidebar 
“The wrong stuff” for an example.
Unclear wording
Maybe you know what you mean, but will anyone else who reads 
your will? Your executor has to be able to understand your instruc-
tions in order to follow them.
Examples speak louder than explanation. Say you’re the executor. 
What does the testator want you to do in the following situations?
 
✓ The will says, “Divide my estate equally between my cousins.” 
The testator has two first cousins, six second cousins, and 
ten third cousins. Does the testator want his estate divided 
between his two first cousins or among all of his cousins? 
Does it help any if we tell you that the testator rarely spoke to 
his first cousins but was on good terms with two of his second 
cousins?
 
✓ The will says, “I leave $10,000 to my brother and sister.” 
Does the testator want you to pay $10,000 to the brother and 
$10,000 to the sister? Or to divide the $10,000 between them?
 
✓ The will says, “Divide my estate between my wife and my sis-
ters.” The testator has two sisters. Does the testator want you 
to give one-third of his estate each to his wife and his sisters 
or does he want you to give one-half of his estate to his wife 
and to divide the other half between his two sisters?
The wrong stuff
John wanted his estate to be divided equally among his four best friends, Alan, 
Wally, Gordo, and Gus. He wrote a will giving a couple of small specific gifts to 
distant family members and then directed his executor to divide the residue 
of his estate into four equal shares and to pay one share to each of his friends. 
Unfortunately, Gus died before John did, and John didn’t change his will after that 
happened. When John dies, where does the fourth share go?
It doesn’t go to the other best friends. Under provincial law, it has to be paid out as 
though John had died without making a will. It ends up going to John’s evil twin. To 
avoid this tragedy, John would have had to write in his will something like, “Divide 
the residue of my estate into as many equal shares as I have the following friends 
alive at the time of my death.”

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
232
If your instructions are unclear, your executor may have to apply 
to the court for help in interpreting your will, or your beneficiaries 
may challenge your will in court. Your estate will probably end up 
paying the cost of court proceedings. And that gets paid before 
your beneficiaries get their gifts.
Unconsidered “what-ifs”
When you’re writing a will, you can’t assume that your life and your 
beneficiaries’ lives are going to continue exactly as they are, right up 
to the time of your death. You have to explore the path at each fork 
and consider the “what-ifs.” If you don’t, results you didn’t expect 
may arise when your estate is distributed. For example:
 
✓ What if you don’t own then what you own now? If your will 
gives a specific piece of property to a beneficiary but you no 
longer own that piece of property when you die, your gift will 
fail and your beneficiary will get nothing. For example, if your 
will says, “I leave my motorcycle to my friend Riley,” Riley will 
get nothing if you sell your motorcycle and buy a car before 
you die. Your car will go to the person to whom you have left 
the residue of your estate. Riley will get the car only if you 
leave a replacement gift in your will. Your will would have to 
say, “I leave my motorcycle, or whatever other form of vehicu-
lar transport I may own at my death, to my friend Riley.”
 
 If your will gives a cash gift to a named beneficiary and identi-
fies a specific fund out of which the gift is to be paid, but the 
fund doesn’t exist when you die, the gift will fail and your 
beneficiary will get nothing. For example, if your will states, 
“I direct my executor to sell my collection of Polaroid photo-
graphs of airplanes and to pay to my friend Goose the sum of 
$5,000 out of the proceeds of the sale,” Goose will get nothing 
if you sell your photograph collection before you die. If you 
want Goose to get $5,000 regardless, just leave him the money 
and don’t specify the source.
 
✓ What if your beneficiary dies before you do? If your will 
gives a specific gift of cash or property to a named benefi-
ciary and the beneficiary dies before you, generally speaking 
the gift will fail. The cash or property will go to the person 
who’s getting the residue of your estate. For example, if your 
will says, “I leave my fur coat to my friend Betsy,” and Betsy 
dies before you do, the coat will go to Elaine, to whom you’ve 
given the residue of your estate. That may be okay with you. 
But what if you wanted Betsy’s daughter to get the coat? Or 
what if you wanted your assistant Gail to get it? Some prov-
inces have a statutory provision that sends a gift that has 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 233
failed on to the spouse and/or children of a beneficiary who 
predeceased you. The provision usually applies to beneficia-
ries who are close relatives of the testator — children, grand-
children, brothers, or sisters. That won’t help here. And why 
count on the provincial government to solve problems that 
don’t need to arise in the first place?
 
 If you don’t want the property to go back to the residue, make 
a gift of it to an alternative beneficiary if your first choice dies. 
If you want Betsy’s daughter to get the coat, your will should 
say, “I leave my fur coat to my friend Betsy, but if she prede-
ceases me, I leave my fur coat to Betsy’s daughter, Melissa.” If 
Betsy’s daughter dies before you do and you still don’t want 
Elaine to get the coat, then your will should say, “I leave my 
fur coat to my friend Betsy, but if she predeceases me, I leave 
my fur coat to Betsy’s daughter, Melissa. If Betsy’s daughter 
predeceases me, I leave my fur coat to my assistant, Gail.”
If you leave the residue of your estate to two or more people and 
one of them dies before you do, the residue will go to whoever is 
still alive. If you leave the residue to one person and that person 
dies before you do, the residue will be given away as if you had 
died without leaving a valid will. The same thing is true if you 
leave the residue to two or more people together, or to one or 
two people plus an alternate, and they all die before you. (We talk 
about intestate succession in Chapter 12.) How can that happen? 
Have a look at “Vanishing point” for an example.
 
If you want to control where the residue goes no matter what, name 
alternate beneficiaries until you run out of friends and relatives 
you actually want to give your property to. Then name a charity as 
beneficiary of last resort. If you don’t, the provincial law of intestate 
succession decides who your beneficiary of last resort is — it will be 
the provincial government if you don’t have any surviving relatives.
Vanishing point
Zack left the residue of his estate to his wife, Paula, if she survived him, to his 
children if she didn’t, and to the children of any child who predeceased him. That’s 
pretty standard stuff and it covers three generations of beneficiaries. Unfortunately, 
Zack and his entire family (his children were all under the age of 12) drowned while 
on a fishing trip. Zack’s estate went to his father, to whom he hadn’t spoken in 
years. If Zack had thought about it, he would have preferred to give his estate to 
his good friend Matthew.

234
Insufficient power to the executor
You may choose an excellent executor but then spoil everything 
by failing to give him or her broad enough powers to properly 
manage the assets in your estate. What can go wrong here?
 
✓ If you don’t give your executor the right to decide when or 
whether to sell estate property, by provincial law your execu-
tor has to turn the property of the estate into cash immedi-
ately. You may not have wanted everything sold for cash, and 
your estate may not get that much cash if your executor isn’t 
allowed to wait for good market conditions.
 
✓ If you don’t give your executor the right to use your unused 
RRSP contribution to make an RRSP donation for your spouse, 
your executor won’t be able to take advantage of this tax-saving 
strategy.
 
✓ If you don’t give your executor the right to choose what kind 
of investments to make, or don’t specify what kind of invest-
ments you want the executor to make, your executor will be 
restricted to making investments allowed by provincial law.
 
✓ If you don’t give your executor the right to decide whether 
to pay money out of trust to a minor beneficiary, and you 
don’t specify in what circumstances a payment can be made, 
your executor may be unable to make any payment out to the 
minor — without applying to court — until the kid reaches 
the age when the trust ends.
After reading this section, you may — or may not — be able to 
avoid the particular problems we talk about. But there are lots of 
other problems to run into. If you insist on going ahead and draft-
ing your own will, you’ll be asking for trouble. And trouble has a 
way of obliging.
At the signing stage
So your next bright idea is to execute your will without a lawyer’s 
supervision, is it?
Earlier in this chapter we tell you about the legal formalities that 
apply when you execute (sign) a will. These formalities apply 
even if you’ve got a do-it-yourself will. (And if you’ve written out 
the will yourself — called a holograph will, as explained later in 
this chapter — the only formality that doesn’t apply concerns the 
signing and witnessing.) If you don’t meet the legal formalities, all 
or part of your will may be invalid. Then either an earlier will you 
made will be the one that passes on your estate or, if you have no 

 Chapter 13: Will Power 235
earlier valid will, the intestacy provisions of your province will 
govern what happens to your estate (we explain those provisions 
in Chapter 12).
Signed and witnessed
You and (in most provinces) two witnesses must all be present 
together in the same room and must all sign the will (you first) and 
must all watch each other sign the will, as we explain in the section 
“Signing a Will” earlier in this chapter.
In order to get your will probated (declared by the court to be 
your legitimate will, as described in Chapter 7), at least one of your 
witnesses will be required to swear under oath in an affidavit of 
execution that he or she was a witness to your will and that you 
and your witnesses were all present and all watched each other 
sign. What if you make a change by hand to your prepared will just 
before you and your witnesses sign it? Say you change “$10,000” to 
“$20,000,” or “Alzheimer’s Society” to “Parkinson’s Foundation”? 
If you and your witnesses don’t all initial any such changes, they 
won’t be valid. The law will presume that the change was made 
after you and the witnesses signed the will.
Finally, suppose your will is two or more pages long. It’s just a bunch 
of sheets of paper stapled or paper-clipped together. What’s to stop 
some evildoer from rewriting one of the pages and slipping that sub-
stitute page into your will? Nothing much. That’s why lawyers have 
the testator and witnesses initial each page of the will in addition to 
the signature page. Then a substitution is more difficult.
It’s not always that easy for a testator to find someone, and espe-
cially two someones, to witness a will. So you may just grab onto 
whoever’s handy. The people who are handy are likely to be the 
people who are always hanging around — and they’re likely to be 
the people you’re leaving something to in your will. But a person 
who witnesses a will is not allowed to receive any gifts under the 
will. In most provinces a person whose spouse witnesses the will is 
also not allowed to receive any gifts under the will.
Mental competence and free will
If you’re reading this book and you understand at least one word in 
three (one word in nine in the tax chapters), you’re probably legally 
capable of making a will. However, that’s not the legal test of mental 
competence. As we explain in the section “Signing a Will” earlier in 
this chapter, the legal test asks whether you’ve got your wits suf-
ficiently about you to understand what a will is and what it does, 
know and appreciate how much property you have, and appreciate 
which people might have a claim to share in your estate. You also 
have to be acting freely, not under threats or violence, or under 
pressure from a person who has a dominant relationship with you.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
236
If your will is challenged after you die by someone who claims that 
you were mentally incompetent, or acted under pressure from 
someone dominant over you, your executor will have to defend 
your will in court by showing that you were mentally competent 
and acting of your own free will when you signed the will. If you 
didn’t use a lawyer to prepare your will and supervise execution, 
you’ve taken away the executor’s best evidence for the defence.
After your will is signed
Even if you did everything right — you planned properly and you 
had a lawyer draft your will and oversee its execution — it can all 
go wrong with the passage of time and changing circumstances.
Unless your “what-ifs” were deadly accurate or totally comprehen-
sive, you need to review your will on a regular basis, especially if 
there’s a significant event in your life. Take your will out of storage, re-
read it, and ask yourself if you need to revise it, if there’s a change in
 
✓ Your personal life: If you marry, if your spouse or partner or 
any close relative dies, if you separate or divorce, if you meet 
someone new, if you have a new child, or if someone in your 
family develops special needs.
 
✓ Your business life: If your business becomes more (or less) 
successful, if you change the business you’re in, or if you 
change the form of business you carry on (such as a change 
from a sole proprietorship to a corporation).
 
✓ Your executor’s life: If your executor dies or becomes ill or sug-
gests he or she would rather not take on the work involved in 
looking after your estate, or even if your executor moves away.
 
✓ The nature and value of your property: If you increase (or 
decrease) the value of your estate significantly, acquire new 
kinds of property (if you go from renting to home owner-
ship or if you start building up an investment portfolio from 
scratch), acquire property in a different province or a foreign 
country, or find that you have growing debts.
 
✓ The law: If tax laws change (which they do almost daily), or if 
laws relating to the family or wills and estates change.
 
✓ Your place of residence: If you move to a different province or 
a foreign country.
Even one of these changes can mean that your will won’t work 
the way you planned. So though it’s a bit morbid, make a habit of 
reviewing your will regularly. In Chapter 18 we tell you more about 
the impact that your life can have on your will, and why your first 
will probably shouldn’t be your last will.

 Chapter 13: Will Power 237
Considering the Dangers 
of Do-It-Yourself Wills
A will doesn’t have to be prepared by a lawyer to be valid. It’s pos-
sible, although not smart, to prepare your will all by yourself. Do-it-
yourselfers could
 
✓ Write out the entire will by hand (then it would be a holograph 
will, more about which below).
 
✓ Buy a pre-printed form from a stationery store and fill in the 
blanks.
 
✓ Prepare a will based on a sample lawyer-drafted will (like John 
Robinson’s) or using computer software.
 
✓ Buy a will “kit” and fill in a form using instructions in the kit.
But no matter how you go about it, you’re asking for trouble when 
you prepare your own will.
Holograph wills
A holograph will is a will that is completely written out in the testa-
tor’s own handwriting.
In Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, 
Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, and the 
Yukon, a holograph will is valid as long as it is dated and signed 
by the testator. It doesn’t have to be signed in the presence of wit-
nesses. In fact, in some of these provinces, a holograph will doesn’t 
even have to be signed by the testator. So, a holograph will is easy 
to prepare. You sit down with a piece of paper and a pen. You 
don’t need a lawyer; you don’t need a witness (in most provinces); 
you just need you.
 
A holograph will is also dangerous, exactly because no lawyer 
and no witnesses are involved. It can be challenged more easily 
by someone claiming that you were mentally incompetent or not 
acting of your own free will at the time you made it.
In British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, a hand-
written will must be signed and witnessed just like any other will 
in order to be valid (unless the testator is a member of the armed 
forces).

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
238
 
If the testator types out a will or fills in blanks on a pre-printed form, 
the document will probably not be considered to be a holograph will. 
That means it is not valid unless it has been signed and witnessed.
Will Kits
You’ve probably heard “will kits” being advertised. The theory is 
that you’ll save the money you would have spent on a lawyer and 
still get legal advice about how to write a will. Will kits claim to 
provide easy-to-use forms and step-by-step instructions on how to 
complete them.
We’ve looked at will kits and we’re suspicious of them because
 
✓ The guides provide only limited advice about planning your 
will — they’re very short (as opposed to this book, which is 
agonizingly long and still keeps telling you to see a lawyer).
 
✓ The easy-to-use forms tend to be blank in all of the difficult 
places and complete only in the places you could probably 
figure out on your own. (See the sidebar “Drawing a blank.”)
 
✓ The guides give very little direction on the wording and language 
to use in completing the form — and as we tell you elsewhere in 
this book, wording and language can make or break your will.
 
✓ You’re on your own when it comes to executing your will — 
the will kit people don’t send over a lawyer to make sure 
that you’re mentally competent, or provide witnesses to 
whom you’re leaving nothing in your will.
 
A will kit may save you a few hundred dollars in lawyer’s fees. If 
your estate is worth more that, don’t mess around on your own 
with a will kit. Get a lawyer to prepare your will!
Drawing a blank
The will form in one leading will kit has pre-printed paragraphs revoking earlier 
wills, appointing an executor, stating that any gift to a minor is to be held in trust, 
and appointing someone to have custody of young children.
When it comes to gifts, all that’s pre-printed are the words, “I make the following 
gifts:” followed by a blank space about 3⁄4 of a page long, and then the words “I give 
all of the residue of my estate to” followed by a blank space about 1⁄4 of a page long.
The will form does not contain or leave space for (or directions to include) instruc-
tions to the executor to pay the debts and taxes of the estate or extra powers for 
the executor.

n most other chapters in this book, we ask the unpleasant 
question, “What happens if you die?” In this chapter, we change 
tactics and ask you, “What happens if your body fails or you lose 
your mind (and then you die)?”
It’s not uncommon for people to be disabled for a period of time — 
in some cases for years — before they die. It’s not a scenario any 
of us likes to confront. For some people, disability is worse to face 
than dying.
While you’re in the process of planning how to care for your family 
and friends after you die, you should also make plans to care for 
yourself and them if you become disabled.

Discovering What Will Happen to 
Your Finances if Your Physical or 
Mental Health Fails
You could just be walking along in apparently perfect health one 
day and keel over dead from a heart attack. Then you wouldn’t 
have to worry about failing health, would you? And it certainly 
happens that some people are alive and in fine fettle in the morn-
ing and gone by the evening.
But that’s not what happens to most people. A decline before death 
is much more common, whether it takes place overnight, or over a 
few weeks or a few years. That decline is likely to include a period of 
time when you’re physically unable to get around (you might be in 
the hospital, or at home but too weak or tired to get out) or mentally 
unable to make sound decisions about your affairs. Read the sidebar 
“Phenomenally powerless” to see what can happen.
Looking after business
How are you going to receive your income, pay your expenses, and 
take care of (or sell) your investments, real estate, and other prop-
erty if you become disabled?
If you become physically disabled, you’ll have trouble getting out 
and about. But with delivery from stores, credit card transactions, 
automatic bank deposit and withdrawal, Internet banking, tele-
phone, e-mail and ordinary mail, and house calls when absolutely 
necessary from professionals such as lawyers and real estate 
agents, your life doesn’t have to grind to a halt. Still, it would be 
convenient and might sometimes be essential to have someone 
else look after business for you.
 
If your mind weakens (whether or not your body remains willing) 
and you become mentally incapable, you won’t be legally able to 
transact your legal and financial affairs whether you are physically 
able to or not. Perhaps worse, you may still be physically able to 
transact affairs that would do serious harm to yourself and 
your estate.
A person is considered to be mentally incapable of making legal and 
financial decisions when he or she is not able to understand infor-
mation that is relevant to making a decision, or is not able to appre-
ciate what is likely to happen as a result of making the decision.

 Chapter 14: Powers of Attorney: Who’ll Manage Your Money? 241
 
If you become mentally incapable of looking after your own affairs, 
you won’t be able to enter into contracts — and that will cut off your 
personal ability, for example, to
 
✓ Buy or sell investments.
 
✓ Buy or sell real estate.
 
✓ Buy or sell big-ticket items like a car.
 
✓ Open a bank account or rent a safety deposit box.
 
✓ Take out a mortgage.
 
✓ Rent an apartment or make arrangements to go into a seniors’ 
residence or a nursing home.
They’ll probably still take your cash down at the grocery store or 
pharmacy, and your bank may let you withdraw small amounts of 
money at reasonable intervals. But many merchants and almost all 
banks will get very nervous if you don’t appear to be all there and 
you want to do something involving even a moderately large sum 
of money.
Other people you want to deal with may well go along with you 
too, if you don’t look too glassy-eyed or talk too strangely (this 
Phenomenally powerless
George was a successful businessman who ran a garage in a small town. He kept 
his affairs in order and had made a will. One day George got zapped by a bolt of light 
out of the sky and was left with impaired mental abilities and a number of physical 
problems. He was no longer able to handle business at the garage or even work as 
a mechanic. He was mentally unable to make plans about how to support himself, 
his wife, Lace, and their children. Lace thought that he could sell some of his invest-
ments, or real estate that he owned, to get some money to tide them over — but 
George simply didn’t have the physical or mental ability to look after this kind of 
business any more.
Lace asked George’s broker if he would sell some of the investments without 
George’s own instructions, and the broker said he couldn’t do that. A real estate 
agent Lace contacted said that she couldn’t deal with Lace because the property 
Lace wanted to sell was in George’s name. Lace was at her wits’ end about what 
to do for money.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action

is especially true if you transact business by mail or e-mail). 
However, this approach has two problems:
 
✓ You may, in your vacantness, want to enter into a contract 
that is harmful to you, or the other party to the contract may 
want to take advantage of your state of mind to defraud you.
 
✓ Even if the contract is perfectly fair, it can be challenged and 
set aside if someone realizes that you were not mentally 
competent when you entered into it.
Looking for help!
If you’re mentally incapable you will need someone else to con-
duct your legal and financial affairs for you all the time. If you’re 
physically disabled you may need someone else to conduct your 
legal and financial affairs for you only some of the time. In order to 
give someone else the ability to look after your affairs, you need 
to prepare a power of attorney. A power of attorney is a document 
that gives another person authority to handle legal and/or financial 
affairs of the person who signs the document.
 
Before we go any further, we have to have a vocabulary section. 
That’s because a power of attorney isn’t known as a power of 
attorney in every province. We plan to call it a power of attorney 
throughout this chapter, but depending on the province it may be 
known as a power of attorney for personal property, a power of attor-
ney for financial decisions, a mandate, or a representation agreement. 
Similarly, we’re going to call the person who makes and signs the 
power of attorney the principal, although depending on the province 
this person might also be known as the donor or the grantor. Finally, 
we will refer to the person chosen by the principal to handle affairs 
as the attorney, although depending on the province this person 
might be known as the attorney in fact, the agent, the donee, the man-
datary, or the representative.
Got it together now? The principal wants another person to look 
after the principal’s legal and/or financial affairs, so the principal 
signs a power of attorney document appointing the person of his 
or her choice to be the attorney.
 
A power of attorney must be created when you are mentally capable. 
To be considered mentally capable of creating the power of attor-
ney, you must be capable of knowing the value and kind of prop-
erty you own and of understanding the powers that you are giving 
to another person.

 Chapter 14: Powers of Attorney: Who’ll Manage Your Money? 243
Examining the Different Types 
of Powers of Attorney
A power of attorney is quite flexible in its use. You don’t have to 
be mentally or physically incapable to want one, you just have to 
want someone else to look after a legal or financial matter for you.
Examples, anyone? You can create a power of attorney that gives 
your accountant the power to handle all of your affairs for a short 
period while you’re out of the country and out of reach, or one that 
gives your daughter the authority to sell your cottage, or one that 
gives your nephew the authority to make deposits and withdrawals 
in your bank account. You can also create a power of attorney that 
gives a relative, friend, or professional adviser the power to look 
after all of your affairs for the rest of your life.
 
A power of attorney has no flexibility in one respect, though: It 
ends as soon as the principal dies. It cannot take the place of a will, 
and it cannot override the provisions of a will. And an attorney 
cannot make a will on behalf of the principal.
Enduring or continuing 
power of attorney
 
An ordinary power of attorney is valid only as long as the principal 
is mentally competent. It automatically ends when the principal 
becomes mentally incompetent. For many people, of course, this 
is exactly the point at which they want the power of attorney to 
come into play.
The answer is the enduring or continuing power of attorney. It is 
intended to continue in effect even after the principal becomes men-
tally incompetent. What’s needed to turn an ordinary power of attor-
ney into an enduring power of attorney is a specific statement in the 
power of attorney document that the power of attorney is intended 
to continue after the principal becomes mentally incompetent.
General or specific power 
of attorney
A power of attorney can be general or specific.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
244
A general power of attorney gives the attorney power to make 
many or all financial and legal decisions on the principal’s behalf. 
In most provinces, a general power of attorney gives the attorney 
authority to make any financial or legal decision that the principal 
could make, and to do any financial or legal act that the principal 
could do — except prepare or change the principal’s will. The 
principal can impose limitations on the attorney’s power when 
the document is prepared. But if the principal does not do so, the 
attorney has complete power to manage the principal’s affairs. 
That includes, for example, receiving money and paying bills; 
opening and closing bank accounts; making bank deposits and 
withdrawals; making and cashing in investments; buying, mortgag-
ing, and selling property; and hiring and firing workers (such as 
caregivers) for the principal.
A specific power of attorney gives the attorney power to carry out 
the transactions mentioned in the document. For example, it could 
allow the attorney to do personal banking, or to deal with stated 
sources of income such as investment income and dividends, or to 
carry out a particular activity such as selling a vacation property.
In Quebec, the situation is somewhat different. A power of attorney 
(called a mandate) automatically gives the attorney (called the 
mandatary) the authority only to make decisions and take actions 
that are necessary to preserve the principal’s property, and it 
strictly limits the way in which the attorney can invest the princi-
pal’s money. In addition, the attorney must get a court order to sell 
any of the principal’s property. A Quebec power of attorney docu-
ment must give the attorney “full administrative powers” in order 
to create a general power of attorney like that discussed above.
Banking power of attorney
Banks have specific power of attorney documents for banking mat-
ters. You can usually get a form at your local branch, and if you 
want to make only a specific power of attorney for banking you 
don’t need to go anywhere else to get a power of attorney. In fact, 
even if you have a general power of attorney prepared by your 
lawyer, your bank may insist that it needs a power of attorney for 
banking in its own form. You (or your attorney armed with a gen-
eral power of attorney) may have an uphill climb to convince the 
bank employees that a general power of attorney includes a bank-
ing power of attorney.
 
If your bank refuses to accept the general power of attorney and 
insists on its own banking power of attorney, have a lawyer check 
over the bank’s form before you sign it, to make sure that it doesn’t 
cancel the general power of attorney.

 Chapter 14: Powers of Attorney: Who’ll Manage Your Money? 245
 
Because it may be too late for you to sign a banking power of attor-
ney by the time your general power of attorney is needed, you 
should have a discussion with the manager of your bank branch 
at the time you’re having a general power of attorney prepared. 
Ask whether the general power of attorney will be acceptable. If it 
looks like the bank is going to be stubborn, take the bank’s form 
for the banking power of attorney to your lawyer for review.
Peering into the Contents 
of a Power of Attorney
The power of attorney document differs from province to province. 
In most provinces, though, a power of attorney document usually
 
✓ Names the attorney(s). If more than one attorney is being 
appointed, the document should say whether the attorneys 
may make decisions alone or whether they must agree on all 
decisions. Sometimes a power of attorney also names a substi-
tute attorney who takes over if the original attorney is unable 
or unwilling to carry out the required duties.
 
✓ Cancels previously made powers of attorney. If an earlier power 
of attorney is in effect and the principal wants it to continue in 
effect, the later document must make that clear. (It’s this can-
celling clause in the banking power of attorney that can lead 
to trouble if you’ve already got a general power of attorney.)
 
✓ Sets out the powers the attorney is to have. The attorney can 
be given all powers the principal has, or any part of the prin-
cipal’s powers — such as the power to carry out certain types 
of transactions (for example, banking) or the power to deal 
with certain types of property (for example, investments or 
real estate).
 
✓ Indicates whether or not the power of attorney remains in effect 
after the principal becomes mentally incompetent. If the docu-
ment says nothing about this, then it ends when the principal 
becomes mentally incompetent. If it is meant to continue in 
effect, the document must say so in the words required by the 
law of the province in which the power of attorney is to be used.
 
✓ States when the power of attorney comes into effect. A power 
of attorney can come into effect immediately or at some time 
in the future. In some provinces it comes into effect as soon 
as it has been signed and witnessed. (To prevent the attorney 
from acting before the principal is ready to hand over the reins, 
the principal can have a third person — say the principal’s 
lawyer — hold onto the document until the principal becomes 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
246
mentally incapable.) In other provinces, the principal can 
decide when it will come into effect — on a specified date 
or on the happening of a specified event (usually the mental 
incapacity of the principal).
 
 If the power of attorney is to come into effect when the princi-
pal becomes mentally incapable, in some provinces the power 
of attorney document can say how it’s to be decided that the 
principal has become incapable (for example, by the opinion 
of the principal’s doctor or lawyer). If the document doesn’t 
say anything about how to decide, then the provincial statute 
governing powers of attorney applies. In some provinces, the 
statute says that two doctors must agree that the principal 
is incapable. In other provinces, the statute says that a court 
must decide.
 
✓ Says whether the attorney is to be paid. In most provinces, the 
attorney is not entitled to be paid unless the power of attorney 
says so. If the attorney is to be paid, the document may set out 
the amount or the provincial government may set the rate.
 
✓ Makes conditions about how the attorney is to exercise his 
or her powers. The document can say that the attorney has 
to invest in certain types of investments, or consult with or 
report to the principal’s family members or financial advisers, 
or keep financial records in a certain form.
Preparing a Power of Attorney
There’s no legal requirement that a lawyer (or, in Quebec, a 
notary) has to prepare the power of attorney document. It’s per-
fectly legal for a person to write out his or her own version, or fill 
out a pre-printed form.
 
We strongly recommend that you not go the do-it-yourself route, 
though. A power of attorney is much like a will — there are special 
rules about who can be an attorney and who can be a witness, and it 
also takes some legal knowledge to know what to put in the docu-
ment and what to leave out. Later in this section we tell you about 
some of the things that can go wrong for do-it-yourselfers.
The attorney
For the most part, choosing an attorney is not difficult. The attorney 
can be anyone who has reached the age of majority (18 or 19, 
depending on the province) and is mentally competent. Alternatively, 
the attorney can be a financial institution (usually a trust company).

 Chapter 14: Powers of Attorney: Who’ll Manage Your Money? 247
 
Choose an attorney whom you trust and who you think would 
make the same kinds of decisions about your financial matters that 
you would make.
However, some traps may await the principal who doesn’t get legal 
advice and assistance:
 
✓ In some provinces, an attorney who is the spouse of the prin-
cipal may run into trouble if he or she later tries to mortgage, 
sell, or otherwise transfer the family residence. Under the 
family law statutes in some provinces, both spouses must 
consent to such a transaction. One spouse won’t be able to 
use a power of attorney to give the other spouse’s consent to 
such a transaction. (That’s to make sure that, for example, a 
wife isn’t using the power of attorney to transfer or mortgage 
the family residence out from under her husband.) So it might 
turn out, in your province, that your spouse is not the best 
person to be your attorney if your family home may have to 
be sold or mortgaged.
 
✓ If the principal wants to name more than one attorney, the 
principal has to state in the document whether each attorney 
can act alone or whether the attorneys must act together. If 
you don’t say anything, they must act together.
 
✓ The principal may forget to name a substitute attorney in 
case the first choice is unwilling or unable to take on or 
continue the job.
The powers
A principal may well find it useful to have the help of a lawyer to 
give the attorney the proper powers. A do-it-yourself principal may 
make mistakes because
 
✓ For the power of attorney to remain valid after the principal 
becomes mentally incompetent, the document has to include 
specific wording. If the required wording isn’t used, the power 
of attorney may end just when it will be needed.
 
✓ If the principal wants an earlier power of attorney to remain in 
effect (for example, a general power of attorney), a later power 
of attorney (for example, a banking power of attorney) must 
not contain a revocation clause that cancels the earlier one.
 
✓ If the principal wants to limit the attorney’s powers in some 
way, or have the attorney show financial records to someone 
for review, the document has to be deal with that specifically.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
248
 
✓ If the power of attorney is going to be used in connection 
with real estate, special wording may be required, as well as 
special signing procedures. In some provinces, the people 
witnessing the signing of the power of attorney may then have 
to swear an oath before a commissioner or notary public that 
they are the witnesses.
 
✓ If the principal has property in another province, one power 
of attorney may not be enough — a second power of attorney, 
valid in the other province, may have to be prepared.
The process
 
It’s just as important to get the details of creating the power of 
attorney right as it is to get the right words in the document. A 
lawyer will make sure that all the legal requirements for properly 
giving a power of attorney are met.
The principal must be in the right state
A lawyer will make sure that the principal has reached the age 
of majority (easy) and is mentally competent to give a power of 
attorney (harder). Your lawyer won’t let you sign a power of attor-
ney document if you’re mentally incompetent — there wouldn’t 
be much point, because it wouldn’t be valid if you sign it while 
incompetent. If your lawyer has doubts about you, he or she may 
even refer you to a doctor for an examination before agreeing to 
assist you in creating a power of attorney. This is a safeguard to 
make sure that you know what you’re doing when you give another 
person power over your financial affairs.
If someone later questions whether you were mentally competent 
when you signed the document, your lawyer will be able to give 
evidence that you were. Why would someone challenge your 
mental competence at the time you signed? Because that person 
doesn’t like the attorney you chose or the decisions the attorney 
is making. If that person could prove to a court that you were not 
mentally competent when you made the power of attorney, the 
power of attorney would be declared invalid from the beginning. A 
challenge is much less likely if you had a lawyer help you prepare 
and sign the document because a lawyer wouldn’t ordinarily let 
you sign if you weren’t right in the head.
The document must be signed and witnessed
A power of attorney has to be properly signed and witnessed, just as 
a will does. (We describe how a will must be signed in Chapter 13.) 

 Chapter 14: Powers of Attorney: Who’ll Manage Your Money? 249
In most provinces, two witnesses must be present when the prin-
cipal signs the document and then the witnesses must also sign 
the document. The principal and the witnesses must all be present 
together to watch each other sign. (In some provinces, only one 
witness is required.) In some provinces, the witnesses may have to 
swear before a commissioner or a notary public that they are the 
witnesses.
The purpose of these rules is to make sure that no one is forging the
principal’s name on the power of attorney, or sneakily getting 
the principal to give a power of attorney without knowing it, or 
forcing the principal to give the power of attorney against his 
or her will.
The witnesses must be eligible
 
Anyone who witnesses the signing of a power of attorney has to be 
eligible to be a witness. In almost all provinces, the witnesses must 
not be the attorney, the attorney’s spouse, the principal’s spouse, 
or the principal’s child. Further, in some provinces only specified 
people such as judges, justices of the peace, lawyers, and doctors 
can act as witnesses.
The purpose of this rule is to make sure that the witnesses 
don’t have their own stake in creating the power of attorney. 
Independent witnesses presumably won’t help anyone to forge a 
power of attorney or force the principal to sign a document against 
his or her will.
The attorney needs to know when it’s time to take over
Finally, the attorney may need a lawyer’s help to decide when the 
power of attorney can be used.
 
In provinces where the power of attorney comes into effect as 
soon as it’s signed, the principal may want to instruct his or her 
lawyer to hold the power of attorney document and not give it to 
the attorney until the principal is mentally incapable. Then the 
attorney needs to know when to call up the lawyer and ask for the 
document. This is a matter you and your attorney should discuss 
with your lawyer.
In provinces where the power of attorney can come into effect 
when a particular event happens, the principal may state that the 
event is mental incapacity. Again, the attorney may need to talk to 
a lawyer to decide whether the event has happened. The principal 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
250
may even have stipulated that his or her lawyer should decide 
when it has happened (the usual alternative is to have the princi-
pal’s doctor decide).
If the power of attorney is intended to come into effect when the 
principal becomes mentally incompetent and the document says 
nothing about how it’s to be determined that the principal is 
incompetent, the attorney may need a lawyer’s assistance to find 
out what the provincial law says about determining incompetence. 
In some provinces two doctors are needed to give evidence, in 
others a court has to review the evidence and make a decision.
Knowing What to Do After the 
Power of Attorney Has Been 
Prepared
After preparing the power of attorney document, the principal 
should tell the attorney where the original document is being kept.
 
Don’t keep your power of attorney in your safety deposit box! 
Your attorney may not be able to get into the box without having a 
power of attorney document to show the bank!
If the principal has confidence in the attorney’s ability to decide 
when the principal is mentally incapable, the principal can even 
give the attorney the document to keep until it’s needed. If the 
principal decides not to give the document to the attorney but to 
someone else to hold, the principal should give the holder written 
instructions that set out when the document should be given to 
the attorney. It’s common for a principal to leave the document 
with his or her lawyer.
The principal can leave written instructions for the attorney along 
with the power of attorney document. In the instructions, the 
principal can tell the attorney how to exercise the powers given. 
For example, the principal who gives a general power of attorney 
could say that certain investments should not be cashed, or that a 
vacation property should be sold first if money is needed, or that 
the attorney should consult with family members before taking 
any action. The attorney doesn’t have to follow these instructions 
(unlike restrictions written into the power of attorney document 
itself), but the attorney may find it very useful to have some idea of 
the principal’s wishes.

 Chapter 14: Powers of Attorney: Who’ll Manage Your Money? 251
Investigating What Happens When 
Your Attorney Takes Over
When an attorney wants to exercise the powers given by the prin-
cipal, he or she has to show the original power of attorney docu-
ment. The attorney may also be asked to show identification to 
prove he or she is the person named in the power of attorney.
 
The attorney may be asked to hand over the power of attorney — a 
business may want to keep it on file for its own protection, nervous
that it’s not dealing with the principal in person. An attorney should 
never, ever give the original to someone else. The attorney can’t 
act without it! A photocopy or a notarized copy (a copy certified 
identical to the original by a notary public) is good enough for 
giveaways.
The duties of an attorney
Sure you trust your attorney — but you may be just a little bit 
relieved anyway to hear that your attorney can’t run amok and do 
whatever he or she likes. By law, your attorney must always act 
honestly and in your best interests, must be reasonably careful in 
making and carrying out decisions, must avoid having any conflict 
of interest with you, must not make any secret profit from handling 
your affairs, and must keep records of all transactions.
You can impose additional duties on your attorney by mentioning 
them in the power of attorney document itself.
Discovering What Happens 
to Your Finances without 
a Power of Attorney
If you don’t get around to making a power of attorney before your 
mind takes early retirement — or if you made one but someone 
goofed and it wasn’t a continuing power of attorney, so it ended the 
moment you lost your mental competence and your legal ability to 
make a new power of attorney — your legal and financial affairs 
won’t be completely screwed up . . . but close.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
252
Others will be able to make certain kinds of arrangements to 
look after your affairs, but none of them will be as good as the 
arrangements you could have made yourself by creating a power 
of attorney. Your family or friends can create informal or formal 
mechanisms or, if everyone you know simply steps back a pace 
when the call goes out for volunteers, the provincial government 
can take care of your affairs.
 
It’s tempting, but . . . about the worst thing your family or friends 
could do if you became mentally incompetent would be to get you 
to sign a power of attorney. Even if their intentions are good and 
they want to use the power of attorney only to make necessary 
arrangements that you would approve of, any action an attorney 
took could later be challenged in court and cancelled. The attorney 
(and any others who cooked up the idea) could also end up being 
sued by the people he or she dealt with using the power of attor-
ney, and could perhaps even be charged criminally.
Seat-of-the-pants arrangements
Making informal arrangements to deal with complicated legal and 
financial affairs isn’t possible, but maybe something can be cobbled 
together to keep you from starving to death. For example, anyone 
can deposit cheques payable to you in your bank account. The trick 
will be getting any money out of your bank account — let’s hope you 
had opened a joint account with someone even though you were 
too busy to make a power of attorney. If you didn’t, the most likely 
informal arrangement is that a family member will pay your bills out 
of his or her own pocket, or that no one will pay your bills and the 
lights will go out and the heat will go off.
 
If some of your income is courtesy of the Canada Pension Plan, 
Guaranteed Income Supplement, Veterans Affairs Canada, or Old Age 
Security, a family member can apply to the Canadian government 
to be appointed as a trustee to receive the benefits. The person 
appointed as trustee will be able to cash your cheques.
Formal arrangements
The only way a family member can look after your affairs (which 
now include looking after you) properly without a power of attor-
ney is to get appointed by the court as your property guardian or 
committee (stress on the “ee” not the “mitt” — you can be this kind 
of committee without being a group). The name used depends on 
the province.

 Chapter 14: Powers of Attorney: Who’ll Manage Your Money? 253
Getting appointed as a property guardian or committee is a big 
nuisance (think collecting a lot of information, finding doctors, 
notifying a whole bunch of people, getting consents, swearing affi-
davits, appearing at a court hearing, paying legal fees, and posting 
security with the court), and even if the court grants the appoint-
ment it may give very limited powers. In some provinces your 
property guardian would have to pay into court any of your money 
not needed to meet your expenses and those of your dependants. 
(Then the money would stay there until the court gave permis-
sion for your property guardian to take some out.) Your property 
guardian probably wouldn’t be allowed to sell any of your invest-
ments or your real estate without getting court approval first. And 
the court probably wouldn’t give its approval unless a sale was 
necessary to pay your expenses.
Government arrangements
If no one wants to apply to be your property guardian, remember 
there’s always someone to fall back on who will take care of your 
affairs — your provincial government. Doesn’t that give you a 
warm glow of happiness? Particularly considering how often you’ve 
remarked to yourself and others that your provincial government 
does such a darned good job of running the province generally.
 
The public trustee or public guardian and trustee (depending on 
the province) can be called in to take over your affairs if you can’t 
manage them. When someone notifies the public trustee about 
you and your property, the public trustee can make an application 
to court to be made your property guardian. (In most provinces, 
the public trustee can also be brought in without a court hearing 
if you have been certified mentally incapable by medical experts.) 
Even after the public trustee has been appointed, one of your rela-
tives could still take pity on you and apply to have the trusteeship 
ended and to be made your property guardian.
Once in charge, the public trustee will take control of your prop-
erty, receive your income, pay your expenses, and hold in trust 
money you don’t need immediately (it will be invested — safely — 
to generate interest). The public trustee charges a fee for its work.
When you die, your estate doesn’t just stay in the government’s 
hands. It’s distributed according to your will, if you have one, or 
the provincial law on intestacy (see Chapter 12), if you don’t.

n Chapter 14 we tell you what to do so that your legal and financial 
affairs will be properly managed if you become unable to look 
after them yourself. In this chapter we deal with a matter that’s just 
as important. If you can’t look after your affairs, you probably can’t 
look after yourself either. So who’s going to look after you?
Canada has universal health care. So you don’t really have to 
worry about making plans to get access to health care. The thing 
you have to worry about is telling health care workers what you 
want. If you’re sick or injured . . . or dying . . . you may not be 
physically or mentally capable of telling anyone your wishes. When 
that time comes it may turn out that you don’t care what happens 
to you. But you probably care now — so this is when you should 
make your arrangements for a second-in-command who’ll speak for 
you and tell everyone what you would say if you could.
Understanding the Importance of 
Consent in Medical Treatment
Before you can receive any health care you have to give your 
consent. If you don’t give your consent, a doctor or other health 
care worker can’t treat you.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
256
Giving consent isn’t a big deal — you’ve probably given your 
consent to treatment dozens of times without realizing it. When 
you go to your doctor’s office or the emergency room and roll 
up your sleeve when the doctor says, “I’m going to give you an 
antibiotic shot,” that’s giving your implied consent. When you tell 
your doctor, “I’d like you to remove this wart,” that’s oral consent 
to treatment. You may also have given consent in writing if you’ve 
ever had surgery in a hospital. You would have been asked to sign 
a consent form when you were admitted.
In order to give consent, you have to be conscious and you have to 
be in your right mind. Hmm, you’re now wondering, not everyone 
who needs medical treatment is awake and rational — that could 
pose a bit of a problem. No need to worry however, because in an 
emergency situation a doctor or other health care worker has the 
right, without getting the consent of the patient or anyone else, to 
give treatment that is urgently needed to save the person’s life or 
maintain the person’s health. If a family member is present, the 
doctor or other professional might consult with him or her, but it’s 
not a legal requirement.
In a non-emergency situation, a doctor or other health care worker 
has to get consent from you — or if you can’t give consent, from 
someone acting on your behalf — before giving treatment or car-
rying out a procedure. Generally, the patient’s closest relative, in a 
stated order (spouse first, then an adult child, then a parent, then 
a brother or sister), has the power to give consent if the patient 
has not made formal arrangements to appoint someone to give 
consent on his or her behalf.
 
It is a tort, a civil wrong, for any person to touch another person 
without the touchee’s permission. The touchee can sue the 
toucher for the tort of batter and get an award of money damages. 
So the reason a doctor (or nurse, etc.) can’t provide health care 
without your consent is that the doctor doesn’t want to get sued 
later. Doctors in Canada in fact have been sued and have lost and 
have had to pay compensation for giving necessary or even life-
saving treatment to patients who did not want the treatment.
Reviewing the Law Regarding 
Consent to Treatment
 
In all provinces, a person over the age of majority (18 or 19, 
depending on the province) can legally consent to treatment or 
refuse treatment if he or she is able to understand information 
relevant to making a medical decision and is able to appreciate 

 Chapter 15: Living Wills 257
what is likely to happen as a result of making the decision. In most 
provinces, an older child who can appreciate the nature and con-
sequences of medical treatment also has the right to consent to or 
refuse treatment. A parent of a younger child has the right to give 
consent or refuse treatment on behalf of the child.
In order to give true consent, known in the health biz as informed 
consent, the patient has to be given enough information about the 
proposed treatment to be able to make a reasonable decision. So 
the doctor (or other health care worker) has to tell the patient, 
without having to be asked,
 
✓ What the nature of the proposed treatment is.
 
✓ What the significant risks of the treatment are.
 
✓ Whether there are any alternatives to the proposed treatment, 
and what they are.
 
✓ What is likely to happen if the patient does not receive the 
treatment.
The doctor must also answer any other questions that the 
patient has.
The legal ability to give or refuse consent to treatment can come and 
go. A person could be capable of giving consent during a meeting 
with his or her doctor to discuss surgery, but incapable of giving 
consent while unconscious during the surgery and semi-conscious 
following the surgery. During those times, a patient might need 
someone to give or refuse consent on his or her behalf.
 
You can refuse consent when you can’t otherwise communicate by 
wearing a medical alert bracelet or keeping a written message with 
you. For example, for religious reasons some people carry a card 
in their wallet saying “No blood transfusion.” Health care workers 
have to respect this refusal (even if not giving the treatment would 
lead to your death).
Looking at Treatments 
That Require Consent
Your consent is required for all kinds of treatments. You can’t receive 
a flu shot or have a blood sample taken or have your appendix 
removed or be given a physical examination without consent. 
In fact, unless it’s an emergency, you can’t be treated — or even 
touched — at all without consent. So the kind of treatment we’re 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
258
talking about includes routine matters like a checkup or vaccination, 
and out-of-the-ordinary matters like surgery, radiation, or 
chemotherapy.
We’re also talking about treatment at the end of life — treatment 
that will keep you alive or at least hold death at bay, or that will 
make death easier.
 
A patient who is competent to give or refuse consent can refuse 
treatment that would save or prolong his or her life. The patient 
can also refuse to continue with treatment that has already been 
started. If a doctor disagrees with a competent patient’s wishes, 
the patient wins.
Treatment that prolongs life
Some of the treatments that a patient may receive to save or pro-
long his or her life, or stop death for some period of time, are sur-
gery, blood transfusion, dialysis (machine cleaning of the blood if 
the kidneys fail), administration of drugs (for example, antibiotics 
to fight an infection such as pneumonia), and tube feeding (via a 
tube inserted into the stomach or abdomen). There’s also CPR and 
use of a ventilator.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
CPR is used to try to restart heartbeat and breathing when they 
have stopped. When CPR is administered in hospitals, trained 
health care workers press on the chest and apply shocks to the 
heart to restart it; and they insert a tube down the throat into the 
windpipe and connect it to a ventilator to supply air to the lungs. 
Then drugs may be required to help the heart pump harder because 
blood pressure has fallen. You certainly won’t feel great before you 
get CPR, but you won’t feel so hot afterwards either.
If you ever happen to need CPR, it’s not an optional kind of thing. If 
you need it and don’t get it, you’ll die. But if you get it, it won’t nec-
essarily save your life. In about 40 percent of cases it works well 
enough to get the patient as far as intensive care — but only about 
a third of those patients live to leave the hospital.
In many hospitals, CPR is given automatically to any patient whose 
heart and breathing stop. For some people, automatic CPR is a 
good thing. For others, it’s a bad thing. If you’re in the final stages 
of a terminal disease, or you’ve suffered very severe brain damage 
in an accident or as the result of a stroke, dying is probably the 
best course of action for you. You don’t want to be CPR’d back to 
life so you can die again (and possibly be revived again) half an 

 Chapter 15: Living Wills 259
hour or half a day later, or so you can hang around in a permanent 
coma for a while.
In hospitals where CPR is automatic, a patient’s doctor may ask the 
patient or the patient’s family in advance to refuse it if it wouldn’t 
benefit the patient. The doctor would ask for consent to putting an 
order DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) or a no code (same thing) or “No 
CPR” on the patient’s chart.
Ventilators
If a patient’s lungs have been damaged by disease or injury, a ven-
tilator can be used to help the patient breathe or to breathe for 
the patient. If the lung damage is bad enough, the patient will die 
if ever taken off the ventilator. A ventilator is uncomfortable, and 
patients are often sedated to be able to tolerate it.
A person being kept alive by a ventilator may have such a poor 
quality of life that he or she, or a family member acting on the 
person’s behalf, may ask to have the ventilator disconnected. Or 
a doctor may recommend that it be disconnected because the use 
of the ventilator is only stretching out the dying process and not 
providing a real benefit. (This is where the expression “pulling the 
plug” comes from.)
Treatment that eases death
Treatment that makes death easier includes withholding the vari-
ous treatments mentioned above — because in some cases they 
don’t prolong life, they just prolong dying — and comfort care.
Comfort care involves giving morphine in a high enough dose that 
the dying person does not suffer (from pain or from the sensation 
of suffocating if the respiratory system is failing) while dying. It’s 
not always automatically given even when it’s needed.
 
Patients sometimes need an advocate on hand not just to consent 
to comfort care but to demand it.
Making Your Wishes Known
If you’re conscious and mentally capable, you make your wishes 
about medical treatment known by telling your doctor and/or family 
what you want. If you can’t speak you may have to write your wishes. 
If you can’t speak or write you may have to talk with your eyes.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
260
 
If you’re not fully conscious or not mentally capable, the way to 
make your wishes known is by having prepared a living will while 
you were conscious and capable. A living will lets an earlier, men-
tally capable, version of yourself speak through another person 
when the later version of you can’t.
A living will can do two things:
 
✓ It can appoint someone to make health care decisions for you.
 
✓ It can tell the appointed decision maker what decisions you 
would like made.
In some provinces, a living will is intended to deal with medical 
treatment only. In others, it can also deal with personal care decisions 
about things like housing, food, hygiene, clothing, or safety. You can 
find out more about living wills in your province from your lawyer, 
your provincial law society, or provincial government.
A living will comes into effect only when you’re not mentally capable 
of giving consent to or refusing medical treatment. Living wills are 
legally recognized in all provinces and the instructions in a living 
will must be followed. They override the wishes of a patient’s 
family, in the same way that the wishes of a mentally competent 
patient override the wishes of the patient’s family.
 
It would be too much to ask all the provinces to get together and use 
the same vocabulary about living wills. So almost every province has
a different name for a living will. Depending on the province, the living 
will may be called a personal directive, a representation agreement, a 
health care directive, an advance health care directive, a power of 
attorney for personal care, a mandate, or a directive.
Also depending on the province the appointed decision maker may 
be called an attorney for personal care, a proxy, an agent, a represen-
tative, a substitute decision maker, or a mandatary. In our discussion 
we’ll refer to a living will and a substitute decision maker.
Investigating what a 
living will covers
The living will form is different in different provinces, but generally 
you’ll find that the form covers several standard points.

 Chapter 15: Living Wills 261
A living will names the person who will speak for you
Some people appoint just one substitute decision maker to make 
decisions on their behalf. Others appoint two or more decision 
makers, usually to make sure that someone will be available when 
needed rather than to create a safeguard against one person making 
the wrong decision. If you appoint more than one substitute decision 
maker but want one person to be able to act alone if a decision has 
to be made quickly, your living will should say that any substitute 
decision maker can make a decision individually. But if you want 
group decisions in case they’re safer, the living will should say that 
the substitute decision makers must agree on all decisions.
Some people appoint a back-up substitute decision maker in case 
the original substitute decision maker can’t or won’t act. This is 
probably wise, because you can’t know what the future holds for 
your substitute decision maker any more than you can know what 
it holds for you.
Later in the chapter we talk about who is eligible to act as your 
substitute decision maker.
A living will may cancel a previous living will
When you make a living will and name a substitute decision maker 
and give instructions about your health care, you normally want to 
revoke or cancel any previous living will you made. After all, you’re 
making a new one because you’ve changed your mind about what 
you want done or whom you want to decide on your behalf.
A living will may list what health care 
decisions can be made
If provincial law allows a variety of decisions to be made by a sub-
stitute decision maker, a living will could give power to make all 
health care decisions, or (for example) power only to make decisions 
about medical treatment or power only to make decisions about food, 
safety, and hygiene.
A living will gives instructions about health care treatment
If you live in a province that allows you to give a substitute deci-
sion maker the power to make decisions about different aspects 
of your health care, you could give a variety of instructions. You 
could say for example, that if possible you would prefer to be 
cared for at home instead of in a hospital or nursing home. You 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
262
could say that you’d like to be cared for in your daughter’s home 
rather than your son’s. You could say that you want to be bathed 
daily, and that you want to be dressed instead of being left in pyja-
mas. You could say that if you develop a tendency to wander and 
get lost you would prefer to have a caregiver with you at all times 
rather than being restrained in a locked area or a chair or bed with 
straps. You can give instructions about anything that concerns you 
or occurs to you. Whether it will be possible to carry out your 
instructions when the time comes is a question for another day.
The instructions you give about medical treatment are a different 
matter. They tend to be geared less toward everyday life and more 
toward the question of how long you want to live and in what state. 
Your substitute decision maker is not going to have a lot of trouble 
deciding to consent to routine maintenance for you. You don’t 
need to sweat over giving instructions to have your blood pressure 
taken by the nurse in a nursing home.
Your instructions to the substitute decision maker about medical 
treatment could be very general — for example, you could instruct 
that you don’t want any treatment that
 
✓ Will not cure you, and
 
✓ Will not improve your quality of life if it prolongs your life.
Or your instructions could be more specific — for example, that 
you don’t want to be put on a ventilator or given CPR if you are in 
a permanent coma or vegetative state and suffer respiratory failure 
or heart failure. In fact, your instructions can be even more specific 
than that. You could run down a list of injuries and diseases and 
state in each case what treatment you would or would not consent 
to. That might be kind of a fun thing to do on a rainy afternoon.
 
If you’re specific in your instructions, you’d better say how much 
discretion your substitute decision maker has to make a different 
decision. You may not want to miss out on a new medical treat-
ment that could have you back on your feet in no time flat, or you 
may prefer not to be given experimental treatment that would be 
unpleasant but would provide little permanent benefit.
A living will may give instructions about 
organ and tissue donation
Your instructions to your substitute decision maker can also 
include your wishes for organ and tissue donation. You should know, 
however, that if you give advance consent to organ or tissue 
donation and members of your family are opposed when the time 
comes, the hospital will probably not accept your donation.

 Chapter 15: Living Wills 263
Making a living will
 
You can fill out a do-it-yourself form to make a living will. You don’t 
have to have a lawyer (or, in Quebec, a notary). However, we think 
it’s better to have a living will prepared by a lawyer. A lawyer will 
act as an objective person who can help you decide what instruc-
tions you want to leave and who can help you choose the best 
person to be the substitute decision maker. In addition, a lawyer 
won’t forget to use any special language that the province wants in 
a living will.
A lawyer will also make sure that you are legally capable of making 
a living will, that your substitute decision maker is legally eligible 
to act, and that any special formalities in the making or signing of 
the document are observed.
You have to be legally capable of making a living will
In some provinces you can make a living will if you are as young as 
16, while in others you must have reached the age of majority (18 
or 19, depending on the province).
To make a valid living will you must also be mentally capable. In 
some provinces this means that you must be able to “understand 
the nature and effect” of the living will, and in others that you must 
be able to “make health care decisions by being able to understand 
and appreciate the consequences of treatment choices.”
Not everyone is eligible to be a substitute decision maker
Not a lot of qualifications are required for a substitute decision 
maker. In some provinces a person as young as 16 can be named 
a substitute decision maker, while in others the person must have 
reached the age of majority (18 or 19, depending on the province).
The substitute decision maker, just like a patient who gives con-
sent, must be mentally capable of understanding and appreciating 
the consequences of medical treatment choices and decisions. The 
substitute decision maker has to be mentally capable when called 
upon to act. That’s one reason that naming more than one substi-
tute decision maker, or naming an alternate, may be a good idea.
 
In Ontario, a person who is being paid to provide health care 
or residential, social, training, or support services for a person 
cannot be appointed as that person’s substitute decision maker, 
unless the person is the grantor’s spouse, partner or relative.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
264
 
Whom should you choose as your substitute decision maker? First, 
go for someone you feel confident will carry out your wishes. 
Second, choose someone who isn’t going to feel devastated and 
guilty if he or she has to make a non-life-affirming decision about 
you. Discuss your wishes in advance not only with your chosen 
substitute decision maker but also with your whole family so that 
your decision maker will be supported rather than attacked by 
your (other) relatives.
Formalities involved in making a living will
You have to sign and date your living will. (If you’re physically 
unable to sign, someone else may sign on your behalf.) Some prov-
inces don’t require that a living will be witnessed unless it was 
signed by someone on your behalf, while others require one wit-
ness or even two witnesses (depending on the province) to your 
signature. Again, ask your lawyer or check with your provincial law 
society or provincial government for more information.
In cases when a witness is (or witnesses are) required, the substi-
tute decision maker cannot be a witness. Neither can the spouse 
of the person making the living will or the spouse of the substitute 
decision maker. The purpose of these rules is to prevent a person 
from being forced to make a living will or being forced to choose 
a particular substitute decision maker. The theory is that this sort 
of thing is less likely to happen if the living will is witnessed by 
people who have a little distance from the person making the living 
will and from the proposed substitute decision maker.
In some provinces, the living will is not effective unless the substi-
tute decision maker agrees in writing. In British Columbia, a living 
will must be registered, and in Quebec it must be verified by the 
court, before it has any effect.
Knowing what to do after 
you’ve made a living will
Making a living will won’t be of any use if nobody knows what 
it says or can find it when it’s needed. Your substitute decision 
maker could have a lot of trouble persuading your doctor or the 
hospital that he or she has the right to make decisions without the 
living will to show. Once you’ve made a living will, give the original 
to the substitute decision maker — or at the very least tell the sub-
stitute decision maker where to find the original.

 Chapter 15: Living Wills 265
 
Put the original of your living will in a safe place, but do not put it 
in your safety deposit box! Chances are that your substitute deci-
sion maker wouldn’t be able to get into your box after you became 
either physically or mentally incapable.
Give a copy of your living will to your doctor(s) for the record. You 
may also want to give copies to other family members and/or your 
lawyer.
 
If you’re suffering from a particular disease or condition, make sure 
that you and your substitute decision maker understand how the 
disease or condition is likely to progress, what the available treat-
ment options are, what they involve, and whether they’re likely to 
be successful. Keep up to date on what medical treatment is avail-
able. You may want to revise your living will to give different instruc-
tions if there are significant advances in treatment. And don’t forget 
to revise your living will if something happens to your substitute 
decision maker.
Understanding What Happens 
When Your Living Will 
Comes into Effect
Your living will comes into effect only when you become incapable 
of making a medical decision. It will probably be a health care 
worker — probably a doctor — who raises the red flag about your 
mental abilities and asks for someone else to come forward to give 
consent to treatment on your behalf.
When your substitute decision maker is brought in, in most prov-
inces he or she has to follow the instructions in your living will 
rather than making a decision based on his or her own prefer-
ences. In some provinces, the substitute decision maker can con-
sider your instructions but has the power to make his or her own 
decision.
If your living will doesn’t contain instructions that cover the situ-
ation the substitute decision maker is faced with, the substitute 
decision maker is supposed to follow any wishes you expressed 
before you became incapable, if they’re known. If you didn’t express 
any wishes, the substitute decision maker is supposed to think 
about what decision you would have made in the circumstances 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
266
and base his or her decision on that. If the substitute decision 
maker really has no clue what you would have decided, he or she 
is supposed to base his or her decision on the nature of the medi-
cal treatment that’s being proposed. Will the treatment improve or 
maintain your quality of life? And are the benefits of the proposed 
treatment greater than its risks?
Considering Possible Arrangements 
if You Haven’t Made a Living Will
If you don’t have a living will, you don’t have a substitute decision 
maker. You also don’t have a substitute decision maker if the one 
you’ve named in your living will can’t or won’t act. In either event, 
provincial law will find one for you.
Finding a substitute decision maker
Your healthcare provider will ask one of your family members to 
give consent or refuse treatment on your behalf. Generally, the 
first person to be asked will be your spouse. If you don’t have 
one, your adult child will be asked. If you have no adult children 
a parent will be asked, and if you’ve run out of parents an adult 
brother or sister can be asked. After that they’ll turn to your clos-
est adult next of kin. They won’t go looking all over creation for 
next of kin, though.
If you need to be treated and you don’t have any relatives who are 
interested enough in you to introduce themselves to the doctor, 
the doctor and/or hospital will contact the public trustee or public 
trustee and guardian of the province. The public trustee will make 
decisions on your behalf.
Even if you don’t have a living will, anyone who gives or refuses 
consent on your behalf is supposed to follow your known wishes, 
not his or her own wishes. If the person doesn’t remember you 
expressing any wishes about the matter, he or she is supposed to 
do what he or she believes you would do if you could express your 
wishes. If that approach fails, the family member giving consent on 
your behalf is supposed to consider whether the proposed treat-
ment will improve or maintain your quality of life, and whether the 
benefits of the proposed treatment outweigh the risks.

 Chapter 15: Living Wills 267
 
If you’ve given no instructions about organ and tissue donation (in 
your living will, on the donor consent card available through the 
provincial driver’s licensing department, or orally in front of two 
witnesses), your family members have the right to give or refuse 
consent at the time of your death. They’ll be asked in the follow-
ing order: your spouse, your adult child, your parent, your adult 
brother or sister, any other adult next of kin. If the highest person 
on the list says no, the doctor or hospital can’t go further down the 
list looking for a different answer. If the highest person says yes 
but someone else who is also high on the list says no, the hospital 
probably won’t accept the donation.
Appointing a guardian of the person
If you don’t have a living will, or if your living will covers only 
medical treatment and informal arrangements to look after you are 
breaking down, more action may be needed in order to take care 
of you properly. One of your relatives (or a friend) can apply to 
the court to be appointed your guardian of the person. If you have 
no concerned relatives or friends, the provincial public trustee or 
public trustee and guardian can apply to be appointed your guard-
ian of the person.
What can a guardian of the person do for you?
In some provinces, the guardian of the person will be given cus-
tody of you — that’s right, just like you were a little kid. Then your 
guardian of the person has the same rights that a parent would 
have over a child.
In a few provinces, the powers of a guardian of the person are 
instead listed in detail. Then they include the power to decide
 
✓  Where you should live, and with whom.
 
✓ What health care you should have.
 
✓ What food you should eat.
 
✓ What social activities you should get involved in.
However the court order is worded, your guardian of the person 
will be responsible for your care. Your guardian will have to act in 
your best interests, make reasonable arrangements for your care, 
and be reasonably careful in making decisions about your care.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
268
How do you acquire a guardian of the person?
 
A person who wants to be appointed your guardian of the person 
has to go through the same process as a person who wanted to be 
your property guardian or committee. (See Chapter 14.) He or she 
will have to get doctors to give evidence about your condition
and will have to notify your relatives of the application to be made 
guardian, get consent (or proof of lack of interest) from the rela-
tives, swear an affidavit, and possibly appear in court before a 
judge.
If the court agrees that you’re in need of care and protection because 
you’re mentally incompetent to make health care decisions or inca-
pable of caring for yourself, it will appoint a guardian of the person. If 
you’ve already got a property guardian, the court will probably prefer 
to appoint that person as your guardian of the person.

T
o plan your estate properly and carry out the plan by pre-
paring a will and other legal documents, you need a team of 
advisers. Some of these advisers are professionals (with accredited 
training), such as lawyers, others aren’t, such as financial planners. 
(Even the non-professionals often have professional-sounding 
designations.) Some of them offer unbiased professional advice, 
others are just glorified salespeople. How many, if any, of these 
advisers do you need?
In this chapter, we fill you in on how to build your estate planning 
team.
Understanding Why and 
When You Need a Lawyer
Lawyers are expensive, right? It’s better to look for a cheaper alter-
native, right? Wrong! Not having a lawyer prepare your will can 
cost a lot.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
270
This isn’t to say that a little self-help isn’t a good thing. Before you 
go to see a lawyer, check around and get free or inexpensive legal 
information about wills and estates — from government Web sites 
(or general information Web sites, or even business promotion 
Web sites) or from books. But just remember that the information 
you get from sources like these is not tailored to your specific 
circumstances. And neither are any documents you buy in a kit or 
download from the Internet. Lawyers like to say that a single fact 
can change an entire case.
 
Free legal advice and free legal documents are often worth exactly 
what you paid for them, and sometimes they turn out to be far 
more expensive than you dreamed.
In many provinces there are non-lawyers who offer legal services —
and will drafting is quite often one of the services they offer. You 
might think it would be really clever to go to a paralegal, legal 
consultant, or legal services provider (they call themselves different 
things), because they’re usually cheaper than lawyers.
However, in every province, paralegals are legally allowed to do 
only a limited number of things, and preparing wills is not one of 
them. If you’ve seen an advertisement for a paralegal who does will 
preparation, it’s because the law prohibiting them from doing wills 
is not being enforced.
Should you use a paralegal then? In a word — no.
Don’t be afraid to go to a lawyer because you think it will bankrupt 
you. Lawyers deliberately keep the cost of preparing a will down. 
Lawyers often look on wills as a kind of “loss leader.” They don’t 
expect to make money on the will — they hope to make their profit 
on other legal work you’ll ask them to do once you get to know and 
love them, or on the administration of your estate after you die. 
Very often the executor of the estate asks the lawyer who prepared 
the will to help with probating the will and to advise on other mat-
ters that arise.
Still not convinced that you need a lawyer? Here are some of the 
situations in which a lawyer would be really useful.
When you’re planning your 
estate and your will
While you’re in the planning stages, your lawyer will be able to 
help you prepare a complete estate plan that answers all your 

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 271
needs by taking you through the foreseeable possibilities about 
your future and your family’s future. Many people who go through 
the estate planning process without professional assistance don’t 
ask “What if . . .” enough times, and they end up with an incomplete 
plan that breaks down. Lawyers are great What-ifers.
As well, your lawyer can
 
✓ Sort out the tax consequences of leaving certain kinds of gifts 
to certain kinds of beneficiaries.
 
✓ Help you decide whether to give gifts while you’re still alive or 
wait to give your property away by will.
 
✓ Advise about the best way of making gifts in your lifetime.
 
✓ Tell you whether you have dependants you must provide for 
in your will.
 
✓ Tell you if you must leave at least a minimum gift to your 
spouse in your will.
 
✓ Tell you whether you must make a gift to someone as a result 
of an agreement or a promise you made.
When you start to put 
your plan into action
When you’re ready to go into action, your lawyer can
 
✓ Take the necessary legal steps to help you make a valid gift 
while you’re alive, including such steps as putting property 
(real estate, for example) into joint ownership.
 
✓ Draft a will using language that will make sure your real inten-
tions are carried out.
 
✓ Get the necessary information about a charity you want to 
benefit in your will.
 
✓ Draft a power of attorney that suits your needs and a living 
will that reflects your wishes.
 
✓ Help you choose an attorney or a substitute decision maker 
who is legally eligible to fill the position.
 
✓ Explain all the legal concepts and technical language that 
you’ll run into in a will, power of attorney, or (to a lesser 
extent) a living will.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
272
When it comes time to 
put pen to paper
When you’re ready to sign all the important documents, your 
lawyer will
 
✓ Make a professional judgment about whether you are mentally 
capable of making a will, a power of attorney, or a living will. 
If your mental state is later called into question, your lawyer 
will be able to give evidence that you were legally capable of 
creating these documents.
 
✓ Make sure that you sign the documents properly.
 
✓ Choose as witnesses people who are legally eligible to witness 
you sign the documents.
 
✓ Make sure that special requirements about the witnessing of 
your signature are met.
 
✓ Have the witnesses sign the necessary additional documents 
that may be required to get your will probated.
After you’re gone
Your estate and your executor will need a lawyer to
 
✓ Get your will probated.
 
✓ Provide help on request with preparing terminal tax returns 
and estate tax returns and dealing with Canada Revenue.
 
✓ Set up long-term trusts.
 
✓ Transfer property from your name to the name of the estate 
and eventually into the names of the beneficiaries.
Knowing what type of 
lawyer you want
Now you’re convinced. You need a lawyer. But which one? In this 
section we help you decide.

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 273
A lawyer who knows something 
about wills and estates
 
The lawyer you want is one who’s already experienced in estate 
planning and drafting wills. You don’t want to provide some lawyer 
with on-the-job training.
You may be able to find that experienced lawyer right around the 
corner. Sole practitioners (lawyers working alone) and lawyers in 
very small firms (two or three lawyers) often carry on a general 
practice, for example, a combination of real estate, some family law, 
and wills and estates. These lawyers often know quite a lot about wills 
and estates. They can usually be found in convenient locations — your 
neighbourhood rather than downtown. A sole practitioner or small 
firm is a good place to start when it’s time to get personalized legal 
advice about estate planning and your will. If your estate is straight-
forward, you’ll stick with the sole practitioner through the whole 
process. If you turn out to have complications — say if you need 
high-powered advice about taxes, trusts, or business succession 
plans — your lawyer can refer you to a specialist.
Lawyers in medium-sized and big firms do wills and estates work 
too. Wills and estates lawyers in the really big firms usually work 
with clients who are wealthy and require mega-help with their 
estate plans in order to keep taxes down. So these lawyers tend to 
be specialists in areas that most people don’t need extra-strength 
advice in. In a medium-sized firm you might find a specialist or you 
might find someone with a general practice just like a lawyer in a 
very small firm. It just depends on the lawyer and the firm.
 
The only real way to find out whether a lawyer knows enough or 
too much about wills and estates is to interview the lawyer.
A lawyer you like . . . 
or at least don’t loathe
You could end up spending a fair amount of time with your lawyer. 
It’ll feel even longer if you don’t think much of him — so don’t hesi-
tate to choose a lawyer at least partly on the basis of your feelings.
You want a lawyer who passes the competence test with you. You 
may not be able to judge whether a lawyer is working right up to 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
274
the standard of other capable lawyers in this area of law, but you’ll 
probably be able to tell if she is just bluffing.
You should also feel confident about your lawyer’s honesty and 
integrity. If “honesty and integrity” aren’t the words that come into 
your mind when you chat with a lawyer, but “slimeball” pops up, 
this isn’t the lawyer for you. This is really a matter of instinct.
You want a lawyer you feel you can talk to freely. It’s important to 
be able to say whatever’s on your mind — it doesn’t work to keep 
your lawyer in the dark about any aspect of your legal situation. 
Clients generally get more personal contact with a lawyer who’s a 
sole practitioner or a member of a small firm. In a larger firm, you’ll 
still get personal contact, but it may be with secretaries, clerks, 
and junior lawyers rather than mainly with your chosen lawyer. If 
it looks like you’re going to be dealing with other people as much 
as with your lawyer, take your feelings about them into account 
too when you’re deciding on a lawyer.
Finding the Lawyer for You
Finding a good lawyer isn’t rocket science, but it may involve some 
leg work. We suggest that you follow the steps that we outline in 
this section.
Get recommendations
When you’re looking for recommendations for a lawyer,
 
✓ Ask friends, relatives, or business associates for the names of 
lawyers who have done similar work for them. Don’t just get the 
names — ask what they liked and disliked about their lawyers.
 
✓ Call a community legal clinic for suggestions.
 
✓ Contact your provincial law society for lawyers in your area 
who specialize in wills and estates.
Investigate
Unless you have absolute confidence in the judgment of the person 
who recommended a lawyer to you, don’t just decide to go to the 
first lawyer mentioned to you. Narrow your list of possibilities by
 
✓ Finding out more about each lawyer’s firm. If your estate is 
complicated, maybe you shouldn’t be bothering with a sole 
practitioner who runs a general practice.

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 275
 
✓ Finding out the location of each lawyer’s office. Don’t choose 
a lawyer who’s inconveniently far away if you can find some-
one just as good who’s easier to get to.
 
✓ Comparing the fee that each lawyer charges.
You can do all of this on the phone talking to a receptionist or 
secretary (and some lawyers even have their own Web sites with 
information about themselves and their practice). Don’t be shy 
about asking about fees — just ask how much the lawyer charges 
for a simple or straightforward will. Also ask whether the lawyer 
offers the first half-hour of consultation free. (Many do.)
Interview
If you end up with a short list of two or three lawyers who seem 
suitable, make an appointment to meet with each one. You’re just 
going to have a chat to find out if this lawyer is the one for you. 
Ask questions about
 
✓ How much experience the lawyer has in estate planning, 
drafting wills, and administering estates.
 
✓ What the lawyer’s fees are.
 
✓ Whether your work will be handled by the lawyer personally or
by others (other partners or associates, articling students, 
or law clerks).
You may find that you hardly have to ask anything — the lawyer 
may volunteer all the information you need. You’ll probably also 
pick up some free legal advice about your own estate and will. 
Lawyers can’t resist giving advice, even when they’re not getting 
paid for it. But the lawyer will be perfectly aware that he or she is 
being interviewed for a job, and most lawyers will want to make a 
good impression on you. By the end of your chat, you should also 
know whether you could work comfortably with this lawyer.
Understanding How Lawyers 
Charge for Their Work
Lawyers have different ways of charging for their services, depend-
ing on the work they’re doing. The usual ways of charging for will 
and estate work are
 
✓ Billing at an hourly rate for the time they spend working for you.
 
✓ Charging a flat rate for a particular matter.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
276
 
Besides their fees, lawyers also bill for disbursements, sums of money 
they have to lay out in order to do your work. Disbursements typi-
cally include long distance telephone calls, photocopies, document 
filing fees, and travel, among many possibilities. Sometimes they 
can really add up.
Lawyer’s fees are subject to GST (or HST where applicable). Some 
disbursements are also subject to GST or HST.
Billing at an hourly rate
For most matters, lawyers charge for the time they spend working 
for the client. That means charging for the time spent meeting with 
the client and holding telephone conversations with the client and 
with others on the client’s behalf, drafting documents, and prepar-
ing letters to the client and others. Lawyers also charge for reading 
letters and documents received from the client or others, doing 
research, and reviewing the file (reading through the file folders 
that hold all the documents related to the client’s case to remem-
ber what’s there — before actually getting down to work). They 
even charge for making phone calls that aren’t answered. Lawyers 
divide every hour into tenths, and start billing at 0.1 of an hour. 
A phone call that wasn’t answered or that was answered by voice 
mail would be billed as 0.1 (one-tenth of the lawyer’s hourly rate).
What’s the rate?
Lawyers’ hourly rates vary considerably. A kind-hearted lawyer in 
a small firm might quote an hourly rate of $200 or less to a client 
who didn’t have much money, while a super-duper lawyer in a big 
firm might charge a corporate client hundreds of dollars an hour.
If you need to see a specialist in a big firm, however, don’t fixate on 
the high hourly rate. A specialist can often solve a problem much 
more quickly than a general practitioner — and may end up cost-
ing less than the general practitioner, who’ll bill you for the time 
she spends educating herself about the law that applies to the 
matter (it may appear on your bill as “research”).
If you’re hiring a lawyer who’s charging by the hour, be sure to ask 
what the hourly rate is. In fact, get it in writing. Sometimes the rate 
is negotiable — and sometimes you go with that rate or you go to 
the competition (and see if they’ll do better). If your lawyer wants 
to raise the hourly rate after you’ve hired him, he has to tell you in 
advance and get your agreement.
Also ask, before any work is done, how long the lawyer estimates 
the work will take. If it turns out to take longer than estimated, 

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 277
your lawyer has to tell you (and get your agreement) before going 
past the estimate.
 
A lawyer who bills at an hourly rate should give you an account 
that shows not just the total number of hours but also a breakdown 
of how the time was spent. Ask for more detail if your bill doesn’t 
contain enough.
Retainers
A lawyer who bills at an hourly rate usually asks a client for a 
retainer before doing any work. A retainer is a deposit that is applied 
against the bill, usually enough to cover all of the estimated work 
or at least a substantial part of it. The retainer has to be held in 
a special trust account until the work is done and a bill has been 
prepared.
If the retainer is used up before the work is finished, the lawyer will 
ask for a further retainer. There’s no legal limit to the number of 
times a lawyer can ask for a retainer. If a client won’t give a retainer, 
the lawyer may very well not do the work the client wants done.
Charging a flat rate
Lawyers don’t always charge by the hour. For work that will take a 
fairly predictable amount of their time — such as acting on a house 
purchase or sale, or preparing a will or a power of attorney — 
they may be willing to quote a flat fee. Disbursements are usually 
charged over and above the flat fee, so be sure to ask how much 
they will cost.
Lawyers often ask for a retainer when charging a flat rate, just as 
when billing at an hourly rate.
Knowing What to Expect 
of Your Lawyer
You probably expect a lot of your lawyer. You probably haven’t 
broken down what you expect into categories, though. Provincial 
law societies have, however, in rules of professional conduct that 
require lawyers to
 
✓ Act with honesty.
 
✓ Provide legal services competently and promptly, and make 
sure that their assistants also act competently.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
278
 
✓ Keep client information confidential.
 
✓ Act with the client’s interests in mind only (rather than their 
own or anyone else’s).
 
✓ Keep the client fully informed about what work is being done 
and what’s happening in the matter.
 
✓ Act on the client’s instructions only.
That’s what law societies expect. But clients expect a little more 
than that. They expect their lawyer to treat them with respect and 
courtesy — for example,
 
✓ Not to keep them waiting for appointments.
 
✓ During appointments, not to deal with other clients and their 
problems (the lawyer’s phone shouldn’t even ring during an 
appointment).
 
✓ To explain legal matters in an understandable way, and not 
treat the client like a stupid person or a child.
 
✓ To return their phone calls within 24 hours.
Dealing with an Unsatisfactory 
Lawyer
We hope you’ll be happy with your lawyer if you’ve chosen wisely. 
But what should you do if you’re unhappy?
 
✓ If you have a one-time problem, such as a bill you can’t figure 
out, a snippy secretary, or a phone call that wasn’t returned, 
discuss it calmly with your lawyer. As a general rule, he wants 
to keep you on as a contented client.
 
✓ If you think that you’ve been overcharged by your lawyer, and 
are not satisfied with the lawyer’s explanation of the bill, you 
can get help from the court. You can make an appointment to 
have the bill reviewed by a court officer in a procedure called 
an assessment or taxation — it may take a while to get the 
appointment. If the officer agrees that you have been 
overcharged, the bill will be reduced.
 
✓ If you don’t feel that you’re getting good quality legal work at 
a good price, or if you’re not being treated well, you should 
look for another lawyer. Find the new lawyer first, and let her 
look after the details of telling the old lawyer he’s fired and of 
getting your documents away from him.

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 279
 
✓ If you think your lawyer has screwed up the work he was 
doing for you, or if your lawyer has indulged in some form of 
professional misconduct such as refusing to answer your calls 
and letters, or making unwanted sexual advances to you, you 
should get in touch with the provincial law society, which will 
investigate your complaint. If it finds a complaint is valid, it 
has the power to discipline lawyers by reprimanding them, 
suspending them from practice, or even disbarring them. If a 
lawyer has carelessly done bad work for you, you may be able 
to recover any lost money through the lawyer’s professional 
liability insurance.
 
✓ If your lawyer is really badly behaved and has done some-
thing like make off with your money to fund her gambling and 
cocaine habit, you can contact the law society and the police. 
Criminal charges can be laid against lawyers too. In addition, 
if your lawyer has deliberately harmed you (rather than care-
lessly harmed you by mismanaging your legal affairs), say by 
stealing your money, you can make a claim to the law society’s 
compensation fund.
Getting the Most from 
Your Lawyer
You want your lawyer to do the best possible job for you. You can 
help your lawyer to do the best job by:
 
✓ Doing your homework. If you know something about the law 
concerning your particular matter, you’ll be better able to 
explain your situation logically and tell your lawyer what you 
think you want. You’ll also have an idea what documents 
you need to bring with you. Bonus: The more you know about 
the law, the less time your lawyer will have to spend explaining 
it all to you.
 
✓ Collecting all your information and documents. Only you 
know what you have — some of it may turn out not to be 
useful, but it’s your lawyer’s job to decide what’s useful. It’s 
your job to put together everything you’ve got.
 
✓ Telling the truth. Your lawyer has to know the whole story in 
order to do a good job.
 
✓ Giving clear instructions. Only you can tell your lawyer what 
to do. Your lawyer can set out your options for you and tell 
you what the consequences will be if you choose a certain 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
280
course of action. Your lawyer can even recommend a particular 
course of action. But your lawyer can’t just decide what to do 
and go off and do it. Make sure you tell your lawyer exactly 
what you want done.
 
✓ Acting promptly. If you need legal help, it’s best to get it 
sooner rather than later.
 
✓ Being available. Don’t make it difficult for your lawyer to reach 
you — make sure there’s a way to leave a message for you 
if you’re not in. Return your lawyer’s phone calls (leaving 
a detailed message if she’s not in) and answer her letters 
promptly. If there are documents for you to sign, don’t take 
off for the cottage or a conference without speaking to your 
lawyer first.
 
✓ Keeping copies. If you’ve received letters or documents from 
your lawyer or sent documents to him, keep copies of them. 
Then you’ll always know exactly what’s been done or decided, 
and you’ll reduce the chance of communication failures with 
your lawyer.
How Your Lawyer Can Help 
You Assemble Your Team
Your lawyer should be your main source of estate planning advice. 
An experienced wills and estates lawyer will have a fuller appreciation 
of the big estate planning picture than other estate planning advisers 
because so many estate planning issues are legal issues.
And you can count on a lawyer to be reasonably unbiased in refer-
ring you for additional help. A good lawyer will know when to call 
in the other professionals. Your lawyer might suggest that you
 
✓ Speak to an accountant if you need specialized tax advice in 
planning your estate or if you need financial planning assistance.
 
✓ Speak to a financial planner for help with financial planning 
or if you are looking for investment strategies to increase the 
value of your estate.
 
✓ Speak to representatives of a trust company if you are thinking 
of appointing an institutional executor.
 
✓ Speak to an insurance agent or broker if you need life insurance 
to pay taxes or debts or to increase the value of your estate.

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 281
Crunching Numbers with a 
Professional Accountant
You may like an accountant to help you prepare a financial plan, and 
you may see your estate plan as part of that overall financial plan. Or 
you may want to consult an accountant for tax advice about plan-
ning your estate. An accountant should be able to give you finan-
cial and tax advice about estate planning. Just don’t forget that 
there’s a lot more to estate planning than those two things.
 
In Canada, anyone can call himself or herself an accountant. So you 
don’t just want “an accountant.” That could be anyone who can 
count to 10 (20 in bare feet). You want an accountant who has a 
professional designation.
Looking at the types of professional 
accountants
Only two types of professional accountants ordinarily offer tax and 
estate planning advice to individuals:
 
✓ Chartered accountants (CAs)
 
✓ Certified general accountants (CGAs)
Both chartered accountants and certified general accountants are 
required to maintain third-party liability insurance, also known as 
errors and omissions insurance, which is designed to compensate 
a client financially if the accountant makes a mistake. (The client 
may have to start a court action to get any insurance money.)
These accountants are also bound by professional standards 
and a code of ethics, and can be disciplined by the organization 
they belong to for doing poor work for a client or treating a client 
badly. If a client complains, the organization will investigate. So if 
a professional accountant does you wrong, something worse will 
happen to him or her than getting flicked with a wet towel in the 
locker room.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
282
Understanding how accountants 
charge for their services
Accountants usually bill at an hourly rate for the time they spend 
with you or working for you, or charge a flat fee for a particular 
matter.
Professional accountants aren’t allowed to receive a commission 
for selling the products of others or to receive payment from a 
third party in return for referring a client to that person for ser-
vices. So you can expect a professional accountant to give you 
unbiased advice.
 
If you think you’ve been overcharged for the work an accountant 
has done for you, and speaking to the accountant or the accoun-
tant’s manager in the accounting firm doesn’t resolve it, take the 
matter up with the organization the accountant is a member of. 
Some of them offer fee dispute resolution services.
Finding an accountant
You want to find an accountant with experience in estate planning 
matters, whom you’ll feel comfortable working with, and who will 
charge you a reasonable fee. How will you find an accountant 
like that?
 
✓ Get recommendations. Ask your lawyer, friends, relatives, or 
business associates for the names of accountants who have 
done similar work for them. Contact your provincial institute 
of chartered accountants or certified general accountants’ 
organization for accountants in your area who specialize in 
estate planning.
 
✓ Do a little investigating. Call the accountant’s office to find 
out a bit more about his or her areas of expertise. Ask about 
the accountant’s standard hourly rate. See whether the 
accountant’s office is conveniently located for you.
 
✓ Interview. After you’ve narrowed down the field to two or three 
accountants, make an appointment to meet with each one. 
You’re looking for information about the accountant and for your 
personal reaction to the accountant, to see if you want to work 
with him or her. In the course of your chat, ask each accountant
 
• How much experience he or she has in estate planning.
 
• What his or her fees would be for this work.
 
• Whether your work will be handled by the accountant 
personally or by others.

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 283
Determining Your Game Plan 
with a Financial Planner
If you’re interested in following investment strategies to increase 
the value of your estate, or you are planning your estate as part of 
an overall financial plan, you may start the estate planning process 
by looking for a financial planner. You’ll find financial planners 
in financial planning firms, in banks and trust companies, and in 
investment firms.
 
In every province except Quebec, anyone can call himself or her-
self a financial planner. No minimum level of education or profes-
sional training is required for people to call themselves financial 
planners. Yet various organizations offer credentials following the 
completion of distance learning courses and passing of examina-
tions set by the organization.
Understanding how financial 
planners are paid for their services
You may not be charged for the financial planner’s services at all — 
at least not directly. But that doesn’t mean that financial planners 
work for free.
Financial planners may be paid
 
✓ By charging the client a fee — either by billing at an hourly 
rate, or by charging a flat fee for a particular set of services.
 
✓ By charging a management fee that’s a percentage of the value 
of a client’s property under management.
 
✓ By earning commissions from insurance companies, financial 
institutions, and investment funds for selling their products to 
a client.
 
✓ By earning bonuses from companies, institutions, and funds 
for selling certain products or a minimum number of certain 
products.
 
✓ Through a combination of fees and commissions.
What’s the quality of the service you get?
You can be fairly sure of getting unbiased financial advice from a 
planner who only charges a fee for his or her service.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
284
 
You can’t be so sure of getting unbiased advice from a financial 
planner who is paid by commission or bonus, either wholly or in 
part. It is in the financial planner’s interest to persuade you to buy 
what he or she has for sale, and even more so to persuade you to 
buy the product that gives the financial planner the highest com-
mission or bonus.
Financial planners who are salaried employees of companies such 
as investment brokerages, banks, trust companies, and insur-
ance companies may be under pressure to sell the products their 
employer offers. They want to keep their jobs by meeting sales tar-
gets, and they probably wouldn’t mind earning bonuses and salary 
increases as well.
What’s your game plan?
Someone working on commission or for a financial institution or 
brokerage may tend to advise you to build your estate plan around 
the product(s) that he or she sells. Your estate plan may end up 
heavy on insurance if the financial planner sells insurance, or on 
mutual funds if the financial planner sells mutual funds.
We don’t mean to say that financial planners who are working on 
commission or for a brokerage or financial institution will always 
sell you products you don’t need. The products may be just fine 
and perfect for your needs. But take the advice you’re given with a 
grain of salt.
 
Ask the financial planner about any commission or bonus he 
or she is getting on the recommended product(s), or what 
sales target he or she has for the product(s), and check out the 
product(s) independently, comparing them with similar products 
available elsewhere. Think carefully, before buying anything, about 
whether a product really fits in with your estate planning goals.
Finding a financial planner
Because financial planners and their organizations aren’t subject 
to provincial legislation, as lawyers and professional accountants 
and their organizations are, choose a financial planner based on 
others’ recommendations and your own investigation.
You want to find a financial planner with experience in estate 
planning matters, with whom you feel comfortable working, who 

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 285
doesn’t get paid in commissions, and who will charge you a rea-
sonable fee. How do you do that?
 
✓ Get recommendations. Ask your lawyer or your accountant, 
or friends, relatives, or business associates for the names of 
financial planners who have done estate planning work for 
them. If that doesn’t produce any leads, go to the Financial 
Planners Standards Council (FPSC) Web site (www.fpsc
canada.org) to help you find a Certified Financial Planner or 
the Web site for the Financial Advisors Association of Canada, 
Advocis at www.advocis.ca to help you find a Registered 
Financial Planner near you.
 
✓ Do some investigating. When you’ve got some names, call 
each financial planner’s office to find out more about the 
areas in which he or she has expertise. Ask whether the finan-
cial planner receives commissions. Ask about the fee that the 
financial planner charges. Check the location of each financial 
planner’s office for convenience.
 
✓ Interview. After you narrow down the choices to two or three 
financial planners, meet with each one before you make your 
pick. Ask them about the following:
 
• Their educational background — including university 
and courses taken for financial planning certification.
 
• Their experience in estate planning matters — how 
many years in the field and how many clients.
 
• The availability of references from their clients.
 
• The type of services they provide.
 
• What products (if any) they receive commissions on.
 
• What their fees are for the kind of work you want done.
 
• Whether they carry errors and omissions insurance.
 
• Whether your work will be handled by the planner 
personally or by others.
Knowing what to do if your 
financial planner messes up
 
If you aren’t happy with the financial planner’s work or the bill, 
discuss your concerns with the planner. If you’re still unhappy and 
your planner works for a company, you can speak to the manager 
of the company. If that doesn’t resolve the problem, you can take 

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
286
the matter up with whatever professional organization the planner 
belongs to. Some of the organizations offer dispute resolution ser-
vices or can discipline members for breaching a code of conduct. 
If the financial planner makes a mistake that costs you a lot of 
money, you can sue him or her — but if you win your lawsuit you 
may not be able to collect your money unless the financial planner 
has errors and omissions insurance.
Banking on Banks, Trust 
Companies, and Credit Unions
If you decide to go to a bank, trust company, or credit union for 
financial planning advice, you may be offered some advice about 
your estate as part of your financial plan. Your advisers will be 
employees of the bank, trust company, or credit union. Their job 
description is more likely to be “sell products” than “give disinter-
ested advice.”
It’s not game over, though. Trust companies in fact offer thorough 
estate planning advice (usually available only at certain branches). 
Most banks are now associated with trust companies and can refer a 
customer seeking estate planning advice to their trust company arm.
 
Many trust companies provide very informative free estate plan-
ning pamphlets. Anyone can get a copy of these pamphlets from 
the trust company, and many of them can be downloaded from 
trust company Web sites.
Trust companies go further than pamphlets. They also employ 
estate planning advisers who help customers to develop an estate 
plan before a will is drafted or updated by a lawyer. These advisers 
are quite knowledgeable about estate planning issues, and the ser-
vice is provided free of charge. There’s a catch though: This ser-
vice is offered only to customers who are going to name the trust 
company as sole executor or co-executor in their will.
 
If you go to a trust company for information about estate planning, 
expect a sales pitch for the appointment of the trust company as 
your executor. If you don’t want to appoint the trust company, you 
won’t get any estate planning advice.
Why do the trust companies provide an estate planning service for 
free? If you name a trust company as your executor, when you die 
your estate will be charged a fee for their estate administration ser-
vices. (The fee will be based on the value of your estate and/or the 
work done.) So the service isn’t so much “free” as “billed later.”

 Chapter 16: Getting Professional Help 287
If you do decide to appoint the trust company as your executor or 
co-executor, it’s in the trust company’s interest to make sure that 
your estate plan makes sense. That way it will be able to carry out 
the instructions in your will with a minimum amount of trouble.
Getting Acquainted with Life 
Insurance Agents or Brokers
If you need life insurance to build the value of your estate or to pay 
taxes or debts, you may edge into estate planning by speaking to 
an insurance agent or broker. An insurance agent or broker can 
give you advice about how much insurance you need, the kind of 
policy to buy, and how to get through the insurance application 
process.
When we talk about an insurance agent, we mean a person who 
deals with only one insurance company and sells only that compa-
ny’s policies. When we talk about an insurance broker, we mean a 
person who deals with and sells the policies of several companies. 
A broker can get quotes on insurance policies from several compa-
nies, whereas an agent can get you an insurance policy from one 
company only.
Both agents and brokers are regulated and licensed by provincial 
governments.
Understanding how agents and 
brokers are paid for their services
Insurance agents and brokers are paid a commission by the 
insurance company for each policy they sell. Generally speak-
ing, the more expensive the policy, the higher the commission. 
Commissions for permanent policies are higher than commissions 
for term policies. So insurance agents are like financial planners 
who work on commission — it’s in the agent’s or broker’s interest 
to get you to buy an insurance policy, and to get you to buy a more 
expensive policy. If you’re dealing with a broker, the more insur-
ance a broker sells for a particular company, the higher the rate of 
the broker’s commission.
Because an agent’s or broker’s interests can be different from 
yours, choose carefully the agent or broker you go to for advice, 
compare insurance policies on your own before you buy, and think 
about whether any insurance that’s suggested to you fits in with 
your estate plan as a whole.

Part IV: Putting Your Plan into Action 
288
 
Beware of insurance salespeople masquerading as estate planning 
specialists. Because insurance brokers and agents work on com-
mission, you may end up with an estate plan built around insur-
ance policies when another approach may be better for you.
Finding an insurance agent 
or broker
If you’re in the market for a good insurance adviser, ask for rec-
ommendations from your family and friends, from your lawyer or 
accountant, or from the agent or broker you deal with for your car 
or home insurance. Then contact the recommended agents or bro-
kers and ask each of them about
 
✓ His or her qualifications to provide advice about insurance 
as part of an estate plan. Some agents and brokers hold vari-
ous professional designations — you might want to ask what 
courses and exams were required to get a designation. Ask 
particularly about qualifications related to estate planning 
rather than financial planning.
 
✓ His or her experience. How many years has he or she spent 
in the life insurance business, how long has he or she been 
giving advice about estate planning, and how many clients does 
he or she have? Or had? You should probably take a greater 
interest in the dead clients than the ones who are still alive. It’s 
the dead ones who’ve tested the agent’s or broker’s expertise.
 
✓ Past performance. Can he or she give you references from 
clients?
 
✓ The amount of commission paid for the products he or she 
sells. (If it’s a broker, also ask about different rates of commis-
sion from different insurance companies.)
 
✓ Errors and omissions insurance. Does he or she carry this 
liability insurance for clients’ protection?
Insurance agents and brokers are sometimes willing to come to 
you, rather than making you come to them. You may prefer to meet 
in your chosen adviser’s office instead of your living room, though. 
It’s easier to leave an office, if you want to do some thinking before 
you make a decision, than it is to ask someone to leave your home.

Readying Your 
Estate and Keeping 
It Up to Date

In this part…
T
his part sends you back to work. Here we tell you that 
it’s not enough to make plans and create legal docu-
ments (a will, a power of attorney, a living will) to carry 
out those plans. You also have to organize your affairs so 
that your executor can do what you want. We tell you that 
making plans once is usually not enough — we set out the 
changes in your life, others’ lives, and the law that should 
be your cue to review your estate plan.

Chapter 17
Don’t Leave a Mess Behind: 
Putting Your Affairs in Order
In This Chapter:
▶ Reducing the confusion that your illness and death will cause your family
▶ Making sure your family can get their hands on the documents and 
instructions they’ll need
▶ Putting everything together for your executor
▶ Choosing the best place to leave your documents and instructions
You’re doing all this estate planning for the sake of your family 
or other people who are close to you. Don’t let the last act of 
your life or the first act of your death be to drive them nuts! Make 
sure the information they’ll need will be available to them.
Preventing Your Death from 
Causing Confusion in 
Your Family
Your financial and medical affairs will probably be pretty much up 
in the air just before and just after your death. You need to pre-
pare for that as well as for your death.
Before you die
Tell your dependent family members about the arrangements 
you’ve made to take care of them after your death (life insurance 
policies and benefits plans naming them as beneficiaries, as well as 
provisions in your will).

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date 
292
If you’re incapable of looking after your finances in the days (or 
weeks, or months) before your exit, you’ll need a power of attor-
ney to cover the situation. So do it now — while you’re still fully 
capable of looking after yourself and your business — and then 
don’t forget to tell your family that you’ve got a power of attorney. 
You can check out powers of attorney in Chapter 14.
If you’re incapable of making decisions about your medical care, 
either because you’re unconscious or you’re mentally incapable, 
you’ll need a living will to allow your family to make decisions about 
the care you receive. Have it prepared at the same time as your 
power of attorney. Make sure your family knows about it as well as 
your power of attorney. For more on living wills, go to Chapter 15.
After you die
Your power of attorney will become invalid the moment you die. At 
the same time, your bank accounts will be frozen for most purposes 
and your safety deposit box will be inaccessible until your executor 
gets organized and, in some cases, gets letters probate. (For more 
on the executor’s responsibilities, see chapters 7 and 13.)
 
If you’ve told your family about your arrangements, as we advise in 
the previous section, they or your executor will be able to contact 
an insurance company or benefits plan administrator to get the 
money as soon as possible.
Your family will find your insurance very helpful at this time — the 
proceeds of your insurance policy will reach them much faster than 
the funds in your estate. But the insurance company will still take a 
little while to satisfy itself that you’re dead and pay the policy pro-
ceeds to a family member you’ve named as the beneficiary.
 
If your family is financially dependent on you, you want them to be 
able to get at some cash for immediate expenses such as food and 
mortgage or rent payments. Do this by having a joint account with 
a family member and always keeping enough there for emergency 
expenses. The joint account holder will be able to go on making 
withdrawals after you die.
Organizing the Documents and 
Instructions Your Family Will Need
Your family will run into trouble helping either you (while you’re 
alive) or themselves (whether you’re alive and incapable or dead) if 
they don’t have the necessary documents and instructions from you.

 Chapter 17: Putting Your Affairs in Order 293
If you become incapacitated 
before you die
If you depart this world in stages, your family members, rather 
than your executor, will be the first to need important documents 
from you. So they’ll need to have easy access to
 
✓ Your living will. Your substitute decision maker should have 
a copy of your living will and should know where the original 
is. Your doctor should have a copy of the document too.
 
✓ Your power of attorney. Give your named attorney a photo-
copy and tell him or her where the original is. Do not leave 
the original in your safety deposit box unless your attorney 
has signing rights to get into your box and knows where the 
key is.
 
✓ Information your family may need to deal with the govern-
ment or your employer — things like your social insurance 
number, old age security number, marriage certificate, armed 
services record (if any), employment contract, and employee 
number.
 
✓ Information your family may need to deal with your mort-
gage lender or landlord — things like your mortgage pay-
ment schedule or your residential lease.
After you die
Once you’re gone, your executor has to take over the job of look-
ing after the details. Your executor may be a close family member 
who’s already familiar with your affairs, a more distant relative, 
a friend, a business associate, or even a trust company. If your 
executor is not a close family member, make sure that your family 
knows who your executor is!
Assembling the Documents 
Your Executor Will Need
Your executor will arrive on the scene and immediately need lots 
and lots of pieces of paper. Make sure that your executor has 
everything he needs.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date 
294
The duties of an executor
Your executor’s duties include:
 
✓ Making your funeral arrangements.
 
✓ Collecting information about your estate.
 
✓ Applying for letters probate.
 
✓ Protecting the property of your estate.
 
✓ Gathering in the property of your estate.
 
✓ Making an inventory of the property of your estate, and value 
the property.
 
✓ Paying your legitimate debts and your estate’s taxes.
 
✓ Distributing the estate to your beneficiaries, according to the 
instructions set out in your will.
All of these tasks will be easier with information and documents 
organized by you.
Making your funeral arrangements
If you’ve already made your own funeral arrangements, your exec-
utor needs the pre-arrangement documents so she’ll know which 
funeral home to send you to. If you’ve also pre-paid, your executor 
will need the contract and receipt for your payment. If you have 
interment rights in a cemetery, your executor will need to know 
whether you own them alone (in which case only your estate — via 
your executor — has to give permission to get you buried there) or 
with someone else (in which case the surviving owner and possi-
bly the estate as well will have to give permission). (We explain all 
these funeral and burial options in Chapter 11.)
If you haven’t done any pre-arranging, your executor may need 
information for your death certificate and a statement of your pref-
erences for your funeral and disposal of your remains.
 
You can use the “Instructions for Your Executor” form that you’ll 
find at the end of this book as Appendix B.
The information required for your death certificate form, which 
the funeral home will fill out, includes
 
✓ Your name
 
✓ Your usual residence address

 Chapter 17: Putting Your Affairs in Order 295
 
✓ The place and date of your birth (your birth certificate would 
be handy)
 
✓ Your marital status (your marriage certificate would also 
be handy, as well as any divorce decrees or spousal death 
certificates)
 
✓ Your occupation
 
✓ The names of your mother and father (birth certificate again)
The information required also includes the place and date of your 
death . . . but let someone else worry about that.
When you leave directions about your preferences for your 
funeral, think about the following matters (go to Chapter 11 for 
more information):
 
✓ The funeral home you would like to use, perhaps one your 
family has traditionally used and that has information about 
past funerals in your family.
 
✓ Whether you want to be embalmed — well, want is probably 
too strong a word — or whether you absolutely don’t want 
anyone coming near you with formaldehyde.
 
✓ Whether you want an open casket and whether you want cos-
metics applied.
 
✓ What clothes you’d like to be buried in, if you have a favourite 
outfit.
 
✓ Whether you’d like to have some particular item buried with 
you, such as a piece of jewellery, a book, or a photograph.
 
✓ Your obituary — you can write one for yourself or ask some-
one else to write it.
 
✓ Whether you want a visitation.
 
✓ Whether you want a funeral service (you’re present, in body if 
not in spirit) or a memorial service (after your body has been 
buried or cremated).
 
✓ Whether there are people you are sure will want to attend 
your funeral, and whether your funeral should be delayed a 
few days to accommodate them if necessary.
 
✓ Details of your funeral or memorial service:
 
• The person you would like to officiate at the service.
 
• Where the service should be held (funeral home, place 
of worship, or elsewhere).
 
• What form of service you would like used.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date 
296
 
• What passages (from a religious text, poem, or book) 
you would like read.
 
• What music you would like played, and by whom (if you 
have, for example, a family member or friend who plays 
a musical instrument).
 
• What hymns you would like sung. 
 
• What special prayer(s) you would like said.
 
• Whether you would like a eulogy and, if so, whom you 
would like to deliver it. 
 
• The people you want to act as pallbearers (the funeral 
home can supply muscle pallbearers if your pallbearers 
are more the honorary sort) or ushers.
 
• Whether you would like a reception following the ser-
vice and where it should be held.
 
• Whether you would like memorial donations instead of 
or in addition to flowers.
 
✓ Details of your preferred disposal arrangements:
 
• Whether you want to be buried or cremated, or even 
whether you want to be buried at sea.
 
• If you choose to be cremated, what you would like done 
with your ashes — whether they should be buried or put 
into a columbarium in the urn, or whether they should 
be scattered in a particular place.
 
• Your preferred cemetery.
 
• The kind of monument you would like (upright stone or 
marker), and the inscription you would like.
 
• Whether you would like a memorial of some kind placed 
somewhere other than your grave — for example, a tree 
or a bench in your favourite municipal park.
 
✓ How you would like your funeral arrangements paid for — out 
of a specific bank account or insurance policy, or through an 
employment benefits plan.
Collecting information 
about your estate
You should leave an inventory of your property among your 
documents. It’s unlikely you’ll be able to keep your inventory 
right up to date to the time of your death, but it should contain at 
least general information about what you own and where further 

 Chapter 17: Putting Your Affairs in Order 297
information about your property can be found. You can use the 
“Inventory for Your Executor,” which you’ll find at the end of this 
book as Appendix C.
Your property includes
 
✓ Real estate. What’s the address of each piece of land?
 
✓ Bank accounts. What’s the name of the bank or trust com-
pany, and the account number?
 
✓ Investments. Who’s your broker? (Your monthly statements 
will be really useful.) If you have no broker, what are your 
investments (GICs, Canada Savings Bonds, mutual funds, 
shares, and so on)?
 
✓ RRSPs and RRIFs. What’s the name of the institution that 
manages the plan or fund? State whether the beneficiary is a 
named individual or your estate.
 
✓ Valuable capital property such as artwork, jewellery, 
antiques, and collections. Describe each item.
 
✓ Insurance policies. What’s the name of the insurance com-
pany, the face amount of the policy, and the name of the ben-
eficiary (an individual or your estate)?
 
✓ Pension plans. What’s the name of the institution that runs 
the plan? It’s also useful to mention whether any of your 
surviving family members are entitled to benefits after your 
death.
 
✓ Debts owed to you. What’s the name of your debtor and the 
reason for the debt?
In addition to the information suggested above, also state the fol-
lowing for each asset:
 
✓ The approximate value of the property. Your executor will 
use your inventory to apply for letters probate, and in almost 
all provinces probate fees are calculated on the value of your 
property. In the case of especially valuable items (such as a 
house, for example), your executor may need to get an expert 
appraisal of the property.
 
✓ Whether you own the property together with another person 
(and if so, what that person’s name is). If you own property 
jointly with a right of survivorship, the property passes 
directly to the joint owner on your death and does not form 
part of your estate.
 
✓ Where the property is located, especially if it is not in your 
house, cottage, or office.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date 
298
 
✓ Where the documents relating to the property are located. 
These documents could include ownership documents, valu-
ation of the property, insurance on the property, loans made 
to buy the property or made against the property, lease on a 
building or locker where the property is stored, and so on.
Your executor is responsible for paying your debts, so don’t forget 
to leave information about them:
 
✓ Mortgages. What are the address of the property and the 
name of your mortgage lender?
 
✓ Loans (such as a car loan). What’s the loan for and what’s the 
name of the lender?
 
✓ Back taxes and utility payments. Who’s your creditor?
 
✓ Credit cards. What institution issued the card, and what’s 
your account number?
 
✓ Business debts, if you are a sole proprietor or partner in a 
business, or if you have guaranteed a debt for a corporation. 
Who’s the creditor? What’s the security for the debt?
In addition to the information above, also include information about
 
✓ The approximate balance of the debt.
 
✓ Where the documents relating to the debt can be found.
 
✓ Whether anyone else has responsibility to pay the debt too, 
either as a co-borrower or as a guarantor.
Applying for letters probate
In order to apply for letters probate, your executor will need these 
items:
 
✓ Your will — the signed original, not a photocopy.
 
✓ The name and address of the lawyer who prepared the will. 
Even if your lawyer doesn’t have the original will, he or she 
probably has the Affidavit of Execution (signed by the wit-
nesses to your will), which the probate court will want to see 
before it grants probate. (We tell you about this requirement 
in Chapter 13.)
 
✓ The inventory of your estate, with approximate values of your 
property.
Once armed with letters probate, your executor will be able to get 
physical and legal access to your property.

 Chapter 17: Putting Your Affairs in Order 299
Protecting the property 
of your estate
To protect the property of your estate, your executor will need
 
✓ Your inventory, including approximate values, so he or she 
knows what property you have in the first place.
 
✓ Any insurance documents you already have for any of your 
property.
 
✓ Any appraisals you have for individual items.
 
✓ Information about any existing security measures, such as an 
alarm system (your executor will want the code).
 
✓ Information about partners, employees, and business advis-
ers, if your business forms part of your estate (if you are a 
sole proprietor or partner). Your executor will either have to 
keep your business running or begin shutting it down.
Your executor may find it necessary to insure property you don’t 
currently have insured, or to put some of your property into a 
safety deposit box or secure storage.
Gathering in the property 
of your estate
Your executor must gather in your estate — find and take posses-
sion of all the property that is part of your estate. To do so, your 
executor will need:
 
✓ Your inventory (yet again) — and the inventory should 
include the location of any piece of property that’s not in your 
house, cottage, or office. If you’ve hidden any of your valuable 
property, your executor will need to know the hiding place.
 
✓ Any documents showing your ownership of property (such as 
a land deed, car ownership, and share certificates).
 
✓ Anything required to reach your property, such as keys, safe 
combinations, codes, or passwords.
If any of the property in your house, cottage, safety deposit box, 
storage locker, and so on doesn’t belong to you, make a note of 
that on your inventory list too, and give the name and address of 
the real owner.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date 
300
 
Part of the gathering-in process may involve helping your survivors 
to get life insurance proceeds and survivors’ pension benefits. If your 
survivors are entitled to receive anything directly from an insurance 
company, a pension plan, or a government plan, make sure that infor-
mation is available too — make it part of your inventory.
Making an inventory and valuing 
the property of your estate
When your executor makes an inventory of your estate, the inven-
tory you prepared will, once again, be invaluable!
One of the main purposes of this step in estate administration is to 
figure out whether items of your property have increased in value 
since you got them, for the purpose of calculating capital gains tax 
on your terminal return (see Chapter 3). That means your executor 
will need to know what the value of any piece of capital property 
was when you got it and the value on the day of your death.
Any documents you have showing the value of capital property 
when you acquired it will be very useful. A bill of sale would be 
good, or an appraisal for insurance purposes. If you don’t have 
such documents, your executor will have to find someone to give 
an appraisal as of the date you got the property. (Or as of the 
beginning of 1972 — whichever is later. Capital gains tax was first 
imposed in Canada in 1972, so capital gains are only calculated 
from then.)
In addition, it would be helpful for you to provide your executor 
with the names of appraisers you’ve dealt with in the past — real 
estate agents, jewellers, your stockbroker, antique or collectible 
dealers, your accountant. They can be asked to value your property.
Paying debts and taxes
Your executor probably won’t be besieged by people falsely claim-
ing that you owed them a hundred (or a hundred thousand) bucks, 
but he or she still has to take care to pay only legitimate debts. 
A legitimate debt is one you really owe and in that exact amount. 
You should provide all the essential information about your legiti-
mate debts as part of your inventory.
If you don’t leave enough clues about your debts, then your 
executor has to advertise for your creditors (in local newspapers). 
Your executor may also have to argue (and maybe even get into 

 Chapter 17: Putting Your Affairs in Order 301
a lawsuit) with a creditor about whether there’s a debt and how 
much it is. Don’t waste your executor’s time and your estate’s 
money by forgetting to mention your debts.
Now, as for your taxes, your executor will need
 
✓ Your previous tax returns — so say where they can be found.
 
✓ The name and address of your accountant, if you had an 
accountant prepare your returns in the past.
 
✓ Your inventory, particularly the part that shows your capital 
property such as a cottage or other piece of real estate that 
is not a principal residence, your investments, valuable art, 
antiques or collectibles, and so on.
 
✓ Your will, which says whether any of your capital property 
is being rolled over to your spouse (or any other eligible 
person) and which your executor therefore doesn’t have 
to include in the capital gains calculation in your terminal 
return.
 
✓ Any documents showing your cost of acquiring capital prop-
erty. These documents could include bills of sale from the 
time of purchase, appraisals dating to the time of purchase, 
and trade slips for investments that show the cost of buying 
and the broker’s commission. If you bought or received 
capital property before December 31, 1971, your executor 
needs to know the value of the property as of February 1972. 
(February 14, 1972, was the official “Valuation Day” for capital 
property acquired before capital gains tax came into effect in 
1972.)
 
✓ Any documents showing your income for the taxation year, 
and documents relating to your RRSPs or RRIFs (which will be 
taxed as income in your terminal return).
Distributing your estate
Your executor will have to distribute your property to the people 
named in your will. She will probably be able to find your spouse 
and your children without too much trouble, but your second 
cousin Fred or your dear school friend Laurinda may be harder to 
locate.
 
If you remember in your will people whom your executor or close 
family don’t know or haven’t kept up with, leave a note of their cur-
rent addresses among the documents you’re accumulating for your 
executor.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date 
302
Keeping Your Documents Safe
Are your documents scattered around your kitchen? Hidden under 
your mattress? Filed under “Personal” at your office? Locked up in 
your safety deposit box? If your documents are currently in several 
places, consider reducing your document repository sites. Try to 
keep your important documents in one place.
 
And think twice about putting your documents away too securely. 
True, they contain information you don’t normally share with 
others. But if you hide them they may not be found when they’re 
needed, or not in time to be useful. If you put them in your safety 
deposit box, no one without signing authority will be able to get 
in (even if you leave the key and box number lying around) — and 
in the event of your death the bank or trust company may not let 
your executor remove anything from the box (except possibly your 
will) until he or she has letters probate.
If you store your information electronically, make sure that your 
executor knows how to find your files on your computer and has 
any passwords necessary for access.

I
n Chapter 1 we tell you that estate planning is not a one-time 
exercise but a continuing process. In this chapter we explain to 
you why you need to review and revise your estate plan, and when 
and how you revise it.
Discovering What’s Involved in 
Reviewing Your Estate Plan
Reviewing your estate plan means taking another look at
 
✓ Your plans for giving a share of your estate to family and 
friends
 
✓ Your financial arrangements, such as investment strategies, 
tax reduction or avoidance strategies, gifts to family members 
during your lifetime, and life insurance
 
✓ Guardianship arrangements for your children
 
✓ Succession arrangements for a business that you own

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date

✓ Your will
 
✓ Your beneficiary designations on your life insurance policies, 
RRSPs, RRIFs, and pensions
 
✓ Your power of attorney
 
✓ Your living will
Learning Why and When You Need 
to Review and Revise 
Your Estate Plan
You need to review and revise your estate plan for the same rea-
sons that you needed an estate plan in the first place — to make 
sure that, when you die,
 
✓ You have done everything in your power to see that your 
family will have enough money to manage without you and 
your income.
 
✓ Your property will go to the people you want to have it.
 
✓ A person you chose will look after your estate.
 
✓  You have a say in who will look after your minor children.
 
✓ Your debts can be paid with the least damage to your estate.
 
✓ The taxes and probate fees your estate has to pay will be as 
low as possible.
 
✓ The future of any business you own has been looked after.
You should think about revising your estate plan as changes occur 
in your personal life, for example:
 
✓ If you marry, if your spouse or partner dies, if you separate or 
divorce, or if you meet a new partner.
 
✓ If you have children, as your children grow up, and as your 
children become independent.
 
✓ If you develop serious health problems.
 
✓ If a member of your family develops special needs.
 
✓  If you move and change your province or country of residence.
 
✓ If your executor of first choice will not be able to act.

 Chapter 18: Updating Your Estate Plan 305
You should also think about revising your estate plan if there are 
changes in your financial and economic life, for example, changes in
 
✓ The nature and value of your property
 
✓ A business you own
Finally, you need to revise your estate plan and will if there are 
changes in the law, particularly tax law, family law, and succession 
law.
You think your life is the same old grind and nothing much ever 
happens? Don’t count on it, at least as far as your estate plan is 
concerned. Change has a way of creeping up on people, so even if 
you think your life is in a rut, it’s a good idea to run a review every 
few years. You may be surprised how out of date your earlier plans 
and arrangements have become.
Changes in your personal life
Whether pleasant or unpleasant, major changes in your personal 
life can have a great impact on your estate plan.
If you get married
Getting married is a big event, and it calls for a reassessment of 
your entire financial strategy. So you’ll want to go over your estate 
plan, in particular your will, carefully.
 
When you marry, any will that you signed before your marriage 
is automatically cancelled as a result of your marriage. If you die 
before you sign a new will, you will die without a will, and pro-
vincial intestacy law will govern what happens to your estate (it 
will go to your spouse and surviving relatives in a fixed order;see 
Chapter 12).
The purpose of this rule is to protect your new husband or wife if 
you didn’t have the forethought to do it yourself. That’s why the 
only exception to this rule proves the rule. If you sign a will before 
you get married and the will clearly states that it’s being made in 
contemplation of your marriage, that will continues to be valid after 
you get married.
Even if you don’t want to make any changes in your existing will, 
you still must sign a new will just to keep your old arrangements 
valid. However, keeping your old arrangements may not be a real-
istic option once you are married — you’ll at least have to take 
into account your spouse’s potential claim as a dependant and his 
or her claim to a minimum share of your estate under provincial 
family law legislation. (See Chapter 13.)

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date  
306
If your spouse dies
If your spouse dies, your will in general continues to be valid. 
However every gift to your spouse will fail. If you die without 
changing your will, any gift of specific property you made to your 
spouse will go to an alternate beneficiary you named or (if you 
didn’t name an alternate) fall back into the residue of the estate. If 
you left the residue of your estate to your spouse, it will go to an 
alternate beneficiary of the residue you named. If you didn’t name 
an alternate (or the alternate has also died), the residue will be 
distributed as if you had died without a will. Provincial intestacy 
legislation will govern what happens to it. (See Chapter 12.)
So, if your spouse dies you have to review your will to see whether 
you need to name a new person to receive whatever property you 
originally left to your spouse. If you named your spouse as your 
executor and didn’t name an alternate executor, you will have to 
come up with a new executor as well.
You’ll also have to rethink your tax planning strategies, since you 
will not only have lost your spouse but also the ability to use the 
primary tax-saving strategy — the spousal rollover (see Chapter 3). 
It may well be that your taxes will be higher than before, in which 
case you will have to come up with a plan for your estate to pay the 
additional tax.
If your marriage breaks down
When you run headlong into marital problems, rethinking your 
estate plan may take a backseat to fighting, trying to get custody 
of the kids, worrying about finances, and wondering if you’ll ever 
be able to get a date. Even if your lawyer doesn’t drag your estate 
plan into the fray, you shouldn’t wait too long to go over it.
 
Your will continues in effect if you and your spouse separate and 
do not divorce. If you die before divorcing and before changing 
your will, your spouse will be entitled to receive any gifts you 
made him or her in your will, and to act as your executor if named 
as executor.
If you and your spouse divorce, in most provinces any gift you 
made in your will to your former spouse will be cancelled when 
the divorce judgment comes through. If you die without changing 
your will, any gift of specific property you made to your spouse 
will go to an alternate beneficiary you named or (if you didn’t name 
an alternate) fall back into the residue of the estate. If you left the 
residue of your estate to your spouse, it will go to an alternate ben-
eficiary of the residue you named. If you didn’t name an alternate 
(or the alternate has died), the residue will be distributed as if you 

 Chapter 18: Updating Your Estate Plan 307
had died without a will (see Chapter 12). If you named your spouse 
as your executor, the appointment will be cancelled. If you haven’t 
named an alternate executor, you will have to come up with a new 
executor. If you don’t name a new executor, when you die someone 
will have to apply to the court to be made administrator of your 
estate.
If this sounds familiar it’s because when you and your spouse 
divorce, your estate is distributed just as if your former spouse 
had died before you. So, just as with the death of a spouse, you’ll 
have to think about whom your beneficiaries should now be and 
reconsider your tax-planning strategies.
There’s one big difference between death and a divorce. When you 
revise your estate plan following separation or divorce, remember 
to take into account any responsibilities you have under a court 
order or separation agreement — to pay support, for example, or 
to keep your life insured in favour of your spouse or ex-spouse.
If you have children
If you made your present estate plan before you had children, 
you’ll definitely want to revisit it after your first child arrives . . . 
and probably after each additional child arrives — just to make 
sure that your arrangements will cover them properly. (We talk 
more about planning for your children in Chapter 8.)
As your children grow, you’ll find that each has his or her own 
particular needs, and you may want to reconsider your affairs to 
take that into account. One child may need family funding through 
a long university program such as medicine, another may have his 
or her own children when quite young (and quite poor) and need 
extra financial help to look after them. If one of your children has 
major financial requirements, you may want to do what you can to 
balance your arrangements so that your other children are treated 
fairly.
As your children become independent, they may need less from 
you — a share of your estate will be a pleasant windfall, no more. 
Or they may in fact need more, as they struggle to hold down a 
job and raise and educate their own children in a world of rising 
prices. You’ll want to take any grandchildren you have into 
account in your plan as well. They’re probably not your responsi-
bility, but they may require more financial help than their parents 
can give them.
If you develop serious health problems
If your health starts to fail, your income may be affected, as may 
your financial planning priorities. Family relationships may change, 

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date  
308
for better or worse. Your plans for a business that you own may 
change. You may have to sell your home to cover health care 
expenses, or mortgage it to be able to afford necessary renova-
tions. That means that health problems are another cue for you to 
look at your estate plan again.
If a family member develops special needs
If one of your children is born with disabilities, or a family member 
is badly injured in an accident, or your aging spouse requires 
extra care, you have to look your estate plan over to see whether 
it’s adequate to deal with the situation. You may need more life 
insurance because the cost of looking after your family has gone 
up. You may never have thought of setting up a testamentary trust 
or a living trust until now, but it may turn out to be a good idea. 
You may even need to change the testamentary guardian you 
appointed in your will, to ensure that someone who is both willing 
and strong enough will look after a child with mental or physical 
disabilities.
Changes in your residence
A move from anywhere to anywhere else can have an effect on 
your finances and estate. You may find that your income goes 
much further in your new home town — or that you can hardly 
make ends meet on what was formerly a comfortable salary. Your 
new house may cost a lot more and form a bigger chunk of your 
estate than before, or it may cost a lot less and free up income for 
investment. So take out your estate plan for another look.
 
If you leave your executor behind when you move, it may be wise 
to choose a new executor who will be on the scene, geographically 
speaking, when you make your final exit.
A move to another province or another country can involve 
changes in the law as well as changes in your finances. Many pro-
vincial laws affect estate planning. If you move to another prov-
ince, you may find different laws on such matters as
 
✓ The age at which a person can make a will
 
✓ The right of your spouse to claim a minimum share of your 
estate, and what that minimum is
 
✓ The right of your dependants to claim support from your 
estate
 
✓ How your business will be affected by your death
 
✓ How a will, power of attorney, and living will are prepared and 
signed
 
✓ The amount chargeable for probate fees

 Chapter 18: Updating Your Estate Plan 309
The laws governing estates are not the same in the United States 
and other countries as they are in Canada. You may find yourself 
in a country with big death taxes, income and capital gain tax rules 
you’ve never even imagined, completely different rules about your 
spouse’s rights over your estate, and even special succession laws 
for property owners who are not citizens.
If you move to another country you will definitely need profes-
sional advice about things like
 
✓ Whether you need a new will to cover property in the new 
country.
 
✓ What automatic rights your family members (including an 
unmarried spouse) have to share in your estate.
 
✓ Whether beneficiaries living outside the country will receive 
the full amount of any gift you leave them (or whether the local 
government will take something off the top — or even refuse to 
allow property or cash to be sent to another country).
 
✓ What estate tax avoidance or reduction strategies are 
available.
 
✓ What effect your change of residence will have on any 
Canadian pension rights you have factored into your estate 
plan.
You even need to review and revise your estate plan if you buy 
property in another country and live there for only a part of the 
year.
 
After you unpack, arrange a visit with a local lawyer to go over 
your will and estate plan to see if you need to make changes.
 
It’s possible to have more than one will, if you have property in 
more than one country (even if you have property in more than one 
province, in fact). You may decide, after getting professional advice, 
that you need two wills to carry out your estate plan properly.
 
You can get into all kinds of trouble when you try to have more 
than one will, so don’t even think about doing this without the help 
of a lawyer. You have to be careful that your later will in one coun-
try or province does not revoke your earlier will in the other coun-
try or province. And then you must be careful not to give away the 
same property twice.
Finally, the laws relating to preparing and signing a will can differ 
from country to country.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date  
310
Changes in your executor’s life
Your plan is that your executor will outlive you . . . but being 
named an executor is no guarantee of immortality or even of a 
long and healthy life. You will need to name a new executor if the 
person you originally named in your will dies and you haven’t 
named an alternate. You’ll also need to name a new executor if the 
one you have is no longer willing or able to take on the duties of an 
executor.
 
If your executor is already dead when you die and you haven’t 
named an alternate, your executor’s executor will become your 
executor.
If the executor you named is still alive but doesn’t want to take on 
the job when you die, someone among your surviving friends and 
relations will have to apply to court to be made administrator of 
your estate (see Chapter 12) if you don’t name a new executor. If 
an administrator has to be appointed, that will delay administra-
tion and distribution of your estate.
Changes in your financial 
and economic life
Financial and economic changes can have just as much impact on 
your estate plan as do changes in your personal life.
Changes in the nature and value of your property
Over the course of your life — or over the course of a wild week 
on the real estate or stock market — the value of the property you 
own may go way up or down.
The kind of property you own may change. You buy a house one 
day and then the next thing you know you’re retiring and giving up 
home ownership in favour of renting a place in Canada and one in 
Florida. Or you may move from investing in GICs that earn income 
to buying stocks that shoot up in value and leave you with a big 
capital gain.
Whatever financial and economic changes happen, you’ll want to 
rethink your estate plan. You may need to deal with the change 
in the tax bill your estate will have to pay or with the payment of 
debts. For example, you may need to take out more life insurance 
so that debts and taxes don’t wipe out your estate, or you may 

 Chapter 18: Updating Your Estate Plan 311
need to look for different tax-avoidance strategies. You may also 
want to re-think how you’ve divided up your property in your will 
if you’re trying to treat everyone in your family equally.
And you may want to change your executor — if you decide that 
you need someone with more sophisticated business or invest-
ment skills, or if you sadly realize that the high-powered team of 
professionals you appointed will no longer be necessary.
Changes in your business
A business you own, alone or with others, could be a valuable part 
of your estate. (See Chapter 9 for an in-depth discussion of estate 
planning if you own your own business.) You need to keep your 
estate plan in mind whenever your business undergoes a change, 
as in the following examples:
 
✓ When you start up a business or change the form of your 
business (say from a partnership to a corporation), you 
should consider estate planning when you and your associ-
ates negotiate a partnership or shareholder agreement. If you 
want your family to be able either to run the business or to 
sell out profitably after your death, those matters need to be 
addressed in the agreement.
 
✓ If the value of your business changes, you need to think about 
whether your arrangements to pass on its value will be fair to 
everyone in your surviving family. Maybe at one time it was 
fair to leave your house to one child and the proceeds of sale 
of your business to another — but is that true now?
 
✓ If your business enters into the next generation because 
your children are coming on board, you need to think about 
whether your succession arrangements will work properly to 
achieve your and their goals. For example, will the business 
need a shot of cash, best provided by insurance on your life, 
to steady it financially when you die? You also need, once 
again, to think about whether your plans to distribute your 
estate are fair. In your will, should you give everyone a share 
of the business, so they can all taste the profits? Should you 
require your successor to buy all or part of the business from 
the estate so that the successor doesn’t get a windfall at the 
expense of other family members?
You should draft the business-related parts of your will as if you 
were going to die tomorrow, to make sure that your arrangements 
are appropriate for the business as it is now, not as it might be if 
you live for many more years. This approach means you need to 
revise your will as your business circumstances change.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date  
312
Changes in the law
Most of the changes that affect your estate plan will be quite 
noticeable to you. You’ll clue in pretty quickly that you’re getting 
married, having children, divorcing, feuding with relatives, burying 
your executor, or becoming fabulously rich through your business.
Changes in the law are much less noticeable. You might read about 
a new law in the paper — if it’s a slow news day. But it’s just as 
likely that you’ll never hear about the creation or cancellation of 
laws that could be important to your estate plan. Even lawyers 
have to work quite hard to find out what lawmakers have been up 
to lately.
The areas of law that are most likely to have an impact on your 
estate plan and will are tax law, family law, and wills and succes-
sion law.
 
It’s a good idea to check in with your lawyer every few years and 
have him or her go over your estate plan with an eye to changing 
laws. When a very significant change in law occurs, sometimes law-
yers notify their clients and ask them to come in for a chat.
Tax law
The federal Income Tax Act is huge and is constantly being rewrit-
ten. These are some of the many changes that occur on a regular 
basis:
 
✓ Income tax rates change, either up or down.
 
✓ Capital gains tax rates change.
 
✓ Tax reduction opportunities are given and taken away — 
RRSPs, RRIFs, and RESPs are examples of tax reduction oppor-
tunities.
 
✓ Tax breaks are given to businesses or taken away.
Each province also has an income tax act, containing provisions 
that can affect your estate plan.
Family law
In provincial family law, probably the most likely thing to change 
is the rights of one spouse over the property of the other spouse. 
This could mean that your estate will turn out to be smaller or 
larger than you expected (depending on which spouse you are), 
or that your spouse has a larger (or smaller) claim against your 
estate.

 Chapter 18: Updating Your Estate Plan 313
Succession law
The thing to watch for in provincial succession law is a change in 
the definition of a spouse. At the moment, in order to get a share 
in the estate of a partner who dies without a will, in half of the 
provinces a spouse has to be legally married to the partner. In 
other provinces these rights have been extended to partners who 
are unmarried but living together like a married couple for a fixed 
period of time, and in yet others to those who are living together 
and have registered their relationship with the government. Some 
of these changes could eventually find their way into succession 
law in the remaining provinces as well.
Other areas of law
Provincial laws concerning living wills and powers of attorney 
change from time to time. The forms required and the legal for-
malities for completing living wills and powers of attorney undergo 
change every now and then in some provinces. (See Chapter 14 for 
more about powers of attorney and Chapter 15 about living wills.)
Provincial laws about probate fees can also change. (See Chapter 3 
for more about probate fees.)
Changing Your Will
If you decide that you need to make changes in your will to update 
your estate plan, you can either amend your will by making a codi-
cil or you can revoke your will and replace it with a new will.
 
Don’t try to change your will by writing changes on the original 
will. The changes will be easy to attack after your death. You must 
be legally capable of making a will even if you’re just making hand-
written changes to your will, and any changes must be properly 
signed and witnessed — just like a will. If you don’t meet these 
requirements (which we describe in Chapter 13), any changes you 
make have no effect on your will.
Making a codicil
A codicil is a written document that makes a change or changes to 
an existing will. It can add provisions to the will, it can cancel certain 
provisions of the will, or it can cancel certain provisions and substi-
tute new ones. In fact, one codicil could do all of those things, in dif-
ferent parts of the will. It’s possible to have more than one codicil to 
a will. A new codicil can also change existing codicils.

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date  
314
When you sign a codicil you must satisfy the same requirements as 
for the signing of a will (see Chapter 13). For the codicil to be valid,
 
✓ You must be legally capable of making a will. That means, 
generally, that you have to be able to understand what a will 
is and what it does, what property you have, and who might 
have a claim to share in your estate.
 
✓ You must be acting freely, not under threats or violence, or 
under pressure from a person who has a dominant relation-
ship with you.
 
✓ The codicil must be properly signed and witnessed, just like 
a will. You and two witnesses must all be present together 
in the same room and must all sign the codicil and must all 
watch each other sign the codicil. If your lawyer isn’t super-
vising the signing of the codicil, be careful whom you choose 
as a witness. A person who witnesses a codicil is not allowed 
to receive any gifts under the codicil. In most provinces, a 
person whose spouse witnesses the codicil is also not allowed 
to receive any gifts under the codicil.
Once a valid codicil is made, the will and codicil are read together. 
The changes set out in the codicil become part of and change the 
original will.
 
Be sure to let your executor know that you have made a codicil, 
and store your will and codicil together.
A codicil can be challenged in court just as a will can. If a court 
finds that you were not mentally competent when you signed the 
codicil, or you were pressured into making it, or the codicil was 
not properly signed and witnessed, then it won’t be valid and 
won’t have any effect. Your will won’t be changed by the codicil.
Revoking and replacing your will
You can revoke (cancel) your will by physically destroying it. If you 
destroy your will and you don’t make a new will before you die, 
you will die intestate, and provincial intestacy law controls what 
happens to your estate (see Chapter 12).
The better way to cancel your will is to sign a new will that states 
that it revokes any earlier wills. The new will then takes effect 
and your old will is revoked. Most lawyers recommend that you 
destroy your old will after making a new one, to make sure that no 
one tries to probate the old will, either mistakenly or intentionally.

 Chapter 18: Updating Your Estate Plan 315
Choosing between a codicil 
or a new will
People often make a codicil instead of a new will because they 
believe that a lawyer will charge less for preparing a codicil than 
for the preparing a new will. In fact, there may be no difference in 
cost, or only a very small one — especially since almost all lawyers 
keep their clients’ wills in computerized form.
 
It’s fine to use a codicil if your instructions will be clearly under-
stood by someone reading your will and the codicil. But you 
should have a new will prepared if you are making a lot of changes 
to your will, if you already have several codicils, or if using a codi-
cil will make your instructions confusing.
Updating Your Pensions 
and Insurance Policies
Your estate plan almost certainly has more documents hanging 
around it than just a will. When you change your estate plan and 
will, don’t forget about your life insurance policies, pensions, 
RRSPs, or RRIFs. You may want to change the beneficiary or benefi-
ciaries you named earlier.
Life insurance policies
You have the right to change the beneficiary of any life insurance 
policy unless you designated the beneficiary irrevocably, in which 
case you cannot change your beneficiary without the beneficiary’s 
consent. (See Chapter 4 for more about naming a beneficiary of 
your life insurance policy.)
 
If you are divorced or separated, make sure that the terms of your 
separation agreement or a court order don’t prevent you from 
changing your beneficiary.
To change the beneficiary on a life insurance policy, you must sign 
a written document revoking your earlier designation and naming 
a new beneficiary. You can do this by writing and signing a note 

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date  
316
yourself, or you can contact your insurance company to find out if 
it has a form it would like you to use. Or you may change the ben-
eficiary by including a direction to that effect in your will.
 
Be sure to notify your insurance company in writing of the change 
in beneficiary. Otherwise the insurance company may pay out the 
proceeds to the wrong person.
Pension plans
You probably won’t be able to change the beneficiary under your 
pension plan if you have a spouse and/or dependent children.
If you’re a member of a pension plan, when you die your spouse 
(including an unmarried partner of the opposite sex in many plans, 
and even the same sex, in some plans) will be entitled to receive a 
pension or a refund of your contributions plus interest. If you have 
dependent children, they may be entitled to receive a pension 
either immediately or on the death of your spouse.
As long as you have a spouse (and in some plans, dependent 
children), you cannot direct your pension plan to pay a pension 
or refund to anyone else. If you do not have a spouse (or in some 
plans, dependent children), under some plans you may name a 
beneficiary to receive a pension or a lump sum payment. Under 
other plans, this payment will be made to your estate. If you’re 
permitted to name a beneficiary for your pension plan, you’re also 
permitted to change the beneficiary. Contact the administrator of 
your pension plan to find out what forms you must complete to 
name or change a beneficiary.
If you and your spouse separate or divorce, the value of your pen-
sion may be the subject of negotiations when you and your spouse 
divide up your property. You and your spouse may decide to trade 
the value of your pension rights against the value of other property 
you own, or you may decide to split the pension benefits them-
selves. Most provincial and federal pension benefits laws allow 
pension rights to be divided between the spouses according to the 
provisions of a separation agreement or court order. Contact the 
administrator of your pension plan to find out what your plan per-
mits you to do and how you go about doing it.
RRSPs and RRIFs
You have the right to change the beneficiary of your RRSP or RRIF. 
Contact the bank, trust company, or other plan administrator to 
find out what forms you must complete to change your beneficiary.

 Chapter 18: Updating Your Estate Plan 317
Revising Your Power of Attorney 
and Living Will
With all this upheaval in your life, your power of attorney and 
living will may require some attention too.
Power of attorney
When you revisit your power of attorney, ask yourself whether you 
still want the same attorney, and whether he or she is still willing 
and able to take on an attorney’s duties.
Generally, powers of attorney can be revoked by tearing up the 
original. In some provinces you must revoke your power of attor-
ney by a written document that is formally signed and witnessed.
 
If you revoke a power of attorney, you should notify your attorney 
in writing and also ask for the return of the original power of attor-
ney document (if your attorney has it). If your attorney has been 
dealing with anyone on your behalf, such as your bank or your 
stockbroker, be sure to write to those people telling them that the 
power of attorney has been revoked.
After you’ve revoked your power of attorney, remember to make a 
new one!
Living will
The changes in your life that prompted you to review your estate 
plan may affect your thinking about your choice of substitute deci-
sion maker and the instructions you put in your living will. (See 
Chapter 15.)
If you made your living will while you were healthy and you’re now 
suffering from a particular disease or condition, you’ll want to find 
out what medical treatment is available. You may want to rewrite 
your living will to give instructions relating specifically to treat-
ment for that disease or condition.
Don’t forget to revise your living will if something happens to your 
substitute decision maker. If you’ve got a living will but no substi-
tute decision maker, one of your relatives, in an order set out by 

Part V: Readying Your Estate and Keeping It Up to Date  
318
the province (spouse first, then adult child, then a parent, and so 
on), will be called on to act as your substitute decision maker.
 
If you make a change to your living will, be sure to retrieve any 
copies of the older version from your substitute decision maker, 
doctor, lawyer, family members, or any others. Remember to give 
your up-to-date living will to your substitute decision maker and to 
your doctor.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part…
T
his part is the famous Part of Tens! We offer you 10 
questions to ask before you hire a lawyer, and 10 
ways to use the Internet when you’re planning your estate.

Chapter 19
Ten Questions to Ask Before 
You Hire a Lawyer
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the questions to ask a lawyer
▶ Knowing what to ask yourself
A
 good lawyer is the most important member of your estate 
planning team. The following ten questions address the most 
important matters in choosing a lawyer. The first nine questions 
are for the lawyer. The last one is for you.
Ask the Lawyer
How much experience do you have in estate planning and estate 
administration?
You want a lawyer who’s already experienced in the kind of work 
you need done. You don’t want to be a lawyer’s work-study project.
Does the lawyer have experience in preparing wills, powers of attor-
ney, and living wills? How long has the lawyer been doing this kind 
of work? How many wills has the lawyer prepared? Does the lawyer 
have experience in planning estates of the same value and with the 
same types of property as yours? Is the lawyer willing to seek the 
help of outside specialists such as tax accountants if necessary?
Your executor will probably ask the lawyer who prepared your 
will for help in administering the estate, so you’d also like some 
information on behalf of your executor. Does the lawyer have expe-
rience in working with executors in administering estates? How 
many estates has the lawyer administered?

Part VI: The Part of Tens  
322
How will you charge me for the work you do, and how much will 
you charge me?
A lawyer may bill you at an hourly rate for the time spent working 
for you, or charge a flat rate for preparing your will, power of attor-
ney, and living will.
If the lawyer is going to charge you by the hour, find out what the 
hourly rate is and how long the lawyer estimates the work will 
take. Once you hire the lawyer, he or she has to get your agree-
ment to raise the hourly rate, and has to tell you (and get your 
agreement) before going past the estimate.
If the lawyer is going to charge you a flat fee, find out how much 
time the lawyer is willing to spend with you for that fee. Ask what 
the lawyer will do if he or she needs to spend more time with you.
Ask if the lawyer will want you to pay a retainer (a deposit paid 
before the work is done that is applied against the bill), and if so, 
how much.
Will you be doing the work on my estate plan personally, or will 
the work be done by others?
Unless the lawyer is a sole practitioner with no employees, some-
one else will be doing at least some of the work, even if it’s just 
the typing and photocopying. If the lawyer works in a firm, other 
lawyers, articling students, or law clerks may be involved. There’s 
not necessarily anything wrong with that, but you should know 
up front whom you’re hiring. You may want to know more about 
and perhaps even meet these other players, depending on how 
involved they’re likely to be.
How long will it take before my documents are ready for me to 
sign?
Perhaps you have reasons for wanting your estate plan put into 
place very soon: you may be getting married, going on a trip, or 
undergoing surgery; or you may have been recently diagnosed 
with a life-threatening illness. Even without specific reasons, you 
probably want everything wrapped up sooner rather than later.
 
Some lawyers are better at taking on work than at actually getting 
it done. Tell the lawyer when you would like the work completed, 
and ask if he or she can have it done by then.

 Chapter 19: Ten Questions to Ask Before You Hire a Lawyer 323
Will you explain the documents to me in detail before I sign 
them?
Understanding what a will says can be very difficult. You want a 
lawyer who’s willing to take the time to translate your will into 
English and answer any questions you might have.
Will I have to come back to your office?
Some lawyers make house calls for estate planning clients who are 
older or unwell and find it hard to get out to a lawyer’s office.
If you have to come back, how many times will you have to come 
back? Just once to sign the documents? Or for another one or 
more meetings to give the lawyer information and/or to discuss 
your estate plan before the lawyer prepares the documents?
Will you hold my will, power of attorney, and living will for 
safekeeping?
Most lawyers have a vault in which they keep their clients’ estate 
planning documents. Some lawyers provide safe storage of docu-
ments for free, others charge a fee.
Whether or not the lawyer charges a fee for holding your docu-
ments, find out whether there will be an administrative fee charged 
to your executor or family members for locating your documents 
and releasing them.
Will you keep me up to date on changes in the law that might 
affect my estate plan?
Some law firms send out regular newsletters to their clients to 
keep them advised of developments in the law on any number of 
topics. Even if the lawyer’s firm does not do so, the lawyer you hire 
should notify you of any changes in the law that might cause you 
to rethink and revise your estate plan.
How often should I review my estate plan with you, and what 
will it cost?
Ask the lawyer what changes in your circumstances should cause 
you to talk to him or her about possible changes to your estate 
plan. The lawyer should also suggest that you have a look at your 
estate plan every few years, and then contact him or her if you 
think changes are necessary.

Part VI: The Part of Tens  
324
The lawyer will probably tell you that the cost of reviewing your 
estate plan will depend on how much time it takes to do the 
review, and then how much, if anything, needs changing. He or she 
should be able to give you some kind of idea of how much it would 
cost to
 
✓ Simply review your estate plan
 
✓ Prepare a codicil to your will
 
✓ Replace your will, power of attorney, and/or living will
Then Ask Yourself
Ask the questions we’ve set out before you choose a lawyer. Listen 
to the answers carefully — not just to what the lawyer says, but 
to how the lawyer says it. And then you need to ask yourself a 
question.
Do I want to work with this lawyer?
Listen to your instincts — do you feel comfortable with this 
lawyer? Do you like this lawyer? Does this lawyer treat you with 
courtesy and respect?
Were you kept waiting for your appointment or were you ushered 
into the lawyer’s office right on time? Did the lawyer act as though 
he or she was doing you a favour by meeting with you or were you 
made to feel welcome? Did the lawyer allow interruptions by tele-
phone calls and visits from staff during your meeting or was your 
meeting quiet and uninterrupted? Did the lawyer make a point of 
explaining things to you in an understandable way or did he or 
she treat you like a child or a moron because you don’t know a lot 
about law?
If you like the answers to all of the questions you asked the lawyer 
and yourself, then you’re ready to say, “You’re hired!”
