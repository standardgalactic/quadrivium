Millions of students in this country are terrified of math. They do 
whatever they can to avoid numbers and math problems as if they 
were the plague. In school, they put off taking math as long as possi-
ble. And when given the choice, they select majors requiring little or 
no math. If they do have to take the subject, they dread entering the 
classroom, let alone taking an exam. One young student described 
how she panicked in math class to the point that she would run out 
of the room and vomit uncontrollably. As a child, she often had night-
mares about numbers chasing her, wanting to hurt her.
	
High levels of anxiety can devastate a student’s ability to per-
form, resulting in poor academic progress and high dropout rates. 
Research among college students has shown math generates anxiety 
reactions among students who are not necessarily highly anxious in 
other situations. One study at a large midwest university disclosed 
one-third of all students who requested behavioral counseling com-
plained of anxiety related to math.
	
As a college counselor, I’ve seen hundreds of students each se-
mester who fear math or do their best to avoid taking it. In fact, I 
believe there are people in all walks of life who are math anxious. In-
variably, when I’m at social functions or at meetings, people confide 
in me about their math woes. They often tell me math has always 
been their biggest problem in school. They say things such as: “If it 
weren’t for math, I’d be going to school right now.” “I’d be making a 
career change.” “I’d be more successful than I am right now.” “I’d go 
back to school and get that degree I always wanted.” And on and on.
	
Widely reported studies have shown math serves as a “critical 
filter” in determining many educational, vocational, and professional 
P R E F A C E

options (National Research Council, 1998; Sells, 1978). Math avoiders 
are finding themselves shut out of today’s most rewarding and profit-
able careers.
	
College algebra is a minimum math requirement for a bachelor’s 
degree at almost all undergraduate institutions. At the community 
college level, we see many students who can’t possibly meet this math 
requirement, either because they had poor math backgrounds to be-
gin with or because they’ve been out of school so long they’ve forgot-
ten what they once knew. Often, these students must take four math 
courses just to meet this university requirement for their major. They 
need to take fundamentals of math—a course reviewing percentages, 
decimals, and fractions—before they can go on to take beginning al-
gebra, intermediate algebra, and finally, college algebra. For students 
who are afraid of math, this is a living nightmare. Furthermore, the 
news media increasingly point out that the majority of Ph.D. degrees 
in science and engineering given in this country are being awarded to 
foreign-born graduates who, presumably, are more comfortable with 
math than U.S. graduates.
	
Why is math such a problem for Americans? How can we fully 
understand this problem? What can be done to overcome the dev-
astating effects of math anxiety and math avoidance? I’ve designed 
this workbook to answer these questions.
	
Conquering Math Anxiety: A Self-Help Workbook presents a com-
prehensive, multifaceted treatment approach to reduce math anxiety 
and math avoidance. This unique, carefully outlined methodology 
involves anxiety management and reduction, reduction of internal 
psychological stumbling blocks, attitude changing, confidence build-
ing, “Success in Math Visualizations,” learning-style enhancements, 
­problem-solving strategies, and effective study and test-taking skills. 
In addition, it teaches winning strategies for overcoming test anxiety 
on math exams. This workbook provides detailed explanations along 
with a host of varied exercises, methods, and worksheets for helping 
math-anxious students deal with and overcome math fears. 
	
The CD accompanying this workbook contains recordings of my 
favorite and most powerful relaxation and visualization exercises 
for reducing math anxiety. I’ve used these exercises successfully for 
many years with math-anxious students, both in my classes and in 
counseling.
xii    P R E F A C E

	
Although Conquering Math Anxiety is based on my experience at 
the community college level, my primary purpose in writing it is to 
reach all math-anxious individuals. Many are attending ­universities, 
community colleges, or high schools. Many are no longer in school 
but find that math fears continue to interfere with the pursuit of 
their personal goals, often creating lowered self-esteem, frustration, 
or dissatisfaction.
	
Because this workbook is comprehensive in its scope, it is rel-
evant for people at any educational level or in any career. It is de-
signed so the reader can simply jump in and draw from it as little or 
as much as he or she needs.
	
No prerequisites are needed for completing the activities in this 
workbook. Mathematics anxiety can be found at any math level, 
from the fundamentals of math through statistics and beyond. I’ve 
even had students taking calculus simultaneously enrolled in my 
math anxiety reduction course.
	
Conquering Math Anxiety uses the analogy of a road map detailing 
the route to math success, but its individual chapters are like recipes 
that can be extracted and used entirely on their own according to 
need. For this reason, the workbook and CD are useful by themselves 
or as supplements to any mathematics course in which a student or 
teacher identifies a problem area impeding smooth progress.
	
My background as a college counselor, teacher, and workshop 
trainer leads me to speak directly to those with whom I work and to 
involve them thoroughly in the learning process. Therefore, I have 
included a maximum number of exercises. Also, throughout the book, 
I address the reader in the first person. After first analyzing the roots 
of math anxiety, I detail specific techniques for managing anxiety and 
overcoming psychological barriers to math. This leads to the critical 
importance of reversing negative “math self-talk,” creating positive 
attitudes, and building self-confidence. The section on math success 
visualization is unique. It helps readers reprogram their thinking to 
promote math success. Then I focus on learning styles, study skills, 
and problem-solving approaches as they apply specifically to math. 
The workbook ends with an in-depth look into techniques for conquer-
ing math test anxiety and an analysis of the importance of mathemat-
ics in all aspects of life. Interspersed throughout the workbook you 
will find humorous cartoons with a positive slant.

Acknowledgments
I am extremely grateful to those who have assisted me in the de-
velopment of the ideas presented in this workbook: the many math-
­anxious students I have counseled and taught, my colleagues who 
shared ideas and teaching suggestions, and my family and friends 
who offered support and assistance.
	
This work would not have been possible if not for the many won-
derful students I have worked with over the years—both in counsel-
ing sessions and in the math anxiety reduction courses and work-
shops I have taught. In the process of helping them deal with math 
anxiety, I have learned much and now feel privileged to be able to 
share this knowledge with others. My students have been my teach-
ers, and I would like to thank each and every one of them.
	
The most important person in the development and writing of this 
book has been my husband, Arnold Arem, M.D. His many hours of 
dedication to this project have been invaluable to me. To each of the 
ideas presented here he listened carefully and gave his thoughtful 
xvi    P R E F A C E

Preface   xvii
critique. He read and reread my manuscript at each stage of its de-
velopment and offered me counsel, detailed editing advice, and much 
needed emotional support. I am particularly delighted that he devel-
oped the ideas for the lighthearted cartoons that appear in this work. 
	
I would also like to thank my daughter, Kimba, for the beautiful, 
relaxing music she composed for the CD accompanying this work-
book. Her caring input has been an inspiration. I also extend my sin-
cere appreciation to my son, Keith, and to PCB Productions for their

The Road Map to Success
I N T R O D U C T I O N
Have you ever found yourself lost, in a strange or unfamiliar place, 
without a map to guide you? Did you suddenly feel alone? Did you 
feel scared, not knowing what to do or which way to turn? Perhaps 
you stopped to ask for directions, but they were confusing, mis-
guided, or incomprehensible. If the hour was growing late, you might 
have felt a sense of menace or dread. Perhaps you began to perspire, 
your muscles tightened, your pulse quickened, your breathing be-
came more rapid, and all your senses heightened, trying to detect if 
danger was present.
	
Now let’s imagine for a moment you were miraculously given 
a detailed map of the area, not only showing where you were but 
also providing explicit instructions for reaching any destination you 
chose. Every step along the way was made clear, every turn and 
­every landmark carefully spelled out and described. Your map left 
no stone unturned, no shadow of a doubt as to what direction to take 
and how to proceed. Wouldn’t such a map have made your journey 
less stressful, more pleasurable, and helped guarantee success in 
reaching your goal?
	
Is dealing with math like being lost in an unfamiliar or strange 
place? Do you sometimes feel as if you’re all alone, no one understands 
what you’re going through, and others’ efforts to help are confusing 
or misleading? When doing math, do you ever feel scared, panicky, or 
have a sense of dread or impending doom—not knowing which way to 
turn or where to get the assistance you so desperately need?
 
Let me assure you that you are not alone. There are many people 
who have felt the same way at one time or another. Students often de-
scribe feelings of devastating failure and utter defeat when it comes to 
xix

xx    C O N T E N T S
doing math. Mathematical reasoning and numbers are their nemesis 
and have been for much of their school lives. They shun exposure to 
math as if it were a frightening, unknown danger. Whenever possible, 
they purposely avoid any subject requiring math and choose majors 
requiring little or preferably no math. In math classes or even in math 
tutoring sessions, their minds turn off and they become lost, compre-
hending little of what is explained or taught.
	
If you are one of these students—lost, feeling alone, apprehensive, 
shunning math—you have come to the right place. I have written this 
workbook specifically for you. I’ve designed it to be your personal, 
detailed map to help you find your way, to aid you in overcoming your 
fear of math, and to ensure that you achieve success in math. Included 
are detailed explanations and exercises all along your path to illumi-
nate your journey and to make it easier and more fulfilling.
	
As you follow this road map, you will find many important branch 
points to explore and experience. We begin our journey in Chapter 1 
by first discovering whether you really have math anxiety, and then 
we analyze your math success goal. From there, we’ll look at where 
your math fears and anxieties initially began and why they have 
­persisted.
 
Chapter 2 asks you to look at your math anxiety history and iden-
tify the factors that influenced you as well as the myths, stereotypes, 
or games that might have affected you. By diagraming the math 
anxiety process, you can see how previous negative math experiences 
combined with negative self-talk lead to overwhelming anxieties and 
fears.
 
In Chapter 3, you learn how anxiety affects your memory and ways 
to control and manage anxiety so it can work for you and not against 
you. You learn how high, uncontrolled anxiety levels lead to panic and 
the inability to perform, whereas moderate, properly managed anxiety 
marshals optimal performance, good memory, and clear thinking.
 
Chapter 4 explores how you deal with problems that arise in your 
life and how your coping methods can aid or hinder your efforts to 
overcome math anxiety. The Wall Fantasy is designed to increase your 
awareness of what you may be doing to impede your success in math. 
We also assess your math self-concept.
	
Next, in Chapter 5, we look at the importance of attitudes and 
ways of changing negative attitudes toward math to positive ones. I

guide you through exercises to help you develop positive, enhancing 
self-dialogue related to math and your ability to do math.
	
Then our journey takes us to the very exciting area of “Success 
in Math” imagery. Research has shown that positive mental imagery 
can greatly improve the status of our lives mentally, emotionally, and 
physically. In Chapter 6, you are given excellent visualization tech-
niques to achieve your math goals. You are guided through a beauti-
ful imagery technique that has already advanced the lives of many 
hundreds of math students who overcame the same math anxieties 
that you have been experiencing. You will also find this exercise re-
corded on the accompanying CD.
	
Chapter 7 looks at your math learning style. Through the use of 
carefully chosen questions, you are asked to assess the critical fac-
tors influencing your ability to learn math. Whether you are a visual, 
auditory, or kinesthetic/tactile learner, a sequential or global learner, 
or a deductive or inductive learner, this chapter offers you sugges-
tions for enhancing your learning.
	
From here, the path leads directly into Chapter 8, where we ex-
amine useful math study skills and winning strategies for learning 
math and reading math textbooks.
	
Chapter 9, one of the most important in this road map, teaches 
you how to deal with test anxiety and how to perform your best on 
math exams. It reviews test preparation and test-taking strategies 
as well as good nutritional guidelines to follow before exams. This 
chapter contains a powerful visualization exercise to help you feel 
alert, clear, calm, confident, and competent on exams. You will also 
find this exercise recorded on the accompanying CD.
 
Chapter 10 explores problem-solving approaches and ways to 
“think like a mathematician.” We end the journey with Chapter 11, a 
look at your exciting math future.
	
A special music and dialogue CD accompanies this workbook. It 
was produced to help you experience some of the wonderful calming 
and visualization techniques described in this workbook. The Calm-
ing Breath and the Deep Abdominal Breath both focus on calming 
your mind and body. The “Success in Math Visualization” will help 
you reprogram yourself to succeed in math, and the “Math Test 
Anxiety Reduction Visualization” will take you through a powerful 
technique to help you achieve success on math exams.
The Road Map to Success   xxi

Some Basic Axioms
In this workbook, I present a comprehensive, well-tested plan for 
tackling your math fears and anxieties. My approach is based on the 
following premises:
 
• As a student, you need not be forever burdened by the nega-
tive experiences or unproductive messages from your past.
 
• You can learn to manage stress and anxiety physiologically so 
they can be productive rather than destructive aspects of your 
academic performance.
 
• By changing negative math self-talk to positive self-talk, you 
can greatly improve your ability to deal with math.
 
• Learning how to maintain a positive attitude toward math 
and toward your ability to do math has a tenfold beneficial ef-
fect on your math performance.
 
• By using visualization techniques, you can reprogram yourself 
to succeed in math.
 
• You can increase your ability to learn math by using more 
appropriate, effective, and efficient study skills and learning-
style strategies.
 
• Conquering math test anxiety is like winning the battle.
 
• Math can actually begin to be fun and exciting for you!
Guidelines for Using This Workbook
Here are a few suggestions to help you maximize the benefits of the 
exercises in this workbook:
	
1.	 Give yourself some uninterrupted time. Set aside a special time 
and place where you will not be distracted or interrupted. 
Even if you have only 5 or 10 minutes, make sure it is a pri-
vate time just for you. Unplug the phone if necessary. Put a 
note on your bedroom door saying you can’t be disturbed for a 
few minutes.
 
2. Work alone and in silence. You will be able to gain greater self-
understanding and insights if you work alone and don’t pre-
maturely share your new perceptions with others. There will 
xxii    I N T R O D U C T I O N

The Road Map to Success   xxiii
be plenty of time later, after completing your work, for you to 
discuss what you’ve learned. I encourage you to share your 
insights with supportive people, such as friends, teachers, or a 
counselor. They may make your journey easier.
 
3. Keep a math journal. You will probably find it helpful to keep 
a journal in which you write about the new awareness, sensi-
tivities, and insights you gain. This may be similar to Exercise 
2-3 (Chapter 2), or it may be in the form of a traditional diary.
 
4. Assume a comfortable position. Sit quietly, with your eyes 
closed, in a slightly darkened room when listening to the CD 
or taking yourself through the anxiety management exercises 
in Chapter 3, the Wall Fantasy in Chapter 4, the “Success in 
Math Visualization” in Chapter 6, and the “Math Test Anxiety 
Reduction Visualization” exercise in Chapter 9. Be sure to ar-
range to be alone and undisturbed so you attain the full ben-
efit of these experiences.
	
5.	 Be persistent. The road to success can be achieved only through 
staying power, resolve, and determination. “Stick-to-it-tive-
ness” will help you reach your math goal. You must master 
many steppingstones along the way: from learning how to 
reduce anxiety to overcoming psychological stumbling blocks; 
from rewriting disempowering math beliefs to reprogramming 
yourself to succeed in math; from learning to use effective 
math study skills to conquering math test anxiety. It will take 
time and patience. So persevere, stay with it, and you’ll con-
quer your math fears and anxieties.
	
6.	 Be positive. Know in your heart and mind that you can and 
will succeed. Have faith that you are able to achieve in life 
what you realistically desire and work toward. Your persistent, 
positive efforts can and will be rewarded. I’ve seen it happen for 
others who have conquered math anxiety. Why not you?
	
7.	 Jump in and start anywhere. Although I have written this 
workbook as a detailed road map to help you reach your math 
success goal, you need not progress through the workbook in 
sequence. As much as possible, each chapter stands indepen-
dently of the others. Thus, you may wish to work mainly on 
those areas that concern you the most.

Summary
Conquering Math Anxiety: A Self-Help Workbook offers you a detailed 
road map laying out all the steps along the route to overcome math 
anxiety and ultimately to achieve success in math. Many students 
have taken this route before you and have succeeded. So can you!

Do You Really Have  
Math Anxiety?
1
Do not worry too much about your difficulties in mathematics. I can assure 
you mine are still greater. —Albert Einstein
Labeling yourself “math anxious” is almost like having “medical  
student’s disease,” a common phenomenon among medical students. 
They diagnose themselves with a devastating disease based on hav-
ing even one manifestation of the disorder.
	
Not unlike a disease, math anxiety has clear-cut symptoms. 
These symptoms include negative emotional, mental, and/or physical 
reactions to mathematical thought processes and problem solving 
caused by discomforting or unrewarding life experiences with math.
	
The anxiety, fear, and blocking behavior you have with math may 
not be primarily due to math. Although these reactions appear to arise 
in your math class or on a math test, they may not be caused by math 
itself. Math acts like a fine magnifying lens, bringing into sharp focus 
a host of other academic deficiencies, like poor study skills, knowledge 
gaps, or inadequate test preparations or test-taking skills. The anxi-
ety you express about math thus becomes a symptom and not the 
disease itself. So you may not actually have “the math anxiety dis-
ease,” although you are experiencing some of its symptoms.
	
Often, students who believe they are math anxious in reality are 
merely victims of test anxiety. Jonathan, an 18-year-old, is a perfect 
example of this. He sought counseling from me, distraught because 
he was failing math but felt he really knew the material. He was 
sure his poor performance was due to a math block or perhaps a 

2    C H A P T E R   1   
deep-seated fear of math. Upon questioning Jonathan, it was obvi-
ous he did know his math. But when he went into an exam, he would 
totally “blank out.” Sometimes, it was as if he couldn’t even add two 
numbers together without making a mistake. I learned he occasion-
ally blanked out or panicked on exams in other subjects as well. 
Halfway through a chemistry exam, he panicked and began making 
all sorts of errors on problems he really knew how to answer. He also 
found himself anxious and perspiring a lot during his psychology fi-
nal and ended up ruining his chances for an A in the course.
	
If you are like Jonathan, panicking on math tests as well as on 
exams in other subjects, the help you need is primarily in the area of 
overcoming test anxiety. A reduction in the high levels of generalized 
anxiety you experience when taking tests will increase your ability 
to perform, not only in math but in all your courses. Chapter 9 in 
this workbook, entitled “Conquering Test Anxiety,” is an excellent 
chapter to study. It will give you tried-and-true strategies to prepare 
for tests, take tests, deal with the anxiety, and use visualization 
techniques to ensure successful results.

Do You Really Have Math Anxiety?   3
	
I have also worked with other students who were not truly math 
anxious but whose academic difficulties severely affected their abil-
ity to succeed in math. Perhaps you are one of these students. For 
example, you could easily find yourself feeling overwhelmed, anx-
ious, and “over your head” in a math course if, unknowingly, you 
missed important preparatory coursework along the way. You may 
be surprised to learn your anxiety in math might abruptly end if 
only you were properly placed in an appropriate math class or were 
to receive remedial help in your deficient areas. I have worked with 
many students who experienced severe anxieties in college alge-
bra because of sizable knowledge gaps in their math background, 
despite the fact they never skipped a semester of beginning or in-
termediate algebra. Upon further examination, I learned, although 
these students had never actually missed any classes, they strug-
gled with basic algebraic concepts like graphing a line or solving 
fractional and quadratic equations. For these students, it was like 
taking German 4 when they had missed learning how to conjugate 
verbs in German 2. They were simply ill prepared for their current 
course. They had good reason to be anxious.
	
If you have missed information along the way, it’s almost impos-
sible to expect to clearly understand any subject. Learning math 
is very similar to learning a foreign language, with new terms and 
meanings for words and letters, but it is also similar in that the 
early courses are designed to provide the grammar and syntax for 
later courses. Each course builds upon the previous ones. Early math 
courses also provide the “grammar and syntax” of what is to come 
later—that is, it’s the “language” of math. In math, in particular, 
each step is an essential steppingstone for the next. When construct-
ing a large, impressive skyscraper, we must be sure the foundation 
is strong and sturdy. And as we go higher and higher in math, it is 
like building a tall, elegant structure. If you have missed important 
knowledge along the way, you may have to go back, find those miss-
ing blocks, and reconstruct your building. Once you do this and your 
building stands on a solid foundation, you’ll find math really can be-
come both rewarding and fun.
	
Fine, you say, but how do you accomplish this? There are a 
number of options open to you. If the gaps in your knowledge are 

4    C H A P T E R   1   
­substantial, you should consider actually repeating or, if possible, 
auditing some of the math courses you have already taken in the 
past. Many community colleges offer developmental math courses, 
such as the fundamentals of math and beginning algebra. Also, 
often available are courses that are modularized or separated into 
smaller units so that you can elect to take only the necessary unit(s) 
to fill in your background. I’ve met students who were deficient in 
some specific information taught in the latter part of Algebra 1 and 
who were delighted to learn they were able to register for just the 
third module of an Algebra 1 course at our college.
	
Ellen is another student who wasn’t truly math anxious but 
whose academic difficulties affected her ability to do math. Ellen 
understood her math when it was presented in class, but when 
she sat down to do her homework 2 days later, it reminded her of 
hieroglyphics, mysterious and undecipherable. She fell behind in 
her class work, and soon she became distraught with math. At this 
point, Ellen came to me, convinced she was math anxious. When she 
described how she studied math, that she failed to review her math 
immediately after class and didn’t make up her own practice exams 
(among other things), I was sure Ellen’s problems were related to 
poor study and test-preparation skills and not to math anxiety. I 
spent several sessions with Ellen and taught her good study strate-
gies. Soon Ellen’s grades—and her comfort level—began to improve. 
If your discomfort in math is related to poor study skills or inad-
equate test preparation, Chapters 8 and 9 in this book can help you.
Goals for Success
Before we continue, let’s be very clear about what you want to 
achieve. What are your goals for success in math? If you’re taking a 
math class now, what do you want to get out of it? What does success 
in math mean to you? Goals are like anchors to the future we desire. 
We must toss them out in front of us and then use them to pull our-
selves along. In this way, you take control of your math future. Your 
math success will happen by your design and not by chance. You can 
have the math success you want!

Do You Really Have Math Anxiety?   5
	
In Exercise 1-1, I’d like you to identify what you wish to achieve 
in math. You may have a short- or long-term goal. Write down your 
goal and be specific. For example, you might have a short-term goal 
such as: “I want to solve quadratic equations,” or “I want to learn 
how to work out the word problems in my math book,” or “I want 
to successfully complete my Calculus 1 course this semester.” Long-
term goals might be: “I want to progress through my algebra courses 
and through calculus at a reasonable pace over the next 2 years” or 
“I want to enroll in a math course next fall and complete it with at 
least a C grade.” It’s important for you to be certain, without a doubt, 
this is the goal you wish to achieve and to present it without alter-
natives. The less conflicted you are about achieving your goal, the 
greater the probability you’ll accomplish it.
	
Next, put down a target date for when you plan to reach your 
math success goal. This is the date you think you realistically can 
achieve your goal. Some students find it’s best to set three dates, one 
being the most optimistic date, one being a more moderate and real-
istic date, and the third being the latest acceptable date.
	
The third part of the exercise asks you to evaluate the strength of 
your goal to help you to determine how strongly you are motivated to 
achieve it and what its value is to you.
	
In the fourth part of this plan, establish the benefits you will get 
when you reach your goal. List both the tangible as well as intangi-
ble benefits; sometimes, the intangible ones are more important than 
the tangible ones. For example, Remy wrote that success in reaching 
her math goal would make her feel better about herself and help her 
to know, one day, she could be successful as an architect. For Carl, 
success in math would prove to himself his seventh-grade teacher 
was totally wrong when he said Carl would never be able to do well 
in math.
	
In the fifth part of the exercise, identify some of the obstacles you 
may face along your path, as well as steps you may be able to take 
to overcome these obstacles. Miguel, a college freshman, identified 
one of the major barriers to his success in math: poor study skills. He 
decided to research the best study strategies for improving his math 
and to take a special math study-skills workshop offered at his col-
lege. Emily’s major obstacle was her own negative and embarrassing 

6    C H A P T E R   1   
past history with math, which loomed over her like a large, dark rain 
cloud. She knew this stopped her progress and she had to take some 
drastic steps to deal with it. Emily decided she needed to seek coun-
seling to work on her poor self-esteem.
	
In part six of the exercise, look at the barriers and the possible 
steps required to overcome these barriers; then discern the positive 
forces and abilities you can use or strengthen to meet your goal. 
Jasmine noted in her plan that she has lots of determination, she is 
motivated, and she is willing to work hard. Chan felt his good study 
habits and ability to overcome obstacles were his biggest ­assets.
	
Next, specify the supportive people in your life who can help you 
on the road to success in math. Who are these people, and how will 
they be able to help? Perhaps you have a teacher who encourages 
you, a friend who is a great math tutor, or a companion who is par-
ticularly reassuring.
	
In the eighth section of this plan, I ask you to select the signifi-
cant action steps you are ready to take to meet your math success 
goal. Include here the measures you think will work best. For ex-
ample, you may explore the availability of math tutorial programs or 
decide to work on a specific number of math problems at each study 
session. Many of these steps you will be aware of only as you contin-
ue to read further in this book. As you read, be sure to occasionally 
return to this list and add relevant steps to it to further personalize 
this plan for you. For each action step, list a specific target date by 
which you will accomplish it.
	
The last section of this plan asks you to determine how you will 
reward yourself for meeting your goal. The reward is a very impor-
tant part of this plan. It will help keep your motivation high and 
sustain your effort along the path to success. I’ve seen all types of 
rewards described on finished plans, from a night out on the town to 
a trip to a favorite vacation spot to buying a special gift for yourself. 
Remember to give yourself a reward at the successful accomplish-
ment of your goal. You deserve it!

Summary
In this section of our road map, I have asked: Do you really have 
math anxiety? We’ve seen that much of the fear and discomfort as-
sociated with math is often the result of a host of other academic 
difficulties. You were asked: What does successful accomplishment 
in math mean to you? I’ve encouraged you to explore your goals for 
math success and to develop a plan for achieving them.

Juanita has been math anxious as far back as she can remember. 
She hates math. She dreads it. She avoids any contact she could pos-
sibly have with numbers. Where did it all begin, I wondered. I asked 
Juanita to write her math autobiography so we could get some in-
sight into the roots of her problem. And there it was. The mystery of 
her great fears lay in front of me in black and white. Juanita wrote:
I remember I was in grade school, and I loved it. But 
the nuns were very strict. And one day I had to go to 
the bathroom real bad. I raised my hand to ask, but 
the teacher didn’t wait for me to ask for permission to 
leave; instead I was called to the chalkboard to com-
plete a math problem. And there at the board I lost 
control of my bladder. It was awful. Right in front of 
the whole class. I’ve hated math ever since.
	
Ousmane’s math autobiography revealed his math anxiety didn’t 
begin until middle school. He was taking a prealgebra class and hav-
ing difficulty understanding several of the concepts. He wrote:
My teacher became so angry with me, he yelled at 
me in class, saying I’d never be able to do math. And 
he was right. Ever since that time math has been my 
worst subject. I’d avoid it now if I could, but I need it 
for my major.
	
John remembered needing help with his math homework in third 
grade. His older brother began to help him and tried to explain some 
of the concepts. When John still had difficulty understanding these 
concepts, his older brother beat him up. John made up his mind at 
The Math Anxiety Process
C  H  A  P  T  E  R

14    C H A P T E R   2
the time never to learn math again. He was 45 years old when he 
came to me and said, “I’m ready to begin learning math.”
	
Rachel had a lot of difficulty in her fifth-grade math class. She 
wrote in her math autobiography:
My teacher was so frustrated with my asking so many 
questions in class that every time she taught math she 
had me sit in the hallway outside of class. She said I 
was a hopeless case and I couldn’t learn math anyway.
	
As unbelievable as these cases sound, they are all true examples 
of students who have come to me for math anxiety counseling. The 
negative situations they encountered were very painful and discour-
aging. These students, and perhaps many of you, have had the mis-
fortune to encounter unkind people who do not help foster positive 
math feelings. These people did not act in your best interest. They 
were unkind to blossoming math skills. They are not the best teach-
ers and guides. They often perpetuate a negative and untrue belief 
about your ability to learn math. But despite it all, you persist. You 
continue on your journey in the noble pursuit of learning math. You, 
and only you, have the power to change your life.
	
The techniques I describe in this workbook and on the CD have 
helped these students overcome their fears and successfully accom-
plish their math goals. My strong message to them—and to you—is 
that your past negative math experiences needn’t continue to burden 
you. I encourage you to throw off the shackles of the past. Starting 
today, tell yourself, “I can and will succeed in math.”
Reexamine Your Past Math History
I’ve been able to identify several different reasons for the onset of 
math anxiety in the students with whom I’ve worked. Let’s explore 
some of these reasons and see how they might have affected you.
Embarrassments
Have you ever been embarrassed about math? Did you feel shy or 
mortified when being asked to do math in front of others in class? 
Many, many students report embarrassing moments related to 
math, dating as far back as first grade all the way through high 

The Math Anxiety Process   15
school. They quivered with self-consciousness when called upon to 
answer a math problem or do their times-table in front of the class. 
One wrong answer and they felt humiliated. Many feared being 
called to the chalkboard to work out a math problem, standing there 
all alone, with everyone watching. Public speaking fears and stage 
fright became associated with embarrassment over math. Other stu-
dents reported being drilled over and over with flashcards, and how 
flustered they became when they forgot even the easiest of facts or 
when they were caught counting on their fingers. Still other students 
were mercilessly teased by classmates if the answers came too easily 
and they seemed to enjoy math. They were called names like “nerd,” 
“show-off,” or “geek.”
Negative Life Experiences Associated  
with Learning Math
Many students have reported traumatic childhood experiences quite 
unrelated to math, but somehow the emotional upset of these experi-
ences became associated with math. Phyllis’s parents got divorced 
Another Cause of Math Anxiety

16    C H A P T E R   2
when she was learning long division, and to this day, Phyllis is dis-
traught whenever she is required to do math, especially division. 
Francisco’s family suffered a lot of emotional turmoil throughout his 
middle school and high school years. His father was an alcoholic, and 
family life was punctuated by many arguments. His home situation 
severely affected his ability to concentrate on math during those 
years, and math still remains an area of extreme discomfort to him. 
Norm’s grandmother died when he was in sixth grade. She had been 
living with his family, and her absence was taken very badly by ev-
eryone, especially Norm. He began to fall farther and farther behind 
in math and did poorly on his math tests. Soon Norm began dreading 
the thought of ever having to take a math class. He would do any-
thing to avoid math.
	
When you look back to the days when you first began to have 
math discomfort or fears, can you identify events in your life that 
were so emotionally disturbing they could have become associated 
with learning math? Or perhaps you experienced an illness or other 
interruption in your education that caused a critical gap in your 
math background. Many students also report a lack of family sup-
port when faced with math difficulties (Trujillo & Hadfield, 1999).

The Math Anxiety Process   17
Social Pressures and Expectations
Did family members or friends ever try to tutor you? Did they ever 
reprimand or show disgust when you didn’t seem to comprehend 
math quickly enough? Did your parents push you to succeed or 
compare you to a sibling who was a “math whiz”? Or perhaps you 
had relatives or classmates who discouraged your math achieve-
ment, telling you they were never good in math either. I’ve worked 
with students who had nightmares as a result of being tutored by 
demanding or overzealous relatives, and I’ve met others who vowed 
never to take math because they hated being compared to a sister or 
brother who excelled at math.
	
Margo’s father was an engineer who very much wanted Margo to 
be as competent in math as he was. Every night, he tutored her, went 
over her homework, and tested her on her progress. Margo wanted 
so much to please her father, but when she didn’t understand the 
math fast enough, he often got so frustrated he slammed the book 
down and walked away. By the time she got to high school, she began 
to avoid math. Unwilling to repeatedly face her father’s disappoint-
ment in her, Margo decided to take as little math as possible.
	
It has been well established that parents’ and teachers’ expecta-
tions influence children’s math achievement and their beliefs about 
their ability to learn math (Brannon, 2008; Eccles & Jacobs, 1986; 
Yee & Eccles, 1988). In addition, it’s been found social support is 
related to both the choice to take advanced math and the grades 
achieved in math. One study showed a strong relationship between 
the support students received from their parents, teachers, and peers 
and the choice to take advanced math courses in high school (Sells, 
1980). For example, girls supported in taking advanced math courses 
were more likely to earn As or Bs, but those without such support 
were likely to get Cs or Ds.
Desires to Be Perfect
Have you feared math because it seemed so exact to you that there 
always appeared to be a right and a wrong answer? And if you got a 
wrong answer, did you feel it was a poor reflection on you and your 
academic abilities? Many students feel like this. They often have a 
fragile, negative self-image. They don’t feel good about themselves, 

18    C H A P T E R   2
and they try to avoid situations that point out their weaknesses. 
Math puts them in such a situation. Each time in the past when they 
were called on in class and gave a wrong answer, it made them feel 
less worthy, dumb, or unintelligent. They would try and try to work 
math problems, but when their answers came out wrong, they were 
left with feelings of incompetence and poor self-esteem. Is it any 
wonder they began to avoid math? Has math affected you this way?
Poor Teaching Methods
In elementary or middle school, did you have teachers who really 
didn’t like math or want to teach it or who weren’t well trained to 
teach math? Did you have teachers who couldn’t answer your ques-
tions or perhaps would put you down when you didn’t know the an-
swer to a question? Did you find your teacher couldn’t quite explain 
the material in a way you could understand?
	
One student reported his fifth-grade teacher said if the class was 
good all day, they wouldn’t have to do their math that day. Math be-
came a punishment for the class if they misbehaved. It turned out 

The Math Anxiety Process   19
this teacher was trained as a drama teacher and was quite fright-
ened by math. In the past, many college students who were math 
anxious chose elementary school teaching to avoid most college math 
requirements. In doing so, they successfully sidestepped any con-
frontation with their anxiety, but they still harbored it. Since math is 
taught in all the elementary grades, these teachers had ample oppor-
tunity to pass their math fears and uncertainties onto their impres-
sionable students.
	
In other situations, teachers have ridiculed students or told them 
they would never be able to learn math. Teachers rushed through the 
material or gave few or no problems for homework to reinforce the 
concepts presented. In some cases, students needed to have hands-
on math experiences, and the teacher only lectured or wrote on the 
board but couldn’t provide adequate alternative teaching methods 
to accommodate kinesthetic/tactile learning styles. Other teachers 
weren’t trained in or did not implement effective teaching methods 
such as collaborative and cooperative learning groups to help stu-
dents learn math.
	
In one study, researchers set out to trace the roots of math anxi-
ety by conducting in-depth interviews with 50 elementary education 
majors in elementary-mathematics-methods classes (Trujillo & Had-
field, 1999). The results of this study were astonishing.  All the stu-
dents in the study had had several negative classroom math experi-
ences as well as a lack of parental support at home.  In addition, all 
students suffered from severe math anxiety and math test anxiety, 
and they were fearful about teaching mathematics themselves.  Yet, 
despite their own negative experiences with math, these students 
planned “to employ constructivist and developmental methods they 
learned in their college mathematics methods classes in order to 
make mathematics more meaningful to their own students” (p. 9). 
These future elementary school teachers were determined to provide 
a more positive math learning environment for their students than 
they had experienced. The authors concluded that negative class-
room math experiences, combined with lack of parent support and 
fear of math tests, were major contributors to math anxiety.
	
In another study, researchers examined the role of instructors’ 
behaviors in creating or exacerbating math anxiety in students from 
kindergarten through college. A total of 157 education majors in a 

20    C H A P T E R   2
senior-level elementary-mathematics class were asked to respond to 
the following statement:  “Describe your worst or most challenging 
mathematics classroom experience from kindergarten through col-
lege” (Jackson & Leffingwell, 1999).  
	
Surprisingly, only 11 of the 157 students reported having had 
only positive math experiences from kindergarten through college. 
Of the remaining 146 students, all underwent some traumatic math 
experience. Although some students were traumatized as early as 
kindergarten or first grade, the researchers found three main grade 
level clusters in which there were initial traumatic math encounters: 
(a) in the third or fourth grades, (b) ninth through eleventh grades, 
or (c) during their college freshman year.
	
The instructor behaviors most cited as disturbing to the students 
were scowling or having a demeaning manner; seeming angry, hos-
tile, uncaring, or insensitive; making derogatory comments; and 
having a gender bias. Also cited were teachers giving poor quality of 
instruction, poor explanations, or rushing through materials.
	
In addition to poor teaching methods, sometimes curriculum 
choices have adversely affected students.  These include unsatisfac-
tory textbook selection, inadequate prealgebra preparation courses, 
gaps in course or unit sequencing, too fast a pace, limited review or 
practice sessions, and materials or approaches incompatible with 
students’ learning styles.
Negative Math Games People Play
Do you ever say things to yourself that block your ability to do 
math? Your internal mind talk can play an important role in your 
math performance and could easily be a negative or destructive 
influence on you. When this talk is detrimental, we refer to it as 
negative math games. These games, if not reversed, can result in a 
complete loss of self-confidence in math, and self-confidence is one of 
the most important aspects of achieving math success. The follow-
ing statements are examples of self-defeatist games students play 
on themselves. You may say things like: “I was never good in math, 
so I can’t be good now.” “Why do I need math anyway?” “Math isn’t 
useful in my life.” “I don’t work math quickly enough.” “Everyone 
knows how to do it but me.” “This is a stupid question, but . . .” “It’s 

The Math Anxiety Process   21
too easy; I must have done it wrong.” “I got the right answer, but I 
don’t know what I’m doing.”
	
Aside from the negative math games you play on yourself, there 
are games others play on you. These are statements others say to you, 
deliberately or perhaps unintentionally, that negatively affect your 
ability to do math. Perhaps you sought help on a math problem and 
the other person responded: “Oh, that’s easy” or “You should know 
that by now.” “You’ll never be able to do math.” “You’ll just have to 
work harder in math, and you’ll get it.” “The answer’s right in front of 
you; don’t you see it [you dummy]?” Statements like these just serve to 
make you feel bad and to increase your fears and uncertainties about 
math. Other games people use include, “You got the right answer, but 
you did it the wrong way.” Since there are many ways to solve a math 
problem, this game serves to increase both your self-doubt and your 
anxiety level. Still others might try to discourage you from learning 
math by saying, “Why learn math anyway? You’ll never need it.”
Cultural Myths
Have you accepted the powerful myths surrounding math? Our soci-
ety too often accepts mathematics illiteracy. Few people would admit 
they can’t read. However, those who cannot do math will find lots of 
company, and acknowledging their deficiency not only produces no 
social stigma but generates empathy and commiseration. Further-
more, the popular media tend to portray those skilled in math as 
intellectually superior and, therefore, strange or different.
	
Throughout our society, parents, teachers, friends, relatives, 
books, magazines, and television have often perpetuated a system of 
false beliefs about math. It is a belief in these falsehoods, which have 
no basis in reality, that can stop you from making progress in math. 
Let’s look at some of these beliefs now.
	
Do you believe that you must have a “math mind” or be a men-
tal giant to succeed in math? Whereas there are people who have 
extraordinary aptitude and ability in math, as in any subject, you 
needn’t be a genius to become competent. You are able to do math. 
There is no special innate ability we inherit that relates only to this 
subject. We are all capable of learning math. It takes time, patience, 
determination, and a great deal of practice.

22    C H A P T E R   2
	
Are you convinced there is a magic key to doing math, or math 
problems must be worked on intensely until they are solved? Do you 
think there is a best way to solve each math problem? Once again, 
all these are falsehoods. There is no magic key or formula for doing 
math. There is no one best way to solve any problem. Usually, there 
are a variety of different ways to find the correct answer. And math 
problems often are not solved in one sitting. It is important to take 
breaks and rest during problem solving. Mathematicians may take 
several days, and sometimes months, to solve a difficult problem.
	
Have you often thought you should be able to do math quickly 
in your head and only dunces count on their fingers? Any physical 
model that helps you solve math problems is okay. For example, 
finger counting may actually show you understand what you’re do-
ing and you aren’t merely doing math through memorization. As for 
doing a math problem in your head, this is too much to expect from 
anyone who hasn’t done this sort of thing many times before. Even 
experienced mathematicians can’t necessarily work out new math 
problems in their heads.
	
Have you thought math is not creative or math requires only 
logic and rational thinking but not intuition? Perhaps you’ve be-
lieved you must always know how you got your answer or that it 
was always important to get the right answer in math. None of these 
statements represents reality; all are math myths. Math can be 
very creative, imaginative, and intuitive. Mathematicians often use 
their intuition to figure out solutions, and they can’t always explain 
how they arrived at their answers. Problem solving can be a very 
creative, innovative process. To play with various methods, test out 
what feels right, sleep on the problem, or brainstorm different solu-
tions can all be fun and inventive. Knowing the precise answers of-
ten doesn’t matter because many times answers to difficult problems 
may only be approximations or “guesstimates.”
Here, where we reach the sphere of mathematics, we are among processes 
which seem to some the most inhuman of all human activities and the 
most remote from poetry. Yet it is here that the artist has the fullest scope 
of his imagination. —Havelock Ellis, The Dance of Life (1923)

The Math Anxiety Process   23
Gender Stereotyping and Socialization
Do you believe that only males are good in math or that careers re-
quiring math, such as engineering, technology, or science, are mainly 
for men? The math-anxious males with whom I’ve worked would 
certainly disagree. They feel men aren’t any better in math than 
women.
	
Studies show gender-related differences in math performance 
are not present in the general population despite the stereotype that 
females dislike math and do poorly in it. This stereotype is quite 
destructive and often leads to biased treatment toward females from 
teachers, parents, and peers (Brannon, 2008).
	
Throughout elementary school, girls perform similarly to boys or 
demonstrate higher proficiency in arithmetic computational skills 
(Fennema, 1980; Hyde, Fennema, & Lamon, 1990). Things start to 
change for girls around age 12. Studies show they begin to feel less 
confident than boys about their math ability, and this trend, along 
with believing math isn’t important to them, increases into adult-
hood (Eccles, 1989; Kimball, 1995). Math becomes seen as a male 
domain (Kimball, 1995). It isn’t surprising, then, that we find high 
school girls often choose to take fewer math electives than boys, and 
their performance on standardized math tests is lower than boys’. 
Taking fewer high school math courses has long-lasting negative 
consequences for females. Math acts as a “critical filter,” barring 
those who are deficient from science, engineering, computer, and 
technology careers (Hyde, Fennema, & Lamon, 1990; Sells, 1980).
	
Cross-cultural research hasn’t substantiated a universal pattern 
of males outperforming females on standardized math tests. In some 
countries, female students’ achievement on math tests is equal to or 
superior to males’. This highlights the fact that American females’ 
poor representation in fields requiring math is most likely a cultural 
phenomenon (Feingold, 1988, 1994; Hanna, 1989; Huang, 1993; 
Lummis & Stevenson, 1990; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1994).
	
In another interesting study, researchers evaluated 220 female 
students’ math performance after they were given a bogus scientific 
explanation for alleged gender differences in math performance. The 
students were told one of four possible explanations: (a) There is a 
genetic (or inborn) reason for women underperforming in math. (b) 
There’s an experiential reason for women underperforming, such as 

24    C H A P T E R   2
boys receiving preferential treatment. (c) There’s a common cultural 
stereotype that females underachieve in math. (d) There are no sex 
differences in math. The researchers found that females given the 
genetic explanation for women’s underachievement had the worst 
math performance. Comparable low performance was also found in 
those reminded of the common cultural stereotype. The good news 
is that those students who received the experiential explanation or 
were told there was no difference both performed much better (Dar-
Nimrod & Heine, 2006).
	
In one study of female college students, researchers found that 
although women may explicitly disavow stereotypes and report egali-
tarian values, they could still be influenced by negative stereotypes on 
the preconscious or “implicit” level. In other words, even if they con-
sciously think that women can perform just as well as men in math, 
on a preconscious level they may still associate math achievement 
with males and not with females. The researchers noted, “The less 
women were gender identified and the less they possessed implicit 
gender stereotypes about math ability, the better they performed on 
the final exam and the more likely they were to express interest in a 
math-related career” (Kiefer & Sekaquaptewa, 2007, p. 16). 
	
In a monumental study, psychology Professor Janet Hyde and 
her colleagues looked at 7 million math scores from ten state stan-
dardized exams to determine whether gender differences exist (Hyde 
et al., 2008). They found that average math scores were the same for 
both genders. Even at the top scoring percentiles, there was little 
­difference. 
 	
Science Daily, an online research news journal, notes that “con-
tributing to the public’s notion that boys truly are better at math” 
is the fact that males often score better on the SATs than females 
do (2008, p. 2). With regard to the SATs, Hyde and her colleagues 
explain that many more females than males now take the SATs be-
cause a greater proportion of females than males attend college. As 
a result, the male scores represent more of the top talent among the 
male student population, while the female SAT scores represent both 
the top and lower tiers of female talent.
	
So it is sad but true that with all these studies indicating that 
females are capable of performing at equal levels to males in math, 
negative stereotypes about female’s math performance continue to 
exist.

Dyscalculia: A Cause or a Symptom?
For a small percentage of students, dyscalculia may be the cause of 
math anxiety. Yet, for others, math anxiety may manifest itself as 
dyscalculia or symptoms of innumeracy (Ashcraft, 1995).
	
According to the National Center for Learning Disabilities, “dy-
scalculia is a term referring to a wide range of life-long learning 
disabilities involving math” (NCLD, 2006). Studies have indicated 
that approximately 4% of students experience dyscalculia (Sharma, 
2003). 
	
Dyscalculia usually first shows up in elementary school, when 
a child has difficulty solving basic arithmetic problems and shows 
a poor understanding of number concepts and the number system. 
The student often is unable to recognize patterns when adding, sub-
tracting, multiplying, or dividing and does not understand what ar-
ithmetical operation is needed for a problem. Other difficulties have 
also been noted, such as when the individual is “counting, giving and 
receiving change, tipping, learning abstract concepts of time and di-
rection, telling and keeping track of time, and the sequence of past 
and future events” (Vaidya, 2004).
	
The causes of dyscalculia are not clear, but research points to a 
myriad of possible causes. These include heredity; a biological mala-
dy within the brain; emotional problems due to environmental depri-
vation; low intelligence; math anxiety; ineffective teaching strategies 
used during early childhood; or poor social skills (Michaelson, 2007).
	
If you have been diagnosed with dyscalculia, check out the follow-
ing Web sites for information: www.dyscalculia.org, www.ldanatl.org, 
and www.ldonline.org.
	
The anxiety reduction exercises described in Chapter 3 and the 
exercises on building positive self-confidence in Chapter 5 will help. 
In addition, see the section entitled, “Helpful Strategies for Dealing 
with Dyscalculia,” in Chapter 8.
What Is Your Math History?
So, as you can see, the origins of math anxiety are varied. The follow-
ing exercise will help you focus on your math history and will help 
you identify the early roots of your problem.

What is your math history? In the spaces that follow, briefly describe your 
chronological history in terms of the negative and positive experiences 
you’ve had with math. Include your earliest memories, as well as memories 
of how your teachers and your family influenced you in math. Describe how 
your family members approached math and describe their attitude toward 
your math ability. Include a description of how you’ve dealt with recent 
situations involving math in other classes, on the job, or in daily life situa-
tions. End with a discussion of how math could help you to accomplish your 
educational objectives, earn more money, choose a career, or in any other 
aspect of your life. (Use additional paper.)
Here are excerpts of math autobiographies written by students who are 
working on overcoming their math anxiety. Perhaps you can identify with 
one of them.
Theria, a junior, who hopes to become a Web page designer, wrote:

The Math Anxiety Process   27
I remember being very good in second-grade math, but I was never praised 
by my teacher or my parents. In third grade I noticed the boys in my class 
were always selected for math contests and games. I thought they must be 
really good at math and it wasn’t important for me to excel. By sixth grade, 
my grades in math declined. My father tried to tutor me, but he yelled and 
didn’t have the patience or the knowledge to help me through my math de-
ficiencies. My mother justified my failures by telling me she was never good 
in math either. “It’s no big deal; I turned out fine, didn’t I?” So now I had a 
justification not to try. My father frightened me and my mom let me know 
that failing math was okay.
Ricardo, a tall, lanky boy, who hopes to become an astronomer one day, 
wrote:
At a young age I found math fun and challenging. It came very easily to me 
(aside from the fact that I didn’t know my times-tables and to this day I 
still count on my fingers). Throughout the early years in school, I received As 
in math. I even did all right in prealgebra, ending the year with a B. But 
when it came to algebra, things started to get more difficult. In my other 
high school classes, I was able to “float” through the homework, many times 
doing the assignments right in class. But math was different. It took disci-
pline that I did not have. I didn’t do my algebra homework and my grade 
suffered as the result of it. I started getting Ds.
Jefferson, a member of the school basketball team, wrote:
From my earliest memories in elementary school, math was something to 
fear and despise. I was always the last to finish and the most likely to fail 
an exam. As a result of my poor performance and not wanting to be left 
behind, I became a professional cheater. This habit of mine continued until 
I reached high school, where I was put into prealgebra. I found myself way 
over my head in a class with students far more advanced than I. Every 
homework problem I did was wrong and every exam was a failure. Cheat-
ing didn’t help. My instructors in high school tried to help, but due to the 
large class sizes, they couldn’t tutor me. Soon after this, I began to skip class 
and became very indifferent toward school.

Reassess Your Past
I want to reiterate here what I stated earlier: Your past negative 
math experiences need not continue to burden you. It is both 
your responsibility and within your power to take control of your 
math destiny. In the next exercise, I encourage you to review your 
math history so you can understand the roots of your fears. Then I 
will ask you some important, thought-provoking questions to help 
you reevaluate your previous experiences. You can throw off the 
shackles of the past that have weighed you down so you can make 
progress.
E X E R C I S E  2 - 2  	Collaborative Learning: New Insights  
and Revelations
When you finish your math autobiography in Exercise 2-1, look it over and 
see if you can find the roots of your math anxiety. Is it clear where it began? 
What factors most influenced you? What past attitudes and actions on your 
part contributed to your current difficulties? Then ask yourself: “Are these 
conditions still relevant in my life today? Are the messages I carry around 
about my abilities to do math true today? Can I move further and not let 
the problems of the past be my perpetual stumbling blocks to learning 
math? What positive experiences can I build on?” In the space provided, 
describe the insights you have gained from reading over and analyzing your 
math history. Share your insights with a small group of classmates.

Picture the Math Anxiety Process
As you can see, unpleasant encounters with math in formative years 
can be ruinous to subsequent learning. Students who were made to 
feel bad about math become wary and prejudiced against it. They 
mistrust their own abilities. New experiences in math, seen in light 
of the old, are tarnished by their troubled past, which only accentu-
ates and reinforces long-entrenched negativity. Bad feelings persist. 
This impairs prospects for learning new material and generates 
anxiety and self-doubt. They say negative things to themselves, such 
as “I’m stupid,” “I’ll never be able to do math,” “I’ll fail,” and “Why do 
I need to know math anyway?” Soon a continuous flood of negative 
talk about math ensues; before long, anxiety, overwhelming fears of 
failing or looking stupid, and panic set in. Physically, these people 
may experience nausea, perspire profusely, develop a headache or 
tight muscles, or exhibit a number of other physical symptoms. Men-
tally, they become confused or disorganized, make lots of careless 
errors, forget formulas they knew, can’t think clearly, or blank out 
entirely. The end result: poor math performance, avoidance of math, 
“choking under pressure,” and failure. All these negative results lead 
back to more negative thinking, and the cycle continues. I have dia-
gramed this process in Figure 2-1.
	
When you deal with math anxiety, you must pay scrupulous at-
tention to what you really think and feel. Negative self-talk seems to 
be an especially critical habit, which keeps perpetually alive the neg-
ative experiences of your past and fosters an ever-increasing anxiety 
level. Let’s begin by looking at your negative dialogue straight on. In 
the following exercises, you are encouraged to keep a math journal. 
Writing a journal is an effective means of becoming aware of all your 
inner mind chatter surrounding math. I encourage you to heighten 
your awareness of what you say to yourself when you do math. What 
are the situations and subsequent self-­statements that trigger your 
­anxiety?

E X E R C I S E  2 - 3  	Math Journal Writing
Starting today, keep a journal about your everyday experiences using math. 
Use a format similar to the chart entitled “My Math Journal,” or write in 
an essay format. Include in your journal the responses to all the questions 
I have posed. Keep this journal for one or two months. Make at least two 
entries per week.
	
Column one of the journal asks, “What situation required me to use 
math today?” Even if you are not taking a math course currently, there are 
many daily life situations in which math is needed. Focus on these for your 
journal writing.
	
Next, respond to the statement in column two, “What I said to myself 
and how I felt during and after the situation.” Listen carefully to your in-
ner voice and note all your mind talk. Did you say negative statements to 
yourself about math or about your ability to do math? Then take a look at 
your feelings. Did you notice any physical symptoms such as sweaty palms 
or tense muscles in your neck or shoulders? Did you feel dumb or stupid, or 
confident and assured? Did you blank out, feel panicky, overwhelmed? Re-
cord all feelings and sensations.
	
Column three asks you to review “What I’ve learned about myself.” 
Objectively look at what you learned from this current math lesson. Did 
you learn you are too hard on yourself, that you are saying pretty nasty 
things to yourself about math and your ability to do math? Does one par-
ticular thought tend to repeat itself and make you feel defeated? Did you 
notice you feel unsure even when you can do math problems correctly? Do 
you give up too readily as soon as the problem becomes a little difficult? Do 
you know how to do the math, but does the anxiety make you uncomfort-
able? Write down everything you learn from observing your current math 
experiences.
	
The last column asks you to assert “What I’m going to do about it.” 
Now is the time to make a commitment and take some positive actions. Ask 
yourself: “What can I do to feel better about math? How can I increase my 
chances of success?” Describe all the steps you are willing to take.
	
As you continue to keep this journal in the next few months, and prog-
ress through this book, more ideas will come to you regarding the most 
relevant steps you need to take. Jot them down; capture all your ideas on 
paper.

Summary
In this section of our road map, we have investigated the roots of 
math anxiety and searched into your math history to see where it all 
began. We have looked at poor teaching methods, embarrassments, 
negative life experiences, social pressures and expectations, desires 
to be perfect, negative math games, math myths, gender stereotyp-
ing, and dyscalculia. We also diagramed the math anxiety process 
and saw how negative inner dialogue perpetuates it. You were en-
couraged to begin a math journal of your current math experiences 
to gain important insights into how your thoughts and feelings affect 
your math success. Throughout the chapter, my strong message to 
you has been: Your past negative math experiences need not contin-
ue to burden you. So I urge you to throw off the shackles of the past 
and, starting today, say to yourself, every day, several times each 
day, “I can and will succeed in math.”

Imagine, for a moment, a virtuoso concert violinist tuning her mas-
terly crafted violin. When the strings are too loose, the violin cannot 
be played. The violin sounds flat, sour, lifeless. The tension is too 
weak, and no matter how well trained the violinist, the violin cannot 
play beautiful, harmonious music. On the other hand, if the strings 
are strung too tightly, the resulting sound is a screeching noise, grat-
ing and uncomfortable to the ear, and far from pleasing. Just the 
right amount of tension is needed for the violin to sound its best. 
And at times during a performance, the violin has to be adjusted and 
readjusted to maintain this delicate balance. Only through special 
attention and sensitivity to the fine-tuning of the violin can the vio-
linist be assured of continuous success. The same is true in learning 
to manage anxiety.
	
We must learn how to finely tune our anxiety level, for anxiety 
can be our enemy or our friend. With too little anxiety, we feel lazy 
and unmotivated. We don’t push ourselves to perform or achieve. 
Our memory seems somewhat dull. We don’t think as clearly as we 
could. On the other hand, when we experience too much anxiety, we 
feel out of control and devastated. We become tense, out of balance, 
panicky. Our thinking appears confused and disorganized. We feel 
insecure, inadequate. Our minds often go blank, and we might expe-
rience physical symptoms of muscle tightness, diarrhea, shortness of 
breath, or vomiting. Images of doom and disaster loom over us.
	
However, as with the finely tuned violin, when we manifest just 
the right amount of tension, neither too little nor too much, we think

and Improve  
Working Memory

36    C H A P T E R   3 
clearly: Our memory is sharp, our perceptions are accurate, our judg-
ments are good. Maintaining the proper amount of anxiety helps us 
perform at our best. Thus, the goal of anxiety management is not to 
alleviate all the anxiety you may experience but to help you learn 
how to manage and finely tune the anxiety you have.
	
In this portion of our road map, we examine how anxiety affects 
your memory, and we explore ways to manage anxiety so you can 
function at your optimal level. 
Anxiety Can Affect Your Long-Term  
and Working Memory Systems
Two memory systems, your long-term memory (LTM) and your work-
ing memory (WM), play a crucial role in math learning, mastery, 
and problem solving. Anxiety can negatively influence both these 
systems and handicap your ability to solve even the simplest of math 
problems. 
	
Your LTM has a huge, nearly limitless capacity to store informa-
tion for long time periods. Its storage bank holds within it all the 
mathematical facts, principles, formulas, equations, and calculating 
procedures you have learned while studying math. You can think 
of the LTM as being analogous to a hard drive on a computer. Your 
hard drive stores all the information you decide to save so it will be 
available when you want to access it later. 
	
Students with the best long-term memories figure out ways to re-
late, categorize, and organize newly learned material with informa-
tion already in their memory bank so they can retrieve and update 
the information when necessary. Having ready access to your LTM 
storage bank and being able to retrieve information easily are essen-
tial for success in school. 
	
The LTM system is marvelous, but anxiety can have a devastat-
ing effect on it. When students get too anxious, access to the LTM 
storage bank becomes difficult, if not impossible. It is as if the doors 
to the memory bank get stuck closed. Then even the most basic for-
mulas or facts aren’t available when needed. It’s like having your 

Learn to Manage Anxiety and Improve Working Memory   37
computer freeze up. Your computer hard drive still has all the infor-
mation stored on it, but you can’t get to it until you figure out how 
to unfreeze your computer. Reducing your anxiety through regular 
practice of anxiety reduction exercises, such as those discussed in 
this chapter, will allow the doors of your LTM storage bank to re-
main open so you can retrieve the needed information. 
	
The second important memory system needed when doing math 
is your working memory (WM). Your WM is like your own personal 
processing plant. It is responsible for integrating new information 
with old memories and processing this newly integrated information 
for current use in problem solving, reasoning, comprehension, and 
decision making. 
	
WM allows you to hold information in an active state, long 
enough so you can utilize the information or process it for long-term 
storage. WM’s storage capacity is limited and only temporary. Cog-
nitive psychologists now believe that individuals can concurrently 
hold four separate items in their WM or as much as seven items if 
mnemonic strategies (memory aids) are used (Cowan, 2008; Saults & 
Cowan, 2007). 
	
Using a computer analogy, you can think of your WM as the RAM 
in your computer, where you input and work with new information, 

38    C H A P T E R   3 
process it, and then save it onto your hard drive or update existing 
files already on your hard drive. 
	
When working out a math problem, your WM is very busy (see 
Figure 3-1). It takes in and temporarily stores the new data and 
instructions for doing the necessary mathematical operations in the 
current problem, while it is simultaneously retrieving information 
from LTM, interpreting whether the information is appropriate and 
relevant for the task, performing the necessary mathematical opera-
tions, and retaining results gathered from each procedural step. WM 
helps you initiate, direct, and keep track of the sequence of steps or 
procedures you must take. All the while, your WM must help you 
stay focused and not be distracted by irrelevant thoughts or events 
in your surroundings.
	
As you can see, your WM plays a very significant role when you 
solve a math problem. For WM to function at its best, it needs your 
conscious effort and your complete, undivided attention. If you are 
highly anxious or distracted with fears, worries, or negative think-

ing, your WM capacity will be compromised, and it will be unable 
to function properly or process the current task. Since your WM is 
primarily able to hold only four items at a time, if one of those items 
is taken up with worrying, you would be now working with only 
three items, or at only 75% capacity. If additional negative self-talk 
is distracting you, you are now down to two available items, or 50% 
capacity and so on. Your math learning and problem solving will 
eventually come to a standstill or barely creep along. 
	
Mark Ashcraft and Elizabeth Kirk (2001) found that individu-
als experiencing high levels of math anxiety temporarily did not 
have available to them the full capacity of their WM while solving 
math problems. This decreased capacity resulted in large increases 
in reaction time and errors, as well as lowered math performance, 
when compared with individuals not experiencing this anxiety. The 
authors suggest that anxiety and intrusive worrying can occupy a 
significant portion of the WM, preventing it from focusing attention 
and working on a task. They concluded that “math anxiety disrupts 
the on-going, task relevant activities of working memory, slowing 
down performance and degrading accuracy” (p. 236). 
	
Researchers have also found that anxiety is debilitating to stu-
dents who are most qualified to succeed in math. Beilock and Carr 
(2005) found that students with the highest working memory capac-
ity and greatest math ability were the ones who were more vulner-
able to pressure to perform well. Those students who should have 
performed best were the ones most apt to “choke under pressure.” 
Their stress and anxiety consumed and overwhelmed their working 
memory capacity. 
	
Ashcraft and Krause (2007) also confirm that anxiety severely 
compromises and drains an individual’s WM potential. The authors 
state that “math anxiety seems to influence cognitive processing in a 
straightforward way—working memory resources are compromised 
whenever the anxiety is aroused” (p. 247).
	
This chapter contains exercises to alleviate your anxiety. Regu-
larly practice them, as well as Exercise 5-3 (Challenge Negative 
Self-Talk) and Exercise 9-8 (Thought-Stoppage Technique), to get a 
handle on your anxiety and intrusive thoughts and allow you to have 
full access to your WM capacity.

Fine-Tune Your Anxiety Level
Let’s look at what happens when you experience an anxiety reaction. 
When you begin to feel anxious, many physical changes occur. Your 
body reacts as if it was in danger and prepares for possible fight or 
flight. For example, the muscles of your arms and legs often tense, 
anticipating the need for action; the pupils of your eyes dilate, letting 
in more light to sharpen your eyesight; your heart rate increases to 
circulate blood more rapidly to the brain and vital organs; and res-
piration increases to provide more oxygen to the tissues. Physiologi-
cally, hormones are produced that activate the sympathetic portion 
of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. All of these sympa-
thetic reactions would be perfectly suited for survival when dealing 
with real-life emergencies.
	
Working out a math problem is obviously not a life-threatening 
event, but you may be approaching it as if it was. You may begin fo-
cusing more and more on fearful, negative self-talk and on the sym-
pathetic bodily sensations. This only serves to increase the anxiety 
and tension in your body. In a later chapter, we will deal with ways 
to change the negative self-talk and negative attitudes toward math 
that feed into this anxiety process and continuously threaten to 
make it overpowering.
	
As your anxiety reaction intensifies, the changes in the rate and 
pattern of breathing tend to be more pronounced. Instead of breath-
ing from the lower lungs, you begin to breathe much more rapidly 
and shallowly from the upper lungs. You may not even be aware of 
this more accelerated breathing. As you breathe more quickly, you 
expel carbon dioxide too rapidly. This produces hyperventilation, a 
condition resulting in the uncomfortable bodily sensations math-
anxious students experience. Some symptoms include confusion, 
inability to concentrate, shaking, fatigue, muscle spasms or pain, 
difficulty swallowing, tightness in the throat, choking sensations, 
shortness of breath, dizziness, irregular heart rate, numbness or tin-
gling of the extremities, and lightheadedness.
	
As you become more and more aware of these symptoms, they 
seem to increase. This process, if not stopped in its tracks, can lead 
to a total panic reaction in which you may completely avoid learn-
ing or doing math, freeze up, or actually get sick when approaching 

Learn to Manage Anxiety and Improve Working Memory   41
math. The following is the most important principle you need to 
know for managing anxiety:
By changing the rate and pattern of your breathing 
(during anxiety-producing situations) to a deep, slow 
breathing pattern utilizing your lower lungs, you can 
bring a sense of calm and ease to your body and mind.
	
Exercises 3-1 and 3-2 will teach you how to calm yourself physi-
ologically and prevent panic from setting in. Instead of automatically 
breathing rapidly and shallowly with your upper lungs, you learn 
to breathe gently, slowly, and fully from your lower lungs. These 
breathing exercises will produce the following calming effects:
	
decreased heart rate
	
decreased oxygen consumption
	
decreased muscle tension
	
decreased blood pressure
	
slowed breathing
	
increased sense of calm and peace in the mind
	
increased sense of relaxation in the body
E X E R C I S E  3 - 1  	The Calming Breath
This exercise asks you to breathe slowly and regularly, and with 
­every exhalation, to say the word “relax.”
Steps
	1.	 With your eyes closed, sitting in a comfortable position, slowly and 
gently inhale, concentrating on filling the lower part of your lungs and 
expanding your abdomen.
	2.	 Now, very slowly and easily, exhale . . . saying “relax” as you do so.
	3.	 Continue breathing gently and slowly, filling the lower lungs and then 
very slowly exhaling, saying “relax,” and feeling more and more re-
laxed with every breath you take. Continue for approximately 10 more 
­minutes.
I recommend you practice this exercise once or twice each day for 5, 10, or 
20 minutes each time. You can listen to this exercise on track two of the CD 
accompanying this workbook.

42    C H A P T E R   3 
E X E R C I S E  3 - 2  	Deep Abdominal Breathing Technique
This exercise asks you to fill your lower, middle, and upper lungs, 
while you slowly count to four. Then you are asked to hold your 
breath to the count of two, exhale slowly to the count of four, and rest 
to the count of two.
	
This is an extremely powerful technique during times of panic 
or anxiety. It should be used for no longer than 5 minutes at a time. 
However, if you wish to continue longer, you should switch to the 
Calming Breath technique described in Exercise 3-1.
Steps
	 1.	 With this method, it is important to breathe from deep within your 
abdomen. You may wish to put your hand on your abdomen to feel if 
you are truly breathing at this deep level. Have your eyes closed and 
sit in a comfortable position. Now, while slowly counting to four, take a 
long, deep breath, first filling your lower lungs, feeling your abdomen 
expand, then filling your middle and your upper lungs. Now hold this 
breath for the count of two.
	 2. 	Now slowly exhale to the count of four while relaxing the muscles of 
your face, jaws, neck, back, and stomach. And now rest for the count of 
two.
	 3.	 Now begin again. Inhale slowly to the count of four. Hold to the count 
of two. Exhale to the count of four. Rest for the count of two. Continue 
this exercise for a total of 5 minutes.
Variation 1: The Extended Exhalation
One variation of the Deep Abdominal Breathing technique is to take a slow, 
deep breath as you count to five, feeling your abdomen rise. Then, very 
slowly, exhale completely as you count to eight. Continue this breathing 
pattern for approximately 5 to 6 minutes. If you wish to practice longer, at 
this point, you may go back to the Calming Breath technique described in 
Exercise 3-1. You can listen to this variation of Deep Abdominal Breathing 
on track three of the CD accompanying this workbook.
Variation 2: The Gentle Rhythm of Your Breathing
In this technique, you observe the rhythm of your breathing. Allow your con-
sciousness to become totally aware of your breathing. Notice the temperature 
of the air, how it is cool when it enters and warm when you exhale. Observe 
how the air flows into your lungs and then how your abdomen rises and falls 
with every breath in and out. Continue to focus on this gentle rhythm. Allow 

Learn to Manage Anxiety and Improve Working Memory   43
it to quiet your thoughts and bring you a sense of calm, peace, and joy. Prac-
tice this for about 10 to 15 minutes each day. This is a wonderful technique to 
relax when you feel yourself tensing up while doing math.
Variation 3: The Extended Sigh Technique
Practice this exercise in a quiet, private place. You may do it standing, sit-
ting, or lying down. Begin by taking a deep, comfortable breath, filling your 
lungs completely. Then, while exhaling slowly, allow yourself to let out a 
deep, resounding sigh. Let the sigh extend as long as you can. Enjoy the 
intense feeling of relief this produces. Practice this deep, extended sigh 10 
to 12 times each time you do it. Use it whenever you are feeling a sense of 
frustration or high stress.
	
Be sure to practice at least one of the techniques described in 
Exercises 3-1 and 3-2 a few times a day, every day, for several weeks. 
These breathing techniques are particularly beneficial when used 
before entering a math situation in which you are very anxious. By 
practicing daily, you will become more comfortable and familiar with 
them so they can be immediately available to you during times of 
high academic stress.
	
Our hectic life styles often keep our stress levels so continuously 
activated that our minds and bodies stay aroused at extremely high 
levels for days, maybe weeks. Through practicing relaxation exercis-
es on a regular basis, you will be the master of your anxiety. You will 
be able to quiet your mind and body and restore homeostasis, your 
body’s internal equilibrium.
	
Studies show the systematic use of relaxation techniques on a 
daily basis for 10 to 20 minutes produces many significant benefits 
related to academic performance:
	
improved long-term and working memory
	
increased measured intelligence
	
improved perceptual awareness
	
relief from insomnia
	
decreased anxiety, irritability, and depression
	
increased emotional stability
	
improved self-esteem
	
greater capacity for reaching one’s potential
	
improved academic performance in both high school and college

44    C H A P T E R   3 
	
If you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety over math, you 
will need to create your own special approach. Do it now. If you get 
a handle on anxiety’s earliest signs, it won’t get the best of you and 
grow to panic-like proportions. There is no magical formula to pre-
vent anxiety or panic in math. It will take practice, determination, 
a positive belief in yourself, and a commitment to reach your math 
success goal.
Summary
Managing anxiety is like tuning the strings of a violin. When the 
tension is perfectly adjusted, the resulting music is sweet and me-
lodic. When you learn to fine-tune your anxiety level to allow just the 
right amount—not too much, not too little—you, too, will perform 
like a virtuoso.
	
In this section of our road map, we discussed the important roles 
that long-term and working memory have when we learn math and 
how high anxiety negatively affects these memory systems. We also 
probed the physiological changes you experience during an anxiety 
reaction. We explored methods for physically calming your mind 
and body. I encourage you to practice several different breathing 
techniques. When you are anxious, you must change from a shallow, 
rapid breathing pattern to a deep, slow breathing pattern using your 
lower lungs.

45
A psychology professor once said to me, “I’ve noticed that how my 
students deal with math is how they deal with life’s problems.” As I 
pondered what he said, I recognized the truth of his comment.
	
How do you handle problems when they emerge? Use Exercise 4-1 
to see how you deal with life’s obstacles. You’ll find it most valuable 
if you’re completely honest with yourself and if you practice it before 
reading further. Have someone read the exercise to you very slowly 
and calmly, or perhaps you can read it into a voice recorder and 
later play it back. (This exercise is an adaptation of a brief ­activity 
originally described by Susanne Culler in The Resource Manual for 
Counselors/Math Instructors, The Institute for the Study of ­Anxiety 
in Learning, Washington, D.C., 1980.)
E X E R C I S E  4 - 1  	The Wall Fantasy
Arrange to be in a quiet, dark room where you will not be disturbed for ap-
proximately 15 minutes. Sit or lie comfortably while you listen to the follow-
ing fantasy (each set of three dots indicates a few moments’ pause):
	
Begin by getting as comfortable as possible. Settle back, allow yourself 
to sink down inside, and gently close your eyes. It is important when you do 
fantasy work to be in a relaxed and meditative state.
	
Let’s begin by focusing on your breathing for a few moments. Take a 
deep and comfortable breath, filling your lungs completely . . . hold it a mo-
ment . . . and then . . . very, very slowly, let it out . . . slowly . . . feeling a 
wave of relaxation going from the top of your head all the way down to your 
toes . . . Good! Now take another deep and comfortable breath, filling your 
lungs completely . . . hold it a moment . . . and then . . . once again let it 
Overcome  
Internal Barriers

46    C H A P T E R   4
out very, very slowly, feeling another wave of relaxation going from the top 
of your head all the way down to your toes . . . slowly . . . feeling more and 
more relaxed as you do so.
	
Continue to breathe slowly, deeply, and regularly. (Pause for 30 sec-
onds.) Feel your body becoming more and more relaxed, feeling heavy and 
more and more relaxed. Allow all the tension to leave your body. (Pause for 
20 seconds.)
	
Now let’s begin our fantasy by imagining that you are walking along a 
road in the country. It is a beautiful day. The sun is shining warmly, but it 
is not too warm for comfort. The air is crisp and clear, and there is a gentle 
breeze that feels delightful as it glides past your cheek. The dirt beneath 
you feels warm and soothing to your feet. The fields on both sides of the 
road are lush, with vibrant, green, rolling hills. In the distance, you can see 
trees and wildflowers of every variety and color. Oh, it is a beautiful day!
	
The road you are walking on leads up and down gentle hills. Feel your-
self walking. Feel the gentle breeze blowing through your hair. Feel your 
arms swinging as you walk along.
	
The road makes a gradual curve and then, suddenly, your path is 
blocked by an enormous WALL. Walk up to the wall and feel its texture. As 
you look up, you see the wall stretching so high it seems to go into the clear 
blue sky above. To your right, the wall seems to stretch as far as the eye can 
see. And to your left, the wall stretches so far that it seems infinite. How do 
you feel? What do you do now? How do you proceed? (Pause for 2 minutes.)
	
Now slowly bring yourself back into this room. Bring with you the 
thoughts and feelings you had during this fantasy.
E X E R C I S E  4 - 2  	Analyze Your Fantasy
Having completed Exercise 4-1, these are some questions I’d like you to 
think about:
What did your wall look like?
What did you do when you got to the wall?
If you managed to get to the other side of the wall, how did you accomplish 
this feat?
What do you think is the purpose of doing this fantasy?
What is the most important thing you’ve learned about yourself that can 
help you to tackle obstacles you face, particularly with regard to math?

Overcome Internal Barriers   47
	
Examine how you deal with the wall in Exercise 4-1 and see how 
it resembles the way you treat problems in your life. This will give 
you some sense of how you are handling math. To overcome life’s ob-
stacles, we start with an awareness of what we are doing to stop our 
own progress. Then we must make a conscious decision to change 
and prevent these obstacles from standing in our path.
	
When you got to the wall, what did you do? Did you resolutely turn 
back? Did you cry, feel stymied, not knowing what to do, and so simply 
do nothing? Did you look for a hidden way through the wall and find a 
secret door? Did you find a big tree nearby and use it to climb over the 
wall? Perhaps you dug your way under the wall or started removing 
stones from the wall to dig your way through it. Did you blast your 
way through it with a bulldozer or a large vehicle?
	
If you turned back and didn’t go past the wall, perhaps there 
were times in life you have turned back from obstacles, not looking 
for ways to overcome them. Have you simply and calmly accepted 
each obstacle that arises in life, content that maybe this is not the 
way to go? If this is true for you, what does this mean for how you 
face the challenge of math? Perhaps you tend to give up too easily 
when math becomes a bit rigorous, confusing, or in any way anxiety 
provoking. Or perhaps you tell yourself math just isn’t for you and 
you should choose a major not requiring math. Or instead, you may 
have been generally complacent about the absence of math in your 
life, not taking any steps to change this situation.
	
One student, Diana, said when she came to the wall, she was so 
frustrated she sat down and cried. She realized she treated her math 
classes the same way. As soon as a math class got a little hard, she’d 
get depressed and feel bad about herself. She’d give up, wouldn’t try, 
and eventually drop the course. She had a long history of treating 
math like this. She knew now she needed to do something different 
to change this destructive pattern.
Getting Through the Wall
In working with the Wall Fantasy in my classes, I noticed students 
who are determined to get to the other side of the wall are more 
persistent in tackling and overcoming their math problems. Look at 
what strategy you chose for getting through the wall. Were you slow 

48    C H A P T E R   4
and methodical? Did you blast your way through? Did you find a hid-
den opening? Did you jump over it as if you were on springs? Looking 
at your approach to math, how have you or how can you now apply 
this method to tackle difficulties in math?
	
Rafael got through his wall by systematically taking out one brick 
at a time until he made a big enough opening for his body to slip 
through. He found this slow, methodical approach worked best for him 
in math, too. Every day, he worked on ten new math problems and 
five old ones. He went back to basics, reviewing old materials to make 
sure he had them down pat. Slowly, he chipped away at math as he 
had chipped away at the wall. His confidence began to build, and he 
knew he was establishing a good foundation for himself in math. Soon 
he was able to tackle any new material presented in class. 
	
Elena blasted through her wall the same way she handled prob-
lems in life—full steam ahead! But she never thought of tackling 
math like this until now. She decided math was not going to prevent 
her from becoming a civil engineer, a career she always wanted. 
She started reviewing every algebra book she could find. She took a 
minimum class load and focused mainly on math. She joined a study 
group, got herself a good tutor, attended a math study-skills work-
shop, and began studying algebra 2 to 3 hours a day. She practiced 
relaxation techniques and positive visualization techniques regularly 
so she could remain calm and positive about math.
	
Overcoming math anxiety starts with an awareness of what you 
may be doing now to stop yourself from succeeding. Are you creating 
your own internal barriers that impede your progress? Are you han-
dling problems as they appear in your path or do you avoid them? 
Once you realize what you do to hinder your own progress, you can 
make a conscious decision to take corrective action.
	
What if you gave up when you came to the wall, and you noticed 
you have a tendency to give up too easily in math? Ask yourself: Do 
you really want to overcome your problems with math anxiety? Are 
you willing to deal with your obstacles now? Once you are aware of 
how you stop yourself from succeeding, you can consciously decide to 
change this situation. I would suggest you begin by reexperiencing 
the Wall Fantasy (Exercise 4-1). Take yourself through this fantasy 
again, but this time do it differently. Try alternative ways of getting 
through or past the wall. Experiment until you find the most satis-

Overcome Internal Barriers   49
fying way to overcome this major obstacle. Remember, this is your 
wall; this is your barrier to your future success. You can do it! You 
can get through it, over it, under it, or even blast it down, leaving it 
in rubble.
	
You may also wish to experiment with other techniques to deal 
with your internal blocks in math. Journal writing, described in 
Chapter 2, is an excellent method. Exercise 4-3 is a variation on jour-
nal writing, and it can help you confront word problems, a nemesis 
for many. You could also talk with a counselor or math teacher who 
may be able to give you ideas on how to proceed.
E X E R C I S E  4 - 3  	Word Problem Log
Many people fear word problems. Faced with one, internal barriers go up, 
and walls seem to appear from nowhere. As you read the following word 
problems and begin to work them out, pay attention to how you feel, what 
you say to yourself, and how this inner dialogue inhibits your progress. 
Don’t worry if you’re not sure how to approach these problems; it’s not the 
solutions but how you feel about being asked to solve them that’s important. 
You may be quite surprised at what you learn about yourself.

in an all-night parking garage 
for three and a half days. The 
garage charges either an hourly 
rate of $1.25 or a daily rate of 
$24 for whole or partial days. Is 
she better off paying the hourly 
or the daily rate?

Answers to the sample word problems in Exercise 4-3:
	1.	 The daily rate is $24 times 4 days, totaling $96. This is better than the 
hourly rate of $1.25 times 84 hours, totaling $105.
	2.	 Eileen is 12 years old. 
Math Self-Concept and Math Self-Efficacy
Do you have confidence that you have the ability to learn math and 
do well in math? Your math self-concept is your self-perception of 
your own competence to learn and do math. Your math self-concept, 
whether positive or negative, is not necessarily related to your actual 
math ability. In other words, you may have the ability to learn and 
to do well in math, but your perception of yourself may be quite the 
opposite. As a result, if you have a poor math self-concept, you may 
not put as much effort into math, or you may have more negative 
self-talk and/or math anxiety when doing math.

Overcome Internal Barriers   51
	
Ashcraft and Kirk (2001) found that highly anxious individu-
als have negative self-perceptions of their math abilities. In their 
research, they found a negative correlation between students’ 
self-confidence in doing math and their math anxiety. That is, the  
less self-confident the students were, the more math anxiety they 
experienced.
	
I encourage you to examine your perception of your own math 
abilities. A poor math self-concept may be an important obstacle you 
must overcome. Exercise 4-4, Your Math Self-Concept, asks you to 
examine your perceptions of your ability to do math.

To find your grand total, add up the total points of all three columns:
MY GRAND TOTAL IS: ______________________________
If your score is 14 or higher, you have a generally positive math self-
concept.
If your score is 8 to 13, your math self-concept is a little weak and could use 
a boost.
If your score is below 8, you have a poor math self-concept, and you need 
help soon! The exercises described in Chapter 5, Positive Thinking Is a Plus 
Sign, will help you to improve your math self-concept.
	
Closely related to your math self-concept is how effective you feel 
you will be if you put effort into learning and doing math. For exam-
ple, when given a math problem, do you feel that if you try, you can 
successfully work it out and come to a correct conclusion? This feel-
ing of how effective you would be is called your math self-efficacy. 
	
Albert Bandura (1997) found that self-efficacy is dynamic, and it 
evolves and improves as an individual gains more and more experi-
ence with a task. So, potentially, the more effort you put forth as you 
learn math, the more effective you will feel. Your math self-efficacy 
will improve, and you will feel more capable of success.
	
Studies have shown that the higher a student’s math self-
­efficacy, the more likely he or she will be to take math courses and 
learn math. On the other hand, students with low math self-efficacy 
are more likely to give up easily or to avoid math. Students who feel 
that no matter how much they try, they will fail or do badly, will not 
even try. 
	
I urge you not to allow negative thoughts or a poor math self-
­concept to get in your way. Don’t let them put up barriers for you. 
Work to improve both your math self-concept and self-efficacy. Put 
effort into your math and know you can succeed. The more you 
work on your math, the better you will feel about it and the more 
successful you will be. To improve your math self-concept and math 
self-­efficacy, follow the suggestions offered in Chapter 5 on positive 
thinking and in Chapters 8 and 10 on effective math study skills 
and how to be a successful problem solver.

Summary
In this section of our road map, we examined how we tackle obstacles 
along our path. We looked at how we deal with life’s problems as an 
analogy for how we deal with math and what we can learn from this 
experience. We also explored the importance of math self-efficacy 
and our math self-concept.

Do You Have an Attitude Problem?
Once, when I was a guest speaker in a trigonometry class, a young 
man named Leonard unexpectedly volunteered a thoughtful and in-
spiring testimonial:
I used to do real badly in math throughout high school. 
I thought math was for the birds. I got so frustrated 
with it, I couldn’t stand it. I began hating it. I felt I just 
couldn’t do it, and I didn’t want to even try. I figured I 
was just a lost cause when it came to doing math. But 
all that has changed. One day, in a quiet moment, a 
voice inside me said, “Hey man, you’ve got an attitude 
problem.” The more I thought about it, the more I 
realized I was the only one who could change things 
around. So I made up my mind to look at math like it 
was doable and important. I saw an image of myself 
getting good math grades, getting through school, and 
having a good life. I saw myself using math to solve 
everyday problems and feeling good about using num-
bers. And darned if it didn’t work! When my attitude 
about math changed and got better, I started doing 
great. I like math now, and my work really shows it.
	
How do you feel about math? Are you intimidated by it? Do 
you fear it or hate it? Do you sometimes think it’s boring or you’re 
wasting your time? Do negative thoughts keep creeping into your 
­consciousness? What do you say when you’re having trouble figuring 
Positive Thinking  
Is a Plus Sign
C  H  A  P  T  E  R

Positive Thinking Is a Plus Sign   55
out a problem? Do you say things like: “I’ll never be able to do math” 
“I’m overwhelmed.” “Who needs math anyway?” “Why bother?” Do 
you feel no matter how hard you try, you’ll never be able to succeed? 
Have you ever thought that perhaps your negative attitude toward 
math diminished your ability to succeed in it?
	
Educators have known for centuries, for a student to achieve aca-
demic success, it takes more than innate ability, competence, or the 
desire to learn. The key element in this process is having a positive 
attitude. A positive attitude becomes the catalyst, the supercharger 
propelling you along the road toward your math goal.
	
A positive attitude in math is like grade A-1 grease in a well-
­lubricated engine. The grease enables the engine to run smoothly, 
with fewer breakdowns or jammed gears, and with less vibration. 
The engine hums along, working at top speed, doing its job and do-
ing it well. Poorer quality grease would gum up the works, make the 
engine stick, interfere with its performance, and perhaps totally clog 
it. Starting today, give yourself A-1 top-rated positive attitudes to 
lubricate your thinking! The time has come to change your negative 
attitudes to positive, growth-enhancing, reinforcing ones. Exercises 
5-1 through 5-11 will help you do this.
E X E R C I S E  5 - 1  	Positive Affirmations  
for Succeeding in Math
An affirmation is a powerful, positive proclamation of something you desire, 
stated in the present tense. It is a direct, short, simple, active declaration 
containing no negative words or meanings. It is stated in the “now” as if it is 
already occurring, even though it might not have happened yet. This is done 
to reflect an outcome that is desired in the present or as soon as ­possible.
	
Read, speak, or visualize positive math affirmations to yourself several 
times each day. This will help you reprogram and replace negative math 
self-talk. Some students even record their positive math affirmations in 
their own voice, with relaxing music in the background, and listen to the 
recording while commuting to school, running, or going to sleep. This has a 
very powerful effect!
	
Some people are bound to say, “This is all well and good, but how do you 
expect someone to be able to do something he or she really can’t do now?” 

56    C H A P T E R   5
The point is the skill or capacity to do math, especially if it seems difficult, 
will come to you much more easily if you begin to believe you’re developing 
it now. It’s like turning an ocean liner at sea—the ship won’t change direc-
tion until the helmsman turns the rudder. A positive affirmation is the turn-
ing force that sets you off in a new and rewarding direction.
	
Here is a list of positive affirmations to help you succeed in math. Check 
the ones you believe would be most helpful on your path to math success. 
Repeat these statements often to yourself. Remember to substitute these 
or similar positive affirmations every time negative thoughts about math 
enter your mind.

E X E R C I S E  5 - 2  	Poster Your Wall
Surround yourself with positive thoughts and affirmations. Choose your 
favorite affirmations from the list in Exercise 5-1 or create your own. Then, 
with brightly colored markers and letter-size colored paper, put each of 
these positive math statements on a separate sheet. Write them out in 
large letters and create a fancy border around each poster. Use decorative 
typefaces, “WordArt,” clip art, and borders to produce fanciful computer 
posters. Design them as artistically as you can. Have fun with them. Many 
of my students get a big kick out of this activity. Some of our community col-
lege students put flowers on them or smiling faces or fancy designs. Make 
at least three or four of these posters. Hang them in the place you usually

study. Attach them to your refrigerator, on your telephone, on your mirror, 
in your car, or anywhere that you can see them during the day. Make them 
visible; they are reminders of your growing positive attitude toward math. 
My students believe it would have been wonderful if these posters had 
been prominently displayed, long ago, on the walls in their elementary and 
middle school classes.
E X E R C I S E  5 - 3  	Challenge Negative Self-Talk (Optional)
Every time negative statements about your abilities or about math come to 
mind, take note of them, and then immediately change or challenge them. 
Ask yourself these questions:
	1.	 Does this self-talk hurt or help me with math?
	2.	 Does this self-talk affect how I feel about math and my ability to do 
math?
	3.	 Does it affect my desire or motivation to do math?
	4.	 Is my self-talk based on fact or fabrication?
	5.	 Does this statement distort reality? If so, what is the objective reality?
	6.	 Is this statement 100% true? Is there room for doubt?
	7.	 What evidence do I have to prove it is true?
	8.	 Even if it is true, does it make me, or math, bad?
	9.	 What is a more reasonable statement I can say to feel better about 
math?
Create Personal Metaphors
In their musical South Pacific, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote a 
delightful song whose lyrics, on the surface, make no sense: “I’m go-
ing to wash that man right out of my hair, and send him on his way.” 
Obviously, the composers did not intend these lyrics to be interpreted 
literally, yet we understand their meaning precisely. Moreover, the 
image created by the lyrics conjures up a complex set of emotions 
most of us have experienced—the notion of a cleansing ritual to get 
rid of bad feelings and make a positive change.
	
The composers used the classic literary device known as a meta-
phor. A metaphor is traditionally defined as a word or phrase that 

Positive Thinking Is a Plus Sign   59
­denotes one thing but implies or suggests another. Metaphors are 
valuable because they help us develop new insights and ways of 
looking at our human experience. Through their powerful imagery, 
metaphors inspire and lead us to greater and greater heights and 
exhilarating emotions. Rodgers and Hammerstein again, in their 
production The Sound of Music, used an uplifting metaphor in the 
lyrics, “Climb every mountain, ford every stream, follow every rain-
bow, till you find your dream.” It wouldn’t be humanly possible to 
follow these directions verbatim, yet the implied message—to accept 
challenges, to seek new experiences, to never give up, to live life 
fully, all in pursuit of our goals—appeals to us at a deeply personal 
level.
	
To the extent we act on this message, the metaphor has effec-
tively taught us and changed our ideas. Metaphors help us organize 
our thoughts and give us a direction for our actions. Not just compos-
ers and poets but philosophers and prophets alike have intuitively 
known and used the power of the metaphor. From Plato’s teachings 
to those of Jesus and Martin Luther King, the metaphor has been a 
tool to change attitudes and influence behavior. And it still works!
	
Exercise 5-4 will help you create your own metaphors to alter 
your negative attitudes and think more positively about math and 
your ability to do it. In this exercise, I ask you to develop a series 
of positive thoughts, images, and metaphors for guiding your math 
success.
	
First, I want you to list positive adjectives or nouns that come 
to mind when you think of succeeding in math and overcoming your 
math fears and anxieties. Some examples include conquest, win, suc-
cess, enjoyment, innovative, creative, informative, triumphant, vic-
tory, important, fun, worthwhile, useful, helpful.
	
Second, make a list of inspirational images to accentuate these 
ideas. Examples include guiding light, beacon, buoy, lighthouse, 
director of a play, completing a puzzle, reaching the finish line, sur-
vival, champion.
	
The third section of this exercise asks you to describe the growth-
enhancing emotions you would like to experience. Students who are 
overcoming math anxiety have listed confidence, relaxation, assured-
ness, excitement, happiness, thoughtfulness, calmness, courageous-
ness, inner strength.

60    C H A P T E R   5
	
You are now ready to write your own positive metaphors. Section 
four asks: What metaphors would inspire you and direct your actions 
on the road to success? What positive ideas, images, and emotions 
can you put together to create your own special metaphors? Here are 
some metaphors that have helped other students on their journeys:
	
Reaching for the stars
	
Knowing the ropes
	
Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
	
Weathering the storm
	
Gliding along in cruise control
	
Going full-steam ahead
	
Bulldozing my way through
	
Sailing through with flying colors
	
Water rolling off a duck’s back
	
An award-winning performance
	
Going for the gold
	
Hitting a home run
E X E R C I S E  5 - 4  	Create Personal, Positive Metaphors
	1.	 List at least ten positive adjectives or nouns you can associate with suc-
cess in math.
	2.	 List at least seven inspirational images you can relate to your conquest 
of math fears and success in math.
	3.	 Describe growth-enhancing emotions you would like to experience as a 
result of overcoming math anxiety.
	4.	 Now, using the positive ideas, imagery, and emotions you have identi-
fied, develop your own special positive metaphors.

Positive Thinking Is a Plus Sign   61
	5.	 Once you create your own personal metaphors, use them to inspire and 
guide you on your path to math success. Picture the images in your mind 
and carry around with you the positive feelings they produce.
	6.	 Write the metaphors on separate 3″ × 5″ cards and post them in the 
place you study.
Put Enthusiasm into Your Life
Enthusiasm can make anything we do 1,000 times better. It livens 
up our lives and our activities. It gives us the “oomph,” the energy, 
and the forward momentum to achieve anything on which we set our 
sights. When students become enthusiastic about a subject, their 
motivation increases. They see the subject as their ally and not as 
their enemy. Things they never noticed before become more mean-
ingful, and learning improves.
	
Here are seven steps to help you become more enthusiastic about 
math. Why not give them a try?
1.  Delve into Math More Deeply
To become more enthusiastic about anything, you need to increase 
your exposure to it; you need to explore it and view it from different 
angles. Start asking more questions, and let your curiosity fly. Search 
out different math books to further explain a topic you are learning 
about and to give you a deeper understanding of it. In addition to in-
creasing your enthusiasm, it is a great study-skills strategy.
	
Begin to pay attention to the usefulness of math in your everyday 
activities. Look on the Internet for math games and math puzzles. 
Seek out interesting math facts or curiosities. Look for patterns and 
relationships; use your imagination. See how math affects every as-
pect of our lives. Math is amazingly pervasive.
	
The word statistics may have an ominous ring to it, but an aston-
ishing number of average Americans immerse themselves with relish 
in the batting averages, rebound percentages, and pass-completion 
ratios of their favorite sports heroes. Probability theory may seem 
hopelessly esoteric to you; casino owners are counting on this reac-
tion as you part with your money. You may be consumed with the task 

62    C H A P T E R   5
of equitably dividing up a pizza at a party, yet be blissfully unaware 
the same theoretical methods apply to apportioning congressional 
­districts.
	
Like the infinite hexagonal variety of snowflakes, mathematical 
patterns in nature surround us with beauty and mystery. The spirals 
on the surface of a pinecone or pineapple, the arrangement of leaves 
around a plant stem, and the growth spirals of seeds in a sunflower 
or sections of a chambered nautilus shell all follow the same pat-
tern of elegant mathematical symmetry (known as the Fibonacci 
sequence). Artists in all cultures have duplicated these patterns in 
their work for thousands of years.
	
Fractal geometry describes the shapes of natural objects and 
boundaries, and modern computer graphics have translated this 
complex theory into hauntingly beautiful images of imaginary moun-
tains, coastlines, and fantastic shapes.
	
We are everywhere surrounded and awed by the power of math-
ematical consistency in an ordered universe. From estimating elec-
tion results to predicting earthquakes, from designing interconnected 
telephone systems to analyzing the interconnectedness of the human 
nervous system, math is, at the core, the one indispensable tool.
	
Take time to answer these questions for yourself: Why is math 
so important? What do you believe are the five most essential uses 
of math in our society? Can you describe at least five ways math is 
useful in your everyday life? What are three possible ways math can 
help you in your career choice? Chapter 11 will help you delve into 
the importance of math in your future.
2.  Every Time You Do Math, Liven It Up
Enthusiasm, or its conspicuous absence, affects everything you do. 
Adding it to your work with math will make you feel better. And even 
if at first you don’t feel like being enthusiastic—fake it! It’s strange 
how the mind works. If you start to act enthusiastic, motivated, full 
of positive drive to do your math, guess what? Your mind starts to 
believe it, and before you know it, you feel better. So go enthusiasti-
cally to math class. Really want to be in class learning the material. 
Listen and become intrigued, take lots of notes, and ask questions 
with interest and motivation. Do your homework with gusto. Put 

Positive Thinking Is a Plus Sign   63
vitality into your studying. Don’t grumble to yourself, “I have to take 
math.” Instead, tell yourself, “I choose to study math—it’s a great op-
portunity.” And say it with life! Remember, it’s okay to fake it at first 
because, pretty soon, it will all be true!
3.  Liven Up Your Attitudes about Yourself and Math
All great successful people know: You are what you think you are. Al-
bert Ellis, in his book Guide to Rational Living, tells us our thoughts 
affect our feelings, and they, in turn, affect our actions. So never un-
derestimate the power of thought.
	
It is your thought power that directs you in your pursuit of life. If 
you think you’re stupid, if you think you can’t do math, if you think 
you’ll never succeed in math—you’re right. You are what you think 
you are.
	
So, beginning today, think positive, enthusiastic thoughts about 
yourself and about math. Liven up your attitudes. Make them posi-
tive and encouraging. Let an optimistic, radiant glow gradually build 
inside you, a feeling based on the thought, “I can do it!”
4.  Give Yourself Pep Talks
You are what you think you are—thinking makes it so! So always 
think positively about yourself and your ability to do math. Never 
put yourself down or sell yourself short.
	
Your thoughts, whether positive or negative, grow stronger and 
more powerful when fueled with constant repetition. You must vac-
cinate yourself against thinking failure!
	
What is most important is not how intelligent you are, or what 
your IQ is, or how much brain power you have. What is really impor-
tant is how you use what you have. It is not brain power but think-
ing power that counts on your road to math success. The thoughts 
guiding your intellect are more important than how bright you are. 
So tell yourself every day, “My positive thoughts and attitudes are 
my keys to success.”
	
Carry a winning attitude around with you in school, in math 
class, when doing homework, when studying math. Practice positive 
pep talks at home, in the car, in bed, in front of the mirror. Discover 
all the reasons you can to figure out math problems and why it’s fun 

64    C H A P T E R   5
to solve them. Explore how you can be a winner in math. Use your 
brain power to help search out and create new and better ways to 
understand and succeed in math. Tell yourself at every opportunity: 
“I can do math. I’m a great student. I’m a winner!”
	
Design your own Math Winner’s ad campaign to use in your daily 
pep talks. This is a technique for selling math and you to yourself! 
It is like the copy (the words) in any advertising campaign or com-
mercial used to sell a new product. In the ad, math and you are the 
promising new product. I’d like you to buy into this wonderful prod-
uct and discover the joys of being a winner in math!
	
Carolyn, a sophomore who is overcoming math fears, wrote this 
pep talk:
“Now available—a breakthrough in math students—
new and improved! ME!!
	
“You’ll find more to like than ever before. Candidly, 
I’m bright, uncommonly talented, fabulously moti-
vated, and uncompromisingly determined—everything 
you’ve come to expect in a proven math success story. 
But hold on—there’s even more. As a further conve-
nience, I can learn math quickly and readily. Simply 
stated, I know my basic math facts. But that’s just part 
of the story—I’m starting to really understand alge-
braic equations. Sounds incredible? And that’s not all. I 
know my formulas and I can easily work out homework 
problems. As if this weren’t enough, my memory is 
awesome, especially when I stay calm and relaxed. But 
I don’t stop there. You’ll be glad to know I’m persistent 
in my desire to learn and comprehend math.
	
“The result? I Am a Math Winner! Absolutely! 
Certainly! Fantastic, I admit, but true. Seeing is be-
lieving! What’s more, satisfaction is assured. And I’ve 
saved the best news for last—I come with a lifetime 
guarantee to succeed in math.”
	
Exercise 5-5 shows you how to develop your own special math 
winner’s “promo.” Once you have fashioned it, say it to yourself every 
day, two or three times a day. It has an ironclad guarantee of success!

E X E R C I S E  5 - 5  	Collaborative Learning:  
The Math Winner’s Ad Campaign
	1.	 Think of something positive you can state about yourself in each of the 
following areas. Don’t be modest. Identify what you feel good about, 
what you do well in, what you feel proud of, what might “endorse” you to 
others.
	 	 My determination to succeed in math________________________________
	 	 My motivation to do well____________________________________________
	 	 My intelligence level_ ______________________________________________
	 	 My ability to understand and comprehend____________________________
	 	 My memory_ ______________________________________________________
	 	 The math skills I already have______________________________________
	 	 My “stick-to-it-tiveness”____________________________________________
	 	 My desire to learn__________________________________________________
	 	 My________________________________________________________________
	 	 My________________________________________________________________
	 	 My________________________________________________________________
	2.	 Now write the ad copy to be used in your campaign for selling yourself to 
you! Talk directly to yourself. Include the positive selling points you iden-
tified in part one of this exercise. Be direct. Focus only on the positives.
	3.	 Read your new ad aloud to a small group of classmates.
	4.	 Make at least two copies of this ad campaign. Post one in a place where 
you can see it often. Carry the other around with you so you can read it 
frequently.
	5.	 Practice saying your ad aloud, each day, in front of a mirror.
	6.	 Read your ad campaign silently several times every day and before ­going 
to bed.
	7.	 Read it before working on math or prior to attending math class. It will 
boost your spirits and your confidence.

Here is an ad copy written by Raghib, a sophomore at my school.
Raghib, you’re doing great. You’re a bright guy who works hard at every-
thing you do. You are motivated to succeed and I know you will. You are 
disciplined and persistent in your pursuit to learn math. Each day you’re 
comprehending more and more math. You are building a strong math 
foundation using the best math study skills. You have a good memory and 
fabulous “stick-to-it-tiveness.” If anyone is going for the GOLD in math, it is 
you. Raghib, I’m on your side. You are becoming a math winner!
5.  Use the Language of a Math Winner
Whenever you talk about math and your ability to do math, use 
positive, encouraging terms. Be optimistic in everything you say and 
do. If someone asks you how you like math and you say things like, 
“Math is my worst subject,” or “It’s a constant struggle,” or “Don’t 
ask,” you only make yourself feel even worse. So instead of respond-
ing negatively, say, “I’m starting to really like math,” or “I feel great 
about it,” or “My math ability is getting better each day.”
	
Every chance you have, say good things about math. Never put 
yourself or math down. When you begin to use the language of a 
math winner, you will be surprised at how rapidly you’ll feel better. 
Tell yourself and the world how great you feel about math, what a 
worthwhile subject it is, how useful you find math, how it’s helping 
you reach your career goal, and what fun it can be. By using the con-
fident, assured language of a winner, soon you will feel enthusiastic 
about math and about your potential to succeed in math.
E X E R C I S E  5 - 6  	Develop Your Personal Winning Language 
(Optional)
List five positive statements you could say about math if someone asks 
you, “How do you like math?” Be sure to use words, phrases, or metaphors 
that signal hope, promise, joy, cheerfulness, satisfaction, lightheartedness, 
­accomplishment, and victory.

	3.	 __________________________________________________________________
	4.	 __________________________________________________________________
	5.	 __________________________________________________________________
Use these statements whenever talking about math to others, and say them 
with enthusiasm!
Here are some ideas of winning language you can use:
	
I think math is great.
	
I’m liking math more each day.
	
Solving math problems gives me a great sense of 
­accomplishment.
	
I’m enjoying my math class.
	
Math is becoming one of the joys of my life.
	
I really love challenging my mind with math problems.
	
I’m winning at math and I love it.
6.  Deal with “Math Downers”:  
Don’t Let Negative Thinkers Pull You Down
Don, a sophomore, was surrounded by friends who discouraged him 
from taking any more than the minimum required math. When 
he decided to take an advanced math course, they began to tease 
him mercilessly: “You’re a glutton for punishment”; “You’re go-
ing to become one of those nerds, like the ones we avoided in high 
school”; “Here comes Mr. Brains”; and “Why struggle, when there 
are so many more fun courses around?” Don felt torn between study-
ing math and keeping up his relationship with his “math downer” 
friends. The comments from his friends eventually became toxic to 
his enthusiasm. He questioned why he needed math anyway. He 
skipped doing homework to spend more time with his friends, and 
pretty soon, he stopped coming to class. Don felt like a failure and 
blamed it on math.
	
Math downers are everywhere. They have a knack for sabotaging 
the advancement of those who like math. You must protect yourself 
from people who put math down and who feed into your own uncer-
tainties and insecurities about doing math. These people are deadly 

68    C H A P T E R   5
to your progress. They can destroy your plan to successfully accom-
plish your math goal. They can throw you off track and prevent your 
journey from reaching a successful conclusion.
	
So be very cautious. Avoid people who speak negatively about 
math. If you must be with these people, don’t talk with them about 
math. Change the subject. Tell them you’d rather not discuss it. And 
make it a rule: Never accept advice from people who are down on 
math. Take anything they say with a grain of salt. Use their nega-
tive opinions only as a challenge to prove they are wrong. Don’t let 
them pull you down. Don’t let them dampen your enthusiasm.
E X E R C I S E  5 - 7  	Caution: Beware of Negative Math Thinkers
Who are the people who bring you down or discourage you in math? Identify 
not only those people who say negative things about math, but also those 
significant people in your life who just don’t seem supportive or interested 
in your math success. It may not only be the negative words they use or the 
lack of supportive words, but their body language or tone of voice may also 
communicate they are math downers. In the space that follows, identify 
those people you should be cautious of when it comes to math. You may use 
only their initials if you feel more comfortable. Then, next to the names, jot 
down effective strategies to handle these people. For example, if you have a 
parent or a roommate who is discouraging you from taking calculus and has 
never valued math, you can get support in other ways: Form a math study 
group on campus, get tutoring at the school’s Learning Resource Center, do 
your homework with a friend in the library, but most important, avoid dis-
cussing math at home. What are other productive ways to deal with these 
math downers?

Positive Thinking Is a Plus Sign   69
7.  Build a Support Group of Positive Math Thinkers
Whenever possible, surround yourself with positive math thinkers, 
people who like math and are succeeding in it. Attach yourself to 
these people and let them become part of your math support group. 
Become their study partners and ask them for advice on homework 
or points you missed in class. I encourage you to broaden your math 
support group. A support group is defined as a group of people who 
support you in the direction you want to go. This will make a world 
of difference in increasing your enthusiasm for studying math.
	
Moreover, don’t forget you may have an incredible resource al-
ready at your fingertips. If you are now in an instructional program, 
the teachers, counselors, advisers, and math department personnel 
at your institution are there to assist you, to help you solve your 
problems, and to further your education. Don’t hesitate to use their 
services. Even if there is, as yet, no formal course or workshop for 
dealing with math anxiety, your mentors may have a wealth of ex-
perience with it and will certainly do everything within their power 
to further your progress. Make them an active and involved part of 
your math support group.
E X E R C I S E  5 - 8  	Identify Your Math Support Group
In the following spaces, identify all those people who are positive math 
thinkers in your life. List those who you are certain enjoy or love math and 
think it is fun and exciting. List those people who think it’s great that you 
are working on overcoming your math fears and anxieties. Write down the 
names of people who are encouraging your progress on the road to success 
in math. Even if at first you can’t think of many people, look around, reach 
out to others, search for at least ten people who could be part of your posi-
tive math thinkers support group.

Believe You Will Succeed
Whether you believe you can do something or believe you can’t—you’re 
right! —Henry Ford
All of our experiences in life are viewed through our own belief-
­filtering system. If you believe in something, whether it is good or 
bad, it becomes true for you, and in effect, it becomes a reality. It is 
like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once we believe we can do something, 
we start behaving in ways to make it happen. Our beliefs are like 
magnets. Once you believe something is possible, your mind seeks 
ways and means to assure it will definitely happen.
	
The belief in success is the one great driving force behind all suc-
cessful students. Believe you will succeed in reaching your math goal 
and you will! Having a positive belief creates the energy, the momen-
tum, and the means needed to accomplish your goal. It fills you with 
vitality and vigor to charge ahead and to creatively deal with any 
obstacle that enters your path.
	
Beliefs can be very empowering in our lives. They tap into the 
richest resources deep within us. It is belief that activates your mind 
to find constructive ways and alternatives to reach your goals. Devel-
op a positive belief system about math and success is sure to follow. 
Negative beliefs stop you in your path.

Express Legitimate Math Rights
To act on legitimate personal rights is an essential part of learning to 
be a more assertive person. Similarly, to express your legitimate math 
rights is important in affirming both your desire and your ability to 
achieve math success. Sandra Davis at the University of Minnesota 
adapted an assertive bill of rights approach for the math anxious.
	
The list of rights in Exercise 5-11 goes further and constitutes a 
set of guidelines that may be helpful to you in most situations deal-
ing with math. This is only a partial list, and you may want to add 
to it. I encourage you to act upon these rights but not to follow them 
blindly. I suggest you evaluate these rights, change them in ways to 
suit you, and use them in conjunction with good personal judgment.
E X E R C I S E  5 - 1 1  Identify Your Math Rights
Read aloud the following math rights. Do you agree with them? What other 
rights should be included? Check the rights upon which you are willing to 
act. Make a commitment, today, to assertively act upon your legitimate 
math rights!
_____	 I have the right to enjoy math.
_____	 I have the right to achieve my math goal.
_____	 I have the right to ask questions of my math teachers.
_____	 I have the right to ask “Why?”
_____	 I have the right to say “I don’t know” or “I don’t understand.”

Summary
Maintain a positive attitude toward math and your ability to do 
math—this is the supercharger propelling you along the road to 
your math success goal. Utilize positive math affirmations, create 
personal guiding metaphors, write the math winner’s ad campaign, 
use the language of a math winner, build a math support group, 
and change disempowering math beliefs to more reasonable ones. 
These are just a few of the powerful strategies offered in this chap-
ter, strategies to encourage the development of positive attitudes, 
positive thinking, and increased enthusiasm toward doing math. I 
encourage you to tell yourself at every opportunity: You can and will 
succeed in reaching your goal. Tell yourself: “You are a winner and 
you can do math.” Believe you will succeed in reaching your math 
goal and you will!

I believe I have discovered the one great, moving, compelling force which 
makes every man what he becomes in the end.
	
This, I believe, is the greatest force in the universe. I believe all other 
causes are secondary to it. It is so powerful that the slightest human effort 
cannot be put forth until it has done its work; and if it should suddenly 
be annihilated from the world, all activity would come to a standstill, and 
humanity would become a mass of automatons moving about in meaning-
less circles.
	
This force is not love; it is not religion; it is not virtue; it is not 
­ambition—for none of these could exist an hour without it. . . . It is 
imagination. —Clarence Budington Kelland (1881–1964)
	
Your imagination is the creative expression of your mind. It helps 
produce your present and future reality. Once you understand this 
marvelous visionary ability within your mind, you can use your visu-
alization skills to construct an environment conducive to achieving 
math success.
	
We all visualize or see images in our minds all the time. Take 
worry, for example: Do you know anyone who doesn’t? Of course not. 
Everyone worries at one time or another. But what do we do when 
we worry? We imagine the worst thing that could go wrong or that 
could happen in a particular situation. We put energy into picturing 
the negative.

Bob worried he wouldn’t find a math teacher he liked. He was 
always afraid that his teacher would go too fast, wouldn’t explain 
things sufficiently, wouldn’t understand him, and on and on. His con-
stant worrying exhausted him emotionally and interfered with his 
ability to enjoy any math class he attended. Bob, with his negative 
mental images, succeeded in creating his own negative reality. Be-
cause of his strong visualization powers, he always saw his teachers 
in the worst possible light.
	
In this chapter, we work with your visualization powers. But 
rather than allow you to put your energy into the negative and visu-
alize the worst things that can happen, I will ask you to visualize the 
positive and to harness your creative energies to realize your fullest 
potential.
	
Much research illustrates the benefits of visualizing or mentally 
practicing an upcoming event. One such example comes from the 
sports world. A well-known study (Richardson, 1969) shows how 
visualization can improve the free-throw scores of basketball play-
ers. It demonstrates the positive effects of “symbolic rehearsal” of an 
athletic activity without any large muscle movements.
	
Richardson randomly chose three groups of students, all of whom 
had never practiced visualization techniques. One group of students 
was asked to practice free throws every day for 20 days. A second 
group was asked to make free throws on the first day and again on 
the twentieth, without any practice throwing basketballs in between. 
The last group was also asked to shoot free throws on the first and 
the twentieth days. But in addition, this group was instructed to do 
something quite different. Participants were asked to take 20 min-
utes each day and visualize themselves sinking baskets. As in real 
life, when these students saw themselves miss a basket, they were 
encouraged to work to improve their aim on the next throw.
	
The results of this study are fascinating. Richardson found that 
the first group, the students who practiced free throws every day for 
20 days, improved their ability by 24%. The second group, who threw 
baskets on the first and the twentieth days only, as you might expect, 
showed no improvement at all. The last group, who imagined sink-
ing baskets, improved a whopping 23%! Thus, although they lacked 
actual physical practice, the last group improved almost as much as 
the group that practiced for 20 days. Amazing results—and group

three might have done even better, if not for one student. This stu-
dent could visualize the basketball court, but each time he imagined 
bouncing the ball, the ball stuck to the floor of the court. From this 
experiment, Richardson concluded it is important to control or pre-
cisely structure our imagery. It is best to imagine smooth sailing and 
the overcoming of any obstacles when using visualization techniques 
for positive goal achievement.
Program Yourself to Succeed
Emil Coué, a 19th-century French pharmacist, once wrote, “The 
power of the imagination is greater than that of the will.” He said, 
although you may want something very badly, or “will” it to happen, 
it won’t happen unless you imagine it. You must see it in your mind’s 
eye. You must really imagine it being true for you.
	
“Programmed Positive Visualization” (PPV) is a technique to help 
you visualize very clearly whatever changes you want to make in 
your life and to see your life as you want it to be. It is the deliberate 
use of the power of your imagination to create your own positive, de-
sired reality. This method can help you consciously change or repro-
gram your thinking pattern and help you achieve all you desire.
	
PPV is an incredibly powerful tool when used to improve your 
math abilities. You might rehearse an upcoming math exam, imag-
ine yourself calm and clear in math class, mentally practice asking 
your teacher for help outside class, or perhaps see yourself solve 
equations and difficult problems with ease. You can program yourself 
to succeed in math!
	
Here are guidelines to set up your own programmed visualization:
	
1. Decide what you’d like to do or what situation you’d like to 
im­prove. State clearly to yourself the math goal you would like to 
­accomplish.
	
2. Truly want what you imagine. The fewer doubts you have, the 
greater your visualization power.
	
3. Some of the relaxation techniques you practiced in Chapter 3 
are particularly useful here. When you visualize, allow yourself to be 
open, positive, and deeply relaxed.

Win with “Success in Math Visualizations”   77
	
4. Picture yourself doing exactly what you want to do, achieving 
precisely what you want to achieve, creating just what you want to 
create.
	
5. Build a sequence of positive, powerful steps or events in your 
mind portraying the fulfillment of your goal. Have each step clearly 
take you in the direction you want to go. Don’t imagine difficulties or 
failures. Picture yourself overcoming all obstacles. Visualize only the 
progressive movement toward success and achievement.
	
6. Your visualization will be more effective if you are aware of the 
sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and the feel of what you visualize. The 
more complete and lifelike the experience, the better. Some people 
find they don’t actually see images when they visualize, but they can 
feel, sense, or have the impression or sensation of the ­images.
	
7. Choose affirmations to help you feel good and reinforce your 
progressive movement toward achieving math success. You may 
choose some positive statements from Chapter 5 or make up new 
ones. State your affirmations to yourself over and over again during 
your visualization.
	
8. Trust and believe what you want will be yours. Push any nega-
tive thoughts away. Believe you can and will attain the success you 
work toward and visualize in your life. Do not discuss your visualiza-
tion plan with anyone. Avoid exposure to others’ doubts or negative 
thoughts.
	
9. Once you have designed your visualization, decide on a specific 
time each day to relax deeply and go through this imagery. Bring 
yourself into a comfortably relaxed state and repeat your positive 
affirmations to yourself several times. Next, visualize a gradual 
progression through the steps leading to your goal, and end with the 
image of your goal successfully achieved.
	
10. Each day, no matter where you are—in your car, on your way 
to class, exercising—visualize your goal and create positive images 
of achievement in your mind. Always picture the goal as exciting and 
stimulating. See yourself as successful now!
	
11. Continue this process of relaxation and visualization each day 
until your math success goal becomes a reality for you. You may then 
want to repeat this process with a new goal and visualization.
	
The “Success in Math Visualization” (Exercise 6-1) was designed 
to help you achieve your math success goal. You can listen to this 

78    C H A P T E R   6
­exercise on track four of the CD accompanying this workbook. Listen 
to it often.
E X E R C I S E  6 - 1  	“Success in Math Visualization”
Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted. Sit comfortably with 
your eyes closed. Focus on the gentle rhythm of your breathing. Breathe 
slowly, deeply, and regularly. With every inhalation, feel your abdomen rise, 
and with every exhalation, feel it fall. Experience all the tightness and ten-
sion leaving your body with every breath you exhale. Relax more and more. 
Go deeper and deeper into a calm and serene state.
	
Now, with every breath you inhale, say to yourself . . . “I am” . . . and 
with your exhalation, say “relaxed.” As you breathe in, say . . . “I am” . . . 
and as you breathe out, say “relaxed.”
	
Continue alone for 5 minutes.
	
Visualize these positive math affirmations as true and say to yourself 
(pause 5 to 8 seconds between statements):
Deep within my mind, I can see and experience myself relax while do-
ing math.
Deep within me, I can see and feel myself comfortable and confident 
while in math class.
Every day in every way, my ability to do math is improving.
I enjoy math more and more each day.
I allow myself to remain calm, confident, and comfortable while work-
ing out math problems.
Each day, math is easier for me.
I can clearly visualize succeeding in math.
Every day in every way, math is more fun and exciting.
Deep within me, I know I am truly capable and competent to do math.
Deep within my mind, I see and experience the attainment of my math 
success goal.
	
Now I would like you to imagine that you are about to do math and that 
you have your books and notes before you. You have plenty of paper and 
pencils, and you know you have everything you need. You take a few deep, 
comfortable breaths and calm yourself before beginning to study and work 
out math problems. See yourself calm, relaxed, confident. Say to yourself, “I 
remain calm and relaxed while doing math.”

Then visualize yourself concentrating completely on math with your 
studying progressing well. See yourself understanding your math and hav-
ing the concepts coming easily and readily to you. Tell yourself, “I can un-
derstand math if I give myself a chance.”
	
Picture yourself reading over your math notes. Envision yourself re-
viewing all the important points and quizzing yourself on the concepts. 
Tell yourself, “I review all the important concepts over and over again to fix 
them in my mind.”
	
Imagine concentrating on your work, alert, interested, and enthusiastic. 
Picture yourself working out math problems, the easy as well as the very 
difficult and challenging ones. Tell yourself, “Working out math problems is 
fun.” 
	
Imagine yourself, after working for about half an hour, taking a 
5-­minute study break to refresh your mind and energize your body. Stretch 
your whole body, reach for the sky, bend down and touch your toes; move 
around, get some water to drink or an apple to eat. After your break, settle 
back into your chair, close your eyes for a moment, and take some deep, re-
laxing breaths. Then visualize yourself resuming study with renewed vigor 
and confidence. Say to yourself, “Math studying is going well for me.”
	
Now let us conclude your “Success in Math Visualization” by imagin-
ing the long-term benefits of confidence and competence in math. Imagine 
achieving your math success goal. Take the next few minutes to visualize 
mastery of your goal. Delight in your math success now!
	
How do you feel about yourself and your abilities? How would life be 
different if you succeeded in reaching your goal? What other benefits would 
follow as a result of this? Focus on those benefits now! Say to yourself, “Ev-
ery day in every way, I am working toward achieving my math goal.”
	
Conclude this visualization exercise by saying, “Deep within my mind, I 
visualize and experience myself achieving my math success goal.”
E X E R C I S E  6 - 2  	Rehearse a Forthcoming Math Situation
Do you get nervous before math class? Does it frighten you to visit your in-
structor’s office and ask for help?
	
To help you deal with these difficult situations, I suggest you practice 
this simple technique. Take about 10 minutes to relax and calm yourself 
down. Do some Deep Abdominal Breathing or the natural Calming Breath 

80    C H A P T E R   6
described in Chapter 3. Once you feel calm, imagine the difficult situation, 
and then visualize yourself calmly and peacefully handling it with compe-
tence, self-assuredness, and adeptness. See the situation going well for you, 
and you remain calm and composed throughout. This visualization should 
be practiced several times in the days before the actual event occurs. It is 
particularly important to practice it in the half-hour preceding the event.
Build Confidence
Most students who are successful and confident in math or any other 
subject have learned the one important thing that sustains them: 
focus on the positive.
	
Successful students have a storehouse of positive images in their 
memory to readily recall whenever the going gets rough. Past posi-
tive experiences are the foundation for future successful ones. If stu-
dents recall only positive, pleasant experiences related to math, they 
boost their confidence whenever they need to.
	
Is your memory bank a powerhouse of positive images?
	
Here is an exercise to help you deposit only positive images in 
your memory bank.
E X E R C I S E  6 - 3  	A Memory Bank of Positive Images
Each night before going to sleep, think of positive, enjoyable math experi-
ences. Don’t be hard on yourself. Evoke only good, pleasurable images. 
Recall even the smallest accomplishments. Perhaps you remember being 
proud of yourself as a child for learning the times-tables, or when you got 
the best grade on a math quiz in the seventh grade, or when you did your 
tax return on your own. Begin to deposit these good math images in your 
memory. This process will boost your confidence and improve your self-
­esteem about doing math.
	
A variation of this exercise is to take a notebook and record all your 
successes in math. This can help build your sense of accomplishment and 
self-worth. You need not record major math accomplishments. For example, 
Dana recorded her correct response when called upon in math class, Marisa 
wrote she felt successful every time she balanced her checkbook, and 
­Matthew noted he finally understood quadratic equations.

Successful students build their confidence on all the little accomplish-
ments accumulated and stored in their memories. Allow the challenge of 
math to confront all the strength and power of your memory. Whenever 
necessary, simply draw on this powerhouse of good math memories. There 
are no penalties for early withdrawal—only lots and lots of interest!
Anchor Confidence
Wouldn’t it be wonderful to always be confident and capable when do-
ing math problems or taking a math class? And if at times you weren’t, 
wouldn’t you like the power to just snap your fingers and magically 
feel self-assured and proficient? Well, you can through anchoring. 
	
Anchoring is a very powerful technique to instantly retrieve 
past moments when you felt assured, adept, successful, competent, 
and great about yourself. You can learn to associate these past posi-
tive feelings, thoughts, or states of being with any current action or 
event.
	
Anchoring is a concept found in the work of Richard Bandler, John 
Grinder, and other pioneers of neuro-linguistic programming. Using 
anchoring, you can evoke or visualize a past positive success experi-
ence and use this experience now to help you feel more positive about 
math. Anthony Robbins, in his dynamic book, Unlimited Power (1997), 
says anchoring “can create the state you desire in any situation with-
out your having to think about it. When you anchor something effec-
tively enough, it will be there whenever you want it” (p. 274).
	
Have you ever had the experience of smelling a freshly baked 
cherry pie, and suddenly, you felt transported in time to childhood 
when your grandmother had baked you a cherry pie? The good feel-
ings of being with your grandmother, or thoughts of your grand­
mother’s house, may return. In this case, the cherry pie acted as your 
“anchor” to the past, helping you retrieve the thoughts and feelings 
of that time in your history. Or perhaps you heard a song you hadn’t 
heard in many years, and it brought on a nostalgic feeling of bygone 
days. The song acted as your anchor.
	
Most anchoring occurs without our awareness of the process, but 
you can consciously use this technique to increase your level of math 
confidence. Exercise 6-4 will help you do this.

82    C H A P T E R   6
E X E R C I S E  6 - 4  	Anchor Confidence in Math
	1.	 Arrange to be alone in a quiet setting where you will not be disturbed. 
Sit comfortably with your eyes closed. Breathe slowly and deeply, and 
gradually calm your body and mind.
	2.	 Now, while in a relaxed state, go back over your life to a time when you 
felt very successful, extremely confident, unbelievably capable and com-
petent. When you evoke this memory, establish a clear mental image of 
it. Allow yourself to reexperience this time in your history. What were the 
sights, the smells, the feel, the sounds, and the tastes? How did you look, 
act, and respond to others? How did others treat you? What thoughts and 
feelings did you have? Let yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally 
“feel” the full impact of this experience of total confidence. Hold your head 
and body the way you did when you felt this way. Notice your shoulders 
and the position of your spinal column. Breathe the way you did then. At 
the peak of this reexperienced state, go immediately to step 3.
	 	 	
If you can’t identify a time when you felt confident and capable, cre-
ate your own programmed visualization where you see yourself feeling 
extremely confident and capable. Again, be sure to experience this image 
fully, on the physical, mental, and emotional levels. At the peak of this 
experience, go to step 3.
	3.	 At the peak of feeling confident and capable, snap your fingers (or if you 
prefer, clap your hands, touch your thumb and index finger together, 
or do something similar) to establish your anchor. As you do this, you 
anchor the positive state of confidence and capability to the snapping of 
your fingers.
	4.	 Repeat steps 2 and 3 several times in the next few days with other 
positive memories or visualizations; each time, get increasingly into the 
feeling of complete confidence and self-assuredness. At the height of ex-
periencing this strong powerful state of confidence, be sure to anchor the 
state to your snapping.
	5.	 Soon you’ll discover that by just snapping your fingers, you can instantly 
feel confident and capable. Whenever you are doing math or sitting in 
math class and you need a confidence boost, snap you fingers! A flood of 
positive feelings and images will immediately come into your conscious-
ness and help you feel better.

Mary, a premed major, used anchoring to help her feel better 
about taking math. She had been out of school many years, and 
when she returned, she found herself very anxious and insecure in 
her math class. Following the steps in Exercise 6-4, she learned that 
snapping her fingers instantaneously brought back a stream of good 
thoughts associated with competence and success. Mary’s anchor 
(snapping her fingers) helped her reexperience the feelings of being 
the sixth-grade statewide spelling champion, of earning an A on her 
seventh-grade math final, of receiving an award at high school grad-
uation, and it helped her visualize herself successfully graduating 
from medical school. Whenever she became fearful or nervous while 
doing math or when called upon in math class, she’d snap her fingers 
and a calm sense of success, competence, and assuredness would 
come to her. Backed by these positive feelings, she could think more 
clearly, figure out her math more easily, and watch her skillfulness 
increase.
E X E R C I S E  6 - 5  	Visualize Metaphors for Success
Assume a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take slow, deep breaths 
and allow yourself to become increasingly relaxed. In this exercise, I first 
want you to picture in your mind something about math that makes you 
feel anxious or uncomfortable. I want you to give life to this image by liken-
ing it to an unpleasant but not unfamiliar scene. Here are some examples of 
images my students have visualized for discomfort and anxiety:
	1.	 Stuck in a deep pit in the ground
	2.	 Feeling claustrophobic in a long, dark tunnel
	3.	 Being in the spotlight in a lineup
	4.	 A wounded animal
	5.	 A tangled, tightly made knot
	
What images best describe your discomfort?

84    C H A P T E R   6
	
Now, during your visualization, allow these images to gradually lighten 
up, fade, soften, and become more relaxing. While you visualize new meta-
phoric images, repeat reinforcing positive affirmations. For example:
1.	 While in the deep pit, the sun begins to shine in, and you notice a ladder 
is tucked away in the corner. See yourself using the ladder to climb out 
of the pit. Say the affirmation, “I am able to deal effectively with math.”
2.	 The long, dark tunnel suddenly opens up onto a sunny bright seashore 
with a cool breeze. Repeat the affirmation, “Math is becoming easier and 
easier for me to understand.”
3.	 The lineup spotlight fades into a soft, glowing lantern, illuminating you 
under the stars on a romantic evening. Say the affirmation, “I enjoy 
math more each day.”
4.	 The wounded animal begins to heal and soon is completely recovered 
and stronger than before. Repeat the affirmation, “I know I am capable, 
confident, and competent to do my math.”
5.	 The tight knot is loosened and untangled. State the affirmation, “I allow 
myself to remain relaxed and calm when doing math.”
E X E R C I S E  6 - 6  	My Brilliant (Math) Career
If someone made a home video of your life that you could view later, you 
would find your memory of the past conflicted with what actually ­happened.
	
If you associate a negative feeling with a past experience, realize two 
things. First, “negative” is a judgment about an experience, but it is not the 
experience itself. The judgment is made by your conscious mind. Second, 
realize the only thing that really happened is you formed a perception about 
an event, and this perception now colors your thinking.
	
Now that you’ve developed your own ad campaign to promote your 
new image as a math winner (Exercise 5-5), go one step further. Become a 
movie producer and write, direct, produce, and star in the Academy Award-
­winning movie, My Brilliant (Math) Career, which chronicles your life from 
early successes and triumphs in math to your current state of proficiency 
and accomplishment. Be sure to dramatize fully the early scenes—in Tech-
nicolor, Dolby, and Surround Sound—where you shrugged off a reprimand 
or made light of an embarrassing moment at school and went on to perse-
vere and prove your math prowess to the entire world (fanfare composed by 
John Williams)!

Summary
With “Programmed Positive Visualization,” you can program yourself 
to succeed in math. In this section of our road map, we examined 
strategies to reprogram negative thinking, to rehearse an upcoming 
event, to build and anchor confidence in math, and to create a memory 
bank of positive imagery for math success.

As far back as she could remember, Ashley had great difficulty with 
math. Learning from either the chalkboard or lectures was frus-
trating. She had trouble concentrating on math for more than 15 
minutes at a time. Her mind would wander, and she’d want to do 
something—anything—but sit in one place. She’d get restless, move 
around, and want to talk to others, or leave the room. As a child, she 
was reprimanded for this behavior, and early on, she developed a 
strong dislike for math.
	
While working with Ashley, I discovered she needed to be physi-
cally involved in the learning process. When she manipulated things 
with her hands or moved her body while learning, math came easily 
to her. Hands-on activities, measuring devices, abacuses, beads, seeds, 
beans, and other physical objects helped her understand and learn 
math. She needed to walk or pace back and forth as she studied. This 
helped clear her mind and increase her concentration so she could un-
derstand more. I also found she needed to munch on carrots or celery 
sticks as she studied. Munching kept her energy level and motivation 
high. So she needed to keep vegetables on hand, cleaned, and ready to 
eat. Working under these unique study conditions, Ashley was able to 
bring up her math grade by a grade and a half.
	
Jon found he studied best by himself, late at night, under a bright 
light in the quiet of his room. He could study at other times of the 
day, but night was when he did his best thinking. He noticed he was 
more creative then, and he could easily solve even the most difficult 
math problems. Jon also discovered when the room temperature was 
between 67 and 70 degrees, he could function at his top proficiency 
level. If the room was much warmer, he became lethargic and sleepy.

Following this study routine, Jon learned his math quickly and more 
effectively.
	
What type of learner are you? How do you learn math best? How 
can you set up your learning environment so you can perform most 
effectively? This section of our road map will help you enhance your 
ability to learn math. It is designed to reveal your own personal 
learning style and the conditions under which you learn best. As you 
learn math more easily, your math fears will gradually decrease.
	
Would you like to know what you can do to improve your under-
standing and retention of new and difficult math concepts? Would 
you like to discover what positively affects your powers of concentra-
tion? By gaining an awareness of your personal learning style, you’ll 
be able to improve in these areas.
	
Your learning style has been forged from a unique mixture of 
personal attributes and preferences, individual background, child-
hood experiences, and environmental cues of all kinds. By knowing 
how these factors influence you, you’ll be able to intentionally choose 
the most effective learning environment and strategies to meet your 
individual needs.
	
Learning styles can make a big difference in your life. By un-
derstanding and working with your unique learning style, you can 
greatly enhance your math achievement. You’ll study better, feel 
more excited about learning math, and your test scores will be 
­higher. What’s more, you’ll feel a greater measure of self-control.
Perceptual Learning Channels
Your perceptual preference may be one of the most significant fac-
tors influencing your ability to learn and recall math. Three major 
perceptual learning channels have been identified: visual, auditory, 
and kinesthetic/tactile. People who are visual learners learn best if 
they see or visualize words and numbers written out. Auditory learn-
ers generally learn best if they hear math explained to them or if 
they say math to themselves. Kinesthetic/tactile learners need to be 
involved in the learning process through touch or whole-body move-
ment. You may find one channel is dominant for you and a second 
one further strengthens your learning.

Professor Rita Dunn, Director of the Center for the Study and 
Teaching of Learning Styles at St. John’s University in New York, has 
found when students are introduced to new material through the per-
ceptual channel they prefer most, they remember significantly more 
than when they are taught through their least preferred channel. In 
addition, if the new material is further reinforced through secondary 
or tertiary perceptual preferences, they achieve even more.
	
Here is an exercise designed to help you determine which percep-
tual channel you prefer most for learning math.

Suggestions for Distinctive Learning Channels
Visual Learners
Are you a strong visual learner? Do you find you must see math 
problems written on the chalkboard or on paper before you can begin 
to comprehend what is being asked of you? Would it drive you crazy 
if you had to listen to a math lecture and you had nothing to write 
with or if the teacher wrote nothing on the board?
	
Ted, a construction worker, returned to college after being out 
of school for almost 10 years. He really wanted to get his college 
degree, but math was terribly frustrating to him. He could easily 
copy everything his instructor put on the chalkboard, but he was 
completely lost with the lecture. Math just didn’t make sense to him 
when he listened to it. Ted learned he is a strong visual learner but 
a weak auditory learner. Once he understood how he learned, he be-
gan using strategies to help him gain the most from his math classes 
and his studying. Soon Ted’s math achievement and his enjoyment of 

Enhance Your Learning Style   91
math began to improve. Ted has continued to take math courses and 
is now doing well in calculus and loving it.
	
These strategies will help if you are a strong visual learner but 
are weak in the auditory channel.
	
1.	 Always take written notes when someone is explaining math 
to you.
	
2.	 Whenever possible, ask for written instructions.
	
3.	 Make your own drawings or diagrams when figuring out 
word problems.
	
4.	 Use flashcards to review all important concepts, formulas, 
theorems, equations, and explanations.
	
5.	 Write as much as you can when you study. Work out lots of 
problems.
	
6.	 In lecture, concentrate on what the instructor is writing on 
the chalkboard and copy everything down. If you can’t get 
much of what the teacher explains in class, bring a voice 
recorder. Always reset the counter on the recorder to zero at 
the beginning of the lecture. At points in the lecture when 
you don’t fully understand what the teacher says, note the 
counter number on the recorder and put it down in your 
notes. Later, you can listen carefully to the recording, paying 
attention to the sections where you jotted down the counter 
numbers. Write down the information that you missed get-
ting the first time.
	
7.	 Use two or more math books. Read how different authors ex-
plain the topics you learn. Because this is such a good study-
skills technique in general, I will discuss it in further detail 
in Chapter 8.
	
8.	 Visualize in your mind’s eye the math concepts you are 
­learning.
	
9.	 Whenever possible, use computer programs to illustrate con-
cepts you are learning.
	
10.	 Read your textbook assignment and previous class notes be-
fore your next class.
	
11.	 Use workbooks, supplemental study guides, CDs, videos, or 
handouts.
	
12.	 Map out, chart, or in some way graphically illustrate your 
classroom and textbook notes.

92    C H A P T E R   7
	
13.	 Always write in your textbook. Underline key words. Mark 
important concepts and use colored pencils to liven them up.
	
14.	 Sit near the front of your classroom to avoid visual distrac-
tions and to pay closer attention to your instructor.
	
15.	 When you review your classroom notes, creatively highlight 
the important points with colored pencils or markers.
Auditory Learners
Are you primarily an auditory learner? Do you prefer to have some-
one explain math to you rather than read about it or see it on paper? 
Do you often have to repeat math problems aloud or in your head 
before you can figure them out? Do you just hate it when a teacher 
shows the class how to figure out a math problem on the board but 
doesn’t explain each step aloud while writing it?
	
The following suggestions will be particularly helpful if you are a 
strong auditory learner but are weak in the visual area.
	
1.	 Sit near the front of the classroom so you can clearly hear 
your teacher without auditory distractions.
	
2.	 You may want to use a voice recorder during lectures and 
listen to each lecture as soon after class as possible. Listen to 
it over and over again, when you drive, study, jog, or do your 
chores.
	
3.	 Take part in classroom discussions.
	
4.	 Ask lots of questions in class, after class, and in help ses-
sions. Ask for clarification if you don’t completely follow an 
explanation in class.
	
5.	 Restate, in your own words, math concepts you are trying to 
understand.
	
6.	 Ask your math teacher to repeat important concepts.
	
7.	 Listen carefully to the math lecture. Mentally follow the 
­concepts and then write them down to capture what was 
said.
	
8.	 If you can’t get everything the teacher writes on the chalk-
board, find a classmate who seems to be a visual learner and 
is writing down everything from the board. Ask if you could 
photocopy this person’s class notes.

Enhance Your Learning Style   93
	
9.	 When figuring out a difficult homework assignment, you may 
want to read it aloud into a voice recorder and then listen to 
it and write it down.
	
10.	 Immediately after you read your math textbook assignment, 
recite aloud what you have just learned.
	
11.	 Read your class notes and textbook notes aloud. Whenever 
possible, say them in your own words into a voice recorder.
	
12.	 Talk about math to a study partner or to anyone who will 
listen. (I know some students who have even explained their 
assignments to their pets.)
	
13.	 Listen for key words in your math lecture. Note if your in-
structor emphasizes certain points through tone of voice, 
enunciation of certain words, voice inflections, and so on.
	
14.	 Record all the key concepts, formulas, explanations, and 
theorems on a voice recorder, and listen to them often.
Kinesthetic/Tactile Learners
Was your score on the perceptual learning channel assessment high-
est in the kinesthetic/tactile area? Do you prefer a real-life experi-
ence with math, manipulating it and experimenting with it? Do you 
find you like to move around when you study, pace the floor, or shift 
positions a lot?
	
These strategies will help if you are a kinesthetic/tactile learner:
	
1.	 You must use a hands-on approach to learning. Work out as 
many math problems as possible. Do, do, do. Practice, prac-
tice, practice. You’ll be amazed at the positive results.
	
2.	 Whenever possible, convert what you are learning in math 
to real-life concrete experiences. If applicable, use measur-
ing cups, measuring vials, toothpicks, seeds, stones, marbles, 
paper clips, rulers, sticks.
	
3.	 If someone shows you how to do a problem, immediately ask 
if you could work out a similar one to see if you understand 
how to do it.
	
4.	 While studying, try to solve problems several different ways 
to decide which method feels right to you.

94    C H A P T E R   7
	
5.	 Many kinesthetic/tactile learners find they must move dur-
ing the learning process. You may want to walk to and fro 
while reading your assignment or even while working out 
problems. Some students like to rock back and forth. Others 
need to shift positions frequently. The movement increases 
understanding and comprehension for some highly kines-
thetic people.
	
6.	 Use computers and workbooks.
	
7.	 While you exercise or engage in other types of physical activi-
ties, review your math concepts in your mind.
	
8.	 Use your fingers and even your toes if this helps when you 
figure out math problems.

Enhance Your Learning Style   95
	
9.	 Rewrite class notes.
	
10.	 Use a calculator to solve problems.
	
11.	 If possible, use or build models to help you understand the 
math concepts you learn.
	
12.	 Study math on an exercise bike—preferably one with an 
­attached reading stand allowing you to move your arms and 
legs.
Strengthen All Areas
I recommend you strengthen and interrelate all your perceptual 
learning channels. For example, recite aloud what a diagram or 
chart represents so you both see and hear the information. You may 
also redraw it or write out an explanation of it so you can be kines-
thetically involved. Each channel reinforces the other. This is par-
ticularly helpful because you may not have the luxury of being in a 
course where the instructor teaches to your preferred learning style. 
I believe that if you strengthen all modes of learning, you’ll be bet-
ter able to process information on both sides of your brain. Then, if 
you don’t recall the information you’ve learned one way, you may be 
able to recall it through another. So see the information, say it, hear 
it, write it down, feel it, visualize it, read it, and manipulate or work 
with it in as many ways as you can.
A Sequential versus a Global Learning Style
When learning math, it is important to be aware of how you take in, 
interact with, and process the new information and demands of the 
situation. If you understand your approach to new material, you can

Sequential learners tend to learn in small incremental steps. 
They follow a step-by-step approach; using little pieces of knowledge, 
they learn to advance them in a logical, linear order to the next step, 
then the next step, and so on. This sequential approach helps them 
solve math problems without necessarily fully understanding the 
math concepts with which they are working. 
	
If this learning style describes you, you are fortunate because 
throughout the educational system many teachers and textbook 

96    C H A P T E R   7
authors use a sequential approach when presenting material. Math 
textbooks are usually presented in a sequential order, as are many 
lectures, lesson plans, syllabi, and math curricula. 
	
On the other hand, this approach might not characterize you at 
all. Perhaps when you take in little bits and pieces of math knowl-
edge, they appear disjointed or unrelated. You don’t see or appreciate 
a step-by-step logical sequence. The information presented seems 
irrelevant and doesn’t make sense. You feel as if you are stumbling 
around in the dark, progressing slowly or not at all. But you may 
have had the experience where you suddenly see the whole picture 
clearly. Everything miraculously comes together like a puzzle. Aha—
you get it! In one fell swoop, you finally see it all. All the bits and 
pieces now make sense. You have found the light switch after trying 
all the switches in the dark mansion. Now you can see the room in 
which you are standing, but another surprising thing happens. You 
can see into the adjacent rooms, and the rooms beyond those, and 
even into the grounds outside. The light illuminates far more than 
your immediate surroundings. 
	
What I’ve just described is the experience that many global learn-
ers have had. Once global learners grasp the concepts, they tend to 
make connections and have a more universal view of what they learn 
than other types of learners. They can see the interrelation and ap-
plication of these new concepts to other things they already know. 
They may be able to solve difficult problems in new and innovative 
ways once they obtain an understanding of the whole. Explaining 
how they achieved an answer can be difficult for global learners be-
cause of the huge leaps in understanding they are able to suddenly 
take.
	
Global learners have the potential to be very creative thinkers not 
only because they can take large leaps in their understanding, but 
also because they can apply what they have learned to other areas 
in their studies, careers, or personal lives. So being a global thinker 
definitely has its advantages. But it has its disadvantages also. 
	
The problem global learners experience is that it takes them quite 
a while before they can see how the bits and pieces of information fit 
into the greater scheme of things. Without grasping the entire pic-
ture, the small bits of information seem senseless to them. They may 
struggle with new concepts, homework, and problem solving. 

Enhance Your Learning Style   97
	
Since global learners don’t learn in the traditional manner, these 
learners may feel dumb, out of sync with their classmates, and unable 
to perform well or meet their instructors’ expectations. They may be-
come discouraged when they try to grasp the whole picture and can’t 
quite get it, while their classmates appear to function quite well.
	
If you are one of these global learners, I encourage you not to 
give up when learning math. Both the sequential and the global ap-
proaches to learning are important. As I have said, global learners 
have the potential to be very creative because they can take large 
leaps and apply what they have learned to other areas.
	
Here are some suggestions to help you if you are a strong global 
learner:
	
1.	 Continue to learn new information, even if you don’t readily 
see the whole picture. Don’t give up.
	
2.	 Keep taking in as many facts and bits of information as you 
can, until eventually you’ll be able to grasp the complete pic-
ture. Before you tackle a new chapter in your textbook, skim 
the whole chapter and get a feel for its overall theme.
	
3.	 Be patient with yourself. Know that the big picture will ap-
pear. Know that understanding will come.
	
4.	 When you learn a sequence of steps in a math operation, ask 
your teacher or your math tutor for the operation’s goal or 
overview. Ask for help to see the whole picture.
	
5.	 Work with your teacher, a tutor, or other classmates to explore 
how you can apply the new information you learn to other new 
concepts, to concepts you previously learned, and to ideas in 
other courses and disciplines. Seek out ways this new infor-
mation is relevant in your everyday life.
	
6.	 Whenever you have a chance, give yourself a large chunk of 
time to study your math. Extra time gives you more of an op-
portunity to synthesize, connect, and make sense of the many 
bits and pieces of information you have learned.
	
7.	 Understand that you have a unique ability to put things to-
gether in new and different ways, and this can be a great ad-
vantage in many careers and jobs.
	
8.	 Relate what you learn to other courses, such as chemistry, 
physics, music, or accounting.

98    C H A P T E R   7
	
9.	 Learn to appreciate the sequential learners’ approach to prob-
lem solving; that is, how each step can build on the next and 
lead in a logical, linear fashion to a problem’s solution. Your 
global approach need not be static. When you use both the 
global and the sequential learning approaches, you are more 
likely to increase your success in math.
Here are some suggestions to help you if you are a strong sequential 
learner:
	
1.	 Be aware that most math textbooks and math lectures follow 
a logical, linear approach. If the step-by-step linear sequence 
is not apparent to you in class, ask your teacher or a math tu-
tor to help you see the flow. Ask for help to fill in any missing 
steps or “in-between” smaller steps that would help you in 
your progress toward your goal. You can also consult different 
math books that explain the same topic and may explain the 
smaller steps that were absent in your lecture.
	
2.	 Drill yourself on the basic procedures you learn so they come 
easily and readily.
	
3.	 When you study and do homework, write out the step-by-step 
procedures for ways to solve problems, and use this approach 
to outline your class notes.
	
4.	 Learn to appreciate the global learners’ approach. Work to 
synthesize everything you learn so you can get the bigger pic-
ture of how the new information fits into previously learned 
concepts and into this course material and related disciplines. 
This will deepen your understanding.
A Deductive versus an Inductive Learning Style
From the time he was quite young, my son’s style, when given a new 
electronic device, was to start to use it immediately, before reading 
the directions. This approach rapidly solidified his functional grasp 
of that machine’s operation. Written materials were used only as a 
last resort (“when all else fails, read the instructions”).

Enhance Your Learning Style   99
	
Contrast this with the style of the person who will not touch a 
gadget before mastering all written directions, methodically working 
through them step by step, and who actually may be intimidated by 
its mechanical aspects (“if all else fails, plug it in”).
	
In between are mixtures of the two extremes—those who com-
bine a common-sense willingness to follow written instructions with 
a spirit of adventure and a readiness to derive flashes of insight from 
a trial-and-error approach.
	
When it comes to learning and applying mathematics, where 
do you fit into this broad analogy? Is your personal thinking style 
to immediately begin to work out and solve problems, allowing the 
insights you gain by doing to give rise to the broader generalizations 
and principles that apply to all similar problems (inductive process)? 
Or do you prefer to assimilate theory and background until you have 
a clear concept of the principles involved, and only then apply them 
to individual problems one at a time (deductive process)?
Doers
Are you an inductive “doer”? If so, you may prefer to do math problems 
before you’ve understood your assignment or the principles involved. 
If this characterizes you, I suggest when you are presented with a 
new math topic, work out lots of problems to get a good feel for that 
particular concept. Attempt to identify the commonalities among the 
problems so you can ascertain the unifying principles involved and 
later apply these principles to other, more difficult problems.
	
Each time you figure out a new principle, test it out to see if it 
really works. See how many different ways the new principle you’ve 
learned can actually be used in real-life examples. This is an excel-
lent approach to enhance your learning, but at times, even this ap-
proach may not be adequate. For example, many doers experience 
anxiety when faced with problems for which the solutions require 
new knowledge and not just number crunching, thus underscoring 
their lack of information. If this happens frequently to you, it would 
be helpful to go back to basics, recognize the deficiency, and develop 
the good study-skills habit of reading the assigned material before 
attempting to do homework problems.

100    C H A P T E R   7
Cogitators
Perhaps you’re a deductive “cogitator.” If you are, you may prefer to 
grasp theory and principle before attempting to do any of the assigned 
problems. This is an excellent approach because it’s certainly easier 
to memorize math rules if you understand them first. But math con-
cepts are often hard to fathom at the onset, and this may cause you 
to get stymied and experience anxiety or distress. If this happens to 
you, try easing into problem solving like sliding into a cool stream, 
gently testing the water. Sometimes, only by working out problems 
do certain principles begin to make sense. First, work through sample 
problems in your textbook that show the solutions step by step. Do as 
many sample problems as you can from your text as well as from other 
textbooks and college course outline series. From there, you can move 
on to problems of progressively increasing difficulty, always doing only 
problems for which the book offers the solution. Keep going back and 
forth between reading the principles and seeing how the principles 
are put into action. This process will help you better understand the 
concepts and principles you’re learning. Whenever you feel stymied 
by a new concept, you need to start to put the principles into practice. 
Soon you’ll feel much more comfortable.

Other Major Factors Affecting Your Learning
We are all biological creatures affected by a bewildering assortment 
of internal and external stimuli. We get hungry and we eat; we get 
full and sleepy; we are startled by noise or lulled by it; we fidget with 
energy or drowse in repose. Our attention is diverted by so many dis-
tractions it’s sometimes hard to imagine getting our brains to focus 
on learning new material. But learn we must. And if we want to do so 
most efficiently, we must analyze these influences and either minimize 
the disturbance they cause or maximize their positive effects.
Time of Day
When is your energy at its highest? Are you an early bird ready to 
go with eagerness and vigor at 6 or 7 in the morning? Or are you 
a night owl like Jon, who was mentioned earlier in this chapter? 
Maybe you feel as if you’re in a fog until 10 a.m., and it would be 
a crime to force you to take an 8 or 9 a.m. math class. Perhaps you 
become a shining star at noon or in the early afternoon. Or possibly, 
you are roaring your engines at 7 p.m. and can go full steam ahead 
until midnight.
	
Lanny, a student in my math anxiety reduction course, said she 
became pretty discouraged with math in high school. She was al-
ways scheduled to take math first thing in the morning, usually a 
7:40 a.m. class. She found she could never concentrate in class and 
couldn’t grasp the concepts. She began to hate math. Now, when she 
looks back at her high school years, she realizes she was a confirmed 
night owl, staying up late each night and never really coming to life 
the next day until around 11 o’clock in the morning. Lanny is still a 
night owl, but now she makes sure she schedules her math classes in 
the afternoon or evening, and she never takes morning classes. She 
studies best after everyone in her family is sleeping soundly.
	
Each of us has times in the day or evening when we perform at 
our peak level of proficiency. If you schedule your math classes or 
math study sessions at these times, you’ll find you can concentrate 
better and learn more. Exercise 7-3 will help you determine the 
hours of your peak performance.

Sound Level
Do you like to study in a very quiet place, free from all distractions? 
For most people, this increases comprehension and the ability to fig-
ure out difficult problems.
	
Francine preferred silence and was easily disturbed by any 
sounds, particularly when she was nervous about an upcoming math 
test. She found wearing small moldable earplugs, which she bought 
at a local pharmacy, did the trick. She wore them every time she 
studied at home or in the library. Her concentration and retention 
levels increased markedly.
	
Other students find silence especially helpful when they work on 
demanding or problematic assignments, but they prefer some back-
ground music or noise when they do a routine or boring assignment 
or when they recopy notes.
	
Still others find, when it’s too quiet, they become “hyperaware” 
of all sounds. Howard, an accounting major, always studies with the 
television or radio on in the next room, although he doesn’t listen to 
it. If it’s too quiet, he hears the refrigerator motor, the ticking of the 
living room clock, and the sounds of his own heartbeat.
	
Harriet, a statistics student, found playing soft, inspiring music 
increased her motivation for studying and the amount of material 
she covered. Tony, a calculus student, learns best when listening to 
music of classical baroque composers. The slow tempo of approxi-
mately one beat per second calms him and clears his mind.

Lighting
How does lighting affect your ability to study and learn? Do you 
study best with natural light coming in from the window? Or maybe 
you like to cuddle under a soft incandescent lamp. Perhaps you func-
tion best under white fluorescent bulbs or a bright halogen light.
	
Some students find bright lights energize them and make them 
more alert and attentive. When the light is subdued, they lose in-
terest easily and become distracted, apathetic, and drowsy. For 
other students, bright lighting has the opposite effect; it makes them 
tense, fidgety, and uncomfortable.
	
Many people feel more relaxed and concentrate better when 
they work in diffused natural light or under balanced full spectrum 
fluorescent lights. Experiment with various lighting conditions and 
figure out for yourself how lighting affects you.

Briefly describe which lighting conditions work best for you when you study 
math.
Temperature
Do you prefer to learn in a cool or a moderately warm room? Some 
students think better when the temperature is cold, whereas others 
find it intolerable and distressing.
	
Each of us has our own unique reaction to temperature. What if 
you’re taking math in a warm classroom and you think better in the 
cold? Why not wear very lightweight clothes to class? Consider sit-
ting near a window or an open door where you might get some cooler 
air, and be sure not to sit under heating ducts. If the opposite situa-
tion occurs and the room is too cold, take extra layers of clothing to 

Enhance Your Learning Style   105
class to keep yourself warm. You also might notice at different times 
of the year or at different times of day, your reaction to environmen-
tal temperature varies. If you’re extra tired, catching a cold, or dis-
turbed by a personal problem, you might feel colder than usual.
E X E R C I S E  7 - 6  	How Does Temperature Affect You? 
(Optional)
Briefly describe which environmental temperature conditions work best for 
you when you study math.
Room Design
Do you like to study in a big, soft, comfortable chair or couch? Or 
maybe you study best at a desk, seated in a nicely cushioned straight-
backed chair. Perhaps you like to sprawl out on a carpeted floor with 
papers and books spread out around you and soft, fluffy pillows to lean 
on. For some students, this eases their tension and motivates them to 
study more.
	
Andrea found if she sat in a comfortable armchair, she soon be-
came sleepy and her eyes closed. She became too relaxed, and she rap-
idly lost all motivation for studying. To do her best, Andrea arranged 
to study at a large, uncluttered desk where she could use the entire 
top surface to spread out her math books, assignments, class notes, 
scratch papers, and practice worksheets. This arrangement helped 
her to see everything clearly and to stay in a problem-solving mode. 
At school, if she sat in a study cubicle in a quiet corner of the library, 
she stayed right on target. She avoided the large, comfortable library 
armchairs where she saw some of her classmates snoozing.
	
When you prepare for tests, take your practice exams in a room 
arranged much like the testing room. So, although you might prefer 

106    C H A P T E R   7
to learn in a comfortable setting, at a large desk, or in the middle of 
your bed, you must be able to transfer this learning to the classroom 
and testing situation. This transfer will occur more easily if you give 
yourself practice exams in a room of similar design.
E X E R C I S E  7 - 7  	How Does Room Design Affect You? 
(Optional)
Briefly describe in what setting you learn and concentrate best.
Food Intake
Do you often have the “munchies” when you study and can’t con-
centrate unless you have something in your mouth? Or perhaps you 
must wait at least an hour or two after you eat before you can con-
centrate on learning anything.
	
You may have noticed certain foods affect your study capabilities 
more than others. Too much caffeine may make you nervous and jit-
tery, and a large fatty meal may dull your senses and make you feel 
exhausted and lethargic. A few ounces of protein eaten an hour or 
two before you study may help increase your alertness and motiva-
tion. An ounce or two of carbohydrate eaten before or while you study 
can calm you and increase your focus. Chapter 9 discusses some of 
the effects of food on the thinking process.

Enhance Your Learning Style   107
	
In the following space, briefly describe how food affects your ability to 
study math.
Mingle or Single
Are you a loner when you study or would you prefer studying with 
others? Having a “study buddy” can be an effective study tool. A 
study partner can also alleviate feelings of isolation or loneliness. 
For ideas on how best to benefit from studying with others, be sure 
to read the section “Study Buddies” in Chapter 9.
	
Some students like working in small groups with classmates and 
rave about their study group. Others have been disappointed with 
them. Still other students find studying a very private act. They pre-
fer no one to disturb them. They lock themselves away in a library 
cubicle or in their bedrooms.
	
I’ve also counseled students who prefer a combination of being 
alone and being with others. They like to study by themselves but 
with the hustle and bustle of activity and movement around them, 
as long as no one pays attention to them. These students often enjoy 
studying in a coffee shop or the school cafeteria. Many report they 
enjoy studying in their school math tutoring lab where they can be 
alone but where there are others who are also studying math and 
where tutors are available if needed.
Clothing
Do you prefer to wear loose, comfortable clothing when you learn 
math, or is this not an issue for you? In class and when taking tests, 
make sure you wear clothes that are as comfortable as the clothes in 
which you study. What are your favorite clothes for studying? What 
clothes make you feel successful and sure of yourself?

Summary
You can greatly enhance your ability to learn math if you remain 
aware of, and at times also manipulate, the factors that influence 
your unique learning style. In this section of our road map, we as-
sessed whether you are a visual, an auditory, or a kinesthetic/tactile 
learner, and I offered you learning strategies specifically adapted 
to your preferred perceptual learning style. We also explored the 
sequential and global learning styles, as well as the deductive and 
inductive learning styles. Then we examined how you are affected by 
time of day, sound, lighting, temperature, room design, food intake, 
social environment, and clothing.

Imagine for a moment you’re giving a surprise party for someone 
special. You’ve invited people you care about, and you want every-
thing to be perfect. Are the balloons inflated? Does the party table 
look just right? Are food and drinks set out? Are the flowers fresh? 
Has just the right music been selected? Don’t you think things are 
more likely to go well if these arrangements are in order? Prepara-
tions pay off. And if you want your journey toward your math goal to 
go smoothly, with less hassle, it’s absolutely crucial you set the stage 
for learning. How? By sharpening your math study skills.
	
Don’t shrug your shoulders. Math isn’t the same as other sub-
jects. Strategies to help you study and learn psychology, history, or 
English won’t necessarily help you with math. There are studying 
techniques that work best for math; master them and master good 
habits that breed success. Master them, and you will remember 
math concepts more easily, retain them longer, and use them more 
effectively.
	
This chapter explores these study-skills methods. I urge you to 
approach them seriously. They have already provided many math-
anxious students with major breakthroughs on their road to math 
success. Why not you? At times, these skills may seem disarmingly 
simple, but believe me, they are more powerful than you think! They 
are choice ingredients in your math mastery recipe. And remember, 
using good study techniques won’t necessarily mean you have to 
study more hours; it means you will study more efficiently and ob-
tain gratifying results.

Now let’s see what you can do to improve your math study skills.
How Do You Approach Learning?
One traditional approach to the learning process is the empty vessel 
model. In this model, the student considers his or her mind an empty 
container that the teacher is expected to fill with knowledge. If you 
adhere to this approach, you would expect to learn all there is to 
learn simply by attending class and opening your mind to the subject 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   113
matter, which then pours in. I am not a believer in this approach. My 
many years as a college counselor have shown me learning doesn’t 
happen passively.
	
We are very complicated beings, and we must understand our-
selves and how we learn best before we can reach out and tackle a 
subject. We must understand how we think, create, and retain new 
information. We must understand the memory process and strate-
gies that enhance recall. We must look at the uniqueness of our 
subject matter and identify how best to approach each new area of 
knowledge. This is the personal growth model of learning. The user-
friendly strategies described here are based on this approach.
Which Math Class to Take?
Let’s begin our discussion of math study skills with your plan to take 
a math class. This is a very important step, and you must execute 
it carefully. There are three aspects you should consider: (a) correct 
placement, (b) when you last took math, and (c) auditing or repeat-
ing a math course.
	
Correct placement in math is crucial. If you are put into a math 
course too advanced for your level of understanding, your anxiety 
level is sure to increase. The material will be over your head, and 
you will be doomed to failure. On the other hand, if you are put into 
a class below your math ability, you may get bored. Contrary to what 
you might think, when students are placed lower than their math 
ability level, they tend to do poorly in math and often stop coming 
to class or drop out. So being placed correctly is the key. If possible, 
take your school’s math placement exam or find a math teacher who 
can accurately assess your math skills and place you properly.
	
When did you last take math? I encourage people who are taking 
math never to skip a semester if they can help it because it’s easy 
to forget a lot fairly quickly. One study found that after 1 year of 
nonuse, students had lost approximately two-thirds of their elemen-
tary algebraic knowledge (Pauk & Owens, 2008). If you’ve been out 
of school for many years, you are sure to have forgotten much more 
of your math. A math placement exam could help you decide which 
math course to take.

114    C H A P T E R   8
	
As a rule of thumb, if you haven’t taken math in about 3 years, 
you probably will need to repeat the last math course you success-
fully completed. And think of successful completion as a grade C or 
better. In fact, research has indicated students are more likely to 
succeed as they go into higher and higher levels of math if they have 
no lower than a B in their algebra courses.
	
If you decide to repeat a course for credit and you receive a 
higher grade than you received before, most colleges will use only 
the higher grade in your grade point average (GPA) and eliminate 
the lower grade from your GPA. Find out how your school handles 
­repeats.
	
If, to freshen up your skills, you decide to repeat a course you 
have already taken, you may consider auditing the course so you 
don’t have to be concerned about the grade. But I urge you when 
auditing the course to come to class regularly, complete all the home-
work, and take all the tests. You will get the most out of the course 
this way, without having to worry about a grade. Auditing can be 
used in another way as well. If you plan to take a math course that 
you feel is a difficult one, you might audit it first and take it for cred-
it the following semester. The audit allows you to familiarize yourself 
with the material, and it gives you the opportunity to practice work-
ing out the math problems. However, don’t audit unless you plan to 
participate. 
	
Once you’ve chosen the correct math class, follow the exact math 
sequence recommended at your school. Do not skip over a course or 
skip a semester without taking math. Work sequentially until your 
math requirement is completed.
Schedule It Right
A truism for many students is: Learning math frequently and in 
small chunks is a formula for success. So how often your class meets 
each week is an important consideration. I urge you never to take 
a math class taught only once a week. Always choose a class that 
meets as many times a week as possible. For most three-credit 
courses, this usually means meeting three times a week during the 
regular semester, but I have seen some sections of college algebra, 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   115
trigonometry, or calculus held four or five times weekly. Remember, 
the more days a week, the better.
	
The time of day you take the class should also be carefully cho-
sen. Taking into account the chart you completed in Exercise 7-3, 
schedule your class for a time when you are most alert and able to 
learn. If you are not a morning person, don’t schedule yourself for 
early classes. This will not be productive and may create feelings of 
frustration and defeat.
	
Do not schedule anything during the hour following your math 
class. This will allow you time to review immediately after class, 
reinforcing the concepts you just learned. Equally important, it per-
mits you extra time should your exam run overtime. I’ve seen many 
math teachers allow students to continue working on exams even 
after the class period has ended. Why not give yourself as much time 
as possible?
Teacher Selection: Satisfaction Guaranteed
Once you have decided which math course you will register for, the 
next critical step is to choose a good math teacher. Spend time ask-
ing around about math teachers. Ask others why they like or dislike 
a certain teacher. Don’t choose a class just because it fits into your 
schedule well.
	
A great teacher can make all the difference in how you feel about 
going to class and how much you learn in class. Select a teacher who 
explains concepts well; teaches according to your learning style (see 
Chapter 7); welcomes questions before, during, and after class; has 
office hours for outside help; has a positive attitude toward students; 
and gives fair tests.
	
Unfortunately, in some schools, students are unable to choose 
their instructor before registering because the word staff and not 
the teacher’s name is listed in the class schedule. If you find yourself 
in this situation, you will need to determine within the “drop/add” 
­period (approximately the first 10 days of school) if your current 
math teacher is a person from whom you can comfortably learn. If 
you find yourself dissatisfied, switch quickly to another section with 
a more satisfactory instructor. Of course, before changing, check out 
your new teacher. It is up to you to select well.

116    C H A P T E R   8
	
We have all had teachers whom we remember fondly (or not so 
fondly) and whose image and manner are inexorably linked in our 
minds with the subject they taught. Some students actually are so 
put off by a teacher’s appearance or personality that they come to 
dislike the course and, by association, the subject matter also. By 
“losing the forest for the trees,” they sabotage their progress.
	
You may also want to know if your teacher teaches more than 
one section of the math course you plan to take; if you have to miss 
a class or if you haven’t quite gotten a certain concept in class, you 
could ask to sit in another section of the same course.
Give It Your All
Once you’ve chosen the appropriate course and the best teacher for 
you, you are ready to attend a math class. I encourage you to view 
the learning of math as a positive and rewarding academic challenge. 
Devote your energy to it. It requires persistence, concentration, dis-
cipline, patience, and lots and lots of practice. Don’t take math with 
other hard courses or a busy workload. Give yourself the time! Many 
teachers and students have learned the “rule” that you should study 
2 hours for every 1 hour you are in class. But this may have no basis 
in reality when it comes to math or any other difficult subject. Suc-
cessful math students usually study math for at least 2 hours every 
day throughout the semester. So don’t feel bad if you don’t assimilate 
math as fast as you think you should. Learning math takes time. Give 
yourself the time; nothing succeeds like excess!
Stay Current
It is most important to stay current in math. Don’t fall behind or the 
entire course will become an effort and a struggle for you. Success in 
math builds on existing knowledge at each stage. Be attuned to the 
cumulative nature of math. You can only understand new informa-
tion if you assimilate and digest earlier information. So keep up with 
the work and don’t fall behind; try not to miss important building 
blocks along the way.

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   117
Attend All Classes
Successful students are more likely to attend all classes, whereas 
failing students miss one-third or more of their classes. Don’t cut 
math class. Missing even one class may actually put you behind by 
at least two sessions because you may feel lost when you return to 
class the next session. If you have to miss, be sure to read the as-
signed text material thoroughly, do your homework, and get a copy 
of the class notes from a classmate. Go to your teacher to clear up 
anything you don’t understand.
Be Bold: Sit Near the Front
Successful students are also more likely to sit close to the front of 
the classroom and near the center. Be bold—boldness has genius. 
You are more likely to pay attention and concentrate on the lecture 
by sitting close to the front. It also helps you to be more involved in 
the class, to have more direct contact with the teacher, and to see the 
board more easily. Those students who sit in the back of the class are 
not only physically but also psychologically more distant from the 
lecturer. It is much easier to get distracted by sounds or side discus-
sions going on in the back of the room.
Take Class Notes
Your class notes and your text notes are like your bible in math. They 
indicate the essence of what you are learning. Studies show successful 
students take more class notes—about 64% of what is presented—
than unsuccessful ones. Write down what the teacher puts on the 
chalkboard and all verbal explanations that can clarify what you are 
learning. Write down important ideas, equations, examples, helpful 
hints, and suggestions. Strive to follow and understand the teacher’s 
reasoning and logic when solving a board problem. Note steps in a 
solution the instructor explains but doesn’t necessarily write on the 
board. Don’t be afraid to ask the instructor to repeat anything you 
miss or don’t understand. If your teacher explains examples directly 
from your math text, you needn’t write these down. Simply follow 

118    C H A P T E R   8
along in your text and add any clarifying statements. Make your notes 
legible, neat, and clear so you can read them easily.
	
Be an active listener. No teacher can speak or write as fast as we 
can think, so it is very easy to “tune out” during math class. I hear 
this from lots of students who have trouble concentrating in math 
class. They begin to daydream, or think about the chores they need 
to do or about a relationship they’re in, and pretty soon, they’ve lost 
the train of thought in the lecture. So be an active listener. Relate 
what is being taught to previous lectures, to the homework assigned, 
or to your textbook reading. Pose questions to keep up your interest 
and further your understanding.
	
Choose a large notebook with pockets you can use exclusively for 
math. In the front half of your notebook, write class notes, and in the 
back half, write textbook notes and the solutions for homework and 
sample practice problems. Use the pockets for handouts, syllabi, or 
returned test papers. Date each day’s class notes and identify the 
topic on top of the page in large writing. Leave plenty of space in 
your class notes for additional clarifications, diagrams, sketches, and 
comments you may want to add later. 
	
It’s an excellent idea to use your colored markers when you re-
view your class notes to identify definitions, theorems, proofs, for-
mulas, procedure steps, examples, or equations. If you clearly label 
your class notes, you will be more efficient in locating information to 
review and study for tests.
Questions That Count; Answers That Add Up
Always remember, you have the right to ask questions of your teach-
er before, during, and after class. See your instructor during office 
hours or visit the math learning center, if your school has one. No-
tice when you begin to fall behind and seek help immediately. Never 
avoid asking questions because you are afraid to look stupid. There 
is no such thing as a stupid question! 
	
Design questions for yourself when you read your chapter, when 
you do your homework assignments, and when the teacher is ex-
plaining concepts in class. If you have difficulty following a proce-
dure your instructor or a tutor is working out, ask questions about 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   119
each step you find confusing. Determine which procedural step first 
caused your difficulty. Then ask a question about this precise step. 
Rather than say, “I’m lost,” ask, “Could you please explain step 3?” 
or “I don’t understand step 3. Would you explain it a different way?” 
By being specific, you can pinpoint exactly where your difficulty be-
gan, and in turn, your instructor or the tutor can be more effective in 
helping you. They are more likely to avoid repeating information you 
already know and, instead, focus on your area of difficulty. So speak 
up, ask specific questions, and talk your way to success!
The Magic of “Now” Improves Memory
I’ve had many students come for counseling and tell me they un-
derstood the material presented in their math class, but when they 
looked at their notes and homework a day or two later, it was all 
“Greek.” They must then sit for hours reconstructing what it was 
their instructor taught a day or two earlier in class.
	
I have found the most important study skill math students can 
learn is to review immediately after learning and then again 8 hours 
later. This review directly after math class is critical. Reviews need 

120    C H A P T E R   8
only last 10 or 15 minutes because you already know the material. 
Cover your notes and repeat them to yourself in your own words 
or picture them in your mind. Cover up the solutions to problems 
worked out in class and see if you can work them out now. It is also 
important to do your homework the same day as your teacher as-
signs it. This acts as a review of what you just learned. Make a com-
mitment to yourself to review regularly throughout the semester.
	
Let me explain to you why it is so important to review immedi-
ately after learning. The German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus 
was the first person to do research on the rate of forgetting. He did 
his research with meaningless material known as nonsense syl-
lables. He found that, after 20 minutes, nearly half of what had been 
learned was forgotten, and after 1 day, nearly two-thirds were lost. 
Ebbinghaus also found that ­after 2 days, 69% was lost; in 15 days, 
75%; and in 31 days, 78%. This means that, after a month, you re-
member only 22% of the material you learned.
	
A classic study by H. F. Spitzer on the retention of meaningful 
material found results similar to Ebbinghaus’s study. Even with 
meaningful material, most forgetting takes place immediately af-
ter learning occurs. However, Spitzer showed that students who 
reviewed the material immediately after learning and then did pe-
riodic reviews were able to retain almost 80% of the material after 2 
months! Why this astonishing difference?
	
One reason reviewing immediately after learning is so effective is 
that it takes time for new information to be consolidated or convert-
ed into permanent or long-term memory. There is a reverberation 
circuit of neurons in the brain that helps in this process. If you stay 
with the material you just digested and review it immediately after 
learning, this circuit is repeatedly activated until your memory or 
neural trace is strengthened, forming long-term memory. Estimates 
indicate it takes between 4 seconds and 15 minutes for a memory 
trace to consolidate or jell in your mind. If you don’t review immedi-
ately after learning new material but instead jump to another sub-
ject, watch the news, or run off to another class (as with back-to-back 
classes), you prevent this memory trace from becoming established 
in your long-term memory. So stay with it; review soon after learn-
ing and often thereafter. You’ll find you will start to remember more. 
And because you know the material, you don’t have to spend hours 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   121
relearning it. This is the most efficient and effective way to learn 
math. So don’t delay; review your material promptly and capitalize 
on the magic of now!
The Birth of Excellence: Say and Do
In the personal growth approach, I encourage you to be fully in-
volved in the math learning process. This means use all your senses: 
Recite the material aloud; explain it to others; hear it; see it; write 
it down; work with it; manipulate it in as many ways as possible; 
work out as many problems as you can. This ensures that, if you 
can’t remember your material one way, you will another. If you use 
a variety of methods, you will also be reviewing your material and 
reinforcing your memory of it. This approach to learning is further 
substantiated by memory retention studies (as reported by Mag-
nesen, 1983) showing that students tend to remember a full 90% of 
what they “do and say.”
	
So jump right in and be involved! Make sure to take both class 
notes and reading notes. Taking notes is an active process, and the 
more involved you are in the learning process, the more you will 
learn. Also, as you read your math book, recite aloud in your own 
words what you are learning. This is an immediate review, and it 
will help consolidate the material in your memory.
	
If you sit in math class and take no notes or silently read your 
math book without reciting aloud or taking notes, you will remember 
very little after a few days. We remember only 10% of what we read 
and 20% of what we hear. But studies show students remember 70% 
of what they explain aloud to themselves or others. Furthermore, 
by involving all their senses, by both saying and doing (writing, ma-
nipulating the material, working out problems), students are able to 
remember an incredible 90% of the material learned.
	
When you go to a math tutor for help and the tutor explains the 
material to you, who is going to remember more, you or the tutor? 
The tutor, of course! If the tutor is “saying and doing,” the tutor’s 
abilities are sharpened. So if you go to a tutor for help, after the ma-
terial is explained and shown to you, say, “Now let me explain it to 
you and work out a different problem to see if I understand.”

122    C H A P T E R   8
Homework Hints
I mentioned earlier you should always strive to complete homework 
assignments the same day they are assigned to ensure your review 
takes place as soon after classroom learning as possible. Make sure 
to read your assignments before you tackle your homework. In an ef-
fort to save time, many students attempt to do their homework prob-
lems without reading about the topic. In the long run, this turns out 
to be a wasted effort because they miss essential details and must 
start all over. So be methodical. Work on all the problems you were 
assigned and even more. The more problems you work out, the more 
your confidence, competence, and speed in doing math will build. 
It may seem like a lot at first, but your increasing fluency and self-
esteem will reward you handsomely.
	
When you are doing your homework, it is okay to grapple or 
“wrestle” with it. Homework is intended to challenge your thinking 
and test your newly acquired knowledge. And remember, there isn’t 
only one right way to solve a problem. Try at least two or three ways. 
Determine for yourself which approach works best.
	
Devote either the latter half of your math notebook or a whole 
separate notebook to your homework. Carefully label and date each 
assignment and give yourself plenty of paper to work out each prob-
lem. Don’t cram your work on the page. By giving each problem ad-
equate space, your teacher or a tutor can help you locate mistakes 
more readily. It will also be easier for you to review your work later 
when you are studying for exams.
Visualize the Problems
Read each one of your homework problems carefully at least two 
or three times. Do you understand it? Can you state it in your own 
words? Determine what things are given, what the unknowns are, 
what relationships exist, and what the problem asks for. Write these 
down. Now ascertain how to achieve the results from what you al-
ready have. Look at other problems you’ve learned and see if the 
same procedures can be used. Try to locate simpler problems similar 
to this problem. Draw out the problem. Make tables, illustrations, 
diagrams, and so on. This will give you direction for your analysis 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   123
and computation. An illustration often can clarify the meaning of 
a difficult problem or formula. If you’re a visual learner, it will be a 
double bonus for you. Write the equations needed. Estimate the an-
swer and decide on the operations to be done. Then do the necessary 
manipulations, checking yourself step by step. Once you are finished, 
use any of the checking procedures described next. For more infor-
mation on problem solving, read the suggestions in Chapter 10.
The Ten Commandments of Work Checking
Many students lose a significant number of points on their home-
work problems and on tests because of errors in simple computa-
tions, not because of a lack of understanding. If you want to get the 
highest score possible, it is important you learn to check your work 
carefully. This process is similar to proofreading your essays in an 
English course. Get into the habit of checking all your homework 
problems as if you were taking a test. It will be good practice for the 
real thing. Use the following guidelines.
	
1. Does your answer make sense? Is it reasonable? Reread the prob-
lem to be sure you have approached it in a logical, systematic way.
	
2. Does your answer fit your estimate? When you work out prob-
lems, be sure to estimate the correct answers first. Estimate reason-
able upper and lower limits; in other words, find the range within 
which the answer should fall. Then work the problem out and see 
if the answer and the estimate are of about the same magnitude. If 
not, rework the problem in a different way to see if your new answer 
is close to the estimate.
	
3. Recalculate. Recheck your division by multiplying, your mul-
tiplication by dividing, your addition by adding the numbers in a 
different order, and your subtraction by adding. Many students 
make simple computational errors in these operations, leading to 
a significant point loss on exams. Others reverse or forget to carry 
numbers, forget the middle term when squaring binomials, or don’t 
do the same operation to both sides of an algebraic equation. If you 
use a calculator for these operations, make it a rule to calculate each 
operation twice. Always check and make sure you are using the right 
order of operations when solving algebraic equations. When factoring 

124    C H A P T E R   8
using exponents, are you applying exponents to all the factors? Have 
you multiplied the exponents when raising an exponential form to a 
power? When dealing with radicals, have you applied the radical to 
every factor inside the radical?
	
4. Do your problem twice. Some students find it helpful to com-
plete the problem and then to do it over again (using an alternative 
method, if possible) without looking at their previous solution. If the 
two answers are different, they know that one solution is definitely 
incorrect. At this point, they go over each step and carefully check for 
errors. Other students prefer to check for errors at each step along 
the way during problem solving.
	
5. Check your usage of signs. When you multiplied two negative 
numbers, did you get a positive one? Did you change a negative sign 
to a positive one when you switched it from one side of an equation 
to the other?
	
6. Check your decimal points. Did you put the decimal point in 
the right spot? If you estimated the correct answer, it will be easier 
to check if your decimal point is properly placed.
	
7. Recheck your writing. When you worked out problems on scrap 
paper, did you transfer them correctly to the answer sheet?
	
8. Check your exponents. Are you handling exponents correctly, 
multiplying, dividing, adding, or subtracting the necessary values?
	
9. Reread visuals. If you are required to read charts, tables, fig-
ures, or graphs, do you double-check everything you are looking for?
	
10. Substitute your answer. Does your answer satisfy the given 
conditions of the problem? After working out the problem, take the 
answer you got and substitute it for the unknown quantity in the 
problem. If it doesn’t fit, double-check your calculations or work it 
out a different way.
Practice, Practice, Practice
Nothing succeeds like excess. Work out lots and lots of sample prob-
lems: practice, practice, practice. Make problem solving a part of every 
study session. This is your most powerful aid to effective math learn-
ing. As a rule of thumb, work out at least ten problems per study ses-
sion and review at least five problems from previous study sessions. 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   125
Your proficiency in solving math problems increases with practice. 
Cover up the solutions for problems solved in your text and work out 
the problems yourself. Study math every day if possible or at least five 
times a week. The more you review and work out problems, the more 
you will learn and the more comfortable you will become.
Overlearn Your Math
Since math constantly builds upon itself, each successive layer of 
new information must rest firmly on previous layers. As you assimi-
late more and more math, you must firmly establish the principles 
and concepts you are learning so they will be solid supports for the 
knowledge yet to come. Overlearning is an important study skill to 
solidify your math building blocks.
	
Constantly test and retest yourself on the material you absorb. 
Learn to recognize your material no matter the order in which it is 
presented to you on a math test, no matter how difficult it may seem, 
and no matter how it may be “disguised.” When you study, don’t stop 
after you’ve just barely received the information. Apply the prin-
ciples you’ve learned in different situations; work out mountains of 
problems. Get to know the concepts inside and out. In addition, it’s 
important to review previous knowledge and topics you’ve learned. 
This will ensure prior building blocks remain firmly in place and 
don’t erode with the passage of time.
From Acquisition to Understanding
Researchers Cates and Rhymer have studied the relationship be-
tween math anxiety and performance (2003). They found that stu-
dents with high math anxiety levels aren’t less accurate than less 
anxious students when they solve math problems, but they tend to 
be less fluent or slower. They also found that math anxiety becomes 
more apparent when the math required multiple procedures to be 
carried out and when multiple digits were used.
	
Cates and Rhymer concluded that math anxiety is more related 
to higher levels of learning math than to the initial acquisition stage 

126    C H A P T E R   8
of learning. Their research implies that math anxious students are 
able to acquire new math concepts and use them accurately, but 
they do not necessarily master these concepts well enough to use 
them quickly and effortlessly, nor can they readily apply the newly 
acquired concepts to other similar problems or adapt the concepts to 
more difficult ones. 
	
Cates and Rhymer suggest students need to go beyond the initial 
acquisition learning stage to higher learning stages, such as those 
referred to by Haring and Eaton (1978) as the fluency stage, the 
generalization stage, and the adaptation stage. Skill in the last two 
stages reflects a higher level of understanding.
	
Let’s look at these learning stages for a moment. The first stage 
is the mere acquisition of information. Here the focus is to learn to 
be accurate in using the new information as measured by giving 
the correct answer to math questions using the concept, regardless 
of how much time it takes. Very often, students consider particular 
math concepts or skills learned when an accurate answer is given. 
Many math anxious students get stuck at this stage, and don’t go to 
the higher stages when learning to apply this concept. Do not allow 
this to happen to you. 
	
The second stage of learning is to achieve math fluency. This is 
the ability to perform a skill quickly, readily, and with little effort. To 
be fluent, time matters. Math anxious students often acquire basic 
math concepts and skills and use them correctly when given enough 
time. However, when the problems become more difficult and they 
must work faster, their anxiety gets in their way and performance 
suffers. I encourage you to learn your math skills so well through 
practice and through overlearning that you can go to the higher 
learning stages and, hence, increase your mathematical proficiency 
and performance.
	
The third stage of learning is the generalization stage. During 
this stage, students are capable of taking their learned math skills 
and using these skills in other similar situations. To be successful at 
this stage, take the math skills you have learned and practiced and 
solve as many similar problems as you can.
	
The fourth and last stage of learning is the adaptation stage. 
Here students are able to adapt or modify the skills they have 
learned to solve many different types of problems. For success at this 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   127
stage, I encourage you to apply what you have learned to a variety of 
more and more difficult problems. In this way, you will become more 
proficient in math, and your comfort level will as well.
	
Figure 8-1, Math Learning Stages and Strategies, summarizes 
the goals of each of the four learning stages and suggests strategies 
to be used at each stage.
Figure 8-1  Math Learning Stages and Strategies 
(Based on Haring & Eaton, 1978)
Learning Stage 
Acquisition
The goal of this stage is to be highly accurate 
when using newly learned math skills.
 
Fluency
The goal of this stage is to learn math skills 
well enough to respond accurately, quickly, 
and effortlessly, particularly when these skills 
must be combined with other math skills.
 
Generalization
The goal of this stage is to use the learned 
math skills in a variety of similar situations and 
to be able to distinguish when to use these 
skills as opposed to other similar skills.
 
Adaptation 
The goal of this stage is to adapt or modify 
relevant elements of previously learned math 
skills to solving new, challenging, and 
different types of math problems.
Suggested Strategies 
1. Work for accuracy when learning new math 
skills. 
2. Get immediate feedback on whether you 
are correct or not. 
3. Practice the new skill until you can correctly 
apply it.
1. Review and practice newly acquired math 
skills until you can use them rapidly, with 
accuracy, and without hesitancy.
2. Practice being able to rapidly use a 
combination of math skills when solving 
math problems. 
3. Give yourself time challenges, such as 
being able to solve ﬁve new problems in 5 
minutes. When this is accomplished, 
decrease the time allotted.
1. Practice the skill in a variety of similar 
problems.
2. Looking at a variety of math problems, 
distinguish between when these math skills 
are needed and when they are not. Then 
work the problems out using the skill.
1. Apply the math skills you have learned to 
more and more difﬁcult and challenging 
problems.
2. Continue to challenge yourself to solve 
more and more novel math problems. 
Determine which elements of the skills you 
have learned are needed to solve these 
problems. Then go ahead and solve the 
problems and check your answers for 
accuracy.

Using the chart you completed in Exercise 7-3, determine when your 
energy level is high and plan your study sessions accordingly. I call 
this “rolling with your alertness cycles.” However, many students 
put their math studying off until all their other work is completed, 
and by this time, they are often tired. This is like running up a down 
escalator with your arms full of books. You get exhausted and go no-
where fast! So be sure to study math before all your other subjects. 
By studying math first, when you’re most alert, you will be a more 
efficient learner. The concepts will come to you more readily.
Take Breaks
Many studies have shown the distinct benefits of distributed prac-
tice—short study sessions interspersed with rest breaks—over 
massed practice—one long, continuous session without a rest. In 
math, several short study sessions of intense work and concentration 
are much more effective than sitting for hours trying to figure out 
problems. I recommend you study for 20 to 40 minutes and then take 
a 5- to 10-minute study break. During your break, stand up, move 
around, stretch, get something to drink, and then return to your 
studying. After 2 hours, take a much longer break, perhaps 20 min-
utes. This regimen of short study periods with small breaks prevents 
mental, physical, and emotional fatigue and keeps your motivation 
high. You’ll find even during your short 5- to 10-minute breaks, your 
mind will be working on math, and when you come back to studying, 
your work will go more easily for you.
	
Ed and Nick, two brothers studying electronics, came for study-
skills help. They said they had studied electronics math for 5 hours 
together, and at the end of that time, they felt they knew less than 
they knew at the beginning of the session. I asked them to make only 
one change in their study habits. I still wanted them to study for 
5 hours but to spread their studying into five 1-hour study periods 
distributed over 2 days and to interrupt their 1-hour study periods 
with a 5- or 10-minute break every half-hour. A few weeks later, they 
reported that this made all the difference. Now they were learning 
and retaining everything they studied.

Stop Procrastinating: Do It Now!
Are you a motivation killer? Do you like to put off doing today what 
can be done tomorrow? If you tend to procrastinate and put off your 
math studying, it’s time to take super action. Super action is my 
four-part formula to overcome procrastination. Here’s how it works.
Part 1: Keep Taking Little Bites
Many students procrastinate because their math assignments seem 
too large, overwhelming, or complicated. To deal with this problem, I 
encourage you to dissect your studying into small “bite-size” pieces. 
This results in a series of subtasks. For example, you might decide to 
read your assignment in small sections or separate it into different 
topics, theorems, or formulas and then practice each separately.

130    C H A P T E R   8
	
Work on one subtask at a time. Arrange it so each task takes you 
only a short time to accomplish. If the assignment is particularly 
hard, spread the tasks out. Take lots of breaks between tasks or com-
plete them in more than one study session. You will accomplish quite 
a bit if you work on difficult assignments in small pieces or in short 
blocks of time. Your work will go much faster, and before you know 
it, the whole assignment will be completed.
	
Allen, a trigonometry student, found this technique really helped 
him to stop procrastinating on his math homework. He said he felt 
like a small mouse who was determined to finish a large hunk of 
delicious Swiss cheese. Bit by bit, piece by piece, he took lots of little 
bite-size pieces, and before he knew it, he got the whole job done.
Part 2: Reward Yourself for Good Study  
and Concentration
Set up a reward system for yourself. It can increase your motivation 
for studying math and help discourage procrastination. A principle 
we learn from behavior modification is that if a behavior is rewarded 
after it is performed, it is more likely to continue.
	
Many students feel their reward is the grade on the test for which 
they are studying, but this is not reinforcing enough for most stu-
dents. A test may or may not turn out the way you want it to. I believe 
more important than the grade on the test is the fact you have studied 
and concentrated well. So stop procrastination cold! Reward yourself 
when you accomplish what you’ve set out to accomplish.
Part 3: Use a Kitchen Timer
Did you ever imagine a simple kitchen timer could stop procrastina-
tion in its tracks? It works miracles for people who use one.
	
If you have trouble sitting down to study, set your kitchen timer 
for 15 minutes or half an hour depending on how you’re feeling. 
Make sure the timer is in a different room from where you are study-
ing. Now tell yourself: “I only have to study for this period of time. 
When the buzzer sounds, I’ll go and shut it off, and at that time, I’ll 
decide whether I will set the timer for another small block of time.” 
This puts studying totally in your control, and it forces you to move 
around and take small breaks. Even if you study for at least one 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   131
15-minute block, it’s a lot better than procrastinating all day. I’ve 
also found that once students study in little blocks of time, they be-
come involved in the material and often decide to reset the timer and 
study more. Try it—you might like it!
Part 4: Change Your Inner Self-Talk
Many procrastinators get stuck in negative, self-defeating self-talk. I 
urge you to tune into this inner dialogue so you can challenge it with 
super action self-talk. Here are examples of shifting this negative dia-
logue to action-oriented self-talk. After reading the eight examples of 
super action shifts in Exercise 8-2, add at least two of your own.

So make up your mind to get things done now! It’s a mental blue-
print for success, not just in math class but in every job or career. 
Employers love what super action accomplishes. It’s reinforcing, and 
you’ll get hooked on it, too.
Tackle Your Math Book
Paula, a young woman taking a developmental math course, came 
to me because she was struggling in the course. As we talked, Paula 
confided she had never read her math book. She said she depended 
on the teacher’s lectures to give her all the information she needed 
for the exam. What a major mistake! By not reading her math book, 
she missed crucial information highlighting what was being taught 
in class. The more ways you can be exposed to math—the more you 
read, the more problems you work out, the more you do—the more 
you’ll learn.
	
I also encourage you to read your textbook’s preface early in the 
semester. The preface provides an overview of what to expect in your 
course as well as insights into the textbook author’s approach.
Read the Chapter Before and After Class
Make it a practice to read over the assigned chapter before you at-
tend math class. Many students avoid reading their math book or 
wait until after they’ve heard their instructor’s explanation before 
they read their assignment. If you are one of these students, take 
heed: Read your chapter prior to class even if you have little under-
standing of it. Look over the topics, diagrams, charts, terminology, 
formulas, and examples. This familiarizes you with the topics your 
teacher will present in class, and it prepares you to understand and 
absorb the material presented in class more readily. Pose questions 
on any confusing or difficult ideas in the chapter that can be an-
swered in class, and then listen carefully to your teacher’s explana-
tion. You’ll find you become a better listener, and you’ll learn much 
more from the class than previously. After attending class, first read 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   133
your math assignment in depth, and then do your homework prob-
lems. This will further your understanding of the math topics dis-
cussed in class and will also be an excellent ­review.
How to Read Your Math Text
Math reading assignments need to be tackled at least three times. 
Before you panic, let me explain; it’s amazingly simple and straight-
forward. First, survey your assigned material. When you survey, 
read the lead paragraphs, the first sentence of each paragraph 
throughout the section, and the closing or summary paragraphs. 
Read all highlighted areas, tips, subtitles, illustrations, charts, and 
graphs. This will give you a basic idea of what the section is about. 
As you do this, pose questions you believe your text material at-
tempts to answer or you believe might be answered in your math 
class. Be sure to complete this survey before you go to class.
	
Your second reading is your in-depth one, when you’ll read for 
mastery, reread sections for understanding, and mark and underline 
in your book. Have you noticed reading your math book is quite dif-
ferent from reading texts in psychology, the humanities, English, or 
anthropology? In these other areas, as much as 80% of the actual 
words are unimportant, except for the fact they are needed to link 
relevant ideas together. When you read math, every word is impor-
tant. Math books are usually written succinctly and to the point. 
Each word is carefully chosen to explain a concept. You need to read 
a math text slowly, carefully, and with good concentration. Don’t 
rush. Work on grasping each concept before going on. Learning math 
takes time. Reread the concepts, several times if necessary, until you 
gain mastery. If, after several attempts, you still can’t understand a 
particular sentence, review the topic up to this point and then reread 
the sentence. You also can formulate questions on these difficult 
points that you can later ask your instructor or a math tutor or look 
up in other math texts.
	
In other subjects, you may be able to jump around in your text, 
skip chapters, or read only parts of chapters and still understand 
the material. In math, each idea builds upon another; each topic 
presented assumes you’ve mastered previous topics. You can’t jump 

134    C H A P T E R   8
into the middle of a chapter or skip a few chapters and expect things 
to make sense. So move progressively in your math text from front to 
back, mastering topic by topic.
	
A picture says a thousand words—as do diagrams, charts, il-
lustrations, and figures. Don’t skip over them. Work to comprehend 
what they are illustrating.
	
Write and recite as you read. Some students hesitate to write in 
their math books which, they fear, would then lose resale value. But 
many bookstores don’t care if the books contain handwritten notes 
or underlining, and you could always do this in pencil. Let me as-
sure you, the best math students always mark their texts! Writing 
as you read gets you more involved in the reading process. Remem-
ber: We retain only 10% of what we read but 90% of what we say 
and do. Make notes to yourself directly in your text. Whenever you 
encounter new symbols or terms, look up their meaning and write 
them down in the margin. It’s important for you to know your math 
terminology. Label or mark in the margin important ideas, formulas, 
and procedures. Underline main points. Write out questions you 
have about the material. Cover up important topics and then explain 
them aloud in your own words to yourself or to someone else. Keep 
testing and retesting your understanding and retention of each topic 
as you read. View your text as one of the main sources for the types 
of questions you are likely to have on your math exam.
	
Examples are an integral part of a math assignment. Go over the 
steps methodically until you understand the terms used and be sure 
to follow the reasoning used for each procedure. Afterward, cover up 
the solutions and visualize, say aloud, or carefully work each prob-
lem out step by step, by yourself, to see if you conceptualize the pro-
cedures. When you finish, compare your steps to the sample steps in 
the text. Design other little tasks for yourself as you read. Work out 
all proofs and derivations. Work out as many problems as you can 
to ensure you assimilate the topics being presented. You will find it 
easier to learn facts when you comprehend them rather than follow 
them by rote.
	
The third reading of your chapter is for review and taking notes. 
Write down all important ideas, facts, equations, theorems, exam-
ples, and summaries in your notebook or on index cards. Work out 
your homework problems and do lots of practice problems.

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   135
	
Don’t feel overwhelmed! When you learn to drive, there’s a lot to 
attend to and some bumps along the way. But practice brings famil-
iarity, then a sure touch, next comfort with increased speed and pre-
cise handling, and then smooth sailing. The same will happen with 
math.
Keep a Math Terms and New Ideas Log
A log is a great place to document and reinforce new knowledge. You 
can keep the log in a separate section of your math or homework 
notebook. Label one section “Math Terms” and another “New Ideas.”
	
Each time you learn a new math term, enter the term and defi-
nition in your log. In many ways, learning math is like learning a 
new language. In fact, it’s been claimed that beginning algebra has 
more new terms than first-year French. As in learning any foreign 
language, once you know the meaning of the words, learning comes 
more easily. So starting today, build your math vocabulary.
	
In your log’s “New Ideas” section, define, in your own words, each 
new idea you learn. By putting the idea in your own words, it truly 
becomes yours. This is part of “doing” and “saying.” This is also be-
ing an active participant in the learning process. Your log documents 
what you have learned. By reviewing it often, you will also reinforce 
your new knowledge. As your log grows larger, you can be proud of 
your progress.
Flashcards for Quick Recall
Many students find 3″ × 5″ cards very practical for reviewing or 
committing to memory important bits of information. The cards are 
handy, cheap, and can be carried around conveniently. While at a 
stoplight, waiting for a bus, or between classes, students test them-
selves on their homemade flashcards. This practice helps them to 
review often and to spread learning out. Both are good learning prin-
ciples. Students using 3″ × 5″ cards report they are able to quickly 
memorize rules and principles without having to sit at a desk for 
hours studying and drilling themselves.

136    C H A P T E R   8
	
To memorize a rule or principle, make sure you completely un-
derstand every part of it. Then write a sample equation to show how 
it’s used, or illustrate what it represents with a picture. Once you’ve 
done this, read the definition aloud about five times, in your own 
words if possible. Then write the definition on a 3″ × 5″ card so you 
can review it often.
	
Use 3″ × 5″ flashcards to study math’s own unique vocabulary. 
You also can use flashcards for new facts, formulas, properties, 
proofs, or procedures you wish to recall quickly. Make sure you un-
derstand and know how to use all of these before you commit them 
to memory. If you understand the concepts behind the formulas and 
various procedures, you will be able to re-create them easily should 
your recall falter. A word to the wise: Sometimes you may have to 
commit to memory an extremely difficult concept you do not under-
stand. Don’t be discouraged. This even happens to students in ad-
vanced math courses. Your understanding may come later by asking 
questions of your instructor or tutor, looking in other texts, and in 
some cases, only by taking more advanced math courses.
Use Additional Resource Materials
Whenever possible, use the additional resource materials provided 
by the publisher of your math book. These resources are integrated 
with the topics presented in your textbook so you can easily locate 
the concept you are studying and needn’t search around.
	
Be sure to buy your textbook’s student study guide. The study 
guide will provide you with lots of problems on the concepts you are 
learning. If the publisher also provides CDs, videos, or a Web site, 
check them out.
	
It is also very helpful to use two or more math textbooks when 
studying. They provide you with many more worked-out problems to 
study as well as numerous sample problems to work out. Make sure 
you have the answers listed in the back of the book or in a solutions 
manual. In addition, by having more math books to study from, you 
have different explanations for the concepts you’re learning. Remem-
ber, your instructor has probably studied or taught out of several 

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   137
books and will be using this knowledge to teach the course and test 
you. You also might choose books that appeal to your perceptual 
learning channels. For example, if you’re a visual learner, you might 
choose texts with colored diagrams, illustrations, or charts. If you’re 
a verbal learner, you might prefer a book with more explanations, 
and if you’re a kinesthetic/tactile learner, you might search for texts 
with real-life examples with which you can experiment.
	
Elena, a college algebra student, said when she studied, she 
spread out four algebra books around her, and it felt as if she had 
four different teachers explaining algebra to her.
	
By having several different books, you can get an understanding 
of the topics you are studying from many different viewpoints. And if 
your text doesn’t quite make sense to you, another might explain the 
topic more understandably. In addition, by working with different 
textbooks, you review a topic each time you read about it. Some stu-
dents find books like the Schaum Outline Series useful for obtaining 
a large collection of sample problems and answers.
Get Help Fast
Don’t delay. If you need assistance, seek it immediately. Procrastina-
tion is a student’s greatest enemy. As soon as you have difficulty with 
a new concept or problem, get help. Set up a help session with a tu-
tor or a teacher. Never let yourself perpetuate inaccurate procedures 
or incorrect problem-solving processes.
	
Here are some suggestions on how to benefit most from a help or 
tutoring session:
	
1.	 Prepare for the help session by writing, ahead of time, specific 
questions to ask during the session.
	
2.	 After your tutor or teacher explains a new or difficult concept, 
repeat it in your own words to see if you understand it and to 
reinforce or strengthen long-term memory.
	
3.	 After the tutor or teacher shows you how to solve a problem, 
you, in turn, should work out several similar problems. Each 
time you believe you understand a new or difficult math con-
cept, demonstrate to the tutor or teacher your newly obtained 

138    C H A P T E R   8
knowledge. You, and not the tutor, must always be the one 
to “say and do.” This will ensure understanding and easy 
­recall.
	
4.	 After the help session, reinforce what you have learned by do-
ing lots and lots of practice problems.
	
In addition to getting help from your teacher or a tutor, you 
might check the Internet. There are several tutorial services and 
math help Web sites. One of my favorite Web sites is Ask Dr. Math. 
This is a wonderful Drexel University School of Education Web site 
where you can ask math questions. Over 300 volunteer “Math Doc-
tors” from all over the world answer questions posed to them by stu-
dents. Answers are sent back by e-mail. You can find Ask Dr. Math 
at http://mathforum.org/dr.math.
Study Buddies
Studying with a friend or in a group can be both fun and beneficial. 
Partners can help you learn new material, reinforce difficult con-
cepts, test your knowledge, challenge your thinking, identify areas 
of weakness, give you emotional support, and reduce the feeling of 
isolation when studying.
	
The best way to benefit from studying with others is to:
	
1.	 Choose a partner or friends who are serious about learning 
math.
	
2.	 Set a regular time each week to study, preferably at least 
twice a week for about 1 hour.
	
3.	 Study in an area where you will not be interrupted or dis-
tracted by others.
	
4.	 Have a chalkboard or large pad available to work out 
­problems.
	
5.	 Spend most of the time working out problems and explaining 
to your partner(s) how you solved the problem.
	
6.	 Always be a critical thinker, carefully evaluating, analyzing, 
and critiquing your work together.
	
7.	 Be honest with your partner when you don’t understand a 
concept.

Effective Math Study Skills: The Fuel of Excellence   139
	
8.	 Test each other often, especially on all new and/or difficult 
concepts.
	
9.	 Don’t allow yourselves to get stuck on any one problem. 
Mark it so one of you can ask your teacher or a tutor for help 
with it.
	
10.	 Stay positive and supportive of each other.
	
11.	 Spend only the first 5 or 10 minutes for socialization and 
then get down to work. Focus and concentrate your efforts on 
the concepts to be learned and reviewed.
	
12.	 Work out lots of practice problems.
	
13.	 When you are dealing with a difficult concept, make sure 
each of you can explain it to the other.
	
14.	 Have fun!
	
Important words of caution: Avoid studying with others who put 
you down or make you feel dumb or stupid. This will have a detrimen-
tal effect on your learning. Also do not study with others who aren’t 
serious about learning, want only to socialize, complain continuously 
about math, have such poor math skills they can’t challenge your 
thinking, or stand you up and don’t show up for scheduled meetings. 
When in a study group, avoid “groupthink,” or the tendency of group 
members to maintain group agreement, even at the cost of critical 
thinking. If you think something is wrong, speak up, check it out, ask 
your teacher or tutor for help. Don’t perpetuate false thinking.
Clear the Minefield
Without realizing it, you may be setting up a minefield for your-
self. This minefield is booby trapped with faulty beliefs about your 
own study process. For example, you might tell yourself: “There’s 
too much math to study and not enough time”; “I just can’t get the 
concepts and formulas to sink in”; “This material is so confusing; 
I haven’t a clue as to where to begin”; “There’s just too much to 
­remember”; or “I understood this math procedure in class, but now I 
have no idea how to use it.”
	
These are just a few examples of booby traps you can unwittingly 
set for yourself. These traps are a prescription for disaster. They can 

140    C H A P T E R   8
undermine your studying, hamper your progression, and increase 
your anxiety level. If you have the belief that cramming before a 
math test keeps the material fresh in your mind, you may end up not 
giving yourself enough time to understand your material or to prac-
tice your newly learned skills. Alternatively, if you believe you have 
too much to study and not enough time to get it done, or there’s sim-
ply too much to remember, your anxiety level might skyrocket, and 
you may be paralyzed into inactivity. Each mine or faulty belief in 
your minefield can stop you in your tracks, take you out of the action, 
The Mines (faulty beliefs)
There’s too much math to 
study and not enough time.
I’ve studied and under-
stood my math, but I just 
can’t get it to sink in. 
This material is so 
confusing; I haven’t a clue 
as to where to begin.
This material just puts me 
to sleep.
I understood this math 
procedure (or concept) in 
class, but now I have no 
idea how to use it.
Some Suggestions for Disarming Mines 
1. Ask your teacher to identify the most important concepts on 
which to focus your studying.
2. Begin studying early and give yourself lots of time.
3. Skim over your class notes and your textbook chapter. Get an 
overview of what the material covers. Study the charts, ﬁgures, 
examples, and formulas.
4. Identify the major topics on which you need to focus and then 
divide your workload into small, manageable areas.
1. Associate the new concepts to math concepts you already 
know. Determine how similar or different they are from the 
previous ones.
2. Practice using the new concepts and procedures in all types 
of problems.
3. Keep testing and retesting yourself. Get immediate feedback 
on whether you were correct. Then analyze where your errors 
are so you can correct them with further practice.
1. Identify all the key concepts and procedures you need to 
study.
2. Prioritize the most important areas on which you need to 
concentrate. Begin working on these areas ﬁrst.
1. Study with a partner or a study group. Give each other 
challenging practice tests to make sure you know the material.
2. Find other books that explain the material in a more inviting 
way.
3. Start studying math early in the evening, before other subjects.
1. Review and practice the math procedure (or concept) 
immediately after class and again later that day and later that 
week.
2. Practice using the procedure (or concept) with many different 
math problems.

Helpful Strategies for Dealing with Dyscalculia
If you’re experiencing dyscalculia (see discussion in Chapter 2) 
many of the strategies discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 
7, Enhance Your Learning Style, will be beneficial. Also, check 
out The Learning Disabilities Association of America’s Web site,  
Figure 8-2  (continued)
The Mines (faulty beliefs)
I can’t remember all this 
stuff; it’s just too much.
I think I might know this 
math concept well enough 
to be tested on it.
Math goes in one ear and 
out the other. 
I’ll just cram before the 
test, and then the material 
will be fresh. 
Some Suggestions for Disarming Mines 
1. Write summary sheets or ﬂashcards of the important proce-
dures and formulas or put them on handheld computers. 
Carry them around with you and test yourself often.
2. Use lists, charts, or diagrams to help you best organize the 
material you want to remember in a way to readily retrieve it 
when you need it. 
3. Create your own creative mnemonics (memory aids) like a 
rhyme or phrase to help you associate the concepts with 
something you already know. The gooﬁer or funnier the 
mnemonics, the better you will remember the material. 
1. Be sure to test yourself with many different examples to see if 
you truly understand the math concept. 
2. Test and retest yourself until you’re absolutely sure you know 
the concept.
1. Push distracting thoughts out of your mind so you can focus 
on learning your math.
2. After reading about a new math concept, see if you can 
explain it in your own words. Then practice applying it in 
solving problems.
3. Get help from a tutor when learning new math concepts. Ask 
lots and lots of questions to keep you focused and on track.
4. Set up a reward schedule for yourself. For example, give 
yourself a small reward for every half-hour of good math 
studying you accomplish.
1. Start studying and reviewing for an exam 1 or 2 weeks ahead.
2. Spaced learning increases retention and recall. Study in small 
chunks of time in the weeks before the exam.
3. Be rested and relaxed before an exam. Get a good night’s 
sleep. Avoid being physically and mentally exhausted.

www.ldanatl.org, which offers some excellent ideas. It suggests you 
use colored ­pencils to differentiate different types of problems; draw 
pictures when working out word problems; use diagrams to increase 
your understanding of math concepts; devise mnemonic devices to 
learn steps in a procedure; use your fingers, scratch paper, or graph 
paper; or listen to music and, in particular, rhythms to help you 
learn math facts.
	
If you have difficulty dealing with math sequences, as some 
people with dyscalculia do, it is helpful to visualize the steps in a 
procedure. Picture, in your mind, the numbers, the formulas, and 
the operations you must undertake. Picturing the sequences allows 
you to keep things in the correct order. When you solve a problem, 
you usually have to do the steps in a specific sequence to achieve the 
correct answer. 
	
It is also useful to draw flow charts or diagrams to help visualize 
sequences of steps. Try using colored pens or markers to highlight 
various parts of a problem or a procedure. Some students find us-
ing graph paper or spreadsheets along with colored writing utensils 
helpful to map out their work or to organize their ideas on paper. 
When working with multistep problems, divide them into finer and 
more manageable steps.
	
When learning a new math skill, flashcards often help. Be sure 
to study several concrete examples of how the skill is applied. Then 
gradually move from the concrete to more complex and abstract ways 
to apply the information. This will help you understand how to use 
the concept and not merely memorize it. Practice how to estimate 
the answer of each new problem before you solve it.
	
Also, when you study your math, think of it as a second language. 
Write down and define new terms and symbols. Study math termi-
nology. Knowing the language of math and the meaning of each term 
will take the mystery out of the terms being used.
	
Some people with dyscalculia get distracted easily. If this hap-
pens to you, make sure to study in a place free from visual and audi-
tory distractions. You want to keep your focus only on the math at 
hand. You can also use a line reader to help you stay on track and 
distinguish one line of a math problem from another.
	
Figure 8-3 offers some suggested strategies to deal with several 
dyscalculia difficulties experienced by students.

Divide the procedure into ﬁner steps and work out 
each step before going on; use colored pencils to 
differentiate between parts of the procedure
Apply the concepts in many examples from very 
concrete ones to more and more complex, abstract 
ones
Write down new math terms and symbols and 
deﬁne them and study them
Draw pictures, tables, or diagrams to picture what 
the problem is asking for; estimate your answer 
beforehand and plug the answer into the problem 
to see if it makes sense
Study in a place free from all distractions; use a 
line reader to distinguish one line of a problem from 
another

Summary
Use appropriate math study skills and you’ll achieve major break-
throughs on your road to success. This section of our road map 
highlighted strategies for obtaining greater mastery and retention 
of mathematical concepts. I encouraged you to jump right in and get 
actively involved in the study process; to carefully select your math 
class and your teacher; to go to class regularly; to take complete 
class notes; to stay current and not fall behind; to take the initiative 
to ask questions; to review immediately after learning and again 8 
hours later; to tackle your math reading assignments in three dif-
ferent ways; to work out lots and lots of practice problems every day; 
to keep a math terms and new ideas log; to use flashcards; to study 
with a buddy; and to clear your minefield of faulty study beliefs. I 
provided helpful strategies for dealing with dyscalculia. I encouraged 
you to go beyond mere acquisition of math concepts to math fluency, 
generalization, and adaptation.

Too many students experience test anxiety. Fear and overwhelming 
doom come over them like an impending, life-threatening storm. 
Darkness fills the horizon, and they shudder in their footsteps, para-
lyzed, unable to take any action. Thoughts race from one thing to 
another and, suddenly, blankness, emptiness, all they knew—gone! 
An empty slate with no numbers, no formulas, nothing. Foreboding 
images of agony or sudden death loom heavy in the air. Dreams and 
ambitions melt into oblivion. Feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, 
and hopelessness abound. Has this ever happened to you? If so, you 
are not alone. Each day, thousands face the devastating effects of 
test panic.
	
The symptoms of test anxiety may be as pervasive as those just 
described or as minimal as forgetting an easy formula you’ve used 
hundreds of times. Either way, your ability to perform well on math 
exams becomes terribly hampered. In some cases, you may become 
totally immobilized.

Kirk, a college freshman, came to me and pleaded: “Why me? I 
studied and studied. I knew my information, but I just blew it. I feel 
so dumb. I confused formulas, multiplied 2 × 4 and got 9, and on top of 
it all, copied answers incorrectly to the answer sheet.” Why, indeed?
	
The roots of test anxiety are threefold, and any or all may be the 
culprit. They include poor test preparation and test-taking strategies, 
psychological pressures, and poor health habits. In this section of our 
road map, we explore how to deal with each of these troublemakers.
Test Preparation and Test-Taking Strategies
Many students feel anxiety about taking math exams because they 
have poor study skills and inadequate test-taking strategies. The 
previous chapter discussed effective math study skills. Good skills 
are essential for comprehensive and long-term recall in math. In 
addition, specific test preparation and test-taking strategies make a 
world of difference. They help relieve pretest jitters and insecurities. 

Conquer Test Anxiety   147
	
Here are some important strategies I recommend to students.
	
1. When a test is announced, check in advance its format and 
content. Know what your instructor expects. Make a detailed list of 
all the topics the test will cover. Be sure to find out how many ques-
tions it will include and the time allowed. Will you need a calculator, 
charts, tables, or scrap paper? For example, Kamala learned her sta-
tistics final was going to include 60 questions, and she would have 3 
hours to complete the exam. Each question would have equal point 
value, so she’d have 3 minutes to answer each question. She learned 
even if some of her answers were wrong, she could get partial credit 
if she showed her work. She found out what six major topics the 
exam would cover. She’d be allowed to bring lots of scrap paper and 
her calculator. Statistical tables would be provided for all students.
E X E R C I S E  9 - 2  	Your Next Math Exam
Can you answer each of the following questions about your next math test?
	1.	 How many questions will be on the test?
	2.	 How much time will be allowed?
	3.	 Will each question have the same point value?
	4.	 What topics will be covered in the exam?
	5.	 Can you bring a calculator, scrap paper, or other aids?
	
2. Review each concept the exam will cover. Locate problems illus-
trating these concepts. Learn how to recognize these problems when 
they’re placed in random order, are worded differently, or the con-
cepts appear disguised. Solve lots of difficult problems on each topic 
to be tested. Work on gaining mastery of each math concept you’re 
studying. Reexamine all procedural steps used to solve specific types of 
problems. For example, if you will be asked to solve quadratic equations, 
plan to review the steps needed to solve these problems: simplify, write 
in a standardized format, factor (and if not factorable, use the quadratic 
formula), set factors equal to zero, and then solve the resulting equations. 
	
I encourage you to know your information inside and out so you 
can practically do it in your sleep. Then, no matter how the informa-
tion is presented on the exam, it won’t throw you, and you’ll recog-
nize it no matter how it’s camouflaged.

148    C H A P T E R   9
	
3. After completing your review, design your own sample practice 
exams covering each topic you’ve mastered. Choose questions from 
your text, other math texts, tests from past semesters, study guides, 
math software, or college outlines series books. Make sure that you 
have available to you the correct answers for these questions. Plan 
practice exams that include the same number and type of questions 
as your test. Design your practice exams carefully so they accurately 
reflect what has been done in class, what your teacher expects, and 
areas in which you may need more work.
	
4. Set a time limit for your practice exam, giving yourself the same 
amount of time allowed for the test. Then take several timed practice 
exams. Time yourself with a kitchen timer or an alarm clock. Many 
students can figure out all sorts of complicated problems if given 
enough time, but then they panic under the test’s time pressures. So 
be sure to set up your own timed exams. And practice, practice, prac-
tice. Work on building up speed and accuracy. If possible, take these 
practice exams in a room similar to the testing room.
	
This type of test preparation is great at relieving the stress of the 
real test and prevents panic. When you finally do take your exam, 
you can say, “What’s the big deal? I know I understand my work. It’s 
just another day and another test. I’ve already tested myself a zillion 
times. I’m ready—sock it to me!”
E X E R C I S E  9 - 3  	Design Practice Math Exams
	1.	 List the sources you will use to get sample problems.
	2.	 How will you get the correct answers to each problem you select?
	3.	 How many questions are you going to include in your practice exams?
	4.	 How much time will you allow yourself to complete each question?
	5.	 Where will you take your practice exams?
	
5. Use your practice exams to begin to recognize problems out  
of the context of your textbook or class notes. Note the types of ques-

Conquer Test Anxiety   149
tions causing you difficulty. Give yourself more practice in these 
areas. Ask your teacher for further help or go to tutorial or help  
sessions.
	
6. Use your practice exams to analyze what typical errors you are 
making. Identify whether there’s any pattern to the errors. For ex-
ample, do you consistently use one of your formulas incorrectly, or do 
you forget to carry numbers during calculations? Maybe you put the 
decimal point in the wrong place, or use signs incorrectly, or reverse 
numbers when recopying them. Perhaps you multiply instead of add 
exponents when multiplying exponential forms with like bases, or 
maybe you confuse the order of operations when solving algebraic 
problems. Make a list of these errors. Your list will be very important 
later when proofreading your math test.
E X E R C I S E  9 - 4  	Your Typical Math Errors
Do an error analysis. Look over your past math exams and your practice 
exams and list the typical careless errors you have made.
	
7. Get plenty of sleep in the 48 hours prior to your exam and eat 
healthy meals (see the next section on preperformance health tips). 
Make sure to practice deep breathing techniques in the half-hour be-
fore the exam. Arrive at the exam just on time and discuss the exam 
with no one. This avoids “catching” others’ preexam jitters.
	
8. As soon as you receive your math exam, write on the top corner 
of the exam paper all the formulas, rules, and key information you’ll 
need, including the simplest ones. Do this first, before beginning 
your math exam. This way, you’ll have a handy reference guide—
your “cheat sheet”—in front of you, and you won’t have to keep it 
stored in your head. Most students find this to be a very helpful tech-
nique that allows the exam to go smoothly.

150    C H A P T E R   9
E X E R C I S E  9 - 5  	Your Math “Cheat Sheet” (Optional)
List all the formulas, rules, principles, and key ideas you will need to re-
member for your next math exam.
	
9. Note the time limit and the point values for each question, par-
ticularly those that carry more value. Adjust your time accordingly, 
allowing more time for questions with higher point values.
	
10. Circle or underline significant words in each problem. Read 
and reread each problem slowly and carefully so you don’t misinter-
pret anything.
	
11. Start the math test with the easiest problems first. These may 
not necessarily be the first ones on the test. Do whichever ones come 
easily for you. You need not go in order. Then go to the next easiest, 
then the next easiest, working your way on up to the more difficult 
ones as your confidence level increases. This strategy reduces anxi-
ety and gives you feelings of success.
	
12. Don’t spend too much time on any one problem. Skip the 
harder ones, but mark them so you can find them readily. Return 
to these difficult questions later as your confidence builds. Also, be 
careful not to get stuck for a long time trying to remember a step on 
any one problem, even if it seems easy. Don’t allow yourself to lose 
too much valuable time on any individual problem that would pre-
vent you from completing the exam. Go on and the key step you are 
trying to remember will probably come to you later.
	
13. Throughout the exam, focus on remaining calm, relaxed, and 
positive. Check your breathing often; keep it regular and slow. Check 
your neck and shoulder muscles and loosen tight areas. Say positive 
statements to yourself and push away any disturbing or distracting 
thoughts.
	
14. If you can use calculators, take advantage of them. Learn how 
to use them well ahead of time. There are appropriate and inappro-
priate times to use them. They can be very useful for checking your 
answers.

Conquer Test Anxiety   151
	
15. When working on a difficult problem, write down whatever 
you know. This often helps in solving the problem. Some teachers give 
partial credit in recognition of what you know. Don’t skip a question if 
you know even a little. The answer might come to you as you work on 
it. But save these more difficult questions until the end of your test.
	
16. Take the entire test period to finish the exam. Don’t allow 
yourself to get nervous when some students leave early. Teachers 
have found math students who leave the earliest are often the ones 
who do poorly.
	
17. After finishing the test, use the remaining time to verify your 
solutions. First, you should check for reasonableness. Ask yourself: 
Does the number fit? Does the answer make sense? For example, can 
Marvin’s little sister really weigh 658 pounds? Or did Martha real-
istically spend $12,490.00 on a week’s worth of groceries? Second, 
check the specifics of the problem. Have you satisfied all the condi-
tions? If you are unsure of your answer, do it again. Use the ten com-
mandments of work checking described in Chapter 8.
	
18. Proofread your test. Did you answer all the questions? Are 
there any parts you missed? Look for omissions. Check to see if 
you’ve made any typical errors or pattern of errors you identified 
previously (see Exercise 9-4).
	
19. Leave and reward yourself for a job well done!
Deal with Psychological Pressures
Psychological factors contribute dramatically to test anxiety. Stu-
dents often talk negatively to themselves, put themselves down, and 
experience low self-esteem. No wonder they feel ill-equipped to con-
front difficult, high-stress situations. Whether realistic or not, some 
students create high expectations for themselves and fear failure or 
poor grades will jeopardize their entire future. Family members or 
loved ones, often unintentionally, may add to this burden with exces-
sive demands to do well. Encumbered by enormous self-imposed and 
externally imposed pressures to succeed, students are likely to panic 
at the thought of what might happen if they don’t.
	
Michael was one such student. He gave up his well-paying elec-
tronics job to return to school and finish the engineering degree he 

152    C H A P T E R   9
had started 12 years earlier. His wife became the sole breadwinner, 
supporting him and their three children. Everyone, including Mi-
chael’s parents, was excited for him and expected him to be a great 
success. But after three semesters in school, Michael became very 
discouraged. He was repeating one of his math courses for the third 
time. It was at this time he came to me for counseling. He had just 
panicked on an important exam and failed it. Michael appeared to be 
an intelligent, well-prepared, mature student, but his anxiety level 
had skyrocketed. He felt like a failure. He was sure he was letting 
down his family.
	
Research shows performance is a sensitive barometer to the level 
of anxiety students experience, though the relationship between 
performance and anxiety is not linear. You may be surprised to learn 
the effects of anxiety are not uniformly negative. In fact, research 
repeatedly finds some anxiety is necessary for optimal performance. 
When plotted in the form of a graph, the anxiety/performance curve 
takes the shape of an upside-down U (see Figure 9-1). If students feel 
low anxiety, they are inadequately motivated, accomplish little, and 
perform poorly. As anxiety increases to a moderate level, perceptions 
sharpen. Students feel alert, energetic, clear-minded, motivated, and 
at their creative best. Not surprisingly, performance reaches an opti-
mal level. But if anxiety continues to rise to higher and higher levels, 
the effect is catastrophic. Students become increasingly indecisive, 
make careless errors, and show poor judgment. Overwhelmed by 
anxiety, students become disorganized, and they can neither func-
tion effectively nor think clearly. Performance plummets until, at the 
Figure 9-1  Anxiety/Performance Graph

ANXIETY

High

Conquer Test Anxiety   153
highest levels of anxiety, they freeze up, their minds go blank, and 
total panic sets in.
	
Once begun, this process is self-perpetuating and extremely dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to reverse. Students caught in this bind may 
have no choice but to abandon the situation. One student I worked 
with said he totally blanked out on his exam and sat for 30 minutes 
in a state of panic. He finally left and decided to go home. As he 
opened the door of his car, all the information he needed for the test 
came flowing into his mind. He could see all the formulas, all the 
answers to the problems he had just been staring at. It was as if the 
doors of memory opened, the floodgates burst, and everything came 
rushing in. But it was too late!
	
The key to sustained successful performance on exams is keeping 
your anxiety within a moderate, manageable level, thus preventing it 
from ever reaching destructive proportions. You may do this by using 
a three-pronged approach: (a) reverse negative self-talk, (b) use relax-
ing and calming techniques, and (c) practice visualization.
Reverse Negative Self-Talk
The first target in test anxiety reduction is the most devastating of all 
psychological culprits: negative self-talk. I have found students who 
suffer test panic repeat a continuous stream of negative, self-defeating 
statements to themselves before, and especially during, an exam. 
Here are some examples of damaging statements students say:
	
I can’t do it.
	
I’ll never finish all this in time.
	
It’s too difficult for me.
	
I feel so dumb when it comes to math.
	
Everyone else knows how to do this but me.
	
I just don’t have the ability.
	
Who am I fooling? I don’t know what I’m doing.
	
I’ve had trouble with math all my life.
	
I hate tests.
	
I hate this course; I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t required.
	
Why do I need to learn this anyway?
	
I’m too nervous to concentrate.
	
Maybe I should just drop this course.

154    C H A P T E R   9
	
The teacher’s sure to ask me things I don’t know, and I’ll blow it 
again.
	
Who cares about this test [course] anyway?
	
I always do well on the homework, but the test is never like the 
homework.
	
The problem looks too easy; I probably got it wrong.
	
Statements like these tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies. 
Students focus their attention and energy on this continuous stream 
of inner dialogue. They think less clearly, concentration diminishes, 
attention wanders, and they have less energy for dealing with difficult 
questions on the exam. More and more, they become distracted by 
disturbing or intrusive thoughts. Daydreams about being in a more 
pleasant environment—any other place than where they are—are 
common. Slight noises or movements in the exam room soon become 
monumental distractions. Anxiety levels shoot way out of control.
	
How can you deal with these negative self-statements? The most 
crucial step is to become aware of the negative mind talk and its 
ability to sabotage your efforts for success on an exam. Most stu-
dents are not even aware of their negative inner dialogue, let alone 
the devastating effects it has on their performance.
E X E R C I S E  9 - 6  	Become Aware of Continuous  
Inner Dialogue
Tune in to your thoughts and observe the little voices in your mind. What 
do your hear in your mind when you worry or fret about an upcoming exam? 
What thoughts get you nervous? What are your worst fears? What thoughts 
stop you in your tracks and sabotage you? What negative things are you 
telling yourself? Write them down here.
	
Once you identify your negative self-statements and bring them 
into the open, you can deal with them more rationally and effectively. 
The next step is to challenge each of these negative, self-defeating

statements and reverse them to positive, self-enhancing statements. 
Examples of negative to positive shifts include the following:

E X E R C I S E  9 - 7  	Negative to Positive Self-Statement Shifts
In the following spaces, create your own negative to positive shifts. List the 
negative thoughts causing you to be anxious before an exam and then shift 
them to positive, achievement-enhancing ones. Be sure to use only positive 
terms. Avoid all conditional statements (“should” and “could”), and write 
the positive statements in the present tense. Although you may not at the 
moment believe the positive statement is true for you, it is nevertheless 
necessary to state it: no “wills,” “ifs,” or future tense.

This process of changing negative to positive self-statements will help 
to demystify and disempower your negative self-talk, and eventually, 
it will fall by the wayside. Every time a negative thought or self-
­statement reappears, you should reverse it to a positive statement.
	
If, despite all efforts, some negative thoughts continue to plague 
you, a useful technique to overcome them is the thought-stoppage 
procedure.
E X E R C I S E  9 - 8  	Thought-Stoppage Technique
Use this technique whenever a disturbing or distracting thought comes to 
mind. First, in your mind, you are to yell “Stop,” and then say “calm.” Then 
deliberately relax by taking several deep, comfortable breaths. The aim is 
to get at least a momentary break in the negative thought process, making 
it possible to achieve conscious control and regulation of self-defeating in-
ner dialogue. Each time the negative or disturbing thought comes to mind, 
repeat this procedure: yell “Stop,” say “calm,” and then deliberately relax. 
Allow this technique to become automatic, and soon the negative thoughts 
will be completely eliminated.
E X E R C I S E  9 - 9  	Positive Statements for Academic Success
To keep inner dialogue positive and reinforcing, repeatedly conjure up 
positive statements, and visualize them being true. In the following list, 
check off the positive statements you think would be most rewarding to you  
(check at least five). Be sure to add some of your own.
_____	 I’m a good student.

I ask students to write positive statements such as the ones in 
Exercise 9-9 and post them on their mirror, on the refrigerator door, 
or in the place they usually study for exams. Soon magical things 
happen. Students report they feel better, they study better, and 
they’re calmer during tests. Say and visualize positive statements 
and you, too, can create self-fulfilling prophecies. You will begin to 
feel better. Your attitude will improve, and your anxiety level will 
decrease. You will be able to function better and more efficiently. 
Always keep in mind whenever negative self-statements creep into 
your thoughts, either during studying or test taking, you must push 
them away, tell them to stop, and then deliberately relax. You must 
focus on relaxing, remaining positive, and refocusing your attention 
on your studies or the test at hand.
Relaxation
This brings us to the second part of my three-pronged approach for 
dealing with the psychological aspects of test anxiety: relaxation. 
One of the most important things you can do in the weeks, days, and 
even minutes before an exam is to practice calming and relaxation 
techniques. You should not study up to the last minute before an 
exam. Repeatedly, I’ve seen students who did this and then went into 
the exam and panicked or completely blanked out. Instead, in the 
last half-hour before the exam, I recommend you calm yourself down 
using the Calming Breath or Deep Abdominal Breathing techniques 
recorded on the CD accompanying this workbook and described in 
Chapter 3. By practicing slow breathing from deep within your lower 
lungs, you will gain control over your anxiety response and prevent 
it from accelerating and escalating to high levels. Remember, moder-
ate, manageable anxiety is the key to successful performance.
E X E R C I S E  9 - 1 0  	Practice the Calming Techniques  
(See Chapter 3)
Practice a deep, slow breathing pattern for a few minutes each day in the 
days before your exam and in the half-hour prior to your exam. Fill your 
lungs completely, feel your abdomen expand, hold the air a moment, and 
then slowly exhale.

Test-anxious students find it especially beneficial to keep to 
themselves before the exam. Don’t get to the exam too early, and 
avoid talking with classmates, if possible. This is important for two 
reasons. First, it prevents you from picking up other students’ anxi-
ety or from becoming anxious because of something they might say. 
Second, the first recall after studying is usually the best. I’ve met 
students who reported someone asked them a question before the 
exam, and they responded correctly but then proceeded to get the 
problem wrong on the exam. So be a hermit! When you do arrive for 
the exam, find a comfortable seat and begin to focus on being calm, 
positive, and relaxed.
	
Maintain a calm, slow breathing pattern throughout the exam, 
while continuing to say positive self-statements. Push away all dis-
tracting or disturbing thoughts and focus on staying positive and 
calm. If you feel your anxiety increasing during the exam, stop and 
do Deep Abdominal Breathing. You are in control. By keeping your 
anxiety at a moderate level, you will be able to think clearly and do 
your best.
Visualization
The final part of my approach for dealing with the psychological as-
pects of test anxiety uses visualization. Here, while in a deep state 

160    C H A P T E R   9
of relaxation, you are to visualize yourself feeling confident, capable, 
relaxed, and successful while taking your math exam. It is important 
to practice the “Math Test Anxiety Reduction Visualization” (Exer-
cise 9-11) each day for at least 5 days before the exam! The CD ac-
companying this workbook contains this visualization on track five. 
Listen to it often. It is particularly important to practice it the eve-
ning before and the morning of the exam. Listen in a peaceful, quiet, 
darkened place where you can be alone and undisturbed.
E X E R C I S E  9 - 1 1  	A “Math Test Anxiety  
Reduction Visualization”
Begin by assuming a comfortable, relaxed position. Let your body settle 
down inside and, gently and slowly, close your eyes. It is easier to concen-
trate on relaxation with your eyes closed.
	
Let’s begin by focusing on your breathing for a few moments. Take a 
deep and comfortable breath, filling your lungs completely . . . hold it a 
moment . . . and then . . . very, very slowly, let it out . . . slowly . . . feeling 
a wave of relaxation going from the top of your head all the way down to 
your toes. . . . Now I would like you to take another deep and comfortable 
breath, filling your lungs completely . . . hold it a moment . . . and then . . . 
once again let it out . . . very, very slowly, feeling another wave of relaxation 
going from the top of your head all the way down to your toes . . . slowly . . . 
feeling more and more relaxed.
	
Continue to breathe slowly, deeply, regularly. As you breathe in, concen-
trate first on filling the lower part of your lungs, then the middle part, and 
then the upper part. Feel your abdomen slowly expanding . . . now exhale 
very, very slowly . . . slowly, saying “relax” as you do so. Continue breathing 
slowly and regularly, filling your lungs completely and then so, so slowly 
exhaling, saying “relax,” and feeling relaxed. Allow each breath to take you 
into a deeper and deeper state of relaxation. Continue alone for a few min-
utes. (Pause for 2 minutes.)
	
Feel your mind and body becoming more and more peaceful and se-
rene. . . . And now, beginning at the top of your head, allow all the tension to 
leave your body, relaxing further and further. Let go of all the tension in your 
scalp, forehead, and the tiny muscles around your eyes. . . . Relax your jaws. 
. . . Allow your neck and shoulder muscles to go loose and limp. . . . Continue 
to breathe slowly and deeply, saying “relax” with every exhalation. . . . Feel 

Conquer Test Anxiety   161
all the tension drain out of your arms and hands. . . . Now allow your chest, 
abdomen, and back to relax. . . . Feel the relaxation flowing through and 
soothing each and every vertebra of your spinal column, from the top all the 
way down to the bottom. (Pause for 30 seconds.) Now feel the tension drain-
ing from your hips, down your legs, and out the bottoms of your feet. You are 
relaxing more and more with every breath you take. (Pause for 20 seconds.)
	
Now say to yourself and visualize the following (pause for 5 to 8 seconds 
between statements):
	
I see myself accomplishing my goals.
	
I can eliminate all distracting and disturbing thoughts.
	
I have confidence in myself.
	
I am an intelligent, talented person.
	
My memory is improving each day.
	
I see myself relaxed and calm on my math exam.
	
I see myself relaxed, calm, alert, and confident on my math exam.
	
I am relaxed, calm, capable, and confident on my exam.
	
I see my math exam going well for me.
	
My mind is calm, clear, and alert during my math exam.
	
I see myself succeeding in math.
	
I now say to myself, over and over, my own special positive affirmations 
and visualize them being true for me.
	
(Pause for 1 minute.)
	
Next I would like you to imagine that you have just finished all your 
studying and reviewing for a math exam tomorrow. . . . You are feeling good. 
You have studied well, and you are confident that you will do well on the 
exam tomorrow. . . . You get ready for bed and you snuggle down under the 
blankets, but before going off to sleep, you practice relaxation. You slowly 
and deeply breathe in and out . . . saying “relax” with every exhalation 
and visualizing the exam going well tomorrow. . . . You soon fall off to sleep 
knowing you will have a good night’s sleep. . . .
	
Now imagine yourself awakening the next morning. You are feeling 
good. You have had a good night’s sleep, and you feel refreshed, clear, and 
alert. You eat a nutritious breakfast of low-fat protein to help sustain your 
alertness. You’re feeling so good. You recall all the studying and review-
ing your have done in the past weeks for today’s exam, and you know that 
you know the material. You have organized yourself well, reviewed often, 
and you have confidence that you will do well on the exam today. . . . Again 

162    C H A P T E R   9
you spend a few minutes relaxing and visualizing the exam going well 
­today. . . .
	
Now imagine that you are on your way to school. What are your sur-
roundings like? Is the sun shining? What color is the sky? How does the 
air feel against your cheek? Now see yourself walking toward the building 
where your test will be given. Notice the colors, the sounds, the smells, the 
shadows. You are now entering the building and slowly approaching the 
room. You are not too early or too late for the exam. You have scheduled your 
time well to arrive just in time. You are like a hermit before the exam; you 
avoid any contacts or discussion about the test with anyone. You keep your-
self in a peaceful, calm state. You slowly enter the room. You find a seat.
	
As you sit quietly in your chair waiting for the exam to be passed out, 
you close your eyes or focus them on a point of light in the distance. You 
tune out the other people in the room and turn inward for a few moments. 
You breathe slowly and deeply from your lower lungs, and you take yourself 
through the relaxation process you have practiced the last few days, saying 
“relax” with every exhalation. As you do this, you feel all the tension leave 
your body, dissipating into nothingness. A sense of well-being comes over 
you. As you sit there, you recall the studying and reviewing you did for this 
exam; you see your lecture notes, your textbook notes, the many problems 
you’ve worked out. You see the formulas, the important concepts, and the 
solutions to difficult problems. You recall all the time and effort you put into 
reviewing all the information, and you know that you know your work. You 
are feeling capable and confident. You are calm and relaxed, yet clear and 
alert. (Pause for 15 seconds.)
	
Now imagine that you are given the exam. You read the directions care-
fully, underlining all significant words so that you won’t overlook them or 
misinterpret them. You skim through the whole test, noticing the ideas 
covered, the types of problems, and the point values. You smile to yourself 
because you recognize all that is being asked of you, and you feel good about 
your preparation. (Pause for 10 seconds.)
	
You proceed confidently through the exam, beginning with the ques-
tions that appeal to you. You don’t necessarily begin with the first question 
if you don’t want to. You may choose the ones that seem easiest or most fun. 
By doing these first, your confidence grows. You feel good. You feel alert, 
assured, and calm. (Pause for 20 seconds.) You continue through the exam, 
pacing yourself well. You recall your notes, handouts, homework assign-
ments, and class discussions. You proceed confidently through the exam. 
When you come to difficult questions that you are not sure how to answer, 

Conquer Test Anxiety   163
you leave them for a while and simply go to easier ones. As your confidence 
builds, you soon return to these difficult questions, and the answers come 
to you much more readily. With some of the difficult questions, you simply 
sit back, take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and say to yourself, “relax.” You 
soon find that the answers to these questions come to you much more read-
ily and quickly. You have studied all the information. You know you know 
the work. You are very capable. By staying calm and relaxed, you are able 
to function at your highest level on the exam. You are feeling calm, relaxed, 
confident, and capable. (Pause for 15 seconds.)
	
Now I would like you to imagine that you have completed the exam. You 
spend a few minutes checking it for errors, omissions, and reasonableness 
of the solutions. (Pause for 15 seconds.) You are feeling relaxed and calm 
and in no hurry to leave the room until you have finished checking your 
paper. . . . Now imagine that you hand in the exam paper. You leave the 
room. Once in the fresh air, you take a deep breath and exhale slowly. . . . 
You feel refreshed and happy. The exam has gone well, and you have done 
the best job you could. You are feeling wonderful. You have remained calm, 
alert, confident, and capable throughout the exam. The exam has gone well 
for you, and you know that you will remain calm and relaxed for exams in 
the future. . . . Be sure to give yourself a special treat later in the day for 
handling the exam so well.
	
Now I would like you to slowly and gently bring yourself back to this 
room, carrying with you the pleasant feelings and thoughts that you experi-
enced during this exercise.
Performance Health Tips
It has been said the body is the temple of the soul. I have often found 
test-anxious students to be poor overseers of the golden temples in 
which they reside. They eat poorly, sleep minimally, and exercise 
rarely. Battling fatigue and nervous exhaustion with little or no fuel 
or resources, they easily fall prey to their nemesis—test anxiety.
	
Many students get far fewer than the recommended 7 to 8 hours 
of sleep each night. Fatigue and exhaustion reduce efficiency and 
cause poor memory and recall. Time for relaxation and meditation 
also may be missing from a student’s busy schedule. Twenty minutes 
of reverie or silent contemplation can often make up for a shortened 
night’s sleep.

164    C H A P T E R   9
	
Students also have a tendency to stop exercising in the days or 
weeks before a test. A regular program of moderate exercise (for ex-
ample, walking or biking for 20 minutes a day) can greatly reduce 
stress, as well as increase alertness, clear thinking, and energy level.
	
For many students, caffeinated beverages such as coffee or soda 
are the culprit. In an attempt to be more alert for a test, students may 
decide to drink more caffeine than they usually do or drink caffeine 
when they are not normally caffeine drinkers. Unfortunately, exces-
sive caffeine or caffeine taken by people who are not accustomed to it 
can only make them jittery, “hyper,” or shaky for the test. If they were 
already anxious, this added shakiness may cause them to panic!
	
Poor nutrition, such as an unbalanced diet or eating high-caloric, 
fatty meals, can negatively affect a student’s thinking and problem-
solving abilities.
	
Judith Wurtman’s Managing Your Mind and Mood through Food 
contains an excellent discussion of the effects the foods we eat have 
on our brain’s ability to process information. Tyrosine, for example, 
an amino acid found in protein, is the principal ingredient in two 
neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters, dopamine and norepi-
nephrine, produce alertness, clarity of mind, motivation, and drive. 
Research shows that with an adequate supply of these two neu-
rotransmitters, people tend to think more quickly, react more rap-
idly, feel more attentive, and experience greater mental endurance 
and energy.
	
Wurtman’s studies show eating only 3 or 4 ounces of low-fat pro-
tein foods, either alone or with carbohydrates, makes tyrosine avail-
able to the brain if the brain has used its current supply and needs 
to replace it. This process has an energizing effect, increasing alert-
ness, accuracy, and motivation. The brain responds more quickly and 
is prepared for mental challenges. 
	
The best foods to choose for heightening brain power before an 
exam include 3 or 4 ounces of any one of the following:
	
fish
	
chicken without the skin
	
veal
	
very lean beef with all the fat trimmed
	
nonfat or low-fat yogurt
	
low-fat cottage cheese

Conquer Test Anxiety   165
	
tofu
	
lentils, dried peas, or beans
	
Avoid large meals and high-fat foods before tests because they 
tend to dull the mind and slow mental processes. They produce leth-
argy and drowsiness. You must avoid foods such as lamb, pork and 
pork products, luncheon meats, hard cheeses, fatty beef, whole milk 
regular yogurt (as opposed to nonfat or low-fat), butter, mayonnaise, 
fried foods, creamed soups, and rich gravies and sauces.
	
In addition to tyrosine, another amino acid, tryptophane, is found 
naturally in food and significantly affects our brain’s ability to func-
tion. I am referring to tryptophane in its natural form, not in a pill. 
Naturally occurring tryptophane is the principal ingredient in the 
neurotransmitter serotonin.
	
Serotonin has a calming effect on the mind. It reduces feelings of 
tension and stress. Concentration and focus improve. Distractions 
are more easily eliminated. Reaction time may be slowed. And if you 
eat serotonin-producing foods in the evening or before bedtime, they 
may induce drowsiness or sleep.
	
Eating only 1 or 1.5 ounces of carbohydrate alone, without protein, 
increases your brain’s level of serotonin. You will experience a calm-
ing, relaxing, more focused effect. Your powers of concentration will 
increase, and your feelings of anxiety and frustration will ease. People 
who are 20% over their recommended weight or premenstrual women 
may require 2 or 2.5 ounces of carbohydrates to get this effect.
	
The best foods to choose for producing a calming, focused effect 
while studying include:
	
cereals	
crackers	
popcorn
	
muffins	
pasta	
potatoes
	
bagels	
rice	
bread
	
pancakes	
barley	
corn
	
Here is a summary of recommended health guidelines:
	
1.	 Make it a rule to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep regularly, especially 
before tests.
	
2.	 Allow time each day to meditate or relax. This is particularly 
important if you had little sleep or experienced insomnia the 
night before a test.

166    C H A P T E R   9
	
3.	 Participate in a program of moderate exercise for at least 20 
minutes each day or every other day. Don’t stop exercising 
around test time.
	
4.	 Eating for high mental energy requires you eat small, low-
­caloric, low-fat meals and you get proteins into your system 
before, or along with, carbohydrates. So do not begin your meal 
with carbohydrates, but with protein. Remember: You need 
only 3 or 4 ounces of protein. High amounts of protein may ac-
tually have a reverse effect on some people. Ideal foods include 
fish, chicken, veal, nonfat yogurt, tofu, lentils, and peas.
	
5.	 Time your high-energy meal to occur about 1 to 2 hours before 
you must meet the mental challenge of taking a test.
	
6.	 To help you get adequate sleep before the test, eat high­
carbohydrate, low-protein (or even better, no protein) foods for 
dinner or in the evening to induce drowsiness and sleep.
	
7.	 If at any time while studying you feel mentally frustrated, 
scattered, and can’t seem to settle down, eat small amounts of 
carbohydrate to help calm you and focus your concentration. 
Although carbohydrates in the form of sugar also have this ef-
fect, be sure to eat no more than 1 or 2 ounces. Too much sug-
ar causes negative emotional reactions in some people. Ideal 
carbohydrates to help settle you down are popcorn, bread, 
crackers, muffins, bagels, potatoes, rice, and pasta.
	
8.	 Don’t overeat or eat foods with high fat content. These will 
only make you lethargic and dull.
	
9.	 Avoid excessive use of caffeinated beverages, such as coffee or 
soda. If you don’t normally drink caffeine, don’t start now, par-
ticularly not before a test.
Be Your Own Exam Coach: Put It All Together
As a coach, you can boost your self-confidence, give yourself pep 
talks, keep yourself focused on the task at hand, push away distrac-
tions, and set realistic, achievement-oriented exam goals.
	
Too many math-anxious students set weak or ineffective exam 
goals: They do not want to do badly or to fail or appear dumb. Avoid-
ance goals such as these lead a student in the opposite direction from 
success. They may lead directly to fears, worries, negative thinking, 
and worst of all, increased anxiety and stress. 

Conquer Test Anxiety   167
	
If you’ve set avoidance goals in the past, why not change your ap-
proach? What if you coached yourself to set exam goals realistically 
related to what you could strive for and achieve? Here are examples 
of such goals:
	
1.	 I want to achieve at least 10 points higher than I did on my 
last exam.
	
2.	 I want to demonstrate to myself that I have mastered these 
math skills.
	
3.	 I want to remain calm and relaxed on this exam and be able to 
think clearly.
	
4.	 I want to tackle the easiest questions first, then the next 
easiest, and so on, until I can complete all the questions on the 
exam.

Summary
Don’t allow test anxiety ever again to detract from your math achieve-
ment. What once was an overwhelming and fear-producing event can 
now be handled in a constructive, positive, growth-enhancing man-
ner. This section of our road map focused on methods for markedly 
reducing math test anxiety. I’ve stressed good nutritional habits, ad-
equate sleep, relaxation and exercise, and effective test preparation 
and test-taking strategies. In particular, I highlighted ways to deal 
with psychological factors through a special three-pronged approach. 
This approach includes a combination of shifts from negative to posi-
tive self-talk, calming techniques, and the utilization of my specially 
designed “Math Test Anxiety Reduction Visualization.” I concluded 
this chapter with an exercise to put it all together, the Math Test 
Anxiety Reduction Checklist and a self-assessment of optimal perfor-
mance. I encouraged you to be your own coach, to set positive exam 
goals, and to reflect on what worked for you on your test.

In Greek mythology, Sisyphus, the greedy King of Corinth, incurred 
the wrath of the supreme deity, Zeus. Sisyphus was punished by be-
ing forced to toil eternally, pushing a huge boulder up a steep hill. 
Each night, he’d fall asleep, exhausted, only to have the boulder roll 
back down again. Each day, this endless, toilsome, useless process 
was repeated. 
	
Like Sisyphus, we often spend our lives in routine tasks made 
difficult only by our perceived individual limitations. We set up self-
imposed boundaries. We limit our vision. We do things only one way, 
without experimenting with alternative approaches. 
	
Barriers to accomplishments are unproductive and must not be 
maintained. We must challenge the status quo. We must open our 
minds to new ways of thinking. How wonderful to choose to be part 
of the solution, not the problem.
	
To some students, solving math equations and handling word 
problems can loom as menacingly as Sisyphus’s boulder in the Greek 
myth. But it’s just that—only a myth. So stand back, take a deep 
breath, and realize that information, insight, and understanding can 
soften the harsh lines of resignation we draw in the sand. Compre-
hension breeds success, but there are tricks to it. Academic success 
hinges on learning the tricks.
	
A physicist friend once shared her secret for academic success. In 
college, she realized her teachers used thinking approaches unique 
to their disciplines. For example, her math teacher thought quite 
differently from her biology or psychology teachers. She found if she 
could train herself to think like a chemist, or a sociologist, or a math-

ematician, or for that matter, like any other subject area specialist, 
she was successful in learning the subject material.
	
How do mathematicians think? One math instructor told me, 
“Math is to the mind as weight training is to the body.” What an in-
teresting concept. Math does strengthen our thinking, just as a well-
planned exercise program strengthens our muscles. Since the heart 
of math is problem solving, mathematicians are actually doing “mind 
building” when they’re solving problems. In this chapter, we work on 
taking the mystery out of how mathematicians think. We also exam-
ine approaches to problem solving and word problems.
	
Mathematicians train their minds to think logically. In this type 
of thinking, when given a problem, the person proceeds step by step 
and uses specific rules to draw a conclusion or derive a solution. This 
is not to say problems can’t be solved in other ways, for they often 
are. Some students intuitively solve equations or problems. They 
are certain they know the answer but cannot explain how they got 
it. Others use their own personal approaches to problem solving and 
have been successful. There are still others who look at how similar 
problems are solved, and through comparison and association, they 
figure out the correct solution. These are all fine ways to solve prob-
lems, though none is a fail-safe method for consistent success.
	
If you are one of these people, in addition to using your own 
­problem-solving strategies, I would like to encourage you also to 
practice how mathematicians think. By using their disciplined, logi-
cal thinking approach, you will have more resources to successfully 
tackle and solve more and more math problems. Like a gold medal 
Olympic gymnast, you can go for the gold.
	
When thinking like a mathematician, you will also be enhanc-
ing your left- and right-brain thinking. Our brains have two cortical 
hemispheres. The left hemisphere is superior in language, math, 
judging time and rhythm, and at ordering complex movements. This 
hemisphere can analyze things and break information into smaller 
and smaller bits. It can process information sequentially, one bit at a 
time, one after the other. The mathematician’s logical approach fits 
into left-brain thinking. On the other hand, the right hemisphere is 
superior in nonverbal skills such as perceptual and spatial skills, 
visualization, drawing pictures, putting puzzles together, simple lan-
guage comprehension, and recognizing faces, patterns, and melodies. 

174    C H A P T E R   1 0   
The right brain tends to process material simultaneously, in a mul-
tidimensional fashion, as if all aspects of the situation are seen at 
once. Intuitively knowing how to solve a problem fits into right-brain 
thinking.
	
Most people do not rely on only one hemisphere. Brain studies 
show there is an interplay between the left and right hemispheres in 
almost all human activities. In fact, the most creative thinkers are 
engaging both left- and right-brain thinking on a continuous basis. 
However, there are some people who tend to prefer either left- or 
right-brain thinking. These individuals may limit their career or col-
lege major choices to those highlighting their thinking preference. 
They may choose certain activities more often than others. They 
would approach problem solving and decision making differently 
from those who use both brain hemispheres more equally. Exercise 
10-1 will help you see if you are more right-brained or left-brained 
when solving problems.
E X E R C I S E  1 0 - 1  	Are You a Left-Brain or Right-Brain 
Problem Solver?
As you know, most people use both sides of their brains for dealing 
with virtually all activities. In fact, the best problem solvers are con-
stantly using both sides of their brains. However, some people prefer 
a thinking style favoring their right or their left brain. You may be 
one of these people. To determine this, carefully read the following 
statements. Give yourself three points if the item usually applies to 
you, two points if it sometimes applies, one point if it rarely applies, 
and zero if it never applies.
A. Are You a Left-Brain Thinker?
_____	 1.	 Before making a decision, I like to compare and contrast many 
ideas.
_____	 2.	 I would prefer settling a disagreement based on what is fair and 
reasonable.
_____	 3.	 I like working within a structured format where things follow a 
logical sequence.

Analysis of Results:
A score of 22 or above on section A, with a score of 18 or below on section B, 
indicates you have a strong preference for left-brain thinking. On the other 
hand, if you have a score of 22 or above on section B, with a score of 18 or 
below on section A, you probably have a strong preference for right-brain 
thinking. If your scores on sections A and B are similar (within 1 or 2 points 
of each other), you are not showing a preference for using one side of your 
brain over the other. Scores of 22 or above on both sections show a strong 
preference for using both sides of your brain when solving problems.
	
When you jump out of an airplane with a parachute on your 
back, your life is on the line. Your survival depends on following a 
well-practiced sequence of known steps. When you rock climb on a 
sheer 100-foot wall, your life is on the line. Your survival depends 
on following a well-planned sequence of steps. When you scuba dive 
for sunken deep-sea treasure, your life is on the line. Your survival 
depends on following a well-rehearsed sequence of steps. Although 
these examples may seem extreme, they do illustrate an interesting 
and little discussed point. Risk taking and the mathematician’s logi-
cal problem-solving approach share many features. They both rely 
on left-brain function.
	
Psychologist Roger Drake and others found that people have an 
increased willingness to make risky decisions when their left hemi-
sphere is more active than their right. Research shows the right 
hemisphere is associated with a more cautious cognitive style. So if 
your preference is right-brain thinking, you may be more hesitant 
and wary when approaching math problems. You may be less likely 
to jump in and start working with the numbers and figuring out so-
lutions. Rather than risk being wrong, you might never even try. Is 
this you? If so, I would like to challenge you to work on stimulating 
your left-brain thinking. Work on practicing the mathematicians’ 
logical problem-solving approach. This will help you take more risks 
in solving math problems, and with this increase in your risk taking, 
you will certainly add to your potential for math success. Exercise 
10-2 provides you with some suggestions and experience for practic-
ing left-brain logical sequencing skills.

Polya’s Problem-Solving Tricks
In mathematician George Polya’s famous book, How to Solve It 
(Princeton University Press, 1971), he published his classic problem- 
solving model, along with a host of suggestions, advice, rules of 
thumb, and strategies for solving problems. His problem-solving 
model has four steps:
	
1.	 Understanding the problem.
	
2.	 Devising a plan.
	
3.	 Carrying out the plan.
	
4.	 Looking back.
This model will help you follow a logical thinking approach, starting 
with some given information and proceeding step by step until you 
reach a reasonable conclusion. 
	
In the first step, ask yourself to restate the problem in your own 
words. What is this problem really asking you to do? What are the 
unknowns involved? What information does the problem give you 
and what is missing?
	
In Polya’s second step, you look for patterns. Ask yourself: Is this 
problem related to previous problems you have solved, preferably 

Be a Successful Problem Solver   179
simpler ones? Can the same technique used on previous problems be 
used here? If you can’t find a similar related problem, is it possible to 
restate the present problem? Can you draw a chart, table, diagram, 
or model to illustrate what is being sought? Can you work backward? 
You may wish to “guess and test.”
	
In the second step, if you can’t figure out how to solve the prob-
lem, can you divide the problem into smaller parts and identify 
subgoals to solve? This is also known as “divide and conquer.” But 
no matter what, don’t get discouraged, because even Polya says, in 
addition to formerly acquired knowledge, good mental habits, and 
concentration on purpose, you may need “good luck.” This part of 
Polya’s model certainly brings in some right-brain thinking.
	
In Polya’s third step, you are to carry out a plan. Here, you 
should perform the necessary computations. Do all the geometric 
or algebraic operations you identified in step two. Check each step 
of your plan as you proceed, either using a formal proof or your own 
“intuitive” approach. What’s neat about Polya’s guidelines is his inte-
gration of intuition with logic. Again, you can see the importance of 
incorporating right- and left-brain thinking.
	
In the final step, you can check the result of your problem and 
interpret the solution in terms of the original problem. Ask yourself: 
Is there another, more direct solution?
	
After your solution is found, Polya urges you not to shut your 
book or look for something else to do. Try to determine other related 
or more general problems for which your results or methods would 
work. He says, “By looking back at the completed solution, by recon-
sidering and reexamining the result and the path that led to it,” you 
can consolidate as well as acquire well-ordered, ready-to-use knowl-
edge and further develop your ability to solve problems.
	
Polya’s problem-solving approach is certainly very straightfor-
ward and makes good sense. Now let’s apply it to a word problem 
presented earlier in this book (see Exercise 4-3):
A business executive left her car in an all-night park-
ing garage for three and a half days. The garage 
charges either an hourly rate of $1.25 or a daily rate 
of $24 for whole or partial days. Is she better off pay-
ing the hourly or the daily rate?

180    C H A P T E R   1 0   
Step 1: Understanding the Problem
What is this problem really asking you to do? What are the un-
knowns involved? What information does the problem give you and 
what is missing?
	
This problem is asking us to determine which rate would be 
cheaper for the executive to pay. The problem tells us the hourly rate 
is $1.25, the daily rate is $24, and our business executive stayed 3 
and a half days, which is equivalent to 24 (hours) times 3 (days) plus 
12 (the hours in half a day), or a total of 84 hours. We must find the 
cost for 84 hours using the hourly rate of $1.25. Since the daily rate 
will be charged for whole days, the cost of 3 and a half days would be 
the same as 4 whole days.
Step 2: Devising a Plan
Can you draw a chart, table, diagram, or model to illustrate what 
is being sought? Can you divide the problem into smaller parts and 
identify subgoals to solve?
	
This problem can be solved by identifying the subgoal to solve—
that is, multiplying out the hourly and daily rates. A table would be 
very helpful for easy comparison. The table would look like this:
Hourly Rate	
Daily Rate
	
84	hours (same as 3 days, 12 hours)	
	
4	days (actually 3 days, 12 hours)
×	 $1.25	
×	 $24
	
?		
	
?
Step 3: Carrying Out the Plan
You should perform the necessary computations.
Hourly Rate	
Daily Rate
	
84	hours (same as 3 days, 12 hours)	
	
4	days (actually 3 days, 12 hours)
×	 $1.25	
×	 $24
	$105		
	 $96
From this calculation, it is evident that the daily rate would be 
cheaper than the hourly rate.

Be a Successful Problem Solver   181
Step 4: Looking Back
Now look back at the completed solution; reconsider and reexamine 
the result and the path that led to it. Check the results of your prob-
lem and interpret the solution in terms of the original problem. Is 
there another, more direct solution? Can you determine other related 
or more general problems for which your results or methods would 
work?
	
From this problem, we can see that setting up a table is an ef-
fective problem-solving method for comparing two or more price 
calculations. The table shows us that the daily rate, totaling $96, is 
the better buy. If combining both rates were a choice, we would have 
come up with an even lower price. In other words, paying the daily 
rate for 3 days and then the hourly rate for the 12 hours would have 
been $72 plus $15, totaling only $87.
	
Now that we’ve applied Polya’s problem-solving model to a word 
problem, let’s look at other tricks for tackling word problems.
Tackle Word Problems:  
Develop Your Own 12-Point System
I’ve encountered many students who find word problems difficult. 
When reading the problem, their minds become overwhelmed, they 
short-circuit, and shut down. At this point, nothing more goes in or 
out. They feel hopeless and close their books. If this ever happens to 
you, help is on the way.
	
I want to share with you some secrets I’ve discovered about word 
problems. First, it is important to realize all word problems are just 
made-up situations to challenge your thinking. To illustrate this 
point, I made up the two word problems in Exercise 4-3 in this text-
book, and I am a psychologist and not a mathematician. So, you, too, 
can make up word problems.
	
The second secret is that words in a word problem can be changed 
into an equation. Your job is to figure out how to translate the words 
into an equation or equations that you have already learned in 
your class.
	
A third secret is that, usually at the end of the problem, you will 
discover the question you need to solve. When you are ready to set 

182    C H A P T E R   1 0   
up your equation, you can let x stand for your unknown. If there are 
two equations involved, let y stand for the second unknown. Some 
mathematicians even try putting in actual number values for the 
unknowns to make the word problem more meaningful or realistic. 
This is a good trick to try.
	
The fourth secret: You can plug into your equation what you 
know from the word problem—that is, any relative numbers given in 
the sentences. Then you solve the equation for the unknown(s). This 
will be the solution to the word problem.
	
The last and most important secret is that, even for mathemati-
cians, word problems take work. Mathematicians don’t know how to 
solve problems on the first reading unless they’ve done the same prob-
lems before. It takes practice, organization, and a system. Of course, 
they may seem to solve them more quickly than you, but it is because 
they already have established an organization, a system, and a plan 
of attack. Many mathematicians tell me they often have to read word 
problems repeatedly before they know how to proceed. So don’t expect 
the answers to word problems to jump out at you. Read the problem 
over and over again, set your plan of attack, and work.
	
My goal in this section is to give you an organization and a 12-
step system to deal with word problems. This system works!
	
1.	 How can I restate the problem in my own words?
	
2.	 What is the problem asking me to do; that is, what ques­
tion(s) must I answer?
	
3.	 What type of problem is it? For example, is it a money, age, 
investment, work, geometry, mixture, or a simple number 
story problem?
	
4.	 Can I draw a picture, chart, diagram, model, or table to illus-
trate the problem? (This will serve as a trigger and unblock 
your thinking. It helps you to “see” what’s happening.)
	
5.	 Can I make a list of what the problem gives me (known vari-
ables) and what I will have to find (unknown variable[s]) and 
then put these into a table? (Usually, but not always, any 
given number in the problem will be a variable you can use.)
	
6.	 What equations have I learned that might apply here?
	
7.	 How are the pieces of the problem related to the equation(s) I 
have to solve?

Be a Successful Problem Solver   183
	
8.	 Can I plug into the equation(s) the known and unknown 
variables I have in my table (see step 5)?
	
9.	 Do all the units I have plugged into my equation agree? If 
not, can I make them agree?
	
10.	 Can I state in words what I am going to do to solve this 
­problem?
	
11.	 Now can I complete the solution?
	
12.	 If I plug my answer back into the problem, does my solution 
make sense? Is it logical?
Here are some helpful tips on how to translate the words in a word 
problem into parts of an equation:
 
• “is,” “will be,” or “was” becomes the equal sign in your 
­equation
 
• “increased” or “more than” means addition
 
• “decreased” or “less than” means subtraction
 
• “twice as much” means 2 ×
 
• “half as much” means divide by 2
 
• “of” means multiply
 
• “square of” means a number multiplied by itself
	
Now let’s try this system in a word problem I made up, and I 
hope we can have fun with it. But before beginning the problem, 
I want you to close your eyes and spend a few moments relaxing. 
Breathe from your abdomen using a slow, low breathing pattern. Af-
ter you attain a calm state, open your eyes. You are ready to start.
	
Now slowly read through the word problem, while still keeping 
your breathing slow and regular. You may have to read the problem 
a piece at a time or perhaps you will have to read it two, three, five, 
or ten times before you can proceed. Then write down the answers to 
as many of the following questions as you can. 
My Word Problem: One semester, I taught 97 students 
in three different math anxiety reduction classes. In 
class one, I had 8 students more than in class two. 
In class three, I had 7 students fewer than in class 
two. How many students were in each of the three 
classes?

184    C H A P T E R   1 0   
	
Step 1. How can I restate the problem in my own words? “I taught 
three classes and the first and third classes are compared to the en-
rollment in the second class.” Now, that was easy.
	
Step 2. What is this problem asking me to do; that is, what 
question(s) must I answer? The question is: “What’s the enrollment 
in each class?”
	
Step 3. What type of problem is it? I’d say this is a simple number 
or algebraic story problem.
	
Step 4. Can I draw a picture? Well, yes. I’ll let x stand for the 
number of students in class two.
BOX A
Class two 
has x students
BOX B
Class one
has x plus 
8 students
BOX C
Class three
has x minus 
7 students
BOX D
Total students
= 97

Step 5. Can I make a list of what the problem gives me (known 
variables) and what I will have to find (unknown variable[s]) and 
then put these into a table?
	
Knowns	
Unknowns
Class one	
x + 8 students
Class two	
	
x students
Class three	
x – 7 students
Total students	
97
	
Step 6. What equations have I learned that might apply here? 
Simple algebraic formulas with x plus or minus a number would 
work here.
	
Step 7. How are the pieces of the problem related to the equa­tion(s) 
I have to solve? All parts of the problem can be easily dealt with in 
the equations.
	
Step 8. Can I plug into the equation(s) the known and unknown 
variables I have in my table? Answer: Yes.
	
x    +    x + 8    +    x – 7    = 97

Be a Successful Problem Solver   185
	
Step 9. Do all the units I have plugged into my equation agree? 
Yes, they do. The units all refer to the number of students.
	
Step 10. Can I state in words what I am going to do to solve this 
problem? If I find the number of students in class two, I will know 
how many students are in classes one and three also.
	
Step 11. Now can I complete the solution?
	
x + x + 8 + x – 7	 =	 97
	
3x + 1	 =	 97	
I collect the like terms, which were  
3 xs, and I subtract 7 from 8.
	
3x + 1 (–1)	 =	 97 – 1	
I subtract the same number from 
each side.
	
3x	 =	 96
	
	 =	 	
I divided each side by the same 
number.
	
x	 =	 32	
Now we know that class two had 
32 students.
	
x + 8	 =	 40	
Now we know that class one had 
40 students.
	
x – 7	 =	 25	
Now we know that class three had 
25 students.
	
Step 12. If I plug my answer back into the problem, does my so-
lution make sense? Is it logical? Well, we can see that class one was 
8 students more than class two and class three was 7 students less 
than class two. Best yet, all three classes add up to 97 students. So, 
yes, the answers are logical and make sense.
Identify the Exotic Animals  
and Deal with Algebra Problems
For some students, algebra is a stumbling block in their road to suc-
cess. For them, algebra is too abstract, scary, meaningless, or intan-
gible. The thought of dealing with a bunch of xs and ys seems over-
whelming. Their eyes glaze over, and their minds go to sleep. They 
often ask, “Why study algebra?”

I have interviewed a number of students who have come to love 
and appreciate algebra. And I asked them just this question, “Why 
study algebra?” Repeatedly, they tell me the problem-solving skills 
learned in algebra help them deal with everyday life issues. They 
emphasize the benefits gained from algebra’s logical reasoning, criti-
cal thinking skills, and a systematic, structured approach to tackling 
problems. Whether these students are budgeting for a vacation, fig-
uring out a paycheck, or purchasing a house, they use algebra either 
directly or indirectly.
	
In this section, I review some helpful tricks for working on algebra 
problems. Although each problem you deal with will be different, by 
coming up with a problem-solving approach that works for you, you 
will find algebraic equations much easier to tackle. I would like to em-
phasize the most significant thing you can do to be successful in alge-
bra is to practice effective problem-solving techniques and not worry 
about getting the correct answer. Your major goal is to understand 
what is being asked and to see the inherent logic in the question.
	
One of my favorite math teachers suggests you make algebra 
into a game. In this game, you make believe you are in a zoo and 
you are looking at a variety of exotic animals. Now, in this zoo, your 
challenge is to identify all the strange and unusual creatures before 
you. The same thing is true in the game of algebra. When you first 
look at a problem, ask yourself: What type of problem is this? Is it a 
linear equation? Is this a quadratic equation? Whenever you see an 
algebraic equation, immediately translate the equation into words. 
In other words, identify the “exotic animals.” This game will take 
the mystery out of what you are looking at. It will make the abstract 
equation more concrete and meaningful to you.
	
Here are some tips you may wish to use after you have identified 
the type of algebra problem you are working with.
	
1.	 Write down each step. Proceed slowly from one step to the next. 
This will give you a sense of structure and a path to ­follow.
	
2.	 Organize your work. By arranging your work and following 
an order, you are more likely to successfully proceed from one 
step to the next in solving your problem.
	
3.	 Put all your equal signs under one another. In other words, 
line them up. This will reduce any confusion and help you 
clearly see each step of your solution.

Be a Successful Problem Solver   187
	
4.	 Be fair! Since an equation is a statement that two quantities 
or expressions are equal, make sure you always balance both 
sides of the equation. A wonderful math tutor I know always 
tells his students to “Be Fair!” That is, whatever you do to one 
side, do to the other side of your equation.
	
	 	
You can also think of your equation as a perfectly balanced 
rowboat. If you should put a large beer keg at one end of the 
boat without adding something of equal weight to the other 
end, your boat will sink.
	
5.	 Simplify your equation. For example, reduce the parentheses, 
combine like terms, and so forth.
	
6.	 Remember: Whatever you do to a number, you can do to an un-
known (i.e., x or y).
	
7.	 Trial and error may be okay. Sometimes, you may have to plug 
in numbers to figure out how to solve an equation.
	
Many students have come to grips with algebra by treating it like 
a game and a positive mental challenge. Step by step, they follow a 
systematic procedure—and behold—they are led directly to a conclu-
sion. The little xs and ys begin to make sense, and finding solutions 
becomes not only a challenge but also fun.
	
I would like to emphasize that each of the problem-solving sug-
gestions offered in this chapter would work best for you if you prac-
tice them along with the relaxation techniques described earlier in 
this book, have a positive attitude toward math, and a willingness to 
try new patterns of thinking. Good luck!
Build Metacognitive Strategies
In this section, we explore your “cognitive” or thinking processes. 
Let’s begin with a few simple questions: Have you ever observed 
how you think and how you make progress as you acquire new math 
concepts? If a concept is difficult to understand, do you consciously 
adjust your approach or adapt a different one to facilitate your com-
prehension and acquisition of this concept? Lastly, when you solve a 
problem, do you monitor which strategies are most effective, when 
they are appropriate to use, and how they should be applied so you 
can reach your goal? 

188    C H A P T E R   1 0   
	
Metacognition entails all this and more. It is your knowledge and 
in-depth understanding of how you think, learn, and solve problems, 
along with your ability to monitor, regulate, and evaluate the factors 
that influence them. You can think of metacognition as a manage-
ment executive in charge of a large processing plant. If the executive 
manages his or her job well and continues to update, revise, evalu-
ate, and oversee all the systems, then the plant operations will work 
smoothly and efficiently, and the plant will successfully accomplish 
its mission.
	
Individuals who are successful in math use metacognitive strat-
egies all the time. These students constantly monitor and reflect on 
how they learn and progress in math. They check and recheck their 
work. They question why they got something wrong and how they 
can best improve their performance. Their metacognitive strate-
gies help them to feel more confident about math and ensure their 
­success. 
	
Metacognitive strategies are best used before, during, and after 
you study and work out math problems. Self-questioning is an ex-
cellent way to improve your metacognition. Exercise 10-3 suggests 
questions for you to explore. 
E X E R C I S E  1 0 - 3  	Metacognitive Strategies  
for Success in Math
This exercise focuses on the three main stages of metacognition: the plan-
ning stage, the monitoring stage, and the reflection/evaluation stage. Dur-
ing each of these stages, there are important questions to ask yourself. Use 
the following questions to help you improve your metacognition skills:
The Planning Stage: Before you start a math problem-solving session, 
ask these questions:
	 1.	 What do I want to accomplish during this session?

Summary
You, too, can think like a mathematician. You needn’t toil aim-
lessly when given problems to solve. In this chapter, I discussed the 
mathe­matician’s logical problem-solving approach, some practical 
ways to integrate left- and right-brain thinking, and famous mathe-
matician George Polya’s classic problem-solving model. I also shared 
with you the secrets for dealing with word problems, a winning 12-
step system for tackling word problems, and some tricks for solving 
algebra problems. I encouraged you to build your metacognitive 
abilities and I provided important questions to ask yourself during 
the planning, monitoring, and reflection/evaluation stages of meta-
cognition. My goal for you is to meet the challenge of math—and to 
have fun doing it!

Do math . . . and you can do anything!  
—National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Campaign
For many, success in math is synonymous with tackling fear. If 
you’ve come this far, you’ve proven your mettle. You’ve demonstrated 
toughness, a willingness to explore new directions, and a refusal to 
give up and accept the status quo. Such mental resilience is reminis-
cent of Psyche in Greek mythology. A mere mortal, Psyche faced fear-
some tasks and challenges. In overcoming them, she was elevated to 
the status of a goddess.
	
In our everyday lives, the rewards for perseverance may not 
seem so exalted, but they are real nonetheless. Handling fear with 
dogged determination can pay off handsomely. The rewards abound. 
Math is the link.
No longer just the language of science, mathematics now contributes in 
direct and fundamental ways to business, finance, health, and defense. 
For students, it opens doors to careers. For citizens, it enables informed 
decisions. More than ever before, Americans need to think for a living; more 
than ever before, they need to think mathematically.	—National Research 
Council, Everybody Counts: A Report on the Future of Mathematics Education
	
Math opens the doors to your future. To be an active, concerned 
member of this world, you must use the power of math. To be suc-
cessful in school; to have a rewarding, stimulating career; to get the

jobs you want; to be an involved citizen; to have a knowledge of per-
sonal finances, the nation’s economy, and the technological advances 
of modern-day society—all these require you to have an understand-
ing of math. This final section of our road map explores the impor-
tance of math in choosing your career, in assuring higher salaries, 
and in every aspect of today’s ever-changing world.
Why Math?
If you used to think math was a bunch of numbers obscuring your 
appreciation of the world, you had it backward. Math is humankind’s 
constant effort to describe (and put to use) the mysterious workings of 
the universe. Lacking systems of measurement, nonliterate cultures 
could not produce machines, manufactured goods, or reproducible 
structures. Eruptions and earthquakes, storms, and celestial events 
were attributed to superstitious, and therefore nonverifiable, causes.
	
How times change—and so, too, do the needs and demands of an 
increasingly complex society. Seismic analysis, plate tectonics, me-
teorology, and astrophysics have created order out of seeming chaos. 
But our incessant need for precise measurement and manipulation 
of data has outstripped anything ever before imagined.

Math Is the Future   193
	
Many students don’t realize math is far more than the ability to 
calculate, memorize formulas, or solve equations. Math trains your 
mind to think logically and succinctly. It requires you to perceive 
patterns, observe relationships, clarify and critically analyze prob-
lems, deduce consequences, formulate alternatives, test conjectures, 
estimate results, and enhance your problem-solving abilities. By 
sharpening your reasoning and thinking skills, you can become more 
productive in every facet of your life.
	
Math provides you with the resources to comprehend the barrage 
of information communicated to you each day. It gives you the ability 
to be a critical reader of anything you read, from newspaper reports 
and research articles to insurance policies and loan documents. Math 
logic, reasoning, and thinking ability help you to ascertain possible 
risks or fallacies, to unearth biases, and to come up with suggestions 
and alternatives.
	
It’s no wonder so many careers require math skills. Employers 
want to hire individuals who can solve problems, who can think 
clearly on the job, and who can deal with new ideas, ambiguity, and 
change. We are constantly being flooded with technological advances, 
new scientific discoveries, new knowledge. Are you prepared for this 
challenge?
	
The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) has an online 
essay series written by authors describing how their math back-
ground was useful in their careers. Dr. Richard Jarvinen, from Win-
ona State University, wrote about the need for math when he did 
reliability studies and risk assessment for the NASA Space Shuttle 
program. Dr. Michael Monticino, from the University of Texas, used 
math in evaluating antisubmarine warfare tactics, and Dr. Michael 
J. Murray, a JavaTM programmer who worked on the Olympic Inter-
net Team, attributed his ability to query large sports statistics da-
tabases to his roots in math. Dr. Ellen Lentz was an animal science 
major and soon discovered much of modern agricultural development 
was attributable to experimental statistics. After years of using 
statistics to design experiments in veterinarian medicine, she now 
does the same work with human medicines. As a marine research 
associate at the University of Rhode Island, Allison DeLong used 
mathematics/statistics on projects related to fisheries stock assess-
ment and the population dynamics of exploited fish stocks. For more

Math-anxious students frequently ask, “Why do I have to take 
math?” or “Why do I have to learn algebra?” These questions came 
up so often I decided to interview students who enjoyed studying 
math to see how they would answer them. Here are some of their 
­responses:
	
“Name a good-paying job that doesn’t require math.”
	
“Math affects everything I do: balancing my checkbook, checking 
over my bills, paying my credit cards, following my invest-
ments (returns, losses, etc.), shopping for bargains, buying a 
car, figuring out my taxes. It helps computing how much car-
pet to install in my bedroom, how many bundles of shingles 
my roof needs, how much crushed rock will cover my patio, 
in figuring out 30% off prices, totaling how many clock hours 
I put in at work this month, and if I want to cut a recipe in 
half, measuring ingredients.”
	
“Knowing math has saved me thousands when financing my car! 
I was able to figure out that those low-monthly payments 
would have cost me a fortune.”
	
“Besides the obvious reasons, such as figuring out my paycheck 
or comparison shopping, math has helped me to think in a 
logical manner. This, in turn, makes problem solving in my 
classes and in my personal life so much easier.”
	
“Math is one of the first courses where I was taught how to think 
and to reason. It’s helped me think in a methodical way, step 
by step until I can draw a conclusion.”
	
“I figured out a long time ago that people with low math abilities 
are destined to be taken advantage of by insurance agents, 
car salespeople, investment advisers, and politicians. If you 
have reasonable math skills, you have a better chance to 
think for yourself and are less likely to be swindled. For ex-
ample, recently I corrected a cashier who overcharged me 
by accidentally totaling my bill as $184 when it should have 
been $148.”
	
“One thing’s for sure from a career standpoint. Job opportunities 
expand as your math proficiency increases. Besides the obvi-

Math Is the Future   195
ous Internet, computer, and electronic technology jobs, all su-
pervisory, management, and administrative positions in the 
business world are requiring proficiency in math. Low-paying 
service sector jobs are the best options for those with little or 
no math skill.”
	
“I know for a fact, doing math and math problems actually helps 
make me smarter. My thinking is so much clearer. I analyze 
situations I encounter in life better and I end up figuring out 
the best thing to do. In fact, my stock portfolio has doubled 
because of it!”
	
“Math describes what is going on around us. It answers why 
things do what they do.”
	
“Algebra has helped me find out how much money I can put away 
today at the current interest rate to have a down payment on 
a new house in 5 years.”
	
“Algebra has helped me in my nutrition major. For example, I 
needed it for an assignment where I was to provide nutri-
tious meals for a family of four, using tables listing the pro-
tein, fat, cholesterol, carbohydrate, vitamin, and mineral 
content in quantities per gram, when the food I purchase is 
in pounds.”
	
“I use algebra all the time. Just in the last few months, it has 
given me answers to: Should I buy whole life vs. term life in-
surance? Is a 4-year optional service contract on my new CD 
player really a good deal? How many cubic yards of fertilizer 
did I need for my vegetable garden? How much paint did I 
need to paint my living room and bedroom? Which interest 
loan on my car was the best deal?”
	
“Algebra forces you to think on your own, to become a critical 
thinker and a problem solver.”
	
“Math is the language of choice for physics, chemistry, astronomy, 
geology, biology, psychological research and statistics, business 
and finance, electronics, computer programming, accounting, 
economics, and many other fields. Without it, you cannot 
begin to understand or describe these fields. With a basic un-
derstanding of this ‘language,’ you can begin to make sense of 
these subjects. Knowing just the basics opens many doors that 
would otherwise be closed.”

196    C H A P T E R   1 1  
	
“Algebra is the steppingstone for many higher-level science and 
math courses. It is analogous to learning to walk before run-
ning. Algebra gives us the beginning tools needed to solve 
many applied problems.”
Today’s Lucrative, Exciting Careers
William “Bill” Schrader, chairman of the board and CEO of PSINet, a 
commercial Internet service provider, knows how important math is 
in achieving success in today’s technological world. In an interview, 
he was asked, “What are the most important aspects of mathematics 
needed in the workforce?” He responded, “It is really the ability to 
think and to imagine how to solve a problem . . . Everything comes 
down to mathematics . . . If employees turn out to be good problem 
solvers, then they progress rather rapidly—they can do anything, 
whether it’s in sales, accounting, technology.”
	
Whether you realize it or not, an understanding of mathemati-
cal problem-solving and reasoning ability is necessary to enter and 
advance in most jobs and careers. The National Research Council 
(NRC) reports 75% of all jobs require proficiency in basic algebra 
or geometry as a prerequisite for licensure or training. In addition, 
more than three-quarters of the nation’s university degree programs 
require more advanced math such as calculus, discrete math, statis-
tics, or comparable mathematics. An advanced level of math compe-
tence is one of the essential elements for comprehending the math-
ematical basis for the sciences, engineering, technology, computer 
programming, and business. Moreover, most, if not all, technical jobs 
require computer skills, and these in turn are largely dependent on 
math skills or mathematical thought processes. As with all graduate 
programs, math competence is a prerequisite for entering medical 
school. Beyond college algebra, trigonometry, and calculus, medical 
students must also have working knowledge of statistics, the major 
underpinning of all medical research. Students who avoid taking 
math are shut out of these lucrative career options. Please don’t al-
low this to happen to you.
	
I often ask students who are overcoming math fears to complete 
this incomplete sentence: “If I were better in math _____.” These are 
just a few of the responses I’ve received:

Math Is the Future   197
	
I’d be a Web designer.
	
I’d be an engineer.
	
I’d get a better job.
	
I’d be a financial planner.
	
I’d get my B.A. degree.
	
I’d be a doctor.
	
I’d finally pass the civil service exam.
	
I’d become a scientist.
	
I’d do better on the GRE and get into graduate school.
	
I’d pass the advancement exam for my job.
	
I’d feel great about myself and my future.
	
You needn’t let math hold you back. I encourage you to continue 
to practice the strategies in this workbook and to follow your dreams. 
Don’t close the doors on the exciting careers of today and the future. 
You can succeed in math; you are a winner.

Enjoy Greater Academic Success
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) finds stu-
dents who progress through mathematics are more likely to succeed 
in their education than those who avoid it. A study by the College 
Board shows math as an important monitor of academic success in 
college. Math is “the great equalizer” between high-income students 
and those who are disadvantaged, of a minority, or have low income. 

Math Is the Future   199
The gap between these two groups in terms of their persistence and 
attendance in pursuit of a college degree essentially disappears when 
the latter group masters algebra and geometry in high school.
Score Higher on Exams
Many students who’ve overcome math anxiety find their math knowl-
edge and positive attitude help on important tests. Craig, a psychol-
ogy major, recently applied for a position with a large department 
store’s online catalog division. He was required to take a preemploy-
ment assessment exam testing his math and problem-solving skills. 
He was nervous, as were the other applicants waiting for the exam to 
begin. While in the waiting room, Craig practiced the Deep Abdomi-
nal Breathing exercise described in Chapter 3 (and recorded on track 
three of the CD accompanying this book). During the assessment, he 
remained calm, self-assured, and confident. Not surprisingly, Craig 
did well on the test and got the job.
	
Poovi, a mid-level manager at a major industrial plant, returned 
to school part-time with the sole purpose of improving her math 
skills. Although she tried eight times, she was unable to pass her 
company’s internal promotion exam, which stressed math and logical 
sequential patterning skills. After taking a few semesters of math, 
Poovi passed her company’s test and was promoted. She is now the 
vice president of internal operations, earning a quite respectable six-
figure salary.
	
The study of mathematics provides excellent preparation for 
advancement in many careers and jobs. According to the Institute 
of Education’s research report entitled “Standardized Test Scores of 
College Graduates,” mathematics majors have ranked the highest 
in test performance for the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and 
the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). High school 
students already know the important role of math for the Standard 
Achievement Test (SAT). But did you know training in mathemat-
ics also ensures you greater success on the Graduate Record Exam 
(GRE), an exam required by most universities for entrance into 
graduate programs?

People who don’t count won’t count. —Anatole France
Because math is essential in engineering, business, science, econom-
ics, and all technological fields, individuals who enter these disci-
plines with a good grasp of mathematical concepts and reasoning 
ability have a greater likelihood of succeeding and progressing up 
the career ladder. There is a positive correlation between people’s fu-
ture income and both the number of math courses they take and how 
well they do in those courses.
	
Bachelor’s degrees in engineering and computer science require 
several semesters of advanced mathematics beyond college algebra. 
Of all the degrees a student can receive at the undergraduate level, 
these are among the highest paying fields one can enter. Recent 
graduates in electrical and electronic engineering are receiving job 
offers with salaries starting at $55,000. Computer science graduates 
are in such high demand their starting salaries are even higher. Ac-
cording to Robert Half International, computer science job applicants 
may expect to be offered the following starting salaries:
	
database administrators	
$70,000 to $88,000
	
network administrators	
$43,000 to $62,500
	
network security administrators

Math in the 21st Century
I was in college before I realized that mathematics is not cold. Mathemat-
ics is not like a piece of colorless cold marble—it has feeling, it has a 
warm temperature; mathematics has a beauty; it has a pulse; it has a 
heartbeat. —Bill Cosby, “Math: Who Needs It?” (PBS Video)

Math Is the Future   201
Not only is change an inescapable part of our lives, but the rate of 
change is accelerating at a prodigious pace. Change will continue 
unabated in the 21st century. A working knowledge of math is an 
indispensable survival skill. In this section, we’ll explore major areas

Summary
Math is the one constant in all sciences’ efforts to understand, manip-
ulate, and control natural phenomena. But beyond its necessity in sci-
ence, mathematics is essential in all aspects of our lives. This ­chapter 
explored the importance of math in training us to think clearly. It an-
swered the question “Why study math?” It also showed us that math 
can open doors to lucrative career opportunities, greater academic 
success, and higher scores on entrance and job placement exams. We 
also examined the applications of math in science, technology, trans-
portation, weather, health issues, home entertainment and computer 
systems, civic issues, finance, leisure time, music, art, and culture.
	
Congratulations! You have arrived. You have completed the major 
steppingstones along the road to math achievement. You’ve made a 
commitment to succeed. You are a winner!
