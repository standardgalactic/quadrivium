About the Author
I might as well use this space to tell you about myself on the off chance that
anyone actually reads it. After suffering through post-traumatic stress disorder
after working for General Dynamics for 1.5 years and Cubic Corporation for
another 2 years (where I can count my contributions to making the world a
better place on one amputated, missing finger), I soon fled the world of
Department of Defense contractors to the sanctuary of the personal computer
market, where I was fortunate enough to make a living writing computer 
magazine articles and books.
I’ve written several dozen computer books, most of which are out of print
(unless someone still wants a book teaching them about the joys of Turbo
Pascal programming or how to write macros in WordPerfect 5.0 for DOS). While
spending most of my adult life covering the rise and fall of the computer indus-
try, I noticed a pattern. Every computer company that was the leader in its field
would eventually mess up by failing to update its product for several years and
then finally churn out a shoddy update that drove their customers en masse to
a rival, thereby turning the rival into the new leader of that particular category.
This happened when WordStar failed to update its word processor for four
years and finally cranked out an incompatible version (called WordStar 2000)
that everyone hated, thereby causing people to flock to WordPerfect instead.
WordPerfect promptly fumbled the ball when it failed to update its product to
run on Windows, which let Microsoft Word take over from there.
The same situation occurred again in the database market when dBASE 
took too long to issue an update and when it did, the update turned out to 
be the buggy dBASE IV that everyone hated, which caused everyone to switch
to Paradox. Like WordPerfect, Paradox fumbled the ball by not creating a
Windows version, which allowed Microsoft Access to take over the database
market.
That’s when I noticed that Microsoft was fumbling the ball in the operating
system market. After failing to update its operating system for five years, it
promptly issued a buggy (like dBASE IV) and incompatible (like WordStar 2000)
version dubbed Vista. One look at Vista made me realize that history was about
to repeat itself and Vista would soon be the main reason people would crown 
a new leader in the operating system category. After ruling out competitors like
Linux, I realized that the next leader of the personal computer market could
only be Mac OS X.
So that’s when I became a complete Mac user, dumping Windows XP (and 
my free copy of Vista) in favor of learning and mastering the Macintosh. That’s
who I am today: a devoted Mac user who has realized that the Mac is the 
future of the personal computer market because the Mac is reliable, easy to
use, and most importantly, fun to use as well. Not that anyone cares what 
I think, though.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to all those long-suffering Windows users who have
switched over to the Mac and discovered that it’s possible to buy and use 
a computer that actually works. 
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book could never have been written without the invention of the print-
ing press, so thank you, Johannes Gutenberg! On a more contemporary level,
a big thanks goes out to Bill Gladstone and Margot Hutchison at Waterside
Productions. Of course, if they weren’t my agents, they would have just
gotten someone else to write this book and you’d see a different name 
plastered across the cover.
Another big round of thanks goes to the whole, happy crew at Wiley
Publishing for turning this project into reality: Bob Woerner for entrusting 
me with the massive Mac tome you have in your hands; Paul Levesque for
keeping this whole project together; Dennis Cohen for helping me make the
transition from the world of Windows to the much better world of the Mac;
and Virginia Sanders for editing, revising, and correcting what I wrote so 
I don’t wind up looking like an idiot. 
I also want to acknowledge all the stand-up comedians I’ve met, who 
have made those horrible crowds at comedy clubs more bearable: Darrell
Joyce (http://darrelljoyce.com), Leo “the Man, the Myth, the Legend”
Fontaine, Chris Clobber, Bob Zany (www.bobzany.com), Russ Rivas (http://
russrivas.com), Don Learned, Dante, and Dobie “The Uranus King”
Maxwell. Another round of thanks goes to Steve Schirripa (who appeared 
in HBO’s hit show The Sopranos) for giving me my break in performing 
at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, one of the few old-time casinos
left that the demolition crews haven’t imploded (yet).
I’d also like to acknowledge the animals in my life who have played such a
large role in forcing me to buy paper towels, liquid cleaners, and air freshen-
ers: Bo, Scraps, Tasha, and Nuit (my cats) and Ollie and Loons (two birds
who live with my sister because if they lived with me, they would have long
ago become meals for Bo, Scraps, Tasha, or Nuit). 
Finally, I’d like to acknowledge Cassandra (my wife) and Jordan (my son) for
putting up with my long hours and my insistence that everyone dump their
Windows XP PCs right away (an easy decision since they never worked right
anyway) and migrate completely to the Mac.

Introduction
W
hether you’re a beginner, an intermediate user, or a seasoned
computer expert, you can find something in Macs All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies for you. This book is divided into several minibooks
so you can focus on the topics that interest you and skip over the rest.
Eventually, you’ll need more detailed explanations on specific topics than
this book can provide (that’s when you should look into a more specialized
For Dummies book), but if you need a quick introduction to get you started
on a variety of topics related to using a Mac, this book can answer your ques-
tions, steer you in the right direction, and lead you gently on your way. 
This book focuses on the basics for using all aspects of a Mac, from just
turning it on and using the mouse to connecting your Mac in a network to
organizing your digital pictures and videos to create photo albums and
home movies with fancy Hollywood-style effects to . . . you get the idea.
This book even shows you how to use and take advantage of Apple’s new
iWork suite, which provides word processing and desktop publishing, pres-
entation software, and a spreadsheet program for calculating formulas and
displaying your data as 3-D charts. Whether you need a Mac for work,
school, or just for fun, you’ll find that, with the right software, your Mac can
definitely meet your needs. 
If you’re migrating to a Mac from another computer — you ex-Windows folks
know who you are — this book can show you several ways to run your
favorite Windows program on a Mac. By running Windows on a Mac, you
can basically get two computers in one.
If you’re new to the Mac, you’ll find this book introduces you to all the main
features of using a Mac. If you’re already a Mac user, you’re sure to find
information on topics you might not know much about. By reading this
book, you’ll have the foundation and confidence to move on to more
advanced books. 
You might not become a Mac expert after reading this book, but you will

About This Book
Don’t be afraid of this book because of its hefty bulk. You probably won’t
need (or want) to read this whole thing from cover to cover, and that’s fine.
Think of this book more as a reference like an encyclopedia or a dictionary
than a step-by-step instruction manual that requires you to read every page.
To help you find just the information you need, this book is divided into sev-
eral minibooks where each minibook tackles a specific topic independent of
the other minibooks. Any time you have questions, just flip to the minibook
that covers that particular topic. 
Each minibook gives you a quick introduction to a specific topic, and then it
teaches you the basics to doing something right away. After you find the
answers you need, you can put this hefty book back on your bookshelf to get
it out of the way so you can get some work done on your Mac.
How to Use This Book
Given the weight of this book, you can use it both as a reference and a
weapon that you can throw at unwanted visitors trying to steal office sup-
plies from your desk. If you’re completely new to the Mac (or even comput-
ers in general), read this book starting with the first minibook and then pick
the next minibook that interests you, such as how to use iLife or how to use
the Mac’s user interface. 
If you’re already an experienced Mac user, feel free to browse the minibooks
that interest you. If you know nothing about a particular topic, such as net-
working your Macs, you might want to read that minibook in more detail. If
you already know about a particular topic, browse through the minibook
that covers that topic anyway. You just might find a shortcut or tip that you
never knew about before.
Although the Mac is easy to use, it’s also easy to get used to one way of
using your Mac and never take the time to explore other ways to accomplish
the same task (that might be faster) or other ways to use your Mac that you
might never have thought about before. 
So use this book as a reference, a brief introduction to different features, and
a guide to help you discover different ways you can use your Mac.

How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into seven separate minibooks. Here’s a brief descrip-
tion of what you can find in each minibook:
Book I: Mac Basics
This minibook explains everything you need to know just to use your Mac,
such as how to turn it on and off, how to use the mouse and keyboard, and
how to use the Mac user interface. Even if you’re already familiar with using
a Mac, you might want to skim through this minibook just to pick up tidbits
of information you might not know about. 
Book II: Photos, Music, and Movies
More people are using computers to store more than just numbers and text,
so this minibook explains how to use your Mac to store and organize digital
photographs, audio files of your favorite songs, and digital movies. This is
where you discover not only how to store this information on your Mac, but
also how to modify it. 
Book III: Browsing the Internet
This minibook explains how to connect your Mac to the Internet and what
you can do after you’re connected. This minibook will teach you the basics
of using the Safari Web browser and using e-mail with the Mail program
along with explaining how to use video conferencing, design your own Web
pages, and protect your Mac from online security threats such as junk e-mail
and malicious software like viruses and Trojan horses.
Book IV: Working with iLife and iWork
Computers are only as useful as the software they can run, so this minibook
explains how to use the iLife suite (for having fun with your Mac) and the
iWork suite (for doing productive work with your Mac). This minibook is
where you find out how to store and organize digital pictures and digital
videos. If you want to write reports, create presentations, or crunch num-
bers, you find out how to do that here too.

Book V: Other Mac Programs
With the right software, your Mac can do practically anything, so this mini-
book introduces you to the variety of programs (many of which are free) for
doing everything from painting and drawing to playing games to creating
documents with word processors and desktop publishing programs. This
minibook also shows you how to use special software to make your Mac run
Windows programs so you’ll be able to use practically any program you want.
Book VI: Time-Saving Tips with a Mac
This minibook explains how to make the most of your Mac, from backing up
your crucial files to using the variety of free programs on your Mac to organ-
ize your thoughts or jot down your ideas. You even discover how to store
names and addresses, track appointments, and automate your Mac so it can
do your work for you while you’re away from your computer.
Book VII: Mac Networking
This minibook explains what you need to know in order to set up a network
of Mac computers. This is where you can find out how to share hard drives,
folders, and printers with other Mac computers.
Icons Used in This Book
To help emphasize certain information, this book displays different icons in
the page margins. 
This icon identifies a shortcut that can save you time or make accomplishing
a specific task much easier.
This icon highlights interesting information that isn’t necessary to know but
can help explain why certain things work the way they do on the Mac. Feel
free to skip this information if you’re in a hurry, but browse through this
information when you have time. You might find out something interesting
that can help you use your Mac.
Watch out! This icon highlights something that can go terribly wrong if
you’re not careful, such as wiping out your important files or messing up
your Mac. Make sure you read any Warning information before following any
instructions.

Where to Go from Here

This icon points out some useful information that isn’t quite as important as
a Tip, but not as threatening as a Warning. If you ignore this information, you
can’t hurt your files or your Mac, but you might miss something useful.
Where to Go from Here
If you already know what type of help you need, jump right to that particular
minibook and start reading. If you just want to know more about your Mac, feel
free to skip around and browse through any minibook that catches your eye. 
For starters, you might want to begin with Book I and find out about the
basics of using your Mac in detail. This first minibook will likely show you
new or different ways to do something and help you fully take control of
your Mac. 
No matter what your experience is with the Mac, don’t be afraid to explore
and keep making new discoveries. As you expand your horizons, you’ll find
out that the capabilities of your Mac expand right along with your own grow-
ing knowledge. If you know what you want to do, your Mac can probably
help you do it, and this book can show you how.

E
veryone knows that the Macintosh (Mac, for short) is the easiest computer
to use in the world. Just plug in a Mac, turn it on, and you’re ready to go,
which is the way computers are supposed to work. 
Besides being easy to use, the Mac is also dependable and durable. When
you use a Mac, you probably won’t have to buy a new Mac because you
have to, but because you want to.
Despite the Mac’s legendary reputation for being easy to use, you might find
the Mac slightly different from other computers you’ve used before. So to help
you understand the way your Mac works, take a few moments to understand
the different types of Macs available.
Different Macintosh Models
The Macintosh has been around since 1984, and since that time, Apple has
produced a wide variety of Mac models. Although you can still find and use
older Macs, chances are good that if you buy a newer Mac, it will fall into
one of three categories:
✦All-in-one desktop (iMac)
✦Laptop (MacBook or MacBook Pro)
✦“Headless” Mac (Mac Mini or Mac Pro)
The original Mac came with a built-in screen, which gave the Mac the
appearance of a “head.” So any Mac model that doesn’t come with a built-in
screen is often referred to as a “headless” Mac. 

Different Macintosh Models
10
By understanding the particular type of Mac you have and its capabilities,
you’ll have a better idea of what your Mac can do. 
No matter what the capabilities of your Mac are, chances are good that it will
work reliably for as long as you own it. Remember, things could be worse.
You could be stuck using a Windows computer. 
The iMac
The all-in-one design of the iMac is an evolutionary extension of the original —
1984-era — Mac design. The iMac combines the computer with a built-in monitor
and speakers. (On some iMac models, it’s possible to connect a second external
monitor if you want.) 
The advantage of the all-in-one design of the iMac is that you have everything
you need in a single unit. The disadvantage is that if one part of your iMac
fails (such as the monitor), you can’t easily replace the failed part.
The MacBook and MacBook Pro
The two portable Mac laptop computers, the MacBook and the MacBook
Pro, are the most popular Macintosh models. Both models combine the all-
in-one design into a compact, lightweight unit that runs off batteries or
external power. If you need to take your Mac everywhere you go, you can
choose between the consumer MacBook model and the professional
MacBook Pro model.
Previous versions of the MacBook were called the iBook, and previous ver-
sions of the MacBook Pro were called the PowerBook.
The main difference between the two Mac laptops is price and performance.
For the lower price of the MacBook, you get a laptop designed for ordinary
uses such as word processing, browsing the Internet, and playing simple
games such as chess. For the higher price of the MacBook Pro, you get a
faster laptop, larger display, bigger hard drive, and higher performance
graphics capabilities designed for professional uses such as video and audio
editing or playing the latest 3-D video games. 
Another difference is that the MacBook and MacBook Pro include a con-
densed version of the regular keyboard and use a trackpad instead of a
mouse, so you can slide your fingertip across the trackpad to move the
cursor on the screen. 
If you find the keyboard or trackpad of your laptop Mac too clumsy to use,
you can always plug an external keyboard and mouse into your laptop.

Understanding Mac Processors

The Mac Mini and Mac Pro
The biggest advantages of both the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro are that you
can choose the type of monitor to use and you can place them anywhere you
want on your desk as long as you have a cable that can reach the monitor.
The Mac Mini, in particular, is small enough to hide under your desk or in a
corner of your desk. 
The Mac Mini is the lower-priced, consumer version designed for people
who want an inexpensive Mac for ordinary uses such as word processing
and writing and sending e-mail. The Mac Pro is a much higher-priced, profes-
sional version with greater graphics and processing capabilities due to its
dedicated graphics processor and use of multiple processors. 
Understanding Mac Processors
If you’re going to write the history of the Mac, you’ll probably divide it into
three eras. The first Macs used processors from the 68000 series, which
served Macs well from 1984 to about 1994. Then came the PowerPC era,
which lasted from about 1994 to 2005. Now, fast forward to the present,
where Macs use processors made by a company called Intel. If you have an
older Mac, it might use a PowerPC or Intel processor. If you just bought a
new Mac, it has an Intel processor. 
If you’re still using a Mac that uses the 68000 processor, you’re using an
antique 1980’s era computer that might be valuable for historical purposes,
but it won’t be capable of running any of today’s software, including the Mac
OS X operating system. 
The processor basically acts as the brain of your Mac. A computer is only as
powerful as the processor inside it. As a general rule, the newer your com-
puter, the newer its processor and the faster it will run. 
Apple stopped using PowerPC processors in 2005 and started using Intel
processors, which are the same type of processors used in many Windows
PCs. Not only were Intel processors less expensive than PowerPC proces-
sors, but they were more powerful as well. As a bonus, using Intel proces-
sors also gave the Mac the ability to run the Microsoft Windows operating
system (although some people might consider that a drawback). 
The type of processor used in your Mac can determine the type of software
your Mac can run. The three types of programs available are
✦PowerPC programs
✦Universal binaries
✦Intel programs

Understanding Mac Processors
12
Older Mac programs were designed to run only on Mac computers using the
PowerPC processor. However, all newer Mac computers that use Intel
processors can also run PowerPC programs by using a built-in feature called
Rosetta. When you run a PowerPC program on an Intel Mac, Rosetta tricks
the program into thinking it’s actually running on a PowerPC processor. As a
result, all Intel Macs can run nearly all software originally designed for
PowerPC Macs.
PowerPC programs tend to run slower on an Intel Mac than on a PowerPC Mac
due to the memory and processor resources needed by the Rosetta program. 
Most programs now advertise themselves as universal binaries, which means
they’re designed to run on both PowerPC and Intel processors. Before you
buy any software, make sure it can run on your computer. If it’s a universal
binary, it can run equally well on both PowerPC and Intel Macs.
Because Macs are no longer using the PowerPC processor, it’s only a matter
of time before almost everyone will be using an Intel Mac. That’s why some
companies are starting to write programs that run only on Intel Macs. If you
have a Mac that uses a PowerPC processor, eventually you won’t be able to
use the latest software available, so you’ll be forced to switch to an Intel Mac.
To identify the type of processor used in your Mac, click the Apple menu in
the upper-left corner of the screen and choose About This Mac. An About
This Mac window appears, listing your processor as either PowerPC or Intel,
as shown in Figure 1-1.
PowerPC and Intel processors represent a family of related processors. 
The PowerPC family of processors includes the G3, G4, and G5 PowerPC
processors where the G3 is the slowest and the G5 the fastest. The Intel
family of processors includes the Core Solo, Core Duo, Core 2 Duo, and Xeon,
where the Core Solo is the slowest and the Xeon is the fastest. Every processor

can also run at a specific speed, so a 2.0 gigahertz (GHz) Core 2 Duo proces-
sor will be slower than a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo processor. If understanding
processor types and gigahertz confuses you, just remember that the most
expensive computer is usually the fastest.
Identifying the Parts of Your Mac
Just by looking at your Mac, you can tell whether it’s an all-in-one design
(iMac), a laptop (MacBook or MacBook Pro), or a “headless” unit that lacks a
built-in screen (Mac Mini or Mac Pro). However, looking at the outside of
your Mac can’t tell you the parts used on the inside. To identify the parts
and capabilities of your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and
choose About This Mac.
An About This Mac window appears (refer to Figure 1-1).
2. Click More Info.
A System Profiler window appears.
3. Click the Hardware option in the Contents category pane on the left
to view a list of hardware items.
If the list of hardware items (such as Bluetooth, Memory, and USB)
already appears under the Hardware category, skip this step.
4. Click a hardware item such as Memory or Disc Burning.
The right pane of the System Profiler window displays the capabilities of
your chosen hardware, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Don’t worry if the information displayed in the System Profiler window
doesn’t make much sense to you right now. The main idea here is to
figure out a quick way to find out about the capabilities of your Mac.
Then you can pick through the technical details to find the parts that
you understand and search the Internet to look up the details you don’t
understand.
5. When you’re done scouting out the contents of the System Profiler
window, choose System Profiler➪Quit System Profiler from the main
menu to close the window.

Identifying the Parts of Your Mac
14
If you’re going to look at anything in System Profiler window, check out Disc
Burning and Graphics/Displays under the Hardware option:
✦Disc Burning tells you all about your DVD/CD–burning hardware, includ-
ing general info about all the different types of CDs and DVDs that your
Mac can read and write to, so you’ll know exactly which type to buy.
✦Graphics/Displays tells you whether your Mac has a separate graphics
card, as seen in the VRAM category (Video RAM). If you see the word
shared in the VRAM category, your Mac doesn’t have a separate graphics
card and shares the main memory, which means its graphics capabilities
will (usually) be slower than a Mac that does have a separate graphics
card. If you do not see the word shared, the VRAM category simply lists
the amount of memory used by the separate graphics card. The more
memory, the better your graphics capabilities.
If you have a Mac Pro, you have the option of replacing your graphics card
with a better one. If you have any other type of Mac (iMac, MacBook,
MacBook Pro, or Mac Mini), you’re pretty much stuck with the graphics
capabilities built into your Mac.

efore you can use your Mac, you have to start it up — which makes
perfect sense. Now, get ready for the counterintuitive part. After
you’ve got your Mac up and running, you should just leave it on. Although
you might cringe at the idea of leaving your Mac on when you’re not using it,
the Mac performs basic housekeeping chores on its hard drive early every
morning to keep its files neat and tidy. Don’t worry about wasting electric-
ity; the Mac is smart enough to put itself into a low-energy mode — Sleep
mode, to be precise — when not in use so it burns up a minimum of energy. 
Only if you plan on being away from your Mac for an extended period of
time, such as a week or more, should you turn off your Mac completely. If
you’re going to use your Mac the next morning or Monday after a weekend,
leave it on and let it sleep instead.
Starting Your Mac
Here’s the simple way to start up your Mac — the way you’ll probably use
99 percent of the time:
1. Press the power button.
That’s it. Depending on the type of Mac you have, the power button might
be in back (Mac Mini and some iMacs), front (Mac Pro and some iMacs), or
above the keyboard (on laptop models like the MacBook and MacBook Pro).
As soon as you press the power button, your Mac plays a musical chime to
let you know that it’s starting up. (Techie types say “booting up,” a term
derived from the phrase “to lift yourself up by the bootstraps.”)

Starting Your Mac
16
The moment electricity starts coursing through your Mac, its electronic
brain immediately looks for instructions permanently embedded inside a
special Read-Only Memory (or ROM) chip. While your computer is reading
these instructions (also known as firmware), it displays a big gray Apple logo
on the screen to let you know that the computer is working and hasn’t for-
gotten about you.
The firmware instructions tell the computer to check all of its different parts
to make sure everything’s working. If some part of your computer is physi-
cally defective, such as a memory chip, your computer will stop right there.
Unless you know something about repairing the physical parts of a
Macintosh, this is the time to haul your Mac to the nearest repair shop.
Sometimes a Mac might refuse to start up correctly due to software problems.
To fix software problems, check out Book I, Chapter 9, which explains how to
perform basic troubleshooting on a Mac.
After your computer determines that all its different parts are working, the
last set of instructions on the chip tells the computer, “Now that you know
all your parts are working, load an operating system.”
When you unpack your Mac and turn it on for the very first time, it will ask
that you type your name and make up a password to create an account for
using your Mac. To guide you through the process of setting up a Mac for the
first time, a special program called the Setup Assistant runs, and it asks for
information such as the current time zone, the current date, and whether
you want to transfer files and programs from another Mac to your newer
one. You also have go through this procedure if you reinstall your operating
system. Normally, you need to run through this initial procedure only once.
The most important part of this initial procedure is remembering the password
you chose because you’ll need this password to log into your account or install
new software.
An operating system is the program that controls your computer and is
usually stored on the computer’s hard drive. On the Mac, the operating
system is called Mac OS X (which stands for “Macintosh Operating System
number ten”) followed by a version number such as 10.5. 
After the operating system loads, you can start using your computer to run
other programs so you can write a letter, browse the Internet, balance your
checkbook, or play a game. (You know, all the things you bought your Mac
for in the first place.)

Putting a Mac in Sleep Mode
After you’ve turned on your Mac, don’t keep turning it on and off whenever
you aren’t using it. To save time and prevent wear and tear on your computer,
put your Mac into Sleep mode instead. When you put your Mac to sleep, it
shuts down every part of your computer, and the computer runs on a bare
minimum of power. When you touch the keyboard or click the mouse button,
the computer wakes up so you can use it right away.
To put your Mac to sleep, you have a choice of doing it manually or automat-
ically. When you need to be away from your Mac for a short period of time
(going to the restroom), you might want to put your Mac to sleep manually.
If you suddenly get called to attend a meeting and don’t have time to put
your Mac to sleep manually, you might want your Mac to put itself to sleep
automatically.
Putting a Mac in Sleep mode manually
To put your Mac to sleep manually, choose one of the following two actions:
✦Choose Ú➪Sleep.
✦Press the Control+Eject (or press the power button) and, when a dialog
appears as shown in Figure 2-1, click the Sleep button.
The Ú menu appears in the upper-left corner of the screen.
If you have a laptop, a faster way to put your Mac to sleep is just to close its
lid. When a laptop is sleeping, you can safely move it.
To wake up a sleeping Mac, just click the mouse button or tap any key. To
keep from accidentally typing any characters into any currently running pro-
gram, press a noncharacter key such as one of the arrow keys.

Putting a Mac in Sleep mode automatically
Because you can’t always plan how long you might be away from your Mac,
you can also make your Mac put itself in Sleep mode automatically after a
fixed period of time — say, ten minutes or so. That way, if your Mac doesn’t
detect any keyboard or mouse activity within that fixed period of time, your
computer will put itself into Sleep mode automatically. 
To make your computer go to sleep automatically, you need to define the
following:
✦The inactivity time
✦The parts of your computer to put into Sleep mode
The inactivity time defines how long your computer waits before putting
itself into Sleep mode. This time can be as short as one minute or as long as
three hours. The shorter you define the inactivity period, the more often
your Mac might suddenly go to sleep while you’re just staring at the screen. 
The two main parts of your computer that you can put into Sleep mode are
the hard drive and the display (your computer screen). Because the hard
drive and the display consume the most power, putting at least one or both
of these parts into Sleep mode can dramatically reduce the amount of power
your Mac consumes while it’s asleep.
To define how your Mac should put itself into Sleep mode automatically,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
A System Preferences window appears, as shown in Figure 2-2.

2. Click the Energy Saver icon (the light bulb) under the Hardware category.
An Energy Saver dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-3. (If you’re using a
desktop Mac, skip to Step 4.)
The Settings For pop-up menu lets you choose different energy saver
settings on a laptop when running off battery power and when plugged
into an electrical outlet. The Optimization pop-up menu lets you cus-
tomize the energy saver settings or just choose a predefined setting
such as Better Energy Savings, Normal, or Better Performance.
3. Click the Show Details button. 
The Energy Saver dialog expands to show you the computer and display
sliders, as shown in Figure 2-4.
4. Drag the Put the Computer to Sleep When It Is Inactive For slider to
any value between one minute and three hours. 
When the computer sleeps, the microprocessor in your Mac goes into a
special low-voltage mode. (If you never want your Mac to go to sleep,
drag the slider all the way to the right over the Never option.) 
5. Drag the Put the Display to Sleep When the Computer Is Inactive For
slider to any value between one minute and three hours. 
When the display sleeps, the video signal to the monitor is shut off. (If
you never want your display to go to sleep, drag the slider all the way to
the right over the Never option.)
6. Select (or deselect) the Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible
check box. 
When you put the hard drive to sleep, the hard drive stops spinning.
Because spinning a hard drive burns up energy and wears out your hard
drive, putting a hard drive to sleep can help the hard drive last longer.

At this point, you can click the Close button of the Energy Saver dialog
to save your energy saver changes. (The Close button is the little red
button in the upper left of the dialog.) If you want to define additional
options for waking up a sleeping Mac, such as remotely over a telephone
line or network, follow the remaining steps.
7. (Optional) Click the Options tab. 
The Options pane appears. 
If you have a desktop Mac, you see the pane shown in Figure 2-5. If you
have a laptop Mac, you see the pane shown in Figure 2-6.
8. Select (or deselect) one or more of the following check boxes. (Some
check boxes won’t appear, depending on the type of Mac you have.)
• Wake When the Modem Detects a Ring: Useful for remotely accessing
a Mac over the telephone line. (This option appears only if you have
a modem connected to your Mac.)
• Wake for Ethernet Network Administrator Access: Useful for letting a
network administrator access and configure a Mac over a network.
(Selected by default.)
• Allow Power Button to Sleep the Computer: Lets you put your Mac to
sleep by pressing the power button. (Selected by default. This option
appears only on desktop Mac computers.)
• Restart Automatically after a Power Failure: Makes your Mac restart if
its power gets abruptly cut off. (Deselected by default.)

Shutting Down a Mac

Shutting Down a Mac
If you won’t use your Mac for an extended period of time, you might want to
shut it off (although letting it sleep the entire time won’t hurt it either). You
actually have three ways to shut down a Mac:
✦Choose Ú➪Shut Down as shown in Figure 2-7. A dialog appears, asking
if you’re sure you want to shut down. (Refer to Figure 2-1.) Click Cancel
or Shut Down. (If you don’t click either option, your Mac will shut down
automatically after a few minutes.)
✦Press Control+Eject (or press the power button) and when a dialog
appears — the same one mentioned in the previous bullet point, 
actually — click the Shut Down button.
✦Press and hold the power button to force your Mac to shut down.
The third option, called a force shutdown, is used to force all running programs
to shut down right away. Generally, a force shutdown is handy if your entire
Mac suddenly freezes or hangs, making it unresponsive. If only a single 
program is freezing or acting flaky, it’s usually better to force quit that 
single program instead of shutting down your entire computer. (See Book I,
Chapter 4 for information about how to force quit a single program.)
Think of a force shutdown like taking a metal pipe and knocking your Mac
unconscious, whereas choosing Ú➪Shut Down or using the Control+
Eject/Power button option is like tucking your Mac into bed with a security
\if at all possible.
You can also force shutdown your Mac by pressing the Control+Option+
Ô+Eject keystroke combination.

Restarting a Mac
Sometimes the Mac can start acting sluggish, or programs might fail to run.
When that happens, you can turn off your computer and start it back up
again. This essentially clears your computer’s memory and starts it up fresh. 
Restarting a computer isn’t the same as turning the computer on and off,
which completely resets the computer. If you really want to make sure your
computer starts up correctly, turn it off, wait a few seconds, and then turn it
on again. If you’re in a hurry, try restarting your Mac, and if that doesn’t fix
the problem, you’ll have to turn it off and on again. 
To restart your computer, you have three choices:
✦Press the power button (or press Control+Eject) and, when a dialog
appears, click the Restart button (refer to Figure 2-1).
✦Choose Ú➪Restart.
✦Press Control+Ô+Eject (or Control+Ô+Power button).
Pressing the Control+Ô+Eject/Power button is the most reliable way to
restart a Mac because it doesn’t rely on the Mac OS X operating system. 
When you restart your computer, your Mac closes all running programs and
offers to save any files you’re be working on. After you choose to save any
files, your Mac will finally boot up again.

T
heoretically, using a computer is simple. In practice, using a computer
can cause people to suffer a wide range of emotions from elation to
sheer frustration and despair.
The problem with using a computer stems mostly from two causes:
✦Not knowing what the computer can do
✦Not knowing how to tell the computer what you want it to do
This communication gap between users and computers arises mostly from
ordinary people trying to use machines designed by engineers for other
engineers. If you don’t understand how a computer engineer thinks (or
doesn’t think), computers can seem nearly impossible to understand.
Fortunately, Apple has solved this problem with the Mac. Instead of design-
ing a computer for other computer engineers, Apple designed a computer
for ordinary people. And what do ordinary people want? Here’s the list:
✦Reliability
✦Ease of use
Not a long list, but definitely an important one. 
From a technical point of view, what makes the Mac reliable is its operating
system, Mac OS X. An operating system is nothing more than a program that
makes your computer actually work. 
By itself, an operating system works in the background. When you use a
computer, you’ll rarely see the operating system, but you will see its user
interface. The user interface is like a clerk at the front desk of a hotel. Instead

Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
26
of talking directly to the maid or the plumber (the operating system), you
always talk to the front desk clerk, and the clerk talks to the maid or
plumber. 
While other companies have been busy designing user interfaces that only
computer engineers can understand, Apple designed a user interface that
everyone can understand. Dubbed Aqua, Apple’s user interface puts the
friendly face on the Mac.
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
To control your Mac, you need to use the mouse (or trackpad on laptop
Macs) and the keyboard. Both the mouse (trackpad) and the keyboard can
choose commands, manipulate items on the screen, or create data such as
text or pictures.
To modify the mouse and keyboard, click the Apple menu in the upper-left
corner of the screen and choose System Preferences. Then click the
Keyboard & Mouse icon under the Hardware category.
The parts of the mouse
A typical mouse looks like a smooth bar of soap with one or more buttons
and a rubber wheel or ball in the middle. The main purpose of the mouse is
to move a pointer on the screen, which tells the computer, “See what I’m
pointing at right now? That’s what I want to select.”
Clicking, double-clicking, and dragging with the left mouse button
A mouse typically has one button on the left and one on the right. To select
an item on the screen, you must move the mouse to point at that item and
then press and release (click) the left mouse button.
✦Clicking (also called single-clicking): Moving the mouse and pressing
the left mouse button is the most common activity with a mouse. 
✦Double-clicking: If you point at something and click the left mouse
button twice in rapid succession (that is, you double-click it), you can
often select an item and open it at the same time. 
✦Dragging: Another common activity with the mouse is called dragging.
Dragging means pointing at an item on the screen, holding down the left
mouse button, moving the mouse, and then releasing the left mouse
button. Dragging is often used to move items on the screen.

Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
27
If you know how to point and click, double-click, and point and drag the
mouse, you’ve mastered the basics of controlling your Mac with a mouse.
Scrolling with the scroll wheel or ball
Many mice have a rubber wheel or ball embedded in the middle. By rolling
this wheel or ball, you can make items (such as text or a picture) scroll
up/down or right/left across the screen. Using the scroll wheel or ball can
make your Mac just a little bit easier to use.
Pointing and clicking with the right mouse button
Like the scroll wheel or ball, the right mouse button is optional but conven-
ient. Pointing the mouse and pressing the right mouse button is known as
right-clicking.
Right-clicking is commonly used to display a pop-up menu (often called a
contextual or shortcut menu) of commands to do something with the item
that the mouse is currently pointing at. For example, if you point at a mis-
spelled word, right-clicking that misspelled word can display a list of prop-
erly spelled words to choose from, as shown in Figure 3-1.
Some older mice (as well as some older laptop Mac computers) do not have
a right mouse button. To simulate a right-click, hold down the Control key
and click the lone mouse button (or hold down the Control key and click the
single trackpad button on laptop Mac computers). 
If you don’t like your mouse, you can always buy a replacement mouse.
Some mice are molded to better fit the shape of your hand, so find a mouse
that you like and plug it into the USB port of your Mac, or get a wireless
mouse that connects to your Mac through the Bluetooth wireless standard.
The parts of the keyboard
The primary use of the keyboard is to type in data. However, the keyboard
can also select items and menu commands — although not as easily as using
the mouse. The keyboard groups related keys together, as shown in Figure 3-2:
✦Function keys
✦Typewriter keys
✦Numeric keys
✦Arrow keys
✦Modifier keys
The next few sections cover each kind of key in greater detail.

Function keys
Depending on your particular keyboard, you might see 12 to 19 function keys
running along the top of the keyboard. These function keys are labeled F1
through F12/F19, along with an Escape key — brilliantly abbreviated “Esc” —
and an Eject key that looks like a triangle on top of a horizontal line. 
By default, every Mac has already assigned commands to the F8 through F12
function keys, as shown in Table 3-1.
Table 3-1
Mac Assigned Commands
Function Key
What It Does
F8
Displays thumbnail images of all workspaces
F9
Displays thumbnail images of all windows in a single 
workspace
F10
Displays all open windows of the currently active program 
(the program that has one of its windows on “top” of any 
other windows).
F11
Displays the Desktop
F12
Displays Dashboard
Pressing the F8 function key displays multiple workspaces defined by the
Spaces feature (which you find out more about in Book I, Chapter 4). 
The F9 through F11 function keys activate a feature on your Mac called
Exposé. Pressing F9 lets you see all the open windows currently running so
you can pick the one you want to use right now. Pressing F10 shows you all
windows that belong to the currently active program. (You can identify the
currently active program by looking for its name on the left side of the menu
bar.) Pressing F11 shoves all windows out of the way so you can see the
Desktop. 
Pressing F12 displays the Dashboard program and its widgets, which are
simple programs such as a calculator or calendar. (You find out more about
Dashboard in Book VI, Chapter 4.)
As for the other keys — F1 through F7 and (possibly) F13 through F19 —
these fellows won’t do much of anything in most programs. Because such
function keys are about as useful as wisdom teeth, laptop keyboards and the
latest Apple keyboards often assign hardware controls to these seldom-used
function keys. For example, pressing the F1 and F2 function keys might
change the brightness of the screen, whereas pressing other function keys
might adjust the volume.

Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
30
If it turns out that you have a program that actually puts one of these func-
tion keys to use meaning you really want to press the function key as a func-
tion key rather than as a way to control hardware stuff like monitor
brightness or speaker volume — you must first hold down the Fn key and
then press the function key you want. Holding down the Fn key tells your
Mac, “Ignore the hardware controls assigned to that function key and just
behave like a normal function key.”
Originally, function keys existed because some programs assigned commands
to different function keys. Unfortunately, every program assigned different
commands to identical function keys, which made function keys more con-
fusing than helpful. You can assign your own commands to different function
keys, but just remember that not every Mac will have the same commands
assigned to the same function keys. (Not everyone thinks exactly like you, as
amazing as that might seem.)
Turning to the two other keys grouped with the function keys, here’s what
you need to know. The Esc key often works as a “Get out of my way” com-
mand. For example, if a pull-down menu appears on the screen and you want
it to go away, press the Esc key. The Eject key is used to eject a CD or DVD
currently in your Mac.
Typewriter keys
You use the typewriter keys to create data — the typing-a-letter-in-a-word-
processor stuff or the entering-of-names-and-addresses-into-a-database stuff.
When you press a typewriter key, you’re telling the Mac which character to
type at the current position of the cursor, which often appears as a blinking
vertical line on the screen.
You can move the cursor by pointing to and clicking a new location with the
mouse or by pressing the arrow keys as explained later, in the section
“Arrow keys.”
One typewriter key that doesn’t type anything is the big Delete key that
appears to the right of the +/= key. This Delete key is used to delete any char-
acters that appear to the left of the cursor. If you hold down this Delete key,
your Mac will delete a bunch of characters to the left of the cursor.
Two other typewriter keys that don’t type anything are the Tab and Return
keys. The Tab key is often used to indent text in a word processor, but it can
also highlight different text boxes on the screen.
The Return key moves the cursor to the next line in a word processor, but
can also choose a default button (which appears in blue) on the screen. The
default button in the Print dialog is labeled Print, and the default button in
the Save dialog is labeled Save. 

Book I
Chapter 3
Getting Acquainted
with the Mac 
User Interface
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
31
Numeric keys
The numeric keys appear on the right side of the keyboard and arrange the
numbers 0 through 9 in rows and columns like a typical calculator keypad.
The main use for the numeric keys is to make typing numbers faster and
easier than using the numeric keys on the top row of the typewriter keys. 
On laptop keyboards, the numeric keys are buried in the normal typewriter
keys. To switch the numeric keys on, you have to press the Num Lock key.
To switch the numeric keys off, press the Num Lock key again. 
Arrow keys
The cursor often appears as a vertical blinking line and acts like a pointer.
Wherever the cursor appears, that’s where your next character will appear if
you press a typewriter key. You can move the cursor with the mouse, or you
can move it with the arrow keys. 
The up arrow moves the cursor up, the down arrow moves the cursor down,
the right arrow moves the cursor right, and the left arrow moves the cursor
left. (Could it be any more logical?) Depending on the program you’re using,
pressing an arrow key might move the cursor in different ways. For example,
pressing the right arrow key in a word processor moves the cursor right one
character, but pressing that same right arrow key in a spreadsheet might
move the cursor to the adjacent cell on the right. 
Four additional cursor control keys are labeled Home, End, Page Up, and
Page Down. Typically, the Page Up key scrolls up one screen, whereas the
Page Down key scrolls down one screen. Many programs ignore the Home
and End keys, but some programs let you move the cursor with them. For
example, Microsoft programs typically use the Home key to move the cursor
to the beginning of a line or row and the End key to move the cursor to the
end of a line or row.
To the left of the End key, you might find a smaller Delete key. Like the bigger
Delete key, this smaller Delete key also deletes characters one at a time. 
The big Delete key erases characters to the left of the cursor. The small
Delete key erases characters to the right of the cursor.
Modifier keys
The modifier keys are almost never used by themselves. Instead, modifier
keys are usually held down while tapping another key. The four modifier keys
are Shift, Control (Ctrl), Option, and Ô (Command).
If you press the S key, your Mac types the letter “s” on the screen, but if you
hold down a modifier key, such as the Command key (Ô) and then press the

Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
32
S key, the S key is modified to behave differently. In this case, holding down
the Ô key followed by the S key (abbreviated as Ô+S) tells your Mac to issue
its Save command.
Most modifier keystrokes involve pressing two keys, such as Ô+Q (the Quit
command), but some modifier keystrokes can involve pressing three or four
keys such as Shift+Ô+3, which saves the current screen image as a file. 
The main use for modifier keys is to help you choose commands quickly
without fumbling with the mouse. Every program includes dozens of such
keystroke shortcuts, but Table 3-2 lists the common keystroke shortcuts that
work in most programs.

Instead of describing the modifier keys to press by name (such as Shift),
most keystroke shortcuts displayed on menus use cryptic graphics. Figure
3-4 displays the different symbols you’ll find as shortcut commands. 
Some people love the keyboard that comes with their Mac, but others feel
that it’s too soft and squishy, like touching the belly of an animal. If you want
a more solid-feeling keyboard that provides more tactile feedback, check out
the Tactile Pro 2 keyboard (www.matias.ca/tactilepro2).
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
The Mac user interface acts like a communication pathway between you and
the operating system and serves three purposes:
✦To display all the options that you can choose
✦To display information
✦To accept commands 
One of the most crucial parts of the Mac user interface is a program called
the Finder, which displays a window that lets you manipulate files stored on
your Mac. You find out more about the Finder later in this chapter. 
The menu bar
The menu bar provides a single location where you can find nearly every
possible command you might need. Think of the menu bar like the menu of a
restaurant. Any time you want to order another dish, you can look at the
menu to see what’s available. Likewise, when using a Mac, you always know
the menu bar will appear at the top of the screen. The menu bar consists of
three parts, as shown in Figure 3-5:
✦The Apple menu
✦The Application menu
✦Menulets (Icons)
Figure 3-4:
A keystroke
command
symbol
guide.

Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
34
The Apple menu always appears on the menu bar and gives you one-click
access to commands for controlling or modifying your Mac. The Application
menu displays the name of the currently active program along with several
menus that contain commands for controlling that particular program and
its data. (If you don’t run any additional programs, your Mac always runs the
Finder program, which you find out more about in this chapter.)
Menulets act like miniature menus that perform a single function, such as
adjusting the volume or displaying the current time. Clicking a menulet dis-
plays a small pull-down menu or control, as shown in Figure 3-6.
If you don’t want a menulet cluttering up the menu bar, you can remove it by
holding down the Ô key, moving the pointer over the menulet you want to
remove, dragging (moving) the mouse off the menu bar, and then releasing
the mouse button. 
Understanding menu commands 
Each menu on the menu bar contains a group of related commands. The File
menu contains commands for opening, saving, and printing files, whereas the
Edit menu contains commands for copying or deleting items. The number and
names of different menus depends on the program.
To give a command to the computer, click a menu title in the menu bar (such
as File or Edit) to call up a pull-down menu, listing all the commands you can
choose. Then just click the command you want the computer to follow
(File➪Save, for example).

Working with dialogs
When your Mac needs extra information from you, it might display a dialog —
essentially a box that offers a variety of choices. Some common dialogs appear
when you choose the Print, Save, and Open commands.
Dialogs often appear in a condensed version, but you can blow them up into
an expanded version, as shown in Figure 3-7. To switch between the
expanded and the condensed version of the Save dialog, click the Arrow
button. 
Whether expanded or condensed, every dialog displays buttons that either
let you cancel the command or complete it. To cancel a command, you have
two choices:
✦Click the Cancel button.
✦Press Esc.
To complete a command, you also have two choices:
✦Click the button that represents the command you want to complete,
such as Save or Print.
✦Press Return to choose the default button, which appears in blue.
Viewing data in a window
Every program needs to accept, manipulate, and/or display data. A word
processor lets you type and edit text, an accounting program lets you type and
edit numbers, and a presentation program lets you display text and pictures.

36
To help you work with different types of data (text and pictures), every
program displays information inside a rectangular area called a window,
as shown in Figure 3-8.
In the early days of personal computers, a program treated the entire screen
as a window for displaying information. This was fine when computers could
run only one program at a time, but nowadays you can often run two or
more programs at the same time. To give each program a chance to display
information on the screen, computers had to divide the screen into windows
where each window acts like a miniature screen.
Dividing a screen into multiple windows offers several advantages:
✦Two or more programs can display information on the screen 
simultaneously.
✦A single program can open and display information stored in two or
more files.
✦You can copy (or move) data from one window to another. If each
window belongs to a different program, this action transfers data from
one program to another.

Of course, windows aren’t perfect. When a window appears on the screen, it
might be too big or too small, in the wrong part of the screen, or displaying
the beginning of a file when you want to see the middle or the end. To control
the appearance of a window, most windows provide the following built-in
controls, as shown in Figure 3-9:
✦Title bar
✦Resize corner
✦Close button
✦Minimize button
✦Zoom button
✦Scroll bars
✦Toolbar button

38
Moving a window with the title bar
The title bar of every window serves two purposes:
✦It identifies the filename that contains the data displayed in the window.
✦It provides a place to grab hold of when you want to drag (move) the
window to a new location on the screen.
If you want to move a window on the screen, you have to drag the title bar
by following these steps:
1. Move the pointer over the title bar of the window you want to move.
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse.
The window moves wherever you drag the mouse.
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the new location
of the window.
Resizing a window
Sometimes a window might be in the perfect location, but it’s too small or
too large for what you want to do at that moment. To change the size of a
window, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over the resize corner in the bottom-right corner of
the window. 
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse.
The window grows or shrinks as you drag the mouse.
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of
the window. 
Closing a window
When you’re done viewing or editing any information displayed in a window,
you might as well close the window to keep it from cluttering the screen. To
close a window, follow these steps:
1. Click the Close button (the little red button) of the window you want
to close.
If you haven’t saved the information inside the window, your Mac
displays a dialog that asks whether you want to save it.

Book I
Chapter 3
Getting Acquainted
with the Mac 
User Interface
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
39
2. In the dialog that appears, click one of the following choices:
• Don’t Save: Closes the window and discards any changes you made
to the information inside the window.
• Cancel: Keeps the window open.
• Save: Closes the window but saves the information in a file. If this is
the first time you’ve saved this information, another dialog appears,
giving you a chance to name the file to store the information and
save it in a specific location on your hard drive. 
Computers typically offer two or more ways to accomplish the same task, so
you can choose the way you like best. As an alternative to clicking the Close
button, you can also click inside the window you want to close and then
choose File➪Close or press Ô+W. 
Minimizing a window
Sometimes you might not want to close a window, but you still want to get it
out of the way so it doesn’t clutter up your screen. In that case, you can min-
imize a window, which tucks the window as a tiny icon on the right side of
the Dock, as shown in Figure 3-10. 
A minimized window icon on the Dock actually displays the contents of that
window. If you squint hard enough (or have a large enough screen), you can
see what each minimized window contains. 
To minimize a window, choose one of the following:
✦Click the Minimize button of the window you want to tuck out of the
way. 
✦Click the window you want to minimize and choose Window➪Minimize
(or press Ô+M).
✦Double-click the window’s title bar. (This feature can be turned off as
explained later in this section.)
To open a minimized window, follow these steps:
Minimized windows

1. Move the mouse over the minimized window on the Dock.
2. Click the mouse button. 
Your minimized window pops back on the screen.
Zooming a window
If a window is too small to display information, you don’t have to sit and take
it. Just put your Zoom button to use, which appears as a green button in the
upper-left corner of every window. (When you move the mouse over the
Zoom button, a plus sign appears inside.)
Zooming a window makes it grow larger, as shown in Figure 3-11. With some
programs, zooming expands a window to fill most of the screen, but with
other programs, zooming expands a window slightly but doesn’t fill most of
the screen. 
The Zoom button is a toggle button, meaning that if you click the button
again, you end up shrinking the window back to its smaller size.
Scrolling through a window
No matter how large you make a window, it may still be too small to display
the entire contents of its file. Think of a window as a porthole that lets you

41
peek at part, but not all, of a file’s contents. If a window isn’t large enough to
display an entire file, the window will let you know by displaying vertical or
horizontal scroll bars. 
There are three ways to use the kinds of scroll bars you see in Figure 3-12:
✦Click the scroll arrows: Scrolls the window up/down or right/left. If you
move the mouse over a scroll arrow and hold down the mouse button,
the window will continuously scroll.
✦Drag the scroll box: Scrolls through a window faster.
✦Click in the scroll area: Scrolls up/down or right/left in large increments.
Many mice offer a scroll wheel in the middle. By rolling this scroll wheel, you
can scroll a window up or down. The Apple Mighty Mouse has a scroll ball in
the middle that lets you roll it to scroll up/down or right/left. On a laptop
Mac, you can scroll by pressing one fingertip on the trackpad and rubbing a
second fingertip up/down or right/left.

Using the Toolbar button
Some windows display a row of icons at the top of the window, known as a
toolbar. The purpose of a toolbar is to give you one-click access to com-
monly used commands, such as saving or printing a file. However, these tool-
bar icons can also clutter up the appearance of a window.
To give you the option of hiding (or viewing) a window’s toolbar icons, a
window might display a Toolbar button in its upper-right corner, as shown in
Figure 3-13.
To toggle between hiding or displaying a toolbar, click the Toolbar button.
Some programs might also give you the option of hiding its toolbar another
way, such as by choosing View➪Hide Toolbar.
Not all windows have a Toolbar button.
Manipulating windows with Exposé
The more windows you open, the more cluttered your screen can appear,
much like taking stacks of paper and throwing them all over your desk. To
organize your windows, you could move, resize, and minimize each window
individually, but that’s too tedious and time-consuming. As a faster alterna-
tive, you can use a handy feature called Exposé.

Chapter 3

43
The whole idea behind Exposé is to give you these fast, convenient ways to
organize your windows:
✦Shrinking all windows to the size of thumbnail images so you can see
and choose the window you want to use, as shown in Figure 3-14
Pressing the F9 function key does this bit of shrinking for you.
✦Showing only those windows that belong to the currently active pro-
gram, as shown in Figure 3-15. Pressing F10 is the trick here.
✦Hiding all windows. Pressing F11 pulls out the old invisibility cloak.
Pressing the F9, F10, and F11 function keys toggles the display. So pressing
F9 initially shrinks all windows as thumbnail images, but pressing F9 a
second time reverts all windows back to normal size.
When windows appear as thumbnail images after you press F9 or F10, you
can move the pointer over the thumbnail image and view the file name that
appears in that particular window.

Playing with Icons in the Dock and Finder
The Mac shows programs and files as pictures called icons. Program icons
act like a visual trademark of the program, such as a Postage Stamp icon that
represents the Mail program or the Compass icon that represents the Safari
program. 
File icons typically contain the filename along with a picture that contains
the program that created it. By providing this visual clue, you can see which
files were created by specific programs. 
Icons commonly appear in three locations, as shown in Figure 3-16:
✦The Desktop
✦The Dock
✦Inside a Finder window
The Desktop
The Desktop appears on the screen when you don’t have any open windows
covering it up. In the old days, it was common to place program and file
icons on the desktop for quick access, much like placing an important book
or day planner in one corner of your desk so you can grab it easily.

Unfortunately, the more icons you store on the Desktop, the more cluttered
it appears, making it harder to find anything. Although you can still store
program and file icons on the Desktop, it’s more common to store program
and folder icons on the Dock and program and file icons in the Finder.
The Desktop always shows an icon that represents your hard drive. If you
have any additional storage devices attached to your Mac (such as an external
hard drive, a CD or DVD, or a USB flash drive), you see icons for those storage
devices on your Desktop, too. 
The Dock
The Dock is a rectangular strip that contains both program icons and file
icons. To help keep your icons organized, the Dock places Program icons on
the left side of a divider and File icons on the right side, as shown in Figure 3-17.
Besides acting as a convenient place to store and find frequently used programs
and files, the Dock can also tell you which programs are currently running by
displaying a glowing dot under the icon of each running program.

Moving the Dock
The Dock initially appears at the bottom of the screen, but you can move it
to the left or right of the screen. (You can’t move the Dock to the top or else
it would cover up the menu bar.)
To move the Dock to a new location, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪Dock➪Dock Preferences.
A submenu appears as shown in Figure 3-18.
2. Click a new position — Left, Bottom, or Right. 
A check mark appears next to your selection, and the Dock makes its move.
Resizing the Dock
The Dock can grow each time you add more Program or File icons to it.
However, you might want to modify the size of icons on the Dock so that the
Dock as a whole doesn’t appear too small or too large. To resize the Dock,
follow these steps:

1. Choose Ú➪Dock➪Dock Preferences.
The Dock Preferences dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-19.
2. Drag the Size slider to adjust the size of all icons on the Dock.
3. Click the Close button of the Dock Preferences window.
The individual icons on the Dock are resized according to your wishes.
Another way to resize the Dock is to move the pointer over the Dock divider,
hold down the left mouse button, and drag the mouse left or right.
Magnifying the Dock
The more icons you store on the Dock, the smaller all icons appear as the
Dock shrinks to squeeze all icons on the Dock. When icons appear too small,
it can be hard to see which icon the mouse is pointing at. To help identify
the icon that the pointer is over, you can turn on magnification, which
basically pumps up any icon beneath the pointer, as shown in Figure 3-20.

The Dock Preferences dialog appears. (Refer to Figure 3-19.)
2. Select (or clear) the Magnification check box.
3. Drag the Magnification slider to adjust the magnification of the Dock.
4. Click the Close button of the Dock Preferences dialog.
For a fast way to turn magnification on or off, choose Ú➪Dock➪Turn
Magnification On (Off). 
Hiding the Dock
The Dock might be convenient, but it can clutter up the screen. To get all the
advantages of the Dock without the disadvantage of staring at the Dock all
the time, you can hide the Dock.
Hiding the Dock means that the Dock tucks itself out of sight, but as soon as
you move the mouse near the edge of the screen where the Dock is located
(bottom, left, or right), the Dock pops into view. 
To hide (or show) the Dock, click the Apple menu and choose Ú➪Dock➪
Turn Hiding On (Off). 
You find out how to customize the icons on the Dock in Book I, Chapter 4.
The Finder
The Finder is a program that lets you find, copy, move, rename, delete, and
open a file on your Mac. You can actually run programs directly from the Finder,
but the Dock makes finding and running programs much more convenient.
The Finder runs all the time. To switch to the Finder, click the Finder icon
(the smiley face icon on the far left of the Dock) on the Dock.

Sometimes when you switch to the Finder, you might not see a Finder
window. To open a Finder window, choose File➪New Finder Window. You can
open as many Finder windows as you want, although it’s common just to
have one or two Finder windows open at a time.
The Finder window looks different than the windows of other programs.
Because the Finder helps you manage the files stored on your hard drive, the
Finder window consists of two panes, as shown in Figure 3-21.
The left pane, called the Sidebar, displays four different categories:
✦Devices: Lists all the storage devices connected to your Mac, such as
hard drives, flash drives, and CD/DVD drives.
✦Shared: Lists all shared storage devices connected on a local area network.
✦Places: Lists the Desktop, Home, Applications, and Documents folders,
which are the default folders for storing files.
✦Search For: Lists the programs or files you’ve stored recently such as
today, yesterday, or in the past week. This category also lists All Images,
All Movies, and All Documents folders where you can view all the
images, movies, or documents (files created by word processors,
spreadsheets, and so on) stored on your Mac.

The right pane displays the contents of an item selected in the left pane. If
you click the hard drive icon in the left pane, the right pane displays the
contents of that hard drive. All programs and files displayed in the Finder
window appear as icons.
You find out how to use the Finder in more detail in Book I, Chapter 6.
Getting Help
Theoretically, the Mac should be so easy and intuitive that you can teach
yourself how to use your computer just by looking at the screen. Realistically,
the Mac can still be confusing and complicated. Because most people never
read computer manuals anyway, your Mac includes a built-in help system. Any
time you’re confused using your Mac, try looking for answers in the Mac help
system. If you get lucky, you just might find the answer you’re looking for.
The Mac help system offers two types of help. First, it can point out specific
menu commands to choose for accomplishing a specific task. So if you want
to know how to save or print a file, the Mac help system will point out the
Save or Print command so you’ll always know which command to choose. 
Second, the Mac help system can provide brief explanations for how to
accomplish a specific task. By skimming through the brief explanations, you
can (hopefully) figure out how to do something useful.
Pointing out commands to use
To use the Mac help system to point out the commands you need to use,
follow these steps:
1. Click on the Finder icon on the Dock.
The Finder menu bar appears.
2. Click the Help menu. 
A Search text box appears, as shown in Figure 3-22.

3. Click in the Search text box and type a word or phrase. 
If you want help on printing, for example, type print. As you type, a list
of possible help topics appears, as shown in Figure 3-23.
4. Click a help topic. 
A floating arrow points to the command on a menu to show you how to
access your chosen help topic, as shown in Figure 3-24.
When accessing the help system of specific programs, you see a Help System

In This Chapter
 Running programs from the Dock
 Double-clicking icons
 Switching between programs
 Using Spaces
 Shutting down programs
A
fter you have the Mac OS X operating system up and running, you can
run any additional programs, such as a word processor, a video game,
a Web browser, or an e-mail program. The number of programs you can load
and run simultaneously is limited only by the amount of hard drive space
and memory crammed inside your Mac. 
To start up a program, you can choose four different methods:
✦Click a program icon in the Dock.
✦Double-click a program icon in the Finder.
✦Double-click a document icon in the Finder.
✦Click a program name from the Recent Items Apple menu.
The next few sections take a closer look at each one of these methods.
Running a Program from the Dock
To run a program from the Dock, just click the program icon that you want
to run. (What? Were you expecting something difficult?)
The Dock contains icons that represent some (but not all) of the programs
installed on your Mac. When you turn on your Mac for the first time, you see
that the Dock already includes a variety of programs that Apple thinks you
might want to use right away. However, you can always add or delete pro-
gram icons from the Dock (more on that later).

Running a Program from the Dock
56
When using programs, you can use the Dock in several ways:
✦To gain one-click access to your favorite programs.
✦To see which programs are currently running.
✦To switch between different programs quickly.
✦To see which windows you have minimized. (Minimized windows are
tucked out of sight but still open.)
✦To view a specific program window.
✦To hide all windows that belong to a specific program.
Your Mac displays a dot underneath the icon of every running program. By
glancing at the Dock, you can identify all running programs at a glance. (See
Figure 4-1.)
Knowing which programs are running is a big help, because now you can
easily switch between each running program by simply clicking that pro-
gram icon again. So, if you want to switch to the iTunes program from the
GarageBand program, you can just click the iTunes program icon. This
would immediately display the iTunes window and display the iTunes pro-
gram name in the Application menu on the menu bar at the top of the
screen. (Clicking the iTunes program icon brings iTunes to the fore, but the
GarageBand program doesn’t quit on you; it just moseys to the background,
waiting for its turn to step into the limelight again.)
The Dock identifies all running programs by displaying a dot underneath the
icon of each running program. The Application menu in the menu bar identi-
fies the currently active program. You can have multiple programs running,
but you can have only one program that’s currently active. (The active pro-
gram is the one that accepts any data or commands you give it.) 
You can add or delete program icons from the Dock so it contains only the
programs you use most often, and you can arrange the icons on the Dock to
suit yourself and make starting programs even easier. The following sections
give you all the dirty details on the relationship between the Dock and its
icons.

Adding program icons to the Dock
The Dock includes several programs already installed on your Mac, but if
you install more programs, you might want to add those program icons to
the Dock as well. One way to add a program icon to the Dock is to click and
drag the icon onto the Dock. Here’s how that’s usually done:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears.
2. Click the Applications folder.
The Finder displays the contents of the Applications folder.
3. Move the pointer over a program icon, hold down the mouse button,
and drag the pointer where you want to place the icon on the Dock.
The existing Dock icons move to the side to make room for the new icon.
Make sure you drag program icons in the Dock to the left of the divider,
which appears as a gap near the Trash icon. To the left of the divider,
you see program icons. To the right of the divider, you can store file or
folder icons. (To keep you from dropping programs icons to the right of
the divider, your Mac won’t let you no matter how hard you might try, 
so there.)
4. Release the mouse button to place the program icon in the Dock.
When you drag a program icon in the Dock, you aren’t physically moving
the program out of the Applications folder onto the Dock; you’re just
creating a link from the Dock to the actual program (which is still safely
stashed in its folder).
You can also add a program icon to the Dock right after you load a program.
Remember that the Dock displays the icons of all running programs at all
times, but when you exit a program, that program’s icon — if it’s not one of
Apple’s Chosen Few and you haven’t added it to the Dock — will disappear
off the Dock. To keep an icon in the Dock, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Click the Applications folder. 
The Finder displays the contents of the Applications folder.
3. Double-click the program icon you want to load. 
Your chosen program’s icon appears on the Dock with a dot underneath.
4. Right-click this program icon in the Dock. 
A shortcut menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Running a Program from the Dock
58
5. Choose Keep in Dock from the shortcut menu. 
Now if you exit from this program, its program icon remains visible in
the Dock.
Rearranging program icons in the Dock
After you’ve placed program icons in the Dock, you might want to rearrange
their order. How you arrange your Dock icons is totally up to you. Some
people group certain programs on one part of the Dock, and others arrange
program icons alphabetically to make them easier to find. 
To rearrange program icons in the Dock, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over a program icon that you want to move.
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse sideways. 
Notice that as you move a program icon, the existing icons move to the
side to show you where the icon will appear if you let go of the mouse
button.
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new position of
the program icon in the Dock.
Removing program icons from the Dock
If you keep adding program icons to the Dock, eventually you’ll find that you
rarely use some of these programs. Rather than let them clutter up your
Dock, it’s better to get rid of them. 
If you like having a program icon in the Dock but want to make room on 
the Dock for other programs, you can store programs icons in a folder and
then store that folder on the right of the divider in the Dock. Now to load
that program, you can click its folder icon in the Dock and then click the 
program icon.

The only two icons you can never remove from the Dock are the Finder and
Trash icons.
To remove a program icon from the Dock, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over a program icon that you want to remove from
the Dock.
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse until the program
icon no longer appears over the Dock.
3. Release the mouse button. 
Your chosen program icon disappears in an animated puff of smoke.
Another way to remove a program icon from the Dock is to right-click the
program icon and, when a menu pops up, choose Remove From Dock.
Removing a program icon from the Dock doesn’t remove or delete the actual
program.
You can’t remove a program icon from the Dock if the program is still running.
Starting Programs by Double-Clicking Icons
The Mac represents files as a graphically descriptive icon with a name. Icons
can represent two types of files: programs and documents. 
Program files represent software that actually does something, such as play a
game of chess or organize your e-mail. Document files represent data created by
a program, such as a letter created by a word processor, a business report cre-
ated by a presentation program, or a movie created by a video-editing program.
Program icons are often distinct enough to help you identify the type of pro-
gram they represent. For example, the iTunes program icon appears as a
musical note over a CD, the iPhoto icon appears as a camera over a photo-
graph, and the Mail program icon (for sending and receiving e-mail) appears
as a cancelled stamp.
Document icons often appear with the icon of the program that created them
or as thumbnail images of their content, as shown in Figure 4-3. So if you saved
a Web page in Safari, your file appears as a page with the Safari icon over it. 
A third type of icon you might see is called an alias icon, which you find out
more about in the “Using alias icons” section later in this chapter. Basically,
an alias icon represents a link to a program or document icon. 

Starting Programs by Double-Clicking Icons
60
Double-clicking a program icon
Because a program’s icon might not appear on the Dock, you have to be able
to access icons another way. Lucky for you, you can find program icons by
looking for them using the Finder. (You can find most programs stored in the
Applications folder, but the Finder can help you find any programs that are
stored in another folder.)
It’s actually possible to store a program icon in any folder on your hard
drive, but you should always store programs in the Applications folder. That
way, if you need to find that program again, you just have to look in the
Applications folder instead of trying to remember whether you stored it
somewhere else. 
To run a program by double-clicking its icon, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Click the Applications folder.
The content of the Applications folder appears.
3. Scroll through this Applications folder window until you see the pro-
gram icon you want. 
You might have to double-click a folder that contains a program icon.
4. Move the pointer over the program icon you want to run and double-
click (or click a program icon and choose File➪Open). 
Your chosen program appears, typically with a blank window, ready for
you to do something programy — such as typing text.

61
Double-clicking a document icon
When you double-click a program icon, you start that particular program.
Unfortunately, if you want to use your newly opened program to work on an
existing file, you now have to search for that file and then open it by using
the program’s File➪Open command. 
As an alternative to running a program and then having to find and open the
file you want to work with, the Mac gives you the option of just double-
clicking the document icon you want to use instead. When you double-click
a document icon, your Mac typically opens the program that created that
document and then loads that document in the program window. 
Sometimes if you double-click a document icon, an entirely different pro-
gram loads and displays your file. This can occur if you save your file in a
different file format. For example, if you save an iMovie project as a
QuickTime file, double-clicking the QuickTime file opens the QuickTime
Player instead of iMovie.
Think of double-clicking a document icon as equivalent to the two-step process
of first opening a program and then opening the document you want to edit.
To double-click a document icon, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder comes to the fore.
2. Click the Documents folder.
The Documents window appears.
3. Scroll through this Documents window until you see the program icon
you want.
You might need to double-click one or more folders until you find the
document you want.
Although it’s possible to store document icons anywhere on your hard
drive, it’s a good idea to always store documents inside the Documents
folder so you’ll always know where to start looking first.
4. Double-click a document icon.
Your Mac loads the program that created the document (if it’s not
already running) and displays your chosen document in a window. If
your Mac can’t find the program that created the document, it might
load another program, or it might ask you to choose an existing program
on your Mac that can open the document.

Starting Programs by Double-Clicking Icons
62
As an alternative to searching for a document manually, you can use your
Mac’s Spotlight feature to search and (hopefully) find that document for you.
To use the Spotlight feature, follow these steps: 
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Click in the Spotlight text box, type all or part of a document name,
and then press Return. 
A list of documents matching what you typed appears in the Finder, as
shown in Figure 4-4.
3. Double-click the document you want to open.
Your Mac loads a program that displays the contents of your document
in a window, ready for you to edit.
Using alias icons
One problem with double-clicking a program or document icon is that you
have to find that icon first. You can move an icon to a single location, such as
on the Desktop, making it more likely that you’ll actually be able to find what
you want. Unfortunately, moving programs out of the Applications folder or
documents out of the Documents folder increases the risk of accidentally
deleting an important program or document, or just losing track of where
you put it. As an alternative to moving program or document icons, you can
create and use alias icons instead.

An alias icon acts like a link to another icon. Double-clicking an alias icon
works identically to double-clicking the actual program or document icon.
The biggest advantage of alias icons is that you can move and place alias
icons anywhere you want without physically moving (and perhaps losing) a
program or document icon. 
One way to use alias icons is to create alias icons to your program icons and
then store those alias icons in a folder. Now store that folder to the right of
the divider in the Dock, and you have easy access to program icons without
cluttering up the Dock.
Creating an alias icon
To create an alias icon, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears and awaits your command.
2. Click either the Applications or Documents folder.
The appropriate window appears on-screen. 
3. Scroll through this window until you see the icon you want. 
You might have to double-click additional folders until you find the pro-
gram or document icon you want.
4. Click to select the icon you want and then choose File➪Make Alias (or
press Ô+L).
A copy of your chosen icon appears in the window with an arrow and
the word alias added to its name, as shown in Figure 4-5.
An alias icon takes up approximately 100 kilobytes (K) of storage space,
which is less than the size of a short letter, so don’t worry about alias icons
gobbling up hard drive space.
Moving an alias icon
After you create an alias icon, you can place it anywhere. Because it’s pointless
to store the original icon and the alias icon in the same location, you should
store the alias icon in a new location. To move an alias icon, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over the alias icon, hold down the mouse button,
and drag the alias icon onto a folder in the left pane of the Finder.
The Desktop folder would be a nice choice here.
2. Release the mouse button. 
Your alias icon now appears in your chosen folder. Double-clicking this
alias icon is equivalent to double-clicking the original icon.

Switching Between Programs
64
You can store alias icons on the Desktop for fast access or in specific folders
to organize documents without physically moving them to a new location.
(Of course, the Dock essentially replaces the need to place alias icons on 
the Desktop, and Smart Folders basically duplicate the process of creating
and storing alias icons in a folder. You find out how to use Smart Folders in
Book 1, Chapter 5.)
Deleting an alias icon
After you’ve created an alias icon, you might decide to delete it. To delete an
alias icon, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the alias icon you want to delete. 
A shortcut menu appears.
2. Choose Move to Trash (or press Ô+Delete).
Your alias icon is now an ex-alias icon.
Deleting an alias icon never deletes the original icon — meaning that if
you delete an alias icon that represents a program, you never delete the
actual program itself. The only way to delete a program or document is
to delete the original program or document icon.
Switching Between Programs
After you start running multiple programs, you’ll have multiple windows
from different programs cluttering up your screen, much like covering a

clean desk with piles of different papers. To help keep your screen organized,
you can switch between different programs (such as between a word proces-
sor and a game) as well as switch to different windows displayed by the
same program (such as a word processor displaying a window containing a
business report and a second window containing a letter of resignation). 
Your Mac offers quite a few different ways to switch between different pro-
grams, including using the Dock, using the Application Switcher, using
Exposé, clicking a window of a different program, or by hiding programs or
entire desktops (truly an embarrassment of riches).
Using the Dock to switch between programs
To switch to a different (running) program using the Dock, follow these steps:
1. By looking at the Dock, ascertain which programs are currently 
running. 
Dots appear underneath the Dock icons of all currently running programs.
2. Click a program icon in the Dock that has a dot underneath it. 
Your chosen program appears on the screen. 
If you want to switch to a specific document window opened by a certain
program, you can switch to that program and that document window all at
once by following these steps:
1. Check the Dock again to see which programs are currently running. 
Dots appear underneath the icons of all currently running programs.
2. Right-click the icon of the program you want to switch to. 
A shortcut menu appears, listing all documents currently opened by that
program, as shown in Figure 4-6.
3. Click the name of the document you want to view. 
Figure 4-6:
The shortcut

66
Switching programs with the Application Switcher
Another way to switch between different programs is to use the Application
Switcher, a program that displays icons of all currently running programs.
After you open the Application Switcher, you can just choose the icon of the
program you want to use. To use the Application Switcher, follow these steps:
1. Hold down both the Ô key and press the Tab key once; then let go of
the Tab key (but keep holding down the Ô key).
The Application Switcher appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
2. Press the Tab key (or press the left- and right-arrow keys) to highlight
the icon of the program you want to switch to.
3. Release the Ô key.
Your chosen program appears on the screen.
If a program has several files open in different windows, the Application
Switcher just switches you to that program, but you still have to find the
specific window to view.
Using Exposé to switch between programs
Switching programs using the Dock or the Application Switcher can switch
to a specific program, but if that program has several open windows, you
need to take time to search for the specific window you want to use. As a
faster alternative, Exposé lets you view thumbnail versions of all your open
windows from all running programs. Then all you have to do is click the
exact window you want to use. To use Exposé, follow these steps:
1. Press F9.
Exposé displays all program windows as thumbnail images.

If you’ve hidden any windows (which you find out how to do later in this
chapter), pressing F9 won’t display those hidden windows.
2. Move the pointer over an open window.
Exposé displays the name of the file in that window, as shown in Figure
4-8, so you’ll know exactly which window to choose.
3. Click the thumbnail image of the window you want to use.
Your chosen window appears full-size on the screen.
Switching by clicking different windows
A fast, but somewhat clumsier way to switch between programs is to
rearrange your windows so you can see two or more windows at once, as
shown in Figure 4-9.
To switch between each window, just click anywhere inside that window.
The drawback with this method is that you must keep all windows visible at
all times, which means you can have a only limited number of windows on
the screen at the same time, depending on the size of your computer screen
and the size of each window. That means each window can’t fill the entire
screen, which can make each window too small to use effectively.

Getting Organized on Multiple Desktops with Spaces

Getting Organized on Multiple Desktops with Spaces
Spaces is a handy new feature available since Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. Spaces
essentially divides your Mac into multiple computers by creating up to 16
separate Desktops. The main purpose of Spaces is to help organize multiple
programs running at the same time.
Rather than cram multiple program windows on a single screen (Desktop),
Spaces lets you store multiple programs in separate Desktops. One Desktop
might contain only Internet programs, such as Safari and Mail, whereas a
second Desktop might contain only video games. 
If one program has multiple windows opened, you can store each program
window on a separate Desktop. So if you had a word processor and opened a
personal letter and a business letter, you could store the personal letter
window on one Desktop and the business letter window on a second
Desktop. If you’re a busy person who needs to run multiple programs at the
same time, Spaces provides one more way to help you stay organized.
Spaces creates multiple Desktops to create the illusion of multiple computer
screens, but each Desktop is actually a single user account. That means any
settings you’ve configured will apply to all Desktops, such as the appearance
of the Dock or screensaver.
After you’ve enabled Spaces and defined the total number of Desktops to
create, you can view all your Desktops as thumbnail images. Then you can
open and move windows from one Desktop to another.

Turning on Spaces and creating Desktops
Before you can use Spaces to switch between multiple Desktops, you have 
to turn on Spaces and create some Desktops. Initially, Spaces creates two
Desktops, but you can add up to 16 Desktops if you want. The more Desktops
you add, the harder it can be to manage them all, so the trick is to pick the
number of Desktops you can manage, such as two or three. 
Later, if you find out you need more Desktops, you can add more. Likewise, if
you find you created too many Desktops, you can delete some. 
Turn on Spaces and create your desired number of Desktops by following
these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Exposé & Spaces icon under the Personal category. 
The Exposé & Spaces pane appears. 
3. Click the Spaces tab in the top center of the pane. 
The Spaces tab appears, as shown in Figure 4-10.
4. Select the Enable Spaces check box. 
Selecting this check box turns on Spaces. 
5. Click the Plus or Minus icons in the Rows and Columns fields to
change the number of Desktops (between 2 and 16).
The number of rows and columns you create simply defines how multi-
ple Desktops are arranged. You could create up to 16 Desktops in a
single row or arrange 4 Desktops in a row in four columns. The layout of
Desktops matters only when you switch between Desktops using the
Control+arrow keys. If you arranged 16 Desktops in a row, switching
from Desktop 2 to Desktop 14 would require pressing the Control+right-
arrow key 12 times. However, if you arranged 16 Desktops in four rows
and columns, switching from Desktop 2 to desktop 14 would require
pressing the Control+down-arrow key three times.
6. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window. 
Configuring Spaces
When you configure Spaces, you can define the number of Desktops to use
and the shortcut keys to activate Spaces or switch to a specific Desktop.
From the Spaces tab of the Exposé & Spaces window (shown earlier in Figure
4-10), you can change the following settings to your liking:

Getting Organized on Multiple Desktops with Spaces

✦Using a Spaces menulet: Select (or clear) the Show Spaces in Menu Bar
check box. Selecting this check box displays a Spaces menulet on the
right side of the menu bar so you can switch between Desktops.
✦Activating Spaces: Choose a function key from the To Activate Spaces
pop-up menu. The default function key is F8.
✦Switching between Desktops: Choose a shortcut key from the To Switch
Between Spaces pop-up menu. The default is the Control+arrow key
combination.
✦Switching to a specific Desktop: Choose a shortcut key from the Switch
Directly to a Space pop-up menu. The default is the Control+number key
combination where the number key you press (1, 3, and so on) identifies
the number of the Desktop you want to view.
Moving program windows to different Desktops
The first time you use Spaces, all your program windows appear on one
Desktop. Now you just need to move them where you want them.
To move program windows to different Desktops, follow these steps:
1. Press the Spaces function key (F8 unless you changed it).
All of your Desktops appear on-screen, as shown in Figure 4-11.
2. Press F9.
Exposé displays every window as a thumbnail within each Desktop image.

3. Click and drag a program window onto a different Desktop image and
then release the mouse button.
Your program window now appears in the other Desktop.
4. Repeat Step 3 for each program window you want to move to a differ-
ent Desktop.
5. Click the one Desktop image that you want to use right now.
Your chosen Desktop image expands to fill the screen.
Switching Desktops
After you’ve arranged program windows on each Desktop, you can switch to
a different Desktop at any time by using one of the following methods:
✦Press F8 (or whatever function key you assigned to activate Spaces) and
then click on the Desktop thumbnail you want to view.
✦Click the Spaces menulet on the menu bar and choose a Desktop
number, as shown in Figure 4-12.
✦Press the Control+arrow key combination until you see the Desktop you
want to view. (Press the up/down or left/right arrow keys.)
✦Press the Control+number key combination. (To view Desktop 1, for
example, press Control+1.)

Increasing (or decreasing) the number of Desktops
You can always increase or decrease the number of Desktops available at
any time. For example, you might want one Desktop to display your e-mail
program and browser and have a second Desktop display your word proces-
sor. Then you might suddenly decide you need a third Desktop to display a
business presentation. When you’re done writing your letter or designing
your business presentation, you could decrease the number of Desktops to
consolidate the number of Desktops to track.
If you eliminate any rows or columns of Desktops that already contain pro-
gram windows, Spaces moves those program windows to another Desktop
automatically.
To modify the number of Desktops, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Exposé & Spaces icon under the Personal category.
The Exposé & Spaces pane appears.
3. Click the Spaces tab.
The Spaces tab appears.
4. Click the Plus or Minus icons that appear next to the Row and Column
labels to add (or subtract) Desktops.
The Spaces pane displays the total number of Desktops you defined.
5. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window when you’re
happy with the total number of Desktops you have.
Turning off Spaces 
If you want to turn off Spaces, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears.

4. Clear the Enable Spaces check box.
5. Click the Close button on the System Preferences window.
When you turn off Spaces, all your program windows return to a single
Desktop again. If you turn Spaces back on again, your Mac remembers the
number of Desktops you had defined before you turned Spaces off. If you
restart your Mac while Spaces is displaying multiple Desktops, your Mac
shuts down all windows in all Desktops. When your Mac starts up again, all
your Desktops are empty again.
Quitting Programs
No matter how much you love using your, you’ll eventually need to shut
down a program. When you shut down a program, you also shut down 
all document windows that program may have open. However, if you 
only shut down a document in an open application, the program keeps 
running.
Closing a document
If you want to stop editing or viewing a specific document but still keep a
program running, feel free to close just that particular document. You have
three different ways to close a document window:
✦Choose File➪Close. 
✦Press Ô+W.
✦Click the Close button of the document window.
If you try to close a window before saving the file, a dialog appears, asking
whether you want to save your file. 
Shutting down a program
When you’re done using a program, it’s a good idea to shut it down so that
you free up your Mac’s memory to run other programs. The more programs
you leave running on your Mac, the slower your Mac could be, so always
shut down programs if you don’t need them any more.

Quitting Programs
74
To shut down a program, you have three choices:
✦Choose the menu associated with the application and choose Quit (such
as iPhoto➪Quit iPhoto to shut down the iPhoto program).
✦In the Dock, click the program icon that you want to shut down and
press Ô+Q.
✦Right-click the program icon in the Dock and choose Quit from the short-
cut menu that appears.
If you try to shut down a program that displays a window containing a docu-
ment that you haven’t saved yet, a dialog appears, asking whether you want
to save your file. 
Force quitting a program
Despite the Mac’s reputation for reliability, there’s always a chance that a
program will crash, freeze, or hang, which are less-than-technical-terms for a
program screwing up and not reacting when you click the mouse or type a
key. When a program no longer responds to any attempts to work or shut
down, you might have to resort to a drastic procedure known as a force quit.
As the name implies, force quitting makes a program shut down whether it
wants to or not. There are two ways to force quit a program:
✦Choose Ú➪Force Quit.
✦Right-click a program icon in the Dock and choose Force Quit from the
shortcut menu that appears. (If Force Quit doesn’t appear on the short-
cut menu, hold down the Option key and right-click a program icon in
the Dock again.)
The next sections give you all the details.
If you force quit a program, you will lose any data you changed right before
the program suddenly froze or crashed.
Force quitting through the Apple menu
To force quit a program with the Apple menu, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪Force Quit.
A Force Quit dialog appears as shown in Figure 4-13. Frozen or crashed
programs might appear in the Force Quit dialog with the phrase (not
responding) next to its name.

2. Click to select the program you want to force quit and then click the
Force Quit button.
Force quitting through the Dock
To force quit a program with the Dock, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the program icon in the Dock. 
A shortcut menu appears.
2. Choose Force Quit from the shortcut menu. 
If the program hasn’t really crashed or if your Mac thinks the program
hasn’t crashed, you won’t see a Force Quit option in this pop-up menu.
In that case, you might have to choose the Force Quit option through the
Apple menu instead or hold down the Option key, right-click a program
icon on the Dock, and then choose Force Quit.

E
very Mac comes loaded with plenty of software to get you started, but
you’ll most likely need to install a few additional programs to do your
work. Because you have a physical limit on the amount of software you can
install on your Mac, you have two choices. One, you can get another hard
drive (an external drive or a larger internal drive) so you can keep installing
more programs. Two, you can delete some programs that you don’t want or
need, which makes room for more programs that you do want and need.
This chapter explains how to install and uninstall software for your Mac. Of
course, before you can install any software, you have to know where to find it.
Finding Software
You can find the more popular Mac programs packaged in pretty boxes that
typically contain a single CD/DVD, a thin manual, and a lot of empty air.
Most of these commercial programs are written and sold by big companies,
such as Microsoft, Adobe, or Corel. 
Many bargain-priced Mac software sold in stores are designed to run on
older Mac computers with PowerPC processors, running the ancient OS 9
operating system. Today’s Mac computers with Intel processors, running
the Mac OS X operating system, cannot run any software designed for OS 9
without running an additional program such as SheepShaver (http://
gwenole.beauchesne.info/en/projects/sheepshaver). 
No matter how big your local computer store is, it can offer only a fraction
of all available Macintosh programs. For a much greater selection of soft-
ware, you have to browse for Mac programs over the Internet. On the

Finding Software
78
Internet, you can find three types of software: commercial, shareware, and
freeware/open source. The following list spells out how they differ:
✦Commercial software: Most companies that sell software through stores
also sell the same commercial programs over the Internet. Sometimes
you can even get a discount if you buy the program directly from the
publisher and download it over the Internet. Even better, if you down-
load a program off the Internet, you’re assured of getting the latest ver-
sion of that program. (When you buy a program off the shelf at a local
computer store, you have no idea how old that program may be.)
As a further enticement, commercial programs on the Internet often
offer a trial version that you can download and use for a limited amount
of time, such as 30 days. After your trial period is over, the program will
either stop working or run with many features turned off. If you pay for
the software, the publisher will send you a registration key that converts
the trial program into a fully functional version. To find trial versions of
programs, just visit the Web sites of different software publishers.
✦Shareware software: Shareware programs are either limited trial ver-
sions or fully functional programs, usually written by individuals or
smaller companies. The idea is for you to try out the program and if you
like it, and then you’re supposed to pay for it. 
✦Freeware software: Freeware programs are typically simple utilities or
games, although some commercial companies distribute freeware pro-
grams as a way to promote their other products. Sometimes companies
offer a freeware version of a program and then sell a more advanced ver-
sion of that same program. As the name implies, freeware programs are
available for you to copy and use at no cost.
A variation of freeware programs is called open source. Like freeware
programs, open source programs can be copied and used without
paying for them. The main difference is that open source programs let
you modify the program yourself if you know the specific programming
language that the program was written in.
Table 5-1 lists some popular open source programs and their commercial
equivalents.

Besides being free, many open source programs offer additional features
that their commercial rivals lack.
For example, the Safari Web browser comes free with every Mac, but many
Web sites are designed to work only when viewed through Internet Explorer
or Firefox. So if you use Safari, it’s possible that you won’t be able to view
some Web sites correctly, but you might want to switch to Firefox (or at least
keep Firefox on your hard drive) so if you run across a Web site that Safari
can’t open, just view that Web site in Firefox instead.

Installing Software
The most common place to install software is inside the Applications folder,
so you should specify that folder when installing software. Some programs
store their program icon inside the Applications folder plain as day, but
others hide their program icons within another folder. (See Figure 5-1 for
examples of both ways of dealing with program icons.)
A program icon actually represents a folder containing multiple files. By
hiding these details from you and letting you treat a folder of files as a single
program icon, the Mac ensures that you can’t accidentally delete or move a
single crucial file that the entire program needs to work. 
Installing software from a CD/DVD
If you buy software from a store, it will probably come on a CD/DVD. When
you insert the CD/DVD into your Mac, you might see nothing but a single pro-
gram icon, along with several other files labeled Read Me or Documentation.
Figure 5-1:
Program
icons either

themselves
or inside a

folder.

Book I
Chapter 5
Installing and
Uninstalling
Software
Installing Software
81
Other times, you might insert a CD/DVD and see an icon labeled Install.
When you see an Install icon, you need to run this installation program to
install the program on your hard drive.
When installing software, your Mac might ask for your password — the one
you set up when you first created you user account. (For more on user
accounts, see Book I, Chapter 7.) Forcing you to enter a password ensures
that it’s really you who wants to install the program, rather than some com-
puter virus or Trojan horse program trying to install itself without your
knowledge. Passwords also keep unauthorized people (such as your kids)
from installing programs that you don’t want, such as video games.
Dragging a program icon off the CD/DVD
If you insert a program’s CD/DVD into your computer and just see a program
icon, you’ll have to install the program by dragging the program icon into
your Applications folder. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Insert the software CD/DVD into your Mac. 
A window appears, showing the contents of the CD/DVD, as shown in
Figure 5-2.
2. Click the Finder icon in the Dock and then choose File➪New Finder
Window.
A second Finder shows up, ready to do your bidding.
3. Move the CD/DVD window and the Finder so they appear side by side.

Installing Software
82
4. Click and drag the program icon displayed in the CD/DVD window,
onto the Applications folder in the Finder Sidebar.
Doing so copies the program icon off the CD/DVD and stores it in the
Applications folder.
Running an installer program
Instead of displaying the actual program icon, a CD/DVD might display an
Install icon, as shown in Figure 5-3. The installer is simply a special program
designed to copy a program off the CD/DVD and place it in your Applications
folder. Installer programs exist because novices often don’t feel comfortable
dragging a program icon from the CD/DVD window to the Applications folder
in the Finder.
To install software using an installer program on a CD/DVD, follow these steps:
1. Insert the software CD/DVD into your Mac.
A window appears, showing the contents of the CD/DVD.
2. Look for an icon labeled Install.
These icons typically look like a cardboard box with its top opened up.
3. Double-click this Install icon. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to continue installing. 
4. Click Continue.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions. 
If you have multiple hard drives, the installation program might ask where
to install the program. (Generally you should choose your Mac’s hard
drive unless you have a reason to store the program elsewhere.) Right
before the program starts installing, you’ll be asked for your password.
You can often halt the installation process by choosing Installer➪Quit Installer.
Installing software off the Internet
Although you can buy software in a box from your local computer store, it’s
becoming far more common to buy software directly off the Internet instead.
Not only does this save the publisher the time and expense of packaging a
program in a fancy box and shipping it to a store, but it also gives you the
software to use right away. 
When you download a program off the Internet, the program will usually
arrive as a DMG (disc image) file. Safari, Mac OS X’s default Web browser,
stores all downloaded files in a special Downloads folder in your Home
folder. The Downloads folder also appears as a Stack right next to the Trash
icon in the Dock. (If you’re using a different browser, such as Firefox, you
might need to define where it stores downloaded files.)
Distributing software as a DMG file is the most common way to compress
files for sending over the Internet. A DMG file essentially copies the contents
of an entire folder and smashes it into a single file. You can always identify a
DMG file because its icon appears with a hard drive icon, and the name
includes the three-letter DMG extension, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4:
DMG files
always use
the same
icon and
include the
DMG exten-
sion at the
end of the

Installing Software
84
After you have a DMG file on your Mac, you’re set to install the software
inside it. Just follow these steps:
1. Double-click the DMG file that contains the program you want to
install on your Mac. 
A License Agreement window might appear, as shown in Figure 5-5. 
Some DMG files fire right up after you download them off the Internet, so
you might be able to skip this step.
2. If a License Agreement window appears, click the window’s Agree
button. 
If you click the Disagree button, you won’t be able to install the program!
The DMG file displays a device icon on the Desktop and displays a
Finder window that contains the program icon stored inside the DMG
file, as shown in Figure 5-6.
3. Click the Finder icon in the Dock and then choose File➪New Folder
Window. 
A second Finder comes to the fore.
4. Move this second Finder so it appears side by side with the first
Finder that displays the contents of the DMG file.
5. Click and drag the program icon in the DMG Finder onto the
Applications folder in the second Finder.
Doing so installs the program in your Applications folder.

6. Right-click on the DMG device icon on the Desktop and when a short-
cut menu appears, choose Eject. 
When you open a DMG file, it creates device icon, which acts like a separate
storage device. This device icon acts like a temporary disk so you can copy
files off it. After you’ve installed a program off the DMG file, you might want
to eject the DMG device icon just to clear it out of the way. (Leaving it on
your Desktop won’t hurt anything.)
After you install a program on your Mac, you can always find it again by look-
ing in the folder where you stored it, which is usually the Applications folder.
At this point, you might want to add the program icon to the Dock or place an
alias icon on the Desktop. (See Book I, Chapter 4 for more information about
placing program icons in the Dock and placing alias icons on the Desktop.)
The first time you run a newly installed program, a dialog might pop up (see
Figure 5-7), informing you that this is the first time you’ve tried running this
program. To run the program, click Open. This dialog pops up to protect you
from malicious programs that might try to install and run by themselves. If
you didn’t try to run a program and see this dialog pop up, click Cancel.

Uninstalling Software
If you no longer use or need a program, you can always remove it from your
hard drive. By uninstalling a program, you can free up space on your hard
drive. 
Before uninstalling a program, make sure you don’t uninstall a program that
you suddenly need after all.
Uninstalling a program can involve three parts:
✦Uninstalling a program: Uninstalling a program physically removes that
program from your hard drive.
✦Deleting program icons/alias icons: When you delete a program, you
don’t automatically delete that program’s icon from the Dock or any
alias icons that you created from that program icon. To delete these
additional icons, you must delete them manually.
✦Deleting program settings: Most programs store user settings in the
Library folder, which is buried inside of your Home folder. When you
uninstall a program, its user settings files remain on your hard drive.
Although not harmful, you might want to wipe these user settings files
off your hard drive to free up space for more programs or documents.
The next few sections give you a more detailed look at what’s involved when
you delete a program.
Uninstalling a program
Because the Mac stores all program files within a single program icon, unin-
stalling a Mac program is as simple as dragging and dropping that program
icon into the Trash.
To uninstall a program, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the program you want to uninstall isn’t running. If it is run-
ning, shut it down by choosing the Quit command (by pressing Ô+Q).

2. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
3. Click the Applications folder in the Finder Sidebar.
The contents of the Applications folder appear in the window’s right
pane.
4. Click to select the program icon or program folder that you want to
uninstall.
5. Choose File➪Move to Trash (or drag the program icon or folder over
the Trash icon in the Dock). 
The Trash icon displays an image showing the trash filled with crumpled
papers.
Before emptying the Trash, make sure you really want to permanently
delete any programs or documents you’ve placed in the Trash. After you
empty the Trash, any files contained therein are permanently deleted
from your hard drive.
6. Choose Finder➪Empty Trash (or right-click the Trash icon and choose
Empty Trash).
The program’s gone.
Removing program icons from the Dock and Desktop
After you uninstall a program, you should also remove all Dock or alias icons
as well because those icons will no longer work. To remove a program icon
from the Dock, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over the program icon that you want to remove from
the Dock.
ZIP, SIT, and other strange files
Occasionally, you might run across files with
extensions such as ZIP, SIT, SEA, or RAR. These
types of files are all different ways to pack mul-
tiple files into a single, compressed file. The
Mac can recognize and open ZIP compressed
files, but if you need to open a strange file like
a TAR or CAB compressed file, you’ll want to
install and use a free program called StuffIt
Expander (www.stuffit.com). The StuffIt
Expander program can open almost any type of
compressed file, even those compressed files
originally created on Windows or Linux com-
puters. Your Mac can create ZIP and DMG files
(which you find out more about in Book I,
Chapter 6), but, if you want to create other
types of compressed files, such as SIT or RAR
files, you’ll have to get another program, such as
the commercial version of the StuffIt program.

2. Click and drag the mouse up until the pointer no longer appears over
any part of the Dock.
3. Release the mouse button.
Your chosen program icon disappears in a puff of animated smoke.
If you created multiple alias icons of a program, you’ll have to go through
your hard drive and find all alias icons and delete them one by one. As a
faster way to find and delete alias icons, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder comes to the fore.
2. Click in the Spotlight text box and type the name of the program you
uninstalled followed by the word alias, such as “PowerPoint alias” or
“Camino alias.” 
The Finder displays the location of the specified alias icons, as shown in
Figure 5-8.
3. Hold down the Ô key and click each alias icon you want to delete.
4. Choose File➪Move to Trash. 
5. Choose Finder➪Empty Trash (or right-click the Trash icon and choose
Empty Trash).
Bye-bye, aliases.

Removing user setting files
Almost every program creates special user setting files that contain any
custom changes you made to the program, such as changing background
colors or modifying icons displayed by the program. When you uninstall a
program, its user setting files still remain on your computer. 
The more unnecessary files you have cluttering up your hard drive, the
slower your Mac will run, because it needs to keep skipping over these
unused files to find what it really needs. To keep your Mac in optimum condi-
tion, you should delete the user setting files of programs you’ve uninstalled
from your computer.
You have two ways to remove these unnecessary user setting files. First, 
you can do it manually. Second, you can buy a program to do this for you
automatically.
Manually removing user setting files
Manually removing user setting files requires digging into your hard drive
and deleting individual files or entire folders. This process isn’t difficult, just
tedious.
If you feel squeamish about deleting any files that you don’t understand,
don’t delete any files without an expert’s help. If you delete the wrong files,
you could mess up the way your Mac works.
Many programs store their user setting files in two folders:
✦The Application Support folder
✦The Preferences folder
To find these two folders, you must look inside the Home folder and then
look inside the Library folder.
Many programs store a user setting file inside the Preferences folder, but not
all programs store files in the Application Support folder. So if you open the
Application Support folder and can’t find any files that include the name of
the program you just uninstalled, that means the program never copied any
files into this Application Support folder.
To delete program files from the Application Support and/or Preferences
folder, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears.

Uninstalling Software
90
2. Click the Home folder that appears in the Finder Sidebar. 
The contents of your Home folder appear in the right pane of the Finder.
The Home folder appears in the Finder Sidebar under the username you
defined for your account. If your name is Bo Katz, your Home folder
might be named bokatz.
3. Double-click the Library folder. 
The contents of the Library folder appear in the right pane of the Finder.
If you scroll through this window, you’ll find the Application Support and
the Preferences folders.
4. Double-click the Preferences folder. 
The contents of the Preferences folder appear. You’ll see files that include
different program names as part of their own names, such as com.plasq.
ComicLife.plist (the user setting files for the Comic Life program). 
If you think you might re-install a program at a later date, keep its user
setting files. That way, if you re-install the program, it will use your old
user setting files. 
5. Click the user setting file that you want to delete and then choose
File➪Move to Trash.
6. Scroll through the Preferences folder and check whether there are
any folders that contain the name of the program you uninstalled. If
you find a folder that contains such a name, click that folder and then
choose File➪Move to Trash.
These folders often contain additional files that the program initially
installed on your hard drive.
7. Choose Go➪Enclosing Folder.
The contents of the Library folder appear again.
8. Double-click the Application Support folder.
The contents of the Application Support folder appear, containing fold-
ers used by different programs.
9. If you find a folder that includes the name of the program you want to
uninstall, click that folder and then choose File➪Move to Trash.
Those program files are history.
Automatically removing user setting files 
Because manually deleting user setting and preference files might seem
scary and intimidating, you might prefer to automatically remove these files

instead. To do this, you need to buy and install a special uninstaller pro-
gram. When you run an uninstaller program, you just tell it which program
you want to uninstall, and the uninstaller program identifies all the files used
by that program, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Some popular uninstaller programs include
✦AppZapper (www.appzapper.com), shown at work in Figure 5-9

hen you need to organize junk scattered around the house, one 
strategy would be to just toss everything in the middle of the floor.
However, it’s probably easier to get a bunch of boxes and store old clothes
in one box, old toys in another box, and old books in a third box. 
Computers work in a similar way. Although you could dump everything on
your hard drive, it’s probably easier to divide your hard drive into boxes to
help you sort and arrange your stuff. Instead of boxes, the Mac uses some-
thing called folders.
A folder lets you store and organize related files. The two most commonly
used folders on your hard drive are the Applications folder and the Docu-
ments folder. The Applications folder contains programs, whereas the
Documents folder contains anything you create and save while using a 
program, such as a letter created by a word processor.
Folders can contain files or even other folders. The whole purpose of folders
is to help keep your files organized so you can find them again.

Using the Finder
94
Using the Finder
The main program for managing drives, files, and folders is called the Finder.
To access the Finder, just click the Finder icon (the smiley face icon on the far
left) in the Dock. The Finder is divided into two parts, as shown in Figure 6-1:
✦A left pane, containing something known as the Sidebar. The Sidebar is
just a fancy term for a list of all currently connected storage devices as
well as all commonly used folders that contain all files used or modified
today or yesterday.
✦A right pane, containing the contents of the currently selected drive or
folder. If you switch to List, Column, or Cover Flow view, the right pane
also shows a hierarchy of files stored inside folders.
Understanding devices
The Devices category of the Sidebar lists all removable or non-removable
storage devices you can use for saving files. Non-removable devices are
always connected to your Mac. Every Mac has one non-removable device,
which is the drive that your Mac boots up from; typically, its internal hard
drive, which is named Macintosh HD. 
A removable drive is any drive that your Mac doesn’t boot up from, such as
an external hard drive or even its own internal hard drive if you booted up
from another drive. You can always eject a removable drive, which simply

removes its icon from the Finder, but you can never eject a non-removable
drive. After you eject a removable drive, you can physically disconnect it.
If you try to physically disconnect a removable drive before you eject it,
your Mac might mess up the data on that drive. Always eject removable
drives first before physically removing them.
Removable devices can be attached and disconnected at any time. Common
types of removable devices are external hard drives, flash drives, and digital
cameras. 
To connect a removable device to a Mac, just plug it in using the appropriate
FireWire or USB cable. 
To remove a removable device from a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder comes to the fore.
2. In the Finder, click the Eject button next to the removable device you
want to remove. 
If the removable device is a CD/DVD, your Mac ejects it. If the removable
device is plugged into a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port on your Mac,
you have to physically disconnect the device.
Some other ways to choose the Eject command are
• Click the device icon on the Desktop and choose File➪Eject.
• Click the device icon and press Ô+E.
• Right-click the device icon and choose Eject from the shortcut menu
that appears.
3. Wait until the device’s icon disappears from the Finder.
4. Physically disconnect the device from your Mac.
Understanding folders
All the data you create and save by using a program (such as a database or
spreadsheet) gets stored as a file. Although you can store files on any stor-
age device, the more files you store on a single device, the harder it can be
to find the one file you want at any given time.
Folders help you divide a storage device into smaller parts. You can even
store folders inside other folders. Initially, every Mac hard drive is divided
into the following folders:

Using the Finder
96
✦Applications: Contains all the programs installed on your Mac.
✦Library: Contains data used by different programs.
✦System: Contains data used by the Mac OS X operating system.
✦Users: Contains any files you created and saved.
Never delete, rename, or move any files or folders stored in the Library or
System folders, or else you might cause your Mac (or at least some pro-
grams on your Mac) to stop working. Files in the Library and System folders
are used by your Mac to make your computer work. If you delete or rename
files in either folder, your Mac might grind to a halt.
The Users folder contains the Home folder of each account on your Mac, 
as shown in Figure 6-2. (See Book I, Chapter 7 for more information about
Home folders and creating accounts.) Each Home folder consists of addi-
tional folders:
✦Desktop folder: Contains the program and document icons that appear
on your desktop.
✦Documents folder: Contains any files you create and save using different
programs. (You’ll probably need to divide this folder into multiple fold-
ers to keep all your files organized.)
✦Downloads: Contains any files you’ve downloaded over the Internet.
✦Library: Contains folders and files used by any programs installed on
your Mac. (Note: There are two Library folders, one stored on your hard
drive and one stored inside the Home folder.)
✦Movies: Contains any video files created by iMovie or other video play-
ing or editing programs such as Final Cut Express or QuickTime Player.
✦Music: Contains any audio files stored in iTunes or created by Garage-
Band or any other audio program such as Audacity.
✦Pictures: Contains digital photographs, such as those stored in iPhoto.
✦Public: Provides a folder that you can use to share files with other
accounts on the same Mac or with other users on a local area network.
✦Sites: Provides a folder for storing any Web pages, such as those created
with iWeb. 
Every drive (such as your hard drive) can consist of multiple folders and
each folder can contain multiple folders as well. This collection of folders
stored inside folders stored inside other folders is called a hierarchy. It’s
important to know how to view and navigate through a folder hierarchy, as
shown in Figure 6-2, because that way you’ll be able to find specific files.

Navigating through the Finder
To get to all the files you’ve stored somewhere on your Mac, you need to
know how to navigate through the different folders and devices by using the
Finder. The main navigation tasks are
✦Switching devices
✦Opening a folder (moving down the folder hierarchy)
✦Exiting a folder (moving up a folder hierarchy to view an enclosing
folder)
✦Jumping to a specific folder
All are crucial tasks — and all are explained in greater detail in the upcoming
sections.
Opening a folder
After you choose a device, the Finder displays all the files and folders stored
on that device. To open a folder, you have four choices:
✦Double-click the folder.
✦Click the folder and choose File➪Open.
✦Click the folder and press Ô+O.
✦Click the folder and press Ô+down arrow.
✦Right-click the folder and choose Open from the shortcut menu that
appears.

Navigating through the Finder
98
Each time you open a folder within a folder, you’re essentially moving down
the hierarchy of folders stored on that device.
Exiting a folder
After you open a folder, you might want to go back and view the contents of
the folder that encloses the current folder. To view the enclosing folder,
choose one of the following:
✦Choose Go➪Enclosing Folder.
✦Press Ô+up arrow.
✦Hold down the Ô key and click the title bar of the Finder to display a list
of enclosing folders. Then click an enclosing folder.
Jumping to a specific folder
By moving up and down the folder hierarchy on a device, you can view the
contents of every file stored on a device. However, you can also jump to a
specific folder right away by choosing one of these options:
✦By jumping to a common folder listed in the Go menu — Computer, say,
or Network. To jump to your Utilities folder, for example, you would
choose Go➪Utilities.
✦By clicking a folder displayed in the Sidebar
✦Using the Go➪Recent Folders command to jump to a recently opened
folder. (Using this command sequence displays a submenu of the last
ten folders you visited.)
If you display the contents of a folder in List, Column, or Cover Flow views,
you can view folder hierarchies directly in the Finder. (You find out more
about using the List, Column, and Cover Flow views later in the “Organizing
and Viewing a Folder” section.)
Jumping back and forth
As you navigate from one folder to the next, you might suddenly want to
return to a folder for a second look. To view a previously viewed folder, you
can choose the Back command as follows:
✦Click the Back arrow.
✦Choose Go➪Back.
✦Press Ô+[.

Book I
Chapter 6
Managing Files 
and Folders
Organizing and Viewing a Folder
99
A command that lets you jump back to a previously opened folder is not the
same thing as the Go➪Enclosing Folder command. If you opened an external
drive and then switched to Utilities folder on your hard drive, the Back com-
mand would return the Finder to the external drive, but the Go➪Enclosing
Folder command would open the Applications folder.
After you’ve used the Back command at least once, you can choose the
Forward command. The Forward command basically reverses each Back
command you chose. To choose the Forward command, pick one of the 
following:
✦Click the Forward arrow.
✦Choose Go➪Forward.
✦Press Ô+].
Organizing and Viewing a Folder
The Finder always shows the contents of a single folder. (A device, such as 
a hard drive, acts like a giant folder.) However, if a folder contains a large
number of files and folders, trying to find a particular file or folder can be
frustrating. To organize a folder’s contents, the Finder can display the con-
tents of a folder in four views:
✦Icon view: Displays files and folders as icons and names.
✦List view: Displays files and folders as names, size, and date modified.
✦Columns view: Displays files and folders in three columns. Clicking on a
folder in the left column displays its contents in the middle column.
Clicking on a folder in the middle column displays its contents in the
right column.
✦Cover Flow view: Displays files and folders like the List view, but also
displays files and folders as icons that you can flip through one at a
time.
To switch to a different view, choose one of the following within the Finder,
as shown in Figure 6-3:
✦Choose View and then choose As Icons, As Lists, As Columns, or As
Cover Flow
✦Click the Icon, List, Columns, or Cover Flow icon

Organizing and Viewing a Folder
100
Selecting items in the Finder
No matter how you view the contents of a folder, selecting items remains the
same. You always have to select an item before you can do anything with it,
such as copy or delete it. There are three ways to select items:
✦Select a single item (file or folder) by clicking it.
✦Select multiple items by holding down the Ô key and clicking each item.
✦Selecting a range of items by clicking-and dragging the mouse or by
using the Shift key. 
The Shift key trick only works in List, Columns, or Cover Flow view. Just
click the first item you want to select in your particular view, then hold
down the Shift key and click the last item in the range that you want to
choose. Your desired range is selected, just like that.
Using Icon view
Icon view displays all files and folders as icons. To organize files in Icon view,
you can manually drag icons around, or you can have your Mac automati-
cally arrange icons based on certain criteria, such as name or date modified.

101
To manually arrange icons within Icon view, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over an icon you want to move. 
You can select two or more icons by holding down the Ô key and click-
ing multiple icons.
2. Click and drag the mouse. 
Your selected icon(s) move as you move the mouse. 
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new location of
your icon(s).
When you manually arrange icons, they might not appear aligned with one
another. To fix this problem, make sure no items are selected and then
choose View➪Clean Up Selection to straighten them up.
Manually arranging icons can get cumbersome if you have dozens of icons
you want to arrange. As a faster alternative, you can arrange icons automati-
cally in Icon view by following these steps:
1. Choose View➪Arrange By. 
A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
2. Choose one of the following options:
• Name: Arranges icons alphabetically.
• Date Modified: Arranges the most recently modified items at the top
of the window.
• Date Created: Arranges the most recently created items at the top of
the window.
• Size: Arranges the smallest items at the top of the window.

102
• Kind: Arranges items alphabetically by file extension, so JPG files will
appear closer to the top of the window than ZIP files.
• Label: Arranges icons alphabetically by color. Icons with no color
appear near the top of the window followed by icons colored blue,
gray, green, orange, purple, red, and yellow.
Using List view
List view displays each item by name, size, date it was last modified, and the
kind of item it is such as a folder or a PDF (Portable Document Format) file.
The biggest advantages of List view are that it always displays items in
alphabetical order, it can display more items in the same amount of space
than the Icon view, and it displays hierarchies of folders as indented items,
as shown in Figure 6-5.
Because List view can display the contents of two or more folders at a time,
this lets you select files from multiple folders. Also, if you click a column
heading in List view (such as Name or Date Modified), the Finder sorts your
items in ascending or descending order.
List view identifies folders by a folder icon and a triangle symbol pointing to
it. Clicking that triangle symbol expands that folder to display its contents —
files, folders, whatever. Clicking the triangle again collapses that folder to
hide its contents.

103
Using Columns view
Columns view initially displays files and folders in a single column. As was
the case with List view, all folders display a triangle next to the folder name.
(Okay, okay, in List view the triangle is just to the left of the folder name, 
and Columns view has the triangle at the far right, but you get to the idea.)
Clicking a folder displays the contents of that folder in the column to the
right, as shown in Figure 6-6.
To arrange items in all columns in the Columns view, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Show View Options. 
An Options window appears, as shown in Figure 6-7.
2. Click the Arrange By pop-up menu (a new addition in Leopard) and
choose one of the following options:
• Name: Arranges icons alphabetically.
• Date Modified: Arranges the most recently modified items at the top
of the window.
• Date Created: Arranges the most recently created items at the top of
the window.
• Size: Arranges the smallest items at the top of the window.

• Label: Arranges icons alphabetically by the color label. Icons with no
label appear near the top of the window followed by icons labeled
blue, gray, green, orange, purple, red, and yellow.
3. (Optional) Use the Text Size drop-down menu to modify the size of
text used for folder labels.
4. (Optional) Select one or more of the following check boxes:
• Always open in column view: Forces the folder to display its contents
in column view every time you click on that folder.
• Show icons: Displays or hides files and folder icons.
• Show icon preview: Displays or hides thumbnail images of the file
contents on the file icon.
• Show preview column: Displays a column that lists additional details
about a file or folder such as its size and last date and time it was
opened.
5. Click the Close button of the Options window.
Using Cover Flow view
Cover Flow view combines List view with the graphic elements of Icon view,
as shown in Figure 6-8. Cover Flow originated from jukeboxes that let you
pick songs by viewing and flipping through album covers. In the Finder,
Cover Flow lets you choose files or folders by flipping through enlarged
icons of those files or folders, which can make finding a particular file or
folder easier.

To scroll through items in the Cover Flow view, you have a number of
choices:
✦Click the left and right scroll arrows on the Cover Flow scroll bar (that
appears in the middle of the Finder).
✦Drag the scroll box in the horizontal scroll bar on the Cover Flow 
scroll bar.
✦Click in the scroll area to the left or right of the scroll box on the Cover
Flow scroll bar.
✦Click an icon that appears in the top half of the Cover Flow view.
✦Press the up- and down-arrow keys to select a different file or folder in
the list portion of the Cover Flow view. Each time you select a different
file or folder, the Cover Flow icon for that file or folder appears.
Creating Folders
In additional to letting you navigate your way through different folders, the
Finder also lets you create folders. The main purpose for creating a folder is
to organize related files and folders together. You have two ways to create a
folder:
✦In the Finder
✦In a Save As dialog
The next sections walk you through both methods.

106
Creating a folder using the Finder menu
You can create a folder anywhere, although the first place you’re likely to
create a folder is inside the Documents folder to organize your files. There
are an infinite number of ways to divide and organize your Documents folder.
You might create multiple folders named Word Processor Files, Spreadsheets,
and Databases. Or you might create multiple folders based on topics such as
2012 Tax Info, which might contain a mix of word processor, spreadsheet,
and database files. The way you organize your folders is up to you. 
To create a folder by using the Finder menu, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. In the Sidebar of the Finder, click the device where you want to create
a folder.
3. Navigate to and open the folder where you want to store your new
folder, such as inside the Documents folder. 
4. Choose File➪New Folder. 
An untitled folder icon appears with its name selected.
5. Type a descriptive name for your folder.
Your new folder is christened and ready for use.
Creating a folder through the Save As dialog
The Finder isn’t the only way to create a new folder. When you save a file for
the first time or save an existing file under a new name (using the Save As
command), you can also create a new folder to store your file at the same
time. To create a folder within the Save As dialog, follow these steps:
1. Create a new document in any program, such as Keynote or Pages.
2. Choose File➪Save As. 
A Save As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-9

3. Click the Arrow button to the right of the Save As text box. 
The Save As dialog expands to display a Finder, as shown in Figure 6-10.
4. In the Sidebar of this Finder, click the device where you want to
create a folder and then open the folder where you want to create a
new folder.
5. Click the New Folder button.
A New Folder dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-11.

A new folder is created in the location you specified.
This name cannot be identical to the name of any existing folder in that
location.
7. Back in the main window of the Save As/Finder dialog, type a name
for your document in the Save As text field and then click Save.
Your new document is stored in your new folder.
Manipulating Files and Folders
After you’ve created a file (using a program like a word processor) or a
folder (using the Finder or a Save As dialog from a program), you might need
to change or edit the name of that file or folder to correct a misspelling or
just to change the name altogether. In addition, you might need to move or
copy that file or folder to a new location, or delete it altogether.
To make sure you’re copying, moving, or changing the right file, you might
want to open it first. However, this can take time so a faster way to view the
contents of a file is to click that file (in the Icon, List, Columns, or Cover Flow
view) and choose File➪Quick Look or press Ô+Y, which lets you peek into
the file’s contents, as shown in Figure 6-12.
The Quick Look command behaves differently depending on the type of file
you’re peeking into:
✦An audio file plays in its entirety so you can hear its contents.
✦A full-size picture file appears in a window so you can see what the pic-
ture looks like.

✦A program file displays its icon along with a name, size, and date of last

Renaming a file or folder
The only limitation on naming a file or folder is that a name can’t be longer
than 255 characters and the name can’t be identical to another file or folder
in that same location. For example, you can’t have two files or folders named
Tax Info stored in the same folder (such as the Documents folder). How-
ever, you can have two identically named files stored in different folders.
You can’t use certain characters when naming files or folders, such as the
colon (:). In addition, some programs might not let you use the period (.) or
slash (/) characters in a filename either. 
Actually, you can store identically named files in the same location — as long
as a different program created each file. That means you can have a word
processor document named My Resume and a spreadsheet file also named
My Resume stored in the same folder.
The reason for this is because a file’s complete name consists of two parts: a
name and a file extension. The name is any arbitrary descriptive name you
choose, but the file extension identifies the type of file. A program file actu-
ally consists of the .app file extension, a Microsoft Word file consists of the
.doc file extension, a Pages file consists of the .pages file extension, and a
Keynote file consists of the .key file extension.
So a My Resume file created by Microsoft Word is actually named My
Resume.doc, and the identically named file created by Pages is actually
named My Resume.pages. 
Not all files may have a file extension. It’s possible to save a file without a 
file extension, although this can make it difficult to determine what type of
file it is.

To view a file’s extension, click that file and choose File➪Get Info (or press
Ô+I). An Info window appears and displays the file extension in the Name &
Extension text box. To view file extensions in the Finder, deselect the Hide
Extension check box, as shown in Figure 6-13.
Folders don’t need file extensions, because file extensions are used to iden-
tify the contents of a file, and folders can hold a variety of different types of
files.
For a fast way to rename a file or folder, follow these steps:
1. Click a file or folder that you want to rename.
2. Press Return.
The file or folder’s name appears highlighted.
3. Type a new name or use the left- and right-arrow keys and the Delete
key to edit the existing name.

For another way to rename a file or folder, follow these steps:
1. Click a file or folder that you want to rename.
2. Choose File➪Get Info (or press Ô+I). 
An Info window appears (refer to Figure 6-13).
3. Click in the Name & Extension text box and edit or type a new name. 
When editing or typing a new name for a file, don’t change the file exten-
sion, or else your Mac won’t know which program created that file.
4. Click the Close button of the Info window to make it disappear. 
Your selected file or folder appears with its new name.
Copying a file or folder
At any time, you can copy a file or folder and place that duplicate copy in
another location. When you copy a folder, you also copy any files and folders
stored inside it. To copy a file or folder, you can either use menus or the
mouse.
Using menus to copy a file or folder
To copy a file or folder by using menus, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Navigate to (and open) the folder that contains the files or folders you
want to copy.
You know the drill by now. Use the Sidebar and the various other search
techniques outlined earlier in this chapter to find what you want.
3. Select one or more files or folders you want to copy.
4. Choose Edit➪Copy (or press Ô+C).
5. Navigate to (and open) the folder where you want to store a copy of
the file or folder.
6. Choose Edit➪Paste (or press Ô+V).
You have your own cloned file or folder right where you want it.
Using the mouse to copy a file or folder
Using the menus to copy a file or folder is simple, but some people find click-
ing and dragging items with the mouse to be more intuitive. Clicking and

Manipulating Files and Folders
112
dragging works slightly differently, depending on whether you’re dragging
between two separate devices (such as from a flash drive to a hard drive) or
between different folders on the same device.
If you want to use the click-and-drag method to copy a file or folder from one
device to a second device, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder shows its face.
2. Navigate to (and open) the folder where you want to store your copied
files or folders. 
3. Choose File➪New Finder Window. 
A second Finder appears.
4. In the Sidebar of the new Finder, click a device. 
This device must be different from the device you chose in Step 2.
5. In this second Finder, navigate to (and open) the folder containing the
file or folder you want to copy. 
6. Using your mouse, click and drag to select one or more files or folders.
If you want to drag a file or folder to a new location on the same device,
hold down the Option key while dragging the mouse.
7. Move the pointer over one of your selected items and then click and
drag the selected items into the first Finder and onto the folder you
opened in Step 3.
Notice that a green plus sign appears near the pointer as you drag the
mouse. The green plus sign means you’re copying an item, as shown in
Figure 6-14.
8. Release the mouse button.
Your selected files and folders appear as copies in the folder you
selected.
If you want to use the click-drag-method to copy a file or folder from one
folder to another folder on the same device, you need to use the Option key.
Here’s how that works:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder obediently appears.
2. Switch to List, Column, or Cover Flow view.

3. Click the triangle that appears next to the folder that contains the files
or folders you want to copy.
4. While holding down the Option key, click and drag to select one or
more files or folders.
5. Move the pointer over one of your selected items and then click and
drag the selected items over a folder.
Notice that a green plus sign appears near the pointer as you drag the
mouse. This green plus sign means you’re copying an item.
If you don’t hold down the Option key in Step 4, you move your selected
items rather than copy them.
6. Release the mouse button.
Your selected files and folders appear as copies in their new location.
Moving a file or folder
To move a file or folder by using the menus, you must first copy a file or
folder, paste it in a new location, and then go back and erase the original file
or folder.
Dragging a file or folder to a new location on the same device (such as from
one folder to another on the same hard drive) always moves that file or
folder (unless you hold down the Option key, which ensures that the original
stays where it is and a copy goes a rovin’). On the other hand, dragging a file

or folder from one device to another (such as from a flash drive to a hard
drive) always copies a file or folder — unless you use the Ô key, which puts
a halt to the cloning business and moves the file or folder lock, stock and
barrel to a new location.
Archiving Files and Folders
Files and folders take up space. If you have a bunch of files or folders that
you never use yet want to save (such as old tax information), you can
archive those files instead. Archiving basically grabs a bunch of files or fold-
ers and smashes them into a single file. 
After you’ve archived a group of files, you can later unarchive that file to
retrieve all the files you stuffed into that archive.
There are two common ways to archive files and folders:
✦Creating ZIP files
✦Creating DMG files
ZIP files represent the standard archiving file format used on Windows com-
puters. (By the way, ZIP isn’t an acronym. It just sounds speedy.) 
DMG files (which stands for disc image) are meant for archiving files to be
shared only with other Mac users. As a general rule, if you want to archive
files that Windows and Mac users can use, store them in the ZIP file format. 
If you want to archive files just for other Mac users, you can use the ZIP or
DMG file format.
The ZIP file format is faster and creates smaller archives than the DMG file
format. That’s why most people use ZIP archives to store data. The most
popular use for DMG files is for storing and distributing software.
Creating a ZIP file
A ZIP file can contain just a single file or folder, but it could contain dozens
of separate files or folders. To create a ZIP file, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder comes to the fore.
2. Navigate to (and open) the folder that contains the file or folder you
want to archive.
3. Select one or more items you want archive.

4. Choose File➪Compress.
If you selected three items in Step 3, the Compress command will dis-
play Compress 3 items.
An archive file named Archive.zip appears in the folder that contains
the items you selected to compress, as shown in Figure 6-15. (You might
want to rename this file to give it a more descriptive name.)
To open a ZIP file, just double-click it. This creates a folder inside the same
folder where the ZIP file is stored. Now you can double-click this newly cre-
ated folder to view the contents that were stored in the ZIP file.
Creating a DMG file
Although ZIP files are handy for storing files, DMG files are more often used
to compress and store large items, such as the contents of an entire folder,
CD, or hard drive. To create a DMG file, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears.
2. Move or copy the files you want to store in the DMG file into a single
folder.
3. Choose Go➪Utilities.
The right pane of the Finder refreshes to display the contents of the
Utilities folder, as shown in 6-16.

4. Double-click the Disk Utility program icon. 
The Disk Utility program loads and displays its window, as shown in
Figure 6-17.
5. Choose File➪New➪Disc Image from Folder. 
The Select Folder to Image dialog appears.
6. Using the Select Folder to Image dialog, navigate to and then select
the folder containing the files you chose in Step 2.
7. Click Image.
A New Image from Folder dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-18.
8. Click in the Save As text box and type a name for your disc image file.
9. (Optional) Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a folder or
device to store your disc image.
10. Click in the Image Format pop-up menu and choose one of the 
following:
• Read-only: Saves files in the DMG file just once, but you can never
add more files to this DMG file again.
• Compressed: Same as the Read-Only option, except squeezes the size
of your DMG file to make it as small as possible.
• Read-Write: Saves files in a DMG file with the option of adding more
files to this DMG file later.

• Hybrid Image (HFS + ISO/UDF): Saves files in a DMG file designed to
be burned to a CD/DVD for use in computers that can recognize the
Hierarchical File Structure (HFS), ISO 9660 (International Organiz-
ation for Standardization), or Universal Disk Format (UDF) for storing
data on optical media. (Most modern computers can recognize HFS
and UDF discs, but older computers might not.) Also saves files in a

If you choose encryption, you’ll have to define a password that can open
the DMG file.
AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, which is the latest
American government standard algorithm for scrambling data. 
12. Click Save.
Disk Utility displays a message showing you the progress as it stores the
files in your chosen folder as a DMG file.
13. When the disk imaging is completed, choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk
Utility to exit the program.
Double-clicking a DMG file displays the contents of that DMG file in a Finder.
Searching Files
No matter how organized you try to be, there’s a good chance you might
forget where you stored a file. To find your wayward files quickly, you can
use a feature called Spotlight.
Spotlight lets you type a word or phrase to identify either the name of the
file you want or a word or phrase stored inside that file. Then Spotlight dis-
plays a list of files that match what you typed. So, if you want to find all the
files related to your baseball collection, you could type the word baseball
and Spotlight would find all files that contain the word baseball in the file-
name or in the file itself.
Using Spotlight
Spotlight searches for text that matches all or part of a filename as well as
data stored inside of a file. When using Spotlight, search for distinct words.
For example, searching for A will be relatively useless because so many files
use the letter A as part of their file name and inside of most files. However,
searching for ebola will narrow your search to the files you most likely want.
To use Spotlight, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder promptly shows up.
2. Click in the Spotlight text box, as shown in Figure 6-19.

Book I
Chapter 6
Managing Files 
and Folders

119
3. Type a word or phrase.
As you type, Spotlight displays the files that match your text.
At this point you can double-click a file to open it, or you can copy and move
it to a new location. 
You can change the way your search results appear by choosing View➪As
Icons, View➪as List, or View➪As Cover Flow.
Using Smart Folders
Spotlight can make finding files and folders fast and easy. However, it’s possi-
ble to find yourself constantly searching for the same types of files over and
over again. To solve this problem, you can create a Smart Folder.
A Smart Folder essentially works with Spotlight to keep track of a bunch of
files sharing a common characteristic. For example, tell a Smart Folder to
store info about only those files that contain the phrase top secret in the file-
name or in the file itself, and from now on, you can always look in that Smart
Folder to access all files and folders that match top secret without having to
type the words in the Spotlight text box all over again.
Think of Smart Folders as a way to make organizing your files automatic.
Rather than take the time to physically move and organize files, you can
have Spotlight and Smart Folders do the work for you.

A Smart Folder doesn’t physically contain any files or folders. Instead, it con-
tains only links to files or folders. This saves space by not duplicating files.
Creating a Smart Folder using Spotlight
To create a Smart Folder, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Click in the Spotlight text box and type a word or phrase. 
Spotlight displays a list of files and folders that match your word or
phrase.
3. Click the Save button that appears underneath the Spotlight text box. 
A Save As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-20.
4. Click in the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your
Smart Folder.
5. Choose a location to store your Smart Folder from the Where pop-up
menu.
6. (Optional) Deselect the Add To Sidebar check box. 
If a check mark appears, your Smart Folder will appear in the Sidebar in
the Searches section near the bottom. If a check mark doesn’t appear,
your Smart Folder won’t appear in the Sidebar.
7. Click Save. 
Your Smart Folder appears in your chosen location. Instead of displaying
an ordinary folder icon, Smart Folder icons always contain a gear inside
a folder, as shown in Figure 6-21.

After you create a Smart Folder, it automatically keeps your list of files and
folders up to date at all times. If you create new files or folders that match
the text used to define a Smart Folder, that new file or folder name will
appear in the Smart Folder automatically. Delete a file, and the Smart Folder
deletes that file as well. 
Creating a Smart Folder using other criteria
Besides organizing files and folders using Spotlight, Smart Folders can also
list files and folders based on dates, sizes, color labels, and other criteria. To
create a Smart Folder using these other criteria, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Choose File➪New Smart Folder. 
A New Smart Folder window appears.
3. Click the plus sign icon that appears to the right of the Save button. 
A Kind and Any drop-down menu appear, as shown in Figure 6-22.
Clicking the plus sign icon adds something to the New Smart Folder
window — in this case, a new drop-down menu and a couple check
boxes. In other words, it expands the window. After the window
expands, though, the plus sign icon changes to a minus sign icon, which
you can then use to contract the window back to its original state.
4. Click the Kind pop-up menu and choose a criterion such as Name or
Last opened date. 
5. Click the Any pop-up menu and choose the type of files you want to
find, such as Documents, Movies, or PDF, as shown in Figure 6-23.

10. Click Save. 
Your Smart Folder appears in your chosen location. Instead of displaying
an ordinary folder icon, Smart Folder icons always contain a gear inside
a folder (refer to Figure 6-21).
Using Smart Folders in the Sidebar
To make searching for files easier, the Finder has already created several
Smart Folders in the Sidebar. These Smart Folders are named Today,
Yesterday, Past Week, All Images, All Movies, and All Documents, and they
can be found under the Search For category, as shown in Figure 6-24. 
By clicking one of these Smart Folders, you can view certain types of files,
such as all files created today (in the Today Smart Folder) or all pictures
stored on your hard drive (stored in the All Pictures folder). 
Storing Files and Folders in the Dock
You can always find the files and folders you want by using the Finder.
However, you might find that loading the Finder constantly just to access the
contents of a particular folder can get tedious. As a faster alternative, you
can store pointers to files and folders directly in the Dock instead.
Storing files in the Dock
If you have a file that you access regularly, consider placing an icon for that
file directly in the Dock. That way, the file icon remains visible at all times (at

least as long as the Dock is visible) and gives you one-click access to your
frequently used files. To place a file icon on the Dock, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder comes to the fore.
2. Using the Sidebar, navigate to the folder containing a file you use fre-
quently (typically stored somewhere in the Documents folder).
3. Click and drag the file onto the right side of the Dock to any space to
the left of the Trash icon. 
The icons in the Dock slide apart to make room for your file icon.
4. Release the mouse button. 
Your file icon appears in the Dock. To open this file, just click this file
icon.
A file icon in the Dock is just a link to your actual file. If you drag the file icon
off the Dock, your physical file remains untouched.
Creating Stacks in the Dock
Storing files on the Dock can make them convenient to access, but the more
file icons you add, the smaller each file icon gets as the Dock shrinks to
show all its icons. Rather than clutter the Dock with multiple file icons, con-
sider storing a folder in the Dock instead.
A folder icon when stored in the Dock is called a Stack. After you’ve created
a Stack in the Dock, you can view its contents by clicking the Stack.
To store a Stack in the Dock, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears.
2. Using the Sidebar, navigate to the folder containing a file you use fre-
quently (typically stored somewhere in the Documents folder).
3. Click and drag the folder onto the Dock to any space to the left of the
Trash icon. 
The Dock icons slide apart to make room for your Stack.
4. Release the mouse button to place your Stack in the Dock.
A Stack in the Dock is just a link to your actual folder and files. If you drag
the Stack off the Dock, your folder and its file contents remain untouched.

Opening files stored in a Stack
After you’ve placed a Stack on the Dock, you can view its contents and open
a file in that Stack by following these steps:
1. Click a Stack found in the Dock.
If you have less than ten files stored in a Stack, its contents fan out. If
you have ten or more files stored in a Stack, its contents are displayed in
a grid. 
2. Click the file you want to open in the fan or grid.
Your chosen file opens.
Burning Files and Folders to CD/DVD
A simple way to transfer or back up data is to store them on CDs or DVDs. (A
CD can store 650–700 megabytes, whereas a DVD can store 4.7 or 8.5 giga-
bytes.) After you store data on a CD or DVD, you can easily transfer it to
another computer, even one running Windows or Linux. 
Two types of CDs and DVDs exist: read-only and rewritable. Read-only discs
are labeled CD-R or DVD-R, and you can store data on them exactly once.
Rewritable discs can store and erase data over and over again. Rewritable
discs cost more, but they’re reusable so they’re more useful. The main
advantage of read-only CDs is that some older audio CD players cannot read
rewritable CDs but can read read-only CDs. Likewise, some older DVD play-
ers cannot read rewritable DVDs, but can read read-only DVDs. 
The process of copying data to a CD or DVD is known as “burning a disc.” To
burn a disc, you must specify which files or folders you want to burn to the
disc. If you want to burn files stored in separate folders, you would normally
have to copy (or move) all files into a single folder and then burn the con-
tents of that folder to a disc.
Because copying or moving all files to a single folder can be cumbersome,
you can create a special folder called a Burn Folder. A Burn Folder doesn’t
store physical copies of your files or folders. Instead, a Burn Folder contains
links to your files and folders. That way, a Burn Folder won’t take double the
amount of space needed to store your data.
Creating a Burn Folder
To create a Burn Folder, follow these steps:
1. Click on the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears to do your bidding.

Burning Files and Folders to CD/DVD
126
2. Using the Sidebar, navigate to (and open) the folder where you want
to store your Burn Folder.
3. Choose File➪New Burn Folder.
A Burn Folder appears bearing a circular yellow and black radiation
logo, as shown in Figure 6-25.
4. Copy and paste the files and folders you want to burn to a disc into
the Burn folder.
Burning the contents of a Burn Folder
After you’ve stored the links to your various files and folders in a Burn
Folder, you can burn the contents of the Burn Folder on to as many discs as
you want without having to specify each file and folder to burn each time. To
burn the contents of a Burn Folder to a disc, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears.
2. Navigate to and open the folder where you stored your Burn Folder.
3. Double-click the Burn folder.
Your Burn folder opens. (You can also open a Burn folder by selecting it
and then choosing File ➪Open.)
4. Click the Burn button that appears in the upper-right corner of the
Finder, or choose File➪Burn folder name to Disc, where folder name
is the name of the folder you’ve chosen to burn.
A dialog appears, asking you to insert a blank disc.
5. Insert a blank disc in the CD or DVD drive, as appropriate.
Sit back and wait for the burning process to complete. (A loud alert
sound usually signals the end of a burning session.) If you try to burn
more data than the CD or DVD can hold, your Mac won’t even try to
burn your files. In this case, you have to remove some files from the
Burn Folder and try again.

6. When the burning session is over, eject the finished disc.
Some ways to eject a disc are to press the Eject button on the keyboard
or right-click the disc icon on the Desktop and choose Eject from the
shortcut menu.
Burn Folders are nice for burning files to a CD or DVD, but if you want more
than just basic disc-burning capabilities, consider getting a standalone CD/
DVD burning program such as Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com) or Dragon
Burn (www.ntius.com). Besides duplicating the basic disc-burning features
of Burn Folders, Toast Titanium and Dragon Burn also provide a wealth of
features for mixing and editing audio, compressing video, copying entire
discs, and burning files on the new Blu-ray disc format. 
Deleting a File or Folder
To delete a file or folder, you first have to place that item in the Trash. But
putting an item in the Trash doesn’t immediately delete it. In fact, you can
retrieve any number of files or folders you’ve “thrown away.” Nothing is
really gone — permanently deleted — until you empty the Trash.
Deleting a folder also deletes any files or folders stored inside it. So if you
delete a single folder, you might really be deleting 200 other folders contain-
ing valuable data, so always check the contents of a folder before you delete
it, just to make sure it doesn’t contain anything important.
To delete a file or folder, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder comes to the fore.
2. Using the Sidebar, navigate to (and open) the folder that contains the
file or folder you want to delete. 
3. Select one or more files or folders.
4. Choose one of the following:
• Choose File➪Move to Trash.
• Drag the selected items onto the Trash icon on the Dock.
• Press Ô+Delete.
• Right-click a selected item and choose Move to Trash from the short-
cut menu that appears.

Deleting a File or Folder

Retrieving a file or folder from the Trash
When you move items to the Trash, you can retrieve them again as long as
you haven’t emptied the Trash since you threw them out. If the Trash icon in
the Dock appears filled with a pile of crumbled up paper, that means you can
still retrieve files or folders from the Trash. If the Trash icon appears empty,
there are no files or folders there you can retrieve.
To retrieve a file or folder from the Trash, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the Trash icon in the Dock appears full of crumbled up
paper.
2. Click the Trash icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears, showing all the files and folders you deleted since
the last time you emptied the Trash.
3. Select one or more items.
4. Click and drag your selected items onto a device or folder where you
want to store your retrieved items.
5. Release the mouse button.
Emptying the Trash
Every deleted file or folder gets stored in the Trash. But even files and fold-
ers stored in the Trash eat up space on your hard drive. When you’re sure
that you won’t need those items any more, you should empty the Trash to
permanently delete the files and free up additional space on your hard drive.
To empty the Trash, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon on the Dock (or click on the Desktop). 
The Finder menu appears at the top of the screen.
2. Choose File➪Empty Trash. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you’re sure you want to remove the
items in the Trash permanently.
If you open the Finder and choose Finder➪Secure Empty Trash, your
Mac will write over the deleted file with random data to foil any attempt
to recover that file later with a special file recovery program. If you want
to delete something sensitive that you don’t want to risk falling into the
wrong hands, choose Finder➪Secure Empty Trash instead.
3. Click OK (or Cancel).
For a faster way of emptying the Trash, right-click the Trash icon in the Dock
and choose Empty Trash from the shortcut menu that appears.

very Mac works the same, but that doesn’t mean they all have to look
the same. To personalize your Mac, you can change the way it looks and
even how it behaves. By customizing your Mac, you can stamp it with your
personality and truly turn your Mac into a personal computer.
Don’t get too carried away customizing your Mac. The more you customize
your own Mac, the harder it might be for you to use a different Mac. In other
words, feel free to customize your Mac, but make sure you know how to use
a “generic” Mac in case you need to use another one in an emergency.
Changing the Desktop
The Desktop fills the screen in the absence of any program windows.
Generally, the Desktop displays a decorative background image, but you 
can display any image, such as a picture captured with a digital camera or 
a favorite picture you downloaded off the Internet.
Choosing a built-in Desktop image
Your Mac comes with a variety of images stored and organized into different
categories. To choose one of these images as your Desktop image, follow
these steps:
1. Right-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose Change Desktop
Background from the contextual menu that appears. 

Changing the Desktop

The Desktop preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-1.
2. In the left part of the pane, click a category such as Nature or Plants.
Thumbnail versions of images matching that category appear in the
right pane.
3. Click an image that you like.
The Desktop immediately displays your chosen image as its background
image. 
4. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
For variety’s sake, select the Change Picture check box on the Desktop tab
and click in the Change Picture list box to define how often to change an
image, within the category you chose in Step 2, such as every hour. If you
select the Random Order check box, your Mac will surprise you by display-
ing images from all categories in random order. 
Choosing an iPhoto image for the Desktop
If you’ve captured images with a digital camera and stored those images 
in iPhoto, you can choose one of your iPhoto images to appear on your
Desktop. To display an iPhoto image on the Desktop background, follow
these steps:
1. Right-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose Change Desktop
Background from the contextual menu that appears. 
The Desktop preferences pane appears (refer to Figure 7-1).

The right part of the pane displays all iPhoto pictures contained in your
chosen category.
4. Click an iPhoto image. 
Your chosen iPhoto image appears on the Desktop as its background
image.
5. Click the pop-up menu that appears underneath the Desktop tab and
choose one of the following:
• Fit to Screen: Blows up the image to cover most of the screen, but
might leave edges uncovered depending on the shape of the original
image
• Fill Screen: Blows up the image to cover the entire screen
• Stretch to Fill Screen: Stretches a picture to fill the entire screen,
which can skewer the image
• Center: Places the image in the middle of the screen at its original size
• Tile: Places the image in rows and columns to fill the screen
6. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Choosing your own image for the Desktop
You might have images stored on your hard drive that you never bothered 
to store in iPhoto, such as pictures of your favorite movie stars or sports
heroes that you found on the Internet. To display non-iPhoto images on the
Desktop background, follow these steps:
1. Right-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose Change Desktop
Background from the contextual menu that appears. 
The Desktop preferences pane appears (refer to Figure 7-1).
2. Choose one of the following:
• Click the Pictures Folder under the Apple category. 
This displays all images stored in the Pictures folder. Any images
stored in separate folders inside the Pictures folder will not be 
visible.
• Click the plus sign icon in the lower-left corner and use the dialog
that appears to navigate to the folder that contains the image you
want to use.

3. Click an image that you like. 
The Desktop immediately displays your chosen image. 
If you select the Change Picture check box and set a time in the Change
Picture list box, you can have your Mac display all the images, one at a
time, stored in the folder you chose in Step 4. 
4. Click the Close button in the System Preferences window.
Customizing the Screen Saver
The screen saver is an animated image that appears on the screen after a
fixed period of time when your Mac doesn’t detect any keyboard or mouse
activity. When defining a screen saver, you have to choose an image to dis-
play and the amount of time to wait before the screen saver starts up.
Screen savers were important in the old days when most monitors used
cathode-ray tubes (CRT). If a CRT monitor displayed the same static image
for long periods of time, such images eventually burned in, becoming physi-
cally etched into the glass. (Look at the screens of really old arcade video
games to see these “ghost” images.) If you have a liquid-crystal display
(LCD) monitor — standard for modern computers — this won’t happen, so
screen savers are mostly used for decorative purposes today.
Choosing a screen saver
To choose a screen saver, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon under the Personal category. 
3. Click the Screen Saver tab.
The Screen Saver preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
4. Click a screen saver under the Apple or Pictures category. 
The preview window shows you what your screen saver will look like. (If
you select the Use Random Screen Saver check box, your Mac will pick a
different screen saver image every time the screen saver starts. After
your randomly chosen screen saver starts, that same animated image
appears until you press a key to turn off the screen saver.)
Under the Pictures category, you can choose the Pictures folder, an
iPhoto folder, or the Choose Folder option, which lets you pick any
folder on your hard drive that contains an image to use.

5. Drag the Start Screen Saver slider to specify an amount of time to wait
before your screen saver starts ups. 
A short amount of time can mean the screen saver starts up while you’re
reading a Web page or document, so you might have to experiment a bit
to find the best time for you.
6. (Optional) Select the Show with Clock check box to display the time
with your screen saver.
7. (Optional) Click Options. 
A dialog appears that gives you additional choices for modifying the way
your screen saver appears, such as changing the speed that the screen
saver image moves.
8. (Optional) Click Test to view your screen saver in Full Screen mode. 
Moving the mouse or tapping a key gets you out of test mode.
9. Click the Close button in the System Preferences window.
In the early days of the Mac, one of the most popular screen savers dis-
played pieces of toast and winged chrome toasters flying across the screen.
To relive these good old days, download a flying toaster screensaver from
Uneasy Silence (http://uneasysilence.com/toast).
Defining hot corners
A hot corner lets you give a command to your Mac just by moving the pointer
into one corner of the screen. Two common uses for a hot corner are to turn
on the screen saver and temporarily disable the screen saver.
Figure 7-2:
The Screen
Saver pane
lets you
define an
image and
an inactivity
time.

Customizing the Screen Saver
134
One reason you might want to turn on your screen saver is if you’re going to
leave your computer and don’t want to wait until the screen saver turns
itself on to fill your screen. A reason to temporarily disable your screen
saver is to keep it from suddenly running while you’re reading something on
the screen, such as a news article on the Internet. If you don’t disable the
screen saver temporarily, it might start up, thinking that the lack of key-
board or mouse activity means that you’re gone when you’re really just 
concentrating. 
To define a hot corner to start up or disable your screen saver, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon under the Personal category. 
3. Click the Screen Saver tab. 
The Screen Saver preferences pane appears (refer to Figure 7-2).
4. Click the Hot Corners button. 
A dialog appears.
5. Click in the pop-up menu near one of the four corners of the screen
image displayed in the dialog, as shown in Figure 7-3, and then choose
Start Screen Saver or Disable Screen Saver.
Figure 7-3:
Each pop-
up menu
defines a
function for
a hot

Book I
Chapter 7
Customizing

135
You can define multiple hot corners to do the same task, such as defin-
ing the two top corners to Start Screen Saver and the two bottom cor-
ners to Disable Screen Saver.
6. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window. 
Now, when you move the mouse into the hot corner defined as Start
Screen Saver, you turn on your screen saver. To disable your screen
saver, move the mouse into the hot corner defined as Disable Screen
Saver. 
To turn off a previously defined hot corner, repeat the preceding steps
except instead of choosing Start Screen Saver or Disable Screen Saver,
choose the dash (-) option — which is the equivalent of assigning no com-
mand whatsoever to a hot corner. 
Changing the Display and Appearance
Because you’ll be staring at your computer screen every time you use your
Mac, you might want to modify the way your computer screen displays infor-
mation. To do that, you’ll probably want to mess around a bit with your
screen resolution and/or change the color scheme of your various menus,
windows, and dialogs. The next sections show how it’s done.
Changing the screen resolution
The display defines the screen resolution, measured in pixels — the dots
that make up an image. The higher the display resolution, the more pixels
you have and the sharper the image — but everything on your screen may
appear smaller. To change the screen resolution, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Displays icon under the Hardware category. 
The Display preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-4.
3. Choose a screen resolution from the Resolutions list.
Your Mac immediately changes the resolution so you can see how it
looks. If you don’t like the resolution, try again until you find one that’s
easy on your eyes.
4. (Optional) Click in the Colors pop-up menu and choose the number of
colors to display, such as 256 or Millions.
The more colors displayed, the sharper the images will appear on-screen.

Changing the Display and Appearance
136
5. Click the Close button in the System Preferences window when you’re
happy with the screen resolution.
Changing the color of the user interface
Another way to change the appearance of the screen is to modify the colors
used in windows, menus, and dialogs. To change the color of these user
interface items, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Appearance icon under the Personal category.
The Appearance preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.

3. Click in the Appearance and Highlight Color pop-up menus to choose
a different color.
The Appearance pop-up menu defines the colors that normally show up
on windows, buttons, and so on, whereas the Highlight Color pop-up
menu defines the color of items that you select.
4. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Changing the Date and Time
Although not as impressive as its other functions, your Mac can act like a
giant clock. Keeping track of time might seem trivial, but knowing the right
time is important so your Mac can determine when you created or modified
a particular file as well as keep track of appointments you’ve made through
programs such as iCal.
Of course, keeping track of time is useless if you don’t set the right time to
begin with, so to set the proper date and time, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Date & Time icon under the System category.
3. Click the Date & Time tab.
The Date & Time preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.

7. Click the Closest City combo box and pick a city in your time zone.
8. Click the Clock tab at the top of the window.
The Clock preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-8.
9. Select (or deselect) the Show Date and Time in Menu Bar check box.
If selected, this displays the time in the right side of the menu bar. After
you make your selection, you can modify the appearance of the clock,
such as choosing between a digital or analog clock.
10. Select (or deselect) the Announce the Time check box. 
If selected, this makes your Mac recite the time using a synthesized
voice every hour, half hour, or quarter hour. (The associated pop-up
menus let you specify when announcements are made and what kind of
voice is used.)
11. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.

Adjusting Sounds
139
Adjusting Sounds
Every Mac can play sound through speakers (built-in or external) or head-
phones, from making the simplest beeping noise to playing audio CDs like a
stereo. The three most important ways to modify the sound on your Mac
involve volume, balance, and input/output devices. 
Volume simply means how loud your Mac plays sound by default. Many pro-
grams, such as iTunes, also let you adjust the volume, so you can set the
default volume and then adjust the volume within each program as well. 
Balance defines how sound plays through the right and left stereo speakers.
By adjusting the balance, you can make sound louder coming from one
speaker and weaker coming from the other.
Depending on your equipment, it’s possible to have multiple input and
output devices — speakers and headphones as two distinct output devices,
for example. By defining which input and output device to use, you can
define which one to use all the time.
To modify the way your Mac accepts and plays sound, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Sound icon under the Hardware category. 
The Sound preferences pane appears.
3. Click the Sound Effects tab. 
The Sound Effects preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-9.
Figure 7-8:
The Clock

4. Choose a sound to use for alerts from the displayed list.
This sound will play when your Mac needs your attention, such as when
you’re quitting a program without saving a document.
5. (Optional) Drag the Alert volume slider to the desired location.
The Alert volume defines how loud (or soft) your Mac will beep if it
needs to attract your attention.
6. (Optional) Select (or deselect) any of the following three check boxes:
• Play User Interface Sound Effects: Lets you hear sounds such as the
crinkling of paper when you empty the Trash or a whooshing sound
if you remove an icon off the Dock.
• Play Feedback When Volume Is Changed: Beeps to let you know that
you’ve changed the volume and your new volume settings are active
right now. 
• Play Front Row Sound Effects: Plays sound effects when you’re using
the Front Row program. (See Book II, Chapter 4 for more information
about using Front Row.)
7. (Optional) Drag the Output volume slider. 
The Output volume defines how loud (or soft) your Mac plays any type
of audio from alert beeps to audio CDs.
8. Click the Output tab. 
The Output preferences pane appears as shown in Figure 7-10 and
defines where to play audio, such as through speakers or headphones.

headphones to avoid annoying anyone around you.
10. (Optional) Drag the Balance slider to adjust the balance.
11. (Optional) Select (or deselect) the Show Volume in Menu Bar check
box.
If selected, this lets you adjust the volume through a menulet in the
menu bar.
12. Click the Input tab.
The Input preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-11. Input
defines where your Mac can receive sound, such as through a micro-
phone or through its Line In port, which lets you plug a stereo or TV
directly into a Mac to record sound.
13. Click the input device you want to use.
This option lets you choose whether to accept input from a microphone
or other device connected through the Line In port. If you want to
record your voice, choose microphone. If you plan to record sound from
a device plugged into the Line In port, such as a radio or television set,
choose Line In.
14. (Optional) Drag the Input volume slider to adjust the default input
volume.

15. (Optional) Select (or deselect) the Use Ambient Noise Reduction 
check box. 
If selected, this feature tries to eliminate background noise but can also
accidentally eliminate valid input audio.
16. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window when you’re
done.
Saving Energy
It turns out your Mac can shut off its screen and hard drive if you don’t
touch the keyboard or mouse after a certain period of time. By reducing its
power in this fashion, your Mac can save energy, which can be especially
important for a MacBook running on batteries.
To define the energy-conserving features of your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Energy Saver icon under the Hardware category. 
The Energy Saver preferences pane appears. 
Note: If you’re using a Mac laptop, you’ll see a Settings For pop-up menu
and an Optimization pop-up menu so you can define separate settings
when your laptop is plugged in and when it’s running off batteries. If
you’re using a desktop Mac, skip to Step 5.
3. (Optional) Click in the Settings For pop-up menu and choose Power
Adapter or Battery.

4. Choose an appropriate setting from the Optimization pop-up menu.
Better Energy Savings would be a good choice. Better Performance
makes your Mac run faster but at the cost of consuming more energy,
which could drain a laptop Mac’s batteries. Normal makes your Mac
consume power like a desktop Mac.
5. Click the Show Details button.
The Energy Saver preferences pane expands, as shown in Figure 7-12.
6. Drag the Put the Computer to Sleep When It Is Inactive For slider to
the desired length of time.
This option uses the term Computer to mean the actual microprocessor
(such as an Intel Core 2 Duo) used in your Mac. Putting the microproces-
sor to sleep lowers the amount of energy that the microprocessor 
consumes.
7. Drag the Put the Display to Sleep When the Computer Is Inactive For
slider.
The “display” refers to your monitor. Putting the monitor to sleep blanks
out the monitor to consume less power.
8. Select (or deselect) the Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible

Picking a Printer
144
Picking a Printer
To use a printer, your Mac must use a special program called a printer driver,
which basically tells your Mac how to use your printer. When you buy a new
printer, it often comes with a CD that contains a printer driver. If you have an
older printer, your Mac might already have a copy of the necessary printer
driver. 
Making your Mac work with your printer involves a two-step process. First,
you must physically connect your printer to your Mac, usually through a
USB cable or network connection. Second, you must install the proper
printer driver on your Mac. After you have your printer connected to your
Mac (with the proper printer driver installed), you can control that printer
through your Mac.
You can download printer drivers (and drivers for other types of hardware
such as scanners and pressure-sensitive tablets) directly from Apple’s Web
site (www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/drivers) or from the printer
manufacturer’s Web site. 
Adding (and deleting) a printer
After you’ve physically connected a printer to your Mac and installed its
printer driver, you might need to take one additional step and tell your Mac
that this particular printer is connected. To get your Mac to recognize a con-
nected printer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Print & Fax icon under the Hardware category. 
The Print & Fax preferences pane appears.
3. Click the plus sign icon, as shown in Figure 7-13.
A window appears, listing all printers connected to your Mac.
Note: Your Mac might list local printers (printers directly attached to
your Mac) as well as printers linked to your Mac over a network.
4. Click a printer name in the Printers list and then click the Close
button of the System Preferences window. 
The specified printer is added to the list of available printers.
If you disconnect your printer for any reason, your Mac might still try to use
the printer anyway. To prevent this, you need to delete a printer from your
Mac’s list of printers. To delete a printer, follow the same steps you used to
add a printer, but in the Printers list, select the printer to delete and then
click the minus sign icon. Then close the window.

Creating Separate Accounts
145
Defining a default printer
If you have two or more printers hooked up to your Mac, programs won’t
always know which printer to use. So that’s why every Mac always picks a
single default printer. This default printer is simply the printer that every
Mac program will use unless you specify otherwise.
To define a default printer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Print & Fax icon under the Hardware category. 
The Print & Fax preferences pane appears (refer to Figure 7-13).
3. Choose a printer name (or just choose Last Printer Used) from the
Default Printer pop-up menu.
4. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Creating Separate Accounts
One problem with changing the screen saver or desktop background is that
if several people share the same Mac, not everyone will be happy with the
same images. Rather than buy separate Mac computers for everyone, you
can do the next best thing and divide a single Mac into separate accounts.

Creating Separate Accounts
146
An account essentially gives a Mac a split personality. If you create three
accounts on your Mac, each account can have its own screen saver and
desktop background image. Even better, you can use each account to create
and modify files and folders without affecting any other accounts. By using
accounts, you can give each person the illusion that they’re the sole user of
a Mac.
Types of accounts
The first time you turn on your Mac, you have to create an account that 
consists of a username and password. Multiple people can share a single
account, but this increases the risk that someone might delete an important
file that belongs to somebody else. It’s a better bet to set up multiple
accounts on the Mac for multiple users.
You can create four types of accounts:
✦Administrator: Gives the user access to create, modify, and delete
accounts. You should limit the number of Administrator accounts you
have to perhaps one or two (one for each parent in a household). Note
that when you turned on your Mac for the first time, you created an
Administrator account.
✦Standard: Gives the user access to the Mac but doesn’t let the user
create, modify, or delete any additional accounts.
✦Managed with Parental Controls: Gives the user restricted access to
the computer, based on the parental controls defined by an
Administrator account.
✦Guest: Gives the user access but doesn’t let the user save any files.
Even if you’re the only person using your Mac, you might want to consider
creating a Standard account. That way you can use the Standard account to
browse the Internet or read your e-mail. Now, if some malicious hacker
develops a new virus, Trojan horse, or spyware program that can infect Mac
computers, the malicious program will be able to infect only the Standard
account. Any important files, such as your entire Mac OS X operating system
files, will stay isolated in your Administrator account and will remain safe.
Think of accounts as dividing a Mac into separate watertight compartments
that actually work, unlike those found on the Titanic.
This section takes a look at how to create accounts in general, but Book III,
Chapter 4 specifically explains how to create and manage Guest and
Managed with Parental Controls accounts.

Book I
Chapter 7
Customizing 
Your Mac
Creating Separate Accounts
147
The number one reason to have only one Administrator account is to pro-
tect yourself. If you create two or more Administrator accounts, anyone
using those other Administrator accounts now has full power to erase your
Administrator account along with all of your important files. If you have the
only Administrator account, no one else can delete your account or files.
Creating an account
Before you create an account, you need to decide the type of account to
create as well as come up with the username and password to access that
account. To create an account, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click on the Accounts icon under the System category. 
The Accounts preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-14.
3. Click the Lock icon in the bottom-left corner to gain the ability to
create accounts. 
A dialog appears, asking for your password.
4. Type your password in the Password text box and click OK.
5. Click the Add Account (plus sign) icon.

7. Enter the name of the person who’ll be using the account into the
Name text box.
8. (Optional) Click in the Short Name text box and modify the short

9. Click in the Password text box and type a password for this account.
10. Click in the Verify text box and retype the password you chose in 
Step 9.
11. (Optional) Click in the Password Hint text box and type a descriptive
phrase you think will help you remember your password. 
12. (Optional) Select the Turn On FileVault Protection check box, which
will allow the account user to encrypt files. 
If you allow users to encrypt files, they’ll be able to hide the contents of
their files even from anyone with an Administrator account. Turning on
FileVault protection can also slow down your Mac, since it needs to
spend additional time encrypting and decrypting your files.
If you turn on FileVault encryption and forget your password, your
encrypted data is as good as gone because you won’t be able to

unless you specify an account.)
14. Click Keep Automatic Login to log in to your Administrator account at
startup, or click Turn Off Automatic Login, which requires you to
choose an account to use each time you turn on your Mac.
15. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Switching between accounts
The Mac offers several ways to switch between accounts. The most straight-
forward way is to log out of one account and then log back in to a different
account. A faster and more convenient way is to use Fast User Switching,
which essentially lets you switch accounts without having to log out of one
account first. 
To log out of an account, simply choose Ú➪Log Out. After you log out, a
window appears, listing the names and icons of all accounts. At this time,
you can click a different account name to log in to that account.
Before you can log out, you must close any files and shut down any running
programs. If you used Fast User Switching, you wouldn’t have to bother with
any of that, because Fast User Switching temporarily pauses one account
while your Mac opens another account.

Enabling Fast User Switching
Before you can use Fast User Switching, you have to turn on this feature by
following these steps:
1. Make sure you are logged into your Administrator account. 
2. Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu. 
The System Preferences window appears.

• Save the Home Folder in a Disk Image: Saves the home folder and its
contents in a compressed disk image (DMG) file. This keeps the files
compressed and out of the way, but they’re available in case you
need to find them later. This is like stuffing stuff in an attic to get it
out of sight, but still keeping it around in case you suddenly need it.
• Do Not Change the Home Folder: Keeps the home folder and all its
contents so you can browse through the saved files later.
• Delete the Home Folder: Wipes out any files the user might have cre-
ated in the account.

ight out of the box, every Mac behaves exactly the same. This can be a
good thing because it means you can use any Mac anywhere and
expect it to work the same — whether the Mac is in New Jersey or Norway. 
Unfortunately, not everyone has perfect eyesight, hearing, or eye-hand coor-
dination. If you have trouble with your vision, hearing, or movement, using a
computer can be difficult. That’s why every Mac comes with special univer-
sal access features that you can turn on and modify. These universal access
features fall under four different categories:
✦Seeing
✦Hearing
✦Keyboard
✦Mouse and trackpad
Correcting Vision Limitations
To help the visually impaired, every Mac includes a feature called VoiceOver,
which essentially lets your Mac read text, e-mail, and even descriptions of
the screen to you in a computer-generated voice. For partially sighted users,
the Mac can magnify images on the screen or change the contrast of the
screen to make it easier to read. To modify the vision features of your Mac,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Universal Access icon under the System category.
The Universal Access preferences pane appears.

Correcting Vision Limitations
154
3. Click the Seeing tab.
The Seeing preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 8-1.
4. Click either the On or the Off radio button for the VoiceOver feature.
VoiceOver allows your Mac to describe what’s on the screen and assist
you in using the Macintosh menus.
If you also click the Open VoiceOver Utility button, you can customize
the way VoiceOver works such as how fast your Mac speaks and the
type of computer synthesized voice it uses.
5. Click either the On or the Off radio button for the Zoom feature. 
If turned on, the Zoom feature allows you to magnify the screen by
pressing Option+Ô+(plus sign) or shrink the screen by pressing
Option+Ô+(minus sign).
6. Under the Display heading, select either the Black on White or White
on Black radio button.
Some people prefer Black on White (like the pages in this book), but
others prefer the greater contrast of White on Black.
7. Still under the Display heading, drag the Enhance Contrast slider to
increase/decrease the screen contrast.
Contrast can make the edges of windows and menus easier to see.
8. Select or deselected the Enable Access for Assistive Devices check box.

This option allows external devices (such as unique keyboards or mice)
to use AppleScript to control the Mac user interface. 
9. Select or deselect the Show Universal Access Status in the Menu Bar
check box.
If selected, this option displays a Universal Access menulet on the menu
bar, allowing you to turn different Universal Access features on or off.
10. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window, or choose
System Preferences➪Quit System Preferences.
Correcting hearing limitations
To adjust for hearing impairments, you can increase the volume for your var-
ious system alerts or you can have your Mac flash the screen to catch your
attention instead. To flash the screen instead of making a beeping noise,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Universal Access icon under the System category.
The Universal Access preferences pane appears.
3. Click the Hearing tab.

6. (Optional) To increase the volume for your various system alerts, click
the Adjust Volume button to open the Sound Preferences dialog,
where you can then adjust the system volume to your heart’s content.
7. Choose System Preferences➪Quit System Preferences.
Correcting keyboard limitations
If you have physical limitations using the keyboard, the Mac offers two solu-
tions: the Sticky Keys feature and the Slow Keys feature. Sticky Keys can
help you use keystroke shortcuts, such as Ô+P (Print), which usually require
pressing two or more keys at the same time. By turning on Sticky Keys fea-
ture, you can use keystroke shortcuts by pressing one key at a time. The first
key you press, such as the Ô key, “sticks” in place and waits until you press
a second key to complete the keystroke shortcut. 
The Slow Keys feature slows down the reaction time of the Mac every time
you press a key. Normally when you press a key, the Mac accepts it right
away, but the Slow Key feature can force a Mac to wait a long period of time
before accepting the typed key. That way, your Mac will ignore any acciden-
tal taps on the keyboard and patiently wait until you hold down a key for a
designated period of time before it accepts it as valid. 
To turn on the Sticky or Slow Keys features, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Universal Access icon under the System category.
The Universal Access preferences pane appears.
3. Click the Keyboard tab.
The Keyboard preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
4. Select the On radio button for the Sticky Keys feature.
5. (Optional) Select the Press the Shift key Five Times to Turn Sticky
Keys On or Off check box.
This lets you turn the Sticky Keys feature on or off through the 
keyboard.

6. (Optional) Select the Beep When a Modifier Key Is Set check box.
This alerts you when you’ve pressed a so-called “modifier” key — a key
such as Option or Ô — which is used in combination with another key
to modify how that key works.
7. Select or deselect the Display Pressed Keys On Screen check box. 
If this check box is selected, any modifier keys you press (such as the Ô
or Option key) are displayed on-screen in the upper-right corner of the
screen, so you can verify that you’ve pressed the right key.
8. Select the On radio button for the Slow Keys feature.
9. (Optional) Select the Use Click Key Sounds check box.
When selected, this option makes a clicking sound every time you press
a key to give you audible feedback when you’ve typed something.
10. Drag the Acceptance Delay slider to the desired location.
Dragging to the left lengthens the time between pressing the key and
computer response, and dragging to the right shortens the time.

The Mouse Keys feature is really designed for keyboards that have a sepa-
rate numeric keypad. If you’re using a laptop or other keyboard that doesn’t
have a separate numeric keypad, the numeric keys will be embedded in the
regular typewriter keys. To control the mouse, you have to turn on the
Number Lock key to use the numeric keys to move the mouse. Then you
have to press the Number Lock key again to use the keys for typing ordinary
letters once more.
The Mouse Keys feature can replace the mouse altogether or just provide
you with another way to move the mouse. No matter how you plan to move
the mouse, you might still have trouble finding it on the screen. Fortunately,
you can enlarge the size of the pointer to make it easy to spot and use.
To turn on the Mouse Keys feature or change the size of the pointer, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Universal Access icon under the System category.

the pointer.
7. Drag the Maximum Speed slider to adjust how fast the Mouse Keys fea-
ture moves the pointer with the keyboard.

Using Voice Recognition and Speech
For the visually impaired, the Mac offers both voice recognition and speech
capabilities. The voice recognition feature lets you control your Mac using
spoken commands, and the speech capability lets your Mac read text or
beep to alert you when something happens, such as a dialog popping up on
the screen.
Setting up voice recognition
To use the Mac’s built-in voice recognition software, you have to define its
settings and then assign specific types of commands to your voice. Defining
the voice recognition settings means choosing how to turn on voice recogni-
tion and how your Mac will acknowledge that it received your voice com-
mands correctly. For example, your Mac may wait until you press the Esc
key or speak a certain word before it starts listening to voice commands.
When it understands your command, it can beep.
To define the voice recognition settings, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Speech icon under the System category. 
The Speech preferences pane appears.
3. Click the Speech Recognition tab. 
The Speech Recognition preferences pane appears, as shown in

keyword (such as “Computer” or “Hey, stupid!”) before accepting
additional spoken commands.
If you chose the Listen Continuously with Keyword radio button, click
the Keyword Is pop-up menu and choose one of the following:
• Optional before Commands: Your Mac listens for spoken commands
all the time. This can make it easier to given spoken commands, but
it also means your Mac might misinterpret the radio or background
conversations as commands.
• Required before Each Command: You must speak the keyword before
your Mac will accept spoken commands.
• Required 15 Seconds after Last Command: You must repeat the key-
word within 15 seconds after each command.
• Required 30 Seconds after Last Command: Same as the preceding
option except the Mac waits up to 30 seconds for the next spoken
commands.

o matter how well-designed and well-built a Mac is, it’s still a machine,
and all machines are liable to break down through no fault of your
own. Many times, you can fix minor problems with a little bit of knowledge
and willingness to poke and prod around your Mac. However, sometimes
your Mac might be in more serious trouble than you can fix, so don’t be
afraid to take your Mac into your friendly neighborhood computer repair
store (one that specializes in repairing Macs, of course).
If your Mac isn’t working correctly, check the obvious things first, like
making sure it’s plugged in and that any connecting cables to the Mac are
plugged in and secure. 
Only open your Mac if you know what you’re doing. If you open the case and
start fiddling around with its internal guts, you might damage your Mac. 
Handling Startup Troubles
Sometimes you might press the power button to turn on your Mac — and
nothing seems to happen. Other times, you might press the power button
and see the usual Apple logo on the screen — and then nothing happens
from that point on. If you can’t start up your Mac, your Mac will be as use-
less as a broken PC (or one running Vista).
Before you rush your Mac to the emergency room of Mac repairs, do some
simple troubleshooting yourself. At the very least, recover your important
files so you won’t lose them when sending your Mac to the repair shop.

Handling Startup Troubles
168
Booting up in Safe Mode
If you turn on your Mac and you can’t see the familiar desktop, menu bar,
and Dock, don’t panic just yet. The first thing to do is try to boot up your
Mac in what’s called Safe Mode, a boot sequence that loads the bare mini-
mum of the Mac OS X operating system, just enough to get your computer
running. 
Many startup problems occur when nonessential programs, such as appoint-
ment reminders, automatically load and wind up interfering with other
startup programs, preventing your Mac from booting up correctly. Booting
up in Safe Mode cuts all nonessential programs out of the loop, so that only
your core programs load. A successful boot in Safe Mode at least tells you
that your Mac’s core system hasn’t been compromised.
By booting up your Mac in Safe Mode, you can remove any programs you
recently installed and restart to see if that fixes the boot up problems. If you
remove recently installed programs and problems still persist, copy any
important files off your hard drive to protect your crucial data in case the
hard drive is starting to fail. 
To boot up in Safe Mode, follow these steps:
1. Turn on your Mac.
2. Hold down the Shift key.
You might need to hold down the Shift key until the screen shows you that
your Mac is booting up, such as when the Apple logo appears on the screen
Your Mac comes with a free utility program called Disk Utility, which can
repair minor problems. Third-party utility programs, such as DiskWarrior
(www.alsoft.com), are designed to repair major problems that Disk Utility
can’t fix. 
If the problem isn’t due to other programs trying to load when you turn on
your Mac, you might have a more serious problem with your hard drive. A
minor problem might involve scrambled data on your hard drive that you
might be able to repair with a special utility diagnostic program such as
DiskWarrior (www.alsoft.com). A more serious problem could be physical
damage to your hard drive. In that case, the only solution might be to fire up
the system in Safe Mode again, copy over any critical files to a backup drive,
and then replace the hard drive.

Booting from a CD/DVD
If you can’t boot up from your hard drive, even in Safe Mode, and any utility
program you run can’t fix the problem, you might have to boot from a CD or
DVD by using one of the following types of discs:
✦The original Mac OS X CD/DVD
✦Technical troubleshooting CDs/DVDs
Every Mac comes with a special CD/DVD that contains the entire Mac OS X
operating system. The purpose of this CD/DVD is to reinstall the operating
system and return your Mac to its original condition when you first brought
your computer home. There are two reasons why you might want to reinstall
the operating system:
✦If your computer becomes so hopelessly fouled up, it might be easier to
wipe out everything and start from scratch rather than try to rescue the
hard drive. 
✦If you plan on selling or giving your Mac away, you’ll want to wipe out
your data and return the Mac to its original condition so someone else
can personalize the Mac for themselves.
Wiping out your hard drive and reinstalling the operating system from
scratch will also wipe out any important files stored on your hard drive, so
make sure you’re willing to accept this before reinstalling the operating
system off a CD/DVD. Ideally, you should have all your important files
backed up in a separate location, such as an external hard drive or a
CD/DVD, before wiping out your hard drive completely.
The second type of CDs/DVDs you can boot from are troubleshooting discs.
Apple provides the free Disk Utility program on the original installation DVD
that came with your Mac. You can buy a troubleshooting CD/DVD such as
DriveGenius (www.prosofteng.com), TechTool Pro (www.micromat.com),
or DiskWarrior (www.alsoft.com). By running any of these programs
directly off the CD/DVD, you can attempt to resurrect any hard drive that
fails to boot up on its own. Sometimes these troubleshooting CDs/DVDs can
repair a hard drive, and sometimes they can’t, but if you have important files
trapped on your hard drive, this option might be your only hope to retrieve
your files.
The type of CD/DVD you use depends on what you want to do. Start with a
technical troubleshooting CD/DVD to fix your hard drive. If you can’t fix your
hard drive, you might have to resort to the more drastic step of wiping out
your hard drive and reinstalling everything from the original Mac OS X
CD/DVD

Handling Startup Troubles
170
No matter which CD/DVD you use, you still need to boot off of it. Here’s how
that’s done:
1. Turn on your Mac.
2. Insert a CD/DVD into your Mac.
3. Click the Apple menu and choose Restart. 
4. Hold down the C key.
This command tells your Mac to boot off the CD/DVD instead of the hard
drive.
5. Follow the instructions on the screen to either reinstall the operating
system (when using the original Mac OS X Install CD/DVD) or repair
your hard drive (when using a technical troubleshooting CD/DVD).
Booting from another Mac through a FireWire cable
As an alternative to booting up from a CD or DVD, you can also boot up from
another Mac connected to your computer through a FireWire cable. A Fire-
Wire cable simply plugs into the FireWire ports of each Mac, connecting the
two Macs together.
After you’ve connected two Macs through a FireWire cable, you boot up the
working Mac normally and boot up the other Mac in FireWire Target Mode.
This makes the second Mac’s hard drive appear as an external hard drive
when viewed through the working Mac’s Finder.
By doing this, you can run a utility program (such as Tech Tools Pro, Drive-
Genius, or DiskWarrior) on the working Mac to rescue the hard drive of the
defective Mac, much like jump-starting a car’s dead battery by using a
second car with a good battery.
To boot up from a second Mac connected by a FireWire cable, follow these
steps:
1. Connect the second Mac to your Mac using a FireWire cable.
2. Turn on the working Mac.
3. Turn on the defective Mac (the one that’s having startup troubles) and
hold down the T key.
When the defective Mac’s hard drive appears as an external drive on the
working Mac, you can copy your important files off the hard drive or run
a utility program to fix the hard drive on the defective Mac. After copy-
ing files or repairing the hard drive, you’ll need to disconnect the Fire-
Wire cable and restart both Macs.

Shutting Down Frozen or Hung Up Programs
171
Shutting Down Frozen or Hung Up Programs
Programs might occasionally run perfectly fine, but suddenly when you try
to do anything with them, nothing happens no matter which keys you press
or where you click the mouse. Sometimes you might see a spinning wait
cursor (also called a “spinning pizza” or a “spinning beach ball of death”),
which stays on the screen and never goes away.
If you wait a few minutes, such frozen or hung up programs might eventually
recover and allow you to use them again. More often, however, the spinning
wait cursor keeps spinning in an oh-so-annoying fashion. To end the tor-
ment, you need to force quit the frozen or hung up program — basically, you
shut it down so that the rest of your Mac can get back to work. To force quit
a program, choose one of the following methods:
✦Right-click the program’s icon on the Dock and choose Force Quit from
the menu that appears.
✦Choose Ú➪Force Quit to display the Force Quit Applications dialog, as
shown in Figure 9-1. Then select the name of the hung-up program and
click the Force Quit button.
✦Press Option+Ô+Esc to display the Force Quit Applications dialog (see
Figure 9-1). Then select the name of the hung-up program and click the
Force Quit button.
✦Load the Activity Monitor program (located inside the Utilities folder in
the Applications folder ), select the program name as shown in Figure 9-2,
and then choose View➪Quit Process. A Quit Process dialog appears.
Click Force Quit.

2. Type top and press Return. 
The Terminal window displays a list of all programs currently running,
as shown in Figure 9-4.
3. Under the COMMAND column, look for the name of the program you
want to force quit.
Sometimes only an abbreviated form of the complete program name
appears, rather than the full name.
4. In the PID (Process ID) column, find the number that appears to the
left of the program name; write this PID number down. 
5. Type q. 
The Terminal window removes the list of running programs and waits
for your next command, as shown in Figure 9-5.
6. Type kill ### and press Return, where ### is the PID number of the
program you wrote down from Step 4. 
This force quits your chosen program.
If you can’t kill a program using the normal kill ### command, try
kill -9 ###, where ### represents the PID number of the program
you want to kill. This -9 option can usually kill programs that the ordi-
nary kill command can’t.

Removing Jammed CDs/DVDs
If a CD/DVD gets jammed into your Mac’s CD/DVD drive, you can try one (or
more) of the following methods to eject the CD/DVD:
✦Press the Eject key on your keyboard.
✦Drag the CD/DVD icon off the desktop and over the Trash icon on the
Dock.
✦Choose Ú➪Restart, and hold down the mouse or trackpad button while
your Mac boots up.
✦Click the Eject button next to the CD/DVD icon in the Sidebar of a Finder.
✦Click the Eject button next to the CD/DVD icon in iTunes.
✦Choose Controls➪Eject DVD from inside the DVD Player program.
✦Load the Disk Utility program (located in the Utilities folder inside the
Applications folder), click the CD/DVD icon, and click the Eject icon.
✦Click to select the CD/DVD icon on the Desktop and choose File➪Eject
from the main menu.
✦Click to select the CD/DVD icon on the Desktop and press Ô+E.
✦Right-click the CD/DVD icon on the Desktop and choose Eject from the
menu that appears.
Although it might be tempting, don’t ram tweezers, a flathead screwdriver,
or any other object inside your CD/DVD drive to pry a jammed disc out. Not
only can this scratch the disc surface, but it can also physically damage the
CD/DVD drive.

Repairing and Maintaining Hard Drives
175
Repairing and Maintaining Hard Drives
Hard drives can fail in two ways. First, the data could get scrambled on the
hard drive, confusing your Mac and making it impossible to read data from
it. If data gets scrambled, you can often reorganize your data (using a disk
utility program) and get your hard drive back in working condition again. 
Second, the surface of your hard drive might be physically damaged. If this
occurs, your only option is to copy critical files off the damaged hard drive
(if possible) and replace it with a new one. (If you run a disk utility program
and it fails to repair any problems on your hard drive, this might be a sign
that your hard drive surface is physically damaged.
The Disk Utility program that comes free with every Mac — tucked away in
the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder, if you’re curious — can
examine your hard drive, but to fix any problems it might find, you have to
boot your Mac from a different hard drive or from the Disk Utility CD/DVD
that came with your Mac.
In the following sections, I show you the tools for figuring out which problem
you have and what to do to fix it.
Verifying a disk
If you suspect that your hard drive might be scrambled or physically dam-
aged, you can run the Disk Utility program to verify your suspicions. When
using Disk Utility, select a device and choose one of the following:
✦Verify Disk: Checks to make sure all the files on that device are neatly
organized.
✦Verify Disk Permissions: Checks to make sure all files, installed with
each program, maintain the permissions originally assigned. (Permis-
sions apply only to your startup disk.)
The Disk Utility program can verify and repair all types of storage devices,
including hard drives, flash drives, and other types of removable storage
media such as compact flash cards.
To verify a disk, follow these steps:
1. Load the Disk Utility program (stored inside the Utilities folder in the
Applications folder).
The Disk Utility window appears.
2. Click the device (hard drive, flash drive, and so on) that you want to
verify in the left pane of the Disk Utility window. (See Figure 9-6.)

Repairing and Maintaining Hard Drives
176
3. Make sure the First Aid pane is visible. (If not, click the First Aid tab
to call it up.)
4. Click the Verify Disk button. 
The Disk Utility program examines your chosen device. If Disk Utility
can’t verify that a device is working, you see a message informing you
that First Aid feature of Disk Utility has failed, as shown in Figure 9-7.

5. Click OK and then click the Repair Disk button. 
You can do this step only with a non-startup disk.
Disk Utility tries to fix your device. If it succeeds, you see a message
informing you that the device is now repaired.
You can verify your hard drive to identify any problems, but you cannot
repair your startup hard drive using the copy of Disk Utility stored on your
startup hard drive. To repair your startup hard drive, you need to follow
these steps:
1. Insert your Mac OS X install disc that came with your Mac.
The Mac OS X installation disc contains the Disk Utility program to help
you troubleshoot your startup disk.
2. Restart your Mac by choosing Ú➪Restart.
The Restart dialog appears.
3. Click Restart or just wait a few minutes until your Mac restarts 
automatically. 
4. Hold down the C key while your Mac restarts. 
You can release the C key when you see your Mac starting to boot up,
such as displaying the Apple logo on the screen.
This boots your Mac off the Mac OS X install disc. Your Mac starts up 
its Mac OS X installation program and displays a list of languages to
choose.
Booting and running off your install disc can be slow, so be patient. 
5. Select the language you want to use and click the arrow button in the
bottom-right corner of the window.
An Install Mac OS X window appears.
6. Choose Utilities➪Disk Utility from the main menu.
The Disk Utility window appears.
7. Click the startup drive in the left pane of the Disk Utility window.
8. Make sure the First Aid pane is visible. (If not, click the First Aid tab
to call it up.)
9. Click the Repair Disk button.
The Repair feature of Disk Utility does what it can to fix any problems on
your hard drive and informs you of its success — or failure.
10. Choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility. 
The Install Mac OS X window appears again.

Repairing and Maintaining Hard Drives
178
11. Choose Installer➪Quit Installer. 
A dialog appears asking Are you sure you want to quit the
Installer?”
12. Click the Restart button in the dialog.
Verifying disk permissions
Disk permissions apply to your startup disk and define what each program’s
files are allowed to access. If permissions aren’t correct, your files could get
scrambled, which can cause your Mac to act erratically or fail completely. 
Disk permissions are similar to user permissions. With disk permissions, cer-
tain files are granted access to different parts of the computer. With user
permissions, certain users are granted access to different files and folders
stored on the hard drive.
Unlike repairing a hard drive, you can verify and fix disk permissions without
having to boot up from a separate hard drive or CD/DVD.
To verify disk permissions, follow these steps:
1. Load the Disk Utility program (stored inside the Utilities folder in the
Applications folder).
The Disk Utility window appears.
2. Click on your startup hard drive in the left pane of the Disk Utility
window.
3. Make sure the window is on the First Aid pane. (If not, click the First
Aid tab to call it up.)
4. Click Verify Disk Permissions.
If Disk Utility finds any problems, it displays a message to let you know.
Otherwise it displays a message to let you know all permissions are okay
as shown in Figure 9-8.
5. Click Repair Disk Permissions. 
Disk Utility displays any messages concerning permission problems it
found and repaired.
6. Choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility.

Preventative Maintenance
Your Mac has daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance tasks that it runs peri-
odically early in the morning (from 3:15 a.m. to 5:30 a.m.). If you leave your
Mac on at night, it can perform these routine maintenance tasks all by itself.
However, if your Mac is asleep during this time, it won’t run these mainte-
nance tasks.
You can wake yourself up between 3:15 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. every day and
jiggle the mouse around to keep your Mac awake so it can run its mainte-
nance tasks, or you can force your Mac to run its daily, weekly, and monthly
maintenance tasks right now.
To automate running your Mac preventative maintenance programs, con-
sider getting a free program called MacJanitor (http://personalpages.
tds.net/~brian_hill/macjanitor.html).
To force your Mac to run its maintenance tasks, follow these steps:
1. Load the Terminal program (located in the Utilities folder inside the
Applications folder).
The Terminal window appears (refer to Figure 9-3).

nance task is done when you see the cryptic-looking prompt (like
mycomputer$) reappear. 
3. Type your password and press Return.

 Understanding audio file formats
 Playing audio files with iTunes
 Burning audio files to disc
S
ince lugging around a case full of CDs (or even vinyl records or audio
tapes) is cumbersome and bulky, more people are storing music as digi-
tal audio files. Not only are digital audio files much easier to store and copy,
but storing individual songs as digital audio files means you need to carry
only the songs you want to hear. 
Besides storing music, audio files can also contain speeches, interviews,
and radio shows. Many audio files that contain interviews or entire radio
shows are called podcasts because they’re commonly played on iPods.
Understanding Audio File Formats
Audio files offer tremendous advantages in storage and audio quality com-
pared to previous forms of audio storage. However, there are literally
dozens of different audio file formats out there, so to hear different audio
files you may need to use different programs. This would be like having to
buy two separate radios where one radio can receive only AM stations and
the second radio can receive only FM stations.
Different types of audio file formats exist because each file format offers cer-
tain advantages. The three most popular types of audio file formats are
✦Lossless
✦Lossless compression
✦Lossy compression
Any audio file format can be played on any computer with the right software.

Understanding Audio File Formats
184
Lossless audio files
The highest-quality audio files are called lossless because they never lose
any audio data. As a result, lossless audio files offer the highest-quality
sound, but they also create the largest file sizes.
The two most popular lossless audio file formats are WAV (Waveform audio
format) and AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format). WAV files typically end
with the .wav file extension, whereas AIFF files typically end with the .aiff
or .aif file extension. 
Both WAV and AIFF audio files are different ways to hold audio stored in the
PCM (pulse code modulation) format. When you buy an audio CD of your
favorite band, that CD stores music in the PCM format as well.
Compressed lossless audio files
Lossless audio files take up large amounts of space, so compressed lossless
audio files are designed to squeeze audio data into a smaller file size. Three
popular compressed lossless audio file formats are FLAC (which stands for
Free Lossless Audio Codec), Shorten, and Apple Lossless.. FLAC files typi-
cally end with the .flac file extension, Shorten files typically end with the
.shn file extension, and Apple Lossless files typically end with the .m4a file
extension.
You can play Apple Lossless files in iTunes, but not FLAC or Shorten audio
files. To play FLAC files, grab a free copy of SongBird (www.songbirdnest.
com) or VLC Media Player (www.videolan.org/vlc). To play Shorten files,
use Audion (www.panic.com/audion).
Compressed lossy audio files
A lossy audio file simply compresses a file by tossing out audio data to
shrink the file size, much like pulling unnecessary clothing out of a suitcase
to lighten the load. The greater the audio quality, the more audio data the
file needs to retain and the bigger the file. The smaller the file, the less audio
data the file can hold, and the lower the audio quality. As a result, most
audio file formats strive for an optimal balance between audio quality and
file size. 
The amount of data an audio file format retains is measured in kilobits per
second (Kbps). The higher the kilobits, the more data stored and the higher
the audio quality. Table 1-1 shows approximate kilobit values and the audio
quality they produce.

Good quality, but differences from the original
audio source can be noticeable
192 Kbps
Medium quality, slight differences from the original
audio source can be heard
224–320 Kbps
High quality, little loss of audio quality from the 
original source
The most popular compressed lossy audio file formats are MP3 (MPEG-1
Audio Layer 3), AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), and WMA (Windows Media
Audio). MP3 audio files are the most popular because the MP3 audio file
standard was one of the first compression file formats that could smash
audio files to a smaller size while still retaining much of their audio quality.
You can recognize MP3 audio files by their .mp3 file extension.
Because the MP3 audio file format is copyrighted, programmers have cre-
ated a free equivalent audio file format called Ogg Vorbis, which uses the
.ogg file extension. Ogg Vorbis offers slightly higher audio quality and
slightly greater compression ratios. 
Another alternative to MP3 files is the AAC audio file format. Like Ogg Vorbis,
AAC audio files offer greater audio quality and smaller file compression than
equivalent MP3 files. Unlike the Ogg Vorbis format, the AAC format offers a
Streaming audio
Except for sound effects, most audio files are
several megabytes in size. Before you can play
such an audio file, you must first copy the entire
file to your computer. Normally, this isn’t a prob-
lem except if you want to listen to audio right
away. To solve this problem, you have to use
streaming audio.
Two features distinguish streaming audio from
ordinary audio files. First, streaming audio plays
as it’s being downloaded to your computer.
Second, streaming audio never gets saved to
your hard drive. 
The iTunes program (included with every Mac)
can play streaming audio. Some other popular
(and free) programs for listening to streaming
audio include Audion (www.panic.com/
audion), RealPlayer (www.real.com), and
AOL Radio (http://music.aol.com/
radioguide/bb).

digital rights management (DRM) feature that allows copy protection. AAC
files typically end with the .aac or .m4a file extension (if it does not have
digital rights management) or the .m4p file extension (if it does have digital
rights management).
To play Ogg Vorbis files, you need to convert them to MP3 or AAC files. One
way to convert Ogg Vorbis (or other types of audio files) into MP3 files is to
use the free audio-editing program, Audacity (http://audacity.source
forge.net) or the VLC Media Player (www.videolan.org/vlc).
Playing Audio with iTunes
You can buy audio files of your favorite songs from services such as the
iTunes Store. Perhaps the most popular way to get audio files is by import-
ing (also known as “ripping”) songs off an audio CD and storing them as
audio files on your hard drive.
When you have an audio file, you need a special program that can play that
audio file. To play the three most common audio files (MP3, AAC, and WAV)
on your Mac, you can use iTunes. The iTunes program is a combination
audio and video player, audio file converter, and disc-burning program so
you can store your favorite audio files on a CD that you can play in your
stereo.
You don’t have to use iTunes to play audio CDs and digital audio files on
your Mac. You can always use another audio player on your Macintosh
(such as RealPlayer, which you can get for free at www.real.com, VLC
Media Player at www.videolan.org/vlc, or Audion at www.panic.com/
audion). Other audio players can be especially useful if you want to play
oddball audio formats like Ogg Vorbis or FLAC, but in most cases, you’ll
probably find that iTunes works just fine.
Listening to CDs
You probably have audio CDs of your favorite albums, but rather than play
them in a CD player, you can play them in your Mac by using iTunes. Much
like a CD player, iTunes can play audio tracks on a CD in order or randomly.
Even better, iTunes lets you selectively choose which audio tracks you want
to hear. To play an audio CD in iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Insert an audio CD into your Mac.
A dialog appears, asking whether you want to import all audio tracks on
the CD into iTunes.

Book II
Chapter 1
Playing with Audio
Playing Audio with iTunes
187
If you click Yes, iTunes makes copies of all the audio tracks on the CD,
converts the copies into digital audio files, and then stores these new
copies on your hard drive — a process known as ripping.
2. Click No.
The dialog disappears. If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes dis-
plays the name of your album along with the names of every audio track,
as shown in Figure 1-1.
3. Click the Play button or press the space bar to start playing your
selected audio tracks. 
The Play button turns into a Pause button. 
Here are some tricks you can use to enhance your CD-listening experience:
✦Volume slider: Drag the volume slider to adjust the sound. 
✦Selective play: Deselect the check boxes of the audio tracks you don’t
want to hear. 
✦Random play: Choose Controls➪Shuffle to play your audio tracks in
random order. Choosing the Shuffle command again turns off random
play. You can keep turning this command off and on multiple times until
you see a random order that you like.

✦Adjust play: Click one of the following buttons:
• Pause: Temporarily stops playing audio. 
• Previous: Starts playing the currently selected audio track from the
beginning. Clicking the Previous button a second time starts playing
the previous audio track from the beginning.
• Next: Skips the currently selected audio track and starts playing the
next audio track.
When you’re listening to an audio CD, you can eject it by choosing Controls➪
Eject Disc or clicking the Eject Disc icon.
Converting an audio disc into digital files
Having to insert a CD into your Mac every time you want to hear a few songs
can be cumbersome, which is why you might find it easier to store your
favorite songs as digital audio files instead. 
The process of converting audio tracks on a CD into digital audio files is
known as ripping.
To convert an audio disc into digital files, follow these steps:
1. Insert an audio CD into your Mac. 
A dialog appears, asking if you want to import all audio tracks on the CD
into iTunes.
2. Click Yes if you want to convert every audio track into a digital audio
file. 
The iTunes program plays your audio CD while it’s copying all audio
tracks to digital audio files. If you want to choose which files to select,
click No and continue following the remaining steps.
3. Choose iTunes➪Preferences. 
The iTunes Preferences window appears.
4. Click the Advanced icon.
5. Click the Importing tab. 
The Importing pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-2.

8. Click the Setting pop-up menu and choose the audio quality for your
files. 
The higher the audio quality, the larger the file size.
9. (Optional) Select or deselect one or more of the following check boxes:
• Play songs while importing or converting: Lets you hear your audio
tracks as iTunes converts them to digital files.
• Automatically retrieve CD track names from Internet: Identifies audio
tracks by their song titles. If this option isn’t selected, each audio
track will have a generic name like Track 1.
• Create file names with track number: Adds the track number to each
digital file such as 01 – TrackName.
• Use error correction when reading Audio CDs: Increases the chances
that iTunes can retrieve and convert an audio track from a damaged
or scratched CD.
10. Click OK.
You’re brought back to the main iTunes window.
11. Deselect the check boxes of the songs you don’t want to import. 
Check marks should appear in the check boxes of the audio tracks you
want o import.
12. Click Import CD (the button appears in the lower-right corner of the
iTunes window). 
Your selected audio tracks get stored as digital audio files inside an
iTunes folder, tucked inside the Music folder. 
Importing digital audio files
Besides ripping audio tracks off a CD and storing them on your Mac, you
might also get digital audio files from other people either through the
Internet or handed to you on a flash drive. Before you can play any digital
audio files in iTunes, you must first import those files, which essentially
copies those digital audio files into the iTunes folder inside your Music
folder. Until you import audio files into iTunes, you won’t be able to play
those audio files.

You might have to search for that file in different folders.
4. Click the Choose button. 
Sorting your digital audio files
After you’ve stored some digital audio files in iTunes, you can sort through
them to find the audio files you want. The iTunes program offers three differ-
ent ways to display your audio files:
✦List view: Displays audio files alphabetically by category, such as name,
album, artist, or genre.
✦Album view: Displays audio files grouped alphabetically by album
name.
✦Cover Flow view: Identical to the album view except that it displays
album covers as 3-D images.

Displaying audio files in List view
The List view is best suited when you want to see as many names of your
audio files as possible. In the List view, you can sort your audio files alpha-
betically so you can group audio files into different categories such as by
Artist or Album. To see the List view, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, choose View➪List View (or click the List View icon).
The List view appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
2. Click a category heading, such as Name or Artist. 
When you click a category heading, iTunes sorts your entire audio file
collection alphabetically in ascending order based on that category. If
you click the same category again, iTunes sorts your audio files alpha-
betically in descending order.
The List view makes it easy to find audio files from different artists. 
Displaying audio files in Album view
The Album view visually groups songs next to specific album cover. If you
find the List view too boring because it displays only text, try the Album
view instead. To see the Album view, follow these steps:

1. In iTunes, choose View➪Album View (or click the Album View icon). 
The Album view appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.
2. Use the scroll bars to view your favorite songs, organized according to
album.
Displaying audio files in Cover Flow view
Another way to sort through your audio file collection is with the Cover Flow
view, which mimics the appearance of displaying album covers in a juke box,
where you can flip through different album covers to find the songs you
want to play. Like the Album view, the Cover Flow view lets you browse
through your favorite songs sorted according to the album that they came
from. 
When displayed in the Album view, album covers may appear more than
once. When displayed in the Cover Flow view, album covers appear only
once.
To download album cover artwork, you need an iTunes account. To create
an iTunes account, choose Store➪Create Account. Creating an account won’t
cost you anything, but you will need to enter a credit card number in case
you decide to buy anything from the iTunes online store.

Playing digital audio files
After you’ve imported one or more audio files into iTunes, you can view your
list of audio files within the iTunes window, as outlined in the previous sec-
tion. To play one or more digital files, follow these steps:
1. Choose a view for displaying your audio file collection, such as List,
Album, or Cover Flow view.
Check marks appear in the check boxes of all currently selected songs.
2. Select the check boxes of the audio tracks you want to hear and dese-
lect the check boxes of audio tracks you don’t want to hear. 
To deselect all audio tracks so you don’t have to listen to them, hold
down the Ô key and select a check box. To reselect all audio tracks,
repeat the process.

Using a playlist
One problem with playing digital audio files is that you must keep selecting
the songs you want to hear. Rather than go through the hassle of selecting
the same group of songs over and over again, you can select a group of
songs once and store that list as a playlist. Now if you want to hear a group
of songs, just select the playlist rather than each song individually.
You can create two types of playlists: an ordinary playlist and a Smart
Playlist. An ordinary playlist is just a list of your favorite songs. A Smart
Playlist lets you define rules for which songs to include, such as only songs
that recorded by specific artists. As your audio file collection grows, a Smart
Playlist can automatically include any new songs. 
When you create an ordinary play list or a Smart Playlist, those playlists
appear in the left pane of the iTunes window. By default, iTunes already
includes several Smart Playlists labeled Recently Added or Top 25 Most
Played.
Playlists simply show you a group of related songs to make it easier to find
the songs you want to hear.
Creating a playlist
The simplest playlist to create is one that contains specific songs, such as
love songs or songs from your childhood. To create a playlist, follow these
steps:
1. In iTunes, hold down the Ô key and click each song you want to store
in your playlist.
2. Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. 
An untitled playlist appears in the left pane of iTunes under the Playlists
category, and your chosen songs appear in the right pane.
3. Type a name for your playlist.
You can always edit a playlist name by double-clicking the name in the left
pane.
Adding songs to a playlist
After you’ve created a playlist, you can always add or remove songs to that
playlist at any time. To add a song to a playlist, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, move your cursor over a song you want to add to your
playlist.

Book II

2. Click and drag the song onto the name of the playlist in the left pane
of the iTunes window. 
3. Release the mouse button when the pointer appears over your chosen
playlist.
Putting a song in a playlist doesn’t physically move the song. 
Deleting songs from a playlist
To delete a song from a playlist, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, click the playlist that contains the songs you want to delete
from that playlist. 
The right pane of iTunes shows all the songs in your chosen playlist.
2. Click a song to delete.
3. Choose Edit➪Delete. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to remove the song
from your playlist.
4. Click Remove.
Deleting a song from a playlist doesn’t delete the song from your iTunes
library. 
To delete a song from your music collection, click Music under the Library
category in the left pane of the iTunes window. Then right-click a song you
want to delete and choose Delete. When a dialog appears, asking whether
you want to delete the song from your library, click Remove. When a second
dialog appears, click Move to Trash.
Creating a Smart Playlist
Manually adding and removing songs from a playlist can get tedious, espe-
cially if you keep adding new songs to your audio file collection. Instead of
placing specific songs in a playlist, a Smart Playlist lets you define specific
criteria for what types of songs to store in that playlist, such as songs
recorded earlier than 1990 or songs under the Psychedelic Rock genre. 
The three parts to using a Smart Playlist are
✦Tagging songs
✦Creating Smart Playlist rules to define which songs to include
✦Editing existing Smart Playlists

Playing Audio with iTunes
198
Tagging songs
To accurately sort your song collection into Smart Playlists, you must first
tag every song. Most songs, stored as digital audio files, already have some
information stored in specific tags, such as the artist or album name. How-
ever, you might still want to edit or add new tags to help Smart Playlists sort
your song collection.
To edit or add tags to a song, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, click a song that you want to tag.
2. Choose File➪Get Info (or press Ô+I). 
An Info window appears.
3. Click the Info tab. 
The Info pane displays text boxes where you can type the song info,
including album name, artist, and year recorded, as shown in Figure 1-8.
4. Click in a text box and edit or type information.

7. Click in the My Rating box and choose one to five stars.
8. Click OK.
Defining a Smart Playlist rule
Smart Playlists use tags to automatically sort and organize your song collec-
tion. After you’ve added tags to your songs, you can create a Smart Playlist
and define the type of songs you want that Smart Playlist to store. The spe-
cific criterion for choosing a song is called a rule.

After you’ve created a Smart Playlist, you might want to go back and modify
the way it works, such as adding more rules or editing any existing rules. To
edit a Smart Playlist, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, select the Smart Playlist that you want to edit in the left
pane of the iTunes window.
2. Choose File➪Edit Smart Playlist. 
The Smart Playlist dialog box appears (refer to Figure 1-10).
3. Make any changes to your Smart Playlist rule and click OK when
you’re done. 
Deleting a playlist
If you create a playlist or a Smart Playlist, you might want to delete that list
later. To delete a playlist, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, click a playlist that you want to delete in the left pane of
the iTunes window.
2. Choose Edit➪Delete. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete your playlist.
Deleting a playlist doesn’t physically delete the audio files from your
iTunes library.
3. Click Delete.
Burning an Audio CD
After you’ve collected your favorite songs in digital audio files, you might
want to save these files on a custom CD (often called a mix CD or just a mix)
that you can play in your car or home stereo. To burn an audio CD, first
create a playlist and then tell iTunes to copy all the songs in your playlist to
an audio CD.

CDs can hold approximately 70–80 minutes worth of audio. More stereos can
recognize and play CD-Rs although newer stereos can also recognize and
play CD-RWs as well. (CD-Rs let you write to them exactly only once. CD-RWs
let you erase and reuse them.)
To burn a disc using a playlist, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, choose iTunes➪Preferences.

Chapter 2: Playing with Pictures
In This Chapter
 Understanding digital photography
 Transferring pictures to your Mac
 Capturing pictures
 Editing pictures
M
ore people are taking pictures than ever before with digital cameras.
Digital cameras let you capture a picture, see it right away, and then
decide whether you want to keep it. Even better, after you’ve captured a pic-
ture, you can edit it to make it look better than it actually did in real life.
With a little bit of creativity, you can even alter a digital image to create an
image that never existed in the first place, such as pasting a horn on a horse
to create a picture of a unicorn or adding a tentacle protruding from your
mother-in-law’s forehead. 
Understanding Digital Photography
Instead of using film, digital photography captures images on memory stor-
age devices. Not only does this make storing digital photographs easy on a
computer, it also means you can make identical copies of your pictures at
any time without losing the quality of your images. “Great,” you say, but
keep in mind that, when using a digital camera, you need to understand how
digital cameras store images so you can transfer them to your Mac.
Understanding megapixels
Digital photographs capture images as a collection of tiny dots called pixels.
A single picture consists of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of pixels.
The greater the number of pixels used to create a picture, the sharper the
overall image. To help you understand the capabilities of different digital
cameras, manufacturers identify cameras by how many millions of pixels
they can capture in each picture. This total number of pixels, called the reso-
lution, ranges from 2 megapixels (MP) to 16 megapixels or more. Figure 2-1
shows how pixels create an image.

Understanding Digital Photography
206
Generally speaking, the higher the megapixels of a digital camera, the
sharper the image resolution. A picture captured with a 2-megapixel camera
won’t look as sharp as that same image captured with an 8-megapixel
camera, especially if you enlarge it. 
Understanding flash memory cards
Every time you take a picture with a digital camera, your camera needs to
save that picture somewhere. Some digital cameras come with built-in
memory, which can temporarily store any digital images that you capture.
However, to store large numbers of pictures, most digital cameras can also
store pictures on removable storage devices called flash memory cards. 
Okay, in no particular order now, here are things to keep in mind about flash
memory cards:
✦Reuse: The biggest advantage of flash memory cards over film is that
you can erase and reuse flash memory cards. Basically you can take as
many pictures as the flash memory card can hold, copy your pictures to
your Macintosh, and then erase the pictures off the flash memory card
so you can use it again. 
✦Resolution versus storage: The number of pictures you can store on
flash memory cards depends on the resolution of the pictures you take.
Figure 2-1:
Every digital
photograph
is made up
of pixels.

Book II
Chapter 2
Playing with
Pictures
Understanding Digital Photography
207
If you capture pictures at a high resolution, you can store far fewer 
pictures than if you captured those same pictures at a much lower 
resolution. 
✦Storage and speed measurement: Flash memory cards are often meas-
ured in terms of their storage size and speed. The amount of storage a
flash memory card can hold is measured in megabytes (MB) and giga-
bytes (GB), such as 512MB or 2GB. The greater the storage capability of
a flash memory card, the higher the cost.
The speed of flash memory cards is often described as minimum read
and write speeds, measured in megabytes per second (MB/sec) such as
10MB/sec. The higher the write speed of a flash memory card, the faster
you can capture and store pictures. Sometimes the speed of a flash
memory card may also be described as a number — 60x, for example —
which basically tells you that the flash memory card is 60 times faster
than the original flash memory cards. 
✦Image recovery: If you ever accidentally erase a picture off a flash
memory card, don’t panic (and don’t store any more pictures on that
flash memory card). If you buy a special file-recovery program such as
MediaRECOVER (www.mediarecover.com) or Digital Picture Recovery
(www.dtidata.com), you can often retrieve deleted pictures from any
type of flash memory card. However, if you delete a picture and then
store more pictures on the flash memory card, the new pictures will
likely wipe out any traces of your deleted pictures, making it impossible
to retrieve the deleted pictures ever again. 
The following are the most popular flash memory cards:
✦Compact Flash Type I (CFI) and Compact Flash Type II (CFII)
✦Secure Digital (SD) and Plus Secure Digital (Plus SD)
✦Memory Stick (MS), Memory Stick Pro (MS Pro), Memory Stick Duo (MS
Duo), and Memory Stick Pro Duo (MS Pro Duo)
✦xD Picture Cards (xD)
The reason why so many different types of flash memory cards exist is
because each design is meant to set the “standard” for flash memory cards.
Unfortunately, every flash memory card has its limitations, so companies
keep coming up with newer designs to overcome these limitations. Because
so many “standards” exist, the end result is that there is no standard.
The following sections discuss the popular flash memory cards in more
detail.

Understanding Digital Photography
208
Compact Flash Type I and Type II
First introduced in 1994, Compact Flash cards were one of the first flash
memory cards available and also one of the largest. There are two types of
Compact Flash cards: Type I (3.3 mm thick), or CFI; and Type II (5.0 mm
thick), or CFII. 
Because of the thickness differences, make sure you use the right Compact
Flash cards for your digital camera and card reader. A digital camera and
card reader that can use a CFII card can also use a CFI card, but the reverse
isn’t true. Because of their thickness and durability, professional photogra-
phers often use Compact Flash cards. 
Secure Digital (Mini and Micro SD)
Secure Digital (SD) cards are much smaller than Compact Flash cards and
offer built-in encryption to prevent storing copyright infringing materials
such as illegal songs, although this encryption feature is rarely used. 
Because of their small size, Secure Digital cards are slowly evolving into the
standard for digital photography. Even smaller versions of Secure Digital
cards include Mini and Micro SD cards. 
Memory Stick, Memory Stick Pro, Memory 
Stick Duo, and Memory Stick Pro Duo
The Memory Stick format was developed by Sony, which means that only
Sony devices (digital cameras, video camcorders, and PlayStations) use
Memory Sticks for storing digital images. The original Memory Stick could
store a maximum of only 128MB of data, so Sony created the Memory Stick
Pro, which can hold up to 32GB worth of data. The Memory Stick Duo and
Memory Stick Pro Duo look like an original Memory Stick cut in half. 
Despite Sony’s backing, the Memory Stick format has never gained popular-
ity with other manufacturers. If you buy a Sony camera, you’ll probably be
stuck with using Memory Sticks, although some of the latest Sony cameras
now use Secure Digital cards instead.
xD Picture Cards
Olympus and Fuji film invented the xD Picture Cards to provide yet another
standard. Because the xD Picture Cards are fairly recent, far fewer cameras
use xD Picture Cards — with the exception, of course, of Olympus cameras
and some Fuji film cameras. An xD Picture Card is often more expensive than
other flash memory cards, making them less attractive.

Book II
Chapter 2

Transferring Digital Images to the Mac
209
Understanding digital image file formats
When you take pictures, your digital camera stores those pictures in a spe-
cific graphics file format. The three most common file formats for storing
digital photographs are
✦JPEG (Joint Photo Experts Group): JPEG is the most common file
format because it is recognized by most computers and offers the ability
to compress images to shrink the overall file size. (Compressing a JPEG
file means decreasing the number of colors used in an image, which
shrinks the file size but lowers the visual quality.)
✦TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): If picture quality is more important
than file size, save your pictures as TIFF files. You can still compress
TIFF files slightly, but TIFF files always retain all colors. As a result, a
compressed TIFF file is almost always larger than an equivalent com-
pressed JPEG file. 
✦RAW (which doesn’t stand for anything!): A third type of file format is
called RAW. RAW files offer greater visual quality; however, there is no
single RAW file format standard. As a result, every digital camera manu-
facturer offers its own RAW file format.
The biggest advantage is that RAW files allow for greater manipulation.
As a result, professional photographers often use RAW files for greater
control over manipulating their images. The biggest disadvantage is that
RAW images take up a large amount of storage space and take longer for
a digital camera to store them, which means you can’t capture images in
rapid succession like you can with JPEG files or ordinary film cameras. 
Ultimately, there is no single “best” file format. If a digital camera lets you
save images in different file formats, experiment to see which one you like
best. You might prefer one type of file format, such as JPEG, for ordinary use
but prefer RAW for capturing images in special situations such as taking pic-
tures of a landscape that won’t require capturing images quickly.
Transferring Digital Images to the Mac
To transfer pictures from a digital camera to your Mac, you have two
choices. First, you can connect your digital camera to your Mac by using a
USB cable. Second, pop the flash memory card out of your digital camera
and plug it into a card reader (which you have to buy separately) that’s
plugged into your Mac.
No matter which method you use, your Mac then treats all the images stored
on your digital camera’s flash memory card as just another external drive
that you can copy pictures from and paste them anywhere on your hard
drive (such as in the Pictures folder).

Transferring Digital Images to the Mac
210
When you connect digital camera to your Mac, it can automatically load a
program to retrieve those images. Two programs commonly used to load
digital images are iPhoto and the Image Capture program. 
If you organize pictures in iPhoto, make iPhoto your default application to
retrieve pictures from a digital camera. If you use a different program to
organize your pictures, make Image Capture your default application.
Defining a default program for retrieving images
If you need to transfer digital images from a camera to your Mac on a regular
basis, you can define a default program to use for retrieving these images by
following these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Click Applications in the Finder’s sidebar. 
The contents of the Applications folder appear in the right pane of the
Finder.
3. Double-click the Image Capture icon. 
The Image Capture window appears.
4. Choose Image Capture➪Preferences.
A Preferences window appears, as shown in Figure 2-2.
You can also define a default application through iPhoto and the iPhoto
Preferences window.
5. Click the When a Camera Is Connected, Open pop-up menu and
choose iPhoto or Image Capture. 
Figure 2-2:

1. Connect your digital camera to your Mac by using a USB cable.
The iPhoto window appears, allowing you to view all the images available.
2. Click an image that you want to transfer and click Import Selected. 
If you click Import All, iPhoto retrieves all pictures stored on your digital
camera.
To select multiple images, hold down the Ô key and click each picture
you want to import.
3. Choose iPhoto➪Quit iPhoto.
Retrieving images using Image Capture
If you defined Image Capture as the default program to run when you con-
nected a digital camera to your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Connect your digital camera to your Mac by using a USB cable.
The Image Capture dialog appears, asking where you want to store your
pictures as shown in Figure 2-3.
You can also use the Image Capture program to capture and copy images
from a scanner.
2. Click the Download Some button.

available, as shown in Figure 2-4.
3. Click an image that you want to transfer and click Download. 
To select multiple images, hold down the Command key and click on
each picture you want to import.
4. Click Cancel.
5. Choose Image Capture➪Quit Image Capture.
After you’ve copied pictures off your digital camera to your Mac, you’ll still
have to erase the pictures off your flash memory card if you want to reuse it
again.
A second way to transfer digital images is to use a separate device called a
card reader, which plugs into your Macintosh through a USB port. (You have
to buy a separate card reader if you want to use this method. Just yank the
flash memory card out of your digital camera and plug it into the card
reader. Your Mac now treats the flash memory card, through its card reader,
as an external storage device.
Never yank a flash memory card out of a card reader because doing so might
cause your Mac to scramble the data on that flash memory card. Before
physically removing a flash memory card from a card reader, choose one of
the following ways to safely remove a flash memory card from your Mac:
✦Drag the flash memory card icon to the Trash icon in the Dock to eject it.
✦Click the flash memory icon and choose File➪Eject.

Capturing Pictures from Other Sources
If you don’t have a separate digital camera, you might have a built-in digital
camera in your Macintosh. This built-in camera, called iSight, appears in all
newer Mac laptops and iMac models. To capture pictures using this built-in
camera, the simplest method is to use a program called Photo Booth.
If you’re the type who doesn’t like taking pictures, you might prefer copying
pictures off Web sites instead. By copying pictures off Web sites, you can
find images that you wouldn’t normally capture yourself, such as images of
fighting in the Middle East or pictures of mountain climbers scaling Mount
Everest.
Pictures stored on Web sites are usually copyrighted, so you cannot legally
capture those pictures and reuse them for commercial purposes. 
Capturing pictures with Photo Booth
If your Mac comes with an iSight camera built-in, you can capture pictures of
yourself (or whoever’s sitting in front of your Mac), using the Photo Booth
program. When you take pictures using Photo Booth, your pictures get
saved as JPEG files in a Photo Booth folder, tucked inside your Pictures
folder.
To capture pictures with Photo Booth, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Click Applications in the Finder’s sidebar. 
The contents of the Applications folder appear in the right pane of the
Finder.
3. Double-click the Photo Booth icon. 
The Photo Booth window appears, displaying the current image seen
through the iSight camera, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Capturing Pictures from Other Sources

If you click the Effects button, you can capture a picture using visual
effects such as fish-eye or in front of a background such as the Eiffel
Tower. 
4. Choose File➪Take Photo (or press Ô+T). 
Photo Booth counts down from 3, 2, and 1 before capturing your picture.
Each captured picture appears at the bottom of the Photo Booth
window.
If you hold down the Option key while pressing Ô+T, Photo Booth will
take your picture right away without going through its usual 3, 2, 1
countdown.
5. Choose Photo Booth➪Quit Photo Booth when you’re done. 
Photo Booth stores its pictures in a Photo Booth folder, inside the
Pictures folder.
To erase all pictures captured by Photo Booth, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears.

2. Click Applications in the Finder’s sidebar.
The contents of the Applications folder appear in the right pane of the
Finder.
3. Double-click the Photo Booth icon. 
The Photo Booth window appears.
4. Choose Edit➪Delete All Photos. 
A dialog appears, asking if you really want to delete all your pictures
stored in the Photo Booth folder.
5. Click OK to delete them or Cancel (if you changed your mind).
When you choose the Delete All Photos command, you’ll remove all pictures
stored in the Photo Booth folder inside the Pictures folder.
Capturing pictures off Web sites
By browsing through different Web sites, you can find a variety of different
images that you might want to use for personal use, such as making greeting
cards with the President’s face on it. 
To capture images off a Web page, follow these steps:
1. Load your favorite Web browser, such as Safari.
2. Browse to a Web page and point the cursor at an image that you want
to copy.
As a general rule, don’t copy pictures off Web sites and reuse those pic-
tures on a commercial Web site due to copyright rules. 
3. Right-click (Control-click) over your chosen image. 
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 2-6.
4. Choose one of the following:
• Save Image to “Downloads”: Saves the picture in the Downloads
folder, stored inside your Home folder.
• Save Image As: Lets you choose a name for your picture and a folder
to store that picture.
• Add Image to iPhoto Library: Stores the image in iPhoto.
• Copy Image: Copies the image so you can paste it into another pro-
gram later.

Editing Digital Images
216
The Save Image As option is the only one that lets you choose your own
descriptive name for an image and specify the location where it is to be
saved. All the other options save an image using that image’s original
filename, which might be something cryptic like p009.jpg, although
you can always rename the file later if you want. 
Editing Digital Images 
One advantage that digital photographs have over traditional film is that you
can easily edit and modify digital photographs just by using your computer.
By controlling an image right down to the appearance of individual pixels,
digital editing gives you the power to enhance pictures, remove unwanted
portion of pictures, or create your own imaginary images from your fantasies
and dreams.
Editing a picture is typically a two-step process. First, you must select which
part of the picture you want to change. Second, you have to select a way to
change it, such as deleting or coloring it.
To change a picture, you can modify a single pixel by changing its color. If
you change the color of pixels, one by one, you’ll eventually change the
appearance of that picture.

Of course, modifying individual pixels can get tedious, so pixel editing is usu-
ally reserved for touching up small portions of an image. When faced with
major reconstruction work, it’s more common to modify an entire group of
adjacent pixels. In order to do that, you first have to select the part of the
picture you want to change.
To digitally edit a photograph, you need a digital editor such as one of the
following:
✦Photoshop or Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com): Photoshop is
the most popular (and expensive) program that graphics professionals
use to manipulate images. A much cheaper and simpler version is
Photoshop Elements, which offers the most commonly used features 
of Photoshop.
✦Photoline 32 (www.p132.com): A cross-platform (Windows and Mac)
program that offers a low-cost alternative to Photoshop. Besides editing
images, Photoline 32 can also create Flash and GIF animation.
✦PhotoStudio X (www.arcsoft.com): Provides a wealth of features
specifically designed for both modifying and organizing digital 
photographs. 
✦Pixen (http://opensword.org/Pixen): A free and simple image
editor specifically designed to modify pixels in pictures.
✦Pixel (www.kanzelsberger.com): A cross-platform image editor for
editing digital images or creating digital artwork on its own.
The examples in the following sections use Photoshop Elements but all
graphics editing programs work in similar ways.
Book IV, Chapter 1 provides more information about editing digital pictures
using iPhoto.
Selecting all or part of a picture
When you’re editing a digital photograph, you can select all or part of the
picture. In most digital-editing programs, the shortcut key for selecting an
entire image to change is Ô+A.
Selecting all of a picture lets you use effects such as changing a color picture
to black and white or brightening up the colors of an entire image, as shown
in Figure 2-7. 
Rather than change an entire picture, you might want to modify only part 
of a picture, such as highlighting a single object in a picture. You can also
create a new picture that combines both pictures in a unique manner, as
shown in Figure 2-8.

If you just want to select part of a picture, you have to use a selection tool.
Most image-editing programs offer four types of selections tools:
✦Rectangular: Selects a rectangular area of a picture.
✦Circular: Selects a circular area of a picture.
✦Lasso: Lets you drag the mouse around to define an area to select.
✦Magnetic Lasso: Lets you drag the mouse around to select color bound-
aries in a picture. This tool lets you select irregularly shaped objects,
such as a hand or a flower. 
The basic steps to selecting part of a picture are
1. Click a selection tool (Lasso, Rectangular, and so on) displayed in the
toolbox, which is a collection of icons that typically appear on the left
side of the window.
2. Drag the mouse over the part of the image you want to select.
As you drag the mouse, a dotted line appears that defines the area you
selected as shown in Figure 2-9.
After you select part of a picture, you can choose a command to modify just
that portion you selected, such as darkening or lightening or brightening the
colors. 
Changing colors
One common feature of digital editing programs is the ability to change
colors in an image, either by touching up existing colors to make them

A dotted
line, called 
a marquee,

selected
area.

brighter or by changing the colors altogether, such as turning a lady’s pink
scarf into a red one. 
Such color replacement features are the basis for red-eye removal tools
found in many digital editing programs. Red-eye often appears when the
camera’s flash makes a person’s eyes appear with a reddish glow as if
they’re radioactive. Obviously, such red eyes can ruin an otherwise perfectly
good picture, so red-eye removal tools basically replace the reddish tint in
an image with another color such as black. 
Of course, you can use the red-eye removal tool as a general color replace-
ment tool as well. That way you can create unusual effects, such as changing
someone’s dark hair into blazing purple and pink, or changing the color of
the sky from light blue to red.
The basic steps for using a red-eye removal tool are as follows:
1. Click the Red-Eye Removal Tool in the toolbox, which generally
appears on the left side of the window.
2. Click over the color that you want to replace (such as the red tint in a
person’s eye).
3. Click a color palette to choose a replacement color.
4. Drag the mouse over the part of your picture that you want to recolor.
If you drag the mouse over the color you selected in Step 2, your image-
editing program replaces the color with the replacement color you
chose in Step 3. If you drag the mouse over a different color than the one
you chose in Step 2, dragging the mouse does nothing. 
Adding and removing items in a picture
Part of the fun with digital photography is the ease with which you can add
or delete items in a picture. By adding items to a picture, you can create
unusual images that never existed, as shown in Figure 2-10.
The simplest way to add images is to copy all or part of a picture and paste
it over a second picture. Of course, this can look as sloppy as clipping a pic-
ture out of a magazine and pasting it over another picture. Another way to
add a picture is to follow these steps:
1. Copy (or cut) an image from a picture, such as a person or an animal.
2. Select an area in a second picture where you want to paste an image.
By selecting an area, your copied image won’t appear outside of the area
of this selected boundary. 

Book II
Chapter 2
Playing with
Pictures
Editing Digital Images
221
3. Paste the copied (or cut) image from Step 1 into the selected area from
Step 2.
To paste into a selected area, choose Edit➪Paste Into. Just be aware
that other types of image-editing programs might not have a Paste Into
command or might accomplish the same steps by using a different com-
mand altogether.
The preceding steps represent just one way to copy and paste an image into
a picture. There are dozens of ways to paste an image into a picture, depend-
ing on the features of your image-editing program.
Although adding images can create new pictures, removing items from a pic-
ture can clean up an image and make it more suitable for public viewing, as
shown in Figure 2-11.
Normally, if you select part of an image and delete it, you’ll leave a gaping
hole in the picture. To delete an image while filling in the deleted area, you
can use a special tool called a Clone Stamping Tool (which might go by dif-
ferent names in other image-editing programs).
The Clone Stamping Tool lets you copy and paste pixels from one part of a
picture to another. This lets you copy background images, such as a wall,
and paste it over someone’s face, effectively erasing that person’s face from
the picture.
Figure 2-10:
Adding
items to a

Editing Digital Images
222
To use a Clone Stamping Tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Clone Stamping Tool in the toolbox, which is a collection of
icons that typically appear on the left side of the window.
2. Click the part of the picture that you want to copy and paste to a new
area of the picture.
The point where you click is called an anchor point. To define this
anchor point, you might need to hold down a modifier key as you click,
such as the Option or Ô key, depending on your program.
3. Drag the mouse to “paint” over the picture with the image you clicked
in Step 2.
If you clicked a brick wall in Step 2, dragging the mouse in Step 3 would
paint that brick wall image over any part of your picture, effectively
“erasing” that object. You might have to repeat this process several
times to completely erase an image.

I
f you ever get bored, relax and watch a movie on your Mac. Not only can
your Mac act like a DVD player, but your Mac can also bookmark and
store your favorite scenes so you can always find your favorite parts of a
movie. 
Although many full-length movies appear on DVD, many shorter movies and
videos are stored entirely as digital video files. Whether a movie is stored on
DVD or as a digital video file, your Mac can play it at your convenience.
Understanding Video Disc Formats
The most common videodisc format is DVD (Digital Video Disc). However,
this isn’t the only videodisc format. An earlier video disc format is VCD
(Video Compact Disc), which essentially stores video files on ordinary CDs.
VCDs typically offer lower video quality than DVDs (comparable to video-
tape) and offer much less storage than DVDs.
Although DVDs are the current videodisc standard for most of the world,
two competing standards have emerged as successors to DVDs: HD DVD
(High-Definition Digital Versatile Disc) and Blu-ray discs.
HD DVD can store roughly three times as much data as ordinary DVDs
(15GB for HD DVD versus 4.7GB for DVDs). Because HD DVDs are similar to
ordinary DVDs, HD DVDs cost nearly the same to produce.
The main advantage of Blu-ray discs is that they can store much more data
than even HD DVDs (25GB for a Blu-ray disc versus 15GB for an HD DVD).
However, Blu-ray discs are also much more expensive to produce. 

Understanding Digital Video Formats
224
Currently, the Mac can play DVDs and VCDs out of the box, but if you want
to watch video stored on HD DVDs or Blu-ray discs, you need to buy a spe-
cial HD DVD or Blu-ray disc drive and a program to use it. 
Understanding Digital Video Formats
Video discs are popular for storing and distributing videos, but with high-
speed Internet connections and lower hard drive storage costs, storing full-
length movies as a single digital video file has become both popular and
practical. The biggest problem with digital video is the wide variety of digital
video formats available. To play a digital video file, you need a video player
program that accepts the type of video file you have. The following is a list of
digital video file types and the programs that you can use to play them: 
✦QuickTime (.mov): Playable by the QuickTime Player that comes with
every Mac.
✦Audio/Video Interleaved (.avi): An older video file format introduced
by Microsoft in 1992, although still commonly used today. To play AVI
video files on a Mac, you’ll need a separate video player such as the free
VLC media player (www.videolan.org).
✦Windows Media Video (.wmv): Playable on a Mac if you first install the
Flip4Mac program (www.flip4mac.com), which allows the QuickTime
Player to display Windows Media Video files.
✦DivX (.divx): A high-quality video format known for storing DVD-qual-
ity video images in a digital video file format. DivX files can be played on
a Mac with the free VLC media player (www.videolan.org) or the free
DivX player (www.divx.com).
Because DivX is a proprietary video file format, programmers have cre-
ated a similar open source equivalent called Xvid (www.xvid.org).
✦Flash video (.flv): A video file format commonly used on Web sites
such as news sites that offer video (CNN and Reuters) along with
YouTube, MySpace, and Yahoo! Video. You can play flash videos by using
the free Adobe Flash player (www.adobe.com).
✦RealVideo (.rm): A video file format often used for streaming video.
RealVideo files can be played and viewed using the free Real Player pro-
gram (www.real.com). 
✦Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG) (.mpg): A video file format that
consists of different versions, including 
• MPEG-1: Used for storing video on VCDs.
• MPEG-2: Broadcast-quality video such as on SVCDs, DVDs, HD TV, HD
DVDs, and Blu-ray discs.

Book II
Chapter 3
Watching Videos 
on a Mac
Playing a Digital Video File
225
• MPEG-3: Originally designed for HD TV but now rarely used.
• MPEG-4: For storing video on HD DVD and Blu-ray discs.
You can view MPEG videos with the QuickTime Player, the free VLC
media player (www.videolan.org), or the commercial MacVCD player
(www.mireth.com)
The QuickTime Player can’t play MPEG videos if the audio is stored as AC3
(Dolby Digital) files.
Most video players are free because the companies developing and pro-
moting a specific video file format want as many people as possible to use
(and rely on) their particular video file format. Then these companies 
can make money by selling programs that create and store video in their
specific file format.
Playing a Digital Video File
Playing a digital video file is as simple as double-clicking that file (or clicking
the video file once and choosing File➪Open), which opens the appropriate
video player on your Mac and displays your video file on the screen. If you
find a video file on a Web site, you can usually click the video file directly on
the Web page to see it play within your browser.
Occasionally, you might find a video file format that you can’t play on your
Mac. In this case, you have two choices:
✦Download and install a video player for that particular video file format.
✦Convert the video file into a format that your Mac can play.
Sometimes it might be simpler just to download and install (yet another)
free video player to watch video trapped in a different video file format.
However, downloading and installing multiple video players can be annoy-
ing, so you might prefer to convert digital file formats instead. To convert
digital video files, you need a special digital video file format conversion 
program.
To convert non-copy-protected DVD videos to a digital video file, such as 
an AVI or MPEG, you can use a free program called HandBrake (http://
handbrake.m0k.org). In case you need to convert one digital video file
format into another one (such as converting a DivX file into a QuickTime
file), grab a copy of the oddly named ffmpegX (www.ffmpegx.com) or 
MPEG StreamClip (www.squared5.com). 

Playing a DVD
226
By converting digital video files, you can store all your videos in a single file
format, such as QuickTime, to avoid having to download and install half a
dozen different video players just to watch one or two video files.
Playing a DVD
The most common video disc format is the DVD format. To play DVDs, just
insert your DVD into your Mac. DVD Player loads and displays your DVD’s
main menu, as shown in Figure 3-1.
To choose from a DVD menu, just double-click an option, such as Play Movie
or Special Features. Then sit back, pop some popcorn, and enjoy the show.
If you just want to watch a DVD from start to finish, you don’t have to read
the rest of this chapter. However, if you want to use some of the special fea-
tures of DVD Player, keep reading.
Understanding full screen mode and window mode
One of the simplest ways to customize your video is to switch back and
forth between full screen and window mode. In full screen mode, the video
fills your entire computer screen. In window mode, the video fills only 
part of your computer screen while giving you access to the rest of your 
Mac Desktop such as the Dock and other program windows, as shown in
Figure 3-2.

✦Half Size
✦Actual Size
✦Double Size
✦Fit to Screen
✦Enter Full Screen
When viewing a video in a window, the Controller takes on a different skin
(the display appearance), as shown in Figure 3-4.
Although the Controllers in both full screen and window mode allow you to
control a DVD, each Controller offers slightly different features. You can
access some features in both full screen and window mode, but many fea-
tures are available only in one mode or the other.
To avoid letting any other window cover up part of your video window,
choose View➪Viewer Above Other Apps. To turn off this feature, choose the
same command again.

Viewing the DVD and Title menus
Most DVDs include an initial menu that lets you choose what to watch, such
as the feature presentation or trivia clips. Some DVDs also offer a Title menu
that lets you pick different episodes, such as a DVD containing multiple
episodes from a single TV show season. Some DVDs offer both an initial
menu and a Title menu, and they might even start playing automatically.
To jump to the initial DVD or Title menu, try clicking the DVD Menu or the
Title Menu button on the Controller.
Not all DVDs have a DVD or Title menu. 
If you want to start the DVD from the very beginning just as if you inserted
the DVD into your Mac for the very first time, follow these steps:
1. If in full screen mode, move the pointer to the top of the screen to dis-
play the DVD Player menu bar.
2. Choose Go➪Beginning of Disc. 
Your DVD starts playing from the beginning.
Skipping through a video
Sometimes you might want to skip over or replay part of a video. To skip
backward or forward through a video, follow these steps:
1. Switch to full screen mode.
2. Click the Pause button.
3. Click one of the following buttons on the Controller:
• Rewind: Reverses the video a few frames and starts playing normally
again
• Fast Forward: Jumps the video ahead a few frames and starts playing
normally again
When you click the Rewind or Fast Forward buttons, the video jumps ahead
(or back) only a few frames. If you want to keep rewinding or fast-forwarding
continuously, follow these steps:
1. Switch to window mode.
2. Choose Controls➪Scan Forward (or Scan Backwards). 
Your video continuously rewinds or fast forwards.
3. Click the Play button on the Controller or press the spacebar to play
the video at its normal speed.

You can also drag the slider at the bottom of the Controller (in full screen
mode) to rewind or fast-forward a video.
Viewing frames in steps and slow motion
If you want to study a particular part of a video, the DVD Player lets you
view individual frames one at a time, or view your video in slow motion. To
view individual frames, follow these steps:
1. Switch to window mode.
2. Click the Step Frame button on the Controller. 
Each time you click the Step Frame button, the video advances one frame.
3. Click the Play button on the Controller, or press the space bar to play
the video at normal speed. 
Stepping through a video one frame at a time can get tedious, so a faster way
to step through a video is in slow motion. To view your video in slow motion,
follow these steps:
1. Switch to window mode.
2. Click the Slow Motion button on the Controller or choose Controls➪
Slow Motion. 
3. Click the Play button on the Controller, or press the space bar to play
the video at normal speed. 
Skipping by chapters
Most DVD videos are divided into segments called chapters, which are usu-
ally listed somewhere on or inside the DVD case. If you want to view a
favorite scene, just jump to the chapter that contains your favorite scene. 
To skip back to the previous chapter or forward to the next chapter, choose
one of the following:
✦Click the Previous Chapter or Next Chapter button on the Controller. 
✦Press the left- or right-arrow key while the video is playing.
To skip to a specific chapter, follow these steps:
1. If in full screen mode, move the pointer to the top of the screen to dis-
play the DVD Player menu bar.

Parental controls
If you don’t want your children watching certain DVDs, you can try turning
on DVD Player’s parental controls. These parental controls are designed
either to block certain types of DVDs from playing or to prevent certain
objectionable scenes from appearing while allowing the rest of the movie to
be seen. 
Because of the extra expense involved in adding parental control features to
a DVD, many DVDs don’t support parental controls. If you turn on parental
controls, it’s entirely possible to watch a totally inappropriate DVD on your
Mac — just because the DVD itself hasn’t been programmed to recognize any
of the DVD Player’s parental control features. 
To turn on (or off) parental controls, follow these steps:
1. If in Full Screen Mode, move the pointer to the top of the screen to
display the DVD Player menu bar.
2. Choose Features➪Enable Parental Controls. 
A dialog appears, asking for your password.
3. Type your password and click OK.
To disable parental controls, repeat the above steps, except in Step 2, and
choose Features➪Disable Parental Controls.
Defining DVD Player preferences
DVD Player offers six categories for modifying how to play DVDs:
✦General: Defines how DVD Player behaves when running, such as
whether to start in full screen mode.
✦Disc Setup: Defines the audio, subtitles, and DVD menus displayed.
✦Full Screen: Defines how other program windows behave when a video
appears in full screen mode.
✦Windows: Defines how to display closed captioning in a window.
✦Previously Viewed: Defines how to handle a DVD that has been ejected
and inserted back into your Mac, such as whether to start playing the
DVD at the beginning again or at the last scene viewed before you
ejected the DVD. 
✦High Definition: Defines how to play high-definition DVDs if you have a
HD DVD or Blu-ray drive attached to your Mac.

I
f you want to watch videos, play music, or browse through digital photo-
graphs, you could load QuickTime Player, iTunes, and iPhoto and search
for the videos, audio files, or pictures you want to hear or see. However, this
can be clumsy, especially if you want to play music and browse through
your photograph collection at the same time. 
To give you another way to access your video, audio, and digital images, the
latest Macs come with a program called Front Row. The whole purpose of
Front Row is to integrate the features of the QuickTime Player, iTunes, the
DVD Player, and iPhoto to make it easy for you to access your media with-
out having to load a bunch of separate programs to do it. 
Using the Apple Remote
The most common way to control Front Row is through the Apple Remote,
although you can also control Front Row through the keyboard (in case you
don’t have an Apple Remote). The Apple Remote provides the following con-
trols, as shown in Figure 4-1:
✦Up: Moves the highlighting up one option.
✦Down: Moves the highlighting down one option.
✦Next: Fast forwards a file or selects the next item.
✦Previous: Rewinds a file or selects the previous item. 

Using the Apple Remote
240
✦Play/Pause: Toggles between playing and pausing a file. Also used to
select a highlighted option.
✦Menu: Displays the initial Front Row menu. Also used to go back to a
previous menu.
Although the Apple Remote can control the Front Row program, it can also
control your Mac and other programs, such as Keynote, which can be 
handy if you want to control it from a distance, such as using a Mac to give
presentations. 
Making a Mac go to sleep
To make your Mac go to sleep using the Apple Remote, follow these steps:
1. Hold down the Play/Pause button. 
A sleeping Apple Remote icon appears on the screen.
2. Release the Play/Pause button. 
Your Mac obediently goes to sleep.
To wake up a sleeping Mac with the Apple Remote, just tap any button on
the Apple Remote. 
Booting up a Mac
If you’ve divided your hard drive into partitions and installed two different
operating systems (such as using Boot Camp to install Windows), you can
use the Apple Remote to help you choose which partition and operating
system to use by following these steps:

The hard drive icons that appear list all the bootable partitions you can
choose.
2. Press the Previous and Next buttons to select a hard drive.
3. Press the Play/Pause button to choose the selected hard drive.
Controlling applications
You can use the Apple Remote to control several popular programs, includ-
ing Keynote, iTunes, iPhoto, and DVD Player. 
The Apple Remote can control different programs, but it won’t let you
switch, open, or close programs. If you want to do this from a distance, use a
wireless keyboard and mouse.
Controlling a Keynote presentation
By using the Apple Remote with Keynote, you can give and control a presen-
tation without being near your Mac. To start a presentation, load Keynote and
your presentation using your keyboard or mouse. At this point, you can view
your presentation with the Apple Remote by pressing the Play/Pause button.
To view the next slide, press the Next button. To view the previous slide,
press the Previous button. If you press the Menu button once, Keynote dis-
plays thumbnails of your slides, as shown in Figure 4-2.

If you hold down the Menu button, Keynote exits your presentation and
returns you to the main Keynote screen.
Controlling iTunes
Using the Apple Remote with iTunes lets you control your music from across
the room. To start playing a song, load iTunes using the keyboard or mouse
and pick a playlist (or choose your entire music collection). At this point,
you can press the Play/Pause button on the Apple Remote. 
To start playing a song from the beginning, press the Previous button. If you
press the Previous button twice in rapid succession, iTunes starts playing
the previous audio track.
To jump to the next song, press the Next button. To raise the volume, press
the Up button. To lower the volume, press the Down button.
Controlling iPhoto
Using the Apple Remote with iPhoto lets you control a photo presentation at
a distance. To start showing a slideshow of all the images stored in iPhoto,
load iPhoto using the keyboard or mouse, pick an album that contains the
pictures you want to see, and then press the Play/Pause button on the Apple
Remote. 
To view the previous photograph, press the Previous button. To view the
next photograph, press the Next button. To exit from your slideshow, hold
down the Menu button. 
Controlling DVD Player
With the Apple Remote and DVD Player, you can watch movies on your Mac
while lounging on the sofa away from your desk. To start playing a DVD, load
a DVD into your Mac and wait for the DVD Player program to load. (If DVD
Player doesn’t load automatically, you have to open it in the Applications
folder using the keyboard or mouse.) After DVD Player starts running, you
can control it by pressing the Play/Pause button on the Apple Remote. 
To choose an option from the DVD menus, press the Previous/Next buttons
and select an option by pressing the Play/Pause button. To raise the volume,
press the Up button. To lower the volume, press the Down button. 
Pairing an Apple Remote with a Mac
If you have two or more Mac computers, an iPod, or an Apple TV unit in the
same room, your Apple Remote can accidentally control multiple items. In

Book II

case you want to make sure an Apple Remote works with only one Mac, you
can pair up that specific Apple Remote with one computer.
To pair an Apple Remote to a specific Mac, follow these steps:
1. Hold the Apple Remote 4 to 6 inches away from the infrared (IR) port
on the Mac you want it to control.
2. Press the Menu and Next buttons at the same time. 
After a few seconds, a paired-remote icon appears on the screen.
3. Release the Menu and Next buttons. 
Your Apple Remote is now paired to work only with that specific Mac.
To unpair an Apple Remote from a specific Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences on the Mac you want to unpair from
an Apple Remote. 
The System Preferences window appears. 
2. Click the Security icon under the Personal category. 
The Security window appears.
3. Click the General tab. 
The General options appear, as shown in Figure 4-3.

Accessing Front Row
244
Accessing Front Row 
You can easily control separate programs such as iTunes and DVD Player
with the Apple Remote, but you must manually switch between different pro-
grams just to hear music, watch a movie, or look at your digital photo-
graphs. To overcome the hassle of working with multiple programs, Front
Row provides a simple, consistent user interface for accessing all your
media files whether they’re stored in your Music, Movies, or Pictures folder. 
Before using Front Row, you need to store your favorite songs, podcasts, and
music videos in iTunes; your favorite pictures in iPhoto; and your favorite
movies in your Movies folder. Alternatively, you can have a CD or DVD in
your Mac.
Starting Front Row
To start Front Row, choose one of the following:
✦Press the Menu button on the Apple Remote.
If you have a program running that can accept commands from the
Apple Remote, such as Keynote, pressing the Menu button might control
that program instead of starting Front Row.
✦Double-click the Front Row icon in the Applications folder.
✦Press Ô+Esc.
Each time you start Front Row, the Front Row menu appears, as shown in
Figure 4-4.
The DVD option appears only if you have a DVD inserted in your Mac.
Highlighting an option in Front Row
To highlight an option on the Front Row menu, choose one of the following:
✦Press the Up/Down buttons on the Apple Remote.
✦Press the up- and down-arrow keys on the keyboard.
Selecting an option in Front Row
After you’ve highlighted an option on a Front Row menu, you can select that
option by choosing one of the following:
✦Press the Play/Pause button on the Apple Remote.
✦Press Return on the keyboard.

Understanding Apple TV
Front Row turns your Mac screen into an enter-
tainment center, but what if you have a 52-inch
high-definition TV in your living room? Rather
than use Front Row to watch a DVD on your
iMac’s 20-inch screen, you might want to play
that DVD on your 52-inch big-screen TV. In that
case, you can ignore your Mac completely and
buy a separate DVD player connected to your
big-screen TV, or you can get Apple TV and
control it using your Apple Remote.
Apple TV is nothing more than a box that phys-
ically connects to your TV through wires (which
you’ll have to buy separately from the Apple TV
unit). After you’ve connected Apple TV to your
TV screen, Apple TV wirelessly (or through
cables if you prefer) connects to your Mac (or
even a PC) to transfer movies from your com-
puter to the Apple TV unit, which then broad-
casts those movies on your big-screen TV.
Essentially, Apple TV acts like a wired or wire-
less connection between your Mac and your
big-screen TV for playing movies or TV show
episodes that you’ve downloaded from iTunes. 

Viewing Pictures
254
4. Select an audiobook title and press Play/Pause on the Apple Remote
(or press Return on the keyboard). 
Your chosen audiobook starts playing.
Viewing Pictures
If you have a bunch of photographs stored in iPhoto, you can view them in
Front Row as an ongoing slideshow. This can be convenient to show different
types of pictures during a party or family gathering. To view your iPhoto pic-
tures in Front Row, follow these steps:
1. Start up Front Row by pressing the Menu button on the Apple Remote
or by pressing Ô+Esc. 
The Front Row menu appears.
2. Select the Photos option and press Play/Pause on the Apple Remote
(or press Return on the keyboard). 
A Photos menu appears.
3. Select a photo album such as Photos or Last 12 Months, and then press
Play/Pause on the Apple Remote (or press Return on the keyboard). 
Your slideshow appears on the screen.

 Downloading files
You can use a computer all by itself, but to get the most out of your Mac,
you need an Internet connection. The Internet can also open up a
whole new world for you by letting you browse and read news, watch
movies, listen to radio stations, find and install new software, updated ver-
sions of your existing software, and shop online. For most people, an
Internet connection is no longer an option but a necessity.
Setting Up an Internet Connection
From a technical point of view, your Mac can’t connect directly to the
Internet. Instead, your Mac must connect to another computer, run by a
company called an Internet Service Provider (ISP); it’s through the ISP that
your Mac actually connects to the Internet. 
To connect your Mac to an ISP, you have three options:
✦Ethernet (also called high-speed or broadband)
✦Wireless
✦Dial-up access
Ethernet connection
An Ethernet connection, also known as a broadband connection, is the most
popular way to connect to the Internet. The two most common broadband

Setting Up an Internet Connection
258
connections are through cable modems or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
modems.
Ethernet cables have plugs that look like wider versions of a telephone plug.
After you connect an Ethernet cable to your Mac and a cable or DSL modem,
you can usually start using the Internet right away.
Macs can recognize an Ethernet Internet connection right away through
something called the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
Basically, DHCP means that your Mac is smart enough to connect to the
Internet without you having to type a bunch of cryptic numbers and fiddle
with confusing technical standards. 
For more information about setting up a network and sharing a single
Internet connection with multiple computers, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
Wireless access
Wireless access is popular because it allows you to connect to the Internet
without stringing cables across the room to trip over. Most new Macs
include built-in wireless capability, but if your Mac doesn’t have this, you’ll
have to buy a special wireless receiver that plugs into your Mac. 
If your Mac doesn’t have a built-in wireless receiver, you can choose the Airport
Extreme card (www.apple.com/airportextreme) that must be installed
inside your Mac. You can also choose from a variety of other wireless receivers,
such as the AfterTheMac wireless adapter (http://afterthemac.com)
that plugs into a USB port. 
After you have wireless access capability in your Mac, you need to connect
to a wireless Internet network (often called Wi-Fi). Public libraries and many
coffee houses offer free wireless Internet access, but you can set up your
own wireless network at home or work by using a wireless router, which lets
multiple computers share a single Internet connection. 
A wireless router connects to your cable or DSL modem and broadcasts
radio signals to connect your Mac wirelessly to the Internet. 
Apple sells a wireless router called the Airport Extreme base station
(www.apple.com/airportextreme), but you can actually buy any wire-
less router and hook it up to your high-speed Internet connection. The brand
name of your wireless router is less important than the speed offered by the
router, which is determined by the wireless standard the router uses. A wire-
less standard simply defines the wireless signal used to connect to the
Internet. Table 1-1 lists the different wireless standards.

The upload/download speed of wireless standards is measured in megabits
per second (Mbps) although this maximum speed is rarely achieved in
normal use. The speed and range of a wireless Internet connection will also
degrade over distance or if obstacles appear between the Wi-Fi router and
your Mac, such as walls or heavy furniture. 
To connect to a wireless network, you need to make sure your router and the
wireless receiver connected to your computer use the same wireless stan-
dard. If your router uses only the 802.11a standard but your computer can
use only the 802.11b standard, you won’t be able to connect.
Most routers and wireless receivers work with multiple standards. If you buy
an Apple Airport Extreme base station (transmitter) and an Airport Extreme
card (receiver), you won’t have to worry about these wireless standards. If
you buy a non-Apple wireless router, you might have to worry about which
wireless standard the router uses. 
The 802.11g wireless standard is currently the most popular wireless stan-
dard, but the newer 802.11n standard is becoming more popular because it
offers greater range and higher speeds. Most routers are compatible with
multiple standards, such as 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. The newer routers
also include compatibility with the 802.11n standard.
If your Mac has wireless capability, you can connect to a wireless network
(such as at a public library or coffeehouse) by following these steps:
1. Load the Safari browser (or any other browser). 
Safari displays a You are not connected to the Internet. Web
page, as shown in Figure 1-1. You also see a Network Diagnostics button.
2. Click the Network Diagnostics button. 
A Network Diagnostics dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-2.
3. Select the Airport radio button and then click Continue. 
The Network Diagnostics dialog displays a list of wireless networks that
you can connect to, as shown in Figure 1-3.

4. Select a wireless network name and click Continue. 
A message appears, letting you know that you have changed your net-
work settings, as shown in Figure 1-4.
On private wireless networks, an additional dialog might appear, asking
you to type a username and password.
5. Click OK.

The Network Diagnostics dialog tries to connect to your chosen wireless
network. If it succeeds, it displays a message as shown in Figure 1-5,
informing you that it has successfully connected.
6. Click Quit. 
Safari displays your home page on the Internet.
When connecting through a wireless Internet connection, your Mac essen-
tially broadcasts any information you type (such as credit card numbers or
passwords) through the airwaves. When connected through any wireless
connection, assume that a stranger is peeking at your data. Then only type
in data that you’re comfortable giving away to others.
Dial-up access
Dial-up access involves using a telephone and a telephone modem, which
lets you connect to an ISP and the Internet. Because telephone lines were
designed for voice communication, they’re terribly slow at transferring com-
puter data. As a result, dial-up access is fast becoming obsolete.

Setting Up an Internet Connection

A modem is a device that helps computers connect to the Internet. If your
Internet connection uses cable, you need a cable modem. If your Internet con-
nection uses DSL or a telephone line, you need a DSL modem or a telephone
modem. Modems work only with specific types of Internet connections, so you
can’t substitute a telephone modem for a cable modem and expect it to work.
In many rural areas, dial-up access might be the only option for connecting
to the Internet, because telephone and cable companies might not offer high-
speed Internet service to isolated areas of the country. 
To use dial-up access, you need a modem, which plugs into an ordinary tele-
phone line. Newer Mac computers don’t come with a modem, which means
you’ll have to buy an external modem from Apple (www.apple.com) or
another company. If you have an older Mac, you might have a built-in modem.
Just peek around your computer case and look for a plug for a telephone
jack, which looks almost identical to an Ethernet port only slightly smaller. 
Dial-up access is the slowest way to connect to the Internet. If you have a
choice, use an Ethernet or wireless connection instead, because you’ll be
able to view Web sites much faster. Dial-up access will work, but it’s like
riding a tricycle down a freeway: You’ll eventually get to your destination,
but it will take a long time.
Configuring your dial-up modem
To connect to the Internet through a telephone line, you need to know the
following:
✦The telephone number of your ISP
Figure 1-5:
A message
informs you
when
you’ve
successfully
connected
to a
wireless
network.

Book III
Chapter 1
Browsing the
Internet
Setting Up an Internet Connection
263
✦Your account name given to you by your ISP
✦Your password to your account
The telephone number connects you to the ISP’s computers, but you can’t
get access to the Internet unless you also have a valid account and pass-
word. After the ISP computer verifies that you A) have a valid account and
B) know the right password, you can access the Internet.
To configure your Mac to use your telephone line to connect to the Internet,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Network icon under the Internet & Network category. 
The Network window appears.
3. Click the Modem icon in the left pane. 
The Modem window appears and displays text boxes for entering your
account name, password, and the telephone number to connect to your
ISP’s computer.
4. Click Apply.
5. Click the Close button of the Network window.
Using a modem
After you configure your dial-up access, you have to use the Internet
Connect program to physically dial and connect to the Internet. To use the
Internet Connect program, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Click Applications in the Finder Sidebar.
The content of the Applications folder appears in the right pane of the
Finder.
3. Double-click the Internet Connect icon. 
A dialog appears, displaying the account name and telephone number
that you defined earlier. (If you didn’t define an account name and tele-
phone number, you can enter them now.)
4. Click the Connect button. 
After you’ve connected, you can load your browser and e-mail program
to start using the Internet.

Browsing through Web Sites
264
Browsing through Web Sites
After you connect to the Internet (through a dial-up, Ethernet, or wireless
connection), you still need to run a Web browser. The most popular browser
on the Mac is called Safari, and it comes free with every Mac. However, if 
you don’t like Safari, you can always try another browser such as Firefox
(www.mozilla.com) or Camino (www.caminobrowser.org). 
Defining a home page
Every time you load your browser, it automatically loads a home page, which
is the first Web page that you’ll always see. (The default home page in Safari
is the Apple Web site.)
Throughout this chapter, all step-by-step instructions are given for Safari.
Just keep in mind that other browsers (Firefox, Camino, and so on) work in
similar ways.
To define a home page in Safari (if you don’t like the default home page of
www.apple.com), follow these steps:
1. In Safari, choose Safari➪Preferences. 
A Preferences window appears.
2. Click the General icon. 
The General pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6:
The General
pane lets
you type 
a new
address for

3. Click in the Home Page text box and type a Web site address, such as
www.yahoo.com.
If you click the Set to Current Page button, you can make the currently
displayed Web page your new home page without having to type the
Web page’s address. To use this feature, visit your favorite Web site
immediately after Step 1. Then when you click the Set to Current Page
button, you change your home page to the displayed Web page.
4. Click the Close button of the Preferences window.
Visiting a Web site
Although the first Web site you’ll see will always be your home page, you
probably don’t want to stare at your home page all the time. To visit another
Web site, you’ll use the Web site’s address.
Most Web site addresses consist of several parts, such as “http://www.
yahoo.com”:
✦http://www: Identifies the address as part of the World Wide Web that
uses the HyperText Transfer Protocol (http). 
Some Web sites omit the www portion of the name. Other Web sites use
something unusual like www2. Just keep in mind that www is common, but
not always necessary for a Web site address.
✦The domain name of the Web site (yahoo): Most Web site names are
abbreviations or smashed together names of the Web site, such as
whitehouse for the White House’s Web site.
✦A three-letter identifying extension such as .com: The extension identi-
fies the type of Web site, as shown in Table 1-2.

Many Web sites in other countries end with a two-letter country address,
such as .uk for the United Kingdom, .ca for Canada, and .fr for France. 
When visiting different Web pages on a site, you might see additional text
that identifies a specific Web page, such as www.yahoo.com/sports or
www.yahoo.com/movies. 
To visit a Web site by typing its Web site address, follow these steps:
1. Load the Safari program. 
The Safari window appears, displaying your current home page.
2. Click in the address bar, as shown in Figure 1-7.
3. Type an address (such as www.apple.com) and press Return. 
Safari displays the Web site corresponding to the address you typed.
If you type a Web site address and see an error message, it might mean one
of a few things: You typed the Web site address wrong, your Internet connec-
tion isn’t working, or the Web site is temporarily (or permanently) down.

Searching for Web sites
Typing a Web site address can get tedious. One way to find a Web site is to
use a search engine, which is a special Web site that can look for other Web
sites based on a word or phrase you type in. Because search engines are so
convenient, Safari (and most other browsers) offers a built-in search engine
text box in its upper-right corner. By typing a word or phrase that describes
the kind of Web site you want, the search engine can find a list of related
Web sites so you can click the one you want.
Safari uses the Google search engine. Other browsers, such as Firefox, might
let you choose a different search engine to use.
To search for a Web site, follow these steps:
1. Load the Safari program. 
The Safari window appears, displaying your current home page.
2. Click in the Search text box, type a word or phrase, and press Return. 
The Safari window displays a Web page from Google, which lists Web
sites related to the word or phrase you typed.
3. Click the Web site you want to visit.
If you mistype a word or phrase, the search engine might offer suggestions
for the correct spelling at the same time it looks for Web sites that contain
that misspelled word or phrase, which probably won’t be the Web site you
really want to see.
Every time you type a word or phrase in the Search text box, Safari (and most
other browsers) saves the last ten words or phrases you searched. If you
want to search for that same word or phrase later, just click the downward-
pointing arrow that appears in the left side of the Search text box to display
a menu. Then click the word or phrase you want to search for again.
Searching previously viewed Web sites
If you visit a Web site and find it interesting, you’ll probably want to visit it
again at a later time. Fortunately, Safari stores a list of your previously vis-
ited Web sites in its History menu for up to one year. 
The default setting is to save visited Web sites for one month, but you can
change this by choosing Safari➪Preferences, clicking the General button,
and then clicking the Remove history items pop-up menu to choose a time
limit.

Browsing through Web Sites
268
To view a list of the last Web sites you’ve visited, follow these steps:
1. In Safari, choose History from the main menu. 
A pull-down menu appears, displaying all the Web sites you’ve visited
today. In addition, the History menu lists the past week’s dates so 
you can view Web sites that you visited several days ago, as shown in
Figure 1-8.
2. Choose a Web site. 
Safari displays your chosen site.
You can define how long Safari stores your previously visited Web sites by
following these steps:
1. In Safari, choose Safari➪Preferences. 
A Preferences window appears.
2. Click the General icon. 
The General pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.
3. Click in the Remove History Items pop-up menu and choose an option
such as After One Month or After One Day. 
You might want to choose a shorter time period just in case you 
don’t want other people to see which Web sites you’ve recently visited
in the past, such as something really personal. Or choose History➪
Clear History.
4. Click the Close button of the General window.
Although the History menu only displays the past seven days, you can
choose History➪Show All History to view a list of all the Web sites you’ve
visited in the time period specified by the Remove History Items pop-up
menu in the General window.
Using bookmarks
Bookmarks let you store and organize your favorite Web sites into groups
such as news sites, movie sites, or stock market sites. By organizing your
favorite Web sites into groups, you can quickly find them again.
You can save and view bookmarks in two places as shown in Figure 1-10:
✦The Bookmarks menu
✦The Bookmarks bar

Storing bookmarks on the Bookmarks menu tucks them out of sight. The
drawback is that you must click the Bookmarks menu to find your bookmarks.
Storing bookmarks on the Bookmarks bar keeps the first few entries of your
bookmarks visible and within easy access at all times. The drawback is that
the Bookmarks bar at first can display only a limited number of bookmarks.
(You have to click the arrow nest to Bookmarks Bar to see all entries.)
As a general rule, use the Bookmarks bar for one-click access to your
favorite Web sites and use the Bookmarks menu to store Web sites that you
don’t access as often.
Bookmarks behave the same whether they appear on the Bookmarks menu
or the Bookmarks bar.
Adding bookmarks
To bookmark a Web site address in either the menu or the bar, follow these
steps:
1. In Safari, visit a Web site that you want to store as a bookmark.
2. Choose Bookmark➪Add Bookmark (or click the plus sign button that
appears to the left of the address box). 
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-11.
3. Click in the Name text box and edit or type a descriptive name for
your bookmark. 
By default, the Name text box displays the current Web page’s title, as
defined by the Web page designer.

You can choose the Bookmarks bar, Bookmarks menu, or a specific
folder buried inside the Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (You dis-
cover how to create bookmark folders later, in the “Storing bookmarks in
folder” section of this chapter.)
5. Click Add. 
Deleting bookmarks
After you start saving bookmarks of your favorite Web sites, you might find
that you have too many bookmarks that you don’t use any more. To delete a
bookmark, follow these steps:
1. In Safari, choose Bookmarks➪Show All Bookmarks. 
Safari displays a window divided into two panes. The left pane displays a
list of bookmark folders. (The Bookmarks bar and Bookmarks menu are
considered folders.) The right pane displays the contents of the cur-
rently selected bookmark folder, as shown in Figure 1-12. 
2. Click on the folder, in the left pane, that contains the bookmark you
want to delete. 
The right pane displays the contents of your chosen bookmark folder,
which might include bookmarks and additional folders that contain
other bookmarks.
3. (Optional) Click the triangle that appears to the left of any folder that
appears in the right pane. 
This displays the bookmarks stored in that particular folder. (You might
need to repeat this step several times to find the bookmark you want.)
4. Click to select the bookmark you want to delete.

5. Choose Edit➪Delete. 
Your chosen bookmark disappears. 
You can also right-click a bookmark and, when a pop-up menu appears,
choose Delete.
6. Choose Bookmarks➪Hide All Bookmarks. 
Moving bookmarks
Your browser saves your bookmarks in the order you created them.
However, this most likely isn’t the order that you might want them in. To
rearrange your bookmarks and put them in a more logical order, you can
move a bookmark by following these steps:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Show All Bookmarks. 
Safari displays a window divided into two panes. The left pane displays a
list of bookmark folders. (The Bookmarks bar and Bookmarks menu are
considered folders.) The right pane displays the contents of the cur-
rently selected bookmark folder. 
2. Click the folder, in the left pane, that contains the bookmark you want
to move. 
The right pane displays the contents of your chosen bookmark folder.

3. (Optional) Click the triangle that appears to the left of any folder that
appears in the right pane. 
This step displays the bookmarks stored in that particular folder. 
(You might need to repeat this step several times to find the bookmark
you want.)
4. Click and drag the bookmark you want to move onto a folder in the
left or right pane.
5. Release the mouse button. 
Safari moves your chosen bookmark to its new location.
6. Choose Bookmarks➪Hide All Bookmarks. 
Storing bookmarks in folders
After you save a lot of bookmarks, you’ll find that they might start cluttering
up the Bookmarks menu or Bookmarks bar. To organize your bookmarks,
you can store related bookmarks in folders. To create a bookmark folder,
follow these steps:
1. In Safari, choose Bookmarks➪Show All Bookmarks. 
Safari displays a window divided into two panes. The left pane displays a
list of bookmark folders. (The Bookmarks bar and Bookmarks menu are
considered folders.) The right pane displays the contents of the cur-
rently selected bookmark folder. 
2. Click Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu in the left pane to choose a
location to store your folder.
3. (Optional) Click the triangle that appears to the left of a folder that
appears in the right pane.
Clicking a triangle displays the contents of the folder. 
4. Click any bookmark or bookmark folder in the right pane.
When you create a bookmark folder, it appears inside the same folder
that holds the bookmark or folder you clicked on in this step. 
5. Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder. 
An untitled bookmark folder appears.
6. Type a descriptive name for your bookmark folder onto the newly cre-
ated folder. 
Your cursor is automatically put in place to label the new folder.
7. Choose Bookmarks➪Hide All Bookmarks.

Browsing through Web Sites
274
After you’ve created a bookmark folder, you can copy or move existing book-
marks into that folder.
Using bookmarks
If you’ve saved bookmarks on both the Bookmarks menu and Bookmarks
bar, you can choose bookmarks from either one. To choose a bookmark on
the Bookmarks menu, follow these steps: 
1. In Safari, click the Bookmarks menu. 
A list of bookmarks and folders appears.
2. Do either of the following:
• Click a bookmark in the Bookmarks menu to view your chosen 
Web page.
• Click a bookmark folder in the Bookmarks menu to view a submenu
of additional bookmarks or folders. Then click the bookmark you
want to view.
By default, Safari comes with several bookmarks already placed on the
Bookmarks bar. To choose a bookmark on the Bookmarks bar, do either of
the following:
✦Click a bookmark in the Bookmarks bar to view your chosen Web page.
✦Click a bookmark folder in the Bookmarks bar to view a pull-down menu
of additional bookmarks or folders, as shown in Figure 1-13. Then click
the bookmark you want to view.
Importing and exporting bookmarks
After you’ve collected and organized bookmarks, you might become depend-
ent on your bookmarks to help you navigate the Internet. Fortunately, if you

ever want to switch browsers, you can export bookmarks from one browser
and import them into another browser.
To export bookmarks from Safari, for example, follow these steps: 
1. In Safari, choose File➪Export Bookmarks. 
A dialog appears, asking you to name your exported bookmarks and
choose a folder to store them, as shown in Figure 1-14.
2. Click in the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your
bookmarks. 
3. Choose a folder from the Where pop-up menu to store your bookmarks.
If you click the Arrow button that appears to the right of the Save As text
box, a window appears displaying all the drives and folders you can
choose to store your bookmarks.
4. Click Save.
After you’ve exported bookmarks from one browser, it’s usually a snap to
import them into a second browser. To import bookmarks into Safari, follow
these steps: 
1. In Safari, choose File➪Import Bookmarks. 
An Import Bookmarks dialog appears, giving you the chance to choose a
volume and folder that contains the bookmarks exported by the other
browser, as shown in Figure 1-15.
Figure 1-14:

2. Click the bookmark file you want to use and click the Import button. 
Your imported bookmarks appear in an Imported folder that includes
the date you imported the folder. At this point, you need to move this
folder or its contents on the Bookmarks bar or menu to organize them.
Browsing with SnapBack 
As you browse the Internet, you’ll create a trail of Web pages that you once
viewed. To help you navigate back and forth between the web pages you’ve
viewed, browsers like Safari include a Back and Forward button. 
After you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, you’ll be able to use the
Forward button. The Forward button simply reverses the action of the Back
button and displays the Web page you viewed before clicking Back. If you
click the Forward button enough times, you’ll wind up at the last Web page
you visited. The Back and Forward buttons typically appear as arrows point-
ing in opposite directions, as shown in Figure 1-16.

As an alternative to clicking the Back button multiple times, Safari offers a spe-
cial SnapBack feature. Unlike the Back button, which displays the previous Web
page you viewed, SnapBack lets you jump back to any Web page designated as a
SnapBack anchor point. There are four ways to create a SnapBack anchor point:
✦Click a bookmark.
✦Click a link in an e-mail message.
✦Manually type a Web address (such as www.google.com) into the
address bar. 
✦Choose History➪Mark Page for SnapBack.
So, if you type an address (such as www.aol.com) and then click different
links, clicking the Back button would return you to each previous Web page
in the order that you left them, but clicking the SnapBack icon would imme-
diately jump you to the www.aol.com Web page.
You can have only one Web page designated as a SnapBack anchor point at a
time. The moment you create another SnapBack anchor point, Safari “for-
gets” the previous one.
After you’ve marked a page as a SnapBack anchor point, you can jump back
to that Web page by doing one of the following:
✦Click the SnapBack button that appears as an orange icon in the right of
the address bar. 
✦Choose History➪Page SnapBack
Using tabbed browsing
One problem with browsing different Web sites is that you might want to keep a
piece of one site visible while browsing a second site. Although you could open
two separate browser windows, Safari and most other browsers offer a quick
fix referred to as tabbed browsing. Essentially, tabbed browsing lets you easily
jump back and forth between multiple Web pages in a single window — all you
have to do is click the tab associated with the Web page. (See Figure 1-17.)
Creating additional tabs
When you load Safari, you see a single Web page (the home page) displayed.
To create a tab, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Tab (or press Ô+T). 
An untitled tab appears. 

Browsing through Web Sites
278
2. Type a Web site address or click a bookmark. 
Safari displays your chosen Web page in your new tab.
Turning tabs into separate windows (and vice versa)
After you’ve created a tab and displayed a Web page inside that tab, you can
“tear” that tab off to display it in a separate Safari window instead. To “tear”
off a tab and turn it into a window, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor over the tab you want to convert into a separate
window.
2. Click and drag the tab off the tab row.
The tab turns into a thumbnail image of the Web page displayed in 
that tab.
3. Release the mouse button. 
Safari turns your tab into a separate window.

Another way to turn a tab into a separate window is to follow these steps:
1. Click the tab that you want to turn into a separate window.
2. Choose Window➪Move Tab to New Window or right-click a tab and
choose Move Tab to New Window.
To merge all Safari windows into separate tabs on a single window, choose
Window➪Merge All Windows. 
Deleting a tab
After you create a tab, you’ll eventually want to get rid of that tab to avoid
cluttering up your Safari window. To delete a tab, click the Close icon that
appears in the left corner of each tab.
Using Web Clips
Rather than view an entire Web page, you might really care about only a cer-
tain part of a Web page that’s frequently updated, such as sport scores, traf-
fic congestion on local highways, or headline news. In case you want to view
only part of a Web page, Safari lets you copy part of a Web page and store it
as a Dashboard widget called a Web Clip.
Dashboard widgets are programs that perform a single task and pop up
whenever you press F12. You find out more about Dashboard widgets in
Book VI, Chapter 4.
When you store part of a Web page as a Web Clip, you can view that Web
Clip in one of two ways:
✦Click the Dashboard icon in the Dock.
✦Press F12.
Creating a Web Clip
To create a Web Clip, follow these steps:
1. In Safari, find the Web page you’re interested in.
Usually that would mean a Web page that has a section that gets 
regularly updated — sports scores, traffic reports, election results,
whatever.

2. Click the Web Clip icon (which looks like scissors cutting around a
dotted rectangle) or Choose File➪Open in Dashboard. 
The Web page darkens and highlights a portion of the currently dis-
played Web page, as shown in Figure 1-18.
3. Move the cursor over the part of the Web page that you want to view
as a Dashboard widget. 
4. Click the mouse button. 
Handles appear around your chosen area.
5. Move the cursor over a handle, then click and drag the mouse to
change the size of the area you’ve selected on the Web page.
6. Click Add. 
Your Web Clip gets added to Dashboard although you won’t see anything
until you choose the next step.
7. Click the Dashboard icon on the Dock or press F12. 
Dashboard displays your chosen part of the Web page in a widget, as
shown in Figure 1-19.

Deleting a Web Clip
After you’ve created a Web Clip, you might want to delete it later. To delete a
Web Clip, follow these steps:
1. Click the Dashboard icon in the Dock or press F12. 
All your Dashboard widgets appear.
2. Hold down the Option key and move the pointer over the widget you
want to delete. 
A close icon appears in the upper-left corner.
3. Click in the Close button of the Web Clip widget.
Search for Text on a Web Page
One quick way to skim a Web page is to search for specific words or phrases
of what you want. So if you’re visiting a Web site about investing, you might
want to read about stocks and skip over anything related to real estate. To
search for specific text, you can use Safari’s Find feature.
The Find feature not only finds multiple instances of a word or phrase, but
also highlights them on the Web page to make them easier to see and find.
To search for text on a Web page, follow these steps:

Search for Text on a Web Page
282
1. In Safari, find a Web page that you want to search.
2. Choose Edit➪Find➪Find (or press Ô+F). 
A Find banner (with text box) appears at the top of the Web page.
3. Click in the Find text box and type a word. 
The Find banner lists how many matches it found in the currently 
displayed Web page. Safari highlights the first match, as shown in 
Figure 1-20.
4. Click the Next (or Previous) button to view the next (or previous)
instance of the searched term.
If Safari can’t find another match, it simply starts highlighting the previ-
ous words or phrases.
5. Click the Done button in the Find banner when you’re done searching
through text.

Saving Web Pages

Saving Web Pages
If you find an interesting Web page, you might want to save and share it with
others. Some different ways to save and share a Web page include
✦Saving a Web page as a file
✦Printing a Web page
✦Sending a Web page by e-mail
✦Sending a Web page link by e-mail
The next few sections spell out each of these methods.
Saving a Web page as a file
When you save a Web page as a file, you physically store the complete text
and graphics of that Web page on your Mac. Safari gives you two ways to
save a Web page:
✦As a Web archive
✦As an HTML source file (called Page Source)
A Web archive is meant for viewing a Web page only in the Safari browser.
Saving a Web page as an HTML source file lets you view and edit that file in
any browser or Web page authoring program — which is neat if you want to
figure out how someone designed that particular Web page. 
If you view a Web page saved as Page Source, you might not see all the
graphics properly without a live Internet connection.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is a special language
used to design the layout of all Web pages. 
To save a Web page as a file, follow these steps:
1. in Safari, find the Web page that you want to save.
2. Choose File➪Save As. 
An Export As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-21.
3. Click in the Export As text box and type a descriptive name for 
your file.

Saving Web Pages
284
4. Click in the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to store 
your file. 
If you click the Expand button, the Save As dialog expands to let you
choose more folders to store your file.
5. Click in the Format pop-up menu and choose Web Archive or Page
Source
6. Click Save.
After you save a file as a Web Archive or a Page Source, you can view that file
again by following these steps:
1. In Safari, choose File➪Open File. 
An Open dialog appears.
2. Click the Web Archive or Page Source file you want to view and 
click Open. 
You might need to navigate through different drives and folders to find
the file you want to open.
Only Safari can view a Web Archive file, but any browser can view a Page
Source file.
Printing a Web page as a file
Rather than save a Web page as a file, you might just want to print it instead.
To print a Web page, follow these steps:
1. In Safari, find the Web page you want to print. 
2. Choose File➪Print. 
A Print dialog appears.

The Export
As dialog
lets you

3. Click in the Printer pop-up menu and choose the printer to use.
If you click the PDF button, you can save your Web page as a PDF file. If
you click the Downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Printer pop-up
menu, the Print dialog expands to let you select which pages to print. 
4. Click Print. 
Sending a Web page by e-mail
After saving a Web page as a separate file, you can then attach that file to an
e-mail message to send it to a friend. This might be what you want to do if
you want to send the same Web page to multiple people, but if you just want
to send a Web page to just one person, you don’t really have to save it as a
file and then attach it to an e-mail message. You can just send a Web page as
part of your e-mail message itself, as shown in Figure 1-22.
If you use a different e-mail program with Safari, you may not be able to send
a Web page as an e-mail message.
To send a Web page as an e-mail message, follow these steps:
1. In Safari, find the Web page that you want to send.

2. Choose File➪Mail Contents of This Page. 
The Mail program loads and displays your Web page in the message 
text box. 
3. Click in the To text box and type an e-mail address.
4. Click Send. 
Sending a Web page as a link
As an alternative to sending a Web page, you can just send a link to a Web
page as part of your e-mail message. The main advantage of sending a link 
is that it doesn’t take as much space as sending the actual Web page. To
include a link in an e-mail message, follow these steps:
1. In Safari, find the Web page that you want to share with others.
2. Choose File➪Mail Link to This Page. 
Your e-mail program loads and displays the Web address of the currently
displayed Web page in Safari.
3. Click in the To text box and type an e-mail address.
Click Send.
If you send a link to a Web page and that Web page or Web site gets changed
or gets taken offline, anyone who clicks the link will see an error message
and then might wonder why you sent a dead link. 
Viewing and Playing Multimedia Files
The simplest Web pages consist of nothing but text and graphics. However,
many Web sites offer content stored as video, audio, and PDF (Portable
Document Format) files. Although your Mac includes many programs for
viewing and listening to video, audio, and PDF files, you might still need
additional software to view some Web sites. 
Watching video
Many news sites offer videos that require Windows Media Player or
RealPlayer. Figure 1-23 shows a typical message a Web site might 
display if you don’t have the proper video player program installed on 
your Mac.

To download the Windows Media Player, visit Microsoft’s Web site (www.
microsoft.com). Microsoft actually gives you two choices. First, you can
download the Windows Media Player for the Mac. However, Microsoft has
stopped developing this program, so as a second choice, Microsoft offers a
free program called Flip4Mac.
Some Web sites won’t work unless you’re using Microsoft Windows. In this
case, you might need to run Windows on your Mac using one of the pro-
grams described in Book V, Chapter 4.
The Flip4Mac program basically allows the QuickTime player (which comes
free with every Mac) to play video files designed to run only with the Windows
Media Player. Given the choice between downloading the Windows Media
Player for the Mac (which will no longer be updated and improved) or the
Flip4Mac program (which will get updated and improved), you might as well
download Flip4Mac.
Besides downloading and installing the Flip4Mac program, you should also
download and install the RealPlayer program (www.real.com). After you
have both Flip4Mac and RealPlayer installed, you should be able to watch
most videos on every Web site you visit.

Downloading Files

Listening to streaming audio
Many Web sites offer audio that you can hear, such as live interviews or
radio shows. Such audio is often stored as streaming audio, which means as
your computer downloads the audio file, it plays it right away without actu-
ally saving the file to your hard drive. 
Sometimes you can listen to streaming audio through the iTunes program,
sometimes you need a copy of Windows Media Player (or Flip4Mac), and some-
times you need a copy of RealPlayer. 
Even worse, some Web sites won’t let you listen to streaming audio unless
you use a special program that runs only on the Windows operating system,
such as SHOUTcast (www.shoutcast.com). In these cases, you simply can’t
listen to streaming audio from that particular Web site using your Mac.
The only way to run a Windows streaming audio program is to run that pro-
gram on a copy of Windows on your Mac, using either the Boot Camp pro-
gram or a virtualization program like Parallels (www.parallels.com) or
Fusion (www.vmware.com). (See Book V, Chapter 4 for more information
about running Windows on a Mac.) 
Viewing PDF files
Some Web sites offer information stored in PDF (Portable Document Format)
files, which is a special file format for storing the layout of text and graphics
that appears identically on different computers. If a Web site offers a PDF
file, you can view and scroll through it directly within Safari.
After you view a PDF file in Safari, you can save that file by choosing
File➪Save As. If you double-click a PDF file icon, you can view the contents
of that PDF file by using the Preview program included with every Mac. 
You can view PDF files by using the Acrobat Reader program — a free down-
load from Adobe (www.adobe.com) — but Acrobat Reader essentially dupli-
cates the features of the Preview program that comes with every Mac. If you
have problems printing certain PDF files in the Preview program, you might
want to print them through the Acrobat Reader program instead.
Downloading Files
Part of the Internet’s appeal is that you can find interesting files — music
files or program files, for example — that you can download and/or install on
your own computer. (When you copy a file off another computer and store it
on your computer, that’s called downloading. When you copy a file off your
computer and store it on another computer, that’s called uploading.)

Downloading Files
289
Many software publishers offer free or trial versions of programs that you
can download just by clicking on a button or link that says Download. After
you download a file, you can copy or run it later.
Never download a file unless you trust the source. If you visit an unknown
Web site, that unknown Web site might be trying to trick you into download-
ing a file that could delete files, mess up your computer, or even spy on your
activities or bombard you with unwanted ads, so be careful. 
Downloading a file
To start downloading a file, you must first find a link or button on a Web 
site that will start sending a file from another computer to your own Mac.
With those preliminaries out of the way, do the following to actually down-
load a file:
1. In Safari, find a Web site that offers a file you can download. 
2. Click this link or button to start downloading a file. 
The Downloads window appears, showing the name of the file you’re
downloading and approximately how much time is remaining in the
download, as shown in Figure 1-24.
3. Wait until your file is completely downloaded and then double-click
that file to open it. 
If you downloaded a program, that program might start running or
installing itself on your Mac, so follow the on-screen instructions.
If you click the Magnifying glass icon to the right of a file displayed in the
Download window, you can view that file inside the Finder.

The Downloads window keeps track of every file you download. If you don’t
want others to see what you’ve been downloading, follow these steps to
clear this Download window:
1. In Safari, choose Window➪Downloads. 
The Downloads window appears.
2. Click Clear in the bottom left corner of the Downloads window. 
The Downloads window clears itself.

Chapter 2: Sending and 
Receiving E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Configuring an e-mail account
 Writing e-mail
 Receiving and reading e-mail
 Organizing e-mail
S
ending and receiving e-mail is one of the most popular uses for the
Internet. E-mail is fast, (almost always) free, and accessible to anyone
with a computer and an Internet connection. 
To send and receive e-mail, you first have to set up an e-mail account. The
three types of e-mail accounts you can set up are called POP (Post Office
Protocol), IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), and Exchange. 
A POP e-mail account usually transfers (moves) e-mail from the POP server
computer to your computer. An IMAP or Exchange e-mail account stores
e-mail on its server, which allows multiple individuals to access the same
e-mail account simultaneously. Most individuals have POP accounts,
whereas many corporations have IMAP or Exchange accounts. 
Setting Up an E-Mail Account
When you have an e-mail account, you’ll often have two choices for reading
and writing messages:
✦Through a browser such as Safari
✦Through an e-mail program such as the Mac’s free program called Mail
You don’t have to choose between the methods — you can use both.
Accessing an e-mail account through a browser is simple because you don’t
need to know how to use another program, and you don’t have to worry
about knowing the technical details of your e-mail account. The drawback is
that you need Internet access every time you want to read or respond to
messages.

Setting Up an E-Mail Account
292
Accessing an e-mail account through an e-mail program lets you download
messages so you can read or respond to them even if you aren’t connected
to the Internet. (Of course, you won’t be able to send or receive any messages
until you connect to the Internet again.) The drawback of using an e-mail
program is that you must configure it to work with your e-mail account.
There are dozens of e-mail programs you can use, but the most popular one
is the free Mail program that comes with every Mac. If you don’t like Mail,
you can download and install a free e-mail program such as Thunderbird
(www.mozilla.com), or buy an e-mail program such as Microsoft Entourage
(www.microsoft.com) or MailSmith (www.barebones.com). 
If you plan to access your e-mail account only through a browser like Safari,
you can skip this entire chapter because this chapter explains how to use
the Mail program.
Gathering your e-mail account information
To make an e-mail program work with your e-mail account, you need to
gather the following information:
✦Your username (also called an account name): Typically a descriptive
name (such as jerrysmith), a collection of numbers or symbols (such as
7300914 or 1m3990-4), or both (jerrysmith77). Your username plus the
name of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) defines your complete
e-mail address, such as jerrysmith77@aol.com.
✦Your password: Any phrase that you choose to access your account. If
someone sets up an e-mail account for you, he or she might have already
assigned a password that you can always change later.
✦Your e-mail account’s incoming server name: The name of the com-
puter that contains your e-mail messages. If you’re using a POP account,
the incoming server name is usually a combination of POP or the word
“mail” and your e-mail account company, such as pop.acme.com or
mail.acme.com.
✦Your e-mail account’s outgoing server name: The name of the computer
that will send your messages to other people. The outgoing server name
is usually a combination of SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and
the name of the company that provides your e-mail account, such as
smtp.acme.com.
If you don’t know your account name, password, incoming server name, or
outgoing server name, ask the company that runs your e-mail account.
Without all this information, you won’t be able to receive or send e-mail mes-
sages through a separate e-mail program.

Configuring your e-mail account 
After you’ve collected the technical information needed to access your
e-mail account, you need to configure the Mail program to work with your
e-mail account by following these steps:
1. Click the Mail icon in the Dock. 
A New Account dialog appears, welcoming you to Mail. 
2. Click Continue. 
Another New Account dialog appears, asking for your name and pass-
word, as shown in Figure 2-1.
3. Enter your full name, e-mail address, and password in the text boxes. 
Your full name is any name you want to associate with your messages. If
you type “Zambar the Great” in the Full Name text box, all your mes-
sages will include “From: Zambar the Great.” Your e-mail address
includes your username plus ISP name such as billy394@earthlink.net.
Your password might be case-sensitive, so type it exactly.
4. (Optional) Select (or deselect) the Automatically Setup Account 
check box. 
The Automatically Setup Account check box and the Create button
appear after you’ve typed in your full name, e-mail address, and pass-
word. When the check box is selected, Mail will attempt to connect and

configure itself automatically after you click the Create button. If this
attempt fails, you’ll have to manually configure the Mail program.
5. Click Continue. 
An Incoming Mail Server dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-2.
6. Choose your incoming mail server type from the Account Type 
pop-up menu.
Your choices here are .Mac, POP, IMAP, or Exchange. 
You would choose the .Mac account type only if you subscribe to the
.Mac service. 
7. (Optional) Click in the Description text box and type a description of
your account. 
This description is for your benefit only, so feel free to type anything 
you want. Because you can configure Mail to access two or more e-mail
accounts, you might want to identify an account as a Work account or a
Yahoo! account. 
8. Click in the Incoming Mail Server text box and type the name of your
server. 
If you don’t know this name, you’ll have to ask your ISP or e-mail
account provider.
9. Click in the User Name text box and type your username.
10. Click in the Password text box and type your password. 
Your password appears on-screen as a series of dots to keep people
from peeking over your shoulder and seeing your password.

Writing E-Mails
After you’ve configured Mail, you can start writing and sending e-mail to
anyone all over the world (just as long as you have their e-mail address, that
is). There are three ways to write and send an e-mail:
✦Create a new message from scratch.
✦Reply to a message you received from someone else.
✦Forward a message you received from someone else.
Creating a new e-mail
When you’re writing a message to someone for the first time, you have to
create a new message by following these steps:
1. In Mail, choose File➪New Message (or click the New Message button). 
A New Message window appears.
2. Click in the To text box and type an e-mail address.
You can type multiple e-mail addresses in the To text box by separat-
ing each e-mail address with a comma, such as john@yahoo.com,
bill@microsoft.com. 
3. Click in the Subject text box and type a brief description of your mes-
sage for your recipient.
4. Click in the Message text box and type your message.
5. Click the Send button.

Replying to a message
You’ll often respond to a message that somebody else sent to you. When you
reply to a message, your reply can contain the text that you originally
received so the recipient can better understand the context of your reply.
To reply to a message, you need to receive a message first. To receive mes-
sages, just click the Get Mail button. You find out more about receiving mes-
sages later in this chapter. 
To reply to a message, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon under the Mailboxes category in the left
pane of the Mail window. 
The right pane lists all the messages currently stored in your Inbox
folder.
2. Click to select a message in the right pane that you want to reply to.
3. Choose Message➪Reply (or click the Reply button).
A Message window appears with the e-mail address of your recipient,
the subject already typed in, and the text of the message so that the
other person can understand the context of your reply.
If you’re replying to a message that was sent to you and several other
people, you can reply to everyone who received the same message by
choosing Message➪Reply All or by clicking the Reply All button.
4. Click in the Message text box and type a message.
5. Click Send.
Forwarding a message
Sometimes you might receive a message and want to send that message to
someone else. When you send a copy of a forwarded message, that message
appears directly in the Message text box, as shown in Figure 2-5. 
To forward a message, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon under the Mailboxes category in the left
pane of the Mail window. 
The right pane lists all the messages stored in your Inbox folder.
2. In the right pane, click to select a message that you want to forward.
3. Click the Forward button at the top of the Mail window.
4. Click in the To text box and type an e-mail address.
5. Click Send.

Writing E-Mails
298
Sending a file attachment
When you send an e-mail, you’re basically sending text. However, sometimes
you might want to send pictures or word processor documents. Anyone
receiving your message and file attachment can then save the file attach-
ment and open it later. Because so many people need to share Microsoft
Word files or digital photographs, file attachments are a popular way to
share files with others.
Your e-mail account may have a maximum file size limit you can send, such
as 10MB. (If too many people send large file attachments, it could slow down
e-mail access for other customers.) If you have a file larger than the maxi-
mum limit, you might have to send your files through a free, separate file-
delivery service such as YouSendIt (www.yousendit.com), SendThisFile
(www.sendthisfile.com), or BigUpload (www.bigupload.com). 
To attach a file to a message, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, open a Message window as described in one of the preceding
sections. 
You can open a Message window to create a new message, reply to an
existing message, or forward an existing message.

2. Choose File➪Attach File (or click the Attach button). 
A dialog appears.
3. Navigate through the folders to get to the file you want to send and
then click it. 
To select multiple files, hold down the Ô key and click each file you
want to send. To select a range of files, hold down the Shift key and click
on the first and last files you want to send.
4. Click Choose File. 
5. Click Send.
Sending a message to multiple recipients 
If you want to send the same message to several people, you can type multi-
ple e-mail addresses, separated by a comma, in one or more of the following
fields:
✦To
✦Carbon copy (Cc)
✦Blind carbon copy (Bcc)
The To field is meant to hold e-mail addresses of people who you want to
read your message. The Carbon copy (Cc) field is meant to hold e-mail
addresses of people who you want to keep informed, but who don’t neces-
sarily need to write a reply. 
When sending out a particularly important message, many people type the
recipient’s e-mail address in the To field and their own e-mail address in the
Carbon copy field. This way they can verify that their message was sent out
correctly.
When someone receives an e-mail message, he or she can read all the e-mail
addresses stored in the To and Carbon copy fields. If you don’t want anyone
else to know who received your message, use Blind carbon copy. (It’s possi-
ble to use both Carbon copy and Blind carbon copy in the same message.)
Whenever you write a message, the To field is always visible since you need
to send your message to at least one e-mail address. However, Mail can hide
and display both the Carbon copy and Blind carbon copy fields because you
don’t always want or need them to send every message your write.
To send multiple copies of the same message as Carbon copy or Blind
carbon copy, follow these steps:

1. In Mail, open a Message window as described in one of the preceding
sections. 
You can open a Message window to create a new message, reply to an
existing message, or forward an existing message.
2. (Optional) Choose View➪Cc Address Field if the Cc field isn’t cur-
rently visible.

rently visible. 
A check mark means the Bcc text box appears in the Message window.
4. Click in the Cc and/or Bcc text box and type an e-mail address. 
You can type multiple e-mail addresses in the To, Cc, and Bcc text boxes
by separating each e-mail address with a comma, such as
john@yahoo.com, bill@microsoft.com. 
5. Click Send.
Using e-mail stationery
E-mail stationery consists of graphic designs and formatted text that you can
edit. By using stationery, you can create e-mail messages that look more
interesting than plain text.
Picking a stationery design
To use Mail’s Stationery feature to create a new message, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, choose File➪New Message (or click the New Message icon). 
A New Message window appears.
2. Click the Show Stationery button. 
A list of stationery categories (Birthday, Photos, and so on) appears in
the upper-left pane and a list of stationery designs appears in the upper-
middle of the New Message window, as shown in Figure 2-6.
3. Click a Stationery category, such as Sentiments or Birthday. 
Each time you click a different category, the Mail window displays a list
of stationery designs in that category.
4. Click the stationery design that you want to use. 
Your chosen stationery appears in the main section of the New Message
window. 
5. Click any text and edit or type new text.

Modifying photographs in a stationery design
After you’ve chosen a stationery design, you can edit the text and replace it
with your own personal message. If a stationery displays a photograph, you
can replace the photograph with another picture, either one stored in iPhoto
or one stored anywhere else on your hard drive.
To add your own pictures to a stationery design, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the Mail program displays a stationery design that includes
one or more pictures, as shown in top part of Figure 2-7.
2. Do one of the following actions:
• Call up the Finder by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock. (You might
need to move the Finder and Mail windows so they appear side by
side.)
• Click the Photo Browser icon. The Photo Browser window appears,
containing all the photographs you’ve stored in iPhoto.
3. In either the Finder or the Photo Browser, navigate to the folder that
contains a photograph that you want to use in your stationery.

Spell and grammar checking
Although e-mail is considered less formal than other forms of communica-
tion, such as letters or subpoenas, you probably don’t want your e-mail mes-
sage riddled with spelling errors and typos that can make you look like an
uneducated clod. That’s why Mail provides a spell checker along with a
grammar checker.
To use the built-in spell and grammar checker, you need to configure it first
to define whether you want it to check as you type or wait until you’re done
typing. 
Configuring the spell and grammar checker
By default, the Mail program has its spell checker turned on to check mis-
spellings as you type. When Mail finds a misspelled word, it underlines the
word in red. If you find this annoying or want to turn on the grammar
checker too, you need to configure the spell and grammar checker. If you’re
happy with the way the spell checker works, you don’t have to configure the
spell or grammar checker at all. 
To configure the spell and grammar checker, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, choose Mail➪Preferences. 
A Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Composing tab.
The Composing pane of the Preferences window appears.
3. Choose one of the following options from the Check Spelling pop-up
menu, as shown in Figure 2-8:
• As I Type: Underlines possible misspellings and grammar problems
as you write.
• When I Click Send: Spell and grammar checks your message before
it’s sent.
• Never: Doesn’t perform spell or grammar checking.
4. Click the Close button of the Preferences window.
Checking spelling and grammar 
If you have spell checking turned on while you type, the spell checker will
underline suspected misspelled words in red to help you find potential prob-
lems easily. If you want to spell and grammar check your entire message,
follow these steps:

Writing E-Mails

1. Open a Message window as described earlier in this chapter.
You can open a Message window to create a new message, reply to an
existing message, or forward an existing message.
2. Choose Edit➪Spelling and Grammar➪Show Spelling and Grammar.
The spell and grammar check does its thing, with a Spelling and
Grammar dialog appearing each time the Mail program finds a poten-
tially misspelled word, as shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9:

3. Click one of the following buttons:
• Ignore: Tells Mail that the word is correct.
• Learn: Adds the word to the dictionary.
• Find Next: Finds the next occurrence of the same misspelled word.
• Change: Changes the misspelled word with the spelling that you
choose from the list box on the left.
4. Click Send.
The spell and grammar checker can’t catch all possible errors (words like to
and two can slip past because the words are spelled correctly), so make sure
you proofread your message after you finish spell and grammar checking
your message.
Receiving and Reading E-Mail
After you start giving out your e-mail address to other people, you can start
receiving e-mail. To receive e-mail, your e-mail program must contact your
incoming mail server and download the messages to your Mac. Then you
can either check for new mail manually or have the Mail program check for
new mail automatically.
Retrieving e-mail 
To check and retrieve e-mail manually in Mail, choose Mailbox➪Get New
Mail (or click the Get Mail icon). The number of new messages appears next
to the Inbox icon.
Checking for new e-mail manually can get tedious, so you can configure Mail
to check for new mail automatically at fixed intervals of time, such as every
5 or 15 minutes. To configure Mail to check for new messages automatically,
follow these steps:
1. In Mail, choose Mail➪Preferences.
The Preferences window appears.
2. Click the General icon.
The General pane appears, as shown in Figure 2-10.
3. From the Check for New Mail pop-up menu, choose an option to deter-
mine how often to check for new messages.
You can check every minute, every 5 minutes, every 15 minutes, every
30 minutes, or every hour.

Receiving and Reading E-Mail
306
4. (Optional) Choose a sound to play when you receive new messages
from the New Mail Sound pop-up menu.
You can also choose None in case any sound bothers you.
5. Click the Close button of the Preferences window.
Mail can check for new messages only if you leave Mail running. If you quit
Mail, it can’t check for new messages periodically.
Reading e-mail
After you start receiving e-mail, you can start reading your messages. When
you receive a new message, Mail flags it with a dot in the Message Status
column, as shown in Figure 2-11.
To read a message, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
A list of messages stored in the Inbox appears.
2. Do one of the following:
• Click a message and read the message in the Preview pane.
• Double-click a message to display and read a message in a separate
window.
Figure 2-10:
The General
pane lets
you define

The advantage of the Preview pane is that you can scan your messages
quickly by clicking each one without having to open a separate window. The
advantage of reading a message in a separate window is that you can resize
that window and see more of the message without having to scroll as often
as you would if you were reading that same message in the Preview pane. 
Viewing and saving file attachments
When you receive a message that has a file attachment, Mail identifies 
how many attachments there are and displays a Save button, as shown in
Figure 2-12.
To save a file attachment, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
A list of messages stored in the Inbox appears.
2. Click a message. 
If the message has a file attachment, the number of attachments, the
amount of space they take up, the Save button, and the Quick Look
button all appear in the message headers that list who sent the message,
the date sent, and the message subject.

Quick Look window when you’re done looking at its contents.
4. Click the Save button. 
Mail saves your attachments into the Downloads folder stored inside
your Home folder. (You may also access the Downloads folder on the
Dock, to the left of the Trash icon.)
Storing e-mail addresses
Typing an e-mail address every time you want to send a message can get
tedious — if you can even remember the address. Fortunately, Mail lets you
store names and e-mail addresses in the Address Book program. Then you
can just click that person’s name to send a message without typing that
person’s entire e-mail address.
Adding an e-mail address to the Address Book
When you receive an e-mail from someone you like, you can store that
person’s e-mail address in the Address Book by following these steps:
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
A list of messages appears in the right pane.

Although nothing appears to happen, your chosen e-mail address is now
stored in the Address Book. 
To view your list of stored names and e-mail addresses, you can open the
Address Book by choosing Windows➪Address Panel. 
Retrieving an e-mail address from the Address Book
When you create a new message, you can retrieve an e-mail address from
your Address Book. To retrieve an e-mail address, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, choose File➪New Message (or click the New Message icon). 
A New Message window appears.
2. Click the Address button (or choose Windows➪Address Panel). 
An Address Panel appears, as shown in Figure 2-13.
3. Click to select the name of the person you want to send a message to.
4. Click the To button. 
Your chosen e-mail address appears in the To: text box. (If you click on

Deleting a name and e-mail address from the Address Book
After you’ve stored names and e-mail addresses in your Address Book, you
might want to delete some of them one day. To delete an e-mail address in
the Address Book, follow these steps:
1. Click the Address Book icon in the Dock (or double-click the Address
Book icon in the Applications folder). 
The Address Book window appears.
2. Click the name you want to delete.
3. Choose Edit➪Delete Card. 
The Address Book deletes your chosen name.
If you accidentally delete a name, you can retrieve it right away by
choosing Edit➪Undo Delete Record. 
4. Choose Address Book➪Quit Address Book.
Deleting messages
After you read a message, you can either leave it in your Inbox or delete it.
Generally, it’s a good idea to delete messages you won’t need ever again,
such as an invitation to somebody’s birthday party back in July 2005. By
deleting unnecessary messages, you can keep your Inbox organized and
uncluttered.
To delete a message, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
A list of messages stored in the Inbox appears.
2. Click the message you want to delete.
To select multiple messages, hold down the Ô key and click additional
messages. To select a range of messages, hold down the Shift key, click
the first message to delete, and then click the last message to delete,
and release the Shift key.
3. Choose Edit➪Delete (or click the Delete button). 
Deleting a message doesn’t immediately erase it, but stores it in the Trash
folder. If you don’t go and “empty the trash,” you still have the chance to
retrieve deleted messages, as outlined in the next section.
Retrieving messages from the Trash folder
Each time you delete a message, Mail stores the deleted messages in the
Trash folder. If you think you deleted a message by mistake, you can retrieve
it by following these steps:

Book III
Chapter 2

Organizing E-Mail
311
1. In Mail, click the Trash folder. 
A list of deleted messages appears.
2. Click the message you want to retrieve.
3. Choose Message➪Move To➪Inbox.
Emptying the Trash folder
Messages stored in the Trash folder continue to take up space, so you
should periodically empty the Trash folder by following these steps:
1. In Mail, choose Mailbox➪Erase Deleted Messages. 
A submenu appears, listing all the e-mail accounts in Mail.
2. Choose either In All Accounts (to erase all deleted messages) or the
name of a specific e-mail account (to erase messages only from that
particular account).
Organizing E-Mail
To help you manage and organize your e-mail messages, Mail lets you search
and sort your messages. Searching lets you find specific text stored in a par-
ticular message. Sorting lets you arrange your messages in folders so one
folder might contain personal messages and a second folder might contain
business messages. 
Searching through e-mail
To manage your e-mail effectively, you need to be able to search for the one
(or more) message you want. To search through your e-mail for the names of
senders or text in a message Subject line, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click in the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner.
2. Type a word, phrase, or partial phrase that you want to find. 
As you type, Mail displays a list of messages that match the text you’re
typing, as shown in Figure 2-14.
3. Click a message to read it. 
Sorting e-mail
You can sort e-mail in ascending or descending order based on different cat-
egories, such as alphabetically by the sender, chronologically by date sent,
or alphabetically by subject. 

Organizing E-Mail
312
The easiest way to sort your e-mail is by clicking a column heading, such as
From or Subject.
To sort your e-mail, you can also follow these steps:
1. In Mail, choose View➪Sort By. 
A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 2-15.
2. Choose a criteria to sort, such as by Date Sent or Subject. 
Mail then sorts the e-mail according to your whims.

Organizing e-mail with mailbox folders
When you receive e-mail, all of your messages get dumped in the Inbox. After
a while, you might have so many messages stored there that trying to find
related messages can be nearly impossible. 
To fix this problem, you can create separate folders for organizing your dif-
ferent e-mails. After you’ve created a folder, you can group related messages
together so you can quickly find them again later.
The most common type of e-mail to organize is junk e-mail, which you can
route automatically into the Trash. Book III, Chapter 4 explains how to con-
figure Mail to handle junk e-mail.
Creating a mailbox folder
To create a mailbox folder, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox. 
A New Mailbox dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-16.
2. Click in the Name text box and type a descriptive name for your mail-
box folder.
3. Click OK. 
Your mailbox folder appears in the left pane of the Mail window.
Storing messages in a mailbox folder
When you create a mailbox folder, it’s completely empty. To store messages
in a mailbox folder, you must manually drag those messages into the mailbox
folder. Dragging physically moves your message from the Inbox folder into
your mailbox folder.

2. Click to select a message that you want to move to your mailbox
folder.
If you hold down the Ô key while clicking a message, you can select mul-
tiple messages. If you hold down the Shift key, you can click one mes-
sage and then click another message to select those two messages and
every message in between. 
3. Click and drag the selected message onto your mailbox folder.
4. Release the mouse button when the pointer highlights the mailbox
folder. 
Your selected messages now appear in the mailbox folder.
Deleting a mailbox folder
You can delete a mailbox folder by following these steps:
1. In Mail, click on the mailbox folder you want to delete.
2. Choose Mailbox➪Delete. 
A dialog box appears, asking if you really want to delete your folder.
When you delete a mailbox folder, you delete all messages stored inside.
3. Click Delete.
Automatically organizing e-mail 
with smart mailboxes
Mailbox folders can help organize your messages, but you must manually
drag messages into those folders. To make this process automatic, you can
use smart mailboxes instead.
A smart mailbox differs from an ordinary mailbox in two ways: 
✦A smart mailbox lets you define the type of messages you want to store
automatically; that way, Mail sorts your messages without any addi-
tional work from you. 
✦A smart mailbox doesn’t physically contain a message but only a link to
the actual message, which is still stored in the Inbox folder (or any
folder that you move it to). Because smart mailboxes don’t physically
move messages, it’s possible for a single message to have links stored in
multiple smart mailboxes.

Creating a smart mailbox
To create a smart mailbox, you need to define a name for your smart mail-
box along with the criteria for the types of messages to store in your smart
mailbox. To create a smart mailbox, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, choose Mailbox➪New Smart Mailbox. 
A Smart Mailbox dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-17
2. Click in the Smart Mailbox Name text box and type a descriptive name

messages match your defined criteria, you can click your smart mailbox
icon to see a list of messages.
The messages stored in a smart mailbox are just links to the actual messages
stored in your Inbox folder.
Deleting a smart mailbox
Deleting a smart mailbox doesn’t physically delete any messages because a
smart mailbox only contains links to existing messages. To delete a smart
mailbox, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click the smart mailbox folder you want to delete.
2. Choose Mailbox➪Delete. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete your smart
mailbox.
3. Click Delete (or Cancel).

out of the Inbox folder and into another folder automatically, which you can
do by defining rules.
The basic idea behind rules is to pick criteria for selecting messages, such 
as all messages from specific e-mail addresses or subject lines that contain
certain phrases, and route them automatically into a folder.
To create a rule, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences. 
A Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Rules icon. 
The Rules window appears, as shown in Figure 2-20.

Chapter 3: Chatting in Real Time
In This Chapter
 Setting up an account
 Creating a user profile
 Creating a chat
 Finding people to chat with
 Chatting via text, video, and audio
T
he idea behind instant messaging is that you can communicate with
someone over the Internet using text, audio, or even video — and it’s 
all free.
Now you can swap messages with your friends, chat in real time across the
planet, and even see each other through video images as you speak. Instant
messaging offers another way for you to communicate with anyone in the
world using an Internet connection and your Mac.
Although instant messaging can make communicating easy, instant messag-
ing programs in the past have often been clumsy or difficult to use. That’s
why Apple designed iChat. Not only is iChat much easier to use than other
instant messaging programs, but it also integrates video, audio, and text fea-
tures so that anybody can start instant messaging their friends as easily as
chatting over the telephone.
Setting Up an iChat Account
To chat with people on the Internet, you need to set up an account with one
of the following services:
✦.Mac: (Costs $99 a year.) If you create a free trial .Mac account and later
cancel, you can still use your .Mac account name for free with iChat.
✦AOL Instant Messenger (AIM): Available at www.aim.com. (Free.) 
You can also set up accounts with Jabber (www.jabber.org) and Google
Talk (www.google.com/talk), but these accounts aren’t as easy to use
with iChat as .Mac and AIM. If you want to make iChat as easy as possible to
use, get a .Mac or AIM account.

Setting Up an iChat Account
320
After you have an account, you can set up an iChat account by following
these steps:
1. Load iChat by double-clicking on the iChat icon in the Applications
folder. 
A Welcome window appears.
2. Click Continue. 
A second iChat window appears, giving you a chance to enter your .Mac
or AIM account, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. Choose your flavor of chat from the Account Type pop-up menu.
Your choices here include .Mac Account, AIM Account, Jabber Account,
and Google Talk Account.
4. Enter your account username in the Member Name text box.
5. Enter your password in the Password text box.
If you click the Get an iChat Account button, you see Apple’s Web site,
encouraging you to sign up for the .Mac service. 
6. Click Continue.
A third iChat window informs you that you’ve successfully set up an
iChat account.
7. Click Done. 
Figure 3-1:
The iChat
window
asks for
your
account
name.

Book III
Chapter 3
Chatting in 
Real Time
Setting Up an iChat Account
321
Setting up an account is only half the battle. Next you have to contact your
friends to get their iChat account names and to give your iChat account
name to others. (Think of account numbers as telephone numbers; you can’t
call a friend without first knowing her phone number, and similarly, you can’t
chat with someone if you don’t know her account name.)
Storing names in a buddy list
A buddy list lets you store the account names of your friends. To contact a
friend on your buddy list, just click his or her name in your buddy list.
To add a name to your buddy list, follow these steps:
1. Load iChat. 
If you don’t see a Buddy List window, choose Window➪AIM Buddy List.
(The AIM Buddy List lists all your buddy’s addresses from various
instant messaging services.)
2. Choose Buddies➪Add Buddy. 
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
3. Click in the Account Name text box and type your friend’s account name.
4. Click in the Account Name pop-up menu and chose AIM or .Mac,
depending on which service your buddy uses.
iChat is designed to work seamlessly with AIM or .Mac accounts. Google
and Jabber accounts are supported, but they require additional configu-
ration, which is beyond the scope of this book.
5. Click in the Add to Group pop-up menu and choose a group to store
your friend’s name under, such as Buddies or Family. 
You can always change this group later.
Figure 3-2:
To add a
new name,
you must

6. Enter the first and last name of your buddy in the appropriate text
boxes.
Typing your buddy’s first and last name is for your convenience only. If
you don’t know someone’s first or last name, just leave it blank.
7. Click Add. 
Your new buddy appears in your buddy list.
Organizing a buddy list
When you add a name to your buddy list, you have to store it within an exist-
ing group, such as Buddies, Family, or Co-Workers. If you want, you can
always move or copy a name to a different group or even create completely
new groups, such as a group of people involved in a specific project — a
community planning committee, say, or a Little League team, Boy Scout
troop, or family reunion.
Moving a name to another group
The first time you add a name to your buddy list, you might have acciden-
tally put a name in your Family group when you really want the name in the
Friend group. To move a name to another group, follow these steps:
1. Load iChat. 
If you don’t see a Buddy List window, choose Window➪AIM Buddy List.
2. Click a group name in the Buddy List window to reveal all the names
stored within that group.
If you hold down the Option key and then perform Step 3, you can copy
a name to another group.
3. Click and drag a name onto a new group name.
4. Release the mouse button. 
The name now appears in the new group.
Creating a new group
iChat includes a Buddies, Family, and Co-Workers group, but you might want
to create new groups of your own. To create a group, follow these steps:
1. In iChat, click the Add button (plus sign) that appears in the bottom-
left corner of the Buddy List window. 
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.

2. Choose Add Group. 
A dialog appears, asking for a group name.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your group in the Enter Group Name text
box and then click Add. 
Your new group appears in the buddy list. At this point, you have to
copy or move names into your newly created group.
You can always rename a group by right-clicking the group and choosing
Rename Group from the menu that appears. 
Sorting names in a buddy list
To customize the appearance of your buddy list even more, you can sort
names. Sorting lets you arrange names alphabetically by first or last name.
To sort names, follow these steps:
1. In iChat, choose View➪Sort Buddies. 
A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 3-4.

2. Choose one of the following:
• By Availability: Groups all buddies available for chatting.
• By First Name: Sorts names alphabetically by first name.
• By Last Name: Sorts names alphabetically by last name.
• Manually: Lets you drag names to sort them any way you want.
Shortening names in a buddy list
iChat can display names as full names (John Doe), as shortened names
(John), or by nicknames or handles (GeniusMan). For friends, it might be fun
to display names based on handles, but for business use, it’s probably best
to stick with full or shortened names.
To define how to display names, follow these steps:
1. In iChat, choose View➪Buddy Names. 
A submenu appears.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Show Full Names
• Show Short Names
• Show Handles
Deleting names and groups in a buddy list
Eventually, you might want to prune names from your buddy list to make it
easier to find the names of people you really do want to contact.

To delete a name from your buddy list, follow these steps: 
1. In iChat, click a group in your buddy list that contains the name you
want to delete.
2. Click the name you want to delete. 
3. Choose Buddies➪Remove Buddy. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete the name.
4. Click Delete (or Cancel). 
Rather than delete a name, you can also delete a group and all names stored
in that group. To delete a group from your buddy list, follow these steps: 
1. In iChat, right-click a group that you want to delete. 
A pop-up menu appears.
2. Choose Delete Group from the pop-up menu. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete this group
and all names in the group.
3. Click Delete (or Cancel). 
Chatting with Someone
After you’ve stored a list of friends in your buddy list and given your account
name to others to store in their buddy lists, you’re ready to start chatting. Of
course, before you can chat, you have to find someone who wants to chat.
You can chat with someone in three ways:
✦Text: You type messages back and forth to each other.
✦Audio: You can talk and hear the other person, much like a telephone.
✦Video: You can talk, hear, and see the other person.
Anyone on your buddy list can use text chatting, because it requires only an
Internet connection and a keyboard. (If someone doesn’t have a keyboard or
an Internet connection, he won’t be on your buddy list in the first place.)
To participate in audio chatting, each person needs a microphone and speak-
ers. Most Macs come with a built-in microphone, but you might want an exter-
nal microphone, such as one on a headset, to capture your voice clearly.
If your Internet connection is too slow, iChat might refuse to let you start an
audio or video chat.

Chatting with Someone
326
Initiating a text chat
To chat with anyone, you must first make sure that person is even available.
The easiest way to find someone to chat with is to look at your buddy list. All
names displayed in the Offline group are people unavailable at the moment.
All names displayed in other groups, such as Family or Co-Workers, are cur-
rently connected to the Internet and might be available for chatting.
Just because someone is connected to the Internet doesn’t necessary mean
that he’s in front of his computer and/or wants to chat at the moment.
Starting a text chat
To initiate a chat with someone listed in your buddy list, follow these steps:
1. In iChat, browse through your buddy list until you see the name of
someone who’s available.
2. Click a name and click the Text Chat button at the bottom of the
Buddy List window. 
A chat window appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
The last button on the right is the Start Screen Sharing button, which
lets you view the screen of another person’s computer over the Internet. 
3. Click in the text box at the bottom of the chat window, type a mes-
sage, and press Return on your keyboard.
The recipient of your message will see your message, as shown in Figure
3-6. The recipient can choose to Block, Decline, or Accept your invita-
tion. If the recipient accepts your invitation to chat, you can start typing
messages back and forth to each other. You type in the lower text box,
and your dialog with the other person appears in the main text box.

Starting a direct message text chat
When you create an ordinary text chat, your messages actually go through a
central server, which means there’s the slight possibility that someone could
intercept your messages. In case you want more security when chatting with
someone, you can initiate a direct message text chat instead. (Direct message
chatting bypasses the central server and connects your computer directly to
the other person’s computer.)
Direct messaging can sometimes be blocked by a firewall. If this happens,
you’ll have to configure your firewall to allow direct messaging.
To initiate a direct message text chat, follow these steps:
1. In iChat, browse through your buddy list until you see the name of
someone who’s available.
2. Right-click a name you want to contact and, when a pop-up menu
appears, choose Send Direct Message. 
A chat window appears (refer to Figure 3-5).
3. Click in the text box at the bottom of the chat window, type a mes-
sage, and press Return on your keyboard.
Your message shows on your buddy’s computer screen. If the recipient
accepts your invitation to chat, you can start typing messages
(securely) back and forth to each other.

tion to chat

Starting a group text chat
Instead of chatting with a single person, you might want multiple people to
chat at the same time. To create a group text chat, follow these steps:
1. In iChat, browse through your buddy list until you see the name of
someone who’s available.
2. Hold down the Ô key and click each name that you want to invite to
your group chat.
3. Click the Text Chat button at the bottom of the buddy list window. 
A chat window appears (refer to Figure 3-5).
4. Click in the text box at the bottom of the chat window, type a message
that you want everyone to see, and press Return on your keyboard.
Initiating an audio chat
To initiate an audio chat, everyone needs a microphone and speakers. You
can initiate an audio chat by following these steps:
1. In iChat, click a name on your buddy list and choose Buddies➪Invite
to Audio Chat (or click the Audio Chat button at the bottom of the
Buddy List window). 
A message appears, informing you that your audio chat invitation 
has been sent and that iChat is now waiting for a reply, as shown in
Figure 3-7.
If this feature is dimmed, that means you don’t have a microphone on
your Mac or you don’t have a fast enough Internet connection to sup-
port audio chatting.
2. Upon receiving your chat invitation on-screen, your potential chat
partner can then click the message and choose Accept or Decline. 
If your friend accepts, you can both start talking as if you were speaking
over a telephone.

You might need to drag the volume slider to adjust the sound level. If you
click the plus sign button, you can invite another person into your chat.
Initiating a video chat
To initiate a video chat, everyone’s Mac needs a microphone, speakers, and
a video camera. Most Macs have a built-in iSight video camera but for Macs
without a built-in iSight camera, you have three options:
✦Plug a digital video camcorder into your Mac’s FireWire port.
✦Buy the iMage USB webcam from Ecamm Network (www.ecamm.com).
✦Plug an ordinary USB webcam into your Mac. You might need special
software to make USB webcams work with your Mac, such as
iChatUSBCam program from Ecamm Network (www.ecamm.com).
Although Apple no longer sells them any more, you can still find and use old
iSight cameras that plug into a FireWire port. 
After everyone (up to four people) has a video camera connected to their
Macs along with a fast Internet connection (384 Kbps), you’ll be able to par-
ticipate in a video chat.
It’s possible that your Mac has a camera and a fast Internet connection, but
someone you want to contact does not. In that case, you might be stuck
using an audio or text chat instead.
You can initiate a video chat by following these steps:
1. In iChat, click a name on your buddy list and choose Buddies➪Invite
to Video Chat (or click the Video Chat button at the bottom of the
Buddy List window). 
Your invitation is sent, and a video chat window appears, showing you
what the other person will see of you, as shown in Figure 3-8.
If this feature is dimmed, that means you don’t have the necessary
equipment needed, such as not having a fast Internet connection or not
having a camera hooked up to your Mac.
2. (Optional) Choose Video➪Show Video Effects. 
A window appears, showing all the different visual effects you can
choose, as shown in Figure 3-9.
3. (Optional) Click a visual effect. 
The video chat window now shows your chosen visual effect.

4. Your potential video chat partner either accepts or declines your 
invitation.
If someone accepts your video chat invitation, your picture appears in
the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the other person’s image fills
up the rest of the screen, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Accepting (Or Blocking) a Chat Invitation
As soon as you connect to the Internet, your Mac broadcasts your availabil-
ity on buddy lists with all of your friends. The moment someone wants to
chat with you, you’ll see a window.
Chat invitations can be fun to receive, but sometimes they can get annoying.
As an alternative to taking time to click Decline on every chat invitation you
receive, iChat offers several ways to decline invitations automatically.

Changing your status
You might love receiving and accepting chat invitations, but maybe you want
to work without the distraction of chat invitations popping up on your
screen. To let others know that you’re busy at the moment, you can tem-
porarily block chat invitations. This can be handy if you plan to start chat-
ting soon, but not right away. (Otherwise, you might as well just exit iChat
altogether.) 
To keep people from contacting you, you can change the status that others
see about you in their buddy list. Instead of seeing that you’re Available, you
can change your status to Away, Out to Lunch, On the Phone, or In a
Meeting. To change your status, follow these steps:
1. Choose iChat➪My Status. 
A submenu of different status choices appears, as shown in Figure 3-11.
You can also click the pop-up menu (it displays the word Available) that
appears directly underneath your name in the Buddy List window.
2. Click a status line, such as Away or Out to lunch. 
Your chosen status now appears in the buddy lists of other people.
Figure 3-10:

Accepting (Or Blocking) a Chat Invitation
332
You can also choose a different type of status line that allows chat invita-
tions, such as Surfing the Web or Reading Email. If you choose Current
iTunes Song, people can see the name of the song you’re listening to at the
moment. If you choose Custom, you can type your own message that others
will see.
Becoming invisible
Another way to avoid receiving chat invitations is to make yourself invisible
over the iChat network. This lets you see who on your buddy list might be
available to chat, but when other people see your name on their buddy lists,
your name appears as if you are offline and disconnected from the iChat. 
To make yourself invisible over iChat, choose iChat➪My Status➪Invisible. By
being invisible, you can monitor iChat messages without others knowing
that you’re there. 
To make yourself visible again, choose iChat➪My Status and choose one of
the status lines that accepts invitations, such as Available or At Home. 
If you want others to think you’re offline and unavailable, you can choose
iChat➪My Status➪Offline. 
Accepting (or blocking) chat invitations 
with privacy levels
Rather than block invitations from everyone, you might want to accept chat
invitations from some people but block them from others. For example,
Figure 3-11:
The My
Status
submenu
provides a
variety of
status lines

Book III
Chapter 3

Real Time
Accepting (Or Blocking) a Chat Invitation
333
someone might be annoying so you always want to block that person, but
someone you like might need to reach you, so you always want that person
to get through at any time. 
When you receive an invitation, you could click the Block button every time,
but you can automate the process to selectively decide who can reach you.
In iChat, you can define different privacy levels:
✦Allow Anyone: Anyone can send you a chat invitation, even complete
strangers.
✦Allow People in My Buddy List: Allows only people you’ve stored in
your buddy list to contact you.
✦Allow Specific People: Allows you to define the names of allowed
people to contact you.
✦Block Everyone: Stops all chat invitations from friends, family, co-
workers, and everyone else in the world.
✦Block Specific People: Allows you to define the names of people you
always want to keep from contacting you.
To set your privacy level, follow these steps:
1. Choose iChat➪Preferences. 
A Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Accounts icon.
The Accounts pane appears. You can store multiple instant messaging
accounts, but you’ll probably just have a single account to choose from.
3. Click to select account listed in the Accounts pane whose privacy level
you want to change
4. Click the Security tab. 
The Security options appear, as shown in Figure 3-12.
5. Click the radio button under the Privacy Level category that corre-
sponds to your current desired privacy level.
For privacy, you might want to choose the Allow People in My Buddy
List option. 
Note: If you select the Allow Specific People or Block Specific People
radio buttons, you need to click the Edit List button to type the exact
account names of the people you want to allow or block.
6. Click the Close button of the Accounts window.

ith the worldwide connectivity of the Internet, everyone is vulnerable
to everything, including malicious software (known as malware) and
malicious people with above average computer skills (known as hackers).
Although threats over the Internet attract the most attention, your Mac is
also vulnerable from more mundane threats, such as thieves who might
want to steal your computer. 
No matter how much you know about computers, you can always become a
victim if you’re not careful. So this chapter takes a look at the different ways
to protect your Mac from both physical and cyber threats.
Locking Down Your Mac
Most people lock their car and house doors when they’re away, so your Mac
should be no exception. To physically protect your Mac, you can get a security
cable that wraps around an immovable object (like that heavy rolltop desk you
have in the den) and then attaches to your Mac. You can attach it by using
glue, by threading it through a handle or hole in your Macintosh case, or by
connecting it to a security slot built-in to your Mac. (The security slot is a tiny
slot that a security cable plugs into. You might have to peek around the back
or side of your Mac to find this security slot.) 
Some companies that sell security cables are
✦Kensington (http://us.kensington.com)
✦Targus (www.targus.com)
✦Tryten (www.tryten.com)
Security cables can be cut. The main purpose of a security cable is to deter
a thief who isn’t carrying around a pair of bolt cutters. 

Locking Down Your Mac
336
After you’ve physically protected your Mac, you have two other ways to lock
down your Mac and keep other people out. To stop intruders from sneaking
into your computer if you step away from your desk, you need to use a pass-
word. To stop intruders from sneaking into your computer over the Internet,
you need a program called a firewall. 
All security features, like locks and passwords, can always be defeated by
someone with enough time, determination, skill, and patience. Security can
only discourage and delay an intruder, but nothing can ever guarantee to
stop one.
Using passwords
Before you can ever use your Mac, you must configure it by creating an account
name and password. If you’re the only person using your Mac, you’ll probably
have just one account. If you disable automatic login, your password can keep
others from using your Mac without your knowledge. 
As a general rule, your password should be difficult for someone to guess
but easy for you to remember. Unfortunately, that often means people use
simple passwords. To make your password difficult to guess but easy to
remember, you should create a password that uses a combination of letters
and numbers, such as “checkm84u” (which sounds out the phrase “checkmate
for you”). 
Two popular ways to create passwords include taking the first letter of a
phrase that you’ll never forget or using a name of a dead pet. By picking a
memorable phrase, such as “I love my MacBook Pro” and turning it into a
nonsensical combination of letters (ILMMP), you’ll be able to remember
your password easily, but others won’t be able to guess it easily. Another
alternative is the dead pet theory of passwords where you use the name of
an animal you once owned. Presumably, nobody would ever know the name
of a dog or cat you had when you were ten years old, so the name of a dead
pet will be easy for you to remember but hard for someone to guess. 
Changing your password
For additional security, you should change your password periodically. To
change your password, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Accounts icon under the System category. 
The Accounts window appears.

3. Click the account name you want to modify under the My Account 
category in the left pane.
If you haven’t created any additional accounts, you see only your own
account listed.
4. Click the Password tab. 
The Password pane appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.
5. Click the Change Password button. 
A dialog appears, displaying text boxes for typing your old password
and then typing a new password twice to verify that you have typed
your new password correctly, as shown in Figure 4-2.

6. Enter your current password in the Old Password text box.
7. Enter your new password in the New Password text box.
8. Enter your new password one more time in the Verify text box.
9. Enter a descriptive phrase into the Password Hint text box.
Adding a hint can help you remember your password, but it can also
give an intruder a hint on what your password might be.
10. Click Change Password. 
The password dialog disappears. 
11. Click the Close button of the Accounts window. 
Applying your password
Normally, you need your password only to install new software on your Mac
or when you log in to your account. That means, though, that after you log in
to your account, anyone can use your Mac if you walk away and don’t log out.
If you leave your Mac without logging out, your Mac will either go to sleep or
display a screensaver. At this time, anyone could tap the keyboard and have
full access to your Mac. To avoid this problem, you should password-protect
your Mac when waking up from sleep or after displaying a screensaver. 
For further protection, you can also password-protect your Mac from any
changes. To keep someone from modifying the way your Mac works, you can
even password-protect the System Preferences window. By applying pass-
word protection to different parts of your Mac, you can increase the chances
that you’ll be the only one who can control your computer.
If you’re the only person who has physical access to your Mac, you won’t
have to worry about password protection, but if your Mac is in an area
where others can access it easily, password protection can be one extra step
in keeping your Mac private.
To password-protect different parts of your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Security icon under the Personal category. 
The Security window appears.
3. Click the System tab. 
The System pane appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.

5. (Optional) Select (or deselect) the Disable Automatic Login check box. 
If this check mark is deselected, your Mac won’t ask for a password
before logging into your account.
6. (Optional) Select (or deselect) the Require Password to Unlock Each
System Preferences Pane check box. 
If this check box is selected, nobody can modify the way your Mac
works without the proper password.
7. (Optional) Select (or deselect) the Log Out after ___ Minutes of
Inactivity check box. 
If selected, this option shuts down your account after a fixed period of
time so anyone trying to access your computer will need your password
to access your account.
Two additional check boxes appear, labeled Use Secure Virtual Memory
and Disable Remote Control Infrared Receiver. The Secure Virtual Memory
option means that your Mac will encrypt the temporary data that almost
every program stores on your hard drive while the program is running. If
you don’t use secure virtual memory, other people might be able to read
this temporary data that can remain on your hard drive even after you
turn off your computer. Disabling the remote control infrared receiver
simply keeps someone from controlling your Mac using an infrared remote
control. (This option won’t appear if your Mac doesn’t have an infrared
receiver, such as a Mac Pro.)

Configuring a firewall
When you connect your Mac to the Internet, you essentially open a door to
your Mac that allows anyone in the world to access your computer, copy or
modify your files, or erase all your data. To keep out unwanted intruders,
every computer needs a special program called a firewall.
A firewall simply blocks access to your computer while still allowing you
access to the Internet so you can look at Web sites or send and receive e-mail.
Every Mac comes with a built-in firewall that can protect you whenever your
Mac connects to the Internet. 
Many people use a special device, called a router, to connect to the Internet.
A router lets multiple computers use a single Internet connection, such as a
high-speed Internet connection. Many routers also include built-in firewalls,
but it’s still a good idea to use a firewall on your Mac for additional protection. 
Although the default setting for this built-in firewall should be adequate for
most people, you might want to configure your firewall to block additional
Internet features for added security. For example, most people will likely
need to access e-mail and Web pages, but if you never transfer files using
FTP (File Transfer Protocol), you can safely block this service. 
Don’t configure your firewall unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing.
Otherwise, you might weaken the firewall or lock programs from accessing
the Internet and not know how to repair those problems.
To configure the built-in firewall, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click on the Security icon under the Personal category. 
The Security window appears.
3. Click the Firewall tab. 
The Firewall pane appears, as shown in Figure 4-4.
4. Click the Advanced button. 
The dialog that appears offers two check boxes. 
5. Select (or deselect) the following check boxes:
• Enable Firewall Logging: Maintains a record (log) of what the firewall has
blocked. This can be useful to check whether the firewall is working.
• Enable Stealth Mode: Makes the firewall refuse to respond to any outside
attempts to contact it and gather information based on its responses.

Buying a firewall
Although the built-in Mac firewall works well, it only blocks incoming connec-
tions but allows all outgoing connections. Allowing all outgoing connections
means a malicious program could communicate over the Internet without
your knowledge. To prevent this problem, you need a firewall that can block
both incoming and outgoing connections.
You should use only one software firewall at a time, although it’s possible to
use one software firewall and a hardware firewall built into your router. If
you use two or more software firewall programs, they may interfere with
each other and crash your computer or keep each other from working.
If you want a more robust firewall than the one that comes with the Mac,
consider one of the following:
✦NetBarrier (www.intego.com)
✦Norton Personal Firewall (www.symantec.com)
Dealing with spyware and RATs
On computers running Microsoft Windows,
there are two big threats that exploit firewalls
that don’t block outgoing connections. The first
of these threats, known as spyware, consists of
programs that sneak on to your computer and
then secretly connect to the Internet to retrieve
ads that appear all over your screen. 
A second type of program that requires an out-
going Internet connection is known as a RAT
(Remote Access Trojan). Malicious hackers
often trick people into downloading and
installing a RAT on their computer. When it’s
installed, a RAT can connect to the Internet and
allow the malicious hacker to completely con-
trol the computer remotely over the Internet,
including deleting or copying files, conducting
attacks through this other person’s computer or
sending junk e-mail (spam) through this other
computer. 
Although spyware and RATs are mostly
restricted to Windows computers, there’s a
good chance that spyware and RATs will soon
start infecting Mac computers as more people
use the Mac. To guard against spyware and
RATs, your Mac displays a dialog alerting you
when you’re running a program for the first
time. This feature can alert you if spyware or a
RAT tries to infect a Mac, but for further pro-
tection, consider a firewall that can block out-
going Internet connections.

Locking Down Your Mac
343
One problem with a firewall is that, in the normal scheme of things, you never
really know how well it’s working. To help you measure the effectiveness of
your current firewall, visit one of the following sites that will probe and test
your computer, looking for the exact same vulnerabilities that hackers will
look for. 
✦Audit My PC (www.auditmypc.com)
✦HackerWatch (www.hackerwatch.org/probe)
✦Shields Up! (www.grc.com)
✦Symantec Security Check (http://security.symantec.com)
Because each firewall-testing Web site might test for different features, test-
ing your Mac with two or more of the above sites can help ensure that your
Mac is as secure as possible. Figure 4-5 shows the Shields Up! results from a
test of the built-in Mac firewall.

Creating Multiple Accounts

Creating Multiple Accounts
Every Mac needs at least one account that allows you to use your computer.
However, if multiple people need to use your Mac, you probably don’t want to
share the same account, which can be like trying to share the same pair of
pants.
One problem with sharing the same account is that one person might change
the screensaver or delete a program that someone else might want. To avoid
people interfering with each other, you can divide your Mac into multiple
accounts. 
Multiple accounts basically give your Mac a split personality. Each account
lets each person customize the same Mac while shielding other users from
these changes. So one account can display pink daffodils on the screen, and
a second account can display pictures of sports cars in the background. 
To access any account, you need to log in to that account. To exit an
account, you need to log out. 
Not only do separate accounts keep multiple users from accessing each
other’s files, but creating multiple accounts also gives you the ability to
restrict what other accounts can do. That means you can block Internet
access from an account, limit Internet access to specific times, or limit
Internet access to specific Web sites. (It’s great for parents, of course, which
is why such limits are referred to as parental controls.)
To protect your files and settings, you should create a separate account for
each person who uses your Mac. You can create four types of accounts:
✦Administrator: Gives the user access to create, modify, and delete
accounts. You should have only one Administrator account.
✦Standard: Gives the user access to the computer, but doesn’t let the
user create, modify, or delete accounts.
✦Managed with Parental Controls: Gives the user restricted access to
the computer based on the parental controls defined by an
Administrator account.
✦Guest: Gives the user access, but any files the user saves on the hard
drive will get deleted when the guest account logs off.
The only difference between the Administrator and Standard accounts is
that the Standard account cannot create, modify, or delete other accounts.
Otherwise, a Standard account gives users unrestricted freedom to do 
anything they want on the Mac.

Your Mac

345
The Managed with Parental Controls and Guest accounts give users restricted
access to what they can do on your Mac. The main difference is that a Guest
account cannot save any files. 
Creating a Managed with Parental Controls account
If you want users to be able to save files but you still want to restrict their
access to the Internet or certain programs, you want to create a Managed
with Parental Controls account. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Accounts icon under the System category. 
The Accounts window appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
3. Click the Lock icon in the bottom-left corner to give you the ability to
add or create accounts. 
A dialog appears, asking for your password.
4. Enter your password in the Password text box and then click OK.
The dialog disappears, and you’re back in the Accounts window.

5. Click the Add Account (plus sign) icon. 
An Accounts dialog appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
6. Choose Managed with Parental Controls from the New Account pop-up
menu. 
Instead of choosing Managed with Parental Controls, you can instead
choose Administrator or Standard to create an Administrator or
Standard account.
7. Enter the name of the person who’ll be using the account into the
Name text box.
8. (Optional) Click in the Short Name text box and edit the short name
that your Mac automatically creates.
9. Enter a password for this account in the Password text box. 
10. Re-enter the password you chose in step 9 into the Verify text box.
11. (Optional) Enter a descriptive phrase to help remind you of your 
password into the Password Hint text box. 
12. (Optional) Select the Turn on FileVault Protection check box, which
allows the account user to encrypt files. 
If you allow users to encrypt files, they will be able to hide the contents
of their files from anyone — even folks with an Administrator account. 
Keep in mind that turning on FileVault can make your Mac slower
because it needs to take time to encrypt and decrypt your data. 
If you turn on FileVault and forget your password, you’ll never be able to
access the FileVault encrypted data.

Creating a Guest account
A Guest account is handy if you want multiple users to access your Mac. (If
you have a Mac in a public lobby for anyone to use, for example, you want
them to use only a Guest account.) 
You can create only one Guest account because multiple users will access
the same Guest account. To create a Guest account, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Accounts icon under the System category. 
The Accounts window appears (refer to Figure 4-7).

The dialog disappears and you’re back in the Accounts pane.
5. Click the Guest Account icon that appears in the left pane of the
Accounts window, as shown in Figure 4-8.
6. Select the Allow Guests to Log into This Computer check box, which
allows anyone to use your Mac’s Guest account without needing a
password.
7. (Optional) Select or deselect the Allow Guests to Connect to Shared
Folders check box. 
If this option is selected, a Guest account will be able to read files cre-
ated by other accounts and stored in a special shared folder. 
8. Click the Close button of the Accounts window.

Defining parental controls for a Guest account or a 
Managed with Parental Controls account
You can apply parental controls only to a Guest account or a Managed with
Parental Controls account. After you’ve created a Guest account or at least
one Managed with Parental Controls account, you can apply parental
controls to those accounts. 
There are several types of restrictions you can place on an account:
✦System: Limits which programs the account can run.
✦Content: Limits which Web sites the account can access.
✦Mail & iChat: Limits the account to sending and receiving e-mail and
instant messages from a fixed list of approved people.
✦Time Limits: Prevents accessing the account at certain times or days.
✦Simple Finder: Displays a simple Finder that’s easier to use.
✦Administer Printers: Prevents modifications to the printers connected
to the Macintosh.
✦Burn CDs and DVDs: Prevents saving data to a CD or DVD.
✦Password: Prevents changing the account password.
✦Dock: Prevents modifying the Dock.
To apply parental controls to an account, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.

Monitoring a parental control managed account
After you create a Managed with Parental Controls account, you can view
what that user has been doing on your Mac by reviewing the log files. The
log files keep track of all the Web sites the user visited, tried to visit (and got
blocked by the Mac parental controls), the programs run, and the people
contacted through iChat. To view these log files, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Parental Controls icon under the System category.
The Parental Controls window appears (refer to Figure 4-10).
3. Click the account icon, in the left pane, whose log files you want to
examine.
4. Click the Logs tab. 
The Logs pane appears, as shown in Figure 4-14.
5. Choose a time period for viewing from the Show Activity For pop-up
menu, such as everything the user did in the past week or month.
6. Choose Website or Date from the Group By pop-up menu.

(and failed) to access. If you peek at the Applications or iChat lists, you
can see which programs ran on the account or which iChat addresses
the account contacted. 
Not all blocked Web sites are necessarily pornographic. Sometimes a
blocked Web site could just be a blocked pop-up ad from an acceptable site.
8. Click the Close button of the Parental Controls window.
Dealing with Junk E-Mail
As soon as you get an e-mail address, you’re going to start receiving junk e-mail,
and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. However, the Mail program gives you
tools for handling the inevitable flow of junk e-mail so you can keep your e-mail
account from getting overwhelmed. Two ways to manage your junk e-mail are
by bouncing junk e-mail back to the sender or by filtering junk e-mail into a 
special junk folder.
Figure 4-14:
The Logs
pane lets
you

what the

Book III
Chapter 4

Dealing with Junk E-Mail
355
Most junk e-mail messages are advertisements trying to sell you various
products, but some junk e-mail are actually scams to trick you into visiting
bogus Web sites that ask for your credit card number. Other times, junk
e-mail might offer a malicious program, such as a computer virus, and try to
trick you into downloading and installing it on your computer. By filtering
out such malicious junk e-mail, you can keep your Mac safe.
Bouncing junk e-mail
When spammers send out e-mail, the majority of their messages get sent to
nonexistent e-mail addresses. When this occurs, the mail server computer
bounces the message back to the sender so the sender knows that the e-mail
address is invalid. Then the spammer knows not to waste time sending that
nonexistent e-mail address any more messages.
Fortunately, you can take advantage of this feature by bouncing unwanted
messages back to the sender. When you bounce a message back to the sender,
this bounced message makes it appear as if your e-mail address is invalid
(although it’s really not). Then the spammer will likely remove your e-mail
address from the mailing list, so you’ll receive less junk e-mail. 
That’s the theory, anyway. In real life, this can work if the spammer sent
e-mail from a valid e-mail address. If the spammer sent junk e-mail through
another computer (such as one hijacked without the owner’s knowledge),
bouncing e-mail will never reach the spammer, and your e-mail address will
still continue receiving junk e-mail.
Figure 4-15:
In the Logs
pane, the
Websites
Blocked list
lets you see

Web sites

tried to visit.

Dealing with Junk E-Mail
356
Although not perfect, bouncing junk e-mail back to its sender may help
reduce your junk e-mail. To bounce a message, follow these steps: 
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
A list of messages appears in the right pane.
2. Click a message that you consider to be junk.
3. Choose Message➪Bounce. 
A dialog appears, letting you know that bouncing messages works only if
your unwanted message came from a valid e-mail address.
4. Click the Bounce button (or click Cancel). 
Bouncing e-mail is more effective when you know the sender’s e-mail address
is valid, such as bouncing messages sent to you from an ex-boyfriend/girlfriend
or spouse.
Filtering junk e-mail
More effective than bouncing is filtering. Filtering means that Mail examines
the content of messages and tries to determine whether the message is junk.
To improve accuracy, the Mail program will let you train it by letting you
manually identify junk e-mail that its existing rules didn’t catch. 
After a few weeks of watching you identify junk e-mail, the Mail program’s filters
will eventually recognize common junk e-mail so it can route it automatically to
a special junk folder. By doing this, the Mail program can keep your inbox
free from most junk e-mail so you can focus on reading the messages that 
are actually important.
To train the Mail program to recognize junk e-mail, follow these steps:
1. In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
A list of messages appears in the right pane.
2. Click a message that you consider to be junk.
3. Click the Junk icon. 
This tells the Mail program’s filters what you consider to be junk e-mail.
4. Click the Delete icon at the top of the Mail window. 
This deletes your chosen message and “trains” Mail to recognize similar
messages as junk.

Although Mail’s built-in junk e-mail filters can strip away most junk e-mail,
consider getting a special junk e-mail filter as well. These e-mail filters
strip out most junk e-mail better than Mail can do, but any junk e-mail that
slips past these separate filters might later be caught by Mail’s filters, which
essentially doubles your defenses against junk e-mail. Some popular e-mail
filters are SpamSieve (http://c-command.com), Spamfire (www.matter
form.com), and Personal Antispam (www.intego.com). Spam filters cost
money and take time to configure, but if your e-mail account is getting overrun
by junk e-mail, a separate junk e-mail filter might be your only solution short of
getting a new e-mail account altogether.

A
fter browsing the Internet and visiting different Web sites, you might
get the urge to create your own Web site. If you own a business, a Web
site can promote and advertise your services and products. If you can sell
something that’s easy to ship (such as books or posters as opposed to lead
pipes or truck axles), you can set up on online store and sell products over
the Internet. 
Even if you don’t have your own business, you can still take advantage of a
Web site to promote yourself and your accomplishments. This can come in
handy particularly if you’re looking to promote yourself at your company or
when looking for a new job. Think of a Web site as an online résumé that can
highlight your services or skills.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Instead of creating a Web site for
business, you might be more interested in creating a Web site for fun, such
as promoting a hobby like raising tropical fish or collecting stamps. In this
case, a Web site can be like having your own newsletter that anyone in the
world can access and read.
Whatever your reasons for developing a Web site, your Mac can help you
create your own online presence on the Internet with the least amount of
hassle and the most amount of fun and enjoyment.
If you want a superfast and convenient way to set up your own Web site,
skip ahead to the “Using .Mac” section at the end of this chapter.

Types of Web Sites
360
Types of Web Sites
The basic idea behind any Web site is that you create your Web pages on
your computer and then copy them to another computer that’s connected to
the Internet. This other computer, called a server, hosts your Web pages for
the whole world to see. 
The main reason you need to upload your Web pages on another computer
(the server) is because the server is connected to a high-speed Internet con-
nection (called a T1 or T3 line) that allows thousands of people to view your
Web site simultaneously. A typical home Internet connection (dial-up or
Ethernet) isn’t fast enough to support hordes of people visiting your Web
site at the same time. 
At the simplest level, a Web page can consist of nothing but text. However, to
make a Web page more visually appealing and inviting to read, most Web pages
spice up their appearance with decorative graphics or colors. If static graphic
images look too boring, you can add animated menus or short movies to make
your Web site more interactive. To help design visually interesting Web pages,
you often need to use a special Web page editing program.
After you’ve created your Web pages, you need to find a server computer
that can display your Web pages (also known as hosting a Web site) on the
Internet. Some popular Web site hosting options are:
✦Free, advertiser supported Web site hosts
✦Free, ISP (Internet Service Provider) Web site hosts
✦Fee-based Web site hosts
Free, advertiser-sponsored Web site hosts
Because so many people like the idea of putting up their own Web sites, many
companies offer free Web hosting to attract as many people as possible. In
return for giving you storage space to host your Web pages, these free Web
site hosts support themselves by displaying banner or pop-up ads all over
your Web pages. If someone wants to visit your Web site, he or she might
have to wade through some advertisements first. 
Even worse, you can’t control what type of advertisements might appear on
your Web site. If you create a Web site praising American-built cars and
encouraging people to support American autoworkers, the Web site host
might stick advertisements for Honda or Toyota cars all over your Web
pages, and there’s nothing you can do about it. 

Book III
Chapter 5
Setting Up Your 
Own Web Site
Types of Web Sites
361
Another drawback of free, advertiser-sponsored Web site hosts is that the
specific Web site address will never be anything as simple as www.apple.com.
Instead, free Web site hosts force you to use a convoluted Web site address
that includes the Web site host name. So if you host your Web pages on a free
site called Tripod or Geocities, your Web site’s address might look like this:
http://mysite.tripod.com 
or
http://www.geocities.com/mysite/2397
Such lengthy, nonintuitive Web site addresses work just like the simpler,
more descriptive www.mysite.com, but they’re harder to remember and
even harder to type in correctly. Telling someone to visit www.mysite.com
is easy to say and even easier to print on a business card. Telling someone to
visit http://www.geocities.com/mysite/2397 is much clumsier to say
and even more confusing to write. 
Despite the drawbacks of free, advertiser-supported Web site hosts, you
can’t overlook the fact that they’re free to use, try, and play with for as long
as you want. This gives you a chance to create and post your Web pages just
to gain experience in designing aesthetically appealing Web pages and
uploading them from your computer to a Web server computer.
By using a free Web hosting service, you can see whether you have the stamina
to maintain and update a Web site regularly. Many people rush to create a Web
site, furiously update and modify it for the first week, and then gradually lose
interest and eventually abandon their site altogether. You can use a free Web
hosting service as a trial before you shell out money for a fee-based Web hosting
service.
Bottom Line: Because of their advertisements and non-intuitive Web site
address, free Web site hosting services are fine for personal use or to gain
experience designing and uploading Web pages, but you probably don’t want
to use them for business purposes. Some popular, free, advertiser-supported
Web site hosting services are
✦Geocities (http://geocities.yahoo.com)
✦Tripod (www.tripod.lycos.com)
✦Google Pages (http://pages.google.com)
✦FortuneCity (www.fortunecity.com)
Although all of these Web hosting services are free, they offer different
amounts of storage space and ads that appear on your Web pages, so com-
pare these services until you find one that you like best.

Types of Web Sites
362
Free ISP Web site hosts
When you pay for Internet service from an Internet Service Provider (ISP),
your ISP might throw in free Web site hosting as a bonus. Unlike advertiser-
supported Web site hosting services that bury ads in your Web pages without
your consent, free ISP Web site hosting services don’t. The ISP figures that
you’re already paying it for its service, so Web site hosting is just a marketing
tactic to entice people to sign up with that ISP anyway.
As a result, ISP Web site hosting gives you the benefits of experimenting with
a free Web site without the drawbacks of unwanted advertisements. However,
your Web site address will still likely contain something convoluted and non-
intuitive like http://www.ispname.net/myname/4872. 
Of course, not every ISP offers free Web site hosting as part of your ordinary
Internet subscription. Some ISPs charge extra, and others don’t offer free Web
site hosting at all. If your ISP doesn’t offer free Web site hosting, you’ll be forced
to use a different Web site host or switch to a different ISP altogether. 
Social networking Web sites
The latest trend among free Web site hosting is
social networking sites such as MySpace
(www.myspace.com) 
and 
Facebook
(www.facebook.com). Social networking
sites are free because they insert advertise-
ments on everybody’s Web pages. Unlike ordi-
nary advertiser-supported Web site hosts,
social networking sites won’t always let you
create your own Web pages on your computer.
Instead, you have to create Web pages by cus-
tomizing the social networking site’s templates.
The main advantage of social networking sites
is that they make it easy for you to link your
Web pages to other people’s Web pages on the
same social networking site.
The idea behind social networking sites is to
give people a chance to express themselves
and link up with friends and like-minded people.
For instance, you could start a vegetarian cook-
ing Web site and link your page with other veg-
etarians’ Web pages. 
If you want to meet hikers or sailing enthusi-
asts, social networking sites can help you find
new friends. If you want to sell beef jerky
online, social networking sites may not be the
place to start a Web site any more than a cock-
tail party would be the place to hold a garage
sale. 
Social networking sites can be useful for busi-
ness networking though. Connect with other
computer programmers, graphic design artists,
or construction workers and share tips for find-
ing and looking for a job. A social networking
site can be fun and useful for communicating
with others in your line of work.

Chapter 5

Because of the lack of obtrusive ads, Web sites hosted on free ISP Web sites
are more often used for personal use rather than setting up on-line stores.
(Some ISPs might even restrict businesses from setting up business sites due
to the bandwidth problems that might occur if too many people visit the
Web site every day.) 
Fee-based Web site hosting service
Free Web site hosting services can be great for having fun or teaching your-
self how to design Web pages and upload them on a Web server. However,
free Web site hosting services often limit the amount of storage space you
can use. The less storage space available, the fewer Web pages, graphic
images, and additional files (such as sound or video) you can put on your
Web site. If you want a Web site with no ads, more storage space, and a
descriptive Web site address (called a domain name), you’ll need to pay a
fee-based Web site hosting service. 
Many advertiser-supported Web hosts offer both a free and a subscription-
based plan. The free plan lets you create Web sites that include ads and
a bizarre Web site address. The fee-based plan removes ads and gives you a
descriptive Web site address such as www.apple.com. By offering a free and
fee-based plan, these Web site hosting services give you the option of experi-
menting with designing a Web site and then transferring it to its own domain
name (like www.symantec.com) without having to change Web site hosting
companies.  
The first step to using a fee-based Web site hosting service is to compare
prices and features offered. Prices vary from as low as $1.99 a month to as
high as $19.99 a month or more, depending on what additional options you
might want. (What one Web site hosting service might consider an option,
another might throw in free as part of its basic package.) Some basic features
to look for are
✦Storage space: The more storage space, the more Web pages, pictures,
videos, animation, and so on you can post on your Web site. Typical
storage space ranges from 10GB up to 250GB or more. If your Web site
needs to store files, especially audio or video files, you need more space
than someone who just wants to display a picture of a pet lizard.
✦File transfer limitation: Defines how much data others can copy off your
Web site. A high transfer rate might be necessary if you offer files for
people to download, such as pictures or music files. 
✦Number of e-mail accounts: The more e-mail accounts offered, the
better. If you’re running a company Web site, you don’t want to bump
into a limitation of only 12 e-mail accounts if your company suddenly
starts growing.

Types of Web Sites

✦E-mail storage space: The more storage space, the more messages all of
your e-mail accounts can hold. If you don’t have enough e-mail storage
space, it’s possible to fill your e-mail accounts to the brim with too many
messages, which you’ll then have to erase to make room for new messages. 
✦Domain name registration: If you want your Web site to have a descriptive
address like www.logitech.com, you need to register that particular
name so no one else can use it. For convenience, many Web hosting
services will register a domain name at a low price. Otherwise, you’ll
have to register the domain name yourself.
✦Number of domain names: Some Web site hosting services let you use
only one domain name. If you want to create two or more Web sites,
you’ll have to pay more. Other Web site hosting services let you host
multiple domain names for one low price. 
After you pick a Web hosting service, you need to pick a domain name for
your Web site. Many domain names are already taken (such as www.white
house.gov or www.foxnews.com). 
To check whether a domain name is already taken, do a search on a site like
Whois.net (www.whois.net). 
After you decide on a descriptive domain name, you need to register it either
through your Web site hosting service or through a separate domain name
registration service. 
Registration means picking a name that no one else is using, paying a one-
time fee, and then paying periodic fees to maintain that domain name. If you
don’t continue paying to maintain your domain name, you’ll lose it. Registration
fees typically cost $5 to $25 a year, although some Web site hosting services
will pay this fee for you as long as you keep using their services.
After you pick a Web site hosting service and register a domain name, you can
always transfer your domain name (and all your Web page files) to a different
Web site hosting service that offers lower rates or better service. 
Multiple domain names can point to the same Web site. This can be handy to
ensure that people reach your Web site no matter what Web site address they
use. For example, the official Trend Micro Web site domain name is http://
us.trendmicro.com, but you can also visit Trend Micro’s Web site by using
the www.antivirus.com domain name. In case you want to redirect a
domain name that you own (such as www.microsoft.com) to a cryptic
Web site address (such as www.freeweb.com/3940/4937), you can use
DyNS (www.dyns.cx). 
After you’ve picked and registered a domain name and paid to use a specific
Web hosting service, you’ll be ready to create and upload your Web pages.

Creating Web Pages
Creating a Web page can be as simple or as difficult as you want to make it. If
you want to slap together a simple Web page, you can do that in about five
minutes. If you have a specific design for a Web page that involves custom
graphics and fancy animation, that might take you a few days, a few weeks,
or more.
To create a Web page, you have four options:
✦Write HTML (HyperText Markup Language) code using a text editor.
✦Use a general-purpose program, such as a word processor or desktop
publishing program, to save a document as an HTML file.
✦Use a built-in Web page creation program offered by your Web site hosting
service, such as Yahoo! Site Builder or Google Page Creator. These pro-
grams simplify the process of creating and editing Web pages, but you
can use them to create Web pages only for that particular site. 
✦Use a dedicated Web page creation program, such as iWeb.
You actually have a fifth option, and that’s to pay someone else to create a
Web site for you. For business owners who don’t want the hassle of creating
and maintaining a Web site, this option is probably the best, but if you want
to create a Web site honoring your cat or goldfish, it’s much cheaper to
create Web pages yourself. 
Creating a Web page with HTML code
The most primitive, but most powerful way to create a Web page is by writ-
ing HTML code. Every Web page, no matter how simple or how complicated,
consists of nothing but HTML code that defines exactly what to display. (To
create fancy visual effects such as pull-down menus, Web pages might also
use programs or languages such as Flash or JavaScript.)
If you want to peek at the HTML code that defines your favorite Web page, visit
that Web page in Safari and then choose View➪View Source to get a listing of
the page’s code, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Although HTML code might look confusing, it’s actually fairly simple to learn.
Then again, learning how to change your car’s oil or how to replace a leaky
toilet is also fairly simple, but most people don’t want to do it.

Creating Web Pages
366
To design Web pages in HTML code, start off by learning about how HTML
codes work. (Pick up a copy of HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 6th Edition,
by Ed Tittel and Jeff Noble). Next, you need to use a text editor, which is a
special program often used to write programs or HTML commands. Unlike a
word processor, a text editor won’t wrap your words to the next line or change
fonts. The most popular text editor for the Mac is BBEdit (www.barebones.
com). If you don’t want to pay for a text editor like BBEdit, get the free, less-
featured version of BBEdit called TextWrangler. For another free text editor
for writing HTML code, get Taco HTML Edit (http://tacosw.com). 
Creating Web pages with other programs
Almost every program (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, and
desktop publishing) can save documents as HTML files, with the extension
.html. To check whether your favorite program can do so, follow these
steps:
1. Choose File➪Save As. 
A Save As dialog appears. 
With some programs, you might be able to choose File➪Export.
2. Look for a file format option such as Web Page or HTML File, as
shown in Figure 5-2. 
If you find this option, the program can save documents as HTML files.
Figure 5-1:

page

HTML code.

Book III
Chapter 5

Creating Web Pages
367
The advantage of using your favorite word processor or presentation program
to create a Web page is that you don’t have to learn anything new (other than
how to save your documents as an HTML file). The disadvantage of creating
Web pages from your favorite program is that you might still need to customize
the Web page to include other features. For example, to add navigation buttons
on your Web page, you have to edit that Web page in an HTML editor or
dedicated Web page designing program instead. 
Creating Web pages with dedicated 
Web page designers
If you’re serious about designing Web pages, you should get a dedicated Web
page designing program. Such programs often give you a choice of designing
a Web page graphically (by plopping graphic images on a page around boxes
filled with text) or by editing or writing HTML code. 
Often times you can start designing a Web page visually and then switch to
tweaking the HTML code to make your Web page look exactly the way you
want. By giving you this dual capability for creating a Web page, dedicated
Web page designing programs give you the most control over the appearance
of your Web pages.
There are two types of dedicated Web page designing programs: consumer
and professional versions. Web page designing programs designed for con-
sumers are much easier to use because they offer fewer features for modifying
a Web page. 
For a free, consumer version Web page designing program, grab a copy of Nvu
(www.nvu.com). If you’re willing to pay for a Web page designing program, try
RapidWeaver (www.realmacsoftware.com), Freeway
(www.softpress.com), or Coda (www.panic.com).
Figure 5-2:
Web pages

the HTML
file format.

Uploading Web Pages
368
Every Mac includes a free Web page designing program, iWeb, which can
create Web pages quickly and easily. See Book IV, Chapter 4 for more infor-
mation about using iWeb.
If you want to use a Web page designing program that the professionals use,
be prepared to spend a few hundred dollars to get a copy of Dreamweaver
(www.adobe.com). Besides using Dreamweaver, professional Web designers
might also use Photoshop (to create or edit digital photographs) along with
Illustrator and Flash (to create animation). 
No matter how you create a Web page, the end result will always be an HTML
file along with other files such as graphic images. So it’s entirely possible to
create a Web page in Dreamweaver, edit it in Nvu or RapidWeaver, and then
tweak it further using BBEdit. The type of program you use to create a Web
page is less important than your skill in designing and creating a Web page. 
Uploading Web Pages
After you’ve created one or more Web pages, they’re trapped on your computer.
To share your Web pages over the Internet, you need to transfer the files to a
Web site hosting service. (Web site folks refer to this as uploading your files.)
The most common way to transfer Web page files from your computer to a
Web site server computer is to use something called FTP (File Transfer
Protocol). 
To use FTP, you need a special program called an FTP client. The FTP client
lets you choose one or more files to transfer off your hard drive and then
copy those files to a specific location on the Web site hosting computer. 
When you transfer files through FTP, you must make sure you transfer all files.
Typically, a Web page consists of the Web page itself (an HTML file) and one or
more graphic images that appear on that Web page (often stored as GIF or JPG
files). If you forget to transfer a graphic image with your Web page, your Web
page will appear without that graphic image, which can leave a noticeable gap
in your Web page. 
Also when transferring files through FTP, you must know the exact location
to store your Web page files on the Web site server computer, which you can
get from your Web site hosting service. If you store your Web page and graphic
files in the wrong folder, your Web page won’t appear correctly when viewed
over the Internet.
Some popular free FTP client programs include Cyberduck (http://cyber
duck.ch), RBroser (www.rbrowser.com), and NcFTP Client (www.ncftp
.com). If you feel better about buying a commercial FTP client, buy a copy of
Transmit (www.panic.com) or Fetch (www.fetchsoftworks.com).

Setting Up Your 
Own Web Site
Using .Mac
369
Using .Mac
To create your own Web site, you need to take care of finding a Web site
hosting service, designing your own Web pages, transferring your Web page
files and graphic images using an FTP client, and knowing the exact location
to store all your files. You might also need to worry about registering a domain
name if you want a descriptive address like www.cbsnews.com. If all this
sounds clumsy and complicated, you’re right. 
To make designing Web pages easy, you can use iWeb, but to make creating and
posting a Web site easy, you can use the optional .Mac Web hosting service.
(.Mac costs $99 a year, but Apple offers a free 60-day trial and places like
Amazon.com might sell a .Mac subscription at a discount.)
The main idea behind .Mac is to eliminate the minor details necessary to create
a Web site. You don’t have to worry about finding a Web site hosting service
(you just use .Mac), and you don’t have to worry about finding an FTP client
and learning how to use it. Instead, you just have to choose File➪Publish to
.Mac from within iWeb to transfer your files and store them in the right place
automatically. 
More about .Mac
The .Mac service is actually more than just a
Web site hosting service. First, .Mac offers a
traditional Web site hosting service along with
the ability to just post your digital photographs
and movies directly from iPhoto and iMovie. If
all you want to do with a Web site is post pic-
tures for others to see, you can skip the whole
process of creating Web pages altogether and
go straight to posting pictures and videos using
.Mac.
Second, .Mac offers the ability to copy and
store all your important files on Apple’s own
computers. That way if a fire torches your
house or a Russian spy satellite plummets out
of orbit and smashes into your apartment
(crushing your Mac and your external hard
drive at the same time), your files will still be
safely stored on .Mac. 
Third, .Mac subscribers often receive offers for
free or discounted software along with tutori-
als for using different types of programs. If you
take advantage of enough of these software
offers, you might save enough money to justify
the cost of your .Mac subscription.
Finally, .Mac gives you yet another e-mail
account as part of its price. Unlike other types
of e-mail accounts, .Mac won’t automatically
attach an advertisement to your e-mail mes-
sages. Although you can get a free e-mail
account from many sites such as Yahoo! or
Google, having yet another e-mail account is a
nice option, especially if your current e-mail
accounts are getting overrun with junk e-mail
and you want to start fresh with a new e-mail
account.

Using .Mac
370
As wonderful as .Mac sounds, here’s why you might want to think twice
about subscribing to .Mac:
✦The cost is steep. At $99 a year, .Mac isn’t the least expensive Web site
hosting option available. For the same amount of money, you might find
a Web site hosting service that offers more storage and features than .Mac.
✦You might not be using iWeb and iPhoto. Both iWeb and iPhoto are
great programs, but if you use another Web page designing program
(such as Dreamweaver) or another digital photo organizing and editing
program (such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom), all the slick integration
of .Mac with iPhoto and iWeb will be useless.
✦You might not need the extra features of .Mac. Offline storage might be
nice, but you can find many free or less expensive offsite storage sites
such as ElephantDrive (www.elephantdrive.com), XDrive (http://
xdrive.com), or MediaMax (www.mediamax.com). Having another e-mail
account might also be convenient, but you can create virtually an unlimited
number of free e-mail accounts on dozens of different Web sites. 
When you first turned on your Mac, Apple probably tried to convince you to
sign up for .Mac. If you resisted this low-key sales pitch, you can still join
.Mac by visiting www.apple.com/dotmac and signing up for your free trial
or (if you’re already convinced) an annual .Mac subscription plan. 
The .Mac service offers the easiest way to create your own Web sites with a
minimum of hassle, so if the traditional way of setting up a Web site sounds
too confusing or time-consuming, sign up for .Mac and start posting your Web
sites right away. You might find the convenience of .Mac is worth the cost.

T
hink of iPhoto as a place where you can dump your digital photographs
so you can find them again later. In iPhoto, all your pictures get stored in
a Library. The Library provides three ways to organize your pictures:
✦Events 
✦Albums
✦Folders
Events typically contain pictures captured on the same day. Albums typically
contain pictures grouped by a common theme, such as pictures of animals
or cars. Folders can hold and organize multiple albums. 
You find out more about creating folders and albums later in this chapter, in
the “Storing pictures in albums and folders” section.
After organizing your pictures, iPhoto also lets you edit your pictures to
modify colors or clip out unwanted portions. When your pictures look perfect,
you can print them on either your own printer or (for an added cost) through a
printing service. From start to finish, iPhoto can take care of organizing your
pictures so you can focus on taking even more pictures.
Importing Pictures
Before you can organize your pictures, you need to store them in iPhoto. If
you have pictures stored in other folders on your hard drive, on other storage
devices (such as CDs or DVDs), or trapped inside a digital camera, the first
step is to copy those pictures into iPhoto.

Importing Pictures
374
To copy pictures into iPhoto — or, to use the accepted lingo, to import pictures
into iPhoto — follow these steps:
1. Insert or connect the storage device — thumb drive, digital camera,
CD, whatever — that contains the pictures you want to import into
iPhoto. 
If your pictures are already stored in a folder on your hard drive, skip
this step.
2. Load iPhoto. 
Double-click the iPhoto icon in the Applications folder, or click the
iPhoto icon in the Dock. The iPhoto window appears.
3. Choose File➪Import to Library. 
An Import Photos dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-1.
4. Click the drive, in the far left column, that contains the pictures you
want to import.
5. Choose one of the following:
• Click the folder, in the middle column, that contains the pictures you
want to import. (This selects all pictures in that folder.)
• Double-click the folder, in the middle column, that contains the pictures
you want to import and then click on the picture, in the right column,
that you want to import. (To select multiple pictures, hold down the Ô
key and click each picture. To select a range of pictures, click the first
picture you want to import, hold down the Shift key, and then click
the last picture to import to highlight all the pictures in between.)

6. Click Import. 
iPhoto imports your pictures and organizes them into an Event.
A fast way to import pictures into iPhoto is to drag and drop those pictures
over the iPhoto icon in the Dock.
Organizing Events in the Library
The iPhoto Library can store literally thousands of pictures, which can soon
get as disorganized as dumping a decade’s worth of photographs in a closet
and then wondering why you can never find a specific picture easily. 
Just as most people organize pictures in albums, boxes, or bags, so can
iPhoto organize groups of pictures in one place. In iPhoto, a group of related
pictures is called an Event.
The main purpose of Events is to group related pictures together. One Event
might contain pictures you captured of a UFO, and a second Event might
hold pictures of your kid’s Little League game. After you’ve grouped related
pictures in an Event, you’ll be able to find what you need quickly and easily.
Creating an Event
When you import pictures, iPhoto automatically organizes them as Events,
based on the day the picture was captured. Organizing Events by day can
automatically sort pictures into one Event (the first day of your vacation when
you visited London) and a second Event (the second day of your vacation
when you visited Paris). 
You can also create an Event manually by choosing Events➪Create Events.
Browsing through an Event
An Event can represent a single picture, but it more likely represents several
pictures. To view all the pictures stored in a single Event, iPhoto lets you
browse through all the pictures just by moving the pointer from left to right
across the Event.
If you’d rather see all the pictures stored in a single Event at once, double-
click the Event to display them, as shown in Figure 1-2. 

Organizing Events in the Library
376
Naming an Event
To make finding pictures easier, you can give all Events a descriptive name
so you’ll have a rough idea what type of pictures are stored in that Event
without having to browse through them first. To give your Events a descriptive
name, follow these steps:
1. Click the Events category under Library in the left pane of the iPhoto
window.
The iPhoto window displays all your Events in the right pane. If you
haven’t named your Events, each Event may display the date when you
captured those pictures as its name.
2. Click the Event name, which appears directly under the Event picture. 
A yellow box highlights the Event. A text box appears along with the
number of pictures stored in that Event, as shown in Figure 1-3.
3. Type a new, descriptive name for your Event and press Return.

Merging Events
You might have pictures stored as separate Events, but you might later decide
that the pictures in both Events really should be grouped together in a single
Event. In this case, you can merge two Events into a single Event by following
these steps:
1. Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
The iPhoto window displays all your Events in the right pane.
2. Move the pointer over an Event you want to move or merge into
another Event.
3. Click and drag the Event over the Event you want to merge it with. 
The pointer turns into an arrow with a green plus sign, as shown in
Figure 1-4.
4. Release the left mouse button when the pointer appears over an Event. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you want to merge the two Events.
5. Click Merge. 
Your two Events now appear as a single Event.

Splitting an Event
Sometimes an Event might contain too many pictures. In this case, you might
want to store pictures in separate Events. To split an Event, follow these steps:
1. Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
The iPhoto window displays all your Events in the right pane.
2. Double-click an Event you want to split. 
The pictures in your Event appear in the iPhoto window (refer to Figure
1-2). 
3. Hold down the Ô key and click each picture you want to split into a
separate Event. 
A yellow border highlights each chosen picture.
4. Choose Events➪Split Event. 
Your chosen pictures now appear in a separate Event.
5. Click the All Events button. 
Your original and newly split Events appear highlighted with a yellow
border.

Moving pictures from one Event to another
If a picture appears in one Event but you think it should appear in a different
Event, you can always move that picture. To move a picture from one Event
to another, follow these steps:
1. Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
The iPhoto window displays all your Events in the right pane.
2. Click the Event that contains the picture you want to move.
3. Hold down the Ô key and click the second Event to which you want to
move a picture. 
Yellow borders appear around both Events.
4. Double-click one of the highlighted Events. 
The iPhoto window splits in half, with pictures of the two Events stacked
on top of each other in the two halves, as shown in Figure 1-5.
5. Click and drag the picture you want to move over the area containing
the pictures of the second Event.
6. Release the mouse button. 
Your chosen picture now appears in the other Event.
7. Click the All Events button to see all your Events again.

Sorting Events
The more Events you create to store your pictures, the harder it can get to
find what you need. To help keep you organized, iPhoto lets you sort your
Events by different criteria:
✦Date: Lets you sort Events by time.
✦Title: Lets you sort Events by title.
✦Manually: Lets you sort Events by clicking and dragging them.
You can also sort pictures by rating and keywords, but you must first give a
picture a rating or keyword, which you find out about later in this chapter.
Sorting by date or title
Sorting by date makes it easy to find pictures based on the time you remember
capturing those pictures. Sorting by title is helpful after you’ve given all Events
a descriptive title and want to find a picture stored under a specific Event title.
To sort Events by date or title within the iPhoto window, follow these steps: 
1. Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
The iPhoto window displays all your Events in the right pane.
2. Choose View➪Sort Events. 
A submenu appears with a check mark next to the current way you have
your Events sorted, as shown in Figure 1-6.
3. Choose By Date, By Title, Ascending, or Descending. 
Your Events now appear resorted by the criteria you chose.
If you choose Ascending or Descending, iPhoto resorts your Events based on
the sorting method that appears with a check mark in the Sort Events submenu.
Figure 1-6:

Sorting manually
Another way to sort Events is by clicking and dragging them around within
the iPhoto window. This gives you the freedom to arrange pictures in Events
based on your own preferences, regardless of date or titles. For example,
you might put all your family Events near the top of the iPhoto window to
make it easy to find pictures of different family members if you’re putting
together a newsletter for a family reunion.
To sort Events manually within the iPhoto window, follow these steps: 
1. Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
The iPhoto window displays all your Events in the right pane.
2. Click and drag an Event you want to move to its new location.
When you move an Event between two other Events, the other Events
slide out of the way to make room.
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new position of
the Event.
Organizing Pictures
After you’ve stored pictures in separate Events, you might want to view and
organize individual pictures stored in an Event. 
Viewing pictures stored in a single Event
If you want to view pictures in only one Event, follow these steps:
1. Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
The iPhoto window displays all your Events in the right pane.
2. Double-click an Event. 
All your pictures in that Event appear in the iPhoto window, as shown in
Figure 1-7.
3. Click the All Events button in the upper-left corner of the iPhoto
window to view all your Events again.

Organizing Pictures
382
Viewing pictures stored in all Events
Rather than view pictures stored in a single Event, you might want to view
all your pictures in separate Events at the same time. To view pictures in all
Events, follow these steps:
1. Click the Photos category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
The iPhoto window displays all your pictures. If you have hidden any
photos temporarily from view (by choosing Photos➪Hide Photos), you
can view those hidden photos by choosing View➪Hidden Photos and
making sure a check mark appears to the left of Hidden Photos.
2. Choose View➪Event Titles so a check mark appears to the left of Event
Titles. 
Note: If a check mark already appears to the left of Event Titles, skip this
step.
Displaying Event Titles lets you see how your pictures are organized into
different Events, as shown in Figure 1-8. 
3. Click the triangle to the left of the Event title to display or hide
pictures in an Event.
This step works only if a check mark appears to the left of Event Titles
on the View menu.

Naming pictures
Every digital camera stores pictures with generic filenames like DSC_846.
Fortunately, you can replace these generic titles with more descriptive names.
In iPhoto, you can give descriptive names to your Events and descriptive
names to individual pictures as well. So an Event might be named “Spring
Break,” and pictures stored in that Event might be named “Day 1: Partying,”
“Day 2: Drinking,” and “Day 3: Hangover.”
To name individual pictures stored in an Event, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”)
to view individual pictures.
2. Choose View➪Titles. 
Note: If a check mark already appears to the left of Titles, skip this step.
Titles appear underneath every picture. 
3. Click the title that you want to change. 
A text box appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.

4. Type a new name for your picture or use the arrow and Delete keys to
edit the existing name.
5. Press Return when you’re done.
After you’ve named all pictures in an Event, you can sort them by choosing
View➪Sort Photos➪By Title. Then you can choose View➪Sort Photos➪
Ascending (or Descending) to sort by titles in ascending or descending order.
Rating pictures
Some pictures are better than others, so another way to sort and organize
pictures is by rating them from zero to five stars. To rate pictures, follow
these steps:
1. Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”)
to view individual pictures.
2. Choose View➪Rating. 
Note: If a check mark already appears to the left of Rating, skip this step.
Titles appear underneath every picture. 
3. Click a picture to rate and choose Photos➪My Rating. 
A submenu of stars appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.

One fast way to rate pictures is to right-click a picture and choose the My
Rating submenu to pick a star rating. A second way is to click on a picture
and press Ô-0 through Ô-5 to rate a picture from zero to five stars.
After you’ve rated all pictures in an Event, you can sort them by choosing
View➪Sort Photos➪By Rating. To change whether to sort by ascending or
descending rating, choose View➪Sort Photos➪Ascending (or Descending). 
Adding keywords to a picture
A keyword helps you organize pictures based on categories such as Favorite,
Birthday, or Kids. By placing keywords on pictures, you can quickly find 
all Birthday or Kids pictures.
To add a keyword to a picture, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”)
to view individual pictures.
2. Click a picture that you want to label with a keyword.
If you hold down the Ô key, you can click two or more pictures to assign
the same keyword to all of them. 
3. Choose Window➪Show Keywords. 
A Keywords window appears, which displays several common keywords
that iPhoto has already provided for you, as shown in Figure 1-11. 
To add your own keywords to the Keywords window, click Edit Keywords.
When an Edit Keywords dialog appears, click the plus sign button to type
your own keywords into the Keywords window. (You can also click a key-
word and then click the minus sign button to remove a keyword from the
Keyword window.) If you click the Shortcut button, you can assign a key
Figure 1-10:
You can rate
each picture
with zero to
five stars. 

Organizing Pictures

to represent a keyword. That way you can choose View➪Keywords to
display a keywords text box underneath each picture, click in that text
box, and press your shortcut key to add a keyword to that picture quickly.
4. Click a keyword. 
Your chosen keyword appears underneath the picture you selected.
If you click the same keyword in the keyword window, iPhoto removes
the keyword from your chosen picture.
After you’ve added keywords to pictures in an Event, you can sort them by
choosing View➪Sort Photos➪By Keyword. Then you can sort alphabetically
by keyword by choosing View➪Sort Photos➪Ascending (or Descending). 
Storing pictures in albums and folders
Sorting and organizing pictures into Events can get cumbersome. For example,
you might have dozens of birthday pictures stored in separate Events. Although
you can store all these birthday pictures in the same Event, you might also
want to keep them grouped with other pictures in separate Events that
represent different years.
To keep pictures stored in separate Events while also grouping them together
at the same time, you can create an album. An album groups related pictures
together without removing them from the Events they’re currently stored in. 
Creating albums and organizing pictures manually
To create an album and store pictures in it, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Album.
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Figure 1-11:
The
Keywords
window
displays a

For another way to create an album, click the plus sign button in the
bottom-left corner of the iPhoto window. When a dialog pops up, click
the Album button, type a name for your album, and click Create.
2. Type a descriptive name for your album and click Create. 
Your album name appears under the Albums category in the iPhoto sidebar.
3. Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”)
to view individual pictures.
4. Click and drag a picture you want to add to your album onto the
album folder in the iPhoto sidebar.
You can select multiple pictures by holding down the Ô key and clicking
each picture you want to add to an album.
5. Release the mouse button to copy your picture to the album. 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each additional picture you want to copy into
the album.
Now, if you click the album name in the iPhoto sidebar, you can see all
the pictures in that album.
Any changes you make to a picture stored in an album automatically
appears in the same picture stored in an Event (and vice versa). 
The preceding steps create an empty album which you can then fill up with
pictures. If you want to select pictures to store in an album first, follow these
steps:
1. Select one or more pictures that you want to store in an album. 
2. Choose File➪New Album From Selection. 
A dialog appears, asking for a name for your Album.
3. Type a descriptive name for your album and click Create. 
Figure 1-12:
A dialog

Creating albums and organizing pictures automatically
In case manually dragging pictures in and out of albums is too troublesome,
you can set up a Smart Album from within iPhoto that will store pictures
automatically. 
To create a Smart Album that can store pictures automatically, follow these
steps:
1. Choose File➪New Smart Album. 
A dialog appears, asking for a name for your Smart Album.
2. Type a descriptive name for your album in the Smart Album Name
text box.
3. Click in the first pop-up menu and choose a criterion, such as
Keyword or Rating, as shown in Figure 1-13.
4. Click in the second and third pop-up menus to define the criterion you
chose in Step 3, such as choosing only pictures with a rating of four
stars or with the Birthday keyword.
5. (Optional) Click the plus sign button to define another criterion and
repeat Steps 3 and 4. 
6. Click OK. 
Your Smart Album now stores pictures based on your chosen criteria.
If you create too many albums, you can organize them into folders by choosing
File➪New Folder and dragging each album into that folder.

Deleting pictures, albums, and folders
Many times you’ll import pictures into iPhoto and decide that the picture isn’t
worth saving after all. To keep your iPhoto Library from getting too cluttered,
you should delete the pictures you don’t need.
Besides deleting individual pictures, you can also delete albums and folders
that contain pictures you don’t want. When you delete an album or folder
(which contains albums), you don’t physically delete any pictures; you just
delete the folder or album that contains the pictures. The original pictures
are still stored in the iPhoto Library.
To delete a picture, album, or folder, follow these steps:
1. Click and drag the picture, album, or folder you want to delete onto
the Trash icon in the iPhoto sidebar. 
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete your selected
items.
2. Click Delete.
Press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo Delete if you want to recover your deleted
items right away.
Editing Pictures
Besides organizing your pictures, iPhoto lets you edit them as well. Such
editing can be as simple as rotating or cropping a picture, or it can be as
complicated as removing red-eye from a photograph or modifying colors.
If you need more detailed or sophisticated editing, get a program like Adobe
Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com). 
Rotating a picture
Sometimes pictures appear sideways when you first import them into
iPhoto. To rotate a picture so you can see it right-side up, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”)
to view individual pictures.
2. Click a picture.
Editing buttons (including the Rotate button) appear at the bottom of
the iPhoto window, as shown in Figure 1-14.

 Adding transitions and effects
 Saving videos
I
f you have a digital video camcorder, you can create home movies. To make
your home movies fancier and more professional-looking, though, use
iMovie. That way, you can turn your home movies into a polished product that
you can upload to video-sharing sites such as YouTube, play on video iPods, or
just view on your Mac. Any digital home movie you might have, iMovie can
improve it with the help of your skill and creativity.
How iMovie Works
The iMovie program consists of an Event Library and a Project Library. The
Event Library appears in the bottom-left corner of the iMovie window and is
where you store videos. When you want to work your magic and come up
with a film project, you’ll pick and choose parts of any video you have stored
in the Event Library, and you’ll copy these parts (know as clips) into the
Project Library, which appears in the upper-left corner of the iMovie window.
The Event Library contains your raw, unedited video, whereas the Project
Library contains the copies of your video that you can modify. If you acci-
dentally erase or mess up a video in the Project Library, you can just retrieve
the original footage from the Event Library and start all over again.
Organizing the Event Library
The more videos you store, the more crowded the Event Library will get,
and the harder it will be to find what you want. When you store a new video
in the Event Library, iMovie gives you the option of creating an event folder,
which identifies the date you imported the video file into iMovie.

How iMovie Works
402
Organizing videos in the Event Library by date can be helpful, but you might
prefer identifying Events by descriptive name instead. To rename an Event,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
The Finder appears.
2. Double-click the iMovie icon in the Applications folder.
The iMovie window appears.
3. (Optional) Choose Window➪Event Library if the Event Library is not
visible.
4. Double-click an Event in the Event Library in the bottom-left corner of
the iMovie window.
Your chosen Event name appears highlighted.
5. Type a descriptive name or press the arrow and Delete keys to edit
the existing Event name. 
Storing video in different Event folders can help you find the video you want.
If you want to edit video of your family vacation, just click the Event folder
for that day or span of days to display your video. 
The Event Library displays each video file as a series of thumbnail images.
To define how to divide a video into multiple thumbnail images, drag the
slider in the bottom-right corner of the iMovie window. Dragging this slider
to the left divides your video into more thumbnail images, whereas dragging
this slider to the right divides your video into fewer thumbnail images.
Instead of forcing you to browse through your entire video to find the one
part you need, iMovie lets you jump straight to a scene that contains the
footage you want to use. After you’ve found the video footage that you want
to edit, just copy that video footage into the Project Library by dragging it
with the mouse.
Organizing the Project Library
The Project Library appears in the upper-left corner of the iMovie window.
You can divide the Project Library into different folders where one folder might
contain your family vacation video, and a second folder might contain the
footage you captured of a UFO you spotted hovering outside of New Mexico. To
view (or hide) the Project Library, choose Window➪Project Library.
You can copy and store the same video footage in two or more projects. 
In the Project Library, you can rearrange, trim, and delete video clips to
create your movie. This is where you can also add titles or sound effects to
your edited video. 

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using iMovie
Importing a Video into the Event Library
403
The basic steps for using iMovie are
✦Store and organize video in the Event Library. 
✦Copy video footage out of the Event Library and store it in a folder (project)
inside the Project Library.
✦Edit your video clips in the Project Library.
✦Save your video as a digital video file for viewing on other computers, on
DVD, or over the Internet.
Importing a Video into the Event Library
The Event Library holds all your videos, acting as your personal stock film
vault. By storing videos in the Event Library, you can selectively pick and
choose footage from old videos to use in any new projects. 
To store video in the Event Library, you must import a video from one of
three sources:
✦A digital video camera
✦A project created and saved using an earlier version of iMovie
✦A digital video file stored on your hard drive
Importing from a digital video camera
To import (that is, to copy) a movie that you’ve captured with a digital video
camera, follow these steps:
1. Connect your digital video camera to your Mac through a USB or
FireWire cable, as appropriate for your camcorder.
2. Double-click the iMovie icon inside the Applications folder to load
iMovie. 
The iMovie window appears.
3. Choose File➪Import from Camera. 
An Import window appears.
4. Click Import. 
An Import dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.

Importing a Video into the Event Library
404
5. Select one of the following radio buttons:
• Add to Existing Event: Stores the video as part of an existing event in
the Event library.
• Create New Event: Stores the video as a new event in the Event
library. The default name for the Event will be the current date, but
you can always type a more descriptive name.
6. Select or deselect the Split Days into New Events check box.
Many video camcorders time-stamp any video footage you capture, so
this option divides a video into parts where each part represents all
video footage shot on the same day.
7. Click OK. 
The Import dialog displays your video in real time.
8. Click Stop when you want to stop importing video. 
Your imported video appears as thumbnail images in the lower pane
(the Event pane) of the iMovie window, as shown in Figure 2-2. After you
import a video, your original video footage remains on your video cam-
corder, so you might want to go back and erase it.
You can define how many thumbnails to divide a video by dragging the slider
in the bottom-right corner of the iMovie window.
iMovie divides a video into separate scenes where each scene displays the
first frame of a video clip. By browsing through these thumbnail images of
scenes, you can see which scene is likely to contain the video footage you
want to use. 
Figure 2-1:
The Import
dialog lets
you define

Importing a digital video file
If you have any digital video files stored in QuickTime, MPEG-4, or digital
video (DV) files lying around on your hard drive, you can import them into
iMovie. To import a digital video file, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import Movies. 
An Open dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-3. You might need to navi-
gate through different drives and folders to find the file you want to import.
2. Select the digital video file you want to import.
3. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose a drive to store your video.
4. Select one of the following radio buttons:
• Add to Existing Event: Stores the video as part of an existing event in
the Even Library
• Create New Event: Stores the video as a new event in the iMovie
Event Library.
5. Choose how you want to handle importing 1080i video from the
Import 1080i Video As pop-up menu.
The Large option reduces the frame size of the video to 960 x 540 pixels,
whereas the Full option displays the frame size at the complete 1,920 x
1,080 pixels.

file to store in iMovie. The Move Files option physically transfers your
chosen video file and moves it into iMovie. 
7. Click Import.
Your imported movie appears as thumbnail images in the iMovie
window.
Working with Projects
The Project Library contains folders for storing your separate video projects.
One project might contain your family vacation movies, and a second project
might contain movies of your daughter’s soccer games. Projects contain one
or more video clips from movies stored in the Event Library. 
Creating an iMovie project
To create a project, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Project. 
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.
2. Enter a descriptive name for your project in the Project Name text box.

Selecting video clips
Whether you want to create a new project or edit an existing one, you need
to add video clips from the Event Library and place them in a folder stored
in the Project Library.
Before you can select a video clip to store in a project, you need to see exactly
what part of a video you want to clip. To help you find any part of a video,
iMovie displays an entire video as a series of images that appear like individual
frames of a filmstrip. To find a specific part of a video, you can skim through a
video. When you find the part of a video you want to use, just copy it and paste
it into a project folder.
Skimming a video
Skimming a video lets you see the contents of a video file just by moving the
mouse over the video images. To view a video by skimming, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over any one of the thumbnail images of a video file
when displayed in the Event Library section of the iMovie window. 
A red vertical line appears over the thumbnail image, as shown in Figure 2-6.

2. Move the mouse left and right to watch your video in the upper-right
corner of the iMovie window. 
The faster you move the mouse, the faster the video plays. Moving the
mouse to the left plays the video backwards. Moving the mouse to the
right plays the video forwards.
Selecting a video clip
After you see the part of a video you want to use, you need to select that
video clip by following these steps:
1. In the Event Library section of the iMovie window, move the pointer
to the beginning of the part of the video that you want to use.
2. Click and drag to the right.
A yellow rectangle appears to define the size of your clip, as shown in
Figure 2-7. You can drag the handles to define the exact frame to start
and end your video clip.
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the portion of the
video that your clip contains.

Placing a video clip in a project
After selecting a video clip, you can place it in a project folder. Video clips in
a project folder appear as thumbnail images so you can browse through
your collection of video clips. To place a video clip in a project folder, follow
these steps:
1. Make sure you have defined a video clip within a yellow rectangle, as
described in the preceding section.
2. Click a project folder displayed in the Project Library listing in the
upper-left corner of the iMovie window. 
Thumbnail images of any video clips already stored in the project
appear. 
Note: If you haven’t added any video clips to a project, you see a Drag
Media Here to Create a New Project message, along with three dotted
rectangles (refer to Figure 2-5).
3. Move the pointer inside the yellow rectangle of the video clip you
selected. 
The pointer turns into a hand icon.
4. Click and drag the selected video clip onto the project folder; then
release the mouse button (see Figure 2-8).
Your selected video clip appears as a thumbnail image in the Project
Library section of the iMovie window.
Deleting video clips
In case you store a video clip in a project folder and then decide you don’t
need that video clip any more, you can delete it from that project.
Deleting a video clip from a project does not delete the video clip from the
Event Library.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using iMovie
Working with Projects

Deleting a project
In case you’re done with a project or decide you no don’t want it anymore,
you can delete an entire project folder. 
When you delete a project folder, you also delete any video clips stored
inside that project. However, the original videos (from which you copied
clips to store in the Project Library) remain in the Event Library.
To delete a project, follow these steps:
1. Click the project folder you want to delete in the Project Library listing
on left-hand side of the iMovie window.

or choosing Edit➪Undo Delete Project.
Printing a project
Each project folder displays thumbnail images of one or more video clips. If
you want to review the order and images of the video clips stored in a proj-
ect, you can print these images on paper. Obviously, this printout of your
project thumbnails can’t show you the moving images of your video, but
they can show you the organization of your video clips.
To print the thumbnail images of video clips stored in a project folder, follow
these steps:
1. Click a project folder in the Project Library listing.
2. Choose File➪Print Project. 
A Print dialog appears.
3. (Optional) Drag the slider, in the bottom-right corner of the iMovie
window, to define how many thumbnail images to display. 
If you drag the slider to the right, you’ll display fewer thumbnail images.
Drag the slider to the left, and you’ll display more thumbnail images.
4. Click the Preview button to see how your project will appear on
paper, as shown in Figure 2-9.
5. Click Print.
Editing Video Clips in a Project
After you’ve placed one or more video clips in a project folder, you’ll usually
want to edit those video clips to put them in the best order, trim unneces-
sary footage, and add titles and audio to spice up your entire video. 
Rearranging the order of video clips 
A project plays video clips in sequence, but you might want to change the
order that your video clips play. To rearrange the order of your video clips in
a project, follow these steps:
1. Click a project folder in the Project Library listing. 
Thumbnail images of all your video clips appear in the center pane (the
project window) of the iMovie window.
2. Click a video clip you want to move.

on an iPod or iPhone, or even on YouTube. You can even save the same video
project to different formats in case you need to view your video on your Mac
but also want to post a copy on YouTube for other people to enjoy.

 Burning a DVD from a video camcorder
 Creating a DVD with the Magic iDVD option
 Working with iDVD projects
I
f you simply wanted to share digital photographs and movies with others,
you could burn your pictures and movies as separate files onto a DVD.
Friends and family could see your pictures or movies, but they’d have to
search through the DVD’s directory structure to find each individual file.
Although this method works, it makes looking at pictures and movies about
as tedious as browsing a hard drive, looking for word processor or spread-
sheet documents. 
To make DVDs useful for both storing and presenting digital pictures and
movies, use the iDVD program. iDVD lets you create photo slideshows or
movies complete with menus and graphics that can play on any DVD player.
If you ever dreamed of creating your own Hollywood-style DVDs to present
your home movies or digital photographs, iDVD will help you achieve your
dreams.
To create a DVD, iDVD gives you three choices:
✦OneStep DVD: Transfers a video directly from a digital video camcorder
to a DVD. 
✦Magic iDVD: Provides a variety of DVD templates that you can modify
for creating menus to organize the content of digital photographs and
movies stored on the DVD.
✦A DVD project: Lets you create custom DVD menus and graphics for
storing and presenting digital photographs and movies. 
To burn DVDs using iDVD, you need a Mac that can write to DVDs. If your
Mac can’t write to DVDs, you can still create an iDVD project, but you’ll have
to transfer it to another Mac to create your DVD.
Burning a Video Straight to DVD
The OneStep DVD option lets you burn a video from your video camcorder
and store it to a recordable DVD in your Mac. When you insert your finished

Burning a Video Straight to DVD
426
DVD into a DVD player, your video simply starts playing immediately, with
no fancy DVD menus or graphics. 
Although the OneStep DVD option creates the illusion of burning video from
a camcorder direct to a DVD, it’s actually encoding your video to an MPEG-2
video file format and creating various files on your hard disk before it burns
these files to a DVD. 
To burn a video to a DVD with the OneStep DVD option, follow these steps:
1. Load iDVD. (Click on the iDVD icon on the Dock or double-click on the
iDVD icon in the Applications folder to load iDVD.)
The iDVD opening window appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
2. Click the OneStep DVD button. 
A dialog appears, telling you to connect your video camcorder to your
Mac and insert a recordable DVD. 
3. Connect your video camcorder to your Mac using a FireWire cable.
4. Insert a recordable DVD in your Mac.
5. Click OK. 
A dialog appears to let you know when the DVD has finished burning. 
6. Click Done.
The DVD remains in your Mac so you can either view it using the DVD
Player or eject it yourself.

4. (Optional) Click on the Themes pop-up menu and choose a category of
themes, such as 7.0 Themes or 6.0 Themes.
The Themes pop-up menu provides themes used by different versions of
iDVD. So, if you wanted to use themes used by version 6.0 of iDVD,
choose 6.0 Themes. (The current version of iDVD is 7.0.)
5. Choose a theme, such as Vintage Vinyl or Sunflower, from the Themes
browser.
Each theme offers a different appearance for your DVD menus. Each theme
name describes its appearance, so Sunflower displays a big sunflower while
Vintage Vinyl displays an old turntable and vinyl record.

7. Click and drag a movie that you want to add to your DVD onto the
Drop Movies Here drop well. 
To select multiple movies, hold down the Ô key and click each movie
you want to add to your DVD.
If you click a movie and click the Play button, you can see a thumbnail
image of your movie.

9. Click and drag a picture that you want to add to your DVD onto the
Drop Photos Here drop well. 
To select multiple pictures, hold down the Ô key and click each picture
you want to add to your DVD. 
Each drop well represents a separate slideshow. Generally, you’ll want to
put several pictures in the same drop well to create a slideshow of multi-
ple pictures. Underneath each drop well, iDVD lists the number of slides
currently stored, such as “2 slides.”
10. In the right pane of the Magic iDVD window, click the Audio tab. 
A list of audio files stored in iTunes and GarageBand appears.
11. Click and drag an audio file that you want to play during a photo
slideshow onto the Drop Photos Here drop well. 
Pictures that include audio appear with an audio icon over them, as
shown in Figure 3-3. 
Keep in mind that, if you add a 3-minute audio file over a slideshow (drop
well) that contains 3 slides, each slide will appear for 1 minute until the
entire audio file finishes playing. If you add a 3-minute audio file to a
slideshow of 30 slides, each slide will appear for 0.1 minutes. So the more
slides (pictures) you add, the faster the images pop up and disappear
while an audio file plays.
12. Click the Preview button in the lower-left corner. 
An iDVD Preview window appears with a controller (which mimics a
typical handheld remote control) so you can take your DVD through its
paces to make sure it works the way you want, as shown in Figure 3-4.

Working with iDVD Projects
For maximum flexibility, you can design your own DVD menus and add graphics
to give your DVD a polished, professional look. When you create your own
DVD project, you can save it and edit it later. 
The different parts of an iDVD project are
✦Title menu: Displays a list of the different contents of the DVD, such as
movies or slideshows.
✦Slideshows: Displays a slideshow of multiple digital photographs.
✦Movies: Displays a movie.
✦Text: Displays text on-screen — useful for providing instructions or
descriptions about the DVD.
✦Submenus: Displays another screen where you can offer additional
slideshows or movies.
✦Opening content: Displays a photo or movie that appears as soon as
someone inserts the DVD into their DVD player. In many commercial
DVDs, the opening content is usually an FBI warning about copyright
infringement.
Not every iDVD project uses all of the preceding parts. At the very least, an
iDVD project needs a title menu and at least one slideshow or movie. 
To create a DVD project, follow these steps:
1. Load iDVD.

Saving your iDVD project
After you’re finished designing your DVD project, you can save your entire
project in one of three ways:
✦As a DVD
✦As a disc image (.img) file
✦As files stored in a VIDEO_TS folder
Burning to a DVD
When you save your iDVD project to a DVD, you create a DVD that you can
give to anyone to play on any DVD player. To burn an iDVD project to a DVD,
follow these steps:
1. Insert a blank DVD into your Mac.
2. Choose File➪Burn DVD. 
Saving to a disc image
As an alternative to saving an iDVD project to a DVD, you can also save an
iDVD project to a disc image. A disc image is a single file that contains the
entire contents of a drive or folder. By storing an iDVD project as a disc
image, you can transfer a single (large) file to someone over the Internet.
Then that person can open that disc image to retrieve the entire contents of
your iDVD project and burn the disc image contents to a DVD. 
To save your iDVD project to a disc image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save as Disc Image. 
A Save Disc Image As dialog appears.
2. Type a descriptive name for your disc image in the Save As text box. 
3. Choose a location to store your disc image from the Where pop-up
menu. 
4. Click Save.
Saving to a VIDEO_TS folder
You can also save your entire iDVD project inside a VIDEO_TS folder, which
essentially lets you store the contents of your iDVD project as separate files
stored in a folder. By storing a DVD in a folder, you can play your DVD
directly off the hard drive. 
To save your iDVD project to a folder, follow these steps:

1. Choose File➪Save as VIDEO_TS Folder. 
A Save VIDEO_TS Folder As dialog appears.
2. Type a descriptive name for your folder in the Save As text box.

4. Click Save.
When you save an iDVD project as a VIDEO_TS folder, you can open and play
the contents of that VIDEO_TS folder by using the DVD Player program in the
Applications folder of any Mac. If you later decide to burn the contents of a
VIDEO_TS folder to a DVD, make sure you burn the DVD in UDF format to
create a DVD that can play in other DVD players.

Chapter 4: Creating Web Sites 
with iWeb
In This Chapter
 Understanding the parts of a Web page
 Creating Web sites
 Designing Web pages
 Publishing Web pages
A
lmost everyone has a Web site these days. Some people use Web sites
to publicize their businesses, and others use Web sites as their sole
means of reaching customers, such as online sellers of books, food, or pet
products. Some people run Web sites focusing on their favorite hobbies, such
as gardening or Star Trek trivia. No matter what your interests and needs,
setting up a Web site can be fun, rewarding, and perhaps profitable as well. 
Although creating Web pages isn’t difficult, it’s not as straightforward as you
might hope. That’s why Apple created iWeb, a special program designed to
make creating Web pages easy, fun, and fast. With iWeb, you can create 
professional-looking Web pages in minutes instead of days. 
When creating Web pages, make sure the information you put on those Web
pages is something that won’t embarrass you later. 
The Parts of a Web Page
Think of a Web page as an endless sheet of paper that you can stretch in all
directions to make it as large or as small as you want. On this sheet, you can
paste text, pictures, graphics, movies, songs, and even programs for others
to access. To help guide people around your Web pages, you also need to add
navigational aids called hyperlinks, also commonly called links. By clicking a
link, people can jump from one Web page to another or from one location on a
page to another location on that same Web page. Figure 4-1 shows the typical
parts of a Web page.

The Parts of a Web Page
444
The purpose of text
Text generally serves two purposes. First, text provides content on a Web
page, such as a news story or a step-by-step description for how to bake a
cake. Second, text is often used to create hyperlinks to other Web pages or
to entirely different Web sites altogether. 
To make text easy to find and read, you can add color, change the fonts and
font size, or display text in different styles such as bold and italics. Some
Web pages might contain lots of text (such as a news site like CNN (www.cnn.
com), whereas others might contain a minimal amount of text, such as a Web
site displaying photographs with text simply listing the photograph’s name
or topic.
The purpose of graphics
Graphics can serve a purely decorative function, such as a company logo
displayed in the corner of the Web page. Besides decorative purposes,
graphics can also be used as content and as hyperlinks.

Figure 4-1:

Book IV
Chapter 4
Creating Web Sites 
with iWeb
Creating a Web Site in iWeb
445
As content, graphics provide information, such as photographs on a news
site or pictures of your family on a personal site. Instead of showing pictures,
some graphics can display decorative text in ways that ordinary text cannot
produce. For example, a Web site for a plant nursery might have its name
displayed in text or graphics. When displayed as text, the nursery’s name
might appear in a different font or bold. When displayed as a graphic image,
that same nursery’s name could appear in different fonts as well as having a
picture of a vine intertwined between the characters of the nursery’s name. 
It’s impossible to search for text stored as a graphic image. That’s why many
Web sites list an e-mail address as a graphic image; if they list that e-mail
address as text, another computer can scan the Web site for text that
contains an e-mail address to send junk e-mail.
Finally, graphics, like text, are often used to create hyperlinks, such as
menus that offer options for displaying different Web pages. Such graphic
hyperlinks often provide you with a more colorful way to present hyperlinks
than plain text, such as appearing as buttons or pull-down menus. 
Putting together a Web page
To create a Web page with other programs, you have to learn the cryptic
language that creates Web pages, known as HTML (HyperText Markup
Language). Since learning the HTML language just to create a Web page might
be intimidating, iWeb simplifies this task by creating HTML code for you
“behind the scenes.” All you have to do is arrange objects (text and graphics)
on a Web page. 
Although you could create a Web page starting with a blank page, it’s far
easier to create a Web page by modifying a one that’s already been designed
for you. With iWeb, you can choose from a variety of predesigned Web page
templates, which already contain background graphics, text, and pictures
that you can customize. Such templates act like a library of term papers that
you can modify and pass off as your own. 
Creating a Web Site in iWeb
Every Web site contains one or more Web pages. To design a Web site, you
need to decide how many Web pages you need, the purpose for each Web
page, and the overall appearance you want to use for each Web page.
The number of Web pages you need can vary depending on the Web site’s
purpose If you’re putting together an online store to sell food, books, or pet
supplies, you might need dozens (or even hundreds) of separate Web pages
to list all your products. You can always add and delete Web pages as you
need them.

Creating a Web Site in iWeb
446
After you know (approximately) how many Web pages you’ll need and what
you want each Web page to offer, the next step is to pick a theme, which
defines the overall appearance of each Web page, such as a background
color or decorative graphic along the borders. 
Picking a theme
A theme provides a consistent appearance for every Web page that makes
up your Web site. One part of your Web site might list products for sale, so
you might use one theme for product listings. Another part of your Web site
might list company news so those Web pages might use a different theme.
Themes simply help visually organize similar information. 
To pick a theme for your Web pages, follow these steps:
1. Load iWeb. (Click the iWeb icon on the Dock or double-click the iWeb
icon in the Applications folder.)
2. Choose File➪New Site. 
A dialog appears, listing different themes in the Theme list on the left
and displaying the appearance of specific types of Web pages on the
right, as shown in Figure 4-2.
3. Click a theme in the Theme list. 
Each time you click a different theme, the Web pages in the right pane
show you how that new theme displays each type of Web page —
Welcome page, About Me page, Photos page, whatever.
If you click in the pop-up menu in the upper left corner of the iWeb dialog, you
can choose themes used with older versions of iWeb such as version 2.0, 1.1,
or 1.0.  
4. Click one of the following types of Web pages in the right pane:
• Welcome: Introduces your Web site. The Welcome page is typically
the first Web page visitors see when they visit a specific site such as
www.dummies.com.
• About Me: Describes yourself or your company.
• Photos: Displays digital pictures, such as those stored in iPhoto, for
everyone to see.
• My Albums: Displays groups of different photo categories for people
to browse.
• Movie: Displays a digital video that people can watch directly in your
Web page.

• Blog: Provides space for typing your thoughts about different topics.
• Podcast: Displays lists of audio recordings (podcasts) that others can
hear directly off your Web page.
• Blank: Provides a Web page that incorporates a specific theme so
you can add anything you want to it.
5. Click Choose. 
The Web page that appears in the iWeb window is all decked out in your
chosen theme, as shown in Figure 4-3. You may see pictures of strange
people and gibberish text. This is known as placeholder text and graphics,
which you’ll have to replace, as explained later in this chapter in the
“Designing a Web Page” section.
Adding new pages
Because Web sites typically contain more than one Web page, you often need
to add more Web pages to your Web site. To add a Web page, follow these
steps:
1. Choose File➪New Page (or press Ô+N). 
The list of available Web page templates appears again with your current
theme already highlighted (refer to Figure 4-2).

2. Select a new page you want to add, such as Podcast or My Albums,
and then click Choose. 
Your new Web page appears in the iWeb window.
Deleting Web pages
If you’ve added too many Web pages or suddenly find you don’t need a Web
page after all, you can delete that Web page. To delete a Web page, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Web page that you want to delete in the sidebar of the iWeb
window. 
2. Choose Edit➪Delete Page. 
Your chosen Web page disappears, along with any text or graphics you
stored on that Web page.
If you accidentally delete a Web page, press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo to
retrieve the deleted Web page.

Designing a Web Page
With the exception of the Blank Web page template, every iWeb template dis-
plays a Web page filled with placeholder text and graphic images that you
can then replace with your own text and pictures. 
Replacing placeholder text
Placeholder text is meant to give you a rough idea of what the text might
look like on the Web page. To change placeholder text, follow these steps: 
1. In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the Web page that you want
to modify. 
Your chosen Web page appears in the right pane of the iWeb window.
2. Double-click the text you want to edit or replace. 
Your chosen text appears highlighted.
3. Type new text or press the arrow and Delete keys to edit the existing
text. 
Instead of typing new text, you can always copy text from another program
and paste it over the placeholder text instead.
Replacing placeholder graphics
Placeholder graphics are meant to give you some idea how a picture would
work in a particular area of your page. To replace placeholder graphics with
some graphics of your own, follow these steps: 
1. In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the Web page you want to
modify. 
Your chosen Web page appears in the right pane of the iWeb window.
2. Click the Media button that appears at the bottom of the iWeb window.
A Media window appears.
3. Click the Photos button. 
Your iPhoto library appears in the Media Browser, as shown in Figure 4-4. 
4. Click and drag a picture you want to use onto the placeholder graphic
image you want to replace.
5. Release the mouse button. 
Your iPhoto picture now appears on your Web page.
6. Click the Close button of the Media window.

Changing the Web page theme
You might end up modifying a Web page with text and graphics and suddenly
realize that you don’t like the theme you chose after all. To change a Web
page’s theme while leaving your content (text and graphics you’ve added)
unchanged, follow these steps: 
1. In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the Web page you want to
modify. 
Your chosen Web page appears in the right pane of the iWeb window.
2. Click the Theme button that appears at the bottom-left corner of the
iWeb window. 
A pop-up menu of different themes appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.

Customizing the Parts of a Web Page
Making an iWeb template your own by replacing placeholder text and graph-
ics certainly makes creating Web pages easy, but sooner or later, you’ll come
across a template that doesn’t have the text and graphics positioned exactly
where you want them. To further customize a Web page, you need to know
how to add, move, resize, delete, and arrange text and graphics on a Web
page. You can modify existing objects or create new objects for storing text
and graphics.
Moving an object
To move text or graphics to another part of your Web page, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over the text or graphics you want to move.
2. Click and drag the text or graphics to a new location.
3. Release the mouse button.
The text or graphics stays put in its new location.

Resizing an object
To resize text or graphics to make it bigger or smaller, follow these steps:
1. Click to select the text or graphics you want to resize. 
Handles appear around your chosen object, as shown in Figure 4-6.
2. Move the pointer over a handle until the pointer turns into a two-way
pointing arrow; then click and drag the handle to change the size of
your object.
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of the
text or graphic object.

Rearranging an object
If you move or resize an object, it might cover up another object as shown in
Figure 4-7. To fix this problem, you might need to rearrange which object
appears over another one.
Think of each object (text or graphic) as a sheet of paper that can lie over or
slide under another object.
Figure 4-7:
Objects can

To rearrange which object appears on top of another one, follow these steps:
1. Click to select the text or graphics that you want to place over (or
under) another object. 
Handles appear around your selected object.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Arrange➪Bring Forward: Moves the selected object over one object
that might be overlapping it. If multiple objects cover your selected
object, you might not see any difference.
• Arrange➪Bring to Front: Moves the selected object on top of all over-
lapping objects.
• Arrange➪Send Backward: Moves the selected object underneath one
object that it may be covering.
• Arrange➪Send to Back: Moves the selected object underneath all
other overlapping objects. 
Deleting objects
To delete one or more objects, follow these steps:
1. Click to select the text or graphics that you want to delete. 
To select multiple objects, hold down the Shift key and click each object
you want to delete.
2. Press Delete or choose Edit➪Delete. 
If you delete an object by mistake, press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo.
Working with text
Text always appears on a Web page inside a text box, which you can move
and resize on a Web page. If you create a Web page from a template, it will
likely have a text box on the page that you can fill with your own text. If you
create a blank Web page, or need more room to display text, you may need
to create a text box. 
Creating a text box
To create a text box, follow these steps:
1. Click the Text Box icon at the bottom of the iWeb window or choose
Insert➪Text Box. 
A blinking cursor appears in the middle of your Web page. 
2. Type your text. 

Book IV
Chapter 4

If you have any existing objects on the Web page, the text box might
appear over an existing object. When you type, you might have a hard
time seeing your text, so press Ô+A to see your text.
3. Click anywhere on the Web page away from your newly created text box.
4. Click your newly created text box to display handles around your
newly created text box. 
5. Click and drag to move and/or resize the text box.

Working with graphics
You can add and place digital photographs, simple graphic shapes like arrows,
or even videos anywhere on a Web page. If you create a Web page from a tem-
plate, the template will likely provide placeholder graphics for you to add your
own pictures. However, if you want to add more pictures, or if you started with
a blank Web page, you can add more graphics to any Web page.
Graphics can take time to transfer over the Internet, so the more graphics
you place on a Web page — and the larger the graphic images you use — the
longer the Web page will take to load and display in someone’s Web browser.
Don’t be afraid to use graphics, but don’t go overboard either.
Adding a picture to a Web page
To add a picture to a Web page, follow these steps:
1. Click the Media button at the bottom of the iWeb window. 
The Media Browser appears.
2. Click the Photos tab. 
A list of pictures stored in iPhoto appears.
3. Click and drag a picture from the Media Browser onto your Web page.
4. Release the mouse button. 
Your chosen picture appears on your Web page. (You might need to
move or resize the picture.)
5. Click the Close button of the Media Browser.
The preceding steps let you add an iPhoto image to a Web page. However, if
you have a picture that isn’t stored in iPhoto, you can add that picture to a
Web page by choosing Insert➪Choose. When a dialog appears, navigate to
the graphic file you want, click to select it, and then click Insert.
Adding a movie to a Web page
Besides adding pictures, you can also add movies to a Web page, which
people can view when they visit your site. To add a movie to a Web page,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Media button at the bottom of the iWeb window. 
The Media Browser appears.
2. Click the Movies tab. 
A list of movies stored in your Movies folder appears in the Media
Browser.

Publishing Your Web Pages

3. Click and drag a movie from the Media Browser onto your Web page.
4. Release the mouse button. 
Your chosen movie appears on your Web page. (You may need to move
or resize the picture.)
5. Click the Play button to preview your movie.
6. Click the Close button of the Media Browser.
Publishing Your Web Pages
After you create all the Web pages that make up your Web site, you need to
publish your Web pages. If you have a .Mac account, you can choose one of
the following two options:
✦File➪Publish to .Mac: Sends the current Web page to your .Mac
account. Your Web page is now available for viewing.
✦File➪Publish All to .Mac: Sends all the Web pages of your Web site to
your .Mac account. Your entire Web site is now updated. 
The Publish to .Mac option is best if you’re updating a single Web page. The
Publish All to .Mac option is best when you’ve made massive changes to
your Web pages or if you’re posting your Web site for the first time. 
If you don’t have a .Mac account, you can choose the File➪Publish to a
Folder. This stores all your Web pages, plus any additional files such as pic-
tures and movies, in a folder that you define. After you’ve stored all your
Web pages to a folder, you need to use a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) pro-
gram to transfer all the files from this folder to your Web hosting service.
(See Book III, Chapter 5 for more information about setting up a Web site.)
A popular (and free) FTP program is Cyberduck (http://cyberduck.ch).

In This Chapter
 Playing instruments with Magic GarageBand
 Recording your music
 Recording your podcasts
 Saving your music
G
arageBand lets you record, play, alter, and arrange any types of sounds to
create your own music. If you already know how to play an instrument,
GarageBand provides accompanying instruments such as drums, keyboards,
and guitars that you can include in recordings of your own music. If you don’t
know how to play an instrument at all, GarageBand turns your Macintosh into
a full-fledged band where you can control the sound of each instrument,
arrange the separate audio tracks, and smash them together to create your
own hit songs. 
Although designed for recording, modifying, and playing music, GarageBand
can record, modify, and save any type of audio files. If you’re not interested
in making music, you can use GarageBand to clean up recorded speech and
save them as podcasts that you can distribute to the rest of the world. 
Whether you want to record and arrange music or recorded speech, the
three main tasks for using GarageBand are:
✦Recording audio
✦Arranging and modifying audio
✦Saving the finished audio file
Whatever your needs, GarageBand can satisfy your artistic side or serious
side, or just give you another way to amuse yourself with your Macintosh. 
Recording Audio
Since GarageBand works with audio, the first task is to record audio into
GarageBand using your computer’s built-in microphone, an external micro-
phone, or audio input (such as a keyboard or guitar plugged directly into
your Macintosh). 

Recording Audio
460
If you don’t have a real instrument, GarageBand provides a variety of software
instruments, which are basically different musical instruments such as pianos,
guitars, and drums that you can play and control through your Macintosh. All
you have to do is specify the notes and tempo to play and software instru-
ments let you hear your music played by different instruments. 
Apple sells additional Jam Packs, which provide additional software instru-
ments such as ethnic instruments, vocalists, or symphony orchestras. 
Recording audio through Magic GarageBand
Magic GarageBand is great for creating a certain type of background music
quickly and easily. For example, if you’re creating a Keynote presentation to
present to cowboys, you might want country music playing in the back-
ground. Rather than hunt up a country song, just fire up Magic GarageBand,
pick the Country musical genre, modify the song by choosing different
instruments, and you have yourself an instant country song without even
knowing how to play an instrument.
Each musical genre in Magic GarageBand only plays one stock song that you
can modify. If you want a country song, Magic GarageBand creates the same
country song. It’s up to you to customize this song to make it different if you
want. If you want to create your own country song, you’ll have to create a
new music project rather than use Magic GarageBand.
To create a Magic GarageBand, follow these steps:
1. Load GarageBand. 
A dialog appears as shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1:

8. Click the Play button to hear how the song or snippet sounds with
your new instruments.
Essentially, Magic GarageBand plays one stock song that you can modify
by choosing the types of instruments to play.

Creating music with software instruments
Magic GarageBand can be handy for creating an instant song from a specific
musical genre, but GarageBand also lets you specify the notes to play so
GarageBand’s software instruments can play your music instead.
Software instruments give you a chance to create music starting with one
instrumental track and gradually layering other tracks until you’ve defined the
parts for an entire band. To use software instruments, you need to specify the
instrument you want to use, such as a baby grand piano or a steel string
acoustic guitar. Then define the notes you want that instrument to play using a
virtual keyboard where you can click or press the notes you want to play.
To create a software instrument, follow these steps:
1. Load GarageBand. 
A dialog appears (refer to Figure 5-1). 
2. Click New Music Project. 
A New Project dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-5.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your project in the Save As text box. 
4. Choose a location for storing your project from the Where pop-up
menu.
5. (Optional) Change the Tempo, Time, bpm (beats per minute), and key
options.
You can always change these options later. 
6. Click Create. 
A window appears, displaying a virtual keyboard and a single audio
track for a Grand Piano, as shown in Figure 5-6.

Electric Piano).
9. Click on the virtual keyboard to hear how your chosen instrument
sounds. 
10. (Optional) Click the Musical Typing button on the virtual keyboard, or
choose Windows ‡ Musical Typing. 
A Musical Typing keyboard appears as shown in Figure 5-8. The Musical
Typing keyboard allows you to press keys on your Mac keyboard to play
certain notes, which you may find more convenient than using your
mouse to click keys on the virtual keyboard.
11. Click the Record button and click on the virtual keyboard or type on
the Musical Typing keyboard to record the notes as you play.
12. Click the Record button again to stop recording and click the
Play/Stop button.
13. Click the Go to Beginning button and click Play to hear the notes
you’ve recorded.

you can use this step to make your keyboard sound like horns, drums,
or guitars.
12. Click on the Input Source pop-up menu and choose the option for how
your instrument is connected to your Macintosh (such as through a
USB port or other type of connection).
13. Click the Monitor pop-up menu and choose On or Off to define if you

Modifying the key and tempo
You can move tracks and/or regions around in a GarageBand song to radically
change the way a song sounds, but you can also just change the key or tempo
to introduce a slight (or maybe even a major) change. Changing the key can
modify the way a song sounds while changing the tempo speeds up or slows
down a song without making the song sound high-pitched or like it’s 
running down.
To change the time, key, tempo, you use the LCD Mode, which mimics an
LCD (liquid crystal display) at the bottom of the GarageBand window. By
changing what the LCD Mode displays, you can modify items like the key and
tempo of your tracks.
To change both the key and tempo, follow these steps:
1. Choose Project from the LCD Mode pop-up menu near the bottom of
the GarageBand window, as shown in Figure 5-17. 
By choosing Project, the LCD Mode displays the current key and tempo
of your track.

song.
By playing your song, you can adjust the key and tempo and hear your
changes in real-time as they occur.

Recording Podcasts
Podcasts are recorded audio files that contain speech, such as interviews,
radio talk show broadcasts, or just monologues of a single person talking
about anything they want. If you store your podcast on a Web site, anyone in
the world can download and listen to your podcast.
To customize your podcasts, GarageBand lets you add other audio, picture,
or video files using the Media Browser, which appears in the upper right
corner of the GarageBand window. 
Recording speech
The most important part about a podcast is recording spoken words, either
through the internal microphone in your Macintosh, an external microphone
plugged into your Macintosh, or even a recording of an iChat audio conver-
sation using a program such as Conference Recorder (www.ecamm.com),
Audio Hijack (www.rogueamoeba.com), or WireTap Studio (http://www.
AmbrosiaSW.com). 
To record a podcast, follow these steps:
1. Load GarageBand. 
A dialog appears (refer to Figure 5-1).
2. Click Create New Podcast Episode. 
A New Project from Template dialog appears.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your podcast in the Save As text box.

The GarageBand window appears as shown Figure 5-20.
6. Click the Male or Female Voice track, click the Record button, and
start speaking. 
Choosing a Male or Female Voice track makes GarageBand optimize
recording for males or females. If you’ve already captured audio and
stored it in iTunes or GarageBand, click on the Audio button in the
Media Browser window, click on GarageBand or iTunes, and drag an
audio file on to the Male or Female Voice track.

Refer to the earlier section, “Editing Audio,” for instructions on editing your
podcast audio file.
Adding jingles and audio effects
After you’ve recorded you or someone else speaking, you may want to add
music or sound effects to enhance your podcast. For example, you could
have introductory music that fades away as soon as you start speaking. 
To prevent any background jingles or audio effects from drowning out the
spoken portion of your audio, GarageBand offers a feature called Ducking,
which mutes background music when the Male or Female Voice track starts
playing. To turn the Ducking feature on or off, choose Control➪Ducking.
To add audio effects, follow these steps:
1. Choose Control➪Show Loop Browser, or click the View/Hide the Loop
Browser button. 
The Loop Browser appears, as shown in Figure 5-21.
2. Click on an Effects category, such as Jingles or Sound Effects.

P
ages is a combination word processor and desktop publishing program.
As a word processor, Pages lets you type, edit, and format text quickly
and easily. As a desktop publisher, Pages lets you arrange graphics and text
boxes on a page to create business cards, menus, newsletters, or brochures. 
Because Pages offers a dual personality as a word processor and a desktop
publishing program, you can switch between the features you need in a
single program. You can start writing and then decide to design your pages.
Halfway through designing your pages, you might feel the urge to write again. 
Pages is part of the iWork suite — and it ain’t free. Your Mac may have a trial
version of Pages that lets you play with the program to see if it meets your
needs.
Working with Document Templates
To help you get started writing, Pages supplies a variety of document
templates. By choosing a document template, you can just enter new text 
or customize the appearance of the template so you don’t have to create
everything from scratch.
Pages offers two types of templates: Word Processing and Page Layout. Word
Processing templates are designed mostly for writing (relatively) plain and
simple, while Page Layout templates are designed mostly for when you’re
mixing text and graphics. (You can always add pictures to a Word Processing
template or write in a text box on a Page Layout template.)

Working with Document Templates
482
The main difference between Word Processing templates and Page Layout
templates is that you can type directly on a page in a document created from
a Word Processing template. If you want to type text on a document created
from a Page Layout template, you have to create a text box and place that
text box somewhere on your page.
A second difference is that you must manually add (or delete) pages in a
Page Layout template (by choosing the Insert➪Pages or Edit➪Delete Page
commands). With a Word Processing template, Pages automatically adds
pages as you type and deletes pages as you delete text. 
In general, if you need a document that contains mostly text, such as letters
or reports, start with a Word Processing template. If you need a document
that consists mostly of pictures, or if you need to create newsletters, magazine
pages, or Web pages, start with a Page Layout template. 
After you create a document using a Word Processing (or Page Layout) tem-
plate, you can’t switch to a new template. If you want to use a different 
template, you have to create another document. 
To choose a document template, follow these steps:
1. Load Pages by double-clicking the Pages icon in the Applications
folder (or choose File➪New if Pages is already running). 
A dialog appears, displaying different templates you can choose, as
shown in Figure 6-1.

2. Select a template category under the Word Processing or Page Layout
headings in the listing on the left.
The templates for your selected category appear in the main pane of the
dialog.
3. Click in the right pane to select a template and then click the Choose
button. 
Pages displays your chosen template. 
If you want to start out with a blank document, click on the Blank template
under the Word Processing category.
Replacing placeholder text
Nearly every template contains placeholder text that shows you gibberish
that you’ll have to replace with your own text. To change text in a template,
follow these steps:
1. Double-click the placeholder text you want to change.
Pages selects the entire placeholder text, which can be as short as a
single sentence or as large as several paragraphs, as shown in Figure 6-2.
2. Type any new text you want to replace the placeholder text.

Replacing placeholder pictures
Many templates display placeholder pictures. Unless you happen to like the
picture included with a template, you’ll probably want to replace it with one
of your own by following these steps:
1. Click the Media icon (the one displaying a musical note) on the toolbar,
or choose View➪Show Media Browser. 
The Media Browser window appears.
2. Click the Photos tab in the Media Browser window to view all the 
pictures stored in iPhoto.
3. Click and drag a picture from the Media Browser window onto any
placeholder picture in your document.
4. Release the mouse button. 
Pages replaces the placeholder picture with the picture you chose from
the Media Browser window, as shown in Figure 6-3.
5. Click the Close button on the Media Browser window.

Working with Text
485
Working with Text
Text can appear directly on a page or inside a text box. Word Processing
templates let you type text directly on a page, but you can always add text
boxes and type text inside those text boxes later. Page Layout templates
allow you to type text only inside text boxes.
You can always tell what type of template your document is based on by
peeking at the title bar of the document window, which identifies your 
document by name followed by either (Word Processing) or (Page Layout).
The advantage of typing text directly on a page is that you can keep typing
and Pages automatically creates new pages as you type. The disadvantage of
typing text directly on a page is that it’s harder to define exactly where the
text will appear on a page. 
The advantage of using text boxes is that you can move them anywhere on a
page. The disadvantage of typing text in a text box is that text boxes can
display only a limited amount of text. (If you need to type a large amount of
text, you may need to link text boxes together so when text overflows one
text box, it automatically flows into another one.)
Editing text
Whether you’re typing text directly on a page or inside a text box, you can
edit text by adding, deleting, or rearranging it. 
Adding text
Any new text you type appears wherever the cursor is located. To add text,
just place the cursor where you want the new text to appear, click, and then
type away. 
If a cursor immediately appears when you click, that means you’ve moved the
cursor inside text that appears directly on a page. If a box surrounds the text
that you clicked, that means you clicked inside a text box. In that case, you have
to move the pointer over the text inside the text box and click a second time.
Deleting text
You can delete text in two ways:
✦Move the cursor next to characters you want to erase. To delete characters
that appear to the left of the cursor, press the big Delete key (the one that
appears to the right of the +/= key). To delete characters that appear to the
right of the cursor, press the little Delete key (also called the Forward-
Delete key, which appears to the left of the End key). 

Working with Text
486
Not all keyboards have this Forward-Delete key. 
✦Select text and then press Delete.
You can select text by holding down the Shift key and moving the cursor
using the arrow keys, or you can drag the mouse over text to select it. 
Rearranging text
After you’ve written some text, you may need to rearrange it by copying or
moving chunks of text from one location to another. You can copy and move
text between two text boxes or from one part of a text page to another part
of the same page — or to another page all together.
To copy and move text, you can use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands on
the Edit menu, but you might find it quicker to select and drag text using the
mouse. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Select the text you want to copy or move.
If you want to copy text, hold down the Option key while doing Step 2. If
you want to move text, you don’t need to hold down any keys.
2. Click and drag the selected text, to a new location. 
3. Release the mouse button to finish copying or moving your text.
Formatting text
To make text look more appealing, you can format text to use different fonts,
display text in italics, change the size of text, or add color to text. To give
you fast access to different formatting options, Pages displays a Format Bar
near the top of the Pages window. To view (or hide) the Format Bar, choose
View➪Show (or Hide) Format Bar.
To format text, select the text you want to format and then do any of the
following:
✦Click the Font pop-up menu on the Format Bar as shown in Figure 6-4,
and then choose a font from the menu that appears.
✦Click the Style pop-up menu on the Format bar and choose a style such
as Regular or Heading 1. (Choosing Bold or Italic from the Style pop-up
menu is identical to clicking on the Bold or Italic icon on the Format Bar.)
✦Click the Font Size pop-up menu on the Format Bar and choose a size,
such as 12 or 24.

✦Click the Text Color button on the Format Bar. A color menu appears, as
shown in Figure 6-5. Click a color to change the color of your selected text.
✦Click the Background Color button on the Format bar. A color menu
appears, much like the one for the text color. Click a color to appear in
the background of your selected text.
✦Click the Bold, Italic, or Underline icons on the Format bar. 
If you suddenly change your mind about any of the formatting changes you
made, choose Edit➪Undo or press Ô+Z to reverse the last changes you made.
Adjusting text spacing and margins
You can change how letters look by messing with the font, but you can also
change the way a block of text looks by changing how it’s spaced on the
page. In concrete terms, this means changing:
✦Line spacing: Defines how close lines in a paragraph appear.
✦Text justification: Defines how text aligns within the left and right margins.
✦Margins: Defines the left and right boundaries that text can’t go past.

Changing line spacing
Line spacing can vary from 0.5 to 2.0. (A value of 1.0 is single spacing, and a
value of 2.0 is double spacing.) To change line spacing, follow these steps:
1. Select at least two lines of text you want to modify.
2. Click the Line Spacing pop-up menu on the Format Bar and choose a
number such as 1.5 or 2.0, as shown in Figure 6-6.
Line spacing values less than 1.0, such as 0.5, can cause lines to overlap,
which makes the text hard to read.
Changing justification
The four types of justification are
✦Align left: Text appears flush against the left margin but ragged along
the right margin
✦Center: Each line of text is centered within the left and right margins, so
text appears ragged on both left and right margins
✦Align right: Text appears flush against the right margin but ragged along
the left margin
✦Justify: Text appears flush against both the left and right margins, but
extra spaces appear between words and characters
Figure 6-7 shows four paragraphs. The first is aligned left, the second is
centered, the third is aligned right, and the final paragraph is justified.
To set your text justification, follow these steps:
1. Select the text you want to modify.
2. Click the Align left, Center, Align Right, or Justify icons on the 
Format bar.

Defining margins
The left and right margins only define text that appears on the page (Word
Processing layout). The left and right margins of text boxes are defined by
the text box size.
To define the left and right margins of text, you can use the ruler, which
appears at the top of the Pages window. The ruler lets you define an exact
location for your margins, such as placing the left margin exactly 1.5 inches
from the left side of the page.
To define the left and right margins of text, follow these steps:
1. Select the text you want to modify.
2. Click and drag the Left Margin marker to a new position on the ruler
and then release the mouse button, as shown in Figure 6-8. 
The Left Margin marker looks like an upside-down blue triangle that
appears on the left side of the ruler.

If the ruler isn’t visible, choose View➪Show Rulers.
3. Click and drag the Indent marker to a new position on the ruler and
then release the mouse button (refer to Figure 6-8). 
The Indent marker looks like a thin blue rectangle that appears over the
Left margin marker.
4. Click and drag the Right Margin marker to a new position on the ruler
and then release the mouse button (refer to Figure 6-8).
The Right Margin marker looks like an upside-down blue marker that
appears on the right side of the ruler.
Dragging the Left and Right margin markers on the ruler is a fast way to
adjust the margins, but for a more precise way, follow these steps:
1. Select the text you want to modify.
2. Click the Inspector icon (the one that looks like a little “i” in a blue
circle) in the upper-right corner of the Pages window, or choose
View➪Show Inspector. 
An Inspector window appears.
3. Click the Text Inspector icon (the big T).
4. Click the Tabs tab, as shown in Figure 6-9.
5. Enter a value in the First Line, Left, or Right text box or click the up
and down arrows to chose a value.

Using Formatting Styles
You might have a favorite way to format text. Although you could manually
change each formatting feature, you might find it faster and easier to use
styles instead. Formatting styles store different types of formatting that you
can apply to text. By using and creating formatting styles, you can format
text quickly and easily.
Applying styles
The following are the three types of styles you can apply to text:
✦Paragraph styles affect an entire paragraph where the end of a paragraph
is defined by a line that ends where you pressed Return. 
✦Character styles can affect characters or words. 
✦List styles affect multiple lines of text where each line of text ends when
your press Return. (Think To Do lists or bullet points.)

Creating temporary styles
Pages provides paragraph, character, and list styles, but you might need to
format text in a certain way that Pages doesn’t offer. In that case, you can
copy the style from existing text and paste that style to format other text
automatically. 
Copying and pasting formatting
To copy and paste formatting from existing text, follow these steps:
1. Format text in a certain way, such as changing the fonts and font size.
2. Click (or move the cursor) inside the formatted text.
3. Choose Format➪Copy Character Style (or Copy Paragraph Style).
4. Select text that you want to format the same way as the text you chose
in Step 1.
5. Choose Format➪Paste Character Style (or Paste Paragraph Style). 
Pages copies your style over the text you selected in Step 4.
Saving a formatting style
If you format text a certain way repeatedly, you might want to save your
formatting as a style that appears in the Styles Drawer. That way you can
choose that style later just by clicking on the name of your saved style.
To save your own style in the Styles Drawer, follow these steps:
1. Format text in a certain way, such as changing the fonts and font size.
2. Click (or move the cursor) inside the formatted text.
3. Click the Styles Drawer button to open the Styles Drawer.
4. Click the Plus sign button in the bottom left corner of the Styles Drawer.
A New Paragraph Style dialog appears.
5. Type a descriptive name for your style and click OK. 
Your style name now appears in the Styles Drawer. The next time you
need to use this style, select text and click on this style name in the
Styles Drawer.
To delete a style from the Styles Drawer, right-click on the style and choose
Delete Style. When a dialog appears, click in the pop-up menu to choose a
style to format text currently formatted by the style you want to delete.
Then click Replace.

Creating and Placing Text Boxes

Creating and Placing Text Boxes
Text boxes hold text that you can place anywhere on a page (even in the middle
of other text). You can create and place text boxes on both word processing
and page layout documents.
Creating a text box
To create a text box, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Text Box or click the Text Box icon. 
Pages displays a text box, as shown in Figure 6-14.

Moving a text box
After you’ve created a text box, you’ll probably want to move it. To move a
text box, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor inside the text box.
2. Click and drag the text box to its new location.
3. Release the mouse button when you’ve arrived at your destination.
Resizing a text box
Sometimes a text box will be too large or small for the amount of text you
typed inside of it. To fix this problem, you can resize a text box by following
these steps:
1. Click anywhere inside the text box. 
Handles appear around the text box border, as shown in Figure 6-15.
2. Move the pointer over a handle until the pointer turns into a two-way
pointing arrow.

Creating linked text boxes
If you type more text than a text box can display, you see a Clipping Indicator
icon — it appears as a plus sign inside a square at the bottom of the text
box, as shown in Figure 6-16.
When you see the Clipping Indicator at the bottom of a text box, you have
two choices. First, you can resize the text box so it can display more text, as
described in the preceding section. This might not always be practical
because you might not want to expand a text box any larger. 
As a second alternative to dealing with too much text, you can link text
boxes. Linked text boxes allow text from one text box to flow into another
text box.

Unlinking text boxes
After you’ve linked two or more text boxes, you might decide you don’t want
linked text boxes after all. To unlink text boxes, follow these steps:
1. Click the text box that you want to unlink from another text box.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Choose Format➪Text Box➪Break Connection into Text Box
• Move the pointer over the end of the connection line, hold down the
mouse button, drag the mouse away from the text box, and release
the mouse button.
When you unlink text boxes, the text fills up (and overflows) the first text
box, leaving the unlinked text box empty. 
Wrapping text around a text box
A new text box often appears near other text. To prevent a text box you’ve
added from covering up other text, you need to wrap the (already present)
text around the new text box. To define how to wrap text around a text box,
follow these steps:

Modifying a picture
Pages provides two ways to modify the appearance of a picture: Masking and
Instant Alpha. Masking acts like a cookie cutter that displays only part of an
image within a shape. Instant Alpha makes part of an image transparent so
that you can remove parts of the image, such as the sky in the background.
Masking a picture
To apply a mask over a picture, follow these steps:
1. Click the picture you want to mask. 
Handles appear around your chosen picture.
2. Choose Format➪Mask (or Format➪Mask with Shape and choose a
shape, such as Right Triangle or Diamond. 
Your chosen mask appears over your picture, as shown in Figure 6-21.
3. Move the pointer over the mask handles, then click and drag the han-
dles to resize the mask.
4. Move the pointer over the dimmed portion of the picture outside the
mask and then click and drag the dimmed part to adjust which part of
the picture appears within the mask.
5. Click Edit Mask. 
Pages displays your completed masked picture, as shown in Figure 6-22.
If you drag the slider above the Edit Mask button, you can resize the picture
to make it larger or smaller.
You can apply only one mask on a picture at a time. If you want to apply a
different mask to a picture, you must remove the first mask by clicking the
masked picture and then choosing Format➪Unmask.

Turning a picture transparent with Instant Alpha
The Instant Alpha feature lets you cut away parts of a picture. For example, if
you have a picture of a person’s face, you might want to trim away the back-
ground image of the wall so you see only the person’s face and not the wall
behind. 
To use the Instant Alpha feature, follow these steps:
1. Click the picture you want to modify. 
Handles appear around your chosen picture.
2. Choose Format➪Instant Alpha. 
A dialog appears over your picture, telling you how to use the Instant
Alpha feature.
3. Click and drag your mouse over the portion of your picture that you
want to make transparent (such as the sky). 
Pages highlights all parts of your picture that are similar in color to the
area that you originally pointed, at as shown in Figure 6-23.
4. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the portion of the
picture that the Instant Alpha feature has highlighted and turned
transparent.

You can use the Instant Alpha feature multiple times to remove different
colors from the same picture.
Polishing Your Document
When you’re done designing your document, you’re ready to show it to the
world. Of course, before you show your document to others, you should
spell check your document. Fortunately, Pages is happy to help you check a
document’s spelling. Then you can choose to save your document in a variety
of formats to ensure that others can read it.
Spell checking a document
Pages can spell check your entire document, including text trapped inside
text boxes and shapes. To spell check an entire document, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Spelling. 
(If you choose Edit➪Spelling➪Check Spelling, Pages highlights
misspelled words but won’t offer any suggestions.)
A dialog appears, highlighting misspelled words and offering possible
corrections, as shown in Figure 6-24.
Figure 6-24:

dialog lets
you pick
from a list of
correctly
spelled
words.

2. Choose one of the following:
• Ignore: Skips over the misspelled word.
• Learn: Stores the selected word in Pages’ dictionary
• Find Next: Looks for the next misspelled word.
• Change: Changes the misspelled word with the word selected in the
list box.
3. Click the Close button of the Spelling dialog at any time to make it go
away.
Pages can check your spelling as you type. The moment Pages identifies a
misspelled word, it underlines it with a red dotted line. If you right-click
(Control-click) over any word underlined with a red dotted line, Pages 
displays a pop-up menu of correctly spelled words that you can choose. If
you want to turn off spell checking as you type, choose Edit➪Spelling➪
Check Spelling As You Type to clear the check mark in front of this command.
It’s a good idea to proof-read your document even after spell-checking, since
the spell checker only makes sure the word is correctly spelled. If you’ve
typed “I have to cats” when you really meant to type “I have two cats,” no
spell checker on earth is going to flag that.
Exporting a document
When you choose the File➪Save command, Pages saves documents in its own
proprietary file format. However, if you want to share your Pages documents
with others who don’t have the Pages program, you’ll need to export your
document into another file format, such as
✦PDF: Saves your document as a series of static pages stored in the PDF
Adobe Acrobat file format that can be viewed (but not necessarily
edited) by any computer with a PDF viewing program.
✦Word: Saves your document as a Microsoft Word file, which can be opened
by any word processor that can read and edit Microsoft Word files. 
✦RTF: Saves your document as a Rich Text Format (RTF) file, which many
programs can open and edit.
✦Plain Text: Saves your document as text without any formatting or
graphic effects. 

Polishing Your Document
508
The PDF file format preserves formatting 100 percent, but doesn’t let anyone
edit that file unless they use a separate PDF editing program such as Acrobat
Pro. If someone needs to edit your document, both the Word and RTF options
preserve Pages documents well. The Plain Text option is useful only if you
can’t transfer your Pages document to another program as a Word or RTF file.
To export a Pages document, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export. 
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-25.
2. Select an option such as Word or RTF.
3. Click Next. 
4. In the new dialog that appears, enter a name for your exported document
in the Save As text box. 
5. Continuing down the dialog box, click to select the folder where you
want to store your presentation.
You might need to switch drives or folders until you find where you want
to save your file.
6. Click Export.
When you export a document, your original Pages document remains
untouched in its original location where you last saved it.

f you need to inform or convince a group of people about a subject, you
often need to make a presentation. Although you could give a presentation
just by talking, it’s harder to emphasize certain points and ideas through
words alone. That’s why you need a presentation program like Keynote. 
Keynote can take the hassle out of creating, organizing, and giving a presen-
tation so you can concentrate more of your time on talking to an audience
and less of your time fumbling around with transparencies, whiteboards,
and felt markers that stain your fingertips and emit an unpleasant odor. 
Best of all, Keynote can spice up your presentation by including audio and
visual effects, from playing music and movies to showing visually interesting
effects — stuff like text sliding across the screen or dissolving away into
nothingness. Such effects can enhance your presentation and help hold an
audience’s attention. 
Keynote comes as part of the $79 iWork suite. Your Mac may come with a trial
version of iWork, which lets you try Keynote to see if you might find it useful.
Creating a Presentation
An entire Keynote presentation consists of one or more slides, where a slide
displays information to make a single point. Each slide typically contains
text, as shown in Figure 7-1, although graphics, video, and audio can make
an appearance as well. 

Working with Themes
510
To make your slides more interesting to watch, you can also add transition
effects that appear when you switch from one slide to another. To further
emphasize the information on a particular slide, you can add individual
visual effects to specific items, such as making text rotate or making a
graphic image glide across the screen and halt in place. 
The basic steps to creating a presentation in Keynote involve
1. Pick a theme to use for your presentation.
2. Creating one or more slides.
3. Typing text or placing graphics on each slide.
4. (Optional) Adding an audio or video file to each slide.
5. (Optional) Adding visual effects to animate an entire slide or just the
text or graphics that appear on that slide.
The rest of this chapter goes into detail about each of these steps.
Working with Themes
A presentation consists of multiple slides. While you could create a generic
presentation where plain black text appears against a white background, this
can be boring. To spice up your presentation, Keynote provides pre-designed
background graphics called themes, which provide a consistent appearance
for your slides such as the font, size, style, and background color.

Working with Themes
511
Choosing a theme for a new presentation
A theme defines the appearance of text and graphics on a slide, although you
can always modify this later. To pick a theme, follow these steps:
1. Load Keynote by double-clicking on the Keynote icon in the Applications
folder (or choose File➪New if Keynote is already running). 
A dialog appears, displaying different themes you can choose, as shown
in Figure 7-2.
2. Click a theme and then click the Choose button. 
Keynote creates the first slide of your presentation using your chosen
theme. At this point, you can add text, graphics, audio, or video to the
slide, or you can add new slides.
Defining a default theme
If you have a favorite theme, you can make it the default theme that Keynote
uses every time you create a new presentation. To define a default theme,
follow these steps:
1. Load Keynote. 
2. Choose Keynote➪Preferences. 
The Preferences window appears.
3. Click the General Icon. 
The General Preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-2:

4. Under the For New Documents category, select the Use Theme radio
button. 
The first time you select the Use Theme radio button, a Theme dialog
appears right away. After this first time, you’ll have to choose a theme
by selecting the Use Theme radio button and then clicking Choose.
5. Click to select the theme you want to use as the default theme and
then click Choose.
6. Click the Close button of the Preferences window. 
Changing Presentation Views
After you’ve created a presentation, Keynote offers four different ways to
view a presentation:
✦Navigator: Useful for both editing individual slides and manipulating all
the slides in an entire presentation. 
✦Outline: Useful for viewing and editing just the text that appears on
slides, as shown in Figure 7-4. 
✦Slide Only: Useful for editing the text and graphics of a single slide, as
shown in Figure 7-5.
✦Light Table: Useful for manipulating a large number of slides in a presen-
tation, as shown in Figure 7-6.
To switch to a different view, choose View from the Keynote menu and then
choose Navigator, Outline, Slide Only, or Light Table.

Working with Slides
514
Working with Slides 
When you create a new presentation, that presentation contains just one slide.
Because you’ll usually need more than one slide to create a presentation,
you’ll probably want to add more slides. And if you go overboard and add too
many slides, you can always winnow out a few. 
When working with slides, you often need to select multiple slides in the
Slide Organizer pane or the Light Table view. If you hold down the Ô key, you
can click and select multiple slides. If you hold down the Shift key and click
two different slides, you select a range of slides.
Adding a slide
To add a slide to a presentation, follow these steps:
1. Click a slide in either the Slide Organizer pane or in the Light Table view. 
Your new slide will appear directly after the slide that you click on.
2. Choose one of the following to add a new slide:
✦Click the New (plus sign) icon
✦Choose Slide➪New Slide
✦Click a slide in the Slide Organizer pane or Light Table view and press
Return
✦Right-click a slide and choose New Slide

Working with Slides
515
Your newly created slide adapts the theme of the previous slide (the slide
you selected in Step 1). 
Rearranging slides
After you’ve created two or more slides in a presentation, you might want to
rearrange their positions. 
Keynote displays slides in the order they appear in the Slide Organizer. The
top slide appears first, followed by the slide directly underneath, and so on.
To rearrange slides in a presentation, follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the following:
• View➪Navigator (Displays slides vertically in the Slide Organizer pane.)
• View➪Light Table (Displays slides in rows and columns.)
2. Click and drag a slide in the Slide Organizer pane (or Light Table
view) to its new position.
In Navigator view, Keynote displays a horizontal line with a downward-
pointing arrow to show you where your slide will appear if you release
the mouse button, as shown in Figure 7-7. In Light Table view, Keynote
moves slide icons out of the way to show you where your new slide will
appear.

3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new position of
the slide in your presentation.
Deleting a slide
Eventually, you might find that you don’t need a slide any more. To delete a
slide, follow these steps:
1. In either the Slide Organizer pane or Light Table view, select the
slide(s) that you want to delete. 
2. Choose one of the following:
✦Press Delete.
✦Choose Edit➪Delete.
✦Right-click and choose Delete.
If you delete a slide by mistake, choose Edit➪Undo Delete (or press Ô+Z).
Grouping slides
Many times, two or more slides are so closely related that you’d never use
one slide without the other. To make sure adjacent slides stay together,
Keynote lets you organize them into a group. After you’ve organized two or
more slides as a group, you can move and delete the entire group of slides as
easily as moving or deleting a single slide.
Putting slides in a group
To create a group, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Navigator.
2. Move all the slides that you want to place in a group so they all
appear stacked over one another in the Slide Organizer pane.
3. Click the second slide of the group.
4. Hold down the Shift key and click the last slide of the group.
5. Press Tab. 
Keynote indents your selected slides. Your group consists of all the
indented slides plus the nonindented, first slide of the group, as shown
in Figure 7-8.
You can create groups of slides within other groups of slides.

Moving a group
After you’ve created a group of two or more slides, you can treat that group
as a single item and move it. To move a group, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Navigator.
2. Move the pointer over the first slide of the group you want to move. 
The first slide of a group displays a triangle to its left.
3. Click and drag the slide group to a new location in the Slide
Organizer pane. 
As you drag a group, Keynote displays all the slides of that group. 
4. Release the mouse button. 
Your entire group of slides appears in its new location.
Deleting a group
You can easily delete an entire group of slides at the touch of a button, so be
careful. To delete a group of slides, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Navigator.

3. Press Delete. 
Keynote deletes your entire group.
If you delete a group of slides by mistake, press Ô+Z or chose Edit➪Undo
Delete.
Manipulating Text
Text appears on a slide in a text box. Most slides contain two text boxes,
where the top text box defines the title of a slide and the bottom text box
displays the bullet points of a slide (refer to Figure 7-1).
The title of a slide typically defines the purpose of the slide, and the bullet
points underneath provide supporting ideas. A slide can have only one Title
text box and one Bullet Point text box, but each Bullet Point text box can
contain multiple bullet points.
Editing text on a slide
Initially, every slide contains an empty Title text box and an empty Bullet
Point text box. To place text on a slide, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Navigator. 
2. In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide that you want to edit. 
Your chosen slide appears.
3. Double-click the placeholder text that appears in the Title or Bullet
Point text boxes. 
4. Type text or use the arrow keys and Delete key to edit existing text.
To ensure you don’t give a presentation filled with typos and misspelled
words, check the spelling in your presentation by choosing Edit➪
Spelling➪Spelling.
Formatting text
After you’ve created text, you can format it by changing fonts, font size, or
color. Formatting can emphasize text or make it prettier. 
Use fonts and colors sparingly. Using too many fonts or colors can make text
harder to read. When choosing colors, make sure you use colors that con-
trast with the slide’s background color. For instance, light-yellow text against
a white background will be nearly impossible to read.

The top of the Colors window provides a variety of different color pickers
that display colors as sliders, color spectrums, or even as crayons. So if you
don’t like the color wheel, click on a different color picker and use that one
instead.
Adding Media Files
Text by itself can be as monotonous to read as the flight arrival and departure
screens at an airport. To make your presentation more appealing, add sound,
pictures, and movies. Sound can be an audio recording of a song stored in
iTunes or edited in GarageBand, pictures can be digital photographs stored 
in iPhoto, and movies can be short video clips you’ve edited and stored in
iMovie. 
Adding sound
You can add any audio file stored in iTunes or GarageBand. To add sound to
a slide, follow these steps:
1. In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide where you want to play an

Editing Pictures and Movies
After you’ve pasted a picture or movie on to a slide, you can always move,
resize, or even modify that picture. Moving and resizing a picture or movie
lets you place a picture or movie in the exact spot you want it to appear on a
slide. Modifying the picture lets you either correct an image or create
unusual visual effects.
Moving and resizing a picture or movie
To move or resize a movie, follow these steps:
1. In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide where you want to move
or resize a picture or movie.
2. Click the picture or movie. 
Handles appear around your chosen picture or movie.
3. To move a picture or movie, place the cursor over the middle of the
image, click and drag the picture or movie to a new location on the
slide, and then release the mouse button.
4. To resize a picture or movie, click and drag a handle to resize the
picture or movie and then release the mouse button.
If you hold down the Shift key while resizing a picture or movie, you’ll retain
the height and width proportions.

Editing Pictures and Movies
524
Modifying a picture
Keynote provides two ways to modify the appearance of a picture: Masking
and Instant Alpha. Masking lets you display just a portion of an image, such
as an oval or star-shaped area. Instant Alpha lets you make part of an image
transparent so that the background of a slide can be seen through an image.
Masking a picture
A mask acts like a cookie cutter that you plop over a picture to save anything
inside the cookie cutter shape, but hide any part of a picture that appears 
outside this cookie cutter shape. Keynote provides a rectangular mask and a
variety of other shaped masks such as ovals, stars, arrows, and triangles. 
To apply a mask on a picture, follow these steps:
1. In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide that contains the picture
you want to mask.
2. Click the picture you want to mask. 
Handles appear around your chosen picture.
3. Choose Format➪Mask (or Format➪Mask with Shape and choose a
shape such as Polygon or Diamond). 
Your chosen mask appears over your picture, as shown in Figure 7-14.

4. Click and drag a mask handle to resize the mask.
If you hold down the Shift key while dragging a mask handle, you’ll
retain the height and width aspect ratio.
5. Move the pointer over the dimmed portion of the picture outside the
mask, then drag over the dimmed portion to adjust which part of the
picture appears within the mask.
6. Click the Edit Mask button. 
Keynote masks your picture, as shown in Figure 7-15.
You can apply only one mask on a picture at a time. If you want to apply a
different mask over a picture, you must remove the first mask by choosing
Format➪Unmask. 
Turning a picture transparent with Instant Alpha
Keynote’s Instant Alpha feature lets you remove a portion of a picture. This
can create unusual visual effects by stripping unwanted portions of a picture,
such as the sky, and just keeping the parts you like, as shown in Figure 7-16.

3. Choose Format➪Instant Alpha (or click the Alpha icon on the Toolbar
at the top of the Keynote window). 
A dialog appears over your picture, telling you how to use the Instant
Alpha feature.
4. Place the pointer over the portion of your picture that you want to
make transparent (such as the sky) and then drag the mouse. 
Keynote highlights all parts of your picture that are similar in color to
the area that you originally pointed at, as shown in Figure 7-17.
5. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the portion of the
picture that the Instant Alpha feature has highlighted and turned
transparent. 
You can use the Instant Alpha feature multiple times to remove different
colors from the same picture. If you make a mistake, choose Edit ➪Undo
Instant Alpha or press Ô+Z.

Creating Transitions and Effects
527
Creating Transitions and Effects
To make your presentations visually interesting to watch, you can add tran-
sitions that define how slides, text, and graphics appear and disappear. Slide
transitions define how a slide disappears from the screen. Text and graphic
effects define how the text or graphic initially appears on the slide, how it
disappears off a slide, and how it can move around a slide.
Creating a slide transition
To create a slide transition, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Navigator.
2. In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide that you want to display
with a transition.

Polishing Your Presentation
When you’re done modifying the slides in your presentation, you’ll need to
show your presentation to others. You might give a presentation in person
or just pass out your presentation to others so they can view it at their
leisure without you around. 
Viewing a presentation
After you’ve finished creating a presentation, you need to view it to see how
it actually looks. The slide order or visual effects might have looked good
when you put your presentation together, but when viewed in its entirety,
you might suddenly notice gaps in your presentation. To view a presentation,
follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Navigator.
2. In the Organizer pane, click the first slide you want to view. 
If you click the first slide of your presentation, you can view your entire
presentation. If you click a slide in the middle of your presentation, you
can view only that part of your presentation from that slide to the end.
3. Choose View➪Play Slideshow. 
The slide you chose in Step 2 appears.
4. Click the mouse button or press the space bar to view each effect and
slide.
If you’re at the last slide of your presentation, clicking the mouse button
or pressing the space bar exits out of your presentation.
5. (Optional) Press Esc if you want to stop viewing your presentation
before reaching the last slide.
Rehearsing a presentation
Viewing a presentation lets you make sure that all the slides are in the right
order and that all effects and transitions work as you expect. Before giving
your presentation, you might want to rehearse it and let Keynote show you
approximately how much time you spend on each slide. 
Rehearsing can give you only a guess of the time needed to give your presen-
tation. In real life, the audience and conditions around you might interfere
with your timing, such as an impatient audience sitting in a stuffy conference
room where the air conditioning suddenly breaks down. 

Polishing Your Presentation
532
To rehearse a presentation, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Navigator. 
2. In the Slide Organizer pane, click the first slide you want to view.
3. Choose View➪Rehearse Slideshow. 
Keynote displays your slides with a timer underneath, as shown in
Figure 7-21.
4. Practice what you’re going to say when presenting each slide and
then press the space bar or click the mouse button to advance to the
next slide.
Exporting a presentation
When you give a presentation, you’ll probably do it directly from your Mac.
However, there may come a time when you’ll need to save your presentation
to run on a different type of computer. Fortunately, Keynote lets you save (or
export) a Keynote presentation in one of the following file formats:
✦QuickTime: Saves your presentation as a movie that can be played on a
Windows or Mac computer that has the free QuickTime player. This
movie preserves all transitions and visual effects.

✦PowerPoint: Saves your presentation as a PowerPoint file that you can
edit and run on any computer that runs PowerPoint. (Certain visual
effects and transitions might not work in PowerPoint.)
✦PDF: Saves your presentation as a series of static images stored in the
PDF Adobe Acrobat file format that can be viewed by any computer with
a PDF viewing program. Any interesting visual or transition effects
between slides will be lost.
✦Images: Saves each slide as a separate graphic file.
✦Flash: Saves your presentation as a movie that can be played on any
computer that has the free Flash player. This movie preserves all transitions
and visual effects.
✦HTML: Saves each slide as a separate Web page. Any interesting visual
or transition effects between slides will be lost.
✦iPod: Saves your presentation as a movie specially designed to play on
an iPod. 
If you want to preserve your visual effects and transitions, save your presen-
tation as a QuickTime, iPod, or Flash movie. If you want to preserve and edit
your presentation, save it as a PowerPoint file.
To export a Keynote presentation, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export. 
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 7-22.
2. Click an option such as the QuickTime or PowerPoint icon.

N
umbers is a spreadsheet program designed to help you manipulate
and calculate numbers for a wide variety of tasks, such as balancing a
budget, calculating a loan, and creating an invoice. The Numbers program
not only lets you organize numbers and perform calculations on them, but
the program also lets you create line, bar, and pie charts that graphically help
you analyze and understand what your data means. By making calculations
easy and creating charts from your numbers even easier, Numbers can help
you make sense out of any numeric data.
Understanding the Parts of a Numbers Spreadsheet
Basically, a Numbers spreadsheet consists of one or more sheets, which are
completely blank like an empty sheet of paper. On each sheet, you can place
the following items, as shown in Figure 8-1:
✦Tables
✦Charts
✦Text boxes
✦Pictures

Understanding the Parts of a Numbers Spreadsheet
536
A table consists of rows and columns. The intersection of a row and column
is called a cell, which is where you can type and store numbers, text, and 
formulas, as shown in Figure 8-2.
A chart displays data stored in a table. Common types of charts are line, bar,
pie, and column charts, as shown in Figure 8-3. 
Both text boxes and pictures serve mostly decorative functions. A text box
lets you type and store text independent of the rows and columns in a table.
Pictures let you add decorative images on a sheet, such as a company logo.
By letting you arrange tables, charts, text boxes, and pictures on a sheet,
Numbers helps you manipulate numbers and present your information in a
visually appealing way that ordinary spreadsheets can’t match.
Putting together a spreadsheet is a pretty simple process. The following list
points out the highlights:
✦Start with a sheet. When you create a new Numbers file, either from
scratch or using a template, Numbers automatically creates one sheet
with one table on it. From there, it’s your job to start filling that table
with data. Add more tables if you want — yes, a sheet can hold multiple
tables — or start spicing up your data presentation with charts or pictures.
(More on that later.)
Figure 8-1:
The parts of
a Numbers
spreadsheet.

Book IV
Chapter 8

with Numbers
Understanding the Parts of a Numbers Spreadsheet
537
✦Fill a table with numbers and text. After setting up at least one table on
a sheet, you can move the table around on the sheet and/or resize it, as
spelled out later in this chapter. When you’re happy with the table’s
position on the sheet and the table’s size, you can start typing numbers
into the table’s rows and columns. Of course, a long list of numbers is
relatively meaningless, so you also need to type text in a table that 
identifies what those numbers mean, such as “August Sales” or “Number
of Screwdrivers Sold.” 
✦Create formulas. After you’ve typed numbers in a table along with
descriptive text, you also need to enter formulas that manipulate one or
more numbers in certain ways, such as adding a column of numbers.
Formulas take your numbers and calculate a result, such as identifying
how much your company made in sales last month or how a single sales
person’s sales results have changed each month since the beginning of
the year. 
Formulas not only calculate useful results, but they also let you enter
hypothetical numbers to see possible results. For example, if every sales
person improved his or her sales results by 5 percent every month, how
much of an increase in cash would that bring in to the company? Now,
what happens if every sales person lowered his or her sales results by 3
percent every month? By typing in different values, you can ask “What
if?” questions with your data and formulas.

✦Visualizing data with charts. Just glancing at a dozen numbers in a row
or column might not show you much of anything. That’s why Numbers
lets you create charts based on your data. By turning numeric data into
line, bar, or pie charts, Numbers can help you spot trends in your data.
✦Polish your sheets. Most spreadsheets consist of rows and columns of
numbers with a bit of descriptive text thrown in for good measure.
Although functional, such spreadsheets are boring to look at. That’s why
Numbers gives you the chance to place text boxes and pictures on your
sheets to make your information (tables and charts) look pretty for
printing. 
Creating a Numbers Spreadsheet
To help you create a spreadsheet, Numbers provides a handful of templates
that you can use or modify. If you prefer, you can use the blank template to
create a spreadsheet (one sheet with one table on it) from scratch. If you
design a particularly useful spreadsheet, you can even save it (by choosing
File➪Save as Template) as a template to use in the future.

Working with Sheets
539
To create a spreadsheet based on a template, follow these steps:
1. Load Numbers by double-clicking on the Numbers icon in the
Applications folder (or choose File➪New if Numbers is already running). 
A dialog appears, displaying the different templates you can choose
from, as shown in Figure 8-4.
2. Click a template category in the listing on the left, click a particular
template displayed in the main pane, and then click Choose. 
Numbers displays your chosen template. 
If you want to start out with a blank spreadsheet, click the Blank
template in the listing on the left.
Working with Sheets
Every Numbers spreadsheet needs at least one sheet. A sheet acts like a limit-
less page that can hold any number of tables and charts. Ideally, you should
use sheets to organize the information in your spreadsheet, such as using
one sheet to hold January sales results, a second sheet to hold February
sales results, and a third sheet to hold a line chart that shows each sales
person’s results for the first two months. 
When you create a new spreadsheet, it initially starts out with one sheet, but
you can always add more if you want.
To help organize your sheets, Numbers stores the names of all your sheets in
the Sheets pane on the left. Indented underneath each sheet is a list of all
tables and charts stored on that particular sheet. 
Figure 8-4:

Working with Sheets
540
To view the contents of a specific sheet, just click that sheet name in the
Sheet pane. To view a particular table or chart, first find the sheet that
contains that table or chart. Then click that specific table or chart.
Adding a sheet
You can always add another sheet if you need one. When you add a sheet,
Numbers creates one table on that sheet automatically. To add a sheet,
choose one of the following:
✦Choose Insert➪Sheet.
✦Right-click anywhere inside the Sheet pane and choose New Sheet.
✦Click the Sheet icon that appears above the Sheet pane.
Deleting a sheet
If you need a sheet to go away, clear out, disappear, whatever, you can delete
it. When you delete a sheet, you’ll also delete any tables or charts stored on
that sheet. To delete a sheet, follow these steps:
1. Click the sheet you want to delete in the Sheet pane.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Press the Delete key.
• Right-click on a sheet name and choose Delete Sheet.
• Choose Edit➪Delete.
A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete the sheet.
3. Click Delete (or Cancel).
Adding a table or chart
A sheet can hold one or more tables and charts. When you add a table or
chart, the table or chart is blank. To add a table or chart, follow these steps:
1. In the Sheet pane, click the sheet where you want to add a table or
chart.
2. Choose one of the following and select an option, as shown in Figure
8-5 or 8-6:
• Click the Tables icon (or choose Insert➪Table).
• Click the Charts icon (or choose Insert➪Chart).

Deleting a table or chart
When you create a table or chart, you don’t have to keep it forever. You can
quietly make it go away and then pretend it was never there. Keep in mind,
though, that when you delete a table, Numbers deletes all data (numbers,
text, and formulas) stored on that table. To delete a table or chart, follow
these steps:
1. In the Sheet pane, click the table or chart you want to delete.
2. Choose one of the following:
• Press the Delete key.
• Right-click on a table or chart and choose Delete.
• Choose Edit➪Delete.

Designing Tables
542
Naming sheets, tables, and charts
Numbers gives each sheet, table, and chart a generic name, such as Sheet 2,
Table 1, or Chart 3. To help you better understand the type of information
stored on each sheet, table, and chart, you should use more descriptive
names, especially once you start adding multiple tables and charts (which
you’ll find out about later in this chapter). 
To name a sheet, table, or chart in the Sheet pane follow these steps:
1. Choose one of the following:
• Double-click a sheet, table, or chart name. 
• Right-click a sheet, table, or chart name and choose Rename.
2. Type a new name or use the arrow keys and the Delete key to edit an
existing name.
Choose a descriptive name for your sheets, tables, and charts. The names
you choose are purely for your benefit.
Designing Tables
A table consists of row and columns, with columns labeled using capital let-
ters (Column C or Column H) and rows labeled using numbers (Row 4 or
Row 28). The intersection of a row and column is a cell, which is where you
can type numbers, text, or formulas.
Them’s the basics. If you have that down, you have enough info to make a
simple table. But there’s oh so much more you can do.
Moving a table
After creating a table on a sheet, you might want to move it to a better 
position. To move a table, follow these steps: 
1. In the Sheets pane, click the table that you want to move. 
Numbers displays your selected table.
2. Click anywhere inside the table. 
The table displays column and row headings, a Move corner (in the
upper left corner of the table), and a Resize corner (in the bottom-right
corner of the table), as shown in Figure 8-7.
3. Move the pointer over the Move corner until the pointer turns into an
arrow with a four-way pointing arrow underneath.

Book IV
Chapter 8
Doing Calculations 
with Numbers
Designing Tables
543
4. Click and drag the table to a new location on the sheet.
5. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the table’s new
location.
Resizing a table
You might need to resize a table for various reasons: to fit it in a small space,
to make it larger and easier to read, and so on. Numbers offers two ways to
resize a table. First, you can make a table larger (or smaller) while retaining
the same number of rows and columns, which increases the height and
width of rows and columns. The second way to resize a table automatically
adds (or removes) rows and columns so all rows and columns inside the
table retain the same physical dimensions.
To stretch or shrink a table (without adding or subtracting rows or
columns), follow these steps:
1. In the Sheets pane, click the table that you want to resize. 
Numbers displays your selected table with handles around it.
2. Move the pointer over a handle until the pointer turns into a two-way
pointing arrow.
3. Click and drag a handle to enlarge or shrink the table. 
Notice that any data inside the table grows or shrinks as well.
4. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the size of your
table.

Designing Tables
544
To resize a table by adding or subtracting rows and columns, you use the
Resize corner. Just follow these steps: 
1. In the Sheets pane, click the table that you want to resize. 
Numbers displays your selected table with handles around it.
2. Click anywhere inside the table. 
The table displays column and row headings, a Move corner, and a
Resize corner (refer to Figure 8-7.)
3. Move the pointer over the Resize corner in the bottom right corner of
the table.
4. Click and drag the Resize corner to resize the table on the sheet.
As you drag the Resize corner, you add (or delete) rows and columns.
5. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the table’s number
of rows and columns.
Adding a row or column
You can add a row or column in the middle of a table or at the end. If you
add a row or column in the middle of a table, the newly added row or
column will move existing data. If you add a row or column at the end of a
table, you just make the table a little bit larger.
To add multiple columns or rows, highlight two or more column or row
headings, click on the Table menu, and then choose Add Columns
Before/After or Add Rows Above/Below.
To add a row or column in the middle of a table, click in a row or column,
choose Table and then choose one of the following from the Table menu: 
✦Add Row Above: Inserts a new row directly above the currently
selected cell.
✦Add Row Below: Inserts a new row directly below the currently selected
cell.
✦Add Column Before: Inserts a new column to the left of the currently
selected cell.
✦Add Column After: Inserts a new column to the right of the currently
selected cell.
If you move the pointer over a row or column heading (such as column D or
row 5), a downward-pointing arrow appears, and you can click it to display a
menu. From this menu, you can choose any of the options in the preceding list. 

Book IV
Chapter 8
Doing Calculations 
with Numbers
Designing Tables
545
Deleting a row or column
To delete a row or column, choose one of the following:
✦Click a cell inside the row or column you want to delete and then choose
Table➪Delete Row (or Delete Column).
✦Right-click a cell inside the row or column you want to delete, and then
choose Delete Row (or Delete Column) from the shortcut menu.
✦Move the pointer over the row or column heading (such as column A or
row 3), click the downward-pointing arrow that appears, and choose
Delete Row (or Delete column).
You can delete multiple columns or rows by highlighting two or more column
or row headings, clicking the Table menu and then choosing Delete 
Columns or Delete Rows.
Resizing rows and columns
Rows and columns define the size of cells. However, a cell that’s too small
may not show all the information stored in that cell. To fix this problem, you
can resize rows and columns.
Resizing the fast way
To resize a row or column using the mouse, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer over the border between two row or column 
headings, such as between columns A and B. 
The pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow around a vertical or
horizontal line.
2. Click and drag the mouse up/down or right/left to resize the row or
column. 
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the size of your
row or column.
If you have data stored inside a row or column, Numbers can automatically
resize the row or column to fit the largest item stored in that row or column.
To automatically resize a row or column, click a cell inside the row or
column you want to resize and choose Table➪Resize Columns to Fit Content
(or Resize Rows to Fit Content). 

Designing Tables
546
Resizing the precise way
If you want to resize a row or column to a specific height or width, follow
these steps:
1. Click a cell inside the row or column you want to resize.
2. Choose View➪Inspector. 
An Inspector window appears.
3. Click the Table Inspector icon in the Inspector window toolbar, as
shown in Figure 8-8.
4. Click in the Row Height or Column Width text box and type a value,
or click the up/down arrows in that text box to define a value.
5. Click the Close button of the Inspector window.
Formatting a table
To make your table easier to read, you can format it with a style, which basi-
cally provides different ways to color row and column headings of an entire
table with one click of the mouse. To format a table, follow these steps:
1. In the Sheet pane, click the table that you want to format. 
Numbers displays your chosen table.

2. Click a formatting style, such as Ledger or Blue Headers, in the Styles
pane in the bottom-left corner of the Numbers window. 
Numbers formats your table. If you don’t like the way your table looks,
choose another of the ten styles available.
Typing Data into Tables
The three types of data you can store inside a table are
✦Numbers
✦Text
✦Formulas
To type anything into a table, follow these steps:
1. Select a cell by clicking it or by pressing the arrow keys.
2. Type a number, text, or formula.
3. Press Return to select the cell below, press Tab to select the cell to the
right, or click in any cell where you want to type new data.
Numbers formats your table. If you don’t like the way your table looks,
choose another of the ten styles available.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each additional item you want to type into
the table.
Formatting numbers and text
When you type a number in a cell, the number will look plain like 45 or 60.3.
To make your numbers more meaningful, you should format them. For exam-
ple, the number 39 might mean nothing, but if you format it to appear as
$39.00, your number now clearly represents a dollar amount. 
To format numbers, follow these steps:
1. Click to select one cell or click and drag to select multiple cells. 
Numbers draws a border around your selected cell(s).
If you select empty cells, Numbers will automatically format any numbers
you type later into those cells.

• Style: Displays different options such as bold or italic.
• Font size: Displays a range of sizes such as 9 or 24.
• Text color: Displays a color window for coloring numbers or text.
Typing formulas
The main purpose of a table is to use the numbers you’ve stored in cells to
calculate a new result, such as adding a row or column of numbers. To calculate
and display a result, you need to store a formula in a cell. 
Numbers provides three ways to create formulas in a cell:
✦Quick formulas
✦Typed in formulas
✦Functions

Using Quick Formulas
To help you calculate numbers in a hurry, Numbers offers a variety of Quick
Formulas that can calculate common results, such as
✦Sum: Adds numbers.
✦Average: Calculates the arithmetic mean.
✦Minimum: Displays the smallest number.
✦Maximum: Displays the largest number.
✦Count: Displays how many numbers you selected.
✦Product: Multiples numbers.
To use a Quick Formula, follow these steps:
1. Select two or more cells that contain numbers.
2. Click the Function icon or choose Insert➪Function and choose a Quick
Formula (Sum, Average, Minimum, Maximum, Count, or Product). 
Numbers displays your calculates results.
If you highlight a row of numbers, the Quick Formula displays the result to
the right. If you highlight a column of numbers, the Quick Formula displays
the result at the bottom of the column. If you highlight both rows and
columns of numbers, the Quick Formula displays the result at the bottom of
each column. 
Typing in a formula
Quick Formulas are handy when they offer the formula you need, such as
adding rows or columns of numbers with the Sum formula. However, most of
the time you’ll need to create your own formulas.
Basically, every formula consists of two parts:
✦Operators: Perform calculations such as addition (+), subtraction (-),
multiplication (*), and division (/).
✦Cell references: Define where to find the data to use for calculations. 
A typical formula looks like this:
= A3 + A4
This formula tells Numbers to take the number stored in column A, row 3
and add it to the number stored in column A, row 4.

To type a formula, follow these steps:
1. Click in (or use the arrow keys to highlight) the cell where you want
the formula results to appear.
2. Type =. 
The Formula Editor appears, as shown in Figure 8-12.
You can move the Formula Editor if you move the pointer over the left
end of the Formula Editor where the pointer turns into a hand. Then
click and drag the Formula Editor to a new location.
3. Click a cell that contains the number you want to include in your 
calculation.
4. Type an operator, such as * for multiplication or / for division.
5. Click another cell that contains the number you want to include in
your calculation.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 as often as necessary.
7. Click the Accept (or Cancel) button on the Formula Editor when
you’re done. 
Numbers displays the results of your formula. If you change the numbers
in the cells you defined in Steps 3 and 5, you can see Numbers calculate
a new result instantly.
For a fast way to calculate values without having to type a formula in a cell,
you can use Instant Calculations. Just select two or more cells that contain
numbers, and you can see the Instant Calculations in the bottom-left corner
of the Numbers window, as shown in Figure 8-13.

Using functions
Typing simple formulas that add or multiply is fairly easy. However, many
calculations can get more complicated, such as trying to calculate the
amount of interest paid on a loan with a specific interest rate over a defined
period of time. 
To help you calculate commonly used formulas, Numbers provides a library
of functions — prebuilt formulas that you can plug into your table and define
what data to use without having to create the formula yourself. 
To use a function, follow these steps:
1. Click in (or use the arrow keys to highlight) the cell where you want
the function results to appear.
2. Click the Function icon. 
A pull-down menu appears.
3. Choose More Functions. 
An Insert Function dialog appears, as shown in Figure 8-14. It displays all
the available functions.
4. Click a Function category in the left pane, such as Financial or
Statistical. 
The right pane displays only those functions stored in that category.
5. Click a function in the right pane and click the Insert button. 
The Formula Editor appears, containing your chosen function.

6. Edit the formula by typing the cell names (such as C4) or clicking the
cells that contain the data the function needs to calculate a result. 
7. Click the Accept (or Cancel) button on the Formula Editor. 
Numbers shows your result.
Formatting data entry cells
After you create formulas (or functions) in cells, you can type new numbers
in the cells defined by a formula or function and watch Numbers calculate a
new result instantly. Typing a new number in a cell is easy to do, but sometimes
a formula or function requires a specific range of values. For example, if you
have a formula that calculates the sales tax, you might not want someone to
enter a sales tax over 10% or less than 5%.
To limit the types of values someone can enter in a cell, you can use one of
the following methods, as shown in Figure 8-15:
✦Sliders: Lets the user drag a slider to choose a value within a fixed
range.
✦Steppers: Lets the user click up and down arrows to choose a value that
increases or decreases in fixed increments.
✦Pop-up menus: Lets the user choose from a limited range of choices.
Formatting a cell with a slider or stepper
A slider or stepper is useful when you want to restrict a cell to a range of
values, such as 1 to 45. The main difference between the two is that a slider
appears next to a cell, whereas a stepper appears inside a cell.

To format a cell with a slider or stepper, follow these steps:
1. Click in a cell that you want to restrict to a range of values.
2. Click the Format button (it looks like a downward-pointing arrow) on
the Format bar and choose Slider or Stepper from the pull-down menu
that appears, as shown in Figure 8-16. 
A Cells Inspector window appears, as shown in Figure 8-17.
3. Click in the Minimum text box and type the minimum acceptable value.
4. Click in the Maximum text box and type the maximum acceptable value.
5. Click in the Increment text box and type a value to increase or
decrease when the user drags the slider or clicks the up and down
arrows of the stepper.
6. Click the Close button of the Inspector window. 
Numbers displays a slider next to the cell. Users have a choice of typing
a value or using the slider to define a value. If you type a value outside
the minimum and maximum range defined in Steps 4 and 5, the cell
won’t accept the invalid data.

Deleting data in cells
After you type data into a cell, you might later want to delete that data.
Numbers provides two ways to delete data in cells:
✦Delete data but retain any formatting.
✦Delete data and formatting.
To delete data but retain any formatting, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more cells that contain data you want to delete.
2. Press Delete or choose Edit➪Delete.
To delete both data and formatting in cells, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more cells that contain data and formatting you want to
delete.
2. Choose Edit➪Clear All.
Making Charts
Charts help make sense out of your numeric data by turning numbers into
pictures that can show trends or help you spot patterns such as identifying
which sales person is most consistent (and which ones are consistently the
best and worse). 
Creating a chart
Creating a chart is a three-step process. First, you have to decide what numeric
data you want to turn into a chart. Second, you need to choose a specific type
of chart to create, such as a line chart or pie chart. Finally, you have to decide
whether you want to create a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional chart.

A 3-D chart might look cool, but it can often make understanding your data
harder. You might need to experiment with different charts until you find the
one that displays your data the best.
To create a chart, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the data you want to convert into a chart. 
You can highlight data by dragging the mouse or by holding down the
Shift key and pressing the arrow keys. 
2. Click the Charts icon. 
A pull-down menu of different chart types appears. 
3. Click on a chart type. 
Numbers creates your chart, along with a Chart Inspector window, as
shown in Figure 8-19.
If you don’t like the chart type you chose, click in the Chart Type icon in
the Chart Inspector pane and choose a different chart type.
4. Click the Close button of the Inspector window.

To move a chart to a different sheet, follow these steps:
1. Click and drag the chart name underneath a Sheet icon of a different
sheet in the Sheet pane. 
2. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the location of
your chart. 
Numbers displays your chart on the other sheet. You may need to move
the chart to a specific location on the sheet, just to make your chart
look nicer.

Deleting text boxes, shapes and pictures
In case you want to get rid of an object, you can delete it by following these
steps:
1. In the Sheet pane, click the name of the sheet containing the object
you want to delete.
2. Click the object (text box, shape, or picture) you want to delete. 
Handles appear around your object.
3. Press the Delete key. 
Sharing Your Spreadsheet
You’ve put a lot of effort into making your spreadsheet presentable. Now’s
the time to actually present it, which usually means sharing your spread-
sheet with others by printing it out or saving it as a file.
Printing a spreadsheet
In other spreadsheet programs, you can print your spreadsheet and chart —
only to find that part of your chart or spreadsheet gets cut off by the edge of
the paper. To avoid this problem, Numbers displays a Content Slider, which
lets you magnify or shrink an entire sheet so that it fits and prints perfectly
on a page.
To shrink or magnify a sheet to print, follow these steps: 
1. In the Sheet pane, click the name of a sheet you want to print. 
2. Choose File➪Show Print View (or View➪Show Print View). 
Numbers displays a page and shows how the charts and tables on your
sheet will print, as shown in Figure 8-21.
3. Drag the Content Slider to magnify or shrink your data until it fits
exactly the way you want on the page.
The Content Slider is located at the bottom center of the Print View window.
4. Choose File➪Print (or press Ô+P). 
A dialog appears asking how many copies to print, which pages to print,
and which printer to use.
5. Choose the print options you want and click Print.

Sharing Your Spreadsheet
562
Exporting a spreadsheet
When you choose the File➪Save command, Numbers saves your spread-
sheet in its own proprietary file format. If you want to share your spread-
sheets with others, you need to export your spreadsheet into another file
format, such as:
✦PDF: Saves your spreadsheet as a series of static pages stored in the
PDF Adobe Acrobat file format that can be viewed by any computer with
a PDF viewing program.
✦Excel: Saves your spreadsheet as a Microsoft Excel file, which can be
opened and edited by any spreadsheet that can read and edit Microsoft
Excel files. 
✦CSV: Saves your spreadsheet in Comma-Separated Values format, a uni-
versal format that preserves only data, not any charts or pictures you
have stored on your spreadsheet.
The PDF file format preserves formatting 100 percent, but you’ll need extra
software to edit it. Generally, if someone needs to edit your spreadsheet,
save it as an Excel file. The CSV option is useful only for transferring your
data to another program that can’t read Excel files.

on the Mac
In This Chapter
 Understanding basic word-processor features
 Choosing a word processor
 Working with various word-processor file formats
A
word processor lets you create, save, change, and rearrange text. After
you’ve written text, a word processor can spell and grammar check
your words and format your text to make it look pretty. 
Besides arranging text, word processors can also do simple page layout 
that lets you include graphics and wrap text around these graphic images. If
you need to write long documents, word processors can keep track of page
numbering, displaying headers and footers at the top and bottom of each
page, and they even create an index automatically. If you need to work with
words, you need a word processor.
The Basic Features of Word Processing
The three basic aspects of word processing are creating a document, editing
it, and formatting it. Editing involves adding, deleting, and moving or copy-
ing text from one part of your document to another. Formatting changes the
appearance of text without changing the text itself. You can make text bigger
or smaller, underline or italicize it, and change the line spacing or paragraph
margins, to name a few formatting actions.
Creating a document and adding text
Word processor files are called documents. You can create a document from
a blank page or from a template that provides formatting, such as a newslet-
ter template that divides text into columns using a specific font and font size.
Whether you create a document from a blank page or a template, you need
to add new text wherever the cursor appears. In most programs, the cursor
appears as a vertical, blinking line that acts like a pointer. You can move the
cursor using either the keyboard or the mouse. To move the cursor, press
the up-, down-, left-, or right-arrow keys or move the mouse and click the
screen wherever you want to enter text. Then just type away!

The Basic Features of Word Processing
568
Almost every word processor offers shortcut keys that can move the cursor
to specific places in the document, such as to the beginning or end of a line
or to the next or previous word. Some common word processor shortcuts
appear in Table 1-1.

Copying or cutting text
After typing text, you can always move or copy that chunk of text to another
location. Copying text lets you place a duplicate of your selected text some-
where else; cutting text deletes the selected text and lets you move it to a
new location. You can copy or cut text by following these steps:
1. Select (highlight) the text to copy or move.
Select the text by clicking at the beginning of the text you want to select,
holding down your mouse button, dragging the pointer over the text,
and releasing the mouse button. If you prefer using the keyboard, place
the cursor at the start of the text and then hold down the Shift key while
pressing the appropriate arrow key until the text is highlighted.
2. Copy or cut the text:
• Copy: Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ô+C.
• Cut: If you want to eliminate the text where it is and move it some-
where else, choose Edit➪Cut instead, or press Ô+X. 
3. Move the cursor to the location where you want the text to appear.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô+V to place the text in its new location.
Many word processors let you quickly cut and paste text by selecting text
and then dragging it to a new location with the mouse. Similarly, you can
copy text by selecting it, holding down the Option key, and then dragging the
selected text to a new location with the mouse.

The Basic Features of Word Processing
569
Deleting text
You need to be able to erase those pesky typos or whole chunks of text.
Thankfully, a word processor lets you zap your errors out of existence. The
Mac keyboard might have two Delete keys for eliminating individual charac-
ters, as follows:
✦Pressing the big Delete key (the one that appears to the right of the +
and = key) deletes characters to the left of the cursor.
✦Pressing the small Delete key (the one that appears to the left of the End
key) deletes characters to the right of the cursor.
Not all Mac keyboards have both types of Delete keys. 
If you hold down either Delete key, you delete multiple characters.
To delete a large chunk of text, such as an entire sentence, paragraph, or
group of paragraphs, the fastest way is to select the text and then press
either Delete key.
If you delete text by mistake, choose Edit➪Undo or press Ô+Z to put it right
back. If you choose the Undo command multiple times, you can undo each
previous action one at a time.
Formatting text
Formatting text changes its appearance. For instance, you can display text in
different colors, fonts, or sizes. To format text, you must first select the text
you want to change and then choose a way to format it. Figure 1-1 shows dif-
ferent ways to format text.
To format text, you typically have two choices after you select the text you
want to modify:
Figure 1-1:

appearance.

The Basic Features of Word Processing
570
✦Click the Format menu and then choose the type of formatting such as
changing the Font.
✦Click the Format toolbar, which displays buttons for changing paragraph
justification or font size.
If you format text a certain way and suddenly decide that it looks ugly,
choose Edit➪Undo or press Ô+Z to remove the formatting and return your
text to its previous appearance.
Formatting pages
Another way to change the appearance of text is to format all or part of a
page. Formatting a page simply changes the physical location of text on the
page, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Some common page formatting options are:
✦Line spacing: Defines the space that appears between lines in a paragraph.
✦Paragraph margins: Defines the left and right edges that the text
appears in between.
✦Columns: Divides a page into vertical areas. When text fills one column,
it can flow into the next column.

Choosing a Word Processor
571
Choosing a Word Processor
Two important aspects of any word processor are its features and its compati-
bility with other programs. Features are important because one word proces-
sor might lack a feature that a different word processor offers, such as the
ability to add footnotes to a page or generate a table of contents automatically.
Compatibility is important because users often share word processor docu-
ments with other people without printing out the documents at all. Multiple
users can add comments or mark up text and then pass the revised docu-
ment to others who can see the original text and the newly added text (often
displayed in colors). 
TextEdit
If your word processing needs are simple, such as writing letters or reports
occasionally, use the free TextEdit program that comes with every Mac. Like
most commercial word processors, TextEdit provides a spelling and gram-
mar checker and can read and write to Microsoft Word documents, which
makes sharing documents much easier with others. 
Although TextEdit lacks features such as templates for reusing different page
layouts, TextEdit does offer the unusual feature of letting you type right to
left (unlike the traditional left to right). By allowing right to left typing,
TextEdit can work with foreign languages such as Hebrew.
Microsoft Word
The TextEdit word processor that comes free with every Mac might be suffi-
cient for many people, but if you need to share word-processor documents
with someone who uses Microsoft Word, you might prefer using Microsoft
Word as well. Microsoft Word isn’t necessarily the best word processor, but
it offers three features that make it a popular and often the most practical
choice for business and academic users:
✦Nearly guaranteed file compatibility with Microsoft Word users running
Windows
✦Collaboration tools that allow multiple users to add and review com-
ments written by others
✦Advanced features for creating indexes, tables, footnotes, and graphics
The biggest advantage of Microsoft Word is that so many other people use
Word on both Windows and the Mac, so sharing and collaborating with Word
files are nearly flawless. If you need to share files with others regularly, espe-
cially those using Windows or different types of programs such as desktop
publishing programs, the path of least resistance is to use Microsoft Word.

Choosing a Word Processor
572
In an effort to get everyone to buy and use Microsoft Word, Microsoft sells a
low-cost, student edition of Microsoft Office (which includes Microsoft Word).
This student edition is identical to the retail version, although the retail ver-
sion might include additional programs such as Microsoft Entourage. If you’re
a student, or the parent of one, and just want Microsoft Word, buying the
student edition can save you several hundred dollars.
Microsoft Word alternatives
Perhaps the most intriguing alternative to Microsoft Word is the free, open
source AbiWord (www.abisource.com) word processor. AbiWord offers
many advanced features such as the ability to create tables, footnotes, and
bullet lists. 
The main difference between Microsoft Word and AbiWord is that Microsoft
Word offers a huge library of templates and clip art to help you create new
documents, whereas AbiWord offers only a handful of templates. In addition,
AbiWord’s features might be similar to Microsoft Word’s, but they might not
be as polished. For example, Microsoft Word’s spelling and grammar checker
tends to catch more errors than AbiWord’s spelling and grammar checker. 
One major feature missing in AbiWord is the ability to collaborate on docu-
ments and display revision marks. Although a newer version of AbiWord will
likely offer this feature eventually, the lack or limit of collaboration tools in
AbiWord might make you stay with Microsoft Word. 
Open source is a term used to describe any program that not only is free to
use and copy but also makes its source code (the actual written instructions
used to create the program) freely available for anyone to copy, modify, 
and use.
Besides being free to use and copy, AbiWord also runs on multiple operating
systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. (Microsoft Word runs
only on Windows and Mac OS X, and the Windows version of Microsoft Word
looks and behaves slightly differently than the Mac OS X version.) If you
need a word processor that looks and acts the same on multiple operating
systems and don’t require all the features of Microsoft Word, AbiWord might
be a better choice than Word.
If you need to write in a foreign language, AbiWord even supports left-to-right
typing (useful for Hebrew or Arabic) along with spell-checking dictionaries in
30 languages. 
To maximize compatibility when sharing documents, AbiWord can also open
and save files in several popular file formats, including Microsoft Word, Rich

Chapter 1

on the Mac

573
Text Format, OpenOffice, and WordPerfect documents. With its ability to open
and save files in different formats, AbiWord lets you share documents with
others no matter which word processor they use. (As noted previously, 
all document sharing among varying programs runs the risk of some 
incompatibilities.)
Because AbiWord is free, you have nothing to lose by trying it. If it works 
for you, then keep using it. If it doesn’t do what you want, then use another
word processor. If you know anything about programming, you can even
peek at the source code and rewrite the program to make it work exactly the
way you want.
Three other popular word processors that have a small but loyal following
are Nisus (www.nisus.com), Mariner Write (www.marinersoftware.com),
and Mellel (www.redlers.com). As does AbiWord, Nisus, Mariner Write,
and Mellel offer most of the features of Microsoft Word, including the ability
to open and save files in Microsoft Word format and save different types of
formatting as reusable styles. If you don’t need all the features of Microsoft
Word, you might like Nisus, Mariner Write, or Mellel better. 
The latter three word processors focus on creating a smaller, slimmer, and
easier word processor than Microsoft Word. The main drawback is that
these three programs aren’t free, but the cost is still a fraction of the price of
Microsoft Word.
For another Microsoft Word alternative, consider Apple’s iWork, which
includes the Pages word processor, which you discover more about in Book
IV, Chapter 6.
Specialized word processors
The specialized word processors in this section can help you with particu-
lar tasks. If you have a special need, there might be a special program to fill
that need.
Ordinary word processors might be fine for writing reports and letters, but if
you need to write only certain types of documents, you might prefer a more
specialized word processor. For example, you might like Letter Star (www.
objectpark.net), which makes writing letters easy, especially if you need
to write form letters. Just type your letter and specify where to insert some-
one’s name, address, or other custom information, and Letter Star can print
form letters. Although other word processors offer the ability to create form
letters and insert data such as names and addresses (known as mail-merge),
Letter Star simplifies the process.

Choosing a Word Processor

For aspiring authors, Z-Write (www.stonetablesoftware.com) offers a
combination outliner and word processor. By helping you organize your writ-
ing into parts, such as chapters for novelists or scenes for a screenwriter, 
Z-Write helps keep your ideas organized and divides a larger idea into small
pieces to make tackling a large project much easier.
Screenplays, teleplays, or stage plays require proper formatting, and if you’d
rather not worry about all those details, you can use a specialized script-
writing word processor such as Final Draft (www.finaldraft.com), Movie
Magic Screenwriter (www.screenplay.com), or Montage (www.mariner
software.com). These programs can automatically format your script as
you type. 
Final Draft, Movie Magic Screenwriter, and Montage cost money, but you can
grab a copy of the free, open source scriptwriting program called Celtx
(www.celtx.com), shown in Figure 1-3. As do most open source programs,
Celtx runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, so if you use other operating
systems regularly, Celtx might be your only choice. (Final Draft and Movie
Magic Screenwriter run on both Windows and Mac OS X; Montage runs only
on Mac OS X.)

Word Processor File Formats
575
Word Processor File Formats
Although most word processors work the same, they all tend to store docu-
ments in different file formats. Most word processors can open and save files
that other word processors can use as well, but any time you share docu-
ments between two different word processors (even two different versions
of the same word processor), you risk the chance that one word processor
won’t be able to use the files created by another word processor.
Also, just to let you know, there isn’t a TextEdit format. TextEdit uses other
common file formats.
The Microsoft Word .doc and .docx format
Originally, every word processor created its own file format to lock cus-
tomers into using that particular word processor. That’s the reason why so
many people use Microsoft Word. It’s not that people love Microsoft Word
(they don’t) or that Microsoft Word is the best word processor available (it
isn’t). It’s just that so many people use Microsoft Word that if you need to
share word processor documents with others, it’s much easier just to use
Microsoft Word, too. 
The newest version of Microsoft Word, Word 2008 on the Mac, uses a file
format with the extension .docx, which is based on XML (eXtensible
Markup Language). Although this file format is fairly new, many word proces-
sors (such as Microsoft Word, Pages ’08, and TextEdit) can now open and
edit a .docx file format. 
Earlier versions of Microsoft Word used a different file format, with the
extension .doc — the unofficial “standard” for sharing word processor doc-
uments. Other word processors can also open, edit, and save .doc files, but
they sometimes mess up the formatting in tables, headers, or footnotes. 
Older versions of Microsoft Word cannot open the Word 2008 .docx files.
However, Microsoft (www.microsoft.com) offers a free Microsoft Office
Open XML File Format Converter, which can take files stored in the .docx
format and convert them into the older .doc format. 
RTF (Rich Text Format) files
Not all word processors can open and display Microsoft Word files, so
Microsoft created a word processor file format “standard” called Rich Text
Format (RTF) files. The main purpose of the RTF file format is to allow word
processors to share documents while retaining all formatting. 

Word Processor File Formats
576
Because Microsoft has published the RTF file format for anyone to read and
study, nearly every word processor can reliably read, write, and edit any
documents stored in RTF files. For nearly guaranteed compatibility between
different word processors, use RTF files to share documents. 
For maximum file compatibility, the free TextEdit program that comes with
every Mac can read and write RTF and Microsoft Word .doc files. 
Text (ASCII) files
An even older standard for sharing documents between word processors 
is called text or ASCII files. The main difference between text and RTF files 
is that RTF files can retain formatting of text whereas text files contain only
text, with no formatting whatsoever. Every word processor can use text 
files, but if you need to share documents that contain formatting, stick with
RTF files. 
One reason to share documents as text files is if you need to share a docu-
ment with a really old computer and word processor that can’t recognize
RTF files. Another reason to use text files is when you need to take a word
processor document and pour it into a desktop publishing program or other
program. 
Open Document (.odf) files
One of the newest standards for word processor documents is called the
Open Document format (.odf). The idea behind Open Document is to pro-
vide a format that retains complex formatting (such as tables, indexes,
charts, and bullet lists) but whose technical specifications are kept publicly
available. This way, anyone can create a word processor that can read, edit,
and save documents in the Open Document format. (The Open Document
format is the standard file format used by the free OpenOffice suite, which
you can find out about in Book V, Chapter 2.)
Although the Open Document standard isn’t in widespread use, it’s likely to
grow in popularity. To maintain compatibility with Open Document files, it’s
a good idea to check if your word processor can save, edit, and create Open
Document files as well.
Several countries (France, Belgium, Norway, Japan, Finland, and Germany)
are now pushing to store official publications in a universal file format, 
such as Open Document, for guaranteed accessibility in the future. For more
information about the Open Document standard, visit OASIS (Organization
for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) at www.
oasis-open.org.

Web page (HTML) files
You can use many word processors as simple Web page editors by saving
documents in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format, which is
used by Web sites to display text and graphics in a Web browser. The HTML
file format is best for turning word processor documents into Web pages but
can also be used for sharing documents between different word processors. 
Although HTML is a file format standard publicly available to anyone who
cares to read the technical specifications for creating and storing data in an
HTML file, every word processor tends to save, open, and edit HTML files in
different ways. So it’s possible to create an HTML file that looks perfect in
one word processor, but when opened in a different word processor (or Web
page editor), that same HTML file might look skewed. 
Portable Document Format (PDF) files
In the old days, sharing meant storing a document in a file format that
another word processor could open. If two people used different word
processors, there was a chance that they couldn’t share documents, even if
they only wanted to look at the document but not edit it.
To address this problem, Adobe created a universal file format for displaying
documents called PDF or Adobe Acrobat files. A PDF file acts like a printed
version of your document, except that it’s stored in an electronic file (which
you can, of course, print).
The Mac can view the contents of an PDF file using its Preview program. Users
of other computers must view the contents of a PDF file using a special PDF
reader, such as the free Adobe Acrobat Reader program (www.adobe.com).
Because the Adobe Acrobat Reader program runs on several different oper-
ating systems (including Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux), some word proces-
sors, such as Pages ’08, let you save documents in the PDF file format so that
you can share your document with anyone.
PDF files preserve the exact appearance of your document. For that reason,
PDF files are great for sharing files that you want others to read but don’t
want others to modify (although they still can with the right program, such
as Acrobat Pro). That’s why the government distributes tax forms as PDF
files and many companies publish press releases in this format. 
If you’re more concerned about letting others view your document but not
necessary edit it, share it as a PDF file. If you want others to edit your docu-
ment, store it in another file format, such as RTF, instead.

Converting File Formats
578
Converting File Formats
Every word processor chooses a default file format to save your documents,
although you can always change this file format at any time, as shown in
Figure 1-4. 
If you need to share files between different word processors, you have two
choices. First, you can change the default file format used by your word
processor. If you need to share documents, both of you could agree to use a
specific file format (such as RTF) and save your files in that format.
A second solution is to save your documents in the default file format of
your word processor and then save a second copy of your document in a dif-
ferent file format. To save an existing document in a different file format, the
general steps are as follows:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
A Save As dialog appears.
2. Click the pop-up menu that defines a file format for saving documents.
A list of different formats appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
3. Choose the file format you want to use.
4. Click Save.

If you need to use documents stored in different file formats, you might want a
dedicated file-conversion program such as MacLink Plus (www.dataviz.com).
In contrast to a word processor that can typically open and save documents
in only a handful of different file formats, MacLink Plus can convert and save
documents stored in dozens of different file formats, including obscure file
formats such as WordStar, MultiMate, OfficeWriter, WriteNow, and ClarisWorks/
AppleWorks. 
With so many different word processors available, take your time to find the
one you like best. As long as you’re happy with your word processor, it doesn’t
really matter what anyone else uses.

ost businesses rely on word processors, spreadsheet applications,
and presentation programs to do most of the heavy lifting for essen-
tial office functions. Instead of buying these programs separately, most
people buy them in sets known as office suites. Besides costing less than
buying the programs individually, office suite programs are designed to
work together. Not only can you share data among all programs in an office
suite, but each office suite program uses similar menus and commands. 
Although many people are familiar with word processors (if not, refer to
Book V, Chapter 1), fewer people understand the purpose and advantages 
of spreadsheets and presentation programs. The first part of this chapter
briefly describes what these two programs do and why you might want to
use them.
Understanding Spreadsheets
Word processors are great for manipulating text, but when you need to
manipulate (or crunch) numbers to balance your budget, you need a spread-
sheet. Think of a spreadsheet like a super calculator. Just feed a spreadsheet
4 or 4,000 numbers, and it happily crunches (adds, subtracts, multiplies,
and divides) them quickly and accurately.
To make a spreadsheet calculate numbers, you need to create and store 
formulas in the spreadsheet. Formulas can be as simple as adding several
numbers or as complicated as solving a third-order differential equation; 
the choice is yours. 
Even better, spreadsheets let you examine your formulas so you can spot
errors in the formulas or in the numbers you’re feeding into the formula.

Understanding Spreadsheets
582
Such error-checking lets you create and calculate spreadsheets with a speed
and accuracy not possible with a calculator or adding machine.
The parts of a spreadsheet
Every spreadsheet consists of a grid that consists of rows and columns. The
intersection of a row and column forms a block called a cell, as shown in
Figure 2-1.
When you type numbers into a spreadsheet, you always type them into a
cell, which are aligned in rows and columns (refer to Figure 2-1).
Two types of data you can type in a spreadsheet are numbers and text. Numbers
can represent anything, such as quantities or measurements. Text typically
identifies what your data represents, as in the following:
Sales Person
Weekly Sales
Sally May
$648.20
Bob Jones
$710.54
Derek Kale
$609.86
Mary Sands
$448.25

Chapter 2
Office Suites 
on the Mac
Understanding Spreadsheets
583
At the simplest level, a spreadsheet lets you organize numbers and text labels
in rows and columns. However, the heart of any spreadsheet is its formulas,
which can calculate results based on the numbers stored in different cells.
Any cell can contain a formula. A formula can be as simple as adding two
numbers or as complicated as multiplying 4,000 numbers. You can type a for-
mula in a cell and then edit it later using the Formula Bar (refer to Figure 2-1). 
Calculating results with formulas
A formula is a special type of text that tells the computer how to use num-
bers, stored in different cells, to calculate a new result. Although a formula
can define specific numbers to calculate (such as 23 + 76.09), the real power
of a spreadsheet comes from defining which cells to calculate. Because you
can type different numbers into a cell, changing a number in a cell feeds dif-
ferent data into a formula.
A cell reference identifies a specific cell by its column heading (a letter) and
row heading (a number), as shown in Figure 2-2.
If you want a formula to use a number stored in a specific cell, you have to
use cell references in your formula, such as
= B2 + E4
This formula tells the spreadsheet, “Take the number stored in cell B2 and
add it to the number stored in cell E4. Then display the results in the cell
where you typed this formula.”
By using cell references rather than actual numbers, formulas can always
calculate the same type of results (addition, subtraction) no matter what
numbers you store in different cells. 
By combining addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication in various
ways, you can create even the most complicated formulas, such as determin-
ing the monthly payments on a loan that charges a fixed interest rate every
Figure 2-2:
Every cell
can be
identified by

and row
headings.

Understanding Spreadsheets
584
year over a ten-year period. To spare you the trouble of creating commonly
used formulas, such as calculating logarithms or interest rates, most spread-
sheet programs include prebuilt formulas called functions. By using func-
tions, you can make a spreadsheet calculate the most complicated formulas
to solve any mathematical problem.
Formatting text and numbers
After you’ve entered some numbers and created formulas to manipulate
those numbers, you can format your spreadsheet to make it look nicer or
present your data more effectively. By shading column I, this spreadsheet
makes numbers displayed in that column easier to find and read. By shading
rows 9 and 13, the spreadsheet helps separate data, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Besides formatting text, you can also format numbers. Formatting numbers
can include defining how many decimal places appear; whether to use
commas to separate the digits of a large number; whether to display num-
bers with currency signs; and whether to display negative numbers in red or
in parentheses.
To change the formatting of one or more cells, you need to open a dialog. In
Excel, you can right-click one or more cells and choose Format Cells to dis-
play the dialog as shown in Figure 2-4. In Numbers, you need to select one or
more cells and choose View➪Show Inspector to see a similar dialog.
In the dialog in Figure 2-4, you first need to select a category that defines the
type of data that you want to format, such as numbers or currency. Then you
need to select specific options for each type of formatting. For example,
selecting the Numbers category lets you choose how many decimal places
Figure 2-3:

text, rows,
and columns

different
elements
stand out.

Book V
Chapter 2
Office Suites 
on the Mac

585
to display, but selecting the Currency category offers a different option that
lets you choose the type of currency symbol to display.
Formatting is never necessary, but it can make your spreadsheet easier to
read and understand. 
Making numbers meaningful with charts
Staring with a spreadsheet loaded with rows and columns of numbers can
seem like driving in a heavy fog. What are you supposed to be seeing in
those numbers? Are those sales figures going up or down, and by how
much? But translate your numbers into pie, bar, or line charts, and presto! It
all seems so much clearer now. Figure 2-5 shows some types of charts that
you can create in standard spreadsheet programs.
To create a chart, you must select the cells containing the data you want to
show in your chart, which includes the actual numbers along with labels
that identify what those numbers represent such as sales per month. Then
you can choose the type of chart you want to create. To display the dialog in
Figure 2-5 using Excel, you can just click a Chart Wizard button. In Numbers,
you can choose a chart by clicking a Chart button.
Charts help you spot trends that would be impossible to identify just by
looking at lists of numbers. For example, a pie chart can show you which
sales people account for the largest amount of income, and a line chart can
show you which sales person has been gradually increasing (or decreasing)
sales over time.

Understanding Presentation Programs
586
Understanding Presentation Programs
In the old days, giving a presentation often meant printing text and graphics
on a transparent sheet of plastic and slapping it on an overhead projector.
Obviously, this method of presenting information was clumsy and tedious.
Not only did you have to print everything on transparent plastic sheets, but
you had to keep them in the right order. If you needed to make any changes,
you’d have to print a new transparent sheet all over again. 
Presentation programs solve this problem by making it easy to create and
edit a presentation, even at the last minute. Plus you can include animation,
sound, or movies, which is impossible to do with static transparencies on an
overhead projector. 
Every presentation consists of one or more slides, with a slide typically dis-
playing a single chunk of information. So the first slide of a presentation
might display a brief introduction identifying the speaker or the topic of the
presentation. The second slide might explain how sales results are going
down, and a third slide might display a list of ideas for increasing sales. 
Displaying text
Text can appear by itself on a slide or combined with a graphic image, such
as a pie chart. Text generally consists of a heading and brief supporting items
such as bullet points, as shown in the PowerPoint screen in Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-5:
Charts can

Book V
Chapter 2

Understanding Presentation Programs
587
As do word processor programs, presentation programs let you format text
to use different fonts, change the font size, or display text in color. 
Format your text in ways that make it easier to read, especially for people
sitting in the back of the room watching your presentation. For instance,
make sure the text is large enough, and if you color your text, make sure it
contrasts with the background (using light-colored text on a dark back-
ground, and vice versa). 
Displaying graphics
A presentation that consists entirely of text can often get monotonous. To
keep people from falling asleep, spruce up your presentation with graphics.
You might, for example, sprinkle informative images, such as pie or bar charts,
throughout your slide show. You can also use purely decorative graphics,
such as a company logo. (See Figure 2-7 for a graphic displayed in PowerPoint.)
Things can really get interesting when you animate your graphics. A simple,
static line chart can show how sales are rising or falling, but it’s much more
dramatic to watch an animated line chart change before your eyes.
Besides cartoon images, graphics can also include actual still photographs
or video. If you were giving a presentation in front of advertising executives,
you could play a short video of a competitor’s TV commercial, concluding
with a demo video of your own commercial. By adding animation and video,
presentation programs can become more compelling and convincing.

Spicing up presentations with transitions
If your presentation doesn’t use or need video or animated graphics, you can
still spice up your presentation by using transitions. A transition can ani-
mate the way text appears on a slide or how each slide appears.
Adding a transition to text can make your text drop in place, one letter at a
time, or swirl around the screen before settling into place. Like formatting
text, adding transitions to text is meant to highlight your message and make
it more interesting for people to read.
Transitions can make individual slides more interesting to watch as well.
Instead of having one slide disappear and another one appear in its place, a
transition can make one slide dissolve and reveal the next slide underneath.
Such slide transitions are meant to capture the audience’s attention and
make your entire presentation visually interesting. (Now all you have to
worry about is making it informative and useful.)
When using transitions, don’t get carried away. Too many transitions can get
more distracting than entertaining, so use transitions sparingly.
Rearranging slides
Perhaps most important, presentation programs let you rearrange your
slides easily, making it possible to create a presentation and customize it for
different audiences. For example, if you’re presenting to a group of engineers
Figure 2-7:
Enliven your

with
graphics.

Book V
Chapter 2

589
and scientists, you might add more slides displaying technically oriented
information. If you had to give that same presentation to a group of investors
and business executives, you could simply skip over the technically oriented
slides without having to delete them. 
Comparing Office Suites
Office suites typically bundle several programs that offer the most common
features you’ll need for personal or business use. The most common office
suite is Microsoft Office. Because Microsoft Office is so popular on Windows,
using Microsoft Office for the Mac allows you to share files easily with little
risk of file incompatibilities.
Choosing an office suite often boils down to these factors: 
✦Compatibility: If you need to share files with others, you need maximum
file compatibility. Identify the office suite being used by people who you
need to share files with. Then use the same office suite that these people
are using. If you don’t want to use that office suite, look for a similar
office suite that can work with files created by other office suites. 
✦Cost: The cost of an office suite can also influence your decision 
because some office suites cost nearly as much as a new computer
(Microsoft Office). 
✦Features: Look at the features offered by each program in the office
suite. Although office suites tend to offer similar features, they always
offer something different, either a feature that a competing office suite
doesn’t offer or a slicker way of doing something that another office
suite does.
One of the newest office suites available is iWork, which you can read about
in Book IV, Chapters 6, 7, and 8.
If you already have a word processor but just need a spreadsheet, consider
getting Mesa (www.plsys.com), which is a low-cost ($34) spreadsheet
that’s designed to be simpler to use than other spreadsheets.
Microsoft Office
The most popular office suite is Microsoft Office, which includes Microsoft
Word (word processor), Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet), Microsoft PowerPoint
(presentation program), and Microsoft Entourage (e-mail and personal
organizer program).

Comparing Office Suites
590
If you’re switching over from a Windows computer, you might already be
familiar with Microsoft Office, so getting the Mac version will make the tran-
sition from Windows to the Mac that much easier. 
One drawback of Microsoft Office is that it offers so many features that the
programs can be hard to learn and use. If you just need an office suite for
personal use, Microsoft Office can do the job in much the same way that a
baseball bat can do the job of a fly swatter. For many people, Microsoft
Office offers way more features than they’ll ever need, so if you fit into this
category, you might want to consider some alternatives.
ThinkFree Office
One of the more interesting alternatives to Microsoft Office is a competing
office suite dubbed ThinkFree Office (www.thinkfree.com), which is offered
in two versions: a desktop version and an online version.
The desktop version of the ThinkFree office suite includes a word processor,
spreadsheet, and presentation program that can open, edit, and save docu-
ments in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint formats. 
The drawback of ThinkFree Office is that it doesn’t work 100 percent exactly
like Microsoft Office, and there’s always the possibility that ThinkFree Office
won’t be able to open and display complex Microsoft Office documents 
correctly. However, if you don’t need all the features of Microsoft Office and
don’t create complicated documents, ThinkFree Office is the perfect low-
cost alternative.
For an even better alternative, try the free online version of ThinkFree Office,
shown in Figure 2-8. Unlike the desktop version, which requires you to install
the programs on your Mac, the online version of ThinkFree Office works
entirely through your Web browser. As long as you have a fast and reliable
Internet connection, you can create, edit, and save files using ThinkFree
Office anywhere in the world. 
Of course, if you don’t have access to an Internet connection, you won’t be
able to edit documents using the online ThinkFree, so you might still want to
buy the desktop version of ThinkFree when you need to work without an
Internet connection.
ThinkFree even offers a special portable edition of its ThinkFree Show pres-
entation program. This portable edition lets you create, edit, and save pre-
sentations on your iPod so that you can carry and give your presentations
through your iPod rather than lug your laptop Mac around.

Google Docs & Spreadsheets
For another free, online office suite, try Google Docs & Spreadsheets (www.
google.com), which lets you use a Microsoft Word– and Excel-compatible
program to write documents and create spreadsheets using any computer
that has an Internet connection and a browser. Figure 2-9 shows a Google
spreadsheet in action. 
If you need to collaborate on word processor documents or spread-
sheets with others, ordinary office suites force you to e-mail files back and
forth. With Google Docs & Spreadsheets, you and another person can 
collaborate on a word processor document or spreadsheet file online in 
real time.
As with the online version of ThinkFree Office, Google Docs & Spreadsheets
is useless if you don’t have an Internet connection, but if you do most of
your creating and editing at a computer hooked up to the Internet, Google
Docs & Spreadsheets is another free alternative to Microsoft Office.

NeoOffice and OpenOffice
If the free, online version of ThinkFree Office appeals to you but you don’t
want to rely on the Internet to create and edit your documents, consider the
free, open source NeoOffice (www.neooffice.org) and OpenOffice
(www.openoffice.org). OpenOffice is an open source project to create a
free office suite that runs under the Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. Best of all,
OpenOffice includes a wealth of programs specifically designed for business
use including:
✦OpenOffice Writer (word processor)
✦OpenOffice Calc (spreadsheet)
✦OpenOffice Impress (presentation program)
✦OpenOffice Base (database program)
✦OpenOffice Draw (drawing program)
Although OpenOffice Writer, Calc, and Impress mimic Microsoft Word, Excel,
and PowerPoint, respectively, OpenOffice Base is a relational database simi-
lar to Microsoft Access, which is available only on Windows computers.
Relational databases let you store large amounts of data and are used by
many businesses to track inventory or manage customer lists. OpenOffice
Figure 2-9:

Draw is a vector drawing program, similar to CorelDRAW or Adobe Illustrator,
which lets you draw organizational charts or flowcharts. 
OpenOffice is a free version of a commercial office suite called StarOffice,
developed and marketed by Sun Microsystems (www.sun.com). If you need
technical support, you can buy the commercial version of StarOffice, which
is identical to OpenOffice.
One glaring flaw of OpenOffice is that its current version runs on X11, which
is a windowing system designed for the Unix operating system, which is
what Mac OS X is based on. As a result, installing and running OpenOffice on
a Mac requires technical expertise, which might scare novices away from
OpenOffice. 
The OpenOffice programmers are working to create a native Mac version of
OpenOffice, which might be available by the time you read this.
Since OpenOffice originally did not run on the Mac, a separate team of pro-
grammers took it upon themselves to develop their own Mac version of
OpenOffice, which they dubbed NeoOffice.
NeoOffice is identical to OpenOffice except that NeoOffice runs only on 
the Mac. If you want to run OpenOffice and don’t want to wait for an official
Mac version of OpenOffice to be developed someday, grab a free copy of
NeoOffice instead. Figure 2-10 shows the presentation program that’s part of
the NeoOffice suite. Just think of NeoOffice as OpenOffice but with the
friendly Mac user interface.

RagTime
One unusual business suite is called RagTime (www.ragtime-online.com).
In contrast to most office suites, which offer a word processor, spreadsheet,
and presentation program, RagTime provides a word processor, spread-
sheet, and desktop publishing program. The reason for this is that RagTime
focuses on helping you create printed business reports. 
By using RagTime’s word processor to create text and its spreadsheet to cal-
culate numeric results, you can easily transfer this information into RagTime’s
desktop publishing program to create reports that would be difficult to
create in a word processor. 
Best of all, if you make any changes in your word processor or spreadsheet,
RagTime immediately updates those changes as they appear in your desktop
publishing document. In this way, RagTime ensures that your desktop pub-
lishing document will always contain the latest information automatically.
Although RagTime is relatively expensive ($495), the price might be worth it
if you need to create business reports on a regular basis.
MarinerPak
For a low-cost, simple office suite, consider MarinerPak (www.mariner
software.com), which combines Mariner Write (a word processor) with
Mariner Calc (a spreadsheet). Mariner Write can open, edit, and save
Microsoft Word documents, and Mariner Calc can open, edit, and save
Microsoft Excel files. 
Although not as full featured as Microsoft Word or Excel, both Mariner Write
and Mariner Calc are far easier to use and less expensive as well ($89.95). If
Databases
Although most office suites don’t include a
database, most businesses need the ability 
to store, sort, and retrieve data. Currently, 
the most popular database for the Mac is
FileMaker (www.filemaker.com), which
has long been acknowledged as one of the
easiest database programs to use on any per-
sonal computer. A simpler version of FileMaker,
sold by the same company, is called Bento.
Another popular database program available
for the Mac is 4th Dimension (www.4d.com).
Although not as easy to use as FileMaker, 4th
Dimension is a hit with programmers who want
to create their own custom databases.

you’re looking for a word processor and spreadsheet that won’t leave your
scratching your head or pulling out hair, you might find MarinerPak to be
just what you’re looking for.
Office Suite File Formats
Because Microsoft Office is the most popular office suite, nearly every office
suite can open, edit, and save to Microsoft Office file formats. The Microsoft
Word file format uses the .doc extension, Excel uses .xls, and PowerPoint
uses .ppt.
The 2007 version of Microsoft Office uses a new file format with the exten-
sion .docx (Word), .xlsx (Excel), and .pptx (PowerPoint), respectively.
Not all office suites can open, edit, and save to these new file formats yet, so
if you need to be able to open documents with these new file formats, make
sure to obtain an office suite that ‘s compatible. 
Although the Microsoft Office file formats are the most popular for storing
data, office suites actually use many other file formats. Most of these other
file formats are designed to retain compatibility with older programs, but if
you need to use data trapped in these file formats, make sure your office
suite knows how to use them.
See Book V, Chapter 1 for more information about word processor file formats.
Spreadsheet file formats
Because so many people use Microsoft Excel, its .xls file format has
become the de facto standard spreadsheet file format for transferring infor-
mation. As is the Microsoft Word .doc format, the Excel .xls format is pro-
prietary, which means that a complicated spreadsheet file might not appear
correctly in another spreadsheet.
A last-resort file format is known as comma-separated value format (.csv).
Basically, a .csv file just stores the data without retaining any of its format-
ting. To separate data, .csv files use commas. This is a universal spread-
sheet file format, which means that every spreadsheet can open and create
.csv files.
To prevent spreadsheet data from ultimately getting trapped in file formats
that fall out of use, an open source standard for spreadsheets has been
developed called Open Document Spreadsheets (.ods). Although not in
widespread use, expect more spreadsheets to start offering the ability to
open, edit, and save spreadsheets in the OpenDocument format. 

Office Suite File Formats

Presentation file formats
The dominant presentation file format is Microsoft PowerPoint (which uses
the .ppt extension). In contrast to word processor documents or spread-
sheet files, presentations rarely contain data that you might need to save
and reuse in the future. As a result, most presentation programs can import
and export PowerPoint files, but they might use their own proprietary file
format to store the presentations.
To define a universal presentation file format standard, there’s an
OpenDocument standard for presentations (.odp). Although not in wide-
spread use yet, expect more presentation programs to offer the ability to
open and save presentations in the OpenDocument format. 
Generally, the simplest way to avoid dealing with different file formats is to
use the exact same programs that everyone else is using, which usually
means using Microsoft Office. However, if absolute compatibility with others
isn’t important or you’re willing to deal with the occasional hassle of incom-
patible files, you can find plenty of alternative office suites that can turn
your Mac into a business productivity tool.

T
he Mac is best known for its graphics capabilities. Although many com-
panies, such as Adobe, sell virtually identical graphics programs for
both Mac and Windows computers, the vast majority of professional artists
and graphics designers prefer the Mac. 
One common way to play with graphics is to modify an existing image. Many
people capture pictures using a digital camera and then touch up those pic-
tures using a graphics editing program.
Another way to use graphics is to create an image from scratch. Creating
graphics from scratch isn’t necessarily difficult — it’s just time-consuming.
As a result, creating graphics is the realm of most professionals, whereas
editing graphics is commonly used by both amateurs and professionals.
Understanding Painting versus Drawing
The two types of graphics programs are painting and drawing programs.
The main difference between these two forms of graphics lies with the way
they create, edit, and display pictures.
A painting program draws pictures using individual dots called pixels. A
single picture can consist of thousands of individual pixels. By changing the
color of these pixels, you can change the appearance of an image. 
Pictures made up of pixels are also called raster images. When you take a
picture with a digital camera, your camera stores that picture as a raster
image. If you capture a picture using a scanner, your scanner saves that

Understanding Painting versus Drawing

image as a raster picture too. The most popular raster-editing program is
Adobe Photoshop.
The biggest disadvantage of raster images is that you can’t resize them. The
more you enlarge a raster image, the grainier and chunkier it gets, as shown
in Figure 3-1. 
The alternative to a painting program is a drawing program. Drawing pro-
grams store pictures as vector graphics. Whereas a raster image physically
draws an image on the screen, vector graphics store images as mathematical
equations that define how to display an image on the screen.
A vector graphics picture consists of multiple items called primitives, such
as points, lines, curves, and shapes. A mathematical equation tells the com-
puter where to place items and how wide, tall, or long or what color to dis-
play each item. As a result, vector graphics generally don’t display the
subtle details that a raster image does, but vector graphics can be resized
without ever losing their resolution, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Vector graphics typically consist of separate items that you can modify and
manipulate individually. This gives vector graphics more of a cartoon look
than a realistic image. Because the resolution of vector graphics remains
sharp no matter how large you make the picture or what resolution you use
to display the image on a screen, vector graphics are used in many Web page
advertisements and animated movies. One popular vector graphics program
is Adobe Flash.

Many companies sell libraries of clip art images that you can use to spice up
a document or desktop publishing file. Sometimes these clip art images are
vector images, which let you resize them without degrading their appear-
ance, but sometimes these clip art images are raster images, which means
resizing them can make them look grainy.
Common Raster-Editing Features
Editing involves a two-step process. First, you must select the item you want to
modify. Second, you have to choose a command to modify your selected item.
In most programs, such as a word processor or a spreadsheet, you can
easily select text by dragging the mouse. In a graphics program, selecting
parts of a picture can be much harder because, in contrast to text, there isn’t
always a clear boundary of what to choose. When looking at a digital photo-
graph of a man, how can you tell the computer to select just the man’s face
but not his mustache or hat? Computers see every raster image as just as
series of colored pixels, so selecting which pixels you want to manipulate
can be tricky.
To help you select all or part of an image, raster-editing programs offer dif-
ferent types of tools that usually appear as icons in a group known as a tool-
box, as shown in Figure 3-3. By selecting the right tool, you can use the
mouse to select and manipulate a picture in different ways.
Figure 3-2:

them.

Common Raster-Editing Features

The toolbox shown in Figure 3-3 comes from Photoshop Elements, but other
graphics programs will likely display different tool icons in different positions. 
Selecting an entire picture
The simplest way to select a raster image is to select an entire image by
pressing Ô+A. (In some programs, you can also choose this command by
choosing Edit➪Select All or just Select➪All.)
After you select an entire picture, you can modify that entire picture by
rotating, making it lighter or darker, increasing/decreasing its contrast, and
converting a color picture black and white.
Many raster-editing programs also offer a Select Invert command. So if you
want to select a large area of a picture except for a small region in the middle,
it’s actually easier to select the small region in the middle first. Then you can
choose the Select Invert command, and you’ll actually select the large region
that you want.
Selecting an area
Instead of selecting a whole picture, you can also select just part of a pic-
ture. You can’t select part of a picture until you first choose a selection tool,
which typically appears in a toolbox (refer to Figure 3-3).
One of the simplest ways to select part of a picture is to select a rectangular
or elliptical area. To select a rectangular or circular part of a picture, follow
these steps:
1. Click the rectangular or elliptical selection tool in the Toolbox and
move the pointer over the part of the picture you want to select.

2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse.
The selection tool draws a dotted line, called a marquee, around your
selected item, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Selecting an irregular shape
The problem with the rectangular and elliptical selection tools is that the
part that you want to edit will almost never be perfectly rectangular or ellip-
tical. Because images in a picture are often irregularly shaped (think of the
shape of a man’s face in a digital photograph), most raster-editing programs
offer a special tool called a Lasso tool.
The Lasso tool lets you drag the mouse and draw the boundaries of the area
you want to select by dragging the mouse, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-4:

Variations of the Lasso Tool
Although the Lasso tool can select irregular
shapes, it can also be clumsy to use because it
requires a steady hand to drag the mouse
exactly where you want to select part of a pic-
ture. To compensate for this, some programs
offer two varieties of the Lasso Tool called the
Polygonal Lasso tool and the Magnetic Lasso
tool.
The Polygonal Lasso tool lets you point and
click to draw straight lines. By letting you click
the mouse around an area, the Polygonal Lasso
tool makes it easy to select an irregularly
shaped part of a picture.
The Magnetic Lasso tool lets you drag the
mouse around an area, but it’s smart enough to
detect contrast differences between different
parts of a picture. So rather than force you to
drag the mouse exactly around a selected area
in a picture, the Magnetic Lasso tool lets you
drag the mouse approximately near an area
you want to select, and the Magnetic Lasso tool
automatically selects the boundary of an area.

Common Raster-Editing Features
602
Selecting with the Magic Wand
Dragging the mouse to select an area might still be difficult, especially if the
item you want to select consists of multiple irregular shapes like a tree
branch. In cases like this, it might be easier to select the color of a picture by
using the Magic Wand tool.
The Magic Wand tool selects adjacent pixels based on color. So if you want
to select the blue sky behind a tree, you can click the Magic Wand tool and
then click the blue sky. The Magic Wand tool would automatically select the
blue pixels that you clicked, along with any adjacent blue pixels. By adjust-
ing the sensitivity of the Magic Wand tool, you can make it select more or
fewer pixels. If you select the Magic Wand tool and click the black portion of
a picture, you select all adjacent black areas as shown in Figure 3-6.
Erasing pixels
One common way to modify a picture is to erase part of it, which you can 
do by using the Eraser tool. When you choose the Eraser tool, you can drag
the mouse over a picture and wipe out all pixels underneath, as shown in
Figure 3-7. 
By changing the shape and size of the eraser tool, you can trim away parts of
a picture without erasing the parts that you want to keep. For added flexibil-
ity, many raster-editing programs offer a Magic Eraser tool. Like the Magic
Wand tool, which selects an area based on similar colors, the Magic Eraser
tool erases adjacent pixels that contain similar colors.

Using the paint brush and paint bucket
Rather than erase part of your picture, you might want to color pixels. By
changing the color of pixels, you can change the appearance of an image,
such as creating a third eye on someone’s forehead or coloring in a tear in a
scanned photograph to make the tear disappear.
To color pixels, raster-editing programs offer a Paint Brush and Paint Bucket
tool. The Paint Brush tool lets you use the pointer as a brush by clicking and
dragging the mouse.

604
If you need to paint a large area, dragging the mouse with the Paint Brush
tool can get tedious, so raster-editing programs offer a Paint Bucket tool,
which colors in any enclosed area. To use the Paint Bucket tool, just click it
in the Toolbox and then click the color that you want to use. Next, click the
part of your picture that you want to color and your chosen color floods that
part of your picture as if you spilled a bucket of paint over it. 
As an alternative to clicking a color, many raster-editing programs off a spe-
cial Eyedropper tool. The purpose of the Eyedropper tool is to let you choose
an existing color in your picture. After you click a color in your picture, the
Paint Brush or Paint Bucket tool can use that to color another area. 
Common Vector-Editing Features
Unlike raster-editing programs that modify individual pixels, vector graphics–
editing programs modify objects. To create a picture, a vector graphic program
gives you various tools for drawing different types of objects, called primitives.
Some common primitive objects are lines, curves, and points. 
After you create a picture using primitive objects, you can modify those
primitives using a variety of tools that scale (enlarge or shrink) or reshape
those primitives.
Moving and resizing objects with the Selection tool
Vector graphics consist of multiple objects. When you use the Selection tool,
you can move or resize one or more objects by selecting them with a
Selection tool and then dragging them with the mouse. To use the Selection
tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Selection tool, which usually appears as a dark arrow
pointer, in the toolbox.
2. Click an object you want to modify, such as a line.
Handles appear around your object, as shown in Figure 3-8, which dis-
plays the EazyDraw program.
3. (Optional) To move your selected object, move the pointer over your
selected object, hold the mouse button, and drag the mouse.
Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new location of
your object.
4. (Optional) To resize your selected object, move the pointer over a
handle, hold down the mouse button, and drag the mouse.
Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of your
object.

After selecting an object with the Selection tool, you can press Delete if you
want to remove that selected object.
Reshaping an object with the Direct Selection tool
Rather than move or change the size of an object, you might want to modify
the shape of an object, which you can change using the Direct Selection 
tool. This tool often appears as a white arrow pointer directly underneath
the Selection tool icon in the toolbox.
When you click an object with the Direct Selection tool, that object displays
anchor points and direction points. Anchor points appear as squares directly
on an object. By dragging an anchor point, you can reshape an object.
Direction points appear as lines with a circle or point on each end. By drag-
ging a direction point, you can reshape the curve of an object. Figure 3-9
shows an image displayed in the Intaglio drawing program.

Vector graphics programs sometimes use different terms to describe identi-
cal items. For example, Adobe Illustrator uses the term Direct Selection tool;
another program might call it a Point Selection tool. Just remember that the
names might be different, but the functions remain the same.
To use the Direct Selection tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Direct Selection tool, which usually appears as a white
arrow pointer, in the toolbox.
2. Click an object you want to modify, such as a line.
Anchor and direction points appear on your chosen object.

Drawing lines
To create lines, vector graphics programs typically offer a Pencil tool, a Line
tool, a Pen tool, and different Shape tools, as shown in Figure 3-10.
The Pencil tool lets you draw a line by dragging the mouse. This lets you
create lines of any shape created by the path along which you move the
mouse.

608
The Line tool lets you draw straight lines by dragging the mouse. After you
draw a straight line, you can always reshape it later, but if you need a per-
fectly straight line, the Line tool will meet your needs. 
The Shape tools (Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Polygon, and Oval) let you
draw specific shapes, which you can always reshape later. 
The Pen tool lets you draw a line by clicking define points. Each time you
click another point, the drawing program automatically draws a connecting
straight line. To curve a line, you can drag direction points that appear. Some
drawing programs may also let you drag the Pen tool to create curved lines.
Choosing a Painting and Drawing Program
If you’re a professional or aspiring graphics designer, your only real choices
are Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Flash (www.adobe.com).
All three programs are heavily used in the graphics design industry.
Although these programs are mandatory for graphics design professionals,
most other people will likely find Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash too
expensive and complicated to use. As an alternative to these three profes-
sional-quality programs, you can find plenty of low-cost (or even free) pro-
grams that offer most of the features of these programs.
Photoshop alternatives
Perhaps the best alternative to Photoshop is a similar, less expensive pro-
gram dubbed Photoshop Elements, which is also sold by Adobe. Adobe 
markets Photoshop to professionals and Photoshop Elements to digital pho-
tography hobbyists who want to touch up their digital photographs quickly
and easily.
If you like the idea of an easy-to-use digital photography editor, consider
these other programs that are also geared for beginners: PhotoStudio (www.
arcsoft.com), Color It! (www.microfrontier.com), GraphicsConverter
(www.lemkesoft.com), and PhotoLine 32 (www.pl32.com). 
Although it’s not much cheaper or easier to use than Photoshop, another
alternative raster editor is Corel Painter X (www.corel.com). Whereas
Photoshop specializes in editing digital photographs, Corel Painter special-
izes in mimicking the use of ordinary artist tools, such as drawing with char-
coal or creating oil paintings on different types of paper and canvases where
your ink or oil paints can drip and soak into the surface just like the real
thing. If you’re an aspiring artist and want a program specifically designed to
mimic the handheld tools you’re already familiar with, Corel Painter might
actually be a better choice than Photoshop.

Before you buy any raster editor, grab a free copy of Paintbrush (http://
paintbrush.sourceforge.net). If you have children, grab a free copy of
TuxPaint (www.tuxpaint.org), a simple painting program designed to help
kids learn the basics of painting with a computer.
Illustrator alternatives
Although designed mostly for editing raster images, Adobe Photoshop also
includes some vector drawing capabilities. If you need to create vector draw-
ings every now and then, you can use Photoshop and never bother with a
separate vector graphics program at all. However, you may prefer using a
simpler vector drawing program instead.
For a free vector graphics program, just use the Draw program included in both
OpenOffice (www.openoffice.org) and NeoOffice (www.neooffice.org),
which are office suites described in Chapter 2 of this minibook. If you need
to draw diagrams, organizational charts, or flow charts, consider OmniGraffle
(www.omnigroup.com).
In case you need a drawing program for creating technical illustrations, you
could use any drawing program, but you might be better off using Canvas X
(www.deneba.com). Besides letting you create technical drawings, Canvas X
Specialized digital photography 
editors and organizers
Programs such as Photoshop can help you 
edit and modify digital photographs, but they 
do nothing to help you organize your digital
photographs. If you work exclusively with 
digital photographs, you might want to skip
Photoshop and consider two different pro-
grams, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (www.
adobe.com) and Apple Aperture (www.
apple.com), which are especially designed
for professional photographers. 
Both Lightroom and Aperture are designed 
to organize, sort, edit, and store your digital
photographs. Both programs also offer nonde-
structive editing, which means your original
digital image is never changed. This means that
you can always return to your original image
without having to make a separate copy of that
image.
After you’ve made any changes to a digital pho-
tograph, you can organize and sort it in a library
so that you can find it again. You can also
create a slideshow of your favorite images or
print your pictures in different ways (such as
one big picture on a page or several smaller
pictures on a page). 
Think of Lightroom and Aperture as advanced
versions of the iPhoto program. If you need only
to organize your digital images occasionally,
iPhoto should be sufficient. But if you’re con-
stantly storing, editing, and organizing digital
images, consider Lightroom or Aperture.

Choosing a Painting and Drawing Program
610
also offers options for scientific imaging and geographical information sys-
tems (GIS), which can be handy if you need to draw molecular structures or
create maps.
If you just want a simpler, less expensive version of Illustrator, consider
Intaglio (www.purgatorydesign.com). Instead of attempting to offer as
many features as possible, as Illustrator does, Intaglio offers the basic fea-
tures that most people need 90 percent of the time. As a result, Intaglio 
lets you focus more on your work and less on trying to find the features 
you need. 
Another low-cost drawing program for novices is Lineform (www.freeverse.
com). One unique feature of Lineform is that of artistic strokes, which com-
bines the visual appearance of brush strokes found in painting programs
with the ability to edit and manipulate them as separate objects, as in a
drawing program.
A third low-cost drawing program is EazyDraw (www.eazydraw.com).
Although geared for beginners, EazyDraw actually offers some advanced fea-
tures for mechanical drawings, printed circuit layouts, and electronic
schematics. 
If you want to create simple animated drawings, get iDraw (www.mac
poweruser.com), which can save your drawings as animated GIF, Flash, or
QuickTime movies. Despite its animation capabilities, iDraw offers a simpli-
fied user interface that won’t overwhelm you with options. 
Flash alternatives
Flash actually consists of two separate programs. First, there’s the Flash
development program, which lets you design and create Flash animation.
Second, there’s the free Flash player, which lets your browser display Flash
movies and animation. If you need to create Flash animation for different
purposes, you can buy the Flash development program (www.adobe.com).
If you want to create cartoons in Flash but don’t want to buy the Flash devel-
opment program, you can pick two alternatives called Toon Boom Studio
(www.toonboom.com) and Anime Studio (www.e-frontier.com). Although
both programs use the Flash file format, they provide tools to help you create
and animate cartoons much faster than the Flash development program.
Both programs specialize in helping you draw characters, animate them, 
and even synchronize audio with the movements of their mouths so that the
characters appear to be speaking correctly. If you’re just getting started with

611
Flash animation, you can buy an entry-level version of either program. When
you get familiar with creating Flash animation, move up to the professional
versions of these programs.
Graphic File Formats
Because Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash lead the market in raster
editing, vector graphics, and vector graphics animation, the three most
important file formats are Photoshop’s PSD format, Illustrator’s AI format,
and Flash’s SWF format. Although these file formats are the most popular,
most painting and drawing programs can use other file formats as well.
You can easily save a vector graphics file as a raster file, but then you lose
the ability to manipulate the objects of that picture. If you save a raster pic-
ture as a vector graphics picture, you won’t be able to modify its parts as
though it were a true vector graphics picture. (Adobe Illustrator offers a
raster-to-vector graphics conversion feature, but most drawing programs
don’t.) If you need to manipulate individual parts of a picture, create and
save your picture as a vector graphics file. If you need to manipulate individ-
ual pixels, create and save your picture as a raster file.
Raster (painting) formats
Besides Photoshop PSD files, another popular raster file format is known as
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format). TIFF was designed as a universal graphics
file format, so most graphics programs can save and open TIFF files.
TIFF files are, like Photoshop PSD files, often large, which makes them
impractical for use on Web pages. To display graphics on a Web page, Web
designers use three different file formats that compress images while retain-
ing much of the visual quality. The most popular of these raster compressed
file formats is JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), which is also used
by many digital cameras. 
JPEG files are great for storing photographic quality images, but if you just
need simple graphics, such as company logos or cartoons, then you’ll find
that the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file format is more popular.
Because the GIF format was once patented, a free alternative soon appeared
known as PNG (Portable Network Graphics). 
PNG files offer better compression than GIF files and unlike JEPG files, PNG
files can shrink files down in size without tossing out data, thus preserving
image quality. 

Graphic File Formats
612
One file format used exclusively with digital cameras is RAW, which stores
images in a format that must be converted before you can edit or print it.
The advantage of the RAW format is its ability to store more data about an
image, which can give you higher-quality digital photographs. Two big draw-
backs with the RAW format is that these files tend to be much larger than
equivalent JPEG files, and every digital camera manufacturer creates its 
own RAW format that are incompatible with RAW formats created by other
digital cameras. If you can’t convert your RAW formats into a universal file
format such as JPEG, your images could get trapped in a particular RAW
format forever. 
Vector graphics (drawing) formats
Adobe Illustrator AI files are the most popular vector graphics formats, so
many drawing programs can open and save AI files and save files in an open
standard called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). 
Another popular open standard format for vector graphics is EPS (Encapsu-
lated PostScript). Much like SVG files, EPS files are often used as an interme-
diary file format to transfer files from one drawing program to another. 
Although not an open standard, many vector graphics programs can also
store pictures as PDF (Portable Document Format) files. PDF files are used to
display the exact formatting and appearance of a picture so that others can
view and print it on their own computers. To read PDF files, you can use the
Preview program that comes with every Mac, or you can download a free
copy of the Adobe Acrobat Reader.
If you run across a graphics file format that you can’t open, try to convert 
it using GraphicConverter (www.lemkesoft.com) or DeBabelizer (www.
equilibrium.com).

hether you like it or not (probably not), Microsoft Windows is the
most used operating system in the world. (Note that “most used”
doesn’t necessarily mean “most popular” or “most respected.”) If you’re
using a Mac, chances are good you don’t want to use a Windows PC. 
As much as you might enjoy using your Mac, sometimes you might need to
run Windows because you need to use a program that can run only on
Windows. When faced with this dilemma, you have a choice:
✦You can buy a Windows PC and use that computer just to run the
Windows program you need. However, this is not only inconvenient but
also expensive. 
✦As a more practical alternative, you can run Windows on your Mac. Ever
since Apple started using the same parts as ordinary Windows PCs
(that is, Intel processors), you’ve been able to actually turn your Mac
into a Windows PC. 
Of course, turning your Mac into an ordinary Windows PC is a lot like buying
a Ferrari and turning it into a garbage truck. You can do it, but why would
you want to?
Instead of wiping out your hard drive and running Windows on it, you have
other ways to run Windows on your Mac that still let you use all the features
that made you want to use a Mac in the first place. 
Purist Mac enthusiasts might shudder at the thought of Windows tainting
their hard drive, but many programs run only on Windows, such as astrol-
ogy or stock picking programs, and custom applications developed by a
company for in-house use. 

Giving Your Mac a Dual Personality with Boot Camp
614
Giving Your Mac a Dual Personality with Boot Camp
To install Windows on a Mac, you can split your hard drive in half (the split
portions are called partitions) and use one partition to store Windows and a
second to store Mac OS X. By storing two different operating systems on
your hard drive, you can choose which operating system to use every time
you turn on your computer. To divide your hard drive into partitions and
install Windows, Apple provides a program called Boot Camp. 
To use Boot Camp, you need the following:
✦A Mac that uses an Intel processor
✦Version 10.5 or higher of the Mac OS X operating system
✦A printer for printing out instructions for installing Boot Camp
✦At least 10GB free on your hard drive
✦The latest firmware updates
Firmware is software stored on your Mac’s circuit board. Firmware basi-
cally tells your Mac how to turn itself on and work with all of its hard-
ware components. If Apple has released new firmware for your Mac, you
can find and retrieve it by clicking on the Apple menu and choosing
Software Update.
✦A legitimate copy of Windows XP SP2 or any version of Vista (Basic,
Home, Business, or Ultimate editions)
You must use a full, 32-bit version of Windows XP or Vista that comes on
a single CD or DVD. If you use an upgrade version, a 64-bit version, or a
version that comes on multiple discs (CDs), you cannot install Windows
using Boot Camp. 
Follow these basic steps to use Boot Camp:
1. Make sure your Mac can run Boot Camp.
2. Create a partition on your hard drive and install Windows.
The following sections give the details you need to complete these steps.
Making sure you can run Boot Camp
If you have a new Mac, chances are very good that you’ll be able to run Boot
Camp. However, the older your Mac is, the lower your chances are of being
able to use this program.

An About This Mac window, shown in Figure 4-1, appears.
2. Make sure the processor type contains the word Intel, such as Intel

If the processor type contains the term PowerPC, you can’t use 
Boot Camp.
3. Make sure the version number is 10.5 or higher.
If the version number is lower, such as 10.3, you can’t use Boot Camp
until you get a newer version of Mac OS X.
4. Click the Close button of the About This Mac window.
Identifying the amount of free space on your hard drive
You need at least 10GB of free space on your hard drive to install both Boot
Camp and Windows. To find out how much free space you have left on your
hard drive, click the Finder icon in the Dock and, in the Finder window that
opens, click the Macintosh HD icon in the left pane. If you look at the status
bar at the bottom of the Finder window, you can see how much space is
available on your hard drive.

Installing Windows
When you’re certain your Mac can run Boot Camp, you need to go through
two more steps before you can install Windows. First, you need to partition
your hard drive. This reserves a chunk of your hard drive for Windows.
Some good news here: Creating a partition and installing Windows on your
computer are tasks you have to do only once (unless your hard drive
crashes and you have to reinstall everything all over again).
Second, you need to install Windows on your newly created hard drive parti-
tion. Installing Windows can be time-consuming but isn’t necessarily difficult.
The two most technical parts of installing Windows on a Mac involves parti-
tioning your hard drive and choosing that partition to install Windows on.
Partitioning divides your hard drive in two parts: one part for Mac OS X and
the second part for Windows. After you partition your hard drive, you must
tell Windows which partition to install on, and you must specify the partition
designated for Windows. 
If you install Windows on the wrong partition, you’ll wipe out everything on
your Mac. If you don’t feel comfortable partitioning a hard drive and choos-
ing the right partition to install Windows on, get a more knowledgeable
friend to help you.
To install Windows, follow these steps:
1. Open the Finder window by clicking the Finder icon on the Dock. 
2. Choose Go➪Utilities. 
The contents of the Utilities folder appear in the right pane.
3. Double-click the Boot Camp Assistant icon.
A Boot Camp Assistant window appears, informing you of the process of
using Boot Camp, as shown in Figure 4-2.
4. (Optional) Click the Print Installation & Setup Guide button.
A Print dialog appears.
5. Change the default settings, such as changing the paper size, and 
click OK.
A second Print dialog appears, letting you choose a specific printer and
number of copies to print.
6. Choose a printer and click the Print button.
The Installation & Setup Guide prints out, and the Boot Camp Assistant
window appears again (refer to Figure 4-2).

for installing Boot Camp and then click the Continue button.
The Boot Camp Assistant window displays a Create a Partition for

9. Move the pointer over the divider between the Macintosh partition
and the Windows partition, hold down the mouse button, and drag
the mouse left or right to choose a partition size. 
If you’re installing Windows XP, the minimum partition size should be
5GB. If you’re installing Vista, the minimum partition size should be 8GB.
You might want to choose an even larger partition size if you plan to
install many Windows programs.
10. Click the Partition button.
Boot Camp partitions your hard drive. (This process might take a little
while.) When partitioning is completed, another Boot Camp Assistant
window appears, asking you to insert your valid Windows installation
disc in your Mac, as shown in Figure 4-4.
11. Insert your Windows installation disc in your Macintosh and then
click Start Installation button.
When the Windows installation program asks you which partition to
install on, look for the partition that’s the same size you specified in 
Step 8 and has the words BOOT CAMP displayed. If you choose the wrong
partition, Windows might install on the partition used by your Mac, which
could wreck your files and bring your entire Mac crashing to its knees. 
12. Follow the Windows installation instructions on the screen, and when
the installation is finished, eject the disc.
Be patient. Installing Windows can take time and Windows will reboot
several times during installation, so don’t panic if the screen suddenly
goes blank.

Choosing an operating system with Boot Camp
After you’ve used Boot Camp to install Windows on your Mac, you can use
Boot Camp to choose which operating system to run by following these
steps:
1. Restart your computer and hold down the Option key until two disk
icons appear.
The two disk icons are labeled Windows and the second labeled
Macintosh HD. (If you changed the name of your Mac’s hard disk, you’ll
see this name displayed instead.)
2. Double-click the Windows or Macintosh Startup Disk icon.
Your chosen operating system starts up.
To switch to a different operating system, you have to shut down the current
operating system and repeat the preceding steps to choose the other operat-
ing system.
If you start up your Mac without holding down the Option key, your Mac
starts up the default operating system. You can define the default operating
system in Mac OS X by following these steps: 
1. Within Mac OS X, click the Apple menu and choose System Prefer-
ences to make the System Preferences window appear.
2. In the System Preferences window, click the Startup Disk icon under
the System category.
Windows shows you the Startup Disk window (see Figure 4-5), which
asks for the CD or DVD driver disc you burned earlier.
Figure 4-5:

3. Click the Mac OS X or Windows icon and click the Restart button.
If you click the Target Disk Mode button, you can make your Mac appear like
an external hard drive when connected to another computer through a
FireWire cable.
If you want to wipe out the partition on your hard drive that contains
Windows, you can do so by following these steps:
1. Double-click the Boot Camp Assistant icon in the Utilities folder.
An Introduction dialog appears. 
2. Click the Continue button.
A Select Task dialog appears. 
3. Click the Create or remove a Windows partition button and click the
Continue button.
A Restore Disk to a Single Volume dialog appears. 
Wiping out your Windows partition deletes all data stored on that parti-
tion that you created using Windows.
4. Click the Restore button.
Using Virtual Machines
One problem with Boot Camp is that it forces you to run either Windows or
Mac OS X. If you want to run Windows and Mac OS X at the same time and
switch between one or the other, you need to use a virtualization program
such as Parallels (www.parallels.com) or Fusion (www.vmware.com). 
Virtualization is a technology that lets you run multiple operating systems 
at the same time where each operating system time-shares the computer’s
hardware. Because the operating system isn’t really controlling the com-
puter’s hardware completely, the operating system is called a virtual
machine (as opposed to a real machine). 
Parallels and Fusion work in similar ways by creating a single file on your
Mac hard drive that represents a virtual PC hard drive that contains the
actual Windows operating system plus any additional Windows programs
you might install, such as Microsoft Office. 
When you run Parallels or Fusion, the program boots up from this virtual
hard drive while your original Mac OS X operating system continues to run.
This lets you run another operating system, such as Windows, inside a sepa-
rate Mac OS X window, as shown in Figure 4-6. 

Book V
Chapter 4
Running Windows
on a Mac
Using Virtual Machines
621
Because the operating system stored on the virtual hard drive has to share
the computer’s processor and memory with Mac OS X, operating systems
running on virtual machines tend to run slightly slower than the same oper-
ating system running on a computer all by itself. 
Besides letting you run multiple operating systems simultaneously, virtual-
ization programs also let you run different types of operating systems. As
mentioned previously, Boot Camp works only with Windows XP SP2 or Vista,
but virtualization programs let you run any operating system that can run on
Intel processors, including older versions of Windows (such as Windows 98
or Windows 2000), Linux (such as Ubuntu or Red Hat), obscure operating
systems (such as Solaris or OpenBSD), or long-abandoned operating sys-
tems (such as MS-DOS or OS/2). 
More people are likely to run Windows than OS/2 or Solaris, so both Parallels
and Fusion offer additional features to make using Windows as seamless as
an ordinary Mac program.
Instead of forcing you to load Windows and then load a specific program
within Windows, virtualization programs let you store a Windows program
icon directly on the Desktop or on the Dock so that it behaves exactly like a
Mac program icon.
Clicking a Windows program icon loads Windows and the Windows program
at the same time without showing the Windows desktop or the Windows
Start menu. By integrating Windows programs as if they were Mac programs,
virtualization programs shield you from the clunky Windows interface.
Figure 4-6:
A virtualiza-
tion program
lets you run
Windows
inside a
separate
Mac
window. 

Using Virtual Machines
622
The background of Figure 4-7 shows the Mac desktop and the VMware
Fusion menu bar (VMware Fusion is the virtualization program running).
Running inside a Mac window is the Windows Internet Explorer browser.
Notice that this window displays Internet Explorer’s menus and the ugly
appearance of a Windows screen trapped inside the simple yet elegant
design of the Mac user interface.
Another feature related specifically to Windows is data sharing. If you open a
program such as WordPerfect in Windows and type some text, you can copy
that text out of Windows and paste it directly into any Mac program (and
vice versa). This further integrates Windows programs into the Mac and
gives you a chance to transfer data between Mac and Windows programs. 
Besides letting you cut, copy, and paste text and graphics between Windows
and Mac programs, virtualization programs also let you create shared fold-
ers where you can store files that you can access from either Windows or
Mac OS X. This lets you run a Windows-specific program, save the file in the
shared folder, and then retrieve the file from the Mac. 
To ease the migration from Windows to the Mac, virtualization programs can
clone your existing Windows PC and duplicate it, with all your data and pro-
grams, on to the Mac. You can essentially use your old Windows PC as a vir-
tual computer on your Mac. 
Because everyone knows that Windows isn’t the most reliable operating
system around, virtualization programs let you save snapshots of your vir-
tual machine’s current state. That way, if Windows crashes and wipes itself
out, the virtualization program can load a previously saved snapshot to
restore your virtual machine to an earlier time when it was working.
If you need to run Windows and Mac programs, virtualization programs offer
the best combination of convenience and simplicity. However, virtualization
programs have slight drawbacks that you should know about:
✦Program delay: When you run Windows and Windows programs within
Boot Camp, that program has total access to your computer’s hardware,
which means the program will run as fast as it would on a normal PC.
However, when you run Windows within a virtualization program, the
virtualization program demands attention from the Intel processor,
which means that both Windows and Mac programs can run slightly (or
dramatically) slower than normal. 
For programs like word processors or browsers, this slight delay might
not be noticeable, but for programs that demand speed, such as high-
end graphics program like Adobe Photoshop, this speed difference can
become noticeable and annoying. 

Book V
Chapter 4
Running Windows
on a Mac
Using Virtual Machines
623
✦Memory hogging: A second problem with virtualization programs is that
loading and running additional operating systems (besides Mac OS X)
gobbles up memory. If your Mac has 1GB of RAM, you’ll have the bare
minimum needed to run Windows XP on your Mac. If you want to run
Vista on your Mac, you need at least 2GB of RAM for acceptable perform-
ance. To ensure that your Mac doesn’t slow to a crawl when running
another operating system, you should have at least 2GB of RAM. 
Buying extra memory ($100), a virtualization program ($80), and a 
legitimate copy of Windows ($200–$400) drives up the cost of running
Windows on your Mac. Even worse, all this money still leaves you stuck
using an ugly Windows program.
✦Slower performance for advanced video games: Although most
Windows programs work flawlessly when run within a virtualization pro-
gram, the most notable exceptions are high-performance video games,
such as flight simulators. Such high-performance video games require a
separate graphics card with plenty of memory to create realistic visual
effects. Running such programs in a virtualization program typically
means slow, choppy performance that can be annoying at best or render
the game completely unplayable at worst.
If you’re switching from a Windows PC to a Mac, virtualization programs can
help ease your migration to the Mac. If you’re already a Mac user, virtualiza-
tion programs ensure that you’ll always be able to run both Windows and
Mac programs for maximum compatibility with everyone.

Using CrossOver Mac
624
Using CrossOver Mac
With Boot Camp, Parallels, and Fusion, you need to buy a separate copy of
Windows. If the idea of wasting your money on Windows just to run a hand-
ful of programs makes you nauseous, consider a unique program called
CrossOver Mac (www.codeweavers.com). CrossOver Mac lets you run
Windows programs without a copy of Windows. The program works by fool-
ing Windows programs into thinking they’re really running on a Windows PC.
CrossOver Mac lets you pop a Windows CD into your Mac and install the
Windows program on a simulated PC that CrossOver Mac creates automati-
cally on your Mac. After you’ve installed a Windows program, CrossOver
Mac displays the normal Windows icons inside a Finder window. Double-
clicking the Windows program icon runs that Windows program on your
Mac, as shown in Figure 4-8.
Unfortunately, CrossOver Mac isn’t perfect. Like Parallels and Fusion,
CrossOver Mac runs only on Intel Macintosh computers. A more crucial limi-
tation is that CrossOver Mac works with only a handful of Windows pro-
grams, so you can’t run any Windows program on a Mac with CrossOver Mac
and expect it to run flawlessly.
To help you determine whether your favorite Windows program will work
with CrossOver Mac, the product’s Web site (www.codeweavers.com/
compatibility/browse/name) lists all known programs that have been
tested and verified to work correctly. Each program is given a ranking, 
as follows:
✦Gold: The program works flawlessly on the Mac.
✦Silver: The program works with occasional problems.
✦Bronze: The program runs, but you might run into minor problems.
✦Honorable Mention: The program has been tested to run correctly, but
it isn’t officially supported, so you might run into minor (or major)
problems.
✦Untested: Nobody has tried the program yet, so you might be the first.
✦Known not to work: The program won’t work no matter how hard you
cry, beg, or pray.
Because testing each program for compatibility with CrossOver Mac can
take time, most Gold-ranked programs are older versions of popular
Windows programs, such as Microsoft Office 2000.

If you need to run the latest Windows programs, a little-known Windows pro-
gram, or a custom Windows program, CrossOver Mac probably won’t let you
run it. However, if you need to run only a handful of older, popular programs,
CrossOver Mac might be the ideal solution. Just try the trial version with
your favorite Windows program, and if it works, buy the commercial version
of CrossOver Mac. Then you can happily use your favorite Windows pro-
gram while secretly pretending you’re really being productive with a Mac.

W
ork, work, work. We all work too much, so kick back, fire up your
Mac, and blow off steam with your favorite video game. Your Mac is
be great for helping you get stuff done, but your Mac is even better for help-
ing you have some fun without breaking any laws to do it. There are loads of
ways you can have fun with your Mac. You can start with several free games
that can turn your computer into a chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe opponent.
If you get tired of these games, you can always buy more, and you have a
vast array of video games to choose from. 
Games can double as effective learning tools, too. With the right programs,
you can turn your Mac into an inspiring math, grammar, or science tutor for
children, or a motivating foreign language or music teacher for yourself. Or,
rather than pick up a new skill, you can use your Mac to help with your cur-
rent hobbies. Although Macs might not help you hang-glide or belly dance,
your Mac can run unique programs covering everything from needlepoint to
gardening to collecting and trading baseball cards. Read on to explore some
ideas for enjoying your free time (or ways to goof off during your so-called
work time).
¿No Hablas Español? Then Get Crackin’!
Perhaps you’ve always wanted to learn another language but never found
the time to go to a class. Well, these days, you can learn almost anything —
on your own schedule, and without having to step foot outside your own
front door. So, what are you waiting for?

¿No Hablas Español? Then Get Crackin’!
628
The best way to learn any foreign language is to immerse yourself in it
through listening, speaking, and reading it. Your Mac can’t literally put you
on the streets of, say, Barcelona, but it can act as a friendly guide and tutor
while exposing you to the voices of native speakers. You can even speak into
a microphone and have your pronunciation analyzed (a great way to hone
your accent before anyone hears you and questions which language you’re
trying to speak). Whether you’re learning a foreign language in school, for
fun, or for business, you can use programs on your Mac to practice speak-
ing, reading, and even writing a foreign language.
For free language lessons, visit the BBC site at www.bbc.co.uk/languages,
where you can find introductory vocabulary lessons, pronunciation audio
files, and videos in a variety of languages. (See Figure 5-1.) These introduc-
tory lessons won’t make you fluent in a new language, but they can teach
you the basics.
Another useful (and free) language Web site is UniLang (http://home.
unilang.org), which is a community-run site that provides free resources
to anyone interested in learning practically any language, including Lithuanian,
Afrikaans, and Gaelic. Some of its many language resources include chil-
dren’s stories, phrasebooks, and vocabulary lists so that you can make your
own flash cards.

Free language lessons can get you started, but for more advanced language
lessons, you’ll probably have to buy a language course. Here are some good
ones to consider:
✦Berlitz (www.berlitzbooks.com): Provides audio courses that focus
on helping travelers master useful phrases that they’ll likely need when
they travel overseas, such as “I have gotten sick five times since drink-
ing the local water” or “What do you mean I have to pay for toilet paper
in a public restroom?” 
✦Pimsleur (www.pimsleurapproach.com): Named after its creator, 
Dr. Paul Pimsleur, the Pimsleur method focuses on teaching foreign lan-
guages primarily by listening to the most commonly used words in 
each language. Besides emphasizing listening, the Pimsleur method also
encourages responding by gradually piecing together the grammar of 
a language through constant repetition and practice. Pimsleur’s princi-
ple is that anyone can learn a new language in the same way that babies
learn to speak, which is by listening and then attempting to speak back
to their parents (until they’re old enough to start arguing with their 
parents). 
✦Transparent Language (www.transparent.com): Offers free language
articles (so that you can practice reading), free language games, and free
introductory language lessons to teach you how to recognize and speak
basic vocabulary so you can communicate with people in other coun-
tries without resorting to hand signals.
✦Rosetta Stone (www.rosettastone.com): One of the most acclaimed
language courses, Rosetta Stone emphasizes listening, reading, writing,
and speaking another language. By focusing on four different elements of
learning any language, Rosetta Stone is the closest you can get to immers-
ing yourself in another country. Figure 5-2 shows different phrases on
the screen that you can choose in response to hearing a question in a
foreign language. By turning learning into a game, you can pick up a new
language while having fun in the process.
✦Unforgettable Languages (www.unforgettablelanguages.com):
If you have trouble remembering foreign words, you might try this
course, which teaches foreign words by relating them to another word.
For example, to help you remember that the Mandarin word for tree
(shu, pronounced like “shoe”), you’re told to think of a shoe in a tree. By
using such vivid word associations, this course can make memorizing
vocabulary words fun (especially if you can find naughty words that
sound similar to foreign language phrases).
✦Power-Glide (www.power-glide.com): These courses make learning a
new language interactive through videos, stories, and games. By rein-
forcing language concepts in multiple ways, Power-Glide helps make
learning and remembering a foreign language as effortless as possible.

Tooting Your Own Horn
630
Tooting Your Own Horn
Learning to play an instrument is much like learning a foreign language. You
can’t just read about it; you have to hear and try it yourself, listening and
correcting as you go along. Well, I have good news: You can turn your Mac
into an interactive music teacher with the right software.
Learning to play music is more than just banging away on drums or a key-
board. To understand the science behind music, buy a program called Math
& Music (www.wildridge.com), shown in Figure 5-3. This unique course
explains the physics behind sound — how vibrating strings relate to har-
mony and how ratios define the musical scale.
To learn how to read music and chords, buy Practica Musica (www.
ars-nova.com), which can help train your ear to recognizing different
notes while practicing writing your own music at the same time. 
After you understand how music works and how to read it, you might be
anxious to start making music of your own. If you want to learn to play the
guitar, buy GuitarVision (www2.guitarvision.com), which works with
iTunes to help you learn the exact chords, notes, and finger positioning to
play many of your favorite songs stored in iTunes.
Or you might try learning to tickle the ivories with PianoWizard (www.piano
wizard.com), which uses video games to help you play your favorite songs,
in genres from classical to pop. If you’re a teenager, you can play and hear
your favorite music while annoying your parents at the same time.

free copy of GarageBand that comes with every Mac.
With GarageBand, you can learn music, play an instrument, record your
tunes, and mix them to produce the perfect song. Think of your Mac as a
production studio, music teacher, and recording engineer that can help you
write and record your own unique song.
Getting Touchy-Feely with Your Keyboard
No more poking along on the computer keyboard with your index fingers.
You know people are looking at you funny. Even your six-year-old types
better than you do. To finally start getting the hang of your keyboard, check
out one of the most popular typing tutorials, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing
(available from www.broderbund.com), which has been used in schools
and employment agencies for years. This program combines typing lessons
with arcade games to make learning fun. (Now if bosses would only use
arcade games to make working in an office fun, we’d be all set.)
Another popular typing program is Ten Thumbs Typing Tutorial (www.
tenthumbstypingtutor.com), shown in Figure 5-4. In addition to provid-
ing the usual drills and games to teach typing, the program also works with
iTunes by letting you type lyrics from your favorite songs. For greater flexi-
bility, practice typing lyrics from different types of songs, or else if you only
type lyrics from rap music, you might get really good at typing four-letter
words and nothing else.

Playing Hooky with Your Hobby
Almost everyone has a hobby that they’d rather be doing instead of work.
Although hobbies can be fun, they often have tedious or repetitive actions
that can suck up your time and make you feel like you’re at a job. To keep
such necessary, tedious actions from stopping you from fully enjoying your
hobby, load the right program and make your Mac help you speed up and
simplify your hobby more than ever.
If you enjoy scrapbooking, combining photographs, memorabilia, and jour-
naling into a book to keep track of your memories, you might want to digitize
the whole process. Grab your favorite digital photographs and place them in
a digital scrapbook using iScrapbook (available at www.chronosnet.com)
or iRemember (www.macscrapbook.com). Best of all, both programs can
yank pictures out of iPhoto so you can take advantage of all the hard work
you spent organizing pictures in iPhoto. 
Not only can digital scrapbooks store your memories, but they allow you to
share them with others in ways that physical scrapbooks cannot. You can
e-mail them or print them up after embellishing them with fancy borders and
graphics.
The most likely people who might want to share your memories are your 
relatives. To help you keep track of your relatives and your family tree, you
can use MacFamilyTree (available at www.onlymac.de), Family (www.
saltatory.com), or Reunion (http://leisterpro.com). By making it
easy to track family names, photographs, birthdates, and locations, you can
track your relatives wherever they go (and avoid them if necessary). 
If you enjoy working with needlepoint, you might want to create your own
designs with Stitch Painter (www.cochenille.com). Coin collectors 
might want to grab a copy of Numismatist’s Notebook (available at www.
tabberer.com/sandyknoll), and comic book collectors might want a
copy of ComicBookLover (www.bitcartel.com). If you’re the outdoor type
who enjoys planting, try using PlanGarden (www.plangarden.com) to
choose the best plants for your area.

✦Arcade games that emphasize eye-hand coordination
✦Multiplayer, online virtual worlds
Some games combine multiple elements, such as a multiplayer game that
emphasizes arcade-style play, or a multiplayer game that lets people play
bridge or poker online. 
Some video games can be educational, such as teaching you how to manage
a business, whereas other video games can be nostalgic, such as ancient
arcade video games like Pac-Man or Space Invaders. Still other video games
can provide an emotional outlet so you can blast away aliens, soldiers, and
other fictional computer-generated images and vent your frustration on an
imaginary image rather than on a living creature within your reach. If you
just want to play video games, you can turn your Mac into the ultimate
entertainment center.
Playing strategically
Strategy games are more complicated board games. Unlike arcade-style
games where reflexes determine your success, strategy games rely on plan-
ning and thinking to win. Aspyr (www.aspyr.com) provides several popular
strategy games.

Aspyr also sells Sid Meier’s Civilization game, which lets you control an
entire civilization. Using trade, politics, and outright war, you can expand
your civilization at the expense of others and try to take over the world with-
out having to get elected to political office first to do it. 
If you’ve ever dreamed about running your own TV station, play TV Station
Manager (available from Winter Wolves at www.winterwolves.com), where
you control the programming of an independent TV station and try to boost
ratings. If you think there’s too much garbage on TV these days, see whether
you can make your TV station profitable offering quality entertainment. Like
most real TV stations, you might find that trashy TV shows really are more
profitable in the long run. 
The same company, Winter Wolves, also provides Soccer Manager and
Boxing Manager. In Soccer Manager, you manage a soccer game and choose
different players to control a soccer team. In Boxing Manager, you pick a
boxer and manage him through fights. Manage your boxer correctly, and he
can work his way up to the championship. Manage him poorly, and he’ll
wind up flat on his back on the canvas.
Sports Interactive Games (www.sigames.com) offers Out of the Park
Baseball and NHL Eastside Hockey manager, where you can pretend to
manage a professional sports team and guide them to victory. See if you can
win a baseball championship without any of your players relying on banned
performance-enhancing drugs. Take your hockey team to the top while
trying to keep the front teeth of all your players intact. The challenges can
be endless.
One popular series of strategy games is the Tycoon series, such as Roller
Coaster Tycoon (where you design and manage an amusement park) and
Zoo Tycoon (where you design and manage a zoo). These Tycoon games let
you fantasize about how you could make your local zoo or amusement park
more exciting and profitable if only given the chance. Add a death-defying
roller coaster to your amusement park and see how sales of milk shakes
from a nearby concession stand might go down. Add an exotic animal to
your zoo and see how much additional revenue you can generate without
exploiting the animal in the process.
If the idea of being a manager sounds too tame for you, consider destroying
entire civilizations at the touch of a button with DefCon (www.ambrosia
sw.com), a game in which you play the role of a general in control of a
nuclear arsenal. (See Figure 5-5.) Launch nuclear missiles at your enemies
and see how much faster you can destroy the planet by using atomic
weapons rather than diplomacy.

In case you’d rather save the planet than destroy it (which pretty much 
rules out any chance you might have for becoming a dictator), play Global
Warming (available at www.midoritech.com). By playing the game, you
can see how your actions can help save the planet both in the make-believe
world of your Mac and in the real world around you. 
Rather than play a strategy game that you’ve never heard of, you might
prefer playing a game that you already know how to play. If you like Stratego,
buy WebStratego (www.metaforge.net), which lets you play against
people from all over the world through the Internet. If you like playing Risk,
try taking over the world with a computer version called Lux Delux
(http://sillysoft.net). 
One of the more unique strategy games is called Bridge Construction Set
(www.garagegames.com), where you try to design a bridge that can hold
up a train. Design the bridge correctly, and the train crosses safely. Design
the bridge poorly, and the train crashes into the river below. By teaching you
how to build a bridge, this game indirectly teaches physics at the same time.
Head on down to the arcade 
Long before video games appeared in coin-operated arcades, people used to
play pinball. Although pinball machines have faded into obscurity, that doesn’t
mean you can’t still play them on your Mac. (It’s just that tilting your Mac
won’t help boost your score any.)

For an electronic version of a pinball game, visit LittleWing Pinball
(www.littlewingpinball.com). These pinball games let you tilt, bump,
rattle, and shake a virtual pinball machine to achieve the best score.
Pinball machines may be ancient history for today’s generation of kids.
Instead, they might prefer arcade games that originated with Pong, Space
Invaders, Asteroids, and Pac-Man. The goal of these games was simple: Use
your reflexes to stay alive as long as possible. 
For a free Pac-Man clone, download a copy of Pac the Man X (www.mcsebi.
com). If you remember playing Frogger, trying to navigate a frog across a
busy highway without getting squished, you can relive your childhood by
playing the Christmas Super Frog (www.koingosw.com), which is like
Frogger but with a Christmas theme. If you remember trying to save cities
from nuclear missiles with Missile Command, you can download a free
Missile Command clone (http://iskub.sippan.se/missile) and see
whether you still have what it takes to protect the world from a nuclear 
holocaust.
Growing beyond the primitive two-dimensional graphics of the early arcade
games, the latest computer arcade games now embrace three-dimensional
graphics for use in first-person shooter games and sports simulations.
Video game accessories
You can play most games by using the keyboard
and the mouse. However, arcade-style video
games can be much clumsier to play. Trying to
fly an F-16 jet fighter simulator using the key-
board can seem unnatural and confusing, so
that’s why many companies sell special game-
playing accessories such as joysticks, steering
wheels, and even special mice designed to put
more controls at your fingertips than a tradi-
tional mouse.
If you want to play a flight simulator or a first-
person shooter game, you’ll probably want a
joystick. If you want to play a racing simulator,
you’ll probably want a steering wheel and
pedals. For optimum graphics, you should get a
Mac with a separate graphics card inside,
included in most iMacs, MacBook Pros, and
Mac Pros. (The Mac Mini, MacBook, and 
some iMacs don’t use a separate graphics
card, which means games can run slower or
choppier.)
Some popular companies that make game-
playing accessories include TrustMaster
(www.thrustmaster.com), CH Products
(www.chproducts.com), and Logitech
(www.logitech.com). With the right joy-
stick or steering wheel, you can immerse your-
self in your favorite video game and leave the
real world behind (until, of course, someone
from the real world reminds you to pay your
electricity bill).

First-person shooter games typically give you the view of a soldier running
through a maze or rough terrain, blasting away targets and trying to avoid
getting shot at in return. For a free first-person shooter game, grab a copy of
AssaultCube (http://assault.cubers.net), which lets you play with
others to roam around buildings and gun each other down. 
For a historical first-person shooter game, play Call of Duty (www.aspyr.
com), which puts you in the middle of various World War Two battles to see
whether you can survive. If you’d rather play a flight simulator and dogfight
other planes, buy a copy of OSX Skyfighters 1945 (www.donsgames.com)
and strap yourself into the virtual cockpit of a P-51, Fw-190, Hellcat, or
Japanese Zero and see if you can become an ace. 
If the idea of killing even virtual enemies makes you squeamish, try to win 
a battle of wits and skill by playing a sports simulation game instead. Play 
GL Golf (http://nuclearnova.com) and practice your putting and golf
strokes without having to get any fresh air outside to do it. If playing 18
holes sounds too exhausting, conquer a miniature golf course by playing
Wacky Mini Golf (www.danlabgames.com) and try conquering those pesky
windmills blocking the putting green instead. If you’re ready, take on Tiger
Woods in Tiger Woods PGA Tour (www.aspyr.com) and see whether your
golf skills can match up with the masters.
In case golf doesn’t get your adrenaline pumping, jump into a race car and
run your opponents off the track in Jammin’ Racer (www.danlabgames.com).
For a more realistic racing simulation, grab a free copy of VDrift (http://
vdrift.net), which lets you simulate racing on tracks in Detroit, Le Mans,
Monaco, and Barcelona, as shown in Figure 5-6. For a motocross simulation,
download a free copy of X-Moto (http://xmoto.sourceforge.net) and
take out your road rage on animated opponents. 
To play football without getting beat up on the playing field, try PlayMaker
Football (http://playmaker.com). To play table tennis and test your mean
serve on virtual opponents, try Table Tennis Pro (www.grassgames.com).
For a snowboarding simulation, buy Slope Rider (www.monteboyd.com). If
you’d rather control a penguin sliding down a snow-covered slope, try the
free Tux Racer (http://tuxracer.sourceforge.net) game instead.
No matter what type of game you want, you can find one that runs on your
Mac. If you want to play a game that runs only on Windows, install a copy of
Windows on your Mac by using Boot Camp (see Book V, Chapter 4) and turn
your Mac into a game-playing PC. With the ability to play games designed 
for both Windows and the Mac, you actually have a greater variety of games
to play than anyone running a Windows computer. With the libraries of
Windows and Mac games to choose from, your only limitation is finding the
time to play all the games you want.

Playing multiplayer, online role-playing games
After a while, playing even the most exciting game by yourself can get
boring, which is why many people prefer playing games online to compete
against others. Such an online experience can give people a sense of commu-
nity, even if they never meet. One of the most popular of these online role-
playing games is the World of Warcraft (www.worldofwarcraft.com), a
fantasy virtual world that lets you create a cartoon character called an
avatar and roam around bartering, negotiating, and attacking people or
mythical creatures with a sword or a magic spell. With over eight million
players, no session of World of Warcraft will ever be the same. 
Although some people prefer fantasy, others prefer science fiction. If you’d
rather use lasers rather than sword and conquer universes rather than cas-
tles, join EVE Online (www.eve-online.com) and roam through outer
space, shooting at spaceships, trading with other planets, and negotiating
with aliens (who might not be any more bizarre than the people you nor-
mally associate with at work). By playing EVE Online, you can take over a
galaxy and let mere mortals on this planet remain ignorant of your true
accomplishments and abilities.
Writing your own games
If you enjoy playing games, you might like cre-
ating your own games even better. Although
writing your own game might seem scary, you
can get a lot of help by buying various tools to
make game creation easier. 
To create simple games, buy the Mac Game
Creator Toolkit (http://members.aol.
com/AlStaff/macgamecreator.html),
which provides several different programs for
creating old-fashion, text-based games (similar
to the old Zork style games where you type
commands to explore an area such as GO
WEST or KILL TROLL). 
You can also buy Animation Engine and
Revolution (www.runrev.com) to create
simple 2-D graphics such as card games or
board games. If you want to get a bit more
sophisticated, you’ll have to learn a program-
ming language, such as C++.
Although you can create an entire game from
scratch by using any programming language,
such as C++, even the professionals don’t do
that. To speed up game development, the pro-
fessionals use a game engine, which basically
contains commands for animating objects on
the screen. By using a game engine, program-
mers can focus on just writing the commands
to make their game work rather than be forced
to write commands to display and manipulate
graphics on the screen as well.
Some popular game engines include the Torque
Game Engine (www.garagegames.com),
Unity Game Engine (www.unity3d.com),
and the PTK Game Engine (www.phelios.
com). By combining these game engines with
the C++ programming language, you can create
games that rival the professionals.

If living in a virtual world of fantasy and science fiction doesn’t appeal to
you, you might prefer Second Life (http://secondlife.com), which puts
you inside a virtual world similar to the real world. The only difference is
that inside this virtual world, you can experiment with different ways of
living that you might never do in real life like playing different genders or
acting aggressive (if you’re normally shy) or making yourself ugly (if you’re
normally attractive). Second Life also offers a special Teen Life area just so
teenagers can explore within a safe environment with other teenagers. (Now
you just have to worry about the danger of meeting other teenagers.) In both
Second Life and Teen Life, you create a character (an avatar) and roam
around interacting with others. You can buy virtual land, run a business, or
just meet new people without the fear of real-life rejection.

With the right game running on your Mac, you need never be bored again.

B
acking up data is something that most people routinely ignore, like
changing the oil in their car on a regular basis. The only time most
people think about backing up their data is after they’ve already lost some-
thing important, such as a business presentation. Of course, by that time,
it’s already too late.
Backing up your data might not sound as exciting as playing video games or
browsing the Internet, but it should be a part of your routine every day. If
you can’t risk losing your data, you can’t risk not taking the time to back it up.
Understanding Different Backup Options
The simplest and most practical solution for backing up your data is to
make duplicate copies of every important file. Although this seems simple in
theory, you must make sure to copy your files periodically, such as at the
end of every day. If you forget to copy your files, your backup copies could
become woefully outdated, which can make them nearly useless. 
Another issue with backing up data concerns storing and retrieving it. If 
you store duplicates of your important files on your hard drive, you have to
make sure you don’t accidentally use those backup files instead of the origi-
nal files (and then accidentally copy the obsolete original files over the
backup copies that are actually more current). 
To back up your files, consider using more than one method, because the
more backup copies you have of your critical files, the more likely it is that
you’ll never lose your data no matter what might happen to your Mac.
To reduce the amount of storage space needed to store copies of your files,
you can archive and compress your files into a ZIP or DMG file. (See Book I,
Chapter 6 for more information about creating ZIP and DMG files.) 

Understanding Different Backup Options
644
Using your hard drive
The simplest way to back up your files is to create and store duplicate
copies of your files in another part of your hard drive. This method has the
advantage of not requiring that you buy any new equipment. The huge disad-
vantage of this option is that your hard drive might fail and wipe out both
your original data and any backup files you have stored.
Another problem is that the more data you need to back up, the more space
both your original and backup files will gobble up, until eventually you might
run out of room on your hard drive. For these reasons, using your hard drive
to store backup copies of files is suitable for backing up a handful of files,
but it’s impractical for backing up large amounts of data.
Backing up to CDs/DVDs
Every Mac can write to CDs, and most Macs can also write to DVDs. As a
result, storing backups on CDs or DVDs is a popular option because CDs and
DVDs are easy to store and are pretty durable. The biggest drawback of CDs
and DVDs is their limited storage capacities. CDs can store up to 700MB of
data, and DVDs can store 4.7GB of data, with the newest DVDs capable of
storing up to 8.5GB of data. 
If you need to backup only word processor or spreadsheet files, a single CD
should be sufficient. However, music, video, and digital photographs take up
more space, which means that you might need to use several CDs to com-
pletely back up all your files of those types.
DVDs can store much more data than CDs, but even they can be limited
when you’re backing up hard drives that contain several gigabytes worth of
files. The more discs you need to back up your files, the harder it can be to
keep track of all the discs that make a complete backup of your data.
Storing data on multiple discs can be slow and tedious, which means you
might not back up your data as often as you should. Eventually, this means
your backup files are too far out of date to be useful, which defeats the pur-
pose of backing up your data in the first place.
If you can comfortably fit your most crucial files on a CD or DVD, this can be
a simple and fast backup option, but if your data exceeds the storage limits
of a single CD or DVD, using multiple discs can be too cumbersome, so you
should probably rely on another backup method.
Storing backups on USB flash drives
The low-cost and high-storage capacities of USB flash drives make them an
attractive alternative to using CDs for backing up your most crucial files. USB
flash drives offer ease of use because you can plug them into any open USB
port in a Mac and move them to another Mac. 

Book VI
Chapter 1
Protecting 
Your Data
Understanding Different Backup Options
645
The biggest drawback of USB flash drives is their limited storage capacities,
which range from 256MB to 16GB or sometimes more. As a result, USB flash
drives are most convenient for carrying your most critical files but not nec-
essarily for backing up all your important files. In contrast to the hassles of
writing (or burning) data to a CD or DVD, saving files to a USB flash drive is
as simple as saving a file in another part of your hard drive.
USB flash drives are small and easy to carry, so many people store their
most critical files on USB flash drives that they take with them. However, if
you lose your USB flash drive, anyone who finds your USB flash drive can
peek at your files. If you can’t afford to have strangers peeking at your files,
consider buying a special USB flash drive that offers encryption to protect
your files from anyone who doesn’t have your password. 
Backing up with external hard drives
To prevent the loss of all your data if your hard drive should suddenly die,
you can use external hard drives that connect to your Mac through a USB or
FireWire port. 
Both USB (Universal Serial Bus) and FireWire ports are used for connecting
peripheral to a computer. USB ports are more commonly used for connect-
ing a mouse or digital camera, whereas FireWire ports are often used for con-
necting video camcorders or other computers together. FireWire ports tend
to transfer data slightly faster than USB ports.
The main advantage of external hard drives is that copying large files is
much faster and more convenient than copying the same files to a USB flash
drive or CD/DVD. In addition, external hard drives are easy to unplug from
one Mac and plug into a second Mac. Because of their low cost, fast copying
speed, and ease of moving and plugging into any Mac, external hard drives
are the most popular choice for backing up files.
Perhaps the biggest drawback of external hard drive is that they can’t pro-
tect against a catastrophe near your computer, such as a fire burning down
your house or a flood soaking your computer desk and office. If a disaster
wipes out the entire area around your computer, your external hard drive
will likely get wiped out in the process as well.
You can treat an external hard drive as just another place to copy your files,
but for greater convenience, you should use a special backup program.
Backup programs can be set to run according to a schedule (for example, to
back up your files every night at 6:00 pm). 
If the files haven’t changed since the last time you backed them up, the
backup program saves time by skipping over those files rather than copying
the same files to the external hard drive all over again. To retrieve files, you
could just copy the files from your external hard drive back on your original

Going Back to the Past with Time Machine
646
hard drive, but watch out! If you changed a file on your original hard drive,
copying the backup copy could actually wipe out the most recent changes
and restore an old file to your hard drive, which probably isn’t what you want.
To keep you from accidentally wiping out new files with older versions of
that same file, backup programs always compare the time and date a file 
was last modified to make sure you always have copies of the latest file. To
try a free backup program for use with an external hard drive, grab a free
copy of SilverKeeper (www.lacie.com/silverkeeper), PsyncX (http://
psyncx.sourceforge.net), Carbon Copy Cloner (www.bombich.com), or
SuperDuper (www.shirt-pocket.com).
Storing backups off-site
In the old days, corporations used to back up data to tapes (which resemble
oversized audio cassette tapes) and ship them to another location. Such off-
site storage protects the data because even if a disaster wiped out both your
computer and any backup systems nearby, such as external hard drives, it’s
unlikely that it would also wipe out the off-site storage area. Off-site storage
virtually guarantees that you’ll never lose your data.
Although off-site storage can get expensive, many low-cost (and even free)
off-site storage options are available for Mac users. One simple way to create
off-site storage is to open a free e-mail account (such as with Yahoo!) and
e-mail yourself your important files. Now you can always retrieve your
important files from anywhere in the world that offers Internet access.
Many companies sell off-site storage space for a monthly fee. However, to
entice you to try their services, they often provide a limited amount of free
space that you can use for an unlimited period of time at no cost whatso-
ever. To get your free off-site storage space, sign up with one or more of the
following off-site data backup sites:
✦XDrive (www.xdrive.com): Free 5GB of storage space
✦MediaMax (www.mediamax.com): Free 25GB of storage space
✦Mozy (http://mozy.com): Free 2GB of storage space
✦ElephantDrive (www.elephantdrive.com): Free 1GB of storage space
Going Back to the Past with Time Machine
One problem with traditional backup programs is that they store only the
latest versions of your files. Normally, this is exactly what you want, but
what if you want to see an earlier version of a letter you wrote two weeks
ago? Unless you kept a copy of your backups you made two weeks ago,
trying to find files created on certain dates in the past is nearly impossible.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Protecting 
Your Data
Going Back to the Past with Time Machine
647
Fortunately, that type of problem is trivial for Apple’s new backup program,
Time Machine. Unlike traditional backup programs that copy and store the
latest versions of files, Time Machine takes snapshots of your Mac hard
drive so that you can view the exact condition of your Mac hard drive two
weeks ago, two months ago, or even two years ago. 
By seeing the exact condition of what your Mac hard drive looked like in the
past, you can see exactly what all your files looked like at that time. After
you find a specific file version from the past, you can copy and paste it into
the present. 
Setting up Time Machine
To use Time Machine, you need an external hard drive that connects to your
Mac through a USB or FireWire cable.
To set up Time Machine to work with your Mac and external hard drive,
follow these steps:
1. Connect the external hard drive to your Mac.
2. Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
A System Preferences window appears.
3. Click the Time Machine icon under the System category.
The Time Machine pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-1.
4. Click the On button.
5. Click the Choose Backup Disk button.
A dialog appears, listing all available external hard drives you can use,
as shown in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-1:

6. Click an external hard drive and click the Use for Backup button.
The Time Machine pane appears again, listing your chosen external hard
drive, as shown in Figure 1-3.
7. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Time Machine automatically backs up your hard drive every hour for the
past 24 hours, every day for the past month, and every week until you run
out of room on your external hard drive. When your external hard drive runs
out of room, Time Machine starts deleting the oldest files to make room for
the newer ones.
Defining files to skip
To save space and to avoid copying files you don’t want or care about
anyway, you can identify certain files and folders that you want Time
Machine to ignore. For example, you might not want to back up your
Applications folder if you already have all your programs stored on separate
DVDs anyway.

You can select multiple drives, files and folders by holding down the Ô
key and clicking the ones you want.
6. Click the Exclude button.
The Do Not Back Up dialog appears again (refer to Figure 1-4).
7. (Optional) Select or deselect the Warn When Old Backups Are Deleted
check box.
If this check box is selected, Time Machine won’t delete any of your old
backups without displaying a dialog requesting your approval.
8. Click Done.
The Time Machine pane appears again.
9. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Retrieving files and folders
After you’ve configured Time Machine to back up your Mac, you can use
Time Machine to view multiple windows, with each window representing a
previous condition of your Mac. So, for example, if you want to retrieve a
folder or file from three weeks ago, locate the Finder in Time Machine that
represents your Mac three weeks ago. Then you can copy the folder or file
and paste it in the Finder.
To retrieve folders or files from Time Machine, follow these steps:
1. Click the Time Machine icon in the Dock.
The Time Machine screen appears, as shown in Figure 1-6. (If the Time
Machine icon doesn’t appear in the Dock, you have to double-click the
Time Machine icon in the Applications folder.)
2. Choose one of the following ways to pick a Finder from the past:
• Click a Finder. Each time you click a window, Time Machine moves
the entire group of windows forward or backward.
• Move the pointer to the Time Machine timeline. The timeline bars
expand to display a specific date. To choose a specific date, click it. 
3. Select the file or folders you want to retrieve. 
If you select a file and press Ô+Y to choose the Quick Look command,
you can view the contents of your selected file just to make sure you
really want to retrieve it.

4. Click the Restore button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
Time Machine displays the current Finder with your selected items
retrieved.
5. Click Cancel to exit Time Machine.
Working with Data-Recovery Programs
You can lose files in a variety of ways:
✦Accidentally deleted from the hard drive: The most common way to
lose a file is by accidentally deleting it. If you try to recover your lost file
through a backup program such as Time Machine, you might be shocked
to find that your backup program can recover only your file from the
previous hour. So if you spent the last 45 minutes changing a file and
accidentally deleted it, your backup program might hold the file from
only an hour ago, but it won’t contain any of the changes you made in
the last 45 minutes.
✦Hardware failure: Another way to lose a file is through a hardware fail-
ure, such as your hard drive mangling portions of its disk surface and
wrecking any files stored there. Such a failure can go unnoticed because

backups as

windows.

Working with Data-Recovery Programs
652
the hard drive still works. As a result, your backup program will copy and
save these mangled versions of your file. The moment you discover your
file is corrupted, you’ll also find that your backup program has been dili-
gently copying and saving the same corrupted version of your file. 
✦Deleted from removable media: A third way you can lose data is by
deleting it from removable media such as a USB flash drive or digital
camera flash memory card (such as a Compact Flash or Secure Digital
card). Most likely, your backup programs protect only your hard drive
files, not any removable storage devices, which means you could take
twenty priceless pictures of your daughter’s wedding, only to delete all
those pictures by mistake. Because your backup program might never
have saved those files, you can’t recover them at all.
In all three situations, backup programs can’t help you, so you might need to
rely on special data-recovery programs instead. Data-recovery programs
work by taking advantage of the way computers store and organize files by
physically placing them in certain areas, such as in one area of a hard drive. 
To keep track of where each file is stored, computers maintain a directory
that tells the computer the names of every file and the exact physical loca-
tion where file is stored. When different programs, such as word processors
or spreadsheets, need to find and open a file, these programs first look at
this directory so they know where to find a file.
When you delete a file, the computer simply removes that file’s name from
the directory. However, your file still physically exists on the disk surface,
but the computer can’t find it again. So data-recovery programs basically
ignore the directory listing of a disk and search for a file by examining every
part of the entire storage device to find your missing files.
If you didn’t add any files since you last deleted the file you want to retrieve,
a data-recovery program will likely retrieve your entire file again. If you
saved and modified files since you last deleted a particular file, there’s a
good chance any new or modified files might have written over the area that
contains your deleted file. In this case, your chances of recovering the entire
file intact drops rapidly over time. 
If a hardware failure corrupts a file, it might mean that all or part of your file
gets wiped out for good. However, in many cases, a hardware failure won’t
physically destroy all or part of a file. Instead, a hardware failure might phys-
ically scramble a file, much like throwing a pile of clothes all over the room.
In this case, the file still physically exists, but the directory of the disk won’t
know where all the parts of the file have been scattered. So, to the computer,
your files have effectively disappeared.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Protecting 
Your Data
Working with Data-Recovery Programs
653
A data-recovery program can piece together such scattered files by examin-
ing the physical surface of a disk, gathering up file fragments, and putting
them back together again like Humpty Dumpty. Depending on how badly cor-
rupted a file might be, collecting file fragments and putting them back
together again can recover an entire file or just part of a file, but sometimes
recovering part of a file can be better than losing the whole file.
Even if you format and erase your entire hard drive, your files may still phys-
ically remain on the hard drive, making it possible to recover those files.
Some popular data-recovery programs include:
✦FileSalvage and CameraSalvage (www.subrosasoft.com): FileSalvage
retrieves deleted and corrupted files; CameraSalvage recovers deleted
files from flash memory cards.
✦Stellar Phoenix Macintosh and Stellar Phoenix Photo Recovery
(www.stellarinfo.com): Stellar Phoenix Macintosh retrieves deleted
and corrupted files. Stellar Phoenix Photo Recovery recovers deleted
files from flash memory cards.
✦Klix (www.joesoft.com): Specialized program for recovering lost digi-
tal images stored on flash memory cards like Secure Digital or Compact
Flash cards. 
The art of computer forensics
Most anything you store on your Mac can be
recovered, given enough time and money.
When most people lose data, they’re thankful
when a data-recovery program can retrieve
their files. However, in the criminal world,
people may want to delete files so that nobody
can ever find them again to hide evidence. To
retrieve such deleted files, law enforcement
agencies rely on something called computer
forensics.
The basic idea behind computer forensics is to
make an exact copy of a hard drive and then try
to piece together the deleted files on that copy
of the original hard drive. Some criminals have
lit hard drives on fire, poured acid on them, and
sliced them apart with a buzz saw — and law
enforcement agencies can still manage to read
and recover the files from the slivers of hard
drive fragments that contain the magnetic
traces of the original files. 
The good news is that if you can’t recover a file
yourself by using a data-recovery program, you
can often hire a professional service that can
recover your data for you. The bad news is that
if you have any information on your hard drive
that you want to keep secret, there will always
be a way to find and recover your data no
matter how much you try to destroy it.

✦Data Rescue II (www.prosofteng.com): This program recovers and
retrieves data from a hard drive that your Mac can no longer access due
to a hard disk failure.
✦Mac Data Recovery (www.datarecoverymac.com): This program spe-
cializes in recovering files from corrupted or reformatted hard drives.
One data-recovery program might be able to retrieve files that a second
data-recovery program cannot. 
Encrypting with FileVault
Sometimes your biggest threat isn’t from hardware failure or accidentally
deleting your data, but from the prying eyes of others who want to peek at
your data. To protect your data, you can take one or more of the following
steps:
✦Physically lock your Mac behind closed doors (armed guards optional).
✦Make sure everyone using your Mac has his or her own separate
account (see Book I, Chapter 7 for more information about creating
accounts).
✦Encrypt your files by using the Mac’s built-in encryption program called
FileVault.
Encryption physically scrambles your files so that even if people can access
your files, they can’t open or edit them unless they know the correct pass-
word. Encryption can’t stop someone from copying your files, but it can stop
someone from using your files. When you use FileVault, your Mac encrypts
your entire home folder that contains your folders such as Documents,
Music, and Pictures.
FileVault uses an encryption algorithm called Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES), which is the latest American government standard for scrambling
data that even national governments with supercomputers can’t crack.
Setting up FileVault
FileVault scrambles your files so that no one lacking your password can 
read their contents. When you type in a password, you can access your files
and use them normally, but as soon as you close a file, FileVault scrambles it
once more. FileVault works in the background so that you never even see it
working.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Protecting 
Your Data
Encrypting with FileVault
655
FileVault uses your login password to encrypt your data. For added safety,
FileVault lets you set a second password, called a master password, that can
decrypt any encrypted files stored on your Mac. If you forget your login
password and your master password, your data will be encrypted forever
with no hope of unscrambling and retrieving it ever again. 
To turn on FileVault, follow these steps:
1. Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
A System Preferences window appears.
2. Click on the Security icon under the Personal category.
The Security pane appears.
3. Click the FileVault tab.
The FileVault pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-7.
4. Click the Set Master Password button.

A window appears to let you know that FileVault is encrypting your
home folder. (Be patient. This can take a while. When FileVault is done
encrypting, your Mac displays a dialog asking that you log into your
account.)
When FileVault is turned on, your Mac might run slower because it needs to
take time to decrypt and encrypt files as you open and close them.

T
he iCal program lets you track appointments and tasks that you need to
do. To help separate your different appointments, such as personal and
business appointments, you can create separate calendars so that you can
see which days you’ll be busy for work and which days you’ll be busy for
your personal schedule. 
Using calendars might seem simple, but they can be a powerful tool to
organize your schedule, track your time, and help you plan your goals. The
more efficiently you can use your time, the more you’ll get done and the
faster you can reach your goals. Given these incentives, it only makes sense
to invest a little time in discovering how your Mac can save you a lot of time
in the long run.
Understanding iCal 
The iCal window displays the following items, as shown in Figure 2-1:
✦Calendar List: Displays all calendars that contain related appointments
such as Home or Work-related events
✦Mini-Month: Displays the dates for an entire month so you can see
which day a specific date falls on, such as Tuesday or Saturday
✦Events: Shows events scheduled in Day, Week, or Month views 
✦To Do list: Displays tasks that you need to accomplish

Working with the Calendar List
660
I go into more detail about each of these items in the following sections.
Any scheduled activity, such as a doctor’s appointment, a business meeting,
or your daughter’s soccer practice, is called an event.
Working with the Calendar List
The iCal program initially includes a Home and Work calendar, but you can
always create or rename additional calendars. You might want an additional
calendar for a specific work or home-related project, or you might need a sep-
arate calendar to help you track all of your children’s scheduled activities.
The Calendar List displays all the different calendars you’ve created, as well as
the Home and Work calendars provided by iCal. The Calendar List has two uses:
✦To select a calendar to view (which appears in the middle pane of the
iCal window)
✦To hide or display events stored on a particular calendar
When you want to store an event, you must first choose which calendar to
use. The main reason to have separate calendars is to organize and sort your
various events into calendar types. For example, the provided iCal Home 
calendar is for storing personal events, and the Work calendar is for storing
business-related events.

Working with the Calendar List
661
By selecting or deselecting the check box next to each calendar in the
Calendar List, you can selectively view specific events, such as only business
events. Or you can view both business and personal events together.
The following sections give you the lowdown on managing your calendars 
in iCal.
Creating a new calendar
Although iCal provides a Home and Work calendar, you might need to create
additional calendars for other purposes. To create a new calendar, follow
these steps:
1. Double-click the iCal icon in the Applications folder to load iCal.
2. Choose File➪New Calendar or right-click in the Calendar List and
when a pop-up menu appears, choose New Calendar.
An Untitled calendar appears in the Calendar List, as shown in Figure 2-2.
3. Type a descriptive name for your calendar and press Return.
Creating a new calendar group
Rather than create a bunch of separate calendars, you might want to organize
multiple calendars in a group. For example, if you had a calendar to schedule
events for your son and daughter, you could put both of those calendars into
a group called Family. 
Grouping not only helps you see the relationships between calendars, but it also
lets you hide grouped calendars to avoid cluttering up the Calendar List. When
you hide a calendar group, you also hide all calendars stored within that group.
Figure 2-2:
A new
calendar
appears
without a
name.

Working with the Calendar List
662
A calendar group can’t store events; it simply stores one or more calendars.
To create a calendar group, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the iCal icon in the Applications folder to load iCal.
2. Choose File➪New Calendar Group or right-click in the Calendar List.
3. From the pop-up menu that appears, choose New Group.
A calendar group appears in the Calendar List with a triangle to its left,
which you click to hide or show any grouped calendars.
4. Type a descriptive name for your group and press Return.
Adding a new calendar to a group
After you’ve created a group, you can add new calendars to the group by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. In the Calendar List, click the group name to which you want to add a
new calendar.
2. Choose File➪New Calendar.
A new calendar appears indented under the group.
3. Type a descriptive name for your new calendar and press Return.
Moving an existing calendar to a group
If you have an existing calendar that you want to move into a group, follow
these steps:
1. Move the cursor over a calendar, in the Calendar List, that you want
to move into a group.
2. Hold down the mouse button, drag the mouse over the group where
you want to move the calendar, and release the mouse button.
Your existing calendar now appears indented under the group.
Moving a calendar out of a group
In case you don’t want a calendar in a group, you can move it out of a group
by following these steps:
1. Move the cursor over a calendar, in the Calendar List, that appears
indented under a group.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Managing Your
Time with iCal
Working with the Calendar List
663
2. Hold down the mouse button, drag the mouse over the CALENDARS
title, and release the mouse button.
Your existing calendar now appears outside of any groups.
Moving a calendar or group
To help organize your calendars and groups, you might want to rearrange
their order in the Calendar List by following these steps:
1. Move the cursor over the calendar or group you want to move.
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse up or down. 
A thick horizontal line appears where your calendar or group will appear
in the Calendar List, as shown in Figure 2-3.
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new location of
your calendar or group.
Renaming and deleting calendars and groups
At any time, you can rename a calendar or group. The name of a calendar 
or group is for your own benefit and has no effect on the way iCal works. To
rename a calendar or group, just double-click a calendar or group name,
which highlights that name. Type a new name and press Return.
If you find that you no longer need a particular calendar or group, click the
one you want to delete and choose Edit➪Delete. If you have any events
stored on a calendar, a dialog appears, asking whether you really want to
delete that calendar or group. Click Delete. If you delete a calendar or group
by mistake, choose Edit➪Undo or press Ô+Z.
Figure 2-3:
A horizontal
line shows
where your
calendar or
group will

Using the Mini-Month
664
When you delete a calendar, you also delete any events stored on that calen-
dar. When you delete a group, you delete all calendars stored in that group
along with all events stored on those calendars. Make sure you really want
to delete a calendar or group of calendars. 
Using the Mini-Month
The Mini-Month is a miniature view of the current month that lets you see
which days fall on specific dates. You can also use the Mini-Month display to
switch to a different day or week within the Day or Week view displayed in
the right pane of the iCal window. You can hide or show the Mini-Month by
choosing View➪Show/Hide Mini Months or by clicking the View/Hide Mini-
Month icon that appears in the bottom-left corner of the iCal window.
Creating and Modifying Events
An event is anything that gobbles up time, usually starting at a predictable
time and (you hope!) ending at an equally predictable time. Some common
types of events are meetings, appointments with clients, times when you
need to pick someone up (such as at the airport), or recreational time such
as a Saturday night date. If you know a particular event will occur on a spe-
cific day and time, you can store that event in an iCal calendar so that you
won’t forget or schedule something else in that same time period.
Viewing events
The iCal program shows all the events you’ve scheduled for that day, week,
or month. To change the time frame of your displayed events, click the Day,
Week, or Month button. Figure 2-4 shows each of the views available.
Creating an event
To store an event, you need to decide which calendar to store the event on,
what date and time to schedule the event, and how long you think the event
will last. To create an event, follow these steps:
1. In the Calendar List, click a calendar in which you want to store the
event.
2. Click the Day, Week, or Month button at the top of the iCal window.
If you click either the Day or Week button, you can define the starting
and ending times for your event. If you choose the Month button, you
can create an event but cannot define the start and ending time.

3. Double-click a time (in the Day or Week view) or day (in the Month)
view where you want to place an event.
A New Event color-coded box appears, as shown in Figure 2-5.
4. Type a description of your event and press Return.
If you’re in the Day or Week view, you can define the start and end time of an
event by moving the mouse cursor to the top or bottom of an event until it
turns into a two-way pointing arrow. Hold down the mouse button and move
it up or down to define your start and end times in 15-minute increments.
Moving an event
In case you stored an event at the wrong date or time, you can always move
it to a new date and time by following these steps:
1. Move the cursor over the middle of the event box.
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the cursor to a new time or date.
The event moves with the cursor.
3. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new date and
time of the event.
Duplicating an event
If a particular event occurs more than once, you could type the event multi-
ple times, but why spend all that effort? Instead, you can create an event and
duplicate it so you can move the duplicate to another date. To duplicate 
an event, just click it and choose Edit➪Duplicate or press Ô+D. When the
duplicate appears, move the cursor over it, drag the event to a new date,
and release the mouse button.

Editing an event
Editing an event lets modify an event by changing the time, the date, or its
description. You can also add features to an event such as setting an alarm
or automatically opening a file. 
Changing the description of an event
Each time you create an event, you need to type in a description of that
event. To modify this description, follow these steps:
1. Click the event you want to modify and choose Edit➪Edit Event or
press Ô+E.
An edit dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-6.
2. Click in the event description (in Figure 2-6, this is simply New Event).
A text box appears around the event description.
3. Use the arrow and Delete keys to edit the current event description
and type any new text. Click Done when you’re finished.
If you click the Location field, you can type a location where an event
takes place.
Creating a recurring event
For an event that occurs regularly, such as every Monday or every month,
you can create an event once and tell iCal to display that event on a recur-
ring basis. To create a recurring event, follow these steps:
Repeat pop-up menu
Figure 2-6:
The edit
dialog lets
you modify
different
parts of an
event.

Creating and Modifying Events
668
1. Create an event as described in the “Creating an event” section, ear-
lier in this chapter.
2. Choose Edit➪Edit Event or press Ô+E.
An edit dialog appears (refer to Figure 2-6).
3. Click the Repeat pop-up menu and choose an option such as Every
day or Every month.
4. (Optional) In the Repeat pop-up menu, click Custom.
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-7, letting you define specific days
for the recurring event, such as every week on Monday and Thursday.
Click OK when you’re done creating a custom recurring event.
5. In the edit dialog, click Done.
The iCal program automatically displays your recurring event through-
out the rest of the calendar until you modify the event.
Setting an alarm for an event
Scheduling an event is useless if you forget about it. That’s why the iCal pro-
gram gives you the option of setting an alarm that can notify you of upcom-
ing events. To set an alarm, you need to decide how you want the alarm to
notify you, such as displaying a message on the screen.
To set an alarm for an event, follow these steps:
1. Click an event that you want to set an alarm.
2. Choose Edit➪Edit Event or press Ô+E.
An edit dialog appears (refer to Figure 2-6).
Figure 2-7:
The Custom
option lets
you define

✦Run Script: Runs an AppleScript file that can control your Mac.
4. Click in the time pop-up menu to define when you want the alarm to
trigger, such as 15 minutes or 1 hour before the event.
5. (Optional) Depending on the alarm type you chose, you might have
other pop-up menus that appear to let you choose how to use your
alarm. Adjust the settings as desired.
6. Click Done.
Moving an event to another calendar
You can always move an event from one calendar to another, such as your Work
to Home calendar. To move an event to another calendar, follow these steps:
1. Click an event that you want to modify.
2. Choose Edit➪Edit Event or press Ô+E.
An edit dialog appears (refer to Figure 2-6).
3. Click in the Calendar pop-up menu and choose the calendar name in
which you want the event to appear.
4. Click Done.
Adding information to an event
To prepare for an event, you can also store information about that event’s
location, attendees, any important files related to the event (such as a pres-
entation), a Web site address, and any additional notes you want to jot down.
To add information to an event, follow these steps:
1. Click an event that you want to modify.
2. Choose Edit➪Edit Event or press Ô+E.
An edit dialog appears (refer to Figure 2-6).

Finding Events
670
3. Choose one or more of the following:
✦Location: Fill in the Location field to remind yourself where an event
will take place.
✦Attendees: Click in the Attendees field to type the names of people
associated with an event.
✦Attachments: Click the Add link to attach a file to an event, such as a
business presentation that you’ll need to give at the event.
✦URL: Click and type a Web site address that’s relevant to your meet-
ing, such as a competitor’s Web site that you want to talk about
during the event.
✦Note: Click and type any additional notes about your event.
4. Click Done.
Deleting an event
When you no longer need to remind yourself of an event, you can delete it.
To delete an event,, just click it and choose Edit➪Delete. If you delete an
event by mistake, press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo to retrieve your event.
Finding Events
Storing events is only as useful as the ability to view upcoming events again
so you can prepare for them. To help you find and view events, iCal offers
several different methods that include using colors to identify different types
of events to letting you search for a specific event by name.
Color-coding events
To help identify which events belong to which calendars, you can assign a
color to every calendar in your Calendar List. So if you assign the color blue
to your Home calendar and the color red to your Work calendar, you can
quickly identify which events on your calendar are Home-related (the blue
ones) or Work-related (the red ones). 
To assign a color to a calendar, click a calendar in the Calendar List and choose
File➪Get Info or press Ô+I. In the Info dialog that appears (see Figure 2-8),
just click the color pop-up menu, click on a color, and click OK. All events
stored on that calendar now appear in the color you chose.
Use contrasting colors for multiple calendars to make it easy to tell which
events belong to which calendar. 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Managing Your
Time with iCal
Finding Events
671
Selectively hiding events
Normally, iCal displays all events, color-coding them so that you can tell
which events belong to which calendars. However, if you have too many
events, you might find that mixing Home and Work events can seem too con-
fusing. If you want to see only events stored on a specific calendar (such as
Home or Work calendars), you can hide events stored on other calendars.
To hide events stored on other calendars, deselect the check box of any of
those calendars in the Calendar List. To view events stored on calendars,
make sure a check mark appears in the check box of that calendar, as shown
in Figure 2-9.
Checking for today’s events
Probably the most important events you need to worry about are the ones
you’ve scheduled for today. To see all events scheduled for today, click the
Day or Week button at the top of the iCal window and then choose View➪
Go to Today.
Another quick way to review any upcoming events for today is to use the
Calendar widget in Dashboard. To display today’s events in the Calendar
widget, click the current date (which appears in the left pane) of the Calendar
widget until the events pane appears, as shown in Figure 2-10. (For more
information about Dashboard, see Book VI, Chapter 4.)
Checking events for a specific date
Sometimes you might need to know whether you have any events scheduled
on a certain date. To check a specific date, click the Day or Week button at
the top of the iCal window and then choose View➪Go to Date.
The Month view can show you the events scheduled for a particular date,
but the Day and Week views can show you the specific times of your events
for that day.

The Info
dialog lets
you edit a

Finding Events
672
Searching for an event
If you scheduled an event several days ago, you might forget the exact date
of that event. To help you find a specific event, iCal lets you search for it by
typing all or part of the information stored in that event, such as the event
name, the attendee names, or any notes you have stored about an event. 
To search for an event, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner of the iCal
window.
2. Type as much text as you can remember about the event you want to
find, such as an attendee’s name or the location of the event.
The iCal program displays a list of events that match the text you typed.
The list appears below the calendar, as shown in Figure 2-11.

Making a To Do List
A To Do list typically contains goals or reminders of important tasks that you
want to accomplish usually by a specific date or time. By reviewing your To
Do list every day, you can stay focused on achieving the goals that are most
important to you so that you don’t waste time accomplishing tasks that
won’t get you any closer to your goals.
Viewing and hiding the To Do list
You can view your To Do list and then hide it to make more room for viewing
your events. To show the To Do list, choose View➪Show To Do List. The To
Do list appears on the right side of the iCal window.
To hide the To Do list from view, choose View➪Hide To Do List. This tucks
the To Do list out of sight once more. By default, iCal hides the To Do list.
Another way to hide or display the To Do list is to click the pushpin icon at
the bottom-right corner of the iCal window.

Adding tasks to the To Do list
When you add a task to your To Do list, you must assign it to a calendar so
that it appears color-coded, like an event. By color-coding your To Do tasks,
you can identify which tasks might be Work-related and which might be
related to any other calendars you might have created.
To add a task to the To Do list, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Show To Do List. (Skip this step if the To Do list is
already visible.)
2. Click a calendar that you want to assign a task to, such as the Work or
Home calendar. 
3. Double-click in any blank space in the To Do list.
A blank To Do task appears, color coded to match the calendar you
chose in Step 2.
4. Type a description of your task and press Return.
Your chosen task appears in the To Do list.
Setting due dates for your To Do list tasks
It’s a good idea to place due dates on your To Do list tasks so that way you’ll
have a deadline, which can spur you into taking action to achieve your goal.
If you don’t put a due date on a task, it’s much easier to fool yourself into
thinking you’re working toward your goals when you’re really not.
To assign a due date to a To Do task, follow these steps:
1. Click a task in the To Do List.
2. Choose Edit➪Edit To Do (or press Ô+E).
An edit dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-12.
3. Select the Due Date check box. When you select the Due Date check box,
a date appears so that you can type a month, day, and year for the due
date; then click Done.
Prioritizing your To Do list
Not all tasks are equally important. To prioritize your tasks, click the priori-
tize button that appears to the right of a task in the To Do list. A pop-up
menu appears, from which you can choose None, Low, Medium, or High, as
shown in Figure 2-13. Then click the To Do pop-up menu (the gray button at
the top of the To Do window that contains the text “To Do Items by Priority”)
and choose Sort By Priority, as shown in Figure 2-13. This option puts your
High priority tasks at the top of your To Do List.

Completing, editing, and deleting To Do tasks
Completing tasks can give you a sense of accomplishment. Rather than delete
a completed task, you can mark it as complete instead. To mark a task as com-
plete, select the check box that appears to the left of a task in the To Do list.
After you’ve created a task, you can always edit it later to correct any mis-
spellings or to modify a task. To edit a To Do task, follow these steps:
1. Double-click a task.
An edit dialog appears (refer to Figure 2-12).

2. Click in the top text box and type a new description of your task, or
use the arrow and Delete key to edit the existing text.
3. Click Done.
When you’re done with a task, you’ll eventually want to delete it to avoid clut-
tering up your To Do List. To delete a task, click the task and choose Edit➪
Delete. If you accidentally delete a task, you can retrieve it by pressing Ô+Z
or choosing Edit➪Undo.
Managing iCal Files
The iCal program stores files in a special file format called iCalendar (which
uses the .ics file extension). Because the iCalendar file format is consid-
ered a standard for storing calendar information, you can share your calen-
dar files with any program that recognizes the iCalendar format, including
Microsoft Outlook. 
Exporting iCal data
To share your calendars with other programs (even those running on other
operating systems such as Windows or Linux), you need to export your iCal
file by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export.
A dialog appears, giving you a chance to choose a filename and location
to store your iCal data, as shown in Figure 2-14.
2. Click in the Save As text box and type a name for your file.
3. Click the drive and folder where you want to save your exported file. 
4. Click Export.

Importing iCal data
If you have calendar information stored in another program, you have to save
that data as an iCal file or in a vCal file. If you’ve been using Microsoft Entou-
rage, you can save your Entourage calendar information as a separate file.
After you’ve saved calendar data from another program, you can import that
file into iCal by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import.
An Import dialog appears, asking you to define what type of file format
you want to import into iCal.
2. Click a radio button to define the file format, such as Import an iCal
File, and click Import.
An Import dialog appears, displaying three options for importing iCal,
vCal, or Entourage data.
3. Click the drive and folder that contains the file you want to import.
4. Click the file you want to import and click Import.
The iCal program imports your chosen file.
Backing up iCal data and restoring a backup file
Because iCal can store all your upcoming events (appointments, meetings,
and so on), disaster could strike if your hard drive fails and wipes out your
iCal data. For that reason, you should always keep a backup copy of your
iCal data. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Back Up iCal.
The Save dialog appears.
2. Click in the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your iCal
backup file.
3. Click the drive and folder where you want to save your iCal backup file.
4. Click Save.
It’s a good idea to save your iCal backup file on a separate drive, such as an
external hard drive. That way if your Mac hard drive fails, you won’t lose
both your original iCal data and your backup file at the same time. For more
details on backing up files, see Chapter 1 of this minibook.
To retrieve your schedule from a backup file that you created earlier, choose
File➪Restore iCal. In the Open dialog that appears, click the drive and folder
where you saved your backup iCal file. Then click Open. A dialog appears,

Managing iCal Files
678
asking whether you want to replace your current iCal data with the contents
of the backup file. Click Restore, and your backup data now appears in iCal.
Printing an iCal file
Even if you have a laptop, you can’t always have your computer with you, so
you might want to print your calendar in the Day, Week, or Month view. That
way you can review it during the day and make sure you’re sticking to your
schedule.
To print a calendar, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print.
A Print dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-15.
2. Click the View pop-up menu and choose Day, Week, or Month.
3. (Optional) Change any other settings, such as the paper size or time
range that you want to view.
4. Click Continue.
Another Print dialog appears.
6. Click the Printer pop-up menu, choose a printer, and click Print.

 Managing your Address Book
M
ost people write down important names and contact information in
an address book, but your Mac comes with an electronic version
called (surprise!) the Address Book. Besides storing names and contact
information, the Address Book also connects with other programs so that
you can click someone’s e-mail address and immediately write and send a
message to that person. 
The Mac Address Book also lets you search through stored names and 
print them as mailing labels or lists, which is impossible to do with a paper
address book. So the next time you need to store names and contact infor-
mation, you’ll find it’s much easier to store this data in the Address Book on
your Mac.
Storing Names
The Address Book acts like a giant Rolodex file that can hold names and
contact information including e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and
postal addresses in separate windows referred to as cards. When you save
information about a person on a card, you can find that information again.
Designing a template
Each time you add a name, the Address Book displays blank fields, with
each field representing information to fill in about that person, such as 
company, first and last name, title, and e-mail address. You might not want
or need to store all that information about everyone, so you can define 
the Address Book template to list only the fields you want to use, such as
name and e-mail address. To modify the Address Book template, follow
these steps:

Storing Names
680
1. Start the Address Book program by clicking the Address Book icon in
the Dock.
If the Address Book icon doesn’t appear in the Dock, you have to double-
click the Address Book icon inside the Applications folder.
2. Choose Address Book➪Preferences.
A Preferences window appears.
3. Click the Template icon.
The Template window appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
4. Find a field you don’t want to store and click the minus sign to the left
of the field to remove it, repeating this for every field you want to
remove.
5. Click in the Add Field menu and choose a field to add, such as URL or
Birthday (see Figure 3-2), repeating this for each field you want to add.
6. (Optional) Click the Phone icon to make the Phone window appear, as
shown in Figure 3-3. 
7. Click in the Formats pop-up menu, choose the way you want your
phone numbers to appear, and click the Close button of the Phone
window.

ual cards later.
Storing names
After you’ve defined a template for your Address Book, the next step is to store
actual names and contact information. To add a name, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Card.
The Address Book window displays a blank card for you to fill in, as

2. Click in the fields, such as Name or Telephone Number, and enter the
information you want to save.
You don’t need to fill in every field. 
3. Click the Edit button at the bottom of the Address Book window to
save your new card.
Displaying companies and people
You have two ways to display a person’s card: by the person’s name or by
company name. To help you differentiate between company and people
names, the Address Book displays different icons to the left of each name, as
shown in Figure 3-5.
One card, identified by the My Card icon, always represents your own infor-
mation. To define a different card to represent you, click that card and
choose Card➪Make This My Card. To view your card at any time, choose
Card➪Go to My Card.
When you create a new card, the Address Book assumes that you want to
display that card by a person’s name. To make a card appear in the Address
Book by company name instead, click the card and choose Card➪Mark as 
a Company. Your chosen card now displays a company name and icon. To
change a company back into a person’s name, choose Card➪Mark as a
Person.
Editing a card
Information on cards will need to change whenever people change their
address or company. To keep this information up to date, you can edit a card
by following these steps:

Creating Groups
685
Searching names
The more names you store in your Address Book, the harder it can be to find
the name you want. Rather than scrolling through and searching for names
yourself, you can search for specific names by following these steps:
1. Click in the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner of the Address
Book window.
2. Type a word or phrase that you want to find, such as a person’s name
or company that person works for.
The Address Book displays a list of cards that match the text you typed.
3. Click a name to display all the information about that person or 
company.
Deleting a name
Periodically, you should browse through your Address Book and prune the
names of people you don’t need to save any more. To delete a name from
your Address Book, just click the name and choose Edit➪Delete Card. If you
accidentally delete a name, press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo to restore it.
If you hold down the Ô key, you can click and choose multiple names to
delete. If you hold down the Shift key, you can click two names and select
those two names and all names in between as well.
Creating Groups
To help you find all the names you’ve stored, the Address Book program lets
you organize your list of names into groups, such as for your co-workers,
friends, family members, political party associates, and so on. For greater
convenience, you can even store the same name in multiple groups.
Although you don’t have to use groups, this feature can help you manage
your list of important names and contact information.
Your Address Book initially contains two groups: All and Directories. The All
group automatically stores all names you’ve saved in the Address Book. The
Directories group contains a list of names of everyone connected to a local
area network. If you’re using a Mac at home without a local area network, the
Directories group will be empty.
Creating a group
You can create as many groups as you want, but each time you create a new
group, you have to add names to that group. To create a new group,, just
choose File➪New Group. When the decidedly generic “Group Name” appears

Creating Groups
686
in the Address Book window, type a more descriptive name in its place and
press Return.
A new group will, of course, initially be empty until you start adding names
to it. To add names to a group, follow these steps:
1. Click the All folder in the Group column to see all the names stored in
your Address Book.
2. Move the cursor over a name, hold down the mouse button, and 
drag the cursor over the group name where you want to store your
names. 
If you hold down the Ô key, you can click and choose multiple names. If
you hold down the Shift key, you can click two noncontiguous names to
select those two names and all names in between as well.
3. Release the mouse button when the group name appears highlighted. 
Your chosen name now appears in your newly created group and in the
All group.
Creating a group from a selection of names
If you already have a group of names you want to organize, you can create a
new group and store those names at the same time. To create a new group
from a selection of names, follow these steps:
1. Click the All folder in the Group column to see all the names stored in
your Address Book.
2. Hold down the Ô key and click each name you want to store in a group.
You can select a range of names by holding down the Shift key and click-
ing two noncontiguous names. Doing so selects those two names and all
names in between.
3. Choose File➪New Group from Selection.
A group called plain old “Group Name” appears under the Group cate-
gory in the Address Book window.
4. Type a more descriptive name for your group and press Return.
Your group now contains the names you selected in Step 2.
Adding names automatically with Smart Groups
Adding names manually or selecting them for a group is fine, but what if you
frequently add and delete names? Doing all this manually can get old. To
more easily keep your group’s names accurate and up to date, you can use
the Smart Group feature instead.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Storing Contact
Information in the

Creating Groups
687
With a Smart Group, you define the types of names you want to store, such
as names of everyone who works at a certain company. Then the Smart
Group automatically adds and removes any names you add to or remove
from your Address Book. 
To create a Smart Group, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Smart Group.
A dialog appears, asking for a name and rule for storing names in the
group automatically, as shown in Figure 3-8. A rule lets you store names
based on certain criteria. For example, you might want to store the
names of all people who work for Apple and live in Texas. 
2. Click in the Smart Group Name text box and type a descriptive name
for your Smart Group.
3. Click in the first pop-up menu and choose the criteria for including a
name in your Smart Group, such as Company or City, as shown in
Figure 3-9.

4. Click in the second pop-up menu and choose how to use your criteria
defined in Step 3, such as “contains” or “was updated after.”
5. Click in the text box and type a word or phrase for your criteria to use.
For example, if you want to create a Smart Group that stores only names
of people who work at Apple, your entire Smart Group rule might look
like “Company contains Apple,” as shown in Figure 3-10.
6. (Optional) Click the plus sign to the right of the text box to create any
additional rules.
If you create any additional rules and then decide you don’t want them,
you can always remove them by clicking the minus sign that appears
near the rule.
7. Click OK.
Creating a Smart Group from search results
Defining the criteria for automatically storing names into a Smart Group can
be cumbersome because you aren’t quite sure whether your defined criteria
will work exactly the way you want. As an alternative, you can use Spotlight
to search for the types of names you want to store and then create a Smart
Group based on your Spotlight search results. By doing this, you can see
exactly which types of names appear in your Smart Group.
To create a Smart Group from Spotlight search results, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner of the Address
Book window, type the text you want to find, such as the name of a
company or part of an e-mail address, and press Return.
The middle pane of Address Book shows the names found by the text
you typed into Spotlight.

Deleting a Group
If you’ve created a group and no longer need it, you can delete it. When you
delete a group, you delete only the group folder, but you do not delete any
names stored in that group. To delete a group, click the group and then
choose Edit➪Delete Group.
Managing Your Address Book Files
Eventually, your Address Book can hold so many important names and con-
tact information that you can’t afford to risk losing this information. One way
to preserve your contact information is to print your entire Address Book.
Another way is to store copies of your Address Book in other locations so
that you always have access to your important names and contact informa-
tion, even if your Mac’s hard drive gets wiped out. 
Printing your Address Book
The Address Book lets you print all or some of your contact information in
different formats, such as mailing labels or cards that you can carry with
you. To print your Address Book, follow these steps:
1. Use one of the following methods to select the names you want to
print:
✦Click one name.
✦Hold down the Ô key and click multiple names.
✦Hold down the Shift key, click a name, and then click another name
elsewhere in the list. Selecting these two names highlights them
both, along with all names in between.
✦To print all names stored in a group, click the group name, and then
choose Edit➪Select All or press Ô+A.
2. Choose File➪Print.
A Print dialog appears.
3. Expand the Print dialog by clicking the down arrow that appears to
the right of the Printer pop-up menu.
You see before you the expanded Print dialog, as shown in Figure 3-11.

4. Click in the Printer pop-up menu and choose a printer to use.
5. Click in the Styles pop-up menu and choose one of the following:
✦Mailing Labels: Prints names and addresses on different types of mail-
ing labels.
✦Envelopes: Prints names and addresses on envelopes fed into your
printer.
✦Lists: Prints your Address Book in a long list.
✦Pocket Address Book: Prints your Address Book in a condensed form
suitable for carrying with you.
Depending on the style you choose in this step, you might need to pick
additional options, such as defining the specific size of your mailing
labels or choosing whether to print names in alphabetical order.
6. Click Print.
Exporting your Address Book
Sometimes you might need to share your contact information with others.
To save one or more names from your Address Book into a file that other
programs and people can use, you export your data to a vCard or archive
format. A vCard is a standard format that many programs use to store con-
tact information. By storing your data as a vCard, you can copy information
to another program and computer, such as a Windows PC running Outlook.

your file.
6. Click the Save button.
When exporting data for use in another program, you might lose some infor-
mation, such as a person’s picture or notes you’ve written down about that
person.
Importing data into your Address Book
Other people might have important contact information that you want. To
allow you to import this information, they need to export and save the data
in one of four file formats:
✦vCards: Standard file format used to store contact information and used
by programs on different types of computers
✦LDIF: Standard data interchange file format that stands for LDAP Data
Interchange Format

Managing Your Address Book Files

any programs cram so many features that each succeeding program
version gets more bloated and harder to use. If you just want to per-
form a simple task, such as adding a few numbers together, you probably
don’t need to load a complicated program like a spreadsheet. Instead, you’d
be better off using a much simpler program specifically designed to solve a
single task.
That’s the idea behind Dashboard. Dashboard provides you with quick access
to a collection of small, single-task programs called widgets. Some typical
widgets display a calendar, weather forecasts for your city, a calculator, stock
market quotes, and movie times for your neighborhood movie theaters.
Widgets are designed to simplify your life, and Dashboard is the program that
helps you display, manage, and hide widgets. By using Dashboard, you can
be more productive without having to learn an entirely new program to do so.
Getting to Know Your Dashboard Widgets
To view your widgets, you open Dashboard by pressing the F12 key or click-
ing the Dashboard icon on the Dock. When you’re done using a widget, you
close it (and the Dashboard) the same way: by pressing F12.
As soon as you open Dashboard, you see several widgets pop into view, as
shown in Figure 4-1. The default widgets that appear are the calendar, clock,
calculator, and weather widgets.
The calendar widget lets you view dates for different months and years. The
clock widget displays the current time in a big clock, which can be easier to
read than the tiny time display in the right end of the menu bar. The calcula-
tor widget acts like a typical four-function calculator, and the weather
widget offers forecasts for different cities.

Getting to Know Your Dashboard Widgets
694
By opening Dashboard, you can check the weather, punch some numbers
into the calculator, check the time, or verify which day a particular date falls
on. After you’ve used a widget, you can hide Dashboard and all its widgets
out of sight once more.
Many widgets, including the weather forecasting widget, rely on an Internet
connection to work. If you aren’t connected to the Internet when you display
such a widget, the widget can’t display the latest information.
Moving a widget
If you don’t like the position of your widgets on the screen, you can always
move them to a new location. To move a widget, just click it and drag it to its
new position.
Customizing a widget
Some widgets always appear the same way, such as the Calculator widget.
Other widgets let you customize them to change their appearance or the
type of data it displays. To customize a widget, follow these steps:

widget, you can have to remove it from Dashboard. (Don’t worry; you can
always put it back on Dashboard again.)
Removing a widget from Dashboard
When you remove a widget from Dashboard, you don’t physically delete the
widget. Instead, you just tuck the widget in storage where you can retrieve it
again later. To remove a widget from Dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Press F12 to open Dashboard and display all your widgets.
2. Click the plus sign button that appears inside a circle in the bottom-
left corner of the screen.

5. Click the Download button of a widget that you want to download. 
Your Mac downloads your chosen widget and displays a dialog, asking
whether you want to install your newly downloaded widget in
Dashboard, as shown in Figure 4-8.
6. Click the Install button.
Dashboard appears and displays your widget on the screen. You might
want to move it to a new location. 
Disabling and Deleting Widgets from Dashboard
If you keep installing new widgets, eventually your list of available widgets
can get crowded and overwhelming. To reduce the number of available widg-
ets, you can disable or delete them.
Disabling a widget hides it from view but keeps it stored on your hard drive
in case you change your mind and later decide to display it after all. Deleting
a widget physically removes it from your hard drive.
You can’t delete the original set of widgets that come with Dashboard. You
can delete only widgets that you’ve downloaded and installed on Dashboard.
(See the previous “Finding New Widgets” section for more about download-
ing new widgets.) 
Disabling a widget
To disable a widget and temporarily remove it from view, follow these steps:
1. Press F12 to open Dashboard.
Your widgets appear on the screen.

omputers are supposed to make your life easier, but too often, they
complicate life unnecessarily. Many times you might need to perform a
repetitive task, such as renaming a batch of digital photographs every time
you copy them off your digital camera. Although such a task is trivial, it’s
also tedious and time consuming.
Fortunately, your Mac can carry some of these burdens for you automati-
cally through a feature called Automator. With Automator, you can program
your Mac to perform specific tasks that you don’t want to do yourself. 
Understanding Automator
Automator lets you choose from a library of predefined tasks, called actions,
which tell specific programs on your Mac what to do. By stringing these
actions together, you can create simple programs that can, for example,
retrieve a Web page and read the text out loud, or rename groups of files
automatically. 
Automator organizes its library of actions into the categories:
✦Calendar: Adds, deletes, or retrieves items from iCal.
✦Contacts: Finds and retrieves names from the Address Book.
✦Files & Folder: Manipulates items within the Finder.
✦Fonts: Adds, retrieves, and deletes fonts from the Font Book.
✦Internet: Retrieves Web pages from the Internet using Safari.
✦Mail: Finds and retrieves messages from Mail.

Understanding Automator
706
✦Movies: Plays, converts, or retrieves images using iDVD, DVD Player, and
QuickTime Player.
✦Music: Manipulates songs in iTunes and on an iPod.
✦PDF: Renames, searches, converts, and retrieves data from PDF files.
✦Photos: Manipulates digital photographs.
✦Presentations: Plays and displays slides in a Keynote presentation.
✦Text: Manipulates text within the TextEdit program.
✦Utilities: Provides a variety of tasks for burning CDs/DVDs and running
or quitting programs. Also contains the Watch Me Do task, which lets
you record mouse and keyboard actions.
✦Other: Provides tasks for manipulating Keynote and other programs that
work with Automator, such as Omni Outliner. 
Actions need to accept input. So, for example, if you create an action that
retrieves a Web page off the Internet, its input would be a specific Web site
address, such as www.dummies.com. You can also make an action more 
flexible, such as by having it ask a user for input or retrieve input from
another action.
After an action receives input, it does something with that input, such as
renaming files a certain way or running a program. Many actions also create
some form of output, which can be used by another action as input. Figure
5-1 shows two simple actions. The first action, Get Specified Text, retrieves a
chunk of text. The second action, Speak Text, uses a computer-synthesized
voice to read the text.
Actions link together based on compatible input and output. An action that
produces text as output can link to another action that accepts text as input.
However, an action that produces text as output won’t link properly to
another action that accepts a PDF file as input. The output from one action
must always be compatible with the input of another action. If the output
and input of two actions aren’t compatible, Automator won’t display the con-
necting input and output links between actions.
When using Automator, you’ll need to understand the Automator user inter-
face. The left pane displays Automator’s library of actions. By clicking on a
library, the middle pane lists specific actions stored in that library. 
Clicking on an action displays a brief description in the bottom left corner of
the Automator window. The right pane is where you drag and drop actions
to link actions together and form a complete Automator program. The spe-
cific order that you arrange actions to create your program is called a 
workflow.

Chapter 5

Your Mac
Understanding Actions
707
Understanding Actions
To create a workflow, you need to arrange actions together. However, even
though Automator provides many different types of actions, not every action
can link together. To help you understand the variety of actions available,
actions typically work with one of four types of objects:
✦Files and folders
✦Music (audio) files
✦Digital photographs
✦Text
To work on different objects such as text or digital photographs, each type
of action automates a specific type of program on your Mac, such as the
Finder, iTunes, iPhoto, Safari, iCal, or TextEdit program.

Understanding Actions
708
Actions either retrieve data or process the data that another action
retrieved. Actions can retrieve data by asking the user when the workflow
runs. This method gives the workflow the flexibility to work with different
types of data, but it adds the inconvenience of not running completely auto-
matically without user intervention. 
A second way actions can retrieve data is by having you specify exactly what
type of data the action should use, such as a specific file. This method lets
your workflow run without any intervention from you, but you lose the flexi-
bility of working with different data unless you modify the action within
Automator.
Some examples of actions that retrieve data are as follows:
✦Find Sources in iTunes: Lets you define which songs or playlists to use
and outputs the song or playlist. 
✦Get Specified URLs: Retrieves a Web page from a specific URL, such 
as www.dummies.com or www.whitehouse.gov, and outputs the 
Web page.
✦Ask for Text: Displays a dialog so the user can enter an answer and out-
puts this answer.
✦Get Specified Finder Items: Retrieves the name of a file or folder and
outputs the name of a file or folder.
Actions that retrieve data must then pass that data to another action that
actually processes that data. Some actions that process data then create
output for another action to use. Other actions simply accept input and then
do something with that input, such as playing a specific song in iTunes or
rotating a digital photograph. 
The following are some examples of actions that process data:
✦Play iTunes Playlist: Accepts a playlist name and starts playing the
songs in that playlist.
✦Get Text from Webpage: Accepts a Web page, retrieves the text off that
Web page, and outputs this text.
✦Speak Text: Accepts text and reads this text in a computer-synthesized
voice.
✦Rename Finder Items: Accepts the name of a file or folder and changes
that name.
Eventually, every workflow needs to end with an action that does something
to data. In the preceding list, the Get Text from Webpage action accepts a Web
page as input and sends the text of that Web page out as output. You can’t

Book VI
Chapter 5
Automating 
Your Mac
Understanding Actions
709
end a workflow with this particular action because it doesn’t do anything
useful that you can see or hear. However, you can retrieve text from the first
Web page on Apple’s Web site and link the Get Text from Webpage action to
the Speak Text action, which reads all text from Apple’s Web page, as shown
in Figure 5-2.
Creating a workflow
The first step to creating a workflow is to pick an action that retrieves data.
To help you get started, you can have Automator create an initial action, or a
starting point action, for your workflow by following these steps:
1. Double-click the Automator icon in the Applications folder to load
Automator. (If Automator is already running, choose File➪New.)
A dialog appears, letting you choose the type of data you want to manip-
ulate, such as files, music, photos, or text, as shown in Figure 5-3.
2. Click an icon such as Files & Folders or Text.
A list of options appears, as shown in Figure 5-4.
If you click the Custom icon, Automator displays its window without any
starting point action at all.
Figure 5-2:
An action
that
processes
data can
output that
data to an
action that
actually
does some-
thing with
that data.

Understanding Actions
710
3. Select the different options for your chosen starting point and click
Choose.
The Automator window appears and displays your first action, as shown
in Figure 5-5.
The Get Content From pop-up menu lets you define where to retrieve data,
such as from a specific iTunes playlist or from a dialog asking the user to
type in text. The second pop-up menu offers variations on the choice you
picked from the Get Content From pop-up menu, such as asking you to type
in text right now or asking the user for text when the workflow runs. 
A starting point action displays pop-up menus or other ways to choose dif-
ferent options for retrieving data. In comparison, if you place an action that
processes data as your first action in a workflow, that action won’t display
any choices at all, because it expects to receive data from another action. 
Figure 5-4:
Every
starting
point action

to find data.
Figure 5-3:

Understanding Actions
711
The first action in a workflow must give you choices for defining where to
find specific data. If an action doesn’t give you choices for defining how to
get data, you can’t use that action as the first action of your workflow.
Adding, rearranging, and deleting actions
After you select an action that starts your workflow by retrieving data, you
need one or more actions that process that data. To add an action to a work-
flow, follow these steps: 
1. Click a library in the left pane of the Automator window, which con-
tains the action you want to choose.
(If you need an action that works with Text, click the Text library. If you
need an action that involves the Internet, click the Internet library.) A
list of actions, stored in your chosen library, appears in the middle pane
of the Automator window.
Click Library to view all available actions listed in alphabetical order.
Figure 5-5:
The first
action
typically
lists options
for retriev-
ing data.

712
2. Move the cursor over an action you want to use in the middle pane,
hold down the mouse button, and drag the cursor over the right pane
of the Automator window, underneath or above another action.
3. Release the mouse button.
In case you placed an action in the wrong location, you can move an action
to a new location by dragging it with the mouse or clicking the action and
choosing Action➪Move Up (or Move Down).
To delete an action, click its Close button. If you delete an action by mistake,
press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo.
Running and testing a workflow
After you’ve arranged multiple actions into a workflow, you can test your
workflow to make sure it actually works the way you want. To run a work-
flow, you have two choices:
✦Click the Run button or choose Workflow➪Run.
✦Choose Workflow➪Step.
If you run a workflow, Automator runs through every step in your workflow.
If you choose Workflow➪Step, Automator runs one action at a time. To run
each additional action, you have to choose Workflow➪Step.
The main reason for using the Step command is to en sure that each action
is doing exactly what you want at each step of your workflow. If an action
can’t run for some reason, Automator displays an error message as shown in
Figure 5-6.
To fix problems with your workflow, you might need to delete the faulty action
and replace it with another one, or you might need to add another action that
outputs the proper data that the other action can accept as input.

Saving a workflow
For any file in any program you work on, remember this motto: Save early
and save often! To save a workflow, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save.
A Save As dialog appears.
2. Click in the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your file.
3. Click in the Where pop-up menu and choose a folder in which to store
your file.
4. Click Save.
Opening a saved workflow
After you’ve saved a workflow, you can open it again by following these steps:
1. Double-click the Automator icon in the Applications folder to load
Automator if it’s not already open.
2. Click Open an Existing Workflow. (You can also choose File➪Open to
open an existing workflow.)
An Open dialog appears.
3. Click the workflow file you want to open and click Open.
Creating Example Workflows
Trying to piece together actions to create a workflow can get frustrating if
you don’t know how different actions might work. To create your own work-
flows more easily, study the following examples that manipulate text, digital
photographs, and files. 
As you can see by browsing through Automator’s libraries, there are dozens
of other types of actions that involve different types of programs such as
iCal or Address Book. Just experiment with creating workflows out of differ-
ent actions, and you’ll gradually discover more ways to control your Mac
than you ever thought possible. 
Playing with text
The following workflow consists of three actions, as shown in Figure 5-7: 
✦Get Specified URLs: Asks for a URL (such as www.cnn.com) and
retrieves the Web page from that site.
✦Get Text from Articles: Retrieves the text of RSS feeds.

Creating Example Workflows
714
✦New TextEdit Document: Displays the text of the RSS feeds in a TextEdit
document that you can read or print.

Making your Mac imitate you 
with the Watch Me Do action
Most actions represent specific tasks that various programs can do, such as
setting an event (appointment) in iCal or playing a song in iTunes. To give
you greater flexibility with your tasks, Automator also includes a unique
Watch Me Do action stored in the Utilities library.
The Watch Me Do action records your mouse or keyboard commands and
plays them back. This ability to record mouse clicks and keystrokes is simi-
lar to the macro feature found in many programs. So, for example, if you
record your mouse clicking the Safari icon on the Dock and then opening the
Applications folder to double-click the Calculator icon, the Watch Me Do
action performs these actions every time it runs.
To record mouse or keyboard commands in a Watch Me Do action, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Record button or choose Workflow➪Record.
Your Desktop appears along with an Automator Recording window, as
shown in Figure 5-15.
2. Click the mouse button or type anything that you want to record.

f you have multiple computers in the same place, you may find it conven-
ient to connect your Mac to a network. A network allows multiple com-
puters to share files. Although you could copy a file on a USB flash drive,
plug it into another computer, and copy the files on to that second com-
puter, such an approach (dubbed sneaker net) is slow and clumsy. However,
when multiple computers connect to a network, they can share files almost
as quickly and easily as copying a file from one folder to another. 
Creating a Wired Network
The simplest wired network just connects two computers together using
either a FireWire cable or a cable that conforms to a networking cable stan-
dard called Ethernet. Every Mac has a FireWire port and an Ethernet port, so
if you plug a FireWire cable or Ethernet cable into the FireWire or Ethernet
ports of two Macs, you’ll have a simple network, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Ethernet cables are often identified by the speeds that they can send data.
The earliest Ethernet cables were called Category 3 (or Cat 3) cables and
could transfer data at 10 megabits per second (Mbps). The next generation
of Ethernet cables was called Category 5 (Cat 5) cables, which could transfer
data at 100 Mbps. (A slightly improved version of the Cat 5 cable is called
Cat5e cable.) The current Ethernet cable standard is now Category 6 (Cat 6)
cables, which can transfer data at 1,000 Mbps. 
Connecting two computers can be convenient for sharing files, but most net-
works typically consist of multiple computers connected together. Such a
large network of multiple computers allows different computers to share
files with each other. 
Because it’s physically impossible to connect more than two computers
together through a single cable, networks typically use something called a hub.
Each computer connects to the hub, which indirectly connects each computer
to every other computer also connected to the hub, as shown in Figure 1-2.
An improved variation of a hub is called a switch. Physically, a hub and a
switch both connect multiple computers in a single point (as shown in
Figure 1-2).
With a hub, a network acts like one massive hallway that every computer
shares. If a bunch of computers are transferring data at the same time, the
shared network can get crowded with data flowing everywhere, slowing the
transfer of data throughout the network.
With a switch, the switch directs data between two computers, which is like
having a traffic cop directing traffic as opposed to letting cars fight each
other on a road. As a result, a switch can ensure that data transfers quickly
regardless of how much data the other computers on the network are trans-
ferring at the time.
A variation of a switch is called a router, which often adds a firewall. Because
routers cost nearly the same as ordinary hubs and switches, most wired net-
works rely on routers. So if you want to create a wired network of comput-
ers, you just need
✦Two or more computers
✦A network switch
✦Enough cables to connect each computer to the network switch
The speed of a wired network depends entirely on the slowest speed of the
components used in your network. If you plan on using Cat 6 cables in your
network, make sure your network switch is designed for Cat 6 cables. If not,
you’ll have the fastest Ethernet cables connected to a slow network switch,
which will run only as fast as the slowest part of your network.

Creating a Wireless Network
727
Creating a Wireless Network
Because wired networks can be so inflexible, more people are setting up
wireless networks instead. Essentially a wireless network is no different than
a wired network, except (no surprise here) that there are no wires and wire-
less networks tend to be a bit slower and have problems with interference of
the wireless signals from one part of a building to another. 
Due to physical obstacles, wireless networks don’t always reach certain
parts of a room or building, creating “dead spots” where you can’t connect
wirelessly. Walls or furniture can disrupt the wireless signals.
All you need is a device called an access point, which can plug into your
existing wired network. This access point broadcasts a signal that other
computers can receive, creating a wireless connection to the network, as
shown in Figure 1-3. You can even sit outside of a building and access a wire-
less network from the comfort of a lawn chair.

Creating a Wireless Network
728
Not all wireless networks are alike. The earliest wireless networks followed a
technical specification called 802.11b or 802.11a. Newer wireless equipment
followed a faster wireless standard called 802.11g, and now the latest stan-
dard (at the time of this writing) is called 802.11n. When setting up a wireless
network, make sure your wireless access point uses the same wireless stan-
dard as the wireless adapter plugged into each of your computers. In case all
this technical jargon about 802.11 standards has your head swimming, just
buy Apple’s Airport or Airport Extreme, which is guaranteed to work with all
the latest Mac computer models. (The Airport Extreme is the faster wireless
access point that uses the 802.11n standard.)
At the time of this writing, the Airport Extreme base station uses a draft ver-
sion of the 802.11n wireless standard, which means 802.11n wireless
adapters sold by other companies might not work correctly with Apple’s
Airport Extreme. 
The hazards of wireless networking
To access a wired network, someone must
physically connect a computer to the network
using a cable. However, connecting to a wire-
less network can be done from another room,
outside a building, or even across the street. 
As a result, wireless networks can be much
less secure because a wireless network essen-
tially shoves dozens of cables out the window,
so anyone can walk by and connect into the
network.
The practice of connecting to unsecured wire-
less networks is known as war driving (also
war flying, war walking, or war boating,
depending on how you move around). The
basic idea behind war driving is to drive around
a city and keep track of which areas offer an
unsecured wireless network. After getting con-
nected to an unsecured wireless network, an
intruder can wipe out files or interfere with the
network.
When creating a wireless network, you have to
rely on a variety of security measures. The sim-
plest security measure is to use a password
that locks people out who don’t know the pass-
word. For further protection, you can also use
encryption.
Encryption scrambles the data sent to and 
from the wireless network. Without encryption,
anyone can intercept information sent through
a wireless network (including passwords). Still
another security measure involves configuring
your wireless network to let only specific com-
puters connect to the wireless network. By doing
this, an intruder can steal your password and
still not gain access to the wireless network
unless he or she can also gain access to one of
the wireless network’s approved computers.
Ultimately, wireless networking requires more
security measures simply because it offers
potential intruders the ability to access the net-
work without physically being in the same
building. Wireless networks can be as safe as
wired networks, but you might need to go
through a lot of extra precautions just to make
sure every part of your wireless network is as
secure as possible.

For more information about wireless networking, pick up a copy of AirPort
and Mac Wireless Networks For Dummies, by Michael E. Cohen (Wiley
Publishing).
Setting Up an Airport Extreme Base Station
Although you can use any wireless access point to create a wireless network
of Mac computers, it’s probably easier (albeit more expensive) just to buy
Apple’s Airport Extreme base station instead. The Airport Extreme base sta-
tion includes Ethernet ports along with wireless capability. That way you can
connect computers to your network using both cables and wireless technol-
ogy, essentially allowing your network to connect as many computers as
possible (as long as they can access the wireless signals, that is).

Before you can use the Airport Extreme base station, you must configure it
first by following these steps:
1. Run the Airport Utility program. (You might have to install the latest
version of this program from the CD that comes with the Airport
Extreme base station.) 
A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
2. Enter a descriptive name for your wireless network into the Wireless
Network Name text box. 
This name is purely for your own use. You could type jlKVdj%Kfj+ if you
wanted, and your Mac would be perfectly happy with this name.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your Airport base station into the Base
Station Name text box. 
This name is useful for identifying the base station, especially if you
have two or more base stations hooked up to the same network.
4. Click Continue. 
Another dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.
5. Choose a location from the Country pop-up menu.
Californians like me would choose the U.S. of A.
6. Select the 802.11n (802.11b/g compatible) radio button. 
If you know for a fact that your network uses the 802.11a standard,
select the 802.11n (802.11a compatible) radio button instead.

second time. 
11. Click Continue. 
Another dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-7.
12. Select the radio button that defines how your network connects to the
Internet. 
If you aren’t sure, don’t select any radio button. The Airport base station
will attempt to determine your Internet connection by itself.
13. Click Continue. 
Another dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-8.
14. Make sure the Using DHCP option is chosen in the Configure IPv4 pop-
up menu and click Continue. (Unless you know the specific settings to
type, use DHCP.) 
Another dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which essentially
means your Mac can usually figure out the proper settings to use so you
don’t have to type them in manually. Configuring makes sure your Mac
can connect to the Internet.

Connecting a Phone or PDA to a Mac
735
After you’ve physically connected your wired network or configured your
wireless network, you must still configure your Mac to work on that network
by sharing files and printers, which is the topic of Book VII, Chapter 2.
Connecting a Phone or PDA to a Mac
Many people store names and contact information in their mobile phones 
or personal digital assistant (PDA) handheld devices. However, such mobile,
handheld devices create two main problems. First, if you already store names,
contact information, and appointments using iCal and Address Book on your
Mac, you probably don’t want to retype this information into your mobile
device. Second, if you lose your mobile phone or PDA, you could wind up
losing all of your important contact information. 
To prevent both of these problems, your Mac comes with a program called
iSync. By using iSync, you can connect and transfer data back and forth
between your Mac and many handheld devices such as a mobile phone or
PDA. Now you can type in a name on your mobile phone, type an appoint-
ment on your Mac using Address Book, and iSync smashes all this informa-
tion together and stores your updated schedule on both your mobile phone
and your Mac. 
Besides sharing contact information and appointments between your Mac
and a handheld device, iSync also lets you transfer files from your Mac to
your handheld device. If you need to read some important documents, trans-
fer them from your Mac and store them on your PDA so you can read them
in an airport terminal, while waiting in line at the supermarket, or any time
you’re away from your Mac. 
The iSync program can work with a wide variety of mobile phones and Palm
PDAs. For a complete list of devices compatible with iSync, visit Apple’s Web
site (www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/devices.html). If you
have a Windows Mobile, a Blackberry, or an older Palm OS device, you’ll
need to buy a Missing Sync program for your particular device from Mark/
Space (www.markspace.com), which will allow you to synchronize your
data with a Mac.
The three basic steps for using iSync are
1. Add your handheld device to your Mac’s iSync Devices list. 
This links the handheld device to your Mac. The idea here is to keep
your handheld device from trying to synchronize with multiple Macs,
which could prevent contact information and appointments from being
synchronized correctly. You need to add a handheld device to your Mac
only once.

Connecting a Phone or PDA to a Mac
736
2. Connect the handheld device with your Mac. 
Handheld devices connect either through a USB cable or Bluetooth wire-
less connection.
3. Decide what to transfer or synchronize between your Mac and the hand-
held device. 
Lets you specify whether to synchronize and transfer names and contact
information, appointments, or files such as word processor or spread-
sheet files.
Adding a handheld device to your Mac
Before you can use iSync to synchronize data between your Mac and your
handheld device, you need to add the handheld device to iSync. If you have
a Palm OS device, choose Devices➪Enable Palm OS Syncing. (You’ll need to
follow additional instructions specific to getting a Palm OS device to work
with a Mac, which will appear on the screen after you choose this Enable
Palm OS Syncing command.) 
If you have a handheld device that connects using Bluetooth or a USB cable,
choose Devices➪Add Device (or press Ô+N) as shown in Figure 1-11.
In case you want to synchronize your handheld device with another com-
puter, you must first remove the device from the iSync Devices list on your
Mac by following these steps:
1. Load iSync by double-clicking the iSync icon in the Applications
folder.
2. In the iSync window, click the icon for the handheld device that you
want to remove. 
3. Choose Devices➪Remove Device.

Synchronizing a handheld device with your Mac
After you’ve added a handheld device to the iSync Devices list so your Mac
can recognize it, you can synchronize and transfer data between your Mac
and a handheld device by following these steps:
1. Connect your handheld device (mobile phone or PDA) to your Mac. (If
you have a Bluetooth handheld device, just place it near your Mac.)
2. Load iSync. 
The iSync window appears, displaying an icon for your handheld device,
as shown in Figure 1-12.
3. Click the icon of the handheld device that you want to synchronize. 
The iSync window expands to display additional options, as shown in
Figure 1-13.
4. Choose your options for synchronizing data and click the Sync
Devices icon or choose Devices➪Sync Devices.
Resetting a handheld device with your Mac
Synchronizing your handheld device with your Mac can keep your crucial
contact and appointment information stored in two locations. However,
sometimes the data on your handheld device might get hopelessly outdated
if you don’t use it for a long time, or it can get scrambled if someone acciden-
tally uses (plays) with your handheld device. 
If this happens, the only accurate information might be on your Mac, so you
can reset your handheld device, essentially wiping the handheld device
clean and loading it with the data on your Mac instead. To reset your hand-
held device, follow these steps:
1. Connect your handheld device (mobile phone or PDA) to your Mac. (If
you have a Bluetooth handheld device, just place it near your Mac.)

Chapter 2: Sharing Files and
Resources on a Network
In This Chapter
 Sharing files
 Sharing printers
 Sharing an Internet connection
P
hysically connecting multiple computers through cables or wireless
adapters might create a network, but for greater flexibility, use the net-
work so all computers can share files and equipment with other computers
connected to the network. By sharing over a network, everyone can benefit,
and the benefits can range from swapping files quickly and easily to sharing
a single printer instead of having to buy a printer for every computer.
Although networks allow others to share your files, nobody on a network
can rummage through your Mac without your permission, just as nobody
should enter your house until you invite them in. Ideally, a network should
allow you to share files and equipment over a network without risking the
loss of crucial files on your own computer. 
Sharing Files
Sharing files makes it easy for different people to work on a project. Without
a network, you could give someone a copy of a file, but then you might sud-
denly have three different versions of the same file, and nobody would know
which file contains the most accurate information. 
Even worse, two or more files could each contain different parts of the most
updated information, so now you have the problem of finding this updated
portion of each file and merging it into a single file again. Obviously, worry-
ing about multiple copies of the same file wastes time, so networks allow
everyone to work on a single file and keep one copy of that file stored in one
location. 
When your Mac is connected to a network, you have the option of sharing
one or more folders with everyone else on the network. To share folders,

Sharing Files
740
you need to define different permission levels, which allow or restrict what
users can do with a folder:
✦Read & Write: Other users have the ability to retrieve, delete, and
modify files in the shared folder.
✦Read Only: Other users can copy and open files, but they cannot modify
or delete them.
✦Write Only: Other users can only store files in the folder; they cannot
copy or open any files already stored in that folder.
✦No Access: Blocks everyone (or just certain users) from accessing files
on your Mac at all.
To share files, you need to decide which folders to share, who can access
that folder, and what access level (Read & Write, Read Only, Write Only, or
No Access) you want others to have in accessing your shared folder. 
You don’t have to share folders. If you don’t share folders, you can still use a
network by accessing files shared by other network users. 
Turning on file sharing
To turn on file sharing, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network category. 
The Sharing pane appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
3. Select the File Sharing check box in the leftmost column.
4. Click the plus sign button underneath the Shared Folders column. 
A dialog appears, displaying all the drives and folders on your Mac, as
shown in Figure 2-2.
5. Click a folder, such as the Public folder, which contains the Drop Box
folder. 
The Drop Box folder is a special folder that allows others to store or
drop files in, but it doesn’t allow anyone (except you) to view and
retrieve files back out again. A Drop Box folder essentially acts like a
mailbox that lets others drop letters (files) in but won’t let them peek
inside to read any letters (files) inside.
6. Click Add.
7. Repeat Steps 4–6 for each additional folder you want to share over the
network. 

Book VII
Chapter 2

8. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
File sharing works only as long as a computer is not turned off or in sleep
mode. If you share a folder and your Mac goes into sleep mode, other people
on the network won’t be able to access your shared folder until your Mac
wakes up again. 
Defining user access to shared folders
After you’ve defined one or more folders to share, you can also define the
type of access people can have with your shared folders, such as giving

certain people the ability to open and modify files while stopping other
people from accessing your shared files at all. 
When defining access to shared folders, you can define access for three
types of network users:
✦Yourself: Give yourself Read & Write access or else you won’t be able to
modify any files in your own shared folders.
✦Everyone: Allows others to access your shared folders as guests with-
out requiring a password.
✦Names of specific network users: Allows you to give individuals access
to your shared folders by name and password.
If you trust everyone on a network, you can give everyone Read & Write priv-
ileges to your shared folders. However, it’s probably best to give everyone
Read privileges and give only certain people Read & Write privileges. 
Defining access privileges for guests
To define access privileges for guests, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network category. 
The Sharing pane appears. 
3. Click a folder in the Shared Folders list. 
The Users list enumerates all the people allowed to access this particu-
lar shared folder, as shown in Figure 2-3. By default, every shared folder
lists your name with Read & Write privileges. 
4. Click the Everyone (the guest account) entry to call up its pop-up
menu and choose an access option, such as Read & Write, Read Only,
Write Only, or No Access. 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each additional shared folder you want to
configure.
6. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Giving individuals access to shared folders
When you define the guest account (Everyone) for a shared folder, anyone on
the network can access your files based on the access level you’ve defined
for the guest account (Read Only, Write Only, and so on). Because you might
want to give certain people greater access to your files, you can create indi-
vidual accounts and passwords for accessing a shared folder.

Bonjour is a networking standard developed by Apple, which is used by
most printers to connect to other computers through Ethernet cables (wired
networks) or through wireless connections (802.11a/b/g/n). Since Apple
released Bonjour as an open source standard, other companies have been
able to use it, which means Windows users can even download the free
Bonjour for Windows program so Windows PCs can access shared printers
on a network.

Sharing an Internet Connection
Sharing an Internet connection lets one Mac access the Internet through
another Mac. For example, one laptop Mac might have access to the Internet
through a wireless connection, but a second, older laptop Mac might not
have a wireless adapter (such as an Airport Extreme card) and would there-
fore lack access the Internet. However, with Internet Sharing turned on, the
second Mac can access the Internet through the first Mac.
To share an Internet connection, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
A System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network category. 
The Sharing pane appears.
3. Click the Internet Sharing option in the list box on the left. 
Internet Sharing options appear, as shown in Figure 2-12. 
4. Choose one of the following from the Share Your Connection From
pop-up menu:
• Built-in Ethernet: Your Mac is connected to another computer through

 Sharing through Bluetooth
B
luetooth is the name of a wireless technology standard designed 
primarily for connecting devices within a short distance of one
another, unlike networks where one computer can be in one room and
another computer in another room on another floor of the building.
Many handheld devices, such as mobile phones and handheld computers,
use Bluetooth, but you can use Bluetooth to connect two or more Macs in
what’s called a personal area network (PAN). Because of its short-range
nature, Bluetooth is handy for connecting devices for short periods of time
and for transferring small files, unlike networks that are meant to connect
computers on a more permanent basis.
Bluetooth can connect devices up to 30 feet (10 meters) away, although any
obstacles such as walls can limit the range of a Bluetooth device. 
Identifying Bluetooth Capabilities
Not every Mac has Bluetooth capabilities. If you have a newer Mac, chances
are good you have Bluetooth capability, but if you have an older Mac, you
probably don’t have Bluetooth capability built-in. In that case, you’ll need to
buy a Bluetooth adapter that plugs into a USB port or fits inside your Mac. 
To determine if your Mac has Bluetooth capability, follow these steps:
1. Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. 
A System Preferences window appears.
2. Look for a Bluetooth icon under the Hardware category. 
If you see a Bluetooth icon, your Mac has Bluetooth capability. If you
don’t see a Bluetooth icon, your Mac doesn’t have Bluetooth capability.

Configuring Bluetooth
752
Configuring Bluetooth
After you determine that your Mac has Bluetooth capability (either built-in or
added through a Bluetooth adapter), you might want to take time to configure
how Bluetooth works on your Mac. For example, you might not want to allow
other computers to browse your hard drive through Bluetooth without your
knowledge. Otherwise, it’s possible for someone to access your computer
from across the room using Bluetooth, and you would never know it. 
To configure how Bluetooth works on your Mac, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Networking category. 
The Sharing pane appears.
3. Select the Bluetooth Sharing check box. 
A list of Bluetooth options appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
4. Choose one of the following from the When Receiving Items pop-up
menu:
• Accept and Save: Automatically saves any files sent to you through
Bluetooth. (Not recommended because someone can send you a
malicious program such as a virus or Trojan Horse that could wipe
out your files when opened.)
Figure 3-1:
The Sharing
window lists
options for
Bluetooth
sharing.

753
• Accept and Open: Automatically saves and opens any files sent to 
you through Bluetooth. (Not recommended because this — like the
previous option — could automatically run a malicious program sent
to your Mac through Bluetooth.) 
• Ask What to Do: Displays a dialog that gives you the option of 
accepting or rejecting a file sent to you through Bluetooth.
• Never Allow: Always blocks anyone from sending you files through
Bluetooth.
5. Select or deselect the Require Pairing check box. 
If selected, this check box won’t let anyone send files to you until you
“pair” that other computer with your own. Pairing links another device
specifically to your Mac, which is commonly used to link Bluetooth key-
boards, mice, and the Apple Remote to a specific Mac. The next section,
“Pairing a Device,” explains how to pair a Bluetooth device with 
your Mac.
6. Choose either Documents or Other from the Folder for Accepted Items
pop-up menu. 
If you choose Other, an Open dialog appears, letting you click a folder
where you want to store any files sent to you through Bluetooth.
7. Choose one of the following from the When Other Devices Browse
pop-up menu:
• Always Allow: Automatically gives another Bluetooth device full
access to the contents of your Mac. (Not recommended, because this
allows others to mess up your files accidentally or deliberately.)
• Ask What to Do: Displays a dialog that gives you the option of accept-
ing or rejecting another device trying to access your Mac through
Bluetooth.
• Never Allow: Always blocks anyone from browsing through your Mac
using Bluetooth.
8. Select or deselect the Require Pairing check box. 
Generally, you want pairing because pairing lets you selectively choose
which devices can access your Mac through Bluetooth.
9. Choose either Public or Other from the Folder Others Can Browse
pop-up menu. 
If you choose Other, an Open dialog appears, letting you click a folder
that you can share.
10. Click the Close button of the System Preferences window. 

Pairing a Device
754
Pairing a Device
Pairing lets you determine ahead of time which Bluetooth-enabled devices
can connect to your Mac. By using pairing, you can keep total strangers from
trying to access your Mac without your knowledge. For additional security,
you can also require that paired devices use a password (also called a
passkey) that further verifies that a specific device is allowed to connect to
your Mac.
Pairing with your Mac
To pair a device with your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Bluetooth icon under the Hardware category. 
The Bluetooth pane appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
3. Click the Set Up New Device button. 
The Bluetooth Setup Assistant window appears. 
4. Click Continue. 
Another Bluetooth Setup Assistant dialog appears, asking what type of
device you want to connect to your Mac, as shown in Figure 3-3.

Removing a paired device from your Mac
After you’ve paired a device with your Mac, you might want to remove it
later. To remove a paired device from your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Bluetooth icon under the Hardware category. 
A Bluetooth pane appears, as shown in Figure 3-6, listing all devices
paired with your Mac.
3. Click to select the device you want to unlink from your Mac and then
click the minus sign button in the bottom-left corner of the Bluetooth
window. 
A dialog appears, warning you that if you disconnect this device, it will
no longer be available to your Mac.
4. Click Remove. 
Sharing through Bluetooth
Because Bluetooth lets you create a simple, short-range network between
Mac computers, you can use a Bluetooth network to share files or even an
Internet connection with others. Such a simple network isn’t meant to share
massive numbers of files or an Internet connection for a long-term basis, but
it is handy for quick file copying or browsing a Web page.
Figure 3-6:
The
Bluetooth
pane shows
you all
paired
devices on a

Sharing through Bluetooth
758
The speed of ordinary networks connected through Ethernet cables is 10,
100, or 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps), whereas the maximum speed of a
Bluetooth network is only 1 Mbps. 
Sharing files
When you need to copy a file from one computer to another, you can set up
a Bluetooth connection. Sharing files through Bluetooth allows you to trans-
fer files to another computer without the hassle of using connecting cables
or mutually compatible removable storage devices like Compact Flash cards
or USB flash drives. 
To share files through Bluetooth, follow these steps:
1. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
The Finder appears.
2. Choose Go➪Utilities. 
The contents of the Utilities folder appear.
3. Double-click the Bluetooth File Exchange icon. 
A Select File to Send window appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
4. Select a file. 
To select multiple files, hold down the Ô key and click each file you
want to send.
5. Click Send. 
A Send File window appears, listing all Bluetooth-enabled devices near
your Mac, as shown in Figure 3-8.
6. Select a Bluetooth-enabled device and click Send. 
If you choose another Mac computer to receive your files, a dialog might
appear on the receiving Mac, asking the user to accept or decline the file
transfer, as shown in Figure 3-9.
If the receiving Mac has been configured to Accept and Save or Accept and
Open transferred files, you won’t see the dialog in Figure 3-9. The dialog in
Figure 3-9 appears only if the user has selected Ask What to Do (the default
option) when configuring their Bluetooth settings.

Sharing an Internet connection
Sharing a Bluetooth Internet connection is great for letting someone browse
Web sites or retrieve e-mail through your Internet connection, but you won’t
be able to use Bluetooth for video conferencing or hosting a Web site, due to
the slower Bluetooth data transfer speeds.
