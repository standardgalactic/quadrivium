Preface
One of the best early inventory models was George Plossl’s bathtub model.
The water level in the tub represented the inventory level. Anyone could
see there were only two ways to reduce the water level, i.e., to “rightsize”
the inventory. The faucet could be shut off, stopping additional water
from ﬁlling the tub; this was analogous to shutting off purchasing. The
drain opening could be widened, allowing water to ﬂow out of the tub
more quickly; this was analogous to marketing, generating more sales.
Although modeled on a bathtub, Plossl’s model was elegant because it
exposed the basics of a complex subject.
In Rightsizing Inventory Joe Aiello exposes deeper basics about the
same complex subject, using what could be called an “ice cube tray”
analogy. Everyone can understand that when an ice cube tray is ﬁlled
with water, the total amount of water depends on the number of cubes
in the tray and the relative wall heights for each cube. Rightsizing the
total amount of water in the tray (inventory) depends on ﬁlling each of
the ice cubes (the segmentation of inventory in the supply chain) to the
desired cube height as allowed by the tray walls (the silo views of each
functional area that impact inventory). Effective inventory management
takes the end-to-end supply chain network into account. Joe does this by
detailing the real-world conﬂicts between functional areas that often
prevent sound inventory decisions. Joe describes the segmentation of
inventory both by product line and by fast turn, slow turn, and no turn
inventory components. The different inventory segments require different
control strategies. Joe explains all this from his unique inventory perspec-
tive, learned through decades of practitioner and consulting experiences.
Left unattended, many an inventory investment will spiral out of
control; Joe Aiello’s book is the complete antidote on how to wrestle

Rightsizing Inventory
inventory back into control. I could have beneﬁted greatly from Joe’s
inventory insights during those times in my own career when as a materials
manager, I was under intense pressure to rightsize the inventory! Joe
writes in ﬁrst person functional roles from a cast of characters that is right
on target. I would have responded to my peers differently had I better
understood then their functional priorities. This book presents dozens of
inventory management tips and summarizes them in management e-mails.
My team would have made better inventory decisions had we had access
then to Joe’s tips. Joe presents a consistent inventory accounting format
throughout the book to educate the reader about the basics of inventory
dynamics. The measurement of my inventory should have begun much
earlier had the deﬁnition and interpretation of the right inventory metrics
been made available. The power of the business results achievable by
overcoming functional role bias and by leveraging inventory segmentation
cannot be overstated.

Acknowledgments
A person is fortunate in life to have a mentor who gives them the guidance
and direction to build a solid business foundation. I was fortunate to have
two, Ed Linden and Pat Hourihan. They not only taught me the basics of
supply-chain management but instilled the conﬁdence in me to go forward
with my career. I learned so much from you guys — thank you.
I wish to acknowledge my brother, Mike Aiello, for his insight, support,
and encouragement. Mike, you will recognize many of the charts shown
in this book; thank you, Mike. To my friends and colleagues, John Taggart
and Dave Rumsey, thank you for giving up so many of your lunch hours
to give me guidance and direction in the early stages of writing this book.
To my many APICS friends, from whom I learned so much over the
years: thank you all, especially Jim Clark, Marty Edelman, Howard Forman,
Don Frank, John Hegranes, Jack Symon, Rick Titone, Charlie Vigorita, and
Blair Williams. To Stephanie Imperato, who corrected my grammar, punc-
tuation, and run-on sentences; you made me look good — thank you.
A special thank you to my friend, Joe Shedlawski, 2007 APICS president,
for canceling an APICS class you were scheduled to teach. I ﬁlled in for
Joe and met a student named Pat, who became my wife. Thanks, Joe, for
the teaching opportunity and my wife.
To my son, Michael Aiello, who while in college gave me a blank
bound book with my name on the spine as the author along with a note,
“Here’s that book you’ve been meaning to write.” I’ve kept that note and
blank book all these years. Well, here it is … thanks, kid.
To Bill Walker, friend, author, and my series editor at Taylor & Francis;
simply stated, there would be no book without your support, conﬁdence,
and guidance. You kept me on course for the 15 months it took me to
write this. To say thank you doesn’t seem to be enough.

Rightsizing Inventory
Last, but certainly not least, I wish to thank my wife, Pat, who tolerated
my frustrations and the many long hours and weekends it took to write
this book. Without her patient temperament and support, I couldn’t have
written this book. You’ve had a profound effect, not only on this book
but my life as well.

About This Book
This book is about a mid-sized manufacturing company facing the daunting
task of managing inventory effectively and efﬁciently. Woodstock Lighting
Group is a composite case study from my practitioner and consulting
experience working with many companies in a variety of industries. I
have developed a scenario about facing the day-to-day challenges of
running a business and at the same time dealing with the company culture
and politics. The problems and issues facing Woodstock Lighting Group
will be quite familiar to the reader and are commonplace in many
industries today.
The reader will recognize and hopefully appreciate the problems
Woodstock is facing. Perhaps you have experienced some of the same
issues. This book is divided into 12 chapters with different characters from
the supply chain presenting to a team that is leading the Woodstock
inventory “rightsizing” effort. Each speaker represents a different link in
the supply chain and discusses his or her role and responsibility in
managing inventory. They also speak about their issues and problems and
how they interact with other links in the supply chain.
Each chapter also includes tips on how to rightsize inventory. There
are 150 tips given in this book. Each tip is repeated twice in the same
chapter. The ﬁrst time is when the presenter gives the tip to the team,
called the “Harmony Team.” It is highlighted in the text. The second time
the tip appears is at the end of the chapter where the author explains
how to apply and use the tip in your company.
The objective of each chapter (and this book) is for the reader to gain
an understanding of what each link is responsible for and how each link
in the supply chain manages inventory. The reader will learn how deci-
sions made in one link impact the upstream and downstream decisions

Rightsizing Inventory
of the other links in the supply chain. All major links in the supply chain
are discussed, even the unsung heroes of inventory management: human
resources, maintenance, ﬁeld service, and facilities management.
How This Book Is Organized
Each chapter is presented as one or more meetings of the Harmony Team
and the date of the meeting. This is followed by the ﬁnancial value of
the inventory on the date of the meeting (or the closest month end value).
The presenters then introduce themselves, followed by a “stream of
consciousness” musing about what they are thinking before they go to
the meeting. They then present their case giving examples and formulas
to support their presentation. Periodically during their presentation they
will offer a tip on rightsizing inventory. Almost as if the thought just
popped into their head as they were speaking.
This is followed by an e-mail sent to all supply-chain managers at the
end of each meeting (each chapter), which highlights and summarizes
the key points made in the chapter. Immediately following the e-mail is
an inventory rightsizing model that the Harmony Team adds to at the end
of each chapter. The last activity in the model leads the reader to “go to
the next chapter” to continue building the model. After the latest version
of the inventory “rightsizing” model, the author takes over and in textbook
format discusses how to apply the tips, tools, and philosophies to your
company. This is the “how to” part of this story.
Each chapter ends with the latest “dashboard” of vital company statistics
such as year-to-date actual sales to forecast, production and inventory
position by category, raw materials, work-in-progress, and ﬁnished goods.
By year end the complete model is built.
This format is used for the ﬁrst ten chapters but changes in the last
two. In Chapter 11, Jack, the supply-chain manager, warns the team about
the ten most common mistakes companies make when trying to rightsize
their inventory. He goes on to explain how Woodstock can avoid making
those same mistakes.
Chapter 12 is where the company president presents the ﬁnal inventory
rightsizing model to the Harmony Team, which will be used as a checklist
for the future. The book concludes with Adriana addressing all company
employees using a video conference as the media. At the conference she
discusses the highlights of the year just concluded and plans for the
coming year, and thanks all employees for their contributions to the
inventory rightsizing effort. The following summarizes each chapter:

How to Get the Most 
from This Book
Each chapter is presented by people represent the various links found
in most supply chains. The story line centers on Woodstock Lighting
Group, which has many typical inventory problems found in many
companies. Many companies that are world-class today went through
the trials and pains Woodstock is experiencing. You will ﬁnd many
problems and challenges similar to a typical manufacturing company.
While all this is going on, the employees have to deal with the company
culture and politics. As the story progresses, you will see the ﬂuctuations
in inventory. Some months it goes up and other times it goes down.
Overall the trend is downward and can be attributed to the things learned
by the Harmony Team.
This is a story about a company that managed inventory from a silo
perspective until it fully understood the role it plays in managing inventory.
The discussions, along with the ﬁgures, tables, formulas, and tips will
help the reader understand how a supply chain can work, given the
understanding, knowledge, management support, and tools as discussed
in this book. By the end of this book you and your team will be able to
apply the tips, tools, and technologies to rightsize your own inventory.
You, too, can turn your inventory silos into a collaborative supply-chain
network. Good luck!

Chapter 1
Inventory as a Strategic 
Advantage
January 2, First Work Day of the New Year
Woodstock Inventory: $40 Million
My name is Joe, I’m vice president of operations at Woodstock
Lighting Group.
I couldn’t sleep last night. Today is going to be a bad one. With any luck,
I’ll get ﬁred, go home, and sleep for the rest of the winter. Yeah, right; with
a stiff mortgage, a wife, two little ones, a car payment (soon to be two,
with 175,000 miles on “Jerry,” my car), food, and other bills, getting ﬁred
is the last thing I need in my life right now. I earn a decent living. I’ll just
have to tough it out until something better comes along. Let’s see if I can
get them — before they get me.
In my job, I am responsible for most supply-chain activities. Old tradi-
tions die hard here, and the only thing that changes is the calendar. I have
tried to get them to switch my title to a more contemporary one: vice
president of supply chain or vice president of logistics, but they won’t do
it. To quote my boss, “We have had a vice president of operations position
ever since the company was founded in 1942, and we are not about to
change it now just to make you happy.” So be it. The reason I’ve stayed
here for 15 years is that the salary and beneﬁts are great. I’m 48 years old
now, too old to start over and have to prove myself somewhere else. That
is, if I could ﬁnd a job somewhere else.

Rightsizing Inventory
Woodstock Lighting Group manufactures and distributes three distinctly
different product lines: ﬂashlights, spotlights, and beacon lights. My job
is to buy materials, make the products, and ship the products to customers.
Well, it’s actually much more complicated than that, but let’s keep it simple
for now. Woodstock has lost money and market share for two years in a
row, and unless we turn things around quickly, I may get my wish to
catch up on my sleep. What my job is really about is managing inventory.
I buy inventory, I make inventory, and I ship inventory.
The reason I’m not sleeping well is because I’m worried about inventory:
our inventory, our suppliers’ inventory, and our customers’ inventory. How
much inventory is enough? Just when I think I have the answer, something
happens in my supply chain that causes my inventory to grow or shrink
to undesirable levels, and I have to bring it back into balance again. I
could do it if all the other links in our supply chain cooperated and did
what I said. Most of the people here are only interested in their own
problems and whether or not they are meeting their own performance
measurements for the year. Then they can get a raise, bonus, promotion
— or all three.
Just before I went off on holiday, I received an inter-ofﬁce e-mail from
Adriana, our company president, expressing her displeasure about the
amount of inventory in our supply chain. Here is what she said:
Inter-Ofﬁce E-mail
To: Joe, Vice President, Operations
December 31
From: Adriana, President
Subject: High Inventory
Joe, I just received the results of the physical inventory
we took last week. I am concerned and disappointed.
Inventory is up $5 million from last year’s physical inven-
tory. This is far too high and unacceptable. Based on our
COGS (cost of goods sold) and average inventory
throughout the year, we only turned our inventory 1.7
times. This cannot continue. I expect you and your team
to implement a plan to reduce inventory dramatically
ASAP. I expect a plan of action on my desk by the end
of January. Call me if you have any questions. Adriana
I knew this was coming. Well, it’s a new year, and I’m determined to
change things, or get ﬁred for trying. In December, knowing inventory

was going to be a hot topic this year, I committed a signiﬁcant portion of
my meager budget and hired a supply-chain professional. His name is
Jack, and I’ve given him the title of supply-chain manager. They won’t
change my title, but they can’t stop me from calling my new manager
what I want. Jack comes from a large company recognized as a leader
in supply-chain innovations. Jack is smart, ambitious, experienced, and
has what I believe to be a most outstanding attribute: He is a team player.
Professionally, Jack recently achieved the prestigious CSCP (Certiﬁed Sup-
ply-Chain Professional) certiﬁcation from APICS, The Association for Oper-
ations Management.
Jack has one broad but important task this coming year. I can state it
in one sentence. His job is turning inventory silos into a collaborative
supply-chain network, with the objective of “rightsizing” inventory in each
link of our supply chain. By rightsizing, I mean having the right quantity
inventory at the right location in our supply chain. The reason I said today
is going to be a bad one is that today is my weekly production meeting
with planning, manufacturing, and purchasing to review inventory levels.
It won’t be a pleasant meeting. Today is Jack’s ﬁrst day of work. I invited
him to attend the meeting and instructed him to listen to the dialog and
report back to me after the meeting to discuss his observations. Jack e-
mailed me his report:
Inter-Ofﬁce E-mail
To: Joe, VP Operations
January 2
From: Jack, Supply Chain Manager
Subject: Weekly Production Meeting — Observations
1.
No formal agenda was published and distributed in
advance.
2.
The end time of the meeting was not preset (9:00–??).
3.
The word “I” was used over 100 times (I stopped
counting at 105), mostly by you.
4.
The word “we” was used twice.
5.
The term “production meeting” was too narrow
because you all talked about many topics not related
to production.
6.
The Materials Manager (Cyndie) and the Purchasing
VP (Eddie) talked a lot, mostly defending their posi-
tions relative to the current inventory levels. The plant
manager (Arnie) said very little and seemed anxious
to get the meeting over with.


Rightsizing Inventory
7.
All groups that impact production were not present
at the meeting. I understand that no minutes of the
meeting are published for distribution, not even to
attendees.
8.
Because action items were not clearly deﬁned,
responsibility and accountability was unclear. It
seemed that if someone felt like taking on an action
item, they might do so if they felt inclined.
9.
No goals for the week were discussed and planned for.
10.
No weekly, monthly, or annual performance measure-
ments were set or, worse yet, even discussed.
11.
The meeting was held in your ofﬁce with you sitting
behind a desk and the others in chairs with no place
to put their “stuff” on.
12.
No visual aids were used for all to see.
13.
There were no handouts.
In summary, Joe, the meeting was poorly run and didn’t
accomplish much. Goals need to be set, responsibilities
need to be assigned, and other links in the supply chain
must get involved in these discussions. You cannot have
a collaborative supply-chain network unless all of the
links in the supply chain understand the issues and
concerns of the other links. This can only be done
through communication and interaction between all
the links in the supply chain. This company culture of
operating independently has to change, and change
must start at the very top levels of the company.
Respectfully submitted, Jack
I read Jack’s report, and my ﬁrst reaction was to get mad. Gee, tell me
how you really feel, Jack! However, being a mature adult and remembering
my New Year’s resolution to change things, I calmed down and met with
Jack to discuss how to proceed. We recognized that two signiﬁcant issues
needed to be addressed immediately: inventory levels and supply-chain
communication. Our ﬁrst action was to make a list of all the links in our
supply chain. We came up with the list represented in Table 1.1.
These are the major links in our supply chain. Each of the major links
has many sublinks. We listed some of the inventory-related activities as a
point of reference only; it is not intended to be all inclusive. For example,
quality products and services is an important aspect of our business and

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage


is everyone’s responsibility. The quality group reports to manufacturing
and is not considered a separate link in our supply chain. Jack and I took
our list and met with Adriana, our company president. Adriana has been
president for two years and has been with the company for ﬁfteen years,
most recently as vice president of ﬁnance. Her experience and education
are in ﬁnance and accounting. We explained to her that we wanted to
survey people in each of our internal and external links. Our goal was
to discover the inventory problems they were facing on a daily basis and
what we could do collectively to improve things. We asked her to e-mail
or meet with all the key players and explain what we were doing and
why we were doing it.
We decided that every time someone made a point worth communi-
cating to all our supply-chain links, we would highlight and communicate
it by denoting it as a TEAM IMPORTANT POINT (TIP). For example,
TIP number one is:
TIP #1: Communicate, communicate, communicate …
with everyone.
Adriana said she would tell everyone, stay involved, and help in any
way she could. On a personal level she said she was delighted that I was
taking a leadership position in this effort, and she looked forward to our
working together (like I had a choice after receiving her e-mail).

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #2: Someone in the company must recognize that
change is needed, become the champion, and take a lead-
ership role to make it happen.
TIP #3: Executive management must be committed and
involved for change to take place.
Jack and I conducted our survey in person, one on one. Because we
identiﬁed 19 links in our supply chain, the survey took several weeks.
Our approach was simple. There was no formal document to read or ﬁll
out. When we set up the meetings, we only said we wanted to discuss
how we could help make their job easier in managing inventory levels,
so that their group could operate more efﬁciently. We asked the same
three questions to all 19 people:
1.
What is the single biggest obstacle your group faces in managing
inventory?
2.
What would you do to change things?
3.
How would you go about it?
We just let them talk and listened carefully to what they had to say.
Some people talked for hours (the longest interview took three hours and
the shortest one took 30 minutes). With some, it was like pulling teeth,
and we had to provide examples of things that were thought to be wrong.
In the end, we weren’t surprised by the results. Once we got people
talking, we couldn’t stop them. Boy, did they let us have it — with both
barrels! The list was long, and there was a lot of repetition. We determined
(I’m using the word “we” already) that there was one problem common
to all the links in our supply chain. It was the perceived lack of under-
standing by the other links regarding their role and responsibility in
managing inventory in our supply chain. The second, more tangible,
problem they all faced was managing inventory into and out of their link
in the supply chain.
TIP #4: If you want to learn anything, ask questions —
lots of questions.
Our ﬁndings showed that some links had too much inventory, and
others didn’t have enough. It is interesting that the links with too much
inventory, in general, mentioned having fewer problems than those that
said they didn’t have enough. Gee, what a surprise! The result of this
imbalance was high inventories, stockouts, late customer orders, inefﬁcient
manufacturing, and unhappy suppliers, customers, and employees. Inter-

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

estingly enough, each link blamed the other links for their inventory
problems; it was never their fault. There was a lot of “us” and “them” in
the dialog. This was very interesting. We documented the facts related to
inventory to benchmark our current position. Table 1.2 represents the
baseline numbers from which we would measure our success (or failure)
from this point on.
TIP #5: When starting out on an inventory rightsizing
effort, you must ﬁrst benchmark where you are in terms
of current inventory levels by category and location in the
supply chain.
As you can see, we have $40 million worth of inventory for a company
with $90 million in sales. Our cost of goods sold (COGS) last year was
$60 million. COGS is made up of three elements: material used in our
product (direct material), labor to make the product (direct labor), and
overhead costs associated with making the product.
Here at Woodstock, our overhead calculation includes many of our
salaried operations employees, such as planning, purchasing, engineering,
and plant supervision. The breakdown of COGS is material 55 percent,
labor 15 percent, and overheads, 30 percent. At Woodstock, we deﬁne
direct material as material that goes into our product. On the other hand,
indirect material is used to make our product. For example, in our
Flashlight Division, a direct material would be the springs used in the
base of the ﬂashlight. An indirect material would be the sandpaper used
on our deburring machines to get rid of the rough edges. The sandpaper
would be categorized as an expense item.
Direct labor occurs when someone touches the product and adds value
to the product. Indirect labor occurs when someone touches the product
but doesn’t add value to it. For example, the machine operator on the
injection molding machine would be considered direct labor because he
or she is adding value to the product. On the other hand, the forklift

driver would be considered indirect labor because he or she touches the
product but doesn’t add value to it. This might be considered part of
overhead. Our average inventory last year was about $35 million a month,
with a high of $40 million at the end of the year. Adriana mentioned in
her e-mail that our inventory turns last year were 1.7. Inventory turns is
deﬁned as the number of times inventory cycles out of the company
during the year. Her comment was based on the following data:
Formula for Inventory Turns:
Inventory turns = Cost of goods sold/average inventory
Woodstock inventory turns = $60,000,000/$35,000,000 = 1.7
Although the year-end inventory was $40,000,000, the average through-
out the year was $35,000,000. This is terrible! For a company of our size
to turn inventory less than two times a year is criminal. I happen to know
that our competition is turning its inventory 3.5 times a year. That isn’t
great either, but it is a lot better than what we are doing.
Jack and I met with Adriana to discuss our ﬁndings. We concluded
the following would be the objectives in our inventory rightsizing effort:

The company has to change from a “them versus us” culture to a
“we” culture.

All links in our supply chain need to understand the roles, respon-
sibilities, and the issues of all the other links in our supply chain
in managing inventory efﬁciently.

The focus of this understanding would be to rightsize the inventory
in our entire supply chain; that is, have the right item, in the right
quantity, of the right quality, and at the right time to satisfy all
downstream customer requirements. Not just external customers,
but internal customers as well.

We need to develop quantitative performance metrics that make
sense and are achievable.
The next thing we did was to have Adriana call a meeting (teleconfer-
ence) with all senior managers representing each link in our supply chain
to explain what we were going to do. She told them they would all
participate on an as-needed basis and meet formally once a month to review
the status of this effort. She made it clear that everyone had to cooperate
and participate in this effort, and rightsizing inventory would be a signiﬁcant
part of their shared performance evaluation for the year. Point well made.

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage


TIP #6: Rightsizing inventory is the responsibility of every-
one in the supply chain, and performance metrics should
be shared by all links in the supply chain.
Now that the president’s commitment and involvement had been
communicated to the senior members in our supply chain, we needed
a plan of action. Jack and I didn’t think we should dictate a plan of
action to these managers. If we did, it would be our plan, and buy-
in would become difﬁcult. What we needed was a panel of supply-
chain experts within our company who could take the lead in coor-
dinating this culture change. Because it was not reasonable to have
all 19 supply-chain managers on this panel (nothing would get done),
we sought to ﬁnd 6 employees, in our company of 300 people, who
could best succeed in this. The common characteristics of the employ-
ees we sought were
1.
Well respected by their peers
2.
Excellent communication skills
3.
Broad-based knowledge on how the company currently operated
What we didn’t want:
1.
People with abrasive personalities.
2.
Senior managers, just because they had position, title, or longevity
with the company.
3.
Knowledge experts in one particular supply-chain link. We would
call on the experts later.
We knew we couldn’t make everyone happy. What is that old saying,
“you can please some of the people some of the time, but you can’t …
”? So Adriana, Jack, and I picked the team. Because I was already on the
Steering Committee (Adriana had already made this decision for me), we
thought it best that I not be on the team. Besides, I was still getting used
to the “we” word and had a long way to go. At this point, we decided
to give the team a name. We had to call it something besides “the team.”
We didn’t want something long-winded or a fancy acronym that nobody
would understand. We didn’t want to waste a lot of time trying to be
original or clever. We just wanted to give the team a name that everyone
in the company would recognize. We decided to call it the “Harmony
Team.” By deﬁnition, the word harmony implies a state of agreement in
feeling, action, ideas, and interest. The following people were chosen for
the Harmony Team:

Rightsizing Inventory
Harmony Team facilitator: Arnie, Plant Manager
We thought about making Jack the Harmony Team leader but decided
against it. Jack was too new to the company, and it might be difﬁcult for
him to be accepted by many of the longtime employees. Besides, although
he brought an outside perspective of how successful supply chains func-
tioned, he didn’t know our supply chain that well. We decided that Jack
would be on the Harmony Team but not lead it. We believed Arnie would
be an excellent choice. His position as plant manager put him at the very
heart of our supply chain. Arnie runs our only manufacturing facility. He
has been with the company 25 years and worked his way up through
the ranks. He started out as an order picker in the distribution center and
held many different positions in the company before becoming plant
manager ﬁve years ago. He is well respected in the company and has
kept up with the latest techniques, technologies, and methodologies used
in manufacturing today.
On top of all that, he is on a ﬁrst-name basis with our major suppliers
and some of our major customers. Perfect! Adriana and I met with Arnie
and explained the position to him. We told him we recognized that this
would increase his workload short-term, and he would have to shift much
of his daily work to Orlando to his capable assistant plant manager. We
also indicated that rewards, deliverables, and performance measures would
be forthcoming and would be team-based rather than individual-based.
Arnie accepted the terms and took on the role as Harmony Team leader.
He also got to pick the rest of the team along with Adriana, Jack, and
myself. Here is the rest of the team:
Harmony Team Members:
Eddie: Senior vice president of purchasing, 40 years’ service,
retiring at the end of the year. Well liked and knowledgeable
in how the company operates in all areas of materials manage-
ment (planning and purchasing).
Pat: Director of ﬁnance, ﬁve years’ service, spent eight years
as controller of her family’s wholesale business before it was
sold to a large conglomerate.
Maria: Customer service manager, ten years’ service, ﬁrst job
out of college, eight years as a sales representative before
moving into the customer service position.
Michael: Packaging engineer, two years’ service with Wood-
stock, six years’ experience overall. Came up through our
apprentice program; he spent six months in Product Design,
six months in Cost Accounting, and six months in Process
Design before his latest position as packaging engineer.

11
Jack: Supply-chain manager. You already met Jack; he reports
to me.
TIP #7: Pick a team, establish goals and objectives, bench-
mark where you are, and identify shared performance
measurements. Communicate this to everyone.
All right, it looks like we are ready to start. Did we forget anything?
Oops, we almost forgot two of the most important links in our supply
chain: our suppliers and our external customers. We’ll let the Harmony
Team work with the supply-chain managers to decide who should be
asked to join the team. Where was I? Oh yeah, we are organized, have
set up communications, and selected the Harmony Team. We have top
management commitment and involvement, and we have a goal to right-
size inventory in all our supply-chain links.
What we don’t have is a vision of what the new supply chain will
look like, quantitative goals of where we want to be, or a plan on how
to get there, once we decide! One thing we have plenty of is questions
such as: How can we position inventory so it can be used as a strategic
advantage against our competition? Should we view inventory as an asset
or a liability? What constitutes a “perfect order” from our customers’
perspective? What constitutes a perfect order from our company perspec-
tive? Is the customer always right? Questions, lots of questions — it’s time
we started to get some answers. Only when we understand the answers
to these questions (and others) can we begin to turn inventory silos into
a collaborative supply-chain network.
TIP #8: Delegate authority, accountability, and responsi-
bility to those who can best accomplish the task of right-
sizing inventory in the supply chain.
I called the ﬁrst meeting of the Harmony Team for February 2. After
the meeting, Adriana and I are going on a road trip to visit some of our
key suppliers and customers to ask them what they think about our
relationship with them.

Rightsizing Inventory
February 2, First Meeting of the Harmony Team
Woodstock Inventory: $41 Million
My name is Arnie. I’m plant manager for Woodstock and the Har-
mony Team leader.
Our inventory is out of control. In the past month, inventory has increased
by $1 million. Part of this increase in inventory can be attributed to the
typical “noise level” of inventory ﬂuctuation. We have also identiﬁed that
about $200,000 of the increase is due to incoming raw materials for the
new lantern product line, which has not gone into production yet. In
addition, our actual sales for January were off by $1.4 million, so this also
contributed to the inventory increase. To top it all off, we had asked our
suppliers to hold off shipping to us in December, but few of them did.
We got hit with over $4 million in incoming raw material.
We can’t complete customer orders because of part shortages, and our
warehouses and distribution centers are loaded with “stuff.” It’s gotten so
bad that we will run out of warehouse space by the end of April. Even
as I speak, we have two trailers sitting in the yard that we can’t unload,
and we are paying daily demurrage fees to the trucking company.
Sales is screaming because we are late on a big order for one of our
largest customers. Finance is all over us because inventories are at record
levels. We’ve lost money for two years in a row and, as you know, we
have had a hiring and wage freeze since the ﬁrst of the year. Morale is
the worst I have ever seen it in the 25 years I have been with the
company. Things have to change for the better and change quickly.
Each of our supply-chain links operates in an independent fashion,
working as silos or islands unto themselves. If we are going to survive,
we must become a collaborative network, delivering products and ser-
vices to our customers in a timely fashion and at a proﬁtable level for
our stakeholders.
We no longer compete against other companies; we compete against
other supply chains, as depicted in Figure 1.1. We are only as good as
the weakest link in our chain. Today, we begin to change things.
You have been chosen for the Harmony Team because you possess
three common attributes: you are well respected by your peers, you have
excellent communication skills, and you have a solid understanding of
how our supply chain operates today.
You are not expected to be the knowledge experts in each of our
links. We will call on the knowledge experts as we get into the details
of each link in our supply chain. The objective of the Harmony Team is
to rightsize inventory by turning inventory silos into a collaborative supply-
chain network. This is not “just another project” with a start date and an
end date. This will become a new way of life for our company.

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

13
Please do not use the word “project” when someone asks you what
you are working on. “Project” implies that some day this will end, and
we can all go back to our regular jobs, doing exactly what we did before.
This will never end. The players may change over the years, but we will
create a new culture in our supply chain, one of harmony, unity, and
cooperation: a culture of continuous improvement.
TIP #9: Rightsizing inventory is not “just another project”
with a start date and an end date; it has to become a new
way of life for the company.
You are all aware that our inventory at the end of the year was $40
million. The ﬁrst question we need to ask ourselves is this: Does our
inventory level and its location in our supply chain match our inventory
strategy? We should be positioning inventory to give us a strategic advan-
tage in the marketplace.
Inventory as a Strategic Advantage
It’s important to know why inventory exists in our supply chain. Because
our product lines are sold into three distinctly different markets, we cannot
have a “one size ﬁts all” inventory strategy. Table 1.3 shows our annual
Figure 1.1

sales, broken down by division: 67 percent, Flashlight Division; 22 percent,
Spotlight Division; and 11 percent, Beacon Lights. Our strategy for this
year is to increase our share of the ﬂashlight market by 10 percent and
increase our share of the spotlight market by 15 percent annually. The
beacon light business is a small portion of our total revenue, but it is very
proﬁtable. We forecast that sales will remain ﬂat this year, with the
exception of Field Service sales, where we forecast a revenue increase of
$1 million, going from $10 million to $11 million. At some point we may
spin it off because it is not considered a growth market for us (although
it is a signiﬁcant part of our core competency).
Make-to-Stock Inventory Strategy
Our Flashlight Division manufactures and distributes ﬂashlights to com-
mercial customers and distributors who sell to retail stores, from the large
chains to independent hardware stores. Although making inventory that
doesn’t go out the door immediately goes against the principle of contin-
uous inventory ﬂow, the reality is that for now it is a necessity. We use
a make-to-stock inventory strategy for this product line. A make-to-stock
strategy is one where you manufacture to forecast and sell from the
resulting ﬁnished goods inventory.
Put yourselves in the consumer’s shoes. If you wanted to buy a
ﬂashlight to keep in your bedside table for emergencies, you would expect
to go to a store, select one off the J-hook, pay for it, and be on your
way home without a problem. However, consider this scenario: There are
two different J-hooks on the wall in the store, each labeled with a different
manufacturer’s ﬂashlight, and they are the same price and have the same
features. One manufacturer’s J-hook (Manufacturer A) is empty, and the
other one (Manufacturer B) is full. What would you do? Would you go
to the customer service counter and place an order for one ﬂashlight from
Manufacturer A and wait for the store to call you a week later to tell you
that it had arrived? Of course not. All things being equal, you would take
your hand and move it to the J-hook that was full (Manufacturer B), pull

one off, and be on your way. Unless you were looking for some unique
characteristic, the ﬂashlight would be considered a commodity and you
would expect it to be in inventory.
As Figure 1.2 shows, our lead time to manufacture and assemble a
batch (product number 32750) of ﬂashlights is ﬁve days (allowing for
queue, setup, run, wait, and move time). Allowing two days to get it to
our distributors and another two days for them to get it to their customers,
we have a total lead time of nine days, door to door. No consumer wants
to wait nine days to buy a ﬂashlight when they need it now and it is
available in many retail stores.
Because our total lead time is greater than the customer (consumer)
lead time, we have to manufacture in advance of need and put the product
in inventory. This strategy is called make-to-stock. How much to have in
stock is a difﬁcult question that our Sales link and our Demand Planning
link struggle with all the time. Don’t forget, we include batteries along
with the ﬂashlight, and the batteries have a shelf life to be considered. It
wouldn’t do for someone to buy a ﬂashlight with dead batteries. Because
of these issues, we decided to keep manufacturing the ﬂashlight in-house,
rather than go off shore. As 80 percent of our market is domestic, we
wanted to keep control of the manufacturing and distribution.
Because we own and control the manufacturing and distribution of
our products, we operate what is known as a vertical supply chain. If we
outsourced any of the manufacturing or distribution, we would have a
horizontal supply chain. One of the primary beneﬁts of a vertical supply
chain is that we have a high degree of control over our network. Once
we decide to outsource manufacturing or distribution (horizontal supply
chain), we will lose some degree of control. However, Sales tells us we
might have to consider moving manufacturing off shore if we can’t get
our costs under control. Marketing, which sets our sales price, tells us
pricing is becoming more of an issue every day. So our Flashlight Division
faces its own set of inventory problems.
In an ideal world, we would not stock any ﬁnished goods but would
manufacture to customer order. Wouldn’t it be great if we could satisfy

every customer order without carrying any ﬁnished goods in stock? Imag-
ine production going right into cartons, moving to the shipping dock, and
shipping directly to the customer, all in the same day! Wow! With a make-
to-stock inventory strategy, the delivery lead time to the customer is very
short. With this approach, the inventory must be positioned in our supply
chain at a physical location close to the customer (at our distribution
centers) or our distribution and transportation links must be able to deliver
our ﬂashlights directly from our manufacturing plant in New Jersey to our
customers throughout the world. Ideally, we hope to improve our trans-
portation response time to the point where we can eliminate the need
for our three distribution centers, presently located in California, Texas,
and Chicago.
Assemble-to-Order Inventory Strategy
Our Spotlight Division has a different inventory strategy. This is called
assemble-to-order. We stock subassemblies of different size spotlights for
the “special event” marketplace, the emergency vehicle marketplace, and
the commercial and home marketplace. Subassemblies are partially man-
ufactured products placed in inventory and assembled into the ﬁnal
conﬁguration after receipt of the customer order. Typically, assemble-to-
order products have many options to suit different customer requirements.
For example, if a municipality wants a certain conﬁguration of lights for
its emergency vehicles, we will take the subassemblies out of stock and
assemble the ﬁnal product to their speciﬁcations. One municipality may
require a four-color string of lights in a light bar and another municipality
may require a ﬁve-color light bar. In this environment, we keep the
standard component subassemblies in inventory and assemble the ﬁnal
product after receipt of the customer order.
Subassemblies are more costly to keep in inventory because not
only did we pay for the raw material, but we also partially assembled
the product, thus, adding value to it. We also have to pay for the labor
long before we ship the order and bill the customer. The trade-off here
is that we have more ﬂexibility to respond to customer’s unique needs
in a timely fashion, and cash outﬂow will be greater. Overall, the
delivery lead time to the customer with an assemble-to-order inventory
strategy is longer than the delivery lead time in a make-to-stock strategy,
because we have to add in the ﬁnal assembly lead time, as shown in
Figure 1.2.
Our supply-chain strategy is to deliver these orders directly to our
customers, bypassing the distribution center, unless we are consolidating
the order with other orders presently going to that customer. We do,
however, keep a limited amount of standard assembled products at our

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

three distribution centers for immediate delivery to our customers. Where
the make-to-stock strategy is driven by forecasted demand, the assemble-
to-order strategy is driven by actual customer orders. The subassemblies
are driven by forecasted demand, and the ﬁnal assembly is driven by the
actual customer order.
Manufacture-to-Order and Engineer-to-Order Strategies
Our Beacon Light Division sells beacon lights that are used in lighthouses
around the world. Today, this is mostly a replacement market with little
growth. We call our strategy here a manufacture-to-order strategy or, in
some rare cases, an engineer-to-order strategy, where we will actually
design the light conﬁguration for the customer. In the manufacture-to-
order strategy, we keep very little inventory, limited to only the raw
materials that are common to most beacon lights. This inventory is driven
by a forecast. Only after receipt of the customer order do we go out and
buy the unique raw materials needed. In the case of engineer-to-order,
we don’t stock inventory of any kind. We only buy inventory after the
customer has approved the new design.
This division has one unique aspect of inventory management that the
other two divisions don’t face. It has a service department that goes into
the ﬁeld to repair beacon lights that malfunction. The ﬁeld service group
requires a certain amount of inventory be available on an emergency
basis, because beacon lights must be functional at all times. We use a
make-to-stock strategy for these replacement parts. This inventory is driven
by a forecast, based on historical demand. The manufacture-to-order and
engineer-to-order strategies require the longest delivery lead time. This is
because, going in, we have no idea of what we are going to make and
have to add the design element to the total lead time.
Because of this, we can say that the Beacon Light Division uses all
four inventory strategies: make-to-stock, assemble-to-order, manufacture-
to-order, and engineer-to-order. The supply-chain strategy for this product
line is to ship the subassemblies directly to the customer site from our
manufacturing facility in New Jersey. We then send a team of engineers
to the customer site for ﬁnal assembly and test. In the case of spare parts,
we have third-party logistics providers who, for a fee, stock spare parts
at strategic East and West Coast locations (close to airports) of the United
States. Spare parts can be ﬂown as needed anywhere in the world on a
moment’s notice. We also keep a limited amount of inventory at our own
distribution centers and will ship direct to the customer or to our third-
party logistics provider.
So there you have it. Each division has a different strategy when it
comes to managing inventory. The total delivery lead time is getting shorter

18

Rightsizing Inventory
and shorter as product life cycles continue to contract and customer’s
expectations increase.
As you are all aware, we took a physical inventory during our year-
end shutdown. We were quite surprised to ﬁnd that our book inventory
was much lower than the actual physical inventory. This tells us our
inventory record keeping throughout the year was grossly inaccurate. We
will have to address this issue as soon as possible. The physical inventory
gives us a good starting point, but unless we ﬁnd and ﬁx the reasons for
inaccuracies, it will quickly become inaccurate again. However, our focus
today is on matching our inventory position with our inventory strategy.
Referring back to Table 1.2, please note that raw material includes sub-
assemblies, and ﬁnished goods include spare parts for the Beacon Light
Division. The numbers shown represent a good amount of data on the
makeup of our inventory and where it resides in our supply chain.
Now, we have to turn this data into meaningful information. Does our
inventory strategy match our inventory levels by location in the supply
chain? Table 1.4 shows where our inventory resides in our supply chain.
Does our inventory strategy for each division match our types of inventory
(raw material, work-in-progress [WIP], ﬁnished goods)? Let’s look at our
ﬂashlight make-to-stock strategy.
Table 1.2 and Table 1.4 show that 84 percent of our total ﬁnished
goods inventory is for ﬂashlights. Although the inventory is too high, it
does match our strategy. But, as Figure 1.3 shows, only 46 percent of
the ﬂashlight inventory is in ﬁnished goods; it does not match our strategy.
This also points out that the other 54 percent of the ﬂashlight inventory
is in raw materials and WIP. Because we can’t do much about the ﬁnished
goods, except to let sales know it needs to address it, we can focus on
rightsizing the raw materials and WIP inventory for this division, which
is too high and out of balance with our overall inventory strategy for
this division.
Now, let’s look at another strategy and inventory comparison. If you
look at Table 1.4 for beacon lights, make-to-order strategy, you will note
that 13 percent of all ﬁnished goods inventory is for this division, which

seems to match the corporate inventory strategy. However, if you look at
Figure 1.4, the beacon light inventory by itself, 50 percent of all beacon
light inventory is in ﬁnished goods.
This does not match our inventory strategy. We should have a higher
percentage of raw materials (spare parts) and a lower percentage of
ﬁnished goods. Based on this information, we should attack the ﬁnished
goods inventory ﬁrst. In theory, we shouldn’t have any ﬁnished goods
for this division.
In the case of the Spotlight Division, Figure 1.5 shows that 75 percent
of its inventory is in raw materials, and its inventory represents 35 percent

(Table 1.2) of all raw material inventories. This number is too high and
does not match its inventory strategy.
Although the ﬁnished goods for this division are only 3 percent of
all ﬁnished goods, it does represent 6 percent of all spotlight inventory,
where the strategy calls for no ﬁnished goods inventory. So there you
have it, our inventory levels by category do not match our inventory
strategies by division.
TIP #10: Start rightsizing your inventory by aligning your
inventory levels to match your inventory strategies by
product or division classiﬁcations.
Here is what we need to focus on to realign our physical inventories
to our inventory strategies:
Flashlight Division: Focus on reducing the ratios of raw materials
and WIP to ﬁnished goods.
Beacon Light Division: Focus on reducing the ratios of ﬁnished
goods inventory to raw material and WIP.
Spotlight Division: Focus on reducing the ratios of ﬁnished goods
to raw material and WIP.
It is important to note that these actions won’t necessarily reduce
inventory levels but will shift location of our inventory levels in our supply

chain so that they match our corporate strategies. Once we have done
that, we can focus on reducing the levels of inventory in the supply chain.
TIP #11: Gather inventory data by type, location, and
business segment. Compare it to the corporate inventory
strategy. Any inconsistency in inventory and strategy must
be addressed and corrected.
Unfortunately, not all of our supply-chain links under-
stand the fundamental inventory strategies I’ve just
cited. We need to educate everyone in our supply chain
on the importance of aligning physical inventory to our
corporate strategy.
Inventory: Asset or Liability?
That depends on who you talk to here at Woodstock. I’m not a ﬁnancial
guy, but no one here at Woodstock will argue the fact that in many
real and tangible ways inventory is deﬁnitely an asset. Inventory enters
our supply chain as an asset and, for accounting purposes, is recorded
as an asset on our balance sheet. The balance sheet is a ﬁnancial
document where, on a periodic basis, we record what the company
owns (assets) and what the company owes (liabilities). Table 1.5 is an
example of a simpliﬁed balance sheet. Inventory is recorded as an asset
on the balance sheet.
Hopefully, our assets far outweigh our liabilities. The difference
between assets and liabilities is called owner equity. Put another way, if

Rightsizing Inventory
your house is valued at $350,000 (asset) and you still owe $200,000
(liability) on the mortgage, your owner’s equity is $150,000. Inventory
remains on the balance sheet until it is shipped. At that point, it becomes
part of COGS and moves to another ﬁnancial document called the income
statement, as shown in Table 1.6.
COGS is made up of three primary elements: material, labor, and
overhead. Of course, I’m oversimplifying it, but you get the idea.
Now wait a minute, don’t get excited and start yelling. I’ll say it. “If
the inventory is old, damaged, obsolete, discontinued, engineered out,
has an expired shelf life, or is simply not needed, it becomes a liability.
Feel better? As a rule of thumb, any inventory not needed to satisfy an
immediate customer need can be considered a liability, with exceptions
of course. This is an underlying principle of inventory management. It
is a philosophy practiced by those who follow the concepts of just-in-
time and lean manufacturing. The goal is zero excess inventories. No
one ever gets to the end of that rainbow, but it is an ideal we strive
to obtain.
Let me state the obvious: Inventory costs money. We have to pay for
the materials, pay for the labor to transform the materials, and pay to
store and ship the ﬁnished product. In a lot of cases we borrow money
to buy the inventory, so we also have to pay interest charges on top of
the amount borrowed.
TIP #12: Inventory is considered an asset on the com-
pany balance sheet. Inventory is a liability if you have
more than you need to satisfy immediate customer
requirements.
As you may be aware, I’ve known some of our customers for years.
Every once in a while they visit with us, and I take them on a plant
tour to show them the latest additions to our manufacturing operation.
As we are walking around, I always ask them the same question: What

do you consider the perfect order? Let me share with you what they
have said. I’ll also share with you our internal sales and marketing view
of the perfect order. This is an interesting point: If you ask ten customers
to describe the perfect order, you will get ten different answers. However,
many of the answers are common to all our customers. Here is how
they see it:
The Perfect Order: Customer Expectations
1.
Shipped on time: Their requested date; not the date we committed
to ship, if different from the requested date.
2.
Received on time: The date requested to arrive at their dock, not
the shipment date, if different.
3.
Shipped and received complete: All items ordered were shipped
in the same shipment and arrived together.
4.
Perfect quality: No defective parts in the shipment.
5.
Correct quantity: No more or no less than was ordered.
6.
Requested carrier used: Mode speciﬁed by the customer.
7.
Accurate documents: All documents, including packing list, way-
bill, manifests, customs papers and advance shipping notices are
in order.
8.
Shipment tracking mechanism in place: Ability to easily track
the shipment location while in transit.
9.
Packaged according to speciﬁcations: Packing requirements
were followed.
10.
Not damaged in transit: The containers arrive in good condition.
11.
Correct invoice: There are no mistakes in the invoice, and it
arrives after the shipment in a timely, efﬁcient manner, electroni-
cally if reasonable.
12.
Clearly deﬁned reverse logistics policy: Clearly deﬁned instruc-
tions on what to do in the event that goods need to be repaired
or returned.
Of course, it goes without saying that all customers want the lowest
possible total cost. By total cost, I mean the cost of the item and all
associated costs, such as transportation and handling. Our ﬂashlights
may have the lowest item cost to the customer, but if the transportation
cost is too high, our total cost to the customer may be higher than
our competition. Obviously, this is unacceptable. We need to analyze
this further to ﬁnd out if our total cost is higher than our competitor’s
total cost.

The Perfect Order: Woodstock Expectations
1.
Satisfy the customer’s 12-point deﬁnition of the perfect
order: Do as they request.
2.
Customer order is easy to process: Ideally, we receive the order
electronically, and all required information is on the order or in
our system.
3.
Customer order is proﬁtable: We can make and ship the product
so that Woodstock makes money on the order.
4.
Customer pays on time: They pay us on or before the invoice
due date.
5.
No returns: Customer keeps the entire shipment.
TIP #13: The perfect order must be considered from both
the viewpoints of the seller and the buyer. The perfect
order criteria must be measurable so that deviations can
be corrected.
The beauty of both lists is that all of the points are measurable. We
can monitor how well or how poorly we are conforming to the “perfect
order” criteria. Also interesting is the fact that every single one of these
metrics relates to inventory, either directly or indirectly. Unfortunately, we
haven’t communicated this list to all the links in our supply chain. If you
ask people in the 19 links to describe the perfect order, you will be
surprised how many people couldn’t name them all. This list should be
documented and published to every link in our supply chain, and a
monthly report should be distributed that measures our performance in
each of these areas. The document should include a benchmark of where
we are today and what our goal is for the rest of the year. At the same
time, we should poll our customers to see how they view our performance
in delivering the perfect order. Joe and Adriana are on the road right now
meeting with customers and some of our key suppliers. I will be anxious
to hear what they have learned. Now let’s move on to another area we
need to understand better.
Silos Versus Cross-Functional Supply Chains
A supply chain can be deﬁned as a series of linked processes, often called
a network, which delivers products or services to customers. A supply-
chain network consists of information, product, services, processes, and
cash that ﬂow into and out of a supply chain. This ﬂow is multidirectional,
going both downstream and upstream. Here at Woodstock, our supply

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

chain delivers both products and services. Put another way, we deliver
inventory to our customers. We have problems doing this. The inventory
problems we face at Woodstock are not new or unique to us. They are
inherent supply-chain problems that go as far back in history to the
invention of ﬁre by the cave people. After all, once they discovered how
to create a ﬁre, they then needed a steady supply of wood (raw material)
to keep their ﬁre going.
Let me provide you with a simple example of a supply chain. I met
a retired man recently who makes holiday decorations out of clothespins.
He buys his raw materials such as paints, fabrics, and novelties at craft
stores, manufactures the product in his home and sells them at craft fairs.
This is a very simple supply chain, but a supply chain nonetheless.
On the other hand we have Henry Ford, who introduced us to mass
production and the assembly line. Ford created a supply chain that grew
to thousands of people located in multiple locations throughout the world.
Ford achieved true vertical supply chain integration with the River Rouge
complex in Detroit. So you see, supply-chains have indeed been around
for a long time and can be very simple or quite complex. The point I’m
trying to make is that supply chains are not a new concept and neither
are the problems they face. The problems that Ford faced were the same
we face today. These problems are

Customer order delivery dates change: dates move up and dates
move out.

Customer order quantities change: Sometimes customers increase
the order quantity and sometimes they decrease the quantity;
sometimes they even cancel the order completely.

Long lead times from our suppliers.

Short lead times from our customers.

Material shortages that disrupt manufacturing and distribution.

Labor and machine capacities change.

Price changes impact our costs.
TIP #14: Successful supply chains have one characteristic
in common; their ability to rapidly respond to change
throughout their entire supply chain, not just one or two
links in the chain.
As you can see, one of the biggest problems supply chains face on a
daily — no, make that hourly — basis is dealing with change. World-class
companies have supply chains that can respond rapidly to change. If you
can’t respond in a timely manner and your competitor supply chains can
— well, goodbye, you won’t be around very long. For the most part,

26

Rightsizing Inventory
managing a supply chain means managing inventory. Even a company
recognized as a world-class manufacturer will fail if other links in its
supply chain are weak. In its simplest form, a supply chain has three
major links, as illustrated in Figure 1.6
On the left, we have suppliers who provide materials and services to
a core company that adds value to the product or service and delivers it
to a customer, as shown on the far right. The core company doesn’t have
to be a manufacturer. It can be a distributor who buys from a manufac-
turing company. In this case, the manufacturer is a supplier. The customer
shown on the far right may not be a consumer (retail customer). The
customer can be another distributor or manufacturer. This diagram would
become more complex if we added more circles, as shown in Figure 1.7.
I want to point out that one core company can have multiple conﬁgurations
to depict its supply chain. For example, for some products the manufac-
turer is the core company itself. For other products the core company is
just the distributor. You will see many variations of this conﬁguration in
various publications.

Let’s go back to Figure 1.6 for a moment: the three-circle conﬁguration.
Each one of these circles is made up of different business functions,
processes, and activities performed by different people working in differ-
ent departments. For example, all ﬁnancial matters concerning the core
company might reside in one department called the Finance Department.
Depending on the size of the company, it might be one person (who
also does work for another department), or it could be a whole slew of
people, totaling in the hundreds.
Their responsibilities might include payroll, accounts payable, accounts
receivable, general ledger, cost accounting, asset management, and the
like. It would not include selling the product (Sales Department), making
the product (Manufacturing), or shipping the product (Distribution). How-
ever, if the company is a one-person company like my clothespin guy, it
could include all these functions. Each one of these departments is headed
up by a manager who reports to a higher level manager. This organization
can become very complex and very deep, depending on the size of the
company. I have brought along a copy of our Woodstock organization
chart for everyone (See Figure 1.8).
You will note that each department manager has a number of people
reporting to him or her. In all, this chart represents the 300 employees
of Woodstock. The popular term used today when referring to these
departments is to call them silos. When you think of a grain silo, you
picture grain ﬂowing into the top of the silo. When needed, it ﬂows out
of the bottom or the top. It is not connected to other silos on the farm.
Another popular term for this concept is islands. When you think of an
island, you think of a piece of land surrounded by water on four sides
and not connected to other islands. Figure 1.9 depicts the silo concept.
A poorly run supply chain is depicted by departments operating as
silos or islands. These function as “entities unto themselves” and are not
involved with what is happening on the other silos. Picture this scenario:
A customer calls a sales representative to complain about receiving poor
quality inventory. The sales representative goes up his or her silo and
tells the local branch sales manager. This sales manager goes up the silo
to the regional sales manager, who in turn tells the regional vice president
of sales about the problem. Finally, the problem is reported to the
corporate vice president of sales, residing in an ofﬁce on the other side
of the country, which is at the top of the Sales Department silo. The
corporate vice president of sales tells the vice president of manufacturing
(another silo) that they received a customer complaint. The vice president
of manufacturing goes down the silo one level and tells the vice president
of operations who in turn tells the plant manager. The plant manager
then tells the ﬂoor supervisor, who eventually tells the worker who made
the product. This worker is at the bottom of the Manufacturing silo. So

what we have is information ﬂowing up one silo and eventually ﬂowing
down another silo. As you can see, if this happened in the real world it
would take forever to respond to the customer’s problem. The problem
with information ﬂowing up and down silos is that response time is poor
and information might be misunderstood or miscommunicated. Obvi-
ously, it would have to be a very poorly run supply chain if this example
were real.
The whole point of this is to show that supply chains cannot operate
this way. They must become integrated and work as cross-functional
work teams to respond to all the changes that take place in the entire
supply chain. No single silo can do it all. When referring to these silos,
I will now use the term supply-chain link. As I said earlier, each link
performs a series of processes. Each link receives input from other links
in our chain, and each link provides output to other links in the chain.
This input/output can be information, cash, products, or a service. The
input/output can ﬂow both upstream (back through the supply chain
to the supplier) or downstream (forward through the supply chain to
the customer).
TIP #15: A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest
link; being world class in one link does you little good if
your other links are weak.
If you were to ask me how well our supply chain works today, I
couldn’t tell you. Oh, sure, each of our links has performance measures,
and based on the individual link’s performance measures, some are doing
well and some are not doing so well. For example, we heard Arnie
describe the perfect order. Of the 12 items listed for the perfect order,

we currently measure only 2 of them: on-time delivery and product quality.
The on-time delivery metric is used to track performance in our manu-
facturing and distribution links. The quality metric is used to track per-
formance in our manufacturing link, because quality assurance reports
into the manufacturing link.
But if we deliver a perfect quality product on time, have we shipped
the perfect order? The truth is, we don’t know. Today, world-class supply
chains use key performance indicators (KPI) that measure how well the
entire supply chain is doing. These KPIs are shared by all links in the
chain and are closely tied to the companies’ strategic plan. For example,
the Supply Chain Council (SCC), a nonproﬁt organization that is open to
all interested nonproﬁt and for-proﬁt organizations, government and mil-
itary agencies, consultants, and academicians has compiled a Supply Chain
Operations Reference (SCOR) model that measures the perfect order as
a KPI. SCOR® is a registered trademark of the Supply Chain Council, Inc.
The formula is simple
Perfect order fulﬁllment =
Total perfect orders/Total number of orders
Well, if we applied that formula to the 12 perfect order (customer)
attributes I spoke of earlier, our KPI is pathetic. In December of last year,
we shipped 2500 customer orders; and Customer Service informed me
that it had received 140 complaints from customers who were not happy
with their shipments for one reason or another. Using the formula, our
KPI would be
2360/2500 = 94 percent
I’m not even sure the complaints were related to the perfect order criteria
I cited earlier. Customer Service doesn’t keep track of the reason for the
complaint. By the way, that has to change also. The point is, even if I
didn’t apply the formula accurately, you will agree that 94 percent cus-
tomer satisfaction is not a good thing. This has to change.
TIP #16: Deﬁne the perfect order criteria and measure
them. Communicate this to everyone in the supply chain.
Based on the published agenda, I’ve used up all my time. It is clear
to me that we have a long journey ahead. As a result of today’s meeting,
and for all future Harmony Team meetings, I suggest we do ﬁve things:
1.
Communicate what we have learned to all supply-chain managers.
2.
Publish a “to-do” list of tasks to be accomplished.

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

31
3.
Publish a weekly report on inventory levels.
4.
Construct an analytical model of how we will maintain the “right-
size” inventory in the future.
5.
Use the minutes to document the details of how the TIPS, tools,
and operating philosophies were applied and the impact they had
on inventory.
Inter-Ofﬁce E-Mail
To: Supply Chain Managers
February 2
From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory Level: $41 Million; up $1 Million since
the 1st of the year
This e-mail is a summary of the discussions we had at
our ﬁrst two meetings. As you all are aware, we have
embarked on an effort to rightsize our inventory
throughout our entire supply chain. We have had our
ﬁrst Harmony Team meeting today and would like to
keep you informed on our progress and planned activ-
ities. Under a separate e-mail, you will receive detailed
minutes of the meeting. We ask that you communicate
with your team members and keep them informed on
the progress of the effort. This e-mail will summarize
some of the key points discussed. Please see the min-
utes for details of the points highlighted here:
1.
Our inventory level and location is not aligned to our
inventory strategy.
2.
Our perpetual inventory records are not accurate.
3.
We need to agree on criteria for deﬁning the perfect
order from both the customer and Woodstock points
of view.
4.
We have adopted a philosophy that any inventory not
needed to satisfy an immediate customer need
should be considered a liability and reduced to a
practical level.
5.
We must change from a silo operating philosophy to
a collaborative, cross-functional operating philosophy.

32

Rightsizing Inventory
6.
As we learn how to rightsize our inventory, we will
construct an analytical inventory model to be used as
a foundation for maintaining the rightsize inventory
in the future.
7.
After each meeting, we will publish a list of tasks to
be accomplished.
8.
Each of you is scheduled to meet with the Harmony
Team in the near future. We ask that you come pre-
pared to discuss your role and responsibilities related
to managing inventory, the tools you currently use,
and the tools that you would like to use in the future
to help you manage inventory more efﬁciently.
Attached to this e-mail are the ﬁrst building blocks for
our inventory rightsizing model (Figure 1.10). The
entire inventory planning process starts with the Busi-
ness Plan.
The Business Plan is a high-level management docu-
ment that drives the entire company. Typically, it is very
ﬁnancially oriented and includes such things as sales
growth, marketplace positioning, capital expenditures,
and general business positioning. An important part of
the Business Plan deals with strategy. This is where man-
agement talks about “reducing inventory by 20 percent
over the next two years” or “increasing inventory by 15
percent over the next 18 months.” It identiﬁes supply-
chain strategies and inventory positioning in the supply
chain, as we have discussed at this meeting.
So let’s begin building our model by showing (Figure
1.10) that the Business Plan drives our entire inventory
strategy, recognizing the fact that the customer inven-
tory strategy is a major input to our inventory strategy.
We will continue to add to this model after each meet-
ing until we have a framework for rightsizing our inven-
tory. The customer input to our inventory strategy will
be discussed at our next meeting.

Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
This chapter sets the foundation for rightsizing inventory. It is the ﬁrst
building block on your road to positioning your inventory correctly in
the entire supply chain. I have suggested 16 TIPS in this chapter related
to rightsizing inventory. Let’s now discuss each TIP and how you can
apply it to your company.
TIP #1: Communicate, communicate, communicate …
with everyone.
Arguably, the single biggest challenge you will face in turning your
functional supply-chain silos into a collaborative supply-chain network
can be summed up in one word, “communication.” As a consultant, one
of the ﬁrst questions I ask a client (typically, the president) is, “What is
your single biggest business issue that needs to be addressed?” More often
than not, I get answers such as long lead times for materials, short lead
times from customers, stock outs, and too much inventory. But if I ask
the same question to people on the plant or warehouse ﬂoor, I get a
different answer: poor communication. Because this is not a book about
communication in general, I will keep it simple and to the point. I believe
Joe, Jack, and Adriana took the right approach in addressing this issue.
Here is a checklist of some things you can do to improve the communi-
cation issue:
1.
Start at the top of the supply chain and communicate with everyone
from the boardroom to the shipping dock.
2.
When appropriate, use e-mail.
3.
Where e-mail is not available, send out memos or post to bulletin
boards.

4.
Communicate in the appropriate language. One company I worked
with translated a memo into Spanish and Polish (the predominate
languages of employees in the plant).
5.
Include notices in paycheck envelopes.
6.
Communicate through the company newsletter.
7.
Have the initial announcement come from the highest level exec-
utive in the company.
8.
When reasonable, communicate face to face.
Using Woodstock as an example, Joe and Jack met face to face with
Adriana and explained the issues and a plan of action. Adriana then sent
an e-mail out to all supply-chain managers letting them know what was
going on and why we were doing it. Jack and Joe then met face to face
with all supply-chain managers to get their input. At the end of the
meeting, the Harmony Team sent out an e-mail keeping everyone informed
about the inventory rightsizing effort. All supply-chain managers were also
asked to inform their employees. The following is an example of an initial
announcement memo:
To: All Employees
From: Adriana, President
Subject: Rightsizing Our Inventory
The past two years have been difﬁcult for all of us at
Woodstock. However, we are working hard on many
fronts to change this, and I am excited and optimistic
that it will happen. One of the areas we are addressing
is managing our inventory better.
I am pleased to announce that we have formed a cross-
functional team of employees to focus on this issue.
This team is lead by Arnie, our Plant Manager. The char-
ter of the team is to rightsize our inventory. Our goal
is to
1.
Reduce inventory levels
2.
Realign inventory in our supply chain
3.
Increase inventory throughput in our supply chain
The team cannot accomplish these goals without your
help and input. Many of you will be contacted directly
for your ideas and suggestions. Because it’s not practical

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

35
for the team to meet with all 300 employees, I ask that
all of you communicate any suggestions you have to any
member of Arnie’s team. The names of the team mem-
bers will be announced shortly. All ideas are welcome
and will be considered. Working together as a team, we
can make this happen. Thank you for your help.
TIP #2: Someone in the company must become the cham-
pion, recognize that change is needed, and take a leader-
ship role in making it happen.
A champion is someone in the company who is passionate in his or
her belief that rightsizing inventory is a good thing for the company and
believes it can happen. In the case of Woodstock, Joe isn’t the champion.
He is a reluctant participant, at best. I would say that for now, Adriana
is the champion of this effort. She’s the one who took action and believes
it can happen. I would have preferred it be someone in a lower position
who would be visible every day. As time goes on, you will learn that
Arnie has become the true champion of the effort. He is the perfect
candidate. Why is having a champion so important? Before I answer that
question, let me provide you with a checklist of champion qualiﬁcations:
1.
Well respected by employees throughout the supply chain
2.
Has excellent (verbal and written) communication skills
3.
Knowledgeable in how your supply chain currently operates
4.
Knowledgeable in state-of-the-art supply-chain techniques and
technologies
5.
Outgoing and personable
6.
Good management skills
7.
Believes in the effort
8.
Has reasonable expectations (obtainable goals)
9.
Has been with the company for a period of time (at least two years)
10.
Enthusiastic and optimistic
I have just described the traits of most successful leaders. Now I can
answer the earlier question. People look up to such a person and will
follow his or her lead. It is contagious, and they get caught up in the
champion’s enthusiasm. They say to themselves, “if Arnie believes we can
do it, then maybe I can help make it happen.” There is the old saying,
“There are those who lead and those that follow; all others get out of the

36

Rightsizing Inventory
way.” Having a champion is important. Initially, you might think that Jack
would be a good candidate because he brings an outside perspective. In
truth, he lacks three of the ten criteria. He doesn’t pass the test of numbers
1, 3, and 9 for obvious reasons.
TIP #3: Executive management must be committed and
involved for change to take place.
Your inventory rightsizing efforts will be less than successful without
the support of your highest level management. This doesn’t just mean
that they send out the initial notice announcing the effort and then walk
away. By commitment and involvement I mean:
1.
Participation at various team meetings
2.
Open door policy
3.
Periodically communicating status to all employees
4.
Ensuring cooperation from all links in the chain
5.
Keeping the stakeholders informed
6.
Helping the team cut through corporate red tape
7.
Demonstrating support on a continual basis
8.
Removing politics from the equation
TIP #4: If you want to learn anything, ask questions …
lots of questions.
Do not be afraid to ask questions. The only stupid question is the one
that goes unasked. One of the reasons we put people on the team who
don’t know an operation that well is because they aren’t embarrassed to
ask questions. They aren’t expected to know all the answers. The checklist
here is shorter but just as potent:
1.
Challenge everything.
2.
Don’t take anything for granted.
3.
Continue to ask questions until you are satisﬁed with the answer.
4.
Ask why, as many times as necessary.
5.
Move on to another question when you are satisﬁed with the
answer.
6.
Go back to step one, and repeat the process.
TIP #5: When starting out on an inventory rightsizing
effort, you must ﬁrst benchmark where you are in terms
of current inventory levels by category and location in the
supply chain.

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

37
This is an important part of the inventory rightsizing effort. If you don’t
know where you are today, how will you know if you are successful or
not? One of the things that Woodstock did right at the beginning was that
it provided details of its inventory levels by division, type, and location,
as shown in Table 1.1, Table 1.2, and Table 1.3. Here is a checklist to
follow:
1.
If you cycle count and have an inventory accuracy of 98 percent
or higher, you can start with the book inventory.
2.
If number 1 is broken down by division, type (raw material, WIP,
and ﬁnished goods), and location (manufacturing warehouse, dis-
tribution center, and product design) in the supply chain, you can
start with the book inventory.
3.
If you don’t meet the criteria for numbers 1 and 2, you should
take a physical inventory.
4.
If you don’t usually take a physical inventory until year end, and
it is early in the year, start anyway, knowing the numbers you are
using may be wrong.
5.
Publish the starting inventory status, and continue to make the
data available on a regular basis to all supply-chain managers.
TIP #6: Rightsizing inventory is the responsibility of every-
one in the supply chain, and performance metrics should
be shared by all links in the supply chain.
You can’t rightsize your inventory if different silos have different
performance measurements. I learned this the hard way. Let me give you
an example. I was a purchasing manager for a textile company, and I
was measured on having a favorable purchase price variance. In other
words, if the standard price was $2 per linear yard for gray goods, and
I was able to buy it for $1 per linear yard, I had a favorable purchase
price variance. If I did this often enough, at the end of the year I was
awarded a bonus. I spent a great deal of time looking for the best deal.
Once I purchased gray goods at considerable savings because the yarn
had a lot of “knots” in it, and the vendor wanted to move it. Looking at
price alone, it was a good deal, so I bought it. However, because of the
knots, the knitting machine kept stopping as the yarn wouldn’t go through
the needles on a consistent basis, resulting in poor productivity. Because
production had low productivity, it didn’t achieve a favorable production
variance. I had a favorable purchase price variance, but it came at the
cost of manufacturing productivity. Needless to say, I got chewed out and
was told to never do that again.
To avoid this happening in your company, do the following:

38

Rightsizing Inventory
1.
Assign the same performance measurements to all supply-chain
managers.
2.
Clearly communicate what the performance measurements are.
3.
Assign metrics that are realistic and achievable.
4.
Provide the tools and resources necessary to help achieve perfor-
mance measurements.
5.
Monitor performance on a consistent basis; don’t wait until the
end of the quarter or year to let them know how they are doing.
TIP #7: Pick a team, establish goals and objectives, bench-
mark where you are, and identify shared performance
measurements. Communicate this to everyone.
In the case of Woodstock, none of the Harmony Team members are
inventory experts per se, except maybe Jack. The team is not skewed to
one particular silo. You may have also noticed that several important links
are missing from the Harmony Team. As I have said earlier, there are too
many links to have them all represented on the team, and not all supply-
chain managers will ﬁt the criteria discussed earlier in this chapter.
Thus far, Woodstock has done a good job of benchmarking where it
is and selecting a team to rightsize its inventory. What they have not done
yet, and what you will learn in later chapters, is to set speciﬁc numeric
goals and objectives. It has stated that it has to rightsize its inventory, but
it has not clearly deﬁned it in terms of numbers. I believe this is the next
step in the process. Knowing where it is and picking the team were
necessary steps before establishing speciﬁc goals. Too often management
sets inventory goals without having a plan in place to accomplish the
objectives.
Woodstock started the year with $40 million worth of inventory. The
Harmony Team’s plan is to:
1.

the roles and problems within each link before you can correctly rightsize
inventory. Many inventory experts say that a focused effort on rightsizing
inventory will result in an inventory reduction of 25 to 40 percent over
the course of the effort. I too, agree with this statement. However, because
Woodstock is like so many small companies with limited resources, a
more realistic goal would be a 15 to 20 percent reduction in total inventory,
along with a gradual shift of inventory location in the supply chain. This
would equate to an inventory reduction of $6 million to $8 million in the
ﬁrst year — a good start.
TIP #8: Delegate authority, accountability, and responsi-
bility to those who can best accomplish the task of right-
sizing inventory in the supply chain.
Adriana, the president of Woodstock, has clearly deﬁned who is
responsible and accountable (all supply-chain managers) and has dele-
gated the responsibility to Joe and the Harmony Team. The team members
were selected because management believes they are the ones who can
best accomplish the effort. What’s left unsaid is that while management
has done this, it is their responsibility to support the team in whatever is
necessary for it to accomplish its goals. The key points here are:
1.
Remove politics when selecting the team.
2.
Pick people who can best accomplish the effort.
3.
Management must provide support and encouragement.
4.
The team should be prepared to spend 25 to 35 percent of its
workday on the effort.
5.
The daily operating environment cannot suffer because of the effort.
6.
Team members should delegate their daily workload where
possible.
TIP #9: Rightsizing inventory is not “just another project”
with a start date and an end date; it has to become a new
way of life for the company.
TIP #9 may be one of the most difﬁcult TIPS to implement. A manu-
facturing company is a dynamic environment. People leave, get ﬁred, or
move on to another position in the company. The company could be
bought or buy another company. There are too many variables to mention.
Here are some points to remember:
1.
Seek small successes.
2.
If someone leaves the team, replace him or her immediately.

40

Rightsizing Inventory
3.
Publicize successes.
4.
Recognize team members, supply-chain managers, and employees
for their efforts.
5.
Keep all employees informed.
TIP #10: Start rightsizing your inventory by aligning your
inventory levels to match your inventory strategies by
product or division classiﬁcations.
TIP #11: Gather inventory data by type, location, and
business segment. Compare it to the corporate inventory
strategy. Any inconsistency in inventory and strategy must
be addressed and corrected.
A good place to start your inventory rightsizing efforts is to align your
physical inventory to your inventory strategy. This is so obvious, yet many
companies miss this one. These TIPS focus on the inventory you already
have. We know it exists — but does the inventory location match your
strategy? That is the question we are trying to address here. The ideal
environment would be to have no inventory, and buy it and make it as
needed. But we have a long way to go to get there.
A good example of a mismatch is the $4 million of inventory that
exists in the Beacon Light Division. The strategy here is make-to-order or
engineer-to-order, yet 50 percent of the inventory for this division is in
ﬁnished goods. Only $.5 million has been identiﬁed with ﬁnished goods
for Field Service. This point could have been missed if we just looked at
the fact that only 13 percent of the ﬁnished goods inventory was for the
Beacon Light Division. What Woodstock should do is focus its efforts on
reducing or eliminating the Beacon Light Division ﬁnished goods inven-
tory. This exercise would show you where to spend your limited resources.
The key points are:
1.
Do not spend a great deal of time on this exercise.
2.
Look for the obvious mismatches in alignment and focus your
efforts in rightsizing those inventories.
3.
Find the root cause as to why the inventory is in the wrong form,
and implement a policy to prevent it from getting out of alignment
again.
4.
Publish monthly reports that show inventory location and value.
TIP #12: Inventory is considered an asset on the company
balance sheet. Inventory is a liability if you have more

Inventory as a Strategic Advantage

41
than you need to satisfy immediate customer require-
ments.
This TIP addresses the philosophy of carrying inventory and speaks to
the whole inventory rightsizing effort. The entire effort begs the question,
“Do we need this inventory?”
TIP #13: The perfect order must be considered from both
the viewpoints of the seller and the buyer. The perfect
order criteria must be measurable so that deviations can
be corrected.
The perfect order is deﬁned earlier in this chapter. The seller’s criteria are
as important as the customer’s. The key points to address here are:
1.
Understand how the customer is measuring your company.
2.
Understand what is important to your company.
3.
Develop measurable criteria and publish it to all employees.
4.
Constantly measure your company’s performance against both
criteria.
5.
Establish ﬂags in your process that alert everyone to unsatisfactory
performance.
6.
Establish action plans to bring the performance measurement back
in line.
TIP #14: Successful supply chains have one characteristic
in common; their ability to rapidly respond to change
throughout their entire supply chain, not just one or two
links in the chain.
Your ability to respond to changes in supply and demand will be one of
your keys to success. There are several key points to address:
1.
Measure your current lead times and throughput times in each link
of your supply chain.
2.
Communicate this to all links in your chain.
3.
Benchmark the best practices for each link of known successful
supply chains.
4.
Establish improvement goals for each link.
5.
Work toward improving each link to meet these goals.
6.
Sustain the improvements.

42

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #15: A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest
link; being world class in one link does you little good if
your other links are weak.
Identify the weakest link in your supply chain, and improve it. Once you
have improved that link, another link will become your weakest link.
Identify it and improve it. Continue this process on an ongoing basis. To
identify your weakest link, look for the link that has:
1.
The most inventory
2.
The longest cumulative lead time
3.
The longest throughput time
4.
The poorest customer (internal and external) satisfaction
5.
The worst comparison to a best-practice company
TIP #16: Deﬁne the perfect order criteria and measure
them. Communicate this to everyone in the supply chain. 
Seek to understand how the customer is measuring their satisfaction
level of doing business with your company. Equally important, understand
how the stakeholders in your company are measuring your success. You
can meet the external customer’s expectations 100 percent, but if your
company is not meeting your stakeholder’s expectations, you won’t be in
business very long and satisfying customers becomes a moot point. The
perfect order criteria deﬁned in this chapter should be compared to your
performance, and where mismatches occur, every effort should be made
to correct them.

ations. They will be updated at the end of each chapter based on the

Is the Customer 
Always Right?
February 14, Harmony Team Meeting
Woodstock Inventory: $41 Million
My name is Maria and I am manager of customer service at Wood-
stock Lighting Group.
I have been here ten years and it isn’t getting any easier. Joe is one pain
in the neck and has the personality of a rock. He needs to think before he
acts and goes off on one of his tangents. I don’t know how Eddie, Cyndie,
and the rest of his people can stand him. I’m glad he isn’t at the meeting.
He would be disruptive and try to show everyone how smart he is. Thank
goodness for Adriana and Arnie. They make a good buffer for us, and I’m
glad they are involved. I hope this meeting doesn’t take long. I’ve got a date
later with a new guy I met the other night, and he is really neat. I want
to get out of here on time, so that I can go home and change before my
date. He’s taking me to a new restaurant I’ve heard about but never been to.
Maybe I should go back into sales. I’ve heard through the grapevine
that they are changing the sales compensation plan and it is going to be
more attractive to sales people. When I was in sales I didn’t have to deal
with the internal politics or other self-serving nonsense. I ﬁnd managing
people to be a challenge today. Everyone here is under pressure and has
too much work to get done. They get cranky and irritable at the most trivial
of things. I think we should have classes here on stress management. Maybe

46

Rightsizing Inventory
I’ll talk to Human Resources about it. I know I could use it! Oh well,
speaking of stress, I should get back to work.
Is the Customer Always Right?
No. The customer isn’t always right. I can speak with authority because
I am a customer and I know I’m not always right. I remember not long
ago, my husband and I bought an exercise machine. It was one of those
deals where it was noted that “some assembly was required.” We’ve all
been there, right? You guessed it. I got to the end of the job (ﬁve hours
later) and had two pieces left over. I didn’t have a clue where they were
supposed to go. We spent another hour reviewing the instructions and
I’ll be darned if we could ﬁgure it out. I called the customer service
number and actually got to speak to a real person. I started venting and
complaining that the instructions were poorly written and that they omitted
part of the instructions.
The customer service representative calmly asked me the model
number and I gave it to him. He politely informed me that those parts
were for a different model number. He went on to say that they pre-
packaged a kit of parts that could be used on various models and that
the two parts were to be used if we had purchased another model. He
pointed out that this was written at the very top of the assembly instruction
sheet. In our excitement to put the machine together, we quickly scanned
the instruction sheet and had missed the part about the different model
numbers. So, I was a customer and I was wrong. We don’t like to publicly
say it; we whisper it among ourselves. Some of our customers should
only know what we say about them behind their backs. However, in the
business world, we wouldn’t be in business long if we took the position
that the customer isn’t always right. We should always keep an open
mind and address any customer complaint from the viewpoint that
customers are right, and most of the time they are. Satisfying our cus-
tomer’s needs is one of two reasons we are in business; the second is
to make a proﬁt for our stakeholders.
TIP #17: The customer isn’t always right, but if you want
to keep customers, you should do all you can to satisfy
their requirements in a professional, businesslike manner.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)
We live in an age of decreasing customer loyalty, increasing customer
choices, deregulation, changing competitive boundaries, and “stealth -

Is the Customer Always Right?

like” Internet competitors. To stay ahead of the curve, we must become
customer focused and willing to maximize the gathering and sharing of
customer knowledge.
As we are in the business of providing products and services to our
customers we have to get it right the ﬁrst time. Our customers expect the
products (inventory) we ship them to meet their expectations. They expect
to receive the right product, in the right quality, in the right quantity, at
the right time. Not too much to ask, is it? No, it is not. So every time we
don’t meet customer expectations, they get upset and we face the potential
of losing a customer. It is hard enough trying to get new customers, so
it is criminal to lose one we already have.
Know Your Customer — Keep Your Customer
It’s very competitive out there today, and customers demand value for
their money. If we don’t provide value, they will go to another supply
chain that will. Customer expectations have risen to a level where they
require instantaneous information about their order and they expect
delivery of our products in days, not weeks. Knowing what our customers
want is an order qualiﬁer today; anticipating their needs is an order
winner. Order qualiﬁers are providing a quality product/service at the
right price and at the right time. Without these order qualiﬁers, we can’t
even get into the game. On the other hand, an order winner is some
characteristic that causes customers to buy our products/services, rather
than someone else’s.
TIP #18: Understanding the customers’ needs is a good
thing, but anticipating your customers’ needs is an order
winner that will help you sell more inventory.
Let’s discuss a few key attributes of customer expectations today. First
of all, they expect us to be extremely ﬂexible, respond to new orders
quickly, and respond to changes in existing orders quickly. They may ask
us to move an order in or ask us to delay an order and move it further
out into the future. They may increase the order quantity or decrease the
order quantity. The bottom line is we must become very ﬂexible in our
manufacturing and distribution links. We have to become customer literate.
Customer literacy is knowing all we can about our customers. Some
companies call this customer intimacy. It goes beyond looking at the
internal quantitative data we have about our customers and what they
have bought from us in the past.

48

Rightsizing Inventory
Customer literacy is knowing what new products they have in devel-
opment, what products they are phasing out of their product lines, and
what their inventory strategy is for the future. We should be working with
them on new product designs. Customer literacy is knowing their general
business health. Do we even know if a major customer is in ﬁnancial
trouble? If our management knows, they certainly aren’t telling us. I’m a
customer service manager and my performance metric is based on accu-
rately processing customer orders and answering their questions about
the status of their orders.
I spend eight to ten hours a day on the phone with customers or other
links in our supply chain, getting information and passing it on to our
customers. I would love to anticipate our customers’ needs and become
proactive. The worse part of my job is dealing with our internal marketing
and sales organization. They are even more demanding than the customers,
and often quite rude. As I’ve known many of the customers for years,
they call me up directly to get answers to their questions rather than
contacting their sales representative. The sales reps get upset and don’t
like this. They want to be the ones talking to their customers, except of
course, if the information going to the customer is “bad news”; then they
are very happy we are the ones talking to the customer.
We waste a lot of time telling the sales reps what we already told the
customer. There have been instances when the customer is given two
different answers to the same question; this is a big problem and must
stop. It confuses the customer, wastes their time and ours. This is a very
good example of working as individual silos rather than one collaborative
network. I strongly suggest that the Harmony Team work with us and the
sales force to establish an operating policy and procedure that presents
a clear and direct line of communication with our customers. We should
consider providing every customer with a Woodstock company directory
of who to contact for certain information. This will free up our sales force
to focus on satisfying our customer’s future needs, rather than on issues
related to past and current sales.
The Customer’s Customer
I have been talking a lot about the customer, but who is our customer? Is
it the company we sell to or the person who uses our product? If you
look at our three divisions, we have different deﬁnitions of who the
customer is, and we need to understand this. Table 2.1 shows an example
of our expanded supply chain. In the case of the ﬂashlight division, our
customers are distributors, and their customers are retail stores. The retail
stores sell to the end users, who are downstream in our supply chain.
Taking this a step further, when a product is scrapped, the recycling

Is the Customer Always Right?

49
company is further downstream. In some cases, the recycled material comes
back to us as a raw material, closing the loop; interesting how that works.
Our strategy and planning must go beyond identifying our customers’
needs. We must look at the ultimate end users of our products and get
as much input about them and their marketplaces as we can. Including
our customer’s customer in our supply-chain planning is often called the
extended supply chain. Figure 2.1 is a simpliﬁed version of our supply
chain and looks like any other supply chain. However, Figure 2.2 is an
example of our extended supply chain for the Flashlight Division.
A large part of understanding customer requirements will involve
recognizing the trends, economics, and other market forces that impact
the end user. We sell ﬂashlights to distributors, who sell to stores, who
in turn sell to consumers like you and me. We need to understand who

our customers are, and we need to understand why the consumer is
buying ﬂashlights. Is it for emergency use? Are they going camping? On
average, how many ﬂashlights does the consumer own? We sell millions
of ﬂashlights. Are people replacing them or did they lose them?
Think about your personal life. Pens and umbrellas come to mind.
I mean, come on, how many pens or umbrellas do you need? The truth
of the matter is we probably buy these products because we have lost
perfectly good ones. I think this applies to ﬂashlights as well. We also
need to understand what the end users like or dislike about our
products. Their input will be important as we design new products. I
don’t know the exact numbers, but let’s say, for example, that we sell
120 million ﬂashlights a year to 200 distributors, who sell them to
250,000 independent and chain retail stores, who then sell them to 80
million end users.
Referring back to Figure 2.2, if we include all customers in the extended
supply chain, the number of customers increases dramatically. So instead
of 200 customers, we have 80 million customers. That’s a great deal of
customers. We can’t possibly know why all the end users bought ﬂashlights
or how they like or dislike our products. I know that our marketing folks
conduct surveys and have end user focus groups to look at this. In Figure
2.2, the extended supply chain shows only one link in the chain for
Woodstock, and this link, as shown in Figure 2.3, is made up of many
internal links that represent our total enterprise.
The challenge for us is to balance all these elements across both our
internal supply chain and external supply chain. Is it reasonable to assume
that you can have different supply chains for different product lines? The
answer is a resounding yes! For example, spotlights for the emergency
vehicle market are shipped directly to the end users and bypass the
distribution centers. Spotlights for the residential and commercial mar-
ketplaces are shipped to our distributors, who in turn ship to the end
users. Flashlights have a different supply chain. Our plant ships to our
distribution centers, which then ship to the distribution centers of large
chains, or in the case of small local retail stores, they make direct
shipments to the stores.

If you look at our Spotlight Division, economic trends and predictions
may be helpful when planning our inventory strategy. For example, one
of our customer groups for this division consists of home and commercial
builders. There is a great deal of data on new home/building sales, and
trends that will be helpful in planning our inventory strategy for this
customer group. If loan interest rates go down and new construction goes
up, then there is a good chance we will sell more to these customers.
On the other hand, if loan interest rates go up and new construction goes
down, we may sell less to these customers. However, we may increase
sales in the aftermarket by selling spotlights to customers who are remod-
eling their kitchens or bathrooms. These are good examples of why we
need to understand and include our customer’s customers in our extended
supply-chain planning process.

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #19: We must present ourselves as one united, collab-
orative supply-chain network to our customers and estab-
lish clearly deﬁned lines of communication with them.
I would like to understand our customer’s inventory processing ﬂow
better. I don’t know how they process and manage the inventory once it
arrives at their dock. I would love to visit some of our customer sites and
tour their facilities. I would love to meet with personnel in some of their
links such as purchasing, material planning, and warehousing. It’s ironic
that my title is customer service and I don’t know much about the customer
at all. Typically, the only contact I have with the customers is with their
purchasing agents and expeditors. I do, however, know a lot about our
sales reps. I am personal friends with some of them, and they tell me they
have no time to focus on the future. They are motivated by selling today’s
products, and as much of them as possible. A signiﬁcant part of their salary
is commission based, and if they don’t sell now, they don’t get any money
now. It’s all about this week, this month, and this quarter. Either the
company has to change the salary structure in our sales link or ﬁnd other
people at Woodstock who can take the long-term view of customer literacy.
Have you ever wondered about all that “junk mail” you get in your
snail mail and all that spam in your e-mail folder? We provide this
information. How do we do this? With all those airline loyalty cards, credit
cards, magazine subscriptions, Internet site visits, and yes, even your
discount card at the grocery store. We lug these cards around, do all the
work, and spend all the money. This allows companies to build data-
bases about us, our preferences, and buying patterns. Right or wrong isn’t
the point, they just do it. It’s called customer literacy.
TIP #20: Know as much as possible about your customer:
their needs, wants, problems, plans, and who else they
buy from.
Customer Relationship Management
Technology is available today that can help us achieve some level of
customer literacy. Customer relationship management (CRM) is both com-
puter software and a business philosophy. Let’s stick with business phi-
losophy. The whole idea is to know as much as possible about your
customers. The objective of CRM is to know who your customers are and
what their needs are, as well as to anticipate their future needs. The
concept is to integrate all the information about a customer that each of
our supply-chain links has. That includes such links as ﬁnance, sales,

Is the Customer Always Right?

53
marketing, and all the others. In fact, there is a wealth of customer
information in our ﬁeld service link. Has anyone ever asked them what
the customers are saying or doing? From a philosophical point of view,
our sales link must shift from a product focus to a customer focus. We
must know what our customer’s plans are. We have to gather compre-
hensive information, not just data. We need to personalize every transac-
tion and communication with the customer. In fact, the sales link should
take people from the other links out to visit customers. We can turn data
about customers into meaningful information by:

Analyzing the data and developing customer needs by using proven
analytical techniques and sound business models

Benchmarking what our competitors are doing

Finding out how our customers measure inventory (strategy, levels)

Finding out what inventory measurement standards are used for
their industry: Standard Industry Classiﬁcation (SIC) codes

Implementing enabling technologies (software)

Disseminating customer insights learned throughout our supply
chain

Constantly talking to the customer
In fact, you should have customers on the Harmony Team. I’m a little
surprised you haven’t done it already. I know Joe and Adriana are visiting
some key customers and suppliers, but that isn’t going to tell us the whole
story. They are probably only talking to other executives at their level.
This won’t give them the true picture of what’s really going on with the
customer. There is a downside to focusing on “too much data and too
little information.” We have to be careful not to get lost in the trees and
not see the forest. Information and data are a good start, but we need to
see the big picture. It’s important to point out that as we are gathering
information about our customers, they in turn are gathering information
about us. This information transfer goes both ways. In this case, we are
talking about supplier relationship management (SRM). Figure 2.4 shows
the relationship of CRM and SRM in a typical supply-chain network.
With the advent of the Internet, a new reality has established itself:
electronic customer relationship management (e-CRM), or as some people
call it, E-business. This is software that tracks mouse click streams and has
been designed to predict what customers will want before they know what
they want. A company can go straight to a customer and suggest a particular
product rather than sending out millions of solicitations to potential cus-
tomers. If you have ever bought anything from a major online catalog
retailer, you have experienced this. If you go to purchase something and
they are out of inventory, they will suggest a similar product. What’s also

54

Rightsizing Inventory
neat about this is if an item is out of stock, they will tell you when it will
be in inventory. Another example of e-CRM is online book stores. If you
purchase a book, they will suggest other similar books by that author or
about that topic. They will even tell you what other books people have
purchased along with that book. This is inventory management at its best.
TIP #21: A successful supply chain knows its customers
well and can anticipate their inventory needs. In some
cases, it may be an inventory need that they don’t recog-
nize they have.
Example of Inventory and e-CRM Working Together
A friend of mine provides a good example of inventory and e-CRM working
together quite well. He has a horizontal supply chain with one supplier
(who ships directly to the end user), himself (as the lone salesperson),
and 2000 customers (end users). I call this a “virtual supply chain” and
he calls it a “virtual franchise” (I like his term better). His whole food
nutrition product line consists of fruit, vegetable, and grain products that
are inventoried (condensed) into capsule, chewable, and gummy (for
children) forms, a convenient and inexpensive way for any of us, age
two through the elderly, to ensure we get our suggested number of fruit
and vegetable servings each day.
My friend’s role in this supply chain is to educate people on better
preventive health from eating more fruits and vegetables. (I can hear my

mother just as if it were today: “Eat your vegetables or no dessert. They’re
good for you.”) The supplier does everything else. The supplier outsourc-
ers the growing of fruits and vegetables (to farmers) and the manufacturing
process of converting the fruits and vegetables into consumable format.
The supplier then does everything else: storing, picking, packing, shipping
(to the end user), billing, and collection. After the initial sale, the consumer
can place orders directly with the supplier over the Internet. In fact,
sometimes my friend isn’t involved at all.
If a consumer hears about the product somewhere and visits the
supplier Web site to place an order, my friend will get credit for the sale
if it is in his territory. The supplier sets up an agreed-upon shipping
schedule with the consumer. My friend gets credit for the sale, and on a
monthly basis a commission check is electronically deposited into his
checking account. Let’s review this process once again:

He may or may not have direct contact with the customer.

He doesn’t need to place orders with the supplier.

He doesn’t see, own, or physically handle the inventory.

He doesn’t need to keep track of the shipments.

He doesn’t do billing or collection.

Commission checks are electronically transferred to his account.

He gets a commission statement once a month itemizing transac-
tions related to his territory.
In theory, he could take a trip around the world and return a year
later to a satisﬁed customer base, a satisﬁed supplier base, a satisﬁed
stakeholder (himself), and a satisﬁed employee (also himself), completing
the trifecta of the perfect order from the seller’s point of view. Wow, was
I impressed! Realistically, he wouldn’t be in business long if he did ignore
his supplier and customers for a year.
In summary, he has virtual inventory available at his disposal 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week. This allows him the opportunity to succeed in
direct proportion to the time he spends telling prospective clients about
the beneﬁts of his products. The Internet has become the crucial vehicle
in enabling and accelerating the ﬂow of inventory into and out of the
supply chain.
Allowing Customers Access to Our Inventory Information
Something we might consider if we take an e-CRM approach is to have
a two-way sharing of inventory information with our customers. Although

56

Rightsizing Inventory
it’s important to know what inventory items a customer bought, it’s equally
important to understand what was used and how much is left in stock.
Regarding our inventory, we could allow certain customers to access our
inventory information system so that they can see what items we have in
stock, available for sale.
We could take this a step further and let them access our master
production schedule (MPS), so they can see what our manufacturing plans
are. Of course, there is some danger in doing this. For one thing, if they
see we have a lot of inventory on one particular item, they might not
give us an order for it right away, seeing that we have so much. Another
danger would be if they see we have a lot of inventory, they might try
to see if they can get it at a discount because “they are doing us a favor.”
We could, of course, not show inventory quantity and simply say “avail-
able” or “not available.” The big online retailers do this. If you are ﬁlling
up a shopping cart, they will indicate “in stock” or “not in stock.”
In the case of our Spotlight Division, I’m not sure how well this will
work. I can see it working well for our spare parts sold to lighthouses
through our Beacon Light Division and in our Flashlight Division. The
way it works today is the customer will either call me up or contact the
sales representative to ﬁnd out if something is in stock. Sometimes, we
play telephone tag, and if they don’t get us right away, they could be
contacting our competition. We’ll never know if this is happening unless
we can ﬁnd a way of tracking this issue. One other point I want to make
is if we do this with our spare/replacement parts, we would have to
implement a standard operating policy (SOP). If a customer sees that we
have inventory, would they have to call to request it? What happens if
two different customers access the inventory data and both want it? If we
give it to one customer what happens to the other? Can we have them
electronically reserve it? We will have to work out the details and imple-
ment an SOP and maybe modify our computer software to take care of
these concerns.
Asking Our Customers to Allow Us Access to Their 
Inventory Information
The other side of the coin is asking our customers to allow us access to
their inventory and production information. Our salespeople would love
this. From a salesperson’s perspective it could save a lot of time and even
help them anticipate customer needs, just as the CRM philosophy suggests.
They could then spend their time looking into all of those other matters
I talked about, such as ﬁnding out what their inventory strategy is and
what new products they are working on. If we anticipate their inventory

Is the Customer Always Right?

57
needs, we could let our planning and demand management links know,
so that they can take that information under consideration as they develop
their plans. Let’s take it a step further and ask to see their production plans.
Most of our customers use materials requirements planning (MRP)
software, and their planning horizon goes out for at least six months, if
not longer. What great insight that would give us! I’m getting excited just
thinking about it. I know a large manufacturing concern, not in our
industry, that provides its suppliers with MRP output. Every Monday
morning, the ﬁrm makes its MRP output available to its suppliers to see.
All suppliers are given a password that gives them access to all the items
the manufacturer buys from them. In this case, the MRP planning horizon
goes out eighteen months. The suppliers can print this out and distribute
it to all their supply-chain links so that everyone knows what the customer
is doing and plans to do for the next eighteen months.
TIP #22: Don’t keep inventory information a secret. Share
it with your customers. Ask your customers to share their
inventory information with you.
When the Harmony Team meets with the other links, I hope you will
discuss this topic with them. In the meantime, I’ll talk with the powers
that be in the sales link, get some input from them, and see if they will
explore it with their customers. I know I will. In fact, as soon as I leave
this meeting, I’m going to start making some calls. I’ll provide feedback
to Arnie, and if you like, I’ll come back again to discuss it after I get a
feel for how well this will ﬂy. In fact, I know Rudy, our vice president
of sales and marketing, is making a major effort to have our ﬂashlights
sold in one of the largest retail store chains in the world. This chain
provides inventory data access right down to the shelf level in its stores.
With their point-of-sale technology they can tell us in real time when an
item is sold. They are making a big push to have suppliers use radio
frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) so that they can track inventory into and
out of their stores, or for that matter, anywhere in their supply chain. Boy,
talk about customer literacy, this is great stuff! Oh well, let’s move on to
another area of “Know Your Customer — Keep Your Customer.”
Inventory Attributes of Customer Expectations
I understand that last week Arnie described the perfect order from the
customer’s perspective; that’s good. I know this because after your meet-
ing, you and Arnie sent out the minutes of the meeting to all supply-
chain managers, and my boss in turn sent them to me. That’s great

58

Rightsizing Inventory
communication. I hope you continue to keep everyone informed. Let’s
categorize customer expectations of the perfect order into ﬁve areas:

Time

Service

Speed

Flexibility

Price
It should be noted that quality is not mentioned as a separate customer
expectation. It goes without saying that the customer expects quality
products and service. Without quality in all we do, we would soon be
out of business. Because we have been around since 1942, I have to
believe we are doing some things right, but if you listen to many people
at Woodstock, you wouldn’t think so.
TIP #23: Lead time is deﬁned differently for each link in
your supply chain. The most important deﬁnition is related
to customer order lead time: from the time they ask you
to ship the inventory until they receive the inventory.
Time
On the surface, you would think that time and speed should be combined
into one customer expectation. But there are differences. For example, if
the customer requests that you ship the order three weeks from now and
you comply, getting it there exactly three weeks later, then you were “on
time.” You can measure time. However, if the customer says ship the
order as soon as possible, then we are talking about speed. This is a
subtle but important distinction. Arnie told you the customer expects the
order to be shipped and received on time, and this is true. In reality, the
customer doesn’t really care when you ship it, but he or she does care
that it arrived at the site at the time requested. This is an important point.
Lead time, although a simple concept, can be quite different for each of
our three divisions. Our supply chain needs to understand this difference.
Inventory in our supply chain has to be treated differently for each of
our divisions. We can’t take this customer metric lightly. All customers
measure on-time delivery. Some customers measure it in more detail than
others. There is a big difference between cumulative supply-chain lead
time and customer delivery lead time. Cumulative supply-chain lead time
deals with all those activities that have to be accomplished to make our
product available to be shipped.

Is the Customer Always Right?

59
Our Materials Management link is concerned with the longest cumu-
lative lead time necessary to make a product available for shipment. For
example, the longest cumulative manufacturing lead time of product
number 092152 depicted in Figure 2.5 is shown as 12 weeks. That is, 7
weeks for part #E, 3 weeks for part #B, and 2 more weeks for part #A:
7 + 3 + 2 = 12 weeks.
If our planning horizon (the amount of time our plan extends into the
future) only goes out 11 weeks, we would miss purchasing part #E in a
timely manner. Unless we had safety stock of the component, part #E,
we would be asking our supplier to expedite it. To make matters worse,
we may have to pay a premium for the part and also may incur air freight
charges. Knowing our cumulative lead time is important. Keep in mind
that our customers only care about delivery lead time and not cumulative
lead time. Delivery lead time is deﬁned as the period from the time they
give us the order until they receive it.
As demanding as customers can be, they are also reasonable. Some
customers give their suppliers what is known as a delivery lead time
window. For example, I know of one customer who uses a 15-day lead
time window. An order is considered on time if it is received anywhere
from 10 days early to 5 days late. This gives the supplier a 15-day window
to be considered on time. In the long run, shipping 10 days early means
we can bill our customer earlier and (hopefully) get paid 10 days earlier.
The customer may also measure different product lines separately using
the same criteria. They may deﬁne parts as A, B, or C, with As being the
most important and Cs being the least important. Then they will grade
the supplier accordingly. It may look something like this:
Figure 2.5

Rightsizing Inventory
A parts: 20 shipments, 18 on time and 2 not on time, 90
B parts: 15 shipments, 10 on time and 5 not on time, 67
C parts: 18 shipments, 14 on time and 4 not on time, 78
On the surface, it looks like we are doing well (not great) on As and
poorly on Bs and Cs. But the customer may apply a weighting factor and
apply more weight to As and less weight to Bs and Cs. In the example
cited previously, the supplier may receive a poor grade on As and a better
grade on Bs and Cs.
TIP #24: We need to understand not only what inventory
metrics our customers are using but also how they are
using (calculating) it.
Service
On-time delivery isn’t the only attribute our customers are looking for. As
Arnie mentioned, the perfect order has many service metrics, including
having the correct paperwork, shipping in the correct container, and a
clearly deﬁned reverse logistics policy. We should be concerned about all
four stages of service:
1.
Stage one — presales: They expect our sales representatives to
be well informed about the characteristics of our products and to
quote achievable delivery dates. They expect to get instantaneous
answers to their questions. Today we do this pretty well.
2.
Stage two — order placement and fulﬁllment: After they give
us an order they expect us to follow up and ensure that it is
delivered on time. If we are going to be late, we should let them
know and give them a new delivery date. They also expect us
(and this is key) to honor any changes to the order that they
require. We must be able to respond to any change requested by
the customer. Today we are not good at this.
3.
Stage three — postsales: This is after shipment follow-up. Today,
we are terrible at this; especially our Flashlight Division. We don’t
have a procedure in place to follow up on how well our overall
service was to our customer. Our sales representative may ask the
customer if everything was all right with the shipment, but this is

Is the Customer Always Right?

61
done on an adhoc basis, with no formal feedback to other links
in our chain except, “we shipped the order on time.”
4.
Stage four — post postsales: By this I mean, don’t just follow
up on particular shipments. Follow up on overall customer satis-
faction with the entire order experience. What did we do wrong?
How can we make it better? What did you like about the experi-
ence? Too often companies stop at stage three. The bottom line
is: Are you really asking what we have to do to get more of your
business? Stage four closes the loop so that we can enter the cycle
at stage one again.
TIP #25: All stages of the sales cycle are equally important
and should be measured throughout the entire supply chain.
Speed
I alluded to the difference between an on-time and speedy response when
I discussed on-time delivery. Speed is also measurable. It deals with how
quickly we can react to something in our supply chain. Examples of speed
include the following:

How quickly can we ship a new order?

How quickly can we give the customer or our suppliers information?

How quickly can we design a new product?

How quickly can our service department respond to a customer
emergency?

How quickly can our maintenance department respond to an
unplanned machine downtime?

How quickly can we ramp up production?

How quickly can we ramp down production?
All of these are measurements of speed. World-class supply chains
recognize that speed is an important differentiator for customers. All these
attributes of speed are measurable. How many of them do we measure
here at Woodstock, two or three? Who outside of the link measuring it
knows what our performance in that area is?
Flexibility
It is difﬁcult to separate speed and ﬂexibility. They go hand in hand. For
example, you would gain ﬂexibility by cross-training the workforce on
the factory ﬂoor, so that a person becomes skilled in knowing how to

62

Rightsizing Inventory
operate different types of machines. Being able to shift people around to
different machines would give you ﬂexibility in your capacity and capa-
bilities. How quickly you respond to change, and move those people to
other machines, would be the speed aspect of this attribute. Another
example would be related to machine setup time. Machine setup time
can be deﬁned as the time the last piece of a part is made until the ﬁrst
piece of the next part is made. In other words, the amount of time needed
to change a machine over from making part A to making part B. You can
measure this as speed. But it does you little good to be very quick (speed)
if you don’t have an operator available to run the machine (ﬂexibility).
Price
So far in this section we have discussed four major attributes of customer
expectations: time, service, speed, and ﬂexibility. All four are equally
important, but it is the ﬁfth attribute that ties it all together: price. You
can have short lead times, speedy delivery, great service, and incredible
ﬂexibility, but if you can’t provide all that at a reasonable price, the
customer will look somewhere else. We live in a global economy. That
means there is a great deal of competition out there looking to sell their
inventory to our customers. If we can’t offer our inventory at a reasonable
price, our competition will take business from us. Because of the number
of competitors offering similar products, we are not in a position to raise
our selling prices on our products. We have to look at reducing our costs
as a means of becoming proﬁtable. The formula is simple:
Proﬁt = Revenue costs
If you take costs as a category and look at cost of goods sold (COGS)
as shown in Table 2.2, you will see that material cost is the largest
component of COGS. In our case, material cost is 55 percent of COGS.

Is the Customer Always Right?

63
This is an area we need to address, but I’m not going to discuss this
now. We have other people more qualiﬁed than me who can give you
input on this. I am only making the point that we must look to reduce
our costs so that we can maintain/reduce our selling price to make a
proﬁt — something we haven’t done for a couple of years.
Inventory Attributes of Woodstock Expectations
The ﬁve inventory attributes of customer expectations must be balanced
against the three inventory attributes of Woodstock expectations:

Customer satisfaction: We have met all 12 expectations of the
customer’s deﬁnition of the perfect order.

Stakeholder satisfaction: The order was proﬁtable to the company.

Employee satisfaction: Processing the customer order was an enjoy-
able experience for employees.
Similar to the ﬁve attributes of customer expectations, the three
attributes of the company expectations can be measured as well. There
must be synergy between the customer and company measurements. What
good will it do us to get a perfect score on a customer order if we lose
money on every order and our employee turnover rate is 30 annually?
I’m exaggerating. Actually, our employee turnover rate is quite low. It’s
somewhere around 10. The customer order is a contract, and similar to
every contract there must be a beneﬁt/reward for both parties.
The Balanced Scorecard
In 1992, Drs. Robert S. Kaplan and David Norton introduced the Balanced
Scorecard (BSC). This tool can be used to measure supply-chain perfor-
mance in different areas of the supply chain. What’s unique about the
BSC is that it offers a “balanced” perspective of supply-chain performance
based on four elements:
1.
Customer: This aspect offers a perspective of how the customer
views our performance and looks at on-time delivery performance,
satisfaction with customer service, and customer-related reliability
issues.
2.
Financial: Making money is not going out of style soon, it is still
a key performance metric, and it is included as one of the four
elements of BSC.

64

Rightsizing Inventory
3.
Business process: This element focuses on measuring such sup-
ply-chain goals as productivity gains, elimination of waste, and
response time.
4.
Innovation and learning: This element deals with product and
process innovations and can include formal training programs for
company personnel.
The BSC is a good set of metrics that we can use to measure our
overall supply-chain performance. You should discuss this with Adriana
as a tool we can use to measure our performance in the future. I realize
that management will want aggregate performance measurements, and
operations will want detailed item (physical) measurements. I believe we
can use BSC to satisfy both areas. This will help us keep our Woodstock
goals and objectives aligned with our customer goals and objectives.
We don’t want to learn the hard way as one major equipment maker
did. In 2001, it declared an inventory write-off of $2.5 billion of surplus
raw materials (scrap), one of the largest inventory write-offs ever in the
United States. This was a case of the customers and their suppliers not
aligning their goals and objectives into one collaborative supply-chain
network. There’s an old saying that pops into my head every once in a
while. I don’t know who said it. If I did I would give them credit. One
thing is for sure, it wasn’t me. Let me present it as a TIP:
TIP #26: It’s nice to know how good we are; we have to
know how bad we are.
Inventory Life Cycle and the Customer
Inventory is like a living and breathing entity. It’s born (created), it grows,
it matures, it ages, and alas at some point it dies (becomes obsolete). The
six stages of the classic inventory life cycle are depicted in Figure 2.6.
The customer should play an important role at every stage of the product
life cycle.
Development Stage
First, let me identify the customer, who plays a very important role in this
stage — not only the external customer who buys our product, but the
internal one as well. This includes all 19 major links in our supply chain.
However, let’s start with the external customer. The customer should be
involved at the very beginning and be part of our product development
team. Who better knows what the end user is looking for in a product

Is the Customer Always Right?

65
than our customers? They can help us create form, ﬁt, and function in
our product design. Granted there is no immediate impact on inventory,
yet everything decided in the design phase will have a signiﬁcant impact
in the other inventory life stages.
For example, take the Beacon Light Division, where we might create
an entire light system, including electronic sensors. Our customers might
tell us that they never use that particular part of the system, because it is
too complicated or simply not needed. If we knew this up front, we could
eliminate the sensor altogether, thus reducing the material and labor cost
of the system. We wouldn’t know this unless they are part of the process
from the beginning. Our internal customers also have a lot to contribute.
Manufacturing might discover that it can reduce the number of different
springs used in our ﬂashlights from three different ones to one particular
type. Product development (engineering) might have designed it with
three different springs because the batteries ﬁt really well with these, but
manufacturing may ﬁnd a better way of making the product use only one
type of spring in all three places. Better yet, it may ﬁnd a way of eliminating
a spring and tell us that only two springs are needed. This means we
could carry fewer part numbers in inventory, and maybe even less inven-
tory. I bet if we took the time we could get meaningful design input from
all links in our supply chain, including our suppliers. The concept of
getting everyone involved up front is called concurrent engineering or
simultaneous engineering.
TIP #27: Get all supply-chain links involved in the product
design phase. Decisions made in this phase will have a
signiﬁcant impact on inventory in all the other inventory
life-cycle phases.

Rightsizing Inventory
Introduction Stage
During the introduction phase, we are just starting to roll out the product.
In this phase, customers don’t buy a lot of inventory. In fact, we sometimes
give the product to customers on a promotional basis. During this phase,
we begin to buy and make inventory. As it is a new product in which
we don’t have any history, we use a forecast based on demand for similar
products. For the Flashlight Division (make-to-stock), we buy raw materials
and produce ﬁnished goods for stock. This is in alignment with our
inventory strategy mentioned at a previous meeting. Overall, aggregate
inventory and sales are still low at this point in the product life cycle.
Inventory stockouts may be high at this point because we haven’t built
up safety stock inventory.
Growth Stage
During the growth phase, both sales and inventory increase as more
customers begin to buy the new product. Inventory begins to shift down-
stream in our supply chain and has to be carefully monitored. We have
to be very careful in this stage because there is a high risk associated
with stockouts. The customers in this stage have no brand loyalty, and if
our product is not available they may switch to our competitors’ products.
Maturity Stage
During this stage, sales continue to increase, but at a slower rate. It is at
this stage in which inventory is the most volatile, and it can quickly get
out of control. Inventory decisions made at this phase will impact decisions
on how we deal with inventory during the last two phases of the inventory
life cycle. Inventory should be held as far upstream in our supply chain
as possible.
Decline Stage
As the market becomes saturated, sales decline, technology in the products
may become outdated, and production drops off. Customers are watching
their inventory levels carefully because like us, they don’t want to be
stuck with obsolete inventory. In this stage, we begin to reduce inventory
in all three categories: raw material, work-in-progress, and ﬁnished goods.
The one inventory area that is an exception to this policy is the spare
parts inventory used by our Field Service organization. The life cycle for

Is the Customer Always Right?

67
spare parts is now in the growth phase. It will be some time later that
this inventory life cycle reaches the maturity, decline, and exit phases.
Exit Stage
When we get to this stage, all categories of inventory should be at zero.
Our reverse logistics policy and strategy must be coordinated with our
market exit policy. If we exit a market, do we want to continue to receive
returns? We have to have a policy in place on how to deal with this well
before we reach this stage in the product life cycle.
TIP #28: All categories of inventory must be aligned with
the product life-cycle strategy and must be aligned well
before moving out of that particular product life-cycle
phase.
Aligning Woodstock Inventory Levels with the Product 
Life Cycles
We have done an analysis of our inventory level as it relates to the
product life cycle. Using annual dollar usage as the criteria, we looked
at the top ten products in our product line and worked with marketing
and sales to determine where they were in the product life cycle. Granted
this was not very scientiﬁc, yet we were looking at the “order of
magnitude.” In other words, we were looking for any obvious mismatches
between inventory levels and product life cycles. We then took the top
20 raw materials with the highest dollar value and ran a “where-used”
report to determine if any of the high-value raw materials went into any
of the top ten products. We found that ten of the raw materials (50
percent) ﬁt those criteria.
Of the ten raw materials, we found two glaring mismatches between
the raw material level and the product life cycle. Let’s call them raw
material A and raw material B. Raw material A goes into a ﬂashlight that
is in the decline stage of its product life cycle, yet we have a high-dollar
value of the raw material inventory worth almost $150,000, an obvious
mismatch. Raw material B goes into a spotlight product that just reached
the market decline stage and is entering the market exit phase; another
mismatch. This represents inventory worth another $75,000. 
In fact, marketing wasn’t even aware that although it was planning an
exit strategy, there was still an open purchase order for new raw materials.
How this happened we’ll never know. The purchasing agent who placed

68

Rightsizing Inventory
the order is no longer with our company. This was a $5,000 purchase
order and, fortunately, we were able to cancel it. So there you have it. It
may not be scientiﬁc, but it does help us focus on reducing the $225,000
raw material, and it provided us with a sanity check on product life cycles.
We have made everyone aware of this issue. Sales and manufacturing are
working together to move this inventory out of our supply chain as soon
as possible.
TIP #29: Focus on high-value inventory items ﬁrst. This
will have the greatest impact on aligning inventory in your
supply chain.
Inventory and Customer Service Levels
I can’t conclude this presentation without offering some insight on how
inventory, or the lack of it, affects our level of customer service. There
are two general concepts of inventory used here at Woodstock. Concept
number one: The higher the level of customer service desired, the higher
the level of inventory in our supply chain. Concept number two: the more
complex our supply chain becomes, the higher the amount of inventory
in our supply chain. I wish this weren’t true, but until we can get our act
together there is a direct correlation between customer service level and
inventory level that we maintain. Having excess inventory isn’t always
related to customer service levels, and we can’t blame our customers for
a lot of our inventory problems.
TIP #30: High inventory levels cannot always be blamed
on the need for safety stock, because of customer uncer-
tainty. More often than not, other problems cause the high
levels of inventory.
This inventory isn’t just in one category. Because of the uncertainty of
supply and demand, we keep a lot of inventory. Instead of looking at
inventory from the traditional viewpoint of raw material, work-in-progress,
and ﬁnished goods, let’s look at it from a functional viewpoint. In other
words, besides the need to ﬁll customer orders, why does inventory exist
in our supply chain?
Why Inventory Exists in the Supply Chain
Other causes of high levels of inventory are discussed in the following
paragraphs:

Is the Customer Always Right?

69
1.
Safety stock inventory: Safety stock, sometimes referred to as
buffer inventory, is kept because of the uncertainty of customers
(demand) and suppliers (supply). We keep safety stock of ﬁnished
goods in our Flashlight Division because we don’t want to have a
stockout condition on a customer order. When ﬁnished goods are
shipped to a customer, we need to replace the quantity shipped
out, or we will eventually run out of ﬁnished goods. We keep safety
stock of raw materials so we won’t run out of them when it is time
to replace the ﬁnished goods. In other words, safety stock exists
at the raw material and ﬁnished goods level as a buffer against the
uncertainty of supply and demand. You’ve heard from others that
as a general rule we should have no inventory beyond satisfying
immediate customer needs. If we were to follow that principle, we
would have no inventory at all — but we have inventory worth
over $40 million. However, it’s not all because of safety stock. It’s
also because of the other functions of inventory, which follow.
2.
Lot size inventory: Some of that $40 million inventory exists
because of the lot size rules of our manufacturing plant and some
of our suppliers. For example, if we need 500 lenses for a customer
order and it is a purchased part, our supplier may require that we
buy a lot size of 1000; the price will be tripled if they have to
break the lot size. So after using the 500 to satisfy the customer
order, the other 500 go into inventory. Again the impact of satisfying
a customer requirement results in more inventory that has nothing
to do with safety stock.
3.
Anticipation inventory: Another function of inventory to protect
against a stockout on a customer order is called anticipation inven-
tory. Twice a year we shut down our manufacturing plant (July and
December) for one week, so that our employees may go on holiday.
As a common practice, we increase inventory levels just before
these shutdowns so that we will have ample inventory to satisfy
customers when we return. Our concern is that we won’t be able
to satisfy new customer orders when we open again for production.
4.
Transportation inventory: This is sometimes called pipeline
inventory and is deﬁned as inventory in transit. This can be raw
materials in transit to our manufacturing plant, or ﬁnished goods
in transit to our distribution centers across the country. The greater
the distance (geography) to the plant or distribution center, the
greater the quantity of inventory in the pipeline. We buy quite a
few components overseas, and this adds to our total inventory.
5.
Hedge inventory: Sometimes we buy/make inventory based on
some potential event that may or may not occur. For example, if
we hear that there might be a shortage of a particular raw material

70

Rightsizing Inventory
that is critical to our product line, we may buy more than we need
just in case this shortage does occur. We may get word that a key
supplier may close its doors for good, and few suppliers provide
this product, so again, we may buy more than we need for the
foreseeable future.
6.
Work-in-process buffer stock: Don’t confuse this with the buffer
stock I referred to when I spoke of raw material and ﬁnished
goods inventory stock. In this case, our manufacturing plant has
extra inventory between manufacturing processes to protect against
uncertainty in our manufacturing process. For example, spotlight
assembly and test is a work center in our plant that we consider
a bottleneck. A bottleneck is a manufacturing resource whose
capacity is less than the demand placed on it. As a general rule,
we never want the bottleneck work center to run out of work;
hence the need for extra buffer inventory.
7.
Distribution inventory: We have three distribution centers and
the inventory in each of these centers pretty much mirrors the
inventory of the others. It is a statistical fact that our total inventory,
including safety stock, could be less if we only had one distribution
center.
8.
Inventory planning rules: This is one of my favorites. Let me
deﬁne this by using an example. Suppose that when you went
home Friday night, you had ten generators (Beacon Light sub-
assembly) in inventory and no customer orders for them. You’re
in good shape on this item, right? Now suppose you run MRP over
the weekend. Planning can explain what this is when it meets with
you. But for now let me say it is a planning technique that tells
us what parts are needed for a product we plan to make, how
many of those parts are needed, and when those parts are needed.
We don’t use this tool yet, but planning is working hard to
implement it. So remember we had ten in stock and no customer
orders for it. However, your MRP rule is to always have 25 in
safety stock. So now MRP says you are 15 short and you need to
make them. Now suppose you gave MRP another rule that says,
every time you make this part, you need to make 50 of them (for
whatever reason, probably ﬁnancial). When you come to work
Monday morning, MRP will tell you to expedite an order for 50
as soon as possible. So here you are with ten in stock that you
don’t need, and you’re being told to rush a new order for ﬁfty.
And guess what? It goes through that bottleneck work center I
mentioned earlier. I have found planning rules to be a big problem
here at Woodstock.

Is the Customer Always Right?

9.
Inaccurate inventory record keeping: This is another good
reason why inventory exists. We recently had a good example of
this. Our perpetual inventory transaction system indicated that we
were out of stock on part #92152, and we needed to buy 5,000
of them @ $2.00 per unit for a total of $10,000. So purchasing
placed an order for 5,000 pieces, and they have just come in. The
year-end physical inventory that we just took shows that we have
15,000 of these in the storeroom. This part has a very small
footprint and was hidden behind a different part that has a much
larger footprint.
If you ask Jose, the storeroom manager, why our records didn’t
show this in stock, he will tell you he doesn’t know. He will give
you lots of probable reasons for this. He told me that the shipping
and receiving department is understaffed and it is often rushed to
get shipments out; received goods to be put away are cast aside
at the time. He has no space left because of all the stock. And
one more for good measure, he doesn’t do cycle counting on a
regular basis. So you see there are a lot of probable causes for
this. The bottom line is that everyone was surprised by the results
of the physical inventory.
10.
Lack of inventory accountability: No one, yet everyone, is
responsible for the high level of inventory that exists. Sounds
confusing, huh? Well, let me explain. Up until now, the level of
inventory was not a part of anyone’s performance measurement.
Therefore, no one is responsible. However, it seems as if every-
one has been involved at one time or another. Sales keeps
pushing for more and more ﬁnished goods. Manufacturing
doesn’t want to run out of work, so it makes stuff just to keep
the machines running. On top of that, purchasing keeps bringing
in stuff because it is measured on having a favorable purchase
price variance. Buying large (lot size) quantities helps purchasing
achieve this — and they get a bonus for doing it! I could go on
and on, but I won’t. The point is, everyone is responsible for
causing our inventory level to be at record levels. Therefore, no
one, yet everyone, is responsible for inventory levels being what
they are today.
TIP #31: Inventory levels will remain unabated and uncon-
trolled until accountability, responsibility, and shared per-
formance metrics are assigned, measured, and
communicated to all links in the supply chain.

Rightsizing Inventory
I see that Pat from ﬁnance and accounting is presenting at the next
Harmony Team meeting. She will provide you with some good insight
on what it is really costing us to have so much inventory.
Inter-Ofﬁce E-Mail
To: Supply-Chain Managers
February 14
From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory Level: $41 million (no change since
February 2, but up $1 million since the ﬁrst day of the
year)
Discussion Summary:
We have made some small progress since our last
report. We have begun to align our inventory levels
with our inventory strategy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t
show in the numbers yet. The sales department has
been a big help by starting to work off the beacon light
ﬁnished goods inventory, which didn’t match our
inventory strategy at all. Purchasing has begun to look
at the ﬂashlight raw material and work-in-process
inventory, which as you now know was at 46 percent of
the total ﬂashlight inventory, another mismatch
between inventory, levels, and inventory strategy.
Thanks to all for working together on this. Today, we
received some great education from Maria in customer
service. She pointed out some discrepancies between
our product life cycles and our inventory levels. The
following is what we learned along with some to-dos
(the details will be distributed to all as part of the meet-
ing minutes):
1.
Even though customers aren’t always right, we should
make every effort to satisfy their needs.
2.
We will adapt a business philosophy of CRM, where
we will learn as much as possible about our custom-
ers so that not only can we satisfy their current needs,
but anticipate their future needs as well.
3.
Human resources (HR) will coordinate education and
training programs for employees on CRM.

Is the Customer Always Right?

73
4.
IT will start to look for CRM application software that
will help us become “customer intimate.”
5.
We will adapt an extended supply-chain approach,
which includes our customer’s customers.
6.
We will begin to share inventory information with our
customers.
7.
We will focus our efforts on the ﬁve inventory
attributes of customer expectations and the three
inventory attributes of Woodstock expectations (see
minutes).
8.
We will seek to understand how customers measure
our performance.
9.
We are in the process of aligning our inventory levels
to match our product life cycles. We have already
found two parts in which there is a signiﬁcant imbal-
ance. We have asked purchasing to continue looking
into this.
10.
Operations will work with HR to shift employees into
the shipping/receiving department. Shipping says it
is short-handed, and it is causing inventory problems.
11.
We have learned there are many reasons that inven-
tory exists in our supply chain, and we will have to
look into all ten reasons.
12.
As we continue this process we will need to assign
responsibility, accountability, and shared perfor-
mance metrics to all supply-chain processes.
These are the highlights from the meeting. If after read-
ing the minutes you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to stop by or call. Let’s keep it up, we are mak-
ing progress!
At the last Harmony Team meeting we published the
beginning of an analytical inventory model (Chapter 1,
Figure 1.10) that we should use as a guideline to right-
sizing our inventory. We have added to the model in
Figure 2.7. At this time, I believe we should include CRM
as a major input to our inventory strategy. The inputs
from CRM include the following:

Customer orders/contracts

Customer forecast of future inventory requirements

Customer inventory status

Customer inventory strategy

74

Rightsizing Inventory

Customer inventory plans

Customer new product development

Customer supply chain inventory logistics (how
inventory ﬂows through their supply chain)

Methodology for integrating these activities into our
inventory strategy and planning process
Sales and marketing will provide us with some more
details on CRM. I know for a fact that forecasting cus-
tomer requirements is a big problem, and I’m sure we
will hear a lot about it when we meet.
Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
In this chapter, I have added 15 more TIPs for rightsizing inventory and
have expanded the inventory model to include customer requirements
and expectations. The following discussion will review each of the TIPs
and how you can apply them to your company:
TIP #17: The customer isn’t always right, but if you want
to keep the customer, you should do all you can to satisfy
their requirements in a professional, businesslike manner.
Common sense tells us we should never be rude to customers no
matter how angry they get with you. In Chapter 1, I discussed the perfect
order from the viewpoint of both the buyer and seller. It is important that

you understand your customers’ and stakeholders’ expectations and satisfy
them, but that’s not enough. It will do your company little good if only
one or two links understand this. All links must share in understanding
these expectations and meeting them. Here is a checklist you can follow:
1.
Ask your customers what they consider the perfect order.
2.
Ask your own management team what it considers the perfect order.
3.
Identify the performance metrics your customer is using to measure
your performance.
4.
If it is a numeric measurement, ask how they calculate it.
5.
Establish and measure your own performance to the customer’s
requirements.
6.
Communicate all this to every link in your supply chain.
7.
Take proactive measures to keep performance at the highest level
possible.
8.
Take reactive measures when performance is below the established
standard.
TIP #18: Understanding the customers’ needs is a good
thing, but anticipating your customers’ needs is an order
winner that will help you sell more inventory.
You can anticipate your customers’ needs by getting actively involved
in their business. You don’t want to become overbearing and bothersome,
but you must ﬁrst understand their needs before you can anticipate them.
There are several ways you can do this:
1.
Make visits to the customer, not just the buyer, and meet with
other links in their supply chain. There are several important links
in addition to purchasing:

Planning department: What tools does it use to plan inventory?
How far out into the future do inventory plans go … ?

Product development: What new products is the department
working on? What will the manufacturing process be … ?

Marketing: What is marketing’s forecast for future sales? Are any
products being discontinued (that include your products) … ?

Accounts payable: Are there any invoicing issues? Is your paper-
work in order … ?

Manufacturing: How is your product used in manufacturing’s
product? Are there any issues with your product in the manu-
facturing process …?

Warehousing, distribution, receiving: Are they satisﬁed with the
packaging? Are there any damage/return issues … ?

76

Rightsizing Inventory
Several other points should be made here. It shouldn’t be just
the salesperson making these visits. If you’re visiting the plan-
ning department, then take someone from your planning depart-
ment. If you’re visiting the manufacturing department, then take
someone from your manufacturing department. People relate
to those who understand their role in the company and they
may help each other improve the process.
2.
Invite your customer to visit your site — not just the buyer, but
people from other links in the supply chain.
3.
All ﬁndings should be communicated to the appropriate link in
your supply chain.
4.
Form a “Customer Anticipation” committee to review ﬁndings.
Brainstorm to come up with ways to satisfy your customers.
TIP #19: We must present ourselves as one united, collab-
orative supply-chain network to our customers and estab-
lish clearly deﬁned lines of communication with them.
You must be careful here. Too much communication can be harmful
to your relationship. You cannot have three different people from your
company calling the same person to ask a question. The customer will
think you are disorganized and you may even get three different answers
to your question. I have seen this happen more than once. You will be
perceived as a very organized, professional company if you:
1.
Develop and communicate a company policy of who should com-
municate with the customer on speciﬁc issues or questions.
2.
Provide your customers with this policy and list. Be sure to include
phone numbers and e-mail addresses.
3.
Make sure there is a secondary person they can call if the primary
contact isn’t available.
4.
Provide communication coverage based on your customer geog-
raphy. If you are on the East Coast, consider your customers’ needs
on the West Coast.
Examples of inventory-related communication would be:

Inventory returns

Change of order status

Expediting a rush order

Damaged goods

Inventory quantity questions

Is the Customer Always Right?

77
For each of these, provide your customer with a contact name and
ask your customer to do the same. Believe me, although this may seem
a small point, it will be an asset as you try to rightsize your inventory.
TIP #20: Know as much as possible about your customers:
their needs, wants, problems, plans, and who else they
buy from.
Most of this was covered in TIPS #18 and #19 discussed previously,
but there is one more important point I would like to make here. So far
I have talked about going direct to your customers to ﬁnd out as much
as you can about them. You can also get information about your customer
from other external sources. Here are some examples:
1.
Go to a credit rating agency to ﬁnd out about their credit.
2.
Attend conferences and meetings where representatives from their
company are speaking.
3.
Ask other customers (their competitors) about them.
4.
Read articles about them in newspapers, magazines, and the
Internet.
5.
Visit their Web site.
TIP #21: A successful supply chain knows its customers
well and can anticipate their inventory needs. In some
cases, it may be an inventory need that they don’t recog-
nize they have.
This TIP works particularly well if you have access to your customer’s
physical inventory or perpetual inventory records. I’m sure you have heard
about the “bread person” who visits the supermarket early in the morning
and removes the stale bread, takes inventory, and replenishes the shelf.
Many manufacturing companies are following this practice today. One of
my clients, a rather large electronics manufacturer, gave certain suppliers
(truck drivers) badges that allowed the delivery person to go directly to
the work cells and restock the inventory rack as needed. No paperwork
exchanged hands on a daily basis. Once a month the supplier would
invoice my client for goods delivered throughout the month.
If you have access to their perpetual inventory system, you can
review their inventory levels and replenish based on a preapproved
policy. I have known instances in which customers didn’t think they
needed inventory and the supplier was able to point out why inventory
was needed.

78

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #22: Don’t keep inventory information a secret. Share
it with your customers. Ask your customers to share their
inventory information with you.
To do this with your customer you have to have a true partnership.
There is a lot of trust involved. In TIP #21, I spoke about your having,
as supplier, access to your customer’s inventory. If you really have a true
partnership, you should allow your customer to access your inventory
also. You have to be careful though; this can come back to bite you. You
have to decide how much information to share. For example, should the
customer have access to the total quantity you have available, or is it
enough to say a product is “available,” “not available,” or “in stock”? The
danger, as I pointed out earlier, is that if you have an enormous quantity
on hand the customer may try to get a price break on the order. On the
other hand, with a partner, there may be nothing wrong with that. I know
I would be willing to consider a price discount if I had too much inventory
in stock. Here are some thoughts to consider:
1.
Allow only true partners access to your inventory.
2.
Inventory information sharing should be both ways.
3.
Decide how much information and what type of information you
want to share.
4.
Establish a policy of how and when the customer can access your
inventory records.
5.
Put procedures in place to ensure against two or more customers
buying the same item at the same time. Don’t think this won’t
happen.
6.
Become proactive; if you have excess inventory you want to move
at a discount (or full price), let your customer know about it.
TIP #23: Lead time is deﬁned differently for each link in
your supply chain. The most important deﬁnition is related
to customer order lead time: from the time they ask you
to ship the inventory until they receive the inventory.
Everyone has a different deﬁnition of lead time, but there is only one
deﬁnition that counts — the customer’s. This is what you can address here:
1.
Ask your customers how they deﬁne lead time and the formula
they use to measure you.
2.
Ask all of your internal supply-chain links to deﬁne their lead times.
3.
Publish an internal directory of lead time deﬁnitions.

Is the Customer Always Right?

79
4.
Establish, measure, and report on all important lead time measure-
ments, starting with the customer.
5.
Ask your suppliers to provide you with their deﬁnitions and current
lead times.
6.
Establish a policy of who can change published lead times and
when changes to lead times should be reported.
7.
Look to reduce all lead times.
8.
Be sure that all elements of lead time are considered. Don’t forget
to include the “paper processing time” and the “authorized approval
time” elements.
TIP #24: We need to understand not only what inventory
metrics our customers are using, but also how they are
using (calculating) it.
Not all customers will use the same metrics to measure your perfor-
mance. Some will place more emphasis on delivery time, whereas others
may focus on ﬁll rates. The following steps need to be taken here:
1.
Ask your customers (using the 80/20 rule) what metrics they are
using to measure their satisfaction with your performance.
2.
Categorize their responses: on-time, complete, quality, etc.
3.
Ask them to provide periodic feedback so there are no surprises.
4.
Measure your performance against their criteria.
5.
Compare their performance results with yours.
6.
If the results are different, take action; ask the customer.
7.
Establish internal warning signals if the performance metric dips
to an unsatisfactory level.
8.
Put procedures in place for corrective action to get the metric back
on track if need be.
9.
Communicate the performance results to all supply-chain managers.
TIP #26: It’s nice to know how good we are; we have to
know how bad we are.
One of the more difﬁcult challenges I have faced as a consultant is
convincing clients that they need to change matters when they are prof-
itable and doing well. The typical response is that “if it isn’t broke, don’t
ﬁx it.” In the dynamic business world we live in today, conditions can
change quickly; a proﬁtable company today can become unproﬁtable
tomorrow. My advice to you is even if things are going well, there is
always something that needs to be improved. No company is perfect; if
you look hard enough and long enough you will ﬁnd something that

80

Rightsizing Inventory
needs to be improved. Identify the weakest link in your supply chain and
improve it. When you have done that, another link will rise to the surface
as your weakest link. This is a never-ending process and should become
part of your company culture.
TIP #27: Get all supply-chain links involved in the product
design phase. Decisions made in this phase will have a
signiﬁcant impact on inventory in all the other inventory
life-cycle phases.
Product design will be covered in more detail in Chapter 6, but there
are some key points that should be made here.
1.
Develop a matrix indicating supply-chain links (planning, sales,
etc.), names of persons from the links who can contribute to the
product design, and what category of inventory management they
have an impact on (packaging, transportation, manufacturing, etc.).
In the Woodstock example, 19 links were identiﬁed.
2.
Meet with the persons identiﬁed in the matrix and get their input
on new product design and improvements to existing products.
3.
Do not attempt to meet with all 19 people at one time. Nothing
will get done.
4.
From the matrix, pick a core team that will be involved from the
beginning to the end of the design phase.
5.
Include external customers and key suppliers on your design team.
6.
Consider using nondisclosure agreements for external supply-chain
links (just in case).
TIP #28: All categories of inventory must be aligned
with the product life-cycle strategy and must be aligned
well before moving out of that particular product life-
cycle phase.
The key to using this TIP successfully is in the timing. You don’t want
marketing to announce one day that product X is being discontinued
tomorrow. You would want a market exit strategy in place well before
the announcement. You should be planning one or two stages ahead in
the product life cycle. The following suggestions relate to the six stages
of the product life cycle.
1.
Development stage: As new product ideas are being identiﬁed and
developed, you should be looking ahead to the next phase (intro-
duction) and answering these types of inventory-related questions:

Is the Customer Always Right?

81

How much inventory will I need for stage 2?

How will the product be introduced to the marketplace?

What will the distribution channel be?

What will the supply chain look like for this product?

What is our inventory strategy going to be (make-to-stock,
make-to-order)?
2.
Introduction stage: During this phase, you should be looking
ahead to the growth phase and answering inventory-related ques-
tions such as:

Can we ramp up production fast enough to meet demand?

Can we ramp down fast enough if demand doesn’t meet
expectations?

What alternative resources are available if internal capacity isn’t
sufﬁcient?

Do we have supply-chain ﬂexibility to cope with changes in
demand?

Should we carry safety stock on this product and, if so, how much?
3.
Growth stage: Looking ahead to the maturity stage, ask yourself
these types of inventory-related questions:

Should we prepare a market exit strategy?

Should we enhance our product to keep it in the growth phase?

Should we change our supply-chain strategy?

Should we change our marketing strategy?

Should we decrease raw material purchases?

How can we use up existing raw materials and subassemblies?

Should we begin to reduce ﬁnished goods inventory levels?
4.
Maturity stage: Looking ahead to the decline stage ask the fol-
lowing inventory-related questions:

Will we have to reduce/shift personnel in production?

Should we reduce selling price to move existing inventory?

Have all raw material contracts been satisﬁed, or are there
outstanding balances on existing blanket orders?

How should we position the product in the marketplace?

Is an exit strategy in place?

How will customers be notiﬁed about the exit strategy?

How do we reduce/eliminate existing inventory?
5.
Decline stage: You have now reached the point where you have
decided that you will no longer invest in the product to enhance
it, and are moving quickly to the exit phase. Inventory-related
questions about the exit phase are:

How can we eliminate all existing inventory?

Have all customers been advised that the product will no longer
be offered?

82

Rightsizing Inventory

Have all legal ramiﬁcations been considered?

Has existing capacity for this product been assigned to other
products?

Has the workforce been reallocated?

Have all marketing materials and programs been stopped?
6.
Exit stage: By the time you get to this stage, all plans are in place
and it just becomes a matter of execution.
What questions to ask, and at what stage they should be asked, is up
to the individual company and the types of products involved. The key
to this TIP is to think well in advance of the life-cycle stage your product
is currently in and prepare plans to address it. Of course, you will need
to recognize that demand for the product is changing and when the
product is entering the next stage. I haven’t discussed products that require
ongoing support and spare parts. In Woodstock, they have the Beacon
Light Division and the ﬁeld service organization in place to support
products well into the future. If you have such products, you will need
to supply spare parts and components well beyond the exit phase. The
key points here are to think ahead and recognize that you are entering
a new phase of the product life cycle.
TIP #29: Focus on high-value inventory items ﬁrst. This
will have the greatest impact on aligning inventory in your
supply chain.
The greatest impact on reducing inventory and realigning inventory
will be focusing on high-dollar-value items ﬁrst. Of course, your situation
may be different. You may have thousands of parts with low value, but
the sum of these parts has a signiﬁcant dollar value. In this situation, you
may want to focus your efforts on those items. I had a client recently
with just such a situation. Because theirs was a make-to-order environment
with very little repeat business and limited ﬁnished goods, we focused
on reducing raw material inventory. I’ll address this TIP in two categories:
Large number of parts with low dollar value by item but large dollar
value in total:
1.
Run an inventory report by usage and list all inventory items with
no activity (no transactions) for 12 months or greater. The theory
here is if you haven’t had any activity on the part for a year, what
is the probability you will ever use it? It’s kind of similar to your
clothes closet. If you have clothes you haven’t worn for a year,
what’s the probability you will ever wear them again? Be careful

Is the Customer Always Right?

83
here. Once you announce you are getting rid of inventory someone
will invariably say, “Once you get rid of it we will need it.” My
client’s answer was: “If you sell it in the future, we will make it
again.” That simple answer seemed to satisfy the sales force.
2.
Run a “where-used” report to identify the “goesintos” (goes into).
If the “parent” part was discontinued, then scrap/sell the goesintos.
If the parent part is active, use the raw material up. If it is an
active part but you have too much inventory, don’t buy any more
and use it up.
3.
Ask product design if the part can be used in another product.
4.
Ask the part supplier if it can take it back for credit or help you
sell it.
Small number of parts with high dollar value:
1.
Use the 80/20 rule to rank the inventory items.
2.
Establish ABC classiﬁcations using some criterion such as “annual
dollar usage.”
3.
Match inventory levels to inventory strategy and focus on inven-
tories not aligned with the inventory strategy.
In Woodstock, the current inventory status (discussed in Chapter 1)
meets the criteria of both scenarios presented here. The reader will learn
how it addressed the inventory issue in subsequent chapters.
TIP #30: High inventory levels cannot always be blamed
on the need for safety stock because of customer uncer-
tainty. More often than not, other problems cause the high
levels of inventory.
Very few companies operate without safety stock. As you rightsize
your inventory and improve your processes, you should be able to operate
with minimal safety stock inventory. Other possible causes of having high
levels of inventory are:
1.
MRP lot-size rules
2.
Minimum-buy requirements of supplier
3.
Poor forecasting
4.
Limited plant capacity
5.
Excessive scrap and rework
6.
Customer order cancellations
7.
Long purchasing lead times
8.
Long production lead times

84

Rightsizing Inventory
This is just a partial checklist of causes that may drive up inventory.
The key to this TIP is to seek the root cause of high inventories and
address it.
TIP #31: Inventory levels will remain unabated and uncon-
trolled until accountability, responsibility, and shared per-
formance metrics are assigned, measured, and
communicated to all links in the supply chain.
This TIP, more than any other, is a key to your inventory rightsizing
efforts. It says a lot:
1.
Assign accountability (who is responsible).
2.
Establish shared responsibility and performance metrics (team-
work).
3.
Monitor and measure performance.
4.
Communicate, communicate, communicate.
Woodstock is a dysfunctional company right now, but you will note
that (see Chapter 1, at the very beginning of the inventory rightsizing
effort) it is taking the steps addressed in this TIP. Unless this TIP is
implemented, your efforts will be minimally successful, at best. This has
to start at the highest levels of management and must continue on an
ongoing basis. Implementation of this TIP will help change the culture of
the company for the better. Table 2.3 is the latest status of the Woodstock
inventory and Table 2.4 shows the annual inventory targets by division.

Having Inventory Costs 
the Company Money
February 25, Harmony Team Meeting
Woodstock Inventory: $40.9 Million
My name is Pat, and I’m director of ﬁnance for Woodstock.
I have been here for ﬁve years now, and it seems like twenty. When are
they ever going to learn that inventory is at the very heart of our cash ﬂow
issue? I have been preaching this to my boss, Colleen, ever since I got here.
But that’s like preaching to the committed. She agrees with me. Joe seems
to think that having lots of inventory solves lots of problems. I think that
having lots of inventory hides lots of problems. If we had put the $40 million
in the bank, we would have made more money than we did these past
couple of years.
At my family’s wholesale business we understood this concept, and
before Uncle Billy sold it to that huge conglomerate, we were very success-
ful. Of course, we were a small business with 14 employees; we commu-
nicated about everything, and we wore multiple hats. In addition to my
duties as controller, I would help out in shipping when we got really busy.
I enjoyed going to work and facing the unknown challenges of the day.
Lately, here at Woodstock, I haven’t enjoyed coming to work. The ﬁrst
thing I do is open the mail to see if any customers sent us payment, and
the second thing I do is call the bank to see if there have been any electronic
deposits to our account.

Rightsizing Inventory
The job interview I had last week with that small wholesale distributor
went really well. It was my second interview, and I believe they will make
me an offer soon. My husband, Joe, says I should get out of here as soon
as possible. I’ve started to bring the problems home with me, and it is
affecting our relationship. I’m thinking I will accept the offer even if it’s
for less pay. The quality of my home life is more important than this job.
That’s just what it is, a job, not a career. Oh, well, time to start the meeting.
Having inventory costs the company money — a lot of money. We
cannot afford the luxury of having $40 plus million in inventory. We have
a long way to go. Let me share with you how bad it is. Unless inventory
is drastically reduced immediately, we will run out of cash and have to
borrow more money from our bank. No one wants that to happen. We
have almost used up our line of credit, and if they call in the loan, we
will be in real trouble. There is an old saying, “It takes money to make
money.” Well, we don’t have any money. Most of our money is tied up
in inventory. Our supply chain needs money for equipment, machinery,
raw materials, supplies, operating expenses, payroll, transportation, ware-
housing, etc. The list goes on and on. One of the primary objectives of
ﬁnancial management is to manage our assets in such a way that we can
achieve the highest possible proﬁt for our stakeholders. If we look at
money from a cash ﬂow point of view, our cash inﬂow has to be greater
than our cash outﬂow. Table 3.1 shows our cash outﬂow and inﬂow.
The only time we have true cash inﬂow is when we sell our products
and services. Even then we have to wait 30 to 90 days for our customers
to pay us. So, if our customers pay us on average in 60 days and we
have to pay our suppliers in 30 days, you can see that our cash-to-cash
turnaround is not good. On top of this, we have a weekly payroll to
meet, monthly operating expenses, bank obligations, and all sorts of other
costs to pay.

Think of your personal cash inﬂow and cash outﬂow. Most of your
cash inﬂow and outﬂow is recorded in your checking account. Your
checking account becomes your record of what happened to your money:
where it came from and where it went. When you get paid, your check
gets deposited into your checking account as cash inﬂow (credit to your
account). When you write out checks, you are withdrawing money from
your account (debit to your account), and this is cash outﬂow. At the end
of any given period of time — let’s say a month — you can analyze your
transactions for the month.
If your month-end checking account balance is greater than your
beginning balance, then you have a positive cash ﬂow for the month. You
increased the equity of your account. If on the other hand, your month-
end balance is less than your beginning balance, you have a negative cash
ﬂow for the month. After a few months of negative cash ﬂows, what’s
going to happen? You will fall behind on your bills and have to look for
alternative ways of getting cash, like dipping into your savings account or
borrowing money. It is no different in the business world.
Budgeting to Monitor Cash Inﬂow and Cash Outﬂow
Analyzing cash inﬂows and outﬂows at the end of an accounting period
is a noble and necessary task, but it is also a passive, reactive task. We
must do a better job of monitoring cash ﬂows. We have established budgets
for the year, yet we don’t do a good job of monitoring them on a daily
or weekly basis. If we did so, we could make adjustments as they get out
of balance. We need to track variances to the budget and report them on
a routine basis so that we can take corrective action. In the future, I would
like to see inventory as a budgeted item. We can set budget levels (value)
for each of the links in our supply chain and monitor it. This would be a
proactive change that will help keep budgets in line. It will show us where
the money is going and what areas are over or under the budget.
We do monitor cash inﬂows a little better. We have an invoice aging
report that shows all invoices due and past due. The report categorizes past
dues in 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-day periods. We even have one invoice past
due by over 365 days, but that is an exception and a whole story unto itself.
Finance and Accounting: Role and Responsibility
One of the primary responsibilities of ﬁnance and accounting is to keep
accurate and timely transaction records of all revenue and expenses
(remember your checking account transactions). The second primary
responsibility is to provide ﬁnancial management and analysis reports,

90

Rightsizing Inventory
which can be used by our stakeholders, management, banks, and various
government, tax, and law-compliancy agencies. We are the company
scorekeepers; we watch the money and, in general, oversee the health
and wealth of the company. We are sometimes called “bean counters” or
“number crunchers,” but we do much more than that.
Keep in mind that the numbers don’t tell the whole story. There are
outside factors such as the economy, changing customer requirements, new
regulations, competitive strategy, and new emerging technologies. All these
factors and others will impact how we analyze and use the numbers. Finance
and accounting operates in a structured, formal manner that complies with
good Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP). The numbers can
be presented to make the company look good or look bad in any given
year, but in all cases the numbers must be presented in a legal way.
In recent years, there has been a lot of press about companies pre-
senting the numbers in a less-than-proper way. Company executives have
been brought up on legal charges because of improper representation of
the numbers. We must always strive to do it right and follow the laws
and regulations, regardless of how bad the numbers may be. We are
responsible for managerial accounting and ﬁnancial accounting.
Managerial accounting is providing the internal supply-chain links with
ﬁnancial information that will help them make intelligent decisions in their
area of responsibility. Financial accounting is providing external supply-
chain links with information about the company’s ﬁnancial health — past,
present, and future.
TIP #32: Financial documents must be prepared in accor-
dance with all laws and regulations, regardless of how bad
they may make the company look. Inventory is a major
component of ﬁnancial reporting and must be presented
as accurately as possible.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)
Having said all that, there are two primary ﬁnancial documents we
use, and inventory is an important component in both. At present, we do
not have balance sheets and income statements for each division. It would
be great if we did, but we are not there yet.
Inventory and the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is a ﬁnancial picture of the business at a given point
of time. It lists the company’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. Assets

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

91
must always equal liabilities and owner’s equity. That’s why it’s called a
balance sheet. It answers the question of “What is our ﬁnancial position
at this point in time?” Table 3.2 is an example of a balance sheet; it was
discussed earlier by Arnie.
Anything we own that has ﬁnancial value is considered an asset. In
our case assets are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and
company-owned facilities (including land), machinery, and other invest-
ments. Assets are classiﬁed as current assets or ﬁxed assets. Current assets
are assets that are expected to be converted into cash during a normal
business cycle, generally within a ﬁscal year. Fixed assets are assets with
a useful life of a year or more.
Inventory as an Asset
Examples of current assets are inventory of raw materials, work-in-progress
(WIP), and ﬁnished goods, which we expect (hopefully) to turn into cash
over the next 12 months. That new deburring machine we bought at the
end of last year is considered a ﬁxed asset, and we expect it to have a
useful life of ﬁve years. Inventory is also referred to as a “tangible” current
asset (it can be physically touched). There are different methods used for
inventory valuation. Depending on the method chosen, the inventory asset
can be reported as having either a higher or lower valuation. I’ll discuss
this in more detail later.

Rightsizing Inventory
Among the assets reported on the balance sheet are cash, accounts
receivable, and inventory. The whole idea is to turn inventory into cash
so that money is freed up for other things, including buying more
inventory. Don’t forget the personal checking account analogy I spoke of
earlier. So, if you look at our $39 million tied up in inventory, and let’s
say, for example, we reduce it to $19 million, we would have $20 million
moved to accounts receivable, which becomes cash when the customers
pay for it. Think of what we could do with $20 million. Cash is a great asset.
Inventory as a Liability
Raw material inventory that is purchased and received into our warehouse
and is not yet paid for is recorded as an accounts payable on our balance
sheet until the invoice is paid. For example, if we bought $20,000 worth
of raw material from a supplier and we didn’t pay for it yet, it would be
entered as a current asset valued at $20,000 on the balance sheet. It would
also be entered as a (accounts payable) current liability of $20,000 on the
balance sheet. Thus, the asset and liability are in “balance.”
Unfortunately, it is not as simple as I’ve just stated. Let’s say you took
$5,000 of the raw material and used it in production to make a ﬁnished-
product. Then raw material inventory would be reduced by $5,000 and
ﬁnished goods inventory would be increased by $5,000 plus the value-
added content (labor), which, along with other parts, turns the $5,000
into, let’s say $10,000. In other words, inventory doesn’t remain stagnant
in one category on the balance sheet. Hopefully, it moves from a raw
material to WIP and, ﬁnally, to a ﬁnished product. Once it enters produc-
tion and gets combined with other raw materials, it quickly loses its unique
identity as a raw material. That’s why from a balance sheet point of view,
we look at the total aggregate value of assets and liabilities, but the
transaction or audit records will keep track of the individual items in
detail. The record keeping system that keeps track of these assets and
liabilities is called the general ledger of accounts (the checking account
analogy), and all ﬁnancial transactions are recorded there. Many people,
including our bankers, look at the balance sheet.
Financial Measurements
Two particular ﬁnancial measurements related to inventory are important.
They are the current ratio and the quick ratio. The current ratio
measures a company’s current assets against its current liabilities. Current
assets are those assets that can be converted into cash in less than a year,
and typically include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Current

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

93
liabilities are liabilities that have to be paid off in less than a year, and
typically include accounts payable and short-term loans. The formula for
the current ratio is as follows:
Current ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities
Let’s take our numbers and apply them to the current ratio formula.
At the end of the year we had $40 million in inventory, $5 million in
cash, and $25 million in accounts receivable. Our current liabilities at the
time were $25 million. So our current ratio was as follows:
$70M/$25M = 2.8
Is the ratio of 2.8 too high, or is it too low? It depends on how you look
at it. It is too low when the ratio approaches 1.0. When it gets close to
one, we will barely be able to cover our liabilities, and it will raise a ﬂag
with our bank who lends us money against an established line of credit.
If the ratio were too high, it might suggest that we were sitting on too
much cash when we could have reinvested it in the company. So our
current ratio of 2.8 is on the low side, but the good news is that it has
been trending upward for the last two quarters. You might look at this
and say we are in good shape — not great but good. This is where the
quick ratio and inventory levels impact the current ratio. The quick ratio,
also known as the acid-test ratio, is similar to the current ratio, except
we subtract inventory from the equation. The formula is as follows:
Quick ratio = Current assets – inventory/Current liabilities
As everyone in this room knows, our inventory at the end of the year
was $40 million. So, applying the quick ratio formula, we have a quick
ratio of
$70M – $40M/$25M = 1.2
Now that’s scary! As I said before, a quick ratio approaching 1 is
trouble. This supports my earlier statement that we will soon run out of
cash unless we sell off some of this inventory. The quick ratio clearly
shows the impact that inventory has on our ability to pay our bills. Let’s
look at one more measurement before we leave this section: total asset
turnover. This ratio compares total assets to revenue. Remember, revenue
is income from sales. Total assets include current assets as well as ﬁxed
assets. Total assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property,

94

Rightsizing Inventory
plant, and equipment (PPE), and other long-term assets. The formula for
total asset turnover is:
Total asset turnover = Revenue/Total assets
Applying this formula to Woodstock, our total asset turnover is:
$90M/$85M = 1.05
Again, this is another ﬁnancial measurement that tells us we are doing
poorly. Oh, by the way, the $85 million of total assets is made up of $70
million of current assets and $15 million of ﬁxed assets (PPE). Total asset
turnover is a gauge of efﬁciency in the use of all assets. If we can reduce
inventory as we must, then the total asset turnover will rise. These are
useful tools in evaluating our company’s performance. You can now
understand how important it is for us to reduce inventory days of supply
and increase inventory turns. Inventory levels have a major impact on the
ﬁnancial health of the company. Two more performance measures used
to analyze the ﬁnancial health of a company are the return on total assets
and the return on inventory investment. Because we lost $2 million last
year, it is not a pretty picture:
Return on total assets = Net annual proﬁt/Total assets
–2M/$85M = –2.35% ROA
Return on inventory investment =
Net annual proﬁt/Average inventory
–$2M/$35M = –5.71% ROII
TIP #33: Inventory moves into our ﬁnancial reporting
system as an asset on our balance sheet and remains there
until it is shipped and billed to a customer (accounts
receivable) or disposed of in some form or another.
TIP #34: Inventory also moves into our ﬁnancial reporting
system as a liability (if we didn’t pay for it yet) as part of
the accounts payable on our balance sheet and remains
there until it is paid for.
We shouldn’t leave the topic of inventory liabilities without discussing
how raw material suppliers get paid. When raw materials are purchased,

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

95
a purchase order is created. We may or may not send a hard copy of the
purchase order to the supplier. That depends on our relationship with a
particular supplier. When the raw material is received, it is recorded into
inventory, and an inventory receipt transaction is created by the receiving
department. Finally, the supplier sends us an invoice for the raw material
shipped. Before a supplier is paid, we do what is called a three-way
match. As depicted in Figure 3.1, we match up the purchase order, the
shipment receipt, and the invoice.
If all three documents are in agreement, we pay the supplier according
to the terms on the invoice. We would like to get away from doing all
this extra work. Companies today are eliminating this three-way match
with some suppliers. If we have a true “trusting” relationship with our
suppliers, we can do this also. The three-way match can also be done
electronically. Although this may not directly help us “rightsize” our
inventory, it will help us reduce our cost of doing business. At present
we have two people who spend about 50 percent of their time performing
the three-way match. At current salaries, this is costing us in excess of
$50,000 per year.
Inventory and the Income Statement
Inventory will remain on our balance sheet as an asset until it is converted
(transformed) into a ﬁnished product and sold to a customer. Once sold,
the inventory moves to the income statement, sometimes referred to as
proﬁt and loss statement. The income statement reports revenues,
expenses, and proﬁts for a given period of time. This can be prepared
monthly, quarterly, and annually.
We at Woodstock prepare a monthly income statement. Expenses are
subtracted from revenue (income) and the result is the proﬁt. Expenses
fall into many categories and, in general, include all costs to run the
business. Getting back to inventory sold, keep in mind that a ﬁnished
product is deﬁned differently for each of our divisions. For the Flashlight
Division, a ﬁnished product is a ﬂashlight, complete with batteries. For

Rightsizing Inventory
our Spotlight Division, a ﬁnished product is a subassembly that the buyer
will add to its product. For the Beacon Light Division, it could be a raw
material (component or part) or a subassembly sold by our ﬁeld service
group, or a complete light system sold by our sales team.
Once the product is sold, it moves off the balance sheet onto the
income statement as one of the three elements of cost of goods sold
(COGS). Table 3.3 represents a ﬁnancial presentation on an income
statement. COGS is used to measure all the costs directly associated with
making the products: materials, labor, and associated overhead. We all
understand the material and labor portion of COGS.
It should be mentioned that overhead in our case includes the salaries
of the planning, purchasing, and process design departments. Overhead
even includes Joe’s salary as vice president of operations. COGS is stated
a little differently for retailers and distributors (wholesalers). These types
of companies don’t produce a product. They buy a product and then
resell it at a higher price, often repackaging it. In addition to the item
cost, their COGS may include freight transportation and repacking
expenses. Getting back to Woodstock, we have to be careful how we
report inventory in our ﬁnancial statements.
Producing more than we sell can increase our proﬁt picture — but
did we really make a proﬁt? The excess inventory (more production than
what was sold) and its associated product costs are reported as an asset
on the balance sheet, rather than as COGS on the income statement (until
it is sold). Thus, it is recorded as a positive number (asset), rather than
a negative number (expense). In a sense, these ﬁxed costs will be part
of the asset account and don’t show up as an expense until they move
to the income statement as part of COGS expense. This can lead to a
misrepresentation of proﬁt. No one should deliberately overproduce inven-
tory for favorable accounting and reporting of an asset. Remember, sooner
or later, that asset will have to be reported as an expense (when sold)

on the income statement. It may make the company’s ﬁnancials look good
in one accounting period but bad in another. Let’s get back to your
personal checking account as an example. Suppose you deposited your
salary checks into your checking account for a whole month and didn’t
write out any checks to pay bills. Well, someone could look at your
account balance (asset) and assume you were in good ﬁnancial shape.
However, the next month you write checks to pay all your bills and you
run out of money. You were only kidding yourself and didn’t fool anyone.
Figure 3.2 shows a breakdown of our COGS.
Our COGS for last year was $60 million: far too high for a company
our size. Arnie probably already mentioned it, but I’ll restate it in case
you forgot. How slowly or how quickly inventory ﬂows through our
supply chain is an important aspect of rightsizing our inventory. If you
look at the quick ratio cited earlier, we have to pick up the pace and
move inventory out more quickly. The faster we move it, the sooner we
will get the cash and improve this ratio. What I’m really saying is, we
have to increase our inventory turns. Based on our average inventory and
cost of goods sold, we turned our total inventory 1.7 times.
The formula is:
Inventory turns = COGS/average inventory
$60M/$35M = 1.7 turns
Inventory turns can also be calculated as:
Sales/inventory = Inventory turns
However, using sales rather than COGS can overstate the inventory turn-
over ratio, because the sales ﬁgure exceeds costs by the gross margin.

Rightsizing Inventory
Let’s use the COGS/inventory formula, take this a step further, and calculate
“inventory days on hand.”
The formula is:
Days of supply = Days of the year/inventory turns
365/1.7 = 215 days of supply
From a ﬁnancial point of view, this is not a good ratio. I realize, to
you in operations, it has little meaning, because we have three divisions
and multiple categories of inventory. Is this a true picture of our days of
supply? I’ve done a little experimenting and estimating and have come
up with some interesting numbers. I realized that our average inventory
was $35 million throughout the year, and our year-end inventory was $40
million. Because we have no supporting data on the average inventory
by division, I will use the year-end inventory to make a point.
There are several assumptions I used to come up with my numbers.
I assumed COGS was related to sales by division. Let’s take the Flashlight
Division because that’s our largest division. Total COGS for the company
was $60 million, and sales for the Flashlight Division were 67 percent of
all sales, as shown in Figure 3.3.
I assumed (arguably) that this corresponded to 67 percent of COGS,
which represented $40.2 million in COGS for this division. Assuming the
total year-end inventory for the Flashlight Division was $28 million (actual,
not average) and COGS was $40.2 million, I applied the formula and
came up with the following inventory turns for this division:
Figure 3.3

Spotlight division
$20,000,000

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

99
$40.2/28 = 1.4 turns per year
Taking this a step further, I calculated the days on hand and came up
with the number of day’s inventory on hand for this division:
365/1.4 = 261 days of inventory on hand
Now let’s look only at the Flashlight Division ﬁnished goods inventory
and apply the same two formulas:
$40.2/$13 = 3.09 turns per year
365/3.09 = 118 days of inventory on hand
Now you might be wondering why I went through this mental exercise.
We in ﬁnance look at the aggregate inventory and the aggregate inventory
turns. From our point of view, we view low inventory turns as a sign
that our cash-to-cash cycle (I’ll explain later) is very poor, and overall
inventory turns have to increase. You in operations, on the other hand,
need to understand the details so that you can focus on areas where
inventory turns are the lowest. If you compare our total company inven-
tory turns and inventory days on hand to the Flashlight Division inventory
turns and days on hand, you get a clearer picture of inventory turns and
days on hand:
All inventory:
1.7 turns and 215 days of supply (100 percent COGS)
All ﬂashlight inventory:
1.4 turns and 261 days of supply (67 percent COGS)
All ﬂashlight ﬁnished goods inventory:
3.09 turns and 118 days of supply (67 percent COGS)
This approach gives us a more realistic picture of where we need to
focus our attention. The average 215 days of supply for all inventory is
a lot different when you compare it to the 118 days of supply for the
ﬁnished goods, ﬂashlights. However, we still need to dig into the details.
In theory, 215 days of inventory means it takes 215 days for inventory to
ﬂow through our supply chain. In the aggregate, this tells us the big
picture, but in reality, some inventory moves through our supply chains
in days, and some inventory has been sitting here for years.

100

Rightsizing Inventory
Having the numbers is a good thing, and it certainly gives us a
benchmark to measure against, but we still have to manage the inventory
at the item-level detail. As I said before, my numbers are off because I
couldn’t come up with realistic average inventory numbers by division.
I’m merely trying to show you that if we can track COGS and average
inventory throughout the year by division, inventory turns and days of
supply will have more meaning to operations. If the numbers have more
meaning, it will help in our efforts to rightsize our inventory.
TIP #35: Finance looks at inventory turns and days of
supply in the aggregate, but for operations to address this
issue in its inventory rightsizing efforts, inventory turns,
days of supply, and COGS need to be broken down into
inventory types and families at the item-level detail.
I would like to make two more points before I leave this subject. You
might be wondering why I used 365 days to calculate days of supply
rather than just the 250 days or so that we normally work. The answer
is that we are paying for and carrying that inventory every day of the
year, whether we are open for business or not.
The other point I want to make is, when we look at COGS, we need
to understand that inventory represents the greatest portion of that cost.
Figure 3.2 shows 55 percent of COGS is for material, by far the highest
cost, representing $33 million last year. Inventory levels and costs are the
single biggest cash outﬂow we have, and it must be addressed and
reduced, if we want to stay in business.
Inventory Carrying Cost
I started out by saying that having inventory costs the company money.
So far we have learned that low inventory turns and high inventory days
of supply are a drain on cash ﬂow and cost us money. We also learned
that inventory is the largest element of COGS, again, costing us a lot of
money. Let’s move on to a third area where having inventory is costing
us money: carrying cost. My Uncle Billy, who was chairman of the board
of our family business where I worked as controller before joining Wood-
stock, once told me that carrying cost is a meaningless inventory metric.
His argument was that we still had to pay for the space, people, insurance,
etc., regardless of our inventory level. We argued about this all the time.
Let me share with you my thoughts on this topic. First of all, “carrying
costs” can be deﬁned as those costs associated with holding inventory in
stock. This is usually deﬁned as a percentage of the dollar value of the

total inventory. This cost can vary from company to company, anywhere
from 10 percent to 40 percent annually. What’s important to understand
here (and my uncle didn’t get it) is whether we could get a better return
on our investment if we spent the money elsewhere, rather than on
inventory in our supply chain. Let me state the obvious: inventory costs
money. It costs us money to buy it and look after it. Because most
companies are not cash rich, they borrow money from the bank to do
this. Thus, money costs money.
We pay interest on borrowed money, and we draw from a line of
credit we have established with our bank. This money or line of credit
might be best spent elsewhere, like buying newer, efﬁcient machines that
will improve our productivity and reduce the need to carry so much
inventory. Carrying cost is not a one-time expense. It is an ongoing cost
of doing business. Our carrying costs at Woodstock are 25 percent of the
total value of our inventory. Our year-end inventory was $40 million. So,
our carrying costs last year were
$40M × .25 = $10 million
It cost us $10 million last year to carry that $40 million. If we had invested
that $10 million somewhere else, would we have a better return? That’s
the question. Keep in mind that this isn’t a one-time cost. For every year
we carry this $40 million, it will cost us $10 million to carry it. That’s a
great deal of money! What are some of these costs? There are three
categories of carrying costs. Let’s discuss them.
1.
Storage costs: These costs can vary signiﬁcantly, depending on
your type of business and the value and size of your inventory.
This cost category includes the cost for space, people, systems,
and the equipment to move goods into and out of inventory. For
example, if your product is a high-end watch brand well known
as a piece of jewelry rather than a functional watch that you throw
away when the battery goes dead ﬁve years later, your storage
costs will be different.
Let’s refer to the high-end watch company as company A and
the low-end watch company as company B. Which company would
have a higher storage cost? If you guessed company A, you would
be right. Company A’s warehouse space might be a safe the size
of a room where the watches are kept. It will spend more money
on security systems and security guards. The procedures for entering
and leaving a secured area might be complex and time consuming
— and we all know that time is money. Let’s say that you are a
well-known manufacturer of high fashion designer briefcases and

102


handbags. Which would require a more rigid inventory control
system, the raw material or the ﬁnished product? In this example
it would be the ﬁnished product. So you see, the value of the
product is an important factor when we talk about space. The
equipment cost is another part of the carrying cost. This will vary
depending on the physical characteristics of the product and how
your storeroom is laid out. In our case, the value of our products
is a lesser issue than the cost of equipment and personnel.
Our storeroom shelves are over 20 feet high and we require
forklift trucks that get to the top shelf. These forklift trucks require
operators, and our maintenance department has to keep the equip-
ment in running order. All this is part of the storage cost. We are
lucky that our products don’t require refrigeration, like some indus-
tries; this would add to the storage cost. The batteries we stock
are in a climate-controlled room, which does add some to our
storage cost. Even the computer system can be considered as part
of our carrying cost. This would include the hardware, such as
PCs, bar-code readers, and scanners, and software, such as our
warehouse management system.
2.
Capital costs: This portion of carrying cost is the amount of money
we have tied up in inventory. We all know that our inventory is
about $39 million. We had to borrow a good portion of this to
pay for the raw materials and labor to make the ﬁnished products.
As a result of this, we have to pay interest on the loans (line of
credit) we have with our bank. Some of these short-term loans are
coming due soon, and we will have a substantial payment due by
the end of June. We will need to turn a lot of inventory into cash
by then. It won’t do us any good to move out $20 million worth
of inventory if we are just going to replace it. We have to move
it out and keep it out.
3.
Risk costs: There is a degree of risk with carrying inventory. It
can become obsolete, damaged, or we could have a pilferage
problem. We have insurance to protect us against these risks, but
the insurance cost is another cost we incur in carrying inventory.
We need to look at this in more detail. The reasons that inventory
becomes obsolete vary from company to company. Here are a few
we should look at:

No market demand: The inventory is at the end of its life
cycle, and the customers no longer want to buy it. I think we
should look at any inventory item that hasn’t had any activity
for one year or more, consider disposing of it, and write it off
our books.

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

103

Defective inventory: Any inventory item that is damaged and
cannot be repaired should be scrapped or recycled. I’m no
chemist, but I do know we use a lot of plastic parts. Let’s do
an analysis of our damaged parts and see if it is possible to
sell them to a recycling company. Rather than a total write-off,
we would get some residual return and at the same time be
environmentally conscious.

Technical obsolescence: Some of our products may be tech-
nically obsolete. Let’s have our sales teams review the ﬁnished
goods inventory to identify products that have reached the end
of their life cycle and see how we can move them out of
inventory. The same is true for our raw materials. Let’s have
our product design team review the raw material inventory.

Design (engineering) changes: I have been at meetings
where our design team said it found a different part or com-
ponent that would be better suited to our ﬁnished product.
What about the inventory of the part that was r eplaced?
Shouldn’t we be looking for ways to work this inventory off?

Spoilage: Fortunately, we don’t have this problem, or do we?
The only products that might be an issue are batteries. But I
doubt it. Batteries today have a long shelf life, and unless some
inventory fell through the cracks, I don’t think this will be a
big-ticket item for us.
Does anyone here know how much of our inventory is obsolete? I
know there is a reluctance to admit that we have obsolete inventory. No
one wants to see a large inventory write-off on our ﬁnancial records. But
truth be told, we are losing money and need cash to keep operating. If
there is any way that we can move some of this obsolete inventory off
the books and get cash for it, we should do it; we will be doing a good
thing for the company.
As I said earlier, let’s take our loss now rather than later. This needs
to be explained to the sales team. Its immediate reaction will be to say
“no.” The team will want to keep the inventory “just in case” it gets an
order for it. Another typical reaction will be, “the minute we get rid of
the inventory, a customer will give us an order for it.” My answer to that
is, if the team gets an order for it after we scrap it, then we will make
it. I have run a report indicating all inventory items where there has been
no activity for 12 months or longer. This includes raw materials and
ﬁnished goods. The oldest item is a raw material, part number 31918. We
have 5000 of these (lenses) in stock, and the total value is $1000. Now
you may say that $1000 isn’t much, but Table 3.4 shows the complete list

104

Rightsizing Inventory
of inactive items. This list shows that we have close to $6 million of
inventory with no activity for a year or longer.
You want to rightsize our inventory, right? Well, this is a great place
to start. I recommend that the Harmony Team study this in detail. I think
you will be surprised by your ﬁndings. Here is a good way to look at it.
We live in the northeastern part of the country and experience the four
seasons of weather change. Typically, we go through our wardrobe each
time the season changes and get out the appropriate clothing for that
season. My husband is the type who doesn’t like to throw out anything.
He will keep rotating the same clothes year after year, even though he
may not have worn it for ﬁve years! He keeps saying that he will go on
a diet and ﬁt into it some day. I’m just the opposite. I say, if I haven’t
worn it for this season, then get rid of it. That’s the mentality we have
to apply to our inventory here at Woodstock.
TIP #36: Analyze your inventory for activity. If there hasn’t
been any activity on an item in inventory for 12 months
or longer, consider disposing of it. This includes raw mate-
rials and ﬁnished goods.
TIP #37: There is a direct relationship between the level
of inventory carried, and the cost of carrying inventory.
When the inventory level increases, carrying cost
increases; when the inventory level decreases, carrying
cost decreases.
Inventory Valuation
One major accounting decision we in ﬁnance have to make is how to
measure the value of our inventory. As I’ve stated earlier, inventory remains
on the balance sheet as an asset until it is sold and then moves to the
income statement as part of COGS. The amount of this expense (COGS)

depends on the accounting method we use. Likewise, the inventory value
that still remains on the balance sheet as an asset depends on the
accounting method used also. There are two popular inventory valuation
methods used today: ﬁrst in–ﬁrst out (FIFO) cost sequence and last in–ﬁrst
out (LIFO) cost sequence. There are other methods, which I’ll discuss later.
LIFO and FIFO seem to be the most popular. Item costs are entered
into the inventory asset account in the order acquired, but they do not
have to be taken out of the inventory asset account in the same order.
The different methods address the order in which item costs are taken
out of the inventory asset account but have nothing to do with the physical
act of moving inventory into and out of stock. For example, if you bought
500 pieces of raw material A in January and 200 pieces in February, you
don’t have to physically use up the January material before using the
February material. These techniques only address how you record the
value of inventory movement, not the physical movement itself.
The FIFO Inventory Valuation Method
With the FIFO method, you charge out the item cost to COGS expense
in the order in which you acquire the goods. Let’s use light housing frame
part number 5867 as an example. Suppose we bought this part as follows:
January: 100 pieces at $25 each; February: 100 pieces at $30 each; and
March: 100 pieces at $35 each. The total cost for the quarter is shown in
Table 3.5.
For the quarter, we use 250 pieces and follow the FIFO inventory
valuation method. Inventory expense would be $7250 (recorded on the
income statement as part of COGS); the remaining 50 pieces would go
into inventory at $35 each for a total of $1750 (recorded on the balance
sheet).
The inventory asset account on the balance sheet and the COGS
expense on the income statement are in balance, and all is right with the
accounting world. FIFO is an ideal method for several reasons. The actual
physical movement of goods typically, but not always, is on a ﬁrst in
–ﬁrst out basis and matches the accounting method rather nicely. In this
way, the ending inventory, 50 pieces in my example, reﬂects the most
recent purchase cost and, therefore, is very close to the replacement of
this item (currently $36 each).
When item costs are rising, as in my example, companies try to follow
a ﬁrst in–ﬁrst out sales price strategy. That way they try to hold off a
price increase a bit longer. They might wait until they have sold off all
the lower cost inventory (January and February) before raising prices. On
the other hand, they might want to raise sales prices before reaching the
higher-priced goods so that they can make greater proﬁt margins.

107
The LIFO Inventory Valuation Method
With this inventory valuation method, you charge out inventory based
on the last item you purchased ﬁrst and then work backward until you
have the total cost for the number of items sold. Using this method,
inventory expense would be charged as shown in Table 3.5. You will
note, using the LIFO method, inventory is recorded at $500, which is
lower than when using the FIFO method, and COGS is recorded at $500,
which is higher than when using the FIFO method. In this example,
using the LIFO method will result in higher cost. The remaining inventory
will have a lower valuation, but will be further apart from a realistic
replacement cost. So that’s the trade-off: inventory (asset) valuation versus
COGS (expense) valuation.
TIP #38: Select an inventory valuation method that best
reﬂects the true value of your inventory and conforms to
GAAP guidelines.
When inventory costs are rising, the LIFO method maximizes your
COGS expense deduction for determining taxable income and will help
minimize taxable income. By taking out product cost and charging it to
COGS expense, you minimize the inventory cost value. The pitfall in doing
this is that your inventory cost value can very quickly become out-of-
date, especially in our business where our products have very long shelf
lives. If inventory items have a very short life cycle, then the gap between
LIFO and FIFO will be less and the accounting method will not have as
great an impact. However, we only get to use one method of inventory
valuation at a time.
We have been using the FIFO method here at Woodstock, and we
have no plans to change it right now. If we switched to the LIFO method,
we could reduce the value of our inventory substantially, but it would be
misleading. It would not reﬂect the true replacement value of our inven-
tory. However, we found some cases where our current inventory value
is higher than the current product replacement cost. For a few items, it
is even higher than our selling price. I am going to recommend to Adriana
that we decrease our product cost to the lower of the two, so that we
recognize our inventory loss now, rather than when the product is sold.
TIP #39: Inventory valuation must be realistic and reﬂect
the true value of your inventory. Consider adjusting the
value of your inventory downward if it falls below the
current replacement cost or the current selling price of
the product. Take the loss earlier rather than later.

108

Rightsizing Inventory
Besides LIFO and FIFO, which are the two most popular inventory
valuation techniques, there are other cost techniques and considerations:
Average Cost Valuation Method
The average cost method averages the acquisition cost of a material over
a period of time. This provides some balance between COGS expense on
the income statement and the inventory asset on the balance sheet. If we
don’t want to go with LIFO or FIFO, this is a method we should consider.
Standard Cost Valuation Method
Using the standard cost technique, a single value (standard) is selected
for an inventory item, typically for a period of one year. This standard is
based on some average of past usage and estimated future cost. Companies
then compare this standard cost to actual costs and report the difference
as an inventory variance from standard.
Actual Cost Valuation Method
This method attempts to capture actual inventory costs as they occur.
For raw materials this is relatively straightforward. However, if you
manufacture sub-assemblies like we do, it becomes a more difﬁcult
process. Once we take a raw material and add some value to it (labor
and overhead), we would have to capture the new value when it is put
into inventory. Some industries use this method when inventory is tied
to a particular contract.
Activity-Based Costing Method
This method focuses on the activities that create cost, sometimes referred
to as “cost drivers.” This approach attempts to assign costs directly to
speciﬁc products rather than assigning costs across the board to a broad
range of products. Unless you have the capability to capture and assign
these costs, this is a difﬁcult technique to implement. We aren’t there yet,
but I would like to do this someday.
Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) Inventory Valuation
Inventory valuation methods are subject to the LCM rule. This means that
if your inventory depreciates in value, you must write your inventory

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

109
down to the depreciated value. There can be many reasons why an item
decreases in value rather than appreciates. Damaged goods are a good
example. If inventory is damaged, it may not be worth what you paid
for it, so you can’t charge full price. In this case, we estimate how much
we can receive for the item and create an allowance for the change. In
other words, we would write down the inventory value to the net
realizable value. As part of our inventory rightsizing efforts, we should
analyze our inventory for the LCM and make the necessary adjustments
and allowances.
Market Valuation
Inventory is typically valued at cost or market, whichever is lower. Yes,
there are situations where market value can be less than cost. This loss
in market value can be a result of market forces related to supply and
demand. Depending on how we measure our market, a decline in market
value will have different effects on our inventory valuations and income
calculations. For example, let’s look at one particular product, spotlight
subassembly part #52969, as shown in Table 3.6.
Net Realizable Value Less Proﬁt Margin
Any reduction in selling price will reduce the value of the inventory. In
this example, any selling price below $60 will not cover the selling cost
of $15, the proﬁt margin of $15, and the product cost of $30. If we actually
sell the product for $55, we will only recover $25 of the $30 product cost.
The reduction in inventory value will reduce income by the equivalent
amount in the current period. It allows the company to cover its selling
cost and show a normal margin when the inventory is sold at another time.

Rightsizing Inventory
Net Realizable Value
A decrease in selling price in excess of proﬁt margin will reduce the value
of inventory, but a decrease in selling price of less than the proﬁt margin
will not. Any loss in proﬁt margin will occur in the future when the
inventory is sold. There is a reduction of inventory value and income in
the current period if selling price fails to cover product and selling costs.
Inventory Replacement Cost
Market value can be deﬁned as replacement or reproduction cost, with
limits based on selling price. A decrease in inventory replacement cost
will reduce the value of inventory and the income for the current period.
Future income will be increased as the lower cost inventory is sold. Market
cannot be more than net realizable value. An inventory item for sale
cannot be worth less than its current price, less the cost of selling it and
providing a normal proﬁt.
Variable Costing
Some companies like to value inventory at variable cost and assign all
ﬁxed costs as period costs. This is known as variable costing or direct
costing. This practice of assigning ﬁxed costs to inventory is called absorp-
tion costing. This can sometimes be misleading and may cause the com-
pany to produce at full capacity when customer demand isn’t there,
because inventory is absorbing ﬁxed costs. This is based on the concept
“the more we produce, the more ﬁxed cost we will cover.” Although this
might be a useful tool for ﬁnancial analysis, I’m not sure it is an acceptable
technique for income and asset management measurements.
Manufacturing Cost Accounting
Another area we are responsible for is product cost accounting. This
activity is where we try to capture all the costs associated with a product,
and come up with a total cost for the product. This is an important activity
because once the total cost of a product is known, the sales and marketing
team can establish a selling price that meets the company criteria for proﬁt
margins. We had a product in our Spotlight Division not long ago that
we really messed up on. We estimated our cost to be $24.50 per unit,
and sales priced it at $42.50. The books showed that we were making a
gross proﬁt of $10 per unit sold. We came to ﬁnd out that we used the
wrong labor rate in the assembly work center. After we made the adjust-

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

111
ment, our cost ballooned to $37.95 per unit and our gross proﬁt dropped
to $4.55 per unit. After deducting all other business costs such as sales
and administrative expenses, we discovered we were actually losing $3.95
per unit. Here’s the real impact. We had already sold 2,698 of those units,
so we actually lost $10,657.10. To make matters worse, sales was com-
mitted to that selling price and couldn’t change it for the rest of the year.
We lost $50,756 for the year on that product. We must be sure that we
are assigning the correct costs to our products.
TIP #40: Cost accounting must capture the true cost of
adding value to a raw material, so that ﬁnished goods
are valued correctly for sales and marketing to establish
selling prices that conform to company proﬁtability
guidelines.
We in ﬁnance and accounting shouldn’t be doing this alone. We have
a cost accountant on staff who does this, but he should be working with
all the links in our supply chain to get the true cost. The two groups that
should be heavily involved are product design for input on the materials
used and process design for the labor required to put the product together.
Even purchasing should be involved. After all, purchasing goes out and
buys the materials. I know you are looking at getting all of our supply-
chain links to work together. This is one more area that the Harmony
Team should look at. Figure 3.4 shows a typical bill of material for one
of our subassemblies.

Rightsizing Inventory
What we attempt to do in cost accounting is to assign material, labor,
and overhead costs at each level in the bill of material and then roll up
those costs to the ﬁnished product. This particular part is a subassembly
that we ship to our customers, who then use our product to manufacture
their product. Because this product has a lot of glass and other fragile
components, we have to package it carefully. In addition to the manu-
facturing cost, we even capture the labor (time required to pack it) and
material (carton, tape, inserts, bubble wrap, and peanuts) to pack it safely
so that it doesn’t get damaged in transit. Figure 3.4 shows the material
cost for subassembly #092152. For example, subassembly A is a manu-
factured part that goes into subassembly #092152. It is made up of
purchased materials S and E. The purchase cost of material S is $5, and
of material E is $6. Therefore, the total material cost for part A is $11.
Likewise, the material costs of X ($9), N ($3), and Y ($5) are added
up, and the material cost for part C becomes $17. Going up the bill of
material, we add the material costs of A ($11.00), B ($4.00), and C ($17.00)
and the total material cost (without labor and overhead) is $32.00. Now
we need to add labor to parts A, C, and subassembly #092152, as shown
in Figure 3.5.
Because parts S, E, X, N, Y, and B are purchased parts, no labor is
added. It requires $1.65 of labor to manufacture part A, using purchased
parts S and E. It also requires $2.55 of labor to manufacture part C from
purchased parts X, N, and Y. It further requires $4.80 of labor to assemble
parts A, B, and C. So, for part A, the cost of material and labor becomes

$12.65 (M = $11.00 + L = $1.65) and the cost of C becomes $19.55 (M =
$17.00 + L = $2.55). The cost to assemble parts A, B, and C into
subassembly #092152 is $4.80, for a total material and labor cost of $41.00
(A = $12.65 + B = $4.00 + C = $19.55 + L = $4.80).
In many cases, we are paying for the labor six months or more before
the product is shipped to a customer. Then we have to wait another 30
to 60 days before the customer pays us. This hurts our cash ﬂow. If we
could keep the raw material in stock and add the labor further downstream
in our manufacturing process, we would improve our cash ﬂow. Granted,
we have to pay labor anyway, but why not have them working on products
that are going out the door immediately?
TIP #41: As a raw material moves through the manufac-
turing process, labor adds value and increases the cost of
the item. If the item goes back into inventory, it goes back
at a higher cost, thus increasing the total value of the
inventory. If possible, delay adding value to a raw material
until it can be shipped without going back into inventory.
Inventory Accuracy
How can a ﬁnancial person conclude an inventory presentation without
discussing inventory accuracy? You know, every December is a time of
the year we ﬁnancial types dread. You would think, with the holiday
season and all, it would be a happy time of the year for everyone. On a
personal level it is, but on a business level it is a nightmare. Why? Because
that is the time of the year when we take physical inventory. This process
takes weeks to accomplish. We take one week preparing for it, another
week to take the inventory, and then another two weeks to reconcile the
inventory with our perpetual records. This is a total of four weeks. What
is disheartening is the fact that, come January of the new year, it takes
only about two weeks for it to get out of sync.
Every year we go through the same routine, and every year two weeks
later, we are back where we were. I wonder why we bother. Actually,
we have to do it. Our outside accountants and auditors require us to do
it. We in ﬁnance take all the item counts and roll all this data up into an
aggregate number that we use in our ﬁnancial reporting. We aren’t
concerned about individual items. I know those of you in operations are.
We are concerned with the total dollar value of the inventory, and you
are concerned with individual item counts. If you remember, our year-
ending inventory was $40 million, and our average inventory throughout
the year was $35 million.

114

Rightsizing Inventory
Our total inventory went up from the year before, and everyone was
surprised. That’s what caused Adriana to write her e-mail to Joe, and why
you are tasked with rightsizing inventory. And let me say this, we can’t
possibly rightsize our inventory unless we know what it is. Inventory
accuracy is a key criterion for successful supply chains. Inventory inac-
curacy causes all sorts of supply-chain problems — not just immediate
ﬁnancial ones. At what point can we say our inventory is accurate? Well,
the correct answer is when our physical inventory matches our perpetual
inventory 100 percent. That should be our goal.
Table 3.7 represents three different inventory items. The perpetual
inventory record says we should have 100 of each in stock. Well, we took
a physical inventory, and the physical count was: item A, 99 pieces; item
B, 100 pieces; and item C, 98 pieces. Based on this data, what is our
inventory accuracy? Pretty good, huh? Would you say about 98 percent?
Wrong. Our inventory accuracy in this example is 33 percent. Only one
out of three inventory records are correct. In the aggregate, it looks pretty
good. But what would you say if item B has a unit cost of .005 cents and
item C has a cost of $150? It’s not looking so good now. What if I said
we could buy item B (which is a standard screw size) at the local hardware
store and item A is purchased halfway around the world and has a 26-
week lead time? What if I said we needed 100 pieces of item C right now
to satisfy a major customer? Again, things look bleak. Inventory inaccuracy
causes many problems; here are a few of them:
1.
Lost sales: If you have a stockout because you don’t have an item
you thought you had in stock, you could lose a sale.
2.
Missed production schedules: You set up a machine, assign an
operator, and you are ready to go, but the material you thought
you had isn’t there.
3.
Lost capacity: Now (see item 2) you have to do another setup
on the machine and run a different product. While the machine
is down for a new setup, you are losing capacity.
4.
Excessive expediting: Someone has to spend time expediting the
part you thought you had in stock. They could have ﬁnished a
more constructive task, instead.

5.
Premium freight charges: Now you have to ask your supplier
to rush in the part, and as a result you may have to pay a freight
premium.
6.
Premium item cost: Your supplier may have to break down its
setup to rush your job, and you may have to pay more for the part.
7.
High inventory levels: You didn’t know you had it, so it just sits
there collecting dust and adding to your carrying cost.
The ﬁrst six problems of inventory inaccuracy relate to not having an
item in stock that you thought you had. The last problem relates to not
knowing you had something in stock. This is just as bad as any of the
other six for all the reasons I’ve talked about previously. Let’s get back
to deﬁning inventory accuracy. I said the inventory accuracy in this
example was 33 percent. In the real world, many companies apply a
percentage range to inventory accuracy. For example, an inventory record
may be considered accurate if it is within plus or minus 5 percent of the
perpetual inventory record. If that were the case, then the inventory
accuracy would be 100 percent (actually 99 percent). I’m not comfortable
with that and neither should you be. We will have to agree on what
constitutes inventory accuracy here at Woodstock.
TIP #42 Inventory inaccuracy has a negative impact on
the entire supply chain, can decrease customer service
and productivity levels, and can increase costs. You must
improve inventory accuracy.
TIP #43: Each company must deﬁne the criteria used to
measure inventory accuracy, measure accuracy against the
criteria, and communicate all this to all employees in the
supply chain.
Just in case you hadn’t heard, our year-end inventory was reconciled
to our perpetual inventory. Using the criterion of total dollars of the
physical inventory compared to the total dollars of the perpetual inventory,
our inventory accuracy was 88 percent. The physical inventory was $40
million, and the perpetual inventory was $35 million.
Inventory accuracy: ($35/$40M = .875)
This is not good. If you looked at the details of individual items, you
would ﬁnd that accuracy at the item level was even worse. We didn’t
measure this, but I would bet it is somewhere around 70 percent to 75
percent. We need to improve our inventory accuracy. We can do this by

116

Rightsizing Inventory
using a technique called cycle counting. Cycle counting is a methodology
of counting some inventory items every day rather than waiting for the
end of the year. The concept behind cycle counting is to catch inventory
inaccuracies immediately, rather than wait until the end of the year to
count all items. Equally important with this concept is to not only correct
the inventory record, but also ﬁnd out (and ﬁx) what is causing the
inaccuracy to occur. Our warehouse link is looking into this, and I will
let them explain to you how this works and what the plans are to improve
inventory accuracy.
Inventory ABC Classiﬁcation
Cycle counting is a great idea, and I’m glad that our warehouse folks are
looking into it. However, not all inventory items need to be counted using
this technique. For example, we use a great deal of standard size sheet
metal screws in some of our product lines. These can be purchased from
our local hardware store down the street or from one of the big chains
located on the highway about two miles from our plant. We should
categorize our inventory into groups by relative importance, with A items
having the highest importance, C items with the lowest importance, and
B items being somewhere in between.
The sheet metal screw I just mentioned should be classiﬁed as a C
item and counted less frequently. On the other hand, we have some very
expensive fabricated parts that cost in excess of $200 each. These should
be classiﬁed as A items and should be counted more frequently. One
method of categorizing our inventory might be based on annual dollar
usage. Many companies do it this way. Table 3.8 is an example of using
this technique. In Table 3.9, the data is resorted in descending dollar
value, which shows part #5 to have the highest annual dollar usage. It is
purely a coincidence that it is also the highest unit usage, also. Note that
although part #4 has the second-highest dollar annual usage, it is only
number 9 in annual unit usage.
We don’t have to do it this way. We could instead establish a different
criterion, such as long-lead-time items, difﬁcult-to-get items, or even a
high-risk supplier where we sole source.
I recommend that we classify our inventory into ABC categories and
then decide on the degree of control we will place on them. For A items,
we will have tight control and count them every month; for B items we
will count once a quarter; and for C items, only twice a year. We may
have to hire people to do this, but it will be money well spent to get our
inventory accuracy up to acceptable levels. In the long run, we will save
money. We can’t truly rightsize our inventory if we don’t know what it
is. Let’s do it. Well, that’s all I have to say for now. I hope I have provided

Rightsizing Inventory
Inter-Ofﬁce E-Mail
To: Supply-Chain Managers
February 25
From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory Level: $40.9 Million
Although the numbers don’t reﬂect it yet, we are going
in the right direction. Today we met with Pat in ﬁnance
to discuss its role and responsibility as it relates to
inventory. She did an excellent job in explaining inven-
tory from a ﬁnancial point of view. Following is a sum-
mary of some of the things we learned, along with some
action items. As usual, the detailed minutes of the
meeting will follow in another e-mail for your perusal.
If you have any questions or insights you would like to
share with the Harmony Team, please do not hesitate
to contact any one of us.
1.
We must reduce inventory immediately to improve
our cash position (which is not good).
2.
The only time we have real cash inﬂow is when our
customers pay for the inventory we ship. All other
inventory transactions effect cash outﬂow.
3.
Finance will track inventory budgets and report
monthly budget variances to all supply-chain manag-
ers.
4.
From a ﬁnancial point of view, inventory is considered
an asset on our balance sheet. It remains there until
it is sold and then moves to the income statement as
part of COGS.
5.
From an operations point of view, any inventory in
excess of immediate customer needs should be con-
sidered a liability. We should question why we have it.
6.
We learned that ﬁnance uses certain inventory ratios
to measure our ﬁnancial health. Although the current
ratio is a good tool, the quick ratio (acid test) is more
revealing and shows we are in trouble. Pat will dis-
tribute all the ﬁnancial ratios we discussed for every-
one to see on a monthly basis.


119
7.
Inventory turns are terrible, and we discussed this
before. However, Pat showed us another inventory
turns-related formula that shows we have 215 days of
inventory supply on hand. In other words, it takes us
215 days to turn over our inventory. Pat will publish
this also.
8.
On average, it costs us $10 million a year to carry
inventory at our current levels. Not only does the
inventory cost money to buy, it also costs us a lot to
carry it in stock.
9.
Pat explained the difference between LIFO and FIFO
inventory valuation methods, and she will look into
changing our GAAP reporting methodology. She
would prefer to stay with FIFO but will explore the
LIFO methodology.
10.
Finance will look at our inventory from a LCM
(explained in the minutes) point of view and, where
appropriate, will write down inventory in accordance
with GAAP principles.
11.
Finance (along with process engineering) will review
our item cost accounting details to see if adjustments
need to be made.
12.
Pat discussed inventory accuracy and deﬁned it.
Finance is concerned with the dollar accuracy and
operations is concerned with the SKU (stock keeping
unit) count. Pat estimates the dollar accuracy at 88
percent last year, and the SKU accuracy at 70 percent
to 75 percent, although she couldn’t justify the num-
bers at this time.
13.
Because different items need different degrees of
control and accuracy levels, we are going to use ABC
analysis to prioritize our inventory and establish cri-
teria for each category.
Our next meeting is scheduled for March 19 with sales
and marketing. In the meantime, we will continue to
work on the action items discussed with customer ser-
vice (Maria) and ﬁnance (Pat). Attached to this e-mail is
a continuation of our inventory rightsizing model (Fig-
ure 3.6) for your review and comments.

Rightsizing Inventory
Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
In this chapter, I have introduced 12 new TIPS and 10 formulas that can
be used for ﬁnancial performance measurements. Accounting and ﬁnancial
management are important elements of any supply chain, no matter how
large or how small. Regardless of the size of your company, you must
follow basic rules and regulations of inventory management. Certain
ﬁnancial documents must conform to GAAP.
TIP #32: Financial documents must be prepared in accor-
dance with all laws and regulations, regardless of how bad
they may make the company look. Inventory is a major
component of ﬁnancial reporting and must be presented
as accurately as possible.
Sarbanes–Oxley Act
As a result of the ﬁnancial scandals at some public corporations and lack
of corporate oversight that resulted in huge company losses, the Sarbanes
Oxley Act, sometimes referred to as SOX, was enacted by Congress in
2002. The overriding intent of SOX was to protect investors by requiring
public corporations to have better control over corporate disclosure, ﬁnan-
cial reporting, and corporate governance. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is responsible for the act and monitoring corporate

compliance. There are two key provisions of SOX that have a particular
impact on supply-chain management and inventory:
Section 401
In part, annual and quarterly ﬁnancial reports are required to be ﬁled
with the SEC. Reporting companies must disclose certain material off-
balance-sheet transactions, arrangements, and obligations (including con-
tingent obligations). Other relationships of the issuer with unconsolidated
entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect
on the ﬁnancial condition of the company must be reported. In addition,
changes in ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures, capital resources, or signiﬁcant components of revenue or
expenses must be reported.
Section 404
In part, this section of SOX requires that each annual report contain an
internal control report that shall state the responsibility of management
for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure
and procedures for ﬁnancial reporting, and also an assessment, as of the
end of the most recent ﬁscal year of the issuer. The effectiveness of the
internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for ﬁnancial report-
ing should be included.
Complying with Sections 401 and 404 of SOX goes beyond just record-
ing a series of transactions. It must be a well-deﬁned process that crosses
links in the supply chain, from buying raw materials to shipment of goods
to the customer, and all processes in between. Your service providers,
such as third-party logistics (3PL) and fourth-party logistics (4PL) compa-
nies have supply-chain responsibilities to understand and comply with
SOX requirements. SOX requires disclosure of risks and strategies that
will go into effect in the event of a disruptive event, such as hurricanes,
terrorism, or accidents.
Complying with SOX has a signiﬁcant side beneﬁt. Compliance with
SOX will help you turn your inventory silos into a collaborative supply-
chain network by deﬁning and implementing inventory processes that
cross supply-chain links. Everyone in the supply chain will be more aware
of inventory levels, inventory accuracy, and inventory valuation. This can
only make your supply chain stronger as you move forward to rightsize
your inventory.

Rightsizing Inventory
Additional Inventory Rightsizing Tips
TIP #33: Inventory moves into our ﬁnancial reporting
system as an asset on our balance sheet, and remains there
until it is shipped and billed to a customer (accounts
receivable), or disposed of in some form or another.
Inventory is an asset as long as it is used up for its intended purpose
and in a reasonable period of time. What is considered a reasonable
period of time? That is the question that must be answered by every
supply-chain professional, and the answer will be different for each supply
chain. As a general guideline, an inventory item may no longer be
considered an asset (conceptually) under the following conditions:
1.
There has been no inventory activity on the item for some pre-
deﬁned period of time (I suggest 12 months or more).
2.
The inventory item is damaged and can’t be repaired.
3.
There is no market demand for the item.
4.
The shelf life has passed or expired.
5.
The value of the item has reached scrap value or less.
6.
The item has been engineered out of the product and can’t be
used in another product.
7.
The item has been engineered out of the product for health or
safety reasons.
If any of these conditions exist, I suggest you consider getting rid of the
item. Why keep it? It is only taking up space and costing you money to
carry it in stock. To prevent any of these conditions from continuing, I
recommend the following:
1.
Establish a policy for inventory review (what, how).
2.
Review inventory for these conditions on a predetermined schedule.
3.
Have a plan in place to remove these items from inventory.
4.
Before getting rid of the item, notify the appropriate supply-chain link.
5.
Be prepared to be challenged by someone who wants to keep the
item in stock.
6.
Notify ﬁnance before scrapping large amounts of inventory.
7.
Keep an audit trail of what you did with the item.
TIP #34: Inventory also moves into our ﬁnancial reporting
system as a liability (if we didn’t pay for it yet) as part of

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

123
the accounts payable on our balance sheet, and remains
there until it is paid for.
Inventory not yet paid for is considered as part of your accounts
payable on the balance sheet and remains an accounts payable until it is
paid for (or in some cases, until returned to the supplier). Just as you
have an accounts receivable aging report, you can also have an accounts
payable aging report. It is important to keep an eye on the aging report.
This issue of paying invoices or not paying invoices can impact your
entire supply chain. All invoices should be paid on time and in accordance
with the stated terms and conditions. However, realistically, if you are
falling on hard times and can’t pay your supplier on time, the following
might occur:
1.
Your credit rating may be negatively impacted
2.
Supplier relationships will suffer
3.
Supplier may ask for cash on delivery (COD) for future shipments
(further eroding your cash ﬂow)
4.
You may have to pay a premium for the next shipment
5.
The supplier may not expedite your next delivery
6.
Your supplier may cut you off
7.
Word may get out to other suppliers that you are a bad risk
If you are going to be late (and I’m not suggesting that you should
be), at least let the appropriate supply-chain link know about it. I see
nothing wrong with publishing an accounts payable aging report inter-
nally to the appropriate people in your supply chain. If you only have
“n” number of dollars to pay bills, and you are late (the same amount
of time) on paying supplier A and supplier B, don’t leave it up to the
accounts payable department to make the decision on who to pay. It’s
not fair to them and in all probability, purchasing might make a better-
informed decision.
TIP #35: Finance looks at inventory turns and days of
supply in the aggregate, but for operations to address this
issue in its inventory rightsizing efforts, inventory turns,
days of supply, and COGS need to be broken down into
inventory types and families at the item-level detail.
There is no universal rule for the number of times inventory should
turn or how many days of supply a company should have. It will vary,
industry segment to industry segment. Even then, just because your
competition turns inventory ﬁve times a year, is that right for your

124

Rightsizing Inventory
company? The important thing to remember with this TIP is that different
internal supply chains will measure turns and days of supply differently.
For example, ﬁnance is concerned about the aggregate inventory and
looks at inventory in terms of dollars. Manufacturing, planning, purchasing,
and distribution look at inventory from an item point of view. These views
are not in conﬂict, merely different. You should, however, have goals and
objectives to satisfy both views. When establishing performance metrics,
consider the following:
1.
Find out what the standard and average is for each of your industry
segments: the Standard Industry Classiﬁcation (SIC Code). There
is information available in the marketplace.
2.
Find out (if possible) what your competition’s inventory turns and
days are.
3.
Establish performance metrics that best suit your different industry
SIC codes.
4.
Publish your performance metrics to all internal supply-chain links.
5.
Measure your actual performance to planned performance, and let
all links know how you are doing.
TIP #36: Analyze your inventory for activity. If there hasn’t
been any activity on an item in inventory for 12 months
or longer, consider disposing of it. This includes raw mate-
rials and ﬁnished goods.
This TIP is similar to TIP #33, but I would like to add a few more
points. If you don’t have the tools available to create such a report, ask
your IT folks to provide you with the information. In most cases, they
will be able to do so. Before you make the decision to get rid of inventory,
consider the following:
1.
Ask all appropriate supply-chain links if there is any valid reason
to keep the inventory.
2.
Ask design engineering if the material can be substituted for an
active material.
3.
Run a where-used report to see if there is another use for the
material in another product.
4.
Ask the supplier if he or she will take it back. (The supplier may
have a shortage and can use it for another customer; it doesn’t
hurt to ask.) There may be a restocking fee, but the value of the
credit received will more than offset the fee.
5.
Ask sales if there is another market for the product.

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

125
6.
If it is a ﬁnished product, ask sales if it can sell it at a discount.
7.
Ask if the product can be modiﬁed or converted into another
product.
8.
If it is a ﬁnished product you are getting rid of, be sure to use up
or get rid of all corresponding raw materials that go into the
product, if they can’t be used elsewhere.
TIP #37: There is a direct relationship between the level
of inventory carried and the cost of carrying inventory.
When the inventory level increases, carrying cost
increases; when the inventory level decreases, carrying
cost decreases.
Consider this scenario: In January you purchase all of part Y for the
entire year, consume it month to month and, ideally, it is all gone by the
end of December. You may have saved money on a “quantity buy” and
your risk of stockout is considerably lower throughout the year. On the
other hand, you have to pay for it by the end of February and have to
carry the item in stock all year long. If you buy the item month to month,
your carrying cost will go down, but your ordering cost will go up and
your risk of a stockout is far greater. The point is that there are trade-offs
in buying various quantities of material. In order to decide which approach
you should use, you have to consider all costs and look at the total cost
of acquisition. The following are costs to consider:
1.
Ordering cost
2.
Machine setup costs
3.
Item cost
4.
Carrying cost
5.
Item demand patterns
6.
Payment terms
7.
Forecast usage accuracy
8.
Item shelf life
9.
Item obsolescence
10.
Cash ﬂow
11.
Cash-to-cash cycle
12.
Item inventory turns
13.
Rarity of the item
14.
Potential for price increase
There is no easy answer to the question of how much to buy and when
to buy it. This list represents the things you should consider when answer-
ing this question. Some costs will go up and other costs will go down.

126

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #38: Select an inventory valuation method that best
reﬂects the true value of your inventory and conforms to
GAAP guidelines.
Careful attention should be given to the selection of an inventory
valuation method. The most popular two are FIFO and LIFO. Once you
have decided on a methodology, you will have to live with it for a while.
It is not something you can change every day. As explained earlier in this
chapter, a key consideration would be the replacement cost of inventory.
When inventory replacement costs are rising, charging inventory out at
LIFO will maximize the COGS expense and possibly minimize taxes, thus
increasing proﬁtability. The inventory valuation method chosen will have
a greater impact on items with a long shelf life. If an item has a very
short shelf life, then the gap between LIFO and FIFO will be less, and
the accounting method chosen will have less impact. A very important
point to be made here is that whatever method is chosen, you must
comply with GAAP rules and regulations and SOX.
TIP #39: Inventory valuation must be realistic and reﬂect
the true value of your inventory. Consider adjusting the
value of your inventory downward if it falls below the
current replacement cost or the current selling price of
the product. Take the loss earlier rather than later.
Referring back to TIP #38 along with TIP #39, ﬁnance should not, by
itself, decide on the accounting methodology to be used:
1.
Multiple supply-chain links should provide input.
2.
Purchasing can provide input on the replacement costs of items.
3.
Use the 80/20 rule when looking at replacement costs.
4.
Marketing and sales can provide input on future selling prices.
5.
Your outside auditor should be a good source on which method-
ology to use.
6.
Constantly monitor the value of your inventory to see if an account-
ing method change is in order.
7.
Always, always follow GAAP guidelines.
Inventory Reserves
TIP #39 states that you should “take the loss earlier rather than later.” By
that I mean, if an item in inventory has no value, or its value is less than
the cost to make it, and you decide to scrap or sell it below cost, you

Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

127
must still account for it. Many companies set up an inventory reserve
account to deal with this inventory write-off or re-evaluation. A write-off
may occur when the value of the inventory is less than its book value
and, in some cases, the inventory item is no longer usable. Inventory
reserve is an accounting entry, reducing earnings for the purpose of fairly
representing the value of inventory on the balance sheet. This concept
considers the fact that not all inventory will be sold to cover the cost of
the product. If the cost of inventory exceeds the market value, the
inventory value must be adjusted on the balance sheet. A company would
not deliberately produce and stock an item in inventory at a cost that
exceeds market value. Inventory reserves are typically stated and valued
using either the cost or market value method, whichever is lower. It is
misleading to carry an item in inventory with a value of say $5 each when
it has no value in the marketplace and you have to actually pay someone
to take it away. Don’t wait.
TIP #40: Cost accounting must capture the true cost of
adding value to a raw material, so that ﬁnished goods are
valued correctly for sales and marketing to establish selling
prices that conform to company proﬁtability guidelines.
You cannot correctly establish proﬁtable selling prices without knowing
what the item cost you. I have seen cases where companies thought they
were making a proﬁt on a product, and when they captured their actual
cost they found out they were losing money on every sale. In this TIP,
I state that cost accounting must capture the true cost. I am using the
term cost accounting as an activity, not a job title. The goal is to capture
all the costs to bring the product to market, not just the manufacturing
cost. Once you have identiﬁed all the costs, you can then apply an
appropriate proﬁt margin on top of that. I’m sure you have heard stories
about companies whose costs are greater than their competitions’ selling
price. Needless to say, those companies must change, or they will quickly
be forgotten.
Standard Cost
Many companies establish a standard cost at the beginning of every year.
The purpose is to establish a baseline product or order cost to the company
and then compare actual cost to this standard. The difference between
standard cost and actual cost is calculated, and the difference is called a
variance, either favorable or unfavorable. Typically, companies don’t
change the standard cost during the year unless there is a dramatic change

128

Rightsizing Inventory
in the actual costs. Unfortunately, many companies don’t do a good job
of capturing the actual cost and make the assumption that the actual cost
is pretty close to the standard cost. There is only one way to ﬁnd out:
capture your actual costs.
Current Cost
As the year progresses, costs will change. The current cost method captures
the current cost of materials, labor, and overhead. For example, let’s say
you start out in January, and one of your primary raw materials costs $10
each. There is a shortage of this product in the marketplace, and by March
the cost has doubled to $20 each. This may cause you to change your
standard cost to the current cost. Of course, given the capability and time,
you may want to compare actual cost to both standard cost and current
cost and track the variances to both.
Average Cost
Another method calculates an average cost. Typically, this is a method
using a weighted average, based on quantity, of an item’s cost. This
averaging considers both the LIFO and FIFO inventory valuation methods,
and also considers labor and overhead in the equation. Once again, you
can compare average cost to actual cost and report the variance. Like the
current cost method, dramatic changes may occur during the year, and
adjustments may have to be made to the average cost calculation.
Activity-Based Costing (ABC)
This method captures activities performed, accumulates these costs and
then applies cost drivers to allocate these costs to products, orders, or
projects. The concept is to apply overhead costs more realistically. If you
can do this, you approach a true actual cost. For example, let’s say you
have a machining work center, and you are making a batch of 500 widgets
in the work center. If you can capture the actual electricity used (overhead)
in the work center to make that batch, you truly are capturing actual cost.
Although ABC may be the most accurate of all the costing methods, it
can be the most challenging to implement.
The key to using this TIP effectively is not in the cost accounting
method used, but in capturing the actual cost of making the product.
Once this is known, you can add on all other costs such as sales, general,

and administrative (SG&A), and then mark it up to give your company a
reasonable proﬁt.
TIP #41: As a raw material moves through the manufac-
turing process, labor adds value and increases the cost of
the item. If the item goes back into inventory, it goes back
at a higher cost, thus increasing the total value of the
inventory. If possible, delay adding value to a raw material
until it can be shipped without going back into inventory.
The point of this TIP is to delay adding value (labor) to a raw material
or subassembly until a later time or a later step in the supply-chain process.
If you add labor to a raw material and put it back in inventory as an
intermediate product or subassembly, several things have occurred:
1.
You have to pay for the labor well in advance of using the product.
2.
You have committed to a particular conﬁguration of the product.
It can’t be changed without adding more cost, assuming you can
change it at all.
3.
You will incur an inventory carrying cost.
4.
You may have bought the raw material earlier than you needed
to and have to pay for it earlier.
5.
Making it early may hurt your cash ﬂow.
6.
You could have used the money elsewhere (opportunity cost).
You can help prevent this from happening by:
1.
Delaying raw material deliveries until needed
2.
Decreasing raw material delivery times
3.
Designing products with modularity, so that adding value to a raw
material can occur easier and closer to the customer delivery date
4.
Designing processes so that value added steps can be combined
and performed later in the process
TIP #42 Inventory inaccuracy has a negative impact on
the entire supply chain, can decrease customer service
and productivity levels, and can increase costs. You must
improve inventory accuracy.
Inventory inaccuracy causes an enormous amount of problems, as dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter. In later chapters, we will come back to this
topic again and discuss ways to improve inventory accuracy — in partic-

ular, the use of cycle counting. Some steps you should consider taking
are the following:
1.
Measure your current level of inventory accuracy by inventory
category: raw material, work-in-process, and ﬁnished goods.
2.
Assign inventory accuracy accountability to appropriate (and mul-
tiple) links in your supply chain.
3.
Develop and implement a plan to improve inventory accuracy.
4.
Continuously measure inventory accuracy, and report results to all
supply-chain managers.
5.
Identify and ﬁx the causes of inventory inaccuracy.
TIP #43: Each company must deﬁne the criteria used to
measure inventory accuracy, measure accuracy against the
criteria, and communicate all this to all employees in the
supply chain.
This TIP, although similar to TIP #42, focuses on one important difference:
Different links in the supply chain will focus on different criteria. For
example, sales will focus on the need for ﬁnished goods accuracy in units.
Production, planning, and purchasing will focus on the need for raw
material and work-in-process accuracy in units, and ﬁnance will focus on
the need for inventory accuracy in all three categories, but in dollars rather
than units.
Because the inventory is the responsibility of the entire internal supply
chain, all links must be aware of and responsible for inventory accuracy
across all categories and value measurements. The goal should be 100
percent inventory accuracy in the entire supply chain. The rules are simple:
1.
Measure current accuracy.
2.
Identify and ﬁx causes of inventory inaccuracy.
3.
Establish procedures to prevent causes from occurring again.
4.
Communicate results to everyone.
5.
Repeat the ﬁrst step.
Table 3.10 represents the most current status of the Woodstock inventory,
and Table 3.11 represents the inventory targets by division and inventory
category.

Company Money
March 19, Harmony Team Meeting
Woodstock Inventory: $40.6 Million
My name is Rudy and I’m vice president of sales and marketing
for Woodstock Lighting Group
Boy, I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to working here. It is unlike any other
company I’ve ever worked for. The pressure and politics are the worst I’ve
ever experienced. That reminds me, my wife is going to kill me if I don’t
get out of here on time today. It’ll be just my luck that I’ll get a call from
an important customer at ﬁve minutes to ﬁve. Tonight is Trevor and
Cameron’s soccer game, and it’s for the league championship. Afterwards,
we promised Preston and the big guys we would take them out for ice
cream. It’s going to be a big family night!
I don’t understand what Joe’s problem is. They asked us for a forecast,
and we gave it to them; then they completely ignore it and make what
they want anyway. Why I bother, I’ll never know. I’m just a nice guy, I
guess. I am constantly making up excuses to our customers as to why we
are late on their orders. I’ve got it down to a science: the raw material
supplier delivered late; our production equipment broke down; we made

your product, but the quality was poor and we have to make it again;
you told us to rush your order for product A, so we had to reschedule your
order out for product B; and my favorite excuse, “Didn’t you get the
message I left with your secretary? I had a question about your order and
we were holding up production until we heard from you.” Which excuse
should I use with the next customer, excuse #1 or excuse #2? Oh, well, let
me get started with these people so I can clean up my desk and get out of
here on time.
Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money — 
a Lot of Money
Our ﬂashlight business is a commodity business, and if we don’t have
the inventory that customers want, they will go elsewhere to place their
order. The same is true for spare parts sold by the Beacon Light Division.
If it isn’t in stock, they will go elsewhere. If we have stockouts often
enough, not only will we lose orders, but in the long run we will also
lose customers. Everyone knows we can’t afford for that to happen. We
in sales and marketing have two primary responsibilities, just as our title
implies: We market and sell our product lines. What’s the difference
between the two? Well, marketing creates awareness about our products,
and the sales team sells them.
Role and Responsibilities
Marketing
Marketing is responsible for market research, market demographics, and
identifying market trends. Marketing visits retail stores (Flashlight Division),
local governments, home and commercial building associations (Spotlight
Division), and state and federal agencies (Beacon Light Division). Marketing
also visits with our customers, large and small. The purpose of these visits
is to identify market trends, customer needs, and regulatory changes. Mar-
keting is also responsible for analyzing the competitive environment and
knowing what our competition is up to. Here is a list of primary activities:

Market research: Identify the marketplace: size, location, cus-
tomer type, trends, market forces, requirements, impact of external
factors such as economic conditions and government regulations.

Competitive analysis: Identify the competition’s strengths and
weaknesses, market share, and pricing structure.

Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

135

Marketing programs: Create product line brochures and other
marketing literature. Conduct customer focus group studies and
get customer feedback about our products.

Advertising: Product promotion through multimedia channels
such as TV, radio, print, and Internet.

Promotions: Create and implement customer incentive programs
(along with sales).

Product line forecasts: Along with sales and ﬁeld service (spare
parts), forecast product line sales for all products and services.
This is not all that marketing does, but it gives you an idea of what
it does in relation to the sales team. The primary overlap with sales is in
the forecasting. Of course, marketing also looks to sales for input on what
the customers are saying and what the competition is doing. Marketing
takes all this input and formalizes it into marketing plans. You might be
wondering how marketing impacts our inventory rightsizing effort. Well,
it does so in both direct and indirect ways.
In a very direct way, marketing input on product forecasts is part of
our sales and operations plan. Our history has been, the higher the
forecast, the higher our inventory. I’m not saying that’s right, but it is a
known fact here at Woodstock, particularly with our ﬂashlight business
where, as you know, we use a make-to-stock strategy. An inaccurate
forecast can cause us to make too much or too little of a product, or
make the wrong products and not make the right ones. We will spend
more time on forecasts when we talk about the sales department.
I also said marketing impacts inventory in an indirect way. For example,
after everyone agrees on the forecast (or so we think), we manufacture
ﬂashlights to meet the forecast. Marketing then must implement programs
that help the sales team sell the product. If the marketing programs are
weak or nonexistent, we will probably sell less and be stuck with a lot
of inventory. I know for a fact this was the case when we came out with
the new L-shaped camper’s ﬂashlight.
The forecast was aggressive. We forecasted to sell 500,000 SKUs in a
12-month period. So manufacturing went ahead and made 250,000 and
put them into inventory. I don’t know the actual cost, but let’s say they
cost us $0.55 each, which is probably pretty close. We invested about
$137,500 in inventory. Marketing really blew this one. It didn’t include it
in our sales catalog and spent very little advertising it. The end result was
we barely sold 100,000 SKUs.
At the end of the year, we looked at the results and wrote this product
off as a loser. We deliberately didn’t include it in the catalog the second
year and had a zero advertising budget. The result is we sold less in the

136

Rightsizing Inventory
second year, about 50,000 or so, and still have 100,000 of these in
inventory, with no marketing plans whatsoever.
I bet a good number of the 150,000 units we did sell to our distributors
are still sitting on their shelves, because we didn’t help them with product
promotions and marketing materials. I think we should look at our
inventory levels and analyze our marketing programs to see if there is a
relationship between our inventory levels and our marketing efforts for
speciﬁc products. My understanding is, we have categorized our inventory
into ABC classiﬁcations. We will start with all A items and work our way
down through the product lines.
TIP #44: Marketing has a direct and indirect impact on
inventory levels and strategy. Typically, the higher the
forecast (make-to-stock strategy), the higher the inventory
level. Marketing programs and budgets should be set in
proportion to inventory levels and inventory strategy.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)
As I mentioned earlier, marketing is not alone when it comes to
developing the forecast. Almost every link in the supply chain has some-
thing to say about forecasts, some good and some bad. In the end, it is
management judgment that is the ﬁnal input to the forecast: Will the
customer buy our product?
Sales
The sales team is the group that has direct contact with our customers
and sells our products. Sales is on the front line, so to speak, and its
success (or failure) will dictate how well or how poorly we move inventory
through our supply chain. It is important that salespeople are knowledge-
able about the products they sell. In the case of the ﬂashlight products,
the product knowledge required is less than what is required to sell
beacon light systems. Here are some of their responsibilities:

Direct sales: Contacting customers via phone, e-mail, snail mail,
and direct meetings

Order processing: Ensuring that customer orders are processed
into the Woodstock customer order system; not directly, but
through proper channels

Customer product forecasts: Identifying customer requirements
over a given period of time

Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

137

Customer satisfaction: Ensuring that customers are satisﬁed with
Woodstock products and services

Customer problem solving: Anticipating customer problems and
following up on known problems

Sales forecasting: Taking the customer product forecasts and
developing product forecasts for aggregate product sales
Does sales have an impact on our inventory rightsizing efforts? It very
deﬁnitely does. Given their way, salespeople would like to have lots of
inventory available to satisfy customer needs whenever they receive an
order. So we have a direct conﬂict with ﬁnance about inventory levels.
As you’ve heard from ﬁnance, it wants relatively low levels of inventory
because it costs so much money. Now you are hearing from sales that it
wants relatively high inventory levels because, if it doesn’t have it, the
customer may go elsewhere.
Who does production listen to, ﬁnance or sales? This is a classic struggle
that has been going on for some time. Now throw in some of the other
links in the chain, and it gets more complicated. Take a look at Table
4.1, and you begin to see the challenges we face. The terms high and
low are used in an ideal way. For example, when I say sales wants high
ﬁnished goods inventory, I mean it wants to have the product in stock
so that we don’t have a stockout when the customer orders it. Ideally,
they would rather have a high inventory of ﬁnished goods inventory.
Because we have yet to reduce our lead times and manufacturing cycle
times, we will have to live with these conﬂicting objectives longer than
we would like to. We can all agree that once we improve our response
times, all supply-chain links will want lower inventories.

Rightsizing Inventory
As the expression goes, “We want to have our cake and eat it too.”
There aren’t many companies out there that have solved this problem.
Oh, sure, you will hear and read about a “world-class” company that has
dramatically reduced inventory without sacriﬁcing customer service; but
they are few and far between. Most of us are struggling with this problem.
Hopefully, the Harmony Team will put us in the world-class category; I
certainly hope so. High inventory hides a lot of problems.
TIP #45: Supply-chain links within a single supply chain
may have conﬂicting inventory goals and objectives. You
cannot rightsize your inventory until these conﬂicting
objectives are resolved and balanced.
Sales and Operations Planning
One of the ways that companies are dealing with all these conﬂicting
objectives is by going through a process popularly known as sales and
operations planning (S&OP). Essentially, S&OP is a planning process of
integrating customer-focused marketing plans and all our supply-chain
link plans into one homogeneous set of plans for our entire supply chain.
It is a consensus-based process.
The process helps to reconcile all supply and demand conﬂicts at both
the detail and aggregate levels. The planning horizon for this process
should go as far out into the future as necessary to plan for acquiring the
resources necessary to achieve the business plan for the near to interme-
diate terms. Once created, it is reviewed and adjusted on a weekly or
monthly basis, depending on the nature of your business. If used properly,
it links strategic plans with the tactical execution plans. It is used to
monitor performance against the plans so that adjustments and improve-
ments can be made on a continuous basis. From what I’ve read and
learned, there are ﬁve stages of S&OP planning. Table 4.2 indicates the
ﬁve stages. There is no question in my mind that we are at stage one.
The closer we get to stage ﬁve, the more competitive we will be to reap
the beneﬁts of this collaborative planning process.
S&OP is a powerful tool that a company can use as a communication
vehicle with all links in the supply chain. The beneﬁts and rewards are huge:

Improved customer service (internal and external)

Inventory rightsizing

Efﬁcient operations (all links)

Effective decision making

Improved supply-chain communications


139

Improved morale and teamwork

Increased proﬁtability and return on assets (ROA)
I think it’s fair to say that S&OP can be viewed in three different ways:
It is a philosophy (a way of doing business), a technique (a business
operating process), and a computer (application) software. We will focus
our discussion on the philosophy and technique aspects and leave the
computer technology side to others. When attempting to balance supply
with demand, we have to understand what that means. S&OP is about
balancing sales (demand) with inventory (supply). The process will help
us answer six signiﬁcant questions about product family inventories over
a speciﬁed planning horizon:
1.
What is the demand for this product family?
2.
How much inventory do we have?
3.
How much inventory do we have to acquire?
4.
When is the inventory required?
5.
Do we have the resources to acquire the inventory?
6.
Does the S&OP plan meet the objects of the business plan?
We have to decide what to buy and make and how much; I say “buy
and make” because a manufacturing company has to buy raw materials
and then make the product. A distributor on the other hand has to decide
what to buy. Figure 4.1 illustrates this balance of supply and demand.
For those of you who are familiar with material requirements planning
(MRP), you may think I’m describing that technique; but I’m not. We are
not down to the SKU level yet. The S&OP is done at the product family
level. What do I mean by product family? In the case of a manufacturer,
which we are, a product family is based on the similarity of the manu-
facturing process, not the sales family. Let me illustrate this by an example.

Rightsizing Inventory
Let’s take a pharmaceutical company that manufactures aspirin, vitamins,
and allergy medications. The sales families would be just the aspirin,
vitamins, and allergy medications. You may or may not have different
sales forces selling each of these product families. Now let’s look at it
from a manufacturing point of view. Figure 4.2 illustrates a manufacturing
process that all three sales product families might go through. I may not
have the process exactly right, but you will get the idea.
Operation 1 is the weighing of ingredients. Each ingredient must be
precisely measured and weighed to a very strict formula governed by
regulatory guidelines. Operation 2 is where all the weighed ingredients
are mixed together in what looks like a big cake mixing bowl with huge
rotating blades. This mixing and blending operation is sometimes called
“product compounding.” After the ingredients are compounded, the batch
goes to Operation 3, where the compound is now compressed into tablets,
which we are all familiar with.
Depending on the product, it may move onto Operation 4 when a
coating is applied to the compressed tablets (making it easier to swallow).
From there the product moves on to Operation 5, where it is bottled into
various size bottles holding different quantities like 30, 50, or 100 tablets
each. The process I described doesn’t have to be continuous (occurring
one immediately after the other). Depending on product shelf life, a

compounded product could be inventoried in this bulk state and later
compressed into tablets. Similarly, the compressed tablets could be stocked
(again, shelf life dependent) and packaged later.
Having provided you with a visual aid, I can now make my point.
Each one of these operations is a manufacturing process that has capacity
limitations for any given period of time. Let’s take the compounding
operation as an example. All products that have to go through this
operation have a similarity of manufacturing process. Whether it is a
vitamin, aspirin, or allergy pill (three separate sales families), they all go
through one similar manufacturing process. In this example, it is the
compounding operation. This is the deﬁnition of a manufacturing product
family: similarity of the manufacturing process.
At this point in the planning process, we are planning at the aggregate
inventory demand and supply levels by product families. Later on in the
planning process, we will be developing another plan called the master
production schedule (MPS). The MPS is also a supply and demand
planning process, but at the detailed item level. I know that Cyndie in
planning will explain this in detail when you meet with her. I bring it up
now because it is important for us to understand that the S&OP plan and
the MPS must be in balance with each other. Figure 4.3 illustrates where
S&OP ﬁts in the enterprise planning process.
S&OP Characteristics Related to Inventory
Let me share with you some of the characteristics of the S&OP.

The focus is on the customer: You will learn later that two of
the primary inputs are a forecast of external customer needs (for
inventory) and a forecast of internal customer needs to produce
and stock inventory. The process must be responsive to the cus-
tomers’ needs as they change.

Must be in harmony with the business plan: The S&OP plan
must take into account all of the elements of the business plan. It
must be in agreement with the ﬁnancial plan, cash ﬂow, proﬁt-
ability, capital expenditures, facility planning, resource levels (peo-
ple), equipment plans, and the like.

One integrated company plan: It is used by all links in the
supply chain to execute the business plan. The plan is visible and
available to all links, and performance to plan is measurable by
using dashboards and scorecards.

Rapid response to change: The S&OP is not a stagnant document.
The actual results must be compared to the plan, and change must

take place immediately. It must become a proactive planning
process and not a reactive planning process. The S&OP will drive
change on a continuous, as-needed basis.

Total supply-chain view considered: The S&OP must be tightly
coupled with the total supply chain to improve response time, oper-
ating efﬁciency, and ﬂexibility. The total supply-chain costs to bring
products to the market are a major element of the S&OP process.
Inventory Planning Zones
I know I’ve spoken a lot about making changes to the S&OP and how
important rapid response is in today’s marketplace, but, realistically, some
changes are easier to make than others. All plans, whether it is the S&OP,
MPS, or material or capacity requirements planning (MRP or CRP), have
“frozen” periods where change to a plan will be difﬁcult and costly to
make, but the effect on inventory can be huge.
Change and its impact will vary industrywide and companywide.
Conceptually, the S&OP is organized in monthly time buckets (periods)
with a planning horizon of one year or longer. The general rule is that
the S&OP plan should go as far out into the future as reasonable to
acquire the necessary long-term resources. Examples of long-term
resources that will take time to acquire are buying new capital equipment,
adding another shift, or opening a new plant or distribution center. I will
leave it to Cyndie to explain how planning zones work, but essentially it
is a block of time in the planning process where it is reasonable or not
reasonable to make changes to the plan.
TIP #46: The purpose of establishing inventory planning
zones is to recognize the degree of difﬁculty to make
changes and to allow enough time for all supply-chain links
to react to the change in an economical, efﬁcient manner.
Balancing the Major Components of S&OP
As I stated earlier, the object of the S&OP process is to balance supply
and demand and achieve the goals outlined in the business plan. The
major components of the S&OP plan consist of

Customer and forecast demand (demand planning)

Inventory plans

Production and distribution plans

144

Rightsizing Inventory

Resource requirements and availability

Lead-time requirements
All these components must be in balance, and a change in any one
of these elements will drive changes in the other components. We will
go through several iterations of planning before we get it right. Figure
4.3 shows the closed-loop iterative process of change.
Demand Planning
Demand planning is at the very heart of the S&OP process, and it can
be the most difﬁcult to get right. It is the activity of planning demand for
all products and services the company offers to internal and external
customers. Demand is then evaluated against the resources we have. The
inputs to demand planning come from many sources. Here are the primary
ones that we should be looking at for Woodstock:

Customer plans: This should come from our CRM process. It is
the “voice of the customer.” The more we know about our cus-
tomers, the more accurate our demand planning will be.

Market intelligence: We need to understand our buyers’ customer
needs. Our customers are mostly distributors and large retail chains
(Flashlight Division). We also need to understand the market trends
that are affecting the end users (consumers) in this market.

Competitive intelligence: We need to understand our competi-
tors, what they are doing, and what they are not doing that may
affect our plans. We compete in a global marketplace, and new
competitors are popping up around the world.

Internal marketing plans: Our marketing programs and promo-
tions will impact the demand for our products. We have 2 new
ﬂashlight products and 3 new spotlight products that will be
released within the next 12 months. How much effort and dollars
we put into promoting these new products will impact the demand
for them.

Historical sales data: We have been selling these and similar
products since 1942, and we have a great deal of history on what
we’ve sold in the past. Of course, we cannot assume the future
will be like the past, because so many things have changed over
the years. Historical data will give us a good benchmark to use,
and we can apply mathematical formulas to this historical data to
project future requirements.


with our customers. We can also get input from our ﬁeld service
personnel and our spare parts team in the Beacon Light Division.
Inventory and Sales Forecasting
Ah, we ﬁnally come to it … the forecast! The net result of looking at all
these inputs is to develop a projection of demand, called “the forecast.”
Now, unless you are a company with ﬁve years’ of order backlog, like
an airplane manufacturer, you don’t have the luxury of knowing what
your customers will buy and when they will buy it. For that reason‚ we
have to forecast the demand. Over- or underforecasting has a direct impact
on inventory levels. Overforecasting will cause us to make more inventory,
and inventory levels will increase if we don’t sell it. Underforecasting will
cause inventory levels to decrease, but may result in inventory stockouts.
Although all links in the supply chain have input to the sales forecast,
it is the primary responsibility of sales and marketing to put it all together.
The forecast is a process resulting in a formal input to the S&OP process.
This forecast will cause purchasing to buy raw materials, manufacturing
to produce ﬁnished product, and distribution to stock inventory.
TIP #47: Forecasting has a direct impact on inventory
levels. Overforecasting may cause inventory levels to
increase if it’s not sold, whereas underforecasting will
decrease inventory levels but may lead to stockouts.
Of course there are other operational issues with over- and under-
forecasting, but our focus today is on inventory. There are many issues
that must be considered when developing the forecast. Let’s discuss some
of them:
1.
Forecast accuracy: There is one accurate statement we can make
about the forecast: The forecast is always inaccurate. I don’t know
of any supply chain out there today that has a perfect forecast. If
we are lucky, we may get the forecast right for one or two products,
but we will get most of them wrong.
2.
Product families versus speciﬁc SKUs: We can more accurately
forecast the total sales for a product family than we can forecast
individual SKUs within a product family. But in the ﬁnal analysis,
we must convert the forecast into meaningful production units.
3.
Long term versus short term: Forecasts are more accurate in
the short term than they are in the long term. In other words, we
can forecast this month’s sales more accurately than we can next

146

Rightsizing Inventory
year’s sales. But for long-lead-time items, we must forecast the
demand required to cover the cumulative lead time.
4.
Degree of accuracy: Forecasts work better when planning for a range
of forecast accuracy rather than an absolute number. For example,
using plus/minus 10 percent rather than 100 percent accuracy.
5.
Forecast change: I referred earlier to inventory planning zones. I
worked for a company once that was having a bad ﬁnancial year.
It got to the 11th month of the year and it was off by 35 percent.
They adjusted their forecast downward and made 95 percent of their
adjusted forecast! They weren’t fooling anyone but themselves. How-
ever, market conditions do change‚ and we must be as responsive
as we can to adjusting and changing market conditions.
6.
Forecast accountability: Although sales and marketing have pri-
mary responsibility for developing the forecast, all links in the
internal supply chain should have input to the forecast and strive
to meet the level of the forecast. Remember what I said earlier:
Everyone is responsible for inventory rightsizing; because the fore-
cast has a signiﬁcant impact on inventory, it must be monitored
and adjusted as necessary and realistically.
7.
Sales force incentives: We should conduct a careful analysis of
sales force incentives. I know if I were a salesperson (which I
was) I would focus on selling the products that rewarded me the
most ﬁnancially. It is important that sales incentives be aligned to
forecast numbers and inventory levels.
8.
Forecast assumptions: Be careful about the assumptions used in
developing your forecast. Using only historical data for existing
products is not necessarily the right thing to do. We cannot assume
the future will be like the past.
9.
External factors: We need to also consider factors outside of our
direct control like environmental, government, and regulatory
issues that could affect our forecast.
I don’t want to dwell on these issues too much. I am merely trying
to make the point that forecasting is a difﬁcult task and needs to be
watched carefully. World-class companies have the ability to respond to
changes in a timely manner. Those companies that can will have a greater
chance of rightsizing inventory than those that can’t.
TIP #48: The ability to rapidly respond to forecast
changes will greatly improve your ability to rightsize your
inventory.

One of the points I should have made earlier is about forecasting
in dollars versus forecasting in units. Our sales and marketing team
feels more comfortable forecasting in dollars rather than in units. Our
operating links need to plan for inventory in units. Keep in mind that
we are still at the S&OP level where we are dealing with product
families; so we are not looking at individual SKUs yet but need to
convert dollars into product family units. It would be great if our Sales
Team could forecast in units rather than dollars. I’m going to ask my
team to do this.
You can help me by providing our sales history in units rather than
dollars. This will give the team a benchmark to work from. There are
several ways we can develop the forecast. Figure 4.4 demonstrates a
bottom-up and a top-down approach to forecasting. We need to do both,
then compare the two methods and agree on one set of numbers.
Customer demand variability has a signiﬁcant impact on the entire
supply chain. Even a small variability in end customer demand will expand
successively upstream through the supply chain. This is known as the
bullwhip effect, and the amount of variation grows at each link upstream
from the end customer.
Basic Forecasting Techniques
Intrinsic forecasting techniques deal with historical data from past sales
performance. This is known as time series models. I will brieﬂy describe
some of the time series techniques we are looking at implementing here
at Woodstock.

Rightsizing Inventory
Naïve Forecasting
This is a very simple concept, and one that we have used in the past.
There is not much to it and‚ quite frankly, when we have used it in the
past it has proven to be inaccurate more often than not. Naïve forecasting
assumes that demand in the next time period will be the same as the
demand in the last period. This technique doesn’t allow for ﬂuctuations
in demand such as seasonality. We have decided that this isn’t a technique
for us.
Moving Average Forecast
Unlike the naïve forecast, where you use the most recent period to forecast
demand for the next period, the moving average technique uses the
average demand from a series of preceding periods. As the current period
passes, the earliest period is dropped from the calculation and the most
current past period is added. This dropping and adding of periods is why
it is called “a moving average.” Let’s look at an example, as shown in
Table 4.3:
Using a three-month moving average, the forecast for April would be
April forecast = (20 + 30 + 40)/3 = 30
So‚ in this example your new forecast for April would be 30 units.
Now let’s say‚ for whatever reason‚ you actually sold 50 units for April.
You would drop January from the calculation and add April to calculate
the May demand. Now the calculation looks like this:
May forecast = (30 + 40 + 50)/3 = 40
The forecast for May is 40 units. This is a very simple formula and is
somewhat more realistic than the naïve method. However, there is a
drawback. The moving average forecast lags the trend. Although the trend

shows the May forecast is 10 units greater than the April forecast, you
will note that the sales trend has been increasing by 10 units every month
since January (20–30–40–50), and if this pattern continues in May, the
May actual will be closer to 60 than 40. This is why we say that the
moving average lags behind the trend and is hard to detect. The more
time periods used, the more it will lag the trend. However, it does ﬁlter
out random variation. For this reason, we have decided that this won’t
work for us at Woodstock.
Weighted Moving Average
A weighted moving average will provide a more realistic look at detecting
trends. This places more dependence on the most recent periods and less
on earlier periods. Using the data we used earlier to calculate the May
forecast, we now place more weight on April than we do on February:
May forecast = (F 1 × 30 + M 2 × 40 + A 3 × 50)/6 = 260/6 = 43
You will note that the May forecast of 43, calculated from the weighted
moving average, is higher than the 40 calculated using the simple moving
average, although it still lags the trend. The difﬁcult part here is in deciding
which weights to use in each period. For that reason, I am not comfortable
using this technique for Woodstock. Let me discuss another technique,
which I believe will be more appropriate for us to use.
Exponential Smoothing
Exponential smoothing is similar to the weighted average moving forecast,
but takes the calculation a step further by adding a smoothing constant.
The exponential smoothing formula uses three factors: the last period’s
forecast, the last period’s actual demand, and a smoothing constant, which
is a number between 0 and 1 indicated by the Greek letter alpha (α).
The formula is as follows:
New forecast = Previous period forecast +
α(Last period demand – Last period forecast)
NF = PPF + α(LPD – LPF)
The equation produces a weighted average of the previous results.
There is no need to recalculate data from a number of preceding periods;
the calculation does it for you, eliminating the need to maintain data from

150

Rightsizing Inventory
a number of preceding periods. Let’s go back to our January, February,
and March forecasts. Using the simple moving average, we calculated
April as follows:
April forecast = (20 + 30 + 40)/3 = 30
Now let’s use the weighted moving average:
April forecast = (J 1 × 20 + F 2 × 30 + M 3 × 40)/6 = 200/6 = 33
Now we will use the exponential smoothing formula with an alpha
constant of 4:
April forecast = 40 + .4 (50 – 40) = 44
Note that with each succeeding technique, the April forecast moves
closer to the trend. However, exponential smoothing still lags the trend
but not by as much. The higher the constant, the more weight is given
to the actual demand from the preceding period. Determining the best
smoothing constant to use is critical for using this technique successfully.
This may be accomplished by trial and error until we are satisﬁed that it
is as close to reality as possible. There are other forecasting techniques
available, such as double smoothing and seasonal indexing, but this is
where we should start. We are in the process of implementing a forecasting
system utilizing exponential smoothing. It should greatly improve our
forecasting accuracy, which shouldn’t be difﬁcult because we don’t have
a forecasting tool in place today. Today, we mostly look at what we’ve
done in the past and estimate a percentage increase over the preceding
year’s sales. It will take us several months to implement, but later in the
year it should help us in our inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #49: Selection and successful implementation of a
forecasting tool will greatly improve your chances of right-
sizing your inventory.
Other Sources of Demand Planning
As I’ve stated earlier, a forecast of customer requirements is an important
element of the S&OP process. But there are other sources of demand for
inventory that have to be taken into consideration when developing the
S&OP. Here are some of those other sources:

Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

151

Research and development (R&D): Our R&D folks are constantly
taking raw materials and ﬁnished goods out of inventory to conduct
experiments. We must take into account their needs when fore-
casting demand.

Destructive testing: Our quality team takes samples from inventory
and puts parts through a process to determine product line cycles.
Over the course of a year the team takes and uses hundreds of
parts. These parts were bought and made based on customer use.

Spare parts: We really have a problem with this one. We buy and
make parts that go into our beacon light product line as part of
the ﬁnished product. Some of these parts are also sold as spare
parts through our service department. We should forecast this
demand separately.

Special promotions: We give a lot of products away as part of our
marketing program. This is especially true in our Flashlight Divi-
sion. Twice a year we have a promotion that we offer to our large
retail customers. It is a classic “buy one, get one at half price”
deal. We need to put these promotions in our forecast.

Intracompany requirements: There is a lot of inventory transferring
going on between our three divisions (and our service department).
These intracompany requirements should be forecasted.
TIP #50: All sources of demand must be considered
when planning for inventory supply and demand at the
S&OP level.
Monitoring the Forecast
We know that no matter what we do, the forecast isn’t going to be perfect.
We can only hope to achieve a degree of forecast accuracy. We will
measure actual demand against the forecast and publish the results. This
should not be a passive activity. We should use the monthly results as a
proactive tool and make adjustments as necessary. Table 4.4 shows data
for the last six months of the last ﬁscal year: the actuals versus forecasts
for our light bar product #070250.
Note that the cumulative variation for the six-month period does not
equal zero. Bias exists in this forecast because we consistently undersold
the forecast for four months in a row. If we had the same cumulative
variation for the six-month total, but the period-to-period variation alter-
nated from overselling to underselling the forecast, we could say that
there is no bias in this forecast, but it exhibits random variation. It’s time
we let all supply-chain managers know how the company is doing month

152

Rightsizing Inventory
to month. I will start to publish the sales results monthly to all supply-
chain managers.
Inventory and the Production Plan
We have discussed demand planning as one of the major inputs to the
S&OP. The next step is to develop a production plan. A production plan
is a document (plan) that establishes the overall level of production
required to satisfy the company’s business plan, which includes the
demand planning element, already discussed. The production plan is
sometimes referred to as the operations plan. In this step of the S&OP
process, we take the sales forecast by sales product family; if it is in
dollars, we convert it into units based on the similarity of the manufacturing
process, as I stated earlier.
This is no small task, but it doesn’t have to be as daunting as it ﬁrst
appears. I remember in my last job, my boss literally developed a pro-
duction plan on the back of an envelope while we were out to lunch.
Six months later I looked at what he wrote on that envelope, and he
wasn’t that far off! Now I realize that the S&OP process has gotten more
sophisticated; there is software to help us go through this process in a
formal manner. In my opinion, we are looking for a ballpark estimate of
how close or how far off we are from meeting the requirements of the
business plan.
We should keep it as simple as possible and look at manufacturing
processes that may be bottlenecked, based on the demand planning
portion of the S&OP. I know that Arnie, Cyndie, Eddie, and the process
design team are familiar with our product lines and can develop a
production plan based on the similarity of the manufacturing processes.
I will provide the forecast in units rather than dollars, and that should

help. In time, this should help improve the forecast accuracy. Let’s face
it — it can’t get any worse!
The production plan is a great tool and will help us in more ways
than one. It can be used to help us

Control and rightsize our inventory levels

Maintain customer service levels

Identify where and when resources are required (labor, equipment,
materials, and cash)

Balance supply and demand
Production Plan Principles
1.
It should go as far out into the future as needed to obtain the
resources necessary to meet the requirements of the S&OP.
2.
The planning horizon is usually 12 or more calendar months.
3.
The buckets of time are usually monthly.
4.
It is established for product families based on the similarity of the
manufacturing process.
5.
It is used to satisfy a variety of management objectives.
6.
At the end of the production plan process, supply and demand
should be in balance. The process iteration continues until they are.
7.
All of the internal supply-chain links must be in agreement on the
numbers represented in the production plan. It is literally a contract
between all links in the supply chain.
8.
The production plan drives all subsequent planning processes.
9.
The production plan should not be over/understated. It must be
realistic and achievable.
10.
Actual production plan results must be documented and commu-
nicated to all supply-chain links.
As you can see, this is a powerful tool if used correctly. I would like
to demonstrate just how this tool can work to satisfy many business
objectives.
Woodstock Business Plan Scenario
I don’t know if you are aware of it or not, but our business plan has
many requirements and restrictions that you need to know before you
can develop a production plan. There is a hiring freeze, which means
that we can’t hire any more direct labor personnel. There is a capital

154

Rightsizing Inventory
expense freeze, so we can’t buy any more equipment. It further states
that no overtime is permitted unless absolutely necessary to satisfy a major
customer requirement and that all overtime must be approved by Joe or
Adriana. The business plan states that we must meet the sales forecast
without increasing inventory levels. In fact, the business plan states that
overall inventory levels must be reduced by 10 percent in value by the
year-end. The business plan further states that we cannot outsource or
subcontract any production or distribution work this ﬁscal year. You cannot
develop a realistic, achievable production plan without knowing all this.
TIP #51: The business plan is a major input to the S&OP
process; a realistic, achievable production plan cannot be
developed without knowing and following the guidelines
that are established in the business plan.
TIP #52: The production plan, as part of the S&OP pro-
cess, is an important tool that, if used correctly, can help
us rightsize our inventory.
This scenario tells us a great deal about how we will do business this
year. I hope you were aware of it. March is almost over, and if this is the
ﬁrst you are hearing about it, that is a shame, and management, which
includes me, should be embarrassed. Developing a production plan is not
my area of expertise, but my team and I have worked ofﬂine with Arnie,
picked several sales product families, and converted the data into units
based on the similarity of the manufacturing process.
We have chosen our fabrication work cell. As you may be aware, a
work cell is the same as a work center or a work module. By deﬁnition,
it is a place on the factory ﬂoor where work is performed to transform
raw materials into different products. This is called the transformation
process. The fabrication work cell takes raw material, in this case rolls of
sheet metal, and stamps out lens cover frames, primarily for spotlights
and beacon lights. These are housings that hold the lens in place — but
you already know that. So we took the forecast (demand planning) and
summarized all products that go through the fabrication work cell. We
came up with the demand forecast, indicated in Figure 4.5.
The chart in Figure 4.5 is called a planning grid and is used to develop
the S&OP. You will note that the planning horizon goes out 12 periods,
called “buckets of time,” and each bucket represents one calendar month.
Note that the starting inventory is 60 units (Actually 60,000 units — 000
understood as omitted). We want to determine how much production we
need each month to satisfy the forecast demand, and because adding
production capacity (resources) and working overtime are taboo, we must

Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

155
make the schedule as level as possible. In addition to that, we want to
reduce inventory on this product family by 20 percent, which we believe
is realistic.
Wow, that’s a big challenge — where do we begin? Well, surprisingly
the calculations are relatively easy; it is the execution that might be difﬁcult.
If we reduce the inventory by 20 percent, it will go from 60 units down
to 48 units, which will satisfy the inventory reduction requirement:
60 × .20 = 12
60 – 12 = 48
So ask yourself, how much do we need to satisfy customer demand
over this planning horizon? The answer is 840 units:
Forecast demand =
60 + 60 + 60 + 80 + 80 + 80 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 840
To determine the amount of production required, the formula is
Production =
(forecast + ending inventory) – beginning inventory
(840 + 48) – 60 = 828
To have a level production plan for this product family for the entire
12-month period, the formula is
Monthly production =
Total production required/Number of months in plan
828/12 = 69

Rightsizing Inventory
Has this plan met the requirements of the business plan? Let’s review
the objectives:
1.
Reduce inventory on this product family by 20 percent: Yes, inven-
tory will decrease by 12 units by the end of the plan horizon.
2.
Produce at level rate throughout the year: Yes, we will produce
69 units every month.
3.
Satisfy customer requirements without reducing service levels: Yes,
with this plan the probability of a stockout is minimal.
4.
No overtime or capital equipment authorized. Don’t know; we
have yet to check resources available.
One issue I see here is that inventory will increase before it goes
down, and we will have the added cost of carrying it in stock for a while.
TIP #53: Do not attempt to drastically reduce inventory
levels of active items until the impact on customer service
levels is understood by all links in the supply chain. Plan
to reduce inventory, then measure customer service per-
formance. If there is no negative impact on customer
service, plan to reduce inventory again.
Not bad, huh? So there you have it. We have satisﬁed many manage-
ment objectives with this plan, and (hopefully) the plan also meets our
customer requirements. On paper we have balanced supply with demand
— or have we? What is missing with this S&OP plan? You probably guessed
by now that we haven’t answered an important question: Do we have
the necessary resources to meet the production requirements for
each period of the S&OP?
Validating the Sales and Operations Plan
I’m really getting out of my element here, but with the help of industrial
engineering and planning, we’ve come up with some ballpark numbers
to verify the S&OP. We’ve taken what I will call a “bill of resources” and
calculated the resources required to make one lens cover. Remember, we
are at the product family level and not talking about speciﬁc products.
The same is true for resources required. We are not talking about “machine
#2, next Wednesday, and Mary working on the second shift.” We are still
looking at the forest and not the trees. So, here goes:
The fabrication work cell has two machines, and each machine requires
one operator to run it. Three operations are required to complete a lens

Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

157
cover, and the two machines can perform all three operations, if needed
(although dies are limited to two for each operation):
Operation 1 — Stamp out the lens cover from a roll of sheet metal.
Operation 2 — Punch holes in each lens cover, and punch out
the center.
Operation 3 — Bend the lens cover to form.
Because these are highly automated processes, a lens cover can be
transformed in about 15 seconds of run (manufacturing) time. Remember,
we omitted three zeros, so we are talking about producing 69,000 units
each month. Roughly, the calculation goes like this:
15 seconds × 69,000 = 1,035,000 seconds
1,035,000/60 = 17,250 minutes
17250/60 = 287.5 hours
287.5/20 days per month (average) = 14 hours per day
14/6.5 hours per machine = 2 machines required
Excluding machine setup time (which can be an issue), we barely have
the needed capacity to meet this plan. We require two machines and
operators and we have them. Machine operators are not the problem.
Our people are cross-trained, and we could move someone in if the
assigned operator is out. It is the equipment I am worried about. You
know Murphy’s Law: What can go wrong, will go wrong. If one of these
machines breaks down, we will not meet the plan.
Do we need to buy another press machine or add another shift? The
production people don’t think so. But we may need to work an occasional
Saturday or have overtime during the week. The maintenance people will
have to stay on top of the equipment to keep it running smoothly, and
our machine setup team will have to do machine changeovers quickly.
We will have to get authorization from Joe to work overtime.
Is this a good plan? I really don’t know, but it gives us a good set of
data to discuss, plan for, and take action. That is the purpose of the S&OP:
to see if supply and demand are in balance to meet the customer and
company requirements. We are looking at the big picture and want to
know if we need to get resources that may take a long time to acquire,
like buying a new machine or adding a shift, or if necessary, to outsource

158

Rightsizing Inventory
production. I know the business plan doesn’t allow for these options, but
we need to know if we are in trouble because of these restrictions or not.
Executing the S&OP
That concludes my presentation on the S&OP process. We will work with
manufacturing, planning, industrial engineering, and ﬁnance to begin this
process here at Woodstock. We will ask the information technology (IT)
team to begin looking for software to help us accomplish this, although
I must point out that I think we should start out slowly and get the process
down pat before we implement software to help us. We can’t do this with
every product family but, using the ABC approach, we will start out with
our most important products and our most critical resources. Everyone
can help identify the products and resources that are candidates for the
S&OP process.
I do know that once we develop the S&OP, it can be used by the
planning group to disaggregate the numbers and begin the execution
process. This plan will be the group’s primary input in developing MPS.
The two planning processes must be in sync. I think you should bring
in the planning team as soon as possible so that we can get it involved
with our efforts. Once developed, we must monitor our performance to
plan on a monthly basis and make changes, following the inventory time
zone guidelines I discussed earlier.
TIP #54: The S&OP process plays a major role in your
inventory rightsizing efforts. All other steps in the inven-
tory planning process are guided by the inventory plan-
ning numbers established in the S&OP.
That’s it for now. We in sales and marketing have a lot of work to do;
we all do. I know that we play an important role in our inventory
rightsizing effort, and we will do whatever we can to make it happen.
Thank you for your time.

1.
Not having the right inventory in stock can be just as
costly as having no inventory in stock.
2.
It is very competitive out there; if we can’t satisfy the
customer’s needs, the competition can and will.
3.
Marketing plays an important role by conducting an
analysis of the marketplace and providing input to
the forecasting process.
4.
Marketing programs, budgets, and efforts have an
impact on inventory levels.
5.
Our sales team not only sells our product lines but
also has responsibility for forecasting customer
requirements.
6.
We are reviewing our sales team incentive programs
to ensure that they are aligned with our inventory
strategy.
7.
We learned how to develop an S&OP plan.
8.
We have decided on a forecasting technique and will
begin using it to improve our forecasting accuracy. IT
is looking at forecasting software packages, along with
sales and marketing.
9.
The S&OP plan cannot be developed by one supply-
chain link alone. We have identiﬁed other links that
should be involved, and you will be asked for your
input into this process.
10.
The S&OP is a critical planning step in our inventory
rightsizing efforts. It drives all the lower-level detailed
plans that follow.

160

Rightsizing Inventory
11.
Necessary guidelines for developing the S&OP exist
in the business plan. The S&OP is the tool used to
meet many management business objectives.
12.
The primary inputs to the S&OP plan are the sales
forecast of demand, inventory levels, and production
levels. Conceptually, they must be in balance.
13.
After developing the S&OP, it is compared for
resources that may take a long time to acquire. If we
don’t have the resources, one of two activities must
take place: either we have to get the resources to
meet the plan or we have to go back and change the
S&OP. Supply and demand must be in balance.
14.
We learned about inventory planning zones and will
develop and publish a document indicating the plan-
ning zones we will use, along with a set of standard
operating procedures.
15.
In addition to external customers, inventory demand
comes from many internal customers.
16.
We learned that the company business plan has many
inventory-related topics in it. If you haven’t seen it,
we will e-mail you a copy. Every supply-chain link
should be aware of the business plan details.
Attached to this e-mail is Figure 4.6, which is the latest
edition of our inventory rightsizing model, for your
review and comments. As always, I encourage you to
ask questions, provide ideas, and communicate our
progress to your team. We are also going to include a
status report in our company newsletter, along with pic-
tures of the various people involved in the inventory
effort. We have set up a meeting with human resources
to discuss the newsletter, which it is responsible for
publishing. Our next meeting is with planning and pur-
chasing; we anticipate many good ideas and action items
to result from that meeting. Thank you for your time.

Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
In this chapter, we have discussed the role and responsibilities of sales
and marketing and have introduced 11 new TIPS on how these two silos
can become part of a collaborative supply-chain network. Whereas sales
and marketing has a responsibility on the demand side of the supply-
chain equation, its actions (or inactions) have a signiﬁcant impact on the
supply side of the equation. All the TIPS, tools, and technologies in the
world will not help if the sales and marketing plans aren’t executed
effectively. Careful attention must be paid to these two important links.
TIP #44: Marketing has a direct and indirect impact on
inventory levels and strategy. Typically, the higher the
forecast (make-to-stock strategy), the higher the inventory
level. Marketing programs and budgets should be set in
proportion to inventory strategy.
Marketing plans and sales execution will cause inventory levels to rise
and fall on a daily basis. Although we place a great deal of emphasis on
these two silos, all other links in your supply chain have a vital role to
play that will affect the execution of sales and marketing plans. High
levels of inventory will hide a lot of problems in a make-to-stock supply-

chain strategy. Underselling the forecast will cause inventory levels to rise,
and when that happens:

Carrying costs go up because there is more inventory in stock.

Positive cash ﬂow will slow down because items in inventory will
turn at a slower rate.

Flexibility will decrease because you are using capacity to make
items you don’t need.

There will be rising pressure on sales to move the product.

Selling prices may decrease to move the product, and proﬁt margins
will suffer.
Overselling the forecast is not a good thing either. The inventory may
go down, and that brings in another set of problems:

Inventory stockouts can occur.

Customers will be upset and they may cancel orders if you are
late with delivery.

You can lose customers because of late delivery; once lost, it will
be difﬁcult to get them back.

You may pay premium prices to suppliers for raw materials that
have to be expedited.

You may incur premium freight charges for inbound raw materials
and outbound ﬁnished goods.

Breaking machine setups will decrease capacity and increase oper-
ating costs.

Because of the constant chaos, internal morale will suffer.

Manufacturing overtime may be needed, and this will increase
operating costs.
As you have learned in this chapter, balancing supply and demand
requires constant monitoring and adjustment. Although it appears to be
a “no win” situation, it doesn’t have to be. The forecast will rarely, if ever,
be perfect. Assuming that this statement is a fact, there are several things
you can do:
1.
Improve the accuracy and timing of information when change
occurs in the sales and marketing plans.
2.
Improve your ﬂexibility to change inventory levels in response to
the forecast change.
3.
If inventory levels increase because of an imbalance of supply and
demand, don’t wait until the end of an accounting period to deal
with it.

4.
Monitor budgets and plans weekly. Communicate budget and plan
results as soon as possible and report the results to all supply-
chain links.
TIP #45: Supply-chain links within a single supply chain
may have conﬂicting inventory goals and objectives. You
cannot rightsize your inventory until these conﬂicting
objectives are resolved and balanced.
To avoid these conﬂicting goals and objectives, take these important
actions:
1.
Use the sales and operations planning technique, discussed in this
chapter, and have all appropriate supply-chain links sign off on it.
It becomes an internal contract on which all links will perform.
2.
Align supply-chain performance metrics with the S&OP.
3.
Eliminate individual silo performance and reward programs, and
implement shared performance and reward programs within your
company.
This doesn’t mean eliminating the traditional checks and balances
necessary to run a business. These must continue in place. For example,
although establishing shared performance and reward programs for meet-
ing budgets and inventory goals is good, you still need ﬁnance to monitor
and report the conformance to these plans, no matter how good or bad
the results are.
TIP #46: The purpose of establishing inventory planning
zones is to recognize the degree of difﬁculty to make
changes, and to allow enough time for all supply-chain links
to react to the change in an economical, efﬁcient manner.
Planning zones will be covered in detail in Chapter 5, when we
discuss MPS. But planning zones must be considered when you develop
the S&OP also. Essentially, planning zones are used to identify a period
of time in your plan when changes to the plan cannot reasonably be
made. Because changes to the plan will impact so many areas of your
supply chain, companies also identify the level of authority required for
a change to take place. You can apply planning zones to your S&OP
as well. The S&OP process compares demand (orders and forecast) with
supply (production and distribution) and identiﬁes out-of-balance peri-
ods where you may have too much supply or too much demand, as
the case may be.

164

Rightsizing Inventory
In many cases, a period of time is required to bring the plans back
to balance. This time period should be identiﬁed as a zone. To illustrate
this, consider that today you are in month one, and the S&OP shows
that, starting from month ﬁve (period ﬁve of the S&OP), demand is going
to be greater than supply. If you decide that the solution is to add another
shift, you may need two to three months to hire and train people to
work on that shift. This gives you plenty of time. If, however, you decide
you need to build another plant, the time frame will not be acceptable,
and you would want some executive-level person making that decision.
So if it takes two years to add an additional plant and three months to
add a new shift, we are talking about two different zones and two levels
of authority. We will discuss planning zones in a different context in
Chapter 5.
TIP #47: Forecasting has a direct impact on inventory
levels. Overforecasting may cause inventory levels to
increase if it’s not sold, whereas underforecasting will
decrease inventory levels but may lead to stockouts.
Much of this TIP was covered in the discussion of TIP #44, but there
are several important points that will be made here. Selection of the right
forecasting tools and methodologies will have a positive impact on fore-
casting accuracy. A big challenge for many companies is in converting a
dollar forecast into a unit forecast and a product family forecast into a
unit forecast. Too often this conversion is left up to the operations link
to deal with and, more often than not, it is the master scheduler performing
this vital task. Forecasting accuracy can be improved by
1.
Sales and marketing taking a greater role in converting the dollar
and family forecasts into speciﬁc stockkeeping units
2.
Selection of a proven computer-based forecasting application
package
3.
Using accurate historical data as input to the software
4.
Applying sound and intuitive judgment to projected forecasting
results
5.
Getting forecasting input from customers
6.
Getting forecasting input from all links in the supply chain
7.

cussed in this chapter

Even after applying all these suggestions, there is a high probability
that the forecast versus actual sales will be out of balance. My contention
is that the best way to deal with the inevitable inaccuracy of forecasting
is to improve your ability to respond to changing conditions. The best
way to do this is to improve your supply-chain ﬂexibility. The company
that can respond to changing conditions quickly will help itself deal with
forecasting inaccuracy. This comment leads us directly to TIP #48.
TIP #48: The ability to rapidly respond to forecast changes
will greatly improve your ability to rightsize your inventory.
Increasing your supply-chain ﬂexibility will be a big asset in your
ability to rapidly respond to changes in forecast. Here are some suggestions
on how you can improve your ﬂexibility:
1.
Reduce machine setup time: This topic is covered in more detail
in Chapter 5 but, conceptually, if you can reduce your setup time,
you will improve your ﬂexibility. If it takes you eight hours to
setup a machine to run product A, production will want to run a
large batch of the product before changing the machine setup to
run product B. If, however, it only takes you three minutes to
change over to run product A, production will be more willing to
change the machine over to run product B. Under the long setup
scenario, you may be making a product that is not needed right
now, and you will be increasing inventory, inventory carrying costs
and, in theory, reducing capacity in your plant.
2.
Reduce lead time: If it takes you less time to make a product,
then you can move on to the next product more quickly. The
same is true for purchasing materials. If it takes you less time to
acquire needed material, not only will you reduce the need to
carry more inventory, but you will also improve your ﬂexibility by
ordering needed material more quickly.
3.
Improving supply-chain communication: At times, a complex
supply chain with many links is like an ocean liner out at sea.
Once it has decided to change course, it is a slow, time-consuming
process. Change in forecast usually starts at the furthest down-
stream link in the supply chain, and by the time information gets
from the furthest downstream link to the furthest upstream link,
much time has passed and unneeded inventory may be built. The
ability to communicate accurately and rapidly will greatly improve
your supply-chain ﬂexibility.

166

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #49: Selection and successful implementation of a
forecasting tool will greatly improve your chances of right-
sizing your inventory.
Although intuition and “gut feel” are important aspects of forecasting,
you will need a baseline forecast model to which you can then apply
your qualitative instincts. Most software packages on the market today
provide multiple forecasting models and techniques from which you can
choose. You will rely heavily on qualitative forecasting techniques when
historical, quantitative data is not available. Here are some suggestions
on how to apply this TIP:
1.
Get your IT link involved in the selection process.
2.
Select at least three suppliers to review their software in detail.
3.
Ask for product demonstrations.
4.
Give them some of your actual data to apply their models to.
5.
Visit/communicate with some of their customers (references) in a
like or similar line of business.
6.
Ask your suppliers and their customers the following types of ques-
tions: “What was the impact on inventory by using this software?”
TIP #50: All sources of demand must be considered when
planning for inventory supply and demand at the S&OP
level.
Actual customer orders are the most reliable and accurate input to the
S&OP process (unless they are in the habit of canceling them). But there
are many other sources of input that should be considered. Unless you
have the luxury of working with an order backlog of at least a year’s
worth of orders, you will need to forecast all future demands for your
products and services. The key word in this statement is all. Work with
all links in your supply chain to determine the total demand for your
products and services. Many companies and many industries have
demands for their products that go beyond the external customer. Some
were mentioned earlier in this chapter and are repeated here to reinforce
the reader’s learning experience:
1.
Actual customer orders
2.
Forecasted customer demand
3.
Intracompany demand (from other divisions of the company)
4.
Research and development (raw materials and ﬁnished goods)
5.
Product design (raw materials and ﬁnished goods)
6.
Quality control (quality assurance)

Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

167
7.
Destructive testing (cars)
8.
Free samples (pharmaceuticals, textiles)
9.
Marketing promotions (buy one, get one)
10.
Field service (spare parts)
11.
Company stores (employee discounts)
The above-mentioned inputs can be quantiﬁed, and a numerical value
(projection) can be placed on them.
TIP #51: The business plan is a major input to the S&OP
process; a realistic, achievable production plan cannot be
developed without knowing and following the guidelines
that are established in the business plan.
Besides the quantitative numbers mentioned in TIP #50, there are other
inputs to the S&OP process that are just as important, including business
plan considerations and restrictions:

Your company marketing strategy

Customer’s strategy and plans (CRM)

Supplier’s strategy and plans (SRM)

Your company’s resource strategy: people, plant, and equipment
(increase/decrease)

Your company’s inventory plans (aggregate decrease/increase)

Sourcing strategy: make/buy/3PL/4PL

Financing strategy

Manufacturing/distribution strategy
These inputs (and others) are just as important to the S&OP process
as the quantitative numbers. It is the management’s responsibility to see
that these inputs are communicated to the appropriate supply-chain links.
In my experience, this is one area that needs improvement in many
companies.
TIP #52: The production plan, as part of the S&OP pro-
cess, is an important tool that, if used correctly, can help
us rightsize our inventory.
The production plan section of the S&OP sets the overall production
rates for a product family over a relatively long planning horizon, in
monthly periods of time. This becomes the aggregate number of units
that should be produced for that product family. The actual production
of the individual items that make up that product family should not be

168

Rightsizing Inventory
greater than or less than the aggregate number. If you build more than
the aggregate number of units, inventory may increase; if you make less
than the aggregate number, the inventory may decrease. Of course, if
sales increase in the former example and decrease in the latter, inventory
change may be minimal.
The production plan sets the overall pace of production, and signiﬁcant
changes to the plan will have an impact on the business plan and
inventory, in particular. The entire supply chain is being driven by the
S&OP process, and if the S&OP changes, it must be communicated
immediately upstream and downstream through the entire supply chain.
Changes to the S&OP should only be made after receiving input from all
links impacted by the change.
TIP #53: Do not attempt to drastically reduce inventory
levels of active items until the impact on customer service
levels is understood by all links in the supply chain. Plan
to reduce inventory, then measure customer service per-
formance. If there is no negative impact on customer
service, plan to reduce inventory again.
The operative word in this TIP is active. If the inventory is inactive,
this TIP doesn’t apply. I deﬁne inactive inventory as inventory items with
no activity for 12 months or longer (unless you can justify keeping it). If
it’s inactive, get rid of it in a reasonable way that complies with GAAP
principles (legally and documented).
In the case of Woodstock Lighting Group, it has far too much ﬁnished
goods inventory of ﬂashlights. In this case, steps should be taken to reduce
the level of inventory. But as the TIP states, it should be a gradual process
and customer service levels should be watched. In an ideal situation you
should focus on reducing your raw material and manufacturing lead times,
and this can be coordinated with your inventory reduction efforts. Con-
ceptually, as you reduce lead times, you can reduce ﬁnished goods
inventory proportionately. The ideal would be zero lead time and zero
ﬁnished goods inventory.
TIP #54: The S&OP process plays a major role in your
inventory rightsizing efforts. All other steps in the inven-
tory planning process are guided by the inventory plan-
ning numbers established in the S&OP.
Technically speaking, the business plan drives the entire inventory
rightsizing effort. As a rule, it is rather general in nature and communicates
a lot of information in dollars at a very high level. The S&OP is really

Not Having Inventory Costs the Company Money

169
the ﬁrst opportunity to state inventory in terms of units, even though it
is at the family level. The S&OP process is gaining in popularity, and
there is now computer application software available that helps with the
process. Having said that, there are still a lot of manufacturing companies
out there that skip this part of the planning process.
The S&OP sets the guidelines on where inventory levels should be
throughout the S&OP planning horizon. Because of that, extra care and
effort should be spent in development of the important documents. All
supply-chain links should be involved in the process, and the results
should be reported and communicated to all supply-chain links.
What many companies do is take the sales forecast and go directly
into a build schedule, omitting the production-plan part of the S&OP
process. This is not a good idea. As stated earlier, the forecast is only
one input to the S&OP process. Using this approach also eliminates the
production-plan part of the S&OP, which is a vital link checking on
resource availability. Table 4.5 shows the latest status of the Woodstock
inventory, and Table 4.6 shows the inventory segmentation targets by
ABC classiﬁcation.

How Much Inventory 
Should We Make or Buy?
April 15, Harmony Team Meeting
Woodstock Inventory: $39.5 Million
My name is Cyndie and I am the materials manager for Woodstock
Lighting Group.
I wonder if this effort will require me to work more hours. I’m already
putting in ten hours a day, and my husband is starting to question me
whether it is worth the effort. Lately, he has been getting home earlier than
I do, has to pick up our daughter at day care, and cook dinner. He isn’t
happy about that, and I’m starting to feel the pressure. But with all the
downsizing going on in the manufacturing/distribution industries, I will
have a hard time ﬁnding a job that pays as well as this — if I can ﬁnd a
job at all. Besides, it is close to home, and my boss is real good about letting
me leave early to pick up the baby and take her to the doctor if she isn’t
feeling well. Lenny’s company is thinking of relocating out of state, and if
that happens I will have to ﬁnd a new job anyway. So, sooner or later I
will be out of this rat race. I better stop daydreaming and get back to work.
I hope the company is serious this time. It seems like every time a new fad
or buzzword comes out we get enthusiastic about it for a couple of months
or so. and then it just dies a slow death, or the person who is the champion
of the project leaves the company. I hope that doesn’t happen this time.

172

Rightsizing Inventory
How much inventory should we make/buy? That is the question we
struggle with every day. It seems I spend more time with Eddie in
purchasing than I do with my husband. I’m exaggerating of course, but
there are days when Eddie and I are in constant communication. As you
have heard from others, there are conﬂicting inventory-related objectives
within the company. Sales wants lots of ﬁnished goods inventory, pro-
duction wants lots of raw material inventory, and ﬁnance doesn’t want
any inventory! I guess you can say the biggest responsibility we have is
balancing these conﬂicting objectives and keeping everybody happy.
But, you know what? It shouldn’t be that way. We should all be in
agreement about what our inventory management goals and objectives
are. I realize this is exactly what the Harmony Team is trying to accomplish.
From what I’ve seen and heard so far, you are doing a great job. Inventory
is starting to come down and is being aligned with our strategy and our
customer’s strategy. We want to help also, and that’s why I’m here today.
I would like to give you a good understanding of our role and respon-
sibility and provide some insight into the tools we are currently using that
could be used more effectively than we use them today. I truly believe
that between purchasing and planning, we can be an important part of
the team effort to rightsize our inventory.
Role and Responsibilities
Our overall responsibility is to have the right inventory, in the right place,
at the right time, and in the right quantities to satisfy our customer and
company needs. That sounds pretty simple — but it’s not. We are con-
stantly replanning and changing things. I’ll talk more about that later. Let
me give you an overview of our tasks and activities:

Disaggregating the sales and operations plan (S&OP): As you
heard from sales and marketing, the S&OP is for product families,
and doesn’t tell us what speciﬁc end items to make. Our job is to
take the S&OP and break it down into speciﬁc products to man-
ufacture. We must ensure, however, that the sum of the items we
make in production is equal to the aggregate numbers in the S&OP.
The S&OP is for monthly periods of time, so we break it down
into speciﬁc weeks, because our planning is based on weekly
buckets of time. Again, the production we plan for on a weekly
basis must equal the monthly numbers in the S&OP. So you see,
the S&OP is the higher-level plan that we use to guide us on
overall production requirements.

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

173
TIP #55: The S&OP is the primary tool used to develop
inventory plans for producing, purchasing, and stocking
speciﬁc end products, spare parts, and subassemblies.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)

Master scheduling: Based on the S&OP, we create a plan called
the master production schedule (MPS). By deﬁnition, the MPS is
a statement of production. It indicates to our manufacturing plant
what products should be produced and when they should be
produced. For the Flashlight Division, we master schedule-speciﬁc
end items, like consumer ﬂashlights, commercial ﬂashlights, sport
ﬂashlights, night-glow ﬂashlights, and so forth. For the Spotlight
and Beacon Light Divisions, we develop the MPS for speciﬁc
subassemblies, such as strobe subassemblies, ﬂash strip subassem-
blies, etc.
TIP #56: The MPS disaggregates the numbers in the S&OP,
and the sum of the items in the MPS must be equal to the
product family numbers in the S&OP.

Material requirements planning (MRP): MRP is a technique that
helps us manage production and material priorities. It also helps
us determine what materials are needed, how much material is
needed, and when the material is needed. MRP gets its input from
the MPS. It is the primary tool used by Eddie and his team in
purchasing to place orders with our suppliers, and it provides us
in planning with the information we need to schedule and release
orders to our factory ﬂoor.

Capacity planning: MRP answers three questions about material
for us: what, how much, and when? It doesn’t answer the question,
“do we have the capacity in our plant to make it?” By deﬁnition,
capacity is our overall capability to manufacture product. By capa-
bility, I mean do we have the resources (people, machines, equip-
ment) to meet the MPS and MRP plans? We conduct two types of
capacity planning: rough-cut capacity planning (RCCP) and capac-
ity requirements planning (CRP). I’ll discuss this, along with the
other techniques, later on.

Other inventory scheduling/ordering techniques: We don’t
use MRP to plan for all materials. For some items, we use such
tools as “min/max” (minimum/maximum), order point, and a “two-
bin system.” We will review these methodologies also.

174

Rightsizing Inventory

Replanning: We spend about 70 percent of our time replanning
the MPS, MRP, RCCP, and CRP. Why? Because change is an inherent
part of our supply-chain process. Our ability (or inability) to
respond to change accurately and rapidly will determine our suc-
cess or failure as a company in rightsizing our inventory.
TIP #57: The ability to react to change in a rapid and
responsive manner will be a key to any inventory right-
sizing effort.
In a nutshell, these are the primary activities we perform. I should
point out that the sequence in which I presented our activities, from the
MPS to CRP, is the same sequence in which we plan. Figure 5.1 is a
ﬂowchart representing each step in the planning process.
You will note that there are arrows going back through the process
to indicate that this is a closed-loop planning process, which was explained
earlier. Different authors and textbooks present this ﬂow in slightly dif-
ferent ways, but all these variations cover the basic concepts we spoke
about here.
Replanning Because of Change
Supply chains are dynamic environments, so the one constant all supply
chains face is change. I believe this is one of the most important things
I am stressing today. If we are slow to change schedules and plans, we
will be making the wrong products and inventory may increase, shipments
to customers will be late, costs will go up, and production capacity will
be lost. I think it’s worth a few minutes to discuss the reasons for change:
1.
Customers cancel orders.
2.
Customers increase/decrease order quantities.
3.
Customers change requested ship date; sometimes they want it
earlier and sometimes they ask us to postpone delivery to a later date.
4.
Customers ask for a different product than originally ordered.
5.
Manufacturing has quality problems and product may have to be
reworked or scrapped.
6.
Manufacturing quantity produced may be different than the quan-
tity requested on the manufacturing work order.
7.
Manufacturing equipment breaks down and throws the schedule
out of sync.
8.
Manufacturing personnel are not available to perform a scheduled job.
9.
Inclement weather causes manufacturing to shut down.

I’ve only mentioned 20 reasons for the need to replan. I’m sure there
are many more that I didn’t mention. The point I’m trying to make is that
change will occur, there are many reasons for change, and dealing with
change is a big part of our job. This is why every link in our supply chain
must understand the role and responsibility of materials management.
When changes happen, we need to know immediately so that we can
adjust our plans accordingly. Too often, we hear about something that
happened weeks ago, and nobody told planning about it! That’s ridiculous
and it has to improve. I suggest we do three things to improve our supply-
chain communication about change:
1.
Develop and publish a list of changes that will require us to adjust
our plans (similar to the 20 items I discussed today).
2.
Document and publish a procedure to follow in the event a change
occurs (whom to contact regarding a speciﬁc type of change).
3.
Develop timelines to communicate the change (i.e., machine break-
down: notify within one hour or sooner; customer order change
in zone two: notify within ﬁve days or sooner).
I also think it would be a good idea to keep track of the types of
changes that occur so that we can detect any pattern or trend. We might
need to focus on those and get to the root cause of the change. We will
also need to educate all employees on why communicating about a change
is so important.
TIP #58: Develop, document, and communicate a proce-
dure to be followed when changes occur. Educate all
employees on the importance of communicating changes
to the proper links in the supply chain.

Master Production Scheduling
I personally believe master scheduling is the single most important
activity we do. It is the foundation driving all other plans that cause us
to buy or make inventory. What plan is more important than that?
Although the S&OP sets the direction and overall production levels, it
doesn’t tell us which items in a product family to make, and that’s an
important part of our job. Many manufacturing companies use an MPS.
They may not call it master scheduling; some companies call it produc-
tion planning. According to APICS, the term production plan is synon-
ymous with S&OP. But there are still a lot of companies that refer to
the production plan as a statement of what they will manufacture. Figure
5.2 depicts the relationship of S&OP to MPS. Some companies use the
sales forecast as a direct input to the MPS, and others use the S&OP
process step.
Although the S&OP sets the overall guidelines for MPS, the actual
inputs come from many sources. Not all companies have the same inputs.
Figure 5.3 shows some of the primary inputs to MPS.

Rightsizing Inventory
Actual Customer Orders
Of all the inputs to the MPS process, who could argue that actual customer
orders aren’t the best inputs? I would think that make-to-order companies
would have a higher percentage of actual customer orders than a make-
to-stock company. But even a make-to-order company may have other
inputs to the MPS process. A good example would be a company that
manufactures capital equipment and also has a service department that
sells/installs spare parts for its machines, similar to our Beacon Light
service link.
Those spare parts would have to be scheduled also. In Woodstock,
we master-schedule actual customer orders for the Beacon Light and
Spotlight divisions: We also master-schedule subassemblies of spare parts.
For the Flashlight Division, we master-schedule to forecast, because the
lead time to make our products is greater than the delivery lead time
given to us by the customer. But as a general rule, master-scheduling real
customer orders is the best input to MPS. We do have to be careful though.
I have known instances in which the customer gave us an actual order
and we went ahead and built the product, only to have the customer
cancel the order. Because this was an important customer, we canceled
the order as requested and got stuck with the inventory. In fact, I think
we still have the product in inventory and if I’m not mistaken it was about
a $10,000 order. That reminds me, I want to check the inventory records

to see if it’s still in stock. We just received a new order from a different
customer and I believe the product specs are similar. Maybe I can get the
sales team to substitute that product for the new order. I realize that this
was an exception — or was it? Does anyone keep track of this? If so, can
we get a copy of that report?
Forecast
If the nature of your business is that your customer delivery-requested
lead time is less than the time it takes you to manufacture the product,
then you have a choice:

Reduce the manufacturing lead time to something less than the
customer-requested lead time, or carry inventory in stock.
As I said before, our Flashlight Division has this problem. It is impos-
sible for it to make the product in a shorter lead time than the delivery
lead time, so it has to build inventory in advance of actual customer
orders. In this case, we rely heavily on the forecast. And as you heard
from Rudy, “The one thing right about our forecast is that it is always
wrong.” I don’t know statistically how wrong (maybe Rudy told you), but
if you were to ask me to guess, I would bet it is about 60 percent to 70
percent accurate for the Flashlight Division and about 75 percent to 80
percent accurate for the other two divisions. Pretty bad, right?
That’s one thing I would like to see: the actual sales to forecast numbers
every month. Can you guys see to it that those forecast to actual numbers
are published every month? We don’t want the numbers so that we can
point ﬁngers and blame the other links; we want the numbers so that we
can adjust the MPS accordingly. The forecasting inaccuracy works both
ways. Sometimes the forecast is higher than actual sales, and in that case
we are making the wrong things, building inventory, and wasting capacity.
Sometimes the forecast is lower than actual sales, and in that case
we have to scramble to get the order completed. We call these orders
impact orders, because they impact the whole supply chain. Purchasing,
in particular, gets hit hard when we get an impact order. It has to
pressure suppliers to get “stuff” in early (which doesn’t help our supplier
relationships). It may have to pay a premium to the supplier if the
supplier has to break down a machine and do another machine setup.
To add salt to the wound, it may have to pay a premium for airfreighting
the materials in.
It also impacts our manufacturing plant staff. They may have to do
additional machine setups and put aside other jobs they were working
on. One of the issues the Harmony Team should look at is the total cost

180

Rightsizing Inventory
to the company of disrupting the MPS with a rush order. In fact, I will
take that as an action item and do it myself. The very next impact order
we get, I will look at the total cost to the company from schedule
disruption. To prevent constant changes to the MPS, many manufacturing
companies establish planning zones with different levels of authority
required to make changes. Let me explain this in detail because I think
it is something Woodstock should do.
Inventory Planning Zones
I know I’ve spoken a lot about making changes to the MPS and how
important rapid response is in today’s marketplace, but realistically, some
changes are easier to make than others. All plans, whether they are the
S&OP, MPS, or MRP/CRP, have realistic periods where change to a plan
will be difﬁcult and costly to make, and the effect on inventory can be
huge. Change and its impact will vary industry by industry and company
by company.
Our MPS is for weekly periods of time with a planning horizon of one
year. The general rule is that the MPS planning horizon should go as far
out into the future as our longest cumulative lead-time product, so that
long-lead-time items can be acquired in a timely manner. Figure 5.4
illustrates three separate zones in the MPS.
A planning zone is a block of time in the planning process where it
is reasonable, or not reasonable, to make changes to the plan. In my
example, zone 1 is the closest in time, on the far left of this chart. This
represents the current week and the next two weeks after this one.
Changes to the plan in zone 1 will be costly to make because resources
have been committed. Chances are we’ve already bought the raw materials,
assigned resources (people and equipment), and booked actual customer
orders. The only changes that should be allowed in zone 1 are emergency
changes approved by Joe or Adriana.

Zone 2 is represented by the next three weeks. In this zone (weeks
four through six), changes are typically less costly to make. There may
be enough time to reschedule machines, and raw materials may be
rescheduled for another time. In zone 2, changes to the MPS may be
made by Rudy, Arnie, or me.
Zone 3 is represented by the remainder of the planning horizon,
which goes out the remainder of the year. In zone 3, changes, if justiﬁed,
may be made by operating personnel as long as the change is within
the guidelines established by our management team consisting of Adriana
and Joe.
Obviously, the cost of change will be higher in zone 1 (the no-change
zone) than it will be in zone 3 (the any-change zone). For now, I will
look at the impact on costs in zone 1 only. I will report my ﬁndings back
to the team in a couple of weeks, if not sooner.
TIP #59: Changes to the MPS in zone 1 can increase costs
and inventory levels. Changes in zone 1 should be kept
to a minimum and analyzed for the total impact to the
supply chain.
TIP #60: Every time an unplanned order (impact order) is
expedited into the schedule, another order (or more)
should be de-expedited.
Other Independent Demand Items
I want to explain an important principle of inventory management:
dependent demand versus independent demand items. Independent
demand items are those items where demand for the item is unrelated
to the demand for other items. A ﬁnished product, such as our small
standard ﬂashlight (sold as a unit of one to a package), is a good example
of independent demand. When you look at the BOM in Figure 5.5, you
will note that item #5867 is the ﬁnished product and there is no other
demand in the BOM higher than item #5867. The same is true for item
#52969. Therefore, the demand for item #5867 and item #52969 is
independent of any other demand, and demand for them must be
forecast.
On the other hand, a dependent demand item is related to the demand
for another item. In Figure 5.6, the demand for parts #6167, #22596, #7250,
and the light kit #103139 is related to the higher-level demand for item
#5867. The demand for these parts is dependent on the demand for the
ﬁnished ﬂashlight #5867, and the demand for them can be calculated.

182

Rightsizing Inventory
For example, if the forecast (independent demand) for item #5867 is
for 1000 units, then the demand for part #7250 is 2000 units (batteries),
because it requires two units of part #7250 for every item #5867 made.
Based on this example, we can say that the demand for item #5867 is
unknown and needs to be forecast, whereas the demand for part #7250
is dependent on the demand of item #5867 and can be calculated.
Now, here is a good question: Can an item have both dependent and
independent demand? The answer is yes, it can. You will see this
illustrated in Figure 5.6, where item #5867 is now an independent item

sold as part of a two-ﬂashlight set made up of one large ﬂashlight and
one smaller ﬂashlight.
The two-piece set, item #10542, is made up of item #5867 and item
#52969. So in this example, item #5867 is dependent on the demand
for item #10542 and can be calculated. Based on this example, we
would master-schedule items #5867 and #52969 (when made to be
sold as a single unit), and item #10542 (where item #5867 and #52969
are sold as part of a two-piece set). Later on, when we get to MRP,
we will see that the lower-level demands can be calculated and
summarized together.
All independent demand must be considered. We also run product
promotions where we have a “buy one, get one” deal that we offer to
our large retail customers. Although this is not a forecast sale so to speak,
we still have to manufacture and ship the product even though it is not
considered an item sold for proﬁt. We also donate ﬂashlights to various
nonproﬁt organizations that use the ﬂashlights to improve the quality of
life for others. In our beacon light product line, we sell a ﬁnished beacon
light that has a lens and prism set as part of its dependent demand.
However, the lens and prism set is also sold as a replacement part, and
thus has independent demand. I’m sure you can think of others, but I
believe you get the point.
Restrictions and Limitations
Surprisingly, the MPS is used for other purposes beyond scheduling
requirements. It is also a tool that can be used to control inventory levels,
production levels, customer service levels, and capacity levels. Many of
these restrictions and limitations can be found in the business plan. The
business plan is the document in which companies state their strategy for
the future, both short-term (one year) and long-term (three to ﬁve years).
I am amazed by the fact that many people in our company don’t know
what is in the business plan. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve spoken
to who don’t know. Just in case some of you don’t know, I will highlight
some of the points in the business plan that affect the MPS, and inventory
in particular.

There is a hiring freeze for this ﬁscal year. This means we won’t
be able to hire any more direct labor personnel in the plant, which
in turn impacts our ability to increase our capacity.

Although the plan doesn’t call for plant layoffs this year, it does
state that if people leave the company we will not replace them
this year. This means not only will we not increase our capacity,
but we may in fact have reduced capacity because of attrition.

184

Rightsizing Inventory

There is no budget this year to purchase new capital equipment.
The lead time to acquire new equipment is long, typically six
months, and it will impact our capacity in the second half of the
year (that is if we need it).

The business plan calls for an overall inventory reduction of 20
percent of the total inventory value at the end of the year. Because
the inventory was $40 million at the end of the year, this means
inventory needs to be reduced by $8 million. How many of our
employees know that?

The business plan calls for increasing customer service levels by
5 percent over last year without increasing inventory levels. Now
that’s an interesting challenge.
I suggest as an action item that we cull out of the business plan all
inventory-related topics and distribute them to all supply-chain managers
so they can communicate what’s in the plan to their team.
TIP #61: The contents of the business plan related to
inventory management activities should be communicated
to all supply-chain employees who have an impact on
achieving those goals and objectives.
I heard that Rudy explained to you how the S&OP could be used to
reduce inventory levels; it is also true of the MPS. Remember, the sum of
the items in the MPS must be equal to the product family total in the
S&OP. Thus, it is a more detailed, item-by-item inventory reduction.
The MPS is also a tool that can help in establishing customer service
levels. If you want to have a high level of customer service, one way to
do this is to make more than is required for immediate use. This is
particularly true for our ﬂashlight products, which we make to stock. For
example, if there is a high degree of uncertainty with the forecast, we
may build more ﬂashlights than the forecast calls for. Building extra
inventory (safety stock) is the most desirable way to improve customer
service. Until we get our act together and reduce our lead times to make
the product, we will have to get approval from management, because it
will be more than the S&OP shows in the aggregate. Who wants to explain
this to management? I’ve just told you it wants to decrease inventory and
increase customer service at the same time. What planet do these guys
come from?
Developing and maintaining the MPS is an iterative process that never
ends because of constant change. We redo our MPS weekly, usually on
a Monday after the production meeting, when we review the results of

the MRP computer run (which is done every Sunday) and look at our
capacity.
Rough-Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP) and Capacity 
Requirements Planning (CRP)
The second step in the master scheduling process is taking a look at our
capacity. We do this today by using spreadsheets. You would be surprised
to learn how many companies pay all that money for sophisticated
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and use spreadsheets for
capacity planning. For now, this is the best we can do. There are two
computer-based techniques available to us, but we don’t use them today.
It is not my intent today to go into the details of RCCP and CRP, but
let me at least provide you with deﬁnitions. There are plenty of great
books written on capacity management, and I will be happy to provide
you with references.

Rough-cut capacity planning: This is the process of comparing
the requirements of the MPS to the available capacity at our critical
work centers. To us it would be our bottleneck work center (our
CNC machines) and our gateway work center (our ﬁrst operation
at our ﬁrst work center — compounding). The theory is that, if
we don’t have the capacity at our bottleneck work center and our
gateway work center, why bother looking at all the rest of them?
This doesn’t mean that we don’t have a need to look at all work
centers because we are merely talking about the ﬁrst review of
capacity. The capacity at all other work centers has to be aligned
to our bottleneck and gateway work center. Once we do that, we
can look at all work centers using CRP.

Capacity requirements planning: CRP is a detailed review com-
paring the planned requirements (workload) to the capacity at all
work centers. I say all work centers, but in reality we don’t have
to look at all operations in detail. Whereas RCCP gives us some
idea of the capacity available, CRP will provide more detail that
may show capacity is not available at certain times.
Why is comparing the MPS to capacity so important to inventory
management? For one thing, if capacity at a downstream work center is
less than the capacity at the upstream work center feeding it work, work-
in-process (WIP) inventory will build up at the downstream work center
and potentially we could have late work orders. If you remember, our
WIP inventory was $7.5 million at the end of the year. If we can balance

186

Rightsizing Inventory
(rightsize) our workload in the plant, work center to work center, then
we have an opportunity to decrease the inventory buffer, which will
reduce our overall inventory levels.
This balancing of load to capacity is an iterative process and requires
constant attention. I suggest we talk to IT about activating the RCCP and
CRP capabilities in our ERP system, so that we can stop using homegrown
spreadsheets that take so much time to develop and execute. After all,
time is money, and our time will be better spent on analyzing the data
provided by these systems, rather than developing the data in a home-
grown fashion.
TIP #62: Balancing workload (MPS) with available capac-
ity is an important step in rightsizing inventory levels in
the supply chain.
Creating the Master Production Schedule
I have brought a copy of our most recent MPS to show you. You will
note that Figure 5.7 shows the MPS for item #10542, the two-piece
ﬂashlight set I spoke of earlier. The demand comes from our forecast,
because this is a make-to-stock item. I have dropped three zeros to make
it easier to read. For example, the demand in period 1 is actually 50,000.
As of Friday evening, we had 90 in stock. Because we are making this
product well in advance of the needed date, no safety stock is required.


187
Every time we make this product, we make it in lot sizes of 100. I don’t
know how cost accounting and manufacturing engineering came up with
this lot size number, but for now we have to live with it. We only make
this product for six weeks out of the year, so this will be our entire
production for the year.
We do this because this is a tough setup and takes one full shift to
accomplish. Once the machine is set up to run, we want to make as many
as possible. This is a terrible approach to planning production. Because
much of this stock isn’t needed until later in the year, I have been arguing
with Joe to defer the ﬁnal assembly until later in the sales cycle. This
technique of “postponement” will prevent us from committing to the ﬁnal
conﬁguration. We can stock them as item #5867 and item #52969 (see
Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.6).
If the actual orders are less than the forecast, we can still sell them as
single units without the additional cost of breaking down the conﬁguration
or selling them at a discount. These are two of our standard products,
and we always sell a lot of them. Unfortunately, Joe is of the mindset to
make them and be done with it. This is not a good approach, and I’ve
told him so. Maybe you can convince him.
Because I don’t think Joe is going to budge on this topic, I think you
should talk to manufacturing engineering staff and ask them to focus on
reducing the machine setup time. If we can ﬁnd a way of dramatically
reducing setup time, we would make smaller lots at a time and build
them more often and closer to the actual date, rather than absorbing the
high cost of carrying inventory.
TIP #63: Reducing machine setup time will allow for pro-
ducing smaller batches of inventory more frequently and
will help reduce the amount of inventory carried in stock.
Now back to our example. Assume we had 90 units in stock on Friday
evening when we went home and period 1 is Monday to Friday of the
following week. This continues for a total of six weeks. I can give you
a formula, but I would like you to think out the math logically. If we had
90 in stock on Friday and need 50 in week 1 for demand, then we will
have 40 left in stock on Friday evening. Do we have to schedule any
new stock for week 1? The answer is no.
If we have 40 in stock at the end of week 1 and need 70 for demand
in week 2, do we have enough? No, we have 40 and need 70, so we will
be short by 30 units. We can’t build 30 units because of lot-size rules; we
will have to make 100. If we make 100 and have 40 in stock, we will
have a total of 140 for the week. We need 70 for demand, so that at the
end of week 2 we will have 70 in stock.

188

Rightsizing Inventory
This scenario of master scheduling continues throughout the planning
horizon and results in an MPS. I have kept it simple because it is not my
intent to teach you how to do it but rather to show you how the process
impacts inventory levels. There are other considerations. For example, I
haven’t included safety stock as a planning rule. If I said we had to have
safety stock of 50 units, then we would have needed to build 100 in
period 1, because the ending inventory at the end of period 1 was only
40 units, which is 10 below safety stock. I also didn’t discuss lead times.
If the lead time for this product were 3 weeks, then we couldn’t build
the 100 units needed in period 2 in time. We would have to expedite this
lot. I strongly suggest that we review all lot-size rules and operate under
the philosophy that the goal is to make a lot size of 1 unit. Of course,
this isn’t realistic, but it is a goal to strive for.
TIP #64: Constantly review and update your lot-size rules
with a hypothetical goal of reducing all lot sizes to one.
TIP #65: The MPS must be realistic and achievable. If not,
inventory will increase and customer service will decrease
over time.
Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
MRP isn’t for everyone, and even those companies that use MRP don’t
use it for all items in their product line. Having said that, I believe MRP
is an important tool and, if used properly, it can help us rightsize our
inventory. I say that because even though we are using it I know for a
fact that it is causing more problems than it is solving.
Let me start by providing you with a simple deﬁnition of MRP. It is
a technique to calculate requirements for materials used in production.
You don’t need a computer to do it. My father was using MRP 40 years
ago and didn’t know it was called MRP for a long time. He used paper
and pencil (and a lot of erasers!). He told me by the time he had
ﬁnished it, it was outdated and he had to start all over again. What an
exercise in frustration! So although it can be done with paper and
pencil, it isn’t practical or effective unless you are only planning for
one or two simple parts.
Today, MRP is an application software that is part of an ERP computer
system. It would be almost impossible and unrealistic to do it manually.
We use the computer because it would be more timely and accurate than
if we did it manually.
Figure 5.8 shows all the major MRP inputs and outputs. MRP answers
three important scheduling questions for us:

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

1.
What parts/ingredients do we need to make or buy?
2.
How many of those parts/ingredients do we need to make or buy?
3.
When do we need to make or buy those parts/ingredients?
The answers to these questions have a major impact on our inventory
levels. Let me quickly review the major inputs to MRP and explain why
we are having difﬁculties with it.
MRP Logical Sequence
It isn’t possible for me to teach you how to perform MRP in the brief
time allocated to me today. But I would like to show you how it works.
Don’t focus on the math; focus on what the math is trying to accomplish.
I recommend that personnel in all supply-chain links receive education
on how MRP works.
We will use two different ﬁnished items that use the same battery,
item #5867 and item #52969. Logically, the very ﬁrst thing MRP needs to

know is what to build; this comes from the MPS. You will notice in Figure
5.10 that we will require 100 units each in periods 2, 4, and 6 of item
#5867, and 100 units each in periods 1, 3, 5, and 6 of item #52969. It is
a given in this example that this input comes from MPS.
Now that MRP knows what to make, it next needs to know what parts
and how many of each go into each of the two items. For simplicity, we
will focus only on the battery, part #7250. Each part #5867 requires two
D batteries and each part #52969 requires three D batteries.
Figure 5.6, explained earlier, shows a single-level BOM for each of
the two ﬂashlights. The highest level of a BOM is identiﬁed as the 0
level. The level immediately below it is called level 1. The battery is at
level 1. Why is this so important? It is because MRP will review the
material requirements level by level, starting with the 0 level and then
reviewing the requirements at level 1 and so on, until it gets to the
bottom of the BOM.
This is to ensure that all requirements for an item are captured in the
sequence and quantity identiﬁed in the BOM. We are not going to plan
for item #10542 in this example:
What independent items do we need to make? Because part
#5867 and part #52969 are at the 0 level in their BOMs, they are
the independent items.
What dependent items go into each item? The BOM, as shown
in Figure 5.6, shows all the components that go into these two
items, and the quantity required to make one ﬂashlight. For every
part #5867, we require two batteries, and for every part #52969
we require three batteries. Using part #5867 as an example, the
MRP logic says that because we need to build 200 (planned order
release) during this 6-week period, and each one uses two batteries,
we will need a total of 400 batteries. This technique (calculation)
is called a BOM explosion.
Independent demand quantity needed ×
dependent demand quantity
Part #5867: 200 × 2 = 400
Part #52969: 250 × 3 = 750
Total batteries required: 400 + 750 = 1150
Likewise for part #52969, we need to build 250 (planned order
release), and each one requires 3 batteries, so the total number of

Rightsizing Inventory
batteries required is 750. Note that the gross requirements for part
#7250 are shown by period in Figure 5.10.
Do we have any inventory in stock on part #7250? MRP will
look to see how much is in inventory, if any. In Figure 5.9, you
will note that we have 1200 (OH) in stock.
Do we have any on order? The scheduled receipt line in the grid
doesn’t show any batteries due in. (Note: on the top of Figure 5.9
we have a scheduled receipt for part #5867 of 50 due in period
1.) A scheduled receipt is an actual order and is scheduled to arrive
in stock in the period shown.
After satisfying demand will we have any inventory left? Even
if the answer is “yes, there will be some left in stock,” MRP will
ask another question.
Does the inventory remaining satisfy the safety stock require-
ment? If the answer to this question is yes, then the MRP system will
post the inventory balance in the projected available balance column.
How much do we have to make (or buy if it’s a purchased
item) to satisfy demand or safety stock requirements? If, at
any point during the previous two questions, MRP calculates a
negative number, the system will tell us we have a net requirement.
This means we must make some to satisfy the demand or safety
stock requirements before we can calculate the projected available
balance (PAB). The PAB must be a positive number.
When should I receive it into inventory? So now MRP says, “If
you have a net requirement, you should plan on receiving some
(planned order receipt) in period n.”
When should I release the order? For example, Figure 5.10
shows 500 batteries should be received into stock in period 4, and
the lead time to acquire the part is 3 weeks. The “planned order
release” is in week 1, so that it will arrive into stock in week 4 (3
weeks later). The difference between the planned order receipt,
and the planned order release dates is called the “lead time offset.”
MRP Makes Recommendations
It’s important to note that MRP doesn’t automatically release orders to the
factory ﬂoor or suppliers. MRP makes recommendations. It is up to us in
the planning department to decide whether to execute the MRP recom-
mendations. Our MRP system makes such recommendations as:

Release an order

Cancel an order

There may be others, but these are the primary recommendations that
we look at. MRP runs over the weekend, so every Monday morning we
get together with Joe and Eddie in purchasing to review these recommen-
dations and decide which ones to execute.
The Power of MRP
The real power of MRP is that it will combine requirements for the same
part used in different products and at different levels in the BOM. Although
this calculation could be done manually, it is almost impossible to do
because of the number of calculations required. Not only will the computer
do it faster, but it will also do it more accurately. Doing it by hand is
bound to cause errors.
TIP #66: Executing the recommendations of MRP will have
a signiﬁcant impact on inventory rightsizing efforts.
Data Integrity and MRP
MRP only works well if the data used for the calculations is accurate. This
is where we are having our problems, and one of the biggest reasons
why our inventory is out of balance and too high. There are four areas
that we need to address to run MRP effectively:
1.
Inventory accuracy: As you know, our inventory accuracy is some-
where around 88 percent. This is terrible. The inventory gurus will
tell you that for MRP to work effectively, inventory accuracy must be
in the neighborhood of 98 percent to 99 percent. Of course, the goal
should be 100 percent. As you can see, we are way off. As a result,
we are making things we don’t need, and not making things we do
need. There is no way we can rightsize our inventory without improv-
ing our inventory accuracy. We have begun to cycle-count our inven-
tory. I’ll leave it to our distribution team to discuss this with you.
TIP #67: Inventory accuracy must be in the 98 percent to
100 percent range for MRP to function successfully. It will
be almost impossible to rightsize inventory without this
level of inventory accuracy.

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

2.
Bill of material (BOM) accuracy: I don’t know how accurate our
BOMs are. When you meet with the product design group staff
you can ask them. This is one area where I think we function very
well, because I don’t get a lot of complaints about inaccurate
BOMs. Similar to inventory, our BOMs should be perfect and 100
percent accurate. We should review our engineering change notice
(ECN) procedure to ensure that our BOMs are kept up to date.
Before I forget, and this doesn’t have anything to do with BOM
accuracy, it would really help get rid of some inventory if design
engineering were to provide us with a list of item/part substitutes.
There are times when we wait for a part to come in from a supplier
but have a part in stock that can be substituted without impacting
the end item’s form, ﬁt, or function.
TIP #68: Have design engineering review the current
inventory and provide a list of parts that can be used to
substitute for the primary part as long as it can meet the
criteria of form, ﬁt, and function.
3.
Manufacturing and purchasing lead time: This is a real problem
area for us. Lead times are a dynamic and ever-changing environ-
ment. Inaccurate lead times are causing us to make/buy products
too early or too late. In either case, this is creating increased
inventory levels and stockouts. We are wasting valuable capacity
on making some products when they aren’t needed until a later
date. In other cases, we are starting setup or ordering material later
than we should and have to go into an expedite mode to get the
part on time. If it is a purchased part, we may have to ﬂy it into
our plant at a premium airfreight rate. This is equally unacceptable.
I propose we establish an operating policy of determining when
lead times should be changed in our MRP system. We should review
all lead times (manufactured parts and purchased parts) once a
quarter and make the necessary changes in our system. We should
also have a policy where, if a lead time changes by ﬁve days or
more, the change should be made immediately rather than waiting
for the quarterly review. Is ﬁve the right number? I don’t know,
but it is a starting point; we can decrease it if that is working for us.
TIP #69: Inaccurate purchasing and manufacturing lead
times have a signiﬁcant impact on inventory levels and
require constant review and updating. An operating policy
must be in place to ensure that lead times are current and
up to date.

Rightsizing Inventory
4.
Lot-size rules: We should also review our lot-size rules for all
items, both purchased and manufactured parts. For the most
part, I believe our MRP system operates with the lot-for-lot rule.
This means that MRP will recommend only what is required to
satisfy demand and safety stock. However, there may be some
parts in the system that use the ﬁxed-lot-size rule. This means
that every time there is a requirement, MRP will recommend a
ﬁxed lot size that we entered into the system. In the case of our
internal manufacturing, the ﬁxed lot size was determined by our
cost accounting and manufacturing engineering teams. They set
this lot size based on certain parameters such as setup times,
ﬁxed costs, and associated overhead. In the case of purchased
parts, the lot size is set by the supplier. You have heard from
others how ﬁxed lot sizes can cause our inventory to get out of
balance and hinder our inventory rightsizing efforts. We should
review all ﬁxed-lot-size rules to see if we can change them to
lot-for-lot. We will get a lot of grief from manufacturing over
this because of some of the long machine setup times we have.
But reducing setup times is one of the goals of the Harmony
Team, isn’t it?
TIP #70: Lot-size rules have a signiﬁcant impact on inven-
tory levels and should be reviewed and updated con-
stantly. An operating policy must be in place to ensure
this happens.
As you can see we have a lot of work to do in this area. Data integrity
is probably one of the biggest reasons that MRP fails in a lot of companies.
If we improve the accuracy in these four areas, I know we can reduce
inventory levels dramatically. We must get our data accurate and have
operating policies in place to sustain the high level of accuracy required.
As I said earlier, MRP isn’t for everyone and shouldn’t be used for all
items we make or buy.
There are other ordering techniques we use such as minimum/maxi-
mum (min/max), order point, and the two-bin system. We will discuss
these at another time. What is very important is that the four areas of
data integrity apply to everything our supply chain does and should be
taken very seriously.
TIP #71: The four areas of data integrity don’t just apply
to MRP; these four areas are important to all links in the
supply chain.

I hope they really understand what I’ve said about data integrity.
Without ﬁxing these areas our inventory rightsizing efforts are doomed to
failure. I get frustrated when we run into problems because of inaccurate
information, and I really have a hard time understanding why we haven’t
done anything about it or only make a half-hearted effort to ﬁx it.
Purchasing
Eddie couldn’t make it today. He is down in Englewood, Florida, checking
out houses for his retirement; lucky him. As I’ve said before, I spend a
lot of time with Eddie and have a good understanding of what goes on
there, so I can give the team a good idea of what its issues are. Figure
5.11 shows purchased material as the highest element of COGS. Control-
ling purchased material costs is an important part of our inventory
rightsizing efforts.
Role and Responsibilities
As with most purchasing organizations, the purchasing department of
Woodstock is responsible for buying the right product at the right time,
in the right quantity, in the right quality, at the right cost, and from the
right supplier. However, because of the global marketplace and advent
of the Internet, this has taken on a new meaning. Supplier information
is just a mouse click away. That’s the good news. The bad news (if you
consider time) is that there is so much information out there it can become
overwhelming. We are constantly looking for new suppliers who can
satisfy all six of the “rights.”
Unfortunately, purchasing here at Woodstock spends 95 percent of its
time expediting materials it has already purchased, rather than ﬁnding and

Rightsizing Inventory
nurturing new suppliers who can become long-term partners. I’ll share
with you the issues our purchasing department faces on a daily basis:
1.
Constant changes to purchase orders: As soon as we give a
purchase order to a supplier we ask to change something on it;
usually, the request date and order quantity. As I mentioned before,
our MRP system is inaccurate, so we are constantly giving our
supplier inaccurate data. I have actually seen purchase orders
where we changed the requested date three or four times, only to
go back to the original request date. This doesn’t give us much
credibility with our suppliers.
2.
Too much paperwork: Current company policy dictates that we
issue hard paper copies of purchase orders and amendments to
purchase orders. This is a full-time job for two people on our
purchasing staff who do nothing else except type, amend, mail,
and ﬁle purchase orders. This is absolutely crazy. This is a non-
value-added activity and should be eliminated.
We must move to an electronic purchasing system. Eddie has
been speaking with the IT team about this. The problem is that
IT has a backlog of requests, and doesn’t know when it can get
to it. One thing is for sure: It’s not in the budget for this year.
Please help us by discussing this with IT members when you meet
with them. We’ve got to ﬁnd the budget to do this.
3.
Late payments: We are constantly late paying our suppliers. We
are supposed to pay most of our suppliers in 30 days, but on
average we are running about 45 days. In rare cases, we are over
60 days past due. How can we expect our suppliers to cooperate
when we are not living up to our end of the bargain? This is a
real credibility problem for us. This also causes problems for us
when we try to enlist new suppliers. You know that they are
checking our credit rating. We had one new supplier who recently
refused to give us credit and requested COD (cash on delivery)
terms. How embarrassing!
4.
Just-in-time (JIT) delivery: We have read so much about JIT
deliveries where suppliers deliver their product several times a week
and in some cases several times a day. I hate to say, “this won’t
work for us,” because that’s not a positive attitude and goes against
the principles of change management. We have tried to implement
this with several suppliers and they wanted to increase the purchase
price to do it. Unfortunately, they said we don’t buy enough
products in large quantities from them to make it worth their while,
without charging a premium. I think we should revisit this.

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

199
We have one item, an injected molded part, which we do buy
a fairly substantial amount of from a local supplier. We currently
carry about $500,000 of inventory in stock. We should look into
developing a partnership to see if we can get the supplier to deliver
on a JIT schedule. We should conduct a cost-beneﬁt analysis to
see if it would be beneﬁcial to pay a premium for JIT deliveries.
Like any other contract, there must be a beneﬁt to both parties so
that it is a win-win situation for both. I’ll start to look at this with
Eddie when he gets back.
5.
Erratic lead times: The product is arriving late all the time. We
can’t predict when the material will show up. Suppliers don’t tell
us if they are going to be late. This really messes up our production
schedule and causes us to be late on orders. This is one of the
reasons we carry so much safety stock and why our MRP system
doesn’t work well.
We can’t follow up on every purchase order to see if it’s on
time. We process over 5000 purchase orders a year, and it isn’t
practical to do so. We need to implement a purchase order policy
where suppliers must notify us if they are going to be more than
three days late. The difﬁcult part will be to get the suppliers to
do this. I think we can do this with some of our key suppliers
where we spend a lot of money.
I recommend we establish a “supplier” day, when we bring in
the key suppliers and give them some insights into our business.
We should also show them our manufacturing processes, have
them meet with our management and, in general, explain to them
why it’s important that they be on time with their delivery, and
request them to let us know in advance if they will be late. I think
this proactive communication will help.
6.
Excessive overshipments: I don’t know if it’s industry practice
or not, but our purchase order agreement says that suppliers can
ship 10 percent more or less on an order. So naturally, what do
some of them do? They constantly overship by 10 percent. If they
do this with every customer, they are literally increasing their sales
by 10 percent. I wish we could do it. Hey, maybe we do! I’ll have
to ask Rudy. Anyway, we should identify the suppliers who do
this all the time and place orders for 10 percent less than we need,
because they will overship and bring the order up to the quantity
we actually need. Of course, you know what could happen if we
do this. They could ship the exact quantity of the order, and we
will have stockouts. We can’t win!

Rightsizing Inventory
Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)
Supplier relationship management can be deﬁned as establishing an
integrated partnership between the buyer and seller of products or ser-
vices, where both parties obtain mutual beneﬁts while satisfying market-
place needs. The SRM approach does not need to apply to all our suppliers
but certainly should be used with a select group of suppliers who have
the greatest impact on our supply-chain performance.
One of the key attributes of SRM is a greater sharing of information,
to the point where we should consider integrating some of our business
processes with them. Reduced costs and higher proﬁt margins are com-
monly shared business objectives between Woodstock and our suppliers.
SRM should be viewed as a strategic asset to Woodstock, and moving
forward, it should be developed as part of our strategic plan. Thus, SRM
is a long-term relationship with key suppliers to satisfy marketplace needs,
by improving product design and quality, eliminating non-value-added
costs, and focusing on those attributes that the customer is willing to pay for.
Strategic Sourcing
SRM is a philosophy of strategic sourcing with our key suppliers who
have the greatest impact on our supply chain. These can be suppliers
who we purchase the most materials from (dollars spent annually), provide
products or services that are key elements in our ﬁnal product, or con-
tribute to our proﬁtability and customer satisfaction. Suppliers who are
identiﬁed as partners in an SRM relationship should be considered an
internal upstream link in our supply chain; no different from all the other
internal links in our supply chain.
SRM Characteristics
1.
Silo mentality removed: Boundaries are removed and suppliers
are no longer a separate silo in the supply chain. Cross-functional
workgroups replace the traditional transaction-oriented relation-
ship. Business goals between buyer and seller are realigned and
business collaboration becomes a shared integrated effort.
2.
Improvement in product design: Product design engineers from
the buyer and seller work together to improve the product design
to reduce costs, improve productivity in manufacturing, increase
proﬁtability (for both), and satisfy customer (marketplace) needs.
3.
Involvement from product conception to production: Partners
work together in designing new products. They work concurrently

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

201
and are involved in all phases of new product development. This
includes product manufactured by both the buyer and seller.
4.
Technology sharing: As new technology becomes available it is
shared among partners for the beneﬁt of both.
5.
Development of new processes: Both parties can learn from
each other about how their products are currently manufactured
and provide input on how the processes can be improved.
6.
Sharing of business and strategic plans: Long-term strategies
related to new markets, new products, and new processes are
shared.
7.
Proﬁt sharing: Any cost savings due to the partnership are shared
between the partners. Equally important, any ﬁnancial loss due to
the relationship should also be shared.
8.
Open communication and information sharing: Complete and
open communications are established to the point where there is
sharing and integration of computer-based data and information.
9.
Customer-focused relationship: The focus is on satisfying the
customer needs.
10.
A win-win relationship: Both parties must receive beneﬁts from
the relationship. It cannot be skewed one way.
11.
Supply-chain eq. visibility: The relationship is not just between
purchasing and the supplier. In an ideal SRM environment, all links
in the internal supply chain, including the external customer,
interact with the supplier.
SRM and Inventory Management
What does SRM have to do with our inventory rightsizing efforts here at
Woodstock? The answer is a great deal. Because purchased parts represent
more than 50 percent of our COGS, it is one of our largest costs and
presents a signiﬁcant opportunity for improvement. The impact on inven-
tory and the beneﬁts are many. By working together we have the oppor-
tunity to:

Reduce purchased part lot sizes

Reduce purchased part lead times

Reduce the number of parts needed in our products

Standardize common parts in our products

Receive JIT deliveries from suppliers

Reduce cost of purchased parts

Increase productivity in our manufacturing

Increase capacity in our plant

202

Rightsizing Inventory
All these beneﬁts have common goals: increasing ﬂexibility and reduc-
ing inventory levels in our supply chain. Although I have cited these as
beneﬁts to us, they are also beneﬁts to our SRM partners when applied
to their suppliers. I know Eddie is pursuing an SRM relationship with
two of our key suppliers, and negotiations are taking place. Unfortunately,
we won’t feel the impact of this immediately; it will take several months
to implement.
TIP #72: Because purchased material typically represents
more than 50 percent of COGS, focusing on SRM with
key suppliers will signiﬁcantly improve inventory rightsiz-
ing efforts.
Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
One aspect of SRM I have deliberately kept separate is VMI. This operating
philosophy will help us signiﬁcantly in our inventory rightsizing effort. If
we can get just one key supplier to work with us in a VMI environment,
we will have dramatically improved our inventory rightsizing efforts.
One deﬁnition of VMI (there are several levels and deﬁnitions) is that
it is an inventory management optimization technique. With the visibility
of inventory levels and requirements of customers, suppliers maintain and
replenish their on-site inventory, following a pre-established replenishment
cycle. In some cases, the supplier retains ownership of the inventory until
it is transferred to the customer site, at which point the customer is invoiced
for the inventory.
With supply-chain visibility, the suppliers make and hold inventory in
their warehouse until needed by the customer. Similar to all other aspects
of SRM it must be a win-win situation for both the buyer and seller.
Although it may cost us a little more for the materials, in the long run
we will save money. The beneﬁts to Woodstock are:

Less in-house inventory

Reduction in carrying cost

Reduction in stockouts

Less internal inventory management required

Of the two SRM relationships, Eddie is pursuing a VMI program with
our battery distributor. As you know, we buy a high volume of batteries
in a variety of sizes, and we have problems controlling our inventory levels.
TIP #73: Implementation of a successful (and mutually
beneﬁcial) VMI program with key suppliers will beneﬁt
inventory rightsizing efforts.
I can’t stress enough how important the planning and purchasing links
are to our supply chain. Not just because that’s my job, but because we
are right in the middle of all the upstream and downstream supply links.
What we do or don’t do affects all the other links in our supply chain.
That’s all we have time for today. We still haven’t covered such areas
as supplier certiﬁcation criteria, and several other ordering methods such
as the two-bin system, order point, and the economic order quantity
(EOQ) technique. We will have to save that for another day. I understand
that your next meeting is with Michael, who is going to discuss product
and process design. You will learn a lot from him; I know we have.
The product and process design links will play a signiﬁcant role in
our inventory rightsizing efforts. Too often they are not included in any
discussions on inventory. When you consider that 60 percent to 70 percent
of a product’s cost is committed in the design phase, I’m very surprised
no one asks for their input.

We are getting there, slowly but surely. A lot of the
action items suggested by the various links in our sup-
ply chain are starting to show results. Finance has
started to report and track budgets for each link in our

Rightsizing Inventory
supply chain. It has also written off some old inventory
that we scrapped. The sales forecast has shown some
improvement and we have categorized our inventory
into A B C classiﬁcations.
We have begun to watch the A items more carefully
and the results are starting to show. We are now using
an S&OP and have established operating policies and
procedures on how to use it. Equally important, we now
have planning zones, should help keep schedule
changes down. These and the other suggestions we
implemented earlier are driving our inventory in the
right direction. Our thanks to everyone!
Today we met with the planning and purchasing links
and learned a lot more about how to rightsize our
inventory. I will summarize the highlights in this e-mail,
and as always, the details will be published in the meet-
ing minutes and sent to all supply-chain managers.
Meeting highlights and action items:
1.
It is the responsibility of planning and purchasing to
manage the six rights of inventory management. The
right: product, time, quantity, quality, cost, and supplier.
2.
It is the responsibility of planning to disaggregate the
S&OP, develop the MPS, and run the MRP process.
3.
Planning also compares capacity resources available
to capacity required (load) and resolves differences.
4.
Our planning process is very dynamic because of the
constant changes in schedule. Planning spends up to
70 percent of its time replanning. It explained all the
possible reasons for changes to the schedule.
5.
We have implemented a new planning policy and
divided our MPS into planning zones with levels of
authority needed to made changes in each zone.
This will help stabilize the MPS.
6.
We have also published a list of 20 possible schedule
changes and who to contact regarding the change.
Because some changes are time sensitive, we have
implemented a time policy for each change in each of
the three planning zones.
7.
We are establishing performance measurements for
each category of schedule change so that we can

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

205
identify the most signiﬁcant reasons for change and
try to get the root cause of those changes.
8.
We have found out that sometimes a customer will
cancel an order after we have already built the prod-
uct, and we get stuck with the inventory.
9.
We have asked sales and design engineering to
review our inventory for items that can be substituted
without having a negative impact on the ﬁnal product
form, ﬁt, or function. Sales will look into substituting
products at the ﬁnished goods level. The focus, as
always, is on meeting the customer’s expectations.
10.
We asked sales to review our order cancellation pol-
icy to ensure that we don’t get stuck with inventory
we made (customized) for a speciﬁc customer.
11.
Actual sales compared to forecast values will be pub-
lished every month to all supply-chain managers. This
will help us adjust our MPS accordingly.
12.
When we get an impact order (deﬁned in the min-
utes) it should be communicated to all links in the
supply chain.
13.
From now on, we will look at the total cost of MPS
schedule changes in zone 1 and will communicate the
amount to all links.
14.
We learned the difference between dependent and
independent demand. Every link in our supply chain
needs to understand the deﬁnitions of both. This will
be part of the re-education program we are developing.
15.
All product demand, beyond forecast and customer
orders, needs to be planned for. We are asking all links
to identify “other” product demands so that we can
put them in our MPS.
16.
There are strategies in our business plan that should
be communicated to all links in our supply chain. We
have asked Joe to communicate those strategies that
have an impact on the supply chain.
17.
The MPS can be used as a tool to maintain customer
service levels. We are looking at that along with the
sales link.
18.
We have asked manufacturing engineering to review
our current machine setup times. If we can reduce
machine setups, we can reduce lot sizes and make
less at one time.

206

Rightsizing Inventory
19.
We have also asked manufacturing engineering and
cost accounting to review all lot-size rules to ensure
that they are correct and meet the goals of our inven-
tory rightsizing efforts.
20.
MRP isn’t working well and it is a big contributor to
having the wrong inventory in stock. We need to
improve our inventory accuracy and BOM accuracy
to the 98 percent or 100 percent level. Design and
manufacturing engineering will review all BOMs for
accuracy, and manufacturing and distribution are
implementing a cycle-count program to improve
inventory accuracy (more on this later).
21.
We need to audit our lead times in the MRP system and
bring them up to date. We have established a review
policy to do this.
22.
MRP is a powerful inventory planning tool but is only
as good as the information feeding it (garbage in,
garbage out).
23.
Purchasing will work toward an SRM supplier part-
nership with key suppliers.
24.
Purchasing will work toward establishing a VMI pro-
gram with our battery distributor.
25.
Suppliers tend to overship us by 10 percent. This will
be addressed by purchasing.
26.
Purchasing will work with accounts payable to
improve our payment schedule to suppliers.
Attached to this e-mail is the latest version of our inven-
tory rightsizing model. Figure 5.12 shows the additions
added after our latest round of meetings and actions.
We ask that you provide the Harmony Team with feed-
back and suggestions on how we can further improve
our inventory rightsizing efforts.
We encourage you to ask questions and make com-
ments where appropriate. On May 8, we are meeting
with Michael from packaging engineering, who will
provide insight into the product design and product
design supply-chain links. Thank you for your time.

Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
In this chapter, we covered the planning and purchasing supply-chain
links. Nineteen new TIPS were provided for rightsizing your inventory,
and examples of how to use the most popular tools were given. Whereas
in Chapter 4, the emphasis was on the demand side of the supply and
demand equation, this chapter focuses on the supply side. A discussion
on how to apply the TIPS learned follows.
TIP #55: The S&OP is the primary tool used to develop
inventory plans for producing, purchasing, and stocking
speciﬁc end products, spare parts, and subassemblies.
Although S&OP is developed for product families and not speciﬁc end
products, the plan establishes guidelines on the aggregate inventory for
a product family. The total of the disaggregated plan (MPS) for a product
family must equal the aggregate quantity indicated in the S&OP. Looked
at in that light, it does become the primary tool to develop inventory
plans for speciﬁc end products. These are important points to be consid-
ered about this TIP:

Rightsizing Inventory
1.
Make sure all appropriate supply-chain links have input to the
S&OP, including suppliers and external customers.
2.
Don’t try to make the plan perfect. Although the plan should
consider all needs of the supply-chain links and conform to the
requirements of the business plan, it looks at the order of magnitude
of balancing supply and demand and should be treated as such.
3.
The planning horizon should go as far out into the future as needed
to acquire long-term resources such as new facilities and capital
equipment.
4.
Constantly monitor performance to plan and make adjustments
when necessary.
5.
The S&OP should be developed and approved by the highest-
ranking supply-chain executives in the company.
TIP #56: The MPS disaggregates the numbers in the S&OP,
and the sum of the items in the MPS must be equal to the
product family numbers in the S&OP.
The disaggregation of the S&OP into the MPS is a process usually
conducted by the planning department and should be considered as an
operating agreement by which all supply-chain links will operate. When
the plans are out of balance, either the demand or the supply must be
adjusted to bring them back in balance. These adjustments may ﬂow all
the way back to the inventory planning model and the business plan.
TIP #57: The ability to react to change in a rapid and
responsive manner will be a key to any inventory right-
sizing effort.
The velocity (speed) of making changes to the entire planning process
will be a key to your inventory rightsizing efforts. A very important point
to consider when using this TIP: If values change in one plan, adjustments
must be made to the other plans to bring them back in balance. For
example, if the MPS calls for building more product than the S&OP does,
then the latter should be adjusted accordingly. Likewise, the change may
necessitate revising the business plan by having to acquire additional
ﬁnancing to build more product than previously decided.
TIP #58: Develop, document, and communicate a proce-
dure to be followed when changes occur. Educate all
employees on the importance of communicating changes
to the proper links in the supply chain.

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

209
TIP #57 addressed the point that when changes are made all plans
should be adjusted to bring them back in balance. To ensure that this
happens, you should have a documented policy and procedure (in place
and communicated) for all supply-chain links to follow. For example, if
a signiﬁcant change is made to the S&OP, but not communicated to the
planning department in a timely manner, inventory build plans can quickly
become out of balance.
TIP #59: Changes to the MPS in zone 1 can increase costs
and inventory levels. Changes in zone 1 should be kept
to a minimum and analyzed for the total impact to the
supply chain.
Because the MPS is a commitment to build as well as buy inventory,
it is an important plan that will impact all supply-chain links. It cannot
be treated as a silo activity. Your company should have an established
policy on who can make changes in each zone of the MPS. Here is a
general guideline to follow:

Zone 1 changes: Only an executive-level manager should autho-
rize changes. In a small company, this could be the company
president. In large companies, it should be at the vice president
level. The purpose is to raise the visibility of change in zone 1
because these will be the most costly to make. A new order inserted
into the MPS may seem proﬁtable, but because of the change, the
order may in fact be unproﬁtable.

Zone 2 changes: In theory, changes in zone 2 will be less costly
to make and can be authorized by a director or manager-level
person. This doesn’t mean that changes in this zone are less
important or that the personnel are less capable; it merely means
that the decision making can be delegated to a different authority.

Zone 3 changes: Conceptually, zone 3 is far out, so that changes
in this zone will have the least impact on the supply chain. If you
are using an MRP system, you can allow the computer to make
changes as needed. This zone will represent planned orders, and
the planners can use their judgment about whether they should
react to MRP recommendations. Changes in this zone are typically
made by planners and buyers.
TIP #60: Every time an unplanned order (impact order) is
expedited into the schedule, another order (or more)
should be de-expedited.

210

Rightsizing Inventory
This is an often-overlooked process. How many times has sales asked
production to expedite an order and not tell production which order to
reschedule out? Given an option, sales would like to satisfy all orders and
not reschedule any of them out. An impact order will be deﬁned differently
for each company. As a general rule, an impact order is an order that
may cause the following conditions:
1.
Change to a machine setup
2.
Premium charges for raw material
3.
A premium for freight transportation (raw material in and ﬁnished
goods out)
4.
Need to work overtime
5.
A bullwhip effect upstream and downstream in the supply chain
6.
Postponement of scheduled orders
7.
Impact on morale
Have a written policy in place stating that every time an order is
expedited into the system, someone (deﬁned differently for each company)
must agree on which orders will be de-expedited. For this TIP to work
effectively, the orders that are de-expedited must be rescheduled in your
planning system.
TIP #61: The contents of the business plan related to
inventory management activities should be communicated
to all supply-chain employees who have an impact on
achieving those goals and objectives.
Far too many companies treat the business plan as a secret document,
and its contents are communicated on a “need to know” basis. This is
wrong. I realize that some information is sensitive and shouldn’t be
communicated to everyone. However, there is some information that is
important for operating personnel to know, and therefore, it should be
communicated. What’s the point of putting a statement in the business
plan that calls for a 25 percent reduction in inventory if you don’t tell
anyone? The following business plan information that may impact your
inventory rightsizing efforts:
1.
Reductions in inventory
2.
Increases in inventory
3.
New product introductions
4.
Changes in customer service levels
5.
Product life-cycle changes (market exit strategy)
6.
Capital equipment expenditures and freezes

Changes in supply-chain conﬁguration
TIP #62: Balancing workload (MPS) with available capac-
ity is an important step in rightsizing inventory levels in
the supply chain.
In this chapter, we discussed developing the MPS and then performing
RCCP to validate the MPS. RCCP is a concept of analyzing your critical
work centers to see if the workload (orders) is in balance with your
capacity (resources). Typically, a company will look at a bottleneck work
center. A bottleneck work center is one in which the demand for the
resource is greater than the capability of the resource. You should try to
improve the output of your bottleneck work center. If you can’t, then all
upstream and downstream work centers should be aligned with the
capacity of the bottleneck, so that WIP ﬂows at a constant rate.
TIP #63: Reducing machine setup time will allow for pro-
ducing smaller batches of inventory more frequently and
will help reduce the amount of inventory carried in stock.
Reducing machine setup time will greatly improve your ﬂexibility to
respond to change. Reducing setup times to minutes rather than hours
will allow you to make smaller batches of inventory in a cost-effective
way. Machine setup time is the time required to get a machine ready for
a different part than the part previously completed. Setup time will be
covered in more detail in later chapters, but for now it is important to
note that reducing machine setup time will in theory increase your
capacity. The following are important points to be considered when using
this TIP:
1.
Identify your bottleneck operation and improve it.
2.
Look to reduce your longest setup times ﬁrst.
3.
Keep the machine running as long as possible during the machine
setup (do as much external setup as possible).
4.
Educate operators and machine setup personnel on the latest
machine setup methodologies.
5.
Benchmark your current machine setup time.
6.
Establish goals for improving the benchmark.
7.
Measure performance as compared to the goal.
8.
Continually look for ways to improve setup times.

212

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #64: Constantly review and update your lot-size rules
with a hypothetical goal of reducing all lot sizes to one.
Poorly deﬁned or outdated lot-size rules will have an impact on your
inventory rightsizing efforts. It will require that you constantly monitor
and update lot-size rules on a continuous basis; this is especially true of
purchased parts. In all probability, you have a better handle on internal
manufacturing lot-size rules — or maybe not. For both purchased and
manufactured parts, the following should be considered:
1.
Establish a policy on when lot-size rules will be reviewed and
updated.
2.
Identify which links will make changes to the rules.
3.
All information systems (manual or computer based) should be
updated and in sync.
4.
Communicate lot-size policies to all suppliers (for purchased parts).
TIP #65: The MPS must be realistic and achievable. If not,
inventory will increase and customer service will decrease
over time.
I have an old saying: “Lie to your planning system and it will lie right
back to you — only faster.” The computer is a wonderful and useful tool,
but it is only as good as the data it is given to work with. There is another
old truism: “garbage in, garbage out.” If the MPS isn’t achievable, what good
is it? One of the reasons many companies have an unrealistic and non-
achievable MPS is that they never reschedule the order backlog in their
system. We spoke earlier about expediting and de-expediting. When you
expedite you should reschedule the orders that you couldn’t ﬁnish, for one
reason or another. If you have a full load of work scheduled in week 1 of
your MPS, and you also have a backlog from the week before, you are
misstating your MPS and you will not achieve the plan for that week, and
probably for many weeks thereafter if you don’t reschedule the backlog.
TIP #66: Executing the recommendations of MRP will have
a signiﬁcant impact on inventory rightsizing efforts.
We spoke earlier about the fact that MRP doesn’t automatically change
orders. It makes recommendations, and it depends on human judgment
whether you act on the recommendations. Not acting can be just as
detrimental as taking action. If your system is making too many recom-
mendations, or the next time you run MRP it is changing the recommen-

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

213
dations back to what they originally were, it may be a symptom of a
“nervous system.”
If you are making changes to the MPS every day, or many times a
day, you will have a slew of recommendations. You should be careful
with this. If you ﬁnd that you are making multiple changes to the same
part and maybe returning to the previous recommendations, you will
create a very unstable planning environment. This point goes back to
freezing the MPS and zone 1. Every effort should be made to freeze the
schedule in zone 1, and then you can better validate the MRP recommen-
dations for that zone.
TIP #67: Inventory accuracy must be in the 98 percent to
100 percent range for MRP to function successfully. It will
be almost impossible to rightsize inventory without this
level of inventory accuracy.
As explained earlier, different links will have different deﬁnitions of
inventory accuracy and how it’s calculated. The one fact in common with
any deﬁnition is that inaccurate inventory causes many problems. If your
perpetual system says you have more than you physically have, then you
will experience stockouts and have unhappy customers and employees.
If your perpetual system says you have less than you actually have, then
it is hiding a lot of problems you won’t see. What you will have in the
latter example is an irate ﬁnance silo. They will notice.
TIP #68: Have design engineering review the current
inventory and provide a list of parts that can be used to
substitute for the primary part, as long as it can meet the
criteria of form, ﬁt, and function.
There is a high probability that you have something sitting in inventory
that you don’t need for the product it was made/purchased for, but can
be used as a substitute for a needed product. You can make this happen
as follows:
1.
Establish a material review committee consisting of design engi-
neering, manufacturing, quality, planning, and purchasing.
2.
The committee should meet at least once a month to review inactive
inventory or items with a higher-than-needed inventory level.
3.
Provide the inventory list to the committee members at least one
week prior to the meeting so that everyone can come prepared
to take action at the meeting.

214

Rightsizing Inventory
4.
If a crisis shortage comes up before the scheduled meeting, have
planning review possible substitutes with design engineering on
an ad hoc basis.
TIP #69: Inaccurate purchasing and manufacturing lead
times have a signiﬁcant impact on inventory levels and
require constant review and updating. An operating policy
must be in place to ensure that lead times are current and
up to date.
Many companies focus a lot of attention on getting their inventory and
BOM records as accurate as possible. That is a true and noble task, but
accurate manufacturing and purchasing lead times are just as important
to your inventory rightsizing efforts. If lead times are actually longer than
the system says, then the material will be late and you will have a stockout
(unless you are carrying safety stock). If lead times are really shorter than
the system says, you will probably experience an increase in inventory
by making the product early or having purchased material arriving earlier
than expected. To keep this from occurring you should:
1.
Periodically review all lead times
2.
Assign lead time review responsibility
3.
Document date of change in the system
4.
Make sure lead times are in sync between multiple systems
(databases)
TIP #70: Lot-size rules have a signiﬁcant impact on inven-
tory levels and should be reviewed and updated con-
stantly. An operating policy must be in place to ensure
this happens.
Similar to lead times, lot-size rules will have a signiﬁcant impact on
your inventory rightsizing efforts. Remember, you control and determine
your internal supply-chain lot sizes. It is with purchased parts that many
companies have difﬁculty controlling purchase quantities. This is particu-
larly true if you are a small, infrequent buyer to the supplier. You may
be able to reduce lot sizes by the following methods:
1.
Simply explain your situation to the supplier. If you don’t ask,
you’ll never know. What’s the worst they can do? Say no.
2.
Determine what your annual buy for the year is for that part and
place a blanket order with multiple delivery dates throughout the year.

How Much Inventory Should We Make or Buy?

215
3.
Conduct a cost analysis to determine if paying a premium for a
smaller lot size will be offset by the cost of carrying the inventory
in stock.
4.
On internal supply-chain lot sizes, challenge the current lot-size
rules to see if they make sense. Sometimes, it’s just a communi-
cation problem.
TIP #71: The four areas of data integrity don’t just apply
to MRP; these four areas are important to all links in the
supply chain.
I call these four areas of data integrity the supply chain “BILL of
Integrity” (BOI). BILL stands for:
Bill of material accuracy (B)
Inventory accuracy (I)
Lead time accuracy (L)
Lot-size rule accuracy (L)
An accurate BILL is critical to your inventory rightsizing efforts. Many
companies will address these four areas when they embark on an MRP
implementation. The consultants and software suppliers will advise them
that MRP will not work effectively without a BOI, and rightly so. However,
it usually stops there. Two points that will help you improve your BOI:
1.
Don’t just focus on the parts using MRP. Apply BOI to all parts
and materials.
2.
The BOI must be sustained on a continuing basis and not treated
as a project with start and end dates.
TIP #72: Because purchased material typically represents
more than 50 percent of COGS, focusing on SRM with
key suppliers will signiﬁcantly improve inventory rightsiz-
ing efforts.
Considering the fact that one of the largest costs of most supply chains
is the cost of material, it is an area that you should focus a lot of attention
on. In today’s competitive environment, the supply chain that can reduce
these costs will have an advantage over its competition. Purchasing must
move from being a reactive silo to a proactive cross-functional collaborator
with other links in the supply chain. If you are spending 95 percent of
the time expediting and only 5 percent of the time on true purchasing
activities, you must reverse these percentages to be effective. You can

216

Rightsizing Inventory
start by focusing on key suppliers and establishing a true partnership with
them.
TIP #73: Implementation of a successful (and mutually
beneﬁcial) VMI program with key suppliers will beneﬁt
inventory rightsizing efforts.
VMI isn’t a concept that can be used by all supply chains, and a VMI
program will only work well if there are beneﬁts to both the buyer and
seller. For a VMI program to work effectively, consider the following:
1.
Forecast for demand should be predictable and accurate.
2.
VMI will work best with stable demand items.
3.
Item quantity is signiﬁcant.
4.
The total cost of the VMI item should be considered.
5.
The relationship is proﬁtable to both parties.
This chapter on planning and purchasing is at the very heart of the
supply chain, and successful execution of the topics covered will help
you rightsize your inventory. Similar to all other links in the supply
chain, they must move from a silo focus and become part of your
collaborative supply-chain network. Table 5.1 shows the most current
status of the Woodstock inventory, and Table 5.2 shows the excess
inventory by ABC classiﬁcation.

How Can We Improve the 
Product and Process 
Design to Minimize 
Inventory Levels?
May 8, Harmony Team Meeting
Woodstock Inventory: $39 Million
My name is Michael, and I am a packaging engineer for Woodstock
Lighting Group.
I really hope this inventory rightsizing effort works. I like working here and
have made a lot of new friends. I told Butchie just the other night that as
screwed up as the company is, I could spend the rest of my career here.
I’m not one to change jobs every six months. The company was generous
enough to sponsor my hockey team this season, and for that I am grateful.
For the ﬁrst time since I’ve been here, I really think we have an opportunity
to get our act together, and we are becoming a team. I just wish people
would stop complaining and talking about each other. I think we need to
get rid of the politics constantly going on and start to trust each other more.
If I say this openly everyone will deny it, but it’s true. If everyone would
expend the same energy on ﬁxing the inventory problems as they expend
ﬁguring out how to get out of doing their job, we could be awesome.

Rightsizing Inventory
Maybe my positive attitude will rub off on the Harmony Team and we
can work together. I will do my utmost and hope for the best, but if I feel
it’s going to be business as usual, I’m getting out of here. Joe is the key to
our inventory rightsizing efforts. He must set a good example by demon-
strating a positive attitude and he must stop antagonizing everyone. Just
because he chooses to work 12 to 14 hours a day, he shouldn’t expect
everyone to. I never understood that work ethic. Oh well, I guess I should
focus on matters I can help change, and not worry about those I can’t.
How can we improve the product and process design to mini-
mize inventory levels? It’s a good question and as I speak, we are
aggressively pursuing the answer to that very question. Before I start, I
want to note that our inventory went down, but not much. This shouldn’t
be a surprise to anyone. Once Cyndie, Eddie, and their teams reviewed
and updated all the system lead times and lot-size rules, it was predictable.
Materials requirement planning (MRP) is now generating realistic informa-
tion. It is ﬁnding that on some items we have too much inventory and
on others we don’t have enough. So it has to bring the inventory into
balance. In time, this will correct itself and the inventory will start to go
down as the adjustments take effect. If they hadn’t corrected the planning
data, we would have continued to bring in the wrong inventory and our
inventory rightsizing efforts would not be successful.
TIP #74: Any drastic changes in your MRP data may cause
inventory levels to rise, until inventory is rebalanced and
adjusted to the new planning requirements. Over time, it
will begin to correct itself and decrease accordingly.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)
Product Design and Inventory
If I had to guess, I would say that 50 percent to 70 percent of our product’s
total costs are determined in the product design phase. This is where we
determine what parts and how many of them will be in our products.
Product design will impact the type of packaging we use and could even
affect our warehousing, transportation, ﬁeld service, and warranty costs
— and they are signiﬁcant. On top of all that, product design will
determine our selling costs and proﬁtability. Do I have your attention? I
hope so.
In times gone by, product design engineers could design a new product
in their own little silo and then throw it over the wall for the rest of the
links in our supply chain to ﬁgure out how to build it, price it, store it,

Product and Process Design to Minimize

221
and ship it. Not only was this poor communication among the links, but
it was extremely costly and time consuming. In an age in which products
have shorter and shorter life spans, Woodstock is put in the precarious
position of being late to market with new products, and our ability to
capture market share is compromised. Although a product should be
designed to satisfy the customer’s expectations, it is equally important that
the product is designed to be manufactured efﬁciently, quickly, and at a
reasonable cost. A poor design can impede productivity and increase
manufacturing cost.
This focus on designing products to be produced efﬁciently and cost
effectively is often called “design for manufacturability (DFM)” and “design
for assembly (DFA).” Sometimes, the terms are combined and referred to
as “design for manufacturability and assembly (DFMA).”
TIP #75: Product design has a major impact on inventory
costs through every link in the supply chain. The design
must become a cross-functional process with inputs from
all links in the supply chain, including suppliers and
customers.
Product Design: Role and Responsibilities
I am going to take a different tack than my peers in the other links by
speaking about product design’s role working concurrently with other
speciﬁc links in our supply chain:

External customers: What better input can we get than feedback
from our customers who buy our products and their customers
who use them? We ask these customers what new generation of
products they would like us to produce and what enhancements
they would like to see in our current product offerings. We do
this in a formal structure. Twice a year we have meetings with
different customer groups to show them some of the new products
we are currently working on and the planned enhancements to
existing products.
Along with sales and marketing, we have hosted this two-day
event at three different locations across the United States. This is
a great forum to get new ideas and suggestions. After these joint
meetings, we visit some of the customers who attended, to view
their operation. In many cases it is a distributor (ﬂashlights), who
sells our product to retailers. We analyze how they stock, pick,
and ship our products to their customers.

222

Rightsizing Inventory
In some cases, it is a subcontractor who is modifying a vehicle so
that our light assemblies can be attached. We have even visited
with the U.S. military to see how our ﬂashlights and spotlights are
used in the ﬁeld. We ask our customers to share their insights into
what new products they have on their drawing board. We even
ask certain customers to participate in our product design teams.

Suppliers: We can learn a great deal from our suppliers. Eddie or
Cyndie has probably already told you we have scheduled “supplier
days,” when we invite some of our key suppliers (Eddie calls them
partners) to visit our plant and take a tour of our manufacturing
environment so they can see how we use their product. We hope
to get ideas from them that will allow us to improve our product
and reduce our costs. We in turn will visit their facility to see how
they manufacture the products we buy from them. We may be
able to improve both our products for our mutual beneﬁt.

Warehouse and distribution: We have been working with our
peers in these two links to see how the product can be better
designed for storage, packing, and shipping. In fact, we just had a
meeting with them last week and have come up with a new-size
carton that will allow us to store more cartons on a skid (pallets),
without negatively impacting weight limitations and safety require-
ments. We are going to pass this new carton idea by our largest
distributors to see if it will be useful for their internal operation.

Sales and marketing: These are two more critical links in our
supply chain. Sales can share with us what the customers are saying
about our products, what’s good about them, and how they can
be improved. Marketing is always on the lookout for new product
ideas and is out in the ﬁeld visiting customers, taking surveys, and
attending industry trade shows to ﬁnd out what the latest and
greatest is. We get a lot of good input from these two links.

Field service: The people on our ﬁeld service team are at customer
sites all the time. In fact, they spend more time with the customers
than our sales team and other internal links do. They know what
problems there are in the ﬁeld (with our products) and are a good
source for value-added product enhancements. We consider the
needs of all our customers, not just the large ones.

Manufacturing: Because this link produces what we design,
input is absolutely critical. What good is it for us to design the
“best product in the world,” if it can’t be manufactured cost
effectively?

Purchasing and planning: Sometimes we design a new product
and don’t know if the parts we are using are standard off-the-
shelf parts or custom made. The rule of thumb is we want to use

Product and Process Design to Minimize

223
standard parts where possible (if it’s cost effective). Purchasing
personnel will know the answer to this question, and we are
constantly working with them on this issue. Planning, on the other
hand, needs to be involved because of lead time and lot-size
issues. There are two principles at work here for planning. First,
the greater the total number of parts designed into the product,
the more parts planning has to watch and schedule. Second, the
greater the variety of parts, the more parts planning has to watch
and schedule. Put in another way, the fewer the parts, the less
the scheduling; the more the standardization of parts, the less the
complexity in scheduling.

Information technology: Although not directly involved in the
design of new products, IT has been very helpful in identifying
new tools and technologies that have made our job easier over
the years. I hate to think of what it was like before we had
computer-aided-design (CAD) systems. Since we upgraded our
CAD system last year, we have increased our product design
productivity by 25 percent. IT is constantly on the lookout for new
technology to make our link more efﬁcient.

Finance and accounting: You may be asking yourself, what does
accounting and ﬁnance have to do with new product design? My
answer is — a lot. After the product is designed (oops, I’m wrong;
I meant to say, “as the product is being designed”), it has to
evaluate all costs associated with the new product. It may ﬁnd
that the total cost to bring the new product to market is so high
that we will lose money. Believe me when I say it; this has
happened.

Quality control and assurance: Although we have consistently
treated quality as part of the manufacturing link, I wanted to
break it out in this part of our conversation because of the
contribution it can make, particularly with product enhancements.
One of its responsibilities here at Woodstock is to analyze
returned goods. It has ﬁrsthand knowledge about quality defects
in our products and helps us improve our current product line.
This gives us some insight into what can potentially go wrong
with a new product.

Competitors: Don’t be so surprised. Yes, in a way, we interact
with competitors. We buy our competitor’s products and reverse
engineer them. Reverse engineering is where we disassemble and
evaluate our competitor’s products. Our objective is to identify the
characteristics of their product so that we can improve our products
and manufacturing processes without infringing on our competi-
tor’s proprietary technologies.

224

Rightsizing Inventory
Working as a Team to Bring Product to Market
The bottom line is we interact with the entire supply chain from the very
beginning of new product design. This “working together” has many
names. Two of the more popular names are simultaneous engineering
and concurrent engineering. Call it what you will, a product must be
designed with consideration of the needs of the entire supply chain. Figure
6.1 illustrates this cross-functional approach to product design and
enhancement. Not all inputs are shown in this example. This is just an
example representing all 19 links in our supply chain. The two major
outputs of process design are products and manufacturing processes.
Generally speaking, our responsibility is to design new products and
to enhance existing ones. But what does all this have to do with rightsizing
our inventory? The answer is — plenty. By working as a team we can
impact inventory in several important ways. The inventory objectives
would be:
1.
Reducing the total number of parts in our products
2.
Replacing unique parts with off-the-shelf parts
3.
Combining parts so that there is less need for different part numbers
4.
Designing parts for ease of handling and inventory storage
5.
Reducing the need for rework and scrap

If we accomplish these objectives, we would have fewer part numbers
and less inventory, and as a result could reduce the planning effort. I
always thought companies that manufacture baseball caps were a good
example of applying the principle of standardization. Years ago, they had
to stock inventory on all different sizes of hats. I don’t know how many
sizes there were, but today we live in a one-size-ﬁts-all world. They
manufacture one size and use a Velcro-backed tab that can be adjusted
to the precise size needed. This “mass customization” has greatly reduced
the number of items they have to make, stock, and ship. What a wonderful,
cost-saving idea.
TIP #76: Designing products collaboratively with other
links in the supply chain can beneﬁt your inventory right-
sizing effort by eliminating or reducing the total number
and variety of parts that have to be planned for and
stocked in inventory.
New Product Development Example
Let me share with you an example of a concurrent engineering project
we are very close to ﬁnalizing. We have worked with many links in our
supply chain to develop this new product, including two key suppliers
and three of our customers.
The new product is a compact lantern that will be sold through our
Flashlight Division. This compact lantern is styled along the lines of the
old kerosene lanterns that have been around for years. Our lantern will
operate with batteries rather than kerosene. It is lightweight, water resistant
and comes with a canvas carrying case, rechargeable battery pack and a
battery recharger. This product is unique because it is so compact and
lightweight that it is easy and convenient to travel with on camping trips,
picnics, beach parties, and hiking trips. It can also be readily stored in
the home or ofﬁce for emergency lighting use. Another unique feature of
our product that distinguishes it from our competition is that it will have
a remote control that will allow the user to turn it on and off at a distance.
This will also help locate the lantern in the dark. Although the remote
control is an important feature of the product, it won’t be available for
the ﬁrst release. As you can see from Table 6.1, the initial design developed
by our product design engineers had a total number of 56 parts, assigned
30 different part numbers.
That’s a lot of inventory to buy, make, store, assemble, plan, and keep
track of. Besides, it drives up the cost of the ﬁnished product. Now, I

226

don’t want to get into a lot of details, but the goal of our concurrent
engineering team was to:
1.
Reduce the total number of parts
2.
Use common off-the-shelf parts where possible
3.
Standardize on fewer part numbers
4.
Outsource some subassemblies

For example, the hanging hook and the hook holder that attaches to
the lantern were originally designed as three separate pieces. We rede-
signed it using one mold, and now it is one piece rather than three. The
original design called for six screws of three different sizes (two of each
size). Working with our supplier and our own manufacturing people, we
were able to reduce the total number of screws to three, all of the same
size, and they are a standard size we can buy, if need be, at a local
hardware store.
The original design of the light reﬂectors had four different parts of
different shapes and sizes. Working with purchasing and our supplier, we
were able to reduce the total down to two light reﬂectors of different
sizes. We are working on getting it standardized to one size reﬂector.
Our customers were very helpful in giving us input to the design of
the canvas carrying case. They came up with the idea of waterprooﬁng
the carrying case and adding a pouch to carry the battery recharger and
an extra battery pack, thus making the new product more user friendly.
These are just some of the examples of how the concurrent engineering
effort helped us design a more cost-effective, user-friendly product.
Because of this concurrent engineering effort, we were able to
reduce the total number of parts to 45 and different part numbers to
20. This resulted in an estimated material cost reduction of $1.50 per
lantern. The labor cost to assemble the lantern was reduced by $0.50
per lantern. Based on the initial marketing forecast of 50,000 units for
the ﬁrst year, the total estimated material and labor saving would be
$100,000 for the year.
This will accomplish two things: First, it will increase our proﬁt margin,
and secondly, if we reduce the selling price, we may sell more units. The
cost saving that is difﬁcult to measure is the amount of time that will be
saved by planning and purchasing by not having to plan for and buy the
11 extra parts. There will be a savings in carrying cost because we will
be carrying less overall inventory on this new product. I don’t know what
the saving will be, but it will certainly be a positive number. Imagine if
we could do this with every product we make? The cost savings would
be phenomenal.
This concurrent engineering effort will be continued for all new prod-
ucts. We are going back to the drawing board to review our current
products to see if we can apply the same design concepts. One important
point I failed to mention is that the supplier who came up with the idea
of molding one plastic part for the hook instead of three will make a
greater proﬁt margin per hook, and eventually we will be paying less.
This is an example of both parties beneﬁting from the partnership in the
design phase. It is a win-win situation for both of us.

228

Rightsizing Inventory
I believe the more we can get our suppliers to design our parts based
on a collaborative effort, the better off we will be. Of course, this doesn’t
apply to all suppliers. To some suppliers, we aren’t a big enough player
for them to get involved with our design team. You can’t have true
collaborative product design without involving other links in the supply
chain. In summary, a concurrent engineering approach should consider:
1.
Minimizing the number of parts in a product
2.
Minimizing the variety of parts in a product
3.
Including all links in the supply chain that are impacted by the
product design
4.
Using existing resources: machines, equipment, skill sets, and
processes
5.
Designing for mass customization
6.
Designing for product modularity
7.
Using materials that will ease the production process
8.
Using off-the-shelf parts rather than custom-made parts
9.
Simplifying the packaging process
10.
Simplifying the storage and retrieval process
11.
Designing products for ease of repair and parts replacement
12.
Designing products that are environmentally safe
13.
Designing products that are environmentally disposable at the end
of life
14.
Designing products that consume less energy
15.
Using lightweight materials that are ergonomically user friendly
where possible to reduce transportation costs
One characteristic that I would like to talk about separately is designing
products for “inventory postponement.” This strategy calls for shifting
product differentiation as far downstream in the supply chain as possible.
This will be particularly appropriate for the new line of light bars we are
making for emergency vehicles. We are replacing conventional light bulbs
with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which last longer because they have
no ﬁlaments to burn out. These light bars come in many color combina-
tions (options). We plan to manufacture subassemblies to stock and not
commit to the ﬁnal assembly until after receipt of the customer order.
This will prevent us from stocking the wrong ﬁnished products, which
would have a negative impact on our inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #77: Use an inventory postponement strategy that
shifts product differentiation as far downstream as possi-
ble, so that ﬁnal inventory conﬁguration is committed
when customer requirements are known.

Product and Process Design to Minimize

229
In the long run, concurrent engineering will bring us great beneﬁts in
our inventory rightsizing effort, but the impact on our short-term efforts
will be minimal. There is one important task that design engineering can
take on that will greatly enhance our short-term inventory rightsizing
efforts: substituting parts that we have in inventory rather than buying
new parts. I bet Cyndie covered this when she spoke about stockouts.
Substituting Part Numbers
We have just hired two interns who are “soon to be engineers,” who will
be seniors next year. They start in about two weeks. Their job over the
summer is to analyze our existing inventory and look for opportunities
to substitute the existing inventory in production, rather than buying new
material. I know you are already aware of this effort, but I wanted to
point out that I believe there is a signiﬁcant opportunity to consume a
lot of the inactive inventory.
It will be a tedious process. They will start out by looking at the
inactive raw material inventory items with a value of $10,000 or greater.
They will run a “where-used” report to see where the part was originally
used and compare it to other product drawings. If they ﬁnd something,
they will check with planning (on active parts) to be sure it isn’t committed
to production at a later date in another product. I’d be surprised if Planning
will need it because these items have been inactive for a year or longer.
This is a lot of grunt work. I don’t envy them, but they will get it
done. When you publish the minutes of the meeting today, please be
sure to mention to all the other links that this effort will be taking place
this summer. I will benchmark our current inactive inventory level when
they start and report back to the team the results of this effort at the end
of August.
TIP #78: Look to substitute existing inventory into a prod-
uct, rather than going out to buy a similar part, if the
substituted part can perform the same form, ﬁt, and func-
tion to meet and satisfy customer expectations.
Inventory Part Numbering System
As inventory variety increases, the number of part numbers used to identify
inventory items increases. Although this may seem to be a minor issue,
it can hinder our inventory rightsizing efforts as we increase the variety
in our product lines. We have many parts that look the same to the naked
eye but are unique in some way.

230

Rightsizing Inventory
The general rule is that different parts should have their own unique
item number and that a part number should be used only once. This can
sometimes be a challenge for us. Our item identiﬁcation codes are 12
alpha/numeric characters long (this currently includes three zeros to allow
for expansion). Marketing says it wants to have a maximum item identi-
ﬁcation code of ﬁve alpha/numeric characters in the new product catalog
it is working on for the Flashlight Division. This will make ordering easier
for our customers. In some ways I agree. I have looked at four different
catalogs published by major catalog retailers and the item codes range
from ﬁve to ten alpha/numeric characters. To complicate matters, one of
our major customers wants us to use its product number on our identiﬁ-
cation tags.
We have reached a compromise of sorts and will continue to use our
12-digit identiﬁcation number for all internal operations. In the catalog,
we will use the ﬁrst digit and last four digits of the product item number.
For example, our standard 7.25-inch ﬂashlight is identiﬁed as item
#A000632-5729. In the new catalog, this will be item #A5729. Our computer
system will recognize the ﬁve-digit code and convert it to our twelve-digit
item number for all internal use. In regard to our customers’ request that
we use their number, we will do so, but the tag will also include our
internal number. So it appears that issue has been resolved (for now).
There are certain principles and conventions that should be followed
with item identiﬁcation. Let me summarize some of the more important
ones for you:
1.
Item codes should be unique, and each code should be used to
identify only one item.
2.
Item codes should be assigned and controlled by only one link in
the supply chain. In our case it is product design.
3.
Item codes should be as short as possible. Because item codes
may have to be keyed into a record or written down, there is a
high probability of error. The longer the item number, the higher
the probability of error in translation.
4.
Part numbers for discontinued products should no longer be used
elsewhere. Customers may still have a product out years after we
discontinue the item. This relates to beacon lights in particular.
5.
Item codes should be uniform in size. All our parts have a 12-digit
code, even though there are a lot of zeros.
6.
The use of the 12-digit code allows for growth and expansion.
7.
Avoid alpha/number combinations that may cause communication
errors — for example, using the number 0 and the letter o side
by side.

Product and Process Design to Minimize

231
8.
Create, maintain, and publish a list of active item numbers peri-
odically, at least once a year.
TIP #79: A formal, structured part numbering system should
be used. Item codes should be kept as short and simple as
possible to eliminate the potential for translation errors,
which may impede your inventory rightsizing efforts.
Meaningful Versus Nonmeaningful Part Numbers
By deﬁnition, meaningful part numbers communicate some information
about the part/product that helps with product identiﬁcation. Nonmean-
ingful part numbers do not communicate any information about the
part/product. Which is more appropriate? The answer is — it depends.
There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods.
Meaningful part numbers are easier to understand and remember. This
is particularly true when products come in multiple sizes and colors. On
the other hand, you have to be careful you don’t run out of numbers for
a particular product line.
Nonmeaningful numbers will allow for growth and expansion and for
the use of check digits to avoid data entry errors. The downside is they
may be more difﬁcult to use and remember. Woodstock decided years
ago to use nonmeaningful part numbers because we wanted to allow for
expansion and growth.
OK, now that I’ve explained (hopefully) the role product design can
play in rightsizing inventory, I would like to move on to another important
topic: the role of process design in our inventory rightsizing efforts.
Process Design and Inventory
Process design focuses on the processes used to make and move inventory
throughout our entire supply chain. This encompasses how our work areas
on the factory ﬂoor are laid out and the paths our products take through
the plant and distribution center. The goal is to construct a process that is
efﬁcient and cost effective. To improve an existing process, we must ﬁrst
understand the details of how the current process functions today. The
characteristics of an efﬁcient plant layout and their effect on inventory are:

Process ﬂexibility: The ability to respond to ever-changing pro-
duction requirements. Make only the inventory needed to satisfy
current customer requirements.

232

Rightsizing Inventory

Minimal production interruption: Have a continuous ﬂow of
product through the plant without interrupting the transformation
process. Minimize work-in-process (WIP) and reduce the amount
of inventory sitting in queue.

Lead time reduction: Reducing the total lead time will reduce
the total cycle time and result in less WIP inventory.

Minimal material handling: Reconﬁguring the physical work
center so that inventory movement and handling is minimized.

Reduction of WIP inventory: Developing a transformation pro-
cess that minimizes the amount of WIP inventory.

Improved process visibility: Removing unnecessary inventory
from the work center that isn’t needed to improve visibility, so
that inventory bottlenecks can be more readily identiﬁed and ﬁxed.

Reduction in product rework: Having operators inspect their
own work so that damaged/poor quality inventory isn’t passed on
to a downstream work center.

Improved product quality: Using signals to stop producing poor
quality inventory so as to keep it to a minimum.

Elimination of production bottlenecks: Rapid identiﬁcation and
resolution of inventory bottlenecks in the transformation process.

Use of cellular production layouts: Improving physical plant
layouts so that inventory throughput is improved.

Work cells organized to produce product families: Reconﬁg-
uring plant layout so that instead of organizing machines and
processes by similarity of the type of machine, they are organized
into work cells conﬁgured based on similarity of the total manu-
facturing process of inventory product families.

Reduction in machine setup times: Reducing the machine setup
time to produce a different part, so that inventory lot sizes can be
reduced and variety can be increased.

Utilizing poka-yoke techniques: Mistake-prooﬁng the manufac-

As you can see, the processes we design and use to manufacture our
products have a signiﬁcant impact on inventory.
Examples of Process Flow
If you think of your everyday lives, you are constantly involved in a
process ﬂow and probably don’t even think about it. As you go about
your personal chores, you become part of an inventory process ﬂow.
Here are some examples:

Banking: When you go inside the bank, everyone gets in one line.
You eventually get to the head of the line for the “next available
teller.” This helps avoid large queues so that you, the customer,
don’t get stuck behind someone with multiple transactions.

Supermarkets: This is one of my favorites. You have lots of options:
1. Ten items or less
2. Fifteen items or less
3. Cash only
4. Bagger or no bagger
5. Cash, check, or credit card
6. Full service
7. Self-checkout
I don’t know the details on the volumes of the full-service versus
the ten-items-or-less line, but my guess would be that the latter
processes more customers in one day and the former, more dollar
value. What I ﬁnd most interesting is that I am starting to like the
self-checkout. Who would have thought that I would actually enjoy
unloading my shopping cart, scanning the inventory, bagging the
inventory, scanning the coupons, and scanning my credit card?
This is an interesting inventory model. I’m doing all the work —
yet I enjoy the process. Go ﬁgure.
However, supermarkets still have some work to do. Have you
ever been in a supermarket just before a potential snowstorm? I
had this unfortunate experience this past winter. One would think
the world was coming to an end. The checkout lines, regardless
of the conﬁguration I alluded to earlier, were unbelievably long
and confusing. People were actually ﬁghting with each other on
who was in front of whom. It was so crowded that you move
from line to line because of the bottlenecks at the checkout
counters. This is an inventory process that is a candidate for
improvement.

Rightsizing Inventory

Hardware stores: I saw a real interesting process improvement the
last time I went to the hardware store. I had to buy a couple of
loose bolts that were so small there was no place to put a bar-
code tag. I thought to myself, “This is going to be a real frustrating
checkout process.” Low and behold, I was pleasantly surprised.
The checkout associate had a template with bar codes and matched
up the bolt size to the appropriate template and I was on my way.
It didn’t slow down the checkout process at all.
We in supply-chain management can learn from these examples. We
need to learn to think outside the box when designing new processes in
our supply chain.
Here at Woodstock, we have an opportunity to improve our process
ﬂows dramatically. If you recall, our year-end WIP inventory was $7.5
million. Although production process ﬂow also impacts raw materials and
ﬁnished goods, it is the WIP inventory that will be affected the most by
improving the process ﬂow. I believe we can achieve a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in WIP inventory before year end by improving our process ﬂow.
Keep in mind that it must be a collaborative effort between all the links
in our supply chain. What good is a reduction in WIP inventory if all we
are doing is pushing it upstream or downstream in our supply chain and
having it sit there?
TIP #80: Pushing inventory to another upstream or down-
stream link in the supply chain will not solve your inven-
tory rightsizing problem. It will only pass the problem on
to another link in the supply chain.
You can argue that at least if it remains in raw material inventory, we
won’t be adding labor costs to it, and that would be true. But for a total
inventory reduction to occur, the inventory must be removed from the
supply chain, not just pushed somewhere else. As we improve/develop
manufacturing and distribution processes, we must also recognize that
there will be constant challenges to be faced and resolved. Some of these
challenges are:
1.
Material shortages that impede the continuous ﬂow of product
through the work cell.
2.
Product defects and scrapped product that stop or slow down
production, which reduces capacity in the work cell.
3.
Unplanned machine/equipment downtime must be kept to a
minimum.

4.
Maintaining process standards and methods as employees enter
and leave the workforce.
TIP #81: Proper design of the manufacturing process
has a signiﬁcant impact on the total inventory in the
supply chain, in general, and work-in-process inventory,
in particular. 
Process Design: Role and Responsibilities
Design of our manufacturing processes, similar to all other activities in
our supply chain, must be a collaborative effort between many links in
our supply chain. We in design engineering can’t do it alone. Process
design goes by many names. Some of the more popular names are:
manufacturing engineering, industrial engineering, or process engineering.
Here at Woodstock we call it supply-chain engineering. Although the focus
of my conversation today is on the manufacturing processes, our entire
inventory rightsizing effort is all about re-engineering the processes we
use in every single link of our supply chain. All of our meetings and
analyses have to do with ﬁnding a better way of doing things in the total
supply chain. That’s why we call it supply-chain engineering.
If I had to describe our role in one sentence it would be: “to design
supply-chain processes that reduce operating costs, increase inventory
throughput, improve employee quality of work life, and satisfy internal
and external customer requirements.” That’s it in a nutshell. If we do all
these, we will be proﬁtable. Our role is to work and communicate across
functional lines, so that changes made in one area of process design do
not have a negative impact on upstream and downstream supply-chain
processes. We have to look at the big picture and cannot work as an
island unto ourselves. That’s why what the Harmony Team is doing is so
important to the future of Woodstock.
We spoke earlier about performing concurrent engineering in the
design of our products. The same is true when we discuss our process
design. It must be done concurrently across all links in our supply chain.
TIP #82: Process design must consider the impact process
changes in a work center might have on the upstream and
downstream work centers in its path.
TIP #83: Process design cannot take place in one inventory
silo at a time. It must be a collaborative effort across all
supply-chain links.

Rightsizing Inventory
Designing Work Cells
So far, in your conversations and meetings, everyone has referred to
the different work groups on the factory ﬂoor as work centers. I would
like to talk about the concept of organizing work groups into “work
cells.” The concept of work cells is to group resources (people and
equipment) based on product families, using similar manufacturing
processes. Figure 6.2 shows the traditional process layout and the new
product layout. We are working with Arnie and his team to create a
“super cell” on the lines of a product layout similar to that shown at
the bottom of Figure 6.2.
This type of layout is ideal if the work center can be laid out in a U
shape, as shown in Figure 6.3. Think of a conference room table with
everyone sitting across from each other. Everyone sees what is going on
across the table and can easily communicate with each other. What would
happen if work center A is in one room, work center B in another, and
there was a problem at work center A? As it’s not visible, someone would
have to go to work center B to tell them there was a problem and they
should stop working. This will take time and the message might be
miscommunicated.
The U-shaped work center is conducive to a continuous ﬂow, and
work-in-process inventory will be kept at a minimum. The ideal U-shaped
cell will have cross-trained workers who can be moved around the work
cell to balance workloads. The ability of workers to communicate with
each other and provide immediate feedback is considered a big advantage
of the U-shaped work cell.

Balancing Work Operations and WIP Inventory
Let me give you an example of this workload balancing. Figure 6.4 shows
an out-of-balance work cell. There are ﬁve different steps in the assembly
process, starting with operator A and ﬁnishing with operator E. The
manufacturing time for each operation is shown in Figure 6.4. The
operation time of A is two minutes, and the operation time of B is one
minute. You will note that there is no WIP between A and B. It has dried
up. On the other hand, WIP inventory is building up between operation
B and operation C because it takes three times as long to perform
operation C as it does B. Moving on, WIP will continue to increase
between C and D because D takes longer than C. WIP will start to
decrease again between D and E because it takes less time to perform
operation E. Eventually, WIP will dry up between these two operations.
This goes against the principle of having a continuous ﬂow of product
through the work cell.

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #84: Operations and inventory ﬂows must be
sequenced and balanced in a work cell, so that inventory
ﬂows on a continuous basis without WIP inventory
increasing between operations.
As operation D is the bottleneck taking four minutes, you might
consider subordinating all operations to D’s time. But that would increase
the throughput time to 20 minutes instead of 12 (4 × 5) minutes. That
wouldn’t be a good idea. In an ideal world, all operations would be in
sync and there would be no increase or decrease in WIP inventory
between operations.
You might solve this problem by improving the processes of A, C, D,
and E to match the process time of B. This would improve the throughput
time to ﬁve minutes (1 × 5). Alternatively, you may move in more operators
to A, C, D, and E to keep the line in balance. However, that would add
to the cost. Adding people doesn’t get to the root cause and solve the
out-of-balance problem. One possible solution is to have the same oper-
ator perform operations A and B, which will take a total of two minutes
each, but you would still be out of sync with C and D. Another approach
would be to rearrange the assembly sequence.
One company I know of has come up with a unique approach to
balancing workloads between operations in a work cell. It is a “cut and
sew” operation, producing garments, mostly shirts, blouses, and
slacks/trousers (pants for men and women). It is organized into six
different work cells: two for women’s blouses; two for men’s sports shirts,
and two for pants. It has put wheels on the sewing machine tables so
that it can move them from work cell to work cell as needed, to keep
the workload balanced.
Once moved to their new temporary location, the sewing machines
are secured to the ﬂoor so that they can’t be moved easily (safety
concerns). Sewing operators are cross-trained to sew all of the garments.
Once the line is back in balance, they move the machines back to their
original location. As you can see, there are many variables that have to
be considered, including operator fatigue time. The point is, you continue
to experiment and try to get all operations in the work cell balanced so
that work ﬂows on a continuous basis, increasing throughput, and WIP
inventory becomes zero. It should be noted that any tools and ﬁxtures
required in the operation should be located in or very near the work cell.
When we ﬁnish reorganizing our assembly operations into U-shaped
work cells, we will achieve the following beneﬁts:

More efﬁcient use of ﬂoor space

Less material handling

Facility Layout
We are thinking of organizing our light (spotlights, strobes, stripe bars)
assembly area into U-shaped cells. Here is our big problem. The original
building dates back to 1942 when Woodstock was ﬁrst founded. The
original plant was 75,000 square feet and 3 stories high; then 25,000 square
feet (1 ﬂoor) were added in 1965. When the adjacent land became available
in 1985, we added on another 50,000 square feet of single-ﬂoor space.
So what we have to work with is a disjointed conglomerate of work ﬂow
and inventory movement. Figure 6.5 shows the three stages of facility
development — not a pretty picture.
As you can see, today the ofﬁces are on the third ﬂoor of the original
building. The second ﬂoor is used for the assembly of the beacon lights
and spotlights and is the area we are changing to U-shaped work cells.
The ﬁrst ﬂoor houses our manufacturing work centers. It will be difﬁcult
to move that equipment elsewhere. The 25,000-square-foot addition is
now the storeroom for inventory of ingredients and raw materials (there
is some ﬁnished goods inventory there, too). The new addition made in
1985 now houses our robotic pick and pack operation for ﬂashlights,
including a state-of-the-art conveyor box sealing system and our ﬁnished
goods inventory. We also ship and receive from this section of the plant.
We have additional storage space off site that houses our ﬁnished goods
inventory overﬂow and customer returns. Don’t forget, we also have the
distribution centers to deal with. I told Joe they should be closed down
and we should ship directly to the customers from the plant. But you
know Joe, he is thinking about it.
Due to our facility layout, inventory has to travel long distances, often
crossing the same space many times. This extra movement doesn’t add
value to our products, but it does add cost. This layout is inefﬁcient, and

240

Rightsizing Inventory
we are looking for ways to reorganize the entire facility. Quite frankly,
from our viewpoint, it would be a lot easier if we could just move into
a brand new facility that was completely empty on the inside. This is a
process design engineer’s dream — but it’s not going to happen. We just
don’t have the money to do it, so we will have to work with the space
we have.
TIP #85: Make use of existing space to store and move
inventory more effectively, rather than look to relocate to
a new facility.
Value Stream Mapping
We are in the process of developing ﬂow diagrams (process maps) of
how product moves into and out of our facility. This procedure documents
the ﬂow (routing) that products take through our entire facility, from
receiving dock to shipping dock. In addition to the product ﬂow, we have
documented the distance material moves and the time taken at each step.
These ﬂow documents are often called value stream maps. The objective
is to identify non-value-added steps in the process and improve or
eliminate them. For example, we documented the ﬂow of sheet metal
used to fabricate our spotlight assemblies. Figure 6.6 shows the ﬂow
diagram of the fabricated metal from raw material to ﬁnished product.

The dotted line represents the paper/transaction (information ﬂows), and
the solid line represents the product ﬂows.
The raw material is received (1), moved to the storeroom (3), moved
to manufacturing (5), moved back to the storeroom (6), moved to assembly
(7), moved to packing (8), moved to ﬁnished goods inventory (9), and
eventually shipped out to a customer (10). You will note that the inventory
(product) is moved eight times, transformed two times, and packed once.
The product is touched 11 times.
Of the 11 times the inventory is touched, value is added only 2 times
(manufacturing and assembly). You see there is tremendous opportunity
to improve on this, but you need to benchmark where you are before
you try to improve a process; otherwise, how will you know if you
improved it or not? Keep in mind that some of the steps may still be
necessary even though no value is added. For example, taking the sheet
metal off the truck may not add value to the product, but it is a necessary
step in the process — unless, of course, we could bring the press (200-
ton press) onto the truck and transform it right there. I don’t think so.
TIP #86: Use value stream mapping as a tool to help
identify non-value-added steps in the inventory ﬂow pro-
cess. This should include the process step, distance moved,
and the time required for each step in the inventory ﬂow.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
As you go through your value stream mapping process, question every
step in the process. One popular technique that has been used successfully
in problem solving can be used in value stream mapping. Consider the

question, “Why are we doing that?” Keep asking why until you can
determine if it is a value-added activity or not. Here is how it works:
Process ﬂow problem: There is too much WIP inventory between
operation 1 and operation 2 in assembly work cell 200. Thus,
operation 2 is determined to be a bottleneck. Relatively high
inventory waiting to be worked on between operations is consid-
ered to be wasteful (and non-value-added) and should be reduced
so that work ﬂows between operations without waiting. Keep
asking why until you get to the root cause of the problem:
Question: Why is there too much WIP inventory between opera-
tion 1 and operation 2?
Answer: Because the process times are not in balance with each
other.
Question: Why are the process times out of balance?
Answer: Because operation 2 takes twice as long as operation 1.
Question: Why does operation 2 take twice as long to complete
as operation 1?
Answer: Because it is more complicated to assemble.
Question: Why is it more complicated to assemble?
Answer: Because it was poorly designed.
Question: Why was it poorly designed?
Answer: Because the product was designed without consideration
of the manufacturing process and ﬂow.
Possible solution: Have design engineering and process engi-
neering work together to redesign the product and process con-
currently so that the process steps are in balance.
To summarize, the value stream mapping methodology is as follows:
1.
Map the current process.
2.
Benchmark where you are: touches, distance, time.
3.
Brainstorm to improve the process.
4.
Implement the improvements.
5.
Benchmark the results.
6.
If necessary, go back to step 3.
7.
If successful, go back to step 1 and repeat the sequence.
Maybe I should amend the steps in value stream mapping to start with
educating the workforce. In fact, I would strongly suggest that any process
design effort should include education and training as the ﬁrst step.
Operators should understand the total process. I realize that a lot of what
is going on in the inventory rightsizing effort has to do with a complete

education program for all employees. I believe this is an excellent
approach to all we do in the future here at Woodstock.
Takt Time and Inventory Production Rates
As I’ve said, we are going to reorganize our assembly work centers into
U-shaped work cells, based on manufacturing product families. Our goal
is to have a continuous ﬂow of product going through the work cells,
with a minimum of wait time and WIP inventory between operations. We
are going to have a “single-piece ﬂow” where one unit at a time is passed
from assembler to assembler as each assembler completes his or her part
of the total assembly process.
Conceptually, this will decrease process lead time and increase capac-
ity. The idea is any process lead time saved can be used to produce more
units. We are going to establish takt times as a measurement of ﬁnished
goods inventory output. Takt time is a method of establishing production
rates to match the rate of customer demand or, in the case of our make-
to-stock products, forecast demand. It measures the rate at which a
completely assembled ﬁnished product exits the work cell. It has been
called the “heart beat” or “pulse rate” of a work cell. The formula is
Let me show you how this works. I will use the new compact lantern
as an example. Right now the plan is to design a U-shaped work cell.
Table 6.2 shows the number of assembly operations and the time required
at each operation. You will note that the assembly of this product requires
four assembly operators, with each operation requiring one minute to
complete, for a total assembly time of four minutes per unit (for now,
until the process is actually designed).

Rightsizing Inventory
The lantern can be made and sold in three color combinations:
Black/gray
Black/red
Black/green
They are packed and sold in lots of 24 per carton with a standard mix
of 8 lanterns per color combination per carton. The forecast is 50,000
units for the ﬁrst year of production and the test marketplace for the ﬁrst
year is the northeastern United States only. Our plan is to produce all
50,000 units in the ﬁrst quarter of next year (January to March). If sales
go as well as projected, we will go into full production by midyear and
sell the product worldwide.
Getting back to our example, we will have two similar work cells with
four operators in each work cell, working eight hours a day, ﬁve days a
week. Allowing for two ten-minute breaks and one ten-minute “cleanup”
at the end of the shift, the total available time is
8 – .5 = 7.5 × 4 =
30 hours of total available time per day in each work cell
Computed in minutes, the total available time is 1,800 minutes (30 ×
60 minutes) per day. Establishing two work cells will give us a total
available time of 3,600 minutes (1,800 × 2) per day. I looked at the
manufacturing calendar for the ﬁrst quarter of next year, and excluding
weekends and holidays, there are 63 work days. As the current plan calls
for producing all 50,000 units in the ﬁrst quarter, we will have to assemble
794 units per day (50,000/63). Applying the takt time formula, we calculate
takt time as follows:
For both cells: 3,600/794 = 4.5
for one cell: 1,800/397 = 4.5
This means that one unit should exit the work cells every 4.5 minutes.
Because our studies show that we can produce one unit every 4 minutes
(see Figure 6.6), this is a reasonable assumption. As a precaution, we are
going to assign one extra person as “ﬂoater,” who will ﬂoat between both
cells and assist if any bottlenecks occur. Remember, this is a labor-intensive
process with a minimal amount of training required to perform all four
operations. The only tool required is a screwdriver, so equipment isn’t an
issue. If all goes well and sales come in as forecast, we will look to
automate as much of this assembly work as possible. The product design
team will also continue to look for ways to improve the product DFM.

Product and Process Design to Minimize


We plan to install an electronic takt board system that will scan each
unit as it exits the work cell, so that we can measure takt time required
for actual production. If we fall behind we can add more people; if we
get ahead of schedule, we can take people out and use them elsewhere
in the plant.
Keep in mind that we have made certain assumptions. There is the
“real world” and there is the “ideal world.” In the ideal world, this is how
it will happen. In the real world, we have to face reality, which says it
won’t happen this way. We assume that the customers will pull 794 units
per day and we can ship them. You and I both know the customers won’t
order based on our assumptions. We must also be prepared to ramp up
or ramp down production based on customers’ ordering needs. Remember
takt time is based on actual demand, and we have used forecast demand,
not the best use of takt time, but it does give us an order of magnitude
to plan for.
How does takt time relate to our inventory rightsizing efforts? It helps
in the following ways:

It gives us a benchmark and performance metric of how much
inventory we need to produce in the given time.

It allows us to plan material requirements to meet production
requirements.

Work-in-process inventory will be kept to a minimum.

Inventory will ﬂow on a continuous basis.

We can adjust inventory levels based on takt time versus actual
production.
Even if takt time isn’t the right tool for this particular work cell, it is
an excellent tool that we can apply to other work centers in our plant.
Process design and takt time can work well together, which is the point
of my conversation.
TIP #87: Takt time is a tool that can be used to monitor
actual customer demand against actual production, so
that adjustments can be made to keep inventory supply
and demand in balance.
Mistake-Prooﬁng the Process
Mistake-prooﬁng, sometimes referred to as “poka yoke,” is a technique of
preventing an error from occurring in a process to avoid product defects.
In designing a new process, or improving an existing process, consideration

246

Rightsizing Inventory
should be given to preventing defects from occurring because of poor
process design. Although primarily focused on machine setups, poka-yoke
techniques can be applied to many areas in the supply chain. Mistakes
that result in damaged or poor quality goods mean you may have to use
more inventory to replace bad inventory — not a good solution to the
problem. Some examples of mistake-prooﬁng include the following:

Color matching parts so that two like colors get assembled together

Designing parts so that they can only be ﬁt together one way

Designing machine ﬁxtures that can only be applied to a machine
in one way, and will not move out of place during production
Mistake-prooﬁng comes in many forms and shapes. It can be technol-
ogy driven (hardware/software), procedural, visual, or manual tasks. I
must point out that most times simpler is better. Let me give you an
example of a supposedly mistake-proof method that failed in a highly
sophisticated automated pick and pack environment. Product was picked
by robots and placed in a bar-coded labeled carton that moved along a
conveyor belt to a highly sensitive scale to verify the weight of the carton
and its contents.
After scanning the label, the system calculated what the total weight
should be, and then the carton would move along the conveyor belt to
the box-sealing machine, where it was taped shut. After leaving the sealing
machine the carton passed by a scanner, which veriﬁed that it was the
correct weight, and then moved on to the shipping area to be packed on
skids and moved out the door on to a waiting truck.
If the scanner indicated an incorrect weight, the carton would not
move on to the shipping area. It would continue to travel on the conveyor
belt to a quality assurance area where they would open up the box to
verify the carton contents and correct if necessary. Sounds like a pretty
good way to mistake-proof a process and catch errors, right? Here’s where
the story gets interesting.
One day, they ran out of the correct carton size and had to substitute
a larger carton. Needless to say, every time a substitute carton passed by
the scanner, it was ﬂagged as having an incorrect weight and sent on to
the quality assurance area for item veriﬁcation. The scale was saying that
something was wrong. The packed carton was a higher weight than it
should be and possibly had more product than it should.
The net result was they had to open over 1000 cartons to verify the
contents and then manually reseal every one of them. They couldn’t
recalibrate the scale because multiple robots were picking multiple prod-
ucts, packed in boxes of various sizes, and they all passed along the same
conveyor system (and scale) randomly. Can you imagine the cost and


247
time spent correcting a mistake-proof system? The moral of the story: keep
your mistake-prooﬁng process as simple as possible — and never, ever
run out of packing boxes.
The goal of process design is to design processes where inventory
ﬂows in a continuous way throughout the supply chain. Similar to water
ﬂowing through a pipe, the design process should allow for a continuous,
nonstop ﬂow, maximizing throughput times and minimizing lead times.
Any activity not adding value to the product should be questioned and
minimized, or eliminated if possible.
Well, I guess that’s it. I’m sure you will hear more about process design
when you meet with the warehouse and distribution teams. I hope I was
able to help. If you should need anything else, please do not hesitate to
ask. I consider myself a team player and will help in any way I can.

losophy rather than a sequential design process. A
sequential process is inefﬁcient, prone to costly
errors, and takes too long.
4.
Concurrent 
engineering 
is 
a 
cross-functional
approach to product design. We are getting all of our
supply-chain links involved in the very beginning of
the product design phase, including our external cus-
tomers and suppliers.

5.
Products will be designed with a focus on DFM and DFA.
6.
We are also asking our buyers’ customers (end users)
to participate.
7.
We have purchased our competitors’ products and are
reverse engineering them to gain an understanding
of their product (part) content and assembly process.
8.
Our design objectives include using fewer parts,
using standard off-the-shelf parts, and combining
several different parts into one.
9.
Consideration will also be given to how we can
improve product packaging for ease of movement

11.
A real plus to our inventory rightsizing efforts will
be designing future products using an inventory
postponement strategy.
12.
We have hired two summer interns who will be ana-
lyzing our existing inventory and providing us with a
list of part numbers that we may be able to use as
substitutes, without a negative impact on product
form, ﬁt, or function.

Rightsizing Inventory
Applying Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to Your Company
In Chapter 6, we added 14 new TIPS and covered product design and
process design. These two critical links focus on the demand side of the
equation, but product design relies heavily on input from the demand
side, in particular the input from customers on how to best design products
that meet their needs and requirements. As you have learned, process
design is a real challenge to Woodstock because of the old, antiquated
facility it has to deal with.
I once consulted for a company with a facility similar to Woodstock’s.
But in this example, the company deliberately chose the facility. Under
a state grant program it was able to obtain an old three-story manufacturing
facility, right in the heart of a very populated city. The only means of
transportation between ﬂoors was one old elevator that was converted
from steam to electric. Needless to say, when the elevator broke down,
nothing moved until it was ﬁxed.
An analysis of manufacturing productivity showed that the company’s
overall efﬁciency was 66 percent of standard. Most of the inefﬁciency was
attributed to the inefﬁcient plant layout and poor process ﬂows. A similar
study would probably show Woodstock to be as inefﬁcient. I point this
out because some of the readers may face a similar set of circumstances
and can identify with the challenges facing Woodstock. Let’s review the
TIPS and discuss how they can be applied to your company:
TIP #74: Any drastic changes in your MRP data may cause
inventory levels to rise, until inventory is rebalanced and
adjusted to the new planning requirements. Over time, it
will begin to correct itself and decrease accordingly.
Typically, with the initial implementation of MRP, inventory levels will
rise. This is due to the fact that inventories may have to be rebalanced.
You will need to buy things you thought you had enough of, and you will
have to work off inventory (reduce) that you have too much of. In time,
inventory will start to go down, and if you continue to use MRP effectively,
you will see dramatic decreases in overall inventory levels. A reduction of
25 percent to 35 percent is not unheard of after 12 to 18 months. Even
experienced MRP users will experience out-of-balance inventory levels if
the “BILL of Integrity” (BOI discussed in Chapter 5) isn’t correct. The BOI
addresses four critical pieces of information that must be accurate:
1.
Bill of material
2.
Inventory records

Product and Process Design to Minimize

251
3.
Lead times
4.
Lot-size rules
This accuracy won’t happen on its own. It will require diligence and
hard work. To ensure your BOI is at the highest possible level, I suggest you:
1.
Establish performance standards (level of accuracy) that must be met.
2.
Measure actual performance to standard.
3.
Establish a policy and procedure to bring the BOI back to standard
when it is out of the acceptable range.
4.
Assign responsibility for each of the four BOIs of information.
5.
Assign responsibility cross-functionally (more than one link held
accountable).
6.
Recognize teams (people) for outstanding performance.
TIP #75: Product design has a major impact on inventory
costs through every link in the supply chain. The design
must become a cross-functional process with inputs from
all links in the supply chain, including suppliers and
customers.
Every single link in your supply chain can make a positive contribution
to product design. The key points to be made here as follows:
1.
Get all links involved to some degree. They don’t have to be
involved full time.
2.
Get them involved early in the design phase. By early, I mean get
them involved from the beginning.
3.
Make sure to include your key suppliers and customers.
4.
Find out what your competition is doing. Reverse engineer their
products.
5.
Mistakes made at the design phase will be less costly than if the
product were made and shipped to the customer.
6.
Most of your product cost is determined in the design phase.
7.
Designing products with fewer parts will reduce costs and increase
productivity.
8.
Designing products with standard (as opposed to custom-made)
parts will reduce costs.
9.
It is imperative that the product as well as processes to make it
are designed at the same time. 

252

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #76: Designing products collaboratively with other
links in the supply chain can beneﬁt your inventory right-
sizing effort by eliminating or reducing the total number
and variety of parts that have to be planned for and
stocked in inventory.
Most of the points related to this TIP were covered in TIP #75. However,
I wanted to highlight some important points here. Although the focus on
designing a product is on satisfying the customer requirements, your
company still needs to make a proﬁt. You can help accomplish this by:
1.
Keeping the total number of parts in your product to a minimum.
2.
Reducing the variety of parts in your product.
3.
Using standard off-the-shelf parts rather than custom-made parts.
If you can achieve these three objectives, the following costs would
reduce considerably:

Cost of the part itself

Cost of the labor employed on your product

Cost of planning for it

Cost of ordering it

Cost of carrying it in inventory

Cost of moving it

Cost of transportation

Cost of a stockout
No single silo can accomplish these objectives by itself. It will require
a collaborative effort by the entire supply chain, including customers and
suppliers.
TIP #77: Use an inventory postponement strategy that
shifts product differentiation as far downstream as possi-
ble, so that ﬁnal inventory conﬁguration is committed
when customer requirements are known.
The principle you want to follow using this TIP is, “Add value to your
raw materials as far downstream in your supply chain as possible.” Adding
value too early in your process will cause you many problems you will
have to deal with later. Consider this scenario: You buy raw materials and
build a completed, ﬁnished product and put it into inventory. The sales
forecast changes (downward) and you get stuck with the product. You
have several choices:

Product and Process Design to Minimize

253
1.
Continue to carry it in stock in the hope that you can sell it at a
later time. Now you are dealing with carrying cost.
2.
Reduce the selling price to move it out of inventory. This will
erode your proﬁt margins, and in fact, you may lose money on
the sale.
3.
Reverse engineer the product. Take it apart and use the parts
for some other product. This will add to your cost and also
reduce your capacity. In all probability, you will lose money
taking this step.
4.
Scrap the product. This is a last-ditch solution. If you have to take
this approach, one wonders if you had a market for the product
in the ﬁrst place. I have seen this happen, though.
How can you put off committing raw materials into a ﬁnal product
until later?

Seek to decrease your raw material purchases lead time.

Look to decrease your manufacturing lead time.

Put off adding product options until the sale is made and the order
is taken.

Build your product modularly so that modules can be conﬁgured
and added in the ﬁnal assembly process.

Seek to increase your manufacturing ﬂexibility and response time.

Increase your supply-chain velocity.
TIP #78: Look to substitute existing inventory into a prod-
uct, rather than going out to buy a similar part, if the
substituted part can perform the same form, ﬁt, and func-
tion to meet and satisfy customer expectations.
Too often in my experience I’ve seen a company expedite a raw
material, pay a premium freight charge to ﬂy it in, break a machine setup,
work overtime, and then ship the part out at a premium freight charge
— having all the time a perfectly acceptable raw material in stock that it
could have used. To add salt to the wound, the substitute raw material
was sitting around in inventory with no commitments for it. Don’t let this
happen to you.
Woodstock is taking a good approach to this issue. It is hiring a couple
of summer interns who are going to analyze raw material and subassemble
inventory to see if the slow-moving/inactive inventory can be used else-
where. It will have to work closely with the experienced product design
engineers as they go through this process. It will take a great deal of time
to accomplish, but it is time well spent.

254

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #79: A formal, structured part numbering system
should be used. Item codes should be kept as short and
simple as possible to eliminate the potential for translation
errors, which may impede your inventory rightsizing
efforts.
There are several points to consider when applying this TIP:
1.
Have only one supply-chain link assign new part numbers. In
many companies this will be design engineering, but it doesn’t
have to be.
2.
Have a formal process of requesting and assigning a new part
number (or changing an existing one).
3.
Use a part number only once. Do not reassign it to another part.
4.
Develop and maintain a “part number master” within your formal
system.
5.
Develop and maintain a cross-reference list of sales part numbers
and your internal part numbers.
6.
Develop and maintain a cross-reference list of customer part num-
bers and your part numbers.
TIP #80: Pushing inventory to another upstream or down-
stream link in the supply chain will not solve your inven-
tory rightsizing problem. It will only pass the problem on
to another link in the supply chain.
In the early days of “just-in-time” (JIT), many companies attempted to
push inventory back to suppliers, who in turn tried to push the inventory
back to their suppliers. If every supply chain was able to push inventory
back successfully, we would have pushed it back to our natural resources.
Very few companies are able to do this. Henry Ford was an early
(successful) pioneer of this concept. Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked out
all that well for others. There were several reasons for this:
1.
In some cases, there wasn’t mutual beneﬁt to both parties.
2.
The cost of JIT was prohibitive.
3.
Stockouts were a serious problem.
4.
Planning was complex and ever changing.
5.
It was a big culture change to many companies.
If you can address these ﬁve points successfully, then JIT will work
for you. However, within the internal supply chain, inventories must be
balanced and rightsized. Pushing inventory back upstream will only cause

Product and Process Design to Minimize

255
the problem to shift to another link in the supply chain without resulting
in this balance. It must be a coordinated approach and an integrated
solution; internal and external customer service must not suffer because
of it.
TIP #81: Proper design of the manufacturing process
has a signiﬁcant impact on the total inventory in the
supply chain in general and work-in-process inventory
in particular.
The objective of designing manufacturing processes properly is to elim-
inate non-value-added steps and improve the value-added steps, so that
costs are kept low and efﬁciency high. The ideal process will have a balanced,
continuous ﬂow of product with minimal WIP inventory sitting in queue,
waiting to be worked on. You can help accomplish this objective by:
1.
Designing the product and the manufacturing process at the same
time. 
2.
Making your suppliers part of the process design team.
3.
Having your suppliers see and understand your manufacturing
process, and how their product is transformed into your product.
4.
Visiting your suppliers to see and understand how they build the
raw material for you.
5.
Staying on top of the latest technological advances in manufac-
turing productivity, including machine, information, and process
technologies.
6.
Benchmarking the recognized “best of breed” for that process.
7.
Having customers involved in improving and designing your
processes.
8.
Conducting “process time studies” to ensure workload balances,
and identifying process bottlenecks where WIP inventory has the
potential to get out of balance.
TIP #82: Process design must consider the impact process
changes in a work center might have on the upstream and
downstream work centers in its path.
We spoke earlier of not pushing inventory back upstream in the supply
chain because inventories would get out of balance and cause all sorts
of problems. The same is true of manufacturing processes. If you change
(improve) the process in one work center, you must analyze the impact
on the upstream and downstream work centers. Why? Because it could
cause a bottleneck at those work centers.

256

Rightsizing Inventory
If an imbalance occurs, WIP inventory can build up or dry up, and in
both cases, this would not be a good thing. It would result in stockouts
and late orders, and an increase in WIP could also increase total lead
times throughout the supply chain. To prevent this from happening,
conduct an analysis of total process times of a product’s routing through
the supply chain. Communicate about any imbalances to all other links
in the chain, and realign processes accordingly.
TIP #83: Process design cannot take place in one inventory
silo at a time. It must be a collaborative effort across all
supply-chain links.
Product design and process design must occur concurrently, as men-
tioned in the Woodstock story. Mistakes caught in the early stages of
development will be less costly. The days of designing a product and
then throwing it “over the wall” to other links are gone forever. A side
beneﬁt not yet mentioned is that the total design time will be greatly
reduced by not performing the process one step at a time. The general
principle to be applied here is “get other supply links involved early and
often in the design of both products and processes.”
TIP #84: Operations and inventory ﬂows must be
sequenced and balanced in a work cell, so that inventory
ﬂows on a continuous basis without WIP inventory
increasing between operations.
We spoke earlier of balancing inventory and process ﬂows in work
cells, and we used an example of rebalancing in the Woodstock case
study. In some cases, you may perform multiple operations in the same
work cell. The obvious approach is that to balance workloads work cell
to work cell, you must balance operations within a work cell ﬁrst. To use
this TIP effectively, the balancing of workloads cannot be made at the
expense of the continuous ﬂow of product through your processes. When
you rebalance workloads, keep the concept of continuous ﬂow foremost
in your mind.
TIP #85: Make use of existing space to store and move
inventory more effectively, rather than look to relocate to
a new facility.
If your current facility is an old building with many ﬂoors, you are at
a disadvantage in trying to improve the ﬂow of inventory through the
facility, unless your manufacturing process requires multiple ﬂoors. How-

Product and Process Design to Minimize

257
ever, if you own the facility and it is in a great location for transportation
of products and easily accessible to employees, it might be worth rede-
signing, and every effort should be made to do so.
To make effective use of the space, begin by:
1.
Creating process maps of how the product currently ﬂows through
the facility.
2.
Eliminating/improving process steps by eliminating non-value-
added steps.
3.
Redesigning the new process on paper (computer models) before
implementation.
4.
Conducting a 5s campaign (Chapter 7).
5.
Finding a place for everything and putting everything in its place.
TIP #86: Use value stream mapping as a tool to help
identify non-value-added steps in the inventory ﬂow pro-
cess. This should include the process step, distance moved,
and the time required for each step in the inventory ﬂow.
Value stream mapping (VSM) is essentially a process ﬂow chart of
activities/processes that occur in your supply chain. Once you have
identiﬁed and agreed on the process ﬂow, you can identify all non-value-
added activities taking place and eliminate them, or in the worse case,
try to improve upon them. Conceptually, the only activities left are value-
added activities that the customer is willing to pay for. Once you have
eliminated the non-value-added activities, you can then try to improve
the value-added activities, making them more effective.
From my experience, the biggest challenge you face in developing
value stream maps is getting everyone to agree on what the current process
is. At this level of mapping you don’t need to go into a lot of detail, but
it should be detailed enough for everyone to understand the overall
process. If more detail is needed, you can “drill down” through each
activity and create sublevel process maps.
Challenge every activity. Don’t take any process step for granted. Ask
yourself, “Why are we doing that step?” Continue with this question until
you are satisﬁed the step is needed; if not, eliminate it. Keep the people
side of the equation out of the process. By that I mean, don’t worry about
what you will do with an employee if a step is eliminated. There are
probably plenty of other (value-added) tasks for an employee to perform
in other areas of the supply chain.
TIP #87: Takt time is a tool that can be used to monitor
actual customer demand against actual production, so

258

Rightsizing Inventory
that adjustments can be made to keep inventory supply
and demand in balance.
Takt time is a technique of matching production rates to customer
demand. It sets the rate (pace) required to meet the demand. An example
related to Woodstock was given earlier in this chapter. This is a technique
popular with companies that have initiated a “lean production” environment.
Before initiating the use of takt time, have a program in place to
bring the takt time back into balance when it lags behind the demand
rate. The worst you can do is implement a takt time production envi-
ronment, and watch as the system reports you are getting further and
further behind, with no plan in place to correct the problem. Morale
will suffer, and convincing employees to continue to try to meet the
takt time will be difﬁcult. Table 6.3 represents the most current status
of the Woodstock inventory, and Table 6.4 shows a Pareto order of
Woodstock inventory reduction.

How Much Inventory 
Should We Make?
May 29, Harmony Team Meeting
Woodstock Inventory: $38.1 Million
My name is Orlando, and I am the assistant plant manager of
Woodstock Lighting Group.
I’ve been working here for 15 years, and this is the ﬁrst time I’ve been asked
to participate in a group discussion other than with our own internal
manufacturing staff. I wonder what that’s all about. Usually Arnie does
all the communicating with the other links in the chain. He likes to be the
only one talking to outside groups. I don’t know what he is afraid of. Maybe,
he thinks I will say something stupid, or maybe he’s afraid others will realize
that I know a lot about what’s going on and start coming to me for ideas
and questions.
I started out as a machine operator in the machine shop and worked
my way up to ﬂoor supervisor, and then assistant plant manager. I’m ready
to be promoted to plant manager. I hope Arnie gets Joe’s job soon, so I can
move up. Joe doesn’t have a clue about what’s going on. We waste more
time explaining things to him than it’s worth. Arnie is more patient than me.
I think this whole Harmony Team thing is good for the company. The
good news is it will give me a chance to interact with other people who I
know by name but have never met. This will be good for my career. The
bad news is that ever since Arnie took on the team leader role, he has been

262

Rightsizing Inventory
inaccessible, and I’ve taken over many of his day-to-day tasks. Now I have
to work 12 to 15 hours a day. It seems like I just get home and it’s time to
get up and go back to work again. I’m really tired, and this concerns me.
I’m afraid I will make mistakes and use poor judgment.
Management might view this as a negative when the time comes to
consider me as a candidate for the plant manager position when it becomes
available.
How much inventory should we make? We constantly ask ourselves
that question every day. Balancing supply with demand is an ever-
changing formula, and we strive to get it right. However, as you can see
from the amount of inventory in our supply chain, we need to reduce
and “rightsize” our raw material and work-in-process (WIP) inventory. At
the beginning of the year, we had $17 million in raw material inventory
and another $7.5 million in WIP. Our raw material inventory alone was
higher than our ﬁnished goods inventory, which was $15.5 million at the
end of the year. Well, we are ﬁve months into a new year, and we are
showing some improvement. You heard from Michael that we want to
reduce WIP by the year end. We are working hard to do it. I believe we
will make it happen.
I’m sure he mentioned to you all the process improvements we are
making as we convert some of our work centers to U-shaped work cells.
Today, I would like to discuss other aspects of manufacturing that are
related to our inventory rightsizing efforts. The areas I will address will
impact both our raw material and our WIP inventories. Our manufacturing
environment is a mixture of a job shop and a ﬂow shop.
The primary work centers are our pressroom W/C #201 and our
machine shop W/C #301. The assembly work cells are on the second
ﬂoor. Work cells #401 and #402 are for the light bars, and work cells #501
and #502 are for the new compact lantern product line. We also have
one work center dedicated to beacon light assembly, W/C #101. The
pressroom, W/C #201, has four presses of various tonnages. The machine
shop, W/C #301, has six machines consisting of one lathe, one drill press,
one sanding/deburring machine, and three CNC machines. The assembly
work cells are mostly manual today, with very little automation. One of
the challenges we face constantly is that our bottlenecks move around to
different work centers and different machines from day to day.
Tip #88: In a job-shop manufacturing environment, the
bottleneck operation is not stationary. It is constantly
shifting from work center to work center and will create
an imbalance of your WIP inventory.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

263
For example, last week the bottleneck was in the CNC area, where
we had two machines down for unplanned maintenance. This week it
was the pressroom, where we had a capacity overload on the 200-ton
press. In both cases, the WIP inventory backed up and orders were late.
This made a lot of people unhappy, least of whom were sales, who were
pressing (no pun intended) for delivery on an impact order.
Role and Responsibilities
Our primary responsibility is to produce quality products and to meet the
requirements of the master production schedule (MPS); but we do so
much more than that. Here is a summary of our responsibilities:

Meet the requirements of the MPS: Planning publishes (updates)
the MPS on a weekly basis. We are measured on our performance
to schedule. I don’t believe this is a good barometer to measure
our performance. There are too many schedule changes (during
the week), and the sales team is constantly inserting new impact
orders into the schedule.

Meet the requirements of the ﬁnal assembly schedule (FAS):
In addition to the MPS, planning also publishes an FAS for the
assembly work cells. We do a little better with the FAS than we
do with the MPS. Most of the incoming orders are for customers,
rather than a mix of customers and stock replenishment.

Effective utilization of resources to meet the MPS and the
FAS: In manufacturing, we consider a resource to be raw materials,
subassemblies, machines, tools, jigs, equipments, or personnel (and
money, budgets permitting).

Rightsizing Inventory
Capacity Management and Inventory
Capacity management is the activity of balancing workload (demand) and
resources (supply) to meet the priorities established in the MPS and the
FAS. The major tasks to achieve this balance are:
Planning: Establishing schedules and priorities
Execution: Releasing work orders, assigning work
Monitor output: Tracking work orders’ progress through the plant
Control: Adjusting supply and demand
In an earlier meeting, Cyndie spoke about developing the MPS and then
performing rough-cut capacity planning (RCCP). Figure 7.1 shows the
planning process and ﬂow discussed by Cyndie.
We are discussing the decision point titled plant capacity (internal). If
capacity and workload are not in balance, you have two choices: ﬁnd the
capacity to meet the MPS, or go back up the planning hierarchy and
adjust the MPS. Conceptually, the last thing you want to do is adjust the
MPS. Every effort should be made to meet the MPS as scheduled. No one
wants to reschedule orders, particularly if they are actual customer orders.
However, reality must set in, and the planning process must be followed.
If you don’t have the capacity to meet the workload for a given period,
then orders will be completed later than scheduled. The condition is
compounded if the late orders are not rescheduled. You now have an
order backlog and, in all likelihood, an invalid MPS.
Why is balancing capacity and workload important to our inventory
rightsizing efforts? If you have less capacity than demand, WIP inventory
will increase. If WIP increases, total manufacturing lead time will increase.
The result is that inventory will become unbalanced between work centers.
If, on the other hand, you have more capacity than demand, WIP will
decrease and eventually dry up. Although the decrease in inventory may
be viewed as a positive condition, it may cause a work center to shut
down. You will lose that capacity. Again, the result is that inventory will
become unbalanced.
As shown in Figure 7.2, there is a direct relationship between lead
time and capacity. Consider this scenario:
1.
Demand for your product is greater than your capacity to produce it.
2.
You can’t catch up, and your backlog of orders grows.
3.
As a result, it will take you longer to complete the orders you already
have, so you have to increase the order lead time for new orders.
4.
You tell your sales team to advise your customers that the lead
time has increased.

Rightsizing Inventory
5.
The customers, in turn, give you more orders because of the
increased lead time. They want to be covered and not have a
stockout.
6.
The result of this process is you have more orders and your backlog
grows again. What do you do? You again have to increase your
lead time, and the customers give you more orders to cover the
additional lead time. The process is now out of control and
continues to repeat itself in a closed-loop, never-ending sequence.
Someone looks at this huge backlog and decides to invest in
additional capacity. You let the customers know you are catching
up and will begin to ship their orders earlier than originally
scheduled. Because the customers really don’t need the orders
earlier, they cancel them or postpone delivery to a future date.
Now you have excess capacity and questionable orders on the
books, all leading to higher inventories.
TIP #89: If supply (capacity) and demand (workload) are
not in balance, the change in inventory will negatively
impact your inventory rightsizing efforts.
Load Proﬁle Report
A popular tool to analyze supply and demand is the load proﬁle report.
Table 7.1 is an example of this report.

What you are looking at here is a planning grid, comparing the
workload (orders and planned orders) to the available capacity (produc-
tion) in our machine shop, work center #301. Let’s calculate the available
capacity ﬁrst. The ﬁrst data we need is the total available time in the work
center. Capacity can be calculated (estimated) and then measured. It was
mentioned earlier that we have three CNC machines in this work center.
Each machine requires one operator. We operate work center #301 two
shifts per day, ﬁve days per week. Thus the formula is
M × H × D = Total available time
M = Machines
H = Hours (per day)
D = Days (per week)
3 × 16 × 5 = 240
TIP #90: Calculate capacity based on your normal work
week. If you normally operate ﬁve days a week, then
calculate your capacity based on ﬁve days. If you always
operate seven days a week, then you can calculate your
capacity based on seven days.
As you can see, work center #301 has a total of 240 available hours.
However, we can’t base our capacity solely on this ﬁgure. It has to be
adjusted for utilization and efﬁciency.
Utilization
Utilization is the time the machine is actively producing parts. The machine
operator is available for 8 hours per shift. Lunch time was already elim-
inated. Employees are on site 8.5 hours per shift, and lunch time is 30
minutes; so we are down to 8 hours. Employees in our shop get two

10-minute breaks, and another 10 minutes at the end of their shift to clean
up their work area and to wash up. The 30 minutes are deducted from
the 8 hours, and we are down to 7.5 hours. There are always unforeseen
activities going on, such as bathroom breaks, phone calls, and discussions
with supervisors. We try to err on the side of caution and adjust out 30
minutes. I know that’s a lot, but right or wrong, it’s a reality here at
Woodstock. So we are down to 7 hours per operator. Given these numbers,
our utilization is 88 percent.
7/8 × 100 percent = 0.875 = 88 percent utilization
Efﬁciency
Efﬁciency is actual output compared to the expected (standard) output.
For example, if the standard is 30 minutes per piece going through the
CNC center and we actually take 25 minutes, our efﬁciency is 120 percent.
30/25 × 100 percent = 120 percent efﬁciency
On the other hand, if the standard is 30 minutes per piece, and it
actually takes 35 minutes, our efﬁciency is 86 percent.
30/35 × 100 percent = 85.7 = 86 percent efﬁciency
You will notice that efﬁciency in our ﬁrst example was 120 percent,
and in our second it was only 86 percent. This wide disparity does actually
occur from time to time. In the former example, we might have had our
best operator on the job, and in the latter we might have had a new
operator with little experience, and thus the disparity. When estimating
capacity available, we use the standard efﬁciency. If over time we con-
sistently go over 100 percent, we look at the standard and adjust it (with
approval of manufacturing, engineering, and cost accounting).
Based on historical data, work center #301 has an average efﬁciency
of 90 percent, so I’ll use that to calculate capacity. Now we have the total
available time, efﬁciency, and utilization. Let’s put it all together and see
what we get:
Calculated capacity = Total available time × utilization × efﬁciency
240 × 0.88 × 0.90 = 190 hours per week of capacity
This number is reﬂected in Table 7.1 on the line titled, “capacity.” You
will note that this load proﬁle shows ﬁve weeks. That’s because this

happens to be the month of August, which is a ﬁve-week month. This is
probably a good time to point out that whether a month has four or ﬁve
weeks is based on the company’s ﬁscal calendar, established by Pat in
ﬁnance and agreed to by the other links. Each quarter has thirteen weeks;
thus, our ﬁscal calendar comprises four-, four-, and ﬁve-week periods in
each quarter. We in production then take the ﬁscal calendar and develop
what we call our “manufacturing shop calendar.” This is based on the
number of actual days the plant is open for business and functioning.
Figure 7.3 shows our shop calendar for the month of September.
You will note that the month starts on a Sunday, September 1. The
shaded square in the box is blank, indicating that it is not a work day.
Monday, September 2, is also a nonwork day (Labor Day in the United
States). Starting with Tuesday, September 3, you will see the number 1
in the box, indicating it is the ﬁrst work day of the month. All work days
are numbered sequentially. Figure 7.3 shows that there are 20 work days
in September. The shop calendar usually starts in January, and work days
are sequential and cumulative. If we work 240 days a year, the ﬁrst work
day is work day #1, and the last work day is #240. Sometimes the shop
calendar continues for years. If it is a 4-year calendar, the last work day
of year 4 would be work day #960 (assuming 240 work days per year).
Why is a shop calendar important? Without this input, our enterprise
resource planning (ERP) system would be scheduling work on weekends,
holidays, and other planned shutdowns. You can imagine the chaos this
would cause.

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #91: Make sure your shop calendar is adjusted each
year to account for nonwork days. Failure to do so will
hinder your inventory rightsizing efforts.
Workload
So far we have talked about how capacity is calculated. You will note
that I was very conservative in our estimates. Now let’s talk about work-
load. Table 7.1 has two lines entitled, “released orders and “planned
orders.” This is what we call workload: the amount of work in standard
hours that has to be done in the work center. Our system reviews each
order and tabulates the amount of time required to complete each order.
The numbers plotted on the grid in Table 7.1 reﬂect the workload in W/C
#301. If you wanted to get technical, I could point out that, on a strictly
monthly calculation, the ﬁrst and ﬁfth week would not have 190 hours
because there is a monthly overlap. But this is how we do it today.
You can see that weeks 1 and 2 have excess capacity, week 3 is short
10 hours, week 4 is short 20 hours, and week 5 has excess capacity. On
a cumulative basis, we have enough capacity for the month. However,
we will experience some late orders in weeks 3 and 4. If you were a
planner, what is the ﬁrst thing you would do? Remember, we are at the
end of May, and this load proﬁle is for a future month. If your immediate
reaction is to reschedule some of the load for week 3 to week 2, you
might want to rethink. Why? You will note that the load in week 3 consists
of 100 hours of released load and 100 hours of planned load. The planned
load is just that: a planned load. It may or may not happen. More than
likely, this information came from our MRP system as a planned order.
Going back up the planning grid, MRP got its input from the MPS.
The MPS got its input from actual orders (among other inputs) and forecast.
Well, if the 100 hours of planned input don’t happen, we will actually
have an excess capacity of 90 hours! So the ﬁrst thing you want to do is
validate the planned releases. If they are real, then we can talk about
rescheduling orders into weeks 1 and 2. However, you may not be able
to move the workload in because the raw materials may not be available,
as you are a week early.
All this is food for thought. That’s what planning is all about: looking
at the information and making adjustments to balance supply and demand.
The load proﬁle is a good tool for other links as well. If you have another
work center that is really backlogged, you may want to take a machine
operator out of work center #301 and move him or her to the overloaded
work center. Of course, this assumes the operator is cross-trained for the
other work center. Even the human resources staff can beneﬁt from looking
at this chart. For example, if they were planning to show a safety video

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

271
to employees in work center #301, they shouldn’t schedule it for week 3
or week 4. It looks like the best time to show the tape would be in week
5, assuming the operators weren’t moved to another work center. The
point is, this report is a tool that can be used as a point of discussion in
making decisions. The load proﬁle depicted in Table 7.1 can also be
displayed in chart format, as shown in Figure 7.4.
TIP #92: Develop a load proﬁle report by work center.
Distribute it to all appropriate links in the supply chain
so that each upstream and downstream link can use it as
a tool to make decisions that impact inventory levels in
the entire supply chain.
Lean Manufacturing and Inventory
By deﬁnition, lean manufacturing is an operating philosophy that focuses
on minimizing the amount of resources required by eliminating all non-
value-added activities in the supply chain. Here at Woodstock, we have
a lot of waste. Can any of you think of something we do almost daily
that is wasteful and doesn’t add value to our products or services? I bet
each of you can come up with ten things we do that are wasteful, and
everyone’s list will be different!
I’ve heard that Michael spent considerable time discussing some of the
process-ﬂow improvements that are under way. He spoke about estab-
lishing U-shaped work cells, value stream mapping, takt time, and mistake-
prooﬁng processes. This is all part of our lean manufacturing initiatives;
but getting lean is much more than that. It is a process of continuous,
never-ending improvement. It has to become part of our company culture
just like our inventory rightsizing effort. In fact, you really can’t get the
job done without some implementation of the lean concepts. We have a
lot of waste here at Woodstock, and inventory is a big part of it. Consider
these wastes and the impact on inventory:

Rightsizing Inventory
Waste and Inventory
Defective parts: Making defective parts causes multiple inventory issues.
If the defective part can’t be reworked, it will have to be scrapped or
sold as second quality. In effect, we will lose money on it. We have to
use more raw materials to make the new part. If we don’t have the raw
material, we may have to pay a premium for it and might even have to
pay a premium freight charge to expedite it. Having to make it again
will require additional machine time and labor, which will add to the
cost of the product and erode the proﬁt margin. Using a machine to
make the part again will also reduce our capacity. However, catching a
defect before it goes out the door is a good thing, because the customer
didn’t receive it; otherwise, the cost of a defective part could be much
higher — a lost customer.
TIP #93: Producing defective parts will create multiple
inventory problems, add to your cost, reduce proﬁtabil-
ity, and reduce capacity. Design processes to ensure
perfect quality.
1.
Wait time: If a material is sitting in the storeroom or sitting in
queue at a work center, it has the potential to become waste. If
it sits too long without being used, it could become obsolete,
damaged, or lost. If a machine operator has to wait for work, this
too is wasteful. Conceptually, inventory should ﬂow through our
plant in a continuous ﬂow, like water through a pipe. As material
sits in queue to be worked on, WIP inventory will more than likely
increase. This is one of our problems here at Woodstock. We have
far too much WIP inventory waiting to be worked on.
TIP #94: Balance workﬂows and production resources as
much as possible so that wait time is kept to a minimum.
2.
Moving material: Any time we are moving material and not
adding value to it, we are adding cost to it. You all know the
problem we have with our antiquated plant layout and the issues
we face with building #1 (the old three-story building). This puts
us at a cost disadvantage. If we didn’t have so many non-value-
added “touches,” we would be proﬁtable; I’m convinced of it.
TIP #95: Any time the product is touched without value
being added is adding cost. All non-value-added touches
are candidates for elimination.

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

273
3.
Inventory itself: Any inventory not needed to satisfy an immediate
customer need is waste. High levels of safety stock are used to
cover the uncertainty of supply and demand. We absolutely need
to get a handle on it. Excess inventory is even worse. It is the
inventory we have above and beyond established safety-stock
levels. It’s one thing to have safety stock, but to have inventory
in excess of that is almost criminal!
TIP #96: Inventory not needed to satisfy an immediate
customer requirement is considered wasteful and reduced
or eliminated when possible.
4.
Company politics and company culture: What do politics and
culture have to do with waste and inventory? I’ll tell you. Our
company environment is such that employees are afraid of getting
yelled at, getting a bad performance review, looking bad to their
peers (and bosses) and, in general, of losing their jobs. Everyone
knows we are in trouble ﬁnancially and doesn’t want to be the
one to go, at least not on the company terms. I bet that at least
50 percent of our employees are looking for other jobs — and
doing a lot of the leg work on company time. The result of all
this insecurity is that people protect themselves by having extra
inventory in their area of the supply chain. “If I think I need two,
I’ll order four, just to be on the safe side.” If everyone thinks that
way, each silo will probably have two to three times the amount
of inventory they really need. This affects employee morale, and
we all know what happens when morale is bad. We become
unproductive and waste even more time complaining about it
than working.
TIP #97: Company politics is a complete waste of time
and energy. Change the company culture and eliminate
politics.
5.
Inaccurate and untimely information: This is one of the
biggest wastes of all. We spend far too much time correcting
inaccurate information. Not only does it waste time, but it causes
our inventory to become out of balance. The other waste is
untimely information. It takes us too long to get information from
link to link in our supply chain. In today’s environment of rapid
response to changing customer needs, we cannot afford the
luxury of waiting for information.

274

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #98: To be successful in your inventory rightsizing
efforts, information must be accurate and timely.
6.
Waste of talent: I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen Joe
walking around the plant looking for a part that was supposed to
be in stock. I have personally seen him do this for hours at a time!
Do you know what this adds to the cost, to say nothing about his
unproductive time? Many managers at Woodstock do this. We have
stock clerks who are responsible for this. If they aren’t doing their
job right, then I suggest we explain what their responsibilities are
and give them proper training on how to do their job effectively.
TIP #99: Working outside your job description is admi-
rable and shows teamwork, but it can be costly and
wasteful. Delegate authority, and train employees to do
their job.
7.
Complexity: I know the Harmony Team is looking at many areas
of our supply chain, and I see that from time to time you publish
new operating polices and procedures. I caution you to not make
them too complex, because people will have difﬁculty understand-
ing and executing them. If you do, this will cause more problems
than it solves, and people will waste a lot of time that could be
put to better use. A focus of our inventory rightsizing effort should
be to keep processes and procedures as simple, easy to understand,
and easy to use as possible.
TIP #100: Complexity may cause problems and hinder
your inventory rightsizing efforts rather than help them.
You will need a plan for a lean implementation effort. You can’t leave
it to chance. Remember, you are looking to reduce waste. That waste can
be in a product, process, or service you provide. You want to start in an
area where you believe you can achieve success in a relatively short
period of time. The success doesn’t have to be large. Many small successes
will be as rewarding as one large success. If you are on a lean imple-
mentation team for six months and still haven’t achieved good results,
you have picked the wrong place to start.
Not to be cynical, we could have started anywhere at Woodstock and
achieved satisfactory results. That’s how big our opportunity is. We have
started on the factory ﬂoor because we have determined that is where
the big savings will come from. You don’t have to focus on one area
exclusively. You can have multiple lean initiatives going on at the same

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

275
time, but you must be careful not to cause chaos on the factory ﬂoor.
Remember, you still have to produce and ship products out the door.
TIP #101: Begin your lean initiative in an area of your
supply chain where opportunities for improvement are
signiﬁcant. For most manufacturing companies, this is
usually the factory ﬂoor.
This is the approach we are using:
1.
Select an area to start: We have chosen the assembly W/C #401
and the machine shop W/C #301.
2.
Select team members and a team leader: There will be two teams,
one assigned to each work center. The makeup of the teams is a mix
of personnel from manufacturing, distribution, and administration.
3.
Conduct education on: what we are going to do, why we are doing
it, and how we are going to do it (tools used).
4.
Develop a schedule of when you are going to do it (start time and
date, end time and date).
5.
Take pictures and develop process ﬂow maps on how product
ﬂows through the work center.
6.
Establish timelines for each activity, including the wait (queue)
time between operations.
7.
When appropriate, measure the distances that products/resources
move between each process step.
8.
Benchmark the current performance in the work center (units of
output, unit throughput).
9.
Establish a criterion for the work center. For example, how much
WIP should be in the work center: one hour of WIP or one day
of WIP?
10.
Conduct a good housekeeping campaign. Remove everything from
the work center that isn’t needed. For example, tables, benches,
tools, inventory, empty cartons, etc…
11.
Identify non-value-added activities in the work center.
12.
Conduct brainstorming sessions to come up with ideas on how to
eliminate the non-value-added activities, and improve the process
so that there is a continuous ﬂow into and out of the work center.
13.
Convert work centers to the new ﬂow.
14.
Measure results of the new ﬂow.
15.
If satisfactory, look to improve the value-added steps in the process.
16.
When you believe that the lean initiative in that area has been
achieved (it’s never over) for now, take pictures, publish results
(storyboard, newsletter), and recognize the team for a job well done.

This is the process we followed for W/C #401 (spotlight assembly).

Figure 7.6 shows the work center as it is today after the lean initiative.
We still have a ways to go, but notice the progress we already made. We
have gone from 22 work locations down to 12. We have eliminated all
the tables that were holding WIP. Because we reduced WIP, we needed
less space, and we also decided to replace the permanent storage tables
with mobile carts, eliminating the need for several touches that don’t add
value to the product. A big space savings was eliminating the kitting
operation (tables 20 and 21). We decided to eliminate kitting on jobs
where all the parts were not available.
Tables 16 and 17 were eliminated because they held hard copies of
the job description documentation. Because all the documentation was
on the computer (table 15), there was no longer a need for the hard
copies. Table 18 was the primary WIP inventory storage area. We elimi-
nated this and put in mobile carts that could move about the work center.
Each cart holds one job, and anyone walking into the work center can
quickly see what the workload is in this work center. When we started
the initiative, this work center had 5 days of WIP inventory, consisting of
63 jobs (work orders). On average, it could complete 10 jobs a day, so
this represented 6.3 days of WIP. What is the point of sending in more
jobs? They would only sit in queue. There are now only 30 jobs in the
work center, about 3 days’ worth of work. Our short-term goal is to get
it down to 10 jobs (1 day of WIP) and take it from there. We aren’t
ﬁnished yet, but you can see we have made good progress.
The “good housekeeping” approach was great. We discovered a lot of
stuff that had no business being in the work center. We also found a
completely ﬁnished job under one table. One of the assemblers com-
mented that just last week they had to expedite a work order for that

Rightsizing Inventory
very same job! Here they were, working hard and fast on the top of the
workbench when there was a perfectly good ﬁnished part under the
workbench not two feet away! Crazy, right? I bet this happens more often
than we care to admit.
We are in the process of installing Andon Warning Lights in the
pressroom, machine shop, and engineering, so that if assembly (second
ﬂoor, building 1) detects a quality problem, it can signal production (ﬁrst
ﬂoor) and engineering (third ﬂoor) to stop sending parts and to focus on
ﬁnding the root cause of the quality problem.
The primary tools used in work center #401 are screwdrivers, pliers,
rubber mallets, wire cutters, and sheet metal cutters. Each operator keeps
his own set of tools in a tool box under his work bench and locks it up
at the end of the work day. Problems occur when he is not at work the
next day. We can move cross-trained workers in from another work
center, but they have to borrow tools from other operators because they
don’t have access to the primary operator’s tool box. At times, either
borrower or lender is waiting for the other to ﬁnish with the tool they
are using. We are going to consolidate all tools into one tool cabinet. At
the end of each shift, all tools will be put away and accounted for. The
supervisor will have the primary key, and a spare key will be kept by
me and Arnie.
TIP #103: When beginning your lean initiative, don’t focus
on eliminating inventory; focus on eliminating waste. A
major beneﬁt of eliminating waste will be the rightsizing
of your inventory.
Pull Systems and Inventory
One technique that will help us rightsize our inventory is to move from
a “push philosophy” to a “pull philosophy” on the factory ﬂoor. I once
worked for a company where the materials manager operated under the
philosophy that when she left the ofﬁce at the end of the day, she wanted
a clean desk without any open “to-do” for the next work day. She was
constantly releasing orders early and sending them to manufacturing
without any regard for whether the plant could meet the delivery dates.
Needless to say, this concept of pushing work orders without regard to
production schedules caused havoc on the factory ﬂoor. It got so bad that
when a customer called to check on the status of an order, we had to
track it down on the factory ﬂoor. We spent just as much time looking
for a copy of the order as we did looking for missing parts (not a good
thing either).

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

At Woodstock, our ﬂashlight manufacturing is currently based on a
push system from manufacturing to assembly. It’s somewhat easier to
control the spotlight and beacon light products because they are typically
make-to-order and assemble-to-order. Because the ﬂashlights are make-
to-stock and the volumes are high, there is a tendency to push products
downstream to another work center, whether they need the work or not.
As you know, we mold the tops and barrels for our basic ﬂashlights. We
outsource the bulb assembly and kit the hardware (springs, contacts, and
switches). The battery inventory is on the assembly work center ﬂoor and
is the only item that is pulled into the work center based on a two-bin
system. Figure 7.7 illustrates the two-bin system used for batteries.
A carton of batteries is on the factory ﬂoor. When the carton is empty,
it is removed and replaced with a full carton from the storeroom. When
the storeroom issues the carton to the factory ﬂoor, that is a signal for
the warehouse to order another carton from the supplier. Of course, I am
oversimplifying. There is more than one carton on the factory ﬂoor and
more than one carton in the storeroom. But whether it is one or ten, the
philosophy is the same.
All four of these components (top, bottom, bulb assembly, and hard-
ware kit) come together in the assembly shop and are assembled by hand.
Some day, when we can afford it, we need to automate this assembly
process. If we can’t, then we need to consider moving it offshore or
outsourcing it. It’s just getting too expensive to continue doing it in house
much longer.
In an ideal manufacturing environment, all four major components
would arrive at the assembly work center at the same time. Unfortunately
this doesn’t happen. We usually have too much of one part and a shortage

Rightsizing Inventory
of another part. It is rare to have the same quantity of all four components.
It is hard for us to rightsize our inventory when we have this kind of
imbalance going on in the plant.
TIP #104: Moving from a push manufacturing philosophy
to a pull manufacturing philosophy will greatly beneﬁt
your inventory rightsizing efforts.
To convert to a pull system from a push system, we need to start as
far downstream in our supply chain as possible. Let’s focus on the ﬂashlight
division because that represents our largest inventory investment and
therefore becomes the best opportunity for aggregate inventory reduction.
The furthest downstream point for this product line is our points of
distribution to the customers, our distribution centers (D/Cs). Ideally, some
day we can go further downstream to our customers, who are the actual
distributors to the retail customers. We tried to implement a pull system
with the D/Cs a few years ago, but it didn’t work out very well. We
advised them of our replenishment lead time, but they abused it. I think
our sales team had a lot to do with it by pressuring them to ship their
orders at the expense of other salespeople.
I believe it really failed for a different reason. We have three D/Cs
located in California, Texas, and Florida. Each center operated autono-
mously and pretty much ordered what it wanted without regard for what
the other centers needed or what the production schedule was at the
plant. On some of the more popular products they would hoard inventory,
even if they knew another D/C had a shortage. Management had to step
in and force them to ship some of their safety stock to other D/Cs. It was
absolutely chaotic.
Do you know we hired a consultant to look at this movement of goods
between the D/Cs? The study showed one case where we moved ﬁnished
goods from California to Florida, and a month later Florida sent the same
goods back to California! I consider this a non-value-added activity. It
adds to our transportation cost at a time when we are trying to reduce
operating costs. The consultant estimated that we were spending over
$100,000 a year in transportation costs moving goods between the D/Cs.
Since then, we have gone back to pushing products to the D/Cs based
on the sales forecast for that region of the country. Off the record, I’ve
heard rumors that we are going to shut the D/Cs down and ship directly
from the plant. If it’s true, I don’t know where we are going to get the
space. You all know the issue we have with space. Of course, if we didn’t
have so much inventory, we would probably have some extra room, but
not enough to handle the current inventory at all three D/Cs. When you

talk to Carlos in distribution, ask him. Maybe he knows if the rumors are
true or not.
TIP #105: If multiple locations are pulling products from
the same source of production, inventory movement must
be coordinated and carefully planned for.
For now we have decided to look at implementing a pull system in
our manufacturing plant and put off the pull system at the D/Cs. In
manufacturing, the problem with our push system is that it is based on
schedules developed for each production and assembly work center. The
minute the schedule gets disrupted, and this happens a lot, it gets out of
whack, and we have late work orders. Due dates quickly lose meaning
and planning has to regenerate a whole new schedule. Here is a real
problem: We don’t change the due dates on the late orders. After a while
we have a backlog of orders, which backs up WIP inventory and creates
a situation where we have inventory all over the place.
Last week manufacturing actually had to move WIP inventory up to
the second ﬂoor because it ran out of room in the machine shop. On top
of all this, new orders were released to the machine shop, which only
compounded the problem. That’s why, when we run MRP we get a slew
of action notices that it is almost impossible to deal with. By deﬁnition,
a pull system at Woodstock will be a visual signaling system where
downstream work centers pull products from upstream work centers as
needed. We are going to start by having spotlight assembly (W/C #401)
pull products from the pressroom (W/C #201) and the pressroom will pull
products from the machine shop (W/C #301). There are times when the
machine shop is pulling products from the pressroom also. Figure 7.8
depicts the pull system concept.
The pull starts at the furthest point downstream, which, in this case,
is the spotlight assembly (W/C #401). At the beginning of the shift, the

Rightsizing Inventory
bulb assemblies needed for that day will be pulled from the storeroom
and staged in the W/C storage area. We are going to use a mixed lot
schedule and make a lot size of 25 of each color lens in the following
sequence: red, blue, and white. They can assemble 75 lights per hour (25
of each color). The spotlight frame comes from the pressroom (W/C #201)
in multiple shapes, but in our example we are going to use part #81074.
The assembly W/C #401 will pull 75 frames from W/C #201 at the
beginning of the shift. Because the W/Cs are on separate ﬂoors, they will
send a visual signal to the pressroom to send 75 frames.
We have decided (for now) to use lights as the signal between work
centers. A light board will be installed in the pressroom, and each assembly
area will have a different light code. For spotlights, the color used will
be amber. Pressroom staff will have 75 lens frames made and sitting in
storage in the work center (not the stockroom). When they see the amber
light, they will move the 75 lens frames to the assembly work center.
Once the 75 pieces are moved and the storage spot designated for the
frames is empty, that is the signal for the pressroom to make 75 more
lens frames and place them in the assigned storage space. The pressroom
will not make any more of that frame until the 75 already made have
been pulled by the assembly work center.
In the next phase of implementation, we will pull the components for
that frame from the machine shop. The big advantage of this pull concept
is that WIP for this part will never exceed 75 pieces, and the pressroom
is only producing what will be needed to meet that immediate requirement.
If we can get this to work well, we will reduce the lot size of the pull
and continue to do so until the lot size is as small as reasonable. The
concept is to have a lot size of one pulled when needed. I don’t see us
getting down to that small a lot size. Just controlling lot sizes of 75 pieces
will be a big accomplishment for us.
TIP #106: When implementing a pull system, gradually
reduce the lot-size quantity until you have achieved the
smallest possible lot size. The ideal goal would be to
produce a lot size of one.
The primary advantages of moving to a pull system are the following:
1.
Producing exactly what is needed to satisfy an immediate customer
need (internal and external)
2.
Eliminating as much paperwork as possible by using signals instead
3.
Moving product only as needed — not before
4.
Controlling the amount of WIP inventory
5.
Gradually reducing the amount of WIP inventory

6.
Reducing total product throughput time
7.
Coordinating the movement of product through the supply chain
Because the lot size is predetermined, a standard size container can
be used, eliminating the need to count the parts in the work center. Each
container will hold the same quantity of parts. As you can see, the rewards
of doing this successfully are signiﬁcant. But there are risks. If the
fabrication press breaks down, the assembly work staff may have to stop
working as well after they ﬁnish the 75 parts in the work center. Because
of this risk, Joe wants us to keep 8 lots (600 frames) in the storeroom
to cover one day’s production in the assembly work center (75 per hour;
75 × 8 = 600). This defeats the whole purpose of the pull concept. If
he’s worried about the press breaking down, he should focus on the
maintenance of the press to keep it in good working condition. The
maintenance crew can discuss this with you in more detail. For now, we
have our hands full trying to convince Joe that safety stock isn’t the
answer to this problem.
Implementing a pull system in assembly and the pressroom will be
relatively easy compared to the machine shop because they perform
repetitive processes, which adapt well to a pull system. Products made
once a year, like the new lantern product, will not be a good candidate
for a pull system. Because assembly will be working on a repetitive
schedule, no work orders will be issued to the ﬂoor. We are also going
to install a takt time board to monitor the assembly work center output.
Storeroom Inventory Management
By way of deﬁnition, our storeroom is where we store raw materials,
subassemblies, components, factory supplies, spare parts for maintenance,
and ofﬁce supplies. We try not to use it for ﬁnished goods. As you already
know, the storeroom is in building 2, which is adjacent to our manufac-
turing plant. Every time we need something from the storeroom, we send
a forklift driver over to get it. The building is only 100 feet away, but in
inclement weather this becomes a problem. Every couple of years Joe
talks about knocking down walls and attaching the two buildings, but it
has never happened. There never seems to be any money in the budget
for it. It becomes a particular waste of time when we have to move
something from the storeroom to the assembly area, which is on the
second ﬂoor of building 1. That’s one of the reasons I support the pull
system we are going to install in the spotlight assembly work center.
Goods will go directly from manufacturing to the work center without
having to be stored in the storeroom.

284

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #107: The storeroom is a good place to start your
inventory rightsizing efforts. Inventory accuracy begins
with the receipt of inventory into the storeroom.
As we continue to reorganize the plant, we will look more and more
at storing materials at the point of manufacture (in the work center needing
it) or point of use (near the work center where it will be used). Once
we get the WIP inventory down to a manageable size, we want to start
doing this in the machine shop and press room.
Inventory is stored in the storeroom using two different stocking
methodologies:
Fixed Storage Locations (Preassigned)
Storage locations are preassigned to part numbers and, when goods are
received, they are put away into their assigned location. When the goods
are picked, a “pick list” is generated with the location number where the
goods are stored. Depending on the size, shape, density, and weight, we
can control where the parts are stored. For example, heavy items like the
rolls of sheet metal used for fabrication are stored on the ﬂoor, and
lightweight items like the ﬂashlight caps are stored on the higher shelves
in the warehouse. Items that turn over frequently are stored near the
staging area, and slow-turning items are stored at the farthest point from
the staging area.
There are obvious beneﬁts to using a ﬁxed location system. It becomes
more efﬁcient for the stock pickers because they will quickly become
familiar with where the parts are stored, and they won’t have far to travel
for the high-turnover parts as they are stored near the staging area.
However, there are disadvantages. We frequently have more material to
store than the assigned location will hold, so we have to go to an overﬂow
location that, in most cases, is not close by and therefore more inefﬁcient.
Overall, the storing and picking activities are more efﬁcient, but the
aggregate space utilization is less efﬁcient. We try to use a ﬁxed location
for fast-moving items and items of considerable weight.
Random Storage Locations
A random location method does not preassign locations to part numbers.
With this method, as goods are received they are put away according to
a predetermined criterion like size, weight, or quantity. Our computer
system can take the shipment data and assign a location according to the
criteria. The forklift operator then puts the goods in that location. In those

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

285
cases where the computer doesn’t have the capability to assign a location,
the forklift operator will ﬁnd the ﬁrst suitable, available location, indicate
the location on the paperwork, and advise the warehouse system where
the goods are stored. When this happens, it sometimes causes us problems.
If the forklift driver doesn’t write down the location clearly, it might
get entered into the system incorrectly. For example, misinterpreting a 7
to be a 9, or a 3 to be a 5, may cause us hours of wasted time because
the part wasn’t where we thought it was. The beneﬁt of using the random
location method is typically a more efﬁcient use of total storeroom space.
The disadvantages are that part storage and picking may be less efﬁcient,
and it can cause the misinterpretation of part numbers I spoke about
earlier.
Zoned Storage Inventory Locations
Fixed- and random-storage location systems focus on where the items are
put in our storeroom. Zoned-storage location focuses on where we put
personnel in the storeroom. We divided our storeroom up into three zones.
Zone 1 is for ﬂashlight inventory, zone 2 is for spotlight inventory, and
zone 3 is for beacon light inventory. Zone 1 is our largest zone, and four
stock handlers are assigned there. Zone 2 is half the size of zone 1, and
zone 3 is about the size of my den at home (about 450 square feet). Two
stock handlers cover zone 2 and 3 together.
Within a zone we use both random and ﬁxed locations. The advantage
of splitting our storeroom up into zones is that the personnel working in
that zone really get to know their area well, and they have responsibility
for their assigned zone only.
The Storeroom and Inventory Management
Following good warehousing concepts and procedures will greatly
enhance our opportunity to improve our inventory rightsizing efforts. We
have always had an “open door policy” in the warehouse. What that
means is, any time someone needs materials, they can just go in and take
what they need. And I do mean anyone. I have just discovered that
Michael from our product design team took some preassembled light
frames out of inventory to conduct destructive testing. Cyndie is furious.
She needed these parts to complete a light assembly for a new customer.
It will take two weeks to replace the raw materials and another week to
manufacture and assemble. We promised customers we would ship it in
one week. Now someone has to tell them we don’t have the subassemblies
and we will be two weeks late. I feel sorry for the sales representative

286

Rightsizing Inventory
who has to tell them. That needs to stop right now. We are going to
implement a storage control procedure.
Yesterday we implemented an authorization control procedure where
no one is allowed to enter the storeroom without the approval of the
storeroom manager. I realize this is a bit harsh, but Joe is trying to take
a stand on this. He is actually having signs made up that say, “Do Not
Enter, Authorized Personnel Only” — do you believe it? He actually expects
the requester to ring a bell and wait for someone to come and let him
in. After he shows his request form, he will be allowed to take the goods.
I have never heard of anything so silly. We are not dealing with controlled
substances or high-value precious gems.
The company I used to work for had the inventory in what we called
a locked storeroom. The room was literally locked up, and we had a
counter behind a caged window where you went with your authorization
form to take goods out of the room. The stock clerks would pick the
goods and deliver them to the work center that authorized the movement.
That is what we should do here. Our computer system is sophisticated
enough to generate the pick list on the screen, and the storeroom can
just print it out and deliver the goods to the required work center. There
is no need for someone from the work center to waste time coming to
the storeroom for the goods. I support the locked storeroom concept, but
not to the extreme that Joe wants to go. A locked storeroom will protect
against pilferage and help us maintain integrity of the inventory records
— a big problem for us at Woodstock. We are going to ask Joe to modify
the procedure as I have suggested today.
TIP #108: Establishing an authorized control procedure for
goods moving into and out of the storeroom will greatly
improve your opportunity to rightsize your inventory.
I believe I covered the major points I wanted to share with you today.
Michael told you about all the good things we have planned for product
and process design. Those activities, along with what I have shared with
you today, will greatly enhance our efforts to rightsize our inventory.
Thank you for listening.

Inter-Ofﬁce E-Mail
To: Supply-Chain Managers
May 29
From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory: $38.1 Million: Down $1.9 Million
since the ﬁrst of the year.
This e-mail represents a summary of the meeting we
had with Orlando about the activities going on in man-
ufacturing. You will also note from Table 7.3 that actual
customer orders were greater than forecasted. This
helped reduce ﬁnished goods inventory. While WIP
remained relatively unchanged, we did reduce raw
material inventory, thanks to purchasing ordering less
raw material because of the changes in purchasing lead
time, and the fact that our summer interns have iden-
tiﬁed some raw material that were substituted for the
original part number. This shows that the things we are
doing are starting to pay dividends. We expect this
downward trend to continue for the rest of the year.
Product and process design are now working concur-
rently on all new products, have begun to look at our
most popular products, and are aggressively looking to
redesign the products and processes to reduce costs
and enhance our value-added activities. The following
are the highlights of our meeting. The minutes of the
meeting will be published tomorrow, and we ask that
you share them with your team:
1.
Manufacturing is actively looking for ways to reduce
the amount of raw material and WIP inventory in our
supply chain.
2.
The primary responsibility of manufacturing is to
produce quality products and meet the require-
ments of our MPS and FAS.
3.
Manufacturing is also responsible for the effective uti-
lization of resources, balancing supply and demand,
and managing storeroom and WIP inventory.
4.
We will use three different planning zones for our
MPS and FAS. Different levels of authorization are

288

Rightsizing Inventory
required in each zone. The purpose is to control the
number of changes in the execution of our produc-
tion plans. A policy will be published shortly.
5.
We learned that there is a direct relationship between
lead time and WIP inventory levels.
6.
A load proﬁle report showing a comparison of work-
load and capacity for each work center will be devel-
oped and distributed on a monthly basis.
7.
We have learned how to adjust our total available
capacity (resources: machines and personnel) for uti-
lization and efﬁciency, and we will report the actual
performance to planned performance.
8.
Workload is calculated based on the remaining work
to be done on released orders and orders that are
planned to be released in the future.
9.
The load proﬁle report will not work effectively if lead
times, routing, and work center data are inaccurate.
(To that end, please look at the current data and
advise us if you note any discrepancies.)
10.
We have embarked on a lean manufacturing initiative.
Lean manufacturing is a philosophy of eliminating
waste in our supply chain. Waste has been deﬁned as
anything that doesn’t add value to our product or
services. (Please review your processes and let us
know where you believe we have an abundance of
waste that can be eliminated.)
11.
We will provide education on the lean initiative to all
employees. This education will include what a lean
initiative is, why we are doing it, and how to do it.
12.
A major good housekeeping policy is being imple-
mented in each work center.
13.
Major areas of waste have been identiﬁed, and we are
seeking to reduce/eliminate the waste.
14.
Our company will change from using a push-system
philosophy to a pull-system philosophy throughout
our entire supply chain. We are starting on the factory
ﬂoor (work centers), and eventually we will move the
pull system further downstream in our supply chain.
15.
As much as reasonably possible, we will replace paper
as a form of communicating product movement
through the plant. Visual signals will be the primary
vehicle to move product through our supply chain.

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

289
We have begun by installing Andon Warning Lights
in some work centers.
16.
There will be limited access to the storeroom inven-
tory. We are implementing a locked storeroom con-
cept so that inventory moving into and out of the
storeroom can be controlled more effectively.
17.
The storeroom will be divided into zones. Inventory
clerks will be assigned to each zone, and they will be
responsible for the inventory in their zones.
Attached to this e-mail is Figure 7.9, which is the latest
version of our inventory rightsizing model. As always,
we welcome your comments and suggestions. Our next
meeting will be on July 2, when Carlos will discuss the
activities of our distribution and transportation links.

Rightsizing Inventory
Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
In this chapter, we covered the manufacturing supply-chain link and added
21 more TIPS on how to rightsize your inventory. In this section we will
review each of the TIPS and discuss how they can be applied to your
company. Before we begin, I want to emphasize how important a lean
initiative can be to your inventory rightsizing efforts. I believe it is an
important concept for companies to focus on as they try to reduce and
shift the inventory in their supply chain. I cannot think of a more important
philosophy to apply. Lean is all about eliminating waste. If you can reduce
or eliminate the waste taking place in your company, your chances of
continued success will be greatly improved. Those companies that cannot
eliminate waste will have a hard time surviving in today’s competitive
global environment.
Tip #88: In a job shop manufacturing environment, the
bottleneck operation is not stationary. It is constantly
shifting from work center to work center and will create
an imbalance of your WIP inventory.
A bottleneck operation is one of the biggest challenges you must
overcome to achieve a continuous ﬂow in your plant.
1.
Focus on eliminating the bottleneck. Once you do that, you will
ﬁnd another bottleneck somewhere else. Focus on eliminating that
bottleneck. Continue this process until all bottlenecks have been
eliminated.
2.
Cross-train personnel so that additional resources can be added to
the bottleneck operation until it is in line with the other operations.
Then move the personnel on to the next bottleneck operation. In
other words, move your resources around your plant as needed
to relieve the bottleneck.
3.
In some cases, you might be able to move machinery around your
plant to address a bottleneck operation. Remember the example I
cited earlier with the sewing machines on wheels in Chapter 6.
4.
Until you can eliminate the bottleneck, all upstream and down-
stream operations from the bottleneck must be synchronized with
the output of the bottleneck work center.
5.
Conceptually, you never want to run out of work for the bottleneck
work center. The worst thing you can do is have the bottleneck
work center waiting for work. Until you resolve the bottleneck

issue, keep some buffer inventory in queue in front of the bottle-
neck work center.
TIP #89: If supply (capacity) and demand (workload) are
not in balance, the change in inventory will negatively
impact your inventory rightsizing efforts.
You cannot balance supply and demand without ﬁrst knowing what
the supply and demand is for any given period of time:
1.
Create a load proﬁle report similar to the one shown in this chapter.
2.
The load proﬁle data must be accurate, otherwise you are wasting
valuable time.
3.
The report should go as far out into the future (planning horizon)
as necessary to make adjustments to the plan to bring it back into
alignment.
4.
Before reacting to an overloaded condition, make sure you under-
stand the nature of the workload (is it forecast or real orders) and
the capacity.
5.
Before rescheduling work to another period where capacity is
available, make sure you have done everything reasonable to meet
the demand. The last thing you want to do is change the order
date, especially if it is a customer order.
6.
If an out of balance (overload) continues to exist for a long period
of time, you may have to consider getting permanent additional
capacity (outsourcing or getting new equipment). However, before
doing so, look at the long-term company plans (strategy, S&OP,
CRM, etc.).
7.
If an out of balance (underload) continues to exist for a long period
of time, you may have to retrain workers and place them in other
positions in the supply chain where overload conditions exist. If
it is equipment related, you might want to consider keeping the
equipment idle if not needed. Why make products you don’t need?
TIP #90: Calculate capacity based on your normal work
week. If you normally operate ﬁve days a week, then
calculate your capacity based on ﬁve days. If you always
operate seven days a week, then you can calculate your
capacity based on seven days.
Only develop material and capacity plans based on your normal work
week and your manufacturing calendar. Saturdays and daily overtime
should only be used to catch up or work on a priority order and should

292

Rightsizing Inventory
never be counted on as part of your normal work week. If you consistently
are working overtime (every Saturday and daily), you might want to
consider adding a second shift (or third). The cost of additional personnel
might be offset by not having to pay time and a half or double time. My
experience has been that over sustained periods of continuous overtime,
productivity decreases, quality decreases, and worker fatigue can cause
potential safety issues.
TIP #91: Make sure your shop calendar is adjusted each
year to account for nonwork days. Failure to do so will
hinder your inventory rightsizing efforts.
If you mistakenly identify a nonwork day as a work day, your computer
system (MRP) will generate recommendations for orders to be released
that day and, when they are not, the next time you run MRP you will
probably get an expedite message. If this misidentiﬁcation of work versus
nonwork days continues, you will create confusion as to what the real
priorities are on the factory ﬂoor. Discuss the future shop calendar dates
with your human resources link and your ﬁnance link. Typically, they
will know years in advance what the company calendar looks like. One
more important point I want to make here. If you plan for a complete
plant shutdown for one to two weeks (vacation or holiday), make sure
your customers are advised and are in agreement with the dates.
TIP #92: Develop a load proﬁle report by work center.
Distribute it to all appropriate links in the supply chain
so that each upstream and downstream link can use it as
a tool to make decisions that impact inventory levels in
the entire supply chain.
I discussed the load proﬁle report in tip #89. However, I do want
to stress here that the report should be communicated to all supply-
chain links. As I discussed in this chapter, even human resources can
use this report to develop education plans. Although manufacturing will
gain the greatest beneﬁt from this report, other links (upstream and
downstream) will also gain from seeing it. A load proﬁle report should
be reviewed and updated at least once a month, or more often if
conditions warrant it.
TIP #93: Producing defective parts will create multiple
inventory problems, add to your cost, reduce proﬁtability,
and reduce capacity. Design processes to ensure perfect
quality.

Steps taken here should include the following:
1.
Use a concurrent engineering strategy from the very beginning on
new parts and products.
2.
Reverse-engineer existing parts to see if parts can be eliminated
or standardized.
3.
Train operators on how to properly maintain their equipment and
machines (routine maintenance).
4.
Train operators on how to properly operate the equip-
ment/machines.
5.
Train operators on how to inspect their own work for defects.
6.
Empower operators to stop production when defects are detected.
Do not pass defective parts on to the next downstream operation.
TIP #94: Balance workﬂows and production resources as
much as possible so that wait time is kept to a minimum.
Wait time is a non-value-added activity that can be deﬁned as the time
a job is waiting to be moved to the next step. It could be waiting to be
moved to another operation, work center, warehouse, or the shipping
dock (if completed). I will deﬁne wait time in a broader sense. It can
also be the time the job is sitting in queue, waiting to be worked on.
Regardless of which deﬁnition you use, wait time should be kept to a
minimum or eliminated completely. You can eliminate or reduce wait time
by designing your processes so that products ﬂow continuously. Reducing
throughput time and lot size will minimize the amount of time a job will
wait in queue. Reducing wait time will also help you reduce the amount
of WIP inventory on the factory ﬂoor.
1.
Try moving additional resources into a work center that has unac-
ceptable wait time.
2.
Reduce lot sizes.
3.
Rebalance workloads at the upstream and downstream work centers.
TIP #95: Any time the product is touched without value
being added is adding cost. All non-value-added touches
are candidates for elimination.
Not every product touch can be eliminated, but the total number of
touches can be decreased:
1.
Create process ﬂow maps of how the product ﬂows through a
process.

294

Rightsizing Inventory
2.
Count the number of times the product is touched.
3.
Identify the number of non-value-added touches.
4.
Brainstorm for ideas/ways to eliminate those non-value-added
touches.
5.
Eliminate those non-value-added touches.
TIP #96: Inventory not needed to satisfy an immediate
customer requirement is considered wasteful and reduced
or eliminated when possible.
This begs the question of why we are making more than we need to
satisfy an immediate customer requirement. There are many reasons for
you to do this. One of the reasons popularly given is that the customer
order delivery time required is less than the time it takes us to make;
therefore, we have to make it in advance and put it into inventory. Those
of you with this environment need to focus on reducing your manufac-
turing time as much as possible. As you reduce your manufacturing lead
time, you also reduce your safety stock (buffer stock) proportionally.
Companies that have a make-to-stock strategy will ﬁnd this most
challenging:
1.
Look at your items and identify where you have excess inventory.
2.
Try to reduce the lot size on your next order (make/buy).
3.
Reduce your purchase or manufacture lead time.
4.
Reduce safety stock levels gradually.
5.
Keep your eye on customer service levels.
6.
If customer service is not negatively affected, reduce your safety
stock further.
TIP #97: Company politics is a complete waste of time
and energy. Change the company culture and eliminate
politics.
I’m no expert on the human mind, but I do know this: As long as
you need people to run your business, you will have some amount of
politics in the company. I have never seen politics completely eliminated
even in well-known world-class companies. What I do know is that
spending time talking about your coworkers, having hidden motives
(personal agendas) at meetings, and not telling your boss the complete
truth about a certain situation are all a waste of time. They do not add
value to your company and, in fact, they are harmful. Eliminating com-
pany politics and changing a company culture has to start at the top.
Management must recognize the need for change and set a good example

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

for all employees to follow. You can do ﬁve things to help change the
company culture:
1.
Keep employees informed on the current condition of the com-
pany.
2.
Stop rumors and half-truths from circulating.
3.
Treat everyone with respect.
4.
Provide education and training to improve employee skill sets and
morals.
5.
Get all employees involved in your inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #98: To be successful in your inventory rightsizing
efforts, information must be accurate and timely.
In Chapter 5, I introduced the concept of the “BILL of Integrity.” I
believe it is worth mentioning again. The four areas of data accuracy that
I have identiﬁed as important to your inventory rightsizing efforts are:
1.
Bill of material accuracy
2.
Inventory accuracy
3.
Lead time accuracy
4.
Lot-size rules
If the integrity of data in these four areas is accurate, then you have
greatly improved your chances of rightsizing your inventory.
TIP #99: Working outside your job description is admira-
ble and shows teamwork, but it can be costly and wasteful.
Delegate authority, and train employees to do their job.
Having the vice president (VP) of operations walking around the
stockroom looking for parts (as Joe did) is not a good use of his time,
and it sends a bad message to the employees whose job it is to store and
pick parts from the storeroom. Unless it is a very small company with
maybe ﬁve employees total, the VP shouldn’t be doing this.
1.
Assign accountability and authority to employees.
2.
Give them the training and education necessary to do their job.
3.
Provide them with the proper tools to do their job.
4.
Have clearly deﬁned job descriptions.
5.
Measure employee performance.
6.
Provide feedback to employees.
7.
Don’t do their job for them.

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #100: Complexity may cause problems and hinder
your inventory rightsizing efforts rather than help them.
I have seen a lot of this. A company is having inventory problems,
and it goes out and buys the most sophisticated application software
available. It believes the software is the solution to its problem, but it
isn’t. Take MRP systems as an example. Software suppliers will pitch the
fact that MRP will help you control inventory and establish inventory
priorities. This is true, but the operative word in the previous sentence
was “help.” If you continue to do things the same sloppy way you did
before and your BILL of Integrity is not accurate, all you are doing is
automating your problem so that you can get bad data faster!
You cannot continue to do things the same old way and expect to get
different results. In fact, more than once I have suggested to clients that
they postpone the MRP implementation until they have their BILL of
Integrity in order.
1.
Don’t write complex procedures that no one can understand or
follow.
2.
Don’t buy and try to implement complex computer programs
without providing education on why you are doing it and what
you are trying to accomplish.
3.
Don’t buy and try to implement complex computer programs
without providing proper training on how to use the software.
4.
Throwing complexity (and money) at the problem isn’t the answer.
5.
Follow the mantra of the engineer: combine, simplify, eliminate.
6.
After doing step #5, look to automate what’s left.
TIP #101: Begin your lean initiative in an area of your
supply chain where opportunities for improvement are
signiﬁcant. For most manufacturing companies, this is
usually the factory ﬂoor.
You can start a lean initiative just about anywhere in your company,
but you should start where the opportunity to eliminate waste is greatest.
For most manufacturing companies, that is the factory ﬂoor. The cost of
goods sold (COGS) is usually the highest cost of a manufacturing company.
COGS is made up of material, labor, and overhead — material is usually
over 50 percent of the total COGS. So follow the inventory.
However, if for some reason you have decided to start in the ofﬁce,
look for your most paper-intense supply-chain link. More often than not,
there are a lot of wasteful activities associated with lots of paper.

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

297
TIP #102: If you want to achieve success with a lean
initiative, you must have a plan in place prior to starting.
Don’t expect your lean initiative to be successful unless you have a
plan in place. Your plan should include the following:
1.
Education program consisting of three types of education:

What is lean?

Why are we doing it?

How do we do it?
2.
Different education for different employees:

Management education

Lean team members

All other employees
3.
Pick areas to focus on (can be multiple areas at the same time).
4.
Pick cross-functional lean team(s).
5.
Pick team leaders.
6.
Set guidelines as to what is off limits (personalities, raises, etc.).
7.
Set criteria for each area chosen.
8.
Provide work area for brainstorming.
9.
Provide the lean team with the proper tools.
10.
Establish time lines for each lean initiative. It’s never over, but at
some point you may want to move on to something else and then
come back to that area at a later time.
11.
Assign a management facilitator who can help the team accomplish
its goals by removing obstacles.
12.
Benchmark current performance.
13.
Let all employees know what is going on, and keep them informed.
14.
Have a plan to rotate all employees through a lean initiative so
that everyone gets a turn.
15.
Recognize lean teams for success.
TIP #103: When beginning your lean initiative, don’t focus
on eliminating inventory; focus on eliminating waste. A
major beneﬁt of eliminating waste will be the rightsizing
of your inventory.
Although it appears that there is a dichotomy between TIP #101 and
TIP #103, the goal of both TIPs is to eliminate waste. In many cases,
companies have too much inventory. If you eliminate waste, you will be
able to operate with less inventory in your supply chain. Inventory
reduction is a beneﬁt of getting lean and eliminating waste.

298

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #104: Moving from a push manufacturing philosophy
to a pull manufacturing philosophy will greatly beneﬁt
your inventory rightsizing efforts.
Pushing inventory downstream will result in large WIP inventories.
This is particularly true if the downstream work center can’t keep up with
the upstream work center providing it with work. The problem gets
compounded if the receiving work center has a machine breakdown or
quality issues. Before moving to a pull system, synchronize the production
rates between work centers, as explained in Chapter 6. Pay particular
attention to your exit work center. This is the last work center in an
operation sequence, as opposed to the gateway that would be the ﬁrst
operation in the ﬁrst work center of a product routing. The pull system
will not work well without this coordination.
TIP #105: If multiple locations are pulling products from
the same source of production, inventory movement must
be coordinated and carefully planned for.
For example, you have two different work centers using the same part
number coming out of the machine shop. Each work center requires
different lot sizes. Work center A uses the part in quantities of 25 pieces
to a lot, and work center B uses the part in quantities of 50 pieces to a
lot. If work center B pulls at a rate twice as fast as work center A, the
machine shop will have to adjust its output to meet the demands of both.
Don’t forget, in all likelihood your machine is making other parts for other
work centers, so the coordination will require some trial and error. You
should start the pull system at a work center where the demand is relatively
constant and known.
TIP #106: When implementing a pull system, gradually
reduce the lot-size quantity until you have achieved the
smallest possible lot size. The ideal goal would be to
produce a lot size of one.
Start your pull system with the same lot size previously used in the
push system. Reduce the lot size by some factor (maybe 10 percent) and
analyze whether the reduction impacts the ﬂow of pieces out of the pulling
work center. If the pulling work center runs out of work before the
upstream work center can resupply it with a new lot, then you need to
increase the throughput of the upstream work center to match the rate
of pull from the downstream work center. If there is no noticeable impact
on the ﬂow between work centers, reduce the lot size again by some

How Much Inventory Should We Make?

299
factor (maybe another 10 percent). Continue to go through this iteration
until you have reduced the pull quantity down to a lot size of one.
I realize that for some products a lot size of one is unreasonable. The
ﬂashlight product line for Woodstock is a good example of a product that
cannot reach a lot size of one. Go as low as you can. The goal of one
is just that: a goal. You may never get there, but you can probably reduce
your lot sizes to smaller quantities for many of your products.
TIP #107: The storeroom is a good place to start your
inventory rightsizing efforts. Inventory accuracy begins
with the receipt of inventory into the storeroom.
Your furthest upstream process is receiving goods into your storeroom,
which will be transformed into a ﬁnished product at some point in time.
So that is where it all begins. What better place to start?
1.
Develop a policy and standard operating procedure (SOP) for
receiving, storing, and picking materials from the storeroom.
2.
Identify a list of personnel who are authorized to be in the
storeroom.
3.
Send out a notice to all employees advising them of the new
operating policies and procedures.
4.
Educate and train personnel assigned to the storeroom.
5.
Have a reprimand procedure in place for violators of the SOP.
6.
Nothing should move out of the storeroom without some type of
authorization (paper, signal, computer).
7.
Keep a transaction log of all movement into and out of the
stockroom.
8.
Start a cycle-counting program.
9.
Periodically conduct a good housekeeping campaign.
TIP #108: Establishing an authorized control procedure for
goods moving into and out of the storeroom will greatly
improve your opportunity to rightsize your inventory.
TIP #107 mentions developing an SOP for the storeroom. Taking that
TIP a step further, you will need an authorization procedure as part of
the SOP. The policy should be clear, simple, and easy to follow. The
upstream work center can pull goods from the storeroom without any
personnel leaving the work center. Today, most systems generate a pick
list that can be the authorization. The storeroom can have storeroom clerks
deliver the material directly to the requesting work center, or it can be
transported by some automated means like a conveyor system.

300

Rightsizing Inventory
I will conclude this section with a brief narrative. A client told me that
after the storeroom shutdown at the end of the normal work day, he had
one work center working overtime. The work center needed some parts
from the storeroom, but it was closed. Someone from the work center
climbed over the fence and retrieved the needed parts. Because it was
against company policy (for obvious safety reasons), they were afraid to
report this event, and the transaction went unrecorded. I was told this
was a frequent occurrence. Obviously, this caused inventory accuracy
issues. What the person didn’t realize was that at another time when
someone went to pull that same part, it wouldn’t be there, and a stockout
would occur, maybe, even having to send everyone in that work center
home for the day. However, if this company had excess inventory, it
wouldn’t have a stockout; it would only have an inaccurate inventory
record that could be adjusted. That’s why we like to say: “high inventory
level hides a lot of problems.” The moral to the story: follow the rules;
they are there for a reason. Table 7.3 is the latest status of the Woodstock
inventory and Table 7.4 shows the drivers of excess inventory.

Inter-Ofﬁce E-Mail
To: All Employees
July 2
From: Adriana
Subject: Organization Announcements
I am delighted to make the following announcements:
Effective immediately, Arnie has been promoted to vice
president of operations and will report directly to me.
Arnie has been with Woodstock for 25 years and brings
his vast experience to his new role in the company. I
am excited and conﬁdent that Arnie will be a signiﬁcant
contributor to Woodstock’s future. I ask that all of you
support his efforts to make Woodstock a world-class
company that we will all be proud of.
Effective immediately, Orlando has been promoted to
the position of plant manager and will report directly
to Arnie. Orlando has been with Woodstock for 15
years, and I know he will continue the excellent legacy
that our manufacturing group has established over the
years as the premier producer of quality lights. Orlando
will also replace Arnie as the Harmony Team leader and
continue with our company’s ongoing effort to right-
size our inventory.
My name is Carlos, and I am director of distribution and logistics
for Woodstock Lighting Group.
Wow! What a surprise. I wonder if Joe quit or was ﬁred. Well, it doesn’t
matter. The consensus is that he wasn’t well liked and was more of a
hindrance than a help. Every time we tried to do something positive, he
would put obstacles in the way. Arnie and Orlando are cool guys and I’m
excited about the things these guys can do without Joe getting in the way.
The biggest problem with Joe was that if it wasn’t his idea, he wasn’t
interested in pursuing it. Now maybe we can really get some things done.
I’m going to give these guys all the support I can. I trust them to make good
decisions that will help the company become proﬁtable again. I know they
will do everything in their power to prevent layoffs.
I’ve only been here three years, but I like it here. The money is good
and I’m only three miles from the house. The company has been good

enough to pay for my education, and I’ve only got one more year of college
before I get my degree; then I’ll see where things stand. If they don’t do
something about this huge inventory, we will all be out of a job. I think
it’s time everyone recognizes the importance of reducing transportation
and warehousing costs. I am certainly going to do my best to explain the
challenges and issues we have in distribution and transportation.
Role and Responsibilities
As director of distribution, I am responsible for the warehousing, picking,
packing, and transportation of ﬁnished goods to our distribution centers,
and in some cases, shipping directly to our customers. Here is an overview
of what we are responsible for:

Logistics: At Woodstock, we deﬁne logistics as the physical move-
ment of product through our supply chain. This involves all internal
movement of goods, from raw materials to ﬁnished goods.

Warehousing: We are responsible for the ﬁnished goods ware-
house (Building 4) located adjacent to our manufacturing plant
in New Jersey. In addition to ﬁnished goods for the Flashlight
Division, we also maintain the subassembly inventory for the
Spotlight Division and the spare parts inventory for the Beacon
Light Service Center.

Picking: We pick and move goods to the automated “pick and
pack” area and the shipping dock.

Automated Pick-and-Pack Center: This is the high-volume pick-
and-pack area for ﬂashlights (Building 3). We have tried to auto-
mate this operation as much as possible.

Customer order picking: We pick and pack goods for shipment
to customers.

Transportation: Our trafﬁc department coordinates movement of
product to our distribution centers, and in some cases, direct
shipments to customers.

Reverse logistics: We also coordinate the movement of all
returned goods back upstream through our supply chain.

Inventory accuracy and accountability: We are responsible for
the data integrity of all our inventory records; perpetual and
physical.

Cycle counting: We are now responsible for cycle counting (build-
ings 2, 3, and 4) all inventory, not just ﬁnished goods. Until recently,
we were only responsible for cycle counting ﬁnished goods.

306

Rightsizing Inventory

Import/export documentation: All activities (paperwork, cus-
toms, etc.) related to product moving into and out of the country.

Third- and fourth-party logistics providers: We move goods
into and out of our third- and fourth-party partners.

Government regulations: We ensure that the movement of goods
complies with all local, regional, and national regulations.
Figure 8.1 illustrates the Woodstock Lighting Group logistics network.
You will note that the outbound (downstream) ﬂow is entitled “forward
logistics,” and the inbound (upstream) ﬂow is entitled “reverse logistics.”
The arrows going in all directions reﬂect the transportation (movement)
of inventory through the supply chain. Conceptually, the more locations
we have, the higher the inventory in our supply chain, and the more
arrows (movements) we have, the greater our transportation costs.
TIP #109: The more inventory locations you have in your
supply chain, the higher the aggregate inventory in your
supply chain.

Our objective is to keep inventory ﬂowing as much as possible. The
ovals in Figure 8.1 represent inventory stopping points. Ideally, inventory
will spend very little time at these locations, thus increasing the inventory
turns for our products.
Logistics Goals and Objectives:
1.
The timely (forward and reverse) movement of goods upstream
and downstream through our supply chain.
2.
The accuracy of our perpetual and physical inventory records.
3.
Compliance with all government and customer shipping rules and
regulations.
4.
Maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for our employees.
5.
Keeping inventory in a secure environment.
6.
Ensuring as much as possible that shipments are not damaged
during storage or shipment.
7.
Consolidation of shipments to minimize costs.
8.
Rapid response to changing customer needs.
9.
Visibility of inventory requirements upstream and downstream in
our extended supply chain.
TIP #110: Cycle counting inventory will greatly improve
your inventory record (perpetual and physical accuracy)
and will have a positive effect on your inventory rightsiz-
ing efforts.
Logistics, more than any other link in the supply chain, has the greatest
amount of interaction with all other links in the chain. It touches everyone
from the receiving dock to the shipping dock. Logistics supports the
actions of all other links in the chain and must understand the needs and
requirements of the internal and external customers.
TIP #111: Movement of inventory between links in the
supply chain must be coordinated on a daily basis. If not,
your inventory rightsizing efforts will quickly dissipate
into a chaotic situation.
We started out with the idea of locating our distribution centers close
to the customers. This business model needs to be changed. Think of it
in terms of inventory. The more inventory locations we have in our supply
chain, the higher the aggregate inventory in the supply chain. The higher
inventory adds to the complexity of our planning process. This higher

308

Rightsizing Inventory
level of complexity has increased our cost of doing business. The major
beneﬁt of the old model (Figure 8.1) was that we could get product to
our customers quickly, because the travel distance and time were minimal.
Transportation efﬁciency has improved dramatically over the years,
and we believe we can deliver product to our customers just as quickly
from one central location. I don’t think a new business model of one
centralized D/C will have a negative impact on customer service, and I
truly believe it will reduce our overall inventory investment.
Table 8.1 shows four primary inventory locations: the three D/Cs and
the ﬁnished goods warehouse at the plant. In total we have four inventory
locations. At the beginning of the year we had $15.5 million of ﬁnished
goods inventory dispersed at the four locations. Table 8.1 shows the
distribution of our ﬁnished goods inventory by location.
As you can see, most of the ﬁnished goods are in ﬂashlights. The
entire beacon light inventory is here in New Jersey and very little of the
spotlight inventory is in ﬁnished goods. As you are aware, we do have
some beacon light spare parts sitting in third-party warehouses located at
major airports, but it represents less than $100,000 in value.
Before we added the 3 D/Cs we kept $1.0 million worth of safety
stock at our plant here in New Jersey. When we added the 3 D/Cs we
used the following formula to estimate safety stock:
Formula:
Where A = safety stock @ each distribution center. B = safety stock
for one distribution. C = number of distribution centers.
$.5M × 4 locations = $2.0 million total safety stock

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

While total safety stock was increased to a total of $2 million, the
safety stock at one location (the plant) was reduced by 50 percent. I don’t
know how it happened, but safety stock has grown to approximately $1
million at each distribution center. I believe that 1 or 2 of the distribution
centers should be shut down and all inventory shipped from 1 or 2
locations. We will probably have to keep California and New Jersey. Or
maybe we could turn the California D/C over to a third-party logistics
provider (3PL). Even if we kept $1 million in safety stock at our two sites,
we would be able to reduce safety stock by $1 million.
I presented this proposal to Joe last year but he rejected it. He said
the higher transportation costs would offset the inventory dollar savings.
I am going to revisit this topic and conduct a cost/beneﬁt analysis of
consolidating our warehouses. I think the study will show that while the
cost of shipments to customers will increase, it will be offset by the
elimination of transportation costs to the D/Cs. In effect, we have to look
at the total cost of transportation and inventory carrying cost. At the same
time, we cannot have a negative effect on customer service.
TIP #112: When determining the number of inventory loca-
tions (D/Cs) in your supply chain, you must look at the
total cost of inventory and the impact on customer service.
When conducting this analysis we will consider the following:
1.
Transportation costs for shipments to the D/Cs
2.
Transportation costs for shipments between D/Cs
3.
Transportation costs for shipments to customers
4.
Transportation costs for reverse logistics
5.
Inventory carrying costs at each D/C
6.
Inventory ordering costs and planning costs for each D/C
7.
The aggregate amount of safety stock in our supply chain
8.
The cost of personnel and equipment needed at each location
9.
The relationship between inventory locations and the impact on
customer service levels
10.
Availability of efﬁcient transportation where the D/C is located

Tax considerations
Transportation and Inventory
Let’s discuss transportation and its impact on our inventory rightsizing
efforts. Transportation can be deﬁned as the movement of inventory

310

Rightsizing Inventory
between locations in the supply chain. In a very narrow sense, this can
be the movement of raw materials from the storeroom to the factory ﬂoor.
In a broader sense, it is the movement of ﬁnished product to our D/Cs
and customer sites. The objectives of transportation are to move inventory
between supply-chain partners in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
Transportation can also be considered as a temporary warehouse
location for inventory, whether it is in the belly of a plane, in a railcar,
on a ship, or sitting in the back of a truck. As you are well aware, we
presently have several trailers sitting in our yard that can’t be unloaded
because we lack storage space. We are using these trailers as temporary
storage locations until we free up space in the warehouse. We are paying
for the use of these trailers. This is not what I meant when I said
“transportation can also be considered as a temporary warehouse location
for inventory.” Six months is not temporary!
There are legal aspects of inventory ownership that we have to consider
in regard to the point that ownership or title is transferred from the seller
to the buyer. The term associated with this transfer of ownership is called
“free on board” (FOB). We use public transportation carriers (mostly
trucks), and if our ﬁnished goods are shipped directly to customers they
are shipped using one of two ways: FOB seller location: ownership of
the inventory is transferred to the buyer the moment the shipment is
delivered to the carrier; FOB buyer location: ownership is transferred
when the carrier delivers the inventory to the customer.
Why is this important to our inventory rightsizing efforts? We shipped
(transported) $90 million of product last year and over half of it was
shipped FOB buyer location, which means we were responsible for the
inventory until it was delivered to the customer. That’s a great deal of
money moving through our supply chain.
Modes of Transportation
There are ﬁve primary modes of transportation that can be used:
1.
Railroad
2.
Air freight
3.
Pipeline
4.
Water transport
5.
Truck (motor) carriers
We use four of these. We don’t use pipeline transport for obvious
reasons. The primary use of pipelines is to convey crude oil and petroleum
products. I wish we could. We wouldn’t have to be concerned with

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

311
packaging, pallets, and all the other associated shipping materials. Pipeline
transport is unique in several ways. It is available to ship product 24 hours
a day, every day of the year. Weather conditions are not usually a factor.
On the negative side they have a high ﬁxed cost to construct the pipeline,
and the route (path) is ﬁxed—offering limited ﬂexibility.
Railroad
Rail is the primary mode of transportation we use to ship product to our
D/Cs in Texas, California, and in some cases to Chicago. Rail is a cost-
effective way of shipping heavy, large loads of inexpensive goods, like
our ﬂashlights, long distances at a reasonably low cost. We ship only full
car loads by the mode. When the rail car arrives at the rail yard, we have
a local carrier who puts the rail car on a ﬂatbed truck and delivers it
directly to our distribution center or in some cases directly to our customer
(distributor). For the most part, weather is not a factor. On the downside,
rail can be very slow when you consider all the stopping, coupling, and
decoupling at switchyards, and their routing ﬂexibility is limited to loca-
tions where there are railroad tracks.
Water Transport
Since we don’t do a great deal of exporting (yet!), we use water transport
on a limited basis. We ship to a distributor in Europe who is really a
fourth-party logistics provider (4PL). They differ from the traditional third-
party logistics provider (3PL) in that they subcontract some of the sorting,
billing, and shipments to others. Like rail, water transport can handle large
quantities of heavy goods at a relatively low cost. However, water transport
is slow, and in recent years port accessibility can be difﬁcult and tedious.
Air Freight
Unfortunately, we use too much air freight as I alluded to earlier. However,
the bottom line is that it is the fastest mode of transportation, and it gets
us out of a lot of trouble with customers. The cost of air transport is high
and is limited in ﬂexibility to the location of airports. Air freight regulations
limit the weight and size of shipments. We rarely, if ever, ship ﬂashlights
by air. I do remember one time, when I ﬁrst started working here, we
air-freighted ﬂashlights to a region of the country that was hit by a
devastating hurricane. For the most part, it is our beacon light service
department that used air freight to get spare parts delivered to customers.
We use too much air freight ﬂying in raw materials because of inventory

312

Rightsizing Inventory
shortages. Once that problem goes away, air freight costs will be less of
an issue.
Motor Carrier (Truck)
Truck is the most ﬂexible mode of transportation, and we use this mode
a lot. Trucks can go wherever there is a road, and in some cases where
there is no road, so to speak. However, weather can be a negative factor
with this mode of transport. We don’t own our own trucks; we don’t want
to be in the transportation business. For one thing, it’s not part of our
core competency, and for another, it wouldn’t be cost effective. We do,
however, lease one small panel truck we use to run errands and to make
local deliveries. Having that truck available has helped us avoid a crisis
on more than one occasion. When a machine breaks down, we send the
truck to pick up spare parts so that we can get the machine back up in
production quickly.
Inventory Shipping Costs
Generally speaking, it costs less to ship full truck loads than less than full
truck loads (LTL). Full loads can be shipped directly to the consignee. With
LTL, the shipment goes through a terminal where the goods are taken off
the truck and sorted, loaded, and transported to the consignee, or another
terminal. Obviously, because of the additional handling, there are additional
charges. There are four primary costs associated with transportation:
1.
Handling costs: The cost of terminal handling, cross-docking, and
break bulk.
2.
Pick up and delivery costs: Cost of the carrier pick up and
delivery.
3.
Billing costs: The cost of creating paperwork associated with the
shipment: invoices, advance shipping notices (ASNs), shipment
tracking, shipment tracing, claims forms, etc. These are either
additional charges or built into the cost of transportation.
4.
Line-haul costs: These are costs associated with fuel for the
vehicle, drivers’ salary, and the general wear and tear on the truck.
The cost per ton (weight) will vary, depending on shipment weight
and distance traveled. For example, let’s use cost per ton. The
formula is:
A = B × C ÷ D

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

313
A = cost per ton B = line-haul cost per mile C = distance moved D
= weight
For a shipment of 4 tons, traveling 500 miles, and a line-haul cost of
$6 per mile:
$6 × 500 ÷ 4 = $750
There is a direct relationship between transportation and our inventory
rightsizing efforts. Inventory has to be transported through our entire
supply chain, and the more times we move it and touch it, the higher
our costs. Manufacturing and distribution lead times are impacted by
transportation lead times. Typically, the greater the lead time, the more
inventory we have ﬂowing through our pipeline. Transportation is the
vehicle (no pun intended) used to put inventory in the right place, in the
right quantity, at the right time. How could it not affect our inventory
rightsizing efforts?
Unfortunately, there are times when we are late on a customer order
and have to ship by air freight. We conducted a study last year that showed
20 percent of our total transportation cost was for air freight. Our total
transportation cost last year was roughly $2 million, so this means we
spent $400,000 on air shipments. Not all of this cost was for shipments
to customers. About 50 percent of it was for purchased raw materials that
had to be ﬂown in for one reason or another. The point I want to make
here is that if we don’t have the inventory available when needed, it
impacts our cost. So our inventory rightsizing effort will affect our trans-
portation cost.
TIP #113: Inventory stockouts have a negative impact on
your transportation costs. Eliminating/reducing those
(stockouts) will reduce transportation and handling costs.
Stockouts cause us to back-order some customer shipments. Instead
of one transportation cost per customer order, we can have two or three
transportation costs per customer order. If we do that often enough, we
will lose customers. It’s difﬁcult enough to get new customers without
having the challenge of trying to win back a customer we already had.
Our order ﬁll rate is somewhere around 85 percent (per order). This is
not good. This means that 15 percent of the order will either be back-
ordered or cancelled. Remember, our standard ﬂashlight product line is
a commodity, readily available in the marketplace if we can’t deliver.
Every time we back-order we are adding to our costs: picking, packing,
packing materials, and transportation.

314

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #114: Stockouts result in back orders or customer
order cancellations. Order cancellations can result in lost
customers, and back orders result in higher transportation
costs.
Back orders are a challenge for even world-class companies. Just
recently I placed an order with a major catalog retailer. I ordered two
items. One was in stock and one wouldn’t be available until two weeks
later. As I wasn’t in a rush to get them, I told the customer service person
to hold the item that was available until the second item came in so that
they could both be shipped together as one shipment. I was told that
their “system” wouldn’t allow them to do that. They would ship the
available item at once and ship the second item separately when it came
in. As there was no shipping charge to me, I didn’t care; I was just trying
to save them some money (nice guy that I am!). Can you imagine how
much money they are spending on double freight charges?
Just-in-Time Delivery (JIT)
If you were to ask me what the difference is between JIT, lean, and the
Toyota manufacturing philosophy, I would say, “very little, if anything.”
By way of deﬁnition, they all focus on the elimination of waste. However,
adding the word “delivery” to JIT does have a different meaning. JIT
delivery focuses on receiving raw material and delivering ﬁnished goods
in a timely manner; that is, receiving the right material, in the right quantity,
at the right time—sometimes directly to the factory ﬂoor. Some companies
do this successfully, but we don’t do it here at Woodstock. We did have
a customer ask us to do this once but it was cost prohibitive. It was a
small chain of hardware stores that wanted us to come in and stock their
shelves once a week. But the volume was so small it wasn’t worth it to us.
Of course, companies that can do this and do it well reduce the level
of inventory they carry, and increase their inventory turns. The trade-off
is having higher transportation costs. I worked for a large manufacturing
company once that used JIT delivery with certain suppliers. It actually gave
the truck drivers badges that allowed them access to the factory ﬂoor; they
would go to the work center, check the stock, and replace the parts that
were used with new inventory. They would leave a receipt with the work
center supervisor and the supplier would bill our company once a month.
If you go with JIT delivery, you have to have a good relationship with
your supplier. For one thing, the quality of the goods must be perfect as
you typically receive a limited amount of material per delivery. JIT delivery
usually ranges from one delivery per day to one delivery per week. In

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

315
rare cases it can be multiple deliveries per day. If the quality is poor, or
the supplier misses a delivery, you face the risk of a stockout and not
having enough work for your employees. This actually happened at the
company I worked for. The supplier’s truck broke down and we didn’t
receive our expected delivery that afternoon, which was to be used on
the second shift. We had to send six people home for the day because
we didn’t have any work for them. The company was generous enough
to pay them for the day, but if this occurs on a regular basis, you will
have higher costs and late orders.
TIP #115: JIT delivery is an effective tool to keep inventory
levels low, but if your supply partner doesn’t deliver qual-
ity product on schedule, it can cause a host of irrevocable
problems.
Material Handling
Handling inventory during transportation impacts our cost of shipment.
Remember when goods are going from our plant to our D/Cs we have
the task of loading and unloading our trucks. Most, if not all of our
ﬂashlights are prepackaged ready to hang on a jay hook in a retail store.
The prepacked ﬂashlights are placed in standard size corrugated cartons
that hold from 48 to 144 assorted ﬂashlights per carton. These cartons are
then placed on a skid and a fork truck moves them on to and off of the
trucks. So getting the product delivered safely and economically to the
D/Cs isn’t an issue for us. However, once it arrives at the D/C, we do
have handling issues, which I will discuss later.
Warehousing and Inventory
I like to say, “We all live in a warehouse.” I know that I do. If you think
of your home as a warehouse, it makes a lot of sense. You buy things,
you store things, and eventually you ship things out the door. Take your
kitchen as an example. You go to the supermarket and you stock your
shelves. During the week you take food products out of storage and
consume them and dispose of the scraps (recycle). Sometimes the shelf
life expires (this happens a lot in my house!). Once a week or so, you
take inventory (cycle count) of what is left, make up a list (new order)
and go to the store to shop for new inventory (purchase), and ﬁnally go
home and restock the shelves. Like any other warehouse you sometimes
damage goods (spillage, drop an egg, etc.) and you sometimes have a

316

Rightsizing Inventory
stockout. At least once a week we run out of something and I have to
make a fast trip (expedite) to the convenience store to pick something
up. On top of that I have to pay a premium for the item. Can you relate
that to a supply-chain warehouse? I know I can.
Your clothes closet is another good example that you can relate to a
warehouse situation. You go out and purchase new clothes, wear them
for a while. One day you realize they are out of fashion (product life
cycle), got soiled and can’t be cleaned (damaged goods), or don’t ﬁt
anymore (engineering change). So you just leave them hanging in the
closet taking up space. Years go by and they are still sitting in inventory
(low inventory turnover). Does this sound familiar? You bet it does.
TIP #116: If inventory sits in your warehouse unused for
a long period of time, get rid of it. It’s taking up space
that can be used for active inventory or for some other
activity.
Warehousing cannot function as a stand-alone silo. It must be integrated
into your entire supply-chain strategy. Warehouse activities must be coor-
dinated with transportation, manufacturing, package engineering, and
other supply-chain links. The objectives of warehousing are to store, pick,
pack, and ship inventory in an efﬁcient, timely, and cost-effective manner.
Rapid response to customer needs must be the focus of these activities.
Getting back to our earlier discussion on reducing the number of D/Cs,
I am serious about this. I don’t suggest we do it all at once but over the
course of a year or so. The present model has inventory redundancy and
too much safety stock. Maintaining and stafﬁng four warehouses also adds
to our cost of doing business. I want to start by closing down the Chicago
D/C by the end of this ﬁscal year, which ends on December 31. We will
split that marketplace up between the New Jersey warehouse and the
Texas D/C.
As most of the ﬂashlight business is with large distributors or direct
to major retailers, I am conﬁdent that full trailer loads can be shipped
from Texas and New Jersey to meet the needs of our customers in that
zone. It may be more difﬁcult to shut down the California D/C and ship
those customers from New Jersey. I propose we turn the California
operation to a 3PL as I mentioned earlier.
Third-Party Logistics Provider (3PL)
By deﬁnition, a 3PL is a company that can manage all or part of our
product break bulk, pick and pack, and ship operation. I have started to

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

317
look into it and have found a 3PL on the West Coast that can provide
the following services:

Freight consolidation. They will take in full truck loads from us
and consolidate small shipments (orders) into full truck loads of
mixed product for different customers in one particular region.

Break-bulk large cartons of ﬂashlights into smaller lot boxes for
shipment to customers.

Stockpile large quantities of seasonal inventory (spotlights) in
anticipation of product demand.

Postponement of ﬁnal package assortment. We can ship dif-
ferent colors in bulk and after we get the actual order from the
customer, they can pick and pack the ﬁnal conﬁguration.

Reverse logistics. They will accept customer returns and consol-
idate them into periodic shipments back to our plant or dispose
of them as we see ﬁt.
Warehousing is no longer simply a place to store inventory. It can be
a value-added location with service provided by a third party. We will
have to understand the total cost of outsourcing the distribution function
to a third party. The beneﬁts can be signiﬁcant. We would no longer have
to buy/lease space, hire employees, or run the operation. But the trade-
off is that we will lose control of that activity and the total cost may be
higher. As warehousing and transportation are not part of our core
competency, we need to take a hard look at this.
Warehouse Automation
The pick and pack workcenter has two robotic pick and pack machines:
one box-making machine and one sealing machine that also weighs the
box contents. The machine is programmed to reject boxes when the stated
contents do not equal the weight. Figure 8.2 depicts the ﬂow of materials
through the automated pick and pack operation. The ﬁnished goods
warehouse has no automated equipment, and everything is moved by
hand truck or forklift truck.
Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS)
I spoke to Arnie about this and asked him to ask Joe to consider my
proposal to buy an automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS). Arnie
gave me what I thought was a great answer to my proposal. He said,

318

Rightsizing Inventory
“Instead of spending a half million to automate the movement of
inventory, we should spend the half million on ways to eliminate the
need to carry so much inventory.” He is right. If we can ﬁnd a way to
reduce our purchasing and manufacturing lead times, make quicker
machine set-ups and smaller lot sizes, there would be a lot less inventory
to move around. This is a case where automation is not the answer to
our inventory problem.
Bar Coding
We have started to use bar codes on all incoming materials and manu-
facturing work orders. Finished goods are not currently scanned, but we
plan to do so in the fourth quarter of this ﬁscal year. This will help with
our inventory rightsizing efforts by eliminating the mistakes made in keying
in data. We expect this to greatly improve our record keeping accuracy,
which in turn should help us improve our inventory accuracy.
TIP #117: Rather than looking to automate the movement
of inventory, focus your efforts on eliminating inventory
so there is no inventory to move.

Automated Shrink Wrap Machine
I remember taking a plant tour of a manufacturing company where a
friend of mine worked. It was late in the day and the second shift was
in full swing. Everyone was very busy, and there was a lot going on.
When we got to the warehouse where they packed ﬁnished goods on
skids, there was a guy with a roll of shrink wrap walking around a pallet
full of boxes, unwinding the shrink wrap around the boxes as he was
walking. I noticed off to the side that they had what looked like a state-
of-the-art automated shrink wrap machine just sitting there, idle. I asked
my friend why the man was performing a manual wrap when there was
this wonderful automated piece of equipment just sitting there. He said:
“Oh that thing. It constantly breaks down and takes forever to ﬁx. We
only run it when we have customers coming in so we can impress them
with our sophisticated, automated equipment. After they leave, we shut
it down and go back to our manual wrapping process.”
Actually, I believe automation is a good thing. I wish we had an
automatic shrink wrap machine. I’m embarrassed to say we do exactly
what they did in my friend’s plant; we shrink wrap by hand. The auto-
mation in our manufacturing plant has improved productivity dramatically.
We are producing more products now, with less direct labor than we had
just ﬁve years ago. The initial cost of the equipment was signiﬁcant, but
the payback time was equally signiﬁcant—less than two years.
Automated Guided Vehicle Systems (AGVS)
Joe did approve the budget to put in an AGVS system in the ﬁnished
goods warehouse. Now that Joe is no longer here, I hope Arnie continues
with the project. Boxes and other material are loaded on these trucks,
which operate without a driver. They will move along magnetic tape or
optical tape in the ﬂoor, and we can program to send them where we
want. The next step after that will be to automate the storage of items
on high shelves to maximize the use of our warehouse space. Some day,
I would like to get a “pick to light” system like those used in highly
automated warehouses.
What does warehouse automation have to do with rightsizing our
inventory? It helps us move, sort, and stock inventory in a safe, efﬁcient
way so that damage to goods is minimized, move times are reduced, and
inventory handling is kept to a minimum. This will allow warehouse
personnel to focus their time and effort on maintaining inventory count
and location accuracy.

320

Rightsizing Inventory
Picking and Pack Automation
We use printed orders to pick goods for customer orders and printed pick
lists to pick components for ﬁnal assembly. On the high-volume items,
like the standard ﬂashlight product line, we use the automated robots for
picking and packing assorted colors and sizes into shippable cartons. We
have two robot pick-and-pack machines that can pick and pack an average
assortment of 48 ﬂashlights per box every 30 seconds (each machine).
Figure 8.2 shows the pick-and-pack operation.
So each robot is packing two boxes per minute (two robots × two
boxes = four boxes per minute). The boxes are placed on a conveyor
belt and moved to the box-sealing machine, which can attach labels, seal,
and weigh six boxes per minute. After the boxes are sealed, they move
on to a staging area where warehouse clerks remove the sealed cartons
from the conveyor belt and load them onto skids. The skids are shrink
wrapped and then transported to the shipping dock where the shrink
wrap is removed (if going to different destinations) and the individual
cartons staged for loading on the appropriate truck. Following the ﬂow
diagram in Figure 8.2 the activities and locations are:
1.
Goods are received and placed into inventory.
2.
Goods are picked for the day’s production and placed in a staging
area.
3.
Automated pick-and-pack equipment.
4.
Box-sealing machine.
5.
Stacking on skid at the end of conveyor line.
6.
Rejected boxes.
7.
Staged and ready for loading onto trucks.
8.
Ofﬁce.
The automated packing and sealing are operations that are in balance
from a capacity planning point of view. However, bottlenecks occur when
the box machine jams up. The conveyor has to be stopped, and the box
overﬂow from the picking machines has to be taken off the conveyor
and put back on after the line starts up again. We are working with
maintenance to see what can be done to stop the sealing machine from
constantly breaking down. The other issue is we sometimes stage goods
for production and ﬁnd out later that we are missing one item on the
order. The staged goods have to sit while other goods are rushed into
production to replace the waiting order. Outside of those two issues, we
have more than enough capacity to satisfy our customers’ (internal and
external) needs.


321
TIP #118: Do not pick components for ﬁnal assembly
until you are assured that all components are available
in inventory.
To improve the ﬂow of inventory and eliminate non-value-added steps,
we are exploring the possibility of eliminating the staging step of the
process and picking goods as needed to go directly into the automation
line. Because we have so much excess capacity, we are actually thinking
about becoming a 3PL in the pick-and-pack operation for noncompeting
product lines. The big problem with doing this is lack of storage space.
Inventory Cycle Counting
Cycle counting is a procedure for physically auditing inventory on a
predetermined (cycle) schedule rather than taking it once a year. This
doesn’t mean that you can automatically eliminate the annual physical
inventory unless your ﬁnancial auditors say it’s okay to do so. The objective
of cycle counting is to identify inventory errors and correct them. It is
equally important that the cause of the error is identiﬁed and eliminated
so that it doesn’t happen again.
Understanding the Meaning of Inventory Accuracy
Inventory has been called “a necessary evil.” It is hard to live with, and
at the same time it is hard to live without. So we have to deal with it. I
believe inventory accuracy is the single biggest challenge we face in our
efforts to rightsize our inventory. Our entire supply chain is dedicated to
buying, making, and shipping inventory to satisfy our stakeholders’ and
customers’ needs. Who in this company isn’t involved in managing inven-
tory to some degree? Even our human resources link is involved. Its
inventory is people. It also hires, trains, and educates people on various
inventory management topics.
Inventory is also one of our largest investments and represents more
than half of our cost of goods sold. The opportunity to become proﬁtable
again lies in our ability to get our inventory down to the right level at
the right location in our supply chain. We cannot do this with inaccurate
inventory records. Our goal must be to achieve 100 percent inventory
accuracy and maintain that level each and every day of the year. A
proven tool available to us that will help us achieve that goal is called
cycle counting.

322

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #119: You cannot sell products without managing
inventory to some degree, and you cannot manage inven-
tory effectively without knowing what inventory you have
and what inventory you need. Cycle counting addresses
the issue of what inventory you have.
If we managed inventory the way Pat in ﬁnance manages our money,
we would be in good shape. It’s ironic that accounting can balance our
checking account down to the penny, and yet our inventory, which has
a greater dollar value, is so inaccurate. Granted, we have two or three
people who manage the ﬁnances and hundreds of people who touch and
move inventory. Still, that’s no excuse. Our inventory is not only inaccurate,
it’s also high, and high levels of inventory hide many business problems.
TIP #120: High levels of inventory hide many business
problems you may not even be aware of. Reduce the level
of inventory in your supply chain to expose your business
problems.
Using an inventory accuracy tolerance of ±5 percent, our inventory
accuracy last year was 88 percent. Without the 5 percent tolerance it
probably was around 20 percent. Table 8.2 shows an example of inventory
record accuracy.
In looking at this table, how would you evaluate the inventory accuracy
for this inventory?
Scenario #1: In the aggregate, we show 312 pieces in the perpetual
(book) inventory record, and 312 are physically in stock. Based
on total count, we are 100 percent accurate. However, it is not
helpful, not even to ﬁnance. If the three-part numbers are different
prices, the dollars would not be accurate. If the price were the
same for all three part numbers, then the accuracy would be
meaningful to ﬁnance. The chances of this happening are unlikely.

Scenario #2: Using a tolerance of plus or minus 5 percent, part
#60702 is 100 percent accurate. Using the perpetual inventory as
the benchmark, part #81074 shows 95 pieces in stock, and 5 percent
represents 5 pieces (95 x.05 = 4.75 = 5). Anywhere between 90
and 100 would be considered 100 percent accurate, which it is.
Part #51398 shows 92 pieces in stock and 5 percent represents a
tolerance of (92 x.05 = 4.6 = 5) 87 to 97 pieces, which makes this
part #51398 100 percent accurate. Under this scenario, all three
parts would be considered 100 percent accurate. But again, if the
cost basis were different it would have little meaning to ﬁnance.
Scenario #3: One out of three part numbers is 100 percent accurate.
Measuring accuracy between part numbers, the inventory accuracy
is 33 percent (1/3 = 33 percent).
Based on the above three scenarios, I recommend that we use scenario
#2 and measure inventory accuracy with a tolerance of 5 percent plus or
minus. There will be some exceptions. For example, the spare parts of
reﬂectors and lights used by our Beacon Light Service Department should
be measured without a tolerance, as these are critical parts needed on a
moment’s notice.
TIP #121: In order to determine your inventory record
accuracy, you must ﬁrst decide on a meaningful perfor-
mance metric and communicate it to all links in your
supply chain.
Don’t be lulled into a false sense of security. Measuring average
inventory accuracy can be misleading. Referring to Figure 8.3, note that
parts M, P, and S have an inventory accuracy of 96 percent each, yet the
probability of all three parts being available when needed to make R is
only 88 percent.
Probability = .96 × .96 × .96 = .884 = 88 percent

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #122: Don’t be lulled into a false sense of security
with inventory accuracy in the mid-90s. The probability
of a combination of parts being available when needed is
still at risk.
When calculating the overall inventory accuracy using scenario B, the
calculation is:
perpetual inventory accuracy =
total accurate records/total records checked ×××× 100 percent
Last year Woodstock counted 1,000 parts, and 880 of them were
accurate (within tolerance):
880 ÷ 1,000 = 88 percent
It should be noted that ﬁnance is concerned about the dollar value of
the inventory, but manufacturing and distribution are concerned about
the unit accuracy of the inventory. Do you have to use the same tolerance
for all parts? The answer is no. For various reasons you can set tolerances
differently for different parts. The tolerance range would depend on:

Annual usage of the parts (in units)

How critical the part is to the product

Lead time to replace the part

Dollar value of the part

Degree of difﬁculty to replace the part

Potential for quality defects
To keep it simple, we may want to establish general rules related to
A, B, and C part classiﬁcations, with A parts having the tightest tolerances
and C parts with looser tolerances. As this is a relatively new concept
for us here at Woodstock, we have started by using a 5 percent tolerance
for all parts, with the exception of the spare parts for beacon lights noted
earlier.
TIP #123: Don’t spend a great deal of time analyzing
tolerances for each part number. Pick some reasonable
percentage and start there. You can make adjustments as
necessary.

Preparing to Cycle Count
Even though we decided on a record accuracy deﬁnition and established
inventory accuracy tolerances, we couldn’t just go on the ﬂoor and start
counting stuff. For example, what do we do if an inventory record and
physical inventory were out of balance. Who would adjust the record?
What caused the discrepancy? Will/can it happen again? In fact, who is
going to count, and how often? You see, there are many questions to be
answered before we could begin.
We began by mapping the inventory process, from incoming raw
material to ﬁnished goods going out the door. We also documented the
inventory transaction steps related to each inventory movement. We
wanted to understand where the opportunities for errors could occur and
mistake-proof those processes as much as possible without hindering the
inventory ﬂow. One of the things we found out was that the same part
number could be stored in multiple locations in the storeroom. We decided
to consolidate the same part number into one area where possible. We
accomplished this by coming in to work on a Saturday when things were
quiet. We felt it was important not to disrupt the daily operations in the
warehouse and ﬁnished goods warehouse.
We started out thinking we could use two cycle counters, and we
wanted to ﬁll those positions from within. We posted the cycle counter
job position on the bulletin board in the plant and we were pleased to
get four people who were interested. We selected two people: one person
from receiving and one person who was a ﬂoater between work centers.
This was a good start. Human Resources staff put together a cycle-counting
education program, and they were trained in the mechanics of cycle
counting. After the training (ten other people attended, including me) we
designed a cycle-counting process and procedure.
As we were well into the new year, we didn’t want to wait for the
traditional year-end inventory so that we could start with a clean slate.
We also couldn’t afford the time to stop production for ﬁve days (that’s
how long it took us last year) and take a new physical inventory. We
decided to jump right in and start cycle counting. Our ERP software
provides the vehicle for us to do this. I’ll let our Information Technology
(IT) staff explain this to you. They will do a better job than I will. We
systematically count inventory on a daily basis, and over the course of
the year everything gets counted.
We have about 3000 different part numbers that have to be counted
and have established the following count cycle:
A items: 600 part numbers: (3000 × .20); count once a month

326

Rightsizing Inventory
B items: 900 part numbers: (3000 × .30); count once a quarter
C items: 1500 part numbers: (3000 × .50); count every six months
The results thus far have been rewarding. We have already increased
our overall accuracy from 88 percent to 93 percent. We found that one
of the biggest causes of inventory inaccuracy was that people were taking
goods out of the stockroom without authorization. As you may recall, we
now have a locked storeroom and that has helped a great deal.
Reverse Logistics
One last topic I would like to cover before I leave is reverse logistics.
We have always accepted customer returns. I wish I could say, “With no
questions asked,” but that’s not true. Rudy has a sales policy: “If your
customer returns something, the sales credit gets deducted from your
commission statement.” Needless to say the sales people do everything
in their power to get the customer to keep the goods. But times are
changing. Adriana has said she wants a reverse logistics policy in place
by the end of September.
Reverse logistics is the reverse ﬂow of product back upstream through
the supply chain. It can start with customer returns and go as far back
as the suppliers we buy from. Goods come back from customers for
various reasons: repair, refurbishing, damaged, recycling, or disposal. We
are even considering taking back customer overstocks. Some companies
are reselling returned products into secondary markets and are treating
reverse logistics as a proﬁt center.
Taking reverse logistics a step further upstream in our supply chain,
we would like to sell back some of our excess raw materials to our
suppliers. Maybe they can move them into their secondary market. It has
to be a win–win situation for both parties. There are 3PL and 4PL logistics
providers who have added reverse logistics to their services. As some of
our ﬂashlight returns are recyclable, they have to be disposed of properly,
and we plan on using one of these companies because it specializes in
that sort of service.
TIP #124: Consider outsourcing your reverse logistics
function if it is not part of your core competency, or you
lack the resources to properly dispose of returned goods.
Reverse logistics can be one of the best opportunities to rightsize
our inventory. We have so much excess inventory that still has value in

other markets. I believe we can move a lot of product this way. I think
Eddie should contact some of our key suppliers and see if we can work
together to move some of the excess raw material back upstream. Rudy
should set up a sales team to do nothing but sell our returned goods
and seconds into new markets. On some of these items, if we just
recover our manufacturing costs we will be doing well. I see it’s getting
close to the time to end the meeting. I understand Dinesh is scheduled
to speak with you about information technology. He is a very bright
guy. He and his team are really helping us replace inventory with
information. If fact, they are a tremendous asset to our entire supply
chain. I will close by saying that you can count on us in distribution to
cooperate in any way we can to help with our inventory rightsizing
efforts. Thank you for your time.
Inter-Ofﬁce E-Mail
To: Supply-Chain Managers
July 2
From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory: $36.7 Million: Down $3.3 Million
since the ﬁrst of the year
We met with Carlos from our distribution group and
what follows in this e-mail is a summary of that meeting,
including tasks to be performed. The detailed minutes
of the meting will be published shortly and we ask that
you share them with your team.
Note that inventory again went down in June from $38.1
million to $36.7 million. This represents a decrease of
$1.4 million for the month. Sales were close to forecast
but we weren’t able to scale back production in time.
July production will be reduced so we expect a dramatic
drop next month. We were still able to reduce raw
material inventory by $500,000. Some of the things that
we are doing are starting to take effect. We are very
pleased with our progress thus far.
1.
Distribution is responsible for the warehousing, pick-
ing, packing, and transportation of ﬁnished goods to
our distribution centers, and in some cases, directly
to our customers.

328

Rightsizing Inventory
2.
Simply stated, it is responsible for the movement of
inventory through our supply chain, from moving raw
materials to ﬁnished goods.
3.
Its business goals and objectives call for the timely
(forward and reverse) movement of goods upstream
and downstream through our supply chain.
4.
Though all links in our supply chain are responsible
for inventory (and inventory accuracy), they are
charged with ensuring that everyone follows com-
pany procedures and that inventory record accuracy
is at the highest level possible.
5.
We are analyzing our distribution network and are
considering shutting down one or two distribution
centers by the end of the year.
6.
Our largest distribution cost is transportation.
7.
We are running out of space in our storeroom and
ﬁnished goods warehouses. We are storing some raw
materials on trailers in our yard.
8.
Rather than looking for more space, the correct solu-
tion to this problem is to reduce inventory levels.
9.
Because of the overall reduction in inventory, we are
going to off-load those two trailers this week.
10.
Our primary modes of transportation are rail and
truck. Although we have used a lot of air freight in
the past, we expect this cost to be reduced dramati-
cally because of our inventory rightsizing efforts.
11.
Inventory levels have grown in proportion to the
number of inventory locations in our supply chain.
12.
Our customer order ﬁll rate is around 85 percent; this
is not good. Our inventory rightsizing efforts will help
us to improve our ﬁll rates.
13.
We have explored the possibility of offering JIT deliv-
ery to our customers but have ruled it out for now. It
is not currently a cost-effective process for us.
14.
We are exploring JIT delivery with some of our key
suppliers. We are looking at the trade-off of higher
cost per unit versus the cost of carrying inventory.
15.
The pick-and-pack warehouse has automated equip-
ment, but the ﬁnished goods warehouse does not.
16.
Management has rejected the idea to buy an AS/RS
system. It was felt the focus should be on reducing
inventory and thus eliminating the need to automate
the movement of inventory.

329
17.
We have started to use bar-coding in our operations.
This should improve our efﬁciency and eliminate data
input errors.
18.
The budget has been approved to purchase an AGVS
system. This will improve our efﬁciency considerably.
19.
A bottleneck in the pick-and-pack area has been iden-
tiﬁed, and maintenance is working with production
to get this ﬁxed so that it doesn’t happen again.
20.
We will no longer prestage materials unless all mate-
rials for the order are available.
21.
We are looking to eliminate the staging area (non-
value-added step) in the pick-and-pack room and
move material directly to the automated equipment.
22.
We have decided on a metric for measuring inven-
tory accuracy. This is explained in detail in the min-
utes of the meeting. Please pass on to all of your team
members.
23.
We have developed a cycle count procedure and
hired cycle-counting personnel who are performing
this task on a full-time basis. Our goal is to move from
an inventory accuracy of 88 percent at year end, to at
least 99 percent by the end of this year. We are already
making progress and inventory accuracy is currently
at 93 percent.
24.
We are looking to outsource our reverse logistics
operation to a 3PL or 4PL as it is not part of our core
competency.
25.
We would like to operate reverse logistics as a proﬁt
center. We are working with Rudy and Eddie to see if
we can start moving raw material inventory upstream
to our suppliers and ﬁnished goods inventory further
downstream into a secondary market.
Please review the minutes of the meeting and pass on
the information to your supply-chain team. If you have
any ideas on improving the activities mentioned or
have questions about them, please do not hesitate to
contact any member of the Harmony Team. Please see
Figure 8.4 for the latest version of our inventory right-
sizing model.
On a personal note, I am honored to be the new Har-
mony Team leader. Arnie and his team have done an

outstanding job and I look forward to being part of the
team and continuing the legacy they have set.
Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
In Chapter 8 we covered the distribution and transportation links, and
added 16 more tips and several simple formulas to help you rightsize
your inventory. Distribution is the furthest downstream link in your internal
supply chain and the link that delivers product to your customers. As we
discussed in this chapter there are many inventory costs associated with
distribution and the most signiﬁcant cost can be transportation. Let’s review
the 16 tips discussed in this chapter and ﬁnd out how to apply them to
your company.
TIP #109: The more inventory locations you have in your
supply chain, the higher the aggregate inventory in your
supply chain.

If you have only one location that you distribute your products from,
then you are probably okay. However, if you are experiencing difﬁculty
in reaching your entire marketplace and experiencing poor customer
service (on-time delivery), you may want to consider multiple distribution
points. This doesn’t mean you have to own the distribution points. You
can outsource the distribution function to a 3PL or 4PL whose core
competency is in the ﬁeld of distribution and transportation.
On the other hand, if you have multiple points of distribution you
might want to go the other way and eliminate some of them or, as
discussed above, turn the function over to another party. Look at it this
way, at every point of distribution you have safety stock, and the aggregate
safety stock is going to be higher than if you only had one point of
distribution. Keep in mind that turning over the distribution function to
a third party will not eliminate the need for safety stock at its location. It
might be lower than if you ran it, but it will not be eliminated.
My suggestion is to spend some time looking into a 3PL or 4PL
relationship. Use the formula discussed in this chapter to see what the
potential is to reduce safety stock.
TIP #110: Cycle counting inventory will greatly improve
your inventory record (perpetual and physical) accuracy
and will have a positive effect on your inventory rightsiz-
ing efforts.
Those of you who have a high level (95 percent to 99 percent) of
inventory accuracy are probably already doing cycle counting (that’s why
it’s so good). For those of you with an inventory accuracy of 94 percent
or less, you should seriously consider cycle counting. Some of you may
not measure inventory accuracy at all and have no idea how accurate
your inventory records are. But if you are experiencing a high number
of stockouts you may ﬁnd that the root cause of the problem is inaccurate
inventory records. You should consider cycle counting if:

Your inventory record accuracy is less than 95 percent.

You are experiencing a high number of stockouts.

You have extraordinarily long lead times to replace inventory.

The value of the inventory is signiﬁcant.

The inventory item is critical to your ﬁnished product.
TIP #111: Movement of inventory between links in the
supply chain must be coordinated on a daily basis. If not,
your inventory rightsizing efforts will quickly dissipate
into a chaotic situation.

332

Rightsizing Inventory
Moving inventory between supply-chain links is like conducting an
orchestra; every piece must ﬁt together at the exact time so that the end
result is a coordinated effort of music, with a wonderful sound that is
enjoyable to hear.
You cannot just develop a standard operating plan and procedure and
then forget about it. Each and every business day you must communicate
within and between supply-chain links to keep the ﬂow of material moving
from location to location, like a pipe with a liquid ﬂowing constantly.
When situations change you must react to those changes quickly. It’s one
thing to recognize that a change in plans has occurred; it is another thing
to be able to react and adjust to the situation as quickly as possible. This
is why we say visibility and ﬂexibility are two characteristics of a world-
class supply chain. To synchronize the ﬂow of inventory through your
supply chain:

Monitor inventory levels daily.

Review and adjust lead times as necessary.

Establish inventory performance metrics.

Formalize your inventory review procedure.

Cycle count your inventory.

Communicate with each other to avoid surprises.

Respond to inventory changes quickly.
TIP #112: When determining the number of inventory loca-
tions (D/Cs) in your supply chain, you must look at the
total cost of inventory and the impact on customer service.
Inventory costs money, not just the cost of the item itself. When
determining the number of inventory locations in your supply chain, you
have to ask yourself:
1.
Can we supply the entire marketplace from one location?
2.
How many locations do we need?
3.
Where should the distribution locations be located?
4.
Should we own or outsource the distribution link?
5.
Will the total transportation costs increase or decrease if we have
multiple locations?
6.
Will total inventory investment increase or decrease if we have
multiple locations?
You are the only one who can answer these questions. You have to
look at the trade-offs between a single point of distribution and multiple
points of distribution. The cost trade-offs you should consider are:


333

Inventory cost

Warehouse cost

Transportation cost

Lost sales cost
Estimate the total cost for each solution (single or multiple locations)
before making your decision. Like all other business decisions, consider-
able weight should be given to the impact on customer service and
company proﬁtability.
TIP #113: Inventory stockouts have a negative impact on
your transportation costs. Eliminating/reducing those
(stockouts) will reduce transportation and handling costs.
If you have inventory stockouts, one of three scenarios occurs:
1.
Customer cancels the entire order.
2.
Customer allows you to ship what you have and cancels the balance
of the order.
3.
Customer allows you to ship what you have in stock and allows
you to ship the balance at a later date (back order).
Which option is the most costly to your company? If I had to guess I
would pick scenario number one. However, if any of these options occurs
often enough, you will lose the customer—the worst possible situation.
It is difﬁcult enough to get new customers, so you don’t want to lose the
ones you already have. If the stockout is because of a raw material
shortage, you will have two transportation costs to contend with, to say
nothing about the cost of multiple machine set-ups (stop making the
current part and set up the machine for the new part, then go back to
the original part), and the expediting attention required to rush the order
through your supply chain.
How can you avoid stockouts?
1.
Plan ahead.
2.
Improve your inventory record accuracy by cycle counting.
3.
Put procedures in place to ensure that suppliers deliver on time,
and when they can’t, to notify you well in advance of the material
need date.
TIP #114: Stockouts result in back orders or customer order
cancellations. Order cancellations can result in lost custom-
ers, and back orders result in higher transportation costs.

334

Rightsizing Inventory
Although similar to TIP #113, there is a subtle difference. This tip
addresses scenario number 3 under TIP #113, where the customer allows
you to ship back orders. Back orders cost money, but you already knew
that. I did an analysis some time ago for a major brand name that sold
its products through large, prestigious retail chains. The brand name, too,
knew back orders were costing it money, but it didn’t know how much.
To ﬁnd out the cost (estimate) we looked at:
1.
The total number of back orders for the year, including the number
of times a single order was back-ordered. One order could have
as many as ﬁve back orders. At that time it was an acceptable
policy with the theory being, “Put something on the shelf to be
sold now, and not wait for a complete order.” Given today’s
competitive environment, I’m not sure that would ﬂy.
2.
Average number of items back-ordered per order
3.
Average cost of duplicate packing materials: boxes, peanuts, car-
tons, tape, etc.
4.
Average paper cost: order, packing slip, pick list, shipping label,
bill of lading, etc.
5.
Average pick time per order
6.
Average handling cost
7.
Average transportation cost
In summary, we found that the company was spending millions of a
year in back-order costs. We didn’t even look at the cost of bringing the
goods in from their suppliers (overseas). The morale of the story is that
back-order cost could have a serious negative impact on your proﬁtability.
You need to understand what it is costing you to ship back orders to
your customers. You might be surprised.
TIP #115: JIT delivery is an effective tool to keep inventory
levels low, but if your supply partner doesn’t deliver qual-
ity product on schedule, it can cause a host of irrevocable
problems.
If you can implement a JIT delivery program with your key suppliers,
you can reduce the amount of raw material inventory you carry in stock.
Although the rewards are great (reducing inventory for the right reason
is always a beneﬁt), the risks can be just as great. In order for a JIT
delivery program to work effectively, the following must occur:

The relationship with the supplier must be solid. By solid I mean
a true, trusting partnership.

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

335

There must be beneﬁts to you and your supplier for this to work
well.

Supplier quality has to be perfect.

Supplier delivery must meet your expected production schedule.

Your planning process (as to when you need the materials) must
be exact.

Your internal inventory record keeping must be accurate.

You must have a contingency plan in place if your supplier fails
to deliver on time.
Start with the supplier you trust the most. It doesn’t have to be your
largest supplier or your most important inventory item. Get the bugs out
of the system before moving on to other suppliers.
TIP #116: If inventory sits in your warehouse unused for
a long period of time, get rid of it. It’s taking up space that
can be used for active inventory or for some other activity.
This tip gives you a tremendous opportunity to reduce inventory. It’s
what I call the “low hanging fruit.” Almost every company has some
inventory sitting around that hasn’t had any activity for some period of
time. It’s easy to identify but will take a lot of tedious work on the part
of someone; however, it is worth it. Here is what I suggest you do:
1.
Ask IT (or do it yourself, if you’re able to) to generate an inventory
aging report that identiﬁes all inventory items where there has not
been any activity for some speciﬁed period of time. I recommend
one year or greater.
2.
Develop a spreadsheet by category of inventory: raw material,
subassemblies, and ﬁnished goods.
3.
Ask product design to breakout the raw materials and subassem-
blies into two (where-used report) categories:

Those who have a BOM to identify what the part “goes into.”

Those who have no BOM (you will ﬁnd some of these!) and
therefore no “goes-intos.”
4.
For those parts with a BOM “goes-into”:

Find out if the upper-level BOM is still active, if so use it.

If not active, see if you can substitute it for a similar part.

If not, get rid of it: sell it (reverse logistics program) or scrap it.
5.
For those parts without a BOM:

Ask product design if the part can be used elsewhere (substi-
tute/replacement/new product).

If not, get rid of it: sell it or scrap it.

336

Rightsizing Inventory
6.
For ﬁnished goods:

Provide sales with a list of inactive items.

Provide sales with an incentive to sell them.

If not, get rid of it: scrap it.
It is important to keep ﬁnance in the loop when you are discounting
the sales price or scrapping the product. You will have to keep an audit
trail of all transactions so that ﬁnance can properly account for the
inventory. It may have an inventory reserve account that can apply.
TIP #117: Rather than looking to automate the movement
of inventory, focus your efforts on eliminating inventory
so there is no inventory to move.
As I stated earlier, automation is a good tool when applied for the
right reason. Your focus should be on reducing the amount of inventory
in your supply chain. If you can reduce your inventory enough, you may
ﬁnd that you don’t need to automate the movement of it after all. Now
that wouldn’t be so bad, would it?
If the nature of your business is such that automation will improve
the safety of your employees and is an enhancement to environmental
concerns, then by all means automate if you can. But automation for
automation’s sake is a waste of money that could be best spent elsewhere
in your supply chain to rightsize your inventory.
TIP #118: Do not pick components for ﬁnal assembly
until you are assured that all components are available
in inventory.
Many companies perform a process called “kitting.” That is the picking
of all the parts for a product (work order, production order) at one time,
putting them in some type of bin or tote, and then moving them to the
work center where needed (staging). If all the parts are not available to
assemble, then the kit just sits there until they are. After a while, someone
will come along and take a part out of the bin that they need to ﬁnish
another job. This common technique is called “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
I don’t know where that expression came from, but it has been around
for a long time. After a while you will have a lot of kits clogging up the
aisles, and they are missing more than the original part. At this point
chaos reigns. If this is happening in your plant my advice to you is:

Put the partially completed kits back into inventory.

Make sure you do the proper inventory transaction!

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

337

Ask IT if the ERP system will allow you to run a phantom pick
list. (A review to see if all parts are in stock before generating the
actual pick list).

Pick only those work orders where all the parts are available.
Of course, like most inventory requirements, your inventory records
must be accurate. If they are not, then you are back to square one, picking
orders where all parts are not available.
TIP #119: You cannot sell products without managing
inventory to some degree, and you cannot manage inven-
tory effectively without knowing what inventory you have
and what inventory you need. Cycle counting addresses
the issue of what inventory you have.
Cycle counting is a proven method of improving your inventory
accuracy. Success stories abound. However, before you actually start cycle
counting you must have a plan of action in place:
1.
Benchmark your current level of inventory accuracy. The best time
to do this is when you take the annual physical inventory. However,
if the year already started, don’t wait. Take a random sample from
a cross population of parts and establish an estimate of your
inventory accuracy.
2.
Identify personnel who will do the counting.
3.
Decide if job is full-time or part-time.
4.
Provide training and education to cycle counters.
5.
If your ERP system has a cycle count program, make it part of the
education and training program.
6.
Identify what to count and when to count it (ERP will help with
this).
7.
Have a procedure in place to adjust records to match physical
inventory.
8.
Find the root cause of the inventory error and ﬁx it so it doesn’t
happen again.
Number 8 above is very important. I like to tell my clients, “Don’t
focus on inventory accuracy. Focus on ﬁnding out what caused the
inventory to be inaccurate, ﬁx it, and inventory accuracy will take care
of itself.”
TIP #120: High levels of inventory hide many business
problems you may not even be aware of. Reduce the level

338

Rightsizing Inventory
of inventory in your supply chain to expose your business
problems.
Do not attempt to drastically rightsize your inventory levels all at once.
It would be great if you could, but not at the expense of poor customer
service and inefﬁcient supply-chain operations. It could be a disaster.
Follow the step-by-step approach taken in this book. The inventory model
at the end of each chapter shows a logical ﬂow and process you can
follow. It is an iterative process. Rightsize inventory; take the time to
understand the impact on customer service and supply-chain operations.
If no negative impact results, repeat the cycle again.
As you begin to reduce inventory you will encounter problems. You
must solve the problem that having less inventory has created. Once that
is ﬁxed and you can operate with this lower inventory, do it again; another
problem will arise, ﬁx it, and continue to rightsize inventory. It is going
to be a never-ending process, but well worth the effort.
TIP #121: In order to determine your inventory record
accuracy, you must ﬁrst decide on a meaningful perfor-
mance metric and communicate it to all links in your
supply chain.
As you saw from the Woodstock case study, there are several ways
to measure inventory accuracy. Woodstock chose scenario #2, as would
most companies. There can be exceptions as were pointed out. Zero
tolerance is the way to go on critical parts, as deﬁned by your company.
One thing is for sure: Operations measuring inventory accuracy in dollars
would have very little meaning. Of course ﬁnance needs to measure
inventory accuracy in dollars. Don’t start out by making the tolerance
too tight; you may never achieve it and get frustrated. After you have
some experience with cycle counting, you can then tighten the tolerance
to an achievable level.
TIP #122: Don’t be lulled into a false sense of security
with inventory accuracy in the mid-90s. The probability
of a combination of parts being available when needed is
still at risk.
As shown in the example in this chapter, if you have three parts in
inventory, all with an inventory accuracy of 96 percent, the probability
of all three being available at the time they are needed is 88 percent. If
that part is needed to ﬁnish off a customer order … well, you know what
could happen. How high should the inventory accuracy be? The answer

How Much Inventory Should We Stock?

339
depends. I have worked with companies with a stated inventory in the
85 to 90 percent range that experienced very few stockouts. Of course
you could argue that, in absolute terms, their inventory was high, well
over the tolerance. Inventory inaccuracy doesn’t always mean that it is
lower than the tolerance range; it could just as well be inaccurate on the
high side. I believe you should continue tightening your tolerances until
stockouts are eliminated.
TIP #123: Don’t spend a great deal of time analyzing
tolerances for each part number. Pick some reasonable
percentage and start there. You can make adjustments as
necessary.
Because you are going to cycle count the part anyway and adjust the
inventory record, that particular record will now be 100 percent. Toler-
ances are helpful as an overall measurement of the absolute (total)
accuracy of the inventory records. I would recommend you start with a
tolerance of no lower than plus or minus 5 percent and no higher than
plus or minus 10 percent. If you start out with high tolerances, start to
tighten them up until they reach 5 percent and then evaluate how tight
you want to make them. Although zero tolerance is the goal, it will be
difﬁcult to achieve and maintain over time. However, it is reasonable and
possible to have an accuracy in the high 90s (97 to 98 percent) and for
some “A” parts, 100 percent accuracy.
TIP #124: Consider outsourcing your reverse logistics
function if it is not part of your core competency, or you
lack the resources to properly dispose of returned goods.
Effectively managing returned goods from customers and moving all
materials back upstream in your supply chain is an effective way to help
rightsize your inventory. You should consider the following:
1.
Is reverse logistics part of your core competency?
2.
Is it part of your business strategy?
3.
Can it be a proﬁt center for us?
4.
Can we work with our suppliers to dispose of raw materials?
5.
Can sales sell off our excess ﬁnished goods inventory in other after
markets?
6.
Should we outsource the reverse logistics function?
7.
How should we organize to handle this function?
8.
What changes do we have to make to our current customer return
policy?

340

Rightsizing Inventory
Management should put together a cross-functional team that can
review and answer these questions. I don’t know the answers to these
questions for your speciﬁc situation. What I do know is that this is a great
opportunity to rightsize your inventory and make money at the same time.
You just have to focus your efforts, and you can make this happen. Table
8.3 shows the latest status of the Woodstock inventory and Table 8.4 is
a list of the drivers of obsolete inventory.

What Information about 
Inventory Do We Need?
Harmony Team Meeting: September 21
Woodstock Inventory: $34.1 Million
My name is Dinesh, and I am vice president of information tech-
nology for Woodstock Lighting Group.
We get blamed for everything. Just because we have the latest in Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) software, everyone thinks our problems should
have gone away. I’m really getting tired of it. The users don’t understand
that the system is only as good as the data going into the system. What’s
that old saying: “Garbage in and garbage out.”? Well we have plenty of
that going on. What’s worse is that Adriana and the other executives view
our group as an expense, rather than a company asset that can help us
strategically and tactically.
I’ve been around the IT industry a long time, going back to the old
mainframe days where all information was centralized. Technology is
changing at a rapid pace, and I have all I can do to keep up with it. I get
a ton of magazines, e-mails, and newsletters about the latest technology,
but who has the time to read all that stuff? It seems like as soon as we have
installed the latest version of some technology, the suppliers are announcing
a new version. I’m buried. We are also having difﬁculty keeping these new

342

Rightsizing Inventory
young people interested in what we are doing at Woodstock. IT has the
worst turnover in the company.
My people are constantly asking me to go to management to get addi-
tional funding, so they can buy some new gizmo that just came out or
attend a seminar on some new tools they think we can use. I just don’t
have the budget for it. So I’m right in the middle of things. I’ve got users
complaining that we aren’t giving them what they need, and I’ve got my
people complaining that we should have more technology. Our major
suppliers and customers are light years ahead of us in the use of technology,
and if we don’t keep up we won’t survive.
Now it’s inventory. Last year it was forecasting. I wonder how long this
focus will last. I’ll miss my good friend Joe. Now I don’t have anybody to
go to lunch with. It’s bad enough I have to work with these people all day
long, I don’t have to eat lunch with them, too. Joe knew how to survive.
He would just say yes to everyone and do what he wanted to do anyway.
I’ve tried that, but I’m not in as powerful a position as Joe was. Even though
we were both VPs, he controlled a lot more than I do. I don’t know if people
respected him or were afraid of him. I do know outside of me, he had very
few friends here at Woodstock. I miss you, Joe.
Technology has changed dramatically over the years and so has the
title of our department. We started out being called the data processing
(DP) department, then it was the management information systems group
(MIS), and today we are called the information technology (IT) team.
Even though our name has changed we continue to perform the role of
“keepers of the information,” or should I say, “keepers of the data”? There
is a difference between information and data, which I will explain as we
discuss our role and responsibility in the supply chain.
Role and Responsibilities
Timely Movement of Data
Our supply chain is large in terms of geography and the number of users
we support. In fact, if you count our employee automated attendance
reporting system, everyone in the company is a user of our systems.
Although the plant and distribution centers move product through our
supply chain, we move data through our supply chain. Our customers
are all users, upstream and downstream. We go as far as the extended
supply chain, with the furthest users upstream being some of our key
suppliers who we interact with (integrated systems) and the furthest
upstream users being our customers (distributors), and in many cases, our
customers — customers who interact with our sales and service teams.

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?

343
Internet Technology Provider
We ensure that our entire supply chain has access to our systems through
our data integration services. This includes the capability to enter customer
orders and supplier orders, customer returns, and complaints. This Internet
technology allows people to reach us from anywhere in the world, 24
hours a day, 365 days a year. Our responsibility is to ensure system access,
security, and data integrity.
Supply-Chain Coordination
We coordinate data movement through the integration of various systems
that allow for the downloading and uploading of data to each link in our
internal supply chain, as well as to speciﬁed external links in our supply
chain. This coordination revolves around predetermined schedules and
sequences of data movement. The objective is to provide all members of
our supply chain with the same information. Unfortunately, inventory data
resides in several separate systems, and we have some difﬁculty keeping
the inventory data in sync.
Real-Time Data
The Internet availability on a global basis requires that we move data on
a real-time basis so that records are updated as transactions occur. When
a customer order is entered, the inventory records must be immediately
updated so that duplicate allocations do not distort the inventory avail-
ability records. This is a challenge for us. Not all of our applications run
in real time. Some are batch updated at the end of the business day. So
during the period of time before the batch update, the inventory records
are out of sync.
Conversion of Data into Information
Some of our systems convert the data into report formats, but in many
cases our end users can compile their own reports using data downloaded
from our various applications. This becomes a particular challenge when
they download inventory information. For example, if planning, manufac-
turing, sales, and distribution attend a meeting on inventory management
at 10 A.M., they will go to the application they use most frequently to
get their individual information. Well, at 10 A.M. our inventory tracking
systems are not in sync and everyone goes to the meeting armed with

344

Rightsizing Inventory
different inventory information. This causes chaos and inevitably a heated
debate follows about whose data is the most accurate.
TIP #125: When dealing with multiple inventory systems in
your supply chain, you must identify which one is the pri-
mary inventory reporting system for the entire supply chain.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)
Provide Information for Strategic Planning
Our management team uses the data in our systems to make plans that
support the company’s long range goals and objectives. For example, it
uses historical data going back several years, along with current forecasts
of supply and demand to develop our sales and operations plan, which
was previously discussed by Rudy.
Provide Information for Tactical Planning
Information is provided to each link in our supply chain to generate,
monitor, and report activities that support the strategic plans of the
company. Information (data) must be synchronized and aggregated on a
timely basis so that all supply-chain plans (tactical and strategic) support
the company’s goals and objectives. An example of this would be the
ﬁnancial budgets of each link in our supply chain.
Provide Information for Operational Planning and Execution
While the focus of strategic and tactical data is on analysis of data, the
focus on operational data is on transaction reporting. In most cases our
end users are responsible for the input of transactions, and we provide
the computer programs that update the inventory records. For example,
the planning department provides planning data for our MRP program
(lead times, MPS, and lot sizes) and the engineering department provides
BOM data. Our system takes that data and runs it through our MRP
application and provides a basic report of “action notices.”
TIP #126: The timing of inventory transaction reporting
into the system is critical to maintaining accurate inven-
tory records.

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?


Let me put it all together into one inventory-related example. From a
strategic viewpoint, inventory for our ﬂashlight division has a make-to-
stock inventory strategy. That is, we buy raw materials, manufacture the
ﬂashlights, and put them into inventory. Our ERP system keeps track of
the inventory to see if it matches our strategic plan (raw material or
ﬁnished goods). As you heard previously, the ﬂashlight inventory was
positioned correctly from a strategic viewpoint.
From a tactical viewpoint, ﬂashlight inventory is located at our distri-
bution centers, our main plant, and some 3PLs. Our system monitors
inventory at each of those locations, and our database keeps track of the
separate inventory locations.
From an operational point of view, as transactions occur (orders and
shipments), the inventory records at each location are updated and
reported to our central inventory system, located here in New Jersey. So,
in summary, we keep track of inventory at all three planning levels.
TIP #127: Although inventory reporting may be tracked
separately for different supply-chain links, it should be
aggregated into one system to monitor performance
against company strategic and tactical plans.
Data Warehousing
Our IT infrastructure consists of six different legacy systems, each
purchased and implemented over the course of many years. This
patchwork of six different databases is held together with a series of
interface programs as depicted in Figure 9.1. These six legacy systems
are deﬁned as:
1.
General accounting: Our oldest system. Performs general account-
ing functions such as general ledger, accounts payable, and
accounts receivable. Interfaces with 2 and 5.
2.
Purchasing: Purchasing department bought this stand-alone system
to aid it in its purchasing functions. Interfaces with 1 only.
3.
Computer-aided design: Stand-alone system; doesn’t interface with
others.
4.
MRP II system: Used mostly for MRP; interfaces with 5 and 6.
5.
Warehouse management system: Used by distribution centers for
inventory management. Interfaces with 1, 4, and 6.
6.
Forecasting system: Used for demand planning; interfaces with 4
and 5 only.

346

Rightsizing Inventory
Our most recent purchase is our ERP system, which will be the primary
inventory system for our company. This will be our data warehouse where
we will combine the data from these other legacy systems. This primary
data warehouse will be the location of data for analysis, while the other
databases will be used for reporting transactions in real time, which will
be sent to the main data warehouse for updating the database once every
hour. Our goal is to do this in real time some day.
We want this interaction between systems to be as seamless as possible
so that all our supply-chain links can function without system interruption.
Equally important is the timing of the information. Our supply chain must
be able to respond to change quickly. We don’t do this well today. It
sometimes takes days for data to be transformed into meaningful infor-
mation. I have proposed to Adriana that we move toward one centralized
system for transaction reporting. Having one centralized inventory system
will greatly enhance our ability to “rightsize” our inventory.
TIP #128: Inventory must be reported by its current loca-
tion in your supply chain, so that you can effectively
rightsize your inventory across supply-chain links.

To some degree IT is responsible for inventory accuracy — in the
sense that once reported, the data is maintained accurately. The
accuracy of the data itself is the responsibility of the appropriate
supply-chain link, which is charged with the inventory accountability.
TIP #129: Information technology is responsible for inven-
tory data integrity once it is reported to the system. How-
ever, the actual transactions of inventory movement
(physical movement) are the responsibility of the appro-
priate supply-chain link.
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
ERP can be deﬁned as an application software suite, consisting of modules
related to various business processes, which can be used as one common
source of data storage and transaction processing. There was a time when
there were literally hundreds of software vendors (suppliers) competing
for the opportunity to sell their software (then called manufacturing
resource planning [MRP II]) to manufacturers and distributors. The ﬁeld
of competitors has since narrowed to a few major vendors.
ERP systems offer the user the capability to plan at the strategic, tactical,
and operational level. These systems are huge in the sense that they offer
packaged solutions to most of the links in our supply chain. The company
has the ability to pick and choose which modules are right. ERP systems
are also available by industry-speciﬁc applications, using the terminology
and applications unique to a speciﬁc industry classiﬁcation (Standard
Industry Classiﬁcation [SIC] code). These systems allow you to conduct
“what if” simulations. You can input certain data scenarios (without
impacting the actual system data) to evaluate certain cause-and-effect
situations. These ERP system models have been built on the basis of years
of use and experience.
When we purchased our ERP system I made a silent commitment not
to make major modiﬁcations to the software. I strongly believed (and still
do) that we would beneﬁt from the pure vanilla (as is, no changes) system.
In time, after we truly understand the system, then we can look at changes,
if they are warranted.

348

Rightsizing Inventory
ERP systems impact inventory management in many ways. Here are
some examples:

Finance and accounting. General accounting of inventory trans-
actions for accounts payable, accounts receivable, and the general
ledger. Financial analysis and ﬁnancial management of inventory
assets.

Engineering. Inventory BOM information and inventory routing,
work center, and cost data.

Materials management. Inventory planning and purchasing
information.

Sales and marketing. Inventory forecasting, sales history, cus-
tomer master data.

Distribution. Finished goods inventory levels and locations.

Manufacturing. Raw material inventory levels and locations, WIP
inventory tracking.

Service department. Inventory levels, locations, and costs, BOM
information.

Maintenance department. Spare parts inventory levels and loca-
tion. Spare parts supplier information.
TIP #130: Do not attempt to modify or customize the
inventory management applications within your ERP sys-
tem until you truly identify a real need to change it.
As you can see, ERP systems have something related to inventory for
all links in our supply chain. An argument can be made that human
resources has a need for managing inventory also. After all, it manages
our most important inventory asset — our employees.
Supply-Chain Management Systems
Software gaining popularity beyond ERP systems is supply-chain manage-
ment software. This is sometimes referred to as supply-chain event man-
agement (SCEM) or supply-chain process management (SCPM). This
software allows you to perform simulations and respond rapidly (if you
have your act together) to unplanned events such as impact orders. Impact
orders are orders not originally planned for that have the potential to
disrupt the supply chain. It allows you to track inventory from raw material
to ﬁnished goods through each link in your supply chain. The system
will advise you when inventory is outside established inventory guidelines.
By utilizing this built-in warning system, your supply chain can quickly

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?

349
collaborate to reduce the risk of inventory stockouts. This visibility occurs
in a real-time dynamic mode so there are no surprises down the road.
Suppliers, 3PLs, and your own plant will be able to adjust inventory levels
more rapidly than the traditional approach of replacing inventory. I
envision this software to gain in popularity. However, we at Woodstock
have a long way to go before we consider using it.
Other Tools and Technologies
Bar Coding
This is a label applied to a part or package that is machine readable
(usually scanned) and identiﬁes the inventory item. You see these on
products all the time during the course of your daily life. We are currently
using bar-code labels on the cartons and the inventory package but not
on the actual ﬂashlights. At the present time we don’t see the need to
have the item itself bar coded, as the packaged ﬂashlight is our ﬁnished
product. We are also going to put bar codes on our work orders issued
to the factory ﬂoor. The major beneﬁts to us related to inventory man-
agement are that we can speed up data entry and accurately record
inventory and work order movement. There will be far less inventory
transaction errors when we bar code all inventory in our supply chain.
This is a personal goal of mine.
Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID)
RFID is a technology I would really like to use at Woodstock some day.
Essentially, a smart chip is placed on the inventory item, which sends a
signal that is picked up by a device that reads the item information
embedded in the chip. Unlike bar coding, where you have to ﬁnd the
label to scan it, these devices can read the signal even if it’s not visible.
This will be great in the supermarket, too. We will no longer have to lift
up that case of water or soda so that the checkout clerk can ﬁnd the bar
code and then scan it. You can track full loads of inventory that are in
transit somewhere in our supply chain. This is a great thing. Again, this
is a useful technology that will help us rightsize our inventory some day,
but like some of the other technologies I’ve spoken about, we are not
there yet. We need to get the basics down ﬁrst.
TIP #131: Do not attempt to implement sophisticated
technologies to help you rightsize your inventory until

350

Rightsizing Inventory
you have built a basic foundation of inventory manage-
ment processes and procedures.
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Electronic Data 
Transfer (EDT)
Essentially, this is the transfer of information via electronic means. There
was a time when this required proprietary software, and customer orders,
invoices, and shipping notices were sent this way. Today this has become
a more open environment due to the advent of the Internet for such
purposes. Wireless services have enhanced the use of this service even
further. Virtually anyone, anywhere in the world, can electronically (if
they have access) send and receive inventory information instantaneously.
Of course, this is good and bad. Good in the sense that your inventory
records are accurate and time sensitive — bad, if they are not. I don’t
have to point out which side of the coin we fall on, do I?
E-Business and E-Commerce
Internet technology has enabled Woodstock to sell our inventory to a broad
base of customers around the world. This practice of electronic commu-
nication provides a business model where customers can obtain information
about our products, order, and pay for them in a matter of minutes and
in a cost-effective way. This business model also extends upstream where
we can use the same model when dealing with our suppliers. The beneﬁts
of Internet technology allow us to reach a larger marketplace in a timely,
cost-effective manner. We need to expand the use of this technology and
leverage it as part of our corporate strategy. Equally important to us and
our customers, the Internet allows us to communicate information at all
levels and through all links in our supply chain.
Woodstock Web Site
We have been working with Rudy and Adriana to enhance our Web site
with an online catalog offering our products (ﬂashlights and residential
spotlights) directly to the general public. Of course, it isn’t realistic to
expect someone to buy a ﬂashlight valued at $2.59 (plus shipping and
handling) over the Internet. We are focusing the catalog on the high-end
(cost) spotlights for homes, and we will include some of our unique
ﬂashlights such as our batteryless ﬂashlight, lanterns with remotes, walking
stick lights, crank lights, and glow-in-the-dark ﬂashlights.

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?

351
Our strategy is that the consumer will buy our spotlights directly from
us rather than a distributor. At the same time, we hope to attract those
buyers who perceive the value-added uniqueness of our ﬂashlights. We
are currently conducting an analysis to determine the impact on our current
sales model of selling directly to distributors. We need to determine whether
we are just shifting the same sale from one selling model to another or
whether we will obtain new customers through this new sales channel.
TIP: #132: Buying and selling inventory (products) over
the Internet (through a Web site) can speed up the sales
cycle, increase sales, and increase inventory turnover, but
there are pitfalls to overcome.
Our e-business strategy must go beyond just offering our products for
sale through our Web site. It should include a tactical strategy of commu-
nicating with our extended supply chain: our customers and suppliers.
Through our CRM and SRM strategies we hope to improve the ﬂow of
information through our entire supply chain. Our challenge is to replace
inventory with information. If we can do that, we will have a positive
impact on our inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #133: Replacing inventory with information will greatly
enhance the opportunity to rightsize your inventory.
Project Management
We have learned the hard way that when we (IT) are put in charge of an
end-user application implementation, it typically fails to be implemented
successfully. It is perceived as an “IT project,” and the end users don’t take
ownership of it. Our end users have many daily chores and tasks on their
plate and will focus their attention on those tasks that they are measured
and rewarded on. Our initial MRP implementation is a good example. It
took us over two years to implement, and we had many problems. Everyone
blamed IT for the failure. We ﬁnally recognized our mistake and put Cyndie
in charge of the project. It went fairly smoothly from then on.
TIP #134: Application software implementations should
be managed by the supply-chain link most impacted by
the application.

pany rather than a “cost of doing business.” We can help the company
by providing data and information that will strategically and tactically
position Woodstock to become a world-class company. We impact every
link in our supply chain and believe we can play an important role in
our company’s inventory rightsizing efforts.
Thank you for your time.

From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory: $34.1 Million
We continue to rightsize our inventory, thanks to all of
you. You will note from above and Table 9.1 that inven-
tory was down to $34.1 million by the end of August,
and as we approach the end of September the down-
ward trend continues. Customer orders in August actu-
ally exceeded the forecast by a small amount and all
three categories of inventory went down for the month.
This is due to all the things we have learned and exe-
cuted since the ﬁrst of the year. Not only is inventory
being reduced, it is also being shifted in our supply
chain to match our company strategy. We met today
with Dinesh from our information technology team and
learned many things that will help us as we further
attempt to rightsize our inventory. What follows is a
summary of that meeting, followed by our latest version
of our inventory rightsizing model as depicted in Figure
9.2. The details of the meeting will follow in the min-
utes, which will be published shortly:
1.
There is a difference between data and information.
We gather statistics and other important pieces of
data and store it in our database. This data is then
extracted from the database and converted into infor-
mation in the form of reports and documents for
analytical purposes.
2.
Every employee in our supply chain uses our IT ser-
vices in one form or another.

3.
While manufacturing and distribution move product
through our supply chain, IT moves data and infor-
mation.
4.
IT interacts with our extended supply chain, which
includes customers and suppliers, and in some cases
our supplier’s suppliers, and our customer’s customers.
5.
Because of our Internet capability we are able to com-
municate with our supply-chain partners anywhere
in the world, 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.
6.
IT is responsible for ensuring system access, security,
and data integrity.
7.
IT coordinates and synchronizes the timely move-
ment of inventory data through our supply chain.
8.
It has been decided that our ERP system will be the
primary and ofﬁcial record of our inventory status.
9.
IT provides services and technology that help us
achieve our strategic, tactical, and operational
objectives.
10.
Inventory data is stored in our “data warehouse” and
can be extracted by end users for various inventory
reporting.

Rightsizing Inventory
11.
IT is only accountable for inventory accuracy once it
has been entered into the system. End users are
responsible for the accuracy of the physical and book
inventory transactions themselves.
12.
No changes (modiﬁcations) will be made to any of
our packaged application solutions until we truly
understand how the software works; even then
changes must be justiﬁed.
13.
IT is looking into the next level of supply-chain soft-
ware that will help us react to unplanned inventory
changes by alerting us when inventory levels are out-
side stated parameters.
14.
We are going to extend the use of bar codes in our
company, and this will enhance our inventory-report-
ing accuracy.
15.
We have decided that while RFID is an excellent tech-
nology, we have a long way to go before we can con-
sider using it.
16.
We are using EDI and EDT. They are working well for
us by eliminating the need to pass paper back and
forth. On the other hand, we are struggling to
improve our inventory accuracy so the inventory
information we pass back and forth will have more
meaning.
17.
IT announced that our Web site may soon include a
sales catalog offering our spotlights and unique ﬂash-
lights to the general public. This will be dependent
on the analysis now being conducted by sales and
marketing to determine if this will attract new busi-
ness or if we will be taking business away from our
distributors.
18.
It has been decided that IT will no longer be the
project leader on end-user application implemen-
tations. It will, however, continue in the role of
facilitator, ensuring that the technology is used
correctly.
19.
IT should be considered as an asset to Woodstock. It
should play a greater role in the development and
implementation of technologies that will help Wood-
stock achieve its strategic, tactical, and operational
objectives throughout our entire extended supply
chain.

their thoughts with you and your teams.
Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
The reader will notice that the volume of pages in this chapter is the
smallest thus far. This does not imply that IT is less important than the
other links previously discussed. On the contrary, IT is on par with all
other links in the supply chain. IT is such an integral link and so tightly
woven with the other links that it is difﬁcult to set it apart as a separate
link. Much of the detail about its role in the supply chain has already
been covered in other chapters. I do believe IT warrants a separate chapter.
Without the IT link providing timely data and information, your company’s
ability to react to changing market conditions will be compromised and
your inventory rightsizing efforts will suffer.
I have added ten more TIPs for you to use in this chapter. The following
discussion will review these TIPs and how they can be applied successfully
in your company.
TIP #125: When dealing with multiple inventory sys-
tems in your supply chain, you must identify which one
is the primary inventory reporting system for the entire
supply chain.
When new technology is implemented, such as ERP systems, many
end users still ﬁnd the need to keep their legacy systems because they
still ﬁnd them useful and choose not to replace them for one reason or
another. For some, it is just a question of time before they get rid of it.
While legacy systems can run alongside your new ERP system, there will
be a need for redundant data and information. Inventory data is one
such example.
It is not uncommon to see inventory residing in an old MRP II system,
a warehouse management system, and a demand planning system. The
challenge is to keep all these redundant inventory systems in sync,

356

Rightsizing Inventory
hopefully for only a short period of time. But for some companies it is a
new way of life, and the redundancy isn’t going to go away.
When dealing with such redundancy:
1.
Choose one application that will be the “primary” and “ofﬁcial”
data warehouse for all company inventory data.
2.
Establish detailed schedules of when this system will be updated
with inventory transactions from other inventory systems in your
supply chain.
3.
Advise all links in your supply chain (extended supply chain) when
the inventory records will be updated, so that everyone who has
access to the data understands what the updated inventory record
does and does not include.
4.
Pay particular attention to inventory being offered for sale through
an online ordering system (such as a Web site or sales entering
orders from the ﬁeld). These transactions may need to be updated
in real time (as the transactions occur). You don’t want to be in
the position of “double selling” your inventory. Some companies
I have done work for wish they had this problem to deal with.
TIP #126: The timing of inventory transaction reporting
into the system is critical to maintaining accurate inven-
tory records.
TIP #125 dealt with the timing of information and data that was exposed
in a real-time environment with the extended supply chain. TIP #126
focuses on the routine, daily internal transactions that may be updated in
real time or, in some cases, updated in a batch mode. A batch mode is
when transactions are accumulated (batch) and on a predetermined sched-
ule sent to the data warehouse to update the records.
What you have to be careful of here is that when reviewing the status
of an inventory item, you understand that the inventory balance you are
looking at may not be correct, because there are a “batch” of transactions
against that inventory item waiting to process that will change the balance.
You have to look at the (clock) timing of your inquiry to see if you have
the latest information.
In a complex supply chain with multiple plants, warehouses, distribu-
tion centers, and 3/4 PLs, all inventory transactions must be synchronized.
If the technology is available to update inventory records in real time,
and the need to do so exists, do it.
TIP #127: While inventory reporting may be tracked sep-
arately for different supply-chain links, it should be aggre-

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?

357
gated into one system to monitor performance against
company strategic and tactical plans.
This TIP doesn’t focus on the timing of inventory transactions but
rather the aggregation of information into one system for centralized
company reporting. At some point in time, corporate inventory perfor-
mance metrics require aggregate inventory information. For example,
ﬁnance will require the dollar value of the total inventory, and inventory
management, for planning and operational purposes, requires that total
units be reported. Inventory should also be aggregated by category: raw
material, WIP, and ﬁnished goods. If you already have this data in one
data warehouse, that’s ﬁne. If not, it should be.
Performance metrics dashboards are typically aggregated for manage-
ment so that it can see at a glance the status of inventory all rolled up
into a few numbers. This requires that you ﬁnd a way of feeding this data
directly onto computer screens. This can be accomplished by feeding
information through a series of interfaces from various systems or feeding
directly from the data warehouse of choice for the entire company. The
former will work, but the latter is a more effective approach.
TIP #128: Inventory must be reported by its current loca-
tion in your supply chain so that you can effectively right-
size your inventory across supply-chain links.
This TIP deals with the movement of inventory through your supply
chain, link by link. Inventory may be tracked through:
1.
Raw material receipt
2.
Raw material inspection (if required)
3.
Raw material storage location
4.
Raw material movement to your gateway work center (ﬁrst oper-
ation at the ﬁrst work center)
5.
WIP inventory through operations and work centers. Some indus-
tries will not ﬁnd this a necessary step, particularly if the operation
times are short — usually if less than eight hours.
6.
WIP completed
7.
Finished goods to warehouse
8.
Finished goods to ﬁnal assembly (or packaging)
9.
Finished goods to distribution center or warehouse
10.
Finished goods to transportation company
11.
Finished goods to customer
Not all companies will ﬁnd the need for tracking inventory through
all the steps mentioned here. However, it is important for all companies

358

Rightsizing Inventory
to know when a raw material arrives (step 1) and when it is shipped
(steps 10 and 11). The rest are dependent on your need for the information.
For example, planning and purchasing may require inventory item (by
location) information on a daily basis, and executive management may
require aggregate inventory (by location) on a monthly or quarterly basis.
To determine how often to report inventory by location, you have to
answer two questions:
1.
What is our need to capture information?
2.
What is the cost and effort required to capture the information?
Of course, the need to capture information may win out over the cost
to capture it. So cost might be a moot point. At the very least, you have
to capture the inventory coming into your supply chain and the inventory
going out of your supply chain. Keep in mind we are speaking about
capturing information in units for operations and dollars for ﬁnance.
TIP #129: Information technology is responsible for inven-
tory data integrity once it is reported to the system. How-
ever, the actual transactions of inventory movement
(physical movement) are the responsibility of the appro-
priate supply-chain link.
Inventory accuracy should be viewed from two perspectives: the
reporting of the item as it moves through the supply chain and the integrity
of the item information as it is accepted by the system and as it resides
in the system. Inventory management systems have been around a long
time and formulas are not rocket science.
However, a 7 and a 9 being misread by the person doing manual data
entry will still be accepted by the system. The result will be inaccurate
information being reported to the system. Is that the responsibility of IT?
I don’t think so. If you have two part numbers where all digits are similar
except for that misread 7 instead of a 9, you are going to have accuracy
problems, but the integrity of the data once reported will be ﬁne. It will
perform the mathematical equations exactly as programmed.
Cycle counting and bar coding will greatly enhance your data accuracy,
but at any point in the transaction where you have human input to the
data, you have to be careful. That is why we stress getting to the root
cause of why an inventory record is inaccurate. I have seen many sophis-
ticated and state-of-the-art inventory systems fail because an operator
wrote down the wrong quantity on a work order. It can happen to the
best. The challenge is to keep it to a minimum.

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?

359
TIP #130: Do not attempt to modify or customize the
inventory management applications within your ERP sys-
tem until you truly identify a real need to change it.
Modifying your ERP system is fraught with problems:

The cost to modify the system could be signiﬁcant.

The time it will take to modify the system could be signiﬁcant.

You may be modifying the system to do what you did in the past,
but is what you did in the past the best way?

The software supplier may not support the software once you
modify it.

If you don’t document the changes you will have future problems.

Upgrading to the next release of the software will be difﬁcult or
impossible.

If (when) the person who did the modiﬁcations leaves, you’ve got
problems.

If you have other systems that the modiﬁed ERP system has to
interact with, you will have issues to deal with when those other
systems are upgraded.

If the software supplier modiﬁed the system and it goes out of
business or stops supporting the software, you will have problems.
So, you can see you really need to think twice (or ten times) before
you decide to modify the system. Knowing all this, why do so many
companies do it anyway? It’s a good question, and I wish I had a good
answer for you. When I ask this question, I usually get two answers:

“Our business is unique, we are different.”

“The vanilla system doesn’t satisfy the requirements of our … link.”
When buying a new ERP system I would suggest:
1.
Look at industry-speciﬁc software. Many software suppliers have
taken their vanilla system and modiﬁed it to ﬁt speciﬁc industry
niches. If they have done the modiﬁcations, it now becomes a
standard software package for you.
2.
Ask the supplier to put you in contact with their customers who
are in a similar business and are using the vanilla system or their
industry-speciﬁc system. Talk with them, visit with them.
3.
Ask how the new software has helped them rightsize their inventory.

360

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #131: Do not attempt to implement sophisticated
technologies to help you rightsize your inventory until
you have built a basic foundation of inventory manage-
ment processes and procedures.
There is an old saying that goes something like this, “Continuing to
do things the same old way and expecting different results is foolish,” or
words to that effect. If you have a poor foundation of managing inventory,
don’t expect your ERP inventory system to help you. On the contrary,
you can expect to receive inaccurate information even faster than you
did before.
Before implementing a new ERP system, look at your current method
of processing inventory information:
1.
Understand the requirements of all links in your supply chain.
2.
Conduct a requirements deﬁnition.
3.
Map the current inventory information ﬂows.
4.
Compare the results with the new ERP system to ensure that all
requirements of the links have been covered.
5.
If a current process is not covered by the new ERP software, see
if the process can be eliminated.
6.
If not, see if you can work around it.
7.
Document the new way you will handle inventory transactions.
8.
Get everyone’s buy in.
9.
Communicate the new inventory transaction foundation to all sup-
ply-chain links.
10.
Having done that, you are now ready to implement the new ERP
system, as is.
11.
Work with it as is (pure vanilla) for at least six months so that
everyone has had a chance to evaluate it.
12.
Necessary modiﬁcations must be justiﬁed before making changes.
Of course, you may determine that modiﬁcations are necessary before
you even begin. Although I don’t usually recommend modifying the
software, I do understand there are situations where it is necessary. You
must understand the risks I pointed out earlier.
TIP: #132: Buying and selling inventory (products) over
the Internet (through a Web site) can speed up the sales
cycle, increase sales and increase inventory turnover, but
there are pitfalls to overcome.

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?

361
The Internet has and will continue to redeﬁne the way products are
sold and move through your supply chain. If you are venturing out into
this brave new world beware:
1.
You must have visibility of your entire supply chain inventory
(upstream and downstream).
2.
Inventory transactions must be recorded accurately and in a timely
fashion.
3.
Your supply chain must be ﬂexible and respond to change rapidly.
4.
Inventory performance benchmarks and metrics must reﬂect these
attributes.
5.
You must have open communications throughout the entire
extended supply chain.
6.
Procedures and systems must be in place to handle both forward
and reverse logistics.
Don’t open your company up to this highly visible environment until
you have addressed these six points to your satisfaction. If you don’t
overcome these pitfalls you’re ﬂirting with disaster and you could quickly
lose any competitive advantage the Internet has to offer.
TIP #133: Replacing inventory with information will greatly
enhance the opportunity to rightsize your inventory.
More isn’t necessarily better when it comes to information. In fact,
many system end users are on information overload. They get so many
e-mails, memos and reports, it’s almost impossible to dissect them on a
daily basis. What happens is they will put it in a folder “to be read later”
and never get back to it. The key to this TIP is getting a reasonable
quantity of quality information to make inventory management decisions.
For example, if you don’t have time to read all the information sent
to you, then you surely won’t have the time to analyze it. You may miss
a key inventory ﬁgure or trend that would have caused you not to make
a particular part for inventory because it wasn’t needed. If you had the
right information at the right time, then you could have reduced or
eliminated the need for inventory. This is what I meant when I said
information can replace inventory in your supply chain.
I once had a boss who used to send out a particular inventory report
at the end of every month to almost everybody in the company. This
was in the days when the only computer reports we got were on the
old “green bar” paper. He had IT (the data processing department in
those days) print out a slew of these reports, using up at least one full
box of paper. One day he decided not to send out the report anymore

362

Rightsizing Inventory
just to see if anyone missed it. Low and behold he only heard from about
5 people out of the 30 or so who got the report. What is the moral of
the story?
1.
Identify what information the other links in your supply chain need
from you.
2.
Ask them how they are using the information in the report so that
you might be able to enhance it.
3.
Hard copy reports are passé.
4.
Don’t send out reports as an e-mail attachment if you have a
company intranet.
5.
Advise all supply-chain links where to ﬁnd the information on the
company intranet site.
TIP #134: Application software implementations should
be managed by the supply-chain link most impacted by
the application.
I ﬁnd that successful application software implementations are led by
the end user most responsible for the functionality of the application.
Although I must admit one of the most successful implementations I ever
worked on had coproject leaders, one person from IT and one person
from the end-user link. In this case it was an MRP implementation and
the coleader was the director of materials management. As a general rule,
IT should not be the project leader for an end-user application. If IT leads
the project I have found:

The end users will not take responsibility for it.

It will be perceived as an IT system.

IT will have difﬁculty getting the end users involved due to other
work commitments and other motivational factors, such as personal
performance measures and department goals and objectives.
The end users are best skilled (or should be) to deal with the require-
ments of their link in the supply chain. After all, who should know the
needs of the link best? Getting the end users to head up the project has
the following advantages:

They know what their needs are better than any other link.

If it is part of their annual performance goals and objectives, they
are motivated to get it to work successfully.

What Information about Inventory Do We Need?

363

As they interact with other links in the chain they will have a greater
understanding of the implementation impact on the other links.

They can provide the knowledge experts for particular operational
functionality.
However, that doesn’t mean that IT staff shouldn’t be involved. On
the contrary, the system won’t work without them. They also know all
the technical aspects of implementing the new technology, certainly not
a job for the novice. IT should play the role of facilitator and act as an
internal consultant on the project. Of course, it also goes without saying
that the software supplier will also play an important role in the imple-
mentation.
Is the project leader role a full-time job? That depends on the com-
plexity of the software and the size of the company. In large companies,
it is typically a full-time job for some deﬁned period of time. For example,
I have seen high director-level personnel taken out of their daily job for
12 to 18 months to head up a project with the guarantee that when the
project is over they will be placed in a position equal to or greater than
the position they held before the implementation. They literally are moved
out of their ofﬁce — in some cases moved to another building.
Many small companies can’t afford the luxury of having a full-time
project leader. In most cases it is a part-time job while they are still
performing the daily tasks. These implementations are usually less com-
plex, and the number of people they have to interact with in the other
links is somewhat less, too. That doesn’t mean it’s any easier to implement.
In fact, if ERP is a new tool they have never used before, it can be a
greater challenge than the large company has.
Who should be in charge of the inventory management functionality
of the ERP implementation? After all, I have repeatedly stated that all links
are responsible for managing inventory. The answer is that there will be
different project leaders for different functionality of the system. For
example, ﬁnance should be in charge of the inventory accounting appli-
cations, engineering for the BOM applications, purchasing for the pur-
chasing applications, and planning for the MRP applications.
Regardless of who is in charge, it should be a cross-functional team
working on the inventory application. As inventory touches all links in
the supply chain, all links should be involved. The knowledge experts
from these links can be called upon as needed. For large companies,
these too will be full-time temporary positions.

Harmony Team Meeting: October 31
Woodstock Inventory: $31.6 Million
Field Service
My name is James and I am the ﬁeld service manager for Woodstock
Lighting Group.
It’s about time they ﬁgured out that ﬁeld service can contribute to our
inventory rightsizing effort. I’ve been waiting all year for them to call me
in to discuss inventory. I was so mad I had a good mind to tell them to
go pound salt. We should have been one of the ﬁrst links they spoke with.
Oh, well, I’m here now, and I will show them how much we are involved
with inventory.
My girlfriend Louise tells me all the time that I should just quit and get
on with my life. But I can’t. I’ve made so many friends around the world
that depend on me and my team. I enjoy working with the lighthouse
managers. They are a unique breed and I ﬁnd their stories and tales
fascinating. There aren’t too many of us left that understand the workings
of a lighthouse. What am I going to do if I leave here? Service copy
machines? How exciting is that? Although it is a noble career, it just doesn’t
have that sea coast aura and intrigue. Oh, well, I’m not going to quit. I

Rightsizing Inventory
like my boss Rudy, I have a great staff, and I’ve been all over the world.
How many people can say that?
Even though we don’t manage a large amount of inventory (less than
$100,000), we can have a positive impact on our companywide inventory
rightsizing effort. We interact on a daily basis with virtually every link in
our supply chain. I have proposed to Rudy and Adriana that we expand
our ﬁeld service role to include the Spotlight Division. Some of our huge
spotlights are leased/rented out for special events, like store openings,
pep rallies, and the like. We are in the process of investigating it further
and if approved, we should be in operation about a year from now.
Role and Responsibilities
Spare Parts Sales
We are a proﬁt center and sell inventory, at a proﬁt, to lighthouses
around the world. Although the sales of new lighthouse systems have
been declining over the years, our spare parts business has been rather
steady with marginal increases each year. We have a sales forecast and
we have achieved our sales goal for ﬁve years in a row.
Service Sales
We physically install roughly 25 percent of the inventory we sell. The
other 75 percent of inventory sold is installed by the lighthouse itself or
its designated third party. We also make money on providing consulting
and maintenance services to lighthouses to enhance/upgrade their system.
It doesn’t have to be a Woodstock light system; we also service and
maintain competitor systems. Around 35 percent of our lighthouse cus-
tomers have service/warranty contracts with us. Some of the services we
provide are covered under warranty, but many are not.
Interaction with Other Links in the Supply Chain
Sales and Marketing
Our three ﬁeld service representatives and our two customer service
representatives are speaking with or visiting with customers every day.
In most cases (within the Beacon Light Division), we speak with the
customers more than sales does. We have great insight into what custom-
ers’ needs and problems are. We know when they expect to place orders,

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

we can predict when the system will need servicing, and we sometimes
know when they are planning to replace an existing lighthouse with a
new one. All this information can be made available to our CRM folks.
Although we don’t expect to sell ﬂashlights to them (at least not directly),
there is the potential to sell some of our spotlights for use along the
shoreline or for emergency purposes.
TIP #135: If you have a ﬁeld service division, get it
involved in your inventory rightsizing efforts; it has a lot
to contribute.
(Note: TIP = team important point.)
Product Design
We work with our product design link on the design of new products
and the enhancements to existing products. Last year we came up with
a new light reﬂector design that the company has applied for a patent
on. Just last week I met with Michael about eliminating three parts from
our new lantern light. This inventory reduction will reduce the lantern
cost by 20 cents per lantern, a substantial savings. We are in the process
of reviewing all of our existing ﬂashlight and spotlight products (along
with our beacon lights, which we constantly do) to see if we can apply
the things we have learned from our customers to further reduce the
number of parts in our products. This will help with our inventory
rightsizing efforts.
Process Design
We are also working with our industrial engineers to see if we can improve
the manufacturing process on beacon lights. Some of our customers have
come up with ideas that we would like to apply here at Woodstock. For
example, we mount an angle shaft, part #111604, to the rotating arm of
the light ﬁxture. When the part is installed at the customer site, the angle
has to be turned 90˚ to ﬁt on the armature. We suggested to manufacturing
that this part not be attached at the plant. We ship it as a separate part
and attach it at the correct angle at the time of installation. This saves
manufacturing one operation in a very busy work center. It reduces our
manufacturing cost and makes the installation process more efﬁcient. This
won’t reduce inventory, but in the broader sense it is helping us to rightsize
our inventory by having it at the right place at the right time.


Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #136: Field Service can help reduce inventory by
assisting product design with the reduction of parts in
your product.
Suppliers
We interact with suppliers all the time. We can help each other improve
our products so that the relationship is proﬁtable for both of us and at
the same time provide the customers with value-added enhancements.
Our goal with suppliers is to eliminate parts (inventory) in their product
and to use common, standard parts where possible. This, too, will enhance
our inventory rightsizing efforts.
Distribution
As you know, we keep a small amount of inventory at depots near the
major airports in the country. It is our responsibility to ensure that
replacement lights and ﬁxtures are shipped to customers on a moment’s
notice. We are measured on how well or poorly we do this. For domestic
customers, our goal is to deliver product within 48 hours of receipt of
the customer order. For international customers, it is within 72 hours of
receipt of the customer order. Distribution is a big help with this. It
maintains the inventory at the depots and arranges for the shipment. We
are going to eliminate the need to carry emergency inventory at the depots
and distribution centers.
All ﬁeld service inventory will be kept at the plant in New Jersey,
which is only 30 minutes from Newark Airport. Joe was dead set against
doing this, but now that Arnie is in charge, it was one of the ﬁrst decisions
he made.
TIP #137: Consolidating spare parts inventory into fewer
locations can reduce the overall amount of inventory car-
ried, without having a negative impact on customer service.
Maintenance
Field service also interacts with our own internal maintenance department
at our plant in New Jersey. Our personnel are experienced mechanics
and can ﬁx just about any machine we have. They help out the mainte-
nance team any time they can. From an inventory perspective, we use
quite a few parts that are the same and some that are similar (can be
substituted). We are working with maintenance to stock only one inventory

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

371
of those parts, so that inventory redundancy can be eliminated. This will
help us reduce overall inventory (some, not a lot, but every bit helps)
and make it easier to plan for and maintain. We are also working with
facilities management to see if it carries similar parts in its inventory. You
never know until you ask. Now that I think about it, we probably should
look at taking a tool inventory. I bet we have a lot of redundancy there
also.
TIP #138: Field service may share resources with other links
in your supply chain. By combining resources you may be
able to save money and improve operating efﬁciency.
Technology Used
We currently use a stand-alone, PC-based application to keep track of our
inventory and customer service records (warranty information). It doesn’t
interface with any of our six legacy systems. The plan is to bring all our
information over to the new ERP system within the next six months. Until
then, we have to continue bringing paper documents to each link affected
by the ﬁeld service transactions.
Inventory and Field Service
As you can see, we have a signiﬁcant impact on inventory and interact
with many links in our supply chain. When all is said and done, there is
some inventory redundancy between maintenance and ﬁeld service. The
real impact on inventory will be on “undesigning” parts from our products,
identifying where common parts can replace custom parts, and helping
make our manufacturing process more efﬁcient. We know a lot about the
customers’ inventory needs and problems. We can play an important role
in our inventory rightsizing efforts.
Human Resources
My name is Aimee and I am manager of human resources
for Woodstock Lighting Group.
I wonder why they asked me to meet with the Harmony
Team. What does human resources (HR) have to do with
inventory? Maybe they all want to get a bonus, or raise,
or some type of award for doing this. I hope not; I’m
not authorized to deal with that. Whatever it is—it better

Rightsizing Inventory
be important. I had to get up an hour earlier today so
that I could drop Alyssa and Justin off at daycare to get
here on time. Why can’t they be considerate and sched-
ule these meetings for later in the day?
I have been here for ﬁve years and really like the
employees a lot. I get a lot of satisfaction out of helping
them solve their personal issues related to company
business. To be honest, I’m really glad Joe is gone. I had
more complaints about him than any other manager in
the company. He couldn’t get along with anybody,
except Dinesh. They were like two peas in a pod. I’ve
actually had people come up to me to say how happy
they were to see him go. I think some of them were
trying to ﬁnd out if Joe was ﬁred or quit. I’ll never tell.
Role and Responsibilities
As I was on my way to the meeting I was wondering what I could possibly
contribute to our inventory rightsizing efforts. Then I got to thinking, I
deal with inventory all the time, except my inventory is unique. My
inventory is people. If I could use a corny analogy, we bring new people
into the company (raw materials), sometimes we have to let people go
(excess inventory, poor quality), and we maintain ﬁnished goods (satisﬁed,
well-trained employees). Anyway, you get the idea. It’s the latter I will
focus my talk on.
Interaction with All Supply-Chain Links
We interact with everyone, regardless of what link they work in and what
position they hold in the company.
Job Descriptions
We help the supply-chain managers develop job descriptions. Adriana
recently told me all future job descriptions will include some role in
managing inventory. She wants inventory management embedded into
the culture of the company. Each position also includes performance
metrics on which an employee’s job performance is based. Just so you
understand how important our inventory focus is, starting next year,

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

373
everyone in a particular supply-chain link will share the same performance
metrics related to inventory, whether it be inventory turns, inventory levels,
inventory stockouts, etc. We are in the process of deﬁning these metrics
now with each supply-chain manager.
TIP #139: Individual performance measures (related to
inventory) should be replaced by shared, team-based per-
formance measurements.
Salary and Beneﬁt Administration
We match up job descriptions with the going salary rate for that position
on a geographic basis, along with other job characteristics, such as expe-
rience and education. We now ask all prospective employees if they have
any experience managing inventory, in any capacity. If so, we note it in
their ﬁle as an asset to their skill set. Not having experience with inventory
is not necessarily a negative attribute (depending on the job), but having
experience managing inventory is considered a positive attribute.
Compliance with All Regulatory Agencies
We comply with all federal, state, and local government (and reporting)
agencies.
Education and Training
This is where we can be the biggest help with our inventory rightsizing
efforts. We are responsible for “Woodstock University,” our own internal
education and training facility. We develop the education and training
programs, hire the instructors, and establish the schedules. Each Wood-
stock employee is required to have 40 hours of education or training per
year. We maintain employee records to see that this happens. For spe-
cialized education and training we sometimes seek the recommendation
(for instruction) from the supply-chain link requesting the training. I keep
saying education and training (E&T). From now on I’ll just say E&T.
What’s the difference between education and training? Education
mostly focuses on the “What is it and why do it?” aspect of a topic; and
training focuses on the “how to do it” aspect. For example, as you
know, we are currently installing a corporatewide ERP system in the
company. All employees will receive varying hours of education on the
what and why of it. Those employees who will actually work with the
system will receive training on how to use it.

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #140: Education and training has to be an important
part of your inventory rightsizing effort.
Woodstock University will have a complete curriculum of inventory-
related courses delivered by classroom instruction, Webinars, self study,
or video compact disc (CD). As part of our employee improvement
program (and for advancement/promotion), each employee will be
required to take at least 40 hours of education/training per year; including
8 hours on an inventory-related topic. So far we have identiﬁed the
following courses and are working on the curriculum for each of them:

Purchasing Inventory

Managing Work-in-Process Inventory

Material Requirements Planning

Distribution Requirements Planning

Bill of Material Structuring

Cost Accounting for Inventory

Inventory Forecasting

Sales and Operations Planning

Lean Concepts
As you can see, this is an impressive list of courses. As part of our
employee new hire orientation program, we will show a 16-hour video
CD on why maintaining a rightsize inventory is so important to the
company. This isn’t a case of “Can we afford to do this?” This is a case
of “We can’t afford not to do it.”
Company Communications
One of the biggest challenges supply chains face today is communications.
That is, having all employees know what’s going on in the company. In
the past, we have made a half-hearted attempt to publish a company
newsletter once a quarter. Sometimes we did and sometimes we didn’t. Last
year we only published three newsletters. So far this year we have only
published two, and the year is almost over. Well, that’s going to change.
Starting January of next year, Adriana has stated she wants a newsletter
published once a month, and she insists it include communications about
the status of our company inventory. This is what she wants to see in
the monthly newsletter:

Total value of the company inventory graphed month by month,
in dollars

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management



Total number of inventory stockouts in manufacturing, plotted
monthly

Total number of stockouts in distribution, plotted monthly

Writeup on “Employee of the Month” for outstanding contribution
to inventory management (who they are and what they did)

A monthly “President’s Message” (which she will write herself) on
an inventory-related topic
TIP #141: Human resources can take a proactive role in
your inventory rightsizing effort by raising the visibility
of the inventory effort through formal company commu-
nication channels.
Adriana’s goal is to change the culture of the company when it comes
to managing inventory by raising the recognition and visibility of inventory
throughout our entire supply chain. I think it is a good idea, and we in
HR are looking forward to it.
We currently use the HR functionality that resides in our ﬁnancial
reporting system. Starting next year we will be using the HR functionality
of the new ERP system. We will be the second supply-chain link to go
up on the new system. Finance was the ﬁrst, and it is almost ready to
cut over to the new system. The new HR system will enhance our capability
to serve our customers (all Woodstock employees) well. As you can see,
HR is actively involved in our inventory rightsizing effort.
Maintenance
My name is Anthony, and I am the maintenance manager
for Woodstock Lighting Group.
If it wasn’t for my maintenance team, the company
would be in a world of trouble. My guys can ﬁx anything,
and I am proud of them. Mark, Richie, and I have been
together for over ten years, and we know what each
other is thinking without saying it. The other links in
our supply chain should be as lucky. I’m thrilled that
Joe is gone. He was a real pain in the neck. He wouldn’t
let us spend one extra dime on preventive maintenance
than was absolutely necessary. Arnie is a good guy, and
he really understands the need to perform preventive
maintenance. When outsiders come for a visit, they are
amazed to see some 1960 vintage machines still run-
ning— and running well.

376

Rightsizing Inventory
I’m looking forward to my honeymoon next month. I
can’t wait! Lorri is so understanding. She knows my job
requires me to work evenings and weekends. It is the
only time I can get at the equipment. It’s not that bad
though; it’s quiet, and we don’t get many interruptions.
This Harmony Team thing is a great concept. It’s not
often we get asked for our opinion and ideas. My team
and I are going to help in any way we can. Arnie and
Orlando are great leaders, and I am conﬁdent that they
will turn this company around. If anybody can do it,
they can.
Role and Responsibilities
The role of maintenance at Woodstock is broad. We do a lot of interesting
and important things. There is a ﬁne line of difference between my team
and the facilities management team. If I had to sum up our responsibility
into one sentence, I would say, “Maintenance is responsible for keeping
our machines and equipment in perfect working order without compro-
mising the health and safety of our employees.” But it can be much
more than that. We can contribute to our inventory rightsizing efforts in
many ways.
Machine and Equipment Maintenance
Needless to say, our machines and equipment make and move inven-
tory. When they break down, they can’t make and move inventory.
That alone tells you that keeping them in good working order is
important to our inventory rightsizing efforts. I will categorize mainte-
nance into several types:
Planned Maintenance (Preventive Maintenance)
Planned maintenance is also referred to as preventive maintenance or
planned downtime. We are all familiar with this type of maintenance
because we do it (or should) as part of our personal life. For example,
your car requires periodic maintenance to have the oil changed, tire
pressure checked, engine tuned up, wheels aligned, etc. If you don’t take
care of these things, what will happen? Sooner or later your car will break

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

down. If you are on vacation traveling cross-country and your car breaks
down you will not be a happy camper. Well, it is the same thing with
equipment. We have established a preventive maintenance schedule for
all our equipment. We know in advance when the equipment needs to
be shut down so that maintenance can be performed.
There are two types of preventive maintenance. There are those tasks
that the machine operators can perform themselves, like changing the
oil and general machine cleaning. We call these tasks operator mainte-
nance. Then there are those tasks like machine calibration, changing
belts, and inspecting gears that my team does. We call these tasks
technical maintenance. Preventive maintenance is a good thing to do.
As the schedule is coordinated with manufacturing, it has little impact
on production schedules.
As a general rule, we perform (technical) preventive maintenance on
weekends, and operator maintenance is performed at the end of a shift,
Monday to Friday. If the work center doesn’t have work, it will do it
during the course of the normal work day. My job prior to coming here
to Woodstock was in a confectionary plant, and every Friday during the
summer was designated as “maintenance day.” In the summer the plant
operated certain workcenters on a 4 × 10 schedule; that is, they worked
four days a week, ten hours a day, Monday through Thursday. That
work center shut down on Fridays and the plant was “turned over” to
maintenance for the day. This was a win–win situation for everybody.
The plant workers got long weekends and maintenance got to do its
work without interruption.
Unplanned Maintenance
Unplanned maintenance is when a machine breaks down unexpectedly
during scheduled production time. This can be a plant’s worst nightmare
if the problem can’t be solved immediately. Think of the inventory
disruption if you had only one machine of that type, it broke down, and
you couldn’t get replacement parts, or it took a week to ﬁx. The impact
on inventory could be signiﬁcant. Upstream workcenters would have to
stop work because WIP inventory would build up. Downstream work-
centers would have to stop because of the lack of work. Customer orders
would be late and the problem would be compounded well into the
future. That’s why we do preventive maintenance — to keep the
unplanned downtime to a minimum. We also keep a spare parts inventory
of long lead time replacement parts. If we have to, we can make many
of the replacement parts ourselves in our machine shop, but it would
also disrupt their schedule.

378

Rightsizing Inventory
Proactive Maintenance
This is our favorite task. Proactive maintenance, also referred to as pro-
ductive maintenance, is where we work with the machine and equipment
operators to improve the efﬁciency of the machines. The beneﬁts are many:

Machine ﬂexibility is improved.

Material handling is reduced.

Operator ergonomics is enhanced.

A continuous ﬂow of material is achieved.

Capacity is increased.

Lead time is reduced.

Lot sizes are reduced.
As you can see, this will have a major impact on our inventory
rightsizing efforts. We don’t do enough of this. Now that Arnie is our
leader, he has told me he wants us to spend more time taking a proactive
role in enhancing our plant efﬁciency.
TIP #142: Get your maintenance team involved in per-
forming proactive maintenance. This will greatly enhance
your chances to rightsize your inventory.
Machine Setup Reduction
One proactive task that will provide us with many beneﬁts is to reduce
the time it takes us to change over a machine from producing one product
to another. We have several complex time-consuming machine setups in
our machine shop. For example, for some of our spotlight framed lenses
we have to change out the tool, reprogram the machine and add an
additional angle axle. This can take up to eight hours to perform. Naturally,
once this setup is done, Orlando wants to make a ton of these so that
he feels the setup time was cost efﬁcient.
If we can ﬁnd a way to reduce this setup time down to minutes, that
would change a lot of things. For one thing, Orlando wouldn’t mind
making smaller lot sizes, and for another, our overall capacity would
increase. Machine time is lost because a new setup is being done. While
the machine is sitting, it is not making product, thus we have lost capacity.
TIP #143: Maintenance personnel should be part of a
cross-functional team committed to reducing machine
setup times.

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

379
We are fortunate in that we have many talented people here who work
on this. By combining their knowledge and experience into one group,
I am conﬁdent that we can make dramatic improvements in machine
setup times. I recommend we include:

Maintenance

Machine Operators

Field Service

Facilities Management

Product Design

Process Design
It also wouldn’t hurt to get our suppliers and customers involved,
when and where appropriate. Reducing setup times will give us all the
beneﬁts I spoke about when discussing proactive maintenance. Reducing
lead times and lot sizes will greatly enhance our inventory rightsizing
efforts. Perhaps the biggest beneﬁt to Woodstock will be improved ﬂex-
ibility. Improved ﬂexibility to change over production will allow us to
rapidly respond to customer needs. This will make for satisﬁed customers,
who may in turn give us more business.
TIP #144: Reducing machine setup times will increase
capacity, reduce lead times, and decrease lot sizes, which
could ultimately lead to increased sales and proﬁts for the
company.
Machine maintenance and machine setup reduction aren’t the only
activities we are involved with that impact inventory. We are also involved
in developing the layout for the new assembly work cells in Building 1.
We are working with our facilities team and industrial engineers, getting
ready to install the new AGVS system that Joe approved before he left.
Our team may be small in size, but we are large when it comes to the
contribution we can make to our inventory rightsizing effort. You can
count on us to work with all links in our supply chain to make this happen.
Facilities Management
My name is Jon, and I am the facilities manager for Wood-
stock Lighting Group.
I’ve worked here for six months now, and this is the ﬁrst
time anyone other than Joe and Arnie has asked me to

380

Rightsizing Inventory
make a presentation on what we do in facilities man-
agement. I don’t even know most of the people on this
Harmony thing they are working on. For all I know, it’s
the company singing group and they are looking for a
bass tenor to sing in harmony with the rest of the group.
However, they said they want me to describe our role
and responsibility as it relates to inventory. So appar-
ently they aren’t interested in my singing.
Talk about inventory. They’ve got so much inventory in
this facility; someone could hide in it and not be found
for months. That reminds me: I wonder if I should tell
Arnie I saw one of the ﬂoaters taking a nap during
working hours the other day? He was ﬂat on his back,
lying on a skid of cartons. I would have thought that
wouldn’t have been very comfortable, but it didn’t seem
to bother him, he was snoring away for a good half hour.
He couldn’t have a very important job if he wasn’t
missed for that long a period of time. Oh well, I’m no
snitch, let someone else deal with it. Well, here I go …
Role and Responsibilities
Most people think the only thing we do is see that the heat or air-
conditioning is working, arrange for the plowing in winter, and turn the
lights on and off. We do so much more than that. For one thing we keep
the facilities up to code so that we comply with all health and safety
regulations. I view this as the most important thing we do. However, we
also work with many of the other supply-chain links to improve the storage
and movement of inventory throughout our facility here in New Jersey.
Good Housekeeping (Part of the 5s Effort)
You are aware of the lean initiative Arnie and Orlando have got going
on in the plant. Their supervisors are responsible for the 5s campaign in
each work center, and we are responsible for keeping the general work
areas clean and clear. We are like internal policemen. Sometimes we ﬁnd
inventory sitting where it shouldn’t be, and we have to get the supervisor
to get it removed. On more than one occasion, they have blocked access
to a ﬁre exit door. This is a clear violation of the safety regulations. This

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

381
has happened a lot since I have been here. We have now painted those
areas and designated them as “clear zones.” Anyone stacking inventory
or anything else in those zones will be written up.
One of our biggest problems is in the receiving area. When some raw
materials are received in cartons, they empty the cartons and move the
inventory to a storage location. That’s the good news. The bad news is
that they were haphazardly stacking the empty cartons in front of a ﬁre
door. That was a no-no, and we quickly solved that problem. The point
I’m trying to make is that as inventory moves throughout our facility, it
can sometimes leave a wake of debris that has to be cleaned up by
someone — and that is typically us. The bottom line is, we are responsible
for keeping the areas clear for the safe movement of inventory.
TIP #145: Get facilities management involved in your
“good housekeeping” activities. It can contribute to the
improved visibility of inventory, which is an important
criterion in your inventory rightsizing efforts.
Workcell Layout
We are actively involved with manufacturing and industrial engineering
to improve our plant layout. As you know, we have an issue of material
ﬂow due to the original building designs. We are constantly trying to ﬁnd
ways to improve the ﬂow and movement of materials through this hodge-
podge. We are also building new workbenches for the new assembly light
workcell on the second ﬂoor of Building 1.
Tool Room Inventory
We have a small machine shop where we make repairs and modiﬁcations
to various pieces of equipment needed to maintain the facility in good
working order. As this room is in the same building as manufacturing
(Building 1, ﬁrst ﬂoor), we keep all the unused tools, dies, and jigs. When
the manufacturing workers need something, they come to us, and we
move the needed tool to the work center. Don’t ask me how this started.
It’s been done well before I got here.
I recommend that manufacturing moves all active tools to the appro-
priate work center and store them there. This will increase efﬁciency by
not having to wait for us to bring the tools, and it will save us time by
not having to manage inventory, which they should be responsible for.
Furthermore, we can put that space to good use.

382

Rightsizing Inventory
Shelving
We erect all the shelving used for storage of raw materials and ﬁnished
goods. We are always working with the other links in our supply chain
to ﬁnd better ways to utilize our space. As you know, we are running
out of space to put inventory in all our buildings. Just before Joe left, he
asked me if we could build up our storage area so we had more space
to store things. I told him we have gone as high up as reasonable for
safety reasons. He and I argued over this, and I said I would quit before
I would consider going any higher.
Truth be told, this was the wrong focus, anyway. I told him the focus
should be on reducing inventory so that we wouldn’t have the need for
more space. I recommend we use a philosophy of “space denial.” That
is, we gradually reduce the amount of space to store inventory. Once we
have effectively improved the utilization of that space, reduce it again.
Continuously go through this cycle until we are operating with a reason-
able amount of inventory. That’s what I would do if I were you.
TIP #146: Don’t focus your efforts on ﬁnding new space
to put inventory. Focus your efforts on better utilization
of the space you already have. Better yet, get rid of your
inventory so you don’t need the space.
Weather and the Impact on Inventory
When it snows we have to plow the parking lot and the truck bay area
so that inventory can be moved into and out of our facility. As our
buildings aren’t connected, we also have to ensure safe passage (for carts
and people) between buildings.
There is a major leak in Building 2, and I told Joe about it. We need
a new roof, but he said we couldn’t afford it. At any one time, we have
about $200,000 worth of inventory sitting under this waterfall. I told him
we couldn’t afford not to replace the roof. He still wouldn’t budge. When
it rains, we have to put tarps over the inventory. When you consider the
costs of the tarps (these are big industrial tarps) and the labor cost to put
them on and take them off, the roof would be half paid for by now.
TIP #147: Facilities management can help protect inven-
tory from being damaged during storage and internal
movement through your supply chain.
Just last week, we had to scrap $3,000 of inventory because it got wet.
I went to Arnie and he approved the expense for a new roof on the spot.

Matters got worse when I found out that the scrapped goods were needed
for a customer rush order and couldn’t be replaced for two weeks!
We have our own generator that we use when the city power system
fails. This happens a lot in the summer when their electrical system goes
on overload. By activating this system, we help keep the plant operating
so that production can continue to produce inventory with minimum
disruption. I’ll close by saying that we can contribute a lot to our inventory
rightsizing efforts. Please continue to call on us. We want to be part of
this companywide team effort.
Inter-Ofﬁce E-Mail
To: Supply-Chain Managers
October 31
From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory: $31.6 Million U.S. Dollars
As the year begins to wind down, we have made great
strides in our companywide effort to rightsize our
inventory. Our inventory has dropped from $40 mil-
lion at the beginning of the year to its current level of
$31.6 million — a reduction of $8.4 million. We have
accomplished our goal, even though sales is behind
in the forecast by roughly $1 million. All three catego-
ries of inventory went down for the month. Because
of more accurate planning information coming out of
MRP, we were able to reduce production and utilize
the ﬁnished goods inventory we had in stock. Sales
also sold off about $50,000 in obsolete inventory. Prod-
uct design continues to review slow moving raw mate-
rials as a replacement for BOM parts and was
instrumental in using $25,000 worth of substitute raw
materials to be converted into ﬁnished goods. Every-
one is contributing.
This week we met with representatives from four of
our internal supply-chain links. Although these four
links aren’t normally associated with managing inven-
tory, we believe they are an asset to our inventory
rightsizing efforts. Following is a summary of those
meetings. Details will follow in a separate e-mail later
in the week:


Rightsizing Inventory
Field Service
1.
They are a proﬁt center, selling and installing inven-
tory, having achieved their sales goals for ﬁve years
in a row.
2.
25 percent of the inventory they sell, they also install.
3.
They also provide consulting services.
4.
They are in direct contact with our customers and
provide input to our sales and marketing links.
5.
In the future, their input will be used in the CRM
system.
6.
They work with product design to develop new prod-
ucts and to enhance existing products.
7.
They have been instrumental in our efforts to elimi-
nate parts in our products, and in other cases they
have helped product design standardize on common
parts.
8.
They are working with our industrial engineers (pro-
cess design) to improve the manufacturing efﬁciency
by suggesting better ways to build our products that
will add value to the products our customers buy
from us.
9.
They also interact with some of our key suppliers on
improving the products we buy from them.
10.
They have direct responsibility for managing the
spare parts inventory sitting at depots near airports.
11.
We are in the process of eliminating the depot inven-
tory. All spare parts will be shipped direct to custom-
ers from our plant in New Jersey.
12.
When they are not in the ﬁeld, they lend their exper-
tise to our maintenance department.
13.
Several parts used by maintenance and ﬁeld service
are similar. They are looking to combine inventories,
which will reduce the overall inventory previously
carried by both links.
14.
They are going to work with facilities management to
see if they, too, use similar parts. If so, we can look
forward to combining that inventory, also.
15.
Their current stand-alone inventory management sys-
tem will be eliminated, and they will start using the
new ERP system within the next six months.

We recognize the contribution these four links are
making to our inventory rightsizing efforts. I suggest
that each of you seek their guidance and counsel in
helping achieve our collective inventory objectives. Fig-
ure 10.1 is our latest version of the Woodstock inven-
tory rightsizing model. Please review it and offer any
comments or suggestions you may have. At our next
meeting, Arnie will discuss the total supply-chain effort
to date and what we must do to sustain this new com-
pany culture of managing inventory.

Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
Too often, these supply-chain links are not involved in a company’s
inventory rightsizing effort. They should be. They have so much to offer.
I once worked with a maintenance guy who knew more about inventory
ﬂow and management than anybody else in the company. No one had
ever asked him his opinion on what should be done to make production
and inventory movement more efﬁcient. We got him involved and it was
one of the most successful inventory rightsizing efforts I was ever involved
with. Let’s review the tips discussed in this chapter. 
TIP #135: If you have a ﬁeld service division, get it
involved in your inventory rightsizing efforts; it has a lot
to contribute.
The ﬁeld service people I have met and worked with seem to have
the ability to ﬁx almost anything. Give them a screwdriver and a pair of
pliers and they get the job done. I’ve always been impressed with their
product knowledge and their ability to interact with the customer. How


Rightsizing Inventory
to apply this TIP is simple: ask for their help. It doesn’t have to be full
time. Get them to meet with you and ask them questions. They know
more about the customer than they think they do.

Educate them on what questions they should be asking the cus-
tomer.

Provide them with sales education (soft sell).

Consider rewarding them for selling products.

Structure formal meetings with other supply-chain links such as:
sales, marketing, product design, process design, and suppliers.
TIP #136: Field service can help reduce inventory by assist-
ing product design with the reduction of parts in your
product.
Field service personnel are out at the customer site almost every day
touching and ﬁxing your products. They know the strengths and weak-
nesses of your product. They may ﬁnd that some parts you have included
in your product aren’t necessary. I had a client once who sold electrical
replacement kits to OEMs. The kits included washers and lock nuts. While
visiting the customer, ﬁeld service observed the maintenance person using
the old washer and nut rather than the new ones in the kit. When asked
why, the maintenance person said it was easier to get on because they
were already greased up and readily available at the point of installation
and, besides, why waste a perfectly good washer and nut? End of story.
TIP #137: Consolidating spare parts inventory into fewer
locations can reduce the overall amount of inventory
carried without having a negative impact on customer
service.
As we discussed with consolidating ﬁnished goods, you should also
consider consolidating spare parts used by ﬁeld service, facilities manage-
ment, and maintenance. You may ﬁnd that all three are using common
parts. Consolidation into one inventory location will make it easier to
control inventory and keep it more accurate. You may also achieve savings
in storage space and safety stock inventory. Moving goods around the
world has dramatically improved over the years, and storing goods close
to airport hubs may not be necessary. You must be careful that consoli-
dation of inventory doesn’t have a negative impact on customer service.
Of course, if you can eliminate the part from your product, there would
be no need to keep the part in inventory at all, would there?

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

TIP #138: Field service may share resources with other links
in your supply chain. By combining resources you may be
able to save money and improve operating efﬁciency.
TIP #137 spoke about combining the inventory of diverse supply-chain
links. This TIP addresses combining the actual personnel who perform
these functions. Consider the following:

If it makes good business sense that they be part of the same
supply-chain link, by all means do so. This might work with a
small company, but a large company may have trouble implement-
ing this.

If not part of the same supply-chain link, you can still combine
their collective knowledge. After all, all three links have at least
one thing in common (even if inventory is not common); they ﬁx
things.

Get them together for a meeting at least once a quarter to discuss
such things as new product design, and product enhancements
and redesign.

At the very least, make them aware of your inventory rightsizing
efforts and ask them what they can do to help make it happen.
TIP #139: Individual performance measures (related to
inventory) should be replaced by shared, team-based per-
formance measurements.
This TIP will require a great deal of interaction among the supply-
chain links. While some links will still require metrics unique to their area
of responsibility, inventory can be a shared metric if expectations are
properly communicated. For example, inventory turns are a very typical
company performance metric, but so many groups have an impact on
inventory turns that it is not reasonable to assign this metric to one link
in your supply chain. Inventory turns are impacted by:

Manufacturing: cycle times

Purchasing: material lead times

Sales and marketing: selling the product

Process design: cycle times

Planning: safety stock levels
I have mentioned only a few links and only one example for each.
There are more. Inventory turns (or days on hand) are a metric that should

390

Rightsizing Inventory
be shared by the entire supply chain. The same is true for levels of
inventory; this is a shared metric, also.
TIP #140: Education and training have to be an important
part of your inventory rightsizing effort.
A formal training and education are a “must do” in today’s competitive
world. Even if your company has only ten people, you must plan ahead
and put together an education program that will allow your employees
to keep their skills up to date and give your company a competitive edge
in your marketplace. Don’t leave this important area up to the individual
links to implement. It must be companywide. The individual links will
certainly have a great deal of input as to course content and who the
instructor should be — but the overall program must be coordinated.

Put together a matrix of supply-chain links by position/title/job
description and then put together a list of the types of courses
needed.

Match the job position to the course program for each person.

Meet with the individuals and discuss the educational opportunities
available.

Identify courses necessary for career advancement.

Agree on an education strategy, individual by individual.

Keep employee personnel records up to date.

Recognize employee achievement with a certiﬁcate or other means
of communicating their accomplishments.
The inventory type of education will vary company by company. For
some people it may be a two-hour video, and for others it may be a two-
week workshop off-site.
TIP #141: Human resources can take a proactive role in
your inventory rightsizing effort by raising the visibility
of the inventory effort through formal company commu-
nication channels.
There are several ways this TIP can be accomplished:
1.
The highest-ranking executive in the company can put out a
monthly e-mail to all employees regarding the activities related to
inventory.

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

391
2.
For employees without access to e-mail, I have seen companies
put a typed memo (from the same executive) in paycheck
envelopes.
3.
It can be posted on the company bulletin boards located in
lunchrooms, plant ﬂoor, etc.
4.
A company newsletter can be used as an effective communication
vehicle, as described in this chapter.
Regardless of the media used, the important point is if you are going
to make inventory rightsizing as a new way of life for the company, you
must raise the visibility so that all employees are aware of what is going on.
TIP #142: Get your maintenance team involved in per-
forming proactive maintenance. This will greatly enhance
your chances to rightsize your inventory.
You cannot manufacture or move inventory efﬁciently if your equip-
ment and machines constantly break down. Your maintenance team can
be a big asset in performing preventive maintenance. But if you really
want to improve productivity, get your maintenance team involved in a
proactive maintenance program.

Pick a machine or work area where efﬁciency is not good; in all
probability it will be a bottleneck work center, but it doesn’t have
to be.

Assign routine maintenance to machine operators so that your
maintenance team is freed up to focus on improving machine
efﬁciency.

Make proactive maintenance a formal program.

Assign team members to work with maintenance.

Benchmark current machine performance.

Set new performance metrics.

Have scheduled meetings with management to discuss ideas,
progress, and obstacles that need to be overcome.

If possible, ask your equipment/machine provider if he or she has
another user who has improved the efﬁciency of the equipment,
and if so, ask to visit them.
TIP #143: Maintenance personnel should be part of a
cross-functional team committed to reducing machine
setup times.

392

Rightsizing Inventory
Reducing setup times will be part of your proactive maintenance
program, discussed in TIP #142. It is not the responsibility of maintenance
alone; the operators who run the machines every day will have a lot of
input into the process. After all, who knows the operation better?

Get the machine operator involved.

Form a team: machine operators, product design, process design,
manufacturing, facilities management, and ﬁeld service.

Ask your parts supplier to look at your machine setup process;
maybe he or she can do something to the part to shorten or
eliminate the need for the setup.

Have your end customers view your setup process; they might
offer suggestions.

Make a video of the current setup.

Time the current setup from beginning to end.

Locate tools within easy access to the setup person.

Make as much of the new setup “external setup” (done while the
machine is still running the current part).
TIP #144: Reducing machine setup times will increase
capacity, reduce lead times, and decrease lot sizes, which
could ultimately lead to increased sales and proﬁts for the
company.
One of the biggest opportunities to rightsize your inventory is to reduce
your machine setup times. It may also be your biggest challenge. The
beneﬁts are well worth the effort (particularly if your setup times are
hours, not minutes):

Increased capacity: Machine is not sitting idle, it is making product.

Smaller lot sizes: If a setup takes minutes rather than hours, you
will be inclined to make less at one time.

Shorter lead times: Overall manufacturing lead time will be reduced
by the amount of setup time saved, and because of the shorter
lead times.

Increased (improved) ﬂexibility: Perhaps the greatest beneﬁt of
all is you will be able to respond to changes in customer require-
ments faster.
TIP #145: Get facilities management involved in your
“good housekeeping” activities. It can contribute to the
improved visibility of inventory, which is an important
criterion in your inventory rightsizing efforts.

The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Management

393
Depending on the size of your company, facilities management may
or may not be involved with the storage of inventory. In large companies
(>500 employees) it probably has its hands full just keeping the facility
running. However, in smaller companies (<100 employees) I have seen
facilities management very involved with inventory storage — from keep-
ing the aisles free and clear of debris to the erection of shelving to store
inventory. It is the latter I refer to here.
Good housekeeping is everyone’s responsibility, but facilities manage-
ment can play a big role in making it happen:
1.
Create a good housekeeping team made up of people from man-
ufacturing, plant engineering, and maintenance.
2.
Schedule facility “walks” where the team walks the facility on a
predetermined schedule.
3.
Write down any violation of company storage policies.
4.
Make a note of any area that needs good housekeeping.
5.
Document and publish ﬁndings to responsible groups.
6.
Develop an action plan to correct the situation.
7.
Follow up to ensure the activity has been completed; do this at
least once a month.
TIP #146: Don’t focus your efforts on ﬁnding new space
to put inventory. Focus your efforts on better utilization
of the space you already have. Better yet, get rid of your
inventory so you don’t need the space.
I have always found this to be an interesting phenomenon. There
seems to be an unwritten rule that says “The more space you have, the
more space you will use to store inventory.” My suggestion here is simple.
Rather than spend all that energy and time trying to ﬁgure out how to
get more space or use the space you have more efﬁciently, spend that
time and energy on ﬁguring out how to eliminate the need for the space.
You may ﬁnd that the root cause of the problem is not lack of space but
too much inventory.
TIP #147: Facilities management can help protect inven-
tory from being damaged during storage and internal
movement through your supply chain.
There is nothing more wasteful than to make a product, store it on a
shelf, and have it become damaged just sitting there. You bought the raw
material, paid for the labor to transform it into a ﬁnished product, and
now it is useless. The example I used in the Woodstock story is real. I
have seen goods get damaged by rain coming in through a leaky roof.

394

Rightsizing Inventory

Keep inventory off the ﬂoor; put it on a shelf or skid if possible.

Don’t keep inventory unprotected in a high trafﬁc area where there
is a lot of movement going on: forklift trucks, hand trucks, etc.

Allow enough space in the aisles for material handling.

Train personnel in the proper handling and storage of goods.

When the weather is a concern, cover inventory with a protective
wrapping such as a tarp or shrink wrap.
I have entitled this chapter “The Unsung Heroes of Inventory Manage-
ment,” because I believe they truly are. When we think of supply-chain
management, we typically think of manufacturing, distribution, product
design, and so forth. But a supply chain is much more than that. It is
people, machines, and facilities. All links in your supply chain can have
a positive effect on your inventory rightsizing efforts. Let’s not forget these
four important links. Table 10.1 represents the current status of the
Woodstock inventory. Table 10.2 indicates Woodstock work-in-process
inventory turns based on the estimated annual cost of goods sold (COGS).

Rightsizing Inventory: 
A New Way of Life for the 
Supply Chain
Harmony Team Meeting: November 30
Woodstock Inventory: $31 Million
My name is Jack and I am supply chain manager for Woodstock
Lighting Group.
I’ve only been here 11 months but it seems like 11 years. This has been the
most challenging assignment I’ve ever had, but in many ways it has been
a satisfying year. I’ve met a lot of nice, bright people, and truly believe we
have made great strides in our inventory rightsizing efforts. We’re not quite
there yet, but it is happening. I’m glad Joe is gone. He was a difﬁcult guy
to work for and we had many philosophical differences about how things
should be done. I like Arnie. He is open-minded and willing to listen to
new ideas and new ways of doing things.
When Joe left I thought they would put me in charge of the Harmony
Team, but I’m glad they didn’t. Orlando was the right choice. He has been
here for 15 years and knows this place inside and out. He and Arnie work
well together. In the ﬁve months since he was made the team leader, we
have made far more progress than we would have with Joe challenging
every step we took.

398

Rightsizing Inventory
My wife thinks I’m crazy. I was offered far more money by another
company, but the job didn’t seem challenging enough for me. It was well
on its way to becoming a world-class company, and I would have been
bored within six months. Woodstock had (has) so many problems that we
have nowhere to go but up. Every day there is a new surprise, offering a
new challenge. I like that. I also like the idea that Adriana is involved and
committed to rightsizing our inventory. People are constantly asking me:
“Did Joe quit or did he get ﬁred?” The truth is I don’t know and I don’t
care. All I know is that I have a job to do, and I truly believe I can continue
to help the company rightsize our inventory.
Rightsizing inventory isn’t something you focus on for six months and
then move on to something else. As the year is coming to a close, we
have reduced inventory by almost $10 million. But if we pat ourselves
on our backs and say “A job well done” and move on to another focus,
we will only be kidding ourselves. This effort is not a project. We will
never ﬁnish rightsizing our inventory. There will always be something we
can do to improve our inventory position. In reality, it has to become a
new way of life for us. We have to create and sustain a new company
culture committed to continuous improvement. Too many companies have
ineffective supply chains because they fall prey to what I call “the ten

Ten Most Common Mistakes of Rightsizing Inventory
1.
Treating inventory rightsizing as a project. We have never
called our inventory rightsizing effort “a project.” The term project
implies a speciﬁc unit of work or task to be accomplished with a
speciﬁc start date and end date. This effort is ongoing and will
never end until our inventory is rightsized perfectly — which it
never will be. If we set a goal and obtain it, does that mean it’s
over? No, we will continuously work at reducing inventory and
placing it in the right location in our supply chain. Keep in mind
that the right level of inventory and the right location of inventory
is not a stagnant condition. It will change over time as our business
environment and strategies change. The right location of inventory
today may not be the right location of inventory tomorrow.
Too often I have seen a company set a goal for the year and
achieve it, only to move on to another project. When that happens,
inventory often gets out of control and the old situation repeats
itself. This is also true when a key employee (often the knowledge
expert or champion) leaves the company. “Business as usual” sets
in and the project gets shelved. We can’t let that happen here.
Joe’s leaving is a good example. Despite what you thought of Joe,
he was our leader and was driving this effort. As soon as he left,
Adriana named Orlando as our new Harmony Team leader. This
was Adriana’s way of telling us that this is an important part of
our company strategy, and the effort would be ongoing.
2.
Focusing only on inventory reduction. Don’t get me wrong: In
most cases reducing inventory is a great thing to do. But the status
and location of inventory in the supply chain is also important. By
status, I mean whether it is in raw material, work-in-process, or
ﬁnished goods. For example, having ﬁnished goods inventory in
the Beacon Lights Division is not the right inventory status for a
division with an engineer-to-order or make-to-order strategy (unless,
of course, we are referring to replacement parts and spare parts).
By location, I mean the physical location of the inventory. At which
supply chain link does the inventory reside: storeroom, manufac-
turing, product design, ﬁeld service, or distribution center?
There are going to be times when we will want to increase
inventory rather than decrease it. The Flashlight Division is a good
example of this. Until we can get our total lead time to be less
than our customer delivery lead time, we have to stock ﬂashlights
in ﬁnished goods inventory (which we now do). For ﬂashlight
#030273 we have experienced far too many stockouts. In order to
reduce the number of stockouts and increase customer service,

400

Rightsizing Inventory
sales has requested that we increase the amount of safety stock
we carry, thus increasing the level of inventory stocked on this
part. Although we are not pleased with the idea of increasing
inventory, it is difﬁcult to argue the point as our lead time to make
the ﬂashlight is far greater than our customer delivery lead time.
3.
Inaccurate BILL of Integrity (BOI). It will be difﬁcult to rightsize
our inventory if the data we are working with is inaccurate. The
BILL of Integrity discussed earlier focuses on the accuracy of the
bill of material, perpetual inventory records, lead times, and lot
size rules. If any of these four critical areas has inaccurate data,
the chances of rightsizing inventory will be challenging. Data
accuracy approaching 100 percent is necessary so that we can be
comfortable with the data we are working with. As we all know,
we have a long way to go here, but we are improving every day.
The BILL of Integrity isn’t the responsibility of any single link
in our supply chain. It is the responsibility of our entire supply
chain. For example, even though product design is responsible for
developing the BOI, it is the responsibility of manufacturing to
pick the right parts indicated in the BOI, and if any change is
made in the BOI, it must be approved and changed through an
engineering change notice procedure.
4.
Not getting all supply-chain links involved. This is a very
common mistake that companies make. You have heard from our
“unsung heroes,” and as you now know, they have a lot to
contribute to our inventory rightsizing efforts. We must keep them
involved. We must take the philosophy that all our employees can
contribute — if only we would ask them. In order for them to
help, they must understand what we are trying to accomplish.
Every supply-chain manager must communicate with their team to
ensure that this happens.
5.
Not having shared performance measures. You have heard
about the conﬂicting objectives that drive each of our supply-chain
links. It is human nature that people will be motivated to attain
the goals and objectives their job performance is measured by. For
example, if manufacturing is measured on production output, it
stands to reason it will want a steady ﬂow of raw materials available
so that it doesn’t have machines sitting idle waiting for material.
On long-lead-time machine setups they will want to run the largest
lot (batch) possible so that they can obtain favorable production
efﬁciencies. This may create high levels of raw material, WIP, and
ﬁnished goods. Purchasing may be measured by having a favorable
purchase price variance. This may lead to purchasing larger than
needed lot sizes so that they can achieve their performance objec-

Rightsizing Inventory: A New Way of Life for the Supply Chain

401
tives. The result will be higher levels of raw materials than is
needed for the foreseeable future.
The objectives of manufacturing and purchasing may be in conﬂict
with planning, whose performance measurement may be to
decrease inventory levels. Our management team has reviewed the
current performance measurements of each link in our supply
chain and is in the process of moving to shared performance
measurements across supply-chain links. Rightsizing our inventory
is one performance measurement we are going to use for our
entire supply chain.
6.
Assigning inventory responsibility to one person. Unless you
are an extremely small company, it is almost impossible to hold
one person (or one supply-chain link) responsible for rightsizing
inventory. There are too many functions and activities that are
outside of their control. Take our company as an example. As vice
president of operations, Joe was responsible for managing inven-
tory. But when he built inventory to meet the forecast, and sales
didn’t make its numbers, should operations be held accountable?
What happens when a key supplier doesn’t deliver on time and
production is late making inventory for orders? Whose fault is that?
Based on my experience, it is a waste of time to try to blame some
supply-chain link because inventory isn’t rightsized. Inventory is
everyone’s responsibility and the inventory rightsizing performance
metrics should be shared.
7.
Implementing technology without having a sound inventory
management foundation: We learned our lesson on this one the
hard way. When MRP was initially implemented here at Woodstock,
we didn’t have a solid inventory management foundation in place.
Our BILL of Integrity was very inaccurate. All we were doing was
throwing technology at the problem in the hopes that it would
solve our problems. Well, it didn’t. All we did was process inac-
curate information faster, so that we could make more mistakes
faster than we did before. As you’ve heard, we had people taking
materials out of the storeroom without the proper authorization.
Worse than that, they were not reporting what they took. All these
problems are a symptom of a poor inventory management foun-
dation. We are in the process of developing sound operating
policies and procedures so that the technology we have can be
used more effectively.
8.
Management not committed and involved. We can’t say that
we have that problem. I have been in many companies where the
company president told me he or she was committed to rightsizing
inventory. The company demonstrated its commitment by showing

402

Rightsizing Inventory
me a letter it sent out to all employees, saying the company was
committed to an inventory project of some sort or the other. Then
I would go out on the ﬂoor and ask workers if they were aware
of the company’s project and the president’s letter. More often than
not, they were not aware of any such program or project. The
word had not reached them. This was some commitment!
There is a difference between being committed and being involved.
Sending out a letter to all employees and establishing inventory
goals and objectives may seem like a commitment — and maybe
it is. But management must follow up the commitment by becoming
involved in the effort. By involved I mean attending meetings,
asking questions, providing resources, and in general being very
visible and available to the team.
9.
Lack of education or training: How can you tell someone to do
something, set goals, and hold them accountable without providing
them with the tools to do the job right? Education is an important
tool to be used in our inventory rightsizing efforts. For example,
lean manufacturing is a major philosophy that we are trying to
implement here that, if successful, will contribute much to our
inventory rightsizing effort. It would be impossible to achieve this
goal without educating the work force on what it is and how you
go about achieving a lean environment. Not everyone needs the
same level of education. Aimee is working with all our supply-
chain managers on developing an education and training program
that is right for everyone. Education on rightsizing our inventory
will be available to all employees to some degree or another.
10.
Not understanding the role of all your supply-chain links:
There is an old saying, “for every action there is a reaction.” This
applies to decisions we made about inventory. When one link in
the supply chain makes an inventory decision, that decision can
also impact other links in the supply chain — and not always
favorably. For example, if the company decides to move to an
inventory pull system, not only does that decision impact the
upstream and downstream work centers, it also has an impact on
purchasing, distribution, planning, and sales.
Before an inventory decision is implemented, you need to understand
what that impact is. You may ﬁnd that you are just pushing your inventory
problem onto another link in the supply chain and may make the problem
worse. The Harmony Team is taking the right approach here. We are
addressing this issue by meeting with all our supply-chain links so that
we can better understand their role and responsibility related to managing

Rightsizing Inventory: A New Way of Life for the Supply Chain

403
inventory. Once we understand everyone’s role, we will be able to see
the impact of inventory decisions on our entire supply chain.
How to Avoid the Ten Most Common Mistakes
1.
Treating inventory rightsizing as a project. I remember the
time I went to my doctor and he very politely told me that I should
lose weight. He said, “It took you a long time to put the weight
on and it will take you a long time to take it off. It will require a
change in your lifestyle (eating habits). Don’t look for a quick ﬁx
or the latest fad diet.” The same is true with rightsizing your
inventory. There is no quick ﬁx. It will require a change in company
culture. Here are some thoughts to consider:

Find a champion in the company who believes in rightsizing
inventory. We are lucky here; we have Arnie and Orlando who
really believe we can make it happen.

Get the commitment and involvement of the highest executive
possible. As you know, Adriana is leading this effort — you
might say she is another champion.

Put someone in charge who understands your supply chain.
First we had Arnie, and now we have Orlando. Both of them
know our supply chain really well.

Set milestones (with dates), but don’t set a ﬁnal inventory goal.
We have set a milestone for the year and will set a new
milestone for next year. How low can we get is anybody’s guess.

Never, ever use the word “project” when referring to your
rightsizing effort. I don’t believe I have ever heard anyone here
at Woodstock refer to inventory rightsizing as a project.

When a key person on the team leaves the company or gets
promoted, replace him or her immediately. We did this when
Arnie got promoted to vice president of operations; Orlando
replaced him on the ﬁrst day.

Make inventory rightsizing a key company strategy every ﬁscal
year. Adriana has made inventory rightsizing a big part of our
company strategy, and she is committed to doing so every year.

Give the effort visibility throughout your entire supply chain.
We are doing an excellent job on this point. I’ve been told by
longtime employees that communication has never been better,
and every day there is some form of communication about
inventory rightsizing.

404

Rightsizing Inventory
2.
Focusing only on inventory reduction. Reduction of inventory
is a beneﬁt of rightsizing your inventory. For example, if you focus
on lean manufacturing concepts, setup reduction, and an inventory
pull philosophy (and do them right), the result will be a reduction
in inventory. Doing all the things discussed by the Harmony Team
will result in a reduction in inventory.

Make sure your inventory strategy matches your business strat-
egy. When we started this year our inventory strategy and
business strategy didn’t match. They still don’t — but they are
a lot closer.

Make sure your inventory strategy matches your customer’s
inventory strategy. We have a lot to learn here. We have to
keep asking our customers questions and respond to their
answers by showing them we can match their strategy.

Focus your efforts on using the tools, techniques, and philos-
ophies (as discussed in these meetings). There are so many
great tools, techniques, and technologies available to us. We
just have to be careful and make sure the proper business
processes are in place before we do use them.

Put a sound inventory management foundation in place and
follow it. As you are aware, every time you decide to implement
something new, you need to make sure you have the proper
procedures in place.
3.
Inaccurate BOI. You are going to make inventory rightsizing
decisions based on the data and information available to you. If
it is inaccurate, you are going to make the wrong decisions. Your
information must be accurate. We are addressing all four points
of our BOI. It is a slow and tedious process, but we are well on
our way.

Set high goals of accuracy for BOIs, lead time, lot sizes, and
inventory. Our goal is 100 percent accuracy for all four elements.

Make everyone aware of the accuracy goals. We communicate
the current status of all links every week and publish it.

Put procedures in place to correct errors. This is the key to
improving our record accuracy. Fixing an error in a record is
a good thing, but the key is to ﬁnd and ﬁx the root cause of
the error so it doesn’t happen again.

Implement a cycle-counting program. We are now cycle counting,
and ﬁnding many mistakes that we are ﬁxing almost every day.

Constantly review and update your purchasing and manufac-
turing lead times. We have a policy in place to govern how
often lead times will be updated.


405

Constantly review and update your lot-size rules. We are build-
ing a table of lot-size rules for varying business scenarios.

Follow formal ECNs for BOI changes. We didn’t always do this,
and it caused us many problems. We now have a good handle
on it and have educated everyone to follow the ECN procedures.
4.
Not getting all supply-chain links involved. All supply-chain
links can contribute to your inventory rightsizing efforts. Most
companies leave inventory management up to the typical supply-
chain links such as manufacturing, distribution, purchasing, and
planning. As discussed in all these meetings, everyone has a role
to play that can help with the team effort:

Don’t wait for people to volunteer; ask them to get involved.
We have taken an aggressive approach on this and have sched-
uled formal meetings with all supply-chain links.

Make a formal list of all supply-chain links and methodically
speak with them all. We have done this even with the sublinks.
By that I mean we have met with such sublinks as the shipping
and receiving folks (sublinks of distribution), as well as the
supply-chain manager for distribution.

Provide feedback on the status of the team effort and ask for
ideas and suggestions. Every month we inform all supply-chain
managers of the status of the inventory rightsizing effort (by e-
mail) and ask that they share the results with their team. We
also stress that we have an open door policy, and all questions
and ideas are welcomed and encouraged. I can’t tell you the
number of people who have stopped by and given us some
new ideas the team hadn’t even thought of.

Recognize people for their contribution to the effort. It will
be an incentive for others to get involved. We don’t give out
monetary rewards (we can’t afford it), but we do recognize
people for outstanding contributions to the effort by publish-
ing their name in the company newsletter, and they also
receive a personal note from Adriana commending them on
their effort.

Don’t forget to involve the “unsung heroes” as we discussed in
our last meeting. Their contributions have been a pleasant
surprise and addition to our inventory rightsizing efforts.
5.
Not having shared performance measurements. One way of
getting everyone involved (common mistake #4) is for all supply-
chain links to have the same performance measures related to
rightsizing inventory. All employees are evaluated on how well (or
poorly) they do their job. Some companies have formal review

406

Rightsizing Inventory
processes, and some do it informally. Regardless, consider the
following:

Review all job descriptions and job performance measurements
to make sure there are no conﬂicting objectives that will harm
your inventory rightsizing efforts. Aimee is working with the
supply-chain managers on this; they report that they are making
good progress.

Recognize that some conﬂicting objectives will remain in order
to have the proper “checks and balances” in place. For example,
ﬁnance will continue to want inventory reduction across the
board, and sales will continue to want high levels of customer
service. Somewhere in between is the “right” balance of inven-
tory for the company to maintain.

Make some aspect of inventory management part of everyone’s
job description; whether it is simply an operator putting tools
back at the end of the shift or human resources (HR) developing
an “inventory” of education classes.
6.
Assigning inventory responsibility to only one person (or
link). No single link in your supply chain can rightsize inventory
by itself. Sure, it can exert some control of the inventory it is
responsible for: distribution for ﬁnished goods and manufacturing
for work-in-process (WIP). But rightsizing inventory is such an
integrated process that even the inventory these links control will
be subject to the inventory policies controlled by the other links.

Identify those links that control the largest portion of your
inventory and make them part of your “Harmony Team.” As
there can only be a limited number of people on the team,
these “power” links will have the greatest impact.

Bring the “power” links together with the other links in your
supply chain on an as-needed basis and as often as reasonable.
There isn’t a day that goes by when we are not working with
one link or another. Rightsizing inventory cannot be done in a
vacuum by only one or two links in the supply chain.

Select a team leader who is most knowledgeable about your
entire supply chain. First we had Arnie, and now we have
Orlando, two people who know our supply chain inside and out.

The team leader must meet the criteria of leadership discussed
in Chapter 1.

Assign shared inventory performance measures to the team.
7.
Implementing technology without having a sound inventory
management foundation. It makes no sense to implement new
technology without having a solid procedure in place. Continuing
to do things the “same old way” and expecting different results

Rightsizing Inventory: A New Way of Life for the Supply Chain

407
just because you are using new technology to do it will be an
expensive experience.

Develop process ﬂow maps of the current process. We have
changed many of our processes and procedures on how we
handle the physical inventory and informational transactions.

Redesign the process ﬂow to make it more efﬁcient and accurate.

Make sure everyone understands their role in the new process.
The best way to accomplish this is by open communications,
which we are getting better at every day.

Provide education (why) and training (how) on the new
technology.

Conduct a pilot run with the new system. Every time we change
a process or procedure, we do so in a pilot environment. Only
when we are satisﬁed that it works (and is an improvement)
do we implement it into our business model.

Remove the bugs and ﬁx the process as needed.
8.
Management not committed and involved. You cannot be com-
mitted if you are not involved. Management involvement takes
many forms:

Attendance at inventory rightsizing meetings. Adriana has
attended many of our Harmony Team meetings and has been
an active participant.

Formal communications with all employees about the status of
the rightsizing effort: e-mails, newsletters, videos, bulletin board
notices, etc.

Employee recognition for outstanding contribution to the right-
sizing effort.

Ensuring that rightsizing inventory is part of the company
strategy and business plan.

Communicating with customers and suppliers on inventory-
related topics.

Ensuring that all supply-chain links are involved in the effort.

Providing the tools, resources, and education programs neces-
sary to get the job done.

Remove barriers to success. I don’t know the reason Joe is no
longer with the company, but I do know there were times he
was more of a hindrance than a help. It is a sad, but not
uncommon, commentary when the top executive driving the
inventory rightsizing effort is considered a barrier to its success.
9.
Lack of education and training. Typically one of the ﬁrst budgets
cut during hard times is the education budget. This is when you
probably need it the most. You cannot afford to neglect employee
education; especially today with constant change taking place on

408

Rightsizing Inventory
what seems like a daily basis. The supply chains that are current
with the latest techniques and technologies will stand a better
chance of surviving than those that are not.

Provide some form of education and training to all employees,
even if it’s a 15-minute video on setup reduction or the concepts
of lean manufacturing.

Have your knowledge experts recommend classes and qualiﬁed
instructors.

Work with HR to ensure that everyone gets educated.

Make education part of each employee’s career path.

Attend conferences on topics related to inventory management,
especially if the speaker works for a competitor.

Join professional societies and organizations.
10.
Not understanding the role of all your supply-chain links.
You cannot make intelligent inventory rightsizing decisions without
understanding how that decision will impact the other links in your
supply chain.

Schedule time with the other links in your supply chain to learn
what they do and how they do it, similar to the approach we
are taking at Woodstock.

Visit each area to see the operation ﬁrsthand (a picture is worth
a thousand words).

Ask them what their inventory-related problems are.

Ask them what the team can do to make the operation more
efﬁcient.

If practical, get formal education on the topics related to their
links.

Communicate with other links as much as possible (and rea-
sonable).
Sustaining the Inventory Rightsizing Effort
Woodstock has made good progress in their effort to rightsize our inven-
tory. But we can’t stop at the end of this year. The effort must continue
as a new way of life for the company if we want to survive and prosper.
Although we still have a long way to go, we can consider the achievements
thus far as the glass being half full rather than half empty. After all, we
didn’t have to lay off any employees (I don’t like the word “downsize”),
which is a good thing.
TIP #149: To successfully rightsize inventory, the effort
must be sustained indeﬁnitely on a continuous basis.

Rightsizing Inventory: A New Way of Life for the Supply Chain

409
Maintain Inventory Visibility throughout the Supply Chain
Without constant diligence our inventory rightsizing effort will lose
momentum over time. To avoid this happening, we must establish an
inventory awareness program. This can take many forms. The written
word is a powerful reinforcement tool if used effectively. Post the numer-
ical goals and objectives all over the facility: in ofﬁces, on bulletin boards,
e-mails, etc. Update the status often using graphic forms like bar charts
and line charts. Continuously recognize employees for outstanding deeds
and achievements. This will improve morale and will be an incentive for
others to get involved. If we have a bad month and inventory gets out
of line, explain what happened without putting the blame on anybody
(or any link). From the boardroom to the shipping dock, make everyone
aware of the status of our inventory rightsizing efforts.
Make Rightsizing Inventory an Important Part of Your Business 
Plan and Strategy
Every company has a business plan, whether it is a formal written document
or a plan of action in the mind of the company owner. A typical business
plan is usually a high-level document that speaks in terms of dollars and
percentages. As inventory is such a high cost to the company, I don’t see
how we can avoid having an inventory strategy as part of our business
plan. Earlier we spoke of using inventory as a strategic advantage to gain
a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The inventory goals for each
year should be spelled out in our business plan, and the inventory goals
should be carefully watched and updated to reﬂect the current market
conditions relative to the current status of your inventory.
Look to Achieve Small Incremental Successes
It probably took us a long time to get our inventory out of balance, and
it may take us a long time to get it rightsized. Look to achieve a small
incremental success. I have found the best place to start is to “pick the
low-hanging fruit.” By that I mean, look to reduce inventory of slow-
moving, obsolete items. Run an inventory aging report for all items with
no activity (transactions) for 12 months or more. If we haven’t used an
item for a year, there is a good chance we don’t need it. It is costing us
money to carry in stock and taking up valuable space that can be best
used for other activities.
If we do this, make sure the item can’t be substituted for an active
item. We will want to run a “where used” report to see if the material

410

Rightsizing Inventory
can be used elsewhere (in another product), assuming it is a raw material
or subassembly. You will probably have to get design engineering
involved, and ﬁnance needs to be aware if you are writing the item off
your ﬁnancial documents. This can be a tedious process but well worth
the effort.
Remove Obstacles and Roadblocks
Part of management’s commitment and involvement is to remove obstacles
and roadblocks that get in the way of your inventory rightsizing efforts.
It could be as easy as providing the right tools to do the job, or as difﬁcult
as removing someone from the supply chain who has a negative inﬂuence
on the team. Management’s biggest challenge will be to lead the company’s
culture change from one of negative thinking to positive thinking. State-
ments like “That won’t work here,” or “We can’t do that because …”
should be replaced with thoughts like: “Let’s try it to see if it works.”
Company Culture and Inventory
TIP #150: A strong, healthy company culture will be an
asset to rightsizing your inventory. A weak, sick company
culture will be a liability to rightsizing your inventory.
Top management sets the tone of the company culture by the way it
acts and conducts business. New people coming into the company will
adapt to the current culture as a way of survival. It is rare that a newcomer
can buck “the system” and change the culture, unless he or she is coming
into the company at a very high executive level. Even then it will be a
challenge; people will want to test the boss. Unfortunately, it can take a
company crisis, like the one of survival that Woodstock is facing, for a
company to change. It is a good thing that Adriana recognizes that change
is needed and has inserted herself as the change agent, leading the way.
Unfortunately, Joe didn’t share Adriana’s sense of urgency and fought the
culture change all the way.
Adriana has raised the visibility of the importance of rightsizing inven-
tory and thus a culture change is under way. She recognizes that it won’t
happen overnight and has made it part of the company’s annual business
plan and strategy for this year and the years to come. The fragmented
subcultures that existed at Woodstock are being replaced by one united
culture, led by a management team that is knowledgeable and well
respected by the employees. Had Joe stayed with the company, I’m not

Rightsizing Inventory: A New Way of Life for the Supply Chain

411
sure the culture change would have taken place as rapidly as it has.
Company culture change can be driven by:

Management’s recognizing that the culture must change and setting
a good example by:

Changing company policies and procedures to support culture
change

Establishing performance metrics that support a change in culture

Recognizing employees who contribute to the change in culture

Hiring new managers and employees who have the cultural values
to change things

Culture change must be inherent in the company business plan
and strategy

Creating constant awareness of the new culture by communicating
with all employees to reinforce the culture change

Reinforcing the new culture by making it part of a formal company
(education) orientation program

Creating and publishing a company “value statement” or
credo/motto that will become the new standard of excellence by
which the company does business
Although I have spoken about culture change in generic terms, the
application of the suggestions made will enhance your opportunities to
rightsize your inventory. Your company president has to take the ﬁrst step
and recognize that change is needed.
Inventory and the Formal Versus Informal System
I have always found it fascinating how the informal system works in
companies, regardless of the company size. If I didn’t see this for myself,
I wouldn’t have believed it. Here is how it works: You have quoted a
standard lead time of six weeks on all new incoming orders. The owner
of the company plays golf with a customer who is also a personal friend.
That customer has a problem with one of his customers and asks your
president (owner) to help him out. Now, since this customer is a friend
of the owner, he sells your product at cost to his friend.
The president bypasses the sales department and personally walks the
handwritten order into the order entry department and says it is a rush
and must be shipped as soon as possible. No one questions the edict;
after all he owns the company and can do what he wants. He is also the
guy who signs your paycheck. The order is shipped in less than 24 hours.

Rightsizing Inventory
Remember, I started out by saying the lead time for this item was six
weeks! That’s some friend. Here is what happened:

A production run was stopped on an existing WIP order and two
new machine setups had to be done.

Raw material purchased for another order was “borrowed” so that
the rush order could be made.

No one in purchasing was advised that the material was no longer
available.

It was found out later that the material consumed had a lead time
of four weeks to replace, and it was needed next week. Subse-
quently, the customer cancelled the order and bought it from our
competitor.

The purchase price on the replacement inventory was increased
by the supplier.

Production had to work overtime to get the rush order ﬁnished
(at time and a half).

Because of the overtime, extra utility costs were incurred.

The product that was in WIP (and taken off the machines) was
reported as being late (to the system) and placed on an expedite
list for planning to follow up.

Shipping had to work overtime to pack up the ﬁnished product.

Shipping had to take the shipment (drive) to the trucking ﬁrm
because the last pick up of the day was missed.

The company had to pay a freight premium to expedite the
shipment.

Capacity used to make up the rush order can never be recovered
and was lost forever.

The WIP order taken off the machines was actually late, and the
customer cancelled the order. It was a very proﬁtable order, too.

That same customer cancelled two other orders he had with us
and went to a competitor.
I ﬁgure they lost about $50,000 on this order and also lost two
proﬁtable customers in less than 24 hours. But, hey, the boss’s golﬁng
buddy was happy. I’m exaggerating a little — but not that much. This
is, or can be, the informal system working at its worst. There will always
be rush orders — that’s the nature of supply and demand. Even then,
formal procedures should be followed. I’m not saying the new order
has to get at the end of the line, but I am saying that formal procedures
should be followed.
The order should have been entered properly, and all links impacted
by the decision should have been notiﬁed. It wouldn’t have prevented

all of the things that happened, but it would have prevented some of
them. Right from the beginning sales could have told the president about
the potential of losing two proﬁtable customers; if he had still insisted on
doing it, they all should have started looking for new jobs.
As the year comes to a close, our next meeting — and the last meeting
of the year — will literally be on the last day of our ﬁscal and calendar
year. On December 31, Adriana will address our Harmony Team and we
will have an audio hookup for part of the meeting so that all employees
will hear what she has to say.

From: Harmony Team
Subject: Rightsizing Inventory
Current Inventory: $31 Million
As the year comes to an end, our inventory rightsizing
effort is starting to bear fruit. Our inventory is down $9
million since the ﬁrst of the year and has been reposi-
tioned in our supply chain to reﬂect our company strat-
egy and plans. We have shipped over $88 million worth
of product year to date with one more month to go.
We will exceed last year’s sales ($90 million) and come
very close to our forecast for the year. Our ﬁnished
goods inventory has been reduced by almost $3 million,
and raw material has been reduced by $3.6 million. This
has been an outstanding accomplishment, and we
expect inventory to be reduced further by the end of
the year. Our supply-chain manager, Jack, addressed
the group this month and what follows is a summary
of the meeting. As usual, you will ﬁnd the latest version
of our inventory rightsizing model at the end of this e-
mail and the detailed minutes of the meeting will be
published shortly. Please share them with your team.
1.
Jack reviewed the ten most common mistakes com-
panies make when trying to rightsize their inventory:

Treating inventory rightsizing as a project

Focusing only on inventory reduction

Inaccurate “BILL of Integrity”

Not getting all supply-chain links involved

414

Rightsizing Inventory

Not having shared performance measures

Assigning inventory responsibility to one person

Implementing technology without having a sound
inventory management foundation

Management not committed or involved

Lack of education and training

Not understanding the role of all your supply-chain
links
2.
Jack also gave us his thoughts on how we could avoid
the ten most common mistakes. We will publish his
ideas in the minutes of the meeting.
3.
He stressed that we must sustain our inventory right-
sizing effort and in order for us to do so we must:

Maintain inventory (information) visibility through-
out the supply chain.

Make rightsizing inventory an important part of our
business plan and strategy.

Look to achieve small incremental successes.

Remove obstacles and roadblocks
4.
In order for us to sustain the inventory rightsizing
effort, our company culture must change as we con-
tinue to focus our strategy on this. He suggested nine
ideas on how we can go about this, the key of which
is management becoming a role model for change and
setting a good example for all employees to follow.
We have scheduled a meeting with Adriana on Decem-
ber 31, and you are all invited to attend. Adriana will
summarize our achievements for the year and will
present our inventory rightsizing model to all employ-
ees through a televised satellite hookup. Please plan
on attending this important meeting. Figure 11.1 is a
draft of our ﬁnal inventory rightsizing model and is an
attachment to this e-mail. We are in the process of
ﬁnalizing it. Again, we thank you for your ongoing sup-
port and commitment.

Applying the Tips, Tools, and Philosophies to 
Your Company
Throughout this book I have alluded to supply-chain links functioning as
silos that operate as entities unto themselves. In fact, the tag line of this
book is “Turning Inventory Silos into a Collaborative Supply Chain Net-
work.” By that I mean that a company has to change from a silo mentality
and function as an integrated whole. Changing the boxes on an organi-
zation chart isn’t going to do it. It will require a change in the company
culture. A company culture is a philosophy of how business is conducted
and the way things are done in the company. It has little to do with
policies and procedures. Basically, it is the way people act toward their
job and one another in the daily performance of their jobs. It is a set of
values that deﬁne the company.
TIP #148: Avoid the ten most common mistakes of right-
sizing your inventory.
Jack has done a good job of telling how we can avoid the ten most
common mistakes of rightsizing inventory. It would be redundant for me
to repeat them again. I will, however, add some of my own thoughts to
what Jack has suggested in this meeting.

Rightsizing Inventory

Good housekeeping is an essential part of any inventory right-
sizing effort. A messy and disorganized storeroom or warehouse
will contribute to the difﬁculty of managing inventory effectively.

Packing materials are an important part of your inventory right-
sizing effort. Lack of packing materials can quickly cause your
inventory to get out of balance. On the other hand, too much
packing material can add to the chaos of a poorly run warehouse
and cause you to miss counting inventory correctly.

Use inventory exception reports to take corrective action. You
don’t want to wade through lots of “green bar” reports or multiple
computer screens to ﬁnd the inventory exceptions that need to be
dealt with.

Safety stock should only be added to inventory to cover the
uncertainty of supply and demand; it should not be used to avoid
blame or make one link look good in the eyes of the other links.
Remember, if each link adds safety stock to its planned level of
inventory, it will grow proportionally and quickly get out of control.
By having excess inventory, problems can remain hidden and not
be addressed.

Treat A, B, and C inventory items separately. Don’t have one
arbitrary percentage goal of uniformly reducing and rightsizing
inventory across all items. Set different percentage/unit goals for
A’s, B’s, and C’s according to your business strategy of rightsizing
your inventory.
TIP #149: To successfully rightsize inventory the effort
must be sustained indeﬁnitely on a continuous basis.
You have heard me mention the term “continuous improvement”
throughout this book. Rightsizing inventory is not a “project-of-the-year.”
It has to become ingrained in the company culture. This will not happen
overnight. More than likely, it will be a series of small incremental steps
that will happen over many years. Some of your rightsizing improvements
will be dramatic, but more often than not — after you’ve picked the low-
hanging fruit — it will become a tedious process, taking one small step
at a time. Don’t be discouraged by the slow process. After all, it took you
a long time to get the inventory where it is today, and it will take you a
long time to get it where it should be.
While all this rightsizing is taking place you must never lose sight
of customer needs. As inventory is removed from your supply chain,
you must evaluate the impact on customer service. Sustaining an inven-
tory rightsizing effort over years is a difﬁcult task to achieve. But then

again, nothing good comes easy. You have probably heard of Murphy’s
law: “What can go wrong will go wrong.” Look at some of the obstacles
to overcome:

Money will become tight. Cash outﬂow will exceed cash inﬂow.
One of the best ways of improving cash ﬂow is to sell off your
inventory and reinvest your money (not in more inventory) in
technologies and techniques that will help you keep inventory
“rightsized” so it doesn’t happen again.

Key people will leave the company. Contrary to what an egotist will
tell you, no one person is indispensable. When a key person quits
(or gets ﬁred) replace him or her immediately (like Woodstock did).
Don’t let there be a time lag in your inventory rightsizing efforts.

Your company may be bought or you may buy another company.
If your company is sold, the new owners will expect you to
continue your inventory rightsizing efforts, or at least it is reason-
able to assume they would. If you buy another company, your
inventory rightsizing efforts will just expand to include the inven-
tory of the company you just purchased.

An act of nature could disrupt your business. This is never a good
thing, and the need to rightsize your inventory could be even
greater than it was before.

A key supplier could go out of business. You should never “put
all your eggs in one basket” as they say. I never really understood
that statement. I guess it means that if you drop the basket all the
eggs will break, and if the eggs were in multiple baskets, then you
wouldn’t lose them all. You should always have alternative sources
for purchased materials.

You may lose a key customer, or you may gain a large customer.
Losing a key customer or gaining a key customer will increase
your sense of urgency to rightsize your inventory.
As you can see, all these obstacles aren’t obstacles at all. They are
actually reasons you should work with a sense of urgency to rightsize
your inventory. Not having the “right” inventory could put you out of
business just as fast as having too much inventory. Every year your
business plan and strategy should include some element of rightsizing
your inventory, whether it is reducing inventory or repositioning the
inventory in your supply chain.
TIP #150: A strong, healthy company culture will be an
asset to rightsizing your inventory. A weak, sick company
culture will be a liability to rightsizing your inventory.

418

Rightsizing Inventory
If executive management takes a laissez faire attitude toward managing
inventory, so will the rest of the supply chain. It always starts at the top.
If management doesn’t care, why should the employees? Why not buy
and make as much inventory as possible? We’ll never have stockouts,
manufacturing can have long production runs, and product design can
design the perfect product that does everything. Oh, ﬁnance may complain
a little, and sales may complain a lot (because we have to charge so
much), but our suppliers, customers, and employees will be happy. What
is wrong with that?
Well, for one thing, everybody may be happy for a month or so, but
then you will have to start paying for all that inventory you bought and
made. It won’t be long before you are out of business. Obviously nobody
wants that to happen (except your competitors), so executive manage-
ment does care about managing inventory. The question to be answered
is, “To what degree do they care or get involved?” The only advice I
can give you about this TIP is simple and to the point: Management
must establish and lead a company culture where rightsizing
inventory is a way of life. It must be committed and involved for
this to happen.
Table 11.2 shows the Woodstock inventory balances at the end of
November, and Table 11.3 shows the raw material inventory turns based
on the estimated annual cost of goods sold (COGS).

December 31: Supply-Chain Manager Meeting and 
Companywide Video Conference
Woodstock Inventory: $30.1 Million
My name is Adriana and I am the president of Woodstock Lighting Group.
I’m very excited. Today is going to be a wonderful day. I get the opportunity
to speak with all our employees about our accomplishments for the year
and our bright outlook for the future. I’m really proud of this team and
want to tell it. This will be the ﬁrst time I will be using a video conference
to speak with everyone in “real time,” and I have spent a lot of time
preparing my notes on what I want to say.
When I joined Woodstock as an accountant almost 16 years ago, little
did I think that I would be president of the company one day. Well, I’ve
been president for three years now, and I’m looking forward to many more
years leading this ﬁne group of people. To think I almost quit two years
ago when the going really got tough. But my children, Austin and Marlene,
convinced me to stay. It was their conﬁdence in me that kept me going.
Being president of a company isn’t a “nine to ﬁve” job, and I have missed
far too many soccer games and dance recitals.

Rightsizing Inventory
I’m not a vindictive person, but Joe was wearing me out. I tried not to
show it, especially when others were around. His negative attitude and his
large ego alienated him from a lot of people. To this day, people are still
trying to ﬁnd out whether Joe quit or I ﬁred him. But I’ll never tell. Only
the Board of Directors and I know what happened. Arnie was the right
choice to replace Joe as vice president of operations. When I retire, I will
recommend to the board that it consider Arnie for my job. That is, if he
doesn’t retire before I do. It’s good to see how our employees have rallied
around him this year. They say the sign of good leaders is that they surround
themselves with good managers — and he is the best.
Today at the video conference, I will report the year-end results. I don’t
want to bore everyone with a lot of facts and ﬁgures so I will just hit the
highlights of last year’s accomplishments. But ﬁrst I have a meeting with
all our supply-chain managers to review our new inventory rightsizing
model that was developed by the Harmony Team. This day is going to pass
very quickly.
Adriana’s Meeting with the 
Supply-Chain Managers
I personally want to thank each and every one of you
for an outstanding year. We have turned the corner and
have set the stage for many successful years to come.
I will go into the ﬁnancial results when I address all our
employees at our video conference later today. But for
now, I want to talk about our inventory rightsizing
efforts and accomplishments for the year. As you all
should be aware, I ﬁrmly believe that controlling the
level and location of inventory in our supply chain will
be the key to our future success. Along with the Har-
mony Team, you have worked hard to build a solid
inventory management foundation, and you should be
proud of your achievements.
The Woodstock inventory rightsizing model you have
all developed together will be the model we will use to
guide our business for years to come. Figure 12.1 is the
current version of the inventory model. I hesitate to
use the words “ﬁnal version” because it will always be
an ongoing, iterative process, being adjusted to ﬁt the
current business environment.

Silos Can Be Turned into a Collaborative Supply-Chain Network

Although the ﬂow of the model implies a “sequential
process,” it is in reality a “concurrent process” with all
activities being worked on at the same time. I have cho-
sen to present this model to you myself rather than have
the Harmony Team present it because I strongly believe
this model will be the key to our success in the future.
Woodstock Inventory Strategy
Contrary to public opinion, rightsizing inventory doesn’t start with the
customer. It starts with Woodstock. When we decided what business to
be in and what markets to serve, we were deﬁning our own inventory
strategy. The very nature of our ﬂashlight market dictates that we make
ﬂashlights (make-to-stock) and sell them from inventory. This is the plan
until we can get our total lead time, including manufacturing, to be less
than our customer delivery lead time. Since this isn’t going to happen in
the short term, we must make-to-stock and sell-from-stock. The spotlight
market is somewhat different. The nature of that market requires that we
make-to-order or assemble-to-order. Until we can reduce our purchasing

and manufacturing lead time, this strategy calls for us to stock raw materials
and subassemblies rather than ﬁnished goods.
The beacon light market requires a third strategy. The nature of this
market is that we engineer-to-order or make-to-order (with the exception
of the spare parts and service part of our business). This strategy calls for
stocking a minimal amount of standard raw materials and subassemblies
and no ﬁnished goods.
So you see, until we can reduce our total lead time and operate with
a minimum amount of inventory, we must follow the inventory strategies
dictated by the marketplace for our business. I believe it really struck
home for me when the inventory got out of control last year. Around
$40 million is a lot of inventory; far more inventory than we need or
should have to run our business. The ﬁrst place for us to start was to
recognize how important inventory rightsizing is to our business. It is by
far our single biggest cost of doing business, and we must pay serious
attention to it.
I knew then that we had to change the way we thought about inventory
and a change of company culture had to take place. After all, our entire
supply chain exists to provide inventory to our customers. If we can’t do
it more efﬁciently and cost effectively than our competition, we will indeed
cease to exist. The Harmony Team was established to help drive our
inventory rightsizing effort. We recognized that inventory could not be
managed effectively by individual silos and it would take a collaborative
effort across all supply-chain links.
In order for all of our supply-chain links to collaborate on rightsizing
inventory, we all needed to understand what role each link played in
managing inventory. It has been an eye opener for me, as I’m sure it has
been for each of you. It has taken us a year to get to know everyone’s
role, and even at that, we still have more to learn from each other. The
Harmony Team began by benchmarking all our vital inventory statistics.
We needed to understand where we are today before we could begin the
inventory rightsizing effort. We did it, and it wasn’t a pretty picture.
Align Inventory to Company Strategy
We compared our inventory strategies (make-to-stock, make-to-order,
assemble-to-order, and engineer-to-order) with our inventory positions
(raw material, work-in-process, and ﬁnished goods) and inventory loca-
tions (storeroom, manufacturing, distribution, etc.) in our supply chain.
The results of this comparison were surprising. To highlight two areas,
we found that beacon lights (make-to-order and engineer-to-order) had
50 percent of its inventory in ﬁnished goods, when in fact it should have

Silos Can Be Turned into a Collaborative Supply-Chain Network

425
no ﬁnished goods inventory. In contrast, the ﬂashlight strategy (make-to-
stock) only had 46 percent of its inventory in ﬁnished goods, and 18
percent of its inventory in work-in-process.
As you will hear later today, we are in the process of realigning our
inventories to match our company inventory strategy and have made some
progress. It will take us some time to get where we want to be. But as
you can see from the inventory rightsizing model, we continue to go
through the process of matching inventory position and location to our
inventory strategy.
Customer Inventory Strategy
I started out by saying that inventory strategy is driven by our business
plan, which deﬁnes the marketplaces we will service. We then need to
align our inventory to match that strategy. Once under way it is important
to understand the inventory needs of our customers. At this point, we are
no longer talking about a “marketplace” in general terms but speciﬁc
customers by name and location. Based on input from these customers
(internal and external), we have developed a criterion for the perfect
order and are striving to achieve that criterion. We have adopted a policy
of customer literacy. We want to learn as much about the customers as
possible, including learning about the needs of our customer’s customer.
We are also seeking to understand our customers’ inventory ﬂows and
inventory planning processes.
We are exploring the possibility of allowing our customers access to
our inventory information. We are in the early stages of doing this and
will provide some form of inventory information to key customers next
year. We also want to get access to our key customers’ MRP output reports
for planned orders. If we can do this it will greatly improve our planning
process. This entire process of trying to get to know the customer better
is called customer relationship management (CRM), and we are actually
exploring the use of customer relationship management (CRM) software
for next year.
We are also in the process of aligning our inventory positions,
locations, and levels with the traditional inventory life-cycle phases,
and have found many items to be out of alignment with the life-cycle
phase they should reﬂect. I have visited many of our customers this
year and have listened to their concerns and issues. Overall, most of
them are pleased with our products, but they tell me our service needs
to improve. A few of our key customers are very excited about our
inventory rightsizing efforts and believe it will help improve our rela-
tionship with them.

Rightsizing Inventory
Financial Plans
Our cash ﬂow has improved dramatically over the year, thanks in no small
part to our inventory rightsizing efforts. About halfway through the year,
we started to track budgets to actual expense for each of our supply-
chain links and made adjustments when they got out of line. Finance has
implemented some meaningful performance metrics related to inventory
valuation and has started to give feedback to each link in our supply
chain. We only turned inventory 1.7 times last year and have shown some
improvement this year. Our inventory accuracy last year was about 88
percent from a ﬁnancial point of view and somewhere around 75 percent
at the SKU level. We began cycle counting this year and have seen vast
improvements. We have also sorted our inventory into ABC classiﬁcations
and have established a criterion for each category.
As you will learn in other sections of our inventory rightsizing model,
ﬁnance now has access to all our company planning documents, in
particular our new sales and operations plan (S&OP). Rather than relying
only on the forecast, the new S&OP gives ﬁnance access to information
it never had before. This will greatly enhance its ability to monitor
projected cash inﬂow and outﬂow. We have begun to write off certain
inventory items that no longer have value in the marketplace. In order to
keep these write-offs under control, any inventory write-off transaction of
greater than $1,000 must be signed off by Pat and me. Inventory carrying
cost last year exceeded $10 million. This year, because of the reduction
in inventory and more realistic carrying cost data, that number has been
reduced to $7.0 million. That is a $3.0 million savings. Not only did we
achieve a cost savings, but we also freed up some much-needed space
in our facilities.
Sales and Operations Planning
We have learned from sales and marketing just how competitive it is out
there in the marketplace. Our competition is global, and having inventory
stockouts may cause us to lose an order — and the customer as well.
This past year marketing conducted a detailed analysis of the marketplace
and our customer needs. Its ﬁndings are being shared with all supply-
chain links. Some of the marketing programs we implemented in the past
have had a negative effect on inventory. We have identiﬁed them and
have stopped using them. They were doing more harm than good.
This year the sales team has a better understanding of the role fore-
casting plays with our inventory strategy. The forecast is now part of our
S&OP process. The data is more realistic and is being shared with all

Silos Can Be Turned into a Collaborative Supply-Chain Network

supply-chain links. We have changed our sales compensation incentive
programs to match our inventory strategy. Salespeople are now properly
compensated to sell the large inventories of slow-moving goods that are
just sitting in our warehouses. IT has found a sales forecasting package
that will meet our forecasting needs, and it will be implemented early
next year.
We have now formalized our S&OP process and educated all the
appropriate employees who will be part of this process. All key supply-
chain links are now taking an active role in developing the S&OP. The
business plan is a critical input to the S&OP process. In the past, I made
the mistake of not sharing the details of the business plan with all supply-
chain links. I have now corrected this problem, and all supply-chain links
now know the details of the business plan. The accuracy of the S&OP
will be key to our successfully rightsizing inventory. The S&OP document
drives all other planning processes and documents.
Planning and Purchasing
Planning and purchasing are responsible for managing the six “rights” of
inventory management: the right product, at the right time, in the right
quality, in the right quantity, at the right price, from the right supplier.
The planning group disaggregates the S&OP plan and creates an MPS that
drives the MRP process; all important steps to rightsizing our inventory.
They also check for available resources to meet the MPS and MRP plans.
Until recently, planning spent most of its time (about 70 percent) expe-
diting needed materials and replanning the MPS.
That is starting to change. I met with Cyndie recently and she told me
she and her team now spend less than 50 percent of their time expediting;
freeing them up to ﬁne-tune the MPS and MRP plans. This year we have
implemented a new planning policy. We have divided our MPS into three
separate planning zones, and different levels of authority are required to
make schedule changes within those zones. Everyone now understands
the impact a schedule change will make on the entire manufacturing plan.
We have policies and procedures as to who should be contacted about
speciﬁc changes and the time frame required to notify that group about
the change.
Sales and design engineering are continuing to review our inventory
for items that can be substituted, rather than going out and purchasing
more inventory. This activity has helped us reduce the amount of excess
and slow-moving inventory. Overall, raw material inventory has been
reduced by $4 million this year, going from $17 million to $13 million.
Our sales link is doing the same with the ﬁnished goods inventory. Actual

428

Rightsizing Inventory
sales are compared to forecasted sales every month. This information is
being communicated to all of you. I am also pleased to say that purchasing
has established an SRM program with several of our key suppliers, and
they are working together to improve our costs and lead times. In addition
to that, they have established a vendor managed inventory system with
our battery supplier. This will help us reduce costs and maintain a lower
level of battery inventory.
We are back on track with our MRP system, and our BILL of Integrity
has become much more reliable and accurate. Our goal is to achieve 100
percent accuracy by the end of next ﬁscal year. We have implemented a
BILL of Integrity audit procedure that I am conﬁdent will make this happen.
Product and Process Design
We now understand the importance that product design plays in the new
product development process. We have found that 50 percent to 70 percent
of our product cost is determined in the product design phase. Product
design no longer works in a silo. It now works concurrently with all of
you, and our suppliers and customers are part of the design team from
the very beginning. Beyond the product itself, product design has an
impact on other supply-chain costs such as packaging, storage, picking,
packing, and shipping. All of these are considerations now being dealt
with during the product design phase.
Manufacturing is also impacted by the product design. All new products
are now designed for manufacturability and for efﬁcient assembly.
Process design is another link that has moved from being a silo
organization to being a cross-functional work team. We have reorganized
the layout of the assembly areas and have turned some into U-shaped
work cells. We will continue to look at other work centers to develop a
more efﬁcient layout and continuous ﬂow of product. A rewarding by-
product of this process has been the rebalancing of operation times
between operators. I truly believe one of the biggest accomplishments
we have made this year was the cross-training of our employees. Not
only has this enhanced their personal skill sets and improved morale, but
it has greatly enhanced our ﬂexibility to respond to changing production
schedules. At another level, we are balancing workloads at all work centers
and work cells so that upstream and downstream workloads are in sync.
We are now using reusable standard size containers to move work-in-
process (WIP) inventory through our supply chain. This will greatly
improve the ﬂow, visibility, and handling of inventory. We are developing
value stream maps for every operation at every work center. All non-
value-added steps will be eliminated. The next step after that is to improve

Silos Can Be Turned into a Collaborative Supply-Chain Network

429
the efﬁciency of the value-added steps that remain. We will continue to
question every activity performed throughout our entire supply chain.
Manufacturing Plans
Manufacturing continues to look for ways to reduce the amount of raw
materials in our supply chain. WIP inventory has been reduced by $2.7
million this year, going from $7.5 million to $4.8 million, an outstanding
achievement. Manufacturing lead time has been addressed and is being
diligently watched for opportunities to further reduce the total lead time.
We have implemented a new load proﬁle report that has helped us move
more people to overloaded work centers. This has helped us reduce
overtime expense and maintain a stable work force. I’m pleased to say
that this is the ﬁrst year in a very long time when we haven’t had to lay
off direct labor employees.
One of the biggest manufacturing undertakings this year has been the
implementation of a “lean manufacturing” philosophy. Using this
approach, we were able to eliminate many non-value-added steps in our
manufacturing processes. Going forward into next year we will continue
to aggressively pursue lean manufacturing techniques. We have identiﬁed
many areas where waste can be eliminated, leaving only value-added
steps in the process. As part of our lean initiative we have implemented
a companywide good housekeeping program using the 5s approach. I
can’t tell you what a pleasure it is to walk around the plant now. It is
clean and very organized. Next year we are taking the good housekeeping
initiative into the ofﬁces.
As part of our effort to improve the accuracy of our BILL of Integrity,
we have implemented better controls in our storeroom. No material will
be moved out of the storeroom without the proper paperwork. In addition
to that, storeroom personnel are now bringing materials to the work
centers rather than operators leaving their machines to fetch materials.
Distribution Plans
Effective the ﬁrst of the year, we will begin the process of shutting down
our distribution centers in Chicago and Texas. California and New Jersey
will remain. We will contract with third-party logistics providers to service
speciﬁc areas of our marketplace not easily reached by our two remaining
distribution centers. Unfortunately, these closures will affect 60 of our
employees; all of them will be offered an opportunity to stay with the
company somewhere in our supply chain. For those who choose to move

430

Rightsizing Inventory
on, we are putting together a ﬁnancial package and will help each and
every person ﬁnd gainful employment in their local area.
The strain on our warehouse space has been eased by the reduction
in ﬁnished goods inventory. Finished goods inventory went from $15.5
million at the beginning of the year down to $12.3 million at the end of
the year. This represents a reduction of $3.2 million. I am pleased to say
that we no longer have trailers full of inventory sitting in our yard. Another
area that has shown some improvement this year was our order ﬁll rate.
We have gone from an average ﬁll rate of 85 percent to 90 percent, and
our goal for next year is a ﬁll rate of 100 percent. By continuing to work
together as a team I am conﬁdent that we can achieve this.
Our inventory cycle counting program is in full swing, and our inventory
accuracy has improved from 88 percent overall to 95 percent. Although
we didn’t meet our goal of 99 percent by the end of this year, we are well
on our way to achieve that goal by early ﬁrst quarter of next year.
Effective the ﬁrst of the year, we are going to outsource our reverse
logistics function. It is not part of our core competency, and we have
contracted with a 4PL who specializes in this activity and has an
excellent reputation in the marketplace. I am conﬁdent that reverse
logistics can be a proﬁt center for us as we move into new markets
for our products. There will be no employee layoffs because of this
outsourcing of reverse logistics.
Information Technology Plans
Every single employee of Woodstock uses the services of our information
technology link. Although we think of product moving through our supply
chain, we also have learned that moving information through our supply
chain is just as important. Information can and will replace inventory in
our supply chain. IT interacts with our suppliers and customers and in
some cases it interacts with our suppliers’ suppliers and our customers’
customers. In fact, due to the ever-growing popularity and use of the
Internet, we are even communicating with the general public.
This is a good thing, and in the very near future we hope to expand
the use of this service by offering an online sales catalog. You will hear
more about this exciting opportunity early next year. Although IT is
responsible for maintaining our BILL of Integrity once the data is in the
system, we all still have the responsibility to input accurate data that can
be converted into useful and meaningful information.
We have put in a no-change policy for the implementation and use
of application software. This means we will no longer modify off-the-shelf
software unless and until we are convinced that the modiﬁcations are

Silos Can Be Turned into a Collaborative Supply-Chain Network

431
necessary. The use of bar coding will be expanded next year, and
somewhere in our future we will look at RFID. EDI and EDT will also
continue to be part of our near future. Next year you will see an expanded
use of these technologies.
IT will no longer head up end-user application implementations.
Although it will continue to be a vital part of the implementation team,
each of you will have end users from your team heading up application
software implementations. IT is considered an asset that is important to
the future of Woodstock. I expect it to keep us on the leading edge of
the new technologies as they emerge.
Support Resource Plans
I wish to recognize four of our supply-chain links that are not often
considered when we talk about rightsizing inventory in our supply chain.
The contributions of ﬁeld service, human resources, maintenance, and
facilities management have been considerable.
Once again, ﬁeld service has achieved its sales goals. This makes six
years in a row it has done so. My sincere congratulations to all of you. A
signiﬁcant portion of its revenue comes from selling inventory, 25 percent
of which it also installs, ﬁeld service’s contribution goes beyond that. This
year ﬁeld service staff have worked with all of you to help rightsize our
inventory. They know some of our customers better than anyone, and they
have ﬁrsthand knowledge about how some of our products work in the
ﬁeld. They have helped product design eliminate some unnecessary parts
in our products. They have also identiﬁed parts that could be changed to
make our products function better in operation. They are now providing
important customer and product information into our CRM system, which
will be automated next year. Field service is also communicating directly
with our suppliers to help them improve the parts we buy from them.
We have eliminated the depot inventory that we stored close to airports,
and all spare parts will be shipped out of New Jersey. We are combining
ﬁeld service spare parts with maintenance and facilities management
inventory into one physical location in New Jersey. Rather than spending
time managing inventory, ﬁeld service staff can spend that time helping
us in many other ways. When they are not in the ﬁeld at customer sites,
they are helping out maintenance and facility management, where their
expertise is the most helpful. They also spent a lot of time this year on
the factory ﬂoor with our industrial engineers seeking ways to improve
our manufacturing processes.
Human resources (HR) has made a contribution to our inventory
rightsizing efforts as well. I am pleased to announce that we now have

432

Rightsizing Inventory
established “Woodstock University,” our own internal resource for educa-
tion and training. An important part of the curriculum is the inventory
management program. There are varying degrees of education and training
available for all employees. Everyone will know and understand how
important it is to manage inventory effectively.
HR has also been instrumental in developing the new “shared” per-
formance measurements that we have implemented throughout the year.
I know each of you supply chain managers has spent a lot of your time
with Aimee and her team in accomplishing this. HR has kept up to date
on the latest beneﬁt and salary standards that apply to our industry. This
has been, and will continue to be, an asset as we try to attract the very
best people to join our team. The newly revised company newsletter will
be rolled out in January, and I will personally write an inventory- related
article every month. An employee of the month for outstanding contribu-
tions to our inventory rightsizing effort will be chosen and recognized in
the newsletter. Starting early next year, HR will migrate from a legacy
system over to our company ERP system.
Maintenance keeps our machines and equipment in good working
order so that our supply chain can operate at the highest possible level
of efﬁciency. Starting in the fourth quarter of this year, maintenance now
publishes a schedule of preventative maintenance activities. We have never
done this before and we see it as an asset to our rightsizing efforts.
Maintenance has also gone beyond just performing preventative mainte-
nance. It is now taking a proactive role in improving our machine
efﬁciency so that we can improve efﬁciency without adding stress to our
machine operators.
Maintenance has played a big role in helping us reduce machine setup
time — and you all understand how important that is. The beneﬁts gained
thus far have been good. Maintenance personnel have reduced the setup
times dramatically, going from hours to minutes. This is wonderful; it will
help reduce our total lead time and have a positive impact on lot sizes.
This all translates to improving our ﬂexibility so that we can respond to
customer changes faster. The new AGVS system that was approved earlier
in the year will be installed by maintenance in February of next year. This
will help us improve the ﬂow and movement of inventory between our
storeroom, manufacturing, order picking, and shipping.
Facilities management ofﬁcials have been actively involved in our Good
Housekeeping campaign. They have been instrumental in keeping our
aisles safe and free of debris. The tool room, which was part of the facilities
management machine shop, has been moved. All tools are now stored at
point of use in the proper work center. It is no longer necessary for a
machine operator to go seek out a needed tool. This will improve operator
efﬁciency and machine productivity. Throughout the year, as we reduced

Silos Can Be Turned into a Collaborative Supply-Chain Network

433
inventory, facilities has been right there removing and reorganizing the
shelves used to store inventory. The storeroom is looking better every day.
A new roof was installed in Building #2 this year. This will minimize
the amount of damaged goods we have to deal with. I don’t know if you
were aware or not, but we had to scrap some inventory this year due to
the leak in the roof. Facilities, too, has been working with industrial
engineering to improve the plant layout so that materials can ﬂow on a
continuous basis.
Sustaining the Inventory Rightsizing Model
Thus far, I have spoken about all the positive things we have done
together to rightsize our inventory. Last month Jack highlighted the ten
most common mistakes companies make when trying to rightsize their
inventory. I would like to see that list published and sent out to all
employees with an explanation of how we can avoid falling into that
category. We must install this new way of life in the minds of all our
employees. We will constantly review our inventory rightsizing model
and adjust it as business conditions change. We will have a supply-chain
managers meeting every month, led by the Harmony Team. All supply-
chain links will report on the current inventory status in their link and
what they are doing to continue the rightsizing effort. Managing inventory
correctly is a cross-functional effort, and the old mentality of managing
inventory in silos is no longer part of our company culture. Anyone can
reduce and “rightsize” inventory over a given period of time, but only a
change of culture will sustain the effort on a continuous basis. That’s the
way it will be for Woodstock. Thank you for your time. You have done
a wonderful job of changing our inventory silos into a collaborative
supply-chain network.
Adriana’s Video Conference with 
All Employees
Good morning. I wanted to share my thoughts with all
of you, report the highlights of last year, and talk a little
bit about our bright future together. It has been a good
year, and I want to thank you all for your contributions.
For the ﬁrst time in a very long time our company was
proﬁtable. Although we didn’t make a lot of money, we
did report a proﬁt of $5 million for the year. Our sales
increased by 9 percent, going from $90 million to $98

434

Rightsizing Inventory
million, and we only missed our sales target by 2 per-
cent. All three divisions contributed to this effort.
This year we have embarked on an inventory rightsizing
effort with the objectives of aligning our inventory to
our business strategy and our customers’ business
strategy. I’m pleased to report that we have made sig-
niﬁcant progress and we are well prepared to continue
our efforts into the future. As shown in Table 12.1, we
started the year with $40.0 million in inventory and
ended the year with $30.1 million. This represents a 25
percent inventory reduction. All three categories of
inventory were reduced; raw materials were reduced
by 24 percent, WIP inventory was reduced by 36 per-
cent, and ﬁnished goods was reduced by 21 percent.
Not only have you reduced inventory, but you have
repositioned it in our supply chain to more closely
reﬂect our business strategy and the inventory require-
ments of our customers.
Table 12.2 shows that we have gotten rid of $1.6 million
of excess inventory and $2.9 million of obsolete inven-
tory. This represents 45 percent of the total dollar
amount of inventory reduction. In addition, the value
of our “A” items has been reduced by $3 million.
Table 12.3 shows the greatest percentage of inventory
reduction comes from the Beacon Light Division. This
represents a 55 percent reduction, going from $4 mil-
lion to $1.8 million. The largest dollar value reduction
comes from the Flashlight Division, which represents a
$6 million reduction, going from $28 million down to
$22 million; a 22 percent reduction. Our Spotlight Divi-
sion saw a raw material reduction of 25 percent and a
total inventory reduction of 21 percent.
Based on our cost of goods this year, and our average
inventory throughout the year, our inventory turns have
increased from 1.7 turns ($60M/$35M = 1.7) to 1.9 turns
($66M/$34M = 1.9). Based on this formula the inventory
turns didn’t change much. Most of the inventory reduc-
tion came toward the latter part of the year and so this
formula doesn’t represent a true picture of what we
have accomplished. However, based on our year-end
inventory as shown in Table 12.4 the inventory turns by

category have improved dramatically. The higher (esti-

A recent analysis shows that our overall inventory accu-
racy has increased from 88 percent to 98 percent by the
end of this year. Equally important, we have identiﬁed
the root causes of those errors and are working hard

to correct them. You have accomplished all this without
having a negative impact on customer service. On the
contrary, we have seen vast improvements in this area.
Our overall customer satisfaction, based on the perfect
order criteria, has increased to 97 percent, and our
order ﬁll rate is approaching 99 percent. Our customers
are more involved than ever before. They are working
with us on improving our existing products, helping us
design new products, and are also actively involved in

Last but not least, I want to congratulate all of you for
your team spirit and cooperation. Thanks to the efforts
of the Harmony Team, we now all understand the role
each of us plays in our inventory rightsizing efforts. We
no longer function as independent silos. Along with
our customers, we now function as a single entity. We

shared goals and objectives. We have made great
strides but still have a long way to go. By working
together we will get there. Don’t ever give up hope. You
are the key to our success. By working together we have
turned our inventory silos into a collaborative supply-
chain network. Thank you for your time…
It has been a long but satisfying year. There will be many
new and difﬁcult challenges in the years to come. But
I truly believe we have the right team and we are doing
the right things to rightsize our inventory. Knowing all
that, last night I slept like a baby …

TIPS on How to 
“Rightsize” Inventory
TIP #1: Communicate, communicate, communicate … with every-
one.
TIP #2: Someone in the company must recognize that change is
needed, become the champion, and take a leadership role to make
it happen.
TIP #3: Executive management must be committed and involved
for change to take place.
TIP #4: If you want to learn anything, ask questions — lots of
questions.
TIP #5: When starting out on an inventory rightsizing effort, you
must ﬁrst benchmark where you are in terms of current inventory
levels by category and location in the supply chain.
TIP #6: Rightsizing inventory is the responsibility of everyone in
the supply chain, and performance metrics should be shared by
all links in the supply chain.
TIP #7: Pick a team, establish goals and objectives, benchmark
where you are, and identify shared performance measurements.
Communicate this to everyone.
TIP #8: Delegate authority, accountability, and responsibility to
those who can best accomplish the task of rightsizing inventory
in the supply chain.

442

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #9: Rightsizing inventory is not “just another project” with a
start date and an end date; it has to become a new way of life for
the company.
TIP #10: Start rightsizing your inventory by aligning your inventory
levels to match your inventory strategies by product or division
classiﬁcations.
TIP #11: Gather inventory data by type, location, and business
segment. Compare them to the corporate inventory strategy. Any
inconsistency in inventory and strategy must be addressed and
corrected.
TIP #12: Inventory is considered as an asset on the company
balance sheet. Inventory is a liability if you have more than you
need to satisfy immediate customer requirements.
TIP #13: The perfect order must be considered from both the
viewpoints of the seller and the buyer. The perfect order criteria
must be measurable so that deviations can be corrected.
TIP #14: Successful supply chains have one characteristic in com-
mon; their ability to rapidly respond to change throughout their
entire supply chain, not just one or two links in the chain.
TIP #15: A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link;
being world class in one link does you little good if your other
links are weak.
TIP #16: Deﬁne the perfect order criteria and measure them.
Communicate this to everyone in the supply chain.
TIP #17: The customer isn’t always right, but if you want to keep
the customer, you should do all you can to satisfy their require-
ments in a professional, businesslike manner.
TIP #18: Understanding the customers’ needs is a good thing, but
anticipating your customers’ needs is an order winner that will
help you sell more inventory.
TIP #19: We must present ourselves as one united, collaborative
supply-chain network to our customers and establish clearly
deﬁned lines of communication with them.
TIP #20: Know as much as possible about your customer: their
needs, wants, problems, plans, and who else they buy from.
TIP #21: A successful supply chain knows its customers well and
can anticipate their inventory needs. In some cases, it may be an
inventory need that they don’t recognize they have.
TIP #22: Don’t keep inventory information a secret. Share it with
your customers. Ask your customers to share their inventory infor-
mation with you.
TIP #23: Lead time is deﬁned differently for each link in your
supply chain. The most important deﬁnition is related to customer

Appendix B: TIPS on How to “Rightsize” Inventory

443
order lead time: from the time they ask you to ship the inventory
until they receive the inventory.
TIP #24: We need to understand not only what inventory metrics
our customers are using but also how they are using (calculating) it.
TIP #25: All stages of the sales cycle are equally important and
should be measured throughout the entire supply chain.
TIP #26: It’s nice to know how good we are; we have to know
how bad we are.
TIP #27: Get all supply-chain links involved in the product design
phase. Decisions made in this phase will have a signiﬁcant impact
on inventory in all the other inventory life-cycle phases.
TIP #28: All categories of inventory must be aligned with the
product life-cycle strategy and must be aligned well before moving
out of that particular product life-cycle phase.
TIP #29: Focus on high-value inventory items ﬁrst. This will have
the greatest impact on aligning inventory in your supply chain.
TIP #30: High inventory levels cannot always be blamed on the
need for safety stock, because of customer uncertainty. More often
than not, other problems cause the high levels of inventory.
TIP #31: Inventory levels will remain unabated and uncontrolled
until accountability, responsibility, and shared performance metrics
are assigned, measured, and communicated to all links in the
supply chain.
TIP #32: Financial documents must be prepared in accordance
with all laws and regulations, regardless of how bad they may
make the company look. Inventory is a major component of
ﬁnancial reporting and must be presented as accurately as possible.
TIP #33: Inventory moves into our ﬁnancial reporting system as
an asset on our balance sheet and remains there until it is shipped
and billed to a customer (accounts receivable) or disposed of in
some form or another.
TIP #34: Inventory also moves into our ﬁnancial reporting system
as a liability (if we didn’t pay for it yet) as part of the accounts
payable on our balance sheet and remains there until it is paid for.
TIP #35: Finance looks at inventory turns and days of supply in
the aggregate, but for operations to address this issue in its inven-
tory rightsizing efforts, inventory turns, days of supply, and COGS
need to be broken down into inventory types and families at the
item-level detail.
TIP #36: Analyze your inventory for activity. If there hasn’t
been any activity on an item in inventory for 12 months or
longer, consider disposing of it. This includes raw materials and
ﬁnished goods.

444

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #37: There is a direct relationship between the level of inven-
tory carried and the cost of carrying inventory. When the inventory
level increases, carrying cost increases; when the inventory level
decreases, carrying cost decreases.
TIP #38: Select an inventory valuation method that best reﬂects
the true value of your inventory and conforms to GAAP guidelines.
TIP #39: Inventory valuation must be realistic and reﬂect the true
value of your inventory. Consider adjusting the value of your
inventory downward if it falls below the current replacement cost
or the current selling price of the product. Take the loss earlier
rather than later.
TIP #40: Cost accounting must capture the true cost of adding
value to a raw material, so that ﬁnished goods are valued correctly
for sales and marketing to establish selling prices that conform to
company proﬁtability guidelines.
TIP #41: As a raw material moves through the manufacturing
process, labor adds value and increases the cost of the item. If the
item goes back into inventory, it goes back at a higher cost, thus
increasing the total value of the inventory. If possible, delay adding
value to a raw material until it can be shipped without going back
into inventory.
TIP #42: Inventory inaccuracy has a negative impact on the entire
supply chain, can decrease customer service and productivity lev-
els, and can increase costs. You must improve inventory accuracy.
TIP #43: Each company must deﬁne the criteria used to measure
inventory accuracy, measure accuracy against the criteria, and
communicate all this to all employees in the supply chain.
TIP #44: Marketing has a direct and indirect impact on inventory
levels and strategy. Typically, the higher the forecast (make-to-
stock strategy), the higher the inventory level. Marketing programs
and budgets should be set in proportion to inventory levels and
inventory strategy.
TIP #45: Supply-chain links within a single supply chain may have
conﬂicting inventory goals and objectives. You cannot rightsize
your inventory until these conﬂicting objectives are resolved and
balanced.
TIP #46: The purpose of establishing inventory planning zones is
to recognize the degree of difﬁculty to make changes and to allow
enough time for all supply-chain links to react to the change in
an economical, efﬁcient manner.
TIP #47: Forecasting has a direct impact on inventory levels.
Overforecasting may cause inventory levels to increase if it’s not

Appendix B: TIPS on How to “Rightsize” Inventory

445
sold, whereas underforecasting will decrease inventory levels but
may lead to stockouts.
TIP #48: The ability to rapidly respond to forecast changes will
greatly improve your ability to rightsize your inventory.
TIP #49: Selection and successful implementation of a forecasting
tool will greatly improve your chances of rightsizing your inventory.
TIP #50: All sources of demand must be considered when planning
for inventory supply and demand at the S&OP level.
TIP #51: The business plan is a major input to the S&OP process;
a realistic, achievable production plan cannot be developed without
knowing and following the guidelines that are established in the
business plan.
TIP # 52: The production plan, as part of the S&OP process, is an
important tool that, if used correctly, can help us rightsize our
inventory.
TIP #53: Do not attempt to drastically reduce inventory levels of
active items until the impact on customer service levels is under-
stood by all links in the supply chain. Plan to reduce inventory,
then measure customer service performance. If there is no negative
impact on customer service, plan to reduce inventory again.
TIP #54: The S&OP process plays a major role in your inventory
rightsizing efforts. All other steps in the inventory planning pro-
cess are guided by the inventory planning numbers established
in the S&OP.
TIP #55: The S&OP is the primary tool used to develop inventory
plans for producing, purchasing, and stocking speciﬁc end prod-
ucts, spare parts, and subassemblies.
TIP #56: The MPS disaggregates the numbers in the S&OP, and
the sum of the items in the MPS must be equal to the product
family numbers in the S&OP.
TIP #57: The ability to react to change in a rapid and responsive
manner will be a key to any inventory rightsizing effort.
TIP #58: Develop, document, and communicate a procedure to
be followed when changes occur. Educate all employees on the
importance of communicating changes to the proper links in the
supply chain.
TIP #59: Changes to the MPS in zone 1 can increase costs and
inventory levels. Changes in zone 1 should be kept to a minimum
and analyzed for the total impact to the supply chain.
TIP #60: Every time an unplanned order (impact order) is expe-
dited into the schedule, another order (or more) should be de-
expedited.

446

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #61: The contents of the business plan related to inventory
management activities should be communicated to all supply-chain
employees who have an impact on achieving those goals and
objectives.
TIP #62: Balancing workload (MPS) with available capacity is an
important step in rightsizing inventory levels in the supply chain.
TIP #63: Reducing machine setup time will allow for producing
smaller batches of inventory more frequently and will help reduce
the amount of inventory carried in stock.
TIP #64: Constantly review and update your lot-size rules with a
hypothetical goal of reducing all lot sizes to one. 
TIP #65: The MPS must be realistic and achievable. If not, inventory
will increase and customer service will decrease over time.
TIP #66: Executing the recommendations of MRP will have a
signiﬁcant impact on inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #67: Inventory accuracy must be in the 98 percent to 100
percent range for MRP to function successfully. It will be almost
impossible to rightsize inventory without this level of inventory
accuracy.
TIP #68: Have design engineering review the current inventory and
provide a list of parts that can be used to substitute for the primary
part as long as it can meet the criteria of form, ﬁt, and function.
TIP #69: Inaccurate purchasing and manufacturing lead times have
a signiﬁcant impact on inventory levels and require constant review
and updating. An operating policy must be in place to ensure that
lead times are current and up to date. 
TIP #70: Lot-size rules have a signiﬁcant impact on inventory levels
and should be reviewed and updated constantly. An operating
policy must be in place to ensure this happens.
TIP #71: The four areas of data integrity don’t just apply to MRP;
these four areas are important to all links in the supply chain.
TIP #72: Because purchased material typically represents more
than 50 percent of COGS, focusing on SRM with key suppliers will
signiﬁcantly improve inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #73: Implementation of a successful (and mutually beneﬁcial)
VMI program with key suppliers will beneﬁt inventory rightsizing
efforts.
TIP #74: Any drastic changes in your MRP data may cause inventory
levels to rise, until inventory is rebalanced and adjusted to the new
planning requirements. Over time, it will begin to correct itself and
decrease accordingly.
TIP #75: Product design has a major impact on inventory costs
through every link in the supply chain. The design must become

Appendix B: TIPS on How to “Rightsize” Inventory

447
a cross-functional process with inputs from all links in the supply
chain, including suppliers and customers.
TIP #76: Designing products collaboratively with other links in the
supply chain can beneﬁt your inventory rightsizing effort by elim-
inating or reducing the total number and variety of parts that have
to be planned for and stocked in inventory.
TIP #77: Use an inventory postponement strategy that shifts prod-
uct differentiation as far downstream as possible, so that ﬁnal
inventory conﬁguration is committed when customer requirements
are known.
TIP #78: Look to substitute existing inventory into a product, rather
than going out to buy a similar part, if the substituted part can
perform the same form, ﬁt, and function to meet and satisfy
customer expectations.
TIP #79: A formal, structured part numbering system should be
used. Item codes should be kept as short and simple as possible
to eliminate the potential for translation errors, which may impede
your inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #80: Pushing inventory to another upstream or downstream
link in the supply chain will not solve your inventory rightsizing
problem. It will only pass the problem on to another link in the
supply chain.
TIP #81: Proper design of the manufacturing process has a signif-
icant impact on the total inventory in the supply chain, in general,
and work-in-process inventory, in particular. 
TIP #82: Process design must consider the impact process changes
in a work center might have on the upstream and downstream
work centers in its path.
TIP #83: Process design cannot take place in one inventory silo
at a time. It must be a collaborative effort across all supply-
chain links.
TIP #84: Operations and inventory ﬂows must be sequenced and
balanced in a work cell so that inventory ﬂows on a continuous
basis without WIP inventory increasing between operations.
TIP #85: Make use of existing space to store and move inventory
more effectively, rather than looking to relocate to a new facility.
TIP #86: Use value-stream mapping as a tool to help identify non-
value-added steps in the inventory ﬂow process. This should
include the process step, distance moved, and the time required
for each step in the inventory ﬂow.
TIP #87: Takt time is a tool that can be used to monitor actual
customer demand against actual production, so that adjustments
can be made to keep inventory supply and demand in balance.

448

Rightsizing Inventory
Tip #88: In a job-shop manufacturing environment, the bottleneck
operation is not stationary. It is constantly shifting from work center
to work center and will create an imbalance of your WIP inventory.
TIP #89: If supply (capacity) and demand (workload) are not in
balance, the change in inventory will negatively impact your inven-
tory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #90: Calculate capacity based on your normal work week. If
you normally operate ﬁve days a week, then calculate your capacity
based on ﬁve days. If you always operate seven days a week, then
you can calculate your capacity based on seven days.
TIP #91: Make sure your shop calendar is adjusted each year to
account for nonwork days. Failure to do so will hinder your
inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #92: Develop a load proﬁle report by work center. Distribute
it to all appropriate links in the supply chain so that each upstream
and downstream link can use it as a tool to make decisions that
impact inventory levels in the entire supply chain.
TIP #93: Producing defective parts will create multiple inventory
problems, add to your cost, reduce proﬁtability, and reduce capac-
ity. Design processes to ensure perfect quality.
TIP #94: Balance workﬂows and production resources as much
as possible so that wait time is kept to a minimum.
TIP #95: Any time the product is touched without value being
added is adding cost. All non-value-added touches are candidates
for elimination.
TIP #96: Inventory not needed to satisfy an immediate customer
requirement is considered wasteful and reduced or eliminated
when possible.
TIP #97: Company politics is a complete waste of time and energy.
Change the company culture and eliminate politics.
TIP #98: To be successful in your inventory rightsizing efforts,
information must be accurate and timely.
TIP #99: Working outside your job description is admirable and
shows teamwork, but it can be costly and wasteful. Delegate
authority, and train employees to do their job.
TIP #100: Complexity may cause problems and hinder your inven-
tory rightsizing efforts rather than help them.
TIP #101: Begin your lean initiative in an area of your supply
chain where opportunities for improvement are signiﬁcant. For
most manufacturing companies, this is usually the factory ﬂoor.
TIP #102: If you want to achieve success with a lean initiative,
you must have a plan in place prior to starting.

Appendix B: TIPS on How to “Rightsize” Inventory

449
TIP #103: When beginning your lean initiative, don’t focus on
eliminating inventory; focus on eliminating waste. A major beneﬁt
of eliminating waste will be the rightsizing of your inventory.
TIP #104: Moving from a push manufacturing philosophy to a pull
manufacturing philosophy will greatly beneﬁt your inventory right-
sizing efforts.
TIP #105: If multiple locations are pulling products from the same
source of production, inventory movement must be coordinated
and carefully planned for.
TIP #106: When implementing a pull system, gradually reduce the
lot-size quantity until you have achieved the smallest possible lot
size. The ideal goal would be to produce a lot size of one.
TIP #107: The storeroom is a good place to start your inventory
rightsizing efforts. Inventory accuracy begins with the receipt of
inventory into the storeroom.
TIP #108: Establishing an authorized control procedure for goods
moving into and out of the storeroom will greatly improve your
opportunity to rightsize your inventory.
TIP #109: The more inventory locations you have in your supply
chain, the higher the aggregate inventory in your supply chain.
TIP #110: Cycle counting inventory will greatly improve your
inventory record (perpetual and physical accuracy) and will have
a positive effect on your inventory rightsizing efforts.
TIP #111: Movement of inventory between links in the supply
chain must be coordinated on a daily basis. If not, your inven-
tory rightsizing efforts will quickly dissipate into a chaotic
situation.
TIP #112: When determining the number of inventory locations
(D/Cs) in your supply chain, you must look at the total cost of
inventory and the impact on customer service.
TIP #113: Inventory stockouts have a negative impact on your
transportation costs. Eliminating/reducing those (stockouts) will
reduce transportation and handling costs.
TIP #114: Stockouts result in back-orders or customer order can-
cellations. Order cancellations can result in lost customers, and
back-orders result in higher transportation costs.
TIP #115: JIT delivery is an effective tool to keep inventory levels
low, but if your supply partner doesn’t deliver quality product on
schedule, it can cause a host of irrevocable problems.
TIP #116: If inventory sits in your warehouse unused for a long
period of time, get rid of it. It’s taking up space that can be used
for active inventory or for some other activity.

450

Rightsizing Inventory
TIP #117: Rather than looking to automate the movement of
inventory, focus your efforts on eliminating inventory so there is
no inventory to move.
TIP #118: Do not pick components for ﬁnal assembly until you
are assured that all components are available in inventory.
TIP #119: You cannot sell products without managing inventory to
some degree, and you cannot manage inventory effectively without
knowing what inventory you have and what inventory you need.
Cycle counting addresses the issue of what inventory you have.
TIP #120: High levels of inventory hide many business problems
you may not even be aware of. Reduce the level of inventory in
your supply chain to expose your business problems.
TIP #121: In order to determine your inventory record accuracy,
you must ﬁrst decide on a meaningful performance metric and
communicate it to all links in your supply chain.
TIP #122: Don’t be lulled into a false sense of security with
inventory accuracy in the mid-90s. The probability of a combination
of parts being available when needed is still at risk.
TIP #123: Don’t spend a great deal of time analyzing tolerances
for each part number. Pick some reasonable percentage and start
there. You can make adjustments as necessary.
TIP #124: Consider outsourcing your reverse logistics function if
it is not part of your core competency, or you lack the resources
to properly dispose of returned goods.
TIP #125: When dealing with multiple inventory systems in your
supply chain, you must identify which one is the primary inventory
reporting system for the entire supply chain.
TIP #126: The timing of inventory transaction reporting into the
system is critical to maintaining accurate inventory records.
TIP #127: Although inventory reporting may be tracked separately
for different supply-chain links, it should be aggregated into one
system to monitor performance against company strategic and
tactical plans.
TIP #128: Inventory must be reported by its current location in
your supply chain so that you can effectively rightsize your inven-
tory across supply-chain links.
TIP #129: Information technology is responsible for inventory data
integrity once it is reported to the system. However, the actual
transactions of inventory movement (physical movement) are the
responsibility of the appropriate supply-chain link.
TIP #130: Do not attempt to modify or customize the inventory
management applications within your ERP system until you truly
identify a real need to change it.

Appendix B: TIPS on How to “Rightsize” Inventory

451
TIP #131: Do not attempt to implement sophisticated technologies
to help you rightsize your inventory until you have built a basic
foundation of inventory management processes and procedures.
TIP: #132: Buying and selling inventory (products) over the Inter-
net (through a Web site) can speed up the sales cycle, increase
sales, and increase inventory turnover, but there are pitfalls to
overcome.
TIP #133: Replacing inventory with information will greatly
enhance the opportunity to rightsize your inventory.
TIP #134: Application software implementations should be man-
aged by the supply-chain link most impacted by the application.
TIP #135: If you have a ﬁeld service division, get it involved in
your inventory rightsizing efforts; it has a lot to contribute.
TIP #136: Field service can help reduce inventory by assisting
product design with the reduction of parts in your product.
TIP #137: Consolidating spare parts inventory into fewer locations
can reduce the overall amount of inventory carried, without having
a negative impact on customer service.
TIP #138: Field service may share resources with other links in
your supply chain. By combining resources you may be able to
save money and improve operating efﬁciency.
TIP #139: Individual performance measures (related to inven-
tory) should be replaced by shared, team-based performance
measurements.
TIP #140: Education and training has to be an important part of
your inventory rightsizing effort.
TIP #141: Human resources can take a proactive role in your
inventory rightsizing effort by raising the visibility of the inventory
effort through formal company communication channels.
TIP #142: Get your maintenance team involved in performing
proactive maintenance. This will greatly enhance your chances to
rightsize your inventory.
TIP #143: Maintenance personnel should be part of a cross-
functional team committed to reducing machine setup times.
TIP #144: Reducing machine setup times will increase capacity,
reduce lead times, and decrease lot sizes, which could ultimately
lead to increased sales and proﬁts for the company.
TIP #145: Get facilities management involved in your “good house-
keeping” activities. It can contribute to the improved visibility of
inventory, which is an important criterion in your inventory right-
sizing efforts.
TIP #146: Don’t focus your efforts on ﬁnding new space to put
inventory. Focus your efforts on better utilization of the space you

452

Rightsizing Inventory
already have. Better yet, get rid of your inventory so you don’t
need the space.
TIP #147: Facilities management can help protect inventory from
being damaged during storage and internal movement through
your supply chain.
TIP #148: Avoid the ten most common mistakes of rightsizing your
inventory.
TIP #149: To successfully rightsize inventory the effort must be
sustained indeﬁnitely on a continuous basis.
TIP #150: A strong, healthy company culture will be an asset to
rightsizing your inventory. A weak, sick company culture will be
a liability to rightsizing your inventory.
