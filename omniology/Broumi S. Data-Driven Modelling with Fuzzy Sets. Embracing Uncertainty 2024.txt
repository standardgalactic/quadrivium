Data‑Driven Modelling  
with Fuzzy Sets
Lotfi Zadeh introduced in 1965 the theory of fuzzy sets, in which truth 
values are modelled by numbers in the unit interval [0, 1], for tackling 
mathematically the frequently appearing in everyday life partial truths. In 
a second stage, when membership functions were reinterpreted as possibil‑
ity distributions, fuzzy sets were extensively used to embrace uncertainty 
modelling. Uncertainty is defined as the shortage of precise knowledge or 
complete information and possibility theory is devoted to the handling of 
incomplete information. Zadeh articulated the relationship between pos‑
sibility and probability, noticing that what is probable must preliminarily 
be possible. Following Zadeh’s fuzzy set, various generalizations (intuition‑
istic, neutrosophic, rough, soft sets, etc.) have been introduced enabling a 
more effective management of all types of the existing in real‑world uncer‑
tainty. This book presents recent theoretical advances and applications of 
fuzzy sets and their extensions to Science, Humanities and Education.
This book,
•	 Presents a qualitative assessment of big data in the education sector 
using linguistic Quadri partitioned single‑valued neutrosophic soft 
sets.

Preface
Fuzzy sets have been widely used to represent imprecise and fuzzy infor‑
mation in the real world. Although they are effective in dealing with such 
data, their capability to handle incomplete and inconsistent information is 
restricted. Recently, several extensions of fuzzy sets have attracted attention 
because of their improved versatility.
This book, entitled Data‑Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets: Embracing 
Uncertainty, explores theories and advancements in the field. It also exam‑
ines the wide‑ranging applications of various extensions of fuzzy sets the‑
ory. Additionally, the book delves into the practical applications of fuzzy 
sets in knowledge management, including evaluating student learning abili‑
ties, assessing academic performance and screening technical articles.
The information in this extensive resource is designed to be beneficial for 
mathematicians, physicists, computer experts, engineers, scholars, practi‑
tioners and students who want to enhance their knowledge of fuzzy sets 
and their practical applications in various fields.
The book contains 16 chapters that address a wide range of topics, all in 
line with the bookʼs overall vision. Each chapter provides valuable insights 
into the study of fuzzy set theory and its extensions, as well as exploring 
their applications in various fields. Here is a brief overview of the findings 
presented in the chapters:

Integrated fuzzy soft 
FCM approach in focused 
decision‑making
Priya R. and Nivetha Martin
1.1  INTRODUCTION
Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are the decision‑making tools developed by 
Kosko [1] to make optimal decisions with uncertain data. FCMs are the 
extensions of cognitive maps introduced by Robert Axelord [2]. An FCM 
is a graphical representation of the factors concerned with the decision‑­
making problem, and the causal effects between the factors are profoundly 
explored based on manual or computational methods.
The development of FCM based on manual methods requires an expert’s 
knowledge of the basics of FCM and the background of the problem. The 
choice of the experts has to be made on the grounds of competency and 
efficacy. Another kind of development of the FCM model is using compu‑
tational methods that require less human intervention. The computation 
methods comprise algorithmic approaches under automated and semi‑­
automated models.
Construction of the FCM model requires factors and their inter‑­relational 
impacts, which are represented as nodes and edges of a directed graph, 
respectively. Edge weights signify the degree of association between the fac‑
tors and are represented by 1, 0 and −1 to denote the positive, null and 
negative natures of associations, respectively. An FCM with such discrete 
weights is termed as simple, and if the degree of association belongs to [−1, 1],  
then the FCM is defined as weighted. Thus, the type of edge weight ­values 
classifies FCM.
FCMs have varied applications in several fields, especially in obtaining 
optimal decisions. Researchers have applied FCM in different domains, 
to mention a few, Markinos et al. [3] in agriculture, Papageorgiou and 
Salmeron [4] in modeling systems, Sapkota and Karwowski [5] in pre‑
diction, Napoles et al. [6] in simulation, Murungweni et al. [7] in liveli‑
hood analysis, Mendonca et  al. [8] in industrial applications and Liu 
et al. [9] in risk factor analysis. FCMs are extended to intuitionistic FCM 
(IFCM), neutrosophic FCM and plithogenic FCM. In IFCM,  the  edge 

2  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
weights are represented using intuitionistic sets. IFCMs are also widely 
applied in various decision‑making environments—Papageorgiou et al. 
[10], Iakovidis and Papageorgiou [11] in medical analysis, Hajek and 
Prochazka [12] in supplier selection, Buyukozkan and Gocer [13] in 
risk analysis, Habibollah et  al. [14] in supply chain management and 
Hajek et  al. [15] in multi‑criteria decision‑making. Another exten‑
sion of this kind is ­neutrosophic cognitive maps (NCMs) in which the 
association between the factors is determined by indeterminate values. 
Smarandache  & Vasantha Kandasamy [16] have introduced NCM. 
Researchers have applied NCM in various fields. To mention a few, Aasim 
et  al. in the situation analysis, Martin et  al. [17] in lifestyle diseases 
analysis, Kalaichelvi and Gomathy [18] and Vasantha et al. [19] in social 
problems, William et al. [20] in medical diagnosis, Al‑Subhi et al. [21] in 
project management, Ramkumar et al. [22] and Ramalingam et al. [23] 
in COVID-19 diagnosis.
Plithogenic cognitive maps (PCMs) are the recent extension of NCM, 
and it is the generalization of FCM and IFCM. Smarandache and Martin 
[24] have introduced PCM. Martin et al. [25] have also introduced induced 
PCM, plithogenic sub‑cognitive maps. PCM is also used by researchers 
to study COVID-19. The above‑stated varied types of cognitive maps dif‑
fer by their edge weight representations. Also, in all these types of cog‑
nitive maps represented in the Fuzzy, Intuitionistic, neutrosophic and 
plithogenic environments, each factor is associated with other factors, 
and the cause‑and‑effect interrelations are expressed. The factors of the 
decision‑making problem are compared with one another in a very com‑
prehensive manner. For instance, in conventional types, the causal impact 
of one factor over another is expressed in a very general manner, but the 
nature of the impact is not specified and discussed so far. It is quite very 
natural that the association between the factors has to be narrowed down 
at times of focused decision‑making. The specificity in the associations is 
very much essential to studying the real impacts of the factors. To facilitate 
focused decision‑making, a new kind of FCM with a soft sets approach 
is introduced. Soft sets are introduced by Molodtsov [26]. Fuzzy soft sets 
introduced by Atanassov et  al. [27] have several applications in making 
optimal decisions. Researchers like Cagman et al. [28], Kong et al. [29], Liu 
et al. [30], Kazancı et al. [31], Roy and Maji [32], and Sut [33] have applied 
fuzzy soft sets in various decision‑making scenarios. Fuzzy soft sets are 
also extended to intuitionistic, neutrosophic and plithogenic soft sets just 
as fuzzy cognitive maps.
This book introduces the fuzzy soft approach in fuzzy cognitive 
maps and applies it in focused decision‑making. This new approach has 
changed the representation of the connection matrix. In this new type 
of FCM, the connection matrix representing the associational impact 

Integrated fuzzy soft FCM approach in focused decision‑making  3
between the factors has space for specificity, and the nature of the impact 
is also reflected. Just as fuzzy soft sets establish the relationship between 
the elements and the attributes, in this new type of FCM with fuzzy soft 
sets approach, the associational impacts of a factor over another factor 
are discussed under various phenomena that are considered the attributes 
as in fuzzy soft sets, and also, the representations are made as in fuzzy 
soft sets.
The fuzzy soft sets integrated with FCM decision models provide space 
for narrowing down the decision‑making, whereas the earlier FCM models 
are very comprehensive and lack the space for specificity in decision‑­making. 
The advantage of the proposed decision‑making model is substantiated by a 
focused decision‑making problem on the institutional initiatives toward the 
holistic growth of the students in the post‑pandemic period. In this decision‑ 
making problem, in addition to the factors of the problem, the nature of 
the problem is also taken into consideration. Here, the problem is circum‑
scribed around holistic growth, and this is defined in five dimensions, 
namely Physical, Emotional, Social, Spiritual and Mental. The associa‑
tional impacts between the factors of the problem are analyzed concerning 
the five dimensions of holistic growth rather than considered in a general 
sense. The decision‑making is focused on the sense that the association 
between the factors of the problem is analyzed with a special focus on the 
five dimensions of holistic growth. This kind of analysis of the associational 
impacts will certainly facilitate in making focused ­decision‑making about 
the factors of the decision‑making problem. This kind of decision‑making 
model also provides opportunities to make decisions in general and particu‑
lar dimensions.
The chapter is structured into five sections. Section 1.2 presents a brief 
description of the fuzzy soft sets‑integrated FCM decision models; Section 
1.3 applies the proposed model to a focused decision‑making problem; 
Section 1.4 consists of results and discussions and Section 1.5 concludes 
the chapter.
1.2  INTEGRATED FUZZY SOFT SETS FCM
FCMs are directed graphs consisting of edges, nodes and edge weights. The 
edge weight values decide the nature of FCM. The concept, terminology 
and methodology of FCM are explained by the following example.
Let us consider a decision–making problem with four factors. The factors 
are considered as the nodes, and their association is represented as the edges 
of a directed graph. Let the factors be F1, F2, F3 and F4. The graphical 
representation of the association shall be represented from the connection 
matrix as shown in Figure 1.1.

4  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
In FCM, the fixed point is determined by the following procedure with 
the intervention of a few terms. An instantaneous vector is of the form (1 0 
0 0 0 0…0) stating the ON and OFF positions of the factors. Let us consider 
the first factor in the ON position, then the instantaneous vector takes the 
form of (1 0 0 0). This vector is passed onto the connection matrix M and 
the resulting vector will be (0 1 1 1). The vector obtained is the threshold 
by assigning 1 to the values of the vector greater than 1 and 0 to the values 
lesser than 1. The value 1 is also assigned to the corresponding ON position 
of the factor. The updated vector is (1 1 1 1). Now, the same vector is passed 
onto the connection matrix M, the resultant updated vector is (1 1 1 1)  
which is the same as the earlier obtained threshold vector. This vector is 
said to be the fixed point of this dynamical fuzzy system. The observation 
from the vector clearly states the first factor has associations with all other 
factors. From this vector, we obtain the association only in a general sense. 
The connection matrix consists of simple edge weights. The edge weights 
shall be varied by assigning weighted edge weights [−1, 1], linguistic vari‑
ables with fuzzy quantifications. In these ways, the connection matrix gets 
modified. But in all these modifications, the associational impacts between 
the factors are determined only in a general sense but not the impacts with 
specificity between the factors. To make it so, the fuzzy soft set approach

is integrated with FCM. The same problem of finding the associational 
impacts shall be discussed under three dimensions, in that case, three con‑
nection matrices will be obtained concerning each dimension and that will 
be of the form.
The values a1, a2 and a3 represent the associational impacts of C1 over 
C2 concerning the dimensions D1, D2 and D3, respectively. The ai values 
shall be crisp, fuzzy, intuitionistic, neutrosophic and linguistic. This shall 
be represented as fuzzy soft sets in the following manner. The associational 
impacts of C1 over other factors are as follows:
	
{C2/{a1,a2,a3}, C3/{a4,a5,a6}, C4/{a7,a8,a9}}
The connection matrix comprising associational impacts with specific‑
ity shall be split into three connection matrices pertaining to each of the 
dimensions.
The same procedure of FCM shall be obtained to find the associational 
impacts between one factor over another concerning the D1 dimension, and 
this facilitates focused decision‑making. In a similar fashion, the connec‑
tion matrices concerning other dimensions and the associational impacts 
concerning D2 and D3 shall be determined as in Table 1.1.
The general representation of the factors with fuzzy soft sets integration 
for making focused decisions is given with Ai factors and Ej dimensions as 
in Table 1.2.
1.3  FOCUSED DECISION‑MAKING ON 
INSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVES TOWARD 
HOLISTIC GROWTH OF THE STUDENTS 
IN THE POST‑PANDEMIC PERIOD
In this section, the proposed integrated decision‑making model is validated 
with a decision‑making problem on institutional initiatives toward the 
holistic growth of students in the post‑pandemic period. Generally, every 
institution is striving hard to foster the holistic growth of their students 
by triggering several new initiatives. If holistic growth is the main focus, 
then the institutions must be well aware of the five dimensions of holistic

growth namely, Physical Emotional, Social, Spiritual and Mental. The ini‑
tiatives that are taken by the institution must cater to all these dimensions 
of the students to channel the path for promoting holistic growth. All the 
initiatives that are proposed by an institution shall not be put into practice 
due to internal and external constraints, also the conditions of feasibility 
add on to it. Henceforth, the initiatives are to be ranked concerning their 
inter‑associational impacts on the dimensions too, and this has routed out 
focused decision‑making. The institutional initiatives are considered as the 
factors of the focused decision‑making problem.
A1 – Creating exposure to students on the recent academic endeavors 
institutionalized by higher educational institutions
A2 – Building ambiance in for dents to accommodate the changes in 
educational technology
A3  –  Conducting programs catering to the skill development of the 
students
A4 – Reinforcing the students with moral values and ethical principles
A5 – Facilitating a conducive environment for the personality develop‑
ment of the student community
A6 – Arranging counseling and mentoring sessions to overcome the stu‑
dent’s hitches
A7 – Lessening academic burdens with much focus on practical training 
and experience
A8 – Initiating interactive classes with various academic experts through 
networking
A9 – Framing of curriculum meeting the present demands of the students
A10 – Involving students in various cultural and other relishing activities 
to refresh and revive them
The comprehensive connection matrix comprising the associational impacts 
concerning the five dimensions of holistic growth is given in Table 1.3.
The above connection matrix shall be expressed like fuzzy soft sets rep‑
resentation. In this case, the dimensions are considered as the attributes 
{E1, E2, E3, E4, E5}, and the universal set comprises the factors {A1, A2, 
…A10}.
The fuzzy soft representations of the connection matrix between the 
­factors concerning the dimensions are as in Table 1.4.
The connection matrices concerning various dimensions of holistic 
growth of the student community can be derived from the above compre‑
hensive matrix. The connection matrix concerns the Physical dimension of 
the holistic growth of the student community.
Connection matrix of the Physical dimension of the holistic growth of the 
student community is given in Table 1.5.

10  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
The connection matrix with respect to the Mental dimension of the holis‑
tic growth of the student community is given in Table 1.9.
Based on the computations as discussed in Section 1.2, the factors are 
ranked with respect to the dimensions of the holistic growth of the student 
community, and it is presented in Table 1.10.
The ranking results of the factors by considering different dimensions 
are presented in Table 1.10. Let us assume the case of ranking the factors 
without taking into account the dimension discrimination. The conven‑
tional connection matrix that represents the associational impacts between 
the factors without dimensional discrimination is presented as follows:

Integrated fuzzy soft FCM approach in focused decision‑making  13
The edge weights representing the associational impacts between the fac‑
tors take into account all the dimensions. By using the algorithmic approach 
of FCM, the factors are ranked in Table 1.11.
1.4  DISCUSSIONS
The ranking of the factors with (E1, E2, E3, E4, E5) and without (G) dimen‑
sional discrimination is presented in Figure 1.2. Here, the notation of G 
represents the considerations of the dimensions without discrimination, it 
means the total effects of the factors over one another are considered. The 
ranking results of the factors with and without dimensional discrimination 
presented graphically shall be interpreted in the following manner. Let us 
consider factor A1, it occupies Rank 7 in the case of without dimensional 
discrimination, and in the case of dimensional discrimination, it occupies 
Ranks 4, 3, 2, 10 and 6 when the physical, emotional, social, spiritual and 
mental dimensions of the holistic growth of student community are consid‑
ered, respectively. In this way, the ranking of other factors shall be analyzed.

1.5  CONCLUSION
This research work introduces a new form of representation in FCM. The 
proposed integrated fuzzy soft FCM is applied in focused decision‑making, 
and this has paved the way for making decisions in considering various fac‑
ets of decision‑making concept. This model shall be extended by incorpo‑
rating a hyper soft set approach which shall accommodate more attributes 
and sub‑attributes.

Optimal ranking application 
of integrated fuzzy 
AHP‑SPOTIS MCDM
Nivetha Martin
2.1  INTRODUCTION
Decision‑making is one of the deliberate activities that takes place at all 
phases of production processes. Supplier selection is one of the crucial 
steps of the pre‑production phases as it plays a significant role in enhancing 
the quality of production. As the attribute of quality is an expected vital 
component in the perspective of the consumers, the decision‑makers must 
make an optimal selection of the suppliers to produce quality products. 
Researchers have applied several multi criteria decision making (MCDM) 
methods to supplier selection problems. A decision‑making problem in sup‑
plier selection is characterized by alternatives, criteria and suitable method 
of ranking the alternatives. In every decision‑making environment, there 
are two ways of assuming the criterion weights: one is equal criterion 
weights and the other is unequal criterion weights. If the significance of all 
the criteria is considered equal, then the criterion weights are assumed to 
be equal. If the criteria are graded based on their significance, then the cri‑
terion weights are assumed to be unequal. The objectives of every MCDM 
method are to find the criterion weights and to rank the alternatives. Some 
of the MCDM methods are exclusively applied to find the criterion weights, 
especially AHP, CRITIC and a few other methods of this kind also exist in 
the literature. Some of the other MCDM methods developed by researchers 
to rank the alternatives are TOPSIS, VIKOR, MARICA and many others.
In general, a decision‑making environment cannot be defined under deter‑
ministic conditions at all times as the criteria satisfaction rate of the alterna‑
tives cannot be specified by discrete values at all instances. This is the point 
where the concept of uncertainty creeps as an obstacle in formulating the 
initial decision‑making matrix. The problem of uncertainty is resolved by 
the notion of fuzzy sets introduced by Zadeh [1]. Fuzzy integrated MCDM 
methods are more viable and compatible in comparison to deterministic 
MCDM methods under a crisp environment, as the former leavens the 
complexity in handling uncertain data. Supplier selection problems are 
also discussed under a fuzzy environment, and the method of Fuzzy AHP 
(FAHP) is used predominantly to determine the criterion weights along 

18  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
with the common ranking methods such as TOPSIS, VIKOR, MOORA, 
DEMATEL and many other. On analyzing the research works on supplier 
selection, the application of new methods under a fuzzy environment is not 
explored except with very few repeated combinations of FAHP with other 
ranking methods. This has motivated the authors to develop a combination 
of FAHP and fuzzy SPOTIS ranking methods to solve the decision‑making 
problem in supplier selection.
In this research work, an integrated MCDM method is developed with 
the introduction of the fuzzy SPOTIS method and the application of the 
proposed method to the decision‑making problem on the supplier selection 
of cattle feed is presented with real data sets. The remaining content is pre‑
sented as follows: Section 2.2 comprises the literature review of the applica‑
tions of FAHP integrated with other MCDM methods in supplier selection, 
Section 2.3 sketches the methodology of the proposed method, Section 2.4 
applies the proposed method to the decision‑making problems on supplier 
selection of cattle feed, Section 2.5 discusses the results of the findings and 
the last section concludes the chapter with future scope of the research work
2.2  LITERATURE REVIEW
This section presents the applications of Fuzzy AHP integrated with other 
MCDM methods of ranking in supplier selection. As the contributions of FAHP 
are many in number, the literature review is limited to very recent research 
works. The method of fuzzy AHP is commonly applied in supplier selection 
problems subjected to various domains and Table 2.1 presents the same.
The method of FAHP is also integrated with other ranking MCDM 
methods to rank the suppliers. The contributions of the researchers in this 
aspect are shown in Table 2.2.

Optimal ranking application  19
From Table 2.2, it is clear that the method of FAHP is widely applied 
in almost all fields of decision‑making. To the best of our knowledge, the 
method of FAHP is not integrated with the method of SPOTIS.
The MCDM method of SPOTIS introduced by Dezert et al. [34] is one of the 
MCDM methods with less complexity and it best fits into the MCDM charac‑
terization. This method is free from rank reversal, and it defines the bounds of 
the score values of the criteria to facilitate the comparison of the alternatives 
with the ideal solution. The MCDM problems without the bounds of the crite‑
rion score values are termed as ill‑defined MCDM, and this method of SPOTIS 
helps in finding optimal solutions to such types of problems. The method of 
SPOTIS is applied to make decisions on any kind of decision‑­making prob‑
lem, but this method is discussed only under a crisp sense i.e., if the criterion 
values are deterministic in nature, but what happens if the criterion values are

represented as linguistic variables with fuzzy quantification. In this case, the 
bounds of each of the criterion are obtained using α‑cuts. The development of 
fuzzy SPOTIS with α‑cut bound values of the criteria is the novel approach of 
this research work. Also, the method of FAHP is not integrated with SPOTIS, 
and henceforth in this chapter, an integrated FAHP & FSPOTIS is developed 
to make optimal decisions on supplier selection problem.
2.3  METHODOLOGY
In this section, the steps involved in the methods of Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) and 
Fuzzy SPOTIS are presented. Figure 2.1 presents the overall flow chart of 
the integrated method. As the steps involved in FAHP are well presented in 
[35–37], the previous flow chart includes the algorithm of FAHP.

2.4  APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED INTEGRATED 
METHOD IN SUPPLIER SELECTION
In this section, the proposed integrated FAHP & FSPOTIS is applied to the 
decision‑making problem on supplier selection of cattle feed.
2.4.1  Problem definition
Cattle feed is one of the essential factors of livestock productivity. The ade‑
quate supply and the quality of cattle feed is very much needed for increasing 
the production of milk and milk products. In general, every farm manager 
will consider the criteria of cost and quality as important in choosing the 
suppliers. But on intense analysis, the aspects of reliability, delivery service, 

22  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
accessibility and flexibility should also be taken into account for the long 
run of business relationships. Hence, the farm managers are constrained 
by the challenges of making optimal decisions on the choice of suppliers of 
cattle feed subjected to several core criteria. In this section, the proposed 
method in Section 2.3 is applied to the data on suppliers of cattle feed col‑
lected from the livestock farms in the regions of Karumathur, Chellampatti 
block of Madurai district using the questionnaire tool.
The criteria considered for the supplier selection are as follows:
SSC1: Price
SSC2: Quality
SSC3: Accessibility
SSC4: Delivery Performance
SSC5: Reliability
SSC6: Flexibility
The above six criteria are classified into two groups, namely benefit criteria 
(BC) and cost criteria (CC) and it is given in Table 2.3.
The criterion weights obtained using FAHP are given in Table 2.4.
The criterion‑bound values based on the performance magnitude are 
determined using fuzzy representations for each of the linguistic variables

2.5  DISCUSSION
The ranking results shall be obtained by repeating the above steps for dif‑
ferent values of α. The bound values of the criteria for different values of α 
are shown in Table 2.10.
The score values of the alternatives for various values of α are shown in 
Table 2.11.
From Table 2.10, it is found that the score values obtained for different 
values of α yield the same ranking results of the alternatives. Let us repeat 
the same procedure by considering different values of α to obtain different 
bounds for each of the criteria, for instance, to find the bounds of the cri‑
teria, the value of α for SSC1 is considered to be 0, 0.25 for SSC2, 0.5 for 
SSC3, 0.75 for SSC4 and 1 for SSC5 and SSC6. The bounds obtained for 
each criterion with respect to each of the α values are shown in Table 2.12
With the above consideration, the weighted score values are obtained for 
each of the alternatives as in Table 2.13.

26  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
The above procedure shall be applied with different α sets for each cri‑
terion. This attempt is made to rank the alternatives with different bound 
values of the criteria based on the choice of the ‘α’ values. The obtained 
bound values based on the choice of the ‘α’ values indicate the expected per‑
formance rate of each criterion from the perspective of the decision‑makers. 
The ranking results obtained by considering criterion bound values with 
the same values of α differ from that of the results obtained by considering 
bound values with different α sets. The occurrences of such differences in 
the ranking results are quite natural, and it is subjected to the expectations 
of the decision‑maker.
2.6  CONCLUSION
This chapter proposes the FSPOTIS which is an extended fuzzy version of 
the SPOTIS MCDM. This newly developed method integrated with FAHP 
is applied in ranking the suppliers of cattle feed. The method of FSPOTIS is 
discussed under several considerations of α values. This integrated method 
is robust in nature and also it is realistic as it deals with a linguistic deci‑
sion matrix. This research work has good scope as the proposed method 
of FSPOTIS shall be integrated with other MCDM methods of criterion 
weight computation. The efficacy of the proposed method shall be tested 
using other MCDM methods.

Chapter 3
Parametric decision‑making 
in a fuzzy environment
Michael Gr. Voskoglou
3.1  INTRODUCTION: THE 
DECISION‑MAKING PROCESS
Problems appear frequently in everyday life having more than one feasible 
solution, i.e. solutions satisfying all the constraints related to the problem’s 
data, as well as all the natural constraints imposed by the environment. For 
example, if x denotes the quantity of a good and the problem states that the 
stock of this good must not exceed 50 units, a feasible solution must satisfy 
the inequality 0 ≤ x ≤50.
Decision‑making (DM) is the process of obtaining, with the help of a 
suitable criterion, the problem’s optimal solution, i.e. the best among its 
feasible solutions. The choice of the corresponding criterion is usually not 
unique, depending upon the decision‑maker’s desired goals, e.g. an optimis‑
tic or a conservative criterion, etc.
DM is a fundamental process in a great variety of human activities. The 
rapid technological progress, the sudden changes in the status of the local 
and international economic environment, the globalization of modern soci‑
ety and other related reasons led to a continuously increasing complexity of 
everyday life problems. As a result, the DM process becomes in many cases 
a very difficult task, so that it is impossible to be based on the decision‑mak‑
er’s experience, intuition and skills only, as it happened in earlier times. 
From the beginning of the 1950s, a progressive development started of a 
systematic methodology for the DM process which is based on Probability, 
Statistics, Economics, Psychology, etc., and is termed Statistical Decision 
Theory (SDT) (Liese & Miescke, 2008).
Many books have been written for helping decision‑makers to make 
smarter choices easier and quicker, e.g. (Barker, 2011, Heath & Heath, 
2013), etc. According to the nowadays existing standards, the DM process 
involves the following steps:

Parametric decision-making in a fuzzy environment  31
•	 d1: Analysis of the decision problem, i.e. understanding, simplify‑
ing and reformulating it in a way enabling the application of the DM 
process.
•	 d2: Collection and interpretation of all the necessary information 
related to the problem.
•	 d3: Determination of the problem’s feasible solutions.
•	 d4: Choice of the problem’s optimal solution (DM) with the help of the 
suitable, according to the decision‑maker’s goals, criterion.
•	 d5: Verification of the chosen decision on the basis of the results 
obtained by applying it in practice.
The last step d5, however, due to its depth and importance for administra‑
tive rationalism, is usually examined separately from the other steps of the 
DM process. Note that the first three steps of the DM process are con‑
tinuous in the sense that the completion of each one of them usually needs 
some time, during which the decision‑maker’s reasoning is characterized by 
transitions between hierarchically neighboring steps. Accordingly, the flow 
diagram of the DM process is represented in Figure 3.1.
In this chapter, extending a result of Maji et al. (2002), we develop a 
model of parametric DM using soft sets (SSs), grey numbers and neutro‑
sophic triplets as tools (Voskoglou, 2023). The rest of the chapter is orga‑
nized as follows: In Section 3.2, we study the process of DM under fuzzy 
conditions and we present an example solved with the help of the classical 
fuzzy DM criterion of Bellman & Zadeh (1970). Section 3.3 contains the 
mathematical background about neutrosophic sets, SSs and grey numbers, 
needed for the understanding of the rest of the chapter. Our parametric DM 
method is developed in Section 3.4 and the chapter closes with Section 3.5 
containing the final conclusions and hints for future research.
3.2  DECISION‑MAKING UNDER FUZZY CONDITIONS
Zadeh (1965) introduced the concept of fuzzy set (FS) for the purpose of 
tackling the existing in everyday life partial truths (e.g. almost true, rather 
pretty) and of expressing mathematical definitions having no clear bound‑
aries (e.g. high mountains, clever people)

32  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
Definition 3.1
Αn FS A on the universe U is defined as a set of the ordered pairs of 
the form
	
A = {(x, m(x)), x ∈ U}	
(3.1)
In Eq. (3.1) m: U → [0, 1] is the membership function of A and m(x) 
is called the membership degree of x in A, for all elements x of U. 
The closer m(x) to 1, the better x satisfies the characteristic property 
of A. For reasons of simplicity, many authors identify an FS with its 
membership function.
The membership function of an FS is obviously a generalization 
of the characteristic function of crisp sets. A disadvantage of FSs, 
however, is the existing difficulty in defining properly their member‑
ship functions. In fact, there is not any specific rule about this and 
the methods used are usually statistical or empirical, highly based 
on each observer’s personal criteria. For defining the FS of the high 
mountains, for example, one may consider as high all the moun‑
tains with heights greater than 2,500 m, whereas another one may 
consider all those with heights greater than 3,000 m. Consequently, 
the first observer will assign membership degree 1 to all mountains 
higher than 2,500 m, whereas the second one will assign member‑
ship degrees <1 to all mountains having heights between 2,500 and 
3,000 m. Analogous differences with respect to the two observers 
are expected to occur between the membership degrees of the other 
mountains as well. The only restriction for the definition of the mem‑
bership degree of an FS is to be compatible with the common logic; 
otherwise, the FS would not give a creditable description of the cor‑
responding real situation. This could happen, for example, in the 
previous case if one assigned membership degrees >0.5 to mountains 
with heights <500 m.
Most of the notions and operations on crisp sets are extended in a 
natural way to FSs.
Based on the concept of FS, Zadeh (1973) also introduced the infi‑
nite‑valued fuzzy logic (FL), in which the truth values are modelled by 
numbers in the unit interval [0, 1]. FL completes and extends the tra‑
ditional Aristotle’s (384–322 BC) bivalent logic (Kosko, 1993), which 
used to be for many centuries the basic tool of human reasoning, lead‑
ing to the growth of science and human civilization all this time
Uncertainty is defined as the shortage of precise knowledge or com‑
plete information on the data describing the state of a current situation. 

Parametric decision-making in a fuzzy environment  33
It was only in the second stage that FS theory and FL were used to 
embrace uncertainty modelling. This happened when membership 
functions were reinterpreted as possibility distributions (Zadeh, 1978, 
Dubois & Prade, 2001). Possibility theory is an uncertainty theory 
for handling incomplete information (Dubois & Prade, 2006). Zadeh 
(1978) clarified the relationship between possibility and probability, 
noticing that what is probable must preliminarily be possible.
Probability theory used for many years the unique tool in hands 
of the experts for dealing with problems connected to uncertainty. 
Probability, however, was proved to be sufficient only for tackling 
the cases of uncertainty that are due to randomness (Kosko, 1990). 
Randomness characterizes events with known outcomes which, how‑
ever, cannot be predicted in advance, e.g. the games of chance. FSs, 
apart from randomness, tackle also successfully the uncertainty due to 
vagueness, which is created when one is unable to distinguish between 
two properties, such as “a good student” and “a mediocre student”. 
For general facts on FSs, FL and the uncertainty connected to them, 
we refer to Klir & Folger (1988).
The DM problems are obviously connected with a degree of uncer‑
tainty. Moreover, in a variety of real‑life situations, DM takes place 
under fuzzy conditions because either the goals of the correspond‑
ing problems or/and the existing constraints are not clearly defined. 
Several methods and techniques for successful DM in the fuzzy envi‑
ronment have been reported in the literature, e.g. Bellman & Zadeh 
(1970), Alcantud (2018), Zhu & Ren (2022), etc. A typical form of a 
fuzzy DM problem involves its fuzzy goal G and a finite number of 
fuzzy constraints Ci, i = 1, 2, …, n. Such a problem is presented and 
solved in the following example:
Example 3.1
A company wants to employ the best among four candidates A, B, C 
and D (fuzzy goal G) under the fuzzy constraints that his salary will 
not be very high (C1) and that his residence will be in close driving dis‑
tance from the company’s offices (C2). The annual salary demands of the 
four candidates are 39, 35, 24 and 18 thousand euros, respectively. The 
company’s analysts, taking into account the candidates’ qualifications, 
expressed goal G and the constraints C1, C2 as FSs in the following form:
	
G = {(A, 0.9), (B, 0.8), (C, 0.6), (D, 0.5)},  
	
C1 = {(A, 0.1), (B, 0.3), (C, 0.6), (D, 1)}
	
C2 = {(A, 0.4), (B, 0.5), (C, 0.9), (D, 0.7)}.	
(3.2)

34  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
Which is the best choice for the company?
Solution: The universal set of the discourse here is the set U = {A, B, C, D}.  
According to the classical criterion of Bellman & Zadeh (1970) for DM 
in the fuzzy environment, the best company’s choice corresponds to the 
element of U with the greatest membership degree in the fuzzy decision 
F = G ∩ C1 ∩ C2 (intersection of FSs).
Let us denote by mG, 
1
mC , 
2
mC , mF the membership functions G, C1, 
C2 and F of the FSs, respectively. It is well known then (Klir & Folger,

Combining Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3), one obtains the following equation:
	
F = {(A, 0.1), (B, 0.3), (C, 0.6), (D, 0.5)}	
(3.4)
Therefore, the best choice for the company is the choice of Candidate C.
Remarks 3.1
	
i.	The application of the criterion of Bellman & Zadeh is not a unique 
way for tackling the DM problem of the previous example. Another 
logical approach, for instance, is to consider as fuzzy decision F, 
instead of the fuzzy intersection G ∩ C1 ∩ C2, the FS F with member‑
ship function,

Therefore, the best choice for the company is to employ Candidate D. 
Consequently, a disadvantage of fuzzy DM is that the best solution is 
not unique, depending on the definition of the corresponding mem‑
bership function.
	
ii.	The previous fuzzy DM model can be further extended to accom‑
modate the relative importance of the corresponding goals (which 
can be more than one) and constraints. This is achieved by attaching 
weighting coefficients to them, the sum of which must be equal to 1. 
Reconsider, for instance, Example 3.1 and assume that the company 
decides to attach the weighting coefficients 0.5, 0.2 and 0.3 to the goal 
G and the constraints C1 and C2 respectively. Then

(3.8)
Therefore, the best choice for the company in this case is to employ 
candidate A.
3.3  NEUTROSOPHIC SETS, SSS AND GREY NUMBERS
Following Zadeh’s FSs, several theories have been developed for the pur‑
pose of tackling more effectively all the forms of the existing uncertainty. 
The main among those theories are briefly reviewed in Voskoglou (2019). 
None of these theories, however, is suitable for tackling alone all the forms 
of the existing uncertainty, but the combination of all of them provides a 
sufficient framework for this purpose. Here, we present chosen elements 
from these theories which are needed for the understanding of the rest of 
the present chapter.
3.3.1  Neutrosophic sets
Atanassov (1986) added to Zadeh’s membership degree the degree of 
non‑membership and extended FS to the notion of intuitionistic FS (IFS). 
Smarandache (1998), inspired by the appearance in real‑life neutrali‑
ties – like <young, mature, old>, <small, medium, large>, etc. – extended in 
1995, the IFS to the concept of neutrosophic set (NS) by introducing the 
degree of indeterminacy or neutrality. The word “neutrosophy” is a syn‑
thesis of the words “neutral´ and the Greek “sophia” (wisdom) and means 
“the knowledge of neutral thought”. The simplest form of an NS is defined 
as follows:
Definition 3.2
A single‑valued NS (SVNS) A in the universe U is of the form
A = {(x, T(x), I(x), F(x)): x ∈ U, T(x), I(x), F(x) ∈ [0,1], 
0 ≤ T(x) + I(x) + F(x) ≤ 3}	
(3.9)
In Eq. (3.9), T(x), I(x) and F(x) are the degrees of truth (or member‑
ship), indeterminacy (or neutrality) and falsity (or non‑membership) 

36  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
of x in A, respectively, called the neutrosophic components of x. For 
simplicity, we write A < T, I, F>.
Indeterminacy is defined to be in general everything that exists 
between the opposites of truth and falsity (Smarandache, 2021).
Example 3.2
Let U be the set of the students of a class and let A be the SVNS of the 
good students of the class, then each student x is characterized by a 
neutrosophic triplet (t, i, f) with respect to A, with t, i, f in [0, 1]. For 
example, x(0.8, 0.1, 0.3) ∈ A means that there is a 70% belief that x is 
a good student, but at the same time, there exists a 10% doubt about 
it and a 30% belief that x is not a good student. In particular, x (0, 1, 
0) ∈ A means that we know absolutely nothing about the quality of 
student x (new student).
If the sum T(x) + I(x) + F(x) < 1, then it leaves room for incomplete 
information about x, if it is equal to 1 for complete information and if 
it is >1 for inconsistent (i.e. contradiction tolerant) information about 
x. An SVNS may contain simultaneously elements leaving room to all 
the previous types of information. All notions and operations defined 
on FSs are naturally extended to SVNSs (Wang et al., 2010).
The summation of neutrosophic triplets is equivalent to the union 
of NSs. That is why the neutrosophic summation and implicitly its 
extension to neutrosophic scalar multiplication can be defined in many 
ways, equivalently to the known literature neutrosophic union opera‑
tors (Smarandache, 2016). For the needs of the present work, writing 
the elements of an SVNS A in the form of neutrosophic triplets and 
considering them simply as ordered triplets, we define addition and 
scalar product as follows:
Definition 3.3
Let (t1, i1, f1), (t2, i2, f2) be in A and let k be a positive number. Then:
	
The sum (t1, i1, f1) + (t2, i2, f2) = (t1 + t2, i1 + i2, f1 + f2)		
(3.10)
	
The scalar product k(t1, i1, f1) = (kt1, k i1, kf1)	
	
(3.11)
Remark 3.2
The summation and scalar product of the elements of an SVNS A with 
respect to Definition 3.3 need not be a closed operation in A, since it 
may happen that (t1 + t2) + (i1 + i2) + (f1 + f2) > 3 or kt1 + k i1 + kf1 > 3. With 
the help of Definition 3.3, however, one can define in A the mean 
value of a finite number of elements of A as follows:

Parametric decision-making in a fuzzy environment  37
Definition 3.4
Let A be an SVNS and let (t1, i1, f1), (t2, i2, f2), …, (tk, ik, fk) be a finite 
number of elements of A. Assume that (ti, ii, fi) appears ni times in an 
application, i = 1, 2, …, k. Set n = n1 + n2 +… + nk. Then, the mean value 
of all these elements of A is defined to be

3.3.2  Soft sets
The existing difficulty of defining properly the membership function of an 
FS also holds for all the extensions of FSs involving membership degrees, 
like IFSs and NSs. To tackle this problem, the concept of interval‑valued FS 
(IVFS) was introduced in 1975. An IVFS is defined by mapping the universe 
U to the set of the closed subintervals of [0, 1] (Dubois & Prade, 2005). In 
rough set theory (Pawlak, 1991), the previous problem is overpassed by 
using instead of membership functions a pair of crisp sets giving the lower 
and the upper bounds of the original set, etc.
Molodtsov (1999) introduced the concept of SS for tackling uncertainty 
in a parametric manner, which, therefore, does not need too the use of a 
membership function. An SS is defined as follows:
Definition 3.5
Let E be a set of parameters, let A be a subset of E, and let f be a map 
from A into the power set P(U) of the universe U. Then, the SS (f, A) 
in U is defined as the set of the ordered pairs
	
(f, A) = {(e, f(e)): e ∈ A}	
	
	
	
	
(3.13)
The name “soft” is due to the fact that the form of (f, A) depends on the 
parameters of A. For each e ∈ A, its image f(e) in P(U) is called the value 
set of e in (f, A), while f is called the approximation function of (f, A).
Example 3.3
Let U = {P1, P2, P3} be a set of football players and let E = {e1, e2, e3} be the 
set of parameters e1 = good, e2 = fast and e3 = experienced. Let us further 
assume that P1, P2 are good, P3 is experienced and P2 and P3 are fast play‑
ers. Then, a map f: E → P(U) is defined by f(e1)  = {P1, P2}, f(e2) = {P2, P3} 
and f(e3) = {P3}. Therefore, the SS (f, E) in U is the set of the ordered pairs.
	
(f, E) = {(e1, {P1, P2}), (e2, {P2, P3}, (e3, {P3}}	
(3.14)

38  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
Maji et al. (2003) introduced a tabular representation of SSs in the 
form of a binary matrix in order to be stored easily in a computer’s 
memory. For example, the tabular representation of the SS (f, E) of the 
previous example is given in Table 3.1.
An FS in U with membership function y = m(x) is an SS in U of the 
form (f, [0, 1]), where f(α) = {x ∈ U: m(x) ≥ α} is the corresponding a‑cut 
of the FS, for each α in [0, 1]. Consequently, the concept of SS is a gen‑
eralization of the concept of FS. All notions and operations defined on 
FSs are extended in a natural way to SSs (Maji et al., 2003).
3.3.3  Grey numbers
The theory of grey systems (Deng, 1982) introduces an alternative way of 
managing the uncertainty in case of approximate data. A grey system is 
understood to be any system that lacks information, such as a structure 
message, operation mechanism or/and behavior document.
Closed real intervals are used for performing the necessary calculations 
in grey systems. In fact, a closed real interval [x, y] could be considered as 
representing a real number T, termed as a grey number (GN), whose exact 
value in [x, y] is unknown. We write then T ∈ [x, y]. A GN T, however, is 
frequently accompanied by a whitenization function f: [x, y] → [0, 1], such 
that, if f(a) approaches 1, then a in [x, y] approaches the unknown value of 
T. If no whitenization function is defined, it is logical to consider as a repre‑
sentative crisp approximation of the GN A the real number

(3.15)
The arithmetic operations on GNs are introduced with the help of the 
known arithmetic of the real intervals (Moore et al., 1995). In this work, 
we are going to make use only of the addition of GNs and of the scalar mul‑
tiplication of a GN with a positive number, which are defined as follows:
Definition 3.6
Let A ∈ [x1, y1], B ∈ [x2, y2] be two GNs and let k be a positive num‑
ber. Then:

(3.17)
3.4  PARAMETRIC DECISION‑MAKING
Maji et al. (2002) introduced a method of parametric DM by using SSs as 
tools and representing their tabular form as a binary matrix. When some 
or all of the parameters used for the characterization of the elements of the 
set of the discourse are of fuzzy texture (beautiful and cheap houses in their 
example), their method does not always give the best solution to the cor‑
responding DM problem. This happens because they replace the parameters 
in the tabular form of the corresponding SS with the binary elements 0, 1. 
In other words, their method, although it starts with a fuzzy framework 
(SSs), continues by using bivalent logic for obtaining the required decision, 
e.g. beautiful or not beautiful! In order to tackle this problem, we modified 
the method of Maji et al. by using either triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) 
(Voskoglou, 2022a) or GNs (Voskoglou, 2022b, Section 5.3) instead of the 
binary elements in the tabular form of the corresponding SS.
In everyday life, however, cases appear in which the decision‑maker 
has doubts about the correctness of the qualitative parameters assigned to 
some or all of the elements of the set of the discourse (e.g. very beautiful, 
rather beautiful, etc.). In order to study more efficiently the DM process in 
such cases, we introduced NSs and we replaced the binary elements of the 
method of Maji et al. by neutrosophic triplets (Voskoglou, 2023). Here, we 
present a parametric DM problem illustrating all the previous steps
3.4.1  The method of Maji et al.
Let us consider the following example:
Example 3.4
A company wants to choose a sales manager among six candidates, say 
S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6. The desired qualifications of the sales manager 
are to be well‑educated, younger than 40 years, having a driving license 
and experience. Assume that S1, S2 and S6 are the well‑educated candi‑
dates, S2, S3, S5 and S6 are the candidates being younger than 40 years, 
S3 and S5 are the candidates having a driving license and S4 is the unique 
experienced candidate. Which is the best choice for the company?
Solution: Let U be the set of the six candidates. Consider the param‑
eters e1 = well educated, e2 = younger than 40 years, e3 = with a driving 
license and e4 = experienced and set E = {e1, e2, e3, e4}. Define the map f: 
E → P(U) by f(e1) = {S1, S2, S6}, f(e2) = {S2, S3, S5, S6}, f(e3) = {S3, S5} and 
f(e4) = {S4}. Then, the tabular form of the SS (f, E) is shown in Table 3.2.

40  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
The choice value of each candidate is calculated by adding the binary 
elements of the row of Table 9.2 to which he belongs. Candidates S1 
and S4, therefore, have choice value 1 and all the others have choice 
value 2. Consequently, the right decision is to choose one of the candi‑
dates S2, S3, S5 or S6.
3.4.2  The decision‑making method using GNs
The previous decision, obtained by the method of Maji et al., is obviously 
not very helpful for the company. Observe, however, that the parameters e1 
and e4, in contrast to e2 and e3, have not a bivalent texture. A candidate, 
for example, could be rather well‑educated, or rather experienced, etc. This 
inspired us to characterize the candidates’ qualifications with respect to 
the parameters e1 and e4 in the tabular matrix of the SS (f, E) by using the 
linguistic grades A = excellent, B = very good, C = good, D = mediocre and 
F = not satisfactory instead of the binary elements 0, 1. To show how one 
works in this case for making the right decision, let us modify Example 3.4 
as follows:
Example 3.5
Reconsider Example 3.4 and assume that the analysts of the company, 
after a more careful inspection of the candidates’ qualifications, decided 
to use Table 3.3 instead of Table 3.2 for the DM process. Which is the 
best choice for the company in this case?
Solution: Assign to each of the qualitative grades A, B, C, D, F a 
GN, denoted for simplicity by the same letter, as follows: A = [0.85, 
1], B = [0.75, 0.84], C = [0.6, 0.74], D = [0.5, 0.59], F = [0, 0.49]. Then, 
from Table 3.3, one calculates, with the help of formulas (3.15), (3.16) 
and (3.17), the choice value of each candidate in the following way: S1: 
1 + V(C) = 1+ 
+
0.6
0.74
2
 = 1.67, S2: 2 + V(F) = 2.245, S3: 2 + V(2C) = 3.34, 
S4: 1 + V(D)= 1.545, S5: 2 + V(D + C) = 3.215, S6: 2 + V(D)=2.545. The 
right decision, therefore, is to choose the candidate S3.

Remark 3.3
The choice of the qualitative grades A, B, C, D, F, as well as of the 
intervals for translating them in the numerical scale 0 − 1, correspond 
to generally accepted standards. The decision‑maker, however, could 
use, with respect to his/her goals, more or less qualitative grades (e.g. 
by adding E between D and F, etc.) and could also change the cor‑
responding intervals (e.g. by setting A = [0.9, 1], B = [0.8, 0.89], C= 
[0.7, 0.79], D = [0.6, 0.69], F = [0, 0.59], or otherwise). Such changes, 
however, do not affect the generality of our method.
3.4.3  Neutrosophic decision‑making
When the decision‑maker has doubts about the correctness of the qualita‑
tive parameters assigned to some or all of the elements of the set of the dis‑
course, the best way to perform the DM process is to use NSs. In Example 
3.5, for instance, the decision‑maker could define in the universe U the 
NSs of the well‑educated and of the experienced candidates by assigning 
suitable neutrosophic triplets to each candidate. In order to have complete 
information, one must choose to have t + i + f = 1, for each triplet (t, i, f). 
Then, the decision‑maker could continue the DM process by replacing in 
Table 3.3 the qualitative grades by the corresponding neutrosophic triplets 
and the binary elements 0, 1 by the neutrosophic triplets (0, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 
0), respectively. This process is illustrated by Example 3.6.
Example 3.6
Reconsider Example 3.5 and assume that the analysts of the company, 
being not sure about the qualitative grades assigned to each of the six 
candidates, decided to proceed by replacing them by neutrosophic trip‑
lets. The tabular matrix of the DM process in these cases takes the 
form of Table 3.4. Which is the best decision for the company now?

42  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
Solution: The choice value of each candidate in this case is the mean 
value of the neutrosophic triplets of the line of Table 9.4 in which he 
belongs. Thus, by Eq. (3.12), the choice value of S1 is equal to 1
4
 [(1, 0, 
0) + 2(0, 0, 1) + (0.6, 0.3, 0.1)] = 1
4
 (1.6, 0.3, 2.1) = (0.4, 0.075, 0.525). In 
the same way, one finds that the choice values of S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 
are (0.55, 0.005, 0.4), (0.775, 0.15, 0.075), (0.375, 0.05, 0.575), (0.775, 
0.1, 0.125) and (0.6, 0.1, 0.3) respectively.
In this case, the company’s analysts could use either an optimistic 
criterion by choosing the candidate with the greatest truth degree or 
a conservative criterion by choosing the player with the lower falsity 
degree. Consequently, using the optimistic criterion, they must choose 
one of the candidates S3 and S5, whereas using the conservative crite‑
rion, they must choose Candidate S3. The combination of the two cri‑
teria, therefore, leads to the choice of candidate S3. Observe, however, 
that, since the indeterminacy degree of S3 is 0.15 and of S5 is 0.1, there 
is a slightly greater doubt about the qualifications of S3 with respect to 
the qualifications of S5. In other words, the choice of S3 is connected 
with a slightly greater risk.
3.5  FINAL CONCLUSIONS AND HINTS 
FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The goals and/or the existing constraints in several DM problems of every‑
day life are not clearly defined. As a result, the DM process in such cases 
takes place in the fuzzy environment. Several methods and techniques have 
been reported in the literature for DM under fuzzy conditions, and the pres‑
ent chapter is devoted to the solution of DM problems of such kind. The 
discussion performed here leads to the following conclusions:
•	 A serious disadvantage of FSs is that the definition of their mem‑
bership function is not unique depending on the personal beliefs of 
each observer. This disadvantage is transferred to the DM process 
under fuzzy conditions when the goals and /or the constraints of the

corresponding problem are expressed in the form of FSs. A popular 
DM method in this case is the application of the criterion of Bellman 
and Zadeh, according to which the optimal fuzzy decision is the 
intersection of all the problem’s goals and constraints. This method, 
however, is not unique, since several other logical approaches can be 
applied, which could lead to different results.
•	 In order to overcome this difficulty, Maji et al. proposed a parametric 
DM method, which is based on the introduction of a set E of param‑
eters characterizing the elements of the set U of all possible solutions 
of the corresponding DM problem, the definition with respect to E of 
a suitable SS in U and the use of its tabular representation T as a tool 
for the DM process.
•	 When some or all of the parameters of E, however, are not of binary 
(yes or no) but of fuzzy texture, the method of Maji et al. may not lead 
to the best decision. For this reason, we modified this method by replac‑
ing the binary elements of T corresponding to the fuzzy parameters by 
suitable GNs and by adding the remaining in each row of T binary ele‑
ments to the representative real values of the GNs appearing in it
•	 Further, when some or all of the parameters of E are of fuzzy texture, 
but the decision‑maker has doubts about the qualitative characteriza‑
tions assigned to the elements of U with respect to these parameters, 
we replaced all the elements of T by suitable neutrosophic triplets and 
we obtained the optimal decision by calculating the mean value of the 
neutrosophic triplets of the rows of T.
The results obtained in this and earlier author’s works give a strong indi‑
cation that hybrid methods applied to several situations in fuzzy environ‑
ments could give better results, not only for DM, as it happened here, but 
also for assessment – e.g. see Voskoglou (2022b), Section 5.2, Voskoglou 
et al. (2022), etc. – and probably for many other topics. This is, therefore, a 
promising area for further research.

Distance measures on 
trapezoidal intuitionistic 
fuzzy multi-numbers and 
application to multi-criteria 
decision-making problems
Irfan Deli and Hümeyra Karadöl
4.1  INTRODUCTION
Since the fuzzy sets [1] have a single membership value on [0, 1] for an 
element of the universe, it creates difficulties in the construction of some 
problems. Therefore, multi-fuzzy sets, which is a different generalization of 
fuzzy sets, were first developed on the multisets of Yager [2] by Miyamoto 
[3,4]. Then, Sebastian and Ramakrishnan [5] studied multi-fuzzy sub‑
groups and normal multi-fuzzy subgroups. The intuitionistic fuzzy multi‑
sets [7], as a generation of ordinary intuitionistic fuzzy sets [6] and fuzzy 
multisets [3,4], can express and process uncertainty much better. The intu‑
itionistic fuzzy multisets, characterized both by membership degrees and by 
non-membership degrees, is a more flexible way to cope with uncertainty. 
Therefore, Shinoj and John [7] generalized the concept of fuzzy multisets 
by using intuitionistic fuzzy sets, i.e., they proposed intuitionistic fuzzy 
multisets including basic operations such as union, intersection, addition, 
multiplication, etc. Moreover, Rajarajeswari and Uma [8,9] proposed 
some distance and similarity measures of intuitionistic fuzzy multisets and 
applied to medical diagnosis and pattern recognition problems. Das et al. 
[10] developed a different method for group multi-criteria decision-making 
under intuitionistic multi-fuzzy sets by constructing intuitionistic multi-
fuzzy matrices. Deepa [11] examined some new implication results related 
to intuitionistic fuzzy multisets. Fuzzy multisets and intuitionistic fuzzy 
multisets have gained much attention from past and later from researchers 
for applications in various fields as per Ref. [12–21].
Trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers [22], a fuzzy multiset on real numbers, 
have been studied in various fields in Ref. [22–25]. After the definition of 
trapezoidal fuzzy multi-number, Ulucay et al. Ref. [26] put forward trap‑
ezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy multi-numbers that are a special intuitionistic 
fuzzy multiset on real numbers that are more than one with the possibility 
of the same or the different membership and non-membership functions. 

Distance measures on trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers  47
As an extension of the trapezoidal fuzzy multi numbers, the trapezoidal 
intuitionistic fuzzy multi numbers is an effective tool for handling uncer‑
tainty and vagueness in decision-making problems. However, there are a 
few studies on trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy multi-numbers proposed by 
Ulucay et al. [26]. Therefore, in this study, we have developed a multi-­
criteria decision-making method under trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy 
multi-numbers. To do this, the notation of value and ambiguity of trap‑
ezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy multi-numbers based on (α, β)-cut sets are intro‑
duced. Then, some distance measures of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy 
multi-numbers by using the concept of (α, β)-cut sets, value and ambiguity 
are developed. Finally, a method is proposed and a practical application of 
the proposed approach is also illustrated to demonstrate its effectiveness 
and applicability. This chapter is derived from the second author’s master’s 
­thesis [27] supervised by the second author.

4.3  DISTANCE MEASURES OF TIFM-NUMBERS
In the section, we examined the cut sets of TIFM-numbers including some 
desired properties. So, we proposed the concept of value and ambiguity of 
TIFM-numbers based on the cut sets. Some of it is quoted/adopted and/or 
inspired and/or generalized from [22–27].

4.4  AN APPROACH TO MULTIPLE CRITERIA 
DECISION-MAKING WITH TIFM-NUMBERS
In this section, we developed an algorithm to solve some multi-criteria-
making problems by using TIFM-numbers based on proposed distance 
measures. Some of it is quoted/adopted and/or inspired and/or generalized 
from Refs. [22–26].

is called a TIFM–numbers multi-criteria decision matrix of the 
decision-maker.
In the following, an algorithm is given by using the proposed distance 
measures for the solution of multi-criteria decision-making problems (for 
which the criterion-based evaluation problems of the alternative) in which 
all data are expressed in measures. The linguistic terms given in Table 4.1 
were used to express the evaluation table in this algorithm within measures.

. Then, the character‑
istic of the alternative Xi on criteria uj is represented by the TIFM-numbers

following algorithms:

Trapezoidal fuzzy  
multi-aggregation operators based 
on Archimedean norms and their 
application to multi-attribute 
decision-making problems
Davut Kesen and Irfan Deli
5.1  INTRODUCTION
In 1965, the theory of fuzzy set was proposed by Zadeh [1] as a generaliza‑
tion of the classical set under ambiguous or uncertain information. In the 
proposed theory, elements can have a precise degree of membership or mem‑
bership functions that determine the membership degree of each element in 
a fuzzy set. Following the introduction of the theory, a few kinds of special 
fuzzy sets were proposed by many scientists on the real number set . For 
instance, Dijkman et al. [2] introduced some kind of fuzzy numbers contain‑
ing operations of fuzzy numbers. Dubois and Prade [3] reviewed works on 
fuzzy numbers proposed until then and they enlarged known operations 
on R to operations among fuzzy quantities. In the course of time, the sub‑
ject enlarged by scientists and some kind of fuzzy numbers were proposed 
and worked on. For example, Srinivasan et al. [4] submitted the median 
method as a new way to access the most optimal solution for a transporta‑
tion issue. Wang et al. [5] introduced the concept of discrete fuzzy num‑
bers with two dimensions that are based on the representation theorem. 
Yun et al. [6] introduced generalized triangular fuzzy numbers with some 
operations based on Zadeh’s extension principle. Dubois et al. [7] proposed 
new properties of probability-possibility transformation and proposed a jus‑
tification of symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. Rezvani [8] calculated the 
ranking of exponential trapezoidal fuzzy numbers based on variance. Then, 
Roseline and Amirtharaj [9] proposed a new method for ranking general‑
ized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and they also proposed a generalized fuzzy 
Hungarian method to get the initial solution to a transportation problem. 
We can find more study examples given about trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in 
Refs. [10–15] and triangular fuzzy numbers in Refs. [16–25].
Because some realizations have more than one probability of the differ‑
ent or same membership functions, Ulucay et al. [26] developed trapezoidal 
fuzzy multi-numbers on real numbers set  which are an extension of fuzzy 
numbers and multi-fuzzy sets by letting the repeated occurrences of any

element. Then, by defining the concept of value and ambiguity with α-cut 
sets of trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers, Keles [27] gave some similarity 
and distance measures on trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers and he intro‑
duced a multi-attribute decision-making problem under trapezoidal fuzzy 
multi-numbers based on proposed similarity and distance measures under 
cut sets. Sahin et al. [28] introduced a new multi-criteria decision-­making 
by defining dice vector similarity and weighted dice vector similarity mea‑
sure. Also, Sahin et al. [29] developed some similarity measures for trap‑
ezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers called weighted cosine similarity measure, 
hybrid vector similarity measure, Jaccard similarity measure, weighted 
Jaccard similarity measure, cosine similarity measure and weighted hybrid 
vector similarity measure. In 2020, Ulucay [30] defined new concepts of 
trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers such as similarity function and weighted 
similarity function. Then, Deli and Keles [31] described new distance mea‑
sures on trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers. In 2022, Kesen [32] introduced 
some arithmetic and geometric decision-making operators on trapezoidal 
fuzzy multi-numbers and applied these operators to multi-criteria decision-
making problems. Then, Kesen and Deli [33] introduced the weighted the 
Bonferroni harmonic mean operator on trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers 
and they applied the operator to a multi-criteria decision-making problem. 
In 2023, Sahin et al. [34] proposed a method by the centroid point of trap‑
ezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers for multi-criteria decision-making problems. 
Further, Deli and Kesen [35] introduced Bonferroni geometric mean opera‑
tor of trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers and they applied the operator to a 
multi-criteria decision-making problem.
In the course of the aggregation process, the selection of suitable opera‑
tional laws have a crucial role. The Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm supply 
a general rule of operational laws and more alternatives for decision-making. 
Until today, many kinds of t-conorm and t-norm have been derived from the 
Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm. For instance, Klir and Yuan [36] and 
Nguyen and Walker [37] proposed t-conorm and t-norm of the Algebraic, 
Einstein, Hamacher, Frank and so on. Based on Archimedean t-conorm and 
t-norm, Xia et al. [38] introduced Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm based 
intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic and weighted geometric operators. 
Zhang and Wu [39] introduced some Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm 
based interval-valued hesitant fuzzy weighted arithmetic and weighted geo‑
metric aggregation operators. Yu [40] came up with dual hesitant fuzzy 
weighted arithmetic and weighted geometric aggregation operators based on 
Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm operations in a dual hesitant fuzzy envi‑
ronment. Latter, Sarkar and Biswas [41] submitted Archimedean t-conorm 
and t-norm operations on Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy sets and gave a defini‑
tion of a collection of Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm based Pythagorean 
hesitant fuzzy weighted arithmetic and weighted geometric operators. In addi‑
tion to this, Sarkar and Biswas [42] gave an application of Archimedean 

Trapezoidal fuzzy multi-aggregation operators  95
t-conorm and t-norm on the interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy information 
and introduced a class of aggregation operators.
5.1.1  Novelty
As we know, no studies about Archimedean norms on trapezoidal fuzzy 
numbers have been conducted until now. Therefore, we proposed trapezoi‑
dal multi-fuzzy aggregation operators based on Archimedean t-conorm and 
t-norm. Then, we applied them to MADM-problems.
5.1.2  Motivation and contribution
	
1.	The given operators based on Archimedean norms are introduced to 
propose a new decision-making method for solving MADM-problems 
with trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers.
	
2.	The main aim is to develop ATS-TFMWA operator and ATS-TFMWG 
operator for MADM-problems with trapezoidal fuzzy multi-numbers.
	
3.	A method is constructed under MADM-problems with trapezoidal 
fuzzy multi-numbers.
	
4.	An example of an application is given to show the effectiveness and 
advantage of the introduced method.
5.1.3  Organization of paper
↓ In Section 5.2, we gave an introduction of some basic definitions and 
propositions.
↓ In Section 5.3, we proposed ATS-TFMWA and ATS-TFMWG opera‑
tors and also, we discussed their desirable properties.
↓ In Section 5.4, we developed a method to solve multi-criteria decision-
making problems and then gave an example.
↓ In Section 5.5, we submitted a comparison table including the results 
of some existing methods.
 In Section 5.6, we proposed the conclusion.

By considering the value of TFM-numbers, we can compare two TFM-
numbers T1 and T2 as follows:
If Val(T1) < Val(T2) then T1 <T2.
If Val(T1) > Val(T2) then T1 >T2.
If Val(T1) = Val(T2) then T1 =T2.

(0, 1), it is called Archimedean t-norm. If an Archimedean t-norm is strictly 
increasing in each variable for x, y ∈ (0, 1), it is called strict Archimedean 
t-norm. If a t-conorm function s(x, y) is continuous and s(x, x) > x for all 
x ∈ (0,1), it is called Archimedean t-conorm. If an Archimedean t-conorm 
is strictly increasing in each variable for x, y ∈ (0, 1), it is called strict 
Archimedean t-conorm.
In Ref. [50], a strict Archimedean t-norm can be rewritten by its additive 
generator h as
	
( , )
( ( )
( ))

=

s x y

and it can be applied to its dual t-conorm

It is clear that an additive generator of a continuous Archimedean t-norm is 
a strictly decreasing function g: [0,1] → [0,1] satisfying g(1) = 0.
If another specific form is given to the g, then some well-known t-conorms 
and t-norms can be taken as follows [36,49,51,52]:

5.3  TFM-AGGREGATION OPERATORS BASED ON 
ARCHIMEDEAN T-CONORM AND T-NORM
In this section, we developed some TFM-Aggregation operators based on 
Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm for aggregating the TFM-information. 
Some of it is quoted/adopted and/or inspired and/or generalized from Ref. 
[26,36,45–49,51,52].

In particular, if ρ = 1, then the operational laws in (9)–(12) 
are converted into the corresponding operational laws (1)–(4) in 
Definition 5.8; if ρ = 2, then the operational laws in (9)–(12) are 
converted into the operational laws in (5)–(8).

Proof Proof of the theorem can be easily done similar to the ATS-TFMWA 
operator. This is why no need to prove ATS-TFMWG operator here again.
If another specific forms given to the g, then following trapezoidal fuzzy 
aggregation operators can be taken as follows [38]:

5.4  AN APPROACH TO TFM-ATTRIBUTE 
DECISION-MAKING PROBLEMS
Suppose that we have a decision-making problem given in the TFM-
environment. Let A = {a1, a2, …, am} be set alternatives to and C = {c1, c2, 
…, cn} be set of criteria. To evaluate the suitability of the alternatives ai 
with regards to cj, information that the alternative ai satisfies the attribute cj 
needed to be provided. Then, the TFM-decision matrix R = (rij)mxn should 
be constructed. In order to find the ranking of the alternatives, the follow‑
ing algorithm is given as follows:

Algorithm
Step 1 Construct TFM decision matrix in which results of the evaluation 
of the expert considering the characteristic of the alternative ai with 
regards to cj based on Table 5.1 as follows:

Step 4 Calculate the values of Ri defined in Definition 5.11 and find the

(i = 1,2, …, m) the bigger the Ri, the better the alternative ai.
Example 5.1
In a business, the head manager wants to buy a work planning soft‑
ware to make his business more modernized. For this, the head man‑
ager considers several criteria (or attributes) such as
c1: financial profit
c2: installation cost
c3: technological contribution
c4: speed up matters
The set of criteria is C = (c1, c2, c3, c4). Their weight vector is w = (0.3, 
0.2, 0.4, 0.1)T. Five suppliers to be considered and their set is Y = (y1, 
y2, y3, y4, y5).
Step 1: We constructed the TFM-decision matrix B based on lin‑
guistic terms in Table 5.2 as;

In Table 5.4, we submitted a table to compare the introduced method with the 
existing methods, for example, TFM-weighted geometric operator proposed 
by Ulucay et al. [26], weighted dice vector similarity operator introduced by 
Sahin et al. [28], vector similarity operator submitted by Ulucay [30], dis‑
tance measure operator given by Deli and Keles [31], Bonferroni arithmetic 
mean operator on TFM-numbers, Bonferroni geometric mean operator on 
TFM-numbers, Geometric Heronian mean operator on TFM-numbers and 
Weighted Bonferroni harmonic mean operator on TFM-numbers proposed 
by Kesen [32]. The introduced aggregation method can be used to cope 
with the decision-making problems given with multi-criteria. If we review 
the comparison table, we can observe that the results are almost the same. 
Therefore, the submitted method is consistent with existing methods and 
can be used to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems.

134  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
5.6  CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we investigated multiple attribute group decision-making 
(MAGDM) problems in which the attribute values are given in the form of 
trapezoidal fuzzy information. Based on the notion of mean aggregations, 
a new type of mean aggregation operators called Archimedean norms 
operator for aggregating trapezoidal fuzzy information was introduced. 
Afterward, a solution algorithm was proposed to access a solution for 
multi-criteria decision-making problems. Finally, an illustrative example 
was given to verify the developed approach and to show its usefulness 
and efficiency. In the future, we plan to apply Archimedean norms to 
trapezoidal hesitant fuzzy numbers, triangular hesitant fuzzy numbers, 
trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy multi-numbers and neutrosophic fuzzy 
multi-numbers.

Recent trends  
and advancements in uncertain 
inventory management
Ankit Dubey and Ranjan Kumar
6.1  INTRODUCTION
Operational research (OR) is a scientific approach to problem-solving and 
decision-making that uses statistical analysis [1], mathematical modeling 
[2], and optimization techniques to help individuals and organizations 
make better decisions. It was developed during World War II [1939-1944] 
by Watt and Rowe [3] to manage scarce resources. Safitri et al. [4] proposed 
the dual simplex method to solve goal programming problems. Braglia et al. 
[5] introduced a stock diffusion theory for inventory control problems. 
Recently, Al‑Salih and Bohner [6] proposed the time scales approach for 
solving quadratic programming, which is an efficient and precise approach 
to this problem. OR has many other applications, but in this chapter, we are 
only discussing the inventory problem in the paragraph below.
Inventory models are an important application of OR techniques. An 
inventory model calculates the ideal inventory level for a business to 
meet consumer demand [7], inventory cost [8], and restocking time [9]. 
Additionally, we can also observe that the inventory control model has sev‑
eral applications, such as automotive [10], manufacturing [11], maintenance 
and repair [12], logistics and supply-chain [13], food and beverage [14], 
healthcare [15], aerospace and defense [16], construction [17], education 
[18], and so on. Table 6.1 provides a short overview of the different applica‑
tions of inventory control in various fields and highlights the main advan‑
tages and characteristics of each method.
Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1 can help readers better understand the con‑
cepts discussed in the chapter and visualize how inventory control works 
in practice.
After reviewing the introduction, it is evident that there are several 
gaps in the study of classical inventory problems. These gaps have moti‑
vated us to explore recent trends and advancements in uncertain inven‑
tory ­management systems. Our goal is to provide insights into evolutionary

methods commonly described by inventory theory and highlight key aspects 
of management, such as inventory and supply chain management with 
uncertain scenarios. By doing so, we aim to help researchers and students 
gain a thorough understanding of fuzzy inventory models (FIMs) through 
a single review chapter, which will aid in the discovery and encouragement 
of advancements in the fuzzy inventory management field.
To achieve this goal, our review article comprehensively surveys impor‑
tant aspects of FIM. We discuss the existence of inventory theory and its 
sub‑areas in real‑life problems and current challenges under uncertainty in 
inventory management.
In the subsequent sections of the chapter, we organize the flow as ­follows: 
Section 6.2 provides insight into the demerits of the classical inventory 
model. Sections 6.3 and 6.4 provide an overview of the FIM and the related 
research that has already been done, along with the latest extensions, 
respectively. We summarize the contribution made by various researchers 
on these models in a tabular form. Finally, in Section 6.5, we present a sum‑
mary of our conclusions regarding inventory management.

6.2  THE DISCUSSION OF CHALLENGES  
OF THE CLASSICAL INVENTORY MODEL
In this section, we will be discussing the limitations of the Challenges and 
classical inventory models.
Valliathal and Uthayakumar [22] investigated the effects of an economic 
order quantity (EOQ) model on non‑instantaneously deteriorating com‑
modities related to time‑dependent selling rates, partial backlogging, and 
price variations all taken into account. Research verifies the existence and 
uniqueness of the optimal solution and examines the solution’s sensitivity 
to different inputs. The managerial ramifications of these findings are sub‑
stantial. Stochastic demand patterns can be added in place of deterministic, 
using both quantity discounts and payment delays can be implemented. 
Variables including changing prices, backorders, and demand over time are

standard inclusions in classical inventory models. It has been noticed that 
uncertainty can have a major effect on these factors, rendering the classical 
inventory model useless for predicting the best possible outcomes.
Sicilia et al. [23] examined deterministic inventory systems for constantly 
degrading items. The research assumes demand swings and follows a power 
pattern, allowing and backlogging shortages. Inventory management considers 
holding, backlog, ordering, depreciation, and purchasing costs. The research 
recommends two choice variables to minimize inventory cycle cost. Sicilia 
et al. [23] explored price variations, partial backlogging, and time‑dependent 
selling rates, as considered by Valliathal and Uthayakumar [22]. Ordering, 
storage, backlog, degradation, and purchase costs were examined. Because 
the uncertainty affects these variables, the conventional inventory approach 
may not reliably anticipate optimal solutions.
The paper by Shaikh et al. [24] presents an inventory model that incorpo‑
rates price, stock dependence, fully backlogged shortage, and inflation. The 
model describes the demand function as dependent on both the price and the 
stock, with demand during shortage periods dependent solely on the price 
of the product. The product price is dependent on different markup rates. 
The model considers deterioration as a non‑instantaneous process that starts 
after the item stock in the retailer’s inventory has been held for some time. 
Shortages are allowed and fully backlogged. This results in a constrained 
optimization problem that was solved using Lingo 10 software. To demon‑
strate and validate the inventory model, the researchers used a numerical 
example with different markup rates. The results of a sensitivity analysis were 
analyzed to identify inventory parameters alteration. The parameters used 
by Shaikh et al. [24] differ from those used by Valliathal and Uthayakumar 
[22] and Sicilia et al. [23]. Considering additional parameters, such as price, 
stock dependence, fully backlogged shortage, and inflation, which were not 
previously considered by the aforementioned authors, this uniqueness sets 
this book apart from other research articles in the field. The variables used in 
classical inventory models include price, stock dependence, fully backlogged 
shortage, and inflation.
The proposed EOQ model by Khurana et al. [25] assumes that each item 
in an order is in excellent condition. However, production systems cannot 
always rely on this assumption because of things like process deteriora‑
tion. Taking into account the time‑dependent and linear nature of prod‑
uct demand, the link between the demand rate, production rate, and the 
time‑dependent degradation rate of products, Khurana et al. [25] provide 
an economic production quantity model for deteriorating items. The model 
accounts for partially delayed shortages and assumes an infinite supply of 
storage space for objects that have totally degraded before being thrown 
away. To mimic backordering and lost sales, backlogging is used only when 
it is profitable to do so. To minimize overall average cost and live up to 
market demands and expectations, the proposed inventory policy optimizes 
production run time, production amount, and shortage period. Production 

142  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
cycle time, production volume, and shortfall duration are typical inputs in 
classical inventory models. However, conventional inventory models fre‑
quently fail to reliably forecast optimal solutions because of the significant 
level of uncertainty related to each of these factors.
In conclusion, inventory models are a set of mathematical strategies used 
to optimize stock on hand, purchase orders, and reorder points to meet 
consumer demands at the lowest possible cost. In some cases, in a decision‑ 
making process where there are multiple factors to consider, some of which 
may be difficult to quantify, fuzzy logic can provide a more flexible and 
nuanced approach than an inventory model. That is why, fuzzy logic can 
be better than inventory models because it can take into account a wider 
range of factors and can incorporate subjective or qualitative information. 
Therefore, the fuzzy theory was first introduced by Lotfi A. Zadeh [26] in 
his 1965.
6.3  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 
FUZZY INVENTORY MODEL
Lately, Dubois and Parade [27] introduced the fuzzy inventory model. 
Fuzzy logic determines the ideal inventory levels that minimize inventory 
expenses and meet service standards. In economics [28], engineering [29], 
and management [30], the fuzzy inventory model has been improved to han‑
dle inventory management uncertainty and imprecision. Considering the 
common fuzzy inventory models such as Fuzzy Economic Order Quantity 
(FEOQ) [31], Fuzzy Just-In-Time (FJIT) [32], Fuzzy Production Inventory 
Model(FPIM) [33], Fuzzy Multi-Item Inventory Model(FMIIM) [34] and so 
on. These are examples of popular types of fuzzy stock inventories. Hence, 
fuzzy inventory models are used to handle the uncertainty and imprecision 
that exist in inventory management.
As we all know the FIM is a critical function for any business that deals 
with physical products. Recent trends and advancements in uncertain 
inventory management have focused on improving accuracy and ­efficiency 
in forecasting demand [35], managing inventory levels, and minimizing 
stockouts. Overall, these trends and advancements have greatly enhanced 
the ability of businesses to manage their inventory with greater accuracy 
and efficiency in the face of uncertainty. In below Table 6.2 and Picture 
6.2 provides a short overview of some of the major contributions to the 
FIM.
Figure 6.2, can help readers better understand the concepts discussed 
in the chapter and visualize how fuzzy inventory control operates in real-
world scenarios.

6.4  SOME MORE RECENT TRENDS AND 
ADVANCEMENTS IN UNCERTAIN 
INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
In this section, we will be discussing recent trends and advancements in 
inventory models. Additionally, we have considered uncertainty as a signifi‑
cant parameter and discussed its effects.
Indrajitsingha et  al. [41] examined FIM with fixed degrading items, 
stock‑dependent demand rate, and shortages under fully backlogged con‑
ditions. Assuming the number of conditions, including one inventory with 
no lead time, full backlog allowance, infinite replenishment rate, but finite 
size, stock‑dependent finite time horizon, demand rate, and no repair of 
deteriorated items. All inventory‑related parameters were assumed to be 
hexagonal fuzzy numbers during the development of the suggested model 
in the fuzzy setting. A numerical example shows that the Signed Distance 
Method reduces the fuzzy model optimal cost outcome, compared with 
the crisp.
Saranya and Varadarajan [42] introduce inventory models often face 
uncertainty, which can stem from vagueness in the underlying assumptions. 
For instance, Saranya and Varadarajan [42] assumed constant demand and 
time, while allowing for shortage costs and fuzziness in holding, ordering,

and backorder costs. To model this, they proposed an FIM that considers 
acceptable shortages that are fully backlogged. Specifically, they used tri‑
angular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to fuzzify the carrying, backorder, 
and ordering costs, resulting in a fuzzy total cost. Our research uses graded 
mean integration value to defuzzify the total profit function. Saranya and 
Varadarajan [42] and Rajput et al. [38] optimized FIM cost in scarcity using 
the signed distance approach.
Rajput et al.’s [38] study centers on preserving the quantity and quality 
of restocking orders under an inventory model with shortage. Since fuzzy 
modeling of inventories can yield more accurate results than crisp models, 
it is gaining in popularity to optimize the inventory model and enhance the 
precision of the results by employing fuzzy set theory. The overall cost of

both crisp and fuzzy models was analyzed and compared in Rajput et al.’s 
[38] study. The authors compared one‑parameter (deficiency) fuzzy models 
to two‑parameter (ample) crisp models. Some of the new parameters the 
authors have introduced to the crisp model are deterministic and probabi‑
listic forms of demand, variable lead time, inflation, partial backlogging, 
variable production rate, permissible delay, defective rate, remanufactur‑
ing time, varying costs, and shortage periods for retailers and suppliers. 
The model was subsequently subjected to fuzzy approaches, which led to 
improved results like minimum overall cost and maximum profit.
Nagamani and Balaji [43], in last, suggested inventory models often suf‑
fer from uncertainty due to their inherent fuzziness, and adopting a fuzzy 
approach can bring us closer to reality. In their recent paper, Nagamani 
and Balaji [43] proposed a hazy inventory system that can accommodate 
shortages, leading to a complete backlog. They used fuzzy triangular num‑
bers to estimate carrying costs, backorder costs, and inventory costs and 
made certain assumptions, such as the demand for the goods being con‑
stant, a consistent timetable, and allowing for cost‑cutting, while fuzzily 
accounting for the costs of holding, ordering, and shortfall. This study 
aims to clarify the genuine profit function using the Graded Maximum 
Integration Value Method. The authors use arithmetic to demonstrate 
crisp and fuzzy modeling.
The literature analysis on FIMs involving stock‑dependent demand rate 
and fixed degrading items with shortages under fully backlogged conditions 
addresses uncertainty and fuzziness provides realistic results than crisp 
models. The Signed Distance Method and Graded Mean Integration Value 
Method Fuzzification inventory rules to minimize overall cost or maximize 
profit. The cycle assumes constant demand and time, zero lead time, totally 
backlogged shortages, finite time horizon, infinite replenishment rate but 
with finite size, and no repair of deteriorating items. In the crisp model, 
they added inflation, demand kinds, partial backlogging, lead time, manu‑
facturing rate, and retailer and supplier costs. These authors’ FIMs may 
increase inventory control and management accuracy.
6.5  CONCLUSION
This chapter critically reviews and classifies the current approaches and 
methodologies developed by researchers and scientists for modeling and 
analyzing inventory management systems in diverse sectors, such as health‑
care, supply chain, and routing problems. Furthermore, recent trends and 
advancements in inventory management systems in uncertain environments 
are also discussed. Drawing upon the findings of the literature review, we 
propose an integrated research framework that is applicable to current and 

146  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
future research endeavors. In the near future, we plan to conduct a litera‑
ture review on fuzzy extension theories, such as Neutrosophic, Pythagorean, 
Intuitionistic, and others. Our rationale for this is that we believe fuzzy the‑
ory alone is insufficient for effectively handling uncertainty. Keeping this in 
mind, we intend to undertake a comprehensive literature review on fuzzy 
extension theory.

technique in construction 
under uncertain environment

7.1  INTRODUCTION
Operations research is a multidisciplinary field that leverages expertise 
from applied mathematics, computer science, and systems engineering [1]. 
Zachariah et al. [2] have noted that it encloses a wide range of techniques for 
improving decision‑making in real‑world problems [3]. Initially, the opera‑
tions research field was developed to improve military equipment during 
World War II, but since then, it has evolved and now applies to advanced 
analytical models to tackle logistical challenges in various industries. In 
operations research, decision‑making involves identifying the problem, and 
determining relevant decision criteria and constraints, by analyzing pos‑
sible outcomes using mathematical models and analytical techniques [4]. It 
describes the discipline as encompassing a broad spectrum of methods used 
to find the optimal values of decision variables subject to constraints, such 
as minimizing costs or maximizing profits [5].
The field of operations research offers a range of techniques that can be 
applied to decision‑making environments characterized by varying degrees 
of certainty, uncertainty, and risk in real‑life problems [6]. Knowledge of 
these environments enables the selection of a quantitative approach for 
decision‑making that can be utilized across multiple domains, including 
healthcare, finance, transportation, energy, and logistics. Optimization 
techniques, such as the simplex method [7], theory of games [8], assignment 
problem [9], the dual revised simplex method [10], integer linear program‑
ming [11], inventory [12], project evaluation and review technique/critical 
path method (PERT/CPM) [13], and many more, can aid in solving complex 
problems and make better decisions. Despite the benefits of optimization 
techniques, identifying some barriers exists within its sub‑areas as Azlan 
et  al. [14] examine techniques and approaches to enhance the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the simplex method. However, for large‑scale prob‑
lems, the simplex method may not be efficient. In their works, Kapliński 
and Tamošaitiene [15] and Faudzi et  al. [16] explored the use of game

theory in construction engineering, as well as in optimizing student–teacher 
­matching and course scheduling in education through assignment prob‑
lems. However, they also highlighted the limitations of game theory and 
assignment problems, which often rely on certain assumptions that may not 
accurately reflect real‑world situations. Further, Salookolaei and Nasseri 
[17] faced computational complexity in large datasets, as it requires more 
computational resources and time compared with other methods, especially 
for problems with numerous constraints and variables on working with a 
dual simplex method that uses duality results to solve grey linear program‑
ming problems with greater efficiency and accuracy.
Accordingly, Rieck et  al. [18] and Bruccoleri et  al. [19] employed the 
techniques of mixed integer programming and inventory problem, respec‑
tively. However, the accuracy and completeness of the input data used in 
both techniques can impact the reliability of the results obtained. The reli‑
ability of the outcomes in mixed‑integer linear programming relies heavily 
on the precision and completeness of the input data. Similarly, for inventory 
problems, incomplete data can lead to inaccurate inventory records and 
negatively impact the performance of the supply chain. Hence, ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the input data is crucial for obtaining reliable 
results in both techniques.
By observing the above limitations in the sub‑areas of operations research 
working under numerous real‑life problems, complex projects typically 
require a specific sequence of tasks and activities having interdependency 
between them. Complex projects require rigorous project planning and 
scheduling to manage all activities and resources. To resolve such cases, 
network analysis techniques like the CPM and PERT have proven to be 
useful in real‑life problems as they can effectively manage and control the 
complexity of large‑scale projects [20]. These techniques can help to iden‑
tify critical paths, optimize resource allocation, and provide a framework 
for effective project management. Therefore, CPM/PERT remains a valu‑
able tool in the arsenal of techniques used in operational research to tackle 
complex problems in various fields, including construction, engineering, 
and management [21]. Our primary objective is to review the application 
of CPM/PERT in the construction field under conditions of both certainty 
and uncertainty. CPM/PERT are scheduling methods that were originally 
designed to plan and analyze construction projects by coordinating cost 
and time criteria through a network of related activities [22]. According 
to Kelley et al. [23], CPM/PERT are beneficial tools for managing vari‑
ous types of projects, not only limited to construction, engineering, facility 
maintenance, research, and development.
In the next sections, this chapter reviews some state‑of‑art related to the 
construction field by observing various parameters under certainty and 
uncertainty using CPM/PERT techniques. This review aims to show dif‑
ferent developments in using CPM/PERT techniques to optimize better 
solutions in a certain environment of the construction field as observed

in Section 7.2. Further, Section 7.3 identifies the observation using CPM/
PERT technique in the construction field under an uncertain environment 
followed by a conclusion and references.
7.2  LITERATURE SURVEY
This section is divided into two subsections, Section 7.2.1 discuss the back‑
ground study on classical CPM/PERT Section 7.2.2 discusses the identified 
challenges under CPM/PERT techniques in the construction field and the 
limitations while working in a certain environment, and Section 7.2.3 dis‑
cusses the working fuzzy CPM/PERT that is represented in Figure 7.1 and 
further Section 7.3 reviews the advancements and developments in con‑
struction field followed by observation and conclusion.
7.2.1  CPM/PERT: a background
CPM is considered a convenient tool that provides schedules for monitoring 
the development of project activities [23]. According to Snyder [24], CPM, 
also known as critical path analysis, was created in the 1950s by DuPont 
Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation to provide an accurate esti‑
mation of project cost and time. The Polaris project, initiated by the U.S. 
Navy in 1958 [25], led to the development of the PERT, which is one of 
the most widely used techniques for visualizing various project scheduling 
scenarios because of its great complexity and ambiguity. PERT concepts 
served as the foundation for CPM, and both approaches have developed 
concurrently adhering to the same planning paradigm [26]. The primary 
distinction between the two techniques makes use of a probabilistic distri‑
bution to distinguish between single‑time estimates and three‑time estima‑
tions [27]. The optimal statistical computation for project completion time 
might be obtained by combining CPM and PERT [28], which would enable 
the focus on critical activities and would allow non‑critical activities to 
become critical [29].
CPM/PERT techniques were developed for basic managerial functions 
of planning, scheduling, and controlling [22]. CPM/PERT was originally

intended for construction project planning, to employ network‑related 
activities and analyze the representation of tasks that need to be completed 
in the given project, by coordinating optimal cost and time criteria [30]. 
The following subsections will discuss the application of CPM/PERT tech‑
niques in the construction industry.
7.2.2  Classical CPM/PERT under construction
For the literature review, several researchers’ works were examined to 
understand the workflow for the model development. Owing to an increas‑
ingly competitive environment, construction projects have become increas‑
ingly complex and dynamic due to the evolving requirements of technology 
and financial structures. In the past, traditional tools such as CPM/PERT 
were commonly used to manage construction projects, which followed a 
structured process. The underlying concept of minimizing total project 
duration was the basis for the development of CPM/PERT scheduling tech‑
niques, but now, due to the emergence of new technologies, construction 
projects demand a more flexible and adaptable approach to meet the chang‑
ing demands of the industry. According to Zhou et al. [31], project sched‑
uling entails several crucial challenges, including resource allocation, risk 
analysis, and scheduling fast track, as depicted in Figure 7.2. Table 7.1 sum‑
marizes the studies in the literature for a better understanding.
Based on the challenges, Joshi and Patil [32] found that analyzing the 
resource leveling in a construction project using CPM increased project 
length simultaneously increasing the project duration. CPM helps to plan, 
schedule, and manage construction projects by creating logical linkages 
between project activities. It is deterministic and ignores project activity 
uncertainty. Thus, probabilistic estimates are laborious as Liu [33] exam‑
ines the uses of PERT in construction risk analysis for risk management 
and performance improvement. In the study, it was discovered that PERT 
is a comprehensive framework for controlling, project planning, monitor‑
ing, and construction risk assessments. Additionally, Zareei [34] proposed 
a project scheduling model using CPM for the construction of a biogas

plant to demonstrate the CPM approach application in project scheduling 
for the renewable energy sector. The findings showed without any delays, 
by obtaining the minimum completion time.
As an alternative, heuristic methods of resolving the resource allocation 
problem have been suggested based on the resources, scheduling, and envi‑
ronments. As project resource‑scheduling issues have come to the fore, even 
though CPM/PERT exists, in such cases, artificial intelligence approaches, 
such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), have been used to implement CPM and 
PERT processes because of the complexity and difficulty. Using dynamic 
CPM and PERT networks, Calp and Akcayol [35] proposed a novel method 
for optimizing project scheduling tasks. The use of GAs illustrates the value 
of their suggested approach through a case study and contrasts the out‑
comes with those attained using alternative optimization techniques.
The lack of specificity in a situation with numerous possible outcomes 
due to insufficient information about the event’s result is referred to as 
uncertainty [36]. These uncertain situations, commonly known as risk 
analysis can be handled by the simulation technique. By integrating the 
probable value of each activity as a crucial value, according to Barraza [37] 
evaluation Monte Carlo Simulation has the advantage of producing realistic 
estimation results. Liu and Li [38] developed a risk management strategy

that is connected to project activities that have an impact on the entire proj‑
ect schedule in construction utilizing PERT and Monte Carlo simulation. 
Further, Wali and Othman [39] proposed a risk management approach for 
residential project scheduling using Monte Carlo simulation to develop a 
framework for assessing the risks associated with project activities and 
their impact on the overall project schedule. Later, Hendradewa [40] aims 
to utilize a combination of the CPM and PERT & Monte Carlo simula‑
tion to assess the risks associated with different phases of the construction 
project and their impact on the overall project schedule. The paper aims 
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a case 
study and to compare its results with those obtained from traditional sched‑
ule analysis.
During the past decade, the fast‑tracking delivery method has become 
a popular alternative to the traditional sequential method due to its time‑­
saving feature. Fast‑tracking can affect the development process conven‑
tionally, despite its advantages. Barwa [41] compared the CPM/PERT in 
project planning, to identify which method is more suitable for fast‑tracking 
project delivery and Ba’Its et al. [42] proposed a combination of PERT and 
CPM for project schedule development, to enhance the accuracy of project 
scheduling and facilitate fast‑tracking project delivery. Recently, Ramdani 
et  al. [43] conducted a meta‑analysis study to evaluate the performance 
of three project management methods  –  CPM, PERT, and earned value 
analysis (EVA) – in controlling time and cost in fast‑tracked construction 
projects to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method, as well as 
to provide insights into the best practices for project managers to effectively 
control time and cost in fast‑tracked construction projects.
Based on the literature survey, the problems identified under classical 
CPM/PERT are depicted in Figure 7.3.
In real‑world scenarios, upon reviewing the literature, uncertainty plays 
a critical factor in construction projects. However, estimating project dura‑
tion becomes challenging due to incurring risk events and associated con‑
sequences uncertainty. In today’s competitive world, completing projects 
on time without delays, addresses the problems of vagueness in real‑world 
decision‑making environments, Zadeh [44] proposed fuzzy set theory, 
Figure 7.3  Classical CPM/PERT problems.

which plays a significant role in various fields of science and technology, 
expanding the domain of decision‑making in industrial systems [45]. Fuzzy 
set theory is extensively used in linear programming, game theory, goal 
programming, dynamic programming, transportation models, and nonlin‑
ear programming [46].
7.2.3  FUZZY CPM/PERT: a background study
Chanas and Radosinski [47] and Prade [48] established the fuzzy network 
planning problem with the central idea, as the representation of non‑­
deterministic durations of operations using fuzzy numbers. The development 
of the fuzzy approach in network project analysis, with methods like the 
fuzzy CPM and fuzzy PERT proposes the use of fuzzy number sets to model 
the activity times. Several researchers, such as Chanas and Kamburowski 
[49], Dubois and Prade [50], Buckley [51], Chanas [52], Gazdik [53], Mares 
[54], Tsujimura et al. [55], McCahon and Lee [56], Han et al. [57], Chanas 
and Zielinski [58], Nasution [59,60], Slyeptsov and Tyshchuk [61], and Liang 
and Han [62] presented the utilization of fuzzy method in network analysis.
The incorporation of fuzzy logic in fuzzy CPM and fuzzy PERT is used 
to handle uncertainty and imprecision in project management. Fuzzy logic 
is a mathematical framework that can handle uncertainty and imprecision 
by assigning degrees of membership to different values. In traditional CPM 
and PERT methods, project activities are assumed to have ­deterministic 
durations and are represented as single‑point estimates. However, in real‑­
world projects, fuzzy CPM and fuzzy PERT can also provide more reliable 
estimates of project duration and help to make better project decisions. The 
proposed literature was used to identify and determine the implementation 
considering the effect of vagueness in the completion of individual con‑
struction works.
7.3  TRENDS IN CONSTRUCTION MODEL BY USING 
CPM/PERT UNDER UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT
The fuzzy set theory plays an important part in the construction industry; 
it has been studied over the last 50 years. The various literature is studied 
to get an overview of the factors responsible for the construction industry 
using the fuzzy logic set theory. Table 7.2 summarizes the studies in the 
literature for better understanding.
One of the earliest attempts to solve the resource leveling problem was 
made by Crandall [63], who defined the core idea of resource leveling as a 
process that allows available resources to activities that satisfy a collection 
of project and time‑related criteria. Further many studies, such as Chang 
and Ibbs [64] developed a fuzzy expert system that incorporates multiple 
parameters to make informed decisions in resource scheduling. This system 

Comparative study on critical path method and project evaluation  157
offers a flexible and accurate approach, which can improve project out‑
comes and increase efficiency in the construction industry. As an extension 
to the work, Chang and Crandall [65] proposed an expected possibility 
algorithm based on fuzzy set theory that handles uncertain and imprecise 
information in construction resource allocation. The algorithm considers 
inherent uncertainties providing a more realistic and accurate approach to 
construction resource allocation. The algorithm also helps decision‑makers 
assess the risks associated with resource allocation decisions and identify 
areas for improvement.

Further, risk management is a crucial aspect of project management, 
and every project is subject to various types of risk. However, Mazlum and 
Güneri [66] proposed a fuzzy logic‑based approach using fuzzy CPM and 
fuzzy PERT to estimate expected time, variance, and project activity comple‑
tion, along with a risk assessment model to analyze potential project risks. 
Similarly, Soni et al. [67] also involved a fuzzy logic‑based approach that 
integrated CPM and PERT techniques to evaluate and assess the risks associ‑
ated with various activities in a construction project. The proposed approach 
provided a more comprehensive and accurate risk assessment than tradi‑
tional methods and generated results that can be utilized to develop effective 
risk management strategies. According to earlier research, as summarized 
by Lootsma and Lootsma (1997) [68], fuzzy logic is used to enhance tra‑
ditional CPM/PERT planning by considering fuzzy activity durations and 
resources with a variety of heuristic and meta‑heuristic methods. To analyze 
crucial activity in CPM/PERT networks, Yakhchali [69] path presented a 
path‑sorting technique using fuzzy activity time values. The research sets out 
to identify the most optimal critical activities and pathways and calculates 
the probability criticality degree of activities using an efficient method based 
on a path enumeration technique by obtaining real‑world project networks.
Late completion of a project can have detrimental effects on a company, 
including penalties and customer dissatisfaction. In such situations, project 
managers can use additional resources to bring the project back on track, 
called as crashing in project management. However, since crashing a proj‑
ect involves additional costs, the decision to crash needs to be made cost‑­
effectively. To choose the best course of action, the trade‑off between the 
penalty cost and the crashing cost must be considered. To address this chal‑
lenge, Rahman et al. [70] proposed a fuzzy crashing algorithm that incorpo‑
rates fuzzy logic into the CPM/PERT networks to improve the accuracy and 
reliability of crashing analysis. This approach allows more realistic and flexible 
project planning and decision‑making in uncertain environments, particularly 
in large‑scale construction projects. The paper presents numerical examples 
and comparative analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages 
of the proposed fuzzy CPM/PERT approach. Similarly, Galagali [71] investi‑
gated the critical issue faced by project managers in delivering projects within 
the shortest possible time, while maintaining maximum quality and minimiz‑
ing cost. The study implies that project crashing may impact quality, and an 
actual construction project was investigated to determine time, cost, and qual‑
ity trade‑off and highlights managerial insights and major issues.
In further problems, time‑cost trade‑off (TCTO) analysis attempts to 
shorten the project duration, effectively and efficiently. By identifying the 
ideal combination of activities and building techniques, TCTO analysis aims 
to reduce the overall project cost without lengthening the project’s comple‑
tion time. Leu et  al. [72] suggested a flexible strategy that blends using 
GA fuzzy set theory to resolve the uncertainties related to activity duration 
and expenses. They looked at how unpredictable activity durations affected 

Comparative study on critical path method and project evaluation  159
project direct costs were represented by fuzzy numbers. Like this, Abbasnia 
et al. [73] solution for resolving the TCTO using fuzzy logic theory by con‑
sidering uncertainties that impact the direct and indirect cost of a construc‑
tion project. To give a trade‑off between time and overall cost they used a 
non‑dominated sorting genetic technique.
Recently, Likewise, Habibi [74] survey estimated the time and cost of proj‑
ect activities using a fuzzy‑based methodology. The proposed method was 
used to estimate the implementation cost of a five‑story building construc‑
tion project in Tehran, Iran. The study shows that the proposed fuzzy‑based 
methodology reduces the impact of uncertainties on results and improves 
the accuracy of project cost estimation. Therefore, the approach holds on 
providing more accurate and realistic project cost estimation results.
Based on the literature survey, the problems identified under fuzzy CPM/
PERT are depicted in Figure 7.4.
As per the literature mentioned above, fuzzy CPM/PERT was developed 
to address some of the limitations in construction, compared with clas‑
sical CPM/PERT, particularly due to its inability to handle uncertainty 
and  imprecision in activity duration estimates. The primary motivation 
behind the development of Fuzzy CPM/PERT was to provide a more flex‑
ible and robust framework that could accommodate imprecise data and 
reflect the inherent uncertainty in project planning and scheduling, i.e., 
real‑world complexity, flexibility, improved accuracy, decision‑making, etc.
7.4  CONCLUSION
Classical CPM/PERT are planning and scheduling techniques that are 
widely used in construction, which solve many problems for better solu‑
tions in large‑scale projects. Due to their inefficiency in dealing with 
Figure 7.4  Fuzzy CPM/PERT problems.

160  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
impression or ambiguity in project time estimates, classical CPM and PERT 
have ­limited success in the ongoing environment of the construction phase. 
In such cases, the aim is to perform a thorough review of the literature on 
fuzzy extension theories. Our motivation for this review stems from our 
belief that fuzzy theory, on its own, does not adequately address the chal‑
lenges of managing uncertainty. Thus, we plan to conduct a comprehensive 
analysis of fuzzy extension theories, keeping this perspective in mind. The 
results of the study observations have demonstrated that fuzzy CPM and 
fuzzy PERT are widely employed in many projects‑related challenges, not 
only involving construction but immensely used in many applications. The 
study concluded that CPM and PERT approaches combined with fuzzy sets 
offer a fertile foundation for future researchers in the construction field.

8.1  INTRODUCTION
Operations research (OR) is a field of advanced applied mathematics that 
was developed during World War II (1939-1944) by Watt and Rowe [1]. 
It plays an important role in decision-making and problem-solving across 
many sectors and industries. According to Hillier and Lieberman [2], 
“Operations research is a scientific approach to solving decision problems, 
which involves the application of mathematical methods and models, and 
the use of computers to aid in decision‑making.” Some researchers [2], [3] 
have proposed various methods to solve linear programming problems 
(LPP). Powell [4] introduces a stochastic approach to solve the dynamic 
assignment problem for truckload motor carriers. Williams and Haley [5] 
suggest using transportation to solve the problem, which involves trans‑
forming the LPP into a transportation problem. Ehrgott et.al [6] offer a 
simplex primal-dual algorithm for multicriteria LPP to obtain the optimal 
solution. Cachon and Netessine [2] propose game theory as a useful tool 
for analyzing supply chain problems lastly, Abdullah and Abidin [3] recom‑
mend using linear programming (LP) with a single objective function to 
maximize profits for the red meat production problem. Hence, operations 
research is a field that deals with solving complex problems. Within the 
OR, there are various branches, and LP is one of the most important ones. 
If you want to explore linear programming further, please read the below 
paragraph.
LP is a mathematical modeling method normally used in OR to solve 
optimization problems. In 1947, G. Dantzig [1] introduced the LP model 
to solve the optimization problem. It involves optimizing a linear objective 
function while the constraints are also linear. OR uses LP to discourse a vari‑
ety of issues in different sectors, including transportation [8], logistics [9], 
and resource allocation [10]. Currently, LP is a popular technique utilized 
in numerous fields, such as economics [11], management [12], and so on.

the field of LP.
Furthermore, the chapter includes Figure 8.1. which serves as a graphical 
representation explaining the different methods and concepts associated 
with the LPP. 
Based on the aforementioned introduction, it becomes evident that there 
are several gaps in the study LP problem. This motivates us to show the latest 
changes and improvements in FLP. This chapter helps authors to learn both 
classical and FLP models through a single review chapter. Additionally, it 
focuses on basic parts of classical and FLP models, such as the sequencing 
problem [18], queueing theory [19], and Integer programming [20], and so 
on.
The main points covered in this review article are as follows: a concise sur‑
vey of significant aspects of the LP model. Discussion on the identification of 
LPPs and their sub‑areas in real‑life scenarios is characterized by uncertainty. 
Review of existing methodologies for solving LPP, including the graphical 
method [21], revised simplex [22], dual simplex [22], simplex method [1], and 
among others.

A short literature on linear programming problem  167
In this chapter, the subsequent sections are organized as follows. Section 8.2 
presents a discussion of the different types of classical LP ­models. Section 
8.3 explores some more recent trends and advancements in uncertain vari‑
ables. Section 8.4 introduces the concept of the fuzzy LPP. Finally, Section 
8.5 ­concludes the chapter.
8.2  DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFERENT  
TYPES OF CLASSICAL LPP MODELS
LP is a type of mathematical modeling technique that optimizes the linear 
objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. Several types of lin‑
ear programming models are commonly used, such as the graphical method 
[21] in LPP, the simplex method [7], dual simplex [22], revised simplex [7], 
and so on.
The Graphical method [21] is a useful tool for solving LPPs graphically, 
especially when they have two variables. LV Kantorovich introduced this 
method in 1939 [21]. However, the graphical method cannot solve prob‑
lems with multiple variables and constraints. To address this issue, George 
Dantzig [1] introduced the simplex method in 1947. In, 1954, C.E. Lemke 
Figure 8.1  Pictorial representation of Table 8.1.

168  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
[22] proposed another approach, the dual simplex method. However, none 
of these methods can handle the degeneracy and infeasibility in some cases. 
Therefore, an improved alternative, the revised simplex method, was devel‑
oped. The revised simplex method is a powerful and widely used algo‑
rithm for solving LPPs, and it remains an important tool in the field of 
optimization. Although many researchers have various methods, we can’t 
discuss them all in this manuscript. Hence, we will focus only on the sim‑
plex method. We will discuss the simplex method in detail in the following 
section of this chapter. Moreover, we will review of other authors and high‑
light the advantages and disadvantages of their approaches. For example, 
we will provide a detailed discussion on the use of a bi-objective optimiza‑
tion algorithm by Moradi et al. [23].
Moradi et al. [23] propose a column generation approach for resolving 
the bi‑objective multi‑commodity minimum cost flow problem (MOMCFP) 
that builds upon the bi‑objective simplex method and Dantzig–Wolfe 
decomposition. The technique starts by optimizing the problem regarding 
the first objective, which is a single‑objective multi‑commodity flow prob‑
lem, and utilizing Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. Subsequently, it itera‑
tively advances from one non‑dominated extreme point to the next, finding 
the entering variables with the maximum ratio of improvement in the sec‑
ond objective to the first objective’s deterioration, similar to the bi‑objective 
simplex method. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on various 
directed bi‑objective network instances with varying characteristics and 
numbers of commodities. Moradi et al. [23] attempted to address network 
problems in their article, recognizing that networks are highly impacted by 
uncertainty. It is well‑known that current LP approaches struggle to handle 
uncertain or imprecise information and cannot provide sufficiently robust 
solutions. Consequently, the existing LP models fail to offer optimal solu‑
tions due to the significant level of uncertainty present in network models. 
In line with this, Moradi et al. [23] focused on the bi‑objective problem. 
Similarly, Bonkoungou et al. [24] also worked on bi‑objective LPP. We have 
endeavored to present their contributions in the following paragraph for 
your reference.
Bonkoungou et al. [24] introduced a novel method for solving bi‑­objective 
LPP using the simplex method. The paper provides an overview of the fun‑
damental concepts of multi‑objective optimization and network flows, along 
with a concise literature review of existing work on MOMCFP. The algo‑
rithm’s key feature lies in its ability to discover the optimal solution without 
disrupting the network structure of the problems at hand. Network flow 
problems, particularly minimum cost network flow problems, are versatile 
optimization problems capable of modeling various real‑world scenarios. 
Computational results indicate that as the number of arcs in a fixed number 
of nodes increases, the average CPU time exhibits a significant rise. Hence, 
the CPU time primarily depends on the number of arcs in the network being

optimized. Notably, the algorithm is limited to linear objective functions 
with several variables subject to a set of linear equality or inequality con‑
straints. Future developments should explore addressing nonlinear objec‑
tive functions and constraints. Additionally, the practical application of the 
algorithm to real‑time decision problems remains a challenging endeavor 
that requires further exploration. Bonkoungou et  al. [24] investigated in 
their article to address the problem of telecommunication networks. It is 
well‑known that telecommunication networks are highly susceptible to 
the impact of uncertainty. Consequently, existing linear LP approaches are 
incapable of effectively handling uncertain or imprecise information, and 
they also fail to provide robust solutions. As a result, the current models are 
unable to yield optimal solutions due to the substantial level of uncertainty 
inherent in telecommunication network models.
In conclusion, Moradi et al. [23] proposed a column generation approach, 
building upon the bi‑objective simplex method and Dantzig–Wolfe decom‑
position, to solve the bi‑objective MCMCFP. Similarly, Bonkoungou et al. 
[24] introduced a simplex method‑based approach to solve bi‑objective LPP, 
focusing on the challenges posed by telecommunication networks. When 
faced with decision‑making processes involving multiple factors, some of 
which may be challenging to quantify, fuzzy logic offers a more adaptable 
and nuanced alternative to LP models. This is because fuzzy logic can cover 
a broader range of considerations and contribute to qualitative or subjective 
data. As a result, fuzzy logic surpasses LP models by taking into account 
a wider array of factors. The concept of fuzzy theory was originally intro‑
duced by Lotfi A. Zadeh [25] in 1965.

8.3.2  Introduction of FLP problems
The FLP model, initially presented by Zimmermann [28]. According to 
Dubois and Prade (2008) [29], “Fuzzy linear programming is a mathemati‑
cal programming methodology that allows for uncertain or imprecise data 
to be represented as fuzzy sets, and for the optimization of a fuzzy objective 
function subject to fuzzy constraints.” FLPP allows for the modeling and 
analysis of complex systems that involve uncertain or imprecise parameters, 
to handle the real-world problems. It helps us find better and more adapt‑
able ways to solve problems in the real world. In below table 8.2 and Figure 
8.2 we have discussed significance of FLP.
Incorporated within the chapter is Figure 8.2, which presents a graphical 
depiction of the components and processes involved in FLP. 
In the below section, we provide a short summary of the fuzzy simplex 
method (FSM). By understanding the basic concepts of the FSM, authors 
can appreciate its possible applications and benefits.
8.4  SOME MORE RECENT TRENDS AND 
ADVANCEMENTS IN UNCERTAIN
This section focuses on exploring the latest trends and advancements in 
FLP with a particular emphasis on the utilization of the Simplex method. 
Furthermore, the consideration of uncertainty as a crucial parameter is 
addressed, and the effects of uncertainty are thoroughly discussed.
Mansur Hassan [35]: LP is a widely used tool in operations research, 
­offering efficiency and simplicity in solving real‑life problems. However, 
in many cases, managers and decision‑makers lack precise information 
for the parameters used in optimization models. To address this issue, 
FLP provides a flexible approach that can effectively handle such situ‑
ations. This paper introduces a proposed simplex method for solving 
parametrized LP with imprecise resources. The main objective of this 
paper is to present a more comprehensive simplex method for solving 
FLP problems with fuzziness at the right‑hand side (RHS).
Liu and Shi [36]: Introduced a fuzzy stratified simplex method to 
solve complete stratified fuzzy multi-objective linear programming 
(FMOLP). The authors demonstrate that the obtained optimal solu‑
tion is also the fuzzy efficient solution of the FMOLP problems. 
The proposed method offers the advantage of directly obtaining the 
fuzzy optimal solution using  the extended primal simplex method. 
Furthermore, the authors prove that this fuzzy optimal solution is also 
the fuzzy efficient solution of the original FMOLP problem.
Tuffaha and Alrefaei [37]: This paper introduces a fully FLP problem 
with piecewise linear fuzzy numbers (PLFN‑n) and proposes a solution

method based on extending the simplex method. Tuffaha and Alrefaei 
[37] proposed a method that generalizes the conventional simplex 
algorithm and yields identical results when applied to crisp LPP. The 
use of PLFN‑n expands the range of problems solvable by this method, 
including transportation or supply chain problems with fuzzy data. 
Applying the method to an FFLP problem with PLFN‑n preserves 
ranking values throughout the solution, making it more realistic com‑
pared to other methods in the literature. 
Behera et al. [38]: In this research paper, Behera et al. [38] propose a 
methodology to solve FTP using linear fractional fuzzy numbers. 
The objective functions are represented by triangular fuzzy numbers 
(TFN). The main objective of this paper is to find optimal solutions to 
FTP using the simplex method, with TFN used to represent the costs 
of the objective function.

Overall, this chapter contribute to the field of operations research by pro‑
viding methods and techniques for solving FLP problems with various types 
of fuzziness.
8.5  CONCLUSION
This chapter has provided a detailed analysis and discussion of the fuzzy 
simplex method. The aim of this manuscript to analyze the challenges of 
the classical model. By focusing on the simplex method and drawing upon 
a comprehensive literature review, we have provided valuable visions into its 
theoretical fundamentals, algorithmic implementation, and advancements. 
The FSM presents opportunities for further research and development 
in area of LPP. This chapter serves as a valuable resource for researchers 
and practitioners seeking to optimize LPPs. Near future, our objective is 
to conduct an extensive analysis of the literature on fuzzy extension theo‑
ries, which involves Neutrosophic, Pythagorean, and Intuitionistic theories, 
among others. Our primary motivation for this review is rooted in our 
conviction that fuzzy theory alone is insufficient for effectively managing 
uncertainty. With this viewpoint in mind, we intend to undertake a thor‑
ough evaluation of fuzzy extension theories.

A note on translation of 
bipolar-valued fuzzy sets in 
Sheffer stroke MTL-algebras
T. Oner, I. Senturk, and A. Rezaei
9.1  INTRODUCTION
When constructing a mathematical model, it is crucial to simplify the expres‑
sion as much as possible by using the least number of axioms or operations. 
Tarski tackled this issue in his study of Abelian groups, where he found that 
a single axiom characterizes them based on the divisor operator [1].
Following Tarski’s approach, Oner and Senturk introduced the Sheffer 
stroke operation to reduce basic algebras to Sheffer stroke basic alge‑
bras, which play a critical role in numerous logics such as many-valued 
Łukasiewicz logics, non-classical logics, and fuzzy logics [2].
More recently, Esteva and Godo introduced MTL-algebras in [3], which 
have been the subject of many theorems aimed at strengthening their theo‑
retical framework [4,5]. For instance, Vetterlein demonstrated that most 
MTL-algebras can be embedded in the positive cone of a partially ordered 
group [4], and he also established that MTL-algebras are integral, commu‑
tative, bounded, and prelinear residuated lattices [5].
MTL-algebras have emerged as the most basic residuated structures that 
can induce all algebras from their residua and continuous t-norms, making 
them crucial in working with fuzzy logics and related structures [6].
In addition to their logical efforts, Senturk proposed a reduction for 
MTL-algebras solely based on the Sheffer stroke operation, which he called 
Sheffer stroke MTL-algebras [7]. Later, Senturk and Oner introduced the 
“very true” operator on Sheffer stroke MTL-algebras [8].
The concept of fuzzy sets was first introduced by Zadeh in 1965 [9]. 
Since then, fuzzy set theory has been widely applied in mathematics and 
other fields. There are various extensions of fuzzy sets, including intuition‑
istic fuzzy sets, interval-valued fuzzy sets, vague sets, and bipolar-valued 
fuzzy sets.
The notion of bipolar-valued fuzzy sets was introduced by Lee in 2000 
[10], as an extension of fuzzy sets with membership degree range [−1, 0]. 
Since then, several generalizations of bipolar-valued fuzzy sets have been 
proposed, and their applications to logical algebras have been studied 
extensively. For instance, Jun and Song [11] introduced bipolar fuzzy 

178  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
subalgebras and bipolar fuzzy closed ideals in BCH-algebras in 2008, while 
Jun and Park [12] introduced bipolar fuzzy regularities, bipolar fuzzy regu‑
lar subalgebras, bipolar fuzzy filters, and bipolar fuzzy closed quasi-filters 
in BCH-algebras in 2009. Lee and Jun [13] introduced the notion of bipo‑
lar fuzzy a-ideals of BCI-algebras in 2011, and Jun et al. [14] introduced 
bipolar fuzzy CI-subalgebras, bipolar fuzzy ideals, and (closed) bipolar 
fuzzy filters in CI-algebras in 2012. In 2014, Muhiuddin [15] introduced 
bipolar fuzzy KU-subalgebras and bipolar fuzzy KU-ideals in KU-algebras, 
while Senapati [16] introduced the notion of bipolar fuzzy BG-subalgebras 
in BG-algebras in 2015. Recently, Sabarinathan et al. [17] introduced the 
notion of bipolar-valued fuzzy ideals and bipolar-valued fuzzy H-ideals of 
BF-algebras in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Bipolar-valued fuzzy sets have found applications beyond logical algebras 
and have been extended to bipolar fuzzy translations in various algebraic 
structures. In 2009, Jun et al. [18] introduced the notions of bipolar fuzzy 
translations and bipolar fuzzy S-extensions of a bipolar fuzzy subalgebra 
in BCK/BCI-algebras. In 2012, Sardar et al. [19] extended the concept to 
bipolar-valued fuzzy translations and bipolar-valued fuzzy S-extensions of 
a bipolar-valued fuzzy sub-semigroup (bi-ideal) in semigroups.
These studies demonstrate the importance of bipolar-valued fuzzy sets 
and their applications to various algebraic structures, which can help to 
develop more effective algorithms for solving complex problems in various 
fields.
In this study, we put forward the concept of bipolar fuzzy translation 
and bipolar fuzzy S-extension of a bipolar fuzzy subalgebra in a BCK/BCI-
algebra, along with an investigation of their properties.

Application of the greedy 
Dhouib‑matrix‑TP1 method to 
optimize the transportation 
problem under triangular 
fuzzy domain
Souhail Dhouib, Saima Dhouib, and Aida Kharat
10.1  INTRODUCTION
The transportation problem (TP) is one of the famous problems in combi‑
natorial optimization. It deals with shipping products from source to desti‑
nation nodes. The objective of the TP is to determine the minimal shipping 
cost while satisfying supply and demand limits. These parameters cost, 
demand and supply are not always defined as precise numbers due to the 
incertitude of the industrial environment in real‑life applications. To get 
around this circumstance of vagueness the concept of fuzziness was intro‑
duced by Zadeh (1965) and if the parameters of the TP are represented by 
fuzzy numbers, then it becomes a fuzzy transportation problem (FTP).
According to Ebrahimnejad and Verdegay (2018), FTP can be classified 
to four classes as follows:
•	 FTP‑Type 1: only the transportation cost is considered a fuzzy number.
•	 FTP‑Type 2: both the supply and the demand are considered as fuzzy 
numbers as well as decision variables.
•	 FTP‑Type 3: transportation cost, supply and demand quantities are 
fuzzy.
•	 FTP‑Type 4: all model parameters (cots, supply and demand) as well 
as decision variables are presented with fuzzy numbers.
This research paper presents the first adaptation of the novel heuris‑
tic Dhouib‑Matrix‑TP1 (DM‑TP1) to solve the triangular FTP where all 
parameters are fuzzy (FTP‑type 3). In the first step, triangular fuzzy num‑
bers are converted to crisp numbers using the score function. Then, the 
DM‑TP1 heuristic is extended to solve the FTP. The paper is organized as 
follows. In Section 10.2, a literature review of TP under a fuzzy environ‑
ment is presented. In Section 10.3, the fundamental concept of triangular 
fuzzy and suitable ranking functions is given. In Section 10.4, the proposed 

Application of the greedy Dhouib-matrix-TP1 method  205
method is discussed. In Section 10.5, a stepwise application of a numerical 
example is illustrated with a comparison of the generated result to other 
methods from the literature, and in Section 10.6, the paper is concluded.
10.2  RELATED WORK
In recent years, several techniques are adopted for solving the TP in a fuzzy 
environment. A novel ranking method to convert Fermatean fuzzy number 
to crisp number in full FTP is designed (Sahoo, 2021). The unbalanced TP 
where all parameters are presented as octagonal fuzzy number is optimized 
(Muthukumara et al., 2021). A new procedure FTP based on the study of 
the median transforms this problem into an exquisite value problem to find 
a minimal transport cost (Srinivasan et al., 2021). A new approach to solve, 
compare and estimate the costs of triangular, heptagonal and pentagonal 
numbers with the application of the Lagrange polynomial is used for FTP 
(Mhaske and Bondar, 2020). Later, a new method to solve fuzzy trapezoi‑
dal TP is presented (George et al., 2020). A conventional one‑point model 
to optimize fuzzy trapezoidal TP is proposed (Bisht and Srivastava, 2019). 
A new approach is established for the minimization of transport costs of 
FTP by classification of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and it is presented by 
Kasilingam and Subramanian (2018). A new distance ranking technique 
for converting the PTF to umber is net worth is proposed by Karthikeyan 
and Mohamed (2016). A new fuzzy demand and supply ranking method 
with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is used for FTP (Balasubramanian and 
Subramanian, 2018). A new λ‑cut technique based on the classification 
with fuzzy numbers is proposed for the resolution of FTP (Hunwisai and 
Kumam, 2017). A new approach for solving FTP by converting this prob‑
lem into a linear programming problem based on the Monte Carlo method 
by the use of triangular fuzzy random numbers is applied (Bondar and 
Mhaske, 2017). A new process fuzzy variable classification approach with 
trapezoidal numbers to convert FTP to a net problem is proposed by Malini 
and Ananthanarayanan (2016). A new approach for solving FTP where cost 
coefficients are fuzzy numbers while demands and supplies are net num‑
bers is presented (Khalaf, 2014). A new FTP resolution approach based 
on the heptagonal classification of fuzzy numbers using the ambiguity and 
value parameters is established (Rathi and Balamohan, 2014). A simplex 
algorithm named Arsham Khan is applied for solving FTP with imprecise 
requirements (Samuel and Gani, 2011). A new method to optimize FTP 
based on optimal more‑for‑less solution with mixed constraints based on 
zero fuzziness is applied in strategic decision‑making notions (Pandian and 
Natarajan, 2010a). A new method named fuzzy zero point is used for solving 
FTP with trapezoidal fuzzy number parameters (Pandian and Nagarajan, 
2010b). A novel ranking function to convert trapezoidal number to crisp 
one for TP is developed (Abbasbandy and Hajjari, 2009).

206  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
A new technique for classifying and comparing triangular fuzzy numbers 
to find a good solution for the FTP which is based on determining the area 
of a trapezium, a rectangle and a centroid at prominent places using the cut‑
ting method is used (Deshmuk et al., 2021). The TP where supply, demand 
and cost are presented as triangular fuzzy numbers is solved through a new 
method (Srinivasan et al., 2020). A new algorithm for solving the fuzzy TP 
using a new ranking approach based on the total integral value (Sam’an 
and Farikhin, 2020). The TP with the modern zero suffix method under 
a fuzzy environment is solved (Dinagar and Keerthivasan, 2020). A solu‑
tion for FTP with triangular fuzzy numbers implicated ranking function 
to solve problems project schedules, assignment problems and network 
flow problems using imprecise transportation costs is developed (Kumar 
and Subramanian, 2018). The resolution of FTP with a new technique on 
the lexicographical order of triangular fuzzy numbers with three‑objective 
functions is proposed (Ebrahimnejad, 2017). A new method is established 
for the resolution of the FTP with triangular fuzzy numbers to reach a 
minimal cost of transporting products with a capacitive network with four 
fuzzy numbers which are supply, demand, capacity and cost is developed 
(Srinivasan et al., 2016). An improved two‑step method for solving the FTP 
with non‑negative triangular fuzzy numbers by using fuzzy arithmetic to 
convert the FTP to linear programming with fuzzy costs and constraints 
net then decompose it to transform it to net bounded TP (Ebrahimnejad, 
2015). A new method proposed for FTP resolution with parameters (cost, 
availability and demand) in symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers according 
to Vogel’s algorithms is proposed (Nareshkumar and Ghuru, 2014).
10.3  FUNDAMENTAL OF FUZZY SET THEORY
In 1962, Zadeh introduced the term fuzzy (Zadeh, 1965), and in this sec‑
tion, we will introduce some details about the fuzzy concept inspired from 
the work of Bellman and Zadeh (1970) and Ross (2004).

10.4  PROCEDURE OF DHOUIB‑MATRIX‑TP1 (DM‑TP1)
The DM‑TP1 is a greedy heuristic based on several rules to orient the 
research towards a good initial basic feasible solution. The heuris‑
tic DM‑TP1 is one of several methods proposed in the concept of DM. 
Considering the optimization of the Travelling Salesman Problem in certain 
and uncertain environment, the new heuristics DM‑TSP1 and DM‑TSP2 
are proposed based on the concept of DM (Dhouib, 2021d–l; Dhouib and 
Dhouib, 2021; Dhouib et al., 2021; Dhouib, 2022a; Dhouib et al., 2022). 
Correspondingly, another novel heuristic is designed (through the idea of 
DM) entitled DM‑AP1 to solve the assignment problem (Dhouib, 2022b; 
Dhouib, 2023a; Dhouib and Sutikno, 2023). Moreover, for large instances 
new metaheuristics are proposed via the theory of DM, such as DM‑3 and 
DM‑4 introduced, respectively (Dhouib et al., 2021; Dhouib and Zouari, 
2023) and (Dhouib, 2022c; Dhouib and Pezer, 2022; Dhouib, 2023b).
The novel heuristic DM‑TP1 is introduced firstly (Dhouib, 2021a) to solve 
TP with crisp parameters. Moreover, DM‑TP1 is enhanced to optimize 

208  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
TP under the neutrosophic domain (Dhouib, 2021b) and trapezoidal FTP 
(Dhouib, 2021c). Figure  10.1 depicts the nine steps of DM‑TP1, where 
step 1, step 2 and step 9 are executed only once and the other steps are 
repeated n + m iterations. A stepwise application of DM‑TP1 will be given 
in the next section. For more details on the theory of DM‑TP1, we suggest 
the reader to refer (Dhouib, 2021a–c).
10.5  NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
Consider the following example taken from Sikkannan (2021), where three 
origin nodes (F1, F2 and F3) will cover the demands of three destination 
nodes (W1, W2 and W3). Figure 10.2 depicts the corresponding param‑
eters (cost, supply and demand) for this problem represented as a triangular 
fuzzy number.
Figure 10.1  The nine steps of DM‑TP1.

Application of the greedy Dhouib-matrix-TP1 method  209
The first step is to convert the triangular fuzzy numbers into crisp num‑
bers using Eq. (10.2):

10.5.1  Iteration 1
Compute the (Average‑Min) function for each row, place the result in the 
AMSR at the last column, repeat that for each column and put the result in 
the AMDC (Figure 10.4). Next, identify the highest element (with the value 
3 in column 2) among AMSR and AMDC and find the minimal element in 
the column (1.5 at position x12). Hence, affect the smallest value between 
supply 7.5 and demand 10.5 (which is 7.5) and discard the saturated param‑
eter (row 1).
10.5.2  Iteration 2
Similarly, compute the values of AMSR and AMDC (Figure 10.5). Then, 
select the highest element (with the value 2.5 in column 2) among AMSR 
and AMDC and find the minimal element in the column (3.5 at position 
x22). Next, affect the smallest value 3 and discard the saturated parameter 
(column 2).

10.5.3  Iteration 3
Once more, compute the values of AMSR and AMDC (Figure 10.6). Then, 
select the highest element (with the value 1.5 in column 3) among AMSR 
and AMDC and find the minimal element in the column (2.5 at position 
x23). Next, affect the smallest value 3 and discard the saturated parameter 
(row 2).
Figure 10.5  Discard row 1.
Figure 10.6  Select the smallest element in column 3.

212  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
10.5.4  Iteration 4
Another time, compute the values of AMSR and AMDC (Figure 10.7). Then, 
select the highest element (with the value 0.5 in row 3) among AMSR and 
AMDC and find the minimum in the column (4.5 at position x31). Next, 
affect the smallest value 5.5 and discard the saturated parameter (column 1).
10.5.5  Iteration 5
Yet again, compute the values of AMSR and AMDC (Figure 10.8). Then, 
select the highest element (with the value 0.0 in row 3) among AMSR and 
AMDC, and find the minimum in the column (5.5 at position x33). Next, 
affect the smallest value 3 and discard the saturated parameter (row 3).
All columns are discarded then a minimal transportation solution is gen‑
erated (see Figure 10.9) and its corresponding cost is calculated as follows:

transportation plan in real life.

Figure 10.11 compares the results obtained by different methods to the 
result of DM‑TP1. The proposed method DM‑TP1 finds a better solution 
for all methods and concurrent (same result) to the result found by the 
method proposed by Sikkannan (2021). However, DM‑TP1 is the faster 
viewing that needs only m + n iterations.

10.6  CONCLUSION
In this paper, the novel heuristic DM‑TP1 is enhanced for the first time 
to solve the TP where cost demand and supply are represented as trian‑
gular fuzzy numbers. DM‑TP1 is a very rapid method of viewing that 
it needs only (n + m) iterations to generate the optimal or near‑optimal 
transportation plan. DM‑TP1 is effective and easy to understand and 
can be applied for solving real‑life problems. The results generated from 
the numerical comparisons prove the performance of DM‑TP1 compared 
with the existing techniques. Further research will deal with the applica‑
tion of DM‑TP1 on other fuzzy membership functions and aims to invent 
a new ranking function.

11.1  INTRODUCTION: SHORTEST PATH 
PROBLEMS IN A FUZZY ENVIRONMENT
A mathematical method for analyzing relationships between objects and 
resolving network issues is called graph theory (node). Due to its fundamen‑
tal characteristics and a wide variety of applications, shortest path problem 
(SPP) plays a crucial role in combinatorial optimization. In communication, 
computer networks, manufacturing systems, and transportation, finding the 
shortest paths is crucial. The path’s weight will serve as a representation of 
the amount of time needed to convey something from one end to the other, 
or from the source to the destination. By reducing the distances between 
some pairs of suppliers and destinations and by speeding up some of the 
routes, the transmission’s efficiency can be raised. The entire cost should 
be lower to meet the demands of the speedup, and some cost is required 
to reduce travel time by enhancing the road conditions for faster travel [1]. 
Every SPP has a set of specifications for the supplier and leaf node that cor‑
respond to a quantity such as time, the quantity of goods a truck may carry, 
or the duration of a break. The limitations on the resource will be given in 
the form of intervals that restrict the range of values it can consider at each 
node along the path. It is possible to encrypt SPP using a complete graph as 
an assignment problem. The system of transport management must be able 
to provide the quickest route between a specific source node and the ter‑
minal node. Instead of indicating distances in terms of geography, the arc 
lengths are stimulated to reflect the time or expense of transportation. For 
a setting with uncertainty, the use of fuzzy numbers is a viable strategy. The 
defuzzification function is used to convert fuzzy numbers into crisp num‑
bers, which are then frequently employed in optimization techniques. SPP

is not bound by a geometric distance. The trip time between cities, despite 
it being fixed, might be represented by a fuzzy variable. Since practically 
all communication and transportation networks include unpredictably 
weighted arcs, it is impossible to create clear graphs using this information. 
The fuzzy shortest path problem was first successfully solved by Dubois 
and Prade. Finding the SP to the directed graph and its primary format 
incapable of representing the circumstances where the value of the detached 
function should be is the most significant combinatorial optimization chal‑
lenge. The most significant combinatorial optimization problem is to iden‑
tify the SP to the directed graph and its basic structure that is incapable of 
depicting situations in which the result of the disconnected function cannot 
be determined just by the choice of each single arc.
In a murky circumstance, Rosenfeld [2] explained the idea of graph the‑
ory. Researchers also defined fuzzy graph operations and types, such as 
complements of fuzzy graphs, regular fuzzy graphs, etc. Intuitionistic fuzzy 
sets (IFS) were described by Atanassov [3] as a generalized fuzzy set with 
active and inactive membership categories. The fact that a fuzzy set’s ele‑
ments have a membership value distinguishes it from a normal set. Zadeh 
made the discovery [4]. Shannon et Atanassov developed the theory of the 
intuitionistic fuzzy graphs [5]. Jun and Lee [6] presented cubic ideals in 
semigroups. Jun et al. [7] presented a publication of closed cubic ideals and 
cubic‑subalgebras in BCK/BCI algebras. Jun et al. [8] presented BCI alge‑
braic cubic q‑ideas. Cubic structures were used to apply BCI algebras and 
other ideals [9,10].
In a directed graph with each edge’s cost represented by a trapezoidal 
intuitionistic fuzzy number (TrIFN), the most generalized form of trap‑
ezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs), consisting of degree of acceptance and 
degree of rejection, Baba [11] presented an algorithm to find an intuition‑
istic fuzzy shortest path (IFSP). To find the IFSP, the suggested method 
employs the induced intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy order weighted geo‑
metric (I‑ITFOWG) operator (IFSP). Gani and Jabarulla [12] used an intu‑
itionistic fuzzy number rather than a fuzzy number to denote each arc 
length when describing the shortest path in a directed graph. In a network 
flow problem, Meenakshi and Kaliraja [13] determined the shortest path in 
interval‑valued fuzzy networks. As an extension of the spherical fuzzy set, 
Jun and Khan et al. [14] suggested the idea of the cubical fuzzy set. In 2013, 
Cuong [15] debated using picture fuzzy sets. In 2014, Das and De [16] 
presented the shortest path problem in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. 
Based on interval valued, fuzzy SPP, Elizabeth and Sujatha [1] discussed 
fuzzy number matrices.
Yager [17] established a class of non‑standard Pythagorean fuzzy subsets 
with membership grades of pairs (a, b) meeting the condition. Khorsandi 
et al. [18], suggested the simplest method for determining the fuzzy shortest 

An approach toward shortest path problems  221
path (fuzzy shortest distance) between the source node and the destination 
node. The method required less time since it only considered the nodes that 
needed to travel to the destination node and excluded all other nodes from 
consideration.
Broumi et al. [19] presented a paper describing the use of the Dijkstra 
method to resolve the interval‑valued neutrosophic shortest path problem. 
An interval type 2 fuzzy set with the shortest path problem was given by 
Dey et al. [20].
Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs), which may handle ambiguous information 
more easily throughout the decision‑making process, were introduced by 
Senapati and Yager [21,22]. They defined basic operations over ferma‑
tean fuzzy sets. They compare and contrast the drawbacks of Pythagorean 
fuzzy sets with intuitionistic fuzzy sets. They focused on the complement 
operator of fermatean fuzzy sets and established the fundamental set of 
operations for fermatean fuzzy sets. Another thing that was looked at was 
an Euclidean separation between two fermatean fuzzy sets. They devel‑
oped a fermatean fuzzy weighted product model to handle the problem of 
multi‑criteria decision‑making.
Jan et al. [23] made some progress in fuzzy graph theory. An original pro‑
posal for a T‑spherical fuzzy graph is presented as a characteristic shared 
by fuzzy graphs, intuitionistic fuzzy graphs, and picture fuzzy graphs. This 
idea’s uniqueness, importance, and significance are demonstrated by show‑
ing some findings, giving examples, and employing graphical analysis. In this 
section, terms like a T‑spherical fuzzy subgraph, a complement of T‑SFG, 
and degree of T‑SFG are defined and their attributes are described. Sahoo 
[24] proposed specific score functions for the fermatean fuzzy TOPSIS tech‑
nique and the effective ranking of fermatean fuzzy sets on the basis of pro‑
posed score functions. The authors have proposed three newly improved 
ranking score systems for fermatean fuzzy sets. Mahmood et al. [25] dis‑
cussed about multi‑criteria decisions based on the cubic set. Thamizhendhi 
et al. [26] defined the concept of Fermatean fuzzy hypergraph.
A new matrix technique for minimal spanning trees with undirected 
interval‑valued neutrosophic graphs was suggested, as per Broumi et  al. 
[27]. Dey et al. [28] presented a genetic approach for tackling fuzzy short‑
est path issues with interval type‑2 fuzzy arc lengths. Solving shortest path 
problem using the Dijkstra algorithm in interval‑valued fuzzy sets (IVFs), 
Enayattabar et  al. [29] demonstrated a fuzzy Pythagorean environment. 
Using t‑norm operations, Kaur and Garg [30] developed generalized cubic 
intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators and applied them to group deci‑
sion‑making processes. Research works related to authors toward shortest 
path problems under various fuzzy environments are shown in Table 11.1.

Basically, picture fuzzy sets‑based models may be adequate in situ‑
ations when we face human opinions involving more answers of type: 
yes, abstain, no, and refusal. Obeying can be a good example of such 
a situation as the students may be divided into four groups of those 
who: Obey for, abstain, Obey against, and refusal of the rules.

defined by a function α: X → F, where F = [0, 1]. Denote FK as the col‑
lection of all fuzzy sets in X.
	
x.	Interval number: A closed subinterval d =  [d−, d+] of F where F = [0, 1] 
is called an interval number, where 0 ≤ d− ≤ d+ ≤ 1. The set of all interval 
numbers is denoted by [F]. Let X be a non‑empty set. A function β: 
X → [F] is called an IVF in X. Let [F]K denotes the set of all IVF sets 
in X. For each I ∈ [F]K and x ∈ X, I(x) = [I−(x), I+(x)] is called the degree 
of membership of an element x to I, where I−: X → F and I+: X → F are 
fuzzy sets in X, which are defined as lower fuzzy set and upper fuzzy

applied to compare the grades of cubical fuzzy sets (CFSs). These 
functions show that the greater is the value, the greater is the CFSs 
and by using this concept paths can be ranked. Let A

11.3  OBJECTIVES OF THIS WORK
The main objectives of this research are as follows:
	
1.	To define an arithmetic operations on CFN.
	
2.	To present a scoring function system for a Cubical fuzzy graph, as 
well as an algorithm for solving issues utilizing this idea.
	
3.	Test the suggested method using a real‑world example.
This chapter might inspire scholars to examine a variety of real‑world issues 
using the recommended algorithm.

An approach toward shortest path problems  227
11.4  ALGORITHM FOR THE PROPOSED METHOD
This section proposes a technique to find the shortest path from each node 
to its predecessor. This approach can be used to locate the shortest path in 
a network in real‑world situations.
Step 1:
Choose v
vn
and 
1
 as the destination’s first and last nodes, 
respectively.
Step 2:
Since node 1 is not separated from itself, let us assume that 
=
d
 
0,1
1
. Additionally, indicate the initial node as ( 0, 1 , −).
Step 3:
Look for 
{
}
=
⊕
d
d
d
j
i
ij
min
. For j = 2, 3, …, n. We use the accu‑
racy function since the numbers are CFNs.

Step 4:
If a unique i = r is encountered when the distance value occurs. 
j is thus designated as 

d r
j,
. If there is no unique match between 
the distance measurements. It represents many CFN pathways that 
originate from a node. So, use the accuracy function of CFNs to 
find the shortest path out of multiple options.
Step 5:
The shortest distance between the beginning and final nodes, 
given that [
]
d
k
n,
 is the label of the destination node, is dn.
Step 6:
Since the label for the destination node is [
]
d
k
n,
. Therefore, we 
check the label of node k to determine the CFN shortest path from 
the first node to the last node. Let [
]
d
l
n,
 stand. Next, we exam‑
ine the nodel’s label, and so on. To get the first node, repeat this 
procedure.
Step 7:
Consequently, step 6 can be used to determine the CFN shortest 
path.
11.5  NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
Take into account the network based on CFG in Figure 11.1 where the CFN 
connects the vertices. The shortest path is determined using the suggested 
method as follows.

228  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
In Table 11.2, CFNs are used to describe the route between each pair of 
nodes.
Now, using the outlined approach, we find the shortest path as follows:
The destination node being 6, n is equal to 6. If we set 
=
d
0,1
1
 and 
designate node 1 as the source node ( 0, 1 , −), we can find dj as follows:
Iteration 1:
Since node 2 has only one predecessor, we set I = 1 and j = 2, 
which results in d
 
2 as:

when i = 1, the minimum value is reached. Vertex 2 is therefore 
marked as [ 0.7, 0.4, 0.1 , −1].

11.6  CONCLUSION
Conventional SP problems need accurate arc weights, which are not usu‑
ally available in real‑world situations. The current study investigates the 
shortest path issue with cubical fuzzy arc costs. The SP issue was initially 
articulated in the cubical fuzzy environment. We compared the costs of 
several pathways using an existing enhanced scoring function, with their 
arc costs represented by CFNs. We described the cubical fuzzy shortest

path optimality requirements for the SP issue under discussion using this 
enhanced scoring function. The standard technique has been expanded to 
compute the CF cost and related CFSP of the shortest path. This study 
develops an algorithm for determining the shortest path in a network with 
nodes that take the form of CFNs. The proposed methodology is being 
used to handle a numerical example where the shortest path in a net‑
work is determined among all possibilities. In the future, we plan to use 
the method to solve more intricate network problems with both positive 
and negative CF costs. The technique described for addressing SP issues in 
an interval‑valued cubical fuzzy (IVCF) environment may be expanded to 
solve them in a generalized cubical fuzzy environment [1,28]. Furthermore, 
the suggested approach for determining the IVCF shortest path between all 
pairs of nodes is deferred until the next research.

Different forms of linear 
dodecagonal fuzzy number 
and its application
L. Jeromia Anthvanet, M. Geethalakshmi,  
and A. Rajkumar
12.1  INTRODUCTION
The 1944 publication of Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by 
Princeton University Press [1], authored by economist Oscar Morgenstern 
and mathematician John von Neumann, is regarded as a seminal work in 
the development of the interdisciplinary field of game theory. The appen‑
dix of the second edition contains his derivation of expected utility from 
his axioms (1947). Considering that each person possesses the same prob‑
ability, Von Neumann and Morgenstern employed objective probabilities. 
Neumann and Morgenstern assert that they can offer a theory of subjective 
probability, nevertheless. This chapter [2] examines the reliability analysis 
of power loom plants using interval‑valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFS). 
Here, we outlined the power loom installation as an easily removable sys‑
tem with A (n) and B (m) mingled in series. The IVIFS [3] specified over 
the universe of discourse [0, 1] is presumed to be the reliability of unit Aʼs 
n constituents and unit Bʼs m constituents. In order to account for heredi‑
tary uncertainties in data gathering and dependability measurement of the 
hand‑loom configuration, the concluding system reliability is an IVIFS.
A few of the currently prevalent ambiguous regression models [4,5] entail 
different demands for the focus of the study, such as asserting that the sam‑
ples are balanced triangular fuzzy numbers or applying non‑negative bounds 
on the estimated coefficients. We advocate left‑right fuzzy regression in this 
chapter that can be used with diverse forms of datasets, which represents 
the fuzzy distance [6–8] – the average fuzzy distance between the observed 
and projected quantities as the averaged fuzzy failure, then trying to apply 
the mean faulty inaccuracy to the minimal to yield the regression increase 
coefficients. and incomplete scale between two left‑right fuzzy numbers. To 
evaluate how well the suggested method performs in comparison to other 
methods, we use two criteria: average fuzzy error [9] (comparative average 
fuzzy error based on partial order) and Sum of Squared Errors (SSE). In 
order to show the viability and broad applicability of the suggested method, 
we conclude by providing four different types of numerical examples.

Different forms of linear dodecagonal fuzzy number  235
The fuzzified matrix game, a two‑player zero‑sum match with a vague 
reward, is taken into consideration in this article [10]. He introduces 
three kinds of minimax steady state conceptions and studies their pecu‑
liarities for these games, which have been predicated on fuzzy maximal 
arrangement. As a series of bi‑matrix parameterized games with sharp 
payoffs, these stationary techniques [11] are first showed to be Nash 
equilibrium strategies. Furthermore, we analyze the value qualities of 
the fuzzy matrix game using the possibility and inevitability metrics. 
Additionally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the utility of 
our approach”. This contribution [12] describes a general fuzzy trans‑
port problem model. Introduce octagonal fuzzy numbers and develop a 
new model to solve this problem. This is the case when defining octago‑
nal fuzzy number [13] rankings. It is possible to compare them and use 
it to transform fuzzy values. The fuzzy optimal value is the transport 
problem when solved with octagonal fuzzy numbers has many conse‑
quences optimal value than solve using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. It is 
illustrated using a numerical example by Basirzadeh [3].
Given the significant exposure of various interval‑weighted fuzzy numbers 
in neothelic investigations, they investigated different policies of inter‑
val‑weighted pentagonal fuzzy numbers in conjunction with tuples mem‑
bership functions (MFs) in this chapter [14]. In order to explain the rigidity 
and polarity of pentagonal fuzzy structures, the concept of MF is also 
somewhat generalized to quadratic MFs. As a result, level sets were built for 
both linear and nonlinear MF. Alternative approaches and a selection pro‑
cedure, which are also components of this framework, were used to achieve 
defuzzification. The intelligence created is incorporated in game situations 
using his PFNʼs parameters, which ultimately opens up new possibilities for 
modeling real‑world issues and improves how parameter uncertainties are 
handled during the evaluation process.
Fuzzy number rankings play an important role in optimization tech‑
niques [15] such as mapping problems, transportation problems, project 
planning, network flow analysis, and uncertain environments in organi‑
zational economics. In this chapter, we present a new ranking technique 
based on hexagons and fuzzy numbers focused on triangles and rectangles. 
“This is how the new ranking method makes hexagonal fuzzy numbers 
crisp number”.
This chapter [16] presents a novel approach to solve a two‑person 
zero‑sum matrix game combining player fuzzy tactics and fuzzy payoffs. 
A pair of unique linear programming models, one for each player, are cre‑
ated using a fuzzy triangular optimization algorithm. An example using 
numbers is used to show every improved method for each player. It visu‑
ally displays a simulation study on numerous gameplay quality and player 
strategy‑related elements.

236  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
12.2  MOTIVATION
The building of mathematical models, complicated engineering problems, 
and problems with medical diagnostics, among other things, depend criti‑
cally on how ambiguity is perceived. There will now be a crucial question: 
What is the mathematical figure and how a Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number 
symmetric linear form would be, if one were to think about it? We truly 
endeavor to build this research piece from this perspective. Later, we devel‑
oped some more intriguing findings regarding the defuzzification methods 
of the symmetric linear form of a Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number.
12.2.1  Contribution
In this explorative study, we have perceptualized the notion of Dodecagonal 
Fuzzy Number in linear form. We have introduced the MFs of Linear 
Dodecagonal Number in symmetric and asymmetric forms, Interval‑Valued 
Linear Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number in symmetric and asymmetric forms. We 
have explored the α‑cut parametric representations of Linear Dodecagonal 
Number in symmetric and asymmetric forms, Interval‑Valued Linear 
Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number in symmetric and asymmetric forms. Various 
defuzzification methods are solved using dodecagonal fuzzy number. They are 
as follows: (i) Center of Area Method, (ii) Average of α‑cut method, (iii) Bounded 
Area Method, and (iv) Mean of Removal of the Bounded Area Method.
To meet the needs of modeling problems, complicated engineering prob‑
lems, problems with inconsistent information, problems oriented to medical 
diagnosis, and operations research problems, the exploration of this num‑
ber will be an answer to all the critical situations. The researchers found it 
interesting to explore the possibilities of the usage of fuzzy number which 
is in symmetrical and non‑symmetrical nature. In this scenario, we have 
taken an assignment problem in Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number domain, in 
which it is resolved using the defuzzification methods explored.
12.2.2  Novelties
Many forms of exploration of fuzzy numbers have been done by many 
researchers and academicians. In this paper, we have brought out major 
interesting facts and discoveries of a fuzzy number with 12 parameters. 
They are as follows:
•	 Introduced the linear forms of Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number with both 
symmetric and asymmetric nature.
•	 The graphical representation of all forms of Dodecagonal Fuzzy 
Number.

•	 Discovery of defuzzification methods like the Center of Area Method, 
Average of α‑Cut Method, Bounded Area Method, and Mean of 
removal of Bounded Area Method.
•	 Implementation of Assignment Problem.

12.7  LIMITATIONS OF THE WORK
The research work has been clearly done on studying the complete form of a 
number. The number taken for the study contains 12 parameters. The attri‑
butes can be well confined if the problem undergoes with 12 parameters. 
Real‑life problems which have lack information cannot be dealt with the 
proposed number. Finding a solution for such kind of problems becomes 
impossible (Tables 12.1–12.4).

Different forms of linear dodecagonal fuzzy number  255
12.8  FUTURE DIRECTION
The newly proposed linear and non‑linear forms of the number are left open 
for young researchers to apply and find a solution to problems in real‑time 
fields like engineering, prediction analysis, image processing techniques, 
neural network problems, stock market exchange prediction, production 
analysis prediction, and so on. The study gives way for many researchers to 
explore the newly found linear and non‑linear representation with symmet‑
ric and asymmetric properties in various real‑time problems for attaining 
better solutions.
12.9  CONCLUSION
We have explored the notion of deeply analyzing the characteristics and 
nature of a Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number. Furthermore, we have done 
an elaborative study on expanding the same number to Interval‑Valued 
Dodecagonal Fuzzy Number having a linear form. The α‑cut parametric 
representations with symmetric and asymmetric properties have also been 
studied. The deep study has led us to a clear understanding of a Dodecagonal 
Fuzzy Number and its behavior. Various defuzzification strategies have 
been found for the new number. The inventions and explorations of the 
new formula have been best illustrated by an example assignment problem 
with all defuzzification techniques.

Different forms of non‑linear 
dodecagonal fuzzy number 
and its application
L. Jeromia Anthvanet, M. Geethalakshmi, 
and A. Rajkumar
13.1  INTRODUCTION
Cheng (1998) has proposed a ranking procedure for problems that 
are unreasonable. They have proposed a method with a co‑efficient of 
­variation which is an improvisation of Lee and Li’s method. Deng Feng 
Li et al. (2010) have introduced triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number. 
A ranking method called value and ambiguity index methods have been 
proposed having triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers as values. A com‑
parison has been done with the existing methods to prove the strength of 
the proposed method. Angela M. Coxe and Clifford A. Reiter (2003) have 
done an elaborative study on the patterns and symmetry of snowflakes. 
They also have concentrated on the growth of the snowflakes which are 
indeterministic in nature and the issue has been addressed in this regard. 
Salim Rezvani (2013) has considered the usage of trapezoidal intuitionis‑
tic fuzzy number in decision‑making. The belongingness and non‑belong‑
ingness values are calculated using the value index and ambiguity index. 
K. Dhurai and A. Karpagam (2016) have introduced the hexagonal fuzzy 
number membership function. The fuzzy arithmetic operations have been 
studied in detail. The α‑cut properties have been used in these arithmetic 
calculations. Ghadle and Pathade have found a solution to a transpor‑
tation problem with Generalized Hexagonal and Generalized Octagonal 
Fuzzy Number. A ranking method has been used using the proposed num‑
bers. Namarta et al., have solved uncertainty game problems using dode‑
cagonal fuzzy number. The crisp value has been changed into a fuzzy 
game problem and a solution is found. Jiuying Dong and Shu‑Ping Wan 
(2016) have introduced interval‑valued intuitionistic linguistic variables, 
and using these methods, they have introduced weighted arithmetic oper‑
ators and weighted geometric operators. These formulas are being used in 
the lexicographic method. Mohammed Shapique and Jesuraj (2017) have 
implied pentagonal intuitionistic fuzzy number to find a solution to fuzzy 
differential equations. The values for belongingness and non‑belonging‑
ness is calculated which is the significant importance of the chapter.

13.2  DEFINITION OF FUZZY SET
“A fuzzy set is a pair (U, m) where U is a set (often required to be non‑empty) 
and U → [0,1] is a membership function. The reference set U (sometimes 
denoted by ω
X
 or  
) is called universe of discourse, and for each ∈
x
U
 
, the 
value m(x) is called the grade of membership of x in (U, m). The function 
µ
=
m
A is called the membership function of the fuzzy set A = (U, m)”. “For 
a finite set

Applications of vague

Mary Tency E. L. and Helen M.
14.1  INTRODUCTION
In 1965, the theory for dealing the uncertainties which is the concept of 
fuzzy sets was introduced by Zadeh [4]. The theory of fuzzy topology was 
initiated by Chang [2] in 1968. The concept of vague sets was first devel‑
oped by Gau and Buehrer [3].

14.3  VAGUE TRANSPORTATION MODEL
A simplified presentation of a new computing procedure for solving the vague 
transportation problem was presented. To design the algorithm, we have 
described the vague arithmetic and numerical conditions in three different 
models through the vague approach. We have extended the initial basic feasi‑
ble solution and then used an existing optimality test called the stepping stone 
method to obtain the cost of transportation. To justify the proposed method, 
a few numerical experiments are given to show the effectiveness of the new 
model, and the solution is presented in the way of the vague bipartite graph.
14.3.1  Algorithm for solving the three different 
types of vague transportation models
Step 1: To solve the vague transportation problem.
	
a.	If it is Type I vague transportation problem, then calculate the de-
fuzzified value of each vague cost and replace all the vague cost with 
its de-fuzzified value to obtain the classical transportation problem.
	
b.	If it is Type II vague transportation problem, then calculate the de-
fuzzified value of each vague supply and demand unit and replace 
all the vague supply and demand units with its de-fuzzified value to 
obtain the classical transportation problem.
	
c.	If it is Type III vague transportation problem, then calculate the de-
fuzzified value of each vague cost, vague supply and vague demand 
unit and replace all the vague cost, vague supply and vague demand 
unit with its de-fuzzified value to obtain the classical transportation 
problem.

Step 2: To check the balance of a transportation problem, we use 
∑
∑

demand = supply. If demand is not equal to supply, then add a dummy 
variable on demand/supply and make it a balanced transportation 
problem.
Step 3: To find the initial basic feasible solution, use the Penalty method 
as shown in Algorithm 14.1.
Step 4: Convert the transportation problem into the crisp transportation 
problem by using

Step 5: Test the optimality of the transportation problem by the stepping 
stone method as shown in Algorithm 14.2.
Step 6: Using the objective function, get the minimum transportation 
cost.
Algorithm 14.1
A penalty method to find an initial basic feasible solution:
Step 1: Consider the problem from Step 1 of the main algorithm.
Step 2: Calculate the difference between the minimum and the next min-
imum of the transportation costs and denote it as a penalty.
Step 3: In the row/column, corresponding to the maximum penalty, make 
the allotment in the cell having the minimum transportation cost.
Step 4: If the maximum penalty corresponds to: 
Case 1: If there exists more than one row, select the topmost row,
Case 2: If there exists more than one column, then select the left-most 
column.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until all the supplies and the demands are 
satisfied.
Algorithm 14.2
A stepping stone method to test the optimality condition:
Step 1: Consider the LP model problem from Step 4 in Algorithm 14.1.
Step 2: To find the optimal solution using the stepping stone method, use 
the below algorithm.

14.3.3  Type II vague transportation 
model (T-II-VT model)
Consider a transportation problem with the conditions unit costs as crisp 
values, but the demands and supplies are in vague values. The problem is 
given in Table 14.6.
Calculate the de-fuzzified value for each vague transportation demand 
and supplie by using (2) and obtain a crisp transportation problem.
The given Type II problem is an unbalanced vague transportation prob-
lem, so we add a dummy row with the zero cost and make it as a balanced 
vague transportation problem. 
The de-fuzzified vague transportation problem is given in Table 14.7.
The initial basic feasible solution by Vogel’s Approximation method is 
given in Table 14.8.

14.3.4  Type III vague transportation 
model (T-III-VT model)
Consider a transportation problem with the conditions unit costs as crisp 
values, but the demands and supplies are in vague values. The problem is 
given in Table 14.11.
Calculate the de-fuzzified value for each vague transportation unit costs, 
demands, and supplies by using (2) and obtain a crisp transportation problem.
The given Type III problem is a balanced vague transportation problem.
The de-fuzzified vague transportation problem is given in Table 14.12.

∴ This solution is non-degenerate.
To find the optimality test, we use the stepping stone method and we cre‑
ate a closed loop for unoccupied cells, thus we get Table 14.
Since all net cost change ≥0, so final optimal solution is arrived in

14.4  CONCLUSION
Vague sets being a generalization of fuzzy sets provide a possibility to 
­represent the membership and non-membership functions with the means of 
uncertainty. Though there are many transportation problems that have been 
studied with different types of input data, this research has investigated the 
solutions to transportation problems in a vague environment. Three ­different 
models in vague environment were considered in the study. The proposed 
algorithms concretely analyze the solutions to vague ­transportation prob‑
lems to obtain the minimum transportation cost, and one of the solutions is 
obtained and represented by the vague bipartite graph.

A fuzzy Ishikawa diagram 
to represent and evaluate 
the quality of education

15.1  INTRODUCTION
One of the concepts of modern life that concerns almost every citizen on the 
planet is that of quality. This concept has had different definitions through‑
out history. At present, it is identified mainly with the results in production 
and services; however, daily, each one has an assessment of quality beyond 
these two aspects of contemporary human life.
Some formal definitions understand quality as full compliance with a 
set of pre-established requirements. Other definitions, including ISO 9000 
standards, define quality as customer satisfaction (ISO, 2006).
The conception of quality in this 21st century owes a lot to the Japanese 
school of this concept. It was the Japanese after World War II who absorbed, 
promoted, developed, and improved the ideas introduced by the Americans 
who were sent to the Asian country as quality advisers. Japan had lost the 
war and was a destroyed country that needed to be rebuilt but with low-
skilled labor.
Among the Japanese who received the American legacy of quality and 
who made very significant contributions is Kaoru Ishikawa, who was an 
industrial chemist, business administrator, and academic who is an essen‑
tial name to mention when talking about quality in the industry (Watson, 
2004). Among his contributions is the differentiation that he established 
between the Japanese and Western conceptions of work, due to cultural 
differences. The Japanese control of the total quality is characterized by the 
participation of all the members of the company to make it prosper, and 
for this end, they intervene from the senior managers to the lower-ranking 
employees. It is a less statistical total quality control than the Western style.
Also, K. Ishikawa designed easy-to-use tools in the field of industry, with 
the aim that they have simple but effective ways to measure the state of 
quality. These tools are based on the principle that a group of members 
of the company, those designated for it, will collectively and proactively 
analyze the factors that influence the quality of production, so that their 

290  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
positive modification contributes to the improvement of the quality of the 
product or service, following the principle of continuous improvement.
One such tool is the cause-effect diagram, also called the Ishikawa dia‑
gram, fishbone diagram, or herringbone diagram, named for its fishbone-like 
appearance. In this diagram, the “head of the fish” represents the problem 
to be solved, while the “bones” are lines that specify factors or causes that 
influence the problem. This is one of the seven basic quality tools.
There are other tools and other quality theories that can be extended 
to measure quality in education (Delahoz-Domínguez et al., 2022; Benty 
et al., 2023). However, the analogy between quality in the industry and 
education quality is at least non-trivial. This is because in the industry the 
objective is to satisfy the client’s expectation, but in education, it is neces‑
sary to define clearly the objective because the student is not a client. So, 
this is a controversial topic.
For example, in higher education worldwide, the idea has been estab‑
lished that the ranking of a university means that there is a higher quality 
in teaching; however, this is not necessarily true, because higher education 
centers have dedicated themselves to the publication of scientific articles, 
which does not mean that education quality is fulfilled in their classrooms.
Like the ISO 9000 standards that were drafted by the International 
Organization for Standardization, in the case of educational quality we 
will refer to what the United Nations documents say in the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO):
Quality is a core element of education that not only has an impact on 
what students learn but also on the way they learn and on the benefits 
they obtain from the instruction they receive. The search for means to 
ensure that students obtain decent school results and acquire values 
and skills that allow them to play a positive role in their societies is a 
topical issue in the education policies of the vast majority of countries.
(UNESCO, 2005)
They also add:
Governments that are currently striving to develop basic education 
have to face the following challenge: ensuring that students stay in 
school long enough to finish their studies and equip themselves with 
the necessary knowledge to face a rapidly changing world. The evalua‑
tions carried out show that this is not being achieved in many countries.
In other words, one of the basic principles of quality education is that it be 
an education for all, which implies accessibility to education by all citizens 
who are willing to study; also, it must consist of equity, not discrimination, 
and equal opportunities (Nikulin & Nakonechnay, 2022; Shcherbak et al., 
2022). Once the student is in school or university, he/she must have all the 
necessary means for effective learning, both in knowledge and ethics.

A fuzzy Ishikawa diagram  291
As Ishikawa proposed its diagram to improve the quality of the company 
or industry, in this chapter, we propose an Ishikawa Fuzzy diagram that 
helps not only with the representation of knowledge and analysis of quality, 
but also for quantitative or qualitative evaluation of the status of quality in 
school, university, or teaching within a region or country.
The Ishikawa diagram has been used to represent knowledge of health 
issues in the clinical specialty or in education itself (Artyukhov et al., 2021; 
Cheong-Wong, 2011). However, to the knowledge of the authors of this 
chapter, we have not found the term “Fuzzy Ishikawa Diagram” except 
for a book chapter, where a fuzzy membership function is obtained auto‑
matically, with a computer program which we do not know if we have free 
access, where we need various mathematical knowledge beyond the simplic‑
ity of the original diagram (Dorodnykh et al., 2020).
Briefly, before proceeding, it should be remembered that fuzzy logic (FL) 
introduced by Zadeh, assigns truth values between 0 and 1 to logical prop‑
ositions to indicate gradations in semantics, unlike classical mathematical 
logic where a proposition is either true (truth value 1) or false (truth value 0) 
(Jyh-Shing et al., 1997; Klement et al., 2000). This is one way to deal with 
the uncertainty of information. In addition, that allows us to take advantage 
of the vagueness of natural language for the construction of models. That is 
why when we link Ishikawa diagrams with a theory as powerful as FL, this 
new tool is enriched, without implying a significant loss of simplicity. On the 
other hand, the diagram gains in utility and allows us to link with the ben‑
efits of the models that deal with natural language. The tool proposed by us, 
unlike the others, is simple to use and is also easily automatable if desired.
This chapter is divided into a section of preliminary concepts where the 
main notions of FL, the Ishikawa diagram, and quality in education are 
recalled. Next, the details of the proposed model are presented and illus‑
trated with an example. In the end, the conclusions are explained.
15.2  PRELIMINARY CONCEPTS
In this section of the chapter, we make a brief reminder of the theories used 
in the design of the proposed tool. First of all, the concepts of education 
quality that appear in the most recent scientific literature will be explained.
15.2.1  State of the art of educational quality
According to the Carriazo-Díaz et al. (2020): “For the Ministry of National 
Education, quality education allows the formation of integral citizens with 
a high formation in values, with respect for the good of others and in pur‑
suit of social principles such as coexistence and peace. It affirms that a qual‑
ity education generates great opportunities for progress for society itself 
and therefore for the entire country.”

292  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
According to Maya et al. (2019): “To achieve quality in education, seg‑
mentation must be avoided, and on the contrary, the role of integration of 
education in an unequal context that seeks to develop an educational proj‑
ect for social transformation should be strengthened.”
Morales-Gomez et al. (2019) propose a “quality principle” whose purpose 
is to “incorporate into their existence the policy of continuous improvement 
and innovation in search of excellence,” following the criteria that “Quality 
and excellence are more attitudes than results; that is why they integrate 
mistakes into the learning process.”
In the case of Peru, especially in higher education, Aroquipa et al. (2019) 
point out that: “growth in education has a reason, which is to achieve the 
general and growing well-being of students, where individuals and fami‑
lies can experience a continuous improvement in their living conditions, 
while society as a whole sees its possibilities, opportunities, and capabilities 
increase and expand. Faced with this, it cannot be denied that there are 
factors against it; that impede improving the quality of life of people. On 
the one hand, the global economic reality and, in turn, how Peru is inserted 
into it, on the other hand, the historical features of our society such as mar‑
ginalization, cultural and racial discrimination, and particularly poverty.”
They also add: “Today the state university resumes quality actions obvi‑
ously required by licensing and accreditation, to strengthen measurement 
requirements, as well as those for analysis and improvement of projects 
under the six sigma methodology, which is consistent with this article since it 
is proposed to promote reflection on the processes of improvement of educa‑
tional quality that today’s society demands at all levels of education, as well 
as providing equal opportunities for all students in the country to achieve 
comprehensive training; in cognitive aspects, in the development of abilities 
and skills, as well as their attitude for intellectual and personal growth.”
15.2.2  Fuzzy logic
Fuzzy sets theory was published for the first time in the paper “Fuzzy Sets” 
authored by the Engineer and Mathematician Lofti Zadeh in “Information 
and Control” in 1965. A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of 
degrees of membership. Such a set is characterized by having a membership 
function (characteristic), which assigns to each object a degree of member‑
ship in the range from 0 to 1.

To deal with fuzzy sets is equivalent to dealing with a multivalent logic, 
called FL, where there are propositions p of type “
”
x
A
 is 
. In the example 
above, the fuzzy set defined is equivalent to the statement “x is tall” where 
xʼs height is measured.
FL does not satisfy the Aristotelian principles of Excluded Middle and 
Non-Contradiction. In FL, conjunctions can be defined as t-norms and 
disjunctions as t-conorms (Keikha, 2022). Other operations that can be 
defined are negations, implications, bi-implications, fuzzy order, etc.

To deal with IF–THEN type rules in FL, fuzzy inference systems (FIS) are 
defined, which combine the characteristics of FL with neural networks to 
obtain deductions with linguistic meanings. A schematic of this FIS is shown 
in Figure 15.3 (Jyh-Shing et al., 1997; Kaloop et al., 2021; Talpur et al., 2023).
The most popular FIS models are those of Mamdani, Sugeno, and 
Tsukamoto.

296  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
15.2.3  Ishikawa diagram
To construct the Ishikawa diagram, the following steps must be followed:
	
1.	Definition of the problem or effect.
	
2.	Elaboration of the graphic representation, where there is a central line 
that ends in a “head” where the problem or effect is written.
	
3.	The categories or factors that influence the problem are written. They 
extend obliquely to the center line.
	
4.	Part of the process is a proactive joint determination of the causes 
affecting the problem by the designated members. The team that 
comes together can use brainstorming to fill in the chart. The causes 
are represented by lines that point the factor which they affect.
	
5.	Once the diagram has been prepared, the information that it offers is 
analyzed, the main factors and causes are highlighted as well as the 
way to modify them to solve the problem.
	
6.	This analysis should end with the preparation of a plan to make the 
necessary improvements in the causes to solve the problem.
A generic Ishikawa Diagram can be seen in Figure 15.4. Note that the 
arrows represent causes that influence other causes.
15.3  FUZZY ISHIKAWA DIAGRAM
It is necessary to make it clear that as in the original diagram, in this case, 
it is necessary to follow an algorithm to obtain the results, and the same 
procedure must be followed, except that in this new conception, we achieve 
quantitative evaluations of each cause of the influence.

The steps to follow are those:
	
1.	Let

 be the factors that influence the problem. Each of them 
must be associated with a weight according to their influence on the 
problem; this must be discussed by the group. Let us say that to facili‑
tate the decision work, it is assigned a value from 1 to 10, where 1 
denotes “little influence” and 10 denotes “maximum influence.”
Let us denote by Wi, the collective results of weight assignment with 
=
…
i
l
1, 2,

Equation (15.1) is the normalization of the weights:
	
∑
ω =

2.	After determining the causes that influence each factor, we denote them 
by Cij, where =

i
l
1, 2, 
,  is the index of the factor on which the cause 
influences, while =
…
j
mi
1,2,
,
 is the order of the cause within the factor.
Once again, the value of the weights of each cause is determined by 
the factor on which it influences. Again, it is determined on a scale of 
1 to 10 and normalized.
Let us denote these weights as:
	
∑
ω =

such premise or cause at the time of the evaluation.

6.	In the case of having the cause of a cause, the same formulas and the 
same procedures are applied where Step 1 is applied to the cause that 
is an effect and Steps 2–4 are applied to the cause that causes the 
effect. The result of the state of the cause that is an effect is obtained 
from Eq. (15.4) and the weight is obtained from the assignment given 
by the decision-makers.
Remark 15.1
The previous algorithm is inspired by the calculus of the FIS, in the sense 
that the IF–THEN rules have an associated weight that is used in the aggre‑
gation of the results. The function 
(

 of Step 4 is Zadeh’s conjunction.

We can make the model less simple and define a sigmoid membership 
function 


0.1. A different membership function can 
be defined for each of the steps, according to the interest of the experts.
Remark 15.3
The above membership functions can be linguistically enriched by applying 
Zadehʼs fuzzy modifiers (Isik & Kaya, 2022; Jyh-Shing et al., 1997). For 
example, if µ( )
z  means “degree of influence,” then µ ( )
z
2
 means “a lot of 
influence,” while µ
( )
z
0.5
 means “more or less influence.”
Figure 15.5 contains the graphical representation of the previous 
algorithm.
Next, we will illustrate the proposed method with an example.
Example 15.1
Suppose we want to analyze the reasons for low educational quality in 
a specific generic Peruvian region.
The factors to consider are the following:
F1: Relevance: It is the factor that indicates the objective of educa‑
tion, and whom it serves. Ideally, it should respond to the needs 
of society. The results must be the formation of individuals who 
enrich society in every way, and who are capable to solve social 

A fuzzy Ishikawa diagram  299
problems, ethically and creatively. Citizens who are educated 
must be transforming positively for a better future.
F2: Effectiveness: Education must give positive results, for this it 
must have pedagogical programs, teaching methods, and faculty, 
among other aspects so that the results of education meet the 
objectives set.
F3: Pertinence: Education must be time for all members of society 
who need to study, it must be a boost to personal and collec‑
tive development, and it must be a support for every aspect of 
social life.
F4: Efficiency: Education needs material and financial resources. 
Only the necessary economic resources must be used to obtain 
the desired results, waste must be avoided because this is also 
counterproductive for society.
F5: Equity: All students must be important for education; there 
must be no difference between each one of them, except for their 
school performance. Education is important for everyone, not 
just for those economically dominant sectors. There should be no 
discrimination, based on ethnical origin, racial, gender, sexual 
preference, or economic level.
Figure 15.5  Flowchart of the proposed algorithm.

300  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
The second step is to determine and discuss the causes that influence 
each of the five factors above. For example, the equity factor is influ‑
enced by the culture of the country where the analysis is made, depend‑
ing on the degree of gender equity or racial equity existing in that 
society, which will be reflected in the causes.
Figure 15.6 shows the proposed Ishikawa Diagram.
Suppose that the weight of each factor in the posed problem is dis‑
cussed in the quality control group, and they are the following:
F1: Relevance: 4,
F2: Effectiveness: 8,
F3: Pertinence: 3,
F4: Efficiency: 9
F5: Equity: 10.
The normalized values are the following:
F1: Relevance: ω = 0.117647

,
F2: Effectiveness: ω = 0.235294

,
F3: Pertinence: ω = 0.088235
3
,
F4: Efficiency: ω = 0.264706
4
,
F5: Equity: ω = 0.294118
5
.
Next, the causes that influence each of the factors are determined, see 
Figure 15.7.
C11: The graduate students are socially recognized by their ethical 
behavior,
C12: The graduate students are socially recognized by their 
competencies,

tion in a generic Peruvian region.

C22: The educational senate is competent,
C23: Adequate curriculum,
C31: The teaching contributes to the student’s culture,
C32: The teaching contributes to the country’s culture,
C41: The educational institutions are economically sustainable,
C42: Educational institutions spend the budget rationally.
C51: Equal opportunities by ethnic origin,
C52: Equal opportunities by social classes,
C53: Equal opportunities by gender,
Table 15.1 summarizes the elements of Steps 2–4 of the proposed 
algorithm.
From Table 15.1, it can be seen that the fourth factor “Efficiency” 
is the one that most influences the low educational quality in the 
region, with a value of 0.6. The equity factor is the least influential 
with 0.22656. The other three are slightly bigger than 0.4, as well as 
the quality rating. That is why an economic analysis of efficiency in 
educational institutions should be done. Especially in the cause “the 
institutions are economically sustainable.”

302  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
15.4  CONCLUSIONS
This chapter was devoted to introducing a Fuzzy Ishikawa diagram, which 
is applied to measure the quality of education. The classic Ishikawa dia‑
gram is a simple and useful tool, which is why it is widely used in the indus‑
try for quality control; in addition, it has been extended to other fields, 
such as educational quality control. However, the classical model is not 
used to perform quantitative or qualitative measurements according to any 
measurement scale that allows comparing the progress made in solving the 
problem. The hybridization of FL with the Ishikawa diagram allows us 
to measure the current state of the problem, the model obtained is simple 
enough, it is feasible to automate, and can be linked to linguistic tools that 
are associated with FL. The use of this tool was illustrated with an example.

A novel integrated FCM/MCDM 
methodology for evaluating 
logistic performance index
N. Yapıcı Pehlivan
16.1  INTRODUCTION
Logistics is the function responsible for the flow of materials from sup‑
pliers into an organization, through operations within the organization, 
and then out to customers (Waters, 2003). There are five key elements of 
logistics: transport, warehousing, inventory, packaging, and information 
processing (Islam et al., 2013). Various definitions of logistics have been 
existed. According to Christopher (2011), logistics is the process of stra‑
tegically managing the procurement, movement and storage of materials, 
parts and finished inventory (and the related information flows) through 
the organization and its marketing channels in such a way that current and 
future profitability are maximized through the cost‑effective fulfillment of 
orders. The glossary of Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals 
(CSCMP, 2013) defined logistics as the process of planning, implementing, 
and controlling procedures for the efficient and effective transportation and 
storage of goods including services, and related information from the point 
of origin to the point of consumption for the purpose of conforming to 
customer requirements. Council of Logistics Management defined logistics 
as that part of the supply chain process that plans, implements, and con‑
trols the efficient, effective forward and reverse, flow and storage for goods, 
service, and related information, between the point of origin and the point 
of consumption to meet customer’s requirements. Logistics explained by 
Mangan et al. (2008) includes getting in the right way, the right product, in 
the right quantity and right quality, in the right place at the right time, for 
the right customer at the right cost.
The logistics performance index (LPI) is a multidimensional evaluation of 
the logistics performance of the countries on the basis of six indicators: cus‑
toms, infrastructure, quality of logistics services, timeliness, ease of arrang‑
ing shipments and tracking & tracing. It provides the most comprehensive 
international comparison tool to assess the trade and transport facilitation 
friendliness of countries (Ojala and Çelebi, 2015).
There are a limited number of studies using the LPI dataset that focus 
on the logistics performance of the countries. Behar and Manner (2008) 

306  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
investigated the relationships between bilateral exports and logistics by 
using the LPI. Hoekman and Nicita (2011) reviewed some indices of trade 
restrictiveness and trade facilitation and compared the trade effect of dif‑
ferent types of trade restrictions applied at the border with the effects of 
domestic policies influencing trade costs. In the study, a gravity regres‑
sion‑based analysis showed that tariffs and non‑tariff measures continue 
to be a significant source of trade restrictiveness for low‑income countries. 
Korinek and Sourdin (2011) examined the importance of the quality of 
trade logistics using gravity models on the LPI 2010 dataset to correlate 
with bilateral trade. Further, the different effects of trade logistics on low‑, 
middle‑ and higher‑income countries are analyzed. Lau (2011) discussed 
the development and usage of a green LPI to compare the performance 
among industries and countries through out China and Japan.
Güner and Coşkun (2012) measured the direction of the relationship 
between LPI and different economic and social indicators, by correlation 
analysis for 26 Organization for Economic Co‑operation and Development 
(OECD) countries to determine which indicator is more decisive. Felipe 
and Kumar (2012) carried out a gravity model to determine the relation‑
ship between bilateral trade flows and trade facilitation which is measured 
through the World Bank’s LPI. Martí et al. (2014a) analyzed the effect of 
LPI components on trade in developing economies using a gravity model. 
Martí et al. (2014b), using the LPI, applied the economic approach of grav‑
ity models to identify possible patterns in the performance analysis of trade 
flows in developing countries with a maritime border. Puertas et al. (2014) 
analyzed the importance of logistics performance in the exports of EU 
countries in the period of 2005–2010 to determine the possible progress on 
behalf of the Member States. The estimations of the gravity models using 
the two‑stage Heckman model for all 26 EU countries are obtained by using 
the LPI and its components. Markovits‑Somogyi and Bokor (2014) applied 
traditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and DEA combined with 
Analytic Hierarchy Process (DEA‑PC) to evaluate the logistics efficiency 
of 29 European countries. The results of DEA and DEA‑PC are compared 
and also evaluated in light of the “logistics quality and competence” index 
of the LPI. Ojala and Çelebi (2015) presented a qualitative assessment of 
the trade and transport policy environment to analyze the country’s logis‑
tics performance with regard to components of policy affecting trade and 
logistics regulations, procedures, and operations through a case study on 
Turkey. Çemberci et al. (2015) measured the moderating effect of the global 
competitiveness index on each dimension of LPI by means of the hierar‑
chical regression method. Çakır (2017) introduced a hybrid methodology 
which is a combination of criteria importance through intercritera correla‑
tion, simple additive weighting (SAW), and Peters’ fuzzy regression meth‑
ods for measuring the logistics performance of OECD countries using the 
devised model based on the data of LPI dataset 2014. Önsel Ekici et al. 

A novel integrated FCM/MCDM methodology  307
(2016) analyzed the relationship between the competitiveness indicators 
and LPI indicators using a methodology that combines artificial neural net‑
work and cumulative belief degrees to evaluate the logistics performance of 
Turkey. Mariano et al. (2017) proposed the DEA for building a composite 
index of low carbon logistic performance (LCLPI) and the window analysis 
and the Malmquist index are used to evaluate LCLPI over time. Marti et al. 
(2017) proposed a DEA approach to compute a synthetic index of overall 
logistics performance (DEA‑LPI) and benchmark the logistics performance 
of the countries with LPI. They also analyzed the potential differences 
observed when using different variables, namely income and geographical 
area. Roy et al. (2018) suggested a two‑stage methodology for the min‑
ing of the LPI 2014 dataset. At first, the LPI dataset is clustered into finite 
clusters using K‑means algorithm. Afterwards, the compatibility of mul‑
tivariate adaptive regression spline‑based regression is performed to cap‑
ture the complex non‑linear relationship between the variables. Öner and 
Öztayşi (2018) introduced a retailer segmentation approach based on fuzzy 
c‑means clustering (FCM) clustering and interval type 2 hesitant multi‑cri‑
teria decision‑making (MCDM). Chen et al. (2018) proposed an ordered 
K‑means clustering algorithm considering the preference degree between 
any two alternatives. To measure the closeness of alternatives different from 
the K‑means clustering algorithm, the relative net flow of PROMETHEE 
is applied concerning the human development indexes. Chai et al. (2019) 
is used partial correlation analysis and probit regression to form a credit 
rating indicator system composed of several indicators. Then, a technique 
for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) together with 
fuzzy c‑means is applied for scoring the credit ratings of small wholesale 
and retail enterprises in a regional commercial bank in China. Bai et al. 
(2014) introduced an ordered FCM clustering algorithm to search for the 
best c‑ordered partition and obtain acceptable clustering results based on 
the FCM in coordination with PROMETHEE concerning human develop‑
ment indexes.
LPI has been used to compare the countries, regions, and income groups 
and it is an effective measure that can assist countries in identifying chal‑
lenges and opportunities and improving their logistics performance. As 
far as we know, there is no study that combines the FCM algorithm and 
MCDM methods in the literature to evaluate the logistic performance of 
the countries via the LPI index. The unique contribution of this study is 
to assess and compare the logistic performance of countries, taking into 
account the LPI and its indicators, and the gross domestic product (GDP) 
of the countries in terms of both income and geographical area. The results 
obtained by FCM/MCDM methodology are important in terms of being 
compatible with LPI 2018 ranking results.
The remainder of this study begins with a detailed review of the LPI 
in Section 16.2. In Section 16.3, after explaining the FCM algorithm and 

308  Data-Driven Modelling with Fuzzy Sets
MCDM methods, an integrated methodology based on FCM and MCDM 
is proposed. In Section 16.4, a numerical example is carried out through the 
2018 LPI dataset to explain the proposed methodology. In Section 16.5, the 
ranking results of the proposed methodology are compared with the results 
obtained from other methods.
16.2  LOGISTIC PERFORMANCE INDEX
Logistics and transportation play an important role in international trade 
(Martí et al. 2014a). Logistics can be described as the process of planning, 
implementing, and managing the movement and storage of raw materials, 
work‑in‑progress inventory, finished goods, and the associated information 
from the point of origin to the point of consumption (Rushton and Walker, 
2007). The aim of logistics is to achieve high customer satisfaction through 
a high‑quality service with low or acceptable costs (Waters, 2003). Due to 
globalization and increased competitiveness, logistics become one of the 
most important factors for the development of international trade. Over 
the years, companies have signed many international trade agreements and 
established various organizations, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), the OECD, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
(Waters, 2003). According to the WTO, trade facilitation is defined as the 
simplification and harmonization of the international trade procedure for 
the collection, presentation, communications, and processing of data neces‑
sary for the transportation of goods in international trade. Evaluations of 
trade facilitation have been realized through the LPI (Martí et al. 2014a).
LPI is an effective measure to evaluate the countries’ logistics performance 
according to six indicators. It is used to compare the countries, regions, and 
income groups. The LPI has been released by the World Bank from 2007 
for every 2 years is an effective measure for evaluating the logistics per‑
formance of the countries (Yu and Hsiao, 2016). It is used to compare the 
countries, regions, and income groups and also can help countries identify 
challenges and opportunities and improve their logistics performance. The 
LPI was first published in a report named “connecting to compete” in 2007 
which was conducted on 150 countries and then repeated in 2010 and 2012 
for 155 countries, and in 2014, 2016, and 2018 for 160 countries. In the 
reports, the LPI has analyzed the countries based on a worldwide survey 
through six indicators explained as follows:
Customs: The efficiency of customs and border clearance in terms of 
speed, simplicity, and predictability of formalities.
Infrastructure: The quality of trade and transport infrastructure (e.g., 
ports, railroads, information technology).
Quality of Logistics Services: The competence and quality of logistics 
services (e.g. trucking, forwarding, and customs brokerage).

A novel integrated FCM/MCDM methodology  309
Timeliness: The timeliness of shipments in reaching their destination 
within scheduled or expected delivery times.
Ease of Arranging Shipments: The ease of arranging competitively priced 
shipments.
Tracking and Tracing: The ability to track and trace consignments.
The LPI is generated from these six indicators using Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) which is a statistical method to reduce the dimensionality 
of a dataset. The LPI is performed through a web‑based questionnaire con‑
sisting of international part and domestic parts. Each respondent evaluated 
qualitative data by using a 5‑point scale between 1 (worst) and 5 (best). 
The inputs for the PCA are considered as country scores obtained by taking 
a geometric average over all respondents’ data. The PCA is applied after 
normalizing the country scores. Finally, the LPI of each country which is 
the output of PCA is computed as weighted average scores. The weights of 
the indicators are considered as customs (0.4072), infrastructure (0.4130), 
international shipments (0.3961), logistics quality & competence (0.4166), 
tracking & tracing (0.4106), and timeliness (0.4056). According to the LPI 
scores, countries are divided into four categories: logistics‑unfriendly, par‑
tial performers, consistent performers, and logistics‑friendly (Arvis et al., 
2007, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018).
16.3  PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
The methodology consists of three stages which integrates the FCM algo‑
rithm and MCDM methods is introduced in this study. In the first stage, the 
dataset is clustered into a predetermined number of clusters. So, the member‑
ship values belonging to each cluster of the data and centroids of the clusters 
are determined. In the second stage, the ranking of the clusters is determined 
using the MCDM methods based on cluster centers (centroids) of the con‑
sidered criteria. In the third stage, the MCDM method is used to sort the 
countries assigned to the clusters according to the criteria considered.
MCDM methods have been used to solve real‑world problems that con‑
tain multiple and usually conflicting criteria considering decision‑makers’ 
judgments. A typical MCDM contains three steps: (i) determination of the 
criteria and alternatives, (ii) evaluations of each criteria and alternatives, 
and (iii) ranking of the alternatives. Selection of the MCDM methods is 
based on the nature of the problem, types of choices, measurement scales, 
dependency among the criteria, type of uncertainty, expectations, and 
qualitative/quantitative evaluations of decision makers (Hwang and Yoon, 
1981; Hatami‑Marbini et al., 2013).
In this section, the FCM algorithm is explained and then considered 
MCDM methods, i.e. TOPSIS, multi‑objective optimization by ratio analy‑
sis (MOORA), additive ratio assessment (ARAS), and SAW are briefly given.

Each element is assigned to a cluster with a membership value between 
0 and 1 by the FCM algorithm. The higher membership values of an ele‑
ment indicate the higher strength of the association between that element 
and a particular cluster. We assign an element to that cluster with which it 
has the highest membership value. In the FCM algorithm, two important 
information, the number of clusters (c) and the order of fuzziness (m), are 
determined by the user in advance. Since the selection of (c, m) and the 
initial values of the membership values/centroids provided by the user are 
subjective, these selections influence the quality of the optimal solution.
16.3.2  The technique for order preference 
by similarity to ideal solution
TOPSIS method which was developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) is based 
on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance 
from the positive ideal solution and the farthest from the negative‑ideal 
solution. The algorithm of the TOPSIS method is presented as follows:

16.4  NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
The LPI is an effective measure to evaluate the countries’ logistics perfor‑
mance. It is used to compare the countries, regions, and income groups and 
also can help countries identify challenges and opportunities and improve 
their logistics performance. In this study, dataset that include the overall 
LPI score and six indicators of the LPI as well as per capita GDP for all the 
countries, are considered. The GDP is an important measure of the growth 
of economies and at a country level, it is described as “consumption plus 
investment plus exports minus imports.”
In the proposed methodology, at the first stage, the LPI 2018 dataset is 
clustered into four income groups (high, upper middle, lower middle and 
low) on the basis of the overall LPI score and the per capita GDP of the 
countries by the FCM algorithm. In the FCM algorithm, the number of 
clusters (c) is taken as 4, and the order of fuzziness (m) is taken as 2. The 
membership value of each country to each particular cluster is determined. 
A country is assigned to a cluster for which it has the maximum member‑
ship value. For the Philippines, membership degrees belonging to Clusters 
1‑4 are 79.67%, 10.63%, 8.64% and 1.07%, respectively. Thus, the maxi‑
mum value of the membership degrees indicates the cluster to which the 
Philippines belong to Cluster 1. Turkey is assigned to Cluster 2, as the 
membership degrees belonging to Clusters 1‑4 are 17.04%, 76.44%, 4.65% 
and 1.84%, respectively. The membership degrees for Afghanistan belong‑
ing to Clusters 1–4 are 15.80%, 4.85%, 77.76% and 1.59%, respectively. 
So, Afghanistan is assigned to Cluster 3. In a similar manner, Germany is 
assigned to Cluster 4 because the membership degrees belonging to Clusters 
1‑ 4 are 3.54%, 8.18%, 2.44% and 85.84%, respectively,

A novel integrated FCM/MCDM methodology  315
In the second stage, the ranking of the clusters is determined by using con‑
sidered MCDM methods which are TOPSIS, SAW, ARAS and MOORA, 
based on cluster centers (centroids) of the overall LPI score and per capita 
GDP. For instance, Table 16.1 shows the positive ideal solution, negative 
ideal solution, and closeness coefficients computed by the TOPSIS method 
for each cluster. The ranking of clusters is obtained as Cluster 4, followed 
by Cluster 2, Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 and they are identified as high income, 
upper‑middle income, lower‑middle income, and low income. Same ranking 
results were also obtained using methods of SAW, ARAS, and MOORA.
According to the income group classification by FCM/MCDM method‑
ology, Turkey is assigned to Cluster 2, i.e. “upper middle income.” This 
is consistent with the income classification of the World Bank. Although 
the FCM/MCDM classification for many countries is compatible with the 
World Bank’s classification, some are not. In particular, there is high com‑
pliance in countries assigned to high‑income and low‑income groups, while 
lower‑middle and upper‑middle‑income countries are not well aligned with 
World Bank’s classification. For instance, some of the high‑income coun‑
tries by World Bank classification (e.g. Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, 
Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Korea Rep., Kuwait, 
Lithuania, Malta, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Slovak Rep., 
Slovenia and Taiwan) were identified as upper‑middle‑income group, some 
of them (e.g. Argentina, Bahamas, Latvia, and Uruguay) are assigned to 
lower‑middle‑income group and only one country, Trinidad and Tobago, is 
assigned to low‑income group according to the FCM/MCDM methodology.
In the third stage, the TOPSIS method is again used to determine the 
ranking of the countries within each of the income groups (high, upper mid‑
dle, lower middle, and low) according to the six indicators of the LPI. The 
ranking of the countries in those income groups by proposed FCM/MCDM 
and LPI 2018 constituted by the World Bank as well as MCDM methods on 
the basis of LPI’s six indicators (MCDM 1) are given in Tables 16.2–16.5. 
In these tables, ranking results obtained from the MCDM methods on the 
basis of LPI’s six indicators (MCDM 1) as well as the MCDM methods 
based on overall LPI score and per capita GDP (MCDM 2) are shown.
As shown in Tables 16.2–16.5, in terms of income groups constituted 
by the FCM algorithm, ranking results of the FCM/MCDM are generally

consistent with the LPI 2018, but not with MCDM1 and MCDM2. The 
Spearman correlation coefficients between FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018 
are 0.996, 0.994, 0.987, and 1.000 for high income, upper‑middle income, 
lower‑middle income, and low income, respectively. Table 16.6 shows the 
best and the worst 10 countries with respect to the ranking results of pro‑
posed FCM/MCDM, MCDM1, MCDM2, and World Bank’s LPI 2018.
Focusing on the best 10 countries which are also high‑income countries, 
with respect to the FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018 in Table 16.6, it is observed 
that there are three mismatches: Japan, Belgium, Austria are ranked as

A novel integrated FCM/MCDM methodology  321
Analyzing the ranking results of the FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018, income 
groups and geographical regions have an impact on the logistic perfor‑
mance of the countries. According to the World Banks’s classification, 
there are four income groups (high, upper middle, lower middle, and low) 
and seven geographical regions: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central 
Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, North 
America, South Asia, and Sub‑Saharan Africa. To investigate these situa‑
tions, one‑way analysis of variance for nonparametric data, Kruskal–Wallis 
H test, is used because of non‑normality of the LPI 2018 dataset. The null 
hypothesis used for this test is that the average performance is independent 
from income or geographical region. A summary of Kruskal–Wallis H test 
for income and geographical region is given in Table 16.7.
As shown in Table 16.7, the null hypothesis is rejected at a 5% significance 
level since the p‑value <0.001 for the FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018. It means 
that at least the logistic performance in some group of the countries is sig‑
nificantly different from other groups. Dunn’s post hoc tests are carried out 
on each pair of income groups and geographical regions to determine which

groups are different from the others. When performing multiple tests, SPSS 
makes an adjustment to the p‑value. The Bonferroni adjustment is to multi‑
ply each Dunn’s p‑value by the total number of tests being carried out. The 
pairwise comparisons that show the results of the Dunn‑Bonferroni tests on 
six pairs of income groups and 21 pairs of geographical regions are given in 
Tables 16.8 and 16.9, respectively.
In Table  16.8, test statistics, significance (Sig.), and adjusted signifi‑
cance (Adj. Sig.) are shown. The Adj. Sig column makes the adjustments 
for multiple testing using the Bonferroni error correction. The p‑value for 
the test comparing the income groups of the high‑upper middle (p  <0.001), 
high‑lower middle (p  <0.001), high‑low (p   <0.001), and upper middle‑low 
(p = 0.001 < 0.05) are significant (marked with *) for both the FCM/MCDM 
and LPI 2018. There is no evidence of a difference between the other pairs 
of income groups.
It is seen that from Table 16.9, the p‑value for the test comparing the geo‑
graphical regions of the Europe & Central Asia–Latin America & Caribbean 
(p = 0.005 < 0.05 for FCM/MCDM and p = 0.006 < 0.05 for LPI 2018  ), 
Europe & Central Asia–South Asia (p = 0.022 < 0.05 for FCM/MCDM and 
p = 0.020 < 0.05 for LPI 2018), Europe & Central Asia–Sub‑Saharan Africa (p  
<0.001), and East Asia & Pacific–Sub‑Saharan Africa (p  <0.001) are signifi‑
cant (marked with *) for FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018. There is no evidence 
of a difference between the other pairs of geographical regions. Pairwise

16.5  CONCLUSION
In this study, we presented an integrated methodology based on the FCM 
algorithm and MCDM methods to rank the countries in terms of logistic 
performance through the LPI 2018 dataset. Although the FCM algorithm 
and MCDM methods have been widely used in various fields, combin‑
ing FCM with MCDM methods can provide effective tools for logistic 
professionals.
It is found that ranking results obtained by the proposed methodology 
are very similar to given in the LPI 2018 report. Since the Spearman cor‑
relation coefficients between LPI 2018 and FCM/MCDM, MCDM1, and 
MCDM2 are computed as 0.997, 0.971, and 0.890, respectively. This situ‑
ation shows that the ranking results of FCM/MCDM is compatible with 
ranking results of the LPI 2018 report.
This study shows that there are striking differences between the best and 
the worst countries in ranking according to the FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018 
report. As seen from the LPI reports in 2018 and earlier, the logistic perfor‑
mances of the countries are heavily dependent on income and geographical 
area. Top 10 countries are generally high‑income countries from the year 
2007 which is the beginning of the LPI. Most of these are European coun‑
tries such as Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, Denmark, 
Finland, and the United Kingdom and they are dominant in logistics globally 
and regionally. China, Thailand, and South Africa among the upper‑mid‑
dle‑income countries in both classifications of the FCM/MCDM and World 
Bank perform best. In addition, countries such as India, Indonesia, and 
Vietnam which take place in the lower‑middle‑income according to the 
Figure 16.1  Pairwise comparisons of (a) income groups and (b) geographical regions.

A novel integrated FCM/MCDM methodology  325
World Bank’s classification and take place in the upper‑middle‑income 
countries according to the FCM/MCDM classification, stand out as the 
best performing countries.
Similarly, countries with low income and lower‑middle income, espe‑
cially the Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Haiti, Libya, Eritrea, Sierra 
Leone, Niger, Burundi, and Angola located in Africa, and Afghanistan 
located in Asia, take the bottom positions according to the LPI 2018 report 
and proposed methodology. These countries have faced either wars con‑
flicts, natural disasters, poverty, or political unrest.
Kruskal–Wallis H test is used because of non‑normality of LPI2018 data‑
set to analyze the ranking results of the FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018 with 
respect to income groups and geographical regions. It is determined that 
at least the logistic performance in some groups of the countries is signifi‑
cantly different from other groups for both FCM/MCDM and LPI 2018. 
Dunn’s post hoc tests are performed on each pair of income groups and geo‑
graphical regions making Bonferonni adjustment. There are significant dif‑
ferences between income groups of high‑upper middle, high‑lower middle, 
high‑low, and upper middle‑low. There are differences between geographi‑
cal regions of Europe & Central Asia–Latin America & Caribbean, Europe 
& Central Asia–South Asia, Europe & Central Asia–Sub‑Saharan Africa, 
East Asia & Pacific–Sub‑Saharan Africa.
This study can help policy‑makers of countries that are at the bottom 
in the LPI ranking, to demonstrate that they have to improve their cus‑
toms, infrastructures, quality of logistics services, timeliness and ease 
of arranging shipments and tracking & tracing. For future studies, an 
ordered K‑means clustering algorithm and ordered FCM can be performed 
to cluster a great number of data on logistics much faster. In addition, 
the use of other MCDM methods (e.g. ELECTRE, COPRAS, and GRA) 
can be attempted for more practical applications under crisp and fuzzy 
environment.
