Rome For Dummies, 1st Edition

Introduction
R
ome, the Eternal City, the capital of the ancient Roman Empire and
of the modern Italian state, is a city with many faces and myriad
charms. Its history is epic — the city that vanquished Carthage and was
itself sacked by barbarians — and is written in its monuments and ruins.
Rome is also one of the most beautiful cities in the world, especially since
the great refurbishing of its many monuments and revamping of its muse-
ums and attractions for the 2000 Papal Jubilee. More tourist friendly than
ever, Rome can be bewildering, however, with its noise and traffic and 
its meandering streets. As an increasing number of people speak some
English, the language barrier has slowly been receding, but don’t expect
everyone to understand English. Knowing a few key words and phrases in
Italian will take you far; we list some of them throughout this book and
especially in Chapter 17 and Appendix B.) You’ll find Romans warm and
welcoming, and ready to help ease you into la dolce vita.
About This Book
Whether you’re a first-timer or making a repeat visit to see sights you
missed the first go-round, Rome For Dummies is designed to give you all
the information you need to help you make savvy, informed decisions
about your trip, while also guiding you to the discovery of known and
lesser-known facets of this exciting city.
You’ll be able to use this guide as a reference book to look up exactly
what you need at the time you need it. No need to read the whole thing
from cover to cover — you can just dive in at any point. No need, either,
to remember what you read: There are plenty of easy-to-find flags for
quickly locating the bit of info you want.
Some people spend more time planning their trip than they do taking it.
We know your time is valuable, so here, we happily do the work for you
to help ease you into a memorable Roman holiday. Unlike some travel
guides that read more like a phone book or directory, listing everything
and anything, this book cuts to the chase. We’ve done the legwork for
you, offering our expertise and not-so-humble opinions to help you 
make the right choices for your trip.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. We therefore suggest that
you write or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans.
The authors, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the
experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,

however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite
targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
The structure of this book is nonlinear: You can open it at any point and
delve into the subject at hand. We use icons to guide you toward partic-
ular kinds of tips and advice (see “Icons Used in This Book,” later in this
introduction).
We include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions, and for each we
give you our frank evaluation. We divide the hotels into two categories:
our personal favorites and those that don’t quite make our preferred 
list but still get our hearty seal of approval. Don’t be shy about consider-
ing these “runner-up” hotels if you’re unable to get a room at one of our
favorites, or if your preferences differ from ours — they’re still excellent
choices with above-average amenities and services.
We use this series of abbreviations for commonly used credit cards in
our hotel and restaurant reviews:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
Note that Discover is not listed. The Discover Card is unknown in Italy,
so carrying one or more of the big three — American Express, Visa, or
MasterCard — is a good idea.
We also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. We use 
a system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a 
hotel (the price refers to a double-occupancy room) or a full meal at 
a restaurant — including a pasta or appetizer, a secondo (main course

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

or entree), a side dish, and a dessert (but no beverages). Note that within
the restaurant listing info, we give you the price range of just the main
courses, referred to as secondi. See Chapter 9 for a detailed chart telling
you exactly what to expect in each hotel category. Here is a table to deci-
pher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
120€ ($156) or less
35€ ($46) or less
$$
121€–230€ ($157–$299)
36€–50€ ($47–$65)
$$$
231€–350€ ($300–$455)
51€–65€ ($66–$85)
$$$$
351€ ($456) and up
66€ ($86) and up
Prices are given in euros, with the U.S. dollar conversion; the exchange
rate used is 1€ = $1.30. Although we give you definite prices, establish-
ments sometimes change prices without notice. Also, there have been
cases in which a price went down but because of exchange fluctuations,
the cost went up. (See the “Follow the bouncing euro” sidebar for more
on euro exchange rates.)
Another thing you’ll find attached to each listing is contact information.
Web sites are listed whenever possible. As for telephone numbers, don’t
be surprised if you see % 06-93021877 just near % 06-290831. The
number of digits in Italian phone numbers is not standardized as it is 
in the United States. Area codes can have two, three, or four digits; the
rest of the number could have as few as four or as many as eight digits.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made some assumptions about you and what your needs may be
as a traveler. Here’s what we assume about you:
Introduction 3
Follow the bouncing euro
Only a few years ago, the euro was worth about 90¢. Now it has bounced back
strongly, and it costs around $1.30 to buy a euro. That’s a 40-cent swing, which can
make a huge difference. The 100€-per-night hotel that seemed like a bargain at $90 a
couple years ago now costs $130 (if you can still find it; for more about price changes
and increases, see Chapter 4). Obviously, keeping an eye on the euro while you’re
planning for your trip will be helpful.

 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Rome and wants expert advice when you finally do get a
chance to enjoy the Eternal City.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Rome and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information 
available about Rome or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or 
attraction available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that
focuses on the places that will give you the best or most unique
experience in Rome.
If you fit any of this criteria, Rome For Dummies gives you the informa-
tion you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
The book has six parts plus two appendixes. Each can be read independ-
ently if you want to zero in on a particular area or issue.
Part I: Introducing Rome
This is where you find out more in-depth information about Rome. It
begins with our rundown of the best of Rome in Chapter 1; continues 
in Chapter 2 with Rome’s history, culture, people, architecture, and cui-
sine; and ends in Chapter 3 with climatic information and a calendar of
special events.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome
Here, we guide you through trip planning: budgeting (Chapter 4), decid-
ing on escorted and package tours, and choosing whether you want to
make the travel arrangements yourself or work through an agent (Chap-
ter 5). We include Web sites throughout the section (and, indeed, the
whole book), because that’s where you often can find the best deals. 
We also address the special concerns of disabled travelers, families, 
seniors, and gays and lesbians (Chapter 6). Finally, we give you tips on
all the other necessary details — from getting your passport to thinking
about your health (Chapter 7).
Part III: Settling into Rome
Rome may be eternal, but it’s far from dead. Here, we give you all the
logistic info on how to get around this bustling city and where to find
additional information (Chapter 8), as well as the lowdown on hotels
(Chapter 9) and restaurants (Chapter 10).

Part IV: Exploring Rome
This section provides our selection of what are for us the best features
and attractions of Rome (Chapter 11), its best shops and markets (Chap-
ter 12), and a choice of guided tours and itineraries through its maze 
of ancient and modern treasures (Chapter 13). We also include side 
trips off the beaten track to great destinations on the outskirts of Rome
(Chapter 14).
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Rome’s Nightlife
Here is where we give you tips on where to find the entertainment that
best suits your mood, from classical concerts and opera (Chapter 15) 
to bars, pubs, and discos (Chapter 16).
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens allows us to squeeze in some extra stuff — Italian
expressions worth knowing (Chapter 17), our favorite Italian artists
(Chapter 18), and ideas for special souvenirs (Chapter 19) — that we
believe will complement your vacation and make your trip complete.
In the back of this book, we’ve included two appendixes. The first —
your Quick Concierge — contains lots of handy information you may
need when traveling in Rome, like phone numbers and addresses of
emergency personnel or area hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local
newspapers and magazines, protocols for sending mail or finding taxis,
and more. Check out this appendix when searching for answers to lots 
of little questions that may come up as you travel. You can find the
Quick Concierge easily because it’s printed on yellow paper.
Appendix B contains a glossary of Italian words that will earn you warm
appreciation from the Italians.
Icons Used in This Book
We use icons throughout this book as signposts and flags for facts and
information of a particular nature or interest. Following are the six types
of icons we use:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
Best of the Best highlights the best Rome has to offer in all categories:
hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Introduction 5

Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids. When the icon is used in conjunction with a restaurant listing,
it means that high chairs and mezza porzione (half portions) are avail-
able, and we spell out in the description what other special attention
they provide. When we use the icon with a hotel listing, it means that the
hotel can add a crib or an extra bed or two to your room (or the hotel
has triples and quads available). It also means that the hotel might offer
babysitting and/or amenities suitable for children, such as a garden,
swimming pool, or play area.
The Plan Ahead icon draws your attention to details or plans that you
should take care of before you leave home.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Where to Go from Here
Now you can dig in wherever you want. Chapter 1 highlights the best of
Rome, from museums to hotels to intangibles (experiences you might
not want to miss). If you already have an itinerary in mind, you can jump
ahead to the ins and outs of finding a flight and making a budget; or you
can browse through sights and attractions you may want to visit. And if
you’ve already visited Rome once or a score of times, you’re sure to find
something here you haven’t seen before.

Best of Rome
In This Chapter
 From picture galleries to ruins
 From frescoes to gelato
 From smart dining to picnic fare
 From hotels to nightclubs
P
eople visit Rome for all sorts of reasons. Art lovers flock to its great
museums; the faithful make pilgrimages to St. Peter’s Basilica and
the Vatican; and others come to soak up Italy’s culture and atmosphere
(or just the sun). In Rome For Dummies, we give you our opinions on the
best Rome has to offer. In this chapter, we list our very favorites. The
places in this chapter are marked with the Best of the Best icon through-
out the rest of this book.
The Best Museums
Rome boasts numerous museums, some vast and famous, others small
and catering to specialized audiences. Here is our short list of the not-to-
be-missed museums that contain internationally renowned masterpieces
and other mind-boggling beauties: 
 The Musei Vaticani (Vatican Museums) top our list, for the monu-
mental size of their collections and amazing number of master-
pieces. They include dozens of rooms dedicated to Renaissance
painting and sculpture, as well as a fantastic Egyptian section, an
impressive ancient Roman collection, and ethnological art from all
over the world. The museums are also home to the Sistine Chapel
(mentioned in the next section). See Chapter 11.
 The Galleria Borghese (Borghese Gallery) isn’t very big, but it is a
triumph of Renaissance beauty. Caravaggio paintings and Bernini
sculptures are only a few of its many treasures. See Chapter 11.

 The Palazzo Massimo alle Terme (Massimo Palace by the Terme)
is a huge museum completely dedicated to Ancient Roman art. It
contains hundreds of artifacts that have been found during the
excavation of archaeological sites in Rome and surrounding areas,
including a superb collection of sculptures and some breathtak-
ingly beautiful Roman frescoes. See Chapter 11.
 The Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia (National Etruscan
Museum of Villa Giulia) holds a wonderful collection completely
dedicated to the Etruscans, the mysterious predecessors of the
Romans. This is a unique treasure trove of Etruscan artifacts and
jewelry. See Chapter 11.
 The Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali (National Museum
of Musical Instruments) has recently reopened its doors after a
major reorganization. Its splendid collection of rare and marvelous
instruments is a wonderful surprise for anyone, but it especially
delights music lovers. See Chapter 11.
The Best Churches
Among Rome’s hundreds of churches, we considered not only the archi-
tecture of the church itself and the importance of the artwork inside, 
but also the individual charm and personality of each. Here are our top
picks:
 Basilica di San Pietro (St. Peter’s Basilica) in Rome is the most
famous church in a city filled with magnificent churches. Its majes-
tic colonnade and soaring dome are a symbol of Rome as well as of
the Catholic Church; treasures inside include Michelangelo’s Pietà.
See Chapter 11.
 Santa Maria sopra Minerva is the only Gothic church in Rome and
is filled with artistic delights such as Michelangelo’s sculpture
Cristo Portacroce. See Chapter 11.
 The Cappella Sistina (Sistine Chapel) contains the most famous
artwork in all of Italy, and after the Mona Lisa, the ceiling of the
chapel is probably the most famous single piece of art in the world.
Decorated with Michelangelo’s frescoes, it is accessible from the
Vatican Museums. Don’t forget your binoculars. See Chapter 11.
 The little chapel of the Basilica di Santa Prassede (St. Prassede
Basilica) will take your breath away. It is one of the oldest churches
in Rome and completely covered with gilded mosaics. See Chap-
ter 11.
 The church of Santa Maria in Trastevere is a splendid example of
Medieval and Byzantine art, which is rare in Rome after the general
Baroque overhaul. It is also an excellent excuse to visit Trastevere,
a delightful neighborhood. See Chapter 11.

The Best Ruins
Considering that Rome is the site of the world’s largest collection of
ancient Roman archaeological remains, deciding which places to visit
can be a trying affair. Here’s a list of our favorite and most atmospheric
sites:
 The majestic and austere Colosseo (Colosseum), where the Romans
watched “sports” (as in fights to the death) and chariot races, is
Rome’s most famous ruin and an impressive work of architecture.
See Chapter 11.
 The Foro Romano (Roman Forum) and the Palatino (Palatine Hill),
containing the remains of temples, public buildings, villas, and tri-
umphal arches, will take you back in time. They are particularly
evocative on romantic Roman nights. See Chapter 11.
 The Appia Antica (Appian Way), the first road built by the ancient
Romans, has been transformed into an archaeological park that
you can visit on foot or by bicycle. Along the way are the remains
of tombs and villas that make the trip well worth the exercise. See
Chapter 11.
 The Terme di Caracalla (Caracalla Baths) were among the largest
in Rome and are still an impressive sight. They also become the site
for opera performances during the Roman summers. See Chapters
11 and 15.
 The Villa Adriana near Tivoli, outside Rome, is more than just a
villa. It is a huge complex of buildings, gardens, reflecting pools,
and theaters built by the Emperor Hadrian in the second century
A.D. In the mountains above Rome where Hadrian and a few hun-
dred friends could get away from it all, the villa remains an atmos-
pheric retreat. See Chapter 14.
The Best Hotels
We picked our favorite luxury hotels as well as our preferred moderately
priced and inexpensive accommodations. For good measure, we’ve also
thrown in a few places that have a particularly special atmosphere or
are a good deal for families:
 Presidents and stars stay at the Hotel de Russie, positively one of
the most elegant and classiest hotels in the world. Contemporary
design and exquisite good taste are coupled with excellent service
and antique beauty. See Chapter 9.
 The Hotel Arenula is the best of the less-expensive hotels in Rome
for service, quality of the rooms’ furnishings, and location. See
Chapter 9.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Rome 11

 The Albergo Santa Chiara is one of the oldest hotels in Rome and
our favorite. The beauty of the palace and the quality of the service
make it a great value. See Chapter 9.
 If you have your children with you, the best hotel for you might be
the Hotel Britannia, where children under 10 stay for free in their
parents’ room and where triples are available. See Chapter 9.
 If you want to fully immerse yourself in historical Rome, check in at
the Hotel Celio, where frescoed walls and mosaic floors create a
truly special atmosphere. See Chapter 9.
The Best Restaurants
Here is a short list of our favorite restaurants in Rome. We love many
more than what we describe here, and you’ll find all those we left behind
in Chapter 10:
 For fantastic views over the Eternal City, with wonderful food to
match, try La Pergola. This elegant restaurant will be one of your
most romantic experiences in Rome. See Chapter 10.
 For a truly Roman outing — vetted by Alessandra, a Rome native —
nothing can beat Checchino dal 1887, a historical restaurant in
Monte Testaccio. See Chapter 10.
 For the best enoteca (restaurant winery) in town, head to Enoteca
Capranica. Not only will you love the food, the wine, and the atmos-
phere, but you’ll also get to enter one of the most charming Roman
palaces in the historical center. See Chapter 10.
 If you’re a gourmet, you should not miss Il Convivio Troiani, the
best restaurant in Rome. The dining rooms are extremely welcom-
ing and pleasant, and the food is a delight. See Chapter 10.
 If you have only one night in Rome, make your reservations at La
Casina Valadier; this La Dolce Vita hangout has finally reopened its
doors after a lengthy restoration and offers great food, a great loca-
tion, and sweeping views. See Chapter 10.
The Best Buys in Rome
Shopping in Rome is great fun and a perfect excuse to stroll the
labyrinthine streets. You can also find some unique treasures, including
the following souvenirs:
 Select a pair of socks fit for a cardinal — or any other religious
item you might think of — from one of the shops in the center of
Rome. These historical vendors showcase a variety of items from
apparel to artwork. See Chapter 12.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
12

 Give yourself the pleasure of a handmade piece of gold jewelry.
The ancient tradition of goldsmiths is well alive in Rome, and you’ll
find craftspeople working in a variety of styles, from reproductions
of ancient techniques to contemporary design. See Chapter 12.
 An antique print makes a wonderful gift — for yourself or a loved
one. This traditional Roman craft has been maintained since the
Renaissance. See Chapter 12.
 Get a picture of the pope from the huge collection at the Vatican
gift shop. See Chapter 11.
 Take your pick of fashion accessories — scarves, leather gloves,
handbags, wallets, watches, sunglasses — from the many local
designers in Rome. See Chapter 12.
The Best Daytime and Nighttime Outings
In our opinion, you shouldn’t leave Rome before having taken part in at
least a few of the following adventures:
 Take a hot-air balloon ride over the city. From its base in Villa
Borghese, the anchored balloon — the largest in the world — 
soars high into the sky, affording breathtaking views. See Chap-
ter 11.
 Go for a river cruise along the Tiber. The Compagnia di Navigazione
Ponte San Angelo organizes both romantic dinner cruises and day
excursions, including a great one to Ostia Antica. See Chapter 11.
 Book tickets for an opera performance at the Terme di Caracalla
(Caracalla Baths), the summer location of the Teatro dell’Opera.
See Chapter 15.
 Listen to a concert or watch a dance performance at the Parco
della Musica, the recently opened state-of-the-art performing-arts
center in Rome. See Chapter 15.
 Go for a drink at one of the historical cafes in Rome, the best being
the Caffè Greco in Via Condotti, near the Spanish Steps. It still has
its original 19th-century furnishings and decoration. See Chapter 16.

U
nder the Roman Empire, all roads really did lead to Rome, which
was the cosmopolitan heart of the Roman civilization. In spite of
some passionate attempts by Milan to steal her role, Rome still is the
cosmopolitan heart of the Italian civilization and culture. For thousands
of years, artists have come to Rome to work; visitors have come to Rome
to see the grandiose monuments; and since the city was made the seat
of the Holy See (the official papal seat), pilgrims have come to Rome for
spiritual enlightenment.
Artists and scholars were drawn to the city during the Renaissance, and
their contributions exist today in Rome’s churches, buildings, and public
squares. In the 19th century, young aristocrats from all over Europe and
the United States flocked here to absorb the classical world and admire
Renaissance art in that rite of passage that was the Grand Tour (the
months-long European tour enjoyed by the rich and satirized by Mark
Twain in The Innocents Abroad). Rome was maybe the single most 
important stop then, and it remains so today.
Here we try to draw a quick picture of the most striking cultural features
of this historically and culturally rich city.
History 101: The Main Events
As legend has it, Rome was founded by Romolo, one of two semigod
twins (the other one was Remo) fathered by Mars on the daughter of a
local king, Rea Silvia. After a close escape from death — they were saved
by a wolf who nursed them — the twins grew up and set about establish-
ing a new town. After a dispute, Romolo took over and marked on the
ground the limits of his new town. The date was April 21, 753 B.C. The
city grew to be a beacon of civilization, absorbing and borrowing any

good features from all other cultures it encountered (or conquered), and
creating a set of rules, principles, and laws that are still the bedrock of
modern Western values and institutions.
Rome started as a collection of shepherds’ huts, a small town populated
by the local Italic tribe. These people were descended from the Villanova
tribes, which had settled in the region of Rome around 1,000 B.C. on the
Palatino (Palatine Hill). The town was deeply influenced by the Etruscans,
a people famed for their seafaring, gold and metal work, and trading. The
Etruscans probably came from Asia Minor, but they established them-
selves in Tuscany and then expanded southward. They gave Rome its
name, drained the swamps, built sewers, and introduced writing. At that
time, Rome had kings, and the chasing out of the last king coincided
with the loss of influence by the Etruscans. Weakened by their struggles
with the Greeks, who were colonizing southern Italy, the Etruscans lost
their power over Rome near the beginning of the fifth century B.C.
The Roman Republic was founded in 509 B.C., when the last of Rome’s
kings was overthrown. The republic was headed by two consuls and the
senate, all controlled by the upper or patrician (aristocratic) class. The
plebeians (the working class) later obtained their own council and were
represented by tribunes. It took hundreds of years for Rome to gain con-
trol over the Italian peninsula; in the meantime, it suffered many reverses,
including the destruction of the city by the Gauls in 390 B.C.
Gradually, Roman military supremacy was established. The Romans have
been called the “Prussians of the ancient world” for their militarism.
They first showed their might in decades of bloody war against the city
of Carthage, whose empire spread across North Africa and into Spain.
Known as the Punic Wars, these conflicts began in 264 B.C. It took the
Carthagian general Hannibal six months to make his famous march over
the Alps to attack the Romans from behind in 218 B.C., which marked the
start of the Second Punic War. Hannibal’s army inflicted crushing defeats
on the Roman armies, but eventually, the Punic Wars ended with the
Romans erasing Carthage from the map in 146 B.C. The door was then
open for Rome to spread its influence across the Mediterranean. It ruled
its provinces through governors and allowed subject countries to retain
local government and customs — though betrayal of Rome was brutally
avenged. The republic became fantastically rich, and Hellenic and
Eastern art, wealth, and cultural influences flowed into Rome. Recent
archaeological finds have shown a Roman presence as far away as the
borders of China.
The end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire
arrived largely through the antagonism of two great generals, Pompey
and Julius Caesar. Caesar became a tyrant after his defeat of Pompey.
Following Caesar’s murder on the Ides of March (March 15) in 44 B.C., civil
war ensued and was won by Caesar’s grandnephew and adopted son,
Octavian, who became the first emperor, Caesar Augustus. His regime
turned Rome into a glowing marble city the likes of which the world had
never seen, but he was followed by a string of mostly debauched and even

insane rulers: Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. Thanks to Robert
Graves’s historical novel I, Claudius (and the subsequent television minis-
eries based on the book), Claudius is popularly considered a partial
exception (even though his third wife, Nero’s mother, was also his niece,
and Claudius also had 40 senators put to death during his reign — he
was by no means a model of enlightened statesmanship). And then 
there was Nero, whose very name is a synonym for cruelty — he had 
his own mother put to death in A.D. 59. Rome also famously burned in
A.D. 64, under Nero’s reign (though not, perhaps, by his own hand).
The last hurrah, so to speak, for the Roman Empire came in the second
century, when it enjoyed a string of “good” emperors who brought order,
stable succession, and civility — instead of madness and corruption —
to the state. They were Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and
the philosopher–emperor Marcus Aurelius. With the ascension of
Marcus’s 19-year-old son Commodus (the villain of the hugely popular
but fictionalized film Gladiator), the empire was headed once again for
trouble. The corrupt and arrogant Commodus even had the senate 
recognize him as divine. With his assassination in A.D. 192, the empire
plunged once more into chaos.
At its height, the empire extended from the Caspian Sea to Scotland.
However, a chaotic period of war, plague, barbarian invasions, and infla-
tion spelled the beginning of the bitter end. When Emperor Constantine
converted to Christianity and founded Constantinople in A.D. 330, Rome’s
wealth shifted east. The western empire began to crumble under barbar-
ian pressure: The Goths sacked Rome in A.D. 410; the Huns came next
under Attila; and they were followed by the Vandals of North Africa. In
A.D. 476, the German chief Odoacer deposed the western Roman emperor,
in effect signaling the end of the once-invincible Roman Empire.
Almost 80 years passed before Rome was reconquered by the Byzantines
of the Roman Oriental Empire at the end of a long and destructive war
against the Goths. The city had suffered terrible destruction, and its
population had dwindled from over 2 million at the height of the Roman
Empire to about 35,000. After the church’s right to have a political state
was recognized and the Vatican state was established under the aegis of
the Franks, Rome settled back into being a small provincial town. The
French king Charlemagne had the pope crown him emperor in A.D. 800,
hoping to revive the western Roman Empire. He instead ended up found-
ing the Holy Roman Empire.
This historical oddity profoundly affected Roman politics during the
Middle Ages and Renaissance. The German emperor was elected by 
the German princes, but only the pope could crown him Holy Roman
Emperor. For the next 1,000 years, the pope became a key element in the
struggle for power among the Holy Roman Emperor (who was German),
Spain, and France (aspiring to the imperial crown). In spite of the trou-
bles that such a system brought to Rome — the city was under siege
between 1081 and 1084, before being won by the Normans — the papacy
grew stronger and richer, allowing it to become a leading force in Italy.

The popes, usually coming from the leading families in Rome, attracted
the best artists from all over Italy and Europe to decorate the city’s ever-
increasing number of religious and secular buildings. They would give
great influence to the artistic side of the Renaissance — the rediscovery
of classical learning and culture — as they sought to make their city and
its churches more and more splendid with works of art and architectural
masterpieces.
But in many ways, Rome was very backward. Unfortunately, the popes
were not very interested in commerce, and they imposed a reactionary
and stultifying rule that killed the economy and stopped the city’s devel-
opment, making them quite unpopular. This state of affairs lasted for
hundreds of years. Rome was also caught up in international politics and
war, as well as in the struggle for power in Europe between the Germans
and the French. The German troops of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles
V sacked the holy city on May 6, 1527, one of Rome’s darkest days. Peace
was restored in 1529, and the popes kept their control over the city until
the 19th century.
When the Risorgimento (resurgence) movement, which envisioned a uni-
fied Italy, started developing, Rome was the designated capital for the uni-
fied country, and local patriots started working toward that aim. In 1848,
when revolution swept Europe, Romans seemed to have a somewhat sym-
pathetic ruler in Pius IX, who granted many concessions. However, after
a democratic republic was declared the following year, Pius fled, and
entreated France, Austria, Spain, and the Kingdom of Naples to help him
regain his temporal power. Romans, obviously, could not defeat several
great empires at once, and papal rule was restored.
In fact, Rome was the last piece of the Italian puzzle to fall to the nation-
alist movement, because the pope continued to receive help from the
French. In 1870, almost ten years after the unification of the rest of Italy,
Rome was finally wrested from papal–French control and made into the
capital of the Italian Kingdom — the parliamentary monarchy of the
Savoy house — thus completing the unification.
After World War I, discontent and economic depression helped Mussolini
rise to power in Rome and in the rest of the country. One of his first
actions was to reach an agreement with the Vatican, the issue of whose
political role had continued to divide the people of Rome ever since the

unification of Italy in 1870. With the Lateran Pacts of 1929, the pope
agreed to have a much reduced state, and Rome relinquished the territory
of the Vatican while recognizing the pope’s authority on church ground.
Mussolini’s imperialist adventures abroad were matched by repression 
at home, and his alliance with the Nazis was disastrous. Italians turned
against him in 1943, and his puppet government was overthrown. Under
the king’s rule, Italy continued in World War II on the Allied side while 
suffering under German occupation. Rome was bombed repeatedly dur-
ing the German occupation and suffered much destruction. It was finally
liberated on June 4, 1944, by the Allies — only two days before D-day.
After the war, Rome voted against the monarchy and was established as
the capital of the new Italian republic. Economic recovery was slow, but
Rome emerged from the process as a thriving modern city and seat of
the Italian government on the one hand, and an ancient archaeological
site badly in need of preservation on the other. This contrast set up the
tension between modernization and preservation of the city’s unique
historical endowment that persists to this day. (Rome has been building
its subway system for over a century but still has only two lines because
of the innumerable archaeological treasures hidden underground.)
Traffic — a Roman problem since antiquity — continues to top the list 
of local priorities, together with the management of the massive influxes
of illegal immigrants and refugees that has been a factor since the 1990s.
Architecture: From Ruins to Rococo
Rome offers an almost complete compendium of architectural styles —
Ancient Roman, Romanesque, medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, baroque,
rococo, neoclassical, modern, and so on. Roman architecture was deeply
influenced by Greek culture, as can be seen in column-capital styles
around the city:
 The Doric style is most easily spotted in the simple rectilinear 
capitals at the tops of columns.
 The Ionic capital is like a scroll.
 The Corinthian is the most ornate capital, decorated with a profu-
sion of leaves.
The Colosseum demonstrates all three styles, or orders. Roman archi-
tects added enormously to the Greek heritage with the invention of the
arch and the vault. The dome of the Pantheon is the apogee of such art,
a model that has been copied over the centuries, not least by
Michelangelo for the cupola in St. Peter’s Basilica.
Of the country’s Christian-era churches, the earliest to be found are in
the Romanesque style, which as its name suggests drew inspiration
from Roman architecture and particularly the use of the rounded arch.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
20

These churches have thick walls and massive piers that support the
superstructure of the building, as well as bell towers with arched open-
ings. The Romanesque style has an appealing simplicity (especially in
comparison with some gaudy later developments in church architec-
ture), as you can admire in many churches in Rome, including Santa
Maria in Trastevere.
With the Gothic style, lines become longer and arches pointed, giving 
a feeling of soaring toward the sky. Rome’s only card-carrying Gothic
church, Santa Maria sopra Minerva, is a less obvious version of the
style, much restored (and, alas, mutilated) over the centuries.
With the Renaissance style, ancient architecture is rediscovered, and
proportion and balance are stressed. The classical orders have a come-
back, with the Doric in the first story of the building, the Ionic in the
middle, and the Corinthian at the top. Michelangelo’s Palazzo Farnese
in Rome is a classic example of the Renaissance style.
Eventually, the Renaissance style evolved into the more elaborate
baroque. The sweeping colonnade in front of St. Peter’s, designed by
Bernini, is considered baroque. Rome went through a huge face-lift
during the baroque period, when popes and all the important families 
in the city poured money into new palaces and churches and lavish 
decorations. If baroque was an elaboration of the Renaissance style,
rococo — the addition of all sorts of baubles and flourishes to the
underlying structure — was overkill. Perhaps the best word to describe
rococo is busy. With its twisting columns and encrusting of gold, Bernini’s
baldacchino (baldaquin, or canopy) inside St. Peter’s shows the baroque
starting to get out of hand.
A Taste of Rome: Eating Locally
Although some snobbish Italian gourmands look down on Rome as a
dining center, we think that assessment is both unfair and out of date.
Although landmark upscale restaurants used to be few in number and
not particularly good, hundreds of excellent trattorie and osterie —
small eateries, simple (if not basic) in décor, offering typical Roman 
cuisine — and pizzerie serving pizza and little else have always existed
in Rome.
Some of the best food in Rome is still served by mom-and-pop operations
that may not have a sign but serve authentic homemade cuisine. If you
poke around il centro (the historic center) or just try some of our picks,
you can find your own favorite hangout. And if you’re into upscale
eating, you’ll be happy to learn that the dining landscape has changed
dramatically in the past decade, and new gourmet restaurants have
opened all over town. You’ll find something to satisfy even the most
demanding of gourmets.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 21

As in the rest of Italy, meals are divided among primi, secondi, and con-
torni (first courses, second courses, and side dishes), with fruit or
cheese at the end. Antipasti (appetizers) to open the meal and dolci
(sweets) or gelato (ice cream) are special treats to be had on special
occasions (though we think you should indulge any time you want —
every day’s a special day on vacation).
Roman cuisine is just one style of Italian cuisine, with a number of 
local characteristics that make it unique. You’ll find many of the staples
of Italian food — all kinds of pasta, plenty of veggies, olive oil, fresh
herbs — but also a lot of specific and traditional ingredients and prepa-
rations that you won’t find elsewhere in Italy. The leitmotif of Roman 
cuisine is simplicity, with dishes based on few and fresh ingredients.
Food is always cooked with olive oil. Butter and cream don’t belong to
traditional Roman cuisine — although, of course, you’ll find those in
dishes from other Italian regions (the north in particular), which have
become common also in Rome. Parmesan cheese (the best being
Parmigiano Reggiano, the original thing from Reggio, which makes the
commercial stuff taste like sawdust) is widely used, but you’ll also find
the savory Pecorino Romano grated on traditional pasta dishes; it is 
the local sheep cheese from the Roman countryside and has a sharp,
distinctive flavor. Vegetarian dishes are common both as main dishes
(pasta dishes and secondi) and as side dishes and salads.
A little oddity in traditional restaurants and trattorie is that each day of
the week comes with a few specialties that are traditionally prepared for
that day. For example, Thursday is the day for gnocchi, and Friday is the
day for seppie coi piselli and baccalà (see “Secondo,” later in this chap-
ter). The underlying reason is that many of these dishes require lengthy
preparations, and because in the best restaurants everything is strictly
homemade, these operations are performed only once a week. Be adven-
turous, and try the local specialties when you can.
Antipasto
The tradition of antipasto is relatively recent and refers to the “munchies”
brought out to while away the time before the real meal is served. We
aren’t talking about a bowl of peanuts or potato chips, either. In regular
meals, pasta dishes (or risotto) are the appetizer, but on special occa-
sions, a large spread is brought out before the primo (of course, you can
choose to have antipasti instead of a primo if you want). With current
concern about carbs, many will chose to have antipasto instead of a
carb-loaded primo.
Traditional Roman antipasti usually include a choice of the best local
cured meats — salami, ham, and cured sausages from the area around
Rome — but also some of the best specialties from the rest of Italy, such
as the incomparable prosciutto di Parma (air-cured ham) and the lardo 
di Colonnata (a cholesterol-free lard cured in marble vats). Other typical
appetizers include insalata di mare (sliced octopus seasoned with olive
Part I: Introducing Rome 
22

oil, vinegar, and herbs), olives, and carciofini (pickled artichokes). In
pizzeria restaurants, you may also be offered bruschetta (slices of toasted
peasant-style bread dressed with olive oil, garlic, and sometimes toma-
toes), supplì (egg-shaped balls of seasoned rice filled with cheese and
deep fried), olive Ascolane (large green olives filled with meat and cheese,
battered and deep fried), or fiori di zucca (zucchini flowers filled with
cheese and anchovy and deep fried).
Primo
As everywhere in Italy, in Rome you’ll find spaghetti, penne, tagliatelle,
and innumerable other varieties of fresh pasta. The most traditional
dishes, though, are spaghetti con le vongole (with clams, no tomato),
bucatini or rigatoni all’amatriciana (a spicy tomato sauce with lard and
onions served with pecorino cheese), and pasta all’arrabbiata (tomato
and lots of hot red pepper). Another delicious traditional pasta seasoning
is gricia (lard, onions, and pecorino). You’ll also find fresh filled pasta —
particularly ravioli filled with ricotta and spinach, agnolotti (filled with
meat), cannelloni (large rolls of fresh pasta filled with meat or fish, and
baked with tomato sauce and cheese), and lasagne — the richest pasta
specialties of all.
In Rome, fresh filled pasta is usually reserved for special days — Sundays
and holidays — but it’s always on offer for the visitor. A beloved specialty
traditionally served on Thursdays is gnocchi (potato dumplings, usually in
a tomato-based sauce). You’ll also usually find at least one kind of risotto
on the menu, a typical dish of somewhat sticky but very tasty seasoned
Italian rice. In seafood restaurants, you’ll find risotto alla pescatora (with
fresh shellfish and a bit of tomato); in other restaurants, you’ll find veg-
etable-based risotto of various kinds depending on the season — with arti-
chokes, asparagus, or radicchio, among others. Soups are also present on
the menu, especially in the traditional dishes of minestrone (a thick veg-
etable and bean soup) and pasta e ceci (a thick savory soup of pasta and
chickpeas, usually served on Thursdays).
Secondo
Tradition holds that Romans eat fish on Tuesdays and Fridays, and meat
the other days of the week, with vegetarian dishes always acceptable.
Although few Romans still observe these traditions at home, you’ll find
that they are more than happy that Roman trattorie do, and you’ll find
them gaily eating the daily specials — so much so that if you arrive too
late, the specials will be gone.
Although most trattorie offer fish every day, you’ll find a greater variety 
of seafood dishes offered on Tuesdays and Fridays, especially those tradi-
tional seafood dishes such as seppie coi piselli (cuttlefish stewed with
peas) and baccalà (salted cod prepared in a stew with potatoes). Among
the best traditional meat dishes are the abbacchio arrosto (young lamb
roasted with herbs), scottadito (literally “finger burning” — thin grilled
lamb cutlets), and saltimbocca alla romana (literally “jump in your mouth
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 23

Roman style” — thin slices of veal or beef rolled with ham and sage and
sautéed with a bit of wine). For the more adventurous, there is trippa alla
romana (tripe Roman style, stewed with a light tomato sauce) or coda alla
vaccinara (oxtail stew).
Contorno and salads
When you order a secondo in a restaurant, it will come without a side
dish; you’ll have to order that separately — convenient for vegetarians
who can always have the full choice of vegetables prepared for the day.
Cooked greens are very common, and you’ll always find a choice of 
cicoria (dandelions), spinach, or bieda (swiss chard); they’ll offer them
all’agro (seasoned with oil and lemon juice) or ripassati (sautéed with
garlic and hot pepper). Other traditional contorni are patate arrosto
(roasted potatoes deliciously prepared with fresh herbs), patate fritte
(french fries), and fagiolini (green beans — but beware; they are well
cooked and seasoned with olive oil and lemon juice). When in season —
from January through March — you’ll find the unique carciofi Romani
(wonderful artichokes you can eat in their entirety — no spines, woody
leaves, or barbs inside to contend with).
You’ll also always find salad, usually a simple affair of plain lettuce, but
you can usually ask for tomatoes; sometimes it’s more elaborate, with
thinly sliced carrots and fennel in addition to sliced tomatoes and let-
tuce leaves. A special kind of salad that’s very common in the summer
(lots of people with their swimsuit size in mind order it as a main course)
is the Caprese, made of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil; sometimes
it will be made with the famous mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella)
imported from nearby Campania. All these salads are served unsea-
soned, with olive oil and vinegar on the side.
Last but not least is puntarelle, our favorite contorno. It’s a specialty in
early spring in Rome. This side dish is made from the stalks of the cico-
ria plant, which are peeled and served (uncooked) with garlic, anchovy,
and olive oil.
Dolci and desserts
Most working people will end their meal with a piece of fresh fruit or a
piece of cheese (usually, local pecorino), and indeed, Rome is not partic-
ularly famous for its sweets. You’ll also find macedonia (fruit cut in small
pieces and served with sugar syrup) and, when in season, fresh straw-
berries with whipped cream.
This doesn’t mean your sweet tooth will go unsatisfied — not by a long
shot. Among the most common desserts are creme caramel and the tra-
ditional crostata (tart) in two main versions: crostata alla marmellata
(tart with homemade jam) and crostata della nonna (tart filled with
pastry cream and pine nuts). Other desserts include bignè alla crema
(puff-pastry balls filled with cream, covered with dark chocolate, and
Part I: Introducing Rome 
24

served with whipped cream) and tiramisù (layers of mascarpone cheese
and espresso-soaked ladyfingers).
You’ll also always find ice cream (gelato), but it will rarely be homemade
in a restaurant, and you’re definitely better off waiting and having your
ice cream at a proper ice-cream parlor. There, you’ll also find granita
(frozen coffee or lemon ice), which is very refreshing and low in calories
(unless you add real whipped cream to your coffee granita, which is deli-
cious). The main attraction, gelato, comes in a variety of fruit and cream
flavors (see Chapter 10), but one of our favorites is zabaglione (a cream
made with sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala wine, similar in taste to eggnog).
Wines
The best-known Roman wines come from the nearby Castelli Romani (hill
towns to the east of the city; see Chapter 14). Among these, the white vari-
eties — such as the Frascati — are especially good, very dry and treacher-
ously refreshing. Other excellent wines come from the region of Viterbo,
near Tarquinia and the Lago di Vico (see Chapter 14), such as the famous
Est, Est, Est! and the dessert muscat wine Aleatico di Gradoli.
Word to the Wise: The Local Language
Italian is Rome’s primary language; however, if you know it a bit, or if your
ear is particularly good, you’ll notice that in Rome people speak differ-
ently than in other parts of Italy. Roman is the local dialect, a very colorful
lingo that has given life to a rich heritage of poetry — Trilussa is the most
famous poet writing in Roman dialect — and popular sayings, often full of
a witty philosophy, which are sometimes quite untranslatable.
The other language you can resort to is sign language. Actually, other
Italians make fun of Romans for using their hands so much. In Rome, your
hands talk — both to emphasize your words and to convey further mean-
ing. If you don’t speak any Italian, many Romans will go out of their way to
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 25
The etiquette of drinking
Don’t expect to order a martini before dinner — in many restaurants, and more par-
ticularly in trattorie, osterie, and pizzerie, you probably won’t find a full bar, because
Romans simply don’t drink liquor before dinner. And unless they’re in a pub, Italians
don’t drink alcohol at all without eating something (you won’t see a waiter bring out
wine before putting some food on the table). You’re likely to find liquor in larger, more
touristy restaurants, where you can ask for a scotch and water and won’t be rewarded
with a perplexed stare. Elsewhere, follow the “when in Rome” rule: Have an aperitivo
at a bar; follow with wine over dinner; and have a grappa (a clear brandy) or an amaro
(a 60- to 80-proof bitter drink, made with herbs) after your meal.

Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Rome has been the subject or the background of innumerable works,
both of fiction and nonfiction. We have excluded guidebooks from 
the suggestions in this section — you’ll find those recommended in
Appendix A. Whether you want to bone up on history or be entertained
by sights of the Eternal City, here are a few surefire choices.
True stories
The following nonfiction favorites will not only expand your knowledge
of Rome, but also will be pure reading pleasure:
 Polybius was a Greek hostage in Rome for 16 years in the second
century B.C., during which he wrote his Histories (reprinted by
Regnery/Gateway as Polybius on Roman Imperialism and by
Penguin as The Rise of the Roman Empire) to explain “by what
means and under what kind of constitution, almost the whole
inhabited world was conquered and brought under the dominion 
of the single city of Rome, and that, too, within a period of not 
quite fifty-three years” (219–167 B.C.).
 The Roman historian Tacitus is one of our primary sources of infor-
mation — and lurid stories — about the early emperors, including
Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero. His Annals have been pub-
lished in the Penguin Classics series as The Annals of Imperial
Rome and reprinted many times since.
 If you read 25 pages a day, it’ll take you only about four months 
to get through Edward Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire (begun in 1776), a monument of English prose 
in several volumes. (You can find a less monumental Penguin
abridged version in paperback.)
 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was the first great modern literary
visitor to Italy, and his wonderful Italian Journey (1816) contains a
few great pages on Rome as it was at the time of his visit.
 Shortly following Goethe, Stendhal — the famous author of The
Red and the Black and The Charterhouse of Parma — visited Rome
and fell deeply in love with the city. You can read his impressions 
in Three Italian Chronicles (1826–1829).
Part I: Introducing Rome

Art history
When you visit Rome, you will see art, and in particular Renaissance art,
everywhere you look. Here are a few books to help you brush up on the
subject of Roman art:
 Italian Giorgio Vasari was a painter, architect, and (literally)
Renaissance man. His Lives of the Most Eminent Painters and
Sculptors (1550; expanded in 1568) has been criticized for inaccu-
racy but is full of interesting information about the great painters 
of the Renaissance. The Oxford edition (1998) is one of the many
abridgements in translation of this huge work.
 Benvenuto Cellini’s famous Autobiography (1728) presents a vivid
picture of Cellini’s time in Renaissance Florence and Rome.
 Karl Ludwig Gallwitz’s recent Handbook of Italian Renaissance
Painters (1999) gives you an at-a-glance guide to 1,200 Italian
painters; it also has some nice reproductions, brief essays on the
major schools of painting, and some weird charts that show who
influenced whom. You may want to peruse it before you go if 
you’re really into art — it’s softcover and not very thick, so you
may even want to bring it along.
Works of fiction
A good novel is often one of the best ways to acquaint yourself with 
a place, allowing you to immerse yourself in its culture. Our choices
include excellent books on both modern and ancient Rome: 
 Alberto Moravia, one of the great Italian writers of the 20th cen-
tury, wrote many novels and short stories but none as famous as
The Conformist (1951), a study of the Fascist personality. He also
wrote two novels about Rome and Romans: Roman Tales (1954) 
and The Woman of Rome (1949).
 Robert Graves wrote two novels — I, Claudius (1934) and its
sequel, Claudius the God (1934) — about the best of Augustus’s
Claudian successors. Although they’re works of fiction, they’re a
highly entertaining way to learn about the glory and decadence of
Imperial Rome.
 Henry James’s great novel The Portrait of a Lady (1881) — recently
turned into a movie (see the next section) — unveils the heart of
Rome as seen by a young American woman in the 19th century.
 Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz won the Nobel Prize in 1905
largely on the strength of his monumental Quo Vadis? (1896), set 
in Rome during the time of Nero and concerning the relationship
between a Christian woman and a Roman soldier.
 Carlo Emilio Gadda’s novel That Horrible Mess in Via Merulana
(1954) is a wonderful Italian thriller; it was also adapted on the
screen in Pietro Germi’s film The Facts of Murder (1959).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 27

The moving image
Rome has been the subject or the setting of several hit films over the
years. Of course, Roman and Italian directors have used Rome as the
background for many of their masterpieces. Fellini is the author of one
of the most famous Italian films of all time, La Dolce Vita (1960), but his
beloved Rome figures in many of his other movies, including The Nights
of Cabiria (1957), a touching story showing unusual views of the city.
Vittorio De Sica got his second Oscar with The Bicycle Thief (1948) and
kept going with Umberto D. (1952) and Yesterday Today and Tomorrow
(1963). Rossellini’s Open City (1945) is another masterpiece, as is
Pasolini’s Mamma Roma (1962). Bernardo Bertolucci gained fame with
The Conformist (1970), an adaptation of Moravia’s novel (see the preced-
ing section), but Rome appears in other of his great movies, such as the
psychological Luna (1979) and the dramatic Besieged (1998).
International directors have also loved Rome, beginning with the 
many movies that re-created the grandeur of Imperial Rome: William
Wyler’s Ben-Hur (1959); Mervyn LeRoy’s Quo Vadis (1951); Joseph L.
Mankiewicz’s Cleopatra (1963); Anthony Mann’s The Fall of the Roman
Empire (1964); and Spartacus (1960), the Oscar-winning Kirk Douglas
movie about a slave revolt in ancient Rome (Spartacus’s story actually
took place in Capua). It was a precursor to Ridley Scott’s Gladiator
(2000), which also gives a visceral feel for the brutal side of the empire.
Also treading the paths of ancient Rome is Julie Taymor, in her Titus
(1999), an adaptation from Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus.
Innumerable movies have been set in Rome, both oldies and recent 
successes. William Wyler’s famous Roman Holiday (1953), the Gregory
Peck–Audrey Hepburn romance, is said to have caused a surge in
tourism to Rome. Jean Negulesco’s Three Coins in the Fountain (1954)
was a great hit, followed by Vincent Minnelli’s Two Weeks in Another
Town (1962) and Jean-Luc Goddard’s Contempt (1963). More recently,
Rome has been portrayed or appears in cameo in an increasing number
of movies: from Peter Greenaway’s Belly of an Architect (1987) to Michael
Lehmann’s madcap art-theft caper Hudson Hawk (1990). Rome even
turns up in Gus Van Sant’s My Own Private Idaho (1991), as well as in
Norman Jewison’s Only You (1996), Anthony Mingella’s The Talented 
Mr. Ripley (1999), and the final scene of Neil Labute’s Nurse Betty (2000).
Rome was used more extensively in Jane Campion’s The Portrait of a
Lady (1996), based on Henry James’s novel.

R
ome has offered unending surprises and pleasures to its visitors for
over 2,000 years, and the large wave of restorations and reorganiza-
tion that started in the 1990s in preparation for the Millennium celebra-
tions and the Papal Jubilee in 2000 — and still ongoing — have brought
back the splendor to many long-neglected monuments and sights, like the
soot-blackened Palazzo Farnese and the long-closed Palazzo Senatorio,
now part of the completely restructured Capitoline Museums. Also, many
hotels and restaurants got face-lifts, but perhaps more important, the
tourist industry and the art and cultural management have started think-
ing in a modern way that makes things easier for international tourists:
longer opening hours, Web sites, information hotlines, cumulative tickets,
air-conditioning, shuttle services, and so on. More than ever, tourists are
welcome in the Eternal City, and the added benefit of the euro makes
things a lot easier for visitors used to dollars or pounds — no more 3,500-
lire ice-cream cones or shoes costing a cool quarter million.
Rome, though, is also a large metropolis, with its very own cultural and
logistic quirks that can make your visit more or less pleasant depending
on when you go. Here, we give you tips to plan what we hope will be
your own best trip ever.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Rome has a warm, dry climate with well-defined seasons. Winters are
mild, and what Romans call “bitter cold” is temperatures around 30°F
(–4°C), which rarely happen during the day. In summer the weather is
hot, but not as humid as it gets in, say, Washington, D.C.; however, the
sun will beat down on you in August in the Roman Forum, making things
rather unpleasant if you’re sensitive to heat.

You know your limits. If the idea of waiting in line for two hours in the
hot sun to get into the Vatican Museums sounds unendurable, don’t
come to Rome in July or August. Check the average temperatures we list
in Table 3-1 before you plan your trip.
Most of the rain usually falls in the late fall and winter (it rarely snows in
Rome — maybe once every ten years), with November usually being the
most rainy month. However, heavy and short-lasting thunderstorms are
common, not only during the fall and winter, but also in the spring and
summer (particularly in August), and the occasional rainy day — rarely
more than two in a row — can happen all year around but particularly
from fall to spring.

The once well-defined high season for tourism has become somewhat
blurred and variable. As more and more people travel to Italy at all times,
the off season is shrinking. Currently, hotels in Rome consider high
season mid-March to June, September to mid-October, and December 24
to January 6. Low season is July and August, as well as January and
February. The rest is shoulder season, during which the application of
higher rates depends on the hotel. As a general guideline, high season
starts earlier and lasts longer for smaller and cheaper hotels (which
tend to fill faster). The reverse is true for more expensive hotels.
Here are what we consider to be the pros and cons for traveling in each
season.
April through June
In our opinion, spring and early summer are the most pleasant time to
visit Rome:
 Temperatures are moderate, and the weather is mild, making it a
pleasure to walk through the city both during the day and at night.
 Limited rainfall allows you to get out and enjoy the outdoor 
activities — without worrying about excess heat and sunstroke.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
30

But keep in mind:
 Everybody knows this is a great season — including hotels and air-
lines, which jack up their prices. Make your reservations as early as
possible, particularly for small, highly desirable hotels.
 Around Easter time, vast numbers of Catholic pilgrims and large
groups of very noisy schoolchildren from all around the world
descend on Rome. Plan your museum visits carefully, and definitely
make reservations.
 May 1 is Labor Day in Italy, and all workers in Rome have the day
off, including waiters in restaurants, shopkeepers, and bus drivers.
Everything shuts down, even public transportation.
July and August
Summertime is when most people take their vacations, and there are
many upsides:
 The weather is beautiful, and outdoor life — especially in the sweet
evenings — is at its max.
 You can get discount rates in most hotels.
 There is little traffic because residents tend to escape to the
seashore, especially on weekends.
On the other hand, it might also be the worst time to come to Rome:
 Airfares are high.
 You can expect long lines for major attractions, because many
tourists visit in this period.
 The heat can make things quite uncomfortable — temperatures
during the day often soar into the 90s, and Roman ruins turn into
ovens (also, Rome is still mostly non-air-conditioned).
 Many shops and restaurants close during August, most definitely
on August 15, the Italian holiday of Ferragosto.
September and October
Next to spring, fall is our favorite time to travel to Italy. Here’s why:
 The weather is still fairly mild and pleasant.
 With school back in session, crowds are relatively sparse.
On the other hand:
 Hotel prices are high.
 You have to watch for the rain, which typically starts falling in
October.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 31

November through March
More and more vacationers are reaping the benefits of traveling to Italy
in the winter; if you can put up with rain and occasional cold spells, this
is an excellent time for traveling to Rome:
 The relatively mild weather keeps the city pleasant for touring.
Rain is at its heaviest in November and December but is usually
manageable, with short-lived heavy rainfalls followed by periods 
of calm.
 You can enjoy your visits more, because there are fewer crowds at
the prime attractions, and you often receive better and more atten-
tive service.
 Except for the Christmas–New Year period, airfares and hotel rates
are at their lowest.
 On a rainy day in November, we once found the Pantheon almost
empty.
But keep in mind:
 Although average temperatures are mild, and cold spells tend to be
short lived, it can get quite chilly. Depending on how resistant you
are to colder temperatures, you may not be able to enjoy some of
the outdoor attractions.
 Traffic is at its worst because most people take their cars to go to
work and shopping when it gets nippy; correspondingly, air- and
noise-pollution levels rise.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Rome has many events worth planning a holiday around. Alternatively,
you can use the following calendar to avoid big events and their atten-
dant crowds.
Most Christian holidays — not just Christmas and Easter, but also 
saints’ days and Tutti Santi (All Saints’ Day, Nov 1) — are marked by
some kind of celebration and often by processions and special foods.
January
Celebrate the new year with your children in Piazza del Popolo,
and watch the clowns, acrobats, papier-mâché masks, and other fun
attractions. Contact the tourist info line for a schedule of events at 
% 06-36004399. January 1.
The religious holiday Epifania (Feast of the Epiphany) takes a secular
turn in Rome, and children receive special gifts on this day — more than
Part I: Introducing Rome 
32

on Christmas. The open-air fair in Piazza Navona selling children’s toys
and gifts stays open until the wee hours of the morning. January 6.
February
In Rome, as everywhere else in Italy, Carnevale swallows up the week
before Ash Wednesday, culminating on Fat Tuesday or Martedi Grasso.
During this former pagan rite of the coming of spring, people — especially
children — dress up in costumes and participate in masked parties.
Everyone celebrates Carnevale to one degree or another — at least by
eating frappe (thin slices of crunchy fried dough with powdered sugar)
and castagnole (deep-fried balls of dough, often filled with custard). In
Rome, you can find concerts and organized events, as well as lots of
people parading around the city (particularly along Via Veneto) in cos-
tume on Fat Tuesday evening. Call the tourist office at % 06-4889991 or
check www.comune.roma.it for details. Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.
March and April
Every year, more than 40 directors from over 25 countries participate 
in RIFF, the Roma Independent Film Festival (% 06-45425050; www.
riff.it). One week in March or April.
On the high holy day of Venerdì Santo (Good Friday), the Catholic rite
of the procession of the stations of the cross (Via Crucis) is presented in
most Roman churches, sometimes as a reenactment with costumes. The
Vatican’s procession takes place at night, led by the pope, between the
Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Friday before Easter Sunday.
The pope gives his traditional Benedizione Pasquale (Easter Benedic-
tion) in Piazza San Pietro. Easter Sunday, between the end of March and
mid-April.
During the Mostra delle Azalee (Exhibition of Azaleas), more than 700
azalea plants are exhibited on the Spanish Steps in Rome to celebrate
the beginning of spring. Concerts are held in Trinità dei Monti at the
head of the steps. Call % 06-4889991 for more information. The period
of the festival has recently been extended. Mid-April through July, weather
dependent.
Tradition has it that Romulus founded Rome — by tracing its original
limits on the ground — on April 21 in the year 753 B.C. The day, Rome’s
Birthday (Natale di Roma), is still warmly celebrated in Rome with a
series of cultural events. Contact the tourist info line at % 06-36004399
for more information. April 21.
May
For Labor Day (Festa del Lavoro), everything shuts down except 
in Piazza San Giovanni, where the holiday is celebrated with a great 
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 33

pop-music festival (check the tourist info line for a program of events at
% 06-36004399). May 1.
Rome’s Concorso Ippico Internazionale (International Horse Show)
attracts the best riders and mounts from all over the world to Villa
Borghese’s beautiful Piazza di Siena. You can buy tickets at the gate. For
details, contact the ticket agent of the Piazza di Siena at % 06-6383818
or visit www.piazzadisiena.com. Near the end of May.
June
The Estate Romana (Roman Summer) is a multifarious festival with an
extremely rich program of concerts, theater, special exhibits, and other
events throughout Rome lasting into September. Performances held
inside Roman ruins are particularly dramatic. See Chapters 15 and 16 
for details, or call % 06-4889991 or visit www.estateromana.comune.
roma.it. Mid- to late June through early September.
July
An aside of the Estate Romana festival (see preceding section), Fiesta!
(Ippodromo delle Capannelle, Via Appia Nuova 1245; % 06-7182139) cel-
ebrates Latin American music and culture by featuring concerts, films,
theater, and children’s activities. Late June to mid-August.
Another offshoot of the Estate Romana festival is the Villa Celimontana
Jazz (Via della Navicella; % 06-77208423; www.villacelimontana
jazz.com), where jazz concerts by international and national musicians
are held in the picturesque setting of the Villa Celimontana park. June
through August.
August
A section of the Testaccio neighborhood becomes Gay Village (% 340-
5423008; www.gayvillage.it), a small town of tolerance and culture
where gay and straight mingle to enjoy dining, music, and a variety of
artistic performances for all age groups. Late June to early September.
The pagan holiday of Ferragosto — and the religious holy day of the
Assumption — celebrates the culmination of the summer. Romans vaca-
tion on the seashore and in the mountains. Most businesses are closed,
so call ahead to make sure your destination is open. August 15.
September
The Romaeuropa Festival (% 800-795525; www.romaeuropa.net) is a
cultural extravaganza, presenting the best innovative and experimental
European dance, music, and theater performances. It celebrated its 20th
season in 2005, and its success continues unabated. End of September 
to end of November.

October
The Festa di San Francesco d’Assisi (Feast of St. Francis of Assisi), a
celebration for the patron saint of Italy, is observed with processions,
special masses, and other religious events. October 4.
November
One hundred artists are selected for the Cento Pittori Via Margutta
exhibit, which turns scenic Via Margutta into an open-air gallery twice 
a year. Contact the tourist info line at % 06-36004399 for precise dates.
November and April/May.
December
For Rome’s Crèche Exhibit, more than 50 nativity scenes are displayed 
in the Villa Giulia, and many others are on view in churches around the
city. Particularly nice are the ones in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore,
Santa Maria d’Aracoeli (see Chapter 11), Santa Maria del Popolo (Piazza
del Popolo 12; % 06-3610487), and Chiesa del Gesù (Piazza del Gesù, off
Via del Plebiscito; % 06-6795131). Don’t miss the life-size nativity scene
in front of St. Peter’s, either. The three weeks leading up to Christmas.
Piazza Navona becomes the seat of the Mercatino di Natale (Christmas
Market), with toys and candy sellers. The market starts three weeks
before Christmas and stays open all night on its last day, January 5, 
the night of the Epiphany. Beginning of December through January 6 
at dawn.
If you don’t mind crowds or getting up early, you can witness the pope
giving a special Christmas Blessing to Rome and the world from St.
Peter’s Square at noon on Christmas Day. For a chance of being in the
square, you should get there by 9 a.m. December 25.
Romans love New Year’s Eve, and partying reaches its climax at mid-
night, when the city explodes — literally — with fireworks. The Vatican
puts on its own fiery show, and there’s an organized concert–cum–
fireworks show in Piazza del Popolo, but everybody gets into the act,
shooting fireworks from every window and roof. By tradition, fireworks
are accompanied by the symbolic throwing away of something old to
mark the end of the old year. Although the tradition has been outlawed,
some people still get carried away, so watch out for falling UFOs if you
take a stroll shortly after midnight! December 31.

t’s time to delve into the nitty-gritty of trip planning: all
those details that are necessary to make your vacation as
perfect as possible. We give you some tips on budgeting —
how to save a few euro here and there — and tell you what to
expect in terms of banks and currency exchange. We also lay
out the different ways you can get to Rome, including various
travel packages, and offer suggestions on buying travel insur-
ance, staying healthy, and staying in contact with those who
didn’t get to make the trip. And so everyone has a good time,
we also offer advice to those people who have special travel

 Saving money
W
hen it comes to planning a vacation budget, you usually deal with
two different numbers: what you’d like to spend and what you
can spend. In this chapter, we give you some pointers to help you decide
where to trim on the incidentals and splurge just on the things that really
matter to you, so that you can design a terrific vacation without break-
ing the bank.
Planning Your Budget
Budgeting your vacation dollars is easy; it’s the choices — and the 
mistakes — that hurt. We figure there are six major elements that eat 
up your vacation budget: transportation, lodging, dining, sightseeing,
shopping, and nightlife. How well in advance you plan certain elements
can make or break your budget.
Consider transportation: If you wait until mid-June to reserve a flight to
Rome for July, you’ll be lucky to pay $1,000 — if you can find a seat at all.
Book ahead, and you might save a couple hundred bucks that you could
put toward a shopping splurge.
Lodging is another big-ticket item. You can save on lodging and get the
cost down around $120 a night if you’re willing to forgo amenities and
put up with a certain amount of inconvenience (less-central location,
shared bath, and so on). How elastic your budget is will depend on how
flexible you are. And if you book all your hotels in advance, you’ll know
that piece of the budget before you leave.
In Rome, dining is a great place to save money because the food is so
good everywhere, even in the cheapest eateries. Pizza is cheap, and 
so is a bowl of pasta, though it may be the best you ever tasted. Armed
with a corkscrew and a plastic fork, you can assemble a fine picnic 

lunch from the supermarket, using ingredients you won’t find anywhere
in your local grocery.
The following sections provide more tips and consideration as you 
plan your budget. Table 4-1 gives you a sampling of costs that you may
encounter on your trip. Oh, yes, and don’t forget taxes — we cover that
topic in Appendix A.

Transportation
Airfare is one of the biggest components of your budget. Keeping it low
gives you a sort of cushion for the rest of your expenses. The actual cost
depends on the time that you travel (but booking in advance helps, too).
In high season, you’re lucky to find a round-trip ticket for less than $850;
other times, though, you may find tickets for half that much. Make sure
that you check out our money-saving tips before buying an airline ticket
(see Chapter 5).
Moving within Rome after you’re there is quite inexpensive — for exam-
ple, a three-day public transportation pass is only 11€ ($14). Out-of-
town trips are cheap, too, if you use public transportation. You have 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome

to budget more if you’re planning to take a tour, hire a limousine, or rent
a car — a rather expensive proposition in Rome.
Keep in mind that in Rome you absolutely don’t need a car, and if you
arrive there with one, you have to keep it garaged during your entire
stay. Rome has too many roads and drivers for you to want to deal with,
plus it bans nonresidents from driving in il centro (the historic center),
which is the part of the city where most of the attractions lie. Also,
organized thieves steal cars and from cars, and you don’t want the risk.
If you feel you need a car for a day trip — and a thrilling adventure that
might turn into a nightmare — rent one for the occasion by all means,
but expect to pay a minimum of 70€ ($91) per day for an economy car
and about 5.05€ ($6.55) per gallon of gas.
Lodging
Accommodations in Rome probably aren’t much like the hotel or motel
in your hometown. For one thing, your lodging is likely to be in a build-
ing that went up when your hometown was still a big empty spot on 
the map. And originally, the building may have been a princely palazzo,
a grand townhouse, or a spartan monastery. Hotel bathrooms are often
tiny, and it’s easy to see why. Buildings are much older than in the
United States, and private bathrooms were added to existing rooms, 
creating sometimes-funky results. Be aware that in many smaller hotels,
rooms still exist with a shared bath down the hall and just a sink (or
nothing) in the room itself.
We list many renovated hotels in this book, but keep in mind that space
is at a premium in Rome, especially in the city historical center (see
Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion of what you can expect in Rome’s
hotel rooms), and that if you want spacious accommodations — both 
in the room and the bathroom — you have to be willing to fork over
extra euro. On the other hand, you can save a lot of money if you don’t
mind smaller private facilities and a simpler room.
Prices also vary depending on which area of Rome you choose for your
lodgings. Figure that 150€ ($195) buys you a decent double room with
private bath anywhere in Rome, but 230€ ($299) buys you a nice room
in the historical center. From 350€ ($455) and up, you’re buying a luxury
room, probably close to the most famous attractions. Of course, the
amounts that these estimates represent in dollars constantly vary
according to the current currency exchange rates.
You can save money if you renounce the breakfast that your hotel 
serves unless it’s included with your room rate (which we indicate in
our reviews in Chapter 9). Breakfast is worth paying for only at the more
expensive hotels ($$$ and above), where you find a buffet with a variety
of foods, usually including eggs, sausage, cheese, cold cuts, yogurt, fruit,
and cereal. This kind of breakfast may run about 20€ ($26), so you have
to decide if what you get is worth the money.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

In all the hotel reviews in this guide, we supply the rack rate, which in
Rome is the highest rate the hotel will charge you (at the peak of high
season and when the hotel is completely full). You should be able to do
better than that in most cases. See Chapter 9 for a table indicating what
the $ symbols in our writeups ($–$$$$) mean.
Dining
As in any destination, you can spend a lot or a little when it comes to
dining in Rome. For example, less-formal restaurants (called pizzerie,
trattorie, osterie, and rosticcerie) often offer the best combination of
quality and price. You can generally count on all of these having tradi-
tional fare served in simple surroundings. Pizzerie (obviously) special-
ize in pizza; trattorie and osterie are casual, often family-run restaurants
serving full, hearty meals at relatively inexpensive prices; and rostic-
cerie are cafeterias with pre-prepared hot dishes and roasting chickens
in the window. Of course, you can find some famous ristorante (restau-
rants) that are both elegant and pricey and serve fantastic food, but 
the equation high price = good food is not at all a certain bet in Rome —
which is good news if you want to save a bit of money in this area.
To confuse the issue even further, the names of the different eateries are
not as descriptive as they once were. Many high-priced joints take the
name trattoria for its homey, feel-good vibe, and smaller places anoint
themselves as ristorante to try to class up the place. When in doubt,
always go for the simpler option. Chances are you’ll get homemade
cooking for only a few dollars.
Pranzo (lunch) used to be the big meal in Rome, where the lunch “hour”
was more like one-and-a-half to two hours, but things are changing, and
you can have a small lunch in any restaurant now. Lunch prices may 
also be cheaper than dinner, so in most places, two people can eat a 
nice lunch with a half-liter of wine for about 40€ to 50€ ($52–$65) or a
smaller meal for about 30€ ($39). Dinner in the same type of place will
be 60€ ($78) and up for two.
Most restaurants impose a basic table-and-bread charge, called pane e
coperto, of about 2€ to 4€ ($2.60–$5.20), and service is usually included
(look for the words servizio incluso on the menu) unless otherwise
noted. If it’s not, leave a 10 to 15 percent tip on the table if service was
satisfactory.
We give you our restaurant recommendations in Chapter 10, and just 
as with the hotels, we use a dollar-sign system to alert you to the prices
of restaurants. See the table near the beginning of Chapter 10 for an
explanation of the $ symbols ($–$$$$). These prices reflect a per-person
charge for a meal consisting of a pasta or appetizer, a main course (sec-
ondi), a side dish (called a contorno in Italy), and dessert. It does not
include wine or alcoholic drinks, the prices of which can vary widely.
Within the listing information we give you the price range of just the
main course, listed as secondi.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
42
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 

More and more Roman restaurants are adding a side dish to the entree.
It used to be that if you ordered grilled salmon as your main course,
that’s what you got — just grilled salmon. Now you may find a side dish
such as a vegetable sharing the plate.
On a tight budget? Try our splurge-and-save approach to dining: If we
really want to try a particular expensive restaurant, we make up for the
extra outlay by eating a lunch or dinner of fresh bread, locally cured pro-
sciutto, regional cheeses, raw or cooked vegetables, and local wine or
mineral water, all of which you can find at a local supermarket or food
store, or by buying a pound or so of just-out-of-the-oven pizza to go at 
a local rosticceria or pizza a taglio shop (see Chapter 10 for our recom-
mendations). A picnic lunch is also a great way to visit some of the out-
door sights.
Sightseeing
Museums and other attractions charge anywhere from 2€ to 12€ ($2.60–
$16) for admission. Most churches are free (avoid visiting during serv-
ices unless you’re attending the service, however). Frankly, sightseeing
isn’t an area where you can save a lot of money, and you’ll probably be
sorry if you try. On the other hand, entrance fees for most attractions
aren’t that expensive to begin with (with some notable exceptions), 
so your budget won’t be stretched to its limits by daily sightseeing
expenditures.
In Chapter 11, we note all the special combination discount tickets and
special discount cards, which can represent a great savings.
Beware that many special discounts are available based on reciprocity
between countries. Therefore, many discounts — senior and children
discounts especially — aren’t available to Americans but are available 
to British and other residents of European Union (EU) countries.
Because of the long lines at times of great tourist influx, many major
attractions in Rome have started offering advance ticketing. You can now
make reservations before you leave home, thus bypassing waits of up to
three hours. The list of attractions for which you can make reservations
includes the Galleria Borghese and the Colosseum. We indicate in the
reviews in Chapter 11 whether an attraction offers advance ticketing.
Shopping
Shopping is the one expenditure that is totally within your control: You
can shop ’til you drop, spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars,
or you can limit yourself to window shopping. In Chapter 12, we give 
you our recommendations for the best shops and items that each neigh-
borhood offers. Rome is famous for its artwork, design, and crafts —
antique prints, handmade paper, plaster works, pottery, leather, gold,
and lace, among many other fine wares. And the city isn’t half bad for
Italian fashion — Valentino, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, and Armani are 
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43

a few of the world-famous Italian firms located in Rome, to which you
can add the local designers.
Depending on exchange rates, you may actually save by buying Italian
goods in Rome. More important, though, being in Rome gives you a
chance to buy things that simply aren’t available, or not in such variety,
back home. Use your trip as a chance to pick up that special something
you have an irresistible craving for — maybe a print of the Pantheon, 
a handmade golden necklace, a Gucci handbag, or even a nice used
Ferrari (just kidding). Remember to plan in your budget enough shop-
ping money for the kind of goods you think you might want to buy, and
remember also that you can get back the value-added tax (VAT) for large
purchases (see Chapter 12).
Nightlife
Visiting the opera, going out for a drink, listening to music in a jazz club,
and dancing the night away are all extra pleasures that will make your
time in Rome that much more memorable. You can spend big bucks in
this department, or you can cut your costs by enjoying those serendipi-
tous little things that are free or nearly so, such as people-watching on 
a beautiful floodlit piazza or ordering a coffee or drink in a classic caffè
and soaking in the atmosphere.
Ticket prices for performances can vary a good deal, from 10€ ($13) 
for a concert at a small venue to 120€ ($156) for the best seat at the
opera. Nightclubs in Rome are about as expensive as anywhere else, 
but you may be able to avoid a cover charge by sitting or standing at 
the bar rather than taking a table or by arriving before a certain hour. 
If you happen to be in Rome during a public holiday or festival, you 
may enjoy abundant free entertainment, much of it in the streets.
Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
Don’t feel like taking out a second mortgage on your house so you 
can afford a vacation to Rome? Well, you know the saying: “When in
Rome . . . .” Start thinking like a Roman. Romans have relatively less 
disposable income than Americans; the closer you mirror the way 
they live and move about town, the cheaper your trip will be — and 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
44
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
Don’t sit to sip
Be aware that any time you sit down in a caffè or bar in Italy, things cost more. Coffee
at an outside table in Piazza del Popolo or Piazza Navona, for example, may cost the
same as lunch elsewhere. Most Italians stand at the bar while they have a coffee or
a beer.

the closer you get to the Romans themselves. Staying in a huge hotel
designed for foreign tourists with all the fixings will cost you a lot, as 
will the luxury of renting a big car. Tack on a few five-star-restaurant
experiences, and your budget flies out the window.
Instead, try to live for a week without your own private bathroom. Make
big, healthy sandwiches from the delicious stuff you bought in a market.
Pass on the postcards, trinkets, and other things that you pick up just 
to say that you’ve been to Rome — you may even save enough for a
splurge here and there.
But remember that sometimes, paying more makes sense. For example,
if you’re facing sightseeing overload and are dead tired, you may not
want to take an hourlong bus ride to the other side of town to your
hotel. Take a cab instead. And why not grab a bite to eat in the more
expensive cafe near your hotel rather than deal with crossing town to 
an extra-cheap restaurant? Plus there are areas where you shouldn’t
make cuts: Not seeing Rome’s Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, or
the Colosseum, or the Galleria Borghese, or some other major sight just
because they cost more would be a tragedy. We’d rather skip lunch and
take the opportunity to go to one of these must-sees twice. Who knows
when you’ll be back that way again?
Throughout this book, we use the Bargain Alert icon to identify money-
saving tips and/or great deals. Here are some additional cost-cutting
strategies:
 Go off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times (Nov–Mar, with
the exception of the Christmas/New Year’s holidays), you can find
airfares and hotel prices as much as 30 percent less than during
peak months.
 Travel during off-peak days of the week. Airfares vary depending
not only on the time of the year, but also on the day of the week.
International flights tend to be cheaper midweek. When you inquire
about airfares, ask whether you can obtain a cheaper rate by flying
on a different day. (See Chapter 5 for more tips on getting a good
fare.)
 Try a package tour. For popular destinations like Rome, you can
book airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some sight-
seeing by making just one call to a travel agent or packager, and you
may pay a lot less than if you tried to put the trip together yourself.
But always work out the prices that you’d pay if you arranged the
pieces of your trip yourself, just to double-check. See the section on
package tours in Chapter 5 for specific suggestions.
 Pack light. Packing light enables you to carry your own bags and
not worry about finding a porter (don’t forget to tip yourself).
Likewise, if you’re carrying only one or two bags, you can take a
bus or a train rather than a cab from the airport, saving yourself
quite a few more euro.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 45

 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; most hotels have
minifridges, and some have coffeemakers. Buying supplies for
breakfast will save you money — and probably calories.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for 
discounts on plane tickets and some rooms in international chain
hotels (see Appendix A for a list of international hotel chains in
Rome). Ask about everything — you may be pleasantly surprised
by the answer you receive.
 Get out of the center of town. In Rome, you’ll find that staying in
hotels just outside il centro (the historic center) isn’t quite as con-
venient but is a great bargain. You may need to do only a little more
walking or take a short commute. Don’t overdo it, though: If you
pick a hotel too far out of the way, you’ll waste hours of precious
time in transportation, and you may well ruin your trip. The key is
always to stay only a short commute from the attractions you want
to visit. See Chapter 9 for more hotel information.
 Ask whether your kids can stay in your room with you. Many hotels
won’t charge you the additional-person rate if your extra person is
pint-size and related to you. Even if you have to pay $20 or $30 extra
for a rollaway bed, you’ll save hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. At most top
restaurants, prices at lunch are usually considerably less than those
at dinner, and the menu often offers many of the same specialties.
 Have a picnic. You can put together some delicious and inexpen-
sive meals at a Roman grocery store and then enjoy your feast in 
a garden or park.
 Use public transportation. In Rome, using the local bus system may
be a little complicated at times, but it’s also a great way to see the
city the way locals do.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. If you absolutely need to rent a car to get
yourself out of town, renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you save
on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and need lots of
space, don’t go beyond economy size.
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save you money in taxis
and other local transportation. As a bonus, you’ll get to know your
destination more intimately as you explore at a slower pace. Rome’s
historic center is quite large, but you’ll want to visit it in sections, so
that you can actually walk almost anywhere you need to go for that
part of the day.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories could be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts, key chains, salt-and-pepper shakers,
and other trinkets.

Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying 
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Making sense of the euro
Italy’s currency, the euro (the plural is also euro, and it’s abbreviated as
€ in this guide), was introduced in January 2002 in Italy and in 11 other
European countries. You can use the same currency in Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain.
The transformation to the euro has made things much easier for
Americans, because 1€ exchanges in a range nearer $1 (the exchange rate
used in this book is 1€ = $1.30; we round off all dollar values above $10).
Many Web sites present the latest exchange rates, but one of the best is
www.ex-rates.com, where you can get up-to-date (and historical) com-
parisons between the euro and your currency, whether it is the U.S. or
Canadian dollar, the British pound, or something else. Another excellent
Web site is www.xe.com/ucc. At press time, the British pound exchanged
at 1£ = 1.51€. These were the rates of exchange used to calculate the
values in Table 4-2.

Note that in the word euro, Italians pronounce all three vowels, so it’s 
ay-ur-oh, not yurr-oh.
All did not go smoothly with the transition to the euro from the old lira.
In many cases, Italian businesses, museums, and other attractions set
their prices in euro as an exact equivalent to former prices in lire. The
result was a lot of funny-looking prices like 14.03€, 18.61€, and so on —
and a lot of annoyed Italians searching through fistfuls of change. As they
became more comfortable with the new currency, businesses started
rounding up their prices. At first, this caused a wild increase in prices,
but the Italian government stepped in and demanded that price increases
be justifiable. Now, after a couple of years, the situation is much more
under control. It’s true that a number of prices have increased, but you
also usually get more.
For example, some museum admissions have increased, but the opening
hours have also been extended to be more in line with opening hours in
the rest of Europe and the world. In other cases, prices have decreased
because they’ve been rounded off to the lower whole-euro amount. In
Rome, the Palazzo Altemps admission went from 5.16€ to 5€, for example.
Similarly, some hotel prices have gone up considerably, but more and
more hotels now offer a level of amenities comparable with U.S. hotels.
Of course, from the U.S. standpoint, Italian prices have increased, and
quite a lot. This is due to the loss of value suffered by the U.S. dollar on
international currency markets. For example, although that admission to
Palazzo Altemps we just mentioned went down from 5.16€ in 2003 to 5€
in 2005, in dollars, the price went up from $4.70 to $6, because at press
time, the dollar can buy fewer euro than two years ago. By the time you
read this, the two currencies may be closer to parity, but then again,
maybe not. It’s all the more important, then, to plan ahead and get the
best deals you can.

You can exchange money at the airport in Rome — where you’ll also find
an automated teller machine (ATM), as well as at banks and exchange
bureaus in town. These usually display multilingual signs (CHANGE/CAMBIO/
WECHSEL). Rates may vary to some degree. For example, some bureaus
advertise “no fee” but then give you a lower rate so you come out the
same anyway. Arriving in Rome with a small supply of euro, at least
enough to pay for a cab to your hotel, is a good idea in case the ATM
machine at the airport doesn’t work or the lines are unbearably long.
Nowadays, you don’t even need to go to your bank to buy euro: You 
can get foreign currencies delivered to your door before you leave. The
OANDA Web site (www.oanda.com) provides everything you ever wanted
to know about currency (including the euro’s most recent value against
your own country’s currency). The minimum purchase is $200, and the
maximum is $1,500; shipping is free if you buy over $500, and you’ll proba-
bly want to pay by debit card. (If you pay by credit card, you’re charged
as you would be for a cash advance, with the consequent fees.)
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM.
The Cirrus network (% 800/424-7787; www.mastercard.com) is the
most common international network in Rome. PLUS (% 800/843-7587;
www.visa.com) exists in Rome but is less common. The Banca Nationale
del Lavoro (BNL) is one bank that does offer PLUS in its ATMs; you can
find several BNL branches in Rome.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49
The euro look
Paper bills come in 5€, 10€, 20€, 50€, 100€, 200€, and 500€ denominations. All bills
are brightly colored and have a different shade for each denomination. In addition, the
higher the value, the larger the physical size of the bill. A 50€ bill is bigger than a dollar
bill, and even the smaller denominations are taller than U.S. dollars; if you have a
bunch, you’ll find stuffing them in your wallet a bit difficult. Remember that shops are
always short of change, and breaking those large bills to buy a soft drink is sometimes
difficult. Think ahead, and try to have enough 10€ bills with you as you travel in Italy.
Coins come in 1€ and 2€ (both thin and brass-colored); 10-cent, 20-cent, and 50-cent
(all brass colored); and 1-cent, 2-cent, and 5-cent (all copper-colored) denominations.
For more information and pictures of the currency, check online at the official Web
site of the European Union (http://europa.eu.int/euro) or at the site of the
European Central Bank (www.euro.ecb.int).
Don’t be surprised to see different country names on euro bills and coins: One face is
the European side, common to each of the 12 participating countries, and the reverse
face is the national side, where each country has printed its own design. All are valid
and accepted in each of the countries.

Before leaving for Rome, make sure that you check the daily withdrawal
limit for your ATM card, and ask whether you need a new personal iden-
tification number (PIN). (You need a four-digit PIN for Europe, so if you
currently have a six-digit PIN, you must get a new one before you go.)
Not all ATM keypads in Rome display letters as well as numbers. Some
have only numbers. Therefore, if your PIN is “SPOT,” you need to know
how it translates into numbers. (Check this before you leave home!)
Look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on; then
call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. Be sure to
find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart. Also keep in mind
that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a different
bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international transactions (up
to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (where they’re rarely more than
$1.50). On top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may
charge its own fee. For international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
In Rome, ATMs are never far away, so you can walk around with 100€
($115) in your wallet, and you should be set to dine and pay your museum
admissions (but not your hotel bill). Before going off on a driving tour of
the countryside, however, make sure that you have a good stock of cash
in your wallet; banks and ATMs are rarer outside the big cities, and lots
of small businesses don’t accept credit cards.
If you have linked checking and savings accounts and you’re in the habit
of moving relatively small amounts of money from savings to check-
ing as you need it, beware: Italian ATMs won’t show you the transfer-
between-accounts option, and they won’t allow you to withdraw money
directly from your savings account. If your checking account runs dry,
you must call or write your bank to move money from savings to check-
ing. (We did so, and our bank charged us $30. Ouch!)
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, as long as you know your PIN. If you’ve forgot-
ten yours or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back
of your credit card, and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes
five to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by Visa or
MasterCard or American Express for currency conversion on credit
charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you
factor in things like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check
exchange rates (and service fees).

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 

Some credit-card companies recommend that you notify them of any
upcoming trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit-card company in advance, 
you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card 
with you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons,
so having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because 24-hour ATMs
allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as needed. However, keep
in mind that you’ll likely be charged an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank 
is not your own (in Rome, it won’t be), so if you’re withdrawing money
every day, you might be better off with traveler’s checks — as long as
you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash one.
Traveler’s checks are widely accepted in Rome, especially at large
tourist stores and at hotels.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent. You can
also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800/221-7282; AMEX gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 and 2 per-
cent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000.
Call % 800/732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain Visa
checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866/339-3378.
MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800/223-9920 for a
location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Being on vacation is a blissful time of distraction and discovery.
Unfortunately, this makes a tourist a ripe target for pickpockets. In Italy,
violent crime is rare; most wallets that are stolen are lost to pickpockets,
not muggers.
If you discover that your wallet has been lost or stolen, contact all of
your credit-card companies right away. You’ll also want to file a report 
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 51

at the nearest police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may
require a police-report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card
companies have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost
or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following
emergency numbers in the United States:
 American Express % 800/221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800/307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800/847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free-number directory at % 800-555-
1212.
In Rome, contact these offices:
 American Express (% 06-7220348 or 06-72282 or 06-72461;
www.americanexpress.it)
 Diners Club (% 800-864064866 toll-free within Italy; www.diners
club.com)
 MasterCard (% 800-870866 toll-free within Italy; www.
mastercard.com)
 Visa (% 800-819014 toll-free within Italy; www.visaeu.com)
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft or fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license or passport along with your
cash and credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immedi-
ately; placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liabil-
ity for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your 
airline, and explain the situation; it may allow you to board the plane if
you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you’ve filed.
Watch your purse, wallet, briefcase, or backpack in any public place.
And when walking on the streets, keep your purse on the side away from
traffic, so a thief on a motor scooter can’t speed by and grab it from you.
Better yet, carry your money, credit cards, and passport in an interior
pocket, where pickpockets won’t be able to snatch them.

Getting to Rome

A
lthough most visitors fly to Rome, you could also arrive by train or
by ship. Technically, you could even drive from another European
city, although we don’t recommend it. This chapter outlines your
options for getting to Rome as effortlessly as possible.
Flying to Rome
Rome is one of the only two Italian cities to which you can fly nonstop
from North America — Milan is the other one. If you live near a major
airport, flying to Rome may be even easier than reaching another desti-
nation in your own country — but it won’t be cheaper. Airfares to Rome
are significantly higher than those from the United States to London, for
example, and a round-trip ticket during peak times can run between $800
and $1,200. Of course, with the cutthroat competition among airlines,
you may be able to lock in a much better deal — especially if you book
well in advance and have a flexible itinerary.
Finding out which airlines fly there
Alitalia (% 800/223-5730 in the United States; 800/361-8336 in Canada;
020/7602-7111 in London or 0990/448-259 in the rest of the United King-
dom; 1300/653-747 or 1300/653-757 in Australia; toll-free 1478-65643 or
06-65643 in Italy; www.alitalia.it), the Italian national airline, offers
direct or one-stop flights to Rome from most major cities in the world.
Alitalia also offers daily flights to all European capitals. Direct daily flights
are scheduled from a number of U.S. cities, as well as Toronto and
Montréal. Likewise, Alitalia offers direct service between Sydney and
Italy, but not every day.

Among the U.S. airlines, American Airlines (% 800/433-7300; www.
aa.com), Delta (% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com), United (% 800/
538-2929; www.united.com), US Airways (% 800/428-4322; www.us
airways.com), Continental (% 800/525-0280; www.continental.com),
and Northwest/KLM Airlines (% 800-447-4747; www.nwa.com) all usually
offer direct nonstop flights to Rome or Milan from the United States, at
least during peak season.
From Britain, your best bet is British Airways (% 0845/773-3377 in the
United Kingdom; www.britishairways.com), though smaller charter
companies also offer flights. Alitalia (% 020/8745-8200 in the United
Kingdom; www.alitalia.it) is another possibility. Innovative options
include Ryanair (% 0871/246-0000; www.ryanair.com) and EasyJet
(www.easyjet.com), which fit the old no-frills or discount airline slot.
From Australia and New Zealand, there is Alitalia (% 02/9922-1555 
in Australia and New Zealand; www.alitalia.it). Cathay Pacific
(% 1-300/361-060 in Australia; 0800/800-454 in New Zealand; www.
cathaypacific.com) offers three flights a week to Rome from Melbourne
and Sydney, connecting through Hong Kong. The airline also offers two
flights from Perth and Cairns, connecting through Hong Kong, and one
flight from Brisbane, connecting through Hong Kong. Auckland is also
served thrice weekly, also with a connection through Hong Kong.
Another option is Qantas (% 13-13-13; www.qantas.com), which offers
some direct flights — daily from Melbourne to Rome and several days 
a week from Sydney. Air New Zealand (% 0800/737-000; www.airnz.
com) doesn’t fly directly to Italy. You have to change in another
European city to a national carrier.
On any day of the week, you can get a connecting flight through a major
European capital, where you switch to the national carrier — for exam-
ple, connecting through London with British Airways or through Paris
with Air France. European airlines include British Airways (% 800/
247-297; www.britishairways.com), Air France (% 800/237-2747;
www.airfrance.com), KLM (% 800/374-7747; www.klm.nl), and
Lufthansa (% 800/645-3880; www.lufthansa-usa.com).
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that in any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the 
last minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
54

price — usually a fraction of the full fare. For example, a flight from New
York to Rome on two days’ notice is a gruesome $3,000. But make it a
seven-day advance-purchase ticket, and the price immediately drops to
$1,100. Make it 14-day advance-purchase, and it drops further, and so on.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As
you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend
to take place in seasons of low travel volume — for Rome, that means
the dead of winter. You almost never see a sale for travel from around
mid-May through the peak summer vacation months of July and August
and into September for Rome; you also pay top dollar at Thanksgiving
and Christmas, when many people fly regardless of the fare they have 
to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excel-
lent fares worldwide. Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 coun-
tries. FlyCheap, an industry leader, has become Lowestfare.com (www.
lowestfare.com) and is owned by Priceline (see later in this chapter).
Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is
based in Montréal and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for
low fares. The TravelHub (% 888-AIR-FARE; www.travelhub.com) rep-
resents nearly 1,000 travel agencies, many of which offer consolidator
and discount fares.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) —
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available 
to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel-agency Web sites,
Chapter 5: Getting to Rome 55

SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s 
a browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once” but in real-
ity beats competitors’ fares only as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are valid 
for travel only that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites, or check
megasites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials, 
such as Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com). For last-minute
trips, www.site59.com in the United States and www.lastminute.com
in Europe often have better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent hither and yon
before you arrive in Italy is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m.
or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. For example, Hotwire has a “no red-eye”
option, but be aware that it thinks that a 6 a.m. flight for which you have
to be at the airport two hours in advance (it’s hardly worth putting on
your jammies, is it?) is not a red-eye. Hotwire tells you flight prices
before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you
have to play its “name our price” game — and with each try, you have 
to change something besides your bid, which is to prevent people from
making endless iterations starting at 20 bucks. If you have fixed travel
dates, better make a realistic bid to start, or you’ll have to change them
or look elsewhere. In order to cover all the bases, Priceline now owns
Lowestfare.com (www.lowestfare.com), on which you don’t have to
bid for seats.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. 
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.
Keep in mind that European national airlines (Alitalia, Lufthansa, Air
France, and so on) may cost more, but they also seem to have more
legroom and better service. This may be an important consideration,
given that the flight from New York to Rome is about eight hours, com-
pared with five hours to London.

Arriving by Other Means
You may be adding Rome to a larger European vacation, or perhaps 
you live in Britain or Ireland (if you are in Britain and are tempted to
drive your own car to Rome, don’t — we did it once, and it was long and
exhausting). Flying to Rome and renting a car there — or skipping the
car altogether — will be cheaper. So you may be looking for other ways
to get to Rome. If so, check out the following list of alternative ways to
get to Italy.
Train
Paris is connected to Italy by high-speed TGV trains to Torino–Novara–
Milan. From Paris, you can also take the famous Palatino, the overnight
train to Rome. You can also catch overnight trains from Germany
(Hanover, Düsseldorf, Köln, Bonn, and Frankfurt). International trains
usually arrive at Stazione Termini, in the heart of Rome. Contact
Trenitalia (% 892021 from anywhere in Italy; www.trenitalia.it), 
the Italian railroad company, for fares and information.
Ship and ferry
Cruise ships and ferries headed for Rome land at the harbor of
Civitavecchia, about one hour north of Rome and easily connected by
very frequent train and bus service, as well as car service. A number 
of ferry companies service Civitavecchia from several countries in the
Mediterranean.
Bus
Eurolines (% 0990/143-219; www.eurolines.com) is the leading opera-
tor of scheduled coach services across Europe, and it offers service from
London’s Victoria Coach Station to Rome.
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours: The tour
company takes care of all the details; it tells you what to expect at each
leg of your journey. You know your costs up front, and you don’t get
many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to take an escorted tour, we strongly recommend buying
travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay up front.
Buying travel insurance through an independent agency is wise (more
about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7).
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
Chapter 5: Getting to Rome 57

 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel 
the trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the tour
operator cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Do tour organizers try to fit 25
hours into a 24-hour day, or is there ample time for relaxing and/
or shopping? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not returning to
your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain escorted
tours may not be for you.
 How big is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size, and operators may cancel the tour if they don’t book
enough people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close
the tour is to reaching it.
 What is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to pay to
get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be included
in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. How much flexibility do
you have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does the bus
leave once a day, with no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in
advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody
get the same chicken cutlet?
Most companies specializing in escorted tours for Italy include Rome 
as part of a larger tour. Escorted tours focusing exclusively on Rome are
more difficult to find, and most companies offer packages (see the fol-
lowing section), with the possibility of adding specific guided excursions
of your choice. Here are a few of the best Italian operators (prices quoted
include airfare except as noted; remember that packages and prices
change all the time):
 Italiatour (www.italiatour.com), a company associated with
Alitalia, offers great flexibility and native expertise. It maintains
information offices in most countries, and you can contact it in 
the United States (% 800/845-3365 or 212/675-2183; www.italia
tourusa.com), as well as in the United Kingdom (% 1883-623363;
www.italiatour.co.uk), in Canada (% 905/673-3623; www.
cittours-canada.com), and in Australia (Concorde Leisure, 
% 3-99203825; www.italiatour.com.au). Italiatour always has
great packages for Rome, to which you can add guided tours and
excursions of your choice from a large menu. The prices are always
competitive, and all excursions and guided tours are priced 10 to
30 percent less than what you could do if you booked directly on
your own.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
58

 Perillo Tours (577 Chestnut Ridge Rd., Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07675-
9888; % 800/431-1515 or 201-307-1234; www.perillotours.com)
has been in business for more than half a century. It also offers
packages to which you can add guided tours and excursions of 
the Eternal City.
 Central Holidays (% 800/935-5000; www.centralholidays.com)
offers fully escorted tours in addition to its packages. Several levels
of tours — and levels of “escort” — are offered. “Romantic Rome,” a
six-night tour, is priced between $891 (in Nov) and $1,697 (in spring
and early Sept).
Choosing a Package Tour
For Rome, package tours are definitely a smart way to go. In many cases,
a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to and
from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book your-
self. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, which
resell them to the public.
Package tours can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels than
others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book
flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In some packages,
your choice of accommodations and travel days may be limited. Some
let you choose between escorted vacations and independent vacations;
others allow you to add on just a few excursions or escorted day trips
(also at discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
Remember that the escorted tour operators discussed earlier also offer
packages. Italiatour is one of the best, offering packages with your choice
of guided tours and excursions that you can tailor to your specific needs
and interests, with accommodations at a discounted rate. Some of its
tours offer very competitive prices: In the late spring season, you can
get a five-night Rome package for $1,199, including airfare. The afore-
mentioned Perillo Tours and Central Holidays also have good packages
for Rome. (See the preceding section for contact information for all three
tour companies.) Another recommended packager is Kemwell (% 800-
678-0678; www.kemwell.com).
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800/321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800/221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800/301-3800; www.coolvacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888/854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com).
If you search for a package on an airline Web site, be prepared to 
spend a long time playing around with the variables. A dozen or more
outbound- and return-flight options may pop up, each of which will
affect the price. Your selected departure city matters, too. At the
Chapter 5: Getting to Rome 59

American Airlines Vacations site, we came up with a whopping $5,822 
for a five-day air/hotel package to Florence in July, flying from Boston.
Change the departure airport to New York’s JFK, and the price for the
same trip plummets to $2,081. This is not unique to American; with 
any of these airline sites, you need to do a lot fiddling to get the best
price. And always look first for the specials and last-minute deals they’re
running.
The travel section of your local Sunday newspaper or the ads in the
back of travel magazines such as Travel + Leisure, National Geographic
Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler are also a good source of information
on packagers. Liberty Travel (% 888/271-1584; www.libertytravel.
com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast and usually has a
full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59,
and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re
unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better
Business Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go to www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with that
company.

E
very traveler is a special traveler, but bringing kids along on your
trip to Rome, traveling alone as a single woman, or trying to find
wheelchair-accessible accommodations and attractions all require extra
care and thought. Seniors may be interested in special programs and
activities; gays and lesbians may wonder how friendly and welcoming
Rome will be. We consider all these issues in this chapter.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the morn-
ing, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an insurmount-
able challenge. But family travel can be immensely rewarding, allowing
you to see the world in new ways, through smaller pairs of eyes.
Families with kids can have a great time in Rome. It helps if you talk 
to your kids before the trip, preparing them for special things in store
for them. Involve your children in planning for the trip. Go over the list
of sights and activities in the areas that you plan to visit, particularly
noting those labeled with the Kid Friendly icon in this book. Let your
kids make their own list of things they want to do. Encourage older chil-
dren to research Rome on the Internet (see Appendix A for a list of Web
sites worth checking out).
Romans are very family oriented, and Romans of all age love children,
which makes traveling here with your kids much easier. People rarely
get annoyed at children, and you’ll find that people will often talk to or
inquire about your child(ren) in stores and restaurants or even as you

walk in the street. Romans love their children so much that they can
hardly imagine leaving their children behind, and they bring them along
nearly everywhere. So although businesses and service providers are
used to dealing with children and ready to meet their basic needs, few
businesses cater especially to families with kids in ways that you might
be used to in the United States.
Basically all restaurants provide high chairs and mezza porzione (half-
portions) and are ready to prepare a simple dish (spaghetti with plain
tomato sauce, for example) even if it isn’t on the menu. Also, all hotels
will add to your room a crib or a small child bed, often for free, and most
will have triples and sometimes quads available for families with older
children; at a minimum, they’ll have adjoining rooms with a communicat-
ing door to turn your hotel room into a suite. However, only rarely will
you find special children’s menus in restaurants — Italian children usu-
ally eat what their parents eat — and you’ll find even less often special
kids’ treats such as crayons and paper. Similarly, you’ll almost never see
a child-care or play area at museums, and hotels don’t provide nurseries
or a playroom for day-care service. Hotels in the more expensive cate-
gories offer babysitting on request and call in professional baby sitters
from a reputable agency, but they rarely offer a children’s program or
structured activities for your kids (see Appendix A for details on
babysitting services).
What this all boils down to is that Italians in general expect children 
to be well behaved (act politely like little adults in museums and other
public places) and parents to know how to keep them happy. When
tantrums, whining, and other outbursts occur, Romans frown upon the
parent(s), not the child, whom Romans look at understandingly with a
smile, as if to ask, “What is this mother or father of yours putting you
through, poor thing?” Be prepared for a lot of well-meaning interference
when your child misbehaves.
Fortunately, several organizations exist whose aim is to make traveling
with the brood an enjoyable experience. One of the best, Familyhostel
(% 800-733-9753; www.learn.unh.edu/familyhostel), takes the whole
family, including kids ages 8 to 15, on moderately priced domestic and
international learning vacations. Lectures, field trips, and sightseeing are
guided by a team of academics.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a 
comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that
offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally with
Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site that
offers customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.thefamily

off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.

How to Take Great Trips with Your Kids (The Harvard Common Press)
is full of good general advice that can apply to travel anywhere. Family
Travel Times, another good resource, is published six times a year 
(% 888/822-4FTT or 212/477-5524; www.familytraveltimes.com) and
includes a weekly call-in service for subscribers. Subscriptions are $39
per year for quarterly editions.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
In general, Romans accord older people a great deal of respect, probably
because of the Roman embrace of extended family as well as the culture
and nature of the Italian language (polite forms of address are to be used
when speaking with someone older than yourself). Therefore, you’re
unlikely to encounter ageism.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888/687-2277
or 202/434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on international chain
hotels, airfares, and car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of
benefits, including AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter.
Anyone over 50 can join.
Being a senior entitles you to some terrific travel bargains. Many reliable
agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market and offer trips to
Rome. Elderhostel (% 877/426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges
study programs for those age 55 and over (and a spouse or companion
of any age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries around
the world. Most courses last five to seven days in the United States (two
to four weeks abroad), and many include airfare, accommodations in
university dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition. ElderTreks
(% 800/741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group tours to
off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations, restricted to travelers
50 and older.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800/221-2610 or 617/350-7500;

Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely
Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50 (McGraw-Hill).
Senior discounts on admission at theaters, museums, and public trans-
portation are subject to reciprocity between countries. Because the
United States hasn’t signed the bilateral agreement (you discount us,
and we’ll discount you), Americans aren’t eligible for senior discounts 
in Italy. (The same rule applies to the under-17 discount.) All discounts
apply to citizens of European Union countries.

Accessing Rome: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anybody from traveling, and more options
and resources are available than ever before. Rome is working to make
its treasures more accessible, but it’s a slow process.
Although Italy may not be as advanced as some other countries in its
accessibility, Rome, as the country’s capital, is more in step with the
times than other destinations in Italy. But keep in mind that the age of
the housing stock and the difficulty of retrofitting medieval buildings
with elevators or ramps pose serious limits to accessibility. Some of the
major buildings and institutions have been converted; others have not
or cannot. Calling ahead is always best, especially because, although
special entrances may exist for the disabled, you may need to arrange 
to have an attendant meet you there. Public transportation reserves
spaces for the disabled, and the Roman transportation authority has
recently introduced new kneeling busses that make getting in and out
quite easy. Some train stations and bus lines, though, can prove difficult,
even impossible, if you’re in a wheelchair.
You can avoid some of these problems by joining a tour that caters specif-
ically to your needs. Many travel agencies offer customized tours and
itineraries for travelers with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507/
451-5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and
cruises that emphasize sports and private tours in minivans with lifts.
Access-Able Travel Source (% 303/232-2979; www.access-able.com)
offers extensive access information and advice for traveling around the
world with disabilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800/846-4537 or 610/
521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com) caters to wheelchair travelers
and their families and friends.
Avis Rent a Car’s “Avis Access” program offers such services as a dedi-
cated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888/879-4273) for customers with
special travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spinner
knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include Moss
Rehab Hospital (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a 
library of accessible-travel resources online; and SATH, the Society for
Accessible Travel and Hospitality (% 212/447-7284; www.sath.org;
annual membership fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which
offers a wealth of travel resources for all types of disabilities and
informed recommendations on destinations, access guides, travel
agents, tour operators, vehicle rentals, and companion services. The
American Foundation for the Blind (% 800/232-5463; www.afb.org)

Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Rome is a very tolerant city in a fairly tolerant country, and violent dis-
plays of intolerance such as gay bashing are quite unheard of. However,
as in the United States, an active gay and lesbian movement is trying to
raise public consciousness about prejudice and discrimination.
Rome has an active gay life, and you can check out the local branch of
ARCI-Gay/ARCI-Lesbica (www.arcigay.it/roma), the country’s leading
gay organization. Its Web site has an English-language version. The Eternal
City can boast of having held the first-ever World Pride event in Italy in
July 2000, to coincide with the Jubilee celebrations. During the summer, in
parallel with the Estate Romana festival, a whole neighborhood of Rome
turns into Gay Village (www.gayvillage.it), a town within the town,
where tolerance is the leitmotif and gay and straight mingle while enjoy-
ing a variety of cultural events (see Chapters 15 and 16).
The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) (% 800/
448-8550 or 954/776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for

E
ven if you have a destination, an itinerary, and a ticket in hand, you
aren’t going anywhere until you get a passport. You also need to
figure out whether you need a rental car, whether to get traveler’s insur-
ance, and how you want to stay in touch with the folks back home. In
this chapter, we help you tie up all the loose ends.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting 
a passport is easy, but the process takes some time. For an up-to-date,
country-by-country listing of passport requirements around the 
world, visit the Foreign Entry Requirement Web page of the U.S. State
Department at http://travel.state.gov/foreignentryreqs.html.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State
Department Web site (http://travel.state.gov) or call the
National Passport Information Center (% 202/647-0518).

2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social
Security card is also a good idea.
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2 x 2 inches.
You often find businesses that take these photos near a passport
office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine
because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee.
For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years and costs
$85. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five years and
costs $70.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $55. Whether you’re applying in person
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State
Department Web site at http://travel.state.gov. For general infor-
mation, call the National Passport Agency (% 202/647-0518). To find
your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State Department
Web site or call the National Passport Information Center toll-free
number (% 877/487-2778) for automated information.
Losing your passport may be worse than losing your money. Why?
Because a passport shows (and proves to authorities) that you are you.
Safeguard your passport in an inconspicuous, inaccessible place like a
money belt. Always carry a photocopy of your passport with you, and
keep it in a separate pocket or purse. If you lose your passport, visit 
the nearest consulate of your native country as soon as possible for a
replacement.
Applying for other passports
Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131/232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how 
and where to apply.
Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada; at post offices; or from the central Passport Office, Depart-
ment of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3
(% 800/567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be accompanied
by two identical passport-size photographs and proof of Canadian citi-
zenship. Processing takes five to ten days if you apply in person or
about three weeks by mail.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New Zealand
Passports Office or download it from the agency’s Web site. Contact the
Passports Office at % 0800/225-050 in New Zealand or 04-474-8100, or
log on to www.passports.govt.nz for more information.
United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard 
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at pass-
port offices, major post offices, or a travel agency. For information, 
contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870/521-0410;
www.ukpa.gov.uk).
When you get your passport photos taken, ask for six to eight total
photos if you’re planning to also apply for an International Driving
Permit and an international student or teacher ID, which may entitle 
you to discounts at museums. Take the extra photos with you. You may
need one for random reasons on the road, and if — heaven forbid — you
ever lose your passport, you can use them for a replacement request.
Renting a Car — Not!
To start with, nonresidents are not allowed to drive within the city
center — basically within the city walls. You can’t even drive in the for-
bidden area just to drop your luggage at your hotel. If you arrive by car,
you must either get a hotel outside the city center or park your car out-
side the city walls and take a taxi to your hotel.
Even if you were allowed to drive in Rome, we would still strongly discour-
age you from doing so. Rome’s streets are notoriously congested. The
Roman way to deal with the nightmarish traffic situation is to ride mopeds
and motorscooters, and thousands of them seem to swarm at every inter-
section. Because of the snarl of cars and mopeds, crossing the street on
foot is a dangerous enough activity — and driving is almost suicidal!
Making matters worse, secure parking garages are few and far between —
and expensive! (about 30€/$39 per day) — and you certainly don’t want
to park in the street, where your car can be broken into. Factor in the high
cost of fuel (about 5€/$6.50 a gallon), and you see why it’s best to leave
the driving to someone else. See Chapter 8 for details on transportation
within the city.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, but expect to pay between 5 and 8 percent of the
vacation itself. Here is our advice on all three:

goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can range from
sickness to natural disasters to the State Department’s declaring
your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t cover
vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried to
cancel their trips in October 2001 because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back
on goods and services not received if they report the loss within 
60 days after the charge is listed on their credit-card statement.
Note: Some experts suggest that you avoid buying insurance from
the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s better
to buy from a third-party insurer than to put all your money in one
place.
 For travel overseas, most health plans (including Medicare and
Medicaid) do not provide medical insurance coverage, and the ones
that do often require you to pay for services up front and reimburse
you only after you return home. Even if your plan does cover over-
seas treatment, most out-of-country hospitals make you pay your
bills up front and send you a refund only after you’ve returned home
and filed the necessary paperwork with your insurance company.
As a safety net, you may want to buy travel medical insurance. If
you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance
(% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; for
general information on services, call the company’s Worldwide
Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up
to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
more valuable than the standard liability, see whether your valu-
ables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage insur-
ance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or
buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at the
airport — it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, because
many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.

Staying Healthy When You Travel
For travel abroad, you may have to pay all medical costs up front and be
reimbursed by your health-care plan later. For information on purchas-
ing additional medical insurance for your trip, see the previous section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888/633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance 
to Travelers (IAMAT) (% 716/754-4883 or, in Canada, 416/652-0137;
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, as well as lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800/311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety.
If you do get sick in Rome, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend
a local doctor — even his or her own doctor, if necessary. If you can’t
locate a doctor, try contacting your embassy or consulate — they main-
tain lists of English-speaking doctors. In an emergency, dial % 113 for
the police or % 112 for the Carabinieri (army police corps): They can
call an ambulance and help you in many other ways. If your situation 
is life threatening, call % 118 for immediate medical help such as an
ambulance or even a helicopter ambulance if needed. If you can move

Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis or, as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and
stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventive
measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and
avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills.

by your own means and are not far from a hospital, get yourself to the
pronto soccorso (emergency department) at the nearest hospital (check
Appendix A for addresses).
Under the Italian national health-care system, you’re eligible only for free
emergency care. If you’re admitted to a hospital as an inpatient, even
from an accident and through an emergency department, you’re required
to pay (unless you’re a resident of the European Economic Area). You’re
also required to pay for follow-up care. For the names, addresses, and
phone numbers of hospitals offering 24-hour emergency care, see the
“Fast Facts” section in Appendix A.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
If you’re from Europe, you’re lucky: Your phone already works in Rome.
If you’re from another continent, things are a little complicated.
Using a cellphone outside the United States
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes
for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens of
other countries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile and Cingular
use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and some Rogers
customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across civilized areas on much
of the globe. Just call your wireless operator, and ask for “international
roaming” to be activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute
charges can be high — usually $1 to $1.50 in Western Europe.
For many, renting a phone is the way to go. In Rome, you don’t have 
to look for a place to rent a phone; you can make the phone come to
you. Rentacell (% 877-736-8355 in the U.S.; 02-86337799 in Italy; www.
rentacell.com) will deliver a phone to you anywhere for free. You can
also pick it up in the United States before you leave. The kit rental is 
8€ ($10) per day (less for longer periods), and incoming calls are free,
while outgoing calls range from .76€ (98¢) within Italy to 1.22€ ($1.60) to
other countries, including the United States. If you need only a SimCard
(the chip to put in your own phone), the rental is free, and you pay only
for outgoing calls. Easyline (% 800-010600 in Italy) also delivers
phones for free and applies similar charges.
Accessing the Internet away from home
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a 
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71

personal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you
can still access your e-mail from Rome. Your hotel is most likely to have
an Internet point free for its guests or even to offer full Internet access
in your room through a multimedia TV.
Rome also has a great number of cybercafes. Although there’s no defini-
tive directory of cybercafes — these are independent businesses, after
all — two places to start looking are www.cybercaptive.com and www.
cybercafe.com. Easy Everything (www.easyeverything.com), a global
Internet-cafe company, currently has two franchises in Rome, but the
company is rapidly expanding, and by the time you read this, there may
well be more — check the Web site for other locations. Internet Train
(www.internettrain.it), another franchise, already has multiple sites
in Rome.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it 
has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your
ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web serv-
ice (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For
more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account
with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more and
more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless “hotspots”
from where you can get high-speed connection without cable wires, net-
working hardware, or a phone line. You can get a Wi-Fi connection in one
of several ways. Many laptops sold in the past year have built-in Wi-Fi
capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have
their own networking technology: Apple AirPort. If you have an older
computer, you can buy an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) and plug it
into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and coffee
shops, primarily in the United States (followed by the U.K. and Japan). 
T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wireless
connections in many hotel lobbies and other points in Rome. Boingo
(www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set up net-
works in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass providers also give
you access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. Best of all, you
don’t need to be staying at the hotel to use its network; just set yourself
up on a nice couch in the lobby. The companies’ pricing policies can be
byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connection, and per-minute
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
72

plans, but in general, you pay around $30 a month for limited access —
and as more and more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon,
prices are likely to get even more competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the United States and Europe now offer free high-
speed Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring
your own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your
hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
allowing you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s
Web site, or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home and how much it will cost. If you’re travel-
ing outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up numbers
in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass
provider, which will then tell you how to set up your computer for your
destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com, and
click Individual Purchase. One solid provider is i2roam (www.i2roam.
com; % 866/811-6209 or 920/235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit for Italy, including a phone-plug
adapter, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests. For information on
the electric current in Rome, see the “Fast Facts” section in Appendix A.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee, and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. If you have an 
E-ticket, you can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 73

kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring
the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card.
Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk, and simply proceed to the
security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking
bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you’ll be able to do so using
most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the kiosk
system, but always call your airline to make sure these alternatives are
available. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines, although
a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. The general rule is that nail clippers and small scissors and tools,
are okay, and food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray
machine — but that security screeners can’t make you drink from 
your coffee cup. Bring food in your carry-on bag instead of checking it,
because explosive-detection machines used on checked luggage have
been known to mistake food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for
bombs. Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag plus
a “personal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on
hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has 
a laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; 
check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. Travel Sentry certified locks (available at luggage 
and travel shops, as well as at Brookstone stores or online at www.
brookstone.com) are approved by the TSA and can be opened by
inspectors with a special code or key. If you use something other than
TSA-approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a hand-
search is required.

Oriented
In This Chapter
 Arriving in Rome
 Acquainting yourself with the neighborhoods
 Finding information after you arrive
 Getting from place to place
A
rriving in a foreign city is always a challenge, and although Rome
isn’t one of the largest cities in the world, it is large enough to be
confusing; the narrow and winding streets of il centro storico (the his-
toric center) are a maze even for Romans! In this chapter, we give you 
all the information you need to negotiate the Eternal City like a native.
Navigating Your Way through 
Passport Control and Customs
To enter Italy, you need a passport. Because Italy is now part of the group
of European countries that have unified their passport and Customs pro-
cedures (under the Schengen agreement), your passport is checked as
soon as you enter European or Italian territory, whichever comes first. If
you’ve already landed in a European country that is part of the Schengen
area, chances are that you won’t need to show your passport again —
only spot checks are performed at the Italian border. If Rome is your first
port of call in Europe, you’ll have to line up for passport control; often,
you’ll find two lines, one for European Union citizens and one for every-
one else. If everything is okay with your passport, you’ll be allowed in —
but don’t expect your passport to be stamped.
While you’re in Italy, you’re required to have your passport with you at
all times, and you can be asked to produce it at any time to prove your
identity and your legal status. All hotels will ask to see your passport
when you check in. Carry your passport in a safe place on your person

(such as a document pouch worn under your clothes), or leave the origi-
nal in the safe at your hotel and carry a photocopy.
After having your passport checked and collecting your luggage, you
must pass through Customs. Items for personal use enter duty free up 
to 175€ ($228) for each adult and 90€ ($117) for each child under 15. 
In addition, adults can import a maximum of 200 cigarettes (50 cigars), 
1 liter (slightly more that 1 quart) of liquor or 2 liters of wine, 50 grams
of perfume, 500 grams (1 pound) of coffee, and 100 grams (3 ounces) of
tea; children are allowed only perfume. Also, you cannot bring currency
in excess of 10,329€ (at press time $13,428, though the dollar amount
will depend on the conversion rate on the day you travel). See Chapter
12 for Customs regulations regarding what you can bring home. You 
can find more-detailed information at the Italian Customs Web site
(www.agenziadogane.it).
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
It’s still true that “all roads lead to Rome,” but nowadays, so do all planes,
trains, coaches, and even ferries.
Arriving by plane
Rome’s main airport, Leonardo da Vinci, is located in Fiumicino, and
this is where you’re likely to land if you come by plane. However, charter
flights and some European companies also arrive in the smaller airport
of Ciampino.
If you arrive at Fiumicino airport
Though officially named after Leonardo, everybody refers to this airport
as Fiumicino (% 06-65951; www.adr.it), after the name of the nearby
town. The airport is compact and very well organized (but ever expand-
ing), with three terminals connected by a long corridor: Terminal A 
handles domestic travel; Terminal B handles domestic and Schengen
European Community flights (that is, internal flights to the countries 
of the European Community that have signed a special agreement to
waive Customs controls); and Terminal C manages all other international
flights. If you’re flying direct from a U.S. airport, Terminal C is your likely
point of entry. Terminal C is connected to a newer set of gates by a cool
monorail.
While at the airport, you may notice the high level of security. Don’t 
be concerned if you see police officers with submachine guns walking
around — due to recent world tensions, it’s now routine procedure and
one you should be glad of.
Be aware that the security forces at Fiumicino have terrorists in mind, not
common thieves — that means you still have to watch your belongings
like a hawk, and don’t leave anything precious in your checked luggage.
Part III: Settling into Rome 
78

After exiting passport control and Customs, you enter the main con-
course, a long hall that connects all three terminals. There, you’ll find
ATMs (one per terminal), as well as 24-hour currency exchange machines
and a cambio (change) office, open from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and located
just outside Customs in the international arrivals area.
If you’re using traveler’s checks, you may want to change them at the
cambio office — its rates are usually the best in town.
On your way out to ground transportation, you find a very good tourist
information desk (% 06-65956074) providing information on Rome at
one end and on the rest of Italy at the other. Nearby is a help desk for
last-minute hotel reservations — the service, however, doesn’t cover 
all hotels in Rome.
Public transportation, including taxis and car-rental shuttle buses, is just
outside along the sidewalk; the train station is on the second floor of a
building attached to the international terminal.
Fiumicino lies about 30km (18 miles) from Rome and is well connected
by highway, train, shuttle, and bus.
The easiest way to get to your hotel is by taking a taxi. The line forms 
on the curb just outside the terminals and is marked by a sign; taxis are
white and have a meter. For three adult passengers — sometimes, taxis
accept four — expect to pay about 45€ ($58) for the 50-minute ride (well
over an hour at rush hour), plus a luggage fee of 1€ ($1.30) per item for
everything that goes in the trunk, so keep your purse or any small bags
with you inside the car. Expect a night surcharge (10 p.m.–6 a.m.) of
2.60€ ($3.40) and a Sunday and holiday surcharge of 1€ ($1.30).
Although they have almost disappeared, beware of gypsy cab drivers
who approach you as you exit the arrival gate. They don’t have meters
and charge you a lot more than the regulated cab rates.
Taking the train-shuttle into Rome is equally simple — and a lot faster
during rush hour. If you have a lot of luggage, you can hire help at the
baggage-claim area for 2€ ($2.60) per item; they’ll take your bags to the
train. The railroad terminal is connected to the air terminal through a
corridor on the second floor, just outside arrivals (follow the sign marked
TRENI). The best train is the Leonardo Express, a 35-minute shuttle ride
to Termini (Rome’s central rail station), which runs daily every 30 min-
utes from 6:37 a.m. to 11:37 p.m. and costs 9.50€ ($12). There also is a
cheaper local commuter train (look for trains with final destination Orte
or Fara Sabina), which makes various stops along the way and within
Rome but doesn’t stop at Termini. It takes about 40 minutes, depending
on your stop, and runs every 15 minutes Monday through Saturday 
and every 30 minutes on Sunday for about 5€ ($6.50). Get off at Roma
Ostiense if your hotel is in the area of the Aventino or the Colosseum;
Roma Trastevere if it is in the area of Trastevere, San Pietro, or Prati;
and at Roma Tiburtina if your hotel is in the Porta Pia or Villa Borghese
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 79

area. Tickets for both trains are sold at the ticket booth in the terminal.
Remember to stamp your ticket at one of the small yellow validation
boxes before you board the train.
If you’re planning to use public transportation in Rome, consider buy-
ing a day pass or a tourist three-day ticket (see “Getting Around Rome,”
later in this chapter) at the tobacconist in the railroad terminal. Definitely
do so if you’re planning to use the commuter train from the airport to
Rome, because the ride is included in either of those passes (only for
the regular commuter train, though, not for the Leonardo Express).
Whichever train you take, a taxi stand is located immediately outside
the train stations upon your arrival. You can also take public transpor-
tation. Ranks of buses, with signs indicating their numbers and routes,
stop in the area in front of the train station; the subway is underneath
the station.
Finally, you can take a bus shuttle into Rome. Terravision (% 06-
79494572; www.terravision.it) runs a shuttle to Termini station and
to Tiburtina station, with stops at a few major hotels for 9€ ($12) and 
5€ ($6.50) for children ages 2 to 12.
Note: We do not recommend renting a car at the airport and driving it
into Rome. See Chapter 7 for additional information.
If you arrive at Ciampino airport
A number of international charter flights and some companies that mainly
serve Europe arrive at Ciampino (% 06-794941 or 06-79340297), 16km
(10 miles) from the center of Rome. This airport has few structures or
services; it’s almost like an American civil-aviation airport.
Taxis are by far the easiest way to get to town from Ciampino. Expect to
pay about 35€ ($45) for the 45-minute trip. You can also take a shuttle
bus; Terravision (% 06-79494572. www.terravision.it) runs a shut-
tle service in concert with Ryanair flights, and Schiaffini runs a shuttle
coinciding with EasyJet flights. Both take you to Termini station for 
8€ ($10); tickets are sold at the Hotel Royal Santina or at the Hotel
Stromboli on Via Marsala, just across from the Termini train station.
Arriving by ship
If you’re coming by sea, your ocean liner will dock in the harbor of
Civitavecchia (about 80 km/50 miles north of Rome). There, you can
catch one of the frequent coaches and trains for Rome arriving at
Termini station or Tiburtina station. Trains leave every about 20 minutes
for the hourlong ride to Rome, with direct coaches departing every hour.
You can call a taxi from either the harbor or the train station, dialing 
% 0766-26121 or 0766 24251 should none be available at the taxi stand.
You can also arrange for limousine service from the harbor. The best 
Part III: Settling into Rome 
80

no-frills service is Rome Shuttle Limousine (% 348-5141804 or 06-
61969084; www.romeshuttlelimousine.com); it offers a Civitavecchia-
to-Rome transfer for 110€ ($143) for a maximum of four people. Also
good, Best Limos in Rome (% 338-4289389; www.bestlimosinrome.
com) is an English-speaking company based in Rome and specializing on
seaport services. Another good company is Romalimo (% 800-999669
or 06-5414663; www.romalimo.com).
Arriving by train
Rome is a major railroad hub, offering service to every domestic and
international destination. Italy’s Trenitalia train service (% 892021;
www.trenitalia.it) is excellent: cheap, reliable, and frequent. No
fewer than six railway stations are located in the center of Rome, but 
the central and largest is Termini (% 800/431784), the second-busiest
is Tiburtina. Trains usually stop at one or the other.
After you get off the train at Termini station, make your way to the main
concourse by exits located near platforms 1 and 22. The concourse is a
long commercial gallery with a bar at the north end and a pharmacy at
the south end; in between are many newsstands, a tobacconist, a travel
agency, ATMs, and a cambio office, as well as information booths. You
can exit to the street at either end of the gallery, although if you plan to
catch a taxi, take the north exit, where you find a small taxi stand. From
the gallery, you can go one floor below to the lower concourse, a mall
complete with a large bookstore, supermarket, cosmetics store, shoe-
repair shop, and ATMs. Continuing in a straight line across the gallery,
you reach the main hall, where train tickets are sold at the windows and
at automatic machines. Public toilets and luggage check are at either
end of the platform area.
Outside the main hall is Piazza dei Cinquecento, the largest bus terminal
in Rome. Termini is the major public transportation hub of the city, with
many bus lines starting here, and with the two Roman subway lines
crossing underneath (see “Getting Around Rome,” later in this chapter).
The main taxi stand is just outside the main hall near the metro sign on
the right. For some mysterious reason, the line forms at the end farthest
from the exit of the train station, so depending on how many people are
waiting, you may have to walk a bit. Take your cab from the line of taxis
(taxis are white, with a yellow-and-black checkered line on the side and a
taxi sign on the roof).
Although they’ve virtually disappeared, a few gypsy cabbies hang around
the station and approach people as they walk from the train to the taxi
line. Reject their offers; be firm; and get in line for a regulation ride.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Rome started outgrowing its Ancient Roman and medieval walls (the
medieval city walls were built on top of the Roman walls, some of which
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

are still standing in places) in the 20th century and has seen an immense
urban sprawl over the past two decades. The city is divided by the river
Tevere (Tiber), which meanders southward, leaving about a third of the
city on its western bank and the rest on its eastern bank. The historic
center of Rome within the walls, called il centro, remains the heart of the
city and the area you most want to visit.
Il Centro
The western bank of the Tevere holds the Vatican, the tiny city-state that
is the base of the Catholic religion, with the pope as both a religious and
administrative leader; its major feature is the basilica of San Pietro. North
of the Vatican is the largish area called Prati, crossed by the busy Via Cola
di Rienzo. Also on the western bank in il centro are the Gianicolo hill and
Trastevere.
On the eastern bank of the Tevere is the political, cultural, commercial,
and tourist heart of the city. About three millennia of consecutive layers 
of urban development have created a confused layout of streets, with 
tiny medieval roads crossed by larger and more recent avenues. At the
east end on Piazza dei Cinquecento is Termini — Rome’s main train sta-
tion and major public transportation hub. Branching out of Piazza dei
Cinquecento (and the connected Piazza della Repubblica to the west) are
three major downhill avenues: The central one is Via Nazionale, leading
to Piazza Venezia, continuing along Via del Plebiscito and Corso Vittorio
Emanuele II all the way to the River Tiber, and across it to St. Peter’s and
the Vatican. The two other avenues are Via Cavour, heading toward the
Colosseum, and Via Barberini, which leads into Via Veneto and Via del
Tritone. The major cross streets are Via del Corso and Via dei Fori
Imperiali, joining Piazza del Popolo at one end and, through Piazza
Venezia, the Colosseum at the other. Beyond the Colosseum, you find 
the start of Via Appia, the first highway created by the Ancient Romans. 
A section of it — still showing the ancient pavement — has been trans-
formed into an archaeological and natural park (see Chapter 11).
Because il centro is so large, we have divided it into several smaller
neighborhoods. All neighborhoods in il centro are desirable places to
stay, with lively nightlife, restaurants, and cafes nearby. The neighbor-
hoods are identified on the “Rome Orientation” map in this chapter.
Aventino
This elegant residential neighborhood is one of the original seven hills of
Rome, where a number of monasteries were built in the Middle Ages. It
has known very little urban development since, and today, it’s a unique
island of quiet, where small restaurants and a few hotels are surrounded
by greenery and peaceful streets. It is well connected through public
transportation to all other destinations in Rome.
Part III: Settling into Rome 
82

Campo de’ Fiori
In the southern area of il centro along the left bank of the Tiber, this
authentic neighborhood is mostly residential but is made very lively 
by the market square and the connected commercial strip of Via dei
Giubbonari. Here, you’ll find plenty of restaurants and an active
nightlife. Among the attractions is the beautiful Palazzo Farnese.
Colosseo
The Colosseum was at the heart of ancient Rome, and the area around 
it is a romantic mix of residential buildings and ruins. The Colosseo is
home to the most illustrious monuments of ancient Rome, including
the Palatino; the Roman Forum; the Campidoglio; and, of course, the
Colosseum itself. To the north, in an area sloping up along Via Cavour, 
is a very authentic and residential neighborhood. Although not elegant,
it is experiencing new life with the opening of trendy restaurants, small
hotels, and bars. To the east is another small residential and very
Roman neighborhood, with a few hotels and some nice neighborhood
restaurants.
Navona/Pantheon
At the hearth of il centro on the southwestern side of the Corso, this lively
neighborhood is a mix of elegant Renaissance and medieval buildings,
including the beautiful palaces that house the government and the two
chambers of the Italian Parliament (the Parlamento and Senato). Many
hotels occupy this area, and several nice restaurants and bars can be
found along Via del Governo Vecchio. Some of Rome’s best antiques
shops line the Via dei Coronari. Graced by two of Rome’s greatest
attractions — Piazza Navona and the Pantheon — at its heart, this is
one of the most desirable areas to stay; its popularity means that you
have to put up with crowds, especially in summer.
Parioli
Beyond the city walls and north of the Villa Borghese park, this residen-
tial neighborhood, with some hotels and restaurants, is among the most
elegant in the city. Its many trees perfume the air and provide a beautiful
(and, more important, shady) place for a quiet stroll. Though the prices
match the area’s exclusivity, this is a great place to be — you’re just a
short ride from many attractions, yet far from the madding crowd.
Piazza del Popolo
At the north edge of il centro, around one of the most beautiful squares
of Rome, this lively neighborhood has a lot of trendy new restaurants
and bars in the area extending west of the Corso.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

Piazza di Spagna
In il centro, on the east side of the Corso, this former residential neigh-
borhood has been almost completely taken over by the fashion and
tourist industries. It is the best shopping neighborhood in Rome, home
to all the great names of Italian couture, plus a lot of other tony shops. It
has many hotels, including some of the city’s best. The shopping streets
get a bit deserted at night, and if you’re seeking some nightlife, you have
to edge toward Fontana di Trevi or cross over the Corso.
Porta Pia
Taking its name from a gate in the city walls at the northeast corner of il
centro, this well-to-do residential area is almost as upscale as the Parioli.
It’s an interesting mix of beautiful villas and elegant buildings from the
18th and 19th centuries and middle-class dwellings. Very well connected
by public transportation, it has many places to eat, hang out, and relax.
It’s an excellent choice for quieter, moderately priced accommodations
that are still quite central to the big attractions.
Prati
This “new” residential neighborhood (it is not part of il centro) on the
western bank of the Tiber takes its name from the fields, or prati, that
still existed here at the end of the 19th century. It stretches north from
St. Peter’s Basilica and Castel Sant’Angelo along the Tiber. Reflecting 
its late-19th-century origin, streets are wide and straight, and lined with
trees. The area is pleasant and close to il centro; it has a relatively active,
if subdued, nightlife, with restaurants, jazz clubs, and an important
shopping area along Via Cola di Rienzo.
Repubblica
Piazza della Repubblica is a gorgeous square created over what was 
the main hall of Diocletian’s thermal baths, a few steps west of Piazza 
dei Cinquecento and the Termini train station. The areas along Via
Cernaia on one side of the square and Via Nazionale on the other are
lively during the day because of the numerous shops and offices, but 
not particularly happening at night, when it turns into a quiet residen-
tial neighborhood with a few hotels and restaurants. Very convenient 
to most of Rome’s attractions and very well connected by public trans-
portation, this is a good alternative to the more glamorous and pricey
areas of il centro.
San Pietro
On the western bank of the Tiber, this area is mainly occupied by the
walled city of the Vatican (seat of the Holy See and site of the Vatican
Museums and the Sistine Chapel). It is dominated, of course, by the
grandiose Basilica di San Pietro (St. Peter’s Basilica). Flanking the 
basilica are two ancient and picturesque residential neighborhoods 
that are home to a few hotels and restaurants.
Part III: Settling into Rome 
86

Teatro Marcello
This area covers what is still commonly referred to as the Ghetto, the
old Jewish neighborhood at the edge of ancient Rome. It is among the
most authentic of the neighborhoods in il centro and remains very resi-
dential. Some nice restaurants are tucked away in its small streets, along
with pubs, local shops, and a few archaeological treasures.
Testaccio
This neighborhood is named for Monte Testaccio, which is not a mountain
but actually a heap of broken pots collected in A.D. 55 after Emperor Nero
whimsically ordered that the shards (testae) be gathered and dumped
here. Though the top of this dangerously shifting mountain is closed to
visitors (the stack, now covered with dirt and grass, is 200 feet high),
dwellings that were dug into its lower slopes over the centuries still exist.
Many of them now house restaurants and jazz clubs. Testaccio is a real
Roman neighborhood, famous for its nightlife; big crowds of people flock
here after dark, particularly in summer. During the day, it is quieter,
though livened by an open-air food market.
Trastevere
Located on the western bank of the Tiber at the foot of the Gianicolo hill,
this neighborhood is just across the river from the Aventino. Literally
meaning “on the other side of the Tiber,” during ancient Roman times, this
was the traditional (and rather seedy) residence of poorer artisans and
workers. Its character was preserved during the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance, and to some extent up to the last century. In recent times,
though, it has been largely transformed into an artsy, cultured neighbor-
hood, famous for its restaurants, street life, and nightlife, appealing to
younger and not-so-young Romans and visitors.
Trevi
At the heart of il centro on the east side of the Corso, this neighborhood
slopes up the Quirinale hill with the magnificent Renaissance presiden-
tial (formerly papal) residence as its centerpiece. Aside from the tourist
hubbub around its famous fountain — always surrounded by a sea of
humanity — it’s a relatively unspoiled neighborhood with many small
restaurants and shops.
Via Veneto
Made famous by Fellini as the heart of La Dolce Vita, this elegant street
is lined by famous hotels and a few upscale stores. The environs are
very quiet at night and have a number of nice hotels in the side streets
but relatively few restaurants and nightspots. Well connected by public
transportation, the areas behind the glitzy strip of Via Veneto are actu-
ally a good alternative to the glamorous and expensive parts of il centro,
especially if you go toward Via XX Settembre (at the southeastern edge
of this neighborhood).
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

Finding information after you arrive

 Castel Sant’Angelo, Piazza Pia, to the west of the Castel
Sant’Angelo (% 06-68809707; Metro: Ottaviano–San Pietro)
 Largo Goldoni, on Via del Corso at Via Condotti (% 06-68136061;
Metro: Piazza di Spagna)
 Piazza delle Cinque Lune, off Piazza Navona to the north (% 06-

Usually, the staff at the info points in or near Termini station are the
most overwhelmed; elsewhere, you’ll find people more available to
assist you.
The Holy See, as a separate state, maintains its own tourist office. It is
located in Piazza San Pietro (% 06-69884466; Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.),
just left of the entrance to the Basilica di San Pietro. The office has infor-
mation on the Vatican and on its tourist attractions and religious events.
You may also make reservations for a visit to the Vatican gardens or fill
out the form to participate in a papal audience — but we recommend
you make a reservation to do so before you leave home (see Chapter 11
for more information).

Getting Around Rome
Rome’s historic hills are no myth: They are real — and sometimes even
steep. The one myth is that there are only seven of them. Rome may
look flat on a map, but it’s very hilly — you’ll soon understand why
locals use mopeds (or cars, unfortunately) and public transportation,
and why you see so few bicycles around.
Remember also that the city is thousands of years old, meaning that
much of it isn’t designed for any mode of conveyance other than the
human foot. There are times, however, when you’ll welcome public
transportation. Taxis, for example, are a great convenience at night
when crossing large sections of the city.
Rome is generally very safe, especially in the center, though you should
follow all the usual big-city precautions. The most common form of
crime is pickpocketing, which is practiced extensively and with great
skill at crowded locations, such as on buses and at markets. Roving
gangs of gypsy children are now less common than they once were; they
virtually surround you, creating distraction and confusion, while some
artful dodger picks your pocket. Hold tight to your wallet and purse, 
and brush your way past with a stern “no.” In addition, don’t walk on 
the edge of the sidewalk near the curb — thieves on motor scooters
sometimes yank bags or purses from people’s shoulders.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 89
Getting a ticket to ride
ATAC (% 800-431784 or 06-46952027; www.atac.roma.it), Rome’s transport
authority, runs all metros, trams, and buses in the city, and one ticket is valid for all
public transportation in Rome. You need to buy tickets before boarding any mode of
transportation, and you must stamp them upon boarding, or they aren’t valid (on
subway and trains, the stamping machines — little yellow boxes — are at the entrance
gates; on buses and trams, they’re onboard). A regular biglietto (ticket) for the bus/
metro is valid for 75 minutes and costs 1€ ($1.30). Within the 75 minutes of validity, you
can take as many buses and trams as you want, but you can take only one subway
ride. If you’re on a different bus from the one you stamped your ticket on when you
approach the expiration of the 75 minutes of validity, stamp your ticket again at its
other end; this will show that you boarded the bus during the period of validity of your
ticket and not after it expired, so you’ll be in the clear if a ticket inspector boards the
bus. You can also get a daily pass called BIG and costing 4€ ($5.20), a three-day ticket
called BTI for 11€ ($14), and a weekly pass called CIS for 16€ ($21). All passes give
you unlimited rides on bus, metro, and urban trains. You can buy tickets at most bars,
tobacconist shops (signed TABACCHI or by a white T on a black background), and news-
stands. Tickets and passes are also sold at the ticket booths in the metro, at the ATAC
bus information booth in front of Stazione Termini (near Platform C), and from machines
at many locations (but machines usually take only exact change).

By subway (metropolitana)
Although the Metropolitana, or metro for short, has only two lines, it is
the best way to get around because the underground routes don’t suffer
from the terrible city traffic. In addition, the routes naturally stay the
same — unlike the city bus system, which is under constant reorganiza-
tion. Line A and Line B cross at the Termini station, which is also the
head of many bus lines. A big red M marks all metro entrances. Metro A
runs near San Pietro, passing Piazza di Spagna and the Palazzo Barberini
(Via Veneto) on one side and San Giovanni on the other. Take Line B 
to get to the Colosseum. The metro runs Sunday through Friday from
5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and Saturday from 5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
The Colosseum, Circus Maximus, and Cavour stops on Line B don’t offer
full elevator/lift service and aren’t disabled accessible. (For tips for trav-
elers with disabilities, see Chapter 6.)
By bus (autobus)
The ATAC bus system is large and under continuous improvement.
However, Rome’s ancient layout resists any real modernization, so things
don’t always go smoothly: Buses are very crowded at rush hour, and traf-
fic jams are endemic. Still, buses remain an excellent resource because
they go absolutely everywhere in Rome, especially the diminutive electric
buses that are the only vehicles allowed in the tiny, narrow streets of the
historical heart of the city. These electric buses are the ones you’ll be
using most often: 115 in Trastevere and on the Gianicolo; 116, 116T, 117,
and 119 in il centro. Of the large number of regular bus lines that service
Rome — and many of them overlap in the center of town — the bus you’re
most likely to use is 64 (Stazione Termini–Vatican). Most buses run daily
from 5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., but some stop at 8.30 p.m. A few night lines
are marked with an N for notturno (night); they usually run every hour,
leaving the ends of the line on the hour.
When you arrive in Rome, one of the first things you should do is pick
up an updated bus map from the bus information booth outside the
Termini station in Piazza dei Cinquecento, provided that it has one —
there is such a demand that the government can never print enough.
Routes we mention in this book may have changed.
On foot
Walking is by far the best way to experience Rome, because you see the
most as you wander the curving streets that merge, narrow to almost
shoulder width, change names, and meander among beautiful old build-
ings. Wear very comfortable shoes, and be ready to switch to another
form of transportation — usually handy — when you get tired.

To enjoy Rome’s delightful labyrinth, you need a good map. The free
tourist-office map is quite good, but it doesn’t have a stradario (street
directory), which is essential for locating addresses. You can buy a
detailed city map with a stradario at any newsstand and many bookstores.
By tram
Rome still has a few tram lines, which belong to the same system as the
buses. They aren’t as spectacular as the cable cars in San Francisco, but
they’re fun to ride. Also, trams have a separate lane to themselves, so
they’re less frequently stopped by traffic. The routes are long, however,
and you may have an extended — though scenic — ride on your way to
your destination. A line we like a lot is the 3, which passes by the Basilica
di San Giovanni and the Colosseum. Another line that you’re likely to use
is number 8 to Trastevere. Trams are indicated on the free ATAC bus
map by a green line.

By taxi
Taxi rates are reasonable in Rome, but taking a taxi can be expensive
during those busy times of day when you’re stuck in traffic. They’re a
great resource for getting to your hotel from the train station and travel-
ing around at night after the buses and metro stop running.
Taxi fare starts at 2.35€ ($3), and the meter adds 0.80€ ($1) for every
kilometer (2⁄3 mile) if you’re moving at least 20kmph (12 mph); if you’re
stuck in traffic, the meter racks up a charge of .10€ (13¢) every 19 sec-
onds. Don’t forget the night surcharge (10 p.m.–6 a.m.) of 2.60€ ($3.40),
the Sunday and holiday surcharge of 1€ ($1.30), or the luggage supple-
ment of 1€ ($1.30) for each bag put in the trunk.
Taxis don’t cruise the streets, as in most U.S. cities; they return to taxi
stands and wait for a call. Hence, you usually cannot hail a taxi on the
street unless you happen to find one that’s returning to a stand. You’ll
find many taxi stands around Rome, especially in il centro near major
landmarks, including Piazza Barberini (at the foot of Via Veneto), 
Piazza San Silvestro, and Piazza SS. Apostoli (both not far from the
Trevi Fountain). You can identify taxi stands by a smallish telephone on
a pole marked TAXI. But if you’re starting from a place with a phone — a
hotel, restaurant, and so on — asking the staff to call a taxi for you is
easiest. For a 24-hour radio taxi, call % 06-88177, 06-6645, or 06-4994.
By motor scooter (motorino)
Most Romans travel around via moped, or so it seems when you’re on 
a street corner waiting for the signal to turn green. If you have some 
two-wheel experience — Rome is most definitely not the place to learn
how to operate a scooter — the best spot to rent a motorino is Treno e
Scooter (TeS) on Via Marsala, just outside Stazione Termini by the taxi
stand and metro entrance (% 06-48905823). TeS gives you a 10 percent
discount if you’ve traveled by train that day. The scooters are very good
quality, and the prices (for example, 52€/$68 for the weekend) include
insurance, taxes, and a free map; TeS also rents bicycles. To get there,
take the metro to Termini. Rent a Scooter Borgo, Via delle Grazie 2, off
Via di Porta Angelica, on the right side of the Vatican (% 06-6877239;
Metro: Ottaviano), and New Scooter, Via Quattro Novembre 96, up from
Piazza Venezia (% 06-6790300; Bus: 64), are also good options. You can
get a complete list from one of the tourist information points.
Riding a scooter can be quite dangerous in Rome’s busiest areas.
Accidents are increasingly common, and scooters are pretty flimsy com-
pared with cars. However, it’s a great way to travel on Sundays and holi-
days, when traffic is light and fewer buses are out, or to explore quiet
neighborhoods.

Checking In at Rome’s 
Best Hotels
In This Chapter
 Finding the best rates
 Booking the best room
 Selecting the best hotel
 Locating hotels by neighborhood and price
R
ome has been a magnet for travelers for literally thousands of
years. More than a few inns can claim several centuries of service,
and as the flow of visitors remains strong, new hotels keep opening every
year. This creates an enormous variety in Rome’s hotels and gives lodg-
ing in Rome a different character from that of, say, the United States.
Although the hotel industry in Rome has made enormous progress
toward standardization and upgrading of lodging in line with the expec-
tations of international travelers, there are cultural differences that are
hard to iron out — and why not, because traveling also means experi-
encing a different culture? That’s not to say you shouldn’t be comfort-
able. This chapter gives important tips on choosing among a wide, and
in some cases unfamiliar, variety of choices.
Knowing Your Roman Hotels: What to Expect
Destination to some 20 million tourists every year, Rome offers a huge
choice of accommodations, from very basic to supremely elegant, from
family-run historical hotels to international chains, and from mom-and-
pop places to the haunts of jet setters. Most hotels are private businesses,
not belonging to a chain. Some may belong to a hotel association — 
which fixes standards, gives a common approach, or simply allows some
economies of scale. With such a variety, you’ll certainly find what you
need, but keep in mind that in general, rooms — especially bathrooms —
and beds tend to be smaller than what you’re used at home. Space is at a
premium, especially in the historical palaces within il centro storico (the
historic center) — which is where you want to be — and only the most
expensive hotels can offer sizable rooms and bathrooms.

Because medieval and Renaissance buildings were not designed for ele-
vators, they are rare — absent in the cheaper hotels — and often start
from a landing above street level. Steps are ubiquitous, so if they’re a
problem for you, make sure to call and ask. When you do, be very spe-
cific, and ask how many steps you have to climb from the street. Even in
the most expensive hotels, there might be a short flight of steps to reach
the lobby from the street and another to reach the elevator. The street
level of Renaissance and baroque palazzi was not a living floor (imagine
the stench of those times), and the main stairwell usually starts from 
an internal alcove or courtyard. Elevators have commonly been con-
structed inside the narrow stairwell enclosed by the staircases — the
only space available — and this is why they often can’t be accessed 
from curbside.
Then there are amenities: Some that are commonplace in the United
States — big ice machines, for instance — are virtually unknown in 
Italy. But others, such as air-conditioning and satellite TV — necessary
to view English-language programs — are now more the rule than the
exception, although you may have to pay extra for them in smaller and
cheaper hotels (we spell this out in our write-ups). By the way, regular
TVs are standard except in the cheapest accommodations, but they
don’t offer English-language programs. Then again, you didn’t go to Italy
to watch TV, did you? And you can always step out of your hotel and sit
at the terrace of a nearby cafe for that iced drink. . . .
Fortunately, soundproofed rooms are commonplace — and even in the
cheaper hotels, the thickness of the old walls helps protect you from
noisy neighbors and the roar of the traffic outside. Street noise, by the
way, is a problem that soundproofed windows cannot eliminate if you like
to sleep with your window open. If that is the case, ask for an inner room.
Smoking has recently been banned from public places in Rome, so all
hotel lobbies and breakfast rooms are smoke free. Rooms, though, are
considered private; hence, you are allowed to smoke there. Make sure 
to specify whether you want a smoke-free room when you make your
reservation.
Another big difference is breakfast: Although this important meal is gen-
erally included in your room rate, and although an increasing number 
of hotels offer a buffet, eggs and hot dishes are served only at the most
expensive hotels. The usual continental buffet includes a choice of
breads, jams, and fruit; sometimes cakes; and usually cereals, yogurt,
cheese, and cold cuts. Sometimes you can order — and pay extra for —
eggs and bacon if they aren’t on the spread.
One more thing: When you make a hotel reservation back home, you
probably don’t ask about the flooring. In Rome, you’ll often find tile or
marble floors, sometimes wood, and only rarely carpeting. So bring 
slippers to get around the room and go to the bathroom in the cooler
months if you don’t want to get cold feet!

96

Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Getting the room you want at the right price is the name of the game.
Many hotels have been refurbished recently, and several new ones have
opened, but prices have risen sharply in recent years. A weak dollar and
poor exchange rate haven’t helped. Rome is a capital city, and capital
cities the world over are expensive. The best way to get a deal is to plan
well in advance.
Finding the best rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel can charge for a room. That’s
the rate you get if you walk in off the street at the peak of high season
and ask for a room for the night when the hotel is almost full. You see
these rates printed on the fire/emergency-exit diagrams posted on the
back of your hotel-room door.
In Rome, where most hotels don’t belong to chains, you’ll rarely be
charged the rack rate. Chains are happy to charge you the rack rate, but
you can almost always do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying
the rack rate is surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted
rate. You may be pleasantly surprised.
The rate you pay for a room usually depends on many factors — chief
among them being how you make your reservation. In Rome, a travel
agent may be able to negotiate a better price than you can get by your-
self, but only with those hotels belonging to a chain. (That’s because the
hotel often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her
business toward that hotel.) Exploring package tours, in which both air-
line fares and hotel rooms are priced at a discount, is also worthwhile.
(See Chapter 5 for more on this.)
With hotel chains, reserving a room through the central reservation toll-
free number may result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On
the other hand, the central reservation number may not know about dis-
count rates for special events at specific locations. Your best bet is to
call both the local number and the toll-free number, and see which one
gives you a better deal.
As a general rule, nonchain hotels in Rome will give you their lowest
price when you make your reservation directly. Room rates change with
the season and with occupancy: If a hotel is half-empty, you’ll likely get 
a better rate than if it has only one room available — but the rates they
agree on with agents are based on seasons, not occupancy, and there-
fore tend to be higher. Refer to Chapter 3 for more details on high and
low seasons in Rome.
Most hotels in Rome offer special-event deals — such as Easter, the big
shopping sales in January, or a special art exhibition (see Chapter 3 for
a calendar of events). They may also offer a special rate for a two- or
three-night stay and sometimes a weekend rate (which you may see
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 97

abbreviated WE elsewhere). Always ask if there are any specials when
you make your reservation. Also, always check the hotel’s Web site — it
often offers special Internet deals (see “Surfing the Web for hotel deals,”
later in this chapter).
Finally, if you’re Irish or British, be sure to mention membership in any
automobile clubs, which may have reciprocity with Automobile Club
d’Italia or the Touring Club Italiano; you may get a 10 percent discount.
Frequent-flier programs with Alitalia and sometimes other European 
carriers also may get you some points. Unfortunately, U.S. associations
such as AARP and AAA usually have nothing to do with private Italian
businesses, although some international chains offer discounts for these
associations.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: through
the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking agency (or
a fare-service agency like Priceline.com). Booking through the hotel’s
own Web site is definitely the way to go in Rome: Many private hotels
have started to offer special online rates, which are often cheaper even
than what an agency can get you for the same place. Some also offer 
significant discounts for advance booking, provided that you also pay 
in advance. Another method is to narrow your options via one of the
Internet agencies listed later in this section and then check the Web site
of the hotel you selected directly. You’ll often find that you can do better
on the hotel’s site — the hotel doesn’t have to pay any agency fees.
Internet hotel agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers lately,
competing for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accom-
modations around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to
consumers who have the patience and time to shop and compare the
online sites for good deals — but shop you must, because prices can
vary considerably from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the
top of a site’s listing may be there for no other reason than it paid money
to get the placement. Among the many sites existing for Rome, we rec-
ommend Venere Net (www.venere.com), which is very comprehensive
and user friendly, as well as Roma Hotels (www.roma-hotels.com) and
the Cooperativa Il Sogno (www.romeguide.it), which is also compre-
hensive and has good descriptions of the hotels (with pictures). Among
the intercontinental agencies, hoteldiscount!com (www.180096hotel.
com), which lists bargain room rates at many hotels in Rome, is good, 
as is Late Rooms.com (www.it.laterooms.com) — excellent for last-
minute deals on hotels and B&Bs. Other sites to check are Italyhotelink.
com (www.italyhotelink.com), ITWG.com (www.itwg.com), Welcome
to Italy (www.wel.it), Europa Hotels (www.europa-hotels.com), and
Italy Hotels (www.hotels-in-italy.com).
Most intercontinental sites tend to list only a few hotels in Rome. 
Still, some may offer good deals, and it is worth checking just in case.
Part III: Settling into Rome 
98

Expedia offers special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of available
rooms so you can see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps counter
the claims that the best rooms are often held back from bargain-booking
Web sites). Travelocity posts frank customer reviews and ranks its prop-
erties according to the AAA rating system. Also reliable and easy to use
is Hotels.com. InnSite (www.innsite.com) is a good source for locating
B&Bs in Rome — you can see pictures of the rooms and check prices
and availability, though keep in mind that the descriptions are written
by the innkeepers (and getting an inn listed is free).
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel — but that’s all — before offer-
ing up your money. Priceline’s hotel product is much better at getting
five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding anything at the
bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests
in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the BiddingforTravel
Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bidding on a hotel room
on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses
in major cities, including Rome. For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay
up front, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels don’t provide
loyalty-program credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities when
you book a room through opaque online services.
If you book your room through one of these online services, always get a
confirmation number, and make a printout of any online booking trans-
action in case your reservation is lost. Actually, after you’ve reserved
your rooms, it doesn’t hurt to contact your hotel and request a confir-
mation via fax or e-mail, to eliminate the chance of your arriving at a
hotel that has no record of your reservation. Make sure that you bring
this confirmation fax/e-mail with you to Italy.
Reserving the best room
First and foremost, make your reservations well ahead of time, espe-
cially if you decide to stay in a small hotel: The best rooms are the first
to go.
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Ask for a corner room. Corner rooms are usually larger, quieter,
and have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more. (This may not be true, though, if the hotel occupies
only part of a historical building, where corner rooms may actually be
smaller and darker.) Always ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request
a room away from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location
of elevators, restaurants, and bars in the hotel — all sources of annoying
noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to
the front desk. If the hotel has another room, it should be happy to
accommodate you, within reason.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 99

Finding Alternative Accommodations:
Apartments to Convents
Rome offers several accommodation options beyond hotels. If you plan to
stay for a week or more, you may want to consider renting an apartment.
Another option is to stay at one of the many convents and other religious
houses that rent out rooms; they allow couples, and although the rooms
aren’t monastic cells, they don’t offer many frills. In this book, we don’t
list religious houses that accept guests, because they usually have cur-
fews (10 or 11 p.m., sometimes even earlier), and we don’t think that you
want to deal with that, especially if your trip is relatively short. If you’re
interested, however, the Cooperativa Il Sogno (www.romeguide.it) is
probably your best resource.
If you want to rent an apartment, consult an organization that special-
izes in such arrangements. Vacation Rentals by Owner (www.vrbo.com)
lists hundreds of homes for rent (listings are in English). Each listing
contains pictures, prices, and descriptions of the area where the house
or apartment is located. Usually, you deal directly with the owner, so
you may save considerably over the rates that would be charged for the
same property by a broker.
B&Bs are also an option, but don’t expect romantic getaways: In Rome, 
a B&B is often just a one-room operation in somebody’s home where 
you also get breakfast. Most of the Italy-based Internet agencies also
maintain apartment and B&Bs listings (see the section “Surfing the 
Web for hotel deals,” earlier in this chapter). Other agencies to try are
Hideaways International (767 Islington St., Portsmouth, NH 03801; 
% 800/843-4433; www.hideaways.com), At Home Abroad (405 E. 56th
St., Suite 6H, New York, NY 10022; % 212/421-9165), and Rentals in 
Italy (700 East Main St., Ventura, CA 93001; % 800/726-6702 or 805/641-
1650; www.rentvillas.com).
Arriving without a Reservation
In Rome, arriving without a room reservation is usually not a problem:
You will find something, although you may have to compromise with loca-
tion and price. The hotel desks at the airport and in the train station
Termini are the best place to start. The staff will call around town and find
you a room, if one is available. (In the high season, there’s always the risk
that rooms aren’t available — or at least not in your price range.) Some-
times this service is free, and sometimes you have to pay a small fee. 
Rome’s Best Hotels
In selecting our favorite hotels, we use cleanliness, comfort, and the
most amenities at the best prices as essential criteria. All the hotels we
Part III: Settling into Rome 
100

list in this section are conveniently located in the center of Rome, have
private bathrooms, and offer basic amenities. We always specify in the
description if a hotel has no elevator, satellite TV, or air-conditioning. In
addition to giving you exact prices, we use a system of dollar signs ($) 
to show a range of costs for hotels (see Table 9-1). The dollar signs 
correspond to rack rates (nondiscounted, standard rates) for a double
room. If the hotel offers triples, quads, or suites, we also give rack rates
for those. To help you further with the selection, we’ve created quick-
reference indexes at the end of this chapter that list all the hotels by
neighborhood and by dollar sign.
Table 9-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
What to Expect
$
120€ ($156) 
No frills but dignified; usually family-run small 
or less
hotels housed in oldish buildings. Rooms tend 
to be small; televisions are not necessarily 
provided; and you may have to pay extra for 
air-conditioning. These hotels may not accept
credit cards and may not have an elevator.
$$
121€–230€
These are middle-range hotels: All guest rooms 
($157–$299)
have air-conditioning and a good level of 
amenities and service. Bathrooms tend to 
be small at the bottom end of the scale, but 
bedrooms are always roomy and pleasantly 
furnished. The category also includes some of 
the higher-end hotels that are located in less
glamorous areas.
$$$
231€–350€
These are superior hotels where you get a 
($300–$455)
bathroom that’s really a room, not a corner, and
bedrooms that are spacious and have a number
of amenities; they may even be luxurious in 
the less expensive neighborhoods. Service is
excellent, and a nice buffet breakfast is usually
included.
$$$$
351€ ($456) 
These are deluxe hotels, sometimes owned by 
and up
international interests. They offer lots of space;
attentive professional staff; and top amenities,
ranging from antique furnishings and fine linen to
lavish bathrooms, free parking (a luxury in Rome),
gyms, spas, terraces, and often gardens with
pools. Usually, an American-style breakfast is
included. Hotels in this category occupy new 
or very historic buildings, such as former 
aristocratic palazzos or villas.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 101

Important note: Very few hotels in Rome have a garage or their own
parking lot; instead, they usually have some kind of agreement with a
nearby facility for somewhat reduced rates. If you plan to bring a car
(which we warmly discourage — see Chapter 7), ask your hotel for the
rates when you book your room, but expect to pay between 15€ and
30€ ($20–$39) per day.
Bernini Bristol
$$$$
Via Veneto
One of the best hotels in Rome, we particularly appreciate it for its great
position — just at the foot of Via Veneto — and its impeccable service, pro-
vided at (relatively) moderate rates. Opened in 1874, it served as the back-
ground location for many scenes of Dan Brown’s novel Angels and Demons.
Its guest rooms are classically furnished with fine linen and elegant marble
baths; some of them offer great views over il centro. From the splendid
rooftop restaurant, the Olympus, you can enjoy a 360-degree view over
Rome; the hotel also has a spa and gym for its guests. It sometimes has
great Internet specials.

Casa Kolbe
$
Teatro Marcello
Near the Jewish Ghetto, steps from the major classical sites — the Capitoline
Hill, Palatine Hill, Roman Forum, and Colosseum — this is an old-fashioned
hotel in a former convent. The guest rooms are clean but a little worn, and
the furnishings are simple. For the price, however, you can’t beat it. This is
a peaceful area, and the quietest rooms overlook the small inner garden.
Many tour groups book here, so reserve in advance. A number of rooms are
disabled-accessible, but there is no air-conditioning. Room-and-board com-
binations are available.

double. Rates include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Casa Valdese
$
Prati
Located on the Vatican side of the river, near Castel Sant’Angelo and the
shopping district of Cola di Rienzo, this small hotel offers a great value.
The name “Valdese” refers to the Protestant group of Swiss origin, and the
hotel reflects this in its simple but spotlessly clean and pleasant rooms.
The very moderate prices and the excellent location — basically across
the river from Piazza del Popolo — are other pluses.

City Hotel
$$
Piazza di Spagna/Via Veneto
Located on the third floor of a nice palazzo (with an elevator from street
level), this hotel offers comfortable rooms, well appointed and recently
renovated, and decent-size marble and tile bathrooms, all at moderate
prices. Nice woodwork and bright spaces add to the atmosphere. The fur-
nishings are tasteful, and the service, excellent. It also has the great advan-
tage of a perfect location, walking distance from the Piazza di Spagna
(Spanish Steps) and the Fontana di Trevi (Trevi Fountain), and very well
connected to public transportation — a rare advantage in il centro.

Grand Hotel de la Minerve
$$$$
Navona/Pantheon
This very elegant hotel is located in one of our preferred small squares in the
center of Rome and offers magnificent accommodations and service.
Housed in a 17th-century palace, the spacious guest rooms are elegantly
appointed with stylish contemporary furnishings whispering of comfort and
excellent taste; some of the rooms have beautifully decorated ceilings with
fine moldings. The marble bathrooms are spacious and with all manner of
amenities. In the warm season, the hotel’s restaurant moves to the roof
garden, where you can enjoy a gorgeous view over the dome-studded sky-
line. You can enjoy live music in the bar every evening. A very nice gym is
located on the premises.

Hotel Andreotti
$$
Repubblica
This quietly elegant hotel is within walking distance of many attractions
and very accessible to public transportation. Its location, in a somewhat
less glamorous area of the center, means that you get better service and
amenities for a lower price. Guest rooms are large and comfortable, each
differently furnished but all in classic style, and bathrooms are good size
and modern; some rooms have ceilings decorated with original moldings.
The courteous service is a plus.

Hotel Arenula
$
Campo de’ Fiori/Teatro Marcello
This hotel offers large and well-appointed guest rooms at moderate prices.
Above all, you can’t beat the location. On the second floor of a nice
palazzo, with a beautiful marble spiral staircase leading to it (but be
warned — there is no elevator), it lies within walking distance of many of
the center’s main attractions and to buses and trams that will take you to
the others. The nearby Campo is busy with a market during the day and

bright, with decent-size bathrooms and showers, and good amenities.

Hotel Art
$$$$
Piazza di Spagna
This new hotel, located in one of the most desirable areas of Rome, edges
beyond modern into the realm of postmodern. If you don’t get a room here,
go just to see the hall and the court, with its crystal staircase and designer-
contemporary furnishings, and the bar — created in the columned and
frescoed chapel of a palace. All these striking features illustrate the artis-
tic “eclecticism” on which the hotel prides itself. Each floor is color coor-
dinated with the details of the rooms (even down to the stationery and
pens), and much of the furniture is made of fine hardwoods. Hotel Art has
much the feel of the boutique hotels you find in all the great cities of the
world. The accent is on comfort; service; and, of course, style. Check its
Web site for Internet specials.

chapter) and known for its excellent service, the Capo d’Africa offers com-
fortable rooms furnished in a warm, modern-ethnic style. The marble bath-
rooms are good size and nicely fitted out. The hotel also offers some suites

Colosseo
This small hotel is a real jewel, housed in an 1870 building just steps from
some of the city’s most famous monuments. Rooms are individually dec-
orated in Renaissance and Ancient Roman style, with mosaic floors and
frescoed walls. The beautiful bathrooms are done in marble and mosaics.
The decoration and the furnishings — fine modern reproductions and
some antiques — are the essence of what people mean by “old-world
charm.” The roof terrace, where breakfast is served in the fine weather,
enjoys gorgeous views over Ancient Rome — as do the three private ter-
races of the Pompeian suite.

Hotel de Russie

Piazza di Spagna
Making the lists of the world’s top hotels ever since it opened in 2000, the
Russie is the most elegant place to stay in Rome, offering superb location,
service, and accommodations. If you stay here, you’ll follow the steps of
the rich and famous — Bill and Chelsea Clinton, among others. Housed in
a beautiful palazzo enclosing a delightful terrace garden, the hotel is fur-
nished in extremely tasteful and classy contemporary Italian style, and
guest rooms have all kinds of amenities. You’ll also find a spa with sauna;
a health club; and, amazingly enough, a swimming pool. The restaurant on

Navona/Pantheon
This small hotel, located in one of the most romantic areas of il centro, offers
elegant and stylish accommodations. Once the residence of cardinals and
bishops, it has been completely restored. The beautiful original floors alla
veneziana (marble and colored cement mosaic) or in parquet, the antiques
and quality reproduction furnishings, and the handsome bathrooms all con-
tribute to a pleasant stay. Make your reservations early — the hotel doesn’t
have many rooms.

Tucked behind Castel Sant’Angelo in a quiet neighborhood and across the
Tiber from Piazza del Popolo, this hospitable hotel occupies a 1906 patri-
cian palazzo, which has been completely renovated. Quiet and off the
tourist path, it is elegantly decorated. The guest rooms are spacious —
the largest ones geared for families — and the bathrooms are particularly
nice, clad in marble and tile and with new modern fixtures. The Farnese is
steps from one of Rome’s best shopping streets — Via Cola di Rienzo —

Piazza del Popolo
This family-run hotel is a peaceful and elegant retreat but only steps from
Piazza del Popolo. Opened in 1925, the hotel earned international fame in
1978, when it became the set and subject of the movie Hotel Locarno.
Always beloved by actors and other personalities of the movie industry, it
offers charming guest rooms furnished with antiques or reproductions.

Nouveau) details recall the origin of the building. The attentive service

Trastevere
This small hotel occupies a block of low buildings surrounding a romantic
garden–courtyard lined by a portico. Most of the guest rooms are on the
first floor and open directly on the courtyard (except one garret suite on
the second floor). Rooms are cozy and welcoming, decorated with terra-
cotta–tiled floors, whitewashed walls, and dark-wood furniture; however,
they can be a bit dark on rainy days, as all light natural comes from the
portico. The courtyard, though, is a pleasant place to take breakfast on a
sunny morning; in the afternoon and early evening, guests can have a glass
of wine from the wine bar. The suites are on two levels and are designed
for families with children (up to six beds).

Hotel Scalinata di Spagna
$$$
Piazza di Spagna
This is a charming small hotel located just above the Spanish Steps (there
is a public elevator if you’re too tired to negotiated this tourist-clogged
attraction). The guest rooms are smallish but cheery and nicely appointed;
some may have exposed beams, and two have a private small terrace. Free
Internet TV is available in every room. The marble bathrooms are fair size
but not large by any means. This place feels more like a country inn on a
hill — the view from the roof garden is spectacular — than a hotel in the
congested centro.

Hotel Teatro di Pompeo
$$
Campo de’ Fiori
The name of this hotel comes from a 55 B.C. Roman theater that lies
beneath the hotel — some of it can still be seen in the breakfast room. The
rest of the building is much newer — that is, from the 15th century — as
you see by the beamed ceilings in some of the rooms. The rooms are spa-
cious for this ancient area of Rome, and the white plaster walls and simple
furnishings give it an old-fashioned charm. The hotel is small, so reserve
your room early.

elegant guest rooms, modern furnishings, and a relaxing atmosphere. Each
room is uniquely decorated — we particularly like the red room — and

Dining and Snacking 
in Rome
In This Chapter
 Discovering Rome’s dining scene
 Seating yourself at Rome’s best restaurants
 Finding the best quick snack
I
talian gourmands long maintained that there wasn’t a really good
restaurant in Rome — but they can’t say that any longer. Rome has
hundreds of good little trattorie, osterie, and pizzerie offering traditional
local food (see Chapter 2 for more on Roman specialties and cuisine). In
addition, thanks to fresh trends sweeping the dining scene, lots of new
quality restaurants in the middle and upper-end range have appeared
and continue to appear. As a result, Romans are dining out more, both
for lunch and dinner, even during the week — which used to be a rarity
in more traditional days, when people would go out mostly on Saturday
night and Sunday lunch, and for special occasions.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Traditional Roman cuisine is based on pasta, fresh seasonal vegetables,
seafood, and meat — especially organ meat and smaller animals such 
as pork, chicken, rabbit, lamb, and goat. Preparations are usually simple 
and flavorful, and a number of “established” dishes remain great favorites
with the locals (see Chapter 2). Although like other Italians, Romans are
attached to their culinary tradition, they don’t seem to despise innova-
tion, and the many new restaurants, revisiting traditional dishes as well as
new combinations of traditional ingredients, have been very successful.
The accent in these new restaurants is always on the lightness of the dish
as well as on the quality of the ingredients — their freshness and natural
preparation. Many of them have integrated ethnic elements into their 
cuisine, such as French and Mediterranean at Bric and Middle Eastern 
at Gusto (both are reviewed in this chapter). One of the newest trends is
what Romans are calling crudi — Italian-style sashimi. Italians have always
eaten carpaccio (thinly sliced raw beef served with oil and Parmesan

cheese) or fish made in the ceviche style (prepared with lemon juice,
which in effect “cooks” the fish), but the trend toward raw fish is com-
pletely new. You can sample it at the Enoteca Capranica or at Presidente,
both reviewed in this chapter.
The best (and most convenient) areas to eat are still in il centro (the
historic center) — especially the little streets off Via di Ripetta in the
Piazza del Popolo area and the circuitous byways around the Pantheon,
around Fontana di Trevi, and around Campo de’ Fiori, where new 
restaurants are constantly cropping up. Another famed dining area is
Trastevere, a destination dear to many Romans.
A steady flow of locals — from government offices and the numerous
businesses in these areas, but also from everywhere in Rome — feeds
this constant renewal and ensures good quality. Feel free to try one of
the small restaurants in these neighborhoods even if we don’t specifi-
cally recommend it: It would be impossible to list all the good places in
Rome. Just follow your nose.
There are, however, some less likely areas for dining that have, in fact,
been developing in recent times — in residential neighborhoods such 
as Parioli along Viale Liegi and the little streets off Via Nomentana, near
Porta Pia.
Dining hours are later than in the United States. Romans sit down 
to dinner between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; lunch is between 1 and 3 p.m.
However, restaurants in il centro and in Trastevere open around noon 
for lunch and 7:30 p.m. for dinner to accommodate tourists — only pubs
and tourist joints will open any earlier than that. Nonsmokers and gour-
mets will be pleased to hear that smoking has been outlawed in public
places, but it’s still allowed in separate rooms. Although a 10 to 15 per-
cent charge for servizio (service) is often included in the price of each
dish (check for this on the menu; if it is not specified, it means that it is
not included), an extra 5 to 10 percent is expected for good service.
If you’re visiting in the summer, remember that Roman men tend to
dress in what may look rather formal to American eyes (no shorts and
rarely jeans), even during the day, and as a man, you might unpleasantly
stick out with your shorts and tank top, and may not be able to have
lunch except in the most informal eateries. Shorts and tank tops (except
for really stylish and elegant ones) are not a good choice for women,
either, but women may pass more easily.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Thanks to Rome’s dining boom, it gets easier and easier to find nice
restaurants but harder and harder to find really cheap (and good) ones,
which were once very common. However, having a good meal in Rome
remains very affordable, and you don’t need to make big sacrifices to
save a little.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 119

A common strategy is to have a bite on the go at a bar or rosticceria
for lunch (see “Dining and Snacking on the Go,” later in this chapter) 
and save your lunch money for dinner. Be prepared to stand, though,
because few bars offer sitting. Bars (what Romans call cafes, although
they serve alcohol) do, but the price surcharge for sitting at a table (à
tavola) rather than eating at the counter (al banco) is so high that you
may be better off with a small restaurant. In restaurants, you can easily
spend less by having fewer courses. The classic Roman meal includes
appetizer, pasta, secondo (meat or fish), contorno (salad, vegetables, or
potatoes), and dessert, together with copious wine and an espresso to
finish, but this kind of meal — usually stretching for a couple of hours —
is only for special occasions and on weekends. Consuming anaconda-
size meals also takes some getting used to. For lunch or a light dinner,
most Romans eat a secondo with a contorno, or even just a pasta dish
with a contorno, or a pizza (round; individual size). Dining in this fashion
will keep your expenses down.
Another thing to watch is drinks. A bottle of wine will considerably
increase your bill, but most restaurants offer vino della casa, sold by
volume (minimum un quarto — a quarter liter, or about 9 ounces), and
many have a few choices by the glass. What may surprise you is that
wine may be less expensive than soft drinks, which are a very unusual
thing to have with dinner and might significantly increase your bill. If
you’re a group or a family, agree on one kind of soda, and ask for a large
bottle (liter size) — it’s much cheaper than individual cans. Beer is also
sold in large bottles in pizzerias. Cocktails are basically unknown — in
Italy, you take your aperitivo before dinner at a bar or club, not at your
restaurant table, so it’s an expensive addition to your bill.
Rome’s Best Restaurants
We have reviewed what we feel are the best restaurants in Rome — of
course, there are many more than we have room for here, but these are
our preferred ones. Each listing is marked with dollar signs to give an
idea of the cost of a full meal, including a pasta or appetizer, a secondo
(main course or entree), a side dish, and dessert. Beverages are not
included. Note that within the restaurant listing, the numbers we give
you are the price range of the main courses, listed as secondi.
Here is a table explaining what the dollar signs translate to in terms of
cost:
Cost
Restaurant

35€ ($46) or less

At the end of this chapter, you’ll find indexes of all the restaurants we rec-
ommend: by location, by cuisine, and by $ sign. See the “Rome Snacking
and Dining” map in this chapter for the locations of all eateries we review
in this chapter.
Italy recently instituted one of Europe’s toughest laws against smoking
in public places. All restaurants and bars come under the ruling except
those with ventilated smoking rooms. Smokers face steep fines if caught
lighting up. Only 10 percent of Italian restaurants currently have sepa-
rate smoking areas.

$$–$$$
Testaccio
NEAPOLITAN/FISH
In one of the historic cellars of Monte Testaccio — the hill of discarded
pottery shards collected during Emperor Nero’s reign — this restaurant
offers excellent Neapolitan food. The choice of fresh pasta is superb, and
the Sfizietto del Re (a huge portion of linguine with a mountain of shellfish
from the nearby Tirrenian Sea) delights any palate and leaves an ever-
lasting memory after you finish — if you can finish. The other seafood
dishes are excellent as well. This restaurant also makes pizza — the
Neapolitan specialty — but the pasta is much better. If you visit in the
summer, bring a jacket — the place isn’t air-conditioned, but the cellar
maintains an icy temperature inside.
See map p. 122. Via di Monte Testaccio 39. % 06-5783725. Reservations recom-
mended. Metro: Line B to Piramide, but taking a cab is best. Secondi: 15€–30€
($20–$39). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat noon to 2:30 p.m.; Mon–Sat 7–11:30 p.m.
Arcangelo
$$
Prati
ROMAN/CREATIVE ITALIAN/FISH
The chefs at this new restaurant are among those who’ve taken to the
trend of enlivening Italian cuisine with new combinations that Grandma
never imagined. Here, the experiments are subtle and delicious — though
the chefs keep your options open with more traditional offerings, too. The
maccheroni all’amatriciana (pasta in a spicy tomato and bacon sauce) is
excellent, but so are the less usual spaghetti aglio olio e mazzancolle
(spaghetti with garlic, olive oil, and local crayfish), the tonno arrosto con
melanzane (baked tuna with eggplant), and the anatra in salsa di frutta
secca (duck in dried fruit sauce).
See map p. 122. Via G.G. Belli 59, off Via Cicerone, 1 block from Piazza Cavour. % 06-
3210992. Reservations recommended. Bus: 30, 70, 81. Secondi: 13€–21€ ($17–$27).
AE, DC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–10:30 p.m. Closed Aug.

like the lasagna prepared so well here; the tagliatelle alla Bolognese (home-
made pasta with tomato and meat sauce) and the fritto di verdure e agnello

something from the unusually large selection of delicious desserts.

Campo de’ Fiori
ROMAN/FRENCH/MEDITERRANEAN
In this pleasant, informal restaurant, you can relax with some wine and
cheese selected from an extensive list — of both Italian and international
provenance — or have a more substantial meal from the inventive and
somewhat “fusion” menu. Try the charlotte di carciofi con guanciale croc-
cante e pecorino (molded layers of artichokes, bacon and pecorino cheese)
or the abbacchio alla parmigiana (lamb in Parmesan sauce). Bric is a great
stop in the trendy but authentic area of Campo de’ Fiori, a perfect setting
for dinner.

ROMAN/BOLOGNESE
Offering a nice selection of specialties from Rome and Bologna, this restau-
rant is an excellent choice in the residential area north of Via Veneto and
away from the crowds. The food is wonderful — go for the tasting menu of
homemade pastas or the choice of meat dishes. The bollito misto (variety
of boiled meats) is delicious.

Testaccio
ROMAN
An elegant restaurant with a lively atmosphere, Checchino is the best of
several restaurants housed in Monte Testaccio (the Ancient Roman pot-
tery dump) and certainly the most traditional. It serves real Roman spe-
cialties such as lingua con salsa verde (tongue in a green sauce of garlic,
parsley, and olive oil) and the classic coda alla vaccinara (oxtail with pinoli
nuts and raisins), as well as excellent pasta dishes, including penne con
broccoletti strascinati al pecorino romano (short pasta with broccoli rabe

Ethnic dining
“When in Rome do as Romans do” goes the adage, and indeed, you’ll find that although
Rome has become quite cosmopolitan, with residents from around the globe, people
of all nationalities appear to enjoy eating in the local pizzerie and trattorie of old Roman
tradition. Ethnic restaurants are rare and often tucked away in residential neighbor-
hoods out of il centro, and they serve dishes that often have taken on some of the local
culinary culture.
These restaurants are also not cheap, or at least not cheaper than trattorie and
pizzerie. Actually, besides the ubiquitous Chinese restaurants — about one per neigh-
borhood and none to write home about — where you will spend the same as in the
local trattoria, the others are fancy places where Romans go for something special or
exotic, and they have prices to match. Romans love Japanese, which is available at
Hasekura (Via dei Serpenti 27; % 06-483648; open daily) and Hamasei (Via della
Mercede 35; % 06-6792134; closed Mon). Another Asian cuisine with a growing fol-
lowing is Indian, found, for example, at Il Guru (Via Cimarra 4; % 06-4744110; closed
Sun), where you can eat at moderate prices, and the more upscale Surya Mahal
(Piazza Trilussa 50; % 06-5894554; closed Sun).
A few other interesting choices are South American cuisine at Baires (Corso
Rinascimento 1; % 06-6861293; open daily), Caribbean at Macondo (Via Marianna
Dionigi 37; % 06-3212601; closed Sun), Greek at Ouzerie (Via dei Salumi 2; % 06-
5816378; closed Sun; live music Fri and Sat), and French Colonial at Eau Vive (Via
Monterone 86; % 06-68801095; closed Sun). For a taste of “Mittel Europe” and more
moderate prices, try Birreria Viennese (Via della Croce, 21, off Piazza di Spagna;
% 06-6795569; open daily) or Cantina Tirolese (Via Vitelleschi 23, off Castel Sant’Angelo
to the west; % 06-6869994; closed Mon).
Not really an ethnic restaurant, Naturist Club CMI (Via della Vite 14 on the fifth floor;
% 06-6792509; closed Sun) offers organic vegetarian meals with a menu that changes
daily and is more extensive at dinner. Finally, not a restaurant at all but a fast-food
place is Oriental Express (Via Calatafimi 7; % 06-4818791; open daily lunch only),
which serves excellent Arab fare.

at your table. The bombolotti all’amatriciana (pasta in spicy tomato sauce
with bacon) is excellent, and so are the abbacchi scottadito (grilled lamb
chops) and the coda alla vaccinara (oxtail stew). Homemade desserts
round out the menu nicely.

FISH
Don’t expect a written menu and a lot of time to make up your mind in this
informal restaurant; you’ll have to listen to the daily offerings and recom-
mendations of your waiter, and go for it. Don’t worry; you won’t regret it:
The quality of the ingredients and the preparation of the food are out-
standing. The pasta e fagioli con frutti di mare (bean and seafood soup) is
warm and satisfying; the tagliolini alla pescatora (homemade pasta with
seafood), delicate; and the fritto di paranza (fried small fish), delicious.
Also try the grilled daily catch.

Teatro Marcello
JEWISH ROMAN
This famous restaurant has for decades been the destination of Romans
who want to taste some of the specialties of Jewish Roman cuisine. Some
Romans say Giggetto is a little past its prime, but we think it’s still a good
place to sample such specialties as carciofi alla giudia (crispy fried arti-
chokes), as well as traditional Roman dishes such as fettuccine all’amatri-
ciana (pasta with a tomato-and-bacon sauce) and saltimbocca alla romana
(sauteed veal with ham and sage).

Enoteca Capranica

Navona/Pantheon
CREATIVE ITALIAN/WINERY
This elegant historic enoteca (wine bar) is housed in the beautiful Palazzo
Capranica. It offers a wonderful wine list with hundreds of Italian and for-
eign labels, accompanied by creative cuisine, including such flavorful
forays as crudo di spigola di mare agli agrumi con finocchio selvatico (raw
sea bass with citrus fruits and wild fennel) and paccheri di Gragnano con
asparagi, cipollotti e pecorino di fossa (homemade pasta with asparagus,
small onions, and specially aged pecorino cheese). It also has two tasting

A seasonal menu with many interesting flavors served in warm and pictur-
esque surroundings — as well as one of the best wine cellars in Rome —
have made this restaurant a favorite in spite of steepish prices. If it’s on offer,
we recommend the brandade di baccalà con uova di quaglia e fiori di zucca
(salted cod concoction with quail eggs and zucchini flowers) or the mines-
tra di primavera con legumi e quenelle di ricotta di bufala (bean-and-vegetable
soup with buffalo ricotta quenelle, which is sort of like sausages). Leave
room for such desserts as mousse di cioccolato bianco con fragoline di Nemi
(white chocolate mousse with local strawberries). Wine and food are also
offered in the wine bar; the adjacent store sells wine and specialties.

Piazza del Popolo
CREATIVE ITALIAN/PIZZA
If an establishment can be all things to all people, this is it: a restaurant,
an enoteca (wine bar), a pizzeria, a cigar club — and a kitchenware store.
The pasta dishes are tasty — if it’s on the menu, try the carbonara di mac-
cheroncini con fave (carbonara with homemade pasta and fava beans) or
trancio di tonno alla cajun con finocchi e olio di agrumi (Cajun tuna steak
with fennel and citrus oil). As for the pizzas, we are partial to cicoria e
funghi (with dandelion greens and mushrooms). The menu ranges to cous-
cous, wok-prepared Asian dishes, and continental recipes. Popular with
workers during the day and young people at night, the restaurant keeps
late hours. The wine bar in back offers a large choice of drinks, whiskies,

Hostaria da Nerone

Colosseo
ROMAN
This old family trattoria lies near the ruins of Nero’s palace — but you don’t
need the budget of an emperor to enjoy the great view from the terrace
(or the good food). We like it especially for the heartier Roman specialties,
like osso buco (stewed veal shank) and even trippa alla Romana (tripe, with
a light tomato sauce) — an acquired taste.

ROMAN
This old trattoria is decorated like a country tavern, with beamed ceilings
and rustic decorations — the kind of place Romans like to visit on a week-
end outing. If you’re visiting the nearby catacombs, of course, it’s very con-
venient. The hearty Roman fare includes vitello alla massenzio (veal with
mushrooms, artichokes, and olives), tagliatelle al ragu di scorfano (home-
made pasta with tomato sauce and rockfish), grilled meats, and homemade
gnocchi on Thursday — the traditional day for making this Roman potato-
dumpling dish.

Il Convivio Troiani
$$$–$$$$
Navona/Pantheon
CREATIVE ROMAN
This is the best restaurant in Rome, provided that what you’re after is
excellent food and not magical ambience — the exclusive and lavish La
Pergola (reviewed later in this chapter) is unforgettable, but here, you get
better value: You’ll spend half as much and get superb cuisine. Chef Angelo
Troiani concocts wonderful and innovative combinations of traditional
ingredients as his own rendition of great Roman classics. The menu varies,
but you’ll probably find the intriguing and delicious sorbetto di pomodoro
(tomato savory sherbet) and the excellent saltimbocca alla Romana (thin
slices of veal with bacon and sage). Leave enough room for dessert,
because the desserts are fabulous — one of us still dreams of the ginger

Campo de’ Fiori

The subdued atmosphere of Drappo is a perfect setting for serious cuisine
at moderate prices. The malloreddus con vongole pomodorini e basilico
(homemade pasta with clams, cherry tomatoes, and basil) and the fettuc-
cine con fiori di zucca (homemade pasta with zucchini flowers) contain
wonderful bursts of flavors. Other typical dishes are maialino al mirto
(suckling pig) and anatra alle mele (duck with apples).

Il Matriciano

San Pietro
ROMAN
This family-run restaurant is a wonderful place to eat outside in summer,
but you must have a reservation, because it’s well known and popular. The
name reflects one of the specialties, bucatini all’Amatriciana (bucatini is a
kind of thick spaghetti with a hollow center). You can also find excellent
versions of other typical specialties of Roman cuisine, such as abbacchio
al forno (roasted lamb).

La Casina Valadier
$$$–$$$$
Piazza del Popolo
CREATIVE ROMAN
Beautifully located by the Pincio, one of the most romantic spots of Rome,
this elegant restaurant offers great views, sophisticated service, and sur-
prisingly good food. Closed for decades, this early-19th-century building
opened its doors again after 23 months of restoration to an expectant
Roman audience, which had grown up with memories of this chic hot spot
of the era of La Dolce Vita. On the first floor, you’ll find a wine bar (not yet
open at press time); on the second floor, a bar with a terrace; on the third
floor, a large restaurant; and in the fourth-floor tower, an even more exclu-
sive restaurant with a famous panoramic terrace. The menu is simpler at
lunch than dinner; you may find ricotta infornata con pesto di olive e pis-
tacchi (warm ricotta with olive-and-pistachio-nut pesto), fricelli alle erbe
con ragout d’anatra e funghi porcini (homemade green pasta with a duck

zane al timo (lamb cutlets with thyme eggplant puree). For dessert, try
one — or several — of the specialty sherbets.

La Pergola
$$$$
Monte Mario
CREATIVE ITALIAN
No doubt about it, this restaurant, located inside the Rome Cavalieri Hilton
on the Monte Mario (a steep hill overlooking Prati), is a hike. There’s also
no doubt that it’s one of the best restaurants in Italy. The site is breath-
taking, with the whole panorama of Rome laid out at your feet, and the ele-
gance of the furnishings and the professionalism of the service — both
kind and discreet — add even more to the experience. Chef Heinz Beck, a
master of Italian cuisine, is known for concocting unexpected combina-
tions, such as tortellini verdi con vongole e calamaretti (green tortellini with
clams and squid) and triglia su ragout di carciofi (red mullet served over a

Trevi
ABRUZZESE/ROMAN
Opening into a courtyard-size square shared with another restaurant — Il
Chianti — the Taverna is a great spot to dine outdoors in nice weather.
Given its location, you’d expect one of those touristy prix-fixe places, but
Romans love the center as much as visitors do, and this restaurant has so
far maintained its standards. The food is good traditional Abruzzese and
Roman, with a variety of delicious homemade pastas, abbacchio (lamb
roast), and a choice of grilled meats.

ROMAN/CREATIVE ITALIAN
This restaurant is in the Palazzo della Rovere (which also houses the Hotel
Columbus; see Chapter 9), and when the weather is fine, you can dine in
one of Rome’s nicest garden courtyards. But the draw is not just location;

it’s also the interesting and even surprising cuisine. In addition to the piatti
della storia (dishes made from recipes from Renaissance Rome), La
Veranda has branched out into experiments like ravioli al rosmarino e cav-
alfiore con ragout di tonno (ravioli with rosemary and cauliflower with a
tuna ragout). Even more adventurous is the dessert millefoglie con melan-
zane al ciccolato — a napoleon with eggplant and chocolate, which works,
strangely enough.

Pantheon
ROMAN
This clean, bright, nouveau trattoria has great food, including excellent
pastas and wines, and a wonderful location only steps from the Pantheon
but out of the hubbub. The focus is on pasta, and it specializes in tradi-
tional Roman recipes, among which the gricia (sautéed bacon and onions
and pecorino cheese) is queen. The trattoria also has a few secondi, includ-
ing excellent steaks, and we recommend the contorni (vegetables) and the
appetizers, including excellent cold cuts and cheese. The house wine is
very good.

Colosseo
ROMAN
This is a traditional Roman restaurant, with large dining rooms to accom-
modate feasting Romans on weekends and for special occasions, and
cozier ones for everyday eating; it has a terrace for use in the good season.
The food is well prepared and, of course, traditional; the service is atten-
tive. Besides a comprehensive menu, you’ll find daily specials: the tradi-
tional Roman ones of gnocchi (potato dumplings) on Thursdays, baccalà
(salted cod) and chickpea soup on Fridays, and so on.

FISH
Looking rather nondescript from the outside — if anything, a bit touristy —
this restaurant is a hidden pearl where you can taste excellent fish dishes
accompanied by fine wines. To a comfortable interior, it adds in the good
season a small and pleasant terrace. The four tasting menus are definitely
recommended and include a satisfying selection of dishes following one of
four themes: Traditional Roman, fish, meat, or the restaurant’s own recipe
(called al Presidente). The menu changes often, but you might find the won-
derful fettuccine con calamaretti bottarga e pomodori (homemade pasta with
squid, fish roe, and fresh tomatoes) or the exquisite millefoglie di pesce e
verdure (fish and vegetable napoleon).

ROMAN/SICILIAN
A traditional Roman restaurant with some Sicilian influence, Quirino’s
focus is on seafood — for example, fritto di paranza (mixed, deep-fried
small fish and calamari), which is made to perfection. The seafood also
gets worked into the homemade fresh pasta dishes, such as the classic
spaghetti alle vongole (spaghetti with clams) or the more venturesome
tagliatelle ai porcini e alle vongole (fresh pasta with porcini mushrooms
and clams). A variety of grilled fish, meat, and vegetarian pastas completes
the menu. For dessert, you can’t go wrong with the homemade cannoli
(sweet ricotta-filled tubes).

ROMAN
This family-run restaurant — created by the sister of the famous Roman
actor Aldo Fabrizi and run today by his son and grandsons — was already
a Roman institution, but with the recent renovations both in the dining room
and on the menu, it has won new admirers. The gnocchi are superb, and
complementing the solid traditional menu are many new dishes, such as the
delicious polpettine al vino (small meatballs in a wine sauce). Tasting menus

CREATIVE SICILIAN
This pleasant, lively restaurant may have a generic name, but names can
be deceptive. You can have your aperitivo (predinner drink) on the first
floor with a choice of savory — and delicious — tidbits and then move
upstairs to your table for dinner. The new chef is Sicilian, and so is the
menu, including many classics and a number of original creations. Among
the classics, the caponata (sautée of cubed eggplants with pinoli nuts and
raisins) is a standout, as is the pasta alla Norma. The other offerings
change, but you might find scottata di capesante con verdurine (sautée of
scallops and vegetables). Do not miss the desserts: delicious baby cannoli
(sweet ricotta filled tubes) and the cassata (a sweet Sicilian ricotta con-
coction covered with a thin layer of almond paste). The wine list includes
wine by the glass.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Americans may be surprised to discover that fast food was invented in
Rome more than 2,000 years ago: Street food was sold at carts and small
shops in the Forum, and a quick bite to eat could be had at any caupona
(the Ancient Roman word for eatery), standing or perched on a high
stool at the counter. Although times have changed, you’ll see many
Romans still doing the same — having a sandwich standing up in a bar
or eating a square of pizza from a take-away rosticceria. Here is the low-
down on Roman fast food — quite different, as you’ll see, from what
you’re used to.
Bars
Roman cafes are called bars; they rarely have more than a few seats and
do most of their business at the counters — also because there is a sur-
charge for sitting down. Romans basically live in the bar during the day.
This is where they come for breakfast before going to work, espresso
and cornetto (sweet croissant, often filled with cream or jam) being the
typical fare; for coffee break; and for lunch. They return in the evening
for aperitivo, a predinner drink (with or without alcohol) accompanied
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 133

by small tidbits to eat. For lunch, bars prepare a large variety of sand-
wiches. The rosetta is the typical Roman bread roll, which can be filled
with frittata (omelet), mozzarella and tomatoes, or cheese and cold 
cuts; the tramezzino is slices of crustless American-style bread filled
with a variety of mayo-based salads; and the pizza Romana — often our
preferred — is a square of savory focaccia filled with ham and cheese,
which can be eaten cold or warmed up. Many bars also double as ice
cream parlors. For some of the trendiest bars, see Chapter 16, but any
bar will provide a basic, good-quality breakfast or lunch.
Picnics
In fine weather, a nice, inexpensive option — and one greatly favored by
children — is to get some sandwiches and head to one of Rome’s great
public parks, such as Villa Borghese or the Gianicolo (see Chapter 11),
and have a picnic; even smaller neighborhood parks are a good option.
Keep in mind, however, that sitting on public fountains and monuments
to have your lunch is forbidden, and you’ll be asked to move. You may
even be heavily fined if you’re found littering.
An excellent place to buy farm-fresh food for your picnic is the Fattoria
la Parrina (Largo Toniolo 3, between Piazza Navona and the Pantheon;
% 06-68300111), which offers wonderful farm bread, cold cuts, cheese,
wine, and veggies, all organically produced on its farm in nearby south-
ern Tuscany. Another good place is L’Antico Forno di Piazza Trevi (Via
delle Muratte 8; % 06-6792866), selling one of the best pizza bianca
(focaccia) in Rome, as well as a large variety of bread, cheese, cold cuts,
olives, and wine to go with it. This is an old-fashioned grocer, the ances-
tor of supermarkets, where you can find everything — including sodas,
cookies, and paper napkins — to round out your picnic. If you don’t like
the idea of preparing your own sandwiches, pick up some already made
or some hot pizza to go from one of the places described in the “Pizza a
taglio” section, below.
Pizza a taglio
The single most common snack for Romans — and one that all kids
seem to love — is a square of pizza from one of the ubiquitous hot-pizza
counters around Rome. These joints — usually a glass counter with a
few ovens in the background — bake pizza all day long (usually Mon–Sat
8 a.m.–8 p.m.) in large, oblong, metal pans, with a variety of toppings,
from the simple rossa (tomato and oregano) and bianca (focaccia) to 
con i funghi (mushrooms with tomato sauce or with cheese), con la moz-
zarella (tomato and mozzarella), con le patate (with thin slices of crispy
potatoes), and ripiena (filled with ham and cheese). Some of the fancier
places will have a larger variety, but novelty is not necessarily a sign of
quality; look instead for steaming-hot pans, which means that they sell
so much, they have to prepare new pizzas often. (At the best places,
you’ll see Romans waiting for the next slab of their favorite flavor to roll
out.) Good addresses are too many to list, and many of the best don’t
Part III: Settling into Rome 
134

even have names, but here are a few of our favorites: Pizza (Via del
Leoncino 28; % 06-6867757), Pizza a Taglio (Via della Frezza 40; % 06-
3227116), Pizza (Via della Penna 14; % 06-7234596), Pizza Rustica (Via del
Portico d’Ottavia, % 06-6879262; and Via dei Pastini 116, % 06-6782468),
Il Tempio del Buongustaio (Piazza del Risorgimento 50; % 06-6833709),
Pizza Al Taglio (Via Cavour 307; % 06-6784042), and Pizzabuona (Corso
Vittorio Emanuele II 165; % 06-6893229).
Pizzerie
For a fast — and cheaper — lunch or dinner without giving up on the
pleasure of sitting down to a good table, Romans choose a pizzeria.
These are simple restaurants specializing in pizza — strictly individual-
size, round pizzas — and go from the more fancy (with tablecloths and
fashionable dining rooms) to the more rustic (a piece of paper on a
wooden table). They offer pizza with a variety of established toppings,
most of which have been defined by name in a longstanding tradition,
such as margherita (tomato and mozzarella), napoletana (tomato, moz-
zarella, and anchovies), capricciosa (tomato, mozzarella, mushrooms,
artichoke hearts, olives, ham, and an egg), and funghi (mushrooms,
tomato, and mozzarella). You’ll also find more-modern and sometimes
original combinations on the menu, such as rugola, bresaola, e parmi-
giano (fresh arugula and thin slices of cured beef and Parmesan cheese
on a simple tomato sauce), quattro formaggi (four kinds of cheese), broc-
coletti e salsicce (broccoli rabe and Italian sausages), and so on. In addi-
tion, pizzerie typically serve a choice of savory and delicious appetizers,
starting with bruschetta (toasted peasant-style bread topped with oil and
garlic and, on request, tomatoes, olives, ham, and so on), but also supplì
(rice balls stuffed with a small piece of mozzarella and deep fried), filetti
di baccalà (deep-fried salt cod), olive ascolane (large green olives stuffed
with meat and cheese and then deep fried), and fiori di zucca (zucchini
flowers stuffed with a small piece of anchovy and mozzarella and then
deep fried). If you like filetti di baccalà, the best in Rome are fried at
Filetti di Baccalà (Largo dei Librari 88, off Via dei Giubbonari at Campo
de’ Fiori; % 06-6864018; open Mon–Sat dinner only), a small restaurant
where you can take out or sit down — it also serves a few contorni and
desserts, but lines are epic.
For real Neapolitan pizza that has received the seal of honor from the
organization that guards the quality of Neapolitan pizza (a bit like D.O.C.
for wine), try Al Forno della Soffitta 1 (Via Piave 62; % 06-42011164)
and Al Forno della Soffitta 2 (Via dei Villini, 1/f; % 06-4404642; closed
Sun) or Pizza Re (Via di Ripetta 14; % 06-3211468; closed Sun). The
pizza is also excellent at the elegant Il Regno di Napoli (Via Romagna 
22; % 06-4745025; closed Sat–Sun lunch only), which is also a full-scale
restaurant and therefore a bit more expensive, and at Pizza Forum (Via
San Giovanni in Laterano 34; % 06-7002515), with large and modern
dining rooms and fast service.
For Roman-style pizza (thinner than the Neapolitan version and less
bready but more savory), try Baffetto (Via del Governo Vecchio 114; 
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 135

% 06-6861617); Ivo (Via di San Francesco a Ripa 158; % 06-5817082;
closed Tues); or Opera (Via del Leone 23; % 06-68809927), which offers
30 types of pizza.
Really good coffee
Even if you’re on the go, the proper way to finish a meal is with a good
coffee — at least that’s what Romans believe. Note, however, that many
smaller trattorie and pizzerias don’t make coffee. What better reason 
to remove to a famous coffee shop after your meal? If you’re a coffee 
aficionado, you should not miss the Caffè Sant’Eustachio (Piazza
Sant’Eustachio 82; % 06-68802048; Bus: Minibus 116), a traditional
Italian bar that has been serving Rome’s best espresso since 1938, made
with water still carried into the city on the Ancient Roman aqueduct.
Another excellent temple of coffee is Tazza d’Oro, just by the Pantheon
(% 06-6789792; Bus: Minibus 116 to Pantheon); its coffee is very good,
and you haven’t lived until you’ve tried its granita di caffè (a concoction
of frozen espresso served with whipped cream).
Snack bars, tavola calda, and rosticcerie
A delicate nuance differentiates each of these typical Roman fast-food
eateries. They correspond to your local diner or deli — if not in look and
kind of food served, at least in purpose. This is where you can have a
simple lunch at a fraction of the price you would pay in a restaurant and
where harrassed working parents and singles who don’t feel like cook-
ing come for takeout in the evening. They present the food behind glass
counters and sell it by weight or by the piece. Sometimes, they’re organ-
ized as cafeterias, and you take your food on a tray to a sitting place;
others have only standing room at a counter and are mostly takeout.
Snack bars usually have fewer offerings than a tavola calda, and rostic-
cerie focus on roasted chickens and pizza, although often with an array
of side dishes. Some are obviously better than others, and although in
the simplest snack bar, you’ll find little more than sandwiches, in the
best tavola calda, you’ll have an ample choice of tasty and well-prepared
hot and cold dishes, including pasta, secondi, and contorni — in short, 
all you need for a full meal. Always look carefully at the food before
ordering to check that it isn’t dried out; in mediocre places, you’ll be
much worse off than at the local bar, where sandwiches are usually
freshly prepared. The clientele will also help you: Crowds at mealtime
(especially Romans) are an excellent sign.
Midway between a snack bar and a restaurant, Grillpoint (Piazzale di
Porta Pia 122; % 06-44236435; open daily noon to 2:30 p.m.) provides
an elegant dining room and a wide choice of well-prepared dishes,
including pizza. Da Maciste al Salario, Pizza, Vino e Cucina (Via Salaria
179/a, at Via Metauro; % 06-8848267; closed Mon dinner and Sun lunch)
serves its excellent food cafeteria style and provides ample seating.
There is a long line for lunch, and if you arrive too late, the best will be
gone. In il centro, there’s the crowded Taverna del Campo snack stop
with crostini, panini, and beer (Campo de’ Fiori 16; % 06-6874402).

Sweet endings: Gelato
Italian ice cream (gelato) is among the best in the world and has nothing
to do with what is often called in America “Italian ice.” It is creamy with-
out being heavy, and even the fruit flavors have little in common with 
icy sherbet. Serious gelato comes in a variety of flavors and is sold by
the size of the cone or cup you choose. It’s served with a special spatula
and not by the ball; hence, you can have up to three flavors even in the
smallest size. Romans like to top it with whipped cream, so you’ll be
asked if you care for panna or not; our answer is usually “Yes, plenty!”
Flavors are divided between frutta (fruit) — limone (lemon), arancio
(orange), melone (melon), pesca (peach), mora (blackberry), frutti di
bosco (mixed wild berries), the list is endless — and creme (creams).
The best cream flavors for us are zabaglione (a rum-and-egg combo,
reminiscent of eggnog), bacio (hazelnut chocolate), and stracciatella
(vanilla with chocolate chips), but even plain crema (egg cream) and
cioccolato (chocolate) can be fabulous when well prepared.
You’ll see prepackaged, commercial gelati, which you can choose from
the signs nailed on the wall or pasted on the cooler where they’re sold.
Although any bar will have the prepackaged kind in a white cooler some-
where inside, unless you’re dying for any old ice cream now, wait to find
a bar that also says GELATERIA outside, and look for the sign PRODUZIONE
PROPRIA: It means they make their own ice cream, and it will be fresh and
delicious.
The oldest gelato parlor in Rome is Giolitti (Via Uffici del Vicario 40; 
% 06-699-1243; Bus: Minibus 116), which offers a huge selection of 
flavors — the fruit and chocolate flavors are excellent. The second-oldest
is the Palazzo del Freddo di G. Fassi (Via Principe Eugenio 65; % 06-
4464740; Metro: Piazza Vittorio). In Trastevere, try the Gelateria alla
Scala (Via della Scala 5; % 06 5813174; Tram: 8), for rich homemade
ice cream that could almost be described as pungent. Near Campo de’
Fiori, go to Pica (Via della Seggiola 12, off Via Arenula; % 06-68803275;
Tram: 8), which prepares one of the best ice creams in Rome. Near
the Fontana di Trevi, the Gelateria Trevi (Via del Lavatore 84–85; % 06-
6792060; Bus: 116 or 492) serves a nicely sized, good ice cream, and there
is the famous Il Gelato di S. Crispino (Via della Panetteria 42; % 06-
6793924), for gourmet ice cream served in small cups (exclusively — no
cones) and prepared with the freshest fruits — often uncommon ones,
such as the susina (a local fruit between a plum and a litche) — and rang-
ing to the outright extravagant, such as funghi (mushrooms), which is 
surprisingly tasty.
On the light side, Romans love a sort of frappe/shake/smoothie made
with real fresh yogurt and fruit. The refreshment is served in several
bars, but you can find some of Rome’s best at Yogobar, with several
locations, including Via Lucania 23, off Via Boncompagni, near Via
Veneto (% 06-42883001; Bus: Minibus 116), and Viale Regina Margherita
83b, off Via Nomentana to the west (% 06-8551374; Bus: 63 or tram 3).

Part IV
Exploring Rome

In this part . . .
W
hether you’re an architecture buff, an amateur archae-
ologist, an art aﬁcionado, a devout Catholic, or simply
a lover of the world’s great cities, you’ll be delighted with all
that the Eternal City has to offer. In this part, we tell you about
Rome’s best attractions, both inside and outside the city walls.
Rome is a veritable “who’s who” of famous monuments,
museums, and ruins, and we cover them all in Chapter 11,
along with tips on how best to enjoy them. And although
Rome isn’t as well known for fashion and shopping as some
other Italian cities, it has some fabulous shopping areas spe-
cializing in Roman- and Italian-made goods, which we tell you
about in Chapter 12. In Chapter 13, we’ve done some of your
planning ahead of time, putting together a choice of the ﬁve
best itineraries you can take, depending on your interests.
And although it has been said that even a lifetime is not enough
to visit Rome, in Chapter 14 we suggest ﬁve side trips — easy
excursions from Rome to unique sights as absorbing as the
great city itself.

Chapter 11
Discovering Rome’s 
Best Attractions
In This Chapter
 Exploring Rome’s most famous attractions
 Enjoying the Vatican’s artistic riches
 Checking out other fun things to see and do
 Taking a guided tour
T
he seven hills of Rome have been continuously inhabited for the past
3,000 years or so, resulting in a melting pot that laid the foundation
for a cosmopolitan European culture, of which Rome remained the heart
for centuries and in which it still plays a central role. The Vatican — the
small city-state that is the official seat of the Catholic faith — still leads
the Catholic world from its location in the center of the city.
With such a history, it’s not surprising that nowhere else will you find
such a cultural density and layering of periods and styles. For instance,
the 913 churches in Rome’s il centro range in period from the 8th to the
18th century, many lavishly decorated with masterpieces. The Vatican is
a vast complex of museums, apartments, chapels, and gardens filled with
artistic riches. What’s more, the Papal Jubilee in 2000 was the impetus to
make many much-needed renovations to the entire city, as well as efforts
to reduce congestion and pollution. These changes have had a big impact
on the city, and ever-increasing numbers of appreciative tourists are
pouring in.
The Eternal City may have an exalted history, but Rome is no lifeless
museum of the past. A couple million people live and work in this place,
where the thoroughfares were designed for chariots instead of cabs.
Romans walk on ruins from the days of Caesar, turn along the same
alleyways trod by masters of the Renaissance, and thrill to the same
lighted fountains that were reflected in the eyes of Fellini’s beautiful
debauchers.
Rome wasn’t built in a day or even a millennium, so don’t think you can
see it all in a day: Set aside several days to do the city right.

For a service fee of 1.50€ ($1.95), you can make reservations for a
number of attractions — and even buy your tickets online — by contact-
ing Pierreci (% 06-39967700; www.pierreci.it), the official agency
that manages reservations for many Roman attractions. Pierreci will send
you a voucher by e-mail, and you pick up your tickets at a special desk
directly at the attraction entrance, skipping the waiting line. Pierreci’s
hours are Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 5 p.m.
The official agent for reservations and tickets for other attractions —
such as the Galleria Borghese — is Ticketeria (% 06-32810; Fax: 06-
32651329; www.ticketeria.it). Just as with Pierreci, Ticketeria sends
you a voucher by e-mail, and you pick up your tickets at a special loca-
tion at the attraction entrance, thereby avoiding lines.
The Vatican is a separate state, and you make reservations for the attrac-
tions there at its visitor office (see “The Vatican,” later in this chapter).
To accommodate its tourists, the city of Rome continues to expand
opening hours for museums and other attractions, especially during 
holidays and the summer months. Check with a local tourist office for
changes that may occur during your visit (see Chapter 8 for locations).

Don’t pass up these deals
If you’re planning to do a lot of sightseeing in Rome, you may want to purchase discount
cards offered by various museums and attractions.
The four branches of the Museo Nazionale Romano (National Roman Museum) —
Palazzo Altemps, Palazzo Massimo, Terme di Diocleziano, and Cripta Balbi — offer a
three-day pass good for a single visit to each of the sights; it costs 7€ ($9), a savings
of 10€ ($13), and is sold at each of the four branches.
The complex of the Musei Capitolini (Capitoline Museums) also offers a cumulative
ticket; it is valid seven days and includes admission to the two Capitoline Museums,
in addition to the Tabularium and the Centrale Montemartini, for 9.90€ ($13), a savings
of 5.20€ ($6.80).
The Park of the Appia Antica also offers a cumulative ticket to visit its major monu-
ments; 6€ ($8) gets you into the Baths of Caracalla, the Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella,
and the Villa of the Quintili. The pass is valid for seven days, and you can purchase it
from any of the three sites.
If you’re planning an extensive visit of Ancient Rome, the best deal is the seven-day Roma
Archeologia Card: for 20€ ($26), you can access the four sites of the National Roman
Museum(Palazzo Altemps, Palazzo Massimo, Terme di Diocleziano, and Cripta Balbi) and
the three paying sites of the Appian Way (the Baths of Caracalla, the Mausoleum of
Cecilia Metella, and the Villa of the Quintili), plus the Colosseum and the Palatino. You can
purchase card at the participating sites (except for the Via Appia locations) or at the
main Visitor Center of the Tourist Board of Rome (APT), at Via Parigi 5 (% 06-36004399).

To fully appreciate the Roman Forum, the Colosseum, and other ruins,
pick up a copy of the small book Rome Past and Present, sold in book-
stores or at stands near the Forum for approximately 10€ ($13). 
Its plastic overleaves show you how Rome looked 2,000 years ago.
Rome’s Top Sights
Where do you begin? If you’re an archaeology buff, Rome’s ancient
sights could keep you going for days, weeks, months, and even years.
But the city is also loaded with famous museums, impressive monu-
ments, and awe-inspiring churches. In this treasure trove of possibilities,
you have to make some decisions. The sights in this section are our
roster of the most important Roman attractions. For their locations,
see the “Rome Attractions” map on p. 148.
Remember that as a rule, ticket booths close half an hour to an hour
before the stated closing time of a given attraction.
Rome’s attractions tend to be busy at any time of day or year, crowded
with both foreign and local visitors. April and May are the worst for the
large groups of schoolchildren who flock into Rome from all over the
world for their field trips; June and July are almost as bad for the huge
numbers of tourists from everywhere. If you want to avoid throngs of
people, the best time of year to visit is from late January to early March,
when the bad weather keeps tourist crowds at bay. In general, weekends
tend to be uncrowded in summer, when most locals head for the beach;
weekdays are a good choice the rest of the year, when locals are at work.
Mondays are tricky, because most galleries and some museums are closed,
so people flock to those other attractions that remain open. Usually,
early morning, lunch recess, and late evening are good times to visit;
midmorning and midafternoon are the peak visiting hours.
For the Capella Sistina (Sistine Chapel) and Basilica di San Pietro
(St. Peter’s Basilica), see “The Vatican,” later in this chapter.
Musei Capitolini (Capitoline Museums)
Teatro Marcello
The Capitoline Museums are housed in the two palaces — Palazzo Nuovo
and Palazzo dei Conservatori — that open onto the beautiful Piazza del
Campidoglio, designed by Michelangelo. The oldest public collections in
the world, the museums hold a treasury of ancient sculpture and an impor-
tant collection of European paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries.
Among the masterpieces of the museums is the original second-century
bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. (The one you see standing
in the middle of the square is a copy.) The statue was saved only because
early Christians thought it was the first Christian emperor, Constantine.
The Palazzo Nuovo houses the famous Capitoline Venus and such other
famous sculptures as the Dying Gaul, a Roman copy of a Greek original,

and The Amazons (under restoration at press time), two statues of female
warriors that were originally in Hadrian’s Villa in Tivoli (see Chapter 14).
In the courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori are the much-photographed
dismembered pieces of an ancient 40-foot statue of Constantine II — huge
head, hands, foot, kneecap, and so on. Inside the Palazzo dei Conservatori,
you find the famous Lupa Capitolina, the wolf suckling Romulus and
Remus, a fifth-century-B.C. bronze that is the symbol of Rome. Another
famous work is the bronze of the boy removing a thorn from his foot.
Children, including toddlers, are often drawn to these two sculptures —
our 2-year-old was particularly fascinated by the bronze of the boy. On the
top floor is the Pinacoteca Capitolina (picture gallery), a superb collec-
tion including such famous paintings as Caravaggio’s Fortune Teller and
John the Baptist; Titian’s Baptism of Christ; and works by Veronese,
Rubens, and others.
Between the Palazzo Nuovo and the Palazzo dei Conservatori, bordering
Piazza del Campidoglio to the south, is the Palazzo Senatorio (Senatorial
Palace). This palace was used for administrative purposes until recently,
when it was included in the Capitoline Museums to provide additional
exposition space and show the results of the recent excavations under-
neath it. The palace was built in the Middle Ages over the Tabularium, an
imposing Roman building that housed the public archives of the Roman
Republic. The Tabularium was built of massive stone blocks with Doric
columns in the facade. You can clearly see its remains from the Forum (3 of
the original 11 arcades remain). It’s now part of the museum complex, and
its admission is included in the ticket.
You can spend several hours in these museums if you want an in-depth
visit, but you can see the highlights in three hours or less, depending on
your interests.

Castel Sant’Angelo (St. Angelo Castle)
San Pietro
This “castle” is a perfect example of practical Roman reuse: It began as a
mausoleum to house the remains of Emperor Hadrian and other important
Romans, later became a fortress, and is now a museum. Built in A.D. 123, it
may have been incorporated into the city’s defenses as early as 403; it was
attacked by the Goths (one of the barbarian tribes that pillaged Rome in its
decline) in 537. Later, the popes used it as a fortress and hideout, and, for
convenience, connected it to the Vatican palace by an elevated corridor —
which you can still see near Borgo Pio, stretching between St. Peter’s and
the castle. Castel Sant’Angelo houses a museum of arms and armor; you
can also visit the elegant papal apartments from the Renaissance, as well
as the horrible cells in which political prisoners were kept (among them
sculptor Benvenuto Cellini). Count about three hours for a full visit.

Catacombe di San Callisto (Catacombs of San Callisto)
Park of Appia Antica
Although there are several places to visit the catacombs in Rome (includ-
ing the catacombs of St. Sebastian at Via Appia Antica 136, % 06-7850350,
and those of Ste. Domitilla, Via delle Sette Chiese 282; % 06-5110342,
www.catacombe.domitilla.it), the catacombs of St. Callisto are among
the most impressive, with 20km (121⁄2 miles) of tunnels and galleries under-
ground, and organized on several levels. (It’s cold down there at 18m/60 ft.,
so bring a sweater.) The catacombs began as quarries outside Ancient
Rome where travertine marble and the dirt used in cement were dug. Early
Christians, however, hid out, held mass, and buried their dead in the cata-
combs. The Catacombs of St. Callixtus (Callixtus III was an early pope, elected
in 217) have four levels, including a crypt of several early popes and the
tomb where St. Cecilia’s remains were found. Some of the original paintings
and decoration are still intact and show that Christian symbolism —
doves, anchors, and fish — was already well developed. You can tour the
catacombs in about one hour.

Terme di Caracalla (Baths of Caracalla)
Aventino
Built by the Roman Emperor Caracalla, these baths were completed in A.D.
216 and operated until 537. They are the best-preserved large thermal
baths in Rome, with some of the internal decoration still visible, making it
possible to imagine what it must have been like: richly decorated with
enormous columns, hundreds of statues, colored marble or mosaic floors,
and marble or stucco and frescoes on the walls. The baths in Roman times
were much more than just a place to wash; people also came here to relax
and to exercise. After entering the building from the porticos on the north-
east side, Romans would access the dressing rooms and then could move
through the deep-cleansing area, a sort of sauna similar to Turkish baths,
starting in the calidarium (hot room) and proceeding to the tepidarium
(first cooling down), the frigidarium (complete cooling down), and natatio
(swimming pool). The baths also house two gymnasiums (exercise rooms),
where trainers used to be on duty, and gardens for reading and relaxing.
Plan to spend about an hour here.

Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 151

Colosseo or Anfiteatro Flavio (Colosseum)
Colosseo
The Colosseum, along with St. Peter’s Basilica, is Rome’s most recogniza-
ble monument. However, “Colosseum” isn’t its official name. Begun under
the Flavian Emperor Vespasian, it was named the Amphiteatrum Flavium
and was finished in A.D. 80. The nickname came from the colossal statue of
Nero that was erected nearby in the second century A.D. Estimates are that
the Colosseum could accommodate up to 73,000 spectators. The enter-
tainment included fights between gladiators and battles with wild animals.
In the labyrinth of chambers beneath the original wooden floor of the
Colosseum, deadly weapons, vicious beasts, and gladiators were prepared
for the mortal combats. (Contrary to popular belief, the routine feeding of
Christians to lions is a legend.) The Colosseum was damaged by fires and
earthquakes, and eventually abandoned; it was then used as a marble
quarry for the monuments of Christian Rome until Pope Benedict XV con-
secrated it in the 18th century. Next to the Colosseum is the Arch of
Constantine, built in 315 to commemorate the emperor’s victory over the
pagan Maxentius in 312. Pieces from other monuments were reused, so
Constantine’s monument includes carvings honoring Marcus Aurelius,
Trajan, and Hadrian.
In the summer of 2000, for the first time in centuries, the Colosseum was
brought to life again with performances under the aegis of the Estate
Romana (see Chapters 2 and 15); now it also houses special exhibitions.
We strongly recommend that you reserve your tickets to avoid the long
lines; you can do so at the number or Web site in the following listing infor-
mation. Plan to spend about an hour here.

Domus Aurea (Golden House)
Colosseo
The complex of Domus Aurea (Golden House) was the brainchild of the
infamous Emperor Nero. Built after the great fire of A.D. 64 (which is tradi-
tionally but perhaps incorrectly blamed on him), it once covered more
than 200 acres, with buildings scattered over a park landscaped to look
like romantic countryside with an artificial lake, pastures, and vineyards.
The lavishly decorated main reception building — the Golden House
itself — was abandoned after Nero’s fall in 68 and buried under the ther-
mal baths of the emperors Titus and Trajan. Completely forgotten, it was
stumbled upon in the 18th century when Romans digging in the “hill”
across from the Colosseum found caves that turned out to be ceilings of
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
152

ancient rooms decorated with Roman frescoes. Only since 2000, however,
have tourists been allowed to visit these cavernous spaces, some of which
still show the elegant interior paintings that decorated the walls. Often
done in red tones, they tend to show mythological scenes surrounded by
fine traceries and flourishes, of which you can see some fragments. Note:
You need to reserve a ticket at the number or Web site in the following list-
ing information. The visit lasts about an hour.

Galleria Borghese (Borghese Gallery)
Parioli
The Galleria Borghese is housed in the splendid building inside the Villa
Borghese (now a large public park; see “Finding More Cool Things to See
and Do,” later in this chapter) that Cardinal Scipione Borghese created in
1613 for his art collection. Closed for restoration for 13 years, the building
and site are now an attraction in themselves; the art inside is probably the
most stunning smaller collection on view in Italy. The ground floor focuses
on sculpture, including Canova’s sensual reclining Paulina Borghese as
Venus Victrix (Paulina was Napoleon’s sister) and breathtaking marble
carvings by the young Gian Lorenzo Bernini. His David, captured in the
middle of a slingshot windup, is full of charmingly boyish concentration;
Apollo and Daphne freezes in marble the moment when Daphne turns
into a laurel tree, her fingers bursting into leaves and bark enveloping her
legs. In the Rape of Proserpine, a sculpture Bernini executed in collabo-
ration with his father, the god’s fingers uncannily seem to press into her
marble flesh. The extensive painting collection contains many master-
pieces: Caravaggio’s haunting self-portrait as Bacchus and his St. Jerome
Writing, Antonello da Messina’s subtle and mysterious Portrait of a Man,
a young Raphael’s Deposition, and Tiziano’s Sacred and Profane Love.
Andrea del Sarto, Coreggio, Lucas Cranach, Bronzino, Lorenzo Lotto, and
many other artists are also represented in this dazzling display of genius.
The Galleria Borghese can accommodate only so many people, so reser-
vations are required for admission, and your visit must be limited to two
hours. (The astounding number of true masterpieces will make you long
for a second visit.)
See map p. 148. Piazzale del Museo Borghese. % 06-8417645. Reservations required
(call % 06-328101 or visit www.ticketeria.it). Bus: 52, 53, or 910 to Via Pinciana
behind the villa; 490 to Viale San Paolo del Brasile inside the park; or Minibus 116 to
the Galleria Borghese. Metro: Line A to Spagna; take the Villa Borghese exit, and
walk up Viale del Museo Borghese. Admission: 6.50€ ($8.45) plus 2€ ($2.60) booking
fee. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.

Galleria d’Arte Moderna (Gallery of Modern Art)
Parioli
Housed in the beautiful, Liberty-style (Italian Art Nouveau) Palazzo delle
Belle Arti, this important art museum preserves a rich collection of
modern art from the 19th and 20th centuries. Italian artists are largely rep-
resented, but the collection includes works by all sorts of great artists.
The two sections dedicated to the 19th century hold a great selection of
paintings by artists of the Macchiaioli movement and a number of works
by French modern artists such as Rodin, Van Gogh, and Monet, but the
real riches are in the two sections dedicated to the 20th century, where
you can admire a profusion of artwork by De Chirico, Giorgio Morandi,
Marino Marini, Lucio Fontana, and Giò Pomodoro, to name some high-
lights. The collection also includes international names such as Pollock,
Calder, and Tápies, among others. Schedule at least two hours for your
visit. The museum is building a new pavilion nearby — the ex-Caserme
Montello (Via Reni, off Piazza Apollodoro) — to house its 21st-century col-
lection; it is scheduled to open sometime in 2006.

Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini 
(National Art Gallery of Palazzo Barberini)
Via Veneto
Completed in 1633, the Palazzo Barberini is a magnificent example of a
baroque Roman palace. Bernini decorated the rococo apartments in which
the gallery is now housed, and they’re certainly luxurious. Also preserved
in the Palazzo Barberini is the wedding chamber of Princess Cornelia
Costanza Barberini and Prince Giulio Cesare Colonna di Sciarra, exactly as
it was centuries ago. Although the structure itself is an attraction, the col-
lection of paintings that make up the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica is

The etiquette of standing in line
Roman rules for lining up at museums — or even at the ice cream counter, for that
matter — take some getting used to. You may think that people are packed together,
trying to push their way through, but each person is more or less aware of who was
there first. Even if the mass of people doesn’t look like a line, it’s sort of structured like
one. If you want not to be regarded as another one of those pushy and arrogant
Americans, pay attention to who’s already there when you arrive, and be ready to
modify your posture slightly so the person behind you knows that you know when it’s
your turn, and you know that he knows that you know, and so on. (Remember: Body
language is important in Italy!)

most impressive, including Caravaggio’s Narcissus; Tiziano’s Venus and
Adonis; and Raphael’s La Fornarina, a loving, informal portrait of the
bakery girl who was his mistress (and the model for his Madonnas). Other
artists represented are the great Sienese painters Il Sodoma and Simone
Martini, and also Filippo Lippi. The galleria’s decorative-arts collection
contains not only Italian pieces, but also fine imported objects, including
some from Japan. In addition to the permanent collections, the gallery reg-
ularly houses special exhibits. Two-and-a-half hours should be enough for
a complete visit.

visit to the apartments in advance at % 06-328101. Metro: Barberini. Admission: 5€
($6.50). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia (National 
Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia)
Parioli
This splendid papal villa, built by the most prominent architects of the
16th century, houses the world’s most important Etruscan collection.
Originally from Asia Minor, the Etruscans were a mysterious people who
dominated Tuscany and Lazio, including Rome, up to the fifth century B.C.
Many of the objects in this museum came from Cerveteri, an important
Etruscan site northwest of Rome. One of the most spectacular objects is
the bride-and-bridegroom sarcophagus from the sixth century B.C., upon
which two enigmatic figures recline. You can also see a fairly well-
preserved chariot and impressive sculptures. Some of the most amazing
works are the tiniest: The Etruscans made intricate decorative objects
from woven gold. (Their goldsmithing techniques remain a mystery today.)
In the summer, the garden is the site of musical events (see Chapter 15).
Consider about three hours for a full visit.
Piazzale di Villa Giulia 9. % 06-3226571. www.ticketeria.it. Tram: 3 or 19 to 
last stop and then walk down Viale delle Belle Arti to Piazzale di Villa Giulia, or 
225 to Via di Villa Giulia. Admission: 4€ ($5.20). Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Palatino (Palatine Hill)
Colosseo
If you find the ruins in the Roman Forum confusing, you’ll find those on the
Palatino behind it sometimes incomprehensible. We definitely recommend
a guided tour. Huge blocks of brick surrounded by trees and greenery tes-
tify mutely to what was once an enormous residential complex of patrician
houses and imperial palaces, built with the grandiose ambitions of the
emperors. The throne room of the Domus Flavia was approximately 30m
(100 ft.) wide by 39m (131 ft.) long. Although Augustus began the develop-
ment of the Palatine residences, they were vastly expanded under Domitian,
a notoriously cruel emperor.
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 157

The Palatino is also where the first Roman developments started and
where Romulus drew the original square for the foundation of Rome.
Excavations in the area uncovered remains that date back to the eighth
century B.C. Casa di Livia (Livia’s House) is one of the best-preserved
homes. During the Middle Ages, the site was transformed into a fortress,
and during the Renaissance, it again became the residence of the aristoc-
racy, who built large villas (the Horti Palatini, erected by the Farnese on
top of the palaces of Tiberius and Caligula, for example). From the hill, you
can look down behind to the Circus Maximus.
Do not miss the Museo Palatino (Palatine Museum), housed in what was
the Palace of Caesar and later transformed into a convent. This is where
the most precious artwork recovered from the archaeological excavations
of the Palatino is conserved, including frescoes and sculptures. Admission
is included in your ticket. Depending on your pace and whether you visit
the museum, you should consider between one-and-a-half and two-and-a-
half hours for your visit.

Colosseo. % 06-39967700. Metro: Colosseo. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission: 8€ ($10);

Palazzo Altemps (Altemps Palace)
Navona/Pantheon
Situated behind Piazza Navona, the Palazzo Altemps was begun sometime
before 1477; continued by the cardinal of Volterra, Francesco Soderini, from
1511 to 1523; and finished by Marco Sittico Altemps, who enlarged it at the
end of the 1500s. The palace was restored in such a way that you can see the
layers of medieval, Renaissance, and later decoration. Inside is the Ludovisi
Collection, one of the world’s most famous private art collections, partic-
ularly strong in Greek and Roman sculpture as well as Egyptian works.
The most important piece from the Ludovisi Collection is the Trono
Ludovisi, a throne thought to be the work of a fifth-century-B.C. Greek sculp-
tor brought to Rome from Calabria. One side depicts Aphrodite Urania
rising from the waves; another shows a female figure offering incense; and
another side features a naked female playing a flute. The remarkable Dying
Gaul, depicting a man apparently committing suicide with a sword, was
commissioned by Julius Caesar and placed in his gardens to commemo-
rate his victories in Gaul. The Ares Ludovisi, a statue restored by Bernini
in 1622, is believed by art historians to be a Roman copy of an earlier Greek
work and shows a warrior (possibly Achilles) at rest. The colossal head of
Hera (also known as Juno) is one of the best-known Greek sculptures;
Goethe wrote of it as his “first love” in Rome and said it was like “a canto
of Homer.” It has been identified as an idealized portrait of Antonia Augusta,
mother of Emperor Claudius. Plan to spend at least one hour here.

Palazzo Massimo alle Terme (Massimo Palace by the Terme)
Repubblica
Founded in 1889, this museum was recently completely restored and reor-
ganized. It holds a fantastic collection of Ancient Roman art put together
from decades of excavations in Rome and Rome’s environs. Among the
most striking works are a satyr pouring wine, a Roman copy of the origi-
nal by Greek sculptor Praxiteles; Daughter of Niobe, from the Gardens of
Sallust; and an Apollo copied from an original by Phidias, one of the great-
est Ancient Greek sculptors. These few examples are only highlights — the
museum’s collection includes literally hundreds of statues, including an
interesting series showing how the style of representation changed under
various emperors, and even discussing the family resemblances of the
Claudians, Flavians, and other dynasties. The upper level holds a magnif-
icent collection of floor mosaics, including many large ones that once
graced some of the most elegant villas in Ancient Rome. But the part that
really took our breath away the first time is the separate section holding
the fresco collection: Entire rooms from the Villa of Livia on the Palatine
Hill have been reconstructed here, and you can enjoy the frescos as they
were meant to be. Note: You can visit the fresco collection by guided tour
only — you will be assigned a time when you enter the museum — and it
is best to make a reservation.
The basement of the museum contains a huge and fascinating numismatic
display, with coins dating from the origin of the monetary system in the
8th century B.C. through the 21st century and the introduction of the euro
(much of the collection once belonged to the king of Italy). The exhibit
explains, among other things, the economy of Ancient Rome and of
Renaissance Italy. Also in the basement are the Roman jewelry collection
of the royal house of Savoy and many items from burial sites, such as a
rare Roman mummy of a child buried with her most precious belongings.
The whole visit, including the tour of the fresco collection, will take you a
minimum of two hours.

Pantheon
Navona/Pantheon
Rome’s best-preserved monument of antiquity, the imposing Pantheon was
rebuilt by the Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 125 over the smaller original temple
built by Marcus Agrippa in 27 B.C. as a temple for all the gods (from the
ancient Greek pan theon, meaning “all gods”). It was eventually saved from
destruction by being transformed into a Christian church in A.D. 609. The
adjective that all descriptions of the Pantheon should contain is perfect:
The building is 43m (142 ft.) wide and 43m (142 ft.) tall. The portico is sup-
ported by huge granite columns, all but three of which are original, and
the bronze doors weigh 20 tons each. Inside, the empty niches surround-
ing the space once contained marble statues of Roman gods; most of the
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
160

marble floor is also original. Animals were once sacrificed beneath the
beautiful coffered dome, whose 5.4m (18-ft.) hole (oculus) lets in the light
(and sometimes rain) of the Eternal City. An architectural marvel, this
dome inspired Michelangelo when he was designing the dome of St. Peter’s,
though he made the basilica’s dome 0.6m (2 ft.) smaller. Inside, you’ll find
the tombs of the painter Raphael and of two of the kings of Italy. Crowds
always congregate in the square in front, Piazza della Rotonda (Piazza del
Pantheon to Romans), one of the nicest squares in Rome; it is graced by a
fountain by Giacomo della Porta. Cafes — as well as a McDonald’s, an addi-
tion much opposed by the locals — line the square; the fast-food eatery is
detectable from the plastic tablecloths and, unfortunately, the smell. A half-
hour should be enough to take in the highlights of the monument, plus
another hour to soak in the atmosphere from the terrace of one of the cafes.

Free. Open: Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m, holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m.
Piazza di Spagna and Scalinata di Spagna (Spanish Steps)
Piazza di Spagna
The Piazza di Spagna and the Scalinata di Spagna (Spanish Steps) rising from
the piazza are the meeting place of Rome. In spring, the steps are decorated
with colorful azaleas, but in any season, the square is atmospheric —
though you can hardly see it when it’s covered with wall-to-wall tourists,
lovers, backpackers, Roman youth, and so on. The atmosphere is festive
and convivial, though. The piazza’s name comes from the 16th century,
when the Spanish ambassador made his residence here. In those days, the
piazza was far less hospitable. (People passing through the piazza at night
sometimes disappeared, because it was technically Spanish territory, and
the unwary could be press-ganged into the Spanish army.) The area’s most
famous resident was English poet John Keats, who lived and died in the
house to the right of the steps, which is now the Keats–Shelley Memorial
House (% 06-6784235; open Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–6 p.m., Sat 11
a.m.–2 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.; admission: 3€/$3.90). And by the way, the real
name of the steps isn’t the Spanish Steps but the Scalinata della Trinità del
Monte, because they lead to the Trinità del Monte church, whose towers
loom above. At the foot of the steps, the boat-shaped fountain by Pietro
Bernini, father of Gian Lorenzo, is one of the most famous in Rome.
See map p. 148. Via del Babuino and Via dei Condotti. Metro: Line A to Spagna. Bus:
Minibus 117 or 119 to Piazza di Spagna.
Piazza Navona
Navona/Pantheon
One of Rome’s most beautiful piazze and also one of its most popular hang-
outs, Piazza Navona was built on the ruins of the Stadium of Domitian
from the first century A.D., where chariot races were held (note the oval
track form). Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the bottom of the square
was flooded for carnival-float parades. The twin-towered facade of Santa
Agnese in Agone is a baroque masterpiece by Borromini, who renovated
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 161

and rebuilt the original church, which had been constructed on the site
between the 8th and the 12th centuries. The interior was also redecorated
in the 17th century, but in the lower level, you’ll find vestiges of Domitian’s
stadium, with an Ancient Roman mosaic floor. The square’s other great
baroque masterpiece is Bernini’s Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of
the Four Rivers), with massive figures representing the Nile, Danube, della
Plata, and Ganges — the figure with the shrouded head is the Nile, because
its source was unknown at the time. Built in 1651, it is crowned by an
obelisk, a Roman copy from Domitian’s time. This fountain came as a mon-
umental addition to the two simple fountains already existing at each end
of the square. Created in 1576 by Giacomo della Porta, they were deco-
rated with figures only later. Bernini also designed the Fontana del Moro
(Fountain of the Moor) at the piazza’s south end, which was finished in 1654
(the tritons and other ornaments are 19th-century copies made to replace
the originals, which were moved to the garden of Villa Borghese lake),
whereas the figures of the Fontana di Neptuno (Fountain of Neptune), at
the piazza’s north end, were added in the 19th century to balance the
Fountain of the Moor.
On the east side of the square is the famous Palazzo Braschi, which opened
its doors in May 2002 after 15 years of closure and an $8 million restoration.
It houses the Museo di Roma, covering the cultural, social, and artistic life
of the city from the Middle Ages to the first half of the 20th century.
Interesting temporary exhibitions are often on display as well. The palazzo
is an attraction in itself, a baroque palace with a grand staircase (Via di
San Pantaleo 10; % 06-67108346; www.museodiroma.comune.roma.it;
open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; admission: 6.20€/$8).

Foro Romano (Roman Forum)
Colosseo
The Roman Forum, the original forum used as market and meeting place,
was gradually expanded by the various emperors and remained the heart
of public life in Ancient Rome for over a thousand years. The ruins lie in
the valley between the Capitoline Hill, site of the great Jupiter Temple, and
the Palatine Hill, where the royal palace, and later the palaces of other
noble families, were located. The forum was built at the end of the seventh
century B.C., after the existing marshes were drained by the Cloaca
Massima, the huge drainage and sewer canal under the forum. The forum
is crossed by the Via Sacra, the “sacred street,” so called because it led to
the main temples on the Capitoline Hill (today, Piazza del Campidoglio). A
stone discovered under the forum in 1899 bears an inscription from the
sixth century B.C., the time of the Roman kings. The forum has many ruins
(some, like the sanctuary of the sewer goddess Venus Cloaca, are just a
mark on the ground), as well as a few standing buildings. The most impor-
tant structure is the square Curia, where the Senate once met; many of the
walls were heavily restored in 1937, but the marble-inlay floor inside is
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
162

Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 163
original from the third century A.D. Also well conserved is the Temple of
Antoninus and Faustina (the Emperor Antoninus Pius, who succeeded
Hadrian in A.D. 138), because it was turned into a church and given a
baroque facade (as the Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Miranda).
Near the Curia is the Arch of Septimius Severus, built in A.D. 203 to com-
memorate this emperor’s victories. The arch originally mentioned his two
sons, Caracalla and Geta, but after Caracalla murdered Geta, Geta’s name
was removed. At the other end of the forum is the Arch of Titus. Titus
reigned as emperor from A.D. 79 to 81. Nearby is the hulking form of the
fourth-century Basilica of Constantine and Maxentius, which occupies
the site of what was Rome’s law courts. The Temple of the Dioscuri, ded-
icated to the twins Castor and Pollux, is immediately recognizable by its
three remaining columns joined by a piece of architrave. Against the
Capitoline Hill, you see the Temple of Saturn, which housed the first treas-
ury of Rome. It was also the site of the feast that was the pagan ancestor
of Christmas.
If you buy a map of the forum when you enter, you can identify the some-
times faint traces of a host of other structures (also see the map “The Roman
Forum and Imperial Forums,” p. 164).
Note: At press time, the Antiquarium Forense, which contains materials
from the excavations of the forum, was closed for restoration. No date was
set for the reopening, but check for updates at the ticket booth or with the
tourist office.
As with any archaeological site, things often make much more sense if you
take a guided tour. The tour in English is at 10:30 a.m. daily and lasts about
an hour. Ask at the ticket booth or, even better, make a reservation.

San Giovanni in Laterano (St. John in Laterano) 
and Cloister Colosseo
Built in A.D. 13 by Constantine, this cathedral of the diocese of Rome
(St. Peter’s Basilica is in the separate city-state of the Vatican) suffered
many indignities, including being sacked by the Vandals (a barbarian tribe
whose name has given us the word vandalism), burned, and then damaged
in an 896 earthquake. The basilica was restored and rebuilt at various times
by different architects. The facade, designed and executed by Alessandro
Galilei in 1735, is crowned by 15 giant statues (7m/22 ft. tall) representing
Christ, St. John the Baptist, John the Evangelist, and other doctors of the
Church; you can see them from many parts of Rome. Outside is an Egyptian
obelisk, the tallest in Rome (32m/105 ft.), consecrated in the fourth cen-
tury as a symbol of Christianity’s victory over pagan cults.

The interior of the basilica as you see it today was redesigned by Borromini
in the 17th century. The papal altar — under a beautiful 14th-century bal-
dacchino (canopy) — conserves an important relic: the wooden altar on
which Peter and the other paleo-Christian popes after him are said to have
celebrated mass in Ancient Rome’s catacombs. In the left transept is the
altar of the Santissimo Sacramento, decorated with four giant, gilded-
bronze columns that are the only remains of the original basilica. Under the
baldacchino of this altar is another important relic, said to be the table of
Christ’s Last Supper. The apse was redone during the 19th century, and its
mosaics are copies of the original medieval mosaics. However, the fresco
fragment depicting Pope Boniface VIII, who declared the first Papal Jubilee
in 1300, is from the 14th century. The Baptistry was built by Constantine
in the fourth century, making it the first of the Western world. (The walls are
original, although the interior was restored several times, and the present
form was designed by Borromini.) From a side door, you can access the
delightful 13th-century cloister, which was designed by Vassalletto and is
a showcase for carvings and other art pieces from the older basilica, includ-
ing paleo-Christian inscriptions. Set aside at least an hour for your visit.

Mercati Traianei and Foro di Traiano (Trajan’s 
Market and Trajan’s Forum)
Colosseo
During the first century A.D., each Roman emperor added luxurious public
constructions to the original Roman Forum (see listing earlier in this chap-
ter), and each new forum was named after the emperor who built it.
Emperor Trajan added the most splendid of them all, an elegant open
space — Trajan’s Forum — overlooked by a tall curved building —
Trajan’s Markets. Unfortunately, many of the temples and decorations
were dismantled during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, when the
marble was used for other construction, but the archaeological remains

are still fascinating. Walking north along the Via dei Fori Imperiali from the
Colosseum, you can see the archaeological site from the outside (to your
right), but obviously, a visit to the impressive brick complex itself affords
an irreplaceable experience. This second-century structure housed stalls
and small boutiques — sort of an ancient mall — as well as meeting places.
Note: Most of the Imperial Fori were covered in the 1920s to build Via dei
Fori Imperiali, a major transportation artery of modern Rome, and today,
the whole area is being excavated in the largest Roman archaeological
excavation to date. The plan is to exhibit the findings of these excavations
in the Trajan Markets. To accommodate the excavation, the visit has tem-
porarily been reduced to Trajan’s Forum and part of the semicircular build-
ing; the temporary entrance is from Trajan’s Column off Piazza Venezia,
and reduced admission is 3.20€ ($4.20). Count about 40 minutes for the
reduced visit.

Fontana di Trevi (Trevi Fountain)
Trevi
The massive Trevi Fountain, fronting its own little piazza, existed for cen-
turies in relative obscurity before it became one of the must-see sights of
Rome, thanks to the film Three Coins in the Fountain. Today, it seems that
many of the thousands who clog the space in front of it don’t take the time
to really look at it — instead, they throw coins in it, have their pictures
taken in front of it, and go on their way. If you want a tranquil moment to
actually appreciate the artwork, you must visit late at night or early in the
morning. The fountain was begun by Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, but
there was a 100-year lapse in the works, and it wasn’t completed until 1751
by Nicola Salvi. The central figure is Neptune, who guides a chariot pulled
by plunging sea horses. Tritons (mythological sea dwellers) guide the
horses, and the surrounding scene is one of wild nature and bare stone.
Of course, you have to toss a coin in the Trevi, something all kids love to
do. To do it properly (Romans are superstitious), hold the coin in your
right hand, turn your back to the fountain, and toss the coin over your left
shoulder. According to tradition, the spirit of the fountain will then see to
it that you return to Rome one day.
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
166
A pocketful of change
In many of Rome’s churches, fragile paintings are kept in semiobscurity, but you’ll often
find a light box nearby. When you insert a coin or two, a light pops on to illuminate a
painting, fresco, or sculpture for a limited amount of time. Carrying a pocketful of coins
is always a good idea.

See map p. 148. Piazza di Trevi. Bus: 62 or Minibus 116 or 119. Take Via Poli to the
fountain.
The Vatican
In 1929, the Lateran Treaty between Pope Pius XI and the Italian govern-
ment recognized the independent state of the Holy See, with its physical
seat in Vatican City (St. Peter’s Basilica and adjacent buildings). Politically
independent from Italy, the Vatican is the world’s second-smallest sover-
eign state, with its own administration, post office, and tourist office.
The Vatican comprises St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican Museums, and the
Vatican Gardens, all reviewed in this section.
Making the Vatican Information Office (% 06-69884466; open Mon–Sat
8:30 a.m.–7 p.m.) the first stop on your visit is a good idea — it’s just to
the left of the entrance to St. Peter’s. In the tourist office, you can get a
plan of the basilica — very useful, given the sheer size of the thing —
and make a reservation for a tour of the Vatican Gardens. You can also
find the Vatican Post Office — nice stamps and reliable service — and
public restrooms.
Consider that at the Vatican, even the men wear ankle-length gowns, and
the most popular color is black. Bare shoulders, halter tops, tank tops,
shorts, and skirts above the knee will definitely result in your being turned
away from the basilica. This is, after all, the center of a world religion,
not just a tourist extravaganza.
Piazza San Pietro (St. Peter’s Square)
San Pietro
The entrance to the Vatican is through one of the world’s greatest public
spaces — Bernini’s Piazza San Pietro (St. Peter’s Square). As you stand in
the huge piazza (no cars allowed), you’re in the arms of an ellipse partly
enclosed by a majestic Doric-pillared colonnade, atop which stand stat-
ues of some 140 saints. Straight ahead is the facade of Basilica di San
Pietro (St. Peter’s Basilica); the two statues flanking the entrance repre-
sent St. Peter and St. Paul, Peter carrying the Keys to the Kingdom. To the
right, above the colonnade, are the ochre buildings of the papal apart-
ments and the Musei Vaticani (Vatican Museum). In the center of the
square is an Egyptian obelisk, brought from the ancient city of Heliopolis
on the Nile delta. On either side are 17th-century fountains — the one on
the right by Carlo Maderno, who designed the facade of St. Peter’s, was
placed here by Bernini himself; the one on the left is by Carlo Fontana. The
piazza is particularly magical at night during the Christmas season, when
a presepio (nativity scene) and a large tree take center stage.
See map p. 148. Bus: 62 or 64 to Via della Conciliazione, and follow it to the end. Metro:
Ottaviano/San Pietro; take Via di Porta Angelica, and follow it to the end.
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 167

Basilica di San Pietro (St. Peter’s Basilica)
San Pietro
In 324, Emperor Constantine commissioned a sanctuary to be built on the
site of St. Peter’s tomb. The first apostle was thought to have been buried
here under a simple stone, and excavation and studies commissioned by the
Vatican have produced additional proof that the tomb is indeed St. Peter’s.
You can find the tomb in the present basilica’s central nave, under the mag-
nificent altar by Bernini.
The original basilica stood for about 1,000 years. After a millennium of
remodeling, pillaging, sacking, and rebuilding, it was on the verge of col-
lapse. The basilica you see today, mostly High Renaissance and baroque,
began with the renovation begun in 1503 following designs by the archi-
tects Sangallo and Bramante. Michelangelo was appointed to finish the
magnificent dome in 1547 but wasn’t able to do so; he died in 1564, and
his disciple Giacomo della Porta completed the job.
The inside of the basilica is almost too huge to take in; walking from one
end to the other is a workout, and the opulence will overpower you. On the
right as you enter is Michelangelo’s exquisite Pietà, created when the
master was in his early 20s. (Because of an act of vandalism in the 1970s,
the statue is kept behind reinforced glass.) Dominating the nave is Bernini’s
29m-tall (96-ft.) baldacchino (canopy), supported by richly decorated
twisting columns. Completed in 1633, it was criticized for being excessive
and because the bronze was supposedly taken from the Pantheon. The
canopy stands over the papal altar, which in turn stands over the tomb of
St. Peter. A bronze statue of St. Peter (probably by Arnolfo di Cambio,
13th century) marks the tomb; its right foot has been worn away by the mil-
lions of pilgrims kissing it in the traditional devotional gesture to salute the
pope. By the apse, above an altar, is the bronze throne sculpted by Bernini
to house the remains of what is, according to legend, the chair of St. Peter.
To visit Michelangelo’s dome and marvel at the astounding view, you have
to climb some 491 steps. Make sure that you’re ready and willing to climb,
however, because after you’ve started up, you’re not allowed to turn

How to attend a papal audience
Many Catholics come to Rome to attend a papal audience, during which the pope
addresses a crowd of people gathered in the Vatican (but of course, you don’t have to
be Catholic to attend). To attend a papal audience (Wed only; entrance between 10
and 10:30 a.m.), you must get free tickets from the Prefecture of the Papal Household
(% 06-69883114) at the bronze door under Piazza di San Pietro’s right colonnade
(Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m.). To get tickets in advance, write to the Prefecture of the Papal
Household, 00120 Città del Vaticano, indicating your language, the dates of your visit,
the number of people in your party, and (if possible) the hotel in Rome to which the
office should send your tickets the afternoon before the audience.

it’ll save you 171 steps. You have to make a reservation for the elevator
when you buy your ticket to enter the dome (you’ll pay an additional
1†/$1.30). On busy days, expect to wait in line to get a lift.
Beneath the basilica are grottoes, extending under the central nave 
of the church. You can visit them and wander among the tombs of popes.
The excavations proceed farther down, to the paleo-Christian tombs and
architectural fragments of the original basilica that have been found here,
but you need to apply in writing at least three weeks beforehand to arrange
for a visit.
Plan on at least three hours to see the entire basilica.
See map p. 148. Piazza San Pietro, % 06-69884466. Bus: 62 or 64 to Via della
Conciliazione. Metro: Ottaviano/San Pietro. Take Viale Angelico to the Vatican.
Admission: Basilica and grottoes free; dome 4€ ($5.20), with elevator 5€ ($6.50).
Open: Oct–Mar basilica daily 7 a.m.–6 p.m., dome daily 8 a.m.–4:45 p.m.; Apr–Sept
basilica daily 7 a.m.–7 p.m., dome daily 8 a.m.–5:45 p.m.; grottoes daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.

Musei Vaticani (The Vatican Museums)
San Pietro
This enormous complex of museums could swallow up your entire vaca-
tion, with its tons of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Roman, paleo-Christian, and
Renaissance art. Four museums house the art: the Gregorian Egyptian
Museum, a fantastic collection of Egyptian artifacts; the Gregorian
Etruscan Museum, a beautiful collection of Etruscan art and jewelry; the
Ethnological Missionary Museum, a large collection of artifacts from every
continent, including superb African, Asian, and Australian art; and the
Pinacoteca (picture gallery), the most famous of the Vatican Museums,
which contains works by medieval and Renaissance masters. In Room 9 of
the Pinacoteca is Leonardo da Vinci’s St. Jerome, which has been pieced
back together — one piece had ended up as a stool seat in a shoemaker’s
shop; the other, as a tabletop in an antiques shop. In Room 2 is Giotto’s
luminous Stefaneschi Triptych; in Room 8, Raphael’s Transfiguration.
Other highlights include works by Beato Angelico, Perugino, Bernini, and
Caravaggio (a single but great painting, the Deposition from the Cross).
Also part of the museums are the Stanze di Raffaello, which translates as
Raphael’s Rooms, although they are in fact the private apartments of Pope
Julius II, which were frescoed by the artist. The largest of the four rooms is
the room of Constantine, painted between 1517 and 1524, which illustrates
key moments in the life of the first Christian emperor, including his triumph
over Maxentius and his vision of the cross. Along the way, you’ll come
across the Appartamento Borgia (Borgia Apartments), designed for Pope
Alexander VI (the infamous Borgia pope), and the Cappella di Nicola V
(Chapel of Nicholas V), with floor-to-ceiling frescoes by Fra Angelico.
But of course, it is the Cappella Sistina (Sistine Chapel), Michelangelo’s
masterpiece, that is the crowning glory of the museums. Years after their
restoration, conflict continues over whether too much paint was removed,
flattening the figures. On the other hand, the brilliant color has been
restored. Whether you like the colors of the drapery or not, Michelangelo’s
modeling of the human form is incredible. The Creation of Adam and the
temptation and fall of Adam and Eve are the most famous scenes.
Michelangelo also painted a terrifying and powerful Last Judgment on the
end wall.
Binoculars or even a hand mirror will help you appreciate the Sistine ceil-
ing better; your neck tires long before you can take it all in. Just think how
poor Michelangelo must have felt while painting it flat on his back atop a
tower of scaffolding!
Visiting the whole museum complex in one day is impossible. If you don’t
want to take a guided tour, you can follow one of the four color-coded itin-
eraries (A, B, C, or D), taking you to the highlights of the museums. They
range from one-and-a-half to five hours, and all end at the Sistine Chapel.
We recommend that you pick and choose according to your personal taste:
Perhaps you’re fascinated by Ancient Egypt and are only marginally inter-
ested in paintings; maybe you prefer to view African and Asian art and the

frescoed apartments. Whatever you do, we recommend the audio guide
(rental: 5.50€/$7.15) to avoid the “Stendhal syndrome” of sensory over-
load (see “Seeing Rome by Guided Tour,” later in this chapter). The guide
discusses over 300 artworks; select what you want to hear by pressing a
work’s label number.
The museums charge no admission on the last Sunday of each month, but
the crowds are unbelievable, especially in the good season. We recommend
paying a visit during a less busy time; after all, you don’t know whether
you’ll have time to come back.

Giardini Vaticani (Vatican Gardens)
San Pietro
People often think that the Vatican is made up of only the basilica and the
museums, but behind those walls lies a busy town surrounding a huge —
and splendid — park. You can catch a glimpse of the park from the windows
of the Vatican Museums, revealing groomed grounds, fountains, and elegant
Renaissance buildings. Although normally, you need a special permit to
enter the Vatican grounds, you can sign up for the special guided tours that
take small numbers of visitors to the gardens. Tours last two hours and
start by bus. If you forgot to ask for a reservation (by phone or fax — see
the following paragraph), try to sign up directly at the Vatican Information
Office (see contact information at the beginning of this section) — it may
be able to fit you in an upcoming tour.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Rome has so many famous attractions that many lesser-known sights are
often overlooked, yet many of them are also first rate and well worth a
visit. Here are a few of our favorites, organized by type.
For museum buffs
If you love museums, Rome is the perfect city for you; the problem, if
anything, is that there are too many to take in on a single visit unless
you’re staying for weeks or months. The advantage is that you can find a
museum to satisfy the taste and special interests of everyone. Here are
a few suggestions in addition to such famous choices as the Capitoline
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
172

Museums, the National Roman Museums, and the Vatican Museums,
which we describe in the previous sections.
Centrale Montemartini (Montemartini Plant)
Testaccio
When the Capitoline Museums’ Palazzo Nuovo was restored, the Greek
and Roman sculpture collection was permanently moved to this new site,
the first electrical plant built in Rome, dating from 1912. An intriguing and
beautiful setting for the art collection, it contains over 400 sculptures;
among the most important pieces is a huge mosaic with hunting scenes
(6m x 12m/20 x 40 ft.) recovered from one of the Ancient Roman imperial
residences. Plan to spend about an hour here.
See map p. 148. Via Ostiense 106. % 06-5748038. www.centralemonemartini.
org. Metro: Line B to Pyramide; walk down Via Ostiense. Bus: 23 to Via Ostiense.
Tram: 3 to Piazza di Porta San Paolo (Stazione Ostiense, Piramide). Admission: 4.20€
($5.50). Open: Tues–Sun 9:30 a.m–7 p.m. Closed Jan 1, May 1, Oct 28–29, and Dec 25.
Museo Barracco (Barracco Museum)
Navona/Pantheon
This wonderful small museum was the private collection of Baron Giovanni
Barracco, which he donated to the city at his death. Housed in a 16th-century
palazzo, the collection was conceived as a panoramic history of ancient
sculpture and includes superb examples of Assyro-Babylonian, Egyptian,
Greek, and Roman sculpture. Note: The museum was being restored at
press time and should reopen in 2006. You’ll need about one-and-a-half
hours for an in-depth visit.
See map p. 148. Corso Vittorio Emanuele II 168. % 06-68806848. Bus: 62, 64. Open:
Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m. and Sun 9 a.m.–1 p.m. Admission 3€ ($3.90); 2€ ($2.60) extra
for special exhibits.
Museo della Civiltá Romana (Museum of Roman Civilization)
EUR
Located south of il centro, in a modern neighborhood well connected by
public transportation, this interesting museum focuses on the history of
Ancient Rome and the spread of its civilization throughout the world. The
big attraction, and a favorite with kids, is an impressive model of Imperial
Rome, a perfect reconstruction in 1:250 scale. You’ll see all the great build-
ings intact, which helps you make sense of all the broken columns and
holes in the ground. Other models display facets of daily life in antiquity —
a good complement to your visit of Ancient Rome. You could easily spend
two hours here.
Piazza Giovanni Agnelli 10. % 06-5926141. Metro: EUR Fermi. Admission: 6.20€ ($8).
Open: Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–6:15 p.m. and Sun 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 173

Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali 
(National Museum of Musical Instruments)
Colosseo
This wonderful museum is great to visit (even if you aren’t a musician) for
the incredible variety of instruments, some of them true works of art.
Created in 1974 to house the private collection of famous Italian tenor Evan
Gorga (he was the first Rodolfo in Puccini’s Boheme back in 1896), it counts
over 3,000 pieces stretching from antiquity to the 19th century. Among the
showstoppers are a superb piano built in 1722, a beautiful harpsichord
built in Leipzig in 1537, and a trumpet from 1461. If you’re a fan of musical
instruments, schedule at least an hour for your visit.
See map p. 148. Piazza Santa Croce in Gerusalemme 9a. % 06-7014796. www.
museostrumentimusicali.it. Bus: 117. Tram: 3, 13. Admission 2€ ($2.60); more
for special exhibits. Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
For serious antiquity lovers
Rome was the cradle of the Roman Empire, and mementoes from the
Ancient Roman civilization are everywhere, in various levels of repair.
Ruins are so numerous that you would need months to explore them all;
you can use the Archeobus (see “Seeing Rome by Guided Tour,” later
in this chapter) to move from one to the other or to get an overview.
Besides the “biggies” — Baths of Caracalla, Colosseum, Domus Aurea,
Roman Forum, Pantheon, Palatine, and Trajan Markets — which are
reviewed in the previous sections, a number of others are well worth
a visit if you’re interested in archaeology or the ancient world.
Parco Archeologico dell’Appia Antica 
(Appian Way Archaeological Park)
This beautiful archaeological park starts beyond the Baths of Caracalla,
near the Aventino, and stretches for several miles to the south. Here, you
can walk over an original section of what was the first and most important
Roman consular road, called the Regina Viarum (Queen of Roads). Started
in 312 B.C. as the highway to Capua, the road was progressively extended
to reach Benevento (233km/146 miles to the southeast), then Taranto
(an extra 281km/176 miles), and finally all the way to Brindisi (another 70km/
40 miles). It was on this road that St. Peter, in flight from Rome, had his
vision of Jesus (a church stands where Peter asked, “Domine quo vadis?”
or “Lord, where are you going?”) and turned back toward his martyrdom.
The street is still paved with the original large, flat basalt stones and lined
with the remains of villas, tombs, and monuments against the background
of the beautiful countryside. The whole area is now a park, which you can
visit via the hop-on/hop-off Archeobus (see “Seeing Rome by Guided
Tour,” later in this chapter) or by bicycle — you can rent one at the park
visitor center Cartiera Latina (via Appia Antica 42) or at the Bar Caffe
dell’Appia Antica (Via Appia Antica 175); bikes rent for 3€ ($3.90) per

hour for the first three hours and 10€ ($13) for the whole day. Among the
archaeological attractions are the Circo di Massenzio (Maxentius Circus),
Mausoleo di Romolo (Mausoleum of Romulus), and Residenze Imperiali
(Imperial Residences), where you can see the ruins of the arena built by
the Emperor Maxentius in honor of his son Romulus and his mausoleum
(Via Appia Antica 153; % 06-7801324; open: Tues–Sun winter 9 a.m.–
5 p.m., summer 9 a.m.–1 p.m.; admission: 2.60€/$3.40). Another famous
attraction is the Mausoleo di Cecilia Metella (Mausoleum of Cecilia
Metella) (Via Appia Antica 161; % 06-39967700; open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m. to
1 hour before sunset; admission: 2€/$2.60). Metella was a first-century-B.C.
gentlewoman whose mausoleum was integrated into the fortification of a
medieval castle — Castrum Caetani — in 1303. Also on the Via Appia are
two sets of catacombs: the Catacombs of San Callisto (see listing earlier in
this chapter) and the Villa dei Quintili (see listing in this section).
See map p. 176. Via Appia Antica. % 06-5130682. www.parcoappiaantica.org.
Bus: Archeobus, 118, 218. Admission: Free.
Circo Massimo (Circus Maximus)
Aventino
A quarter-million Romans once watched chariot races in this oblong arena,
a huge, evocative space overlooked by the dramatic heights of the Palatino
and its soaring pines. Although the structures once flanking the arena have
almost disappeared, having been plundered for their stone in the Middle
Ages and Renaissance, the Circus Maximus has not lost its majesty and is
still a preferred destination for Roman joggers and tourists looking to give
their kids a place to expend some energy.
See map p. 148. Tram: 3. Admission: Free.
Aula Ottagona (Octagonal Hall)
Repubblica
Part of the Diocletian Baths (see listing later in this section), this is a beau-
tiful example of Ancient Roman architecture, completely preserved,
including its roof. Adapted into a planetarium in 1928, it is now accessible
from a separate entrance from the rest of the complex. Inside is an impor-
tant sculpture collection originating from several of the bath complexes
in Rome, including some famous statues, such as the two bronzes, one of
a Roman general of the second century and another of a sitting fighter of
the first century (in the last phase of restoration at press time and about
to be re-exhibited to the public). A staircase leads to the original level of
the floor, under which have been discovered remains of buildings on which
the baths were constructed.

Terme di Diocleziano (Diocletian Baths)
Repubblica
This grandiose Roman bath complex was built between A.D. 298 and 305
and covered a surface area of almost 1.5 million square feet! Part of the
thermal baths are occupied by Santa Maria degli Angeli, the church that
opens on Piazza della Repubblica (% 06-4880812; free admission). Piazza
della Repubblica itself was part of the baths and covers the imprint of
what originally was the main esedra (semicircular exercise area) at the
back of the complex, which should give you an idea of how enormous the
baths were. The church occupies the central monumental halls and what
was the tepidarium (warming halls), which was placed between the original
frigidarium (cooling area) and calidarium (sauna). The original Renaissance
plan — yet another example of Roman “creative reuse” — included a
church and an attached monastery with two cloisters, and was realized in
the 16th century by Michelangelo, who conserved much of the original
structures. In the 18th century, the church was enlarged and redecorated
to its present state by Luigi Vanvitelli. The monastery, with its beautiful
main cloister, has been converted into a museum holding a very rich col-
lection of epigraphy: inscriptions that have been found in the various
archaeological sites in Rome, mostly carved in stone.
See map p. 148. Viale E. de Nicola 78. % 06-39967700. Metro: Line B to Repubblica.
Admission: 5€ ($6.50). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7:45 p.m.
Colonna di Marco Aurelio (Triumphal Column of Marcus Aurelius)
Navona/Pantheon
At the center of beautiful Piazza Colonna, this commemorative column is an
imposing sight, 25m (83 ft.) tall and completely decorated with bas-reliefs.
The column was erected in honor of Marcus Aurelius, the enlightened
emperor who ruled from A.D. 161 to 180, and the reliefs recount his exploits
in battles against the German tribes. A statue of the emperor once adorned

the top, but in the 16th century, Pope Sixtus V replaced it with the statue
of St. Paul that you see today. The Palazzo Chigi on one side of the piazza
is the residence of the Italian prime minister, so don’t be surprised if you
see intense guys standing around with submachine guns.

Minibus 116, 117, or 119 to Piazza Colonna.
Villa dei Quintili (Quintili’s Villa)
Park of the Appia Antica
Recently opened after lengthy excavations (still ongoing), this was the
largest private villa in the Roman suburbs. It was the property of the two
brothers Quintili, who were consuls in A.D. 151. The structure was enlarged
when it became the property of the Emperor Commodus, who loved the
quiet and the villa’s thermal baths. For centuries, it was a mine of statuary
for treasure hunters; much of it is now on display in many of the great
museums of the world. For its sheer size — it extends between the Appia
Antica and the Appia Nuova — the site is quite impressive and affords
beautiful views of the Roman countryside.
Via Appia Nuova 1092. % 06-39967700. Admission: 6€ ($8). Includes admission to
the Baths of Caracalla and the Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.
to 1 hour before sunset.
For families with kids
Kids of all ages love imagining lost civilizations and treasure hunts, and
as Rome is essentially one big archaeological site, children will find much
to love about the city. Throughout this chapter, we use the Kid Friendly
icon to indicate what we believe are the best attractions for children.
Here, we give you a few more suggestions of places and activities that
are particularly suited for children or teens.

Boats down the Tiber
Trastevere
Sailing down the Tiber is a wonderful way to experience Rome. The
Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte San Angelo operates boat service
between Ponte Duca d’Aosta and Isola Tiberina. Boats have 50 seats and
leave every hour from 8 a.m to 2 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m.; check for the latest
schedule, because it changes often. You can also catch a boat at one of the
intermediary stops at the following bridges: Risorgimento, Cavour,
Sant’Angelo, Sisto, Isola Tiberina, and Ripa Grande. The ride is not only
idyllic, but also a convenient and inexpensive means of transportation,
provided that where you need to go is along the Tiber. The same company
also organizes special tours (see “Seeing Rome by Guided Tour,” later in
this chapter), including a wonderful cruise to Ostia Antica, which allows
you to get to Rome’s ancient seaport in much the same way as the Ancient
Romans (see Chapter 14).
See map p. 148. Ponte d’Aosta, off Piazza della Rovere. % 06-6789361 for info and
reservations. E-mail: info@battellidiroma.it. Fare: Single trip 1€ ($1.30);
daily pass 2.30€ ($3).
Cimitero dei Cappuccini (Capuchins Cemetery)
Via Veneto
In the crypt of the Chiesa dell’Immacolata Concezione is a fascinating, if
ghoulish, sight. A Capuchin monk used the bones of 4,000 of his brothers
to create a monument that reminds us — literally — that “in the midst of
life, we are in the midst of death.” Skeletal pieces decorate the ceilings and
walls of five underground chapels, creating interesting patterns and
designs (for example, rows of spinal vertebrae trace the vaults). Note: This
might be a “kid-friendly” sight if you have a teenager, but it would disturb
and frighten smaller children.
See map p. 148. Via Veneto 27, not far from the U.S. embassy; % 06-4871185. Metro:
Barberini. Bus: 62 or Minibus 116 or 119 to Largo Tritone. Admission: Donation. Open:
Fri–Wed 9 a.m. to noon and 3–6 p.m.
Villa Borghese
Parioli/Piazza del Popolo
Just above Piazza del Popolo and extending north beyond the city walls is
one of Rome’s most beautiful parks, formerly belonging to the aristocratic
Borghese family, who donated it to the city. Famous for the Galleria
Borghese (see listing earlier in this chapter), it is also beloved by Romans,
who come here to enjoy the greenery on weekends and the splendid
panorama over Rome from the Pincio. Maybe the most romantic spot of
Rome, this terrace above Piazza del Popolo offers a beautiful view that is
particularly striking at sunset. Inside the park is also the Piazza di Siena,
a picturesque oval track surrounded by tall pines, used for horse races
and particularly for the Concorso Ippico Internazionale di Roma (Rome’s
international horse-jumping event), held in May (see Chapter 3). This park
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
178

is perfect for a family picnic, especially in summer, when its beautiful
Roman pines offer relief from the heat.
See map p. 148. Piazza Porta Pinciana. Bus: Minibus 116, or 116T. Open: Park daily
from sunrise to sunset; Pincio terrace always open. Admission: Free.
For religious-architecture lovers: More great churches
Basilica di Santa Prassede (St. Prassede Basilica)
Repubblica
One of the oldest churches in Rome, Santa Prassede already existed in the
fifth century A.D. but was restored in the Middle Ages; the current entrance
dates back to that time. Inside are some splendid Byzantine mosaics, on
the arch over the main altar, in the apse, and in the splendid chapel of San
Zenone — Rome’s most important Byzantine monument. The church is
full of other works of art, including a bust of Bishop G. B. Santoni from
1614, an early work by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (located by the third column
to the right of the main nave).
See map p. 148. Via Santa Prassede 9, off Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore. % 06-
4882456. Metro: Termini. Walk south on Via Cavour. Bus: 70. Admission: 2€ ($2.60).
Open: Daily 7:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
San Pietro in Vincoli (St. Peter in Chains)
Colosseo
Vincoli means chains, and this church is named after the chains, on display
in a bronze urn in the crypt, that held St. Peter in Jerusalem and in Rome.
According to Catholic Church legend, the chains were miraculously
welded together when they were brought into contact in this church. This
ancient basilica, which was built in A.D. 439 over an older church and was
partially redecorated in the 18th century and then again in the 19th cen-
tury, also contains one of Michelangelo’s masterpieces, his famous Moses,
part of the majestic funeral monument he designed for Pope Julius II.
See map p. 148. Piazza San Pietro in Vincoli 4. % 06-4882865. Metro: Colosseo or
Cavour. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 8 a.m. to noon and 3:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Santa Maria Maggiore
Repubblica
This church’s history stretches back 1,600 years, and though it has under-
gone many changes over the centuries, Santa Maria Maggiore remains one
of the city’s four great basilicas. Ordered constructed by Pope Sisto III, it
was built as a sanctuary for Mary (mother of Jesus) and was originally
referred to as Santa Maria della Neve (St. Mary of the Snow) because its
outline was drawn in the snow that had miraculously fallen in the summer
of A.D. 352. The current baroque facade was designed by Ferdinando Fuga,
who sandwiched it between two palaces that had been built in the mean-
time (one in the 17th and the other in the 18th century). The walls, though,
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 179

are original, as are the mosaics of the apse and side walls. Although
restored, the floors are the original 12th-century Cosmatesque-style
(mosaic in marble and colored stones), and the 15th-century coffered
wooden ceiling is richly decorated with gold (said to be the first gold
brought back from the New World and donated by the Spanish queen).
One of the church’s main attractions is in the loggia: the 13th-century
mosaics preserved from the old facade. Look carefully to the right side of
the altar for the tomb of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Italy’s most important
baroque sculptor/architect. In the crypt are relics of what are said to be
pieces of Jesus’s crib. Inside the church is a little-known architectural mas-
terpiece by Michelangelo (he designed but did not complete it), the
Cappella Sforza; the small space is elegantly decorated and artificially
enlarged by the clever disposition of its angular columns.

Santa Maria d’Aracoeli
Teatro Marcello
Next to Piazza del Campidoglio (just by the Capitoline Museums), Santa
Maria d’Aracoeli dates from 1250 and is reached by a soaring flight of steps
(you can’t miss them as you approach the Campidoglio). It stands on the
site of an Ancient Roman temple. The exterior of the church is austere but
is punctuated by two rose windows, and inside are a number of interest-
ing works of art. The floor is an excellent example of Cosmati marblework
(the Cosmati were Roman stoneworkers of the Middle Ages). The Cappella
Bufalini (Bufalini Chapel) is decorated with Pinturicchio masterpieces,
frescoes depicting scenes from the life of St. Bernardino of Siena and
St. Francis receiving the stigmata.

Santa Maria sopra Minerva
Pantheon
The construction of this church started in the eighth century A.D. on the
foundation of an ancient temple to Minerva (goddess of wisdom), but the
present structure dates from 1280. This is the only Gothic church in Rome
(though you wouldn’t know it from the facade, due to a 17th-century revi-
sion, one of many), with its elegant pointed arches and blue starred ceiling.
The treasures inside include Michelangelo’s Cristo Portacroce in the
sanctuary, as well as frescoes by Filippino Lippi. Under the altar are the
relics of St. Catherine of Siena. The church also houses the tomb of the
painter Fra Angelico. On the square in front of the church is the much-
photographed Bernini elephant sculpture that serves as the base for a
sixth-century-B.C. Egyptian obelisk.

Santa Maria in Trastevere
Trastevere
Opening on a square graced by an early baroque fountain, this is believed
to be the first Roman church to be officially opened to the public. Founded
by Pope Saint Callixtus in the 3rd century A.D., it was later enlarged and
given its present look in the 12th century with materials from the Baths of
Caracalla (see listing earlier in this chapter). The facade is decorated with
its original mosaic, but the portico is a later, baroque addition. Inside, you
can admire the Cosmatesque floor; the richly decorated wooden ceiling
(designed by Domenichino in the 17th century); and the star of the show:
the beautifully preserved original mosaics decorating the apse. Over the
main altar is another famous artwork: the Madonna della Clemenza, a
unique painting from the sixth century.

Santa Maria in Cosmedin and Bocca della Verità 
(St. Mary in Cosmedin and Mouth of Truth)
Aventino
Although this Orthodox church is very pretty inside and outside — it’s one
of the few Roman churches to have escaped baroque “restoration” — the
real attraction is the famous Bocca della Verità (Mouth of Truth), a Roman
marble relief of a head with an open mouth that sits against the wall under
the porch outside the church. The round marble piece was in fact a Roman
manhole cover, but legend has it that if you put your hand inside the
mouth while lying, it will bite off your hand. (Remember the scene with
Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn from Roman Holiday?) Kids get a kick
out of putting their hands in the mouth. The church opens on Piazza
Bocca della Verità, one of the nicest squares in town — at its best during
off hours — with two small Roman temples still standing, the round one
believed to be dedicated to the goddess Vesta and the other to the twins
of Greek mythology, Castor and Pollux.

Open: Daily 7 a.m.–6:30 p.m.
Basilica di San Paolo Fuori Le Mura (St. Paul’s Basilica)
San Paolo (outside il centro)
This basilica, second in size and importance only to St. Peter’s, was built
well outside the city walls in what was then the countryside, along the road
that leads from Rome to the Ancient Roman seaport of Ostia (Via Ostiense).
San Paolo is now a modern neighborhood of Rome, well connected to the
city center by public transportation. According to tradition, the body of
St. Paul was buried here after his martyrdom. As early as the time of
Emperor Constantine in the fourth century A.D., a church was built around
St. Paul’s tomb (still below the high altar). Consecrated in A.D. 324 but later
vastly enlarged, this magnificent church was almost destroyed by fire in
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 181

1823 and rebuilt with marble salvaged from the original structure. The
apse and triumphal arch are original, and the mosaic in the apse is a faith-
ful copy of the 13th-century one, reconstructed with parts of the original
damaged by the fire. The baldacchino (canopy) — a masterpiece by
Arnolfo di Cambio from 1285 — miraculously escaped the fire. Under the
altar is the sepulchre of St. Paul, the tomb containing the saint’s remains;
it’s accessible via a staircase. The interior is vast and impressive (divided
by 80 granite columns), regardless of its age; the windows may look like
stained glass, but they’re actually made of translucent alabaster. The clois-
ters are original, and you’d have to go to Sicily to find such distinctively
carved and decorated columns of so many diverse patterns.

Roman piazze and palaces
Piazza del Quirinale and Palazzo del Quirinale
Trevi
Now the home of Italy’s president, the Palazzo del Quirinale was the resi-
dence of the king up until the end of World War II, and earlier in history, the
pope lived here — or hid, in the case of Pius VII, who locked himself in
after excommunicating Napoleon (it didn’t help: soldiers broke in and
carted him off to Fontainebleau for the duration of the Napoleonic era).
The royal family of Savoy substituted some gaudy and second-rate 19th-
century art for earlier decoration, but the palace is still impressive and
has some spectacular rooms. The private gardens enclosed by the palace
are gorgeous, especially in spring. Note: Bring your passport — you’ll need
to pass through an identity and security check in order to gain admission.
On the square, the fountain (Fontana di Monte Cavallo) has two giant stat-
ues of Castor and Pollux, the founders of Rome. The Egyptian obelisk
adorning the square was taken from the Mausoleum of Augustus by Pius
VI in 1793. Across from the palace’s entrance on the same side of the
square are the smaller buildings that were the Scuderie del Quirinale
(Palace Stables), today the setting of many fine-art exhibits (check with
the tourist office for the current schedule).

Piazza del Popolo
Piazza del Popolo
The “piazza of the people” really lives up to its name: Romans like to meet
here to talk, have a drink, hang out, and people-watch. You can do the
same, though be warned that the two cafes fronting the piazza gouge you
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
182

unmercifully if you sit at an outdoor table (or even an indoor one) instead
of taking your coffee at the counter like a Roman. Santa Maria del Popolo
(% 06-3610836) stands by the gate leading out to busy Piazzale Flaminio
(where you can catch lots of buses). Founded in 1099, the church contains
magnificent Caravaggios as well as a Pinturicchio. The brace of baroque
churches directly across the square are the work of Carlo Rainaldi, Bernini,
and Carlo Fontana. In the center is an Egyptian obelisk, one of Rome’s
most ancient objects, dating from 1200 B.C. It came from Heliopolis and had
been placed there by Ramses II, but was brought to Rome during
Augustus’s reign (it stood in the Circo Massimo until one of the popes, in
their nearly endless reshuffling and meddling with monuments, moved it
here). When you leave the piazza, head up the steps into the trees on the
east side. This path leads to the Pincio, the park overlooking the square,
which is one of the best places to see the sun set over Rome.

This delightful piazza is dominated by the Palazzo Farnese, surely one of
Rome’s most dramatic buildings, designed by Sangallo and Michelangelo.
The cleaning completed in 1999 turned its somber gray a startling pale
yellow and brought out the delicate decorations. Currently the seat of the
French embassy, it can be visited on selected Sundays; call the French

Villa Torlonia
Porta Pia
The Torlonia were — and still are — a noble Roman family (no less than
princes), and this was their family residence until the early 20th century,
when they donated the entire villa and the surrounding park to the city. In the
park are the main residence and the beautiful conservatory (both in ruins,
but plans are in process to restore the conservatory), as well as two
smaller buildings that have been fully restored and can be visited. One is
the Casina delle Civette (Cottage of the Owls), an Art Nouveau jewel with
whimsical architecture and beautiful stained-glass windows. Back in the
19th century, the prince allowed his artistic son to build this cottage as a
bachelor apartment; it now houses a museum of Art Nouveau glasswork.
On the other side of the park is the Casino dei Principi (Cottage of the
Princes), an elegant outbuilding that was the residence of Mussolini when
he was in power and that now preserves some of the collected artworks
of the Torlonia family. The beautiful grounds of the villa are a popular place
for Romans to exercise, meet, and relax. You can make a reservation for a
guided tour of the Casina delle Civette, which we recommend.

Galleria Spada
Campo de’ Fiori
This gorgeous 16th-century palazzo houses the State Council, but it has
recently been opened to the public, and you can now admire part of the
riches inside. From the elegant inner courtyard, you can access the beau-
tiful library and admire the famous and unique Galleria della Perspettiva
designed by Borromini (Borromini’s Perspective) — a magnificent corri-
dor in trompe-l’oeil style, which appears to be very long but is actually
made of diminutive columns that fool the eye (the sculpture at the end is
only waist high). Inside the palace, you can also visit the rich picture
gallery, a collection of works focusing mostly on 17th-century artists,
including Guido Reni, Guercino, and Tiziano. It is hung in Renaissance
style, just as it was when Cardinal Bernadino Spada acquired many of the
works. The paintings hang against walls that are still richly decorated,
gilded, and painted. We find particularly interesting some works by women:
Lavinia Fontana (1552–1614) and Artemesia Gentileschi (1593–1652). The
collection also includes two beautiful large globes from this period by
Willem Blaeu, one containing a small portrait of his friend, astronomer
Tyco Brahe.

Reopened after a long closure and completely restored, this is the palace
housing the private gallery of the noble Roman family Colonna. The visit
includes the actual apartments. The splendid 15th-century wing — the
Appartamento Principessa Isabelle — is richly decorated with frescoes by
Pinturicchio (Sala della Fontana) and a picture collection of Flemish masters,
including such artists as Jan Brueghel the Elder. The 17th-century wing —
the Appartamento Galleria Colonna — is a baroque extravaganza of works
of art and precious furnishings, including a picture collection with master-
pieces by Ghirlandaio, Veronese, Tintoretto, and Guercino, among others.

Villa Farnesina
Trastevere
Not exactly a picture gallery, this gorgeous villa holds a wonderful collec-
tion of frescoes by Raphael and other artists in a suite of rooms. Built
along the river Tiber in the early 16th century by the architect Baldassarre
Peruzzi — who also decorated with frescoes part of the interior — and
surrounded by a pleasant garden, it is a splendid example of Roman archi-
tecture. It was unfortunately mutilated in 1884 when the Lungotevere (the
riverside road) was built, destroying part of the gardens and a loggia over-
looking the river that was probably designed by Raphael. The villa was
built for the Chigi family; later passed to the Farnese; and is today the seat
of the Accademia dei Lincei, a major Italian cultural institute, and of the
National Print Gallery, the largest print collection in Italy. The frescoes in
the first room — the Loggia di Psiche — were done by Raphael’s assistants
from cartoons by Raphael, whereas the great fresco of Galatea in the Sala
di Galatea is by Raphael himself. The Camera da Letto on the second floor
was frescoed by Siennese artist Il Sodoma.

For history buffs
Campo de’ Fiori
Campo de’ Fiori
Surrounded by cafes, restaurants, and bars, the lovely square of Campo
de’ Fiori boasts many attractions. Its fruit-and-vegetable market is one of
the city’s best and certainly one of the liveliest. Though popular with work-
ing people as a lunch spot, the campo is even more popular with young
people (both Romans and foreigners) at night. The central statue of the
hooded Giordano Bruno hints at the more sinister parts of the campo’s
history — it was the site of executions in the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance, and Bruno was burned at the stake here in 1600. Bruno was
a philosopher who championed the ideas of early scientists like
Copernicus and maintained such heretical ideas as that the Earth revolved
around the sun.

Overlooking Trastevere, this is one of the two best places to see the
panorama of Rome, the other being the Pincio (see the listing for Villa
Borghese, earlier in this chapter). On the hill is a monument to Giuseppe
Garibaldi, perhaps the most beloved figure of the 19th-century Italian
struggle for self-determination, and a little farther down is a unique eques-

Italy, who unified the country. The construction took place between 1885
and 1911, and employed the most talented Italian artists of the time. Since
1921, it has also housed the Tomba del Milite Ignoto (Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier). Closed to the public for decades, it was recently com-
pletely restored, and it is now possible to admire the beautiful decorations.
Also, you can climb the stairs and enjoy one of the most beautiful views
over Rome, particularly at sunset. The lower floors house excellent art

Seeing Rome by Guided Tour
The French writer Stendhal once wrote, “As soon as you enter Rome, get
in a carriage and ask to be brought to the Coliseum [sic] or to St. Peter’s.
If you try to get there on foot, you will never arrive: Too many marvelous
things will stop you along the way.”
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
186

Taking a bus tour of this complicated city when you first arrive still is an
excellent idea. Doing so helps you get the general feeling of the place and
gives you an idea of what you’d like to see in depth. After you decide
what you want to see, you can take a walking tour of the area or areas
that interest you most and then do the rest by yourself.
Bus tours
We like the hop-on/hop-off formula: You can stay on to have the complete
tour and get an idea of what’s where and what it looks like, and then start
again and get down off the various stops. Here are some recommended
options:
 Rome’s public transportation authority, ATAC, gives the best bus
tour of Rome (% 06-46952252 daily 9 a.m.–8:30 p.m. for reservations
and info; www.trambus.com/servizituristici.htm); you can’t
beat the price or the options. The tourist line 110 “open” decker
buses leave from Piazza dei Cinquecento in front of Stazione Termini
every 15 minutes; you can stay on the bus for the whole itinerary
(the tour lasts about 2 hours and covers over 80 sites) or hop on
and off along the way at one of 10 stops. Tickets cost 13€ ($17) per
person; children under 6 ride free. The buses are new, and the tour
guides are professionals. It’s a great way to see many of the major
sights of Rome. You can buy tickets at the ATAC bus information
booth in front of Stazione Termini or on the bus (in which case you
need the exact fare in cash).
 Also run by ATAC, the Archeobus tour (% 06-46952252 daily
8:30 a.m.–8 p.m. for reservations and info; www.trambus.com/
servizituristici.htm) is another hop-on/hop-off itinerary (if you
decide to stay onboard, the whole tour takes just under 2 hours)
taking in 15 historic sites of Ancient Rome. The small, 16-seat elec-
tric buses leave every hour from Piazza dei Cinquecento (in front of
Termini train station) between 9:45 a.m. and 4:45 p.m.; tickets cost
8€ ($10) and can be purchased on board (with exact change).
 Stop ’n’ Go (Via Ezio 12; % 06-48905729; www.romecitytours.com)
offers eight departures daily for 12€ ($16) per person. The tour
starts in Piazza dei Cinquecento (in front of Stazione Termini) at
the corner of Via Massimo d’Azeglio and makes 14 stops; you can
get on or off at your leisure. (You can buy the ticket directly on the
bus; try to have exact change, but it’s not required.) If you prefer to
spend more time at the sights, Stop ’n’ Go offers two- and three-day
tickets for 18€ ($23) and 24€ ($31), respectively.
If you prefer a more traditional bus tour instead, several formulas are
available. Tours usually depart around 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 8 p.m. — with
possible pickup from your hotel included — and cost about 28€ ($36)
for a three-hour tour. Here are the three best operators: Appian Line
(Piazza dell’Esquilino 6; % 06-487861; www.appianline.it), Green
Line (Via Farini 5/A; % 06-483787; www.greenlinetours.com), and

Shopping the Local Stores
In this Chapter
 Browsing the best shopping areas
 Hunting for Roman specialties
 Searching out open-air markets
A
lot of people say Rome isn’t good for shopping, at least not com-
pared with Florence and Milan (the latter is the fashion capital
of Italy). That may be true, but there are certainly a vast array of goods
for sale in the capital city and a selection of some items — antique prints,
for instance — that other Italian cities cannot match. You’ll also find bar-
gains here when you know where to look — and you’ll have a great time
browsing in the process!
Surveying the Scene
Shopping in Rome is great, if only because of the splendid setting of the
major shopping areas — right in the heart of the city, among Roman ruins,
medieval streets, and Renaissance palaces. Italy’s largest city and also the
seat of government, Rome is full of elegant and fashionable shops both
for apparel and housewares, and the city is almost as good as Milan for
all the big names of Italian fashion, which you’ll find at great discounts
during the official sales period in January and again in July.
Rome was also once the center of a large artisan community, but here as
elsewhere, many historical trades have been lost, and in terms of crafts,
the city isn’t as rich as it was in ages past. Alas, very few workshops still
practice traditional arts. On the other hand, because this is the capital of
the country, you can find shops selling all the specialty items from around
the country. Thus, you can also shop for famous products from places that
you may not have time to visit, including Florence, Venice, and Sicily.
Needless to say, Rome has been and still is a center for the arts. If you had
a euro for every picture that’s been drawn of the Forum, you would be rich
enough to buy your own Roman villa. Rome has been a magnet for artists
for centuries, and views of the city’s Ancient and baroque monuments
have been endlessly reproduced, especially in prints. Rome is the best
place in Italy to find this specialized kind of artwork, as well as modern,
high-quality prints from antique plates.

Shopping hours are generally 9 or 9:30 a.m. (later for boutiques, which
may open as late as 10:30 or 11 a.m.) to about 1 or 1:30 p.m. and then
from 3:30 or 4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Many shops close Monday mornings, and
most are closed all day Sunday. In il centro, however, quite a few shops
now stay open during the lunchtime break and on Sundays.
Italy’s value-added tax (known as the IVA) is a steep 19 percent, but you
can get a refund for purchases costing more than 155€ ($178). This means
that if you spend that much or more with one merchant, regardless of
the number of items (three pairs of shoes, or five shirts, or whatever),
you can get the rebate. If you buy the three pairs of shoes at three differ-
ent stores, however, even if they add up to 155€, that doesn’t help you,
because they’re three different purchases.
The value-added tax is included in all the prices that you’re quoted.
Stores displaying a “TAX FREE” insignia can give you an invoice that you
can cash at the airport’s Customs office as you leave Italy. Otherwise,
you have to take the invoice from the store; have it stamped at the air-
port by Customs; and then mail it back to the store, which will then
send you a check or credit your charge account.
When shopping for clothes or shoes, keep in mind that Italian sizes are
different from those in the United States. Use Table 12-1 to find your
Italian size.

Checking Out the Department Stores
Italians are not as big on department stores as Americans are, and in
Rome, you’ll find only three major ones, but they are ubiquitous, with
a number of locations scattered around the city:
 La Rinascente is an elegant department store carrying mainly
clothes and accessories, with a larger selection for women and a
smaller one for children and men. It also carries a nice cosmetics
section on the ground floor and a smallish housewares selection.
It has two major locations in Rome: Piazza Fiume 1 (% 06-8416081)
and Piazza Colonna (% 06-6784209), both open daily from 9 a.m.
to 7:30 p.m.
 COIN is another upscale department store, with a trendier and
younger image, carrying a good selection of clothes and accessories
for women, men, and children, and some interesting housewares.
Its major locations are Via dei Gracchi (% 06-36004298), Piazzale
Appio 7 near San Giovanni Basilica (% 06-77250177), and Viale
Trastevere 60 (% 06-5816036). It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
 UPIM is a cheaper department store with a good selection of house-
wares and a rather inexpensive (and sometimes tacky) line of clothes
for women, men, and children, as well as a modest selection of toys,
stationery, and odds and ends. You’ll find it in Via del Tritone 172
(% 06-6783336), Piazza di Santa Maria Maggiore (% 06-4465579),
and Via Giovanni Giolitti 10 (% 06-47825909) by Termini station.
All are open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Going to Market
The most colorful of the food markets — and the most famous in Rome —
is in the lively and picturesque Campo de’ Fiori (Bus: 62 or 64 to Largo
Argentina), where you’ll find fresh fruit and vegetables, fish, meat, cheese,
and cured meats, each sold by specialized vendors. It is surprising that the
market hasn’t become touristy, given the site; the vendors still keep selling
all kinds of great goodies that Romans eat, from artichokes to anchovies,
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 191

at good prices. It starts early in the morning — some vendors arrive as
early as 6 — and ends around 2 p.m. Another historical food market, and
also a great one, is in Piazza San Cosimato in the heart of Trastevere
(Tram: 8), with a great variety of vendors and excellent quality and prices;
it observes the same hours as Campo de’ Fiori. The noisiest and most exu-
berant food market of them all is in Piazza Vittorio, not far from Termini
Station, in an area of Rome that has been taken over by Asian and African
immigrants, leading to an exotic choice of merchandise. In addition to
food, you’ll find stands selling cheap clothes and accessories.
There are a lot of other things to buy at market besides food. The anti-
quarian book and print market on Piazza Fontanella Borghese in the
Navona/Pantheon neighborhood (Bus: 81 or Minibus 117 or 119 to the
Corso at Via Tomacelli) is a historic small market and a great place to
browse if you know your stuff — otherwise, caveat emptor (let the buyer
beware), to use a Roman (or at least Latin) phrase.
For a truly uproarious market where you’ll see average Romans search-
ing for every conceivable item, visit the most famous of flea markets in
Rome, at Porta Portese. Extending over several streets in Trastevere,
this market is organized by type of merchandise: antiques, automotive,
clothes, house fabrics, and so on. You never know what you’re going to
find, from oil paintings to tube socks. It’s a fun place to go, and you’re
likely to find something you like, but go early to have a good selection
before the mobs have picked over the merchandise. It’s open only on
Saturday and Sunday from about 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Another famous but smaller operation is the market in Via Sannio
(off Piazza San Giovanni, near Colosseo and Aventino), with interesting
clothes, accessories, and camping equipment. It’s open daily from 7 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Pickpockets are absolutely dreadful on weekends, when it gets
most crowded. In both these markets, a small amount of dickering over
the price is usual, so you can practice your bargaining skills.
In these bustling markets, particularly the flea markets, be very aware of
pickpockets, who take advantage of the crowds.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
If you don’t want to spend any money as you window-shop in the following
shopping neighborhoods, you should leave your purse at home, because
you’ll see plenty of goodies tempting you to open your wallet wide.
Il Corso
The best shopping area in Rome is right in il centro — the triangle of
medieval and Renaissance streets running between Piazza del Popolo,
Piazza Venezia, and Piazza di Spagna. This area actually includes Via
del Corso itself — now restricted to pedestrians (except for buses and
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
192

taxis) — which is the area’s main artery. The exclusive shopping area
around Piazza di Spagna with Via Frattina and Via dei Condotti also
falls within this part of il centro. Here is where the big names of Roman
shopping concentrate; along these streets are the best designer bou-
tiques and all the stars of Italian fashion (Bulgari, Ferragamo, Valentino,
Armani, and so on), with prices so high you may get a nosebleed. But
you’ll also find small shops specializing in items ranging from stylish
Italian housewares to antiques. With more variety and lower prices, the
Corso is lined with shops selling everything from clothing to shoes to
CDs. Some are fashionable; some are touristy; others are just trendy
(and a few are rather tacky). On the Corso, you’re more likely to see
average Romans buying things that real people wear and at prices
they can afford. You can find Fendi (Via Borgognona 39; % 06-696661),
Valentino (Via dei Condotti 13; % 06-6739420), Gucci (Via Condotti 8;
% 06-6793888), Armani (Via dei Condotti 77; % 06-6991460), and Emporio
Armani (Via del Babuino 140; % 06-36002197) nearby. Battistoni (Via dei
Condotti 61/a; % 06-697611) and Testa (Via Frattina 104, % 06-6791294)
are both men’s clothing specialists.
Don’t forget that Italy is famous for its leatherwork. For leather acces-
sories, head for Via dei Condotti; beautiful leather gloves can also be
found around Piazza di Spagna. For leather bags and wallets (if money
isn’t an issue), go to Prada (Via dei Condotti 88/90; % 06-6790897;
Metro: Line A to Spagna). For shoes, try Dominici (Via del Corso 14;
% 06-3610591), Ferragamo (Via dei Condotti 73–74; % 06-6798402),
and Ferragamo Uomo (Via dei Condotti 75; % 06-6781130).
For more relaxed and youthful shopping, head for the newly opened
Galleria Alberto Sordi, across from Piazza Colonna (it’s also right next
to La Rinascente, the department store mentioned earlier in this chapter).
This mall has many nice shops and two bars, one near each entrance:
Bar Tritone and Bar Trevi.
Via del Babuino and Via Margutta are the traditional locations of some
of the best — and priciest — antiques shops in town. Among the anti-
quarian and artwork shops in this area that merit a mention are Alinari
(Via Alibert 16/a; % 06-6792923; Metro: Line A to Spagna) and Fava
(Via del Babuino 180, % 06-3610807; Metro: Line A to Spagna), both 
selling artistic prints, the former specializing in Roman and the latter
in Neapolitan scenes. At these shops, you can be sure that the antique
you’re buying is really an antique.
Navona/Pantheon
The intricate medieval streets on the west side of the Corso hide a great
trove of elegant and original boutiques, and some of the oldest establish-
ments in Rome. Here, you find even more variety of goods, from old prints
to exclusive fashions, from books to antique furniture. The foot traffic is
often less heavy here than on the Corso, which on major shopping days
and holidays looks like New York’s Fifth Avenue around Christmastime.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 193

In these smaller shops, you can buy something that you’d never find at
home. Big Italian designer labels often turn up at U.S. discount stores, so
why not check out a smaller Roman designer store that you’ll never see
on the other side of the Atlantic? An elegant men’s store, Davide Cenci
(Via Campo Marzio 1–7; % 06-6990681; bus: Minibus 116 to Pantheon),
is popular with locals. Just a stone’s throw away is Tombolini (Via della
Maddalena 31/38; % 06-69200342), which carries handsome clothes
and shoes for women and men, with an emphasis on timelessly classic
styling rather than chic. However, if you really want to make your friends
green with envy, have a pair of shoes custom-made by Listo (Via della
Croce 76; % 06-6784567). For leather bags and wallets, Bottega Veneta
(Piazza San Lorenzo in Lucina 9; % 06-68210024; bus: 81 or minibus 116
to Piazza San Lorenzo) is famous for its beautiful woven leather designs,
often in rich and startling colors.
For high-quality prints, well-known shops are the famous Nardecchia
(Piazza Navona 25; % 06-6869318; bus: Minibus 116) and Antiquarius
(Corso Rinascimento 63; % 06-68802941; bus: Minibus 116), a nice shop
just across the street from the Palazzo Madama. At these shops, you find
higher-quality — and somewhat more reliable — articles than at the
nearby antiquarian book and print market (see earlier in this chapter).
Local Roman crafts do survive here and there, especially in the medieval
area around Piazza Navona. Here, you can find vimini (basketry) on
Via dei Sediari, ironwork on Via degli Orsini, and even reproductions
of Roman and Pompeian mosaics. For beautiful ceramic work, try the
Compagnia del Corallo (Via del Corallo 27; % 06-6833697), and for 
elegant wrought iron, head to Nicola Arduini (Via degli Specchi 12;
% 06-68805537). For handmade quality jewelry, check out the Bottega
Mortet (Via dei Portoghesi 18; % 06-6861629). For plasterwork, includ-
ing reproductions of antique designs (some objects are small enough
to take home; others can be shipped), visit the Laboratorio Marani
(Via Monte Giordano 27; % 06-68307866).
Rome’s most special source of intoxicants is Ai Monasteri (Corso
Rinascimento 72; % 06-68802783; bus: Minibus 116), off the east side of
Piazza Navona. Here, you can find the liqueurs, elixirs, and other alcoholic
concoctions that Italian monks have been making since the Middle Ages.
Another great place for wines and spirits is Trimani (see Chapter 16),
which also has a cafe where you can sit and imbibe.
Of course, it’s not always the case that you’re looking for something
Italian; the English Bookshop (Via di Ripetta 248; % 06-3203301; bus:
Minibus 117 or 119 to Piazza del Popolo) stocks a wide variety of
books in — you guessed it — English. The Libreria Babele (Via dei
Banchi Vecchi 116; % 06-6876628; bus: Minibus 116 to Via dei Banchi)
is Rome’s most central gay/lesbian bookstore. In addition, many of the
larger newsstands in the centro have English-language newspapers and
magazines as well as bestsellers in fiction and some classics.
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
194

Paper in various forms — colored, marbled, deckle-edged — is an Italian
specialty and can be found all over Rome. This is one of the most popu-
lar, portable, and affordable gifts for the folks back home. For especially
refined stationery and paper, go to Pineider, founded in 1774 (two loca-
tions: Via Fontanella Borghese 22, % 06-6878369, bus: Minibus 117 or 119
to the Corso at Via Tomacelli; and Via dei Due Macelli 68, % 06-6795884,
bus: Minibus 116, 117, or 119 to Via Due Macelli).
If you’re interested in antiques, Rome is the place to go, and Via dei
Coronari is Rome’s antiquarian headquarters. This street — and it’s not
short — is lined with antiques dealers, one shop after another on both
sides of the street. Whether it’s furniture, glass, lamps, armoires, or paint-
ings, you’ll find it here. And even if you aren’t planning on lugging home
a count’s antique bureau or a trestle table from a convent, the street is
basically like a museum where you can (if you have the money) buy the
exhibits.
Other shops in this area specialize in religious objects and attire (natu-
rally, shops selling similar fare are located in the Vatican area, near Cola
di Rienzo, discussed in the following section). Although you probably
don’t want to buy a cardinal’s outfit, you may want to choose among the
huge selection of figurines, bronzes, candleholders, paintings, crèches, and
other religious objects. Two good stores are Ghezzi (Via de Cestari 32;
% 06-6869744) and Salustri (Via de Cestai 11; % 06-6791587) nearby.
Cola di Rienzo
Although this area on the San Pietro side of the Tevere doesn’t boast the
luxury shops of Via dei Condotti, you can still find big names of Italian
fashion, and what’s more, it may even be affordable. This area is best
for clothes and is also excellent for shoes, with shops catering to every
level of price and style. Stores line both sides of Via Ottaviano and Via
Cola di Rienzo.
Although this is not a traditional area for artistic crafts, a handful of very
nice workshops here turn out high-quality goods, including the jewelry
at Carini (Piazza dell’Unitá 9; % 06-3210715) and handmade lace at
Ricami Italia Garipoli (Borgo Vittorio 91; % 06-68802196).
Proceeding farther toward the Vatican, near St. Peter’s Basilica itself,
you’ll find one of the largest religious-items shops in the city, Savelli, with
one location specializing in mosaics in Via Paolo VI 27 (% 06-68307437)
and another location right off the square, with a huge variety of other
objects (Piazza Pio XII; % 06-68806383).
Via Nazionale
Off Piazza della Repubblica near Stazione Termini and running down
toward Piazza Venezia, Via Nazionale used to be an elegant shopping
area, but the traffic noise — the street was a main connecting artery
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 195

between the train station and the centro — had driven away many cus-
tomers. Fortunately, Via Nazionale is now open only to buses and taxes,
which has reduced the deafening noise. The shops are varied, some
good and others less so. The revived area has attracted some big names
(perhaps fleeing the ridiculous rents of the Corso), but it is still frequented
more by Italians than by tourists. Known especially for leather goods,
this may be the best place to find that sleek number you really want
without going to Florence.
Trastevere
This romantic medieval area of Rome is mostly known for its restaurants
and night spots, but it’s also rich in workshops of artists and crafts-
people. Among the many great little shops and showrooms — some
of them have been there for decades, and others are new ventures —
you can find woodcarving at Laboratorio Ilaria Miani (Via degli Orti
di Alibert 13/A; % 06-6861366), stringed instruments at Mohesen
(Vicolo del Cedro 33; % 06-5882484), ceramics at Ceramica Sarti
(Via Santa Dorotea 21; % 06-5882079), and jewelry at Elisabeth
Frolet (Via della Pelliccia 30; % 06-5816614).
Via della Scala is almost wall-to-wall showrooms and workshops, from the
goldsmiths Massimo Langosco di Langosco (Via della Scala 77; % 06-
5896375) and Ferrone (Via della Scala 76; % 06-5803801) to the dress-
makers Scala Magica (Via della Scala 66; % 06-5894098) and Scala 14
(Via della Scala 14; % 06-5883580). It also has some great stores offering
craft items from other Italian regions, such as the Officina della Carta
(Via Benedetta 26; % 06-5895557), selling paper and leather goods in
the best Italian tradition; Pandora (Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere 6;
% 06-5895658), which carries a great selection of Murano glass and Italian
designer goods; Modi e Materie (Vicolo del Cinque; % 06-5885280), with
ceramics from the island of Sardinia; and Ciliegia (Via della Scala 5;
% 06-5818149), specializing in fashions from Positano, from handmade
sandals and dresses to curios. You’ll even find a nice English bookshop,
The Corner Bookshop (Via del Moro 48; % 06-5836942), and a shop sell-
ing sundials and other ancient time-measuring instruments, Guaytamelli
(Via del Moro 59; % 06-5880704).

n the following five itineraries, we make recommendations on how
best to spend your time in Rome and give you a few possible themes
to give your vacation focus. You may have limited time, or maybe you
just hate museums and being closeted indoors for hours, or perhaps
you have special interests that you’d like to satisfy during this visit.
No matter what your time restrictions or desires, we’ve got you cov-
ered in this chapter!
Rome in Three Days
So much to see, so little time! Here, we put together an itinerary for
seeing the best Rome has to offer without suffering total exhaustion.
This itinerary is a great introduction to a city for which, in the words
of the great Italian writer Silvio Negro, a lifetime is not enough to know.
Day 1
Start with an overview of the city to get your bearings and get a sense of
the flavor by taking the excellent ATAC bus tour (see guided tours in
Chapter 11). This tour will leave you hungry for more, but if you started
early, you still have time to take in a major sight before lunch. Make it the
beautiful Piazza del Popolo, and drop into Santa Maria del Popolo to see
the magnificent paintings by Caravaggio (see Chapter 11). Afterward, head
for Bolognese (see Chapter 10), an outstanding restaurant on the square.
After lunch, stroll to nearby Piazza di Spagna for the famous Spanish
Steps (see Chapter 11). Along the way, check out the shops on Via del

Babuino — a street lined with high-fashion and antiques stores — as
well as the other elegant shops of il Corso area, as in Via Margutta and
Via Frattina (see Chapter 12). Make your reservations for the Galleria
Borghese (see Chapter 11), and after your visit, walk through Villa
Borghese to the Pincio — it’s a beautiful walk, with a beautiful panorama
of Rome that lights up with gold at sunset. Have dinner — or at least an
aperitivo (predinner drink) — at the newly reopened La Casina Valadier
(see Chapter 10); then stroll to Fontana di Trevi (see Chapter 11), which
is beautifully lit at night. Have dinner at one of the many restaurants in
the area.
Day 2
Start your day with a visit to the Roman Forum, the Colosseum, and
another sight in the core area of Ancient Rome, such as the Trajan
Markets, the Palatine, the Capitoline Museums, or the Domus Aurea
(see Chapter 11). Have lunch in the area at the Hostaria Nerone or at
Pasqualino al Colosseo (see Chapter 10).
In the afternoon, cross the Tiber, and head for St. Peter’s Basilica. See as
much as you can there, including Castel Sant’Angelo and even part of
the Vatican Museums, although we recommend a minimum of three
hours for this museum. (You can always run swiftly through this mind-
boggling array of artworks directly to the Sistine Chapel, a do-not-miss
attraction.) If you have time before dinner, take a shopping break down
the Via Cola di Rienzo (see Chapter 12). You’ll be famished afterward;
luckily, the charming traditional tavern Dante Taberna de’ Gracchi is
not far away; even closer is the inventive La Veranda. Or head for the
picturesque nearby neighborhood of Trastevere, and dine at Checco er
Carettiere (see Chapter 10). Be sure to have a stroll to get a sense of this
delightful neighborhood.
Day 3
Start your third day with a visit to the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme
(make a reservation to see the Roman frescoes). When you’re finished,
take a bus to the centro, and visit the Pantheon (see Chapter 11); have
lunch in the Navona/Pantheon area (see Chapter 10).
In the afternoon, relax with a stroll and some shopping through the
area around Piazza Navona (don’t forget to look at what special
exhibits are on at the Museo di Roma), stopping for an espresso
at Antico Caffè della Pace (see Chapter 16) or a gelato at Giolitti
(see Chapter 10). Crossing Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, you come to
one of the most atmospheric squares in Rome, the Campo de’ Fiori
(see Chapter 11). Eat dinner at the nearby Bric, where you can savor
imaginative versions of Mediterranean cuisine, or try something differ-
ent: Da Giggetto, in the old Jewish quarter of the city. Or choose a truly
special restaurant for your last dinner in Rome (see Chapter 10). If you
still have steam (or if you’re a night owl), see the Colosseum lit up at
night as a final, indelible memory of Rome.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 199

Rome in Five Days
If you have five days in Rome, you can spend time absorbing or even pon-
dering the sights rather than just seeing them and moving on. You also
don’t have to make as many painful choices. You can begin with Day 1
as in the “Rome in Three Days” itinerary, earlier in this chapter, but then
take the second day of that itinerary and divide it into two days, so that
you can visit more attractions. Concentrate on the Rome of antiquity on
Day 2, and give the Vatican the attention that this massive sight deserves
on Day 3. Visit the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Palatine in the
morning of Day 2; then have lunch at one of the suggested restaurants
for that day. Afterward, continue with the Domus Aurea, the Trajan
Markets, and the Capitoline Museums — where you can also have a
great break at the beautiful terrace restaurant–cafe inside. For dinner,
head to the Testaccio, the most Roman of Roman neighborhoods, and
treat yourself to a lavish meal at Checchino dal 1887 or Al Regno di Re
Ferdinando II, two fine restaurants that occupy caverns dug out of the
Monte Testaccio (see Chapter 10 for more on these restaurants and the
hill made of pot shards). If you feel like burning the midnight oil, you can
stop in at Club Picasso, one of Testaccio’s hottest clubs (see Chapter 16).
But make sure you’re ready to head for the Vatican Museums early on
Day 3, when you can linger over the spectacular collection of art and
visit the Sistine Chapel as well. Have lunch in one of our recommended
restaurants in the area (see Chapter 10), and,\ once refreshed, resume
your visit with St. Peter’s Basilica and Castel Sant’Angelo. Those who
finish early can take a shopping break down the Via Cola di Rienzo
(see Chapter 12). For dinner, make it a panoramic treat at the elegant
La Pergola — you deserve it after an intense day of sightseeing.
For Day 4, follow Day 3 in the “Rome in Three Days” itinerary, earlier in
this chapter, which takes in the Palazzo Massimo and other sights. On
Day 5, head for the Appia Antica (see Chapter 11), or for something
even more out of the ordinary, take a boat on the Tiber early in the
morning to Ostia Antica (see Chapter 14). Have lunch near the attrac-
tions you choose. In the afternoon, return to Rome, and pick one of the
attractions you’re interested in but didn’t have time to visit. Leave time
in the late afternoon for some last-minute shopping and strolling in the
Eternal City. Toward evening, head for Trastevere, where you can find
not only excellent restaurants and nightlife (see Chapters 10 and 16,
respectively), but also great shopping (see Chapter 12).
Rome for Architecture Lovers
The Renaissance completely changed the face of Rome, leaving few
mementoes of Byzantine and medieval times, and shaping the city as
we see it today. The center of Rome has been little touched in later cen-
turies, because most modern development has taken place outside the
city walls — and of course, virtually everything in the center is now a
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
200

historic site. Splendid palaces and buildings await you at every street
corner, while large and tiny squares — sudden openings in the fabric of
narrow streets — surprise you with their beauty. If you love architecture,
Rome has more to offer than can be related in a few lines, but here are
the highlights.
Start with Michelangelo’s masterpiece the Piazza del Campidoglio,
defined by the three palaces that house the Capitoline Museums
(see Chapter 11) — surely one of the great architectural monuments
of Rome. Proceed to Piazza Navona, perhaps Rome’s most beautiful
square, lined by palaces and churches (keeping in mind that the shape
recalls the chariot-racing oval that was here millennia ago). Take a break
in one of the cafes in the square, or if you prefer something more solid,
head toward Campo de’ Fiori for lunch at Il Drappo for excellent Sardinian
fare (see Chapter 10).
After lunch, continue to nearby Piazza Farnese, graced by the superb
Palazzo Farnese, with its serene facade and gorgeous courtyard (visible
only through a gate at the back). From there, you can easily reach the
Galleria Spada, a little-known but gorgeous palace, still decorated in
Renaissance style and especially famous for housing Borromini’s
Perspective, a unique architectural trompe l’oeil (see Chapter 11).
Cross the Tiber over Ponte Sisto — an elegant Renaissance bridge
rebuilt in the 15th century with part of the ruined preexisting Roman
bridge — to reach the neighborhood of Trastevere. There, you’ll find the
Villa Farnesina, another lesser-known architectural marvel, graced by
a garden over the river (magnificent frescoes are displayed inside the
villa, too). You can finish your day with a stroll through Trastevere, a
wonderful neighborhood rich in medieval buildings and churches, where
the various architectural strata are often seen superimposed on one
another in buildings that have been built, adapted, and rebuilt again.
Be sure to see Santa Maria in Trastevere, a church begun in the third
century and one of the oldest in Rome. The neighborhood has great
shops and artist showrooms (see Chapter 12), as well as excellent
restaurants and nightlife (see Chapters 10 and 16, respectively).
Rome for Michelangelo Lovers
A splendid sculptor, an exquisite painter, and a masterly architect,
Michelangelo was extremely active in Rome, where the pope and
other wealthy families largely exploited his many talents.
Start with St. Peter’s Basilica, surmounted by the beautiful dome
Michelangelo designed but didn’t see finished — he died almost 30 years
before its quite-faithful completion by architect Giacomo Della Porta.
The basilica also houses the splendid Pietà, the sculptural masterpiece
of Mary and Christ, which Michelangelo carved between 1498 and 1500.
Continue to his crowning achievement and one of the most important
works in the history of Western culture: the Sistine Chapel, the pictorial
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 201

masterpiece at which he worked on and off for decades (between 1508
and 1512 for the ceiling and between 1535 and 1564 for the wall behind
the main altar). After taking in this awe-inspiring sight, cross the Tiber,
and head to Campo de’ Fiori for lunch (see Chapter 10).
After your break, stroll to nearby Piazza Farnese, where you can admire
the facade of Palazzo Farnese, which Michelangelo finished after the death
of the original architect, Sangallo the Younger. You can then proceed
to Piazza del Campidoglio, the square behind the monument to King
Vittorio Emanuele II, a great architectural achievement in large part 
following Michelangelo’s design (the 12-pointed star pattern set in the
pavement of the square signifies the 12 apostles). Today, the beautiful
palaces fronting the square house the Capitoline Museums. From here, it
is only a few bus stops to San Pietro in Vincoli, where you can admire the
artist’s monument to Pope Julius II, decorated with his famous sculpture of
Moses. You can then stroll up the hill — or take a couple of bus stops —
to Santa Maria Maggiore, where you’ll find a little-known architectural
marvel, the Cappella Sforza, designed and begun by Michelangelo but
completed well after his death. You can finish your tour with Santa Maria
degli Angeli, the church that Michelangelo created by reorganizing, with
great skill and respect for the original architecture, the well-preserved
ruins of the Terme di Diocleziano (Diocletian Baths). (See Chapter 11
for all the preceding attractions.) After seeing the sights, grab a pizza in
the neighborhood at Opera or Al Forno della Soffitta, or for a more sub-
stantial reward, visit Cesarina, another excellent restaurant not far away
(see Chapter 10).
Rome for Outdoors Lovers
If you love sports and outdoor activities, and you hate the very idea of
spending hours in an enclosed space such as a museum or a church, don’t
worry. Rome will surprise you, as it has done with her visitors century
after century.
Start your day bright and early by going to the Appian Way visitor center
(see Chapter 11) and renting bicycles there. Now you can proceed on
your exploration on wheels. You can take in some of the attractions
along the park of the Appian Way, or you can just enjoy the views of
the countryside — one of the last undeveloped places where it still
looks as the Ancient Romans must have seen it. Alternatively, you can
hike through antiquity, covering a couple of miles of ruins by crossing
what was the heart of Ancient Rome. Start with the Roman Forum and
the Colosseum; then climb the Palatino — ancient Rome’s most exclusive
residential hill — and come out on the other side at the Circo Massimo
(see Chapter 11), where you’ll see Romans jogging around what was a
chariot-racing track. Continue on (at this point, you’ll have covered a lot
of ground), and finish your day of sightseeing with the Caracalla Baths.
By this time, you should have worked up a hearty appetite; have lunch
in one of our recommended restaurants (see Chapter 10).
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
202

In the afternoon, tackle Renaissance Rome. Descend to the Tiber, where
you can take a boat ride and view the heart of Rome from the water;
then walk to Piazza di Spagna, where you can climb the Spanish Steps,
and head for the Pincio and Villa Borghese (see Chapter 11), enjoying
expansive vistas over the city. From here, you can rent a bicycle to
explore the park, row a boat on the small romantic lake — complete
with ruined temple — and even see Rome from a hot air balloon. Make
sure to be back on the Pincio at sunset to admire Rome’s gilded skyline
of cupolas and domes, and reward yourself with an excellent dinner
(see Chapter 10).

L
azio, the region surrounding Rome, is rich in beautiful and fascinat-
ing sites only a short drive from the capital. If you have the time,
stay a couple extra days in Rome and branch out from there for some
enjoyable day trips.
Ostia Antica: Rome’s Ancient Seaport
Southwest of Rome, toward the sea, is Ostia Antica, the archaeological
site of ancient Rome’s commercial harbor. This is a destination not
to miss — especially if you’re keen on antiquity. It is also an excellent
outing for kids, particularly if you get there by the very pleasant
boat cruise along the Tiber (see “Taking a tour,” later in this section).
The ruins are particularly attractive early in the morning or at sunset,
when many Romans like to come for an evening passeggiata (stroll).
It’s popular also on weekends for picnics, but most popular are the
shows — music and theater — held in the Roman Theater, the Teatro
Romano, in July.
The ancient city of Ostia served as a shipyard, a gathering place for the
fleet, and a distribution center for Ancient Rome. Founded in the fourth
century B.C. as a military colony for the defense of the river Tevere, Ostia
flourished for about eight centuries before being progressively abandoned
as a result of the silting up of the river and the spread of malaria in the
region (no longer a concern, fortunately).

Keep in mind that the ruins are incredibly hot in summer. They’re spread
across a flat plain, and shade is hard to come by. If you don’t like heat,
come early, end your visit just before lunch, and head elsewhere to dine.
Getting there
Ostia Antica is about 28km (16 miles) from Rome. It’s linked by train from
Stazione Ostiense (take Metro Line B to the Piramide stop, and follow the
signs for Ostia to your platform), with trains departing every half-hour
and costing about 1€ ($1.30) for the 25-minute trip. You can easily reach
the site on foot from the train station, which is across the street.

By far the most interesting way to get to Ostia Antica is by boat, as the
Ancient Romans would have done. The Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte
San Angelo (% 06-6789361 for reservations; info@battellidiroma.
it) runs morning cruises down the Tiber, with a two-hour stop in Ostia
Antica, for 10€ ($13) one-way, 11€ ($14) round-trip, and 35€ ($46) round-
trip plus buffet lunch during the return trip. Boats for Ostia Antica leave
the Marconi bridge at 9:15 a.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Important note:
A guided tour of the ruins is not included in the boat trip — you must
book your tour in advance directly with the office at the Archaeological
Area of Ostia Antica (see the following section).
Taking a tour
By far the best and most economical tour is offered by the Archaeological
Area of Ostia itself, led by licensed guides and art historians. You can book
a tour by calling or faxing the Archaeological Area at % 06-56352830
Tuesday through Sunday. You’ll meet your tour guide at the entrance to
the excavations.
If you prefer a commercial excursion, including transportation by bus
from Rome and entrance to the sights, we like Stop n Go/C.S.R. (Via Ezio
12; % 06-3217054; e-mail: csr@gisec.it). It organizes half-day tours of
Ostia Antica leaving Tuesday through Sunday at 9:30 a.m. from the Stop n
Go Terminal of Via Giolitti in Rome (on the side of Termini train station)
for 12€ ($16).
Seeing the sights
Ostia Antica includes a small medieval village, the Borgo Medievale di
Ostia Antica. Inside is the Castello di Giulio II (Julius II’s castle), built
in 1483 and one of the first examples of modern military architecture
(Piazza della Rocca; % 06-56358024; open Wed, Fri–Sun 9 a.m.–12:45 p.m.;
Tues and Thurs also 2:30–4:15 p.m.; free admission and guided tour).
Archaeological Area of Ostia Antica
Ostia Antica
The archaeological site covers the impressive excavations of the ancient
town of Ostia. The main streets of the town have been unearthed, as have
some of the principal monuments. After entering the site, on the right
you’ll find Via delle Corporazioni, leading to the Roman Theater (Teatro
Romano). Be sure to take note of the mosaics indicating the nature of the
businesses that once were housed along this street. The theater is still in
use today for performances of works by modern and ancient authors
during July as part of the Estate Romana (you can find details on the Web
at www.estateromana.comune.roma.it or by calling % 06-68809505;
Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.).
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
206

Returning to the main street and continuing ahead, you’ll find on your left
the Forum and behind it the Terme (thermal baths). Two temples are on
the left, and the Capitolinum is on the right. The site also includes many
interesting houses and buildings. The tourist office in Rome has a relatively
good map of the park. Allow a minimum of three hours for the visit, more
if you visit the museum. The Museum (Museo Ostiense) — conserving all
the material found during the excavations of the site — just opened its
doors after a restoration that lasted several years. The huge collection is
exhibited now in a modern and rational way, making it a pleasure to visit.
The entrance to the museum is within the excavations.
We definitely recommend taking an official guided tour; you’ll learn a lot of
interesting details, and what’s more, the guide can take you into areas of
limited access you couldn’t visit on your own. There are a new restaurant
cafeteria and a gift shop by the museum.
Viale dei Romagnoli 717, off Via Ostiense. % 06-56358099. For guided tours call % 06-
56352830. www.itnw.roma.it/ostia/scavi. Admission: 4€ ($5) including the
museum. Open: Excavations: Tues–Sun Jan–Feb and Nov–Dec 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Mar
8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; April–Oct 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Last admission 1 hour before closing
Nov–Mar and 90 minutes before closing Apr–Oct. Museum: Tues–Sun Jan–Feb and
Nov–Dec 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Mar 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Apr–Oct 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and
2:15–6:30 p.m.
Dining locally
With the reopening of the museum, the Ostia excavation site has also
gained a nice restaurant cafeteria, where you can get a simple meal at
a reasonable price, as well as beverages and ice creams, right inside the
exhibit area. This is a great solution, because there aren’t many dining
options near to hand.
Otherwise, the environs of the archaeological area hold only a small
restaurant and a bar in the village of Ostia Antica. You can do much better
in the nearby town of Ostia, where there are some excellent restaurants
overlooking the sea — or do as many Romans do, and bring a picnic lunch.

SEAFOOD
Very popular with the locals — and Romans who come here on weekends —
this is a typical seaside restaurant, offering a variety of excellent fish
dishes and more. The menu depends on the daily market, but you’ll usu-
ally find insalata di mare e di polpo (cold octopus, squid, and fish salad),
rigatoni ai gamberi rossi (pasta with large shrimp sauce), and a choice of
the now-fashionable crudi (raw fish).

to 3 p.m. and 7:30–10:30 p.m; winter daily noon to 3 p.m. and Mon and Wed–Sat
7:30–10:30 p.m.
Tivoli and Its Trio of Villas
Tivoli, a small town on a hill 32km (20 miles) northeast of Rome, is the
single best day trip from Rome in the summertime. The resort town
enjoys a cooler climate during the hot months of summer and has been
a traditional getaway for the wealthy and famous of Rome since ancient
times. Its three famous villas — one Ancient Roman, one baroque, and
one from the romantic period — reveal Rome’s architectural history as
it played out over almost 2,000 years.
Getting there
Trains leave Rome’s Stazione Tiburtina for Tivoli about every hour. The
ticket costs 2.50€ ($3.25) for the 40-minute trip. The Tivoli train station
is located outside the town center, and although the walk is not too long,
it is completely uninteresting because it crosses the new part of town.
You can as easily take a taxi — available just outside the train station —
to get to your destination; the fare to the center of town is about 4€
($5.25). You will definitely need a taxi to visit Villa Adriana (see later
in this chapter), because it is out of town.
Buses are also a good way to get to Tivoli. The bus company Linee Laziali
(% 0774-11137) offers frequent service from Ponte Mammolo in Rome.
You can also take Metro Line B to the last stop, Rebibbia (a 15-minute
trip); at the bus terminal outside the Rebibbia metro station, switch
to a COTRAL (% 0774-720096) bus for Tivoli. Buses depart about every
20 minutes for the 30-minute trip, and tickets cost $6€ ($8). Beware: Buses
operate less frequently on Saturday and quite infrequently on Sunday.
If you want to travel by bus on a Sunday, check the schedule in advance
to ensure that you’ll have a bus at a convenient time for your return.
A short drive — only 31km (20 miles) — from the capital, Tivoli lies at
the end of a very busy consular road, the Via Tiburtina, running north-
east of Rome and east of the Via Nomentana. Tivoli is like a suburb of
Rome, and many people commute to and from the city daily, so traffic at
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
208

peak hours can be horrible. And of course, when you get there, parking
is at a premium and can be quite costly. This makes driving to Tivoli an
unappealing proposition.
Taking a tour
If you sign up with a tour from Rome, you can avoid both the hassle of driv-
ing and the trouble of dealing with transportation in a foreign language.
A reliable agency that organizes excursions to Tivoli is Argiletum Tour
Operator (Via Madonna dei Monti 49, off Via Cavour; % 06-47825706;
www.argiletumtour.com). It runs a four-hour tour leaving Tuesday
through Sunday — in the afternoon in summer and in the morning in
winter — for 49€ ($64); price includes admission to Villa Adriana, Villa
d’Este, and Villa Gregoriana, and pickup from centrally located hotels.
Seeing the sights
The tourist office in Tivoli is in the central square of Largo Garibaldi
(% 0774-334522); summer hours are Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. and Sunday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. (in winter, it closes one hour earlier).
Although visiting the three villas will likely be the focus of your jaunt,
be sure to have a look at the town of Tivoli itself. The highlights are the
second-century-B.C. Tempio della Sibilla, on the Roman Acropolis (on
the other side of the Aniene River); the 12th-century churches of San
Silvestro (southwest of the Villa d’Este) and Santa Maria Maggiore; and
the 1461 Rocca Pia, Pope Pius II’s castle, which was turned into a prison
after 1870.
Villa Adriana
Hadrian, one of Rome’s “good” emperors, had this villa built between A.D.
118 and 138 as his holiday home. He spent the last three years of his life
here. The villa, placed on the site of a Roman villa from Republican times,
is magnificent, though it has lost its marbles, so to speak — many of its
sculptures are now conserved in Roman museums. Much of the marble
once covering the structures has gone because the estate was used as a
“quarry” during the Renaissance, as were many other Roman buildings,
like the Colosseum. In his villa, Hadrian wanted to be surrounded by the
architectural marvels he’d seen during his trips across the Empire: On the
300 acres of this self-contained world for his vast royal entourage, he con-
structed replicas of famous buildings of antiquity, such as the Canopus
(the Egyptian round canal ringed with statues) and the Lyceum (the
school of Aristotle), as well as temples and theaters, monumental thermal
baths, fountains and gardens, and a library. Although most of the monu-
ments are today in ruins, the effect is still impressive, and the atmosphere
that Hadrian cultivated is still intact in a mysterious way. For a glimpse of
what the villa looked like in its heyday, see the reconstruction at the
entrance. Kids love both the model and exploring the ruins of the park.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 209

Like any ruin in Italy, the villa gets very hot at midday during summer, so
the best times to visit are early in the morning or late in the afternoon.
Via di Villa Adriana, 5km (31⁄2 miles) from the center of Tivoli. % 0774-530203. Bus: 4 and
4X from Largo Garibaldi (the main square of Tivoli) to Villa Adriana. Admission: 6.50€
($8). Open: Daily Nov–Jan 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Feb 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Mar and Oct 9 a.m.–6:30 p.m.;
Apr and Sept 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; May–Aug 9 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes 11⁄2 hours
before close.
Villa d’Este
Built in 1550 by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este of Ferrara — the son of the noto-
rious Lucrezia Borgia and Alfonso I d’Este — this would be just another
beautiful 16th-century villa if it weren’t for its gardens. Designed by archi-
tect Pirro Ligorio, they are graced by a complex system of fountains — a
true masterpiece of hydraulic engineering. Using an underground spring
and the natural slope of the land, Ligorio managed to have naturally feed-
ing fountains, two of which are sonorous (the fountains are a sort of water
organ that makes “music”). The work is really magnificent and is enhanced
by the sculptural work of the fountains themselves: the Fontana
dell’Organo (Fountain of the Organ), by Claude Veanard; the Fontana
del’Ovato (Ovato Fountain), by Ligorio; and the Fontana del Bicchierone
(Fountain of the Big Glass), by Bernini himself. With all that water and
foliage, the gardens are incredibly refreshing in summer and a perfect spot
to be at midday on your visit to Tivoli. You can pick up an audio guide for
4€ ($5.25) at the entrance.
Piazza Trento, just west of Largo Garibaldi, the main square in the center of Tivoli. 
% 199-766166 within Italy and 0424-600460 from abroad. www.villadeste

8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Feb 8:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Mar 8:30–6:15 p.m.; Apr 8:30–7:30 p.m.;
May–last Sat in Sept 8:30 a.m.–7:45 p.m. Ticket booth closes 1 hour before close.
Villa Gregoriana
Villa Gregoriana, the latest of the three famous villas of Tivoli, was built in
the 19th century — but it isn’t a villa at all. In reality, it’s a beautiful garden
made to enhance the natural beauty of the gorges of the Aniene — the river
that meets the Tiber in Rome, where it makes some scenic waterfalls and
disappears underground for a short while (creating the grottoes, the Grotti
de Nettuno e Sirene). Pope Gregory XVI had a path carved all the way
down to the bottom of the ravine to allow him to admire the 90m (300-ft.)
waterfall, grottoes, and ponds. The deep slopes are covered with vegeta-
tion and mighty trees, making it a magical spot, especially in summer,
when it is a wonderful refuge from the heat. The park was closed for a
lengthy restoration, which has brought it back to its original splendor, and
has just reopened its doors.
Largo San Angelo, just north of Largo Garibaldi, the main square in the center of
Tivoli. % 0774-334522. Admission: 4€ ($5.25). Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and

Dining locally
Tivoli has a number of trattorie and restaurants that are Sunday
favorites for Romans on outings. 
Antica Hostaria de’ Carrettieri
$$
Villa Gregoriana
ROMAN/SARDINIAN
This old-fashioned restaurant serves excellent — and intriguing — food.
The menu places Sardinian specialties side by side with dishes true to the
strictest Roman tradition — that’s because the chef is originally from
Sardinia. The rigatoni all’amatriciana (pasta in a spicy tomato and bacon
sauce) is excellent, and so are the gnocchetti in salsa di formaggio piccante
(little potato dumplings with a spicy cheese sauce) and the tortino ai porri
(leek quiche).

Villa Gregoriana
ROMAN
Decorated with marble statues — the five statues in the restaurant’s name —
this reliable family-run restaurant offers typical Roman cuisine, such as
rigatoni all’amatriciana (pasta in a spicy tomato and bacon sauce) and
agnello alla scottadito (grilled lamb cutlets), which you can enjoy with a

Ristorante Adriano

Villa Adriana
ROMAN
“Countryside elegance” describes this tree-surrounded villa offering well-
prepared Roman specialties. Everything is homemade and delicious, from
the delicious pastas — try the cannelloni or the excellent fettuccine, ravioli,
and tortelli — to the desserts. For secondo, the local specialty is agnello con
le patate (roasted lamb with thyme and rosemary and new potatoes), which
is prepared to perfection, but the galletto alla diavola (spicy charbroiled
chicken) — a favorite of the movie director Federico Fellini on his visits
here — is also delicious. Hadrian’s Banquet, a sumptuous brunch, is offered
daily but is especially spectacular on Sunday. The restaurant is located in
the Alberto Adriana (see “Spending the night,” later in this section), and
it also has a cooking school with great classes.

The Castelli Romani and Their Wines
The hill towns surrounding Rome to the southeast are a favorite destina-
tion for locals — including the pope, who enjoys a magnificent villa in
Castel Gandolfo — to escape the summer swelter and enjoy excellent
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
212

wine and foodstuffs. Each town is dominated by its own castle — the
smallest is called a rocca — and is surrounded by fertile countryside,
the produce of which is masterfully prepared and served in the many
trattorie.
Each of the Castelli towns — Albano Laziale, Ariccia, Castel Gandolfo,
Frascati, Genzano, Grottaferrata, Lanuvio, Lariano, Marino, Monte
Compatri, Monte Porzio Catone, Nemi, Rocca di Papa, Rocca Priora,
and Velletri — could be a pleasant day trip on its own, but you might
also consider taking an overview tour of the area.
Getting there
The best way to visit the Castelli is by car. Driving allows you to visit more
than one of these attractive small towns. If you decide to rent a car, take
the Tuscolana out of Rome and follow it to Frascati; then continue with
the local road — almost a loop — to Marino on one side and Rocca di
Papa on the other. This route will take you through all the other Castelli.
You can also reach Marino from the Appia Nuova, taking a 41⁄2-mile detour
to the north. From the Appia, you can take another side road for Castel
Gandolfo. The Appia then continues to Albano, Ariccia, and Genzano.
If you don’t care for driving, a good alternative is taking an organized
tour (see the following section).
Some of the Castelli are also connected by train. Trains leave from
Rome’s Stazione Termini toward Albano Laziale, with stops in Marino
and Castel Gandolfo; separate lines run from Stazione Termini in Rome
to Frascati and to Velletri (the latter also stops in Lanuvio). They make
several runs per day and cost 3€ ($3.90). The trip from Rome takes about
30 minutes to Lanuvio, Marino, or Frascati; 40 minutes to Castel Gandolfo;
50 minutes to Albano Laziale; and 1 hour to Velletri.
You can also take a COTRAL bus (% 800-431784 toll free within Italy for
schedules). Buses leave from the Subaugusta and Anagnina (the last two)
stops on metro Line A for Albano every 20 minutes or so. Albano is the
hub for further service among each of the Castelli; you can catch COTRAL
buses from Albano to Nemi, Ariccia, Genzano, Marino, Grottaferrata, and
Frascati. Of course, the length of the trip will vary depending on your
destination, but all of the trips are under an hour. The price ranges from
3€ to 6€ ($3.90–$7.80).
Taking a tour
Argiletum Tour Operator (Via Madonna dei Monti 49, off via Cavour.
% 06-47825706; www.argiletumtour.com) organizes four-hour after-
noon tours in summer on Tuesday and Saturday for 37€ ($48); price
includes pickup from centrally located hotels.

Seeing the sights
The central tourist office for the Castelli Romani is in Albano (Viale
Risorgimento 1; % 06-9324081). Another large office is in Frascati
(Piazza Marconi 1; % 06-9420331). Both are open Monday through
Friday 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3:30 to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday 8 a.m. to
2 p.m. Some of the villages and small towns of the Castelli have little more
than a charming central square and a few good places to eat. In the rest
of this section, we describe the towns that are the most interesting.
Albano Laziale
Though it’s the most built up of the Castelli, Albano maintains its
unique charm. It’s the center of the area producing the table wine
Colli Albani, a pleasant white you often find in trattorie around Rome.
Albano was the site of an Ancient Roman town built along the Appian
Way — Ancient Rome’s Regina Viarum (the queen of all roads) — around
Emperor Domitian’s villa. Later, Emperor Septimius Severus housed
Roman legions here. The little town remained a village all throughout the
Middle Ages and the Renaissance, when wealthy Romans again started
building elegant villas in its countryside to enjoy the beautiful views
over the volcanic lake called Lago di Albano. During the 19th century, it
became a regular stop on the Grand Tour, the extended cultural pilgrim-
age through Europe that well-to-do young men and women traditionally
took at that time. Roman ruins abound — the Sepolcro degli Orazi e dei
Curiazi (Roman tomb), the Villa di Pompeo inside the Villa Comunale,
and the Nimpheus of the Villa di Domitziano — but the great attraction
is the volcanic lake formed by two craters, where you can enjoy a vari-
ety of watersports.
Ariccia
One of the most ancient towns in Latium, Ariccia was the seat of a sanc-
tuary dedicated to Diana, the hunting goddess, and was already active
before Rome became a republic. Ariccia originally lay along the Appian
Way, but it was moved to its current location at the top of the rocky cliff
during the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, quite ugly modern buildings have
been built around the historic center, but splendid treasures await those
who push through.
Ariccia became a key stop on the Grand Tour of Italy in the 18th cen-
tury, especially for artists, who came to enjoy the beauty of the place.
Particularly striking is Locanda Martorelli, in Piazza di Corte, which is
decorated with a cycle of paintings by the Polish painter Taddeo Kuntze.
Also on the square is Ariccia’s most famous attraction, the 17th-century
Palazzo Chigi. This grandiose villa belonged to the Chigi family until
1988, when it passed to the town, which started lengthy restorations.
Surrounded by a splendid garden, it was transformed into a baroque
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
214

marvel by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and now houses the Museum of the
Baroque, which can be visited daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Piazza di
Corte 14; % 06-9330053; www.palazzochigiariccia.it; admission:
4€/$5.20). Across from the palazzo is the church of the Assunta, the last
achievement of the great master. Bernini designed and built it with Carlo
Fontana, his pupil, who was also destined for much glory as an architect.
Inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, the round church was completed in
1664. The great viaduct over the valley to the historic center was built in
1854 but destroyed by the Germans during their retreat in 1944; it was
rebuilt in 1948.
Another important reason to visit Ariccia is the fraschette (small tav-
erns), often with outdoor dining areas, where you can sample local wine
and the town’s specialty: porchetta. Not to be missed, porchetta is a
whole (deboned) pig carefully roasted with herbs, and then sliced
and served with peasant bread. A porchetta sandwich is one of the
best “fast foods” you’ll ever have.
Castel Gandolfo
On the slopes of the beautiful Lago di Albano, Castel Gandolfo has a great
beach — bring your suit if you want to swim; your kids will love it — and
a very pleasant promenade along the lake. The town grew around the
12th-century castle built by the Roman family of the Gandolfi. Since
the 17th century, it has been the official summer residence of the pope.
The pope’s palace and villa (originally Villa Barberini, surrounded by
an enormous garden and built atop the villa of the Roman Emperor
Domitian), are still part of Vatican territory. The villa also houses the
Vatican Observatory, the oldest astronomical research institution in the
world. Obviously, you can’t visit the papal villa, but you can enjoy the
rest of the town, including Bernini’s San Tommaso di Villanova church
and his fountain on the main square, Piazza della Libertà. Just out of
town is the Villa Torlonia, in neoclassical style and decorated with
sculptures by B. Thorvaldsen.
Frascati
Frascati may be the most familiar of the Castelli towns for the famous
white wine produced in the surrounding countryside. Romans come
here to visit the various cantine (cellars), where you can sample the
wine and eat simple fare, such as porchetta and pecorino (sheep’s-milk
cheese), or a sandwich made with local bread and salami. The town
is dominated by the imposing 16th-century Villa Aldobrandini, set
atop a steep slope overlooking the main square. You can visit its
gardens daily from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. by getting a free ticket from the
tourist office on Piazza Marconi 1 (see “Seeing the sights,” earlier in
this section).
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 215

Genzano
Picturesquely situated above the Lago di Nemi, another crater of an
extinct volcano, Genzano is a charming small town surrounded by 
beautiful countryside. Its famous wine is not the only attraction in town;
among the highlights are the 17th-century Palazzo Sforza-Cesarini and
the nearby cathedral. Genzano’s main event is the Infiorata (literally,
“flowering”) — held one Sunday in spring when the main street is cov-
ered with a carpet of flowers. The wine is good here, and you’ll find a
few nice trattorie.
Marino
The closest of the Castelli to Rome (only 15 miles), Marino is a pleasant
small town, though the surroundings are modern and bland. The town
is most famous for its red wine, particularly enjoyable when it’s fresh.
On the occasion of the harvest celebration in October, the two main
Baroque fountains in town pour wine instead of water, to the great
delight of all. The rest of the time, you can sample it in the various
osterie and cantine in town — just look for the sign VINO!
Nemi
Nemi is a jewel of a small town. It has its own lake, the Lago di Nemi, on
the slopes of which are cultivated some of the best strawberries in the
world and certainly the best in Italy. Kids will love the opportunity to go
for a swim or a boat ride. Nemi also specializes in the production of salami,
sausages, pancetta (Italian bacon), and other mouthwatering items. Alas,
you can’t bring meat products back into the States, but that’s just one
more reason to sample them here. They keep quite well, and you can
include them in a future picnic during your trip.
Rocca di Papa
The town of Rocca di Papa, named after its castle, dominates the Lago di
Albano and enjoys breathtaking views of the surrounding hills. It’s worth
climbing the hill above the town to see the great vista; it’s now a park, and
all that’s left here is the ruin of an old albergo (hotel) where people once
came to eat and enjoy the pure air. The town below is quite picturesque.
The Chiesa dell’Assunta is a baroque church that was reconstructed
after an 1806 earthquake. Children will love the climb and the ruins, as
well as the chance to swim in the lake.
Velletri
This town was an important agricultural center in 63 B.C., when Emperor
Augustus was born here, and it remains so today. The historical center
of town is very pretty, with many baroque attractions, including the ele-
gant Piazza Cairoli. But the biggest attraction in town is in the cloister of
Velletri’s Cathedral, which houses the Diocesan Museum (Corso della
Part IV: Exploring Rome

Repubblica 347; % 06-9627217; www.museovelletri.com; open: Daily
10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.; admission: 2€/$2.60), a valuable collection
that includes precious objects and paintings by Gentile da Fabriano,
Antoniazzo Romano, and others.
Dining locally
The Castelli contains a procession of trattorie and ristoranti. They’re all
quite reliable, but keep in mind the rule of “trust the locals”: If it’s din-
nertime, and nobody is eating in a place, there must be a reason. We give
you some safe bets in this section, but just follow your nose to find some
of the other great places on your own.
The food in the Castelli is typically Roman, including fresh pasta and
grilled meats. People come to sample the variety of local salami and
cheeses, usually served as antipasto. Porchetta is a specialty of Ariccia
(see “Ariccia,” earlier in this chapter) but is prepared to some extent
everywhere in the Castelli. The wine of the Castelli is probably the best
in Lazio; particularly famous are the Frascati and the Marino (white and
red, respectively).

Tarquinia
The mother town of the Etruscan civilization, Tarquinia is famous for its
Etruscan archaeological remains, including well-preserved frescoes, but
it also holds a pretty medieval town with a pleasant seaside resort nearby,
Tarquinia Lido. You can easily visit its attractions in one day, but you
won’t be bored if you spend the night, especially during the good season,
when you can also go to the beach.
Getting there
About 90km (56 miles) north of Rome, Tarquinia is only about 10km
(6 miles) north of the town and bustling port of Civitavecchia, near the
coast. You can easily reach it by one of the trains, which depart every
hour on the hour from Termini station to Tarquinia; the trip takes 1 hour
and 24 minutes, and costs about 6€ ($8).
You can also reach Tarquinia by car from Rome in about 50 minutes by
taking the Via Aurelia, although we do not recommend it: The road is

narrow and winding, and people drive like maniacs. (It’s a route to Tuscany
and points north.)

The tour operator Dock&Discover (% 0766-581574; www.dockdiscover.
com) offers guided tours to Tarquinia starting from Civitavecchia. For a

plete list (IAT; Piazza Cavour 23; % 0766-849282; www.tarquinia.net).
Seeing the sights
Tarquinia was the most important town of the Etruscan kingdom and
an important commercial and artistic center that dominated central
Italy until the third century B.C., when it was taken over by the Romans.
Tarquinia is actually comprised of two towns: the original Etruscan 
settlement and modern-day Tarquinia, which was rebuilt on the neigh-
boring hill to the west of the ancient town in medieval times, leaving the
Etruscan archaeological site to await future exploration. The remains
of the ancient town are few but monumental, and the necropolis gave
an incalculable wealth of material for the understanding of the Etruscan
civilization. In the “new” town, the Castle of Matilde di Canossa is still
in good repair, and the Duomo has some nice frescoes from 1508. Lining
the main street in the historical center of town, you find artists’ and
craftsmen’s showrooms, particularly fine local goldsmiths and potters
who produce jewels and ceramics with an Etruscan flavor and design
(excellent gifts for others or souvenirs for yourself). Three miles out
of town to the west is the beautiful Lungomare of Lido di Tarquinia,
Tarquinia’s seaside resort, with pleasant restaurants overlooking the
sea, neat little shops, and a good beach.
Archaeological Area of the Civita
First settled around the ninth century B.C., the city was greatly enlarged
by the Etruscans, who built the acropolis in the seventh century B.C. The
Archaeological Area is partially surrounded by the original powerful city
walls from the fifth century B.C., of which you can still see several miles,
and including one of the main gates. The acropolis is graced by an impor-
tant temple from the fourth century B.C.: the Ara della Regina (Altar of
the Queen), the largest Etruscan temple in Italy. It measures 77m by 35m
(253 by 115 ft.) and was built over a temple. The base was decorated with
terra-cotta figures, including the famous winged horses that are now pre-
served in the National Museum of Tarquinia.
Pian della Civita, Montarozzi, 7km (3.5 miles) east of Tarquinia on the road to Monte
Romano. Free admission. Open: Sunrise to sunset.

Museo Nazionale Tarquiniense (National Museum)
One of the most important Etruscan museums in Italy, the National Museum
houses not only the extremely rich collection from the thousands of tombs
of the nearby necropolis, but also artifacts and remains from more-archaic
nearby sites, including some Villanovian burial sites that predate the
Etruscan period. The museum occupies the elegant Renaissance Palazzo
Vitelleschi from the 15th century, which would be worthy of a visit even if
it didn’t contain Etruscan treasures. Among the huge collection of unique
Etruscan objects — artwork, religious and everyday objects, bronze artifacts,
sculptures — the jewels and the ceramics are truly outstanding. However,
the stars of the show are the four tombs from the nearby necropolis, which
have been completely reconstructed with the original frescoes. The fresh-
ness of the paintings is extraordinary; you’ll find the Tomb of the Olympic
Games, the Tomb of the Ship, the Tomb of the Triclynium, and the Tomb
of the Racing Chariots, all from between the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.

Etruscan Necropolis
The necropolis, with its thousands of tombs, is located at the doors of the
Etruscan town, the Archaeological Area of the Civita. The tombs, some of
which are in outstanding condition and are considered to be the quintes-
sential examples of Etruscan tombs, date from between the sixth and first
centuries B.C. Fascinating frescoes, alive with color, decorate the tombs,
which are named for the subjects of the paintings; the most famous are
the tombs of the Panther, the Bulls, Hunting and Fishing, the Lioness, the

Nature Reserve of the Lago di Vico
Only 65km (40 miles) from Rome, the splendid Lago di Vico has escaped
the development afflicting other volcanic lakes near the capital. Tucked
among the scenic southern slopes of the Monti Cimini (Cimini Mountains),
the lake offers a perfect respite from the bustle of Rome. Fortunately,
Romans had the foresight to create a regional park with a nature reserve
to protect the area, and Lago di Vico is now the best preserved of the
volcanic lakes in central Italy. Nature isn’t the only attraction, though;
if you just aren’t satisfied unless you’ve gotten a cultural fix, you can
visit the beautiful Gothic Abbey of San Martino al Cimino near the park.
Together, both attractions will fill one day.
Getting there
We recommend renting a car to visit these sights. Public transportation
is available to the town of San Martino al Cimino, and you could hire a
taxi to take you around to the park, but it would be a cumbersome jour-
ney. The nature reserve is located on the north shore of the lake. Coming
by car from Rome, take Via Cassia (S.S. 2) toward Viterbo, and turn onto
Strada Provinciale (S.P.), following the signs for Ronciglione and then
Caprarola, where you’ll begin to see signs for the Riserva Naturale Parco
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
224

di Vico. Take S.P. 39, the Strada Provinciale Lago di Vico, a road circling
around the lake and the nature reserve. From the nature reserve, take
S.P. 81 another 16km (10 miles) to the small town of San Martino al
Cimino, located just north of the lake.
Taking a tour
Contact the tourist office APT (Palazzo Doria Pamphili, San Martino al
Cimino; % 0761-291000; www.tusciainforma.it) for a list of licensed
private guides to the park. Guides will design a tour appropriate to your
party’s interests.
Seeing the sights
The Cimini Mountains offer many surprises, not least of which are the
unspoiled blue waters of the Lago di Vico and the elegant and sober
architecture of the Cistercian Abbey of San Martino al Cimino. Be sure
to wear sturdy shoes for a hike in the park to take in the natural beauty,
and don’t forget your swimsuit for a dip in the lake afterward. If you’re
feeling more adventurous, you can rent mountain bikes and boats at La
Bella Venere, a resort on the beach of the lake doubling as hotel and
restaurant (see the listing later in this section).
Regional Park of Lake Vico
The park, established in 1982, covers over 3,300 hectares (82,000 acres)
and stretches along the slopes of the extinct volcano that form the lake.
Gorgeous beech woods, oaks, and chestnut trees of unusual height and
majesty (producing some of the best chestnuts in the world) complete the
splendid landscape of the lake. You can hike several trails through the
park, which are very popular, especially with bird- and wildlife-watchers.

Cistercian Abbey of San Martino al Cimino
The splendid baroque town of San Martino al Cimino is noted for its Gothic
abbey, a large monastery that serves as the mother house of the Cistercian
order in Italy. A small monastery existed on the site beginning before the
ninth century and was a Benedictine house dependent on the Abbey of
Farfa to the south. When the Cistercians — a French religious order — took
it over in the 12th century, they enlarged it according to a grandiose
design, which was completed in 1305. Inside, you can still see the splendid
cloister, two libraries, the abbot’s apartment, and the monks’ cells, as well
as the church, all in the sober and more austere Gothic style imported
from France.

Rome’s Nightlife

In this part . . .
S
till got some energy after a full day of sightseeing? Then
this part is for you! Here we offer suggestions for ﬁlling
those marvelous evenings in Rome, when the air is sweet and
soft and everything seems so romantic. Whether you want to
attend a performance or show (see Chapter 15) or take in the
atmosphere at Rome’s many bars and discos (see Chapter 16),
we’ve got your evening covered.

Chapter 15
Applauding the 
Cultural Scene
In This Chapter
 Finding out what’s going on around town
 Reserving tickets
 Attending the symphony, opera, and dance performances
R
ome offers some splendid opportunities for lovers of the perform-
ing arts. All major performers pass through Rome, and the city has
traditionally been the hot spot for theater production in Italy. Of course,
a moderate knowledge of Italian is required for theatergoing.
Getting the Inside Scoop
Rome’s cultural scene is very hot year-round, with top-notch performers
making tour stops here on a regular basis. The scene positively burgeons
in summer, though, when a mind-boggling range of performances is staged
throughout the city in various indoor and outdoor venues for the famous
Estate Romana (Roman Summer), discussed later in this section.
The newly opened Parco della Musica (Viale Coubertin 34; % 06-8082058;
www.auditorium.com; bus: M from Piazza del Popolo) — a daring, mod-
ernistic complex almost ten years in the making — is now the principal
venue for music in Rome, with several halls and a number of other attrac-
tions. Designed by the famous architect Renzo Piano, this grand, ambitious
project is probably the largest addition to the Roman cultural and archi-
tectural landscape in decades. Located 2km (11⁄4 miles) from Piazza del
Popolo and connected by a special bus line to the center (Bus M, for
music), the entire site takes up 55,000 square meters (13.6 acres). It has
three concert halls as well as other structures, including La Cavea, a
3,000-seat outdoor concert space reminiscent of a classical amphithe-
ater. In addition to classical, pop, and contemporary music, theater and
dance performances take place here. Restaurants, stores, lecture halls,
and a host of other activities and services are located on site.

Most other performance venues in Rome are in or near the city center.
The newly restored Teatro dell’Opera (Piazza Beniamino Gigli 1, just off
Via Nazionale; % 06-48160255; www.opera.roma.it; metro: Line A to
Repubblica; bus: Minibus 116 to Via A. Depretis) — a beautiful venue
built at the end of the 19th century — hosts opera as well as ballet and
classical concerts. The Teatro Olimpico (Piazza Gentile da Fabriano;
% 06-3265991; www.teatroolimpico.it; tram: 225 from Piazzale
Flaminio), another great space, hosts musical performances of all kinds.
From June through September — during the off season of many venues in
Rome — Roman nights come alive with Estate Romana (Roman Summer),
a series of musical, theatrical, and other cultural events (see also Chap-
ter 16). These often take place in some of the most picturesque locations
and monuments in Rome, lit up especially for the event, which transforms
the show into a multidimensional treat. Among the most impressive set-
tings for the festival is the Colosseum, which opened its doors to the
public again in 2000 after 15 centuries (don’t expect blood sports and 
severed limbs, however; civilization has changed somewhat in the
interim). Also very dramatic is the Theatre of the Caracalla Baths
(Teatro delle Terme di Caracalla, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla 52; 
contact the Teatro dell’Opera at % 06-48160255 for information), where
the Teatro dell’Opera holds some of its summer season. To hear Verdi’s
Requiem resounding at night through these cavernous, massive ruins is
a truly remarkable musical experience. Other unique venues for summer
events are the Roman Forum (Via dei Fori Imperiali; % 06-70393427);
Villa Borghese (Largo Aqua Felix, entrance at Piazzale delle Ginestre;
% 06-82077304 Mon–Thurs 9 a.m.–4 p.m. and Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m.); the 
elegant Chiostro del Bramante (Via della Pace; % 06-7807695); the 
suggestive Archeological Park of Teatro Marcello (Via del Teatro
Marcello; % 06-87131590); the mausoleum–cum–fort Castel Sant’Angelo
(Lungotevere Castello 50; % 06-32869 or 06-32861); and, outside Rome,
the Teatro Romano of Ostia Antica (Viale dei Romagnoli 717, Ostia Antica;
% 06-56352850). You can find details on the festival online at www.estate
romana.comune.roma.it (also in English) or get information by calling
% 06-68809505 Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The opera, classic concerts, and ballet always call for elegant dress, as
do the most famous theaters and even the best jazz clubs. More-casual
attire is okay for other venues and shows.
The curtain is usually right on time, and if you miss yours, you’ll usually
have to wait for the intermission to gain your seat; it’s also customary to
give a small tip to your usher.
Shows are usually late enough so that you can have a regular dinner;
because most venues are in the center of Rome, you can pick a restau-
rant in the area (see Chapter 10) and still make it to the show on time.
For after-theater restaurants, see the “After-theater dining” sidebar, later
in this chapter.

Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
Rome’s tourist office publishes an excellent monthly review of what
is going on in Rome called The Happening City; you can pick up an
English- or Italian-language copy at any of the tourist info points listed
in Appendix A and in Chapter 8, or you can request that it be e-mailed to
you before you leave (which would be the smart thing to do if you want
to order tickets in advance). Indeed, if you’re coming for only a short
vacation, you’ll do a lot better by ordering your tickets from home, espe-
cially for big performances that will be sold out or booked well before
your feet touch Italian soil.
We recommend using an Italian ticket service. TicketOne (% 02-392261
for an English-speaking operator; www.ticketone.it) and HellòTicket
(% 800-907080 toll free within Italy or 06-48078400 from abroad and
cellphones; www.helloticket.it) sell tickets for just about everything
in the country. You can make reservations and purchase your tickets
online through both services’ Web sites, but note that they are only in
Italian. Charta (www.charta.it) — an Italy-wide Internet-based agent
for theater, concerts, and dance — is also a good resource; its parent
site, Viva Ticket (www.vivaticket.it), is user friendly but again, only
in Italian so far, unfortunately.
Global Edwards & Edwards (% 800/223-6108 in the U.S.) is a good ticket
agency that’s based in England. And you’ll find that many U.S.-based
agencies offer advance-sale tickets for events in Rome, but none of them
is as comprehensive as the Italian services, and they add a steep service
fee over the actual price of the event. Nonetheless, if you want to use a
U.S.-based company, a good one is Culturalitaly.com (% 800/380-0014;
fax: 928/639-0388; www.culturalitaly.com), a Los Angeles–based Web
company where you can get tickets for a nice selection of events.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 233
After-theater dining
At least a couple of restaurants near each theater in Rome specialize in after-dinner
service. Showtime is usually late enough so that you can easily have an early dinner
anywhere, but if you want to do like the Romans (when in Rome . . .), try to resist until
after the show and check out one of the late-night spots.
Restaurants that stay open late among those we suggest in Chapter 10 are Bolognese,
Checchino dal 1887, Enoteca Capranica, Ferrara, and Gusto. You can also try Il
Boscaiolo (Via degli Artisti; %06-4884023), a very nice pizzeria behind the Teatro Sistina;
L’Archetto (Via dell’Archetto; % 06-6789064), a good spaghetteria only steps from the
Teatro Quirino; and Il Cantuccio (Corso Rinascimento 71; % 06-68802982), a restau-
rant serving good Roman fare not far from the Teatro Valle and the Teatro Argentina.

Once in Rome, you’ll find detailed listings of events for the day in daily
newspapers, and in the weekly publication Roma C’è — available in all
newsstands (it comes out on Wed) — which has a section in English.
You can also find information in the daily newspapers. Other sources
are the fortnightly magazine Wanted in Rome (www.wantedinrome.com),
which specializes in the city, and the monthly magazine The American
(www.theamericanmag.com), which covers all of Italy; both are in English
and have an online version as well. You’ll find them at most newsstands
in the historical center of the city. You can also pick up a copy of The
Happening City — or view it online at www.romaturismo.it; then click
Events in Rome and then Happening in Rome — an excellent review of
events published by Rome’s tourist board. For the events of the Estate
Romana festival, you can get details at the tourist points in town and also
online at www.estateromana.comune.roma.it (also in English) or by
calling % 06-68809505 Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Besides the resources listed in this section, your concierge at your hotel
will always be able to help you find out what’s on and purchase tickets.
Many venues offer reduced-price tickets and matinees on one specific
day of the week, often Thursday. For last-minute theater tickets at a dis-
count of up to 50 percent, you can go to the booth of Via Bari 20, off
Piazza Salerno (% 06-44180212; bus: 61, 490, 491, 495; metro: Line B
to Policlinico; open: Tues–Sat 2–8 p.m.).
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
Any given day in Rome, you’ll have a variety of shows to choose among.
Here, we highlight the main categories. During the summer, remember to
check with the tourist office for the special events of the Estate Romana
festival.
Symphony
A variety of classical concerts is organized in Rome on a daily basis; you
can check out programs with the tourist office and in the publications
we recommend (see the preceding section) or directly with each of the
following associations. The most important orchestras and associations
are the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (Parco della Musica, Viale
Coubertin 34; % 06-8082058; www.santacecilia.it), one of Italy’s
premier musical groups, offering classical concerts and events and 
holding a summer season during the Estate Romana (see earlier in this
chapter); the Opera di Roma (Teatro dell’Opera, Piazza Beniamino Gigli 1;
% 06-48160 or 800-016665 toll free within Italy; www.opera.roma.it);
and the Filarmonica di Roma, also called Accademia Filarmonica Romana
(Teatro Olimpico, Piazza Gentile da Fabriano; % 06-3265991; www.
teatroolimpico.it).
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Rome’s Nightlife 
234

Other important associations include the Amici della Musica Sacra (Via
Paolo VI 29; % 06-68301665; www.amicimusicasacra.com), Il Tempietto
(% 06-87201523; www.tempietto.org), the Orchestra di Roma e
del Lazio (% 06-9766711; www.orchestradellazio.it), and the
Fondazione Arts Academy Roma (% 06-44252303; www.artsacademy.
it). In addition to regular performance spaces, classical concerts are
held in churches and various halls all over the city. A particularly pleas-
ant series is the concerts of the Musici Veneziani in the Anglican church
of San Paolo entro le Mura (Via Nazionale 16 at the corner of Via Napoli;
% 06-4826296), with a repertoire of operatic arias — Verdi, Puccini,
Bizet, and Mozart, among others — with performers dressed in baroque
costumes. Concerts usually start at 8 p.m., and tickets range between
15€ and 30 € ($20–$40). Check with the tourist office for a complete
schedule of events.
Tickets prices vary according to the performance and, in the largest the-
aters, the quality of the seat, with prices ranging from free to 50€ ($65).
Opera
Opera is pretty much limited to the great national theater of the Teatro
dell’Opera (Piazza Beniamino Gigli 1; % 06-48160; www.opera.roma.it).
Its season runs from January to June, but it also has a not-to-be-missed
summer season during the famous Estate Romana (see earlier in this
chapter), with performances held at the Teatro delle Terme di Caracalla,
the theater situated amid the picturesque scenery of the Caracalla Baths.
Ticket prices range between about 30€ and 120€ ($40–$160), depending
on the seat and performance.
Dance
Ballet and dance performances are quite numerous in Rome and are often
of world-class quality. The Rome Opera Ballet performs classical and
modern ballet at the Teatro dell’Opera (see the preceding section for con-
tact information); international performers often stage their shows at the
Teatro Olimpico or the Parco della Musica (see earlier in this chapter).
Ticket prices vary according to the performance, the venue, and — in
large theaters — the quality of the seat, ranging between 10€ ($13) for a
performance at the Parco della Musica all the way up to 120€ ($160) for
the best seat at the Teatro dell’Opera.
Theater
Rome is famous for theater, and some of the best companies in the coun-
try and the world perform here. Italy has produced such playwrights as
Goldoni, Pirandello, and recent Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo. Of course, if
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 235

you don’t understand Italian, you won’t get much out of Roman theater —
but if you do know the language, you’ll be delighted by the number of
performances, from classical to contemporary. Fortunately, some shows
are in English, especially in the summer during the Estate Romana festi-
val (see later in this section).
The best theaters in Rome are the Teatro Argentina (Largo Argentina
52; % 06-684000345; www.teatrodiroma.net), Teatro Brancaccio
(Via Merulana 244, off Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore; % 06-47824893;
www.politeamabrancaccio.it), Teatro Ghione (Via delle Fornaci 37;
% 06-6372294; www.ghione.it), Teatro Quirino (Via delle Vergini 7,
near Fontana di Trevi; % 06-6794585; www.teatroquirino.it), Teatro
Valle (Via del Teatro Valle 21, near Piazza Navona; % 06-68803794;
www.teatrovalle.it), and Teatro Sistina (Via Sistina 129, off Via del
Tritone; % 06-4200711; www.ilsistina.com), but there are a great
number more, all quite good.
During the summer, many theater performances move outdoors for the
Estate Romana festival. One of the highest rated for tourists is the English
company The Miracle Players (% 06-70393427; www.miracleplayers.
org) performing in English at the Roman Forum (Via dei Fori Imperiali;
% 06-70393427). As the name suggests, the Toti Globe Theatre in Villa
Borghese (Largo Aqua Felix, entrance at Piazzale delle Ginestre; % 06-
82077304; www.globetheatreroma.com) is a replica of the famous the-
ater of Shakespeare in London, where the Toti performs Shakespeare as
well as other productions. The Teatro Romano of Ostia Antica (Viale dei
Romagnoli 717, Ostia Antica; % 06-56358041), a bit farther afield, is well
worth the trip. It always offers a summer season in the highly atmospheric
Roman theater within the archaeological site of the ancient seaport of
Ostia.
The newly opened Centrale RistoTheatre (Via Celsa 6, off Piazza del Gesu;
% 06-6780501; www.centraleristotheatre.com) is an ultramodern
restaurant–cabaret–theater hall presenting musical and theatrical per-
formances that you can enjoy over an aperitivo (predinner drink) and
a light snack or dinner. The dinner — with a weekly menu based on
Tuscan fare — is at 7:30 p.m., and the live show is at 10:30 p.m.
Ticket prices vary according to the performance and venue, but they
usually range from 12€ to 26€ ($16–$34).

Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
All That Jazz
Romans love jazz, and the city is home to many first-rate jazz venues 
featuring excellent local musicians as well as all the big names of the
international scene. Most clubs are in Trastevere and in Prati, and
open their doors around 10 p.m. and close around 3 a.m. Cover charges

vary depending on the event and the club, but they usually range
between 7€ ($9) for a regular night all the way up to 30€ ($39) for 
special concerts.
The most famous jazz clubs are the Alexanderplatz (Via Ostia 9, just off
the Musei Vaticani; % 06-39742171; www.alexandreplatz.it; metro:
Line A to Ottaviano/San Pietro; bus: 23 to Via Leone IV), where reserva-
tions are recommended; Big Mama (Vicolo San Francesco a Ripa 18 in
Trastevere; % 06-5812551; www.bigmama.it; metro: Piramide; tram: 8),
which attracts both small and big names in jazz and blues, and is some-
what more expensive, depending on how bright the star is; and the
Fonclea (Via Crescenzio 82/a, behind Castel Sant’Angelo; % 06-6896302;
www.fonclea.it; bus: 23 to Via Crescenzio), where the emphasis is on
jazz, but it also has some excellent ethnic and other concerts. Another
great place for jazz, a bit out of the city center, is the La Palma Club
(Via Giuseppe Mirri 35; % 06-43599029; www.lapalmaclub.it), not
far from the Tiburtina train station, seat of the popular Fandango Jazz
Festival in June and July.
In addition to jazz and contemporary music, you may hear traditional
Italian songs at Arciliuto (Piazza Montevecchio 5; % 06-6879419; bus:
62 or 64 to Corso Vittorio Emanuele), located in the maze of streets
behind Piazza Navona. Unfortunately, it’s closed most of the summer,
but then you can enjoy the many jazz events of the Estate Romana (dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter), usually including Fiesta! (Ippodromo
delle Capannelle, Via Appia Nuova 1245; % 06-7182139), with Latin
American jazz, and the concerts of Villa Celimontana (Via della
Navicella; % 06-7182139).
Historic Cafes
Rome boasts many famous old cafes that have never lost their glamour.
Although some are protected historical sites, they still operate as regu-
lar bars (Rome-style; see Chapter 10), opening early in the morning —
usually by 7  — and closing around 9 or 9:30 p.m. They are all in the his-
torical center of town.
Very pleasant, if a little expensive, the Antico Caffè della Pace (Via della
Pace 3–7; % 06-6861216; bus: Minibus 116 to Piazza Navona) is one of
the most popular cafes in the city, where you can linger at outdoor tables
opening onto a romantic little square. Another sought-after spot is the
beautifully furnished Caffè Greco (Via Condotti 84; % 06-6791700; metro:
Line A to Spagna); among its customers were famous writers like Stendhal,
Goethe, and Keats. Also noteworthy is the Caffè Rosati (Piazza del
Popolo 4–5; % 06-3225859; bus: Minibus 117 or 119), which retains its
1920s Art Nouveau décor. Tre Scalini (Piazza Navona 30; % 06-6879148;
bus: Minibus 116) is a perfect spot for people-watching while having a
drink or an ice cream. It’s famous for tartufo — ice cream coated with 
bittersweet chocolate and topped with sour cherries and whipped
cream — but the regular gelato is nothing to rave about.

Wine Bars and Pubs
Rome has many a fine enoteca (wine shop), a very popular hangout
place for young and not-so-young Romans. Some of them are regular
wine shops that turn into wine bars–cum–restaurants after 8 p.m.
(and sometimes also at lunch, between 1 and 3 p.m.). Others are wine
bars that open exclusively in the evening, usually from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.
but sometimes even later. They’re scattered everywhere in Rome, with
some of the most popular located in the centro, in particular the Pantheon/
Navona, Colosseo, Trastevere, and Campo de’ Fiori areas.
The granddaddy of Roman wine stores, Trimani (Via Goito 20; % 06-
4469661; www.trimani.com; bus: 60 or 62; closed Sun and Aug) has been
run by the same family since 1821 and is lodged in the old residential
neighborhood behind the Terme di Diocleziano. In addition to selling
thousands of bottles of wine, Trimani is a happening wine bar. Across
town, the exceedingly popular but old-fashioned wine bar called Vineria
(Campo de’ Fiori 15; no phone) still holds its own amid the nightly crowds
swarming this trendy piazza, popular with all age groups. For something
calmer, try the wine bar at Gusto (see Chapter 10), which has an intimate,
romantic atmosphere.
Not an enoteca but an American-style bar with a DJ, the Drunken Ship
(Campo de’ Fiori 20; % 06-68300535) is often jammed with people. This
is the place where every American student doing his or her year abroad
will eventually turn up — be warned or informed, as the case may be.
The European Economic Union has had a very definite impact on nightlife:
The Italian craze for Irish pubs has hit Rome very hard. These are among
the nicest ones: Mad Jack (Via Arenula 20, off Largo Argentina; % 06-
68808223; tram: 8) is the place for Guinness and a choice of light food; it
also features live music on Wednesday and Thursday. The Abbey Theatre
Irish Pub (Via del Governo Vecchio 51–53, near Piazza Navona; % 06-
6861341; bus: 62 or 64 to Corso Vittorio Emanuele II) is in the oldest part
of town, and features authentic décor and souvenirs from the famous the-
ater of Yeats, J. M. Synge, and Lady Gregory. The Albert (Via del Traforo
132, off Via del Tritone, before the tunnel; % 06-4818795; bus: Minibus
116, 117, or 119 to Largo del Tritone) is not an Irish pub at all but deserves
mention: It provides a real English-pub atmosphere and beer, with every-
thing from the furnishings to the drinks imported from the old country.
Dance Clubs
Romans, especially the younger set, love dancing, and clubs abound.
You can hear a mixture of live and recorded music at Alpheus (Via del
Commercio 36, near Via Ostiense; % 06-5747826; bus: 23, but best to
take a cab). Several halls offer different kinds of music, from jazz to Latin
to straight-ahead rock, so if you don’t want to dance, you can actually
find comfortable places to sit and have a drink while listening. Alien
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 239

(Via Velletri 13–19; % 06-8412212; www.aliendisco.it; bus: 490 to
Piazza Fiume) continues to work at its reputation as Rome’s clubbiest
club — with mirrors, strobe lights, and a New York–style atmosphere
appealing to a frenetic twentysomething crowd. Not to be outdone in the
club-as-phenom category is Gilda (Via Mario de Fiori 97; % 06-6797396;
www.gildadiscoclub.it; metro: Line A to Spagna), which caters to an
older crowd and plays classic rock as well as some newer stuff.
In Testaccio, clubs come and go, but the neighborhood remains one of
the preeminent Roman hot spots. Club Picasso (Via Monte Testaccio 63;
% 06-5742975; metro: B to Piramide) has blasting music — from rock to
blues — for most of the night.
During the summer, the Estate Romana festival (see earlier in this chap-
ter) provides additional dancing venues, including on a barge on the
Tiber and on the terraces and gardens of monuments around town.
Cover charges hover between 10€ and 20€ ($13–$26) for the most ele-
gant and hippest venues. They usually open around 10:30 p.m. and close
around 4 a.m.
Gay and Lesbian Bars
Rome has a lively gay scene, which becomes positively sizzling in
summer with Gay Village (% 340-5423008; www.gayvillage.it), a
special section of the Estate Romana festival that includes music and
theater performances, as well as disco dancing and other entertainment.
Gay clubs are scattered around the city, although lately, the area between
San Giovanni and the Colosseo has been developing as a gay enclave; they
observe the same hours as other clubs and discos in town, from around
10 p.m. to around 4 a.m. Cover charge usually runs about 10€ ($13).
The hottest gay club in Rome is Alibi (Via di Monte Testaccio 40–44;
% 06-5743448; www.alibionline.it; nus: 23 or tram 3 to Via
Marmorata and then walk down Via Galbani, though taking a cab is best),
with a rotating schedule of DJs and a great summer roof garden. The gay
disco Angelo Azzurro (Via Cardinale Merry del Val 13 in Trastevere;
% 06-5800472; tram: 8 to Viale Trastevere at Piazza Mastai) welcomes
all ages and offers an eclectic mix of music. Admission is free, and Friday
night welcomes ladies only.
The leading lesbian club is New Joli Coeur (Via Sirte 5; % 06-86215827;
bus: 56 or 88 to Piazza Sant’Emerenziana); it’s nonexclusive and wel-
coming too. The club is only for women on Saturday nights, but all
are welcome at other times.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
H
ere we add some special details that we hope will make
your vacation even more successful and memorable.
Think you can make do in Rome knowing only ten Italian
words? Believe it or not, it’s possible, and we get you started
in Chapter 17. In Chapter 18, we list ten of the greatest Roman
artists and point you to where you can ﬁnd their art and archi-
tecture. In Chapter 19, we suggest ten great purchases to serve
as a beautiful reminder of your visit to the Eternal City.

Chapter 17
Non Capisco: The Top 
Ten Expressions 
You Need to Know
In This Chapter
 Using salutations
 Asking questions
 Memorizing some lifesavers
T
raveling in a country where you don’t know the language can be
intimidating, but trying to speak the language can be amusing at the
very least. Although you can get by in Rome without knowing Italian,
locals often appreciate it if you at least make an effort to speak to them in
their native tongue. And we think you’ll find that Italian is a fun language
to speak.
Per Favore
Meaning “please,” per favore (per fa-voe-ray) is the most important
expression you can know. With it, you can make useful phrases such
as Un caffè, per favore (“A coffee, please”) and Il conto, per favore
(“The bill, please”). There’s no need for verbs, and it’s perfectly polite!
Grazie
Grazie (gra-tziay) means “thank you”; if you want to go all out, use
grazie mille (mee-lay), meaning “a thousand thanks.” Say it clearly and
loudly enough to be heard. Saying grazie is always right and puts people
in a good mood. Grazie has other uses as well: Italians often use it as a
way to say goodbye or mark the end of an interaction. It’s particularly
useful when you don’t want to buy something from an insistent street
vendor: Say “Grazie,” and walk away.

Permesso
Meaning “excuse me” (to request passage or admittance), permesso
(per-mess-ow) is of fundamental importance on public transportation.
When you’re in a crowded bus and need to get off, say loudly and clearly,
“Permesso!” People will clear from your path (or feel less irritated as you
squeeze your way through). The same thing applies in supermarkets,
trains, museums, and so on. Of course, you may be surrounded by non-
Italians, and the effect may be a little lost on them.
Scusi
Scusi (scoo-sy) means “excuse me” (to say you’re sorry after bumping
into someone) and is more exactly mi scusi, but the shortened form is
the one more people use. Again, it’s a most useful word in any crowded
situation. You’ll note that Italians push their way through a narrow pas-
sage with a long chain of “Scusi, permesso, mi scusi, grazie, permesso. . . .”
It’s very funny to hear. Scusi has another important use: It’s the proper
beginning to attract somebody’s attention before asking a question. Say
“Scusi?”, and the person will turn toward you in benevolent expectation.
Then it’s up to you.
Buon Giorno and Buona Sera
Buon giorno (bwon djor-know), meaning “good day,” and its sibling
buona sera (bwon-a sey-rah), meaning “good evening,” are of the utmost
importance in Italian interactions. Italians always salute one another
when entering or leaving a public place. Do the same, saying it clearly
when entering a store or restaurant. Occasionally, these words can also
be used as forms of goodbye.
Arrivederci
Arrivederci (ah-rree-vey-der-tchy) is the appropriate way to say goodbye
in a formal occasion — in a shop, in a bar or restaurant, or to friends.
If you can say it properly, people will like it very much: Italians are aware
of the difficulties of their language for foreigners.
You’ll hear the word ciao (chow), the familiar word for goodbye, used
among friends (usually of the same age). Note that using the word ciao
with someone you don’t know is considered quite impolite!
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
244

Dov’è
Meaning “where is,” dov’è (doe-vay) is useful for asking for directions.
Because the verb is included, you just need to add the thing you’re looking
for: Dov’è il Colosseo? (“Where is the Colosseum?”) or Dov’è la stazione?
(“Where is the train station?”). Of course you need to know the names
of monuments in Italian, but don’t worry! We always give you the Italian
names in this book. It makes things much easier when you’re there!
Quanto Costa?
Meaning “how much does it cost?”, quanto costa? (quahnn-tow koss-tah)
is of obvious use all around Italy for buying anything from a train ticket
to a Murano glass chandelier.
Che Cos’è?
Meaning “what is it?”, che cos’è? (kay koss-ay) will help you identify
something before you buy it. It is particularly useful in restaurants and
grocery stores, but it also may come in handy in museums and other cir-
cumstances. But then the tricky part begins: understanding the answer.
If you don’t understand the answer, you can get the person to repeat it
by saying the next phrase on our list. . . .
Non Capisco
Non capisco (nonn kah-peace-koh) means “I don’t understand.” There’s
no need to explain this one: Keep repeating it, and Italians will try more
and more imaginative ways to explain things to you.

Chapter 18
Ten Great Roman Artists
In This Chapter
 Identifying Rome’s great sculptors, painters, and architects
 Discovering great women artists
A
lthough hundreds of books have been written about the great fig-
ures of Italian art, few have focused specifically on Roman artists.
However, most great Italian artists spent time in this great city, at least
for a time, because so much art was — and still is — produced here.
Moreover, Rome gave birth to a number of important artists and, what is
most interesting, to some of the first professional women artists in the
Renaissance. These women’s work is all over the city, decorating some
of the most important monuments you’ll see, but their names are often
obscure except to art historians because of the overshadowing reputa-
tions of the great names from the rest of the country.
We chose ten of the best Roman artists — men and women — and list
them in order of chronology, but we left behind many whose names
you’ll encounter over and over during your visit, such as Giuseppe
Chiari (1654–1727), Giovanni Odazzi (1663–1731), Michelangelo Cerruti
(1663–1748), and Marco Benefial (1684–1764) for the Renaissance and
baroque, as well as the internationally known modern painters Giuseppe
Capogrossi (1900–1972) and Toti Scaloja (1914–1998).
Pietro Cavallini
Considered the Roman Giotto for medieval painting, Pietro Cavallini
(c. 1250–1344) was a very active painter and mosaic designer of great skill.
A marvelous artist, his documented and still extant work includes the
splendid mosaic in the apse of Santa Maria in Trastevere (see Chapter 11).
Although many of his frescoes have been lost — as is the case for Giotto —
we know he decorated the inner facade of St. Peter’s and the main nave of
San Paolo Fuori Le Mura. In that basilica, you can still admire his mosaic
on the facade, as well as the Christ in the main nave and the crucifix in
the Cappella del Santissimo. Among his other works in Rome, some of
the best are the Giudizio Universale (Last Judgment) on the inner facade
of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, and the frescoes and decorations of the
Cappella Savelli in Santa Maria in Aracoeli, which are unfortunately par-
tially ruined (see Chapter 11).

Jacopo Torriti
Active during the same period as Cavallini (see the preceding section),
Jacopo Torriti was also a great mosaic designer and painter, although
much less innovative than his colleague. We can still admire the mosaics
in the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore and the Enthroned Virgin in the chapel
dedicated to Santa Rosa in Santa Maria in Aracoeli (see Chapter 11).
Antoniazzo Romano
Antonio di Benedetto Aquilio degli Aquili (c. 1430–1512) rapidly became
the leading painter of the Roman school in the 15th century. He devel-
oped a highly refined painting technique, especially for tempera. Indeed,
some of his work is exhibited in major international museums, including
his Madonna di Leone IX in the National Gallery in Dublin, his Madonna
at the Detroit Institute of Arts, and his triptych in the Prado of Madrid.
He was very active in Rome, where you can see his splendid frescoes
in the Camera di Santa Caterina in the church of Santa Maria sopra
Minerva; his Nativity in the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica in Palazzo
Barberini; his Madonna del Tribunale della Sacra Rota in the Pinacoteca
Vaticana at the Vatican Museums; and his Madonna in San Paolo Fuori
Le Mura (see Chapter 11).
Giulio Pippi
Also known as Giulio Romano (c. 1492–1546) because of his Roman birth
and training, Pippi worked with Raphael in the Vatican and was deeply
influenced by the greater painter but quickly developed his own personal
style. He was often called on to finish and complement some of Raphael’s
work, such as the frescoes in the Villa Farnesina in Trastevere and the
Sale di Costantino in the Vatican. He also worked extensively in Mantova
for the Gonzaga family. His work is all over Rome; in addition to his fres-
coes in the Vatican and the Villa Farnesina, you can see his Virgin with
Child and St. John in the Galleria Borghese (see Chapter 11).
Cavalier d’Arpino
Also known as Giuseppe Cesar (1568–1640), this artist’s Roman birth
is not certain — some think he may have been born in Arpino, near
Frosinone, where he spent some of his childhood. In any case, he was
back in the city at the age of 14 to work as a painter helper in the Vatican,
and was quickly promoted and started getting his own commissions,
gaining increasing fame. He worked mostly in Rome but also in Naples,
where he frescoed the choir in the Carthusian Monastery of Saint Martin.
His elegant Mannerist style modernized with naturalistic elements made
him a favorite painter in 16th-century Rome, and he was often called in
by Pope Clement VIII. You can see many of his works around the city,
Chapter 18: Ten Great Roman Artists 247

including the frescoes in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Capitoline
Museums), the transept of San Giovanni in Laterano, the lunettes
over the main altar and in the cupola of the Cappella Paolina in Santa
Maria Maggiore, and the vault of the Cappella degli Olgiati in Santa
Prassede. Some of his best paintings are in museums in Rome, such
as his Annunciazione in the Pinacoteca Vaticana (Vatican Museums),
his Diana in the Pinacoteca Capitolina (Capitoline Museums), and his
frescoes at the Galleria Borghese (see Chapter 11).
Artemisia Gentileschi
Born into a life of art — she was the daughter of Orazio, a painter of the
Caravaggio school — Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1652) started in the
profession working with her father but soon obtained her own commis-
sions in Rome and elsewhere in Italy — churches in Naples; paintings
in Rome, Florence, and Venice — and even abroad, including in England
for King Charles I. She is a great figure both in art and in the history of
women. A professional painter at a time when women painters were rare
and confined by rigid convention to doing portraits and still-lifes, she
tackled mythological and religious subjects, producing work that holds
its own in comparison with that of other artists of her period. She has
been the subject of many books, most recently Artemisia: A Novel, by
Alexandra La Pierre.
Among her work in Rome, you can see her Cecilia and a Madonna and
Child at the Galleria Spada and self-portraits at the Galleria Nazionale
d’Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini (see Chapter 11).
Plautilla Bricci
Lesser known, Plautilla Bricci (1616–1690) has her place in history as
being the first woman architect in Rome and in the Western world. She
practiced mostly in Rome, both in secular and religious architecture.
Among her remaining work in the capital, you can admire the chapel
dedicated to San Luigi in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi, near the
Pantheon, where she also painted the great San Luigi IX over the altar.
Pietro Bracci
Considered the greatest sculptor of the 18th century and of the baroque
period, Pietro Bracci (1700–1773) produced work of powerful expression
and grace. He became a master in the use of colored marble, which he
used to highlight and provide background for his figures. Among his
best works in Rome are the Neptune and the Tritons in the Trevi foun-
tain; the monumental tomb of Benedict XIII in the church of Santa Maria
sopra Minerva; the statues of angels over the portico of Santa Maria
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
248

Maggiore; the tomb of Benedict XIV; and the monument to Maria
Clementina Sobieski (wife of James Francis Stuart, who would have
been James III of England if the Jacobites had had their way) in
St. Peter’s Basilica (see Chapter 11).
Giuseppe Valadier
A great architect and urbanist, Giuseppe Valadier (1762–1839) made an
important contribution to the reshaping of the Eternal City in the early
19th century. He is considered one of the greatest neoclassical archi-
tects; he also was an archaeologist and was responsible for the restora-
tion of several monuments in Rome. His greatest work is the
transformation of Piazza del Popolo, crowned by the elegant building
named after him, La Casina Valadier (now a restaurant; see Chapter 10).
Among his other works are the Teatro Valle (see Chapter 15), the reor-
ganization of Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano (see Chapter 11), and the
retracing of Via Flaminia.
Duilio Cambellotti
A multifarious artist, Duilio Cambellotti (1876–1960) is one of the great-
est figures of the modern style of Art Nouveau. He began his career as an
illustrator and in that field produced much work of great expressional
intensity — such as his famous illustrations for the Alinari edition of
Dante’s La Divina Commedia in 1901, in perfect Liberty (Italian Art
Nouveau) style. He also was a scenographer, a landscape designer, and
an interior decorator and designer, and he tackled most other artistic
media at one time or another — his artistic glass windows are beautiful.
It is, however, as a sculptor that we love him the most. The majority of
his work is in private collections and buildings, but you can admire his
frescoes on the vaults of the two small halls in Castel Sant’Angelo off the
Sala delle Colonne and some of his glasswork in the Museum of the
Casina delle Civette in Villa Torlonia (see Chapter 11).

From Antique Prints to
Cardinal Socks: The 
Best Roman Souvenirs
In This Chapter
 Enjoying Rome’s finest art galleries and antiques shops
 Shopping for fashion, jewelry, and fine lace
 Finding unique religious souvenirs
You won’t have to look very long to find fabulous things to buy in
Rome — not only those special items with a century-long tradition
in the city, but also the best crafts and art produced elsewhere in Italy.
Whether you plan to spend $8 or $8,000, you’ll have no problem finding
something that’ll remind you of your trip and bring beauty to your
home or to the home of a relative or friend (see Chapter 12 for store
addresses).
A little note: We’ve excluded food specialties from this list because of the
many Customs exclusions on foodstuffs and because most packaged
edible Italian specialties are sold in gourmet specialty stores worldwide.
Antique Prints
Rome is known for its beautifully executed prints and engravings, usually
of classic subjects such as monuments, landscapes, and ruins. Whether
you’re in the market for valuable antique prints or less-expensive newer
prints from antique engraving plates, you won’t have any trouble finding
a wide selection. If purchased without a frame, prints can be easily
transported and make excellent gifts.

Art
Rome is not only a great city in which to view art, but also a great city in
which to buy art. Numerous young artists and well-established pros have
showrooms and studios in Rome, and welcome visitors to browse — and
purchase — their works. Even if you decide to go out empty-handed,
you’ll have a lot of fun just looking.
Crafts
Il centro served as a headquarters for craftsmen for centuries, and
although high rents and other factors have greatly reduced the number
of artisans, you can still find some who learned their trade the traditional
way: from their fathers. Among the traditional items are wrought iron,
basketry, and ceramics.
Fashion
Of course, you could fill your suitcases with designer fashions almost
anywhere you go in Italy, but Rome has all the great names of Italian 
pret-a-porter, as well as lesser-known (and, thus, less expensive) designers
producing unique and fashionable clothes. And the great thing about
Rome is that it isn’t only for girls; a great number of splendid shops are
completely devoted to men’s fashion needs.
Gold Jewelry
Goldsmiths have an ancient tradition in Rome, and you’ll find — especially
in the medieval streets of Trastevere, but also elsewhere in the city —
skilled artisans who have been at their work for decades. Some follow the
inspiration of antiquity and produce Roman- or Etruscan-styled jewels;
others have chosen modernity and explore aesthetics from another end.
No matter what your tastes, you’ll certainly find something to your liking.
Handmade Paper Goods
Romans have a true love for stationery, and the city boasts a sophisti-
cated selection of wonderful and sophisticated paper. Even if you use
e-mail for most of your correspondence, you may find yourself yearning
to put pen to paper when you see the thick, cream-colored, handmade
stationery or agendas and scrapbooks lined with handmade marbleized
paper (a technique, by the way, that was invented either in Florence or
Venice). Whether shopping for yourself or someone else, stationery
makes a fine Roman souvenir.
Chapter 19: The Best Roman Souvenirs 251

Lace and Embroideries
Although Rome is not the most famous Italian source for laces and
embroideries (that title belongs to Venice), and the craft has almost 
disappeared from the city, a few stores keep the tradition alive.
Popular items include exquisite handkerchiefs, tablecloths, bedsheets,
and children’s clothing.
Murano Chandeliers and Sardinian Pottery
If you can’t find enough Rome-made specialties to satisfy your needs,
a number of showrooms in town showcase the best arts and crafts
Italy has to offer. All the greatest specialties are represented, from artis-
tic Venetian glass to brightly colored hand-painted Positano ceramic.
What better place than Rome, the heart and marketplace of the Italian
peninsula for over 2,000 years, to find an Italian souvenir?
Plaster Reproductions
Because so many artworks and so many artists concentrate in Rome,
and because Rome is also the seat of a great number of art schools, the
traditional art of plaster reproductions has been maintained over the
centuries, and you can still find specialized laboratories selling the 
perfect copy of Michelangelo’s Pietà or of a Roman bust. Smaller repro-
ductions make great gifts and souvenirs, and if you decide you can’t live
without a copy of the Pietà or some other large statue, you can always
have it shipped to your home.
Religious Paraphernalia
Even if you’re not religious, you may be drawn to the many faith-based
souvenirs available in Rome, from beautifully bound Bibles to religious
paintings, carvings, and figurines — some truly exquisite. And if you don’t
feel too blasphemous, religious attire has a quaint attraction: You can
purchase beautiful red socks (made for cardinals) and superbly embroi-
dered items.

dards and that are local calls from anywhere
in Italy.
ATMs
ATMs are available everywhere in the cen-
ters of towns. Most banks are linked to the
Cirrus network. If you require the Plus net-
work, your best bet is BNL (Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro), but ask your bank for a list of
locations before leaving on your trip.

Currency Exchange
You can find exchange bureaus (marked
CAMBIO/CHANGE/WECHSEL) everywhere in the
center of Rome and at points of entry such
as major train stations; the cambio/change/
wechsel at Fiumicino airport usually offers
the best rates in town.
Customs
U.S. citizens can bring back $800 worth of
merchandise duty free. You can mail your-
self $200 worth of merchandise per day and
$100 worth of gifts to others — alcohol and
tobacco excluded. You can bring on the
plane 1 liter of alcohol and 200 cigarettes or
100 cigars. The $800 ceiling doesn’t apply
to artwork or antiques (antiques must be at
least 100 years old). You’re charged a flat
rate of 10 percent duty on the next $1,000
worth of purchases — for special items, the
duty is higher. Make sure that you have your
receipts handy. Agricultural restrictions are
severely enforced: no fresh products, no
meat products, and no dried flowers; other
foodstuffs are allowed only if they’re canned
or in airtight sealed packages. For more
information, contact the U.S. Customs
Service, 1301 Pennsylvania Ave. NW,
Washington, DC 20229 (% 877/287-8867),
and request the free pamphlet “Know
Before You Go,” which is also available
for download on the Web at www.
customs.gov.
Canadian citizens are allowed a CAN$750
exemption and can bring back duty free
200 cigarettes, 2.2 pounds of tobacco,
40 imperial ounces of liquor, and 50 cigars.
In addition, you’re allowed to mail gifts to
Canada from abroad at the rate of CAN$60
a day, as long as they’re unsolicited and
don’t contain alcohol or tobacco (write on
the package “Unsolicited Gift, Under $60
Value”). Declare all valuables on the Y-38
form before your departure from Canada,
including serial numbers of valuables that
you already own, such as expensive foreign
cameras. You can use the $750 exemption
only once a year and only after an absence
of seven days. For more information, con-
tact the Canada Border Services Agency
(% 800-461-9999 from within Canada, or
204-983-3500 or 506-636-5064 from outside
Canada; www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca).
There’s no limit on what U.K. citizens can
bring back from an EU country, as long as
the items are for personal use (this includes
gifts) and the necessary duty and tax have
already been paid. However, Customs law
sets out guidance levels. If you bring in
more than these levels, you may be asked
to prove that the goods are for your own
use. Guidance levels on goods bought in
the European Union for your own use are
800 cigarettes, 200 cigars, 1 kilogram of
smoking tobacco, 10 liters of spirits, 90 liters
of wine (of this, not more than 60 liters can
be sparkling wine), and 110 liters of beer.

Australian citizens are allowed an exemp-
tion of A$400 or, for those under 18 years
of age, A$200. Personal property mailed
back home should be marked “Australian
Goods Returned” to avoid payment of duty.
On returning to Australia, you can bring
in 250 cigarettes or 250 grams of loose
tobacco and 1.125 milliliters of alcohol.
If you’re returning with valuable goods
you already own, such as foreign-made
cameras, you should file Form B263. A help-
ful brochure, available from Australian
consulates or Customs offices, is “Know
Before You Go.” For more information, 
contact Australian Customs Services,
GPO Box 8, Sydney NSW 2001 (% 02/9213-
2000 or 1300/363-263 within Australia or
612/6275-6666 from outside Australia;
www.customs.gov.au).
New Zealand citizens have a duty-free
allowance of NZ$700. If you’re over 17, you
can bring in 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or
250 grams of tobacco (or a mix of all three
if their combined weight doesn’t exceed
250 grams), plus 4.5 liters of wine and beer
or 1.125 liters of liquor. New Zealand cur-
rency doesn’t carry import or export
restrictions. Fill out a certificate of export,
listing the valuables you’re taking out of
the country. (That way, you can bring them
back without paying duty.) You can find the
answers to most of your questions in a free
pamphlet available at New Zealand con-
sulates and Customs offices: “New Zealand
Customs Guide for Travelers, Notice no. 4.”
For more information, contact New Zealand
Customs, The Custom House, 17–21
Whitmore St. Box 2218, Wellington (% 04-
473-6099; www.customs.govt.nz).
Doctors
Contact your embassy or consulate to get
a list of English-speaking doctors or den-
tists. You can also ask the concierge at
your hotel. For any emergency, go to the
emergency room of any nearby hospital
(see “Emergencies,” later in this appendix).
Electricity
Electricity in Rome is 220 volts. To use
your appliances, you need a transformer.
Remember that plugs are different too:
The prongs are round, so you also need
an adapter. You can buy an adapter kit in
many electronics stores before you leave.
Embassies and Consulates
Rome is the capital of Italy and, therefore,
the seat of all the embassies and con-
sulates, which maintain a 24-hour referral
service for emergencies: United States
(% 06-46741), Canada (% 06-445981),
Australia (% 06-852721), New Zealand
(% 06-4402928), United Kingdom (% 06-
7482441), Ireland (% 06-6979121).
Emergencies
For an ambulance, call % 118; for the fire
department, call % 115; for the police, call
% 113 or 112; for any road emergencies,
call % 116.
Hospitals
The major hospitals in the historic center
are the Santo Spirito (Lungotevere in
Sassia 1; % 06-68351 and 06-68352241 for
first aid), and the Fatebenefratelli on the
Isola Tiberina (Piazza Fatebenefratelli 2;
% 06-68371 or 06-6837299 for first aid).
Hotlines
For drug intoxication, call % 06-3054343 or
06-490663. The Children Hotline (Telefono
Azzurro) is % 19696 toll-free for children;
adolescents and adults can call at
199151515. The tourist information hotline
at % 06-36004399 will provide round-the-
clock information on just about anything in
four languages, including English.

Internet Access and Cybercafes
The ever-expanding Easy Everything has
a big Internet access point at Piazza
Barberini 2, open 24 hours a day 7 days a
week, and with 350 computers. Internet
Train has several locations, including Via
Pastini 125, near the Pantheon; Via delle
Fornaci 3, near San Pietro; Via Merry del
Val 20, in Trastevere; and Via in Arcione
103 by Fontana di Trevi. Netgate (www.
thenetgate.it) has several locations
around Rome, and more are on the way;
the most central are Piazza Firenze 25
(% 06-6893445) and Via in Arcione 103
(% 06-69922320). Near Termini, behind the
Terme di Diocleziano, is Freedom Traveller
(Via Gaeta 25; % 06-47823862; www.
freedom-traveller.it).
Language
Romans speak Italian, and although many
know a bit of English, it isn’t widely under-
stood. Luckily, you can survive in Rome with
very little knowledge of the Italian language
(see Chapter 17 for a few choice terms),
especially because Romans tend to be very
friendly and ready to help foreigners in dif-
ficulty. However, you’ll greatly enhance
your experience if you master a dozen or
so basic expressions. Good places to start
your studies are the glossary in Appendix
B and, if you’re really serious, the excellent
Italian For Dummies (Wiley).
Liquor Laws
There are no liquor laws in Italy. However,
there are laws against disturbing the quiete
pubblica (public quiet) — getting drunk and
loud in bars, streets, and so on. There are
also laws against littering — and drinking a
can of beer while sitting on a bit of Ancient
Roman wall is considered littering. Romans
consider public drunkenness disgraceful,
and though they love wine, they very much
frown upon drinking to excess. You can buy
alcohol in all supermarkets and grocery
stores, as well as in specialized wine stores;
all are open usually from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
and 4 to 7 p.m. (Groceries are closed
Thurs afternoons.)
Mail
Mail in Italy used to be notoriously unreli-
able, and many tourists still prefer to use
the Vatican post office (by the entrance to
the Vatican Museums) while they’re visit-
ing St. Peter’s in Rome; it’s the same price
as Italian post offices but somewhat faster.
Note, though, that you can mail letters with
Vatican stamps only from the blue mailboxes
in the Vatican.
Italian mail has gotten a lot better with the
introduction of Posta Prioritaria (express/
priority). A letter to the United States costs
0.80€ ($1.05) and can take as little as four
to five days to get there. Be aware, though,
that postcards are always sent via the
equivalent of U.S. third-class mail and will
take a long time to arrive; if you want your
postcards to arrive fast, slip them in an
envelope and send them letter rate. Also,
make sure you put your mail in the right
mailbox: The ones for international mail
are blue, whereas the red ones are for
national mail, and sorting will take longer.
The new priority mail also applies to pack-
ages; however, it’s expensive, and you may
be better off using a private carrier like
UPS or DHL, which will guarantee your
delivery, especially for valuables.
Maps
You can find free maps at the tourist infor-
mation points (see “Where to Find More
Information,” later in this appendix). If you
want something more detailed, you can
buy maps at newsstands and kiosks
around Rome. Get a map with a stradario
(street directory); one of the best, albeit a
bit bulky, is Tutto Città, which costs about
8€ ($10) and is a largish booklet with a full
street directory.

Pharmacies
Pharmacies are usually open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
again from 4 to 7:30 p.m. A few pharmacies
are open all night: Piazza dei Cinquecento
49, at Termini Station (% 06-4880019);
Via Cola di Rienzo 213 (% 06-3244476);
Piazza Risorgimento 44 (% 06-39738166);
Via Arenula 73 (% 06-68803278); Corso
Rinascimento 50 (% 06-68803985); Piazza
Barberini 49 (% 06-4871195); and Viale
Trastevere 229 (% 06-5882273). 
Police
To call the police, dial % 113 or 112.
Post Office
The central post office in the historic center
is located at Piazza San Silvestro 19, not
far from Piazza di Spagna. You’ll also find
post offices in Via di Porta Angelica 23,
near San Pietro, and in Viale Mazzini 101
in the Cola di Rienzo area. They’re open
Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to
1 p.m. For information, call % 800-160000
toll free within Italy.
Restrooms
Some public toilets are scattered around
town, but not many. You can find one out-
side the Colosseum across the road toward
Via Labicana and another one halfway up
the steps from Piazza del Popolo to the
Pincio, on the left side. Facing San Pietro,
you can find toilets under the colonnade
on the right. Make sure you have some
change to tip the attendant. Your best bet
may be to go to a nice-looking cafe
(though you have to buy something, like
a cup of coffee, to use the restroom).
Safety
Rome is a very safe city except for pick-
pockets. Pickpockets concentrate in
tourist areas, on public transportation,
and around crowded open-air markets
like the Porta Portese. One area that gets
somewhat seedy at night is behind the
main rail station Termini.
If you’re a pretty young woman traveling
alone, you’ll attract men’s attention —
some may even approach you and try to
charm you. However, it’s unlikely that
someone will touch you, let alone harm
you. Still, it’s a good idea to ignore and
avoid eye contact with anyone who
approaches you. The way you dress some-
times has an effect. Romans have a stricter
dress code than Americans do, and people
tend to dress more conservatively. You can
either dress however you feel like dressing
(and steel yourself for the occasional look
of disapproval or suggestive remark) or
adapt your mode of dress to fit in with local
traditions — the choice is yours.
Smoking
In 2005, Rome passed a law outlawing
smoking in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you
want to smoke at your table, call before-
hand to make sure the restaurant or cafe
you’ll be visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes
Refer to Chapter 12 for VAT information.
Taxis
If you need a taxi, call % 06-88177,
06-6645, 06-4994, 06-5551, or 06-6545 for
radio taxi service; you can also go to the
many stations scattered around town at
major squares and stations.
Telephone
To call Italy from the United States, dial the
international access code, 011; then Italy’s
country code, 39; then the area code for
the place you’re calling (06 for Rome, 0774
for Tivoli, and so on); and then the regular
phone number. Note that cellphone numbers
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 257

do not begin with a 0, nor do special phone
numbers such as toll-free numbers (mostly
starting with 800) and paying services.
To make a call within Italy, remember to
dial area codes (including the 0) for every
call, even local calls. All public pay phones
in Italy take a carta telefonica (telephone
card), which you can buy at a tabacchi
(tobacconist, marked by a sign with a
white T on a black background), bar, or
newsstand. The cards can be purchased
in different denominations, from 2.58€ to
7.74€ ($3.35–$10). Tear off the perforated
corner and stick the card in the phone, and
you’re ready to go. A local call in Rome
costs 0.10€ (13¢).
To call abroad from Italy, dial the interna-
tional access code, 00; then the country
code of the country that you’re calling
(1 for the U.S. States and Canada, 44 for
the U.K., 353 for Ireland, 61 for Australia,
64 for New Zealand); and then the phone
number. Make sure that you have a high-
value carta telefonica before you start;
your 5€ won’t last long when you call
San Diego at noon. Lower rates apply after
11 p.m. and before 8 a.m. and on Sunday.
The best option for calling home, though, is
using your own calling card linked to your
home phone. Some calling cards offer a
toll-free access number in Italy; others do
not, and you must put in a carta telefonica
to dial the access number (you’re usually
charged only for a local call or not at all).
Check with your calling-card provider
before leaving on your trip. You can also
make collect calls. For AT&T, dial % 800-
1724444 and then your U.S. phone number
area code first; for MCI, dial % 800-905825;
and for Sprint, dial % 800-172405 or 800-
172406. To make a collect call to a country
other than the United States, dial % 170.
Directory assistance for calls within Italy is
a free call: Dial % 12. International direc-
tory assistance is a toll call: Dial % 176.
Remember that calling from a hotel is con-
venient but usually very expensive.
Time Zone
In terms of standard time zones, Italy is six
hours ahead of eastern standard time in
the United States: When it’s 6 a.m. in New
York, it’s noon in Italy. Daylight saving time
goes into effect in Italy each year from the
last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in
October.
Tipping
Tipping is customary as a token of appreci-
ation as well as a polite gesture on most
occasions. A 10 to 15 percent service
charge is usually included in your restaurant
bill (check the menu when you order — if
the service is included, servizio incluso will
be marked at the beginning or at the end),
but it is customary to leave an additional 5
to 10 percent if you appreciated the meal;
if the service is not included, leave 15 to
25 percent. In bars, leave a 5 percent tip at
the counter and a 10 to 15 percent tip if you
sit at a table. Bellhops who carry your bags
will expect about 1€/$1.30 per bag, and
you may want to leave a small tip for the
maid in your hotel; cab drivers will expect
10 to 15 percent of the fare.
Transit Info
The local public transportation authority
(bus, tram, and subway) is ATAC (% 800-
431784 or 06-46952027; www.atac.roma.
it). For railroad information, call Trenitalia
(% 892021; www.trenitalia.it).
Weather Updates
Before you go, you can check a local
Web site such as http://meteo.
tiscalinet.it or one of the U.S.–based
ones, such as www.cnn.com. When you’re
in Italy, your best bet is to watch the news
on TV (there’s no telephone weather
number as there is in the U.S.).
