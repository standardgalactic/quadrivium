Foreword
We’ve come a long way from the vision of building a Community Platform. While 
we are all thrilled with the success the product has had, we are not nearly satisfied 
and have many more plans for the platform. In fact, we at Telligent believe we have 
created an entirely unique and new type of solution: a "Community Management 
System", although the acronym CMS is already taken!
Communities are becoming an increasingly important tool for organizations to use 
to support their products and initiatives. Communities help you understand and 
connect to people, such as Microsoft’s use of forums.xbox.com as a community for 
supporting the millions of Xbox gamers. Communities allow you to participate in 
discussions about your company, people, and products such as Dell’s Direct2Dell.
com blog. Communities also enable you to create vital tools for talking to customers 
without spending money on marketing campaigns. 
Community Server is the platform that enables all of these scenarios and this book 
will help introduce you to Community Server and impart the knowledge you need to 
build a community solution.
In this book, Anand Narayanaswamy will walk you through all of the various 
capabilities of Community Server, such as how blogs, forums, photo galleries, and 
file sharing can be used. He will also impart to you some tips & tricks for configuring 
your Community Server application. More importantly, this book will serve as a 
handy guide if you are implementing Community Server for your organization.

As I write this foreword our development team is hard at work on version 3.0 of 
Community Server. The goal for Community Server 3.0 is to greatly simplify the 
themes engine and to ensure that anyone can make changes to the user experience 
using simple What You See Is What You Get editors without any knowledge of ASP.
NET, CSS, or HTML. At the same time we will not compromise on the platform 
and Community Server will continue to be a reference software solution that 
demonstrates best practices for writing software on Microsoft’s .NET platform.
With that I present to you this book and hope to see you online at www.
communityserver.org.
Thank you,
Rob Howard

Preface
Community Server is an award-winning solution for setting up online communities. 
It includes a suite of integrated applications, which includes blogs, discussion 
forums, photo and file galleries, reader, and roller, which together can help you 
create your community presence. Community Server is the trusted solution for 
many organizations including Microsoft, Dell, Conde Nast, Match.com, and others. 
You can learn more about Community Server, and see it in action, at 
http://www.communityserver.org.
Written in a clear and concise manner, this book will guide you through the 
installation, administration, customization, and deployment of a Community Server 
solution. With the help of this book you will be able to start using your Community 
Server site within minutes of its installation. The book kicks off with a brief overview 
about the evolution of Community Server, its various editions, and installation 
procedures, and then delves deep into the creation and management of its 
integrated applications.
The later chapters of the book explore the different ways you can customize your 
Community Server site along with comprehensive coverage of add-ons and modules. 
You will also learn how to manage your Community Server license and other 
related settings. 
What This Book Covers
The Community Server platform is introduced in Chapter 1 and we look into the 
evolution of Community Server and various applications available with it. Keeping 
in mind the nature of tasks that lie ahead, this chapter also discusses various editions 
and licensing options that will help you to choose the right Community Server 
platform for your use. Finally it outlines some of the key features of the upcoming 
Community Server 3.0.

Preface
[  ]
Everything that you require to execute Community Server on a development 
machine is discussed in Chapter 2. The steps required for download and installation 
of Community Server are explained in depth. The chapter also lists the steps 
required to configure your installation and describes the various options found in the 
Control Panel.
One of the greatest features available with Community Server, blogs, is explored in 
Chapter 3. It examines how to create and manage blogs to publish content with the 
help of a sample blog. It also explains how to configure blogs for registered users.
Community Server has a fully featured discussion forum. Chapter 4 teaches you how 
to create forum groups ������������������������������������������������������������
so that you can file each forum under the appropriate group 
and create a sample forum. After creating ���������������������������������������
forums the chapter covers making posts 
and also how to manage and administer these forums.
Chapter 5 shows you how to add a gallery to your Community Server. You will learn 
how to create photo and file galleries and manage them with the help of sample 
photo and file galleries. 
Chapter 6 explains the powerful reader and roller features of Community Server. 
By implementing reader and roller functionality in your site, you can keep track of 
content of the other blogs using RSS feeds.
Chapter 7 looks at management of site members, their profiles, resetting passwords, 
and managing roles, cookies, and avatar settings.
The standard look and feel of Community Server gets a face-lift in Chapter 8. It 
gives you a run down of how attractive Community Server can be through the use 
of themes and also explains how to make important modifications to your chosen 
theme. It also teaches you how to use add-ons and modules, and to include custom 
links in the navigation bar of the site.
Chapter 9 gives you the edge when it comes to managing various Community Server 
settings. It explains the management of different settings associated with RSS, 
post, date, time, and email. At the end of the chapter you learn how to track the IP 
addresse��������������������������������������������
s of visitors to your Community Server site.
Chapter 10 takes you one step further by looking at the reporting functionality. This 
chapter shows you how an administrator can generate and view not only ������������
user, blog, 
and forum activity reports ��������������������������������������������
 but also different types of exceptions and 
jobs reports.
Chapter 11 delves into monetizing your site by advertising through Google AdSense 
and Amazon affiliate programs. It further discusses the management of licenses, 
word filters, spam blocker, member points, emoticons, and IP addresses.

Preface
[  ]
Appendix A walks through the steps followed for deploying Community Server to a 
hosted server. Basically it provides a sound process for taking the finished product 
and making it available for public consumption on your host site.
What You Need for This Book 
The prerequisite for this book is a working installation of Community Server. To 
run Community Server the typical environment consists of IIS (5.1 or greater), .NET 
Framework (1.1 or greater), a Database System (����������������������������������
SQL Server 2000, SQL Server 2005, 
or SQL Server 2005 Express Edition�����������������������������������������������
) and a Development Environment (��������������
Visual Studio 
.NET 2003, Visual Studio 2005, or Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition������
). We 
cover the details of prerequisites and installation of Community Server in Chapter 2.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
There are two styles for code. Code words in text are shown as follows: "��������
You can 
also modify the background color of the page header and other adjoining areas by 
supplying the appropriate value for the background-color property��."
A block of code will be set as follows: 
body, html
{
	
margin: 0px;
	
padding: 0px;
	
color: #000000;
	
font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica;
	
background-color: #999966;
}
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the 
relevant lines or items will be made bold:
body, html
{
	
margin: 0px;
	
padding: 0px;
	
color: #000000;

Introducing Community Server
In this chapter, we will provide a brief overview of Community Server and also 
examine the applications included with it. We will further explore the evolution of 
Community Server including a comparison with DotNetNuke (DNN). Towards 
the end of the chapter, we will discuss the various editions and licensing options 
available for Community Server and also provide a sneak preview of some of the key 
features of upcoming Community Server 3.0.
What is Community Server?
Community Server (CS) is a web-based application completely built with Microsoft's 
.NET Framework. It is rendered on the browser as an aspx file. Community Server is 
currently serving millions of websites across the World Wide Web.
aspx is the standard extension for web pages developed 
using ASP.NET.

Introducing Community Server
[  ]
The official website of Community Server is 
http://www.communityserver.org
Community Server provides a facility to create and manage applications such as 
blogs, forums, photo galleries, file galleries, reader, and roller from within a single 
interface. They can be customized as per your requirements. 
Community Server uses a single registration system so you 
only need to register once to work with all applications 
provided by it.
You can choose which application is to be displayed on the home page by clicking 
on the Applications ���������������
link under the Settings section by selecting the Administration 
link on the� Dashboard. For instance, you can enable blogs and forums and disable 
other applications, so that your end users will be able to access only blogs and 
forums from the site. In the same way, you can enable or disable other applications 
depending upon your requirements. Let us examine each one of the applications 
included within Community Server in detail.

Chapter 1
[  ]
Blog
A blog or a weblog is an online diary. It can be maintained either daily, weekly, 
or monthly, as per the convenience of the user who manages it. The first blog was 
started in 1994 and the term weblog was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 
1997. A blog could focus on a particular subject such as technology, politics, local 
and international news, or could just contain random musings. Each post on a blog 
is classified as separate entry, and old blog posts are automatically archived and 
are available for reading at any time as long as the blog is active on the World Wide 
Web. A blog post comprises text, images, links to other blogs or web pages, and 
other media relevant to your blog. Moreover, people use blogs to post articles and 
related news, such as about their vacation trips, awards, and much more. 
Community Server includes an application for the creation and administration of 
blogs as shown in the following screenshot:
We will examine more about the creation and management of blogs in Chapter 3.

Introducing Community Server
[ 10 ]
Forums
A forum is a web-based application used for holding discussions regarding a wide 
range of topics relevant to the site. The evolution of forums dates back to 1995 
when dial-up bulletin boards were popular. Basically, technology, computer games, 
and health are popular areas for forum themes, but there are forums for a huge 
number of different topics such as for discussing the features of specific software, 
programming languages, upcoming events, user-groups discussions, and much 
more. You should note that a forum relates to a specific topic. Forums are also 
commonly referred to as message boards, discussion boards, discussion forums, 
discussion groups, or bulletin boards. ��
Community Server includes an application 
for the creation, management, and administration of forums as shown in screenshot 
below:
We will examine more about the creation and management of forums in Chapter 4.

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
Photo Gallery
A gallery is a term used for storing some kind of information. A photo gallery, as the 
name suggests, stores photos. In olden days, they were stored as hard copy volumes 
spanned into several albums. With the evolution of technology, people started 
storing them on the World Wide Web. �����������������������������������������
Community Server includes an application 
for the creation, management, and administration of a photo gallery as shown in the 
screenshot below:
File Gallery
A file gallery is similar to the photo gallery that we discussed above, with the 
difference that files are stored inside the file gallery instead of images as in the photo 
gallery. With Community Server, you can create a file gallery (see the screenshot 
overleaf) within minutes by following a few simple instructions.

Introducing Community Server
[ 12 ]
We will examine more about the creation and management of galleries in Chapter 5.
Reader and Roller
The functionality of reader and roller has been completely overhauled in Community 
Server 2.1. You will notice significant changes in its working if you currently use any 
of the previous versions of Community Server.
Reader enables you to display the posts from different blogs using Really Simple 
Syndication (RSS) feeds. It shows the posts together with the relevant links in a grid 
as shown in the following screenshot. Each registered member of the site can 
manage his or her own reader provided that the necessary permissions are given by 
the site administrator. 

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
Many people blog everyday with lots of interesting content on a wide range of 
topics. You can easily display all those external posts in your blog using Community 
Server and this functionality is termed roller. Roller makes use of RSS feeds but the 
contents are populated inside the relevant blog to which the feed has been added. 
This feature is popularly called Content Mirroring.
We will examine more about the creation and management of reader and roller 
in Chapter 6.
The Evolution
Microsoft released the first version of an ASP.NET-based forum application 
(see screenshot below) in 2002. The application was initially developed by Scott 
Mitchell under the name WebForums.NET in 2001 and later sold to Microsoft with 
some additional features. It was first deployed at the official website of ASP.NET 
and can be downloaded from http://asp.net/Forums/Download/Default.
aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1.

Introducing Community Server
[ 14 ]
Rob Howard and his team of developers were instrumental in the development 
and management of the application at Microsoft. The forum software is still 
being used by many websites and is available separately for download from the 
above- mentioned Uniform Resource Locator (URL) along with its complete 
source code. 
Rob floated his own company named Telligent Systems in 2004. Telligent decided 
to develop a new forum application with rich features from scratch. This marked 
the beginning of Community Server. The development team decided to extend 
the traditional forum application to include blogs, photos, and galleries, which are 
relevant for developers, business owners, and hobbyists so that they will get all the 
required functionalities under a single umbrella. This will also avoid the pain of 
installing multiple applications for the creation and management of blogs, forums, 
and galleries. 
Telligent initially launched a series of builds and finally ended up with 1.0. After 
getting the feedback from visitors, Telligent launched Community Server 1.1 
including more features. With the release of each version, new features such as an 
improved user interface and the facility to easily customize the software were 

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
included. The launch of Community Server 2.0 has been greatly welcomed among 
developer circles, since it shipped with many more intuitive features than its earlier 
counterparts. One such notable feature is that of roller. With roller, you can display 
posts from the blogs maintained by other people. 
You can either install a fresh copy of Community Server 
or can upgrade from any of the earlier versions by 
following the instructions that are included with the 
installation package.
Telligent has made exciting improvements to version 2.1 of Community Server and 
it includes many powerful features including a new functionality called Tagging as 
shown in the screenshot below:
Moreover, all users can create and manage their own reader and the roller, as 
functionality has been tightly integrated with blogs. 

Introducing Community Server
[ 16 ]
A complete list of all the features can be explored at: 
http://communityserver.org/i/features.aspx
Telligent has made exciting promises for the future builds of the product, which 
include an integrated Content Management System (CMS). We will explore the 
features included with the upcoming Community Server 3.0 at the end of this chapter. 
A Comparison with DotNetNuke (DNN)
DotNetNuke, popularly called DNN is a robust ASP.NET based application used to 
build a complete website. 
The official website of DotNetNuke can be accessed at http://www.dotnetnuke.com.� 
You will find sites powered with DotNetNuke all over the Web. One of the 
unique features of DotNetNuke is that users can build and customize their site 
very easily using administration tools provided by the application. Moreover, 
advanced developers can tweak the source codes and implement their own 
functionalities. One such classic example of advanced customization is DotNetPanel 
(http://www.dotnetpanel.com). It is a powerful hosting control panel for 
managing Windows 2003 Servers. 
DotNetNuke ships with a simple discussion board but it does not contain all the 
features of Community server. It is not possible to create a blog or photo and file 
galleries using DotNetNuke. On the other hand, Community Server is mainly used 
for the creation of blogs, forums, photo and file galleries, reader, and for showcasing 
external blogs using roller. You can make use of both DotNetNuke and Community 
Server to create high quality website by taking advantage of the rich features 
provided by both applications. You can easily deploy them on a single website 
under two different directories since the technology used by both DotNetNuke and 
Community Server is ASP.NET. You only require a server that supports ASP.NET 
and SQL Server 2000 or greater. While DotNetNuke is available free of cost without 
any restrictions, Community Server is available as both free and paid for versions. 
The free version of Community Server is called Express and it has certain restrictions 
for usage. You will learn more about the different editions in the next section of 
this chapter. 
A complete discussion regarding DotNetNuke is beyond the scope of this book. You 
are advised to refer to the books Building Websites with VB.NET and DotNetNuke 3.0 
by Daniel N. Egan (ISBN 1‑904811‑27‑2) and Building Websites with VB.NET and

Editions and Licensing
Community Server is available in five different editions: Express, Standard, 
Professional, Enterprise, and Hosted. Each edition is licensed on a per server basis 
and includes more features than its predecessors. 
The latest version of the licensing guide is available 
for download from the Files section at 
http://communityserver.org/.
It is possible to upgrade to the higher editions as and when necessary by going 
through the Upgrade guide available for download from the official website. A brief 
overview of each edition is given below.
Express
The Express edition is perfect for people who need to get a community up and 
running on a budget. It is free, but has restrictions on use. However, it can be 
deployed for commercial purposes. 
Standard
The Standard edition is the entry-level commercial platform and unlocks some 
features not available in the Express edition.
Professional
The Professional edition is targeted at organizations that require many of the 
capabilities offered by Community Server for running a high-traffic community.
Enterprise
The Enterprise edition unleashes the full potential of Community Server and 
has been designed for organizations that require all of the capabilities found in 
Community Server.

Introducing Community Server
[ 18 ]

What's New in Community Server 3.0 
(or Calypso)?
Telligent has already announced plans for the release of Community Server 3.0. 
The version has been code named as Calypso. It will be mainly targeted towards 
simplifying common tasks with intuitive wizards, improvement of user interfaces, 
and adding more help-oriented content. Moreover, Community Server 3.0 will only 
run on ASP.NET 2.0, unlike Community Server 2.0 which ran on both ASP.NET 1.1 
and 2.0.
The key features that are proposed to be included with Community Server 3.0 are 
listed overleaf. 

Introducing Community Server
[ 20 ]
Chameleon
This is a theme engine that will deliver a simpler way to create themes. It will also 
include features that will enable users to manage the look/feel of a theme via the 
Control Panel. The goals are to reduce the number of files involved in skinning a 
blog and to provide a streamlined non-technical set of tools for easily creating 
user interfaces.
Morpheus
This is a membership update tool, which will be integrated with the ASP.NET 2.0 
membership store. This will allow easier integration with existing user bases and 
external storage of membership data.
Zion
This is a new centralized file storage system, which will provide more consistent and 
extensible support for files and attachments in Community Server. In addition, the 
update to blogs will allow for better image/file support on a per-post basis.
Tallyman
It is the next version of the mail gateway, which will enable anyone, anywhere, 
including shared hosting and smaller sites, to leverage integrated email and mail list 
functionality within Community Server.
Telligent is planning to add one more module to Community Server 3.0, which is 
code-named Mystique. In addition to the above set of new features, Community 
Server 3.0 also includes an integrated CMS, which will provide knowledge 
management, content management, and case management functionalities. At the time 
of writing this book, Calypso is slated for release during the first quarter of 2007. 
Summary
In this chapter, we have seen a brief overview of Community Server and the 
applications in it. We also explored the evolution of Community Server, a brief 
comparison with DotNetNuke, and the various editions of the product and features 
included with each one of them including pricing information. We also examined the 
new features included with the upcoming Community Server 3.0. 
The next chapter will provide a comprehensive coverage of the various steps 
involved with the installation of Community Server. 

Getting Started with 
Community Server
Before beginning to work with Community Server, we need to complete certain 
initial steps such as installation and configuration of the databases. This chapter 
demonstrates all the required steps involved with setting up Community Server 
using Windows and Web-based installation file formats. Towards the end of this 
chapter, we will demonstrate how to test the installation, and also explore the 
options included inside the Control Panel Dashboard of Community Server.
Prerequisites
In order to install and run Community Server, you require access to a set of software 
as listed below:
System/��������
/��������
Software
Requirements
Production
Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2000 
Development
Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2
Internet Information Services (IIS)
IIS 5.1 or greater
.NET Framework
1.1 or greater
Database
SQL Server 2000, SQL Server 2005, or SQL Server 2005 
Express Edition
Development Environment
Visual Studio .NET 2003, Visual Studio 2005, or 
Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 22 ]
Any one of the development environments listed above will be required for 
customization of the source code using Community Server Software Development 
Kit (SDK).
This chapter assumes that you have installed .NET 
Framework 1.1 and Community Server 2.1. However, 
Community Server 3.0, which is the next release, only 
supports .NET Framework 2.0 or greater. 
Downloading Community Server
The first step that you need to follow is to properly obtain the required software 
from the official website, http://www.communityserver.org. From the home 
page, locate the Downloads link to find a list of all the latest installations and other 
companion files, including Community Server Software Development Kit (SDK) 
as noted earlier. As stated in the previous chapter, you can download the Express 
Edition, which is available free of cost.
Before initiating a download, you must register on the site. For this purpose, 
navigate to the above-mentioned site, and click on the link titled Join, ���������������
located on the 
extreme top of the right-hand side of the page as shown below:
You need to enter the requested details such as Sign in Name, Password, and Email 
Address. For the purpose of our discussion, we will give the sign-in name as csbook. 
You should enter the password and email address twice and also pick up your 
preferred Timezone. After entering all the required information, click the Join Now 
button to proceed further with the registration process. The button will be enabled 
only if you enter all the required information on the page. If the registration is 
successful, you will view a page as shown in the following screenshot and you will 
be signed in automatically.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
You can browse the Downloads page without registration, 
but you will be able to download the files only if you 
register and sign in to the site.
The top right side portion of the page will now read as Signed in as << User_Name >> 
as shown in the following screenshot: 
Install Options
Before downloading the required file for installation, you should locate it properly. 
For this purpose, click the Downloads link from the top navigation bar. Initially, you 
will be presented with a page that displays a list of all the popular downloads. In 
order to view the installation files for Community Server 2.1, you need to expand the 
tree labeled Current Releases and select the option titled Community Server. 
Community Server is available in two different install options—Windows Installer 
(MSI Format) and Web Installer (ZIP Format). Let us examine the download process 
involved with each of these file formats in detail.
Using Windows Installer to Download 
Community Server
On clicking the link titled Community Server 2.1 (MSI) - ASP.NET 1.1 from 
the Downloads page as described earlier, a screen as shown in the screenshot below 
is displayed:

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 24 ]
If you wish to download the installation file for ASP.NET 
2.0, then you should click the link titled Community Server 
2.1 (MSI) - ASP.NET 2.0.
The download process will be started as soon as you click the Download button, and 
will be completed within few minutes depending upon the speed of your Internet 
connectivity. You should then execute the file in order to install Community Server. 
It is not possible to use the installer if you want to upgrade the existing version 
of Community Server to a new version or to set it up in a shared web hosting 
environment. It is only oriented for fresh installation of Community Server either in 
a local system or in an intranet environment.
Using Web Installer to Download Community 
Server
The web-based installation package is ideal for setting up Community Server either 
in a local system or in a remote web server. In order to download the installation 
file, navigate to the Downloads page as explained earlier and click the link titled 
Community Server 2.1 (Web Install) - ASP.NET 1.1. A similar screen to that shown 
on the previous page will be displayed.
If you wish to download the installation file for ASP.NET 
2.0, then you should click the link titled Community Server 
2.0 (Web Install) - ASP.NET 2.0.
We will examine the process involved with the installation of Community Server 
using the two different formats discussed above in the forthcoming sections of 
this chapter.
Installing Community Server
We have now downloaded the required files for installation of Community Server. 
The next step is to properly run the setup to complete its installation. We will 
examine the installation process involved with both file formats as mentioned above, 
in detail.

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
Installing Community Server Using the 
Windows Installer
Since the Windows Installer file format comes in a zipped format, you need to extract 
the content of it to a location, preferably in a new folder on your hard drive. Once the 
file has been unzipped, a new file with the name communityserver_2_1_aspnet11 
will be added to the folder in which you extracted the ZIP file. The installation 
file is a Microsoft Windows Installer Package and hence you can directly start the 
installation process by double-clicking on it. 
In order to extract the contents of a ZIP file, you can 
either use the built-in compression utility available with 
the Windows Operating System or one of the third-party 
software such as WinZip (http://www.winzip.com) or 
JustZIPit (http://www.download.com/JustZipIt/
3000-2250-10222610.html).
You will then be presented with a series of wizards. You have to follow the 
instructions specified on the screen to properly install the application. You will be 
required to accept a license agreement and should also specify a location on your 
hard drive where the application will be installed. You can also choose the default 
location. Finally, the installation will be started and the wizard will display the 
installation progress.
Configuring Community Server
Once the installation has been successfully completed, the wizard will automatically 
prompt you to configure Community Server. You need to again go through a series 
of steps to complete the configuration. The wizard will prompt you to specify the 
location of the virtual directory, database credentials, and administrator's login 
information. You can give any meaningful name in Install to the virtual folder 
field on the Web Server Setup screen but the name should not clash with any of the 
previous installations. After gathering the requested information, the wizard will 
automatically execute database scripts, which include Tables and Stored Procedures 
and will prepare the application ready for launch.
A Virtual Directory is a folder on your hard drive mapped 
to the Internet Information Services (IIS) on your system.

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 26 ]
Connecting to the Database
During the configuration process, you will be asked to specify the required 
credentials to connect to the SQL Server database as shown in the following 
screenshot. Firstly, you need to specify the server name or IP address. By default, the 
server name is (local). You should substitute the Server Name field with the correct 
value if you are using Microsoft SQL Server 2005. 
You can retrieve the server name of your SQL Server 2005 
installation from the SQL Server Management Studio (Start 
| All Programs | Microsoft SQL Server 2005 | SQL Server 
Management Studio) login screen. 
Instead of creating a new database using SQL Server, you can directly specify the 
database name along with the required Username and Password. The wizard will 
automatically create the specified database and Community Server will be installed 
under that database.

Chapter 2
[ 27 ]
From the screenshot opposite, you should note that the Username for setting up 
the SQL Server database is sa, which stands for System Administrator. The sa, 
or equivalent account, should only be used for setting up the database, not as the 
login with which Community Server communicates with the database. In the next 
screen, you will be required to choose either Windows Authentication or SQL 
Authentication. For the purpose of our discussion, you should select the option 
titled Use SQL Authentication and supply the same username and password as you 
gave in the above step.
Windows Authentication vs. SQL Server 
Authentication 
Windows integrated authentication is the preferred method for running Community 
Server. You should configure a single Windows user account for your Community 
Server system that Community Server can use to communicate with the database. 
Ideally, this is the same account that IIS uses to run the Community Server 
application; by default this will be either: ASPNET (Windows 2000 Server) or the 
Network Service group (Windows Server 2003). SQL Server authentication is used 
when Windows authentication is not available.
Configuring the Administrator Account
Once the required database has been successfully created, Community Server 
will automatically prompt you to specify certain information such as username, 
password, and email address as shown in the following screenshot overleaf. You will 
later on use these credentials to log in to the site as an administrator.

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 28 ]
Make sure to specify a password that satisfies the condition 
listed above in red color. The wizard will not proceed 
further until you specify a password in the
correct format.
After the completion of the configuration, the wizard automatically prompts you to 
launch the site as shown in the following screenshot.

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
You can view the installation log by selecting the link View Installation Log. The 
log file specifies the start and end time of various actions performed by the Windows 
Installer during the installation process. 
Launching Community Server
Community Server will automatically launch in your default browser as seen in the 
following screenshot, if you had checked the Launch Community Server option 
during the installation process. 

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 30 ]
The whole installation process has been completely managed by a series of wizards, 
and there is no need for any manual intervention, even for creation of the database. 
As noted earlier in the chapter, the above installation process is oriented only for 
setting up Community Server either locally or in an intranet environment. 
On a remote web server, you have to manually install Community Server using the 
web-based installer, which is available in ZIP format. You can also use the installer for 
local installation but you should follow certain steps as explained in the next section. 
Installing Community Server Using the 
Web Installer
Firstly, you have to download the installation file and extract the contents to the 
root directory (Inetpub/wwwroot), as explained previously. In case you plan to 
install Community Server on a remote web server then you will be required to 
upload the folders and files inside the Web folder to the wwwroot directory of the 
appropriate domain. In some servers, you will be required to upload the files inside 
httpdocs folder.

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
Refer to Appendix A for more information regarding 
how to properly deploy Community Server in different 
environments. 
As we discussed earlier, there are separate builds available for ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0 
for version 2.1 of Community Server. We will make use of the installation package 
meant for ASP.NET 1.1 to demonstrate the installation process in this section. Locate 
the downloaded file on your hard drive after downloading it and extract the contents 
of the folder.
The extracted folder contains two folders named SqlScripts and Web, some license 
agreement files (EULA), and a readme file. The SQLScripts folder contains a number 
of SQL script files that are mainly used for upgrading from a previous version of 
Community Server to the current version, and not for a fresh installation.
The folder named Web contains lots of files and folders, which are required for 
successfully running Community Server. You need to copy the contents of this 
folder either inside the root directory of your local system (Inetpub/wwwroot), or 
upload inside the root directory (wwwroot or httpdocs) on a remote web server. For 
the purpose of our discussion, we will examine the installation process as if you are 
performing it in a local system.
Creating a Database Using SQL Server
The next step in the installation process is to create a SQL Server database using SQL 
Server. You can use either SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005 to create a database. 
For the purpose of our discussion, we will create a database using SQL Server 2005. 
It includes a robust interface for the creation and management of databases named 
SQL Server Management Studio. You can launch it from Start | All Programs | 
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and log in by supplying the correct Server name, Login, 
and Password.
You should use the credentials of the default administrator 
account, which you gave at the time of SQL Server 2005 
installation, for the purpose of database creation.
Once you log in to the management studio, pull down the Databases tree from the 
left side and right-click on it. Select the menu item named New Database as shown 
in the following screenshot:

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 32 ]
To create a database using SQL Server 2000, log in to 
the Query Analyzer as an administrator and supply the 
following command: 
 create database Your_Database_Name
Alternatively, you can also use Enterprise Manager to 
create the required database.
The New Database dialog box pops up. Enter the required database name and 
click the OK button. We will use CommunityServer as a name for our database. 
SQL Server 2005 will show the progress while the database is being created and 
will display the same under the Databases tree. You can now disconnect from the 
management studio by selecting File | Disconnect Object Explorer menu option.
SQL Server 2005 Express Edition is available as an 
alternative to the full blown developer edition of SQL 
Server 2005. Even though it is free of cost, the main 
disadvantage of express edition is that the size of each 
database is restricted to 4 GB. In order to use it, you should 
download and install Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express 
Edition (53.8 MB) and SQL Server Management Studio 
Express (38.5 MB) from http://msdn.microsoft.
com/vstudio/express/sql/download/. Once you 
have installed both of them, you can log in to SQL Server 
Management Studio Express by supplying the credentials 
that you gave at the time of installation of Microsoft SQL 
Server 2005 Express Edition. The look and feel of the studio 
interface looks similar to that of developer edition and 
the process of database creation is also the same as 
explained above.

Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
We have now successfully created a database required for the installation of 
Community Server. The next step is to launch the web-based installation wizard to 
install the application.
Community Server ships with a built-in web-based installer along with the web 
installer package in ZIP format. It will automatically create the required tables and 
stored procedures for the successful installation of the application.
Using the Installation Wizard
By default, the Installation Wizard is disabled and you should enable it before 
attempting to install Community Server. To enable the installer, you need to navigate 
to the folder Installer inside the Web directory and open the default.aspx file. You 
can open the file using any editor of your choice such as Notepad, Visual Studio 
2005, or Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition.
In the default.aspx file, locate the statement 
bool INSTALLER_ENABLED = false;
You should modify the value of the above statement to true to enable the installer. 
You are now ready to launch the web-based installer to install Community Server.
For the purpose of our discussion, we have modified the name of the folder Web to 
cs21. Hence, we need to enter http://localhost/cs21/Installer/default.aspx 
on the browser to launch the installation wizard. Now, you will have to fix an 
error message (see the following screenshot) before proceeding further with the 
installation process.

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 34 ]
This error can be easily resolved by navigating to the folder cs21 using Internet 
Information Services (IIS) and making it as an application. 
Launch Internet Information Services (IIS) by navigating to Start | Control Panel | 
Administrative Tools. Double-click the icon labeled Internet Information Services 
and pull down the server name from the left side panel. Expand the tree labeled 
Web Sites | Default Web Site and locate the folder cs21. Right-click on it and select 
Properties. The following dialog box is displayed:
Click the Create button to transform the folder cs21 to an application. The 
Application name field will now display our folder name. 

Chapter 2
[ 35 ]
You will not have to perform this task if you host 
Community Server on a remote web server since the 
root virtual directory will be automatically enabled as an 
application at the time of creation of the site. 
We are now ready to launch the installer by navigating to 
http://localhost/cs21/installer/default.aspx. You will be required to 
walk through a series of wizards to proceed with the Community Server installation. 
You need to click the Next button on each screen to proceed further with the 
installation process. 
If you have installed .NET Framework 1.1 and 2.0 and 
version 2.0 is your default framework then the system will 
throw a The resource cannot be found error message. 
In order to resolve this error, click the button captioned 
Configuration from the IIS Properties dialog and double 
click the extension .aspx. The Add/Edit Application 
Extension Mapping dialog pops up. In the Executable 
field, modify the .NET Framework version number from 
2.0.50727 to 1.1.4322.
During the course of installation, you will be asked to supply the required 
credentials for connecting to the SQL Server database as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 36 ]
You need to enter either the actual server name of your local SQL Server installation 
or the IP address that needs to be connected to if you are running the installer on a 
remote server. The IP address should be that of your remote SQL Server installation, 
and not that of the web server. Nowadays, the majority of hosts separate web and 
database servers to increase the performance of websites. You will need to contact 
your service provider if you are not sure as to what to give as the server name. We 
have already discussed Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication. If 
you use SQL Server Authentication then you should supply the required username 
and password. 
If the entered credentials are correct then the installation wizard will automatically 
populate the SQL Server 2005 databases available on the system. For the purpose of 
our discussion, we earlier created a database named CommunityServer. If you are 
running the installation on a remote web server, then the wizard will display the list 
of all databases available on the remote database server. Click on the Next button to 
continue with the installation process after selecting the appropriate database from 
the list.
The wizard automatically prompts you to choose the installation options as shown 
in the following screenshot. It is recommended you checkmark all the options for the 
sake of simplicity.
After investigating the above options, click Next button to proceed further. The wizard 
will prompt you to enter the requested information for the creation of an administrator 
account such as Username, Password, and an Email address as shown in the next 

Chapter 2
[ 37 ]
screenshot. You will need to log in using these credentials after successful installation 
to manage Community Server. It is highly advisable to checkmark the entry titled 
Create Sample Data so that the wizard will automatically create a sample blog and 
a photo gallery. You can simply leave the Community Url field as it is without any 
modifications. Community Server automatically populates this field with the required 
web address as shown in the following screenshot:
The installer will automatically create tables, stored procedures, and the required 
sample data as soon as you click the Next button from the screen in the above 
screenshot. This process may take some time to complete, and a page with the 
required link for navigating to the home page will be displayed after the completion 
of the installation process.
The remote web server sometimes displays a timeout error when you perform the 
above installation step. In such a case, you should attempt to perform the installation 
at a time when the server traffic is not at its peak. You must either delete the current 
database and create a new one when you install again or just create a new one at the 
time when you again perform the installation process. Otherwise, the installation 
will not be successful.
You have now successfully completed the installation of Community Server.

Getting Started with Community Server
[ 38 ]
If you used the Web Installer for performing the installation 
process, it is highly recommended that you remove the folder 
Installer. Alternatively, you can disable the installation 
wizard by undoing the changes we made to the default.aspx 
file earlier. This will enable you to again run the installation 
wizard if required at a later point of time.
Testing the Installation of Community Server
Since we have successfully completed the installation process, let us now look 
at how to test and view the final output. For this purpose, navigate to 
http://localhost/cs21 using your browser. 
You may receive a Directory Access Denied error message when you attempt to 
access the site using the above-mentioned address. To fix this error first navigate 
to Start | Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Internet Information Services. 
Then locate the folder cs21, right-click, select Properties, and then choose the 
Documents tab as shown in the screenshot below:

Chapter 2
[ 39 ]
Initially, default.aspx is not added as a default document inside the default 
documents list box. You can add it by selecting the Add button and entering 
the required file name as shown in the screenshot opposite. You will not get the 
above-mentioned error message when you install Community Server using 
Windows Installer. This is because the installer automatically configures the 
relevant Virtual Directory during the installation process.
We have already seen the final output earlier (see the screenshot that is a 'Welcome' 
page, in the section Launching Community Server) when we discussed the installation 
of Community Server using Windows Installer file package. At the top of the home 
page, you will see five links as shown below:
You should note that a sample Blog and a Photo gallery have been automatically 
created by the installer. You can set up remaining applications such as forums or 
photo and file galleries using the administration control panel. We will examine the 
creation and management of all applications included within Community Server in 
the following chapters.
Navigating the Control Panel Dashboard
The Control Panel is the main brain behind the working of Community Server. In 
order to work with the Control Panel, you need to log in as an administrator. This 
can be done by clicking on the Sign in link located on the top of the page and by 
entering your administrator username and password, which you gave at the time 
of installation.
As soon as you log in, you will be able to view a new link titled Control Panel as 
shown in the screenshot below:
If you click the Control Panel link, you will see lot of settings for managing all 
the applications included with Community Server. These settings are displayed 
in a page titled Dashboard, which displays all the required functionalities for 
managing the site. The following table shows a list of all the options included on the 
Dashboard along with its purpose:

On the right side of the Dashboard, you will find announcements, which are updated 
regularly by Telligent, and also the version number of Community Server. You can 
return to the home page at any time by clicking on the link labeled Exit Control 
Panel and Return to Site located on the top portion of the control panel dashboard 
as shown in the screenshot below:

[ 41 ]
Summary
In this chapter, we looked at the installation of Community Server using both the 
Windows Installer (MSI) and Web Installer (ZIP) packages. We also saw how to 
load Community Server after its successful installation and also briefly explored the 
options found inside the control panel dashboard. 
From the next chapter onwards, we will start exploring each one of the applications 
included with Community Server starting from the creation and management 
of blogs.


Working with Blogs
In the previous chapters, we examined the evolution of Community Server and its 
installation procedure, and also gave a brief outline of the various elements included 
within the Dashboard. From this chapter onwards, we will begin our adventure with 
the various applications included with Community Server. In this chapter, we will 
discuss the creation and management of blogs with the help of a sample blog. 
Understanding Blogs
A blog is a simple tool for people to quickly and easily publish content. Posts to a 
blog can span any topic from reviews, vacation news, family events and happenings 
to work‑related issues, etc. They can be about any issue that relates to the daily 
activities of a person, group, or organization. Also, other readers can post their 
opinions or feedback as comments on these blog entries. In short, a blog is a place to 
conveniently share ideas and publish thoughts. Community Server archives posts 
automatically on a monthly basis.
There are a number of websites that provide a facility to easily create and set up a 
blog such as Blogger (http://www.blogger.com) from Google. From such websites, 
you can create your own blog instantly. Many companies have also developed 
blog-related applications where the users can plug in to their own web space. This 
gives more flexibility to users as they can manage their blog themselves instead of 
accessing it by using another URL. Community Server ships with a powerful blog 
application with which users can create and manage blogs for themselves or for their 
friends, customers, and employees. We will thoroughly examine all the aspects of 
building a blog using Community Server in this chapter. 
We will analyze the concepts surrounding Community Server blogs with the help 
of a sample blog titled csbook. We will then explore how to manage the blog, post 
content, and format blog posts, along with other related topics.

Working with Blogs
[ 44 ]
Blog Groups
Before we create a blog, we need to create a blog group. Blog groups are a way of 
organizing blogs within the site. For our understanding, we'll create a new blog 
group csbookblog for our blog.
Creating a Blog Group
In order to create a blog group, click on the link titled Blog Groups located under 
the Blogs navigation panel by selecting the Administration link on the Dashboard. 
You will view a new page as shown in the following screenshot. From the following 
screenshot, you will see that a sample blog group with the name Sample Weblogs 
has been automatically created by the installer.
Now, click the Add New Group button. A small window with the title New Group 
will pop up. Enter the required information in it as shown in the screenshot below 
and submit the page by clicking on the Save button.
You will be returned to the Site Administration page and the newly created blog 
group will appear below the default group as shown in the next screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
Managing Blog Groups
You can edit or delete a blog group at any time. Editing a blog group is very similar 
to creating a new group but deleting it is a little different. Community Server will 
prompt you to confirm the action by showing a message box that lets you cancel the 
operation if you had clicked the button by mistake.
In the same manner, you can create a number of blog groups as per your 
requirements. For instance, you can create separate groups for each programming 
language so that you can file each blog under the respective group. This will help 
you to manage the blog easily at a later point of time. Community Server is designed 
to support thousands of blogs on a single installation, so while the necessity of a blog 
group isn't immediately apparent, if you run a larger site, it will be invaluable.
By default, the Site Administration page is displayed in grid view. You can change 
the look to tree view by clicking on the button captioned Change to Tree View. The 
big advantage of using the tree view interface is that you can perform various tasks 
very much more easily than from the default grid view interface.

Working with Blogs
[ 46 ]
Adding a new group is very easy with the tree view interface. The relevant fields will 
be displayed on the Blogs and Details sections as soon as you click on the Add New 
Group button. You can easily edit a group by simply clicking on the relevant tree 
node. You can also right click on the tree to create and manage a blog group. Let us 
now look into how to create a new blog. 
Creating a Blog
Now we can create the csbook sample blog. For this purpose, we have to log on 
to our Community Server site as an administrator and use the options inside the 
Dashboard to create the blog.
Once you are logged in as the site administrator click on the link labelled Control 
Panel from the top navigation bar. Inside the Dashboard, you will see a series of 
entries as shown in the screenshot below:
Click on the link titled Add new blogs, control permissions, etc to begin. You 
will now view a lot of settings on the left-side navigation panel as shown in the 
screenshot below. As an administrator, you will use these settings to create and 
manage blogs.

Chapter 3
[ 47 ]
You can also access Blog Settings by clicking the 
Administration link from the Dashboard.
In order to follow the steps explained below, you should change the interface to grid 
view format by clicking on the Change to Grid View button located on the bottom 
right-hand side of the page. Click on the link titled Create New Blog located under 
the Blogs section on the navigation panel to create a new blog. You will view a page 
as shown below:
You will have to enter the required information to create a new blog using the 
various options on the Settings tab. You can also specify permissions for the new 
blog using the Permissions tab. If you point the mouse cursor over the question 
mark symbol, a screen tip will be displayed and this will help you to learn more 
about that specific setting.
Let us now examine each one of the options included on the Settings tab in detail:
Name: You need to give a name for your blog. It should be preferably a name that 
corresponds to the context of your site. For instance, if your site is related to ASP.
NET, then you can supply a name such as aspnetblog. For our sample blog, we will 
give csbook as the name.
URL: You should specify a unique value, which will be used to identify your blog. 
The relevant blog will be created inside the blog's subdirectory located inside 
your Community Server installation folder. For example, if your Community 
Server website is http://mygreatsite.com, your URL would be 
http://mygreatsite.com/blogs/[URL].

Working with Blogs
[ 48 ]
For our sample blog, we will give a value csbook in the field. Hence, in order to 
navigate to the blog, we should navigate to http://localhost/cs21/blogs/csbook 
to view the home page of our blog after its creation.
Owner: In this field, you can include the username of a member who will manage 
the blog. The specified member will ultimately become the owner of the blog. For our 
sample blog, we will specify a member with the username anandn_mvp as the owner. 
Hence, this member can manage our sample blog titled csbook. 
Administrators can manage all blogs on the site. 
You should note that when you deploy Community Server on a production server, 
you will have to specify the actual username of a user registered on the site. As an 
administrator, you should either contact the member for the actual username or can 
also create a new account for a member directly by clicking the Create New Account 
link located under the Membership section inside the Dashboard. As soon as the 
specified user logs in they will have access to the Dashboard from where they can 
post content and manage their blog. 
Blog Group: You should select the specific blog group from the drop-down list. We 
have already created a new blog group with the name csbookblog and we will use 
this group to create our sample blog.
Enable Blog: You can enable or disable the blog using this setting. By default, this 
field is enabled. If you disable it then you will not be able to manage the blog until 
you enable the blog again. This setting will be useful when you need to do any 
maintenance on your blog.
Enable AggBugs: If you enable this option, then an invisible tracking image will be 
inserted into each of the syndicated post. This setting is useful for RSS readers that 
display your post and allows Community Server to maintain statistics on how often 
RSS readers read your content (although the accuracy of these statistics is usually 
under reported).
Index Posts: This setting will enable the blog posts to be included in search results. 
The relevant posts will be visible as soon as you perform a search on the Community 
Server site. However, the blog posts will not be included in the RSS feed. 
Include in community aggregate: When this option is enabled, all posts are included 
in the blog home page and also in the RSS feed.

Chapter 3
[ 49 ]
Default Language: Community Server provides the ability to select a language for your 
blog. The default language is English but you can select another language if you prefer. 
Managing Permissions
Community Server supports a robust permission system that allows the site 
administrator to delegate permissions to other users. The permission system uses 
role-based authentication; thus users are assigned to roles and roles are then granted 
permissions to perform tasks.
You can give access to the blog to various users registered on the site using the 
settings on the tab named Permissions. All you need to do is to appropriately 
select the specific permission for a specific group of users as shown in the 
following screenshot:
For instance, you can give the permission to upload files to a moderator by 
navigating to the Moderator row and clicking on the checkbox in the Upload 
Attachment column. 
You need not go back to the Settings tab again after specifying permissions. You 
can directly click on the Save button located at the bottom of the page to create a 

Working with Blogs
[ 50 ]
new blog. As soon as you click on the button, the relevant blog will be created and 
displayed inside the grid as shown in the following screenshot:
As you can see from the above screenshot, the grid shows the owner(s) (in the 
column Author(s)) of that blog and also the relevant group to which it has been 
associated. The blog has also been enabled and is ready for use. You can also edit, 
manage, or delete the blogs at any time by clicking on the relevant button from the 
specified row on the grid.  
You can globally specify the required permissions for 
all the active blogs created on the site using the Global 
Permissions link from the Blogs section located inside the 
Site Administration page. To access the Site Administration 
page, click the Control Panel link and then select the 
Administration link.
Managing a Blog
The blog owner or users identified as blog owners through permissions now have 
the ability to manage the blog. 
An administrator should specify the permissions for the 
members registered on the site to access a specific blog 
during the creation of the blog as discussed in the section 
Creating a Blog.
You can manage a blog created on the site by either clicking on the Manage button 
from the grid on the blogs page or by selecting the My Blogs link in the Control 
Panel main navigation user interface. The Blog Management page appears with a 
new navigation panel and other related information as shown in the next screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
The entry Current Blog indicates the URL of the active blog. The link title reads 
csbook and it indicates that it is our sample blog. For our sample blog, URL will be 
http://localhost/cs21/blogs/csbook/default.aspx. ����
The My Blog Dashboard 
section provides information about the owner, creation date of the blog, and total 
number of posts and pages. It also includes feedback-related details such as total 
number of comments posted on the blog and how many are pending for approval by 
the administrator including the Total Trackbacks and Pingbacks.
Trackback is a method by which two blogs communicate 
with each other. Community Server provides built-in 
support for trackbacks. For example, if you publish content 
on your blog and if there is similar content at another blog 
then you can notify the owner of that other blog with a 
trackback ping. The notification will be communicated 
to the owner of another blog in the form of entries. The 
trackback value will be updated as other blog owners post 
content similar to the content that you have posted. The real 
usage of this feature will be visible only if you run a blog 
hosted on a live web server. 
Pingback is similar to trackback. With the help of pingbacks, 
you can request notification when somebody links to one 
of your documents, articles, or posts. This enables you to 
keep track of who is linking to, or referring to your articles 
or posts. Community Server supports automatic pingbacks 
where all the links in a published article can be pinged when 
the article is published.

Working with Blogs
[ 52 ]
The Select Blog to Manage button enables you to switch to a blog, if you wish to 
manage another blog on the site. However, you will only be able to manage only 
those blogs for which you have permissions.
As you can see from the screenshot on the previous page, the navigation bar on the 
left side includes various options for managing a blog. Let us now examine each one 
of them in detail.
Writing your Blog Entry
In order to author a blog post, you should click the link titled Write a Blog Post from 
the Common Tasks panel on the Blog Management page. ���������������������������
Initially, you will view a 
text editor as shown in the next screenshot: 
If you select the Advanced Options check box from the above displayed interface, you 
will be able to see a text editor with a new set of tabs as shown in the screenshot below:

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
You can post a simple blog by entering the required information in the Title, Body, 
and Tags fields. If you file a blog entry under a specified tag, then it will enable you 
to browse the relevant post easily by simply clicking on the specific tag. You can 
also enhance your content by using the various formatting options available on the 
text editor. 
By default, you see a standard text editor without any major 
features. You can modify the interface to an enhanced editor 
by selecting your username from the top of the page and 
selecting the required value from the Content Editor 
dropdown located under the Site Options tab.
For our sample blog, we will post a simple post with the following information:
Title

The Post Attachments tab enables you to add files to your blog entry. Files added 
through this tab will also be published as an attachment in the RSS feed for your 
blog. For example, to create a podcast you could simply attach an audio file here. 
You will view two buttons captioned Add/Update and Remove upon clicking the 
tab. On clicking the Add/Update button, a new dialog with the title Attach File pops 
up as shown in the following screenshot. You can either attach a file from your local 
system or give a link to a resource on the Web. For our sample blog, we will attach a 
file located on the local system.

Working with Blogs
[ 54 ]
Since we have uploaded an image from the system, we need to select the first option, 
browse for the file and click on the Save button to finish the process. 
You can upload videos to your blog, such as a demonstration of your site or a 
tutorial demo regarding ASP.NET 2.0 or anything that you have created, using the 
options available on the Video tab.
You can also click the Create a New Page link located under 
the Common Tasks panel on the Blog Management page to 
write a new blog entry. 
You can post a short excerpt or an abstract about your blog using the Options tab. 
If you wish to give a unique name for your blog entry then you can make use of 
the Name field. You can also specify the date and time on which the blog has to be 
posted on the site from the Options tab. 
The Advanced Options tab enables you to manage some of the other activities 
related to your blog as described in the list given below:
Allow Replies/Comments: If this is disabled, your readers can't post comments to 
your blog entry.
Comment Moderation: You can specify whether to moderate comments or not. By 
default, all comments are published immediately after posting.
Email Feedback Notifications: When this is enabled, owners will receive email 
notifications when new comments are made to their blog. By default, notifications 
are disabled.
Enable Trackbacks: When this is enabled, the blog will record trackbacks 
and pingbacks.
Enable Ratings: Users can rate a post on the scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest 
rating. By default, rating is enabled for each post.
Publish to my aggregate list: If this is enabled, your post will appear on the list of 
posts on the home page. 
Publish to site's aggregate list: If this is enabled, your post will be included in the 
list of posts for you blog.
Syndicate Excerpt: If this is enabled, your excerpt will be published in the RSS feed 
for your blog.

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
The Preview tab will help you to view the post before it is published on the site. For 
our sample blog the preview will look as shown in the following screenshot:
After previewing the blog entry, you should post it to the system. Community Server 
provides three different options for posting a blog entry as you can see from the 
above screenshot. 
The Save and Continue Writing button not only saves the active blog entry but also 
enables you to continue composing it without any interruption. This option 
is beneficial for long blog entries where you could save the post very often to avoid 
loss of data. 
The Save, but don't Publish button enables you to save the blog entry. An important 
point to note is that the blog entry will not be published publicly on the site if you 
choose this button. The relevant entry will not be visible outside the Control Panel. 
This option is beneficial if you wish to publish the post after updating the blog post 
at a later time. 
The Publish button saves and publishes the blog entry publicly on the site. You can 
choose this option if you have finished the writing process completely. 
As soon as you click on the Publish button, the relevant blog entry will be visible 
inside the grid on the Blog Posts page. The grid displays a list of all the published 
blog posts as shown in the screenshot below. For our sample blog, we have 
published only one post and hence the grid displays a single post.

Working with Blogs
[ 56 ]
Viewing a Blog Post
You can view the blog entry by clicking the View button from the relevant row on 
the grid. Alternatively, you can click on the Current Blog link on the top of the page 
to navigate directly to your blog. For our sample blog, the final output as it appears 
on the home page will look like this:
We will explore more about the various items on the home page of the blog in detail 
later on in this chapter.
Working with Comments
In the previous section, we saw how to post and view a blog entry. In this section, 
we will examine how to work with comments that other users post to your blog. But 
before proceeding further, let us see how to post a comment. Navigate to the home 
page of the blog as explained in the previous section and click on the link titled 
0 Comments[Edit] on the bottom of the post as displayed in the above screenshot. 
Enter the required information as shown in the screenshot below and click on the 
Submit button.
The URL field allows you to display your web address on the site and it is optional. 
You should however compulsorily enter your feedback about the relevant blog post 
on the Comments field if you wish to post a comment

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
As soon as you click the Submit button, Community Server displays a message like: 
Thanks for sharing your feedback! If your feedback doesn't appear right away, 
please be patient as it may take a few minutes to publish - or longer if the blogger 
is moderating comments. 
The above message signifies that your comment has been successfully posted on the 
relevant blog. If the blog has been enabled to immediately publish comments, which 
our sample blog has, you will be able to view the comment if you browse to the 
relevant blog post. Let us now examine how to view the posted comment. 
Viewing Comments
Comments can be viewed only along with the relevant blog post. There are 
different ways to view them. If you are inside the Dashboard and logged in as an 
administrator then you need to click the My Blogs link from the top navigation 
bar. From the My Blog Dashboard page, navigate to the link titled Current Blog. 
You will be able to view the comment if you click the link that is highlighted in the 
following screenshot:
If you are outside the Dashboard but logged in as an administrator or user then you 
can directly navigate to the home page of the site and click on the link titled Blogs 
from the top navigation bar. By default, the home page displays a list of all the posts 
available on the blog as shown in the screenshot overleaf:

Working with Blogs
[ 58 ]
As you can see from the screenshot above, one comment has been posted along with 
the total number of hits (four in our case). The other blog entry has been created by 
the installer at the time of installation of Community Server. 
Clicking on the heading will take you to the relevant blog page. You should note 
that for each post there is a separate URL, which you can see in the address bar of 
your browser. For our sample blog post, it will look like http://localhost/cs21/
blogs/csbook/archive/2006/09/03/Community-Server-_2D00_-A-User-Guide.
aspx and this comment can be viewed by navigating to the URL as follows:

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
As you can see from the above screenshot, the comment is displayed along with the 
exact date and time at which it was posted. 
Generating Email Alerts
In order to receive an email alert whenever any new comments are posted to the 
blog post, you should click the link titled Send me email alerts for new comments 
to this post on the Blog page. As soon as you click on it, the link title changes to Stop 
sending me email alerts for this post. You should click on this link to stop receiving 
alerts from the site. 
Managing Comments
Let us now examine how to manage comments. Firstly, click on the link My Blogs 
from the Dashboard to open the Blog Management page. Select the Review 
Comments link from the left side navigation bar and the following page will 
be displayed:

Working with Blogs
[ 60 ]
The View button will enable you to preview both the post and the comment. You 
can also delete the comment from the post by using the Delete button. By default, 
the page will show the comments posted on all the blog posts. You can refine them 
further by using the Filter By drop-down list. You can filter comments by the 
Post Heading, its Type and also by its Status. Some visitors will post unwanted 
comments. In such cases, the Community Server spamming system automatically 
isolates those comments and you can search comments based on the spam criteria. 
The above screenshot implies that the comment that we posted has been published 
on the site. You can click the Unpublish button if you wish not to publish the 
comment on the site.
Comments are not moderated by default.
If comment moderation is enabled then the site administrator will have to approve 
the comment before it is actually published on the blog and the site. In such a case, 
you can use the Bulk Actions button. The Publish Selected button instantly posts 
all the selected comments. The Unpublish Selected button instantly removes all 
the selected comments from the site. You can also use this button to remove a single 
comment. The Delete Selected button immediately deletes all the selected comments 
from the site.
If you click on the link located under the Title column, a window with an enhanced 
text editor will pop up as shown in the next screenshot. You can directly edit the 
comment using the provided interface.

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
As you can see from the above screenshot, you can decide not to publish the 
comment using the Unpublish button. The updated comment will be published as 
soon as you click the Publish button.
Managing Content
In order to manage content, you should first navigate to the Blog Management page 
by selecting the My Blogs link from the Dashboard. Once you are inside the page, 
select the Manage Content link from the navigation panel located on the left-hand 
side to view the settings on it (see screenshot below).
We have already discussed the All Comments option previously in the Managing 
Comments section. Let us examine the functions of the remaining options. 

Working with Blogs
[ 62 ]
Managing Posts
As your blog grows, you will need to manage all the posts made by various owners. 
For this purpose, you can make use of the All Posts option. As soon as you click 
on the link titled All Posts from the navigation panel������������������������������
, you will view a new page as 
shown in the screenshot below:
You can edit a blog entry by selecting the link located under the Title column. You 
can also view and delete the blog entry using the relevant buttons on the right-hand 
side. As you will notice from the above screenshot, there are eight views and one 
comment posted to our sample blog entry. Editing is similar to that when posting a 
blog except that you will be presented with the content that you have already posted.
You can search the blog entries by using different criteria such as Month and also by 
the various categories. For instance, you can search for only those entries posted on 
the Forum in the month of June 2006. For our sample blog, we can only see an entry 
named September 2006 on the Month drop-down list because we have just created 
and started to use the blog. As the site grows, the relevant month and year are 
automatically added to the list. 
You can also search by the publication status of the post. For instance, if there are lot 
of posts pending for publication in a particular month, you can populate them by 
selecting the button Not Published. 
The search facility is extremely useful as you can quickly 
view all the posts made on a particular month as your 
site grows.
Moderating Blogs and Comments
In the previous sections, we have seen that the relevant blog entry and comments are 
immediately posted on the site after its submission. In this section, we will examine 
how to publish the content only after its approval. 
Before you approve a post for publication, you should post it to the blog and modify the 
settings accordingly. For this purpose, click the My Blogs link from the top navigation 

Chapter 3
[ 63 ]
bar inside the Dashboard and select Write a Blog Post located under the Common 
Tasks panel. Enter the required information to create a new blog post as discussed 
previously and select the Save, but don't Publish button. 
We have also chosen to approve all comments submitted for this particular post. For 
this purpose select the option All Comments require Approval from the Comment 
Moderation drop-down list located inside the Advanced Options tab. 
You can now save the post by clicking on the Save, but don't Publish button located 
at the bottom of the page. As soon as you click on the button, a page as shown in the 
following screenshot is displayed:
You will notice from the above screenshot that a cross symbol (
) appears under the 
Published column of the grid. This implies that this post is not published and will 
not be publicly visible on the site until it is approved by the administrator. 
In order to approve the above blog entry, click on the relevant title link from the first 
row of the grid and click the Publish button located at the bottom of the page. You 
will be returned to the grid and the Published column displays a tick symbol 
( 
), which signifies that the post has been approved. You can modify the article if 
you prefer, before its approval. The relevant post will now be visible on the home 
page of the blog and you can click the link labeled Current Blog to view it. 
Approving Comments
Before approving a comment, you should first post a comment by accessing the 
above blog entry. We have already discussed the usage of comments. However, we 
will post a sample comment for the purpose of this discussion. As you will observe, 
the comment will not be visible on the blog page after its submission. This is because 
we have chosen to moderate it. 
In order to approve the comment, you need to select the Review Comments link 
located under the Common Tasks navigation panel. You will notice that the 
comment has not been accepted as the required check mark does not appear under 
the Published column. 

Working with Blogs
[ 64 ]
In order to approve the comment, click on the Publish button. As you may notice, 
the caption of the button will be changed to Unpublish. You can choose whether or 
not to make a particular comment visible on the site by toggling the button. 
Your comment will be immediately approved and will be visible on the relevant 
blog page.
Working with Blog Pages
Sometimes, you will need to publish some content that should not appear on the 
home page of your blog. Instead, you will need to link to that particular content from 
your blog. It is in this case that the importance of separate blog pages comes into the 
picture. Community Server includes built-in support for publishing blog pages.
Posting a blog page is very similar to posting a blog entry. The main difference 
between a post and a blog page is that blog pages are not published to your blog 
aggregate page (the chronological list of new posts to your blog) as explained above 
and are also not included in the blog's RSS feed. A ��������������������������������
blog ����������������������������
 page is simply an easy way 
to publish an article or other content, such as a résumé or About page, along with 
your blog. You can include the URL of the relevant blog page while posting a 
blog entry. 
In order to create a blog page, you need to click the Create a New Page link from 
the Common Tasks section from the left side navigation bar. Enter the required 
information and click on the Publish button. As soon as you click on the button, the 
blog page will be created and will be visible inside the grid on the Blog pages page 
as shown in the screenshot below: 
You will be directly taken to the All Pages page located 
under the Manage Content navigation panel upon clicking 
the Publish button. 
You can search for blog pages by the tags created on the site and also by the 
publication status. You can view a list of all tags created on the site if you pull down 
the Category drop-down list. As you can see from the above screenshot, you can 
view and delete the blog page by using the relevant buttons. 

Chapter 3
[ 65 ]
Working with Tags
Tags are used to organize the content effectively. The advantage of using tags is that 
the visitors can easily find the related content as soon as they click on each one of the 
tags from the home pages of the blogs or forums. You can locate all posts filed under 
a particular tag quickly. In this section, we will examine the creation of tags and also 
their usage in detail.
Tags are also called as Keywords.
In order to create a tag, select the Create New Tag button by clicking the Tags / 
Keywords link located under the Manage Content Panel located inside the Blog 
Management page. A dialog with the title Tag Editor will be displayed. Enter the 
required name and description as shown in the following screenshot and click on the 
Save button to finish the creation of the new tag. 
You should also select the Enabled checkbox so that the relevant tag will be available 
while composing or updating a blog or forum post. Otherwise, the tag will not be 
visible outside the Control Panel.
As soon as the tag is created, it will be displayed on the Tag / Keywords grid as 
shown in the screenshot overleaf:

Working with Blogs
[ 66 ]
As you can see, the grid shows a list of all the tags created on the site. The Last Post 
and Posts columns on the grid will be updated as and when you file a post using the 
created tag. You can also modify and delete a tag using the relevant buttons located 
in the Actions column. 
If the tag is not enabled during its creation then the 
corresponding row on the Published grid will display a 
red X mark.
Working with Blog Lists
If you maintain a full-fledged blog then you might need to maintain a list of 
important website, co-workers, or friends' blog addresses and other related URLs 
in a common place so that you can browse them easily at a later point of time. With 
Community Server, you can easily post the links under different sections, preferably 
called lists. 
Blog lists are also called as Blogrolls.
Before beginning to create links, you have to create relevant List under which you 
will posts these links. From the Manage Content section on the left side navigation 
panel, click on the option titled All Lists. Click on the Create New List button from 
the Blog Lists page. Enter the required information in the Link Category 

Chapter 3
[ 67 ]
Editor dialog as shown in the next screenshot and click on the Save button to create a 
new list named Friends:
As soon as you click on the Save button, the newly created list will be added inside 
the Select a List to Manage drop-down list as shown in the following screenshot:
The next step is to create the relevant items under the list named Friends. For this 
purpose, click the Add List Item button, enter the required information as shown in 
the screenshot below, and click on the Save button to add the relevant item to the list 
named Friends. 

Working with Blogs
[ 68 ]
While the Title and URL fields are compulsory, the Description and Relation(s) 
fields are optional. The relations text field will be automatically populated as you 
select the relevant relation from the Common Relations drop-down list. You will 
have to decide the best relation(s) while adding each list item.
You can specify more than one relation for a contact and 
they are separated by spaces. 
As soon as you click the Save button, the relevant list item will be added inside the 
grid as shown in the screenshot below:
You have successfully added a new list item. You can modify and delete the list 
items using the relevant buttons located under the Actions column. You can also 
modify and delete lists using the Edit List and Delete list buttons located at the top 
of the grid.
Let us now examine how the list items will appear in our sample blog. Navigate to 
the home page by clicking on the Current Blog link. As soon as you click on the link 
titled Links (see the first screenshot below) located under the heading This Blog on 
the right side of the page, you will be taken to the home page of list items as shown 
in the second screenshot below:
As you can see from the above screenshot, the list item that we posted is now visible 
on the site. In the same way, you can create as many lists and list items as per 
your requirements.

[ 69 ]
Working with Snippets
Snippets enable you to quickly create links in your blog posts or pages. This feature 
is useful if you use a resource found on the Web frequently in your content. When 
snippets appear in your blog post or page, a link will be automatically generated to 
the URL that you specified while creating the snippet. Let us now examine how to 
create a snippet for our sample blog. 
Select the link titled Manage Snippets from the Manage Content navigation panel. 
Click on the Create New Snippet button from the Manage Blog Snippets page. 
Enter the required information as shown in the following screenshot:
As soon as you click the Save button, the snippet will be added inside the grid as 
shown in the screenshot below:
The next step is to properly make use of the above created snippet by creating a 
new blog post. For this purpose, click on the Write a Blog Post link located inside 
Common Tasks panel. In order to use the snippet, you should enclose the snippet 
name within square brackets. Otherwise, you will not be able to view the effect when 
you view the blog. 

Working with Blogs
[ 70 ]
For our sample blog post, we have to supply a text such as [CS], where CS is the 
name of the snippet. It will be replaced with the Text and Link URL that we gave at 
the time of its creation (see the screenshot titled Snippet Editor). 
Finally, publish the post and browse to the home page of the blog to view the final 
output as shown below:
Displaying General Information on the Blog
This option lets you supply description that can start from your career history and 
then conclude with the launch of the site on your blog. In order to do this, click on 
the About My Blog link located inside the Manage Content navigation panel on the 
Blog Management page. 
By default, this information will not be displayed on the blog. You can enable it by 
selecting the Yes option from the Display About My Blog setting. You should also 
supply the required title and description in the relevant fields. 
Readers of your blog will be taken to the relevant page when they click on the link 
titled About from the home page of the blog. 
Working with Global Settings
In this section, we will examine how to manage some of the general settings of your 
blog. You should note that any changes to these settings will affect the entire blog. 
You will see a lot of options under the heading Global Settings located on the left 
side navigation panel on the Blog Management page as shown below:

We will examine each one of the above options in the forthcoming sections of 
this chapter.
Supplying Title, Description, and News
You can supply a short title and description of your blog by clicking the Title, 
Description, and News link. The title you enter in the field will be displayed as a 
link at the top of the page. Clicking the link will enable you to browse the home page 
of your blog from within the Blog Management page.
You can also give brief news about the latest happenings or events which may occur 
to your blog. This is an optional setting and the information entered in the news field 
will be displayed on the right side of the home page of the blog as a separate section 
as shown in the following screenshot:
It is also possible to give the required meta tags for all the pages by using Search 
meta Description and Search meta Keywords fields. The information you enter in 
these fields will be displayed when a user performs a search on the Web using search 
engines. The keywords should preferably be separated by commas. 
Changing the Appearance of your Blog
You can modify the look and feel of your blog by using various themes included 
with Community Server. Themes will change the entire behavior of your blog 
including the placement of links by making use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)�����
. In 
order to modify the appearance of your blog, click the Change How My Blog Looks 
link from the left side navigation panel.
A Theme consists of lot of skins in the form of Cascading 
Style Sheet (CSS) and ASP.NET User Control files.
As you can see, the Theme drop-down list displays lot of themes under various 
names. You should select any one of them for your blog. As soon as you select a 
theme, its preview will be displayed at the bottom as shown in the screenshot overleaf. 
This will help you to select another one, if the theme you selected doesn't meet 
your expectations. 

Working with Blogs
[ 72 ]
Modifying a theme using this option will only affect the 
current active blog. If you need to modify themes for 
other blogs, then you should switch blogs by using the 
Select Blog to Manage button located on the extreme 
right-hand side. You can globally specify a theme for all 
the blogs on the site from the blogs section by selecting the 
Administration link from the Dashboard. 
Click on the Save button after selecting a theme. If you now browse the home page 
of this blog by clicking on the Current Blog link at the top of the page you will be 
able to see that the appearance of your blog has been completely changed. 
Several customization packs are available from the 
Downloads section at http://www.communityserver.
org. These packs include additional themes for your blog, 
which you can use to further enhance the appearance of 
your blog.

Configuring Email Settings
You can specify your email address and enable related options by clicking the My 
Email Settings link. First, you should specify an email address in the Blog contact 
email address field, where you wish to receive all communications submitted 
through the contact form on the blog. But you should also select the Enable Contact 
Me option in order to receive those email messages. The email address will not 
be shared or published. However, you can choose to share the email address by 
replying to a message that you receive from the site. 
The final setting on the page, Email Notifications, enables you to disable the 
delivery of email notifications for those comments posted on the site that are rated as 
spam messages. Sometimes, visitors to your blog will post unnecessary comments. 
Community Server automatically isolates those comments as spam. If you enable 
this setting then the user who posts spam messages will not receive an email 
from the system.
Working with Post Settings
You can modify the settings associated with some of the core functionalities such as 
comment moderation, rating, and the display of content on your home page by clicking 
the Default Post Settings link. We will examine each one of the settings in detail.
Allow Comments on my blog
If this is enabled, visitors can post comments to your blog posts. By default, 
comments are enabled. ��������������������������������������������������������
This option applies to all blogs, while the same option 
covered under the Writing Your Blog Entry section applies only to that particular 
entry and overrides this default.
Comment Moderation
You can specify how to publish comments on the blog. By default, all comments are 
published immediately. But if you prefer, you can choose to approve the comments 
before their publication. You should make sure to choose the appropriate option 
from the drop-down list before attempting to publish a blog post. Otherwise, 
comments will be posted even if you enable comment moderation individually while 
posting the blog posts.
Send me email notifications
You can specify whether you should receive email notifications for the feedback 
submissions and comments posted on the site. By default, you will not receive any 
email from the visitors. For instance, if you choose All Comments from the list then 
you will receive email notifications for all the comments posted on the site.

Allow readers to rate posts
If set to yes, registered members can rate all blog posts on a scale of 1 to 5. We will 
examine ratings in detail later on in this chapter. 
Allow tracking of external references to my posts (trackbacks)
If this is enabled, trackbacks or pingbacks will be made on all outgoing links. But 
these will be sent only when the post is published for the first time. They are not sent 
out when you edit a blog post.
New posts are displayed on my blog's homepage
If this is enabled, all new posts will be displayed on the homepage of your blog. The 
relevant blog posts will also be included on the main syndication feeds. 
New posts are displayed on this site's homepage
If this is enabled, all new posts will be displayed on the homepage of your site. 
Publish post excerpts when my content is syndicated (RSS)
If this is enabled, the excerpt that you entered while writing a post will be syndicated 
instead of the entire post. By default, this setting is disabled. 
Auto Name Posts
If this is enabled, Community Server will name your posts based on the title that you 
entered for the blog in the Title, Description, and News page. This setting is enabled 
by default. The title will appear on top of each blog post.
Understanding Blog-Level Settings
In order to access blog-level settings, you should click the Advanced Post Settings 
link from the navigation panel on the left side. You should note that any modification 
to these settings will affect all existing and new blog posts. Let us examine each one 
of the settings in detail:
Allow Anonymous Users to Comment
If this is enabled, anonymous users can post comments to your blog posts. 
Anonymous users are those who are not logged into the site. This setting is disabled 
by default. 
Comment Moderation
The function of this setting has been discussed in the Working with Post Settings 
section. The only difference is that you have the option to Ignore comments if you 
use the setting on this page.

Allow Comments on my blog
The function of this setting has already been discussed in the Working with Post 
Settings section.
Allow tracking of external references to my posts (trackbacks)
The function of this setting has already been discussed in the Working with Post 
Settings section.
Comment Day Limits
You can specify the number of days for which you wish to allow comments for the 
new posts. When the specified number of days expires, new comments will not be 
accepted. For instance, if you set the value to 30 days then your visitors can post their 
comments for the first 30 days from the date of posting of the blog entry. 
Allow readers to rate posts
The function of this setting has already been discussed in the Working with Post 
Settings section.
Understanding Syndication using RSS & 
Atom
Syndication is a new concept introduced when blogs became popular among 
the community. With syndication, your blog posts are transformed into 
industry-standard XML formats and other websites can display them if used 
correctly. Simply speaking, you can aggregate all blog posts made under each blog 
to a single location. In order to enable or disable the relevant settings, click on the 
Syndication Settings link from the navigation panel on the left-hand side. Let us 
now examine each one of the settings in detail:
Enable RSS Syndication
If this is enabled, the blog will generate a, RSS feed, which will be read by RSS or 
feed readers.
Enable RSS Comments
If this is enabled, comments can be posted directly to the relevant blog entry by 
using RSS readers. You should set Enable RSS Comments to true in order to take 
advantage of this feature. 
Enable RSS for Tags
If this is enabled, an RSS hyperlink will be displayed on the search result page while 
performing a search on the site with tags as shown in the following screenshot: 

Working with Blogs
[ 76 ]
Enable Atom Syndication
If this is enabled, the blog will generate an Atom feed that can be read by RSS 
readers. Some readers will support only Atom but some will support both RSS 
and Atom.
Atom is an alternative format to RSS. You will 
find more details about Atom at: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)
Syndicate External Links
If this is enabled, all the external links that you post on the blog entries will be 
syndicated and feed readers will be able to read them. 
By default, the settings Enable RSS Syndication, Enable 
RSS for Tags, and Enable Atom Syndication are enabled. 
From the External Feed URL section you can specify the complete URL of your blog 
feed if you use an external syndication service. 

Chapter 3
[ 77 ]
Working with Spam, Ping, and Cross-Posting 
Settings
Community Server provides a system for site administrators to specify spam and 
ping settings. Clicking the Spam, Ping and Cross-Posting link, will display a page 
with three options. 
The first option enables you to specify custom spam scores. This is a blog-level 
setting and will affect only the current active blog and will override the related score 
set for the site. You can specify scores for flagging comments for moderation and also 
for automatically deleting comments that are recognized as spam. 
With the help of the second option, you can specify the URLs of all the services 
that should be pinged while adding or modifying a blog post. You can include any 
number of URLs separated by semicolons. 
The final option enables you to specify cross-posting settings, but this feature has 
been disabled by default. Refer to the Enable Cross-Posting section of the Managing 
Blogs Globally section below for more information regarding this setting. 
Rating Blog Posts
Rating enables you to give credit to a blog post or an article. For instance, you can 
give a 5 star rating for a high quality post or article. You can give a lower rating if 
you feel that the post or article doesn't meet your expectations. With Community 
Server, you can rate a post very easily. 
In order to rate a blog post, log in as an administrator or as a user and from the home 
page navigate to a blog post for which you wish to give rating. You will now see a 
small rectangle with 5 stars as shown in the next screenshot:
If you point the mouse cursor over the stars, its colour will change as shown in 
the following screenshot. You will also be able to see a tool tip as shown in the 
screenshot if you point the mouse cursor over each star.

Working with Blogs
[ 78 ]
You need to click on the relevant star in order to rate a blog post. The stars will blink 
for a while after you click on them. When the blinking stops, the post will be rated 
and �����������������������������������������������������������������������������
the rating stars will appear on the home page of the blog alongside the post 
heading as shown in the next screenshot:
Managing Blogs Globally
As a site administrator, you can specify permissions and other related settings for the 
management and appearance of blogs globally. In this section, we will examine these 
options in detail. 
Firstly, you should log in as an administrator and open the Dashboard by clicking 
on the Control Panel link located at the top of the page. Once you are inside the 
Dashboard click on the link titled Administration. You will see a new page with 
the caption Site Administration. From the page, you can give permissions for 
various applications included with Community Server. You should note that any 
modification to any of the settings will affect the whole site globally. 
Pull down the Blogs link from the navigation panel located on the left side. You will 
see a series of options. We have already examined the first three options in the earlier 
sections of this chapter. Let us examine the other options.
The Global Permissions option enables you to specify various permissions 
globally. You can, however, modify them individually for each blog at the time of 
its creation. 
The Default Settings option includes several settings for the management of blogs. 
We will examine each one of them in detail:

Chapter 3
[ 79 ]
Create Directories
If this is enabled, a new directory will be created for each new blog. The advantage 
of this feature is that you can access the blog without specifying default.aspx at the 
end of the URL. This setting is enabled by default. 
Auto Create
If this is enabled, a new blog will be automatically created when a new user registers 
on the site. 
Enable Cross-Posting
If this is enabled, the blog owners can cross-post all the entries to one or more remote 
blogs by taking advantage of the metaWeblog Application Programming Interface. 
This feature is disabled by default. If you enable it then you can set up remote 
blogs by clicking the Spam������������������������
, Ping and Cross-Posting link located under the Global 
Settings section inside your Blog Management area. You will be asked to give the 
required username, password, and other related settings. Whenever you post a blog 
entry from your Community Server site, it will be also posted to the specified remote 
blog provided, if the settings given are correct.

If this is enabled, blog owners can add raw content such as meta tags and JavaScript 
to their blog pages inside the Head tag.
Default Group
You can specify a default blog group using this setting. All new blogs will be added 
to this group. 
Default Ping Services
You can include the URLs that Community Server should ping while adding or 
modifying a blog post. By default four URLs are included, but you can add more if 
required. Each URL should be separated by semicolons.
Default Aggregate Tags
With the help of this setting, you can specify a list of tags that will be included on the 
home page of the blog and on the RSS feeds, by default. These tags will be visible to 
all blog owners. 
Service Post Count Limit
This setting enables you to specify the maximum number of posts that should 
be returned by the Community Server web services such as CS Weblog and 
metaWeblog services.

Working with Blogs
[ 80 ]
The Default Presentation option enables you to specify the settings related to 
appearance of the blog and blog posts. 
Enable Themes
You can enable themes using this setting. The blog owners will be able to choose one 
of the themes from the provided list, which will ultimately change the look and feel 
of their blog. This setting is enabled by default. 
Default Theme
You can select a theme that will be used for all new blogs created on the site by 
default. However, blog owners can change it from the Blog Management page. 
Aggregate Post Count
You can specify the maximum number of posts that should be displayed on the 
aggregate home page of the blog on the site. The page can be accessed by clicking 
the Blogs link from the home page of the site. The default value for this setting is 25. 
Hence, the first 25 posts will be visible on the home page and the remaining posts 
will be automatically paginated. 
Individual Blog Post Count
You can specify the maximum number of posts that should be displayed on the 
home page of the individual blog. The default value for this setting is 15. Hence, 
the first 15 posts will be visible on the home page and the remaining posts will be 
automatically paginated. 
Service Post Count Limit
You can specify the maximum number of posts that should be displayed by the CS 
web services such as CS Weblog and metaWeblog services. The default value for 
this setting is 25. Hence, the first 25 posts will be visible on the home page and the 
remaining posts will be automatically paginated. 
Aggregate Post Excerpt Size
With the help of this setting, you can specify the maximum number of characters for 
each post that should be displayed on the aggregate home page of the community. 
The default value for this setting is 250. 
The Enable Post Relevance Sorting setting inside the Post Relevance Sorting section 
enables you to specify the settings related to the relevance of blog posts. Community 
Server considers the various factors, using which your posts are sorted and 
displayed on the site. The advantage of this setting is that the popular posts appear 
on the home page much longer than those posts with less importance. The blog home 
page always displays posts with high importance. This setting is disabled by default.

Configuring Blogs for Members
We have so far examined the creation and management of blogs as an administrator. 
Let us now discuss how to configure a blog for a registered member on the site. We 
assume that you are the site administrator. This is the kind of job that you will likely 
implement if your site is especially oriented for a big community. 
For example, msmvps.com is a site that provides separate blogs for every Microsoft 
Most Valuable Professional. The site is of course maintained by one administrator, 
but a lot of MVPs, including the author of this book, have separate blog accounts on 
the site. 
To configure a blog for a registered member, you will have to follow certain basic 
steps as outlined below
1.	 Ask the member to register on the site.
2.	 Get the username from that specific member for whom you wish to create 
a blog.
3.	 Log in as an administrator, create a new blog and give ownership rights to 
that specific member.
4.	 Inform the member about the URL of the blog.
Refer to the section Creating a Blog for more information 
regarding blog creation.
Once the above-mentioned steps are completed then the specific member to whom 
you gave access to manage the blog can log in to the site and begin to work on 
their blog. 
The registered member should log in to the site by using the 
URL to manage the blog.
Initially, the blog home page will not display any content or the relevant links 
for managing the blog (see the next screenshot). However, members can view the 
blog entries of the entire site by selecting Entire Site from the search section located 
at the top of the page. 

Working with Blogs
[ 82 ]
But as soon as a member logs in the above panel will display the relevant links for 
managing the blog as shown in the screenshot below:
If you compare the two screenshots displayed opposite, you can see that a new 
section with the title Common Tasks has appeared after the member has logged into 
the site. 

Chapter 3
[ 83 ]
The owner of the blog should click the link titled Write a Blog Post to compose a 
new blog entry and My Blog Dashboard to navigate to the Blog Management page 
of the Control Panel (see screenshot below). 
As you can see from the above screenshot, the user interface looks very similar to 
the set of links that we examined earlier. The Current Blog section displays a link 
with the title of the blog being maintained by the member and not that of our sample 
blog. The only notable difference is that the owner will have control over only their 
blog and not others. For instance, if the specific owner navigates to the All Posts area 
inside the Manage Content section, they will not be able to view the blog entries 
posted by all blog owners. The relevant posts will appear as and when the owner 
of the blog submits content in the form of posts and blog pages. Moreover, the Blog 
Author(s) and General Statistics of the My Blog Dashboard will be updated as soon 
as the owner begins to work on the blog. 
If the site administrator creates another blog for the same owner then it will also 
appear inside the blog Dashboard and it can be viewed if the blog owner clicks the 
Select Blog to Manage button located at the top of the page.

Summary
Blogs are a simple and easy way to allow people to publish ideas, thoughts, or 
feedback. Community Server provides a complete blogging platform that helps 
users set up and use blogs effectively. This chapter helped you to understand 
all the essential theories behind the blog application shipped with Community 
Server. We thoroughly examined all the key aspects associated with blogs such as 
creation of tags, snippets, and lists, syndication, and rating with a help of a sample 
blog. Towards the end, we also examined how to configure and set up a blog for a 
registered member. The next chapter will explain how to create and manage forums 
using Community Server.

Working with Forums
In the previous chapter, we examined the creation and management of blogs. In this 
chapter, we will examine another Community Server application, forums. You will 
learn how to create, manage, and administer discussion forums. Towards the end of 
this chapter, we will investigate the home page of forums from the points of view of 
an Administrator and User, and also the aspects involved with personalization of the 
forum home page. 
A Brief History of Forums
An effective communication channel is a must for any individual or business to 
succeed. Even though there are numerous ways such as letters, email, and telephone, 
they are restricted to the people who are communicating. This means that other 
individuals can't benefit from their conversation. Web-based discussion forums 
allow conversations to be shared among a group of people and archived for 
future participants.
Forums play a very crucial role in our day-to-day life ������������������������
where communication via 
technology is involved�����������������������������������������������������������
. They are used as a standard communication tool for small 
groups, organizations, and large businesses. Each and every kind of business has 
its own forums on their website. For instance, a web hosting company can host a 
forum on its website to provide support and assistance for its customers. In a 
similar way, a medical professional can host a forum to provide assistance and 
also to create awareness about various types of diseases, treatments, and other 
health-related issues. 
With web discussions not only can end users post their questions for expert opinion 
but other users also can get benefit from the previous postings. Sometimes, a solution 
that one user has been looking for might have already been provided by another 
user and this reduces the time required for disposal of issues. It is difficult to 
develop fully fledged forum software within a few days. It requires a huge effort of a 

Working with Forums
[ 86 ]
large number of developers. It is in this situation that the importance of ready-made 
forum-development software comes into the picture. Many companies have released 
forum applications using various technologies such as PHP, ASP, and ASP.NET over 
the last several years. PHP-based forums were the first to be introduced followed by 
ASP and ASP.NET. 
ASP.NET-based forums are becoming more popular because of the unique simplicity 
and customization capabilities of ASP.NET. Forums are managed with the help of a 
database, which will run in the background. While PHP-based forums make use of a 
MySQL database, ASP, and ASP.NET based products use either Microsoft Access, 
or SQL Server 2000, or SQL Server 2005. Community Server includes a powerful 
built-in forums application as shown in the screenshot below:
You can also see forums powered with Community Server live at several websites 
such as http://communityserver.org/forums/default.aspx, http://forums.
xbox.com, http://forums.asp.net, �����
 ����
and� http://www.aspnix.com/forums/
default.aspx. You can either deploy them as a single standalone application or 
they can run as integrated solutions along with other Community Server applications 

Chapter 4
[ 87 ]
such as blogs and photo galleries. Forums do not require separate installation as they 
are a part of Community Server. You will learn about the creation and management 
of forums in the forthcoming sections of this chapter.
Getting Started: A Sample Forum
We will demonstrate the concepts with the help of a sample forum meant for 
developers. After the creation of the forum, you will be able to post and reply 
queries regarding various programming languages and technologies used by the 
majority of developers. 
Before proceeding further you should log in to the Community Server as a user with 
administration privileges. This can be done by visiting the home page and signing in 
using the Administrator username and password you configured during installation. 
As with blogs, forums also have a separate home page. For our sample forum, its 
web address will look like http://localhost/cs21/forums/default.aspx. 
The initial home page from the point of view of an Administrator will appear as 
shown below:
The page shown above will look similar for other users when they visit this page as 
they will be shown a list of forum groups. However, the list of forums may not be 
the same, as it depends upon the user's permission levels. Forums support private 
forums, controlled by permissions, and in the screenshot above you can see forums 
only available to a site Administrator. Let us now examine each section of the default 
home page of the forum in detail.

Working with Forums
[ 88 ]
By default, the installer creates two forums: Reporting Forums and Deleted Posts. 
T�������
hese forums are solely meant for Administrators and will not be visible for end users. 
Reporting Forums: If users report problems with posts from other forums, their 
messages will show up in Reporting Forums.
Deleted Posts: When posts are deleted they are moved to this forum. The Deleted 
Posts forum is similar to the Windows recycle bin.
In the screenshot on the previous page you can see that the home page displays the 
total number of registered members and guests who are currently online. Guests are 
anonymous people that are browsing but have not signed in. The Forum Statistics 
section will show how many users have contributed to the forums, the number of 
threads posted, and the newest member. 
In forums parlance, a thread is a group of related messages.
Introduction to Creating Forums
In order to create a forum, click on the Control Panel link from the top navigation bar 
of the home page. You will see a new page with the title Dashboard. Here click on 
the link titled Add new forums, control permissions, etc. located under the heading 
Forums Administration to navigate to the Site Administration page. 
You can also access the Site Administration page by 
clicking on the Control Panel link and then selecting the 
Administration link from the navigation bar located at the 
top of the page. 

Chapter 4
[ 89 ]
You will now see a set of six links under the heading Forums as shown below:
Before creating the required forums on the site, you should first create relevant 
forum groups, so that you can file each forum under the appropriate group. Let us 
examine how to create the required groups for our sample forum.
Creating Forum Groups
In order to create forum groups, click on the link titled Forum Groups from 
the Forums navigation panel. You can see that two new groups with the name 
Administrators ����
and Sample Forums have been automatically created after installation.
For our sample forum, we will create two groups with the name ��������������
Microsoft ����
and 
Non‑Microsoft���������������������������������������
. To create these groups, click on the New Group button and enter the 
required information as shown in the screenshot below:
The Group Description can be of any length but it is a recommended practice to 
restrict it to one or two sentences for the sake of clarity. Clicking the Save button 
located at the bottom of the page will add the group to the grid displaying forum 
groups. In the same way, create another group called Non-Microsoft by supplying 
the required information as explained above. 

Working with Forums
[ 90 ]
After the creation of groups, the grid inside the forum groups page will appear as 
shown in the next screenshot.
You can edit the group name and description by selecting the Edit button. You can 
directly manage the relevant forums filed under a specific group by clicking the 
Manage button from the appropriate row. For simplicity, you can also modify the 
look and feel of the page to tree-view format, if you prefer.
We have now created the forum groups required for our sample forum. Let us now 
examine the creation of forums.
Creating Forums
In order to create the required forums, click on the Create New Forum link in 
the Forums section from the navigation panel located on the left side of the Site 
Administration page. You will view a page with four tabs: Basic, Advanced, 
User Permissions, and Admin Permissions as shown in the following screenshot. 
You need to first enter the required information such as a name for the forum, 
description, etc. using the Basic and Advanced tabs. You should also specify 
permissions using the User and Admin Permissions tabs. 

Chapter 4
[ 91 ]
We will now create the required forums for our group Microsoft. For this purpose, 
we will create a new forum with the name ASP. We will supply a short description 
such as "Discuss Classic ASP here" for our forum. 
Let's look at the tabs in detail.
Basic
The Basic tab provides options necessary for creating a forum that are 
described below:
Forum Name: You should specify the name of the forum (e.g. ASP).
Description: You should describe the forum in few lines.
Forum Group: You should specify, appropriate Group Name from the options 
available in the drop-down box (e.g. Microsoft).
Parent Forum: You should specify a parent forum from the drop-down box that will 
contain this forum as subforum.
Enable this Forum: By default, the forum that we created is enabled. If required you 
can select No and then enable it when you are ready to launch the forum. If disabled, 
the forum will not be visible outside Administrator's control panel.
Default Language: You should select the desired language from the drop-down box.
Advanced
The Advanced tab provides facilities to perform some of the other tasks associated 
with forums as described below:
URL: You should specify a URL if you wish to use the forum that you created as a 
tracked link.

Working with Forums
[ 92 ]
Index Posts: If this is enabled, all the posts posted under the specific forum are 
indexed for searching.
Moderate Posts: If this is enabled, all the posts posted under the specific forum 
require approval from the concerned person or moderator before publication on the 
forum. A moderator can either be an Administrator or any other person approved by 
the Administrator. By default, this feature is disabled. 
Enable Post Statistics: If this is enabled, the posts are counted and displayed below 
the Username of each user. This enables an Administrator to determine how many 
posts a specific user has contributed to the Forum.
Enable Post Points: If this is enabled, the posts are given points and the relevant 
points are displayed below the Username of each user. 
Enable Post Auto-Delete: If this is enabled, the posts are automatically deleted after 
a specified interval.
Auto-Delete Time Window: This denotes the number of days after which the posts 
should be automatically deleted from the specific forum. By default, it is 90 days 
from the date of posting. 
User Permissions
This tab is used to grant permissions to the users accessing the forum. All registered 
users, by default, will have the authority to perform all tasks such as viewing, editing 
of posts, etc. 
Admin Permissions
An Administrator can grant the desired permissions to users, moderators, and others 
using this tab. For our sample forum, we will keep all these settings as such without 
any modifications. 
You can globally give permissions for all the active forums 
from the Global Permissions link located on the left 
navigation panel under the heading Forums.
Finally, click on the Save button to create our new forum named ASP. As soon as 
the forum is created, you will be taken to the Forums page where you will see a 
list of all the forums that have been created on the site, including the default forum 
created by the installer. 

Chapter 4
[ 93 ]
In the similar way, we will create other forums with the names ASP.NET 1.1, ASP.
NET 2.0, and Visual Basic .NET under the Microsoft Group. We will also create four 
forums named PHP, PERL, Java, and Python under the Non-Microsoft group. We 
have now successfully created the required forums under two different groups. 
The forums grid after the creation of all forums will appear as shown in the 
screenshot below: 
You can display the forums based on each group using the Group drop-down box 
located on the right side of the page as shown in the above screenshot. For instance, 
if you select Microsoft, the grid will display only those forums created under that 
group as shown below:
As you can observe from the above screenshot, displaying forums based on group 
name will not only reduce the space but also help you to easily locate and manage 
the forums. 

Working with Forums
[ 94 ]
Viewing Sample Forums
In the previous section, we have seen how to create forums under two different 
groups. Let us now examine how to view the finished home page of our sample forum.
Click on the link titled Exit Control Panel and Return to Site located in the top 
section of the Site Administration page to return to the home page of our site. Select 
the Forums link from the top navigation bar to visit to the home page of our forum 
as shown in the following screenshot. You should note that you are currently logged 
in as an Administrator and the home page is meant for Administrators.

Chapter 4
[ 95 ]
You can also see a forum post under the forum Sample Forums. As noted earlier, this 
forum was automatically created at the time of installation of Community Server. 
Posting a Thread as an Administrator
Let us now discuss how to post a thread to one of our sample forums — ASP.
NET 2.0. We assume that you are logged in as an Administrator. Navigate to the 
home page by clicking on the Forums link from the navigation bar and select the 
appropriate forum. Initially, you will view a page as shown below:
You can sort the posts under the specific forum using different criteria found 
under the Sorting and Notifications panel by clicking the More Options button. In 
addition to this, you can also choose an option for notification. Community Server 
will automatically deliver an email to the logged in user whenever new posts 
are posted to the relevant forum. The panel also shows the various features and 
permissions that are available for the specific forum. 
Click on the Write a New Post button to post a new thread. You will now see a new 
page, which contains a text editor with six tabs as shown below.

Working with Forums
[ 96 ]
By default, a standard text editor with a limited set of options as shown overleaf is 
displayed. You can, however, modify the setting to display an advanced text editor 
with rich features such as ability to change fonts and sizes, insert emoticons, and so on. 
Emoticons are not enabled by default. You have to enable 
them from the Post Settings page located under the 
Settings panel from the Site Administration page. 
The settings can be modified by logging to the site and selecting the username 
displayed as a link at the top of the home page. Select the Site Options tab 
and modify the value of the Content Editor drop-down list from Standard to 
Enhanced and click the Save Changes button. You will see a new text editor with 
a new interface as shown below:
Compose
In order to write a new post, you need to enter the required subject and the content 
for the message in the appropriate fields as shown below:
Field Name
Test Data
Subject
What are the new features of ASP.NET 2.0?
Message
Can anybody post information regarding the new features included 
with ASP.NET 2.0?
Tag
You can also enter the required tags separated by commas, which will 
be displayed on the bottom of each post. You can later on browse the 
forums using these tags. Once your tags have been successfully stored 
inside the Community Server, you can later use them for all future 
posts by selecting the Select Tags button.

Chapter 4
[ 97 ]
You can format the message using the options available in the text editor. For our 
sample post, we will modify the font and size of the message. You can also insert 
emoticons if you wish to display them. But before posting the message, we will 
explore the additional features associated with posts. 
Options
You can manage attachments, sticky posts, etc. by selecting the Options tab while 
posting a new thread. 
File Attachment: You can upload a file, which will be added as an attachment to 
your message. A pop-up dialog will be displayed when you click on the Add/Update 
button in the Options tab. You can either upload a file from your local system or 
specify a web address where the required file is located. 
Do not allow replies: If this is enabled, members cannot post replies to threads. By 
default, this option is disabled.
Stickiness: You can post a thread that will always remain visible for a fixed period of 
days as specified by the Administrator while posting the thread. By default, posts are 
not set as sticky. 
Post Icon: You can pick any one of the smilies from the available list, which will be 
displayed as a first item on the subject line of the corresponding forum. These icons 
reflect the nature of the posts.
Only Administrators can post a Sticky thread. 
Video
You can post videos by using the options available on the Video tab that are 
described below:
Video URL: ����������������������������������������������������������
You can specify a URL where the relevant video is located.
Preview Image URL: ���������������������������������������������������������
You can specify a URL where the preview image is located.
Video Duration: ������������������������������������������
You can specify the duration of the video.
Video Width: ���������������������������������������
You can specify the width of the video.
Video Height: ����������������������������������������
You can specify the height of the video.

Working with Forums
[ 98 ]
Poll
You can convert a regular post into a poll by selecting the Include a Poll in this Post 
option from the Poll tab. An important point to note is that you have to control the 
placement of polls on the message by placing the [Poll] tag appropriately. 
Related
In addition to the above features, you can also view only those messages that relate 
to or closely match the current post. 
Preview
You can also sneak a preview of the post before it is posted to the forum so that you 
can perform any changes if required. 
Posting the Message to the Forum
As soon as you click on the Post button, the message will be added to the relevant 
forum as shown below: 
From the above screenshot, you can observe that the message has been posted by 
a user with the username admin. Moreover, the admin has made a total number of 
five posts. The posts made on the blogs also count towards the total. The page also 
mentions the date on which the user joined the site. As noted earlier, the page also 
displays the tags used for posting this message under the section Filed Under. These 
tags will be available when you submit another post later on. 

Chapter 4
[ 99 ]
Members can rate the post and also activate email subscription. If this feature is 
enabled, members will receive an email as and when a new post has been posted on 
this thread. You can also change the view to Flat View or Threaded View using the 
Change View drop-down list. 
On the right-hand side, you will see a series of buttons, which are used for various 
purposes while working with the relevant post. Let us now explore them in detail.
Replying to a Post
In order to reply to a post, members should click the Reply button from the relevant 
post. The Subject field will be automatically populated with the original title. You 
should enter the required content in the Message field as shown in the following 
screenshot. You can also select the required tags by selecting the Select Tags button 
at the bottom of the page, which is displayed below:
As soon as you click the Post button, t�������������������������������������������
he reply will be displayed as a fresh post 
below the original post. You should note that the Post icon will not be visible on the 
reply unless you specify it again from the Options tab.
Replying to a Post with a Quote
In order to reply to a post with the original post as a quote, members should click the 
Quote button from the relevant post. As soon as you click on the button, a page as 
shown in the following screenshot is displayed:

Working with Forums
[ 100 ]
As you can see, a new tag has been added before and after the message content. 
The reply will be posted along with the original post content. This will help users to 
quickly track the subject being discussed especially if the thread spans several pages. 
Deleting a Post
You can remove a thread or post by selecting the Delete button. For instance, if 
you attempt to delete your sample post, a new page will be displayed as shown in 
the screenshot opposite, which will prompt you to enter a reason for deletion. The 
reason will be logged and the original author of the post will receive an email with a 
message that his/her post has been deleted.  
Deleting the first post in a thread will delete all posts 
(children posts) posted under that particular thread. 
You should note that only Administrators or moderators are able to delete a thread 
or post. 

Chapter 4
[ 101 ]
Editing a Post
In order to modify the content of a post, you should click the Edit button. The 
interface looks similar to the one used for posting a message. The only difference 
is that you will find two text fields with the named as Edit Notes and Current Edit 
Notes at the bottom of the text editor. Even if you submit the form without adding 
any information to these fields, Community Server automatically inserts Edit Notes. 
You should note that an Edit Note once added cannot be modified. You can also pick 
some tags by selecting the Select Tags button.
The Current Edit Notes field is read only.
The Edit Notes text field will not appear on the relevant message page and will be 
visible only to the Administrator or the relevant member upon editing the message. 
Working with ���������
Favorites
In order to use the �������������������������������������������
Favorites ����������������������������������
 feature, you should first select Favorites button. 
Clicking on the drop-down arrow will display a list of three options as shown on the 
next page.

Working with Forums
[ 102 ]
The main purpose of this feature is to increase the points for the relevant user, post, 
or forum that is added as a favorite. You can choose an option according to your 
preference but you should note that adding a user, post, or forum as a favorite affects 
the member points score for that particular user, post, or forum. 
For more information regarding member points, refer to 
Chapter 11 — Working with System Tools.
Managing Contacts
In order to interact with the member who posted the message, you need to click the 
Contact button. Clicking on the drop-down arrow will display a list of options as 
shown below:
From the above screenshot, you will notice that the message has been posted by 
a member with the username admin. With the help of this feature, members can 
send an email or a private message to the member who posted the message. It is 
also possible to view the members's profile and also search for all posts posted by a 
particular member.
As the name suggests, a private message is a message sent 
by a member to another member and will be visible only 
to them. 

Chapter 4
[ 103 ]
For instance, members can send an email to the Administrator from our sample 
forum after navigating to a post made by a member with the username admin 
and selecting the option titled Send admin an email. A pop-up window will be 
displayed as shown below:
Enter the required information and click on the Send Email button to deliver the 
message as an email. Your email address will be displayed at the top of the dialog 
box shown above. 
Community Server uses three different types of text editors 
— Plain, Standard, and Enhanced — for all purposes. You 
can modify them from the Site Options tab from the user 
profile page. In order to access the user profile page, click 
on the username link located at the top on the site. 
In the same way, you can send a private message to any registered member on the 
site including Administrator. Clicking on the option titled Send admin a Private 
Message will display a page with the required options to compose a message. 
Click on the Post button to deliver the message to the recipient after entering the 
requested information. 
Let us now examine how to view a private message. For this purpose, click on the 
link titled Inbox from the top right side of the page, as shown below:
You will see a page as shown in the following screenshot. You can not only read the 
message but also post replies, which will be delivered to the member who posted the 
original message. It is also possible to delete a private message if the message is no 
longer required. 

Working with Forums
[ 104 ]
A private message will be displayed in the same manner as a normal thread as 
shown below:
While an email will be directly delivered to the concerned 
member, a private message will be posted on the site itself. 
A member can view the message by navigating to their 
inbox after logging in to the site.
Moderating a Post
In order to moderate a post, you should click the button captioned Moderate. With 
the help of this option, a moderator can directly edit or delete the post. A moderator 
can also split posts, revoke moderation privileges from a user, or merge two different 
threads having posts with similar subjects. We will discuss more about moderation 
later in this chapter. 
A moderator is a person who is appointed by the 
Administrator to approve and manage posts.

Chapter 4
[ 105 ]
You will notice an IP address and a few links at the bottom of every post page as 
shown below:
The first item 127.0.0.1 is the IP address of the member who posted the relevant 
post. In our sample forum, the Administrator has posted the message from a local 
installation of Community Server. 
Only Administrators can view the IP addresses of members. 
For other people the IP address is not shown (but is still 
stored in the database).
The Report abuse link enables a member to report posts that violate community 
ethics or to report the post as spam to the Administrator. All these reports are stored 
under Reporting Forums, which is created upon installation of Community Server. 
The Quick Reply link enables a member to post a quick reply instead of a detailed 
reply. A pop-up window as shown below will be displayed on clicking the link.

Clicking on the Post button will add the message to the thread as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Sorting and Navigating Posts
You can easily sort the posts using the Sort Posts drop-down box located at the top, 
as shown in the above screenshot. There are two different ways to sort posts: Oldest 
to newest or Newest to oldest. 
You can also navigate between threads using the Previous and Next buttons. This 
feature is useful if the forum contains a lot of threads and requires faster navigation 
than selecting each one of them individually from the home page of the forums.
Threads versus Posts
Let us now examine the relationship between threads and posts. If you browse to the 
home page of the forums, you can see a screenshot as shown on the next page:

Chapter 4
[ 107 ]
From the above screenshot, we can infer that there is one thread and three posts 
under the ASP.NET 2.0 forum. Hence, there can be several posts under a single 
thread. Each new submission posted to the forum is considered as a thread. 
Moderating Posts
Normally, threads and posts are published instantly. Sometimes, approval may be 
required so that you can verify the content of the post before it is published on the 
forum. Approval has to be given by the person appointed by the Administrator and 
that person is identified as a moderator. 
Let us now examine how to moderate a post. Firstly, you should give the required 
permission for the forum that you would like to moderate. For our sample forum, 
we will give the permissions for the forum titled ASP.NET 2.0. Click on the Control 
Panel link from the top navigation bar and select the link titled Add new 
forums, control permissions, etc. located under the Forums Administration section 
from the Dashboard. 
Select the Forums link available under the drop-down of the Forums panel from the 
left-hand side navigation panel, locate the forum titled ASP.NET 2.0 on the grid, and 
select the Edit button located on the grid to manage the forum. Alternatively, you 
can also directly select the forum title captioned ASP.NET 2.0 to manage it. You will 
now see a page with the title Editing Forum: ASP.NET 2.0 with four tabs on it. Click 
the Advanced tab and select the option Yes for the setting Moderate Posts as shown 
on the next page and click Save button located at the bottom of the page.

Working with Forums
[ 108 ]
We have successfully given the required permissions to moderate our sample forum 
named ASP.NET 2.0. Hence, from here onwards, whenever a member submits a post 
it has to be approved by the Administrator before it is visible on the forum. 
In order to submit a post that requires approval from a moderator, we should first 
log out as Administrator and log in as a user. After signing in, select the Forums 
link from the top navigation toolbar, click the forum with the name ASP.NET 2.0 as 
shown in the screenshot below:

Chapter 4
[ 109 ]
Let us now submit a post by clicking on the Write a New Post button. You should 
enter the required information as discussed earlier. As soon as you click on the Post 
button, a page as shown below will be displayed:
We have now successfully posted a thread that has to be approved by the 
moderator appointed by the Administrator. For our sample forum, moderator is the 
Administrator and hence the post will not be visible on the home page of the forums 
until the Administrator approves it. 
You can even browse directly to the relevant sections of the forum by selecting the 
(please select) dropdown as shown in the following screenshot:
As you can see from the above screenshot, you can navigate directly to the Dashboard, 
view private messages, and also navigate to the various forums on the site.

Approving a Post
In order to approve a post that is awaiting moderation, you should log in as an 
Administrator. Hence you should sign out and then sign in using the username and 
password meant for the Administrator. 
As soon as you sign in, click on the Control Panel link located on the top navigation 
bar. Select the link titled Moderate Forums located under the section Forums 
Moderation as shown below. Alternatively, you can also select the Forums 
Moderation button from the navigation toolbar. 
The following page will be displayed on clicking the link Moderate forums.
Select the link Moderate (1) below the column Posts to Moderate to approve the 
post. You will now view a page as shown below:
As you will notice, the page contains many buttons on the top row, which can be 
used for moderating and managing the post. 
As soon as you click on the Approve button the relevant post will be approved 
immediately. If there are more posts pending for moderation the resulting page will 
display those posts. Otherwise, a message Good news! There is nothing waiting to 
be moderated will be displayed. You can check whether the post has been 

Chapter 4
[ 111 ]
approved or not by clicking the Moderation Statistics link from the navigation panel 
located on the left-hand side. 
The Approve and View button can be used to approve and view the post 
immediately after the completion of the moderation process. Its function is similar 
to that of Approve button. The only difference is that you can view the post 
immediately.
The Delete button enables you to delete the post without its being approved. This 
may be required if the post contains material not suitable for the site. Community 
Server will prompt you to enter the reason for deletion of the post. You can choose 
one of the options from the Reason Template drop-down box as shown in the 
following screenshot so that you need not type in a reason.
As soon as you click on the Delete Post button, the relevant post will be transferred 
to the Deleted Posts forum under the Administrators forum group and an email will 
be sent to the original author of the post.

Merging Posts
You can merge two different threads using the Join button. As soon as you click on 
it, a pop-up dialog box will be displayed as shown below:
You should enter the Post ID that you want to merge with the current active post. 
We will merge the current post with the one that we posted earlier. In order to locate 
the Post ID, navigate to the previous post by visiting the relevant forum and locate 
it from the file name of the post. For our sample post, the Post ID is 14. You need to 
enter this number on the Post ID field and click on the Find ThreadID button so that 
Community Server will search for the ID and, if it finds it, will activate the link titled 
Merge Threads
Click on the Merge Threads link to merge the current thread with the one we 
posted previously. 
Let us now navigate to the previous post and check whether the posts have been 
merged or not. Click on the Exit Control Panel and Return to Site link, to return to 
the home page and navigate to the forums home page by selecting the Forums link. 
You will notice that there is only one post that is active. Click on it, scroll down the 

Chapter 4
[ 113 ]
page, and you can see that our post has been merged with the first post as 
shown below.
Moving Posts
Sometimes, members will post threads in wrong forums. For instance, a post meant 
for discussing ASP. NET 2.0 related issues might have been posted at the ASP 
forum. In such a situation, as an Administrator, you need to move the thread to the 
appropriate forum. This can be achieved by using the Move functionality provided 
by Community Server. Let us now examine how to move a post from one forum to 
another. As a first step, you should post a thread to a wrong forum as shown in the 
screenshot on the next page:

Working with Forums
[ 114 ]
You can also select the Move Selected Items button to 
move post(s).
As you can see from the above screenshot, we have posted a thread meant for the 
ASP.NET 2.0 forum into a forum meant for discussing ASP. Let us now examine 
how to move this thread from the ASP forum to the ASP.NET 2.0 forum. 
Navigate to the above thread, click on the option titled Moderate, and choose the 
option Move as shown below:
As soon as you click on the Move option, you will see a page with the caption Move 
Thread. Expand the forum group named Microsoft from the Move To section and 
select the required forum to which you wish to move the thread as shown on the 
next page.

Chapter 4
[ 115 ]
Alternatively, a moderator can also move the post while approving it. Click the 
Move button available on the Posts To Moderate page as shown in the screenshot in 
the Approving a Post section.
As you can observe from the above screenshot, we have moved the thread to the 
correct forum, ASP.NET 2.0. Community Server will automatically deliver an email 
to the member who posted the wrong thread with a message that the thread posted 
has been moved to the correct forum. Finally, click the button captioned Move 
Thread(s) to move the thread. A message Oops! There are either no posts or due to 
a filter there are no posts to display will be displayed since there are now no active 
threads on the ASP forum.

Working with Forums
[ 116 ]
You will be able to view the moved thread if you browse to the ASP.NET 2.0 forum. 
Locking Posts
As your site matures, some posts on the site become outdated. As an Administrator, 
you need to either remove or restrict further responses to those posts. Sometimes, 
you may feel that a particular thread will be useful and other members of the 
community will benefit from the posted content. In such a situation, you can lock the 
thread. When a thread is in locked state, members cannot post a reply but can view 
the content. 
You can lock the thread very easily using Community Server. You need to log in 
as an Administrator and browse to the relevant forum. Click on the Moderate 
drop-down and you will be able to see an option titled Lock. As soon as you click on 
it, the relevant thread will be locked. 

Chapter 4
[ 117 ]
If you feel that the thread needs to be reopened then you can unlock the thread using 
the Unlock option as shown above.
From the above screenshot, you will notice that the Reply, Quote, and Delete 
buttons are not visible when a thread is locked. 
As an Administrator, you can edit the profile of a member 
registered on the site using the Edit User option located 
under the Moderate drop-down box.
Managing Forum Settings Globally
Let us now examine some of the settings that you have to manage while working 
with forums. By default there is no need to modify the value of these settings but 
sometimes there will be a requirement to modify some of them. 
In order to manage forum settings globally, you need to click on the link titled 
Global Forum Settings from the navigation panel located under the Forums section 
on the left side of the Control Panel page. You will see a page with five tabs as 
shown in the screenshot on the next page.

Working with Forums
[ 118 ]
As you can see from the above screenshot these settings are related to threads and 
their management. It is extremely crucial to understand these settings so that you can 
manage forums very effectively as you gain more experience with the system. You 
should also note the fact that the changes made to the above settings will affect all 
active forums on the site. Let us now examine the settings under each tab in detail
Managing General Post Settings
With the help of the options on the General tab, you can manage threads and posts. 
You can specify how many threads and posts should appear under each forum and 
other related settings.

views or hits. 
Popular Posts Age (In Days): This field denotes the number of days a popular post 
should be active. By default, it is 3 days. 
Working with Ranks
As an Administrator, you can specify ranks for your members. You can set a specific 
range within which a member can be assigned an appropriate rank. A rank denotes 
how active a user is within the forum. For instance, a member who posts a minimum 
of 5 posts can be recognized as a Beginner and those who post more than 50 posts 
as Advanced. Let us now examine the steps involved in the creation and 
management of ranks.
Creating a Rank
Firstly, navigate to the Dashboard by selecting the Control Panel link after logging 
in as an Administrator and click the link titled Administration. Pull down the 
Forums panel from the navigation bar located on the left-hand side and click 
Manage Ranks. You will see a new page with an empty grid. In order to create a 
new rank, select the Add A New Rank button and enter the required information on 

Working with Forums
[ 122 ]
the pop-up dialog box as shown in the following screenshot. Click on the Save 
button to add the rank to the forum.
From the above screenshot, you can infer that a member is recognized as a 
Beginner, if that particular member has submitted more than 5 but less than 50 
posts. For instance, if a user submits 20 posts then that user is recognized as a 
Beginner on the forum. You can also upload an icon, preferably an image that 
can be identified with the rank you created. As soon as you click the Save button 
the rank will be added to the grid as shown below: 
Viewing the Rank
In order to view the rank which we created, exit from the Dashboard, navigate to the 
home page of the forum and select a post under any forum. If you have posted more 
than 5 posts then you can view the rank as shown on the next page.

Chapter 4
[ 123 ]
From the above screenshot, you will notice that the user named admin is a Beginner. 
In the same way, you can create any number of ranks depending upon your 
requirements. You can easily manage the created ranks by selecting the Edit and 
Delete buttons. Community Server will prompt you to confirm the action when you 
delete a particular rank. 
Analyzing the Forums Home Page of an 
Administrator
In the previous sections, you have learned about the creation and management 
of forums. Let us now examine the elements inside the forums home page of an 
Administrator as shown on the next page.

Working with Forums
[ 124 ]
As you can see each forum group has been placed inside a separate panel. Each panel 
can be expanded and collapsed as per your requirements. For instance, if you click 
on the group name titled Microsoft, a new page will be displayed that will contain 
only those forums filed under the Microsoft group. 
You should note that these features are available for both 
users and Administrators.
Alternatively, you can also navigate to the relevant forums and posts by selecting 
the required option from the links located below the top navigation bar inside each 
forum page as shown below:
The forum group panels can be expanded and collapsed using the appropriate arrow 
located on the top right-hand side as you can see on the screenshot in the next page.

Chapter 4
[ 125 ]
By default, the arrow located on the top right side in the above screenshot is pointed 
upwards. If you click on it, the arrow will point downwards and the forums under 
that group will not be visible as shown below:
Let us now examine the elements located on the right side of the forums home page. 
Shortcuts 
The first section, Shortcuts, provides the required options for the effective 
management of members and posts.
Viewing a List of All Users
You can quickly view a list of all registered members on the site by selecting the link 
titled View all users. Clicking on it will display a page with various options.

subscriptions is that you will be notified by email if a new thread has been posted on 
the site. 
Popular Tags
The Popular Tags section displays a list of all the tags currently in use on the site. 
Selecting a tag will enable you to navigate to the relevant post on the forum in which 
we have filed that tag as shown on the next page.

Working with Forums
[ 128 ]
If you have filed a particular tag for more than one post then the system will display 
all of them. You can view a list of all the tags by selecting the link titled Browse 
All Tags. 
As your site grows, you will notice that certain tags are 
displayed in a bigger font while others are in a smaller font. 
It is the result of the popularity of the tags and this feature 
is called "tag cloud".
My Discussions
The My Discussions section displays a list of active posts posted by the logged in 
user on the forum.

Most Active Users
The Most Active Users section provides a list of all registered users who are active in 
posting and replying to threads on the forums. 
Analyzing the Forums Home Page of a 
User
The home page from the point of view of a user, as shown in the following 
screenshot, looks very similar to that of the Administrator, which we have seen while 
discussing the previous section. The only notable difference is that forums under the 
Administrators group are not displayed. As noted previously, it will be visible only 
to the Administrators. 
It is not necessary to log in to the site to view the forums 
home page.

Personalizing the Home Page
With the help of the personalization feature, you can quickly filter the list of forums 
displayed. If you observe the screenshot on the previous page, you can see a link 
titled Personalize. Clicking on it will change the home page as shown below:
If you click on the link titled Yes located beside the group name Sample Forums, the 
title of the link will be changed to No as shown in the following screenshot, indicating 
that the home page will not display the posts filed under Sample Forums group.
If you click on the link titled Return To Personalized View now, the home page will 
not show the forums under the group Sample Forums as shown on the next page.

Summary
Forums are an effective tool for enabling people to easily discuss and share 
information. Forums can be deployed either as a knowledge base for providing 
support to your customers or for discussion among peers. This chapter provided 
a comprehensive explanation about the creation, management, usage, and 
personalization of forums capabilities, included within Community Server. We also 
discussed the elements included within the home page of an Administrator and user. 
The next chapter will explain how to create and manage photo and file galleries.


Working with Galleries
In this chapter, you will master how to make use of the photo and file gallery 
capabilities available with Community Server. The chapter is divided in two parts; 
the first part examines the concepts behind the building of a photo gallery by 
creating a sample gallery, which uses the logos supplied by Microsoft for its Most 
Valuable Professionals (MVPs). In the second part of the chapter, we will examine 
the creation of a file gallery by creating a sample gallery using some sample files. 
After reading this chapter, you will have gained sufficient expertise to create and 
maintain photo and file galleries.
About Galleries
Before the advent of the Internet, people used to keep photos of family, friends, 
weddings, vacation trips, and so on in a hard-copy album. While albums haven't 
been completely replaced by online tools, it is cumbersome to maintain and manage 
those hard-copy albums. Moreover, the albums will become unusable over a period 
of time. With the advent of technology, people thought about showcasing photos 
online. Initially, people started to put their photos on their personal websites 
as separate images. Later on automated online photo galleries provided by 
third-party websites caught on. Many companies began to develop custom photo 
gallery applications as well.
With online photo galleries, you can quickly navigate between photos, view 
thumbnails of photos, add comments to photos, easily share photos with other people, 
and do much more. There are separate applications available only for the purpose of 
creating galleries as noted above. But Community Server provides a powerful photo 
and file gallery tool along with its other core applications, blogs and forums. 
Community Server supports a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) gateway that allows 
people to upload, download, and organize files efficiently, controlled through the 
Community Server authentication mechanism. Instead of using FTP to download 

Working with Galleries
[ 134 ]
each and every file, you can just browse to the gallery and download the required 
files as and when they are needed. Moreover, you can organize these files in separate 
groups. Hence, your users can not only browse your blog but also can view your 
photo and file galleries. 
Building a Photo Gallery
A photo gallery is a common feature for displaying pictures on personal websites. It 
provides you with an intuitive way to blend photo management impeccably into a 
website whether it is a small personal site or a large community site.
Creating a Photo Gallery: Getting Started
Before proceeding further you should log in as a user with Community Server 
administration privileges. This can be done by visiting the home page and signing in 
using the Administrator username and password you configured during installation. 
Like blogs and forums, a photo gallery also has a separate home page. It can be 
viewed by visiting the Community Server home page and clicking the link titled 
Photos. By default, the installer creates a sample photo gallery called Sample and 
you can view a sample photo filed under the gallery on the home page. However, 
you can create your own galleries and add photos to them. We will examine all 
the required steps for the creation of a photo gallery with a help of a sample photo 
gallery in the forthcoming sections. We will use the pictures supplied by Microsoft 
for those who have won the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award. 
In order to create a photo gallery, click on the Control Panel link from the top 
navigation bar of the home page. You will see a new page with the title Dashboard. 
Click on the link titled Add new galleries, control permissions, etc. ��������������
located under 
the Photo Administration heading to navigate to the Site Administration page. 
Alternatively, you can also access the Site Administration 
page by clicking on the Control Panel link and then 
selecting the Administration link from the navigation bar 
located at the top of the page. 
You will now see a set of seven links under the Photos section as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 135 ]
Before creating a photo gallery on the site, you should first create photo gallery 
groups so that you can file each gallery under a specific gallery group. Let us 
examine how to create a gallery group for our sample photo gallery.
Creating a Gallery Group
In order to create a gallery group, click on the link titled Gallery Groups available in 
the Photos panel. You can see that a group with the name Sample Photo Galleries 
has been automatically created by the installer.
For our sample photo gallery, we will create a group with the name MVP. To create 
this group, click on the Add New Group button and enter the required information 
as shown in the following screenshot:
Clicking the Save button will add the group named MVP to the grid inside the 
Groups page as shown on the next page.

Working with Galleries
[ 136 ]
In the same way, you can create another group for your gallery depending upon 
your requirements. 
You can edit the group name and description by selecting the Edit button. You can 
directly manage any group by clicking the Manage button from the appropriate row. 
You can also modify the look and feel of the page to tree-view format, if you prefer, 
since it will give you more control over the user interface. We have now created 
the gallery group required for our sample photo gallery. Let us now examine the 
creation of a gallery.
Creating a Photo Gallery
In order to create a photo gallery, click on the Create New Gallery link located under 
the Photos panel on the left side of the Site Administration page. You will see a page 
with six tabs as shown below: 
You can also create a gallery by selecting the Manage 
button from the appropriate row on the Gallery Groups 
page. The Gallery Group drop-down list will be 
automatically populated with the relevant gallery groups 
while creating a new gallery.

Chapter 5
[ 137 ]
Let us discuss these tabs in detail:
Settings
The various options available when the Settings tab is clicked are described below:
Name: You can specify the name of the gallery. For our sample photo gallery, we 
will give the name as MVP Logos.
URL: You can specify a URL to identify a gallery e.g. mvp.
Owner: You can also enter a name of the owner who manages the new gallery. This 
field is to be filled in with the username of a registered member.
Gallery Group: You need to select the appropriate gallery group from the Gallery 
Group drop-down box. For our sample gallery, we should select the group named 
MVP, which we created previously.
Enable Gallery: By default, the gallery that we created is enabled. If required 
you can select No and then enable it when you are ready to launch the gallery. If 
disabled, the gallery will not be visible outside the Dashboard.
Index Photos: By default, the photo galleries are indexed for searching purposes. 
You should select No if you don't want to include your photo gallery to be indexed.
Default Language: Finally, select the desired language from the Default Language 
drop-down box.
Since we are entering the URL as mvp, our sample photo gallery can be accessed by 
supplying the URL http://localhost/cs21/photos/mvp/default.aspx. 
The URL is also called an AppKey.
Permissions
The Permissions tab provides the facility to give access rights to the various kinds of 
users. While registered users can view and post comments to the photos inside 
the gallery, Administrators can perform all these tasks by default. You can modify 
these permissions and also give access to moderators, if you prefer, using the 
various options.

Chapter 5
[ 139 ]
For instance, if you select Date (Ascending) then the photos will be sorted according 
to the ascending order of the date on which the photos were posted into the gallery. 
The default option is Picture Date (Ascending), which means that photos will be 
sorted as per the original date of the photos. 
Quotas
The Quotas tab lets you specify the photo and disk space limits for the gallery as 
described below:
Photo Quota: This option allows you to specify the maximum number of photos that 
are allowed inside our photo gallery.
Disk Quota (kb): This option allows you to specify the maximum amount of disk 
space in KB that is allowed for the gallery.
You should note that the changes to these settings affect only the gallery that you are 
creating and not to the whole site. 
Finally, click on the Save button to create our new gallery named MVP Logos. As 
soon as the gallery is created, you will be taken to the Galleries page where you will 
see a list of all the galleries created on the site including the default gallery named

Preview
The Preview tab provides a facility to view the photo as if it appears inside the 
gallery. The advantage of this feature is that you can immediately modify the photo 
or settings if you are not satisfied with the preview.
By default, you need not modify any settings except the specification of the required 
details on the Content tab. But if you feel that you require a restricted gallery you 
can tweak the gallery using the above mentioned settings. 
After a final check of the above settings, click the Save button to add the photo to the 
gallery. As soon as you click the button, the photo will be added inside the grid on 
the All Photos page as shown below: 
You can add more photos to the gallery by clicking the Add New Photo button. For 
our sample photo gallery, we have added one more photo to the gallery as you can 
see from the above screenshot.
By default, all the photos that are uploaded to the gallery will be displayed on 
the grid. However, you can search for a specific photo by selecting a tag from the 
Album/Tag drop‑down list. You can quickly add a new photo by clicking the 
Browse button located at the bottom of the page. As soon as you select a photo, the

also see a list of  tags available. As noted earlier, if you select a tag you will view the 
photos filed under that tag. You can also manage the gallery using the relevant links 
inside the Common Tasks section, if you have permissions to manage the gallery.  
Posting Comments
Your users can post comments about each of the photos inside the gallery depending 
upon the settings that you gave while adding the photos. These comments will 
be either published immediately or after the approval by the Administrator or 
moderator. As an Administrator, you can manage comments from the Photo 
Management page. 
In order to manage comments, we should first post a comment about one of the 
photos in the gallery. For the purpose of our discussion, we will log in as a user in 
order to post the comment. 
Click the Photos link from the top navigation bar and select a photo. A new page 
with the selected photo at an enlarged size will be displayed. Locate the Comments

Chapter 5
[ 147 ]
website of the user who posted the comment if you click the username after the 
comment has been posted.
Managing Comments
As for blogs, you as an Administrator can also manage comments that are posted 
in the gallery using the Review Comments link located under the Common Tasks 
section from the navigation panel on the left side of the My Photos Dashboard 
page. Alternatively, you can also select the All Comments link from the Manage 
Content section. 
As an Administrator, you can edit comments by selecting the Edit button in the 
Review Comments page as shown in the previous screenshot. A comment editor 
pop‑up box will be displayed where you can update the comment. After entering 
the required information, click the Publish button to save the edited comment and 
return to the Review Comments page. You can also directly view or delete the 
comment using the appropriate buttons. 
Moderating Comments

Management page. 

Working with Galleries
[ 148 ]
For the purpose of our discussion, we will upload a photo to our sample photo 
gallery and enable comment moderation. After adding the photo to the gallery, 
navigate to the home page of the gallery, click the photo, and post a comment.
You can directly navigate to the home page of the photo 
gallery by clicking the link on the Current Photo Gallery 
section at the top of the page. 
You will notice that the comment will not appear immediately after clicking the

Selected Items and click the Go button to approve the comment as shown below: 
As soon as you select the button, the comment will be approved and it will be visible 
on the gallery page. 
Managing Tags
As noted above, you can search the photo gallery using tags. You can either create 
tags separately or can enter the required tags at the time of adding photos to the 
gallery. Once a tag has been added inside Community Server then you can make use 
of it in all the photos that you upload to the gallery. In order to manage the tags, click 
the Tags / Keywords link from the Manage Content section. You will see a page 
with a list of all the tags available in the gallery as shown below:

Chapter 5
[ 149 ]
From the previous screenshot, you can see the number of photos that are filed under 
a particular tag. You can also modify or delete a tag by using the relevant buttons. As 
an Administrator, you can create a new tag by selecting the Create New Album/Tag 
button located at the top of the page. A pop-up dialog box will be displayed where 
you are required to enter the name and description for the tag. You should select the 
Enable Album/Tag checkbox to enable the tag. Otherwise, the tag will not be visible 
outside the Dashboard. 
Let us now create a tag with the name MSDN and description Microsoft Developer 
Network for our sample gallery. The Tags / Keywords page after saving the tag will 
appear as shown in a following screenshot:
As you can see from the screenshot, the tag MSDN appears along with its 
description. We have entered the other tags while adding photos to the gallery. You 
can give a description for these tags by selecting the Edit button located on each row. 
Working with Albums
There are two methods by which you can categorize your photo gallery. One method 
is to make use of tags as discussed above. Tags are a new feature introduced in the 
version 2.1 of Community Server. Prior to the current version, photos were arranged 
and displayed in the gallery using Albums. Albums still exist in version 2.1 but you 
should enable them from the Photo Management page. 
In order to enable albums, navigate to the Photo Management page inside your 
gallery and pull down the Settings section. Select the Post Categorization Settings 
link and choose Albums from the Categorize Photos Using drop-down list. As soon 
as you click the Save button, a new link titled Manage Albums will be added inside 
the Manage Content section. Moreover, the required options for creating an album 
will be visible inside the New Album / Tag �����������������������������������������
pop-up dialog box that will be explained 
in the following section. 

Working with Galleries
[ 150 ]
Community Server automatically converts all the existing 
tags into albums. 
Creating Albums
In order to create a new album, you should first open the Tags / Keywords page by 
selecting the Tags / Keywords link under the Manage Content section. Now select 
the Create New Album/Tag button and enter the required information as shown in 
the screenshot below:
You can nest the above album under any of the available albums by selecting an 
appropriate option from the Parent Album drop‑down list. You can use a photo in 
the gallery to enrich the album. We will retain the settings that are set by default for 
the purpose of our sample album. 
The album Windows Vista will be added inside the grid as soon as you click the 
Save button. You can alter the appearance of existing albums by selecting the Edit 
button from the grid.
If you examine the home page of the gallery, you can see some changes to the left 
side such as activation of album links and the addition of a new section titled Album 
List as shown in the screenshot on next page.

Chapter 5
[ 151 ]
From the above screenshot, you can infer that there are two photos inside the albums 
named Microsoft and MVP. You should note that you cannot search the gallery 
using tags, unless you modify the setting inside the Post Categorization Settings 
page as explained before.
Managing Albums
In order to manage albums, click the link titled Manage Albums located under the 
Manage Content panel on the left-hand side. The Album Manager will be displayed 
in a tree-view format as shown in the screenshot overleaf:

Working with Galleries
[ 152 ]
You need to click an album name from the Tags / Keywords panel to view the 
photos inside a specific album. For instance, we have selected an album named MVP 
and the above screenshot displays the photos under it. You can directly modify the 
content and settings of each one of the photos inside a specific album using the 
Edit button.
You can perform various activities from the Tags / Keywords panel. You can not 
only modify and view the photos inside the specific album but also create or rename 
an album, and drag‑and‑drop photos to the album. For instance, to rename an album 
you just need to click the specific album name from the Tags / Keywords panel as 
shown below:

Chapter 5
[ 153 ]
After entering a new name, click anywhere on the page or press Enter to save it. You 
can drag‑and‑drop a photo from one album to another from the Album Manager 
page. Let us now create another album and examine the drag‑and‑drop functionality. 
For this purpose, we will create a new album with the name ANAND_MVP.� 
In order to create a new album from within the Album Manager page, right‑click 
the \ (root) folder and select the Add New option from the pop‑up menu. The page 
will be refreshed and a new album titled New Album �������������������������
will be added inside the Tags 
/ Keywords panel. For our sample gallery, we will alter its name and the page will 
appear as shown below:
 
We have now created a new album named ANAND_MVP. We will drag a 
photo from our album MVP to the newly created album instead of uploading it. 
For this purpose, select the album MVP and drag a photo from it and drop it on 
ANAND_MVP. You need to hold down the mouse button until the photo has been 
dropped on the target album.
The page will be refreshed after the completion of the process and the dragged photo 
will appear inside our new album as shown in the screenshot.

Working with Galleries
[ 154 ]
We have now added a photo from one album to another in a very simple way. In a 
similar way, you can drag-and-drop any number of photos to the required albums 
using the intuitive interface from the Album Manager page. 
Customizing your Photo Gallery
In the previous sections, you learned how to create and manage a photo gallery. 
Let us now examine how to modify some of the general settings associated with 
your gallery. In order to modify the settings, expand the Settings section from the 
navigation panel located on the left side of the Photo Management page. You will 
now see a list of options as shown below: 
With the help of these options, you can modify the look and feel of your gallery in 
addition to managing other advanced settings. Let us now examine the usage of each 
of these settings in detail.
Modifying the Title and Description
You can modify the title and description of your photo gallery by selecting the Title 
and Description link. You can also enter the required description on the relevant 
field. By default, the title will be displayed as MVP Logos, which was entered while 
creating the gallery. It is also displayed on the top heading along with the caption 
Current Photo Gallery on the homepage of the gallery page. 
You can also supply the required description and keywords for search engines. 
Modifying the Appearance of your Gallery
In order to modify the look and feel of the gallery, you should click the link titled 
Change How My Gallery Looks. It consists of tabs that are explained next:

view the albums inside your gallery as shown below:
Configuring the About Page
You can specify the required information that should be displayed when your 
visitors click on the About link present on the home page of your gallery, by clicking 
the About My Gallery link available under the Settings section. The About My 
Gallery page appears as shown in the screenshot.

Chapter 5
[ 157 ]
You should note that the About link will be visible only if you enable it by using the 
Enable About option. By default, the link is enabled. You can, however, disable it if 
you don't want to provide the About page. The Title field will be populated with the 
relevant title corresponding to your gallery. We have entered a short description for 
the purpose of our discussion. 
The above-mentioned details will be visible when a user clicks the link titled About 
from the home page of the gallery. 
Changing the Categorization Method
You can modify the manner in which the gallery should be displayed by selecting 
the required option from the Categorize Photos Using drop‑down list. By default, 
the photos will be arranged and displayed in the gallery according to tags. You can 
change it to albums, if you prefer.
Refer to sections Managing Tags and Managing Albums for 
more information regarding the usage of tags and albums. 
Managing Post Settings
You can manage the settings relevant to your gallery by using the Default Post 
Settings and Advanced Post Settings options. 
Default Post Settings
You can modify some of the general settings related to the day-to-day management 
of your gallery by selecting the Default Post Settings link. You should note that any 
modification to any of these settings will be applicable only to new posts. Hence, they 
are called post‑level settings. Let us examine each one of these settings in detail:
Enable Comments: �������������������
If enabled, users can post comments about the photos available 
in the gallery.
Comment Publishing: �������������������
You can specify the manner in which the comments should be 
published on the site. By default, all comments will be published immediately in the 
gallery. As an Administrator, you can select the option to approve comments before 
they are published to avoid unwanted comments appearing on the site.
Email Feedback Notifications: �������������������
You can specify which notification of feedback you 
would like to receive through email. You can select All Feedback or All Comments 

Working with Galleries
[ 158 ]
from the drop-down list. For instance, if you select All Comments then you will 
receive an email as and when a new comment has been posted on the site.
Enable Ratings: ���������������������������
If this is enabled, registered users can rate photos in the gallery. A 
user should be logged into the site in order to rate a photo in the gallery.
Enable Trackbacks: ���������������������������
If this is enabled, trackbacks will be made on all outgoing links.
Enable Order Prints: If this is enabled, photos will be delivered to Shutterfly for 
printing. The relevant links will be automatically created for this purpose.
Publish to my aggregate list: ���������������������������
If this is enabled, the photos will be included in the 
home page of your photo gallery and main syndication feed.
Publish to site's aggregate list: ���������������������������
If this is enabled, the photos will be included in the 
RSS feed on the whole site.
Syndicate Excerpt: If this is enabled all the excerpts posted while adding a photo to 
the gallery will be included in the RSS feed instead of the description.
Managing Advanced Post Settings
With the help of the Advanced Post Settings page, you can modify settings 
related to comments, ratings, and other related options. You should note that any 
modifications to these settings will affect the whole gallery. Let us examine each one 
of these settings in detail:
Allow Replies/Comments: If this is enabled, replies and comments can be posted 
to each photo in the gallery. This setting will override any photo‑level setting 
made before. 
Comment Moderation: The functioning of this setting is similar to that of the 
Comment Publishing setting, which we examined in the previous section. The only 
difference is that any modification to this setting will override ������������������������
the photo‑level setting 
made in the Default Post Settings page. 
Enable Ratings, Enable Trackbacks, Enable Order Prints: The functioning of these 
settings is similar to that of the corresponding settings that we examined in the 
previous section. The only difference is that any modification to these settings on the 
page will override the photo-level setting set in the Default Post Settings page. 
Comment Day Limits: With the help of this setting, you can specify the number of 
days for which a new photo in the gallery should accept comments. 

Chapter 5
[ 159 ]
For instance, if you set the value to 90 Days then your visitors can submit comments 
about the photos inside the gallery for a period of 90 days from the date of their 
publication. By default, comments can be posted without any limits as the value is 
set to Always as shown in the above screenshot. 
Managing Advanced Photo Settings
You can manage some of the advanced functionalities such as width and height, 
watermark, and other related settings by selecting the Advanced Photo Settings 
link. As soon as you click the link, a new page with four tabs will be displayed as 
shown below:
As you can see from the above screenshot, the Size tab includes lot of options such 
as Width, Height, Quality, and Brightness for managing the sizes of a photo. 
Community Server will use the values supplied here to display the photos, when 
you select the options for each photo. You can also view a snapshot of each size by 
clicking the Preview button.

Working with Galleries
[ 160 ]
From the previous screenshot, you will see that the size of the cache has been quoted 
in kb (Kilobytes). This means that as you view each photo, some disk space will be 
consumed by the cache. As your site grows, you will be required to recycle the cache 
space. This can be done by using the relevant buttons available on the page. 
While the Clean Cache button enables you to clear all the larger items from the 
cache space while keeping the thumbnails intact, Clear Cache button enables you to 
completely remove all the items from the cache. 
Watermarking Photos
Watermarking is a mechanism by which you can insert text or images into the photos 
in the gallery. With Community Server, you can easily insert watermarks. Selecting 
the Watermark tab displays a set of options as shown below:
First, you need to specify the type and position of watermark and then the text that 
should be displayed as a watermark. You can also upload an image that will be 
displayed as a watermark.
Watermarks are automatically placed on all photos in the 
gallery until you disable them. 
Let us now examine how to insert the text MVP on the Top Left corner of the photos 
in the gallery. We need to select the type and position of the watermark from the 
appropriate drop‑down list, enter the required text in the Watermark Text field as 
shown on the next page, and submit the form by clicking the Save button located at 
the bottom of the page.

Chapter 5
[ 161 ]
In order to view the watermark, like the one that appears below, you will have to 
navigate to the home page of your photo gallery and select a photo from it. 
You can directly access the home page of a photo gallery 
by clicking on the link associated with the caption Current 
Photo Gallery from the Photo Management page. 
Displaying the Properties of a Photo
You can permit users to view the properties of each and every photo on the Photo 
Details page when they browse the gallery. This will be possible only if you have 
enabled the EXIF option from the EXIF tab on the Advanced Photo Settings page. As 
you will see, EXIF will be enabled by default.
EXIF is a standard for storing metadata with digital 
pictures and it stands for Exchangeable Image File 
Format. You will find more information at: 
http://www.exif.org/ 
You need to select one or more properties from ����
the EXIF Properties drop‑down list 
as shown overleaf:

[ 162 ]
The values of the selected properties will be displayed only if the relevant photo 
supports them. 
Importing Photos
With the help of this feature, the photos that you have placed manually inside the 
relevant photo gallery directory located inside the /cs21/photos/ directory can be 
imported into to your gallery. You can import these photos either to the root of the 
gallery or to any one of the albums that you have created previously. The required 
functionality for this feature can be accessed from the Import tab located on the 
Advanced Photo Settings page.
For our sample gallery, we will place the photos inside the mvp directory located 
inside Inetpub\wwwroot\cs21\photos directory. You should note that the mvp 
directory will be automatically created upon the successful creation of a new 
gallery. As soon as we place the photo inside this directory, the relevant entry on the 
Advanced Photo Settings page will display the number of photos that are located 
under the relevant gallery directory as shown below:
You can import the photo to any one of the albums that you created. For our 
sample photo gallery, we will import the photo to the album named MVP. Select 
the appropriate album name from Import Files Into drop-down box. Clicking the 
Import button will add the photo to the gallery and the following message will be 
displayed on the bottom of the page.
1 photo(s) queued for importing. Depending on the number of photos, it may take 
a while for them to be imported, as only a few are processed at a time.

Chapter 5
[ 163 ]
Finally, select the Save button to finish the process. The imported photo will be 
displayed depending upon the number of photos in the queue. For our sample photo 
gallery, we have imported only one photo and hence it should have been properly 
imported into the appropriate album. The photo can be viewed by navigating to the 
home page of the gallery.
Advanced Syndication Settings
With the help of Advanced Syndication Settings, you can enable RSS syndication for 
your gallery and also for the comments. By default, RSS Syndication for the gallery 
is enabled. You can, however, enable RSS syndication for comments so that all the 
comments posted in the gallery will be visible on the RSS feeds. 
Building a File Gallery
In the first part of the chapter, you learned how to create and manage a photo 
gallery. Community Server additionally supports a web-based file manager. You can 
use it to post product documentation, code snippets, white papers, and much more. 
In this section, we will examine how to create and manage a file gallery. We will 
make use of a sample chapter of one of the books published by Packt Publishing, a 
PowerPoint presentation, and a Word document to illustrate the concepts. 
Getting Started
Firstly, make sure that you are logged in as an Administrator for creating a file 
gallery. Next, navigate to the Dashboard by clicking on the Control Panel link 
from the top navigation bar. Scroll down the page and select the entry titled 
Add new folders, control permissions, etc. located under the section titled File 
Administration. The Files section will be displayed with a set of four options on the 
left side navigation panel as shown below:
The first step is to create a new folder group. A folder group is an organizational tool 
for file galleries. Next we'll create a folder under the group we created. You cannot 
upload and manage files without creating a folder and you cannot create a folder 
without creating a folder group. However, Community Server installer automatically 
creates a folder group with the name Sample Downloads. Hence if you attempt to 

Working with Galleries
[ 164 ]
create a new folder without creating a folder group, the new folder will be created 
under the Sample Downloads group. 
Creating a Folder Group
As explained above, we will create a sample file gallery which will contain the PDF 
file of a chapter from one of the books published by Packt Publishing. 
In order to create a folder group, click Folder Groups from the Files section and 
select the Add New Folder Group button. As soon as you click the button, a pop‑up 
dialog box with the title New Folder Group will be displayed. Enter the required 
name for the folder group and give a short description for it. For our sample file 
gallery, we have entered the information as shown below:
After entering the required information, click the Save button located at the bottom 
of the dialog-box to create a folder group named Packt. The group will be added to 
the grid on the Folder Groups page as shown below:
As you can see, Community Server installer automatically creates a folder group 
with the name Sample Downloads.
You can edit or delete a group by selecting the appropriate button from the Actions 
column of the relevant folder group. We have now successfully created a folder 
group for our sample file gallery. The next step is to create a new folder and then a 
file in that folder under the above-created group. 

Chapter 5
[ 165 ]
Files are placed inside folders.
Creating a Folder
In order to create a new folder, select the link titled New Folder from the Files 
navigation panel on the left side of the Site Administration page. 
Settings
Firstly, you should enter the required information for the various options under the 
Settings tab. For our sample file gallery, we have entered the information as 
shown below:
As you can see from the above screenshot, we have selected the folder group that we 
created in the previous section. The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for navigating to 
our sample file gallery will be http://localhost/cs21/files/folders/packtpub, 
where packtpub is the value that we gave in the URL field. 
By default, all folders are enabled. If required you can disable a folder but it will 
not be visible outside the Dashboard. The file search or index feature is enabled by 
default. Your users can locate the file while performing a search operation on the file 
gallery. You can also optionally specify a list of users who wish to access the above 
folder in the Owner(s) field. 
Options
The Options tab contains the required settings for the management of files and they 
are explained overleaf:

Working with Galleries
[ 166 ]
Enable External Links: If this is enabled, users can download files through 
redirected URLs. This is a benefit if the files reside in another location and the 
addition to the file gallery is done to help people find these files. This helps to search 
the files present in some external location and add them to the file gallery.
Enable Download Disclaimer: If this is enabled, a disclaimer will be displayed while 
downloading files from the gallery. People attempting to download the file will first 
have to agree with terms displayed in the disclaimer before continuing on to the 
file download.
Allowed File Extensions: You can specify a list of extensions separated by commas. 
If this is enabled only the files with these extensions with be allowed to be uploaded 
in the folder.
Restricted File Extensions: You can specify a list of extensions separated by commas. 
The uploading of files with these extensions will be blocked.
Permissions
The Permissions tab provides more options to control the download and upload of 
files by different users. After checking appropriate permissions, click the Save button 
located at the bottom of the page to create the required folder. The folder will be 
immediately created and will be visible in the grid on the page as shown below:
In addition to our sample folder, you can also see a folder named Sample that has 
been automatically created by the installer. 
The Global Permissions option on the Files navigation panel enables you to specify 
permissions globally to all the folders.
Managing a Folder
You can modify the settings of folders by selecting the Manage button from the 
appropriate row of the folder on the grid. You can also view and manage folders in 
the tree-view format by clicking the button captioned Change to Tree View at the 
bottom of the grid.

Chapter 5
[ 167 ]
Uploading a File
In the previous section, you learned about the creation of a folder group and a new 
folder under that group. Let us now examine the procedure for uploading files to our 
sample folder named Packtpub.
Click the Control Panel link and then select the My Files link from the navigation 
bar located at the top of the page. The My Files Dashboard page will be displayed as 
shown below:
As you can see, the page displays the number of files that have been uploaded to the 
gallery and also information about comments in addition to the owner information 
and creation date. The navigation panel on the left-hand side displays the options for 
managing the active file gallery. You should notice that the Current Folder heading 
at the top of the page displays Packt Publishing as a link, which is the title of our 
sample file gallery. You can switch to another folder by selecting the Select Folder to 
Manage button located at the top right‑hand side of the page. 
In order to upload a file, select the link titled Upload File located under the Common 
Tasks section to open the File Management page. You need to upload a file by 
clicking the Pick File button. A pop-up dialog box with the title Upload File will 
be displayed as shown in the screenshot overleaf. You can either upload a file 
from your system or specify the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) where the 
specified file resides. For our sample file gallery, we will upload a PDF file that is 
available locally.

Working with Galleries
[ 168 ]
As soon as you click the Save button, the relevant file name will be displayed on the 
file editor page as shown in the following screenshot: 
As you can see, we have supplied the required title and a short description for the 
uploaded file. We have also a entered few tags in the Tags field so that a search can 
be performed on the file gallery using these tags. 

Chapter 5
[ 169 ]
With the help of the Options tab, you can choose whether the specific file should 
be published or not. If disabled, files are not visible outside the Control Panel. By 
default, this option is enabled and we will keep it as such for our sample file gallery. 
The Preview tab can be used to view the title and description as they will appear 
inside the file gallery. 
In a similar way, you can upload other files to the gallery. For our sample gallery, we 
will upload a PowerPoint presentation and a Word document as noted earlier. ����
The 
files will be uploaded and added to the grid as shown below on clicking the Save 
button. The files will also be visible on the home page of the file gallery. 
As you can see from the screenshot, you can directly upload a new file using the 
Upload File button, manage tags using the Manage Tags button, search for files using 
tags and the publication status options from the available Filter By drop-down list.
You can also manage files by selecting the Files link located 
under the Manage Content section.
The Administrator can use the Review Files link to approve the publishing of files.
Working with tags in a file gallery is similar to doing so in 
a photo gallery; you can refer to the Managing Tags section 
in this chapter.

Working with Galleries
[ 170 ]
Working with Comments
As an Administrator, you can manage comments posted in the file gallery by your 
visitors. By default, all comments will be immediately published in the file gallery. 
If required, you can choose to approve them before publication. This can be done by 
selecting the Review Comments link from the Files section.
In order to approve comments, you should enable 
comment moderation using the option Moderate 
Comments from the Advanced File Settings page located 
in the Settings panel. 
Let us now post a comment to our sample file gallery. You will have to first log in to 
the Community Server as a user and click the link Downloads from the navigation 
bar. You will see a page displaying all the available files; select a file from the 
home page of the file gallery.
You will see a page with the title that we gave at the time of uploading the file. Scroll 
down to the page and enter the required comment. The Web Site field is optional. 
As soon as you click the Add button, a message box will be displayed stating that 
moderation is currently enabled. 
After adding the comment, log in as Administrator and navigate to the Review 
Comments page, select the comment, and choose the option Approve Selected Items 
from the Actions drop-down box. The comment will be approved and visible in the 
gallery page of the relevant file. 
Approved comments are automatically added to the grid on the Comments page 
located in the Manage Content section. 
You can view, modify, and delete the comment using the appropriate buttons 
from the Actions column after selecting the relevant comment by clicking the 
appropriate checkbox. On clicking the View button, you will be directly taken to the 

Chapter 5
[ 171 ]
relevant page to the file gallery and the comment can be viewed by scrolling down. 
You can also search comments based on their publication status using the options 
from the Filter By drop-down box.
Managing Settings
You can manage some of the advanced settings using the options from the Settings 
section located on the left-hand side navigation panel. Let us examine each one of 
the options in detail:
Title and Description
With the help of the options on this page, you can specify a title and description for 
the gallery. The title specified here will be displayed as a link on the Current Folder 
section in the middle of the File Management page.
Advanced File Settings
You can modify and control the behavior of files within the active gallery with the 
help of this option. The settings included on this page are described below:
Moderate Files: �������������������������
If this is enabled, then the site Administrator needs to approve an 
uploaded file before it is visible in the gallery. This process can be done by selecting 
the Review Files link located under the Common Tasks section. By default, this 
setting is disabled.
Enable File Notifications: If enabled, owners of the specific folder will receive 
an email notification when a new file has been uploaded. By default, this setting 
is disabled.
Enable Ratings: If this is enabled, the uploaded files in a specific folder can be rated 
by registered users on a scale of 1 to 5. By default, this setting is enabled.
Enable Comments: If enabled, registered users can post comments about each 
individual file inside a specific folder. By default, this setting is enabled.
Moderate Comments: If this is enabled, the comments posted by users other than 
Administrators and moderators require approval prior to publication in the gallery. 
By default, this setting is disabled.
Enable Comment Notifications: If this is enabled, owners of the specific folder will 
receive an email notification as and when a new comment has been posted about a 
file inside the folder. By default, this setting is disabled.

Working with Galleries
[ 172 ]
Advanced Syndication Settings
You can enable or disable RSS Syndication for the files inside the folder using the 
relevant setting on this page. You can also enable syndication for tags. By default all 
settings are enabled. 
Disabling a feed will not affect those users who have 
previously subscribed to the feed but it will still stop the 
feed from being displayed within the folder.
Accessing the File Gallery
You can browse the file gallery using various methods. As an Administrator, you 
can directly access the relevant file in the gallery by clicking the View button from 
the grid on the Files page that appears on clicking the Files link under the Manage 
Content section. You can also navigate to the home page of the file gallery by 
clicking the link in the Current Photo Gallery section. 
Your users can access the file gallery by clicking the Downloads link from the 
home page:
As you can see from the above screenshot, Community Server automatically uploads 
a sample file with the title The Latest Community Server Licensing Guide during 
the installation process. You can also see a list of all the files that we uploaded to our 
sample file gallery, which can be downloaded by selecting the Download button. 
As you can observe from the screenshot, the title of the file with most number of 
downloads is displayed in bold.

Chapter 5

A grid will be displayed with a list of all files in the gallery, as shown below, along 
with a button captioned Download(s) Report on each row.
Clicking the Download(s) Report button displays a Download Report page that 
shows download information as shown below:
In order to instantly view the download report, you need to select the Generate 
button and a page as shown below will be displayed. 
As you can see from the above screenshot, the file has been downloaded only once. It 
also shows the date on which the file was last downloaded. 
Alternatively, you can download the report in Microsoft Excel Worksheet format 
by clicking the Export button. The extension of the downloaded Microsoft Excel 
Worksheet file is .csv. It stands for Comma Separated Values and is popularly 
used for generating reports.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the creation and management of photo and file 
galleries using Community Server. You learned the various aspects involved with 
the help of sample photo and file galleries. You also learned the usage of each and 
every setting associated with the functioning of the galleries. The next chapter 
examines the working of the reader and roller functionality.


Working with Reader 
and Roller
Nowadays, a lot of people maintain blogs about a wide range of content. These 
people can be your colleagues, family members, or friends. Sometimes, you may 
find that the blogs maintained by them are useful and you might like to keep a track 
of the content of their blogs. In such a situation, you will need a system by which 
you can combine and populate the posts into a common place, preferably your blog. 
Community Server comes with a powerful and robust features called reader and 
roller, with which you can monitor the content from each blog in which RSS feeds 
are available and display them either on your Community Server site or inside 
the homepage of your blog. The required content will be automatically pulled and 
displayed at regular intervals. In this chapter, we will examine the working of this 
feature with the help of feeds from blogs and websites. 
Overview
The reader feature can be used to display content from the RSS feeds. As an 
administrator, you can grant role-based access to reader for the members of your 
site. Reader is also called Feed Reader and looks very similar to bloglines in terms of 
focus and functionality.
Imagine that you are participating in a TechEd conference being conducted by 
Microsoft. Your local Microsoft office maintains a blog for each and every speaker. 
You need to display all the posts made by those speakers on their blogs, inside your 
Community Server site. Moreover, you also want to display information about 
the latest publications at aspalliance.com. ����������������������������������������
With the help of roller, you can easily 
aggregate the content from various websites into your blog. 

Working with Reader and Roller
[ 178 ]
With the release of Community Server 2.1, roller functionality has been integrated 
with the blogs. Hence, all the content from the relevant RSS feeds will be aggregated 
and displayed inside the relevant blogs. This feature is called Content Mirroring. 
The core theory behind the working of roller is the RSS feeds generated by each 
blog. As you post each blog entry, its corresponding RSS feeds are also updated and 
hence the feeds in your website are also automatically updated upon refreshing. The 
forthcoming sections will examine the usage of reader and roller with the help of the 
feeds from the blogs and websites. 
Working with Reader
In order to work with the reader you should first add the required RSS feeds. For this 
purpose, log-in to the site as an administrator and select the My Reader link from 
the top navigation bar. Right-click the entry titled My Feeds and select New Feed as 
shown in the screenshot below:
By default, a site administrator will have permission to add 
feed URLs. 
As soon as you click the entry, a pop-up dialog with the title Add Feed will 
be displayed. You need to enter the relevant RSS-feed URL as shown in the 
following screenshot:
As you can see, we have entered the feed address of Rob Howard's blog. In the same 
way, you can add the URLs of other feeds. For our sample reader, we will add the 
feed URL of Scott Guthrie's blog (http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/rss.aspx) 
and that of ASPAlliance (http://aspalliance.com/rss.aspx). 

Chapter 6
[ 179 ]
Clicking the Add Feed button will not display any content inside the reader. In 
order to display the content, you need to add the relevant feeds to the reader using 
Aggregated Feeds setting found inside the Dashboard.
Aggregating Feeds
In order to aggregate the RSS feeds, select Control Panel link from the top navigation 
bar after logging into the site as an administrator. Locate the link titled Manage 
feeds, control permissions, etc from the Reader Administration section. The Site 
Administration page will be displayed. You will see a set of four options under the 
section Reader (see the following ����������������������������������������������
screenshot������������������������������������
) on the left-side navigation panel.
You can also grant role-based permissions for each 
registered user of the site to access the reader and manage 
the feeds. The users can post their own unique content from 
the Reader Administration section after logging into their 
site. We will examine this in more detail later on in this 
chapter. 
Click the Aggregated Feeds link and select the Add Feed button inside the page. You 
will see a page titled Add Aggregated Feed as shown in the following screenshot:

Working with Reader and Roller
[ 180 ]
As you can see, the list box displays a list of all feeds that we added using reader. 
As soon as you select the required feeds and click the Add Selected Feeds button, 
the feed URLs will be added inside the reader. You can also see the corresponding 
entries if you click the Manage Feeds link located under the the Reader section. 
You can select multiple feeds by pressing the Ctrl key along 
with the mouse click.
Let us now access the reader to examine the result. Click the link Exit Control Panel 
and Return to Site and select My Reader from the navigation bar on the top of the 
page. You need to expand My Feeds folder to view the feeds (see the screenshot 
below) that we added to the reader from the Dashboard. 
The My Feeds section shows how many posts are there on the homepage of the 
specific website or blog. The title of the relevant website or blog will be automatically 
populated as you can see from the above �����������������������������������������
screenshot�������������������������������
. As you select each feed, its 
corresponding posts will be displayed in two different sections as shown in the 
following �����������
screenshot�:
The middle section titled Posts displays a list of all posts pulled from the 
homepage of Rob Howard's blog along with the title, date, and time. The final 
column displays a detailed view of each post with an excerpt. You can read the post 

Chapter 6
[ 181 ]
either by selecting the title of each post or by clicking the read more link found at the 
end of each excerpt. The relevant post will be opened in a new browser window.
The read more link will not be visible if the post is less than 
250 characters. 
Even if you delete a feed URL from the reader it will still appear on the Aggregated 
Feeds list box inside the Dashboard. This will enable you to add the deleted feed 
again to the reader as and when it is required.
Managing Feeds
You can modify the feed URLs by clicking the Manage Feeds link. As soon as you 
click the link, you will view a page with the title Manage User Feeds with a grid, 
which will be populated with the relevant title, link, and the last updated time as 
shown in the following screenshot:
Clicking the Edit button displays the Feed Editor page as shown in the 
following �����������
screenshot�:

Working with Reader and Roller
[ 182 ]
ETag is a part of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
specification and is used in RSS feeds. You will find more 
information at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/
rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19 or 
http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/rssfeedstate.
html#entitytags.
As you can see from the previous �����������������������������������������������
screenshot�������������������������������������
, most of the settings are read-only 
except for the URL field. You can modify the feed address by supplying a new URL 
in the field. The Feed Editor page shows the title of the blog along with the relevant 
dates. It also displays the current status of the feed in addition to the version and 
build number of Community Server. 
Granting Permissions for Users to Access the 
Reader
You can grant permissions to those users who require access to the feed reader. 
By default, only the site administrator can access the reader. But you can give 
permission to other registered users by granting access to them by using the options 
in the Manage Roles page��������������������������������������������������
. In order to view the page, you should click the Manage 
Access link from the reader section from the Site Administration page. 
You should note that simply giving access to the registered users will not enable 
them to manage the reader. They can, however, view the reader by clicking the My 
Reader link from the top navigation bar. In order to give access to manage the reader 
you should grant role-based permissions by following the steps mentioned below:
1.	 Select the Administration link from the Dashboard.
2.	 Pull down the panel titled Membership from the navigation bar located on 
the left side.
3.	 Click the Browse People link and select a username from the grid on the 
Member Search Results page. 
4.	 Select the Add/Remove Roles link from the Roles section on the Profile page.
5.	 Select the ReaderAdministrator and click the first arrow from the top to add 
the role to the specific user. In the same way, grant permission to the user for 
the reader user-role.
6.	 Click the Save button to finish the process and return to the Profile page. 
7.	 Finally, apply the changes by clicking the Save Changes button located at the 
bottom of the profile page. 

Chapter 6
[ 183 ]
As soon as the registered users log in to the site, they can manage the reader by 
clicking the Control Panel link from the top navigation bar and selecting the Manage 
feeds, control permissions, etc link located under the Reader Administration 
section from the Dashboard. 
Working with Roller
As we examined earlier, the roller feature has been integrated with blogs. All the 
relevant content from the feeds will be visible either inside the blog's homepage 
on the site or on the specific blog in which you have enabled the feed. Let us now 
examine the working of roller in detail.
Firstly, pull down the Blogs section from the Site Administration page and select 
the Blogs link. A grid with a list of all blogs on the site will be displayed as shown in 
the �����������������
screenshot �������
 below:
The functioning of roller is called the content mirroring. Hence, in order to add feeds 
to the blog roller, you need to select the Mirrors button. You will view a page titled 
Mirror Feeds with an empty grid. Selecting the Add New Feed button displays 
a pop-up dialog box. You should enter the required URLs and settings in the 
appropriate fields as shown in the next �����������
screenshot�:

Working with Reader and Roller
[ 184 ]
As you can see, we have specified to pull the posts from the blog maintained by Rob 
Howard. You can optionally specify the relevant site URL of the feed. We have also 
given a title for the feed so that you will know about the purpose of the feed at a later 
stage. Let us now examine the other settings in detail:
Pull Interval
Community Server automatically checks for new posts from the specific feed URL 
based on the value on this field. The default value is 60 minutes. This means that any 
new posts to the related blog/website will be displayed on the blog roller after a gap 
of at most 60 minutes.
Excerpt Size
This setting denotes the number of characters that should be displayed as an excerpt 
on the Blog Roller page. The default value is 250 characters. The excerpt will be 
truncated at the end of the first 250 characters.
Post Full Text
If enabled, the blog roller will display the entire body of the message instead of the 
excerpt. By default, this setting is disabled and it means that an excerpt with 250 
characters will be displayed along with a link to the original URL.
Aggregate in site blog roll 
If enabled, all the posts from the relevant feed will be displayed on the blog 
homepage of the site. 
Aggregate in assigned blog 
If enabled, all the posts from the relevant feed will be displayed on the assigned blog 
homepage. For the purpose of our discussion, we have added a mirror feed to our 
sample blog — csbook. If this setting is enabled then you will be able to view all the 
relevant posts from the feed upon clicking the Blogs link from the homepage of our 
sample site. 
As soon as you click the Add button from the pop-up dialog box, the required details 
will be added to the grid as shown in the following screenshot:
As you can see, the grid displays the name and URL that we entered and also other 
relevant settings. You can also modify and delete the feed using the appropriate 
button located under the Actions column.
You can view the relevant posts from the feed (see the following screenshot) if you 
navigate to the Blogs page of the relevant site to which the mirror feed has been added.

Chapter 6
[ 185 ]
As you can observe from the above screenshot, the excerpt has been truncated, and 
you can view the complete content if you click the relevant title link. In the same 
way, you can add more mirror feeds to the relevant blog and all the posts will be 
aggregated and displayed as shown above. 
Managing Settings
You can modify the feed reader and blog roller options by using the Settings link 
located under the Reader panel inside the Site Administration ���������������������
page. Let us examine 
each one of the settings in detail.
Last Modified Interval
This setting is related to the feed reader. You can specify the time limit (in minutes) 
based on which the modified posts will be pulled. The default setting is two minutes. 
This means that the reader will automatically check for modified feed content on the 
relevant feeds once in every two minutes. 
Truncation Length
You can specify the maximum length of characters for the blog content that should 
be displayed on the blog roller page. The default value is 500 characters. 

Working with Reader and Roller
[ 186 ]
Setting the value of the truncation length to zero displays 
the whole body of each post on the homepage of the 
blog roller.
Page Size
You can specify the maximum number of results that should be displayed per 
page on the Blog Roller page. The default value is 25 results. If you modify it to 100, 
then roller will display 100 blog posts on the first page and then the posts will 
be paginated. 
RSS Result Size
You can specify the maximum number of results that should be returned from the 
RSS feed of the roller. The default value is 25 results.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to work with reader and roller with the help of 
sample feeds. We have examined the steps that have to be followed to con�������
figure� 
a reader. We also demonstrated how to grant role-based permissions for users 
registered on the site to access and manage the reader. Towards the end of the 
chapter, we have examined the required steps to set up the roller in addition to 
important settings associated with reader and roller. In the next chapter, we will 
learn how to manage members registered on the site. 

Managing your 
Community's Users
We have so far discussed the various applications included in Community Server, 
such as blogs, forums, galleries, reader and roller. The remaining chapters will focus 
on the management of members, customization, and generation of reports. In this 
chapter, you will learn how to manage the users that join your community and also 
some of the associated settings. 
The Community's Members
Members are truly the core of Community Server, because without members there 
wouldn't be a community! When enabled, people can join the community to post to 
blogs, forums, photos, files, and more. In most cases, you need not contact each and 
every member. But as your community's administrator, you will need to manage the 
settings associated with the members, such as approval of a new user registration 
and other related tasks. Sometimes, you will be required to search for a specific 
member and also to create new users internally. Community Server includes a 
separate area inside the administrator's Dashboard titled Memberships, with which 
you can, not only perform all these tasks, but also manage all the associated settings. 
Getting Started
In order to manage members, you should first log into the site as the administrator, 
and select the link titled Control Panel ���������������������������������������
located on the top navigation bar. The 
Community Server Dashboard page ����������������������������������������������
will be displayed. This permission/ability to 
manage members can be delegated to other users later on and doesn't always require 
the administrator.

Managing your Community's Users
[ 188 ]
Select the link Manage membership, roles, and user settings located under the 
Membership section from the Dashboard page. The Site Administration page will 
be displayed with various options as shown below:
Searching
As you can see from the above screenshot, the search functionality is initially 
displayed by default. You can search for members using different criteria such as 
their role or status. You can also refine the search using username, email address, 
number of posts, date of joining, and date on which the user was active on the site. 
Clicking the Search button without entering any options displays a page populated 
with all the registered users of your site as shown in the screenshot on the next page:

Chapter 7
[ 189 ]
As your site grows, the number of users will increase. You can choose how many 
users should be displayed on the search results page by selecting the required 
option from the Items per page drop-down box, which is highlighted in the 
above screenshot. 
You can also perform a search by selecting the required dates from the Filter By Date 
panel. You can either choose the date of creation of a post, or the date on which 
the last post was submitted on the site. First, you need to pick the relevant option 
from the Date Created drop-down box. Initially, the text fields are disabled. As 
soon as you select an option such as On, After, or Before from the relevant 
drop-down boxes, the Calendar control will be activated as shown in the 
screenshot shown below:
Navigating Search Pages
As discussed above, the maximum number of entries that will be displayed on the 
member search results page is 20. Naturally, all the items from the 21st record will be 
displayed on the second page. The Member Search Results page includes 

Managing your Community's Users
[ 190 ]
a navigation bar at the bottom of the page as shown in the following screenshot. 
It will help you to swap between pages. You can either move forward or move 
backwards depending upon your requirements.
As you can see the above search result contains only one page, as we don't have 
more than 20 users. You can either use the scroll bar or the buttons with black 
colors to navigate between pages provided if you have more than 20 records in the 
search results.
When you drag the scroll bar the page number will be displayed. As soon as you 
stop scrolling, Community Server displays a screen titled Loading and after a while 
the desired page automatically appears on the screen.
Examining Quick Lists Options
The Find People page displays a list of four link options under the title Quick Lists 
as shown in the following screenshot:
Let us now examine each one of the link options in detail:
Top Contributors
Community Server displays a list of all registered users who have contributed posts 
on the site. This option will help you to track those users who make use of your site 
very often and also to reward them accordingly. By default, the page displays a list 
of all registered members on the site in descending order of their number of posts:

Chapter 7
[ 191 ]
Visitors in the Last 24 Hours
This option enables you to retrieve the username and other associated details 
of all those users who visited your site in the past 24 hours as shown in the 
following screenshot:
As you can see, the grid displays the username of the site administrator. This means 
that other registered users have not logged into the site in the last 24 hours. 
Recent Registrations
This option will display a list of all those users who registered recently on the site. In 
order to verify this, let us now log out as administrator and register on the site with 
a new username. After the successful creation of the users login as an administrator 
and click the link titled Recent Registrations from the Quick Lists panel. T���
he 
grid at the bottom displays the details of the user who registered on the site after 
October 29, 2006�:

Managing your Community's Users
[ 192 ]
Users Awaiting Approval
This option will display a list of all those users who registered on the site but require 
to be approved by the administrator. We have not enabled moderation of new 
registrations and hence if we click on the link no results will be displayed on the 
search results page. 
Let us now examine how to moderate a new user registration. Locate the link titled 
New Registration Settings located under the Memberships panel. Select Admin 
Approval from the option titled Account Activation and click the Save button 
located at the bottom of the page.
Refer to the Managing Registration Settings section for a 
detailed coverage of all the settings included in the New 
Registration Settings page. 
After this, when a user registers on the site, the site administrator must approve 
the registration. We will now proceed to register a new user and examine 
the functionality. As soon as you submit the form after entering the required 
information, the following page will be displayed:

Chapter 7
[ 193 ]
In order to approve the registered user, you need to log in as an administrator and 
navigate to the Control Panel. Click the link located on the Membership panel and 
select Users Awaiting Approval from the Quick Lists section. The grid displays the 
details of the user who registered just now as shown below:
Select the username from the above screenshot and then select the Approved option 
and click the Save Changes button to approve the user.
As soon as the user is approved, an email confirming registration will be sent to 
the user.
You will be able to view the details of the approved user if you navigate to the 
Recent Registrations page as discussed in the previous section as shown below:
Selecting the Actions button will display a pop-up menu with which you can modify 
the password of the user, and add or remove roles. As an administrator, you can 
even delete a user by selecting the relevant option from the pop-up menu. 

Managing your Community's Users
[ 194 ]
Browsing All Members
As soon as you click on the link titled Browse People located under the Membership 
panel, a list of all registered members will be displayed as we have seen previously 
in this chapter. We have already discussed the various options on the page in the 
previous section. In this section, we will examine some of the hidden options on the 
page. As noted earlier, a pop-up menu will be displayed when you click the button 
captioned Actions as shown in the screenshot:
The above screenshot shows four options which enable you to modify the username 
and password of the specific user, add/remove roles, and also delete the user. Let us 
examine each of these options in detail.
Modifying the Username
In order to modify the username of a member, you should select the Change 
Username option from the pop-up menu shown in the previous screenshot. This 
brings up the following dialog box:
As you can see we have entered a new username in the Desired UserName field. As 
soon as you click the Change UserName button, the new username will be saved. 

Chapter 7
[ 195 ]
The updated username will appear on the grid (see screenshot) only if you refresh 
the page or click the Browse People link from the navigation panel.
Changing Passwords
In order to modify the password of a member, you should select the Reset/Change 
Password menu item from the pop-up menu. A dialog box will be displayed where 
you should specify the new password for the specific member. ��������������������
You need to specify 
a new password twice and submit the form by clicking the Change Password 
button. The password will be immediately saved and you will be returned to the 
search page.
Adding and Removing Roles
The core building block of Community Server is roles. They denote the permissions 
or rights granted by the site administrator to the specific member to manage the site. 
For instance, if you need to give a member the rights to manage the gallery then you 
should assign the role of GalleryAdministrator to the relevant member. 
In order to add or remove roles for a specific user, you need to click the menu item 
Add/Remove Roles from the pop-up menu. The User Roles dialog will be displayed 
as shown overleaf:

Managing your Community's Users
[ 196 ]
You can specify roles for the above user by selecting them from the Available roles 
list box and by using the arrow buttons on the middle of the dialog. The selected 
role(s) will be added to the list box on the right-hand side. 
You can select multiple roles by holding down the Ctrl key 
during the selection process.
For example, we will now examine how to give the role of Moderator to the selected 
user. Select Moderator from the Available Roles list box and click the first arrow (>). 
The selected role will be immediately added to the list box on the right-hand side 
(see the screenshot) and will be saved upon clicking the Save button.

Chapter 7
[ 197 ]
We have now given the status of Moderator to a member with the username 
anand_n_mvp. In the same way, you can specify roles for each user depending upon 
the requirements. 
The second arrow (<) from the top enables you to remove 
the selected role for the member. While the third arrow 
(>>) enables you to grant all the roles shown on the 
Available Roles section to the member irrespective of 
the selection, the fourth arrow (<<) removes all the roles 
granted to the member even if you haven't selected any 
roles from the list box. 
Deleting Users
As an administrator, you can delete a user from the site. This should be done as a 
last resort when the user performs any unacceptable act such as posting of unwanted 
messages or pictures. In order to delete the user, select the Delete User menu item 
from the pop-up menu. A dialog box will be displayed as shown below:
You should either assign all the existing content to another user on the site or to the 
anonymous user. The user will be then deleted from the system as soon as you click 
the Delete User button from the pop-up dialog box. The grid will be updated only if 
you either refresh the page or click the Find People link from the navigation panel. 
Creating a New Account
As an administrator, you can create a new member from within the Membership 
section inside the Control Panel. This feature will be useful if you would like to 
create a new member internally and want to restrict direct registration by members 
from the site. 

Managing your Community's Users
[ 198 ]
In order to create an account for a member, select the Create New Account link 
located under the Membership section, enter the required information, and click the 
Create User button located at the bottom of the page. 
As soon as you submit the page, the relevant username will be created if it doesn't 
exist and the Find People page will be displayed with a confirmation that the 
specified user has been successfully created. 
Managing Roles
You can globally manage the roles assigned to the various members with the help of 
the Manage All Roles link located under the Membership section. 
You can, not only add new roles, but also view a list of members who have 
been allocated a specific role. We will now examine for which users the site 
administrator has allocated Moderator status. Select the View Members button from 
the Moderator ����
row.

Chapter 7
[ 199 ]
As you can see from the above screenshot, the Role drop-down box displays the 
name of the role, which is moderator. There are currently two members who are 
assigned the status of moderator. In the similar way, you can display a list of all 
members who have been allocated various roles. 
You can create new role by clicking the Add New Role button on top right-hand side 
of the Manage All Roles page. You need to enter the required information such as 
the Name and Description of the role in the Edit Role pop-up dialog box. You can 
also upload an icon, which will be displayed along with the posts (see screenshot 
below) submitted by the relevant member. As soon as you click on the Save button, 
the relevant role will be added to the system. Community Server assigns a unique ID 
for each role, which you can see by selecting the relevant role.

Managing your Community's Users
[ 200 ]
In order to associate an icon with an existing role, you 
should click the role and upload the icon by browsing for 
the image that has to be associated with the role. 
Managing Registration Settings
You can manage registration-related settings by selecting the link titled New 
Registration Settings located under the Membership section. With the help of the 
settings on the page, you can manage and control registration-related activities. Let 
us examine the usage of each of these settings in detail:
Allow Login
If this is disabled, only administrators will be able to log in to the site. This setting is 
enabled by default and hence all users can log in.
Allow Banned Users to Login
With the help of this option, you can control the activities of users who are banned in 
your site. By default, banned users are not able to log in to the site and they will view 
the following message when they attempt to log in to the site.
If banned users are allowed to log in to the site then they will not notice any 
considerable difference until they begin to post a blog or thread. They will view a 
message as shown below when they attempt to submit a post
Allow New User Registration
If this is disabled, or set to No, then new users can not register on the site. They will 
view a message as shown in the following screenshot, when they attempt to register 

Chapter 7
[ 201 ]
on the site by selecting the Join link from the top of the site. This setting is enabled 
by default and hence users can register on the site at any time.
Show Contact Checkboxes
If this is enabled, users will see two settings, Allow this site to contact me and Allow 
this site's partners to contact me, at the bottom of the Site Options tab when editing 
their profile. Your users will also see these two options on the registration form page 
when they signup on the site by clicking the Join link located on the top of the site. 
These settings are disabled by default. Your users will receive communications from 
the site and its partners depending upon these settings. 
New User Moderation Level
With the help of this option administrators can moderate new posts made by the 
users. If you select the option User is Moderated the site administrator should 
approve the post submitted by the relevant user before publishing it on the site. 
Username Regular Expression Pattern
This setting provides a regular expression pattern based on which usernames 
are created. Community Server rejects the registration of those users who do not 
follow the specified pattern while entering usernames. The default pattern is 
[a-zA-Z]+[^\<\>]* and it implies that a string should begin with at least one letter 
(a-z of upper or lower case) followed by any characters other than < or >.
Username Minimum Length
With the help of this setting, you can specify the minimum length that should be 
entered for usernames. The default value is 3. The registration setting will not accept 
a username if it is less than 3 characters and will display an error message that 
prompts the user to use a username with more than 3 characters. 
Username Maximum Length
With the help of this setting, you can specify the maximum length that should be 
entered for usernames. The default value is 64. The registration setting will not 
accept a username if it is more than 64 characters and will display an error message 
that prompts the user to use a username with less than 64 characters.

Managing your Community's Users
[ 202 ]
Account Activation
This setting specifies how an account or a new registration should be activated. 
If Automatic is selected then Community Server will immediately approve the 
registration. If Admin Approval is selected then an administrator should approve 
the registration before the relevant user can work on the site. We have already 
discussed this setting previously in this chapter.
Password Recovery 
Users often forget the password that they either supplied during registration or 
modified at a later stage. This handy setting specifies the manner in which the 
password should be recovered. There are two different ways by which a user can 
recover the password. They are Reset and Link.
If Reset is selected, Community Server will automatically recover the password if 
the username matches with the one in the database. The recovered password will be 
emailed to the user. On the other hand, if the value Link is selected then the specific 
user will receive an email with a link. The password will be restored upon clicking 
the link and entering a new password twice.
Password Regular Expression Pattern
This setting provides a regular expression pattern based on which passwords are 
created and stored. Community Server rejects the registration of those users who do 
not follow the specified pattern while entering their password. The default pattern is 
(.*) and it implies that you can supply any string as your password. But depending 
on the regular expression (regex) options the newline character may not be matched. 
There are no hardcore restrictions for passwords as it is ultimately the choice of users 
to protect themselves from hackers. 
You will find more about regular expressions at: 
http://www.regular-expressions.info/ 
Managing Account Profile Settings
You can manage the profile-related settings of users by selecting the link titled 
Global Account Profile Settings located under the Membership section. With 
the help of the options on the page, you can manage signatures, gender, and 
theme-related settings. Let us examine the usage of each of these settings in detail:

Chapter 7
[ 203 ]
Allow Signatures
If this is disabled then your users will not be able to add or edit signatures in their 
profile. This feature will not be available until you enable it from the administrator 
Control Panel. By default this setting is enabled. It is not a good idea to disable this 
feature as users may include signatures along with the posts. 
A signature mainly includes the name, designation, and 
relevant URLs of the web sites managed by users. It can 
also contain images.
Enable Signatures
If this is enabled, signatures are displayed at the bottom of each post as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Signature Maximum Length
This setting enables you to specify the maximum number of characters that is 
allowed for signatures. The default value is 256. You can increase this limit if you 
wish but it will be optimum if it is maintained below 500 characters. 
Allow Gender
With the help of this setting, administrators can enable the gender functionality 
on the site. This feature is mainly used in forums. The relevant gender icon will be 
displayed along with all posts made by that user. 
After enabling the setting, click on the username link located on the top of the site 
and navigate to the tab titled About. Select a value from the option titled Gender and 
click the Save Changes button.

Managing your Community's Users
[ 204 ]
In order to view the gender icon, browse to any of the posts on the forum. You can 
view the gender icon on the left side of each post. �������������������������������
In order to view an icon for a 
female user you need to modify the profile accordingly by setting the value of the 
Gender property to female. 
Enable User Theme Selection
If this is enabled, users can select an appropriate theme that overrides the default 
theme for their site. 
Require Authentication for Profile Viewing 
If this is enabled anonymous users cannot view the profile of other registered users 
without logging into the site. This option will force them to log in if they are not 
logged in. 
Member List Settings
You can manage member-related settings such as displaying the member list, and the 
total number of members that should be displayed per page by clicking the Member 
List Settings link located under the Membership section. Let us examine each of the 
options in detail:
Display Member List
If this is enabled, users can view a list of all members registered on the site. This 
setting is enabled by default.
Enable Advanced Member Searching
If this is enabled, users can make use of symbols for performing complex searches on 
the site. Some of the popular symbols used while searching are AND, OR, and +.
Enable Audit Counters
If this is enabled, audit counters are displayed as a new column in the list members. 
Users can view the counter when they navigate the members page. This setting will 
work only if Display Member List option has been enabled by the administrator. 

Chapter 7
[ 205 ]
Members per Page
With the help of this option, you can specify the total number of members that 
should be displayed per page when a user performs a search operation. By default 
the value is 20. 
Managing Cookie and Anonymous 
Settings
You can manage cookie and anonymous user-related settings by selecting the link 
titled Cookie and Anonymous Settings located under the Membership section. Let 
us examine each of the settings in detail:
Roles Cookie Enabled
Community Server generates an HTTP cookie that is used to store an encrypted 
string containing user roles. This setting is enabled by default.
Track Anonymous Users
With the help of this setting, you can track the Internet Protocol (IP) address of 
anonymous users. Anonymous users are those users who are not signed into the site. 
As an administrator you need to keep a strict watch on these users so that you can 
check whether they are abusing the forum. Community Server records the IP address 
of each anonymous user, with which you can track their destination. 
Roles Cookie Name
This setting enables you to specify a name for the cookie that is used to store 
user roles. As noted earlier, the management of members is done using roles and 
they are stored internally on the user's system under the default name, which 
is CSRoles. 
Roles Cookie Expiration
This setting specifies the time limit after which the roles cookie will expire after its 
initiation. The default value is 20 minutes.

Managing your Community's Users
[ 206 ]
Anonymous Cookie Name
You can specify a name for the cookie that is used for anonymous users. The default 
name is CSAnonymous.
Anonymous Cookie Expiration
This setting specifies the time limit after which the cookie is set for anonymous users 
will expire after its initiation. The default value is 20 minutes.
Cookie Domain
You can specify the part of a domain name such as domainname.com that 
will be used for storing the cookie. The default value for this setting is localhost. 
The actual domain name for the cookie in a local environment will be 
Cookie:System-Name@localhost/. 
The above-mentioned name can be accessed by navigating to the Tools | Internet 
Options menu of your browser. We assume that you are using Internet Explorer. 
You need to click the Settings button and you will see the Settings dialog box. Click 
the View Files button to view the generated cookies. You will need to delete all 
existing cookies and browse the site from the beginning to see the real effect behind 
the generation of cookies. 
Anonymous User Online Window
You can set the time interval for tracking the total number of anonymous users 
who are accessing the site using this setting. The default value is �����������������
30 ���������������
 minutes. This 
means that Community Server will automatically display the usernames of those 
anonymous users who accessed the site in the last 30 minutes. 
Managing Avatar Settings
You can manage avatar-related settings by selecting the Global Avatar Settings link 
located under the Membership section. In forum parlance, an avatar means any 
graphical image that a user might use to identify them, generally a photograph or 
logo. It uniquely identifies your line of business. For instance, if you are the CEO of 
a web hosting company then you can display a logo of your company so that users 
can recognize you from your firm. Moreover, you can also showcase your logo. 
For example, if you are a Microsoft MVP then you can display any one of the logos 
supplied by Microsoft as your avatar as shown next:

Chapter 7
[ 207 ]
Enable Avatars
If this is enabled, your users can make use of the avatar feature and can display their 
identity as described in the previous section. This setting will work only if it has been 
enabled by the user from the Avatar tab on their profile (see the screenshot below). 
The users will be required to upload the image that will be displayed as their avatar 
along with their posts. They can modify the avatar by simply browsing for the image 
and selecting the Update button.
Enable Remote Avatars
If this is enabled, your users can make use of a remote image as their avatar instead of 
browsing for an image from their local hard drive. The images will be preferably hosted 
on an external website or on the same website depending upon the circumstances. This 
setting is disabled by default for both site administrator and users and will be available 
for registered users only if it has been enabled by the administrator.
Once the administrator has enabled remote avatars, users can specify the URL in the 
Avatar URL field from the profile page as shown below:

Managing your Community's Users
[ 208 ]
Avatar Dimensions
This setting enables you to specify the dimension with which the avatar will be 
displayed on the site. By default, the value of this setting is ��������������������
80x80���������������
. However, you 
can modify the values according to your requirements. 
Summary
Effective management of members is a must for any site serving the community. This 
statement is absolutely true for Community Server as it provides a robust mechanism 
for searching and managing members for administrators and moderators. This 
chapter examined all the settings for the effective management of your members 
in addition to the management of avatars. The next chapter will examine about the 
various options available for customizing Community Server. 

Customizing 
Community Server
In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to modify the look and feel of your site 
with the help of themes. You will also learn how to customize themes with the help 
of Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files. We will go one step further ahead and examine 
the implementation of the FreeTextBoxWrapper add‑on and calendar module into 
Community Server site. Towards the end of the chapter, you will learn how to create 
custom links on the navigation bar. 
Customizing the Home Page
In order to customize the home page, you should first log in as a user with site 
administration privileges. Firstly, we will examine how to modify the header area, 
which includes the headings and logo. We will also examine how to modify the 
default content on the home page.
Modifying Headings and Logos
You can modify the top heading and its sub-heading by clicking on the respective 
content and entering new text. However, you can also modify them by clicking 
the Site Name & Description link located inside the Settings panel on the Site 
Administration page.
The site logo can be modified by replacing the image titled title.gif located 
under the Themes\default\images\Common folder with a new image. We would 
suggest you to create a new image and give its name as title.gif. You can then 
rename the original image with any other name and place the new image inside the 
above-mentioned folder. You need to refresh the site for the new logo to appear on 
the site.

Customizing Community Server
[ 210 ]
Editing Content
By default, a welcome message is displayed along with a short introduction about 
Community Server on the home page of the site. The page also features images 
of showcased sites and also some relevant links for obtaining documentation and 
support. In order to modify this content, you just need to place your mouse cursor 
over it and double-click on it. As soon as you double-click, a text editor opens up 
populated with the home page content. You can then format the content by inserting 
images, hyperlinks, and emoticons, and using the various options available in the 
editor. Finally, click on the Save Changes button to save and return to the home 
page. Your new content will automatically appear on the home page.
Modifying the Theme of your Site
You can change the look and feel of your site with the help of various themes 
included with Community Server. Each theme consists of several individual skin 
files, which consist of related user controls and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With 
the release of Community Server 2.1, themes are controlled by style sheet rather than 
user controls as was the case in previous versions. We will discuss how to modify 
themes using CSS files in the Modifying Themes section��. 
In this section, we will examine how to modify the appearance of your site using the 
themes included with Community Server. By default, Community Server includes 
three themes, which you can use to change the look and feel of your site. 
You can separately download and install themes available 
either at the official site at http://communityserver.org/
files/folders/themes_and_skins/default.aspx or 
from third‑party vendors and developers. You should only 
install those themes that are designed for Community Server 2.1. 
However, you can convert themes meant for Community 
Server 2.0 and implement them for your Community 
Server 2.1 installation by following the steps mentioned at 
http://getben.com/archive/2006/08/08/
Updating-CS2.0-Themes-for-CS2.1.aspx.
In order to modify the theme for the whole site, click on the username link at the 
top of the home page and select the Site Options tab. Locate the Theme drop-down 
list and change its value either to basic blue or alternate1. For the purpose of our 
discussion we will modify its value to basic blue and you will be able to view the 
modified site immediately after clicking the Save Changes button. The following 
screenshot shows the blogs home page decorated with the basic blue theme.

Chapter 8
[ 211 ]
If you have installed any third-party themes then they will also be populated inside 
the Theme drop-down list.
Modifying the Theme of your Blog
Let us now examine how to modify the appearance of blogs by using various themes. 
As explained in ���������
Chapter 3 Working with Blogs, you can manage all the blogs on the 
site as an Administrator. For this purpose, click the Control Panel link and select the 
My Blogs link. You will view the Blog Management page�����������
. Pull the Global Settings 
panel and select the Change How My Blog Looks link located under it. You can 
modify the appearance of your blog by selecting the appropriate theme from the 
Theme drop-down box. As soon as you select a theme, its corresponding preview 
will be displayed as shown in the following screenshot, so that you can choose 
another if it doesn't suit your needs. 

Customizing Community Server
[ 212 ]
The appearance of your blog will be changed as soon as you click the Save button at 
the bottom of the Blog Management page. 
As an Administrator, you can switch between blogs by clicking the Select Blog to 
Manage button and then selecting the relevant link from the AppKey column. You 
will view the Blog Management page for the selected blog and you can modify its 
theme as explained earlier. 
As an Administrator, you can globally modify the theme 
for all blogs on the site by selecting the appropriate theme 
from the Default Theme drop-down list from the Default 
Presentation link located under the Blogs section inside the Site 
Administration page 
Members can change the theme for their blogs by selecting the My Blog 
Dashboard page located under the Common Tasks section from the home page of 
their respective blogs. In order to access this link, members should browse their 
blog by using the actual Uniform Resource Locator (URL) such as 
http://localhost/cs21/blogs/csbook/default.aspx. 
Modifying Themes
In the previous sections, you have learned how to modify the look and feel of 
your site using themes. In this section, we will examine how to modify the themes 
included with Community Server. 
Each theme consists of several folders, namely images, Masters, Skins, and style. 
The style folder contains several Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files, which you need 
to modify in order to change the appearance of the active theme. For instance, in 
order to change the background ����������������������������������������������������
color�����������������������������������������������
, you should modify the relevant property from 
the appropriate Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file.

Chapter 8
[ 213 ]
In order to modify the appearance of the home page, you need to open the Common.
css file located inside Style folder of the corresponding theme and update the 
relevant property with the correct value. 
For instance, if you would like to change the background �������������������������
color ��������������������
 for your site, you 
need to open the Common.css �������������������
file located under Themes\default\style folder and 
modify the background-color property located under the body, html section by 
supplying the appropriate ��������������������������
color ���������������������
 code as shown below:
body, html
{
	
margin: 0px;
	
padding: 0px;
	
color: #000000;
	
font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica;
 
background-color: #999966;
}
You can obtain the correct color codes for each specific color 
from http://html-color-codes.com/.
We assume that you are using the theme named default. In the same way, you can 
modify the background color of other themes by opening the CSS file located inside 
the style folder of the corresponding theme. 
You can also modify the background color of the page header and other adjoining 
areas by supplying the appropriate value for the background-color property 
located in the #Common class as shown below:
#Common
{
	
background-color: #3399CC;
	
border-top: solid 6px #bbde79;
}
If you need to change the appearance of the forum home page for the theme 
named default, then you should open the forum.css ��������������������
file located in the 
Themes\default\style folder. 

Customizing Community Server
[ 214 ]
Modifying Themes Dynamically
Site Administrators will have access to the file system and hence they can directly 
modify the CSS files as discussed above. However, registered users do not have FTP 
access and hence cannot modify the theme for their blog. For the benefit of users, 
Community Server includes a feature to provide the required style tags from within 
the Dashboard. 
In order to perform this task, click the Control Panel link from the home page and 
select the My Blogs link from the Blog Management page. Click the Change H���
ow 
M������������
y Blog Looks link located in the Global Settings section, select the CSS Overrides 
tab and supply the appropriate code for the corresponding style ID as shown below:
#Common
{
   background-color: yellow;
}
We have now modified the color of the header and other adjoining areas of the 
current blog's home page. You can view the output by clicking the link beside the 
Current Blog section from the Blog Management page. As you can see, we have 
modified the theme without opening any CSS files. 
Working with Add-ons
You can further enhance the working of your site with the help of ����������������
add-on ����������
 packages 
that are available from the official website (http://www.communityserver.org ) of 
Community Server. You should note that a majority of these packages are associated 
with the previous versions of Community Server and you should install only those 
packages that are developed for Community Server 2.1. 
The installation instructions are provided along with each add-on package and 
you should refer to them to cross‑check for compatibility of the add-on with the 
Community Server version you are using. You should always take a backup of all the 
existing files before installing any add-on packages so that you can restore the site if 
there is any problem during the installation process.

Chapter 8
[ 215 ]
You can integrate powerful functionalities such as windows, 
passport, forms, and cookie authentication on your site. In 
addition to these, you can also implement features such as 
enterprise search, news gateway, and FTP server on your 
site using the relevant add-on packages. It is beyond the 
scope of this chapter to examine each one of these packages. 
You will find more information regarding the steps to 
be followed to work with these add-on packages at:
http://docs.communityserver.org/ 
Add‑on packages enhance a site with advanced functionalities such as adding an 
advanced textbox editor, Google Sitemap, and much more. As of writing this book, 
the Downloads section lists only two add‑on packages for Community Server 2.1. 
The one that is commonly used is a textbox editor called FreeTextBoxWrapper. It 
is a robust, powerful, and free editor, which contains many features that are not 
available with the editors shipped with Community Server. Let us discuss about the 
installation and usage of FreeTextBoxWrapper ����������������
control add-on. 
Using FreeTextBoxWrapper Control
Community Server contains three different content editors that let you post content 
to your site namely: Plain Text, Standard, and Enhanced. But these editors don't 
provide advanced functionalities such as formatting source code, managing 
images, etc. These features are provided by a third‑party content editor called 
FreeTextBoxWrapper������
. The FreeTextBoxWrapper content editor is developed by 
George J. Capnias and is available for download at http://communityserver.org/
files/folders/add-ons/default.aspx. 
In order to download the control, you need to log in as a member and navigate to the 
Downloads section by clicking its link from the top navigation bar. Expand the tree 
titled Community Downloads ���������������
and select the Add-on folder as shown below:

Customizing Community Server
[ 216 ]
As soon as you click the link, you will see a list of all add-on files on the right-
hand side of the page. You have to locate the link titled FreeTextBoxWrapper for 
Community Server v2.1 series. After locating the link, you need to select it and click 
the Download button at the top of the page to download the required file in ZIP 
format. The extracted file consists of different folders meant for various builds of 
Community Server. Each folder contains the required Dynamic Link Library (DLL) 
files for both .NET 1.1 and 2.0.
Installing the FreeTextBoxWrapper Control
Before beginning to work with the control, you should install it properly. Firstly, 
you should find out the version of Community Server you have installed. For 
this purpose, click the Control Panel link and scroll down to the bottom of the 
Dashboard page. You will find the version number on the right-hand side of the 
page (2.1.60809.935, in our case). 
As noted earlier, the textbox control ships with DLL files for the various builds of 
Community Server 2.1. You should use the files available inside the v1.1.4322 
folder located inside the 2.1.60809.935 folder. If you have installed Community 
Server on .NET Framework 2.0 then you should use the files inside the folder 
v2.0.50727. Follow the steps given below to install FreeTextBoxWrapper control:
1.	 Copy the DLL files located inside the folder mentioned above and paste them 
to the bin folder located inside your Community Server site. 
2.	 Copy the FreeTextBox3 folder and the contents of the Themes folder from 
the unzipped folder, CommunityServer[1].FreetextBoxWrapper.2006-08-
15, and paste them to the root of your Community Server site.
3.	 Finally, open the CommunityServer.txt file and copy the provided code 
from the <editors> section to the <editors> section of CommunityServer.
config file located in the root directory of your Community Server site. 
The <editors> section should finally appear as shown in the listing given below:
<editors>
  <editor name="FreeTextBox Standard" skinName="Skin-Editor-FTB.ascx"
  default="true" />
  <editor name="FreeTextBox Enhanced" skinName="Skin-Editor-
  FTBEnhanced.ascx" />
  <editor name="Plain Text" skinName="Skin-Editor-PlainText.ascx" />
  <editor name="Standard" skinName="Skin-Editor-Standard.ascx"/>
  <editor name="Enhanced" skinName="Skin-Editor-Enhanced.ascx" />
</editors>

Chapter 8
[ 217 ]
You have successfully installed the FreeTextBoxWrapper control. In order to work 
with the editor, you should reload the site and modify the value of the Content 
Editor drop-down list located inside the Site Options tab from the profile page.
In order to access the profile page, click the username link at the 
top of the site. 
As you can see, the FreeTextBox control includes two different options: FreeTextBox 
Standard and FreeTextBox Enhanced. The Enhanced editor provides features such 
as code formatting and an image gallery, which are not available with the Standard 
editor. For the purpose of our discussion, we will select the FreeTextBox Enhanced 
option and click the Save Changes button located at the bottom of the page.  
You have now chosen to use FreeTextBox Enhanced as your editor for the whole 
site. Hence, you can see the editor if you try to submit a post to your blog or forums, 
or in any other location where user input is required. 
Let us now examine some of the features of the editor by submitting a post to the 
ASP.NET 2.0 forum, which we created earlier. For this purpose, click the Forums 
link, select the relevant forum from the home page and click the Write a New Post 
button. You will see a blank page powered with a rich toolbar as shown below:
As you can see from the above screenshot, the editor includes more functionalities 
than the other editors included within Community Server. 
You can insert the current time by using the yellow color clock icon. It is now 
possible to insert symbols by using the relevant options from the Symbols 
drop-down list. You can also insert images from the gallery included within the 
editor. Moreover, you can also insert content from the file and photo galleries by 
using the Select Content icon from the editor toolbar. 
Let us now examine how to insert and format a sample C# code snippet. Firstly, 
select the Insert Code Snippet icon and enter or paste the required code in the 
pop-up window as shown in the screenshot in the next page.

Customizing Community Server
[ 218 ]
As you can see from the above screenshot, we have enabled the Include Line 
Numbers checkbox. This feature inserts numbers on each line so that you can 
reference them while discussing the code. The final output of our sample code 
snippet will appear as shown in the screenshot opposite.

Chapter 8
[ 219 ]
You will observe that the code has been formatted nicely with different colors and 
line numbers. Similarly, you can format code snippets of other languages such as 
VB.NET, J#, T-SQL, and ASP.NET. You can even format Microsoft Intermediate 
Language (MSIL) and JavaScript code.
Another interesting feature of the FreeTextBox control is that it has an enhanced 
emoticon viewer as shown overleaf.

Customizing Community Server
[ 220 ]
The development of add-ons is a continuous process. More and more new add-on 
packages will be developed either by Telligent or by other developers and will be 
added to the Downloads section. Hence, you should check the Downloads area 
frequently for any updates regarding add-on packages. 
Working with Modules
Modules are plug‑ins used to activate advanced features such as tagging events 
on the calendar, display of videos, and much more. You will find a list of available 
modules on the Downloads page at the official website of Community Server. 
In order to download the modules, you need to log in as a member at 
http://www.communityserver.org and navigate to the Downloads section by 
clicking its link from the top navigation bar. Expand the tree titled Community 
Downloads and select the CSModules folder�.
In this chapter, we will discuss the implementation and usage of the DanBartels.
CS.Calendar module. The main function of this module is that it lets you tag your 
posts so that their titles show on a community calendar for your site. This module 
is extremely useful if you plan to host several meetings and events either for your 
company or for your user group. 
An add‑on is a business rule or other compiled code that 
adds specific functionality; for example the single sign‑on 
libraries are 'add‑ons'. A module is a business rule or other 
compiled code that handles events raised by Community Server 
and implements the base class or interface derived from a 
Community Server module.

Chapter 8
[ 221 ]
Firstly, download the DanBartels.CS.Calendar module in ZIP format by locating 
the DanBartels.CS.Calendar module. After extracting the file follow the steps given 
below to integrate the module into your site.
1.	 Add the contents of the bin, Calendar, Themes, and Utility folders into the 
root of your Community Server site. 
2.	 Add the contents of the communityserver.merge.config file to the 
communityserver.config file located inside the root of your Community 
Server site. 
3.	 Add the contents of the SiteUrls.merge.config file to the SiteUrls.
config file located inside the root of your Community Server site.
We would suggest you to add the following tag as a final item inside the 
<navigation> element so that the relevant link will be placed at the end of the other 
links on the navigation bar. 
<link name="calendar" resourceUrl="calendarhome" text="Calendar" />
Once you finish the above mentioned steps, you need to update the changes in the 
web.config file by opening it using Notepad and saving the file. You will notice that 
a new module named Calendar has been added on the navigation bar immediately 
after refreshing the site as shown below:
We have successfully integrated the Calendar module inside Community Server. 
The next step is to examine the usage of the module. In order to perform this task, 
you need to simply add the tag similar to [cal]10-20-2006[/cal] anywhere in 
the body of the editor while writing a post. The resulting link will appear on the 
calendar as shown in the screenshot below:

Customizing Community Server
[ 222 ]
As you can observe from the above screenshot, a new link has been added with the 
relevant title against the date October 20, 2006 and clicking on it will take you to 
the relevant post on the site. Hence, you can infer that the Trivandrum .NET User 
Group Meeting is scheduled to be held on that date. In the same way, you can add 
other events and each one of them will appear on the calendar according to their date 
of occurrence.
Creating Custom Links
You can create your own links on the navigation bar by simply inserting the code as 
given below inside the <navigation> element �������
in ����
the SiteUrls.config file located 
at the root of your Community Server site. 
<link name="Microsoft" navigateUrl="http://www.microsoft.com/" 
text="Microsoft" />
<link name="Learnxpress" navigateUrl="http://www.learnxpress.com/" 
text="Learnxpress" />
After saving the� SiteUrls.config �����������������������������
file, open and then save the web.config file and 
navigate to your site. You will see two links captioned Microsoft and Learnxpress as 
shown below:
Clicking on these links will enable you to navigate to the websites pointed to by their 
navigateUrl ���������
property.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the different ways in which you can customize 
the appearance of your Community Server site. We have also shown you the 
different ways its which you can modify the appearance of your site and blog using 
themes including their customization aspects. Towards the end of the chapter, you 
learned about the implementation and usage of the FreeTextBoxWrapper add-on 
and calendar module. It is up to you to make use of all the available options for 
customizing Community Server so that you can effectively reap the rich benefits of 
this application.

Working with Settings 
In the previous chapter, you learned how to modify the look and feel of your site in 
various ways. In this chapter, we will explore the important settings that are used for 
managing a Community Server site. You will also learn how to modify the contact 
information, date, time, and email-related settings. We will also examine how to 
control the activities of the users registered on the site by tracking their IP addresses. 
Overview
The Settings section inside the Site Administration page contains several options for 
managing content, applications, contact information, date, time, and much more. It is 
important for you as an administrator to understand the working of each and every 
setting so that you can employ them as and when required. You, as a����������������
n administrator 
would ideally use most of these settings, hence should surely be familiar with all of 
them. ����������������������������������������������������������������������������
Let us examine each one of the options included under the section in detail.
Managing General Site Settings
In order to enable advanced functionalities such as ink, site URL, EULA graphic, and 
other related settings, you should click the General Site Settings link located under 
the Settings section. The changes made to these settings will affect the whole site 
globally. They are also known as site-wide settings. Let us examine each one of these 
settings in detail.
Enable Ink

Time Zone
As an administrator, you can specify a Time zone using the setting. However, 
your users can override this setting by selecting a Time zone in the Site Options 
tab on the profile. The drop-down box shows a list of zones and you need to pick 
an option from it depending upon the time zone in which the SQL server holding 
the Community Server database is located. Community Server uses this setting to 
display time-related information on the site. 
Date Format
You can specify a format for the display of dates using this setting. The drop-down 
box shows a list of date formats as shown in the screenshot below and you need 
to pick an option from it depending upon your preferences; but you should note 
that the users can override this setting in their profile. Community Server uses this 
setting to format the display of date-related information on the blogs and forums for 
anonymous users. The default format is Day, Month Days Year.
Time Format
You can specify a format for the display of time on the site using this setting. The 
drop-down box shows a list of time formats as shown in the following screenshot, 
and you need to pick an option from it depending upon your preferences; but you 
should note that the users can override this setting in their profile. Community 
Server uses this setting to display time-related information on the blogs and forums. 
The default format is 12 hour single digit.
Any changes made here are immediately reflected on the site.

two months are displayed when a user performs a search query on the forum. 
If Show All is selected then all the threads are displayed on the search result page.
Managing Email Settings
You can manage email-related settings such as SMTP Server, SMTP login name, 
and SMTP password by selecting the Email Settings link����������������������
. Emails generated by 
Community Server can only be delivered only if these settings are correct. Let us 
examine each of these settings in detail.
Enable Email
If disabled, the email system will not function. Hence any feature that generates an 
email such as Forgot Password, Post Moderation, and Notification to registered users 
will not work until you enable the setting. 
Email Encoding
This setting specifies the default email encoding that will be used with all email 
messages. The default value is utf-8, and it also determines the character set. Some of 
the other possible values are us-ASCII, utf-7 or unicode. 

Chapter 9
[ 233 ]
UTF-8 stands for 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format. 
You will find more information at: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf-8 
Email Throttle
This setting specifies the maximum number of emails that can be sent at a time. 
The default setting is -1 and this means infinite. If you set the value to 10 then 
Community Server will only deliver 10 emails at a time.
SMTP Server
This setting denotes the name of your SMTP server. The default value is localhost for 
local systems. You need to specify the correct SMTP server name as supplied by your 
host or network administrator.
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and it is 
through this protocol emails are delivered to the recipients 
from the server. 
Use Windows Integrated Authentication
If this is enabled, Community Server uses Windows Integrated Authentication to log 
in to the SMTP server. Typically this is only used in a Windows domain environment 
where the application pool that Community Server is executing in is authenticating 
under a domain account and the same account has rights to the SMTP server.
SMTP Server Login Required
You need to enable this setting if your remote server requires you to give credentials 
to the SMTP server to send emails. Normally, username and password are supplied. 
If you are not sure about this setting then you need to contact either your hosting 
service provider or Internet Service Provider (ISP) to seek clarification. 
SMTP Server Login Name
You need to specify the login name of your SMTP server in this field. Typically, it 
will be your full email address in the format username@domain.com.

Working with Settings
[ 234 ]
SMTP Server Password
You need to specify the password of your SMTP server in this field. Typically, it will 
be the password of the email address that you supplied earlier. 
SMTP Port Number
You need to specify the port number of your SMTP server on this field. Normally, it 
will be 25. However, you should note that changing this value allows Community 
Server to use SMTP servers that have been configured to use a non standard port 
such as 26. Some hosting providers use 26 as SMTP port since many Internet Service 
Providers block the default port, which is 25. 
Tracking the IP Address
With the increase in cyber crime, you have to track the Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses of the posters to your Community Server site, thereby protecting your 
website against hackers and those who post unwanted submissions. Community 
Server provides a robust tracking mechanism by which you can know the original 
IP address of the user. This allows administrators to report the IP address of any 
unwanted activity to a law authority and allows licensed Community Server sites to 
ban the IP address. This feature is mainly used in forums. In order to manage the IP 
Address Tracking mechanism, you need to click the IP Address Tracking link. Let us 
now examine the options in detail.
Enable Tracking of Poster IP Address
If enabled, Community Server stores the IP address of each user who posts messages 
on the forum. The IP address is displayed on the bottom of each post on the forum as 
shown below:

Chapter 9
[ 235 ]
From the previous screenshot, you can infer that the post has been made from a local 
system with the default IP address 127.0.0.1 and not from a remote server. 
By default, the IP address is visible only for administrators.
Display Poster IP Address Publicly
If this is enabled, the IP address is visible to all users and will be displayed along 
with all the posts on the site. This setting is disabled by default, because the public 
display of the posters' IP address may be considered as an invasion of privacy. 
Hence, in most situations this setting will not be enabled.
Display Poster IP Address only to 
Administrators & Moderators
If this is enabled, the IP address of the poster will be visible only to the site 
Administrator and moderators. It will not be visible for an ordinary registered user. 
You should disable the previously discussed setting Display Poster IP Address 
Publicly in order to see the real working of this setting. If you enable that setting 
then the IP address will be displayed even if you are not an administrator or 
moderator. 
Summary
In this chapter, you have learned about the usage and management of the important 
aspects involved with posts, RSS, email, date, and time. Towards the end of this 
chapter, we have examined how to track the IP address of each poster, so that you 
can control the activities of your site in an effective manner. 
The next chapter will examine the generation of various reports using 
Community Server.


Working with Reports
We have so far examined the creation and management of various applications 
included with Community Server such as blogs, forums, galleries, reader, and roller 
and the different methods of customization. In this chapter, we will explore the 
usage of various kinds of reports included with Community Server. You will also 
learn about the creation of SQL jobs, required for generating various kinds of reports. 
Overview
Community Server includes a reporting functionality, which the Administrators 
can use to keep track of various activities on the site. You can generate and view 
various kinds of reports such as the exceptions report and the jobs report by clicking 
the relevant links located under the Reports navigation panel by selecting the 
Administration link on the Dashboard. Moreover, you can also generate reports 
pertaining to the various activities of the site, blogs, and forums by clicking the 
link titled Reporting from the dashboard. But this feature is only available in the 
standard (and above) versions of Community Server. 
You can purchase a license for Community Server from 
https://store.telligent.com/FamilyProducts.
aspx?id=1. You will learn about the steps required for the 
installation of a license in Chapter 11.
You should also note that some of the functionalities will work only in a live server 
environment as they need to access the relevant SQL job at a specific time. Let us 
examine the working of each one of these reports in detail: 

Working with Reports
[ 238 ]
Working with the Exceptions Report
In programming jargon, exceptions mean run-time errors. We often face a lot of 
problems when we run applications either locally or on a remote server. Community 
Server enables you to generate these kinds of errors in a report format sorted by 
the date of their occurrence. By default, a report of all exceptions is generated and 
displayed upon selecting the Exceptions Report link located under the Reports 
section from the Site Administration page as shown in the following screenshot:
You can access the Site Administration page by clicking 
the Control Panel link and selecting the Administration 
link from the Dashboard.
As you can observe from the above screenshot, the report shows the type of 
exception, the IP address from where it occurred, the date of occurrence, and the 
number of times the specified error occurred. It also displays the browser and 
operating system used when the exception occurred, its path, and the ������������
sequence of 
events that led to the exception �����������
 in detail.

Chapter 10
[ 239 ]
You should note that the reports will look different when 
you generate them using Community Server. 
You can either keep the reports or delete them from the system by clicking the 
Delete Selected button. You can also delete all the exceptions by clicking the Delete 
All button.
Filtering the Exceptions Report
You can generate reports based on the type of exception by selecting the relevant 
exception from the Exception Type dropdown. You can also filter the report based 
on the frequency of occurrence by selecting the relevant option from the That has 
dropdown. The report will be blank if no exceptions have occurred, matching the 
criteria that �������������������
you have selected. 
Working with the Jobs Report
Community Server runs certain jobs as services in the background, which are 
preconfigured by the application itself. You can view a detailed report of all jobs 
by selecting the Jobs Report link located under the Reports section from the Site 
Administration page as shown in the following screenshot:

Working with Reports
[ 240 ]
As you can see from the screenshot on the previous page, the report shows the type 
of job, whether it is enabled, the current status, and the relevant start, end, and 
success date and time. All these jobs will run every one minute as specified in the 
Interval setting under the Jobs Service Statistics section. A frequency of 15 minute 
for the jobs interval should only be used for testing purposes; you should change it 
in the communityserver.config file for production systems. 
Moreover, the report has been divided into two parts. While the first part displays 
those jobs that share a thread, the second part displays all the jobs that are running in 
their own thread as shown in the following screenshot:
Reporting with Community Server
With the release of Community Server 2.1, the activity reporting functionality 
has been separated and you can access it by clicking the Reporting link from the 
Dashboard. You will find three separate navigation panels titled Site, Blogs, and 
Forums on the left-hand side of the page. Each panel consists of several options with 
which you can access the relevant activity and other usage-related reports.
Generating Reports for the Site
The Site panel contains three options for generating activity reports—Page Views, 
User Activity, and Overview. The Page Views report displays the URL of the visited 
pages along with the ���������������������������������������������������������������
page views for each URL within the specified criteria����������
. You can 
select the relevant start and end dates from the criteria panel as shown below:
Community Server displays a calendar upon clicking the icon shown beside each date. 
You can either generate the report or export it as a 
Microsoft Office Excel Comma Separated Values (CSV) 
file format. You can do this for all reports.

Chapter 10
[ 241 ]
The User Activity report generates a list of unique IP addresses that have visited 
the site along with the page views for that visitor within the specified criteria. The 
interface looks similar to that of the generation of the page views report. 
You should create an SQL job using SQL Server 2005 that 
executes the cs_UserActivityNightlyJob �����������������
stored procedure 
in order to generate the user activity report. Refer to the 
section Creating SQL Jobs for more information regarding 
the creation of the SQL job.
The Overview report lists the total number of registered users, threads, and posts 
within the specified criteria as shown below:
Generating Reports for Blogs
You can generate blog activity report by selecting the Blog Activity link located 
under the Blogs panel in the Dashboard. The report includes a listing of all blogs 
on the site in a grid and will also shows the total blogs, total enabled blogs, total 
disabled blogs, and the total number of blogs active between the search dates. 
You can filter the report with a specific start and end date and the report will be 
generated based upon the selected criteria. 
You should create an SQL job using SQL Server 2005 that 
executes the cs_BlogActivityNightlyJob stored procedure 
in order to generate the blog activity report. Refer to the 
section Creating SQL Jobs for more information regarding 
the creation of the SQL job.
In addition to the Blog Activity report, you can also generate reports for popular 
blog topics with reference to Views and Comments. The Popular Topics by Views 
link enables you to generate a list of the top 25 blog posts based on the number of 
hits or views each received since its creation date with reference to the specified start 
and end dates as shown in the following screenshot: 

Working with Reports
[ 242 ]
In the same way, the Popular Topics by Comments link enables you to generate a 
list of the top 25 blog posts based on the number of comments that have been posted 
since the creation of each post with reference to the specified start and end dates.
Generating Reports for Forums
You can generate a forum activity report by selecting the Forum Post Activity link 
located under the Forums panel inside the Reporting link������������
. The report specifies 
the total number of active forums within the specified date range in addition to 
forum name, number of new replies, number of new threads, and active users as 
shown below:
As you can see there is only one forum that was active between the specified start 
and end date. You can navigate directly to the relevant forum if you click on the link 
in the Forum Name column. 
In addition to the Forum Activity report, you can also generate reports for popular 
forum topics with reference to Views and Replies. The Popular Topics by Views 
link enables you to generate a list of the top 25 forum posts based on the number of 
hits or views each received, since its creation date, with reference to the specified 
start and end dates as shown next: 

Chapter 10
[ 243 ]
Similarly, the Popular Topics by Replies link enables you to generate a list of the top 
25 blog posts based on the number of replies since their creation, with reference to 
the specified start and end dates.
The activity reports are not generated by default. You have to perform certain 
additional tasks as outlined in the section Setting up Activity Reports in order for the 
Community Server to generate reports. 
Working with SQL Jobs
As noted earlier, you should create the relevant SQL jobs using SQL Server 2005 
Management Studio before beginning to generate user and blog activity reports. 
This can be done by logging into SQL Server 2005 and starting the SQL Server 
Agent service (by default, this service is stopped). You can start the service by 
right-clicking SQL Server Agent and selecting Start from the pop-up menu as 
shown in the screenshot below:

Working with Reports
[ 244 ]
In order to create SQL jobs you need to install SQL 
Server 2005 Developer Edition. You can download a trial 
version of it from http://www.microsoft.com/sql/
downloads/trial-software.mspx 
SQL Server 2005 will display a progress indicator during the starting of the 
service. Once the service has been started follow the steps outlined below to set 
up activity reports:
1.	 Add the following code to the <httpModules> section of the web.config file:
       <add name="CSVisitors" type="CommunityServer.
                VisitorCountHttpModule, CommunityServer.Components" />
2.	 Add the following code to the <jobs> section of the CommunityServer.
config file. This file can be located inside the root directory of Community 
Server installation.
       <job name = "Visitors" type = "CommunityServer.Components.
                   VisitorsJob, CommunityServer.Components" enabled = 
                   "true" enableShutDown = "false" />
3.	 Create an SQL job using SQL Server 2005 that runs every morning at 1:30 AM 
or anytime after midnight that executes the cs_UserActivityNightlyJob 
stored procedure.
4.	 Create the relevant SQL job that runs every morning at 1:00 AM or anytime 
after midnight that executes the cs_BlogActivityNightlyJob stored procedure.
Creating SQL Jobs
The creation of SQL jobs is a critical aspect for the generation of reports, as reports 
are created and generated based on the jobs. In order to create an SQL job, you 
should follow the following steps:
1.	 Log in to the SQL Server 2005 management studio as an administrator.
2.	 Expand the SQL Server Agent tree. 
3.	 Right-click on the jobs section and select New Job.
4.	 Enter a name and description for the job as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 10
[ 245 ]
5.	 Check-mark the Enabled option so that the job will run immediately 
following its creation. 
6.	 From the Job Properties dialog, navigate to the Steps page.
In order to open Job Properties dialog, right click the 
created job name from the Jobs tree and select Properties 
from the pop-up menu.
7.	 Select the New button and enter the required information as shown in the 
screenshot below. You need to select the name of your database from 
the dropdown. 

Working with Reports
[ 246 ]
8.	 The above job step will execute a stored procedure. The Parse button 
located at the bottom of the New Job Step dialog enables you to check the 
syntax of your SQL command. Click the OK button to return to the Job 
Properties dialog.
9.	 Your next activity is to set a schedule for the above job step. 
10.	 For this purpose, select Schedules from the left side navigation bar. Select the 
New button and set the desired schedule by giving a name and its frequency 
as shown in the screenshot below:
11.	 The above schedule signifies that the stored procedure will run every day at 
1.00 AM starting from August 8, 2006. Click the OK button to return to the 
Job Properties page.

Chapter 10
[ 247 ]
12.	 With the above step, the process of creation of an SQL job has been 
completed. Click the OK button to return to the SQL Server 2005 
Management Studio. 
Similarly, you should create a job for the cs_UserActivityNightlyJob stored procedure. 
The SQL job will not run if you turn off your system. This is not applicable for a 
remote hosting server, which will always be on. 
You need to contact your hosting service provider to create 
the required SQL jobs for your site if you don't have access 
to the remote hosting server.
Summary
Reporting is one of the critical activities in every application. This holds true 
for Community Server as well. With the help of the reporting functionality, site 
administrators can generate and view different kinds of reports. In addition to the 
exceptions and jobs reports, we have also examined the working of user, blog and 
forum activity reports. We also examined the creation of the SQL jobs that require to 
be created in a live hosting environment for generating various activity reports. 


 
Working with System Tools
As an Administrator of Community Server, you need to properly manage critical 
functions such as those of advertisements, licenses, and articles. Moreover, you will 
be required to restrict the usage of site by implementing spam control measures 
included with Community Server. In this chapter, you will learn how to manage all 
of these functions in detail.
Getting Started
Once you are logged in to the site as an Administrator, click the Control Panel link 
from the top navigation bar. Click Administration and expand the System Tools 
panel. You will see a list of options as shown the following screenshot:
Let us now examine the options available in the System Tool panel in detail.

Working with System Tools
[ 250 ]
Working with Ads
Nowadays, advertisements forms a part and parcel of each and every website. The 
Administrator of the site will earn revenue as and when users click on the displayed 
advertisements. The ads can either be text or images. You can implement various 
kinds of popular advertisement systems such as Google AdSense or Amazon's 
affiliate system on your Community Server site depending upon the requirements. 
As an Administrator, you can enable advertisements from Dashboard | 
Administration by selecting the Manage Ads link located under System Tools. Let 
us examine each of the options available for the management of ads in detail.
Enabling Ads
As soon as you activate the Enable Ads option from the Manage Ads page, a link 
titled Ad PlaceHolder will be added to the top and bottom portion of the home page. 
An important feature of this setting is that the relevant ad 
will be displayed on each page of the site. 
An Administrator can easily add the required code for the display of ads by double- 
clicking the Ad PlaceHolder link.
In order to manually configure ads for your site, you need 
to modify Skin-Ads.ascx located under the \Themes\
default\Skins directory inside the root of your 
Community Server site. 
Implementing Google AdSense on your site
Let us now examine how to display Google AdSense on the site. As mentioned 
above, you can add the code for the display of ads either at the top or bottom of the 
page by double‑clicking the relevant placeholders. 

Chapter 11
[ 251 ]
You can generate the code for Adsense for content, 
AdSense for search, and referrals by logging in at 
http://www.google.com/adsense if you are already 
a member of Google's AdSense Program. Otherwise, you 
should apply and wait for the approval email from Google.
As soon as you double‑click an Ad PlaceHolder link������������������������������
, a pop-up dialog box will be 
displayed. You have to add the required code as shown below:
<center>
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
google_ad_format = "468x60_as";
google_ad_type = "text";
google_ad_channel ="";
//--></script>
<script type="text/javascript"
  src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
</center>
As you can see from the above code, we have deliberately masked the value of 
google_ad_client property for security reasons. Your daily earnings are calculated 
with reference to this property and it is extremely important to supply the correct 
code, which you generated and copied by logging into the website of Google 
AdSense. ����������������������������������������������������������������������������
 The relevant ad will be displayed on the home page of the site immediately 
on clicking the Save Changes button, as shown below:
Implementing Amazon Associates on 
your Site
Like Google's AdSense program, Amazon also provides an Associates or Affiliate 
scheme for its customers. You can either display a text link or an image on your 
site and revenues are generated based on each sale made through the site. The 

Working with System Tools
[ 252 ]
commissions are calculated based upon the link and each customer will have to add 
a different Associate code for earning income. The relevant Associate code will be 
embedded inside the HTML code. In this section, we will examine how to display an 
advertisement using Amazon's Associates Program on your site.
You need to register at http://associates.amazon.
com/gp/associates/join/102-0670951-7143347 
in order to generate the required code for the purpose of 
displaying advertisements. 
In order to display a particular advertisement, you first have to generate the HTML 
code from the Build Links ����������
page by logging into your affiliate section located at 
http://associates.amazon.com. You will then need to double‑click the Ad 
PlaceHolder link from the home page of your Community Server site and add the 
required code, which you copied from the website of Amazon. 
The relevant advertisement will be displayed as shown below, on the home page of 
the site, immediately upon clicking the Save Changes button. 
Implementing Inline Ads
The Enable Inline Ad Control option inside the Manage Ads page enables 
you to showcase skinned advertisements. The ads have to be configured and 
sourced from third party advertisement software such as BanManPro 
(http://www.banmanpro.com). You have to place the necessary JavaScript to display 
ads, which you generated by using the ad serving software, by double‑clicking the 
Ad via Inline Control link ���������������������������������������������������
 from the home page of your Community Server site. 
Working with Disallowed Names
With the help of the Manage Disallowed Names setting, the Administrator can 
prevent inappropriate names, called disallowed names, from being displayed on 
the site and being used as usernames during user registration. Community Server 
provides a list of some of these disallowed names, which are displayed in the page 
that appears after clicking the Manage Disallowed Names setting. You can also 

Chapter 11
[ 253 ]
create them by supplying the name to be disallowed in the Name field and clicking 
the Create button as shown below: 
From the above screenshot you can see that a disallowed name moderator is created 
that will be added in the list of disallowed names. Hence the Community Server 
will prohibit any user registering as moderator and display a message: Filled in 
username is prohibited on this forum. Please choose other username.
Now you know how to disallow a user from registering as moderator, you can also 
disallow names that are similar to this username like moderator1, moderatoradmin, 
and so on.
You have to move to the page where all the disallowed names are displayed and 
scroll down to the name moderator. Click the Edit button, append an asterisk (*) 
to the name, and save the changes by clicking the Update button as shown in the 
screenshot below:
The modified name is added to the list of disallowed names and Community Server 
will prohibit any user registering with a username starting with moderator. 
You should note that enclosing the word in asterisks as shown above will ban any 
name containing the string mod. �������������������������
As soon as you click the Create button, the name 
will be added to the disallowed names list as shown in the following screenshot:
You can also modify and delete the name by selecting the Edit and Delete buttons 
respectively from the Actions column. When a new member tries to register on 
the site and attempts to use the disallowed name a message is displayed on the 
registration page as shown in the screenshot overleaf:

Working with System Tools
[ 254 ]
If an existing member attempts to change their display name by clicking the 
username link on the top of the site to a name that is in the disallowed name list, then 
Community Server will not accept the change. Community Server recognizes that the 
name is disallowed and will automatically display the permitted original username. 
You should note that disallowed names do not censor 
content in posts or comments.
Working with Censorship
With the help of censorship, you can prevent unsuitable words or phrases from 
visitor-submitted content being displayed on your site. Community Server provides 
a list of obscene words with which it scans text. You can view them by clicking the 
Manage/Create Censorships setting.
A word that is found to be inappropriate will be replaced by text called a 
Replacement Token. By default, these tokens will be displayed in the form of three 
asterisks (***). However, you can edit them by selecting the Edit button and entering 
a new token as shown below:
Community Server will display the modified token for the corresponding word 
immediately after you select the Update button as shown in the screenshot.

Chapter 11
[ 255 ]
Creating Censored Words
Community Server provides an option to add a new word in the list of inappropriate 
words. In order to create a censored word, scroll down, and enter the desired word 
and a replacement token in the relevant field as below:
The relevant word will be added to the grid on clicking the Create button as 
shown below:
We have successfully created a word pqrs with a token ### corresponding to it. Let 
us now submit a post on the forum with the above created censored word. The final 
output will appear as below: 
Working with Smilies
Emoticons or Smilies are a smart way to express your behavior or attitude that can 
be conveyed along with your posts. You can manage them by selecting the� Manage/
Create Smilies setting. By default, Community Server provides an exhaustive 
collection of smilies as shown overleaf. 

Working with System Tools
[ 256 ]
You can modify the Code, URL, Image, and Description of a particular smiley or 
emoticon by selecting the Edit button as shown below:
By default, the images are stored in the Emoticons folder 
located inside the Community Server installation directory. 
In order to add a smiley, scroll down to the bottom of the page, enter the Code, 
URL, and Description of the new smiley ���������������
 and click the Create button. You should 
upload the relevant image inside the Emoticons directory and rename the image 
according to the last item found on the list. For instance, if the file name of the last 
smiley is emotion-60.gif, then you can rename the image that you are going to add 
as emotion-61.gif.
Let us now discuss how to use emoticons. Log in to the site as a user and create a 
new post by selecting the Write a New Post button from the relevant forum. You 
need to pick an emoticon by clicking the Insert Smiley icon from the toolbar of the 
content editor and the corresponding emoticon will be displayed inside a pop‑up 
window. The relevant code for the selected emoticon will be displayed in the editor 
as shown overleaf:

Chapter 11
[ 257 ]
You should note from the above screenshot that the editor displays the code for the 
selected smiley. The associated image will be displayed when the post is submitted 
as shown in the following screenshot:
Working with Articles
Articles are short content, compositions or publications on a certain subject posted 
on the site. You can link them while creating blog or forum posts. The difference 
between blog posts and articles is that your users can only view the posted content. 
They cannot post comments or rate the article. This feature will be useful if you 
would like to showcase certain content that doesn't require user feedback. 
You can create and manage articles by clicking the Manage/Create Articles link. 
Community Server will display the content editor immediately after selecting the 
Create new article button from the Manage Articles page. The look and feel of the 
content editor will be the same as we saw while discussing blogs and forums. 
You need to give the name for the article, a headline title, and the required content 
inside the content editor as shown in the following screenshot:

Working with System Tools
[ 258 ]
The above article is saved and created immediately upon clicking the Save Changes 
button. You can also immediately view the output after its creation as shown in the 
screenshot below:
You can directly update the content of the article by selecting the Edit link and 
manage all the articles by clicking the Manage articles link at the top of the preview 
page of the article. 

Chapter 11
[ 259 ]
You can not only view the articles but can also modify them by clicking the Edit 
button, which will display the content editor page populated with the relevant 
article. You need to click on the Save Changes button after updating the content. 
You can also delete the article by selecting the *Delete Immediately* button if you 
feel that the article is no longer required. 
As you can see from the screenshot, Community Server uses part of the supplied 
name to create the file name. For our sample article opposite, the Uniform Resource 
Locator (URL) will be http://localhost/cs21/content/LearningC2005.
aspx. You will notice that the spaces and hash that we gave in the Name field are 
automatically removed from the Article Name column. 
Working with Spam Blocker
Community Server provides an interface for blocking spam. Spam is often referred 
to as unsolicited and illegal posts and is used in conjunction with emails. The same 
policy also applies to forums as well. Popular forums may at some point attract 
spam, which detracts from genuine content posted. As an Administrator, you need 
to develop a mechanism to prevent these sorts of problems. 
Community Server includes a built‑in functionality with which site administrators 
can effectively manage spam. It can be accessed by clicking the Manage Spam 
Blocker link. 
The Spam Blocker not only checks the forum posts but also 
the comments posted under each blog and photo galleries.
The Spam blocker interface displays an interface with two important options: 
Site settings for marking comments as moderated and Site settings for deleting 
comments suspected as spam. These settings work in relation to the rules specified 
under the Rules section. Let us examine these settings in detail.
The Site settings for marking comments as moderated option specifies the score 
value for moderating comments posted to the site. If a post generates a value equal 
to or above a particular limit set but below the value of the Site settings for deleting 
comments suspected as spam option, then that post is subject to moderation 

Working with System Tools
[ 260 ]
automatically. Community Server checks for the limits from the enabled rules. The 
default value is 5 and this means that any post that crosses this limit will be passed 
on to the moderator prior to display on the site. Any post that is below the value of 5 
will be automatically visible on the site depending upon the site settings enabled by 
the Administrator.
The Site settings for deleting comments suspected as spam option will also work as 
discussed above with the difference that any post which crosses the value specified 
on the field will not appear on the site. Instead it will be available inside the Deleted 
Posts forum for further review. The default value for this setting is 10. However, site 
Administrators can change the value depending upon the requirement.
The Deleted Posts forum can be accessed only by a 
site administrator. 
Examining the Rules
Community Server includes a set of four rules Bad Word Count, Forbidden Word, 
IP Count, �����
 and Link Count as shown in the screenshot below: 
These rules effectively manage all spam-related content on the site. You can 
configure each rule by clicking the Configure button and activate the rule by 
selecting the Enabled checkbox from each row. Let us examine each one of the above 
rules in detail.

Chapter 11
[ 261 ]
Bad Word Count
This rule provides a list of bad words, which are used for filtering the content posted 
on the site. The site administrator can assign points for each bad word, specify how 
many times a bad word can appear in the post, and can also add new words as 
shown in the screenshot below:
Community Server automatically filters the post when a specific bad word appears 
more than the specified maximum number of times. However, you can modify the 
setting according to your preferences. 
Rules are not enabled by default. The site administrator 
should enable them after going through their configuration.
Forbidden Word
This setting specifies a list of forbidden or prohibited words. These words need not 
be bad. Community Server doesn't provide a list of these words like Bad Words. 
Instead administrators should provide them as shown below along with the number 
of points for each time in appears in a post. The default value for this rule is 5.

Working with System Tools
[ 262 ]
There is a marginal difference between a Bad Word and a Forbidden word. 
The Bad Word Spam rule assigns points when a word considered bad appears more 
than once. For example, "casino" may be used in the context of a message so one 
appearance may be acceptable. However, multiple appearances of the same word 
will cause an accumulation of points towards being Spam. This rule has a threshold. 
The Forbidden Word Spam rule assigns points whenever a word exists. Points are 
given for each instance of the word. This rule does not have a threshold.
IP Count
With Community Server, you can manage posts based on IP addresses. The system 
will perform a check based on the number of recent posts from the same IP address. 
This is done to avoid malicious attempts to flood a forum with useless posts by a 
particular IP address. It consists of several settings as shown in the screenshot below:
You can enter the number of points to assign each post beyond the threshold; the 
default value is 5. You need to specify the maximum number of posts that can be 
created from the same IP address within the specified period; the default value is 1. 
You also need to specify the time span to search for posts from the same IP address; 
the default value is 60 seconds. You may know certain IP addresses that do not 
require application of this rule. You can specify a list of these IP addresses separated 
by semicolons from which this rule will never check for spam.

Chapter 11
[ 263 ]
Link Count
The Link Count rule enables you to block any post that contains more than a 
specified number of links and is applicable only for blog comments. This rule has 
direct relationship with the Site settings for marking comments as moderated 
setting that is displayed on the Manage Spam Blocker page.
Assuming the values of all the settings are set to default, users can post only 2 links 
along with their comments on each blog post. The remaining comments with more 
than 2 links will be visible only after the approval of the Administrator or moderator. 
Hence, if a user posts a comment with 3 links then the corresponding post will fetch 
6 points (3 links * 2) and will be visible on the comments page after its approval by 
the Administrator. We have discussed about the approval of comments in Chapter 3 
- Working with Blogs. 
However, if you set the value of  the The maximum number of links that can appear 
in the post setting to 1 then a maximum of 3 links will be displayed on the comments 
page. These link submissions don’t require any moderation. However, the blog post 
will not display any comments which contain more than 3 links. This will be visible 
on the comments page as and when they are approved by the Administrator or 
moderator. 
Installing New Spam Rules
Telligent or other developers may develop enhanced spam content filtering controls 
and they will be available from the Downloads section of the official website as and 
when they are released. You have to copy the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file of 
the downloaded new control and place it in the bin directory of your Community 
Server installation. Now you need to click the Reload Rules button located at the 
bottom of the Manage Spam Blocker page to enable the newly set rules in the 
Community Server.
Working with the Member Points System
Community Server includes a system called Member Points with which you can 
allocate specified numbers of points according to the activities performed by each 
member on the site. These activities include submission of posts, posting a reply, and 

Working with System Tools
[ 264 ]
much more. But in order to work with this feature, you require a standard license or 
above of Community Server. 
As an Administrator, you can manage points by clicking the Manage Member 
Points System setting. Firstly, you need to activate the Enable Member Points 
System setting from the General tab of the Manage Member Points System page. 
Let us examine the settings included in each tab in detail.
General
With the help of the settings on this tab you can enable and control the visibility of 
points for posts and users.
Enable the Member Points System
You can enable or disable member points by selecting the required value. By default, 
this setting is disabled. As noted earlier, you need to enable the setting. If it is 
enabled, points are calculated for both posts and users. 
Post Points Visibility
With the help of this setting, you can control the visibility of points measured 
for posts. By default, the points will be visible to all users of the site. But you can 
restrict the viewing of points by selecting the Don't show to anyone or Show only to 
Administrators and Moderators option from the drop‑down box associated with the 
Post Points Visibility setting. 
User Points Visibility
With the help of this setting, you can control the visibility of points measured for 
users. By default, the points will be visible to all users of the site. But you can restrict 
the viewing of points by selecting the Don't show to anyone or Show only to 
Administrators and Moderators option from the drop‑down box associated with the 
User Points Visibility setting.
Factor Values
With the help of the settings on this tab you can specify the values with which the 
points will be calculated and displayed on the site.

Chapter 11
[ 265 ]
Post Factor
This setting specifies the amount for each post. The default value is 5; hence if a �����
user� 
submits 10 posts then that particular user will earn 50 points.
Reply Factor
This setting specifies the amount for each reply made for the original post by users. 
The default value is 15 and if a user makes 2 replies then the original user who 
posted the download will get 30 points.
Replier Factor
This setting specifies the amount for each unique reply made for the original post by 
users. The points will be counted only if a fresh user replies to a specific post. If a same 
user submits more than one reply then that will not be counted. The default value is 5.
Rating Factor
This setting measures the amount of points each original poster will earn when 
somebody rates their posts on the site. The default value is 6.
Download Factor
This setting specifies the amount for each download made from the original post by 
users. The default value is 5 and if a user downloads 2 files then the original user 
who posted the download will get 10 points.
Downloader Factor
This setting specifies the amount for each unique download made from the original 
post by the users. The points will not be counted if the same user downloads the file 
more than once. The default value is 5.
Favorite Post Factor
This setting signifies the amount of points which will accumulate when a user rates a 
particular post as favorite. The default value is 5.
Favorite User Factor
This setting signifies the amount of points which will accumulate when a user rates a 
particular user as favourite. The default value is 100.

Working with System Tools
[ 266 ]
Rater Factor
The points system not only benefits a user but also benefits those who rate a post or 
user. This setting signifies the amount of points that can be earned by a registered 
user when that user rates a post or user on the site. 
Calculate
This tab consists of a single button captioned Calculate and you should click it 
if you have made any modifications to the values for the various settings as 
mentioned previously. 
Make sure to click the Save button after modifying the 
values before attempting to click the Calculate button. 
Viewing Member Points
The Member Points functionality is mainly implemented for forums. You can 
view the points earned by each user while accessing each post as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Working with Licenses
As discussed in ��������������������������������������������������������������������
Chapter 1�����������������������������������������������������������
, the Express edition is available free of cost. ����������
To access 
extra functionality and resilience you may wish to consider the purchase of a license.� 
As we explained in �������������������������������������������������������������������
the chapter, �������������������������������������������������������
 there are different types of licenses and you need to 
purchase a license depending upon the requirements of your site. 

Chapter 11
[ 267 ]
The System Tools section provides a separate area for the installation and 
management of various licenses and it can be accessed by clicking the Manage 
Licenses link. In order to install a license, you need the required set of files, which 
will be emailed to you by Telligent as soon as you purchase a license for your site. It 
includes an XML file with the required information pertaining to the license and also 
a license agreement file in PDF format. 
There is no need to request an additional license if you 
have installed Community Server 2.0 as the same license 
file can be used for Community Server 2.1.
You need to install the XML file in order to activate the license for your site by 
clicking the Install button after browsing and locating the required XML file. The 
path will be displayed inside the Install License File field. Community Server will 
display the required information regarding the installed license after the successful 
completion of the installation process as shown in the following screenshot:
As you can observe from the above screenshot, a Professional edition license 
has been installed with the version number 2.0. You can also purchase additional 
modules and install them using the Manage Licenses page. 
With Community Server 2.0, license-related information 
is stored in the database rather than the file system as was 
done in the previous versions.
Working with URL Redirects
Sometimes, you will be required to create special URLs for certain content that 
changes very frequently. In such cases you can employ a mechanism of uploading 
the content to one location and maintaining another link with which users can 
access that particular content. The advantage of this system is that you only need to 
perform modifications in one place. The users will access it using a special URL even 
if the original content changes very often. This concept is termed URL Redirection. 

Working with System Tools
[ 268 ]
With Community Server, you can create ������������������������������������������
URL ���������������������������������������
 Redirects very easily. Let us examine 
this functionality in detail.
You have to click the Manage Url Redirects link available under the System Tools 
section. You need to enter the URL where the original content has been uploaded in 
the Redirect Url field and also a short description about the URL in the Description 
field as shown below:
Click the Create button to create the appropriate URL redirection link after entering 
the required information. The relevant Redirection URL will be created immediately 
as shown in the following screenshot:
The above URL is the actual link where you will be redirected upon entering another 
URL. ��������������������������������������������
 �������������������������������������������
You can get this other URL by clicking the View button as shown in the 
following screenshot:
If you navigate to http://localhost/cs21/r.ashx?1, then you will be 
automatically redirected to http://www.communityserver.org. Hence, even if the 
content has been updated at http://www.communityserver.org, it will have no 
effect on the redirection URL as it always stays constant. 
In addition to the URL the Url Redirect pop-up window showed above also 
displays the link statistics which shows how many users have so far accessed the 
redirection URL.

Chapter 11
[ 269 ]
Handling Mass Emails
Occasionally, you may wish to send general purpose emails to your members. The 
content of these emails can be related to maintenance issues, monthly newsletters, 
or any updates to the products you sell. As your site grows, the number of members 
who register on the site also increases. Hence, it will be cumbersome to send separate 
emails to all members. 
Community Server includes a module for handling bulk emails and it can be accessed 
by clicking the Send Mass Email link. You will see a page that enables you to select a 
group to distribute the email to, from the Recipient(s) drop‑down box, and compose 
the required content by supplying the required Subject and Message appropriately. 
You can take advantage of the rich features of the content editor as well.
Click the Send button to deliver the message to the concerned recipients after 
entering the required information.
Banning an IP Address
Sometimes, your site may be either hacked or subjected to Denial-of-Service attacks. 
Immediately, you should try to stop these types of attacks in future. A nice way to do 
this is to find out the IP address of the attacker and then block that address using the 
various tools on the server. In most cases, you will not have access to these tools. In 
such a situation you have to find out alternative ways to resolve the problem. 
Community Server includes a built‑in functionality to ban an IP address and it can 
be accessed by clicking the IP Address Banning link. You should note that this 
functionality is available only if you have installed the standard version or above of 
Community Server. 
You need to enter the required IP address and click on the Add IP Address button. 
You can also enter range such as 111.111.11.*. As soon as you click the button the IP 
address will be displayed on the screen as shown in the screenshot:
Once an IP Address has been blocked it can be deleted or unblocked by clicking 
the Delete button. You can also manually view the banned IP addresses from the 
cs_BannedAddresses table using the various tools for accessing databases such as 
SQL Server 2005 Express Edition or SQL Server 2005. 

Working with System Tools
[ 270 ]
Working with Event Log Viewer
Once Community Server has been successfully deployed, Administrators and users 
perform various activities. These activities are recorded in the Event Log Viewer 
page, as shown in the screenshot overleaf, which can be accessed by clicking the 
Event Logs link. The page includes starting and stopping of various services 
included with Community Server, failed login attempts, and other related status 
and activity messages. 
As you can see from the above screenshot, the grid displays a list of events that 
occurred during the usage of Community Server. You can view the details of each 
event in the Event Log Entry pop-up window when you click the relevant link that 
in the ID column
In a same way, you can view the log of each event separately. The log will be 
separated into pages if there are numerous entries. � 
Summary
In this chapter, we have examined the management of some of the core aspects 
involved with the usage of Community Server. You have learned how to implement 
Google AdSense and Amazon's affliate system into Community Server. You have 
learned about the working of censorship, spam and IP address blocker, and the 
management of licenses. You also learned about the Member Points system and the 
creation and management of ��������������
URL �����������
 Redirects.

Deploying Community Server
We hope that you have now gained sufficient knowledge to work effectively with 
Community Server. We examined the process of deploying it on a local system in 
Chapter 2. Your next task is to properly deploy Community Server on a web‑hosting 
server and this appendix describes the steps required to get your site hosted on a live 
web server.
Registering a Domain Name
A domain name is your identity on the web. Hence, you need to pick up a 
name that resembles your business. You can register a domain name from a 
provider of your choice. Two of the popular providers of domain name registrations 
are NetworkSolutions (http://www.netsol.com) and Go Daddy 
(http://www.godaddy.com).
Obtaining a Web Space
Once you register a domain name, you need to obtain server space from a web 
hosting provider. Initially, a minimum amount of space such as 100 MB is sufficient. 
You can upgrade it later on depending upon the usage of your site. You should make 
sure that the web server contains the following software:
1.	 Windows Server 2003
2.	 ASP.NET 1.1 or ASP.NET 2.0
3.	 Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or Microsoft SQL Server 2005
Moreover, you should ask your provider questions regarding monthly bandwidth, 
location of the server, future upgrade capability of your web space, etc.

Deploying Community Server

You can also post general hosting-related questions at: 
http://forums.asp.net/default.aspx?GroupID=29 
Uploading Files
Before proceeding to upload the files, you should first create the required database. 
Refer to Chapter 2 for more information regarding creation of databases. 
Normally, all hosting packages include a web-based Control Panel for managing 
your website. Helm (h�������������������������������
ttp://www.webhostautomation.com) is one of the fastest 
Control Panels for Windows Servers followed by Plesk (http://www.swsoft.com). 
Both of these hosting Control Panels provide a facility to install Community Server 
from within the web‑based system without any need for you to either run the built-
in installer or upload the files to the server using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). All the 
required files will be automatically placed into the appropriate folder on the server 
upon successful completion of the setup process.  
Many popular web hosting providers such as ASPnix 
(http://www.aspnix.com) and HostingFest 
(http://www.hostingfest.com) provide technical support 
for configuration and installation of Community Server for 
your website.
You can, however, install only the version of Community Server provided by your 
web hosting provider using the above mentioned method. If you wish to upgrade 
or install a newer version then you should manually upload the files by using �����
File 
Transfer Protocol (FTP) ���������������������������
software such as SmartFTP (http://www.smartftp.com), 
CuteFTP (http://www.cuteftp.com), or CoreFTP (http://www.coreftp.com/). 
You can also install Community Server on a Virtual Private 
Server (VPS) offered by popular companies such as ASPnix 
(http://www.aspnix.com). �����������������������������
The advantage of hosting the 
site on a VPS is that you get access to the remote server so that 
you can directly download and unzip the files from within 
the remote desktop without any need to contact your web 
hosting provider.

Appendix A
[ 273 ]
T�����������������������������������������������������������������������������
he main disadvantage of uploading the files using FTP is that it will take a 
substantial amount of time to upload the files inside certain folders. We would 
suggest you to upload the required ZIP file inside the root directory of your website 
and contact your provider to unzip them in order to avoid the difficulty. You should 
then run the built-in installer to set up Community Server on your site as described 
in Chapter 2. 
You have successfully deployed Community Server on a live web server. You can 
now sit back and relax while the visitors browse your site. You have already seen 
the powerful management capabilities of Community Server in the earlier chapters 
of this book. You need to use all the available techniques effectively to maximize the 
efficiency of your website. You should also make use of Search Engine Optimization 
(SEO) to effectively market and thereby boost the traffic of your website 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).
