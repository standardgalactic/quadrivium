Preface
This book is more than a textbook on electric circuits. 
It is a veritable learning reference that presents electric 
circuit analysis in a simplified manner, without sacrific-
ing rigor and thoroughness. The book is a sequel to the 
author’s Electric Circuits and Signals, CRC Press, 2008. 
The electric signal material has been omitted and circuit 
analysis is treated in a more simplified and expanded 
form. The book differs from other textbooks on electric 
circuits in its pedagogy and organization, as expounded 
later, particularly in the following respects:
	
1.	Strong emphasis on (a) simple, clear, careful, 
and comprehensive explanations of the basic 
concepts in circuit analysis (simplicity is not to 
be construed as superficiality; what is meant is 
simple and clear, but in-depth, explanations); 
(b) a sound understanding of fundamentals, 
enhanced by physical and insightful interpre-
tations of circuit behavior; and (c) extensive 
use of PSpice® (OrCAD, PSpice, SPECTRA for 
OrCAD, and Cadence are registered ­trademarks 
of Cadence Design Systems, Inc., San Jose, 
California), as detailed later in a section on 
PSpice simulations.
	
2.	Effective problem solving based on (a) a sys-
tematic, logical, and imaginative approach, 
having the acronym ISDEPIC, formulated by 
the author and refined over the past several 
years through interaction with students, and (b) 
presenting a variety of topics and examples that 
foster problem-solving skills by encouraging 
the student to view a problem in different ways, 
particularly fresh and original ways, founded 
on a sound understanding of fundamentals. 
The author firmly believes that a course on elec-
tric circuits provides an excellent opportunity 
to nurture problem-solving skills, as a central 
objective of quality engineering education. That 
is why some topics, such as exploitation of sym-
metry in electric circuits, are included, although 
they are of limited practical importance.
	
3.	Substantive application of the substitution the-
orem and of duality to facilitate circuit analy-
sis and enhance the understanding of circuit 
behavior.
	
4.	Some original contributions to circuit analysis 
by the author, such as (a) using the substitution 
theorem to replace dependent sources by inde-
pendent sources when applying superposition, 
which greatly simplifies analysis of circuits that 
include dependent sources; (b) circuit equiva-
lence, as a unifying concept that encompasses 
a variety of topics, ranging from simple series–
parallel combinations of resistances to source 
transformation and Thevenin’s theorem; and 
(c) the concept of effective magnetic flux, which 
allows dealing with leakage flux simply and 
conveniently, rather than skirt this seemingly 
awkward issue.
P.1  Pedagogy
The underlying theme throughout the book is present-
ing circuit analysis logically, coherently, and justifiably, 
yet simply and clearly, and not as a set of procedures 
that are to be followed without really understanding the 
“why?” in terms of critical thinking, logical reasoning, 
and sound understanding of fundamentals.
The following features exemplify this approach to 
­circuit analysis:
	
1.	It is emphasized from the very beginning that 
circuits obey two universal conservation laws: 
conservation of energy and conservation of 
charge, which imply, respectively, conserva-
tion of power and conservation of current. 
Kirchhoff’s laws are simply an expression of 
these conservation laws and not some sacro-
sanct laws that are peculiar to electric circuits. 
They are convenient to apply in lieu of the more 
fundamental conservation laws because they 
are linear in voltage and current.
	
2.	The rationale behind the node-voltage and 
mesh-current methods is explained as having 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law automatically satisfied 
by the assignment of node voltages and having 
Kirchhoff’s current law automatically satisfied 
by the assignment of mesh currents.
	
3.	Circuit simplification techniques and effective 
­problem-solving methodologies are strongly 
emphasized to help the student analyze electric 
circuits intelligently, understand their behavior, 
and gain insight into this behavior. These topics 
are thoroughly discussed before the node-­voltage 
and mesh-current methods—because in the 

xxii	
Preface
author’s experience, once students learn these rou-
tine, general methods, they tend to preferentially 
apply them to all circuits, even simple ones. This 
deprives students of the opportunity to under-
stand circuit behavior and to foster their problem-
solving skills. Another reason for deemphasizing 
the node-voltage and mesh-current methods is 
that these methods were originally developed to 
facilitate analysis of more complicated circuits. 
But the responses of such circuits are more conve-
niently derived nowadays by PSpice simulation.
	
4.	In conformity with conventional practice, prac-
tically all the main circuit concepts and proce-
dures are presented for the dc state to begin 
with. Some textbooks then discuss the transient 
behavior of RC, RL, and RLC circuits before the 
sinusoidal steady state. In this book, the sinu-
soidal steady state is discussed immediately 
following the dc state. The reason for this is 
that phasor analysis is presented as a means of 
allowing direct application of all the concepts 
and techniques developed for the dc state to the 
sinusoidal steady state. It is only logical, there-
fore, to consider the sinusoidal steady state 
immediately following the dc state.
	
5.	Magnetic coupling is discussed in a comprehensive, 
realistic, and not oversimplified manner, using 
the concept of effective flux. Magnetic flux link-
age is properly made use of as a basic quantity. It 
is emphasized that ideal transformers, irrespective 
of the number of windings and how they are inter-
connected, obey two fundamental, general princi-
ples: (a) the same volts/turn are induced in every 
winding, and (b) zero, net mmf acts on the core.
	
6.	Duality is emphasized as a means of unifying 
in many respects the analysis of (a) series and 
parallel circuits of all types and (b) capacitive 
and inductive circuits.
	
7.	Simplified and generalized methods are pre-
sented for deriving the responses of first-order 
and second-order circuits in the time domain.
	
8.	The role of the transient response is clearly 
explained as a means of providing a smooth 
transition from the initial value of a given 
response to its steady-state, final value. 
	
9.	The basic, noninverting, and inverting op amp 
configurations are discussed in terms of the 
very fundamental concept of feedback. It is 
explained very simply and clearly how nega-
tive feedback, but not positive feedback, allows 
stable operation at any point in the linear region 
of the input–output characteristic of the op 
amp. It is stressed that this requires some ­circuit 
connection between the op amp output and the 
inverting input, a feature that is present in all 
non-switching-type op amp circuits.
	 10.	The four basic types of frequency responses 
(low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and bandstop) 
are all derived from a series RLC circuit to high-
light the interrelations between these responses. 
It is emphasized that second-order, passive RC 
circuits cannot have a Q larger than 0.5, corre-
sponding to critical damping.
	 11.	The rationale for Butterworth and active filters 
is clearly explained.
	 12.	Complex power and maximum power transfer 
under general conditions are included in Part II, 
after considering power due to periodic func-
tions. The conservation of complex power is 
simply and clearly explained.
	 13.	The impulse and step responses of RC, RL, and 
RLC circuits are discussed systematically and 
logically, with physical interpretations.
	 14.	The concepts of equivalent capacitance and 
equivalent inductance are applied in a simple 
and imaginative manner to derive the responses 
of capacitive and inductive circuits to sudden 
changes, with or without initial energy storage.
	 15.	Convolution is treated as an operation in the 
time domain that is important in its own right 
and that follows directly from the impulse 
response. The physical interpretation and signif-
icance of convolution are emphasized, particu-
larly the special cases of convolution of staircase 
functions and convolution with the impulse and 
step functions.
	 16.	Responses to periodic inputs, the Laplace trans-
form, the Fourier transform, and two-port cir-
cuits are covered rather comprehensively.
	 17.	Numerous references are made, ­whenever 
appropriate, to MATLAB® commands as a very 
useful aid to circuit analysis.
P.2  Organization
The book is divided into two parts. Part I covers what is 
conventionally considered as basic electric circuit anal-
ysis and constitutes a first course on electric circuits. 
Part II consists of a number of additional topics that can 
be selectively added in a second course. Operational 
amplifiers are not included in Part I, because they are 
not considered part of basic electric circuits. They are 
included as the first chapter of Part II in connection with 
active filters, where they belong. They could be added to 

Preface	
xxiii
a first course on electric circuits, if desired. Some sections 
and examples in both Parts I and II are marked with a 
star to indicate that they may be skipped in a more lim-
ited coverage of the material.
More than 430 exercises are included at the ends of 
most sections of chapters, or within sections. These 
exercises are of two types: (1) Primal exercises that are 
simple, straightforward applications of the main con-
cepts discussed and are intended to allow students to 
practice direct applications of concepts and help them 
gain some self-confidence in doing so and (2) exercises 
that are not labeled “Primal” and that serve to extend 
some aspects of the topics discussed, or to verify some 
simple assertions made in the text, and not discussed 
in detail for the sake of brevity or avoidance of tedious 
repetition.
More than 175 solved examples are included through-
out the book to illustrate the topic being discussed. In 
almost all examples, a PSpice simulation is added after 
the solution, followed by problem-solving tips, when-
ever appropriate, to emphasize some useful problem-
solving techniques.
A “Learning Checklist” is added at the end of the main 
body of every chapter so as to serve both as a summary 
and as a check on the understanding of the main con-
cepts and ideas presented in the chapter. The Learning 
Checklist is followed by a list of all the problem-solving 
tips in the solved examples of the chapter.
More than 1500 problems are included at the ends 
of chapters for students to test their understanding 
of the material and apply the problem-solving skills 
they have acquired. Some of these are of the “short-
solution” type that test for the understanding of a 
specific concept, without involving much ­calculation. 
Other problems are of the “long-solution” type that 
require the logical formulation of a number of sequen-
tial calculation steps in order to obtain the required 
results. In general, the exercises and problems are 
ordered in increasing level of “challenge.” Design-type 
problems are included as a group at the ends of some 
chapters, wherever appropriate. Another group of 
problems, labeled “Probing Further,” are added at the 
ends of some chapters in order to examine some more 
advanced or specific topics. Answers are given follow-
ing all exercises and problems that are not intended to 
verify or prove something.
P.3  PSpice Simulations
More than 100 PSpice simulations are included in the 
book, as listed after the Preface. The simulations are 
used to verify the results of analytical solutions and 
to graphically illustrate these results, wherever appli-
cable. The simulation procedure is described in every 
case. The circuit, as entered, is shown, the entries in 
the simulation profile are indicated, and the graphi-
cal or analytical results are presented. An appendix 
on PSpice simulation is included, which is more than 
adequate for the simulations covered in a course on 
electric circuits. The appendix includes much useful 
information on PSpice simulations that is not found 
in any single reference on PSpice simulations that the 
author is aware of.
The PSpice program used is OrCAD 16.6 Lite version. 
PSpice Lite can be downloaded by students from the 
Cadence web page, free of charge. The simulation files 
of the PSpice simulations listed after the Preface can 
be downloaded from the book’s web page that can be 
accessed at: https://www.crcpress.com/ to enable stu-
dents to actually perform the simulations. Additional files 
will be made available at this website in the future for the 
PSpice simulation of problems at the ends of chapters.
P.4  Solutions Manual and 
Classroom Presentations
A solutions manual for all exercises and problems, as 
well as Class Presentations, are available to qualifying 
instructors adopting this book, and may be requested 
through the CRC Press website. The Class Presentations 
consist of a Microsoft Word® file for every chapter 
that presents, in the form of colored, bulleted text 
and figures, the main ideas and concepts discussed 
in the given chapter, together with the solved exam-
ples. The files are intended for projection in the class-
room by instructors for use as a basis for explaining 
the material. The advantages of using Word files are 
the following: (1) the files can be easily modified by 
instructors as they deem appropriate for their own 
purposes and (2) top and bottom margins can be hid-
den, which allows seamless scrolling, up and down, 
through the whole file.

Convention for Voltage and Current Symbols
The following convention for current and voltage sym-
bols is adhered to in this book as much as possible:
•	 Capital letter with capital subscript denotes dc, 
or average, quantity. Example: VO.
•	 Capital letter with lowercase subscript denotes 
rms value of an alternating quantity, its Fourier 
transform, or its Laplace transform. In some 
cases, the capital subscript is used, as when 
referring to a circuit element to avoid confusion 
with nodes or terminals. Examples: Io, Vi(ω), 
IC(s), VTh(s).
•	 Capital letter with m subscript denotes the peak 
value of a sinusoidal quantity. Example: Im sin ωt.
•	 Lowercase letter with capital subscript denotes 
a total instantaneous quantity. Example: vSRC.
•	 Lowercase letter with lowercase subscript 
denotes a small signal of zero average value. 
Example: iy.
•	 Boldface, not italicized, symbol of voltage, cur-
rent, or power denotes a phasor. Example: Vb.
•	 Double subscript in a voltage symbol denotes 
a voltage drop from the node or terminal des-
ignated by the first subscript to the node or 
terminal designated by the second subscript. 
Example: Vab. Nodes or terminals are denoted 
by lowercase subscripts or numbers.
•	 Double subscript in a current symbol denotes 
a current flowing from the node or terminal 
designated by the first subscript to the node or 
terminal designated by the second subscript. 
Example: iab.
•	 Non-italic subscripts are used for denoting 
phases in three-phase systems, for “rms,” 
“max,” and “min” in subscripts.

Objective and Overview
This chapter introduces some basic notions on electric 
circuits before embarking on circuit analysis in the fol-
lowing chapters.
The chapter begins by explaining what electric circuits 
are, what they are used for, and what conservation laws 
they obey. The primary circuit variables of current and 
voltage are defined with reference to a useful and easy-
to-follow, hydraulic analogy. The significance of direc-
tion of current and polarity of voltage is emphasized 
because of the key roles these play in circuit analysis. 
The relation of current and voltage to power and energy 
is derived, and active and passive circuit elements are 
characterized by the way they handle energy. The three 
passive circuit parameters of resistance, capacitance, 
and inductance are justified as accounting for three 
basic attributes of the electromagnetic field, namely, 
energy dissipation and energy storage in the electric and 
magnetic fields. The chapter concludes with an exami-
nation of the idealizations and approximations made in 
the circuits approach.
1.1  What Are Electric Circuits 
and What Are They Used For?
Definition: An electric circuit is an interconnection of com-
ponents that affect electric charges in some characteristic 
manner.
An example is a battery connected to a heater 
through a switch, as illustrated diagrammatically in 
Figure 1.1. Figure 1.2 is the corresponding circuit dia-
gram in terms of symbols for the three components. 
When the switch is in the closed position, as shown, 
it allows electric charges to flow through the heater. 
In doing so, the charges impart some of their energy 
to the heater, thereby generating heat and raising the 
temperature of the heater metal. The battery restores 
energy to the electric charges, thereby allowing them 
to flow continuously through the circuit. Opening the 
switch interrupts the flow of charges and turns off the 
heater. Electrical installations in buildings provide 
many other examples of electric circuits, including 
lighting, air conditioning, alarm, and remote control 
systems. Electronic circuits, consisting of electrical and 
electronic components, are at the heart of electronic 
equipment of all kinds.
Electric circuits are used in two ways:
	
1.	To perform some useful task, as in the case of 
the heater of Figure 1.1 or in the case of elec-
trical installations in buildings or in the case of 
electronic equipment
	
2.	 To model or emulate the behavior of some com-
ponent or system, as explained in Section 1.8. 
The modeling is not restricted to electric or 
electronic components or systems but can be 
applied to mechanical, thermal, and fluidic 
systems.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
1.2  What Laws Govern the Behavior 
of Electric Circuits?
Concept: The behavior of electric circuits is governed by two 
fundamental conservation laws: conservation of energy and 
conservation of charge.
Energy is conserved in the sense that it can neither be 
created out of nothing nor be destroyed into nothing. It 
can only be converted from one form to another. A solar 
cell converts light energy to electric energy. An electric 
motor converts electric energy to mechanical energy. 
Strictly speaking, the universal conservation law is for 
mass + energy, but since conservation of mass does not 
play a role in the behavior of electric circuits, it is energy 
alone that is conserved.
Similarly, electric charges can be neither created nor 
destroyed. Materials or objects in their natural state are 
electrically neutral, that is, they contain equal quantities 
of positive and negative charges. These can be separated 
through expenditure of energy. In a battery, for example, 
energy-consuming reactions detach electrons from their 
parent atoms and raise their energies so that they flow 
through an external circuit connected to the battery. 
Because they are conserved, electric charges always flow in 
closed paths. If they did not flow in a closed path, then 
charges will start at a location where they are being cre-
ated and end up in a location where they are destroyed, 
in violation of conservation of charge.
In principle, it is possible to analyze the behavior of 
electric circuits in terms of energy and charge. However, 
this is seldom done in practice. It is much more con-
venient, as explained in Section 2.7, to analyze electric 
circuits using two common circuit variables, namely, 
electric current and voltage.
1.3  What Is Electric Current?
To explain the meaning of electric current, a useful 
hydraulic analogy can be invoked. Consider water flow-
ing down from a reservoir aboveground through some 
form of a water-driven turbine connected to a mechani-
cal load (Figure 1.3). A motor-driven pump recirculates 
the water from the turbine outlet back to the reservoir. 
The system of Figure 1.3 can be described as a “hydrau-
lic circuit” and is analogous to the electric circuit of 
Figures 1.1 and 1.2. The pump and reservoir are analo-
gous to the combination of battery and switch. The pump 
raises the potential energy of water and can be used to 
turn the flow on and off. The reservoir stores water at 
a higher potential energy with respect to ground level. 
As a power-consuming load, the turbine and its load are 
analogous to the heater. In flowing from the reservoir 
through the turbine, the potential energy of water is 
converted to kinetic energy, which in turn is converted 
by the turbine to mechanical energy. The pump, driven 
from a source of energy, such as the electricity supply 
or an internal combustion engine, utilizes this energy to 
raise the potential energy of the water back to the level 
of the reservoir.
A close analogy exists between the flow of water in 
Figure 1.3 and the flow of electric charge in Figure 1.2. 
More specifically, the volume of water that flows past a 
designated location in Figure 1.3, such as the outlet of 
the reservoir, over a specified interval is analogous to 
the quantity of charge that flows past a designated loca-
tion in Figure 1.2, such as a terminal of the battery, 
over the same interval. The rate of flow of water in the 
hydraulic case is analogous to the rate of flow of charge 
in the electric circuit. The rate of flow of electric charge 
is the value of the electric current, or simply the current. 
In general, current is defined as follows.
Definition: The current at any given point in an electric cir-
cuit and at a specified instant of time is the rate of flow of 
electric charge past the given point at that instant.
To express this relation quantitatively, the units of 
charge and current must be specified. The unit of charge 
in the standard SI (Système International, in French, 
Appendix A) units is the coulomb, denoted by the sym-
bol C, and the ­standard unit of current is the ampere, 
denoted by the symbol A, where a current of one ampere 
is a rate of flow of one coulomb per second.
If the flow of water in Figure 1.3 is steady, that is, it 
is not changing with time, the rate of flow is constant. 
Under these conditions, the volume of water that crosses 
any given location in the hydraulic circuit increases 
­linearly with time:

where the volume of flow is, say, in liters, the rate of 
flow is in liters/second, and time is in seconds.
Similarly, if the rate of flow of charge in the electric 
circuit of Figure 1.2 is steady, the current is constant, 
and the quantity of charge that crosses any given point 
in the circuit increases linearly with time, as illustrated 
in Figure 1.4a. A current that is constant with respect to 
time is a direct current, or dc current.
In general, the rate of flow of charge may vary with 
time, in which case an instantaneous current is defined 
at any particular instant of time as the slope of the charge 
vs. time graph at that instant. That is,
	
i
dq
dt
=
	
(1.2)
In Figure 1.4b, for example, where q is shown to vary 
arbitrarily with time, the current i1 at the instant of time t1 
is the slope, dq/dt, of the q vs. t graph at t = t1. In Figure 1.4a, 
the slope is constant and is equal to the dc current I.
By convention, dc currents are denoted by italic ­capital 
letters and instantaneous currents by italic small letters, 
with capital subscripts in both cases, as may be required 
(Convention for Voltage and Current  Symbols, p. xxxi). 
Thus, IO and ISRC are dc currents, whereas iO and iSRC are 
instantaneous currents.
1.4  What Is the Direction of Current?
Convention: It is assumed in circuit analysis that the 
­direction of current is the same as that of the flow of positive 
electric charges. This assigned positive direction is indicated 
by an arrow associated with the current symbol.
The reason for this convention is purely historical. 
It was postulated in the eighteenth century at a time 
when the nature of current carriers was not known. 
By current carriers is meant the charges whose rate of 
flow equals the current. It is now known that in most 
­metals, current carriers are primarily negative charges, 
in the form of conduction electrons, that is, electrons 
that have detached from their parent atoms and are free 
to move under the influence of an applied electric field. 
In semiconductors and some metals, current carriers can 
be what are effectively positive charges, or holes, as they 
are called. In a conducting liquid, or electrolyte, cur-
rent carriers are positively charged ions and negatively 
charged ions. In a gas, current carriers are positively 
charged ions, negatively charged ions, or electrons. 
Nevertheless, the convention in circuit analysis is that 
the direction of current is that of the flow of assumed posi-
tive electric charges, irrespective of the sign of the charges that 
actually carry the current. This is convenient and does not 
cause any confusion if applied consistently. If negatively 
charged current carriers flow in a given direction, then 
we can simply consider the current to be due to an equal 
flow of positive charges in the direction opposite to that 
of the flow of the negatively charged current carriers. 
This is explained more fully in Example 1.1.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, it will henceforth 
be assumed that current carriers are positive charges and 
that the direction of current is that of the flow of positive 
electric charges, as indicted in Figure 1.2. It should be 
emphasized that current always has a direction, just as 
hydraulic flow has a direction. It is meaningless to specify 
a current without indicating its direction.
Example 1.1:  Steady Flow of Electric Charges

ously in the positive x-direction in a conducting medium

	 (a)	 According to the discussion of Section 1.3, q is the 
quantity of charge that flows past a specified loca-
tion in the pathway of flow, such as the plane xx′ 
in Figure 1.5 and in Figure 1.6a. If the rate of flow 
is constant at 0.5 C/s, then q increases linearly with 
time, that is, q = 0.5t, in accordance with Equation 
1.1 and as illustrated in Figure 1.4a. According to 
Equation 1.2, the current is constant and is equiva-
lent to a dc current of Ipx+ = dq/dt = 0.5 A. Its direc-
tion is that of the flow of positive charge, that is, 
in the positive x-direction, as indicated by the cur-
rent arrow in Figure 1.6a. To convert this current to 
mA, it is multiplied by the number of mA in 1 A, 
which is 103. Thus, Ipx+ = (0.5 A) × mA/A. The ‘A’ 
unit cancels out, giving Ipx+ = 0.5 × 103 ≡ 500 mA.
	 (b)	 Let the required current in the positive x-­direction, 
due to positive charges flowing in the nega-
tive x-direction, be denoted as Ipx− (Figure  1.6b). 
Suppose we add to this flow another flow of posi-
tive charges in the positive x-direction at a con-
stant rate of 0.5 C/s, equivalent to the current Ipx+ 
(Figure 1.6b). As a result, there is no net flow of 
charge in either direction past the reference loca-
tion  xx′ in Figure 1.6b. This means that q is zero 
and the total current in the positive x-direction is 
zero. That is, Ipx+ + Ipx− = 0 so that Ipx− = −Ipx+. In 
other words, the current in the positive x-direction 
due to positive charges moving in the negative 
x-direction at a constant rate of 0.5 C/s is −0.5 A.
	 (c)	 Let the required current in the positive x-­
direction due to the flow of negative charges in 
this direction be denoted as Inx+ (Figure 1.6c). 
Suppose that we add to this flow an equal flow 
of positive charges also in the positive x-­direction 
at the same rate of 0.5 C/s, ­equivalent to the cur-
rent Ipx+ (Figure 1.6c). It can now be argued that 
the equal quantities of positive and negative 
charges ­flowing in the same direction at equal 
rates will completely neutralize one another. This 
means that there will be no net flow of charge in 
either direction past the reference location  xx′ in 
Figure  1.6c. The total current is therefore zero. 
That is, Ipx+ + Inx+ = 0 so that Inx+ = −Ipx+. In other 
words, the current due to the flow of negative 
charges in the positive x-direction at a constant 
rate of 0.5 C/s is −0.5 A.
The three currents are indicated in Figure 1.6d. The 
­following should be noted:
	
1.	In terms of assignment in the positive x-­direction, 
Ipx+, Ipx−, and Inx+ are all in the same direction, as 
symbols. But in terms of numerical values, Ipx+ has 
a positive value, whereas Ipx− and Inx+ have nega-
tive values. This means that the conventional 
current, due to the flow of positive  charges, 
is in the positive x-direction in the case of Ipx+ 
and in the negative x-direction in the  case of 
Ipx− and Inx+.
	
2.	Both Ipx− and Inx+ have been arbitrarily assigned a 
positive direction in the positive x-direction, as stip-
ulated in this example. Had they been assigned a 
positive direction in the negative x-direction, the 
current values of Ipx− and Inx+ would be +0.5  A 
instead of −0.5 A.
Alternatively, it could be argued that q in case (a) is 
due to the movement of positive charge in the posi-
tive x-­direction, which makes q positive. By the same 
token, q in both cases (b) and (c) is negative. According

to Equation  1.2, the value of the resulting current is 
negative so that the currents Ipx− and Inx+ have negative 
values.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Always check the units on both sides of an equa-
tion, and always specify the units of the results of 
calculations.
Primal Exercise 1.1
What is the current in the positive x-direction in the 
­preceding example if negative charges move in the neg-
ative x-direction at a constant rate of 0.5 C/s?
Ans. 0.5 A.
Since i is the slope of the q vs. t graph, in accordance 
with Equation 1.2, it follows from this equation that
	
q
idt
=ò
	
(1.3)
In other words, q is the area under the i vs. t graph. 
In Figure 1.7a, for example, q increases linearly from 0 at 
t = 0 to a peak value of 6 μC at t = 1 ms and then decreases 
linearly back to zero at t = 1.5 ms. The current, being the 
slope of the q vs. t graph, is constant at a positive value 
of 6 μC/1 ms, or 6 mA, during the interval from 0 to 1 ms 
(Figure 1.7b). The current then reverses direction and 
becomes −6 μC/0.5 ms = −12 mA during the interval from 
1 to 1.5 ms. The current returns to zero at t = 1.5 ms. The 
area under the i vs. t graph increases linearly from zero at 
t = 0 and reaches a peak value of 6 mA × 1 ms = 6 μC at 
t = 1 ms. The area is negative during the interval from 1 to 
1.5 ms and subtracts from the positive area. At t = 1.5 ms, 
the positive and negative areas are equal in magnitude 
so that the net area is zero, corresponding to a q of zero 
at t > 1.5 ms. The negative current is in a direction oppo-
site to that of the positive current so that at t = 1.5 ms as 
much charge has flowed in one direction as in the oppo-
site direction, and the net flow of charge is zero.
Primal Exercise 1.2
Rework the example of Figure 1.7, assuming that the 
charge increases linearly from zero to 15 mC in 0.5 ms 
and then decreases linearly to zero at t = 2 ms.
Ans. i = 30 A, 0 < t < 0.5 ms, and i = −10 A, 0.5 < t < 2 ms.
Primal Exercise 1.3
The current i through a device varies with time as 
shown in Figure 1.8. Determine the charge that passes 
through the device between t = 0 and t = 1.25 s in the 
direction of i.
Ans. 0.75 C.
★Example 1.2:  Time-Varying Flow of Electric Charges
Suppose that the flow of charge is given by q = (1 – cost) C, 
0 ≤ t ≤ 2π s, as illustrated in Figure 1.9a. It is required to

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Analysis: Recall that q is the quantity of charge that flows 
past an arbitrary location xx′ in the positive x-direction 
between a time t = 0 and a time t > 0.
	 1.	 0 ≤ t ≤ π/2 s: Charge starts to flow at t = 0 in the 
positive x-direction and q increases with time 
(Figures  1.9a and 1.10a). The rate of flow, equal 
to the slope dq/dt of the q vs. t graph, is the cur-
rent i, where i = dq/dt = sint increases from 0 at t = 0 
to a maximum positive value of 1  A at t  =  π/2  s 
(Figure 1.9b). The direction of i is that of the flow, 
that is, in the positive x-direction.
	 2.	 π/2 ≤ t < π s: Charge continues to flow in the posi-
tive x-direction, and q continues to increase, but 
at a decreasing rate of flow, so dq/dt decreases in 
magnitude but remains positive. Current continues 
to be in the positive x-direction but its magnitude 
decreases from its maximum positive value of +1 A 
toward zero (Figures 1.9b and 1.10a).
	 3.	 t = π s: The flow stops momentarily, dq/dt = i = 0 
(Figures 1.9b and 1.10b), and q reaches its maximum 
value of 2 C. The maximum quantity of charge has 
passed xx′ in the positive x-direction.
	 4.	 π < t ≤ 3π/2 s: q decreases, which means that charge 
now flows in the negative x-direction so as to reduce 
the net quantity of charge that has flowed in the posi-
tive x-direction past xx′ (Figure 1.10c). The magni-
tude of the rate of flow in the negative x-direction, 
|dq/dt|, increases with time, reaching a maximum 
at t = 3π/2 s. Since dq/dt is negative, the current is in 
the negative x-direction and its magnitude increases 
to a maximum of 1 A at t = 3π/2 s (Figure 1.9b).
	 5.	 3π/2 ≤ t < 2π s: Charge continues to flow in the nega-
tive x-direction but at a decreasing magnitude of the 
rate of flow. The current continues to be in the nega-
tive x-direction but its magnitude decreases from 
its maximum positive value of +1  A toward zero 
(Figures 1.9b and 1.10c).
	 6.	 t = 2π s: q is back to zero, which means that as much 
charge has flowed in the negative x-direction past 
xx′ as has flowed in the positive x-direction. Since 
dq/dt = 0 at this instant, i = 0.
q starts at zero at t = 0 and ends at zero at t = 2π s, which 
means that a quantity of charge moves in the positive 
x-direction past xx′ during the time between t = 0 and 
t = π s, and this same quantity moves back in the negative 
x-direction between t = π and t = 2π s. Because there is no 
net flow of charge in the negative x-direction at any time, 
q does not go negative. There is current during charge 
movement, the current i having a positive value when 
charge moves in the positive x-­direction and a negative 
value when charge moves in the positive x-direction.
Note that the arrow associated with i in Figure 1.10 is 
in the positive x-direction, which means that the assigned 
positive direction of i is in the positive x-direction. 
However, i has a positive value when positive charges 
flow in the positive x-direction and a negative value 
when positive charges flow in the negative x-direction.
The area under the i vs. t graph increases from zero at 
t = 0 and reaches a maximum at t = π, in accordance with 
the q graph. As t increases beyond π, a negative area is 
added to the positive area of the positive half-cycle of i, 
so the net positive area decreases and becomes zero at 
t = 2π s, when q is zero again.
★Example 1.3:  Expression for Current 
through a Conducting Medium
Consider a conducting medium of cross-sectional area 
A  m2 through which positively charged particles are 
flowing, as illustrated in Figure 1.5 and reproduced 
in Figure 1.11. The concentration of particles is n par-
ticles/m3, each particle having a charge e C and mov-
ing at a constant speed of u m/s. It is required to (a) 
derive an expression for the current I flowing through 
the conductor and (b) determine I if n = 105 particles/
cm3, A = 1 cm2, e = ±1 μC, and u = ±10 cm/s, consider-
ing all possible sign combinations.

Note that “particle” and “m3” cancel out in the

charge C on the right-hand-side (RHS). In a time 
dt, the charges move a distance dx  =  udt so that 
all the charge dq enclosed by the disk will move 
past the plane  xx′. The charge that moves past the 
plane  xx′ per second is dq/dt. Dividing both sides

particle)(10 × 10−2 m/s) = 1 A.​ The positive numerical 
value of I is in accordance with the convention that if 
positive electric charges flow in the positive x-direc-
tion, the conventional direction of current is also in 
the positive x-­direction. If positive electric charges 
flow at a constant rate in the negative x-direction 
and u = −10 cm/s, I = 1 × 105 × 10−6 × (−10) = −1 A. 
The negative value of I signifies that the current is 
in the negative x-direction, as expected. If the par-
ticles are negatively charged, that is, e = −1 μC, and 
u = 10 cm/s, I = 1 × 105 × (−10−6) × (10) = −1 A. This 
is in accordance with the conclusion in Example 1.1, 
part (c), that if negative electric charges flow in the 
positive x-direction, the current is in the negative 
x-­direction. Finally, if both e and u are negative, then 
the current is in the positive x-direction.
★ Exercise 1.4
The concentration of conduction electrons in a 1  mm 
diameter copper wire is 8.4  ×  1028 electrons/m3, the 
charge of an electron being −1.6  ×  10−19 C. Determine 
the current if the net velocity of electrons in the positive 
x-direction is 0.02 cm/s. What is the direction of current?
Ans. −2.11  A, the negative sign indicating that the 
­current is in the negative x-direction.
1.5  What Is Voltage?
Consider a volume Λ of water at a height h aboveground, 
where h is measured between the ground and the center 
of mass of Λ (Figure 1.12a). The potential energy of this 
volume of water with respect to the assumed ground 
level is
	
PE = (

Lr hg	
(1.6)
where 
ρ is the density of water so that Λρ is the mass of the 
volume Λ of water
g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2 at sea 
level)

through the height h. The work could be used to per-
form some useful task, such as driving a turbine, as in 
Figure 1.3.
In a similar manner, a quantity of charge +q, analogous 
to the volume Λ, located close to a positively charged 
body ‘A’ of charge +Q and some distance away from a 
negatively charged body ‘B’, of charge −Q, possesses 
electric potential energy (Figure 1.12b). The reason for 
this electric potential energy is that work must be done 
in bringing +q close to the positively charged body ‘A’, 
against the repulsion by this body and the attraction by 
the negatively charged body ‘B’. This work is stored as 
potential energy in the system. If unconstrained, the 
charge +q will move away from ‘A’ toward ‘B’, because 
of the repulsion by ‘A’ and the attraction by ‘B’. Similarly, 
the volume of water Λ, if unconstrained, will fall toward 
ground level under the influence of gravity. In both cases, 
unconstrained Λ and +q move from a region of higher 
potential energy to a region of lower potential energy 
and can do useful work in the process through conver-
sion of the loss of potential energy to another form of 
energy. Dividing the electric potential energy of a given 
charge by the charge gives a quantity denoted as voltage 
and is analogous to the pressure ρhg in the case of water.
Definition: The voltage between two points is the change in 
electric potential energy of a charged particle as it moves from 
one of these points to the other, divided by the charge of the 
particle.
The unit of voltage in SI units is the volt, denoted 
by the symbol V, and is such that if a particle having a 
charge of +1 C moves down a voltage of 1 V, it loses 1 J 
of electric potential energy.
Equation 1.6 can be more generally expressed as a 
product:
	
Gravitational potential energy difference between 
two points
Volume Pressure difference 
between the two points
=
´
	
By analogy,
	
Electric potential energy difference between 
two points

It follows that if a particle of charge +1 C moves 
through a voltage difference v V, the change in electric 
potential energy (PE) of the particle is directly propor-
tional to the voltage difference, that is, change in PE = 
(1 C) × (v V) = v J; if a particle of charge δq C moves 
through a voltage difference v V, the change in potential 
energy of the particle is also directly proportional to the 
charge of the particle, that is, δw = vδq, or v = δw/δq. In 
the limit, as δq approaches zero,
	
v
dw
dq
=
	
(1.8)
If w varies linearly with q, such as w = kq, where k is 
a constant, then dw/dq = w/q = k. If, however, w var-
ies nonlinearly with q, as for q vs. t in Figure 1.4b, then 
Equation 1.8 defines v at a particular value of q in this 
more general case.
If a particle of charge +q C moves to a point that is v V 
higher in voltage, it gains qv J in potential energy, and 
the voltage is (+qv J)/(+q) = v V. On the other hand, if 
a particle of charge −q C moves to a point v V higher in 
voltage, it loses qv J in potential energy. The change in 
potential energy is Δw = (final PE – initial PE) = −qv J, 
and the voltage is (−qv J)/(−q) = v V, independent of the 
sign of the charge.
A voltage that is constant with respect to time is a dc 
voltage; dc voltages are denoted by italic capital letters 
and instantaneous voltages by italic small letters, with 
capital subscripts in both cases, as may be required. 
Thus, VO and VSRC are dc voltages, whereas vO and vSRC 
are instantaneous voltages.
Potential energy is expressed with respect to some 
chosen reference that is assigned an arbitrary value, 
usually zero. For example, gravitational poten-
tial energy may be expressed relative to a reference 
value of zero at sea level. Similarly, voltage is always 
expressed with respect to some reference, usually that 
of the earth, which is assigned a voltage of zero. In 
electric circuits, what is of interest is the voltage dif-
ference between two points in the circuit. A battery 
voltage of 3 V, for example, means that the voltage dif-
ference between the positive and negative terminals of 
the battery is 3 V. It is meaningless in an electric circuit to 
speak of the voltage at a certain point without specifying the 
point with respect to which this voltage is assigned. When 
the circuit is connected to ground at some point, this is 
indicated by the ground symbol shown in Figure 1.13a, 
as in PSpice. If the circuit is not grounded, the refer-
ence point for voltages in the circuit is commonly indi-
cated by the triangle symbol shown in Figure 1.13b. 
Table 1.1 lists the electrical quantities discussed so far 
and their counterparts in the hydraulic analogy.

1.6  What Is Voltage Polarity?
Just as current has direction, voltage, or more correctly 
the voltage difference between two points, has a polarity 
that indicates which of the two points is at a more posi-
tive voltage with respect to the other point. In the case of 
a battery, for example, the positive (+) and negative (−) 
terminals are marked on the battery in some appropri-
ate manner. Similarly in an electric circuit, a plus sign 
next to a point and a minus sign next to another point, 
as in Figure 1.14, indicate that point ‘a’, having the + 
sign, is assigned a more positive voltage than point ‘b’ 
having the − sign. Again, it is meaningless to specify a volt-
age between two points in a circuit, such as vX in Figure 1.14 
without indicating the polarity or direction of the voltage. vX 
in Figure 1.14 is assigned the positive polarity indicated. 
According to this assignment, then in going from ‘a’ to 
‘b’, a voltage drop vX is encountered, whereas in going 
from ‘b’ to ‘a’, a voltage rise vX is encountered. If the 
numerical value of vX is a positive number, point ‘a’ is 
in fact positive with respect to point ‘b’. If the numerical 
value of vX is a negative number, point ‘b’ is in fact posi-
tive with respect to point ‘a’.
Primal Exercise 1.5
Assume that vX = −5 V in Figure 1.14. (a) In which direc-
tion is the actual voltage drop, and (b) in which direction 
is the actual voltage rise?
Ans. (a) Actual voltage drop from ‘b’ to ‘a’; (b) actual 
voltage rise from ‘a’ to ‘b’.
Primal Exercise 1.6
(a) If a charge of +0.1 C moves to a point that is 3  V 
higher in voltage, by how much does its electric poten-
tial energy increase or decrease? (b) If a charge of −0.2 C 
moves to a point that is 5 V higher in voltage, by how 
much does its electric potential energy increase or 
decrease? (c) Are the movements in (a) and (b) those of 
an unconstrained particle, or do they require expendi-
ture of energy on the particle?
Ans. (a) Electric potential energy of the particle increases 
by 0.3  J; (b) electric potential energy of the particle 
decreases by 1 J; (c) energy is expended on the particle in 
(a), whereas the motion in (b) is that of an unconstrained 
particle.
1.7  How Are Energy and Power Related 
to Voltage and Current?
It is seen from the preceding discussion that current car-
riers can possess two types of energy: potential energy 
that depends on the voltage and kinetic energy that 
depends on the current, that is, the rate of flow of the 
carriers, and hence their velocity. More will be said 
about this in future chapters.

with v in volts and i in amperes, p in Equation 1.10 is in 
joules per second, or watts, denoted by the symbol W. 
The physical interpretation of Equation 1.10 is that a 
current of i A represents a flow of charge of i C/s. As 
each 1  C moves through a voltage difference v V, its 
electric potential energy changes by v J/C. The change 
in electric potential energy of the total charge in J/s is 
(v J/C) × i(C/s) = vi J/s, which is the power in watts.
What does conservation of energy in a circuit mean? 
It means that at any instant of time, the total energy 
delivered by sources of energy in the circuit, such as 
batteries, must be equal to the total energy absorbed in 
energy-absorbing elements in the circuit, such as heat-
ing ­elements or lamps:

Otherwise, if the energy delivered at any instant of 
time exceeds, say, that absorbed, then at least in prin-
ciple, the system can be stopped at that instant, result-
ing in an excess of energy delivered over that absorbed. 
This means that energy can be extracted from the sys-
tem at no energy cost, which violates conservation of 
energy.
Conservation of energy implies conservation of power. For 
if the power delivered or absorbed during a time inter-
val Δt is p, the corresponding energy is pΔt. Substituting

Power is conserved in the circuit as a whole at every

Example 1.4:  Power Delivered or Absorbed
Assume that the lamp in Figure 1.15 is rated at 0.75 W, 
3 V, that is, it absorbs 0.75 W when a voltage of 3 V is 
impressed across its terminals. This is the total power 
that is converted primarily to light but also to some heat 
that is inevitably generated in the process. It is required 
to determine (a) the current through the lamp and its 
direction based on power absorption, (b) the power 
delivered by the battery, and (c) the direction of current 
through the battery based on power delivery.
Solution:
	 (a)	 Since terminals ‘a’ and ‘b’ of the battery are directly 
connected to terminals a′ and b′ of the lamp, respec-
tively, by a wiring connection, the voltage across 
the lamp is also 3 V, the same as the battery voltage. 
Because the lamp absorbs 0.75 W, it follows from 
Equation 1.10 that I = (0.75 W)/(3 V) = 0.25 A. The 
direction of I is that of the voltage drop from a’ to 
b’ because power absorption by the lamp implies 
that the assumed positive charges that carry I lose 
energy as they flow through the lamp. They must 
therefore flow through the lamp from terminal a’ 
that is at a higher voltage to terminal b’ that is at a 
lower voltage.
	 (b)	 By conservation of power in the circuit as a whole, 
the battery must deliver 0.75 W, neglecting the insig-
nificant power dissipated in the connecting wires 
between ‘a’ and a′ and between ‘b’ and b′. Power dis-
sipation in the connecting wires is always neglected 
in electric circuits, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
	 (c)	 As the assumed positive charges that carry I flow 
through the battery, they must regain the energy 
that was lost in flowing through the lamp. Hence, 
they must flow in the battery from the negatively 
charged terminal toward the positively charged 
terminal, that is, in the direction of a voltage rise 
through the battery.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Always mark on the circuit diagram the directions 
of all currents and the polarities of all voltages.
The argument made in the preceding example concern-
ing power absorption and delivery underlies an impor-
tant, general concept, usually referred to as the passive 
sign convention:
Concept: If power is absorbed in a given circuit element, or 
component, current flows through that element in the direc-
tion of a voltage drop across the terminals of the given ele-
ment, whereas if power is delivered by a given circuit element, 
current flows through that element in the direction of a volt-
age rise across the terminals of the given element.
The physical justification is simply that positive 
charges flowing through a circuit element, or com-
ponent, in the direction of a voltage drop lose electric 
potential energy as they flow through the element, as 
illustrated in Figure 1.16a. This loss of energy implies 
absorption of power in the circuit element. Conversely, 
positive charges flowing through a circuit element in 
the direction of a voltage rise (Figure 1.16b) gain electric 
potential energy as they flow through the element. This 
gain of energy implies delivery of power by the circuit 
element to the rest of the circuit.

1.7.1  Positive and Negative Values 
of Circuit Variables
It will be seen in future chapters that before a circuit is 
analyzed, it is necessary to assign voltages and currents in 
various parts of the circuit, even though the actual direc-
tions of these voltages and currents are not yet known. 
What is done, therefore, is that the directions of these volt-
ages and currents are assigned arbitrarily, using appropri-
ate symbols, and subject to constraints imposed by circuit 
laws and the v–i relations of the circuit elements, as will be 
explained later. After the circuit is analyzed, if the numer-
ical value of a given voltage or current is positive, then the 
actual direction of that voltage or current is the same as 
that assumed. On the other hand, if the numerical value 
of a given voltage or current is negative, the actual direc-
tion of that voltage or current is opposite to that assumed. 
Hence, negative values of voltages and currents are per-
fectly natural in electric circuits. This notion is not at all 
unusual. Suppose, for example, that the voltage of a bat-
tery needs to be measured but the battery terminals are 
unmarked. In this case, the positive lead of a voltmeter is 
connected arbitrarily to one of the battery terminals and 
the negative lead of the voltmeter to the other terminal 
of the battery. If the voltmeter reads a positive voltage, 
the positive terminal of the battery is that connected to 
the positive lead of the voltmeter. If the voltmeter reads 
a negative voltage, the positive terminal of the battery is 
that connected to the negative lead of the voltmeter.
Similarly, a negative value of power absorbed by a given 
element means that this element actually delivers power, 
and a negative value of delivered power by a given ele-
ment means that this element actually absorbs power.
To summarize, consider Figure 1.17a, which shows 
the assigned positive direction of current IA through an 
element ‘A’, and the assigned positive polarity of the 
voltage VA across ‘A’. IA is arbitrarily assigned in the 
direction of a voltage drop VA. The implication is that 
in the expression for power, PA = VAIA, positive values 
of VA and IA make PA positive. Since IA is in the direction 
of a voltage drop VA, then in accordance with the pas-
sive sign convention and its physical interpretation, a 
positive PA is power absorbed by ‘A’. Thus, if IA = 2 A 
and VA = 9 V (Figure 1.17b), then PA = +18 W of power 
absorbed by ‘A’. On the other hand, if either VA = −9 V or 
IA = −2 A (Figure 1.17c and d), then the power absorbed 
by ‘A’ is PA = −18 W, which means that ‘A’ actually deliv-
ers 18 W, since the power absorbed is negative.
On the other hand, suppose that the assigned positive 
direction of IA is reversed to that of a voltage rise across 
‘A’ (Figure 1.18a). Then a positive value of PA = VAIA is 
power delivered, in accordance with the passive sign con-
vention and its physical interpretation. Thus, if IA = 2 A 
and VA = 9 V (Figure 1.18b), then PA = +18 W is power 
delivered by ‘A’. On the other hand, if either VA = −9 V 
or IA = −2 A (Figure 1.18c and d), then the power deliv-
ered by ‘A’ is PA = −18 W, which means that ‘A’ actually 
absorbs 18 W, since the power delivered is negative.

1.8  What Are Ideal Circuit Elements 
and How Do They Handle Energy?
In circuit analysis, a fundamental conceptual step of great 
importance is taken, namely, that of representing physical 
or “practical” electric components, such as the battery and 
heater in Figure 1.2, in terms of a limited set of idealized, 
or “abstract”, circuit elements. These ideal circuit ele-
ments can be divided into two general categories, active 
and passive, depending on how they handle energy.
Definition: Active circuit elements are capable of delivering 
energy to an electric circuit through conversion of energy, ulti-
mately from some nonelectrical source of energy. Passive circuit 
elements are incapable of doing so.
The battery in Figure 1.2 can be represented by an 
active circuit element because it delivers energy to the 
heater through conversion of the energy of chemical 
reactions to electric energy. A solar cell or an electro-
mechanical generator can be represented by an active 
circuit element because they convert solar energy and 
mechanical energy, respectively, to electric energy. All 
these active circuit elements can be represented using 
ideal sources, as discussed in detail in Chapter 2.
On the other hand, passive circuit elements are inca-
pable of delivering energy in an electric circuit through 
conversion from another source of energy. Instead, they 
can absorb energy for one of the following purposes:
	
1.	Energy consumption or conversion of energy in 
the  electric circuit to nonelectric energy, which 
could be, for example, heat, light, sound, or 
mechanical energy. Energy-consuming devices 
can often be conveniently represented in electric 
circuits by ideal resistors, which dissipate electric 
energy as heat, as in the case of the heater in Figure 
1.2. The property that allows a resistor to dissipate 
energy is the resistance, denoted by the symbol R.
	
2.	Temporary storage in the form of electric energy or, 
more specifically, potential energy of current car-
riers. The circuit element that stores this energy 
is an ideal capacitor, and the property associated 
with this electric energy storage is the capaci-
tance, denoted by the symbol C (note that italic C 
is capacitance, whereas nonitalic C is coulomb).
	
3.	Temporary storage in the form of magnetic 
energy or, more specifically, kinetic energy of 
current carriers. The circuit element that stores 
this energy is an ideal inductor, and the prop-
erty associated with this magnetic energy stor-
age is the inductance, denoted by the symbol L.
Resistance, capacitance, and inductance are referred 
to as circuit parameters. Figure 1.21 illustrates the clas-
sification of the ideal circuit elements, and the circuit 
symbols for an ideal resistor, capacitor, and inductor. 
The designation “circuit element” will henceforth exclu-
sively refer to an ideal circuit element.
The three passive circuit elements are “ideal” in the 
following respects:
	
1.	Each element performs its designated function 
only. Thus, ideal resistors only dissipate energy.

They neither store electric energy nor store mag-
netic energy. Ideal capacitors only store electric 
energy. They neither dissipate energy nor store 
magnetic energy. Ideal inductors only store mag-
netic energy. They neither dissipate energy nor 
store electric energy. Practical circuit elements 
are not ideal in this sense. For example, a practi-
cal inductor made from a coil of wire dissipates 
energy because of the finite resistance of the wire. 
Moreover and because the function performed 
by each of the ideal ­passive circuit elements is of 
a fundamentally different nature from that per-
formed by the other two elements, none of the 
three ideal circuit elements can be represented 
in terms of the other two. In this sense, the ideal 
circuit elements are also described as basic.
	
2.	The circuit parameters R, L, and C in a given 
circuit are constant, independent of any current 
or voltage with which they are associated, and 
are also independent of time. It will be shown 
later that the constancy of R, L, and C implies 
linearity of the governing relations for these 
elements. Because of this, basic electric circuits 
comprising ideal circuit elements are referred to 
as ­linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits.
It is quite legitimate to question the usefulness of work-
ing with such ideal elements. The justification is that 
consideration of idealized models is a central first step in 
the engineering approach, which has proved so success-
ful in advancing technology. These idealized models, or 
“equivalent circuits”, as they are often referred to in elec-
trical engineering, employ ideal elements to reproduce, 
as a first approximation, the essential behavior of the 
system under consideration, without extraneous details 
that would otherwise hamper unnecessarily the analy-
sis of system behavior. This is the second application of 
electric circuits mentioned in Section 1.1. For example, 
if we are only interested in the current and power in the 
circuit of Figure 1.15, we need not consider the chemi-
cal reactions in the battery, nor the electric field inside 
the battery and how it varies from one terminal to the 
other, nor the internal resistance or the opposition to the 
flow of current carriers through the battery, etc. As a first 
approximation, we can simply represent the battery as 
an ideal voltage source of the same voltage as that mea-
sured between the terminals of the battery. Similarly, if 
the lamp is a light-emitting diode (LED), we need not 
consider how light is produced in the semiconductor, 
nor the intensity of the light and its spectral distribution, 
nor the heat generated in the process, etc. As a power-
absorbing device, the LED may be replaced by an ideal 
resistor that absorbs the same power.
Such idealized models may be used to investigate and 
improve the behavior of the system under consideration. 
If a model does not reproduce the actual behavior of the 
system accurately enough under certain conditions, it is 
refined in order to do so. For example, the resistance of a 
practical inductor can be accounted for, at low frequen-
cies, by adding an ideal resistor; a practical transformer 
or an operational amplifier can be represented by equiv-
alent circuits composed of ideal circuit elements, and 
the behavior of circuits that include these elements can 
be analyzed using their equivalent circuits, as will be 
discussed in future chapters. These equivalent circuits 
can be modified to account for various imperfections in 
transformers or operational amplifiers or to emulate the 
behavior of these components at high ­frequencies, for 
example.
It is seen that the study of circuits composed of ideal 
circuit elements is a crucial first step in understanding 
the behavior of various electrical and electronic systems. 
This will be our main concern in this book. Such under-
standing is essential for designing systems that perform 
desired tasks and for improving the performance of 
these systems.
★1.9  Why Resistance, Capacitance, 
and Inductance?
This section explains the significance of the three circuit 
parameters in terms of fundamental attributes of the 
electromagnetic field.
Fundamentally, an electric field is associated with 
electric charges at rest or in motion, and a magnetic 
field is associated with moving electric charges, that is, 
electric current. A rigorous analysis of systems involv-
ing electric charges and currents should therefore be 
­carried out in terms of electromagnetic fields. This, how-
ever, is a daunting task even for relatively simple cases. 
Circuit analysis provides a much easier but nevertheless 
approximate solution that is adequate for a great num-
ber of cases encountered in practice. The nature of these 
approximations is examined in the following section.
If circuit analysis is to solve some electromagnetic 
­problems, even in an approximate manner, it must 
account for some basic attributes of electromagnetic 
fields. Once launched by some source of electro-
magnetic energy, the electromagnetic field has three 
basic attributes, namely, (1) energy dissipation due to 
energy losses in the medium through which the field 
­propagates; (2) electric energy stored in the electric 
component of the electromagnetic field, which repre-
sents the energy expended in establishing the electric 
field; and (3) magnetic energy stored in the magnetic 
component of the electromagnetic field, which repre-
sents the energy expended in establishing the magnetic 
field. In an electric circuit, these three attributes can be 
accounted for, respectively, by the circuit parameters of 

16

resistance, capacitance, and inductance. This implies 
that an ­electrical or electronic component or system can 
be represented, or modeled, by means of an appropriate 
electric circuit that includes these elements.
★1.10  What Are the Approximations 
Implicit in Basic Electric Circuits?
This section explains the nature of two main approxima-
tions implicit in basic electric circuits, when modeling 
physical systems, namely, the lumped-parameter repre-
sentation and the neglect of wave propagation in a circuit.
In order to appreciate the nature of the approximations 
implicit in basic electric circuits, consider a cylindrical 
rod of resistive material, one end of which is connected 
to a battery of voltage VB and the other end connected to 
ground (Figure 1.22a). A current I flows under the influ-
ence of the battery voltage. The hydraulic analogy is a 
narrow pipe through which water is driven. One end 
of the pipe is connected to a pump, the other end of the 
pipe being open to the atmosphere, above an open reser-
voir, say. The pipe would present considerable resistance 
to water flow because of friction, mainly between water 
and the inner walls of the pipe. Hence, the pump applies 
some hydraulic pressure at one end of the pipe in order 
to overcome this friction and drive water through the 
pipe. The pressure applied by the pump is analogous 
to the battery voltage, and the friction along the pipe is 
analogous to the resistance along the rod, this resistance 
being uniformly distributed along the length of the rod. 
The energy applied by the pump to overcome friction 
is analogous to the energy delivered by the battery to 
overcome the resistance of the rod. The power input to 
the rod is p = VBI and is dissipated as heat in the rod.
Just as the pressure drops along the pipe, from that 
established by the pump at one end to zero at the open 
end, the voltage along the rod, with respect to ground, 
drops from VB at one end of the rod to zero at the end 
connected to ground. Associated with this voltage is an 
electric field between the rod and ground that progres-
sively decreases with the voltage along the rod, as illus-
trated in Figure 1.22a. The energy stored in the electric 
field between the rod and ground can be represented in 
circuit terms by a capacitance that is distributed along 
the rod. There will also be some energy in the electric 
field due to the voltage drop along the rod itself, but 
this can be generally neglected compared to the energy 
stored in the electric field between the rod and ground 
when the voltage drop along the rod is not too large.
In addition, there will be a magnetic field along the 
length of the rod due to the current I, as illustrated in 
Figure 1.22b. The energy stored in the magnetic field can 
be represented in circuit terms by an inductance that is 
uniformly distributed along the rod. The question arises 
as to how can the distributed resistance, capacitance, 
and inductance be represented along the rod and taken 
into consideration when analyzing the flow of current 
through the rod.
Mathematically, an infinitesimal length dx of the 
rod can be considered to have infinitesimal resistance, 
inductance, and capacitance (Figure 1.23a). A differ-
ential equation is then written for current or voltage 
and the system analyzed accordingly. However, this 
is rather complicated, because the resulting differen-
tial equation is a partial differential equation involv-
ing both time and distance. Hence, this approach is 
not used in basic circuit analysis but is used in more 
advanced treatments, as in the case of transmission 
lines and waveguides. Instead, the rod can be divided 
into a number of segments, say, three, and each segment

is represented by a lumped resistance, capacitance, and 
inductance representing, respectively, the total power 
dissipation, the total energy stored in the electric field, 
and the total energy stored in the magnetic field, in each 
segment (Figure 1.23b). Because of this lumping, rep-
resentations such as that of Figure 1.23b are referred 
to as lumped-parameter representations. This is in 
contrast to distributed-parameter representations that 
take into account the distributed nature of resistance, 
capacitance, and inductance. Evidently, the larger the 
number of segments in Figure 1.23b, the better is the 
approximation of the lumped-parameter representa-
tion to the distributed-parameter representation, but 
the more complicated is the analysis. As a first approxi-
mation, the resistive rod can be represented by a single 
resistance and inductance, with capacitance at each end 
(Figure 1.23c). Moreover, if the electric and magnetic 
stored energies are small compared to the energy dis-
sipation, the resistive rod can be represented by a single, 
ideal resistor.
Another aspect of the circuit approximation that is 
implicit in Figure 1.22a is that the electromagnetic field 
takes a finite time to propagate from one end of the 
rod to the other. That is, if the battery is suddenly con-
nected to one end of the rod in Figure 1.22a, it takes a 
finite time before the effects of the electric and magnetic 
fields are felt at the other end of the rod (see Problem 
P1.2). The propagation delay due to the wave nature of 
the electromagnetic field is neglected in basic circuit 
analysis, which is tantamount to assuming that when 
an excitation is applied at one end of a circuit, its influ-
ence is immediately felt at the other end. This is justified 
as long as the propagation delay is small compared to 
the period of the voltage or current signal, where the 
period is the reciprocal of the signal frequency. This is 
tantamount to assuming that the physical dimensions 
of the circuit under consideration are small compared to 
the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, where the 
wavelength is the ratio of the speed of propagation of 
the electromagnetic wave to the signal frequency. If the 
frequency is, say, 1 GHz (109 Hz), which is of the order 
of frequencies used in many communication systems, 
and assuming that the speed of propagation is nearly 
half that of the speed of light in vacuum (3 × 108 m/s), 
depending on the electric and magnetic properties of the 
medium, the wavelength is 15 cm. If the longest dimen-
sion of the circuit exceeds, say, one-tenth of this, or 
1.5 cm, then the lumped-circuit representation can intro-
duce a significant error. On the other hand, the wave-
length at a frequency of 50 Hz is 6000 km, assuming the 
electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light 
along overhead power lines in air. The lumped-circuit 
representation would generally be acceptable in this 
case for overhead power lines of a few hundred kilome-
ters in length.

electric charges, irrespective of the sign of the 
charges that actually carry the current.
•	 Current always has a direction, indicated by an 
arrow that points in the assigned positive direc-
tion of current. That is, positive charges flowing 
in the assigned positive direction represent a 
current having a positive numerical value.
•	 A negative value of current arises either from pos-
itive charges moving in the direction opposite to 
that of the assigned positive direction of current or 
from negative charges moving in the same direc-
tion as the assigned positive direction of current.
•	 The voltage between two points is the change in 
electric potential energy of a charged particle as 
it moves from one of these points to the other, 
divided by the charge of the particle. The volt-
age is independent of the sign of the charge.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
•	 In general, voltage is defined as v = dw/dq and 
is a voltage difference between two points. 
A voltage that is constant with respect to time 
is a dc voltage.
•	 Voltage always has a polarity, or direction, indi-
cated by a plus sign next to the point that is 
assigned a higher, or more positive, voltage rela-
tive to the point that is assigned a lower, or less 
positive or more negative, voltage, indicated by 
a negative sign next to this point.
•	 Current carriers can possess two types of energy: 
potential energy that depends on the voltage 
and kinetic energy that depends on the current.
•	 Power p is defined as the rate at which 
energy is generated or expended. In general, 
p = dw/dt = vi.
•	 Conservation of energy implies conservation of 
power in the circuit as a whole, which means 
that the total power delivered in the circuit is 
equal to the total power absorbed in the circuit 
at every instant of time.
•	 According to the passive sign convention, if 
power is absorbed in a given circuit element, 
current flows through that element in the direc-
tion of a voltage drop across the terminals of the 
given element, whereas if power is delivered by 
a given circuit element, current flows through 
that element in the direction of a voltage rise 
across the terminals of the given element.
•	 Negative values of current, voltage, and power 
are quite natural in circuit analysis and indicate 
that the direction of current, polarity of voltage, 
and direction of power flow are, respectively, 
opposite to that assumed to be positive.
•	 Active circuit elements are capable of supplying 
energy to an electric circuit through conversion 
of energy, ultimately from some nonelectrical 
source of energy. Passive circuit elements are 
incapable of doing so.
•	 In electric circuits, active circuit elements are 
represented by ideal sources, whereas energy-
consuming devices may be represented by ideal 
resistors. Ideal resistors, capacitors, and induc-
tors are passive circuit elements.
•	 The properties of resistance, inductance, and 
capacitance are referred to as circuit parameters.
•	 Idealized models employ ideal circuit elements 
to reproduce, as a first step, the essential behav-
ior of the system under consideration, with-
out extraneous details. They can be refined to 
reproduce more accurately the behavior of the 
system under some specified conditions.
•	 The properties of resistance, capacitance, and 
inductance represent, respectively, the three 
basic attributes of the electromagnetic field, 
namely, energy dissipation, energy stored in 
the electric field, and energy stored in the mag-
netic field. Each of these ideal, passive circuit 
elements represents exclusively one of the fun-
damental attributes of the electromagnetic field.
•	 Ideal circuit elements are basic in the sense 
that none of these elements can be represented 
in terms of the other ideal circuit elements. 
Moreover, the values of resistance, capacitance, 
and inductance are independent of voltage or 
current and are constant with respect to time. 
Hence, circuits in which all resistances, capaci-
tances, and inductances have constant values 
are referred to as LTI circuits.
•	 Basic circuits involve two main approxima-
tions: (1) the distributed nature of resistance, 
capacitance, and inductance is ignored, and (2) 
propagation delay of the electromagnetic field 
is ignored, which is justifiable as long as the 
dimensions of the circuit are small compared 
to the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Always check the units on both sides of an equa-
tion, and always specify the units of the results 
of calculations.
	
2.	Always mark on the circuit diagram the direc-
tions of currents and the polarities of voltages.

A lamp assembly is connected to a battery and a switch 
by a wire 2 m long and 1 mm2 cross section. If a current of 
1 A flows in the wire, determine the time it takes a conduc-

the switch to the lamp assembly, assuming the concentra-
tion of conduction electrons in the wire is 8.4 × 1028/m3 
and the charge on an electron is −1.6 × 10−19 C (refer to

on the time it takes a conduction electron to travel from 
the switch to the lamp assembly, since these electrons are 
present all along the wire at any given time. The delay 
depends on how fast the electric field propagates, after

VAB V between the two metal plates is maintained con-
stant by the battery. Let there be a mechanism for mov-
ing positive charge from the lower plate to the upper

tially constant at 1.50 V for the first 20 h. During the next

rent drops linearly to 80 mA (Figure P1.19). At this point, 
the battery is no longer considered useful. (a) What was

Objective and Overview
This chapter introduces (1) the two ideal circuit ele-
ments of dc circuits, namely, resistors and sources; (2) 
the two basic circuit laws, namely, Kirchhoff’s current 
law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL); and (3) 
the two basic connections between circuit elements, 
namely, series and parallel connections.
The nature of electrical resistance is first explained 
using a simplified model, following which, the very 
basic Ohm’s law defining an ideal resistor is presented. 
Ideal, independent and dependent, voltage and cur-
rent sources are then discussed, with emphasis on their 
defining and essential properties.
Kirchhoff’s laws are introduced as laws derived from 
conservation of charge and conservation of energy, but 
which provide a much simpler means of analyzing cir-
cuit behavior. Series and parallel connections of circuit 
elements are then discussed and linked to Kirchhoff’s 
laws. 
PSpice simulations are introduced in this chapter 
and are included in all numerical examples, whenever 
appropriate, to illustrate and verify the results of analyt-
ical solutions. This chapter concludes with a very help-
ful problem-solving approach and illustrating it with 
examples.
★2.1  Nature of Resistance
Concept: Resistance is fundamentally due to impediments 
to the movement of current carriers in a conductor under the 
influence of an applied electric field.
A sample of a metallic conductor typically consists of a 
large number of crystals in which the rest positions of the 
metal atoms at 0 K are arranged in a regular manner that 
is characteristic of the type of crystal. At ­temperatures 
above 0  K, (1) the crystal atoms vibrate, in randomly 
oriented directions, about their rest positions, with an 
amplitude of vibration that increases with temperature, 
and (2) some electrons, referred to as conduction elec-
trons have sufficient energy to detach from their par-
ent atoms and move freely in the crystal, in randomly 
oriented directions, at thermal velocities of the order of 
107 cm/s at room temperature. Because of this random-
ness, there is no net current in any particular direction 
over a long enough interval of time, in the absence of an 
applied voltage.
When a voltage is applied to a conductor, an electric 
field is established in the conductor, which exerts a force 
on the conduction electrons. Quantum mechanics pro-
vides a rigorous basis for describing the movement of 
electrons in a crystal in terms of the wave nature of elec-
trons and the scattering of these waves by the vibrating 
crystal atoms.
For our purposes, we will use a simpler, much less rig-
orous description based on considering conduction elec-
trons as particles that are accelerated by the electric field 
due to the applied voltage. In moving under the influ-
ence of the electric field, conduction electrons “collide” 
with the vibrating crystal atoms. This is illustrated dia-
grammatically in Figure 2.1 for an electric field ξ applied 
in the negative x-direction at zero time. A conduction 
electron experiences a force −qξ, where q is the magnitude 
of the electronic charge, and the negative sign accounts 
for the negative charge of electrons. Being in the nega-
tive x-direction, ξ has a negative value, which means that 
the force −qξ on an electron is in the positive x-direction. 
The conduction electron will therefore move in the posi-
tive x-direction with an acceleration −qξ/m*, where m* 
is an effective electron mass that takes into account the 
forces exerted by the crystal on the conduction electron. 
In the absence of collisions, the velocity of the conduc-
tion electron increases linearly with time, theoretically 
without limit, as indicated by the dashed line through 
the origin. The current due to the total movement of 
conduction electrons will be in the negative x-direction, 
in terms of the conventional, assumed flow of positive 
charges, and will also theoretically increase without 
limit. No resistance to movement will be experienced by 
conduction electrons under these conditions. However,

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
as a conduction electron moves in the crystal, it collides 
with a crystal atom. Consequently, the conduction elec-
tron loses kinetic energy and hence velocity. After the 
collision, the conduction electron picks up velocity due 
to acceleration by the electric field until it collides again 
with a crystal atom, and so on (Figure 2.1). The collisions 
occur at random intervals and their net effect is that 
they prevent the velocities of conduction electrons from 
increasing without limit. Instead, there will be an average 
velocity of conduction electrons in the direction opposite 
to that of the electric field, referred to as a drift velocity. 
This drift velocity results in a corresponding drift cur-
rent in the direction of the electric field, that is, in the 
negative x-direction in Figure 2.1. For currents normally 
encountered in practice, the drift velocity is quite small, 
less than a fraction of a centimeter per second, super-
posed on the much larger, random thermal velocity.
It is seen that this “collision model” provides a simple 
explanation for electrical resistance in a conductor as 
being due to the limiting of the increase in the velocities 
of conduction electrons, and hence the current, because 
of collisions between vibrating crystal atoms and con-
duction electrons moving under the influence of an 
applied voltage.
In addition, the collision model can explain two 
phenomena associated with current flow in a conduc-
tor: (1) the increase of resistance with temperature and 
(2) the heating effect of current. A rise in temperature 
increases the amplitude of vibration of crystal atoms, 
which increases the probability of collisions. The aver-
age interval between successive collisions is reduced, 
and the increase in velocity between collisions is thereby 
reduced, which decreases the average increase in the 
velocities of conduction electrons. This is reflected as a 
reduction in current, for a given applied voltage, and 
hence an increase in resistance. Moreover, when con-
duction electrons collide with crystal atoms, they lose 
kinetic energy while crystal atoms gain kinetic energy. 
The amplitude of vibration of crystal atoms therefore 
increases, which is reflected as a rise in temperature of 
the conductor. The heating of the material that is associ-
ated with current flow is referred to as Joule heating.
2.2  Ideal Resistor
Definition: An ideal resistor is a purely dissipative circuit 
element that obeys Ohm’s law.
As mentioned in Section 1.8, an ideal resistor only 
dissipates energy. It does not store electric or magnetic 
energy. According to Ohm’s law, the voltage drop across 
an ideal resistor is directly proportional to the current 
through the resistor. Thus,
	
v
Ri
=
	
(2.1)
where R is the resistance of the given resistor. When v is 
in volts and i is in amperes, R is in ohms and is denoted 
by Ω, the Greek capital omega. For an ideal resistor, R is 
a constant, independent of voltage, current, time, and 
temperature.
According to Equation 2.1, the plot of v against i is 
a straight line of slope R passing through the origin, 
irrespective of the magnitude or direction of current 
(Figure  2.2a). The graphical symbol for a resistor is 
illustrated in Figure 2.2b together with the direc-
tion of i that is associated with the polarity of v in 
Equation  2.1. It is important to note that the current 
through an ideal resistor is always in the direction of the 
voltage drop across the resistor, so as to give a posi-
tive value of R in Equation 2.1. Thus, with v and i in 
Equation 2.1 assigned the positive directions indicated 
in Figure 2.2b, a positive value of i is in the direction of 
a positive value of voltage drop v, which gives a posi-
tive value of R in Equation 2.1. This is also in accor-
dance with the passive sign convention (Section 1.7); 
when the assumed positive charges flow down a volt-
age drop, they lose electric potential energy, which is 
converted to heat dissipation in the resistor.
Equation 2.1 may be written as
	
i
R v
Gv
=
=
1
	
(2.2)
where G = 1/R is the reciprocal of resistance, or con-
ductance. The reciprocal of one ohm is one siemens, 
denoted by the symbol S.
The power dissipated in a resistor can be derived from 
Equation 1.10, by substituting for v from Equation 2.1, 
or for i from Equation 2.2, in the expression p  =  vi. 
This gives

When v is in volts, i is in amperes, R is in ohms, and G 
is in siemens, p is in watts.
R for a metal increases somewhat with temperature, 
the temperature coefficient of resistance for metal-
lic conductors being approximately 0.004/°C, which 
means that the resistance increases by about 0.4% per °C 
rise in temperature.
It should be noted that whereas an increase in resis-
tance with temperature is true of all conductors, the 
number of current carriers in metals does not increase 
significantly with temperature. On the other hand, the 
number of current carriers in semiconductors, such 
as silicon, increases very rapidly with temperature. 
As a result, the current, at a given voltage, markedly 
increases with temperature in semiconductors, which 
is reflected as an apparent decrease in resistance with 
temperature.
Example 2.1:  Cold and Hot Resistance 
of Heating Element
Consider a 120 W, 12 V, heating element. It is required 
to determine (a) the resistance and conductance of 
the element at the rated voltage of 12 V, (b) the cur-
rent under these conditions, and (c) the resistance 
of the element at room temperature (20°C), assum-
ing that the  working temperature of the element is 
1200°C and  its ­temperature coefficient of resistance 
is 0.0045/°C.
Solution:
	 (a)	 Applying Equation 2.3, 120 = (12)2/R, which gives 
R = 1.2 Ω and G = 1/1.2 = 0.83 S.
	 (b)	 I = 120 W/12 V = 10 A. As a check, RI2 = 1.2 × (10)2 = 
120 W.
	 (c)	 The variation of resistance with temperature can 
be expressed as R2 = R1[1 + αm (T2 – T1)], where 
αm is the temperature coefficient of resistance and 
R1 and R2 are the resistances at temperatures T1 
and T2, respectively, with T2 > T1. Substituting R2 = 
1.2 Ω, T1 = 20°C, T2 = 1200°C, and αm 0.0045/°C 
gives R1

Ans. (a) 70 J; (b) 14 W.
2.3  Short Circuit and Open Circuit
Definition: A short circuit is a connection of zero resis-
tance, or infinite conductance. An open circuit has infinite 
­resistance, or zero conductance.
When R = 0, Ohm’s law gives v = Ri = 0 for all finite i. 
In other words, the voltage across a short circuit is zero 
for all valid, that is finite, values of current through the 
short circuit. Hence, a plot of v against i for a short cir-
cuit is a horizontal line that coincides with the i-axis 
(Figure  2.4a). In fact, all wiring connections between 
circuit elements in a circuit diagram are implicitly

assumed to be short circuits. When a short circuit is to 
be explicitly indicated, it will be represented as a wiring 
connection between two terminals (Figure 2.4b). When 
R = 0, G = 1/R → ∞.
When G = 0, Ohm’s law gives i = Gv = 0 for all finite v. 
In other words, the current through an open circuit is 
zero for all valid, that is finite, values of voltage across 
the open circuit. Hence, a plot of i against v for an open 
circuit is a horizontal line that coincides with the v-axis 
(Figure 2.5a). When an open circuit is to be explicitly 
indicated, it will be represented as an absence of any 
connection between two terminals (Figure 2.5b). When 
G = 0, R = 1/G → ∞.
Short circuits and open circuits are useful idealiza-
tions representing limiting values of resistance (R → 0 
and R → ∞) that can only be approximated in practice.

nals ‘ab’ in Figure 2.6.
Ans. RL → ∞, that is, terminals ‘ab’ open circuited.
2.4  Ideal, Independent Voltage Source
Definition: An ideal, independent voltage source maintains 
a specified voltage vSRC between its terminals, irrespective of 
the current through the source, where vSRC is independent of 
any voltage or current in the circuit.
A battery denoted by the symbol used in Figures 1.2 
and 1.15 is an example of a dc, ideal, independent volt-
age source. The “ideal” attribute in the definition refers 
to vSRC being maintained irrespective of the current 
through the source, and the “independent” attribute 
refers to vSRC being independent of any voltage or cur-
rent in the circuit.
The fact that an ideal voltage source maintains a speci-
fied voltage vSRC across its terminals irrespective of the 
current through the source means that the plot of v as a 
function of i for the source is a horizontal line displaced 
by vSRC from the i-axis (Figure 2.7a). Ideal, independent 
voltage sources are conventionally represented by a cir-
cle symbol, as in Figure 2.7b, including dc, ideal, inde-
pendent sources. But we will retain the battery symbol 
for the latter, as in PSpice, for clarity when using dc volt-
age sources. As in the case of the battery, the plus and 
minus signs indicate the assigned positive direction of 
source voltage in Figure 2.7b.
Two important considerations should be emphasized 
in connection with ideal, independent voltage sources. 
The first is that, according to Figure 2.7a, either vSRC or i 
can be positive, negative, or zero. In Figure 2.8a, the 
12 V battery is connected to a variable resistor Rvar, that 
is, a resistor whose resistance can be varied, as symbol-
ized by the arrow. As Rvar is varied, the current I through 
the battery varies in accordance with Ohm’s law, but 
the ideal battery maintains a voltage of VSRC  =  12  V 
between its terminals for all values of I, such as I = 2 A,

Fundamentals of Resistive Circuits

as indicated in Figure 2.8a. The power delivered by the 
battery is VSRC × I = 12 × 2 = 24 W. With v and i both 
positive, power is delivered by the battery, as indicated 
in the first quadrant in Figure 2.7c. VSRC is maintained 
at 12 V when I = 0, that is, when the resistor is discon-
nected from the battery. In Figure 2.8b, the polarity of 
the battery is reversed, without reversing the assigned 
positive directions of VSRC and I. The numerical val-
ues of VSRC and I are both negative, in accordance with 
Ohm’s law, so that ­current actually flows into the bat-
tery at the negative terminal. On the v–i graph, both 
v and i assume negative values, but as Rvar is varied, 
the battery voltage is maintained at 12 V magnitude. 
Moreover, with both v and i reversed, the product vi 
does not change sign; the battery still delivers power, 
as indicated in the third quadrant in Figure 2.7c.
In Figure 2.8c, the battery, assumed to be rechargeable, 
is connected to a charging circuit. The current through 
the battery is now reversed, so I assumes a negative 
value, considered in Figure 2.8c to be −2 A, but VSRC is 
still maintained at 12 V.
It should be clarified that in Figure 2.8a through c, 
the assigned positive directions of I and VSRC are the 
same, with I being in the direction of a voltage rise 
through the battery. This means that, in terms of the 
symbols VSRC and I, the product P = VSRCI is the power 
delivered by the battery in the three cases, in accor-
dance with the passive sign convention (Section 1.7). 
When numerical values are substituted, VSRC  =  12  V 
and I = 2 A in Figure 2.8a. The product is +24 W, so 
that this power is actually delivered by the battery. 
In Figure 2.8b, VSRC = −12 V and I = −2 A. The product 
is again +24 W, which signifies that the battery actu-
ally delivers this power. In Figure 2.8c, VSRC = 12 V and 
I = −2 A. P is now equal to −24 W, which means that the 
battery actually absorbs 24 W.
It should be noted, in accordance with Figure 2.8, that 
whereas the voltage of an ideal, independent voltage 
source is that specified for the source and is indepen-
dent of the rest of the circuit, the magnitude and sign of 
the source current depend on both the source voltage and the 
circuit to which the source is connected.
The second important consideration is that ideal, 
independent voltage sources are in general time vary-
ing. This is illustrated for a sinusoidally varying volt-
age in Figure 2.9a and for a pulse voltage in Figure 2.9b. 
Note that although the variation of vSRC vs. t can be 
quite arbitrary, depending on the type of source under 
consideration, the variation of v vs. i for all ideal volt-
age sources is a horizontal line, as in Figure 2.7a. For 
example, if vSRC = 10sint V (Figure 2.9a), where t is in 
seconds, then the vSRC line in Figure 2.7a will move up 
or down in accordance with the value of vSRC at any par-
ticular instant of time. This is illustrated in Figure 2.10,

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
where some values of 10sint are shown for correspond-
ing values of t. Thus, at t = 0, vSRC = 0, and the vSRC line 
coincides with the horizontal axis. As t increases dur-
ing the positive half-cycle, the vSRC line moves upward, 
is at 4.8 V at t = 0.5, and at the peak value of 10 V at 
t = π/2 ≅ 1.6 s. It then moves downward, is at −5.3 V at 
t = 3.7 s, and at −10 V at t = 3π/2 ≅ 4.7 s, and so on. At 
any instant of time, vSRC is independent of the source cur-
rent. When the value of vSRC is positive, then according 
to the assigned positive direction of vSRC in Figure 2.7b, 
the terminal of the voltage source adjacent to the plus 
sign is at a positive voltage with respect to the terminal 
adjacent to the minus sign; the converse is true when 
the value of vSRC is negative.
It is important to note that if in Figure 2.7a, vSRC = 0, 
then the vSRC line coincides with the horizontal axis, so 
that Figure 2.7a becomes identical to Figure 2.4a for a 
short circuit. It follows that when vSRC = 0, an ideal voltage 
source is equivalent to a short circuit. In other words, an 
ideal voltage source is set to zero by replacing it with a 
short circuit.
An ideal, independent voltage source is said to pro-
vide an electromotive force (emf) that provides a kind 
of “driving force” for the current by doing work on the 
assumed positive charges as they flow in the direction of 
a voltage rise through the source. The emf is equal to the 
source voltage. Thus, a 6 volt battery is said to provide 
an emf of 6 V.
Primal Exercise 2.6
Given an ideal, independent voltage source of 12  V 
having a source current of 2 A, determine the power 
and whether it is delivered or absorbed by the source

the source.
Ans. (a) 24 W delivered; (b) 24 W absorbed.

absorbed by the charging circuit.
Ans. (a) and (b) 120 W; (c) and (d) –120 W.
2.5  Ideal, Independent Current Source
Definition: An ideal, independent current source maintains 
a specified current iSRC through the source irrespective of the 
voltage across the source, where iSRC is independent of any 
voltage or current in the circuit.
The “ideal” attribute refers to iSRC being maintained 
irrespective of the voltage across the source, and the 
“independent” attribute refers to iSRC being independent 
of any voltage or current in the circuit.
Although not as common as voltage sources, indepen-
dent current sources can be derived from independent 
voltage sources using electronic circuits such as opera-
tional amplifiers (Chapter 13). A current source can be 
approximated by a voltage source in series with a large 
resistance (Section 3.6).
The fact that an ideal current source maintains the 
specified current iSRC through the source irrespective of 
the voltage v across the source means that the plot of i 
as a function of v for the source is a horizontal line dis-
placed by iSRC from the v-axis (Figure 2.11a). The conven-
tional symbol for an ideal, independent current source is 
a circle with an arrow that points in the assigned posi-
tive direction of source current iSRC (Figure 2.11b); that 
is, if the value of iSRC is a positive quantity, iSRC is in the 
direction of the arrow. The symbol of Figure 2.11c will 
be used in this book for a dc, ideal, independent current 
source, for clarity when using such sources. The polarity 
of the battery in the source symbol is that of a voltage

rise in the direction of the arrow, which is appropriate 
for power delivery.
The following features of an ideal, independent cur-
rent source are exactly analogous to those of an ideal, 
independent voltage source:
	
1.	iSRC, and the voltage v across the source, can be 
positive, negative, or zero.
	
2.	For a given iSRC, the value and sign of v depend 
on both iSRC and the circuit to which the source 
is connected.
	
3.	An ideal current source can deliver or absorb 
power, depending on the relative directions of 
iSRC and v (Figure 2.11d).
	
4.	iSRC is in general a function of time but is ­constant 
with respect to the voltage across the source. 
That is, at any instant of time, iSRC is independent 
of the voltage across the source, even though iSRC 
may be time varying.
In a manner analogous to the case of a voltage source, 
if Figure 2.11a is compared with Figure 2.5a, it is seen 
that when iSRC = 0, an ideal current source is equivalent to an 
open circuit. In other words, an ideal current source is set 
to zero by replacing it with an open circuit.
Fundamentally, a voltage source excites a circuit by 
raising the electric potential energy, that is, the volt-
age, of current carriers. On the other hand, a current 
source excites a circuit by imparting kinetic energy, that 
is, velocity, to current carriers, since current is the rate 
of flow of electric charges, which depends on velocity. 
Short-circuiting a voltage source results in infinite cur-
rent, since the source voltage appears across the zero 
resistance of the short circuit. The resulting current is, 
from Ohm’s law, VSRC/0 → ∞. Hence, short-circuiting 
an ideal voltage source is invalid. The hydraulic anal-
ogy is moving water in a reservoir at a height h above 
ground level instantly down to ground level, which 
would involve infinite rate of flow, or velocity.
Similarly, open-circuiting a current source results in 
infinite voltage, since the source current flows through 
an open circuit of zero conductance. The resulting 
voltage is, from Ohm’s law, ISRC/0 → ∞. Hence, open-­
circuiting an ideal current source is invalid. The hydrau-
lic analogy is instantly blocking the flow of water that is 
issuing from a pump that forces water to flow at a cer-

an infinite force, corresponding to an infinite voltage.

2.6  Ideal, Dependent Sources
Concept: Dependent sources behave exactly like independent 
sources in all respects except that the value of a dependent 
source is specified as a linear function of a voltage or a current 
in the circuit, other than that of the source itself.
Dependent sources are invariably encountered in the 
equivalent circuits of electronic devices, such as opera-
tional amplifiers (Chapter 13) and transistors.
Ideal, dependent sources are represented by a ­diamond 
symbol.

2.6.1  Ideal, Dependent Voltage Sources
Depending on whether the source value is specified 
in terms of a voltage or a current, a dependent voltage 
source can be (1) a voltage-controlled voltage source 
(VCVS) or (2) a current-controlled voltage source 
(CCVS). Figure 2.13 illustrates a circuit having two 
dependent voltage sources. The value of the VCVS is 
specified as twice the voltage VX across the 6 Ω resistor, 
and the value of the CCVS is specified as three times 
IY, the current through the 1.5 Ω resistor. In both cases, 
the plus and minus signs indicate the assigned positive 
direction of the source voltage, as in the case of indepen-
dent voltage sources.
It should be noted that being ideal sources, the speci-
fied source voltage of an ideal, dependent voltage source is 
independent of the current through the source itself, as in 
Figure  2.7a. That is why in the case of the CCVS in 
Figure 2.13, for example, the source voltage depends 
on the current elsewhere in the circuit, such as IY. It 
should not depend on the current through the source 
itself, because this would violate the definition of an 
ideal voltage source as having the source voltage inde-
pendent of the current through the source. If the source 
voltage of a CCVS depends on the current through 
the source, it can be shown (Section 4.5) that such a 
“source” is not really a source and can be replaced by 
a resistor. Similarly, if VX in Figure 2.13 is the voltage 
across the VCVS of source voltage 2VX, then VX = 2VX, 
which makes VX = 0, so that the source is equivalent to 
a short circuit. On the other hand, if the source value is 
VX, and there is no other VX in the circuit except across 
the source, then the source is in fact an independent 
source of value VX.
Primal Exercise 2.10
Given IY = 2.4 A and VX = 1.8 V in Figure 2.13, determine 
(a) the magnitude and direction of the current through 
the 6 Ω resistor; (b) the magnitude and polarity of the 
voltage across the 1.5 Ω resistor; (c) the power delivered 
or absorbed by the battery and by the VCVS; (d) the 
total power dissipated in the resistors; (e) the power 
delivered or absorbed by the CCVS, considering that 
power is conserved in the circuit as whole; and (f) the 
magnitude and direction of current through the CCVS. 
(g) Is charge conserved at the upper and lower junctions 
of three ­elements in the circuit? Justify your answer.
Ans. (a) 0.3  A in the direction of the voltage drop VX; 
(b) 3.6 V drop in the direction of IY; (c) 2.7 W delivered 
by the battery, 8.64  W absorbed by VCVS; (d) 9.18  W; 
(e) 15.12 W delivered by the CCVS; (f) 2.1 A in the direc-
tion of a voltage rise through the CCVS. (g) Yes; the 
number of coulombs entering the junction per second is 
equal to the number of coulombs leaving the junction per 
second.
2.6.2  Ideal, Dependent Current Sources
Depending on whether the source value is specified 
in terms of a voltage or a current, a dependent cur-
rent source can be (1) a voltage-controlled current 
source (VCCS) or (2) a current-controlled current 
source (CCCS). Figure 2.14 illustrates a circuit having 
two dependent current sources. The value of the VCCS 
is specified as twice VX across the 1 Ω resistor, and the 
value of the CCCS is specified as three times IY, the cur-
rent through the 2 Ω resistor. In both cases, the arrows 
indicate the assigned positive direction of the source, as 
in the case of independent current sources.
It should be noted that being ideal sources, the specified 
source current of an ideal, dependent current source is inde-
pendent of the voltage across the source itself, as in Figure 
2.11a. The specified source current should not depend 
on the voltage across the source itself, as this would vio-
late the definition of an ideal current source as having 
the source current independent of the voltage across the 
source. If the source current of a VCCS depends on the 
voltage across the source, it can be shown (Section 4.5) 
that such a “source” is not really a source and can be 
replaced by a resistor.

Fundamentals of Resistive Circuits

Fundamentally, independent sources excite a circuit by 
delivering energy through conversion from some non-
electrical source of energy, such as solar energy or chemi-
cal energy of batteries, or mechanical energy from prime 
movers. On the other hand, dependent sources do not con-
vert energy from nonelectrical sources. They can deliver 
or absorb energy, just like independent sources, but they 
are incapable of exciting a circuit on their own, without 
the presence of independent sources somewhere in the 
circuit (Section 4.1). They affect the voltages and currents 
in a circuit, thereby altering the power distribution in the 
circuit, by effectively modifying the values of some resis-
tances in the circuit (Section 5.1). But the ultimate source 
of energy is the independent sources in a circuit, which 
convert energy from some nonelectrical source to poten-
tial energy or kinetic energy of current carriers.
Figure 2.15 summarizes the classification of ideal sources.
Primal Exercise 2.11
Given IY = 2.7 A and VX = 3.6 V in Figure 2.14, determine 
(a) the magnitude and direction of the current through 
the 1 Ω resistor, (b) the magnitude and polarity of the 
voltage across the 2 Ω resistor, (c) the power delivered or 
absorbed by each source, and (d) the power dissipated 
in each resistor. (e) Is energy conserved in the circuit as 
whole? Is charge conserved at the upper and lower junc-
tions of the four elements connected to these junctions?
Ans. (a) 3.6 A in the direction of the voltage drop VX; 
(b) 5.4 V drop in the direction of IY; (c) battery delivers 
32.4 W, VCCS delivers 38.88 W, CCCS absorbs 43.74 W; 
(d) 12.96 W in the 1 Ω resistor and 14.58 W in the 2 Ω 
resistor; (e) yes, yes.

Argue as was done in connection with Figure 2.13 that 
IY cannot be the current through the CCCS itself in 
Figure 2.14.
Ans. If IY is the current through the CCCS, then IY = 3IY, so 
that IY = 0, and the CCCS is equivalent to an open circuit.
2.7  Nomenclature and Analysis 
of Resistive Circuits
Before considering the analysis of resistive circuits, 
some nomenclature should be explained.
A node is the electrical junction, or connection point, 
between a number of circuit elements. Because the term 
is quite general, it is sometimes necessary to distin-
guish between two types of nodes: an inessential node 
between just two circuit elements and an essential node 
between three or more circuit elements. In Figure 2.16, 
for example, ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ are nodes, but ‘a’ is an ines-
sential node, whereas ‘b’ and ‘c’ are essential nodes. 
Note that ‘b’ and b′ are one and the same node, the con-
nection bb′ being a short circuit. Similarly, ‘c’, c′, and c′′ 
are one and the same node, the connection c′cc′′ being 
a short circuit. Short-circuit wiring connections are used 
in electric circuit diagrams for clarity.
A path is a set of one or more adjoining circuit ele-
ments that may be traversed in succession without pass-
ing through the same node more than once. A branch is 
a path that connects two nodes, whereas an essential 
branch is the set of adjoining circuit elements traversed 
in going from one essential node to an adjacent essen-
tial node, without passing through another essential 
node. In Figure 2.16, all the individual circuit elements 
are branches. Each of the current source and the 3  Ω 
resistor is an essential branch between essential nodes 
‘b’ and ‘c’. The combination of the battery and the 6 Ω 
resistor is also an essential branch between nodes ‘b’ 
and ‘c’.
A closed path in a circuit is a loop. A loop may enclose 
other loops, but if it doesn’t, it is referred to as a mesh. 
In Figure 2.16, the battery, the 6 Ω resistor, and the 3 Ω 
resistor constitute a mesh, as do the 3 Ω resistor and the 
current source. The path consisting of the battery, the 6 Ω 
resistor, and the current source is a loop that encloses the 
two meshes.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Analysis of resistive circuits means, in general, deter-
mining the voltages and currents in a circuit, given the 
values of the sources and resistances in the circuit or given 
some specified conditions in the circuit. In Figure 2.16, 
the values of the resistances, the voltage source, and the 
current source are specified. It is required to determine 
the values of the remaining currents and voltages in the 
circuit. Once I1 and I2 are known, the voltages readily 
follow from Ohm’s law. Thus, the voltage drop across 
the 6 Ω resistor is 6I1 in the direction of I1, where I1 is also 
the current through the battery. The voltage drop across 
the 3 Ω resistor is 3I2 in the direction of I2 and is also the 
voltage across the current source.
In principle, I1 and I2 can be determined from two 
simultaneous equations in these variables. It can be read-
ily shown (Problem P2.61) that conservation of charge at 
the essential nodes provides one equation, whereas con-
servation of power in the circuit provides another equa-
tion. However, the power equation is quadratic in I1 and 
I2. This is generally the case, because the power dissipated 
in a resistor is proportional to the square of the current 
through the resistor, or the square of the voltage across 
the resistor. Consequently, using power as a primary cir-
cuit variable results in nonlinear equations that are rather 
awkward to work with, particularly in more complicated 
circuits. It is advantageous, therefore, to be able to write 
circuit equations that are linear in current and voltage. 
This is provided by Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws, 
which are discussed in the following section.

of nodes, (b) the number of essential nodes, (c) the num-

other than meshes.
Ans. (a) 7; (b) 4; (c) 9; (d) 6; (e) 3; (f) 4.
2.8  Kirchhoff’s Laws
2.8.1  Kirchhoff’s Current Law
Statement: At any instant of time, the sum of currents 
entering a node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the 
node.
KCL is illustrated at a node ‘n’ in Figure 2.18a, where 
the current values indicated may be obtained through 
analysis, simulation, or measurement at node ‘n’. These 
values are in accordance with KCL, since the sum of 
­currents entering the node is 1 + 4 = 5 A and the sum 
of currents leaving the node is 2 + 3 = 5 A.
KCL is simply an expression of conservation of 
current, at any instant of time and at every node in 
a given circuit. It is a direct consequence of conserva-
tion of charge. The charge entering a node during an 
interval Δt is

ling Δt gives the statement of KCL:

It will be noted that just as conservation of energy 
implies conservation of its time derivative, which is 
power (Section 1.7), so does conservation of charge 
imply conservation of its time derivative, which is 
current.
KCL applies not only to known current values at a 
node, as in Figure 2.18a, but also to unknown currents at 
a node having arbitrarily assigned directions. Suppose, 
for example, that unknown currents are assigned as 
all  entering node ‘n’ (Figure 2.18b). Then, according 
to KCL,

But when the numerical values of the currents are

found, for example, that i1 = 1 A, i2 = −2 A, i3 = −3 A, and 
i3 = 4 A. Substituting in Equation 2.7,

as before.
Because it is an expression of conservation of charge, 
KCL applies to whole circuit elements and to combi-
nations of circuit elements. It is always assumed that 
the current that enters a circuit element is equal to the 
current that leaves it. This applies to sources, resistors, 
inductors, and whole capacitors. It would not apply to 
only one of the plates of a capacitor, because charge can 
accumulate on one plate, while the other plate acquires 
an opposite, induced charge. So there will be a conduc-
tion current, due to motion of current carriers, entering 
one plate but no conduction current leaving this plate. 
But KCL applies to the whole capacitor, including both 
plates, as explained in more detail in Section 7.1.
KCL can also be usefully applied to whole circuits or 
to any combination of circuit elements that are part of 
a circuit, as will be illustrated in future examples. For 
now, consider the two interconnected circuits ‘A’ and ‘B’ 
in Figure 2.19a. If one of the circuits is enclosed by a sur-
face ‘S’, then KCL requires that the total current entering 
‘S’ must be equal to the total current ­leaving ‘S’. If ‘A’ 
has two connections, the current entering ‘A’ through 
one connection must be equal in magnitude but oppo-
site in direction to the current leaving ‘A’ through the 
other connection (Figure 2.19a). If either of these cur-
rents is zero, the current in the other connection must 
be zero. If there is only one connection between the 
two circuits, the current in the connection must be zero 
(Figure 2.19b).
Primal Exercise 2.14
If in Figure 2.18b i1 = 1.5 A, i2 = −2 A, and i3 = 1.25 A, 
determine i4 that satisfies KCL.
Ans. −0.75 A.
2.8.2  Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
Before illustrating KVL, it should be emphasized that 
voltages along a path add algebraically. This is consis-
tent with the definition of voltage as electric potential 
energy per unit charge, and the fact that changes in 
potential energy can be added algebraically. Consider, 
for example, the path from ground to node ‘c’ in 
Figure 2.20. Suppose that a small positive charge +δq 
C is moved along the path, where δq is small enough 
so as not to significantly disturb the circuit. If the 
charge is moved from ground, where the voltage and 
potential energy are assumed to be zero, to node ‘a’ 
through the 6 V source, the electric potential energy of 
δq at ‘a’ is 6δq J. If moved to node ‘b’ through a volt-
age rise of 4 V across the resistor, the potential energy 
of δq increases by 4δq J to become 10δq J. The voltage 
at node ‘b’ is 10δq/δq = 10 V, with respect to ground, 
consistent with the voltage at node ‘b’ being the sum 
of 6 V and 4 V. If moved to node ’c’ through a voltage 
drop of 2 V across the resistor, the potential energy of 
δq decreases by 2δq J to become 8δq J. The voltage at 
node ‘c’ is 8δq/δq = 8 V, with respect to ground, con-
sistent with the voltage at node ‘c’ being the algebraic 
sum (6 + 4 – 2) V of the ­voltages across the individual 
branches along the path.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
KVL can be stated as follows:
Statement: At any instant of time, the sum of voltage rises 
around any loop is equal to the sum of voltage drops around 
the loop.
KVL can be illustrated by a mesh in a circuit, as in 
Figure 2.21. The currents in the resistors are indicated, 
and the resistance values are assumed to give the voltage 
differences shown. Which of these voltage differences 
are voltage rises and which are voltage drops depends 
on the sense in which the mesh is traversed, clockwise or 
anticlockwise, but this does not affect KVL. If the mesh 
is traversed clockwise, starting at node ‘b’, there are two 
voltage rises, 3.5 and 4 V, and four voltage drops, 2.5, 3, 
0.5, and 1.5 V. To satisfy KVL, the sum of the voltage rises 
around the mesh must be equal to the sum of the voltage 
drops. Thus, 3.5 + 4 = 7.5 V = 2.5 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5.
The interpretation of KVL follows from conservation 
of energy. Suppose a small charge +δq is taken around 
the mesh, where δq is small enough so as not to sig-
nificantly affect the currents and voltages in the mesh. 
The work done in taking δq around the mesh is δq mul-
tiplied by the sum of all the voltage rises around the 
mesh, whereas the work done by δq is δq multiplied by 
the sum of all the voltage drops around the mesh. By 
conservation of energy, these must be equal; otherwise, 
energy either just vanishes in the mesh or can be con-
tinuously extracted from the mesh at no energy cost. For 
example, if the sum of all the voltage rises around the 
mesh in Figure 2.21 is 7.5 V, but the sum of all the volt-
age drops around the mesh is, say 9 V, a net amount of 
energy equal to 1.5δq can be extracted from the circuit in 
each traversal of the mesh, which violates conservation 
of energy. It follows that

Voltage drops	
(2.9)
Cancelling δq from both sides of Equation 2.9 gives the 
statement of KVL.
It must not be assumed that KVL alone is an expres-
sion of conservation of energy, because the currents that 
produce the voltage rises and voltage drops across the 
circuit elements around the mesh must satisfy KCL. 
Hence, KCL and KVL together are an expression of conserva-
tion of energy in a circuit.
Although KVL was illustrated in the preceding dis-
cussion using a mesh, the same argument applies to any 
loop in the circuit.
To minimize the possibility of error in writing KVL 
around a mesh or a loop, the following procedure is help-
ful and will be illustrated with reference to Figure 2.21:
	
1.	Choose a node as the starting point and as the end-
point in traversing the loop, such as node ‘n’ at the 
bottom of the loop.
	
2.	Decide on the sense in which the loop is to be tra-
versed, say clockwise.
	
3.	Traverse the loop in the chosen direction proceeding 
through all the circuit elements in succession.
	
4.	As each circuit element is crossed, record the volt-
age across the circuit element, assigning it a positive 
sign if it is a voltage rise and a negative sign if it is a 
voltage drop.
	
5.	Set the algebraic sum of the recorded voltages equal 
to zero.
Thus, in Figure 2.21, starting at node ‘n’ and going 
clockwise, the first voltage encountered is a 4 V rise, so 
it is recorded as +4. The next voltage encountered is a 
2.5 voltage drop, so it is recorded as −2.5. Proceeding in 
this manner around the loop and setting the algebraic 
sum equal to zero,

It is seen that this is equivalent to writing 4 + 3.5 = 
2.5 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5, as before, and is in accordance with 
the statement of KVL.
KVL can also be applied to an open path in a circuit 
to determine the voltage between the two ends of the 
path. In Figure 2.22, for example, current and resistance

age drop is Vda and is entered with a negative sign in

Example 2.2:  Verification of KCL and KVL
It is required to simulate the circuit of Figure 2.24 and to 
verify KCL and KVL.
Simulation: Appendix C explains the basics of using 
the educational version of PSpice in an introductory 
course on electric circuits. The circuit is entered in the 
Schematic page of PSpice as illustrated in Figure 2.25. 
The battery is entered as VDC from the SOURCE library, 
and the resistors are entered as R from the ANALOG 
library. In the Simulation Settings, ‘Bias Point’ is selected 
under ‘Analysis type’ and then ‘General Settings’ under 
‘Options’. After the simulation is run, pressing the ‘I’ 
button displays the currents, as in Figure 2.26, in which 
the nodes have been labeled for clarity. The I blocks

circuit element and the I block that indicates the current 
through that element. The location of a dotted line at 
one terminal of a circuit element signifies that current 
enters the circuit element at that terminal. Thus, the 
1.5 A current flows through the battery in the direction 
‘de’ and through R1 in the direction ‘ea’. It is seen that 
1.5 A enter node ‘a’ and leave this node through R2 and 
R6, in accordance with KCL. Similarly, KCL is satisfied 
at every other node in the circuit. Pressing the ‘V’ button 
displays the node voltages with respect to a ground volt-
age of zero, as indicated in Figure 2.27. The voltage drop 
across each resistor, which is equal to the difference 
between the node voltages at the ends of the resistor, has 
been added for clarity. The circuit has three meshes, and 
KVL is satisfied around each mesh. Thus, if mesh d–e–
a–b–d is traversed clockwise, the algebraic sum of the 
voltage rises and the voltage drops is 12 − 3 – 3 − 6 = 0. 
The same is true of the other meshes b–a–c–b and d–b–
c–d. KVL is also satisfied around any loop in the circuit, 
such as d–e–a–c–b–d. The algebraic sum of the voltage 
rises and voltage drops around this loop is 12 − 3 − 5 + 
2 − 6 = 0.
Pressing the ‘W’ button displays the power absorbed in 
each circuit element as in Figure 2.28, where ‘W’ is the 
symbol for power in PSpice. A positive value of power 
is power absorbed, which means that power delivered 
by a source is negative, as indicated by the −18 W for 
the battery. It is seen that the total power absorbed by 
the resistors is +18 W, in accordance with conservation 
of power.
Problem-Solving Tips
•	 The solution to any circuit problem can be checked 
by making sure that Ohm’s law is satisfied for 
every resistor, KCL is satisfied at every node, and 
KVL is satisfied around every mesh.
•	 If a circuit has N essential nodes, then after writing 
KCL for (N − 1) essential nodes, KCL at the remain-
ing node should automatically be satisfied if KCL 
was written correctly at the other nodes. This is a 
useful check on KCL.
The second problem-solving tip of the preceding 
example can be illustrated for the circuit of Figure 2.24 
by labeling the branch currents, as in Figure 2.29. There 
are four essential nodes: ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, and ‘d’. KCL for the 
first three nodes gives the following: node ‘a’: I1 = I2 + I3; 
node ‘b’: I3 = I4 + I5; and node ‘c’: I2 + I4 = I6.
When these three equations are added, I2, I3, and I4 
cancel out, leaving I1 = I5 + I6, which is KCL for node ‘d’. 
Thus, N = 4, and N − 1 = 3, so that only three indepen-
dent KCL equations can be written. KCL for the remain-
ing node is not an independent equation but can be used 
as a check on the KCL equations for the other nodes. The 
number of independent KCL and KVL equations that can 
be written for any circuit is derived in Problem P2.62.
Primal Exercise 2.18

of independent KCL equations and (b) the number of

Example 2.3:  Application of Ohm’s Law, KCL, and KVL
It is required to determine VO in Figure 2.30.
Solution:
VO can be obtained by a step-by-step application of 
Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws without introducing any 
additional, unknown circuit variables.
Step 1: Because the output terminals between which 
VO is specified are open-circuited, no current 
flows in or out at these terminals (Figure 2.31).
Step 2: From KCL at node ‘a’, the current flowing 
through the 10 Ω resistor is 2 A.
Step 3: From Ohm’s law, the voltage drop from 
node ‘a’ to node ‘c’ is 2 × 10 = 20 V.
Step 4: From KCL at node ‘c’, the current through 
the 20 Ω resistor is 0. This can also be deduced by 
enclosing the 2 A source and 10 Ω resistor by a 
­surface, as in Figure 2.19a, and noting that since 
no current enters this surface at node ‘a’, then no 
current leaves this surface at node ‘c’.
Step 5: From Ohm’s law, the voltage across the 20 Ω 
resistor is zero.
Step 6: Applying KVL in going through nodes ‘b’, ‘d’, 
‘c’, ‘a’, and back to ‘d’: −8 + 0 + 20 − VO = 0, which 
gives VO = 12 V.
We could continue and apply Ohm’s law to the 2 Ω 
resistor to determine that 4 A flow through this resistor 
in the direction of the voltage drop of 8 V. From KCL at 
node ‘d’ or node ‘b’, the current in the 8 V source is 4 A 
in the direction of a voltage rise through the source.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 2.32. 
After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in the 
Simulation Settings and running the simulation, press-
ing the I and V buttons displays the currents and volt-
ages indicated in Figure 2.32. The zero current in the 
20 Ω resistor is indicated as 266.5E–18 A, which denotes 
266.5×10−18 A.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Always mark on the circuit diagram the directions 
of currents of interest and the polarities of volt-
ages of interest, bearing in mind that the current 
through an ideal resistor is in the direction of the 
voltage drop across the resistor.
2.9  Series and Parallel Connections
2.9.1  Series Connection
The four elements ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’ in Figure 2.33a are 
connected in series. Geometrically, the most salient feature 
of the series connection is that the elements are connected in 
succession, end to end, without branching at any of the nodes 
between the elements, as diagrammatically illustrated by the 
long, thick arrow in Figure 2.33a. Electrically, the nodes 
between the elements are inessential nodes ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
an inessential node is the same as the current leaving it. 
It follows that the same current flows through all the series-
connected elements as illustrated in Figure 2.33a.
A simple test for elements in series is to check that 
the elements can be traversed in succession along an 
unbranched path, as is the case with elements ‘A’, 
‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’ in Figure 2.33a. In contrast, elements 
‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’ in Figure 2.33b are no longer in series, 
because the path through these elements divides at node 
‘b’ into two branches as shown. Node ‘b’ is now an essen-
tial node at which the current i divides into i1 and  i2. 
However, elements ‘A’ and ‘B’ in Figure 2.33b are still in 
series, as are elements ‘C’ and ‘D’, as well as ‘E’ and ‘F’.
Note that the series connection has the following 
features:
	
1.	Because the current through series-connected 
elements is the same, KCL is automatically satis-
fied in a series connection.
	
2.	Voltages add algebraically along the path through 
series-connected elements. In Figure 2.34a, for 
example, the two resistors and the 6 V battery are 
connected in series, the current through the ele-
ments being assumed to be 1 A. With the voltage 
of node ‘a’ considered 0, the voltage of node ‘c’ is 
5 + 3 = 8 V, and the voltage of node ‘d’ is 8 − 6 = 2 V. 
KVL can be written as 5 + 3 − 6 − Vda = 0, as in 
Figure 2.22, which gives Vda = 2 V.
	
3.	 If one of the series-connected elements is removed 
from the circuit, the current in the series connec-
tion is zero. This is because when an element is 
removed from the series connection, the ­element 
is replaced by an open circuit, as in Figure 2.34b.
Figure 2.35a shows three lamps connected in series, as 
is often done in decorative lighting. The lamps are equiva-
lent to three resistors in series (Figure 2.35b). If a lamp is 
removed, the remaining lamps are turned off because the 
current is interrupted, that is, reduced to zero. A nonelectri-
cal example of a series connection is a number of railroad 
cars coupled together, end to end, to a locomotive. In this 
case, the analog of the same current in the series connec-
tion is the same velocity at which the whole train moves.
2.9.2  Parallel Connection
The three elements ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ in Figure 2.36a are con-
nected in parallel. Geometrically, the most salient feature 
of the parallel connection is that one end of each element, 
marked with ‘x’ in Figure 2.36a, is connected to a common node, 
‘a’, whereas the other end of each of these elements, marked with 
‘z’ in Figure 2.36a, is connected to another common node, ‘b’. 
This implies that the closed path through any two paralleled ele-
ments traverses these two elements only, and no other elements,

as diagrammatically illustrated by the dashed curves in 
Figure 2.36b, which is Figure 2.36a redrawn in the conven-
tional manner, for clarity. Electrically, nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’ are 
essential nodes, and the same voltage v between these nodes 
appears across each of the parallel-connected elements.
Because students often have some difficulty in identi-
fying circuit elements that are in parallel, we will elabo-
rate a little on the parallel connection. It is seen from 
Figure 2.36 that either one of the following two tests can 
be applied to identify circuit elements in parallel:
	
1.	Mark with ‘x’ the ends of all elements connected 
together at the same node and then mark with 
‘z’ the other end of each of the elements; if the 
z-marked ends are all connected to the same 
node, the marked elements are in parallel.
	
2.	Any two elements are in parallel if the closed path 
through them does not traverse any other element.
For example, suppose we wish to identify which ele-
ments in Figure 2.37a are in parallel. We may begin by 
marking with ‘x’ the ends of elements ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and 
‘D’ connected together at node ‘c’. We then mark with ‘z’ 
the other end of each of these elements and check which 
of these z-marked ends are connected to the same node. 
We note that the z-marked ends of elements ‘A’ and ‘B’ 
are connected to node ‘a’, so these elements are in par-
allel. Similarly, the z-marked ends of elements ‘C’ and 
‘D’ are connected to node ‘b’, so these elements are in 
­parallel. However, elements ‘A’ and ‘B’ are not in paral-
lel with elements ‘C’ and ‘D’, because the z-marked ends 
of ‘A’ and ‘B’ are not connected to the same node as the 
z-marked ends of ‘C’ and ‘D’, due to the presence of ele-
ment ‘E’. In the absence of this element (Figure 2.37b), 
the four elements are in parallel.
As a further check, we note that elements ‘A’ and ‘B’ 
in Figure 2.37a form a mesh that does not include any 
other element, so these elements are in parallel, as are 
elements ‘C’ and ‘D’. However, elements ‘B’ and ‘C’ are 
not in parallel, since the mesh that includes these two 
elements also includes element ‘E’. Similarly, elements 
‘A’ and ‘C’, ‘A’ and ‘D’, and ‘B’ and ‘D’ in Figure 2.37a 
are not in parallel. In Figure 2.37b, any mesh or loop 
formed by any two of the four elements does not include 
any other element, so these four elements are in parallel.
As another example, consider Figure 2.38a. Resistors 
R1 and R2 are evidently in parallel, in accordance with 
the aforementioned tests. The circuit of Figure 2.38a may 
be redrawn as in Figure 2.38b. The circuit is the same, for 
if the vertical thick line in Figure 2.38b is collapsed, the 
circuit reduces to that of Figure 2.38a. R1 and R2 are still 
in parallel. If their ends that are connected at node ‘a’ 
are marked with an ‘x’, and their other ends are marked 
with a ‘z’, the z-marked ends are connected at the same 
node ‘c’, although this connection is a ‘short’ connection 
in Figure 2.38a and is a ‘long’ connection in Figure 2.38b. 
Both connections are indicated by a thick line in the fig-
ures. They are wiring connections of zero resistance, as 
is the wiring connection between R1 and R2 at node ‘a’ in 
Figure 2.38a. Moreover, the mesh formed by R1 and R2 
does not include any other element.
The following should be noted about the parallel 
connection:
	
1.	In Figure 2.39, two resistors and a 1 A source are 
connected in parallel, the voltage across the par-
allel combination being assumed to be 6 V. Ohm’s 
law gives a current of 6/2 = 3 A in the 2 Ω resistor, 
and a current of 6/3 = 2 A in the 3 Ω resistor, both 
in the direction of the voltage drop of 6 V. It is seen 
that KVL is automatically satisfied in the mesh or loop 
formed by any two paralleled elements. Thus, start-
ing at node ‘a’, for example, and moving through 
any of the elements to node ‘b’, involves a voltage 
drop of 6 V. Moving back to node ‘a’ through one

of the other two elements involves an equal volt-
age rise of 6 V. KVL is therefore satisfied.
	
2.	The currents through the paralleled elements add 
algebraically at either node between which the ele-
ments are paralleled. In Figure 2.39, the current 
entering node ‘a’ from the rest of the circuit 
is 4 A and is equal to the algebraic sum of the 
branch currents, 3 + 2 − 1 = 4 A, in accordance 
with KCL, as is the 4 A current leaving node ‘b’ 
to the rest of the circuit.
	
3.	In order to have zero current between the end 
nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’ in Figure 2.39, all the paralleled 
elements must be removed from the circuit.
The heating elements of a multielement electric heater 
are typically connected in parallel across the mains volt-
age supply. Figure 2.40 diagrammatically illustrates 
three resistive heating elements connected to the voltage 
supply through switches that allow energizing a single 
element, or two elements, or three elements, at a time.
The series and parallel connections allow building 
circuits of any desired complexity. In Figure 2.41, for 
example, R1 and R2 are connected in series, as are R3 and 
vSRC2; iSRC is connected in parallel with these series com-
binations. The resulting series–parallel combination is 
in turn connected in series with R4 and vSRC1.

2.10  Problem-Solving Approach
The essence of engineering is to produce effective solu-
tions to practical problems through appropriate design 
of equipment, structures, or systems. The most effec-
tive engineering solution to a given problem is the one 
that is reached in minimum time, at minimum cost and 
effort, and which achieves the desired objectives in the 
simplest possible manner. Simplicity is crucial in engi-
neering design, because the simplest solution is almost 
invariably the most reliable, durable, and economical. 
Imagination and creativity can make a decisive differ-
ence in effective problem solving.
It is important therefore to foster the mindset and 
approach that is conducive to effective problem solving. 
Problems on electric circuits provide an opportunity 
toward this goal that should be exploited. This theme is 
emphasized throughout the book.
The steps listed here are intended as a guide to an 
effective problem-solving approach based at this stage 
on Ohm’s law, KCL, and KVL. Depending on the par-
ticular problem under consideration, not all of the steps 
may be applicable in every case. Some of these steps will 
be updated in future chapters in the light of circuit anal-
ysis concepts and methodologies introduced in each of 
these chapters. By the end of Chapter 6, all the main cir-
cuit analysis methodologies would have been presented.
Step 1—Initialize: Generally, this involves the following:
	 (a)	 Mark on the circuit diagram all the given values 
of circuit parameters, currents, and voltages, as 
well as the unknowns to be determined, keeping 
in mind that every current must have a direction 
and every voltage must have a polarity.
	 (b)	 Label the nodes, such as ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, etc., as this is 
usually helpful.
	 (c)	 If the solution requires that a given value of 
­current or voltage be satisfied, assume this value 
from the very beginning, as this can considerably 
facilitate the solution.
Step 2—Simplify: Try and reduce the circuit to a sim-
pler form, if possible. This may be done, for example, by 
redrawing the circuit or by replacing series and parallel 
combinations of circuit elements by an equivalent cir-
cuit element, as discussed in Chapter 3.
Step 3—Deduce: Determine any values of current or 
voltage that follow immediately from direct application of 
Ohm’s law, KCL, or KVL, without introducing any addi-
tional unknowns. The given unknowns, such as required 
outputs, as well as controlling voltages and currents of 
dependent sources, may be used in expressing Ohm’s 
law, KCL, or KVL in this step.
The results of applying Ohm’s law, KCL, and KVL 
should be entered on the circuit diagram itself, includ-
ing directions of currents and polarities of voltages. This 
way, the correctness of these circuit laws can be readily 
checked visually. Bear in mind that the current through 
an ideal resistor that obeys Ohm’s law is always in the 
direction of the voltage drop across the resistor.
KCL, KVL in Step 3 are often sufficient to solve the 
problem, as in Examples 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5. Moreover, it 
may be possible to repeat Steps 2 and 3 alternately in 
some cases. If Step 3 does not provide the solution, pro-
ceed to Step 4.
Step 4—Explore: Consider the nodes and meshes in the 
circuit to see if KCL or KVL can be expressed using a 
single, unknown current or voltage, and if this unknown can 
then be directly determined from KCL or KVL. If so, this step 
provides the solution, because once an unknown cur-
rent or voltage is determined, other required values can 
be derived using KCL, KVL, or Ohm’s law. If Step 4 does 
not provide the solution, proceed to Step 5.
Step 5—Plan: Think carefully about the problem in the 
light of circuit fundamentals and circuit analysis tech-
niques. Imagination, creativity, and experience in prob-
lem solving can play a decisive role in this step. Try to 
think of alternative solutions and select what seems to 
be the simplest and most direct solution.
Step 6—Implement: Carry out your planned solution, 
bearing in mind the following considerations:
	 (a)	 Keep the number of unknown variables to a 
minimum, as this minimizes the likelihood of 
careless mistakes. Make use of any given vari-
ables such as an unknown variable to be deter-
mined or the controlling currents or voltages of 
dependent sources.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
	 (b)	 Mentally ascertain the correctness of equations 
or relations as you write them or copy them, 
in order to minimize the likelihood of careless 
mistakes. If in doubt about the correctness of 
an equation or relation, check the units on both 
sides of the equation or relation or the units of 
numerators and denominators of expressions.
	 (c)	 Keep track of units, and label all calculated 
­values with the appropriate units.
Step 7—Check your calculations and results.
	 (a)	 Check that your results make sense, in terms of 
magnitude and sign.
	 (b)	 Check that Ohm’s law is satisfied for every 
resistor, that KCL is satisfied at every node, and 
that KVL is satisfied around every mesh.
	 (c)	 A good way to check your results is to seek an 
alternative solution to the problem and see if it 
gives the same results.
	 (d)	 Whenever feasible, check your results with 
PSpice simulation. This is a valuable habit to 
acquire. For this reason, PSpice simulation is 
strongly emphasized throughout the book.
The preceding steps will henceforth be referred to by the 
acronym ISDEPIC.
Example 2.4:  Illustration of ISDEPIC Approach
The circuit of Figure 2.16 is analyzed in accordance with 
ISDEPIC.
Solution:
	 1.	 Initialize: The circuit is reproduced in Figure 2.46a, 
indicating values of all the circuit elements.
	 2.	 Simplify: The circuit is in a simple enough form.
	 3.	 Deduce: It is seen that 1.5 A enter the upper node 
and leave the lower node, as in Figure 2.46b. No 
more deductions can be made from immediate 
application of Ohm’s law, KCL, or KVL.
	 4.	 Explore: KCL at either node can be expressed by intro-
ducing a single unknown variable at either node, 
which can then be determined from KVL around the 
mesh on the LHS. The variable could be the current 
in the 3 Ω resistor or in the 6 Ω resistor. If an unknown 
current IX is assigned entering the upper node through 
the 6  Ω resistor (Figure 2.46c), then from KCL, the 
current leaving the node through the 3 Ω resistor is 
(IX + 1.5) A. Ohm’s law and KVL around the mesh 
on the left allow writing an equation in IX that can 
be used for determining IX. Thus, moving clockwise 
around the mesh, starting at the negative terminal of 
the battery, KVL gives +9 − 6IX – 3(IX + 1.5) = 0, so that 
IX = 0.5 A. Once IX is known, all the other unknown 
currents and voltages can be determined.
Alternatively, an unknown voltage VX may 
be assigned to the voltage between the nodes 
(Figure 2.46d). From Ohm’s law, the current leav-
ing the node through the 3 Ω resistor is VX/3. From 
KVL, the voltage drop across the 6  Ω resistor in 
going from the upper node to the positive terminal 
of the battery is (VX − 9) V, and the current leaving 
the node through the 6 Ω resistor is (VX − 9)/6 A. 
From KCL, 1.5 = VX/3 + (VX − 9)/6, which gives 
VX = 6 V.

Note how much simpler is the solution compared to 
that based on conservation of power (Problem P2.61).
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 2.47. ‘Bias 
Point’ is selected under ‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation 
Settings. After the simulation is run, pressing the I and 
V buttons displays the currents and voltages indicated 
in Figure 2.47. It is seen that Ohm’s law, KCL, and KVL 
are satisfied.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Circuits having only two essential nodes can gen-
erally be analyzed by applying KCL at either node.
Primal Exercise 2.22

based on the values of currents and voltages, and verify 
by PSpice simulation.
Ans. Power delivered is 4.5  W by voltage source and 
9 W by current source; power dissipated is 12 W in the 
3 Ω resistor and 1.5 W in the 6 Ω resistor.
Example 2.5:  Illustration of ISDEPIC Approach
It is required to determine IX in Figure 2.48a.
Solution:
The circuit has two essential nodes, as in Example 2.4, 
but with the addition of a VCVS controlled by the volt-
age VA. It will be analyzed by applying ISDEPIC.
	 1.	 Initialize: The circuit is already marked with given 
values and the required IX. The nodes are labeled ‘a’ 
and ‘b’.
	 2.	 Simplify: The circuit is in a simple enough form.
	 3.	 Deduce: 2  A and a current VA/4  A leave node ‘a’ 
(Figure 2.48b). The voltage drop across the 10  Ω 
resistor is 10IX. KCL at node ‘a’ is IX  =  2  +  VA/4. 
A second equation involving IX and VA can be 
derived from KVL around the mesh on the RHS.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Starting at node ‘b’ and going clockwise, KVL gives 
+10 + VA + 10IX − 5VA = 0, or 4VA − 10IX = 10. Solving 
these equations for VA and IX gives IX  =  7  A and 
VA = 20 V.
Since the circuit is a two-essential node circuit, it 
can alternatively be analyzed by writing a single KCL 
equation in one unknown. KVL can be used to express 
IX directly in terms of VA. Thus, Vab = (10 + VA) (Figure 
2.48c). The voltage drop from node ‘a’ to the positive ter-
minal of the VCVS is Vab − 5VA = 10 + VA − 5VA = 10 − 4VA, 
and the current leaving node ‘a’ through the 10 Ω resis-
tor is (10 − 4VA)/10 = 1 − 0.4VA. From KCL at node ‘a’, 
2 + 0.25VA + 1 – 0.4VA = 0, which gives VA = 20 V. Hence, 
IX = −(1 – 0.4VA) = 7 A.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 2.49. 
The VCVS is entered from the ANALOG library as part 
number E having four terminals: two for the voltage 
source and two for the controlling voltage. The multi-
plier for this voltage is entered by double clicking on 
the default ‘Gain  =1’ and changing the value from 1 
to 5 in the ‘Display Properties’ window. ‘Bias Point’ 
is selected under ‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation 
Settings. After the simulation is run, pressing the I and 
V buttons displays the currents and voltages indicated 
in Figure 2.49. It is seen that IX = 7 A, and the voltage 
across the VCVS is 100 V.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Controlling currents or voltages of dependent 
sources are often convenient to use as unknown 
variables in analyzing circuits.
Primal Exercise 2.23
Show that power is conserved in the circuit of Figure 2.48 
based on the values of currents and voltages, and verify 
by PSpice simulation.
Ans. Dependent source delivers 700 W, voltage source 
absorbs 50 W, and current source absorbs 60 W. Power 
dissipated is 100 W in the 4 Ω resistor and 490 W in the 
6 Ω resistor.
Example 2.6:  Illustration of ISDEPIC Approach
It is required to determine R in Figure 2.50a so that 5 A 
flow in the short circuit between nodes ‘b’ and ‘d’ in the 
direction indicated.
Solution:
	 1.	 Initialize: To determine R one should not seek to 
derive a relation between R and the current in the 
short circuit, and then set this current to 5  A to 
find R. This would be a waste of time and effort. 
Instead, the required value of current is assumed to 
begin with, and the circuit is analyzed accordingly. 
This is an example of the initialization step  1(c) 
mentioned under the general problem-solving 
approach.

contains a crossover connection, it is not easy to 
visualize circuit behavior. The crossover connec-
tion is encountered in the zigzag path from node 
‘a’ through nodes ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, and back to ‘a’. The 
crossover connection is removed by relocating the 
four nodes so as to have a straight path around the 
loop ‘abcda’ without a zigzag. The four nodes can 
be placed in a clockwise sense, as in Figure 2.50b, 
and the elements between the nodes connected 
accordingly. Note that nodes ‘b’ and ‘d’ are one and 
the same node, which means that the 12 Ω resistor is 
in parallel R and the 8 and 24 Ω resistors are in par-
allel. Moreover, the two parallel combinations are 
in series across the voltage source. Nevertheless, 
‘b’ and ‘d’ have been separated to show the 5  A 
current.
	 3.	 Deduce: No deductions can be made from immedi-
ate application of Ohm’s law, KCL, or KVL.
	 4.	 Explore: KCL at nodes ‘a’ or ‘c’ is not helpful 
because none of the currents at these nodes is 
known. KVL around the meshes is also not helpful 
for the same reason. KCL at node ‘b’ is not help-
ful either because assigning a single current at this 
node does not allow using KVL to determine this 
current, since R is unknown. However, if a current 
I is assigned entering at node ‘d’ from the 12  Ω 
resistor (Figure 2.50c), the current leaving node ‘d’ 
through the 8 Ω resistor is (I + 5) A. I can then be 
determined from Ohm’s law and KVL around the 
mesh on the LHS. Thus, the voltage drop across the 
12 Ω resistor is 12I V, and the voltage drop across 
the 8  Ω resistor is 8(I  +  5) V. Going around the 
mesh on the LHS in the clockwise sense, starting at 
node ‘c’, KVL gives 120 – 12I – 8(I + 5) = 0, so that 
I = 4 A. To determine R, we note that the voltage 
across the 8 and 24 Ω resistors is the same, since 
these resistors are in parallel, as noted earlier. The 
voltage across the 8 Ω resistor is 8(4 + 5) = 72 V. 
The current through the 24 Ω resistor is therefore 
72/24 = 3 A. From KCL at node ‘b’, the current in R 
is (5 + 3) = 8 A. Since R is in parallel with the 12 Ω 
resistor, the voltage across it is 12I = 48 V. Hence, 
R = 48/8 = 6 Ω.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 2.51. 
R is entered as 6 Ω, and the simulation is used to verify 
that a current of 5 A flows from node ‘b’ to node ‘d’. 
To make PSpice display this current, a 1 μΩ resistor is 
inserted in place of the short circuit. The value of this 
resistance is too small to significantly affect the results. 
‘Bias Point’ is selected under ‘Analysis type’ in the 
Simulation Settings. After the simulation is run, press-
ing the I and V buttons displays the currents and volt-
ages indicated in Figure 2.51.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 A circuit with rather awkward-looking connec-
tions can be redrawn, after labeling of nodes, for 
easier visualization of the connections.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 Electrical resistance is fundamentally due to 
impediments to the movement of current carri-
ers in a conductor in the presence of an applied 
electric field. According to the “collision” 
model, resistance arises because of repeated col-
lisions between the vibrating crystal atoms and 
conduction electrons moving under the influ-
ence of the applied electric field. The collision 
model can also account for (1) the increase of 
resistance with temperature and (2) the heating 
effect of electric current.
•	 An ideal resistor is a purely dissipative circuit 
element that obeys Ohm’s law: v = Ri, where R, 
the resistance, is a constant that is independent 
of current, voltage, time, or temperature. When 
v is in volts and i is in amperes, R is in ohms.
•	 Ohm’s law can be expressed as i = Gv, where 
G = 1/R is the conductance. When R is in ohms, 
G is in siemens.
•	 The current through an ideal resistor is always 
in the direction of the voltage drop across the 
resistor, so as to give a positive value of R in the 
expression for Ohm’s law.
•	 The power dissipated in a resistor is p = vi = 
Ri2 = v2/R = Gv2.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
•	 A short circuit is a connection of zero resistance, 
or infinite conductance. An open circuit has infi-
nite resistance, or zero conductance.
•	 An ideal voltage source, whether an indepen-
dent or a dependent, ideal voltage source, 
maintains a specified source voltage between 
its terminals, irrespective of the current through 
the source. The specified source voltage could 
be positive, negative, or zero.
	
1.	 Whereas the source voltage is solely that 
specified for the source, the current through 
the source depends on both the source volt-
age and the rest of the circuit to which the 
voltage source is connected. The source 
current can be positive, negative, or zero.
	
2.	 The source voltage is in general a function 
of time, but does not vary with the current 
through the source.
	
3.	 The ideal voltage source can deliver or absorb 
power, depending on the relative directions 
of source voltage and source current.
	
4.	 When the source voltage is zero, the ideal 
voltage source is equivalent to a short circuit.
•	 In an ideal, independent voltage source, the 
source voltage is specified independently of any 
voltage or current in the circuit.
•	 An ideal, dependent voltage source behaves 
exactly like an ideal, independent voltage 
source, except that the specified source voltage 
depends on a voltage or a current other than that 
of the source itself. There are thus two types of 
dependent voltage sources: a VCVS and a CCVS.
•	 An ideal current source, whether an indepen-
dent or a dependent, ideal current source, main-
tains a specified current through the source, 
irrespective of the voltage across the source. The 
specified source current could be positive, nega-
tive, or zero.
	
1.	 Whereas the source current is solely that 
specified for the source, the source voltage 
depends on the both the source current and 
the rest of the circuit to which the current 
source is connected. The source voltage can 
be positive, negative, or zero.
	
2.	 The source current is in general a function 
of time, but does not vary with the voltage 
across the source.
	
3.	 The ideal current source can deliver or absorb 
power, depending on the relative directions 
of source voltage and source current.
	
4.	 When the source current is zero, the ideal cur-
rent source is equivalent to an open circuit.
•	 In an ideal, independent current source, the 
source voltage is specified independently of any 
voltage or current in the circuit.
•	 An ideal, dependent current source behaves 
exactly like an independent current source, 
except that the specified source current depends 
on a voltage or a current other than that of the 
source itself. There are thus two types of depen-
dent current sources: a VCCS and a CCCS.
•	 A node is the connection point between a num-
ber of circuit elements. An inessential node is a 
node between just two circuit elements, whereas 
an essential node is a node between three or 
more circuit elements.
•	 A path is a set of one or more adjoining circuit 
­elements that may be traversed in succession 
without passing through the same node more 
than once. A branch is a path that connects two 
nodes, whereas an essential branch is the set of 
adjoining circuit elements traversed in going 
from one essential node to an adjacent essential 
node, without passing through another essen-
tial node.
•	 A loop is a closed path in a circuit. A mesh is a 
loop that does not enclose any other loop.
•	 Although electric circuits can be analyzed 
based on conservation of current and conser-
vation of power, this is awkward in practice 
because of the quadratic dependence of power 
on current or voltage. Kirchhoff’s laws (KCL 
and KVL) are much more convenient to apply 
because they are linear in current and voltage.
•	 According to KCL, the sum of currents entering 
a node at any instant of time is equal to the sum 
of currents leaving the node at that instant.
	
1.	 KCL is a direct expression of conservation 
of current.
	
2.	 KCL applies not only to known current 
values at a node but also to unknown cur-
rents at a node having arbitrarily assigned 
directions.
	
3.	 KCL can also be applied to whole circuits or 
to any combination of circuit elements that 
are part of a circuit.
•	 Voltages along a path add algebraically. This 
is consistent with the definition of voltage as 
electric potential energy per unit charge, and 
the fact that changes in potential energy can be 
added algebraically.
•	 According to KVL, the sum of voltage rises around 
any loop at any instant of time is equal to the sum 
of voltage drops around the loop at that instant.

Fundamentals of Resistive Circuits	
47
	
1.	 To minimize the possibility of error in writing 
KVL around a mesh or a loop, a systematic 
procedure can be followed in writing KVL.
	
2.	 KVL can also be applied to an open path in a 
circuit to determine the voltage between the 
two ends of the path.
•	 KVL and KCL together are an expression of 
­conservation of energy.
•	 The following are the features of a series con-
nection of circuit elements:
	
1.	 The elements are connected in succession, 
end to end, without branching at any of the 
nodes between the elements.
	
2.	 The same current flows through all the ele-
ments, so KCL is automatically satisfied.
	
3.	 Voltages add algebraically along the path 
through series-connected elements.
	
4.	 If one of the series-connected elements is 
removed from the circuit, the current in the 
series connection is zero.
•	 The following are the features of a parallel con-
nection of circuit elements:
	
1.	 One end of each element is connected to 
a common node, whereas the other end 
of each of these elements is connected to 
another common node.
	
2.	 Any two paralleled elements form a mesh or 
a loop that does not include any additional 
elements.
	
3.	 The same voltage appears across all the par-
allel-connected elements, so KVL is auto-
matically satisfied.
	
4.	 Currents add algebraically at the nodes 
between which the elements are paralleled.
•	 The series and parallel connections can be 
used to build resistive circuits of any desired 
complexity.
•	 A problem-solving approach, ISDEPIC, can be 
applied as a series of steps that can be very help-
ful in analyzing a given circuit and arriving at 
the solution systematically and efficiently.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	The solution to any circuit problem can be 
checked by making sure that Ohm’s law is satis-
fied for every resistor, KCL is satisfied at every 
node, and KVL is satisfied around every mesh.
	
2.	If a circuit has N essential nodes, then after writ-
ing KCL for (N − 1) essential nodes, KCL at the 
remaining essential node should be automati-
cally satisfied if KCL was written correctly at 
the other nodes.
	
3.	Always mark on the circuit diagram the direc-
tions of currents of interest and the polarities 
of voltages of interest, bearing in mind that the 
current through an ideal resistor is in the direc-
tion of the voltage drop across the resistor.
	
4.	Circuits having only two essential nodes can 
generally be analyzed by applying KCL at either 
node.
	
5.	Controlling currents or voltages of dependent 
sources are often convenient to use as unknown 
variables in analyzing circuits.
	
6.	 A circuit with rather awkward-looking connec-
tions can be redrawn, after labeling of nodes, for 
easier visualization of the connections.

P2.62	 Consider the circuit of Figure P2.62 having four essen-
tial nodes (N = 4), three meshes (M = 3), and six essential 
branches (B = 6). Remove three branches so that the four 
essential nodes remain connected by three branches in 
an open path, without any loops. Clearly, B1 = N − 1, 
where B1 is the number of remaining branches, because 
N will always exceed B1 by 1 under these conditions. 
Now add the remaining (B  −  B1) branches one at a 
time, noting that each added branch forms a new loop. 
Deduce that B = M + N − 1. Try this on any other circuit. 
Note that the result is perfectly general and gives the 
number of independent KCL equations (N − 1) and the 
number of independent KVL equations (M) that can be 
written for the circuit.

Objective and Overview
Circuit equivalence is ubiquitous in circuit ­analysis 
because of its usefulness, although it is often not 
­explicitly referred to as such. The chapter begins by 
defining ­circuit equivalence and examining its ­general 
implications. The simple case of series and paral-
lel connection of resistors is considered to begin with 
and applied to deriving the relation between resistiv-
ity and resistance and to the star–delta transformation. 
The series and parallel connections of ideal sources are 
­contrasted with those of resistors. This leads to a dis-
cussion of linear-­output sources that have a resistor as 
an integral part of the source. Circuit equivalence is 
then applied to deriving the very useful transformation 
between linear-­output, voltage, and current sources.
In addition to highlighting the concept of circuit 
­equivalence, this chapter presents some important 
deductions concerning circuit behavior.
3.1  Circuit Equivalence and Its Implications
Definition: Two circuits are equivalent at a given pair 
of ­terminals if the circuits have the same voltage–current 
­relation at these terminals.
Circuit ‘Neq’ in Figure 3.1 is equivalent to circuit ‘N’ at ter-
minals ‘ab’ if for any arbitrary v applied between terminals 
‘ab’ to the two circuits, the resulting current i at these termi-
nals is the same in both circuits. In other words, the v–i rela-
tion at terminals ‘ab’ is the same for the two circuits. This 
implies that ‘Neq’ can be substituted for ‘N’, terminal for 
terminal, without affecting v and i at the terminals. Herein 
lies the usefulness of circuit equivalence, for ‘Neq’ can be 
simple enough so that, when substituted for ‘N’ in a circuit 
that contains ‘N’, the analysis of the circuit is considerably 
facilitated, as will be demonstrated on many occasions.
Circuit equivalence has the following implications:
	
1.	If v is a given function of time (Figure 3.2), then 
i is in general a different function of time but is 
the same in both circuits. This follows from hav-
ing the same v–i relation, for if i is the same in 
both circuits for a given v, then as v varies with 
time, i will vary with time in the same way in 
both circuits.
	
2.	The same power is delivered or absorbed at the 
terminals of equivalent circuits. This follows 
from the fact that if v and i are the same at the 
given terminals, then their product, the instan-
taneous power, is the same.
	
3.	Just as the product of v and i is the same at the 
given terminals, their ratio must also be the 
same. As will be clarified later, the ratio v/i can 
be interpreted as an input resistance Rin look-
ing into the given terminals if two conditions 
are satisfied: (1) the ratio is independent of time, 
as when v and i are dc quantities, for example, 
and (2) neither N or Neq contain ­independent 
sources or these sources are set to zero.
3.2  Series and Parallel Connection 
of Resistors
3.2.1  Series Connection of Resistors
Figure 3.3a illustrates a series connection of three ­resistors 
to which a test source voltage vT is applied, resulting in 
the flow of a test current iT in the circuit. It is of interest

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
to determine (1) the equivalent series resistance Reqs 
between terminals ‘ab’ and (2) the voltages v1, v2, and v3 
across the individual resistors in terms of vT.
To analyze the circuit, we note that KCL is automati-
cally satisfied by the series connection (Section 2.9). It 
remains to satisfy KVL and Ohm’s law. Starting from 
node ‘b’ and going clockwise, KVL gives

From the definition of circuit equivalence, the 
­equivalent series resistance Reqs is such that if the same 
voltage vT is applied at the terminals of the equivalent 
resistor as at ­terminals ‘ab’ of the series combination, the 
same current iT flows through the resistor (Figure 3.3b).

Although derived for the case of three resistors, 
Equations 3.4 and 3.5 can be readily generalized to 
any  number of resistors in series. In particular, the 
­following applies:
	
1.	If n identical resistors, each of resistance R, are 
connected in series, Reqs = nR.
	
2.	Since the resistances have positive values, it is 
evident from Equation 3.4 that Reqs is larger than 
the largest of the series-connected resistances.
Summary: In a series connection of resistors, (1) the equiva-
lent series resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, 
(2) the equivalent series resistance is larger than the largest 
individual resistance, and (3) the ­reciprocal of the equivalent 
series conductance is the sum of the reciprocals of the indi-
vidual conductances.

In words, the ratio of the voltages across any two

also follows directly from Ohm’s law, in that if the same 
current flows through any two resistors, then the ratio of 
the voltages across each resistor must be the same as the 
ratio of the resistances.

resistors Rj is denoted by vj, the ratio of vj to v is the same as 
the ratio of Rj to the total series resistance.
This is a useful result known as voltage ­division. 
It also follows from circuit equivalence that the same 
power p  =  vi is dissipated in Reqs as in the series 
combination.
Example 3.1:  Series-Connected Resistors
Consider three resistors of 1, 2, and 3 Ω connected in 
series. It is required to (a) determine Reqs, (b) derive the 
conductance of each resistor and Geqs, (c) verify that 
the reciprocal of Geqs is Reqs, (d) determine iT assuming 
vT = 3 V, (e) verify that the power dissipated in Reqs is the 
sum of the powers dissipated in each of the three resis-
tors, and (f) determine v1, v2, and v3 using both forms 
of Ohm’s law (Equations 2.1 and 2.2) and Equations 3.7 
through 3.9. Verify that the voltages are in the ratio of 
the resistances.
Solution:
	 (a)	 Let R1 = 1 Ω, R2 = 2 Ω, and R3 = 3 Ω. It follows from 
Equation 3.4 that Reqs = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 Ω.
	 (b)	 G1 = 1/1 = 1 S, G2 = 1/2 = 0.5 S, and G3 = 1/3 S,

same whether expressed in terms of resistance or 
conductance.
	 (d)	 Applying Ohm’s law to Reqs, 3 = 6iT, so iT = 0.5 A.

and 3 × (0.5)2 = 0.75 W. The total power is 1.5 W, 
which is the same as the power ­dissipated in Reqs.

vidual resistors.
Ans. (a) 10 Ω; (b) G4 = 0.25 S, 0.1 S; (c) 0.6 A; (d) v1 = 0.6 V,

From the definition of circuit equivalence, the equiv-

Although derived for the case of three resistors, 
Equations 3.14 and 3.15 can be readily generalized to 
any number of resistors in parallel. In particular, the 
­following applies:
	
1.	If n identical resistors, each of resistance R, are 
connected in parallel, Reqp = R/n.
	
2.	Since the resistances have positive values, it is 
seen from Equation 3.15 that 1/Reqp is larger than 
the largest reciprocal of the individual resistances, 
which is the reciprocal of the smallest resistance, 
say, R1. If 1/Reqp > 1/R1, then Reqp < R1, that is, Reqp 
is smaller than the smallest paralleled resistance.
Summary: In a parallel connection of resistors, (1) the 
equivalent parallel conductance is the sum of the individual 
conductances, (2) the reciprocal of the equivalent parallel 
resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resis-
tances, and (3) the equivalent parallel resistance is smaller

In words, the ratio of the currents through any two

This also follows directly from Ohm’s law, i = Gv, in that 
if the same voltage appears across any two resistors, 
then the ratio of the currents through each resistor must 
be the same ratio as the conductances.
Summary: In a parallel connection of resistors in which the 
total current is i and the current through any of the individual 
resistors Rj is denoted by ij, the ratio of ij to i is the same as the 
ratio of Gj = 1/Rj to the total parallel conductance.
This is a useful result known as current division. 
It also follows from circuit equivalence that the same 
power p  =  vi is dissipated in Reqp as in the parallel 
combination.

where the parallel lines ‖ denote a parallel ­connection. 
In words, the equivalent resistance of two paralleled 
resistors is the product of the resistances divided by 
their sum. When Reqp of more than two resistors is to be 
calculated manually, it is usually more convenient to 
apply Equation 3.22 to two resistances at a time or to 
use Equation 3.14. On the other hand, for calculations 
using computer programs, it is often more convenient 
to use a generalization of Equation 3.15 (Problem P3.65).

These relations also follow from Equations 3.17 
through 3.19 by setting G3  =  0 and replacing each 
of G1 and G2 by its reciprocal resistance R1 and R2, 
respectively. Note that the ratio of either branch cur-
rent to the total current is the same as the ratio of the 
­resistance in the other branch to the sum of the two 
resistances. Another way of remembering this when 
the ­numerical values of R1 and R2 are given is to bear 
in mind that the smaller current flows in the branch hav-
ing the larger resistance in order to equalize the voltage 
across the two resistors.
Example 3.2:  Parallel-Connected Resistors
Consider three resistors of 2, 3, and 6 Ω connected in 
parallel. It is required to (a) determine Reqp by apply-
ing (i) Equation 3.22 first to the 3 and 6 Ω resistors 
and then to the 2 Ω resistor and (ii) Equation 3.15 in 
the form Reqp = R1R2R3/(R1R2 + R2R3 + R3R1), (b) derive 
the conductance of each resistor and Geqp, (c)  verify 
that the reciprocal of Geqp is Reqp, (d) determine vT 
assuming iT  =  3  A, (e) verify that the power dissi-
pated in Reqp is the sum of the powers dissipated in 
each of the three resistors, and (f) determine i1, i2, 
and i3 using  Ohm’s  law and verify Equations 3.17 
through 3.20.
Solution:
	 (a)	 Let R1 = 2 Ω, R2 = 3 Ω, and R3 = 6 Ω; (i) the paral-
lel resistance of 3 and 6 Ω is, from Equation 3.22,

the voltage division Equations  3.7 through 3.9 
are  applicable only when the same current flows in 
series-connected resistors. With R2 replaced by Reqp, 
the same current I1 flows in R1 and Reqp, so that the 
voltage division relations can be applied. Voltage 
division should not be applied in Figure  3.11b 
between the 2 Ω resistor and either the 3 Ω resistor 
alone or the 6 Ω resistor alone.
	 (b)	 I1 in Figure 3.11b is 10/(2 + 2) = 2.5 A. From current

Simulation: The two circuits are entered as in 
­Figure 3.12. After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under ‘Analysis 
type’ in the Simulation Settings and running the simula-
tion, pressing the I and V buttons displays the currents 
and ­voltages, respectively, as in Figure 3.12.
Problem-Solving Tips
•	 Never apply voltage division except to resistors in 
series, that is, resistors that carry the same current.
•	 In current division the largest current flows in 
the branch having the smallest resistance, and 
conversely.
•	 Never apply current division except to resistors in 
parallel.
Note that just as voltage division should be applied 
only to resistors in series, current division should only be 
applied to resistors in parallel. In Figure 3.13, for example, 
current ­division cannot be applied to I1, I2, and I3, as was 
done in Figure 3.11b, because the 3 and 6 Ω resistors are 
not in parallel.

★3.3  Resistivity
Definition: The resistivity, or specific resistance, of a given 
material is the resistance between two opposite faces of a cube 
of the material multiplied by the length of the side of the cube. 
The reciprocal of resistivity is conductivity.
The resistivity ρ of a given material is an intrinsic 
property of the material that is indicative of its electrical 
resistive property. It is independent of the size or shape 
of the conducting material, just as density is an intrinsic 
property indicative of the “heaviness” or mass prop-
erty of the material irrespective of its size and shape. It 
follows from the definition of ρ that ρ is expressed as 
Ω-unit length, with reference to a cube of the material 
having a side of unit length. In the case of copper at 
room temperature, for example, ρ ≅ 1.7 × 10−6 Ωcm if 
the cube is of 1 cm side, or 1.7 × 10−6 Ωcm × (mm/cm) = 
1.7 × 10−5 Ω mm if the cube is of 1 mm side. Conductivity 
is expressed as siemens/unit length.
A useful relation involving resistivity is the following 
expression for the resistance R between two opposite 
ends of a block of length L units and having a uniform 
cross-sectional area of A square units:
	
R
L
A
L
A
=
=
r
s
	
(3.25)
where σ = 1/ρ is the conductivity. The expression high-
lights the fact that resistance is directly proportional to 
the length of the current path through the conductor 
and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area 
through which the current flows. Increasing the length 
of path means more collisions between conduction elec-
trons and crystal atoms, which increases the resistance. 
A larger cross-sectional area provides more paths for the 
current to follow, which increases the current for a given 
applied voltage and hence decreases the resistance. 
ρ and σ in Equation 3.25 are independent of the length 
of path or cross-sectional area.
To derive Equation 3.25 we note that, according to 
the discussion of Section 2.1, current flows in a medium 
under the influence of the electric field ξ and in the direc-
tion of this field. The total current depends on the extent 
of the medium; hence, a more appropriate measure of 
the effect of ξ on current flow is the current per unit 
area of flow, denoted as the current density J. Consider 
a small cube of the material oriented so that one of its 
sides is parallel to ξ (Figure 3.16a). From the relation 
ξ = −dv/dx, the voltage drop from the rear face of the 
cube to its front face is −dv = ξΔx. The current through 
the cube, in the direction of ξ, is the current density mul-
tiplied by the area of the face, that is, J(Δx)2. If the resis-
tance in ohms between the rear and front faces of the 
cube is denoted by ρ′, Ohm’s law applied to the cube is 
ξΔx = ρ′J(Δx)2, which gives

The resistance ρ′ depends on Δx, which makes it unsuit-
able as an intrinsic measure of resistance. However, both 
ξ and J are “local” quantities that do not depend on the 
size or shape of the medium, which makes the ratio 
ξ/J a suitable measure of the intrinsic resistance of the 
medium. The ratio ξ/J is denoted as the resistivity ρ of

Note that the relation ξ = ρJ, or J = σξ, is referred to as

Consider next a block of a conductor of length L 
units and a uniform cross section of area A square units 
(Figure 3.16b). Let the block be divided into small cubes 
of side Δx oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 
block. The resistance of each cube between opposite faces 
is ρ′ = ρ/Δx. A strip of these cubes that extends along the 
length of the block will have L/Δx of these cubes side by 
side. The resistances of these cubes add in series, which 
makes the resistance between the two ends of the strip 
(L/Δx) × (ρ/Δx) = ρL/(Δx)2. The block will have A/(Δx)2 
strips side by side across the block, with the resistances 
of the strips combining in parallel. The resistance R 
between the two ends of the block will therefore be

Ans. 12.5 kΩ.
3.4  Star–Delta Transformation
An application of series–parallel equivalence is the 
star–delta, or Y–Δ, transformation. Consider three resis-
tors Ra, Rb, and Rc connected in delta (Figure 3.17a) 
and another three resistors R1, R2, and R3 connected 
in Y (Figure 3.17b). It is desired to derive the relations 
between these two sets of resistances so that the two 
circuits are equivalent between any two of the three 
terminals.
According to the definition of circuit equivalence, if 
a test source vT is applied between, say, terminals ‘a’ 
and ‘c’ of the Δ-circuit and this same source is applied 
between terminals ‘a’ and ‘c’ of the Y-circuit, the same 
vT−iT relation is obtained in both circuits, as illustrated 
in Figure 3.18.
According to the third implication of circuit equiva-
lence discussed in Section 3.1, the ratio of v to i is the 
same at the corresponding terminals of equivalent 
circuits. Moreover, since the Δ- and Y-circuits consist 
entirely of resistors, without any independent sources, 
the ratio of vT to iT is evidently some resistance, referred 
to as the input resistance Rin between terminals ‘a’ and 
‘c’, or the resistance seen by the source between these ter-
minals. It follows that the Δ- and Y-circuits in Figure 3.17 
are equivalent if they have the same input resistance 
between terminals ‘ab’, ‘bc’, and ‘ca’. However, an 
additional consideration in this case is the state of the 
third terminal when determining the input resistance 
between a given pair of terminals. Equivalence requires 
that whatever is done with the third terminal, it should 
be the same in the two circuits. A convenient condi-
tion to impose on the third terminal is to simply leave 
it open-circuited in both cases, although this is by no 
means the only possibility (Problem P3.66).
In Figure 3.18b, the resistance Rac between termi-
nals ‘ac’, with terminal ‘b’ open, is that of R1 and R3 in 
series, that is, (R1 + R3). In Figure 3.18a, the resistance 
between terminals ‘ab’, with terminal ‘b’ open, is that of 
Rb in ­parallel with the combination of Ra and Rc in series.

To help apply the preceding relations in a systematic 
way, the two equivalent circuits are superimposed, as 
in Figure 3.19. Each Y-resistance is the product of the 
Δ-resistances on either side of it divided by the sum of 
the three Δ-resistances. Conversely, each Δ-resistance 
is the sum of the products of the Y-resistances, two at 
a time, divided by the Y-resistance that is at a right 
angle to the given Δ-resistance.
When the three resistances in either configuration are 
equal, the preceding relations reduce to

and

(3.38)
An interpretation of these relations is that the Δ-circuit 
is more of a parallel circuit, whereas the Y-circuit is more 
of a series circuit. Since resistances in series give a larger 
equivalent resistance, whereas resistances in parallel 
give a smaller equivalent resistance, then if the two cir-
cuits are to be equivalent, the Δ-circuit should have the 
larger resistances.
Primal Exercise 3.13
Assume that in Figure 3.19 the resistances connected in 
Y are 1 Ω each and the resistances connected in Δ are 3 Ω 
each. Determine the resistance between nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’.
Ans. 1 Ω.

terminal left open.
Ans. (a) RY = 2 Ω; (b) 36 W; from circuit equivalence, the 
product vi is the same.
Example 3.4:  Delta–Star Transformation
It is required to determine Req between terminals ‘bd’ in 
the circuit of Figure 3.20a.
Solution:
Either of the two sets of delta-connected resistors could 
be transformed to its equivalent star circuit. The delta cir-
cuit between terminals ‘acd’ is transformed to its equiva-
lent star circuit using Equations 3.32 through 3.34, where 
the sum of the resistances in delta is 10 + 25 + 15 = 50 Ω.

the equivalent star circuit, terminal for terminal, result-
ing in the circuit of Figure 3.20b. The 5 Ω resistance is 
added to the 9 Ω to give 14 Ω, and the 7.5 Ω resistance 
is added to the 6.5 Ω to give also 14 Ω. The two 14 Ω resis-
tors in parallel give 7 Ω, which is added to the 3 Ω to give 
10 Ω between terminals ‘bd’.
It should be noted that although nodes ‘b’ and ‘d’ 
in Figure 3.20 are not shown connected to anything, it 
must be borne in mind that Req is formally determined, 
by measurement or PSpice simulation, by connecting 
a test source, such as vT, and determining the resulting 
current iT. Req is then the ratio vT/iT. It must not be assumed 
that nodes ‘b’ and ‘d’ are open-circuited when determining 
Req and therefore wrongly conclude that the 9 and 6.5 Ω 
resistors are in series in  Figure 3.20a and that the 10 and 
15 Ω resistors are also in series.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 3.21. 
Note that the required equivalent resistance can be con-
veniently determined by applying a source current of 
1 A between the two terminals in question. The ­voltage 
between these terminals is then numerically equal to the 
required resistance. After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under 
‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation Settings and running 
the simulation, pressing the V button ­displays the volt-
ages shown. Vbd = 10 V, so Req = (10 V)/(1 A) = 10 Ω.

Simulate the circuit of Figure 3.20b as in Example 3.4 
and verify the voltages at terminals ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.

tors are connected in star and transforming them to the

Ans. 10 Ω.
3.5  Series and Parallel Connections

Having derived in Section 3.2 the equivalent series and 
parallel resistances of resistors connected in series or

sources, the other basic circuit element introduced in 
Chapter 2, combine in series or in parallel.

where iX and vY are, respectively, current and voltage some-
where in the circuit. Evidently, these relations can be gen-
eralized to any number of series-connected, independent 
or dependent ideal voltage sources of any source voltage 
and any polarity, in any combination. Moreover, because 
the sources are ideal, the terminal voltage vab is indepen-
dent of the current through the series combination.
A similar generalization cannot be made in the case of 
paralleled ideal voltage sources. The following concept 
applies in this case: 
Concept: Ideal voltage sources should not be paralleled, 
unless they have the same source voltage and the same 
­polarity. Otherwise, conservation of energy is violated.
To justify this, consider two ideal voltage sources 
of unequal source voltages connected in parallel 
(Figure 3.23a). Such a connection evidently violates KVL 
because vSRC1 − vSRC2 ≠ 0. More fundamentally, such a 
connection violates conservation of energy. Thus, if a 
charge q is taken clockwise around the circuit, the work 
done in taking q up a voltage rise vSRC1 is qvSRC1, and the 
work done by the charge in moving down a voltage 
drop vSRC2 is qvSRC2. If qvSRC2 > qvSRC1, for example, then it 
would be possible, at least in principle, to extract energy 
continuously from the circuit, at no energy cost, simply 
by moving q around the circuit, in violation of conserva-
tion of energy. Such a connection is invalid in electric 
circuits and is also not allowed in PSpice. Another mani-
festation of this invalidity is that a finite voltage differ-
ence, vSRC2 − vSRC1, in this case, divided by zero resistance 
in the circuit, results in an infinite current.
The parallel connection of any number of ideal, 
­independent voltage sources of the same voltage and 
polarity is equivalent to that of a single ideal, indepen-
dent voltage source of the same voltage and polarity 
(Figure 3.23b).
3.5.2  Ideal Current Sources
Concept: Ideal current sources should not be connected in 
series, unless they have the same source current and in the 
same direction. Otherwise, conservation of charge is violated.
Consider two ideal current sources of unequal source 
currents connected in series (Figure 3.24a). Such a connec-
tion evidently violates KCL because iSRC1 − iSRC2 ≠ 0. More 
fundamentally, such a connection violates conservation 
of charge. Thus, iSRC1 C/s enter node ‘a’ between the two 
sources and iSRC2 C/s leave the node. If, for the sake of 
argument, iSRC1 > iSRC2, then iSRC1 − iSRC2 C/s will simply 
vanish at node ‘a’ in violation of conservation of charge. 
Such a connection is invalid in electric circuits and is also 
not allowed in PSpice but for a different reason, namely, 
the occurrence of a ‘floating’ node (Appendix C).
Any number of identical, ideal, independent cur-
rent sources connected in series in the same direction is 
equivalent to a single ideal, independent current source 
of the same current and in the same direction, since the 
terminal current is the same in both cases (Figure 3.24b).
When ideal current sources are connected in parallel, 
the source currents add algebraically. This applies to any 
number of parallel-connected, independent or depen-
dent, ideal current sources of any source current and 
polarity, in any combination. Figure 3.25a illustrates the 
case of two independent sources, whereas Figure 3.25b 
illustrates the case of an independent source and a VCCS

Circuit Equivalence

3.6  Linear-Output Sources
Circuit equivalence was applied in the preceding sec-
tions to combinations of ideal resistors on their own and 
to combinations of ideal sources on their own. Circuit 
equivalence will be applied in this section to linear-
output sources, consisting of an ideal voltage source 
in series with a resistor or an ideal current source in 
­parallel with a resistor. The practical importance of 
­linear-output sources is that they can be used to approx-
imate the behavior of some nonideal sources.
3.6.1  Linear-Output Voltage Source
Voltage sources encountered in practice are nonideal 
in the sense that the voltage across the source termi-
nals decreases as the current delivered by the source 
increases. If this decrease in voltage is directly propor-
tional to the current delivered by the source or can be 
approximated as such, then the nonideal source can 
be represented, between the source terminals, by an 
ideal voltage source of voltage vSRC in series with an 
ideal resistor Rsrc, as illustrated in Figure 3.27a. Rsrc is an 
­integral part of the source, as symbolized by the dashed 
rectangle, and the actual terminals of the nonideal 
source are now ‘ab’. This representation is noteworthy 
in that a combination of two ideal circuit elements is 
used to simulate the behavior of a ­nonideal component.
Since the circuit in Figure 3.27a is a series circuit, KCL 
is automatically satisfied. From Ohm’s law, the voltage 
drop across Rsrc is RsrciL, and KVL gives

(3.40)
vSRC is now termed the open-circuit voltage of the 
source, because it is the voltage that appears between 
the source terminals ‘ab’ when these terminals are 
open-circuited, which makes iL = 0 and vL = vSRC; Rsrc is 
the source resistance looking into terminals ‘ab’ with 
vSRC = 0, that is, with the ideal source element set to zero 
by replacing it with a short circuit. Rsrc is also referred to 
as the internal resistance of the source.
As iL increases from zero, the voltage drop across Rsrc 
increases in direct proportion to iL and subtracts from 
the open-circuit voltage vSRC; vL at the source terminals 
decreases linearly with iL, the slope being −Rsrc, in accor-
dance with Equation 3.40 and illustrated in Figure 3.27b. 
For any set of values vLL and iLL, the vertical segments 
with arrows at both ends (Figure 3.27b) represent vL and 
RsrciLL. These two segments add up to vSRC, in accordance 
with Equation 3.40. If the output terminals are short-
circuited, vL = 0. The current intercept in Figure 3.27b is 
iLSC = vSRC/Rsrc and is termed the short-circuit current at 
these terminals.
Because of the linear vL–iL relation at the source 
­terminals ‘ab’, we will refer to this type of nonideal 
­voltage source as a linear-output voltage source.
Equation 3.40 relates the terminal variables vL and iL to 
the source quantities vSRC and Rsrc only, independently of 
the load. This vL−iL relation is therefore referred to as the 
source characteristic, with Rsrc being the source resis-
tance. If Rsrc = 0, the source characteristic is a horizontal

line having a voltage intercept vSRC. The terminal volt-
age is vSRC, independently of the source current, as for an 
ideal voltage source. This underlies the following con-
cept that we will often use:
Concept: An ideal, independent or dependent, voltage source 
has zero source resistance.
Note that this concept is also in accordance with the 
previous deduction that an ideal voltage source behaves 
as a short circuit if vSRC = 0 (Figure 2.4), since a short 
circuit has zero resistance. We are now asserting that the 
source resistance is still zero when vSRC ≠ 0.
It also follows that an ideal voltage source must not be 
short-circuited, since Rsrc = 0 makes the resulting current 
infinite. In a nonideal source, the source resistance limits 
the short-circuit current.
Practical voltage sources are commonly paralleled. 
This is because any practical voltage source is designed 
to deliver a maximum current or power. When sources 
are paralleled, the total current delivered is the sum of 
the currents delivered by the individual sources, and 
more power can therefore be delivered than by any of the 
individual sources. Generally, paralleled voltage sources 
have nominally the same open-circuit ­voltage and source 
resistance, so they share the load equally.
Primal Exercise 3.18

voltage of 11.7 V is energized by paralleling it with a 
fully charged battery of open-circuit voltage 12.6  V. 
Determine the current that initially flows upon parallel-
ing the two batteries, assuming that each battery has an 
internal, or source, resistance of 45 mΩ and that the con-
necting cables are of negligible resistance.
Ans. 10 A.

supplying 80  A to the engine starter. Determine the 
internal, or source, resistance of the battery. What is 
the resistance of the starter and the connecting cables?
Ans. Battery internal resistance is 50 mΩ; 0.1 Ω.
3.6.2  Linear-Output Current Source
Current sources encountered in practice are nonideal 
in the sense that the voltage across the source termi-
nals decreases as the current delivered by the source 
increases. If this decrease in voltage is directly propor-
tional to the current delivered by the source or can be 
approximated as such, then the nonideal source can 
be  represented, between the source terminals, by an 
ideal current source of current iSRC in parallel with an 
ideal resistor Rsrc (Figure 3.28a).
Since the circuit in Figure 3.28a is a parallel circuit, 
KVL is automatically satisfied. From Ohm’s law, the cur-
rent through Rsrc is vL/Rsrc, so that KCL at node ‘a’ gives 
iSRC = iL + vL/Rsrc. Multiplying both sides of the equation 
by Rsrc and rearranging,
	
 v
R i
R i
L
src SRC
src L
=
–
	
(3.41)
Equation 3.41 is plotted in Figure 3.28b. When vL = 0, 
iL = iSRC and is the current intercept. When iL = 0, the 
voltage intercept is vLOC  =  RsrciSRC and is the open-­
circuit voltage at terminals ‘ab’. The slope of the line 
is −Rsrc, where Rsrc is the source resistance looking into 
­terminals ‘ab’, with iSRC = 0, that is, with the ideal cur-
rent source  set to zero by replacing it with an open 
circuit.
The interpretation of Equation 3.41 is that when iL = 0, 
iSRC flows through Rsrc, producing a voltage drop RsrciSRC 
at the open-circuited terminals ‘ab’. As iL increases from 
zero, it subtracts from iSRC, so less current flows in Rsrc 
and vL is reduced. When terminals ‘ab’ are short-cir-
cuited, vL = 0, no current flows in Rsrc, so that iSRC flows 
through the short circuit. For any set of values vLL and 
iLL, the horizontal segments with arrows at both ends in 
Figure 3.28b represent iLL and vLL/Rsrc.
Because of the linear vL–iL relation at the source 
­terminals ‘ab’, we will refer to this type of nonideal 
current source as a linear-output current source. 
Equation 3.41 relates the terminal variables vL and iL to 
the source parameters iSRC and Rsrc only, independently 
of the load. As in the case of the linear-output voltage 
source, it is referred to as the source characteristic, with 
Rsrc being the source resistance. If iSRC remains constant in 
Figure 3.28b as Rsrc increases, VLoc increases. As Rsrc → ∞, 
the source characteristic becomes a vertical line through 
iSRC. This underlies the following concept that we will 
often use:
Concept: An ideal, independent or dependent, current source 
has zero source conductance or infinite source resistance.

Note that this concept is also in accordance with the 
previous deduction that an ideal current source behaves 
as an open circuit if iSRC = 0 (Figure 2.5), since an open 
circuit has infinite resistance. We are again asserting that 
Rsrc remains infinite when iSRC ≠ 0.
It also follows that an ideal current source must not be 
open-circuited, as the resulting voltage across the source 
is infinite. In a nonideal source, the source resistance 
limits the open-circuit voltage.
Before ending this discussion, it may be noted that 
when a linear-output source is connected to a load 
resistance RL, a simple graphical analysis can be made. 
Figure 3.29a illustrates a linear-output source connected 
to a resistor RL. Figure 3.29b shows the source charac-
teristic for the linear-output source in terms of vL and iL, 
representing the equation

where 
vLOC is the open-circuit voltage at terminals ‘ab’ when 
iL = 0
Rsrc is the source resistance looking into these termi-
nals with the independent source set to zero
ILSC = vLOC/Rsrc is the short-circuit current when vL = 0
Equation 3.42 is independent of RL, depending only 
on the source. However, vL and iL are related by Ohms’ 
applied to RL:
	
v
R i
L
L L
=
	
(3.43)
Equation 3.43 is represented in Figure 3.29b as a line 
of slope RL passing through the origin and referred to as 
the load line. Equations 3.42 and 3.43 are two equations 
in the two unknowns vL and iL. The intersection of the 
two lines representing these equations gives the particu-
lar values of vLL and iLL that are the solution to the two 
equations, because these values satisfy both equations.
3.6.3  Transformation of Linear-Output Sources
An important and useful procedure is the transforma-
tion between a linear-output voltage source and a lin-
ear-output current source. This transformation follows 
from a comparison of Equations 3.40 and 3.41. These 
equations are identical if (1) vSRC = RsrciSRC and (2) Rsrc 
is the same in both cases. Under these conditions, the 
vL–iL relation is the same for both sources at terminals 
‘ab’, which means that the two sources are equivalent 
at these terminals. That is, one type of linear-output 
source can be substituted for the other, terminal for ter-
minal, without affecting the rest of the circuit.
The transformation can be illustrated by a voltage 
source of open-circuit voltage vSRC = 6 V and source resis-
tance Rsrc = 2 Ω connected to some load (Figure 3.30a). 
Equation 3.40 becomes

L

(3.44)
Consider next a current source having iSRC = vSRC/Rsrc = 
6/2 = 3 A, in accordance with the relation vSRC = RsrciSRC 
(Figure 3.30b). The source resistance Rsrc = 2 Ω is in parallel 
with iSRC, as in Figure 3.28a. Equation 3.41 gives vL = 6 – 2iL, 
which is the same as Equation 3.44. This means that the 
two sources are equivalent at terminals ‘ab’. Note that the 
2 Ω source resistance could alternatively be represented as 
a conductance of 0.5 S in parallel with iSRC (Figure 3.30c).
The procedure for transforming a linear-output volt-
age source to an equivalent linear-output current source, 
or conversely, is illustrated in Figure 3.31 and can be 
summarized as follows:
	
1.	To transform a linear-output voltage source of 
open-circuit voltage vSRC to a linear-output ­current 
source, the short-circuit current of the current source 
is given by iSRC = vSRC/Rsrc.
	
2.	To transform a linear-output current source of short-
circuit current iSRC to a linear-output voltage source, 
the open-circuit voltage of the linear-output voltage 
source is given by vSRC = RsrciSRC.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
	
3.	In both cases, the source resistance Rsrc in series with 
the ideal voltage source element is the same Rsrc in 
parallel with the ideal current source element.
The transformation applies to dependent sources 
as well as independent sources, as emphasized in 
Figure  3.31. A  CCVS of voltage ρiX is transformed 
to a CCCS of current (ρ/Rsrc)iX, and conversely. 
Similarly,  a  VCVS of voltage αvY is transformed to a 
VCCS of ­current (α/Rsrc)vY, and conversely.
The following should be noted concerning source 
transformation:
	
1.	Because of circuit equivalence, source transfor-
mation must preserve polarities of voltages and 
directions of currents at the terminals of the two 
sources. To ascertain this in a given circuit, the 
two sources are temporarily disconnected from 
the rest of the circuit, so that iL = 0 in Figure 3.30, 
for example. The assigned positive direction of 
the ideal voltage source element in Figure 3.30a 
makes terminal ‘a’ positive with respect to ter-
minal ‘b’. Similarly, in Figure 3.30b, the assigned 
positive direction of the ideal current source ele-
ment is such that iSRC flowing in Rsrc makes ter-
minal ‘a’ positive with respect to ­terminal ‘b’.
	
2.	The equivalence between the two sources 
applies at the specified terminals only. It does 
not apply inside the sources. For example, the 
power delivered by the ideal source elements is 
quite different in the two cases, as illustrated in 
Example 3.5.
	
3.	An ideal voltage source cannot be transformed 
to an ideal current source, and conversely. Thus, 
Rsrc = 0 for an ideal voltage source, which makes 
iSRC = vSRC/Rsrc → ∞. Similarly, Rsrc → ∞ for an ideal 
current source, which makes vSRC = RsrciSRC → ∞. 
Infinite values of vSRC and iSRC imply that the 
corresponding sources are not valid. This is 
in accordance with ideal voltage and current 
sources being basic circuit elements, where a 
basic circuit element cannot be represented in 
terms of other basic circuit elements, as men-
tioned in Section 1.8. Nonideal sources are not 
basic circuit elements. They can therefore be rep-
resented in terms of basic circuit elements, and 
linear-output voltage sources can be transformed 
to linear-­output current sources, and conversely.
The following deductions follow from the discussion 
of linear-output sources:
	
1.	The ideal termination for a nonideal voltage 
source is an open circuit, in the sense that under 
these conditions, vL = vLOC = vSRC (Equation 3.40). 
In other words, the terminal voltage has its larg-
est value, which is the open-circuit voltage of 
the source. However, the power delivered by 
the source is zero.
	
2.	The ideal termination for a nonideal current 
source is a short circuit, in the sense that under 
these conditions, iL = ILSC = iSRC (Equation 3.41). 
In other words, the terminal current has its larg-
est value, which is the short-circuit current of 
the source. However, the power delivered by 
the source is zero.
	
3.	If vL = RLiL is substituted in Equation 3.40, iL is 
given by

load RL is connected to an ideal current source 
of ­current iSRC  =  vSRC/Rsrc (Figure 3.32a), in 
that the ideal current source delivers iSRC to RL 
independently of RL. In other words, a voltage 
source having R

Example 3.5:  Transformation 
of Linear-Output Sources
Consider a linear-output voltage source of 12 V open-
circuit voltage and 1.5 Ω source resistance supplying a 
4.5 Ω load (Figure 3.33a). It is required to transform this 
source to an equivalent current source, verify that the 
load voltage and current are the same, and show that 
equivalence applies at the source terminals only.
Solution:
The load current in Figure 3.33a is iL = 12/(1.5 + 4.5) = 2 A. 
The load voltage is vL = 4.5 × 2 = 9 V. This also follows 
from voltage division, since vL =

Equivalence does not apply inside the sources. 
Thus, the voltage across the 1.5 Ω resistor in Figure 
3.33a is 3 V, and the power dissipated in it is 6 W. The 
current in the 1.5 Ω resistor in Figure 3.33b is 6 A, and 
the power dissipated in it is 54 W. The power deliv-
ered by the ideal voltage source in Figure  3.33a is 
24 W, whereas the power delivered by ideal current 
source in Figure 3.33b is 72 W. However, the power 
delivered by each source minus the power dissipated 
in the source resistance is the power delivered to the 
load, which must be the same in both cases, because of 
equivalence. Thus, 24 – 6 = 72 – 54 = 18 W = 9 × 2.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 3.34. 
After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in the

Problem-Solving Tip
•	 In source transformation, equivalence does not 
apply inside the sources. This implies that the 
power delivered or absorbed by the ideal source, 
or the power dissipated in the source resistance, is 
not preserved under source transformation.

Example 3.6:  Circuit Analysis Using 
Source Transformation
It is required to determine VO in Figure 3.36.
Solution:
	 1.	 Initialize: All given values and the required VO are 
entered. The nodes are labeled.
	 2.	 Simplify: The ideal current source and the 2 kΩ 
resistor in parallel with it can be transformed to the 
equivalent voltage source, whose source resistance 
can be combined with the 1 kΩ resistance. To ascer-
tain the polarity of the transformed voltage source, 
the ideal current source and its 2 kΩ resistor are iso-
lated from the rest of the circuit, as in Figure 3.37a. 
The 6 mA source current flowing in the 2 kΩ resis-
tor makes node ‘a’ positive with respect to node 
‘b’. Hence, the polarity of the ideal voltage source 
in the transformed linear-output source should be 
as in Figure 3.37b. The justification for isolating the 
sources in order to determine polarity is that the 
transformed sources are equivalent under all termi-
nal conditions, including isolation from the rest of 
the circuit. When the 2 kΩ resistance of the equiv-
alent linear-output voltage source is combined 
with the 1 kΩ resistance, the circuit becomes as in 
Figure 3.38.
	 3.	 Deduce: The current in the 2 kΩ resistor in the ­middle 
is VO/2 mA.
	 4.	 Explore: The circuit is now a two-essential-node cir-
cuit that can be analyzed in terms of KCL. The total 
current leaving node ‘b’ can be expressed in terms 
of VO as

which gives VO = 7.5 V.
	 5.	 Check: An alternative solution is to transform the 
two linear-output voltage sources in Figure 3.38 to 
their equivalent linear-output current sources, as in 
Figure 3.39a. The circuit is now a parallel circuit hav-
ing VO across the paralleled elements. The two ideal 
current sources in parallel and in the same direction 
are combined into a single 10 mA source. Reqp for the 
three resistors is derived by first combining the two 
2 kΩ resistances in parallel into a 1 kΩ resistance

3.7  Problem-Solving Approach Updated
The main procedural steps of the ISDEPIC approach are 
summarized and updated below in the light of the mate-
rial covered in this chapter:
Step 1—Initialize:
	 (a)	 Mark on the circuit diagram all given values of 
circuit parameters, currents, and voltages, as 
well as the unknowns to be determined.
	 (b)	 Label the nodes, as this may be generally 
helpful.
	 (c)	 If the solution requires that a given value of cur-
rent or voltage be satisfied, assume this value 
from the very beginning.
Step 2—Simplify: Consider as may be appropriate
	 (a)	 Redrawing the circuit
	 (b)	 Replacing series and parallel combinations of 
circuit elements by an equivalent circuit element
	 (c)	 Applying star–delta transformation
	 (d)	 Applying source transformation
Step 3—Deduce: Determine any values of current or 
­voltage that follow immediately from direct applica-
tion of Ohm’s law, KCL, or KVL, without introducing 
any additional unknowns. If Step 3 does not provide the 
solution, proceed to Step 4.
Step 4—Explore: Consider the nodes and meshes in 
the circuit to see if KCL or KVL can be expressed 
using a single unknown current or voltage and if 
this unknown can then be directly determined from 
KCL or KVL. If Step 4 does not provide the solution, 
­proceed to Step 5.
Step 5—Plan: Think carefully and creatively about the 
problem in the light of circuit fundamentals and circuit 
analysis techniques. Try to think of alternative solutions 
and select what seems to be the simplest and most direct 
solution.
Step 6—Implement: Carry out your planned solution.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Step 7: Check your calculations and results.
	 (a)	 Check that your results make sense, in terms of 
magnitude and sign.
	 (b)	 Check that Ohm’s law is satisfied across every 
resistor, that KCL is satisfied at every node, and 
that KVL is satisfied around every mesh.
	 (c)	 Seek an alternative solution to see if it gives the 
same results.
	 (d)	 Whenever feasible, check the results with PSpice 
simulation.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 Two circuits are equivalent at a given pair of 
terminals if the circuits have the same voltage–­
current relation at these terminals.
	
1.	 If v and i are the voltage and current at the 
corresponding terminals of two equivalent 
circuits, then the time course of v(t) and i(t) 
is the same, the quotient v/i is the same, and 
the instantaneous power or the product vi is 
the same for both circuits.
•	 In a series connection of resistors:
	
1.	 The equivalent series resistance Reqs is the 
sum of the individual resistances.
	
2.	 The reciprocal of the equivalent series 
­conductance is the sum of the reciprocals of 
the individual conductances.
	
3.	 Reqs is larger than the largest of the series-
connected resistors.
•	 In a series connection of resistors to which a 
voltage v is applied and the voltage across any 
of the individual resistors Rj is denoted by vj, the 
ratio of vj to v is the same as the ratio of Rj to the 
total series resistance.
•	 In a parallel connection of resistors:
	
1.	 The equivalent parallel conductance is the 
sum of the individual conductances.
	
2.	 The reciprocal of the equivalent parallel 
resistance Reqp is the sum of the reciprocals 
of the individual resistances.
	
3.	 Reqp is smaller than the smallest paralleled 
resistance.
•	 In a parallel connection of resistors in which the 
total current is i and the current through any of 
the individual resistors Rj is denoted by ij, the 
ratio of ij to i is the same as the ratio of Gj = 1/Rj 
to the total parallel conductance.
•	 The resistivity, or specific resistance, of a given 
material is the resistance between two opposite 
faces of a cube of the material multiplied by the 
length of the side of the cube. The resistivity of 
a given material is an intrinsic property of the 
material that is indicative of its electrical resis-
tive property. It is independent of the size or 
shape of the conducting material.
•	 The reciprocal of resistivity is conductivity.
•	 Resistance is directly proportional to the length 
of the current path through a conductor and 
inversely proportional to the cross-sectional 
area through which the current flows.
•	 Δ-connected resistors can be substituted for the 
equivalent Y-connected resistors, and conversely, 
terminal for terminal, without affecting the volt-
ages and currents in the rest of the circuit.
•	 Ideal, independent and dependent, voltage 
sources can be connected in series without restric-
tions on the source voltages and polarities. The 
source voltages add algebraically along the path.
•	 Ideal voltage sources should not be paralleled, 
unless they have the same source voltage and 
the same polarity. Otherwise, conservation of 
energy is violated.
•	 Ideal current sources should not be connected 
in series, unless they have the same source cur-
rent and in the same direction. Otherwise, con-
servation of charge is violated.
•	 Ideal, independent and dependent, current 
sources can be connected in parallel without 
restrictions on the source currents and directions. 
The source currents add algebraically at the 
nodes between which the sources are paralleled.
•	 If the voltage at the source terminals of a noni-
deal voltage source decreases linearly with 
the  current delivered by the source, the noni-
deal voltage source can be represented by an 
ideal voltage source in series with an ideal resis-
tor. This series combination is referred to as a 
linear-output voltage source.
	
1.	 The linear-output voltage source is charac-
terized by (a) its open-circuit voltage, which 
is the voltage of the ideal source element, 
and (b) its source resistance, or internal resis-
tance, measured between the source termi-
nals with the ideal voltage source set to zero.
•	 If the voltage at the source terminals of a non­
ideal current source decreases linearly with 
the current supplied by the source, the nonideal 
current source can be represented by an ideal 
current source in parallel with an ideal ­resistor. 
This parallel combination is referred to as a 
­linear-output current source.

Circuit Equivalence	
77
	
1.	 The linear-output current source is charac-
terized by (a) its short-circuit current, which 
is the current of the ideal source element, 
and (b) its source resistance, or internal resis-
tance, measured between the source termi-
nals with the ideal current source set to zero.
•	 A linear-output voltage source of open-circuit 
voltage vSRC and source resistance Rsrc can be 
transformed to a linear-output current source 
of short-circuit current vSRC/Rsrc in parallel with 
Rsrc. Conversely, a linear-output current source 
of short-circuit current iSRC and source resistance 
Rsrc can be transformed to an linear-output volt-
age source of open-circuit voltage RsrciSRC and 
source resistance Rsrc.
	
1.	 The transformation should preserve polari-
ties of voltages and directions of currents at 
the terminals of the two sources.
	
2.	 The transformation applies at the specified 
terminals only and does not apply inside the 
sources.
•	 An ideal, independent or dependent, volt-
age source has zero source resistance, whereas 
an ideal, independent or dependent, current 
source has zero source conductance or infinite 
source resistance.
•	 The ideal termination for a nonideal voltage 
source is an open circuit, whereas the ideal ter-
mination for a nonideal current source is a short 
circuit. However, no power is delivered by the 
sources under these conditions.
•	 A voltage source having R
R
src
L
≫
 approxi-
mates an ideal current source as far as the load 
RL is concerned, since the current through RL is 
almost independent of RL.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	The parallel resistance of more than two resis-
tors is conveniently determined from paralleled 
resistances, two at a time.
	
2.	Never apply voltage division except to resistors in 
series, that is, resistors that carry the same current.
	
3.	In current division the largest current flows in 
the branch having the smallest resistance, and 
conversely.
	
4.	Never apply current division except to resistors 
in parallel.
	
5.	In source transformation, equivalence does not 
apply inside the sources. This implies that the 
power delivered or absorbed by the ideal source, 
or the power dissipated in the source resistance, 
is not preserved under source transformation.

Objective and Overview
The chapter presents some theorems that apply to elec-
tric circuits and that center primarily around Thevenin’s 
theorem.
Thevenin’s theorem takes circuit equivalence to its 
extreme, by representing any LTI circuit, between any 
two given terminals, by a linear-output voltage source 
in the case of resistive circuits. Thevenin’s theorem is 
arguably the most important theorem in circuit analy-
sis, both from theoretical and practical viewpoints. It is 
therefore discussed at length with several examples that 
highlight some of its aspects.
The discussion of Thevenin’s equivalent circuit (TEC) 
is naturally followed by a discussion of its current-
source counterpart, namely, Norton’s equivalent cir-
cuit (NEC). NEC has the added significance that some 
­circuits may have an NEC, but not a TEC, just as the 
converse is also true.
The chapter ends with the substitution theorem, 
which is a useful theorem that simplifies the analysis of 
some types of circuits and can be readily proved using 
Thevenin’s theorem. A particular form of the substitu-
tion theorem, the source absorption theorem, is pre-
sented as a useful tool for replacing dependent sources 
by resistors in some cases, which again simplifies circuit 
analysis in these cases.
Discussion in this chapter and in Chapters 5 and 6 is 
mostly restricted to the dc state.
4.1  Excitation by Dependent Sources
Before presenting Thevenin’s theorem, the following 
concept is discussed:
Concept: Dependent sources alone do not excite a circuit.
To illustrate this concept, consider the circuit of Figure 
4.1. From KCL at the upper essential node,

(4.3)
It follows that vX = 0, which also makes iY = 0.
Although demonstrated for a particular circuit, it is 
true in general that if dependent sources are the only 
sources in a circuit, the circuit is relaxed, that is, all volt-
ages and currents in the circuit are zero.
Although they alone do not excite a circuit, dependent 
sources do, of course, affect the voltages and currents in 
the circuit. But the ultimate source of energy is the inde-
pendent sources in the circuit. In the absence of these 
independent sources, there is no excitation in the circuit.
4.2  Thevenin’s Theorem
In the context of resistive circuits, Thevenin’s theorem 
can be stated as follows:
Statement: A circuit consisting of ideal resistors and sources 
is equivalent, at a specified pair of terminals, to a linear-­output 
voltage source.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The equivalent circuit, consisting of an ideal voltage 
source in series with a resistor, is known as TEC. The 
open-circuit voltage, or the voltage of the ideal voltage 
source element, is referred to as the Thevenin volt-
age, VTh, and the source resistance as the Thevenin 
­resistance, RTh. The open-circuit voltage and source 
resistance were defined for a linear-output voltage 
source in Section 3.6.
Thevenin’s theorem takes circuit equivalence to the 
extreme, in that it reduces any LTI circuit at a given 
pair of terminals to the simplest possible equivalent, 
namely, an ideal voltage source in series with an ideal 
resistor.
Thevenin’s theorem can be illustrated by the sim-
ple voltage divider circuit of Figure 4.2a supplying 
a load RL. The circuit is a two-essential-node circuit 
that can be analyzed using KCL. The current leaving 
node ‘a’ is

Under these conditions, VTh in series with RTh is equiv-
alent to the voltage divider circuit at terminals ‘ab’, since 
they have the same VL−IL relation (Figure 4.2c). RTh is the 
source resistance, and VTh is the open-circuit voltage at 
terminals ‘ab’, when IL = 0.
Although shown to apply for the voltage divider cir-
cuit, Thevenin’s theorem in fact applies to a circuit of 
any complexity consisting of ideal sources and resis-
tors. Evidently, replacing a complex circuit by its TEC 
between a given pair of terminals greatly simplifies the 
analysis of the overall circuit, as will be demonstrated 
on many occasions.
4.2.1  Derivation of TEC
In the preceding discussion, VTh and RTh were deter-
mined by deriving the VL−IL relation at the given pair of 
terminals, which is unnecessarily complicated. A sim-
pler procedure is suggested by the nature of TEC itself 
and the VL−IL relation. Since the plot of VL vs. IL is a 
straight line (Figure 4.2c), this line is uniquely deter-
mined by specifying its slope, whose magnitude is RTh, 
and a point through which the line passes, such as the 
intercept on the voltage axis. This intercept is VTh and 
equals VL, when IL = 0. It can, therefore, be determined 
directly from the circuit as the open-circuit voltage at 
terminals ‘ab’. Thus, if RL is removed from the circuit 
(Figure 4.3a), it follows from voltage division that

(4.9)
The ratio VTh/ISC is, from Equations 4.8 and 4.9, 
R1R2/(R1  +  R2), the same as the expression for RTh in 
Equation 4.7.
The direct method of determining RTh is suggested 
by Figure 4.2b. If VTh is set to zero, that is, replaced by 
a short-circuit (Section 2.4) and a test voltage source 
VT is applied between terminals ‘ab’, then RTh = VT/IT 
(Figure 4.4a). That is, RTh is Req seen by the test source 
between terminals ‘ab’. Alternatively, a test current 
source IT may be applied and RTh is again given by VT/IT 
(Figure 4.4b). But what does setting VTh to zero imply 
in the original circuit? It implies setting all independent 
sources to zero, for this removes excitation from the circuit 
and reduces all currents and voltages in the circuit to 
zero, including VTh. As mentioned in Section 4.1, depen-
dent sources alone do not excite the circuit. Hence, VTh 
becomes zero when all independent sources are set to 
zero while leaving dependent sources unchanged. Note 
that although dependent sources alone do not excite the 
circuit, they do affect the relations between voltages and 
currents in the circuit in the presence of independent 
sources by effectively altering the values of resistances, 
including RTh. Setting dependent sources to zero will 
therefore alter RTh, whereas setting independent sources 
to zero removes excitation from the circuit, without 
altering RTh. Recall that an ideal voltage source is set to 
zero by replacing it with a short circuit (Section 2.4) and 
that an ideal current source is set to zero by replacing it 
with an open circuit (Section 2.5).
It should be noted that applying a test source to 
determine RTh, as in Figure 4.4a and b, is a formal and 
general method of determining Req between any two 
terminals of a circuit, with independent sources set to 
zero. That was, in fact, the method used for determin-
ing Reqs and Reqp in Chapter 3 (Figures 3.3 and 3.5). Using 
a test source is the only generally applicable method for 
determining Req in the presence of dependent sources. 
However, in the absence of dependent sources, a test 
source need not be explicitly applied. Equivalently, Req, 
and hence RTh, can be determined more directly using 
series/parallel combinations of resistors, star-delta 
transformation, etc.
The procedure for deriving TEC can be summarized 
as follows:
	
1.	Determine VTh as the open-circuit voltage at the 
specified terminals.
	
2.	Determine the short-circuit current ISC at the speci-
fied terminals, which gives RTh as VTh/ISC.
	
3.	Set all independent sources in the given circuit to 
zero, leaving dependent sources unchanged. RTh is 
the resistance Req looking into the specified terminals. 
Formally, this resistance is obtained by applying a 
test voltage source or a test current source and deter-
mining Req as the ratio of the voltage at the source 
terminals to the source current. In the absence of 
dependent sources, this effectively reduces to deter-
mining Req directly from series/parallel combinations 
of resistors, and using star-delta transformations, if 
necessary.
The following should be noted concerning this 
procedure:
	
1.	Since VTh = RThISC, only two of the three quanti-
ties in this relation need be determined through 
the aforementioned three steps. However, it is 
useful for checking purposes to determine all 
three of these quantities independently.
	
2.	Moreover, some of the aforementioned three 
steps many be easier to implement than others. 
Thus, setting independent sources to zero can 
make the circuit particularly simple.
	
3.	In some cases, VTh = 0, which means that ISC = 0. 
It follows that VTh/ISC is 0/0, which is indetermi-
nate. In this case, RTh can only be determined by 
Step 3 of the aforementioned procedure. This is 
illustrated by Example 4.3.
	
4.	A potential ambiguity in deriving TEC at a 
pair of terminals is whether or not to include in 
TEC a branch, such as a resistor R, that is con-
nected between the given pair of terminals. The 
ambiguity is resolved in this book by the way 
the resistor is drawn with respect to the given 
terminals or by the way TEC is required. In 
Figure 4.5a, for example, R is drawn beyond the 
terminals at which TEC is required, as was done 
in Figure 4.2a. The implication is that R should 
not be included in TEC. Even without draw-
ing the terminals in this manner,  requiring

90	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
“TEC seen by R,” or “TEC looking into termi-
nals ‘ab’” means that R should not be included in 
TEC. On the other hand, if the given terminals 
are beyond R, as in Figure 4.5b, the implication 
is that R should be included in TEC. Requiring 
“TEC between terminals ‘ab’” is unambiguous 
in this case.
	
5.	Even in the case of Figure 4.5b, it may be advan-
tageous to remove R and determine an interme-
diate TEC from the simpler circuit that results 
when R is removed. After obtaining this TEC, 
R is connected to the terminals of this TEC and 
the final TEC derived. This procedure is illus-
trated by Example 4.4.
	
6.	If RL = RTh (Figure 4.2b), the ideal voltage source 
VTh transfers maximum power to RL. This is 
proved in Section 17.4 and extended to more 
general cases.
★4.2.2  Derivation of TEC with PSpice
Although VTh, ISC, and RTh can be derived from two sep-
arate simulations, it is possible, and more convenient, to 
derive TEC from a single simulation. The basis for this 
procedure is instructive and can be explained with ref-
erence to Figure 4.6a. A test current source IT is applied 
at terminals ‘ab’, between which TEC is to be derived. 
This TEC, consisting of VTh and RTh, is shown between 
these terminals, which signifies that the original circuit 
is left as is, that is, with the independent sources retained, 
so that VTh ≠ 0. KVL gives

(4.10)
If IT is varied between 0 and 1 A, and VT is plotted 
against IT, a straight line graph is obtained having 
a voltage intercept VTh at IT = 0. Let VT1 denote VT at 
IT = 1 A. From Equation 4.10, the difference (VT1 − VTh) 
is numerically equal to RTh when IT = 1 A (Figure 4.6b). 
IT is conveniently varied in PSpice over a desired range 
of values, using the “DC Sweep” feature, as explained 
in Example 4.1.
Example 4.1:   Application of TEC
It is required to determine IL in Figure 4.7 by deriving 
TEC looking into terminals ‘ab’.

When terminals ‘ab’ are open-circuited by removing 
the 50 Ω resistor, the circuit becomes as in Figure 4.8a.

Circuit Theorems	
91
With no current in the 20 Ω resistor, the 6  A source 
current flows through the 30 Ω resistor, produc-
ing a voltage of 180 V across this resistor. From KVL, 
VTh = 20 + 180 = 200 V.
When terminals ‘ab’ are short-circuited, the short-­circuit 
current ISC can be determined by transforming the ideal 
6 A source in parallel with 30 Ω to an ideal voltage source of 
30 × 6 = 180 V in series with 30 Ω, as in Figure 4.8b. ISC now 
flows through the 30 and 20 Ω resistors. Applying KVL, 
starting from node ‘b’ and going clockwise, 180 – 30ISC – 
20ISC + 20 = 0. This gives ISC = 200/50 = 4 A. It ­follows 
that RTh = VTh/ISC = 200/4 = 50 Ω.
Since the circuit does not have dependent sources, it is 
not necessary to apply explicitly a test source and deter-
mine the ratio of the voltage of the test source to the 
current through the source. RTh can be determined in 
this case as Req between terminals ‘ab’, or Rin, the input 
resistance looking into terminals ‘ab’, with independent 
sources set to zero. The 20 V source is replaced by a short 
circuit and the 6 A source is replaced by an open circuit, 
as in Figure 4.9a. The resistance looking into terminals 
‘ab’ is seen to be 30 + 20 = 50 Ω, as determined previ-
ously. TEC between terminals ‘ab’ is therefore a 200 V 
source in series with 50 Ω (Figure 4.9b). When the 50 Ω 
resistor is connected between terminals ‘ab’ IL is given 
by IL = 200/(50 + 50) = 2 A.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 4.10. 
An IDC I2 is connected between terminals ‘ab’ of the 
circuit. Its default value of 0A need not be changed. 
A voltage marker is placed at terminal ‘a’ of the circuit. 
In the Simulation Settings, ‘Analysis type’ is ‘DC Sweep’, 
‘Primary Sweep’ is selected under ‘Options’, ‘Current 
source’ is selected as ‘Sweep variable’, and I2 is entered 
in the ‘Name’ field. ‘Sweep type’ is ‘Linear’, ‘Start value’ 
is 0, ‘End value’ is 1, and ‘Increment’ is 1m, which is 
small enough to give a large number of points (1000) 
and hence a smooth line. When the simulation is run, 
Figure 4.11 is displayed. Cursor 1 is positioned at 1 A 
on the horizontal axis, and cursor 2 is positioned at the 
origin. In the cursor window, VTh is read as Y2 = 200.000, 
and RTh × 1 is read as Y1 – Y2 = 50.000.
Exercise 4.1
Verify that applying a test voltage source or a test ­current 
source in Figure 4.9a gives the same RTh.

Terminals ‘ab’ are open-circuited by removing the 26 Ω 
load, so that VTh is now the voltage between these termi-
nals (Figure 4.13). The 2 A current flows in the 8 Ω resis-
tor between nodes ‘a’ and ‘d’, and Ib flows through the 4 Ω 
resistor and the 4 V source. The current leaving node ‘c’, 
through the CCVS is, from KCL, (Ib – 2). Node ‘d’ can then 
be used to check that KCL is satisfied in the circuit. The 
current entering node ‘d’ is (Ib – 2 + 2) = Ib, the same as 
the current leaving the node. As emphasized previously, 
it is good practice in problem-solving not to use addi-
tional variables and to mark the currents and voltages on 
the circuit diagram. Ib is determined from KVL around 
mesh ‘bcdb’. By going clockwise around this mesh, start-
ing from node ‘b’, KVL gives 4 – 4Ib – 4Ib – 8Ib = 0, so that 
Ib = 4/16 = 0.25 A, and VTh = 8 × 2 + 8 × 0.25 = 18 V. Note 
that there is no point in taking KVL around the mesh 
that includes the 2 A source because the voltage across 
this source is an additional unknown.
When terminals ‘ab’ are short-circuited, the circuit 
becomes as in Figure 4.14. Because Vda  =  Vdb, and the 
resistances in the branches ‘da’ and ‘db’ are equal, it fol-
lows that the current Ida is also Ib. From KCL at node ‘a’, 
the current in the short circuit is ISC = (2 + Ib). From KCL 
at node ‘b’, the current in the branch ‘bc’ is (2 + 2Ib), and 
from KCL at node ‘c’, the current in the CCVS is 2Ib. Again, 
KCL at node ‘d’ can serve as a check on KCL in the circuit. 
By going clockwise around the mesh ‘bcdb’, KVL gives 
4 – 4(2 + 2Ib) – 4Ib – 8Ib = 0. Hence, Ib = −4/20Ib = −0.2 A, so 
that ISC = (2 + Ib) = 1.8 A. It follows that RTh = 18/1.8 = 10 Ω. 
It should be noted that the assigned positive direction of ISC 
should be consistent with that of VTh, in accordance with Ohm’s 
law. Otherwise, the sign of RTh will be incorrect. The positive 
direction of ISC is that of the voltage drop VTh at the open-
circuited terminals. If a resistor is connected across the 
terminals, the positive direction of current through the 
resistor is that of a voltage drop between the terminals. 
Reducing the resistance to zero will not change the posi-
tive direction of current. It follows that the positive direc-
tion of ISC is that of a voltage drop VTh.
To determine RTh by applying a test source, the indepen-
dent sources are set to zero, so that the 4 V source is replaced 
by a short circuit and the 2 A source by an open circuit, as 
shown in Figure 4.15. With a 1 A test source applied, KCL 
is satisfied at node ‘d’ by having a current (1 – Ib) leaving 
this node through the CCVS and the 4 Ω resistor. Node 
‘b’ can be used to check KCL. By going clockwise around 
the mesh ‘bcdb’, KVL gives 4(1 – Ib) – 4Ib – 8Ib = 0. Hence, 
Ib = 4/16 = 0.25 A, and VT = 8 × 1 + 8 × 0.25 = 10 V. It follows 
that RTh = (10 V)/(1 A) = 10 Ω, as before.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 4.16. 
Proceeding as in Example 4.1, Figure 4.17 is displayed 
when the simulation is run. It is seen that VTh = 18 V and 
RTh = 10 Ω.

Problem-Solving Tip
•	 In deriving TEC, the assigned positive direction of 
ISC should be in the direction of the voltage drop 
VTh so as to obtain the correct sign of RTh = VTh/ISC, 
in accordance with Ohm’s law.
Exercise 4.2
Determine RTh in Figure 4.15 by applying a 1  V test 
source rather than a 1 A source.
Example 4.3:  Derivation of TEC for a Bridge Circuit
It is required to derive TEC seen by the 25 Ω resistor in 
Figure 4.18a.
Solution:
As mentioned previously, the circuit configuration is a 
bridge circuit, since the 25 Ω resistor between nodes ‘b’ 
and ‘c’ is a “crossover” element, like a bridge. To derive 
TEC seen by the 25 Ω resistor, the resistor is removed 
and Vbc determined (Figure 4.18b). The voltages Vbd 
and Vcd in Figure 4.18b can be determined from volt-
age division, since the 10 Ω resistor is in series with the 
15  Ω resistor, and the 20 Ω resistor is in series with 
the 30 Ω resistor. Hence, Vbd = 5 × 30/(20 + 30) = 3 V, and 
Vcd = 5 × 15/(10 + 15) = 3 V.
When the two middle nodes of the bridge circuit 
are at the same voltage, that is, Vbd  =  Vcd, the bridge 
is said to be “balanced,” as is discussed more fully in 
Appendix 5A.
With the bridge balanced, VTh  =  Vbc  =  Vbd – Vcd  =  0. 
Moreover, when nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’ are at the same volt-
age, then the current through any resistor connected 
between these nodes is zero, because there is no voltage 
to drive such a current. The current remains zero as the 
resistance is reduced to zero, that is, when nodes ‘b’ and 
‘c’ are short-circuited. It follows that ISC = 0. However, 
having VTh and ISC equal to zero does not mean that 
RTh = 0, because RTh = VTh/ISC is indeterminate and could 
be finite.
To determine RTh, therefore, the resistance looking into 
terminals ‘bc’ should be derived, with the independent 
voltage source set to zero, that is, replaced by a short 
circuit (Figure 4.19a). To make it easier to visualize 
the connections, it is helpful to redraw the circuit as in 
Figure 4.19b after relocating the short circuit between the 
two resistive branches. Clearly, the resistance between 
nodes ‘c’ and ‘b’ is (10‖15 + 20‖30) = 18 Ω. With VTh = 0, 
TEC reduces to an 18 Ω resistor.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 4.20. 
Proceeding as in Example 4.1, Figure 4.21 is displayed 
when the simulation is run. It is seen that VTh = 0 and 
RTh = 18 Ω.
Example 4.4:  Application of TEC
It is required to determine IX in Figure 4.22 using TEC.
Solution:
TEC will be derived in two steps. The first step is to deter-
mine TEC as seen by the 3 A source in parallel with the 6 Ω 
resistor, as illustrated in Figure 4.23a. The motivation for 
this step is that the parallel ­combination of the 3 A source 
and the 6 Ω resistor is connected between the terminals 
where TEC is required. Under these conditions, this paral-
lel combination can be temporarily removed, resulting in 
a considerably simpler circuit for which an intermediate 
TEC can be derived more easily. The 3 A source is then 
added to this intermediate TEC and a new TEC derived, 
from which IX is determined by adding the 6 Ω resistor.
It is seen from voltage division in Figure 4.23a that 
Vac = 9 × 6/9 = 6 V, and Vbc = 9 × 3/9 = 3 V. It follows that 
VTh1 = Vac − Vbc = 6 − 3 = 3 V. RTh1 is most easily found by 
determining the resistance between terminals ‘ab’ with 
the 9 V source set to zero, that is, replaced by a short 
circuit. This makes RTh1 = Rab = (6‖3) + (6‖3) = 2 + 2 = 4 Ω. 
The intermediate TEC will therefore consist of VTh1 = 3 V 
in series with RTh1 = 4 Ω (Figure 4.23b).
The next step is to connect the 3  A current source 
and derive a second TEC as seen by the 6 Ω resistor 
(Figure 4.24a). The 3 A current now flows through the 
3 V source and the 4 Ω resistor, so that the open-circuit 
voltage Vab = VTh2 = 3 + 12 = 15 V. When the 3 A source 
is replaced by an open circuit and the 3 V source by a 
short circuit, the resistance seen between terminals ‘ab’ 
is RTh2 = Rab = 4 Ω as before (Figure 4.24b). When the 
6 Ω resistor is connected to terminals ‘ab’, IX that flows is 
15/(6 + 4) = 1.5 A (Figure 4.24c).
Simulation: Although the current IX can be derived 
directly by simulating the circuit of Figure 4.22 with-
out invoking TEC, it is instructive to derive by simu-
lation TEC as seen by the 6 Ω resistor. The circuit is 
entered as in Figure 4.25. Proceeding as in Example 4.1, 
Figure 4.26 is displayed when the simulation is run. It 
is seen that VTh = 15 V and RTh = 4 Ω, as determined 
previously.

Problem-Solving Tips
•	 When a voltage or a current in a circuit is required, 
it can often be conveniently ­determined by deriving 
TEC at the terminals associated with this voltage or 
current.
•	 In deriving TEC, it is often advantageous to tem-
porarily remove elements that appear in parallel 
or in series with the terminals between which TEC 
is required, derive an intermediate TEC, and then 
restore the removed elements to this intermediate 
TEC in order to derive the final TEC.

4.3  Norton’s Theorem
In the context of resistive circuits, Norton’s theorem can 
be stated as follows:
Statement: A circuit consisting of ideal resistors and sources 
is equivalent, at a specified pair of terminals, to a linear-­output 
current source.
It is seen that NEC is in fact the linear-output current 
source equivalent of TEC. The two equivalent circuits 
are related by source transformation, as illustrated in 
Figure 4.30. The ideal current source IN is referred to 
as Norton’s current and is the short-circuit current of 
TEC, that is, VTh/RTh, in accordance with source trans-
formation. The source resistance that is in parallel 
with IN is Norton’s resistance RN and is the same as 
RTh in TEC.
It is sometimes more convenient to derive NEC rather 
than TEC, as in Example 4.5. Moreover, some circuits 
may have an NEC but not a TEC, or conversely, as in the 
case of ideal voltage sources and ideal current sources. 
Thus, an ideal voltage source can be considered to be its 
own TEC, with RTh = 0. IN = VTh/0 → ∞, which means that 
NEC does not exist. Similarly, an ideal current source 
can be regarded as its own NEC, with RN infinite, so that 
VTh → ∞, which means that TEC does not exist. This is 
in accordance with the fact that an ideal voltage source 
cannot be transformed to an ideal current source, and 
conversely, as explained in Section 3.6. Circuits that have 
TEC but not NEC generally reduce to an ideal voltage 
source between the terminals involved, whereas circuits 
that have NEC but not TEC generally reduce to an ideal 
current source between these terminals. Examples of 
these are given in the problems at the end of the chapter.
The procedure for deriving NEC is essentially the 
same as that for TEC. When independent sources are set 
to zero in Figure 4.30, the ideal voltage source in TEC is 
replaced by a short circuit and the ideal current source 
in NEC is replaced by an open circuit. The resistance 
looking into terminals ‘ab’ is RTh = RN in both cases. In 
the case of TEC, VTh is generally determined directly, 
and the short-circuit current, IN, is determined as an 
alternative method for finding RTh. In the case of NEC, 
IN is generally determined directly, and the open-circuit 
voltage, VTh, is determined as an alternative method for 
finding RN.
★4.3.1  Derivation of NEC with PSpice
NEC can be derived in a single simulation, analogous to 
that described for TEC, and explained in Figure 4.31a.

If VT is varied between 0 and 1 V, and IT is plotted 
against VT, a straight line graph is obtained having a 
current intercept IN at VT = 0. The difference between IT1, 
which is IT at VT = 1 V, and IN is numerically equal to GN 
(Figure 4.31b). VT is conveniently varied in PSpice over a 
desired range of values, using the “DC Sweep” feature.
Example 4.5:  Application of NEC
It is required to determine IL in Figure 4.32 using NEC.
Solution:
When terminals ‘ab’ are short-circuited, VX = 0 and the 
VCVS becomes a short circuit (Figure 4.33a). To clarify 
the evaluation of ISC, the circuit can be redrawn as in 
Figure 4.33b. It is seen that the 15 and 10 Ω resistors are 
in parallel, so that current division can be applied to the 
5 A source. Accordingly, the currents in these two resis-
tors are 2 and 3 A as shown. IS = −2 A and the CCCS 
becomes 6 A directed upward. It follows from KCL that 
ISC = IN = 3 + 6 = 9 A. Note that the 6 A source current 
only adds to the current in the short circuit between 
nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’ in Figure 4.33a and does not affect cur-
rent division.
To determine RN, a test source IT is applied, with the 5 A 
current source replaced by an open circuit (Figure 4.34).

The voltage Vab is 90 V, as in Figure 4.35b where

open-circuit voltage in Figure 4.32 in order to work 
with TEC is slightly more complicated than determin-
ing IN as in Figure 4.33a (Exercise 4.7).
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 4.36, in 
accordance with the method explained in connection 
with Figure 4.31. The 50 Ω resistor is included in order 
to facilitate finding IL, as explained later, but could be left 
out for the purpose of determining NEC between termi-
nals ‘ab’. Note the alternative way of connecting depen-
dent sources in Figure 4.35 in order to avoid making the 
somewhat awkward connections to the control terminals 
of dependent sources. This is to label the appropriate 
nodes using the net alias feature of PSpice, as described 
in Appendix C. PSpice considers nodes having the same 
label to be ­connected together, as shown in Figure 4.36. A 
DC sweep is performed as described in Example 4.1 but 
sweeping a voltage source instead of a current source. 
The DC sweep gives the plot of Figure 4.37, from which, 
IN = 9 A and RN = 1/0.1 = 10 Ω, this being the parallel 
resistance of 12.5 and 50 Ω (Figure 4.35b). IL is deter-
mined from Vab = 9 × 10 = 90 V in Figure 4.35a and b. 
It follows from Figure 4.35a that IL = 90/50 = 1.8 A.

4.4  Substitution Theorem
Consider a circuit ‘N’ connected at terminals ‘ab’ 
to a ­circuit ‘NA’ having a designated voltage VA 
across ‘ab’ (Figure 4.41a), where VA could be of known 
or unknown value. Let IX be the current flowing from 
‘N’ to ‘NA’. According to the substitution theorem, ‘NA’ 
can be replaced by an independent voltage source VA 
(Figure 4.41b), without affecting IX. This can be readily 
justified if ‘N’ is represented between terminals ‘ab’ by 
its TEC, as in Figure 4.41c and d. It is evident from these 
figures that KVL is the same in both cases, namely,

In other words, replacing ‘NA’ by an independent volt-
age source VA does not affect  ‘N’, since IX remains the 
same.
Similarly, suppose that ‘NA’ has a designated current 
IA at the common terminals ‘ab’ (Figure 4.42a), where 
IA could be of known or unknown value. Let VX be the 
voltage across terminals ‘ab’. According to the substitu-
tion theorem, an independent current source IA can be 
substituted for ‘NA’ (Figure 4.42b), without affecting VX. 
Again, this can be justified if ‘N’ is represented between 
terminals ‘ab’ by its TEC, as in Figure 4.42c and d. It is 
evident from these figures that KVL is the same in both 
cases and gives

without affecting the rest of the circuit. Similarly, a circuit 
having a designated current I through it can be replaced 
by an ideal, independent current source I, without affect-
ing the rest of the circuit. The designated V or I could be a 
numerical value, or V and I could be symbols for unknown 
values.
There is no restriction on the nature of the circuit 
‘NA’ that is being replaced by an independent source. 
It could be a single resistor, a dependent source, or any 
valid combination of independent sources, dependent 
sources, and resistors. In fact, according to the substi-
tution theorem, a designated voltage between any two 
nodes in a circuit can be replaced by an ideal voltage 
source of the same voltage as the designated voltage. 
Similarly, a current in any branch in a circuit can be 
replaced by an ideal ­current source of the same current 
as the designated current. The substitution theorem is 
illustrated by Example 4.6; it is particularly useful in 
connection with superposition, discussed in the follow-
ing chapter.
Exercise 4.11
Justify the substitution theorem by replacing circuit N 
by its NEC: (a) in Figure 4.41 and (b) in Figure 4.42.
Example 4.6:  Application of Substitution Theorem
Given a known bridge circuit connected to a circuit 
‘NA’ of unknown component values, as illustrated in 
Figure 4.43. The bridge circuit is inaccessible for mea-
surements, but the voltage across ‘NA’ can be measured 
by means of a voltage-measuring device (a voltmeter) 
and is found to be 15 V, of the polarity indicated. It is 
required to determine IS, the current drain on the 6 V 
battery.
Solution:
This may look like an impossible problem, but IS 
can be readily determined by means of the substitu-
tion theorem. According to this theorem, ‘NA’ can be 
replaced by a 15  V independent source, without dis-
turbing the circuit (Figure 4.44a). IS can be conveniently 
determined by deriving TEC between terminals ‘ad’ 
(Figure 4.44b). VTh = Vad = Vab + Vbd. From voltage divi-
sion, Vab =

9 V, and Vbd =

10 V. 
It follows that VTh = Vad = −9 + 10 = 1 V.
RTh is determined as Req between terminals ‘a’ and 
’d’ with the 15  V source set to zero (Figure  4.45a), 
which makes nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’ one and the same. 
The resistance between terminals ‘a’ and ‘b’ is

which gives IS = 5/20 = 0.25 A. Note that deriving TEC 
for the bridge circuit in Figure 4.44b illustrates a use-

resistor without affecting Vab.
Ans. (a) 5 V, with node ‘a’ positive with respect to ‘b’; 
(b) 1 A directed from node ‘a’ to ‘b’.
4.5  Source Absorption Theorem
The source absorption theorem is a special case of the 
substitution theorem that can be usefully applied in 
some cases involving dependent sources, particularly 
in transistor circuits. In the definition of dependent 
sources (Section 2.6), it was stated that the controlling 
variable is a current or voltage elsewhere in the circuit, 
which excludes the controlling variable being that of 
the source itself, or a quantity proportional to it. In 
these cases, the dependent source can be conveniently 
replaced by a resistor.
Concept: If a direct proportionality exists between the volt-
age across a dependent source and the source current, the 
dependent source can be replaced by a resistor having a resis-
tance equal to the ratio of the voltage across the source to the 
source current.
To justify this, consider the dependent voltage source 
of Figure 4.48a, where the source voltage is proportional 
to the current through the source, V = ρI. If the depen-
dent source is replaced by a resistor having R = ρI/I = ρ, 
then for the same I through the two circuit elements, 
the voltage V across them is the same. The dependent 
voltage source having V = ρI is therefore equivalent to a 
resistor R and can be replaced by this resistor between 
the same terminals.
The dependent current source of Figure 4.48b has I = σV, 
where V is the voltage across the source. The source can 
be replaced by a resistor having R = V/σV = 1/σ. The two 
circuit elements are equivalent since, for the same volt-
age across them, the current through them is the same.
Note that in Figure 4.48a and b, a positive value of 
R corresponds to having the current in the dependent 
source in the direction of a voltage drop across the

source. If the current through the source is in the direc-
tion of a voltage rise across the source, the ­resistance is 
negative. Just as a positive resistance ­dissipates power, a 
negative resistance does the opposite; it delivers power. 
In this sense, it acts as source, but it differs from an ideal 
source in that it has a finite, ­nonzero resistance. Recall 
that an ideal voltage source has zero resistance, whereas 
an ideal current source has infinite resistance.
Example 4.7:  Output Resistance of Transistor Circuit
A case that is often encountered in transistor circuits is 
that of Figure 4.49a, where Req between terminals ‘ab’ is 
required.
Solution:
The current source gmvx is transformed to a volt-
age source gmvxro in series with ro (Figure 4.49b). The 
­current i through Rx is vx/Rx, which makes the source 
voltage gmvxro proportional to the current vx/Rx through 
the source. The dependent source can therefore be 
replaced by a resistance whose value is the source volt-
age divided by the source current. This resistance is 
(gmvxro)/(vx/Rx)  =  gmroRx; Req between terminals ‘ab’ is 
then the sum of the three resistances in Figure 4.49c:

Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 4.50 
using Rx = 1 kΩ, ro = 200 kΩ, and gm = 4 mA/V. A 1 μA dc 
current source is applied so that the voltage across the 
source in volts is numerically equal to the resistance 
in megohms seen by the source. After selecting ‘Bias 
Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in the simulation profile 
and running the simulation, pressing the V button dis-
plays the voltages indicated in Figure 4.50. It is seen that 
Req = 1.001 MΩ, in accordance with Equation 4.18.

summarized and updated as follows in the light of the 
material covered in this chapter:
Step 1—Initialize:
	 (a)	 Mark on the circuit diagram all the given values 
of circuit parameters, currents and voltages, as 
well as the unknowns to be determined.
	 (b)	 Label the nodes, as this may be generally 
helpful.
	 (c)	 If the solution requires that a given value of cur-
rent or voltage be satisfied, assume this value 
from the very beginning.

Step 2—Simplify: Consider, as may be appropriate:
	 (a)	 Redrawing the circuit.
	 (b)	 Replacing series and parallel combinations of 
circuit elements by an equivalent circuit element.
	 (c)	 Applying star-delta transformation.
	 (d)	 Applying source transformation.
	 (e)	 Using TEC or NEC to simplify part of the circuit. 
In applying TEC or NEC, remove temporarily any 
elements in series or in parallel with the given ter-
minals and derive an intermediate TEC or NEC.
	 (f)	 Applying the source absorption theorem.
Step 3—Deduce: Determine any values of current or volt-
age that follow immediately from direct application of 
Ohm’s law, KCL, or KVL, without introducing any addi-
tional unknowns. If Step 3 does not provide a solution, 
proceed to Step 4.
Step 4—Explore: Examine each of the following alterna-
tives, as may be applicable:
	 (a)	 Consider the nodes and meshes in the circuit 
to see if KCL or KVL can be expressed using a 
single unknown current or voltage and if this 
unknown can then be directly determined from 
KCL or KVL.
	 (b)	 Use TEC or NEC to determine a voltage or a 
current through a given circuit element.
	 (c)	 Apply the substitution theorem.
If Step 4 does not provide the solution, proceed to 
Step 5.
Step 5—Plan: Think carefully and creatively about the 
problem in the light of circuit fundamentals and circuit 
analysis techniques. Consider alternative solutions and 
select what seems to be the simplest and most direct 
solution.
Step 6—Implement: Carry out your planned solution.
Step 7: Check your calculations and results.
	 (a)	 Check that your results make sense, in terms of 
magnitude and sign.
	 (b)	 Check that Ohm’s law is satisfied across every 
resistor, that KCL is satisfied at every node, and 
that KVL is satisfied around every mesh.
	 (c)	 Seek an alternative solution to see if it gives the 
same result.
	 (d)	 Whenever feasible check the results with PSpice 
simulation.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 Dependent sources alone do not excite a circuit. 
They affect currents and voltages in the circuit 
by effectively modifying the values of some 
resistances in the circuit.
•	 Thevenin’s Theorem: A circuit consisting of 
ideal resistors and sources is equivalent, at a 
specified pair of terminals, to a linear-output 
voltage source. The voltage of the ideal voltage 
source element is referred to as the Thevenin 
voltage, VTh, and the source resistance as the 
Thevenin resistance, RTh.
•	 VTh is determined as the open-circuit voltage at 
the specified terminals. RTh can be determined 
as VTh/ISC, where ISC is the short-circuit current 
between the specified terminals.
•	 The procedure for deriving TEC can be summa-
rized as follows:
	
1.	 Determine VTh as the open-circuit voltage at 
the specified terminals.
	
2.	 Determine the short-circuit current ISC at 
the specified terminals, which gives RTh as 
VTh/ISC.
	
3.	 Set all independent sources in the given 
circuit to zero, leaving dependent sources 
unchanged. RTh is the resistance Req looking 
into the specified terminals. Formally, this 
resistance is obtained by applying a test volt-
age source or a test current source and deter-
mining Req as the ratio of the voltage at the 
source terminals to the source current. In the 
absence of dependent sources, this effectively 
reduces to determining Req directly from 
series/parallel combinations of resistors, and 
using star-delta transformations, if necessary.
•	 Norton’s Theorem: A circuit consisting of ideal 
resistors and sources is equivalent, at a specified 
pair of terminals, to a linear-output current source.
•	 NEC follows from TEC through source 
transformation.
•	 According to the substitution theorem, a ­circuit 
having a designated voltage V across it can 
be replaced by an ideal, independent voltage 
source V, without affecting the rest of the circuit. 
Similarly, a circuit having a designated current I 
through it can be replaced by an ideal, indepen-
dent current source I, without ­affecting the rest 
of the circuit. The designated V or I could be a 
numerical value, or V and I could be symbols 
for unknown values.

104	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
•	 There is no restriction on the nature of the cir-
cuit that is being replaced by an independent 
voltage or current source in accordance with 
the substitution theorem. It could be a single 
resistor, a dependent source, or any valid com-
bination of independent sources, dependent 
sources, and resistors.
•	 If a direct proportionality exists between the 
voltage across a dependent source and the 
source current, the dependent source can be 
replaced by a resistor having a resistance equal 
to the ratio of the voltage across the source to 
the source current. The resistance value is posi-
tive when the source current is in the direction 
of a voltage drop across the source.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	In deriving TEC, the assigned positive direc-
tion of ISC should be in the direction of the volt-
age drop VTh so as to obtain the correct sign of 
RTh = VTh/ISC, in accordance with Ohm’s law.
	
2.	When a voltage or a current in a circuit is 
required, it can often be conveniently deter-
mined by deriving TEC at the terminals associ-
ated with this voltage or current.
	
3.	Use TEC to simplify a circuit as part of the solu-
tion to a given problem.
	
4.	In deriving TEC it is often advantageous to 
temporarily remove elements that appear 
in parallel or in series with the terminals 
between which TEC is required, derive an 
intermediate TEC, then restore the removed 
elements to this intermediate TEC in order to 
derive the final TEC.

Objective and Overview
This chapter is concerned with various procedures 
and techniques that simplify circuit analysis, either by 
reducing a given circuit to a simpler form or by fol-
lowing certain methodologies that facilitate obtaining 
the desired circuit response. We have already encoun-
tered circuit simplification in previous chapters, as in 
the equivalent series or parallel connections of resis-
tors, star-delta transformation, and Thevenin’s equiva-
lent circuit (TEC). However, the main objective in these 
cases was pursuing circuit equivalence rather than cir-
cuit simplification per se. By the end of this chapter, all 
the main circuit simplification techniques would have 
been presented.
The chapter begins with the fundamental concept of 
superposition, its implications, and its application in 
circuit analysis, including the use of the substitution 
theorem in conjunction with superposition. This is fol-
lowed by the method of output scaling, according to 
which a convenient output is arbitrarily assumed, and 
voltages and currents are determined by working back-
ward toward an applied source, then scaling all voltages 
and currents in accordance with the value of this source. 
Output scaling is followed by the technique of removal 
of redundant elements, which are elements that either 
do not carry current or do not affect the responses of 
interest.
Two other simplification techniques, discussed next, 
are partitioning of circuits by sources and source rear-
rangement. These techniques can simplify the analysis 
of some types of circuits and provide useful insight into 
their behavior. The chapter ends by considering circuits 
that possess symmetry of a form that can be exploited to 
greatly simplify the analysis.
5.1  Superposition
Definition: If an input x1 to a given system produces an out-
put y1 and an input x2 produces an output y2, then the system 
obeys superposition if an input (x1 + x2), that is, the sum of 
the two inputs, produces an output (y1 + y2), that is, the sum 
of the outputs due to each input acting alone. The same applies 
for more than two inputs.
Superposition is a defining property of linear systems, 
as it is an essential attribute of linearity. Consider, for 
example, an ideal resistor that obeys Ohm’s law, v = Ri. 
With R being constant, this is a linear relation in v and i. 
A current i1 produces a voltage v1 = Ri1, and a current i2 
produces a voltage v2 = Ri2. The voltage produced by a 
current (i1 + i2) is

(5.1)
It is seen that superposition is obeyed in this case 
because of linearity of Ohm’s law. On the other hand, if 
v = ki2, where k is a constant, the v–i relation is not linear.

Superposition is not obeyed in this case, because the 
nonlinearity introduces an additional nonlinear product 
term 2ki1i2.
To see how superposition can be applied in circuit 
analysis, consider the simple two-essential-node circuit 
of Figure 5.1, in which it is required to determine VX. It is 
assumed that VSRC and ISRC are given, but their symbols 
will be retained to begin with. KCL at node ‘a’ gives

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
It is seen that VX is the sum of two components VX1 
and VX2, where VX1  =  (2/3)VSRC is due to VSRC acting 
alone, with ISRC = 0, and VX2 = (10/3)ISRC is due to ISRC 
acting alone, with VSRC = 0. This suggests that VX1 can be 
obtained from the circuit by setting ISRC = 0, that is, replac-
ing the current source with an open circuit, as in Figure 
5.2a. From voltage division, VX1 is indeed (2/3)VSRC. 
Similarly, if VSRC is set to zero, by replacing the voltage 
source with a short circuit, as in Figure 5.2b, VX2 is indeed 
(50/15)ISRC = (10/3)ISRC. It follows that VX in Figure 5.1 
can be obtained by applying each independent source 
alone, with the other independent source set to zero.
The preceding argument illustrates the essence of 
using superposition in circuit analysis and can be gener-
alized to a circuit containing any number of independent 
sources. The desired variable is the sum of components, 
each of which is obtained by applying one independent 
source at a time, with the other independent sources set 
to zero. Evidently, the advantage of this procedure is 
that the circuit resulting from applying one source at a 
time is simpler to analyze than the original circuit.
Superposition can be defined in slightly more gen-
eral terms than stated earlier. A system is said to obey 
superposition if an input (ax1 + bx2) produces an output 
(ay1 + by2), where a and b are constants, y1 is the response 
to x1 acting alone, and y2 is the response to x2 acting 
alone. LTI circuits satisfy both definitions. For in an LTI 
circuit, multiplying an input acting alone by a constant 
multiplies the output due to this input by the same con-
stant, as can be seen from Equation 5.4. Hence, ax1 and 
bx2 can be considered as two inputs ¢x1 and ¢x2 that pro-
duce outputs ¢ =
y
ay
1
1 and ¢ =
y
by
2
2, respectively, so that 
the sum of the two inputs produces an output that is the 
sum of the two outputs.
Example 5.1:   Governing Relation 
for Zener Diode Circuit
A voltage regulator diode, or Zener diode, is commonly 
used to supply a variable load current at a nominally 
constant voltage from an unregulated dc voltage sup-
ply that may vary between specified limits. The diode 
can be represented over its normal operating range by a 
linear-output voltage source consisting of a battery VZ0 
in series with a resistance rZ. The diode is shown con-
nected in parallel with the load RL in Figure 5.3a and is 
supplied from the unregulated dc supply VI through a 
series resistor, RS. It is required to derive an expression 
for the load voltage VL as a function of VI, VZ0, and IL, in 
terms of RS and rZ.
Solution:
The required relation can be readily derived using 
superposition and the substitution theorem. The circuit 
is shown in Figure 5.3b, where, according to the sub-
stitution theorem, VI, as a designated voltage between 
two nodes, is represented by a battery and RL is replaced 
by an independent current source IL. Superposition can 
then be applied to VL with each of the independent 
sources alone, while the other sources set to zero.
Applying VI alone (Figure 5.4a) gives, by voltage 
division,

Equation 5.10 is of the same form as Equation 5.4, but 
with the resistive coefficients of VSRC and ISRC modified 
by ρ. The dependent source does not contribute a com-
ponent to VX, as do VSRC and ISRC. This is consistent with 
the conclusion in Section 4.1, that dependent sources 
alone do not excite a circuit. Note that the modification 
of resistances by dependent sources is in accordance 
with the special case exemplified by the source absorp-
tion theorem (Section 4.5), whereby the dependent 
source is itself replaced by a resistance.
The fact that Equation 5.10 is of the same form as 
Equation 5.4 indicates that superposition can be applied 
in the same manner, by applying VSRC and ISRC one at 
a time, while keeping the dependent source in place. 
In Figure 5.8a, with ISRC replaced by an open circuit, 
KVL gives VSRC – 5IS1 – ρIS1 – 10IS1  =  0 or IS1  =  VSRC/
(15 + ρ). Moreover, VX1 = VSRC – 5IS1. Substituting for IS1 
gives VX1 = VSRC(10 + ρ)/(15 + ρ), as in Equation 5.10. If 
VSRC = 12 V, ISRC = 2 A, and ρ = 5, then VX1 = 9 V.
In Figure 5.8b, with VSRC replaced by a short circuit, KVL 
around the outer loop gives 5IS2 + ρIS2 + 10(IS2 + ISRC) = 0. 
From Ohm’s law, VX2 = −5IS2. Substituting for IS2 gives 
VX2  =  50ISRC/(15  +  ρ), as in Equation 5.6. Substituting 
numerical values, VX2 = 5 V, so that VX = VX1 + VX2 = 14 V.
Comparing Figures 5.2 and 5.8, it is seen that the pres-
ence of the dependent source increases the ­complexity of 
the circuits involving one independent source at a time. 
These circuits become much simpler if the dependent 
source can also be treated like an independent source. 
Can this be done? The answer is yes, using the substitu-
tion theorem. For according to this theorem, a dependent 
voltage source of designated voltage ρIS can be replaced 
by an independent voltage source of the same voltage. 
This is done in Figure 5.9, where the dependent source 
has been replaced by an independent source VY that is 
assumed to have the same numerical value as ρIS. Clearly, 
if IS is known, replacing the dependent source ρIS by an 
independent source VY of the same source voltage does 
not change the values of the voltages and currents in the 
circuit. But since IS is not known, VY can be considered at 
this stage to be just a symbol, like VSRC and ISRC. We will 
now show that the same VX is obtained as before.
Although superposition can be applied to the 
required variable VX, it is generally simpler and more 
syste­matic, when replacing a dependent source by 
an independent source, to apply superposition to 
the controlling ­variable of the dependent source, 
which is IS in this case. The procedure is illustrated 
in Figure  5.10. If VSRC is applied alone, with ISRC and

VY set to zero, the circuit becomes as in Figure 5.10a, 
from which it follows that IS1 = 12/15 = 4/5 A. If ISRC 
is applied alone, with VSRC and VY set to zero, the cir-
cuit becomes as in Figure 5.10b, from which it follows 
that IS2 = −2 × (10/15) = −4/3 A. Finally, VSRC and ISRC 
are set to zero with VY applied, as in Figure 5.10c. It is 
seen from this figure that IS3 = −VY/15. It follows from

Substituting VY = 5IS and solving for IS give IS = −2/5 A. 
In the original circuit, VX  =  12 – 5IS. Substituting for 
IS gives VX  =  14  V, as before. Evidently, replacing the 
dependent source by an independent source simplifies 
the application of superposition, as it leads to simpler 
circuits for determining the individual components of 
the variable in question.
Although the preceding discussion is based on a 
specific circuit, the conclusions apply to LTI circuits in 
general.

Ans. 16 V.
5.1.2  Procedure for Applying Superposition
The procedure for applying superposition in the absence 
of dependent sources can be summarized as follows:
	
1.	Select the desired voltage or current response as 
the circuit variable to which superposition will be 
applied.
	
2.	A component of the desired response is obtained 
with each independent source acting alone, while the 
remaining independent sources are set to zero.
	
3.	The desired response is the algebraic sum of the 
­individual components.
In the presence of a single dependent source, the pro-
cedure for applying superposition can be summarized 
as follows:
	
1.	Replace the dependent source with an independent 
source of unknown value.
	
2.	Select the controlling variable of the dependent 
source as the circuit variable to which superposition 
will be applied.
	
3.	A component of the controlling variable is obtained 
with each independent source acting alone, while the 
remaining independent sources are set to zero.
	
4.	Apply the superposition equation and substitute 
for the unknown value of the independent source 
its value in terms of the controlling variable in the 
original circuit.
	
5.	The controlling variable is determined from the 
superposition equation.
	
6.	Once the controlling variable is determined, the 
desired circuit response can be found using KCL, 
KVL, and Ohm’s law.
When two dependent variables are present, the pre-
ceding procedure can be applied to the controlling 
variable of each of the dependent sources. The result 
is two superposition equations in the two controlling 
variables as unknowns. Once these variables are deter-
mined from the solution of these equations, the desired 
circuit responses can be found using KCL, KVL, and 
Ohm’s law.
When three or more dependent sources are present, 
the superposition method does not have a decisive 
advantage over alternative methods discussed in pre-
ceding chapters and in Chapter 6.
Example 5.2:   Superposition with Dependent  
Current Source
It is required to determine VO in Figure 5.11a using 
superposition.
Solution:
In accordance with the aforementioned procedure, the 
dependent source is replaced by an independent current 
source IY of unknown value (Figure 5.11b) and superposi-
tion applied to IO in the middle branch. When each inde-
pendent source is ­acting alone, with the other sources set 
to zero, the resulting circuits are as shown in Figure 5.12. 
With the 40 V source applied alone (Figure 5.12a), the cur-
rent through the source is 40/(20 + 10‖10) = 40/25 = 1.6 A. 
By current division, IO1 = 1.6/2 = 0.8 A. With the 20 V 
source applied alone (Figure 5.12b), the current through 
the source is 20/(10 + 20‖10) = 60/50 = 1.2 A. By ­current 
division, IO2 = 1.2 × 20/30 = 0.8 A. With IY applied alone, 
the ­circuit can be redrawn as in Figure 5.12c. By current 
division, using ratios of conductances,

The superposition equation is IO  =  0.8  +  0.8  +  0.4IY. 
Substituting IY = 0.5IO gives IO = 2 A. From the given cir-
cuit, the voltage across the middle 10 Ω resistor is 20 V.

Given that IX = 6 A in Figure 5.14a, it is required to deter-
mine ρ and IY.
Solution:
From KCL at node ‘d’ in Figure 5.14b, IY = 1 A. From 
KVL around the loop ‘bcdab’, 6ρ – 2 × 1 – 6 × 3 + 15 = 0, 
which gives ρ = 5/6.

IY will next be derived as an illustration of super-
position and the substitution theorem. The dependent 
source is replaced by an independent voltage source 
of unknown value VY, and the 3 Ω resistor is replaced 
by a 6 A source in accordance with the substitution 
theorem (Figure 5.15). Superposition can then be 
applied to IY with each of the independent sources act-
ing alone.
When either voltage source is applied alone, the two 
current sources are replaced by open circuits, which 
makes both components of IY, due to the voltage sources, 
equal to zero. When the 6 A source is applied alone, 
with the 5 A source replaced by an open circuit, IY1 = 6 
A. Similarly, when the 5 A source is applied alone, with 
the 6 A source replaced by an open circuit, IY2 = −5 A. 
It ­follows that IY = 1 A, as before.
Simulation: ρ = 5/6 is used in the simulation to verify 
that the current in the 6 Ω resistor is 6 A. The circuit is 
entered as in Figure 5.16. Note that 5/6 is entered as 
a decimal number since PSpice does not accept frac-
tions in data entries. After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under 
‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation Settings and running 
the simulation, pressing the I and V buttons displays 
the currents and voltages, respectively, indicated in 
Figure 5.16.

tion of VSRC1 and VSRC2. VX, the voltage across the 60 Ω,

can be readily derived by superposition. Thus, if VSRC1 
is applied alone, with VSRC2 replaced by a short circuit, 
it follows from voltage division that VX1 = (30‖60)VSRC1/
(40 + 30‖60) = 20VSRC1/(40 + 20) = VSRC1/3. Similarly, if 
VSRC2 is applied alone, with VSRC1 replaced by a short 
circuit, VX2  =  (40‖60)VSRC2/(30  +  20‖60)  =  24VSRC2/
(30 + 24) = VSRC2/2.25. Hence,

The power PX1 dissipated in the 60 Ω resistor due 
to VSRC1 acting alone is (1/60)(VSRC1/3)2, whereas the 
power PX2 dissipated in the 60 Ω resistor due to VSRC2 
acting alone is (1/60)(VSRC2/3)2. The sum of these

It is seen that PX ≠ PX1 + PX2, because the square of 
the sum of VSRC1/3 and VSRC2/2.25 in Equation 5.15 is 
not equal to the sum of the squares of these terms in 
Equation 5.14. Hence, to obtain the correct value of 
power dissipated in a resistor using superposition, the 
voltage across the resistor, or the current through the resistor, 
is first obtained by superposition, and the power can then be 
determined using the total value of the voltage or current.

Tabulate the powers dissipated in each of the resistors 
in Figure 5.19 due to each source applied alone, with

delivered in each case.

response is multiplied by the same factor. This can be 
made use of in some types of circuits by assuming a con-
venient output, working backward from this output to 
the source of excitation, and then scaling the output in 
accordance with the value of the given source.
As an example, consider the circuit of Figure 5.22a, 
where it is required to determine IO. It is rather awk-
ward to do this by any of the conventional methods. But 
it may be assumed quite arbitrarily that IO = 1 A and then 
work backward toward the voltage at the source termi-
nals (Figure 5.22b). The voltage of node ‘a’ with respect 
to the common node ‘d’ is 6 V. The current from node ‘a’ 
to node ‘d’ through the 6 Ω resistor is 1 A. From KCL at 
node ‘a’, the current flowing toward node ‘a’ through the 
1 Ω resistor is 2 A. The voltage of node ‘b’ with respect 
to node ‘d’ is 8 V. Proceeding in this manner gives a volt-
age of 20 V at the source terminals. IO per unit of applied 
excitation is 1/20 A/V, which means that when the exci-
tation is 5 V, then IO = 5/20 = 0.25 A in the original circuit.
The method of output scaling can be applied to cir-
cuits that are more general than the ladder circuit of 
Figure 5.22a, and which may include dependent sources. 
But the circuit must have a single independent source of 
excitation, and must be such that one can assume a cer-
tain output and then work backward toward the input 
by systematically determining all the currents and volt-
ages along the way, without having to invoke additional 
variables. This is illustrated by Example 5.4.
Primal Exercise 5.11
Determine IO in Figure 5.22a if the excitation is a 4 A 
source instead of a 5 V source.
Ans. IO = 0.5 A.
Primal Exercise 5.12
Determine IO in Figure 5.23.
Ans. IO = 0.5 A.
Example 5.4:  Output Scaling
It is required to determine IO in Figure 5.24a using 
­output scaling.
Solution:
We will assume a convenient value for IO, such as 1 A, 
and work backward toward the source terminals using 
KCL, KVL, and Ohm’s law.
Let the nodes be labeled as in Figure 5.24b with 
IO = 1 A and node ‘d’ taken as reference. Vc = 5 V. The 
CCCS is 4 A, so that Icb = 3 A, where Icb is the current in 
the 3 Ω resistor that flows from node ‘c’ toward node ‘b’.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The voltage drop across the 3 Ω resistor is 9 V, so that 
Vb = VX = 5 – 9 = −4 V, Idb = 0.5 A. The voltage of the 
VCVS is −8 V, so it can be taken as +8 V of reversed 
polarity. From KCL at node ‘b’, Iba = 3.5 A. This makes 
Va = −4 + 8 – 2 × 3.5 = −3 V. KCL at node ‘a’ gives a cur-
rent of 0.5 A flowing in the 16 Ω resistor toward node ‘a’. 
The voltage at the input terminal is −3 + 16 × 0.5 = 5 V. 
Since IO per unit source voltage is 1/5 A/V, it follows 
that IO = 4 A for a source voltage of 20 V, and all currents 
and voltages in Figure 5.24b are multiplied by 4.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 5.25. 
After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in 
the Simulation Settings and running the simulation, 
pressing the I and V buttons displays the currents and 
­voltages, respectively, indicated in Figure 5.25.
5.3  Redundant Resistors
5.3.1  Redundant Resistors Connected to Sources
Concept: A resistor in series with an ideal current source is 
redundant as far as the rest of the circuit is concerned, but 
affects the voltage across the source. Similarly, a resistor in 
parallel with an ideal voltage source is redundant as far as the 
rest of the circuit is concerned, but affects the current through 
the source.
Consider a 2 A current source connected in series 
with a 3  Ω resistor to a circuit ‘N’ represented by its 
TEC between terminals ‘ab’ (Figure 5.26a). The current 
source forces 2 A into terminal ‘a’ and out of terminal 
‘b’, producing a voltage Vab = 4 × 2 + 8 = 16 V. Removing 
the 3 Ω resistor does not affect the current supplied to 
circuit ‘N’, and hence does not affect Vab (Figure 5.26b). 
The 3 Ω resistor is therefore redundant as far the rest of 
the circuit is concerned, which in this case is circuit ‘N’. 
So what is the effect of the 3 Ω resistor? Its effect is on 
the voltage across the current source, which is 16 V in 
the absence of the 3 Ω resistor, and 22 V in its presence, 
due to the 6 V drop across the resistor. Being an ideal 
current source, the source current is not affected by the 
voltage across it.
Figure 5.27a shows an ideal voltage source of 12 V con-
nected in parallel with a 3 Ω resistor across terminals ‘ab’ 
of the same circuit ‘N’ that is now represented by its NEC 
between these terminals. The source impresses 12 V across 
the terminals, so that the current in RN is 3 A and the input 
current at terminal ‘a’ is 1 A. Removing the 3 Ω resistor 
(Figure 5.27b) does not affect the voltage across terminals 
‘ab’ and hence the input current to circuit ‘N’. The 3 Ω resis-
tor is therefore redundant as far as circuit ‘N’ is concerned. 
The effect of the 3 Ω resistor is on the current in the ideal 
voltage source. This ­current is 1 A without the 3 Ω resistor, 
and 5 A in its presence, because of the 4 A that it draws 
from the source. Being an ideal voltage source, the source 
voltage is not affected by the current through the source.

Example 5.5:  Redundant Resistors 
Connected to Sources
It is required to determine TEC at terminals ‘ab’ in 
Figure 5.28a.
Solution:
The 8 Ω resistor in parallel with the 5 V source and the 
3 Ω resistor in series with the VCCS are both redundant 
as far as deriving TEC at terminals ‘ab’ is concerned and 
can be removed from the circuit.
Another simplification that can be made is to tem-
porarily remove the 6 and 2.6 Ω resistors, derive an 
intermediate TEC that does not include these resis-
tors, and then add the resistors to this intermediate 
TEC and determine the required TEC, as was done 
in Example 4.4. Accordingly, TEC is first determined 
at terminals ‘cd’ in Figure 5.28b, without including 
the 6 and 2.6 Ω resistors. VTh1 across these terminals 
is also the controlling voltage for the VCCS. From 
KVL, VTh1 = 2 × 0.25VTh1 + 5, which gives VTh1 = 10 V. 
If terminals ‘ab’ are short-­circuited (Figure 5.28c), 
VTh1 becomes zero and the VCCS is replaced by an 
open  ­circuit. Hence, ISC  =  5/2  =  2.5 A, and RTh1  = 
10/2.5 = 4 Ω.
The second step is to connect the 6 and 2.6 Ω resistors 
to VTh1 and RTh1 (Figure 5.29a) and derive TEC between 
terminals ‘ab’. With these terminals open-circuited, VTh 
is the same as the voltage across the 6 Ω resistor, which 
by voltage division is 10 × 6/(4 + 6) = 6 V. With the 10 V 
source set to zero, the resistance looking into terminals 
‘ab’ is 2.6 + 4‖6 = 2.6 + (4 × 6)/(4 + 6) = 5 Ω. TEC is as 
shown in Figure 5.29b.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 5.30, with 
the test current source applied at terminals ‘ab’ in the 
given circuit so as to determine TEC. Note that in order 
to apply the controlling voltage VX in the required polar-
ity, the positive terminal of the controlling voltage input 
should be connected to the upper line and the negative 
terminal to ground. But this involves awkward-looking 
cross connections, which can be avoided by reversing 
the connections of the controlling voltage, as shown, and 
changing the sign of the gain of the dependent source to 
−0.25. DC Sweep is used as explained in Example 4.1, 
the resulting graph being shown in Figure 5.31. It is seen 
that VTh = 6 V and RTh = 5 Ω.

5.3.2  Resistors Not Carrying Current
In Figure 5.33, the resistances are such that nodes ‘b’

The currents and voltages in the circuit are indicated 
in Figure 5.34. It is seen that none of these depends on 
any resistance R that may be connected between nodes 
‘b’ and ‘d’. This is because R does not carry any current, 
since its terminals are at the same voltage, so there is 
no voltage drop across it. It follows that R can have 
any value, without affecting the rest of the circuit. This 
includes extreme values of R, that is, an open circuit, as 
in Figure 5.33, or a short circuit, when nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’ 
are directly connected together.
The conditions depicted in Figures 5.33 and 5.34 lead 
to the following conclusions:
	
1.	Resistor R in Figure 5.34, not carrying any cur-
rent, is redundant. It can have any value, can be 
removed from the circuit, or can be replaced by 
a short circuit, without affecting the rest of the 
circuit.
	
2.	Nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’ in Figure 5.33, being at the 
same voltage, can be connected together, with-
out affecting the rest of the circuit, and no 
­current flows in the connection.
It may be noted that the condition in Figure 5.33, 
when nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’ are at the same voltage is 
referred to as bridge balance, and the bridge is said 
to be balanced under these conditions. The resistive 
bridge circuit is of considerable practical importance 
and is known as a Wheatstone bridge. It is discussed 
in Appendix 5A.
The preceding conclusions can be generalized to the 
following concepts:
Concepts:
	
1.	A reduntant resistor can be removed from the 
­circuit,  without disturbing the rest of the circuit. 
When removing a redundant resistor the following 
applies:
	
(i)	 A series resistor is replaced by a short circuit, 
as in the case of a resistor in series with an ideal 
current source.
	
(ii)	 A parallel resistor is replaced by an open cir-
cuit, as in the case of a resistor in parallel with 
an ideal voltage source.

(iii)	 In cases where the redundant resistor does not 
carry current, as in the case of bridge balance, 
the resistor may be replaced by a short circuit or 
an open circuit, as can be readily checked.
	
2.	Nodes that are at the same voltage, without being short-
circuited together, can be left open-circuited or can be 
connected by a short circuit or by resistors of arbitrary 
values, without any current flowing in the connections 
and without affecting the rest of the circuit.
	
3.	If several circuit elements are connected to nodes at 
the same voltage, the circuit elements can be recon-
nected between the nodes in any arbitrary manner 
without affecting the rest of the circuit, as long as the 
reconnection does not change the node voltages (see 
Problem P5.58).
It should be emphasized that when two nodes are 
referred to as being at the same voltage, as in item ‘2’ of 
the preceding concepts, these nodes are not connected 
together by a short circuit, which evidently makes them 
at the same voltage. If the short circuit is replaced by 
an open circuit, the two nodes will not in general be 
at the same voltage. A resistor connected between the 
nodes will therefore carry current and is not redundant. 
Consider, for example, the bridge circuit of Figure 5.35, 
where the output nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’ are short-circuited and 
are therefore at the same voltage with respect to node ‘d’. 
However, if this short circuit is replaced by an open cir-
cuit, Vcd = 12 × 24/30 = 9.6 V, and Vbd = 12 × 8/20 = 4.8 V, 
so that a voltage difference exists between these nodes. If 
a resistor is connected between nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’, the resis-
tor carries current and cannot be considered redundant. 
Note that current flows in the short circuit in Figure 5.35.
Primal Exercise 5.15
Determine the resistance seen by the 12 V source in 
Figure 5.33 and verify that it remains the same when 
nodes ‘b’ and ‘c’ are short-circuited.
Ans. 9.6 Ω.
5.4  Partitioning of Circuits by Ideal Sources
Concept: If an ideal voltage source is connected in parallel with 
two circuits or an ideal current source is connected in series 
with two circuits, the two circuits can be separated, one from 
the other, as long as the two circuits are independent of one 
another, that is, they are not interconnected in any other way.
Consider Figure 5.36a in which an ideal 12 V source 
is connected in parallel between two circuits ‘N1’ and 
‘N2’, each represented by its TEC between terminals ‘a1’ 
and ‘b1’ of ‘N1’ and ‘a2’ and ‘b2’ of ‘N2’. According to the 
­foregoing concept, the ideal voltage source effectively 
separates the two circuits, one from the other, so that 
changes in one circuit do not affect the other circuit.
To verify this, note that KVL around the mesh con-
sisting of ‘N1’ and the 12 V source gives 16 = 4I1 + 12, 
where I1 is the current flowing out of the terminal ‘a1’. 
This makes I1 = 1 A, as shown. KVL around the mesh 
consisting of ‘N2’ and the 12 V source gives 12 = 2I2 + 8, 
where I2 is the current entering terminal ‘a2’. This 
makes I2  =  2  A, as shown. Suppose, for the sake of 
argument, that ‘N1’ is altered so that its VTh is 18 V and 
its RTh is 5 Ω (Figure 5.36b). KVL around the mesh on

the left gives 18 = 5I1 + 12, which makes I1 = 1.2 A. KVL 
around the mesh on the right is unchanged, so that I2 
remains the same. With the voltage between terminals 
‘a2’ and ‘b2’ remaining at 12 V, conditions in ‘N2’ remain 
the same, despite changes in ‘N1’. The current in the 
12 V source is reduced from 1 to 0.8 A, but because 
the source is assumed to be ideal, its voltage does not 
change, even if the current through it is reversed. The 
same argument applies if ‘N2’ is changed, for example, 
so that its VTh is 6 V and its RTh is 4 Ω (Figure 5.36c). KVL 
around the mesh on the right gives 12 = 4I2 + 6, which 
makes I2 = 1.5 A. KVL around the mesh on the left is 
unchanged, so that I1 remains the same. With the volt-
age between terminals ‘a1’ and ‘b1’ remaining at 12 V, 
conditions in ‘N1’ remain the same, despite changes 
in ‘N2’. The current in the 12 V source is reduced from 1 
to 0.5 A, but because the source is assumed to be ideal, 
its voltage does not change. ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ are therefore 
effectively separated by the ­voltage source, so that each 
circuit can be considered independently of the other.
As a straightforward application of partitioning of a 
circuit by a voltage source, suppose that VO is required 
in the circuit of Figure 5.37a. At first glance, this looks 
like a complex circuit, but a closer inspection reveals 
that the 8 V is connected in parallel between the left part 
of the circuit and the right part. The circuit is therefore 
partitioned into two separate circuits. The circuit on 
the right is shown in Figure 5.37b, after removal of the 
10 Ω resistor connected in parallel with the 8 V source, 
because this resistor is redundant as far as VO is con-
cerned. From voltage division, VO =
+
´
=
6
6
2
8
6 V.
An analogous argument can be made for an ideal 
current source connected in series with two circuits. 
Consider Figure 5.38a in which an ideal 1 A source is 
connected in series with two circuits ‘N1’ and ‘N2’, each 
represented by its NEC between terminals ‘a1’ and 
‘b1’ of ‘N1’ and ‘a2’ and ‘b2’ of ‘N2’. According to the 
foregoing concept, the ideal current source effectively 
separates the two circuits, one from the other, so that 
changes in one circuit do not affect the other circuit.
To verify this, note that from KCL at node ‘a1’, the cur-
rent flowing downward in the 4 Ω resistor of ‘N1’ is 3 A, 
and by Ohm’s law the voltage across the terminals of 
‘N1’ is V1 = 12 V. Similarly, the current flowing down-
ward in the 2 Ω resistor of ‘N2’ is 3 A, and by Ohm’s law 
the voltage across the terminals of ‘N2’ is V2 = 6 V. From 
KVL, the voltage across the 1 A source is V1 – V2 = 6 V, of 
the polarity shown.
Suppose, for example, that ‘N1’ is altered so that its IN is 
5 A and its RN is 2 Ω (Figure 5.38b). From KCL at node ‘a1’, 
a current of 4 A flows downward through the 2 Ω resis-
tor, so that V1 = 8 V. The source current entering node ‘a2’ 
is 1 A, the current flowing in the 2 Ω resistor of ‘N2’ is 3 
A, and V2 = 6 V. With the terminal current and voltage at 
‘a2b2’ remaining the same, the conditions in ‘N2’ remain 
the same, despite changes in ‘N1’. The voltage across the 
1 A source decreases from 6 to 4 V, but because the source 
is assumed to be ideal, its current does not change.

A similar argument applies if ‘N2’ is altered, as in 
Figure 5.38c. The terminal voltage and current of ‘N1’ 
remain the same, but the voltage Va1a2 across the current 
source changes. ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ are therefore effectively 
separated by the current source, so that each circuit can 
be considered independently of the other.
As an example of the partitioning of a circuit by a cur-
rent source, consider the circuit of Figure 5.39a, where 
it is required to determine VO. The 2 A series-connected 
source partitions the circuit into two separate circuits. 
The circuit on the right is shown in Figure 5.39b, after 
removal of the 7 Ω resistor connected in series with the 
2 A source, because this resistor is redundant as far as VO 
is concerned. The current source is reconnected across 
the 8 Ω resistor, which does not alter KCL at nodes ‘a’ 
and ‘b’. From current division, the current in the 6 Ω 
resistor is 2 × 8/(8 + 8) = 1 A, which gives VO = 6 V.
Before ending this section, it should be emphasized 
that the two separate circuits that resulted from par-
titioning the circuits of Figures 5.36a and 5.38a are 
independent, that is, they are not interconnected in 
any other way. Otherwise, each circuit could not be 
considered separately. The two circuits could be inter-
connected, for example, by one or more elements 
that bridge them or by having a dependent source in 
one circuit controlled by a voltage or a current in the 
other circuit.
Primal Exercise 5.16
(a) Replace the single 12 V source in Figure 5.36a by two 
12 V sources, one connected to circuit ‘N1’ between ­terminals 
‘a1’ and ‘b1’, the other to circuit ‘N2’ between terminals ‘a2’ 
and ‘b2’, the ‘a’ terminals being positive with respect to 
the ‘b’ terminals. Does this affect circuits ‘N1’ and ‘N2’? 
Compare the net power delivered by the two sources 
with that delivered by the single source in Figure 5.36a. 
(b) Replace the 1 A current source in Figure 5.38a by two 
1 A current sources, one directed from terminal ‘a1’ to ter-
minal ‘b1’, the other directed from terminal ‘b2’ to terminal 
‘a2’. Does this affect circuits ‘N1’ and ‘N2’? Compare the net 
power absorbed by the two sources with that absorbed by 
the single source in Figure 5.38a.

absorbed in both cases.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Suppose that IX in Figure 5.41a is required. IX in this 
simple case can be obtained from current division as 
5 × 6/15 = 2 A. A more general procedure is to replace 
the 5 A source by two sources, as in Figure 5.41b. KCL at 
nodes ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ remains the same. Thus, at nodes ‘a’ 
and ‘b’: 5 – IX + IX = 5, and at node ‘c’, the two 5 A sources 
cancel out. From KVL around the mesh of three resistors, 
2(5 – IX) – 9IX + 4(5 – IX) = 0, which gives IX = 2 A.
Example 5.6:  Source Rearrangement
It is required to determine IX in Figure 5.42 using source 
rearrangement.
Solution:
The 10 A source is split into two sources as in Figure 5.43. 
In Figure 5.42, a current of 10 A enters node ‘b’ from the 
source and a current of 10 A leaves node ‘a’ from the 
source. The same conditions are preserved in Figure 5.43. 
A source current of 10 A both enters and leaves node ‘c’ 
in Figure 5.43, so that the net source current at this node 
is zero, as in Figure 5.42.
The 10 V source can also be split into two 10 V sources 
in parallel, as in Figure 5.44a. The upper terminals of the 
two 10 V sources are evidently at the same voltage with 
respect to the lower node, so that no current flows in this 
connection (Section 5.3). The connection can therefore be 
removed, as in Figure 5.44b, without disturbing the rest 
of the circuit, which is now split into two subcircuits. IX 
can be readily determined by deriving TEC seen by the 
6 Ω resistor (Figure 5.45).
Superposition can be applied with the voltage 
sources acting alone and with the current sources act-
ing alone. When the two 10 A sources are set to zero, 
Vac = 10 × 2/5 = 4 V, and Vbc = 10 × 4/10 = 4 V. Hence, 
nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’ are at the same voltage, so that this com-
ponent of Vba is zero. If the 10 V sources are set to zero,

Vac = −10 × 6/5 = −12 V, and Vbc = 10 × 24/10 = 24 V. 
It follows that Vba  =  VTh  =  36 V. With all sources set 
to zero, RTh  =  (4‖6)  +  (2‖3)  =  3.6 Ω. TEC is therefore 
a source of  36  V in series with 3.6 Ω. When the 6 Ω 
resistor is reconnected (Figure  5.46), it is seen that 
IX = 36/9.6 = 3.75 A.

★5.6  Exploitation of Symmetry
Symmetry in a circuit can generally be exploited to 
greatly simplify the analysis required for obtaining a 
given response. Consider, for example, Figure 5.48, in 
which it is desired to determine I. The circuit is sym-
metrical about a vertical line XX′ through its midline. 
This feature can be made use of in one of two ways to 
determine I.
The first method is based on the observation that 
because of symmetry, nodes ‘b’ and ‘d’ are at the same 
voltage with respect to node ‘c’. They can therefore be 
connected together without disturbing the circuit, as 
explained in Section 5.3. In effect, this is equivalent to 
folding the circuit about the midline XX′. The 4 Ω resis-
tor along XX′ is not affected, but each of the other resis-
tors is paralleled with a resistor of equal value, which 
halves the resistance in each case, as illustrated in Figure 
5.49a. The three upper resistances are equivalent to 2 Ω 
in parallel with a combination of 2 Ω in series with 4 Ω, 
which is 1.5 Ω. This resistance is in series with 0.5 Ω 
across the voltage source, so that I = 6/2 = 3 A.
In the second method, the circuit is split along the mid-
line into two symmetrical halves. The 4 Ω resistor, being 
common to the two halves, is replaced by two 8 Ω resistors,

which when paralleled give 4 Ω. The 6 V source is rear-
ranged into two parallel sources of 6 V each, the current 
through each source being I/2. The left half of the circuit is 
illustrated in Figure 5.42b. As in Figure 5.49a, the resistance 
across the voltage source is then 1 + 4‖(4 + 8) = 1 + 3 = 4 Ω, 
and I/2 = 6/4 = 1.5 A, or I = 3 A, as before.
Primal Exercise 5.20
Suppose that the 6 V source in Figure 5.48 is replaced by 
a 3 A current source. Determine the voltage across the 
source, using the two methods described in connection 
with Figure 5.49.
Ans. 6 V.
Example 5.7:  Exploitation of Symmetry
It is required to determine the equivalent resistance 
between nodes ‘ab’ in Figure 5.50.
Solution:
To determine the resistance between nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’, a test 
source is applied between these nodes and the resulting test 
current or voltage determined, as in Figure 5.51. It may be 
suspected that the voltages at nodes ‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’ are half-
way between the voltage of nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’, so that nodes 
‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’ are at the same voltage. But how can this be 
verified in an easy manner? The answer is to apply a very 
useful problem-solving technique, namely, make a reasonable 
assumption, and then check if this assumption leads to logically 
consistent results; if it does, then the assumption is justified. In 
this case, let us assume that nodes ‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’ in Figure 
5.51 are at the same voltage, which means that the 0.5 Ω 
resistors between these nodes are redundant, since they 
do not carry current, and can be removed without affect-
ing the rest of the circuit. When these resistors are removed, 
the circuit becomes as in Figure 5.51. It follows from voltage 
division between nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’ that nodes ‘c’, ‘d’, and 
‘e’ are at the same voltage with respect to node ‘b’, which 
means that any resistance, not only 0.5 Ω, can be connected 
between these nodes without affecting the rest of the circuit. 
Moreover, the 0.5 Ω resistors could equally well be replaced 
by open circuits or short circuits. Hence, the initial assump-
tion that nodes ‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’ are at the same voltage leads 
to a logically consistent conclusion, in that these nodes are 
indeed at the same voltage, so that the initial assumption 
is justified. Had the removal of the 0.5 Ω resistors led to 
unequal voltages of nodes ‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’, then this result is 
inconsistent with the assumption of equality of voltages at 
the nodes, which would invalidate the assumption.
It is seen from Figure 5.51 that VT/IT is three resis-
tances in parallel: 2 Ω in parallel with 2 Ω gives 1 Ω. This, 
in parallel with 1 Ω, is 0.5 Ω.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 5.52. A 1 A 
current source is used to indicate the resistance between 
nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’ as being numerically equal to the 
voltage of node ‘a’ with respect to ground at node ‘b’. 
After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in the 
Simulation Settings and running the simulation, press-
ing the I and V buttons displays the currents and volt-
ages, respectively, indicated in Figure 5.52.

Problem-Solving Tips
•	 Always bear in mind that determining an equivalent 
resistance between two nodes is based on applying 
a test source and determining the resulting current 
or voltage. In the absence of dependent sources, the 
equivalent resistance can be found directly, as from 
series–parallel combinations of resistances.
•	 A useful problem-solving technique is to make 
a reasonable assumption and then check if this 
assumption leads to logically consistent results; if 
it does, then the assumption is justified.
Primal Exercise 5.21
Verify that short-circuiting nodes ‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’ in 
Figure 5.51 give Rab = 0.5 Ω.
It should be noted that exploitation of symmetry in 
the preceding examples basically depends on ­having 
nodes of the same voltage about an axis of symmetry 
rather than having equal resistances about this axis. In 
Figure 5.53, for example, the resistance values have been 
changed compared to Figure 5.50. Applying the same 
argument as in Example 5.7 leads to the conclusion that 
if a test source is applied between nodes ‘a’ and ‘b’, the 
0.5 Ω and 6 Ω resistors do not carry current and can be 
removed from the circuit. The resistance between nodes 
‘a’ and ‘b’ is then 3∙6∙12 = 12/7 Ω.
5.7  Problem-Solving Approach Updated
The main procedural steps of the ISDEPIC approach are 
summarized and updated as follows in the light of the 
material covered in this chapter:
Step 1—Initialize:
	 (a)	 Mark on the circuit diagram all given values of 
circuit parameters, currents, and voltages, as 
well as the unknowns to be determined.
	 (b)	 Label the nodes, as this may be generally helpful.
	 (c)	 If the solution requires that a given value of cur-
rent or voltage be satisfied, assume this value 
from the very beginning
Step 2—Simplify: Consider, as may be appropriate,
	 (a)	 Redrawing the circuit
	 (b)	 Replacing series and parallel combinations of 
circuit elements by an equivalent circuit element
	 (c)	 Applying star-delta transformation
	 (d)	 Applying source transformation
	 (e)	 Using TEC or NEC to simplify part of the circuit
	 (f)	 Applying the source absorption theorem
	 (g)	 Removing resistors that are redundant as far as 
the variables of interest are concerned
	 (h)	 Partitioning the circuit in the presence of shunt-
connected ideal voltage sources or series-­
connected ideal current sources
	 (i)	 Exploiting symmetry
Step 3—Deduce: Determine any values of current or volt-
age that follow immediately from direct application of 
Ohm’s law, KCL, or KVL, without introducing any addi-
tional unknowns. If Step 3 does not provide a solution, 
proceed to Step 4.
Step 4—Explore: Examine each of the following alterna-
tives, as may be applicable:
	 (a)	 Consider the nodes and meshes in the circuit 
to see if KCL or KVL can be expressed using a 
single unknown current or voltage, and if this 
unknown can then be directly determined from 
KCL or KVL.
	 (b)	 Use TEC or NEC to determine a voltage or a 
current through a given circuit element.
	 (c)	 Apply the substitution theorem.
	 (d)	 Apply superposition if more than one source is 
present in the circuit.
	 (e)	 Use output scaling.
	 (f)	 Rearrange sources.
If Step 4 does not provide the solution, proceed to 
Step 5.
Step 5—Plan: Think carefully and creatively about the 
problem in the light of circuit fundamentals and circuit 
analysis techniques. Consider alternative solutions and 
select what seems to be the simplest and most direct 
solution.
Step 6—Implement: Carry out your planned solution.

Step 7—Check your calculations and results.
	 (a)	 Check that your results make sense, in terms of 
magnitude and sign.
	 (b)	 Check that Ohm’s law is satisfied across every 
resistor, that KCL is satisfied at every node, and 
that KVL is satisfied around every mesh.
	 (c)	 Seek an alternative solution to see if it gives the 
same result.
	 (d)	 Whenever feasible, check simulate with PSpice.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 If an input x1 to a given system produces an out-
put y1 and an input x2 produces an output y2, 
then the system obeys superposition if an input 
(x1 + x2) that is the sum of the two inputs pro-
duces an output (y1 + y2) that is the sum of the 
outputs due to each input acting alone. The same 
applies for more than two inputs.
•	 The procedure for applying superposition 
in the absence of dependent sources can be 
­summarized as follows:
	
1.	 Select the desired voltage or current 
response as the circuit variable to which 
superposition will be applied.
	
2.	 A component of the desired response is 
obtained with each independent source act-
ing alone, while the remaining independent 
sources are set to zero.
	
3.	 The desired response is the algebraic sum of 
the individual components.
•	 In the presence of a single dependent source, 
the dependent source can be left in place and 
superposition applied to the desired response 
by applying the independent sources one at a 
time, or the following procedure adopted:
	
1.	 Replace the dependent source with an 
­independent source of unknown value.
	
2.	 Select the controlling variable of the depen-
dent source as the circuit variable to which 
superposition will be applied.
	
3.	 A component of the controlling variable is 
obtained with each independent source act-
ing alone, while the remaining independent 
sources are set to zero.
	
4.	 Apply the superposition equation and sub-
stitute for the unknown value of the inde-
pendent source its value in terms of the 
controlling variable in the original circuit.
	
5.	 The controlling variable is determined from 
the superposition equation.
	
6.	 Once the controlling variable is determined, 
the desired circuit response can be found 
using KCL and KVL.
•	 Because power is a nonlinear function of volt-
age or current, superposition cannot be applied 
directly to power. The voltage across the resis-
tor, or the current through the resistor, is first 
obtained by superposition, and the power can 
then be determined using the total value of the 
voltage or current.
•	 In some circuits, such as those excited by a sin-
gle independent source, a convenient output 
can be assumed, and the voltages and currents 
determined by working backward from the out-
put to the source, using KCL, KVL, and Ohm’s 
law. The output is then scaled in accordance 
with the value of the source.
	
1.	 Scaling can be applied to more general circuits 
as long as it is possible to assume a certain 
output and then work backward toward the 
input by systematically determining all the 
currents and voltages along the way, without 
having to invoke additional variables.
•	 A resistor in series with an ideal current source 
is redundant as far as the rest of the circuit is 
concerned, but affects the voltage across the 
source. Similarly, a resistor in parallel with an 
ideal voltage source is redundant as far as the 
rest of the circuit is concerned, but affects the 
current through the source.
•	 A redundant resistor can be removed from the 
circuit, without disturbing the rest of the cir-
cuit. When removing a redundant resistor, a 
redundant series resistor is replaced by a short 
circuit, whereas a redundant parallel resistor is 
replaced by an open circuit. A redundant resis-
tor that does not carry current may be replaced 
by a short circuit or an open circuit.
•	 Nodes that are at the same voltage, without 
being short-circuited together, can be left open-
circuited or can be connected by a short circuit 
or by resistors of arbitrary values, without any 
current flowing in the connection and without 
affecting the rest of the circuit.
•	 If an ideal voltage source is connected in paral-
lel with two circuits or an ideal current source 
is connected in series with two circuits, the two 
circuits can be separated, one from the other, as 
long as the two circuits are independent of one 
another, that is, they are not interconnected in 
any other way.

Circuit Simplification	
135
•	 A circuit can be simplified by replacing a cur-
rent source by two current sources, without 
changing KCL at the nodes involved. A circuit 
can be simplified by replacing a voltage source 
by two voltage source, without changing KVL 
around the meshes involved.
•	 Symmetry in a circuit can generally be exploited 
to greatly simplify the analysis required for 
obtaining a given response.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	The substitution theorem can be used to replace 
a branch current or voltage by an independent 
source, which allows application of superposition.
	
2.	Superposition can be advantageously applied 
in conjunction with the substitution theorem by 
replacing dependent sources, or branch ­currents 
or voltages, by independent sources.
	
3.	A circuit should always be carefully inspected 
to see if it can be simplified through removal 
of redundant resistors, partitioning of circuits 
because of parallel location of an ideal voltage 
source, or series location of an ideal current 
source, or through source rearrangement, or 
exploitation of symmetry.
	
4.	Always bear in mind that determining an equiv-
alent resistance between two nodes is based on 
applying a test source and determining the result-
ing current or voltage. In the absence of depen-
dent sources, the equivalent resistance can be 
found directly from series–parallel ­combinations 
of resistances, star-delta transformation, etc..
	
5.	A useful problem-solving technique is to make 
a reasonable assumption, and then check if this 
assumption leads to logically consistent results; 
if it does, then the assumption is justified.
Appendix 5A: Wheatstone Bridge
Bridge circuits are commonly used for accurate measure-
ments of circuit parameters. The basic principle is illus-
trated by the Wheatstone bridge for dc measurement 
of resistance (Figure 5.54). When the bridge is ­balanced, 
Vbc = Vdc, so that VO = 0, and the detector ‘D’ does not

The balance condition can be stated as (1) the prod-
uct of resistances in diametrically opposite arms of the 
bridge is the same or (2) the ratio of resistances in adja-
cent, opposite arms of the bridge is the same.
For the accurate measurement of an unknown resis-
tance say R3, R2 is an accurately known fixed, refer-
ence resistor, and R1 and R4 are high-quality resistors 
of the same type whose resistances can be varied in 
small enough steps. R1 and R4 are varied until bridge 
balance is achieved. R3 is then determined from 
Equation 5.20. Two factors underlie the accuracy of 
this measurement:
	
1.	A zero indication can be much more accurately 
determined than a nonzero value of current or 
voltage, because the scale around zero can be 
expanded to almost any desired degree of accu-
racy. A sensitive, current-measuring device, 
known as a galvanometer is normally used to 
indicate bridge balance. A method of measure-
ment based on an indication of zero is referred 
to as a null method.
	
2.	The ratio of resistances of two resistors of the 
same type, such as R1 and R4, is much more 
accurate than the absolute value of either one, 
because systematic, that is, nonrandom, errors 
in R1 and R4 tend to cancel out.

Objective and Overview
This chapter presents the systematic methods for analyz-
ing circuits, namely, the node-voltage and mesh-­current 
methods and discusses some of their variants.
Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law provide the number 
of equations necessary to analyze an electric circuit, but 
the number of equations can become unwieldy except 
in simple circuit configurations. Although the theorems, 
procedures, and techniques discussed in Chapters 3 
through 5 can be invaluable in simplifying the analysis 
in many cases, there remains cases where these meth-
ods are not practicable. Systematic methods based on 
Kirchhoff’s laws have therefore been developed to facil-
itate analysis of more complex circuits and reduce the 
likelihood of error in writing the equations that govern 
the behavior of electric circuits. The commonly used 
node-voltage and mesh-current methods are presented 
in this chapter, including some special considerations 
and generalizations.
6.1  Node-Voltage Method
Concept: In the node-voltage method, voltages of essential 
nodes are assigned with respect to one of the essential nodes 
taken as a reference. This automatically satisfies Kirchhoff’s 
voltage law (KVL) in every mesh in the circuit. Equations 
based on Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) are then written 
directly in terms of Ohm’s law for each essential node other 
than the reference node.
The node-voltage method is illustrated by the circuit 
in Figure 6.1a, which is excited by a current source and in 
which resistance values are expressed as conductances. 
The first step is to select one of the essential nodes as the 
reference node. This can be done quite arbitrarily, but it 
is usually convenient to select as reference the node that 
has the largest number of connections, which is usually 
a grounded node. Alternatively, the reference node may 
be selected as a node with respect to which a voltage is 
required so that only one unknown needs to be deter-
mined. If the node voltages are required with respect to 
a node other than the selected reference node, these can 
be derived very simply, as will be shown later. Node ‘d’ 
is chosen as the reference in Figure 6.1a, as indicated by 
the unfilled arrow.
The reference node is assigned a voltage of zero, and 
the voltages of all the other essential nodes are expressed 
with reference to this node. To verify that KVL is satisfied 
around every mesh, consider the upper mesh as an exam-
ple. The voltage drops around this mesh are denoted as 
Vab, Vbc, and Vca in Figure 6.1a. KVL around this mesh is
	
V

= 0	
(6.1)
The voltage drops Vab, Vbc, and Vca can be expressed 
in terms of the assigned node voltages as Vab = Va – Vb, 
Vbc = Vb − Vc, and Vca = Vc − Va. The LHS of Equation 6.1

The node voltages cancel out in pairs, so they sum to 
zero, as required by KVL. The same is true of the other 
meshes in the circuit (Exercise 6.1).
With KVL satisfied, KCL is written for each of the 
essential nodes in terms of Ohm’s law and any source

currents entering or leaving the node. For node ‘a’, the 
total current leaving the node through the conductances 
connected to the node is Iad + Iac + Iab (Figure 6.1b), where 
Iad = GsrcVa, Iac = G5(Va − Vc), and Iab = G1(Va − Vb). The 
source current entering node ‘a’ is ISRC. Equating the cur-
rent leaving the node through the conductances to the 
current entering the node from the source and collecting 
terms in the node voltages gives KCL for node ‘a’ as

Comparing Equations 6.2 through 6.4 reveals a pat-
tern that allows writing the node-voltage equations by 
inspection:
	
1.	In the equation for a given node, the coef-
ficient multiplying the voltage of this node 
is the sum of all the conductances connected 
directly to that node. Thus, in the equation 
for node ‘a’ (Equation 6.2), Va is multiplied by 
(Gsrc + G1 + G5), the sum of the three conduc-
tances connected directly to node ‘a’. Similarly, 
in the equation for node ‘b’ (Equation 6.3), Vb 
is multiplied by (G1 + G2 + G3), and in the equa-
tion for node ‘c’ (Equation 6.4), Vc is multiplied 
by (G3 + G4 + G5).These coefficients are known 
as the self-conductances of the nodes.
	
2.	In the equation for a given node, the coefficient 
multiplying the voltage of each of the other 
nodes is the conductance that directly con-
nects this node to the given node, with a minus 
sign. The minus sign arises from subtracting 
the voltages of the other nodes from the volt-
age of the given node. Thus, the current leaving 
node ‘a’ through G1 is (Va − Vb)G1 = G1Va − G1Vb, 
where G1 directly connects node ‘a’ to node ‘b’. 
In the equation for node ‘a’ (Equation 6.2), Vb is 
therefore multiplied by −G1. The current leaving 
node ‘a’ through G5 is (Va − Vc)G5 = G5Va − G5Vc, 
where G5 connects node ‘a’ to node ‘c’. In the 
equation for node ‘a’ (Equation 6.2) Vc is there-
fore multiplied by −G5. The same is true of the 
other node equations. These coefficients are 
known as the mutual conductances between 
the nodes. If there is no conductance that 
directly connects a certain node with the node 
in ­question, the corresponding mutual conduc-
tance is zero.
If the coefficients of the node voltages in Equations 6.2 
through 6.4 are arranged in an array, as in Figure 6.2, 
the array has the following characteristic features that 
provide a useful check on the correctness of the node-
voltage equations:
	
1.	The self-conductances are the diagonal entries 
in the array from top left to bottom right.
	
2.	The array is symmetrical with respect to this diag-
onal, as illustrated by the coefficients pointed to 
by the double-sided arrows in Figure 6.2. This 
symmetry is because the conductance is inde-
pendent of the direction of current. For example, 
in the expression Iab = G1(Va − Vb), G1 is the same 
as in the expression Iba = G1(Vb − Va), although 
Iab = −Iba. It will be shown in the next section that 
this symmetry is destroyed when the depen-
dency relations of dependent sources are taken 
into account.
	
3.	All the mutual conductances have a negative 
sign, as explained previously.
	
4.	In any row or column, the mutual conductances 
are part of the self-conductance in that row or 
column. Thus, in the first row or first column in 
the array of Example 6.2, G1 and G5 are included 
in the self-conductance term (Gsrc  +  G1  +  G5). 
The remaining conductance is that between the 
given node and the reference node.

follows:
	
1.	The voltage of node ‘n’ is multiplied by the sum of 
all the conductances connected directly to this node, 
which means that node ‘n’ constitutes one terminal 
for each of these conductances, whereas other nodes 
constitute the other terminals.
	
2.	The voltage of every other node is multiplied by the 
conductance connected directly between this node 
and node ‘n’, with a negative sign. A conductance 
is directly connected between two nodes, if each node 
is a terminal for the conductance. If there is no such 
conductance, the coefficient is zero.
	
3.	The LHS of the node-voltage equation for node ‘n’ 
is the sum of the terms from the preceding steps, 
ordered as the unknown node voltages. This sum is 
the total current leaving node ‘n’ through the con-
ductances connected to this node.
	
4.	The RHS of the equation is equal to the algebraic 
sum of source currents entering node ‘n’. Thus, a 
source current entering node ‘n’ will have a positive 
sign, whereas a source current leaving node ‘n’ will 
have a negative sign.
It must be remembered that in the node-voltage 
­equations, KCL at any essential node, other than 
the ­reference node, is satisfied by having the LHS and 
the RHS in the following form:
Sum of currents leaving a node through conductances con-
necting this node to other nodes = Algebraic sum of currents 
entering the node from sources connected to the node
Note that a conductance connected to a node and is in 
series with an ideal, dependent or independent current 
source is redundant as far as the rest of the circuit is con-
cerned. It does not affect the current entering or leaving 
the node, so it does not appear in the node-voltage equa-
tions (see Problems 5.28 and 5.29).
Example 6.1:  Node-Voltage Method
It is required to analyze the circuit of Figure 6.3 using 
the node-voltage method.

Equations 6.8 through 6.10 can be solved by any of the 
usual methods for solving linear simultaneous equations 
or by using appropriate calculators to give: Va  =  9  V, 
Vb = 6 V, and Vc = 4 V. The determinant method for solv-
ing simultaneous equations is explained in Appendix E.
Linear simultaneous equations can be conveniently 
solved using MATLAB. To do so, the conductance coef-
ficients on the LHS of the node-voltage equations are 
entered as a square matrix, and the source currents on 
the RHS of the node-voltage equations are entered as a 
column matrix. In the example under consideration, the 
matrix of coefficients is entered in MATLAB as follows:

the Simulation Settings and running the simulation,

Example 6.2:  Node-Voltage Method 
with More than One Current Source
It is required to analyze the circuit of Figure 6.5 using 
the node-voltage method. The circuit is of the same form 
as that in Figure 6.3, but with different circuit param-
eters and with the uppermost conductance replaced by 
a current source.
Solution:
Recall that in writing the node-voltage equation for a 
given node as a KCL equation, the LHS of the equation 
represents current leaving the node through conduc-
tances, and the RHS represents source current entering 
the node. Hence, in writing the node-voltage equation 
for node ‘a’, a source current leaving the node must be 
entered on the RHS with a negative sign. Alternatively, 
it may be considered that the net source current entering 
node ‘a’ is (12 − 6) A. The equation for node ‘a’ is

Circuit Equations

6.1.1  Change of Reference Node
Consider Figure 6.1a. Any branch voltage is the dif-
ference between two node voltages. For example, 
Vab = Va − Vb. If the same quantity is added to both Va 
and Vb, it will cancel out from the RHS, leaving Vab the 
same. In Example 6.1, node ‘d’ is taken as a reference 
and the node voltages are Va = 9 V, Vb = 6 V, and Vc = 4 V, 
with Vd = 0 because it is the reference node. Suppose 
that after finding the node voltages with respect to node 
‘d’ as reference, we wish to determine the node voltages 
with respect to another node, say, node ‘b’, as reference. 
This means that Vb must be zero. To make Vb = 0 without 
changing the branch voltages, we simply subtract 6 V 
from all the node voltages, which gives Va = 3 V, Vb = 0 V, 
Vc = −2 V, and Vd = −6 V. The branch voltages remain the 
same. Thus, with node ‘d’ as reference, Vab = 9 − 6 = 3 V, 
and with node ‘b’ as reference, Vab = 3 − 0 = 3 V. If the 
branch voltages remain the same, then the branch cur-
rents and KCL will also remain the same.
Concept: In any circuit, the branch voltages and currents are 
independent of the choice of reference node.
Primal Exercise 6.4
Redo Example 6.1 with node ‘b’ as reference and verify 
the new values of node voltages.
6.1.2  Nontransformable Voltage Source
When the node-voltage method is to be used in a circuit 
that has an ideal voltage source in series with a resis-
tance, the combination is conveniently transformed to 
a current source in parallel with the same resistance. 
But when the ideal voltage source does not have a resis-
tance in series with it, it cannot be transformed to a cur-
rent source and must be left unaltered. The circuit of 
Figure 6.7, for example, is the same as that of Figure 6.5, 
but with the 6 A source replaced by a 3 V source that 
cannot be transformed to a current source. In applying 
the node-voltage method, an unknown current IX is 
assigned an arbitrary direction through the voltage 
source and the standard procedure followed, treating IX 
like a source current, in accordance with the substitution 
theorem. The node-voltage equations become

Equation 6.17 is sometimes referred to as the equa-
tion of a “supernode” that results from combining 
nodes ‘a’ and ‘c’. The node-voltage equation for the 
supernode can be written following the usual proce-
dure, without having to introduce an unknown source 
current. However, introducing such a current is more 
fundamental, ­transparent, and less likely to cause an 
error.
Adding two node-voltage equations to eliminate the 
unknown source current reduces the number of inde-
pendent voltage equations derived by one. But an addi-
tional equation in the node voltages is provided by 
the relation between the node voltages and the source 
­voltage. In Figure 6.7,

Equations 6.15, 6.17, and 6.18 are the three indepen-

Vb = 9 V, and Vc = 14 V. These values are the same as 
in Example 6.2, because in this example Vc − Va  =  3, 
as for the voltage source between nodes ‘a’ and ‘c’ in 
Figure 6.7.

Simulate the circuit of Figure 6.7 and verify that KCL, 
KVL, and Ohm’s law are satisfied.

same manner as independent current sources. Consider,

Note that in these equations, the net current entering

Leaving the 0 coefficient in the equations maintains the 
symmetry in the array of coefficients.
In order to solve the node-voltage equations, the con-
trolling variable, Ib in this case, should be expressed in 
terms of the node voltages. In the circuit of Figure 6.8, 
Ib = Vb/3 A. Substituting and moving the term in Vb to 
the LHS, Equations 6.19 through 6.21 become

Solving these equations gives Va = 11 V, Vb = 9 V, and 
Vc = 14 V, the same as in Example 6.2, because in this 
example Ib = 3 A, and 2Ib = 6 A, the same as the indepen-
dent source current. Note that the array of coefficients is 
symmetrical with respect to the diagonal in Equations 
6.19 through 6.21, when 2Ib is on the RHS, but the sym-
metry is destroyed in Equations 6.22 and 6.23 when 2Ib 
is substituted for in terms of Vb and moved to the LHS.
In the case of dependent voltage sources, if the source 
is in series with a resistance, the dependent voltage 
source is transformed to a dependent current source in 
parallel with this resistance, and the standard proce-
dure followed. If the dependent voltage source cannot 
be transformed to a current source, an unknown cur-
rent is assigned to the voltage source, and the procedure 
explained in connection with Figure 6.7 is followed. 
Several examples of this type are included in problems 
at the end of this chapter.
Based on the preceding discussion, we can note 
that the effect of the dependent source in Figure 6.8 is 
to modify some of the conductance coefficients in the 
node-voltage equations, leaving only the values of 
independent source on the RHS of the equations. This 
is in accordance with the argument in Section 4.1, that 
dependent sources alone do not excite a circuit and with 
the argument in connection with Equation 5.10, that 
dependent sources modify the values of resistance coef-
ficients in circuit equations.
Primal Exercise 6.6
Simulate the circuit of Figure 6.8 and verify that KCL, 
KVL, and Ohm’s law are satisfied.
6.2  Mesh-Current Method
Concept: In the mesh-current method, the unknown mesh 
currents are assigned in such a manner that KCL is automati-
cally satisfied at every essential node. Equations based on KVL 
are then written for each mesh directly in terms of Ohm’s law.
The mesh-current method will be illustrated by the 
circuit of Figure 6.9. The first step is to assign a ­current to 
each mesh. Conventionally, mesh currents are assigned 
in a clockwise direction, as illustrated by I1, I2, and I3 in 
the figure. Since the same mesh current enters and leaves

any given node, KCL is automatically satisfied at each 
of the essential nodes ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, and ‘d’. To verify this, 
consider node ‘a’. The mesh current I1 enters node ‘a’ 
through Rsrc and leaves this node through R1. The mesh 
current I2 enters node ‘a’ though R1 and leaves this 
node through R5. The current leaving node ‘a’ through 
R1 is therefore (I1 − I2). Equating the current I1 entering 
node ‘a’ through Rsrc to the total current leaving node ‘a’ 
through R1 and R5 gives I1 = I1 − I2 + I2 = I1, which satisfies 
KCL. The same is true at every other node (Exercise 6.7).
The next step is to write KVL around each mesh. 
Figure 6.10 indicates the voltage drop across each resis-
tor due to the mesh currents flowing through the resistor. 
Considering R1, for example, the net current through R1 is 
(I1 − I2) in the direction of I1, as indicated in Figure 6.9. The 
voltage drop across R1 due to this current is R1(I1 − I2) in 
the direction of I1. This voltage drop is (R1I1 − R1I2), where 
the first term R1I1 is a voltage drop in R1, in the direction 
of I1, due to this current alone, and R1I2 is a voltage drop 
in the direction of I2 but is a voltage rise in the direction of 
I1 due to I2 flowing in R1. The sign of R1I2 is therefore neg-
ative in the expression for the net voltage drop R1(I1 − I2) 
in the direction of I1. Similarly, the net voltage drop across 
R2 is R2(I1 − I3) in the direction of I1. The total voltage drop 
in the direction of I1 due to the resistances in the mesh is 
therefore RsrcI1 + R1(I1 − I2) + R2(I1 − I3). According to KVL, 
the total voltage drop due to the resistances in the mesh 
must be equal to the voltage rise due to any sources in the 
mesh. This voltage rise in mesh 1 is VSRC in the direction 
of I1. Equating the voltage drop to the voltage rise and 
collecting terms in the mesh currents give

The term (Rsrc + R1 + R2)I1 is the voltage drop in mesh 1 
due to I1 alone. As explained previously, the negative 
sign of the terms R1I2 and R2I3 is due to the fact that these 
terms represent voltage rises in mesh 1 in the direction 
of I1 and would therefore have a negative sign as voltage 
drops in mesh 1 in the direction of I1.
In mesh 2, the net current in R1 in the direction of I2 
is (I2 − I1) and the voltage drop in R1 in the direction 
of I2 is R1(I2 − I1). Similarly, the net current in R3 in the 
direction of I2 is (I2 − I3) and the voltage drop in R3 in 
the direction of I2 is R3(I2 − I3). The total voltage drop 
in the direction of I2 due to the resistances in mesh 2 is 
R1(I2 − I1) + R5I2 + R3(I2 − I3). As there are no sources in 
mesh 2, this total voltage drop must be equal to zero. 
Collecting terms in the mesh currents gives the mesh-
current equation for mesh 2 as

In mesh 3, the net current in R2 in the direction of I3

direction of I3 is (I3 − I2) and the voltage drop in R3 in 
the direction of I3 is R3(I3 − I2). The total voltage drop 
in the direction of I3 due to the resistances in mesh 3 is 
R2(I3 − I1) + R4I3 + R3(I3 − I2). As there are no sources in 
mesh 3, this total voltage drop must be equal to zero.

Comparing Equations 6.25 through 6.27 reveals a pat-
tern that allows writing the mesh-current equations by 
inspection:
	
1.	In the equation for a given mesh, the coeffi-
cient multiplying the mesh current is the sum 
of all the resistances in the mesh. Thus, in 
the equation for mesh 1 (Equation 6.25), I1 is 
multiplied by (Rsrc + R1 + R2). Similarly, in the 
equation for mesh 2 (Equation 6.26), I2 is mul-
tiplied by (R1  +  R3  +  R5), and in the equation 
for mesh 3 (Equation 6.27), I3 is multiplied by 
(R2 + R3 + R4).These coefficients are known as the 
self-­resistances of the meshes.
	
2.	In the equation for a given mesh, the coefficient 
multiplying the current of each of the other 
meshes is the resistance that is common to the 
two meshes, with a minus sign. Thus, in the 
equation for mesh 1 (Equation 6.25), I2 is mul-
tiplied by −R1, where R1 is the resistance that is 
common between meshes 1 and 2, and the minus 
sign is because R1I2 is a voltage rise in mesh 1 
(Figure 6.10). I3 is multiplied by −R2, where R2 is 
the resistance that is common between meshes 
1 and 3. The same is true of the other mesh 
equations. These coefficients are known as the 
mutual resistances between the meshes. If there 
is no resistance that is common between a cer-
tain mesh with the mesh in question, the corre-
sponding mutual resistance is zero.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
If the coefficients of the mesh currents in Equations 6.25 
through 6.27 are arranged in an array, as illustrated in 
Figure 6.11, the array has the following features that are 
a useful check on the correctness of the mesh-current 
equations:
	
1.	The self-resistances are the diagonal entries in 
the array from top left to bottom right.
	
2.	The array is symmetrical with respect to this 
diagonal, as illustrated by the coefficients 
pointed to by the double-sided arrows in 
Figure  6.11. This symmetry is because the 
same resistance that is common between two 
meshes appears in the equation of each of the 
two meshes as a multiplier of the current in the 
other mesh, the resistance being independent 
of the direction of current. It will be shown in 
the next section that this symmetry is destroyed 
when the dependency relations of dependent 
sources are taken into account.
	
3.	In any row or column, the mutual resistances are 
part of the self-resistance in that row or ­column. 
The remaining resistance is that exclusive to the 
mesh.
The procedure for writing the mesh-current equation 
for a given mesh ‘n’ can be summarized as follows:
	
1.	The current of mesh ‘n’ is multiplied by the sum of 
all the resistances in the mesh.
	
2.	The current of every other mesh is multiplied by the 
resistance that is common between this mesh and 
mesh ‘n’, with a negative sign. If there is no such 
resistance, the coefficient is zero.
	
3.	The LHS of the mesh-current equation for mesh ‘n’ 
is the sum of the terms from the preceding steps, 
ordered as the unknown mesh currents. This sum is 
the total voltage drop, in the direction of the mesh 
current, due to all the resistances in the mesh.
	
4.	The RHS of the equation is equal to the algebraic sum 
of source voltages in mesh ‘n’. A source voltage that 
is a voltage rise in the direction of the mesh current 
has a positive sign, whereas a source voltage that is a 
voltage drop in the direction of the mesh current has 
a negative sign.
It must be remembered that in the mesh-current equa-
tions, KVL around any mesh is satisfied by having the 
LHS and the RHS in the following form:
Sum of voltage drops in the direction of the mesh current due to 
the resistances in the mesh = Algebraic sum of voltage rises in the 
direction of the mesh current due to voltage sources in the mesh.

Example 6.4:  Mesh-Current Method 
with More than One Voltage Source
It is required to analyze the circuit of Figure 6.14 using the 
mesh-current method. The circuit is of the same form as 
that in Figure 6.12, but with different circuit parameters 
and with the 3 Ω resistance replaced by an 8 V source.
Solution:
Following the standard procedure and starting with 
mesh 1, the self-resistance of this mesh is (2 + 8) Ω; the 
mutual resistance with mesh 2 is zero, since there is no 
common resistance with this mesh; and the mutual resis-
tance with mesh 3 is 8 Ω. The LHS of the mesh-current 
equation, which accounts for the total voltage drop 
in the direction of I1 due to the resistances in mesh 1 is 
(2 + 8)I1 + 0 × I2 − 8I3. The source voltage of the 12 V source 
is a voltage rise in the direction of I1, and the source volt-
age of the 8 V source is a voltage drop in the direction 
of I1. The net voltage rise in the direction of I1 due to the 
voltage sources in mesh 1 is (12 − 8) V. The mesh-current 
equation for mesh 1 is therefore

the 4 Ω resistance.

and determine I1, I2, and I3. Simulate the circuit and 
­verify  the values of the mesh currents, KVL, and 
Ohm’s law.
Ans. I1 = 3 A, I2 = 0.125 A, and I3 = 1.25 A.
★6.2.1  Generalization of Mesh-Current Method
It is sometimes convenient not to take all mesh currents 
in the same sense or to consider as a variable a loop cur-
rent rather than a mesh current. Compared to Figure 6.12, 
for example, I1 in Figure 6.16 is the current in the outer 
loop, I2 is the current in the same mesh 2, and I3 is the cur-
rent in the same mesh 3 but in a counterclockwise sense. 
How can the equations relating I1, I2, and I3 be written in 
the same form as the previously described mesh-current 
equations? Doing so enhances the understanding of how 
KVL is applied in a more general context.
Considering loop 1, the self-resistance of the loop is 
(2 + 10 + 4) Ω. The voltage drop in the direction of I1 due 
to the self-resistance of the loop is (2 + 10 + 4)I1. The 
mutual resistance between loop 1 and mesh 2 is the 10 Ω 
resistance. But I1 and I2 flow in the same direction in this 
resistance so that the voltage across this resistance due 
to I2 is a voltage drop 10I2 in loop 1 in the direction of I1, 
just like the voltage drop 10I1 in this resistance due to I1. 
The mutual resistance between loop 1 and mesh 3 is the 
4 Ω resistance. But with I1 and I3 flowing in opposite 
directions in this resistance, I3 produces a voltage rise 4I3 
in loop 1, which subtracts from the total voltage drop in 
the direction of I1 in loop 1. The net voltage drop in the 
direction of I1 in loop 1 is therefore (2 + 10 + 4)I1 + 10I2 − 
4I3 = 16I1 + 10I2 − 4I3. The voltage rise due to source volt-
ages in loop 1 is 12 V. Hence, the loop-current equation 
for this loop is

Considering mesh 2, the voltage drop in the direction 
of I2 due to the self-resistance of the mesh is (10 + 4 + 3)I2. 
I1 flowing in the 10 Ω resistance and I3 flowing in the 4 Ω 
resistance common with mesh 3 both add to the voltage 
drop in mesh 2. The total voltage drop in the direction 
of I2 in mesh 2 is therefore (10 + 4 + 3)I2 + 10I1 + 4I3 = 
17I2+ 10I1 + 4I3. With no sources in mesh 2, the mesh-
current equation for mesh 2 is

Considering mesh 3, the voltage drop in the direction

I1 flowing in the common 4 Ω resistance on the right 
produces a voltage rise in mesh 3, whereas I2 flowing 
in the common 4 Ω resistance produces a voltage drop 
in mesh  3. The net voltage drop in the direction of I3 
in mesh 3 is therefore (12 + 4 + 4)I3 − 4I1 + 4I2 = 20I2 − 
4I1 + 4I2. With no sources in mesh 3, the mesh-current

Equations 6.40 through 6.42 are the three indepen-
dent equations that can be solved to give I1  =  1.5  A, 
I2 = −1 A, and I3 = 0.5 A. These values are in agreement 
with those derived for the same circuit in Example 6.3. 
The current in the 12 V source is 1.5 A, the current in 
the 10 Ω ­resistance is I1 + I2 = 0.5 A, and the current in the 
4 Ω resistance on the side is I1 − I3 = 1 A.
When using loop currents, with or without mesh 
­currents, the following should be noted:
	
1.	The only modification from the standard proce-
dure is that if the loop or mesh currents flow in 
the same direction in a mutual resistance, this 
resistance is written with a positive sign in the 
mesh-current equations.
	
2.	The number of independent equations is the 
same as the number of meshes in the circuit.
	
3.	The array of coefficients is symmetrical 
with respect to the diagonal, in the absence 
of dependent sources, as in Equations 6.40 
through 6.42. The symmetry also applies in 
the presence of dependent sources, before the 
dependency relations are taken into account, 
as discussed in connection with Equations 6.22 
and 6.23.

6.2.2  Nontransformable Current Source
When the mesh-current method is to be used in a cir-
cuit that has an ideal current source in parallel with a 
resistance, the combination is conveniently transformed 
to a voltage source in series with the same resistance. 
But when the ideal current source does not have a 
resistance in parallel with it, it cannot be transformed 
to a voltage source and must be left unaltered. The cir-
cuit of Figure 6.17, for example, is the same as that of 
Figure 6.14, except that the 8 V source has been replaced 
by a current source that cannot be transformed to a volt-
age source. An unknown voltage VX of arbitrary polar-
ity is assumed across the current source and is treated 
like a source voltage, in accordance with the substitu-
tion theorem. The mesh-current equations become

Equation 6.46 is sometimes referred to as the equation 
of a “supermesh” that results from combining meshes 
1 and 2. The mesh-current equation for the supermesh 
can be written following the usual procedure, with-
out ­having to introduce an unknown source voltage. 
However, introducing such a voltage is more fundamen-
tal, transparent, and less likely to cause an error.
Adding two mesh-current equations reduces the 
­number of independent mesh-current equations derived 
by one. But an additional equation is provided by the 
relation between the mesh currents and the source 
­current. From Figure 6.17,

and I3 = 0.75 A. These values are the same as in Example 
6.4, because I1 − I2 = 0.125 A, as for the current source 
between meshes 1 and 2.

6.3  Dependent Sources in Mesh-Current

Dependent voltage sources are treated in exactly the 
same manner as independent voltage sources. Consider, 
for example, the circuit of Figure 6.18, which is the same 
as that of Figure 6.13 but with the 8 V independent source 
replaced by a dependent voltage source. The mesh-­
current equations are written in the usual way as follows:

Solving these equations gives I1 = 1 A, I2 = 0.875 A, 
and I3 = 0.75 A, the same as in Example 6.4, because in 
this example Ib = 0.25 A and 32Ib = 8 V, the same as the 
independent source voltage. Note that the array of coef-
ficients is symmetrical with respect to the diagonal in 
Equations 6.48 through 6.50, when 32Ib is on the RHS, 
but the symmetry is destroyed in Equations 6.51 through 
6.53 when 32Ib is substituted for in terms of I1 and I3 and 
moved to the LHS. Again, the effect of the dependent 
source is to modify some of the ­resistance coefficients in 
the mesh-current equations.
In the case of dependent current sources, if the 
source is in parallel with a resistance, the dependent 
current source is transformed to a dependent voltage 
source, and the standard procedure followed. If the 
dependent current source cannot be transformed to a 
current source, an unknown voltage is assigned across 
the current source, and the procedure explained in con-
nection with Figure 6.17 is followed. Several examples 
of this type are included in problems at the end of this 
chapter.
Primal Exercise 6.12
Simulate the circuit of Figure 6.18 and verify that KCL, 
KVL, and Ohm’s law are satisfied.
6.4  Problem-Solving Approach Updated
The main procedural steps of the ISDEPIC approach are 
summarized and updated in the following in light of the 
material covered in this chapter:
Step 1—Initialize:
	 (a)	 Mark on the circuit diagram all given values 
of circuit parameters, currents and voltages, as 
well as the unknowns to be determined.
	 (b)	 Label the nodes, as this may be generally helpful.
	 (c)	 If the solution requires that a given value of cur-
rent or voltage be satisfied, assume this value 
from the very beginning.
Step 2—Simplify: Consider, as may be appropriate, the 
following:
	 (a)	 Redrawing the circuit.
	 (b)	 Replacing series and parallel combinations of 
circuit elements by an equivalent circuit element,
	 (c)	 Applying star-delta transformation.
	 (d)	 Removing resistors that are redundant as far as 
the variables of interest are concerned.
	 (e)	 Using shunt-connected ideal voltage sources or 
series-connected ideal current sources to parti-
tion the circuit.
	 (f)	 Exploiting symmetry.
Step 3—Deduce: Determine any values of current or volt-
age that follow immediately from direct application of 
Ohm’s law, KCL, or KVL, without introducing any addi-
tional unknowns.
Step 4—Explore: Examine each of the following alterna-
tives, as may be applicable:
	 (a)	 Consider the nodes and meshes in the circuit to 
see if KCL or KVL can be satisfied by assign-
ment of a single unknown current or voltage, 
and if this unknown can then be directly deter-
mined from KCL or KVL.
	 (b)	 Apply source transformation.
	 (c)	 Use TEC or NEC to (i) determine a voltage or a 
current through a given circuit element, or (ii) 
simplify part of the circuit.
	 (d)	 Apply the substitution or source absorption 
theorems.
	 (e)	 Apply superposition if more than one source is 
present in the circuit.
	 (f)	 Use output scaling.
	 (g)	 Rearrange sources.
Step 5—Plan: Think carefully and creatively about the 
problem in the light of circuit fundamentals and circuit 
analysis techniques. Consider alternative solutions and 
select what seems to be the simplest and most direct 
solution, including the node-voltage or mesh-current 
method.
Step 6—Implement: Carry out your planned solution.
Step 7—Check: your calculations and results.
	 (a)	 Check that your results make sense, in terms of 
magnitude and sign.
	 (b)	 Check that Ohm’s law is satisfied across every 
resistor, that KCL is satisfied at every node, and 
that KVL is satisfied around every mesh.

Circuit Equations	
157
	 (c)	 Seek an alternative solution to see if it gives the 
same result.
	 (d)	 Whenever feasible, check simulation with PSpice.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 In the node-voltage method, voltages of essen-
tial nodes are assigned with respect to one of the 
essential nodes taken as a reference. This auto-
matically satisfies KVL in every mesh in the cir-
cuit. Equations based on KCL are then written 
directly in terms of Ohm’s law for each essential 
node other than the reference node.
•	 The procedure for writing the node-voltage 
equation for a given essential node ‘n’ can be 
summarized as follows:
	
1.	 The voltage of node ‘n’ is multiplied by 
the sum of all the conductances connected 
directly to this node, which means that node 
‘n’ constitutes one terminal for each of these 
conductances.
	
2.	 The voltage of every other node is mul-
tiplied by the conductance connected 
directly between this node and node ‘n’, 
with a negative sign. A conductance is 
directly connected between two nodes, 
if each node is a terminal for the conduc-
tance. If there is no such conductance, the 
coefficient is zero.
	
3.	 The LHS of the node-voltage equation for 
node ‘n’ is the sum of the terms from the 
preceding steps, ordered as the unknown 
node voltages. This sum is the total current 
leaving node ‘n’ through the conductances 
connected to this node.
	
4.	 The RHS of the equation is equal to the alge-
braic sum of source currents entering node 
‘n’. Thus, a source current entering node ‘n’ 
will have a positive sign, whereas a source 
current leaving node ‘n’ will have a negative 
sign.
•	 In any circuit, the branch voltages and cur-
rents are independent of the choice of reference 
node.
•	 In the mesh-current method, the unknown 
mesh currents are assigned in such a manner 
that KCL is automatically satisfied at every 
essential node. Equations based on KVL are 
then written for each mesh directly in terms of 
Ohm’s law.
•	 The procedure for writing the mesh-current 
equation for a given mesh ‘n’ can be summa-
rized as follows:
	
1.	 The current of mesh ‘n’ is multiplied by the 
sum of all the resistances in the mesh.
	
2.	 The current of every other mesh is mul-
tiplied by the resistance that is common 
between this mesh and mesh ‘n’, with a neg-
ative sign. If there is no such resistance, the 
coefficient is zero.
	
3.	 The LHS of the mesh-current equation for 
mesh ‘n’ is the sum of the terms from the 
preceding steps, ordered as the unknown 
mesh currents. This sum is the total voltage 
drop, in the direction of the mesh current, 
due to all the resistances in the mesh.
	
4.	 The RHS of the equation is equal to the alge-
braic sum of source voltages in mesh ‘n’. A 
source voltage that is a voltage rise in the 
direction of the mesh current has a positive 
sign, whereas a source voltage that is a volt-
age drop in the direction of the mesh current 
has a negative sign.
•	 In writing the node-voltage and mesh-current 
equations, dependent sources are treated in 
exactly the same way as independent sources.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	A useful check on the node-voltage and mesh-
current equations is that the array of coefficients 
on the left-hand side of the equations should be 
symmetrical about the diagonal, from top left to 
bottom right. For the purpose of this check, zero 
coefficients must be included and dependent 
sources should appear as sources on the right-
hand side of the equations.
	
2.	An additional check is that in any row or col-
umn, the mutual conductances (resistances) are 
part of the self-conductances (resistances) in 
that row or column.

Objective and Overview
This chapter considers the fundamental properties of 
capacitors and inductors and introduces the very useful 
concept of duality in electric circuits.
The preceding chapters dealt with the analysis of 
resistive circuits only, in the dc steady state. Before 
discussing circuits in the sinusoidal steady state in 
the following chapters, the present chapter introduces 
some fundamental considerations on capacitors and 
inductors, including the capacitance and inductance of 
prototypical devices, voltage–current relations, stored 
energy, and the equivalent capacitance and induc-
tance of capacitors and inductors in series or in paral-
lel. Before discussing inductors, some basic notions on 
electromagnetism are considered.
The chapter concludes with an introduction of the 
very useful concept of duality in electric circuits, start-
ing with duality of the relations for capacitors and 
inductors. Duality can be a useful aid in analyzing elec-
tric circuits involving energy storage elements.
7.1  Voltage–Current Relation of a Capacitor
Concept: The fundamental attribute of a capacitor is its abil-
ity to store energy in the electric field resulting from separated 
positive and negative electric charges.
The ability of a capacitor to store electric energy under-
lies its use in electric circuits to account for the electric 
energy stored in the electromagnetic field, as discussed 
in Section 1.9.
Figure 7.1a shows a prototypical capacitor consist-
ing of two parallel metal plates, d m apart, each having 
an area of A m2. The space between the plates is filled 
with a dielectric material of permittivity, or dielectric 
­constant, ε farads/m. If the capacitor is momentarily 
connected to a source of voltage v, it acquires a charge 
+q on the plate connected to the positive terminal of the 
source and an equal and opposite charge −q on the plate 
connected to the negative terminal (Figure 7.1b). In an 
ideal capacitor, the charge on the capacitor is directly 
proportional to the voltage across it:
	
q
Cv
=
	
(7.1)
where C is the capacitance of the capacitor. C is a 
­positive constant for an ideal capacitor, so q and v are 
linearly related. If q is in coulombs and v is in volts, C is 
in farads (F). Moreover, there is no power dissipation in 
an ideal capacitor. This implies that the insulation of the 
dielectric is perfect, that is, there is no leakage of charge 
between the plates of the capacitor, through the dielec-
tric, so that the initial charge of an ideal, isolated capaci-
tor is retained indefinitely.
The capacitance of the parallel-plate capacitor shown 
in Figure 7.1 can be readily calculated from elemen-
tary principles of electrostatics, with some simplifying 
assumptions. It will be assumed that the electric field ξ 
everywhere between the plates is normal to the surface 
of the plates and given by v/d V/m. This neglects fringe 
effects, which cause the electric field to curve outwards 
near the edges of the plates. If a cylinder of cross-­
sectional area ΔA m2 is imagined to be oriented so that 
its sides are normal to the upper plate and extend above

and below this plate, without reaching the lower plate 
(Figure 7.1c), then the charge enclosed by the cylinder 
may be denoted as σΔA, where σ is the charge density 
q/A, assumed to be uniform all over the plate. From 
Gauss’s law of electrostatics, the electric displacement 
D is equal to σ, where D = εξ. Substituting D = q/A and 
ξ = v/d, in this relation,

In general, capacitors can take many different 
forms, depending on the nature of the system and its 
geometry, which dictate how the electric field varies 
throughout the system. As exemplified by Equation 
7.3, it is ­generally true that capacitance increases 
(1) with the permittivity of the dielectric between the 
conductive surfaces, (2) with the area of these sur-
faces, and (3) as the separation between these surfaces 
decreases. Note that, from Equation 7.3, the units of ε 
are farads/meter.
The charge q on the capacitor is related to the current 
i through the capacitor, by the defining relation for cur-
rent as i(t) = dq/dt, or

where Q0 is any initial charge on the capacitor at t = 0. 
Note that the indefinite integral in Equation 7.4 does 
not explicitly involve Q0, which is in fact the constant of 
integration in this case. On the other hand, Q0 appears 
explicitly as the constant of integration in the expression 
for q in terms of the definite integral from t = 0 to any 
time t. From Equations 7.1 and 7.4,

7.1.1  Sign Convention
It should be noted that a definite sign convention is 
implied in writing Equations 7.5 and 7.6 with a posi-
tive sign on the RHS. The positive sign applies when the 
capacitor current i is assigned in the direction of a volt-
age drop v across the capacitor. But if i is assigned in the 
direction of a voltage rise v, then a negative sign should 
be used. This change of sign can be associated with the 
passive sign convention (Section 1.7) but will be justified 
next by the inherently positive value of C and by the 
flow of charge in a capacitor due to a change in voltage 
across the capacitor.
Suppose that i is in the direction of a voltage drop v, as 
in Figure 7.2. Since C is a positive quantity for a physical 
capacitor, then the value of i must be positive when the 
value of dv/dt is positive in Equation 7.6. If i > 0, then 
positive charges can be considered to flow into the posi-
tively charged plate (Figure 7.2a), thereby increasing the 
charge on the capacitor and hence the voltage across the 
capacitor, which means dv/dt > 0. With both i and dv/dt 
positive, then for C to be positive, a positive sign should 
be used in Equations 7.5 and 7.6.
On the other hand, if i  <  0, positive charges can be 
­considered to flow out of the positively charged plate 
(Figure 7.2b). The charge on the capacitor, and hence the 
voltage across it, will decrease, which means dv/dt < 0. 
With both i and dv/dt negative, C is again positive in 
Equations 7.5 and 7.6. This justifies writing these equations 
with a positive sign when i is in the direction of a voltage 
drop v.
Whereas for an ideal resistor, the assigned positive 
directions of v and i are always such that i is in the direc-
tion of a voltage drop v, this does not apply to a capaci-
tor. The reason is that a resistor that obeys Ohm’s law 
always dissipates power. On the other hand, a capaci-
tor may actually absorb power when it is charging, or it 
may actually deliver power when it is discharging.
In Figure 7.2, for v positive as shown, a positive i 
gives a positive p = vi for power absorbed, as argued 
in Example 1.4. If power is actually being delivered,

then the value of vi in Figure 7.2 is negative. To obtain 
a positive value for power delivered, as is convenient 
in some cases, the assigned positive directions of v 
and i in Figure 7.1 must be reversed relative to one 
another, as in Figure 7.3, where the assigned positive 
direction of i is reversed. But now, a positive i implies 
that positive charges are flowing out of the positively 
charged plate, which means that v is decreasing, so that 
dv/dt < 0 (Figure 7.3a). To have a positive value of C 
in the voltage–current relation, Equations 7.5 and 7.6 
must be written with a negative sign as
	
v t

and

(7.8)
If i in Figure 7.3b has a negative value, then charges are 
flowing into the positively charged plate, v is increasing, 
so that dv/dt > 0. With i negative and dv/dt positive, C is 
again positive in Equations 7.7 and 7.8.
It should be noted that since the insulation in an ideal 
capacitor is perfect, and a perfect insulator does not 
allow movement of charge through it, the current in a 
capacitor cannot be a conduction current due to move-
ment of charge from one plate of the capacitor to the 
other, through the insulation. Rather, the capacitor cur-
rent is a displacement current. A simple interpretation 
of this current is to consider that the current i flowing 
into the positive terminal of the capacitor increases the 
positive charge on the positive plate of the capacitor by 
an amount dq in a time dt, where d
d
q
i t
=
. The positive 
charge dq “displaces”, through electrostatic repulsion, 
an equal positive charge dq from the negative plate. The 
displaced positive charge dq flows out of the negative 
terminal, thereby completing the current path through 
the capacitor, without any conduction current actually 
flowing between the plates of the capacitor. At the end 
of the time interval dt, the charge on the positive plate 
of the capacitor is + +

7.1.2  Steady Capacitor Voltage
By a steady capacitor voltage is meant a voltage across 
the capacitor that is constant for a specified duration. In 
contrast, a dc voltage is, strictly speaking and from a sig-
nal analysis viewpoint, a steady voltage over all time, 
from t = −∞ to t = +∞. An example of a steady capacitor 
voltage is the voltage from t = 1 s to t = 2 s in Figure 7.5. 
A steady current is defined in a similar manner as a cur-
rent that is constant for a specified duration.
When the capacitor voltage is a steady voltage VSD, the 
charge on the capacitor does not change with time, so 
that i(t) = CdVSD/dt = 0, in accordance with Equation 7.6. 
In other words, the capacitor acts as an open circuit when 
the voltage across the capacitor is steady, as illustrated in 
Figure 7.4a. The same is true, of course, of a dc voltage, 
VDC, since dVDC/dt = 0. A capacitor is said to “block” cur-
rent due to a dc voltage and is often used in electronic 
circuits for this purpose.
However, it must be noted that a steady current can 
be forced through a capacitor by an ideal, steady cur-
rent source ISD (Figure 7.4b). Assuming the capacitor is 
initially uncharged, then from Equation 7.5,

(7.9)
The capacitor voltage increases linearly with time, at 
a rate ISD/C, during the interval in which the capacitor 
current is steady and therefore constant with respect to 
time (Figure 7.4b). Conversely, a capacitor voltage that 
increases linearly with time produces a steady capacitor

current. Thus, it follows from Figure 7.4b that if a ­voltage 
v = ISDt/C is applied to a capacitor, i(t) = Cdv/dt = ISD.
7.1.3  Stored Energy
The energy stored in the electric field of a capacitor is 
equal to the work done in separating the charges +q and 
−q, in opposition to the force of attraction between them. 
If a capacitor is being charged, and referring to Figure 7.2, 
the power input to the capacitor at any instant of time is 
p = vi = vdq/dt. The energy w absorbed by the capacitor in 
building up the charge on the capacitor from 0 to a value 
q is the time integral of p, in accordance with Equation 1.9. 
Assuming that the voltage is applied at t = 0 with q = 0 for 
t ≤ 0, the energy supplied over the interval from t = 0 to t is

having plates of 4 × 3 cm, separated by 0.5 cm filled with 
an insulator having a relative permittivity 5000ε0, where 
ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12 F/m is the permittivity of free space.
Ans. 10.62 nF.

An ideal, parallel-plate capacitor of 10  μF is charged 
to 1 V. If the separation between the parallel plates is 
doubled, determine the voltage across the capacitor. 
Compare the stored energies before and after the dis-
tance is doubled and explain the difference.
Ans. 2  V. Stored energy is doubled from 5 J to 10 J 
because of work done against attraction between plates.

the capacitor energy as a function of time and determine 
the difference between the maximum and minimum 
energy stored in the capacitor.
Ans. w(t) = (cos2t – 1) μJ, 2 μJ.
Example 7.1:   Capacitor Response 
to a Trapezoidal Voltage
The voltage shown in Figure 7.5 is applied to a 1 mF capac-
itor that is initially uncharged. Determine as a function 
of time (a) the charge on the capacitor, (b) the capaci-
tor current, (c) the power absorbed by the capacitor, and 
(d) the energy absorbed by the capacitor. Assume the 
assigned positive directions of Figure 7.2.
Solution:
	 (a)	 Since various quantities are required as a function 
of time, v should be expressed analytically as a 
function of time. Thus, v(t) = 5t V 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s, and 
v(t) = 5 V, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s; v(t) in the range 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s 
can be conveniently derived as follows: the slope 
of v with respect to t is −5/0.5 = −10 V/s in this 
range. The function v(t) = −10t has the same slope 
but passes through the origin. The required func-
tion is displaced by 2.5 s to the right, so its equa-
tion is obtained by substituting (t – 2.5) for t, 
giving: v(t) = −10(t – 2.5) V, 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s. As a check, 
v(t) = 5 V when t = 2 s, and v(t) = 0 when t = 2.5 s.
From Equation 7.1, q = Cv = 10−6 × v coulombs = v 
microcoulombs (μC). It follows that q(t) = 5t μC, 
0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s; q(t) = 5 μC, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s; q(t) = 10(2.5 – t) 
μC, 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s; and q(t) = 0, t ≥ 2.5 s (Figure 7.6a).
	 (b)	 i(t) = dq/dt; hence, i(t) = 5 μC/s = 5 μA, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s; 
i(t) = 0, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s during the time that v is steady; 
i(t) = −10 μA, 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s; and i(t) = 0, t ≥ 2.5 s 
(Figure 7.6b). Note that since q starts and ends 
with zero, the positive area of the i vs. t graph is 
equal in magnitude to the negative area.
	 (c)	 p = vi; multiplying v and i over the various time 
ranges gives p(t) = 25t μW, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s; p(t) = 0, 
1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s; p(t) = −100(2.5 – t), 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s; and 
p(t)  =  0, t  ≥  2.5  s (Figure 7.6c). Note that the 
capacitor charges and absorbs power during the 
interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s while v and i are positive. No 
power is absorbed or delivered during the inter-
val 1  ≤  t  ≤  2  s when i  =  0. During the interval 
2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s, i < 0, the capacitor discharges and 
delivers power. At t = 2.5 s, q = 0, and the capacitor 
is fully discharged. This means that all the energy 
absorbed during the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s is returned

Since energy is the area under the power curve, 
the positive area of the triangle extending from 
t = 0 to t = 1 s, which is 12.5 μJ, must be equal 
in magnitude to the negative area extending from 
t = 2 to t = 2.5 s, which is in fact −12.5 μJ.

with t is shown in Figure 7.6d. Note that since the 
voltage returns to zero for t ≥ 2.5 s, w = 0.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 7.7. The 
capacitor is entered from the ANALOG_P library, because 
this capacitor has terminals 1 and 2 marked for convenience 
in determining unambiguously the assigned positive 
directions of capacitor voltage and current. The conven-
tion in PSpice is that positive current flows from terminal 
1 to terminal 2 through any circuit element and that posi-
tive voltage is that of terminal 1 with respect to terminal 2. 
When using time-domain analysis, as in this case, initial 
conditions of energy storage elements should be specified, 
even if they are zero. To do so, display the Property Editor 
spreadsheet for the capacitor and enter 0 in the IC column. 
To display this entry, click on the Display button and select 
‘Name and Value’ under ‘Display Format’. The source is 
VPWL (piecewise-linear voltage source) from the source 
library, with the breakpoints entered as voltage values at 
the corresponding times in the Property Editor spread-
sheet for the source (Appendix C). They are displayed in 
the same manner as the initial conditions for the capaci-
tor just described. In the Simulation Settings, ‘Analysis 
type’ is ‘Time Domain (Transient)’, ‘Run to time’ is 3  s, 
‘Start Saving Data After’ is 0, and ‘Maximum Step size’ is 
0.5 m. After the simulation is run, then in order to display 
the current and power dissipated to appropriate vertical 
scales, select Trace/Add Trace in the Schematic1 window 
and enter 10*I(C1:1),W(C1). The time variation of capacitor 
current and dissipated power is displayed, as in Figure 7.8.
Primal Exercise 7.4
Repeat Example 7.1 assuming the voltage increases 
­linearly from 0 to 5 V in 0.5 s, stays at 5 V for 1 s, then 
decreases linearly to zero in 1 s.
Ans. 0 < t < 0.5 s: q(t) = 10t μC, i(t) = 10 μA, p(t) = 100t μW, 
w(t) = 50t2 μJ; 0.5 < t < 1.5 s: q(t) = 5 μC, i(t) = 0, p(t) = 0, 
w(t) = 12.5 μJ; 1.5 < t < 2.5 s: q(t) = –5t + 12.5 μC, i(t) = –5 μA,

7.2  Voltage–Current Relation of an Inductor
Before considering the v–i relation for the ideal induc-
tor, some basic notions of electromagnetism will be 
reviewed.
7.2.1  Magnetic Fields and Related Quantities
A permanent magnet is surrounded by a magnetic 
field, in which a force is exerted on a magnetic object 
such as a compass needle, which is itself a small perma-
nent ­magnet. The magnetic field can be conveniently 
visualized by means of imaginary lines referred to as 
magnetic field lines, as illustrated in Figure 7.11 for a 
bar magnet. Magnetic field lines are considered to be 
directed from the north pole of the magnet to its south 
pole, as indicated by the arrows on the lines. At any 
point along a field line, the direction of the tangent to 
the field line is the direction of the magnetic field at 
that point.
Magnetic field lines not only give the direction of 
the magnetic field but their density is indicative of the 
strength of the magnetic field, where density refers to 
the number of lines per unit area oriented normal to the 
direction of the lines.

The totality of magnetic field lines emanating from 
the north pole of a magnet, or converging onto its south 
pole, is the magnetic flux of the magnet. The stronger 
the magnet, the larger the flux, the higher is the density 
of the magnetic field lines, and the stronger is the mag-
netic field. The unit of magnetic flux in SI units is the 
weber (Wb).
A magnetic field is associated with moving electric 
charges. The magnetic field lines for a long and straight 
current-carrying wire form concentric circles around 
the wire, in any plane normal to the wire (Figure 7.12). 
The direction of the magnetic field is related to that of 
the current by the right-hand rule: If the wire is gripped 
with the right hand, with the thumb extended in the 
direction of the current, the fingers point in the direction 
of the magnetic field. A basic quantity of the magnetic 
field is the magnetic field strength vector

where the circle around the integral signifies integra-
tion around a closed path, dl is an increment of distance 
along this closed path, and Ienc is the current enclosed 
in traversing the closed path once. 

H is a vector having 
magnitude and direction. In the first form of the integral 
in Equation 7.12, Hl is the component of

in the form of the second integral in Equation 7.12, as 
the scalar product of the two vectors

. It is 
seen from Equation 7.12 that the unit of H in SI units is 
amperes/meter (A/m).
In the case of a long, straight wire carrying a dc cur-
rent, 

H is of constant magnitude H around a circle of 
radius r centered on the wire in a plane normal to the 
wire (Figure 7.12a), and 

H is directed tangentially at 
every point along the circumference of the circle. The 
line integral over a circle of radius r is simply 2πrH in 
this case, and Ienc = I. Substituting in Equation 7.12,

where μ0 is the permeability of free space (4π × 10−7 N/A2 
or henries/m, the henry being the unit of inductance, as 
explained in Section 7.4) and μr is the relative perme-
ability of the medium with respect to that of free space; 
that is, μr is the ratio of the permeability of the given 
medium to that of free space. Permeability is an impor-
tant magnetic property of the medium, as discussed 
later. For the current-carrying conductor of Figure 7.12a, 
the flux density is the flux per unit area in the plane of 
the wire (Figure 7.12b). It is denoted by Bn, where the 
subscript ‘n’ emphasizes that the flux density is normal 
to the plane of the wire. Being flux density, the unit of B 
is the tesla (T), equivalent to 1 Wb/m2.
An essential difference between H and B is that H is 
directly related to current, independently of the mag-
netic properties of the medium surrounding the current-­
carrying conductor. B, on the other hand, is directly 
related to voltage, through Faraday’s law (Equation 7.18, 
discussed later), independently of the magnetic

properties of the medium. This implies that B and H must 
be related by the magnetic properties of the medium, as 
in Equation  7.14. Evidently, the stronger the magnetic 
field, the stronger is the magnetic field strength, H, and 
the larger is the magnetic flux density, B. The magnetic 
properties of a medium arise from the magnetic fields 
generated internally in the material in response to the 
applied magnetic field. In materials of high permeability, 
the magnetic effects due to the material play a dominant 
role in the magnetic behavior of the material.
7.2.2  Magnetic Flux Linkage
Consider a single turn of wire through which mag-
netic flux passes (Figure 7.13a). The magnetic flux link-
ing the turn is simply the magnetic flux passing through 
the area enclosed by the turn, in the direction normal to 
the plane of the turn. This flux is the integral, over the 
area of the turn, of Bn, the component of magnetic flux 
density B that is normal to the plane of the turn, multi-
plied by 1 for a single turn:

(7.15)
In Equation 7.15, the integral in brackets is ϕn, the 
normal component of the flux through the turn; ϕn 
multiplied by ‘1’ for a single turn is the magnetic flux 
­linkage λ. With the unit of ϕn being a weber (Wb), the 
unit of magnetic flux linkage is the weber-turn (Wb-T).
For two turns of thin wire that are closely packed (Figure 
7.13b), the same magnetic flux may be assumed to pass 
through each turn, and in the same direction, so that ϕn is 
the same for each turn. The flux linkage of the two turns 
is ϕn multiplied by ‘2’ for two turns, that is, λ = ϕn × 2. In 
effect, having two turns doubles the area through which 
flux passes, which doubles the flux linkage.
In the case of a coil of one or more turns, the relative 
directions of current in the coil and magnetic flux in the 
coil can be determined by the right-hand rule, which in 
this case can be alternatively expressed as follows: wrap 
the fingers of the right hand around the coil, with the 
fingers pointing in the direction of current in the turns of 
the coil. The extended thumb will point in the direction 
of flux in the coil (Figure 7.13c). Note that the right-hand 
rule of Figure 7.12 can still be applied, but one must be 
careful as to whether the flux whose direction is being 
determined is inside or outside the coil. Thus, current 
in the front part of the coil flows from left to right. If the 
thumb of the right hand points in the direction of this 
current, the fingers will be inside the coil and will point 
upwards, in the direction of flux inside the coil. However, 
the current in the rear part of the coil flows from right to 
left. If the thumb of the right hand points in the direction 
of this current, the fingers will be outside the coil and will 
point downwards, in the direction of flux in the return path 
outside the coil.
The definition of λ can be extended to a coil of N turns. 
However, when the coil is in a medium of small rela-
tive permeability, as in air or other nonmagnetic, or 
weakly magnetic material, not all the flux lines will 
pass through all the turns. Some of the flux lines will 
loop back around some of the turns of the coil without 
passing through all the turns of the coil, as illustrated in 
Figure 7.14a. λ can be formally defined as
	
l
f

j

(7.16)
where ϕnj, the normal component of flux through the jth 
turn, is summed over all the N turns. In other words, 
flux linkage is the total flux through all the turns of the coil in 
the direction normal to the plane of each turn.
A convenient conceptualization is to define an effec-
tive flux ϕeff that passes through every turn of the coil, 
in the direction normal to the plane of each turn, as in 
Figure 7.14b, and which when multiplied by N gives the 
true value of flux linkage as in Equation 7.16. Thus,

(7.18)
In Equation 7.18, λ is time varying and could be posi-
tive or negative. v(t) is the voltage induced in the coil. 
The magnitude symbol is used on both sides of Equation 
7.18 to emphasize that it is the magnitude of  v(t) that is 
given by the equation. The polarity of v(t) is determined 
by Lenz’s law, according to which the polarity of the 
induced voltage is such that it opposes the change in the 
magnetic flux linkage that induces the voltage. Lenz’s 
law will be illustrated in the discussion on induced volt-
age in the following section.
According to Equation 7.18, an alternative unit of 
magnetic flux linkage is the volt-second (Vs), which 
is also used in connection with voltages applied to 
coils. Note that Equation 7.18 makes ϕeff a well-defined 
quantity that can be determined from experimental 
measurements. For if a time-varying voltage is applied 
to a coil, it is possible, from measurement of this volt-
age, the coil current, and the coil resistance, to deter-
mine v across the ideal inductor component of the coil 
(Figure 7.14c). According to Equation 7.18, λ is the inte-
gral of this voltage with respect to time and is the area 
under the curve. ϕeff is then this area divided by the 
number of turns of the coil.
An important case that arises in practice, and which is 
conveniently simple to consider, is that of a coil wound 
around a toroidal core of high permeability (Figure 7.15a). 
The circular shape of the core, which naturally conforms 
to the circular path of the flux in the core, together with 
the high permeability, ensure that the same flux in the core 
passes through every turn of the coil in a direction normal to 
the plane of each turn. ϕeff for the flux in the core is in this 
case the same as the actual flux in the core.
To express Ampere’s circuital law in the case of a 
toroidal core, consider a plane that is normal to the axis 
of the toroid and which cuts the toroid into two halves, 
one of which is shown in the cross section in Figure 
7.15b. If we follow a path in this plane around a circle of 
radius r inside the toroid and centered on the axis of the 
toroid, we find that the current I in each of the N turns of 
the coil crosses the inside of the circle in the same direc-
tion in all the turns, as illustrated in Figure 7.15b for 
three turns. As the circle is traversed once, the current I 
is enclosed N times, once for each turn of the coil, so that 
Ienc in Equation 7.12 is NI. H is everywhere tangential to 
a given circle of radius r (Figure 7.15b) and is considered 
to have the same value at each point on the circumfer-
ence of the circle. This follows from the fact that the flux 
is the same through any transverse cross section of the 
core that is normal to the tangent to the circle at any 
point on the circumference of this circle. B and hence H 
are therefore the same at any point on the circumference 
of the given circle of radius r. From Equation 7.12,

7.2.3  Inductance
Concept: The fundamental attribute of an inductor is its abil-
ity to store energy in the magnetic field resulting from current 
flow in a conductor.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, an ideal inductor accounts 
for the magnetic energy of the electromagnetic field. The 
circuit parameter associated with this energy storage 
ability is the inductance, defined as follows:
Definition: The inductance of a coil is the flux linkage of the 
coil per unit current in the coil.
According to this definition, the inductance L of a 
­current-carrying coil is
	
L
i
Li
=
=
l
l
or
	
(7.20)
In an ideal inductor, L is a positive constant, so that λ 
and i are linearly related, and there is no power dissipa-
tion. With L positive, λ and i in Equation 7.20 must have 
the same sign, which means that a positive direction for 
λ should be associated with the positive direction for i. If 
i has a negative value, λ also has a negative value. This is 
analogous to the relation between q and v for a capacitor.
If the coil is in air or in a low-permeability medium, 
the effective flux can be used in the expression for flux 
linkage, as in Equation 7.18, to give

(7.21)
A simple expression for the inductance of the coil in 
Figure 7.15 can be readily derived, based on two simpli-
fying assumptions: (1) that the current-carrying wire is 
tightly wound around the core and that the wire diam-
eter and thickness of insulation around the wire are 
sufficiently small so that the flux outside the core is neg-
ligible; in other words, all of the coil flux is confined to 
the core, and (2) that the diameter of the core is small 
compared with the mean diameter, a, of the toroid, so 
that H can be assumed constant across the transverse 
cross section of the core. It follows from Equation 7.19 
that H = NI/πa, independently of r. From Equation 7.14, 
B = μH, where μ = μrμ0 (Equation 7.14). Hence,

Note that inductance is proportional to permeability

because of a definite sign convention associated with 
Equation 7.25, as will be explained shortly. When v is in

As mentioned in connection with Equation 7.6, 
Equation 7.26 is more general than Equation 7.25 in that 
it explicitly involves the initial inductor current at t = 0.
Since L is a positive quantity, a definite sign conven-
tion is implied in writing Equations 7.25 and 7.26 with 
a positive sign on the RHS, in that v must be positive 
when di/dt is positive. It will be argued next that in 
order to satisfy this requirement, the assigned positive 
direction of i and the polarity of v must be such that i is 
in the direction of a voltage drop v, as in Figure 7.16a. 
The justification can be explained with reference to 
Figure 7.16b and will be illustrated by a simulation of 
the circuit, assuming L = 0.4 H and Rsrc = 2 Ω. From KVL,

(7.28)
Let vSRC be a steady voltage of 4 V, initially and up to 
t = 0.5 s (Figure 7.17a). When vSRC has been steady for 
a sufficiently long time, i does not change with time so 
that v = Ldi/dt = 0. It follows from Equation 7.28 that i is 
steady at vSRC/Rsrc = 2 A (Figure 7.17a).
When vSRC increases with time, starting at t = 0.5 s, it 
is to be expected from Figure 7.16b and from Equation 
7.28 that i, the current in the circuit, will also increase 
with vSRC, so that di/dt  >  0. According to Lenz’s law, 
v opposes the increase in i by having a positive value 
that subtracts from vSRC in Equation 7.28, as illustrated 
by the lower trace in Figure 7.17a. With di/dt and v, 
both positive, Equation 7.25 should have a positive 
sign so that L is positive.
On the other hand, if vSRC decreases with time, as 
in Figure 7.17b for t > 0.5 s, i will decrease with time, 
in accordance with Equation 7.28, so that di/dt  <  0. 
To oppose this decrease, in accordance with Lenz’s 
law, the value of v becomes negative, as in the lower 
trace, which adds to vSRC in Equation 7.28 and therefore 
opposes the decrease in i. It is seen that in both cases 
of i increasing or i decreasing with time, assigning i in 
the direction of a voltage drop v across the coil ensures 
that L has a positive value while satisfying Lenz’s law. 
This  justifies having a positive sign on the RHS of 
Equations 7.25 and 7.26.
As mentioned previously, an inductor is an energy 
storage element that can store magnetic energy and 
can deliver the stored energy to the rest of the circuit. 
Having i in the direction of a voltage drop v means that 
power absorbed by the inductor is positive and power 
delivered is negative. To make the power delivered pos-
itive, as is convenient in some cases, the relative direc-
tions of i and v should be reversed, as in Figure 7.18a, in 
which i is in the direction of a voltage rise v. It will be 
shown that in order to have a positive value of L under 
these conditions, the v–i relations for the inductor must 
be written with a negative sign:

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
illustrated by the lower trace in Figure 7.19a. With 
di/dt negative and v positive, the negative sign 
in Equation 7.29 ensures that L is positive. On the 
other hand, if vSRC increases with time, i will increase 
with time, in accordance with Equation 7.32, so 
that di/dt  >  0. To oppose this increase, the value of 
v becomes negative, as in the lower trace in Figure 
7.19b, which subtracts from vSRC in Equation 7.32. The 
negative sign in Equation 7.29 again ensures that L is 
positive. It is seen that in both cases of i increasing or 
i decreasing with time, assigning i in the direction of 
a voltage rise across the coil ensures that L has a posi-
tive value while satisfying Lenz’s law. This justifies 
writing Equations 7.29 and 7.30 with a negative sign 
on the RHS.
In both cases of Figures 7.16 and 7.18, the following 
concept applies:
Concept: If the current through an inductor increases with 
time, this increase is opposed, in accordance with Lenz’s law, 
by an induced voltage in the inductor that is a voltage drop 
in the direction of current. Conversely, if the current through 
an inductor decreases with time, this decrease is opposed by 
an induced voltage in the inductor that is a voltage rise in the 
direction of current.
In the case of both capacitors and inductors, the 
­following sign convention applies, consistent with the 
passive sign convention (Section 1.7):
Sign Convention: If the assigned positive direction of cur-
rent through a capacitor or an inductor is in the direction of 
a voltage drop across the circuit element, the voltage–current 
relations for the capacitor or the inductor are written with 
a positive sign. On the other hand, if the assigned positive 
direction of current through the capacitor or inductor is in 
the direction of a voltage rise across the circuit element, the 
voltage–current relations for the capacitor or the inductor 
are written with a negative sign. The foregoing ensures that 
C and L are positive quantities irrespective of the assign-
ment of the positive direction of current through the circuit 
element and the positive polarity of voltage across the circuit 
element.
7.2.5  Steady Inductor Current
When the inductor current is a steady current ISD, the 
flux linkage in the inductor does not change with time, 
v(t) = LdISD/dt = 0, in accordance with Equation 7.25. 
In  other words, the inductor acts as a short circuit 
when  the inductor current is steady, as illustrated in 
Figure 7.20a.
However, it should be noted that if an ideal steady volt-
age source VSD is applied across the inductor, with no ini-
tial flux in the inductor, it follows from Equation 7.26 that

The inductor current increases linearly with time at a 
rate VSD/L, as illustrated in Figure 7.20b. Conversely, an 
inductor current that increases linearly with time pro-
duces a steady inductor voltage. Thus, it follows from 
Figure 7.20b that if the inductor current is VSDt/L, the 
inductor voltage is v = Ldi/dt = VSD.

7.2.6  Stored Energy
The energy stored in the magnetic field of an inductor 
is equal to the work done in establishing the flux in the 
inductor against the induced voltage, which opposes 
the increase in inductor current during the establish-
ment of the flux. Consider that the assigned direction of 
i through an inductor is that of a voltage drop v across L, 
as in Figure 7.16a. The instantaneous power input to the 
inductor is p = vi. Assuming that the voltage is applied 
at t = 0 with i = 0 and λ = 0 for t < 0, the energy supplied

It should be kept in mind that electric energy in an

and represents potential energy of current carriers with 
respect to an arbitrary zero reference. On the other hand, 
magnetic energy in an electric circuit is represented by 
energy stored in inductors. It is a function of currents 
through these inductors and represents kinetic energy 
of current carriers.

inductor of zero initial flux. Determine as a function of 
time (a) the flux linkage of the inductor, (b) the induc-
tor voltage, (c) the power absorbed by the inductor, 
(d) and the energy absorbed by the inductor. Assume 
the assigned positive directions of Figure 7.16.
Solution:
	 (a)	 The first step is to express the current as a ­function 
of time, as explained in Example 7.1. Thus, 
i(t) = 5t A, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s; i(t) = 5 A, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s; and 
i(t) = −10(t – 2.5) A = 10(2.5 – t), 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s.
From Equation 7.20, λ = Li = 10−6 × i Vs = i μVs. 
It follows that λ(t) = 5t μVs, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s; λ(t) = 5 
μVs, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s; λ(t) = 10(2.5 – t) μVs, 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s; 
and λ(t) = 0, t ≥ 2.5 s (Figure 7.22a).
	 (b)	 v(t)  =  dλ/dt; hence, v(t)  =  5 μVs/s  =  5  μV, 
0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s; v(t) = 0, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s during the time that 
i is steady; v(t) = −10 μV, ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s; and v(t) = 0, 
t ≥ 2.5 s (Figure 7.22b). Note that since λ starts and 
ends with zero, the positive area of the v vs. t graph 
is equal in magnitude to the negative area.
 	 (c)	 p  =  vi; multiplying v and i over the various time 
ranges gives p(t)  =  25t  μW, 0  ≤  t  ≤  1  s; p(t)  =  0, 
1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s; p(t) = −100(2.5 – t), 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s; and 
p(t) = 0, t ≥ 2.5 s (Figure 7.22c). Note that the flux 
linkage of the inductor increases and the inductor 
absorbs power during the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s while v 
and i are positive. No power is absorbed or delivered 
during the interval 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s when v = 0. During the 
interval 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s, i < 0, the flux linkage decreases, 
and the inductor delivers power. At t = 2.5 s, λ = 0.

This means that all the energy absorbed during the 
interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s is returned to the supply during the 
interval 2 ≤ t ≤ 2.5 s. Since energy is the area under 
the power curve, the positive area of the triangle 
extending from t = 0 to t = 1 s, which is 12.5 μJ, must 
be equal in magnitude to the negative area extending 
from t = 2 to t = 2.5 s, which is in fact −12.5 μJ.

t ≥ 2.5 s, w(t) = 0 for t ≥ 2.5 s. The variation of w(t) 
with t is shown in Figure 7.22d. Note that since 
the current returns to zero for t ≥ 2.5 s, w = 0.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as illustrated in 
­Figure 7.23. The inductor is entered from the Analog 
library and has a marked terminal indicating that cur-
rent entering this terminal is considered positive. Zero 
initial condition is entered as explained in Example 7.1. 
In the Simulation Settings, ‘Analysis  type’ is ‘Time 
Domain (Transient)’, ‘Run to time’ is 3s, ‘Start Saving 
Data After’ is 0, and ‘Maximum Step size’ is 0.5m. 
After the simulation is run, then in order to display the 
current and power dissipated to appropriate vertical 
scales, select Trace/Add Trace in the Schematic1 win-
dow and enter 10*V(L1:1),W(L1). The time ­variation 
of inductor voltage and dissipated power is displayed, 
as in Figure 7.24, which is similar to Figure 7.8.
Primal Exercise 7.8
Repeat Example 7.3 assuming the current increases 
­linearly from 0 to 5 A in 0.5 s, stays at 5 A for 1 s, then 
decreases linearly to zero in 1 s.
Ans. 0 < t < 0.5 s: λ(t) = 10t μWb-T, v(t) = 10 μV, p(t) = 
100t μW, w(t) = 50t2 μJ; 0.5 < t < 1.5 s: λ(t) = 5 μWb-T, 
i(t) = 0, p(t) = 0, w(t) = 12.5 μJ; 1.5 < t < 2.5 s: λ(t) = –5t + 
12.5 μWb-T, v(t) = –5 μV, p(t) = 25t – 62.5 μW, w(t) = 
12.5t2 – 62.5t + 78.125 μJ.

Comparing these relations, it is seen that v is multi-
plied by G in the case of a resistor, whereas a function 
of v (its derivative) is multiplied by C in the case of a 
capacitor. This makes the derivations of the equivalent 
series and parallel elements analogous in both cases, 
which results in capacitances combining in series and in 
parallel in the same manner as conductances.

function of time (Figure 7.26c). The area under the iT vs. t 
curve represents the charge that is applied by the source. 
Considering iT as the flow of positive charge, iT adds a pos-
itive charge +q to the left plate of C1 and removes a positive 
charge +q from the left plate of C3, leaving a charge of −q on 
this plate. Through electrostatic charge induction, charge 
is redistributed in the three capacitors so that each capaci-
tor will have a charge of +q on one plate and −q on the 
opposite plate. With no initial charges on the ­capacitors, 
and no external connections to the plates of C1 and C2 that 
are  connected together, nor to the plates  of C2 and  C3 
that are connected together, the charges on the plates that 
are connected together add to zero, before and after iT is 
applied. This is in accordance with conservation of charge.

­conservation of energy.
Although derived for the case of three capacitors, the 
preceding results can be generalized to any number of 
initially uncharged capacitors in series. In particular, if n 
identical capacitors, each of capacitance C, are connected 
in series, Ceqs = C/n and the voltage across each capacitor 
is vT/n. Moreover, Ceqs is smaller than the smallest of the

Summary: In a series connection of initially uncharged 
capacitors, (i) the reciprocal of the equivalent series capaci-
tance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capaci-
tances, (ii) voltages divide inversely as the capacitances, and 
(iii) the charges on each of the capacitors and on the equivalent 
series capacitor are equal.
In a parallel connection of initially uncharged capacitors, (i) 
the equivalent parallel capacitance is the sum of the individual 
capacitances, (ii) currents divide directly as the capacitances, 
and (iii) the charge on the equivalent parallel capacitance is 
the sum of the charges on the paralleled capacitances.
In both the series and parallel connections, the energy in 
the equivalent capacitor is the sum of the energies in the 
­individual capacitors.

It is seen from Equations 7.63 that voltages across

Since iT is the same for the series-connected inductors, 
and λ = LiT for each inductor, the flux linkage of each 
inductor is proportional to its inductance. Hence, 
each  voltage in Equations 7.61 through 7.63 can be 
replaced by the corresponding flux linkage.
If both sides of Equation 7.60 are multiplied by iT

The flux linkage in the equivalent series inductor is 
therefore the sum of the flux linkages in the individual 
inductors. This follows from the fact that the voltage 
across Leqs is the sum of the voltages across the individ-
ual inductors, so that the time integral of the voltage 
across Leqs, which is the flux linkage in Leqs, is the sum 
of the integrals of the voltages across the individual 
inductors.

each of inductance L, are connected in series, Leqs = nL 
and the voltage v across each inductor is vT/n, where 
vT is the total voltage across the series combination. 
Moreover, Leqs is larger than the largest of the series-­
connected inductances, as in the case of resistances.
7.4.2  Parallel Connection of Initially 
Uncharged Inductors
Consider a parallel connection of 3 inductors across 
which is applied a test voltage vT that is an arbitrary 
function of time (Figure 7.30c). The area under the vT vs. 
t curve represents flux linkage that is established by the 
source. If the test current is iT, it follows from KCL that

The energy stored in Leqp is therefore the sum of the 
energies stored in the individual inductors.
Although derived for the case of three inductors, the 
results of this section can be generalized to any num-
ber of inductors in parallel. In particular, if n identical 
inductors, each of inductance L, are connected in paral-
lel, Leqp = L/n and the current i in each inductor is i = iT/n, 
where iT is the current through the parallel combination. 
Moreover, Leqp is smaller than the smallest of the parallel 
connected inductances, as in the case of resistors.
Summary: In a series connection of initially uncharged induc-
tors, (i) the equivalent series inductance is the sum of the individ-
ual inductances, (ii) voltages divide directly as the inductances, 
and (iii) the flux linkage of the equivalent series inductance is 
the sum of the flux linkages of the individual inductors.
In a parallel connection of initially uncharged inductors, 
(i) the reciprocal of the equivalent parallel inductance is the 
sum of the reciprocals of the individual inductances, (ii) cur-
rents divide inversely as the inductances, and (iii) the flux 
linkages of each of the inductors and of the equivalent parallel 
inductance are equal.
In both the series and parallel connections, the energy 
in the equivalent inductor is the sum of the energies in the 
­individual inductors.

7.5  Duality
Duality in electric circuits is an important and useful 
concept that facilitates circuit analysis in some cases 
and provides a better understanding of the comparative 
behavior of inductive and capacitive circuits.
The basis of duality is the sameness of expressions 
when voltage and current, as well as some circuit 
parameters, are interchanged in v–i relations. Consider 
the two expressions of Ohm’s law and the v–i relations 
of capacitors and inductors:
	
v
Ri
i
Gv
=
=
	
(7.75)
	
v t
L di
dt
i t
C dv
dt
( ) =
( ) =
	
 
(7.76)
The two expressions of Ohm’s law (Equations 7.75) 
are of the same form. If v and i are interchanged in the 
first expression (v  =  Ri), and R is replaced by G, the 
second expression (i = Gv) is obtained. Conversely, if 
i and v are interchanged in the second expression, and 
G is replaced by R, the first expression is obtained. The 
two expressions of Ohm’s law become dual relations if 
the quantities being interchanged also have the same 
numerical values. For example, in the case of a 10 Ω 
resistor carrying a current of 2  A, Ohm’s law, in the 
form v = Ri, is 20 (V) = (10 Ω) × (2 A). Its dual relation, 
in the form i = Gv, is 20 (A) = (10 S) × (2 V). In these rela-
tions, 20 V, 10 Ω, and 2 A in v = Ri are replaced, respec-
tively, by 20 A, 10 S, and 2 V in i = Gv. This expression

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
now refers to a resistor of 10  S conductance, across 
which 2 V are applied.
Similarly, Equations 7.76 are of the same form, and 
one reduces to the other when v and i, as well as L and C, 
are interchanged. If 10 V are applied across a 2 H induc-
tor, the v–i relation is 10 (V) = (2 H) × (di/dt A/s). The 
dual relation is 10 (A) = (2 F) × (dv/dt V/s) and represents 
a 2 F capacitor to which a 10 A current source is applied. 
In these dual relations, di/dt and dv/dt would have the 
same numerical values.
Formally, dual relations can be defined as follows:
Definition: Two v–i relations are duals if one relation reduces 
to the other when the following are interchanged: (i) v and i, 
AND (ii) R and G, as well as L and C. Moreover, the quanti-
ties interchanged should have the same numerical values.
The quantities involved in these interchanges are 
referred to as dual quantities. Thus, v and i are dual cir-
cuit variables, R and G are dual circuit parameters. A 
number of duality relationships are listed in Table 7.1. 
Dual circuit variables are not only the primary circuit 
variables of voltage and current. Thus, for a capacitor, 
q = Cv, whereas for an inductor λ = Li, and the relation 
i = dq/dt is the dual of Faraday’s law, v = dλ/dt. Since 
v is the dual of i and C is the dual of L, then q is the 
dual of λ. Independent voltage sources and indepen-
dent current sources are duals. In the case of depen-
dent sources, duality applies to the controlling variable 
as well. Thus, a CCVS and a VCCS are duals, as are a 
CCCS and a VCVS. KVL, according to which the alge-
braic sum of voltages around a mesh or a loop is zero, is 
the dual of KCL, according to which the algebraic sum 
of currents at a node is zero. It follows that the dual of 
a node is a mesh or a loop. A short circuit and an open 
circuit are duals, since the current in an open circuit is 
zero, whereas the voltage across a short circuit is zero. 
Similarly, a series connection and a parallel connection 
are duals, since in a series connection all the elements 
have the same current, whereas in a parallel connection 
all the elements have the same voltage. Consequently, 
voltage division and current division are duals.
In fact, duality extends to whole circuits as well. Thus,
Definition: Two circuits are duals if the node-voltage equa-
tions of one circuit are the dual relations of the mesh-current 
equations of the other circuit.
Duality can be used to derive a relation from its dual, 
or to check relations by comparing them with their 
duals, or to enhance understanding of the behavior of 
circuits by comparing them with that of their duals. 
Once a circuit is analyzed, its dual circuit is automati-
cally analyzed at the same time.
We have already encountered the following examples 
of duality in the present chapter, as listed in Table 7.2:
	
1.	Bearing in mind that L and C are dual circuit 
parameters, and that the series and parallel 
connections are dual connections (Table 7.1), 
it follows that the series connection of capaci-
tors (Equation 7.40) and the parallel connection 
of inductors (Equation 7.69) are dual relations,

as are the parallel connection of capacitors 
(Equation 7.49) and the series connection of 
inductors (Equation 7.60). That is, these rela-
tions are of the same form, and one can be 
obtained from the other by interchanging L and 
C having the same value.
	
2.	The capacitor current is zero when the capaci-
tor voltage is steady, the capacitor acting like 
an open circuit (Figure 7.4a). From duality, the 
inductor voltage is zero when the inductor cur-
rent is steady, the inductor acting as a short circuit 
(Figure 7.20a). The dual entities that are inter-
changed are voltage and current, inductance and 
capacitance, and open circuit and short circuit.
	
3.	A dc current source ISRC applied to a capaci-
tor produces a voltage (ISRC/C)t (Figure 7.4b). 
From duality, A dc voltage source VSRC applied 
to an inductor produces a current (VSRC/L)t 
(Figure  7.20b). Voltage and current are inter-
changed, as are inductance and capacitance.
	
4.	The voltage variation in Example 7.1 (Figure 7.5) 
and the capacitance value are the same as the 
current variation in Example 7.3 (Figure 7.21) 
and the inductance value. The variations of q 
and i in Example 7.1 (Figure 7.6) are the same 
as the variations of λ and v in Example 7.3 
(Figure  7.22). Voltage and current are inter-
changed, as are charge and flux linkage.
Duality is further illustrated in the problems on 
­capacitor and inductor relations at the end of this chapter.
Example 7.4:  Dual of Loaded Linear-Output

Equation 7.78 is KCL for a circuit consisting of a 12 A 
source in parallel with a source conductance of 0.5 S and 
a load conductance of 5.5 S, as shown in Figure 7.32b. 
From Equation 7.78, VL = 2 V. The following should be 
noted concerning these dual circuits:
	
1.	Each element in the series circuit of Figure 7.32a 
is replaced by its dual circuit element, of the same 
value, in the parallel circuit of Figure 7.32b. Thus, 
the 12 A source is the dual of the 12 V source, the 
0.5 S source conductance is the dual of the 0.5 Ω 
source resistance, and the 5.5 S load conductance 
is the dual of the 5.5 Ω load resistance.
	
2.	The voltage and current values for each of the dual 
circuit elements are interchanged. Thus, for the 
voltage source, the voltage is 12 V and the current 
is 2 A, whereas for the current source, the ­current is 
12 A and the voltage is 2 V. For the source resistance, 
the current is 2 A and the voltage is 0.5 × 2 = 1 V, 
whereas for the source conductance, the voltage is 
2 V and the current is 0.5 × 2 = 1 A. For the load 
resistance, the current is 2  A and the voltage is 
5.5 × 2 = 11 V, whereas for the load conductance, 
the voltage is 2 V and the current is 5.5 × 2 = 11 A.
	
3.	Since voltage and current are interchanged for each 
circuit element, their product remains the same, 
which means that the power delivered or absorbed 
by each circuit element is the same as that deliv-
ered or absorbed by its dual circuit element. Both 
the voltage source and the current source deliver 
12  ×  2  =  24  W. Both the source resistance and 
source conductance dissipate 1 × 2 = 2 W, and both 
the load resistance and load conductance ­dissipate 
11 × 2 = 22 W.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
the circuit elements are different. This is because the 
criterion for source equivalence is that the v–i rela-
tion is the same at the source terminals, whereas in 
the dual circuit, v and i at these terminals are inter-
changed. In both cases, however, the same power 
is delivered to the load.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 7.33. 
After selecting ‘Bias Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in the 
Simulation Settings and running the simulation, press-
ing the pressing the I, V, and W buttons displays the cur-
rents, voltages, and powers, respectively, (Figure 7.33). 
The voltages and currents are duals in both cases. The 
same power of 24 W is delivered by both ideal source ele-
ments, the same power of 2 W is dissipated in the source 
resistances, and the same 22 W of power is delivered to 
the load.
A general procedure for deriving the dual of a planar 
circuit is presented in Appendix 7A. By a planar circuit 
is meant a circuit that can be drawn in two dimensions 
without any obligatory crossover connections. However, 
it is sufficient for our purposes to derive the dual of a 
circuit from duality between series and parallel connec-
tions. This is illustrated by the following example.
Example 7.5:  Dual of Capacitive Voltage Divider
It is required to derive the dual of the circuit of Figure 7.9a 
and to determine its response under dc conditions.
Solution:
The circuit of Figure 7.9a, reproduced in Figure 7.34, con-
sists of a 12 V source in series with two branches that are 
shown encircled by dashed ovals. The dual circuit con-
sists of a 12 A source in parallel with two branches, each 
of which is the dual of the corresponding branch in the 
circuit of Figure 7.34a. The dual of the branch consisting 
of the 4 Ω resistor in parallel with 2 μF is a branch con-
sisting of a 4 S resistor in series with a 2 μH inductor, as 
illustrated in Figure 7.34. Similarly, the dual of the branch 
consisting of 8 Ω in parallel with a series combination of 
2 μF and 6 Ω is a branch consisting of 8 S in series with 
a parallel combination of 6 S and 1 μH (Figure 7.34). The 
circuit becomes as shown in Figure 7.35a.
Under dc conditions, the inductors act as short circuits 
(Figure 7.35b). The 12 A current divides into 4 A in the 4 S 
resistor and 8 A in the 8 S resistor in accordance with cur-
rent division between conductances (Equations 3.19 and 
3.20). The voltage across each of these resistors, as well as 
the current source, is 4 A/4 S = 8 A/8 S = 1 V.
Duality between the two circuits is exemplified by 
the fact that the voltage and current values for each of 
the dual circuit elements are interchanged. This is sum-
marized in Table 7.3. The first column lists all the corre-
sponding dual elements in the two circuits. The second 
and third columns list the voltages and currents in the 
capacitive circuit, as shown in Figure 7.9b, whereas the 
last two columns list the currents and voltages in the 
inductive circuit of Figure 7.35b. For example, the 12 V 
source in the capacitive circuit has a voltage of 12 V and 
a current of 1 A. The dual 12 A source in the inductive 
circuit has a current of 12 A and a voltage of 1 V. The 4 Ω 
resistor in the capacitive circuit has a voltage of 4 V and 
a current of 1 A. Its 4 S dual in the inductive circuit has a 
current of 4 A and a voltage of 1 V. The 1 μF capacitor in 
the capacitive circuit acts as an open circuit (I = 0) with 
8 V across it. Its 1 μH dual in the inductive circuit acts as 
a short circuit (V = 0) with 8 A through it, similarly for 
the other elements.

inductor) is written with a positive sign. On the 
other hand, if the assigned positive directions are 
such that the current through the capacitor (or 
inductor) is in the direction of a voltage rise across 
the capacitor (or inductor), the voltage–current 
relation for the capacitor (or inductor) is written 
with a negative sign. The foregoing ensures that 
C (or L) is a positive quantity irrespective of the 
assignment of the positive direction of capacitor 
(or inductor) current and the positive polarity of 
capacitor (or inductor) voltage.
•	 A capacitor acts as an open circuit when the 
voltage across the capacitor is steady, whereas 
an inductor acts as a short circuit when the 
inductor current is steady.
•	 The energy stored in a capacitor can be expressed 
as ½qv, or ½Cv2, or ½q2/C.
•	 Magnetic field strength H is directly related to 
current by ampere’s circuital law, 
H dl

, 
independently of the magnetic properties of 
the medium surrounding the current-carrying 
conductor. Magnetic flux density B is directly 
related to voltage by Faraday’s law, inde-
pendently of the magnetic properties of the 
medium. B and H are related by the permeabil-
ity of the medium: B = μrμ0H.
•	 The magnetic flux linkage λ of a coil is the sum, 
over all the turns of the coil, of the magnetic flux 
through each turn in the direction normal to the 
plane of the turn.
	
1.	 When the same flux does not link all the 
turns of a coil, an effective flux can be 
defined that if multiplied by the number of 
turns gives the true flux linkage of the coil.
	
2.	 In a toroidal core of high permeability, the 
same flux in the core passes through every 
turn of the coil in a direction normal to the 
plane of each turn.
•	 Faraday’s 
law 
may 
be 
expressed 
as 
|v| = |dλ/dt|, where |v| is the magnitude of 
the voltage induced by the time-varying flux 
linkage λ. The polarity of v is determined by 
Lenz’s law, according to which the polarity of 
the induced voltage is such that it opposes the 
change in the magnetic flux linkage that induces 
the voltage.
•	 The fundamental attribute of an inductor is 
its ability to store energy in the magnetic field 
resulting from current flow in a conductor.
•	 The inductance of a coil is the flux linkage of the 
coil per unit current in the coil.
•	 If the current through an inductor increases with 
time, this increase is opposed, in accordance 
with Lenz’s law, by an induced voltage in the 
inductor that is a voltage drop in the direction 
of current. Conversely, if the current through an 
inductor decreases with time, this decrease is 
opposed by an induced voltage in the inductor 
that is a voltage rise in the direction of current.
•	 In a series connection of initially uncharged 
capacitors, (1) the reciprocal of the equivalent 
series capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals 
of the individual capacitances, (2) voltages 
divide inversely as the capacitances, and (3) 
the charges on each of the capacitors and on the 
equivalent series capacitor are equal.
•	 In a parallel connection of initially uncharged 
capacitors, (1) the equivalent parallel capaci-
tance is the sum of the individual capacitances, 
(2) currents divide directly as the capacitances, 
and (3) the charge on the equivalent parallel 
capacitance is the sum of the charges on the par-
alleled capacitances.
•	 In both the series and parallel connections, the 
energy in the equivalent capacitor is the sum of 
the energies in the individual capacitors.
•	 In a series connection of initially uncharged 
inductors, (1) the equivalent series induc-
tance is the sum of the individual inductances, 
(2) voltages divide directly as the inductances, 
and (3) the flux linkage of the equivalent series 
inductance is the sum of the flux linkages of the 
individual inductors.
•	 In a parallel connection of initially uncharged 
inductors, (1) the reciprocal of the equivalent 
parallel inductance is the sum of the recipro-
cals of the individual inductances, (2) currents 
divide inversely as the inductances, and (3) the 
flux linkages of each of the inductors and of the 
equivalent parallel inductance are equal.
•	 In both the series and parallel connections, the 
energy in the equivalent inductor is the sum of 
the energies in the individual inductors.
•	 Two v–i relations are duals if one relation reduces 
to the other when the following are interchanged: 
(1) v and i, AND (2) R and G, as well as L and C. 
Moreover, the quantities being interchanged 
should have the same numerical values.
•	 Two circuits are duals if the node-voltage 
­equations of one circuit are the dual relations of 
the mesh-current equations of the other circuit.

Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Under steady dc or steady conditions, a capaci-
tor is replaced by an open circuit and an induc-
tor by a short circuit
Appendix 7A: Derivation of the Dual  
of a Planar Circuit
The procedure is based on the mesh-current equations 
in the given circuit being the dual relations of the node-
voltage equations of the dual circuit to be derived. 
However, instead of writing the mesh-current and 
node-voltage equations, a graphical procedure can be 
followed. This procedure will be described using the 
circuit of Figure 7.38. It involves the following steps, 
illustrated in Figure 7.39:
	
1.	Inside each mesh, place a node of the same num-
ber as the mesh and place a node outside the 
circuit (node 4 in Figure 7.39). This node is iden-
tified as the reference node in the dual circuit. 
For convenience, this node can have multiple 
representations outside the circuit, all of these 
being connected together and considered to be 
the same node.
	
2.	The nodes are connected together by crossing 
all elements in the circuit. Whenever an ele-
ment is crossed by a connection, the dual circuit 
element is placed in that connection. Consider 
node 2 for example. This node is connected to 
the reference node by crossing the 1 Ω resistor 
and the 3 H inductor. The dual of 1 Ω resistor, 
which is 1 S resistor, is placed in the first connec-
tion, and the dual of the 3 H inductor, which is a 
3 F capacitor, is placed in the second connection. 
Node 2 is also connected to node 1 by crossing 
the 2 Ω resistor and placing its dual, a 2 S resis-
tor in this connection. Node 2 is also connected 
to node 3 by crossing the 2 F capacitor and plac-
ing its dual, a 2 H inductor in this connection.
	
3.	If a voltage source introduces a voltage rise in 
a given mesh when traversed in the clockwise 
direction of the mesh current, the direction of 
the dual current source is that of current enter-
ing the corresponding node. Conversely, if the 
voltage source introduces a voltage drop in a 
given mesh when traversed in the clockwise 
direction of the mesh current, the direction of 
the dual current source is that of current leav-
ing the corresponding node. Thus, the 5  V 
source in mesh 1 in Figure 7.38 introduces volt-
age rise in mesh 1 in the direction of i1. Its dual, 
a 5 A source, causes current to enter node 1 in 
Figure 7.39.
	
4.	If a current source is in the direction of a mesh 
current, its dual voltage source will make the 
voltage of the node having the same number

as the mesh more positive, and conversely. 
In Figure 7.38, the direction of the 3 A source 
is opposite that of i3. Its dual is a 3  V source 
between node 3 and the reference node, and 
having a polarity that will make the voltage of 
node 3 negative with respect to that of the refer-
ence node.
	
5.	Dependent sources are treated in the same man-
ner as independent sources, the controlling 
variables being duals.
	
6.	After deriving the dual circuit, this circuit can be 
redrawn for clarity, as illustrated in Figure 7.40.

Objective and Overview
The chapter introduces phasor analysis, a powerful and 
very useful methodology that extends to the sinusoidal 
steady state all the concepts, theorems, and procedures 
applied to resistive circuits under dc conditions. The key 
underlying concept is the transformation of linear dif-
ferential equations describing the behavior of circuits 
involving capacitors and inductors under steady-state 
sinusoidal conditions to algebraic equations involving 
the imaginary unit j. Appendix D provides an introduc-
tion to complex quantities.
The chapter begins with highlighting some fun-
damental properties of the sinusoidal function and 
responses to sinusoidal excitation, followed by a discus-
sion of phasors and their properties. The v–i phasor rela-
tions for resistors, capacitors, and inductors are derived, 
leading to the concept of impedance. The representation 
of circuits in the frequency domain is then considered, 
including several illustrative examples. The chapter 
ends with a discussion of phasor diagrams.
8.1  The Sinusoidal Function
A voltage or a current that varies sinusoidally with time 
can be represented as
	
y t
Y
t
m
( ) =
+
(
)
cos w
q 	
(8.1)
where
Ym is the amplitude of the sinusoidal function
ω is its angular frequency in rad/s
θ is its phase angle (Figure 8.1)
Note that the argument (ωt + θ) of a trigonometric func-
tion is in radians, which is dimensionless, as is ωt, but it 
is customary to express θ in degrees.
The time interval between successive repetitions of 
the same full range of values of y is the period T. The 
period is conveniently taken as the interval between suc-
cessive maxima, or successive minima, or every other 
zero crossing, as illustrated in Figure 8.1 for successive 
zero crossings from positive to negative values of y(t). 
The full range of values of the function over a period is 
a cycle. The frequency f of repetitions of the function is
	
f
T
=
=
1
2
w
p 	
(8.2)
where
T is in seconds
f is in cycles per second, or hertz (Hz)
ω is in rad/s
Voltages and currents that vary sinusoidally with time 
are designated in circuit analysis as ac quantities, where 
ac stands for ‘alternating current’.
As ω decreases, T increases (Equation 8.2), the sinusoid 
becoming “flatter.” If ω = 0, the sinusoid of Figure 8.1 
becomes a dc quantity of magnitude Ymcosθ.
The sinusoidal function is a periodic function, that is, 
a function consisting of cycles that repeat at a given fre-
quency. However, it is the only periodic function that 
is composed of a single frequency. All other periodic 
functions are composed of more than one frequency, in 
accordance with Fourier’s theorem (Chapter 16).
An important property of the sinusoidal function is 
embodied in the following concept:
Concept: When a sinusoidal excitation is applied to an 
LTI circuit, all the steady-state currents and voltages in 
the circuit are sinusoidal functions of the same frequency as 
the excitation, but which generally differ in amplitude and 
phase angle.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The reason for this is that voltages and currents in an LTI 
circuit are subject to linear operations such as (1) scaling 
or multiplication by a constant, as in Ohm’s law, volt-
age or current division, (2) addition or subtraction, as 
in KCL or KVL, and (3) differentiation and integration, 
as in the v–i relations of inductors and capacitors. When 
sinusoidal functions are subjected to any of these lin-
ear operations, they remain sinusoidal functions of the 
same frequency. The amplitudes and phase angles of the 
resulting sinusoidal functions will differ from those of 
the original functions, but no new frequencies are pro-
duced. It is assumed in this chapter that if more than a 
single source of excitation is applied to a given circuit, 
all the sources have the same frequency. Excitation by 
sources of more than one frequency is considered in 
Chapter 16.
Another important property of the sinusoidal 
­function, which is used in this chapter, is embodied in 
Euler's formula:

where
j =
-1 is the imaginary unit
Ym is the amplitude of the sinusoidal function
Y e
m
j t
w  is a complex quantity, whose real component 
is Ymcosωt and whose imaginary component 
is jYmsinωt. The term Ymsinωt, without j, is the 
­imaginary part. The real part and the real compo-
nent are one and the same.
Equation 8.3 can be plotted in the complex plane or 
Argand diagram, where the real part is plotted along the 
horizontal, or real, axis, and the imaginary part is plotted 
along the vertical, or imaginary, axis (Figure 8.2). Y e
m
j t
w  
is plotted in polar form, as a position vector OP, that is a 
vector drawn from the origin, whose magnitude is Ym 
and whose angle with respect to the positive horizontal 
axis is ωt. This angle increases with time, so that the vec-
tor OP rotates counterclockwise (CCW) about the ori-
gin at an angular frequency ω rad/s. In rectangular form, 
Ymcosωt is the projection of Y e
m
j t
w  on the real axis, and 
Ymsinωt is its projection on the imaginary axis. As time 
progresses, the lengths of these projections vary sinusoi-
dally with time, as illustrated by the dashed extensions in 
Figure 8.2. As a vector, OP =

Analysis of the sinusoidal steady state is the deri-
vation of the currents and voltages in a circuit after a 
sinusoidal excitation has been applied for a sufficiently 
long time. When any periodic excitation is suddenly 
applied to a circuit, there is generally an initial “tran-
sient,” or temporary, response that dies out with time, 
as explained in later chapters. After this transient dies 
out, a steady state remains, in which the currents and 
voltages repeat according to some pattern that depends 
on the time variation of the excitation.
Analysis of the sinusoidal steady state is of funda-
mental importance for the following reasons:
	
1.	The sinusoidal steady state is used in several 
practical cases, as in the frequency responses 
of systems (Chapter 14) and in power system 
analysis (Chapters 17 and 25). Electric power is 
efficiently generated, transmitted, and distrib-
uted as sinusoidal voltages and currents.
	
2.	The methodology used in steady-state sinusoi-
dal analysis is based on expressing sinusoidal 
voltages and currents as phasors and the v–i rela-
tions in terms of impedance. This is extremely 
convenient in that it extends to the sinusoidal 
steady state all the concepts, theorems, and pro-
cedures that apply to resistive circuits under dc 
conditions.
	
3.	The representation of sinusoidal voltages and 
currents as phasors and the v–i relations in 
terms of impedance are later applied to the 
analysis of frequency responses of circuits 
(Chapter 14), the responses to periodic inputs 
(Chapter 16), power calculations (Chapter 17), 
three-phase systems (Chapter 25), and the 
Fourier transform (Chapter 22). Moreover, the 
phasor representation can be readily general-
ized to the most powerful method for analyz-
ing linear systems, namely, that of the Laplace 
transform (Chapter 21).

8.2  Responses to Sinusoidal Excitation
8.2.1  Excitation in Trigonometric Form
Consider the circuit of Figure 8.3a in which a current 
source iSRC(t) = Imcosωt A is applied to a series RL cir-
cuit. It is desired to determine the voltage v across 
the series combination. Note that a tilde symbol (~) is 
added to the source to denote a steady-state sinusoidal 
excitation.
From KVL, v = vR + vL, where vR = RiSRC and vL = 
LdiSRC/dt. Substituting for vR and vL,

seen that this procedure for obtaining v is rather com-

A pertinent question, therefore, is how to reduce the 
derivation of voltage in Figure 8.3a to be much like 
that in Figure 8.4. We will outline the two major steps 
involved in achieving this objective, before examining 
these steps and their implications:
	
1.	The first step is to apply the excitation

(8.9)
	
2.	The second step is to set t = 0 in Equation 8.9, 
which makes the exponential term equal to 
unity, as this leads naturally to phasor notation 
and representation in the frequency domain. 
The RHS of Equation 8.9 becomes (R + jωL)Im 
and is of the same form as Equation 8.8 in that 
the voltage is the product of the amplitude of 
current and a complex quantity (R + jωL), that 
is a constant for a given circuit and frequency of

 is the amplitude of v, 
as in Equation 8.7. Equation 8.10 is in fact the 
precursor to phasor notation.
These two steps will be elaborated and justified in the 
following subsections, leading to the objective of apply-
ing “Ohm’s law” to the sinusoidal steady state.
8.2.2  Complex Sinusoidal Excitation
A complex sinusoidal excitation is not physically real-
izable, but is an important mathematical construct that 
can be interpreted in terms of physically realizable trig-
onometric excitations. From Euler's formula,

It is seen from Equation 8.11 that a complex sinusoidal 
excitation is a combination of a real trigonometric excita-
tion, Imcosωt, and an imaginary trigonometric ­excitation 
whose imaginary part is a real trigono­metric excitation 
Imsinωt. If (R + jωL) is expressed in polar coordinates as

It is seen that the real component of v is the same 
as that derived directly from an excitation Imcosωt 
(Equation 8.7). This raises the question as to whether the 
imaginary part of the response in Equation 8.13 is the 
response to an excitation iSRC = Imsinωt. We will show 
that this is indeed the case.
The most direct way of doing this is to express 
Imsinωt as Imcos(ωt – 90°). This replaces ωt by (ωt − 90°) 
in Equations 8.5 through 8.7. Equation 8.7 becomes

(8.14)
Multiplying Imsinωt by the constant j, as in Equation 
8.11 multiplies the response in Equation 8.14 by j, which 
gives the imaginary component of v in Equation 8.13.
What we have shown, therefore, is that applying the 
excitation I e
m
j t
w  is equivalent to applying the two exci-
tations Imcosωt and Imsinωt at the same time, but with 
each of these excitations being independent of the other, 
as if it were applied alone. This underlies an important 
concept, namely,
Concept: When a complex sinusoidal excitation Ymejωt is 
applied to an LTI circuit, the response is a complex sinusoi-
dal function whose real part is the response to the real part of 
the excitation, Ymcosωt, applied alone, and whose imaginary 
part is the response to the imaginary part of the excitation, 
Ymsinωt, applied alone.
This is illustrated in Figure 8.5, where the excitation 
Vmejωt applied to an LTI circuit is the sum of two exci-
tations Vmcosωt and jVmsinωt. Any voltage or current 
response in the circuit due to Vmejωt is, by superposi-
tion, the sum of two responses: (1) the response due to 
a source equal to the real part of the excitation, Vmcosωt 
acting alone, with the source jVmsinωt set to zero and (2) 
the response due to a source equal to the imaginary part 
of the excitation, jVmsinωt acting alone, with the source 
Vmcosωt set to zero.
The reason for this separation of the responses is that 
in linear operations, the real and imaginary parts of a 
complex quantity do not mix; they retain their respec-
tive identities. Thus, if x = (a + jb) and y = (c + jd), then 
x + y = (a + b) + j(c + d), where the real part of (x + y) is the 
sum of the two real parts (a + b), and the imaginary part 
is the sum of the two imaginary parts (c + d). The same 
is true of other linear operations that are encountered 
in electric circuits, such as differentiation or integration. 
On the other hand, multiplying x and y, which is a non-
linear operation, gives xy = (ab – cd) + j(bc + ad), where 
the real and imaginary parts of xy are mixtures of the 
real and imaginary parts of x and y.
It follows that if the response to an excitation Kcosωt 
or Ksinωt is required, a complex sinusoidal excitation 
Ke j t
w  can be applied and the real and imaginary parts of 
the response will be the responses to Kcosωt and Ksinωt,

respectively. This is summarized in Table 8.1, where the

rotate CCW at an angular speed ω, retaining the phase 
angle θ between them as they rotate. The angular fre-
quency ω is the same because, as emphasized earlier, all 
the voltages and current responses in an LTI circuit have 
the same frequency as the excitation. The information 
of interest in Figure 8.6a is the magnitudes of the two 
vectors and their relative phase angle. It follows that 
no significant information is lost by freezing the rota-
tion of the vectors at a particular value of t or taking a 
snapshot of the rotating vectors at a time t, which can be 
conveniently taken as t = 0. I e

Definition: A phasor is a quantity such as Vmejθ represent-
ing a complex sinusoidal function of time, but with the time 
variation suppressed.

(8.15)
It should be emphasized that phasors drawn on a 
given Argand diagram are implicitly complex sinusoi-
dal functions of time rotating at the same angular fre-
quency. Phasors that are implicitly rotating at different 
frequencies cannot, and should not, be drawn on the 
same Argand diagram. Nor should complex quantities, 
such as (R + jωL), be drawn on the same Argand dia-
gram as phasors (Figure 8.6c).
8.3.2  Properties of Phasors
Being position vectors, phasors have magnitude and 
direction, just like vectors, but with the additional prop-
erty that their horizontal component is a real quantity, 
and their vertical component is an imaginary quantity. 
They can therefore be scaled, added, and subtracted like 
vectors.
Thus, multiplying a phasor by a real quantity K mul-
tiplies its magnitude by K, without changing its phase 
angle. Two phasors Y1

added by drawing Y2 such that its origin lies at the 
tip of Y1 (Figure 8.7a). The sum Y1 + Y2 is the phasor 
whose origin is that of Y1 and whose tip is that of Y2. 
The sum of Y1 and Y2 may be also obtained by apply-
ing the “parallelogram rule”, as in Figure 8.7a. The real 
part of Y1 + Y2 is Y1cosθ1 + Y2cosθ2, and its imaginary 
part is Y1sinθ1 + Y2sinθ2. It follows that the magnitude 
of Y1 + Y2 is

The phasor difference Y1 − Y2 is obtained by adding 
Y1 and –Y2, where –Y2 is a phasor of the same magni-
tude as Y2 but having a phase angle (θ2 + π) (Figure 8.7b). 
Alternatively, the phasor Y1 − Y2 may be obtained as the 
phasor whose origin lies at the tip of Y2 and whose tip 
lies at the tip of Y1. Then Y1 = Y2 + (Y1 – Y2). The pha-
sor can be translated to the origin, without changing 
its magnitude and direction, so as to become a position 
­vector. A phasor Y =

. The phase angle of Y is 
(θ1 − θ2) = tan−1(b/a) − tan−1(d/c), that is, the phase angle 
of Y is the phase angle of the numerator minus that of 
the denominator. The following should be noted:
	 (a)	 Whereas the magnitude of Y is the magnitude of 
the numerator divided by that of the denominator, 
the real part of Y is not the real part of the numera-
tor divided by that of the denominator. Nor is 
the imaginary part of Y the imaginary part of the 
numerator divided by that of the denominator.
	 (b)	 In determining the phase angle from the real and 
imaginary parts, the actual signs of these parts 
must be retained without change, as illustrated 
in Figure 8.10. Otherwise, the angle will be incor-
rect. Thus, assuming a and b are positive con-
stants, tan−1(b/a) is an angle θ in the first quadrant. 
However, tan−1(−b/−a) is the ratio of two negative 
components, −b and −a, so that the angle is (π + θ) in 
the third quadrant. Similarly, tan−1(−b/a) is an angle 
−θ in the fourth quadrant, whereas tan−1(b/−a) is an 
angle (π − θ) in the second quadrant.

According to the interpretation of complex sinusoi-

age RImsinωt V. The voltage and current are in phase 
(Figure 8.12b).

p, plotted in Figure 8.12b, is never negative because 
a resistor does not deliver power. From Equation 8.23, 
p has an average component P

frequency 2ω. The frequency of p is twice that of v or i 
because p is positive when v and i are both positive and 
both negative.
Formally, the average power P is obtained by integrat-
ing p over a period, which gives the energy dissipated 
over the period, and dividing by the period:

through 8.29 that:
Concept: A current of rms value Irms, or a voltage of rms 
value Vrms, dissipate the same average power in a given resis-
tor as a dc current, or a dc voltage, of the same value. The 
average power dissipated in the sinusoidal steady state is, 
like dc power, a real quantity that is independent of time, fre-
quency, and phase angle.
Using rms values of sinusoidal currents and volt-
ages for power calculations results in expressions of the 
same form as under dc conditions. The rms value is also 
known as the effective value.
It should be emphasized that the rms value of a 
phasor current or voltage is a real number that is 1
2
/
 
of the amplitude of the current or voltage, independently 
of the time, frequency, and phase angle. For example, if 
I = (3 + j4) = 5∠53.1° A, so that i(t) = 5cos(ωt + 53.1°)

where K is the constant of integration that shifts the 
voltage in the vertical direction and defines its average 
value. When a purely sinusoidal current of zero average 
is applied to an uncharged capacitor, no net charge is 
deposited on the capacitor over a period, and the result-
ing steady-state voltage is sinusoidal, of zero average, 
so that K = 0.

(Figure 8.13a). The magnitude of V is (1/ωC) times that 
of I, and the phase angle of V is −90°, when the phase 
angle of I is zero (Figure 8.13a).
According to the interpretation of complex sinusoi-
dal excitation, a current Imcosωt A in a capacitor pro-
duces a voltage (Im/ωC) cos(ωt − π/2) = (Im/ωC) sinωt 
across the capacitor, and a current Imsinωt A produces 
a voltage (Im/ωC)sin(ωt − π/2) = −(Im/ωC)cosωt. The 
voltage lags the current by 90°, or the current leads the 
voltage by 90° (Figure 8.13). This can be ascertained 
by comparing the times of occurrence of the positive 
peaks of the waveforms of v and i in Figure 8.13b that 
are closest to one another. Since the peak of v occurs 
later in time than the nearest peak of i by a quarter of a 
period, v lags i by 90°.

The average power P is zero because an ideal capaci-
tor does not dissipate power. The power absorbed (p > 0) 
and stored as electric energy during a positive half-cycle 
of p is equal and opposite to the power delivered (p < 0) 
during a negative half-cycle of p, when the stored energy 
is returned to the supply. p varies at twice the frequency 
of v and i, as in the case of an ideal resistor and for the 
same reason previously mentioned. p is negative when 
either v or i is negative.

The magnitude of V is ωL times that of I, and the 
phase angle of V is 90°, when the phase angle of I is zero 
(Figure 8.14a).
According to the interpretation of complex sinusoi-
dal excitation, a current Imcosωt A in the inductor pro-
duces a voltage ωLImcos(ωt + 90°) = −ωLImsinωt across 
the inductor, and a current Imsinωt A produces a volt-
age ωLImsin(ωt + 90°) = ωLImcosωt. The voltage leads 
the current by 90° or the current lags the voltage by 
90° (Figure 8.13b). This may be ascertained by com-
paring the times of occurrence of the positive peaks 
of the waveforms of v and I that are closest to one 
another. Since the peak of v occurs earlier in time than 
the nearest peak of i by a quarter of a period, v leads 
i by 90°.

The average power P is zero because an ideal inductor 
does not dissipate power. The power absorbed (p > 0) 
and stored as magnetic energy during a positive half-
cycle of p is equal and opposite to the power delivered 
(p < 0) during a negative half-cycle of p, when the stored 
energy is returned to the supply. p varies at twice the 
frequency of v and i, as in the case of an ideal capacitor 
and for the same reason previously mentioned.
From the preceding discussion, the corresponding v–i 
relations of capacitors and inductors in the time domain 
and in ­phasor notation are as follows:

It is seen that the following concept applies:
Concept: In phasor notation, differentiation in time is 
expressed as multiplication by jω, and integration in time 
is expressed as division by jω. Thus, differential and inte-
gral relations are transformed to algebraic relations in jω for 
steady-state sinusoidal analysis only.

Sinusoidal Steady State	
211
This concept in fact underlies the usefulness of phasor 
notation for steady-state sinusoidal analysis.
Another important observation is that v and i are in 
phase for an ideal resistor but are in phase quadrature 
for ideal capacitors and inductors. This is because an 
ideal resistor only dissipates power, which means that v 
and i are in phase. It does not store energy that must be 
returned later to the supply. If no power is delivered by 
an ideal resistor, p is never negative, so that v and i must 
be in phase.
On the other hand, ideal capacitors and inductors 
do not dissipate power, which means that the average 
power P over a period is zero. For this to be the case, v 
and i must be in phase quadrature, which means that if 
one is a cosine function, the other is a sine function, so 
that their product averages to zero over a period.
Concept: The sinusoidal voltage and current for an ideal 
resistor are in phase because such a resistor is purely dissipa-
tive. They are in phase quadrature for ideal energy storage 
elements because these elements are nondissipative.

8.5  Impedance and Reactance
When considering opposition to the flow of current in a 
circuit under sinusoidal steady-state conditions, it is nec-
essary to include, in addition to resistance, the effects of 
energy storage elements. This is because both the build-
up of voltage across a capacitor and the induced voltage 
in an inductor oppose an increase in current through 
these elements by being voltage drops in the direction 
of current, as in the case of a resistor. Consider a part of 
a circuit or subcircuit that does not contain independent 
sources, for reasons that will be explained shortly. Let 
V =
Ð
Vm
v
q  be a voltage phasor across terminals ‘ab’ of 
the subcircuit, and let I =
Ð
Im
iq  be the current through 
the subcircuit in the direction of the voltage drop V 
(Figure 8.15). Then,
Definition: Impedance Z is the ratio of the voltage phasor 
Vm∠θv across a subcircuit to the current phasor Im∠θI flow-
ing through the subcircuit in the direction of a voltage drop. 
The subcircuit could be a single R, L, or C, or a combination of 
these elements. The subcircuit should not contain independent 
sources but could contain dependent sources, as long as the con-
trolling variables of these sources are all within the subcircuit.

where θ = θv − θi (Figure 8.16a). When V is in volts and

plex, it can be expressed as
	
Z

(8.41)
(Figure 8.16b). It should be emphasized that although Z 
is in general complex, it is not a phasor, because it is not 
a complex sinusoidal function of time in which the time 
variation has been suppressed. In fact, the exponential 
time variation cancels out in Equation 8.40. Z is there-
fore drawn on a  separate diagram from that of  V and I. 
Moreover, the reason independent sources are excluded 
from the subcircuit in the definition of impedance is 
that in order to make the concept of impedance useful, 
V

I
–

FIGURE 8.15
Definition of impedance.

212	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
impedance should depend only on the values of the 
passive circuit elements and their configuration, inde-
pendently of any applied excitation due to independent 
sources. Dependent sources can be included, as long as 
their controlling voltages or currents are within the sub-
circuit. The effect of the dependent sources in this case is 
to alter values of R, L, and C.
In the case of an ideal resistor, V and I are in phase 
(Equation 8.22), which means that Z is real and equal 
to R. It follows that R in Equation 8.41 is the usual resis-
tance that we have considered in previous chapters, and 
that for an ideal resistor, X = 0. X, the imaginary part of 
Z is the reactance and its unit is the ohm, just like resis-
tance and impedance.
For an ideal capacitor, Equation 8.31 gives Z = V/I = 
−j/ωC so that X = −1/ωC. For an ideal inductor, Equation 
8.35 gives Z = V/I = jωL, so that X
j L
= w . For both ideal 
energy storage elements, R = 0, since these elements are 
nondissipative. The reactance represents the opposition 
to current flow due to energy storage elements.
It should be emphasized that when X = 0, V and I are 
in phase. When X ≠ 0, Z is complex and V and I are out 
of phase. Hence,
Concept: In a purely resistive circuit, all sinusoidal voltages 
and currents are in phase and their amplitude do not depend 
on frequency. Energy-storage elements possess reactance, 
which causes frequency-dependent phase differences between 
sinusoidal voltages and currents in the circuit and, in addi-
tion, makes the amplitudes of these sinusoidal voltages and 
currents depend on frequency.
The following should be noted concerning reactance:
	
1.	In any expression that involves impedance, 
reactance is always multiplied by j. For an ideal 
capacitor, X = −1/ωC and Z = −j/ωC. For an ideal 
inductor, X = ωL and Z = jωL.
	
2.	Since j appears in the V–I relations as a result 
of differentiating or integrating expressions 
involving ejωt, j is always associated with ω in 
the expression for impedance. Hence, reactance 
is always a function of frequency.
The reciprocal of impedance is the admittance Y:
	
I
V =
=
=
+
1
Z
Y
G
jB
	
(8.42)
where B is the susceptance. B and Y are in siemens, 
like G.
For an ideal resistor, I/V = G = 1/R (Equation 8.15), so 
that B = 0, and G is the usual conductance. For an ideal 
capacitor, Y = I/V = jωC (Equation 8.31), so that G = 0 and 
B = jωC. For an ideal inductor, Y = I/V = 1/jωL = −1/ωL 
(Equation 8.35), so that G = 0, and B = −1/ωL. Table 8.2 
lists the circuit properties of the three circuit elements. It 
is seen that under dc conditions ω = 0, which makes the 
reactance of a capacitor infinite and its susceptance zero. 
This means that when the voltage across the capacitor is 
a dc voltage, the current is zero. The capacitor behaves 
as an open circuit, as argued in Section 7.1. Similarly, 
when ω = 0, the reactance of an inductor is zero and its 
susceptance is infinite. This means that when the induc-
tor current is dc, the voltage across the inductor is zero. 
The inductor behaves as a short circuit, as argued in 
Section 7.2.
Note that whereas G = 1/R for an ideal resistor, 
B  =  −1/X for an ideal capacitor or inductor, and not 
+1/X. This is because conversion from reactance to sus-
ceptance must proceed through impedance and admittance, 
which introduces a minus sign in the reciprocal of the 
imaginary component. Thus, Z = jX, Y = 1/Z = 1/jX = 
−j/X. But Y = jB, so that B = −1/X.
Since V/I = Z = R + jX and R is the resistance, R + jX can 
be interpreted as R in series with jX, as in Figure 8.17a. 
For if the current through the series combination is I, 
then it follows from KVL that V = RI + jXI. Dividing by 
I gives V/I = Z = R + jX. Similarly, I/V = Y = G + jB can 
be interpreted as G in parallel with jB, as in Figure 8.17b. 
For if the voltage across the parallel combination is V, 
then it follows from KCL that I = GV + jBV. Dividing by 
V gives I/V = Y = G + jB.

lags the current through the capacitor by 90° in the time 
domain, and (ii) the magnitude of the reactance of a capac-
itor decreases with frequency because i = Cdv/dt = dq/dt.

It should be noted that if RS and LS are constants, such 
as 50 Ω and 10 mH, RP and LP are frequency dependent. 
They can only be considered constant at a specified fre-
quency. Hence, the paralleled resistor and inductor of 
Figure 8.18b cannot be considered ideal circuit elements 
in this case.
It is instructive to verify some limiting cases:
	
1.	RS = 0, as for an ideal inductor. This makes RP → ∞, 
that is, an open circuit, and LP = LS. The same pure 
inductance appears between terminals ‘ab’ in both 
cases.
	
2.	LS = 0, as for an ideal resistor. This makes LP → ∞, 
that is, an open circuit, and RP = RS. The same pure 
resistance appears between terminals ‘ab’ in both 
cases.
	
3.	ω = 0, that is, dc conditions. Since LS is assumed 
constant, ωLS = 0, which makes RS = RP in Equation 
8.45 and LP → ∞ in Equation 8.46. The resistance 
between terminals 'ab' is the same.
	
4.	ω → ∞, which makes ωLS → ∞ and ZS → ∞. Under 
these conditions, RP → ∞, and LP = LS. However, 
although the inductance is finite, the reactance 
ωLP = ωLS tends to infinity. This makes ZP → ∞, so 
that terminals ‘ab’ are open-circuited in both cases.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Conversion of reactance, or reactance combined 
with resistance, to susceptance, or susceptance 
combined with conductance, must proceed 
through the intermediate, defining step of imped-
ance as the reciprocal of admittance.

Ans. 25 Ω, −j25 Ω.
8.6  Governing Equations
The stated objective of sinusoidal steady-state analysis 
is to emulate dc analysis. In preceding chapters, circuit 
analysis under dc conditions was shown to be based on 
KCL, KVL, and Ohm’s law. In phasor notation for volt-
ages and currents in the sinusoidal steady state, time 
does not explicitly appear in the expressions for volt-
ages and currents, just as in the dc case. This is because 
a steady state is assumed, so that only relative ampli-
tudes and phases are relevant, and these are indepen-
dent of time. Voltages and currents of circuit elements 
are related to impedance and its reciprocal, admittance, 
in the same way as Ohm’s law relates dc voltages and 
currents of resistors to resistance and conductance. It 
remains to show, formally, that KCL and KVL apply in 
phasor notation.
If a current i1 enters a node and currents i2 and i3 leave 
this node, KCL gives at any instant of time:
	
i
i
i
1
2
3
=
+ 	
(8.47)
where i1, i2, and i3 are instantaneous values. If these cur-
rents vary sinusoidally with time, then at any time t, 
Equation 8.47 can be expressed as.

where the amplitudes and phases of the currents are

It is seen that KCL applies to phasor currents. An 
exactly analogous argument shows that KVL too applies 
to phasor voltages.
Since all the concepts, theorems, and procedures 
discussed for the dc case are based on KCL, KVL, and 
Ohm’s law, and since the counterparts of these relations 
are satisfied in the sinusoidal steady state using phasors 
and impedances, the inevitable conclusion is
Concept: All circuit relations, concepts, theorems, and pro-
cedures that apply to resistive circuits under dc conditions 
apply to the sinusoidal steady state, with voltages and cur-
rents represented as phasors and impedances of circuit ele-
ments replacing resistance.
Specifically, this applies to all the circuit equivalence 
relations of Chapter 3, the circuit theorems of Chapter 
4, the circuit simplification procedures of Chapter 5, 
and the circuit equations of Chapter 6. In fact, the dc 
state can be considered as a special case of the sinusoi-
dal steady state with the frequency set to zero, so that 
inductors are replaced by short circuits and capacitors 
by open circuits.
Example 8.3 illustrates voltage and current division 
using impedances.

Simulation: The circuit is entered as in  Figure 8.20. 
For the sinusoidal steady state, source VAC is used 
at a single frequency. A magnitude is entered, and a 
phase, if required, can be set in the Property Editor 
spreadsheet. Note that the value entered for VAC is 
considered by PSpice as an rms value for determining 
power. But for determining voltages or currents, the 
value entered could be interpreted either as a peak 
value or an rms value.
Printers from the SPECIAL library can be used for 
measuring voltages and currents. A current printer 
is inserted in series with one or more circuit elements 
through which the current in question passes. The posi-
tive direction of current is that entering the unmarked 
terminal of the current printer and leaving the termi-
nal marked with a minus sign. A one-terminal voltage 
printer is used for measuring voltages with respect 
to ground, and a two-terminal voltage printer is used 
for measuring voltages between two nodes, neither of 
which is grounded. For AC measurements, a Y must be 
entered under AC in the Property Editor spreadsheet of 
each printer. The printer reading is in rectangular coor-
dinates if a Y is entered under REAL and IMAG, and the 
reading is in polar coordinates if a Y is entered under 
MAG and PHASE.
In the Simulation Settings, ‘AC Sweep/Noise’ is cho-
sen under ‘Analysis type’. For sinusoidal steady-state 
analysis, a single frequency is used. Under AC Sweep 
Type, either ‘Linear’ or ‘Logarithmic’ may be selected. 
The frequency is entered in Hz and is 100 2

in this case. The same frequency is entered for ‘Start 
Frequency’ and ‘End Frequency’, and 1 is entered for 
‘Total Points’. After the simulation is run, the printer

The current printers are identified by their number, 
and the voltage printer by the label of the node to which 
the printer is connected. If the node is not labeled, the 
reference is to the pin number of the node. This number 
can be read by pointing the cursor at the node in the cir-
cuit entered. IM and IP refer to current magnitude and 
current phase; similarly for VM and VP. A value such 
as 4.903E−01 denotes 4.903 × 10−1. It is seen that printer 
values agree with those calculated.
An alternative to using printers for reading val-
ues of currents and voltages is to use the ‘Evaluate 
Measurement’ feature of PSpice. In the SCHEMATIC1 
page, select ‘Trace/Evaluate Measurement’. Two win-
dows are displayed. Under ‘Functions or Macros’ in 
the right-hand window, choose ‘Analog Operators and 
Functions’. To read magnitudes, select the voltage or 
current required from the left-hand window labeled 
’Simulation Output Variables’. To read phase angles, 
select P(), then select the variable required. For exam-
ple, to read the voltage of the node labeled ‘a’, V(a) and 
P(V(a)) are selected. The values 6.20174 and −7.12502 are 
displayed in a window in the SCHEMATIC1 page. To 
read the values of I1, I2, and IL, the variables are −I(V1), 
I(C1), and I(L1), respectively.

8.7  Representation in the Frequency Domain
Let us return to Figure 8.3 that we started with in order 
to illustrate the general procedure for analyzing the 
sinusoidal steady state in the same manner as a dc state. 
The source Imcosωt is converted to a phasor ISRC = Im∠0°, 
and R and L are expressed as impedances, R and jωL, 
respectively, in series with the source. The circuit in terms 
of phasors and impedances or admittances is now said 
to be in the frequency domain, as illustrated in Figure 8.23.

This is an algebraic equation involving the phasors 
and the complex impedance Z = R + jωL. The relation 
V = ZISRC is exactly analogous to Ohm’s law in the dc 
case, bearing in mind that whereas a dc voltage or a dc 
current has only a magnitude and sign, an ac voltage or 
current has an amplitude and phase.

which is identical to Equation 8.7.
The procedure for deriving the sinusoidal steady-
state response can be generalized and summarized as 
follows:
	
1.	The sinusoidal excitations are expressed as phasors. 
A single excitation Ymcos(ωt + θ), or Ymsin(ωt + θ), 
can be expressed as Ym∠θ. In the case of several 
excitations, some of which are cosine functions and 
some are sine functions, they should all be converted 
to either cosine or sine functions before expressing 
them as phasors, taking into account the relative 
phase angles of cosine and sine functions.
	
2.	Inductance and capacitance are expressed as imped-
ance or admittance, as appropriate.
	
3.	The circuit is now in the frequency domain and can 
be analyzed by any of the methods discussed in previ-
ous chapters for the dc case.
	
4.	After obtaining the desired response, this response 
can be converted back to the time domain as a cosine 
function, if the time functions that were originally 
expressed as phasors were cosine functions, or con-
verted as a sine function if the time functions that 
were originally expressed as phasors were sine 
functions.

Example 8.4:  Norton’s Equivalent Circuit 
in Sinusoidal Steady State
It is required to determine Norton’s equivalent circuit 
(NEC) seen by the 20 Ω resistor between terminals ‘ab’ in 
Figure 8.26, assuming vSRC1 = 200sin(5 × 104t) V and vSRC2 = 
100cos(5 × 104t) V.
Solution:
The circuit is first represented in the frequency domain. 
Since one source voltage is a cosine function and the 
other source voltage is a sine function, they should both 
be expressed as sine functions or cosine functions. As a 
cosine function, vSRC1 = 200cos(5 × 104t − 90°) V. As pha-
sors, VSRC1 = 200∠−90° = −j200 V, and VSRC2 = 100∠0° = 
100 V; ω = 5 × 104 rad/s, jωL = j5 × 104 × 0.4 × 10−3 = j20 Ω,

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
(Figure 8.28a), the capacitive reactance is short-­circuited, 
and the current through it is zero. Hence, ISC1  = 
−j200/j20 = −10 A. With VSRC2 applied alone and VSRC1 
replaced by a short circuit (Figure 8.28b), the inductive 
reactance is short-circuited, and the current through it 
is zero. Hence, ISC2 = 100/(−j20) = j5 A. It follows that 
ISC = IN = −10 + j5 = 5(−2 + j) A.
If both sources are replaced by short circuits, the j20 Ω 
and the −j20 Ω appear in parallel across terminals ‘ab’ 
(Figure 8.29a). The 20 Ω resistor is short-circuited, does 
not carry any current, and can be removed. The imped-
ance between terminals ‘ab’ is then ZTh = (j20)(−j20)/
(j20  − j20) → ∞. Alternatively, the admittance of the 
inductor is −j/20 S, and the admittance of the capacitor is 
j/20 S. The admittance YTh between terminals ‘ab’ is zero. 
NEC is an ideal current source 5(−2 + j) A (Figure 8.29b). 
Since ZTh → ∞, TEC does not exist.
Simulation: Unlike the dc case, TEC or NEC cannot be 
obtained in a single simulation because ac quantities 
have both amplitude and phase. The circuit for deter-
mining Norton’s current is entered as in Figure 8.30a. 
Because the current printer has zero resistance, a volt-
age-source-inductor loop is formed that is not allowed 
in PSpice, because the total resistance in the loop under 
dc conditions is zero, and PSpice may be required, in 
general, to derive currents under both dc and ac condi-
tions. This loop can be broken by inserting a 1u resis-
tance as shown, which is too small to affect the result. 
In the Simulation Settings, f = 5 × 104/2π = 7957.75 Hz 
is entered for ‘Start Frequency’ and ‘End Frequency’, 
and a 1 for ‘Total Points’. After the simulation is run, the 
printer readings are as follows:

where the first reading is that of IN in Figure 8.28a. The 
second reading is that of the current of the test voltage 
source in Figure 8.30b that is applied for determining 
YN. IR is the real part of the current and II is the imagi-
nary part. The first reading agrees with the calculated 
value, and the second reading is insignificantly small, 
which is interpreted as zero.

Example 8.6:  Mesh-Current Analysis 
in Sinusoidal Steady State
It is required to determine IO in Figure 8.34a.
Solution:
The circuit is given in the frequency domain. IO will be 
determined by the mesh-current method, the mesh-cur-
rent assignments being as in Figure 8.34b. Because of the 
nontransformable current source in meshes 2 and 3, a volt-
age VY is arbitrarily assigned across this source to allow 
writing the mesh-current equations for these meshes. The 
mesh-current equations are (2 + j2)I1 − 2I2 − j2I3 = j10; −2I1 + 
(2 − j4)I2 = −Vy; and −j2I1 + (4 + j2)I3 = Vy. Adding the last 
two equations to eliminate VY, the resulting equation is 
−(2 + j2)I1 + (2 − j4)I2+ (4 + j2)I3 = 0. The current source gives 
I3 − I2 = 5. From the solution of the equations, I1 = 1.25 + 
j3.75 and I2 = −3.75 − j1.25, so that IO = I1 − I2 = 5 + j5 A.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 8.35. Since 
the reactances are specified in the circuit, but inductance 
and capacitance values have to be entered in PSpice, 
any convenient value of ω can be assumed and L and 
C calculated accordingly. Thus, if ω = 1 rad/s, then L = 
X/ω = 2 H, and C = −1/ωX = 0.25 F, as entered in the 
circuit. In the Simulation Settings, f = 1/2π = 0.159155 
Hz is entered for ‘Start Frequency’ and ‘End Frequency’, 
and 1 for ‘Total Points’. After the simulation is run, the 
printer readings are as follows:

Phasor diagrams showing various voltage and current 
phasors in a given circuit are useful for illustrating the 
interrelations between the various variables involved, 
particularly when some circuit parameter is varied, as 
illustrated by the following example.
Example 8.7:  Phasor Diagram
Given the circuit of Figure 8.36. It is required to deter-
mine: (a) the value of R at which VO is 90° out of phase 
with respect to vI, and (b) how VO changes as R is varied 
from 0 to infinity, assuming that no current is drawn at 
the output.

Solution:
	 (a)	 − j/ωC = −j/(103 × 10−6) = −j kΩ. The lattice configura-
tion of Figure 8.36 can be redrawn as a bridge circuit 
for easier visualization as was done in Example 2.6. 
The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 8.37a in the 
frequency domain, with VI applied between nodes 
‘a’ and ‘c’, and VO taken between nodes ‘b’ and ‘d’. 
VI = Vm∠0°. By voltage division, Vbc = (Vm/2)∠0° 
and Vdc = Vm∠0° × R/(R – j). It follows that.

	 It is seen that |VO| is Vm/2, independently of R. To 
ascertain the correct value of the phase angle, the 
numerator and denominator in Equation 8.56 are 
drawn as position vectors in Figure 8.38. It is seen 
that ∠VO = β, where

	 where θ = tan−1(1/R) and has a positive value that 
is less than 90°. ∠VO is therefore negative, so that 
VO lags VI (Figure 8.40). To have VO 90° out of phase 
with VI, ∠VO = −90°. Substituting in Equation 8.58, 
2θ = −90° + 180° = 90°, so that θ = 45° = tan−1(1/R). 
This gives R = 1 kΩ.

R is in kΩ, and voltages are in volts. The phasor 
Vm∠0° is drawn in Figure 8.40 as OP. The pha-
sor −jI lags the phasor RI by 90°, yet their phasor 
sum must always be Vm∠0°. It follows from the 
geometric properties of a circle that point Q join-
ing these two phasors lies on the perimeter of a 
semicircle of diameter Vm (Figure 8.40). From KVL 
around the path ‘cbdc’ in Figure 8.37, VO = (Vm/2) 
− RI. Hence, if a phasor −RI is drawn in Figure 8.40 
from point T at the tip of the phasor (Vm/2)∠0°, VO 
is the phasor from the origin O to S at the tip of −RI.
When R = 0, phasors RI and −RI are zero, and 
−jI = Vm∠0°. Q coincides with O, and S coin-
cides with T, so that VO = Vm/2, as deduced from 
Figure  8.39a. When R → ∞, I = 0, −jI = 0, and

Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 The sinusoidal function is the only periodic 
function that is composed of a single frequency.
•	 When a sinusoidal excitation is applied to an 
LTI circuit, all the steady-state currents and 
voltages in the circuit are sinusoidal functions of 
the same frequency as the excitation, but which 
generally differ in amplitude and phase angle.
•	 According to Euler's formula, Ymejωt = Ymcosωt + 
Ymsinωt, where Ymejωt is a position vector in the 
complex plane rotating CCW at an angular fre-
quency ω rad/s, and whose projection along 
the real axis is Ymcosωt and along the imaginary 
axis is Ymcosωt.
•	 When a complex sinusoidal excitation Ymejωt 
is applied to an LTI circuit, the response is a 
complex sinusoidal function whose real part is 
the response to the real part of the excitation, 
Ymcosωt, applied alone, and whose imaginary 
part is the response to the imaginary part of the 
excitation, Ymsinωt, applied alone.
•	 A phasor is a quantity such as V e
m
jq representing 
a complex sinusoidal function of time, but with 
the time variation suppressed. Phasors have the 
same geometric properties as vectors but have 
real and imaginary components. They can be 
added and subtracted like vectors.
•	 The product of a phasor Y =
Ð
Y q and a complex 
quantity AÐa is AYe
j q a
+
(
). The quotient of Y and 
A is Y A e
j
/
(
)
-
(

q a .
•	 j in the complex plane has a magnitude of 
unity and a phase angle of π/2. Multiplying 
a phasor by j rotates the phasor through an 
angle π/2 counterclockwise without changing 
its magnitude; dividing a phasor by j, or mul-
tiplying it by −j, rotates the phasor through 
an angle π/2 clockwise without changing its 
magnitude.
•	 In phasor notation, V = RI, V = I/jωC, V = jωLI. 
The sinusoidal voltage and current for an ideal 
resistor are in phase because such a resistor is 
purely dissipative. They are in phase quadra-
ture for ideal energy storage elements because

these elements are nondissipative. I lags V in an 
inductor and leads V in a capacitor.
•	 Differentiation in time is replaced by mul-
tiplication by jω and integration in time is 
replaced by division by jω. Thus, differential 
and integral relations are transformed to alge-
braic relations in jω for steady-state sinusoidal 
analysis only.
•	 The instantaneous power p in resistors, induc-
tors, and capacitors under sinusoidal steady 
state conditions varies at twice the frequency of 
the voltage or current, because p = vi is positive 
when v and i are both positive and both nega-
tive. p is negative when either v or i is negative.
•	 The instantaneous power p is never negative 
for an ideal resistor because such a resistor 
is purely dissipative. In ideal energy storage 
elements, p is of zero average over a period 
because these elements are nondissipative. 
They absorb power from the rest of the circuit 
during the positive half-cycle of p and return 
the same power to the rest of the circuit during 
the negative half-cycle of p.
•	 A current of rms value Irms, or a voltage of rms 
value Vrms, dissipates the same power in a given 
resistor as a dc current, or a dc voltage, of the 
same value.
•	 The average power dissipated in the sinusoidal 
steady state is, like dc power, a real quantity 
that is independent of time.
•	 Impedance Z is the ratio of the voltage phasor 
Vm
v
Ðq  at the terminals of a subcircuit, to the cur-
rent phasor Im
i
Ðq  through the subcircuit in the  
direction of the voltage drop Vm
v
Ðq . The real 
part of impedance is resistance and its imagi-
nary part is reactance.
•	 Reactance is due to energy storage elements. 
Whereas sinusoidal voltages and currents are 
all in phase in a purely resistive circuit, energy 
storage elements introduce phase differences 
between sinusoidal voltages and currents.
•	 All circuit relations, concepts, theorems, and 
procedures that apply to resistive circuits under 
dc conditions apply to the sinusoidal steady 
state, with voltages and currents represented 
as phasors and impedances of circuit elements 
replacing resistance.
•	 The procedure for deriving the sinusoidal 
steady-state response can be summarized as 
follows:
	
1.	 The sinusoidal excitations are expressed as 
phasors. A single excitation Ymcos(ωt + θ), or 
Ymsin(ωt + θ), can be expressed as Ym∠θ. In 
the case of several excitations, some of which 
are cosine functions and some are sine func-
tions, they should all be converted to either 
cosine or sine functions before expressing 
them as phasors.
	
2.	 Inductance and capacitance are expressed as 
impedance or admittance, as appropriate.
	
3.	 The circuit is now in the frequency domain and 
can be analyzed by any of the methods dis-
cussed in previous chapters for the dc case.
	
4.	 After obtaining the desired response, this 
response can be converted back to the time 
domain as a cosine function, if the time 
functions that were originally expressed as 
phasors were cosine functions or converted 
as a sine function if the time functions that 
were originally expressed as phasors were 
sine functions.
•	 Phasor diagrams showing various voltage and 
current phasors in a given circuit are useful for 
illustrating the interrelations between the vari-
ous variables involved, particularly when some 
circuit parameter is varied.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Complex quantities are conveniently added 
or subtracted in rectangular form and are 
­conveniently multiplied or divided in polar 
form.
	
2.	Conversion of reactance, or reactance combined 
with resistance, to susceptance, or susceptance 
combined with conductance, must proceed 
through the intermediate step of impedance as 
the reciprocal of  admittance.
Appendix 8A: ac Bridges
ac bridges can be used in the same manner as the dc 
Wheatstone bridge (Appendix 5A) to determine the 
value of a quantity from a condition of bridge balance, 
with the same advantages previously mentioned for a 
dc bridge.
An example of an ac bridge is the Maxwell L/C 
bridge, depicted in Figure 8.41 in the frequency domain. 
The bridge can be used for measuring the inductance 
and resistance of a coil in terms of known resistance and 
capacitance values. The condition for bridge balance 
can be derived in the same manner as for the dc bridge 
by determining the voltages Vbc and Vdc in terms of VI,

Objective and Overview
This chapter introduces magnetic coupling between 
coils, whereby a time-varying magnetic field of a current-
carrying coil induces a voltage in a nearby coil. Magnetic 
coupling is the basis for transformer action and plays 
an essential role in many types of devices, ­circuits, and 
systems.
The chapter begins with the basics of magnetic cou-
pling, including the dot convention and the definitions 
of mutual inductance and the coupling coefficient. The 
general method for analyzing circuits involving mutual 
inductance is discussed, with emphasis on determining 
the polarity of the induced voltage. The T-equivalent 
circuit is presented, which eliminates the magnetic cou-
pling and which can be used in analyzing most cases 
that are of practical interest.
9.1  Magnetic Coupling
When a current-carrying coil is in proximity to another 
coil, some of the flux due to the current-carrying 
coil links the other coil. If this flux is time varying, it 
induces a voltage in the other coil in accordance with 
Faraday’s law. The two coils are said to be magneti-
cally coupled. This is illustrated in Figure 9.1a for two 
coils in a medium of low permeability and in Figure 
9.1b for two coils wound on a toroidal core of high 
permeability.
Suppose that coil 2 in Figure 9.1a and b is open-­
circuited. The flux linkage of coil 2 due to current in 
coil 1 is denoted by λ21, where the first number in the 
subscript refers to the coil linked by the flux and the 
second number refers to the coil from which the flux 
originates. In the case of coils in a medium of low 
permeability (Figure 9.1a), an effective flux ϕ21eff is 
defined, as discussed in connection with Figure 7.14, 
as the flux in coil 2 due to current in coil 1, which, 
if multiplied by N2, the number of turns in coil 2, 
gives the true value of flux linkage in coil 2. That is, 
λ21 = N2ϕ21eff.
In the case of coils on a high-permeability core 
(Figure  9.1b), and as explained in connection with 
Figure 7.15, ϕ21eff is the same as the flux in the core ϕ21. This 
same flux links every turn of the coil, so that λ21 = N2ϕ21.
In both cases, Faraday’s law can be expressed as
	
v
d
dt
21
21

l
	
(9.1)
where |v21| is the magnitude of the voltage induced in 
coil 2 due to current in coil 1. Thus, λ21 is well defined 
in terms of the time integral of v21.
The polarity of v21 is determined by Lenz’s law, just 
like the polarity of v1 (Section 7.2), and could be deduced 
from the direction of current that flows if a resistor is 
connected between the coil terminals. However, an 
added consideration in this case is the relative sense of 
winding of the two coils, as will be explained with the 
aid of Figure 9.2. Note that the assigned positive polar-
ity of v21 in Figure 9.2 is that of terminal 2 being positive 
with respect to terminal 2′.
In Figure 9.2a, the flux due to i1 is directed down-
ward in coil 1, in accordance with the right-hand rule 
(Figure 7.13), and is directed upward in coil 2. Assume 
that this flux is increasing with time; then according to 
Lenz’s law, the polarity of the voltage induced in coil 2 
is such that if current flows in coil 2 as a result of this 
induced voltage being applied across a resistor con-
nected between terminals 2 and 2′, the flux in coil 2 due 
to this current is downward, so as to oppose the increas-
ing flux in coil 2 due to i1. According to the right-hand 
rule, i2 flows out of terminal 2 of coil 2 so that the flux 
due to i2 is downward (Figure 9.2b). Terminal 2 of coil 2 is 
then positive with respect to terminal 2′ to cause the flow 
of i2 in the required direction. The induced voltage is of

the same polarity as the assigned positive direction of v21 
in Figure 9.2a, so the numerical value of v21 is positive.
Now consider Figure 9.2c, where the sense of winding 
of coil 2 has been reversed, while keeping the same sense 
of winding in coil 1. Thus, in proceeding from terminal 2 
to terminal 2′ in Figure 9.2a, coil 2 is wound in the coun-
terclockwise sense, when looking downward at the coil. 
On the other hand, coil 2 in Figure 9.2c is wound in the 
opposite sense, that is, clockwise, when looking down-
ward at the coil, while proceeding from terminal 2 to 
terminal 2′. In order to have a downward flux in coil 2, i2 
must enter terminal 2. The induced voltage in coil 2 is 
now such that terminal 2′ is positive with respect to ter-
minal 2, as shown in Figure 9.2d, so that the induced 
voltage applied across a resistor connected between ter-
minals 2 and 2′ causes a flow of current in the required 
direction. This is opposite that of the assigned positive 
polarity of v21 in Figure 9.2c, so v21 will now have a nega-
tive numerical value.
9.1.1  Dot Convention
Having to show the sense of winding in a circuit dia-
gram is rather awkward. It is avoided by using the dot 
convention. The basis for this convention can be read-
ily understood with reference to Figure 9.2. Assuming 
that i1 is increasing with time, the polarity of v1 is such 
that terminal 1 is positive with respect to terminal 1′ 
so as to oppose the increase in current, as explained in 
Section 7.2. It was argued in connection with Figure 9.2a 
and b that when the flux linking coil 2 is increasing with 
time, terminal 2 is positive with respect to terminal 2′. 
According to the dot convention, terminals that go positive 
together, or go negative together, on different coils are marked 
with a dot. Thus, in Figure 9.2a and b, terminals 1 and 2 
are marked with a dot as shown, or alternatively, termi-
nals 1′ and 2′ could be so marked.
In Figure 9.2c and d, it was argued that when the flux 
linking coil 2 increases with time, terminal 2′ is positive 
with respect to terminal 2. According to the dot conven-
tion, therefore, terminals 1 and 2′ are marked with a dot 
as shown, or alternatively, terminals 1′ and 2 could be 
so marked.
The dot markings are further illustrated in Figure 9.3a 
and b for two coils coupled through a core of high per-
meability. Assuming i1 increases with time, the polarity 
of v1 is a voltage drop in the direction of i1, as shown. 
In Figure 9.3a, the flux ϕ21 in the core due to i1 is clock-
wise and increases with time. With the sense of wind-
ing of coil 2 as indicated, the induced voltage in coil 2 
makes terminal 2 positive with respect to terminal 2′. 
This is because the current i2 due to this induced voltage 
applied across a resistor connected between terminals 
2 and 2′ leaves at terminal 2, thereby causing a coun-
terclockwise flux ϕ12 that opposes ϕ21. Hence, terminals 
1 and 2 go positive together and are therefore marked 
with dots, as shown.
In Figure 9.3b, the sense of winding of coil 2 is reversed 
compared to coil 1. To have a flux ϕ12 that opposes ϕ21, i2 
flows into terminal 2, which means that the induced volt-
age is such that terminal 2′ is positive with respect to ter-
minal 2, so that if this voltage is applied across a resistor 
connected between terminals 2 and 2′, the resulting cur-
rent is in the required ­direction. Terminals 1 and 2′ now 
go positive together and are therefore marked with dots.
It is seen that once terminals are marked with dots, 
there is no need to show the relative sense of winding

of the coils. Magnetically coupled coils are drawn as in 
Figure 9.3c and d, with one terminal of each coil marked 
with a dot, according to the relative sense of winding. 
The fact that the two coils are magnetically coupled is 
indicated by an arc with two arrowheads at each end 
pointing to the two coils. It should be emphasized that 
there are only two relative senses of winding of the two 
coils, illustrated by the black dots in Figure 9.3c and d. 
The gray dots in each figure indicate the same relative 
sense of winding as the black dots in the same figure. 
Changing the relative sense of winding will henceforth 
be referred to as “reversal of the dot markings” from one 
configuration to the other, as between Figure 9.3c and d.
Although the argument used in Figures 9.2 and 9.3 
concerning dot markings was based on the assumption 
that i1 and its flux increase with time, the same conclu-
sion is reached if these quantities were decreasing with 
time, rather than increasing. Figure 9.4a, for example, has 
the same sense of winding of both coils as in Figure 9.3a. 
If i1 decreases with time, the induced voltage in coil 1 is 
now a voltage rise in the direction of i1, as explained in 
Section 7.2. ϕ21, and the flux linking coil 2 due to current 
in coil 1 is still clockwise around the core but decreases 
with time. According to Lenz’s law, ϕ12, the flux linking 
coil 1 due to current in coil 2 opposes the decrease of ϕ21 
by adding to ϕ21 in the clockwise direction. i2 now enters 
at terminal 2, so that the induced voltage reverses polar-
ity, compared with Figure 9.3a in order to reverse the 
direction of i2. But the coil terminals marked with dots 
now go negative together, so that the dot markings are 
still the same. A similar argument applies to Figure 9.4b 
in which the relative sense of winding is the same as in 
Figure 9.3b.
The current directions in Figure 9.4 provide an alter-
native interpretation of the dot markings, based on 
the directions of currents in the coils, relative to the 
dot markings, as opposed to the polarities of induced 
voltages, relative to the dot markings. This alternative 
interpretation is useful when writing the mesh-current 
equations or KVL involving magnetically coupled coils. 
The argument is as follows: In Figures 9.2 and 9.3, when 
i1 enters at the dot-marked terminal and increases with 
time, which means that ϕ21 also increases with time, i2 
leaves the dot-marked terminal, so that its flux, ϕ12, is in 
a direction that opposes ϕ21. It follows that if i2 enters the 
dot-marked terminal, instead of leaving this terminal, 
then ϕ12 is in the same direction as ϕ21. This is illustrated 
in Figure 9.4 for i1 decreasing with time. However, the 
direction of flux produced by a  current  in a coil is inde-
pendent of whether the current is increasing or decreas-
ing with time. Hence, the dots can also be interpreted 
on the basis that if the currents of the two coils both enter, 
or both leave, the dotted terminals, the fluxes due to these 
­currents are in the same direction in both coils. In summary, 
the dot convention applies as follows:
Dot convention: When the flux linking magnetically 
­coupled coils changes with time, the polarities of the induced 
voltages are the same at the dot-marked terminals of each coil; 
that is, the dot-marked terminals will all become positive, or 
negative, together with respect to the unmarked terminal. 
As a corollary, fluxes due to currents both entering, or both 
leaving, the dot-marked terminals in each coil are in the same 
direction in both coils.

Primal Exercise 9.3
Two coils are wound on a high-permeability toroidal core 
of 2 cm2 cross-sectional area, with coil 2 open-­circuited 
(Figure 9.7). If the magnetic flux density B in the core, in 
the clockwise sense, due to current in coil 1, is decreas-
ing at a constant rate of 0.1 Wb/cm2/s, determine the 
magnitude and sign of v2, assuming coil 2 has 10 turns.
Ans. −2 V.
9.2  Mutual Inductance
Faraday’s law, in the form of Equation 9.1, expresses 
the magnitude of the voltage v21 induced in coil 2 by the 
time-varying flux linkage λ21 in coil 2 due to current in 
coil 1. If the coils are in a medium of low permeability, 
λ21 = N2ϕ21eff. In the case of coils on a core of high perme-
ability, λ21 = N2ϕ21, where ϕ21 is in this case the core flux 
that links both coils. Since λ21 is due to i1, it is desirable 
to express λ21 in terms of i1. This is done by defining a 
quantity M21 as λ21 per unit current in coil 1. Thus,
	
M
i
21

(9.2)
It follows that λ21  =  M21i1. In a linear system, λ21 is 
directly proportional to i1, so M21 is a constant. Faraday’s 
law (Equation 9.1) becomes

If coil 2 carries current, with coil 1 open-circuited, the 
same argument applies. Flux linkage λ12 is established in 
coil 1 due to i2, where λ12 = N1ϕ12eff in the case of coils in a 
medium of low permeability and λ12 = N1ϕ12 in the case 
of coils on a core of high permeability, where ϕ12 in this 
case is the core flux that links both coils. To express λ12 as 
a function of i2, a quantity M12 is defined as λ12 per unit 
current in coil 2:
	
M

M is the mutual inductance between the two coils and 
is a constant in a linear system. It follows from Equations 
9.2 and 9.4 that mutual inductance is defined as follows:
Definition: The mutual inductance of two magnetically cou-
pled coils is the flux linkage in one coil per unit current in the 
other coil. It is independent of which coil carries the current.

That the flux linkage per unit current does not depend 
on which of two magnetically coupled coils carries the 
current is a consequence of M12 and M21 being equal. The 
definition of mutual inductance is seen to be a general-
ization of the definition of the inductance of a single coil, 
this being the flux linkage in the coil per unit current in 
the coil itself. In the case of two magnetically coupled 
coils, the mutual inductance is the flux linkage in one 
coil per unit current in the other coil. To distinguish 
the two types of inductance when both are present, the 
inductance L of a coil associated with current in the coil 
itself is referred to as the self-inductance. Just as L is an 
inherently positive quantity, so is M.
9.2.1  Coupling Coefficient
When two coils are magnetically coupled, not all the 
flux that links one coil links the other coil. This is par-
ticularly true for two coils in a nonmagnetic medium 
(Figure  9.8a). The flux due to i1 in coil 1 extends in 
three dimensions around this coil but only a relatively 
small fraction of this three-dimensional flux links coil 2. 
Only this flux is shown in Figure 9.8a and in its two-­
dimensional representation in Figure 9.8b. In contrast, 
when the coils are coupled through a core of high 
­permeability (Figure 9.9a), practically all the flux origi-
nating from one coil links the other coil.
The flux that links a current-carrying coil, but not 
another coil coupled to it, is the leakage flux of the 
­current-carrying coil. It is seen that the leakage flux 
is relatively large in the case of coupling through a 
medium of low permeability (Figure 9.8a) and is rela-
tively small for coupling through a core of high perme-
ability (Figure 9.9a), where the leakage flux of coil 1 is 
denoted as ϕ11leak. Even if the permeability of the core is 
high, the extent of the leakage flux depends on the geom-
etry of the core and the coils. In the case of a rectangular 
core, for example, a leakage flux can occur between two 
opposite limbs of the core, as illustrated diagrammati-
cally in Figure 9.9b; the lower the relative permeabil-
ity of the core, the more significant is this leakage flux. 
A toroidal core, on the other hand, naturally conforms 
in shape to the flux path, so that this type of leakage 
flux is eliminated. However, flux leakage can still occur 
in the space between the winding and the core, as illus-
trated diagrammatically in Figure 9.9a. It is not possible 
to eliminate this space entirely by tightly winding the 
coil around the core, because of the finite thickness of 
the required insulation around the conducting wire of 
the coil and because of the finite diameter of the wire 
itself. Both of these factors imply that some leakage flux 
inevitably exists outside the core, including flux within 
the conducting wire itself.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
For simplicity, and without loss of generality, the fol-
lowing discussion specifically refers to coils wound on a 
core of high permeability, as in Figure 9.9a. The degree of 
magnetic coupling between the two coils in Figure 9.9a 
is indicated by the coupling coefficient. From superposi-
tion, since the system is assumed to be linear, the total 
flux ϕ11 in coil 1 carrying a current i1 is

where ϕ21 is the flux in coil 2 due to current in coil 1, 
which also links coil 1. When coil 2 does not carry cur-
rent, ϕ21 is the flux in the core (Figure 9.9a). ϕ11eff(leak) is the 
effective leakage flux of coil 1, which when multiplied by 
N1 gives the true value of the flux linkage λ11leak due to the 
leakage flux of coil 1. ϕ11eff(leak) is used because all the leak-
age flux of coil 1 does not, in general, link all the turns 
of coil 1, as diagrammatically illustrated in Figures 9.1a 
and 9.2a.

2  is the coupling coefficient and is a 
measure of how well the two coils are coupled together 
through the core. The first fraction, ϕ21/(ϕ21 + ϕ11eff(leak)), 
is a measure of how well coil 1 is coupled to the core. 
This fraction is zero if there is no coupling (ϕ21 = 0) and 
is unity if the coupling is perfect (ϕ11eff(leak) = 0). Similarly, 
the second fraction is a measure of how well coil 2 is 
coupled to the core. The product of the two fractions, 
k2, is therefore a measure of how well the two coils 
are coupled together through the core. k assumes val-
ues between 0 and 1, where k = 0 denotes no coupling 
between the two coils. This occurs when M = 0, so that 
the core flux ϕ21 or ϕ12 is zero. k = 1 denotes perfect cou-
pling, when neither coil has any leakage flux. The larger 
the value of k, the more “tightly” the coils are said to be 
coupled together.
For given L1 and L2, the largest value of M occurs when 
k = 1, and is L L
1
2 , the geometric mean of L1 and L2. The 
value of M is in this case intermediate between the values 
of L1 and L2. Clearly, k is inherently a positive quantity. 
However, PSpice allows a negative value of k in order to 
reverse the dot markings of the two coils, without chang-
ing their connections, as illustrated in Example 9.1.

Ans. (a) ωMImsinωt; (b) no.
Primal Exercise 9.8
Can the mutual inductance between two magnetically 
coupled coils be equal to the self-inductance of either 
coil?
Ans. If L1 = L2 = L, and k = 1, then M = L. If L1 ≠ L2, M can 
be equal to the smaller of L1 and L2; it cannot be equal to 
the larger of L1 and L2, as this makes k > 1.
9.3  Linear Transformer
Definition: A transformer consists of two or more coils that 
are magnetically coupled relatively tightly. In a linear trans-
former, permeability is constant, so that B and H, or λ and i, 
are linearly related.
The magnetically coupled coils considered in Sections 
9.1 and 9.2 are examples of a linear transformer for 
values of k that are not too small, say, larger than 0.1. 
Linearity implies superposition of all magnetic variables, 
including fluxes.
The general method of analyzing a circuit that includes 
a linear transformer is to apply KVL in the meshes that 
include the magnetically coupled coils. In writing the 
KVL equations, the assignment of positive directions 
of currents in the coils is either arbitrary or is dictated 
by convenience in analyzing the circuit. However, the 
assignment of positive directions of currents affects the 
sign of the Mdi/dt terms that account for the magnetic 
coupling. The question that we will address next is how 
to determine the sign of the Mdi/dt term.
Recall that in Section 7.2, the polarity of the induced 
voltage across a coil was argued from Lenz’s law. 
Figure 7.26b is reproduced in Figure 9.10a, with the vari-
ables and parameters relabeled to conform to the pres-
ent discussion on the two-coil, linear transformer. Note 
that vSRC1 and Rsrc1 can represent, in general, TEC of the 
­circuit connected to coil 1. From KVL,

As for the polarity of v11, it was argued from Lenz’s 
law that if, for the sake of argument, vSRC1 and i1 increase 
with time, v11 opposes the increase in i1 by having a 
positive value that subtracts from vSRC1 in Equation 9.17. 
The coil in Figure 9.10a is shown in Figure 9.10b as coil 
1 of a linear transformer, with coil 2 open-circuited to 
begin with. The flux in the core due to i1 is indicated 
as ϕ21 in the clockwise sense, in accordance with the 
right-hand rule.
Consider next that coil 1 is open-circuited and that coil 
2 is connected to a circuit represented by its TEC consist-
ing of vSRC2 and Rsrc2. If the current i2 in coil 2 enters at 
terminal 2 as shown in Figure 9.10c, it produces a flux 
ϕ12 in the core in the clockwise sense, the same as ϕ21 in 
Figure 9.10b. As ϕ12 changes with time, the magnitude 
of the voltage v12 induced in coil 1 is given by Faraday’s 
law as |v12| = |dλ12/dt|. Using Equation 9.13,

(9.19)
What about the polarity of v12? It is to be expected that 
since ϕ12 in Figure 9.10c is in the same direction as ϕ21 in 
Figure 9.10b, v12 is of the same polarity as v11. According 
to Lenz’s law, an increase in the flux in the core in the 
clockwise direction, whether due to an increase in ϕ21 
or an increase in ϕ12, results in an induced voltage of 
the same polarity. In other words, the polarity of the 

244	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
voltage induced in coil 1 depends on whether the flux in 
the core is increasing or decreasing in the same direction 
in the core, irrespective of whether this flux is due to i1 
or i2. This can be ascertained by imagining a resistor con-
nected across coil 1, as in Figure 9.10d. If ϕ12 is increas-
ing, a current i1 will flow out of terminal 1, producing a 
flux in the core in the counterclockwise sense, as shown 
in Figure 9.10d, in opposition to ϕ12. For i1 to flow out of 
terminal 1, v12 should have the same ­polarity as v11.
If both i1 and i2 are present at the same time, superpo-
sition applies. The total flux in the core is (ϕ21 + ϕ12). The 
total induced voltage in coil 1 is (L1di1/dt  +  Mdi2/dt), 
where the sign of the Mdi2/dt term is the same as that 
of the L1di1/dt, since v12 is of the same polarity as v11, 
as argued in the preceding paragraph. KVL for the 
mesh that includes the source and coil 1 (Equation 9.16)

If the assigned positive direction of i2 is reversed 
(Figure 9.11a), the direction of ϕ12 reverses, becom-
ing counterclockwise. If, for the sake of argument, 
ϕ12 increases with time, then according to Lenz’s law, 
v12 reverses polarity (Figure  9.11b), so that if i1 flows 
due to v12, it will produce a flux in the core in the clock-
wise sense so as to oppose the increase in ϕ12. If both 
i1 and i2 are present at the same time, superposition 
applies. The total flux in the core is now (ϕ21 − ϕ12). The 
total induced voltage in coil 1 is (L1di1/dt − Mdi2/dt), 
where the sign of the Mdi2/dt term is now opposite that 
of the L1di1/dt, since the polarity of v12 is opposite that of 
v11. KVL for the mesh that includes the source and coil 1 
(Equation 9.16) becomes

Suppose, next, that the sense of winding of coil 2 is 
reversed, so that the dot marking on this coil is reversed 
(Figure 9.11c), while keeping the same assigned ­positive 
direction of i2 as in Figure 9.11a. ϕ12 is in the clockwise 
sense, as in Figure 9.10c, and the same argument applies. 
If both i1 and i2 are present, ϕ12 adds to ϕ21, so that 
Equation 9.20 applies. If the assigned positive direction 
of i2 is reversed, while keeping the same dot markings as 
in Figure 9.11c, ϕ12 is now counterclockwise, opposing 
ϕ21 so that Equation 9.21 applies.
The foregoing is summarized by noting that if the 
assigned positive directions of i1 and i2 and the dot 
markings are such that the fluxes in the core due to i1 and i2 
are additive, the sign of the Mdi2/dt term is the same as that 
of the L1di1/dt term (Equation 9.20). On the other hand, if 
the assigned positive directions of i1 and i2 and the dot 
markings are such that the fluxes in the core due to i1 and i2 
are in opposition, the sign of the Mdi2/dt term is opposite 
that of the L1di1/dt term (Equation 9.21). Moreover, if coils

1  and 2 are interchanged, the same argument applies 
to the polarities of the voltages induced in coil 2 due to 
i1 and i2. The subscripts 1 and 2 are simply interchanged 
in the preceding relations.
According to the dot convention, the fluxes due to i1 
and i2 are in the same direction in the core if i1 and i2 both 
enter, or both leave, the dot-marked terminals of their 
respective coils. Otherwise, the fluxes in the core will be 
in opposition. The sign of the Mdi/dt term can therefore 
be determined in a given circuit as follows:
Sign of Mdi/dt term: If the assigned positive directions of 
currents in the two coils are such that these currents both flow 
in, or both flow out, at the dot-marked terminals, the sign of 
the mutual inductance term (Mdi1/dt, or Mdi2/dt) for either 
coil is the same as that of the self-inductance term for that coil 
(L1di1/dt, or L2di2/dt, respectively). Otherwise, the sign of the 
mutual inductance term for either coil is opposite that of the 
self-inductance term for that coil.
Example 9.1:  Equivalent Inductances 
of Series-Connected Coupled Coils
Suppose that the two coils of Figure 9.10 are con-
nected in series, as in Figure 9.12, where terminal 1′ of 
coil 1 is connected to terminal 2 of coil 2 in (a) and to 
terminal 2′ of coil 2 in (b). These connections reverse 
the dot markings, assuming the two coils are wound 
in the same sense in both cases. It is required to deter-
mine the induced voltages and the total inductance in 
each case.
Solution:
	 (a)	 When a current i flows in the coils, there is an induced 
voltage in each coil due to the self-inductance of the

magnetically coupled. Assuming that di/dt > 0, the

polarities shown in Figure 9.13a, as voltage drops in 
the direction of current. Because of the magnetic cou-
pling, i flowing in coil 1 induces a voltage Mdi/dt in 
coil 2, and i flowing in coil 2 induces a voltage Mdi/dt

in coil 1. i enters the two coils at the dot-marked 
terminals in Figure 9.10, so that the flux due to i in 
either coil adds to the flux due to i in the other coil. 
Thus, ϕ12 and ϕ21 in Figure 9.10 add to one another. 
As argued previously, the sign of the Mdi/dt term is 
the same as the Ldi/dt term in each coil, as illustrated 
in Figure 9.13b. The total induced voltages v1 and v2 
in coils 1 and 2 are therefore

coil 1 at the dot-marked terminal and coil 2 at 
the unmarked terminal, which means that the 
flux due to i in either coil opposes the flux due 
to i in the other coil. Thus, ϕ12 and ϕ21 are in 
opposition, as in Figure 9.11, and the sign of the 
Mdi/dt term is now opposite that of the Ldi/dt 
term in each coil, as illustrated in Figure 9.14b.

The effective inductances of coils 1 and 2 are (L1 − M) 
and (L2 − M), respectively. The following should be 
noted for the case of Figure 9.14:
	
1.	If the value of M lies between L1 and L2, then 
one of the inductances, (L1 − M) or (L2 − M), will 
be negative. A negative inductance will have 
a negative reactance, just like capacitance, but 
with a magnitude that is directly proportional to 
frequency.
	
2.	If k = 1 and L1 = L2 = L, then M = L, and Leq = 0. The 
two inductances in series behave as a short circuit, 
because the induced voltage in each coil due to the 
magnetic coupling cancels out the induced voltage 
due to the self-inductance.

Simulation: It is required to verify Equations 9.25 and 
9.29 for two magnetically coupled coils having induc-
tances of 8 and 18 mH, with k = 0.5. The magnetically cou-
pled coils are entered as the part XFRM_LINEAR from 
the ANALOG library. As entered (Figure 9.15), the coil on 
the LHS is L1, that on the RHS is L2, and the default dot 
markings are at the upper terminals of the two coils. The 
coil designations and the dot markings have been added 
in Figure 9.15 for clarity. The values of the inductances 
and the coupling coefficient are entered in the Property 
Editor spreadsheet. The coils are connected in series by 
joining the two lower terminals together. The left part 
of Figure 9.15 corresponds to Figure 9.14. To reverse the 
connections to one of the coils, PSpice allows changing 
the sign of the coupling coefficient instead of changing 
the wiring between the coils. With the coupling coeffi-
cient set to −0.5 in the right part of Figure 9.15, the con-
nection corresponds to that of Figure 9.13.
To determine Leq, a IAC source is used at a frequency 
of 1 rad/s. The voltage across the source is then numeri-
cally equal to the impedance Leq, read by the voltage 
printer. In the Simulation Settings, ‘Analysis type’ is ‘AC 
Sweep/Noise’, ‘Start Frequency’ and ‘End Frequency’ 
are 0.159155, and ‘Points/Decade’ is 1. After the simula-
tion is run, PRINT1 reads 0.014 V at a phase angle of 90°, 
corresponding to Leq = 14 mH, and PRINT2 reads 0.038 V 
at a phase angle of 90°, corresponding to Leq = 38 mH. 
Alternatively, the voltage magnitude and phase can 
be read using ‘Evaluate Measurements’ and select-
ing ‘Analog Operators and Functions’, as explained in 
Example 8.3.
An alternative method of implementing ­magnetic 
­coupling between coils in PSpice, using the part K_Linear, 
is presented in Example 9.2.
Primal Exercise 9.9
Two magnetically coupled coils have self-inductances 
of L1 = 8 mH and L2 = 18 mH, with k = 5/6. Determine 
Leq, and the effective inductance of each coil (a) when 
the coils are connected in series so as to give the larger 
Leq and (b) when the connections to one of the coils are 
reversed.
Ans. M = 10 mH; (a) 46 mH, 18 mH, 28 mH; (b) 6 mH, 
−2 mH, 8 mH.
Primal Exercise 9.10
Given two magnetically coupled coils and an induc-
tance measuring instrument, how would you determine 
the mutual inductance and mark the terminals of the 
coils with dots?
Ans. By measuring the total inductance, before and after 
reversal of connections between the coils.

common impedance between meshes 1 and 2. As a volt-
age rise in mesh 1, the sign of this term is negative, so 
that this term becomes −(−j5)I2. In addition, there is a 
jωMI2 term due to the magnetic coupling between the 
coils in the two meshes. Since both I1 and I2 enter at 
the dotted terminals, the sign of the jωMI2 term is posi-
tive, the same as that of jωL1I1 term in the equation of 
mesh 1, which is +j8I1. The mesh-current equation for 
mesh 1 is therefore

Considering mesh 2, the self-impedance of the mesh is

ance term −(−j5)I1 in the mesh and a jωMI1 term whose 
sign is positive, the same as that of the jωL2I2 term in the 
equation of mesh 2, which is +j32I2. The mesh-current

15.55cos(800t − 170.0°) V.
If the assigned positive direction of I2 in Figure 9.17 is 
reversed and this current is denoted by I2¢ (Figure 9.18), 
then I2¢ flows into the unmarked terminal of coil 2. The 
sign of the mutual inductance term is now opposite 
that of the self-inductance term for each coil. The ZcI2¢ 
term in the mutual impedance between the two meshes 
becomes positive since the voltage drop due to I2¢ flow-
ing in Zc is also a voltage drop in mesh 1. Equations 9.30

the Property Editor spreadsheet is displayed. Change the 
coupling coefficient to 0.25 and enter L3 as the value for

If, say, three magnetically coupled coils are to be 
coupled, the coils are entered as if there is no coupling 
between them, and with the coils oriented so that the 
marked coil terminals correspond to the dotted termi-
nals in the circuit. The part K_Linear is entered three 
times, labeled as K1, K2, and K3. The coil part numbers, 
two at a time, are entered as L1 and L2 values in the 
spreadsheets, together with the corresponding coupling 
coefficients, and the simulation run as usual.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 In deriving KVL or mesh-current equations, particu-
larly in more complicated cases involving magnetic 
coupling between more than two coils, it is often 
helpful to derive these equations first in the absence 
of magnetic coupling and then systematically add 
the terms due to this coupling one at a time.

Example 9.3:  Input Impedance of Coupled Coils
It is required to determine the smallest input impedance 
seen by the current source I1 in Figure 9.25a as R is var-
ied between zero and infinity.
Solution:
The problem will be solved step-by-step in order to 
clearly illustrate some of the concepts involved:
Step 1: If R → ∞, coil 2 on the RHS is open-circuited. No 
current flows in this coil, so there is no induced voltage 
in coil 1 due to current in coil 2, but a voltage is induced 
in coil 2 by I1. With I1 entering the dot-marked terminal

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
on coil 1 and V1 assigned a positive polarity as a voltage 
drop in the direction of I1, then V1 = jωL1I1. The source 
sees an input impedance Zin = V1/I1 = jωL1 = j10 Ω.
Step 2: With V1 and V2 assigned the same positive polar-
ities with respect to the dot markings (Figure 9.25b), 
the voltage induced in coil 2 due to I1 is V2  =  jωMI1, 
­independently of any I2.
Step 3: If R is connected, a current I2 flows in coil 2 under 
the influence of V2. According to Lenz’s law, the direction 
of this current is such that it opposes the flux due to I1. 
Since I1 enters coil 1 at the dot-marked terminal, I2 is con-
veniently assigned a positive direction as leaving coil 2 at 
the dot-marked terminal (Figure 9.25b).

where V2 = jωMI1 is the induced voltage that drives cur-
rent in coil 2. In Equation 9.37, the flow of I2 is opposed 
by the voltage drop RI2 and by the induced voltage jωL2I2 
due to  I2  flowing in the inductor L2, in accordance with 
Lenz’s Law. Note that the sign of the jωM term is oppo-
site that of the jωL term for both coils when these terms 
are on the same side of the equation. This is because the 
source current enters the dot-marked terminal and the 
current in coil 2 leaves at the dot-marked terminal.
Step 5: V1, and hence Zin, has its smallest value when I2 
has its largest value, since I2 opposes the flux due to I1. 
The largest I2 results in the smallest flux in the core and 
hence the smallest V1 and Zin. This also follows from 
Equation 9.36 since the jωMI2 term subtracts from the 
jωL1I1 term to give V1.
Step 6: From Equation 9.37, I2 = jωMI1/(R + jωL2). The 
only variable in this expression for I2 is R, and I2 is larg-
est when R is smallest, that is, when R = 0.
Step 7: When R = 0, I2 = (M/L2)I1. Substituting in Equation 
9.36, V1 = (jωL1 − jωM2/L2)I1, This gives Zin = V1/I1 = jωL1 − 
jω2M2/ωL2 where wM =

9.4  T-Equivalent Circuit
A very useful circuit is the T-equivalent circuit for two 
magnetically coupled coils. Because this circuit has 
three terminals, one being common to input and out-
put, it applies when the two coils also have a common 
terminal, or can be connected in this manner, without 
changing the branch currents and voltages in the circuit, 
which is almost always the case in practice.
There are two forms of the T-equivalent circuit depend-
ing on the relative dot markings. To derive these circuits, 
we note, first, that two magnetically coupled coils of zero 
resistance are completely specified, in circuit terms, by three 
parameters: L1, L2, and M. This implies that three indepen-
dent measurements are needed to fully describe the two 
coils and establish equivalence with another circuit.
Consider two magnetically coupled coils as in 
Figure  9.26a, with a time-varying current i1 in coil 1, 
and coil 2 open-circuited. Let i1, v1, and v2 be measured 
under these conditions. Since coil 2 does not carry cur-
rent, the relation between v1 and i1 is that for a single coil 
that is not affected by current in the other coil, so that v1 
and i1 are related by the v–i relation of an ideal inductor:
	
v

=
	
(9.38)
where a positive sign is used because the assigned posi-
tive directions are those of i1 in the direction of a voltage 
drop v1 (Section 7.2). The voltage induced in the open-
circuited coil 2 is, from Equation 9.3, with M substituted 
for M21,
	
v
M di
dt
2
1
=
	
(9.39)
If di1/dt > 0, terminal 1 is positive with respect to ter-
minal 1′. According to the dot markings, terminal 2 is 
positive with respect to terminal 2′. Hence, Equation 
9.39 is written with a positive sign, with the positive 
direction of v2 assigned as in Figure 9.26a. Both v1 and 
v2 have positive values when di1/dt  >  0 and negative 
­values when di1/dt < 0.

through two inductors in series, (L1 − M) and M, whose 
total inductance is L1 − M + M = L1, so that v1 is related to 
i1 by Equation 9.38. Because no current flows in (L2 − M), 
v2 appears across M and is given by Equation 9.39.
Suppose that coil 2 has a time-varying current i2, with 
coil 1 open-circuited (Figure 9.26c). Let i2, v2, and v1 be 
measured under these conditions. The same aforemen-
tioned argument can be applied to deduce that

in both Figure 9.26c and d. Thus, it was shown that the 
circuit of Figure 9.26b or d reproduced four v–i relations 
at both the input and output terminals of the circuit of 
Figure 9.26a or c under open-circuit conditions. Note 
that equivalence between two circuits applies under 
the same conditions for both circuits. That is, in order 
to establish equivalence, the same terminals in the two 
circuits could be open circuited, or short circuited, or 
have the same resistance connected between them. In 
this case, an open circuit is the simplest case to consider 
for establishing ­equivalence. Hence, it can be concluded 
that the T-equivalent circuit of Figure  9.26b or d is 
equivalent to the two coupled coils with the dot mark-
ings indicated in Figure 9.26a.
Consider, next, the coupled coils of Figure 9.27a, having 
reversed dot markings. It is to be expected that reversing 
the dot markings changes the sign of the M term, so that 
the shunt branch is −M and the series branches are (L1 + M) 
and (L2 + M). We will show that this is indeed the case.
In Figure 9.27a, v1 is given by Equation 9.38, as before, 
and v

However, v

If di1/dt > 0, and since M is a positive number, then 
to have v2 negative in the T-equivalent circuit of Figure 
9.27b, it is necessary that the inductance of the shunt 
branch be −M, instead of +M. The series inductances are 
now (L1 + M) and (L2 + M), so that the total series induc-
tance through which i1 flows is L1 + M − M = L1 and 
Equation 9.38 again applies.
If coil 2 carries a time-varying current i2, with coil 1 
open-circuited (Figure 9.27c), v2 is given by Equation 9.40, 
as before. The induced voltage in coil 1 is ¢ =

its polarity will follow the dot markings, so that v

(Figure 9.27c). The circuit of Figure 9.27d again satisfies 
the v–i relations under these conditions. The T-equivalent 
circuit of Figure 9.27b or d is thus equivalent to the two 
coupled coils with the dot markings as in Figure 9.27a 
or c, respectively. That the shunt inductance is now −M 
is quite acceptable, as the circuit is only meant to repro-
duce the v–i relations for the two coupled coils and not to 
provide a physical correspondence with the two magneti-
cally coupled coils. A more physically based equivalent

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
circuit of the two coupled coils is presented in Section 10.5. 
The T-equivalent circuit is useful in that it eliminates the 
magnetic coupling between the two coils, which allows 
application of any of the conventional methods of circuit 
analysis. If magnetic coupling is retained, analysis is gener-
ally limited to applying KVL or the mesh-­current method.
It should be emphasized that the choice between the 
T-equivalent circuits of Figures 9.26 and 9.27 is dictated 
solely by the relative dot markings of the two coils and is 
independent of the assigned positive directions of currents in 
the two coils or the polarities of the voltages across these coils. 
Changing the assigned positive direction of the current 
in one of the coils, or changing the assigned positive 
polarity of the voltage across the coil, does not change 
the values of the inductances.
Example 9.4:  Equivalent Inductance Using 
T-Equivalent Circuit
It is required to obtain Leq of the series-connected, 
magnetically coupled coils of Example 9.1 using the 
T-equivalent circuit.
Solution:
The two coils in Figure 9.12a are rotated so as to bring them 
in parallel, for easier visualization, as shown in Figure 
9.28a. Terminals 1′ and 2 are connected together and could 
be redrawn as in Figure 9.28b to make the connection 
between the two coils “internal” to the circuit. The coupled 
coils can now be replaced terminal for terminal by the 
T-equivalent circuit, as in Figure 9.28c, the three terminals 
being 1, 2′, and 1′–2 joined together. It is seen from the dot 
markings of the two coils that the appropriate T-equivalent 
circuit is that of Figure 9.27 having inductances (L1 + M), 
(L2 + M), and −M. The −M branch is open-circuited, so that 
the inductance that appears between the outer terminals 1 
and 2′ is Leq = L1 + L2 + 2M, as in Equation 9.31. Note that 
terminal ‘x’ in Figure 9.28c is internal to the T-equivalent 
circuit and does not exist in the original series connection 
of the two coils. Since no current flows in the −M branch, 
this branch could be replaced by a short circuit. The 
induced voltage between terminals 1 and 1′−2, or between 
terminal 1 and node ‘x’ is (L1 + M)di/dt, so that the effective

inductance of coil 1 is (L1 + M) as in Figure 9.13. Similarly, 
the effective inductance of coil 2 is (L2 + M).
The same procedure applied to the two coils in 
Figure 9.12b gives the T-equivalent circuit in Figure 9.29c, 
which is now that of Figure 9.26. The inductance that 
appears between the outer ­terminals 1 and 2′ is Leq = L1 + 
L2 − 2M, as in Equation 9.35. The ­effective inductance of 
coil 1 is (L1 − M), whereas the effective inductance of coil 
2 is (L2 − M).
Example 9.5:  Circuit Analysis Using 
T-Equivalent Circuit
It is required to analyze the circuit in Figure 9.16, 
Example 9.2, using the T-equivalent circuit.
Solution:
The two coils in Figure 9.16 are rotated so as to bring 
them in parallel, for easier visualization, as shown in 
Figure 9.30a. They are then replaced, terminal for ter-
minal, by the appropriate T-equivalent circuit, which 
is that of Figure 9.27. The resulting circuit is that of 
Figure 9.30b. The mesh-current equations are

Problem-Solving Tip
•	 It is generally advantageous to replace magneti-
cally coupled coils having a common connection 
by the appropriate T-equivalent circuit.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 In magnetically coupled coils, the polarity of 
the induced voltage is determined by Lenz’s 
law, as in the case of a single coil, but taking 
into consideration the relative sense of winding 
of the coils.
•	 The relative sense of winding of coils on the same 
core is accounted for by the dot convention.
•	 According to the dot convention, the polari-
ties of the induced voltages are the same at 
the dot-marked terminals of each coil; that is, 
the dot-marked terminals will all become posi-
tive, or negative, together with respect to the 
unmarked terminal. As a corollary, fluxes due 
to currents entering, or leaving, the dot-marked 
terminals in each coil are in the same direction 
in both coils.
•	 The mutual inductance of two magnetically 
coupled coils is the flux linkage in one coil per 
unit current in the other coil. It is independent 
of which coil carries the current.
•	 When two coils are magnetically coupled 
together, there is some leakage flux of each 
coil that links one coil but not the other coil. 
The leakage flux is relatively large when the 
magnetic medium between the two coils is of 
low permeability and is relatively small when 
the coils are wound on a toroidal core of low 
permeability.
•	 The coupling coefficient k
M
L L
=
/
1
2  is a mea-
sure of how well the two coils are coupled 
together through the core. It assumes positive 
values between 0 and 1, where k  =  0 denotes 
no coupling between the two coils and k  =  1 
denotes perfect coupling.
•	 A transformer consists of two or more coils that 
are magnetically coupled relatively tightly. In 
a linear transformer, permeability is constant, 
so that B and H, or λ and i, are linearly related, 
and superposition applies to magnetic variables 
including fluxes.
•	 In writing KVL or mesh-current equations in 
circuits involving magnetically coupled coils,

both the dot markings of coil terminals and the 
assigned positive directions of currents in the 
coils. If the assigned positive directions of cur-
rents are such that these currents both flow in, 
or both flow out, at the dot-marked terminals, 
the sign of the mutual inductance term (Mdi1/dt, 
or Mdi2/dt) for either coil is the same as that of 
the self-inductance term for that coil (L1di1/dt or 
L2di2/dt, respectively). Otherwise, the sign of the 
mutual inductance term for either coil is oppo-
site that of the self-inductance term for that coil.
•	 The T-equivalent circuit is a useful three-­
terminal circuit that can be used to replace, ter-
minal for terminal, two magnetically coupled 
coils having a common terminal. It eliminates 
magnetic coupling between the coils, which 
allows application of any of the conventional 
methods of circuit analysis.
•	 There are two forms of the T-equivalent cir-
cuit, depending on the relative dot markings of 
the coil terminals, irrespective of the assigned 
positive directions of currents in the coils or the 
polarities of the voltages across these coils.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	In deriving KVL or mesh-current equations, 
particularly in more complicated cases involv-
ing magnetic coupling between more than two 
coils, it is often helpful to derive these equations 
first in the absence of magnetic coupling and 
then systematically add the terms due to this 
coupling one at a time.
	
2.	It is generally advantageous to replace magneti-
cally coupled coils having a common connection 
by the appropriate T-equivalent circuit.
Appendix 9A: Energy Stored 
in Magnetically Coupled Coils
Consider two magnetically coupled coils carrying 
steady currents I1 and I2. It is required to determine the 
energy expended in establishing these currents, start-
ing from zero. It is convenient to assume that I1 and I2 
are established by variable current sources in two steps: 
(1) i1 is first increased from zero to I1 with I2
0
=  and (2) i2 
is then increased from zero to I2 with i
I

The first step is illustrated in Figure 9.31a. While i1 
is increasing, the induced voltage v

opposes the increase in i1, in accordance with Lenz’s law, 
by being a voltage drop across L1 in the direction of i1. 
This voltage is concurrently a voltage rise across the cur-
rent source iSRC1, so that the total energy w11 delivered by 
the source is

The second step is illustrated in Figure 9.31b. With a 
constant current i1 = I1, the only voltage induced in coil 2 
is that due to increasing i2, and the total energy supplied 
by the current source iSRC2 in establishing I2 is 1

 in coil 1. The sense of 
winding of coil 2 and the direction of i2 are such that the 
flux associated with i2 is also downward in coil 1, the 
same as the flux in coil 1 due to i1. The effect of increas-
ing i2 is therefore the same as that of increasing i1, so 
that v12 is of the same polarity as v1 in Figure 9.31a and 
opposes the current in coil 1. The current source iSRC1 
has therefore to deliver additional energy to maintain I1.

w1 and w2 must be equal, because in a lossless, linear 
system, the total energy expended must depend only on 
the final values of I1 and I2 and not on the time course of 
i1 and i2 that led to these values. Otherwise, it would be 
possible, at least in principle, to extract energy from the 
system at no energy cost, in violation of conservation of 
energy. Suppose, for example, that w1 < w2. Then I1 and I2 
may be established from zero with expenditure of energy 
w1. In principle, I1 and I2 may be reduced to zero by 
reversing the steps that led to w2, with recovery of more 
energy than was expended, which is clearly impossible. 
Equating w1 and w2, it follows that

If either the polarity of iSRC2, or the sense of winding 
of coil 2, is reversed in Figure 9.31, the flux due to i2 
becomes upward in coil 1. The polarity of v12 is reversed 
and becomes a voltage drop across the current source 
iSRC1. Energy is therefore returned to the source and the 
sign of the energy term involving M becomes negative 
in Equations 9.45 and 9.46. M, however, is always a posi-
tive quantity.
Since I1 and I2 are arbitrary values, they might just as 
well be replaced by instantaneous values i1 and i2. The 
energy stored in the magnetic field in building up the cur-
rents in two magnetically coupled coils to i1 and i2, start-
ing from zero, may therefore be expressed in general as

If the system is nonlinear and involves hysteresis 
(Section 10.5), the time course according to which i1 
and i2 reach their final values does affect the energy 
expended, but the energy difference is dissipated as heat 
in the magnetic material.

two coupled coils, the magnetic energy that depends 
on the self-inductance of 4 mH is 2.2 times the magnetic 
energy that depends on the self-inductance of 1 mH. 
Determine the coefficient of coupling.
	
Ans. 0.75.
P9.11	 Two coils are coupled through a high-permeability 
core. When i1 = 4 A, ϕ11eff(leak) = 0.1 mWb and ϕ21 = 0.4 
mWb. When i2 = 3 A, ϕ12 = 0.6 mWb. If N2 = 1000 turns 
and L2 = 400 mH, determine N1, L1, M, ϕ22eff(leak), and the 
total energy stored in the magnetic circuit when both 
coils carry the aforementioned currents, and the fluxes 
due to these currents are additive.
	
Ans. N1  =  500 turns, L1  =  62.5  mH, M  =  100  mH, 
ϕ22eff(leak) = 0.6 mWb, energy is 3.5 J.
P9.12	 Two coils having N1 = 800 turns and N2 = 500 turns are 
coupled through a high-permeability core. A current i1 
in coil 1 results in ϕ11eff(leak) = 500 μWb and ϕ21 = 400 μWb, 
whereas a current 2i1 in coil 2 results in ϕ22eff(leak) = 1400 
μWb. Determine (a) ϕ12 resulting from 2i1 in coil 2; (b) 
the coefficient of coupling; (c) the mutual inductance, 
assuming that the permeance of the core is 50 nWb/​
A-turn; and (d) the inductance of each coil.
	
Ans. (a) 500 μWb; (b) 0.342; (c) 20 mH; (d) L1 = 72 mH 
and L2 = 47.50 mH.

Objective and Overview
This chapter considers a special case of the linear 
transformer, namely, the ideal transformer, which is of 
­considerable practical and theoretical importance.
The chapter begins by highlighting some basic 
properties of magnetic circuits in order to better 
appreciate the properties of the ideal transformer. 
These properties are then specified, and their impli-
cations carefully considered, leading to the circuit 
attributes of the ideal transformer. Reflection of cir-
cuits from one side of the transformer to the other 
is discussed as an aid to analyzing circuits involving 
ideal transformers.
A special case of the ideal transformer, namely, the 
ideal autotransformer is presented. The chapter ends 
with transformer imperfections, their implications, and 
how they are dealt with in practical transformers.
This chapter builds on some of the basic concepts 
­discussed in Section 7.2 and in Chapter 9.
10.1  Magnetic Circuit
A useful analogy exists between magnetic circuits and 
electric circuits. This analogy may be illustrated by con-
sidering a toroid of conducting material surrounded by 
an insulating medium, as in Figure 10.1a. A magnetic 
field exists inside the toroid, perpendicular to the plane 
of the toroid and directed into the plane of the paper. 
If this magnetic field changes with time, it induces a 
voltage in the toroid, in accordance with Faraday’s law, 
which causes an electric current to flow in the toroid, 
as diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 10.1a. The 
direction of current is clockwise, in accordance with the 
right-hand rule.
Consider next a toroid of magnetic material around 
which a coil is wound, as in Figure 10.1b. When a 
current I flows in the coil, a magnetic field is estab-
lished in the toroid, as diagrammatically illustrated 
in the figure. If the current flows out of the plane of 
the paper around the outer circle of the toroid and 
into the plane of the paper around the inner circle, the 
magnetic field lines, or lines of magnetic flux, in 
the toroid are directed clockwise, in accordance with 
the right-hand rule.
The electrically conducting toroid in Figure 10.1a, in 
which a current flows under the influence of the induced 
voltage, is a simple electric circuit. The toroid of mag-
netic material in Figure 10.1b, in which a magnetic flux 
is established by the coil current, is a simple magnetic 
circuit. These two circuits are analogous in the follow-
ing respects:
	
1.	Both the lines of current flow in Figure 10.1a 
and the lines of magnetic flux in Figure 10.1b 
form closed loops, as is always the case. 
Current lines form closed loops because 
of conservation of charge, as explained in 
Section 1.2. Electric charge cannot be cre-
ated or destroyed, which means that there 
are no sources or sinks of electric charge, so 
this charge can only circulate in closed loops. 
Magnetic flux lines form closed loops because 
magnetic monopoles, that is, isolated north or 
south poles, do not exist. The reason is that all 
magnetic fields are generated by circulating 
currents, as in Figure 10.1b, even at the atomic 
level. Magnetic flux is thus analogous to elec-
tric current:

emf (Section 2.4), since it drives the current 
in the toroid. This induced emf is related to 
the electric field ξ in the toroid by the integral 
relation:

	 where ξ is tangential to the circular lines of cur-
rent flow and the line integral is around the 
closed path of current in the toroid.
Magnetic flux in Figure 10.1b is established by the 
current in the coil wound around the toroid. Ampere’s 
circuital law (Equation 7.12) gives the relation between 
magnetic field strength H in the toroid and the current 
producing the magnetic field as

H is tangential to the circular flux lines and the line 
integral is around the closed path of magnetic flux

Equations 10.2 and 10.3 are of the same form. The line 
integral on the LHS of Equation 10.2 is that of the elec-
tric field associated with the induced voltage, and the 
RHS of the equation is the driving voltage or emf. The 
LHS of Equation 10.3 is the line integral of the magnetic 
field strength associated with current in the coil, and the 
RHS of this equation is NI. By analogy with the RHS 
of Equation 10.2, NI can be considered as the “driving 
force” for the magnetic flux. NI is therefore referred to as 
the magnetomotive force (mmf), analogous to the emf. 
Thus,

Once the analogs of current and voltage are identi-
fied, the analogs of resistance and conductance readily 
follow, as indicated in Table 10.1. Resistance is voltage/
current, so its magnetic circuit analog is mmf/(mag-
netic flux) and is termed reluctance (R). The magnetic 
circuit analog of conductance is flux/mmf and is the 
­permeance (P). It follows that the analog of Ohm’s law 
in the form of v = i/G is

The analogy between magnetic and electric circuits can 
be illustrated by considering a coil wound on a toroidal 
core, taking into account the leakage flux (Section 9.2), 
as in Figure 10.2a. It is assumed, for simplicity, as in 
the calculation of inductance of the coil in Figure 7.15, 
that the diameter of the core is small compared with the 
mean diameter, a, of the toroid. Hc in the core can then 
be considered constant across a transverse cross section 
of the core and is given by Ampere’s circuital law as

The following should be noted concerning Equation 10.9:
	
1.	The permeance depends only on the geometry 
and magnetic properties of the magnetic circuit 
and is independent of the coil current or the 
number of turns of the coil. In contrast, induc-
tance is proportional to the square of the num-
ber of turns (Equation 7.14).
	
2.	Equation 10.9 is analogous to Equation 3.25, in 
the form

(10.10)
	
	 with L identified with the length of path πa.
	
3.	Comparing Equations 10.9 and 10.10, it is seen 
that permeability is analogous to conductivity. 
The higher the permeability of a magnetic mate-
rial, the larger the flux per unit mmf is, just as 
the higher the conductivity of an electrical con-
ductor, the larger the current per unit applied 
voltage is.
What about the leakage path? From superposition, the 
total flux ϕ11 in the coil is (Equation 9.7)

where ϕ11eff(leak) is the effective leakage flux that, when 
multiplied by N1, gives the true value of leakage flux 
linkage of coil 1. Since ϕ11eff(leak), by definition, links all 
the turns of the coil, then if a closed path is followed 
along the path of ϕ11eff(leak) in the space between the coil 
and the core and back, as illustrated in Figure 10.2b, 
the enclosed current is N1i1, just as for a path involving 
the core flux ϕc. In other words, the same mmf N1i1 acts 
on the two paths of the fluxes, ϕc and ϕ11eff(leak).
Dividing both sides of Equation 10.11 by N1i1 converts 
the equation to one involving permeances. Thus,

area of the leakage path is zero, that is, when the coil

the core.
The electric circuit analog, illustrated in Figure 10.2c, 
is a driving voltage N1i1 applied to two conductances in 
parallel. Equation 10.11 is KCL at either essential node.

The following deductions from Equation 10.14 are of 
interest for the discussion in the next section on the ideal 
transformer:
	
1.	For a given flux in the core (ϕc), the larger the 
permeability of the core (μc), the larger Pc is and 
the smaller the required mmf, N1i1, is. In the 
limit, if μc →∞, then Pc →∞, and with ϕc finite, 
N1i1 → 0 (Figure 10.2d). In terms of the electric 
circuit analogy, a finite current ϕc flowing in a 
short circuit (Pc  →∞) requires a zero driving 
voltage (N1i1 = 0).

As in the case of current division between two conduc-

If Pc →∞, then for a given ϕc, ϕ11eff(leak) → 0. This is a conse-
quence of the voltage across the short circuit being zero, 
so that the current through any conductance in parallel 
with the short circuit is zero (Figure 10.2d).

the same time-varying current i1 induces voltages

Example 10.1:  Equivalent Electric Circuit 
of a Shell-Type Core
Given a coil wound on the central limb of a shell-type 
magnetic core, illustrated in Figure 10.3a, it is required to 
derive the analog electric circuit, neglecting leakage flux.
Solution:
The electric circuit analog is shown in Figure 10.3b. 
An mmf Ni is applied by the coil to a circuit consisting 
of the permeance of the central limb Pc in series with 
two conductances Ps in parallel, where Ps is the per-
meance of each of the two side limbs. If the flux in the 
central limb is ϕc, the flux in each side limb is ϕs = ϕc/2. 
The equivalent permeance Peq in series with the source 
Ni is Peq = (Pc × 2Ps)/(Pc + 2Ps) = (PcPs)/(Pc/2 + Ps), and 
ϕc = Ni/Peq.
10.2  Ideal Transformer
10.2.1  Definition
Recall that ideal resistors, capacitors, and inductors 
were defined as possessing certain properties. We will 
similarly define an ideal transformer as an element hav-
ing the following properties:
	
1.	No power losses in the windings or in the core. 
No power loss in the windings implies zero 
resistance of the coils, and no power loss in the 
core implies certain properties of the core mate-
rial, discussed in Section 10.5.
	
2.	No energy stored in the electric field, as was 
assumed in the case of ideal resistors and 
inductors.
	
3.	Perfect magnetic coupling to the core, which 
means no leakage path and no leakage flux.
	
4.	Infinite core permeability μc. Since inductance 
and permeance are both directly proportional to 
permeability, the inductances of the coils, and 
the permeance of the core are also infinite.
Consider an ideal transformer consisting of two coils, 
as in Figure 10.4a. A time-varying voltage v1 is applied 
to coil 1, coil 2 being open-circuited. With zero leak-
age flux, in accordance with item 3 of the definition, 
ϕ11 = ϕc, the flux in the core (Equation 10.11). The volt-
age induced in coil 1 is therefore entirely due to ϕc, the 
flux in the core. Moreover, with zero coil resistance and 
zero leakage flux, the terminal voltage v1 is the same as 
the voltage induced in the coil by ϕc. It follows From 
­Faraday’s law that.

of turns N1 and on the magnitude and time varia-
tion of the applied voltage v1. It does not depend on the 
permeability of the core nor on any current that may be 
flowing in the coil. For example, if v1 = 10cos100t V, 
with t in s and N1  =  1000 turns, then ϕc is uniquely 
­determined by v1 and N1 as 0.1sin100t mWb, irrespec-
tive of μc and i1.
What is then the effect of infinite μc? The effect is on 
the current i1. From the definition of inductance in terms

If ϕc is finite, as determined by v1 and N1, then i1 → 0 
as μc  →∞, and hence L1  →∞. This has two important 
implications:
	
1.	The mmf N1i1 on the core is zero. This is in accor-
dance with Equation 10.5, for if the permeance 
is infinite, with the flux finite, the mmf is zero. It 
was argued in connection with the analog elec-
tric circuit of Figure 10.2d that having finite flux 
and infinite permeance is analogous to a finite 
current (the flux) flowing through a short circuit 
(infinite permeance), the resulting voltage (the 
mmf) being zero.
	
2.	The power input into the transformer v1i1 = 0. 
Hence, no energy is expended in establishing a 
finite ϕc in a core of infinite permeance, which 
means that no magnetic energy is stored in the 
core. With no leakage flux, and no electric energy 
stored in the transformer (assumption 2), this 
means that no energy of any kind is stored in the 
ideal transformer.
The time-varying ϕc induces a voltage v2 in coil 2, whose 
magnitude is given by Faraday’s law: |v2| = N2|dϕc/dt|. 
From Equation 10.19, |v1| = N1|dϕc/dt|. Dividing this 
by the former relation for |v2| gives

(10.21)
Equation 10.21 can be interpreted on the basis that ϕc is 
common to both coils of the ideal transformer of Figure 
10.4a, which means that |dϕc/dt| is the same for the two 
coils. In general, |dϕc/dt| = |v|/N, where |v|/N is the 
magnitude of the induced voltage per turn in any coil wound 
on the core. Applying this equality to the two coils,

which is the same as Equation 10.21. Moreover, as in the 
case of coil 1, the terminal voltage v2 is the same as the 
voltage induced in coil 2 by ϕc, even in the presence of 
coil current, because of the assumptions of zero leakage 
flux and zero resistance.
It should be emphasized that Equation 10.22 in terms 
of the volts induced per turn applies to any number of 
coils of the ideal transformer. In summary, the following 
concept applies:
Concept: In an ideal transformer, the magnitude of the volts 
per turn induced by the flux in the core is the same for all coils 
of the ideal transformer. Because there is no leakage flux and 
no resistance, the induced voltage in any coil is the same as the 
terminal voltage of the coil. The sign of the terminal voltage in 
any given coil is determined by the assigned positive polarity 
of the voltage and the dot markings of the coils.
In Figure 10.4a, the dot markings on the coils are indi-
cated. According to the dot convention, the dot-marked 
terminals of both coils go positive together, or negative 
together. With the terminal voltages v1 and v2 assigned 
as shown, v1 and v2 in Figure 10.4a will always have the

(10.23)
If the assigned positive polarities of v1 and v2 do not 
conform to the dot markings, Equation 10.23 is written 
with a negative sign, as will be elaborated later.
Next, consider that coil 2 is connected to a resistor 
RL (Figure 10.4b), so that i2 flows as indicated. What is 
i1 in this case? As explained earlier, ϕc depends only 
on v1 and N1 and not on any other variables such as 
i1 or i2. Moreover, when μc is infinite, the net mmf act-
ing on the core is zero. Otherwise, a finite mmf multi-
plied by infinite permeance results in infinite flux, and 
hence infinite induced voltage, which is contrary to the 
assumption of a finite applied voltage. It follows that in 
the presence of i2, i1 must be such that the net mmf acting 
on the core is zero. Since permeance is a positive quantity, 
it is seen from Equation 10.5 that mmf and flux have 
the same sign or are in the same sense. That is, if the 
flux is clockwise, for example, then the mmf also acts 
clockwise. In Figure 10.4b, i1 enters at the dot-marked 
terminal of coil 1, whereas i2 leaves at the dot-marked 
terminal of coil 2. According to the dot convention, i1 
and i2 produce fluxes in opposite directions in the core 
and therefore their mmfs are in opposition. To have a 
net mmf of zero acting on the core, N1i1 − N2i2 = 0, which 
gives

This underlies an important concept:
Concept: In an ideal transformer, the net mmf acting on the 
core due to currents in all the coils of the ideal transformer 
must be zero. The sign, or sense, of the mmf due to current 
in a given coil depends on the assigned positive direction of 
­current and on the dot markings.
If Equations 10.23 and 10.24 are multiplied together,

(10.25)
In other words, the instantaneous power input and 
output are equal in an ideal transformer. This is to be 
expected, since an ideal transformer neither dissipates nor 
stores energy.
Figure 10.5 indicates the voltage and current ratios 
of an ideal transformer for different combinations of 
dot markings and assigned positive directions of cur-
rents and polarities of voltages. Note that the symbol 
for an ideal transformer has two parallel lines between 
the two coils. To justify the signs for the voltage and 
­current ratios, consider Figure 10.5d, for example. The 
assigned positive direction of v1 is as shown. v1/N1, the 
induced volts per turn in coil 1, is considered positive, 
with the positively assigned terminal being the termi-
nal marked with a dot. The voltage induced in coil 2 is

This is to be expected from the dot convention and the 
assigned positive polarities of v1 and v2.
The assigned positive directions of currents in 
Figure  10.5d are such that both i1 and i2 enter at the 
dot-marked terminals. The mmf’s therefore add, so 
that for zero mmf in the core, N1i1 + N2i2 = 0. This gives 
i1/i2  =  −N2/N1, as indicated. Note that when the dot 
markings are reversed, for the same assigned positive 
directions of voltage and current, the sign of the turns 
ratio also reverses in the expressions of v1/v2 and i1/i2. 
This is the case in Figure 10.5b compared to Figure 10.5d, 
and in Figure 10.5a compared to Figure 10.5c.

3.	The magnitude of the current ratio is the recip-
rocal of that of the voltage ratio.
	
4.	At any instant of time, the input power and 
­output power are equal.
	
5.	The inductances of the coils are infinite, but 
their ratio is finite and equals the square of the 
turns ratio.

Given vSRC(t) = 10cos(100πt) V in Figure 10.6, determine 
v2, i2, and i1, assuming (a) the dot markings shown and 
(b) reversed dot markings.
Ans. (a) v2(t) = 100cos(100πt) V, i2(t) = 100cos(100πt) mA, 
i1(t) = cos(100πt) A. 
(b) v2(t) = −100cos(100πt) V, i2(t) = −100cos(100πt) mA, 
i1 = cos(100πt) A.
10.2.2  Phasor Relations
The behavior of an ideal transformer can be further 
illustrated using phasor relations. Figure 10.7a shows 
an ideal transformer connected to a load impedance 
ZL, with the corresponding phasor diagram depicted 
in Figure 10.7b. Figure 10.7c is a flow diagram of the 
causal relationships. A voltage V1 applied to coil 1 
establishes a flux ϕc in the core such that ffc
1
V
=

j N

, 
where integration with respect to time is equivalent to 
division by jω in phasor notation. Note that ϕc depends 
on V1, N1, and ω. Because of division by j, ϕc lags V1 
by 90°. The phase angle of V1 is arbitrarily taken as 90°, 
which makes the phase angle of ϕc zero. ϕc induces a 
voltage V2 in coil 2 such that V2
c
= +j N
w
2ff , assuming the 
assigned positive polarities and dot markings shown. 
Since V2 leads ϕc by 90°, because of multiplication by j, 
it is in phase with V1, in accordance with the dot mark-
ings. V2 results in a current I2 that lags V2 by an angle θ, 
assuming ZL is inductive. In order to have zero mmf in 
the core, a current I1 flows such that N1I1 − N2I2 = 0.
In a transformer having only one coil connected to 
a source of excitation, it is usual to refer to this coil as 
the primary winding and to all other coils as second-
ary windings. In Figure 10.7a, V1 is across the primary 
winding and ZL is connected to the secondary wind-
ing. If N2 > N1, so that |v2| > |v1|, the transformer is a

­step-up transformer, since the magnitude of the voltage 
of the secondary winding is larger than that of the pri-
mary winding. Conversely, if N2 < N1, the transformer is 
a step-down transformer.
Primal Exercise 10.3
Determine the phase angles of the phasor currents I1 
and I2 in Figure 10.8 using the voltages as reference.
Ans. The phase angle of I1 is +90°, that of I2 is −90°.

Consider the phasor relation V1 = jωN1ϕc (Figure 10.7). 
Show that this can be expressed as V1rms = 4.44fN1ϕcpeak, 
where V1rms is the rms value of V1 and ϕcpeak is the peak 
value of ϕc.
10.2.3  Reflection of Impedance
The impedance ZLp that appears across the terminals of 
the primary winding in Figure 10.7a due to ZL connected 
across the secondary winding is described as ZL reflected 
to the primary side. This impedance is V1/I1 and its rela-
tion to ZL can be readily determined from the voltage 
and current ratios. For the dot markings and assigned 
positive polarities of voltages and directions of cur-
rents in Figure 10.7a, V1/V2 = N1/N2 and I2/I1 = N1/N2.

Equation 10.30 is valid for any combination of dot mark-
ings and assignment of positive directions of currents and 
polarities of voltages. Thus, reversing the dot markings 
alone changes the sign of the turns ratio in both the volt-
age and current ratios, as was pointed out in connec-
tion with Figure 10.5, but the product remains positive 
when the negative sign is squared. Reversal of either the 
assigned positive polarity of V2, or the assigned positive 
direction of I2, makes the turns ratio negative for the 
voltages or currents, respectively, but makes V2 = −ZLI2, 
so that Equation 10.30 still applies. Similar consider-
ations apply if either the assigned positive polarity of 
V1 or the assigned positive direction of I1 is reversed. 
Impedance never changes sign as it is reflected from 
one side of an ideal transformer to the other, because 
this violates conservation of energy (Problem P10.54).
It follows from Equation 10.30 that a short circuit 
(ZL  =  0) is reflected as a short circuit and an open circuit 
(ZL → ∞) is reflected as an open circuit.
Primal Exercise 10.5
Determine the turns ratio of the ideal transformer in 
Figure 10.9 so that the resistance reflected to the primary 
side is 200 Ω, irrespective of the dot markings.
Ans. 5:1.
Example 10.2:  Reflection of Impedance
It is required to determine VO in the circuit of Figure 10.10a.
Solution:
The first step in the general, basic analysis of circuits 
involving an ideal transformer is to assign voltages and 
currents to the ideal transformer. However, only two 
variables need be assigned, which can be conveniently 
chosen as the voltage on the side of smaller number 
of turns, and the current on the side of larger number 
of turns, in order to avoid working with fractions. In 
Figure 10.10b, the chosen voltage variable is the pri-
mary voltage V1, which makes the secondary voltage 
3V1. The assigned positive directions of the voltages 
are in accordance with the dot markings, in order to 
avoid dealing with negative voltages. The chosen cur-
rent variable is the secondary current I2, which makes 
the primary current 3I2. To avoid working with nega-
tive currents, the directions of the currents are chosen so

that the current ratio is positive. This means that if one 
current is assigned as entering the dot-marked terminal 
on one side, the other current is assigned as leaving the 
dot-marked terminal on the other side.
Since there are two unknowns, V1 and I2, two equa-
tions involving these variables need to be written and 
solved. Once V1 is determined, VO follows as 3V1. One 
equation involving V1 and I2 is provided by Ohm’s law 
for the load resistance: 3V1 = 9I2, or

Solving Equations 10.31 and 10.33 gives V1 = 3 V, so that 
VO = 9∠0° V, the same as the source voltage in this case.
An alternative method is to reflect the 9 Ω resistance 
to the primary side, in accordance with Equation 10.30, 
which gives RLp = 9(1/3)2 = 1 Ω (Figure 10.11a). This 1 Ω 
resistance appears in parallel with the 3 Ω resistance, 
giving a resistance of 0.75 Ω. It follows from voltage 
division that V1 = 9(0.75/2.25) = 3 V (Figure 10.11b) and 
VO = 9∠0° V, as before.
Simulation: The educational version of PSpice does not 
have a part for the ideal transformer. But the ideal trans-
former can be entered as a linear transformer, using 
the part XFRM_LINEAR from the ANALOG library. 
In  accordance with the properties of the ideal trans-
former, the inductances of the two coils are made very 
large but in the ratio of the square of the number of turns. 
The coupling coefficient is unity and its sign is positive 
in accordance with the dot markings in Figure 10.10. 
The circuit is entered as in Figure 10.12, where the value 
of L1 is set at 1 MH and that of L2 as 9 MH. Note that 106 
henries is entered in PSpice as 1 megH, and not 1MH, 
because PSpice is case insensitive and would interpret 
1MH as 1 mH. In the Simulation Settings, ‘Analysis type’ 
is ‘AC Sweep/Noise’; 0.159155 is entered for the ‘Start 
Frequency’ and for the ‘End Frequency’, correspond-
ing to ω = 1 rad/s; and 1 is entered for ‘Points/Decade’. 
After the simulation is run, VO magnitude is read as 
9  V and its phase as essentially zero, using Evaluate 
Measurements and selecting Analog Operators and 
Functions. Note that an ideal transformer could also be 
entered in the same manner but using the part K_Linear, 
as in Example 10.5.

10.2.4  Applications of Transformers
After having discussed the basics of ideal transformers, 
it should be pointed out that the behavior of most types 
of practical transformers closely approximates that of 
ideal transformers, just as the behavior of most types of 
practical capacitors closely approximates that of ideal 
capacitors.
Transformers are widely used for a variety of pur-
poses. They are used for stepping supply voltages up 
or down, for measurement of ac currents and voltages, 
for impedance matching, for generating polyphase 
supplies, and in rectifier circuits, inverters, coupled 
tuned amplifiers, oscillators, and a host of electronic 
circuits. A combination transformer/­inductor, or bal-
last, is commonly used with fluorescent lamps.
10.3  Reflection of Circuits
Reflection applies not only to impedances but to whole 
circuits as well, which effectively removes the ideal 
transformer from the circuit. This is analogous to the 
removal of magnetic coupling between two coils by the 
T-equivalent circuit of a linear transformer. Consider, 
for example, Figure 10.14a having an ideal transformer 
of turns ratio 1:a, that is, N1 turns on winding 1 and 
aN1 turns on winding 2, where N1 need not be speci-
fied. Since excitation is applied to both windings, we 
will not refer to the two sides as primary and second-
ary, but as side 1 (on the left) and side 2 (on the right). 
It follows that I1 = aI2, V2 = aV1, and VL = VS2 + V2. KCL

(10.36)
Equation 10.36 is KCL at node n′ to the right of the 
dashed line in Figure 10.14b. The circuit to the right of 
this line is the circuit connected to side 2 in Figure 10.14a 
but reflected to side 1. In reflecting voltages from one 
side to another, it is easy to remember that, according to 
the induced volts per turn concept, voltages are divided 
by the number of turns on the side of origin and mul-
tiplied by the number of turns on the destination side. 
Impedances are multiplied by the square of the fac-
tor by which voltages are multiplied, and currents are 
divided by the voltage factor. Thus, the voltage source is 
reflected as VS2/a, the impedance as ZL/a2, and the cur-
rent source as aIS2. Winding 1 of the ideal transformer is 
now across the reflected ZL/a2 element, with winding 2 
open-circuited. The current of winding 1 is zero, so that 
the ideal transformer is redundant and can be removed 
from the circuit.
Alternatively, the circuit on side 1 can be reflected to 
side 2. To show this, we note that KCL at node ‘m’ in 
Figure 10.15a is

Equation 10.39 is KCL at node m′ to the left of the 
dashed line in Figure 10.15b. The circuit to the left of 
this line is the circuit connected to side1 in Figure 10.15a 
but reflected to side 2. In accordance with the induced 
volts per turn concept, as explained previously, voltages 
are divided by the number of turns on the side of origin 
and multiplied by the number of turns on the destina-
tion side, currents are divided by this factor, and imped-
ances are multiplied by the square of this factor. Thus, 
the voltage source is reflected as aVSRC, the impedance 
as a2Zsrc, and the current source as IS1/a. The ideal trans-
former now appears across the reflected source, with 
winding 1 open-circuited. The current of winding 2 is 
zero, so that the ideal transformer is redundant and can 
be removed from the circuit.
Suppose that the dot markings are reversed, keep-
ing the same assigned positive directions of currents 
and voltages (Figure 10.16a). Equation 10.35 remains 
unchanged. But now I1 = −aI2 and V2 = −aV1. Substituting

(10.41)
Compared to Equation 10.36, it is seen that the sign 
of a is reversed in Equation 10.41. This equation is KCL 
at node n′ in Figure 10.16b. Comparing this figure with 
Figure 10.14b, it is seen that reversing the dot markings 
reverses the directions of all the currents and voltages 
when reflected from side 2 to side 1.
The procedure for reflecting a circuit from one side of 
an ideal transformer to the other side can be summa-
rized as follows:
	
1.	In reflecting from the side of smaller number 
of turns to the side of larger number of turns, 
voltages are multiplied by the larger-than-unity 
turns ratio, impedances are multiplied by the 
square of this turns ratio, currents are divided 
by this turns ratio, and admittances are divided 
by the square of this turns ratio. Thus, volt-
ages and impedances become larger, whereas 
currents and admittances become smaller. The 
converse applies when reflecting from a side 
of larger number of turns to the side of smaller 
number of turns: voltages and impedances 
become smaller, whereas currents and admit-
tances become larger.
	
2.	When the dot markings on the transformer 
windings are aligned horizontally, polarities 
or directions of source voltages and currents, 
required voltages or currents, and control-
ling voltages and currents are unchanged. 
When the dot markings are aligned diagonally, 
the polarities or directions of these voltages or 
currents are reversed.
	
3.	In reflecting a circuit from one side of the trans-
former to the other, the order of the circuit ele-
ments must be retained.
The procedure for reflecting a circuit from one side of 
an ideal transformer to the other is illustrated by the 
­following examples.
Example 10.3:  Reflection of Circuit
It is required to determine vO in Figure 10.17 by reflect-
ing the circuit on either side of the transformer to the 
other side, assuming ω = 500 krad/s.
Solution:
1/jωC = 1/j(0.5 × 106 × 0.5 × 10−6) = −j4 Ω. The volt-
age phasor representing the sinωt function is arbi-
trarily considered to have a reference phase angle of 
zero, which means that the phase angle of the current 
phasor representing the cosωt function is 90°, since 
cosωt  =  sin(ωt  +  90°). The current phasor is therefore 
represented as j2 A. The circuit in the frequency domain 
is shown in Figure 10.18.
If the circuit on side 2 is reflected to side 1, the circuit 
becomes as in Figure 10.19a. Since the number of turns 
on side 1 is twice that of side 2, the current source is 
divided by 2, to become j A; the resistance is multiplied 
by 4, to become 8 Ω; and VO across the 2 Ω resistance is 
multiplied by 2, to become 2VO. The 6 V source in series 
with 4 Ω is transformed to a current source of 3/2 A in 
parallel with 4 Ω. The two current sources are replaced 
by a single current source of (3/2 + j) A, and the 4 Ω 
resistance is combined with the 8 Ω resistance in parallel

If the circuit on side 1 is reflected to side 2, the cir-
cuit becomes as in Figure 10.20a. Since the number of 
turns on side 2 is half that on side 1, the voltage source 
is divided by 2, to become 3 V, and the resistance and 
reactance are divided by 4, to become 1 Ω and –j Ω. The 
3 V source in series with 1 Ω is transformed to a cur-
rent source of 3 A in parallel with 1 Ω. The two current 
sources are replaced by a single current source of (3 + j2) 
A, and the 1 Ω resistance is combined with the 2 Ω resis-
tance in parallel to give 2/3 Ω. The circuit becomes as

The following example illustrates reflection involving a

Example 10.4:  Reflection of Circuit  
with Dependent Source
It is required to determine VO in Figure 10.23 by reflect-
ing the circuit on the primary side of the transformer to 
the secondary side.
Solution:
Following the procedure outlined previously, the volt-
age source, the dependent current source, and its con-
trolling current are reflected to the secondary side, with 
reversed polarity, because of the placement of the dots. 
The magnitude of the source voltage is divided by 2 and 
the resistances are divided by 4. The magnitudes of the 
current source and its controlling current are multiplied 
by 2. Setting 2IX = IY, the dependent source current is 
related to its controlling current as on the primary side

but with reversed polarities (Figure 10.24). It follows 
from KCL that 2IY + IY = (2.5 – 0.5IY)/0.25, which gives 
IY = 2 mA. Hence, VO = −5 × 2IY = −20 V.
It should be emphasized that the previously discussed 
simple reflection of circuits applies only in the case of 
two windings and in the absence of other coupling 
between the circuits connected to each winding. These 
circuits could be coupled by a subcircuit bridging the 
two sides, as in Figure 10.25a, or by a series-connected 
subcircuit as in Figure 10.25b. The subcircuit could be 
just a simple impedance.

Determine IL in Figure 10.26 (a) by applying the volts/
turn concept, and (b) noting, from the net zero mmf 
equation, that the effective number of turns of the pri-

the secondary side.

10.4  Ideal Autotransformer
The ideal autotransformer is a special type of ideal 
transformer in which the primary and ­secondary wind-
ings are connected together in a particular way. To 
appreciate the idea behind an autotransformer, consider 
for the sake of argument an ideal, step-up (N2  >  N1), 
two-winding transformer having the assigned positive 
polarities of voltages and directions of currents, as in 
Figure 10.27a. The output voltage v2 is that appearing 
solely across the secondary winding. As an alterna-
tive, it is possible to have a smaller induced voltage ¢v2 
added to the primary voltage v1, so that v

Ideal Transformers	
279
The principal advantage of an autotransformer is that 
the added voltage ¢v2, which is smaller than v2, requires 
a winding having a number of turns 
¢
N2 that is less than 
N2. This makes the autotransformer smaller, lighter, and 
less expensive than a two-winding transformer having 
the same input and output voltages and currents. In 
addition, the two windings having the number of turns 
N1 and 
¢
N2 could be a single winding with a bare part, 
devoid of insulation. Terminal ‘a’ in Figure 10.27b is then 
connected to a slider over this bare part of the winding, 
resulting in an autotransformer of variable turns ratio.
If terminals ‘c’ and ‘d’ in Figure 10.27b are connected 
to the source and terminals ‘a’ and ‘b’ are connected to 
the load, a step-down autotransformer is obtained, in 
which the output voltage is smaller in magnitude than 
the input voltage.
The principal disadvantage of the autotransformer 
is that the input and output sides are directly connected 
together. That is, there is a conductive pathway between 
input and output, unlike a two-winding transformer. 
Thus, if a battery is connected between terminals ‘a’ and 
‘d’ of the ideal, two-winding transformer of Figure 10.27a, 
no current flows (Figure 10.28). This is because the insula-
tion between the two windings is assumed to be perfect 
in an ideal transformer, just like the insulation between 
the two plates of an ideal capacitor. Perfect insulation has 
infinite resistance, so that the dc current IB is VB divided 
by an infinite resistance between the two windings, which 
gives IB = 0. In other words, there is no conductive path-
way between the two windings. The two windings are 
said to be electrically isolated from one another. On the 
other hand, if a battery is connected between terminals ‘a’ 
and ‘d’ of the autotransformer of Figure 10.27b, the battery 
is short-circuited by the zero dc resistance of the primary 
winding between terminals ‘a’ and ‘bd’. Electrical isola-
tion is sometimes required in practice to safeguard against 
electric shock, or for other reasons, such as having different 
grounded nodes on the two sides of a two-winding trans-
former. An autotransformer cannot be used in these cases.
The voltage and current relations for the autotrans-
former follow directly from those of the two-­winding 
transformer. The magnitude of the induced volts 
per turn in the primary winding is v1/N1. Hence,

Example 10.5:  Three-Winding Ideal Transformer
Given a three-winding ideal transformer with loads Z2 
and Z3 connected as shown in Figure 10.29, it is required 
to determine the input impedance V1/I1.

mental concepts of the ideal transformer: (1) equality

the windings and (2) net zero mmf on the core. V1 is 
the applied voltage across (N1 + N2) turns and is also the 
induced voltage in these turns, because of the absence of 
flux leakage and resistance in an ideal transformer. The 
magnitude of the induced volts per turn is V1/(N1 + N2). 
The magnitudes of the induced voltages and terminal 
voltages of the other windings are V2 = [V1/(N1 + N2)]N2 
and V3 = [V1/(N1 + N2)]N3. The assigned positive polarities 
of V1, V2, and V3 are in accordance with the dot markings 
on the three windings. It follows that the voltage ratios 
have positive signs:

Consider next the mmf acting on the core. The cur-
rents I1 and (I1 – I2) enter at the dotted terminals of their 
respective windings. Their mmfs are in the same sense 
and may be assigned a positive sign. On the other hand, 
I3 leaves its winding at the dotted terminals, so its mmf 
is assigned a negative sign. Since the net mmf in the core 
must be zero, N1I1 + N2(I1 − I2) – N3I3 = 0.
Moreover, I2 = (1/Z2)V2 and I3 = (1/Z3)V3. Eliminating 
I2, I3, V2, and V3 from the preceding equations gives

reflected impedances in parallel give the input imped-
ance of Equation 10.44. This is equivalent to applying 
each of Z2 and Z3, one at a time, and then paralleling the 
resulting impedances in a manner reminiscent of super-
position. It should be emphasized that superposition 
does not apply, in general, to impedances. However, in 
some cases such as this, the substitution theorem allows 
replacing Z2 and Z3 by current sources to which super-
position can be applied (Problem 10.55).
Simulation: The circuit is simulated using the follow-
ing numerical values: N1 = 3000 turns, N2 = 2000 turns, 
N3 = 5000 turns, Z3 = 10 kΩ, and Z2 is represented by a 
6.25 μF capacitor, with ω = 100 rad/s, so that Z2 = −j1600 Ω. 
The circuit is entered as in Figure 10.30. The three-­
winding ideal transformer is simulated using the part 
K_Linear from the Analog Library. The entries made in 
the Property Editor spreadsheet for this part are L1 for 
L1, L2 for L2, and L3 for L3. The values entered for L1, L2, 
and L3 in the Display Properties window are as indicated 
in the figure. These inductance values are in the ratio of 
the square of the number of turns and are large enough 
to simulate the infinite inductances of the windings of an 
ideal transformer. A 1 A current source is applied so that 
voltage read by the voltage printer is numerically equal to 
the input impedance required. In the Simulation Settings, 
‘Analysis type’ is ‘AC Sweep/Noise’; 15.9155 is entered 
for the Start Frequency and for the End Frequency, cor-
responding to ω = 100 rad/s; and 1 is entered for Points/
Decade. After the simulation is run, the printer readings 
are 5.000E+03 for the real part and −5.000E+03 for the 
imaginary part, in accordance with Equation 10.44.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Voltage and current ratios in an ideal transformer, 
including an autotransformer, having any number 
of windings can always be determined from (1) the 
equality of the magnitude of the induced volts per 
turn in all windings and (2) a net zero mmf acting 
on the core, taking into account in both cases the 
dot markings at the terminals of the windings.
10.5  Transformer Imperfections
Practical transformers depart from the ideal in the 
­following respects:
	
1.	Finite resistance of the windings. This may be 
accounted for, at least at low frequencies, by 
adding appropriate resistances at the terminals 
of the windings.

2.	Core losses, as described later in this section. 
These can be accounted for, in an approximate 
manner, by a resistance connected across the 
primary winding.
	
3.	Energy stored in the electric field associated 
with voltage differences between windings and 
between the turns of each winding. This energy 
can be theoretically represented by distributed 
capacitance but can be accounted for, in an 
approximate manner, by lumped capacitances 
connected across the terminals of each winding 
and between windings (Problem P10.58).
	
4.	Finite inductance of the windings and finite 
leakage flux. These will be considered in what 
follows because of their decisive effect on the 
frequency range over which a transformer can 
operate satisfactorily.
A transformer that is ideal except for finite inductance 
of the windings and finite leakage flux is in effect a linear 
transformer consisting of two coupled, lossless coils, of 
self-inductances L1 and L2 and a coupling coefficient that 
is less than unity. The transformer is shown represented 
in the frequency domain in Figure 10.31, connected to a 
source VSRC on the primary side and to a load ZL on the 
secondary side. The governing KVL equations are

where the sign of the M term is opposite that of the L1

Equation 10.49 is to be expected, for if the secondary 
winding is open-circuited, the impedance seen by the 
source is simply that of the primary winding.
Any circuit that represents the effect of finite induc-
tances of windings and finite leakage fluxes must satisfy 
Equations 10.45 through 10.49 under the same condi-
tions, such as open-circuited secondary, short-circuited 
secondary, and perfect or imperfect coupling.

(10.50)
The interpretation of Equation 10.50 is that VSRC/I1, 
the impedance seen by the source, is the parallel imped-
ance of L2 and ZL on the secondary side, reflected to the 
primary side of an ideal transformer of inductance ratio 
L1:L2, as shown in Figure 10.32a. This is in accordance with 
­impedance reflection (Equation 10.30), bearing in mind 
that the ratio L1:L2 is the square of the turns ratio (Equation 
10.26). The impedance jωL2, when reflected to the primary 
side, becomes jωL2(L1/L2) = jωL1, as in Figure 10.32b. As 
a check, if ZL →∞, VSRC/I1 = jωL1, as in Equation 10.49. 
Note that the finite inductance of the two windings is 
accounted for either by L2 across the secondary winding 
or by L1 across the primary winding, but not both.
10.5.2  Finite Leakage Flux
The next step is to modify the circuit of Figure 10.32b 
so as to include the effect of leakage flux. Since equiv-
alence must apply for any value of ZL, we can conve-
niently assume the special case of ZL = 0, in which case 
VSRC/I1 is given by Equation 10.48. When terminals 22'

inductance ratio is modified to k2L1:L2, as in Figure

circuit of a transformer that is ideal except for finite 
inductances of the windings and finite leakage flux.
That the circuit of Figure 10.33b satisfies Equations 
10.45 and 10.46 is verified in Example 10.6.

10.5.3  Frequency Range
For simplicity and to illustrate clearly the basic 
ideas involved, we will assume resistive load and 
source impedances. Consider a load RL connected to 
a source of voltage VSRC and impedance Rsrc through 
a transformer represented by the equivalent circuit 
of Figure 10.33b. Let 
¢
RL and 
¢
VL be, respectively, the 
load impedance and voltage referred to the primary 
side. The circuit becomes that of Figure 10.36a. At a 
low enough frequency, the reactance ωk2L1 in paral-
lel with

According to Equation 10.58,

is inoperative, since the core flux is not time varying and 
no voltage is induced in the secondary winding. Note 
that the preceding argument still applies if at low fre-
quencies jω(1 – )k2L1 is much smaller than Rsrc.
At a high enough frequency, the shunting effect of 
the impedance jωk2L1 on ¢
RL becomes negligible, and 
the circuit reduces to that of Figure 10.36c. It follows

still applies if at high frequencies jω(1 – )k2L1 is much 
larger than Rsrc. It follows that
Concept: The performance of a nonideal transformer is lim-
ited at low frequencies by the reactance of the windings and at 
high frequencies by the leakage reactance.
It is seen from the preceding discussion that the low 
and high frequencies at which a transformer is no longer 
useful depends on the source and load impedances. But 
it remains generally true that transformers intended for 
low frequencies must have large inductances of wind-
ings, which requires a large number of turns and a large 
cross-sectional area of the core, for a given core perme-
ability (Equation 7.24). The transformer becomes large 
in size and more expensive. On the other hand, high-
frequency transformers, such as pulse transformers, can 
be of small size but must have a low leakage flux. They 
commonly have a toroidal core in order to reduce the 
leakage flux.
10.5.4  Core Losses
These are of two types: eddy-current losses and hys-
teresis losses. Eddy-current losses occur in any core 
made of electrically conducting material. We have so far 
neglected the effect of the time-varying magnetic flux on 
the core itself. This time-varying flux induces a voltage 
around any closed path in the core that encloses some 
or all of the core flux. If the core material is electrically 
nonconducting, the induced voltage does not cause 
the flow of current in the core, and there is no effect on 
transformer behavior. However, it is impractical to have 
transformer cores made of perfectly nonconducting 
material, which means that the time-varying flux in the 
core will result in current in the core.
The case of a core of electrically conducting mate-
rial is illustrated in Figure 10.37a, which shows a coil 
wound on such a core. A cross section of the core, shown 
enlarged, will have a time-varying core flux that is nor-
mal to the cross section. Any closed path around the flux 
lines in this cross section will have a voltage induced 
in it in accordance with Faraday’s law. Since the core is 
conducting, this voltage will produce a current in this 
closed path, known as an eddy current, similar to the 
eddies produced in a turbulent flow of water. There 
are innumerable closed paths in an innumerable num-
ber of cross sections around the core, with the resulting 
eddy currents merging into a definite pattern of current 
flow in the core that depends on the shape of both the 
core and its cross section as well as the frequency of the 
applied voltage.
The eddy currents have two undesirable effects: (1) as 
in any current flow through a conductor, power is dis-
sipated because of resistance, which results in heat-
ing, and (2) in accordance with Lenz’s law, the eddy 
currents produce a flux, indicated in Figure 10.37a as 
eddy-­current flux, which opposes the inducing flux. 
The resulting flux in the core is the difference between 
the flux due to the winding in the absence of eddy cur-
rents and that due to the eddy currents. The second 
undesirable effect of eddy currents is therefore to reduce 
the flux in the core.
The eddy currents are reduced in one of two ways. 
In high-frequency transformers, such as small toroidal 
transformers, the core is made of ceramic-type materi-
als, known as ferrites, composed of oxides of iron and 
other metals such as nickel, zinc, and manganese. These 
have high resistivity, which, for a given voltage induced 
by flux in a loop in the core, practically eliminates eddy 
currents. At low frequencies, ferrite cores are imprac-
tical because of transformer size. Eddy currents are 
reduced in low-frequency transformers by assembling 
the core using thin laminations. These are insulated 
from one another and stacked together so that the flux 
is in a direction parallel to the plane of the laminations 
(Figure 10.37b). The induced currents are confined by 
the insulation to within each lamination. This effec-
tively reduces the cross-sectional area of the loop that 
encloses flux and which can give rise to current flow, 
as illustrated in the figure. The induced voltage and 
hence the eddy currents are thereby greatly reduced. 
Laminations are usually made of iron alloys such as 
silicon steel, in which the added silicon increases the 
resistivity. The insulation is usually in the form of a thin 
layer of varnish.
Iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys are 
­ferromagnetic materials that have the desired charac-
teristic of high permeability. However, this permeability

is not constant, so that the B─H relation is nonlinear and 
also exhibits another type of nonlinearity in the form of 
hysteresis. In general, hysteresis arises when an effect 
lags behind its cause, as can happen in mechanical 
systems due to friction. As a result of hysteresis, the 
state of a system depends on its previous history, that 
is, the manner in which this state is reached. To illus-
trate hysteresis, consider that H in an initially unmag-
netized ferromagnetic specimen is increased from zero. 
B increases along a curve such as OP in Figure 10.38 
that flattens out at large values of H. This flattening of 
the curve B─H curve at high values of H is described as 
magnetic saturation. If, at point P, H is reduced, B lags 
behind H. When H is reduced to zero at Q, B retains the 
value of the positive intercept on the B-axis. To reduce 
B to zero at R requires a negative H. Making H more 
negative still brings the operating point to S. If H is 
now increased back to Hm, B changes along the lower 
part of the curve, STUP. It is seen that at a particular 
value Hx, for example, B can take on different values 
corresponding to points 1, 2, or 3, or intermediate val-
ues, depending on how Hx is reached. The loop that is 
traced by a cyclic variation in H is a hysteresis loop. 
With H proportional to current and B proportional to 
voltage, the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop repre-
sents power dissipated in the core and not returned to 
the supply. The power dissipation also appears as heat 
in the core.
Hysteresis is put to good use in permanent magnets, 
where the residual magnetism of such a magnet is due 
to the intercept OQ on the vertical axis of the B─H hys-
teresis curve. The intercept OQ is referred to as the 
remanence, whereas the intercept OR is the coercivity.
Both eddy-current loss and hysteresis loss are a func-
tion of the magnitude of the core flux ϕc. The voltage 
across the branch jωk2L1 in Figure 10.33b can be con-
sidered proportional to ϕc. Core losses are sometimes 
accounted for by adding, in parallel with this branch, a 
resistance Rc whose value is such that the same power is 
dissipated in this resistance as in the core.
10.5.5  Construction of Small Inductors 
and Transformers
Small transformers at high frequencies commonly have 
toroidal ferrite cores, as illustrated in Figure 10.39a. 
Small inductors and transformers at power and audio 
frequencies have laminated cores that are usually rect-
angular in shape or of the shell type. Figure 10.39b is an 
outside view of a small, two-winding transformer hav-
ing a shell-type core. Figure 10.39c is a cutaway view of 
a shell-type transformer.
The windings are wound on formers of rectangular 
or preferably square cross section that are fitted around 
one or both sides of a rectangular core (Figure 10.37) 
or around the central limb of the shell-type core. The 
formers are commonly made from plastic or impreg-
nated cardboard. They are not shown in Figure 10.39 
for a clearer view of the windings. The shell-type core 
is compact and rugged and naturally conforms to the 
two-sided distribution of the magnetic field of the 
windings (Figure 10.3).
Both primary and secondary windings are wound 
using insulated wire and are usually mounted one on 
top of the other, with the lower-voltage winding closer to 
the core, to reduce the stress on the insulation, since the 
core is usually connected to ground. Having the primary 
and secondary windings on separate limbs of a rectan-
gular core (Figure 9.9) markedly reduces the coupling 
between them but reduces the capacitance between the 
two windings and practically eliminates the possibility 
of a direct short circuit between the two windings in the 
event of insulation breakdown. This type of construc-
tion is seldom used except for special applications, such 
as safety isolation transformers where it is essential to 
have the primary and secondary sides isolated even in 
the event of insulation breakdown. Alternatively, isola-
tion between primary and secondary windings could be 
achieved by having a grounded metallic screen between 
the two windings. The screen also prevents coupling 
between primary and secondary windings through the 
interwinding capacitance. This is illustrated diagram-
matically in Figure 10.40, where a grounded screen is 
interposed between the two windings. Each winding 
now has a capacitance to ground but not directly to the 
other winding.

is analogous to a driving voltage. Permeance 
and permeability are analogous to conductiv-
ity and conductance, respectively. The analog of 
Ohm’s law in the form v = i/G is mmf = flux/
permeance.
•	 Permeance depends only on the geometry and 
magnetic properties of the magnetic circuit and 
is independent of the coil current or the number 
of turns of the coil.
•	 For a coil wound on a magnetic core, the ­following 
applies:
	
1.	 The total permeance of the magnetic circuit 
is the sum of the permeance of the core and 
the leakage path, with the same mmf acting 
on both the core and the leakage path. The 
electric circuit analog is an emf acting on 
two conductances in parallel.
	
2.	 If the core permeability is infinite, the 
core permeance and inductance are infi-
nite. Zero mmf is required to establish a 
finite flux in a core of infinite ­permeability. 
The  zero mmf will not drive any flux in 
the leakage path that is in parallel with the 
core path.
	
3.	 The permeances of the core and the leakage 
path are in parallel because the same mmf acts 
on both. The inductances of the core and the 
leakage path are in series because the same 
time-varying coil current induces  ­voltages 
due to the changing core flux and leakage 
flux that add together in the coil.
•	 The defining properties of an ideal transformer 
and their implications are as follows:
	
1.	 No power losses, implies zero coil resistance 
and no eddy currents or hysteresis in the 
core.
	
2.	 No electric stored energy, implies neglect-
ing the electric field between the turns of a 
transformer coil and between different coils 
of the transformer.
	
3.	 Perfect coupling to the core, that is, zero 
leakage flux, implies, together with zero 
resistance of the coils, that the terminal 
voltage of any given coil is the same as the 
­voltage induced in the coil by the core flux.
	
4.	 Infinite core permeability, implies zero mmf 
on the core, and no magnetic energy stored 
in the transformer.

Ideal Transformers

ideal two-coil transformer are as follows:
	
1.	 Transformer voltage equation: 
v

= ±
, 
where the sign is positive if the assigned 
positive polarities of the voltages conform 
to the dot markings of the two coils and is 
negative otherwise. The voltage equation 
expresses the fundamental concept that 
the magnitude of the induced volts per 
turn is the same for all the coils of an ideal 
transformer
	
2.	 Transformer current equation: 
i

N

= ±
,
where the sign is negative if the assigned 
positive directions of currents are such 
that both currents flow into, or out of, the 
dotted terminals and is positive otherwise. 
The current equation expresses the fun-
damental concept that the net mmf on the 
core is zero.
	
3.	 At any instant of time, the input power and 
output power are equal.
	
4.	 The inductances of the coils are infinite, but 
their ratio is finite, because it is independent 
of μc and is equal to the square of the turns 
ratio.
	
5.	 Impedance can be reflected from one side 
of an ideal transformer to the other  by 
multiplying by the square of the ratio 
by which the voltage is multiplied. The 
reflected impedance is independent of the 
dot markings. Consequently, a short circuit 
(ZL = 0) is reflected as a short circuit, and 
an open circuit (ZL → ∞) is reflected as an 
open circuit.
•	 In the case of an ideal transformer having two 
windings that are not externally coupled, as 
through a bridge-connected or a series-con-
nected subcircuit, the circuits on either side of 
the transformer can be reflected to the other 
side. The procedure for reflecting a circuit from 
one side of an ideal transformer to the other side 
can be summarized as follows:
	
1.	 In reflecting from the side of smaller number 
of turns to the side of larger number of turns, 
voltages are multiplied by the larger-than-
unity turns ratio, impedances are multiplied 
by the square of this turns ratio, currents are 
divided by this turns ratio, and admittances 
are divided by the square of this turns ratio. 
Thus, voltages and impedances become 
larger, whereas currents and admittances 
become smaller. The converse applies when 
reflecting from a side of larger number of 
turns to the side of smaller number of turns: 
voltages and impedances become smaller, 
whereas currents and admittances become 
larger.
	
2.	 When the dot markings on the transformer 
windings are aligned horizontally, polarities 
or directions of source voltages and currents, 
required voltages or currents, and control-
ling voltages and currents are unchanged. 
When the dot markings are aligned diago-
nally, the polarities or directions of these 
voltages or currents are reversed.
	
3.	 In reflecting a circuit from one side of the 
transformer to the other, the order of the cir-
cuit elements must be preserved.
•	 In an ideal autotransformer, a second wind-
ing is connected so that its voltage adds to, 
or ­subtracts from, the voltage of the primary 
winding. The result is a smaller total num-
ber of turns, but a loss of electrical isolation 
between the circuits on the two sides of the 
transformer.
•	 The ideal autotransformer is analyzed in exactly 
the same way as a conventional two-winding 
transformer, based on the same magnitude of 
the induced volts per turn in each winding, 
and zero net mmf in the core, while taking into 
account the dot markings at the terminal of each 
winding.
•	 The finite inductance of the windings and the 
finite leakage flux in a nonideal transformer can 
be accounted for by adding appropriate series 
and shunt inductances to an ideal transformer 
of modified turns ratio. The performance of a 
nonideal transformer is limited at low frequen-
cies by the reactance of the windings and at 
high frequencies by the leakage reactance.
•	 There are two types of core losses in a nonideal 
transformer: eddy-current loss and hysteresis 
loss. Both of these losses result is power dis-
sipation in the core that results in heating of 
the core.
	
1.	 Eddy-current loss arises because of the 
­currents induced in an electrically con-
ducting core, with resultant power dissipa-
tion and reduction of flux in the core. It is 
mitigated at low frequencies by laminating 
the core and at high frequencies by using 
a core of metallic oxides that have high 
resistivity.

288	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
	
2.	 Hysteresis is exhibited by ferromagnetic 
materials due to a lag of B behind H. As a 
result, a hysteresis loop is formed when H 
is varied in a cyclic manner. The area of the 
loop represents a power loss that results in 
heating of the core. Moreover, a given value 
of, say, H can be associated with a range of 
values of B, depending on how this value of 
H is reached.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	In analyzing a circuit using an ideal transformer, 
assign one voltage variable on one side of the 
transformer, usually the side of smaller number 
of turns, and one current variable on the other 
side. The other voltage and current of the trans-
former are expressed in terms of the assigned 
variables and the turns ratio.
	
2.	The polarities and directions of the transformer 
voltages and currents are assigned in accor-
dance with the dot markings so as to avoid 
negative transformer voltages and currents on 
either side of the transformer.
	
3.	In reflecting from a side of smaller number of 
turns to the other side, voltages and imped-
ances become larger, whereas currents and 
admittances become smaller. The converse 
applies when reflecting from a side of larger 
number of turns to the other side: voltages and 
impedances become smaller, whereas currents 
and admittances become larger.
	
4.	Voltage and current ratios in an ideal trans-
former, including an autotransformer, having 
any number of windings can always be deter-
mined from (a) the equality of the magnitude of 
the induced volts per turn in all windings and 
(b) a net zero mmf acting on the core, taking into 
account in both cases the dot markings at the 
terminals of the winding.

P10.53	 Consider the definition of an ideal transformer. Argue 
that the voltage equation (Equation 10.23) is satisfied 
by assuming zero coil resistance, no coil currents, and 
infinite core permeability, even in the presence of a 
leakage path. Then argue that in the presence of cur-
rent in the coils, the equation is not satisfied unless it is 
assumed that the coupling is perfect, that is, there is no 
leakage path and hence no leakage flux.
P10.54	 The circuit of Figure P10.54 is purely passive, no 
energy being generated. The circuit remains passive if 
R is reflected as a2R to the left side. However, if R is 
reflected as –a2R, argue that energy is delivered to RA, 
which violates conservation of energy.

Objective and Overview
This chapter examines the basic responses of RC and RL 
circuits to initial energy storage or to dc excitation.
The first part of the chapter is concerned with the 
­discharging of a capacitor or an inductor through a 
resistor and the charging of these energy storage ele-
ments when associated with a resistor and connected to 
a dc source. In discussing the circuit responses, duality 
is extensively illustrated and physical interpretations 
are strongly emphasized.
First-order circuits are later generalized to include 
more than one resistor and more than one capacitor 
or inductor as well as dependent sources. A general 
­procedure is formulated for analyzing first-order 
circuits in response to initial energy storage or to dc 
excitation without having to derive and solve the dif-
ferential equation. The chapter ends with an explana-
tion of the role of the transient component of circuit 
responses.
11.1  Capacitor Discharge
Consider a capacitor C connected to a battery of voltage 
VSRC and to a resistor RC through a changeover switch, 
as illustrated in Figure 11.1a. When the switch is in posi-
tion ‘a’, the capacitor is charged to the battery voltage 
VSRC and stores electric energy 1 2
2
/
(
)CVSRC. Suppose that 
the switch is moved at t = 0 to position ‘b’ so that the 
capacitor and resistor in parallel are isolated from the 
battery (Figure 11.1b). In all switching operations, it is 
tacitly assumed that switching occurs instantaneously. 
If the switch is moved at t = 0, then t = 0− denotes the 
instant of time just before the switch is moved, whereas 
t = 0+ denotes the instant of time just after the switch is 
moved. These two instances of time are considered to 
be infinitesimally separated. It should be noted in this 
connection that if a function is continuous at t = 0, that 
is, it does not have a step, or discontinuity at t = 0, the 
value of the function is the same at t = 0, t = 0−, or t = 0+.
In Figure 11.1a, the voltage across the capacitor, just 
before the switch is moved, is v(0−) = VSRC. What is v(0+) 
just after the switch is moved? The answer is that it is 
still VSRC because of the following universal concept:
Concept: Energy in general, including stored energy, can-
not be changed instantaneously by any physically realizable 
means, as this would require infinite driving forces, that is, 
infinite voltages or currents in the case of energy storage 
­elements in electric circuits. Such infinite values are not 
­physically realizable.
Mathematically, this concept is embodied in the 
­derivative/integral form of the v–i relation of ideal 
energy storage circuit elements. Considering the deriv-
ative form of the v–i relation of a capacitor, i = Cdv/dt, 
an instantaneous change in v implies that dv/dt → ∞. 
This would require an infinite i, which is not physi-
cally realizable (but refer to Example 11.7 for more on 
this). Alternatively, it can be argued that dv = idt/C. As 
dt → 0 at the instant of switching, then as long as i 
remains finite, dv → 0, which means that the change in 
the capacitor charge, and hence v, is zero at the instant 
of switching. It follows that in Figure 11.1, v at t = 0+ 
is the same as t = 0−, although i starts to flow at t = 0+. 
It is like suddenly opening an outlet valve at the bot-
tom of a vessel containing some water. The outflow, 
analogous to i, in Figure 11.1b jumps instantly from 
zero to some finite value. However, at the instant of 
opening the outlet valve, water has not yet flowed out 
of the vessel so that the amount of water in the tank, 
analogous to the stored charge, does not change at this 
instant.
Similarly, for an inductor, di = vdt/L. As dt → 0 at the 
instant of switching, then as long as v remains finite,

instant of switching.
Although v(0+)  =  VSRC in Figure 11.1b, v does not 
remain constant at this value for t ≥ 0+. This is because

RC is now connected across C, resulting in a current 
i(0+)  =  VSRC/RC. This current carries positive charge 
from the upper plate of the capacitor through the resis-
tor to the lower plate, thereby neutralizing some of the 
negative charge on this plate. The capacitor charge, and 
hence voltage, therefore decreases with time, as long as 
i continues to flow. As t → ∞, the charge on the capaci-
tor is reduced to zero, that is, the capacitor is fully dis-
charged, so that v and i become zero. It is required to 
determine how v and i vary with time for t ≥ 0+.
If we choose i as the variable for analyzing the circuit 
in Figure 11.1b, then we are in effect considering the cir-
cuit to be a series circuit, in which KCL is automatically 
satisfied and KVL has to be expressed in terms of the v–i 
relations of C and RC. On the other hand, if we chose v as 
the variable for analyzing the circuit, we are in effect con-
sidering the circuit to be a parallel circuit, in which KVL 
is automatically satisfied and KCL has to be expressed in 
terms of the v–i relations of C and RC. Choosing the lat-
ter case, we have, for the resistor, i = v/RC, whereas for 
the capacitor, i = −Cdv/dt, where the minus sign applies 
because i through the capacitor is in the direction of a volt-
age rise v across the capacitor (Equation 7.7). KCL gives

where τC = RCC is the time constant.
Mathematically, the responses of lumped-parameter, 
linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits are governed by lin-
ear, ordinary, differential equations with constant coef-
ficients, whose order depends on the number of distinct 
energy storage elements in the circuit, as will be clarified 
later. Equation 11.2 is an example of such a differential 
equation of the first order, since the highest order of 
the derivative of v is the first derivative. For the sake of 
brevity, we will henceforth refer only to the order of cir-
cuit differential equations, without the other attributes. 
Circuits having a single energy storage element are 
referred to as first order because their responses obey 
first-order differential equations.
The variation of v with time is given by the solution 
of Equation 11.2. Although the solution can be readily 
obtained by straightforward integration after separation 
of variables (Exercise 11.1), let us digress a little and con-
sider a more general approach that will be first applied 
to the first-order differential equation

where y is a variable that can be a current or a voltage. 
A differential equation with the variable and its deriva-
tives on the LHS and zero on the RHS, as in Equation 11.3, 
is referred to as the homogeneous differential equation. 
The general solution of a homogeneous, linear, ordinary, 
differential equation of any order, but having constant 
coefficients, is the sum of exponentials of the form Aest, 
where A and s are constants that depend on the circuit 
and on the initial conditions, and where the number of 
exponential terms in the sum is equal to the order of the 
differential equation. Since Equation 11.3 is of the first 
order, its general solution is y(t) = Aest. Substituting in 
Equation 11.3 and collecting terms,

To satisfy Equation 11.4, either A = 0 or the terms in 
brackets must add to zero. If A = 0, then y = 0, and the 
response is zero. This is a trivial solution that contradicts 
the assumption of initial energy storage in the circuit. It 
follows that in order to satisfy the differential equation,

(11.5)
This equation in s is the characteristic equation of 
the differential equation. It gives the value of s as −1/τ,

the circuit parameters, which are R and C in the case of 
the RC circuit of Figure 11.1. The general solution is then

A is an arbitrary constant that corresponds to the 
constant of integration, since, formally, the solution of 
a first-order differential equation involves a single inte-
gration. The value of A can be determined from initial 
conditions. Substituting t  =  0+ in Equation 11.6 gives 
y(0+) = A. This initial value may also be denoted as y0. We 
conclude, therefore, that the solution to Equation  11.3

Equation 11.7 is a decaying exponential function. It

so that its value is unity at t = 0− or t = 0+. At x = 1 or t = τ, 
the response decreases to 1/e or approximately 36.8% of 
its initial value. Another interpretation of τ is based on 
the magnitude of the slope at x = 0. Thus,

at x  =  0, the tangent intersects the horizontal axis at 
x = 1 or t = τ. The interpretation is that if the response 
decreases linearly at the initial, maximum rate, instead 
of exponentially, the response is reduced to zero at t = τ.
Note that if a variable decays exponentially with a 
time constant τ, as in the case of y(t) in Equation 11.7, 
then y(t + τ) = y(t)/e, which means that for every time 
interval τ, y(t) is reduced at the end of the interval to 1/e 
of its value at the beginning of the interval. After five 
time constants, the response decays to 1

e =
 or 
0.67% of its initial value. This is close enough to zero for 
most practical purposes.
The time constant is an important parameter of a 
first-order response in that it is indicative of the speed 
of response of the circuit. The larger the time constant, 
the longer it would take the response to reach a given 
fraction of its initial value; conversely, the smaller the 
time constant, the faster is this fraction reached. This is 
illustrated in Figure 11.3, which shows a simulation of 
the three exponentials corresponding to time ­constants 
of 1, 0.5, and 0.25 s. Note that in each case, the tangent to 
the curve at t = 0 intersects the time axis at t = τ.
Concept: The time constant of a first-order circuit is a 
measure of its speed of response. The larger the time con-
stant, the slower or more ‘sluggish’ the response is and 
conversely.
Comparing Equations 11.2 and 11.3, the variation of v 
with time is obtained from Equation 11.7 by replacing y 
with v, y0 with V0, and τ with τC = RC, which gives

Both v and i are decaying exponentials as in Figure 11.2, 
since they are related by Ohm’s law for RC. As t → ∞, 
v and i go to zero. The charge carried by the current com-
pletely discharges the capacitor (Primal Exercise 11.2), 
and the energy initially stored in the capacitor is dissi-
pated in the resistor (Problem P11.57).

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
It may be wondered why v and i decay exponentially 
with time rather than linearly. The answer lies in the rate 
at which v decreases. A linear decrease implies that v 
decreases at a constant rate, irrespective of the value of v 
at any given time. In fact, however, v does not decrease 
at a constant rate. From the v–i relation for the capacitor, 
the rate of decrease of v, which is −dv/dt, is
	
-
=
dv
dt
i
C	
(11.11)
That is, the decrease in v is proportional to i, because 
with the assigned positive directions of v and i as in 
Figure 11.1b, the decrease in v is due to the discharg-
ing of the capacitor by i. But with RC connected across 
the capacitor, v and i are related by Ohm’s law, v = RCi. 
Substituting in Equation 11.11,
	
-
=

v
R C
C 	
(11.12)
As v decreases, therefore, the rate of decrease of v also 
decreases. In other words, v decreases at a progressively 
reduced rate as the capacitor discharges. Mathematically, 
when the rate of decrease of a variable at any instant t is 
proportional to the value of the variable at that instant, 
the variable decays exponentially.
The system response that arises solely from the ini-
tial energy storage, with no other inputs, is the natural 
response of the system.

Problem-Solving Tip
•	 In the exponent t/τ, t naturally has the same units 
as τ. If τ is in seconds, then t is in seconds, and if τ 
is in ms, then t is in ms. If t is in seconds and is to 
be expressed in ms, while keeping the same value 
of the exponent, then the new t in ms should be 
multiplied by s/ms or 10−3. Another way of look-
ing at this is that t in ms is a larger number than t 
in s, so t in ms in the exponent must be multiplied 
by 10−3 to maintain the same numerical value of 
the exponent as when t is in s.
11.2  Capacitor Charging
Consider next the case of an initially uncharged capaci-
tor connected through a resistor and a normally open 
switch to a battery of voltage VSRC (Figure 11.7a). The 
switch is closed at t = 0. At t = 0−, the capacitor voltage 
is zero, by assumption, and no energy is stored in the 
capacitor. At t = 0+, the stored energy and hence the volt-
age remain zero, because of the previously mentioned 
fundamental concept that the stored energy cannot be 
changed instantaneously by any physically realizable 
means. Terminal ‘b’ of the resistor is therefore at 0  V, 
with respect to ground at t = 0+, whereas terminal ‘a’ 
is connected to the battery and is at a voltage VSRC with 
respect to ground. The voltage across RC is VSRC, causing 
a current VSRC/RC to flow through the resistor and the 
capacitor at t = 0+. Note that the uncharged capacitor 
acts as a short circuit at the instant of switching, since the 
voltage across it is zero at this instant, while the capaci-
tor current is VSRC/RC.
The flow of current through the resistor charges the 
capacitor, increasing vC, the voltage across the capacitor 
(Figure 11.7b). However, as vC increases, the voltage across 
the resistor decreases, because vC + vR = VSRC is constant 
so that the current i decreases. Eventually, the capacitor 
charges to VSRC, and i drops to zero. The capacitor now 
acts as an open circuit in the steady state. It is required to 
determine how vC and i vary with time for t ≥ 0+.
Since the circuit is a series circuit, KCL is automati-
cally satisfied. At any time t, KVL in Figure 11.7b gives 
vC + vR = VSRC. Substituting for vC in terms of the integral 
form of the v–i relation for the capacitor and for vR in 
terms of Om’s law,

Note that the v–i relation for the capacitor is written

with respect to time, the RHS becomes zero, since VSRC 
is a constant. Dividing the LHS by R and substituting

i therefore decays exponentially, as in Figure 11.2, 
from an initial value of I0 = VSRC/RC at t = 0+ to zero as

where VCF = VSRC = vC(∞) is the final value of vC and 
vC(0+)  =  0. Equation 11.17 is plotted in Figure 11.8 in 
normalized form as vC/VCF vs. t/τ. The response is 
a “saturating” exponential that starts from zero and 
approaches unity as t → ∞. At t = τ, the response is (1 – 
1/e) or approximately 63.2% of its final value. Another 
interpretation of τ is that if the response increases lin-
early at its maximum initial value, it will reach the final 
value at t = τ. This can be demonstrated by differentiat-
ing Equation 11.17, which gives

This means that v/VCF = 1 at t/τ = 1 or v = VCF at t = τ.
The exponential variation of vC again follows from 
the argument that as vC increases, its rate of increase is 
reduced as a linear function of vC itself. Thus, the rate of 
increase of vC is dvC/dt = i/C. But i = (VSRC – vC)/RC so 
that as vC increases, i decreases and the rate of increase 
of vC also decreases as a linear function of vC.
Note that as t → ∞, the energy dissipated in the resis-
tor is equal to that stored in the capacitor (Problem 
P11.58).
11.2.1  Charging with Initial Energy Storage
Suppose the capacitor in Figure 11.7 is initially charged 
to a voltage V0 < VSRC. The initial value of the current 
is (VSRC – V0)/RC instead of VSRC/RC for an initially 
uncharged capacitor. Equation 11.15 becomes

Thus, vC(0+) = V0 and vC(∞) = VCF, as required.
It is instructive to derive Equations 11.19 and 11.20 
from superposition, since the circuit is LTI. According 
to the principle of superposition, the total response 
is the algebraic sum of the response to the excitation 
applied to an uncharged capacitor and the response 
due to a charged capacitor with the excitation set to 
zero. Considering i first, Equation 11.15 applies to the 
response when the capacitor is charged from an initially 
uncharged state. When the capacitor is initially charged 
and the battery is replaced by a short circuit, the capaci-
tor discharges, as in Figure 11.1b. The discharge current 
is given by Equation 11.10, but the direction of the dis-
charge current is opposite to that of i in Figure 11.7b. 
Hence, the current in Equation 11.10, with I0 = V0/RC, 
should be subtracted from that given by Equation 11.15.

which is the same as Equation 11.19. Similarly, vC in this

Concept: The responses in an LTI circuit, with initial energy 
storage, to an applied excitation can be derived as the alge-
braic sum of two responses: (i) the response to the applied exci-
tation acting alone, with zero initial energy storage, and (ii) 
the response to the initial energy storage acting alone, with 
zero applied excitation.

Example 11.2:  Capacitor Charging by Current Source
A dc current source ISRC is applied at t = 0 to an uncharged 
capacitor C in parallel with a resistor RC (Figure 11.9a). It 
is required to determine how v across the parallel com-
bination, iR and iC, vary with time for t ≥ 0+ (Figure 11.9b).
Solution:
At t = 0−, the stored energy in C is zero, since the voltage 
across C is zero, because of the closed switch. At t = 0+, 
this energy and hence v remain zero. v = 0 means iR = 0 
so that all of ISRC initially flows in C. C acts as a short 
circuit at this instant since the voltage across it is zero, 
while the current through it is ISRC. C begins to charge, 
increasing v. As v increases, iR increases in accordance 
with Ohm’s law. This reduces iC because iC + iR = ISRC is 
constant. Eventually, C charges fully, iC drops to zero, 
and all of ISRC flows through RC. C acts as an open circuit, 
which means that the final value of v is VCF = RCISRC.
To analyze the circuit, we note that KVL is automati-
cally satisfied in Figure 11.9b, because of the parallel con-
nection. KCL gives iC + iR = ISRC. Substituting iC = Cdv/dt

to this equation is discussed in detail in Section 11.5, 
where it is argued that the solution is the sum of two 
components: (1) v that is the solution to the homoge-
neous differential equation and (2) any v that satisfies 
Equation 11.22. In particular, as t → ∞, steady conditions 
prevail so that dv/dt = 0 and VCF = (τC/C)ISRC = RCISRC, as 
argued previously. The first component of the solution 
is given by Equation 11.6, with an arbitrary constant A.

This is a saturating exponential of zero initial value

How will v change with time if C is charged to a voltage

the capacitor is 1 2

V0, remains the same, since the stored energy cannot be 
changed instantaneously by any physically realizable 
means. At this instant, iR = V0/RC so that iC = ISRC – V0/RC. 
As t → ∞, C charges fully, iC = 0, ISRC flows though RC, 
and the final voltage is RCISRC, irrespective of V0. The 
analytical solution is obtained from the general solution 
(Equation 11.23) but substituting the initial condition 
that v = V0 at t = 0. This gives A = V0 – RCISRC so that

The current values at the two limits are in agreement with 
those argued previously. Note that iC + iR = ISRC for all t.
Equations 11.25 through 11.27 can be derived from 
superposition. Thus, with the excitation applied alone, 
v is given by Equation 11.24. When the initial energy 
storage is applied alone, with ISRC in Figure 11.9b set to 
zero, that is, the ideal source replaced by an open circuit, 
v is given by Equation 11.9. Adding the two responses 
gives Equation 11.25, bearing in mind that VCF = RCISRC. 
Similar considerations apply to iR and iC (Exercise 11.9).

PSpice considers a dc source applied at t  =  0, at the

the simulation is run, the plots shown in Figure 11.11 are 
displayed, which shows the time variation of v, iR, and iC 
in accordance with Equations 11.28 through 11.30. Note 
that in the three plots, a tangent at t = 0 intersects the

11.3  Inductor Discharge
In the circuit of Figure 11.13a, a dc current source is con-
nected to RL and L through a normally closed switch that is 
opened at t = 0. The switch is assumed to have been closed 
for a long time so that at t = 0−, steady conditions prevail. 
This means that the inductor acts as a short circuit so that 
the current ISRC flows through the inductor, with zero 
voltage across the paralleled circuit elements. RD ensures 
that after the switch is opened, the ideal current source is 
not left open-circuited, as this would result in a theoreti-
cally infinite voltage across the source (Section 3.6).
At t  =  0−, the current in the inductor is ISRC, as in 
Figure 11.13a, and the energy stored in the inductor is 
1 2
2
/
(
)LISRC. At t = 0+, the inductor current remains ISRC 
because the stored energy cannot be changed instanta-
neously by any physically realizable means. The circuit 
reduces to that of Figure 11.13b for t ≥ 0+, with the posi-
tive directions of i and v assigned as shown and with i 
having an initial value I0 = ISRC at t = 0+. It is required to 
determine how i and v vary with time for t ≥ 0+.
That i decreases from its initial value of ISRC is evident 
from energy considerations. i flowing through RL dis-
sipates energy, which can only come from the energy 
stored in the inductor. As energy continues to be dissi-
pated in RL, i decreases until all the initially stored energy 
is dissipated so that i and v eventually become zero.
Choosing i as the variable for analysis is tantamount to 
considering the circuit of Figure 11.13b as a series circuit, 
so KCL is automatically satisfied. In terms of i, the voltage 
drop across the resistor is RLi in the direction of i, whereas

where τL = L/RL is the time constant and the initial con-
ditions are i(0+) = I0 = ISRC and v = RLISRC at t = 0+. Note 
that Equation 11.31 is the dual relation of Equation 11.2. 
It can be derived from Equation 11.2 by replacing v with i 
and τC = RCC with τL = L/RL, where L is the dual of C and 
GL = 1/RL is the dual of RC. The series circuit of Figure 11.13b 
is the dual of the parallel circuit of Figure 11.1b.

where
i(0+) = I0 = ISRC
v(0+) = V0 = RLISRC
i(∞)  =  v(∞)  =  0, as the energy initially stored in the 
inductor is dissipated in the resistor (Problem P11.57). 
Both the current and the voltage decay exponentially.
It is instructive to interpret the decay of i and v in 
terms of flux linkage. Suppose that iSRC in Figure 11.14a 
increases, during t ≤ 0−, while the switch is closed, from 
zero to a steady value I0  =  ISRC in some manner that 
need not be specified. The induced voltage v′ opposes 
the buildup of current through the inductor by being 
a voltage drop in the direction of current through the 
inductor (Figure 11.14a). Hence, for t  ≤  0−, v′ varies 
with time in some arbitrary manner, as illustrated in 
Figure 11.14b. λ in the inductor is equal to the area under 
the v′ vs. t graph. Eventually at t = 0−, the circuit is in a 
steady state, the current in the inductor is I0, v′ = 0, and 
the flux linkage λ0 = LISRC is the area under the graph 
of v vs. t for t ≤ 0−.
At t = 0+, v = RLI0. Since the polarity of v across the 
inductor is now opposite to that of v′ during the estab-
lishment of I0, the time integral of v, t ≥ 0+, is a flux 
linkage òvdt that subtracts from λ0. At any time t, λ is 
(Figure 11.14c).

At t = 0+, λ = λ0 = LI0. As t → ∞, λ = 0. Dividing λ(t) 
in Equation 11.34 by L gives i(t) in Equation 11.32. Note 
that λ is the dual of q, the charge on the capacitor in 
Figure 11.1b.

(11.35)
Since the rate of decrease of i is proportional to i, the 
decay of i is exponential. v, being proportional to i, will 
also decay exponentially.
It must not be construed, because the initial current 
I0, due to flow of electric charges, eventually decays 
to zero that charge is not being conserved. Recall that 
a current source excites a circuit by imparting kinetic 
energy to electric charges, and that current is the rate 
of flow of electric charge. Hence, as the inductor dis-
charges, the charges loose kinetic energy, without any 
loss of charge.

11.4  Inductor Charging
In Figure 11.17, a dc current source ISRC is connected in 
parallel with L and RL. For t ≤ 0−, ISRC flows through a nor-
mally closed switch connected across the parallel combi-
nation. The current in RL and L and the voltage across the 
combination are all zero. The switch is opened at t = 0.
At t = 0+, the energy in the inductor, and hence the 
inductor current, remains zero. This means that ISRC 
flows through RL so that v = RLISRC at this instant. Note 
that the inductor acts as an open circuit at the instant of 
switching, since its current is zero, while the voltage v 
across it jumps from 0 to RLISRC. The time integral of v, the 
flux linkage λ, increases with time, as does the inductor 
current iL = λ/L. But as iL increases, iR decreases, because 
iL + iR = ISRC is constant, which means that v decreases. 
Eventually as t → ∞, v, and hence iR, goes to zero. All of 
ISRC flows through L, and the inductor behaves as a short 
circuit in the final steady state. It is required to deter-
mine how v and iL vary with time.
With KVL automatically satisfied by the assign-
ment of v across the parallel elements, KCL gives 
iL + iR = ISRC. Substituting for iL in terms of the integral 
form of the v–i relation for the inductor and for iR in

where iL(∞) = ILF = ISRC. Equation 11.40 satisfies the ini-
tial condition that iL(0+) = 0 and represents a saturating 
exponential, as in Figure 11.8.
The exponential variation again follows from the 
argument that the rate of change of the variables at a 
given instant is proportional to the variable itself at 
that instant. Considering v, its rate of decrease is, from 
Equation 11.37, −dv/dt = v/τL, which is proportional to v. 
Since v changes exponentially, so will the currents.
What if in Figure 11.17 the inductor had an initial 
current I0? In this case the initial value of the voltage 
is RL(ISRC – I0) instead of RLISRC. Equation 11.38 becomes

Equations 11.41 and 11.42 can be derived from super-
position, since the circuit is LTI. Considering v, Equation 
11.38 applies to the response when the inductor is 
initially uncharged. Figure 11.13b applies to the cur-
rent through the inductor acting alone, with the current 
source replaced by an open circuit. However, the direc-
tion of the discharge current through RL is opposite 
to iR in Figure 11.17b so that the response given by 
Equation 11.33 should be subtracted from that given by 
Equation 11.38. This gives.

Example 11.4:  Inductor Charging by Voltage Source
A battery voltage VSRC is applied at t = 0 to an uncharged 
inductor L in series with a resistor RL (Figure 11.18a). It 
is required to determine how i, vR, and vL vary with time 
(Figure 11.18b).
Solution:
At t = 0−, the stored energy in the uncharged L is zero, 
by assumption. At t = 0+, this energy remains zero. This 
implies that i = 0 and vR = 0 so that all of VSRC initially 
appears across L, which therefore acts as an open cir-
cuit. The time integral of vL, which is the flux linkage λ, 
increases with time, as does i = λ/L. As i increases, vR 
increases in accordance with Ohm’s law. This reduces vL, 
because vL + vR = VSRC is constant. Eventually, L charges 
fully, vL drops to zero, and all of VSRC appears across RL, 
with L acting as a short circuit. The final value of i is 
­therefore i(∞) = IF = VSRC/RL.
From KVL, vL + vR = VSRC. Substituting vL = Ldi/dt and 
vR = RLi,

As in Example 11.2, the general solution is the sum of 
two components: (1) i that is the solution of the homo-
geneous differential equation and (2) any i that satisfies 
the nonhomogeneous differential Equation 11.45. In par-
ticular, as t → ∞, steady state conditions prevail so that 
di/dt = 0 and IF = (τ/L)VS = VSRC/RL as argued previously. 
The first component is given by Equation 11.6, with an

This is a saturating exponential of zero initial value and

that vL = VSRC – RLI0. Eventually, L charges fully, vL = 0, VSRC 
appears across RL, and the final current is IF = VSRC/RL, irre-
spective of I0. The analytical solution is obtained from the 
general solution (Equation 11.46) by substituting the initial 
condition that i(0+) = I0. This gives A = I0 – VSRC/RL so that

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Duality should be noted. The circuit in Figure 11.18 
is the dual of that in Figure 11.9 when R in one circuit 
is replaced by G in the other circuit. Equations  11.44 
through 11.53 are the duals of Equations 11.21 
through  11.30 when the following are interchanged: 
VSRC and ISRC, v and i, vR and iR, vL and iC, L and C, and RC 
and GL = 1/RL. The numerical values in this example are 
the duals of those in Example 11.2.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 11.19. The 
source VDC applies a voltage of 5 V at t = 0, at the start of the 
simulation, so no switch is needed. A differential marker is 
used to display the voltage across the 0.5 Ω resistor.
In the Simulation Settings, ‘Analysis type’ is ‘Time 
Domain (Transient),’ ‘Run to time’ is 30 m, ‘Start Saving 
Data After’ is 0, and ‘Maximum Step size’ is 1u. After 
the simulation is run, the plot is as shown in Figure 11.1 
for the dual quantities, that is, i replaces v, vR replaces iR, 
and vL replaces iC.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Always check the correctness of a derived response 
for current or voltage as a function of time by 
determining the values at t = 0 and as t → ∞ and 
by satisfying KVL and KCL.
•	 Duality can be helpful in checking the correctness 
of assumptions and expressions.
Exercise 11.13
Transform the voltage source VSRC in series with RL in 
Figure 11.18 to a current source ISRC = VSRC/RL in parallel 
with RL. Verify that vL and the inductor current are given 
by the same expressions.
Exercise 11.14
Derive i, vR, and vL (Equations 11.48 through 11.50) using 
superposition.
Primal Exercise 11.15
The switch in Figure 11.20 is opened at t = 0, after being 
closed for a long time. The switch is closed again after 
1 ms. Determine iL at t = 2 ms. Assume that the conduc-
tance of RD is much less than 2 kS so it can be neglected.

11.5  Generalized First-Order Circuits
The first-order circuits discussed so far were basic, pro-
totypical, LTI circuits consisting of a single resistor and 
a single energy storage element. First-order circuits, 
however, can be more complex, consisting of more than 
a single resistor, capacitor, or inductor, and can include 
dependent sources. Nevertheless, for a circuit to be first 
order, it must be an LTI circuit that is reducible to one of 
the prototypical circuits that have a single ideal capacitor or 
a single ideal inductor, in combination with a single resis-
tor. For example, the circuit of Figure 11.21 includes 
two capacitors that cannot be combined into a single 
ideal capacitor. The circuit therefore is not first order. 
But in the absence of the 4 Ω resistor, the two capaci-
tors combine into a single 1.25 F capacitor in series with 
a 1 Ω resistor, which is a first-order circuit. It may be 
argued that the 4 Ω resistor and 0.25 F capacitor can be 
converted to an equivalent resistor in parallel with an 
equivalent capacitor that can then be combined with the 
1 F capacitor, resulting in a first-order circuit. However, 
the equivalent resistance and capacitance are functions 
of frequency (Exercise 11.16). The equivalent parallel

an ideal capacitor is a constant that is independent of 
frequency.

11.5.1  Generalized Response
Any natural response of a first-order circuit, or the 
response to a dc excitation, obeys a first-order differen-
tial equation of the form

(11.54)
where
y is the voltage or current under consideration
K is zero for a natural response or a constant in the 
case of a dc excitation. Thus, K = 0 in Equations 11.2 
and 11.31, whereas K = ISRC/C in Equation 11.22 and 
K = VSRC/L in Equation 11.45.
The general solution of Equation 11.54 is the sum of two 
components:
	
1.	A component that is the solution of the homo-
geneous differential equation. This component 
is of the form of Equation 11.7, including an 
arbitrary constant of integration. It is termed 
the complementary function in mathematics 
and the transient response in circuit analysis, 
because it decays with time in a stable circuit. 
The time course of the transient is that of the 
natural response, and the role of the transient is 
explained in Section 11.6.
	
2.	A component that satisfies the nonhomoge-
neous differential equation. This component 
is the particular integral in mathematics and 
the final, steady-state response in circuit anal-
ysis. As its name implies, it is the value of the 
variable as t → ∞. When K is a constant, the 
steady-state, final value YF is obtained from 
Equation 11.54 by setting dy/dt  =  0, which 
gives YF = Kτ.

That Equation 11.55 is the general solution of 
Equation  11.54 is evidenced by (1) satisfying Equation 
11.54, as can be readily verified by substitution, and 
(2) having an arbitrary constant of integration, A, which 
can be found from initial conditions in the circuit. Thus, if 
y = Y0 at t = 0, it follows from Equation 11.55 that

It must be emphasized that the initial conditions are 
applied to the complete solution (Equation 11.55) and 
not to the transient component of the solution alone.
All the currents and voltages derived in the preceding 
sections are of the form of Equation 11.57, with various 
values for Y0, YF, and τ.
The attractive feature of Equation 11.57 is that it gives 
y(t) without having to derive and solve the differential 
equation for y. It suffices to determine Y0, YF, and τ, which 
can be done directly from the circuit, as discussed in 
what follows. It must also be emphasized that Equation 
11.57 applies only when the RHS of Equation 11.54 is 
zero or a constant, that is, the desired response is a 
natural response, with zero applied excitation, or is the 
response to a dc excitation. Equation 11.57 does not apply 
when the excitation is time varying.
The homogeneous differential equation (Equation 11.54 
with K = 0) is a very basic attribute of any circuit. The fol-
lowing features of this equation and their implications 
should be carefully noted:
	
1.	Independent sources appear in the nonhomoge-
neous differential equation, but not in the homo-
geneous differential equation, which implies 
that the homogeneous differential equation can just as 
well be derived with independent sources set to zero. 
Thus, the homogeneous differential equation of 
v in Figure 11.9, which is Equation  11.22 with 
zero on the RHS, can be derived from Figure 11.9 
with ISRC set to zero. Similarly, the homogeneous 
differential equation of i in Figure 11.18, which 
is Equation 11.45 with zero on the RHS, can be 
derived from Figure 11.18 with VSRC set to zero 
(Exercise 11.17).
	
2.	In the standard form of the homogeneous 
differential equation of a first-order circuit 

312	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
(Equation 11.54), the coefficient of the dy/dt 
term is unity and the coefficient of the y term is 
the reciprocal of the time constant. A first-order 
homogeneous differential equation is therefore 
completely determined by the time constant τ. 
In turn, τ = CR or L/R, irrespective of indepen-
dent sources, which means that τ can be deter-
mined with independent sources set to zero. 
Accordingly, τ is the same for the charging of a 
capacitor from a voltage source VSRC (Equation 
11.19) as for its discharging, with VSRC  =  0 
(Equation 11.10), similarly for an inductor.
	
3.	The solution of the homogeneous differen-
tial equation contains the arbitrary constant 
and the exponent in terms of τ. As explained 
in Section  8.1, all voltages and currents in an 
LTI circuit are related by linear operations. All 
these operations do not affect the exponent in 
the expressions for the voltages and currents. It 
follows from the preceding two items ‘1’ and ‘2’ 
that all voltages and currents have the same τ 
and therefore obey the same homogeneous dif-
ferential equation. They differ only in the val-
ues of the arbitrary constant and of the final 
steady state.
Exercise 11.17
Verify that the homogeneous differential equation 
(Equation 11.22) can be derived from Figure 11.9 with 
ISRC = 0 and that the homogeneous differential equation 
(Equation 11.45) can be derived from Figure 11.18 with 
VSRC = 0.
11.5.2  Determining Initial and Final Values
Y0 and YF can be determined by any of the circuit tech-
niques discussed so far in this book, bearing in mind the 
following basic considerations:
	
1.	In the steady state, inductors act as short circuits 
and capacitors as open circuits.
	
2.	When a sudden change is made at t  =  0 in a 
circuit containing energy storage elements, 
the voltage across a capacitor and the current 
through an inductor remain the same at t = 0+, 
because the stored energy cannot be changed 
instantaneously by any physically realizable 
means.
	
3.	The voltages and currents at t = 0+ are the initial 
values used in determining the arbitrary con-
stant in the general solution of the differential 
equation for a given voltage or current.
	
4.	However, the current through a capacitor and the 
voltage across an inductor are not directly related 
to stored energy and can therefore change instanta-
neously to satisfy KCL or KVL.
	
5.	When energy storage elements are charged 
through a sudden change, an uncharged capaci-
tor acts as a short circuit, and an uncharged 
inductor acts as an open circuit.
	
6.	If the capacitor or inductor is initially charged, 
the preceding procedure is applied assuming 
no initial energy storage. The effect of the initial 
energy storage, acting alone, can then be added 
algebraically by superposition.
Note that Y0 and YF in the circuits considered in this 
chapter are either zero or dc values of current or voltage. 
Such values are independent of L and C, since under dc 
conditions, inductors act as short circuits and capacitors 
as open circuits.
11.5.3  Effect of Sources on Time Constant
A physical interpretation can be given for τ not being 
affected by independent dc sources: during charging or 
discharging of energy storage elements, currents and 
voltages change with time. If the current through an 
ideal, independent dc voltage source varies by ΔiSRC, the 
source voltage does not vary, by definition of an ideal, 
independent voltage source. This also follows from the 
fact that the source resistance of an ideal voltage source 
is zero so that ΔvSRC = 0 × ΔiSRC = 0. Since ΔiSRC produces 
no change in voltage across the dc voltage source, the 
source appears as a short circuit as far as the changing 
current is concerned. Similarly, if the voltage across an 
ideal, independent dc current source changes by ΔvSRC, 
the source current does not change. Hence, the source 
appears as an open circuit as far as the changing volt-
age is concerned. The effective time constant is therefore 
determined with ideal, independent voltage sources 
replaced by short circuits and ideal, independent cur-
rent sources by open circuits.
The time constant is formally derived as the resistance 
seen by the energy storage element in a first-order circuit. 
This is illustrated in Figure 11.22a, in which the energy

storage element is shown, separated from the rest of the 
circuit at terminals ‘ab’ of the energy storage element. The 
rest of the circuit can be represented by its Thevenin’s 
equivalent circuit (TEC) as seen by the energy storage ele-
ment (Figure 11.22b). Since independent sources can be 
set to zero when determining the time constant, VTh = 0. 
The resistance that combines with the circuit parameter of the 
energy storage element to determine the time constant is RTh. 
That is, the time constant is RThC in the case of a capacitor 
and L/RTh in the case of an inductor.
The foregoing can be illustrated by the circuit of 
Figure 11.23, where C is assumed to have an initial volt-
age V0 at t = 0−. It is required to determine v and iC for 
t ≥ 0+, after the switch is closed at t = 0. The circuit can 
be reduced to a prototypical, series RC circuit by deriv-
ing TEC seen by the capacitor. This will be done in two 
easy steps. The first is to derive TEC for the circuit to 
the left of Rp in Figure 11.23, as shown in Figure 11.24a. 
When terminals ‘ab’ are open-circuited, the current 
(ρ + 1)IS = 0, which means that IS = 0, since ρ can have, 
in general , any value. The current source is replaced by 
an open circuit and no current flows in RS. It follows that 
VTh = VSRC. When terminals ‘ab’ are short-circuited, the 
current that flows in the short circuit is ISC = (ρ + 1)IS, 
where IS = VSRC/RS. This gives ISC = (ρ + 1)VSRC/RS and

Y0 is the initial value at t = 0+, after the change in 
the circuit takes place
YF is the final, steady-state value
τ is the time constant
	
	 Y0, YF, and τ can be determined directly from the 
­circuit. It is important to note that Y0 for any given 
voltage or current in the circuit is determined by the 
constancy of capacitor voltages and inductor cur-
rents. One cannot assume that variables other than 
these remain constant at the instant of switching. 
This is illustrated by Example 11.6.
	
2.	τ can be determined from Thevenin’s resistance seen 
by C or L and is the same for all currents and volt-
ages in the circuit.
	
3.	Both independent and dependent sources affect the 
initial and steady-state, final values of currents or 
voltages in a first-order ­circuit. Dependent sources, 
but not independent sources, affect the time constant 
so that independent sources can be set to zero when 
determining the time constant.
	
4.	Initial and steady-state, final values of currents and 
voltages are independent of C or L.
Exercise 11.18
Verify that the same expressions for v and iC in Figure 11.23 
can be obtained by solving the differential equations sat-
isfied by these variables.
11.5.4  Effective Values of Circuit Elements
If a first-order circuit contains more than one resistor 
and more than one capacitor or inductor, with or with-
out dependent sources, then the circuit should be reduc-
ible to a single effective resistor and a single effective 
capacitor or inductor, with or without an independent 
source. Otherwise, the circuit is not first order, as in the 
case of the circuit of Figure 11.21.
In Figure 11.26a, for example, the three inductors can 
be combined into a single inductor, Leff, and the three 
resistors can be combined into a single resistor Reff, where

and
	 (11.62)
The circuit reduces to a prototypical circuit consisting 
of a voltage source applied to a series combination of 
Leff and Reff (Figure 11.26b).
As demonstrated in previous chapters, dependent 
sources generally alter the coefficients multiplying cur-
rents and voltages in circuit equations. They will generally 
affect the effective values of resistance, capacitance, and 
inductance and hence initial values, final values, and the 
time constant.
Primal Exercise 11.19
(a) Assume that in Figure 11.26, L1 = 5 μH, L2 = 3 μH, 
L3 = 2 μH, R1 = 8 kΩ, R2 = 6 kΩ, and R3 = 2 kΩ. Determine 
Leff, Reff, and τeff. (b) Repeat (a) if the inductors are 
replaced by capacitors having the same numerical val-
ues in microfarads.
Ans. (a) Leff  =  2.5  μH, Reff  =  4 kΩ, τeff  =  0.625  ns; (b)

value IL0 is that which applies at t  =  0+. But because 
the stored energy cannot change instantaneously, 
iL(0+) = iL(0−), where iL(0−) = IL0 is the steady-state value 
with the switch open, which means that the inductor 
acts as a short circuit (Figure 11.28). From current divi-
sion, Iϕ0 = 20 × 3/4 = 15 mA. IL0 = Iϕ0 + Vϕ0/3, where Vϕ0 = 
(Iϕ0 mA) × (1 kΩ). It follows that IL0 = (4/3)Iϕ0 = 20 mA.
When the switch is closed, the 66  V source and the 
6 kΩ resistor are added to the circuit. This combination 
can be transformed to its equivalent current source, 
the circuit to the right of the 1 kΩ resistor becom-
ing as shown in Figure 11.29. The two current sources 
can be combined into a 9 mA current source, directed 
upward, in parallel with 6∥3 kΩ, which is 2 kΩ. In the 
steady state, the inductor is again a short circuit so that 
the circuit becomes as in Figure 11.28 but with the new 
source values (Figure  11.30). From current division, 
IϕF = 9 × 2/3 = 6 mA. This gives ILF = (4/3)IϕF = 8 mA.
To determine the time constant, we note that the resis-
tance seen by the inductor is Thevenin’s resistance to the 
right of the inductor terminals. The short-circuit current 
between these terminals is ILF = 8 mA, as has just been 
determined. When the inductor is replaced by an open 
circuit (Figure 11.31), VϕF/1 + VϕF/3 = 0 so that VϕF = 0 
and IϕF = 0. It follows that VTh is the voltage that appears 
across the 2 kΩ resistor, which is (9 mA) × (2 kΩ) = 18 V. 
RTh = 18/8 = 2.25 kΩ. The time constant is τ = L/R = 18 mH/
(2.25 kΩ) = 18 × 10−3/(2.25 × 103) = 8 × 10−6 s ≡ 8 μs. From

When the simulation is started at t = 0, with zero initial

source at t = 0, so sufficient time must be allowed for the 
circuit to reach a steady state before the switch is closed.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
In Figure 11.32, the switch is closed at t = 50 μs. Since we 
are not interested in iL prior to closing the switch, 50u 
is entered for ‘Start saving data after’ in the Simulation 
Settings. The other entries in the Simulation Settings are 
‘Time Domain (Transient)’ for ‘Analysis type,’ 80u for 
‘Run to time,’ and 1n for ‘Maximum Step size’. A default 
time of 1 μs is allowed in PSpice for the switch to close, 
which means that closure will actually occur at 51 μs. 
To have closure occur more nearly at 50 μs, the default 
value for TTRAN is changed to 1n in the Property Editor 
spreadsheet of the switch. After the simulation is run, 
the plot for iL is displayed as in Figure 11.33.
Alternatively, the initial steady-state current in the 
inductor can be calculated and entered as the IC value. 
Or zero is entered for ‘Start saving data after’ and both 
the buildup and decay of iL displayed. This would also 
allow confirmation that a steady state is reached before 
the switch is closed.
Example 11.6:  Jump in Voltage upon Switching
The switch is closed at t = 0 in Figure 11.34 after being 
open for a long time. It is required to determine vX(t) 
for t ≥ 0+.
Solution:
When the switch has been open for a long time, the induc-
tor acts as a short circuit. The circuit reduces to that shown 
in Figure 11.35. (12∥6) = 4 Ω. The current in the 4 Ω resis-
tor is 12/(4 + 4) = 1.5 A, and iL(0−) = IL0 = 1.5 × 12/18 = 1 A; 
vX(0−) = 4 × 1.5 = 6 V.
At t = 0+, with the switch closed, the circuit becomes 
as in Figure 11.36. The 24 Ω resistor is in parallel with 
the 12 Ω resistor so that (12∥24) = 8 Ω; i(0+) = IL0 = 1 A, 
from the constancy of stored energy. From KCL,

that vX jumps at t = 0 from 6 V to 20/3 V. It is the latter 
value that should be used as the initial value of vX for 
t ≥ 0+, based on the constancy of iL. As t → ∞, the induc-
tor acts as a short circuit, and VXF = 12 V. The resistance

jumps at t = 0 from 6 to 6.6667 V, and τ = 3 s.
★Example 11.7:  Analysis of Repetitive Response
A nonlinear “threshold” device D is connected across 
the capacitor in Figure 11.39. The device changes its 
resistance R abruptly once the increasing voltage vC 
reaches a certain level or threshold. It is assumed that R 
is infinite for 0 < vC < 3 V, while the capacitor is charging. 
When vC = 3 V, R becomes zero, instantly discharging 
the capacitor, and immediately becomes infinite again 
when the capacitor is discharged. The capacitor starts 
charging again, and the cycle is repeated. vC is therefore a 
periodic waveform that repeats at a certain frequency, as 
illustrated by the solid-line in Figure 11.40. It is required 
to determine the frequency of oscillation. This type of 
oscillator, based on a nonlinear element, such as D, that 
repetitively charges and discharges an energy storage 
element is referred to as a relaxation oscillator.
Solution:
Let t = 0 be the time when the capacitor is fully discharged 
and R becomes infinite. For t ≥ 0, the capacitor charges 
toward 6  V with t =

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
This problem illustrates some interesting and impor-
tant points concerning the analysis and behavior of 
­electric circuits:
1.	 It was repeatedly stressed in this chapter that 
the voltage across a capacitor cannot be changed 
instantaneously by any physically realizable 
means. Yet it is assumed in Figure 11.40 that device 
D instantly discharges C. Does this mean that the 
instantaneous discharge depicted in Figure  11.40 
is not physically realizable? The answer is yes. 
Theoretically, C can be discharged instantaneously 
by a current impulse, which is discussed in detail in 
Chapter 18. The impulse function is not physically 
realizable, being a purely mathematical construct 
that is nevertheless extremely useful and impor-
tant in the analysis of signals and systems, as dem-
onstrated in Chapters 18 through 23.
2.	 If the assumption of instantaneous discharge of C is 
not physically realizable, are we justified in consider-
ing it? The answer is emphatically yes. The reason is 
that such assumptions provide an easy way of deter-
mining the limiting behavior of the circuit. The fre-
quency fC derived earlier is the highest theoretically 
possible frequency of oscillation for the circuit of 
Figure 11.39, for the assumed values of battery volt-
age, R, C, and threshold level. In practice, the resis-
tance of device D when it discharges the capacitor is 
small and nonlinear. But it can only prolong the time 
of discharge and hence reduce fC. Even analyzing 
the circuit assuming that R is small and linear com-
plicates the analysis considerably (Problem P11.59). 
Assuming R = 0 when R discharges C greatly simpli-
fies the analysis and provides a first approximation 
to the behavior of the circuit. Such an assumption is 
an extremely useful first step in designing a practical 
circuit, so this approach is extensively used in engi-
neering design. The analysis can be subsequently 
refined as in Problem P11.59, leading to a final design 
that is usually completed through simulation, tak-
ing into account such practical considerations as the 
behavior of device D according to its manufacturer’s 
data sheet, manufacturing tolerances of values of R 
and C, the effect of the drop in battery voltage with 
use, the effect of temperature variation, etc.
3.	 It should be carefully noted that in Figure 11.40, C 
charges toward a steady-state value of 6 V, the bat-
tery voltage, and not to 3  V, the threshold level. 
Fundamentally, the reason is that physical systems 
“operating in real time” are “causal”. Operation in 
real time means that the system response unfolds 
for the first time as the current time progresses. 
This is in contrast to a recorded signal that was cap-
tured at an earlier time and is being replayed later. 
At any instant of the recording, the future response 
is already available. For example, a football game 
that is being watched “live” is being watched in real 
time. The action in the game unfolds for the first time 
as the current time progresses. On the other hand, 
when a recorded game is watched, any future out-
come, such as the final score, is available at any time. 
By causal is meant that the system cannot anticipate 
what is going to happen in the future. This is true 
when one is watching the football game in real time. 
One cannot tell for sure what might happen next. 
In the same manner, the capacitor in Figure 11.40 
cannot anticipate that it is going to be discharged 
when vC reaches 3 V. An associated attribute of this 
behavior is that the system is “memoryless” in the 
sense that even if it is discharged at 3 V in one cycle, 
it does not remember this in the next cycle. The con-
sequence of being causal and memoryless is that the 
capacitor charges in every cycle in normal fashion 
toward a final value of 6 V.
4.	 How about the nature of device D? D could be a sim-
ple neon lamp that acts as an open circuit at low volt-
ages, without emitting light. When the voltage across 
the lamp reaches a certain threshold level, usually 
about few tens of volts, the gas in the lamp breaks 
down, an arc is struck between the two electrodes of 
the lamp, light is emitted by the arc, and the resis-
tance across the lamp falls to a low value, thereby dis-
charging the capacitor. When vC falls to a low enough 
level, the arc is extinguished, and the lamp reverts to 
the open-circuit state. The result is a “light flasher” 
at a suitable frequency (Problems P11.33 and P11.59). 
Alternatively, D could be a threshold electronic cir-
cuit that produces some signal when its threshold is 
reached. If a switch is inserted in series with R, the 
circuit can act as a simple “timer” that produces a 
signal when the threshold is reached at a preset time 
after the switch is closed. The time can be varied by 
varying R or C (Problem P11.52).
5.	 A variation of the circuit of Figure 11.39 is a pho-
toflash unit in which C is connected through a 
changeover switch, as in Figure 11.41. In one posi-
tion of the switch, C is charged to VSRC. When the 
switch is moved, the low-resistance flash lamp is 
connected across C. The large discharge current 
rapidly discharges C and produces an intense flash.

11.6  Role of Transient
It was emphasized throughout this chapter that stored 
energy cannot be changed instantaneously by any physi-
cally realizable means. Since the energy stored in a capac-
itor is directly related to the voltage across the capacitor 
and the energy stored in an inductor is directly related to 
the current though the inductor, capacitor voltages and 
inductor currents cannot be changed instantaneously by 
any physically realizable means. So what if the steady-
state, final values of these circuit variables are different 
from the initial values, as they usually are? Evidently, 
there should be a smooth transition from the initial val-
ues to the steady-state, final values. This smooth transi-
tion is accomplished by the transient response.
Consider, for example, the case of a capacitor of initial 
voltage V0 being charged by a battery of voltage VSRC 
through a resistor R (Figure 11.42a). After the switch is 
closed and as t → ∞, the capacitor acts as an open circuit 
in the final steady state, so the final voltage across the 
capacitor is VSRC. The voltage across the capacitor at any 
time t ≥ 0+ is, from Equation 11.57,

v(0+) = V0 and v(∞) = VF = VSRC. The transition from 
V0 to VSRC is accomplished by the transient term, which 
is the second term on the RHS of Equation 11.63 and 
which contains the exponential. This term is shown in 
the lower trace of Figure 11.42b, assuming for the sake 
of argument that V0  <  VSRC. When added to VSRC, the 
total response is obtained, starting from V0 at t = 0+ and 
approaching VSRC as t → ∞. The time course of the tran-
sient is determined by the time constant in a first-order 
circuit. In the special case of V0 = VSRC, there is no tran-
sient response, because the final state is assumed from 
the very beginning at t = 0+.
The same role is played by the transient response in 
the cases of inductor charging as well as the discharging 
of a capacitor or an inductor. In the case of a capacitor 
discharging through the resistor, for example, the final 
voltage across the capacitor is zero. The total response of 
capacitor voltage is a transient response that takes this 
voltage from its initial value to its final value of zero. The 
time-varying components of all the responses discussed 
in Sections 11.1 through 11.4 are transient responses that 
take the circuit from the initial to the final state. In fact, 
this role of the transient response is perfectly general:
Concept: The transient response in a given circuit response 
provides a smooth transition from the initial value of the 
response to its steady-state, final value. This transition from 
the initial value to the final value cannot occur instanta-
neously because energy stored in energy storage elements can-
not be changed instantaneously by any physically ­realizable 
means. The time course of this transition in a first-order cir-
cuit is determined by the time constant.
Evidently, there is no transient in purely resistive 
circuits so that both resistor voltages and currents can 
change instantly from initial to final values. It may be 
wondered if this is a violation of the general principle 
enunciated in Section 11.1 that energy values cannot be 
changed instantaneously by any physically realizable 
means. The answer is, of course, no. It must be recog-
nized that when resistor voltages or currents change 
instantaneously, it is the power dissipated, p, that changes 
instantaneously, not the energy dissipated, w. These 
two quantities are related by p = dw/dt or dw = pdt. If 
p is finite and dt → 0, as between t = 0− and t = 0+, then 
dw = 0, that is, the energy dissipated does not change. The 
exception of infinite p implies infinite resistor voltages 
or currents, which are not physically realizable. Hence, 
the general principle of constancy of energy values at 
the instant of change, under physically realizable condi-
tions, is not violated.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 Energy, in general, including stored energy, can-
not be changed instantaneously by any physi-
cally realizable means, as this would require 
infinite driving forces, that is, infinite voltages 
or currents in the case of energy storage ele-
ments in electric circuits. Such infinite values 
are not physically realizable.
•	 The behavior of a first-order circuit is governed by 
a first-order, linear, ordinary, differential equation 
with constant coefficients. The general solution to 
this equation contains an arbitrary constant that is 
determined from the initial value at t = 0+ of the 
variable in the differential equation. Once this sub-
stitution is made, the response for t ≥ 0+ is obtained.
•	 The time constant of a first-order circuit is a 
measure of its speed of response. The larger the 
time constant, the slower or more “sluggish” 
the response is and conversely.
•	 The time constant is RC for a capacitive circuit 
and L/R for an inductive circuit.
•	 When energy storage elements are charged 
through a sudden change, an uncharged capaci-
tor acts as a short circuit and an uncharged 
inductor acts as an open circuit.
•	 The responses in an LTI circuit, with initial 
energy storage, to an applied excitation can be 
derived as the algebraic sum of two responses: 
(1) the response to the applied excitation act-
ing alone, with zero initial energy storage, 
and (2) the response to the initial energy stor-
age acting alone, with zero applied excitation.
•	 The general solution of a linear, ordinary, differ-
ential equation is the sum of two components: (1) 
a transient term, obtained from the solution of 
the homogeneous differential equation, and (2) a 
steady-state term that is the solution of the non-
homogeneous differential equation as t → ∞.
•	 The natural response of a first-order circuit, 
or  the response to a dc excitation, is of the 
form  y

/ ,
t
, where YF 
is the steady-state, final value of y and Y0 is its 
initial value. These values and the time constant τ 
can be determined directly from the circuit.
•	 The following are important features of the 
homogeneous differential equation of a first-
order circuit:
	
1.	 Independent sources do not appear in the 
homogeneous differential equation, which 
means that the equation can be derived with 
independent sources set to zero.
	
2.	 The homogeneous differential equation is 
completely determined by the time constant τ.
	
3.	 The same homogeneous differential equa-
tion applies to all voltage and current 
responses in the circuit. These responses 
have the same time constant, so they differ 
only in the values of the arbitrary constant 
and of the final and steady state.
•	 The voltages and currents at t = 0+ are the initial 
values used in determining the arbitrary con-
stant in the general solution of the differential 
equation for a given voltage or current.
•	 Although the voltage across a capacitor and the 
current through an inductor do not change at 
t = 0, because the stored energy cannot be changed 
instantaneously by any physically realizable 
means, other voltages or currents in the circuit, 
including the current through a capacitor and the 
voltage across an inductor, are not directly related 
to stored energy and can therefore change instan-
taneously to satisfy KCL or KVL.
•	 Both independent and dependent sources 
affect the initial and steady-state, final val-
ues of currents or voltages in a first-order cir-
cuit. Dependent sources, but not independent 
sources, affect the time constant so that inde-
pendent sources can be set to zero when deter-
mining the time constant.
•	 The time constant can be determined from 
Thevenin’s resistance seen by C or L, when all inde-
pendent sources are set to zero.
•	 Initial and steady-state, final values of currents 
and voltages are independent of C or L, because 
in the steady state, inductors act as short circuits 
and capacitors as open circuits.
•	 If a first-order circuit contains more than one 
resistor and more than one capacitor or induc-
tor, with or without dependent sources, then the 
circuit should be reducible to a single effective 
resistor and a single effective capacitor or induc-
tor, with or without an independent source.
•	 The transient response in a given circuit 
response provides a smooth transition from the 
initial value of the response to its steady-state, 
final value. This transition from the initial value 
to the final value cannot occur instantaneously 
because energy stored in energy storage ele-
ments cannot be changed instantaneously 
by any physically realizable means. The time 
course of the transient response in a first-order 
circuit is determined by the time constant.

Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	When the exponent t/τ is first formed, t natu-
rally has the same units as τ. If τ is in seconds, 
then t is in seconds, and if τ is in ms, then t is 
in ms. If t is τ is in seconds and is to be expressed 
in ms, while keeping the same value of the expo-
nent, then the new t in ms should be multiplied 
by s/ms or 10−3. Another way of looking at this 
is that t in ms is a larger number than t in s, so t 
in ms in the exponent must be multiplied by 10−3 
to maintain the same value as when t is in s.
	
2.	Never apply initial conditions except to the 
complete solution, and not to the transient 
­solution alone.
	
3.	Always check the correctness of a derived response 
for current or voltage as a function of time by 
determining the values at t = 0 and as t → ∞.
	
4.	Duality can be helpful in checking the correct-
ness of expressions.

Design Problems
P11.51 A 1  μF capacitor in a cardiac defibrillator is charged 
to 2  kV during operation. When the defibrillator is 
switched off, the capacitor should discharge to 20  V 
within 1 s. What should be the effective resistance in 
parallel with the capacitor?
	
Ans. < 217 kΩ.
P11.52 Figure P11.52 illustrates the basic circuit of a timer. 
Timing starts when the switch is closed, with the capac-
itor discharged, and ends when the threshold device D 
is activated by a voltage of 5 V across the capacitor. 
The timing interval is to be varied between 1 and 5 s 
by means of a variable resistor Rv in series with a fixed 
resistor R. Select suitable values of R and Rv .
	
Ans. R = 465 kΩ; Rv = 1.86 MΩ.
P11.53	 It is required to design a neon lamp flasher to flash for 
1 s every 5 s (P11.59). Assume VSRC = 100 V, Vmax = 80 V, 
Vmin = 10 V, and C = 1 μF. Determine R1 and R2. (Hint: 
Determine R′ from Ton by successive approximation 
using a spreadsheet program.)
	
Ans. R1 = 2.659 MΩ; R2 = 261.1 kΩ.
P11.54	 An RC circuit is to be used to integrate a 6  V step 
(Problem P11.60). Determine RC if the error at T = 10 s 
is not to exceed 5% and derive the value of the inte-
grated voltage.
	
Ans. 96.71 s, 0.589 V.
P11.55	 The circuit of P11.61 is to be used to differentiate a 
pulse 100 μs wide. Determine the maximum RC that 
will give at the end of the pulse an output that does not 
exceed 1% of the pulse height.
	
Ans. 21.71 μs.
P11.56	 An electronic voltage measuring instrument has an 
input impedance of 5 MΩ in parallel with 90  pF and 
a maximum input voltage of 100  V (Figure P11.56). 
Specify R and C for an attenuator probe that allows mea-
surement of voltages up to 1000 V without phase shift.
	
Ans. 45 MΩ, 10 pF.

 , and the percent-
age error is this deviation divided by T/τ and multi-
plied by 100. For a given T, the error decreases with 
increasing τ, but for a given VS, the integral vC = VST/τ 
decreases as τ is increased. The magnitude of vC could 
be increased using an operation amplifier (Chapter 13).
P11.61 The switch in Figure P11.61 is closed at t  =  0, with 
the capacitor initially uncharged. For t ≤ 0−, VS  =  0 
and vC = 0, whereas for t ≥ 0+, VS = VSRC. If vR << VS, 
i ≅ CdVS/dt and vR = RCdVS/dt. In other words, the 
voltage across the resistor is proportional to the time 
derivative of the applied voltage step VS so that the cir-
cuit acts as a differentiator at low output voltages. For 
an ideal differentiator, vR = 0 at t = 0+. In the circuit in 
Figure P11.61, vR ≅ 0 at t ≅ 5τ. Hence, to approximate 
a good differentiator, τ should be small, which means 
the output is small.
P11.62 The coil of an electromagnetically operated switch or 
relay is sometimes controlled by an electronic transistor 
switch, as illustrated in Figure P11.62a, where the circuit 
connected to the relay coil is represented by its TEC. (a) 
If the relay coil has an inductance 0.5 H and the tran-
sistor switch interrupts a relay current of 1 A in 1 ms, 
determine the magnitude and polarity of the voltage 
that appears across the relay coil and the transistor as it 
interrupts the current, neglecting the voltage drop in the 
resistances. (b) To protect the transistor from this volt-
age, a diode (Figure P11.62b) is connected across termi-
nals ‘ab’ of the coil. The diode presents an open circuit 
when terminal ‘a’ is positive with respect to terminal ‘b’, 
during normal operation, but when the voltage polarity 
reverses, the diode conducts, virtually short-circuiting 
the coil terminals ‘ab’. The main limitation is a small 
delay in de-energizing the relay. Determine this delay if 
the relay de-energizes when the current drops to 0.2 A, 
assuming a relay coil resistance of 10 Ω.
	
Ans. (a) 500 V across the coil, with terminal ‘b’ positive 
with respect to terminal ‘a’, (500 + VTh) across the tran-
sistor; (b) 80.5 ms.

Objective and Overview
This chapter extends the discussion of Chapter 11 to 
prototypical, second-order circuits consisting of a resis-
tor, capacitor, and inductor, connected in series or in 
parallel. The main objective is to present the three basic 
types of responses that are possible with second-order 
circuits, namely, overdamped, critically damped, and 
underdamped responses, and to explore the main char-
acteristic features of these responses.
The natural responses of the prototypical series 
and parallel circuits are discussed in the first part of 
the chapter. These natural responses are due to ini-
tial energy storage in capacitors or inductors, in the 
absence of any other excitation. The second part of 
the chapter is concerned with the responses of the 
prototypical circuits to applied, steady excitations. 
Appendix 12A outlines the procedure for deriving the 
natural responses of more general second-order cir-
cuits and the responses of these circuits to applied dc 
excitations. Responses of second-order circuits to more 
general forms of excitation are discussed in Part II of 
the book.
12.1  Natural Responses of Series RLC Circuit
A  second-order LTI circuit is so called because its 
responses obey a second-order, linear, ordinary differ-
ential equation with constant coefficients. Second-order 
circuits discussed in this chapter are reducible to a com-
bination of a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor, con-
nected in series or in parallel.
Figure 12.1a illustrates an RLC circuit in which 
the switch is opened at t  =  0. It is assumed that the 
switch has been closed for a sufficiently long time so 
that steady-state conditions prevail before the switch 
is opened. Under these steady-state conditions, the 
inductor acts as a short circuit, so that the source cur-
rent ISRC flows through the inductor and the voltage 
across the capacitor is zero. With the switch open, the 
circuit becomes a series RLC circuit, as in Figure 12.1b. 
The source current is diverted through RD, so that the 
ideal current source is not left open-circuited. It is 
required to determine how the current i in the circuit 
of Figure 12.1b and all the voltages in the circuit vary 
with time for t ≥ 0+.
KCL is automatically satisfied in the series circuit. 
From KVL, vR + vC + vL = 0. Substituting the v–i relations

Note that α and ω0 depend on the circuit parameters 
R, L, and C only. Moreover, since the first term, d2i/dt2, in 
Equation 12.3. has the units of y divided by t2, the other 
two terms must have the same units. This means that α 
and ω0 are in radians/s. For reasons that will become 
clear later, α is referred to as the damping factor and ω0 
as the resonant frequency.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
As mentioned in connection with Equation 11.3, the 
general solution of a homogeneous, linear, ordinary, 
differential equation of any order, but having constant 
coefficients, is the sum of exponentials of the form Aest, 
where s and A are constants for a given circuit and initial 
conditions, and the number of exponential terms in the 
sum is equal to the order of the equation. Substituting in 
Equation 12.3 and collecting terms,

In order to satisfy Equation 12.5 for all t, either A = 0 
or the bracketed terms must sum to zero. If A = 0, all 
the responses in the circuit will be zero. The solution is 
trivial and contradicts the assumption of nonzero initial 
energy storage. Hence,

Equation 12.6 is the characteristic equation of the dif-
ferential Equation 12.3, similar to Equation 11.4, for a 
first-order homogeneous differential equation. It is of 
fundamental importance in the analysis of circuits and 
systems, because it governs the basic natural response 
of the circuit or system. The roots s1 and s2 of Equation 
12.6 are

(12.9)
where A and B are arbitrary constants that depend, 
in general, on the initial conditions as well as s1 
and s2. Note that since Equation 12.3 is second order 
and formally involves two integrations, the general 
solution should have two arbitrary constants, as in 
Equation 12.9. Fundamentally, the initial conditions are 
the values of the energy-related variables at t = 0+, that 
is, inductor current and capacitor voltage, which do not 
change between t = 0− and t = 0+. Mathematically, and 
for convenience, the initial conditions applied are those 
of the variable under consideration and its first deriva-
tive at t = 0+.
It is evident from Equation 12.7 that there are three 
cases to consider, corresponding to α > ω0, α < ω0, and 
α = ω0. These three conditions result in three different 
types of natural responses of second-order circuits, as 
will be discussed in the following subsections. Before 
doing so, however, we will make some generalizations 
based on the discussion in the preceding chapter on 
first-order circuits:
	
1.	As t → ∞, all responses in Figure 12.1 will go to 
zero, because stored energy will eventually be 
dissipated in the resistor, which means that all 
steady-state responses will be zero. The solution 
to Equation 12.3 is therefore a purely transient 
response.
	
2.	The second-order homogeneous differential 
equation is completely specified by α and ω0 and 
hence by the exponents s1 and s2. Linear opera-
tions in LTI circuits do not change the exponents 
s1 and s2. Hence, as discussed in Section 11.5, the 
following concept applies:
Concept: All the circuit variables in a given second-order 
circuit obey the same homogeneous differential equation. The 
same characteristic equation applies to all the circuit variables, 
which means that all these variables have the same s1, s2, α, 
and ω0 and, hence, the same form of the natural response.
It follows that the natural responses in Figure 12.1 
have the general form

(12.12)
where the exponents are the same but the arbitrary 
constants are, in general, different, and s1 ≠ s2. All the 
responses vanish as t → ∞, because s1 and s2 are either 
negative real or have negative real parts (Equation 12.7). 
vR = Ri is directly proportional to i.
Since the same form of the general solution applies to 
all the circuit variables in a given circuit, and in cases 
where the responses to more than one variable are 
required, it will be demonstrated that in a series circuit, 
it is convenient to derive first the general solution for 
vC, the voltage across the capacitor. This has two advan-
tages: (1) the general responses for i, or vR, and vL, are 
obtained by successive differentiation. This is more con-
venient than having to derive some responses through 
integration by parts, as can happen if a variable other 
than vC is considered first. (2) It is easy to verify the volt-
age responses by checking that they satisfy KVL.

Basic Responses of Second-Order Circuits	
333
Exercise 12.1
Verify, by applying the relations between vC and i, 
and between vL and i, in Equation 12.1, that vC and vL 
obey the same homogeneous differential equation in i 
(Equation 12.2).
12.1.1  Overdamped Responses
The natural responses will be illustrated by consider-
ing a numerical example having R = 500 Ω, C = 12.5 μF, 
L = 0.5 H, and I0 = 3 A. Hence, α = R/2L = 500 rad/s

where the subscripts have been dropped from the arbi-
trary constants A and B for convenience. Note that, 
according to Equation 12.13, A and B have the same units 
as vC(t). A and B are determined from the initial condi-
tions. In the circuit of Figure 12.1, the stored energy just 
before the switch is opened at t = 0− is zero in the capaci-
tor and 1 2

It is important to note the following checks on the 
expressions for the responses: (1) vC(0+) = 0, i(0+) = 3 A, 
vR(0+)  =  3  ×  500  =  1500  V, and vL(0+)  =  −1500  V, in 
accordance with KVL at t  =  0+, as illustrated in 
Figure 12.2; (2) as t → ∞, i(∞) = vC(∞) = vL(∞) = 0, since 
all responses become zero when the energy initially 
stored in the ­inductor is dissipated in the resistor; and 
(3) vR + vC + vL = 0 for all t, as required by KVL.
Note that constancy of stored energy in C at the instant 
of switching requires that vC(0+) = 0, but the capacitor 
current can jump instantaneously from zero at  t = 0 − to 
I0 = 3 A at t = 0+ in order to satisfy KCL. Similarly, con-
stancy of stored energy in the inductor at the instant of 
switching requires that the i(0+) = I0, but the inductor 
voltage can jump from 0 to −RI0 in order to satisfy KVL.
Figure 12.3 shows the variation with time, for t ≥ 0+, 
of i, vC, and more conveniently, v

¢ = -
, rather than vL. 
A positive i charges the capacitor, which stores electric 
energy. Both the energy stored in the capacitor and that 
dissipated in the resistor can only come from the energy 
initially stored in the inductor. This means that i must 
decrease with time and eventually go to zero. However, 
the decrease in i is not monotonic, as in a first-order cir-
cuit. The capacitor continues to charge while i is positive 
but decreasing. When i = 0, vC = vL¢, and vC is at a maxi-
mum, since dvC/dt = i/C = 0 at this instant, as indicated 
by the dashed line on the left in Figure 12.3. Beyond this 
time, the capacitor discharges and drives i in the nega-
tive direction. i then reaches a minimum before decaying 
to zero. Note that since vL¢ = −Ldi/dt, then vL¢ > 0 when i 
is decreasing, vL¢ < 0 when i is increasing, and vL¢ = 0

when i is minimum. Eventually, all the energy initially 
stored in the inductor is dissipated in the resistor, and 
all the circuit responses decay to zero. The responses of 
Figure 12.3 are described as overdamped.
What is the effect of increasing R on the overdamped 
response? Suppose that R is increased from 500 to 1500 Ω.

that as R increases, the magnitude of s1 decreases, whereas 
the magnitude of s2 increases, so that es t
1  decreases at a 
slower rate, whereas es t
2  decreases at a faster rate. The 
overall effect can be argued from vL(0+). With I0 = 3 A, 
as before, and R = 1500 Ω, vL(0+) = −4500 V/s instead 
−1500 V/s. But v

. Thus, as R increases, 
vL(0+) becomes more negative, and i decreases at a faster 
rate. This is illustrated in Figure 12.4 for R = 1500 Ω and 
R = 500 Ω. The latter is the same as in Figure 12.3 but on 
an expanded time scale.

The same checks apply as for Equations 12.16 
through 12.19. 
i, vL¢ =  −vL and vC are plotted in Figure 12.5. The 
responses are damped sinusoids, that is, sinusoidal func-
tions whose amplitudes decrement with time because 
of the exponential term e
t
-a  that multiplies the sinu-
soids. That is why α is termed the damping factor. The 
responses of Figure 12.5 are described as underdamped.
When α is large, the amplitudes attenuate rapidly, con-
versely when α is small. This is illustrated in Figure 12.6 
for i and two values of R. i decrements more slowly 
when R = 20 Ω and α = 20 rad/s than when R and α have 
larger values.
Because of the marked oscillations, there is an 
­appreciable alternation of stored energy between the 
inductor and the capacitor. Thus, when i  =  0, energy 
is stored only in the capacitor, but when vC = 0, energy is 
stored only in the inductor.

12.1.3  Critically Damped Responses
The third possibility, when α  =  ω0, makes s1  =  s2  = 
−ω0 = −400 rad/s. The value of R is then R = 2ω0L = 
400 Ω. The responses in this case are described as criti-
cally damped.

seen that the responses are qualitatively similar to the 
overdamped responses of Figure 12.3, although the 
mathematical expressions are of quite different form.
Summary:
	
1.	When R is large enough so that α > ω0, s1 and s2 are neg-
ative real and distinct. The responses are overdamped.
	
2.	When R is such that α = ω0, then s1 = s2 = −ω0. The 
responses are critically damped.
	
3.	When R is small enough so that α < ω0, s1 and s2 are 
complex, the responses are damped sinusoids. The 
responses are underdamped.

and C = 0.4 nF, determine (a) R for critical damping and

What if initial energy was stored in the capacitor 
rather than in the inductor? As emphasized earlier, this 
does not change α and ω0, and hence s1 and s2, because 
these depend only on R, L, and C, and not on the ini-
tial conditions. The type of response, whether over-
damped, underdamped, or critically damped, is the 
same, because the type of response depends only on the 
relative magnitudes of α and ω0. But the arbitrary con-
stants change with the initial conditions, which changes 
the coefficients of the terms in the responses. Example 
12.1 considers the cases of initial energy storage in the 
capacitor alone, and in both the capacitor and inductor. 
The following important concept is illustrated:
Concept: The natural responses due to initial energy storage 
in both the inductor and capacitor can be obtained by super-
position, that is, by adding algebraically the responses due to 
energy storage in the inductor alone and in the capacitor alone.

Example 12.1:  Natural Responses of Series 
RLC Circuit with Initial Energy Storage
Determine i(t), vR(t), vC(t), and vL(t) in the circuit of 
Figure 12.1b if at t = 0, (a) the capacitor has an initial 
voltage V0  =  −1200  V and the inductor has zero ini-
tial current and (b) the capacitor has an initial voltage 
V0 = −1200 V and the inductor has an initial current of 
i(0−) = 3 A.
Solution:
	 (a)	 The circuit is illustrated in Figure 12.8a, where the 
capacitor is charged by the battery to V0 = VSRC and 
is connected via the changeover switch at t = 0 to 
be in series with a resistor R and an uncharged 
inductor L. The circuit becomes as in Figure 12.8b 
for t ≥ 0+. To avoid unnecessary repetition, only the 
case of overdamped responses, with R  =  500 Ω, 
will be considered.
As determined previously for the overdamped 
case, α = 500 rad/s, ω0 = 400 rad/s, s1 = −200 rad/s, 
and s2  =  −800  rad/s. The general solution of 
Equation 12.13 therefore applies, expressed as

t  =  0+, vC¢ = 1200 V, which means that the upper 
plate in Figure  12.8b is positively charged with 
respect to the lower plate. The capacitor begins 
to discharge, driving i in the positive direction, 
so i increases. As i varies with time, it induces a 
voltage vL in the inductor. While i is increasing, 
its increase is opposed by a positive vL. i increases 
at a decreasing rate because of the drop in v'C as 
the capacitor discharges, and because the increase 
in i is opposed by a positive vL, added to the volt-
age drop across the resistor.  vL decreases with the 
decreasing rate of increase of i. i reaches a maxi-
mum, at which time vL = Ldi/dt = 0. i then decreases 
towards zero, resulting in a negative vL that opposes 
the decrease in i. Eventually, all the energy initially 
stored in the capacitor is dissipated in the resistor.

It should be noted that the initial conditions in 
this example have been deliberately chosen so as to 
give B = 0. It can be shown that the condition for 
B = 0 is that I0 = s1CV0, which is satisfied in this case 
(Problem P12.63). This condition is tantamount to 
having the capacitor initially charged to VO and dis-
charging with a time constant 1/s1. vC(t) is then given 
by -
-
V e s t
0
1 . The initial value of the discharge current 
is s1CV0. If this happens to be equal to I0, the initial 
current in the circuit, as is the case in this example, 
then B = 0. This eliminates the term involving the 
exponential in s2, leaving only the term involving 
the exponential in s1. All the responses will have a 
single time constant, as for a first-order circuit.
As a check, (1) vC(0+) = −1200 V, i(0+) = 3 A, vL(0+) = 
−300 V; (2) as t → ∞, vC(∞) = i(∞) = vL(∞) = 0, since 
all responses become zero when the energy ini-
tially stored in the capacitor and in the inductor is 
dissipated in the resistor; and (3) vR + vC + vL = 0 for 
all t, as required by KVL.
The responses are shown in Figure 12.10. Being 
simple exponentials, the tangents to the curves at 
t = 0 intersect the time axis at t = 1/200 s, or 5 ms.
It is important to note that superposition 
applies. Table 12.1 lists the overdamped responses 
due to stored energy in the inductor alone, in the 
capacitor alone, and in both the inductor and 
the  capacitor. Superposition applies, of course, 
to the underdamped and critically damped 
responses as well.

Ans. α = 2 rad/s, wd =

Table 12.2 lists, for reference purposes, the responses 
due to energy storage in each of the capacitor or induc-
tor alone. These responses are derived by following the 
same procedure as in the preceding numerical cases, 
and in Example 12.1, but retaining the general symbols 
(Exercise 12.10).

Derive the general expressions listed in Table 12.2.
Exercise 12.11
Verify that the numerical, overdamped responses i, vR, vL,

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
in Section 12.1.2, this makes α = 0 and ωd = 400 rad/s. 
Equation 12.23 becomes vC(t)  =  Acos400t  +  Bsin400t. 
Having v(0+) = 0 makes A = 0; so that vC(t) = Bsin400t; 
B is determined from the second initial condition that 
i(0+) = C(dvC/dt)0+ = 3 A. This gives 12 5 10

The responses are nondecrementing, sustained oscil-
lations (Figure 12.12b). As to be expected, vL leads i by 
90° and vC lags i by 90°. With R = 0, there is no power dis-
sipation in the circuit. Energy is continually exchanged 
between magnetic energy stored in the inductor and 
electric energy stored in the capacitor. When vC = vL = 0, 
the magnitude of i is maximum, and all the energy 
is stored in the inductor. The energy at this instant is 
(1/2)Li2 = 9/4 = 2.25 J. When i = 0, the magnitude of vC 
is maximum, and all the energy is stored in the capaci-
tor. The energy at this instant is (1/2)Cv2 = (1/2) × 12.5 × 
10−6 × (600)2 = 2.25 J. At intermediate times, energy is 
stored partly in the inductor and partly in the capacitor, 
but the total energy w(t) at any instant is 2.25 J. Thus,

Having R = 0 may seem an ideal case that cannot be 
realized in practice. But active devices, such as tran-
sistors, can be used to introduce a negative resistance 
that effectively reduces R to zero. In other words, the 
active device introduces sufficient energy to compen-
sate for the power dissipated in the circuit, so that 
continuous oscillations are produced. This is the prin-
ciple behind LC oscillators, which are commonly used 
in practice.
Primal Exercise 12.12
If L  =  10  μH, determine C that gives an oscillation 
­frequency of 100 kHz.
Ans. 0.253 μF.
Primal Exercise 12.13
Assume that the circuit of Figure 12.12 started oscillating 
at 1 Mrad/s, with initial energies of 1.5 μJ in the inductor 
and 0.5 μJ in the capacitor. Determine L if the peak volt-
age across the circuit is 2 V.
Ans. 1 μH.
Primal Exercise 12.14
Given that i = sinω0t A in Figure 12.13, determine the 
smallest t > 0 at which the instantaneous energy stored 
in the capacitor (a) is a maximum, and (b) is equal to that 
stored in the inductor.
Ans. (a) 2π = 6.28 s; (b) π/2 = 1.57 s.
12.2  Natural Response of Parallel GCL Circuit
The dual of the series RLC circuit considered in Section 
12.1 is the parallel GCL circuit (Figure 12.14). For t < 0−, 
the capacitor is charged to V0  =  VSRC and the induc-
tor is uncharged (Figure 12.14a). At t = 0+, the switch 
is moved, and the circuit becomes as in Figure 12.14b. 
Table 12.3 lists the dual quantities in both cases.
The initial conditions first considered in Section 12.1 
were i(0+) = 3 A and vC(0+) = 0 V. The corresponding 
initial conditions in the dual GCL circuit are, from 
Table 12.3, v(0+) = 3 V and iL(0+) = 0. We will analyze this 
case for overdamped responses from first principles 
to illustrate that v and the currents in Figure 12.14 are 
the same as those derived from substituting the dual 
quantities of Table 12.3 in the equations for the series

RLC circuit. Just as it is convenient in the case of the 
series RLC circuit to derive the solution for vC first, it 
is convenient in the case of the parallel GCL circuit to 
derive the solution for iL, the dual of vC, first.
From KCL, iG  +  iC  +  iL  =  0. The voltage v across 
the parallel combination is v(t)  =  LpdiL/dt, and 
iG(t)  =  Gpv  =  GpLpdiL/dt; iC(t)  =  Cpdv/dt  =  LpCpd2iL/dt2.

As a check, (1) v(0+) = 3 V, iC(0+) = −1500 A, iG(0+) = 1500 
A, in accordance with KCL; (2) as t → ∞, v(∞) = iL(∞) = 
iC(∞) = 0, since all responses become zero when the 
energy initially stored in the capacitor is dissipated in 
the resistor; and (3) iG + iC + iL = 0 for all t, as required by 
KCL. Equations 12.58 through 12.61 are the dual rela-
tions of Equations 12.16 through 12.19, respectively.
The general expressions for the overdamped, ­critically 
damped, and underdamped natural responses of the 
parallel GCL circuit follow from those of the series RLC 
circuit listed in Table 12.2, but with dual quantities inter-
changed in accordance with Table 12.3.
Exercise 12.15
Derive from duality, using Tables 12.2 and 12.3, the 
responses of the parallel GCL circuit when initial energy 
is stored in the inductor alone.
Primal Exercise 12.16
Both switches in Figure 12.15 are moved at t = 0, the ini-
tial stored energies being 12.5 J in the inductor and 0.5 J 
in the capacitor. Determine iC at t = 0+. Note that this is 
the dual case of Primal Exercise 12.7.
Ans. 8 A.
Primal Exercise 12.17
The switch in Figure 12.16 is closed at t = 0, with an initial 
voltage VC0 = 5 V, and no energy stored in the inductor. 
(a) Determine v(0+), iL(0+), and iC(0+); (b) specify whether 
the response for t ≥ 0+ is overdamped, critically damped, 
or underdamped.
Ans. (a) v(0+) 5  V, iL(0+)  =  0, iC(0+)  =  −2.5  A; (b) 
underdamped.
12.3  Charging of Series RLC Circuit
In Figure 12.17, a battery of voltage VSRC is applied at 
t = 0 to a series RLC circuit with no initial energy stor-
age. It is required to determine the circuit responses 
for t ≥ 0+.
From KVL after the switch is closed, vR + vL + vC = VSRC. 
As explained earlier, it is convenient in a series circuit to 
derive vC first. We note that vR = Ri = RCdvC/dt and that 
vL  =  Ldi/dt  =  LCd2vC/dt2. Substituting these relations

that the transient component is given by Equation 12.11.

where s1 and s2 are given by Equation 12.7. Note that s1 
and s2 either are negative real or have a negative real 
part, so that vC → VSRC as t → ∞. It is clear from the circuit 
of Figure 12.17 that in the steady state after the switch is 
closed, the inductor acts as a short circuit and the capaci-
tor as an open circuit, so that i(∞) = 0 and vC(∞) = VSRC.
The arbitrary constants A and B are determined by 
applying the initial conditions to the complete solution. The 
stored energy is zero at t = 0−, so it remains zero at t = 0+. 
This means that i(0+) = 0, vC(0+) = 0, and vL(0+) = VSRC in 
order to satisfy KVL at this instant (Figure 12.18). Since, 
vC(0+) = 0, Equation 12.65 gives

Equations 12.69 through 12.72 apply to overdamped 
and underdamped responses. They do not apply to the 
critically damped case, because s1 = s2 gives 0/0 in the 
responses, which is indeterminate.

12.3.2  Critically Damped Response
In a critically damped circuit, α = ω0, so that s1 = s2 = −ω0. 
The transient response is given by Equation 12.30. In 
the final steady state, the inductor acts as a short circuit 
and the capacitor as an open circuit, so that i (∞) = 0, 
vL(∞) = 0, and vC(∞) = VSRC. The complete solution for 
vC is

with A  =  −VSRC, and setting t  =  0, gives B  =  −ω0VSRC.

underdamped response, and Equations 12.80 through 12.83 
for the critically damped response all satisfy initial condi-
tions, final steady-state conditions, and KVL: (1) vC(0+) = 0, 
i(0+) = 0, vL(0+) = VSRC; (2) i(∞) = 0,  vL(∞) = 0, vC(∞) = VSRC; 
and (3) vR + vL + vC = VSRC, all in accordance with KVL.
The responses of the series RLC circuit during charg-
ing, with zero initial conditions, are summarized in the 
first column of Table 12.4.
12.3.3  Comparison of Responses
It is important to appreciate the differences in the 
step responses of the overdamped, critically damped, 
and underdamped circuits. In Figure 12.19, a voltage 
of 10 V is applied at t = 0 to a series RLC circuit hav-
ing L = 0.5 H and C = 12.5 μF, as used in Section 12.1. 
Figures 12.20 and 12.21 show the variation of i and vC 
for t  ≥  0+ and for R  =  100, 200, 400, and 700 Ω. The 
responses are overdamped for R  =  700 Ω, are criti-
cally damped for R  =  400  Ω, and are underdamped 
for R  =  100 and 200  Ω. The simulation procedure is 
described in Example 12.2.
All the current plots in Figure 12.20 have the same 
slope of (40 mA)/(2 ms) = 20 A/s at t = 0. This is because 
di dt
/
(
) +
0 = vL(0+)/L = VSRC/L = 20 A/s, irrespective of R. 
As to be expected, the overdamped response has the 
smallest peak current value, because of the largest resis-
tance. This peak value increases for smaller values of 
resistance. The two underdamped responses are oscil-
latory, the oscillations becoming more marked as the 
resistance decreases.
The following characteristics of the responses of vC 
shown in Figure 12.21 should be noted:
	
1.	The overdamped response is the slowest of the 
responses to approach the steady-state value. This 
is to be expected, since vC is proportional to the 
integral of the current, and the amplitude of the 
current decreases with increasing R (Figure 12.20). 
This means that the larger R, the smaller the area 
under the current curve is, at least up to t between 
7 and 8 ms in Figure 12.20. The area under the i vs. 
t  curve is the same for all R as t → ∞, because the 
final value of vC is the same

Basic Responses of Second-Order Circuits	
345
	
2.	The critically damped response is the fastest 
of the responses to approach the steady-state 
value without overshoot.
	
3.	The underdamped response is the fastest to 
reach the steady-state value, but overshoots this 
value and oscillates about it at a frequency ωd 
before settling to the final value. As the resis-
tance decreases, the overshoot increases, and 
the oscillations become more pronounced. In 
the limit, as R → 0, ωd → ω0.
If we consider the 9 V level in Figure 12.21, for exam-
ple, the overdamped response (700 Ω) reaches this level 
at 19.2 ms, the critically damped response at 9.72 ms, 
the underdamped response having R = 200 Ω at 5.31 ms, 
and the underdamped response having R  =  100  Ω at 
4.32 ms. However, the underdamped response can have 
unacceptable overshoot and undershoot.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Example 12.2:  Simulation of Step Responses 
of Series RLC Circuit
It is required to simulate the circuit in Figure 12.17 to 
obtain the variation of i and vc for t ≥ 0+ and for R = 100, 
200, 400, and 700 Ω.
Simulation: The schematic is entered as in Figure 12.22, 
with zero initial conditions (IC = 0) in the inductor and 
capacitor. PSpice automatically applies the 10  V VDC 
source at the start of the simulation (t = 0) without the 
need to connect a switch that closes at t = 0. In order to 
display a family of curves for various values of R, R is 
first declared as a global parameter, as follows: double-
click on the default resistance value displayed, which 
invokes the ‘Display Properties’ window. In the ‘Value’ 
field, enter a chosen designation enclosed in curly brack-
ets, which tells PSpice that this is a parameter and not a 
fixed value. In the present example, {R_val} is entered. 
The next step is to declare {R_val} a global parameter. 
Place the part ‘PARAM’ from the ‘SPECIAL’ library; this 
shows on the schematic as ‘PARAMETERS:.’ When this 
word is double-clicked, the Property Editor spreadsheet 
is displayed. Click on the ‘New Column’ button to display 
the ‘Add New Column’ dialog box. Enter R_val in the 
‘Name’ field and any value, say, 100, in the ‘Value’ field. 
A new column R_val is added to the spreadsheet with the 
entry 100. To have this displayed on the schematic, click 
on the ‘Display’ button and choose ‘Name’ and ‘Value’ in 
the ‘Display Properties’ dialog box. R_val = 100 appears 
under ‘PARAMETERS:,’ as shown in Figure 12.22.
To run the simulation, select ‘Time Domain 
(Transient)’ in the Simulation. Select ‘General Settings’ 
under ‘Options’ and enter 25m for ‘Run to time’, 0 for 
‘Start saving data after’, and 5u for ‘Maximum step size.’ 
Then select ‘Parametric Sweep’ under ‘Options’, choose 
‘Global parameter’ under ‘Sweep variable’, and enter 
R_val for ‘Parameter name’. In the ‘Value list’ under 
‘Sweep type’, enter: 100,200,400,700. Apply a current 
marker to the marked terminal of the inductor, without 
the voltage marker at the capacitor terminal, and run the 
simulation. An available sections window is displayed 
that allows you to select plots for one or more values 
of R. This is useful for identifying which trace belongs to 
which value of R. When all traces are selected, the current 
plots of Figure 12.20 are displayed. When the simulation 
is run with the voltage marker applied at the capacitor 
terminal, without the current marker at the inductor ter-
minal, the plots of Figure 12.21 are displayed.

12.3.4  Charging of Parallel GCL Circuit
The dual of the series RLC circuit charged by a dc volt-
age VSRC is the parallel GCL circuit charged by a dc 
current ISRC (Figure 12.25), where the dual quantities 
are those listed in Table 12.3 and with the value of ISRC 
numerically equal to that of VSRC. The responses are 
derived in a manner exactly analogous to that of the 
series RLC circuit for the three cases of overdamping, 
critical damping, and underdamping. These responses 
are summarized in the second column of Table 12.4, for 
zero initial conditions. The dual of the response i of the 
series RLC circuit in Figure 12.17 is v of the parallel GCL 
parallel circuit, whereas the dual response of vC of the 
series RLC circuit in Figure 12.17 is iL of the parallel GCL 
parallel circuit.
12.4  Procedure for Analyzing Prototypical 
Second-Order Circuits
All second-order circuits containing both inductors and 
capacitors that are considered in this chapter are reduc-
ible to the prototypical series RLC or parallel GCL cir-
cuits discussed in the preceding sections. An essential 
difference between the series and parallel configurations 
when deriving the circuit responses is the ­expression 
for α. The expression for ω0 is 1/ LC in both cases. 
But α = R/2L in the case of the series circuit, whereas in 
the case of the parallel circuit,

(12.84)
where Rp = 1/Gp. Only when the series and parallel cir-
cuits are duals are the numerical values of α and αp equal 
to one another. It is seen that, for given L and C, increas-
ing the resistance R in the series circuit increases α and the 
damping, whereas increasing the resistance Rp in the parallel 
circuit decreases αp and the damping.
In the absence of independent sources, differential 
equations governing circuit responses are homoge-
neous, which means that the responses are purely tran-
sient in nature, with zero responses in the final steady 
state. In the presence of independent sources:
Complete response = transient response + final, 
steady-state response
The transient response is the solution of the homoge-
neous differential equation, and the final, steady-state 
response is the solution of the nonhomogeneous differ-
ential equation, for t ≥ 0+, with all time derivatives set 
to zero.
It is important to bear in mind the following:
	
1.	When determining the transient response, indepen-
dent sources are set to zero. The argument is analo-
gous to that made in Section 11.5, to justify that 
the time constant is not affected by indepen-
dent sources. First, independent sources do not 
appear in the homogeneous differential equa-
tion; second, as voltages and currents change 
in the course of the transient responses, ideal 
voltage sources act as short circuits, and ideal 
current sources act as open circuits, as far as the 
changes are concerned.
	
2.	Setting independent sources to zero also ascer-
tains, in case of uncertainty, whether the circuit 
configuration is series or parallel and hence 
whether to use the expression for α or αp.
	
3.	The arbitrary constants are part of the tran-
sient response. However, they should be deter-
mined by applying initial conditions to the complete 
response.
	
4.	Since all voltages and currents in a given circuit 
are governed by the same homogeneous differ-
ential equation, all the responses have the same 
ω0, α, or αp.
The preferred procedure for analyzing a prototypi-
cal, second-order RLC circuit is not based on deriving 
the differential equation for a particular circuit variable,

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
as this complicates the analysis unnecessarily. The gen-
eral procedure is as follows:
	
1.	Determine the initial values of the circuit variables 
of interest at t = 0− and t = 0+ as well as their final, 
steady-state values.
	
2.	Set independent source to zero in the circuit for 
t ≥ 0+ in order to ascertain whether the configura-
tion is series or parallel and to derive the transient 
response.
	
3.	Reduce the circuit to a prototypical series RLC or 
parallel GCL circuit, as appropriate. Effective values 
of circuit parameters may have to be derived, includ-
ing the effects of any dependent sources.
	
4.	Determine ω0, α, or αp, to ascertain the type of circuit 
damping, that is, whether the circuit is overdamped, 
underdamped, or critically damped.
	
5.	Decide on the circuit variable whose response is to 
be derived first. It is generally more convenient 
to derive vC first in a series circuit and iL first in a 
parallel circuit.

ples and by problems at the end of the chapter.
Primal Exercise 12.22
The switch in Figure 12.26 is closed at t = 0 after being 
open for a long time. Determine whether the circuit 
responses are overdamped, underdamped, or criti-
cally damped, assuming that C is (a) 25 mF, (b) 4 mF, or 
(c) 1 mF.
Ans. (a) overdamped; (b) critically damped; (c) 
underdamped.
Example 12.3:  Responses of Series RLC Circuit 
with Initial Energy Storage
The switch in Figure 12.27 is moved at t = 0 from posi-
tion ‘a’ to position ‘b’ after being in position ‘a’ for a 
long time. The switch shown is a make-before-break 
type of switch, which makes contact with terminal ‘b’ 
before breaking with terminal ‘a’. This ensures that the 
ideal current source is not open-circuited as the current 
is diverted from the RLC circuit to RD. It is required to 
determine (a) R for critical damping and (b) the circuit 
responses for t ≥ 0+.
Solution: 
At t = 0−, after the switch has been in position ‘a’ for 
a long time, the inductor acts as a short ­circuit under 
steady conditions and the capacitor as an open cir-
cuit (Figure  12.28a). It follows that IL0  =  0.05  A and 
VC0 = 0.05R V. For t ≥ 0+, the current source is diverted

α = R/2L = ω0 = 103 rad/s. Hence, R  =  2  × 
0.5 × 103 = 1000 Ω.
	 (b)	 Since the circuit is critically damped, all the circuit 
responses are of the form of Equation 12.86, with 
final, steady-state values equal to zero, because all 
initially stored energy is eventually dissipated in the 
resistor. Since all circuit responses are required, it is 
convenient to derive the response for vC first. Hence,

ferentiated, the right-hand side multiplied by C and 
set equal to −0.05 at t = 0+; the minus sign is used 
because iL is in a direction of a voltage rise across C. 
The resulting equation is 2 × 10−6(−50 × 103 + B) = 
−0.04, which gives B = 25 × 103 V/s. Hence,

It can be readily verified that the expressions 
for the responses are the sum of the corresponding 
expressions in the two columns for critical damp-
ing in Table 12.2, bearing in mind that the relative 
positive polarity of vC is opposite that assumed in 
the table. The responses satisfy the initial condi-
tions, the final steady-state conditions, and KVL. 
Note that if t is in ms instead of s, the responses 
assume simpler forms.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 12.29 with 
initial values as indicated, taking into account the polar-
ity markings on L and C to correspond to the assigned 
positive directions in Figure 12.28b. In the Simulation 
Settings, ‘Analysis type’ is ‘Time Domain (Transient),’ 
‘Run to time’ is 5m, ‘start saving data after’ is 0, and 
‘Maximum step size’ is 1u. After the simulation is run, 
the plots of Figure  12.30 are displayed. vC decreases 
monotonically as C discharges. iL also decreases mono-
tonically, but diL/dt = 0 at t = 0 because vL = 0 at t = 0. 
Since iL is decreasing, vL is always negative (−vL > 0). vL is 
bound to have a minimum (or −vL a maximum) because 
it starts at zero at t = 0 and ends at zero as t → ∞, but is 
not zero in between. The minimum of vL occurs at the 
point of inflection of iL.
Problem-Solving Tips
•	 It is safer to analyze second-order circuits using 
the standard units of amperes, volts, and seconds. 
Conversion to more convenient units can be left to 
the end.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
•	 It is often convenient and helpful to keep α, αp, ω0, 
ωd, s1, and s2 as symbols and to substitute numerical 
values at the end of the analysis or wherever neces-
sary in the course of the analysis. The same is some-
times true of the circuit parameters R, L, and C.
•	 When differentiating expressions containing arbi-
trary constants in order to apply initial conditions, 
ignore terms in t or sinω0t that are zero at t = 0.
Exercise 12.23
Verify that the responses of Example 12.3 satisfy the 
­corresponding entries in Table 12.2.
Exercise 12.24
Verify that the minimum of vL and the point of inflec-
tion of iL in Example 12.3 both occur at t = 1 ms. Use 
the expressions with t in ms and ignore the multiplying 
coefficients.
Example 12.4:  Forced Responses of Parallel 
GCL Circuit with Initial Energy Storage
The switch in Figure 12.31 is closed at t = 0 after being 
open for a long time. It is required to determine iL(t) and 
vL(t) for t ≥ 0+.
Solution:
In the steady state at t = 0−, the inductor acts as a short 
circuit and the capacitor as an open circuit, as shown in 
Figure 12.32a. Taking the lower node as reference, the 
voltage of the upper node ‘a’ is 30 V. The current flow-
ing downward in the 30 Ω resistor is therefore 1 A. From 
KCL, IL0 = 0.5 A, and VL0 = 0.
In the final steady state, as t → ∞, the inductor again 
acts as a short circuit and the capacitor as an open circuit, 
but with the 120 V source and the 60 Ω resistor added 
to the circuit, as in Figure 12.32b. Va is 30 V, so that the 
current through the 60 Ω resistor is (120–30)/60 = 1.5 A; 
iL(∞) = ILF = 2 A, and vL(∞) = VLF = 0.
When the independent sources are set to zero in 
the circuit for t ≥ 0+ and the 60 and 30 Ω resistors are 
combined in parallel into a 20  Ω resistor, the cir-
cuit reduces to the parallel circuit of Figure 12.32c.

is 50m, ‘Start saving data after’ is 0, and ‘Maximum

from its initial value of 0.5 A to its final value of 2 A, with 
diL/dt = 0 at t = 0 because VL0 = 0 at t = 0. Since iL is increas-
ing, v is always positive. v is bound to have a maximum 
because it starts at zero at t = 0 and ends at zero as t → ∞, 
but is not zero in between. The maximum of vL occurs at

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Solution:
For t ≥ 0+, the circuit is a series RLC circuit but with an 
effective resistance because of the resistive circuit that 
includes a dependent source. The initial values at t = 0− 
are i(0−) = 0, vL(0−) = 0, vC(0−) = 5 V, and vX(0−) = 0. At 
t = 0+, i and vC do not change, because the stored energy 
does not change at the instant of switching, so that 
i(0+) = 0, vC(0+) = 5 V, vX(0+) = 0, the dependent current 
source is zero, and the voltage drop across the two resis-
tors is zero. It follows that vL(0+) = 5 V in order to satisfy 
KVL. As t → ∞, i(∞) → 0, since the capacitor acts as an 
open circuit, vL(∞) → 0, since the inductor acts as a short 
circuit. vX(∞) = 0, the dependent current source is zero, 
and the voltage drop across the two resistors is zero. It 
follows that vC(∞) = 10 V to satisfy KVL.
The next step is to determine the effective series resis-
tance. The general procedure is to apply KVL, KCL, and 
Ohm’s law, as illustrated in Figure 12.37. The depen-
dent source current is 0.005vX = 0.005 × 100i = 0.5i. The 
current in the 40  Ω resistor is therefore 0.5i. Hence, 
vR = 100i + 40 × 0.5i = 120i, so that the effective series 
resistance is vR/i = 120 Ω.
Alternatively, the source absorption theorem can be 
applied in this case. The voltage across the 40 Ω resistor 
is 40(i − 0.005vx) = 40(0.01vx − 0.005vx) = 40 × 0.005vx. The 
dependent source is therefore equivalent to a resistance 
40 × 0.005vx/0.005vx = 40 Ω. The effective resistance is 
100  Ω in series with two 40  Ω resistances in parallel, 
which gives 120 Ω.

Since the circuit is a series circuit and all responses are

A = −5 V. To obtain B, Equation 12.98 is differentiated

Basic Responses of Second-Order Circuits	
353
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 12.38 with 
initial values as indicated, taking into account the polar-
ity marking on C to correspond to the assigned positive 
direction of i in Figure 12.36. In the Simulation Settings, 
‘Analysis type’ is ‘Time Domain (Transient),’ ‘Run to 
time’ is 1m, ‘Start saving data after’ is 0, and ‘Maximum 
step size’ is 0.1u. After the simulation is run, the plots of 
Figure 12.39 are displayed. It is seen that the responses 
are only weakly oscillatory because the circuit is not 
heavily underdamped. i increases when the switch 
is closed, which increases the charge on the capacitor. 
As the capacitor voltage increases, the rate of increase of 
i decreases. Eventually, vC reaches a maximum, and i = 0 
at this instant. The capacitor then discharges slightly, 
and i goes negative. vL is positive for increasing i, is neg-
ative for decreasing i, and is zero when i has a maximum 
or a minimum.
Exercise 12.25
Verify that (a) vC in Example 12.5 is the same as that 
obtained from the v–i relation of the capacitor, (b) i is 
maximum when vL = 0 and at the point of inflection of 
the vC curve, and (c) the responses in Example 12.5 can 
be derived by superposition of the responses due to VSRC 
acting alone, and Vc0 acting alone.

•	 All the circuit variables in a given circuit obey 
the same homogeneous differential equation. 
The same characteristic equation applies to all 
the circuit variables, which means that all these 
variables have the same s1, s2, α, and ω0 and, 
hence, the same form of the natural response.

eral, different, and s1 ≠ s2.
•	 For given L and C, the nature of the roots s1 
and s2 depends on R:
	
1.	 When R is large enough so that α  >  ω0, s1 
and s2 are negative real and distinct. The 
responses are said to be overdamped.
	
2.	 When R is such that α = ω0, then s1 = s2 = −ω0. 
The responses are said to be critically damped.
	
3.	 When R is small enough so that α  <  ω0, 
s1 and s2 are complex, the responses are 
damped sinusoids. The responses are said 
to be underdamped.
•	 The natural responses due to initial energy 
storage in both the inductor and capacitor can 
be obtained by superposition, that is, by add-
ing algebraically the responses due to energy 
storage in the inductor acting alone and in the 
capacitor acting alone.
•	 The responses of series RLC circuits and par-
allel GCL circuits are related by duality con-
siderations. The expression w0

equal to one another. It is seen that, for given 
L and C, increasing the resistance R in the 
series ­circuit increases α and the damping, 
whereas increasing the resistance Rp in the 
parallel circuit decreases αp and the damping.
•	 In the charging of a series RLC circuit or a paral-
lel GCL circuit:
	
1.	 The overdamped response is the slowest of 
the responses to approach the steady-state 
value.
	
2.	 The critically damped response is the fastest 
of the responses to approach the steady-state 
value without overshoot.
	
3.	 The underdamped response is the fastest to 
reach the steady-state value, but overshoots 
this value and oscillates about it at a fre-
quency ωd before settling to the final value.
•	 In a second-order circuit, the transient response 
and circuit configuration, that is, whether series 
or parallel, can be determined after setting all 
independent sources to zero. This is because the 
transient response is determined by the homo-
geneous differential equation, which does not 
involve independent sources.
•	 The responses of a second-order LC circuit can 
be determined without having to derive the 
differential equation of the circuit by following 
a systematic procedure of general applicability:
	
1.	 After ascertaining whether the configuration 
is series or parallel, the values of ω0, α, or αp, 
are derived to determine whether the circuit 
is overdamped, underdamped, or critically 
damped.
	
2.	 If the responses of more than one circuit 
variable are required, it is convenient to 
derive vC first in a series circuit and iL first 
in a parallel circuit, since all other responses 
follow from the v–i relations of the circuit 
elements through successive differentiation.
	
3.	 The general expressions for the response of 
any variable can be expressed in one of the 
following forms, for t ≥ 0+:

Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	It is safer to analyze second-order circuits using 
the standard units of amperes, volts, and sec-
onds. Conversion to more convenient units can 
be left to the end.
	
2.	It is often convenient and helpful to keep α, αp, 
ω0, ωd, s1, and s2 as symbols and to substitute 
numerical values at the end of the analysis or 
wherever appropriate in the course of the anal-
ysis. The same is sometimes true of the circuit 
parameters R, L, and C.
	
3.	When differentiating expressions containing 
arbitrary constants in order to apply initial con-
ditions, ignore terms in t or sinω0t that are zero 
at t = 0.
	
4.	In a series RLC circuit, it is generally conve-
nient to derive the response vC first and to use 
i = CdvC/dt to find the second arbitrary constant.
	
5.	In a parallel GCL circuit, it is generally conve-
nient to derive the response iL first and to use 
v = LdiL/dt to find the second arbitrary constant.
	
6.	It is important to always check that all responses 
satisfy initial conditions, final, steady-state con-
ditions, and KCL or KVL, as may be appropriate.
Appendix 12A: More General 
Second-Order Circuits
The procedure described in Section 12.4 can be readily 
generalized to derive the natural and step responses of 
second-order circuits that are not reducible to the proto-
typical series RLC or parallel GCL. The procedure will be 
illustrated with reference to the circuit of Figure 12.40. 
It is assumed in this circuit that the switch is closed at 
t = 0, after being open for a long time, which means that 
no initial energy is stored in the circuit at t = 0−.

Basic Responses of Second-Order Circuits

The general procedure is to set independent sources 
to zero and derive the homogeneous differential equa-
tion for a selected variable, for t ≥ 0+. The general solu-
tion of this equation is formulated, having two arbitrary 
constants and taking into account the final steady-state 
value of the selected variable. The values of these con-
stants are obtained from the values of this variable and 
its first derivative at t = 0+.
Suppose iL is the required variable. In order to derive 
the homogeneous differential equation satisfied by iL 
for t  ≥  0+, the independent source is set to zero, with 
the switch closed. The circuit becomes as shown in 
Figure 12.41. KCL at the upper node gives

With zero initial energy storage, iL(0+) = iL(0−) = 0 and 
vC(0+) = vC(0−) = 0. To determine (diL/dt)0+, we note that 
with iL(0+) and vC(0+) both zero, the voltage across the 
inductor is zero, so that (diL/dt)0+  =  0. VSRC appears 
across R1 at t = 0+ and the current VSRC/R1 flows through 
C. The two initial conditions are used in Equation 12.111, 
12.112, or 12.113 appropriately to determine A and B. ILF 
is VSRC/(R1 + R2).

Objective and Overview
An operational amplifier, or op amp in short, is an elec-
tronic device that was commonly used in analog comput-
ers in the 1950s, before the advent of digital computers. 
Operational amplifiers are so called because they were 
at the heart of various building blocks that performed 
mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, 
differentiation, and integration. These building blocks 
were used to solve differential equations on analog com-
puters. Nowadays, op amps of high performance and 
low cost are widely available in integrated-circuit (IC) 
form, which makes them an important building block in 
a variety of signal-processing applications. In electric cir-
cuits, op amps are used in active filters. They are there-
fore introduced in this chapter before passive filters are 
discussed in Chapter 14 and active filters in Chapter 15.
This chapter begins with some basic considerations on 
op amps, including the definition and properties of ideal 
and almost-ideal op amps. The very important concept 
of feedback is then introduced as a prelude to discuss-
ing the two basic op amp configurations: inverting and 
noninverting. These configurations are then considered 
in detail, including some of their variants, such as the 
unity-gain follower, adder, ideal integrator, and differen-
tiator. The chapter ends with the analysis of the differ-
ence amplifier.
13.1  Basic Properties
Definition: An op amp is a three-terminal, voltage-operated 
device whose output voltage is directly proportional to the dif-
ference between the voltages applied to its two input terminals.
Figure 13.1 illustrates the symbol of an operational 
amplifier. One of the inputs is designated as a nonin-
verting input, denoted by the (+) sign, whereas the other 
input is designated as an inverting input, denoted by 
the (−) sign. According to the preceding definition, the 
output voltage vO is related as follows to the voltages vP 
and vN applied to the noninverting and inverting termi-
nals, respectively:
	
v
A
v

O
v
P
N

(13.1)
Av is the voltage gain of the amplifier. The voltages 
vO, vP, and vN are referenced with respect to a common 
ground. The effective input to the op amp is the volt-
age difference (vP – vN), denoted by ε and referred to as 
the differential input to the amplifier. Because of the 
dependence of the output on the differential input, the 
op amp is an example of a differential amplifier.
It is seen from Equation 13.1 that the sign of vO is the 
same as that vP but is opposite that of vN, hence the des-
ignation of vP as a noninverting, or positive (P) input 
and vN as an inverting, or negative input (N).

2.	Like an ideal voltage source, the amplifier has zero 
output resistance and can deliver any output voltage 
or current at any frequency.
	
3.	Both inputs behave as open circuits.
	
4.	The op amp is free from all imperfections, such as 
nonlinearities or any form of distortion of the output 
with respect to the input.
Just as in the case of ideal circuit elements, the ideal 
op amp is a very useful abstraction that can be used in 
initial designs and which is commonly invoked to illus-
trate some important circuit concepts. Many practical 
op amps approach the ideal in several respects, so the 
concept is not as farfetched as it may seem.
13.1.1  Almost-Ideal Op Amp
In order to gain some insight into the basic properties of 
op amps, consider, to begin with, an op amp that is ideal

except for a finite Av. An input vI is applied to the nonin-
verting input, with the inverting input grounded and a 
load resistance RL connected to the output, as illustrated 
in Figure 13.2a. According to Equation 13.1, with vN = 0

(13.3)
With vO finite, a current iO = vO/RL flows through RL 
in accordance with Ohm’s law. According to the defini-
tion of an ideal op amp, the op amp inputs behave as 
open circuits, which means that the input current is zero 
(Figure 13.2a). If the op amp is enclosed by a surface S, 
then the current entering this surface is zero, whereas 
the current leaving it is iO ≠ 0, in apparent violation of 
KCL. Moreover, the power input to the op amp is zero, 
but the instantaneous power output is vOiO ≠ 0, in appar-
ent violation of conservation of power. Clearly, this can-
not be the case, so what is missing?
Fundamentally, the characterizing attribute of any 
amplifying device, including an op amp, is its ability to 
amplify power; that is, at any instant of time, the power out-
put of the device, due to a source applied to the input of the 
device, is larger than the power delivered by this source 
to the device. For this to happen, at least one external dc 
supply, referred to as a bias supply, must be connected to 
the device. When the current through this supply and the 
power delivered by it are taken into account, both KCL 
and conservation of energy are satisfied.
Op amps usually have two dc bias supplies, one that 
applies a positive voltage VCC
+  to the op amp, and the 
other applies a negative voltage VCC
- , as illustrated in 
Figure 13.2b. The magnitudes of these voltages are usu-
ally equal, but they need not be. The bias supplies are 
connected between specially provided pins of the IC op 
amp and ground. When these bias supplies are taken 
into account, then KCL gives at every instant

(13.5)
If, for example, the input of the op amp is connected 
to a microphone and the output to a loudspeaker, then 
the audio-signal power delivered to the loudspeaker is 
derived from the bias supplies.
The next step is to consider the input–output charac-
teristic of an op amp, that is, the vO-ε relation, taking into 
account a finite Av and the presence of bias supplies. It 
follows from Equation 13.3 that this relation is a straight 
line passing through the origin and having a slope Av, 
assuming Av is constant. This is illustrated in Figure 
13.3a, from which it is seen that the line extends on both 
sides of the origin; that is, a positive input gives a positive 
output, whereas a negative input gives a negative output. 
If Av → ∞, the straight-line characteristic coincides with 
the vertical axis, since the ratio of vO to ε goes to infin-
ity. Theoretically, the straight-line characteristic having a 
finite Av extends to infinity in both directions. In practice, 
the output cannot become more positive than VCC
+ , or more 
negative than VCC

lines in Figure 13.3a. The horizontal region where vO is 
ideally equal to VCC
+  is the region of positive saturation, since 
vO is clamped at VCC
+  in this region. The region of positive 
saturation extends from point ‘Q’, having e =
+
V
A
CC
v
/
, to 
more positive values of ε. Similarly, the horizontal region, 
where vO is ideally equal to VCC
- , is the region of negative 
saturation. It extends from point P having e = -
-
V
A
CC
v
/
, to 
more negative values of ε. The part of the characteristic 
between ‘P’ and ‘Q’ is the region of linear operation of the 
op amp, where vO is directly proportional to ε. Note that 
the vO-ε characteristic relates vO to ε under static condi-
tions, that is, a point on the plot is obtained by applying a 
dc differential input and observing the corresponding dc 
output under steady conditions.
In analyzing ideal op amp circuits, it is often con-
venient and instructive to assume a finite Av to begin 
with, and then let Av → ∞. It is also required sometimes 
to assume finite values of VCC
+  and VCC
- , rather than the 
infinite values assumed for an ideal op amp. To avoid 
confusion over terminology, we will adopt the following 
definition of an almost-ideal op amp:
Definition: In an almost-ideal op amp, either Av is a 
finite constant or the bias supplies, VCC
+  and VCC
- , have 
finite ­values, or both. In all other respects, the almost-ideal 
op amp is ideal.
The OPAMP part in PSpice is an almost-ideal op 
amp having default values of Av = 106, VCC
+ = 15 V, and 
VCC
- = -15 V. However, these default values can be 
changed, if desired, in the Property Editor spreadsheet 
of the OPAMP part.
The symbol used in this book for an almost-ideal op 
amp is illustrated in Figure 13.3b, in which finite values 
of Av, VCC
+  and VCC
- , are indicated. In contrast, these sym-
bols are omitted from the symbol for an ideal op amp 
(Figure 13.3c). In both cases, the inputs are shown open 
circuited inside the symbol for emphasis.
It should be noted that in an almost-ideal op amp, and 
in accordance with Equation 13.1, vO depends only on 
the differential input ε = vP – vN, independently of the 
absolute values of vP and vN; that is, adding any positive 
or negative voltage to both vP or vN does not affect vO, as 
long as vP – vN remains the same.
13.1.2  Equivalent Circuit
Over the linear operating region, corresponding to region 
PQ of the input–output characteristic in Figure  13.3a, 
the almost-ideal op amp can be represented on the out-
put side by a VCVS of source voltage Avε, where ε is the 
differential input between the noninverting and invert-
ing inputs, as illustrated in Figure 13.4.
As explained in the preceding subsection, an ampli-
fying device, such as an op amp, delivers power in 
a circuit. It is therefore an active circuit element that is 
represented by an ideal source (Section 1.8). The source 
is a dependent source, since energy is derived from an 
electric source of energy, the dc bias supplies, rather 
than converted from a nonelectric source of energy, as is 
the case with independent sources (Section 2.6).
VCC
+  and VCC
-  do not appear in the linear equivalent 
circuit. The extent of the linear range does depend on 
VCC
+  and VCC
- , but within the linear operating range, over 
which the equivalent circuit is valid, vO depends only 
on Av and ε, and not on VCC
+  and VCC
- . In the saturation 
regions, the op amp output is represented by a battery 
of voltage VCC
+  in the positive saturation region and a bat-
tery of voltage VCC
-  in the negative saturation region.
The equivalent circuit can be useful in analyzing cir-
cuits involving almost-ideal op amps of finite Av. But 
when Av → ∞ and ε → 0, in an ideal op amp, the equiva-
lent circuit is no longer useful. Circuits involving ideal op 
amps are therefore analyzed using a different approach, 
as illustrated in the rest of the chapter.

Characteristic of the Op Amp in PSpice
It is required to simulate the input–output characteristic 
of the op amp in PSpice.

as in Figure 13.6. It is seen that positive saturation is at 
+15 V, starting at an input voltage of 15 V/106 = 15 μV 
and extending in the positive direction. The nega-
tive saturation starts at −15V starting at an input volt-
age of −15 V/106 = −15 μV and extends in the negative 
direction.

tion and of negative saturation and (b) the differential

13.2  Feedback
Feedback, as the word implies, refers to feeding part or 
all of the output of a device or system back to its input, 
as illustrated in Figure 13.7. The connection from the 
output back to the input is the feedback path, whereas 
the connection from input to output through the system 
is the forward path. The two paths together form the 
feedback loop. Feedback plays a critical role in modify-
ing the behavior of a circuit or system and is extensively 
employed in many types of systems, particularly elec-
tronic circuits and control systems.
Feedback is almost invariably present in op amp cir-
cuits. But since an op amp has two inputs, noninverting 
and inverting, feedback in op amp circuits could be to 
either of these inputs, exclusively or predominantly. In 
Figure 13.8a, the feedback path is from the output to the 
noninverting input of an almost-ideal op amp, whereas 
the inverting input is grounded, for simplicity. In the 
forward path, vO = Avε (Equation 13.1); from KVL on the 
input side, ε = vP – vN = vP, since vN = 0. The feedback 
connection makes vP = vO. If the output voltage vO of the 
op amp tends to increase for some reason, as indicated 
by the upward arrow next to vO at the extreme right 
of Figure 13.8b, vP and ε will also increase by the same 
amount as vO through the feedback path. The increase

in ε will increase vO by Av times the initial increase in vO, 
through the forward path. Thus, an initial change in vO 
in a given direction results in a change in vO in the same 
direction as the initial change. In other words, the feedback 
tends to reinforce the initial change. This type of feed-
back connection is described as positive feedback.
In Figure 13.8c, the feedback path is from the output 
to the inverting input, whereas the noninverting input 
is grounded for simplicity. In the forward path, vO = Avε 
as before; from KVL on the input side, ε = vP – vN = −vN, 
since vP = 0. The feedback connection makes vN = vO. If 
vO tends to increase, as indicated by the upward arrow 
next to vO at the extreme right of Figure 13.8d, vN will 
increase, but since ε = −vN, ε will increase in the negative 
direction through the feedback path, and vO will also 
increase in the negative direction through the forward 
path. Thus, an initial change in vO in a given direction 
results in a change in vO in the direction opposite that of 
the initial change. In other words, the initial change is 
opposed. This type of feedback connection is described 
as negative feedback.
The stipulation that vO tends to increase or decrease in 
the preceding argument should be justified. In practice, 
small changes in voltage or current always occur in any 
circuit, without any change in the applied inputs, because 
of “noise” due to random fluctuations in the motion of cur-
rent carriers in any conductor (Section 2.1). The op amp 
output is therefore subject to small fluctuations due to 
noise in the op amp itself, as well as noise in the bias sup-
plies. The input of the op amp is also subject to noise and to 
pickup of extraneous signals or interference from the sur-
roundings through electric or magnetic coupling. It may be 
noted that whereas noise is always present in real circuits, 
it is absent in simulations, unless deliberately introduced.
The presence of positive or negative feedback has a 
decisive effect on the behavior of the op amp circuit. 
Consider, to begin with, the negative feedback circuit 
of Figure 13.8c but with an input voltage VI applied 
between the noninverting input and ground as in 
Figure 13.9a. The output and input of the op amp are 
related in the steady state by the vO-ε characteristic of 
the op amp. From KVL at the input, VI = ε + vN = ε + vO, 
or vO = −ε + VI. As a plot of vO vs. ε, this is the equation 
of a line of slope −1 and intercept VI on both axes as in 
Figure 13.9b. The operating point is the point of intersec-
tion ‘P’ of this line with the vO-ε characteristic of the op 
amp, since the two relations involving vO and ε are satis-
fied at this point. ‘P’, whose coordinates are denoted as 
ε0 and VO0, is the only point of intersection between the 
two plots in this case. It is a stable operating point, or a 
point of stable equilibrium, in the sense that any tendency 
for the input or output to change from their values at ‘P’ 
produces a countereffect that restores these values to ε0 
and vO0. For example, suppose that vO tends to increase 
from VO0 by +ΔvO. This will also increase vN by +ΔvO 
because of the direct connection between input and out-
put through the feedback path. However, an increase 
in vN causes an equal decrease in ε, because ε + vN = VI, 
which is constant. The change +ΔvO thus produces a 
change Δε = −ΔvO. This change at the input in the nega-
tive direction will produce a change of −AvΔvO at the 
output of the op amp that is in a direction opposite that 
of the initial +ΔvO. This means that vO will move back 
toward its initial value VO0. As vO so moves, ΔvO → 0, 
which restores vO and ε to their original values at ‘P’, 
and no further change occurs. Similar considerations 
apply if the initial change in vO is −ΔvO instead of +ΔvO. 
‘P’ is therefore a stable operating point. Moreover, if VI 
is varied over an appropriate range, the negative feedback 
connection allows a stable operating point anywhere in the 
linear region of the vO-ε characteristic of the op amp.
Consider next the positive feedback circuit in 
Figure 13.8a, but with an input voltage VI applied 
between the inverting input and ground, as in 
Figure 13.10a. The output and input of the op amp are 
related in the steady state by the vO-ε characteristic of the 
op amp, as always. From KVL at the input, vP = ε + VI, 
or vO = ε + VI. As a plot of vO vs. ε, this is the equation 
of a line of slope +1 and intercept of magnitude VI on 
both axes (Figure 13.10b). There are now three points of

intersection at which the values of ε and vO satisfy both 
the equation of the line and the vO-ε characteristic of the 
op amp. We will argue that ‘P1’ is an unstable operating 
point if Av > 1 in Figure 13.10, as is almost invariably the case. 
Thus, if vO tends to increase by +ΔvO, vP also increases by 
+ΔvO because of the direct connection between input and 
output through the feedback path. However, an increase 
in vP causes an equal increase in ε, because ε + VI = vP. An 
increase +ΔvO in ε at the input of the op amp will pro-
duce a change of +AvΔvO at the output of the op amp. 
This new value of output is in turn fed back to the input 
and results in a new output (Av)2ΔvO, and so on. Here, 
we have to distinguish two cases: (1) Av < 1, in which 
case the successive changes at the output and input of 
the op amp get progressively smaller, eventually revert-
ing to their original values at ‘P1’. This means that ‘P1’ is a 
stable operating point (Exercise 13.2). (2) Av > 1, in which 
case the successive changes at the output and input of the 
op amp get progressively larger. vO and ε will increase 
very rapidly until they reach the intersection point ‘P2’ 
in the positive saturation region. ‘P2’ is a stable operat-
ing point: vO does not change because of positive satura-
tion; any tendency for ε to change cannot be sustained 
because ε must remain constant to satisfy KVL at the 
input. Similarly, if initially vO tends to decrease by ΔvO 
from its value at ‘P1’, vO and ε will decrease very rapidly 
until they reach the intersection point ‘P3’ in the nega-
tive saturation region. ‘P3‘ is also a stable operating point 
because vO must remain constant. It is seen that with pos-
itive feedback and Av > 1, two stable states are possible, 
corresponding to intersection points ‘P2’ and ‘P3’ that are 
not within the linear operating region of the op amp. The 
op amp can be used in this case as a switch, where the 
two saturation states correspond to the two stable states 
of the switch: open or closed. Although switching can 
occur without positive feedback, by applied small posi-
tive and negative values of ε, positive feedback increases 
the switching speed and enhances performance.
Note that in Figure 13.10, the gain around the feed-
back loop is Av × 1 = Av, where the “1” for the feedback 
path is due to the fact that all of vO is applied to the 
noninverting input (vP = vO). In the general case, where 
only a fraction of the output is fed back to the input, 
the preceding argument applies to the gain around the 
feedback loop, rather than to the amplifier gain Av alone. 
Thus, if Av = 2 and only a quarter, say, of the output is 
applied to the noninverting input (vP = 0.25vO), the loop 
gain is 2 × 0.25 = 0.5. A change of ΔvO in the output is fed 
back as a change of 0.5ΔvO. The positive feedback config-
uration is stable in this case, despite the fact that Av = 2.
The use of negative feedback in amplifying-type op 
amp circuits is, in contrast to switching-type op amp 
circuits, imperative for two reasons: (1) it allows stable 
operation in the linear region of the vO-ε characteristic of 
the op amp, and (2) It confers some desirable properties 
on the op amp circuit, as explained later. Hence, the 
­following concept applies:
Concept: Nonswitching op amp circuits invariably employ 
negative feedback, which necessitates some circuit connection 
between the output and the inverting input of the op amp.
The negative feedback circuit connection between 
the output and the inverting input could be a direct 
connection, as in the case of the unity-gain amplifier 
(Figure 13.18), or the connection could be through a sin-
gle circuit element or a combination of circuit elements.
It must not be assumed, however, that negative feed-
back systems are always stable. The preceding dis-
cussion assumes no delays, or phase shift, around the 
feedback loop. If the phase shift around the feedback 
loop is 180°, the feedback changes sign and becomes 
effectively positive. If the loop gain under these condi-
tions exceeds unity, the negative feedback system will 
be unstable.
There are two basic op amp configurations that employ 
negative feedback, namely, the noninverting and the 
inverting configurations. In the noninverting configura-
tion, the feedback signal is in series with the input signal, 
whereas in the inverting configuration, the feedback sig-
nal is effectively in shunt with the input signal. These con-
figurations are discussed in the following two sections.
Exercise 13.2
Plot the vO-ε characteristic of the op amp, with Av < 1, 
and the line relating vO and ε in accordance with KVL at 
the input with positive feedback (Figure 13.10a). Argue 
that the point of intersection is a stable operating point. 
What if Av = 1?
Ans. If Av < 1, the change in output is not sufficient to 
sustain the change in input. If Av = 1, the two lines coin-
cide over the linear range of the op amp characteristic. 
Theoretically, this is neutral equilibrium. In practice, Av 
cannot be exactly 1.
Exercise 13.3
An argument similar to that used with positive feedback 
(Figure 13.10) is sometimes applied to negative feedback 
(Figure 13.9), namely, that if vO changes by ΔvO, ε changes 
by −ΔvO, and vO changes by −AvΔvO, then by +(Av)2ΔvO, 
−(Av)3ΔvO, and so on, which seemingly makes ‘P’ in 
Figure 13.9 unstable. What is wrong with this argument?
Ans. If vO changes by −AvΔvO, then vO moves to the 
other side of ‘P’, through zero. But as it approaches ‘P’, 
ΔvO → 0. When ΔvO = 0, there is no tendency for vO to 
move in the opposite direction, and vO will stop at ‘P’.

13.3  Noninverting Configuration
Figure 13.11 illustrates an almost-ideal op amp con-
nected in the noninverting configuration. The input vI is 
applied directly to the noninverting terminal, whereas 
the inverting terminal is connected to a voltage divider 
across the op amp output. This means that not all of vO, 
but a fraction of it, is fed back to the inverting input. 
That is, vN = βvO, where β is the feedback factor. Because 
the inverting input, by definition of an ideal op amp, 
does not draw any current; it follows from simple volt-
age division that

It is desired to derive the relation between the output 
voltage vO and the input voltage vI. The governing equa-
tions are (1) the vO-ε characteristic of the op amp over 
the linear range, represented by the equivalent circuit, 
and (2) KVL at the input:

with vP  =  vI and vN  =  βvO. Note that according to 
Equation 13.7, vN subtracts from vP to give ε. This is char-
acteristic of a series connection in which voltages add 
algebraically (Section 2.9). Substituting for vP and vN, in

If, for example, Rr = 1 kΩ, Rf = 4 kΩ, then β = 1/5. If Av = 105, 
which is typical for a general-purpose, low-frequency 
op amp, then vO/vI = 105/(1 + (105)/5) = 4.99975 ≅ 1/β. 
It is seen from Equation 13.9 that the voltage gain vO/vI 
cannot be less than unity.
It may be wondered at this stage, and quite legiti-
mately, as to the wisdom of starting with an op amp of 
high voltage gain, such as 105, and ending with an ampli-
fier circuit having a much smaller voltage gain, say, 5 or 
100. Are we throwing away voltage gain for nothing? If a 
certain value of gain is required for a given application, 
why not design the op amp for this value of gain and get 
done with it? For example, a stable and precise value of 
voltage gain of 1.125 is required in digital thermometers, 
so why not design op amps for this application having 
Av = 1.125? The answer is that the gain Av of the op amp 
cannot be precisely defined, because of manufacturing 
tolerances, that is, inevitable variations in the properties 
of components during the manufacturing process. These 
variations can be extremely difficult and costly to con-
trol to a high degree of precision. Moreover, the value of 
Av is subject to variations during normal use of the op 
amp, due to various factors such as (1) changes in inter-
nal components because of environmental effects, such 
as temperature and humidity, or due to “aging,” which 
is some variation in the properties of these components 
with time, because of some long-term physical or chemi-
cal changes, or (2) variations in bias voltages, as when bat-
teries begin to run down. When an op amp of very large 
Av is connected as in Figure 13.11, or in other negative 
feedback configurations as will be demonstrated later, 
the gain is no longer determined by Av but by resistance 
values, as in Equation 13.9. Discrete-component resistors 
can be accurate to 0.01% and highly stable. IC resistors 
have a larger tolerance, typically between 5% and 20%, 
but the ratio of resistances, as in Equation 13.9, is at least 
an order of magnitude more precise than the values of 
individual resistances in the same integrated circuit. 
Consequently, when precision amplification is required, 
it is highly advantageous to trade off the high gain of an 
op amp for a precise and stable value of amplification.
The preceding discussion underscores a concept that is 
of great practical importance, utilizing negative feedback:
Concept: By employing negative feedback, op amp circuits 
can be designed to trade off the high voltage gain of the op amp 
for some desirable characteristics of the circuit.
High gain in IC op amps is quite inexpensive and can 
be advantageously traded off, not only for precision and 
stability of voltage gain, as illustrated by the noninverting

(13.10)
Equation 13.10 can be derived directly by applying a 
very important concept that greatly facilitates the analy-
sis of ideal op amp circuits. Recall that in this case the 
equivalent op amp circuit is not applicable, because 
Av ® ¥.
In Figure 13.11, ε = vO/Av, as is true, by definition, of all 
op amp circuits (Equation 13.1). If Av ® ¥, then ε → 0 for 
finite vO. A zero differential input ε implies a virtual short 
circuit between the noninverting and inverting terminals 
of the op amp; that is, these two terminals are at the same 
voltage, without being physically connected together. 
This virtual short circuit is indicated by the dotted connec-
tion between the two input terminals in Figure 13.12. It is 
seen that one can immediately write vI = vN, with vN = βvO. 
Eliminating vN gives vO = vI/β, as in Equation 13.10.
This concept can be readily generalized as follows:
Concept: In a negative feedback connection employing 
an ideal op amp (Av → ∞), the differential input is vanish-
ingly small for any finite output, so that the two inputs of the 
op amp are at the same voltage and can be considered to be 
virtually short-circuited to one another.
It should be emphasized that the virtual short circuit 
is not a physical connection between the inverting and 
noninverting terminals. Although these terminals are 
maintained at the same voltage by the negative feed-
back, no current flows through the virtual short circuit. 
Resistors that are effectively in parallel because of a vir-
tual short circuit have the same voltage across them as when 
they are physically in parallel. However, because a vir-
tual short circuit does not pass any current, the distribu-
tion of currents in the rest of the circuit is different in the two 
cases, which means that the circuits behave differently 
altogether. The distribution of currents in the case of a 
virtual short circuit is illustrated in Example 13.9.
With Av → ∞, the output can be considered as an ideal, 
independent voltage source of voltage vO, in accordance 
with the substitution theorem.
Example 13.2:  Noninverting Configuration
It is required to determine VO and IO in Figure 13.13, 
assuming an ideal op amp.
Solution:
With the virtual short circuit between the noninverting 
and inverting terminals, VN = VP = 6 V. From voltage divi-
sion, VN = VO(2/3). It follows that VO = (3/2)VN = 9 V. 
Alternatively, it can be argued that since VN appears 
across the 2 kΩ resistor, I2 = 6/2 = 3 mA. I2 flows through 
the 1 kΩ resistor, producing a voltage drop of 3 V across 
this resistor. It follows that VO = 3 + 6 = 9 V. Note that 
as with an ideal voltage source, VO is independent of IO 
and hence does not depend on whatever is connected to 
the output of the ideal op amp.
From KVL around the mesh at the output of the 
op amp, the current in the upper 2 kΩ resistor is I1 = 
(9 – 5)/2 = 2 mA. It follows from KCL at the output 
node that IO = 2 + 3 = 5 mA.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 13.14 
using the part OPAMP from the ANALOG library, 
without changing the default values of Av, VCC
+ , and VCC
- . 
The 1u resistor added at the output of the op amp is 
simply to have PSpice display the output current of the 
op amp. To run the simulation, select ‘Bias Point’ under 
‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation Settings dialog box. 
After the simulation is run, pressing the V and I but-
tons displays the values shown in Figure 13.15. Note 
that the 9 V output is less than the default VCC
+  of 15 V, 
which confirms that the op amp operates in the linear 
region of its vO-ε characteristic.

13.3.1  Unity-Gain Amplifier
An important special case of the noninverting configu-
ration is the unity-gain amplifier, in which Rf = 0, so 
that the output is directly connected to the inverting 
input (Figure 13.18). Rr across the ideal voltage source 
output of the op amp becomes redundant and is omit-
ted. Rf = 0 makes β = 1, so that Equation 13.8 becomes

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
since  the output voltage follows the input voltage 
because even in the case of an almost-ideal op amp, 
vO  =  vN  ≅  vP. A special symbol is sometimes used for 
a unity-gain amplifier consisting of a triangle marked 
with ‘×1’, as in Figure 13.19b.
The unity-gain amplifier is extremely useful for isolat-
ing a source from a load, as is desirable in many cases. 
Consider, for example, a linear-output voltage source 
connected to a load resistance (Figure 13.19a). From volt-
age division,

(13.12)
It is seen that because of Rsrc, variations in RL affect 
the load voltage vO. Moreover, if RL is comparable to 
or considerably smaller than Rsrc, then vO is signifi-
cantly less than vSRC and the power delivered to the 
load is also significantly reduced. For example, if 
VSRC = 6 V, Rsrc = 1.1 kΩ, and RL = 100 Ω, then vO is only 
(0.1/1.2) × 6 = 0.5 V, and the power delivered to the load 
is (0.5)2/100 ≡ 2.5 mW. Most of vSRC appears across Rsrc, 
and most of the power supplied by the source is dis-
sipated in Rsrc. A unity-gain amplifier can be used as in 
Figure 13.19b to isolate the source from the load. No 
current is drawn from the voltage source, so that this 
source is now ideally terminated by an open circuit. 
Variations in RL do not affect the voltage at the source 
terminals, which remains at vSRC. The output voltage of 
the unity-gain amplifier is vSRC, which is applied to RL, 
so vO = 6 V using the same numerical values. The power 
delivered to the load is (6)2/100 ≡ 360 mW, assuming 
the op amp can handle this power. Another advantage 
is that if the load is an impedance ZL instead of RL, then 
vO is frequency dependent in Figure 13.19a, but not in 
Figure 13.19b. The op amp output in the latter case is 
virtually an ideal voltage source that maintains vSRC irre-
spective of the output current.
Example 13.3:  Unity-Gain Amplifier
It is required to determine VO in Figure 13.20a, assuming 
an ideal op amp.
Solution:
Let the current in the upper branch be IX, as in 
Figure  13.20b. Because of the virtual short circuit, 
VP = VN, so that VO = VN = VP . This means that there is 
no voltage drop between the output terminal and the 
noninverting terminal. From KVL, −IX×1 + 10 = 0, which 
gives IX = 10/1 = 10 mA. Because of the open circuit at 
the op amp input terminals, IX flows in the 2 kΩ resistor. 
It follows that VP = 2 × 10 = 20 V and VO = VP = 20 V.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 13.21 
using the part OPAMP from the ANALOG library. To 
maintain operation in the linear region of the input–­
output characteristic, VCC
+  is changed to 25 V from its 
default value of 15 V. There is no need to change Av nor 
VCC
- , which only changes the level of the negative satu-
ration region. To run the simulation, select ‘Bias Point’ 
under ‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation Settings dialog 
box. After the simulation is run, pressing the V and I 
buttons displays the values shown in Figure 13.21.

The following example illustrates the analysis of the 
noninverting configuration using a signal-flow ­diagram. 
Such diagrams can serve as useful aids in investigating 
the behavior of feedback systems.
★Example 13.4:  Signal-Flow Diagram 
for Noninverting Configuration
It is required to analyze the noninverting configuration 
using a signal-flow diagram.
Analysis:
	
1.	The variables of interest are identified and sur-
rounded by circles. In the case of the noninverting 
configuration of Figure 13.11, the variables of 
interest are vI. vP, vN, vO, and ε, shown encircled in 
Figure 13.22a.
	
2.	The circles are joined by lines with arrows pointing 
in the direction of signal flow.
	
3.	In the noninverting configuration, the signal flow 
is from vI (which equals vP), via ε, to vO in the for-
ward path and then through vN and back to ε in the 
feedback path.
	
4.	The lines joining the encircled variables are labeled 
with multiplying factors in accordance with the rela-
tionship between the variables in the direction of sig-
nal flow. Thus, the line joining vI to vP is labeled with 
1, since vP = vI × 1, and the line joining ε to vO is labeled 
with Av because vO = ε × Av. The relation ε = vP – vN is 
represented by a label of 1 on the line joining vP to ε 
and by a label of −1 on the line joining vN to ε.
The following should be noted:
	
1.	The convergence of two or more lines on an 
encircled variable signifies weighted addition or 
­subtraction of the encircled variables of origin of 
the convergent lines.

2.	The sign of the feedback is that of the product of the 
labels around the feedback loop. In Figure 13.22a, 
the feedback is from ε to vO and back through vN 
to ε. The product of the labels around the loop is 
(−1)  ×  Av, which has a negative sign denoting a 
negative feedback.
	
3.	The product of the labels in a signal path is the 
gain along the path. Thus, 1 × Av = Av is the gain in 
the forward path, or the forward gain, from vI to vO, 
whereas (−1) × Av × β = −βAv is the gain around the 
feedback loop, or the loop gain.
Evidently, the signal-flow diagram provides a graphi-
cal representation of the relations between the variables 
involved. The question therefore arises as to whether it 
is possible to derive directly from the diagram the rela-
tion between any two variables. Indeed, this is possible, 
using some well-defined rules. It ­suffices for our pur-
poses to use the following simple rule:
Rule: The value of a given variable equals the value of another 
variable upstream along the signal path, multiplied by the for-
ward gain between these variables and divided by (1 – loop 
gain) of any feedback loop encountered anywhere along the 
path between the two variables, as long as the variables in the 
loop do not have additional inputs.
	
	
(13.13)
In Figure 13.22a, for example, the forward gain from vI 
to vO is 1 × Av = Av , and the loop gain around the feedback 
loop is −βAv. The variables in the loop, ε, vO, and vN do 
not have inputs additional to those under ­consideration. 
Hence, according to Rule 13.13, vO/vI  =  Av/(1  +  βAv), 
which is the same as Equation 13.8.
It is seen that signal-flow diagrams can be very conve-
nient in that they can be derived directly from the circuit 
diagram and allow a simple formulation of the relations 
between the variables involved, without having to write 
and solve equations. Intermediate variables that are not 
of immediate interest can be omitted from the signal 
flow diagram, with the lines appropriately relabeled. 
For example, vP can be omitted from Figure 13.22a, and 
the line from vI to ε labeled 1 × 1 = 1. Similarly, vN can be 
omitted, and the line from vO to ε labeled (−1) × β = −β 
(Figure 13.22b). This simplifies the diagram without los-
ing significant information.
Primal Exercise 13.9
Determine VO in Figure 13.23.
Ans. 15 V.
13.4  Inverting Configuration
The basic inverting configuration is shown in Figure 
13.24. The noninverting input is connected to common 
ground, and negative feedback is provided by the resis-
tance Rf between the output terminal and the inverting 
terminal. The circuit will first be analyzed assuming an 
ideal op amp. As explained in connection with Figure 
13.12, a virtual short circuit exists between the two 
input terminals of an ideal op amp in the presence of 
negative feedback. Because the noninverting terminal is 
grounded, the virtual short circuit becomes in this case 
a virtual ground at the inverting terminal. This is indi-
cated by the dashed ground symbol at the inverting ter-
minal in Figure 13.24.
The virtual ground is a most important feature of 
the inverting configuration, as will become clear in 
the next section. The virtual ground has two critical 
implications:
	
1.	The inverting terminal is effectively at a ground 
voltage of zero. This means that the input current 
ir is determined entirely by the circuit on the input

2.	Because of the open circuit at the inverting 
terminal, ir flows through Rf irrespective of Rf. 
Recall from the definition of an ideal cur-
rent source that if a resistor is connected to an 
ideal current source, the current in the resis-
tor is determined by the source irrespective of 
the resistance value. Since ir is forced to flow 
through Rf irrespective of Rf, then Rf sees an 
ideal current source ir.

(13.16)
It is seen that the sign of vO is opposite that of vI, which 
gives the inverting configuration its name. The inversion 
is basically because the input is applied to the inverting 
input, albeit through a circuit element Rr in this case.
We will next analyze the inverting configuration 
assuming an almost-ideal op amp. Because the nonin-
verting terminal is grounded, it is convenient to define 
εn = −ε (Figure 13.25), so that vO = −Avεn for the op amp. 
Since εn is a function of vI and vO, it is instructive to 
derive the vO–vI relation by superposition, rather than 
KVL and KCL (Exercise 13.20), as this provides better 
insight into the behavior of the circuit. To do so, vI is 
applied alone with vO set to zero (Figure 13.26a), then vO 
is applied alone, with vI set to zero (Figure 13.26b).
vO should not be set to zero by short-circuiting the 
output of the op amp, as this would short-circuit an 
ideal voltage source, leading to an infinite current. But 
we can imagine that the op amp is modified to have 
Av = 0 (Figure 13.26a), which gives vO = 0, so that the 
output is effectively grounded. It follows from voltage 
division that

To apply vO with vI set to zero, it is best to disconnect 
the op amp output and apply a voltage source vO as 
in Figure 13.26b, where vO = –εn2Av. This would avoid 
connecting the ideal voltage source vO in parallel with 
the voltage source εn2Av at the output of the op amp 
although theoretically, the two sources have the same 
voltage. It follows from Figure 13.26b, with vI = 0, that

as in Equation 13.16. It should be noted that even in the 
case of an almost-ideal op amp, the inverting configu-
ration is, for most practical purposes, a virtual ground. 
Even if Av is relatively low at 104, and vO = 10 V, say, 
then εn = −10/104 ≡ –1 mV. It is seen that the difference 
between the noninverting and inverting configurations, 
in terms of feedback, is that in the noninverting configu-
ration, the feedback signal is effectively in series with 
the applied input and subtracts from it, so that ε = vI – vN 
(Figure 13.11). Thus, the sign in the feedback path is 
negative, and the sign in the forward path is positive 
(vO = εAv), so that the sign of the product around the 
feedback loop is negative, as it should be for a nega-
tive feedback system. In the inverting configuration, 
on the other hand, the feedback signal is effectively in 
shunt with the input, through Rf and Rr and adds to it 
(Figure 13.26 and Equation 13.19, where εn = εn1 + εn2). 
The sign in the feedback path is positive, but the sign 
in the forward path is negative (vO = −εnAv), so that the 
sign of the product around the feedback loop is again 
negative, as it should be for a negative feedback system.
If Rf = Rr, then vO = −vI; the inverting configuration 
becomes a unity-gain inverter.
Equation 13.16 can be readily generalized to the sinu-
soidal steady state, where Rr and Rf are replaced by Zr 
and Zf, respectively, and all voltages and currents are 
considered as phasors (Figure 13.27). Because of the 
virtual ground at the inverting input of the op amp, 
Ir = VI/Zr and flows through Zf, resulting in VO = −ZfIr. 
Eliminating Ir gives

Exercise 13.10
Derive Equation 13.20 using the governing equations: 
vI – εn = Rrir, εn – vO = Rfir, and vO = −Avεn, eliminating ir, 
and εn between these three equations.
Example 13.5:  Inverting Configuration
It is required to determine vO and iO in Figure 13.28, 
assuming an ideal op amp.
Solution:
Because of the virtual ground (Figure 13.29), the cur-
rent through the 15 kΩ resistor is zero, which makes 
the 30 kΩ resistor effectively in parallel with the 
20 kΩ resistor, since they have the same voltage across 
them. The parallel resistance is (30) × (20)/50 = 12 kΩ. 
Rr  =  (8  +  12)  =  20 kΩ, and the input current is 
6/20 = 0.3 mA. By current division, the current in the 
30 kΩ resistor is 0.3  ×  (20/50)  =  0.12  mA. This cur-
rent flows through the 100 kΩ resistor and produces 
a voltage drop of (100) × 0.12 = 12 V. It follows that 
vO = −12 V.
The currents in the 50 and 20 kΩ connected to the 
­output of the op amp are 0.24 and 0.6 mA, respectively, 
so that −iO = 0.12 + 0.24 + 0.6 = 0.96 mA.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 13.30 
using the part OPAMP from the ANALOG library, 
without changing the default values. As in Figure 
13.14, the 1u resistors are added in order to have PSpice 
display the currents. To run the simulation, select ‘Bias 
Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation Settings 
dialog box. After the simulation is run, pressing the 
V and I buttons displays the values shown in Figure 
13.30. It is seen that, except for the voltage at the 
inverting terminal and the current through the 15 kΩ 
resistor, which are effectively zero, the indicated cur-
rents and voltages are the same as those assuming an 
ideal op amp. Note that en = - -

★Example 13.6:  Signal-Flow Diagram 
for Inverting Configuration
It is required to analyze the inverting configuration 
using a signal-flow diagram.
Analysis: The signal-flow diagram can be derived 
directly from Figure 3.25. The main variables of 
interest are vI, εn, and vO (Figure 13.35). For the op 
amp, vO = −Avεn. If vO = 0, it follows from Figure 13.26a 
that εn1 = RfvI/(Rr + Rf). When vI = 0, it follows from 
Figure 13.26b that εn2 = RrvO/(Rr + Rf) = βvO. The loop 
gain is βAv, the same as in the noninverting configura-
tion (Figure 13.22b), but the negative sign is now asso-
ciated with the forward path rather than the feedback 
path, as in the inverting configuration. Applying Rule

Configuration
13.5.1  Current-Source-to-Voltage-Source Converter
The circuit of Figure 13.36 converts a nonideal current 
source of source resistance Rsrc, connected to the input 
of an op amp in the inverting configuration, to an ideal 
voltage source at the output. Because of the virtual 
ground, no current flows in Rsrc. The current source is 
ideally terminated with a short circuit, so that all of iSRC 
flows toward the inverting input and through Rf, result-
ing in an ideal voltage source output of vO = −RfiSRC.

13.5.2  Ideal Integrator

13.5.3  Ideal Differentiator
It is evident from Figure 13.38 that if Cf is replaced by an 
inductor, the circuit becomes a differentiator. However, 
the use of inductors is avoided in practice as much 
as possible in favor of capacitors for several reasons: 
(1)  inductors are bulky and expensive compared to 
capacitors, (2) practical capacitors are generally closer 
to the ideal than practical inductors, and (3) capacitors 
of relatively small capacitance can be incorporated in 
integrated circuits, whereas this is much less practical 
with inductors. Differentiation can be obtained by inter-
changing the resistor and capacitor in Figure 13.38, as 
illustrated in Figure 13.39.

Ans. vO(t) is shown in Figure 13.41.
13.5.4  Adder
The virtual ground can act as a summing point, lead-
ing to an adding circuit, as illustrated in Figure 13.42 for 
three inputs. Because of the virtual ground, ir1 = vI1/Rr1, 
ir2  =  vI2/Rr2, and ir3  =  vI3/Rr3. The current ir flowing 
toward the inverting terminal is the sum of the three cur-
rents, ir = ir1 + ir2 + ir3, and flows through Rf. The output is 
vO = −Rfir = −Rf(ir1 + ir2 + ir3). Substituting for the currents

The output voltage is now the sum of the input volt-
ages multiplied by the gain −Rf/Rr. An important fea-
ture of this adding circuit is that the virtual ground 
prevents interaction between the input circuits, thereby 
effectively isolating them from one another. A change in 
vI1 or Rr1, for example, affects only ir1 and has no effect on 
the other input circuits.
If subtraction of some inputs is required, these inputs can 
be inverted before being applied to the adder. Alternatively, 
a difference amplifier (Section 13.6) can be used.
Primal Exercise 13.18
Determine VO in Figure 13.43.
Ans. −10 V.
Example 13.7:  Noninverting Integrator
It is required to analyze the circuit of the noninverting 
integrator of Figure 13.44.
Analysis: The circuit is noteworthy in several respects: 
(1) the integrated output is not inverted, (2) the value of 
Cf can be magnified by a multiplying factor, and (3) the 
inverting input of the integrator is a virtual ground, 
rather than the noninverting input. This is because the op 
amp on the right is in the inverting configuration, having 
an input vO and an output vO2 = −(Rb/Ra)vO (Figure 13.45). 
Due to this inversion in the feedback path, the forward 
path through the op amp should be noninverting, so as

to have a negative feedback loop. The inverting terminal 
of the integrator op amp should therefore be grounded. 
For a finite vO, the voltage at the noninverting input ter-
minal of the op amp is vanishingly small, which means 
that this terminal is a virtual ground (Figure 13.45).
It is seen from Figure 13.45 that vO2 = −(Rb/Ra)vO and 
that ir = vI/Rr; ir flowing through Cf produces a voltage

Cf is thus multiplied by Rb/Ra, the magnitude of the 
gain of the inverting amplifier, and vO is not inverted 
with respect to vI.
Simulation: Suppose that Rr = 100 kΩ, Cf = 1 μF, Rb = 10 kΩ, 
and Ra = 1 kΩ. The circuit is entered as in Figure 13.46 
using the part OPAMP from the ANALOG library, 
­without changing the default values. The source VPWL 
having the parameters indicated is a biphasic pulse vI, as 
in Figure 13.47. To run the simulation, select ‘Time Domain 
(Transient)’ under ‘Analysis type,’ 2 s for ‘Run to time,’ 0 for 
‘Start saving data after,’ and 1m for ‘Maximum step size.’ 
After the simulation is run, the input voltage and output 
voltage are displayed as in Figure 13.47. From Equation 
13.30, the integrator gain is 1/(105 × 10−6 × (10/1)) = 1. The 
integral of the biphasic input pulse of 1 V amplitude and 
1 s duration of each phase is a triangular waveform of 
1 V peak, as in Figure 13.47. Note that the output of the 
inverting amplifier of gain −10 is a triangular waveform 
of −10 V peak, so that the op amp operates in the linear 
region of its characteristic. Note also that the results of 
using the almost-ideal op amp of PSpice are not signifi-
cantly different from those assuming an ideal op amp.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
13.6  Difference Amplifier
The basic circuit of the difference amplifier is shown 
in Figure 13.49. The input vP at the noninverting input 
is simply the output of a voltage divider: vP = RdvSRC1/
(Rc  +  Rd). The current flowing through Ra toward the 
inverting terminal is (vSRC2 – vN)/Ra, and the current 
flowing through Rb away from the inverting terminal 
is (vN – vO)/Rb. From KCL, these currents are equal. 
Moreover, vP = vN because of the virtual short circuit at 
the op amp inputs. Eliminating vP and vN between these 
equations and rearranging gives

The circuit can therefore be used for directly subtract-
ing one signal from another.
The difference amplifier can be considered as a combi-
nation of the inverting and noninverting configurations. 
Accordingly, Equation 13.31 can be derived by superpo-
sition of vSRC1 and vSRC2 (Problem P13.42). Alternatively, 
Equation 13.31 can be derived by applying superposi-
tion of vSRC2 and vO, as in Figure 13.26, to derive vN, and 
then substituting vP = RdvSRC1/(Rc + Rd) for vN.
Example 13.8:  Instrumentation Amplifier
It is required to analyze the circuit of Figure 13.50 repre-
senting an instrumentation amplifier (IA).
Analysis: The amplifier consists of two stages, the first 
stage having two op amps in a noninverting configu-
ration. The outputs of these op amps are combined so 
as to provide a differential output that is applied to a 
difference amplifier in the second stage. Since the input 
sources are applied to noninverting inputs, the input 
impedance is high. Moreover, as is shown in what 
­follows, the overall gain is determined by the value 
of a single resistance R1. The output vO depends on 
the ­difference (vSRC1 – vSRC2) between the inputs. This 
is advantageous, as outside interference that adds the 
same voltage to vSRC1 and vSRC2 is canceled out. For best 
performance, the resistors having the same subscript 
number should be closely matched in value.
The differential gain of the first stage can be very sim-
ply derived by noting that, because the inputs behave 
as open circuits, vP1 = vSRC1 and vP2 = vSRC2 (Figure 13.51). 
Because of the virtual short circuit at the inputs of an 
ideal op amp, vN1  =  vP1  =  vSRC1 and vN2  =  vP2  =  vSRC2.

This means that the voltage (vN1 – vN2) across R1 equals 
the differential input voltage (vSRC1 – vSRC2), so i1 = (vSRC1 – 
vSRC2)/R1. This same current flows in the two resistances 
R2. Hence,

In order to obtain the overall gain, this differential

fier (Equation 13.32). Identifying k, vSRC1, and vSRC2 in 
Equation 13.32, with their counterparts R4/R3, vO1, and

It is seen that the gain can be varied by varying a sin-

to any other resistance. Because of its many attractive 
features, the IA is available in IC form.
Simulation: Suppose that R1  =  2 kΩ and all other 
­resistances are 1 kΩ. From Equation 13.36, the voltage 
gain vO/(vSRC1 – vSRC2) = 2. The circuit is entered as in 
Figure 13.52 using the part OPAMP from the ANALOG 
library, without changing the default values. The VPWL 
sources, having the parameters indicated, are triangular 
waveforms (Figure 13.53). To run the simulation, select 
‘Time Domain (Transient)’ under ‘Analysis type,’ 2s for 
‘Run to time,’ 0 for ‘Start saving data after,’ and 1m for 
‘Maximum step size.’ After the simulation is run, the 
input voltage and output voltage are displayed as in 
Figure 13.53, where vSRC1 and vSRC2 are triangular wave-
forms of amplitudes 3 and 2.5 V, respectively. The out-
put voltage is a triangular waveform of amplitude 1 V.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
★Example 13.9:  Current Distribution 
with Virtual Short Circuit
The objective of this example is to clarify the differ-
ence between having resistors physically in parallel and 
having them effectively in parallel through a virtual 
short-circuit, using the circuit of Figure 13.55.
Analysis: Since the op amp is assumed ideal, a virtual 
short circuit exists between the inverting and nonin-
verting inputs (Figure 13.56). From voltage division, 
VP = 6 × 2/3 = 4 V, so that VN = VP = 4 V. Note that 
the 4 and 1 kΩ resistors are effectively in parallel: they 
have the same 2 V across them, resulting in currents of 
0.5 and 2 mA through these resistors. However, when 
applying voltage division, the 1 kΩ resistor is consid-
ered to be in series with the 2 kΩ resistor, since no cur-
rent flows through the virtual short circuit. The 0.5 mA 
current through the 4 kΩ resistor flows through the 3 kΩ 
resistor, producing a voltage drop of 1.5 V. It follows that 
VO = VN – 1.5 = 2.5 V.
What exactly is the difference between having the 
1 kΩ and 4 kΩ resistors effectively in parallel through a 
virtual short circuit and having them actually in paral-
lel through a physical short circuit, as in Figure 13.57? 
It is clear that the circuit is now a different circuit alto-
gether. Since the inverting and noninverting inputs are 
connected together, the differential input is zero, so 
that VO = 0. With VO = 0, the 3 and 2 kΩ resistors are 
in parallel, having a parallel resistance of 3 × 2/5 = 1.2 
kΩ. The parallel resistance of the 4 and 1 kΩ resistors is 
4 × 1/5 = 0.8 kΩ. By voltage division, the voltage of the 
common op amp inputs is 6 × 1.2/(1.2 + 0.8) = 3.6 V. The 
currents in the circuit are shown in Figure 13.57. With 
VO = 0, the current in the 3 kΩ resistor is 1.2 mA.
In comparing Figures 13.56 and 13.57, the following 
should be noted:
	
1.	The voltage across the 4 and 1 kΩ resistors is the 
same 2  V in Figure 13.56 and the same 2.4  V in 
Figure 13.57, the corresponding currents in the two 
resistors being determined by Ohm’s law in each 
case. In this respect, a physical parallel connection 
and an effective parallel connection behave in the 
same manner in that they have the same voltage 
across them.

2.	However, because a virtual short circuit does not pass 
current, unlike a physical short circuit, the distribu-
tion of currents in the rest of the circuit is different in the 
two cases. This means that the overall circuits are dif-
ferent in the two cases, resulting, in general, in dif-
ferent voltages and currents in each case. As noted 
earlier, the current in the 1 kΩ resistor in Figure 13.56 
flows through the 2 kΩ resistor, and the current in 
the 4 kΩ resistor flows through the 3 kΩ resistor.
It is of interest in this connection to trace the flow of the 
0.5 mA through the 3 kΩ resistor in Figure 13.56, into the 
output of the op amp, and back to the 6 V battery. This 
is illustrated in Figure 13.58, which shows the two VCC 
supplies with their common connection grounded. It fol-

VCC supplies or from applying KCL to surface S2 that 
the 0.5 mA current flows from the ground connections 
of the VCC supplies back to the ground connection of the 
6 V battery. The 0.5 mA current adds to the 2 mA cur-
rent through the 2 kΩ resistor to give 2.5 mA through 
the battery.

Mark the differential input ε in the case of almost-
ideal op amps, and indicate virtual short circuits 
and virtual grounds in the case of ideal op amps. 
Mark op amp input currents and  currents in 
­virtual short circuits as zero, by means of an ‘x’.
	
b.	If the solution requires that a given value of 
current or voltage be satisfied, assume this 
value from the very beginning.
Step 2—Simplify: Try and reduce the circuit to a 
­simpler form, if possible.
Step 3—Deduce: Determine any values of current 
or voltage that follow from immediate, direct 
application of Ohm’s law, KCL, KVL, without 
introducing any additional unknowns. Look for 
the immediate consequences of voltage division 
or current division, as these are encountered 
often in op amp circuits. Pay particular attention 
to implications of virtual short circuits and vir-
tual grounds in the case of ideal op amps. If this 
step does not provide the solution, go to Step 4. 
Steps 2 and 3 can sometimes be alternated.
Step 4—Explore: Consider the nodes and meshes in the 
circuit to see if KCL or KVL can be satisfied by 
assignment of a single unknown current or volt-
age AND if this unknown can then be directly 
determined from KCL or KVL. It is generally 
convenient to select as this single unknown, the 
output voltage of an op amp, or the nonzero 
voltage at the inputs of an ideal op amp that 
is not in the inverting configuration. Once this 
unknown is determined, other required vari-
ables can be derived from KCL, KVL, or Ohm’s 
law. It is helpful in implementing this step to 
bear in mind the following:
	
a.	 The nodes that should be examined are par-
ticularly those at op amp inputs and virtual 
grounds. KCL at op amp output terminals is 
generally not helpful to begin with because 
the output current is not known.
	
b.	 Make use of the output–input relations for 
inverting and noninverting configurations 
based on ideal op amps.
	
c.	 Make use of the vO-ε characteristic (equivalent 
circuit) in the case of almost-ideal op amps.
	
d.	 Avoid introducing additional unknowns 
unnecessarily.
Steps 5 and 6—Plan and Implement are usually 
unnecessary.
Step 7—Check your calculations and results. PSpice 
simulations are very helpful.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Example 13.10:  Two-Stage Amplifier
It is required to determine VO in Figure 13.59.
Solution: The implementation of the steps outlined is 
illustrated in Figure 13.60.
Step 1—Initialize: The circuit parameters and the required 
voltage VO are indicated. The zero input currents are 
indicated by an ‘x’ at the inputs of the op amps. The vir-
tual short circuit at the inputs of the first op amp, and the 
virtual ground at the inverting input of the second op 
amp are indicated and also marked with x to emphasize 
that no currents flow in these virtual connections.
Step 2—Simplify: The circuit is in a simple enough form.
Step 3—Deduce: Because of the virtual ground, the 3 kΩ 
and 6 kΩ resistors connected to the noninverting input 
of the first op amp are effectively in parallel, the parallel 
resistance being 2 kΩ. This parallel resistance, in series 
with the 1 kΩ resistance connected at the input of first 
op amp, is across the 9 V source. The current in the 1 kΩ 
resistor is therefore 3  mA. From current division, the 
currents in the 3 and 6 kΩ resistors are 2  mA and 1 mA, 
respectively. The voltage at the noninverting input of the 
first op amp is from Ohm’s law or voltage division 6 V. 
Because of the virtual short circuit, this is the voltage at 
the inverting input of the first op amp and at the output 
of this op amp, by virtue of the unity-gain follower con-
nection. The current in the 6 kΩ resistor connected to the 
inverting input of the second op amp is therefore 1 mA.
The total current entering the node at the inverting input 
of the second op amp is 1 mA + 2 mA = 3 mA. This current 
flows through the 3 kΩ resistor, producing a voltage drop 
of (3) × 3 = 9 V. Because of the virtual ground, VO = −9 V.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 13.61 using 
the part OPAMP from the ANALOG library, without 
changing the default values. To run the simulation, select 
Bias Point under ‘Analysis type’ in the Simulation Settings 
dialog box. After the simulation is run, pressing the V and I 
buttons displays the values shown in Figure 13.61. It is 
seen that, except for the 9 μV voltage at the inverting ter-
minal of the second op amp, the indicated currents and 
voltages are the same as those assuming an ideal op amp.

Ideal Operational Amplifier

★Example 13.11:  Simulation of Response 
of Practical Op Amp
This example has two objectives: (1) to compare the 
results of simulating a difference amplifier using 
the PSpice part of a popular, general-purpose op amp, 
the uA741, in order to show that the analytical results 
based on ideal op amps give the same results in this case 
and (2) examine the effects of tolerances of resistance 
values. These  tolerances are deviations from nominal 
values due to inevitable variations in the materials and 
processes used in manufacturing the components. The 
tolerance, specified by the manufacturer, is expressed 
as a percentage of the nominal value. For example, the 
actual resistance of a 1 kΩ resistor of 2% tolerance can be 
anywhere in the range of 980–1020 Ω. Commonly used 
resistors have tolerances of 5% or 10%, but resistors of 
0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 20% are available. The 
smaller the tolerance, the more expensive the resistor is.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 13.62 
using the uA741 part from the EVAL library. The only 
additions made to the part, as entered, are the bias 
supplies of ±15 V between pins 4 and 7 and ground. 
The output voltage can be readily calculated assuming 
an ideal op amp. The noninverting terminal (pin 3) is 
at 5 V. Because of the virtual short circuit, the invert-
ing terminal (pin 2) is also at 5 V. The current flowing 
through the 10 kΩ resistor toward the inverting termi-
nal is (6 – 5)/10 = 0.1 mA. This current flows through 
the 10 kΩ feedback resistor, producing a voltage drop 
of 1  V from inverting input to output. It follows that 
VO = 4 V.
To run the simulation, with full sensitivity analy-
sis, select ‘Bias Point’ under ‘Analysis type’ in the 
Simulation Settings dialog box, check the ‘Perform 
Sensitivity analysis’ box under ‘Output File Options,’ 
and enter V(U1:OUT) in the ‘Output variable(s)’ field. 
After the simulation is run, pressing the V and I buttons 
displays the values shown in Figure 13.62. Note that the 
simulated output voltage of 4.000 V agrees with the cal-
culated value of 4 V to within three significant figures 
beyond the decimal point. Note also that the input cur-
rents of the op amp are not zero, but 81.59 and 81.91 nA. 
These are input bias currents of the op amp. Moreover, 
the voltages of the input terminals are 4.999 and 5.000 V. 
This difference is the algebraic sum of ε, the differen-
tial input voltage, and an inherent voltage difference 
referred to as the input offset voltage of the op amp.
It must be emphasized that deviations from the ideal 
can have a drastic effect on some types of op amp cir-
cuits. For example, the aforementioned input bias cur-
rents and offset voltage are themselves integrated by 
the capacitor of an ideal integrator, thereby driving the 
op amp to saturation after a long enough period, even 
with zero input. For this reason, the capacitor in a practi-
cal integrator is usually short-circuited by an electronic 
switch until the start of integration.
The results of the sensitivity analysis are tabulated in 
the output file for all component and parameter values,

Considering R1, for example, the third column indi-
cates that an increase of 1 Ω in R1 decreases (because of 
the minus sign) VO by 5.000 × 10−4 V, conversely if R1 
deceases. The fourth column indicates that an increase 
of 1% in R1 decreases VO by 5.000 × 10−2 V. Similar inter-
pretations apply to the other rows.
To examine the effect of the 2% tolerance, this toler-
ance is entered, as a percentage, in the Property Editor 
Spreadsheet of each of the four resistors, in the respec-
tive row or column. Select ‘DC Sweep’ under ‘Analysis 
type.’ With the ‘Primary Sweep’ box checked and 
‘Voltage source’ selected as the ‘Sweep Variable,’ enter 
the name of the voltage source, V1 or V2, in the ‘Name’ 
field. Under ‘Sweep type,’ with ‘Linear’ selected and 
assuming V1 was chosen as the voltage source, enter 
10 for ‘Start value,’ also 10 for ‘End Value’ and 1 for 
‘Increment.’ Check the ‘Monte Carlo/Worst Case’ box 
under ‘Options,’ which automatically opens a new 
window. Select ‘Worst Case/Sensitivity’ and enter 
V(U1:OUT) in the ‘Output variable’ field. Press the 
‘More Settings’ button, choose the ‘the maximum value 
(MAX)’ from the pull-down menu in the ‘Find’ field, 
and select ‘Hi’ under ‘Worst-Case direction.’ Press the 
‘OK’ buttons and run the simulation. In the ‘Available 
Sections’ window, press the ‘All’ button and then the 
‘OK’ button. The output file shows the results of a lim-
ited sensitivity analysis for the four resistors, indicat-
ing a maximum output voltage of 4.235 V, or 105.88% 
of nominal, for worst-case combination of tolerances.
To find the minimum voltage for the worst-case combi-
nation of tolerances, the preceding procedure is repeated, 
except that after pressing ‘More Settings’ button, choose 
‘the minimum value (MIN)’ from the pull-down menu 
in the ‘Find’ field, and select ‘Low’ under ‘Worst-Case 
direction.’ After running the simulation, the output file 
shows a minimum output voltage of 3.7548 V, or 93.877% 
of nominal, for worst-case combination of tolerances.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 An op amp is a three-terminal, voltage-­operated 
device whose output voltage is directly pro-
portional to the difference between the volt-
ages applied to its two input terminals: vO  = 
Av(vP – vN) = Avε, where Av is the voltage gain of 
the amplifier and ε is the differential input.
•	 An ideal op amp has the following properties:
	
1.	 The output is an ideal voltage source of 
­voltage vO given by
	
v

with
	
	
2.	 Like an ideal voltage source, the amplifier 
has zero output resistance and can deliver 
any  output voltage or current, at any 
frequency.
	
3.	 Both inputs behave as open circuits.
	
4.	 The op amp is free from all imperfections, 
such as nonlinearities or any form of distor-
tion of the output with respect to the input.
•	 An op amp, like any amplifying device, fun-
damentally amplifies power. Some external 
dc bias supply is needed to provide the dif-
ference between the output power and the 
input power. Power is conserved and KCL is 
satisfied when the bias supplies are taken into 
account.
•	 If Av is assumed finite and the bias supplies 
are taken into consideration, the input–output 
characteristic of the op amp can be divided 
into three regions: (1) a linear region of slope 
Av centered at the origin; (2) a positive satu-
ration region, where the output is clamped at 
VCC
+  and which extends from an input V
A
CC

 to 
more positive inputs; and (3) a negative satu-
ration region, where the output is clamped at 
VCC
-  and which extends from -
-
V
A
CC
v
/
 to more 
negative inputs.
•	 In an almost-ideal op amp, either Av is a finite 
constant or the bias supplies, VCC
+  and VCC
- , have 
finite values or both. In all other respects the 
almost-ideal op amp is ideal.
•	 Over the linear operating range, an almost-ideal 
op amp can be represented by an ideal VCVS of 
voltage Avε.
•	 In a feedback system, part or all of the output is 
fed back to the input so as to modify the behav-
ior of the system in some way. The feedback 

Ideal Operational Amplifier	
393
is positive if a change in the output in a given 
direction results in a change in the output in the 
same direction, which tends to reinforce the ini-
tial change. The feedback is negative if a change 
in the output in a given direction results in a 
change in the output in the opposite direction, 
that is, the initial change is opposed.
•	 Positive feedback in an op amp circuit having a 
loop gain of more than 1 results in stable opera-
tion in the positive and negative saturation 
regions only. The op amp behaves in this case 
like a switch.
•	 Negative feedback allows stable operation 
anywhere in the linear region of the op amp 
characteristic.
•	 Nonswitching op amp circuits invariably 
employ negative feedback, which necessitates 
some circuit connection between the output and 
the inverting input of the op amp. The negative 
feedback allows trading off the high gain of the 
op amp for some desirable characteristics of 
the circuit, such as a precise and stable ampli-
fication that depends on resistance ratios only, 
irrespective of variations in Av and other circuit 
parameters.
•	 In a negative feedback connection employ-
ing an ideal op amp (Av → ∞), the differential 
input is vanishingly small for any finite output, 
so that the two inputs of the op amp are at the 
same voltage and can be considered to be virtu-
ally short-circuited to one another.

op amp, v

, where Rf is the resistance of 
the feedback voltage divider that is connected 
directly to the output of the op amp.
•	 The unity-gain amplifier is a special case of the 
noninverting configuration. It can be advan-
tageously used to isolate a nonideal voltage 
source from a load, so that the load sees an 
ideal voltage source output whose value is 
equal to the open-circuit voltage of the noni-
deal source.

 in phasor notation.
•	 The virtual short circuit between the noninverting 
and inverting terminals of the op amp becomes 
a virtual ground at the inverting terminal in 
the inverting configuration. The virtual ground 
effectively isolates the circuit on the input side 
of the op amp from the circuit connected to the 
output of the op amp, while forcing the input 
current to flow through the output circuit.
•	 The virtual ground is an important feature of the 
inverting configuration that allows a number of 
useful applications such as a current-source-to-
voltage-source converter, an ideal integrator, an 
ideal differentiator, and an adder.
•	 A difference amplifier is essentially a combina-
tion of the inverting and noninverting configu-
rations. It can be combined with a noninverting 
input stage to form a high-performance IA.
•	 The ISDEPIC approach can be advantageously 
adapted to solving problems on op amps.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	In solving problems involving ideal op amps, 
always make use of the virtual short circuit 
between the two inputs.
	
2.	In solving problems involving almost-ideal 
op amps, always check that the op amp is oper-
ating in the linear region of its input–output 
characteristic.
	
3.	A combination of circuit elements connected 
across the voltage source output of an op amp 
does not affect the output voltage of the op amp 
but affects its output current.
	
4.	No current flows through a passive circuit 
­element, or a combination of such elements, 
connected across a virtual short circuit at the 
op amp inputs.

Objective and Overview
A frequency-selective circuit or filter is a circuit intended 
to provide an output that varies with frequency in a 
desired manner. Frequency-selective circuits are an 
important class of electric circuits that are extensively 
used in communications, control, and signal processing 
systems. Understanding the frequency response of such 
circuits is basic to designing frequency selective circuits 
that behave in a desired manner.
The study of frequency response is important for 
another reason. Energy storage elements are present in 
all but the simplest physical systems, whether electrical 
or nonelectrical in nature. These energy storage elements 
make the response frequency dependent. In particu-
lar, the response of practically all physical systems is 
reduced at high frequencies because of inherent physical 
processes that can be represented by shunt capacitance in 
the equivalent electric circuit. The responses of some sys-
tems show pronounced peaks, or resonance, at particular 
frequencies, which can have a major impact on system 
performance. The frequency response is therefore rel-
evant to understanding the behavior of physical systems 
and for taking measures to improve their performance.
This chapter is concerned with the basic frequency 
responses of first-order and second-order circuits, with 
emphasis on understanding the fundamental concepts and 
physical interpretations behind these responses. The chap-
ter begins with some basic assumptions in filter analysis, 
followed by presenting the responses of ideal filters. First-
order filters are then discussed and Bode plots are intro-
duced as a very useful tool for describing the frequency 
response. The four types of second-order responses are all 
analyzed in detail in terms of a series RLC circuit. Duality 
is invoked in deriving the responses to parallel first-order 
and second-order circuits. The chapter ends by examining 
some general features of frequency responses.
14.1  Analysis of Filters
The passive filters considered in this chapter consist, in 
general, of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and depen-
dent sources. Independent source excitation is only 
present at the input terminals and the output is taken at 
a designated pair of terminals.
The following assumptions are made in the basic 
­analysis of filters:
	
1.	The input to the filter is a sinusoidal function of 
time having a fixed amplitude and phase angle, 
but a frequency that can be varied over a range 
that may extend from zero (dc) to a virtually 
infinite value.
	
2.	The input is assumed to have been applied for 
a long time, so that the filter output is derived 
under sinusoidal, steady-state conditions.
It follows from these assumptions that phasor methods 
(Chapter 8) provide an appropriate tool for analyzing fil-
ters. The filter is represented in the frequency domain, 
and all currents and voltages are designated as phasors. 
The object of the analysis is to determine how the out-
put of the filter varies in amplitude and phase as the fre-
quency of the input is varied over a specified range, while 
keeping the amplitude and phase of the input constant.
Because variation with frequency is of primary inter-
est, it is customary to represent phasor voltage and 
currents in a filter as functions of jω. This is illustrated 
in Figure  14.1, where the filter input and output are 
denoted as VI(jω) and VO(jω), respectively, bearing in 
mind that the filter input or output could be current 
rather than voltage. The frequency response of the filter 
is generally expressed as the ratio of the output voltage 
or current to the input voltage or current and is referred 
to as the transfer function, H(jω), of the filter. Although 
the transfer function has a special meaning that will 
be elaborated in Section 22.3, in connection with the 
Laplace transform, we will, for present purposes, define 
the transfer function H(jω) in the frequency domain as 
follows:
Definition: The transfer function H(jω) in the frequency 
domain is the ratio of the phasor of the designated output to 
the phasor of a single input applied to the filter.

The frequency response of the filter is therefore 
expressed in terms of the magnitude |H(jω)| of the trans-
fer function and its phase angle θ. It should be emphasized 
that the transfer function expressed by Equation 14.1 is 
derived under two conditions: (1) the filter does not have 
any independent sources other than at the input and (2) 
the filter is in a sinusoidal steady state, which implies that 
any initial conditions in the circuit have died out.
14.2  Ideal Frequency Responses
Frequency selectivity arises because of the presence of 
energy storage elements, which could be capacitors or 
inductors. As explained in Section 8.4, these energy stor-
age elements, by virtue of their reactance, make the volt-
ages and currents in a circuit depend on frequency. It is 
this frequency dependence that underlies the frequency 
selectivity of filters, as will be demonstrated in the fol-
lowing sections.
There are four basic frequency responses of filters, 
as illustrated in Figure 14.2a through d, in terms of 
|H(jω)| for the ideal cases. Figure 14.2a is the response 
of an ideal low-pass filter. As its name implies, all fre-
quencies between 0 (dc) and a cutoff frequency ωcl are 
passed through the filter without attenuation, that is, 
with |H(jω)| = 1, which makes the magnitude of the 
output equal to that of the input. This range of frequen-
cies from zero to ωcl is the passband. At frequencies 
above ωcl, the output is zero, that is, |H(jω)| = 0. These 
frequencies constitute the stopband.
Figure 14.2b is that of an ideal high-pass filter. 
|H(jω)| = 0 over the stopband, from dc up to a cut-off 
frequency ωch, but |H(jω)| = 1 in the passband, for fre-
quencies greater than ωch. The response of Figure 14.2c 
is that of an ideal bandpass filter. The passband, hav-
ing |H(jω)| = 1, is for frequencies in the range ωcl to ωch, 
whereas the stopband, having |H(jω)| = 0, extends over 
the lower and higher frequencies outside this range. 
Finally, the response of Figure 14.2d is that of an ideal 
bandstop filter. The stopband, having |H(jω)| = 0, is for 
frequencies in the range ωcl to ωch, whereas the passband, 
having |H(jω)| = 1, extends over the lower and higher 
frequencies outside this range. It should be emphasized 
that the responses in Figure 14.2a through d are ideal 
and cannot be physically realized. However, they can be 
closely approached by various filter designs.
The four types of filter responses illustrated in 
Figure 14.2 are interrelated. For example, if a low-pass 
response of cutoff frequency ωcl is subtracted from unity, 
a high-pass response of the same cutoff frequency is 
obtained and conversely (Figure 14.3a). Similarly, if a 
bandpass response is subtracted from unity, a bandstop 
response of the same cutoff frequencies is obtained and 
conversely (Figure 14.3b). In this sense, the low-pass 
response is the complement of the high-pass response 
with respect to unity and conversely, as will be dem-
onstrated later for a first-order circuit. Similarly, the 
bandpass response is the complement of the bandstop 
response with respect to unity and conversely, as will be 
demonstrated later for a second-order circuit.

Frequency Responses	
409
Consider next a low-pass response of cutoff frequency 
ωcl and a high-pass response of cutoff frequency ωch, 
with ωch < ωcl (Figure 14.3c). If these two responses are 
multiplied together, the result is a bandpass response 
having a passband from ωch to ωcl. This follows from the 
fact that for ω < ωch, the zero response of the high-pass 
filter when multiplied by the unity response of the low-
pass filter gives a zero response. Similarly, for ω > ωcl, 
the zero response of the low-pass filter when multiplied 
by the unity response of the high-pass filter gives a zero 
response. But for ωch < ω < ωcl, both responses are unity, 
and their product is unity.
If a low-pass response of cutoff frequency ωcl is added 
to a high-pass response of cutoff frequency ωch, with 
ωcl < ωch, the resulting response is bandstop having a 
stopband from ωcl to ωch (Figure 14.3d). This is because 
the response is zero in the range ωcl < ω < ωch, where 
both responses are zero. Outside this range, one of the 
responses is unity, so their sum is unity.
Finally, a bandpass response results from subtract-
ing a low-pass response of cutoff frequency ωc1 from 
another low-pass response of cutoff frequency ωc2 > ωc1 
(Figure  14.3e). Similarly, a bandpass response results 
from subtracting a high-pass response of cutoff fre-
quency ωc2 from another high-pass response of cutoff 
frequency ωc1 < ωc2 (Figure 14.3f).
The interrelation between the various frequency 
responses will be illustrated and utilized in this and the 
following chapter.
14.3  First-Order Responses
Prototypical first-order filters consist of a single resis-
tor and a single energy storage element, which could be 
a capacitor or an inductor. They are referred to as first 
order because their responses obey a first-order, linear, 
ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, 
as discussed in Chapter 11.
A prototypical, first-order, series capacitive filter is 
illustrated in Figure 14.4a in the frequency domain, 
where the input voltage VI(jω) is the source voltage 
VSRC(jω) and the output voltage VO(jω) is the voltage 
VC(jω) across the capacitor. From voltage division,

Assume that VSRC(jω) remains constant as its fre-
quency is varied. When ω = 0, the capacitor acts as 
an open circuit in the steady state, no current flows, 
VC(jω)  = VSRC(jω), and HC(jω) = 1. As the frequency 
increases, |VC(jω)| decreases continuously, in accor-
dance with Equation 14.3. When w ® ¥, the reactance 
of the capacitor approaches zero, that is, the capaci-
tor acts as a short circuit, VC(jω) → 0, and HC(jω) → 0. 
As discussed in Section 14.2, the response is low pass, 
since high-­frequency signals are attenuated, whereas 
low-frequency signals are transmitted with little 
attenuation.

The response across the resistor is now low pass, since

The response across the inductor is high pass. At ω = 0, 
the inductor acts as a short circuit so that VL(jω) = 0, and 
HL(jω) = 0. As w ® ¥, the inductor acts as an open cir-
cuit, VL(jω) → VSRC(jω), and HL(jω) → 1.
Since the basic first-order circuits of Figures 14.4 and 
14.5 consist of two circuit elements, only two outputs 
are possible from each circuit, one output being low 
pass, the other high pass. This is a general property of 
first-order filters:
Concept: The frequency response of a first-order filter is 
either low pass or high pass, the variation of the response with 
frequency being due to the frequency-dependent reactance of 
energy storage elements.
There are no first-order bandpass or bandstop 
responses, as these responses require two transitions 
between a passband and a stopband. This cannot be 
achieved by a single energy storage element, as will be 
clarified later.
14.3.1  Parallel First-Order Filters
The parallel circuit duals of the first-order series circuits 
of Figures 14.4 and 14.5 are shown in Figure 14.6.
In Figure 14.6a and at ω = 0, the inductor acts as a 
short circuit, and ILp(jω) = ISRC(jω). As ω → ∞, the induc-
tor acts as an open circuit, and IGp(jω) = ISRC(jω). It is to 
be expected, therefore, that the response ILp(jω) is low 
pass and the response IGp(jω) is high pass. The analyti-
cal expressions can be derived from current division or 
from duality. The circuit of Figure 14.6a is the dual of 
that of Figure 14.4, the dual of VC(jω) being ILp(jω) and 
the dual of VR(jω) being IGp(jω). Replacing C by Lp and R 
by Gp in Equation 14.2,

It is seen that the response HLp(jω) is low pass and the 
response HGp(jω) is high pass, as argued previously for a 
first-order circuit.
In Figure 14.6b and at ω = 0, the capacitor acts as an 
open circuit, and IGp(jω) = ISRC(jω). As ω → ∞, the capaci-
tor acts as a short circuit, and ICp(jω) = ISRC(jω). It is to 
be expected, therefore, that the response IGp(jω) is low 
pass and the response ICp(jω) is high pass. The analyti-
cal expressions can be derived from current division or 
from duality. The circuit of Figure 14.6b is the dual of 
that of Figure 14.5, the dual of VL(jω) being ICp(jω) and

It is seen that the response HGp(jω) is low pass and the 
response HCp(jω) is high pass, as argued previously for a 
first-order circuit.
It will be noted that in all the first-order responses 
considered, where the response across one element 
is low pass, the response across the other element is 
high pass, with these two responses being complemen-
tary with respect to the applied source. In Figure 14.4,

= 1. Similar consider-
ations apply to the inductive filter of Figure 14.5 and to 
the parallel circuits of Figure 14.6. This is in accordance 
with what was mentioned in Section 14.2 about the low-
pass and high-pass responses being the complement of 
one another. In a first-order circuit, the sum of the low-
pass and high-pass voltage or current responses is equal 
to the applied source excitation. The low-pass and high-
pass responses are therefore the complement of one 
another with respect to the applied source excitation.
Although it is straightforward to plot the magnitudes 
and phase angles of the aforementioned responses as 
a function of w, it is more useful and convenient, for 
reasons that will become clear later, to use logarithmic 
rather than linear plots. These plots are known as Bode 
plots after Hendrik W. Bode, the engineer who intro-
duced them. We will therefore digress a little to discuss 
Bode plots.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Figure 14.9 illustrates an alternative but a more conve-
nient way of plotting log10 of variables. In Figure  14.8, 
the axes are labeled as log10x or log10y and are scaled 
linearly in terms of log10x or log10y. In contrast, the 
axes in Figure 14.9 are labeled as x or y but are scaled 
­logarithmically as log10x or log10y. Thus, the markings 
on the x-axis are x values of 1, 10, 102, 103, etc. But the 
markings are equidistant along the x-axis, correspond-
ing to a logarithmic scaling on this axis. Each interval 
between successive powers of ten is also scaled logarith-
mically. Thus, the interval 1–10 is shown expanded in 
Figure 14.9. If the length of this interval is denoted as 
‘mn’, the marked value of 2, for example, is scaled as 
log102 = 0.30 and is placed at a distance of 0.30 × ‘mn’ to 
the right of ‘m’. Similarly, the marked value of 5 is scaled 
as log105 = 0.70 and is placed at a distance of 0.70 × ‘mn’ 
to the right of ‘m’. Clearly, this is a more convenient way 
of plotting logarithmic values, because the values of the 
variables are entered directly, without the need to take 
their logarithms. ‘P2’, for example, is entered as (100, 
1000) in Figure 14.9, rather than (log10100, log101000) 
in Figure 14.8. The plot is, of course, the same straight 
line log10y = log100.1 + 2log10x in both cases. The slope of 
the line in Figure 14.9 is (log10105 – log10103)/(log10103 – 
log10102) = log10100/log1010 = 2, as in Figure 14.8.
In Bode magnitude plots, the horizontal axis is labeled 
in terms of ω but is scaled logarithmically as log10ω. 
However, the vertical axis is labeled and scaled linearly 
as 20log10|H(jω)|, so the plot is still log–log. In gen-
eral, the expression 20log10B, where B  is the magnitude 
of a transfer function in terms of voltage or current, 
denotes the dB value of B, where dB is the abbreviation 
of ­decibel. This representation originated in the early 
days of telephony for specifying power loss in cascaded 
circuits, in which the overall power loss is the product 
of the ratios of the power outputs to the power inputs 
of the individual circuits. Using logarithms was con-
venient because (1) it meant that the logarithms of the 
power ratios of the individual circuits could be added 
to obtain the logarithm of the overall power loss of the 
cascaded circuits and (2) it allowed specifying a large 
range of power loss or gain as a much smaller range of 
the logarithm of these values. The decibel was defined 
as 10log10A, where A is a power ratio. Since the power 
ratio for a given resistor is proportional to the square 
of the ratio of voltage or current, 20log10 is used with 
the ratios of voltages and currents. Thus, voltage ratios 
of 103, 104, and 105 are expressed as 60 dB, 80 dB, and 
100  dB, respectively. The advantages of using Bode 
plots for describing the responses of frequency-­selective 
­circuits will become clear from future discussions.

14.4.1  Low-Pass Response
H(jω) for the first-order low-pass response can be 
expressed in normalized form by replacing the time con-
stants RC and L/R by 1/ωcl in all the low-pass transfer 
functions derived so far. All these transfer functions take 
the form

It is desired to plot the magnitude of the response as

they can be approximated by straight-line asymptotes 
for limiting values of ω. To illustrate this feature, con-
sider first the very low values of ω, for which w w

In terms of dB, taking log10 of both sides of Equation

20log10(1)  = 0  dB, which is the equation of the low-­
frequency asymptote, as ω → 0. It is, in fact, the hori-
zontal axis or 0 dB line (Figure 14.10a).

This is the equation of a straight line of the form

a and b are constants. To draw this high-frequency 
asymptote, it is sufficient to identify a point on the line 
and its slope. It  is seen that when ω = ωcl, Equation 
14.18 gives

This means that the high-frequency asymptote passes 
through the point (ωcl, 0 dB). In other words, the high-
frequency asymptote intersects the horizontal axis, that 
is, the 0 dB line, at ω = ωcl, as indicated by point ‘P1’ in 
Figure 14.10a.
To determine the slope of the line, the usual procedure 
can be followed by identifying the two points (x1, y1) and 
(x2, y2) on the line, the slope being (y2 − y1)/(x2 − x1). We 
have already identified one point P1(x1, y1) as (ωcl, 0 dB). 
To identify a second point ‘P2’, consider ω  =  10ωcl. 
Substituting this in Equation 14.18,

It is seen that (y2 − y1) = −20 − 0 = −20 dB. As for 
(x2 − x1), note that in moving from ‘P1’ to ‘P2’, the fre-
quency is increased from ωcl to 10ωcl. In frequency 
terms, multiplying the frequency by 10 is described 
as moving up a decade of frequency, whereas dividing 
the frequency by 10 is moving down a decade of fre-
quency. The slope of the high-frequency asymptote can 
therefore be specified as −20 dB/decade, as indicated 
in Figure 14.10a.
We have thus far identified the low-frequency and 
high-frequency asymptotes of the Bode magnitude plot 
of the first-order, low-pass response, but have not yet 
identified any points on the plot itself. A salient point on 
this plot is obtained by substituting ω = ωcl in Equation 
14.15. This gives

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
A point on the Bode magnitude plot is therefore ‘Q’ 
having coordinates (ωcl, −3 dB), as in Figure 14.10a. 
Because of this, wcl is referred to as the 3 dB cutoff 
frequency. A synonymous term is the half-power fre-
quency, because if we imagine the input to be of con-
stant amplitude but variable frequency and the output 
to be across a fixed resistor R, then at very low frequen-
cies the output voltage may be VO rms, and the average 
power dissipated in R is P
V
R
O
=
2/ . At ω = ωcl, the output 
voltage drops to VO/ 2 rms, and the power becomes 
P/2; hence, the half-power designation. Because ωcl 
is the intersection of the two asymptotes, it is also the 
corner frequency. However, it should be noted that 
whereas the half-power ­frequency is, by definition, the 
same as the 3 dB cutoff frequency, the corner frequency 
is not always the same as the 3 dB cutoff frequency, as 
will be clarified later.
With the asymptotes and the 3 dB cutoff point defined, 
the low-pass Bode magnitude plot of Figure 14.10a can 
be sketched with reasonable accuracy. The accuracy 
can be improved by noting the following: (1) The −3 dB 
at ω = ωcl represents the maximum deviation of the 
plot from the asymptotes; (2) at a frequency of 0.5ωcl,

is, 1 dB below the low-frequency asymptote; and (3) 
at a frequency of 2ωcl, 20log10|H(jω)| is approximately 
1  dB below the high-frequency asymptote (Exercise 
14.8). Changing the frequency by a factor of 2 is 
described as moving through an octave of frequency.
As for the Bode phase plot, it follows from 
Equation 14.14 that the phase angle of H(jω) is that of 
the numerator, which is zero, minus that of the denomi-
nator, which is arctan of the ratio of the imaginary part 
to the real part. Thus,

14.4.2  High-Pass Response
H(jω) for the first-order high-pass response may be 
expressed in normalized form by replacing the time con-
stants RC, L/R, LpGp, and Cp/Gp by 1/ωch in all the high-
pass transfer functions derived so far. All these transfer 
functions take the form

Note that although ωcl and ωch are given by the same 
expression, they refer to two different responses, one 
low pass, the other high pass (Example 14.1). It follows 
from Equation 14.23 that the magnitude and phase of 
the high-pass response can be expressed as

In a manner exactly analogous to the low-pass 
response, the high-frequency asymptote is obtained by 
letting w ® ¥ in Equation 14.24. This gives |H(jω)| = 1 
and 20log101 = 0 so that the high-frequency asymptote 
on the logarithmic plot is the horizontal axis or 0 dB line. 
As ω → 0, |H(jω)| → ω/ωch. On the logarithmic plot, 
the low-frequency asymptote is therefore a line whose 
equation is

(14.26)
Following an argument similar to that used for the 
low-pass response, it is seen that the low-frequency 
asymptote is a line of slope of +20 dB/decade that inter-
sects the horizontal axis, that is, the 0 dB line, at ω = ωch 
(Figure 14.11a). This is also the 3 dB cutoff frequency or 
the half-power frequency. It is also the corner frequency 
in this case.
It follows from Equations 14.23 and 14.25 that the 
Bode phase plot of the high-pass response is that of 
the low-pass response shifted upward by 90°, because 
of the jω term in the numerator of the transfer function 
(Figure 14.11b).
The following should be noted concerning first-order 
responses and the 3 dB cutoff frequencies:
	
1.	In all the preceding first-order transfer func-
tions, the reciprocals of the 3 dB cutoff frequen-
cies are the same as the time constants defined 
in Chapter 11 for the corresponding circuits. 
Fundamentally, this is due to the relationship 
between circuit responses in the time domain 
and in the frequency domain, as exemplified by 
the Laplace transform (Chapter 21).
	
2.	It was pointed out in Section 11.5, that the 
time constant could be derived from the resis-
tance seen by the energy storage element 
when independent sources are set to zero. 

Frequency Responses	
415
This resistance is in fact RTh of TEC seen by 
the energy storage element. The same applies 
to finding the resistance involved in the 3 dB 
cutoff frequency.
	
3.	The 3 dB cutoff frequency can also be deter-
mined from the transfer function in two other 
ways:
	
a.	 From the transfer functions in standard form 
in terms of jω. In this form the denominator 
is (1 + jω term), where the jω term is jω/ωcl 
for a low-pass response and is ωch/jω for a 
high-pass response. It is seen that ωcl is the 
denominator of the term whose numerator 
is jω, and ωch is the numerator of the term 
whose denominator is jω.
	
b.	 From the magnitude of the normalized, stan-
dard form of the transfer function by setting 
this magnitude equal to 1
2
/
 and solving 
for ω. Note that the 3 dB cutoff frequency 
is defined as 3 dB below the maximum value 
of 20log10|H(jω)| in the passband. In the 
normalized form, the maximum value of 
|H(jω)| is unity so that the maximum value 
of magnitude of 20log10|H(jω)| is 0 dB. If 
the transfer function is multiplied by a scalar

of the low-pass response, for example, then 
the maximum value of |H(jω)| in the pass-
band is K, and the value of this magnitude 
at the 3 dB cutoff frequency is K/ 2 and not 
1
2

.
	
4.	The high-pass response (Equations 14.23) can be 
derived from the low-pass response (Equation 
14.14) by interchanging jω and ωc, where ωc is 
the corresponding 3 dB cutoff frequency. This 
is a general principle that will be illustrated in 
other cases as well.
It is clear from the preceding discussion that first-
order responses can only have one cutoff frequency, 
ωcl or ωch. On the other hand, bandpass and bandstop 
responses require two cutoff frequencies, as illustrated 
in Figure 14.2c and d, because there are two transitions 
between the passband and the stopband, with each tran-
sition involving a cutoff frequency. Hence, there are no 
first-order bandpass and bandstop filters.

Example 14.1:  First-Order Responses
Given R = 1 kΩ and C = 0.5 μF in Figure 14.4. Determine 
L in Figure 14.5 for a corner frequency that is 10 times 
that of the RC filter, assuming a resistance of 2 kΩ. 
Obtain by simulation both the low-pass and the high-
pass responses of the RL filter.
Solution:
ωC = 1/RC = 1/(103 × 0.5 × 10−6) = 1000/0.5 = 2 krad/s. 
ωL = 20 krad/s = R/L. Hence, L = (2 kΩ)/(20 krad/s) = 
0.1 H.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 14.12, 
using the source VAC of default magnitude 1 V. The 
resistor is entered as part ‘r’ from the ANALOG_P 
library. This resistor has its terminals marked 1 and 2 
to facilitate plotting the responses. To run the simula-
tion, select ‘AC Sweep/Noise’ for ‘Analysis type’ in the 
Simulation Settings dialog box. Under ‘AC Sweep Type’, 
select ‘Logarithmic’ and enter 100 for ‘Start Frequency’, 
100k for ‘End Frequency’, and 1000 for ‘Points/Decade’. 
After the simulation is run, select in the SCHEMATIC1 
page Trace/Add Trace and then DB() from the right 
window and V(L1:1) or V1(L1) from the left win-
dow so that the entry in Trace expression appears as 
DB(V(L1:1)). The high-pass plot is displayed. To dis-
play the low-pass response and after selecting DB() 
as for the high-pass response, enter V(R1:1) − V(L1:1) 
or V1(R1) − V1(L1) inside the DB parentheses so that 
the entry in Trace expression appears as DB(V(R1:1) − 
V(L1:1)). The two plots appear as in Figure 14.13. To

The following should be noted: (1) fc is the same for 
both responses, since it is L/(2πR) in the same circuit; 
(2) the two responses are symmetrical on a logarithmic 
scale with respect to a line through f = fc, because ω/ωcl 
(or f/fcl) in the low-pass response is replaced by its recip-
rocal ωcl/ω (or fcl/f) in the high-pass response; and (3) 
both asymptotes intersect the 0 dB line at f = fc. This is 
because the equations of the asymptotes are f/fc and fc/f. 
The two asymptotes intersect where f/fc = fc/f or f = fc. At 
this frequency, either ratio is unity, which corresponds 
to 0 dB.

Ans. 1 mA at ω = 0.
14.5  Second-Order Bandpass Response
As defined in Section 12.2, second-order LTI circuits 
are so called because their responses obey a second-
order, linear, ordinary differential equation with con-
stant coefficients. These circuits are of two general 
types: (1)  circuits that are reducible to a series or a 
parallel combination of a resistor, an inductor, and a 
capacitor or (2) circuits that have resistors in combi-
nation with two capacitors or two inductors, where 
these energy storage elements cannot be combined 
into a single capacitor or inductor, as in Figure 11.21, 
for example.
In contrast to first-order frequency responses, which, 
as discussed in Section 14.3, are either low pass or high 
pass, second-order frequency responses can be any of 
the four basic types mentioned in Section 14.2. These 
responses will be discussed using the prototypical series 
RLC circuit illustrated in Figure 14.15. The sinusoidal 
source VSRC(jω) is assumed to be of constant magnitude 
and phase angle, but of variable frequency. The current 
in the circuit and the voltages across the circuit elements 
are phasors.
The impedance seen by the source is the impedance of 
the three elements in series

A striking feature of the combined reactance X in 
Equation 14.28 is that at some frequency, the capacitive 
and inductive reactances are equal in magnitude but 
opposite in sign so that their sum X = ωL − 1/ωC = 0. 
The frequency ω0 at which this occurs is given by

Thus, at the frequency ω0, the series combination of L and 
C acts as a short circuit (X = 0), and Z = R, as illustrated in 
the impedance diagram of Figure 14.16a. At a frequency

tive, with Z

, and 
 
(Figure 14.16c). It is seen that at ω = ω0, Z has a mini-
mum value of R and is purely resistive. With a constant 
magnitude and phase angle of VSCR(jω), it follows from 
Equation 14.28 that at ω = ω0, the current I(jω0) will be 
a maximum and in phase with VSCR(jω0). At frequencies 
that are below or above ω0, |I(jω)| is reduced, with I(jω) 
leading VSCR(jω) at frequencies below ω0, since the net 
reactance is capacitive, and with I(jω) lagging VSCR(jω) at 
frequencies above ω0, when the net reactance is inductive.
Having examined qualitatively the behavior of the 
series RLC circuit of Figure 14.1, the next step is to 
investigate this behavior quantitatively. We will start by

The Bode magnitude and phase plots are shown in 
Figure 14.17a and b for Q = 10 and Q = 5.
It is seen from Equation 14.34 that when ω = ω0, 
|HBP(jω0)| has its maximum value of unity so that 
20log10|HBP(jω)| = 0 dB, irrespective of Q. This is 
because the combination of L and C acts as a short cir-
cuit at this frequency so that VSRC(jω0) appears across R. 
|HBP(jω)| decreases on either side of ω0. At ω = 0, no 
current flows, because C acts as an open circuit, so 
VR(jω) = 0. Similarly, as ω → ∞, L acts as an open circuit, 
so VR(jω) → 0. The frequency response is limited to a 
range of frequencies and is therefore of the bandpass 
type (Figure 14.2c).
Note from Equation 14.34 that because of the term 
(ω/ω0 − ω0/ω)2 in the denominator, |HBP(jω)| at ω/ω0 = k 
has the same as at ω/ω0 = 1/k. On a logarithmic scale, 
ω = kω0 and ω = ω0/k are equidistant, on either side of ω0, 
since log10kω0 = log10ω0 + log10k and log10ω0/k = log10ω0 − 
log10k. This means that 20log10|HBP(jω)| is symmetrical 
about the vertical line through ω = ω0, as in Figure 14.17a. 
Moreover, it follows from Equation 14.34 that as ω → 0,

which means that the high-frequency asymptote of the 
Bode magnitude plot has a slope of −20 dB/decade, as 
for a first-order low-pass response. This is because as 
ω → 0, ωL → 0 so that the circuit reduces to a high-pass 
RC circuit. Similarly, as ω → ∞, 1/ωC → 0 so that the cir-
cuit reduces to a low-pass RL circuit. Equating the RHS’s

of Equations 14.36 and 14.37 gives ω = ω0 as the point of 
intersection of the two asymptotes.
The phase angle is zero at ω = ω0, since the reactances 
cancel out and VR(jω0) = VSRC(jω0). When ω < ω0, the 
capacitive reactance predominates (Figure 14.16b) so 
that the current, and hence VR(jω), leads VSRC(jω). As 
ω → 0, tan∠HBP(jω) → +∞, and ∠HBP(jω) → 90°, as for an 
ideal capacitor. When ω > ω0, the inductive reactance pre-
dominates (Figure 14.16c) so that the current, and hence 
VR(jω), lags VSRC(jω). As ω → ∞, tan∠HBP(jω) → −∞, and 
∠HBP(jω) → −90°, as for an ideal inductor.

For a given ω0, the larger the Q, the narrower the BW 
is, that is, the sharper the peak of the bandpass response 
is, as in Figure 14.17a. If the BW does not exceed 10% 
of the center frequency, corresponding to a Q of at 
least 10, the bandpass response is usually described as 
narrowband.
The pronounced peaking of the frequency response at 
some frequency ω0 is described as resonance, ω0 being 
the resonant frequency. As illustrated earlier, reso-
nance results in a bandpass response that allows selec-
tion of a relatively narrowband of frequencies out of a 
wide range of frequencies that may be present. Because 
of this, a resonant circuit is also referred to as a tuned 
­circuit. More elaborate, near-ideal bandpass responses 
are used in radio, television, and communication receiv-
ers to select or tune to particular stations or channels. 
Dynamical systems, in general, exhibit resonance, which 
could be quite pronounced if Q is high. A structure, such 
as a bridge, may resonate at some frequency. If excited at 
this frequency, the amplitude of vibration may be large 
enough to cause failure of the bridge.
Recall that the damping factor was defined in Equation 
12.4, as α = R/2L for the series circuit. Comparing this to 
the definition of Q as ω0L/R (Equation 14.31), it is seen 
that
	
Q = w
a
0
2
	
(14.41)
The smaller the R, the lesser is the damping, the smaller 
is the α, and the larger is the Q. For a critically damped 
circuit, α = ω0 so that Q = 0.5. Q < 0.5 for an overdamped 
circuit and Q > 0.5 for an underdamped circuit.
Example 14.2 illustrates a bandpass response of a 
­second-order circuit involving two capacitors. It exem-
plifies some important concepts that are discussed after 
the example.

where ω0 = 1/CR. Equation 14.43 is of exactly the same 
form as Equation 14.33, but with a multiplying factor of 
1/3. This scalar multiplier does not affect the type of fre-
quency response, which is therefore bandpass. At ω = ω0, 
HBP(jω) has its maximum value of 1/3. Comparing the 
denominators of Equations 14.33 and 14.43, it follows 
that Q = 1/3.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 14.19, 
assuming C = 1 μF and R = 1000/2π = 159.155 Ω, so 
that ω0 = 1/RC = 2π/(103 × 10−6) = 2π × 103 rad/s ≡ 
1 kHz. The details of the simulation are as previ-
ously explained in Example 14.1. Simulation Settings 
include a start frequency of 10 Hz, an end frequency 
of 100 kHz, and 1000 points/decade. After the simula-
tion is run, select DB(V(R2:1)). |HBP(jω)| is displayed 
as in Figure 14.20. The maximum value at ω0 = 1 kHz is 
20log10(1/3) = −9.54 dB.
The low-frequency asymptote, as ω → 0, is |HBP(jω)| = 
(1/3)3ω/ω0 = ω/ω0, and the high-frequency asymptote, 
as ω → ∞, is |HBP(jω)| = (1/3)3ω0/ω = ω0/ω. The two 
asymptotes intersect at ω = ω0, at the 0 dB line.
To display the low-frequency asymptote, select 
Trace/Add Trace and enter 20*LOG10(Frequency)-
20*LOG10(1000) in the Trace expression field. To 
display the high-frequency asymptote, the entry is 
−20*LOG10(Frequency) + 20*LOG10(1000).

With  the cursor at ω0, enter the search command 
sle(max-3). Cursor 1 moves to ωc2 and its value is dis-
played in the Cursor Window as 3.2963K. Repeat the 
same command but with Cursor 2 selected in the Search 
Command window. Cursor 2 moves to ωc1 and its value 
is displayed in the Cursor Window as 303.374. The dif-
ference Y1-Y2 is displayed as 2.9929K. This gives a Q of 
ω0/BW = 1/2.9929, which is nominally 1/3.
The Bode phase plot (Figure 14.21) is obtained by 
selecting Trace/add Trace and then P() from the right 
window and V(R1:1) from the left window.
It will be noted that the first RC circuit whose output 
is V1(jω) in Figure 14.18 is a first-order low-pass filter, 
whereas the second RC circuit whose output is VO(jω) 
is a first-order high-pass filter, with both filters having 
the same values of R and C. The two filters are cascaded 
by having the output of the low-pass filter applied as 
the input to the high-pass filter so that the transfer func-
tions V1(jω)/VSRC(jω) and VO(jω)/V1(jω) are multiplied 
by one another in order to derive the overall response 
(Equation 14.42). As explained in connection with Figure 
14.3c, multiplication of a low-pass response and a high-
pass response results in a bandpass response. Note that 
multiplication of the magnitudes of transfer functions is 
equivalent to adding them on the Bode magnitude plots.
A relevant question is, how would Q change if the two 
cascaded first-order filters are isolated from one another? 
In Figure 14.18, the high-pass filter ‘loads’ the low-pass 
filter, that is, it draws its input current from the output 
of the low-pass filter, thereby affecting the output volt-
age V1(jω). The two filters can be isolated by inserting 
a unity-gain amplifier between the two filters, as dis-
cussed in Section 13.3 and illustrated in Figure 14.22.
It follows from Equation 14.2 that V1(jω)/VSRC(jω) = 
1/(1 + jωCR), and it follows from Equation 14.4 that 
VO(jω)/V1(jω) = jωCR/(1 + jωCR). The overall transfer

where ω0 = 1/CR. It is seen that Q is increased by isola-
tion from 1/3 to 1/2. This result is quite general and can 
be expressed as the following concept:
Concept: Second-order circuits having two capacitors or two 
inductors cannot have a Q exceeding 0.5.
Having Q = 0.5 means that the circuit is critically 
damped, as explained in connection with Equation 
14.41. Hence, second-order circuits having two capaci-
tors or two inductors are either overdamped or, at best, 
critically damped. They cannot be underdamped. In 
other words, underdamped, second-order, passive circuits of 
Q > 0.5 must have a capacitor and an inductor.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
14.6  Second-Order Bandstop Response
It was pointed out in Section 14.2 that the second-order 
bandpass and bandstop responses are complementary 
with respect to the applied input. This implies that if 
the voltage response across R is bandpass, the voltage 
response, which when added to the bandpass response 
equals the source voltage, must be bandstop. In other 
words, the response VLC(jω) across L and C together, as 
illustrated in Figure 14.23, must be bandstop.
That this is the case can be ascertained qualitatively 
before analyzing the circuit, as was done with the cir-
cuits considered so far. At ω = 0, the capacitor acts as 
an open circuit, I(jω) = 0, and VSRC(jω) appears across 
the capacitor so that VLC(jω) = VSRC(jω). As ω → ∞, the 
inductor acts as an open circuit, I(jω) = 0, and VSRC(jω) 
appears across the inductor so that, again, VLC(jω) = 
VSRC(jω). At the resonant frequency ω0, the series combi-
nation of L and C acts as a short circuit, VLC(jω) = 0, and 
I(jω) = VSRC(jω)/R. The nature of the response is there-
fore bandstop.
Analytically, VLC(jω) = VL(jω) + VC(jω), where, from

It is seen that the response is zero when 1 − ω2LC = 0, 
at the resonant frequency ω0. The denominator is

The amplitude and phase plots are shown in Figure 
14.24a and b for Q of 5 and 10. |HBS(jω)| is plotted 
and not its logarithm, because |HBS(jω)| = 0 at ω = 
ω0, and log100 → −∞. For ω < ω0, the net reactance 
is capacitive and can be represented as 1/ωCeff = 
(1/ωC − ωL). The circuit is equivalent to R in series 
with Ceff, and the response is akin to that of a low-
pass RC filter. When ω is only slightly larger than 
zero, 1/ωCeff is large and VLC(jω)  ≅ VSRC(jω) so that 
the magnitude of the response is near unity and the 
phase angle is small. When ω is slightly less than ω0, 
1/ωCeff is small, like 1/ωC of a low-pass RC filter as 
ω → ∞. The response is small and the phase angle is 
near −90° (Figure 14.24).
For ω > ω0, the net reactance is inductive and can be 
represented as ωLeff = (ωL − 1/ωC). The circuit is equiva-
lent to R in series with Leff, and the response is akin to 
that of a high-pass RL filter. When ω is slightly larger 
than ω0, ωLeff is small, like ωL of the RL filter for ω ≅ 0. 
The response is small and the phase angle is near +90°. 
As ω → ∞, ωLeff is large, the magnitude of the response is 
near unity, and the phase angle is small, like that of the 
high-pass RL filter.

as for the bandpass response.

14.7  Second-Order Low-Pass 
and High-Pass Responses
14.7.1  Low-Pass Response
Suppose that the response is taken across the capacitor 
in the series RLC circuit, as shown in Figure 14.26. At 
ω = 0, the capacitor acts as an open circuit and the induc-
tor as a short circuit, I(jω) = 0, and VC(jω) = VSRC(jω). 
As ω → ∞, the inductor acts as an open circuit and the 
capacitor as a short circuit and VC(jω) = 0. The response 
is clearly of a low-pass nature. It is generally true that 
when the response of a filter is taken across a capacitor, 
the response tends to zero as ω → ∞ so that the response 
is of a low-pass nature.
However, at the resonant frequency, the net reac-
tance is zero, and if R is small enough, the current at 
this frequency will be large. Thus, as R → 0, I(jω0) → ∞. 
When this large current is multiplied by the imped-
ance of the capacitor, VC(jω) can exceed VSRC(jω). In 
other words, the second-order low-pass response can 
exhibit some peaking, unlike the first-order low-pass 
response.

, can be positive or negative. This means 
that +tan−1 (imaginary part/real part) is an angle in 
the first quadrant when ω is small, and  moves counter 
clockwise to the second quadrant as ω → ∞. Its negation, 
∠HLP(jω), is in fourth or third quadrants, respectively.
We wish to determine if |HLP(jω)| has a maximum at 
some frequency, which means that the expression under 
the square root in Equation 14.52 has a minimum. To 
check this, it is convenient to denote ω/ω0 by u so that 
the expression becomes

If R = 0, Q → ∞, and |HLP(jω)|max → ∞ at ω = ωmax, 
confirming that |HLP(jω)| has a maximum at this fre-
quency. For R small but not zero, the response is highly 
peaked, as was argued qualitatively. Moreover, since 
the impedance of the capacitor is inversely propor-
tional to frequency, maximum VC(jω) = I(jω)/jωC occurs 
not when I(jω) is maximum, that is, at ω = ω0, but at a 
slightly lower frequency, as given by Equation 14.55. It 
may be noted that in Equation 14.56, |HLP(jω)|max → ∞ 
when Q2 = 1/4 or Q = 0.5. But ωmax is an imaginary fre-
quency for Q < 1
2

 (Equation 14.55), so no peaking in 
fact occurs for Q £ 1

.
It is of interest to determine the equations of the 
asymptotes of |HLP(jω)|. As ω → 0, |HLP(jω)| → 1 
(Equation 14.52), and 20log10|HLP(jω)| → 0 dB. The low-
frequency asymptote is therefore the 0 dB line, that is, 
the horizontal axis. As ω → ∞, the u4 term in the denomi-
nator of Equation 14.52 dominates so that |HLP(jω)| → 
(ω0/ω)2. Taking the logarithm to base 10 and multiplying 
by 20, the equation of the high-frequency asymptote is

It is seen that the high-frequency asymptote has a slope 
of −40 dB/decade. When ω = ω0, the RHS of Equation 14.57 
is zero, which means that asymptote intersects the 0 dB 
line at ω = ω0. A larger magnitude of the slope at high 
frequencies means that these unwanted frequencies 
attenuate more rapidly. This is desirable and closer to 
the ideal low-pass characteristic of Figure 14.2a.
The Bode magnitude and phase plots are discussed in 
more detail in Example 14.3.

Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 14.27. To 
display multiple traces for different resistance values, 
double-click on the default resistance value displayed, 
which invokes the Display Properties window. In the 
Value field, enter a chosen designation enclosed in curly 
brackets, which tells PSpice that this is a parameter 
and not a fixed value. In the present example, {R_val} 
is entered. The next step is to declare {R_val} a global 
parameter. Place the part PARAM from the SPECIAL 
library; this shows on the schematic as PARAMETERS:. 
When this word is double-clicked, the Property Editor 
spreadsheet is displayed. Click on the New Column 
button to display the Add New Column dialog box. 
Enter R_val in the Name field and any value, say, 1k, 
in the Value field. A new column R_val is added to the 
spreadsheet with the entry 1k. To have this displayed on 
the schematic, click on the Display button and choose 
Name and Value in the Display Properties dialog box. 
R_val = 1k appears under PARAMETERS:, as shown in 
Figure 14.27.

After the simulation is run, the magnitude plot for the 
four resistance values is displayed, as in Figure 14.28a. 
The high-frequency asymptote is added by selecting 
Trace/Add traces, then entering in the Trace Expression 
field 40*LOG10[63.662] − 40*LOG10[Frequency], where 
f0 = (400/2π) = 63.662 Hz. Other details of the simulation 
are as in Example 14.2.
The cursor can be used to obtain quantitative infor-
mation. To select a particular trace, such as that for Q = 
20, for example, click on its colored marker just below 
the horizontal axis on the LHS. Press the Toggle cur-
sor button and then the Cursor Max button. The cursor 
reads the max as 26.021 dB at 63.631 Hz. The calculated 
values from Equations 14.58 and 14.57 are 26.023 dB at 
63.662 Hz.
The trace for Q = 1

 is of special interest as it 
­represents a maximally flat or Butterworth response 
(Section  15.2). For larger values of Q, the response 
is peaked. The trace having Q = 0.5 represents criti-
cal damping. Note that the corner frequency, where 
the two asymptotes intersect, is at f = f0. However, 
this is the 3  dB cutoff frequency only for the plot 
having Q = 1

. The 3 dB cutoff 
frequency for all other plots is not at f = f0. This illus-
trates that, in general, the 3 dB cutoff frequency is dif-
ferent from the corner frequency.
To obtain the phase plot, select Trace/Add Traces, 
then choose P( ) and enter V(C1:1). The phase plot is dis-
played as in Figure 14.28b.
It is instructive to interpret the phase response. 
For 0 < ω < ω0, the net series reactance is capacitive. 
For small ω/ω0, this reactance is large, VC(jω) ≅ VSRC(jω), 
so ∠HLP(jω) is small and negative, in accordance with 
Equation 14.53, and as for a low-pass RC filter at ω ≅ 0. 
For ω/ω0 slightly less than 1, the net capacitive reac-
tance is small, I(jω) is nearly in phase with VSRC(jω), and 
VC(jω) lags I(jω) by almost 90°. ∠HLP(jω) ≅ −90°, like 
that of a low-pass RC filter as ω → ∞. From Equation 
14.53 the argument of the arctan function is large and 
positive, so the angle is near 90° and its negation is near 
−90°. For ω > ω0, the net series reactance is inductive. For 
ω/ω0 slightly larger than 1, the net inductive reactance 
is small, I(jω) lags VSRC(jω) by a small angle, and VC(jω) 
lags I(jω) by 90°. ∠HLP(jω) is slightly more negative than 
−90°. In Equation 14.53 the real part in the denominator 
is negative, and the argument of the arctan function is 
large and negative, so the angle is slightly more 90°, in 
the second quadrant, and its negation is slightly more 
negative than −90°, in the third quadrant. As ω → ∞, 
the net inductive reactance is large, I(jω) lags VSRC(jω) 
by almost 90° and VC(jω) lags I(jω) by another 90°, so 
∠HLP(jω) approaches −180° from the third quadrant.

the capacitor acts as a short circuit and the inductor as 
an open circuit and VC(jω) = VSRC(jω). The response is 
clearly of a high-pass nature. It is generally true that 
when the response of a filter is taken across an inductor, 
the response tends to zero as ω → 0 so that the response 
is of a high-pass nature.
At the resonant frequency, the net reactance is zero, 
and if R is small enough, the current at this frequency 
will be large. Thus, as R → 0, I(jω0) → ∞. When this large 
current is multiplied by the impedance of the inductor, 
VL(jω) can exceed VSRC(jω). In other words, the second-
order high-pass response can exhibit some peaking, 
unlike the first-order high-pass response.

Comparing Equations 14.59 and 14.51, it is seen that 
the high-pass and low-pass responses can be derived, 
one from the other, by interchanging jω and ω0, as was 
noted in connection with first-order responses.

­second or first quadrants, respectively.

Equation 14.62 is of exactly the same form as Equation 
14.54 with r = ω0/ω replacing u = ω/ω0. The same con-
clusions reached for the low-pass response apply to the 
high-pass response, but with ω/ω0 replaced by ω0/ω. 
Thus, by analogy to Equation 14.55, |HHP(jω)| has a

The interpretation is that maximum I(jω) occurs 
at ω  =  ω0, when the net reactance is zero. However, 
VL(jω) = jωLI(jω) so that maximum VL(jω) occurs at 
a frequency slightly higher than ω0, as indicated by 
Equation 14.63. The value of |HHP(jω)|max is the same 
as that of |HLP(jω)|max given by Equation 14.56. This is 
to be expected, for if |HHP(jω)| is the same function of 
ω0/ω as |HLP(jω)| is a function of ω/ω0, the high-pass 
and low-pass Bode magnitude plots for the same circuit 
are symmetrical with respect to the line ω = ω0. Thus, at 
a frequency ω = kω0, where k is a constant, ω/ω0 = k and

 (Equation 14.52). At a fre-
quency  ω0/ω = k, |HHP(jω)| will have the same value 
(Equation 14.60). On a log scale, the frequencies kω0 and 
ω0/k are equidistant on either side of ω0 so that the two 
plots are symmetrical with respect to the line ω = ω0.
It can be readily shown, as was done for the low-pass 
response, that the low-frequency asymptote has a slope of 
+40 dB/decade and the high-frequency asymptote coin-
cides with the horizontal axis. The Bode magnitude and 
phase plots are discussed in more detail in Example 14.4.
Example 14.4:  Bode Plots of Second-Order 
High-Pass Response
It is required to obtain the Bode magnitude and phase 
plots of the high-pass response of the series RLC cir-
cuit assuming the same values of R, L, and C as in 
Example 14.3 (Figure 14.30).
Solution:
The values of ω0 and Q are the same as in Example 14.3.

Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 14.30; the 
simulation procedure is the same as in Example 14.3, 
but with the voltage across the inductor V(L1:1) selected 
for plotting.
After the simulation is run, the magnitude plot for the 
four resistance values is displayed, as in Figure 14.31a. The 
high-frequency asymptote is added by selecting Trace/
Add traces and then entering in the Trace Expression 
field −40*LOG10[63.662]+ 40 * LOG10[Frequency], where 
f0 = (400/2π) = 63.662 Hz. Note the symmetry with respect 
to the line through f0 between the low-pass response of 
Figure 14.28a and the high-pass response of Figure 14.31a.
It is instructive to interpret the phase response. For 
0 < ω < ω0, the net series reactance is capacitive. For small 
ω, this reactance is large, I(jω) leads VSRC(jω) by slightly 
less than 90° and VL(jω) leads I(jω) by 90°, so ∠HLP(jω) is 
slightly less than 180°. In Equation 14.53, ω0/ω is large, the 
imaginary part and the real part are negative. Their ratio 
is proportional to ω/ω0 and is small. The angle given by 
the arctan function is in the third quadrant, slightly more 
than 180°. Its negation is in the second quadrant, slightly 
less than 180°. For ω slightly less than ω0, the net capaci-
tive reactance is small, I(jω) leads VSRC(jω) by a small angle 
and VL(jω) leads I(jω) by 90°, so ∠HLP(jω) is slightly more 
than 90°. In Equation 14.53, ω0/ω is slightly larger than 1. 
The imaginary part and the real part are still negative but 
their ratio is positive and large. The angle is in the third 
quadrant, slightly less than 270°. Its negation is in the sec-
ond quadrant, slightly more than 90°. For ω > ω0, the net 
series reactance is inductive. For ω slightly larger than ω0, 
the net inductive reactance is small, I(jω) lags VSRC(jω) by 
a small angle and VL(jω) leads I(jω) by 90°, so ∠HLP(jω) is 
slightly less than 90°. In Equation 14.53, ω0/ω is slightly 
less than 1. The imaginary part is negative and the real 
part is positive. Their ratio is negative and large. The 
angle is in the fourth quadrant, slightly larger than 270°. 
Its negation is in the first quadrant, slightly less than 90°. 
As ω → ∞, the net inductive reactance is large, VL(jω) ≅ 
VSRC(jω), so ∠HLP(jω) approaches 0° in the first quadrant.

14.8  Parallel Circuit
The parallel GCL circuit excited by a current source 
(Figure 14.35) is the dual of the series RLC circuit of 
Figure 14.15, the dual quantities being the same as in 
Table 12.3. This table is reproduced as Table 14.1 in 
terms of the phasor variables, Q, ω0, and BW.
ω0 is clearly the same in both cases, since duality inter-
changes L and C, which leaves their product unaltered. 
Q for the series circuit is given by Equation 14.31 as 
Q = ω0L/R = 1/ω0CR. Replacing quantities by their duals,

Note that the dual of Gp is R in the series case, both 
having the same numerical values. But Rp is the recipro-
cal of Gp. It is also helpful to remember that the expres-
sions for Qp in Equation 14.65 are reciprocal in form to 
the expressions for Q in Equation 14.31. Thus, ω0CpRp is 
reciprocal in form to 1/ω0CR, and Rp/ω0Lp is reciprocal 
in form to ω0L/R. Note that for a parallel resonant cir-
cuit, the larger Rp, the larger is Qp.
It should be noted that Q, whether for a series or a par-
allel circuit, is determined only by circuit parameters, 
irrespective of any independent sources that may be 
present and their connections. Hence, the circuit config-
uration, whether series or parallel, can be ascertained, 
and the correct expression and value of Q derived, by 
setting independent sources to zero. This is the same as 
applied in Section 12.4, for ascertaining the circuit con-
figuration and determining α.
With ω0 the same, it is seen that ωc1, ωc2, and BW 
are given by the same expressions as Equations 14.39 
and 14.40, but with Q replaced by Qp:

The frequency responses follow readily from duality. 
These are listed in Table 14.2 for the series RLC circuit, as 
has previously been derived, together with the dual GCL 
counterpart. It is seen that the only difference in the dual 
responses when expressed in this form is the replace-
ment of Q of the series circuit by Qp of the parallel circuit.
The responses of the parallel circuit can be readily 
argued qualitatively. Consider, for example, the response 
IGp(jω)/ISRC(jω) and its complement with respect to the 
source, ILpCp(jω)/ISRC(jω) = (ILp(jω) + ICp(jω))/ISRC(jω). The 
key to understanding the behavior of the circuit is to 
recognize that at the resonant frequency ω0, the suscep-
tances of the inductor and capacitor are equal in magni-
tude but opposite in sign so that their sum is zero, that 
is, ω0C − 1/ω0L = 0. In other words, the impedance at 
resonance of Lp in parallel with Cp is infinite; that is, the 
parallel combinations act as an open circuit. This fol-
lows also for the parallel impedance at resonance as

This is in contrast to the series connection of L and C, 
where the impedance at resonance is zero, so that the 
series combination acts as a short circuit.
If the parallel combination of Lp and Cp acts as an open 
circuit at resonance, then the whole of the source current 
flows through Gp so that the combined current through the 
inductor and capacitor is ILpCp(jω0) = ILp(jω0) + ICp(jω0) = 0, 
and IGp(jω0) = ISRC(jω0). At ω = 0 the capacitor acts as an 
open circuit and the inductor as a short circuit. All of 
ISRC(jω) is diverted through Lp so that ILpCp(jω) = ISRC(jω), 
and IGp(jω0) = 0. If ω → ∞, the inductor acts as an open cir-
cuit and the capacitor as a short circuit. All of the ISRC(jω) 
is diverted through Cp so that, again, ILpCp(jω) = ISRC(jω), 
and IGp(jω0) = 0. It is seen that the response IGp(jω)/ISRC(jω) 
is bandpass, whereas the response ILpCp(jω)/ISRC(jω) is 
bandstop, as expected from duality. Similarly, it follows 
that the response ICp(jω)/ISRC(jω) is high pass, whereas 
the response ILp(jω)/ISRC(jω) is low pass.
It may be noted that the circuit of Figure 14.35 is of spe-
cial interest because it is the small-signal representation 
of a parallel-tuned circuit driven by a transistor amplifier. 
Examples 14.5 and 14.6 consider parallel GCL circuits. 
Example 14.6 illustrates that in determining the circuit 
configuration, whether series or parallel, independent 
sources are set to zero, as was done in Section 12.4. The 
same argument applies, namely, when voltages and cur-
rents in a circuit change, for any reason, including a varia-
tion in frequency; ideal, independent voltage sources act 
as short circuits; and ideal, independent current sources 
act as open circuits, as far as changes are concerned.
Primal Exercise 14.20
Consider the parallel GCL circuit that is the dual of the 
series circuit of Primal Exercise 14.15. Determine (a) Lp, 
Cp, Gp, Rp, (b) ω0, (c) Qp, and (d) BW; (e) compare ω0, Qp, 
and BW with those of the dual series circuit.
Ans. (a) Lp = 4 nH, Cp = 0.1 F, Gp = 1 kS, Rp =1 mΩ; 
(b) 50 krad/s; (c) 5; (d) 10 krad/s; (e) the same as those 
of the dual series circuit.
Exercise 14.21
It was demonstrated earlier that the impedance of a 
series combination of L and C is zero at resonance, 
whereas the admittance of a parallel combination of 
L and C is zero at resonance. Express this behavior in 
terms of duality.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Primal Exercise 14.22
Determine Q of the response VO(jω)/ISRC(jω) in Figure 14.36
Ans. 10.
Example 14.5:  Parallel GCL Circuit
A parallel GCL circuit excited by a current source is 
given, as in Figure 14.35. If a current input of 10 mA 
peak is to produce a maximum response of 1 V peak 
at 100 krad/s, it is required to determine Lp and Rp to 
give a BW of 2 krad/s and to derive ωc1 and ωc2. This 
example also illustrates using MATLAB to derive 
Bode plots.
Solution:
At resonance, the 10 mA current source sees only Rp, 
since Lp and Cp in parallel act as an open circuit. Hence, 
to produce a 1 V response at resonance, 1 V = Rp × 1 mA, 
which gives Rp =

(ωc1 + ωc2)/2, because of the relatively large Qp.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 14.37, 
using the source IAC. The resistor and capacitor are 
entered from the ANALOG_P library. To run the simula-
tion, select AC Sweep/Noise for the Analysis type in the 
Simulation Settings dialog box. Under AC Sweep Type 
select ‘Logarithmic’ and enter 100 for ‘Start Frequency’, 
1meg for ‘End Frequency’, and 3000 for ‘Points/Decade’. 
After the simulation is run, select in the SCHEMATIC1 
page Trace/Add Trace and then DB() from the right 
window and V(R1:1) from the left ­window. The plot 
appears as in Figure 14.38a.
Note that this is a plot of Vp(jω) in response to the 
10 mA source and is not a plot of the transfer function 
Vp(jω)/ISRC(jω), which is obtained with IAC = 1 A. The 
analytical expression for Vp(jω) is

ω →  0, is |Vp(jω)| = ω/50ω0, and the high-frequency 
asymptote, as ω → ∞, is |Vp(jω)| = ω0/50ω. The two 
asymptotes intersect, where ω/50ω0 = ω0/50ω, which 
occurs at ω = ω0.

To display the low-frequency asymptote, select Trace/
Add Trace and enter −20*LOG10(15915.5) − 20*LOG10​
(50) + 20*LOG10(Frequency) in the Trace expression field, 
where f0 = 15915.5 Hz. To display the high-­frequency 
asymptote, the entry is 20*LOG10(15915.5) − 20*LOG10​
(50 − 20*LOG10​(frequency). The two asymptotes inter-
sect at f = f0, as explained earlier.
f0, fc1, and fc2 can be read using the cursor. Click first 
on the Toggle cursor icon and then on the Cursor Max 
icon. f0 is read in the Cursor Window as 15.922 K, com-
pared to 105/(2π) = 15.916 kHz. With the cursor at f0, 
enter the search command sle(max-3). Cursor 1 moves 
to fc2 and its value is displayed in the Cursor Window 
as 16.075 K, corresponding to 100.002 krad/s. Repeat 
the same command, but with Cursor 2 selected in the 
Search Command window. Cursor 2 moves to fc1 and its 
value is displayed in the Cursor Window as 15.757 K, 
corresponding to 99.004 krad/s. The difference Y2-Y1 
is displayed as 318.000, corresponding to 1.998 krad/s. 
Alternatively, select Trace/Evaluate Measurement and 
then Bandwidth_Bandpass_3dB(1), and enter V(R1:1) 
in place of ‘1’. In the Measurement Results window, 
318.11378 is displayed. The value of Q can be displayed 
by selecting Q_Bandpass(1,db_level) and entering 
V(R1:1) in place of ‘1’ and 3 in place of db_level. The 
value of 50.00340 is displayed in the Measurement 
Results window.
The Bode phase plot can be derived by selecting 
Trace/add Trace and then P() from the right window 
and V(R1:1) from the left window. The plot appears as 
in Figure 14.38b.
Bode plots from MATLAB: The coefficients of s = jω in 
the numerator and denominator of the transfer func-
tion are first entered as arrays in the order of decreasing 
powers of s, including the zero power for any constant 
term. The numerator in this case is 2 × 103s rad/s, so the 
coefficients are entered as
>>num = [2*10^3, 0]
The denominator is s2 + 2 × 103s + 1010, so the coef-
ficients are entered as
>>den = [1, 2*10^3, 10^10]
The bode command is entered as
>>bode(num, den)
The Bode magnitude and phase plots are displayed as 
in Figure 14.39, after some editing for clarity.
Example 14.6:  Bandstop Response
	 (a)	 It is required to verify that the response VR(jω) of 
the circuit of Figure 14.40 is bandstop and that the 
response VLC(jω) is bandpass.
	 (b)	 If R = 1 kW, determine L and C so that the half-
power frequencies are 1000 and 1200 rad/s.
Solution:
	 (a)	 At the resonant frequency, L in parallel with C acts 
as an open circuit so that the current through R is 
zero, VR(jω) = 0, and VLC(jω) = VSRC(jω). At ω = 0, the 
inductor acts as a short circuit so that VLC(jω) = 0 and 
VR(jω) = VSRC(jω). Similarly, as ω → ∞, the capacitor 
acts as a short, and again VLC(jω) = 0 and VR(jω) = 
VSRC(jω). It follows that the response across R is 
bandstop, whereas the response across L and C 
is bandpass. The transfer function is

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Equation 14.70 is of exactly the same form 
as Equation 14.47, with Qp, replacing Q, where 
Qp = R/ω0L is Q of the parallel circuit, as given by 
Equation 14.65, with Rp replaced by R. This confirms 
that the circuit configuration can be ascertained by 
setting the voltage source to zero, in which case the 
circuit reduces to a parallel GCL circuit.

Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 14.41, 
as in previous examples in this chapter. To run the 
simulation, select AC Sweep/Noise for the Analysis 
type in the Simulation Settings dialog box. Under AC 
Sweep, 10 is entered for ‘Start Frequency’, 1k for ‘End 
Frequency’, and 3000 for ‘Points/Decade’. After the 
simulation is run, select in the SCHEMATIC1 page 
Trace/Add Trace and then DB() from the right window 
and V(R1:1) from the left window. The x-axis range 
is set from 30 Hz to 1 kHz using Plot/Axis Settings. 
The plot appears as in Figure 14.42. Cursor minimum 
gives f0 = 174.350. Cursor command ‘sle(0.70711)’ 
gives fc2  = 190.984. Repeating this command, but 
selecting ­cursor 2, gives fc1 = 159.153. The  calcu-
lated values of f0, fc2, and fc1 are 174.346, 190.986, and 
159.155 Hz, respectively.
Primal Exercise 14.23
Determine the type of response VO(jω)/ISRC(jω), its max-
imum magnitude, and Q in Figure 14.43.
Ans. Response is bandpass, maximum response is 10 Ω; 
Q = 10.
14.9  Summary of Second-Order Responses
Prototypical, second-order responses are summarized 
in Table 14.3, normalized to a maximum response 
­magnitude of 1 and with jω replaced by s.
Although s, strictly speaking, is the complex fre-
quency of the Laplace transform (Chapter 20), it can, 
in fact, be replaced by jω for the sinusoidal steady state 
(Section 22.3), as is the case with frequency responses. 
Substituting s = jω gives the same responses as in 
Table 14.2 multiplied by w0
2, with s2
0
2
= -w .
The following should be noted concerning Table 14.3:
	
1.	By definition, the prototypical responses in 
terms of s have a unity coefficient of the term 
representing the highest power of s in the 
denominator, which is s2 in the case of second-
order responses, as well as in the numerator, 
when s2 occurs.
	
2.	The frequency responses can, in general, be 
multiplied by a scalar K, without changing the 
nature of the response.
	
3.	When the responses are normalized to a maxi-
mum response magnitude of 1, the numerator of 
the low-pass response must be w0
2, the constant 
term in the denominator, so that the response is 
1 when ω = 0 or s = 0. Similarly, the numerator 
of the high-pass response must be s2 so that the 
response is 1 when ω → ∞ or s → ∞. The numer-
ator of the bandpass response must be (ω0/Q)s 
so that the response is 1 when s2
0
2
= -w .

4.	Each term in the numerator and denominator 
has the units of (rad/s)2 so that the transfer 
function is dimensionless in term of ratios of 
voltages or currents.
	
5.	The denominator is the same in all the responses. 
This is a consequence of the denominator being 
an expression of the characteristic equation of 
the differential equation (Equation 12.6) and the 
fact that the homogeneous differential equa-
tion is of the same form for all responses in the 
circuit.
	
6.	The coefficient ω0/Q of s in the denomina-
tor is the 3 dB BW of bandpass and bandstop 
responses. Q in the low-pass and high-pass 
responses is defined as in Table 14.1 for series 
and parallel circuits.
	
7.	Being independent of the excitation, Q can, in 
all cases, be determined by setting independent 
sources to zero.
	
8.	Whereas the maximum change in the phase 
angle is 90° in first-order responses, it is 180° 
in second-order responses, except the all-pass 
response. In all the types of fist-order and 
­second-order circuits discussed in this chapter, 
the phase angle becomes more lagging as the 
frequency increases.
	
9.	The all-pass response has a magnitude of unity 
at all frequencies but produces a phase shift of 
360° as a function of frequency (Problem P14.38).
	 10.	The responses are interrelated. For example, 
the all-pass response is the bandpass response 
subtracted 
from 
the 
bandstop 
response 
(Problem P14.38). The bandstop response is the 
sum of the low-pass and high-pass responses.
	 11.	Interchanging s and ω0 changes a low-pass 
response to a high-pass response and con-
versely. This is equivalent to interchanging 
inductors and capacitors. For if we consider

chapter.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 The transfer function H(jω) in the frequency 
domain is the ratio of the phasor of the des-
ignated output to the phasor of a single input 
applied to the filter:
	
1.	 As a ratio of two phasors, H(jω) has a mag-
nitude and phase angle, both of which are, 
in general, functions of frequency.
	
2.	 H(jω) is derived under steady-state sinusoi-
dal conditions, with independent sources 
present only at the input of the filter.
•	 There are four basic frequency responses: 
low pass, high pass, bandpass, and bandstop. 
The range of frequencies over which there 
is little or no attenuation between input and 
output is the passband, whereas the range of 
frequencies over which there is considerable 
­attenuation between input and output is the 
stopband.
•	 The basic frequency responses are interrelated 
in the sense that some responses can be derived 
from other responses through addition, sub-
traction, and multiplication or by complement-
ing the normalized response with respect to 
unity.
•	 The frequency response of a first-order filter is 
either low pass or high pass, the variation of the 
response with frequency being due to the fre-
quency-dependent reactance of energy storage 
elements.
•	 In logarithmic plots,
	
1.	 The plot of y
axn
=
 is a straight line of slope n; 
a shifts the line vertically, without affecting 
its slope.
	
2.	 Equal spacing along a logarithmic axis is 
equivalent to equal ratios of the variable 
involved.
•	 In Bode magnitude plots, the horizontal axis is 
labeled in terms of ω but scaled logarithmically 
as log10ω. The vertical axis is labeled and scaled 
linearly as 20log10|H(jω)| dB, which is the dB 
value of |H(jω)|. In Bode phase plots, the hori-
zontal axis is the same as in the Bode magnitude 
plots, whereas the vertical axis is the phase shift 
in degrees.
•	 A characteristic feature of Bode plots is that 
they can be approximated over some frequency 
ranges by straight-line asymptotes. First-order, 
low-pass, and high-pass responses have a hor-
izontal-line asymptote over the passband. The 
asymptote in the stopband is a line of slope 
−20 dB/decade in the case of a low-pass filter 
and of slope +20 dB/decade in the case of a 
high-pass filter.
•	 The points of intersection of asymptotes of Bode 
plots are corner frequencies. In the case of first-
order filters, the corner frequency is also the 
3 dB cutoff frequency, at which the magnitude 
of the transfer function is 1
2
/
 of its limiting, 
maximum value in the passband. In all cases, 
the 3 dB cutoff frequency is synonymous with 
the half-power frequency, at which the power 
delivered to a resistive load at the output of the 
filter is one-half the maximum power delivered 
to the same load at the limiting maximum value 
in the passband.
•	 Second-order responses are more varied and 
can be low pass, high pass, bandpass, or band-
stop. The first three types of response show 
pronounced peaking or resonance when the 
damping is small.
•	 A second-order response can be obtained from 
two independent energy storage elements of 
the same type, that is, elements that cannot be 
combined into a single element. However, Q of 
these circuits does not exceed 0.5.
•	 In a series RLC circuit, the sum of the inductive 
and capacitive reactances is zero at the resonant 
frequency ω0 so that the series combination of 
L and C acts as a short circuit. In a parallel GCL 
circuit, the sum of the inductive and capacitive 
susceptances is zero at the resonant frequency 
ω0 so that the parallel combination of L and C 
acts as an open circuit.
•	 A bandpass response can result from cas-
cading a low-pass response and a high-pass 
response. A bandstop response can result from 
the summation of a low-pass and a high-pass 
response.
•	 The 3 dB BW of bandpass and bandstop circuits 
equals ω0/Q. The higher the Q, the narrower 
the BW for a given ω0, where Q depends on the 
power dissipated in the circuit, relative to the 
maximum energy store.
•	 w0

= / LC  for both series RLC circuits and par-
allel GCL circuits. In a series circuit, Q = ω0L/R = 
1/ω0CR. In a parallel circuit, Qp = ω0CpRp = 
Rp/ω0Lp.

and conversely.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Always determine how a filter circuit behaves at 
ω = 0, as ω → ∞, and at the resonant frequency 
in the case of second-order circuits.
	
2.	In determining the phase response, retain 
the signs of the imaginary and real parts, 
whose ratio is the tangent of the phase angle, 
so as to locate the phase angle in the correct 
quadrant.

Design Problems
P14.62	 A high-pass filter is to be used to reduce the drift, 
that is, the slow variation with time, of a biological 
signal applied to an electronic instrument having an 
input resistance of 1 MΩ and negligible input capaci-
tance. If a low-frequency signal of 0.25 Hz is not to be 
attenuated by more than 3 dB, determine the smallest 
capacitance that must be connected at the input of the 
instrument.
	
Ans. 0.64 μF.
P14.63	In high-quality sound reproduction, different loud-
speakers handle different ranges of audio frequencies. 
A woofer loudspeaker reproduces lower audio fre-
quencies, up to about 3 kHz, whereas a tweeter loud-
speaker reproduces audio frequencies in the range 
3 kHz to about 20 kHz. The output of the audio ampli-
fier is applied to the loudspeakers through a crossover 
circuit that directs the appropriate range of frequen-
cies to each loudspeaker. In its simplest form, this 
circuit consists of first-order low-pass and high-pass 
filters that feed the woofer and tweeter, respectively, 
as in Figure P14.63. The responses of the two filters 
cross at the crossover frequency fc, which is the −3 dB 
frequency of each filter. Determine L and C, assuming 
fc = 2.5 kHz and that each loudspeaker presents a pure 
resistance of 8 Ω.
	
Ans. Approximately 0.5 mH and 8 μF.
P14.64	 Determine L and C in Figure P14.64 so as to have a 
bandpass filter having a resonant frequency of 2 kHz 
and a BW of 500 Hz.

Frequency Responses

P14.65	A bandpass, series RLC circuit is required having 
ω0 = 106 rad/s, BW = 104 rad/s, L = 1 mH, and a maxi-
mum gain of 0.5. Implement the circuit using 5 Ω resis-
tors, 2 mH inductors, and 2 nF capacitors.
	
Ans. The circuit consists of a series combination of 
two 2 mH inductors in parallel, two 2 nF capacitors 
in series, and two 5 Ω resistors in series, across one of 
which the output is taken.
P14.66	 In touch-tone telephone dialing, the push buttons are 
arranged in four rows and three columns, with buttons 
in each row arranged to generate one of four frequen-
cies in a low-frequency group and buttons in each col-
umn arranged to generate one of three frequencies in 
a high-frequency group, as illustrated in Figure P14.66. 
In this way, each button is identified by one of seven 
combinations of a low frequency in the low-frequency 
group and a high frequency in the high-frequency 
group. Pressing the number 5 button, for example, 
generates tones of frequencies 770 and 1336 Hz. The 
frequencies for each button are discriminated from 
neighboring circuits by bandpass filters. In the case 
of the number 5 button, the center frequency of the 
low-frequency bandpass filter is 770 Hz, whereas its 
3 dB cutoff frequencies are 697 and 852 Hz, which are 
the center frequencies for the bandpass filters for the 
neighboring frequency on each side. Similarly, the cen-
ter frequency of the high-frequency bandpass filter is 
1336 Hz, whereas its 3 dB cutoff frequencies are 1209 
and 1477 Hz. Determine L and C for a series RLC ­circuit 
that discriminates the frequencies in the low-frequency 
group, considering the outermost frequencies of this 
group to be 3 dB cutoff frequencies, and assuming R in 
standard telephone circuits is 600 Ω.
	
Ans. L = 0.39 H, C = 0.1 μF.

Objective and Overview
Having considered the basic first-order and second-
order frequency responses in Chapter 14, the present 
chapter focuses on two types of filters that are of consid-
erable practical importance, namely, Butterworth and 
active filters.
Butterworth filters characteristically have a maximally 
flat response in the passband, which makes them par-
ticularly useful as low-pass and high-pass filters. Active 
filters, as their name implies, incorporate an active ele-
ment, usually in the form of an operational amplifier, 
previously discussed in Chapter 13. These filters are also 
commonly used, because the op amp provides many 
advantages, including the convenience of using only 
capacitors and resistors, with a Q that is not limited to 
0.5 or less, as is the case with passive RC circuits.
This chapter begins by explaining the procedure of 
scaling, which focuses on designing a particular type 
of filter in normalized form. The nature of Butterworth 
filters is then explained and examples are given of the 
design of such filters. First-order active filters are intro-
duced and their responses analyzed. Second-order 
active filters of various types, using a single op amp in 
the noninverting or inverting configuration, are then 
presented. The chapter ends with a discussion of a 
­second-order universal active filter that can implement 
any of the second-order responses.
15.1  Scaling
Scaling provides a convenient, generalized, and system-
atic procedure for implementing a given type of passive 
or active filter. The type of filter under consideration is 
first designed in a normalized form, based on a 3 dB cut-
off frequency ωc, or a center frequency ω0, of 1 rad/s, 
as well as any conditions imposed by the nature of the 
filter. Scaling is then applied to implement the filter in 
the form having the desired ωc or ω0 and any desired 
constraints, such as the value of a capacitance, induc-
tance, or resistance.
Consider, for example, a normalized second-
order bandpass filter having ω0  =  1  rad/s. To have 
ω0  =  1  rad/s, it is convenient to assume normalized 
values of L = 1 H and C = 1 F, since these values give 
w0
1
1
=
=
/
rad/s
LC
. The normalized value of R cannot 
also be 1, because this would constrain Q = ω0L/R for a 
series circuit, or Qp = ω0CR for a parallel circuit, to be 1. 
Hence, the value of R in the normalized filter depends 
on the desired Q. If Q = 10, for example, then R = 0.1 Ω 
for the series circuit. Based on these normalized val-
ues, scaling can be applied to derive a filter having any 
desired ω0, such as 100 krad/s, and any particular value 
of L, C, or R, such as L = 1 mH.
It is convenient to consider that scaling is applied 
in two steps: (1) multiplying the magnitudes of the 
impedances in the circuit by a magnitude scaling fac-
tor, without changing the frequency, and (2) multiply-
ing the frequency by a frequency scaling factor, without 
changing the magnitudes of the impedances. When 
both impedance magnitudes and frequency are to be 
changed, both scaling factors are applied.
In scaling impedance magnitudes, the object is to 
multiply these magnitudes by a positive, real scale fac-
tor km, which could be less than or greater than unity, 
without changing the frequency. To implement this, R 
is multiplied by km. L is also multiplied by km so that 
the impedance magnitude ωL is multiplied by km, with 
ω unchanged. C must be divided by km so that the 
impedance magnitude 1/ωC is multiplied by km, with ω 
unchanged. Thus,

where unprimed parameters denote the initial nor-
malized values and primed parameters having an m 
subscript denote the scaled values in accordance with 
impedance magnitude scaling.
Note that cutoff frequencies such as R/L or 1/CR, or 
center frequencies such as 1/ LC , are not affected by 
impedance magnitude scaling, since km cancels out from 
these expressions. This justifies considering scaling of 
impedance magnitudes independently of changing the 
frequency.
In frequency scaling, frequencies are changed without 
affecting magnitudes of impedances. Since resistance is 
not a function of frequency, it is not affected by frequency 
scaling. If the frequency is multiplied by a positive, real 
scale factor kf, without changing the magnitude of the 
impedance ωL, then L must be divided by kf. Similarly,

if the frequency is multiplied by kf, without changing the 
magnitude of the impedance 1/ωC, then C must also be 
divided by kf. If ω′ = kf ω is the scaled frequency, then in

Consider, for example, the normalized, series RLC, 
bandpass filter having ω0 = 1 rad/s, L = 1 H, C = 1 F, 
Q = 10, in which case R = ω0L/Q = 0.1 Ω, as explained 
previously. Suppose that a filter of this type is required to 
have ω0 = 100 krad/s and L = 1 mH. Applying frequency 
scaling to ω0 gives kf  =  (100  krad/s)/(1  rad/s)  =  105. 
To determine km when both impedance magnitude 
and frequency scaling are used, Equation 15.3 is 
applied to L and L′. Thus, km = kfL′/L = (105 × (1 mH)/
(1 H)  =  100. It follows from Equations 15.3 that 
R′ = 100 × (0.1 Ω) = 10 Ω and C′ = (1 F)/(105 × 100) = 0.1 μF. 
It is seen that w0

krad/s, and 
Q = ω0L/R = 105 × 10−3/10 = 10, or Q = 1/ω0CR = 1/
(105 × 10−7 × 10) = 10, as required.
Note that scaling applies to filters of any order and is 
not restricted to normalized filters but can be applied to 
any filter when it is desired to change a parameter value 
or frequency, as illustrated by Exercises 15.3 and 15.4.
Primal Exercise 15.1
Given a first-order, normalized RL filter having R = 1 Ω 
and L  =  1 H, determine the frequency and magni-
tude scaling factors to have a 3 dB cutoff frequency of 
10 krad/s and an inductance of 1 mH.
Ans. kf = 104, km = 10.
Primal Exercise 15.2
Scale the normalized second-order series RLC bandpass 
filter having L = 1 H, C = 1 F, and Q = 10 to have a band-
width of 5 krad/s, using a 50 nF capacitor.
Ans. L′ = 8 mH, R′ = 40 Ω.
Primal Exercise 15.3
Consider a series RLC filter having R = 40 Ω, L = 8 mH, 
and C = 50 nF, which makes ω0 = 50 kHz, Q = 10, and 
BW = 5 kHz. Suppose that the filter is to be modified to 
have R = 1 kΩ and ω0 = 100 kHz. Determine kf, km, the 
scaled values of L′ and C′ and verify that Q remains 
the same.
Ans. kf = 2, km = 25, L′ = 0.1 H, C′ = 1 nF.
Primal Exercise 15.4
Consider the filter of Primal Example 15.3 having R = 40 Ω, 
L = 8 mH, and C = 50 nF, which makes ω0 = 50 kHz, Q = 10, 
and BW = 5 kHz. Suppose that the filter is to be modified 
to have ω0 = 10 kHz, L = 20 mH, and Q = 5. Determine 
km, kf, the scaled values of R′ and C′ and verify that the 
required values are obtained. Note that the frequency 
should first be scaled, which keeps Q the same, and then 
R changed to change Q.
Ans. kf = 0.2, km = 0.5, C′ = 0.5 μF, R = 40 Ω.
15.2  Butterworth Response
The Butterworth response will be illustrated, to begin 
with, using the second-order low-pass response. Recall 
from Section 14.2 that an ideal low-pass filter has unity 
gain in the passband, zero gain in the stopband, with 
an infinitely sharp transition, or roll-off, between the 
two bands. The Bode magnitude plot is as illustrated 
in Figure 15.1a. Referring to Figure 14.28a, consider the 
Bode magnitude plots for Q = 1
2
/
 and Q = 0.5, repro-
duced in Figure 15.1b. The plot for Q = 1
2
/
 is maxi-
mally flat in the sense that, if Q > 1
2
/
, the plot rises to 
a maximum above the 0 dB line, which means that the 
response is not flat in the passband. On the other hand, 
if Q < 1
2
/
, the plot begins to fall below the 0  dB at 
smaller values of ω/ω0 than in the case of Q = 1
2
/
. This 
again means that the response is not as flat in the pass-
band as in the case of Q = 1
2
/
. We wish to investigate 
the reason for this behavior and hence deduce the form 
of maximally flat responses for filters of order greater 
than second order.

Table 15.1 lists several values of u in the passband, 
between 0 and 1, in 0.1 increments, and the corre-
sponding values of u2, 2u2, u4, y1, and y2. The key obser-
vation is that the increase in y1 with u, and hence the 
drop in |HLP(jω)| with ω, is dominated in the range 
0 ≤ u ≤ 1 by the term 2u2 and not by the term u4. This is 
because as a fraction, u4 is smaller than u2, particularly 
for small value of u. As a result, y2 increases less rap-
idly with u than y1, resulting in a flatter response in 
the passband for Q = 1

, compared to the response 
for Q = 0.5.

The same argument can be extended to a response of

Such a response has three important features:

. On the other 
hand, when n = 5, for example, (1 + u10) has 
the same value of 1.0081 if u = 0.618, or more 
than twice the frequency of 0.3. This means 
that the larger the n, the larger the frequency 
is in the passband at which the response is 
at a certain value less than unity. In other 
words, the larger n, the “flatter” the response is 
in the passband.
	
2.	The high-frequency asymptote, as u  →  ∞, is 
20log10|HLP2(jω)| = −20log10(un) = −20nlog10(u). 
That is, the slope is 20n dB/decade. As n 
increases, not only is the response flatter in the 
passband, but the transition between the passband 
and the stopband is also sharper. The response 
becomes closer to the ideal.

. That is, all the responses 
have an attenuation of −3 dB at u = 1, or ω = ω0, 
regardless of n. Hence, ω0 is the 3 dB cutoff fre-
quency or the half-power frequency for all  n. 
It is also the corner frequency, because the 
asymptote −20nlog10(u) is zero at u = 1. In other 
words, the high-frequency asymptote inter-
sects the 0 dB line at ω = ω0. Because of this, ω0 
can be replaced by ωc, the symbol for a cutoff 
frequency. The responses for n = 2 and n = 5 are 
shown in Figure 15.1c.
Higher-order responses of the form of Equation 15.11 
are indeed possible and are known as Butterworth 
responses. They are based on the Butterworth poly-
nomials given in Table 15.2 for orders up to eight. 
These  polynomials are in normalized form, corre-
sponding to a cutoff frequency of 1 rad/s. The poly-
nomials of order greater than two are expressed as 
products of second-order and first-order power func-
tions, which are appropriate for implementation as a 
cascade of first-order and second-order filters, as will 
be clarified shortly.
To show that these polynomials do give the required 
responses, consider, the first-order Butterworth polyno-
mial, B1(s). Substituting s = jω, B1(jω) = 1 + jω, and

In summary, the Butterworth polynomials embody 
the following concept:
Concept: In the expression for the magnitude of a Butterworth 
polynomial of order n, the only term in ω is a term raised to 
the power 2n.
How are these polynomials used in low-pass and high-
pass filters? To answer this question, we will consider 
first-order and second-order responses only, because, in 
practice, higher-order filters are implemented as a cas-
cade of such filters. For a first-order response (n = 1), 
the magnitude of the normalized, low-pass response is 
given by Equation 15.11, with ω0 = 1 and u = ω, as

which is the same as Equation 14.14, with ωcl = 1 rad/s. 
That is, an ordinary first-order response is in fact a 
Butterworth response of the first order.
For a second-order response (n  =  2), the magni-
tude of the normalized, low-pass response is given by 
Equation 15.11, with ω0 = 1 and u = ω, is

It follows from Table 15.2 that the normalized Butter­
worth polynomial of the second order is the denominator of 
the normalized Butterworth low-pass response.
As for a high-pass response, recall from Table 14.3, 
that the transformation from a low-pass to a high-pass 
filter involves replacing s/ω0 by ω0/s or replacing jω 
by 1/jω in the case of a normalized response having 
ω0 = 1 rad/s. Thus, Equation 15.18 becomes

function is the same as that of the prototypical high-pass 
response of Table 14.3, with ω0 = 1 rad/s and Q = 1

.
The preceding arguments can be generalized in the 
following concepts:
Concepts:
	
1.	In a normalized Butterworth, low-pass response of 
order n, the Butterworth polynomial of Table 15.2 
is the denominator of the transfer function, the 
numerator of the transfer function being unity.
	
2.	In a normalized Butterworth, high-pass response of 
order n, (a) the Butterworth polynomial of Table 15.2, 
with s replaced by 1/s, and the numerator of the ­transfer 
function being unity, is the denominator of the trans­
fer function, or (b) the Butterworth polynomial of Table 
15.2 is the denominator of the transfer function, the 
numerator of the transfer function being sn.
What about bandpass and bandstop filters? Bandpass 
filters having a flat, or nearly flat response, are very 
desirable in many applications. Such responses can be 
derived using a more complicated transformation than 

450	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
that between low-pass and high-pass responses. In 
practice, the required response is commonly obtained 
using magnetically coupled, second-order tuned circuits 
in cascaded amplifier stages, or by “stagger-tuning” 
­second-order tuned circuits in cascaded amplifier stages, 
that is, by having slightly different resonant frequencies 
of these circuits. Bandstop circuits normally have narrow-
band responses in order to reject a particular frequency, 
such as the 50  Hz power frequency, so that bandstop 
Butterworth responses are not normally required.
Although a high-order low-pass or high-pass Butter­
worth response can approach the ideal filter response, 
other types of filters are more efficient in achieving the 
same sharp transition between the passband and the stop-
band but with a lower-order filter, which means having 
fewer components in the circuit. However, this is achieved 
by allowing some “ripple,” or oscillation, in the magni-
tude of the response in the passband, as in Chebyshev 
filters, or in both the passband and the stopband, as in 
elliptic filters.

Example 15.1:  Second-Order and Third-Order 
Butterworth Low-Pass Filters
It is required to design a low-pass Butterworth filter 
having a cutoff frequency of 100 krad/s, using 50  nF 
capacitors and to implement the filter as (a) a second-
order filter and (b) a third-order filter, both filters having 
a maximum gain of unity in the passband. The transfer 
functions are to be derived and the filters implemented 
using series RLC circuits.

to 100 krad/s requires kf = 105. To scale C from 1 F to 
50  nF, with frequency scaling, requires km  =  (1  F)/
(kf × 50 nF) = 1/(105 × 50 × 10−9) = 200 (Equation 15.3).

and R¢ =

(15.25)
Note that whereas R′ of the required filter depends 
on km, and L′ depends on both km and kf, the transfer 
function of the required filter (Equation 15.25) depends 
only on kf. This is because the units of each term in the 
numerator and denominator of the voltage/voltage 
or current/current transfer function is (rad/s)2 (Table 
14.3), which implies that these terms are affected by 
frequency scaling only. This means that the required 
response of Equation 15.25 can be derived from the 
normalized response of Equation 15.20 by applying 
frequency scaling only. To do so, we note that the cut-
off frequency is 1 rad/s in the normalized response 
and 105  rad/s in the required response. Hence, to 
derive the transfer function of the required response 
from that of the normalized response, frequency in the 
normalized transfer function (Equation 15.20) should 
be divided by kf = 105 to give

of 100 krad/s. Hence, s must be divided by 105 to

1 rad/s, when substituting in Equation 15.20.
Multiplying the numerator and denominator 
of Equation 15.26 by 1010 gives the transfer func-
tion of Equation 15.25. To verify that km cancels out 
in the transfer function, we note that, when both

with Q unaffected by scaling.
	 (b)	 From Table 15.2, B3(s) = (s + 1)(s2 + s + 1), which 
is a cascade of a first-order circuit and a second-
order circuit. The normalized first-order circuit has 
ω0 = 1 rad/s, which means C = 1 F and R = 1 Ω. As 
in (a) kf = 105 and km = 200, so that C′ = 50 nF and 
R′ = 200 Ω, which gives ωcl = 100 krad/s. The cir-
cuit is shown in Figure 15.3.
For the second-order circuit, kf, km, and L′ are the 
same. However, the coefficient of s in the bracketed 
second-order term in B3(s) is unity, and not 2, as 
in B2(s). This means that ω0/Q = 1, or Q = 1, since 
ω0 = 1 rad/s in the normalized response. Hence, 
R = 1/ω0CQ = 1 Ω, so that R′ = 200 × 1 = 200 Ω. The 
overall transfer function is the product of low-pass 
transfer functions of the first and second orders:

Multiplying the open-circuit transfer functions corre­
sponds to cascading the circuits, with isolation, as dis-
cussed at the end of this section. The circuit is as 
shown in Figure 15.3, where isolation is provided 
by a unity-gain amplifier. The second-order cir-
cuit is shown preceding the first-order circuit. The 
same transfer function is of course obtained if the 
first-order circuit precedes the second-order cir-
cuit. In practice, the circuit that has the larger input 
impedance is generally preferred as the input cir-
cuit so as to minimize loading of the input source.
Simulation: Only the third-order circuit will be simu-
lated, since the second-order circuits were simulated 
in Chapter 14. The circuit is entered as in Figure 15.4. 
Simulation Settings are a start frequency of 1k, an end 
frequency of 100k, and 3000 points/decade. After the 
simulation is run, select DB(V(C2:1)). |HLP3(jω)| is dis-
played as in Figure 15.5. Using cursor search, the 3 dB 
cutoff frequency is read as 15.903K, the calculated value 
being 15.916  kHz. The high-frequency asymptote is 
entered as 60*LOG10(15915.5)-60*LOG10(Frequency). 
The phase shift is displayed by entering P(V(C2:1)) and 
varies between 0° at low frequencies to −270° at high 
frequencies. By entering sxval(15.9155k), the phase shift 
at the 3 dB cutoff frequency is read as −135.000. This 
is to be expected, since the phase shift at ω0 is −45° for 
the first-order filter (Figure 14.10b) and is −90° for the 
­second-order filter (Figure 14.28b).
Example 15.2:  Second-Order and Third-Order

It is required to design a high-pass Butterworth filter hav-

in Figure 15.9. Using cursor search, the 3  dB cutoff fre-
quency is read as 15.903K, the calculated value being 
15.916  kHz. The low-frequency asymptote is entered as 
–60*LOG10(15915.5) + 60*LOG10(Frequency). The phase 
shift is displayed by entering P(V(R2:1)) and varies between 
270° at low frequencies to 0° at high frequencies. By entering 
sxval(15.9155k), the phase shift at the 3 dB cutoff frequency 
is read as 135.000. This is to be expected, since the phase 
shift at ω0 is 45° for the first-order filter (Figure 14.11b), and 
is 90° for the second-order filter (Figure 14.31b).

Consider three, identical, low-pass, first-order filters that 
are cascaded with isolation. (a) Determine the ratio of the

that at very low frequencies; (b) compare with ratio of the 
responses for a third-order Butterworth low-pass filter hav-
ing the same  3 dB  cutoff frequency as the single filter in (a). 
Express the ratio in terms of dB and as a decimal fraction.
Ans. (a) −9 dB, (0.707)3 = 0.354; (b) −3 dB, 0.707.

15.2.1  Product of Transfer Functions
It is opportune at this stage to emphasize how the 
product of transfer functions is implemented. Consider 
two circuits ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ having open-circuit trans­
fer functions H1(s) and H2(s), as in Figure 15.10a 
and b. What happens when these two circuits are cas-
caded, as in Figure 15.10c? The overall transfer function

where, in cascading, the output voltage V
s
O1¢ ( ) of ‘N1’ is 
applied as the input voltage of ‘N2’. Note that H2(s) is the 
same, because ‘N2’ is open-circuited in Figure 15.10b 
and c. However, V
s
O1¢ ( ) in Figure 15.10c is not the same as 
VO1(s) in Figure 15.10a because the current I12 that flows 
between the two cascaded circuits alters, in general, the 
output voltage of ‘N1’. This means that the transfer func-
tion H(s) should be derived by analyzing circuits ‘N1’ and 
‘N2’ together. In some cases, however, the transfer func-
tions of the two individual circuits can be simply mul-
tiplied together to obtain the overall transfer function, 
which is the case when the second circuit has no effect 
on the first. We wish to clarify under what conditions this 
occurs. There are three general cases to consider:
	
1.	When I12 is zero or insignificantly small. I12 is 
zero if an isolating amplifier, of infinite input 
impedance, is interposed between the two cir-
cuits, as in Figure 15.7. I12 is insignificantly 
small when the input impedance of ‘N2’, that is,

 is large compared with the output 
impedance of ‘N1’, which is Thevenin’s imped-
ance looking into the output terminals of ‘N1’, 
with the input source set to zero. This case was 
considered in Problem P14.45.
	
2.	When the output of ‘N1’ is an ideal voltage source, 
as when this output is that of an ideal op amp. In 
this case the open-circuit output voltage of ‘N1’ is 
the same as in the presence of a finite I12 because, 
by definition of an ideal voltage source, the source 
voltage is independent of the source current. 
Many such cases will be encountered later on, as 
in the case of the broadband filter (Figure 15.14).
	
3.	When ‘N2’ input is a virtual ground. In this case, 
I12(s)/VI1(s) is determined by ‘N1’ alone, and 
VO2(s)/I12(s) is determined by ‘N2’ alone. The 
overall transfer function is then the product of 
these two individual transfer functions. This is 
the case when ‘N2’ is an op amp in the inverting 
configuration.
Another point that should be kept in mind is that 
when transfer functions are multiplied in the frequency 
domain, their magnitudes are multiplied together and 
their phase angles are added together. Thus,

15.3  First-Order Active Filters
Op amps may be used with RC circuits to construct 
active filters. RC, rather than RL, circuits are used for 
this purpose, because capacitors are less bulky and 
expensive than inductors and are closer to an ideal cir-
cuit element. Moreover, inductors are more awkward 
to implement in integrated circuits than capacitors. 
Op amps in active filters can be used to provide gain, 
isolation, load drive, and a higher Q for improved per-
formance. Q of Butterworth filters exceeds 0.5, which 
means that such filters cannot be realized using RC 
circuits alone, since the maximum Q of these filters 
is 0.5. Active filters are extensively used for frequen-
cies up to a few megahertz, limited by the frequency 
response of op amps. For higher ­frequencies, pas-
sive filters are generally used. The simplest forms 
of active filters are the first-order ­filters discussed in 
this section.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
15.3.1  Low-Pass Filter
The transfer function of the ideal integrator is 
Hint(s) = −1/sCfRr (Equation 13.25). The Bode magnitude 
plot is −20log10(ωCfRr), which is a straight line of slope 
−20 dB/decade that intersects the 0 dB line at ω = 1/CfRr, 
as this gives log10(1) = 0 (Figure 15.11a). The gain is high 
at low frequencies because of the reactance 1/ωCf of the 
capacitor, which makes Zf/Zr → ∞ as ω → 0 (Equation 
13.22). In order to have a low-pass characteristic, the 
response must become flat at low frequencies, as indi-
cated by the thick horizontal line in Figure 15.11a, which 
coincides with the 0 dB line for log10ωCf Rr < 1. This can 
be achieved by connecting a resistance Rf in parallel 
with Cf (Figure 15.11b), so that at low frequencies, as the 
­reactance of the capacitance becomes very large, the 
gain of the amplifier becomes essentially independent 
of ­frequency. The transfer function is

where ωcl = 1/CfRf. The transfer function HLP1(s) is that 
of a first-order low-pass response having a cutoff fre-
quency wcl and a gain of −Rf/Rr as s → 0.
Primal Exercise 15.11
A filter of the type of Figure 15.11b is required to have 
a passband gain of −10 and a 3 dB cutoff frequency 
of 1 krad/s, using a 0.1 μF capacitor. Determine Rr and Rf .
Ans. Rr = 1 kW, Rf = 10 kW.
15.3.2  High-Pass Filter
Interchanging resistors and capacitors in the low-
pass filter results in a high-pass filter (Exercise 
15.13). However, the passband gain in this case is 
given by the ratio of two capacitances, which is not 
as convenient to control precisely as the ratio of two 
resistances.
Alternatively, a high-pass filter using two resis-
tors and a capacitor can be derived from the 
ideal differentiator, whose transfer function is 
Hdif(s)  =  −sCrRf (Equation 13.27). The Bode magni-
tude plot is +20log10(ωCrRf), which is a straight line 
of slope + 20 dB/decade that intersects the 0 dB line 
at ω = 1/CrRf (Figure 15.12a). The gain is Rf divided 
by (1/ωCr) and is high at high frequencies because 
of the small reactance 1/ωCr of the capacitor, since 
Zf/Zr → ∞ as ω → ∞ (Equation 13.22). In order to have 
a high-pass characteristic, the response must become 
flat at high frequencies, as indicated by the thick hori-
zontal line in Figure 15.12a, which coincides with the 
0 dB line  for log10ωCf Rr > 1. This can be achieved by 
connecting a resistance Rr in series with Cr (Figure 
15.12b), so that at high frequencies, as the reactance 
of the capacitance becomes very small, the gain of 
the amplifier becomes essentially independent of fre-
quency. The transfer function is

Specify the type of response VO(jω)/VSRC(jω) in Figure 15.13.
Ans. Ideal integrator.
As explained in Section 14.2, a second-order bandpass 
response can be obtained by multiplying low-pass and 
high-pass responses. This is conveniently accomplished 
using active filters. When the upper 3 dB cutoff frequency 
of the resulting bandpass response is much larger than 
the lower 3 dB cutoff frequency, the filter is referred to 
as broadband. The design of such a filter is particularly 
simple, as illustrated by the following Example.
Example 15.3:  Broadband Bandpass Filter
It is required to design a broadband bandpass filter in 
the audio frequency range 20 Hz to 15 kHz, having a 
passband gain of 5, using 50 nF capacitors and op amps 
in the inverting configuration.
Solution:
The overall transfer function is the product of the 
low-pass and high-pass transfer functions given by

The filter behaves as a low-pass filter of 3 dB cutoff fre-
quency ωc2 that is hardly affected by ωc1. In other words, 
as long as ωc2 is at least 10 times ωc1, each filter has a 
negligible effect on the other, so that the two filters can be 
designed separately.
For the high-pass filter, Rrh = 1/(ωc1Crh) = 1/(2π × 20 × 
50 × 10−9) ≅ 160 kΩ. For the low-pass filter, Rfl = 1/(ωc2Cfl) = 
1/(2π × 15,000 × 50 × 10−9) ≅ 210 Ω. K = RflRfh/RrlRrh = 5. 
We may choose Rfh = 400 kΩ, so Rrl = 105 Ω. The filter 
circuit is shown in Figure 15.14. As mentioned in con-
nection with Figure 15.3, it is more advantageous that 
the high-pass filter precedes the low-pass filter in this 
case in order to have a higher input impedance.
It should be noted that according to the statement 
of the problem, ωc1 = 2π × 20 rad/s and ωc2 = 2π × 15 
krad/s, which gives a 3 dB bandwidth of (ωc2 − ωc1). 
But the cascading of the low-pass and high-pass fil-
ters results in a bandpass bandwidth of (ωc2 + ωc1), in 
accordance with Equation 15.36, in which the coeffi-
cient of s in the denominator is (ωc2 + ωc1). This wider 
bandwidth is due to the effect of one filter on the other, 
which has been neglected in the preceding solution for 
the sake of a much simplified design procedure. When 
ωc2 ≫ ωc1, the resulting error is small. It is in this case 
((fc2 + fc1) − (fc2 − fc1))/(fc2 − fc1) = 2fc1/(fc2 − fc1) = 40 Hz/
(15 kHz − 20 Hz). This evaluates to about 0.3% and is in 
fact erring on the right side, as a slightly wider band-
width is generally more desirable. This discrepancy is 
quite acceptable, considering that, in practice, the tol-
erance on the values of commonly used components is 
at least ±2% for resistors and ±5% for capacitors.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 15.15. 
Simulation Settings are a start frequency of 1 Hz, an end 
frequency of 100  kHz, and 2000  points/decade. After 
the simulation is run, select DB(V(U2:OUT)). |HBP3(jω)| 
is displayed as in Figure 15.16. Using cursor max, the 
maximum gain in the passband is read as 13.968  dB

As ω → ∞, the capacitors act as short circuits. R2 is 
connected across vSRC and is redundant as far as vO is 
concerned. R1 is connected between vSRC and the ideal 
voltage source output of the ideal op amp. It is also 
redundant because the current through it only affects 
the currents in these ideal sources and nothing else in 
the circuit. With C1 and C2 replaced by short circuits and 
R1 and R2 removed, the circuit reduces to a noninverting 
amplifier of gain A.
As ω  →  0, the capacitors act as open circuits. The 
amplifier is isolated from the input source, its input is 
grounded, through R2, so that the output is zero. The 
response is therefore high pass.
To facilitate the design, A is set to 1, that is, the ampli-
fier is connected as a unity-gain amplifier. To normal-
ize the response, it is convenient to set C1 = C2 = 1 F, so 
that the coefficient of s, and hence Q, in Equation 15.41 
is determined by R2 only. To have ωch = 1 rad/s, R1R2 = 1.

Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 15.18. 
Simulation Settings are a start frequency of 10 Hz, an 
end frequency of 10 kHz, and 2000 points/decade. After 
the simulation is run, select DB(V(U1:OUT)). |HHP2(jω)| 
is displayed as in Figure 15.19. Using cursor search gives 
the 3 dB cutoff frequency as 500.591 Hz. The equation of 
the low-frequency asymptote is:
−20*LOG10(500)+20*LOG10(Frequency).
15.4.2  Low-Pass Filter
It was explained in connection with Table 14.3 that a 
low-pass filter can be derived from the high-pass filter 
or, conversely, by interchanging s and ω0. In the case 
of the active RC filters under consideration, this corre-
sponds to interchanging s and ωc, the 3 dB cutoff fre-
quency, by replacing every resistor of the filter circuit, 
that is, excluding Rr and Rf of the op amp, by a capaci-
tor, and conversely. In the transfer function, this replaces 
every Rm by 1/sCm, and every 1/sCk by Rk, or every Ck 
by 1/sRk. With wc

It is seen that making these replacements interchanges 
ωc/s and s/ωc, that is, interchanges s and ωc. The circuit 
in Figure 15.17 becomes that in Figure 15.20, where R1 in 
Equation 15.41 is replaced by 1/sC1, R2 by 1/sC2, C1 by 
1/sR1, and C2 by 1/sR2. After the resulting equation is 
simplified, the transfer function becomes

to open circuits. The circuit reduces to a noninverting 
configuration of gain A. As ω → ∞, the capacitors act 
as short circuits. C2 effectively grounds the input of the 
op amp, so the output is zero. The response is low pass.
To facilitate the design, the amplifier is connected as a 
unity-gain amplifier, so that A = 1. The response is con-
veniently normalized by setting R1 = R2 = 1 Ω, so that the 
coefficient of s, and hence Q is determined by C1 only.

Example 15.5:  Third-Order Noninverting 
Butterworth Low-Pass Filter
It is required to design a third-order, Butterworth low-
pass filter based on the circuit in Figure 15.20, having 
a gain of 3 and a 3 dB cutoff frequency of 2000 rad/s, 
using 1 kΩ resistors in the filter sections.
Solution:
Referring to Table 15.2, the normalized third-order 
Butterworth polynomial is (s2 + s + 1)(s + 1). Equating the 
unity coefficient of s in s2 + s + 1 to 2/C1 in Equation 15.44 
gives C1 = 2 F, so that C2 = 0.5 F in the normalized filter. To 
move the cutoff frequency to 2000 rad/s requires kf = 2000. 
To use 1 kΩ resistors requires km = 1000. It follows that 
C1 = (2 F)/(1000 × 2.000) = 1 μF and C2 = C1/4 = 0.25 μF.
The normalized first-order filter has R = 1 Ω, C = 1 F, and 
ωcl = 1 rad/s. It has, therefore, the same kf and km as the sec-
ond-order filter. Hence, C = (1 F)/(1000 × 2.000) = 0.5 μF. If 
the first-order filter is implemented using an active filter 
(Figure 15.11b), the overall gain is negative, which requires 
an additional inverting amplifier stage to obtain a positive 
overall gain. Alternatively, a simple RC low-pass filter can 
be used, followed by a noninverting amplifier having a 
gain of three. The amplifier isolates the RC filter from the 
load so as to have the required transfer function. The filter 
circuit is shown in Figure 15.21. The first-order filter could 
precede the second-order filter in this case.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 15.22. 
Simulation Settings are a start frequency of 10 Hz, an end 
frequency of 10 kHz, and 2000 points/decade. After the 
simulation is run, select DB(V(U2:OUT)). |HLP3(jω)| is 
displayed as in Figure 15.23. The passband gain is read 
from the  cursor as 9.542  dB, which equals 20log10(3). 
Cursor search  gives the 3 dB cutoff frequency as 
318.058 Hz, compared to a calculated value of 318.31 Hz. 
The equation of the high-frequency asymptote is 
20*LOG10(3) + 20*LOG10(318.31) −20*LOG10(Frequency).

 in the 
denominator; s cancels out from the numerator and 
denominator, which gives the maximum gain as 
K = (A/C1R3)/(ω0/Q) = QA/(ω0C1R3).
That the response is bandpass can be readily checked. 
As ω → 0, C1 isolates the input of the op amp from the 
source and the output is zero. As ω → ∞, C2 grounds the 
input of the op amp, and the output is again zero. This 
implies that the nonzero output is a maximum at some 
intermediate value, so the response is bandpass.
It will be noted that normalizing Equation 15.45 is not 
as simple as in the low-pass and high-pass filters. A filter 
of this type is considered in Problem P15.43. An invert-
ing bandpass filter that is easier to design is presented 
in the next section.

That the response in Figure 15.25 is bandpass can be 
readily ascertained. As ω → 0, the capacitors act as open 
circuits, no current passes through R1, the output termi-
nal is at virtual ground, and the output voltage is there-
fore zero. As ω → ∞, the capacitors act as short circuits, 
thereby connecting the output terminal directly to virtual 
ground and resulting in zero output voltage. The non-
zero output voltage must have a maximum magnitude 
at some intermediate value, so the response is bandpass.
If the filter response is normalized by having 
C1 = C2 = 1 F and ωo = 1 rad/s, Equation 15.46 becomes

Equation 15.48 is the transfer function of a high-pass 
response, the circuit being as in Figure 15.28.
As ω → 0, the capacitors act as open circuits, no cur-
rent passes through R1, the output terminal is at virtual 
ground, and the output voltage is therefore zero, as in 
Figure 15.25. As ω → ∞, the reactances of the capaci-
tors become very small and the transfer function Zf/Zr 
approaches −C3/C2, as in Equation 15.48.
The

can 
be 
normalized 
by 
setting 
C1 = C2 = C3 = 1 F, ωch = 1 rad/s, so that R1R3 = 1, and

where ω0 = 1/RC and Q is a designated value. The input 
combinations for the different responses are indicated 
in Table 15.3. To obtain a low-pass response, for exam-
ple, the input is applied as VSRC1(jω), with the other two 
inputs connected to ground.
Equation 15.52 can be derived by the node-voltage 
method; voltage variables are assigned to the essential 
nodes at ‘P’, ‘O’, and the essential nodes between the 
two capacitors and the two resistors. KCL is derived 
at each of these nodes and the resulting simultaneous 
equations solved. It is simpler and more instructive to 
derive Equation 15.52 using the substitution theorem 
(Section 4.4).
Since the amplifier is unity-gain, the voltage at the non-
inverting input ‘P’ of the op amp is the same as the output 
voltage VO(jω) at node ‘O’. The op amp can therefore be 
replaced by an ideal independent voltage source VO(jω) 
between node ‘O’ and ground, and the branch connected 
between node ‘P’ and ground can also be replaced by 
this source, in accordance with the substitution theorem.

Since nodes ‘P’ and ‘O’ are at the same voltage VO(jω) 
with respect to ground, they can be connected together. 
The circuit in the frequency domain becomes as in 
Figure 15.31. We wish to determine the currents I1 and I2. 
The circuit for I1 is shown in Figure 15.32a.
The voltage drop across R on the RHS is RI1, which is also 
the voltage across the capacitor. The capacitor current is 
therefore 2sCRI1. The total current is I1(1 + 2sCR). From KVL, 
VSRC1(jω) = RI1(1 + 2sCR) + RI1 + VO(jω). It follows that

in the same way as I1 in Figure 15.32a. Alternatively, it 
may be noted that if R and 1/sC in Figure 15.32a are 
replaced by 1/sC and R, respectively, the circuit of 
Figure 15.32b is obtained. Making these replacements in

Example 15.7:  Notch Filter
It is required to configure the universal filter as a band-
stop filter having a center frequency of 1 krad/s and a Q 
of 50 using 0.1 μF capacitors.
Solution:
R  =  1/(ω0C)  =  1/(103  ×  10−7)  =  10  kΩ. For a Q of 50, 
2RQ = 20 × 103 × 50 = 1 MΩ, and C/(2Q) = 10−7/100 = 1 nF.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 15.33.

an  end  frequency of 300  Hz, and 5000  points/decade. 
After  the simulation is run, select DV(U1:OUT). 
|HBP2(jω)|  is displayed as in Figure 15.34. The mini-
mum gain of zero is read from cursor minimum as at 
159.148, compared to a calculated value of 159.155 Hz. 
Cursor search gives the upper 3 dB cutoff frequency 
fc2 as 160.755 and the lower 3 dB cutoff frequency fc1 as 
157.571. This gives BW = 3.184 Hz, corresponding to a Q 
of 159.148/3.184 = 49.98.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 Scaling is a convenient procedure based on 
designing a certain type of filter in normal-
ized form and then scaling the values of these 
normalized filters as may be required for any 
particular implementation of this type of 
filter.
	
1.	 For a normalized first-order filter, the values 
chosen are ωc = 1 rad/s, R = 1 Ω, C = 1 F, and 
L = 1 H.
	
2.	 For a normalized second-order filter, the 
values chosen are ωc = 1 rad/s, C = 1 F, and 
L = 1 H. The normalized R is chosen to give 
the required value of Q.

 where the frequency 
scaling factor kf is determined by the desired ωc,  
ω0, or BW, and the magnitude scaling factor km is 
determined by the desired value of some circuit 
parameter.
	
1.	 BW scales like ω, Q is unaffected by scaling.
•	 Scaling can be applied to any filter when it 
is desired to change a parameter value or 
frequency.
•	 A Butterworth low-pass or high-pass response is 
a maximally flat response in the passband. The 
reason for this is that in the expression for the 
magnitude of a Butterworth polynomial of order 
n, the only term in ω is a term raised to the power 
2n, so that the change in the attenuation with fre-
quency in the passband is as small as possible.
•	 In a normalized Butterworth, low-pass response 
of order n, the normalized Butterworth polyno-
mial is the denominator of the transfer func-
tion, the numerator of the transfer function 
being unity. The magnitude of the normalized, 
Butterworth low-pass response of order n is of 
the form 1
1
2
/
+ u n , where u = ω/ωc.
•	 In 
a 
normalized 
Butterworth, 
high-pass 
response of order n, the normalized Butterworth 
polynomial is the denominator of the transfer 
function, the numerator of the transfer func-
tion being sn. The magnitude of the normalized, 
Butterworth high-pass response of order n is of 
the form u
u
n
n
/ 1
2
+
.
•	 All Butterworth low-pass or high-pass responses 
have an attenuation of −3 dB with respect to the 
passband gain at ω = ωc, irrespective of n. ωc is 
both the 3 dB cutoff and the corner frequency. 
The magnitude of the slope of the asymptote of 
the response is 20n dB/decade.
•	 Op amps in active filters provide gain, isolation, 
load drive, and high Q.
•	 Op amps are used with RC circuits to surpass 
the limit of Q = 0.5 for passive RC circuits and 
implement active, Butterworth RC filters hav-
ing Q > 0.5.
•	 A first-order low-pass active filter can be 
derived from an ideal integrator by connecting 
a resistor in parallel with the capacitor in order 
to limit the gain at low frequencies.
•	 A first-order high-pass active filter can be 
derived from an ideal differentiator by  con-
necting a resistor in series with the capacitor in 
order to limit  the gain at high frequencies.
•	 A second-order, broadband, bandpass filter can 
be implemented by cascading a first-order low-
pass active with a first-order high-pass active 
filter. The two filters can be designed separately, 
as long as the 3 dB cutoff frequencies are at least 
a decade of frequency apart.
•	 Second-order low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, 
and bandstop active filters having any desired Q 
may be constructed using operational amplifiers 
in the noninverting or inverting configuration.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Scaling is convenient to use in filter design. In 
applying scaling, remember that, in general, 
values of L and C are scaled by both frequency 
and magnitude scale factors, that bandwidth 
scales like frequency, and that Q is invariant with 
scaling.
	
2.	Always determine how an active filter circuit 
behaves at ω → 0, as ω → ∞.
	
3.	In all types of filters (low pass, high pass, band-
pass RLC, and bandstop RLC), it is generally 
possible to determine the gains of interest from 

Butterworth and Active Filters	
465
the circuit, without deriving the transfer func-
tion, by examining the circuits at the frequency 
extremes (ω → 0 and ω → ∞) or at the resonant 
frequency ω0. However, in the case of bandpass 
RC circuits, the maximum gain can only be 
derived, in general, from the transfer function.
	
4.	The 3 dB cutoff frequency of a first-order filter 
can be obtained from RTh seen by the energy 
storage element without having to derive the 
transfer function.

Responses to Periodic Inputs
Objective and Overview
Chapter 8 was concerned with the sinusoidal steady state 
in which all the sources applied to a given circuit are of 
the same frequency. This case can be readily generalized 
to inputs that are nonsinusoidal but periodic. The basis 
for this generalization is Fourier’s theorem, according 
to which a periodic signal of a given frequency can be 
expressed, in general, as an infinite series of sine and 
cosine functions whose frequencies are integral multi-
ples of the frequency of the periodic signal. The ampli-
tudes of the higher-frequency sinusoids decrease fairly 
rapidly in most cases so that the periodic signal can be 
represented in practice by a finite sum of sinusoids.
Once a periodic signal is represented as a series expan-
sion of sinusoids of different frequencies, the response 
of a linear time-invariant (LTI) circuit to the periodic 
signal is the sum of the responses to the individual fre-
quency components. The different frequencies do not 
interact in an LTI circuit so that each of these responses 
can be obtained using phasor analysis, as was done in 
Chapter 8.
Circuit responses to periodic signals are of consider-
able practical interest, because these signals are very 
common. The steady state of any linear or nonlinear cir-
cuit, other than the dc steady state, is periodic. Thus, the 
outputs of free-running oscillators, the time bases of TV 
and computer displays, and continuous vibrations of all 
kinds are periodic signals.
The Fourier series expansion (FSE) of periodic func-
tions can be generalized to nonperiodic functions by 
means of the Fourier transform (Chapter 23).
This chapter begins by presenting Fourier’s theorem 
and deducing how the coefficients of the sine and cosine 
terms of the FSE can be obtained. The derivation of the 
FSE is significantly simplified if the given periodic func-
tion possesses some symmetry properties or if it’s the 
sum, the product, the derivative, or the integral of func-
tions whose FSE is already known. These simplifications 
are discussed in considerable detail. This is followed by 
considering circuit responses to periodic signals and the 
average power involved, leading to the definition and 
derivation of the root-mean-square (rms) value of a peri-
odic voltage or current.
16.1  Fourier Series
Figure 16.1 illustrates a periodic function f(t) of arbitrary 
waveform. Its period T is defined, like that of a sinu-
soidal function, as the time interval between successive 
repetitions of the same full range of values of the peri-
odic function.
Mathematically, the defining property of any periodic 
function f(t) of period T is
	
f t
f t
nT
( ) =
+
(
)	
(16.1)
for any t within the period T, where n is any positive or 
negative integer. This means that the function repeats 
every period T. Thus, In Figure 16.1, f(t0) has the same 
value as f(t0 + T), f(t0 − T), and so on for any integral 
multiple of T. The sinusoidal function discussed in 
Chapter 8 is an example of a periodic function so that 
the same definitions of cycle, frequency, and angu-
lar frequency for a sinusoidal function (Equation 8.2) 
apply to periodic functions in general. In particular, 
the reciprocal of T is the fundamental frequency of the 
periodic waveform.
From a mathematical viewpoint, a periodic time func-
tion extends over all time, from −∞ to +∞. In practice, 
a function can be assumed periodic if it has been in a 
steady state for a time interval that is large compared to 
the period, say, 10 times. Periodic functions need not be 
time functions. They can be spatial functions, in which 
case the period is the wavelength.

(16.2)
where
n is a positive integer
a0, an, and bn are constants, known as Fourier ­coefficients, 
that depend on f(t)
The component having n  =  1 is the fundamen-
tal and is represented by the sum of two terms, 
a1cosω0t + b1sinω0t, where ω0 = 2πf = 2π/T. The com-
ponent having n > 1 is the nth harmonic and is repre-
sented by the sum of two terms, ancosnω0t + bnsinnω0t. 
The series expression of Equation 16.2 is the Fourier 
series expansion (FSE) of f(t).
To appreciate the idea behind Fourier’s theorem, con-
sider the periodic triangular waveform of Figure 16.2 
having a unit amplitude and a period of 4 s. The FSE 
of the negation of this waveform is derived in Example 
16.5. The FSE of the waveform of Figure 16.2 is

(16.3)
Comparing Equations 16.2 and 16.3, it is seen that no 
sine terms are present in Equation 16.3 and the cosine 
terms are nonzero for odd values of n only. This is gen-
erally true of many FSEs, that is, some values of an and 
bn in Equation 16.2 may be zero in some cases. The first 
term in the FSE in Equation 16.3, which is (8/π2)cosω0t, 
is shown in Figure 16.3a for the first period, 0–4 s, and 
is a rough, first approximation to the triangular wave-
form. Adding the second term in the FSE, (8/9π2)cos3ω0t, 
which is the third harmonic, gives a better approxima-
tion, as in Figure 16.3b. Adding the fifth harmonic, the 
third term in the FSE, and higher harmonics in the FSE 
further improve the approximation.
Although periodic functions encountered in practice can 
be usually expressed as FSEs, it is mathematically of inter-
est to determine if Fourier’s theorem applies to any arbi-
trary periodic function. Dirichlet’s conditions, which are 
sufficient to ensure that the FSE of a given periodic function 
f(t) converges to f(t) for any t, may be stated as follows:
	
1.	The integral 
f t dt

2.	f(t) is single valued over a period, with only a 
finite number of finite discontinuities, maxima, 
or minima.
Combining the sine and cosine terms for the same n

16.2  Fourier Analysis
The object of Fourier analysis is to derive the Fourier 
coefficients of a given FSE. Some integral trigonometric 
relations needed for this purpose can be summarized as 
follows:
Summary: Given the four functions cosmω0t, sinmω0t, 
cosnω0t, and sinnω0t, where m and n are nonzero integers, the 
integral of the product of any two of these functions over 
the period of the fundamental, T = 2π/ω0, is zero, except for 
the products cos2nω0t and sin2nω0t, having m = n, in which 
case the integral is T/2.

Equations 16.6 through 16.8 are proved next, using 
basic trigonometric relations (Appendix B). The proof is 
based on the following basic concept:
Concept: The integral of the kth harmonic, sinkω0t or 
coskω0t, where k is a nonzero integer, is zero over the period of 
the fundamental component, T = 2π/ω0.
In Figure 16.4, the integral of the fundamental com-
ponent sinω0t is clearly zero over a period, such as that 
from t = 0 to T, since the area of a positive half-cycle is 
equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the area of a 
negative half-cycle. The integral of 0.5sin3ω0t between 
t = 0 and T is also zero because three full periods are 
included in this interval. In general,

Since m and n are integers, (m + n) or (m − n) is either 
a nonzero integer or a zero (m = n). The nonzero inte-
ger can be identified with k in Equation 16.9 so that the 
integrals on the RHS of (Equation 16.14) are zero. When 
m = n, the integrand of the second integral on the RHS 
of Equation 16.14 is zero, and the first integral is zero, so 
that the integrals on the RHS of Equation 16.14 are again 
zero. This proves Equation 16.6.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
As long as m ≠ n, (m + n) and (m − n) are nonzero inte-
gers, and the integrals are zero (Equation 16.10). If m = n, 
the first integral on the RHS of Equation 16.18 is zero, 
and the second integral is T, so that the RHS of Equation 
16.18 is T/2. This proves Equations 16.7 and 16.8 for the 
cosine functions. The proof for the sine functions follows 
along the same lines, starting with subtracting Equation 
16.15 from Equation 16.16, which gives the difference 
between two cosine functions rather than their sum.
Returning to Fourier analysis and the determination of 
Fourier coefficients, we note that a0 in the FSE is determined 
by integrating both sides of Equation 16.2 over a period:

a0 is therefore the average of f(t) over a period. It is the 
dc component of f(t), whereas the cosine and sine terms 
are the ac component.
We wish to determine next an and bn, where n refers 
to a particular positive integer in the range 1 to ∞, such 
as a3 or b5. But since it is common practice to also use n 
as an indexing positive integer in the range 1 to ∞, as in 
Equation 16.2, it is necessary to distinguish between the 
indexing positive integer in the range 1–∞ and a par-
ticular value in this range because both will occur in the 
same expression. We will denote the indexing integer in 
the FSE of Equation 16.2 by k and let n denote the order 
of the harmonic for which an and bn are to be determined.
If both sides of Equation 16.2 are multiplied by 
cosnω0t and are integrated over a period and invoking 
Equations 16.6 through 16.8, we obtain

The derivation of the Fourier coefficients can be 
­summarized as follows:
Summary: a0 is the average of f(t) over a period, an is twice 
the average of f(t)cosnω0t over a period, and bn is twice the 
average of f(t)sinnω0t over a period.
Primal Exercise 16.1
Express the following functions as FSEs and determine 
the period by applying the definition of periodicity 
( f(t) = f(t + nT)): (a) sin2tcos4t and (b) sin2t + sin5t + sin7t. 
Note that the fundamental frequency is the largest common 
factor of the frequencies of the individual components.
Ans. (a) −0.5sin2t + 0.5sin6t, π; (b) periodic of period 2π.

the period is a triangle of area AT/2, and the average 
over a period is the area divided by the period or A/2. 
An easier way of obtaining the average value in many 
cases is to determine by how much the horizontal axis 
should be moved so that the area enclosed by the func-
tion above the new horizontal axis is the same as the 
area enclosed by the function below this axis. It is seen 
that in Figure 16.5, if the horizontal axis is moved in 
the positive direction (i.e., upwards) by +A/2, as in 
Figure 16.6a, as much positive area is enclosed by the 
function as negative area. The average value is there-
fore +A/2.

(16.22)
The FSE of Equation 16.22 makes sense. For exam-
ple, if the dc component A/2 is subtracted from the 
FSE, the ac component, of zero average, is as shown 
in Figure 16.6a. The sinusoidal function that roughly 
approximates the waveform of Figure 16.6a is –Bsinω0t, 
where B is some appropriate amplitude. This agrees 
with the fundamental component in the FSE. The addi-
tional harmonics, all being negative sinusoids, improve 
the approximation.
At the points of discontinuity, where f(t) jumps between 
0 and A, t = kT, where k = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, …. The sinusoi-
dal terms are of the form sin(nω0 × kT) = sin(2πnk), where 
ω0T = 2π. Since nk is an integer, sin(2πnk) = 0. It follows 
that all the sinusoidal terms vanish at t = kT and f(t) = A/2, 
which is the average value of f(t) at the two ends of the 
discontinuity. This is a general feature of the FSE.
Problem-Solving Tips
•	 Remember that ω0T = 2π.
•	 When the period has a simple geometric form, a0 
can be easily determined by dividing the area over 
the period by the period T or by shifting the hori-
zontal axis so as to obtain a zero average. The aver-
age value is then equal to the shift of the horizontal 
axis. If the shift is upwards, the average value  is 
positive, and conversely.
•	 Whenever feasible, check if the form of the FSE 
makes sense as a rough approximation to the given 
periodic function.

where n = 0 gives the first term in Equation 16.29, posi-

ues of n give the last term. It should be noted, however, 
that whereas Equation 16.30 is the compact mathemati-
cal form, Equation 16.29 is the more practical form. This 
is because in some cases, as in Example 16.2, deriving Cn 
using Equation 16.25 and then setting n = 0 do not give 
a finite value for C0. In such cases, C0 is derived directly 
from the average value of f(t) and used in Equation 16.29.

where cn and θn are given by the relations of Equation 16.5.
Compared to the trigonometric form, the exponential 
form is advantageous for several reasons: (1) it is gener-
ally easier to apply Equation 16.25 to determine Cn rather 
than using Equations 16.20 and 16.21 to determine an 
and bn, (2) deriving Cn gives both an and bn simultane-
ously, and (3) some important properties of f(t), such as 
its frequency spectrum, are expressed directly in terms 
of Cn, as discussed next.
16.2.2  Frequency Spectrum
The plots of |Cn| and θn against frequency are, respec-
tively, the amplitude spectrum and the phase spectrum 
of f(t). They both constitute the frequency spectrum of f(t). 
Because frequencies in the FSE have discrete values only, 
the frequency spectrum of a periodic function is a line spec-
trum that consists of a series of lines at ω = nω0, where n = 0, 
±1, ±2, ±3, … (Figure 16.7). Since C

*, it is seen that 
|Cn| = |C−n| and ∠Cn =  − tan−1(bn/an) =  −  ∠C−n, because Cn

and its complex conjugate have the same magnitude but 
phase angles of opposite sign. The amplitude spectrum is 
therefore an even function, that is, it is symmetrical about 
the vertical axis (Figure 16.7a). Note that |C0| is the mag-
nitude of the dc component and |Cn| is half the amplitude 
of the fundamental component (n = 1) or the harmonics 
(n > 1), in accordance with Equation 16.32. The phase spec-
trum, on the other hand, is an odd function (Figure 16.7b). 
However, when Cn is purely real (bn = 0), then θn = 0°, when 
Cn > 0, or θn = 180°, when Cn < 0. In these cases, the negation 
of 0° or 180° is the same angle of 0° or 180°.
It should be noted that ω and ω0 are positive quan-
tities. Negative values of ω/ω0 in Figure 16.7 arise 
because of negative values of n that multiply a posi-
tive value of ω0 to give a negative value, −nω0. So 
negative values of nω0 are not negative frequencies, 
which have no physical meaning. Mathematically, 
these negative values combine with their positive 
counterparts in complex exponentials (Equation 
16.30) to give real cosine and sine terms, because all 
physical voltages and currents are real and cannot 
have imaginary components.
The exponential form of the FSE for the sawtooth 
waveform is derived in Example 16.2, together with its 
frequency spectrum. This example also demonstrates an 
important and useful technique, namely, that of deriv-
ing the FSE of a different but related version of a given 
f(t) from the already derived FSE of f(t).

Cn is imaginary, which means that an = 0 (Equation 
16.31). Note that the average value of fst(t) is A/2 and 
cannot be obtained by setting n = 0 in Equation 16.33. 
This is because if n = 0, then it should be substituted in 
the expression for Cn before integration. Otherwise, the 
integration would mean dividing by zero, which invali-
dates the result.

From Equation 16.33, |Cn| = A/2πn. The amplitude 
spectrum consists of a line of height A/2 at ω = 0 and 
lines of height A/(2πn) at nω/ω0, where n is a positive or 
a negative integer (Figure 16.8a). The height of A/(2πn) 
is one-half the amplitude of the fundamental or the nth 
harmonic. The phase angle of Cn is +90° for n, a positive 
integer, and −90° for n, a negative integer (Figure 16.8b).
Cn can be obtained using MATLAB’s int(E,t,a,b) 
command. Ignoring for the moment A/T2, the integral

Since fpt(t) is an even function, it is convenient to take

It follows that sinc(0)  =  1, as in Figure 16.11. For 
0 < x < π, sin(x) > 0, and sinc(x) > 0. For π < x < 2π, sin(x) < 0, 
and sinc(x) < 0. For x > 0, sinc(x) therefore has alternat-
ing positive and negative lobes between successive zero 
crossings at integral multiples of π. But since sinc(x) is a 
sine function divided by its argument, the magnitude of 
sinc(x) decreases as the magnitude of x increases. sinc(x) 
is an even function, because when x changes sign, sin(x) 
also changes sign, since sin(−x) = −sin(x).
Returning to Equation 16.36, we note that since Cn is 
real, bn = 0, and the FSE of fpt(t) function does not have 
any sine terms. The reason for this is that the function 
is even, as explained in the next section. The average 
value of fpt(t) is Aτ/T. However, it can be obtained in 
this case by setting n = 0 in Equation 16.36, because in 
this case, the numerator of the integral is zero when 
n  =  0, so L’Hopital’s rule can be applied and gives a 
finite result.

The amplitude spectrum is easier to visualize if 
a particular value of α is selected, say, α = 1/5. From 
Equation 16.38, |Cn| = (A/5)|sinc(nπ/5)|. It is seen that 
|C0| = A/5, and the lines of the amplitude spectrum are 
bounded by the magnitude of the sinc function for con-
tinuous n, as illustrated in Figure 16.12a. The line spec-
tra occur at integer values of n = ω/ω0. The amplitude 
is zero for values of n that are integral multiples of 5. 
The phase spectrum is shown in Figure 16.12b. Since Cn 
is real, its phase angle is zero when Cn > 0 and is 180° 
when Cn < 0. The phase angle is zero when n = 0, since 
C0 = A/5 is positive and is not defined, strictly speaking, 
when Cn = 0, as when n = ±5, because the phase angle 
can be zero or 180° when the magnitude is zero.
If α is small, it is seen from Equation 16.40 that the fun-
damental and harmonics all have essentially the same 
amplitude 2αA, since for small x, sinx ≅ x. This is an

16.2.3  Translation in Time
The exponential form is convenient for determining the 
effect of translation in time. If a periodic waveform f(t) is

time origin. Replacing t by (t − td) in Equation 16.30,

where θn is the phase angle of Cn. Conversely, if the 
function is advanced by ta, Cn is replaced by Cne+jnω0ta; the 
phase angle θn is increased by nω0ta. Note that a change 
in θn (Equation 16.32) implies a change of nω0td in the 
phase angle of each term of the FSE (Equation 16.4).
Example 16.4:  Translation in Time 
and Fourier Analysis of Square Wave
It is required to derive the FSE of the square wave 
(Figure 16.12) when delayed or advanced by T/4.
Solution:
Since td = T/4, nω0td = nω0T/4 = nπ/2. When a function is 
delayed in time, a given part of the waveform will occur 
later in time, which means that the function is shifted 
to the right. Thus, consider the transition that occurs 
at t = −T/4 in Figure 16.13 from −Am to +Am. When the 
function is delayed by T/4, this same transition will 
occur at t = 0. In effect, the function is shifted by T/4 
to the right (Figure 16.14a). Conversely, if the function 
is advanced in time by T/4, the same transition now 
occurs at t = −T/2. In effect, the function is shifted by 
T/4 to the left (Figure 16.14b).

As argued in connection with Figure 16.6, +sinω0t is

a first approximation in shape to the square wave of 
Figure 16.14b.
Simulation: PSpice can be used to (1) obtain a file 
printout of the amplitude and phase of each fre-
quency component of a periodic waveform and (2) 
display the amplitude spectrum of a periodic wave-
form. Periodic sources are available in PSpice, such 
as VPULSE and VSIN from the SOURCE library, 
which can be modified using parts from the analog 
behavioral module (ABM) Library. For example, a 
VSIN source followed by an ABS block from the ABM 
Library can be used to generate a full-wave rectified 
waveform (Figure 16.27b). VPULSE can be used to 
generate practically any periodic waveform of rect-
angular, triangular, or trapezoidal pulses by proper 
choice of pulse durations and rise and fall times. More 
general periodic waveforms consisting of straight-
line segments can be generated by the source VPWL_
RE_FOREVER (Example 16.8).
The square waveform of Figure 16.14a is simulated, 
assuming Am = 5 V and T = 2 s. VPULSE (Appendix C) is 
used to obtain a pulse train of 10 V peak-to-peak ampli-
tude and zero average value, as in Figure 16.15. The 
output is labeled vo using net alias. To run the simula-
tion, Time Domain (Transient) is selected for Analysis 
type, 6 is entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving 
data after’, and 0.1m for ‘Maximum step size’. In the 
same Simulation Settings window, select Output File 
Options. In the new Transient File Output Options win-
dow, select Perform Fourier Analysis, and enter 0.5 for 
‘Center Frequency’, 9 for ‘Number of Harmonics’, and 
V(vo) for ‘Output variables’. After the simulation is run, 
selecting Trace/Add Trace and then V(vo) displays vo 
as a function of time. Selecting Trace/Fourier displays 
the amplitudes of the Fourier components as a function 
of frequency. Expand the x-axis by selecting Plot/Axis 
settings and define an x-axis range of 0–5 Hz. The plot 
of Figure 16.16 is displayed. To label the first peak, for 
example, enter the cursor command sxv(0.5). After the 
cursor moves to the peak, press the Mark Label icon. The 
peak value is displayed as 6.3663 corresponding to a cal-
culated value of 4Am/π = 20/π = 6.3662. The other peaks 
are inversely proportional to the order of the harmonic, 
in accordance with Equation 16.44. Note that the ampli-
tude of the Fourier components displayed by PSpice is 
cn = 2|Cn| (Equation 16.32).
To view the printout, select View Simulation Output 
File from the Schematic1 page and scroll down to the

The phase spectrum of fsqa(t) is 90° for positive n. In all

Such a function is even, that is, feven(t) = feven(−t), because 
all of its components are even. If an odd function, such 
as 4sinω0t, is added to the even components, then the 
function is no longer even, since 4sinω0(−t) = −4sinω0(t). 
This leads to the following general concept:
Concept: The FSE of an even periodic function does not con-
tain any sine terms; its Fourier coefficients can be evaluated 
over half a period.
When the function is even, a period of the function 
is centered about the vertical axis, from −T/2 to +T/2. 
Since the FSE of an even periodic function does not con-
tain any sine terms, bn = 0 and Cn = an/2 is real. It follows

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Note that an even function can have a dc component 
and still remain even, because the dc component, being 
a constant, has even symmetry. Examples of even func-
tions are the rectangular pulse train (Figure 16.10) and 
the square waveform of Figure 16.13. The correspond-
ing FSEs (Equations 16.40 and 16.41) do not have any 
sine terms.
16.3.2  Odd-Function Symmetry
In a manner exactly analogous to that of even-function 
symmetry, it can be argued that an odd function can 
only contain odd terms, without any even terms. This 
implies that the FSE of an odd function consists of sine 
terms only without any cosine terms or a dc component. 
Thus, the following concept applies:
Concept: The FSE of an odd periodic function does not con-
tain an average term nor any cosine terms; its Fourier coef-
ficients can be evaluated over half a period.
When the function is odd, a period of the function 
extends from −T/2 to +T/2. Since the FSE of an odd 
periodic function does not contain any cosine terms, 
an = 0 and Cn = −jbn/2 is imaginary. It follows that

Note that the term between square brackets in 
Equation 16.51 is the imaginary component, including 
j and the sign.
An example of an odd function is the square waves 
of Figure 16.14. The FSEs of these functions (Equations 
16.44 and 16.45) consist of sine terms only.
Note that a periodic function that appears to be nei-
ther odd nor even can become odd when the dc compo-
nent is removed. An example is the sawtooth waveforms 
of Figures 16.5 and 16.9b. If the dc component A/2 is 
subtracted, the functions become odd, as illustrated in 
Figure 16.19. The FSEs (Equations 16.22 and 16.35) have 
a dc component and sine terms only, corresponding to 
an odd ac component. In such cases, Equations 16.51  
and  16.52 should be applied to the function after the 
dc component is removed.

The two forms of the definition in Equation 16.53 
are identical, since the second form is obtained by 
subtracting T from the argument of the first form, in 
accordance with the definition of a periodic function 
(Equation 16.1). An example of a half-wave symmetric 
waveform is shown in Figure 16.20, where increasing 
or decreasing t by T/2 negates the value of the func-
tion, in accordance with Equation 16.53. Geometrically, 
half-wave symmetry means that if either half-cycle or 
half-wave is displaced horizontally by T/2 toward the 
other half, so that the two half-waves are aligned verti-
cally, the half-waves are symmetrical with respect to 
the horizontal axis.

The reason, of course, why half-wave symmetric 
waveforms have odd harmonics only is that odd har-
monics, such as the third harmonic in Figure 16.21, are 
half-wave symmetric. Thus, if the half-wave of the third 
harmonic between T/2 and T in Figure 16.21 is shifted 
by T/2 to the left, it becomes symmetrical to the half-
wave of the third harmonic between 0 and T/2 with 
respect to the horizontal axis. On the other hand, even 
harmonics are not half-wave symmetric. Thus, if the 
half-wave of the second harmonic between T/2 and T in 
Figure 16.21 is shifted to the left by T/2, it coincides with 
the half-wave of the second harmonic between T/2 and 
T. In fact, if when the half-wave of a periodic waveform 
between T/2 and T is shifted to the left by T/2 it coin-
cides with the half-wave between 0 and T/2, then the 
FSE of the periodic waveforms contains even harmonics 
only. In effect, the period of such a waveform is T/2 rather 
than T. An example of such a waveform is the full-wave 
rectified waveform discussed later in Example 16.6.
It should be noted that if a dc component, which is 
even, is added to a half-wave symmetric periodic wave-
form, the half-wave symmetric property is destroyed, 
but the ac component still does not contain any even 
harmonics. In this case, Equations 16.54 and 16.57 
should be applied to the function after the dc compo-
nent is removed.
16.3.4  Quarter-Wave Symmetry
A half-wave symmetric function that is odd or even is 
also symmetrical about a vertical line through the mid-
dle of its positive or negative half-cycles. Consider, for 
example, the function of Figure 16.22a. The function is

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
half-wave symmetric, for if the negative half-cycle from 
0 to −T/2 is shifted to the right by T/2, the shifted half-
wave and the positive half-wave from 0 to T/2 are sym-
metrical with respect to the horizontal axis. If instead 
of being shifted to the right by T/2, the negative half-
wave is folded around the vertical axis, so that the point 
at −T/2 coincides with the point at T/2, the two half-
waves are again symmetrical with respect to the hori-
zontal axis. This implies that each of the positive and 
negative half-cycles is symmetrical about a vertical line 
through its middle. Note that the half-wave symmetric 
function of Figure 16.20 does not have this property.
Formally, this can be proved as follows, consid-
ering an odd function to begin with: from the defi-
nition of half-wave symmetry (Equation 16.53), 
f(t) =  − f(t − T/2), 0 ≤ t ≤ T/2. From the definition of 
an odd function, f(t) = −f(−t), which means that negat-
ing the argument negates the function. Negating the 
argument of −f(t − T/2) and the function, it becomes 
f(T/2 − t), so that

Equation 16.58 implies that f(t) is symmetrical about a 
vertical line through the middle of the positive half-cycle, 
at t = T/4, as illustrated in Figure 16.22a. From half-wave 
symmetry, f(t) is also symmetrical about the vertical line 
through the middle of the negative half-cycle.
If the odd function of Figure 16.22a is shifted by T/4 
to the left, it becomes the even function of Figure 16.22b. 
The symmetry about a vertical line through the middle 
of the positive or negative half-cycles is retained. A 
half-wave symmetric function that is also symmetrical 
about a vertical line through the middle of its positive 
or negative half-cycles is said to possess quarter-wave 
­symmetry. The square waves of Figures 16.15 and 16.16 
are examples of quarter-wave symmetric waveforms.
Since a quarter-wave symmetric waveform is also 
half-wave symmetric, the FSE of an odd, quarter-wave 
symmetric function consists of odd sine terms only, 
so that

In other words, bn need only be evaluated over a quar-

both f(t) and sinnω0t, with n odd, are symmetrical about 
the middle of the half-cycle from t = 0 to t = T/2.
Similarly, the FSE of an even, quarter-wave symmetric

This can be proved in the same way as for bn in the 
case of an odd, quarter-wave symmetric function. 
Again, this is because both f(t) and cosnω0t, with n odd, 
are symmetrical about the middle of the half-cycle from 
t = −T/4 to t = T/4.
Symmetry properties are summarized in Table 16.1.

It is required to determine the FSE of the triangular 
waveform of Figure 16.24.
Solution:
The function has zero average, is even, and possesses 
half-wave symmetry. It is also quarter-wave symmetric. 
Its FSE must contain odd cosine terms only. Over the 
interval 0 ≤ t ≤ T/4, ftr(t) = (4Am/T)(t − T/4). It follows

It is required to determine the FSE of (a) the half-wave 
rectified waveform of Figure 16.27a and (b) the full-
wave rectified waveform of Figure 16.27b.
Solution:
	 (a)	 The given half-wave rectified waveform can be 
considered to be the product of a cosine func-
tion of amplitude A and a square pulse train of 
unity amplitude, both functions having the same 
period T (Figure 16.28). The FSE of the pulse train 
is that of Equation 16.40, with A = 1 and α = 1/2.

itself. Hence,

	   The FSE contains a dc component A/π, a fun-

	 (b)	 The FSE of the full-wave rectified waveform of 
Figure 16.27b can be derived by considering it as 
the sum of a half-wave rectified waveform of ampli-
tude 2A and the function –Acosω0t (Figure 16.29). 
During the interval −T/4 ≤ t ≤ T/4, the ­negative

	   The FSE now contains both odd and even har-
monics of the fundamental frequency 
¢
w0.​ The 
­full-wave rectified waveform can also be derived 
in alternative ways (Problem P16.30).
Simulation: The half-wave and full-wave rectified wave-
forms are generated from a sinusoidal waveform of 2 V 
amplitude and 50  Hz frequency. The VSIN source is 
entered as in Figure 16.30, with a phase angle of 90° so 
as to obtain a cosine function as in Figure 16.27. The half-
wave rectified waveform is obtained by applying the sinu-
soidal voltage to a voltage limiter, available in PSpice from 
ABM library as the part LIMIT. The default settings of the 
limits are 0 and 10, which means that only voltages in the 
range 0 to 10 V will be allowed through the limiter. The 
negative half-cycles of the sinusoid are therefore removed 
and only the positive half-cycles will appear at the output 
of the limiter. This output is labeled ‘hw’ in Figure 16.30.
The full-wave rectified waveform is obtained by 
applying the sinusoidal voltage to the ABS part from the 
ABM library. The output of this module is the absolute 
value of the input, so that the negative half-cycles of the 
sinusoid are “inverted” and become positive half-cycles, 
as required for the full-wave rectified waveform. The 
output of the ABS module is labeled ‘fw’ in Figure 16.30.
The Fourier analysis is performed as described in 
Example 16.4. Time Domain (Transient) is selected for 
Analysis type, and 60m is entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 
for ‘Start saving data after’, and 10u for ‘Maximum step 
size’. In the new Transient File Output Options window, 
under ‘Perform Fourier Analysis’, 50 is entered for ‘Center 
Frequency’, 6 for ‘Number of Harmonics’, and ‘V(hw), 
V(fw)’ for ‘Output variables’. After the simulation is run, 
select Trace/Fourier and then Trace/Add V(hw) and Trace/
Add Trace V(fw), and expand the x-axis by selecting Plot/
Axis settings and define an x-axis range of 0 to 350 Hz. 
The plot of Figure 16.31 is displayed. Considering the 
amplitude of the Fourier components for the half-wave 
rectified waveform, shown dashed, the magnitudes of the 
successive peaks correspond to the calculated magnitudes 
of the terms in Equation 16.68 of 0.6366, 0.4244, 0.08488, 
and 0.03638, all in volts. The magnitudes of the successive 
peaks of the full-wave rectified waveform correspond to 
the calculated magnitudes of the terms in Equation 16.70 
of 1.2732, 0.8488, 0.1698, and 0.07276, all in volts. The out-
put file gives the same magnitude values. The positive 
nonzero harmonics have a phase angle of nominally +90°, 
whereas the negative nonzero harmonics have a phase 
angle of nominally −90°. These ±90° phase angles give the 
cosine terms in the FSEs, as in the source VSIN.

16.4.2  Differentiation/Integration
Concept: The FSE of a given periodic function can be differ-
entiated or integrated term by term. The result is the FSE of a 
periodic function that is the derivative or integral of the given 
function, except that integrating the dc component destroys 
the periodicity of the function.
This follows quite simply from differentiating or integrat-
ing both sides of the FSE. When a periodic function having 
a dc component is differentiated, the dc component van-
ishes and the resulting function is periodic with zero aver-
age. But when a periodic function having a dc component 
is integrated, the integral of the dc component increases lin-
early with time, which destroys the periodicity of the func-
tion, although the integrated ac component is still periodic.
Example 16.7:  Derivation of FSE through Integration
It is required to obtain the FSE of the triangular wave-
form of Figure 16.24 as the integral of the delayed square 
waveform of Figure 16.14a.

where the constant of integration C′ is the average 
value of the function. The RHS of Equation 16.72, with 
C′ = 0, is identical to ftr(t) (Equation 16.66), bearing in 
mind that the peak-to-peak amplitude of the triangu-
lar wave equals the area under one half-cycle of the 
square wave. Thus,

Simulation: The simulation is based on the square wave 
of Figure 16.14a having Am = 2 V, with zero average, and 
T = 2 s. The source VPULSE is used having the param-
eters shown in Figure 16.33. The source voltage is applied 
as the input to integrating module INTEG from the ABM 
library. If the waveform of Figure 16.13 is integrated start-
ing at t = 0, the resulting triangular waveform is always 
positive, that is, its ‘sits’ on the horizontal axis. To have 
a zero average, an initial value of −Amtr should be used 
in the integration, where Amtr is, from Equation 16.73, 
2 × (2/2)/2 = 1. Hence, −1 is entered as the IC for the inte-
gration, as shown in Figure 16.33. The resulting square 
and triangular waveforms are shown in Figure 16.34.
The Fourier analysis is performed as described in the 
preceding examples, the amplitude of the harmonic com-
ponents being shown in Figure 16.35. The magnitudes 
of the successive peaks of the square waveform, shown 
dashed, correspond to the calculated magnitudes of the 
terms in Equation 16.44 of 2.5465, 0.8488, 0.5093, 0.3638, 
and 0.2829. The magnitudes of the successive peaks of 
the triangular waveform correspond to the calculated 
magnitudes of the terms in Equation 16.66 of 0.8106 V, 
90.06 mV, 32.42 mV, 16.54 mV, and 10.10 mV. Note that 
the harmonics of the triangular waveform attenuate 
much more rapidly than those of the square waveform 
because they vary as 1/n2 rather than 1/n.
Example 16.8:  Fourier Simulation 
of Piece-Wise Linear Waveforms
It is required to obtain the FSE of the periodic waveform 
of Figure 16.36 analytically and by simulation, to dem-
onstrate the simulation of triangular, trapezoidal, and 
other piecewise-linear, periodic waveforms.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Simulation: The periodic waveform is generated in 
two ways. The first, illustrated in Figure 16.37a, utilizes 
two VPULSE sources having the parameters indicated. 
V1 generates a periodic, trapezoidal waveform, where 
the trapezoid in each period has a short base of 2 s, a 
long base of 4 s, a time-to-rise of 1 s, and a time-to-fall 
of 1 s. V2 generates a periodic, triangular waveform that 
is delayed by 1 s with respect to the trapezoid and has 
a base of 3 s, a height of 1 s, a time-to-rise of 2 s, and a 
time-to-fall of 1 s. Adding these two waveforms results 
in the periodic waveform of Figure 16.36.
The second method, illustrated in Figure 16.37b, uses the 
periodic, piecewise-linear source VPWL_RE_FOREVER 
from the source library. The source parameters are entered 
in the FIRST_NPAIRS field as coordinate pairs for each of 
the four corners, as indicated in Figure 16.37b.
The simulation is performed as described in the previ-
ous examples. The plot of the amplitudes of the Fourier 
components is shown in Figure 16.38 and is in agree-
ment with the calculated values.
16.5  Concluding Remarks on FSEs
16.5.1  Rate of Attenuation of Harmonics
FSEs are theoretically infinite series. In practice, a 
periodic waveform is truncated, that is, approxi-
mated by a finite number of terms of the FSE, to 
any desired degree of accuracy. The more rapidly 
the magnitudes of the harmonics decrease with the 
order of the harmonic, the fewer are the number of 
terms of the FSE that have to be included to obtain a 
given degree of accuracy. The rate of attenuation of 
harmonics is related to the degree of “smoothness” 
of the function:
Concept: The smoother the function, the more rapidly the 
harmonics decrease in magnitude.
To apply this concept, it is necessary to have some 
measure of the smoothness of a function. One such 
measure is obtained by successively differentiating 
the function to determine the order of the derivative 
that first becomes discontinuous, that is, shows a jump 
in value during every period. In the case of a square 
wave, for example, the function itself is discontinuous, 
twice in every period. The derivative of order 0, that 
is, the function itself is said to be discontinuous. The 
sawtooth waveform is also discontinuous, once every 
period. A triangular waveform such as that of Figure 
16.24 is continuous at the corners of the triangle, but 
the slope suddenly changes at these corners. In other 
words, the first derivative of the triangular waveform 
is a square wave and is discontinuous. Similarly, the 
half-wave and full-wave rectified waveforms are 
continuous but their first derivatives are not. In such 
cases, the first derivative or derivative of order 1 is 
discontinuous.

Responses to Periodic Inputs	
497
It can be shown that if the mth derivative of a peri-
odic function is discontinuous, with all the derivatives 
of lower order being continuous, the magnitudes of the 
harmonics decrease approximately as 1/nm + 1 ,  m = 0 , 1 , 
2 ,  …, the derivative of order 0 being the function itself. 
Thus, in the case of the square wave, the function is dis-
continuous, so that m = 0, and the harmonics decrease as 
1/n. In the case of a triangular waveform, the first deriv-
ative is discontinuous, m = 1, and the nth harmonic is 
proportional to 1/n2. Whereas the aforementioned state-
ment holds exactly for the square and triangular waves, 
it holds approximately for other functions. For example, 
the relative magnitudes of the harmonics of the pulse 
train decrease as sin(αnπ)/n (Equation 16.40), so the 1/n 
is multiplied by a sine function. In the case of the half-
wave and full-wave rectified waveforms (Equations 
16.68 and 16.70), the magnitude decreases as 1/(4n2 − 1). 
This property is useful for checking the FSE of a given 
periodic function.
16.5.2  Application to Nonperiodic Functions
A nonperiodic function that satisfies Dirichlet’s condi-
tions over a given interval can be represented over this 
interval by a Fourier series. It is convenient to choose 
this interval to be half a period of a periodic function 
and to assume that the periodic function is odd or even. 
If the periodic function is considered odd, its FSE will 
consist of sine terms only, whereas if the periodic func-
tion is considered even, its FSE will consist of cosine 
terms only. This is illustrated by Problem P16.19.
16.5.3  Shifting Horizontal and Vertical Axes
Shifting the time axis up or down affects the dc com-
ponent of the FSE without affecting the ac component. 
Shifting the vertical axis to the right or left (1) affects 
odd–even symmetry, without affecting half-wave or 
quarter-wave symmetry, that is, sine or cosine terms 
may be introduced in the FSE or removed from it, but 
if the periodic function is half-wave symmetric, only 
odd harmonics will be present, and (2) modifies the 
phase angles of the ac components, without affect-
ing their magnitudes and without affecting the dc 
component.
16.6  Circuit Responses to Periodic Functions
Concept: The steady-state response of an LTI circuit to a 
periodic signal is the sum of the responses to each component 
acting alone.
This follows readily from the principle of superpo-
sition (Section 5.1), which applies to all LTI systems. 
Consider a general periodic function vI(t) of the form of 
Equation 16.4:

If vI(t) is applied to an LTI circuit (Figure 16.39), vI(t) 
can be represented as the series connection of ideal 
voltage sources, each source representing a term in the 
FSE. From superposition, the output is the sum of com-
ponents, each component being due to one source act-
ing alone, with all the other sources set to zero, that is, 
replaced by short circuits.
Since the ac components of the input are sinusoids, 
the sinusoidal steady-state output due to each of these 
components can be determined by phasor analysis. 
Suppose vI of Equation 16.74 is applied to the circuit of 
Figure 16.40a. Figure 16.40b shows the circuit in the fre-
quency domain for the nth harmonic, where VIn is the 
input phasor VIn∠θIn, VOn is the output phasor VOn∠θOn, 
and the impedance of the capacitor at the frequency nω0

Example 16.9:  Response of RC Circuit 
to a Periodic Input
It is required to determine the output voltage vO(t) in Figure 
16.41 when the input voltage is the square waveform of 
Figure 16.14a, with Am = 5 V, T = 2 ms, R = 1 kΩ, and C = 1 μF.
Solution:
The FSE of the input voltage is given by Equation 16.44, 
with Am = 5 V. According to Equation 16.76, with R2 → ∞, 
R1 = R, and C2 = C, the nth harmonic of the output has

In general, the output waveform can be approxi-
mated to any desired degree of accuracy by adding a 
sufficient number of terms from the FSE of Equation 
16.79. However, it is possible in this case to obtain an 
“exact” expression for the output waveform in the 
steady state as the repetitive transient charging and 
discharging of the capacitor through a resistor. The 
procedure is as follows.
In the steady state, let the minimum vO(t) be VOmin at 
an arbitrary time t = 0 and at t = T, and let the maxi-

Solving Equations 16.81 and 16.83 gives VOmax  =

Note that if (t – T/2) in Equation 16.82 is replaced by t, 
the half-wave between T/2 and T is shifted by T/2 to the 
left. With VOmax = VOmin, the RHS of Equation 16.82 is the 
negation of the RHS of Equation 16.80, which implies 
that vO(t) is half-wave symmetric.

Simulation: The simulation is based on the square wave 
of Figure 16.14a having Am = 5 V, with zero average, and 
T = 2 ms. The source VPULSE is used having the param-
eters shown in Figure 16.43. The input and output wave-
forms shown in Figure 16.44 are obtained by entering in 
the simulation profile for Time Domain (Transient) anal-
ysis 20 m for ‘Run to time‘, 1u for ‘Maximum step size’, 
and 10 m for ‘Start saving data after’ in order to allow 
time for the initial transient to die down and the circuit 
to approach a steady state. vOmax and vOmin are read from 
the simulation as 2.3115 and 2.3053  V, respectively, in 
agreement with the calculated values.
The Fourier analysis is performed as described in the 
preceding examples, the amplitudes of the Fourier com-
ponents being shown in Figure 16.45. The input volt-
age is the same waveform as in Example 16.4 and has 
the same amplitudes (Figure 16.15). The amplitudes of 
the successive peaks of the output waveform are those 
given by Equation 16.79, the calculated magnitudes for 
the successive peaks being 1.9310 V, 0.2239 V, 80.893 mV, 
41.313 mV, and 25.002 mV.
The output file gives the following table for the output 
voltage:

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
From Equation 16.79, the calculated values of the 
phase angle −βn for the odd ac components are −72.34°, 
−83.94°, −86.36°, −87.40°, and −87.97°, respectively, in 
near agreement with the values in the table. Note that 
the phase angles in the fifth column of the table of 
Fourier  components in PSpice are for a sine function 
and not a cosine function.

16.7  Average Power and rms Values
Concept: In an LTI circuit, components of different frequen-
cies do not interact, and the total average power is the sum of 
the average powers due to each component acting alone.
To justify this, consider a periodic input voltage vI(t) 
of the form

Let this voltage be applied to two terminals of an LTI 
circuit. The input current iI(t) at these terminals in the 
steady state is also periodic, of the same frequency, and 
can be expressed as

The two product terms of an ac component of

V2I1 cos(2ω0t + θv2) cos(ω0t + θi1), also integrate to zero 
over a period. Thus, using the trigonometric iden-
tity cosαcosβ = (1/2)[cos(α − β) + cos(α + β)], the term 
V1I2 cos(ω0t + θv1)cos(2ω0t + θi2) = (1/2)[cos(ω0t + θi2 − 
θv1) + cos(3ω0t + θi2 + θv1)]. Each of these terms integrates 
to zero over a period, as in Equation 16.91.
Only the three terms in Equation 16.90, each of which 
is the product of a voltage and a current of the same 
frequency, do not integrate to zero over a period. Let

This result can be readily generalized to the case of

tively. The same procedure leads to the conclusion that

(16.96)
It is seen from Equation 16.96 that the average power 
is due only to components of voltage and current of the 
same frequency. The average power of each frequency 
component is given by the product of the rms voltage, 
the rms current, and cos(θvn − θin), the cosine of the phase 
difference between the voltage and current sinusoids of 
the same frequency. Multiplying by cos(θvn − θin) ensures 
that the average power is due the components of volt-
age and current that are in phase. Thus, if the voltage 
and current of a certain frequency component nω0 are 
in phase, as in the case of the voltage across a resistor 
and the current through it, θvn = θin, cos(θvn − θin) = 1, and 
average power dissipated is VnrmsInrms, in accordance 
with Equation 8.29. On the other hand, if the voltage and 
current are 90° out of phase, as in the case of the voltage 
across a capacitor or inductor and the current through it, 
θvn − θin = ±90°, cos(θvn − θin) = 0, and the average power 
is zero, in accordance with Equations 8.33 and 8.37.
It should be noted that the instantaneous power p(t) 
is a function of all the ac components of the signal, 
including the components of different frequencies and 
the components of frequency 2nω0, such as the 4ω0t 
term in Equation 16.94. However, only components of 
the same frequency contribute to the average power. Thus, 
in Figure 16.46, for example, the instantaneous power 
p varies with time in a manner that depends on all the 
terms present in the product of voltage and current. At 
any instant t1, the instantaneous power has a value p1 
that depends on the variation of p(t) with t. The aver-
age power P is such that over a period T, the area above 
the line P is the same as the area below the line P. This 
average power depends only on the voltage and current 
components of the same frequency.
It should be noted that when more than one indepen-
dent source of the same frequency is applied to an LTI 

502	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
circuit, the voltages and currents due to the individual 
sources interact with one another and are superposed, 
but the average powers due to these sources do not 
superpose, because the sum of squares of voltages or cur-
rents is not equal to the square of the sum, as explained 
in Section 5.1. However, when the various sources are 
of different frequencies, the voltages and currents due 
to the individual sources do not interact, that is, each 
response retains its individual identity, so that the aver-
age powers due to the sources of different frequency can 
be added together, in accordance with Equation 16.96. 
Superposition applies in this case to voltages, currents, 
and the average power.
16.7.1  rms Value
It is of interest to determine the rms value of a periodic

In other words, as its name implies, the rms value is 
obtained by squaring the given function, evaluating the 
mean or average of the square over a period, and then 
taking the square root of the mean. Assuming f(t) to be 
given by Equation 16.4,

When the sum between the square brackets is squared,

Hence, when the terms between the square brackets in

value. The summation in Equation 16.103 is over all 
the ac components of the FSE of the periodic ­function. 
According to Equation 16.103, the following concept 
applies:
Concept: The rms value of a periodic function is the square 
root of the sum of the squares of the rms values of the indi-
vidual components of the FSE.
In terms of a and b coefficients (Equation 16.5),

If a periodic voltage v(t) is applied across a resis-

to a voltage component Vnrms is Inrms  =  Vnrms/R, with 
θin = θvn. Substituting for Inrms in Equation 16.96 and using

If a periodic waveform f(t) is expressed analytically, 
it is usually much simpler to determine its rms value 
from direct application of Equation 16.97 rather than 
from its Fourier coefficients (Equation 16.98). Consider, 
for example, the half-wave rectified waveform of Figure 
16.27a given by Acosω0t, −π/2  ≤  ω0t  ≤  π/2, and zero 
over the rest of the period. The mean of its square over a 
period, which is the square of the rms value, is given by

The rms value is therefore A/2. The dc component is 
A/π (Equation 16.68). According to Equation 16.103, the 
rms value of a periodic function is the square root of the 
sum of the square of the dc component and the square of 
the rms value of the ac component of the periodic func-
tion. It follows that

Example 16.10  rms Value of Triangular Waveform
It is required to determine the rms value of the periodic 
triangular waveform f(t) shown in Figure 16.47 and 
deduce the rms value of the ac component.
Solution:
For 0 ≤ t ≤ τ, f(t) = (A/τ)t. The square of this waveform is 
(A/τ)2t2 and the area under the curve is

For τ ≤ t ≤ T, the area under the curve of the squared 
function can be more easily determined by noting that 
this area is the same as that for f1(t) in Figure 16.48. By 
analogy with Equation 16.110, the area under the square 
function is A2(T − τ)/3, τ ≤ t ≤ T. The total squared area for 
one period of f(t) is the sum A2τ/3 + A2(T − τ)/3 = A2 T/3. 
The mean is A2/3, and the rms value is A/ 3. Because it 
is independent of τ, this result applies to any triangular 
waveform that varies between 0 and A and repeats con-
tinuously without interruption. It applies, for example, 
to a sawtooth waveform having τ = 0, or τ = T.
Since the variation of f(t) over a period consists of 
straight-line segments, the dc or average value of f(t) is 
half the amplitude, which is A/2. If the rms value of the ac 
component is denoted by Fac ‐ rms, then A

Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 A periodic function f(t) is defined by the relation 
f(t) = f(t + nT) for any t within the period T, where 
n is any positive or negative nonzero integer.
	
1.	 The period T is defined, like that of a sinu-
soidal function, as the time interval between 
successive repetitions of the same full range 
of values of the periodic function. The recip-
rocal of T is the fundamental frequency of 
the periodic waveform, f0 Hz. It follows that 
ω0T = 2π.
•	 Given the four functions cosmω0t, sinmω0t, 
cosnω0t, and sinnω0t, where m and n are inte-
gers, the integral of the product of any two of 
these functions over a period T = 2π/ω0 is zero, 
except the products cos2nω0t and sin2nω0t, hav-
ing m = n, in which case the integral is T/2. The 
zero value of the integral of the product of dif-
ferent frequencies is based on the fact that the 
average of any harmonic over the period of the 
fundamental is zero.
•	 According to Fourier’s theorem, a periodic 
function f(t) can be expressed, in general, as an 
infinite series of cosine and sine functions in

•	 The plot of |Cn| against nω0 is the amplitude

The plot of ∠Cn against nω0 is the phase spec-

•	 If a periodic waveform f(t) is delayed by td, θn

if f(t) is advanced by td, θn is increased by

•	 In a half-wave symmetric waveform, if either 
half-cycle or half-wave is displaced hori-
zontally by T/2 toward the other half, the 
two half-waves are aligned vertically and 
are symmetrical with respect to the horizon-
tal axis. Mathematically, f(t) =  − f(t + T/2) or 
f(t) =  − f(t − T/2), 0 ≤ t ≤ T/2.

•	 A half-wave symmetric function that is also 
symmetrical about a vertical line through the 
middle of its positive or negative half-cycles is 
said to possess quarter-wave symmetry. Such 
a function can be made either odd or even by 
shifting the function in time.

•	 The FSE of some periodic waveforms can be 
derived from those of other periodic waveforms 
through addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
differentiation, or integration.
•	 The FSE of a given periodic function can be 
differentiated or integrated term by term. The 
result is the FSE of a periodic function that is 
the derivative or integral of the given func-
tion, except that integrating the dc component 
destroys the periodicity of the function.
•	 The smoother the function, the more rap-
idly the harmonics decrease in magnitude. 
Consequently, if the mth derivative of a peri-
odic function is discontinuous, with all the 
derivatives of lower order being continuous, 
the magnitudes of the harmonics decrease 

506	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
approximately as 1/nm+1, m = 0 , 1 , 2 ,  … , the 
derivative of order 0 being the function itself.
•	 Shifting the time axis up or down affects the 
dc component of the FSE without affecting 
the ac component. Shifting the vertical axis 
to the right or left (1) affects odd–even sym-
metry, without affecting half-wave or quarter-
wave symmetry, and (2) modifies the phase 
angles of the ac components, without affecting 
their magnitudes and without affecting the dc 
component.
•	 The steady-state response of an LTI circuit to a 
periodic signal is the sum of the responses to 
each component acting alone.
•	 In an LTI circuit, components of different fre-
quencies do not interact, and the total average 
power is the sum of the average powers due to 
each component acting alone.
•	 The rms value of a periodic function is the 
square root of the sum of the squares of the rms 
values of the individual components, bearing 
in mind that a dc value is the same as the rms 
value.
	
1.	 If a periodic waveform f(t) is expressed ana-
lytically, it is usually much simpler to deter-
mine its rms value from the definition of 
this value, that is, by squaring the function, 
deriving the average of this square, and tak-
ing the square root.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Remember that ω0T = 2π.
	
2.	When the period has a simple geometric 
form, a0 can be easily determined by divid-
ing the area over the period by the period T 
or by determining the shift of the horizontal 
axis that would result in the area enclosed by 
the function above the new horizontal axis is 
the same as the area enclosed by the function 
below this axis.
	
3.	Whenever feasible, check if the form of the FSE 
makes sense as a rough approximation to the 
given periodic function.
	
4.	When the Fourier coefficients an and bn are eval-
uated using expressions that restrict the values 
of n, such as n being odd or even, only these 
restricted values should be used in deriving the 
individual coefficients an and bn.
	
5.	The first step in Fourier analysis is to ascertain 
if the function possesses any type of symmetry. 
If the function has a nonzero average, this aver-
age should be removed to see if the function 
becomes odd or half-wave or quarter-wave 
symmetric.

of harmonics. Observe that with the ninth harmonic, 
the waveform begins to look like a square wave. Note, 
however, that no matter how many harmonics you add 
(necessarily a finite number), there always remains a 
small overshoot and some damped oscillations follow-

Objective and Overview
Power calculations are generally straightforward but 
tedious because they involve complex voltages and cur-
rents. They are considerably facilitated by utilizing the 
concept of complex power. The real part of complex 
power is real, or average, power, whereas its imaginary 
part is the reactive power associated with energy storage 
elements. The usefulness of complex power stems from its 
conservation, which implies that real and reactive power 
can be summed branch by branch in any given circuit.
Energy storage elements alternately store energy 
and return this energy to the supply. The reactance 
of energy storage elements places added current and 
voltage burdens on the power system, which neces-
sitates sometimes adding capacitors that counteract 
the normally inductive reactances of power systems. 
Another important practical consideration is when a 
source inherently has a relatively large source imped-
ance. It is of interest in such cases to determine the load 
impedance that results in maximum power transfer to 
the load.
The chapter begins by discussing instantaneous 
power in resistors, inductors, and capacitors, followed 
by the more general case of a circuit that is a combina-
tion of these elements. This serves to define real power 
and reactive power and explain their nature. Complex 
power is then defined, its conservation justified in detail, 
and its usefulness in circuit analysis illustrated in power 
factor correction that counteracts the inductive reactive 
power in a circuit.
The rest of the chapter addresses the problem of maxi-
mum power transfer, first in the case of purely resistive 
circuits, followed by the more general case in terms of 
impedances and admittances of a source and a load. The 
conditions of maximum power transfer from a source to 
a load are examined, first without constraints and then 
subject to some constraints that may be encountered 
under certain conditions.
17.1  Instantaneous and Real Power
17.1.1  Resistor

tor R (Figure 17.1a). The current through the resistor is

as shown in Figure 17.1b. The instantaneous power varies 
at twice the supply frequency because power is propor-
tional to the square of v or i, so that the variation of power 
with time is the same during the positive half-cycles of v 
and i as during the negative half-cycles. p is never nega-
tive, since the resistor does not return power to the supply. 
If p is averaged over a full period, 2π/ω, the cosine term 
averages to zero, so that the average of p over a period is

Equation 17.2 agrees with what was derived in 
Section 8.3. P is referred to as the real, or average, power. 
It represents electric energy that is converted to another 
form of energy, which in this case is heat if R represents 
a heating element. In general, real power could represent 
conversion to another form of energy, if R, for example, rep-
resents a lamp. The expression “real power” will be used 
in this chapter rather than “average power” to emphasize 
that real power is the real part of complex power.

It is seen that P is both the magnitude of the real power 
and the amplitude of the alternating component of the 
instantaneous power of frequency 2ω rad/s. According to 
Equation 17.3, the maximum value of p is 2P.

Ans. (a) 50 W; (b) 50 W, 200π rad/s.
17.1.2  Inductor
If the voltage v(t) = Vmcos(ωt + θ) is applied across an 
inductor L (Figure 17.2a), the current through the induc-
tor is i(t)  =  Imcos(ωt  +  θ − 90°)  =  Imsin(ωt  +  θ), where 
Im  =  Vm/ωL (Section 8.3). The instantaneous power

as shown in Figure 17.2b. When p is positive, the 
inductor actually absorbs power and stores it as 
energy in the magnetic field. When p is negative, the 
inductor delivers power, thereby returning the stored 
energy to the source. The real power is zero, so that 
as much power flows in one direction as in the oppo-
site direction and no power is dissipated. p varies at 
twice the supply frequency because it is the product 
of v and i, so that p is positive when v and i are both 
positive or both negative, and p is negative otherwise.

QL is referred to as the reactive power in the case of 
an inductor. It is the amplitude of the power that is 
alternately absorbed in the inductor and returned to 
the  supply. In this sense, reactive power is confined 
to the electric circuit and is not available outside the 
circuit. Because of its different nature, the unit of Q 
is not a watt but a volt-ampere reactive, abbreviated 
as VAR.
17.1.3  Capacitor
Similarly, if the voltage v(t) = Vmcos(ωt + θ) is applied 
across a capacitor C (Figure 17.3a), the current through 
the capacitor is i(t) = Imcos(ωt + θ + 90°) = −Imsin(ωt + θ),

capacitor delivers power, thereby returning the stored 
energy to the source. The real power is zero, so that as 
much power flows in one direction as in the opposite 
direction and no power is dissipated. p varies at twice 
the supply frequency, as explained for the case of an 
inductor.

17.1.4  General Case
We will now generalize the preceding discussion to 
a circuit that consists of resistors as well as inductors 
and capacitors, in the sinusoidal steady state. Let v be 
the voltage applied to the terminals of such a circuit 
‘N’, and let i be the current entering these terminals in 
the direction of the voltage drop v (Figure 17.4a). The 
instantaneous power delivered to the circuit is
	
p
vi
=
	
(17.10)
In general, the power p is partly dissipated in the resis-
tors of the circuit and partly stored in the energy storage 
elements. If v(t) = Vmcos(ωt + θv) and i(t) = Imcos(ωt + θi)

as shown in Figure 17.4b. If the circuit is inductive, 
θv > θi, that is, the current lags the voltage, as assumed 
in Figure 17.4, for the sake of illustration. On the other 
hand, if the circuit is capacitive, θi > θv, that is, the cur-
rent leads the voltage. Since the circuit contains, in gen-
eral, both resistors and energy storage elements, p has 
a nonzero average, because of power dissipation in the 
resistors, and p is negative over part of the cycle because 
of the power returned to the supply by the energy stor-
age elements, as in Figures 17.2 and 17.3.
Figure 17.4c illustrates the phasor diagram for v and 
i as phasors: V = Vm∠θv and I = Im∠θi, with θv > θi, as 
assumed. Let us resolve V into two components: a com-
ponent VP that is in phase with I and a component VQ 
that is in phase quadrature with I. The magnitude of VP 
is Vm, the magnitude of V multiplied by cos(θv − θi), and 
its phase angle is θi, the same as that of I. In the time

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Since vP is the component of voltage that is in phase 
with i, pP represents the instantaneous power dissipated 
in the resistances in the circuit. If pP is averaged over 
a full period, the cos2(ωt  +  θi) term averages to zero, 
leaving the average of pP as the constant term (VmIm/2) 
cos(θv − θi). This is the real power P in the general case, 
so that Equation 17.14 can then be written as

It is seen that Equation 17.15 is of the same form as 
Equation 17.3 and that when the circuit ‘N’ is purely 
resistive, θv = θI, and P in Equation 17.16 reduces to 
P in Equation 17.2. On the other hand, θv − θI = +90° 
for a purely inductive circuit and θv − θI = −90° for a 
purely capacitive circuit. In either case, P  =  0, since 
no power is dissipated in a purely reactive circuit. 
It follows that the general expression for real power 
is given by Equation 17.16 and involves cos(θv − θI), 
which accounts for the component of voltage that is in 
phase with the current.

17.18 reduces to Equation 17.9. For a purely resistive 
circuit, θv  =  θI, so Q  =  0, since a resistive circuit does 
not store electric or magnetic energy. It is seen that the 
general expression for Q is given by Equation 17.18 and 
involves sin(θv − θI), which accounts for the component 
of voltage that is in phase quadrature with the current. 
Again, Q is positive for an inductive reactance (θv > θI) 
and is negative for a capacitive reactance (θv < θI).
The preceding results can be summarized as follows:
Summary: When v is the voltage across the terminals of a 
circuit consisting of resistors, inductors, and capacitors and 
i is the current entering these terminals in the direction of a 
voltage drop v, the instantaneous power p = vi is pulsating 
at a frequency that is twice that of v and i. The real power 
dissipated in the resistors is P, the average of the product of i 
and the component of v that is in phase with I; P = VrmsIrms 
cos(θv − θi), where P is also the amplitude of the alternating 
component of the product of i and the component of v that is 
in phase with i. The reactive power, representing the energy 
that is alternately stored in the energy storage elements and 
returned to the rest of the circuit, is the product of i and the 
component of v that is in phase quadrature with i. The reac-
tive power is purely alternating, is of zero ­average, and has 
an amplitude of Q = VrmsIrmssin(θv − θi). When the circuit 
is inductive, θv  >  θI, so Q is positive. When the circuit is 
­capacitive, θv < θI, so Q is negative.
From conservation of power, the power input at every 
instant is the algebraic sum of the power dissipated in 
the resistances and the power stored as energy in energy 
storage elements at that instant. In other words,
	
p

P
Q
=

(17.19)
This is illustrated in Figure 17.5, where pP has an aver-
age P and an alternating component Pcos2(ωt  +  θi). 
pQ is purely alternating and of amplitude Q and leads 
the alternating component of pP by 90°, assuming the 
circuit is inductive. At any instant of time t1, p is the alge-
braic sum of pP and pQ.
If both sides of Equation 17.19 are divided by i,

(17.20)
In other words, at any instant of time, v is the alge-

phasor sum of VP and VQ (Figure 17.4c).

where θi  =  30° − tan−1(4/3)  =  −23.13° (Figure 17.6b). 
In the time domain, i(t) = 2cos(1000t − 23.13°) A, and 
vR(t) = Ri = 60cos(1000t − 23.13°) V, where vR(t) is the 
component of v in phase with i (vP in Equation 17.12). 
vL(t) = Ldi/dt = −80sin(1000t − 23.13°) V, = 80cos(1000t − 
23.3° + 90°) V and is the component of v that leads i by 
90° (vQ in Equation 17.13). Note that v = vR + vL (Exercise 
17.7). As phasors, VR = 60∠θi V and VL = 80∠(θi + 90°) V, 
so that VR + VR = V, as in Figure 17.6b.
It should be carefully noted that the real power dissi-
pated in the resistor is, from Equation 17.2, P = VRrms × 
Irms = (60 × 2)/2 = 60 W in terms of the voltage across the 
resistor and current through it. But in terms of the voltage 
and current at the terminals of the circuit, P = Vrms × Irms 
cos(θv − θi), where (θv − θi)  =  tan−1(4/3), so that 
cos(θv − θi) = 3/5 and P = (100 × 2/2) × (3/5) = 60 W, 
as it should be. The instantaneous power dissipated in 
the resistor is, from Equation 17.15: 60[1  +  cos2(ωt − 
23.13°), the maximum instantaneous power dissipation 
being 120 W.
From Equation 17.18, and in terms of the voltage and 
­current at the terminals of the circuit, Q = VrmsIrms sin(θv − θi) = 
(100 × 2/2) × (4/5) = 80 VAR, where sin(θv − θi) = 4/5, 
since tan(θv − θi) = 4/3. In terms of the current and volt-
age across the inductor, Q  =  VLrmsIrms  =  (80  ×  2/2)  =

P and Q are the amplitudes of purely alternating quan-

respectively (Equations 17.15 and 17.18). Since these 
components are sinusoidal functions of time having the 
same frequency 2ω, they can be represented as phasors 
on an Argand diagram. As real power, P is drawn with 
zero phase angle, along the real axis, and Q is drawn 
with a phase angle of 90°, for an inductive reactance

monly referred to as such and are not drawn on the

they have twice the frequency.

Equation 17.23 is necessary in order to have the phase 
angle of S equal to (θv − θi). Note that it is usually more 
convenient in power calculations to express magnitudes 
of voltages and currents as rms values.
Having defined complex power and expressed it in 
terms of voltage and current in Equation 17.23, the next 
step is to express complex power in terms of current 
and impedance. To do so, it is convenient to consider a 
circuit ‘N’ consisting of resistors, capacitors, and induc-
tors. Let the input impedance Z looking into the termi-
nals of the circuit be represented as a series combination 
of resistance R and reactance X (Figure 17.8a), so that 
Z = R + jX. Let Vrms =

rms q  be the input current

triangle, the scaling factor being Irms
2 . Moreover, Vrms = 
VR + VX = RIrms + jXIrms, where VR = RIrms is the com-
ponent of Vrms in phase with Irms and VX = jXIrms is the 
component of Vrms in phase quadrature with Irms.
Complex power can equally well be expressed in 
terms of voltage and admittance, rather than current and 
impedance. To do so, we consider the input admittance

17.2.2  Conservation of Complex Power
We will argue in this subsection that complex power is 
conserved because its real and imaginary parts, P and 
Q, are each conserved in any given circuit. Before doing 
so, let us clarify what exactly is meant by conserva-
tion of power in a circuit. Recall from the discussion in 
Chapters 1 and 2 that conservation of power in a circuit 
under dc conditions means that the power delivered by 
sources in the circuit is equal to the power dissipated in 
the resistors in the circuit at every instant. This power is 
real power.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The circuit of Figure 17.8 is illustrated in Figure 17.13 
in the time domain, where the reactance X is repre-
sented by an inductance L for the purpose of illustration. 
Conservation of power means that at every instant, the 
power delivered by the source is equal to that absorbed 
by the load, so that power is conserved in the circuit as a 
whole at every instant. Since instantaneous power in the 
sinusoidal steady state is given by Equation 17.19, we 
can express conservation of power at every instant as
	
p

(17.30)
The LHS in Equation 17.30 is the instantaneous power 
delivered by the source, and the RHS is the instan-
taneous power absorbed by the load, both in accor-
dance with Equation 17.19. The question is whether (1) 
Equation 17.30 necessitates that pPS = pPL and pQS = pQL 
or (2) that pPS can be different from pPL and pQS different 
from pQL as long as Equation 17.30 is satisfied. In the lat-
ter case, suppose that, for the sake of argument, pPS > pPL 
and pQS < pQL. This means that more real power pPS is 
supplied by the source than is absorbed by the load and 
that the load converts some of this real power to reac-
tive power pQL so as to satisfy Equation 17.30. However, 
this is physically impossible, because real and reactive 
powers are very different in nature. Real power is power 
expended in a load, such as that dissipated in a resis-
tor, whereas reactive power is power associated with 
the magnetic energy stored in inductors and the electric 
energy stored in capacitors. Real power is useful power 
that can be converted to other forms of energy, such as 
heat, light, and mechanical energy, and that is available 
outside the circuit. Reactive power is power that flows 
back and forth between the source and energy storage 
elements, with zero average, and is not available outside 
the circuit. It must be concluded, therefore, that in satis-
fying Equation 17.30, the real powers pPS and pPL must be 
equal and the reactive powers pQS and pQL must be equal. 
Mathematically, if the averages of both sides of Equation 
17.30 are taken over a period, then

Since the averages of the reactive powers pQS and pQL 
are zero, the averages of pPS and pPL are equal. But the 
average of real power is also the amplitude of its alter-
nating component (Equation 17.15). This means that if 
the averages of pPS and pPL are equal, then pPS = pPL, and 
in turn pQS = pQL.
The same conclusion can be reached in the frequency 
domain, with some additional inferences. Consider that 
VSRC rms is applied as in Figure 17.14a to a resistance R1 
alone. The load absorbs a real power P1 = |VSRC|2/R1, 
and the source delivers an equal real power PS1  =  P1. 
Suppose an inductance L is added in parallel with R1 
(Figure 17.14b). P1 does not change because it depends 
on |VSRC|, which has not changed. The inductor absorbs 
a reactive power QL  =  −BL|VSRC|2  =  |VSRC|2/ωL. 
The source must supply a reactive power QSL  =  QL,

VSRC = R2IS + Vab. P1 and QL do not change, since Vab 
has not changed, but the load connected to the source 
now absorbs an additional real power P2 = |IS|2R2. The 
source must therefore supply an additional real power 
PS2 = P2, in accordance with conservation of power at 
every instant. Equation 17.32 now becomes

P1, QL, and P2 do not change, since Vab and IS have not

The source must deliver an additional reactive power

where PS = PS1 + PS2 = P1 + P2, and QS = QSL + QSC = QL + QC.
According to Equation 17.34, real power P and reac-
tive power Q are conserved, as in Equation 17.30 in the 
time domain. In addition, the preceding argument illus-
trates a very useful feature of complex power analysis, 
namely, that P and Q can each be added branch by 
branch across the circuit. Thus, as one proceeds from 
right to left in Figure 17.14d, P1 of R1 is added to QL of 
the inductor, to P2 of R2, and to QC of the capacitor to 
obtain the complex power absorbed by these elements. 
By conservation of power, this is also the power deliv-
ered by the source.
Since P and Q are separately conserved in any given 
circuit, their complex sum, S = P + jQ, must also be con-
served. In summary,
Summary: In any circuit in the sinusoidal steady state, reac-
tive power is conserved in the circuit as a whole, because each 
energy storage element alternately absorbs and returns to the 
supply the same energy during each half period of the supply. 
Real power is conserved in the circuit as a whole, because it is 
an average power, and the average of reactive power is zero, so 
that the sources in the circuit must supply this average power. 
With each of  P and Q conserved, their sum S is conserved.
Concept: Real and reactive powers can each be summed branch 
by branch in a given circuit. The total sum of each, over all 
branches of the circuit, including sources, is zero, in accordance 
with conservation of real and reactive powers.
Note that in summing real and reactive powers, real 
power and inductive, reactive power are considered 
positive if absorbed by any given passive circuit ele-
ment or subcircuit, whereas capacitive, reactive power 
is considered negative if absorbed. As always, power 
delivered is the negative of power absorbed.
Example 17.2:  Application of Complex Power
Two loads ‘L1’ and ‘L2’ are connected across a 1000 0
Ð °V rms 
supply (Figure 17.15a). ‘L1’ absorbs real power of 40 kW 
and reactive, inductive power of 30 kVAR, whereas ‘L2’ 
absorbs real power of 80  kW and reactive, inductive 
power of 60 kVAR. The loads are fed through a power line 
having a resistance of 0.1 Ω and a reactance of 0.5 Ω. It is 
required to determine the voltage VSRC.
Solution:
The real powers of ‘L1’ and ‘L2’ are added together 
to give 120  kW, and their reactive powers are added 
together to give 90 kVAR lagging, that is, inductive. The 
complex power triangle at terminals ‘ab’ is shown in 
Figure 17.15b. Thus, S

The real power delivered by the source is 122.25 kW. 
It is the sum of the real power dissipated in the line 
resistance and in loads ‘L1’ and ‘L2’. The reactive power 
delivered by the source is 101.25 kVAR. It is also the sum 
of the inductive reactive power in the line reactance and 
in the two loads. Real and reactive power are conserved in 
the system as a whole.

17.3  Power Factor Correction
Concept: Reactive power, although it averages to zero over 
a cycle, generally increases the voltage and current require-
ments of a load.
A series reactance increases the voltage needed for 
delivering a required real power to a load. This is seen 
in Figure 17.8a, where the real power delivered to the 
load is P
RI
=
rms
2 . In the presence of a series reactance X, 
a larger voltage across the series combination is required 
for a given Irms and hence a given P. Similarly, a par-
allel reactance increases the current needed for deliv-
ering a required real power to a load. In Figure 17.9a, 
the real power delivered to the load is P
GV
=
rms
2 . In the 
presence of the susceptance B, a larger current through 
the parallel combination is required for a given Irms and 
hence a given P. In the presence of both series and paral-
lel reactive elements, as is generally the case with real-
life loads, both a larger voltage and a larger current are 
required for delivering a given real power to the load. 
This places an additional burden on the power system 
supplying the load. A larger current requires a greater 
current-carrying capacity of the supply conductors, and 
a larger voltage requires a higher degree of insulation of 
these conductors.
The contribution of the reactive elements relative to 
the resistive, or power-consuming, elements is indi-
cated by the phase angle (θv − θi), where cos(θv − θi) is 
the power factor (abbreviated p.f.) and sin(θv − θi) is the 
reactive  factor. For a purely resistive load, the p.f. is 
unity. Since the p.f. is the same for a positive (θv − θi) 
as for a negative (θv − θi), these two cases are distin-
guished by adding the attribute “lagging” or “lead-
ing,” respectively. For example, for a purely inductive 
load, θv − θi = 90°, and the p.f. is zero lagging, whereas 
for a purely capacitive load, θv − θi = −90°, and the p.f. 
is zero leading. In practice, ac loads generally have a 
lagging p.f., mainly due to ac motors as well as the 
inductances associated with transformers and ballasts 
of fluorescent lights. The p.f. may be as low as 0.8 lag-
ging or less, particularly during motor starting. A low 
p.f. is undesirable because of the additional current and 
voltage burdens placed on the supply, as explained pre-
viously. In the case of large loads, the additional costs 
involved can be quite considerable, so that some mea-
sures are taken to improve the p.f.. This power factor 
correction is achieved by adding capacitive reactance 
to counteract the inductive reactance of the load. The 
reactive power due to inductance is positive, whereas 
the reactive power due to capacitance is negative. By 
adding the proper value of capacitance, the net reactive 
power can be reduced to zero, thereby achieving a unity 
power factor.
Example 17.3:  Power Factor Correction
Assuming a supply frequency of 50 Hz, determine the 
capacitance that must be added in parallel with the 
loads of Figure 17.15 of Example 17.2 so as to make 
the p.f. unity at the load terminals ‘ab’. Determine the 
effect of this capacitance on the supply current and 
voltage.
Solution:
The reactive power at terminals ‘ab’ was found in 
Example 17.2 to be 90 kVAR. The reactive power of the 
added capacitor must be −90 kVAR. The value of capac-
itance is determined using Equation 17.29, Q
BV

where Q = −90 kVAR, B = 2πfC, and Vrms = 1000 V. This 
gives C = 286.5 μF.

, the apparent power |S| at 
any location is determined by measuring Vrms  and Irms  at 
that location by means of an ac voltmeter and an ac amme-
ter, respectively. To measure the real power, a wattmeter 
is used. The wattmeter has two coils, a current coil and a 
voltage coil with ± polarity markings. The current coil is 
connected like an ammeter, so that the load current flows 
through it. The voltage coil is connected across the load 
terminals, like a voltmeter. When the polarities of the two 
coils with respect to I and V are as indicated in Figure 
17.17, the wattmeter reads the power absorbed, P = VrmsI
rmscos(θv − θi). If the polarity of either coil is reversed, the 
wattmeter gives a negative indication. Knowing P and 
|S|, Q and the p.f. readily follow from the complex power 
triangle. Ideally, the voltage coil draws no current and the 
­voltage across the current coil is zero.
Primal Exercise 17.16
In Example 17.2, a wattmeter is used to measure the 
total real power delivered to the combined load. If the 
voltage terminal of the wattmeter is connected through 
a 20:1 voltage step-down transformer, and the current 
coil is connected through a 10:1 current step-down 
transformer, with normal polarities maintained, deter-
mine the wattmeter reading. If the voltage and current 
at the load terminals are measured to be 1000 V and 
150 A, respectively, determine the power factor of the

17.4  Maximum Power Transfer
A matter of practical importance is to transfer maximum 
power to a load from a given source of specified open-
circuit voltage and source impedance, under steady-
state conditions. Before considering the general case, we 
will start with the purely resistive case.

Figure 17.19 shows the source characteristic and load line,

sented by the area of the rectangle OAQB. This area 
is a maximum when Equation 17.36 is satisfied. Any 
other load such as ¢
RL or ¢¢
RL results in a rectangle of 
smaller area.
Figure 17.20 illustrates the various power relations in 
the circuit under conditions of maximum power trans-
fer. The source characteristic and load line are the same 
as in Figure 17.19, and the power delivered to the load 
is the area of the rectangle OAQB, as in Figure 17.19.

It should be emphasized that the condition of maxi-

stant and Rsrc is varied, the results are quite different. It 
is seen from Figure 17.20 that if RL is kept equal to RLm, 
the load line OE remains the same. If Rsrc is reduced to

IL = VSRC/RLm, and the power transferred is V
R
SRC

2 /
, cor-
responding to the area of the rectangle OCEG. Hence, 
given a source having a specified open-circuit voltage 
VSRC, maximum power is transferred to the load when 
Rsrc = 0.
When the source has a small internal resistance, the 
condition for maximum power transfer is generally 
not of practical interest. For example, in the case of 
a 12  V battery having a source resistance of 0.04 Ω, 
maximum power transfer occurs when the load is 
unrealistically small at 0.04 Ω. The battery current 
under these conditions is 12/0.08 = 150 A, which will 
most likely damage the battery. The normal battery 
load is much larger than 0.04 Ω. On the other hand, 
consider a transistor ­amplifier having an output resis-
tance of 100 Ω and required to drive a loudspeaker of 
nominal resistance  8  Ω. Maximum  power transfer is 
of ­practical interest in this case and is usually imple-
mented in practice using an audio transformer.

Primal Exercise 17.17
Consider a load connected to a source having an open-
circuit voltage of 12 V and a source resistance of 50 Ω. 
Determine (a) the load resistance for maximum power 
transfer, (b) the power delivered to the load, and (c) the 
power dissipated in the source resistance.
Ans. (a) 50 Ω, (b) 0.72 W; (c) 0.72 W.
Example 17.4:  Maximum Power 
Transfer in Resistive Circuit
It is required to determine the value of RL that should 
be connected between terminals ‘ab’ in Figure 17.21a for 
maximum power transfer.
Solution:
We need only determine RTh looking into terminals ‘ab’. 
RLm for maximum power transfer is then equal to RTh. To 
determine RTh, we apply a test source VT between termi-
nals ‘ab’ with the 4 V source set to zero, and determine 
IT (Figure 17.21b). It is seen that I

Simulation: We can determine RTh using dc sweep as 
was done in Example 4.1. Instead we will demonstrate 
PSpice’s parametric sweep feature that allows des-
ignating the value of a circuit component as a global 
parameter, which can then be varied continuously 
or for some discrete values. The circuit is entered as 
shown in Figure 17.22, with a power probe added to 
R3. To use parametric sweep with R3, double click on 
the default resistance value displayed, which invokes 
the Display Properties window. In the Value field, enter 
a chosen designation enclosed in curly brackets, which 
tells PSpice that this is a parameter. In the present 
example, {R_val} is entered. The next step is to declare 
{R_val} a global parameter. Place the part PARAM from 
the SPECIAL library; this shows on the schematic as 
PARAMETERS: When this word is double-clicked, the 
Property Editor spreadsheet is displayed. Click on the 
New Column button to display the Add New Column 
dialog box. Enter R_val in the Name field and any 
value, say 1k, in the Value field. A new column R_val is 
added to the spreadsheet with the entry 1k. To have this 
displayed on the schematic, click on the Display button 
and choose Name and Value in the Display Properties 
dialog box. R_val = 1k appears under PARAMETERS, 
as shown in Figure 17.22.
To run the simulation, select DC Sweep in the 
Simulation Settings dialog box. Under Sweep vari-
able, choose Global parameter and enter R_val for 
‘Parameter name’. Under Sweep type choose Linear and 
enter 50 k for ‘Start value’, 250 k for ‘End value’, and 
100 for ‘Increment’. It may be necessary to try different 
ranges of values of R_val before identifying the range 
that shows a maximum. When PSpice is run, the plot 
of Figure 17.23 is displayed. Click on the cursor button 
and select Trace/Cursor/Max. The cursor reading gives 
125.000K, 200.000. Thus, RLmax = 125 kΩ, and the maxi-
mum power transferred is 200 W. If the power probe is 
not used, the plot of Figure 17.23 is displayed by adding 
the trace W[R3] to the schematic page.
It should be noted that parametric sweep can also be 
implemented under ac conditions using the source VAC 
instead of VDC and AC Sweep instead of DC Sweep.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 When only the condition for maximum power 
transferred is required, without the value of this 
power, it is only necessary to determine RTh, or 
ZTh, or YN, as the case may be, without determin-
ing VTh.

The condition for maximum power transfer will be 
generalized next to the case of source or load imped-
ances under steady-state sinusoidal conditions. Let VSRC 
and Zsrc = Rsrc + jXsrc represent, in general, TEC as seen 
from terminals ‘ab’ of a given circuit connected to a load 
ZL  =  RL  +  jXL (Figure 17.24). The current phasor IL is

We wish to determine the condition that maximizes 
PL, assuming that Vsrc, Rsrc, and Xsrc are fixed, whereas RL

PL is maximum for XL given by

With this condition satisfied, Equation 17.38 reduces 
to Equation 17.35. PL is maximum when Equation 17.36 
is satisfied, that is, RLm = Rsrc. Combining this condition 
with that of Equation 17.39 gives the condition for maxi-
mum power transfer as

opposite in sign to Xsrc, so that the two reactances cancel 
out. With the additional condition that RLm = Rsrc, maxi-
mum power is transferred to RL.
What would be the condition for maximum power 
transfer if RL and XL can again be varied independently, 
but their range of variation is restricted, so that Equation 
17.40 cannot be satisfied? It is clear from Equation 17.38 
that under these conditions, with RL fixed, PL is maximum 
when (Xsrc + XL) is as small as possible. With (Xsrc + XL) 
considered constant, the condition for maximum power 
transfer can be determined by deriving dPL/dRL from 
Equation 17.38 and setting it to zero. This gives

If RL cannot be made equal to this value, then a value of RL 
as close to it as possible will give maximum power transfer.

of a transformer with ZL. The load impedance

The effect of an ideal transformer is to vary ZL  by the

Example 17.5:  Maximum Power Transfer 
in Terms of Impedances
Given the circuit of Figure 17.29, it is required to deter-
mine the condition for maximum power transfer, and the 
power transferred to RL, under the following conditions:
	
1.	Both RL and XL are variable independently.
	
2.	RL is fixed at 35 Ω and XL is variable.
	
3.	XL is fixed at −50 Ω and RL is variable.
	
4.	RL is fixed at 35 Ω, XL is fixed at −50 Ω, and the 
­transformer can be selected to have any desired 
turns ratio.
Solution:
The first step is to derive TEC looking into terminals ‘ab’ 
toward the source and reflect TEC to the secondary side.

and the frequency as ω = 1 krad/s (f = 159.155 Hz). The 
source inductance is 10 mH to give a reactance of 10 Ω. 
Under conditions of maximum power transfer, as deter-
mined in (a), the reactance of the load is 20 Ω in paral-
lel with −10 Ω, which gives a load reactance of −20 Ω, 
corresponding to a capacitance of 50  μF at 1 krad/s. 
Note that the load impedance is a resistance of 20 Ω 
in parallel with a capacitive reactance of 20 Ω, which 
gives a phase angle of θv − θi = −45°, the current lead-
ing the voltage by 45°. The simulation is run using Time 
Domain (Transient) analysis, with a ‘Run to time’ of 
20 m, a ‘Start saving data after’ of 10 m, to allow for the 
initial transient to die down, and a ‘Maximum step size’ 
of 1u. The instantaneous power delivered to the load 
is displayed by selecting Trace/Add trace and entering 
V(vo)*I(L1), since the current through the inductor is 
the same as that through the R2-C1 load. The real and 
reactive powers are displayed by entering V(vo)*I(R2) 
and V(vo)*I(C1), respectively. The power plots appear 
in Figure 17.37.

Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 When v is the instantaneous voltage across the 
terminals of a circuit consisting of resistors, 
inductors, and capacitors and i is the instanta-
neous current entering these terminals in the 
direction of a voltage drop v, the instantaneous 
power absorbed is p = vi and is pulsating at a 
frequency that is twice that of v and i. The real 
power dissipated in the resistors is P = VrmsIrms × 
cos(θv − θi), where P is also the amplitude of the 
alternating component of the product of i and 
the component of v that is in phase with i. The 
reactive power, representing the energy that is 
alternately stored in the energy storage elements 
and returned to the rest of the circuit is the prod-
uct of i and the component of v that is in phase 
quadrature with i. The reactive power is purely 
alternating, of zero average, and has an ampli-
tude of Q = VrmsIrmssin(θv − θi). When the circuit 
is inductive, θv > θI, so Q is positive. When the 
circuit is capacitive, θv < θI, so Q is negative.

Q: S = P + Q. It is = V

•	 In any circuit in the sinusoidal steady state, reac-
tive power is conserved in the circuit as a whole, 
because each energy storage element alternately 
absorbs and returns the same energy during 
each half period of the supply. Real power is 
conserved in the circuit as a whole, because it 
is an average power, and the average of reactive 
power is zero, so that the sources in the circuit 
must supply this average power. With P and Q 
conserved, their phasor sum S is conserved.
•	 Real, reactive, and complex powers can each be 
summed branch by branch in a given circuit, 
with the total sum of each, over all branches of 
the circuit, equal to zero.
	
1.	 In summing real and reactive powers, real 
power and inductive, reactive power are 
considered positive if absorbed by any 
given passive circuit element or subcircuit,

whereas capacitive, reactive power is con-
sidered negative if absorbed. Power deliv-
ered is the negative of power absorbed.
•	 Reactive power, although it averages to zero 
over a cycle, generally increases the voltage and 
current requirements of a load.
•	 cos(θv − θi) is known as the power factor (p.f.). 
It is the cosine of the angle between imped-
ance and resistance in the impedance triangle, 
or between complex power and real power in 
the complex power triangle. The p.f. is unity for 
a pure resistance, is zero lagging for a purely 
inductive reactance, and is zero leading for a 
purely capacitive reactance.
•	 The p.f. can be brought to unity by adding 
capacitance to counteract the normally induc-
tive reactance of the load.
•	 If a source of open-circuit voltage VSRC and 
source resistance Rsrc is connected to a load RL, 
maximum power is transferred from the source 
to the load when RLm  =  Rsrc. The maximum 
power transferred is (VSRC)2/4RLm.
•	 If a source of open-circuit voltage VSRC and 
source impedance Zsrc is connected to a load 
ZL  =  RL  +  j XL and RL and XL can be varied 
independently without restriction, maximum 
power is transferred from the source to the load 
when Z

(
) . If |ZL| can be varied, as 
when a transformer is used, maximum power 
is transferred when |ZLm| = |Zsrc|. Similar rela-
tions apply if admittances are used instead of 
impedances.
	
1.	 Similar relations apply for admittances, 
where resistance is replaced by con-
ductance and reactance is replaced by 
susceptance.

Objective and Overview
The present chapter is concerned with responses to step 
and impulse inputs, which are the most basic exam-
ples of “sudden changes” applied to circuits. Impulse 
responses are fundamental to signals and systems anal-
ysis, including convolution and the Laplace transform, 
to be discussed in subsequent chapters.
The impulse response is introduced as a limiting case 
of a pulse response of a capacitor, after which the fun-
damental attributes of an impulse are presented. This 
is followed by a discussion of the step and impulse 
responses of single capacitors and series and parallel 
combinations of a capacitor and a resistor. The same 
procedure is applied to the step and impulse responses 
of single inductors and series and parallel combina-
tions of an inductor and a resistor. These cases are 
used to illustrate some important concepts concerning 
the responses of capacitors and inductors to sudden 
changes.
The chapter ends with a generalization of the concepts 
presented to circuits consisting of capacitors, inductors, 
and resistors.
18.1  Capacitor Response to Current Pulse
Consider a step current ISRC applied at t = 0 to a capacitor 
that is initially uncharged, as illustrated in Figure 18.1a. 
The current step implies that iSRC  =  0 for t  <  0, and 
iSRC = ISRC, for t > 0, so that the source current suddenly 
changes at t = 0 from 0 to ISRC. The voltage v across the 
capacitor is

(18.1)
The voltage across the capacitor increases linearly 
with time at a rate ISRC/C as shown in Figure 18.1a.
Suppose a current pulse of amplitude ISRC that starts at 
t = 0 and ends at t
a
=  is applied to the uncharged capaci-
tor (Figure 18.1b). Initially, for t < a, the current pulse 
is indistinguishable from the current step of the same 
amplitude, which causes the voltage across the capaci-
tor to increase linearly at the same rate ISRC/C as before. 
At t
a
= , v = aISRC/C, since the charge delivered to the 
capacitor from t = 0 to t = a is aISRC, the area under the 
current pulse. The voltage is 1/C times this charge, that

is, aISRC/C. Just after t = a, the pulse ends, so that iSRC 
becomes zero, and the ideal current source acts as an 
open circuit. Since the capacitor is assumed ideal, the 
charge is maintained for t > a, and v remains at its value 
of aISRC/C at t = a.
Let the amplitude of the pulse be increased to ISRC
¢
 
and its duration reduced to a′ (Figure 18.1b), while 
keeping the area of the pulse the same, that is, a ISRC

. The change in v is steeper, 
but the final value of v remains the same because the 
charge transferred is the same. Thus, from Equation 18.1, 
the final value of v is a I

 but is reached 
at a faster rate.
The question arises as to what shape of pulse will 
cause a step or instantaneous change in voltage across 
the capacitor, from 0 to aISRC/C at t = 0 (Figure 18.2). 
This means that a′ → 0, so that the pulse width becomes 
infinitesimal. But if the current pulse is of infinitesi-
mal width, yet must deliver the same finite amount of 
charge aISRC or ¢ ¢
a ISRC, then the pulse amplitude must 
tend to infinity so as to have a finite area. In other words, 
i = Cdv/dt → ∞ at t = 0, since dv/dt, the slope of the step 
function in Figure 18.2, is infinite at t = 0. We can also 
consider the pulses in Figure 18.1b to be of duration aΔ 
and height ISRC/Δ, so that the pulse area is aISRC, inde-
pendently of Δ. In the case of the pulse of width a and 
height ISRC, Δ = 1, whereas in the case of the pulse of 
width a′ and height ISRC

, Δ = a′/a.
If we now let Δ → 0, the current pulse of Figure 18.3 
becomes of infinitesimal width and of infinite height, 
as required to produce a step change in the voltage 
across the capacitor at t  =  0 in Figure 18.2. The area 
or charge remains aISRC so that the amplitude of the 
voltage step across the capacitor is aISRC/C. The pulse 
now becomes an impulse function or a Dirac delta 
function. Qualitatively, such a function is a pulse of 
infinitesimal duration and infinite amplitude but hav-
ing a finite area or strength, which is aISRC in this case. 
The impulse function will be considered in more detail 
in the ­following section.
Primal Exercise 18.1
Determine the capacitor voltage as a function of time if a 
current of 5 mA is applied for 10 ms to a 10 μF, uncharged 
capacitor.
Ans. v rises to 5 V at 10 ms and remains at this value 
thereafter.
18.2  The Impulse Function
The impulse function is of fundamental importance in 
the theory of signals and systems, as will become appar-
ent from future discussions. Mathematically, the impulse 
function is not a function in the ordinary sense but is a 
singular, generalized function that has some rather pecu-
liar properties. Because the amplitude of the impulse 
goes to infinity, care must be exercised in dealing with 
infinities. Mathematically, this is avoided, where nec-
essary, by considering the finite area of the impulse, 
instead of its infinite amplitude, as will be illustrated in 
future discussions.
A unit impulse function at the origin is denoted by 
d t( ) and is formally defined such that

(18.2)
According to Equation 18.2, the area or strength of 
δ(t) is unity; hence, its designation as a unit impulse. 
Moreover, δ(t) is zero everywhere except at t = 0.
Figure 18.4 helps provide a “feel” for δ(t) to clarify its 
variation with respect to time and its relation to another 
important function, namely, the unit step function at 
the origin, u(t). In this figure, the interval between t = 0− 
and t = 0+ is greatly expanded, where t = 0− is the time 
just less than 0, and t = 0+ is the time just greater than 0 
(Figure 18.4). The following should be noted concern-
ing δ(t):
	
1.	δ(t) = 0, for t ≤ 0− and δ(t) = 0, for t ≥ 0+, so that 
δ(t) ≠ 0 only in the interval between t = 0− and 
t = 0+. In words, δ(t) is zero for t less than or equal

to 0− and is also zero for t greater than or equal to 
0+, bearing in mind that t  =  0− and t  =  0+ are 
infinitesimally separated. In other words, δ(t) 
is concentrated at t = 0. This is not as alien a 
concept as may appear at first sight, for it is cus-
tomary to consider charge or mass to be concen-
trated at a point. This means that a finite charge 
or mass extends over an infinitesimal distance 
only. The mass/unit distance or charge/unit 
distance is therefore an impulse at the point 
where the mass or charge is located. What is 
being considered here is an extension of this 
concept to voltages or currents that occur at a 
“point” in time.
	
2.	The time integral of δ(t) is the unit step func-
tion u(t) (Figure 18.4b), also known as the 
Heaviside step function. From Equation 18.2 
and Figure 18.4,

	 where the lower limit has been changed from 
−∞ to 0−, without changing the value of the 
integral, because, by definition (Equation 18.1), 
δ(t) = 0 between t = −∞ and t = 0−, so that no 
area is enclosed in this interval. Extending the

the unit impulse, so that the value of the inte-
gral becomes unity, again by definition of the

t in Equation 18.4 can be extended to +∞, as 
in Equation 18.2, without changing the value of 
the integral, because δ(t) = 0 between t = 0+ and 
t = ∞, so that no additional area is included in 
this interval. Equations 18.3 and 18.4 define u(t), 
the unit step function at the origin as

In other words, u(0−)  =  0, and u(0+)  =  1. 
Equations 18.3 and 18.4 involving two values 
of the integral of δ(t), one for t ≤ 0− and one for 
t ≥ 0+ can be combined into a single expression 
using the definition of u(t) from Equation 18.5:

u(t) changes from 0 to 1 between t = 0− and 
t  =  0+, as illustrated in Figure 18.4b. Since 
t = 0− and t = 0+ are infinitesimally separated, 
u(t) is, strictly speaking, undefined at t  =  0, 
where it changes “instantaneously” from 0 to 1. 
However, u(t) can be interpreted as having a 
value of 1/2 at t = 0 (Problem P18.49). This is 
reminiscent of the Fourier series expansion for a 
periodic function having a step discontinuity, in 
which case, the FSE gives the average value of 
the function at the two ends of the discontinuity 
(Example 16.1).

respect to time,

(18.7)
	
	 This makes sense intuitively, as the derivative of 
u(t) would be zero, for t ≤ 0− and for t ≥ 0+, where 
u(t) does not change with time and would tend 
to infinity at t  =  0 where u(t) changes instan-
taneously. Note that, strictly speaking, when 
a function is discontinuous at a certain value 
of time, as is u(t) at t = 0, the derivative at this 
instant is not defined, because it tends to infinity, 
and infinity is not precisely defined. However, 
δ(t) is a special type of infinity, of infinitesimal 
duration. Equations 18.6 and 18.7 define the 
relation between δ(t), the unit impulse at the 
origin and u(t), the unit step at the origin.
In order to avoid any possible confusion, 
it should be carefully noted that at t = 0−, δ(t) 
has not yet occurred, and u(t) is still zero. At t = 0+, 
δ(t) is over, and u(t) = 1. In other words, δ(t) and

the change in u(t) are both confined to between 
t = 0− and t = 0+.
Conventionally, and in terms of t = 0, rather

It should be noted, however, that this defini-
tion can lead to ambiguities and inconsistencies 
in some cases (Problem P18.49). In analyzing 
circuits involving a sudden change, such as step 
or impulse inputs, or switching operations, it is 
more advantageous and much clearer to con-
sider the state of the circuit just before and just 
after the sudden change, that is, at t = 0− and 
t = 0+ for a sudden change at t = 0. The definition 
of u(t) according to Equations 18.5 through 18.7 
is much better suited for such cases and is used 
exclusively in this book.
	
4.	As implied in Figure 18.4a, δ(t) is an even func-
tion of time, that is, δ(t) = δ(−t). This can be ­easily 
proved using the defining integral (Equation 18.2) 
and substituting t = −t′ in δ(t), in dt, and in the 
integration limits. The integral becomes

	 The negative sign of dt′ in the integrand in 
the second integral from the left is removed 
by interchanging the limits of integration. t′ is 
replaced by t in the last integral, because, in a 
definite integral, the limits are defined, so that 
the integration variable is a dummy variable 
that can be designated by any symbol, without 
changing the value of the integral.
	
5.	For consistency in all the relations involving 
δ(t) and u(t), particularly those of the Laplace 
transform and its properties (Chapter 21), u(t) 
is considered dimensionless, so that δ(t) has the 
dimensions of t−1, that is, per unit time. This is 
consistent with Equation 18.4 and means that 
the integral in Equation 18.2 is dimensionless.
	
6.	It follows that a current impulse can be 
expressed as qδ(t) A, where q is the strength, or 
area, of the current impulse. Since this area is 
in ampere-second, or coulombs, it represents 
charge. With δ(t) having the dimensions of 
t−1, time cancels out, so that the unit of qδ(t) 
is the ampere. Similarly, a voltage impulse can 
be expressed as λδ(t) V, where λ is the strength 
or area of the voltage impulse. Since this area 
is in volt-second, or weber-turn, it represents 
flux linkage. With δ(t) having the dimen-
sions of t−1, time cancels out, so that the unit 
of λδ(t) is the volt. Unless otherwise speci-
fied, impulses will be denoted as Kδ(t), with K 
interpreted as appropriate for the case under 
consideration.
	
7.	δ(t – a) is a unit impulse δ(t) that is delayed by 
a, so it occurs at t = a, between t = a− and t = a+, 
as illustrated in Figure 18.5a. Equation 18.3

Solution:
Figure 18.6 illustrates a unit impulse δ(t – a) at t = a and a 
function f(t) that is continuous at t = a. Continuity of f(t) 
at t = a implies that f(a−) = f(a) = f(a+). It may be argued, 
at first sight, that multiplying the infinite δ(t  –  a) by 
a finite value of f(t) is still infinity. The impulse func-
tion, however, is a special type of infinity that is of 
infinitesimal duration. The proper procedure is to con-
sider, first, the integral of the product f(t)δ(t – a), then 
apply the definition of the impulse and the condition 
of continuity of f(t) at t = a. The integral of the product 
f(t)δ(t – a) can be expanded as

Because the function is continuous at t = a, f(t) in the 
interval between t = a− and t = a+ is f(a). This is a constant 
and can be taken outside the integral. From the defini-
tion of the impulse at t = a, the integral of δ(t – a) between 
t = a− and t = a+ is unity. Thus,

If f(a) = 0, then it must not be inferred from Equation 
18.18 that multiplying zero by infinity is indeterminate. 
If f(a) = 0, the RHS of Equation 18.17 is zero. Differen­
tiating both sides of this equation gives f(t)δ(t – a) = 0 
if f(a) = 0. Again, this emphasizes that in dealing with 
impulses, the finite area of the impulse should be 
invoked wherever necessary to obtain mathematically 
correct results. Intuitively, it seems reasonable that since 
the impulse δ(t – a) occurs at the point t = a, multiply-
ing δ(t – a) by f(a) multiplies the strength of the impulse 
by f(a).
Because multiplying f(t) by δ(t – a) returns the value 
f(a), the impulse is said to sample the function at t = a. 
Note that if f(t) has a step discontinuity at t = a, the value 
sampled is the mean of f(a−) and f(a+) (Problem P18.49).

18.3  Responses of Capacitive Circuits

18.3.1  Single Capacitor
The fact that the v–i relation for a capacitor involves 
differentiation or integration with respect to time 
underlies an important characteristic of the capacitor. 
Consider the v–i relation of a capacitor to be rearranged 
as dv = (1/C)idt. Integrating this relation between two 
limits t1 and t2 gives

, that is, t2 – t1 = Δt → 0. We will consider the 
current integral on the RHS of Equation 18.20 as an area, 
assuming first that i is finite and continuous at t = t1, as 
illustrated in Figure 18.7a. For small Δt, the area under 
the curve from t = t1 to t = t2 is that of a trapezoid of 
width Δt and a finite mean height. This area tends to 
zero as Δt → 0, so that v(t2) = v(t1).
If i is finite and has a finite discontinuity at t = t1 (Figure 
18.7b), then the mean height of the trapezoid of width Δt 
is finite, so that the area of the trapezoid tends to zero as 
Δt → 0. Again, Equation 18.20 gives v(t2) = v(t1).
It is seen that as long as i is finite and continuous at 
t = t1, or is finite and has a finite discontinuity at t = t1, 
the integral on the RHS of Equation 18.20 tends to zero 
as Δt → 0, which makes v(t2) = v(t1). In other words, the 
capacitor voltage does not change instantaneously due 
to a finite change in capacitor current.
On the other hand, if a current impulse i = qδ(t – t1) 
occurs at t = t1, then

This underlies an important concept,
Concept: The voltage across a capacitor cannot be changed 
instantaneously except by a current impulse, which 
­deposits on the capacitor a charge equal to the strength of 
the impulse.
A current impulse of qδ(t) A has a strength or area 
of q coulombs. When such an impulse flows through 
a capacitor of C farads, it deposits q coulombs on the 
capacitor instantaneously, between t  =  0− and t  =  0+, 
which changes the voltage across the capacitor instanta-
neously by q/C V. Physically, an instantaneous change in 
the charge or voltage of a capacitor is an instantaneous 
change in the stored energy. As emphasized in earlier 
chapters, stored energy cannot be changed instanta-
neously by any finite “force” or any physically realiz-
able means. This does not contradict the effect of the 
impulse because the infinite amplitude of the impulse 
and its infinitesimal duration are not physically realiz-
able. The impulse, after all, is a mathematical construct 
that is, nevertheless, extremely useful for theoretical 
purposes in that it readily leads to important conclu-
sions and concepts concerning the behavior of linear 
systems, including circuits. Practically, an impulse can 
be approximated by a pulse whose area is equal to that 
of the impulse, and whose duration is small compared 
to the shortest response time of the system, as will be 
illustrated by PSpice simulations.
It should be carefully noted that whereas the voltage 
across a capacitor cannot be changed instantaneously 
except by a current impulse, the current through a capacitor

can change instantaneously, even in the absence of any 
impulse. This is because the energy stored in the capaci-
tor is not directly related to current, but to charge or 
voltage.
The responses of a capacitor to current or voltage steps 
or impulses can be readily derived from the v–i relation 
of a capacitor. These responses, illustrated in Figure 18.8, 
are discussed in what follows, assuming the capacitor is 
initially uncharged. Any initial charge on the capacitor 
can, in principle, be added to these responses algebra-
ically, as appropriate and in accordance with superposi-
tion. Units of v, i, R, and C are not explicitly specified but 
are assumed to be consistent.

The integral of the step function between 0− and 0+ is 
zero. Although u(t) = 1 at t = 0+, the area involved in the 
integration is 1 × (0+ − 0−) = 1 × Δt = 0 as Δt → 0. The inte-
gral of u(t) for t ≥ 0+ is the ramp function t. The response 
is shown in Figure 18.8a. v(t) is continuous at t = 0, that 
is, v(0−) = 0 and v(0+) = 0, because the change in i is finite, 
as was argued in connection with Figure 18.7b. But the 
slope of v(t) is discontinuous at t = 0.

. As explained previ-
ously, the current impulse changes the capacitor voltage 
­instantaneously from zero to K/C. The voltage response 
will therefore be (K/C)u(t) (Figure 18.8b). Note  that 
since an impulse function is the time derivative of 
the step ­function (Equation 18.8), the current input of 
­Figure 18.8b is the time derivative of that of Figure 18.8a. 
Because the voltage–current relation for a capacitor is 
linear, the voltage response of Figure 18.8b is also the 
time derivative of that of Figure 18.8a.

rent impulse on the capacitor, so that the voltage across 
the capacitor changes instantaneously from 0 at t = 0− to 
K at t = 0+, as required by the step function.

 where δ(1)(t) is the derivative of 
the unit impulse (­Figure 18.8d). When the applied 
voltage is an impulse the voltage first increases 
toward infinity and eventually returns to zero at 
t = 0+. By this time, there is no charge on the capacitor. 
The ­derivative of the impulse is biphasic: it increases 
in the positive direction on the rising phase of the 
impulse, then goes negative in mirror fashion on the 
negative phase of the impulse. The positive part  of 
the δ(1)(t) current deposits charge on the capacitor, 
and the negative part removes this charge, so that by 
t = 0+, the voltage is zero, and there is no net charge on 
the capacitor, in accordance with v being zero at t = 0+. 
Because of its biphasic nature δ(1)(t) is also known as 
the unit doublet.

This argument will be invoked on many occa-

of the water vessel invoked in Section 11.1. Consider 
a water tap emptying into a vessel, where water flow 
from the tap is analogous to current and the volume of 
water in the ­vessel is analogous to charge. If the water 
tap is suddenly turned on at t = 0, causing a finite flow 
of water into the vessel, then at t = 0+, water has not 
yet accumulated in the vessel. In other words, the time 
integral of water flow, from t = 0−, just before the tap 
is turned on, and t = 0+, just after the tap is turned on, 
is zero.

It is seen from Equation 18.24 that the integral of y 
between t = 0− and t = 0+ is zero, so that the impulse is 
not affected.
18.3.2  RC Circuit
There are two basic circuits to consider: (1) a series RC 
circuit excited by a voltage step or impulse and (2) a 
parallel RC circuit excited by a current step or impulse. 
When a series RC circuit is excited by an ideal current 
source, including a current step or impulse source, the 
resistor is redundant as far as the capacitor voltage 
is concerned, because the capacitor current is deter-
mined by the ideal current source, independently of the 
­resistor. The capacitor voltage will then be as in Figure 
18.8a or b. Similarly, when a parallel RC circuit is excited 
by an ideal voltage source, including a voltage step or 
impulse source, the resistor is redundant as far as the 
capacitor current is concerned, because the capacitor 
voltage is determined by the ideal voltage source, inde-
pendently of the resistor. The capacitor current will then 
be as in Figure 18.8c or d.
The responses of interest are summarized in 
Figure 18.9. These responses can be derived from the 
generalized response of first-order circuits, as given 
by Equation 11.57, based on the initial and final val-
ues of the voltage or current and the time constant. 
The final value can be readily determined from steady-
state conditions. The resistance seen by the capacitor 
is Thevenin’s resistance, which is R. Hence, τ = RC in 
all cases. It remains, therefore, to specify the initial 
value of voltage or current at t = 0+, just after the sud-
den change due to the step or impulse. It is assumed as 
in Figure 18.8 that the capacitor is initially uncharged. 
Physical interpretation of circuit behavior will be 
emphasized throughout.
Case 1: vSRC(t) = Ku(t) (Figure 18.9a)
At t  =  0−, both i and v are zero, by assumption. 
The  energy stored in the capacitor is zero at t  =  0−. 
The capacitor voltage is not forced to change at t = 0, for, 
according to KVL, Ku(t) = Ri + v. When u(t) changes at 
t = 0, i can change so as to satisfy KVL, with v remain-
ing zero, as required by the constancy of stored energy. 
Hence, v(0+) = 0. In other words, the uncharged capacitor 
acts as a short circuit during the interval t = 0− to t = 0+, in 
response to the voltage step. This means that i(0+) = K/R 
in order to satisfy KVL at t = 0+. As t → ∞, the capacitor 
is fully charged, so that i(∞) = 0 and v(∞) = K. With the 
initial values i(0+) and v(0+) determined, as well as the 
final values, it follows from Equation 11.57 that

The time variations of i(t) and v(t) are illustrated in 
Figure 18.9a.
Case 2: vSRC(t) = Kδ(t) (Figure 18.9b)
During the rising phase of the impulse, the impulse 
appears like a step of large magnitude. It would be 
expected, therefore, that the uncharged capacitor would 
initially act as a short circuit, as in Case 1. If the capacitor 
acts as a short circuit, the voltage impulse appears across 
R, resulting in a current impulse i = Kδ(t)/R. The current 
impulse flowing through the capacitor deposits a charge 
K/R on the capacitor at t = 0+, so that v(0+) = K/RC. This 
means that, unlike a true short circuit, v(0+) ≠ 0. The fact

that v increases from 0 to K/RC during the impulse 
does not invalidate the argument that a full voltage 
impulse appears across R, as argued in connection with 
Equation 18.24, when a finite quantity is added to, or 
subtracted from, an impulse.
At t = 0+, when the impulse is over, the ideal voltage 
source acts as a short circuit, and the circuit reduces to 
a capacitor that is charged to K/RC and having a resis-
tor R across it. The capacitor begins to discharge, thereby 
reversing the direction of i. The initial value of i at t = 0+ is 
−K/R2C. This can also be determined from KVL, which is

At t = 0+, v(0+) = K/RC, and the impulse is over, so 
that the RHS of Equation 18.26 is zero. This gives 
i(0+) = −v(0+)/​R = −K/R2C.
As t → ∞, both v and i tend to zero. It follows from the

The time variations of i(t) and v(t) are illustrated in 
Figure 18.9b.
Case 3: iSRC(t) = Ku(t) (Figure 18.9c)
The responses in this case can be derived from those 
of Case 1 by transforming the Ku(t) voltage source in 
series with R to a Ku(t)/R current source in parallel 
with R. Multiplying i and v of Figure 18.9a by R gives 
the required responses as illustrated in Figure 18.9c. 
Nevertheless, it is instructive to derive these responses 
from first principles.
At t = 0−, both i and v are zero, by assumption, and 
the energy stored in the capacitor is zero. The capaci-
tor voltage is not forced to change at t = 0, for, accord-
ing to KCL, Ku(t) = v/R + i. When u(t) changes at t = 0, 
i can change so as to satisfy KCL, with v remaining zero, 
as required by the constancy of stored energy. Hence, 
v(0+) = 0. The uncharged capacitor acts as a short circuit 
during the interval t = 0− to t = 0+, in response to the 
current step. This means that i(0+) = K in order to satisfy 
KCL at t = 0+.
As t  →  ∞, the capacitor is fully charged, so that 
i(∞) = 0 and v(∞) = KR. Using Equation 11.57,

Case 4: iSRC = Kδ(t) (Figure 18.9d)
The responses in this case can be derived from those 
of Case 2 by ­transforming the Kδ(t) voltage source in 
series with R to a Kδ(t)/R current source in parallel 
with R. Multiplying i and v of Figure 18.9b by R gives 
the response in this case, as ­illustrated in Figure 18.9d. 
Nevertheless, it is instructive to derive these responses 
from first principles.
During the rising phase of the impulse, the impulse 
appears like a step of large magnitude. It would be 
expected, therefore, that the capacitor would initially 
act as a short circuit. This means that the applied current 
impulse flows through the capacitor, thereby deposit-
ing a charge K on the capacitor and increasing v to K/C 
at t = 0+. Although the capacitor acts initially as a short 
circuit in response to the current impulse, the capacitor 
voltage at the end of the impulse is finite, unlike that of 
a true short circuit. As v increases from 0 to K/C at t = 0+ 
during the impulse, the current in R increases from 0 to 
K/RC at t = 0+. This does not invalidate the argument 
that a full current impulse flows through the capacitor, as 
argued in connection with Equation 18.24, when a finite 
quantity is added to, or subtracted from, an impulse.
At t = 0+, when the impulse is over, the ideal current 
source acts as an open circuit and the circuit reduces to 
a capacitor that is charged to K/C and having a resistor 
R across it. The capacitor begins to discharge, thereby 
reversing the direction of i. The initial value of i at t = 0+ is 
−K/RC. This can also be determined from KCL, which is

18.3.3  Summary of Responses of Capacitive Circuits
The responses discussed in this section can be summa-
rized by the following important concepts:
	
1.	The voltage across a capacitor does not change 
instantaneously unless it is forced to change in order 
to satisfy KVL. On the other hand, the capacitor cur-
rent can change instantaneously in order to satisfy 
KVL and KCL.
	
2.	If the voltage across a capacitor is forced to change 
instantaneously, this change is accomplished by a 
current impulse through the capacitor.

556	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
In Figure 18.8c, the capacitor voltage is 
forced to change instantaneously to become 
equal to K, in accordance with KVL, the capaci-
tor current being an impulse KCδ(t). In Figure 
18.9a and c the capacitor voltage is not forced 
to change instantaneously by the applied 
­excitation. The capacitor ­current jumps instan-
taneously to satisfy  KVL in Figure  18.9a and 
KCL in Figure 18.9c.
	
3.	When a voltage or current step is applied to an 
RC circuit, and the capacitor voltage is not forced 
to change, an uncharged capacitor acts as a short 
circuit at the time the step is applied. Since the volt-
age of an uncharged capacitor is zero before the step 
is applied, it will remain zero at just after the step, 
because the stored energy does not change instanta-
neously. As for a short circuit, the capacitor voltage 
is zero but the capacitor current can have any finite 
value.
In Figure 18.9a, the capacitor acts as a short 
circuit in response to the voltage step, so that 
at t = 0+, v = 0 and i = K/R. Similarly in Figure 
18.9c, the capacitor acts as a short circuit in 
response to the current step, so that at t = 0+, 
v = 0 and the source current K passes through 
the capacitor.
	
4.	If in the preceding case the capacitor is initially 
charged, the capacitor voltage does not change just 
after the step, because the stored energy does not 
change instantaneously if no current impulse flows 
through the capacitor. Superposition can be applied 
to determine the currents and voltages in the rest 
of the circuit, but it is generally easier to determine 
these values by replacing the charged capacitors by 
batteries of equal voltage, in accordance with the 
substitution theorem.
	
5.	When a voltage or current impulse is applied to 
an RC circuit, an uncharged capacitor initially 
acts as a short circuit in response to the impulse, 
which determines the path followed by the current 
impulse, or where in the circuit the voltage impulse 
appears. Just after the impulse, the capacitor voltage 
is not zero, as in a short circuit, but is equal to the 
charge deposited by the current impulse divided by 
the capacitance.
The justification is that the rising phase of 
an impulse is indistinguishable to begin with 
from a step of large amplitude. The capacitor 
will therefore initially act as a short circuit. But 
if a current impulse flows through the capaci-
tor, then the capacitor voltage at t = 0+ is not 
zero, as in the case of a short circuit, but is 
the charge deposited by the impulse divided 
by the capacitance. Thus, in Figure 18.9d, the 
capacitor acts initially as a short circuit, so 
that the current impulse flows through the 
capacitor, depositing a charge K coulombs 
and producing a capacitor voltage K/C at 
t = 0+. In Figure 18.9b, the capacitor acts ini-
tially as a short circuit, so that the voltage 
impulse appears across R and results in a cur-
rent impulse (K/R)δ(t) through the capacitor. 
The  current impulse deposits a  charge K/R, 
the resulting voltage being K/RC.
	
6.	If in the preceding case the capacitor is initially 
charged, superposition can be applied. The capaci-
tor is first considered uncharged, and the preceding 
concepts applied. The charge or voltage due to ini-
tially stored energy is then added algebraically to the 
charge or voltage due to the impulse.
It should be kept in mind that the current and volt-
age values at t = 0+ are the initial values for determining 
­current and voltage as functions of time by solving the 
differential equation involved.
Example 18.2:  Responses of a Capacitive 
Circuit to Voltage Step and Impulse
Given the circuit of Figure 18.10, (a) determine v1(0+), 
v2(0+), i1(0+), and i2(0+) assuming vSRC(t) = 2u(t) V and 
the capacitors to be initially uncharged. (b)  Repeat 
(a) assuming initial voltages of the capacitors at t = 0 
of V10 = 4 V and V20 = 6 V, and determine how KVL 
and KCL are satisfied at t = 0+. (c) Repeat (a) assum-
ing vSRC (t)  =  4δ(t) mV. (d) Repeat (b) assuming 
vSRC(t) = 4δ(t) mV.

voltages remain the same, at t = 0− and at t = 0+, irrespec-
tive of the initial charges on the capacitors.
	 (a)	 When the step is applied, the capacitors act as short 
circuits (Figure 18.11a). It follows that v1(0+)  =  0 
and v2(0+) = 0. Moreover, i1(0+) = 2 V/2 kΩ = 1 mA. 
Since v2(0+) = 0 the current in the 1 kΩ is zero, so 
that i2(0+) = i1(0+) = 1 mA.
	 (b)	 As argued in connection with Equation 18.31, 
v1 and v2 are not forced to change at t = 0. Hence, 
v1(0+) = V10 = 4 V and v2(0+) = V20 = 6 V. At t = 0+, the 
circuit becomes as shown in Figure 18.11b, where 
vSRC = 2 V and the capacitors have been replaced 
by ideal dc voltage sources in accordance with 
the substitution theorem (Section 4.4). It follows 
from Equation 18.31 that 2i1(0+) + 4 + 6 = 2, which 
gives i1(0+) = −4 mA. The current in the 1 kΩ resis-
tor is 6 mA in the direction shown, so that i2(0+) = 
− (6 + 4) = −10 mA in order to satisfy KCL. Note that 
superposition can also be applied, considering the 
capacitors to be initially uncharged, and then add-
ing to i1(0+) and i2(0+) the components due to the ini-
tial voltages acting alone. However, it is simpler in 
this case to apply KVL to the circuit of Figure 18.11b. 
It should be kept in mind that replacing the 1 and 
2  μF capacitors by batteries of 4 and 6  V, respec-
tively, applies at t = 0+ only, and at no other time.
	 (c)	 When the impulse is applied, the capacitors 
­initially act as short circuits as in Figure 18.11a. 
The voltage impulse will therefore appear across 
the 2 kΩ resistor and cause a current impulse of 
4δ(t) mV/2 kΩ  =  2δ(t) μA through both capaci-
tors. The current impulse deposits a charge of 
2 μC on the plate of the 1 μF capacitor connected 
to the 2 kΩ resistor and removes 2 μC from the 
plate of the 2 μF capacitor connected to the nega-
tive source terminal. This leaves each of the two 
capacitors with 2 μC, so that v1(0+)  =  2  V and 
v2(0+) = 1 V (Figure 18.12a). At t = 0+, the impulse is 
over and the voltage source acts as a short circuit; 
KVL around the outer loop gives i1(0+) = −1.5 mA. 
With 1 mA flowing in the 1 kΩ resistor, KCL gives 
i2(0+) = −2.5 mA.
	 (d)	 When the capacitors are initially charged, the cur-
rent impulse can be considered first to deposit 2 μC 
on uncharged capacitors. This charge adds to the 
charges already present. The total charge on the 1 μF 
capacitor is 4 + 2 = 6 μC, which gives v1(0+) = 6 V, 
whereas the total charge on the 2 μF capacitor is 
12 + 2 = 14 μC, and v2(0+) = 7 V (Figure 18.12b). 
It follows from KVL around  the  outer loop that 
i1(0+) = −6.5 mA. With 7 mA flowing in the 1 kΩ 
resistor, KCL gives i2(0+) = −13.5 mA.
Simulation: The circuit for simulation of the voltage 
step is shown in Figure 18.13a. PSpice applies VDC at 
the start of the simulation like a voltage step. Initial 
voltages across the capacitors are assumed as given.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Applying time domain analysis, cursor readings give 
v1(0+) = 4.0000 V and v2(0+) = 6.000 V. To read the currents 
using the cursor, it is necessary to remove the switch-
ing transient at t = 0. In the SCHEMATIC1 page, select 
‘Plot/Axis Settings/X-Axis/User Defined’, and enter 
1 us as the beginning of the trace, instead of zero. The 
cursors, when toggled, read I(C1) = i1(0+) = −3.9995 m 
and I(C2) = i2(0+) = −9.999 m.
To simulate the impulse, the battery is replaced by 
VPULSE with the parameters entered as shown in 
Figure 18.13b. Because the time response of the circuit is 
of the order of kilo-ohms × microfarads, or milliseconds, 
the voltage impulse is simulated by a pulse of 0.1 μs dura-
tion and 40 kV amplitude, which makes the area 4 mV as 
required. The initial values can be read using the cursor by 
selecting a user-defined time axis starting at 0.101 μs, after 
the impulse is over. The readings are v1(0+) = 5.9988 V, 
v2(0+) = 6.9990 V, i1(0+) = −6.4989 m, and i2(0+) = −13.498 m.

Responses to Step and Impulse Inputs	
559
Suppose that a voltage pulse of amplitude VSRC that 
starts at t = 0 and ends at t
a
=  is applied to the uncharged 
inductor (Figure 18.18b). Initially, for t < a, the voltage 
pulse is indistinguishable from the voltage step of the 
same amplitude, which causes the inductor current to 
increase linearly at the same rate VSRC/L as before. At 
t = a, i = aVSRC/L, since the flux linkage established in 
the inductor from t = 0 and t = a is aVSRC, the area under 
the voltage pulse. The current is 1/L times this flux link-
age, that is, aVSRC/L. Just after t = a, the pulse ends, so 
that vSRC becomes zero, and the ideal voltage source acts 
as a short circuit. Since the inductor is assumed ideal, 
the current is maintained for t > a at its value of aVSRC/L 
at t = a.

Note the similarity, because of duality, between 
Figures  18.1 and 18.32, whereby v replaces i and L 
replaces C. As in the case of the capacitor considered in 
Section 18.1, if the width of the voltage pulse becomes 
infinitesimally small, while the area of the pulse remains 
at aVSRC, then the voltage amplitude becomes infinitely 
large, resulting in a voltage impulse of strength aVSRC 
Vs. The resulting change in current becomes a step 
function, so that the current changes from 0 to aVSRC/L 
instantaneously at t = 0.
Primal Exercise 18.8
Determine the inductor current as a function of time if a 
voltage of 5 mV is applied for 10 ms to a 10 μH inductor.
Ans. i rises to 5 A at 10 ms and remains at this value 
thereafter 0.5.

the integral on the RHS of Equation 18.34 tends to zero 
as t2 → t1, which makes i(t2) = i(t1). In other words, the

This underlies an important concept,
Concept: The current through an inductor cannot be 
changed instantaneously except by a voltage impulse, which 
establishes in the inductor a flux linkage equal to the strength 
of the impulse.
A voltage impulse of λδ(t) V has a strength or area 
of λ Wb-T. When such an impulse is applied across 
an inductor of L henries, it establishes a flux link-
age λ Wb-T in the inductor instantaneously, between 
t  =  0− and t  =  0+, which changes the inductor cur-
rent instantaneously by λ/L A. Physically, an instan-
taneous change in the flux linkage or current of an 
inductor is an instantaneous change in the stored 
energy. As argued previously, stored energy cannot 
be changed instantaneously by any finite ‘force’. But 
a voltage impulse of infinite amplitude and infini-
tesimal ­duration can change the energy stored in the 
­inductor  ­instantaneously, and hence the inductor 
current.
Whereas the current through an inductor cannot be 
changed instantaneously except by a voltage impulse, 
the voltage across an inductor can change instantaneously, 
even in the absence of any impulse. This is because the 
energy stored in the inductor is not directly related to 
voltage, but to flux linkage or current.
The responses of an inductor to current or voltage 
steps or impulses can be readily derived from the v–i 
relation of an inductor, as illustrated in Figure 18.19, 
assuming the inductor is initially uncharged. Any ini-
tial current in the inductor can, in principle, be added 
algebraically to these responses, as appropriate and 
in accordance with superposition. Units of v, i, R, and 
L are not explicitly specified but are assumed to be 
consistent.

changes the inductor current instantaneously from

response of Figure 18.19b is also the time derivative of

­current is zero, and there is no net flux linkage in the 
inductor, in accordance with i being zero at t = 0+.

Responses to Step and Impulse Inputs	
561
RL circuit excited by a current step or impulse. When a 
series RL circuit is excited by an ideal current source, 
such as a current step or impulse source, the resistor is 
redundant as far as the inductor voltage is concerned, 
because the inductor current is determined by the ideal 
current source, independently of the resistor. The induc-
tor voltage will then be as in Figure 18.19c or d. Similarly, 
when a parallel RL circuit is excited by an ideal voltage 
source, including a voltage step or impulse source, the 
resistor is redundant as far the inductor current is con-
cerned, because the inductor voltage is determined by 
the ideal voltage source, independently of the resistor. 
The inductor current will then be as in Figure 18.19a or b.
The responses of interest are summarized in 
Figure 18.20. These responses can be derived from the 
generalized response of first-order circuits, as given by 
Equation 11.57, based on the initial and final values of the 
voltage or current and the time constant. The final value 
can be readily determined from steady-state conditions. 
The resistance seen by the inductor is Thevenin’s resis-
tance, which is R. Hence, τ = L/R in all cases. It remains, 
therefore, to specify the initial value of voltage or cur-
rent at t = 0+, just after the sudden change due to the 
step or impulse. It is assumed as in Figure 18.19 that the 
inductor is initially uncharged. The physical interpreta-
tion of circuit behavior will be emphasized throughout.
Case 1: iSRC = Ku(t) (Figure 18.20a)
At t  =  0−, both i and v are zero, by assumption. The 
energy stored in the inductor is zero at t = 0−. The induc-
tor current is not forced to change at t = 0, for, accord-
ing to KCL, Ku(t) = v/R + i. When u(t) changes at t = 0, 
v can change to satisfy KCL, with i remaining zero, as 
required by constancy of stored energy. Hence, i(0+) = 0. 
In other words, the uncharged inductor acts as an open cir-
cuit during the interval t = 0− to t = 0+, in response to the 
current step. The applied current step flows through R at 
t = 0−, which means that v jumps from 0 at t = 0− to KR 
at t = 0+ in order to satisfy KVL. As t → ∞, the inductor 
acts as a short circuit and all the source current passes 
through the inductor, so that v(∞) = 0 and i(∞) = K. With 
the ­initial and final values of i(0+) and v(0+) determined, 
it follows from ­Equation 11.57 that

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
expected, therefore, that the inductor would act as an 
open circuit. In this case, the current impulse flows 
through R, resulting in a voltage impulse v  =  KRδ(t). 
The voltage impulse establishes a flux linkage KR in 
the inductor at t = 0+, so that i(0+) = KR/L. This means 
that, unlike a true open circuit, i(0+) ≠ 0. The fact that i 
increases from 0 to KR/L during the impulse does not 
invalidate the argument that the full current impulse 
flows through R, as argued in connection with Equation 
18.24, when a finite quantity is added to, or subtracted 
from, an impulse.
At t = 0+, when the impulse is over, the ideal current 
source acts as an open circuit and the circuit reduces 
to an inductor having an initial current of KR/L and a 
resistor R across it. The inductor begins to discharge, 
with a reversal of the polarity of v. The initial value of 
v at t = 0+ is −KR2/L. This can also be determined from 
KCL, which is

that the RHS of Equation 18.37 is zero. This gives 
v(0+) = –Ri(0+) = −KR2/L.
As t → ∞, both v and i tend to zero. It follows from the

Case 3: vSRC(t) = Ku(t) (Figure 18.20c)
The responses in this case can be derived from those of 
Case 1 by transforming the Ku(t) current source in par-
allel with R to a KRu(t) voltage source in series with R. 
Dividing i and v of Figure 18.20a by R gives the response in 
this case, as illustrated in Figure 18.20c. Nevertheless, it is 
instructive to derive these responses from first principles.
At t = 0−, both i and v are zero, by assumption, and the 
energy stored in the inductor is zero. The inductor cur-
rent is not forced to change at t = 0, for according to KVL, 
Ku(t) = Ri + v. When u(t) changes at t = 0, v can change 
so as to satisfy KVL, with i remaining zero, as required 
by the constancy of stored energy. Hence, i(0+) = 0. The 
uncharged inductor acts as an open circuit during the 
interval t = 0− to t = 0+, in response to the voltage step. 
This means that v(0+) = K in order to satisfy KVL at t = 0+.
As t → ∞, the inductor acts as a short circuit, so that 
v(∞) = 0 and i(∞) = K/R. Using Equation 11.57,

Case 4: vSRC(t) = Kδ(t) (Figure 18.20d)
The responses in this case can be derived from those of 
Case 2 by transforming the Kδ(t) current source in par-
allel with R to a KRδ(t) voltage source in series with R. 
Dividing i and v of Figure 18.20b by R gives the response 
in this case, as illustrated in Figure 18.20d. Nevertheless, 
it is instructive to derive these responses from first 
principles.
During the rising phase of the impulse, the impulse 
appears like a step of large magnitude. It would be 
expected, therefore, that the inductor would act as an 
open circuit. This means that the applied voltage impulse 
appears across the inductor, thereby establishing a flux 
linkage K in the inductor and increasing i to K/L at t = 0+. 
Although the inductor acts initially as an open circuit in 
response to the voltage impulse, the inductor current at 
the end of the impulse is finite, unlike that of a true open 
circuit. As i increases from 0 to K/L at t = 0+ during the 
impulse, the voltage across R increases from 0 to KR/L 
at t = 0+. This does not invalidate the argument that a full 
voltage impulse appears across the inductor, as argued 
in connection with Equation 18.24, when a finite quan-
tity is added to or subtracted from an impulse.
At t = 0+, when the impulse is over, the ideal voltage 
source acts as a short circuit and the circuit reduces to 
an inductor having an initial current K/L and a resistor 
R across it. The inductor begins to discharge, thereby 
reversing the direction of v. The initial value of v at t = 0+ is 
−KR/L. This can also be determined from KCL, which is

18.5.3  Summary of Responses of Inductive Circuits
The responses discussed in this section can be summa-
rized by the following important concepts:
	
1.	The current through an inductor does not change 
instantaneously unless it is forced to change in order 
to satisfy KCL. On the other hand, the inductor 

Responses to Step and Impulse Inputs	
563
voltage can change instantaneously in order to sat-
isfy KVL and KCL.
	
2.	If the current through an inductor is forced to change 
instantaneously, this change is accomplished by a 
voltage impulse across the inductor.
In Figure 18.19c, the inductor current is forced 
to change instantaneously to become equal to K, 
in accordance with KCL, the inductor voltage 
being an impulse KLδ(t). In Figure 18.20a and 
c, the inductor current is not forced to change 
instantaneously by the applied excitation. The 
inductor voltage jumps instantaneously to satisfy 
KCL in Figure 18.20a and KVL in Figure 18.20c.
	
3.	When a voltage or current step is applied to an RL 
circuit, and the inductor current is not forced to 
change, an uncharged inductor acts as an open cir-
cuit at the time the step is applied. Since the current 
of an uncharged inductor is zero before the step is 
applied, it will remain zero just after the step, because 
the stored energy does not change instantaneously. 
As for an open circuit, the inductor current is zero 
but the inductor voltage can have any finite value.
In Figure 18.20a, the inductor acts as an open 
circuit from t  =  0− to t  =  0+, so that at t  =  0+, 
i = 0, and v = KR. Similarly in Figure 18.20c, the 
inductor acts as an open circuit from t = 0− to 
t = 0+, so that at t = 0+, i = 0, and the source volt-
age K appears across the inductor.
	
4.	If in the preceding case the inductor is initially 
charged, the inductor current does not change just 
after the step, because the stored energy does not 
change instantaneously if no voltage impulse is 
applied across the inductor. Superposition can be 
applied to determine the currents and voltages in the 
rest of the circuit, but it is generally easier to deter-
mine these values by replacing the charged inductors 
by dc sources of equal current, in accordance with the 
substitution theorem.
	
5.	When a voltage or current impulse is applied to 
an RL circuit, an uncharged inductor initially 
acts as an open circuit in response to the impulse, 
which determines where in the circuit the voltage 
impulse appears, or the path followed by the current 
impulse. Just after the impulse, the current through 
the inductor is not zero but is equal to the flux link-
age established by the voltage impulse divided by the 
inductance.
The justification is that the rising phase of an 
impulse is indistinguishable to begin with from 
a step of large amplitude. The inductor will 
therefore initially act as an open circuit. But if 
a voltage impulse appears across the inductor, 
then the inductor current at t = 0+ is not zero, as 
in the case of an open circuit, but is the flux link-
age established by the impulse divided by the 
inductance. Thus, in Figure 18.20d, the induc-
tor acts initially as an open circuit, so that the 
voltage impulse appears across the inductor, 
establishing a flux linkage K and producing an 
inductor current K/L at t = 0+. In Figure 18.20b, 
the inductor acts initially as an open circuit, so 
that the current impulse flows through R and 
results in a voltage impulse (KR)δ(t) across the 
inductor. The voltage impulse establishes a flux 
linkage KR, the resulting current being KR/L.
	
6.	If in the preceding case the inductor is initially 
charged, superposition can be applied. The induc-
tor is first considered uncharged, and the preceding 
concepts applied. The flux linkage or current due 
to ­initially stored energy is then added algebraically 
to the flux linkage or current due to the impulse.
It should be kept in mind that the current and volt-
age values at t = 0+ are the initial values for determining 
­current and voltage as functions of time by solving the 
differential equation involved.
Example 18.3:  Responses of an Inductive 
Circuit to Current Step and Impulse
Consider the circuit of Figure 18.21, which is of the form 
of the dual of Figure 18.10, but with different component 
values. (a) Assuming iSRC(t) = 2u(t) mA and the induc-
tors to be initially uncharged, determine i1(0+), i2(0+), 
v1(0+), and v2(0+). (b) Repeat (a) assuming initial currents 
in the inductors at t = 0 of I10 = 3 mA and I20 = 4 mA, 
and determine how KVL and KCL are satisfied at t = 0+. 
(c) Repeat (a) assuming iSRC(t) = 2δ(t) μA. (d) Repeat (b) 
assuming iSRC(t) = 2δ(t) μA.

change at t = 0+, because the term in v1 can change to 
satisfy KCL. The stored energy and hence the inductor 
currents remain the same, at t = 0− and at t = 0+, irrespec-
tive of the initial currents in the inductors.
	 (a)	 When the step is applied, the inductors act as open 
circuits (Figure 18.22a). It follows that i1(0+) = 0 and 
i2(0+) = 0. Moreover, v1(0+) = 2 mA × 2 kΩ = 4 V. 
Since i2(0+) = 0 the voltage across the 1 kΩ is zero, 
so that v2(0+) = v1(0+) = 4 V.
	 (b)	 As argued in connection with Equation 18.42, i1 and 
i2 are not forced to change. Hence, i1(0+) = 3 mA and 
i2(0+) = I20 = 4 mA. At t = 0+, the circuit becomes as 
shown in Figure 18.22b, where iSRC = 2 mA and the 
inductors have been replaced by ideal dc current 
sources in accordance with the substitution theo-
rem (Section 4.4). It follows from Equation 18.42 
that 2 = 3 + v1(0+)/2 + 4, which gives v1(0+) = −10 V. 
The voltage across the 1 kΩ resistor is 4 V of the 
polarity shown, so that v2(0+) = −(10 + 4) = −14 V in 
order to satisfy KVL. Note that superposition can 
also be applied, considering the inductors to be 
initially uncharged, and then adding to v1(0+) and 
v2(0+) the components due to the initial currents 
acting alone. However, it is simpler in this case to 
apply KCL to the circuit of Figure 18.22b. It should 
be kept in mind that replacing the 1 and 2 H induc-
tors by current sources of 3 and 4 A, respectively, 
applies at t = 0+ only, and at no other time.
	 (c)	 When the impulse is applied, the inductors initially 
act as open circuits, as in Figure 18.22a. The cur-
rent impulse will therefore flow through the 
2 kΩ resistor and cause a voltage impulse of 2δ(t) 
μA × 2 kΩ = 4δ(t) mV. The voltage impulse estab-
lishes a flux linkage of 4 mWb-T in both inductors. 
This produces initial currents i1(0+)  =  4  mA and 
i2(0+) = 2 mA (Figure 18.23a). At t = 0+, the impulse 
is over, and the current source acts as an open cir-
cuit. From KCL, the current in the 2 kΩ resistor is 
6 mA, and v1 = −12 V. KVL around the mesh on the 
RHS gives v2 = −14 V.
	 (d)	 When the inductors are initially charged, the 
voltage impulse still establishes a flux linkage 
of 4 mWb-T in each inductor, which adds to the 
flux linkages already present. The total flux link-
age in the 1 H inductor becomes 4 + 3 = 7 mWb-T, 
and i1(0+) = 7 mA, whereas the total flux linkage 
in the 2 H inductor becomes 4 + 8 = 12 mWb-T, 
and i2(0+) = 6 mA (Figure 18.23b). The current in 
the 2 kΩ resistor is 13 mA, and v1 = −26 V. KVL 
around the mesh on the RHS gives v2 = −32 V.
Simulation: The circuit for simulation of the cur-
rent step is shown in Figure 18.24a. PSpice applies 
IDC at the start of the simulation like a current step. 
Initial ­currents through the inductors are assumed. 
Applying time domain analysis, cursor readings give 
i1(0+) = 3.0000 mA, i2(0+) = 4.000 mA, v1(0+) = −10.0000 V, 
and v2(0+) = −14.0000 V.

18.6  Responses of RLC Circuits 
to Step and Impulse Inputs
When step or impulse inputs are applied to an RLC 
circuit, capacitors and inductors act, respectively, as 
summarized at the ends of Sections 18.3 and 18.5. This 
behavior is illustrated in Examples 18.4 and 18.5.
Example 18.4:  Responses of RLC Circuit 
to Voltage Step and Impulse
Consider the circuit of Figure 18.29, with an initial volt-
age of 2  V on the capacitor and an initial current of 
2 mA in the inductor, determine (a) i1(0+), i2(0+), v1(0+), 
and v2(0+), assuming vSRC(t)  =  9u(t) V, and verify that

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Neither v1 nor i2 are forced to change at t = 0+ 
in order to satisfy KVL or KCL because KVL can 
be satisfied by changes in i1 or v2 in Equation 
18.43, and KCL can be satisfied by changes in 
i1 in Equation 18.44. It follows that v1(0+) = 2 V, 
and i2(0+) = 2 mA. At t = 0+, the capacitor can be 
replaced by a 2 V battery and the inductor by a 
2 mA dc current source. If the current in the 1 kΩ 
resistor is denoted as v2/1 mA (Figure 18.30), then 
i1 = v2/1 + 2 mA, and KVL around the mesh on the 
LHS at t = 0+ is 9 = 2(v2/1 + 2) + 2 + v2, which gives 
v2(0+) = 1 V and i1(0+) = 3 mA. The currents and 
voltages at t = 0+ will be as shown in Figure 18.30.
	 (b)	 In the interval 0− < t < 0+, the capacitor acts as a 
short circuit and the inductor as an open circuit 
(Figure 18.31a). The 6δ(t) mV voltage impulse pro-
duces a 2δ(t) μA current impulse, which in turn 
produces a voltage impulse of 2δ(t) mV across the 
inductor. The 2δ(t) μA current impulse deposits a 
charge of 2 μC on the capacitor, which adds to the 
initial charge of 2 μC, so that the charge at t = 0+ is 
4 μC and v1(0+) = 4 V (Figure 18.31b). The voltage 
impulse establishes a flux linkage of 2 mWb-T in 
the inductor, which adds to the initial 4 mWb-T, 
so that the flux linkage at t = 0+ is 6 mWb-T and 
i2(0+) = 3 mA. i1(0+) = 3 + v2/1 mA, and KVL in the 
mesh on the LHS is 2(3 + v2/1) + 4 + v2 = 0. This 
gives v2(0+) = −10/3 V and i1(0+) = −1/3 mA, as in 
Figure 18.31b.
Simulation: The circuit for simulation of the voltage 
step is shown in Figure 18.32a. Applying time domain 
analysis, cursor readings give i1(0+)  =  3.0000  mA, 
i2(0+) = 2.000 mA, v1(0+) = 2.0000 V, and v2(0+) = 1.0000 V.
The impulse is simulated by VPULSE having the 
parameters entered as shown in Figure 18.32b. The ini-
tial values can be read using the cursor by selecting a 
user-defined time axis starting at 0.101  μs, after the 
impulse is over. The readings are i1(0+) = −333.268u, 
i2(0+) = 2.9995 m, v1(0+) = 3.9993, and v2(0+) = −3.3328.
Example 18.5:  Responses of RLC Circuit 
to Current Step and Impulse
Consider the circuit of Figure 18.33, with an initial volt-
age of 2  V on the capacitor and an initial current of 
2 mA in the inductor, determine (a) i1(0+), i2(0+), v1(0+), 
and v2(0+), assuming iSRC(t) = 6u(t) mA, and verify that 
KVL and KCL are satisfied. (b) Repeat (a) assuming

Responses to Step and Impulse Inputs

Neither i1 nor v2 are forced to change at t = 0+ 
in order to satisfy KVL or KCL, because KCL 
and KVL can be satisfied by changes in v1 or i2. 
It follows that i1(0+) = 2 mA, and v2(0+) = 2 V. At 
t = 0+, the inductor can be replaced by a 2 mA cur-
rent source and the capacitor by a 2 V battery, as 
shown in Figure  18.34a. v1(0+) and i2(0+) can be 
determined by first combining the two current 
sources into a single 4 mA current source directed 
upwards, and then transforming this source, in 
combination with the 2 kΩ resistor in parallel with 
it, to an equivalent voltage source of 8 V in series 
with a 2 kΩ resistor (Figure  18.34b). From KVL, 
8 = 3i2(0+) + 2, which gives i2(0+) = 2 mA. It follows 
that v1(0+) = 2 + 2 × 1 = 4 V.
	 (b)	 In the interval 0− < t  <  0+, the capacitor acts as 
a short circuit and the inductor as an open cir-
cuit (Figure 18.35a). The resistance of the two 
resistors in parallel is 2/3 kΩ. The 6δ(t) μA cur-
rent impulse produces a 6 × 2/3δ(t) = 4δ(t) mV 
voltage impulse, which in turn produces a cur-
rent impulse of 4/1δ(t)  =  4δ(t) μA through the 
capacitor. The 4δ(t) μA current impulse deposits a 
charge of 4 μC on the capacitor, which adds to the 
initial charge of 4 μC, so that the charge at t = 0+ is 
8 μC and v2(0+) = 4 V (Figure 18.35b). The voltage 
impulse establishes a flux linkage of 4 mWb-T in 
the inductor, which adds to the initial 2 mWb-T, 
so that the flux linkage at t = 0+ is 6 mWb-T and 
i2(0+) = 6 mA. KCL in terms of v1(0+) is i1(0+) = 6 = 
−v1(0+)/2 – [v1(0+) – 4]/1, which gives v1(0+) = 
−4/3 V and i2(0+) = −16/3 mA, as in Figure 18.35b.
Simulation: The circuit for simulation of the voltage 
step is shown in Figure 18.36a. Applying time domain 
analysis, cursor readings give i1(0+)  =  2.0000  mA, 
i2(0+) = 2.000 mA, v1(0+) = 4.0000 V, and v2(0+) = 2.0000 V.
The impulse is simulated by IPULSE with the parame-
ters entered as shown in Figure 18.36b. The initial values 
can be read using the cursor by selecting a user-defined 
time axis starting at 0.101 μs, after the impulse is over. 
The readings are i1(0+) = 5.9987 m, i2(0+) = −5.3322 m, 
v1(0+) = −1.3330, and v2(0+) = 3.9992.

1.	 The unit step function is dimensionless, 
whereas the unit impulse function has the 
units of t−1.
•	 The voltage across a capacitor cannot be changed 
instantaneously except by a current impulse, 
which deposits on the capacitor a charge equal 
to the strength of the impulse.
•	 The current through an inductor cannot be 
changed instantaneously except by a volt-
age impulse, which establishes in the induc-
tor a flux linkage equal to the strength of the 
impulse.
•	 The voltage across a capacitor does not change 
instantaneously unless it is forced to change in 
order to satisfy KVL. On the other hand, the 
capacitor current can change instantaneously in 
order to satisfy KVL and KCL.
•	 The current through an inductor does not 
change instantaneously unless it is forced to 
change in order to satisfy KCL. On the other 
hand, the inductor voltage can change instanta-
neously in order to satisfy KVL and KCL.
•	 When a voltage or current step is applied to 
an RC circuit, an uncharged capacitor acts as 
a short circuit at the time the step is applied. 
Since the voltage of an uncharged capacitor is 
zero before the step is applied, it will remain 
zero at just after the step, because the stored 
energy does not change instantaneously. As for 
a short circuit, the capacitor voltage is zero but 
the capacitor current can have any finite value.

tially charged, the capacitor voltage does

stored energy does not change instanta-
neously if no current impulse flows through 
the capacitor. Superposition can be applied 
to determine the currents and voltages in 
the rest of the circuit, but it is generally eas-
ier to determine these values by replacing 
the charged capacitors by batteries of equal 
voltage, in accordance with the substitution 
theorem.
•	 When a voltage or current step is applied to 
an RL circuit, an uncharged inductor acts as an 
open circuit at the time the step is applied. Since 
the current of an uncharged inductor is zero 
before the step is applied, it will remain zero 
just after the step. As for an open circuit, the 
inductor current is zero but the inductor volt-
age can have any finite value.
	
1.	 If in the preceding case the inductor is ini-
tially charged, the inductor current does not 
change just after the step, because the stored 
energy does not change instantaneously 
if no voltage impulse is applied across the 
inductor. Superposition can be applied to 
determine the currents and voltages in the 
rest of the circuit, but it is generally easier 
to determine these values by replacing the 
charged inductors by dc sources of equal 
current, in accordance with the substitution 
theorem.
•	 When a voltage or current impulse is applied 
to an RC circuit, an uncharged capacitor ini-
tially acts as a short circuit in response to the 
impulse, which determines the path followed 
by the current impulse, or where in the cir-
cuit the  ­voltage impulse appears. Just after 
the impulse, the capacitor voltage is not zero, 
as in a short ­circuit, but is equal to the charge 
deposited by the ­current impulse divided by 
the capacitance,
	
1.	 If in the preceding case the capacitor is 
initially charged, superposition can be 
applied. The capacitor is first considered 
uncharged, and the preceding concepts 
applied. The charge or voltage due to ini-
tially stored energy is then added algebra-
ically to the charge or voltage due to the 
impulse.
•	 When a voltage or current impulse is applied 
to an RL circuit, an uncharged inductor ini-
tially acts as an open circuit in response to the 
impulse, which determines where in the cir-
cuit the voltage impulse appears, or the path 
followed by the current impulse. Just after the 
impulse, the current through the inductor is 
not zero but is equal to the flux linkage estab-
lished by the voltage impulse divided by the 
inductance.
	
1.	 If in the preceding case the inductor is 
initially charged, superposition can be 
applied. The inductor is first considered 
uncharged, and the preceding concepts 
applied. The flux linkage or current due to 
initially stored energy is then added alge-
braically to the flux linkage or current due 
to the impulse.
•	 In an RLC circuit, and in response to step or 
impulse inputs, capacitors and inductors act as 
in RC and RL circuits, respectively.
•	 Current and voltage values at t = 0+ are the ini-
tial values for determining current and voltage 
as functions of time.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Always check if at t = 0+, capacitor voltages or 
inductor currents are forced to change in order 
to satisfy KVL and KCL.
	
2.	In the case of impulse inputs, ascertain the pas-
sage of impulses in the circuit, with capacitors 
acting as short circuits and inductors as open 
circuits.

Objective and Overview
Chapter 18 was concerned with circuit responses to 
the basic step and impulse inputs. The present chapter 
extends the analysis to responses resulting from switch-
ing operations in circuits having initial energy storage in 
capacitors and inductors, which involve instantaneous 
redistribution of charge in capacitors and flux linkage in 
inductors. These instantaneous redistributions are nec-
essarily effected by current or voltage impulses. The dis-
cussion illustrates some important and useful concepts.
The chapter begins with the series and parallel con-
nections of capacitors having initial charges and then 
considers the dual case of series and parallel connec-
tions of inductors having initial currents. It is shown 
that the analysis of several types of circuits is greatly 
facilitated by applying the concept of equivalent capac-
itance and inductance. As to be expected from the 
linearity of the circuits under consideration, superposi-
tion can be applied to obtain the total charges of capac-
itors, and the total flux linkages of inductors, due to 
applied excitation in the presence of initial energy stor-
age. The discussion illustrates how charge is conserved 
in capacitive circuits and how flux linkage is conserved 
in inductive circuits. The effect of adding resistance is 
examined and it is demonstrated that energy can be 
trapped in a circuit even in the presence of resistors.
19.1  Series and Parallel Connections 
of Capacitors with Initial Charges
When capacitors having initial stored energy are con-
nected in series or in parallel, with or without addi-
tional external input, superposition applies because the 
circuit is LTI. In order to determine the redistribution of 
capacitor charges or voltages, it is usually convenient to 
apply the concept of equivalent series or parallel capac-
itance, discussed in Section 7.3. It may be wondered, 
however, if the values of these equivalent capacitors 
under conditions of no initial charges apply in the pres-
ence of initial charges. The answer is embodied in the 
following concept:
Concept: When capacitors in series or in parallel have ini-
tial charges, the equivalent series or parallel capacitance is the 
same as in the absence of initial charges.
This conclusion follows quite simply from the fact 
that the capacitance of an ideal capacitor is a positive 
constant (Equation 7.1) that is determined by the geom-
etry of the system and the dielectric properties of the 
medium in which the electric field exists, as exempli-
fied by Equation 7.3. The capacitance is independent of 
capacitor charge or voltage. If the capacitance depends 
on the charge, then the system is not linear any more. 
It follows that Ceqs and Ceqp are given by Equations 7.40 
and 7.49, respectively, in the presence of initial charges 
on the capacitances.
19.1.1  Capacitors in Parallel
To investigate the behavior of capacitors in parallel, 
consider the case of a 2 μF capacitor C1 having an initial 
charge q1(0) = 16 μC connected at t = 0 to a 6 μF capacitor 
C2 having an initial charge q2(0) = 24 μC (Figure 19.1a). 
The initial voltages of C1 and C2 are 16/2  =  8  V and 
24/6 = 4 V, respectively.
When connected together, the voltages across C1 and C2 
are forced to change instantaneously to become equal, in 
accordance with KVL. Since the change is instantaneous, 
it can only be accomplished by a current impulse that 
transfers charge from the capacitor of larger initial volt-
age (C1 having a voltage of 8 V) to the capacitor of lower 
initial voltage (C2 having a voltage of 4 V). This reduces 
the voltage of C1 and increases the voltage of C2 so as to

equalize the voltage across the two capacitors. Evidently, 
the final voltage will be intermediate between the ini-
tial voltages of the two capacitors. The current impulse 
is shown as Δqδt in Figure 19.1b flowing from C1 to C2 
between t = 0− and t = 0+. Note that charge flows in the 
direction of a voltage drop, from the capacitor having the 
higher initial voltage to the capacitor having the lower 
initial voltage although C1 is of smaller capacitance than 
C2 and has the smaller charge.
The total initial charge of 40 μC becomes distributed 
over the two capacitors in parallel, having a combined 
capacitance of 8 μF. The final voltage will therefore be 
40/8 = 5 V. The final charges on C1 and C2 are 10 μC and 
30 μC, respectively (Figure 19.1c). C1 has lost 6 μC and 
C2 has gained 6 μC. The strength of the impulse is the 
charge transferred, so that Δq = 6 μC. Since the charge 
lost by C1 is the charge gained by C2, charge is conserved 
between the two capacitors. This must be the case, 
because charge is confined to the capacitor plates that 
are connected together and cannot flow anywhere else.
The preceding argument can be formalized by using 
the concept of the equivalent parallel capacitor, Ceqp, 
whose value is (2 + 6) = 8 μF. Recall from Chapter 3 that 
equivalence of two circuits between a given pair of ter-
minals means that the two circuits have the same volt-
age–current relation between these terminals. It can be 
argued that the voltage across Ceqp is the same as that 
of the parallel combination of C1 and C2. If we consider 
the initial charges on C1 and C2 in Figure 19.1c as result-
ing from some currents i1(t) and i2(t), respectively, then 
the total current of C1 and C2 in parallel (Figure 19.1c) is 
i1(t) + i2(t). By equivalence, the charge on Ceqp must result 
from a current i1(t) + i2(t). Since q1 is the time integral of 
i1(t) and q2 is the time integral of i2(t), then the charge on 
Ceqp is the sum of the two integrals, that is, the sum of q1 
and q2, which is 40 μC (Figure 19.1d). The voltage of Ceqp is 
therefore 40/8 = 5 V, which, by equivalence, must also be 
the voltage across the parallel combination of C1 and C2.
It is of interest to compare the initial and final energies 
stored in the two capacitors. The initial stored energy is

As a result of redistribution of charge, 12 μJ are lost. 
That the final energy is less than the initial energy does 
not violate conservation of energy. Mathematically, this 
discrepancy is manifested as the integral of p = Ri2 over 
the duration of the impulse, where R is the ideally zero 
resistance of the connection between the two capacitors 
and i2 is the square of an impulse. The product Ri2 is 
indeterminate, but not zero. Physically, energy is dis-
sipated in some residual resistance of the connection, 
which is inevitably present, and in electromagnetic 
radiation due to charge acceleration. If the capacitors 
are connected by a resistor, it can be readily shown that 
the power dissipated in the resistor accounts for the dif-
ference in the initial and final energies of the capacitors.
It may be concluded, therefore, that when two or more 
capacitors having initial energy storage are paralleled 
together, charge is redistributed among the capacitors by 
current impulses so as to equalize the voltage across them. 
If a current pulse is applied to the parallel combination, 
charge is added to each capacitor, while keeping a common 
voltage across them. The distribution of charge among the 
capacitors is conveniently determined using the equivalent 
parallel capacitor, as illustrated in the following example.
Example 19.1:  Paralleling of 
Initially Charged Capacitors
Given three capacitors C1  =  2  μF having a charge of 
24 μC, C2 = 4 μF having a charge 24 μC, and C3 = 6 μF 
having a charge of 12 μC, it is required to determine 
(a) the voltage across the capacitors when connected in 
parallel and (b) the voltage and charge on each capaci-
tor after the application of a 9 mA, 4 ms, pulse to the 
paralleled capacitors.
Solution:
	 (a)	 The initial charge and voltage on each capacitor are 
shown in Figure 19.2a. When connected in parallel, 
Ceqp = 12 μF (Figure 19.2b). From conservation of 
charge, the charge on Ceqp is the sum of the charges 
on the individual capacitors, which is 60 μC. The 
voltage of Ceqp is 60/12 = 5 V. From equivalence, 
this must be the voltage across the parallel com-
bination. It follows that the charges on C1, C2, and 
C3 are, respectively, 2 × 5 = 10 μC, 4 × 5 = 20 μC, 
and 6 × 5 = 30 μC (Figure 19.2c). The total charge is 
60 μC, as it should be.
	 (b)	 The 9 mA pulse of 4 ms duration delivers a charge 
of 9 × 4 = 36 μC. Applied to Ceqp, the total charge 
is now 96  μC, and the voltage is 96/12  =  8  V 
(Figure 19.3a). From equivalence, the voltage across 
the parallel combination is also 8 V, which means 
that the charges on C1, C2, and C3 are, respectively, 
2 × 8 = 16 μC, 4 × 8 = 32 μC, and 6 × 8 = 48 μC (Figure 
19.3b). The total charge is 96 μC, as it should be.
Simulation: The circuit for part (a) is entered as in 
Figure  19.4a. PSpice requires that every node should 
have a path of finite or zero resistance to ground, which 
means that nodes isolated from ground by ideal capaci-
tors or current sources are not allowed and will give a 
“floating” node error. In circuit terminology, floating 

Switched Circuits with Initial Energy Storage

denotes isolation from ground. A 100 MΩ resistor con-
nected between the upper node and ground in Figure 
19.4 avoids the “floating” of the upper node and is suf-
ficiently large so as not to significantly affect the results. 
The initial voltages on the capacitors are entered as 
explained previously. Two normally open switches 
have been added as the Sw_tClose part from the EVAL 
library. The desired closure time of the switch is set at 
1 ms in the Property Editor spreadsheet of the switch 
so as to show both the initial and final voltages of the 
capacitors. Voltage markers have been added to indi-
cate voltages. In the simulation profile, Time domain 
(Transient) analysis is chosen, 2 ms entered for ‘Run to 
time’, 0 entered for ‘Start saving data after’, and 0.5 μs 
entered for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simulation is 
run, the graph in Figure 19.5 is displayed showing the 
initial voltages of 2, 6, and 12 V, and the final voltage of 
5 V, as determined previously.
The circuit for part (b) is entered as illustrated in Figure 
19.4b. The current source is IPULSE from the SOURCE 
library. The parameters of the source are more fully 
explained in Appendix C. I1 is the initial current level, 
which is zero; I2 is the higher level of current, which is the 
9 mA magnitude; and TD is the time delay, after t = 0, when 
the pulse is applied. This is set to 1 ms in the simulation so 
as to display the initial conditions, TR is the rise time of the 
pulse; TF is its fall time; PW is the pulse width, which is 
4 ms; and PER is the period of the pulse. Since only a single 
pulse is required, the period is set larger than the duration 
of the simulation. TR and TF are set at 1 ns, which is small 
compared to the pulse width of 4 ms, so that the pulse is 
“square” rather than trapezoidal. In the simulation profile, 
Time domain (Transient) analysis is chosen, 6m entered for 
‘Run to time’, 0 entered for ‘Start saving data after’, and 
0.5u entered for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simulation 
is run, the graph of Figure 19.6 is displayed. The voltage 
increases ­linearly during the pulse from 5 to 8 V.

When considering capacitors connected in series and

the voltages across the individual capacitors in the fol-
lowing cases:
	
1.	A current pulse is applied to the series 
combination.
	
2.	A steady voltage is applied to the series 
combi­nation.
	
3.	The two terminals of the series combination are 
connected together.
These cases will be considered in the following

equivalent series capacitance is very useful, particularly 
in the last two cases.
Example 19.2:  Charged Capacitors in Series
A current pulse of 3  A amplitude and 4  s duration is 
applied to three capacitors in series: C1 = 6 F, C2 = 3 F, 
and C3 = 2 F (Figure 19.7a). It is required to determine 
the voltages across the capacitors (a) when the capaci-
tors are initially uncharged and (b) when C1, C2, and C3 
have initial charges of 12, 6, and, 2 C, respectively.
Solution:
	 (a)	 Overall, the current pulse can be considered to 
deposit a charge of +12 C on the top plate of C1 
and to remove +12 C from the bottom plate of 
C3, leaving a charge of −12 C on this plate. There 
will be induced charges in the remaining plates of 
the capacitors (Figure 19.7b) so that each capaci-
tor will have a charge of 12 C on its top plate 
and −12 C on its bottom plate. There is zero net 
charge (+12 and −12 C) on the capacitor plates 
that are connected together. The voltages on the 
capacitors are v1 = 12/6 = 2 V, v2 = 12/3 = 4 V, and 
v3 = 12/2 = 6 V. The total voltage across the three 
capacitors is 12 V.
	
	 Ceqs can be evaluated by considering two capacitors 
at a time. The series capacitance of the 6 F and 3 F 
capacitors is (6 × 3)/(6 + 3) = 2 F. The series capaci-
tance of this and the 2 F capacitor is 1 F (Figure 19.7). 
The 3 A current pulse deposits 12 C of charge at 
t = 4 s, the voltage across Ceqs being 12/1 = 12 V, the 
same as that across the series combination.
	 (b)	 When the capacitors have arbitrarily assigned 
initial charges (Figure 19.8a), the charge on Ceqs is 
clearly not the same as the individual charge of any 
of the three capacitors, because these individual 
charges are all different. But because of equiva-
lence, the v–i relation is the same, even with i = 0, so 
that the voltage across Ceqs must be the same as the 
voltage across the series combination. The voltages 
of the individual capacitors are v10 = 12/6 = 2 V, 
v20 = 6/3 = 2 V, and v30 = 2/2 = 1 V. The total volt-
age is 5 V, which must be the voltage across Ceqs. It 
follows that the charge of Ceqs is 1 × 5 = 5 C. That is, 
the charge on Ceqs must be consistent with the value 
of this capacitor and the voltage across it. The total 
energy stored in the three capacitors is no longer 
the same as that stored in Ceqs, because the three 
capacitors are charged individually and arbitrarily.
After the current pulse is applied to the three 
capacitors, the resulting charges and voltages of the 
three capacitors can be determined from superposi-
tion, since the system is linear. This implies that the 
charge on each capacitor due to the current pulse 
simply adds to the initial charge already present on 
that capacitor. The current pulse deposits 12 C on 
Ceqs at t = 4 s, increasing the charge on this capacitor 
to 17 C and the voltage to 17/1 = 17 V. The charge 
on each of the three capacitors must increase by the 
same amount as that on Ceqs, since the same current 
is applied for the same duration. The final charges 
are q1f = 12 + 12 = 24 C, q2f = 6 + 12 = 18 C, and 
q3f = 2 + 12 = 14 C (Figure 19.7b). The voltages on the 
three capacitors are v1f = 24/6 = 4 V, v2f = 18/3 = 6 V, 
and v3f = 14/2 = 7 V, the total being 17 V, as for Ceqs.

The charges and voltages for C1, C2, C3, and 
Ceqs are listed in Table 19.1. The “No initial stor-
age” row refers to the values found in (a) prior to 
the 4 s pulse. The row that follows lists the initial 
conditions. The last row indicates the charges and 
voltages at t = 4 s, these being the sum of the cor-
responding values in the two preceding rows.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as illustrated in Figure 
19.9. 100 MΩ resistors are added in order to avoid a float-
ing node error in the simulation, and the current source 
is entered as explained in the preceding example. The 
initial voltages on the capacitors are added as described 
previously. In the simulation profile, Time domain 
(Transient) analysis is chosen, 6 entered for ‘Run to time’, 
0 entered for ‘Start saving data after’, and 0.5 m entered 
for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simulation is run, the 
graph in Figure 19.10 is displayed showing the initial and 
final voltages at the nodes with voltage markers. The ini-
tial voltages, with respect to ground, are (i) 1 V, the voltage 
across C3; (ii) 3 V, the sum of the voltages across C2 and C3; 
and (iii) 5 V, the voltage across the three capacitors. These 
voltages increase linearly during the pulse and reach, in 
the same order, 7, 13, and 17 V, corresponding, at t = 4 s, to 
v3 = 7 V, v2 = 6 V, and v1 = 4 V, as in Figure 19.8b.

is Ceqs = 1 μF. When 15 V are applied to the series 
combination and to Ceqs, a current impulse flows that 
will instantaneously charge Ceqs to 15 V by deposit-
ing a charge of 15 μC on Ceqs (Figure 19.11a). By cir-
cuit equivalence, this same charge is applied to the 
three capacitors. Since the capacitors have zero ini-
tial energy storage, the charge on each of the three 
capacitors will be the same 15 μC (Equation 7.45). It 
follows that v1 = 15/6 = 2.5 V, v2 = 15/3 = 5 V, and 
v3 = 15/2 = 7.5 V. The total voltage is 15 V, as it should 
be. Note how the charge was determined first from 
Ceqs and deduced for the individual capacitors.
	 (b)	 When the capacitors are initially charged, the total 
voltage is 5  V, which, by circuit equivalence, is 
also the voltage on Ceqs. The charge on Ceqs will be 
(5 V) × (1 μF) = 5 μC (Figure 19.11b). The applied 
15 V will bring the charge on Ceqs to 15 μC, which 
must be due to a flow of charge of 10 μC from the 
applied source. By circuit equivalence, this same 
charge must flow through the three series capaci-
tors, as illustrated in Figure 19.11c, increasing the 
charge on each capacitor by 10 μC. Hence, the final 
charges and voltages will be as follows:

15 V as it should be.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 19.12. 
100 MΩ resistors and initial voltages on the capacitors 
have been added as explained previously. A normally 
open switch is added and set to close at 1 m.
In the simulation profile, Time domain (Transient) analy-
sis is chosen, 2 m entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 entered for 
‘Start saving data after’, and 0.5 μs entered for ‘Maximum 
step size’. After the simulation is run, the graph in 
Figure 19.13 is displayed showing the initial and final volt-
ages at the nodes with voltage markers. The initial voltages, 
with respect to ground, are read using the cursor as 5.000, 
3.000, and 1.000 V corresponding to v10 = 5 – 3 = 2 V, v20 = 3 
– 1 = 2 V, and v30 = 1 V.  The final voltages, with respect 
to ground, are read using the cursor as 6,000, 11,333, 
and 15,000 V corresponding to v1f = 15 – 34/3 = 11/3 V, 
v2f = (34/3) − 6 = 16/3 V, and v3f = 6 V.
The preceding two examples illustrate the following 
concept:
Concept: When an excitation is applied to capacitors in 
series or in parallel having initial stored energy, the charge 
due to the applied excitation adds algebraically to the 
charge initially stored in each capacitor, in accordance with 
superposition.

Repeat Example 19.3 assuming the initial charges on the 
capacitors are q10 = 18 μC, q20 = 12 μC, and q30 = 10 μC.
Ans. (a) As in Example 19.3; (b) q1f = 21 μC, q2f = 15 μC, 
q3f = 13 μC.
Example 19.4:  Ring Connection of Capacitors
Consider three capacitors having initial charges and volt-
ages as shown in Figure 19.14 and connected in series with 
a switch that is closed at t = 0. It is required to determine 
the final charges and voltages on the three capacitors.
Solution:
Ceqs can be determined by considering the capaci-
tors two at time. Thus, the two 8 μF capacitors C1 and 
C2 in series give a capacitance of 4  μF. This, in series 
with the 4 μF capacitor C3, gives Ceqs = 2 μF. The volt-
age on Ceqs is the voltage drop across the switch, which 
is Vaa′ = 2 + 10 − 4 = 8 V. It follows that the charge on Ceqs 
is (8 V) × (2 μF) = 16 μC (Figure 19.15a). When the switch 
is closed, Ceqs completely discharges, causing the flow of 
16 μC in the clockwise direction (Figure 19.15b). By cir-
cuit equivalence, 16 μC will also flow in the clockwise 
direction in the original circuit when the switch is closed 
in this circuit (Figure 19.16). As a result, C1 is completely 
discharged. The 16  μC add to the charge on the top 
plate of C2, which becomes +48 μC. The charge on the 
negatively charged plate of C3 will be −40 + 16 = −24 μC 
(Figure 19.16). The final voltages on the capacitors will be 
v1f = 0, v2f = 48/8 = 6 V, and v3f = 24/4 = 6 V. The total volt-
age around the mesh is zero, in accordance with KVL.
It is seen from Figures 19.14 and 19.16 that the charges 
at the capacitor nodes, before and after the switch is 
closed, are as follows:

Charge is therefore conserved at each of the nodes. 
Evidently, this is because the charge can only be redis-
tributed between the capacitor plates connected to a 
given node and cannot flow elsewhere.
It should be noted that when the switch connected 
between terminals ‘a’ and a′ is closed, charges are redis-
tributed instantaneously through current impulses. As 
explained in the case of parallel connection of capacitors, 
energy is lost. Thus, the energy stored in Figure 19.14 is 
0.5 × 2 × 16 + 0.5 × 10 × 40 + 0.5 × 4 × 32 = 280 μJ. The energy 
stored in Figure 19.16 is 0.5 × 6 × 24 + 0.5 × 6 × 48 = 216 μJ.

lems involving capacitors.
Example 19.4 illustrates the following concept concern-
ing conservation of charge:
Concept: Charge is conserved at any node in a circuit at the 
instant of a sudden change as long as no current impulses are 
applied from an external source to the node at the instant of 
the sudden change.
Conservation of charge is in accordance with KCL.

19.2  Series and Parallel Connections 
of Inductors with Initial Currents
The case of inductors with initial currents parallels 
closely that of capacitors discussed in the preceding sec-
tion, as to be expected from duality. Thus,
Concept: When inductors in series or in parallel have initial 
currents, the equivalent series and parallel inductances are 
the same as when there are no initial currents.
This conclusion follows from the fact that the induc-
tance of an ideal inductor is a positive constant that 
depends on the geometry of the system, on the number 
of turns of the coil, and on the magnetic properties of the

medium in which the magnetic field exists, as exempli-
fied in Equation 7.24. The inductance is independent of 
the current in the inductor. If the inductance depends 
on the current, then the system is not linear any more. It 
follows that Leqs and Leqp are given by Equations 7.60 and 
7.69, Chapter 3, respectively, in the presence of initial 
currents in the inductors.
The following examples are essentially the duals of 
those considered for the case of capacitors.
19.2.1  Inductors in Series
To investigate the behavior of inductors in series, sup-
pose that a 2 μH inductor L1 having a current i1(0) = 8 A is 
connected at t = 0 to a 6 μH inductor L2 having a current 
i2(0) = 4 A by simultaneously moving the two switches, 
as shown in Figure 19.20. It is required to determine 
the final current in each inductor and in the equivalent 
inductor and to compare the initial and final energies 
stored in L1 and L2.
Figure 19.20 illustrates how the initial currents may 
be established in practice prior to connecting the induc-
tors in series. The switches are of the make-before-break 
type, that is, they make contact with the final contact 
before breaking with the initial contact. This ensures that 
the inductor current is not interrupted during switch-
ing. Interrupting the inductor current during switching 
means that the inductor current becomes zero in a very 
short time interval, which implies a large di/dt. This, in 
turn, gives rise to a large Ldi/dt voltage across the switch 
contacts as they interrupt the current. The large voltage 
causes breakdown of the air dielectric between the con-
tacts, leading to an arc discharge between the contacts. 
The high current density of the arc can damage the con-
tacts due to localized burning. This kind of precaution 
is always necessary when interrupting currents through 
inductors. The resistors across the current sources ensure 
that these sources in Figure 19.20 are not left open cir-
cuited after the switches move to their new positions.
The initial flux linkages in L1 and L2 are λ1(0) = (2 μH)
(8 A) = 16 μVs and λ2(0) = (6 μH)(4 A) = 24 μVs, respectively 
(Figure 19.21a). When connected together, the currents 
through L1 and L2 are forced to change instantaneously to 
become equal, in accordance with KCL. Since the change 
is instantaneous, it can only be accomplished by a volt-
age impulse that reduces the flux linkage of the induc-
tor having the larger initial current (L1 of current 8  A) 
and increases the flux linkage of the inductor having the 
smaller initial current (L2 of current 4 A), so as to equalize 
the current through the two inductors. Evidently, the final 
current will be intermediate between the initial currents of 
the two inductors. The voltage impulse, shown as Δλδt in 
Figure 19.21b between t = 0− and t = 0+, is of the polar-
ity indicated. It adds Δλ to the flux linkage of the induc-
tor having the larger inductance and flux linkage, but 
smaller current, and subtracts Δλ from the flux linkage 
of the inductor having the smaller inductance and flux 
linkage, but larger current. The total flux linkage remains 
the same.
The total initial flux linkage of 40 μVs becomes dis-
tributed over the two inductors in series, having a 
combined inductance of 8  μH. The final current will 
therefore be 40/8 = 5 A. The final flux linkages of L1 and 
L2 are 10 and 30 μVs, respectively (Figure 19.21c). The 
flux linkage in L1 has decreased by 6 μVs, whereas the 
flux linkage of L2 has increased by 6 μVs. The strength 
of the impulse is the flux linkage transferred, so that 
Δλ = 6 μVs. Since the flux linkage lost by L1 is the flux 
linkage gained by L2, flux linkage is conserved around 
the mesh formed by the two inductors. Note that in 
going around the mesh, say in the counterclockwise 
direction, the flux linkages of L1 and L2, as well as Δλ 
that adds to the flux linkage of L2, are all in the same 
direction and can all be considered to have the same 
positive sign. On the other hand, Δλ that subtracts from 
the flux linkage of L2 is in the opposite direction and 
will therefore have a negative sign.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The preceding argument can be formalized by using 
the concept of the equivalent series inductor, Leqs, whose 
value is (2 + 6) = 8 μH. From the concept of equivalence, 
the current through Leqs is the same as that of the series 
combination of L1 and L2. If we consider the initial flux 
linkages of L1 and L2 as resulting from some voltages 
v1(t) and v2(t), respectively, then the total voltage of  L1 
and L2 in series is v1(t) + v2(t). By equivalence, the flux 
linkage of Leqs must result from a voltage v1(t)  +  v2(t). 
Since the flux linkage of L1 is the time integral of v1(t) 
and the flux linkage of L2 is the time integral of v2(t), 
then the flux linkage of Leqs is the sum of the two inte-
grals, that is, the sum of the two flux linkages, which is 
40 μVs (Figure 19.1). The current through Leqs is therefore 
40/8 = 5 A, which by equivalence, must also be the cur-
rent through the series combination of L1 and L2.

As a result of readjustment of current by the voltage

As explained for the case of two paralleled capacitors 
in connection with Figure 19.1, the discrepancy between 
the initial and final values of energy does not violate 
conservation of energy. The discrepancy is attributed to 
an impulse of voltage that appears across the two induc-
tors, involving an infinite voltage due to the impulse 
applied across an infinite parallel resistance. In the pres-
ence of such a resistance, it can be readily shown that 
the power dissipated in the resistor accounts for the dif-
ference in the initial and final energies of the inductors.
Example 19.5:  Series Connection of Charged Inductors
Given three inductors, L1  =  2  μH having a current of 
12 A, L2 = 4 μH having a current of 6 A, and L3 = 6 μH 
having a current of 2 A, it is required to determine (a) the 
current through the inductors when connected in series 
and (b) the current and flux linkage for each inductor 
after the application of a 9 mV, 4 ms, pulse to the series 
combination of inductors.
Solution:
	 (a)	 The initial current and flux linkage for each induc-
tor are shown in Figure 19.22a. When connected 
in series, Leqs = 12 μH (Figure 19.22b). From equal-
ity of voltages across the series combination and 
across Leqs, the flux linkage of Leqs is the sum of the 
flux linkages on the individual inductors, which is 
60 μVs. The current of Leqs is 60/12 = 5 A. From 
equivalence, this must be the current through the 
series combination. It follows that the flux linkages 
of L1, L2, and L3 are, respectively, 2 × 5 = 10 μVs, 
4 × 5 = 20 μVs, and 6 × 5 = 30 μVs (Figure 19.22c). 
The total flux linkage is 60 μVs, as it should be.
	 (b)	 The 9 mV pulse of 4 ms duration establishes a flux 
linkage of 9 × 4 = 36 μVs of the same sign as that of 
Leqs. The total flux linkage is now 96 μVs, and the 
current is 96/12 = 8 A (Figure 19.23a). From equiv-
alence, the current through the series combination 
is also 8  A, which means that the flux linkages 
of L1, L2, and L3 are, respectively, 2 × 8 = 16 μVs, 
4 × 8 = 32 μVs, and 6 × 8 = 48 μVs (Figure 19.23b). 
The total flux linkage is 96 μVs, as it should be.
Simulation: The circuit for part (a) is entered as illustrated 
in Figure 19.24a. The following should be noted concern-
ing this schematic: (i) In order to provide a path for the ini-
tial current in each inductor, normally closed switches are 
connected in parallel rather than in series. The switches 
are set to open at t = 1 ms, thereby connecting the conduc-
tors in series. (ii) PSpice does not allow loops of zero resis-
tance, which can arise from loops of inductors, or voltage 
sources, or both. The 1 nΩ resistor in Figure 19.24a avoids 
such a loop when the switches open. When the switches 
are closed, a zero resistance is avoided in the other 
two  meshes by the resistances of the closed  switches.

★19.2.2  Inductors in Parallel
The behavior of inductors in parallel is examined in the 
next three examples, which are the duals of Examples 
19.2 through 19.4 for capacitors.
Example 19.6:  Charged Inductors in Parallel
A voltage pulse of 3 V amplitude and 4 s duration is 
applied to three inductors in parallel: L1 = 6 H, L2 = 3 H, 
and L3 = 2 H (Figure 19.27a). It is required to determine 
the currents in the inductors (a) when the inductors are 
initially uncharged and (b) when L1, L2, and L3 have ini-
tial flux linkages of 12, 6, and 2 Vs, respectively.
Solution:
	 (a)	 The voltage pulse establishes a flux linkage of

i2 = 12/3 = 4 A, and i3 = 12/2 = 6 A. The total current 
through the three inductors is 12 A (Figure 19.27b).
	
	 Leqp can be evaluated by considering two inductors at 
a time. The parallel inductance of the 6 and 3 H induc-
tors is (6 × 3)/(6 + 3) = 2 H. The parallel inductance 
of this and the 2 H inductor is 1 H. The 3 V voltage 
establishes 12 Vs of flux linkage at t = 4 s, the cur-
rent through Leqp being 12/1 = 12 A, the same as that 
through the parallel combination (Figure 19.27b).
	 (b)	 When the voltage is applied to the three induc-
tors, with initial flux linkages (Figure 19.28a), 
the flux linkage in Leqp is clearly not the same as 
the individual flux linkage in any of the three 
inductors, since these individual flux link-
ages are all different. But because of equiva-
lence, the current in Leqp must be the same as 
that in the paralleled inductors. The currents 
in the individual inductors are i10 = 12/6 = 2 A, 
i20 = 6/3 = 2 A, and i30 = 2/2 = 1 A. The total 
current is 5  A, which must be the current in 
Leqp. It follows that the flux linkage in Leqp is 
1 × 5 = 5 Vs (Figure 19.28a).

The voltage pulse of 3 V amplitude and 4 s dura-
tion adds a flux linkage of 12 Vs to the flux linkages 
present in Leqp and in each of the three paralleled 
inductors. λeqp becomes 17 Vs and ieqp = 17 A (Figure 
19.28b). The application of superposition to the indi-
vidual inductors is illustrated in Table 19.2. The “No 
initial storage” row refers to the values found previ-
ously (Figure 19.27b). The row that follows lists the 
initial conditions. The last row indicates the flux link-
ages and currents at t = 4 s, after the voltage pulse 
is over. The values in this row are the sums of the 
corresponding values in the two preceding rows. 
The initial and final values are also shown in Figure 
19.28. The final flux linkages are λ1f = 12 + 12 = 24 Vs, 
λ2f  =  6  +  12  =  18  Vs, λ3f  =  2  +  12  =  14 Vs, and 
λeqp = 2 + 12 = 17 Vs (Figure 19.28b). The currents in the 
three inductors are i1f = 24/6 = 4 A, i2f = 18/3 = 6 A, 
and i3f  =  14/2  =  7  A, the total being 17  A, as for 
Leqp. Note from Table 19.2 that superposition can be 
applied to flux linkages as well as currents.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 19.29. 
1 nΩ resistors are added in order to avoid short-circuit 
loops, and the voltage source is entered as explained in

tors are added as described previously in the Property

the graph displayed in Figure 19.30 shows the initial 
and final currents in the three inductors. The currents 
increase linearly from their initial values to their final 
values during the application of the 4 s pulse.
Primal Exercise 19.8
A 1 V pulse of 2ms duration is applied to three inductors 
of 0.2, 0.8, and 0.04 μH connected in parallel. The induc-
tors were initially uncharged. Determine, at the end of 
the pulse, (a) the flux linkage of each inductor and the 
current through it and (b) the inductance of the equiva-
lent inductor, its flux linkage, and current.
Ans. (a) 2 μVs; 10, 2.5, and 50 A, respectively; (b) 0.032 μH, 
2 μVs, 62.5 A.
Example 19.7:  Steady Current Applied 
to Inductors in Parallel
Let a steady current of 15 A be applied to the parallel-con-
nected inductors in Figure 19.31, by opening the switch 
at t = 0, where L1 = 6 μH, L2 = 3 μH, and L3 = 2 μH. It is 
required to determine the flux linkages and currents of the 
inductors: (a) with zero initial energy storage and (b) with 
the initial currents on the inductors of i10 = 2 A, i20 = 2 A, 
and i30 = 1 A.
Solution:
 	 (a)	 The inductance of 6 μH in parallel with 3 μH is 2 μH, 
and the parallel inductance of this and the 2  μH 
capacitor is Leqp = 1 μH. When 15 A are applied to the 
parallel combination and to Leqp, a voltage impulse

occurs that instantaneously establishes a flux link-
age of 15  μVs in Leqp (Figure 19.31). From circuit 
equivalence, this same voltage impulse is applied 
to the parallel combination of inductors. Since 
these inductors have zero initial energy storage, the 
flux linkage on each of the three inductors will be 
the same as on Leqp. It follows that i1 = 15/6 = 2.5 A, 
i2 = 15/3 = 5 A, and i3 = 15/2 = 7.5 A. The total cur-
rent is 15 A, as it should be.
	 (b)	 When the inductors are initially charged, the total 
current is 5 A, which, by circuit equivalence, is also 
the current in Leqp. The flux linkage of Leqp will be 
(5 A) × (1 μH) = 5 μVs (Figure 19.32a). The applied 
15 A will bring the flux linkage to 15 μVs, which 
means an increase of flux linkage of 10 μVs from 
the applied source. By circuit equivalence, this 
same integral of voltage is applied to the three 
inductors, which increases the flux linkage of each 
inductor by 10 μVs. Hence, the final flux linkages 
and currents will be as follows (Figure 19.32b):
	
λ1f = 2 × 6 + 10 = 22 μVs  and  i1f = 22/6 = 11/3 A
	
λ2f = 2 × 3 + 10 = 16 μVs  and  i2f = 16/3 A
	
λ3f = 1 × 2 + 10 = 12 μVs  and  i3f = 12/2 = 6 A
It is seen that i1f + i2f + i3f = (11/3) + (16/3) + 6 = 15 A 
as it should be.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as illustrated in Figure 
19.33. The opening time of the normally closed switch is 
set at 1 ms and its resistance when closed (RCLOSED) 
is set to 1 nΩ. Time domain (Transient) analysis is cho-
sen, 2 ms is entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving 
data after’, and 0.5 μs for ‘Maximum step size’. After the 
simulation is run, the graph in Figure 19.34 is displayed 
showing the initial and final currents for each inductor, 
using current markers. The final currents are read using 
the cursor as 3.6667  A, 5.3333  A, and 5.9971  A corre-
sponding to i1f = 11/3 A, i2f = 16/3 A, and i3f = 6 A.
Problem-Solving Tip

conveniently used to facilitate the solution of 
problems involving inductors.
The preceding two examples illustrate the following 
concept:
Concept: When an excitation is applied to inductors in series 
or in parallel and having initial stored energy, the flux link-
age due to the applied excitation adds algebraically to the flux 
linkage initially stored in each inductor.

ages of the inductors are λ10 = 18 μVs, λ20 = 12 μVs, and 
λ20 = 10 μVs.

Example 19.8:  Redistribution of Currents 
in Paralleled Inductors
Given three inductors having initial flux linkages and 
currents as shown in Figure 19.35 and are paralleled with 
a switch that is opened at t = 0. It is required to determine 
the final currents and flux linkages of the three induc-
tors. This example is the dual of Example 19.4. Because 
there are two voltage rises and one voltage drop in 
Figure 19.14, two currents are shown entering the upper 
node in Figure 19.35 and one current leaving the node.
Solution:
Leqp can be determined by considering the inductors 
two at time. Thus, the two 8  μH inductors in paral-
lel give an inductance of 4 μH. This, in parallel with 
4 μH, gives Leqp = 2 μH. The current in Leqp is the current 
through the switch, in which 2 + 10 − 4 = 8 A. It follows 
that the flux linkage of Leqp is (8 A) × (2 μH) = 16 Vs 
(Figure 19.36a). When the switch is opened, Leqp com-
pletely discharges, which is equivalent to apply-
ing 16  Vs in the opposite direction (Figure 19.36b) 
by means of a voltage impulse of strength 16 Vs, the 
polarity of the voltage impulse being node ‘a’ posi-
tive with respect to node aʹ. By circuit equivalence, 
the same voltage impulse appears between the corre-
sponding nodes in the original circuit. The resulting 
flux linkage of 16 Vs opposes the flux linkages in L1 
and L3 and adds to the flux linkage in L2. It follows that 
λ1 = 0, λ3 = 24 Vs, and λ2 = 48 Vs, so that i1 = 0, i2 = 6 A, 
and i3 = 6 A (Figure 19.37). Note that KCL is satisfied.
Flux linkage is conserved around the three closed 
paths formed by any two inductors. The flux linkages

tive current values are indicated. The opening time 
of the normally closed switch is set at 1 ms and its 
resistance when closed (RCLOSED) is set to 1  nΩ. 
Time domain (Transient) analysis is chosen, 2  ms 
is entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving data

played showing the initial and final currents for each

Example 19.8 illustrates the following concept con-
cerning conservation of flux linkage:
Concept: Flux linkage is conserved around any closed path 
in a circuit at the instant of a sudden change as long as no 
voltage impulses are applied from an external source in the 
closed path at the instant of the sudden change.
Conservation of flux linkage is in accordance with 
KVL.

19.3  Switched Circuits
By switched circuits are meant circuits in which the 
movement of one or more switches changes the circuit 
configuration, as by adding or removing circuit elements 
or by modifying the applied excitation in some specified 
manner. It is to be expected that a switching operation, 
being another form of a sudden change in a circuit, is 
subject to the same basic considerations discussed in this 
chapter and the preceding chapter, such as the following:
	
1.	A capacitor voltage does not change at the 
instant of switching unless forced to by a cur-
rent impulse in order to satisfy KVL. Similarly, 
an inductor current does not change at the 
instant of switching unless forced to by a volt-
age impulse in order to satisfy KCL.
	
2.	KCL and KVL must be satisfied at all times, 
before switching, just after switching, and in the 
steady state.
These basic concepts allow the determination of the 
initial conditions, just after switching, that are required 
for deriving the complete solution following the switch-
ing operation. This is illustrated by the following exam-
ples of switching in first-order and second-order circuits. 
Examples 19.9 and 19.10 illustrate impulsive readjust-
ment in the presence of a resistor, whereas Examples 
19.11 and 19.12 illustrate the “trapping” of stored energy 
in a circuit.
Adding an inductor to the capacitive circuits consid-
ered in this chapter, or a capacitor to the inductor cir-
cuits, does not introduce any important concepts beyond 
those of Chapter 12. The equivalent series or parallel 
capacitor or inductor will have an initial stored energy, 
after the initial switching operation, as in the circuits of 
Chapter 12 and can be analyzed in the same manner dis-
cussed in that chapter. More general switched circuits can 
be analyzed using the Laplace transform (Chapter 22).
Example 19.9:  Switched Parallel RC Circuit
In the circuit in Figure 19.41, capacitor C1 is initially 
charged to V10 = 10 V and C2 is uncharged. The switch 
is closed at t = 0. It is required to determine the variation 
with time of v, the voltage across the capacitors, for t ≥ 0+.
Solution:
Just after the switch is closed, the voltages across C1 and 
C2 are forced to change instantaneously from their initial 
values to a common voltage, by a current impulse, as in 
the case of the two capacitors in Figure 19.1. At t = 0−, 
v and iR are both zero. At t = 0+, v and hence iR jump by 
a finite amount due to redistribution of charge between 
the capacitors. As argued in connection with Equation 
18.22, the time integral of iR, which is the charge leaked 
through the resistor, is zero between t = 0− and at t = 0+, 
because v and hence iR are finite during this interval. It 
follows that charge is conserved at the instant of switching, 
as it flows from C1 to C2.
The initial charge on C1 is 10 × 3 = 30 C, and Ceqp = 5 F. 
v at t = 0+ is 30/5 = 6 V and iR = 6 A. As t → ∞, both 
capacitors are completely discharged and vF and iRF are 
both zero. τ = RC = 5 s. It follows from Equation 11.57 that

It is seen that a current impulse flows from C1 to 
C2, transferring a charge of 12 C, so that the charges 
at t = 0+ are 30 − 12 = 18 C on C1 and 12 C on C2, the 
resulting voltage being 6 V on the two capacitors. KCL 
is i1 − i2 = iR, so that the current impulse cancels out 
from iR, leaving iR = v/R, for t ≥ 0+, where v is given by 
Equation 19.3.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 19.42. 
A normally open switch is set to close at 1 ms so as 
to show the initial voltages across the capacitors, 
which are in turn entered as 10 V for C1 and 0 for C2. 
‘Time domain (Transient)’ analysis is chosen, 15 ms 
is entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving data 
after’, and 1  μs for ‘Maximum step size’. After the 
simulation is run, the graph displayed in Figure 19.43 
shows the initial values of voltages across C1 and 
C2 as 10  V and 0, respectively. When the switch is 
closed, both voltages change to 6 V and decay expo-
nentially thereafter with a time constant of 5 ms. The 
tangent to the exponential at t = 1 ms is entered as 
–1200 * Time + 7.2.
★Example 19.10: Switched Series RL Circuit
The circuit in Figure 19.44 is the dual of that in Figure 
19.41. Inductor L1 has an initial current of I10  =  10  A 
and L2 is uncharged. The switch is closed at t = 0. It is 
required to determine the variation with time of i, the 
current through the inductors for t ≥ 0+.
Solution:
Just after the switch is closed, the currents through L1 
and L2 are forced to change instantaneously from their 
initial values to a common value, by a voltage impulse, 
as in the case of the two inductors in Figure 19.20. At 
t = 0−, i and vR are both zero. At t = 0+, i and hence vR 
jump by a finite amount. In the interval 0− ≤ t ≤ 0+, when 
a voltage impulse appears across the inductors, vR is 
finite and will not affect this impulse (Equation 18.24). 
The reduction in flux linkage of L1 will therefore be 
equal to the increase in flux linkage of L2, so that flux 
linkage is conserved at the instant of switching.

The initial flux linkage of L1 is 10  ×  3  =  30  Vs, and

It is seen that a voltage impulse of 12  Vs appears 
across L1 and L2, reducing the flux linkage in L1 at t = 0+ 
to 30 − 12 = 18 Vs and establishing a flux linkage of 12 Vs 
in L2. The resulting current is 6 A in both inductors. KVL 
is v1 − v2 = vR, so that the voltage impulse cancels out 
from vR, leaving vR = i/G, for t ≥ 0+, where i is given by 
Equation 19.10.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 19.45. 
A normally closed switch is set to open at 1 s so as to 
connect the two inductors in series. The initial currents 
in the inductors are entered as 10 A for L1 and 0 for L2. 
Time domain (Transient) analysis is chosen, 15  s is 
entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving data after’, 
and 1 ms for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simula-
tion is run, the graph displayed is the same as that in 
Figure 19.43 but with the vertical axis representing cur-
rent instead of voltage. When the switch is opened, the 
currents in the two inductors change to 6 A and decay 
exponentially thereafter with a time constant of 5 s.
The following concept is illustrated by Examples 19.9 
and 19.10:
Concept: A finite current does not add to, or subtract from, 
charge at a node during the infinitesimal interval just before and 
just after a switching operation. Similarly, a finite voltage does 
not add to, or subtract from, flux linkage in a closed path during 
the interval just before and just after a switching operation.
Thus, charge is conserved at the nodes in Figure 19.41 
at the instant of switching. Similarly, flux linkage is 
conserved in the mesh in Figure 19.44 at the instant of 
switching.
Example 19.11:  Switched Series RC Circuit
Given two capacitors C1 = 3 F and C2 = 2 F charged to 
10 V each and connected at t = 0 in series with a 2 Ω 
resistor (Figure 19.46a), it is required to determine i as a 
function of time and the final values of v1 and v2.
Solution:
Ceqs = (3 × 2)/(3 + 2) = 1.2 F. The initial voltage of Ceqs is 
the sum of the initial voltages across the two capacitors, 
that is, 20 V. The initial charge on Ceqs is q = 1.2 × 20 = 24 C.

The circuit for t ≥ 0 is shown in Figure 19.46b. As t → ∞, 
Ceqs will completely discharge, and i = 0. The initial value 
of i is 10 A, and the time constant is 2 × 1.2 = 2.4 s. It fol-

The charge q = 24 C is moved by i through the circuit 
in the clockwise direction. The initial charge on C1 is 30 C. 
When 24 C are moved clockwise, the residual charge 
on C1 is 6 C, and the final value of v1 is v1f = 6/3 = 2 V. 
The initial charge on C2 is 20 C. When 24 C are moved 
clockwise, the residual charge on C2 is −4 C and the final 
value of v2 is v2f = −4/2 = −2 V. The voltage across the 
resistor is 2 – 2 = 0, since i goes to zero. Some residual 
charge therefore remains trapped in the capacitors.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Solution:
Leqp = (3 × 2)/(3 + 2) = 1.2 H (Figure 19.49b). The ini-
tial current of Leqp is the sum of the initial currents of 
the two inductors, that is, 20 A. The initial flux link-
age of Leqp is λeqp = 1.2 × 20 = 24 Vs. As t → ∞, Leqp will 
completely discharge, and v = 0. Initial value of v is 
i/G = 10 V, and the time constant is 2 × 1.2 = 2.4 s. It 
follows that v is given by

The initial flux linkage λeqp of 24 Vs is reduced to zero 
as t → ∞. This can be considered to be due to an oppos-
ing flux linkage leqp¢ = − λeqp that arises from the time inte-
gral of v (Figure 19.49b). By equivalence, this leqp¢  also 
appears across L1 and L2 and subtracts from the initial 
flux linkages. The final flux linkages are λ1f = 6 Vs in L1, 
directed upward, and λ2t = 4 Vs in L2, directed down-
ward. A current of 2 A therefore circulates in the two 
inductors (Figure 19.50), representing a residual flux 
linkage that remains trapped in the inductors.

Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 When capacitors in series or in parallel have initial 
charges, the equivalent series or parallel capaci-
tance is the same as in the absence of initial charges.
•	 When inductors in series or in parallel have ini-
tial currents, the equivalent series and parallel 
inductances are the same as when there are no 
initial currents.
•	 When capacitors having different voltages are 
paralleled, charge is instantaneously redistrib-
uted by current impulses, so as to have a com-
mon voltage across the capacitors. This voltage 
can be readily determined from conservation of 
charge and the equivalent parallel capacitance.
•	 When inductors having different currents are 
connected in series, flux linkage is instanta-
neously redistributed by voltage impulses, so as 
to have the same current through the inductors. 
This current can be readily determined from 
conservation of flux linkage and the equivalent 
series inductance.
•	 When an excitation is applied to capacitors in 
series or in parallel having initial stored energy, the 
charge due to the applied excitation adds algebra-
ically to the charge initially stored in each capaci-
tor, in accordance with superposition. The charge 
added and the final voltages across the capacitors 
are most easily determined using the equivalent 
series or parallel capacitance, as applicable.
•	 When an excitation is applied to inductors in 
series or in parallel having initial stored energy, 
the flux linkage due to the applied excitation 
adds algebraically to the flux linkage initially 
present in each inductor, in accordance with 
superposition. The flux linkage added, and the 
final currents in the inductors are most easily 
determined using the equivalent series or paral-
lel inductance, as applicable.
•	 Charge is conserved at any node in a circuit at the 
instant of a sudden change as long as no current 
impulses are applied from an external source to 
the node at the instant of the sudden change.
•	 Flux linkage is conserved around any closed 
path in a circuit at the instant of a sudden change 
as long as no voltage impulses are applied from 
an external source in the closed path at the 
instant of the sudden change.
•	 There is an apparent loss of energy in impul-
sive redistribution of charges in capacitive 
circuits or in the impulsive redistribution 
of flux linkages in inductive circuits, due to 
indeterminate power dissipation by a cur-
rent impulse flowing through zero resistance 
or a voltage impulse appearing across zero 
conductance.
•	 In a switching operation, a capacitor voltage does 
not change at the instant of switching unless 
forced to by a current impulse. Similarly, an 
inductor current does not change at the instant of 
switching unless forced to by a voltage impulse. 
KCL and KVL must be satisfied at all times, before 
switching, just after switching, and in the steady 
state.
•	 A finite current does not add to, or subtract 
from, charge at a node during the infinitesimal 
interval just before and just after a switching 
operation. Similarly, a finite voltage does not 
add to, or subtract from, flux linkage in a closed 
path during the infinitesimal interval just before 
and just after a switching operation.
•	 Stored energy can be trapped in capacitors or in 
inductors in the final, steady state when initial 
charges on capacitors, or initial flux linkages in 
inductors, are not completely neutralized, even 
in the presence of resistors, while KCL, KVL, 
and Ohm’s law are satisfied.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Equivalent series or parallel capacitors can be 
conveniently used to facilitate the solution of 
problems involving capacitors.

Objective and Overview
This chapter introduces convolution, which is a 
­fundamental operation in the time domain that gives 
the response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) ­system 
to an arbitrary input, based solely on its impulse 
response, without any knowledge about the system or 
its constituents.
The chapter begins by explaining two operations that 
are commonly encountered in convolution, namely, 
shifting a function in time and folding a function around 
the vertical axis. The convolution integral is then intro-
duced and interpreted graphically, which leads to a 
general procedure for deriving the convolution integral 
based on the graphical interpretation. Some basic prop-
erties of the convolution operation are then presented, 
followed by some important special cases of convolu-
tion, namely, convolution of staircase functions and 
convolution with impulse and step functions. The chap-
ter ends with a summary of some general properties 
of the convolution integral, illustrated with additional 
examples.
20.1  Shifting in Time and Folding
Before considering convolution, some basics ­concerning 
shifting of functions in time and folding around the 
­vertical axis are discussed.
20.1.1  Shifting in Time
Consider the function, h(λ), where λ is a time variable, as 
shown in the middle trace in Figure 20.1a. It is assumed 
for simplicity and for reasons that will become clear later 
that h(λ) = 0 for λ < 0− and decreases like an exponen-
tial for λ > 0+. Suppose that the function is shifted to the 
right by a, where a is a positive number, such as 5 units 
of time. The origin, where λ = 0, is unchanged so that the 
vertical edge of the function is shifted from the origin to 
λ = a. The magnitude of the function at a particular value 
of λ, say λ = λ1 > 0, is h(λ1), where λ in the function h(λ) is 
replaced by λ1. The value of the shifted function should 
be the same at λ = (λ1 + a) as at λ = λ1. For this to be the 
case, λ in the shifted function should be decreased by a, that 
is, λ is replaced by (λ − a). The shifted function becomes 
h(λ − a), so that at λ = (λ1 + a), h(λ − a) = h((λ1 + a) − a) = 
h(λ1), the same value as for the unshifted function, as it 
should be.
Similarly, if the function is shifted by −a to the left, 
where a is a positive number, the vertical edge of the 
function is moved from the origin to λ = −a (Figure 20.1a). 
The value h(λ1) of the unshifted function should occur 
at λ = (λ1 − a) for the shifted function. λ in the shifted func-
tion should therefore be increased by a, that is, λ is replaced 
by (λ + a). The shifted function becomes h(λ + a), so that 
at λ = (λ1 − a), h(λ + a) = h((λ1 − a) + a) = h(λ1), the same 
value as for the unshifted function, as it should be.
If the function is shifted by a variable amount denoted by the 
symbol t, which could be positive or negative, the same expression

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
h(λ − t) applies in terms of t as for a shift to the right by a posi-
tive quantity t (Figure 20.1b). If t has a positive value a, the 
expression for the shifted function is h(λ − a), as in Figure 
20.1a. If t has a negative value, t = −a, then the expression 
for the shifted function is h(λ + a), again as in Figure 20.1a.
20.1.2  Folding around the Vertical Axis
Next, consider the function h(−λ) (Figure 20.2a). This is 
the same function h(λ) of Figure 20.2a but with λ replaced 
by −λ. It is thus the mirror image of the function h(λ) 
with respect to the vertical axis. It is also described as 
h(λ) folded around the vertical axis. Shifting the func-
tion h(−λ) to the right or left is subject to the same rule 
­illustrated in Figure 20.1a, namely, in shifting to the right 
by a with respect to the same origin, λ in the shifted func-
tion is decreased by a, whereas in shifting to the left by a, 
λ in the shifted function is increased by a, where a is a pos-
itive number. Thus, if the function h(−λ) is shifted to the 
right by a, it becomes h(−(λ − a)) = h(a − λ) (Figure 20.2b). 
Note that the shift is applied to λ in the argument of the given 
function and not to the whole argument −λ. Thus, the argu-
ment −λ becomes (a − λ) and not (−λ − a). Similarly, if the 
function h(−λ) is shifted by a variable amount denoted 
by the symbol t, which could be positive or negative, 
the folded ­function becomes h(t − λ). In other words, λ in 
the function is replaced by (t − λ) when the function is folded 
around the vertical axis and shifted by a variable t.
Primal Exercise 20.1
Derive the expressions for the following functions when 
first folded around the vertical axis and then shifted by t: 
(a) u(λ), (b) u(λ − 3), (c) δ(λ), (d) λu(λ), (e) (λ − 2)u(λ − 2), 
and (f) cos πλ. Note that an even function is unaltered by 
folding around the vertical axis. When folded and shifted, 
the argument of the function could be (t − λ) or (λ − t).
Ans. (a) u(−λ), u(t − λ); (b) u(−λ − 3), u(t − λ − 3); (c) δ(−λ) = 
δ(λ), δ(t − λ) = δ(λ − t ); (d) −λu(−λ), (t − λ)u​(t − λ); (e) (−λ − 2)u​
(−λ − 2), (t − λ − 2)u(t − λ − 2); (f) cos(−πλ) = cos(πλ), 
cos(π(t − λ)) = cos(π(λ − t)).
20.2  Convolution Integral
To illustrate the meaning and significance of convolu-
tion in circuit analysis, consider an LTI circuit or ­system 
whose response h(t) to a unit impulse δ(t) (Figure 20.3a) 
can be determined in some manner, either analyti-
cally, or by simulation, or experimentally by applying 
a large, brief input of a duration that is much shorter 
than the smallest time constant, or response time, of the 
system, as was done in the simulation examples in pre-
ceding chapters. The question is, knowing h(t), can one 
determine the response y(t) to an arbitrary input x(t) 
(Figure 20.3b)? According to convolution theory, y(t) can 
indeed be determined as

where λ is an arbitrary integration variable having the 
dimensions of time. The RHS of Equation 20.1 is a defi-
nite integral that evaluates to a function of t alone.
Equation 20.1 defines a convolution operation, which 
is represented as
	
y t

(20.2)
In words, x t( ) is said to be convolved with h t( ). The 
key concept behind convolution is that the input x(t) can 
be considered as a series of very narrow pulses, each of 
which approximates an impulse. Since the system is 
­linear, these impulse responses can be summed together 
to give y(t).
The first step in deriving the convolution integral, 
therefore, is to approximate x(t) by a series of pulses of 
equal width, Δλ, as illustrated in Figure 20.4a, where 
the approximation can be as close as desired by making 
Δλ sufficiently small. The ith pulse starts at t = λi and 
is of duration Δλ and height x(λi). As Δλ is made very

small, the response to the ith pulse can be considered 
to be the same as the response to an impulse at t = λi 
whose strength is the same as the area of the pulse, 
which is x(λi)Δλ. Let the response to δ(t), a unit impulse 
at the origin, be h(t), as illustrated in Figure 20.4b. Note 
that since δ(t) occurs at the origin, the response h(t) is 
zero for t < 0−, since there is no response to the impulse 
before it occurs. The response to the unit impulse at t = a 
is h(a). A unit impulse that is delayed by λi is δ(t − λi). 
If the strength of the impulse is [x(λi)Δλ], rather unity, 
the impulse is represented as [x(λi)Δλ]δ(t − λi), and the 
response to the impulse for t ≥ λi is y(t) = [x(λi)Δλ]h(t − λi), 
where (t − λi) is the interval of time t after the beginning 
of the impulse response, as illustrated in Figure 20.4c. 
At any particular instant of time t = t1, where t1 − λI = a, 
for example, the response is h(a) as in Figure 20.4b, but 
multiplied by the strength of the impulse. That is, the 
response is [x(λi)Δλ]h(t1 − λi), represented by the ordinate 
b in Figure 20.4c. Since the system is LTI, superposition 
applies, so that the total response due to all the pulses λi 
that occur up to t1 is the sum of the responses to all these 
individual pulses. It follows that

In the limit, as Dl

dropped, replacing λi by λ. Similarly, t1 can be replaced 
by t. The lower limit of the integral is −∞ and the upper 
limit is t. The summation becomes the convolution

(20.4)
Mathematically, the integral of Equation 20.4 rep-
resents an infinite sum, over a continuum of time, of 
responses to impulses, each having an infinitesimal 
strength. Practically, the summation of Equation 20.3 is 
the sum of responses to pulses whose duration is finite 
but small compared with the smallest time constant of 
the circuit or the reciprocal of the highest frequency in 
the circuit’s natural response. Note that in changing the 
summation to integration, the primary time variable 
becomes λ instead of t, the latter becoming a constant 
with respect to the integration.
The integral of Equation 20.4 is the same as that 
of Equation 20.1, except for the upper limit. It is seen 
from Figure 20.4b that if λi, the time at which the 
impulse occurs, exceeds t1, the time at which response 
is required, then the response is zero. This is because a 
physical system operating in real time does not respond 
to an impulse before this impulse occurs. Operation in 
real time means that the system response unfolds for the 
first time as current time progresses. This is in contrast 
to a recorded signal that was captured at an earlier time

and is being replayed later. At any instant of the record-
ing, the future response is already available. Physical 
systems do not anticipate the occurrence of an input 
before it occurs and cannot therefore respond to such 
an input, as explained in Example 11.7. If the response is 
zero for λ > t, then the upper limit in Equation 20.4 could 
just as well be infinity rather than t.
In summary, the following concept applies:
Concept: The response of an LTI circuit to an arbitrary input 
can be considered as the superposition of responses to sufficiently 
narrow pulses, each having an amplitude determined by the 
input. These narrow pulses can be approximated by impulses, 
which naturally leads to a convolution integral involving the 
input function and the impulse response of the circuit.
It is convenient, though by no means essential, to 
assume that x(t) = 0, for t < 0−, which means that the 
lower limit of integration in Equation 20.4 can be taken 
as 0− instead of −∞. This is usually done because of the 
link between convolution and the one-sided Laplace 
transform, which has 0− as the lower limit of integration 
(Section 21.1). Having the lower limit as 0− rather than 0 
would include an impulse at the origin. With the lower 
limit taken as 0−, Equation 20.4 reduces to the form of 
the convolution integral that is conventionally applied 
in circuit analysis, namely,

(20.5)
If the integrand does not include an impulse at the 
origin, then the lower limit of integration can be unam-
biguously taken as zero in Equation 20.5.
It should be emphasized that according to Equation 
20.5, the given function x(t) is now x(λ), a function of 
the time variable λ rather than t. The integration is with 
respect to this new time variable λ, so that t is a constant 
as far as the integration with respect to λ is ­concerned. 
t can be a particular numerical value, in which case 
Equation 20.5 evaluates y(t) at that particular value of t. 
More generally, t can assume any value within a speci-
fied range that depends on the function under consid-
eration, in which case y(t) is obtained as a function of t 
over the given range of t.
20.2.1  Graphical Interpretation
We wish to interpret the convolution integral graphically, 
as this leads to a very useful procedure for deriving the 
convolution integral. We note first of all that, in general, 
an integral represents an area. Equation 20.5 can there-
fore be considered as the area under the product of two 
functions: (1) x(λ), which is simply the given function 
x(t) with the time variable t replaced by another time 
variable λ, and (2) h(t − λ). But what is h(t − λ)? According 
to Figure 20.2, h(t − λ) can be considered to result from 
three steps: (1) t in the impulse response h(t) is replaced 
by λ to give h(λ), as in x(λ); (2) h(λ) is folded around the 
vertical axis, resulting in h(−λ), as in Figure 20.2a; and 
(3) h(−λ) is shifted by t to the right, to give h(t − λ), as 
in Figure 20.2b. These steps are illustrated in Figure 
20.5a. The product x(λ)h(t − λ) is shown in Figure 20.5b. 
According to Equation 20.5, the value of the convolu-
tion integral at t is the area under the product from λ = 0 
to λ = t, shown shaded in Figure 20.5b. As t is changed, 
the position of the shifted function h(t − λ) changes, the 
product function changes, and so does the area under 
the product from λ = 0 to λ = t.
20.2.2  Procedure Based on Graphical Interpretation
Figure 20.5b forms the basis for the graphical evalua-
tion of the convolution integral. The following steps are 
involved:
	
1.	Express h(t) and x(t) as function of λ.
	
2.	Fold the impulse response around the vertical axis, 
that is, draw it backward as h(−λ).
	
3.	Shift h(−λ) by t to obtain h(t − λ).
	
4.	Determine the area under the product x(λ)h(t − λ) 
over the given range of t. The result is y(t) for this 
range of t.
	
5.	Repeat steps 3 and 4 for various values of t to obtain 
y(t) over the whole range of t.
The preceding procedure is illustrated by Examples 
20.1 and 20.2, which also demonstrate, in principle, how 
convolution can be applied to obtain a circuit response 
due to an excitation that varies arbitrarily with time.

Example 20.1:   Response of RL Circuit 
to a Rectangular Voltage Pulse
Consider the series RL circuit of Figure 20.6a, with R = 1 Ω, 
L = 1 H, zero initial energy storage, and vSRC(t) as the pulse 
shown in Figure 20.6b. It is required to determine i(t) as 
vSRC(t)*h(t), where h(t) is the current response to a unit 
­voltage impulse.
Solution:
h(t) is given by Equation 18.5, with K = 1, L = 1, and 
τ = 1. Replacing t by λ, the impulse response becomes

the expression for h(t − λ)u(t − λ) is the same for any t > 0, 
vSRC(λ) = 2, for 0 < t < 4 s, and vSRC(λ) = 0, for t > 4 s. It

two, in accordance with the time variation of vSRC(λ). The

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The following should be noted concerning this integral:
	
1.	The integrand does not have any impulses and is 
finite over the range of t from t = 0 to t = 4. It follows 
that the lower limit of integration could be 0− or 0+, 
and the upper limit of integration could be 4− or 4+, 
without affecting the value of the integral, since the 
product of a finite quantity and an infinitesimal 
interval is zero. The range of integration can there-
fore be considered as 0 ≤ t ≤ 4 s. Ranges of t will 
henceforth be considered inclusive of the lower and 
upper limits unambiguously, without specifying 
(limit)− and (limit)+ when no impulses are included 
in the integrand. In the presence of impulses, the 
ranges should be specified more carefully.
	
2.	By definition of u(t), u(0+) = 1 and u(0−) = 0 (Equation 
18.5). It follows that over the range of integration 
from λ = 0 to λ just less than t, u(t − λ) = 1, whereas 
outside the integration range, when λ just exceeds t, 
u(t − λ) = 0. This means that u(t − λ) in Equation 
20.10 is redundant and can be ignored. It is helpful 
to remember that u(x) = 1 for x positive and u(x) = 0 
for x negative. u(0) is finite between x  =  0− and 
x = 0+. The integral of a finite integrand between 
infinitesimal limits is zero. So when the integrand is 
finite, it can be assumed that u(x) = 0 for x negative and 
u(x) = 1 for x zero or positive.

The complete response i(t) is i(t) = iʹ(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 4 s, and 
i(t) = i″(t) for t ≥ 4 s, as shown by the simulation plot of 
Figure 20.10. The following should be noted concerning 
Equations 20.11 and  20.12:
	
1.	The integrand is the same in both cases but the upper 
limit is different, which makes the integrals different.
	
2.	iʹ(t) and i″(t) have the same value at t = 4 s, although the 
voltage pulse is, strictly speaking, undefined at t = 4 s. 
Mathematically, this is because the integral of a finite 
integrand between two infinitesimally separated lim-
its is zero (Equation 18.22), so that the integral is the 
same at t = 4− s as at t = 4+ s. This justifies the inclusive 
limits, t ≤ 4 s and t ≥ 4 s. The lower inclusive limit 
0 ≤ t in Equation 20.11 is similarly justified, in the 
absence of an impulse at the origin.
It is instructive to derive i(t) as the response to 
two step functions: 2u(t), starting at the origin, and 
−2u(t − 4), which is a negative, delayed step stating at 
t = 4 s (Figure 20.8). When these two steps are added, 
the result is a pulse of 2 V amplitude and 4 s duration 
(Figure 20.6b). The response to 2u(t) is obtained from 
Equation 11.57, with an initial value i(0+) = 0 and a final 
value iF = 2 A and τ = 1 s. This gives Equation 20.11 as 
the response for 0 ≤ t ≤ 4 s. The response to the nega-
tive step is obtained by noting that since the circuit 
is LTI, time invariance implies that delaying the input simply 
delays the response by the same interval. The response to 
the ­negative delayed step is therefore -

A. By 
superposition, the response for t ≥ 4 s is the sum of this

two responses gives the response of Equation 20.12.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as in Figure 20.9. 
The voltage source is the pulse source VPULSE having 
the  parameters shown. In the simulation profile, Time 
domain (Transient) analysis is selected, 10s is entered 
for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving data after’, and 1ms 
for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simulation is run, 
the graph of Figure 20.10 is displayed, showing the cur-
rents during each of the integration intervals, as given by 
Equations 20.11 and 20.12. The source voltage has been 
added for convenience.

Example 20.2:   Response of RL Circuit 
to a Trapezoidal Voltage Pulse
Consider the same series RL circuit of Example 20.1 but 
with vSRC(t) as in Figure 20.11. It is required to determine 
i(t) as vSRC(t)*h(t).
Solution:
h(t) is the same as before, and the folded impulse response 
is given by Equation 20.8 and shown in Figure 20.12a.
The next step is to form the product function 
vSRC(λ)h(t − λ)u​(t − λ) and determine the area under the 
­product for different values of the shift t. Considering the 
first range of t, the shifted function h(t − λ) u(t − λ) is shown 
in Figure 20.12b, having the vertical edge located at λ = t. 
The product vSRC(λ)h(t − λ)u(t − λ) is 2h(t − λ)​u(t − λ). Denoting 
the convolution integral y(t) in this range by iʹ, it follows 
that iʹ is the area under the product 2h(t − λ)u(t − λ) from 
λ = 0 to λ = t. This area is shown shaded in Figure 20.12b 
and is obtained analytically as

is as shown in Figure 20.13. This function is multiplied 
by vSRC(λ) = (6 − λ) over the interval 4 ≤ t ≤ 6 s. Note that 
although t is restricted to the range between 4 and 6 s, the con-
volution integral is with respect to λ and starts from λ = 0, in

The complete response i is the convolution integral i as 
a function of t. It is given by iʹ, i″, and i‴ over the respec-
tive time intervals, as shown in the simulation plot of 
Figure 20.15. Note that i and its first derivative are con-
tinuous at the breakpoints t = 4 s and t = 6 s. The conti-
nuity of i follows from the fact that the current through 
the inductor is not being forced to change. The  conti-
nuity of di/dt follows from Kirchhoff’s voltage law: 
vSRC(t) = Ri + Ldi/dt. Since vSRC and i are continuous at 
the breakpoints, then di/dt is continuous at these points.
Note that Equations 20.13 and 20.14 give the same 
value at t = 4 s. Similarly, Equations 20.14 and 20.15 give 
the same value at t = 6 s. This serves as a check on the 
convolution integral.
Simulation: The circuit is entered as illustrated in 
Figure 20.14. The voltage source is the piecewise-linear 
VPWL having the parameters shown. In the simulation 
profile, Time domain (Transient) analysis is selected, 10 s 
is entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving data after’, 
and 0.5s for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simulation 
is run, the graph of Figure 20.15 is displayed showing 
the source voltage and the three currents during each of 
the integration intervals.
Problem-Solving Tip

the common limits of consecutive ranges of t.

20.3  Operational Properties of Convolution
The convolution integral is not restricted to the interpre-
tation of Figure 20.3 in terms of the impulse response. 
It is in fact encountered in other contexts, such as prob-
ability theory. In such cases, the convolution integral 
is to be regarded simply as a mathematical operation 
on two functions of time, which may be denoted as 
f(t) and g(t), which need not be interpreted in terms of 
the input to a system and its impulse response. This 
is illustrated by Example 20.3 and is used in the fol-
lowing discussion on the operational properties of 
convolution.

x(t) can be interchanged without affecting the convolu-
tion integral.

Equation 20.23 can be easily proved using the 
Laplace transform for functions that are zero for 
t < 0 (Equation 21.98). Its general proof in the time 
domain for functions that are not zero for t < 0 will 
not be given here. This property is useful in deriving 
the convolution integral for functions involving lin-
ear segments and step discontinuities, as illustrated 
by Example 20.5.
Example 20.3:  Convolution of Ramp 
and Cosine Functions
Convolve the two functions f(t) = tu(t) and g(t) = costu(t).
Solution:
Since the two functions are zero for t < 0, the lower limit of 
integration is zero and the upper limit is t. As there is no 
impulse at the origin, a lower limit of 0 is the same as 0−. 
The first step is to replace t by λ as the integration vari-
able, because t will be the variable in the resulting expres-
sion for the convolution integral. The functions become 
f(λ) = λu(λ) and g(λ) = cosλu(λ). The next step is to replace 
λ by (t − λ) in one of the functions. It does not matter in 
which function this replacement is made because of the 
commutative property of the convolution integral. We 
will choose for illustration the replacement of λ by (t − λ) 
in the cosine function. The convolution integral becomes

20.4  Special Cases of Convolution
20.4.1  Convolution of Staircase Functions
A function of finite magnitude and duration can in 
general be approximated by a series of steps at regular 
intervals of time (Figure 20.17), the smaller the interval, 
the better is the approximation. Such a stepped func-
tion is a staircase function. The convolution integral 
of two staircase functions is a piecewise-linear function 
consisting of a series of straight line segments, as will 
be demonstrated in this section. Analytically, the con-
volution of two such functions reduces to multiplica-
tion of two polynomials and can be readily performed 
using MATLAB’s ‘conv’ command, as illustrated by 
Example 20.4. This can be useful in practice, as when 
the functions are derived experimentally and cannot be 
expressed analytically.
Example 20.4:   Convolution of Staircase Functions
It is required to convolve f t( ) and g t( ) of Figure 20.18. 
Such functions, which consist essentially of a series of 
rectangles, can be used to illustrate the convolution of 
staircase functions. Convolving rectangular functions is 
particularly simple, as is demonstrated in this example.
Solution:
The usual procedure based on the graphical interpreta-
tion is applied for the sake of illustration. The functions

are first expressed in terms of λ. Either f(λ) or g(λ) may 
be folded and shifted by t. f(λ) will be folded and shifted 
in this example. It is generally advisable to fold and shift 
the simpler function, having the fewer number of dis-
tinct ranges of values, or to fold and shift a function that 
starts at a negative time.
Because of the discrete steps in the two functions, 
there are several ranges of t to consider:
	 (a)	 0 ≤ t ≤ 1: Figure 20.19a shows f(−λ) shifted to the 
right by t. Over the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the magnitude 
of f(−λ) is 2 and that of g(λ) is also 2. The area under 
the product is 4t, which is linear in t and varies 
from 0 at t = 0 to 4 at t = 1. Because of this linear-
ity, no formal integration need be performed. y(t) 
over this range is a line that joins the origin, when 
t = 0 and y(0) = 0, to the point y(1) = 4 at t = 1, as 
shown in Figure 20.22. Hence, the value of the area 
under the product need only be determined for the two 
end values of t in the given range. When t = 0, there is 
no overlap between f(−λ) and g(λ), and the product 
is zero. When t = 1, Figure 20.19b applies, and the 
area under the product is 4 × 1 = 4.
	 (b)	  1 ≤ t ≤ 2: The linear variation of area with the shift 
of t applies no matter how many rectangles are 
involved. Linearity applies to every pair of rectan-
gles that are being multiplied together, and the sum 
of the linear functions is still linear in t. The situa-
tion when 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 is shown in Figure 20.20a. There 
are three rectangular areas involved in this case: (i) 
for the rectangles between 0 and (t − 1), the area 
is (−1) × 2 × (t − 1) = 2 − 2t; (ii) for the rectangles 
between (t − 1) and 1, the area is 2 × 2 × (1 − (t − 1)) = 
4(2 − t) = 8 − 4t; and (iii) for the rectangles between 1 
and t, the area is 2 × 3 × (t − 1) = 6t − 6. Each of these 
areas is linear in t. When added together, the sum is 
4, which happens to be independent of t in this case. 
Thus, when t  =  1, Figure 20.19b applies, and the 
area is 4. When t = 2, the area is (−1) × 2 + 2 × 3 = 4 
(Figure 20.20b). It follows that y(t) remains at 4 from 
t = 1 to t = 2, as shown in Figure 20.22. Thus, the 
area need only be calculated at the two boundary 
values of t, that is, at t = 1 and t = 2 in this case. In 
what follows, only the areas at the boundary values 
of t will be calculated.
	 (c)	  2 ≤ t ≤ 3: When t = 3, Figure 20.20c applies, and the 
total area under the product is (−1) × 3 × 1 + 1 × 2 × 
1 = −1. y(t) changes from 4 at t = 2 to −1 at t = 3 
(Figure 20.22).
	 (d)	  3 ≤ t ≤ 4: When t = 4, Figure 20.21a applies, and the 
total area under the product is (−1) × 1 × 1 = −1. 
Hence, y(t) remains at −1 from t  =  3 to t  =  4 
(Figure 20.22).
	 (e)	  4 ≤ t ≤ 5: When t = 5, Figure 20.21b applies and the 
product becomes zero, because there is no overlap 
between the two functions.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The convolution integral y t( ) is shown in Figure 20.22.
To use MATLAB for convolving two staircase functions, 
two polynomials representing f(t) and g(t) are formed. The 
independent variable of the polynomial is arbitrary but 
will be kept as t, since this is the argument of y(t). However, 
capital letters are used for the polynomials in order to dis-
tinguish the polynomial from the given function. The coef-
ficients of the powers of t in a polynomial are equal to the 
various levels of the respective staircase function, in the 
order of decreasing powers t, with the last nonzero level in 
the positive direction of the time variable t of the function 
being the constant term of the polynomial. Thus, since f(t) 
in Figure 20.18 consists of two levels, the first level is the 
coefficient of t in the polynomial in t and the second level is 
the constant term. The polynomial is written as F(t) = 2t − 1. 
G(t) consists of three levels: the first level is the coefficient 
of t2, the second level is the coefficient of t, and the third 
level is the constant term. The polynomial is written as 
G(t) = 2t2 + 3t + 1. The product of the two polynomials will 
be denoted by B(t), the breakpoint polynomial, given by
	 B t

It is seen that the coefficients of B(t) are the values of y(t) 
at the successive nonzero breakpoints between the first 
and last zero values of y(t). Note that B(t) is not the same 
as y(t), the convolution integral. B(t) is just a polynomial 
whose coefficients give the nonzero breakpoints of y(t).
The multiplication of large polynomials is facilitated 
by MATLAB’s ‘conv’ command. If we enter the coeffi-
cients of F(x) and G(x) as arrays,
>> F = [2 –1]
>> G = [2 3 1]
followed by the command:
>> Y = conv(F, G)
MATLAB returns
Y = 
4    4    –1    –1
corresponding to the values of y(t) at the successive non-
zero breakpoints, between the first and last zero values 
of y(t).
When deriving the convolution integral as the prod-
uct of two polynomials, the following should be noted:
	 (a)	 It is assumed that unit time intervals are used. When 
the time intervals are not unity, the intervals should be 
scaled to unity, but the values of the function should 
also be scaled so as to keep the same area under the 
product of the functions (see Problem P20.26).
	 (b)	 It is most convenient to assume that both staircase 
functions start at t = 0. If that is not the case, the 
functions are advanced or delayed so as to make 
them start at t = 0, then the convolution integral is 
shifted back by an amount that is opposite that of 
the total net shift of the two functions. This is illus-
trated by problems at the end of the chapter.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 It is generally advisable to fold and shift the sim-
pler function, having the fewer number of distinct 
ranges of values, or to fold and shift a function that 
starts at negative time.
20.4.2  Convolution with Impulse Function
It is required to convolve a function x(t)u(t) with δ(t), 
a unit impulse at the origin (Figure 20.23a). When t is

an impulse at the origin because δ(t) is an even func-
tion (Equation 18.8). When shifted by t to the right 
(Figure 20.23b), it becomes δ(t − λ). This is the same as 
δ(λ − t), because of the evenness of the impulse function.

It is assumed that x(λ) does not have an impulse at 
the origin, so that the lower limit of integration could 
be unambiguously 0, as explained in connection with 
Equation 20.5. The integrand is nonzero over the dura-
tion of the impulse from λ = t− to λ = t+. Assuming that 
the function is continuous at λ = t, this value is substi-
tuted for λ in x(λ)u(λ), as usual in evaluating expressions 
involving impulses. The term x(t) is a constant as far as 
the integration with respect to λ is concerned and can 
be taken outside the integral. Since u(λ)  =  1 over the 
range of integration, with t positive, u(λ) is redundant 
in the integrand. Equation 20.27 becomes

(20.29)
It is seen that convolution of a function with a unit 
impulse at the origin is the function itself, for t  >  0, 
assuming the function is continuous over the given 
range of t.
In terms of the graphical interpretation of Figure 20.23, 
recall that multiplying a continuous function x(λ) by an 
impulse at time λ = t makes the impulse “sample” the 
function at this instant, that is, return the value of the 
function x(t) as the strength of the impulse x(t)δ(λ − t) at 
time t. The area under this product, over the duration of 
the impulse, is x(t). Hence, as t is increased from zero, 
the function is “swept” by the impulse, resulting in x(t) 
over the range of the given function.
Equation 20.29 can be interpreted in terms of the 
commutative property of convolution. Thus, δ(t) can 
be considered as an input and x(t) as the response 
to δ(t). Equation 20.29 is simply an expression of the 
fact that if the input is an impulse δ(t), the response is 
­evidently x(t).
To appreciate the significance of convolution with an 
impulse, suppose that the impulse is delayed by a > 0, 
while x(t) remains as it was (Figure 20.24a). Replacing 
t  by λ, the functions become x(λ) and δ(λ − a). When 
the impulse function is folded and shifted to the right 
by t, λ is replaced by (t − λ) so that the impulse function 
becomes δ(t − λ − a) (Figure 20.24b). Since the impulse 
function is even, the argument can be negated, without 
changing the value of the function. Thus, δ(t − λ − a) = 
δ(λ − t  +  a)  = δ(λ − (t − a)). The convolution integral 
becomes

The integrand is nonzero over the duration of the

the function is continuous at λ = t − a, this value is sub-
stituted for λ in the expression x(λ)u(λ), as usual in eval-
uating expressions involving impulses, to give x(t − a)​
u(t − a); x(t − a) is a constant as far as integration with 
respect to λ is concerned and can be taken outside the 
integral. u(t − a) = 1 for t > a. Equation 20.30 becomes

It is seen that convolution of a function with a 
delayed impulse delays the function by the delay of the 
impulse. This result can be interpreted along the same 
lines as in Figure 20.23. The difference is that the given

of the impulse. This means that the function that is 
returned by the convolution integral is the given func-
tion delayed by a.
The next step is to generalize convolution with an 
impulse to the case where the impulse is delayed 
by a > 0 and the function x(t) is delayed by b > 0. The 
delayed function is considered as x(t − b)u(t − b) and not 
as x(t − b)u(t), which in general is a different function 
altogether. To appreciate the difference, consider the 
function x(t)u(t), with x(t) = t, as in Figure 20.25a. The 
extension of x(t) = t to t < 0 is shown in dashed line. If 
x(t) is delayed by b > 0 and multiplied by u(t), the result-
ing function is shown as the solid line in Figure 20.25b. 
On the other hand, if the delayed function x(t − b) is 
multiplied by the delayed step function u(t − b), then the 
­function of Figure 20.25a is delayed as is by b, as shown 
in Figure 20.25c. In other words, x(t − b)u(t − b) = 0 for 
t < b and is x(t − b) for t > b, just as the function x(t)u(t) = 0 
for t < 0 and is x(t) for t > 0.
The function x(t)u(t) of Figure 20.23a is shown as a 
delayed function x(t − b)u(t − b) in Figure 20.26a, together 
with the delayed impulse δ(t − a). When t is replaced 
by λ, and the impulse is folded around the vertical axis 
and shifted by t to the right, λ is replaced by (t − λ) so 
that the impulse becomes δ(t − λ − a) (Figure 20.26b). 
Since the impulse function is even, the argument can 
be negated, without changing the value of the function. 
Thus, δ(t − λ − a) = δ(λ − t + a) = δ(λ − (t − a)). The convo-
lution integral becomes

There is no overlap if t < (b + a). The integrand is non-
zero over the duration of the impulse, from λ = (t − a)− to 
λ = (t − a)+. Assuming that the function is continuous 
at λ = t − a, this value is substituted for λ in the expres-
sion x(λ − b)u(λ − b), as usual in evaluating expressions 
involving impulses. The terms x(λ − b)u(λ − b) in the inte-
grand become x(t − a − b)u(t − a − b). The term x(t − a − b) 
is a constant as far as integration with respect to λ is con-
cerned and can be taken outside the integral. The step 
function u(t − a − b) is redundant since its argument is

In effect, as t increases beyond (a  +  b), the impulse 
sweeps over the x(λ − b)u(λ − b) function, returning the 
values of the function x(t − b), but after a further delay a.
Concept: Convolving a function with a unit impulse delays 
the function by the delay of the unit impulse, assuming the 
function to be continuous over given range of the shift t.
Note that whereas multiplication of a function by a 
unit impulse samples the function at the time of occur-
rence of the impulse (Example 18.1), convolving the 
function with a unit impulse delays the function by 
the delay of the impulse. If the unit impulse occurs at 
the origin, the function is unaltered.

20.4.3  Convolution with Step Function
It is required to convolve a function x(t)u(t) with u(t), 
a unit step function at the origin. If t is replaced by λ, 
and u(λ) is folded around the vertical axis, the func-
tions become as shown in Figure 20.27. When u(−λ) is 
shifted to the right by t, it becomes u(t − λ). The product 
x(λ)u(λ)u(t − λ) is the part of the function x(λ) between 0 
and t. The area under the product, which is the convolu-
tion integral, is the shaded area. It is seen that this area is 
simply the integral of x(λ) between 0 and t. Thus,

Suppose that u(t) is delayed by a  >  0, which is the 
same as shifting u(t) to the right by a, so it becomes 
u(t − a) (Figure 20.28a). Suppose that the function x(t) 
is delayed by b > 0 (Figure 20.28a) to become x(t − b)​
u(t − b), as in Figure 20.28a. When t is replaced by λ, and 
the step function u(λ − a) is folded around the vertical 
axis and shifted by t to the right, λ is replaced by (t − λ) 
so that the step function becomes u(t − λ − a). It is seen 
from Figure 20.28b that if t < (a + b), there is no overlap 
between the functions u(t − λ − a) and x(λ − b)u(λ − b), 
so that the product is zero. The product is nonzero only 
for t > (a + b). The convolution integral is the shaded 
area under the product and is given by

u(λ − b) in the integrand is redundant, because it is 
zero for λ < b, and the lower limit of integration is b, 
anyway. With t > (a + b), it follows that t − a > b, so that 
the step function is unity over the range of integration. 
The restriction that t > (a + b) can be accounted for by 
multiplying the integral by u(t − a − b). Equation 20.37

The following concept applies:
Concept: Convolving a function with a unit step is equiva-
lent to integrating the function and delaying it by the delay of 
the unit step. The range of integration is from the start of the 
function to a value of the time variable λ that is t minus the 
delay of the unit step.
If the unit step occurs at the origin, the function is 
­integrated up to t, as in Equation 20.36. Example 20.5 
illustrates convolution with step and impulse functions, 
as well as Equation 20.23.

★20.4.4  Implications of Impulse Response
Convolution with impulse and step functions can be 
interpreted in terms of system memory and distortion. 
Consider Figure 20.32a, which is essentially the same 
as Figure 20.4. Recall that in evaluating the convolution 
integral at time t, a narrow-pulse constituent of the input 
such as x(λi) at λ = λi, shown in gray in Figure 20.32a, is 
interpreted as an impulse, and its contribution to the 
output at t is evaluated by multiplying x(λi) by the value 
of the impulse response h(t − λi), at a time (t − λi) after 
the start of the impulse response. Time t can be inter-
preted as the “present instant” at which the convolu-
tion integral, or output, is desired. Pulses occurring at 
λ > t are “future” inputs that have not yet occurred. As 
pointed out earlier, the contributions of these pulses to

the present input are excluded by taking t as the upper 
limit of the convolution integral, on the basis that phys-
ical systems operating in real time are causal, that is, 
they do not anticipate, and hence do not respond, to an 
input before it occurs.
Pulses occurring at λ < t are “past” inputs whose contri-
butions are summed by the integration to obtain the total 
response at time t. The contributions of these pulses are 
weighted by the impulse response h(t − λi). It is seen from 
Figure 20.32a that this weighting depends on the shape 
of the impulse response. Because of the exponential 
decay of the impulse response shown, pulses occurring 
over part ‘ab’, shown crossed in Figure 20.32a, have more 
weight than pulses occurring earlier in time, over the part 
‘bc’. The contributions of pulses occurring at λ < t can 
be interpreted as a kind of “memory” possessed by the 
circuit, in the sense that past inputs are not “f­orgotten”, 
since they affect the output at the present time t. If the 
impulse response is itself an impulse (Figure 20.32b), 
the circuit is “memoryless” in the sense that the present 
output depends only on the present input. On the other 
hand, a circuit whose impulse response is a step function 
(Figure 20.32c) has “perfect memory” in the sense that 
past inputs are not only remembered, but their contribu-
tions to the present input are equally weighted.
It may be wondered as to the kind of circuit that is 
memoryless or has perfect memory. If we consider a 
unit impulse of current δ(t) applied to a resistor R, the 
voltage response is h(t)  =  Rδ(t), as in Figure 20.32b. 
An  ideal resistor is therefore memoryless, and by 
extension, purely resistive circuits are memoryless as 
well. On the other hand, if a unit impulse of current 
δ(t) is applied to a capacitor C, the voltage response is

, which is a step function, 
as shown in Figure 20.32c. An ideal capacitor therefore 
has perfect memory, and by extension, purely capacitive 
circuits have perfect memory as well.
Another implication of the impulse response is that 
if this response is an impulse at the origin, the output 
is the same as the input, but scaled by the strength of 
the impulse (Equation 20.29). The output is therefore an 
undistorted form of the input, where distortion refers 
to deviation of the output waveform from that of the 
input. If the impulse response is a delayed impulse, 
the output is also undistorted but is delayed with 
respect to the input (Equation 20.32). In the frequency 
domain, a distortionless delay is produced by circuits 
­having a magnitude response that is independent of 
frequency and a phase shift that is directly proportional 
to frequency (Equation 23.32). On the other hand, if the 
impulse response is a step function, the output wave-
form is highly distorted by the integration of the input 
(Equation 20.38).
In conclusion, the larger the deviation of the impulse 
response of a circuit from an impulse, the more substan-
tial is the circuit memory and the larger is the distortion 
of the output, compared to the input.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
20.5  Some General Properties 
of the Convolution Integral
We will summarize in what follows some general prop-
erties of the convolution integral that can serve as a 
guide to its derivation and a check on its correctness.
Property 1: If both functions being convolved start with 
finite or zero values, the convolution integral starts with a 
zero value, at a value of t when overlap between the two func-
tions is just about to begin.
Thus, the two functions convolved in Examples 20.1, 
20.2, and 20.4 both start with finite values at t = 0+. The 
convolution integrals y(t) in Figures 20.10, 20.14, and 
20.22 all start at the origin. This follows from the fact that 
if one function is folded, without shift (t = 0), it extends 
from the origin in the negative direction of λ, whereas 
the other function extends from the origin in the posi-
tive direction of λ. The two functions do not overlap for 
t < 0, but overlap for t > 0. Hence, y(t) also starts at the ori-
gin. In Example 20.5, v
t
SRC
1( ) ( ) has an impulse at the origin, 
whereas h
t
-
(
)( )
1
 starts with a zero value at the origin. y(t) 
starts at the origin (Figure 20.31) because the product of 
an impulse and zero is zero (Example 18.1). Had h
t
-
(
)( )
1
 
started with a finite value, then y(t) would have started 
with a finite value.
Property 2: If both functions being convolved end with a 
value of zero, the convolution integral also ends with a value 
zero, at a finite value of t when there is no longer any overlap 
between the two functions.
In Example 20.4, both functions end with a zero value. 
y(t) ends with a zero value. In Examples 20.1 and 20.2, 
h(t) theoretically extends to infinity, so that y(t) also 
extends to infinity.
Property 3: If both functions being convolved are of finite 
duration, the duration of the convolution integral is the sum 
of the durations of the two functions.
Thus, f(t) and g(t) in Figure 20.18 are of durations of 
two and three units, respectively. The duration of the 
convolution integral in Figure 20.22 is five units. The 
justification follows from Figure 20.21b. The overlap 
between the two functions just ends, and y(t) becomes 
zero, for a value of t that is the sum of the durations of 
the two functions.
Property 4: Delaying one or both functions being convolved 
delays the start of the convolution integral by an interval that 
is the sum of the delays of the two functions.
In Equation 20.35, the convolution integral is delayed 
by the sum of the delays of x(t) and the impulse f­unction, 
until overlap just begins. Similarly, in Equation 20.38, 
the convolution integral is delayed by the sum of the 
delays of x(t) and the step function.
Examples 20.6 and 20.8 illustrate convolution with 
a function that starts at a finite negative time. In such 
cases, the negative value of t at which a function starts 
is effectively a “negative delay”. Moreover, the time-­
invariant property of LTI systems can be invoked in 
these cases, as illustrated by Example 20.6.
Example 20.6:   Convolution of Pulse with Itself
f(t) in Figure 20.33a is usually denoted as Arect(t/τ). It is 
required to derive the convolution integral of f(t) when 
convolved with itself.
Solution:
Method 1: When t is replaced by λ, and f(λ) is folded around 
the vertical axis, its waveform does not change because 
of its even symmetry. The product is [Arect(t/τ)]2 and the 
area under the product is A2τ. Evidently, this is the maxi-
mum value of the convolution integral, for any shift to the 
right or left reduces the area under the product.
Because f(t) starts with a finite value at t = −τ/2, the 
convolution integral must start at zero, with no overlap. 
In order for overlap to just begin, the folded function 
should be shifted to the left by τ (Figure 20.33b), that is, 
t = −τ. For −τ ≤ t ≤ 0, the shifted function is shown in 
Figure 20.34a. The convolution function y(t) is reduced 
from its maximum value of A2τ by the product area A2t. 
The area under the product becomes A2(t + τ), −τ ≤ t ≤ 0, 
which is the equation of a straight line of slope 1 and 
which intersects the time axis at t = −τ. Thus, y(t) = A2τ for 
t = 0 and decreases linearly to zero at t = −τ (Figure 20.35).

Note that the leading edge of the folded and shifted func-
tion is at τ/2 − (−t) = τ/2 + t, −τ ≤ t ≤ 0, and its trailing 
edge is at τ/2 + t − τ = −τ/2 + t. The convolution integral

If the folded function is shifted to the right by t, 
the area under the product is also reduced until there 
is no longer any overlap at t  =  τ (Figure 20.34b). For 
0 ≤ t ≤ τ, the maximum area is reduced by A2t, so that 
y(t) = A2(−t + τ), which is the equation of a straight line 
of slope − 1 and which intersects the time axis at t = τ. 
It is seen that y(t) = A2τ for t = 0 and decreases linearly 
to zero at t = τ (Figure 20.35). The leading edge of the 
folded and shifted function is at τ/2 + t, 0 ≤ t ≤ τ, and 
its trailing edge is at τ/2 + t − τ = −τ/2 + t, the same 
as for negative t, since t is a variable that can assume 
positive or negative values, so that as a symbol t can be 
treated like a positive number. The convolution integral

Method 2: Let f(t) be shifted by τ/2 to the right, so that 
it starts at the origin (Figure 20.36a). When t is replaced 
by λ, and f(λ) is folded around the vertical axis, the right-
hand vertical edge of f(−λ) coincides with the vertical 
axis, so that no overlap occurs at t = 0 between f(λ) and 
f(−λ). The  convolution integral y(t) starts from zero at 
t = 0. When the folded function is shifted by t to the right, 
0 ≤ t ≤ τ (Figure 20.36b), the area under the product is A2t 
and reaches a maximum value of A2τ at t = τ. For τ ≤ t ≤ 2τ 
(Figure 20.36c), the area under the product is y(t) = A2(τ − 
(t − τ)) = A2(2τ − t). y(t) decreases linearly from A2τ at t = τ 
to zero at t = 2τ (Figure 20.36d).
Since the system is an LTI, then shifting the input by a 
certain time interval shifts the output by the same time 
interval. If f(t) in Figure 20.36a is shifted to the left by 
τ/2, it becomes as in Figure 20.33a. But since the func-
tion is convolved with itself, this means that two input 
functions are each shifted to the left by τ/2. The output 
is shifted to the left by τ. If y(t) in Figure 20.36d is shifted 
to the left by 2(τ/2) = τ, it becomes as in Figure 20.35.
An important consideration in convolution based on 
the graphical procedure is identifying the consecutive 
ranges of t of the convolution integral. In general, a dis-
tinct range of t of the convolution integral is defined by 
the following:
	
1.	The integrands of the convolution integral 
are the same over the given range of t, but are 
­different from those of the preceding range of t 
or the following range of t, where an integrand 
is the product, over the range, of the unshifted 
function and the folded and shifted function
	
2.	The integrands of the convolution integral are 
the same as those of a preceding range of t, or 
a following range of t, but the integration limits 
are different.
As mentioned previously, a useful test for the correct-
ness of the ranges of t is to verify that the convolution 
integral has the same value for values of t that are com-
mon between successive ranges of t. The following two 
examples illustrate these points.
Example 20.7:   Convolution of Pulse 
with Two Half-Sinusoids
It is required to derive the convolution integral of the 
functions f(t) and g(t) in Figure 20.37, where g(t) = 2sinπt,

Solution: 
After replacing t in the given functions by λ, f(λ) is 
folded and shifted to the right by t. The first range of t 
is 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s (Figure 20.38a). Over this range, the prod-
uct of f(t − λ) and g(λ) has the same expression, but this 
expression is different from that for t > 1. The convolu-

y3(t) is independent of t over this range. Note that the 
integrands in Equations 20.44 and 20.45 are the same, 
but the upper integration limit of the second integral is 
different. This gives a different convolution integral and 
hence defines a distinct range of t.
As f(t − λ) is shifted further to the right, the next range 
of t is that for which the trailing edge of f(t − λ), at (t − 3), 
is between 0 and 1 (Figure 20.39b), that is, 3 ≤ t ≤ 4 s. Over 
this range, the product of f(t − λ) and g(λ) has the same 
integrands as in Equation 20.45 but a different lower 
limit of the first integral. The convolution integral is

The end values are y5(4) = 4/π and y5(5) = 0. For t ≥ 5, 
the there is no overlap and y(t)  =  0. The convolution 
integral y(t) is shown in Figure 20.40b.
In convolving functions starting at a finite negative 
time, specifying the different ranges of t of the convolu-
tion integral is considerably facilitated by identifying a 
part of the function whose abscissa has the same value as 
the shift in t. This is illustrated by the following example.
Example 20.8:  Convolution of Triangular 
and Biphasic Pulses
It is required to derive the convolution integral of the 
functions f(t) and g(t) shown in Figure 20.41.
Solution:
g(t) extends into negative time. When t is replaced by 
λ, and g(λ) is folded around the vertical axis, its wave-
form does not change because of its even symmetry 
(Figure 20.42a). For t = 0, that is, without any shift of g(−λ), 
the product g(−λ)f(λ) ≠ 0, and the convolution integral 
y(0) is the shaded area under the product, which is 0.5. 
This is not the start of the convolution integral, because 
when the two functions being convolved start with zero 
or finite values, the convolution integral should start with 
a zero value, corresponding to no overlap between the 
unshifted function and the other function that has been 
folded. These functions just overlap if g(−λ) is shifted to 
the left by 1 s (Figure 20.42b). Note that the λ-coordinate 
of the vertex of the shifted function g(t − λ) is equal to the 
shift: with no shift (t = 0), the vertex is on the vertical axis 
(λ = 0), whereas with a shift of t = −1, the λ-coordinate of 
the vertex is −1. Hence, the amount of shift is the same 
as the λ-coordinate of the vertex. The leading endpoint 
of g(t − λ) is at λ = (t + 1) and its trailing endpoint is at 
λ = (t − 1). Note that in terms of t as a symbol, the coor-
dinates of the vertex and the two endpoints are the same 
for any shift of t, positive or negative.
The convolution integral y(t) is obtained by increas-
ing t over consecutive ranges until there is no overlap 
between f(λ) and g(t − λ). As g(t − λ) in Figure 20.42b is 
shifted to the right, the first range of t is when the vertex 
is between λ = −1 and λ = 0 or when the leading end-
point, t + 1, is between λ = 0 and λ = 1 (Figure 20.43a). 
That is, 0 ≤ t + 1 ≤ 1 or −1 ≤ t ≤ 0. Over this range, f(λ) = 1

sloping line. This equation is most easily obtained by 
noting that the slope of the line is −1, and its ordinate is 
zero at λ = (t + 1). The product has the same expression

This is in fact the area (t + 1)2/2 of a right isosceles tri-
angle having a side (t + 1). The end values are y1(−1) = 0 
and y1(0) = 0.5 (Table 20.1).
As g(t − λ) is shifted further to the right, the next 
range of t is that when the vertex is between λ = 0 and 
λ = 1 or the leading endpoint, t + 1, is between λ = 1 and 
λ = 2 (Figure 20.43b). That is, 1 ≤ t + 1 ≤ 2 or 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. 
Over this range, the product of f(λ) and g(t − λ) has the 
same expression, but this expression is different from 
that for (t + 1) < 1 or for (t + 1) > 2. The equation of the 
positively sloping line is g(t − λ) = (λ − t + 1). The slope 
of the line is +1 and its ordinate is zero at λ = (t − 1).

Note that, geometrically, the area under the product 
is the algebraic sum of areas of the three figures: (i) a 
trapezoid of width t and of sides 1 and (1 − t) (this area 
is t(2 − t)/2 = t − t2/2); (ii) a trapezoid of width (1 − t) 
and of sides 1 and (1 − (1 − t)) = t (this area is (1 + t)
(1 − t)/2 = 1/2 − t2/2); and (iii) a right isosceles trian-
gle of side t and area t2/2. Adding the positive areas of 
the trapezoids to the negative area of the triangle gives 
the same area as in Equation 20.49. The end values are 
y2(0) = 0.5 and y2(1) = 0 (Table 20.1). It should also be 
noted that the equations of the two lines in terms of t as 
a symbol are the same for all ranges of t.
As g(t − λ) is shifted further to the right, the next 
range of t is that when the vertex is between λ  =  1 
and λ = 2 or the trailing endpoint, t − 1, is between 
λ = 0 and λ = 1 (Figure 20.44a). That is, 0 ≤ t − 1 ≤ 1 
or 1 ≤ t ≤ 2. Over this range, the product of f(λ) and

As in the preceding range, the product area can be 
considered the algebraic sum of three areas: (i) the area 
(2 − t)2/2 = 2 − 2t + t2/2 of a right isosceles triangle, 
(ii) the area −(t − 1)(3 − t)/2 = 3/2 − 2t + t2/2 of the trape-
zoid on the left, and (iii) the area −t(2 − t)/2 = −t + t2/2 of 
the trapezoid on the right. The sum of these areas is the 
same as in Equation 20.50. The end values are y3(1) = 0 
and y3(2) = −0.5 (Table 20.1).
As g(t − λ) is shifted further to the right, the next 
range of t is that when the vertex is between λ = 2 and 
λ = 3 or the trailing endpoint, t − 1, is between λ = 1 and

which is the area (3 − t)2/2 of a right isosceles trian-
gle of side (3 − t). The end values are y4(2) = −0.5 and 
y4(3) = 0 (Table 20.1). Beyond t = 3 s, there is no over-
lap, so that y(t) = 0. The convolution integral is plotted 
in Figure 20.45.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 After a function is folded, and if the convolution 
integral is not zero at t = 0, it is advisable to first 
shift the function using a positive value of t, as 
this will easily define the coordinates on the λ-axis 
of the salient features of the folded function, 
such as leading or trailing edges or endpoints. 
The expressions of these coordinates in terms of 
t remain the same for all values of t, positive or 
negative.
Exercise 20.9
Apply time invariance to Example 20.8 by shifting g(t) 
1 s to the right so that it starts at t = 0. Derive the convo-
lution integral and then shift it back 1 s to the left and 
compare with y(t) of Figure 20.45.
Exercise 20.10
Assume that g(t) in Figure 20.41 is as in Figure 20.46. 
When g(λ) is folded around the vertical axis, and shifted 
by t to the right, specify the λ-coordinate of the vertex 
in terms of t so that it gives the correct value of λ when 
t = 0. Note that this expression applies for any shift t.
Ans. λ = t + 3, so that the vertex is at λ = 3 when there 
is no shift (t = 0) and λ = −1 when the triangle is shifted 
4 units to the left (t = −4) so there is no overlap at the 
start of the convolution integral.
Primal Exercise 20.11
Determine the maximum value of the convolution inte-
gral f(t)*g(t) in Figure 20.47 and the time at which it 
occurs.
Ans. 3 units at t = 2 units.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 If a function is shifted to the right along the 
x-axis by a positive number a, the x-axis variable 
in the function is replaced by (x − a). Conversely, 
if a function is shifted to the left along the x-axis 
by a positive number a, the  x-axis variable in 
the function is replaced by (x + a). If the func-
tion is shifted by a variable amount denoted by 
a symbol such as t, which could have positive or 
negative values, the x-axis variable in the func-
tion is replaced by (x − t).
•	 If a function is folded around the y-axis, the 
x-axis variable in the function is negated. If 
the folded function is shifted along the x-axis, 
the same aforementioned rules for shifting 
apply to only the x-axis variable in the function, 
not including any minus sign of this variable.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
•	 The response of an LTI circuit to an arbitrary 
input can be considered as the superposition 
of responses to sufficiently narrow pulses, each 
having an amplitude determined by the input. 
These narrow pulses can be approximated by 
impulses, which naturally leads to a convolu-
tion integral involving the input function and 
the impulse response of the circuit.
•	 The 
convolution 
integral 
that 
is 
con-
ventionally applied in circuit analysis is 
y t
x
h t
d
t
( ) =
( )
-
(

, where t is constant 
with respect to the integration and the integral 
gives the value of the convolution function at t.
•	 The procedure for graphical derivation of the 
convolution integral is as follows:
	
1.	 Express h(t) and x(t) as function of λ.
	
2.	 Fold the impulse response around the verti-
cal axis, that is, draw it backward as h(−λ).
	
3.	 Shift h(−λ) by t to obtain h(t − λ).
	
4.	 Determine the area under the product x(λ)​
h(t − λ) over the given range of t. The result 
is y(t) for this range of t.
	
5.	 Repeat steps 3 and 4 for various values of t 
to obtain y(t) over the whole range of t.
•	 The convolution integral is not restricted to the 
interpretation in terms of the impulse response 
but can be regarded simply as a mathematical 
operation on two functions of time, which may 
be denoted as f(t) and g(t), which need not be 
interpreted in terms of the input to a system and 
its impulse response.
•	 The convolution integral is commutative, 
distributive, associative, and invariant with 
­integration of one function a number of times 
and differentiation of the other function the 
same number of times.
•	 Practical functions may be approximated by stair-
case functions. The convolution integral of two 
staircase functions is a piecewise-linear function 
consisting of a series of straight line segments. 
The breakpoints between these ­segments occur at 
the discrete values of the shift of the folded func-
tion. The value of the convolution integral at each 
breakpoint is equal to the area under the product 
of the unshifted function and the shifted func-
tion, for each discrete shift of the folded function. 
Graphically, this area need only be calculated at 
the boundary values of the discrete shifts, and 
not at intermediate values of the shifts.
	
1.	 Analytically, convolution of staircase ­functions 
reduces to multiplication of two polynomials 
representing the functions being convolved. 
The coefficients of the terms of a given poly-
nomial are equal to the various levels of the 
respective staircase approximation of the 
function, in the order of decreasing power of 
the assigned variable of the polynomial, with 
the last nonzero level in the positive direction 
of the time variable t of the function being the 
constant term of the polynomial. The coeffi-
cients of the terms of the polynomial product 
of the two polynomials are the values of the 
convolution integral at the successive break-
points between the first and last zero values 
of the convolution integral.
•	 Convolving a function with a unit impulse 
delays the function by the delay of the unit 
impulse, assuming the function to be continu-
ous over the given range of the shift t.
•	 Convolving a function with a unit step is equiv-
alent to integrating the function and delaying 
it by the delay of the unit step. The range of 
integration is from the start of the function to 
a value of the time variable λ that is t minus the 
delay of the unit step.
•	 The larger the deviation of the impulse response 
of a circuit from an impulse, the more substan-
tial is the circuit memory and the larger is the 
distortion of the output, compared to the input.
•	 The convolution integral of two functions has 
the following properties:
	
1.	 If both functions being convolved start with 
finite or zero values, the convolution ­integral 
starts with a zero value, at a value of t when 
there is no overlap between the two functions.
	
2.	 If both functions being convolved end with 
a value of zero, the convolution integral also 
ends with a value zero, at a finite value of t 
when there is no longer any overlap between 
the two functions.
	
3.	 If both functions being convolved are of 
finite duration, the duration of the convolu-
tion integral is the sum of the durations of 
the two functions.
	
4.	 Delaying one or both functions being 
­convolved delays the start of the convolu-
tion integral by an interval that is the sum of 
the delays of the two functions.
•	 In general, a distinct range of t of the ­convolution 
integral is defined by the following:
	
1.	 The integrands of the convolution integral are 
the same over the given range, but are dif-
ferent from those of a preceding range of t or 
a following range of t, where an integrand is

the product, over the range, of the unshifted 
function and the folded and shifted function
•	 The integrands of the convolution integral 
are the same as those of a preceding range of 
t, or a following range of t, but the integra-
tion limits are different
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	A simple check on convolution is that the con-
volution integral should have the same value at 
the limits of overlapping ranges of t.
	
2.	It is generally advisable to fold and shift the 
simpler function, having the fewer number of 
distinct ranges of values, or to fold and shift a 
function that starts at negative time.
	
3.	After a function is folded, and if the convolu-
tion integral is not zero at t = 0, it is advisable 
to first shift the function using a positive value 
of t, as this will easily define the coordinates on 
the λ-axis of the salient features of the folded 
function, such as leading or trailing edges or 
endpoints. The expressions of these coordinates 
in terms of t remain the same for all values of t, 
positive or negative.

Objective and Overview
This chapter and the next are concerned with the Laplace 
transform (LT), which provides an extremely powerful 
tool for analyzing linear systems. Recall that the power 
and usefulness of the phasor approach is in transform-
ing linear, ordinary differential equations with constant 
coefficients to algebraic equations for analyzing the sinu-
soidal steady state only. The LT extends this approach by 
transforming linear, ordinary differential equations also 
to algebraic equations, but for deriving the complete 
response, that is, steady-state plus transient. Moreover, 
the excitation is not limited to sinusoidal excitation but 
could be any arbitrary excitation that has an LT.
The present chapter first introduces the LT before pre-
senting its most important properties. This is followed 
by a discussion of the solution of linear, ­ordinary dif-
ferential equations using the LT, and the inversion of 
the LT to obtain the time function. The power of the LT 
method is extended by some useful theorems, which 
are presented and applied at the end of the chapter. 
Of special interest are the initial-value theorem and 
the convolution theorem. The latter theorem provides 
the important link between the convolution integral 
and the LT.
21.1  General
Before defining the LT, the notion of complex frequency 
is explained. A complex frequency s can be expressed as 
the sum of a real component σ and an imaginary compo-
nent jω, that is, s = σ + jω. An s-plane can be postulated 
as an Argand diagram whose real axis is σ and whose 
imaginary axis is jω, as illustrated in Figure 21.1. The 
point ‘P’, for example, having coordinates −2 and 3, rep-
resents a complex frequency s = −2 + j3 rad/s.
We have encountered such a frequency in deriving 
the roots of an underdamped, second-order circuit as 
s1 = −α + jωd and s2 = −α – jωd (Equation 12.20). Both 
s1 and s2 are complex frequencies, where ωd is a physical 
frequency of sinusoidal functions, such as sinωdt and 
cosωdt. On the other hand, α, although having the units 
of frequency, is not a physical frequency in the same 
sense as ωd. Rather, it appears in circuit responses in 
the exponent of the term e−αt. Similarly, in the general 
expression s = σ + jω, ω is a physical frequency of sinu-
soidal functions and σ is a quantity that appears in the 
exponents of exponential terms.
Formally, the LT is a transformation from the time 
domain to the s-domain, which means that a function 
of time, f(t), becomes a function of s, according to some 
defining mathematical relation. Given an arbitrary func-
tion f(t) defined over all time, the general, or two-sided, 
LT of f(t) is defined as

(21.1)
The integral, assuming it exists, is clearly a function 
of s alone. Let the interval from −∞ to +∞ be divided 
into two intervals, one from −∞ to 0−, the other from 
0− to +∞:

In circuit analysis, and for reasons that will become 
clear in the following chapter, a one-sided LT is defined 
as the second integral in Equation 21.2, considering the 
first integral to be zero. This is tantamount to ignoring 
­values of f(t), for t < 0−.

L {f(t)} or F(s). From the preceding discussion,

Concept: In the one-sided LT F(s), values of f(t) for t < 0− 
are ignored.
Specifying the lower limit of integration in Equation 
21.3 as 0− includes in the integration any impulse at the 
origin. This is desirable, because such an impulse is 
commonly encountered in circuit analysis.
Let the interval of integration in Equation 21.3 be 
divided as follows:
	
f t e

(21.4)
According to Equation 18.22, the integral from 0− to 
0+ is zero as long as f(t) remains finite during this inter-
val, as when f(t) does not have an impulse at the origin. 
Hence, Equation 21.4 becomes for a function f(t) that does 
not have an impulse at the origin

(21.5)
In other words, if a function does not have an impulse 
at the origin, although it may have a finite step at the 
origin, the lower limit in the integral for the LT could 
just as well be 0+ instead of 0−. In this case, the LT of 
f(t) is the same as the LT of f(t)u(t), irrespective of the 
lower limit of integration being 0− or 0+ or 0. That is, as 
long as f(t) does not have an impulse at the origin, the 
integral of f(t)u(t) is zero between the two infinitesimal 
limits 0− and 0+. Hence, for a function that does not have 
an impulse at the origin,

The following should be noted concerning the LT:
	
1.	Mathematically, sufficient conditions for the 
existence of the LT are (a) convergence of the 
defining integral of the LT and (b) the func-
tion is piecewise continuous on a finite inter-
val of time for t ≥ 0, which means that f(t)e−st 
is integrable over any such interval of time. 
Functions of interest in circuit analysis nor-
mally possess LTs.
	
2.	Theoretically, σ can be chosen to be greater than 
some constant c so that multiplying f(t) by e−ct 
ensures convergence of the integral, that is, 
gives a finite value of the integral. However, 
some functions, such as tt or etn, increase so rap-
idly with t that tte−σt and etne−σt do not tend to 
zero as t →  ∞, no matter how large is σ. Such 
functions do not have LTs, but generally, are not 
of practical interest.
	
3.	The inverse LT (ILT) transforms the function 
F(s) back to f(t) according to the following inte-
gral relation:

(21.11)
	
	 Because this is integration in the complex 
plane, and requires some specialized pro-
cedures, it is seldom used in practice. Other 
methods, discussed later, are used for invert-
ing the LT.
	
4.	The LT of a given function, as defined by 
Equation 21.5, is unique. Conversely, if two 
functions have the same LT, these functions can-
not differ over any time interval of finite length, 

Properties of the Laplace Transform	
637
although they may differ at isolated points. 
Functions having finite values at isolated points 
in time are not of practical interest.
	
5.	Because F(s) is derived through integration with 
respect to time, its units are those of f(t) multi-
plied by the unit of time used in the integration.
The LT is, in general, derived in the following ways:
	
1.	Direct evaluation of the integral, as in Equations 
21.7 through 21.10.
	
2.	From known LTs of functions, using the proper-
ties of the LT discussed in Section 21.2.
	
3.	Lookup in tables of LT pairs. Extensive tables 
are available of the LTs of many types of func-
tions and their inverse functions.
	
4.	Use of MATLAB’s ‘laplace’ command. For exam-
ple, if we enter
>>syms a t
>>laplace(exp(−a*t))
MATLAB returns: 1/(s+a)

The RHS of Equation 21.31 is indeed the LT of 
the RHS of Equation 21.30.
It should be emphasized that, whereas the LTs of f(t) 
and f(t)u(t) are the same, when f(t) does not have an 
impulse at the origin, the function being differentiated 
in the differentiation-in-time property is f(t) and not 
f(t)u(t). Thus, the derivative of (cosωt)u(t) is (cosωt)δ(t) – 
ω(sinωt)u(t) = δ(t) – ω(sinωt)u(t), which has an impulse 
at the origin, because of the sudden jump of (cosωt)u(t) 
at the origin from 0 at t = 0− to unity at t = 0+. The LT of 
this derivative is 1 – ω2/(s2 + ω2) = s2/(s2 + ω2), whereas 
the LT of the derivative of (cosωt) is −ω2/(s2 + ω2). 
Nevertheless, the differentiation-in-time property also 
applies to (cosωt)u(t). For according to this property,

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Consider next a function f(t)u(t) that is translated in 
time by a positive constant a, to become f(t – a)u(t – a), 
as was explained in connection with Figure 20.25. The

Because of the presence of u(t – a), the integrand is zero 
for t ≤ a− and is f(t – a) for t ≥ a+. Assume to begin with that 
f(t) does not have an impulse at the origin, so that f(t – a) 
does not have an impulse at t = a. The integral of Equation 
21.38 is therefore the same if the lower limit is a− or a+. 
Taking the lower limit as a+ and substituting t′ = t – a:

where the dummy variable of integration was changed 
back from t′ to t, and e−as was taken outside the integra-
tion sign because it is a constant as far as integration with 
respect to t′ is concerned. If f(t) has an impulse Kδ(t) at the 
origin, then it could be expressed as f(t) = Kδ(t) + f ′(t), where 
f ′(t) does not have an impulse at the origin. The shifted 
function becomes f(t – a)u(t – a) = Kδ(t – a) + f ′(t − a)​u(t – a). 
From Equations 21.37 and 21.39, the LT of the RHS of this 
equation is Ke−as + e−asF′(s) = e−as(K + F′(s)) = e−asF(s), where 
F′(s) is the LT of f ′(t). It follows that

As a simple example, consider the rectangular pulse of 
Figure 21.2. The pulse can be expressed as f(t) = Ku(t) −

The translation-in-time property can be used to deter-

The reader may have noted that in Section 21.1 we 
referred to the region of convergence in the s-plane, which 
assured convergence of the integral (Equation 21.3), yet 
no reference to this region of convergence was made in 
subsequent discussions of the LT. In fact, the validity of 
the unilateral LT is not restricted to the region of conver-
gence but extends to the whole of the s-plane except at 
the poles (Section 21.3), where the LT becomes infinite.
Table 21.1 summarizes the basic properties of the LT.
Example 21.3:  Laplace Transform of a Sawtooth Pulse
As an illustrative example of the properties of the LT 
and of graphical manipulation of basic waveforms, 
we will consider the derivation of the LT of the single 
sawtooth pulse of Figure 21.3 by four methods.

ing in the solid line plot in Figure 21.4a; (3) to obtain

Method 3: Consider the rectangular pulse of amplitude 
A/T and duration T (Figure 21.5a). The integral of this 
pulse increases linearly with a slope A/T over the range 
0 ≤ t ≤ T, and equals A at t = T. The integral remains at 
this value for t ≥ T (Figure 21.5b). The LT of the rectan-
gular pulse of Figure 21.5a is given by Equation 21.36 for 
Figure 21.2, with A/T replacing K and T replacing a, to 
give (A/T)(1 − e−Ts)/s. Dividing this by s gives the LT of 
the integral function. When the delayed step −Au(t – T), 
whose LT is −Ae−Ts/s, is added to the integral function, 
the LT of the given pulse is obtained. The sum of the LT 
of the integrated function and that of the delayed step 
gives the same result as in Equation 21.51.
As a variation on this method, the derivative of 
f(t) is the rectangular pulse of Figure 21.5a plus an 
impulse −Aδ(t  –  T). The LT of the combination is 
(A/T)(1 − e−Ts)/s − Ae−Ts. Dividing by s to obtain the LT of 
the integral gives the same result.
Method 4: Consider a rectangular pulse of unit ampli-
tude and unit duration (Figure 21.6a). If a ramp func-
tion x(t) = t is multiplied by this unit rectangular pulse, 
the product is a sawtooth pulse of unit amplitude and 
unit duration (Figure 21.6b). The LT of the unit rectan-
gular pulse is (1 − e−s)/s (Equation 21.41). Multiplication 
by t is equivalent to differentiating this with respect to 
s and changing the sign (Equation 21.44). This gives 
(1 − e−s − se−s)/s2. If the sawtooth pulse is of height 1 
and duration T, then the ramp function becomes t/T, 
so that the value is unity at t = T rather than t =  1.
This is equivalent to time scaling (Equation 21.16) 
with a = 1/T. The LT and s are multiplied by T, which 
gives (1 − e−sT − sTe−sT)/Ts2. Multiplying this by A gives 
Equation 21.51.

The following concept should be noted in connection 
with Equation 21.54 that is an important feature of the 
LT method:
Concept: A linear, ordinary differential equation with con-
stant coefficients is transformed by the LT to an algebraic 
equation in powers of s that can be solved for the LT of the 
variable of the equation Y(s), as in any algebraic equation. 
When this is done, the initial conditions y(0−) and y(1)(0−) 
appear like applied inputs.
Formally, the solution to the differential equation, y(t) 
can be expressed as

where L−1 denotes the ILT.
The first term on the RHS of Equation 21.55 is the 
response y(t) for nonzero initial conditions, with no forc-
ing function. It is the natural response or zero-input 
response. The second term is the response y(t) to the 
forcing function alone. It is the steady-state response, the 
forced response, or zero-state response. Because the sys-
tem is linear, the total response is the sum of the natural 
and forced responses, the initial conditions being treated 
as inputs at t = 0 (Section 22.1). The denominator as2 + bs + c 
is analogous, term by term to the LHS of Equation 21.52 
with the first and second derivatives replaced by s and s2, 
respectively. The equation as2 + bs + c = 0 is the character-
istic ­equation previously derived from the homogenous 
differential equation (Equation 12.6).
Concept: The characteristic equation of a linear differen-
tial equation is a polynomial in s obtained by taking the 
LT of the equation with zero forcing function (the homo-
geneous equation), zero initial conditions, and assuming 
a nonzero value of the variable of the equation. The LHS 
of the characteristic equation appears in the denominator 
of the LT of all the responses derived from the differential 
equation.
Thus, if we take the LT of Equation 21.52, with f(t) = 0 
and zero initial conditions, we obtain (as2 + bs + c)Y(s) = 0. 
In general, Y(s) ≠ 0, so that as2 + bs + c = 0 is the character-

The ILT can be obtained in one of the following ways:
	
1.	Lookup in tables of LT pairs, as previously 
mentioned.
	
2.	Numerical inversion of the LT.
	
3.	The LTs of responses of LTI circuits having 
lumped circuit parameters are rational functions 
of s. These can be expressed, at least in part, as 
proper rational functions. Such functions can be 
expanded as partial fractions, which are then 
inverted term by term.
	
4.	Use of MATLAB’s ‘ilaplace’ command. For 
­example, if we enter:
>> syms s
>> ilaplace (1/s^5)
MATLAB returns: 1/24*t^4
For convenience in determining ILTs, Table 21.2 
­summarizes the LTs of some commonly encountered 
functions in circuit analysis, based on the properties of 
the LT discussed in the previous section.

where K = am/bn. The values −z1, −z2, …, −zm are zeros 
of F(s) since F(s) = 0 when s assumes any of these val-
ues. The values −p1, −p2, …, −pn are poles of F(s), since 
F(s) → ∞ when s assumes any of these values. In gen-
eral zeros and poles may be complex, in which case 
they must occur in complex conjugate pairs, because 
the a’s and b’s are real in the LTs of physical systems. 
Note that Y(s), derived from the differential equation 
of a circuit response (Equation 21.54), is a rational 
function.
In general, m > n in Equation 21.56, so by divid-

where r < n. This makes the ratio of polynomials on the 
RHS a proper rational function. The inverse transform of 
k0 is k0δ(t), that of k1s is k1δ(1)(t), and that of km − nsm − n is 
km − nδ(m − n)(t) (Table 21.2). It remains to determine the ILT 
of the proper rational function, which we will denote 
as  N s
D s
( )
( ) .
Most textbooks discuss methods for deriving the par-
tial fraction expansion (PFE) of proper rational func-
tions. These methods are based on examples in which 
the coefficients of s in N(s) and D(s) are relatively small 
whole numbers, and the power of s in D(s) is usually 
2 or  3. Such examples, however, are rather artificial, 
and the aforementioned methods become impractical 
in more realistic cases where the coefficients of s are 
not small whole numbers and the power of s in the 
denominator exceeds 3. In practice, the ILT is obtained 
in these cases using MATLAB’s ‘ilaplace’ command, 
without deriving the PFE, as illustrated by Example 
21.4. Moreover, this command can be used irrespec-
tive of whether or not the rational function is proper. 
Nevertheless, the PFE is of theoretical importance. We 
will therefore consider in the following paragraphs 
some aspects of the PFE that are important for future 
discussions.

where the K’s are constant coefficients known as the res-

Substituting s = −1, the LHS of Equation 21.62 gives 1, 
and the RHS reduces to K1, so that K1 = 1. Similarly, 
multiplying both sides of Equation 21.61 by (2s + 3) and 
setting s = −3/2 gives K2 = 2, whereas multiplying both 
sides of Equation 21.61 by (s + 2) and ­substituting s = −2 
gives K3 = −1. It follows that the PFE of F(s) is

To see how F(s) can be represented 
by a PFE, we express the numerator in terms of powers 
of (s + 1). To do so, the numerator is written as k1(s + 1)2 + 
k2(s + 1) + k3. This is set equal to 3s2 + 8s + 4, and k1, k2, 
and k3 are determined by comparing coefficients of the 
terms having the same power of s and the constant term. 
It follows that k1 = 3, k2 = 2, and k3 = −1. Hence,

(21.66)
The residue method can only be used to determine Kn 
by multiplying both sides of Equation 21.66 by (s + p)n 
and setting s = −p. Thus, if both sides are multiplied 
by (s + p)n − 1, for example, in order to determine Kn−1, 
the LHS becomes N(s)/(s + p), and the term in Kn on 
the RHS becomes Kn/(s + p). Setting s = −p makes both 
sides infinite. The same is true if both sides are multi-
plied by (s + p) raised to any of the smaller powers in the 
denominator. The residues K1 to Kn–1 can be determined 
analytically either through differentiation or by equat-
ing the coefficients of the same power of s, as well as the 
constant term, on both sides of the equation (Examples 
21.4 and 21.6, respectively). It should be noted that 
whereas the poles in Equation 21.60 are simple poles, 
−p in Equation 21.66 is referred to as a multiple pole of 
order n.
The roots considered so far are real, but the same con-
siderations apply if the roots are complex, except that, 
since the coefficients in N(s) and D(s) are real, complex 
poles must occur in conjugate pairs and their residues 
must also be conjugate pairs. We will illustrate working 
with simple complex poles in Example 21.4, but as men-
tioned earlier, the ILT can be derived using MATLAB’s 
‘ilaplace’ command without  ­determining  the resi-
dues, and irrespective of whether the poles are real or 
­complex, single or multiple.

using MATLAB and by PFE.
Solution:

MATLAB returns: 5 – (5*(cos(2*t) +

where the residues K2 and K2* are complex conjugates 
because their respective poles are complex conjugates. 
This ensures that the coefficients in the numerator of 
F(s) are real quantities, as they should be for any physi-
cal system. K1 is determined in the usual manner by 
multiplying both sides of Equation 21.68 by s and set-
ting s = 0. This gives K1 = 5. K2 is determined in the same 
manner by first multiplying both sides of Equation 21.68 
by (s + 1 + j2). Thus,

Simplifying and expressing the complex exponents in

Note that in the PFE, if the denominator is a term for a 
simple pole, real or complex, the numerator is a constant 
and equal to a residue of the function, as in Equations 21.61 
and 21.68. If the denominator is a term for a multiple pole 
pn, the PFE includes all terms having in the denominator 
(s + p) raised to all integral powers from 1 to n, the numer-
ators of these terms being constants, as in Equation 21.66. 
However, when the two terms involving simple, complex 
conjugate poles are combined, the denominator is qua-
dratic in s, and the numerator is, in general, linear in s, as 
it should be in a proper rational function. The numera-
tor is therefore expressed as k2s + k3 in the second term 
on the RHS in Equation 21.72. k1 is determined as before 
by multiplying both sides of Equation 21.72 by s and set-
ting s = 0, which gives k1 = 5; k2 and k3 are obtained by 
combining the two terms on the RHS of Equation 21.72 
into a single term having a common denominator. The 
coefficients of terms having s raised to the same integral 
power in the numerator on both sides of the equation are 
then compared, as well as the constant term. With k1 = 5, 
Equation 21.72 is expressed as

The next step is to complete the square of the qua-
dratic in the denominator on the RHS. Thus, s2 + 
2s + 5 = [(s  +  1)2  +  22]. The numerator is expressed 
in terms of the squared term in s in the denominator, 
that resulted from completing the square. This term is 
(s + 1). Thus, 5s + 10 = 5(s + 1) + 5. F(s) becomes

Problem-Solving Tip
•	 Working with complex quantities can be 
avoided by combining complex conjugate poles 
in the PFE into a single term. The numerator of 
this term is linear in s when its denominator is 
quadratic in s and the complex poles are simple.

Note that −ar cannot be a purely imaginary pole, like 
that of the LT of cosωt and sinωt because such poles are 
on the imaginary axis, with no negative real part. They 
are excluded in the statement of the final-value theorem. 
Multiplying both sides of Equation 21.77 by s and set-
ting s = 0 gives F(s) = K1. It follows from this equation

The impulse function and its derivatives are over at 
t = 0+. When −ar is real, the ILT of the term Kr/(s + ar)m 
is, from Table 21.2, of the form e a t
r
-
 multiplied by an 
integral power of t. When −ar is complex, equal to −σr ± 
jωr, where σr and ωr are positive numbers, the ILT is of 
the form e a t

-
 multiplied, in general, by terms contain-
ing cosωrt and sinωrt, which in turn may be multiplied 
by t raised to some power. In all these cases the expo-
nential multiplier e a t

-
 approaches zero as t → ∞, so that 
these terms vanish. It follows that f(t) → K1 as t → ∞. 
Note that a multiple pole at the origin makes  sF(s) → 
∞ for s = 0 and is not in accordance with the statement 
of the final-value theorem. In this case f(t) → ∞ as t → ∞ 
(Primal Exercise 21.9). However, the equal limits at infin-
ity cannot be considered as satisfying Equation  21.76.

If F(s) is not a proper rational function, f(t) has 
impulses or their derivatives at the origin. But these are 
over at t = 0+. The correct value of f(0+) is obtained by 
applying the initial-value theorem to the proper rational 
fraction part of F(s).
The initial- and final-value theorems are useful for 
checking the LT for a given variable, because it is often 
obvious from the nature of the problem what the initial and 
final values of the variable are. Moreover, the initial-value 
theorem is particularly useful in the case of impulsive 
readjustments at t = 0 when the voltage across a capaci-
tor, or the current through an inductor, is forced to change 
instantaneously. The initial-value theorem gives the cor-
rect values at t = 0+ after the impulsive readjustments are 
over, as will be demonstrated in the next chapter.

. The conditions 
for applying the final-value theorem are satisfied. 
Multiplying by s and setting s = 0 gives sF(s) = 0, 
so that f(∞) = 0. The conditions for ­applying the 
initial-value theorem are also satisfied. Multiply­
ing by s and letting s → ∞ gives sF(s) = 3, so that 
f(0+) = 3.

Multiplying both sides by (s + 3) and setting 
s  =  −3 gives k1 = 1. Multiplying both sides by 
(s + 4) and setting s = −4 gives k2 = 2. It follows 
that f(t) = e−3t + 2e−4t. It is seen that f(0+) = 3 and 
f(∞) = 0.
	 (b)	 Multiplying by s and setting s = 0 gives sF(s) = 0, 
so that f(∞) = 0. This, however, is not correct, 
because the conditions for applying the final-
value theorem are not satisfied since there are 
two complex poles on the imaginary axis at ±j2, 
without having negative real parts. The condi-
tions for the initial-value theorem are satisfied. 
Multiplying by s and letting s → ∞ gives sF(s) = 2, 
so that f(0+) = 2.

	 (c)	 The conditions for applying the final-value theo-
rem are satisfied: (i) the pole at the origin is sim-
ple, and (ii) the complex poles are at −2 ± j have 
negative real parts. Multiplying by s and setting 
s = 0 gives sF(s) = 24, so that f(∞) = 24. To apply 
the ­initial-value theorem, we note that the func-
tion is not a proper rational function. If multi-
plied by s and s  → ∞, F(s) → ∞. To obtain the 
value at t = 0+, the numerator is divided by the 
denominator to give a proper rational function.

The inner integral is f(t) * g(t), and the outer integral is 
its LT, which proves the convolution theorem.
The convolution theorem allows the derivation of the 
convolution integral of two functions of time, other than 
by direct evaluation or using the graphical method, as 
illustrated by Example 21.6.
The convolution theorem can be used to prove the 
invariance of convolution with inverse integration and 
differentiation (Equation 20.23) for functions that are 
zero for t < 0–. Thus, if F(s) is the LT of f(t) that is zero for 
t < 0–, then the LT of f (n)(t), the nth derivative of f(t), is 
snF(s) (Equation 21.23). The LT of f (−n)(t), the nth integral 
of f(t), is F(s)/sn (Equation 21.17). Similarly for a function 
g(t) that is zero for t < 0. But,

combining the terms on the RHS in a single term hav-

of the numerator on both sides of the equation, as was

Properties of the Laplace Transform

Since v1(t) is experimentally derived, it can be repre-
sented by a staircase function (Section 20.4). cost can also 
be represented as a staircase function, so that cost * v1(t) 
can be obtained as the product of two polynomials.

of f(t) for t < 0− are ignored.
•	 For a function f(t) that does not have an 
impulse at the origin, the lower limit in 
the one-sided LT could be 0− or 0+ or 0:

. In this case, 
the LT of f(t) is the same as the LT of f(t)u(t), irre-
spective of the lower limit of integration being 
0− or 0+ or 0.
•	 The LT transform has many properties that can 
be used for the derivation of the LTs of other 
functions. These properties include multiplica-
tion by a constant, addition/subtraction, time 
scaling, integration, differentiation, translation 
in the s-domain, translation in time, multiplica-
tion by t, and division by t. These properties are 
listed in Table 21.1.
•	 A linear differential equation is transformed by 
the LT to an algebraic equation in powers of s 
that can be solved for the LT of the variable of 
the equation Y(s), as in any algebraic equation. 
When this is done, the initial conditions y(0−) 
and y(1)(0−) appear like applied inputs.
•	 The characteristic equation of a linear differen-
tial equation is a polynomial in s obtained by 
taking the LT of the equation with zero forcing 
function (the homogeneous equation), zero ini-
tial conditions, and assuming a nonzero value of 
the variable of the equation. The LHS of the char-
acteristic equation appears in all the responses 
derived from the differential equation.
•	 The LTs of responses of LTI circuits having 
lumped circuit parameters are rational functions 
of s. These can be expressed, at least in part, as 
proper rational functions. Such functions can be 
expanded as partial fractions, which are then 
inverted term by term.
•	 The zeros of F(s) are the roots of the numera-
tor of F(s) so that F(s) = 0, when s equals any 
of these roots. The poles of F(s) are the roots of 
the denominator of F(s) so that F(s) → ∞ when s 
equals any of these roots.
•	 When the poles are simple and real, the PFE is 
of the form

, where Kr is the
 
residue of pole pr, r = 1, 2, …, n. Kr can be readily 
determined by the residue method, that is, by 
multiplying both sides of the equation by (s + pr) 
and setting s = −pr.
•	 When the poles are complex, they occur in com-
plex conjugate pairs, and their residues are also 
complex conjugates so as to have real coefficients 
of the polynomials in the numerator and denom-
inator of F(s). Working with complex quantities 
is avoided by the following procedure:
	
1.	 The two terms involving complex conjugate 
poles are combined, resulting in a term that 
is quadratic in s in the denominator, and, in 
general, linear in s in the numerator.
	
2.	 The coefficients of the linear function in the 
numerator are determined by comparing coef-
ficients of terms having s raised to the same 
integral power, as well as the constant term, 
on both sides of the equation for the PFE.
	
3.	 The square is completed in the quadratic 
of the denominator, and the numerator is 
expressed in terms of the squared term in s in 
the denominator, after completing the square.
	
4.	 The resulting expression in s is inverted in terms 
of cosine and sine functions of time, multi-
plied by an exponential function of time.
•	 The PFE of a multiple pole or order n is of the form

Only Kn can be determined by the resi-

either by successive differentiation or by multi-
plying out to have a common denominator and 
comparing coefficients of various powers of s, 
as well as the constant term, on both sides of the 
equation for the PFE.

. The final-value theorem 
­cannot be applied if F(s) has a multiple pole at 
the origin or has poles on the imaginary axis.

nal function, then lim

. If F(s) is 
not  a proper rational function, the numerator 
is divided by the denominator, and the initial-
value theorem is applied to the rational fraction 
part to obtain f(0+). In case of impulsive read-
justment in a circuit at t = 0, the initial-value the-
orem gives the responses just after the impulse 
is over at t = 0+.
•	 The convolution theorem provides the link 
between the convolution integral and the LT. It 
states that F(s)G(s) = L{f(t) * g(t)}. The convolu-
tion theorem allows an alternative derivation 
of the convolution integral of two functions 
of time.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	In applying the differentiation-in-time property, 
the function that is differentiated is f(t), and not 
f(t)u(t). It follows that f(0−) in Equation 21.22 is 
the value of f(t) at t = 0− and not the value of 
f(t)u(t) at t = 0−, which is zero.
	
2.	Working with complex quantities can be 
avoided by combining complex conjugate poles 
in the PFE into a single term. The numerator of 
this term is, in general, linear in s when the com-
plex poles are simple.
	
3.	The initial- and final-value theorems can 
provide a useful check on the LT of a given 
response, using the limiting values of this 
response.
	
4.	In inverting the LT, MATLAB’s ‘ilaplace’ com-
mand can be used irrespective of whether F(s) is 
a proper rational function or not, and irrespec-
tive of whether the poles are real or complex, 
single or multiple.

. Clearly, if s is in
 
rad/s, then s′ is in krad/s. This is because if s′ is in 
krad/s, its numerical value is 10−3 times that of s 
in rad/s. Hence s′ should be multiplied by 103 to have 
the same numerical value as s.
However, replacing s by 103s′ does not change the 
units of F′(s′), which remain s, the same as F(s). But when 
inverting F′(s′) the unit of time should be in ms, since s′ 
is in krad/s. This means that when inverting F′(s′), the 
ILT should be multiplied by 103 to convert it from s to 
ms. Thus, the ILT of F′(s′) is f(t) = 103(2e−3t′ − e−2t′), with t′ 
in ms. This can be readily verified. Thus,

The ILT is f(t) = 103(2e−3 × 103t − e−2 × 103t), which is the same 
result, with t in s.
A more formal argument for multiplying the ILT by 103

t , where f ′(t′) is the inverse transform of F′(s′) 
and t′ is in ms. Hence, f(t) = 2 × 103e−3t′ − 103e−2t′.
Note that in applying the initial- and final-value 
theorems, when F′(s′) is multiplied by s′ and the limit 
obtained as s′ tends to infinity or zero, the result must 
also be multiplied by 103 in order to obtain the correct 
limiting value of f(t).
Similar considerations apply if s is  replaced by 106s′, 
where s′ is in Mrad/s. The ILT should then be multi-
plied by 106.

Objective and Overview
After having considered the basic properties of the 
Laplace transform (LT) in Chapter 21, the application 
of the LT to circuit analysis is presented in this ­chapter. 
The discussion naturally begins with the representa-
tion of circuit elements in the s-domain. Because the 
LT of a given function excludes values of the function 
for t < 0−, special consideration must be given to initial 
conditions in energy storage elements. This is followed 
by a discussion of the general ­procedure for analyzing 
circuits in the s-domain, including ­switching circuits, 
since the LT transform offers some unique advantages 
in these cases. The LT transform of circuit responses 
naturally leads to the concept of transfer function, 
which allows some important conclusions in terms 
of impulse response, stability, and sinusoidal steady-
state response. The chapter ends with interpretations 
of poles and zeros in the s-domain and the responses 
of first-order and ­second-order circuits.
22.1  Representation of Circuit 
Elements in the s-Domain
In order to fully utilize the power of the LT approach, 
the circuit should be analyzed entirely in the s-domain. 
It is necessary for this purpose to be able to represent 
circuit elements in the s-domain, including any initial 
conditions of energy storage elements. Once this is 
done, the conventional circuit analysis techniques that 
were applied to circuits in the frequency domain can 
be carried over to the s-domain, with currents and volt-
ages represented by their LTs. We will discuss in this 
section how resistors, capacitors, inductors, and linear 
­transformers are represented in the s-domain.
22.1.1  Resistor
Taking the LT of both sides of Ohm’s law v = Ri,

(22.1)
It is seen that in the s-domain, where the resistor 
­voltage and current are V(s) and I(s), respectively, the 
resistor is simply represented by its resistance R.

where i is in the direction of a voltage drop v across the 
capacitor (Figure 22.1a). It is assumed that i(t) does not 
include an impulse at t = 0. Hence, i remains finite dur-
ing the interval from t = 0− to t = 0+, so that the lower 
limit of integration could just as well be 0+ instead of 0–.

is replaced by s for an initially uncharged capacitor. 
1/sC can therefore be considered as the impedance of an 
uncharged capacitor in the s-domain.
Suppose that the voltage across the capacitor is chang-
ing arbitrarily with time (Figure 22.1b). Equation 22.2

Comparing Equation 22.5 with Equation 22.3, it is 
seen that VC(s) = I(s)/sC is the LT of the voltage across 
an uncharged capacitor. V0/s is the LT of V0u(t). The 
interpretation of Equation 22.5 is that because the 
single-sided LT excludes values of v for t  <  0−, and 
since VC(s) = I(s)/sC is the LT of the voltage across an 
uncharged capacitor, then in order to account for the ini-
tial voltage across the capacitor, it is necessary to add a 
voltage step V0u(t), whose LT is V0/s. In other words, v 
is divided into two components (Figure 22.1c): (1) a volt-
age vC across an initially uncharged capacitor and (2) a 
step function V0u(t). In circuit terms, these two compo-
nents are represented as in Figure 22.1d. The step volt-
age establishes the initial voltage V0 at t = 0+ between 
terminals ‘ab’. Thereafter, for t ≥ 0+, the voltage vC across 
the initially uncharged capacitor changes in accordance 
with i, added to the initial voltage V0. Taking the LT of 
the sum v = (vC + V0u(t)) gives Equation 22.5. The circuit 
in the s-domain is shown in Figure 22.2a.
The ideal voltage source V0/s in series with the 
uncharged capacitor of impedance 1/sC (Figure 22.2a) 
can be transformed to a current source (V0/s)/(1/sC) = 
CV0 in parallel with the same uncharged capacitor, as 
in Figure 22.2b, where CV0 is the LT of an impulse of 
strength CV0. Alternatively, this representation of the 
initial capacitor voltage can be derived from the LT of 
the alternative form of the v–i relation of the capacitor 
i = Cdv/dt. This gives

(22.6)
Figure 22.2b is the representation of the circuit of 
Figure 22.2c in the s-domain. In this figure, C is initially 
uncharged. The capacitor provides a short-circuit path 
for the impulse CV0δ(t), which deposits a charge CV0 
on the uncharged capacitor, resulting in the initial volt-
age V0 at t = 0+. Thereafter, for t ≥ 0+, the current source 
behaves as an open circuit, so that i flows through C and 
v changes accordingly.
It was assumed in the preceding that i does not include 
an impulse at t = 0. If i did include such an impulse, then 
by superposition, the impulse simply deposits addi-
tional charge on the capacitor between t = 0− and t = 0+.
Note that whereas in the time domain, the rela-
tion i = Cdv/dt is incomplete in the sense that it does 
not explicitly involve V0, as noted in connection with 
Equation 7.6, its transformation to the s-domain does 
involve V0 in accordance with the differentiation-in-time 
property of the LT.
How does one obtain Q(s), the LT of the charge 
on the capacitor in the s-domain in the circuits of 
Figure 22.2a and  b? In both cases, Q(s)  =  CV(s), as 
­follows from taking the LT of both sides of the equa-
tion q(t)  =  Cv(t). However, in Figure 22.2a, the charge 
on the ideal capacitor alone is the charge accumu-
lated only for t > 0+, to which must be added the initial 
charge at t = 0+. Thus, v(t) = vC(t) + V0 (Equation 22.4), 
so that q t
C v
t
V
C
( ) =

(
)
0 , t ≥ 0+. Taking the LT of both 
sides gives Q(s) as Q(s) = C(VC(s) + V0/s) = CV(s). Hence, 
in determining Q(s) from Figure 22.2a, the voltage step 
V0u(t) must be included as part of the voltage across the 
capacitor.
On the other hand, the impulse in Figure 21.1b depos-
its the initial charge CV0 and is over at t = 0+. The charge 
on the ideal capacitor at any time t ≥ 0+ is therefore the 
true charge. This is reflected in having VC(s) the same 
V(s) in Figure 22.2b.

Comparing with the frequency-domain representa-

of an uncharged inductor in the s-domain.
If the inductor has an initial current I0 at t  =  0−,

(22.10)
Comparing Equation 22.10 with Equation 22.8, it is 
seen that V(s)/sL is the LT of the current through an 
uncharged inductor. I0/s is the LT of I0u(t). The interpre-
tation of Equation 22.10 is similar to that of the case of the 
capacitor. Since V(s)/sL is the LT of the current through 
an uncharged inductor, the initial current I0 is established 
between terminals ‘ab’ at t = 0+ by a current step I0u(t) in 
parallel with an ideal uncharged inductor. For t ≥ 0+, v 
between terminals ‘ab’ varies according to the current iL 
through the uncharged inductor, added to the initial cur-
rent I0 (Figure 22.3b). The LT of I0u(t) is I0/s, so that the 
circuit of Figure 22.3b is represented in the s-domain as 
in Figure 22.4a, in accordance with Equation 22.10.
The ideal current source I0/s in parallel with the imped-
ance sL in Figure 22.4a can be transformed to an equiv-
alent voltage source (I0/s)  ×  sL  =  LI0 in series with the 
impedance sL. The ideal voltage source in Figure 22.4b is 
an impulse LI0δ(t) in the time domain that is a voltage rise 
in the direction of current through the inductor (Figure 
22.4c). The impulse, acting through the circuit connected 
to the inductor, establishes an initial current I0 in the induc-
tor between t = 0− and t = 0+, with the inductor acting as 
on open circuit. Thereafter, for t ≥ 0+, the voltage source 
behaves as a short circuit, and i changes with the current 
through the inductor, added to the initial current I0.
The representation of R, L, and C in the s-domain can 
be summarized as follows:
Summary: In the s-domain, the impedance of a resistor is R, 
that  of an uncharged capacitor is 1/sC, and that of an 
uncharged inductor is sL. To account for initial energy 
­storage, while considering the values of all responses to be zero 
at t = 0−, in accordance with the LT, step or impulse, ideal, 
independent sources are added in series or in parallel with 
the ideal energy storage element so as to provide the required 
­initial value at t = 0+.
The fact that sources are added to account for initial 
conditions at the terminals of the energy storage ele-
ment in the s-domain implies the following concept:
Concept: The sources that are added to account for initial 
conditions in the energy storage elements in the s-domain 
become an integral part of the representation of the energy 
storage element in the s-domain.
This is indicated in Figures 22.2 and 22.4, where 
the LT V(s) of the terminal voltage across the energy 
storage element includes the voltage of the series-
connected voltage source (Figures 22.2a and 22.4b). 
The LT I(s) of the terminal current through the energy 
storage element includes the current of the parallel-
connected current source (Figures 22.2b and 22.4a).

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
An important implication is that these independent 
sources can be treated just like any sources of excita-
tion, so that they can be included in superposition, 
for example. This is in accordance with the funda-
mental concept that in an LTI circuit the responses 
to initial conditions can be added, by superposition, 
to the responses due to applied inputs acting alone. 
This fundamental concept is further exemplified by 
Equation 21.55, which indicates that initial conditions 
can be treated as inputs at t = 0.
Example 22.1:  RL Circuit with Initial 
Current in Inductor
A voltage VSRCu(t) is applied at t = 0 to a series RL cir-
cuit in which the inductor has an initial current I0 
(Figure  22.5a). It is desired to derive the expressions 
for the current in the circuit and the voltage across the

The s-domain representation of the circuit is shown in

Any s-domain representation of the coupled coils must 
satisfy Equations 22.19. It can be readily verified that the 
T-circuit of Figure 22.7b satisfies these equations and is in 
accordance with the voltage source representation of the 
initial current through an inductor (Figure 22.4b). Thus, 
the s-domain impedances are the inductances of the 
T-equivalent circuit of Figure 9.26b multiplied by s. The 
initial current on the input side is I10 and is associated with 
an inductance (L1 − M), so that the source voltage account-
ing for the initial conditions in this inductor is a voltage 
rise (L1 − M)I10 in the direction of current. Similarly on 
the output side. The initial current in the shunt branch is 
(I10 − I20) downward and the source voltage is a voltage 
rise M(I10 − I20) in the direction of the current.
Primal Exercise 22.3
Represent the initial current in each of the three ­inductors 
in the circuit of Figure 22.7b by a parallel current source, 
as in Figure 22.4a. Assume that the dot markings on one 
coil are reversed from those of Figure 22.7a.
22.2  Solution of Circuit Problems 
in the s-Domain
It was emphasized earlier that in circuit analysis, the 
fundamental relations that must be satisfied are KCL, 
KVL, and the v–i relations of the circuit elements. When 
KCL is satisfied by instantaneous currents at a given 
node, then by taking LTs, KCL will also be satisfied in 
the s-domain. Similarly for voltage rises and drops that 
satisfy KVL. In the preceding section, we have seen how 
the v–i relations of circuit elements are represented in 
the s-domain, including initial values. The ­following 
concept applies:
Concept: All circuit laws and techniques discussed previ-
ously for the frequency domain using phasor notation, apply 
equally well to the s-domain. These include series and parallel 
combinations of s-domain impedances and ­admittances; Y-Δ 
transformation; node-­voltage, mesh-current, and loop-current 
methods of analysis; TEC and NEC; and superposition.
We have already applied in problems of the preceding 
sections, KVL, superposition, and source transforma-
tion in the s-domain.
The first step in the general procedure for analyzing 
circuits using the LT method is to transform the circuit 
to the s-domain, representing passive circuit elements 
by their s-domain impedances, initial values of volt-
ages across capacitors and currents though inductors by 
appropriate sources, and independent and dependent

voltage or current sources by their LTs. The circuit is 
then analyzed by any of the techniques described pre-
viously for phasor analysis, and the LT of the desired 
circuit response is derived. The essential feature of the 
LT method is that the circuit equations are now alge-
braic in s, just as they were algebraic in jω in the case 
of phasor analysis. However, the ILT gives the complete 
response in the time domain, both transient and steady 
state, to any arbitrary excitation that has an LT.

a Unit Voltage Impulse
It is required to determine I s

These results can be interpreted on the basis that when 
the voltage impulse is applied, the uncharged induc-
tor initially behaves as an open circuit, as discussed in 
Section 18.5. The impulse appears across the inductor, 
and the inductor current jumps to 1/L  =  1  A, so that 
i1(0+)  =  1  A. Since the voltage across the uncharged 
capacitor is not being forced to change by any current 
impulse, it remains zero. This means that the voltage 
across the resistor is the same as that across the depen-
dent source, that is, i

If r = 1, the voltage across the resistor is the same 
as that across the dependent source, so i2 = 0 for all t.

22.2.1  Switching
As mentioned in connection with the initial-value 
theorem (Section 21.4), the LT method is particularly 
useful for solving switching problems in which impul-
sive readjustment takes place at the time of switching 
because capacitor voltages or inductor currents are 
forced to change at this instant. The general procedure 
is to represent the circuit in the s-domain, as usual, after 
switching occurs, that is, t ≥ 0+, but including the initial 
conditions for voltages across capacitors, and currents 
through inductors, just before switching takes place 
(t  =  0−). The initial-value theorem gives any desired 
circuit response at t = 0+. When no impulsive readjust-
ments are involved at t  =  0, the initial conditions for 
voltages across capacitors and currents through induc-
tors are of course the same at t = 0− as at t = 0+.

Example 22.3:  Switched Responses 
of Capacitors in Parallel with a Resistor
In the circuit of Figure 22.9a, C1 has an initial voltage 
V10 = 50 V, and C2 is uncharged. If the switch is closed at 
t = 0, determine the voltage across the parallel combina-
tion and the currents in the circuit as functions of time. 
This example is the same as Example 19.9, but with dif-
ferent numerical values.
Solution:
The circuit for t ≥ 0+, after the switch is closed, is shown 
in Figure 22.9b, indicating v and the currents in the 
three branches. This circuit is shown in the s-domain 
in Figure 22.10, but with the initial conditions for t = 0−, 
before the switch is closed. The initial condition in the 
0.3 F capacitor is represented by the parallel, current-
impulse source, since the circuit is a parallel circuit. The 
source is CV0 = 0.3 × 50 = 15 As or C. V(s) is I1(s) multi-
plied by 1/0.2s Ω in parallel with 2 Ω:

(22.32)
Physically, the initial charge on C1 is 15 C. When the 
switch is closed, this charge is distributed between C1 and 
C2 so as to equalize the voltage across them. The parallel 
capacitance is 0.5 F and the common voltage at t = 0+ is 
v(0+) = 15/0.5 = 30 V, as in Equation 22.29. Charge is con-
served at t = 0+, bearing on mind that no charge is trans-
ferred by iR at this instant, as was explained in Example 19.9. 
The charge on C1 at t = 0+ is 0.3 × 30 = 9 C, and the charge 
on C2 at t = 0+ is 0.2 × 30 = 6 C. Hence, 6 C are transferred 
between t = 0− and t = 0+ by a current impulse 6δ(t) A, as 
indicated in the expressions for i1(t) and i2(t) in Equations 
22.30 and 22.31. v(t) decays exponentially from its initial 
value of 30 V at t = 0+ with a time constant 2 × 0.5 = 1 s, 
as indicated in Equation 22.29. It follows that iR = i1 + i2, 
for t ≥ 0+, in accordance with Equations 22.30 and 22.31. 
Clearly, iR = v/2, as expected.
Let us examine next what information can be derived 
from the initial- and final-value theorems of the LT. 
Multiplying the LTs of the voltage and currents by s and 
setting s = 0 makes all the final values zero, as expected. 
Multiplying V(s) and IR(s) by s and letting s → ∞ gives 
v(0+) = 30 V and iR(0+) = 15 A, also as expected. To apply 
the initial-value theorem to I1(s) and I2(s), the numerator is 
divided by the denominator to obtain the LT of an impulse 
and a proper rational function. Because the impulse is over 
at t = 0+, it does not contribute to i1(0+) and i2(0+), so that 
these values are determined by the proper rational func-
tion part of the LT. Multiplying these by s and letting s → ∞ 
gives the correct values of i1(0+) = 9 A and i2(0+) = 6 A. This 
is an interesting feature of the LT in that when using the 
initial values at t = 0− in a circuit that applies for t ≥ 0+ and 
that involves impulsive readjustment between t = 0− and 
t = 0+, the initial-value theorem gives correct values at t = 0+ 
for the circuit variables having an impulse.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
The following observations are of interest:
	
1.	i1(t) and i2(t) are given by Equations 22.30 and 22.31 
for all t. Considering i1(t), it is seen that i1(t) = 0 for 
t ≤ 0−. Between t = 0− and t = 0+, i1(t) = 6δ(t) A, since 
the term 9e−tu(t) is finite during this interval and does 
not affect the impulse. For t ≥ 0+, the impulse is over 
and i1(t) = 9e−tu(t) A. i2(t) is similarly interpreted.
	
2.	I1(s), the LT of the current through C1, is from Figure 
22.10, given by I1(s) = 15 – 0.3sV(s) = (6s + 15)/(s + 1), 
as in Equation 22.30. The 15 As current source, being 
part of the representation of the initial conditions of 
C1, must be included as part of the capacitor in the 
s-domain when evaluating the capacitor current.
	
3.	Can i1 and i2 be determined from the v–i relation 
i = Cdv/dt of the capacitors? To do so, one must have 
an expression for capacitor voltage that applies to 
either capacitor for all t. Since the capacitors have 
different initial conditions, they would have dif-
ferent voltage expressions. v in Figure 22.9b is the 
voltage across all the paralleled elements for t ≥ 0+. 
In Equation 22.29, the expression for v is multi-
plied by u(t), which means that v = 0 at t ≤ 0− and 
v = 30 V at t = 0+. This expression for v is therefore 
appropriate for v2, the voltage across C2, which has 
these initial conditions. Differentiating both sides 
of Equation 22.29, considering the RHS as the prod-
uct of two variables, gives −C2dv/dt = −0.2(30e−tδ(t) 
− 30e−tu(t)) = −6δ(t) + 6e−tu(t), as in Equation 22.31.
As for v1, the voltage across C1, this voltage is 
50 V for t ≤ 0−, and v1(t) = 30e−tu(t) V for t ≥ 0+. 
These two conditions can be combined as

Differentiating Equation 22.33 with respect to 
t and multiplying by −C1 gives i1(t) in Equation 
22.30. Note that V1(s) from Equation 22.33 is the 
same as V(s) in Equation 22.29, because the single-
sided LT is the same if the lower limit of integra-
tion is t = 0− or t = 0+ when the function does not 
have an impulse at the origin. Although i1(t) has an 
impulse at the origin, v1(t) has a step at the origin.
	
4.	Q2(s) = C2V(s) = 6/(s + 1) is the LT of the charge on 
C2; q2(t) = 6e−tu(t) C, with q2(0+) = 6 C, as follows 
also from the initial-value theorem. q1(t) = C1v1(t), 
where v1(t) is given by Equation 22.33. Q1(s)  = 
C1V1(s) = C1V(s) = 9/(s + 1), with q1(0+) = 9 C, as 
follows also from the initial-value theorem.
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 In switching problems that involve impulsive 
readjustments at the instant of switching, the ini-
tial values in energy storage elements just before 
switching should be used in the s-domain repre-
sentation of the circuit after switching.
Primal Exercise 22.5
Given C1  =  C2  =  1  F, R  =  0.5 Ω, and V0  =  10  V in 
Example 22.3, determine i1(t), v(t), i2(t), q1(t), and q2(t).
Ans. i1(t) = 5δ(t) + 5e−tu(t) A; v(t) = 5e−tu(t) V; i2(t) = −5δ(t) 
− 5e−tu(t) A, q1(t) = q2(t) = 5e−tu(t) C.
Example 22.4:  Switched Response of an RC Circuit
In Figure 22.11, the switch is moved to position ‘b’ at t = 0 
after being in position ‘a’ for a long time. The switch is 
moved to position ‘a’ at t = 1 s and back to position ‘b’ at 
t = 2 s. Determine vO(t) during the time intervals 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s, 
1 ≤ t ≤ 2 s, and t ≥ 2 s, given that vSRC(t) = 15sintu(t) V.
Solution:
At t  =  0−, vO(0−)  =  5  V, from voltage division, with the 
capacitor  fully charged. During the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 s,

time is the instant when this source is applied at t = 1 s.

22.3  Transfer Function
Definition: When a single excitation is applied to a given 
circuit having no initial energy storage, the transfer function 
H(s) is the ratio of the LT Y(s) of a designated response to the 
LT X(s) of the applied excitation:
	
H s
Y s
X s
( )
( )
( )
=
	
(22.42)
In Example 22.2, I1(s)/Vsrc(s), I2(s)/Vsrc(s), and 
I1(s)/Vsrc(s) are all examples of transfer functions in the 
same circuit. Being the ratio of a response to an excita-
tion, the transfer function is independent of the nature 
of the excitation. It depends on the circuit, on where in 
the circuit the excitation is applied, and on which volt-
age or current in the circuit is the designated response.
A special case of interest is when the applied excitation 
x(t) is δ(t), a unit impulse at the origin. X(s) = 1, so that 
Y(s) = H(s) in the s-domain. By definition y(t) = h(t), the 
response to the unit impulse. It follows that the transfer 
function H(s) and the impulse response h(t) are related 
through a Laplace transformation and its inverse. Thus,

Concept: The LT of the response to a unit impulse of 
­excitation is the transfer function, and the ILT of the transfer 
function is the response in the time domain to a unit impulse 
of excitation.
This concept can be used to relate circuit responses 
in the s- and time domains. Let the only excitation 
applied to a circuit without initial energy storage be v1(t) 
(Figure 22.13a). According to the definition of convolu-
tion (Section 20.1),

That is, as noted earlier, when circuits are cascaded, the 
overall transfer function is the product of the individual 
transfer functions of the two circuits. This does not apply 
in the time domain, where the outputs of the individual 
circuits are related to their inputs by convolution:

This illustrates a great convenience of working with 
transfer functions.
Another important property of the transfer function is 
its relation to the characteristic equation:
Concept: The poles of the transfer function are the roots of the 
characteristic equation.
Recall from Section 12.1 that all the responses in a 
circuit obey the same homogeneous differential equa-
tion, so that the same characteristic equation applies to 
all the variables in a given circuit. It was pointed out 
in Section 21.3, that the characteristic equation is the 
LT of the homogeneous equation, assuming zero ini-
tial conditions, as in the definition of the transfer func-
tion. The LHS of the characteristic equation appears in 
the denominator of all the responses in a given circuit, 
as in Equation 21.55, and as was demonstrated in the 
LT of circuit responses derived in this chapter. In other 
words, the LHS of the characteristic equation appears 
as the denominator of the transfer function for a given 
response in a circuit. It follows that the roots of the char-
acteristic equation are the poles of the transfer function.
22.3.1  Stability
Definition: A circuit is stable if the response to a unit 
impulse tends to zero as t → ∞. The circuit is unstable if the 
response to a unit impulse increases without limit, that is, 
is unbounded as t → ∞. The circuit is marginally stable, or 
metastable, if as t → ∞, the response to a unit impulse does 
not approach zero but remains bounded.
Recall that the response in the time domain to a unit 
impulse is the ILT, h(t), of the transfer function H(s) 
(Equation 22.43), whose poles are the roots of the charac-
teristic equation. Circuit stability is therefore determined 
by the location of the poles of the transfer function in the 
s-plane. Specifically, a distinction is made between (1) poles 
located on the imaginary axis, (2) poles located in the open 
left half of the s-plane, that is, the left half of the s-plane, 
excluding the imaginary axis, and (3) poles located in the 
open right half of the s-plane, excluding the imaginary axis.
Concept: If all the poles of the transfer function lie in the open 
left half of the s-plane, the circuit is stable. If at least one pole 
lies in the open right half of the s-plane, the circuit is unstable. 
If all the poles of the transfer function are simple poles on the 
imaginary axis, the circuit is metastable. If at least one pole on 
the imaginary axis is a multiple pole, the circuit is unstable.
This statement can be justified by considering the ILTs 
of terms in the PFE of H(s). Consider terms of the form 
K/(s + pr) or K/(s + pr)n, which denote, respectively, a 
simple or a multiple pole −pr. If located in the open left 
half of the s-plane, the simple pole is generally of the 
form −pr = −αr − jωr, with −αr < 0. Complex poles must 
occur in complex conjugate pairs in order to have real 
coefficients of H(s). The ILT of a real pole is Ke

!, if the pole 
is of order n (Table 21.2). If the pole is complex, these 
ILTs are multiplied by a cosine term of frequency ωr and 
a phase angle that depends on the residues of the poles. 
In all these cases, these terms vanish as t → ∞ because of 
the presence of the e
rt
-a  term, so that the circuit is stable. 
On the other hand, if the pole lies in the open right half of 
the s-plane, −αr > 0, and e
rt
-

a
 as t → ∞. The impulse 
response is unbounded and the circuit is unstable.
As for poles on the imaginary axis, a simple pole at the 
origin results in a term K/s in the transfer function, whose 
ILT is Ku(t). In the absence of a pole in the open right half 
of the s-plane, the impulse response Ku(t) is bounded, 
and the circuit is metastable. Similarly, a pair of simple 
complex poles on the imaginary axis at ±jωr result in a 
term K s

w
 in the transfer ­function, whose 
ILT is Kcos(ωrt + θ) where θ depends on K1 and K2. The 
impulse response remains bounded as t → ∞, and the 
circuit is metastable. On the other hand, if the poles on 
the imaginary axis are multiple poles, the ILTs will con-
tain t or powers of t (Table 21.2). The impulse response is 
unbounded as t → ∞, and the circuit is unstable.
A constant term, a term in s, or terms in powers of s 
in the transfer function have ILTs that are, respectively, 
an impulse, its first derivative, and its higher deriva-
tives. The ILTs of all these terms are zero at t = 0+. In the 
absence of a pole in the open right half of the s-plane or 
of a multiple pole on the imaginary axis, the impulse 
response is zero as t → ∞, and the circuit is stable.
The following should be noted concerning the loca-
tion of poles in the s-plane:
	
1.	Poles on the imaginary axis have αr = 0. When these 
are the only poles present in the transfer function, 
the circuit is lossless and consists of ideal induc-
tors and capacitors only. Poles in the left half of 

Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis	
667
the s-plane arise because of the presence of resis-
tances in the circuit, which make αr > 0. The cir-
cuit is dissipative. By analogy, poles in the right 
half of the s-plane can be considered to be due to a 
negative resistance, which supplies energy to the 
circuit and causes an unbounded response.
	
2.	A circuit with a simple pole at the origin is 
metastable, as explained previously. However, 
if the circuit is excited at the frequency of the 
pole, the response is unbounded. Consider, for 
example, a capacitor C. Its transfer function in 
terms of V(s)/I(s) is the impedance 1/sC, which 
denotes a simple pole at the origin. A dc source 
is of zero frequency, so that the frequency of the 
source is also at the origin in the s-plane. If C is 
excited by a dc current source Idc, whose LT is 
Idc/s, then V(s) = Idc/s2C; v(t) = (Idc/C)tu(t) and 
is unbounded. Example 22.5 discusses the case 
of a lossless LC circuit that is excited at the fre-
quency of its poles on the imaginary axis.
Example 22.5:  Responses of LC Circuit
Given a parallel LC circuit (Figure 22.14a), with zero ini-
tial conditions, excited by a current source, it is required 
to determine (a) the transfer function Vo(s)/Isrc(s), (b) 
vO in response to a unit current impulse, and (c) vO 
in response to a sinusoidal excitation of the same fre-
quency as the poles.

conservation of energy. Since the amplitude of oscil-

The response is now unbounded, because the 
frequency of excitation is the same as that of the 
poles of the circuit. Note that in this case, it is 
not possible to solve the problem using phasors, 
because the circuit never reaches a steady state, as 
required by phasor analysis.

tion to the second circuit at its resonant frequency. 
This is illustrated by the following simulation.
Simulation: The Schematic is entered as in Figure 22.15, 
where the first circuit, having L = 1 H and C = 0.1 mF is 
excited by a current impulse of strength 104 × 10−7 = 10−3 As. 
The second LC circuit is identical with the first circuit and 
is excited by the output of the first circuit though a VCCS. 
In this way, the first circuit is not loaded by the second cir-
cuit, and this circuit is excited at the frequency of the pole. 
The negative sign of the gain of the dependent source is 
to compensate for the reversed connection of the control-
ling voltage of this source. In the simulation profile, Time 
Domain (Transient) is chosen as the Analysis type, 1s is 
entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving data after’, 
and 0.1m for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simulation is 
run, the waveforms of Figure 22.16 are displayed, where 
the dashed sinusoid is the voltage across the first LC circuit. 
The voltage jumps to 10 V at the end of the impulse and 
continues as a cosine function of 10 V amplitude, as indi-
cated by the voltage scale on the RHS of the graph. This is in 
accordance with the impulse flowing through the capacitor 
and depositing a charge of 10−3 C, which results in a voltage 
of 10−3/10−4 = 10 V. The measured period is 62.617 ms, cor-
responding to a frequency of 15.97 Hz, compared to a calcu-
lated value of 15.92 Hz. As indicated by the voltage marker, 
the output of the second circuit is unbounded, starting from 
zero and reaching 43.3 kV at 1 s. It should be noted that in 
order to have the two voltages on the same display, the out-
put of the first circuit is selected as V(C1:1) * 2E03.
22.3.2  Sinusoidal Steady-State Response
The transfer function applies to a circuit having no initial 
energy storage. In the sinusoidal steady state, any initial 
stored energy would have died down by the time the 
steady state is established. Moreover, the frequencies of 
sinusoidal functions are represented on the imaginary 
axis of the s-plane, where s = jω. It should be possible 
therefore to derive the sinusoidal steady-state response 
from the transfer function by substituting s = jω. It is 
shown in this section how this can be accomplished.

Consider a stable circuit to which a sinusoidal excitation 
x(t) = Xmcosωt is applied. Let the transfer function of the 
circuit be a proper rational function H(s). If the transfer 
function is not a proper rational function, then H(s) refers 
to the proper rational fraction part, after dividing the 
numerator by the denominator. This is justified by the fact 
that the quotient is terms in s or powers of s, representing 
an impulse and its higher derivatives, which are zero at 
t = 0+. However, the response Y(s) of the circuit contains, 
in general, transients for t > 0+. H(s) can be expressed as

where U(s) represents terms whose denominators 
involve the roots of D(s). To determine K1, we proceed in 
the usual manner by multiplying both sides by (s − jω) 
and substituting s = jω. All terms on the RHS, except K1 
will go to zero, including the terms (s − jω)U(s). This is 
because the circuit is assumed to be stable, which means 
that there are no poles at s = ±jω. Such poles will make 
the circuit metastable, and if excited at this ­frequency, 
the response will be unbounded, as discussed ear-
lier. It follows from Equation 22.63, with H(s) replac-
ing N(s)/D(s), and substituting s  = jω after cancelling 
out (s − jω) from the numerator and denominator, that

It is seen that the steady-state sinusoidal response can be 
obtained from the transfer function, in accordance with 
the following concept:
Concept: The sinusoidal steady-state response is obtained 
from a transfer function that is a proper rational function by 
substituting s = jω, multiplying the magnitude of the excita-
tion by |H(jω)| and adding the phase angle of H(jω) to that 
of the excitation.

where account has been taken of the signs of the real and

The factors of H(jω) of Equation 22.71 can be inter-
preted geometrically in the s-plane. It is more instruc-
tive for this purpose to factor the quadratic expression 
in the denominator of Equation 22.70 into its complex

s  =  jω is represented by point ‘Q’ at a distance +ω 
on the imaginary axis. Each of the factors on the 
RHS of Equation 22.75 can be represented as a vec-
tor (Figure 22.17). Thus, (−2  +  jω) is the vector zQ. 
It is the sum of the vector zO, which is −2, and 
the vector jω. Similarly, p3Q  =  p3O  +  OQ  =  3  +  jω; 
p2Q = 1 + j(ω − 2); and p1Q = 1 + j(ω + 2). These vectors

It should be kept in mind that the response to a dc 
voltage or current excitation is equivalent to a sinusoi-
dal excitation of zero frequency. The dc response can 
therefore be obtained by multiplying the dc excitation 
by H(0), that is, the transfer function H(s) with s set to 
zero (see Primal Exercise 22.8).
22.3.3  Interpretation of Zeros and Poles
It is seen from the preceding discussion that ­physically 
realizable frequencies in the form of trigonometric 
­functions such as cosωt or sinωt are those that lie on the 
imaginary axis of the s-plane, with the origin represent-
ing ω = 0, or dc conditions. A frequency ω is represented 
on the imaginary axis by two points, +jω and −jω corre-
sponding to ejωt and e–jωt. These combine to form a trigo-
nometric function as explained in Section 16.2. Zeros of 
the form s

and make the transfer function equal to zero at a fre-

22.4  Interpretations of Circuit 
Responses in the s-Domain
22.4.1  Natural Responses of First-Order Circuits
Figure 22.18 shows an RL circuit in the s-domain, assum-
ing zero initial conditions. It follows from KVL that

where τ  =  L/R is the time constant. If the applied 
excitation is a voltage impulse of strength K Vs, then 
Vsrc(s) = K, and the impulse establishes an initial cur-
rent K/L in the inductor at t = 0+, resulting in a natural 
response for t ≥ 0+. Substituting for Vsrc(s) in Equation 
22.76 gives

It will be noted that all the responses I(s), VR(s), and 
VL(s) have a pole at s = −1/τ, which is also the root of 
the characteristic equation, in accordance with the dis-
cussion at the beginning of the preceding section. Thus, 
the differential equation with zero forcing function is 
L di
dt
Ri
+
= 0. Taking the LT, with zero initial conditions, 
gives (sL + R)I(s) = 0. The characteristic equation is there-
fore sL + R = 0, whose root is s = −1/τ.
Concept: All the responses of a stable first-order circuit in the 
s-domain are characterized by a pole on the negative real axis 
whose magnitude is the reciprocal of the time constant.
This is illustrated in Figure 22.19. As R → 0, 1/τ → 0, 
and the pole approaches the origin in the s-plane. The 
transfer function I(s)/Vsrc(s) reduces to 1/sL, the admit-
tance of an uncharged inductor. As R increases, the pole 
moves along the negative real axis, away from the origin.
Primal Exercise 22.6
If L = 1 H in the circuit of Figure 22.18, determine how 
the pole moves along the negative real axis as R varies 
between 1 and 100 Ω.

where τ = RC. HI(s), being an admittance, has a zero at 
s = 0 and a pole at s = −1/τ. The zero occurs at a ­frequency 
ω = 0 which corresponds to dc conditions. Under dc con-
ditions, the capacitor behaves as an open circuit, so that 
the admittance is zero. At any frequency s = jω, the admit-
tance is HI(jω) = 1/(R + 1/jωC), as obtained using phasor 
analysis. Note that impedance and admittance in terms of 
jω are defined under sinusoidal steady-state conditions. 
The pole is on the negative real axis. Formally, HI(s) → ∞ 
at s  =  −1/τ, but this does not occur at any physically 
­realizable frequency, because such frequencies are only 
represented on the imaginary axis of the s-plane.
If the excitation is a voltage step Ku(t), Vsrc(s) = K/s.

Simulation: This example illustrates the direct simulation 
of a transfer function using the part named LAPLACE 
from the PSpice Analog Behavioral Module (ABM) library. 
When this part is entered, a block is displayed having the 
default transfer function 1/(s + 1), but the numerator and 
denominator can be changed to the desired polynomial 
in s (Figure 22.21a). The transfer function s/(s + 1) corre-
sponds to K = 1 Vs, C = 1 F, and R = 1 Ω in  Equation 
22.83. To invert the transfer function, a unit impulse 
function is applied at the IN terminal and the output is 
derived at the OUT terminal. In the simulation profile, 
Time Domain (Transient) is chosen as the Analysis type, 5s 
is entered for ‘Run to time’, 0 for ‘Start saving data after’, 
and 0.5m for ‘Maximum step size’. After the simulation 
is run, the setting of the x-axis is changed by choosing 
Plot/Axis Settings/X-axis, then selecting User Defined 
and replacing the lower value of 0 by 10ms, in order to 
hide the initial transient. The plot of Figure 22.22 is dis-
played corresponding to the response after the impulse in 
Equation 22.84. Note that the output is interpreted as a 
voltage, but the transfer function is that of a current, so 
that the ordinates in Figure 22.22 are in fact in amperes.
To display the steady-state sinusoidal response, the 
schematic of Figure 22.21b is entered, representing 
an arbitrarily chosen input of 10cost V and the same 
transfer function. The simulation profile is changed to 
AC Sweep (Noise), with start and end frequencies of 
0.159155, and 1 point per decade. After the simulation is 
run, the voltage printer readings in the output file are a 
magnitude of 7.071 V and a phase angle of 45°, in accor-
dance with Equation 22.86.

decreases, the poles move closer together on the real axis,

sponding to critical damping (α = ω0 as in Figure 22.24b).

a  semicircle. The response is now underdamped. As 
R becomes smaller still, the poles move closer to the 
imaginary axis. In the limiting case of R = 0, α = 0, and 
the poles become purely imaginary at ±jw0.
Concept: The poles of an overdamped second-order circuit lie 
on the negative real axis of the s-plane. A critically damped 
circuit has a double pole on the negative real axis, at a distance 
ω0 from the origin. The poles of an underdamped circuit occur 
in complex conjugate pairs in the left half of the s-plane, on a 
semicircle of radius ω0 centered on the origin.

Vmcosθ and C behaves as a short circuit in response to 
this step input at t = 0, irrespective of whether or not ω

It should be noted that whereas in the steady state

The steady-state value ILss(s) cannot be obtained by

However, the only terms of interest in the PFE of IL(s)

Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 In the s-domain, the impedance of a resistor is R, 
that of an uncharged capacitor is 1/sC, and that 
of an uncharged inductor is sL. To account for ini-
tial energy storage, while considering the values 
of all responses to be zero at t = 0−, in accordance 
with the single-sided LT, step or impulse, ideal, 
independent sources are added in series or in 
parallel with the ideal energy storage element so 
as to provide the required initial value at t = 0+.
•	 The sources that are added to account for initial 
conditions in the energy storage elements in the 
s-domain become an integral part of the representa-
tion of the energy storage element in the s-domain.
•	 The s-domain representation of the linear trans-
former is based on the T-equivalent circuit. The 
ideal voltage source representation of the initial 
current in an inductor is applied to the induc-
tors in the series and shunt branches of the 
T-equivalent circuit.
•	 All circuit laws and techniques, discussed pre-
viously for the frequency domain using phasor 
notation, apply equally well to the s-domain. 
These include series and parallel combina-
tions of s-domain impedances and admittances; 
node-voltage, mesh-current, and loop-current 
methods of analysis; TEC and NEC; and super-
position and Y-Δ transformation.
	
1.	 In the s-domain, passive circuit elements are 
represented by their s-domain impedances, 

676	
Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
with initial values of voltages across capaci-
tors and currents though inductors accounted 
for by appropriate sources. Independent and 
dependent voltage or current sources are 
expressed in terms of their LTs.
	
2.	 The circuit is then analyzed by any of the 
techniques described previously for pha-
sor analysis, and the LT of the desired 
circuit response is derived by solving alge-
braic equations for the LT of the desired 
responses.
	
3.	 The ILT of the desired response gives the 
complete response in the time domain, both 
transient and steady state, to any arbitrary 
excitation that has an LT.
•	 In switching problems that involve impulsive 
readjustments at the instant of switching, initial 
values in energy storage elements just before 
switching are used in the s-domain representa-
tion of the circuit after switching. The initial-
value theorem gives circuit responses just after 
switching.
•	 When a single excitation is applied to a given 
circuit having no initial energy storage, the 
transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the LT Y(s) 
of a designated response to the LT X(s) of the 
applied excitation.
•	 The LT of the response to a unit impulse of exci-
tation is the transfer function, and the ILT of 
the transfer function is the response in the time 
domain to a unit impulse of excitation.
•	 The poles of the transfer function are the roots 
of the characteristic.
•	 A circuit is stable if the response to a unit impulse 
tends to zero as t → ∞. The circuit is unstable if 
the response to a unit impulse increases with-
out limit, that is, is unbounded as t → ∞. The 
circuit is marginally stable, or metastable, if as 
t → ∞, the response to a unit impulse does not 
approach zero but remains bounded.
•	 If all the poles of the transfer function lie in the 
open left half of the s-plane, the circuit is stable. 
If at least one pole lies in the open right half of 
the s-plane, the circuit is unstable. If all the poles 
of the transfer function are simple poles on the 
imaginary axis, the circuit is metastable. If at 
least one pole on the imaginary axis is a mul-
tiple pole, the circuit is unstable.
•	 If a metastable circuit is excited at the frequency 
of its poles on the imaginary axis, the response 
in unbounded.
•	 The sinusoidal steady-state response is obtained 
from a transfer function that is a proper rational 
function by substituting s  =  jω, multiplying the 
magnitude of the excitation by |H(jω)| and add-
ing the phase angle of H(jω) to that of the excita-
tion. As ω is varied, s moves along the imaginary 
axis.
•	 All the responses of a stable first-order circuit 
in the s-domain are characterized by a pole on 
the negative real axis whose magnitude is the 
reciprocal of the time constant.
•	 The poles of an overdamped second-order cir-
cuit lie on the negative real axis of the s-plane. 
A critically damped circuit has a double pole 
on the real axis. The poles of an underdamped 
circuit occur in complex conjugate pairs at a 
­distance ω0 from the origin.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	Always include the sources that account for ini-
tial conditions in energy storage elements as an 
integral part of these elements when analyzing 
the circuit.
	
2.	In delayed switching, the LT implicitly assumes 
a time origin at t = 0.

Objective and Overview
Although the Laplace transform (LT) has several advan-
tages over the Fourier transform (FT) in circuit analysis, 
the FT is fundamental to signal analysis. Being concep-
tually an extension of Fourier analysis to nonperiodic 
signals, it utilizes the same frequency-domain represen-
tation as phasor analysis. It shares many of the opera-
tional properties of the LT but has some unique and very 
useful properties that are explored in this chapter.
The FT provides a powerful tool for working in the fre-
quency domain. This has many important applications in 
signal processing, communications, and control systems. 
The usefulness of FT techniques has been greatly enhanced 
by digital computation, based on a rapid and efficient algo-
rithm known as the fast Fourier transform that computes 
the discrete FT (DFT). This transform is an approximation 
to the FT that produces a finite set of discrete-frequency 
spectrum values from a finite set of discrete-time values.
The FT is first derived from the Fourier series expan-
sion (FSE) and its salient characteristics are highlighted. 
Some general properties of the FT and their implications 
are then presented followed by the operational proper-
ties of the FT and their applications. Circuit applications 
of the FT are discussed and compared with those of the 
LT. This chapter ends with Parseval’s theorem, which is 
concerned with energy in the frequency domain.
23.1  Derivation of the Fourier Transform
The FT can be derived from the exponential form of 
the FSE of a periodic waveform as the period becomes 
­infinitely large. Consider as an example the FSE of the 
rectangular pulse train analyzed in Example 16.3. As the 
period of the function becomes infinitely large, the wave-
form reduces to a single pulse of amplitude A and dura-
tion t , extending from t = -t/2 to t = +t/2, often denoted 
by Arect (t/t ), as mentioned earlier. Cn of the waveform 
is given by C

Since T will be made very large and ω0 correspondingly 
very small, let us consider C T
n  instead of Cn. Thus, from

As T ® ¥, the function becomes the aperiodic func-
tion Arect(t/τ), and the separation ω0 = 2π/T between 
neighboring spectral lines becomes an infinitesimal dω. 
The abscissa nω0 becomes ω, so that its infinitesimal 
variation is dω. Equation 23.1 becomes

The following should be noted concerning the Fourier 
transformation:
	
1.	The FT can be interpreted along the same 
line as the FSE. The frequency spectrum of 
a periodic function is discrete, defined at 
frequencies nω0, the amplitude of the nth 
­harmonic being 2|Cn|. On the other hand, 
as  T
C

w
w
p
w becomes 
infinitesimally small, and the frequency sepa-
ration ω0 also becomes infinitesimal; that is, 
the amplitudes of the sinusoids are now a con-
tinuous function of frequency instead of being 
defined as harmonic only at the discrete fre-
quencies nω0. The periodic function is the sum 
of a denumerably infinite number of sinusoids 
of finite amplitude, successively separated in 
frequency by ω0. The aperiodic function can be 
viewed as the sum of a nondenumerably infi-
nite number of sinusoids of infinitesimal ampli-
tude and infinitesimal frequency separation. 
The amplitude of each of these components is 
F
d
w
p
w
( )
(
)
/
 and its phase is that of F(ω). The 
distinction between a denumerably infinite and 
a nondenumerably infinite number of sinusoids 
is that a denumerably infinite number is, in 
principle, countable, as 1, 2, 3, … all the way to 
infinity. On the other hand, when the frequency 
is continuous, counting of sinusoids, even over 
a finite frequency range, is nondenumerably 
infinite. The counting becomes impossible, even 
in principle, because of infinitesimal frequency 
separation.
	
2.	Sufficient conditions for the existence of the 
FT are as follows: (a) 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is finite, that 
is, |f(t)| is absolutely integrable, and (b) the 
function is piecewise continuous on a finite 
interval of time, as in the case of the LT, which 
means that the function is integrable over any 
finite interval. These conditions are sufficient 
but not necessary, so that functions for which 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is infinite can have an FT. Examples 
are dc quantities, step functions, and sinusoi-
dal functions. The FTs of these functions can-
not be obtained directly using Equation 23.3 
but are obtained in other ways, as illustrated 
later.
	
3.	Compared to the one-sided LT of Equation 21.3, 
the FT is defined from t = -¥ to t = +¥, with s 
in the LT replaced by jω. The extension over all 
time means that values of functions for t < 0 are 
included in the FT, but initial conditions at t = 0 
are not easily included. Moreover, because of the 
e
t
-s  in the LT integral, where σ is the real part of 
s, the LT integral converges for more functions 
than does the FT integral. As a consequence, 
functions such as tu(t) have an LT but not an FT.

Fourier Transform	
689
	
4.	The importance of the FT in signal analysis 
stems from the fact that it transforms a time 
function extending over all time, from t = -¥ to 
t = +¥, to the frequency domain, thereby yield-
ing a true representation of the frequency con-
tent of the function. Strictly speaking, a dc or a 
sinusoidal signal extends from t = -¥ to t = +¥. In 
order to portray the frequency content of such 
signals through a transformation from the time 
domain, the transformation should include all 
time, as in the FT.
	
5.	Some signal processing applications involve 
the FT in terms of spatial coordinates in 
two or three dimensions rather than time. 
Equation 23.3 applies in this case for each 
spatial ­coordinate, with the spatial coordinate 
­replacing t.
	
6.	The FT can have a physical representation. For 
example, if an image on a transparent film is 
placed at the focal point of a convex lens and 
illuminated by coherent light, as from a laser, 
the image seen at the other focal point is the 
two-dimensional spatial FT of the image on 
the transparency. In fact, when monochromatic 
x-rays, that is, x-rays of a single frequency, are 
diffracted by a crystal, the diffraction pattern 
is the FT of the three-dimensional crystal struc-
ture for that particular angle of incidence of 
the x-rays.
We illustrate in what follows the derivation of the FT 
of some basic functions, starting with a unit impulse δ(t) 
at the origin. It follows from Equation 23.3 that

as for the LT.
We next derive the FT of f(t) = 1, a constant. In this 
case 
f t dt
( )

+¥ò
 is infinite, so the FT cannot be obtained 
directly from Equation 23.3 but can be derived from 
Equation 23.5. According to this equation, the IFT of 1 is 
δ(t). Applying the inverse transform relation (Equation 
23.4) to 1 and setting this equal to δ(t),

and is an impulse of strength 2π at ω = 0 in the fre-
quency domain. This is to be expected because the con-
stant 1 can be considered as a dc signal that extends 
from t = -¥ to t = +¥. A dc signal is of zero frequency, so 
that its representation in the frequency domain should 
be at the point ω  =  0 only, which is an impulse. On 
the other hand, it was pointed out in connection with 
Equation 16.40, that if the pulse is narrow enough, 
fundamental and harmonics all have essentially the 
same amplitude. In the limit, an impulse at t = 0, being 
of infinitesimal duration, has a frequency spectrum 
extending over all frequencies, and with all these fre-
quency components having the same relative ampli-
tude. Its FT is therefore a constant extending from −∞ 
to +∞, as in Equation 23.5.

The FT of cosw0t is therefore two impulse functions, 
one at w
w

0 and the other at w
w
= -
0, each of strength p. 
Since a function cosw0t that extends from t = -¥ to t = +¥ 
has a single frequency component ω0, it is represented 
by impulses in the frequency domain at w
w
= ±
0. As 
discussed in connection with the exponential form of 
Fourier series (Section 16.2), the positive and negative

In this case, the impulse function at ω = −ω0 has a phase 
angle of π/2, whereas the impulse function at ω  = ω0 
has a phase angle of −π/2. The sine function is thus 90° 
out of phase with the cosine function, as it should be. 
As ω0 decreases, the two impulses of the FT of a cosine 
function come closer to the origin. When ω0 = 0, the two 
impulses add at the origin to give a single impulse of 
strength 2π, which is the FT of unity. In the time domain, 
as ω0 decreases, cosω0t becomes “flatter,” as illustrated 
in Figure 23.2a for cosω0t and for cos0.25ω0t. As ω0 → 0, 
cosω0t → 1, whose FT is 2π. In the case of sinω0t, the two 
impulses are 180° out of phase, so they cancel out at the 
origin, when ω0 = 0, giving a zero FT. In the time domain, 
sinω0t becomes “flatter” as ω0 decreases (Figure 23.2b). 
As ω0 → 0, sinω0t → 0, so the FT is zero.
As in the case of the LT, MATLAB can be used to find 
the FT and IFT. For example, if we enter
>> syms t w
>> fourier(sin(2*t))
MATLAB returns
>> −pi*(dirac(w - 2) - dirac(w + 2))*i
where Dirac() denotes δ() and i denotes j. If we then 
enter
>> ifourier(−pi*(dirac(w - 2) - dirac(w + 2)))
MATLAB returns
>> (1/exp(2*x*i))/2 - exp(2*x*i)/2,
which is cosx.

23.2  Some General Properties 
of the Fourier Transform
23.2.1  Real and Imaginary Parts
It should be emphasized that, according to Equation 
23.3, F(ω) is, in general, a complex quantity. In practice, 
f(t) is always a real function of time, so that

The following may be deduced from the preceding 
relations:
Deductions:
	
1.	The real part of F(ω) is even, since A(ω) = A(−ω).
	
2.	The imaginary part of F(ω) is odd, since 
B(ω) = −B(−ω).
	
3.	The magnitude of F(ω), which is A

4.	The phase angle of F(ω), which is tan-

, 
is odd.
	
5.	Replacing ω by −ω gives the complex conjugate of 
F(ω), that is, F(−ω) = F*(ω).
	
6.	If f(t) is even, f(t)cosωt is an even function of t, 
and f(t)sinωt is an odd function of t, which 
makes B(ω) = 0. Hence, F(ω) is real and even, 
with A
f t

w
( ) =

.
	
7.	If f(t) is odd, f(t)cosωt is an odd function of t, 
and f(t)sinωt is an even function of t, which 
makes A(ω) = 0. Hence, F(ω) is imaginary and 
odd, with B

For example, F{cosω0t} is real and even (Equation 23.11), 
whereas F{sinω0t} is imaginary and odd (Equation 23.12). 
Similarly, the FT of rect(t/τ) is real and even (Equation 
23.2), and the FT of two antisymmetrical pulses is imagi-
nary and odd (Equation 23.13).
23.2.2  Fourier Transform at Zero Frequency
If ω = 0 in Equation 23.3,
	
F
f t dt
0( ) =
( )
-¥
¥ò
	
(23.17)
That is, the value of FT at ω = 0 is the net positive area 
subtended by f(t). This area is the average, or dc compo-
nent, of f(t) multiplied by the interval over which f(t) ≠ 0.
It should be emphasized at this stage that consider-
able confusion concerning relations involving the FT 
can be avoided if a distinction is made between (1) 
“well-behaved” functions for which 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is finite, 
which is one of the sufficient conditions for the existence 
of the FT, and (2) functions for which 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is infi-
nite, in which case F(ω), if it exists, cannot be obtained 
directly from Equation 23.3. In this case, the FT gener-
ally has impulses. Since Equation 23.17 is derived from 
Equation 23.3, the following should be noted:
	
1.	If 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is finite, if f(t) is of finite duration, 
and if the dc component of f(t) is zero, then 
F(0) = 0. This can serve as a useful check on the 
FTs of such functions. For example, f(t) of Figure 
23.3 has a finite 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
, is of finite duration, 
and has zero dc. According to Equation 23.17, 
its F(0) must be zero. Substituting ω  =  0 in 
Equation 23.13 gives F(0) = 0/0, which is inde-
terminate. However, according to L’Hopital’s 
rule, F(0) can be obtained by first differentiating 
the numerator and denominator of the function, 
separately with respect to ω, before substituting 
ω = 0. Differentiating the numerator of Equation 
23.13 with respect to ω gives Asinωτ/2, and dif-
ferentiating the denominator with respect to ω 
gives j. Substituting ω = 0 results in F(0) = 0, as 
expected.

2.	On the other hand, if 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is infinite, and 
even if the dc component of f(t) is zero, it does 
not follow that F(0)  =  0. For example, a sig-
num function (Example 23.3) has an infinite 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
, and zero dc component, yet F(0) ≠ 0 
(Equation 23.19). In the case of cosω0t and sinω0t, 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is also infinite. The dc component is 
zero because it equals a finite area, which is at 
most that of half a period, divided by an infi-
nite duration, as t → ∞; F(0) = 0 for sinω0t and 
cosω0t, since the impulses occur at ω = ±ω0 and 
the FT is zero at ω = 0.
F(0) plays an important role in the FT, as illustrated 
by the following examples and by the differentiation-
in-time and integration-in-time properties discussed 
later.

It is seen that the FT of u(t) has an impulse at 
ω  =  0 because of the dc component of 1/2. As 
explained previously, a dc signal has only a single 
frequency at ω = 0; hence the impulse δ(ω). The FTs 
of both u(t) and sgn(t) have frequency components 
for ω > 0, represented by the 1/jω term. These fre-
quency components are due to the sudden jump 
of both functions at t = 0. sgn(t) does not have an 
impulse at ω = 0 because it can be considered as 
the sum of u(t) and −u(−t). In effect, the impulses 
of these two functions cancel out at ω = 0.

­Equation 23.23.
F(ω) is the FT of f(t), as usual. F(t) is a time function 
that has the same waveform as F(ω), with ω replaced 
by t. f(−ω) is the FT of F(t) and has the same waveform 
as f(t) with t replaced by −ω. If f(t) is an even function,

To illustrate duality, consider f(t) = δ(t), the unit impulse at 
the origin (Figure 23.9a). Its FT is F(ω) = 1 (Figure 23.9b). The 
time function that is of the same waveform as F(ω) is F(t) = 1 
(Figure 23.9c). Its FT is 2πδ(ω), which is the same as 2πδ(−ω) 
(Figure 23.9d), since the unit impulse at the origin is an even 
function. The function 2πδ(−ω) is 2πf(−ω), in accordance 
with Equation 23.23. A similar result is obtained if f(t) = 1, in 
which case F(ω) = 2πδ(ω). The function F(t) = 2πδ(t). Its FT is 
2π, which is an even function and is 2πf(−ω).
As an illustration of duality involving an odd func-
tion of time, consider f(t) = sint (Figure 23.10a). Its FT is 
F(ω) = jπδ(ω + 1) − jπδ(ω − 1), illustrated in Figure 23.10b.

Concept: If a function is compressed in the time domain, it 
expands in the frequency domain, and conversely.
This follows from Equation 23.28. For example, the FT 
of a rectangular pulse of width τ, extending from −τ/2 to 
+τ/2, is (Aτ)sinc(ωτ/2) (Equation 23.2), as illustrated in 
Figure 23.12a. If the pulse width is doubled to 2τ (Figure 
23.12b), the width of the FT is halved, as indicated by

the successive zero crossings occurring at half the fre-
quencies as in Figure 23.12a. Conversely, if the width of 
the rectangular pulse is halved, the width of the FT is 
doubled. As a practical application, if a voice recording 
is played back at double speed, for example, its duration 
is halved and its bandwidth is therefore doubled. This 
means that corresponding frequencies are doubled, so 
that the pitch of the voice is doubled.

An interesting application of the translation-in-time 
property is the distortionless delay. Consider a circuit 
having a magnitude frequency response K indepen-
dent of frequency and a phase frequency response that 
is directly proportional to frequency that is −aω. If the 
FT of the input is denoted by F(ω) = |F(ω)|∠F(ω), then 
the FT of the output is K|F(ω)|∠F(ω) − aω = e−jωaF(ω). It 
follows from Equation 23.32 that the output in the time 
domain is Kf(t − a), that is, the output is scaled by K but 
delayed in time by a.
Example 23.4:  Derivation of Fourier Transform 
of Biphasic Pulse from That of a Rectangular Pulse
It is required to obtain the FT of the function of Figure 23.3 
from that of a symmetrical rectangular pulse.
Solution:
From Equation 23.2, the FT of a rectangular pulse 
of duration τ centered at t  =  0 is (2A/ω)sin(ωτ/2) 
(Equation 23.2). Replacing τ by τ/2, the FT becomes 
(2A/ω)sin(ωτ/4). If the pulse is delayed by τ/4, its FT 
is 2

Example 23.5:  Fourier Transform of Periodic Function
It is required to obtain the FT of a periodic signal from 
the exponential form of its FSE.

As to be expected, the FT of the discrete frequen-
cies of a periodic signal is an infinite series of impulses 
weighted by the Fourier coefficient Cn. As an example, 
consider the delayed square wave of Figure 16.14a. From 
Exercise 16.8, Cn = 0, for n even or zero, and −j2Am/πn, 
for odd n. Its FT is therefore

If f(t) is a constant K, df(t)/dt = 0 for all values of K. 
F{K} = 2πKδ(ω) and F{dK/dt} = (jω)2πKδ(ω) = 0. This is 
because δ(ω) = 0 for ω ≠ 0, and when ω = 0, 0 × δ(ω) = 0. 
It follows that the differentiation-in-time property gives 
the same value of F{df(t)/dt} when a constant K is added 
to f(t). Thus, in the case of (1/2)sgn(t), the derivative is 
δ(t) so that the differentiation-in-time property gives

According 
to 
the differentiation-in-time property, multiplying the 
RHS of Equation 23.36 by jω should give F(ω). This is 
clearly the case, for multiplying the RHS by jω gives 
F(ω) + jωπF(0)δ(ω) = F(ω) + 0. Intuitively, if f(t) includes 
a constant, the FT of its integral would include a term in 
δ(ω). The form of πF(0)δ(ω) in Equation 23.36 can be justi-
fied by considering f(t) = δ(t), so that F(ω) = 1 and F(0) = 1. 
Applying Equation 23.36 gives F{u(t)}  =  1/jω  +  πδ(ω), 
which is the correct expression.
Primal Exercise 23.10
Verify the differentiation-in-time and integration-in-
time properties for cosωt and sinωt. Note that multipli-

F(ω), and conversely.

As an example of the convolution-in-time property, 
consider f(t)  =  Arect(t/τ), convolved with itself, as in 
Example 20.6. The convolution integral (Figure 20.35) 
is reproduced in Figure 23.18. This is the same triangu-
lar waveform considered in Exercise 23.11. Its FT can 
be obtained from Equation 23.37 by replacing τ/2 by τ 
and A by A2τ. This gives A2τ2sinc2(ωτ/2). The FT of f(t) = 
Arect(t/τ) is, from Equation 23.2, Aτsinc(ωτ/2). When 
the FTs of each f(t) are multiplied together, in accordance 
with the convolution-in-time property, the product is 
A2τ2sinc2(ωτ/2), as it should be.

The convolution of a function with an impulse at the 
origin is the function itself (Equation 20.32), so the RHS 
of Equation 23.58 reduces to KF(ω).
Table 23.1 summarizes the basic properties of the FT, 
and Table 23.2 lists some useful FT pairs.
23.4  Circuit Applications of the Fourier 
Transform
Generally speaking, the LT transform is more useful 
than the FT transform in circuit applications because 
(1) it can easily account for initial conditions; (2) it 
provides a powerful tool for analyzing switched cir-
cuits, particularly those involving impulsive read-
justment at the instant of switching; and (3) some 
functions have an LT but not an FT. On the other hand, 
the FT is useful in some circuit analysis problems in 
that it can readily handle functions defined over all 
time, -¥ < < ¥
t
.
The general procedure of applying the FT in cir-
cuit analysis is a generalization of the phasor method. 
The circuit is represented in the frequency domain, as 
in ­phasor analysis, where R, L, and C are represented 
in terms of their impedances as R, jωL, and 1/jωC,

respectively. Phasor voltages and currents, including 
excitations, are replaced by their corresponding FTs. 
The usual circuit techniques are applied to derive the FT 
of any desired response. The IFT then gives the desired 
response in the time domain.
The transfer function H(ω) is defined in terms of the 
FT as:
	
H
Y
X
w
w
w
( ) =
( )
( )	
(23.59)
where X(ω) and Y(ω) are the FTs of the excitation and 
response, respectively. Equation 23.59 is the same 
as Equation 22.42 for the LT, with s replaced by ω. If 
x(t) = δ(t), X(ω) = 1 and the FT of the response y(t) is 
H(ω). Thus, the FT of the response h(t) to a unit impulse 
at t  =  0 is the transfer function H(ω), and the IFT of 
H(ω) is h(t).
Example 23.9:  Responses of RC Circuit
It is required to obtain the responses vR and vC in 
Figure 23.19 when vSRC is (a) d t( ) and (b) u(t).

The two transfer functions are independent of the type 
of excitation. Thus,

To find the IFT of the first term, we express it 
in the form of partial fractions (Section 21.3). 
Although unnecessary in this case, it is usually 
more convenient when finding the partial frac-
tion expansion (PFE) to substitute s = jω, deter-
mine the PFE, and substitute back for s. The 
first term in terms of partial fractions involv-
ing s becomes

determine K1 we multiply both sides by s and 
substitute s  =  0. This gives K1  =  1. To deter-
mine K2 we multiply both sides by (1/τ)  +  s 
and substitute s  =  −1/τ, which gives K2  =  −1.

Evidently, there is no real advantage in obtaining the 
steady-state response to cosω0t using the FT, because 
the magnitude and phase of the output with respect to 
the input are given by H(ω).
Problem-Solving Tip
•	 When deriving the IFT by PFE, it is convenient and 
less error prone to replace jω by s.

23.5  Parseval’s Theorem
The power dissipated in a resistor R by a voltage v(t) 
or a current i(t) is, respectively, v2(t)/R and Ri2(t). When 
R = 1 Ω, this power can be conveniently expressed as 
f 2(t), where f(t) could be voltage or current. The energy 
dissipated in the 1 Ω resistor over all time is then

The inner integral is F(−ω)  =  F*(jω). Substituting in 
Equation 23.63 gives Equation 23.60.
The following should be noted concerning Parseval’s 
theorem:
	
1.	Since |F(ω)| is even (Section 23.2), Equation 
23.60 could be equally expressed as
	
f

2.	The plot of |F(ω)|2 vs. ω is the energy spectrum 
of the signal. The energy in any frequency band 
from ω1 to ω2 is, from Equation 23.64,

(23.65)
Note that Equation 23.65 is used for W12, and 
not Equation 23.60, because it accounts for posi-
tive and negative frequencies. To use Equation 
23.60, we would have to integrate from −ω2 
to  −ω1 and  from ω1 to ω2. These integrals are 
equal because |F(ω)| is even, which leads to 
Equation 23.65.
	
3.	According to Equation 23.65, 
F j
d
w
p
w
(
)
2
 is the 
energy in an infinitesimal band of frequen-
cies dω, so that |F(ω)|2 is π times the energy 
per radian of bandwidth or twice the energy per 
hertz.
	
4.	Some types of time functions, such as random 
noise, are more conveniently represented in 
the frequency domain than in the time domain. 
Parseval’s theorem allows calculation of the 
power associated with any band of noise fre-
quencies and hence assesses the relative contri-
bution of such a band to the total noise energy.
	
5.	Because it establishes a direct relation between 
energy in the time domain and energy in the 
frequency domain, Parseval’s theorem implies 
conservation of power and energy in the fre-
quency domain.
	
6.	Signals having a finite 
f
t dt
2( )

 are referred to 
as energy signals. In the case of periodic sig-
nals, this integral tends to infinity.
Example 23.11:  Parseval’s Theorem
A voltage 4e–2tu(t) V is applied to a 20 Ω resistor. It is 
required to determine (a) the total energy dissipated in 
both the time and frequency domains, (b) the energy 
associated with the frequency band 0 < f < 10 Hz, and

circuit analysis is a generalization of the pha-

frequency domain, as in the phasor analysis, 
where R, L, and C are represented in terms of 
their impedances as R, jωL, and 1/jωC, respec-
tively. Phasor voltages and currents, including 
excitations, are replaced by the corresponding 
FTs. The usual circuit techniques are applied

•	 If f(t) is odd, F(ω) is imaginary and odd.
•	 If 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 is finite, if f(t) is of finite dura-
tion, and if the dc component of f(t) is zero, 
then F(0) = 0. On the other hand, if 
f t dt
( )
-¥
+¥ò
 
is infinite, and even if the dc component of 
f(t) is zero, it does not follow that F(0) = 0.
	
2.	When deriving the IFT by PFE, it is convenient 
and less error prone to replace jω by s.

Two-Port Circuits
Objective and Overview
Any circuit that is excited by a single, independent 
source applied to one port and having a load connected 
to another port can be considered as a two-port circuit. 
Active, electronic devices and their associated circuits 
are the prime examples of two-port circuits. A two-
port circuit is characterized, in general, by sets of four 
parameters defined in terms of open-circuit or short-
circuit terminations at each port. The analysis based on 
this characterization provides a useful and powerful 
alternative to conventional circuit analysis discussed in 
previous chapters.
To utilize the full power of two-port analysis, matrix 
methods are needed. We will introduce some of these 
methods in the following sections, mainly as a conve-
nient, compact notation that follows certain rules that 
are particularly simple for 2 × 2 matrices.
The chapter begins with presenting the six sets 
of two-port circuit equations, any one of which can 
be used to relate terminal voltages and currents of 
the circuit. Each of these sets of equations involves a 
­corresponding set of parameters that characterize the 
circuit. The different sets of parameters are interpreted 
in terms of terminal conditions of the circuit, and the 
relations between these different sets are derived. Two 
special types of two-port circuits, namely, reciprocal 
and symmetric circuits, are discussed, followed by 
­presenting some useful equivalent circuits based on 
two-port ­circuit equations.
The rest of the chapter is concerned with two-port cir-
cuit analysis, starting with the derivation of two-port 
circuit parameters for composite circuits that result 
from combining two-port circuits in one of five possible 
ways: cascading, parallel, series, series–­parallel, and 
parallel–series connections. When single circuit ele-
ments are considered as two-port circuits, this approach 
leads to some powerful methods of analyzing many 
types of circuits. The chapter ends by analyzing a ter-
minated two-port circuit in order to derive relations 
that are of particular interest in the analysis of electronic 
amplifier circuits.
24.1  Circuit Description
As its name implies, a two-port circuit has a pair of input 
terminals or input port and a pair of output terminals 
or output port (Figure 24.1), the assigned positive direc-
tions of input and output voltages and currents being as 
indicated. Voltages and currents in two-port circuits are 
considered, in general, to be Laplace transforms, unless 
indicated otherwise. These voltages and currents could 
equally well be dc quantities or phasors in the case of a 
sinusoidal steady state. By convention, the circuit may 
contain passive, linear circuit elements and dependent 
sources, but no independent sources.
In general, two of the four terminal variables, V1, V2, I1, 
and I2, can be specified independently, in which case the 
other two variables are determined by the parameters of 
the given circuit. This can be justified by considering a load 
connected to the output port. Evidently, V2 and I2 will be 
related by the load and will not be independent. Similarly, 
with the load connected, there will be an input imped-
ance at the input port that relates V1 and I1, which means 
that these two variables are not independent. Hence, only 
two of the four terminal variables are, in general, inde-
pendent. The two-port circuit may therefore be described 
in terms of two simultaneous equations. However, since 
four variables are involved, there are six ways of choos-
ing two of these variables as independent, which results 
in six sets of simultaneous equations, listed in Table 24.1. 
In each of these equations, the two independent variables 
on the LHS are related to two dependent variables on the 
RHS by four coefficients or parameters that characterize 
the equation. Thus, one speaks of the z-parameter equa-
tion, the y-parameter equation, etc. The two equations in

the same row in Table 24.1 are inversely related, in the 
sense that the independent variables in one set are the 
dependent variables in the other. As discussed in the fol-
lowing text, this means that the matrices of parameters in 
the two cases are inversely related.
It is seen from Table 24.1 that a two-port circuit is speci-
fied, in general, by four nonzero parameters in one of the 
six equations. The z and y parameters, being impedances 
and admittances, respectively, are immittance parameters, 
where immittance refers to either an impedance or admit-
tance. The z- and y-parameter equations express terminal 
voltages (or currents) in terms of terminal currents (or 
voltages). The a and b parameters are transmission param-
eters because the corresponding equations express voltage 
and current at one port in terms of voltage and current at 
the other port. The a and b parameters are also referred 
to as ABCD or abcd parameters, respectively. The h and 
g parameters are hybrid parameters because the corre-
sponding equations express an input voltage (or current) 
and an output current (or voltage) in terms of an input cur-
rent (or voltage) and an output voltage (or current).
Exercise 24.1
Of the six sets of equations in Table 24.1, which sets are 
dual relations?
Ans. z-parameter and y-parameter equations are dual 
relations, as are the h-parameter and g-parameter equa-
tions, provided the corresponding coefficients have 
equal numerical values.
24.2  Parameter Interpretation and Relations
24.2.1  Interpretation of Parameters
The parameters of two-port circuits can be interpreted 
in terms of voltage and current ratios under specified 
open-circuit and short-circuit terminations, which pro-
vide a convenient means of evaluation or measure-
ment of these parameters. If excitation is applied to 
port 1, with port 2 open-circuited, then I2 = 0, and the 
z-­parameter equations reduce to

tions reduce to

Whereas z11 and z22 are input impedances at ports 
1  and 2, respectively, z12 and z21 are transfer imped-
ances, being the ratio of voltage at one port to current 
at the other port. The other parameters may be simi-
larly interpreted, as summarized in Table 24.2. Circuit 
parameters are, in general, frequency dependent and 
complex.
Since the same circuit variables are involved in the 
six equations, the parameters in these equations must 
be related. To find the relation between any two sets of 
parameters, we simply express one set of two simul-
taneous equations in the same form as the other set 
and compare coefficients. For example, to express the 
TABLE 24.1
Two-Port Circuit Equations
V1 = z11I1 + z12I2
I1 = y11V1 + y12V2
V2 = z21I1 + z22I2
I2 = y21V1 + y22V2
V1 = a11V2 − a12I2
V2 = b11V1 − b12I1
I1 = a21V2 − a22I2
I2 = b21V1 − b22I1
V1 = h11I1 + h12V2
I1 = g11V1 + g12I2
I2 = h21I1 + h22V2
V2 = g21V1 + g22I2

. Table 24.3 shows the relations 
between the different sets of parameters.
Note that in certain cases, some parameters in a given 
set of the six sets of parameters may be zero, and some 
parameters in other sets of parameters may be infi-
nite, in which case, the corresponding set of two-port 
circuit equations does not exist. For example, the ideal 
transformer may be considered as a two-port circuit in 
which V2 and V1 are related by a turns ratio indepen-
dent of the currents and I1 and I2 are related by a turns 
ratio, independent of the voltages. For the dot markings 
indicated in Figure 24.2, the transformer equations are 
V1 = nV2 and I2 = −nI1. The two-port circuit equations

The z-parameter and y-parameter equations do not 
exist, as it is not possible to express the transformer volt-
ages in terms of the transformer currents or conversely 
based on the transformer equations alone. Referring to 
Table 24.3, if a12 = 0 = a21, then all the z parameters and 
y parameters are infinite.

in Equation 24.12 and of I1 in Equation 24.13 is simply 
the mutual impedance. Moreover, this mutual imped-
ance, Z3, is the same in the two mesh-current equations, 
because fundamentally the passive circuit elements of 
resistance, capacitance, and inductance are bilateral, 
that is, their values are independent of the direction of 
the current through them.
Next, let us substitute I

Equations 24.14 and 24.15 are the z-parameter equa-
tions of a two-port circuit having z12 = z21 = Z3, z11 = Z1 + Z3 
or Z1 = z11 – z12 and z22 = Z2 + Z3 or Z2 = z22 – z21, as shown 
in Figure 24.5b. We have thus shown that the z-parame-
ter equations are of the form of mesh-current equations, 
where I1 is a current flowing clockwise in an input mesh 
and I2 is a current flowing counterclockwise in an out-
put mesh. z11 and z22 are self-impedances of the meshes, 
whereas z12 and z21 are mutual impedances that are equal 
in the absence of dependent sources. Such a two-port cir-
cuit having z12 = z21 is said to be reciprocal.
Similarly, the y-parameter equations can be shown to 
be of the form of node-voltage equations. Consider, for 
example, the π-circuit of Figure 24.6a. The node-voltage 
equations are

Equations 24.17 and 24.18 are the y-parameter equa-
tions of a two-port circuit having y12 = y21 = −Y2, y11 = 
Y1 + Y2, or Y1 = y11 + y12 and y22 = Y2 + Y3 or Y3 = y22 + y21, 
as shown in Figure 24.6b. It is seen that the y-parameter 
equations are of the form of node-voltage equations, 
where y11 and y22 are self-admittances of the nodes, 
whereas y12 and  y21 are mutual admittances that are 
equal in the absence of dependent sources. This again 
defines a reciprocal ­circuit in terms of the y parameters 
as a circuit having y12 = y21.
Because of the relations between the various sets of 
two-port parameters, as shown in Table 24.3, the rela-
tions corresponding to z12 = z21 or y12 = y21 can be read-
ily derived for the other sets of parameters. Thus, if 
z12 = z21, it follows from Table 24.3 that Δa/a21 = 1/a21, 
1/b21 = Δb/b21, h12/h22 = −h21/h22, and −g12/g11 = g21/g11. 
These relations give D

Parameter relations in reciprocal circuits are summa-
rized in Table 24.4. It follows from these relations that in 
a reciprocal circuit, only three of the four circuit param-
eters are independent.
It should be noted that having no dependent sources 
in a two-port circuit is a sufficient condition for reciproc-
ity but not a necessary one. In other words, a circuit that 
does not have dependent sources is reciprocal. But a cir-
cuit can have dependent sources and still be reciprocal, 
depending on the values of circuit parameters, as illus-
trated by Example 24.3. Hence, we define a reciprocal 
circuit as follows:
Definition: A reciprocal circuit is one whose two-port param-
eters satisfy the reciprocity relations (Table 24.4).
24.2.4  Symmetric Circuits
Definition: A reciprocal circuit is symmetric if terminal volt-
ages and currents remain the same when the two ports are 
interchanged.

To determine the relations between parameters in such 
a circuit, consider, to begin with, the z-parameter equa-
tions. If V1 is interchanged with V2 in these equations

, since the circuit is reciprocal, Equations 
24.19 are identical to the original equations if z11 = z22. 
The same considerations apply to the y parameters so 
that the circuit is symmetric if y11 = y22. In a symmetric 
circuit, therefore, only two of the four circuit parameters 
are independent.
The relations between the other two-port parameters 
in a symmetric circuit may be derived by equating z11 = 
z22 or y11 = y22 in Table 24.3. These relations are summa-
rized in Table 24.5.
Exercise 24.5
(a) Verify the relations for the a, b, h, and g parameters 
in Table 24.5. (b) Show that the a and b parameters of a 
symmetric circuit are the same.
Example 24.3:  Symmetric Two-Port Circuit
It is required to determine (a) R and α in Figure 24.7 
so that the two-port circuit is symmetric and (b) the a 
parameters by simulation, with R = 3 Ω and α = 0.5.
Solution:
The procedure is to write Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) 
equations for the three meshes and then eliminate I3 so 
as to have two equations of the form of the z-parameter 
equations.
It follows from the figure that

z11 = 0.7 Ω, z12 = 0.2 Ω, z21 = −0.2 Ω, and z22 = 0.8 Ω. The 
circuit is neither symmetric nor reciprocal.
Simulation: The simulation is with the output port 
open-circuited and then short-circuited. The schematic 
for the former case is entered as in Figure 24.8. Although 
a 1 V source may be applied, it is convenient to use a 7 V 
in this case so as to obtain round figures for the voltages 
and currents. When the simulation is run, PSpice gives 
V2 = –2 V and I1 = 10 A. It follows that a11

Verify that the two-port circuit of Figure 24.7 is symmet-
ric if α = 1 and R = 0 or R = ¥. Express Equations 24.20

arbitrary R, and note that the matrix of coefficients is not

24.3  Equivalent Circuits
In the z-parameter, y-parameter, h-parameter, and 
g-parameter equations, the first equation expresses an 
input variable in terms of the other input variable and an 
output variable, whereas the second equation expresses 
an output variable in terms of the other output variable 
and an input variable. These two-port equations may 
therefore be represented by an equivalent circuit with 
appropriate dependent sources on the input and output 
sides, as illustrated in Figure 24.11a through d.
The two-port parameters can be readily interpreted in 
terms of these circuits. For example, in the case of the 
z-parameter circuit, if port 2 is open-circuited, the depen-
dent voltage source z12I2 = 0, so that the input impedance 
is z11, and V2 equals the source voltage z21I1. In general, 
the ‘11’ subscript parameter describes an input imped-
ance or admittance when the dependent source on the 
input side is set to zero, which imposes an open circuit 
or a short circuit at the output port. Similarly, the ‘22’ 
subscript parameter describes an output impedance or 
admittance when the dependent source on the output 
side is set to zero, which imposes an open circuit or a 
short circuit at the input port.
The effect of the input on the output side, that is, the 
forward transmission, is expressed by the dependent

source on the output side and its associated ‘21’ sub-
script parameter. On the other hand, the effect of the 
output on the input side, that is, the reverse transmission, 
is expressed by the dependent source on the input side 
and its associated ‘12’ subscript parameter.
The equivalent circuits of Figure 24.11 are of interest 
in that they represent the four possible types of elec-
tronic amplifiers, as represented by the ‘21’ dependent 
sources. Thus, the circuit of Figure 24.11d is that of a 
voltage amplifier of input voltage V1 and open-circuit 
output voltage g21V1, the voltage gain being g21. The 
circuit of Figure 24.11c is that of a current amplifier of 
input current I1 and short-circuit output current h21I1, 
the current gain being h21. The circuit of Figure 24.11b 
is that of a transconductance amplifier of input volt-
age V1 and short-circuit output current y21V1. Finally, 
the circuit of Figure 24.11a is that of a transresistance 
­amplifier of input current I1 and open-circuit output 
voltage z21I1.
As discussed in the preceding section, a reciprocal, 
two-port circuit having a common terminal between 
input and output may be represented by a T-equivalent 
circuit in terms of the z parameters (Figure 24.5b) or 
by a π-equivalent circuit in terms of the y-parameters 
(Figure 24.6b). If the circuit is nonreciprocal, dependent 
sources can be added to these T- and π-circuits to obtain 
the corresponding equivalent circuits, as illustrated by 
Example 24.4.

24.4  Composite Two-Port Circuits
Concept: An important feature of two-port circuit analysis 
is the derivation of the parameters of a composite two-port 
circuit that is a combination of individual two-port circuits.
The individual two-port circuits may be combined 
in one of the five types of connection: cascade, parallel, 
series, series–parallel, or parallel–series.
24.4.1  Cascade Connection
When two or more circuits are cascaded, the output of 
any circuit other than the last is applied as the input 
of the following circuit, as illustrated in Figure 24.13 
for two cascaded two-port circuits N′ and N″. A com-
posite circuit is formed whose input variables are V1 
and I1 and whose output variables are V2 and I2. It 
is desired to express the parameters of the composite 
circuit in terms of the parameters of the individual 
circuits.

Two-Port Circuits

A useful special application of Equation 24.34 is in 
deriving the transfer function of ladder circuits of the 
general form shown in Figure 24.16. The idea is to con-
sider each series impedance and each shunt admittance 
as a two-port circuit, derive the a-parameter matrix of 
each element, and then derive the a-parameter matrix 
of the ladder as the product of the matrices of the indi-
vidual elements. The transfer function of the ladder 
network is then the 1/a11 parameter of the composite 
circuit. Example 24.6 illustrates the procedure.
Example 24.6:  Transfer Function of Ladder Circuit
It is required to derive the transfer function of a ladder 
circuit as a cascade of two-port circuits.
Solution:
Consider a series impedance element Z in Figure 24.17a. 
The a parameters follow readily. With port 2 open-­
circuited,
 
a11

When port 2 is short-circuited, V1 =

a-parameter matrix is therefore

24.4.2  Parallel Connection
When two-port circuits are connected in parallel or in 
series at their input or output ports, the two-port cir-
cuit equations no longer apply, in general, to the indi-
vidual circuits. Thus, in the case of the two paralleled 
two-port circuits N′ and N″ in Figure 24.20, the currents 
entering and leaving the input and output ports are 
not, in ­general, equal. That is, ¢ ¹ ¢

2 . This invalidates the two-port circuit equa-
tions, which are based on the assumption of equal-
ity of the currents entering and leaving the input and 
output ports (Figure 24.1). This situation is illustrated 
in Figure  24.21 by two paralleled π-circuits shown 
in thick lines. The circuit can be readily analyzed in 
the conventional manner by noting that correspond-
ing resistances in the two π-circuits are paralleled 
so that the composite circuit reduces to that shown 
in Figure 24.22, where 2‖1 = 2/3 Ω, 2‖3 = 6/5 Ω and 
1‖4 = 4/5 Ω. The current through the 2/3 Ω across the 
10 V source is 15 A, and the current through the three 
series-connected resistors is 10/(2/3 + 6/5 + 4/5) = 
3.75 A. The currents through the individual resistors 
follow from current division, as shown in Figure 24.21. 
It is seen that 12.5 A enter the input port of N′ but 13 
A leave this port, and 0.25 A leave the output port of 
this circuit, but 0.75 A enter this port. Similarly, 6.25 A 
enter the input port of the lower π-circuit, but 5.75 A

leave this port, and 0.25 A enter the output port of this 
circuit, but 0.75 A leave the port.
The port currents for each individual circuit can be 
made equal by connecting a 1:1 ideal transformer at 
either port of either of the two circuits. The ideal trans-
former forces equality between the currents entering 
and leaving the port at which the transformer is con-
nected. The equality of these currents at the other 
port of the same circuit then follows from Kirchhoff’s 
current law (KCL). In Figure 24.23, for example, a 
1:1 ideal transformer is connected at the input port 
of N′. From  KCL, the currents entering and leaving 
the input or output terminals of the transformer are 
equal. With the same current entering and leaving the 
source, it follows from KCL at the source terminals 
that the same current enters and leaves the input port 
of N″. If either N′ or N″ is surrounded by a closed 
surface, it also follows from KCL that the same cur-
rent enters and leaves the output port of N′ or N″. The 
conditions for applying the two-port equations are 
therefore satisfied.
By definition of a parallel connection of two-port cir-
cuits, (1) the input voltage is the same and the output 
voltage is the same, for all the paralleled circuits, and 
(2) the input and output currents of the composite cir-
cuit are the sums of the input and output currents of 
the individual circuits, respectively. The most appropri-
ate two-port equations for describing the composite cir-
cuit are therefore the y-parameter equations, since the 
dependent variables in these equations are the same 
input and output voltages for all the paralleled circuits. 
In the case of the two-port circuits of Figure 24.23, the 
y-parameter equations are

With the 1:1 ideal transformer connected, the com-

1:1 ideal transformer does not change any of the two-
port parameters of the circuit to which it is connected.

Note that in all cases, y12 = y21 because of reciproc-
ity. Once the y parameters of the composite circuit are 
known, terminal voltages and currents of the com-
posite circuit can be derived for any given conditions. 
For example, if 10  V are applied at the input port 
(Figure  24.21), the open-circuit output voltage is V2 = 
V1/a11 = V1(−y21/y22) = 10 × 4/9 = 40/9 V.
The use of the ideal transformer precludes, of course, 
dc conditions. However, the two-port equations remain 
valid in this case if the paralleled two-port circuits 
are three-terminal, each having a common terminal 
between input and output, with the common terminals 
of all the paralleled circuits connected together. This is 
illustrated in Figure 24.24, which shows two π-circuits, 
as in Figure 24.21, but with the bottom resistor of each 
circuit replaced by a short circuit so as to make the cir-
cuits three-terminal. Applying the same procedure used 
in connection with Figure 24.21, it is seen that any arbi-
trarily assumed value of I1¢, including 13 A, satisfies KCL 
at any of the six junctions representing the two common 
terminals that are connected together, that is, I1¢ is inde-
terminate. The reason for this is that the six junctions 
are in reality a single node. The currents between the

With 10 V applied at the input port (Figure 24.24), the 
open-circuit output voltage is V2 = V1/a11 = V1(−y21/y22) = 
10 × 2/5 = 4 V.
Primal Exercise 24.10
Derive the y parameters for the individual two-port 
­circuits of Figures 24.21 and 24.24.
Exercise 24.11
Verify by PSpice simulation that if a transformer is 
connected to any of the ports of Figure 24.21 and 10 V 
ac is applied at the input port, the output voltage is 
40/9 = 4.44 V.
Exercise 24.12
Argue that in order that the two-port circuit equations 
remain valid when n two-port circuits are paralleled, 
a 1:1 ideal transformer should be connected at the input 
or output of (n − 1) of the circuits.
Example 24.7:  Two-Port Circuits

An application of the paralleling of two three-­terminal 
circuits is the notch filter consisting of two paral-
leled T-circuits, as shown in Figure 24.25. These cir-
cuits are also part of the universal filter discussed in 
Section 15.6. It is required to derive the transfer func-
tion of the filter.
Solution:

From Table 14.3, this is the transfer function of a band-

A useful application of paralleling two-port circuits 
is the derivation of the transfer function of a three-­
terminal circuit that is bridged by an admittance 
between the input and output terminals (Figure 24.27). 
The admittance Y is considered a symmetrical two-
port circuit, in the same manner as the series imped-
ance in Figure  24.17a. If V2 = 0, then I1 = −I2 = YV1 
(Figure 24.28). It follows that the y-parameter matrix of 
the admittance Y is

The y-parameter matrix of the composite circuit is

eters of the composite circuit are determined, any of the 
terminal conditions for the circuit can be derived using 
Table 24.3.
Primal Exercise 24.13
Derive the y-parameter matrix of Equation 24.53 from 
the a-parameter matrix of the series element of Figure 
24.17a, using the conversion of a to y parameters of 
Table 24.3.

Assume that in Figure 24.27, circuit ¢
N  has the following

Determine the y parameters of ¢

inductor.
Ans. y11 = 2 + 1/jω S, y12 = −(3 + 1/jω) S, y21 = −(5 + 1/jω) S, 
and y22 = 8 +1/jω S.
24.4.3  Series Connection
In a series connection (Figure 24.31), (1) the input cur-
rent is the same, and the output current is the same, for 
all the series-connected circuits, and (2) the input and 
output voltages of the composite circuit are the sums of 
the input and output voltages of the individual circuits. 
A 1:1 ideal transformer is connected at the input port of 
N′ so as to equalize the currents entering and leaving 
each port, which validates the use of the two port equa-
tions, as explained in connection with Figure 24.23.
The z-parameter equations are the most appropriate 
in this case, since the dependent variables are the input 
and output currents, which are equal for the series-­
connected circuits. The z-parameter equations are

To connect these circuits in series with their common 
terminals connected together, it is convenient to con-
nect the circuit of Figure 24.32b “upside down,” as in 
Figure 24.33. This reverses the polarities of the current 
and voltage at both ports, as shown, which changes nei-
ther the two-port equations nor the z ­parameters. Hence, 
the z parameters of the composite circuit are

Note that according to the values of its z param-
eters, the composite circuit is symmetrical, although 
it is not geometrically symmetrical about a vertical 
midline. Note also that the currents in the ‘wiring rect-
angle’ in the center of Figure 24.33 are indeterminate. 
If this rectangle is enclosed by a closed figure, then 
ISh is the same in the two 1 Ω resistors connected to 
this rectangle. KCL at the upper junction is ¢ + ¢ =
I
I
ISh

Substituting ¢ = ¢¢

, which 
is KCL at the lower junction. Hence, given ISh, the cur-
rents in the wiring rectangle cannot be uniquely deter-
mined, since KCL at the two nodes does not give two 
independent equations. As pointed out earlier, this 
indeterminacy is because the currents in the rectangle 
are fictitious currents in assumed wiring connections 
that are short circuits, as explained in connection with 
Figure 24.24.
Suppose that the output terminals of the compos-
ite ­circuit of Figure 24.33 are short-circuited, and it is 
desired to determine the short circuit current from the 
z parameters when VSRC = 21 V. With V2 = 0, y21 = I2/V1 
(Table 24.2), with y21 = −z21/Δz, where Δz = z11z22 – z12z21. 
Substituting gives I2 = −V1(z21/Δz) = − (21) × 2/(25 − 4) = 
−2 A so that the short-circuit current is 2 A.
This result can be readily checked by conventional 
analysis of the composite circuit. The two subcircuits 
can be combined as in Figure 24.34. The resistance seen 
by the source is 1 + (2‖3) + 2 = 21/5 Ω. The source current 
is 5 A and divides into 2 and 3 A as shown. The short-
circuit current is seen to be 2 A, as obtained earlier.
A useful application of the series connection of two-
port circuits is the derivation of the transfer function of 
a three-terminal circuit having a coupling impedance as 
shown in Figure 24.35. The impedance Z may itself be 
considered a symmetrical three-terminal circuit, as the 
shunt admittance in Figure 24.17b. If I2 = 0, then V1 = 
V2 = ZI1. The z-parameter matrix is

The z-parameter matrix of the composite circuit is 
then the sum of the matrix of Equation 24.42 and the 
z-parameter matrix of the two-port circuit N′. Once the z 
parameters of the composite circuit are determined, any 
of the terminal conditions for the circuit can be derived 
using Table 24.3.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Primal Exercise 24.16
Derive the z-parameter matrix of Equation 24.59 from the 
a-parameter matrix of the shunt element of Figure 24.17b, 
using the conversion of a to z parameters of Table 24.3.
Example 24.9:  Series Connection of Two-Port Circuits
It is required to derive the z parameters of the circuit of 
Figure 24.36 using Equation 24.58.
Solution:
For the linear transformer having the dot ­markings 
shown, the two-port equations are, from KVL 
(Figure 24.37),

24.4.4  Series–Parallel Connection
In a series–parallel connection, the input ports are con-
nected in series and the output ports are connected 
in parallel, as illustrated in Figure 24.38, where a 1:1 
ideal transformer is connected at the input port of one 
circuit to ensure equality of the current entering or 
leaving any of the ports, as explained previously. The 
h-parameter equations are the most appropriate in this 
case, since the dependent variables are the input cur-
rent and the output voltage, which are equal for the 
series–parallel–connected circuits. The h-parameter 
equations are

their common terminals joined together. This is shown 
in Figure 24.39, where the circuit of Figure 24.32b is 
drawn “upside down,” as in Figure 24.33. As noted in

KCL at the lower junction. Hence, KCL at the two

As in the preceding cases, the currents in the wir-
ing rectangle are not independent and for the same 
reasons.
Suppose that it is desired to determine the open-­circuit 
voltage of the composite circuit from the h parameters, 
with VSRC = 21 V. If I2 = 0, V2 = V1/a11 (Table 24.2), or 
V2 = V1(−h21/Δh), where Δh = h11h22 − h12h21 =  7/2. 
Substituting, gives V2 = 21/−21= −1 V.
This result can be checked by conventional analysis 
of the composite circuit. Figure 24.39 can be redrawn 
as a bridge circuit (Figure 24.40). Rac = 3‖2 = 1.2 Ω, Vac = 
21(1.2/(3 + 1.2)) = 6 V; V2 = 6(1/3 − 1/2) = −1 V, as 
obtained earlier.

one circuit to ensure equality of the current entering 
or leaving any of the ports, as explained previously. 
The g-parameter equations are the most appropri-
ate in this case, since the dependent variables are the 
input voltage and the output current, which are equal

ceding cases, the currents in the wiring rectangle are not

Suppose that it is desired to determine the short-­circuit 
current of the composite circuit from the g parameters, 
with VSRC = 25 V. If V2 = 0, I2 = V1y21 (Table 24.2), or I2 = 
V1(−g21/g22). Substituting gives I2 = 25(−25) = −1 A so 
that the short-circuit current is 1 A.
This result can be checked by conventional analysis 
of the composite circuit. Figure 24.42 can be redrawn 
as a bridge circuit (Figure 24.43). I2 is determined using 
Thevenin’s equivalent circuit (TEC). On open-circuit,

It follows that I2 = (−25/6)/(25/6) = −1 A, so that the 
short-circuit current is 1 A as obtained previously.
Primal Exercise 24.18
Derive the g parameters of the two-port circuits of 
Figures 24.43 and 24.44.
24.5  Analysis of Terminated Two-Port 
Circuits
A terminated two-port circuit has a source of impedance 
Zsrc connected to one port, say port 1, and an imped-
ance ZL connected to the other port, as illustrated in 
Figure  24.44. It is required to analyze this circuit and 
derive the following expressions that are generally of 
interest in describing amplifier circuits:
	
1.	The input impedance Zin = V1/I1, with ZL con-
nected to port 2
	
2.	The current gain I2/I1
	
3.	TEC looking into port 2, where ZTh is the output 
impedance looking into this port
	
4.	The ratio I2/Vsrc
	
5.	The voltage gain V2/V1
	
6.	The voltage gain V2/Vsrc
It is straightforward enough to replace the circuit ‘N’ 
in Figure 24.44 by the equivalent z-parameter circuit 
of Figure 24.11a and to derive the expressions men-
tioned earlier from conventional mesh-current analy-
sis (Exercise 24.19). What we will do instead in this 
section is to derive these expressions using two-port 
relations.
One approach is to consider ‘N’ and ZL as two cas-
caded two-port circuits constituting a composite two-
port circuit 
¢
N  (Figure 24.45). ‘N’ and 
¢
N  have the same 
V1, I1, and V2 but different port 2 currents. When ¢ =
I2
0, 
the same conditions prevail at port 2 of 
¢
N  as at the out-
put in Figure 24.44.
The a-parameter matrix of ZL is, from Equation 24.36,

Alternatively, since V2 = −ZLI2, Equation 24.77 follows 
directly from Equation 24.76.
To express items 1–6 earlier in terms of parameters 
other than a parameters, we substitute in the expres-
sions derived earlier for the a parameters in terms of 
any other set of parameters. The resulting expressions 
are listed in Table 24.6.
Exercise 24.19
Derive the expressions for items 1–6 listed at the 
beginning of the section directly in terms of the z 
parameters by using the equivalent circuit of Figure 
24.11a for N in Figure 24.44 and solving the two 
mesh-current equations. Verify your results against 
Table 24.6.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 A two-port circuit may be specified in terms of 
one of six sets of two simultaneous equations, each 
of which involves four parameters. In general, 
these parameters are nonzero and independent.
•	 The matrices of the z and y parameters are 
inversely related, as are the matrices of the a 
and b parameters and the matrices of the h and 
g parameters.
•	 The parameters of the two-port circuit equa-
tions can be interpreted in terms of voltage 
and current ratios under specified open-circuit 
and short-circuit terminations, and any one set 
of parameters can be expressed in terms of the 
other sets of parameters.
•	 In a reciprocal two-port circuit, z12 = z21 and 
y12  = y21, with corresponding relations for the 
other sets of parameters.
	
1.	 A reciprocal circuit is specified in general by 
three independent, nonzero parameters.
	
2.	 A circuit that does not have dependent 
sources is reciprocal. But a circuit can have 
dependent sources and still be reciprocal.
•	 A reciprocal circuit is symmetric if terminal 
voltages and currents remain the same when 
the two ports are interchanged.
	
1.	 In a symmetric circuit and in addition to the 
reciprocity relations, z12 = z22 and y11 = y22, 
with corresponding relations for the other 
sets of parameters.
	
2.	 A symmetric circuit is specified in general 
by two independent, nonzero parameters.
•	 The z-parameter, y-parameter, h-parameter, and 
g-parameter equations may be represented in 
terms of equivalent circuits in which forward and 
reverse transmissions are described by depen-
dent sources on the output and input sides.
•	 Two-port circuits may be connected in cascade, 
in parallel, in series, in series–parallel, and in 
parallel–series. The matrix of parameters of the 
two-port composite circuit is a simple combina-
tion of the matrices of parameters of the indi-
vidual circuits.
•	 Except in the cascade connection, the two-port 
circuit equations are no longer valid, in general, 
in the case of the four other composite connec-
tions, because of inequality of currents entering 
and leaving input or output ports. Equality of 
these currents can be forced by connecting a 1:1 
ideal transformer at the input or output port of 
either of the two circuits.
•	 The two-port circuits remain valid in the case 
of the connections other than the cascade, if the 
two-port circuits are three-terminal, with their 
common terminals ­connected together.
•	 A two-port circuit that is terminated by source 
and load impedances can be analyzed by con-
sidering the two-port circuit proper to be cas-
caded with the load impedance, when looking 
into port 1, and to be cascaded with the source 
impedance when looking into port 2.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	The open-circuit transfer function is readily 
determined by deriving a11.
	
2.	Matrix multiplication is greatly facilitated using 
MATLAB.

Objective and Overview
Modern electric power systems are gigantic networks 
that connect numerous power stations to a multitude 
of load centers dispersed over a wide geographical area 
that may span several neighboring countries. These 
networks incorporate sophisticated communications 
and control systems that are used to optimize the per-
formance of the network. Three-phase systems are 
almost universally used for the generation, transmis-
sion, and distribution of electrical energy because of the 
many advantages they offer compared to single-phase 
­systems. Practical three-phase systems are nominally 
balanced under normal operating conditions, that is, 
their voltages and currents possess a certain symmetry.
The chapter presents the fundamentals of balanced 
three-phase systems, starting with the two basic con-
nections of these systems, namely, Y and Δ, and their 
characteristic features. This is followed by explaining 
the basic approach in analyzing balanced three-phase 
­systems by transforming the Δ connection to Y and 
deriving an equivalent single-phase system. Because 
three-phase systems are primarily power systems, 
power ­relations in these systems are then discussed, 
including ­instantaneous and complex power, power 
measurement, and power ­factor correction. The chapter 
ends with ­highlighting the  advantages of three-phase 
systems and considering the overall structure of power 
systems.
25.1  Three-Phase Variables
Consider the set ya, yb, and yc representing either voltages 
or currents that vary sinusoidally with time as follows:
	
y

(25.3)
ya, yb, and yc are described as balanced three-phase vari-
ables, because of two distinguishing characteristics: they 
all have the same amplitude Ym, and their phase angles 
differ by 120°, or 1/3 of the full angle of 360°. By extension, 
the set ya, yb, …, yn represents balanced n-phase variables 
if all these variables have the same amplitude and their 
phase angles differ by 360°/n. If either condition is not 
satisfied, the variables are no longer balanced. Systems 
having n > 2 are described as polyphase systems.
Three-phase systems are by far the most important 
polyphase systems in practice. The basic three-phase 
system consists of a three-phase generator, represented 
by three sources, each having a source impedance, con-
nected to a three-phase load. The generator and load 
may be connected in Y or Δ, which gives rise to four 
possibilities, illustrated in Figure 25.1a to d. The source 
voltages are three phase, in accordance with Equations 
25.1 to 25.3, and the impedances of the three sources are 
assumed to be equal.
The common node of the Y connection is the neutral. 
Each connection between the generator and the load 
(aA, bB, or cC) in Figure 25.1a to d is a line. In power 
systems, the lines are often referred to as feeders. A line 
has a certain impedance, which in particular cases may 
be neglected. The line impedances are denoted by ZaA, 
ZbB, and ZcC in Figure 25.1a to d. The current that flows 
in a given line is a line current. The voltage between any 
two lines, whether at the generator end or the load end, 
is a line voltage.
The generator or load branches that are connected in 
Y or Δ are the phases. In Figure 25.1a to d, each phase of 
the generator consists of an ideal voltage source in series 
with a source impedance. In the simplest cases, the 
source impedances can be neglected. The phases of the 
load are the impedances ZA, ZB, and ZC. These may be 
single-phase loads such as lamps or heaters, connected 
in Y or Δ, or they may be an inherently three-phase load, 
such as a three-phase motor. A phase voltage and a 
phase current are associated with each phase.
A three-phase system is balanced if all of the following 
conditions are satisfied:

dance with Equations 25.1 to 25.3:

Under these conditions, each of the sets of phase volt-
ages, phase currents, line voltages, and line currents is a 
balanced set.
The three-phase systems illustrated in Figure 25.1a 
to d are three-wire systems because three lines con-
nect the generator to the load. With both the generator 
and load connected in Y, the two neutral points may 
be connected together, resulting in a four-wire system 
(Figure 25.2).
25.1.1  Sum of Balanced Variables
An important characteristic of balanced voltages or 
­currents is the following:
Concept: The sum of a set of balanced voltages or currents 
is zero.
Although this is true of any number of phases, we will 
illustrate it for the three-phase case. Thus, if ya, yb, and yc 
are a balanced set given by Equations 25.1 to 25.3, their 
sum is zero:

Alternatively, we may add any two phasors and show 
that the sum is the negative of the third phasor. For 
example, if we add Yb and Yc in Figure 25.3c using the 
parallelogram construction, the resultant is −Ya.
In the time domain, adding yb and yc in Equations 25.2 
and 25.3 gives Ymcos(ωt + θ – 120°) + Ymcos(ωt + θ + 
120°) = 2Ymcos(ωt + θ) × cos120° = −Ymcos(ωt + θ) = −ya. 
Figure 25.4 illustrates the time variation of ya, yb, and 
yc. At any instant of time, such as t1 or t2, the sum of ya, 
yb, and yc is zero. At t2, for example, if ya represents cur-
rent flowing toward a load, then the total current flow-
ing away from the load, (yb + yc), is equal and opposite. 
A useful way of looking at this is to consider that at any 
instant, such as t2, two line conductors are acting as the 
return line of the third conductor or, alternatively, one 
conductor is acting as the return line for the other two.
25.1.2  Phase Sequence
In Equations 25.1 through 25.3, yb lags ya by 120° and 
yc lags yb by 120°, since cos(ωt + θ + 120°) = cos(ωt + θ – 
240°), or yc leads ya by 120°. The phase sequence is ‘abc’ 
and is a positive phase sequence. If the phase angles of 
yb and yc are interchanged,

(25.12)
then yc lags ya by 120° and yb leads ya by 120°. The phase 
sequence is now ‘acb’ and is a negative phase sequence.
The phasors in Figure 25.3a have a positive phase 
sequence. If we move around the origin in the clockwise 
direction, the order in which the phasors are encoun-
tered is the phase sequence, which is ‘abc’ for a positive 
sequence.
In a negative phase sequence, phasors Yb and Yc are 
interchanged, but the same interpretations apply. The 
phase sequence is now the order in which the phases are 
encountered in going clockwise around the origin, so 
that the phase sequence is ‘acbacb’, or ‘cba’, the reverse 
of ‘abc’.
In practice, the phase sequence is reversed by inter-
changing any two line connections to a three-phase 
load. Assuming a positive phase sequence ‘abc’ in 
Figure 25.5a, the load, whose terminals are ‘A’, ‘B’, and 
‘C’, sees the same phase sequence ‘abc’. In Figure 25.5b, 
the same load connected to the same supply sees a

negative phase sequence ‘acb’. If the load is a lighting 
or heating load, changing the phase sequence is gener-
ally of no consequence. However, if the load incorpo-
rates a three-phase motor, reversing the phase sequence 
reverses the direction of rotation of the motor. Although 
this provides a convenient way for reversing the direc-
tion of rotation of an ac motor, it may have disastrous 
mechanical consequences on loads already connected 
to the motor, such as compressors or machine tools. 
Moreover, it is common practice in medium and large 
three-phase power systems to have two or more three-
phase generators connected in parallel, in which case 
they must have the same phase sequence.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, a positive phase 
sequence is assumed in the rest of the chapter.

Summary: In a balanced Y connection, the line voltages are 
balanced three-phase voltages whose magnitude is 3 times 
that of the phase voltage and whose phase angle leads by 30° 
the phase voltage designated by the first subscript of the line 
voltage, where the assigned positive polarity of the line voltage 
is a voltage drop from the node designated by the first sub-
script to the node designated by the second subscript.
Thus, Vab, for example, is 3Vg and leads the phase 
­voltage VA, or Vga, by 30°.
25.2.2  Current Relations
It follows from KCL in Figure 25.7 that the phase cur-
rents are the same as the line currents. Moreover, each 
of the phase currents is equal to the corresponding 
phase voltage of the generator or the load divided by

It follows from Equations 25.16 to 25.18 that the line 
currents IaA, IbB, and IcC form a balanced three-phase set, 
which means that their sum is zero:
	
I

(25.19)
However, if the generator is enclosed by a surface S, 
it follows from KCL, as discussed in connection with 
Figure 2.19, that IaA + IbB + IcC + InN = 0. Substituting in 
Equation 25.19 gives InN = 0. In other words, the current 
in the neutral conductor is zero, so that this conductor 
can be removed without affecting the voltages or cur-
rents in the rest of the system. Moreover, if the neutral 
node ‘n’ on the generator side is grounded, neutral node 
‘N’ on the load side will also be at zero voltage.
Summary: In a balanced Y–Y connection, the line currents are 
balanced three-phase currents that are equal to the phase cur-
rents. The neutral conductor does not carry any current. It may 
be removed, leaving the two neutral nodes at the same voltage.
In practice, the neutral conductor carries some current 
due to any imbalance in the load, or due to a third-
harmonic current  (see Problem P25.14).

Example 25.1:  Phase Voltages and 
Currents in a Y-Connected Generator
A balanced three-phase load absorbs 72 kW at 0.8 p.f. lag-
ging and is connected to a balanced, Y-connected, three-
phase generator, the rms value of the line current being 
100 A, the line impedances being negligible. Determine 
the phase voltages and phase currents of the generator.

The phase currents of the generator are the same as the

To determine the phase angles, we note that the gener-
ator must deliver the same power as that absorbed by 
the load, that is, 72 kW at 0.8 p.f., or 24 kW per phase at 
0.8 p.f. Consider phase ‘a’ of the generator; the power 
relation is 24,000 = 300 × 100 × cos θ, so cos θ = 0.8, or 
θ = 36.9°. It follows, since the power factor is lagging, that

Alternatively, we may assume that the load is Y con-
nected, in which case the load phase voltages are the 
same as the generator phase voltages, the load phase 
currents are equal to the generator phase currents 
(­Figure 25.7), and the load phase currents lag the cor-
responding phase voltages by θ. The relations derived 
earlier for the generator phase currents then follow.
Problem-Solving Tips
•	 When determining voltages or currents in a 
­balanced, three-phase system, it is only necessary 
to evaluate the voltage or current for one phase 
or line. The remaining three-phase voltages and 
currents then follow from the fact that balanced 
three-phase voltages and currents have the same 
magnitude but with 120° phase difference between 
successive phases.
•	 In a Y connection, if the line voltages are known 
the phase voltages readily follow, since the phase 
voltage designated by the first subscript of the line 
voltage lags the line voltage by 30° and has 1
3
/
 of 
its magnitude.

Summary: In a balanced Δ connection, the line voltages are 
equal to the phase voltages. The line currents are balanced 
three-phase currents that have 3 times the magnitude of the 
phase currents. The line current lags by 30° the phase cur-
rent designated by either subscript of the line current, where 
the assigned positive direction of line current is from the node 
denoted by the first subscript toward the node designated by 
the second subscript.

Example 25.2:  Phase Currents in a Δ-Connected Load

According to Equations 25.25, the line currents lag the 
corresponding phase currents by 30°, or the phase cur-

25.4  Analysis of Balanced 
Three-Phase Systems
Three-phase systems, balanced or unbalanced, may be 
analyzed using the general methods discussed in pre-
vious chapters. The mesh-current method is advan-
tageous since a three-wire Y–Y system has only two 
meshes, a Δ–Δ system four meshes. However, it is gen-
erally ­simpler to analyze balanced, three-phase systems 
by reducing them to a single-phase equivalent circuit 
based on a Y–Y representation.
25.4.1  Y–Y System
A balanced Y–Y system is shown in Figure 25.11a. 
Since  nodes ‘n’ and ‘N’ are at the same voltage,

Equation 25.30 also applies to the circuit shown in 
Figure 25.11b, which is the single-phase equivalent cir-
cuit for phase ‘a’. Once IaA is determined from Equation 
25.30, the phase voltages Van and VAN are readily 
obtained as

Since all phase variables in a balanced three-phase 
system are balanced sets, then once IaA, Van, and VAN are 
determined, the corresponding variables for the other 
two phases immediately follow; they have the same 
magnitude but are phase shifted by 120°. The line volt-
ages are obtained as discussed in Section 25.2.
Example 25.3:  Analysis of Balanced Y–Y System

reactance of −j10 Ω.
Solution:
The single-phase equivalent circuit is shown in 
Figure 25.12. The load impedance ZY is the parallel com-

connected, balanced, three-phase systems.
25.4.2  Δ–Δ System
When the generator, load, or both are Δ connected, the 
procedure is to transform the system to a Y–Y system, 
which is analyzed as discussed previously. Any desired 
phase current of the Δ-connected load can then be 
derived.
A balanced Δ–Δ system is shown in Figure 25.13a. 
The Δ-connected load may be readily transformed to 
an equivalent Y simply by substituting Z
Z
Y =
D/3. To 
t­ransform the Δ-connected generator to its equivalent Y, 
we have to derive its TEC, which can be done from equiv-
alence between every two of the three terminals ‘abc’ 
under two sets of conditions: (1) the same open-circuit 
line voltages (Figure 25.13b) and (2) the same equiva-
lent impedance with the ideal voltage sources set to 
zero (Figure 25.13c). The latter condition is the usual Y 
equivalent of Δ-connected impedances, which is a set 
of impedances Z

Y =
/3. To satisfy the first condition, 
we have to determine IΔ, the current that circulates in the 
Δ under open-circuit conditions. From Figure 25.13b,

The numerator is the sum of balanced three-phase 
voltages, which is zero. Hence, IΔ = 0. It follows that the 
line voltages under open-circuit conditions are equal to 
the phase voltages:

The equivalent Y connection will then have in each 
phase the corresponding voltage source in series with 
ZgY, as illustrated in Figure 25.14. Clearly, this Y connec-
tion satisfies the required conditions: under open cir-
cuit, the line voltages Vab, Vbc, and Vca are the same as in 
Figure 25.13b; if the sources are set to zero in both cases, 
the resulting Y and Δ are equivalent, since Z

In each phase, the instantaneous power has a steady 
component and an alternating component, just as in 
the single-phase case. The difference, however, is that 
the alternating components in the three phases form a

Vlrms is the rms of the line voltage
The total instantaneous power is thus equal to the 
expression for the real power derived earlier for the Y 
and Δ connections.
Concept: The total instantaneous power delivered to the 
­balanced three-phase load is steady with respect to time; it is 
not pulsating as in the single-phase case.
It is important to be clear about power relations in a 
three-phase system. Referring to Figure 25.21, the power 
relations per phase are exactly those for the single-phase 
case ­considered in Section 17.1. Thus, Equation 17.14, with 
θv = 0 and θi = −θ, gives for the real power in terms of rms 
values per phase: VϕrmsIϕrmscosθ [1 + cos2(ωt − θ)]. Equation 
17.17 gives for the reactive power −VϕrmsIϕrmssinθ sin2(ωt − θ). 
Both the real power per phase and the reactive power per 
phase have time-varying alternating components. Adding 
these two components gives the instantaneous power per 
phase pA (Equation 25.35), also having an alternating com-
ponent that is present in phase ‘A’ and in the correspond-
ing line. However, the alternating components of the three 
phases form a balanced set and cancel out for the three-
phase load as a whole, leaving a steady component equal to 
the real power.
An important practical consequence of the steadiness 
of instantaneous power is that, because the electrical 
power input to a three-phase motor is steady, the output 
torque is ideally steady at constant speed. In contrast, 
the output torque of a single-phase motor inherently has 
a pulsating component that produces vibrations.
25.5.2  Complex Power
By analogy with the single-phase case, the alternating 
components of Equations 25.35 to 25.37 may be inter-
preted in terms of complex power in each phase. A power 
triangle may be constructed, as in the single-phase case, 
where the apparent power per phase |Sϕ|  =  VϕIϕ is 
the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides are the 
real power per phase, Pϕ  =  VϕIϕcosθ, and the reactive 
power per phase, Qϕ = VϕIϕsinθ (Figure 25.22). The load 
impedance angle θ is the angle between the hypotenuse 
and the side representing Pϕ. Each of the total real, reac-
tive, and complex power supplied to the load is three 
times the corresponding quantity in each phase and is 
the same as that derived in Section 25.3.
As in the single-phase case, complex power can be 
very useful in solving three-phase problems, because of 
its conservation and the addition of real, reactive, and 
complex power branch by branch. This is illustrated by 
Example 25.6, which also demonstrates power factor 
correction in a three-phase system.
Example 25.6:  Power Factor Correction 
Using Complex Power
A balanced three-phase system is shown in Figure 25.23a, 
where the load absorbs 50  kW at 0.8 p.f. lagging. A 
capacitor bank of three capacitors C is connected across 
the load terminals so that the p.f. at terminals ‘abc’ is 
unity. Given that the magnitude of the line current, with 
the capacitors connected, is 100 A rms, it is required to 
determine C assuming the frequency to be 50 Hz.
Solution:
From the complex power triangle for the load (Figure 
25.23b), the reactive power of the load is QL = 50 × 
0.6/0.8 = 37.5 kVAR. The total reactive power in the line 
impedances is Ql = 3 × (100)2 × 0.1 = 3 kVAR. If the reac-
tive power of the capacitors is QC, then 37.5 + 3 + QC = 0, 
since the total reactive power at terminals ‘abc’ is zero. 
This gives QC = −40.5 kVAR.
In order to calculate C, we have to determine the 
line voltages at terminals ‘ABC’. This can be done 
from the complex power. The total reactive power 
at ABC is QLC = 37.5 − 40.5 = −3 kVAR. Since the total

The reactive power per phase of the capacitor

(VLC)2 × ωC, where ω = 2π × 50 = 100π rad/s. It follows 
that C = 0.514 × 10−3 ≡ 514 μF.
25.5.3 Two-Wattmeter Method of Power Measurement
In principle, the power in a three-phase system can be 
measured by using three wattmeters to measure the 
real power in each phase and adding the three readings. 
However, in a three-wire system only two wattmeters 
need to be used. This is because, as mentioned in connec-
tion with Figure 25.4, one of the lines may be considered 
as the return path for the currents in the two other lines. If, 
for the sake of argument, we consider lines ‘aA’ and ‘cC’ to 
be ‘input’ lines and line ‘bB’ to be the common return line, 
the two wattmeters may be connected as shown in Figure 
25.24. The current coils are connected in accordance with 
the assigned positive directions of iaA and icC, whereas the 
voltage coils are connected in accordance with the polari-
ties of the line voltages vAB and vCB. The wattmeters are 
assumed ideal, so that the voltage drop across each cur-
rent coil is zero and the current through each voltage coil 
is zero. The sum of the readings of the two wattmeters 
gives the total real power consumed by the load, irrespec-
tive of whether the load is balanced or unbalanced.
If the load is balanced, the readings of the two wattme-
ters can be readily related to the line voltages, the line 
currents, and the phase angle of the load. Assume, for 
the sake of argument, that the load is Y connected. The 
phasor diagram of Figure 25.8a relates the phase and 
line voltages. This is reproduced in Figure 25.25, with 
only the currents IaA and IcC and the voltages VAB and 
VCB indicated. The currents are shown lagging the cor-
responding phase voltages by θ.
The reading of each wattmeter equals the product of 
the rms magnitude of the current through the current 
coil, the rms magnitude of the voltage across the voltage 
coil, and the cosine of the phase angle between the cur-
rent and the voltage. From the phasor diagram of Figure 
25.25, the phase angle between VAB and IaA is 30° + θ, 
whereas the phase angle between VCB and IcC is 30° − θ . 
The readings of the two wattmeters are therefore

Example 25.7:  Two-Wattmeter Method 
of Measuring Power
In a balanced three-phase system, a load absorbs 30 kW 
at p.f. 0.75 lagging. If two wattmeters are connected to 
measure the real power in the load, as in Figure 25.24, 
determine the reading of each wattmeter.
Solution:
cos θ = 0.75, so θ = 41.4°, and cos(30° + θ) = 0.32. The 
real power consumed by the load is 30  kW; hence,

25.6  Advantages of Three-Phase Systems

power transmission. Two main “figures of merit” may

Balanced Three-Phase Systems

single-phase system that transmits the same power: the 
mass of line conductor used and the I 2R loss in these con-
ductors. The mass of conductor represents an installation 
cost of the system; the lighter the line conductors, whether 
in the form of underground cables or overhead transmis-
sion lines, the lower is their cost, and, in the case of over-
head transmission lines, the lighter and less expensive are 
the transmission towers required. The I 2R loss represents 
wasted power and is an operating cost of the system.
Consider a single-phase system supplying three loads 
ZS (Figure 25.28a) and a three-phase system supply-
ing three loads ZY connected in Y (Figure 25.28b). It is 
assumed that (1) the magnitude of the load voltage is 
VL in both cases, which means that the magnitude of 
the line voltage in the Y connection is 3VL; (2) ZS = 3ZY, 
which implies that ZS and ZY have the same phase angle 
and  |ZS|  =  3|ZY| (because V

/3, this 
means that the magnitude of the line current is the same 
in both cases); and (3) the line conductors in both sys-
tems are of the same length, type, and material, which 
in practice is either copper or aluminum. Because Il is 
the same, this implies that the line conductors have the 
same current-carrying capacity and hence the same 
cross-sectional area, resistance, mass, and I 2R loss.

The Y connection transmits twice as much power per line 
conductor, or per unit mass of line conductor, as the 
­single-phase connection. The reason for this is easy to see 
from Figure 25.28. A separate return conductor is required 
in a single-phase system but not in a balanced three-phase 
­system, since in the latter case, each line conductor also 
acts as the return for the other two conductors. If each 
line conductor in the Y connection had its own return 
conductor, the power transmitted per line conductor 
will be 3

, which is the same as in single phase.
Since each line conductor in Figure 25.28 has the 
same I 2R loss, the power transmitted per kilowatt of I 2R 
loss varies between the two cases in the same manner 
as the power transmitted per line conductor. In other 
words, the three-phase system transmits twice as much 
power per kilowatt of I2R loss as the single-phase sys-
tem. Moreover, the total line voltage drop in the single-
phase case has a magnitude of 2|Zl|Il, where |Zl| is 
the magnitude of the line impedance. In the three-phase 
case, the line-to-line voltage drop is the line impedance 
multiplied by the phasor difference of any two line cur-
rents. The magnitude of this difference is 3Il, so that 
the magnitude of the line-to-line voltage drop in the 
three-phase case is 
3 Z I
l
l, which is less than that in 
the single-phase case. The three-phase system of Figure 
25.28b is therefore more advantageous than the single-
phase system of Figure 25.28a for transmitting power in 
all of the respects considered.
Other advantages of three-phase systems may be 
listed:
	
1.	As mentioned earlier, the total instantaneous 
power is steady with respect to time, which 
means that the output torque of a three-
phase motor is steady and does not produce 
vibrations.
	
2.	It can be shown that the magnetic field in a 
three-phase motor is rotating, so that a three-
phase motor is inherently self-starting. On the 
other hand, the magnetic field in a single phase 
is pulsating rather than rotating, so that some 
additional means have to be provided for start-
ing the motor.
	
3.	Three-phase transformers, motors, and genera-
tors have smaller frame sizes than their single-
phase counterpart of the same power rating 
because of the elimination of a separate return 
path for the magnetic flux.
Figure 25.29 illustrates a section through a three-
phase transformer. The core has three limbs, one for 
each of the three-phase fluxes Φa, Φb, and Φc. Two sets 
of windings are shown around each limb, a primary 
winding, such as ‘ap’, and a secondary winding, such 
as ‘as’; similarly for phases ‘b’ and ‘c’. Since the phase 
voltages form a balanced set, the three fluxes Φa, Φb, and 
Φc also form a balanced set. This means that their sum 
at any instant is zero, so no separate return path is needed 
for each of these fluxes. This is in contrast to three separate 
single-phase transformers that are connected in a three-
phase system. In each transformer a return path must 
be provided for each flux. Consequently the three-phase 
transformer will have a smaller core than three separate 
single-phase transformers of the same voltage and total 
power rating.

Circuit Analysis with PSpice: A Simplified Approach
25.7  Power Generation, Transmission, 
and Distribution
A power system may be divided into the following func-
tional parts:
	
1.	Power generation: Electric power is generated 
in power stations from hydroelectric power, 
or from burning fossil fuels, such as oil, natu-
ral gas, or coal, or from atomic energy. Electric 
power is being increasingly generated from 
solar energy and from wind power.
	
2.	Power transmission: Since power stations are 
usually located a considerable distance from the 
load centers they serve, and in order to inter-
connect distant parts of the system, or different 
power systems, electric power is transmitted 
over long distances by means of overhead, 
high-voltage transmission lines.
	
3.	Medium-voltage distribution: The high voltages 
are then stepped down to one or more medium 
voltages for distribution in the vicinity of load 
centers and within them.
	
4.	Low-voltage distribution: The lowest medium 
­voltage is eventually stepped down to a low 
voltage for utilization by commercial and 
domestic users.
In power generation, it is advantageous to have the 
highest practicable generator voltage, since this reduces 
the current for a given power rating, and hence the 
cross-sectional area of the conductors in the genera-
tor windings. However, too high a generator voltage 
requires heavy, and costly, insulation. As a compromise, 
three-phase voltages are usually generated at few tens 
of kilovolts. Power is generated at 50  Hz throughout 
most of the world but at 60 Hz in the United States.
For transmitting power over long distances, it is also 
advantageous to use the highest practicable voltages, 
because this reduces the current for a given transmitted 
power and hence the I 2R loss. Transmission voltages may 
be hundreds of thousands of volts or even a million volts. 
It is interesting to note that dc has some distinct advan-
tages over ac for long-distance, high-voltage transmission 
(see Problem P25.61).
Medium-power distribution is normally at few tens 
of kilovolts or less, using underground cables, rather 
than the lower-cost overhead lines, in built-up areas. 
Low-voltage distribution is at standard voltages that 
differ between countries. In most countries, the low-
voltage distribution transformer is a three-phase trans-
former having a Y-connected secondary, the phase 
voltage being 220–240  V rms, the line voltage being 
380–415 V rms. The neutral point is grounded, and a 
ground wire connected to the neutral point is provided 
to consumers in some countries (Figure 25.30), in addi-
tion to the neutral line. Single-phase consumer loads 
are connected between line and neutral, and a three-
phase supply is provided for ­relatively large loads.
In the United States, the low-voltage distribution 
transformer is usually a single-phase transformer that 
steps down the line voltage to a three-wire single-phase 
system  (Figure 25.31). The midpoint of the secondary

winding is a grounded neutral point to which a ­neutral 
line is connected. The outer lines are at voltages of 
110–120  V rms with respect to the neutral, and their 
phases are such that the voltage between lines is twice 
the line-to-neutral voltage, that is, 220–240  V. Higher 
voltage is used to supply relatively large loads, such 
as  heaters and air-conditioning units, whereas small 
loads, such  as  lamps, are connected between one line 
and neutral.
Learning Checklist: What Should 
Be Learned from This Chapter
•	 The sum of a set of balanced variables is zero.
•	 In a balanced Y–Y connection, the neutral 
­current is zero.
•	 In a balanced Y connection, the line currents 
are equal to the phase currents. The line volt-
ages are balanced three-phase voltages that 
have 
3 times the magnitude of the phase 
voltages and are of the same phase sequence. 
For a positive phase sequence, the line voltage 
leads by 30° the phase voltage designated by 
the first transcript of the line voltage, whereas 
for a negative phase sequence, the phase angle 
is 30° lag.
•	 In a balanced Δ connection, the line voltages are 
equal to the phase voltages. The line currents 
are balanced three-phase currents that have 3 
times the magnitude of the phase currents and 
are of the same phase sequence. For a positive 
phase sequence, the line current lags by 30° the 
phase current designated by the subscripts of 
the line current. For a negative phase sequence, 
the phase angle is 30° lead.

two wattmeters.
Problem-Solving Tips
	
1.	When determining voltages or currents in a bal-
anced, three-phase system, it is only necessary 
to evaluate the voltage or current for one phase 
or line. The remaining three-phase voltages and 
currents then follow from the fact that balanced 
three-phase voltages and currents have the 
same magnitude but with 120° phase difference 
between successive phases.
	
2.	In a Y connection, if the line voltages are known, 
the phase voltages readily follow, since the 
phase voltage designated by the first subscript 
of the line voltage lags the line voltage by 30° 
and has 1
3
/
 of its magnitude.
	
3.	In a Δ connection, if the line currents are known, 
the phase currents readily follow, since the 
phase current designated by the first subscript 
of the line current leads the line current by 30° 
and has 1
3
/
 of its magnitude.
	
4.	The single-phase equivalent circuit provides a 
convenient means of analyzing balanced, three-
phase systems, whether the generators and 
loads are Y or Δ connected.
	
5.	When determining the readings of wattmeters 
connected to three-phase systems, phasor dia-
grams of voltages and currents are very helpful.

Probing Further
P25.58	 Consider Figure P25.58, which shows a three-phase 
transformer in which the primary and secondary 
windings are Y connected. The neutral point of the 
secondary is grounded, as is commonly done in three-
phase systems in order to define voltages in power 
systems with respect to the ground reference and to 
provide a path for current flow under fault condi-
tions so as to operate protective devices. If the phase 
voltages are sinusoidal, the magnetic flux in the trans-
former core will be sinusoidal, but the magnetizing 
current in each phase of the primary will have a third 
harmonic component, as explained in Problem P25.14. 
However, since there is no connection to the neutral of 
the primary side, third harmonic currents, which are 
in phase, cannot flow. The phase currents must there-
fore be sinusoidal, which means that the phase volt-
ages are not sinusoidal but contain a third harmonic 
component. The line-to-line voltage is the difference 
of two phase voltages, so that the third harmonics of 
the phase voltages cancel out, and the line voltages are

sinusoidal. With the line voltages sinusoidal and the 
three-phase voltages containing third harmonics that 
are in phase, argue that the primary neutral point, np, 
will oscillate at the third harmonic frequency. Such 
oscillations are undesirable. They could be avoided by 
grounding np, but third harmonic currents will flow 
through ground causing undesirable interference. The 
solution is to connect the primary or secondary wind-
ings in Δ, which allows the third harmonic currents 
to flow in the Δ-connected windings. The magnitude 
of this current is limited by the fact that the reactance 
of the transformer windings is multiplied by three at 
the third harmonic frequency. Hence, transformers in 
power systems invariably have either primary or sec-
ondary windings connected in Δ.
P25.59	 Given that the primary or secondary windings of 
power transformers are connected in Δ, for reasons 
explained in the preceding problem, the other wind-
ing being connected in Y, argue that it is more advan-
tageous to connect the primary windings in Δ when 
line voltages are to be stepped up, whereas it is more 
advantageous to connect the secondary windings in Δ 
when line voltages are to be stepped down.
P25.60	 Y–Δ starting of induction motors: A popular type of ac 
motor is the three-phase, squirrel cage induction motor. 
A characteristic of this type of motor is that at starting, 
the motor appears like a transformer having a short-
circuited secondary, which results in a starting current 
of low power factor and magnitude that is five to eight 
times the rated full-load current. This is objectionable 
as it causes an excessive, though momentary, voltage 
drop in the supply lines feeding the motor and other 
loads. A common method of avoiding this large start-
ing current on medium-sized and small-sized motors 
is Y–Δ starting. The motor is designed to run with its 
stator windings connected in Δ. At starting, however, 
the windings are connected in Y. At a preset interval of 
a few tens of a second after starting, the windings are 
connected in Δ for normal running. 
Assuming that the starting current is proportional to 
the phase voltage, show that the starting current with 
the windings connected in Y is 1/3 of the starting cur-

P25.61	 dc vs. ac high-voltage transmission: Consider a 
Y-connected power transmission system of phase 
voltage Vϕ and line current Il. Compare this to a dc 
power transmission system having the same line 
current Il and line voltages of +VDC and −VDC, with 
the midpoint grounded. To have the same insula-
tion level in both systems, VDC should equal the peak 
phase voltage, that is, V

f. Show that under 
the best conditions, with unity p.f. in the three-
phase system, the power transmitted in the ac case 
is 3 2 2
/(
) that in the dc case, which amounts to only 
1.06 times. However, the ac case uses 50% more con-
ductor and has 50% more I2R loss, compared to the dc 
case. In actual fact the conductors have to be of larger 
cross-sectional area in the ac case for the same cur-
rent-carrying capacity, because under ac conditions, 
the current is not uniformly distributed across the 
cross section of the conductor due to the effect of the 
ac magnetic field inside the conductor, the so-called 
skin effect. Moreover, two line insulators per tower are 
required, compared to three for ac, and the dc tow-
ers are smaller since they have to support fewer con-
ductors and insulators. An additional advantage of 
dc transmission is the absence of reactance, whereas 
the reactance of long ac transmission lines introduces 
problems of power system stability. The power sys-
tems connected by the dc line need not have exactly 
the same frequency. On the downside, since electric 
power is more conveniently generated and utilized 
as ac, ac must be converted to dc at high voltages for 
transmission, which is then converted back to ac for 
distribution. This introduces additional complexity 
and cost.

A.1  The International System of Units
The International System of Units, referred to as the SI 
system (its acronym in French) is almost universally 
used for scientific and engineering purposes and is 
adopted throughout this book. It is a system of physical 
units in which the fundamental quantities are the seven 
listed in Table A.1 together with their corresponding 
units and symbols of these units.
In addition, circuit theory uses many units that are 
derived from these fundamental units. Table A.2 lists 
the more common of these derived units together with 
their relations to other quantities and their unit symbols.
In many practical problems, the SI units defined in the 
table are either too large or too small. Standard prefixes 
in powers of 10 are applied in order to bring the numeral 
preceding the power of 10 to a convenient value, gener-
ally between 1 and 10. Table A.3 lists the prefixes associ-
ated with the SI system of units. The prefixes centi, deci, 
deka, and hecto are not used with electrical quantities. 
The remaining prefixes progress in powers of 10 that are 
divisible by 3.

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
C.1  General
SPICE—the acronym for Simulation Program with 
Integrated Circuit Emphasis—was developed by 
the Electronics Research Laboratory, University of 
California, Berkeley, CA, and made available to the 
public in 1975. Since then it underwent many enhance-
ments and became available in a number of forms. 
OrCAD PSpice for Windows is widely used, particu-
larly in education, and is supplied by Cadence Design 
Systems, Inc. The description in this appendix applies 
specifically to OrCAD 16.6 Demo.
OrCAD software can perform many types of analysis: 
dc, ac, transient, Fourier, transfer function, noise, distor-
tion, and operating point analysis. It can be used for the 
simulation of linear and nonlinear circuits, transmission 
lines, semiconductor devices, digital circuits, and mixed 
analog and digital circuits, in addition to printed circuit 
board preparation.
There are three steps in using PSpice for circuit simu-
lation: (1) describing the circuit to be analyzed by draw-
ing it schematically using the Capture program, (2) 
performing the type of analysis desired, and (3) display-
ing, printing, or plotting the results.
Learning tutorials are included with the Capture pro-
gram. After installing the software, invoke the Capture 
CIS program. CIS stands for Component Information 
System and includes all the features of Capture. When 
the OrCAD Capture window is displayed select Help/
Learning OrCAD Capture CIS or Help/Learning PSpice 
and follow the instructions.
This appendix has been especially prepared to provide 
the information required for effective PSpice simulation of 
circuits in introductory courses on circuit analysis. Most 
of the difficulties commonly encountered are addressed. 
Additional details are given in the simulations of the 
solved examples in this book, as may be needed.
C.2  Starting a New Simulation
	
1.	Run the Capture CIS program. An OrCAD 
Capture CIS—Lite (Start Page) is displayed 
with a Start Page tab.
	
2.	Select Project/New. The New Project Dialog box 
is displayed. Enter a project name and select the 
‘Analog or Mixed A/D’ method of creating a 
new project. Press the Browse button to specify 
a location of the directory where the simulation 
files will be saved. If you have not created such 
a directory, specify a path and press the Create 
Directory button. A Create Directory dialog 
box is opened. Enter a directory name of your 
choice.
	
3.	After the OK buttons are pressed, a Create 
PSpice Project dialog box is displayed. Choose 
Create a blank project. Two tabs are created, one 
in the name of the project, and the other labeled 
Page 1. The Parts toolbar appears on the right-
hand side of the screen.
	
4.	Press the Page 1 tab to display the (SCHEMATIC1: 
PAGE1) window. You are now ready to place 
circuit components on the schematic page. This 
can be done in two ways: either from the Parts 
toolbar or by selecting items from the pull-down 
menu under Place in the menu bar.
	
5.	To place a part using the toolbar, click on the 
Place Part button having the + sign at the top of 
the ­second column, which expands the toolbar 
window. Before parts can be placed, the proper 
libraries must be added. Click on the Add Library 
button, which appears as a dashed rectangle 
under Libraries. The Browse File dialog box 
appears. Select the PSpice directory. Add what-
ever libraries are needed for a particular simula-
tion, such as SOURCE or ANALOG libraries.
	
6.	To select a dc voltage source, for example, high-
light the SOURCE library in the Place Part dia-
log box. A list of available sources appears under 
Part List. Scroll down the list and select VDC. A 
battery symbol appears in the lower right-hand 
corner of the dialog box. Press the Place Part 
button or double-click on the VDC symbol. The 
battery source symbol appears in the schematic 
window attached to an arrow cursor. Move the 
cursor to locate the source at an appropriate 
location in the window and press the left mouse 
button to anchor it in position. Another source 
can be placed by dragging the cursor and sym-
bol to a new location and pressing the left mouse 
button to anchor it in position, and so on. To end 
the insertion process, either press the Esc key 
or the right mouse button and select End Mode 
from the drop-down menu.
	
7.	To place resistors, for example, highlight the 
ANALOG library. Scroll down the list, highlight R, 

774	
Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
then press the Place Part button or double-click 
on the R symbol. Place the resistor at an appro-
priate location in the window. After anchoring 
this resistance by pressing the left mouse but-
ton, move the arrow cursor to place another 
resistor, and so on. To rotate the resistor through 
90° counterclockwise, select it by pressing the 
left mouse button on the resistor symbol and 
press the R key.
	
8.	Any element or text can be moved by selecting 
it with the left mouse button, keeping this but-
ton pressed, and either dragging the selection 
to the desired location by moving the cursor or 
using the arrow keys. It is a good idea to save 
the schematic at this stage by selecting File/
Save from the menu bar.
	
9.	More than one component can be selected 
at the same time by pressing the Ctrl button 
while selecting with the left mouse button. 
Alternatively, the cursor is positioned out-
side one corner of the part of the circuit to be 
selected; the left mouse button is pressed and 
held while the cursor is moved across the parts 
to be selected until the rectangle attached to the 
cursor encloses, or its sides touch, these parts. 
When the left mouse button is released the 
desired parts of the circuit are selected.
	 10.	To wire components, click on the Place wire but-
ton located as the second button in the first col-
umn of the toolbar. The cursor in the schematic 
window changes to a cross hair. Place the cur-
sor at the terminal of a given component and 
press the left mouse button to anchor it. Move 
the cursor and a wire is traced. You can draw a 
straight connection or you can later change to a 
direction at right angles to the initial direction 
in order to draw a right-angled connection. If 
you have to change direction again, you must 
anchor the cursor before doing so by pressing 
the left mouse button. Keep moving the cursor 
till you reach the terminal of the component to 
which the connection is to be made. Press the 
left mouse button to finish the connection. The 
connection remains selected, as indicated by 
the handles, or filled squares, at both ends of the 
connection. You can deselect the connection by 
pressing the Esc key. Press the right mouse but-
ton and select End Wire to finish inserting wires 
or press the Esc key.
The following may be noted concerning wiring:
•	 When a wire crosses another wire, no connec-
tion is made between the two wires. If you 
want to make a connection, pause at the 
intersection, release the left mouse button, 
and continue. A junction is made, as indi-
cated by a small, filled circle. Alternatively, a 
junction can be placed at the intersection by 
using the ‘Place junction’ part from second 
column of the toolbar.
•	 In order to delete a wire connection, select it 
by placing the cursor on it and pressing the left 
mouse button, and then press the Delete key.
•	 If a selected wire is dragged, with the left 
mouse button pressed, all other wires con-
nected to the given wire will remain con-
nected and will move. To isolate the given 
wire, press and hold the Alt key while drag-
ging the wire. The same procedure applies to 
moving a group of selected objects.
•	 To place a wire at an angle other than 0° or 
90°, press and hold the Shift key while draw-
ing the wire at any desired angle.
•	 A part can be placed in the middle of a wire 
segment without redrawing the wire by plac-
ing the part over the wire such that the two 
pins of the part connect with the wire seg-
ment. Then click over the wire segment that 
overlaps the part, so that the pins of the part 
(filled circles) change to wire handles (filled 
squares). Press the Delete key to delete the 
overlapping wire segment. The same proce-
dure is applied in the case of the common mis-
take of accidentally drawing a wire through a 
circuit element, thereby short-circuiting it.
•	 It is recommended that parts are connected 
using wires; that is, avoid connecting parts 
by having the pin of one part overlap the pin 
of another part.
	 11.	To use the Auto-connect-two-points feature in 
OrCAD 16.6 Demo, click on the ‘Auto connect 
two points’ button in the first (leftmost) column 
of the toolbar. The cursor in the schematic win-
dow changes to an x. Move the cursor to one of the 
terminals, press, and release the left mouse but-
ton. Move the cursor to the other terminal, with 
the wire attached to it, and then click and release 
the left mouse button. A connection is automati-
cally made between the two terminals. To use 
auto connect to wire multiple points, click on the 
‘Auto connect multi points’ button in the second 
(rightmost) column of the toolbar. Move the cur-
sor to one of the terminals, press, and release the 
left mouse button. Repeat at every terminal to be 
connected. Finally, right-click anywhere on the 
schematic page and choose Connect.

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation	
775
	 12.	To change the value of a component from the 
default value, double-click on the component 
value in the schematic. A Display Properties 
window appears. Change the value in the Value 
field to the desired value. Scale factors can be 
added, as described later. Press the OK button. 
Once you finished wiring, save the schematic.
	 13.	Before a simulation can be made, a ground 
­connection must be made and a zero value assigned 
to it. Click on the ground button in the sec-
ond column of the toolbar to display the place 
Ground dialog box. If a ground symbol with a 
0 is not displayed in the RHS window, add the 
SOURCE library, select it, and then select  the 
0 in the middle window on the LHS. When the 
ground symbol with a 0 is displayed, press the 
OK button. The dialog box disappears and a 
ground symbol with a 0 is displayed in the sche-
matic window attached to the cursor. Drag the 
symbol to where you want to place the ground 
and anchor it by pressing the left mouse button. 
To stop inserting ground, press the Esc button.
	 14.	To simulate the circuit, select PSpice/New

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
C.5  Simulation Restrictions
•	 A PSpice simulation cannot be run unless the 
ground symbol is connected to a node and a 
value of zero is assigned to ground. Otherwise, 
floating node errors are indicated.
•	 Every node must have a dc connection to ground. 
Otherwise, a floating node error is indicated. 
Capacitors and current sources do not provide a 
dc connection to ground; resistors, inductors, and 
voltage sources do. When a node necessarily does 
not have a dc connection to ground, a floating 
node error can be avoided by connecting a very 
large resistor, say, 1 giga-ohm that does not affect 
the simulation results, between this node and 
ground.
•	 PSpice does not allow a loop of zero dc resistance, 
such as a loop that consists exclusively of volt-
age sources, inductors, or voltage sources and 
inductors. The loop can be broken by inserting 
a very small series resistance, say, 1 nano-ohm 
that does not affect the simulation results.
•	 When entering the value of a component, do not 
enter any space between the number and the 
scale factor. Fractions must be entered in deci-
mal form, for example, 1.66667 and not 5/3.
•	 All PSpice entries are case independent. Hence, 
a resistance value of, say, 15 MΩ is entered as 
15meg, and not as 15M. PSpice will interpret a 
15M resistance as 15 milliohms.
•	 When entering circuit values, the basic unit, 
such as V (for voltage), A (for current), and L (for 
inductance), may be included or omitted. In the 
case of capacitance, omission is mandatory. Thus, 
a capacitance of 1.2 farads is entered simply as 
1.2 and not as 1.2F. PSpice will interpret a 1.2F 
capacitance as 1.2 femtofarads, that is, 1.2 × 10−15 
farads. Resistance is also entered without units. 
A 50 micro-ohm resistance is entered as 50u.
•	 To avoid strange results when using capacitors 
or inductors in time-domain analysis, always 
specify the initial conditions, even if these are 
zero. The initial conditions are entered in the IC 
column of the Property Editor spreadsheet for 
the circuit element.
C.6  Sign Conventions
•	 Positive voltage drop across a capacitor is from 
pin 1 of the element to pin 2. These pins can be 
determined from the Property Editor spreadsheet 
by pressing the pins tab along the bottom of 
the spreadsheet. The node designations of 
the pin numbers are indicated. Initial voltage 
across a capacitor can be assigned accordingly. 
Alternatively, the library ANALOG_P contains 
R and C elements with pin numbers.
•	 Positive current through an inductor flows 
from the marked pin to the unmarked pin. 
Alternatively, the library ANALOG_P contains an 
L element with pin numbers 1 and 2. Initial cur-
rent in an inductor can be assigned accordingly.
•	 In both voltage sources and current sources, the 
positive direction of current inside the source is 
from the positively marked terminal to the neg-
atively marked terminal.
•	 To be consistent with the positive directions of 
voltage and current, positive power is power 
absorbed. The power delivered by a source is 
therefore indicated as negative power.
C.7  Rotating Parts
•	 When a component is placed, it takes a default 
position. For example, a resistor, capacitor, or 
inductor will take a default horizontal position 
with its marked or “1” terminal to the left.
•	 Components may be rotated by pressing the 
­following keys:
H	
Flip part horizontally.
R	
Rotate part 90° counterclockwise.
V	
Flip part vertically.
C.8  Identifying and Labeling Nodes
•	 PSpice assigns a 0 node number to ground and 
arbitrary node numbers to the remaining nodes 
in the circuit. These numbers consist of the letter 
N followed by five numerals. The node number 
can be read by moving the cursor to any wire 
connected to the node.
•	 It is sometimes required to label a node with an 
arbitrary name. This may be necessary to iden-
tify the node in an entry in the simulation pro-
file, or to easily identify it in the output file, or 
to simplify connections in a circuit.
•	 A node is most conveniently labeled using a 
net alias. To do this, click on the ‘Place net alias’ 
button marked ‘abc’ in the second column of 
the Parts toolbar. A Place Net alias window is 
displayed. Enter a name of your choice under 
Alias. Press  the OK button and a rectangle 

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation	
777
appears that is attached to the pointer. Place the 
rectangle next to the wire connecting to the node 
to be labeled and press the left mouse button to 
anchor it. The alias name appears. Press Esc to 
stop placing aliases. The node is now labeled 
with the alias name. The alias can be deleted by 
selecting it and pressing the Delete key.
•	 Note that nodes having the same name are con-
sidered to be connected together, whether in the 
same page or in different pages.
C.9  Working with Pages
•	 To add a new schematic page to a project, access 
the Project Manager, block, and click on Design 
Resources all the way to SCHEMATIC1. Press 
the right mouse button on SCHEMATIC1 and 
select New Page from the menu that pops up. 
Enter a page name, if desired, and press the OK 
button.
•	 A circuit can be copy-pasted from one page 
to another. The whole circuit is selected as 
described in item 9 of Section C.2. A copy-paste 
is then performed from one page to another.
•	 When a circuit is copy-pasted from one page to 
another, part numbers of components are auto-
matically changed to preserve the integrity of 
the circuit in each page. Net aliases, however, 
are not automatically changed, so that PSpice 
would consider nodes on different pages hav-
ing the same net alias to be connected together. 
To prevent this, the net aliases must be changed 
manually in the new page.
•	 A page can be renamed or edited by double-
clicking on the page name.
•	 Circuits on different pages can be connected by 
power connectors or off-page connectors.
•	 To connect a power connector to a node, 
click on the ‘Place power’ button in the sec-
ond column of the Parts toolbar. The Place 
Power window appears. Select the CAPSYM 
library. Scroll down the list and select one of 
the last four entries: VCC_ARROW, VCC_
BAR, VCC_CIRCLE, and VCC_WAVE. Each 
of these refers to a different graphic sym-
bol for the connector. Suppose you choose 
VCC_CIRCLE. Click OK and the connector 
with this name appears attached to the cur-
sor. Move it to the node to be labeled, press 
the left mouse button and press Esc to stop 
placing connectors. The node is now labeled 
with the name VCC_CIRCLE. To change this 
name, double-click on it and enter the name 
of your choice in the Value field of the Display 
properties window. Note that although 
PSpice refers to these connectors as power 
connectors, they can be used with any node.
•	 To connect an off-page connector to a node, 
click on the ‘Place off-page connector’ but-
ton from the first column of the toolbar. 
The Place Off-Page Connector window 
appears. Select the CAPSYM library. Two 
choices are available: OFFPAGELEFT-L and 
OFFPAGELEFT-R that differ in the direction 
of the double arrow that will be attached 
to the node. Either one may be used. Select 
one of the symbols, drag it to the node to be 
labeled, anchor it, and rename it, as for the 
power connector.
•	 To clear garbage from the drawing page, select 
View/Zoom and click on Redraw or press the 
F5 key. The screen will be cleared and redrawn.
C.10  Markers
•	 Voltage and current markers can be added to 
the schematic and used in conjunction with the 
plot window. The markers obviate the need for 
labeling nodes and invoking Trace/Add Trace 
in the Simulation Results page when only rela-
tively simple plots are required.
•	 Four markers are available identified as Voltage 
Level, Voltage Differential, Current into Pin, 
and Power Dissipation. These markers can be 
applied by pressing the appropriate button in 
the bottom row of the menu.
•	 Choosing any of these markers results in a 
marker symbol attached to the cursor, which 
can be moved and located at appropriate points 
in the schematic. After locating a marker, press 
the Esc button to stop locating a marker of a 
given type.
•	 Power dissipation markers are attached to 
the body of a PSpice device, current mark-
ers are attached to pins, and voltage markers 
are attached to pins, wires, or buses. The first 
attachment of a Voltage Differential marker is 
labeled V+, whereas the second is labeled V−. 
The value displayed is that of (V+ − V−).
•	 Power markers indicate the power absorbed 
by the marked circuit element. Under ac con-
ditions, this is the average power for a resistor, 
the reactive power for a capacitor or inductor, 
and the complex power for a source.

778	
Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
•	 Adding a marker automatically adds a plot to 
the plot window in the SCHEMATIC1 page, the 
color of each plot being that of the correspond-
ing marker.
•	 Markers can be rotated just like circuit 
components.
C.11  Simulation Profile
•	 Every simulation must have a simulation profile. 
When a new simulation is started, clicking on 
the New Simulation Profile button in the PSpice 
toolbar opens a New Simulation dialog box. A 
name is entered for the simulation profile in the 
‘Name’ field to allow performing different sim-
ulations on the same circuit. The ‘Inherit From’ 
field allows using entries from another simula-
tion profile, the default entry being ‘none’.
•	 Clicking on the Create button in the New 
Simulation dialog box opens the Simulation 
Settings window having the name chosen for 
the simulation profile. Four choices of ‘Analysis 
type’ are available:
•	 Bias Point: Suitable for dc circuit analy-
sis. Under ‘Options’, ‘General Settings’ is 
selected by default. No selections or entries 
are made under ‘Output File Options’ for 
straightforward dc circuit analysis.
•	 DC Sweep: Used for sweeping the value of a 
current source, a voltage source, or a global 
parameter, as described in the solved examples 
in this book for deriving Thevenin’s equivalent 
circuit, Norton’s equivalent circuit, or maxi-
mum power transfer, all under dc conditions.
•	 AC Sweep/Noise: Used for steady-state sinu-
soidal conditions, frequency responses, or 
maximum power transfer under ac condi-
tions, as described in the solved examples in 
this book.
•	 Time Domain (Transient): Used for transient 
analysis and Fourier analysis, as described in 
the solved examples in this book.
•	 It should be emphasized that since PSpice simu-
lations are performed at a succession of discrete 
values of the variable, or points, along the hori-
zontal axis, then to obtain a smooth curve, a suf-
ficient number of points must be included in the 
simulation. This number is determined by the 
‘Increment’ entry in DC Sweep, the ‘Total Points’ 
or ‘Points/Decade’ entries in AC Sweep/Noise, 
and the ‘Maximum step size’ entry in Time-
Domain (Transient) analysis.
•	 Too small a value for the number of points 
results in a “jagged” curve that looks like a 
series of straight-line segments and limits 
the accuracy of the reading of the variable on 
the horizontal axis. For example, in a time-
domain analysis having a simulation time of 
1 s and a ‘Maximum step size’ of 1 ms, the 
total number of simulation points is 1/10−3 
or 1000. Successive points are separated by 
1 ms, so it’s not possible to read values of 
time to an accuracy better than 1 ms.
•	 On the other hand, too large a value for the 
number of points unnecessarily prolongs 
simulation time and increases the size of 
the simulation file. Generally speaking, it is 
a good idea to aim for about 2,000 to 5,000 
points along the horizontal axis.
C.12  Linear and Ideal Transformers
•	 To simulate a two-winding linear transformer 
enter part XFRM_LINEAR, which is the last 
entry in the ANALOG library. In the Property 
Editor Spreadsheet of the transformer, enter 
under COUPLING the appropriate value of the 
coupling coefficient k. Enter under L1_VALUE 
the inductance value of the coil on the left, and 
under L2_VALUE the inductance value of the coil 
on the right.
•	 The default dot markings on the linear trans-
former are at the upper terminal of each coil. 
If the dot markings are to be reversed, either 
the connections to one of the coils should be 
reversed or a negative value entered for the cou-
pling coefficient.
•	 If the terminals of one coil are open-circuited, 
PSpice will give an error that less than two con-
nections are made to that node. Under these 
conditions connect a very large resistance, say 
1  GΩ, across the coil terminals, or connect a 
voltage printer to the node.
•	 To simulate a two-winding ideal transformer 
use XFRM_LINEAR, with k = 1 and very large 
values, of the order of megahenries, for the 
inductances of the two coils but with the ratios 
of the inductances equal to the square of the 
turns ratio.
•	 XFRM_LINEAR does not have a provision for 
initial current values. It is therefore suitable 
for steady-state sinusoidal simulations. For 
time domain analysis, the initial value must be 
enforced in the circuit by switches or current 

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation	
779
sources. In these cases, and in cases of trans-
formers having two or more windings, the part 
K_Linear in the ANALOG library should be 
used. Each winding is entered as an inductor 
having its marked terminal in the same circuit 
location as the dot marking of the correspond-
ing winding. A K_Linear entry is used to couple 
every two inductors together in accordance 
with the coupling coefficient between the two 
windings involved, using the part numbers of 
the inductors in the circuit.
C.13  Ideal Op Amp
•	 An ideal op amp is available from the Analog 
library as part OPAMP. The default gain is 106 
and the default power supplies are +15 V and 
−15 V, but these can be changed in the Property 
Editor spreadsheet of the op amp, as may be 
desired.
C.14  Global Parameter
•	 PSpice allows the variation of a parameter such 
as a resistance value Ro.
•	 To allow variation of Ro, it has to be declared a 
global parameter, as follows:
•	 Double-click on the value of Ro. In the 
Display Properties window, enter under 
Value: {R_val}, where R_val is a name arbi-
trarily assigned to Ro, and the curly brackets 
designate a parameter entry.
•	 From the SPECIAL library, enter the part 
PARAM. The word PARAMETERS: is dis-
played on the schematic.
•	 Double-click on PARAMETERS: to display 
its Property Editor spreadsheet. Click on 
New Column tab and enter in the Add New 
Column window R_val under Name and 
an arbitrary number, say 5, under value. 
Then click OK. It is convenient to have the 
Name and Value displayed. They would 
appear as R_val = 5 under PARAMETERS:.
•	 Select in the Simulation Settings the type of 
analysis required, such as DC Sweep, AC 
Sweep, or Transient analysis. Under Sweep 
variable, choose Global parameter and enter 
R_val under variable name. Under Sweep type, 
choose Linear and enter 1, say, for Start value, a 
convenient value, say, 25 for End value and 0.01 
for Increment.
•	 Run the simulation. A graph will be displayed 
having the horizontal axis labeled R_val with 
values from 1 to 25. Select Trace/Add trace then 
choose W(R5), assuming the Part reference for 
Ro is R5. A graph of power dissipated vs. R_val 
will be displayed.
C.15  Switches
•	 PSpice allows the use of (1) a normally open 
switch that is closed at a certain time, the switch 
part name being Sw_tClose (read as switch to 
close), and (2) a normally closed switch that is 
opened at a certain time, the switch part name 
being Sw_tOpen (read as switch to open). Both 
of these parts are in the EVAL library.
•	 Switch parameters have to be set in the Property 
Editor spreadsheet as follows:
•	 TCLOSE—for a Sw_tClose, this is the time at 
which the switch closes. You may leave this 
parameter at the default value of zero, unless 
a closing time other than zero is required.
•	 TOPEN—for a Sw_tOpen, this is the time 
at which the switch opens. You may leave 
this parameter at the default value of zero, 
unless an opening time other than zero is 
required.
•	 TTRAN—the transition time for switch clo-
sure. Leave this parameter at the default 
value of 1 μs. Since this is usually much 
smaller than the time constant of the cir-
cuit, the closing of the switch is essentially 
instantaneous. In cases of very fast tran-
sients, it may be necessary to enter a smaller 
value.
•	 RCLOSED—the resistance of the switch 
when closed. Leave this parameter at the 
default value of 0.01 Ω. Since this is usually 
much smaller than the resistance in series 
with the switch, the switch appears as a short 
circuit when closed. In circuits involving 
small or zero resistance, it may be necessary 
to enter a smaller resistance value.
•	 ROPEN—the resistance of the switch when 
open. Leave this parameter at the default 
value of 1 MΩ. Since this resistance is usually 
much larger than the resistance in series with 
the switch, the switch appears essentially as 
an open circuit. In circuits involving very 
large resistances, it may be necessary to enter 
a larger resistance value.

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
C.16  Printers
•	 In the sinusoidal steady state, printers are used 
to determine voltage and current values. For 
current measurement, a two-terminal IPRINT 
printer is available from the SPECIAL library. 
The printer is connected so that current in the 
assigned positive direction enters the unmarked 
terminal of the printer and leaves at the termi-
nal marked with a minus sign.
•	 For voltage measurement, two printers are 
available from the SPECIAL library: (1) 
VPRINT1, which has one terminal only, and 
therefore measures voltage with respect to 
ground, and (2) VPRINT2, which has two ter-
minals and measures the voltage drop from 
the unmarked terminal to the terminal marked 
with a minus sign.
•	 In order to use any of the printers, appropri-
ate entries must be made in the Property Editor 
spreadsheet of the printer. For ac measurements, 
a Y must be entered under ac in the Property 
Editor spreadsheet of each printer. A Y is also 
entered under REAL and IMAG to express com-
plex values in rectangular form, or a Y is entered 
under MAG and PHASE to express complex 
values in polar form.
•	 The values measured by the printers are read 
from the output file under the respective 
printer.
C.17  Evaluate Measurements
•	 An alternative to using printers for reading 
values of currents and voltages is to use the 
‘Evaluate Measurement’ feature of PSpice. In the 
SCHEMATIC1-(simulation name)-page, select 
‘Trace/Evaluate Measurement’. Two windows 
are displayed. Under ‘Functions or Macros’ 
in the right-hand window, choose ‘Analog 
Operators and Functions’. To read magnitudes, 
select the voltage or current required from the 
left-hand window labeled ‘Simulation Output 
Variables’. To read phase angles, select P(), and 
then select the variable required. For example, 
to read the voltage of the node labeled ‘a’, V(a) 
and P(V(a)) are selected.
•	 The values are displayed in a window under the 
graph. This window can be displayed or hidden 
by clicking on the ‘Toggle Measurement Results 
Window’ button in the Probe toolbar.
•	 Evaluate Measurement can be used for measur-
ing filter parameters, such as Q and 3-dB band-
width. However, the measurements may not 
be reliable in the case of low-Q filters or filters 
having capacitors as the only energy storage 
elements. In these cases, the cursor should be 
used, as described in Section C.25.
C.18  Dependent Sources
Dependent sources are listed in the ANALOG library 
under the following part names:
E: Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS)
F: Current-controlled current source (CCCS)
G: Voltage-controlled current source (VCCS)
H: Current-controlled voltage source (CCVS)
Since they are controlled sources, dependent sources 
automatically assume the same time variation as the 
controlling quantity, whether dc, ac, etc.
C.19  Sources for the Sinusoidal Steady State
•	 For the sinusoidal steady state, a voltage 
source VAC and a current source IAC are avail-
able from the SOURCE library. Each of these 
sources, when entered, has default values of 
0Vdc and 1Vac for VAC or 0Adc and 1Aac for 
IAC. The sources allow simultaneous simula-
tion of dc and sinusoidal steady state. For a 
purely sinusoidal state, the dc value should be 
left at zero.
•	 The magnitude that is entered for VAC or IAC 
is interpreted by PSpice as an rms value. Since 
the responses are directly proportional to source 
values, the entered source values can be con-
sidered as peak values, in which case all mag-
nitudes of voltages and currents will be peak 
values. However, if power values are required, 
the power value calculated by PSpice is based 
on considering source values to be rms.
•	 A phase value can be assigned to a source by 
entering the phase angle in degrees in the 
ACPHASE row of the Property Editor spread-
sheet. If only one source is present in the circuit, 
the phase angles of all responses are relative to 
that of the source, which has a default value of 
zero, so no phase angle need be assigned to the 
source. However, if more than one ac source is 
present, with the sources having different phase 
angles, then the appropriate phase angle should 
be entered for each source.

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation	
781
•	 When performing the simulation, choose 
AC Sweep/Noise for Analysis type in the 
Simulation Settings. Choose Linear under AC 
Sweep Type and enter the source frequency in 
Hz, not in rad/s, under both Start Frequency 
and End Frequency. Since the start and end fre-
quencies are the same, enter 1 for ‘Total points’.
•	 Note that in some problems the frequency may 
not be specified but the reactance values may 
be given. To perform the simulation, assume 
any convenient frequency and enter the val-
ues of inductors or capacitors accordingly. 
For example, if the reactance of an inductor is 
given as 10 Ω, and f = 1 Hz is assumed, then 
enter the value of the inductance as 1.59155, 
which is 10/(2π).
C.20  Time-Varying Sinusoidal Sources
•	 PSpice ISIN and VSIN implement an expo-
nentially decaying sinusoidal current source 
and an exponentially decaying sinusoidal 
voltage, respectively. When placed on the 
Schematic page, some parameters are attached 
to the source, namely, IOFF or VOFF, IAMPL 
or VAMPL, and FREQ. These parameters are 
explained in the following text for ISIN, with 
reference to Figure C.1, the meaning being 
similar for VSIN. In addition, VSIN has an AC 
parameter, which stands for the rms value. 
This parameter can be ignored when VAMPL 
is used.
•	 IOFF is the offset of the sinusoid from the 0 
level, as indicated in the figure. IOFF = 0 for a 
sinusoidal function of zero average.
•	 IAMPL is the amplitude of the sinusoid.
•	 FREQ is the frequency in Hz.
•	 In addition, the following parameters can be 
entered using the Property Editor spreadsheet 
for the source, if needed:
•	 PHASE is the phase angle in degrees, assum-
ing a sine function. Thus the default value is 
zero, and PHASE = 90 for a cosine function.
•	 TD is time of the start of the sinusoid with 
respect to t = 0. TD = 0 for a sinωt function 
and is the default value.
•	 DF is the damping factor and is the recipro-
cal of the time constant of the exponential 
decay of the amplitude of the sinusoid. DF is 
entered in units of seconds. For a sinusoidal 
function of constant amplitude, DF = 0 and is 
the default value.
C.21  Pulse Sources
•	 The VPULSE and IPULSE sources in the 
SOURCE library allow the application of an 
­excitation consisting of a single pulse, or any num-
ber of pulses, or a periodic pulse train. The pulse 
may be rectangular, triangular, or trapezoidal in 
shape, depending on the parameter values entered.
•	 The interpretation of the parameters of VPULSE 
is as follows (Figure C.2):
V1:	
The lower level of the pulses.
V2:	
The upper level of the pulses.
TD:	
Time delay before the level changes from V1 
to V2.
TR:	
Time rise of the pulse; for a rectangular 
pulse, TR should be very small but should 
not be zero as this may produce strange 
spikes in the waveforms.
TF:	
Time fall of the pulse; for a rectangular 
pulse, TF should be very small but should 
not be zero as this may produce strange 
spikes in the waveforms.

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
PW:	 Duration of the V2 level; for a triangular 
pulse, PW should be very small but should 
not be zero.
PER:	 Time between repetition of pulses; to obtain 
a single pulse, PER is made larger than the 
duration of the simulation; similarly to 
obtain a specified number of pulses. For 
the response to a periodic pulse train, the 
simulation is started after a sufficient time is 
allowed for the circuit to reach a steady state.
C.22  Piecewise-Linear Sources
•	 The VPWL and IPWL, or piecewise-linear, 
sources in the SOURCE library allow the applica-
tion of an excitation having a waveform consist-
ing of straight-line segments between up to eight 
breakpoints. When the excitation level changes 
from one breakpoint to the next, the variation is 
linear.
•	 As an example, consider a waveform that sud-
denly changes from 0 to 2 V at t = 0, stays at 2 V 
until t = 4 s, and then decreases to 0 at t = 6 s. 
To generate this waveform, enter in the Property 
Editor spreadsheet of the source, the following 
breakpoints and the corresponding voltage levels:
T1 = 0
V1 = 0
T2 = 0
V2 = 2
T3 = 4
V3 = 2
T4 = 6
V4 = 0
•	 The waveform has a step at t = 0. The volt-
age is maintained at 2 V till t = 4 s and then 
decreases linearly to zero at t = 6 s.
•	 The piecewise-linear waveform can be applied 
n times in succession, or continuously. In the 
former case, the sources VPWL_RE_N_TIMES 
and IPWL_RE_N_TIMES are used, whereas in 
the latter case the sources VPWL_RE_FOREVER 
and IPWL_RE_FOREVER are used. The use of 
VPWL_RE_FOREVER is described in a solved 
example on responses to periodic inputs.
C.23  Exponential Sources
•	 The exponential source in PSpice is IEXP or 
VEXP (Figure C.3).
•	 I1 is the level from which the rising exponential 
begins and toward which the decaying expo-
nential falls.
•	 I2 is the level which the rising exponential 
approaches.
•	 TD1 is the time at which the rising exponential 
begins.
•	 TD2 is the time at which the decaying exponen-
tial begins.
•	 TC1 and TC2 are the respective time constants.
•	 To simulate an exponential of the form 
I
e
t
=
-
10
5 A, choose I1 = 0, I2 = 10, TD1 = 0, 
TC1 = 0, TD2 = 0, and TC2 = 0.2.
C.24  Analog Behavioral Modules
•	 A number of useful functions are available 
from the Analog Behavioral Modules (ABM) 
PSpice library, which can be used to implement 
a variety of mathematical and other operations.
•	 Useful functions are the ABS function that gives 
the absolute value of a function, LIMIT that lim-
its the maximum and minimum values of a func-
tion, SUM that adds two functions, MULT that 
multiplies two inputs, CONST that provides a 
constant value that can be used in addition or 
multiplication, and LAPLACE that implements 
an arbitrary transfer function.
•	 For example, to obtain a full-wave rectified 
waveform, enter VSIN or ISIN followed by 
the ABS block from the ABM PSpice library. 
The output of this block is the absolute value 
of the input. To obtain a half-wave rectified 
­waveform, add a LIMIT block, or a GLIMIT to 
provide some gain.
C.25  Working with Plots
•	 The zoom feature can be used to enlarge a cer-
tain part of the plot for closer examination of 
details. Select View/Zoom. A menu appears 
that lists ­several ways of zooming in or out.

Suppose Area is chosen. The cursor changes to 
crosshairs. Position the cursor at a corner of the 
area to be enlarged. While pressing and hold-
ing the left mouse button, move the cursor so as 
to enclose the desired area within the rectangle 
attached to the cursor. When the mouse button is 
released the selected area appears enlarged to fit 
the screen. Further zooming of part of the selected 
area can be made. To return to a previous view, 
select View/Zoom/Previous. Zooming can also 
be done using the buttons on the Probe toolbar.
•	 Text can be placed on the screen by using the 
menus or the Parts toolbar. To use the menus, 
select Plot/Label/Text and enter in the win-
dow that appears the text it is desired to dis-
play. When you click OK, the text string will 
appear attached to the mouse. Drag the text to 
the desired location and press the left mouse 
button to anchor the text. Type CTRL-L to clear 
any undesired text fragments that may appear. 
The text can also be dragged to a new location. 
Alternatively, text can be placed on the screen by 
clicking on the ‘abc’ button in the Probe toolbar.
•	 The cursor can be displayed by choosing Trace/
Cursor/Display or by clicking once on the 
‘Toggle cursor’ button in the Probe toolbar. Once 
the cursor is displayed, cursor 1 can be moved by 
means of the left and right arrow keys. Pressing 
Shift while using these keys moves cursor 2. 
Clicking again on the ‘Toggle cursor’ button in 
the Probe toolbar hides the cursors.
•	 When the cursors are enabled, a number of 
­buttons are highlighted in the Cursor tool-
bar that can be used for locating either cursor 
at various parts of the waveform. Clicking on 
the Cursor Max button, for example, moves the 
selected cursor to the maximum of the graph.
•	 Moving the arrow cursor of the page to a 
particular point on the graph and clicking 
on the Cursor Point button moves the cur-
sor to this point. Clicking on the Mark Label 
button displays the coordinates of the point.
•	 The x- and y-values at a given cursor position 
are indicated in a cursor window in the bot-
tom RHS of the page.
•	 When more than one trace is displayed, the fol-
lowing applies:
•	 Each trace is identified by a small square of 
the same color as the corresponding trace. 
The variable whose variation is displayed by 
the trace appears next to this square. Clicking 
on the variable name highlights it. Pressing 
the Delete key deletes the trace.
•	 Clicking on the small colored square moves 
cursor 1 from one trace to another, as indi-
cated by a highlighted, dotted-line square 
surrounding the colored square.
•	 The same numerical vertical scale applies to 
all traces. Thus, to display a current in mA 
simultaneously with a voltage in volts, where 
the numerical values of both traces are compa-
rable, either the current must be multiplied by 
103 or the voltage divided by 103.
•	 When using a single frequency, a small dash is dis-
played at the specified frequency. If it is attempted 
to read the value on the y-axis using the cursor, a 
“There is no valid trace to exam.” message is dis-
played. The value can be read by selecting Trace/
Evaluate Measurement (Section C.17).
C.26  Search Commands
The search command can be used with the cursor, after 
the cursor is displayed by selecting Trace/Cursor/
Display or clicking on the ‘Toggle cursor’ button in the 
Probe toolbar. The search feature is invoked by select-
ing Trace/Cursor/Search Commands or clicking on the 
Cursor Search button in the Cursor toolbar. A window 
appears for entering the search command and for select-
ing whether the command is to apply to cursor 1 or 2. 
The syntax of the search command is as follows, without 
space separations:
	
search direction
start

Square brackets indicate optional arguments. Searches 
are case independent so that uppercase or lowercase 
characters can be used. Abbreviations can also be used 
for the various entries illustrated as follows:
•	 The command must start with the word ‘search’ 
or the letter ‘s’.
•	 direction could be forward (the default), entered 
with forward or f, or it could be backward, 
entered with backward or b.
•	 condition must be entered from one of the fol-
lowing options, each of which can be entered 
using the first two letters only, shown italicized:
•	 peak, finds the data point with the [#­consecutive_
points#] on each side having lower y-­values 
than the peak data point. For example, if the 
command is sf#2#pe, the peak searched for 

784	
Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
is a data point with two neighboring data 
points of lower value.
•	 max, finds the greatest y-value for all points 
in the specified x-range. If there is more than 
one maximum having the same y-values, 
the nearest one is found. max is not affected 
by [direction], [#consecutive_points#], or 
[repeat:].
•	 trough, similar to peak, but in the opposite 
sense.
•	 min, similar to max, but in the opposite sense.
•	 slope[(posneg)], finds the maximum slope, 
which could be positive, and is specified as 
sl(p), or could be negative, specified as sl(n), 
or could be both, specified as sl(b).
•	 point, finds the next data point in the given 
direction.
•	 xvalue<(value)>, finds the first point on the 
curve that has the specified x-value, where 
value can be a number (e.g., 10n or 1E5), a 
percentage (e.g., 50%), a marked point 
(e.g.,  x5), a value relative to max or min 
(e.g., max-2), a value relative to start value 
(e.g., .-3), where a dot denotes the start value, 
or a dB value relative to a max or min (e.g., 
max-3). xvalue is not affected by [direc-
tion], 
[#consecutive_points#], 
[(range_x 
[,range_y])], or [repeat:]. For example, sxv(5) 
searches for the point whose x-value is 5.
•	 level<(value[,posneg])> 
finds 
the 
next 
point at a certain value relative to the given 
level. [,posneg] has the same significance 
as in the slope[(posneg)] command and 
value has the same significance as in the 
xvalue<(value)> command. For example, 
sle(10) searches for the point whose y value 
is 10; sfle(max-3db) searches forward for 
the next point that is 3 dB below the maxi-
mum value of the trace.
•	 /start_point/ specifies the starting point to begin 
a search, the current point being the default. 
^ and $ denote, respectively, the first and last 
point in the search range.
•	 (range_x [, range_y]) specifies the range of val-
ues that the search is confined to, the search 
is inclusive of the range values specified. The 
range can be specified as floating-point values, 
as a percent of the full range, as marked points, 
or as an expression of marked points. The 
default range is all points available. The first 
comma separates the limits of the x-range. The 
second comma separates the x-range values 
from the y-range values, and the third comma 
separates the limits of the y-range. For example, 
(1n,200n) specifies an x-range of 1 to 200 nano 
and a full y-range. (1.5,20E−9,0,1m) specifies 
an x-range of 1.5–20 nano and a y-range from 
0 to 1 milli. (,,1,3) specifies a full x-range and a 
y-range from 1 to 3.
•	 repeat: specifies which occurrence of <condi-
tion> to find. For example, sb2:le(3,p) searches 
backward for the second crossing of the positive 
3 V level, assuming y-values are in volts.
As an example, the command

searches forward for the fifth occurrence of a 3 V, 
­positive going, y level crossing that has at least four 
consecutive points at or beyond 3 volts, only searching 
within the x-value range of 1–5ns.
C.27  Frequency Responses
•	 AC sweep is used to plot the frequency response. 
The desired frequency range in Hz is entered in 
the simulation profile as a start frequency and 
an end frequency, usually extending over five 
decades. Use a logarithmic AC sweep type with 
at least 1000 points/decade to obtain a smooth 
curve.
•	 To obtain the transfer function, use a VAC or an 
IAC source, as appropriate, having a value of 
unity. Although a voltage marker can be used 
at the desired output, the resulting y-scale is lin-
ear and has to be changed to dB. It is usually 
more convenient to name the desired output, 
say vo, and select Trace/Add Trace in the sche-
matic page. Select DB( ) from the list of Analog 
Operators and Functions in the RH window, 
and then select V(vo) from the list in the LH 
window so as to obtain the Trace Expression 
DB(V(vo)). Press the OK button and the plot 
appears in the plot window.
•	 Measurements can be made using cursor search 
commands, as explained in Section C.26. To 
obtain the maximum of a low-pass, high-pass, 
or bandpass response, press the ‘Toggle ­cursor’ 
button in the Probe toolbar, and then press the 
Cursor Max button in the Cursor toolbar. The 
cursor will move to the position of the maxi-
mum and the values can be read in the Probe 

Appendix C: PSpice Simulation	
785
Cursor window. Press the OK button and the 
value appears in the Measurement Results 
­window under the plot.
•	 The 3 dB frequency can be read using the com-
mand sle(max-3). In the case of a bandpass 
response, the command can be used with cur-
sor 2 to obtain the lower 3 dB frequency and the 
command used twice with cursor 1 to obtain the 
upper 3 dB frequency. The frequencies and their 
difference, the bandwidth, can be read in the 
Probe Cursor window.
•	 Alternatively, the Evaluate Measurement fea-
ture can be used to obtain the bandwidth. 
Press the Evaluate Measurement button in the 
Probe toolbar. An Evaluate Measurement win-
dow is opened. To obtain the 3 dB bandwidth 
of a bandpass response, for example, select the 
second entry in the list in the RH window and 
select V(vo) from the list in the LH window so 
as to obtain the Trace Expression Bandwidth_
Bandpass_3dB(V(vo)). Press the OK button to 
display the value in the Measurement Results 
window under the plot window.
•	 As noted previously, some results of Evaluate 
Measurement may not be reliable in the case of 
low-Q circuits or circuits having capacitors as 
the only energy storage elements.
C.28  Trace Expressions
•	 A plot can be added to the displayed plotted 
results by entering the appropriate expression 
in the Trace Expression field of the Add Traces 
window of the SCHEMATIC1-(simulation 
name) page.
•	 For example, to add an asymptote of slope −20 dB/
decade to a low-pass response displayed in dB 
on a logarithmic frequency scale, enter the exp­
ression: −20*log10(Frequency)−20*log10(fc)+A,  
where fc is the 3 dB cutoff frequency in Hz and 
A is the low-frequency gain in dB.
•	 In entering trace expressions, Analog Operators 
and Functions can be entered from the list in 
the RH window of the Add Traces window. It 
is useful to note that D( ) is the derivative and 
PWR(a,b) is equivalent to ab. Thus, 10,000 can be 
entered as PWR(10,4).
•	 Frequency and Time appear in the list of 
Simulation Output Variables in the LH window 
of the Add Traces window. It is assumed in the 
trace expressions that the values of these vari-
ables are in Hz and seconds, respectively.
C.29  Fourier Analysis
•	 PSpice can be used to obtain a printout of the 
amplitude and phase of each frequency compo-
nent of a periodic waveform and to display its 
amplitude spectrum.
•	 In performing Fourier analysis, when a peri-
odic input is applied to a circuit at t = 0, suffi-
cient time should be allowed for the output to 
reach a steady state. This time can be selected 
by first observing the output starting at t = 0, 
and determining the number of periods it takes 
the output to become very nearly periodic. 
PSpice is then instructed to collect data for one 
period after this initial time. For example, if 
the period is 1/120 s or 25/3 ms, data should 
be collected staring at, say, 300 ms in order 
to perform a Fourier analysis on the output 
voltage.
•	 It is convenient to assign names to the vari-
ables on which the Fourier analysis is to be 
performed. An input voltage, for example, 
can be labeled as VI, whereas an output volt-
age can be labeled as VO. Labeling can be 
done as described in Section C.8 on using a 
net alias.
•	 To perform Fourier analysis in the aforemen-
tioned example, select Time-Domain (Transient) 
analysis in the Simulation Settings. Enter 
308.3333m for ‘Run to time’, 300m for ‘Start 
­saving data after’, and 0.1m for ‘Maximum step 
size’.
•	 Check the box for ‘Skip the initial transient bias 
point calculation’, then click the ‘Output File 
Options’ button to display the Transient Output 
File Options window.
•	 Check the Perform Fourier Analysis box. For 
Center Frequency, enter the frequency in Hz, 
which is 120 in the aforementioned example. 
Then enter the number of harmonics to be 
included in the Fourier analysis, say 5. Under 
‘Output Variables’ enter V(VI) followed by a 
space then V(VO).
•	 After the simulation is run, the output file gives for 
VI and VO the dc value and the frequency, mag-
nitude, and phase of each frequency component.
•	 To display the amplitude spectrum, select 
Trace/Fourier, and then Trace/Add Trace for 
V(VI) and V(VO). Change the scale of the axis by 
selecting Plot/Axis Settings. In the Axis Settings 
window, select User Defined under XAxis Data 
range and enter 0–600 Hz, for example. A plot of 

786	
Appendix C: PSpice Simulation
triangles is displayed, the peaks of the triangles 
being at the frequencies of the dc component, 
fundamental, and harmonics.
•	 PSpice assumes a periodic function of the form 
f t

f . Hence, a cosω0t 
term will be considered as sin(ω0t + 90°) and 
assigned a phase angle of 90°.
C.30  Graph and Data Copying
•	 The whole graph window can be copied to 
the clipboard by selecting Window/Copy to 
Clipboard. A window is displayed in which 
various choices concerning colors of traces 
and background can be made. After making 
these choices, pressing the OK button copies 
the graph window to the clipboard. The graph 
window can then be pasted in another program 
such as Word or PowerPoint.
•	 Data can be copied from a Probe trace to Excel, 
where it can be processed or exported to other pro-
grams such as MATLAB. To copy data in this man-
ner, simply click on the text label identifying the 
trace and located below the window displaying 
the trace. With the text highlighted and selected, 
copy to the clipboard using Edit/Copy, or CTRL C, 
and then paste in Excel. The data are copied in two 
columns: the first column contains the data from 
the independent, x-axis variable, whereas the sec-
ond contains data from the y-axis variable. The 
labels of the two axes appear in the first row, but 
with leading spaces, which can be easily removed. 
The data from more than one trace can be copied at 
the same time by highlighting more than one text 
label, with the CTRL button pressed.

Appendix D: Complex Numbers and Algebra
D.1  Definitions and Notation
Imaginary numbers arise when taking the square roots 
of negative numbers. Thus, 9
3
= ± , since multiplying 
+3 or −3 by itself gives 9. But what about -9? Whereas 
9 is a real number ±
(
)
3 , -9 is said to be an ­imaginary 
number. It is evaluated by defining a quantity j as being 
equal to 
-1. Then j2  =  −1, and 
-
=
9
9
2j
. Now we 
have two positive quantities under the square root, so 
the square root becomes ±j3. This is a valid answer, 
because (j3)(j3) = j29 = −9 = (−j3)(−j3).
Defined in this way, imaginary numbers are a ­perfectly 
valid set of numbers, just like real numbers, integers, or 
rational numbers. j, the basis of all imaginary numbers, 
is of course itself an imaginary number, and all imagi-
nary numbers are multiplied by j. Imaginary numbers 
can be manipulated according to certain logical and con-
sistent rules.
A complex number x is defined as the sum of a real 
number and an imaginary number:
	
x
a
jb
=
+
	
(D.1)
where a is referred to as the real part of x and b as the 
imaginary part. Complex numbers are commonly 
encountered in algebra and trigonometry. For example, 
the equation x2 + x + 1 does not have real roots, but it 
does have complex roots, that is, roots that are com-
plex numbers. The sine and cosine functions may be 
expressed in terms of complex quantities:
	
cos

(D.2)
These relations can be readily verified using the infi-
nite series representations of the exponential, sine, and 
cosine functions.
The conjugate of a complex number x, denoted as x*, 
is the number that has the same real part but a negated 
imaginary part. Thus, a + jb and a − jb are conjugates.
Complex quantities play a central role in electric 
circuits. They are the basis for phasor notation. They 
are also encountered in Fourier series, Fourier and 
Laplace transforms, and in the extensive applications 
that derive from the theory of functions of complex 
variables.
D.2  Graphical Representation
A complex number may be represented in rectangular 
form as a point in the complex plane or Argand ­diagram. 
This is the familiar two-dimensional, Cartesian coordi-
nate plane except that the vertical axis is denoted as the 
imaginary axis (Figure D.1). A complex number a + jb 
is represented as a point whose horizontal coordinate 
is a and vertical coordinate is b. Figure D.1 illustrates 
several such examples where the number is real (such 
as 1, 4, −3), imaginary (such as j2, −j4), or complex (such 
as 4 + j3, 4 − j3, −3 + j4, −5 − j4). The numbers 4 + j3 
and 4 − j3 are conjugates. Note that whereas in the real 
plane, a point is represented by a coordinate pair (x, y), 
the point is represented in the complex plane as a com-
plex number, for example, 4 + j3.
The rectangular form of the presentation is very con-
venient for addition or subtraction of complex num-
bers, since the real parts and the imaginary parts can 
be added, or subtracted, separately. It is not the most 
convenient, however, for operations such as multiplica-
tion or division. For such purposes, the polar form is 
preferred. This is similar to the polar coordinates used in 
the real plane, but with one important feature that will 
be discussed shortly.
In polar form, a complex number is represented as a 
line, of length equal to the magnitude of the complex 
number, drawn from the origin at a certain angle with 
respect to the horizontal axis. In the polar form, therefore,

two parameters are specified: a magnitude and a phase 
angle. A complex number p may be represented in polar 
form as p Ð °
q , where |p| is the magnitude of the com-
plex number and θ is its phase angle (Figure D.2). The 
positive direction of angles is counterclockwise from 
the real axis, and the nagative direction is clockwise.
The conversion between rectangular and polar forms 
follows readily from Figure D.2. Given the rectangular 
form p = a + jb, it follows that

It can be readily verified that the complex numbers

­following representations in polar form:

Figure D.2 also shows the conjugate of p in polar form. 
It has the same magnitude as p and a phase angle that is 
the negative of that of p.
The polar form of a complex number can also be repre-
sented in a very useful form that is not applicable to the 
polar form of real quantities. It follows from Equation 
D.4 that

But according to Equation D.2: e

which is known as Euler’s formula. Hence, a complex 
number X may be represented in polar form as
	
p

(D.6)
Note that e jq is a complex number in polar form 
whose magnitude is unity and whose phase angle is θ. 
Hence, a complex number whose phase angle is θ may 
be represented as in Equation D.6. In particular, j
e
j

p

so the polar form of an imaginary number such as j2 
is a line 2 units in length that lies along the imaginary 
axis.
D.3  Addition and Subtraction
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are easy 
to perform in rectangular form. If p = a + jb and q = c + jd, 
then

(D.7)
In other words, the real and imaginary parts are 
added, or subtracted, separately. Hence, if the numbers 
are given in polar form, it may be easier to convert them 
first to rectangular form, add or subtract them, and con-
vert again to polar form, if desired. For example, if

That is, the sum of a complex number and its conju-
gate is a real number equal to twice the real part of the 
number. The difference between a complex number and 
its conjugate is an imaginary number equal to twice the 
imaginary component of the minuend, that is, the num-
ber being subtracted from.
Addition and subtraction in polar form essentially fol-
low the same procedure. To add p and q in Figure D.3, 
the parallelogram construction is followed. Suppose

In other words, when two complex numbers are mul-
tiplied together, the product has a magnitude that is 
equal to the products of the magnitudes of the two num-
bers and a phase angle equal to the sum of their phase 
angles. This is illustrated in Figure D.4a.

Thus, when two complex numbers are divided by 
one another, the quotient has a magnitude that is equal 
to the quotient of the magnitudes of the two numbers 
and a phase angle equal to the difference of their phase 
angles. This is illustrated in Figure D.4b.

An important special case is multiplication and divi-
sion by j. Since j

j
=

2, multiplication by j is equivalent 
to increasing the phase angle by 90°, that is, rotating 
the line representing the complex number by 90° in the 
counterclockwise direction. Similarly, division by j is 
equivalent to decreasing the phase angle by 90°, that is, 
rotating the line representing the complex number by 
90° in the clockwise direction.

multiplying a complex number by its conjugate gives a 
real number equal to the square of the magnitude of the

D.5  Raising to a Power
A complex number in polar form can be raised to a 
power k, where k is a real number:
	
p
p e
p e
k
j
k
k
jk
= éë
ùû =
q
q
	
(D.17)
In general, to raise a complex number to a real power k, 
its magnitude is raised to the power k and its phase angle 
is multiplied by k. For example, if p= Ð
°
4 30 , p2
16 60
=
Ð
°, 
and 
p- =
Ð -
°
2
1
16
60 .
However, if k is a positive integer less than unity, 
then this is tantamount to taking the root of a com-
plex number, and care must be taken to include all 
the roots. Suppose, for example, that p =
Ð
°
125 75  and 
k = 1/5. Then the angle 75° will have to be divided by 5. 
However, in polar form the angle θ of a complex number 
is really θ + 2πn, where n is any integer. When θ + 2πn is 
divided by 5, with n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, the result is an angle 
between 0° and 360°. This is as it should be, for taking 
the fifth root should give five, nonrepeating roots. The 
five values of n do indeed give these five roots. Each root 
will have a magnitude of 125
5

of p =

The five roots are plotted in Figure D.5. Since they

(E.5)
The method of solving a system of linear simultane-
ous equations by means of determinants is known as 
Cramer’s rule.
The solutions given by Equation E.4 are derived 
according to the following rules:
Step 1: The expression for each variable is the ratio 
of two determinants. The determinant in the 
denominator is always Δ, the determinant of the 
set of equations as defined by Equation (E.2). The 
determinant in the numerator of x1 is obtained 
by replacing the coefficients of the first column 
in Δ, that is, the coefficients of x1 in the equations, 
by the column representing the B’s. Similarly, the 
determinant in the numerator of x2 is obtained by 
replacing the coefficients of the second column 
in Δ, that is, the coefficients of x2 in the equations, 
by the column representing the B’s.
Step 2: Each determinant expands to the expres-
sion given by:

(E.6)
Each product term in the expansion of the deter-
minant is obtained by multiplying each element 
in a given column or a given row by its minor, 
with the appropriate sign. The minor of a given 
element is what remains after deleting the row 
and the column in which the element occurs. 
For example, consider the determinant Δ. The 
minor of a11 is a22, which is what remains after 
deleting the first column and the first row, in 
which a11 occurs. Similarly, the minor of a12 is 
a21, the minor of a21 is a12, and the minor of a22 
is a11. Considering the product terms a11a22 and 
a12a21 in the expression for Δ, it will be noted 
that they are obtained by going through any one 

794	
Appendix E: Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations
column of the determinant, or any one row, and 
multiplying each element by its minor. Thus, 
if we go through the first column, multiplying 
a11 by its minor gives a11a22, and multiplying 
a21 by its minor gives a12a21. Alternatively, we 
may go through the elements of the first row. 
Again, multiplying a11 by its minor gives a11a22, 
and multiplying a12 by its minor gives a12a21. 
Similarly, we could have gone through the ele-
ments of the second column or the second row.
For a 2 × 2 determinant, the previous procedure 
reduces to the difference of the product of the 
elements in two diagonals: the first diagonal is 
that descending from the top leftmost element, 
whereas the second diagonal is that ascending 
from the bottom leftmost element.
It can be readily verified that the same procedure 
applies for evaluating the terms in the expres-
sions for the first two determinants in Equation 
E.6. It remains to determine the signs of the terms 
in the expansions of the determinants.
The signs of the minors of each element are 
obtained from a checkerboard pattern of alter-
nating plus and minus signs in the determinant 
Δ, starting with a plus sign in the upper left-
hand position. Thus, for the 2 × 2 determinant 
under consideration, the signs are
	
+
-
-
+ 	
(E.7)
In other words, the minors of a11 and a22 have posi-
tive signs, whereas the minors of a12 and a21 have 
negative signs. It can be readily verified that the 
determinant expansions in Equation E.6 con-
form to this sign convention.
The signed minor of a given element is referred to 
as the cofactor of that element.
E.3  Solution for Three Linear 
Simultaneous Equations
The procedure outlined earlier can be extended to a sys-
tem of linear simultaneous equation of any order. We 
will consider first the solution for three linear simul-
taneous equations, because a simplified procedure 
is applicable in this case. Let the three equations be

Each of the four determinants may be evaluated 
according to the procedure of Step 2 of the preceding

term is the product of the two elements in the smaller diag-
onal below the main diagonal and the element in the upper 
right-hand corner. The third term is the product of the ele-
ment in the lower left-hand corner and the two elements in 
the smaller diagonal above the main diagonal. The nega-
tive terms are obtained in an analogous manner but pro-
ceeding upwards, as shown in the diagram on the right.

E.4  Evaluation of Determinants 
of Higher Order
The procedure indicated in (E.15) does not apply to 
determinants of order higher than 3. An alternative pro-
cedure, known as pivotal condensation, may be used to 
successively reduce the order of the determinant until 
it is a 3 × 3 or a 2 × 2 determinant and can be evaluated 
by the methods presented earlier.
The method of pivotal condensation may be illus-
trated by the 3 × 3 determinant Δ in Example E.1:

a number of 2 × 2 determinants, where the first determi-
nant in the first row is

the original determinant to be condensed. The result is 
a determinant of order n − 1. This procedure is further 
illustrated by Example E.2.

E.5  Use of MATLAB
As the previous example illustrates, solving a system of 
more than three linear simultaneous equations is rather 
tedious. Fortunately, advanced calculators have the 
­feature of solving such equations as does MATLAB.
To see how linear simultaneous equations may be 
solved using MATLAB, we note that Equations E.1 may 
be written in matrix notation as
	
AX
B
=
	
(E.21)
where
A is an n × n matrix of the aij coefficients
X is a column matrix of the variables x1, x2, …, xn
B is a column matrix of the B’s
To solve for X we premultiply both sides of Equation 
E.21 by A−1, the inverse matrix of A, where A−1A = 1. 
Equation E.21 becomes
	
X
A B
=
-1 	
(E.22)
The procedure for solving the system of equations 
using MATLAB is as follows:
Step 1: Enter the numerical matrices A and B.
Step 2: Evaluate the product A–1B; an alternative 
command is A\B.
Step 3: Read off the values of the variables as the 
­elements of the resulting column matrix.
This procedure is illustrated in Example E.3 by solv-
ing the simultaneous equation of Example E.2 using 
MATLAB.

equations:

Solution:
At the MATLAB prompt, enter the matrix of aij coeffi-
cients as follows:
	
 ≫A = éë
ùû
2 1 3 4 1 2 1 3 5 1 1 3 2 3 4 1
, , , ; , , , ; , , , ; , , ,
	

Appendix E: Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations	
797
Note that a matrix is entered between square brackets. 
Elements in a row are separated by commas, whereas 
rows are separated by semicolons. After an entry is 
made, MATLAB displays the entry for checking pur-
poses. At the next prompt enter the matrix B:
	
≫B = éë
ùû
9 5 10 1
; ;
;
	
Alternatively, B may be entered as
	
≫B = éë
ùû¢
9 5 10 1
, ,
,
	
Here, the elements are separated by commas, so the 
matrix entered, without the apostrophe, is a row matrix. 
The apostrophe transposes the row matrix to a column 
matrix. At the next prompt enter
	
≫A B
\ 	
MATLAB displays the column matrix X
[ ]:
  1.0000
−1.0000
−0.0000
  2.0000
where the elements of this matrix are x1 to x4, respectively.
MATLAB can also be used to handle complex quanti-
ties and to evaluate determinants. If matrix A has been 
entered as indicated earlier, entering det(A) causes 
MATLAB to display 121, the value of the determinant as 
determined earlier.
E.6  Properties of Determinants
The following properties of determinants are stated 
without proof:
Property 1. If all the rows of a determinant are changed 
into columns or if all the columns are changed into rows, 
the determinant does not change.
Example: 
	
2
4
3

-
-
-
=
-
-
-
=
	
Here, the first, second, and third rows of the first 
determinant have become the first, second, and third 
columns of the second determinant, respectively.
Property 2. If any two rows, or any two columns, of a 
determinant are interchanged, the sign of the determi-
nant is changed, without affecting its value.
Example:

-
-
-
;
	
where the first and third rows of the first determinant 
are interchanged in the second determinant, and the 
second and third columns of the first determinant are 
interchanged in the third determinant.
Property 3. If all the elements in a row (or in a column) 
are multiplied by a constant, the determinant is multi-
plied by the same constant.

Property 4. A determinant is unaltered if a multiple of 
the elements of a row are added to another row, or if 
a multiple of the elements of a column are added to 
another column.
Example:

Property 5. If the elements in one row are proportional 
to those of another row, or if the elements in one column 
are proportional to those of another column, the deter-
minant is zero.

As a special case, if any two rows, or any two col-
umns, of a determinant are identical, the determinant 
is zero. The corresponding simultaneous equations are 
not independent.
Property 6. If all the elements of one row (or of one 
­column) can be expressed as sums of two quantities, 
the determinant can be expressed as the sum of two 
determinants in which the other rows (or columns) are 
the same.

Property 7. If all the elements of one row (or of one column)

elements of another row (or another column) and the 
results are added, their sum is zero.

The elements of the first row have been multiplied 
by the cofactors of the corresponding elements of the

dance with the checkerboard pattern of (E.11).
