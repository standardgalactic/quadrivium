Preface
Most of mathematics is concerned at some level with setting up 
and solving various types of equations. Algebraic geometry is the 
mathematical discipline which handles solution sets of systems of 
polynomial equations. These are called algebraic sets.
Making use of a correspondence which relates algebraic sets to 
ideals in polynomial rings, problems concerning the geometry of 
algebraic sets can be translated into algebra. As a consequence, 
algebraic geometers have developed a multitude of often highly 
abstract techniques for the qualitative and quantitative study of 
algebraic sets, without, in the rst instance, considering the equa­
tions. Modern computer algebra algorithms, on the other hand, 
allow us to manipulate the equations and, thus, to study explicit 
examples. In this way, algebraic geometry becomes accessible to 
experiments. The experimental method, which has proven to be 
highly successful in number theory, is now also added to the tool­
box of the algebraic geometer.
In these notes, we discuss some of the basic operations in ge­
ometry and describe their counterparts in algebra. We explain 
how the operations can be carried through using computer alge­
bra methods, and give a number of explicit examples, worked out 
with the computer algebra system Singular. In this way, our 
book may serve as a rst introduction to Singular, guiding the 
reader to performing his own experiments.
In detail, we proceed along the following lines:
Chapter 0 contains remarks on computer algebra systems in 
iii

general and just a few examples of what can be computed in dif­
ferent application areas.
In Chapter 1, we focus on the geometry{algebra dictionary, il­
lustrating its entries by including a number of Singular exam­
ples.
Chapter 2 contains a discussion of the algorithms involved and 
gives a more thorough introduction to Singular.
For the fun of it, in Chapter 3, we show how to nd the solu­
tion of a well{posed Sudoku by solving a corresponding system of 
polynomial equations.
Finally, in Chapter 4, we discuss a particular classication prob­
lem in group theory, and explain how a combination of theory and 
explicit computations has led to a solution of the problem. Here, 
algorithmic methods from group theory, number theory, and al­
gebraic geometry are involved.
Due to the expository character of these notes, proofs are only 
included occasionally. For all other proofs, references are given.
For a set of Exercises, see
http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/ pfister/Exercises.pdf.
The notes grew out of a course we taught at the African Insti­
tute for the Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in Cape Town, South 
Africa. Teaching at AIMS was a wonderful experience and we 
would like to thank all the students for their enthusiasm and the 
fun we had together. We very much appreciated the facilities at 
AIMS and we are grateful to its sta for constant support.
We thank Oliver Labs for contributing the illustrations along 
with hints on improving the text, Christian Eder and Stefan Stei- 
del for reading parts of the manuscript and making helpful sug­
gestions, and Petra Basell for typesetting the notes.

General Remarks on Computer Algebra 
Systems
Computer algebra algorithms allow us to compute in and with 
a multitude of mathematical structures. Accordingly, there is a 
large number of computer algebra systems suiting dierent needs. 
There are general purpose and special purpose computer algebra 
systems. Some well{known general purpose systems are commer­
cial, whereas many of the special purpose systems are open{source 
and can be downloaded from the internet for free. General pur­
pose systems aim at providing basic functionality for a variety of 
dierent application areas. In addition to tools for symbolic com­
putation, they usually oer tools for numeric computation and for 
visualization.
Example 0.1 Maple is a commercial general purpose system. In 
showing a few of its commands at work, we start with examples 
from calculus, namely denite and indenite integration:
> int(sin(x), x = 0 .. Pi);
2
> int(x/(x~2-1), x);
1/2 ln(x - 1) + 1/2 ln(x + 1)
For linear algebra applications, we rst load the corresponding 
package. Then we demonstrate how to perform Gaussian elimi­
nation and how to compute eigenvalues, respectively.

A := Matrix([[2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 1], [0, 1, 2]]);

Next, we give an example of numerical solvingy:

-1.334383488, 0., 5.929222024
Finally, we show one of the graphic functions at work:
> plot3d(x*exp(-x'2-y'2),x = -2 .. 2,y = -2 .. 2,grid = [49, 49]);
For applications in research, general purpose systems are often 
not powerful enough: The implementation of the required basic 
algorithms may not be optimal with respect to speed and storage 
handling, and more advanced algorithms may not be implemented
y Note that only the real roots are computed.

at all. Many special purpose systems have been created by people 
working in a eld other than computer algebra and having a des­
perate need for computing power in the context of some of their 
research problems. A pioneering and prominent example is Velt- 
man's Schoonship which helped to win a Nobel price in physics 
in 1999 (awarded to Veltman and t'Hooft 'for having placed par­
ticle physics theory on a rmer mathematical foundation').
Example 0.2 GAP is a free open{source system for computa­
tional discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computa­
tional Group Theory. In the following GAP session, we dene a 
subgroup G of the symmetric group S11 (the group of permuta­
tions of f1; : : :; 11g) by giving two generators in cycley notation. 
We check that G is simple (that is, its only normal subgroups 
are the trivial subgroup and the whole group itself). Then we 
compute the order jGj of G, and factorize this number:
gap> G := Group([(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11),(3,7,11,8)(4,10,5,6)]); 
Group([(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11), (3,7,11,8)(4,10,5,6)])
gap> IsSimple(G);
true
gap> size := Size(G);
7920
gap> Factors(size);
[ 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 11 ]
From the factors, we see that G has a Sylow 2{subgroupz of order 
24 = 16. We use GAP to nd such a group P :
gap> P := SylowSubgroup(G, 2);
Group([(2,8)(3,4)(5,6)(10,11), (3,5)(4,6)(7,9)(10,11), 
(2,4,8,3)(5,10,6,11)])
Making use of the Small Groups Library included in GAP, we 
check that, up to isomorphism, there are 14 groups of order 16, 
and that P is the 8th group of order 16 listed in this library:
y The cycle (4,10,5,6), for instance, maps 4 to 10, 10 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 4, and 
any other number to itself.
z If G is a nite group, and p is a prime divisor of its order jGj, then a 
subgroup U of G is called a Sylow p{subgroup if its order jUj is the highest 
power of p dividing jGj.

General Remarks on Computer Algebra Systems
gap> SmallGroupsInformation(16);
There are 14 groups of order 16.
They are sorted by their ranks.
1 is cyclic.
2 - 9 have rank 2.
10 - 13 have rank 3.
14 is elementary abelian.
gap> IdGroup( P ); 
[ 16, 8 ]
Now, we determine what group P is. First, we check that P is 
neither Abelian nor the dihedral group of order 16 (the dihedral 
group of order 2n is the symmetry group of the regular n{gon):
gap> IsAbelian(P);
false
gap> IsDihedralGroup(P);
false
Further information on P is obtained by studying the subgroups 
of P of order 8. In fact, we consider the third such subgroup 
returned by GAP and name it H:
gap> H := SubgroupsOfIndexTwo(P)[3];
Group([(2,3,11,5,8,4,10,6)(7,9), (2,4,11,6,8,3,10,5)(7,9), 
(2,5,10,3,8,6,11,4)(7,9), (2,6,10,4,8,5,11,3)(7,9)])
gap> IdGroup(H);
[ 8, 1 ]
gap> IsCyclic(H);
true
Thus, H is the cyclic group C8 of order 8 (cyclic groups are gen­
erated by just one element). Further checks show, in fact, that 
P is a semidirect product of C8 and the cyclic group C2 . See 
[Wild (2005)] for the classication of groups of order 16.
Remark 0.3 The group G studied in the previous example is 
known as the Mathieu group M11. We should point out that 
researchers in group and representation theory have created quite 
a number of useful electronic libraries such as the Small Groups 
Library considered above.

Example 0.4 Magma is a commercial system focussing on al­
gebra, number theory, geometry and combinatorics. We use it to 
factorize the 8th Fermat number:

Next, we meet our rst example of an algebraic set: In Weierstra 
normal form, an elliptic curve over a eld K is a nonsingulary 
curve in the xy{plane dened by one polynomial equation of type
y2 + aixy + a3y — x3 — a2x2 — a4x — a6j = 0;
with coecients ai 2 K . In the following Magma session, we 
dene an elliptic curve E in Weierstra normal form over the 
nite eld F with 590 elements by specifying the coecients ai .
Then we count the number of points on E with coordinates in F .
F := FiniteField(5,90);
E := EllipticCurve([Zero(F),Zero(F),One(F),-One(F),Zero(F)]);
E;

The signicance of elliptic curves stems from the fact that they 
carry an (additive) group law. Having specied a base point (the 
zero element of the group), the addition of points is dened by a 
geometric construction involving secant and tangent lines. For el­
liptic curves in Weierstra normal form, it is convenient to choose 
the unique point at innity of the curve as the base point (see 
Section 1.2.1 for points at innity and Example 0.6 below for a 
demonstration of the group law).
Remark 0.5 Elliptic curves, most notably elliptic curves dened 
over Q respectively over a nite eld, are of particular impor­
tance in number theory. They take center stage in the conjecture 
of [Birch and Swinnerton{Dyer (1965)] z, they are key ingredients
y Informally, a curve is nonsingular if it admits a unique tangent line at each 
of its points. See, for instance, [Silverman (2009)] for a formal denition 
and for more information on elliptic curves.
z The Birch and Swinnerton{Dyer conjecture asserts, in particular, that an 
elliptic curve E over Q has an innite number of points with rational co­
ordinates i its associated L{series satises L(E; 1) = 0.

General Remarks on Computer Algebra Systems
in the proof of Fermat's last theorem [Wiles (1995)], they are im­
portant for integer factorization [Lenstra (1987)], and they nd 
applications in cryptography [Koblitz (1987)]. As with other awe­
some conjectures in number theory, the Birch and Swinnerton{ 
Dyer conjecture is based on computer experiments.
Example 0.6 Sage is a free open{source mathematics software 
system which combines the power of many existing open{source 
packages into a common Python{based interface. To show it at 
work, we start as in Example 0.1 with computations from calculus. 
Then, we compute all prime numbers between two given numbers.

Finally, we dene an elliptic curve E in Weierstra normal form 
over Q and demonstrate the group law on this curve. The rep­
resentation of the results takes innity into account in the sense 
that the points are given by their homogeneous coordinates in the 
projective plane (see Section 1.2 for the pro jective setting). In 
particular, (0 : 1 : 0) denotes the unique point at innity of the 
curve which is chosen to be the zero element of the group.

General Remarks on Computer Algebra Systems

Among the systems combined by Sage are Maxima, a general 
purpose system which is free and open{source, GAP, the system 
introduced in Example 0.2, PARI/GP, a system for number the­
ory, and Singular, the system featured in these notes.
Singular 4
Singular is a free open{source system for polynomial computa­
tions, with special emphasis on commutative and noncommuta- 
tive algebra, algebraic geometry, and singularity theory. As most 
other systems, Singular consists of a precompiled kernel, written 
in C/C++, and additional packages, called libraries and written 
in the C{like Singular user language. This language is inter­
preted on runtime. Singular binaries are available for most 
common hardware and software platforms. Its release versions 
can be downloaded through ftp from
ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/
or via your favourite webbrowser from Singular's webpage
http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/ .
Singular also provides an extensive online manual and help func­
tion. See its webpage or enter help; in a Singular session.
Most algorithms implemented in Singular rely on the basic 
task of computing Grobner bases. Grobner bases are special sets 
of generators for ideals in polynomial rings. Their denition and 
computation is sub ject to the choice of a monomial ordering such 
as the lexicographical ordering >lp and the degree reverse lexico­
graphical ordering >dp. We will treat Grobner bases and their 
computation by Buchberger's algorithm in Chapter 2. Singular 
examples, however, will already be presented beforehand.

8 General Remarks on Computer Algebra Systems
Singular Example 0.7 We enter the polynomials of the system
x + y + z — 1 
= 0
x2 + y2 + z2 -1 = 0
x3 + y3 + z3 — 1 = 0
in a Singular session. For this, we rst have to dene the cor­
responding polynomial ring which is named R and endowed with 
the lexicographical ordering. Note that the 0 in the denition of 
R refers to the prime eld of characteristic zero, that is, to Q.
> ring R = 0, (x,y,z), lp;
> poly f1 = x+y+z-1;
> poly f2 = x2+y2+z2-1;
> poly f3 = x3+y3+z3-1;
Next, we dene the ideal generated by the polynomials and com­
pute a Grobner basis for this ideal (the system given by the 
Grobner basis elements has the same solutions as the original sys­
tem).
> ideal I = f1, f2, f3;
> ideal GI = groebner(I); GI;
GI[1]=z3-z2
GI[2]=y2+yz-y+z2-z
GI[3]=x+y+z-1
In the rst equation of the new system, the variables x and y 
are eliminated. In the second equation, x is eliminated. As a 
consequence, the solutions can, now, be directly read o:
(1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (0; 0; 1):
The example indicates that >lp is what we will call an elimination 
ordering. If such an ordering is chosen, Buchberger's algorithm 
generalizes Gaussian elimination. For most applications of the 
algorithm, however, the elimination property is not needed. It is, 
then, usually more ecient to choose the ordering >dp.
Multivariate polynomial factorization is another basic task on 
which some of the more advanced algorithms in Singular rely. 
Starting with the rst computer algebra systems in the 1960's, the 
design of algorithms for polynomial factorization has always been 
an active area of research. To keep the size of our notes within 

General Remarks on Computer Algebra Systems

reasonable limits, we will not treat this here. We should point 
out, however, that algorithms for polynomial factorization do not 
depend on monomial orderings. Nevertheless, choosing such an 
ordering is always part of a ring denition in Singular.
Singular Example 0.8 We factorize a polynomial in Q[x; y; z] 
using the Singular command factorize. The resulting output 
is a list, showing as a rst entry the factors, and as a second entry 
the corresponding multiplicities.

Remark 0.9 In recent years, quite a number of the more ab­
stract concepts in algebraic geometry have been made construc­
tive. They are, thus, not only easier to understand, but also acces­
sible to computer algebra methods. A prominent example is the 
desingularization theorem of Hironaka (see [Hironaka (1964)]) for 
which Hironaka received the Fields Medal. In fact, Villamajor's 
constructive version of Hironaka's proof has led to an algorithm 
whose Singular implementation allows us to resolve singulari­
ties in many cases of interest (see [Bierstone and Milman (1997)], 
[FruhbiS{Kruger and Pfister (2006)], [Bravo et al. (2005)]).
When studying plane curves or surfaces in 3{space, it is often 
desirable to visualize the geometric ob jects under consideration. 
Excellent tools for this are Surf and its descendants Surfexy and 
Surferz. Comparing Surfex and Surfer, we should note that 
Surfex has more features, whereas Surfer is easier to handle.

10 General Remarks on Computer Algebra Systems
Example 0.10 The following Surfer picture shows a surface in 
3{space found by Oliver Labs using Singular:
Singular Example 0.11 We set up the equation of Labs' surface 
in Singular. The equation is dened over a nite extension eld 
of Q which we implement by entering its minimal polynomial:
> ring R = (0,a), (x,y,w,z), dp;
> minpoly = a~3 + a + 1/7;
> poly a(1) = -12/7*a~2 
- 384/49*a - 8/7;
> poly a(2) = -32/7*a~2 
+ 24/49*a 
- 4;
> poly a(3) =

> poly a(4) = -8/7*a~2

> poly a(5) =

> poly P = x*(x~6-3*7*x~4*y~2+5*7*x~2*y~4-7*y~6)

> poly S = P-(z+a(5)*w)*C~2;
> homog(S); // returns 1 if poly is homogeneous 
1

7
We see that S is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 7. It denes 
Labs' surface in projective 3{space. This surface is a 'world record' 
surface in that it has the maximal number of nodes known for 
a degree{7 surface in projective 3{space (a node constitutes the 

General Remarks on Computer Algebra Systems 11
most simple type of a singularity). We use Singular to conrm 
that there are precisely 99 nodes (and no other singularities).
First, we compute the dimension of the locus of singularities 
via the Jacobian criterion (see [Decker and Schreyer (2013)] for 
the criterion and Sections 1.1.8 and 2.3 for more on dimension): 
> dim(groebner(jacob(S)))-1;
0
The result means that there are only nitely many singularities. 
By checking that the nonnodal locus is empty, we verify that all 
singularities are nodes. Then, we compute the number of nodes: 
> dim(groebner(minor(jacob(jacob(S)),2))) - 1;
-1
> mult(groebner(jacob(S)));
99
Singular Example 0.12 If properly installed, Surf, Surfex, 
and Surfer can be called from Singular. To give an example, 
we use Surfer to plot a surface which, as it turns out, resembles 
a citrus. To begin, we load the Singular library connecting to 
Surf and Surfer.

The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
In this chapter, we will explore the correspondence between alge­
braic sets in ane and pro jective space and ideals in polynomial 
rings. More details and all proofs not given here can be found in 
[Decker and Schreyer (2013)]. We will work over a eld K, and 
write K[x1 ;:::;xn] for the polynomial ring over K in n variables. 
All rings considered are commutative with identity element 1.
1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
Our discussion of the geometry{algebra dictionary starts with Hil­
bert's basis theorem which is the fundamental result about ideals 
in polynomial rings. Then, focusing on the ane case, we present 
some of the basic ideas of algebraic geometry, with particular em­
phasis on computational aspects.
1.1.1 Ideals in Polynomial Rings
To begin, let R be any ring.
Denition 1.1 A subset I R is called an ideal of R if the 
following holds:
(i) 0 2I.
(ii) Iff;g2I, thenf+g2I.
(iii) If f 2 R and g 2 I, then f g 2 I.
12

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
13
Example 1.2
(i) If ; 6= T R is any subset, then all R{linear combinations 
g1f1 + 
+ grfr, with g1;::::gr 2 R and f1;:::;fr 2 T,
form an ideal of R, written hTiR or hTi, and called the ideal 
generated by T . We also say that T is a set of gener­
ators for the ideal. If T = ff1 ; : : : ; frg is nite, we write 
hT i = hf1 ; : : : ; fri. We say that an ideal is nitely gen­
erated if it admits a nite set of generators. A principal 
ideal can be generated by just one element.
(ii) If fI g is a family of ideals of R, then the intersection I 
is also an ideal of R.
(iii) The sum of a family of ideals fIg of R, written 
I, is
the ideal generated by the union I.
Now, we turn to R = K[x1;:::;xn].
Theorem 1.3 (Hilbert's Basis Theorem) Every ideal of the 
polynomial ring K[x1;:::;xn] is nitely generated.
Starting with Hilbert's original proof [Hilbert (1890)], quite a 
number of proofs for the basis theorem have been given (see, for 
instance, [Greuel and Pster (2007)] for a brief proof found in the 
1970s). A proof which nicely ts with the spirit of these notes is 
due to Gordan [Gordan (1899)]. Though the name Grobner bases 
was coined much later by Buchbergery, it is Gordan's paper in 
which these bases make their rst appearance. In fact, Gordan 
already exhibits the key idea behind Grobner bases which is to 
reduce problems concerning arbitrary ideals in polynomial rings 
to problems concerning monomial ideals. The latter problems are 
usually much easier.
Denition 1.4 A monomial in x1;:::;xn is a product x = 
x11 xnn ; where = (1;:::;n) 2 Nn. A monomial ideal of 
K[x1;:::;xn] is an ideal generated by monomials.
y Grobner was Buchberger's thesis advisor. In his thesis, Buchberger devel­
oped his algorithm for computing Grobner bases. See [Buchberger (1965)].

The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
The rst step in Gordan's proof of the basis theorem is to show 
that monomial ideals are nitely generated (somewhat mistakenly, 
this result is often assigned to Dickson):
Lemma 1.5 (Dickson's Lemma) Let ; 6= A Nn be a subset 
of multi{indices, and let I be the ideal I = hx j 2 Ai. Then 
there exist (1);:::;(r) 2 A such that I = hx(1) ;:::;x(r) i.
Proof We do induction on n, the number of variables. If n = 1, 
let (1) := minf j 2 Ag. Then I = hx(1) i. Now, let n > 1 and 
assume that the lemma holds for n — 1. Given a = (a, an) 2 Nn, 
with a = (a1;..:; on 1) 2 N" 1, we write xa = x“1 ■ ■ ■ x“n^1.
Let A = fa 2 N" 1 j (a; i) 2 A for some ig, and let J = 
hfxa}^eAi C K[x1;:::; xn 1 ]. By the induction hypothesis, there 
exist multi{indices 
(1) = ( (1) ; "(1)); : : : ; (s) = ( (s) ; 
"(s)) 2 A
such that J = hx" ;:::;x i. Let ' = maxfft"")}. 
For i =
j
0;:::;', let Ai = {a 2 N" 1 j (a, i) 2 A} and Ji = hfxa}_2Aii C 
K[x1 . ....xn 1 ]. Using once more the induction hypothesis, we

((si); i) A h tht J
get i 
= (i ; i); : : : ; i 
= (i ; i) 2 A such that Ji =
hxi() ; : : : ; x(isi ) i. Let
B = •[ {A(1);:::;A(S’ 
i=0
Then, by construction, every monomial x; a 2 A, is divisible by 
a monomial x; 2 B. Hence, I = hfx }2B i.
In Corollary 2.28, we will follow Gordan and use Grobner bases 
to deduce the basis theorem from the special case treated above.
Theorem 1.6 Let R be a ring. The following are equivalent:
(i) Every ideal of R is nitely generated.
(ii) (Ascending Chain Condition) Every chain

of ideals of R is eventually stationary. That is,
Ik = Ik+1 = Ik+2 = : : : for some k 1:

Denition 1.7 A ring satisfying the equivalent conditions above 
is called a Noetherian ring.
Finally, we introduce the following terminology for later use:
Denition 1.8 We say that an ideal I of R is a proper ideal 
if I 6= R. A proper ideal p of R is a prime ideal if f; g 2 R 
and fg 2 p implies f 2 p or g 2 p. A proper ideal m of R is a 
maximal ideal if there is no ideal I of R such that m ( I ( R.
1.1.2 Ane Algebraic Sets
Following the usual habit of algebraic geometers, we write An (K) 
instead of Kn : The ane n{space over K is the set
An(K) = (a1;:::;an) j a1;:::;an 2 K :
Each polynomial f 2 K[x1; : : : ; xn] denes a function
f : An(K) !K; (a1;:::;an) 7!f(a1;:::;an);
which is called a polynomial function on An(K). Viewing f as 
a function allows us to talk about the zeros of f . More generally, 
we dene:
Denition 1.9 If T 
K[x1 ;:::;xn] is any set of polynomials,
its vanishing locus (or locus of zeros) in An (K) is the set
V(T) =fp2An(K) j f(p) =0for allf2Tg:
Every such set is called an ane algebraic set.
It is clear that V(T ) coincides with the vanishing locus of the ideal 
hTi generated by T . Consequently, every algebraic set A in An (K) 
is of type V(I) for some ideal I of K [x1; : : : ; xn]. By Hilbert's ba­
sis theorem, A is the vanishing locus V(f1;:::;fr) = ir=1 V(fi) 
of a set of nitely many polynomials f1; : : : ; fr. Referring to the 
vanishing locus of a single nonconstant polynomial as a hyper­
surface in An(K), this means that a subset of An(K) is algebraic 
i it can be written as the intersection of nitely many hypersur­
faces. Hypersurfaces in A2 (K) are called plane curves.

Example 1.10 We choose K = R so that we can draw pictures.
(i) Nondegenerate conics (ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas) are 
well{known examples of plane curves. They are dened by 
degreed equations such as x2 + y2 — 1 = 0.
(ii) As discussed in Example 0.4, elliptic plane curves are de­
ned by degree{3 equations. Here is the real picture of the 
elliptic curve from Example 0.6:

In addition to showing the curve in the ane plane, we also 
present a 'spherical picture' of the projective closure of the

(v) Labs' septic from Example 0.10 is a hypersurface in 3{

The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
Depending on a parameter , the equation of the Kummer 
surface is of type
(x2 + y2 + z2 - y2)2 - A yo yi y2 ys = 0;
where the yi are the tetrahedral coordinates
y0 = 1 — z \/2x; 
y1 = 1 — z + a/2x;
y2 = 1 + z + p2y, 
ys = 1 + z - p2y,
and where A =

secting the hypersurfaces V(y — x2) and V(xy — z):

Taking vanishing loci denes a map V which sends sets of poly­
nomials to algebraic sets. We summarize the properties of V:
Proposition 1.11
(i) 
The map V reverses inclusions: If I J are subsets of 
K[x1;: : : ;xn], then V(I) 
V(J).
(ii) Ane space and the empty set are algebraic:
V(0) = An (K); 
V(1) = ;:
(iii) 
The union of nitely many algebraic sets is algebraic: If
I1 ; : : : ; Is are ideals of K [x1 ; : : : ; xn], then

(iv) The intersection of any family of algebraic sets is algebraic: 
If fIg is a family of ideals of K[x1;:::;xn], then
\ V(I) = V X I
(v) A single point is algebraic: If a1 ; : : : ; an 2 K, then
V(X1 - ai; : : : ;Xn ~ an ) = f^ ; : : : ; «„ ^:
Proof All properties except (iii) are immediate from the deni­
tions. For (iii), by induction, it suces to treat the case of two 
ideals I; J K[x1; : : : ; xn]. Let I J be the ideal generated by 
all products f g, with f 2 I and g 2 J. Then, as is easy to see, 
V(I) [ V(J) = V(I J) and V(I) [ V(J) V(I \ J) V(IJ) 
(the second inclusion holds since I J I \ J). The result follows.
□
Remark 1.12
(i) Properties (ii){(iv) above mean that the algebraic subsets 
of An (K) are the closed sets of a topology on An (K), which 
is called the Zariski topology on An(K).
(ii) If A An (K) is any subset, the intersection of all algebraic 
sets containing A is the smallest algebraic set containing A. 
We denote this set by A. In terms of the Zariski topology, 
A is the closure of A.
(iii) If A An (K) is any subset, the Zariski topology on An (K) 
induces a topology on A, which is called the Zariski topol­
ogy on A.
(iv) Topological notions such as open, closed, dense, or neigh­
borhood will always refer to the Zariski topology.
Along with treating the geometry{algebra dictionary, we will state 
some computational problems for ideals in polynomial rings aris­
ing from its entries. These problems are not meant to be attacked 
by the reader. They rather serve as a motivation for the com­
putational tools developed in Chapter 2, where we will present 
algorithms to solve the problems. Explicit Singular examples 
based on the algorithms, however, will already be presented in 
this chapter.

Problem 1.13 Give an algorithm to compute ideal intersections.
Singular Example 1.14
>

> 
ideal I = z; ideal J = x,y;
> 
ideal K = intersect(I,J); K;
K[1]=yz
K[2]=xz
So V(z) [ V(x; y) = V(hzi \ hx; yi) = V(xz; yz).
Remark 1.15 The previous example is special in that we con­
sider ideals which are monomial. The intersection of monomial 
ideals is obtained using a simple recipe: Given I = hm1;:::;mri 
and J = hm01;:::;m0si in K[x1;:::;xn], with monomial genera­
tors mi and m0j , the intersection I \ J is generated by the least 
common multiples lcm(mi; m0j). In particular, I \ J is monomial 
again. See Section 2.2.4 for the general algorithm.
Our next step in relating algebraic sets to ideals is to dene some 
kind of inverse to the map V:
Denition 1.16 If A 
An(K) is any subset, the ideal
I(A) := ff 2K[x1;:::;xn] jf(p) = 0 for all p2Ag
is called the vanishing ideal of A.
We summarize the properties of I and start relating I to V:
Proposition 1.17 Let R = K[x1;:::;xn].
(i) I(;) = R. If K is innite, then I(An (K)) = h0i.
(ii) If A B are subsets of An (K), then I(A) I(B).

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
21
(iii) If A; B are subsets of An(K), then
I(A[B) = I(A) \ I(B):
(iv) For any subset A An (K), we have
V(I(A)) =A:
(v) For any subset I 
R, we have
I(V(I)) 
I:
Proof Properties (ii), (iii), and (v) are easy consequences of the 
denitions. The rst statement in (i) is also clear. For the second 
statement in (i), let K be innite, and let f 2 K[x1;:::;xn] be 
any nonzero polynomial. We have to show that there is a point 
p 2 An (K) such that f(p) 6= 0. By our assumption on K, this is 
clear for n = 1 since every nonzero polynomial in one variable has 
at most nitely many zeros. If n > 1, write f in the form f = 
co(xi; : : : ,X"-1) + C1 (x 1;. . . ;Xn-1 ) X n + ■ ■ ■ + Cs (xi ;■■■ ,xn-1 )xsn ■ 
Then ci is nonzero for at least one i. For such an i, we may 
assume by induction that there is a point p0 2 A" 1 (K) such that 
ci(p0) = 0. Then f(p',xn) 2 K[xn] is nonzero. Hence, there is 
an element a 2 K such that f(p',a) = 0. This proves (i). For 
(iv), note that V(I(A)) A. Let, now, V(T) be any algebraic set 
containing A. Then f(p) = 0 for all f 2 T and all p 2 A. Hence, 
T I(A) and, thus, V(T) V(I(A)), as desired.
Property (iv) above expresses V(I(A)) in terms of A. Likewise, 
we wish to express I(V(I)) in terms of I. The following example 
shows that the containment I(V(I)) I may be strict.
Example 1.18 We have
I(V(xk )) = hxi for all k 1.
Denition 1.19 Let R be any ring, and let I R be an ideal. 
Then the set
pI := ff 2 R j fk 2 I for some k 
1g
is an ideal of R containing I . It is called the radical of I . If 
I = I, then I is called a radical ideal.

phfi=hf1fsi:
The product f1 fs, which is uniquely determined by f up to 
multiplication by a constant, is called the square{free part of 
f. If f = f1 fs up to scalar, we say that f is square{free.

1.1.3 Hilbert's Nul lstel lensatz
It is clear from the denitions that I(V(I)) 
I. But even this
containment may be strict:
Example 1.23 The polynomial 1 + x2 2 R[x] has no real root. 
Hence, considering the ideal of the real vanishing locus, we get
I(V(1 + x2)) = I(;) = R[x]:
Here, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, we may remedy 
the situation by allowing complex roots as well. More generally, 
given any eld K , we may work over the algebraic closure K of K . 
Then, by the very denition of K , every nonconstant polynomial 
in one variable has a root. This fact has a multivariate analogue:

linear combination of dierent monomials, with nonzero scalars. 
Then f 2 I i the respective monomials are contained in I. See 
Section 2.2.1 for the general algorithm.
Now, we discuss a second version of the Nullstellensatz which 
settles our question of how to express I(V(I)) in terms of I:

24
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
Theorem 1.29 (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, Strong Version) 
Let K = K, and let I 
K[x1;:::;xn] be an ideal. Then
I(V(I)) =pI:
Proof As already said earlier, I I(V(I)). For the reverse 
inclusion, let f 2 I(V(I)), and let f1;:::;fr be generators for I. 
Then f vanishes on V(I), and we have to show that fk = g1f1 +
+grfr for some k 
1 and some g1;:::;gr 2 K[x1;:::;xn] =: R.
We use the trick of Rabinowitch : Consider the ideal
J := hf1 ;:::;fr ; 1 - tf) C R[t],
where t is an extra variable. We show that V(J) An+1 (K) is 
empty. Suppose on the contrary that p = (a1; : : : ; an; an+1) 2 
V(J) is a point, and set p0 = (a1; : : : ; an). Then f1 (p0) = 
=
fr (p0) = 0, so that p0 2 V(I), and an+1f(p0) = 1. This contradicts 
the fact that f vanishes on V(I).
From the weak Nullstellensatz, we conclude that 1 2 J . Then 
we have 1 = r= r=1 hifi + h(1 — tf) for suitable hi,..., hr ,h 2 
R[t]. Substituting 1=f for t in this expression and multiplying 
by a suciently high power f k to clear denominators, we get a 
representation fk = ir=1 gifi as desired.

As we will see more clearly in Section 2.2.3, the trick of Rabinow-

f 2 Pl O 1 2 J := hl; 1 - tf i C K [X1 ;:::;Xn;t];
where t is an extra variable.
Based on the Nullstellensatz, we can express geometric properties 
in terms of ideals. Here is a rst example of how this works:

25
Proposition 1.32 Let K be any eld, and let I

(ii) For each i, 1 i

Problem 1.33 Design a test for checking whether (ii) holds.
In Section 1.1.6, we will see that (ii) holds i the quotient ring 
K[x1;:::;xn]=I is nite{dimensional as a K {vector space. How 
to compute the vector space dimension is a topic of Section 2.3.
Example 1.34 Taking the symmetry of the generators into ac­
count, the computation in Example 0.7 shows that the ideal

A3 (R) is

Theorem 1.40 Every nonempty algebraic set A An (K) can be 
expressed as a nite union
A = V1 [[Vs
of subvarieties Vi . This decomposition can be chosen to be mini­
mal in the sense that Vi 6 Vj for i 6= j . The Vi are, then, uniquely 
determined and are called the irreducible components of A.
Proof The main idea of the proof is to use Noetherian induc­
tion: Assuming that there is an algebraic set A An(K) which 
cannot be written as a nite union of irreducible subsets, we get 
an innite descending chain of subvarieties Vi of A:

This contradicts the ascending chain condition in the polynomial 
ring since taking vanishing ideals is inclusion reversing.

Problem 1.41 Design an algorithm to nd the irreducible com­

The algebraic concept of primary decomposition, together with 
algorithms for computing such decompositions, gives an answer 
to both Problems 1.41 and 1.37. See Section 2.4.
If K is a subeld of C, and if all irreducible components in 
An (C) are points (that is, we face a system of polynomial equa­
tions with just nitely many complex solutions), we may nd the 
solutions via triangular decomposition . This method combines 
lexicographic Grobner bases with univariate numerical solving.

1.1.5 Removing Algebraic Sets
The set theoretic dierence of two algebraic sets need not be an 
algebraic set:
Example 1.43 Consider again the union of the xy{plane and 
the z{axis in A3 (R):

28
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
Removing the plane, the residual set is the punctured z{axis, 
which is not dened by polynomial equations. Indeed, if a poly­
nomial f 2 R[x; y; z] vanishes on the z{axis except possibly at 
the origin o, then the univariate polynomial g(t) := f (0; 0; t) has 
innitely many roots since R is innite. Hence, g = 0 (see the 
proof of Proposition 1.17), so that f vanishes at o, too.
In what follows, we explain how to nd polynomial equations for 
the Zariski closure of the dierence of two algebraic sets, that is, 
for the smallest algebraic set containing the dierence. We need:
Denition 1.44 Let I; J be two ideals of a ring R. Then the sets
I : J :=ff2Rjfg2Ifor allg2Jg 
and
I : J1:= ff 2RjfJk 
I for some k 
1g= [1(I : Jk)
k=1
are ideals of R containing I . They are called the ideal quotient 
of I by J and the saturation of I with respect to J, respectively.
Problem 1.45 Design algorithms to compute ideal quotients and 
saturation.
Since the polynomial ring K[x1;:::;xn] is Noetherian by Hilbert's 
basis theorem, and since I : Jk = (I : Jk~1) : J for any two ideals 
I;J K[x1;:::;xn], the computation of I : J1 just means to 
iterate the computation of ideal quotients: The ascending chain
I : J I : J2 I : Jk
is eventually stationary. How to compute ideal quotients will be 
discussed in Section 2.2.5.

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry 
29
Theorem 1.46 Let I;J be ideals of K[x1;:::;xn]. Then, consid­
ering vanishing loci and the Zariski closure in An(K), we have
V(I) n V(J) =V(I : J1) 
An(K):
If I is a radical ideal, then
V(I) nV(J) = V(I : J) 
An(K):
The theorem is another consequence of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
See [Decker and Schreyer (2013)].
Singular Example 1.47 We illustrate the geometry of ideal 
quotients by starting from an ideal I which denes the intersection 
of the curve C = V(y — (x — 1)3(x — 2)) C A2 (R) with the x-axis:
> 
ring R = 0, (x,y), dp;
> 
ideal I = y-(x-1)~3*(x-2), y;
>

>

_[2]=x-1
_[3]=x-2
[2]:

There are two intersection points, namely p = (0; 1) and q = (0; 2). 
The ideal J = h(x — 1)(x — 2)i defines a pair of parallel lines which 
intersect the x-axis in p and q , respectively. We compute the ideal 
quotient I1 = I : J:

30

> 
ideal J = (x-1)*(x-2);
> 
ideal I1 = quotient(I,J); I1;

I1[2]=x2-2x+1
> 
factorize(I1[2]);
[1]:
_[1]=1
_[2]=x-1
[2]:
1,2
The resulting ideal I1 denes the intersection of the parabola C1 =
V(y— (x—1)2) with the x axis which consists of the point p = (0; 1) 
only. In fact, the x{axis is the tangent to C1 at p:
Computing the ideal quotient I2 = I1 : J, we may think of the 
result as dening the intersection of a line with the x{axis at p:
> 
ideal I2 = quotient(I1,J); I2;
I2[1]=y
I2[2]=x-1
A nal division also removes p:
> 
ideal I3 = quotient(I2,J); I3; 
I3[1]=1

1.1.6 Polynomial Maps
Since algebraic sets are dened by polynomials, it should not be 
a surprise that the maps relating algebraic sets to each other are 
dened by polynomials as well:
Denition 1.49 Let A An(K) and B Am(K) be (nonempty) 
algebraic sets. A map ' : A ! B is called a polynomial map, or 
a morphism, if there are polynomials f1;:::;fm 2 K[x1 ;:::;xn] 
such that '(p) = (f1 (p);:::;fm(p)) for all p 2 A.
In other words, a map A ! B is a polynomial map i its com­
ponents are restrictions of polynomial functions on An (K) to A. 
Every such restriction is called a polynomial function on A.
Given two polynomial functions p 7! f (p) and p 7! g(p) on A, 
we may dene their sum and product according to the addition 
and multiplication in K: send p to f(p) + g(p) and to f(p) g(p), 
respectively. In this way, the set of all polynomial functions on 
A becomes a ring, which we denote by K [A]. Since this ring is 
generated by the coordinate functions p 7! xi (p), we dene:
Denition 1.50 Let A An (K) be a (nonempty) algebraic set. 
The coordinate ring of A is the ring of polynomial functions 
K [A] dened above.
Note that K may be considered as the subring of K[A] consisting 
of the constant functions. Hence, K [A] is naturally a K {algebra. 
Next, observe that each morphism ' : A ! B of algebraic sets 
gives rise to a homomorphism
': K[B] ! K[A]; g 7! g';
of K {algebras. Conversely, given any homomorphism : K [B] ! 
K [A] of K {algebras, one can show that there is a unique polyno­
mial map ' : A ! B such that = '. Furthermore, dening the 
notion of an isomorphism as usual by requiring that there exists 
an inverse morphism, it turns out that ' : A ! B is an isomor­
phism of algebraic sets i ' is an isomorphism of K {algebras.

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
33
Example 1.51 Let C = V(y — x2 ,xy — z) C A3(R) be the twisted 
cubic curve. The map
A1(R) !C; t 7! (t;t2;t3);
is an isomorphism with inverse map (x; y; z) 7! x.
By relating algebraic sets to rings, we start a new section in the 
geometry{algebraic dictionary. To connect this section to the pre­
vious sections, where we related algebraic sets to ideals, we recall 
the denition of a quotient ring:
Denition 1.52 Let R be a ring, and let I be an ideal of R. 
Two elements f; g 2 R are said to be congruent modulo I if 
f — g 2 I. In this way, we get an equivalence relation on R. We 
write f = f + I for the equivalence class of f 2 R, and call it the 
residue class of f modulo I. The set R=I of all residue classes 
becomes a ring, with algebraic operations
f +g = f +g and fg = fg:
We call R=I the quotient ring of R modulo I.
Now, returning to the coordinate ring of an ane algebraic set 
A, we note that two polynomials f; g 2 K[x1 ; : : : ; xn] dene the 
same polynomial function on A i their dierence is contained in 
the vanishing ideal I(A). We may, thus, identify K [A] with the 
quotient ring K[x1 ; :::; xn]=I(A), and translate geometric proper­
ties expressed in terms of I(A) into properties expressed in terms 
of K [A]. For example:
A is irreducible () I(A) is prime () K[x1 ; : : : ; xn]=I(A) is 
an integral domain.
For another example, let I C K[x1 ; :::; xn] be any ideal. Then, 
as one can show, Proposition 1.32 can be rewritten as follows:
The vanishing locus V(I) of I in An(K) is nite () the K{ 
vector space K[x1 ; :::; xn]=I is nite{dimensional.
Denition 1.53 A ring of type K[x1 ; :::; xn]=I, where I is an 
ideal of K[x1 ; :::; xn], is called an ane K{algebra, or simply 
an ane ring.

34
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
With regard to computational aspects, we should point out that 
it were calculations in ane rings which led Buchberger to design 
his Grobner basis algorithm. In fact, to implement the arithmetic 
operations in K[x1 ;:::;xn]=I, we may x a monomial ordering > 
on K[x1;:::;xn], represent each residue class by a normal form 
with respect to > and I , and add and multiply residue classes by 
adding and multiplying normal forms. Computing normal forms, 
in turn, amounts to compute remainders on multivariate polyno­
mial division by the elements of a Grobner basis for I with respect 
to >. See Algorithm 1 and Proposition 2.27 in Chapter 2.
Singular Example 1.54
> ring R = 0, (z,y,x), lp;
> ideal I = y-x2, z-xy;
> qring S = groebner(I); // defining a quotient ring

_[2]=z-yx
> poly f = x3z2-4y4z+x4;
> reduce(f,groebner(0)); // division with remainder 
-4x11+x9+x4
Closely related to normal forms is a result of Macaulay which was a 
major motivation for Buchberger and his thesis advisor Grobner. 
Together with Buchberger's algorithm, this result allows one to 
nd explicit K {vector space bases for ane rings K[x1 ;:::;xn]=I 
(and, thus, to determine the vector space dimension). In fact, as 
in Gordan's proof of the basis theorem, one can use Grobner bases 
to reduce the case of an arbitrary ideal I to that of a monomial 
ideal (see Theorem 2.55 for a precise statement).
Singular Example 1.55 In Example 0.7, we computed a lexico­
graphic Grobner basis GI for the ideal
I = hx + y + z - 1; x2 + y2 + z2 - 1; x3 + y3 + z3 - 1)
Q[x; y; z]:

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
35
By inspecting the elements of GI, we saw that the system dened 
by the three generators of I has precisely the three solutions
(1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (0; 0; 1)
in A3 (Q). In particular, there are only nitely many solutions. 
As said earlier in this section, this means that the Q{vector space 
Q[x; y; z]=I has nite dimension. We check this using Singular:
> vdim(GI); // requires Groebner basis 
6
In general, if nite, the dimension d = dimK(K[x1;:::;xn]=I) is 
an upper bound for the number of points in the vanishing locus of 
I in An (K). In fact, given a point p 2 V(I) An (K), there is a 
natural way of assigning a multiplicity to the pair (p; I). Counted 
with multiplicity, there are exactly d solutions. See Section 1.1.9.
1.1.7 The Geometry of Elimination
The image of an ane algebraic set under a morphism need not 
be an algebraic setyz:
Example 1.56 The projection map (x; y) 7! y sends the hyper­
bola V(xy — 1) onto the punctured y{axis:
In what follows, we show how to obtain polynomial equations for 
the Zariski closure of the image of a morphism. We begin by 
considering the special case of a projection map as in the example 
above. For this, we use the following notation:
y We may, however, represent the image as a constructible set. See 
[Kemper (2007)] for an algorithmic approach.
z In projective algebraic geometry, morphisms are better behaved.

36
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
Denition 1.57 Given an ideal I 
K[x1;:::;xn] and an integer
0 k n, the kth elimination ideal of I is the ideal
Ik = I \ K[xk+1;:::;xn]:
Note that I0 = I and that In is an ideal of K .
Remark 1.58 As indicated earlier, one way of nding Ik is to 
compute a Grobner basis of I with respect to an elimination or­
dering for x1 ; : : : ; xk . Note that >lp has the elimination property 
for each set of initial variables: If G is a Grobner basis of I with 
respect to >lp on K[x1;:::;xn], then G \ K[xk+1;:::; xn] is a 
Grobner basis of Ik with respect to >lp on K[xk+1;... ;xn], for 
k = 0;:::; n — 1. See Section 2.2.2 for details.
Theorem 1.59 Let I 
K[x1 ; : : : ; xn] be an ideal, let A = V(I)
be its vanishing locus in An (K), let 0 < k < n — 1, and let
%k : An(K) ! An~k (K); (X1 ,...,Xn ) ! (X^ ; : : : ; X n) ;
be projection onto the last n — k components. Then
MA) = V(Ik) C An-k(K):
Proof As we will explain in Section 2.5 on Buchberger's algorithm 
and eld extensions, the ideal generated by Ik in the polynomial 
ring K [Xk+1 ; : : : ; ; Xn] is the rst elimination ideal of the ideal 
generated by I in K[X1 ; : : : ; ; Xn]. We may, hence, suppose that 
K = K. The theorem is, then, an easy consequence of the Null- 
stellensatz. We leave the details to the reader.
In what follows, we write X = fX1 ; : : : ; Xn g and y = fy1 ; : : : ; ymg, 
and consider the Xi and yj as the coordinate functions on An (K) 
and Am (K), respectively. Moreover, if I C K [X] is an ideal, we 
write IK[X; y] for the ideal generated by I in K [X; y].
Corollary 1.60 With notation as above, let I C K[X] be an ideal, 
let A = V(I) be its vanishing locus in An (K), and let
':A!Am(K); p! (f1(p);:::; fm(p));

be a morphism, given by polynomials f1; : : : ; fm 2 K [x]. Let J be 
the ideal
J = IK [x; y] + hfi - yi ,...,fm - ym i C K [x, y]:
Then
'(A) = V(J \ K[y]) C Am (K).
That is, the vanishing locus of the elimination ideal J \ K[y] in 
Am (K) is the Zariski closure of '(A).
Proof The result follows from Theorem 1.59 since the ideal J 
describes the graph of ' in An+m (K).
Remark 1.61 Algebraically, as we will see in Section 2.2.6, the 
ideal J \ K [y] is the kernel of the ring homomorphism
: K[y1;. . . ;ym] ! S = K[x1;. . . ; xn]=I; yi 7! fi = fi + I.
Recall that the elements f1 ; . . . ; fm are called algebraically in­
dependent over K if this kernel is zero.
Under an additional assumption, the statement of Corollary 1.60 
holds in the geometric setting over the original eld K :
Corollary 1.62 Let I; f1 ; . . . ; fm, and J be as in Corollary 1.60, 
let A = V(I) C An(K), and let
':A!Am(K); p7!(f1(p);...;fm(p));
be the morphism dened by f1 ; . . . ; fm over K . Suppose that 
the vanishing locus of I in An (K) is the Zariski closure of A in 
An(K). Then
'(A) = V(J \ K[y]) C Am (K).
If K is innite, then the condition on A in Corollary 1.62 is fullled 
for A = An(K). It, hence, applies in the following Example:
Singular Example 1.63 We compute the Zariski closure B of 
the image of the map
' : A2 (R) ! A3 (R); (s; t) 7! (st; t; s2).

The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
According to the discussion above, this means to create the rele­
vant ideal J and to compute a Grobner basis of J with respect to a 
monomial ordering such as >lp. Here is how to do it in Singular: 
> ring RR = 0, (s,t,x,y,z), lp;
> ideal J = x-st, y-t, z-s2;
> groebner(J);
_[1]=x2-y2z
_[2]=t-y
_[3]=sy-x
_[4]=sx-yz
_[5]=s2-z
The rst polynomial is the only polynomial in which both vari­
ables s and t are eliminated. Hence, the desired algebraic set is 
B = V(x2 — y2z). This surface is known as the Whitney umbrella:
V(x2 — y2z)
Alternatively, we may use the built{in Singular command 
eliminate to compute the equation of the Whitney umbrella:
> ideal H = eliminate(J,st);
> H;
H[1]=y2z-x2
For further Singular computations involving an ideal obtained 
by eliminating variables, it is usually convenient to work in a ring 
which only depends on the variables still regarded. One way of 
accomplishing this is to make use of the imap command:
> ring R = 0, (x,y,z), dp;
> ideal H = imap(RR,H); // maps the ideal H from RR to R
> H;
H[1]=y2z-x2

The map ' above is an example of a polynomial parametriza­
tion:
Denition 1.64 Let B Am (K) be algebraic. A polynomial 
parametrization of B is a morphism ' : An (K) ! Am (K) such 
that B is the Zariski closure of the image of '.
Instead of just considering polynomial maps, we are more gener­
ally interested in rational maps, that is, in maps of type 
t = (t1;:::;tn) 7!
g1 (t) ; : : : ; gm (t) ; 
h1 (t) 
hm (t)
with polynomials gi; hi 2 K[x1;:::;xn] (see Example 1.10, (iv)). 
Note that such a map may not be dened on all of An (K) because 
of the denominators. We have, however, a well{dened map
nm 
g1(t) 
gm(t)
':An(K)nV(h1hm)!Am(K); t7! h1(t);:::;hm(t) :
Our next result will allow us to compute the Zariski closure of the 
image of such a map:
Proposition 1.65 Let K be innite. Given gi; hi 2 K[x] = 
K[x1;:::;xn], i = 1;:::;m, consider the map
': U ! Am(K); t7! g1(t);:::; gm (t) ; 
h1 (t) 
hm (t)
where U = An (K) n V(h1 hm). Let J be the ideal
J = hhiyi - g1; : : :;hmym ~ gm; 1 - hl • • • hm ■ wi C K [W;X;y];
where y stands for the coordinate functions y1 ; : : : ; ym on Am (K), 
and where w is an extra variable. Then
'(U) = V(J \ K[y]) C Am(K):
Singular Example 1.66 We demonstrate the use of Proposition 
1.65 in an example:
> ring RR = 0, (w,t,x,y), dp;
> poly g1 = 2t; poly h1 = t2+1;
> poly g2 = t2-1; poly h2 = t2+1;

does not admit a polynomial parametrization.

1.1.8 Noether Normalization and Dimension
We know from the previous section that the image of an algebraic 
set under a projection map need not be an algebraic set:
Under an additional assumption, projections are better behaved:
Theorem 1.68 (Projection Theorem) Let I be a nonzero ideal 
of K[x1;:::;xn], n 2, and let I1 = I \ K[x2;:::;xn] be its rst 
elimination ideal. Suppose that I contains a polynomial f1 which 
is monic in x1 of some degree d 1:
fl = Xd + C1 (X2 ; : : : ;Xn 
+--------+ Cd ^2 ; : - ^n
with coecients ci 2 K [x2 ; : : : ; xn]. Let
^1 : An (K) ! An”1 (K); (X1 ; . . . ;Xn ) ! (X2 ; : : -,Xn );
be projection onto the last n — 1 components, and let A =V(I) C 
An(K). Then
%1 (A)=V(I1) C An"1 (K).
In particular, 1 (A) is an algebraic set.

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
41
Proof Clearly 1 (A) V(I1). For the reverse inclusion, taking 
Section 2.5 on Buchberger's algorithm and eld extensions into 
account as in the proof of Theorem 1.59, we may assume that 
K = K. Let, then, p0 2 A" 1 (K) \ %1 (A) be any point. To 
conclude that p0 2 A" 1 (K) \ V(I1), we have to find a polynomial 
g 2 I1 such that g (p0) 6= 0.
We claim that every polynomial f 2 K[x1 ; : : :; xn] has a rep­
Pi
resentation f = gj gjxj + h, with polynomials g0.....gd 1 2 
j=0
K[x2;:::; xn] and h 2 I, and such that gj- (p0) = 0, j = 0,..., d—1. 
Once this is established, we apply it to 1,xi,..., xd-1 to get 
representations

with polynomials gij 2 K[x2 , . . . , xn] and hi 2 I, and such that 
ij (p0) = 0, for all i,j. Writing Ed for the d d identity matrix, 
this reads

Setting g := det(Ed — (gij)) 2 K[x2;... ;xn], Cramer's rule gives 
where B is the adjoint matrix of (Ed — (gij)). In particular, from 
the first row, we getg 2 I and, thus, g 2 Ii . Furthermore, 
(p0) = 1 since gij (p0) = 0 for all i, j. We conclude that p0 2
An-1 (K) \ V(I1), as desired.
To prove the claim, consider the map
: K[x1,. . . ,xn] ! K[x1], f 7! f(x1,p0).
Since any element a 2 V((I)) would give us a point (a, p0) 2 A, 

42
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
a contradiction to p0 2= 1 (A), we must have V((I)) = ;. This 
implies that (I) = K[x1] (otherwise, being a principal ideal, (I) 
would have a nonconstant generator which necessarily would have 
a root in K = K). Hence, given f 2 K[x1;:::;xn], there exists a 
polynomial f 2 I such that $(f) = ^(f). Set f := f — f. Then 
fb (x1 ; p0) = 0. Since the polynomial f1 is monic in x1 of degree d, 
division with remainder in K[x2;:::;xn][x1] yields an expression
d-1
fb= qf1 + 
gj xj1;
i=0
with polynomials gj 2 K[x2;:::;xn]. Since fb(x1; p0) = 0, we have 
P. - 
j
q(x1; p0)f1(x1; p0)+ 
gj 
(p0)x1 = 0. Now, since f1(x1; p0) 2 K[x1]
j=0
has degree d, the uniqueness of division with remainder in K[x1] 
implies that gj(p0) = 0, j = 0,:::, d — 1. Setting h := f + qf1, we 
d-1
have h 2 I and f = gj xj1 + h. This proves the claim.

A crucial step towards proving the Nullstellensatz is the following 
lemma which states that the additional assumption of the pro jec- 
tion theorem can be achieved by a coordinate change : K [x] ! 
K[x] of type x1 7! x1 and xi 7! xi + gi (x1), i 2, which can be 
taken linear if K is innite:
Lemma 1.69 Let f 2 K[x1; : : : ; xn] be nonconstant. If K is 
innite, let a2 ; : : : ; an 2 K be suciently general. Substituting 
xi + aix1 for xi in f, i = 2; : : : ; n, we get a polynomial of type
axd + C1(X2 ; : : : ;Xn)Xd^Y + : : : + 0^2 ,: : :
where a 2 K is nonzero, d 
1, and each ci 2 K [x2 ; : : : ; xn]. If K
is arbitrary, we get a polynomial of the same type by substituting 
i—1
xi + xr1 
for xi , i = 2; : : : ; n, where r 2 N is suciently large.
Example 1.70 Substituting y + x for y in xy — 1, we get the 
polynomial x2 + xy — 1, which is monic in x. The hyperbola 
V(x2 + xy — 1) projects onto A1(K) via (x, y) ! y:

Inverting the coordinate change, we see that the original hyper­
bola V(xy — 1) projects onto A1 (K) via (x, y) ! y — x.

that the coordinates are chosen such that each nonzero elimination 
ideal Ik-1 = I \ K[xk,..., xn], k = 1,..., n, contains a monic
Now, we use the projection theorem to prove the Nullstellensatz:
Proof of the Nullstellensatz, Weak Version. Let I be an 
ideal of K[x1; :::; xn]. If 1 2 I, then V(I) An (K) is clearly 
empty. Conversely, suppose that 1 2= I . We have to show that 
V(I) An (K) is nonempty. This is clear if n = 1 or I = 
h0i. Otherwise, apply a coordinate change as in Lemma 1.69 
to a nonconstant polynomial f 2 I. Then (f) is monic in 
x1 as required by the projection theorem (adjust the noncon­
stant leading coecient in x1 to 1, if needed). Since 1 2= I, 
also 1 2= (I) \ K[x2 ; : : : ; xn]. Inductively, we may assume that 
V(^(I) \K[x2;::: ,xn]) C An 1 (K) contains a point. By the pro­
jection theorem, this point is the image of a point in V((I)) via 
(x1 ; x2; : : : ; xn) ! (x2; : : : ; xn). In particular, V((I)) and, thus, 
V(I) are nonempty.
Remark 1.71 Let h0i 6= I ( K[x1 ; : : : ; xn] be an ideal. Succes­
sively carrying out the induction step in the proof above, applying 
Lemma 1.69 at each stage, we may suppose after a lower triangular

then ak must be among the nitely many roots of the polynomial

Remark 1.72 Given an ideal I as above and any set of coor­
dinates x1 , ...,xn, let G be a Grobner basis of I with respect 
to the lexicographic ordering >lp. Then, as will be clear from 
the denition of >lp in Section 2.1, there are monic polynomials 
fk 2 K [xk+1 , : : : , xn][xk] as above i such polynomials are among 
the elements of G (up to nonzero scalar factors). Furthermore, as 
already said in Remark 1.58, the ideal Ik 1 is zero iff no element 
of G involves only xk , : : : , xn .
Singular Example 1.73 Consider the twisted cubic curve C = 
V(y — x2 ,xy — z) C A3 (C). Computing a lexicographic Grobner 
basis for the ideal hy — X2 ,xy — z), we get:

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
45
Here, no coordinate change is needed: The last Grobner basis 
element x2 — y is monic in x, the first one y3 — z2 monic in y. 
Moreover, the other Grobner basis elements depend on all vari­
ables x; y; z, so that I2 = h0i. Hence, C is projected onto the 
curve C1 = V(y3 — z2) in the yz{plane, and C1 is projected onto 
the z{axis which is a copy of A1 (C). The following picture shows 
the real points:
Intuitively, having a composition of projection maps
v = ~ ■ o • • • o K1 : A = V(I) ! An-c(K)
which is surjective with finite fibers, the number d = n — c should 
be the dimension of A:
(if c = n in Remark 1.71, the dimension d of A should be zero). To 
make this a formal definition, one needs to show that the number 
d does not depend on the choice of the projection maps. This 
is more conveniently done on the algebraic side, using the ring 
theoretic analogue of Remark 1.71.
We need some terminology: If R is a subring of a ring S , we 
say that R S is a ring extension. More generally, if R ! S 

46
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
is any injective ring homomorphism, we identify R with its image 
in S and consider, thus, R S as a ring extension.
With this terminology, the algebraic counterpart of the pro jec- 
tion map 1 : V(I) ! V(I1) is the ring extension
R = K[x2;:::;xn]=I1 
S = K[x1;:::;xn]=I
which is induced by the inclusion K[x2;;:::;xn] K[x1;:::;xn]. 
We may, then, rephrase the additional assumption of the pro jec- 
tion theorem by saying that the element x1 = x1 +I 2 S is integral 
over R in the following sense:
Denition 1.74 Let R S be a ring extension. An element s 2 S 
is integral over R if it satises a monic polynomial equation
sd + ri sd 1 + ■ ■ ■ + rd = 0; with all ri 2 R:
The equation is, then, called an integral equation for s over R. 
If every element s 2 S is integral over R, we say that S is integral 
over R, or that R S is an integral extension.
Remark 1.75 Let R S be a ring extension.
(i) If s1 ; : : : ; sm 2 S are integral over R, then R[s1 ; : : : ; sm] is 
integral over R.
(ii) Let S T be another ring extension. If T is integral over 
S , and S is integral over R, then T is integral over R.
In the situation of the projection theorem, the extension
R = K[x2; : : : ; xn]=I1 
S = K[x1; : : : ; xn]=I
is integral since S = R[x1] and x1 is integral over R.
Example 1.76 The extension
K[y] ! K[x;y]=hx2 + xy - li
is integral while
K[y] ! K[x;y]=hxy - 1i
is not. Can the reader see why?

Problem 1.77 Design an algorithm for checking whether a given 
extension of ane rings is integral.
See Section 2.2.7 for an answer to this problem.
Returning to Remark 1.71, we now compose the algebraic coun­
terparts of the projection maps k . Taking the second part of 
Remark 1.75 into account, we obtain the ring theoretic analogue 
of Remark 1.71:
Theorem 1.78 Given an ane ring S = K[x1;:::;xn]=I 6= 0, 
there are elements y1;:::;yd 2 S such that:
(i) y1;:::;yd are algebraically independent over K.
(ii) K[y1;:::;yd] 
S is an integral ring extension.
If y1 ; : : : ; yd satisfy conditions (i) and (ii), the inclusion
K[y1;:::;yd] 
S
is called a Noether normalization for S .
This includes the case d = 0 in which the assertion means that S 
is a nite{dimensional K {vector space.
Problem 1.79 Design an algorithm to nd a Noether normaliza­
tion for a given ane ring.
In principle, a solution to this problem has already been given 
in Remark 1.72: Combine randomly chosen lower triangular co­
ordinate changes with lexicographic Grobner basis computations. 
The resulting algorithm will be presented in Section 2.2.8.
Singular Example 1.80 For the coordinate ring of the hyper­
bola V(xy — 1), Singular finds a coordinate change similar to 
the one we found in Example 1.70:
> ring R = 0, (x,y), dp;
> ideal I = xy-1;
> LIB "algebra.lib";
> noetherNormal(I); // will implicitly use lp

48
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
The result means that the map
K[y] —K K[x;y]=h4x2 + xy - li 
constitutes a Noether normalization. Hence,
K[y - 4x] C K[x; y]=(xy - li
is a Noether normalization. See also Example 2.48. 
We can, now, give the denition of dimension:
Denition 1.81 Let I ( K[x1; :::; xn] be a proper ideal, and let 
A = V(I) be its vanishing locus in An (K). If
K[y1;:::;yd] C K[x1;:::;xn]=I
is a Noether normalization, we dene d to be the dimension of 
A, written
dim(A) = d:
Theorem 1.82 The denition is independent of the choices made.
In principle, we can compute the dimension by computing a 
Noether normalization.
Singular Example 1.83 As expected, the dimension of the twis­
ted cubic curve is l (see Example l.73), while that of the Whitney 
umbrella is 2:
> ring R = 0, (x,y,z), dp;
> ideal I = x2-y2z;

_[2]=3x+y

Combining randomly chosen coordinate changes with lexicographic 
Grobner basis computations to compute the dimension via a Noether 
normalization can be very slow.

Problem 1.84 Design a fast algorithm for computing dimension.
Being based on a Noether normalization
K[y1;:::;yd] 
K[x1;:::;xn]=I;
our denition of the dimension of an algebraic set A = V(I) 
An (K) is algebraic in nature. In fact, we may as well say that d 
is the dimension of the ane ring K[x1;:::;xn]=I. The notion 
of Krull dimension allows us to assign a dimension to any ring:
Denition 1.85 Let R 6= 0 be a ring. A sequence
p0 (p1 (:::(pm
of prime ideals of R with strict inclusions is called a chain of 
prime ideals of R of length m. The Krull dimension of R, 
written dim(R), is the supremum of the lengths of such chains. If 
I ( R is an ideal, the Krul l dimension of I, written dim(I), is 
dened to be the dimension of R=I .
For ane rings, we have, now, two notions of dimension. Using 
a rened version of the Noether normalization theorem, one can 
show that these notions agree.
Remark 1.86 According to what we said above, a proper ideal 
I ( K[x1;:::;xn] is zero{dimensional i K[x1;:::;xn]=I is a 
nite{dimensional K {vector space. Recall from Section 1.1.6 that 
this means that the vanishing locus of I in An (K) is nite.
We will treat the computation of dimension in Section 2.3.
1.1.9 Local Studies
In the previous sections, we focused on the geometry of an alge­
braic set considered in its entirety. Rather than taking this global 
point of view, however, one is often interested in examining the 
behaviour of an algebraic set "near\ one of its points.
This local point of view will, for example, be taken when den- 
ing multiplicities of solutions in the sense discussed at the end 
of Section 1.1.6. A particular example where multiplicities occur 
is the classical theorem of Bezout. Given two plane curves C; D 

50
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
dened by squarefree polynomials of degrees d; e without a com­
mon factor, the theorem states that C and D meet in d e points, 
provided we work in the right setting, and provided we count the 
intersection points with multiplicities.
Working in the right setting means that we consider the curves 
in the projective plane over an algebraically closed eld (we will 
treat projective spaces in Section 1.2.1). The intersection multi­
plicities, on the other hand, account for tangency:
The degree of tangency can be measured from a dynamical point of 
view: Slightly perturb the equations dening the curves and count 
the intersection points occuring near the point under examination:
A less intuitive but much more practical approach to local studies 
in general and intersection multiplicites in particular comes from 
algebra. We briey explore this in what follows. To simplify our 
notation, we suppose that the point under consideration is the 
origin o = (0;:::;0) of An(K). The case of an arbitrary point 
p = (a1;:::;an) 2 An(K) can be dealt with by translating p to 
o (send xi to xi — ai for all i). When dealing with solutions over 

1.1 Ane Algebraic Geometry
51
K , this requires that we extend K by adjoining each coordinate 
ai not contained in K .
Polynomial functions are dened on all of An(K). Locally 
near o, in addition to the polynomial functions, we may con­
sider functions obtained by inverting polynomial functions: If 
f 2 K[x1;:::;xn] is not vanishing at o, the function q 7! 1=f (q) 
is dened on the Zariski open neighborhood An (K) n V(f) of o in 
An(K). Algebraically, this leads us to enlarge K[x1 ;:::;xn] by 
considering the ring extension K[x1;:::;xn] Oo, where Oo is 
the ring of fractions
g;h 2 K[x1;:::;xn];h(o) 6= 0 
K(x1;:::;xn):
Here, as usual, K(x1 ;:::;xn) denotes the eld of rational func­
tions in x1 ; : : : ; xn with coecients in K . In particular, we think 
of g=h as an equivalence class under the equivalence relation given 
by (g; h) (g0;h0) () gh0 = hg0.
Denition 1.87 Let I ( K[x1 ;:::;xn] be a proper ideal, and 
let A be the vanishing locus of I in An (K). Suppose that p 2 A 
is an isolated point of A. That is, there is a Zariski open 
neighborhood of p in An (K) containing no other points of A. The 
multiplicity of p as a solution of I, written mult (p j I), is 
dened as follows: If p = o is the origin, set
mult (o j I) = dimK (Oo=IOo)
(here, IOo denotes the ideal generated by I in Oo). If p is dierent 
from o, translate p to o, extending K if needed, and apply the 
recipe above over the extended eld.
Our nal remark in Section 1.1.6 on counting solutions with multi­
plicities can now be made precise (see [Cox et al. (2005), Theorem 
4.2.2] for a proof):
Proposition 1.88 With notation as in Denition 1.87, suppose 
that A is nite (then each point of A is an isolated point of A).

52 
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
The following holds:
dimK(K[x1;:::;xn]=I) = 
mult (pj I):
Example 1.89 If I is the ideal
I = hx + y + z — 1; x2 + y2 + z2 — 1; x3 + y3 + z3 — 1)
Q[x; y; z];
then Q[x; y; z]=I is a Q{vector space of dimension 6 (see Example 
1.55). On the other hand, the vanishing locus of I over Q consists 
precisely of the three points
(1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (0; 0; 1)
(see Example 0.7). Since it is clear from the symmetry of the 
generators of I that each point has the same multiplicity as a 
solution of I, we nd that each point has multiplicity 2. How to 
compute this using Singular will be shown in Example 2.59.
With respect to the intersection multiplicities in Bezout's the­
orem, let two square{free polynomials f; g 2 K [x; y] without a 
common factor be given. Let C; D A2 (K) be the curves de­
ned by f; g, and let p 2 A2 (K) be a point. Then the intersection
multiplicity of C and D at p is dened to be
ip(C; D) = mult(pjhf;gi):
Example 1.90 Consider the ane plane curves with equations
y2 — x2 (x + 1) = 0 and y2 + x3 = 0 :

1.2 Projective Algebraic Geometry 
53
Computing a lexicographic Grobner basis, we see that the curves 
intersect in the three points
P = (0; 0); qi = (-2 ; 4 P2), q2 = (~ 1; - 4 P2) :

> ideal I = y2-x3-x2, y2+x3;
> groebner(I);
_[1]=8y4-y2 
_[2]=2xy2+y2 
_[3]=x2-2y2
In Example 2.58, we will use Singular to check that the inter­
section multiplicities are as follows:
ip(C; D) = 4; iq1(C;D) = iq2(C;D) = 1:
1.2 Pro jective Algebraic Geometry
Example 1.90 at the end of the previous section shows that 
Bezout's theorem does not hold in the ane plane: Counted 
with multiplicity, the number of intersection points in A2(Q) is 
4 + 1 + 1 = 6, which is smaller than the product 3 3 = 9 of the 
degrees of the dening equations. To come up for the \missing" 
intersection points, we have to take the behaviour of the curves 
at innity into account. Formally, this means that we will work 
in the projective space instead of the ane space. In this way, 
many statements in algebraic geometry become simpler in that 
cumbersome case by case considerations are avoided.
1.2.1 The Projective Space
The idea of the projective plane goes back to Renaissance painters 
who considered \vanishing points" on the horizon to allow for 
perspective drawing:
p
horizon
q

54
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
The picture indicates that the missing intersection point of a class 
of parallel linesy in A2 (R) can be realized by asking that all lines 
in a given class meet in the same point at innity, with dierent 
classes corresponding to dierent points. Note that each class 
contains precisely one line through, say, the origin o:
This line is determined by its slope, where the slope is either a 
real number or, in the case of the y{axis, 1:
We may, thus, identify the set of all classes of parallel lines with 
the extended set
P1(R) := A1(R) [ f1g:
This set is called the real projective line. Intuitively, we should 
think of the pro jective line as the horizon H (in the rst picture of 
this section, the horizon is missing the point f1g, which in that 
picture corresponds to the class of lines parallel to the horizon).
y A class of parallel lines consists of all lines parallel to a given line.

1.2 Projective Algebraic Geometry
55
We may, then, dene the real projective plane by adding all 
points on H to A2(R):
P2 (R) := A2 (R) [H = A2 (R) [ P1(R):
A (projective) line in P2 (R) is, then, a line L A2 (R) together 
with the common point at innity of all lines parallel to L. More­
over, we regard H as a line in P2 (R), and call it the line at 
innity. This makes sense since, now, any pair of distinct lines 
determines a unique point, and any pair of distinct points deter­
mines a unique line.
Using the above denition, it is cumbersome to work with P2 (R) 
since we do not represent its points on equal footing: A point in 
A2 (R) is represented by its coordinates, a point in H by a class of 
parallel lines. To motivate the formal denition given below, we 
note that { similar to P1 (R) { we may think of P2 (R) as the set of 
lines through the origin, this time through the origin o in A3 (R):
Here, we write x0; x1 ;x2 for the coordinates on A3 (R) and choose 
V(x0 — 1) C A3 (R) as a reference plane for A2(R). Then each 
point of A2 (R) determines a line in A3 (R) through o. In this way, 
we get all lines through o, except those lying in the plane V(x0 ) 
which, in turn, form a copy of H .
We make the following general denition:

56 
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
Denition 1.91 The projective n{space over the eld K is the 
set
Pn(K) = lines through the origin in An+1 (K)
= one{dimensional linear subspaces of Kn+1 :
We call P1 (K) and P2 (K) the projective line and the projective 
plane over K , respectively.
Considering a line L through the origin o 2 An+1 (K) as an el­
ement of the new space Pn(K), we call it a point of Pn(K). 
This point p is, then, determined (or represented) by any point 
(a0;:::;an) 2 L n fog. Accordingly, we write p = (a0 : 
: an),
and call the tuple (a0;:::;an) a set of homogeneous coordi­
nates for p. Here, the colons indicate that the homogeneous 
coordinates are determined up to a nonzero scalar multiple (if 
ai 6= 0, the ratios aj : ai depend on p only).
Representing the points of Pn (K) in this way means that we re­
gard Pn(K) as the quotient of An+1 (K)nfog under the equivalence 
relation dened by (a0; : : : ; an) 
(b0; : : : ; bn) i (a0; : : : ; an) =
(b0 ; : : : ; bn) for some 0 6= 2 K :
Pn(K) = (An+1(K) n fog) = - ;
and we have the canonical pro jection
: An+1(K) n fog ! Pn(K); (a0; :::; an) 7! (a0 : 
: an):
1.2.2 Projective Algebraic Sets
Since homogeneous coordinates are determined up to scalar multi­
ples only, the denition of vanishing loci in the pro jective setting 
has to be done with some care. To illustrate what may hap­
pen, consider the polynomial f = y — x2 2 Q[x, y] and the point 
p= (1 : 1) = (2 : 2) 2 P1(Q): Clearly, f(1;1) =0,butf(2;2) 6=0. 
However, if a homogeneous polynomial f 2 K[x0 , : : :, xn] is given, 
then f (x0 , : : : , xn) = deg(f)f (x0 , : : : , xn) for all 2 K n f0g. 
This implies, then, that 
f(a0 , : : :, an) = 0 () f (a0, : : : , an) = 0 for all 2 K n f0g:

1.2 Projective Algebraic Geometry
57
Hence, if f is homogeneous, and p = (a0 : 
: an) 2 Pn(K), it
makes sense to say whether f (p) = 0 or f (p) 6= 0.
Denition 1.92 If T 
K[x0;:::;xn] is any set of homogeneous
polynomials, its vanishing locus in Pn (K) is the set
V(T) =fp2Pn(K)jf(p) =0for allf2Tg:
Every such set is called a projective algebraic set. If T = 
ff1;:::;frg is nite, we write V(f1;:::;fr) = V(T).
Example 1.93 The algebraic subsets of Pn (K) dened by homo­
geneous polynomials of degree 1 are precisely the subsets P(W) = 
one{dimensional linear subspaces of W 
Pn(K), where W
Kn+1 is a linear subspace. Every such subset is called a linear 
subspace of Pn(K) of dimension dimK(W) — 1.
To extend the correspondence between algebraic sets and ideals 
to the projective setting, we dene:
Denition 1.94 A homogeneous ideal of K[x0;:::; xn] is an 
ideal generated by homogeneous polynomials.
Note that any polynomial f 2 K[x0;:::;xn] can be uniquely writ­
ten as a sum f = f0 + f1 + f2 + : : : , where the fi are homogeneous 
of degree i. The fi are called the homogeneous components of 
f. It is easy to see that an ideal I of K[x0;:::;xn] is homogeneous 
i for each f 2 I , the homogeneous components of f are in I as 
well. Hence, by Hilbert's basis theorem, I is generated by nitely 
many homogeneous polynomials f1; : : : ; fr. We, then, dene the 
vanishing locus V(I) of I in Pn(K) to be V(I) = V(f1;:::;fr) 
(note that this denition is independent of the choice of homoge­
neous generators). In the same way, we dene the vanishing locus 
V(I) ofI in Pn(K).
Denition 1.95 If A 
Pn(K) is any subset, its vanishing ideal
in S = K[x0;:::;xn] is the homogeneous ideal
I(A) := hf 2 S j f is homogeneous and f(p) = 0 for all p 2 Ai:

58
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
The correspondences V and I behave as in the ane case, and no­
tions such as hypersurface, Zariski topology, irreducible (or 
subvariety of Pn(K)), and irreducible component are dened 
as earlier. The Nullstellensatz now reads as follows:
Theorem 1.96 (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, Pro jective Ver­
sion) Let I 
K[x0; : : :; xn] be a homogeneous ideal. Then:
(i) The vanishing locus V(I) of I in Pn (K) is empty i
I hx0; : : : ; xnik for some k 1:
(ii) If K = K and V(I) is nonempty, then 
I(V(I)) = pI:
This version of the Nullensatz can be easily deduced from its ane 
versions (consider the vanishing locus of I in An+1 (K)). Note that 
the radical of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous, too.

Our idea of taking innity into account when considering ane 
algebraic sets ts nicely with our formal denitions in the pro jec- 
tive setting. In fact, just as in our provisional denition of the 
real pro jective plane, we can write Pn (K) as the union of An (K) 
and a hyperplane at innity:
Pn(K) = U0 [ H0 = An(K) [ Pn-1 (K);
where
U0 := f(a0 : 
: an) 2 Pn(K) ja0 6= 0g;

1.2 Projective Algebraic Geometry
59
and H0 is the complement H0 = Pn(K) nU0 = V(x0). We identify 
H0 with Pn 1 (K) by disregarding the first coordinate, and U0 with 
An(K) via
'0 : U0 ! An(K); (a0 : 
: an) =(1: aa10 : 
: aan0)
(a1;:::;an):
7! a0 
a0
This map is bijective, with inverse
An(K) !U0; (b1;:::;bn) 7!(1 : b1 : 
: bn):
The algebraic concepts behind '0 and its inverse are dehomoge­
nization and homogenization, respectively. We recall the defini­
tions. Given a homogeneous polynomial F 2 K[x0;x1;:::;xn], 
the polynomial F(1;x1;:::;xn) 2 K[x1;:::;xn] is called the de­
homogenization of F with respect to x0 . Conversely, given a 
polynomial f 2 K[x1;:::;xn], the polynomial
fh := x0deg(f)f(x1=x0;:::; xn=x0) 2 K[x0;x1;:::;xn]
is homogeneous of degree deg(f), and is called the homogeniza­
tion of f with respect to x0 . We have
fh(1;x1;:::;xn) = f and F = xs0 F(1;x1;:::;xn)h;
where s is the highest power of x0 dividing F .
It is immediate from the definitions that if A = V(T) Pn(K) 
is a pro jective algebraic set, given by a set of homogeneous poly­
nomials T K[x0; x1 ;:::;xn], and Ta is obtained from T by 
dehomogenizing each polynomial of T with respect to x0 , then 
'0 (A \ U0) is the ane algebraic set V(Ta) An(K). In what 
follows, we will identify A \ U0 with '0 (A \ U0). Vice versa, if 
A = V(T) An(K) is any ane algebraic set, where now T is 
a subset of K [xi;...; xn], then it is easy to check that ‘0 1 (A) is 
the closed subset V(T h) \ U0 of U0 , where T h K[x0 ; : : : ; xn] is 
obtained from T by homogenizing each element of T with respect 
to x0. Regarding A as the subset ‘0 1(A) C Pn(K), the following 
definition makes sense:
Denition 1.98 If A C An(K) = U0 is an ane algebraic set, 
the smallest projective algebraic set A in Pn (K) containing A is 
called the projective closure of A.

60
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
Proposition 1.99 Let A 
An (K) = U0 be an ane algebraic
set, and let A be its projective closure in Pn (K). Then:
(i) A \ U0 = A.
(ii) A is irreducible i A is irreducible.
(iii) If A = V1 [ 
[ Vs is the decomposition into irreducible
components, then A = V 1 [ 
[ V s is the decomposition
into irreducible components.
In particular, no irreducible component of A is contained in the 
hyperplane at innity.
Denition 1.100 Let I K[x1; : : : ; xn] be an ideal. The ho­
mogenization of I with respect to an extra variable x0 is the 
ideal
Ih = hfh jf 2Ii 
K[x0;:::;xn]:
Proposition 1.101 Let I K[x1;:::;xn] be an ideal, and let Ih 
be its homogenization with respect to x0 . Considering vanishing 
loci over the algebraic closure K of K, we get: The projective 
algebraic set V(I h) Pn (K) is the projective closure of the ane 
algebraic set V(I) An(K).
We should point out that if nitely many generators for I are 
given, then the homogenized generators may fail to generate I h . 
For an example and the solution to the computational problem 
below, see Section 2.2.10 in the next Chapter.
Problem 1.102 Give an algorithm to nd homogenized ideals.
In the discussion above, there is nothing special with x0 : For 
0 i n, we dene Ui, Hi and 'i by using xi instead of x0. 
The Ui are known as the (ane) coordinate charts of Pn (K). 
They cover Pn(K):
Pn (K) = [n Ui:
i=0
Hence, Pn (K) looks locally like An (K), and we may study a pro­
jective algebraic set A Pn (K) by examining the dierent inter­
sections A \ Ui.

1.2 Projective Algebraic Geometry
61
Example 1.103 The ane plane curve
V((x2 + y2)(x — 1)2 — x2) G A2(R)
is known as the conchoide of Nicomedes. Its projective closure 
C is defined by the equation (x2 + y2)(x — z)2 — z2x2 = 0. We 
show C in all three coordinate charts:
z=1
(x2 + y2 )(x — 1)2 — x2 = 0
y=1
(x2 + 1)(x — z )2 — z2 x2 = 0
x=1
(1+ y2)(1 - z)2 - z2 = 0
To see all ane charts simultaneously, consider their preimage 
under the restriction of the projection A3 (R) n f0g ! P2 (R) to 
the unit sphere V(x2 + y2 + z2 — 1) G A3 (R):

In the picture, the great circles shown in black correspond to the 
respective lines V(z), V(y), and V(x) at innity. The curve C is 
shown in white.
Using coordinate charts, the notion of dimension carries over from 
the ane to the projective setting:
Denition 1.104 The dimension of a projective algebraic subset 
A = V(T) Pn(K), written dim(A), is the number
dim(A) = maxfdim(A \ Ui) j i = 0; : : : ; ng:
One can show that this number is one less than the dimension of 
the ane algebraic set dened by T in An+1 (K).
1.2.4 The Hilbert Polynomial
Let S = K[x0;:::;xn]. Recall that each polynomial f 2 S can be 
uniquely written as the sum of its homogeneous components. Ring 
theorLetically, this means that S can be written as the direct sum 
S = d 0 Sd, where Sd consists of the homogeneous polynomials 
of degree d. This decomposition is compatible with multiplication 
in the sense that Sd Se Sd+e . We refer to this fact by saying 
that S is a graded ring. In the same spirit, an ideal I S is 
homogeneous i it can be written as a direct sum
I=M(I\Sd):
d0
In turn, this means that the quotient ring S=I inherits a grading 
S=I=Md 0(S=I)d = Md 0 Sd=(I \ Sd):

1.2 Projective Algebraic Geometry
63
To simplify our notation in what follows, we will write M = S=I 
and, accordingly, Md = (S=I)d.
Denition 1.105 The function
HM : N ! N; d 7! dimK (Md);
is called the Hilbert function of M . The formal power series 
HPM (t) :=dX0HM(d)td2Z[[t]]
is called the Hilbert{Poincare series of M .
Hilbert showed that the innitely many values of the Hilbert func­
tion can be expressed in nite terms:
Theorem 1.106 (Polynomial Nature of the Hilbert Func­
tion) There exists a unique polynomial PM (t) 2 Q [t] such that
HM (d) = PM (d) for all d 
0:
This polynomial is called the Hilbert polynomial of M = S=I .
Remark 1.107 An important fact is that the degree of PM (t) is 
equal to dim(I) — 1. In algebraic geometry, the Hilbert polyno­
mial is used to rediscover or dene numerical invariants of pro­
jective algebraic sets and their embedding. For this purpose, if 
A Pn (K) is a projective algebraic set with homogeneous co­
ordinate ring K[A] = K[x0; : : : ; xn]=I(A), we dene the Hilbert 
polynomial of A to be the polynomial PA(t) = PK[A] (t). Then 
the degree d of PA is the dimension of A. The degree of A, 
written deg(A), is dened to be d! times the leading coecient 
of PA(t). Geometrically, this is the number of points in which A 
meets a suciently general linear subspace of Pn (K) of comple­
mentary dimension n — d. Furthermore, the arithmetic genus 
of A is defined to be pa(A) = ( — 1)d(PA(0) — 1). It is, then, 
clear that the Hilbert polynomial of a pro jectice algebraic curve 
C is of type PC(t) = deg(C) ■ t — pa + 1. Note that invariants 
of algebraic sets are often useful in that they allow us to parti­
tion a given classification problem into more handy pieces. See 
[Decker and Schreyer (2013)] for more details.

64 
The Geometry{Algebra Dictionary
Another way of expressing the innitely many values of the Hilbert 
function in nite terms is to represent the Hilbert{Poincare series 
as a rational function. There are two ways of doing this:
Theorem 1.108 (Representation of the Hilbert{Poincare 
Series I) There exists a unique polynomial QM (t) 2 Z[t] such 
that
HPM (t) = QM(t) : 
M7 (1 - t)n
Theorem 1.109 (Representation of the Hilbert{Poincare
Series II) Let d = deg(PM(t)) = dim(I) — 1. There exists a 
unique polynomial QbM (t) 2 Z[t] with QbM(1) 6= 0 and such that
HP 
QbM (t)
HPM (t) = (1 _ t)d+1 :
Problem 1.110 Give algorithms for nding the Hilbert{Poincare 
series and the Hilbert polynomial, respectively.
Remark 1.111 The computation of the Hilbert polynomial can 
be reduced to that of the Hilbert{Poincare series represented as in 
Theorem 1.109. Indeed, if Qb(Mi) denotes the ith formal derivative 
of QbM (dened by mimicking the usual rules of dierentiation), 
and if we set 
ai
Qb(Mi)(1) 
i!
i = 0;: : : ;d;
then
Pm (t) = XX (-1)d-iad-/t + ^- 
i
i=0
We will come back to this in Section 2.3, where we will show 
how to compute the Hilbert{Poincare series and give Singular 
examples.

Computing
In this chapter, we will present solutions to the computational 
problems stated in the previous chapter. We will give the most 
important denitions and theorems, some proofs, and a number of 
examples. All proofs can be found in [Greuel and Pster (2007)]. 
Most of the Singular examples can be found on the CD in 
[Greuel and Pster (2007)]. We will, again, work over a eld K.
2.1 Standard Bases and Singular
We begin by introducing a general and exible notion of monomial 
ordering. Relying on this, we will treat the concept of standard 
bases, which is more general than that of Grobner bases. In fact, 
standard bases will allow us to compute not only in
polynomial rings and
quotient rings of polynomial rings,
but also in
localizations of the above.
In geometrical applications, the latter is needed for local studies 
as in Section 1.1.9.
To simplify our notation, we write K[x] = K[x1;:::;xn] for the 
polynomial ring over K in the set of variables x = fx1 ; : : : ; xng. 
As in the previous chapter, a monomial in x = fx1 ; : : :; xng is 
written using multi{indices: If = (1;:::;n) 2 Nn, set x =
65

66 
Computing
x11 
xnn and deg(x) = 1 + 
+ n. We write
Monn := Mon(x1 ;:::;xn) := fx j 2 Nng:
Each nonzero polynomial f 2 K [x] is a K {linear combination of 
dierent monomials, with nonzero scalars. Our starting point is 
that this representation of f is only determined up to the order 
of its summands. We can make this order unique by choosing a 
total ordering on the set of monomials. For our purposes, it is 
necessary that the orderings considered are compatible with the 
semigroup structure on the set of monomials.
Denition 2.1 A monomial ordering (or semigroup order­
ing) on Monn is a total orderingy > on Monn satisfying
x > x =) xx > xx; for all ; ; 2 Nn:
If R is any ring, and > is a monomial ordering on Monn , then 
we also say that > is a monomial ordering on R[x].
Denition 2.2 Let > be a xed monomial ordering on Monn. 
Given a polynomial 0 6= f 2 K [x], we write it in a unique way as 
a sum of nonzero terms:
f = ax + ax + 
+ ax; x > x > 
> x;
with a; a; : : :; a 2 K. Then we dene:
LM(f) := leadmonom(f) := x;
LE(f) := leadexp(f) := ;
LT(f) := lead(f) := ax;
LC(f) := leadcoef(f) := a;
tail(f) := f — LT(f) = apxp + ■ ■ ■ + a7x7, 
ecart(f) := deg(f) - deg(LM(f)).
y Given a relation on a set M and a; b 2 M , we write a > b if a b and 
a 6= b. We then call > a total ordering on M if is a total ordering on M . 
That is, the following hold for all a; b; c 2 M: (1) If a b and b a, then 
a = b (Antisymmetry). (2) If a b and b c, then a c (Transitivity). 
(3) a b or b a (Totality).

2.1 Standard Bases and Singular
67
We refer to these data as the leading monomial, the leading 
exponent, the leading term, the leading coecient, the tail, 
and the ecart of f , respectively.
Singular Example 2.3 With respect to the lexicographical or­
dering >lp (formally dened in Example 2.7 below), we get:
> ring R = 0, (x,y,z), lp;
> poly f = y4z3+2x2y2z2+3x5+4z4+5y2;

Denition 2.4 A monomial ordering > on Monn is called
(i) global if x > 1 for all 6= (0; : : : ; 0),
(ii) local if x < 1 for all 6= (0; : : : ; 0), and
(iii) mixed if it is neither global nor local.
Remark 2.5
(i) Since a monomial ordering is compatible with the semi­
group structure on Monn , it suces to check the dening 
conditions above for the variables xi, i = 1; : : : ; n.
(ii) Mixed orderings are needed, for instance, to eliminate vari­
ables with respect to a local monomial ordering (see Ex­
ample 2.34). They will not play a role in this book.
Lemma 2.6 Let > be a monomial ordering on Monn . Then the 
following are equivalent:
(i) > is a well{orderingy.
(ii) > is global.
y A well{ordering is a total ordering on a set such that each nonempty subset 
has a least element.

68
Computing
Proof To show (i) ) (ii), suppose that > is not global, so that 
xi < 1 for some i. Then f(xi)n gn0 is a set of monomials with 
no least element, so that > is not a well{ordering. Conversely, to 
show (ii) ) (i), suppose that > is global, and let M 
Monn be
a nonempty set of monomials. Then, by Dickson's Lemma 1.5, 
the ideal generated by M in K [x] is, in fact, generated by a nite 
subset L M. This means that every element x 2 M is divisible 
by an element x 2 L. But then x < x since xi > 1 for all i. 
We conclude that the least element of L (which exists since L is 
nite) is a least element of M.
Example 2.7 The following are examples of monomial orderings:
(i) The lexicographical ordering >lp :
xa >ip x3 :, 9 1 < i < n : «i = Pi, • • •, ai.-i = Pi—1, 
i > i :
(ii) The degree reverse lexicographical ordering >dp:

deg(x) = deg(x) and 9 1 i n :
n = Pn; • • • ; i+1 = Pi+1 ; i < Pi •
(iii) The local lexicographical ordering >is :

i < Pi •
(iv) The local degree reverse lexicographical ordering

x >ds x3 :, deg(x) < deg(x3) or
deg(x) = deg(x3) and 9 1 < i < n :
n = Pn; • • • ; i+1 = Pi+1 ; i < Pi •
(v) Product orderings: Let >1 and >2 be monomial or­
derings on Mon(x1; • • • ; xs) and Mon(xs+1; • • • ; xn), respec­
tively. The product ordering > = (>1 ; >2) is dened

Note that >lp and >dp are global. A product ordering (>1; >2) 
is global i >1 and >2 are global. The characterization of global 
matrix orderings is left as an exercise for the reader.

Lemma 2.9 Let > be a monomial ordering on Monn. Then
S> := fu 2 K[x] n f0g j LM(u) = 1g
is a multiplicatively closed set. That is, 1 2 S> and the prod­
uct of any two elements of S> is in S> .
y Every monomial ordering can be dened by a matrix (see 
[Greuel and Pster (2007)]).
z If K is any eld, GL(n; K) denotes the general linear group consisting of 
all invertible n n matrix with entries in K.

Proof For f;g 2 K[x] r f0g, we have LM(f g) = LM(f)LM(g).
□
The technique of localizing rings at multiplicatively closed sets is 
central to commutative algebra. It has important applications in 
the local study of algebraic sets (this is where the name localiza­
tion comes from). By localizing at the multiplicative closed subset 
K [x] n hxi, for instance, we get the ring of fractions O0 considered 
in Section 1.1.9. In the algebraic setting, this ring is usually de­
noted by K [x]hxi. In the context of standard bases, the general 
denition of localization boils down to the following: If > is any 
monomial ordering on Monn , then set
f
u
K[x]> := S .' K[x] =
f; u 2 K [x]; u 6= 0; LM(u) = 1
Here, f=u denotes the equivalence class of (f; u) 2 K[x] 
S>
under the equivalence relation dened by
(f; u) 
(f0;u0) () fu0 = uf0:
The set K [x]> becomes a ring, with algebraic operations 
a a0 ab0 + a0b 
a a0 aa0
b + b0 = bb0 
; 
b b0 = bb0:
Denition 2.10 If > is a monomial ordering on Monn, then the 
localization of K[x] with respect to S> (or the ring asso­
ciated to K[x] and >) is the ring K [x]> dened above.
In what follows, > will denote a xed monomial ordering on Monn .
Remark 2.11 The following properties are easy to prove:
(i) There are canonical inclusions
K[x] 
K[x]> 
K[x]hxi:
(ii) K[x]> = K[x] i S> = Knf0gi > is global.
(iii) K [x]> = K [x]hxi i S> = K [x] n hxi i > is local.
Denition 2.12 Given 0 6= f 2 K [x]> , we choose u 2 K[x] n f0g 
such that LT(u) = 1 and uf 2 K [x]. Then, generalizing the 

2.1 Standard Bases and Singular
71
notions introduced in Denition 2.2 for polynomials, we dene:y
LM(f) := LM(uf); 
LE(f) := LE(uf);
LT(f) := LT(uf); 
LC(f) := LC(uf);
tail(f) := f - LT(f).
Denition 2.13 For any subset G 
K[x]>, the leading ideal
of G is the ideal of K [x] dened by
L>(G) := L(G) := hLM(g) jg2Gnf0giK[x]:
Denition 2.14 Let I 
K[x] > be an ideal.
(i) A nite set G 
K [x]> is called a standard basisz of I if
GI and L(I) =L(G):
That is, the leading monomials of the elements of G gen­
erate the leading ideal of I or, in turn, for any f 2 I n f0g 
there exists an element g 2 G such that LM(g)jLM(f).
(ii) If we just say that G is a standard basis, we mean that G 
is a standard basis of the ideal hGiK [x]> generated by G.
(iii) If > is global, a standard basis is also called a Griibner 
basis.
Proposition 2.15 Each nonzero ideal I K [x]> has a standard 
basis G, consisting of elements in K [x]. Moreover, ifg; h 2 G and 
LM(g)jLM(h), then G r fhg is also a standard basis of I.
Proof By Dickson's Lemma 1.5, L(I) is generated by a nite set of 
leading monomials LM(f), f 2 I. That is, there are f1 ;: : : ;fr 2 I 
such that L(I) = hLM(f1);: : : ; LM(fr)i. Clearing denominators, 
we may assume that the fi are in K [x], proving the rst statement. 
The second statement holds since L(G) = L(G r fhg).
y It is easy to see that the denition does not depend on the choice of u.
z As already said in the previous chapter, the idea of standard bases goes 
back to Gordan [Gordan (1899)]. Later, monomial orderings were used 
by Macaulay [Macaulay (1939)] and Grobner [Grobner (1939)] to study 
Hilbert functions of graded ideals and, more generally, to nd K{bases of 
zero{dimensional quotient rings. Formally, the notion of a standard basis 
was introduced independently by Hironaka [Hironaka (1964)] and Grauert 
[Grauert (1972)] (for special local orderings). The name Grobner basis in 
the case of global orderings was coined by Buchberger [Buchberger (1965)]. 

72
Computing
Denition 2.16 A standard basis G = ff1;:::;frg is called a 
reduced standard basis if the following hold for all i:
(i) LC(fi) = 1.
(ii) LM(fi) is not divisible by LM(fj), for j 6= i.
(iii) No monomial of tail(fi) is divisible by LM(fj), for all j .
Remark 2.17 If > is global and, hence, a well{ordering, each 
nonzero ideal of K [x] has a unique reduced Grobner basis.
Singular Example 2.18
> ring R = 0, (x,y), dp; // a global ordering
> 
ideal I = x3+2y2+5, x3+3y2+x+5;
> 
ideal GI = std(I); // compute a standard (Groebner) basis
> 
GI;
GI[1]=y2+x
GI[2]=x3+3y2+x+5
> option(redSB); // to obtain a reduced standard basis
> 
GI = std(GI); GI;
J[1]=y2+x
J[2]=x3-2x+5
The computation of standard bases as in the example above is 
based on a practical standard basis criterion. For this, we need:
Denition 2.19 Let f;g 2 K[x] n f0g with LM(f) = x and 
LM(g) = x. Let x := lcm(x; x) be the least common multiple 
of x and x.y We dene the s{polynomial of f and g by
LC(f)
spoly(f;g) := x1 f - LC(g) • x7 pg:
If LM(g) divides LM(f), the s{polynomial is particularly simple:
SP0ly(f;g) = f ~ 5f1 • x" "'g ;
LC(g)
and LM spoly(f; g) < LM(f).
Before we show how to implement the s{polynomial in Singular, 
we note that we can use Singular's C{like user language, in 
particular, to dene procedures which combine several commands 
to form a new one. A procedure denition begins with the keyword
y Note that = max(1 ; 1); : :: ; max(n; n) .

2.1 Standard Bases and Singular

proc followed by a name and an optional parameter list with 
specied Singular types. Return values of a procedure can be 
specied by using the return command.
Singular Example 2.20 We implement s{polynomials:
> ring R = 0, (x,y,z,t), lp;
> proc spoly(poly f, poly g) 
.{
. 
poly m = lcm(leadmonom(f),leadmonom(g));
. 
poly h = m/leadmonom(f)*f

-leadcoef(f)/leadcoef(g)*m/leadmonom(g)*g;
. return(h);
.}
> poly f = 7x3y+zt; poly g = 8xyzt+y2;
> spoly(f,g);
-7/8x2y2+z2t2
In view of the desired standard bases criterion, but also with re­
gard to actually computing standard bases, the notions of normal 
form (for global monomial orderings) and weak normal form (for 
nonglobal monomial orderings) are crucial. The global case is 
technically simpler and therefore treated rst. The idea behind 
normal forms is to extend Euclidean division with remainder to 
polynomials in several variables, allowing at the same time more 
than one divisor. We will later present an axiomatic approach 
which will specify the properties of normal forms. For now, we in­
troduce normal forms by giving an algorithm to compute them:
Algorithm 1 NF(f jG)
Input: > a global monomial ordering, f 2 K [x], G a nite list of 
elements in K[x]
Output: h 2 K [x], a normal form of f with respect to G
if f = 0 then
return 0;
h:=f;
while h 6= 0 and Th := fg 2 G j LM(g)jLM(h)g 6= ; do 
choose the rst g 2 Th ;
h := spoly(h; g);
return h;

74
Computing
Remark 2.21 The algorithm terminates since > is global and, 
thus, a well{ordering, and since always LM(h) > LM(spoly(h; g)). 
If h = NF(f j G) 6= 0, then LM(h) is not divisible by any LM(g), 
g 2 G. If we replace the last line of the algorithm by the line
return LT(h) + NF(tail(h) j G);
then none of the monomials of the normal form is divisible by any 
LM(g), g 2 G. We will, then, speak of a reduced normal form.
Singular Example 2.22
> ring R = 0, (x,y,z), dp;
> poly f = x2yz+xy2z+y2z+z3+xy;
> poly f1 = xy+y2-1; poly f2 = xy; ideal I = f1, f2;
> reduce(f,I);
// ** I is no standard basis

// reduced NF w.r.t. a non-standard basis

> reduce(f,GI); // reduced NF

Still focusing on the global case, we now formulate the desired 
standard basis criterion:
Theorem 2.23 (Buchberger's Criterion) Let I K [x] be an 
ideal, let G = fg1 ; : : : ; gsg I, and let > be a global monomial 
ordering on Monn . Then the following are equivalent:
(i) G is a standard basis of I .
(ii) For all f 2 K [x], we have NF(f j G) = 0 i f 2 I.
(iii) NF(spoly(gi; gj) jG) = 0 for all i < j.
Proof (i) ) (ii) ) (iii) are consequences of Proposition 2.27 
below: note that spoly(gi; gj) 2 I for all i < j. (iii) ) (i) is the 
dicult part. See [Greuel and Pster (2007)] for details.

2.1 Standard Bases and Singular 
75
The criterion yields the following standard basis algorithm:
Algorithm 2 std(f j F)
Input: > a global monomial ordering, F 
K [x] a nite set of
polynomials
Output: G, a standard basis of hF i
G:=F;
P := f(f; g) jf;g2Gg;
while P 6= ; do
choose (f; g) 2 P;
P := P rf(f;g)g;
h := NF(spoly(f; g) jG);
if h 6= 0 then
P :=P[f(f;h) jf2Gg;
G := G[fhg;
return G;
Now, we address the nonglobal case:
Remark 2.24 Theorem 2.23 is also true for a nonglobal mono­
mial ordering > if we replace K[x] by K [x]> and if we choose a 
weak normal form NF as in Denition 2.25 below. Whereas nor­
mal forms may not exist in the nonglobal case, weak normal forms 
can be computed by Algorithm 3 below. Based on this, Algorithm 
2 will compute a polynomial standard basis of hF iK[x]> .y
Denition 2.25 Let > be any monomial ordering on K [x], and 
let G denote the set of all nite lists G 
K [x]> . Then a map
NF : K[x]> 
G!K[x]>; (f; G) 7! NF(f jG);
is called a weak normal form on K [x]> if, for all G 2 G,
(i) NF(0jG)=0,
y For global orderings, Algorithm 2.1 is Buchberger's algorithm, which gen­
eralizes both Gaussian elimination and Euclid's gcd algorithm. For local 
orderings, it is Mora's tangent cone algorithm, which itself is a variant of 
Buchberger's algorithm. The general case is a variation of Mora's algo­
rithm, which is due to Greuel and Pster and has been implemented in 
Singular since 1990 (see [Greuel and Pster (2007)]). 

76
Computing
and, for all f 2 K [x]> and G 2 G, we have:
(ii) NF(f j G) = 0 =) LM(NF(f j G)) 2 L(G).
(iii) There is a standard representation for f with respect 
to NF(— j G). That is, if G = f gi;... ;gsg, there exists a 
unit u 2 K [x]> together with an expression of type
uf - NF(f j G) = 
aigi; ai 2 K[x]> ; s > 0 ;
i=1
where LM( is=1 aigi) > LM(aj gj) for all j with ajgj 6= 0. 
If > is global, and u = 1 in (iii), then NF is called a normal 
form on K [x]. A normal form is reduced if no monomial of 
NF(f j G) is divisible by a leading monomial of an element of G.
In (iii) above, if f 2 K[x] and G K [x], then u; a1; : : : ; as can be 
chosen to be in K[x] as well.
Proposition 2.26 Let > be a monomial ordering on K [x]. Then 
there exists a weak normal form on K [x]> . If > is global, then 
there exists a normal form on K [x].
Proof The second statement is clear from Algorithm 1, the rst 
one from Algorithm 3 below. For a proof that Algorithm 3 termi­
nates, see [Greuel and Pster (2007)] (this is more dicult than 
showing that Algorithm 1 terminates).
Algorithm 3 weakNF(f j G)
Input: > a monomial ordering, f 2 K [x], G a nite list in K [x]
Output: h 2 K [x], a weak normal form of f with respect to G 
h:=f;
T := G;
while h 6= 0 and Th := fg 2 T j LM(g)jLM(h)g 6= ;do 
choose the rst g 2 Th with minimal ecart(g);
if ecart(g) > ecart(h) then
T := T [ fhg;
h := spoly(h; g);
return h;

2.1 Standard Bases and Singular
77
Proposition 2.27 Let > be a monomial ordering on K [x], let 
I K [x]> be an ideal, and let NF be a weak normal form on 
K [x]> . Let G be a standard basis of I . Then the following hold:
(i) For any f 2 K[x]>, we have f 2 I i NF(f j G) = 0.
(ii) G generates I .y
(iii) If > is global, if NF is a reduced normal form, and if 
f 2 K [x], then NF(f j G) only depends on > and I .
Proof (i) Assume f 2 K[x] and G = fg1;:::;gsg K [x]. Let
uf = Xs aigi + NF(f j G) 
(2.1)
i=1
be a standard representation, with u 2 S> ;a1;:::;as 2 K [x]. 
Note that u is a unit in K[x]>. If NF(f j G) = 0, then uf 2 I, 
hence f 2 I. If NF(f j G) 6= 0, then LM(NF(f j G)) 2= L(G) = 
L(I), hence NF(f jG) 2= I. This implies f 2= I.
(ii) follows from (i) and (2.1).
To prove (iii), let NF be another reduced normal form. Given 
f 2 K [x], we have standard representations f = is=1 aigi + 
NF(f j G) and f = Pis=1 aigi + NF(f j G), with ai; ai 2 K[x]. 
This implies that NF(f j G) — NF(f j G) 2 I. Hence, if we 
would have NF(f j G) 6= NF(f j G) for some f, then one of the 
monomials of NF(f j G) or NF(f j G) would be in L(I) = L(G), 
a contradiction to the properties of reduced normal forms.
We are, now, ready to nish Gordan's proof of Hilbert's basis 
theorem (see Section 1.1.1). More generally, we show:
Corollary 2.28 Each ring of type K [x]> is Noetherian.
Proof Proposition 2.15 shows that every ideal in K [x]> has a 
(nite) standard basis. By part (ii) of Proposition 2.27, this stan­
dard basis generates the ideal.
y If f1 ;:::;fr 2 K[x] are generators for I K [x]>, and G K[x], then G 
does not necessarily generate the ideal I = hf1 ;:::;friK[x] . Consider the 
following example: Let x be a single variable, let > be the unique local 
ordering on K[x], and let I K[x]> be the ideal generated by x. Then
x2 + x = (x + 1) x 2 Ie, but hx2 + xiK[x] ( Ie since x 2= hx2 + xiK[x] . 
Nevertheless, G = fx + x2 g is a standard basis of I generating I .

78
Computing
The standard basis algorithm requires the choice of a monomial 
ordering. The performance of the algorithm and the resulting 
basis depend in a crucial way on this choice.
Singular Example 2.29
> ring R1 = 32003, x(1..5), lp;
> int d = 8;
> ideal MId = maxideal(d);
> LIB "random.lib";

This example is somewhat typical since usually the ordering >dp 
performs better than others. Therefore, if no special properties of 
the resulting Grobner basis are needed, it is recommended to use 
>dp . On the other hand, computing the image of a polynomial 
map requires orderings such as >lp (see Section 2.2). This can 
cause problems in that there are examples in which the direct 
computation of a Grobner basis with respect to >lp is not feasible, 
whereas a Grobner basis with respect to >dp can be computed in 
almost no time.

Grobner basis conversion algorithms take their cue from 
what we just observed: In principle, they compute a Grobner 
basis with respect to an appropriately chosen fast ordering, and 
convert the result to a Grobner basis with respect to the desired 
slow ordering.
If I K [x] is a zero{dimensional ideal, then K [x]=I is a nite 
dimensional K {vector space (see Remark 1.86). In this case, the 
so called FGLM conversion algorithm (see [Faugere et al. (1993)]) 
converts Grobner bases by means of linear algebra (Gaussian elim­
ination). We reconsider the example above using FGLM:

Computing
A conversion algorithm which works even if K [x]=I is not nite 
dimensional is the Grobner walk algorithm which approaches the 
target Grobner basis for I in several steps, “walking” along a path 
through the so called Grobner fan of I. In each step, a Grobner 
basis with respect to an \intermediate" monomial ordering is com­
puted. There are several strategies to choose the path through the 
Grobner fan, leading to different variants of the algorithm. In our 
example, we use the so called fractal walk and get:
> LIB "grwalk.lib";
> t = timer;
> ideal JJ = fwalk(I);
> timer - t;

One can show that each ideal I K [x] has only nitely many 
distinct leading ideals as we vary over all global monomial order­
ings on K [x]. Equivalently, there are only nitely many distinct 
reduced Grobner bases. Roughly speaking, the Grobner fan of I 
is a fan of polyhedral cones such that the topdimensional cones 
correspond to the different reduced Grobner bases. Rather than 
giving a formal definition, we illustrate the Grobner fan by exam­
ples.
Example 2.31 Let I = hx2+y3,y4i G Q[x;y]. Then the Grobner 
fan of I consists of the following two cones:
Any point in one of the Ci defines a line through this point and 
the origin with a certain slope m. Consider the matrix ordering 
>Mm defined by
Mm 
1
0
m
1

2.2 Applications
81
Then fy3+x2, x2y, x4g is a Grohner basis of I with respect to >Mm 
for all points in C2 (that is, for all 1 > m > 32 ). Furthermore, 
fx2 + y3; y4 g is a GrObner basis with respect to >Mm for all points 
in C1 (that is, for all 23 > m 0). Note that C1 contains the point 
(1; 0) for which >Mm is just >lp, and C2 contains the point (1; 1) 
for which >Mm is what is called the the degree lexicographical 
ordering, written >Dp .
The Grobner fan of the ideal I = hx2 — y3; x3 — y2 + x) G Q[x; y] 
is more complicated:
Note that C1, again, contains the point (1; 0) corresponding to >lp 
(as usual, with x > y). Here, the Grobner basis is fy3 — x2 ;x3 — 
y2 + xg. The cone C4 contains the point (1; 1) corresponding to 
>Dp. Here, the Grobner basis is fy3 — x2;x3 — y2 + xg. With 
respect to orderings corresponding to points in C7 , the Groobner 
basis is fx8 — 3x6 + 3x4 — x3 — x2; xy — x7 + 2x5 — x3 + x2, y2 — 
x3 — xg. In particular, this is a Grobner basis with respect to the 
lexicographical ordering (now, with y > x).
2.2 Applications
Within this section, we explain how to solve a number of compu­
tational problems in commutative algebra using standard bases.

a (weak) normal form NF(f j G). Then f 2 I i NF(f j G) = 0. 
Correctness follows from Proposition 2.27.

2.2.2 Elimination
Problem: Given f1;:::;fr 2 K[x], let I = hf1;:::;friK[x] . We 
wish to nd generators of the kth elimination ideal
Ik = I \ K[xk+1;:::;xn] :
Elements of the ideal Ik are said to be obtained from f1 ; : : : ; fr 
by eliminating x1;:::;xk.
Denition 2.33 A monomial ordering > on K[x1;:::;xn] is 
called an elimination ordering for x1;:::; xk if
LM(f) 2 K[xk+1;:::;xn] =) f 2 K[xk+1;:::; xn]
for all nonzero f 2 K[x1;:::;xn].
Example 2.34 The lexicographical ordering >lp is an elimination 
ordering for any initial set of initial variables x1 ; : : : ; xk . If k is 
xed, >1 is any global monomial ordering on K[x1;:::;xk], and >2 
is arbitrary, consider the product ordering > = (>1; >2) (which 
is a mixed ordering if >2 is local). Then
K[x1;:::;xn]> = K[xk+1;:::;xn]>2 [x1;:::;xk];
and > is an elimination ordering for x1 ; : : : ; xk . Note, however, 
that no local monomial ordering has this property : If 1 > xi for 

2.2 Applications
83
some i k and > is local, then LM(1+xi) = 1 2 K[xk+1;:::;xn], 
but 1 + xi 62 K[xk+1;:::;xn].
The following lemma allows us to solve the elimination problem:
Lemma 2.35 Let > be an elimination ordering for x1;:::;xk 
on Mon(x1;:::;xn), and let I K[x1;:::;xn]> be an ideal. If 
G K [x] is a standard basis of I, then
G0:= fg2GjLM(g) 2 K[xk+1;:::;xn]g
is a standard basis of I0 := I \ K[xk+1;:::; xn]>0, where >0 on 
Mon(xk+1;:::; xn) is induced by >. In particular, I0 = hG0i.
Proof Writing R0 = K[xk+1;:::;xn], we rst have G0 R0: If 
LM(g) 2 R0, then g 2 R0 since > is an elimination ordering for 
x1;:::;xk. Second, if f 2 I \ R0, then there is a g 2 G such that 
LM(g)jLM(f). This implies that LM(g) 2 R0, so that g 2 G0.

we want to decide whether f 2 I .
As already stated in Corollary 1.31, a solution to this problem is 
based on the trick of Rabinowitsch:y
Lemma 2.37 Let R be a ring, let I R be an ideal, and let 
f 2 R. If t is an extra variable, then
f 2 pi () 1 2 J := hi; 1 - tfiR[t]:
Proof If f 2 
I, then fk 2 I for a suitable k . In particular,
tkfk 2 J and, thus,
1 = tk f k + (1 - tk f k)
= tk f k + (1 - tf )(1 + tf + ::: + tk ' 1 f 
) 2 J.
The other direction is similar to the corresponding part of the 
proof of Theorem 1.29.

elements of G \ K[y] generate ker . View R := K[y]=ker as a 
subring of S by means of .
Problem: Given R S as above, decide whether R S is integral.
Lemma 2.45 With notation as above, R S is integral i for 
each i, 1 i n, there is an element of G whose leading mono­
mial is of type xii, for some i 1.
Proof Inductively, starting with i = n, an element of G with 
leading monomial xii denes an integral equation for xi over 
R[xi+1; : : : ; xn]. Hence, the result follows from Remark 1.75. See 
[Greuel and Pster (2007)] for details.

that it is integral since we have the integral equations t — y = 0

that:
(i) y1 ; : : : ; yd are algebraically independent over K .
(ii) K [y1; : : : ; yd] 
K [x]=I is an integral ring extension.

Solution (see Remarks 1.71, 1.72): Assume that K is innite. Let
be a random lower triangular linear coordinate change, and let 
G = ff1.:::; frg be the reduced Grobner basis of 0(I) with re­
spect to the lexicographical ordering, with x1 > 
> xn. Sup­
pose that G is sorted such that LM(fr) >

minimal with G \ K [xc+1 ; : : : ; xn] = ;. Then the residue classes 
xc+1 ; : : : ; xn 2 K [x]=(I) are algebraically independent over K.
For i = 1; : : : ; c, test whether G contains a polynomial with 
leading monomial xii for some i 1. If the test returns true for 
all i, then K [xc+1 ; : : : ; xn] K [x]=(I) is a Noether normaliza­
tion. This implies that K[o 1 (xc . 1)..... o 1 (xn)] C K[x]/I is a 
Noether normalization. If the test returns false for some i, then 
try again with a new choice of o.

nization Ih = hfh j f 2 Ii K[x0;:::;xn] (see Denition 1.100). 
Solution: If G = fg1;... ;gsg is a Grobner basis of I with respect 
to some global degree orderingy >, then Ih = hg1h ; : : : ; gsh i:
Lemma 2.50 With notation as above, Ih = hg1h; : : : ; gshi.
Proof Let f 2 I. Then, since G is a Grobner basis, f has a stan­
dard representation of type f = 
higi (see Denition 2.25 and
i=1
Proposition 2.27). That is, LM(f) 
LM(higi) for all i with higi 6=

2.3 Dimension and the Hilbert Function
The computation of dimension, of the Hilbert function, and of the 
Hilbert polynomial will be discussed and explained.
Problem: Let I ( K[x] be an ideal. Compute the Krull dimen­
sion dim(K [x]=I) = dim(I) and the K {vector space dimension 
dimK (K [x]=I).
Proposition 2.52 Let I ( K [x] be an ideal. Then
dim(I) = d;
where d is the maximal cardinality of a subset of variables u 
fx1 ; : : : ; xng with
I \ K [u] = h0i:
Proof For a proof, see [Decker and Schreyer (2013)].
Note that this includes the case d = 0 in which I \ K [xi] ) h0i 
for all i (see Remark 1.86 and Proposition 1.32).
Denition 2.53 A maximal independent set of variables for 
I is a subset u of variables of maximal cardinality as above.
Example 2.54 If I = hxy; xzi K[x;y;z], then I\ K[y; z] = h0i 
and I \ K[x] = h0i. The sets fy; zg and fxg are maximal in the 
sense that they cannot be extended. But only u = fy; zg is a 
maximal independent set for I .

2.3 Dimension and the Hilbert Function
93
Proposition 2.52 does not give a practical method for nding the 
Krull dimension since it requires the computation of quite a num­
ber of dierent elimination ideals. On the other hand, by Lemma 
2.57 below, the case of a monomial ideal can be handled in a 
purely combinatorial way. Hence, the following result is the key 
to computing dimension in general:
Proposition 2.55 Let > be any monomial ordering on K[x], and 
let I K[x] be an ideal. Then
dim(K[x]>=IK[x]>) = dim(K [x]=L(I))
and
dimK(K[x]>=IK[x]>) = dimK (K [x]=L(I)):
Moreover, if dimK(K[x]>=IK[x]>) < 1 or > is a global ordering, 
then the monomials in K [x] r L(I) represent a basis of the K{ 
vector space K[x]>=IK[x]> .
Proof For a proof, see [Greuel and Pster (2007)].
Singular Example 2.56 With respect to >dp, considering the 
reduced Grobner basis
fi = x2 - y; f2 = xy - z; f3 = y2 - xz
of the ideal of the twisted cubic curve C (see Example 2.51), we 
see that L(I) = hx2 ; xy; y2i. Since u = fzg is a set of variables of 
maximal cardinality with
hx2; xy; y2i \ K[u] = h0i;

94
Computing
this shows once more that the dimension of C is 1 (see Example 
1.83). In Singular, this can be checked using the dim command:
> ring R = 0, (x,y,z), dp;
> ideal I = y-x2, z-x3;
> dim(std(I));
1
The dim command is based on Proposition 2.55 and the purely 
combinatorial lemma below:
Lemma 2.57 Let I = hm1 ;:::;mki 
K[x] be an ideal with
monomial generators mi . Dene d(I; K [x]) recursively by
• d(0; K [x]) = n,
d(I; K [x]) = max d(I j(xi =0) ; K[x r xi]) j xi jm1 .
Then d(I; K [x]) = dim(K [x]=I).
Proof Let u x be a maximal independent set for I . Then 
#u = dim(K [x]=I). If xi is a variable such that xijm1 and xi 2= u, 
then u is a maximal independent set for Ij(xi =0) K[xrxi].
For the vector space dimension dimK (K [x]=I), Proposition 2.55 
tells us to count the monomials not contained in L(I), provided 
this number is nite. Note, however, that it takes some eort to 
make this combinatorial approach an ecient one.
Singular Example 2.58 (Intersection Multiplicities) Reconsid­
ering Example 1.90 from Chapter 1, we show how to compute the 
intersection multiplicities of the curves C = V(f) and D = V(g), 
where f = y2 — x2 (x +1) and g = y2 + x3. The curves intersect in 
the points (0; 0); (-1, 4p2), (-2, -4p2). First, we compute the 
intersection multiplicity at o = (0; 0), that is,
io(C;D) = dimQ (Q[x;y]hx;yi = hf;gi).

> ideal I = y2-x3-x2,y2+x3;

2.3 Dimension and the Hilbert Function
95
Now we compute the sum of the intersection multiplicities in the 
three intersection points of the curves, that is, dimQ (Q[x; y]=hf; gi) 
(see Proposition 1.88).
> ring R2 = 0, (x,y), dp;
> 
ideal I = imap(R1,I);
> 
vdim(std(I));
6
This suggests that the intersection multiplicity at ( — 1; ± 4^/2) is 
1p. To test this, we consider the ring Q ( a) [x; y], where a = 
1=8. We create a map : Q (pa) [x; y] ! Q (pa) [x; y] cor­
responding to the morphism A2 (Q ( a)) ! A2 (Q ( a)) which
translates ( — 1; 4y/2) to o = (0; 0). The intersection multiplicity 
at ( — 2; 44V2) is, then:
dimQ(pa) ((Q(p/a) [x;y])hx;y}/MfW(g)i)
= dimQ(pa) ((Q (pa) [x;y])hx+2;y-1 p2i /hf;gi) •

f(1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (0; 0; 1)g. We compute the multiplicity of I at 
(1; 0; 0), that is,
mult((1; 0; 0) j I) = dimQ (Q[x; y; z^x-i^i/I) •
Consider the map : Q[x; y; z] ! Q[x; y; z] dened by (x) = 
x + 1; (y) = y; (z) = z. This corresponds to the morphism 
A3 (Q) ! A3 (Q) translating (1; 0; 0) to o = (0; 0; 0). We compute 
mult(o j ^(I)) = dimQ (Q.[x,y, z^x^/^I)) :

Now, we turn to the Hilbert function and the Hilbert polynomial.
Problem: If I K[x] is a homogeneous ideal, compute Q(t) 2 Z[t] 
such that HPK[x]=I (t) = Q(t) , where HPK[x]=I is the Hilbert{
K[x]=I\ 
(1 t)n 
K[x]=I
Poincare series of K [x]=I (see Theorem 1.108 in Section 1.2.4) and 
n is the number of variables in K [x].
Theorem 2.60 Let > be any monomial ordering on K [x], and 
let I K[x] be a homogeneous ideal. Then
HPK[x]=I (t) = HPK[x]=L(I)(t):
Proof Let K [x]d be the K {vector space generated by all mono­
mials of degree d, and let Id = I \ K[x]d; L(I)d = L(I) \ K[x]d. 
We have to prove that
dimK (K[x]d=Id) = dimK (K[x]d=L(I)d)
for all d. Let B := fm j m monomial, m 2= L(I); deg(m) = 
dg. We show that B represents a basis of both K [x]d=Id and 
K[x]d=L(I)d. Let G be a standard basis of I, and let h 2 K[x]d. 
Then weakNF(h j G) and weakNF(h j L(G)) are elements of K [x]d 
since weakNF preserves homogeneity. Iterating this process by 
computing the weakNF of the tail of weakNF(h j G) respectively 
weakNF(h j L(G)), we may assume weakNF(h j G) 2 m B Km 
and weakNF(h j L(G)) 2 m2B K m. But weakNF(h j G) = 0 
(respectively weakNF(h j L(G)) = 0) i h 2 I (respectively h 2 
L(I)). Hence, B represents a K {basis of both K [x]d=Id and 
K[x]d=L(I)d.

We obtain Q(t) = t6 — 2t3 + 1 since the output has to be inter­

This implies that the Hilbert{Poincare series of K[t; x; y; z]=I is
HPK[t,x,y,z]=I(t) = (1^t)4
Next, we write a procedure to compute the nominator Q(t) of the

2.4 Primary Decomposition and Radicals
In this section, we address the geometric problem of nding the 
irreducible components of an algebraic set by treating the more 
general algebraic concept of primary decomposition.
Denition 2.64 An ideal Q ( R of a ring R is a primary ideal 
if, for any a; b 2 R, ab 2 Q and a 2= Q imply b 2 Q.
It follows easily from the denition that the radical P = Q of 
a primary ideal Q is a prime ideal. We also say that Q is P { 
primary.
Denition 2.65 Let I ( R be an ideal of a ring R. A primary 
decomposition of I is a decomposition I = Q1 \ \ Qs into 
primary ideals Qi . A primapry decomposition is called irredun- 
dant if Pi = Qi 6= Pj = 
Qj for all i 6= j and no Qi can be
omitted.
Using the ascending chain condition, one can show that that every 
proper ideal I of a Noetherian ring has an irredundant primary 
decomposition I = Q1 \ ::: \ Qs. Moreover, the prime ideals 
Pi = Qi are uniquely determined by I . They are called the as­
sociated primes of I . We say that Pi is a minimal associated 
prime of I if Pi 6 Pj for all j 6= i. If A is an algebraic set with 
vanishing ideal I(A), then the minimal associated primes of I(A) 
dene precisely the irreducible components of A.
Problem: If I ( K [x] is a proper ideal, nd an irredundant pri­
mary decomposition I = Q1 \ 
\ Qs.

2.4 Primary Decomposition and Radicals
99
Solution: There are several algorithms to solve this problem (see 
[Decker et al. (1998)]). Here we will explain the algorithm of Gi­
anni, Trager, and Zacharias. This algorithm may require general 
coordinate changes which are guaranteed to exist in characteristic 
zero (see Proposition 2.68 below). The basic idea of the algorithm 
is to reduce the general case to the zero{dimensional case, and the 
zero{dimensional case to polynomial factorization. Note that if I 
is a zero{dimensional ideal, then the associated primes of I are 
maximal ideals.
Denition 2.66
(i) A maximal ideal M 
K[x1; : : : ; xn] is called in general
position with respect to the lexicographical ordering >lp 
with x1 > 
> xn if there exist g1;:::;gn 2 K[xn] with
M 
hx1 + gl (xn );:::; xn — 1 + g n — 1 (x n ) , gn (xn) i ■
(ii) A zero{dimensional ideal I 
K[x1 ; : : : ; xn] is called in
general position with respect to >lp with x1 > 
> xn
if all its associated primes P1 ; : : : ; Ps are in general position 
and Pi \ K [xn] 6= Pj \ K [xn] for i 6= j .
Example 2.67
(i) M = hx1 + x22 ; x23 + 2i 
Q[x1 ; x2] is a maximal ideal in
general position with respect to >lp with x1 > x2.
(ii) M = hx21 + 2; x22 + 7i 
Q[x1 ; x2] is a maximal ideal that is
not in general position.
Proposition 2.68 Let K be a eld of characteristic zero, and let 
I K [x] be a zero{dimensional ideal. Then there is a nonempty 
Zariski open subset U C K n-1 such that for all a = (ai ;:::;«n_i) 
2 U, the coordinate change a : K[x] ! K[x] dened by a(xi) = 
xi if i < n and
a(xn) = xn + 
aixi
i=1
has the property that a(I) is in general position with respect to 
>lp with x1 > 
> xn .

100
Computing
For a proof, see [Greuel and Pster (2007)]. The idea is the fol­
lowing: If M 
K [x] is a maximal ideal, then K [x]=M is a nite
eld extension of K generated by x1 = x1 + M; : : :; xn = xn + M. 
Using the theorem of the primitive element, it follows that almost 
all linear combinations of x1 ; : : : ; xn lead to a primitive element of 
the eld extension. The corresponding coordinate change yields 
the required shape of M.
Proposition 2.69 Let I K[x1;:::;xn] be a zero{dimensional 
ideal. Let hgi = I \ K[xn], g = g11 :::gss , gi monic and prime 
with gi 6= gj for i 6= j . Then
(i) I = Tis=1hI;giii.
If I is in general position with respect to >lp, x1 > 
> xn, then
(ii) hI;giii is a primary ideal for each i.
Proof The univariate polynomials
g(i) := g ; i= 1;:::;s;
gii

able ai 2 K[xn]. Let f 2 is=1 hI; gii i. Choose Pfi 2 I, bi 2 K[x] 
sPuch that f = fi + bigii for all i. Then f = is=1 aig(i) f =
is=1 aig(i)(fi + bigii) 2 I. This proves (i).
To prove (ii), x i. First note that hI; gii i 6= K [x]. Indeed, 
otherwise, f + c gii = 1 for some f 2 I, c 2 K [x], so f g(i) + 
c g = g(i) 2 I, impossible. Thus, each hI;giii is a proper zero{ 
dimensional ideal. Let P hI; gii i be a maximal ideal. Then P 
is an associated prime of I containing the irreducible polynomial 
gi. Since I is in general position with respect to >lp, P ips the only 
associated prime of I containing hI; gii i. Hence, P = hI;giii, 
and hI; gii i is primary since it is zero{dimensional.

Computing
Now, we reduce the general case to the zero{dimensional case:
Proposition 2.71 Let I ( K[x] be an ideal, and let u x be a 
maximal independent set of variables for I . Then:
(i) 
The ideal I K (u)[x r u] generated by I in K (u)[x r u] is 
zero{dimensional.
(ii) If fgi;::: ;gsg C I C K [x] is a Grdbner basis of IK (u)[x r 
u], and h := lcm LC(g1); : : : ; LC(gs) 2 K [u], then
I K (u)[x r u] \ K[x] = I : hh1i;
and this ideal is equidimensionaly of dimension dim(I).
(iii) IfI : hd = I : hd+1, then I = (I : hd) \ hI; hdi.
(iv) If I K (u)[x r u] = Q1 \ 
\ Qs is an irredundant primary
decomposition, then also
IK(u)[x r u] \ K[x] = (Q1 \ K[x]) \ 
\ (Qs \ K[x])
is an irredundant primary decomposition.
Proof For a proof, see [Greuel and Pster (2007)].
Example 2.72 Let I = hxy; xzi C Q[x; y; z]. Then:
u = fy; zg is a maximal independent set and IQ(y; z)[x] = 
hxiQ(y;z)[x] .
• fxyg C I is a Grobner basis of IQ(y; z)[x] and h = y.
I : h = I : h2 = hxiQ[x;y;z] and I = (I : h) \ hI; hi = 
hxi \ hxz; yi.
• 
We have to continue with hxz; yi =: J.
• 
u = fxg is a maximal independent set and J Q(x)[y; z] = 
hy; ziQ(x)[y;z] .
• fxz;yg C J is a Grobner basis of JQ(x)[y;z] and h = x.
• J : h = J : h2 = hy; ziQ[x;y;z] and J = (J : h) \ hJ; hi = 
hy;zi\ hx; yi.
• This implies I = hxi\ hy; zi \ hx; yi. Since hxi C hx; yi, we 
obtain I = hxi \ hy; zi.
Finally, we briey address the computation of the radical.
y That is, all associated primes of I have the same dimension dim(I).

Remark 2.75 As for primary decomposition, computing radicals 
in general can be reduced to the zero{dimensional case.
2.5 Buchberger's Algorithm and Field Extensions
Let L K be a eld extension such as K K . If I is an ideal of 
K [x1;:::; xn], then any Grobner basis for I is also a Grobner basis 
for the ideal generated by I in L[x1 ; : : : ; xn] since all computations 
in Buchberger's algorithm are carried through over K .
This shows, in particular, that if a property of ideals can be 
checked using Grobner bases, then I has this property iff the ideal 
generated by I in L[x1 ; : : : ; xn] has this property. To give an 
example, we know that elimination ideals can be computed using 
Grobner bases. It follows that if Ik is the kth elimination ideal 
of I, then the ideal generated by Ik in L[xk+1 ; : : : ; ; xn] is the kth 
elimination ideal of the ideal generated by I in L[x1; : : : ; xn].
See [Decker and Schreyer (2013)] for more on this.

Sudoku
In this chapter, we will explain how to solve a Sudoku using ideas 
from algebraic geometry and computer algebra. In fact, we will 
represent the solutions of a Sudoku as the points in the vanishing 
locus of a polynomial ideal I in 81 variables, and we will show that 
the unique solution of a well{posed Sudoku can be read o from 
the reduced Grobner basis of I. We should point out, however, 
that attacking a Sudoku can be regarded as a graph colouring
104 

Sudoku

problemy, with one colour for each of the numbers 1; : : :; 9, and 
that graph theoretical methods for solving the Suduko are much 
more efficient than Grobner basis methods.
A completed Sudoku is a particular example of what is called 
a Latin square. A Latin square of order n is an n n square grid 
whose entries are taken from a set of n dierent symbols, with each 
symbol appearing exactly once in each row and each column. For 
a Sudoku, usually n = 9, and the symbols are the numbers from 
1 to 9. In addition to being a Latin square, a completed Sudoku 
is sub ject to the condition that each number from 1 to 9 appears 
exactly once in each of the nine distinguished 3 3 blocks.
Latin squares can be at least traced back to the medieval islamic 
world. They appear in the work of Leonhard Euler who created 
examples using Latin characters. The invention of the modern 
Sudoku is credited to the US-American architect Howard Garns. 
Examples where rst published by Dell Magazines in 1979 under 
the name Number Place. The name Sudoku was coined in Japan 
where the puzzles became popular in the mid 1980s.
To model a Sudoku by polynomial equations, we represent its 
81 cells by 81 variables, say x1;:::;x81. Then the entry ai in 
the ith cell of a completed Sudoku satises ai 2 f1; : : :; 9g i 
ai is a root of the univariate polynomial Fi 2 Q[xi] dened by 
Fi(xi) 
11 k=i(xi _ k). The polynomial Fi(xi) — Fj(xj-) vanishes
on V(xi — Xj), so that xi — xj is a factor of Fi(xi) — Fj(xj), for 
i 6= j . In other words, we have well{dened polynomials
. x 
Fi - Fj 
. 
. . , .
Gij (xi; xj ) = 
2 Q[xi; xj ]; i 6= j:
xi — xj-
The condition that neither a row, nor a column, nor a distin­
guished 3 3 block in a completed Sudoku has repeated entries is 
modelled as follows. Set
E = f(i; j ) j 1 i < j 81; and the ith and jth cell are in the 
same row, column, or distinguished 3 x 3 — blockg:
Let I Q[xi;:::;x8i] be the ideal which is generated by the 891 
polynomials Fi , i = 1; : : : ; 81, and Gij , (i; j) 2 E.
y A famous example of a graph colouring problem is the four{colour problem 
which was solved by Appel and Hagen in 1976 with a computer{assisted 
proof. See [Appel and Haken (1977)].

106
Sudoku
Proposition 3.1 With notation as above, let V(I) be the vanish­
ing locus of I in A81(Q), and let a = (a1;:::; a81) 2 A81 (Q) be a 
point. Then a 2 V(I) i ai 2 f1; : : :; 9g, for i = 1; : : : ; 81, and 
ai 6= aj, for (i; j) 2 E.
Proof If the conditions on the right hand side are fullled, then 
the Fi and Gij vanish at a, so that a 2 V(I). Conversely, let 
a 2 V(I). Then Fi (a) = 0 and, thus, ai 2 f1;:::;9g for all i. 
To show that ai 6= aj for (i; j) 2 E, suppose to the contrary that 
ai = aj =: b for some (i; j). Since substituting b for xj in Fi (xi) = 
(xi xj )Gij (xi ; xj ) + Fj (xj ) gives Fi (xi ) 
(xi b)Gij (xi ; b), and
since Gij (b; b) = 0 by assumption, this would imply that b is a 
zero of Fi of order at least two, which is impossible.
We say that a Sudoku is well{posed if it has a unique solution.
Proposition 3.2 Let S be an explicitly given, well{posed Su­
doku with preassigned numbers faigi2L , for some subset L 
f 1;:::; 81g. We associate to S the ideal Is = I + hfxi — aigi2Li. 
Then, with respect to any global monomial ordering, the reduced 
Grobner basis of Is has the shape xi — ai ,...,x8i — a8i, and 
(a1 ; : : : ; a81) is the solution of the Sudoku.
Proof Taking Proposition 3.1 and the Nullstellensatz into account, 
the assumption that S has a unique solution (ai ; : : : ; a8i ) implies 
that y/IS is the maximal ideal hx1 — ai,... ,x81 — a81i. In partic­
ular, IS contains a suitable power of xi — ai, for each i. Since IS 
also contains the square{free polynomials Fi(xi) = k=1 (xi — k), 
we conclude that the elimination ideals IS \ K [xi] are generated 
by the xi — ai. Thus, IS = hx1 — ai,... ,x81 — a81i, and the shape 
of the reduced Grobner basis is as claimed. 
□
Based on the discussion above, we present Singular procedures 
to solve a Sudoku. The rst step is to create the set E , the 
polynomials Fi , and the ideal generated by the polynomials Fi and 
Gij , respectively. This is done by the following three procedures: 

Sudoku
107
proc createE() 
{
int i,j,k,l,a,b;
list E;
for(j = 1; j <= 9; j++) 
{
for(k =1; k <= 9; k++) 
{
i = (j-1)*9+k;
a = j mod 3; if(a == 0) { a = 3; }
b = k mod 3; if(b == 0) { b = 3; } 
for(l = k+1; l <= 9; l++)
{ 
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,i+l-k);
}
for(l = j+4-a; l <= 9; l++) 
{
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,(l-1)*9+k);
}
if(a != 3) 
{
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,j*9+k-b+1);
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,j*9+k-b+2);
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,j*9+k-b+3);
}
if(a == 1) 
{
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,(j+1)*9+k-b+1);
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,(j+1)*9+k-b+2);
E[size(E)+1] = list(i,(j+1)*9+k-b+3); 
}
}
}
return(E);
} 
proc createF()
{
int i;
ideal F;
poly p = (var(1)-1);
for(i = 2; i <= 9; i++) 
{
p = p*(var(1)-i);
}
F[1] = p;

108
Sudoku
for(i = 2; i <= nvars(basering); i++)
{
F[i] = subst(p,var(1),var(i));
}
return(F);
}
proc createG(ideal F, list E)
{
int i;
ideal G = F;
for(i = 1; i <= size(E); i++)
{
G[size(G)+1] = (F[E[i][1]] - F[E[i][2]])/ 
(var(E[i][1]) - var(E[i][2]));
}
return(G);
}
Starting from the ideal created so far, the next step is to im­
plement the ideal IS from Proposition 3.2. That is, we have to 
include the polynomials which encode the preassigned values of 
the Sudoku. We suppose that these values are given in form of 
a 9 9 integer matrix, where cells with no preassigned value are 
represented by a zero.
proc addPreass(ideal G, intmat M) 
{
int i,j,k;
for(i = 1; i <= 9; i++)
{
for(j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
{
if(M[i,j] != 0)
{
k = (i-1)*9+j;
G[size(G)+1] = var(k)-M[i,j];
}
}
}
return(G);
}
The procedure below reads the solution of the Sudoku from the 
reduced Grobner basis for the ideal IS, which is required as input: 

Sudoku
109
proc prepareRes(ideal G) // G a Groebner basis 
{
intmat M[9][9];
int i,j,k;
for(i = 1; i <= size(G); i++) 
{
j = ((i-1) div 9) +1;
k = i mod 9;
if(k == 0) { k = 9; }
M[j,k] = int(leadcoef(-G[size(G)-i+1][2]));
}
return(M);
}
Finally, we present the main procedure which calls all procedures 
dened above:
proc Sudoku(intmat M) 
{
list E = createE();
ring R = 32003, x(1..81), dp;
ideal F = createF();
ideal G = createG(F,E);
G = addPreass(G,M);
option(redSB);
G = std(G);
intmat N = prepareRes(G);
return(N);
}

Singular session, the Sudoku in Figure 3.1 is solved as follows:

A Problem in Group Theory Solved by 
Computer Algebra
We shall briey report on the paper [Bandman et al. (2006)] in 
which a problem in nite group theory could be translated to 
algebraic geometry and solved using computer algebra. We begin 
by collecting some facts about nilpotent and solvable groups.
4.1 Finite Groups and Thompson's Theorem
As usual, if G is any group (in multiplicative notation, with iden­
tity element 1), we write [x; y] = xyx 1y 1 for the commutator 
of two elements x; y 2 G, and
[G; G] = h[x; y] jx;y2Gi
for the commutator subgroup of G.
Denition 4.1 Let G be a group. Inductively, dene subgroups 
of G by G1 := [G; G] and Gi+1 := [Gi; G]. Then G is called 
nilpotent if Gm = f1g for some natural number m 1.
Example 4.2
(i) Abelian groups are nilpotent.
(ii) A nite group G is nilpotent i it is the direct product of 
its Sylow subgroups. A proof of this theorem can be found, 
for instance, in [Doerk and Hawkes (1992)].
(iii) The symmetric group S3 is not nilpotent since [S3 ; S3] is 
the alternating group A3 , and [A3 ; S3] = A3.
Let us illustrate (iii) and (ii) with a Sage session:
111

112 A Problem in Group Theory Solved by Computer Algebra
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: G
Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group
sage: H = G.commutator(G)
sage: H
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3)]
sage: H == AlternatingGroup(3)
True
sage: L=H.commutator(G)
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3)]
Thus, [S3; S3] = A3 and [A3; S3] = A3 as claimed in (iii). To give 
an example for (ii), consider the dihedral Group D4:
sage: D4 = DihedralGroup(4)
sage: D4.cardinality()
8
sage: G = D4.commutator(D4)
sage: G
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3)(2,4)]
sage: G.commutator(D4)
Permutation Group with generators [()]
This shows that [[D4; D4]; D4] = f1g, so that D4 is nilpotent. 
Since D4 has order 8, it is itself a 2{Sylow group.
Denition 4.3 Let G be a group. Inductively, dene subgroups 
of G by G(1) := [G; G] and G(i+1) := [G(i); G(i)]. Then G is called 
solvable if G(m) = f1g for some natural number m 1.
Example 4.4
(i) 
Any nilpotent group G is solvable since G(i) 
Gi for all i.
(ii) S3 , S4 are solvable since [S3; S3] = A3 , [S4; S4] = A4 .
(iii) 
Groups of odd order are solvable.y
(iv) S5 , A5 are not solvable since [A5; A5] = A5, [S5; S5] = A5 .
We show how to check (iv) and (ii) using Sage:
sage: S5 = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: S5.commutator(S5)
y This is the theorem of Feit and Thompson which is a very important result 
for the classication of nite groups. The proof has more than 300 pages. 
See [Feit and Thompson (1963)].

4.1 Finite Groups and Thompson's Theorem
113
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3), (1,3,4), (1,5,4)] 
sage: S5.commutator(S5) == AlternatingGroup(5)
True
sage: A5 = AlternatingGroup(5)
sage: A5.commutator(A5)
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3,4), (2,4,5)]
sage: A5.commutator(A5).order()
60
This shows that [S5; S5] = A5 and [A5; A5] = A5.
sage: S4 = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: G = S4.commutator(S4)
sage: G
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3), (1,3,4)]
sage: H = G.commutator(G)
sage: H
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,4), (1,4)(2,3)]
sage: H.commutator(H)
Permutation Group with generators [()]
This shows that S4 is solvable.
Denition 4.5 Let K be a eld. We write
SL(n; K) := fM 2 GL(n;K) j det(M) = 1g
for the special linear group and
PSL(n; K) := SL(n; K)fa En jan = 1g
for the projective special linear group. If K = Fq , we also 
write PSL(n; q) = PSL(n; Fq).
Example 4.6 We use Sage to check that
PSL(2; 5) = PSL(2; 4) = A5 :
sage: G = PSL(2,5)
sage: G
Permutation Group with generators [(3,5)(4,6), (1,2,5)(3,4,6)]
sage: H = PSL(2,4)
sage: H
Permutation Group with generators [(3,4,5), (1,2,3)]
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)
True
sage: G.is_isomorphic(A5)

114 A Problem in Group Theory Solved by Computer Algebra
True
We need a classication result proved in [Thompson (1968)]:
Theorem 4.7 The nite nonsolvable simple groups all whose 
proper subgroups are solvable are containedy in the following list:
(i) PSL(2; q), q = pn 4, p a prime.
(ii) PSL(3; 3).
(iii) Sz(2n), n 3 and odd, the Suzuki groups.
Remark 4.8 The Suzuki groups can be represented as follows.
Let n = 2m + 1, and let q = 2n. Consider the automorphism 
0 : Fq —! Fq, 0(a) = a2m+1. We have 02(a) = a2, that is, % is the 
square root of the Frobenius map. Let
U(a;b) =
1 
0 00
a 
1 00
a(a)+b

'000 c 1 2m

Then Sz(q) = hU(a;b);M(c);T ja;b;c2Fq; c6= 0i 
SL(4;Fq).
4.2 Characterization of Finite Solvable Groups
Now, we consider the following problem: Use 2{variable identities 
to characterize the nite groups that are solvable. As a motiva­
tion, we recall other characterizations by 2{variable identities:
Example 4.9
(i) A group G is abelian i xy = yx for all x;y 2 G.
(ii) If G is a group and x;y 2 G, inductively set v1 (x; y) := 
[x; y] and vn+1 (x; y) := [vn; y]. Then a nite group G is 
nilpotent i there is an integer n 1 such that vn (x; y) = 1 
for all x;y 2 G (Engel Identities). See [Zorn (1936)].
y The list contains more groups than Thompson's list, but is easier to de­
scribe.

4.2 Characterization of Finite Solvable Groups
115
To characterize nite solvable groups, we introduce Engel{like 
identities which, as shown by Theorem 4.12 below, are just right:
Notation 4.10 If G is a group and x; y 2 G, inductively dene 
6i(x, y) := x 2 ■ y 1 ■ x and
en+i(x;y) := [x ■ en(x,y) ■ x^.y ■ en(x,y) ■ y-1].
Remark 4.11 We may think of e1 as a word in x. x 1. y, and 
y 1. Given any such word w, set eW(x.y) := w and inductively 
eW+i(x.y) := [x ■ eW(x.y) ■ x ' >y ■ eW(x.y) ■ y 1 . The choice 
of w = x 2y 1x was motivated by a computer search among 
the 10000 shortest words w, asking whether the condition from 
Proposition 4.13 below holds for all q < 1000, with enW (x. y) in 
place of en(x.y). The words found were x 2y 1 x, x 1yxy 1x, 
y 2x 1, and xy 2x 1yx 1.
Theorem 4.12 A nite group G is solvable i there is an integer 
n 1 such that en (x. y) = 1 for all x. y 2 G.
Referring to [Bandman et al. (2006)] for the complete proof, 
we illustrate the main idea here. First, if G is solvable, then the 
identities en(x. y) = 1 are satised from a certain n onward.
Second, assume that the converse implication of the theorem is 
not true, and let G be a counterexample of minimal order. That 
is, G is a nite nonsolvable group of the smallest order such that 
en(x. y) = 1 for some n and all x. y 2 G. Then G must be simple. 
Indeed, otherwise, there is a nontrivial proper normal subgroup 
H of G, and both H and G=H would be solvable (because the 
identity en = 1 remains true in the subgroups and the quotients). 
This would imply that G is solvable.
The idea now is to show that for each group G in Thompson's 
list, there are x.y 2 G with e1 (x.y) = e2(x.y) and y = x 1. This 
implies 1 6= e1 (x. y) = en(x. y) for all n.
For PSL(3. 3), it turned out that there are 44928 suitable pairs 
in x. y having this property. One of them is

116 A Problem in Group Theory Solved by Computer Algebra
In what follows, we shall give an idea on how to deal with the 
groups PSL(2; q) (the case of the Suzuki groups is much more 
dicult and can therefore not be treated here).
Here is what we wish to show:
Proposition 4.13 If q = pn for a prime p and q 6= 2; 3, then
there are X;y in PSL(2;q) with y = x 1 and ei(x;y) = e2(x;y).
The proof of the proposition is based on explicit computations 
with the following matrices: If R is any ring, and if t; b; c 2 R, set
x(t) := 1t
-1\0;
y(b; c) :=
1 +bbc 2SL(2;R):
We study the case R = Z for simultaneous verication in the 
cases R = Fp , for all primes p. This is even sucient for the 
cases q = pn since the ideals introduced below are dened over 
FpFqFq=Fp.
Let I Z[b; c; t] be the ideal generated by the four entries of 
the matrix ei(x(t),y(b, c)) — e2(x(t);y(b; c)) 2 SL(2;Z). We use 
Singular to obtain generators for I :

Having, in fact, implemented an ideal in Q[x; y; z], we compute a
Grobner basis of this ideal using option(contentSB):

Note that option(contentSB) forces Singular to perform the 
usual Buchberger algorithm over Q without any division. Techni­
cally, this amounts to replacing spoly(f; g) by LC(g) spoly(f; g) 
(see Denition 2.19). Starting from generators dened over Z, the 
reductions of the resulting Grobner basis elements modulo p form 
a Grobner basis over Fp, for all primes p not dividing any of the 
leading coecients. In our case, where all leading coecients are 
1, we get a Grobner basis for the ideal I Fq [b; C; t], for all q = pn 
(here, IFq [b; c; t] is the ideal induced by I in Fq [b; c; t] via reducing 
the generators modulo p and extending from Fp to Fq). In par­
ticular, the dimension is 1 in all cases, so that I Fq [b; C; t] denes 
a curve C(q) in A3 (Fq), for all q. We are interested in the Fq{ 
rational points of C(q) , that is, in the points with coordinates 
in Fq . In fact, to show Proposition 4.13, it is sucient to prove:
Proposition 4.14 With notation as above, let q be as in Propo­
sition 4.13. Then C(q) contains at least one Fq {rational point.
To establish this result, we apply the Hasse{Weil theorem as gen­
eralized in [Aubry and Perret (1996)] to possibly singular curves:
Theorem 4.15 Let C An (Fq) be an irreducible ane curve 
dened by polynomial equations with coecients in Fq , and let 
C Pn(Fq) be its projective closure. Then the number of Fq{ 
rational points of C is at least q + 1 — 2pap/q — d, where d and pa 
are the degree and the arithmetic genus of C, respectively.
Remark 4.16
(i) By their very denition, d and pa can be read o from the 
Hilbert polynomial Pc(t) = dt — pa + 1 of C. Hence, these 
numbers can be computed directly from the vanishing ideal 

118 A Problem in Group Theory Solved by Computer Algebra
of C { no information on the singularities of C is needed. 
See Remark 1.107 and Section 2.3.
(ii) Theorem 4.15 is an ane version of the Hasse{Weil theo­
rem which can be derived from the projective version stated 
in [Aubry and Perret (1996)] by taking into account that 
the number of points of C contained in a hyperplane is at 
most d. See again Remark 1.107.
(iii) The fact that C is irreducible in the ane space over the 
algebraic closure of its eld of denition is sometimes em­
phasized by saying that C is absolutely irreducible.
The next result will allow us to apply Theorem 4.15 in our sit­
uation. To state the result, we x a prime power q = pn as in 
Proposition 4.13, and denote by L the algebraic closure L = Fq.
Proposition 4.17 With notation as above, IL[b; c; t] is a prime 
ideal. Geometrically, the curve C(q) is absolutely irreducible.
To prove this result, we rst verify:
Lemma 4.18 We have IL(t)[b; c] = hf1 ; f2i, with
f1 = t2b4 - t3(t - 2)b3 + (-t5 + 3t4 - 2t3 + 2t + 1)b2
+ t2(t2 - 2t - 1)(t - 2)b +(t2 - 2t - 1)2;
f2 = t(t2 - 2t - 1)c + t2b3 + (-t4 + 2t3)b2
+ ( 
t5 + 3t4 2t3 + 2t + 1)b + (t5 
4t4 + 3t3 + 2t2):
“+ ( 
“+ 
“+ + “+ 
) “+ 
( 
+ “+ + 
“+ 
) :
Moreover, IL[b,c,t] = hfi;f2i : h2, with h = t(t2 — 2t — 1).
Proof We continue our Singular session to check this:
> ring S = (0,t), (c,b), lp;
> ideal I = imap(R,I); I = std(I); I; 
I[1]=(t7+t6-t5-2t4-t3)*b4+ ...
I[2]=(t8-2t7-4t6+6t5+7t4-6t3-8t2-2t)*c+(t6+t5-t4-2t3-t2)*b4+ ...
Since we did not allow any division during the Grobner basis com­
putation, we now simplify the Grobner basis “by hand":
> I[1]=I[1]/(t5+t4-t3-2t2-t); 
I[2]=I[2]-(t4+t3-t2-2t-1)*I[1];
> I[2]=I[2]/(t5-3t3+4t+2); I;

Proof of Proposition 4.17 We have to show that IL[b; c; t] is a 
prime ideal. For this, relying on a Singular computation as 
above, one rst checks that I : h = I. Taking Lemma 2.71, (ii) 
into account, this implies that
IL(t)[b; c] \ L[b; c; t] = hf1; f2i : h2 = IL[b; c; t]:
Therefore, it is enough to prove that IL(t)[b; c] is a prime ideal 
or, equivalently, that f1 is irreducible in L(t)[b]y. This, in turn, is 
equivalent to proving that f1 is irreducible in L[t; b]. Let P (t; x) := 
t2f1 (t; x=t). Then
P(t; x) = x4 — t2 (t — 2)x3 + (—t5 + 3t4 — 2t3 + 2t + 1)x2
+ t3(t - 2)(t2 - 2t - 1)x + t2(t2 - 2t - 1)2:
We visualize the real curve dened by the polynomial P :
y In L(t)[b; c], the polynomial f2 is linear in c, whereas f1 does not depend 
on c. Hence, L(t)[b; c]=I = L(t)[b]hf1 i.

120 A Problem in Group Theory Solved by Computer Algebra
The irreducibility of f1 in L[t; b] follows from that of P in L[x; t]. 
For the latter, we rst show that P is not divisible by any factor 
of x{degree 2. We make the following ansatz:
P = (x2 + ax + b) (x2 + gx + d); 
(4.1)
where a; b; g; d are polynomials in t with indeterminates a(i), 
b(i), g(i), d(i) as coecients. It is easy to see that we can 
assume
deg(b) 
5; deg(a) 
3; deg(d) 
3; deg(g) 
2;
so that only nitely many coecients need to be considered. Then 
a decomposition (4.1) with coecients in L does not exist i the 
ideal J of the coefficients in x; t of P — (x2 +ax+b)(x2 + gx+d) has 
no solution in L, that is, if a Grobner basis of J contains 1 2 Fp. In 
checking this using Singular, we skip the computation to create 
J over Z and give just the result (we print [...] to indicate that 
part of the output is omitted).
>J;
J[1]=-b(5)*d(3)

4.2 Characterization of Finite Solvable Groups 121
This shows, in fact, that over Z and, thus, over each Fq , we have
X24
4= 
M[i; 1] J[i]:
i=1
We conclude that if p 6= 2, then the polynomial P has no quadratic 
factor over L = Fp . Similarly, one can show that it has no linear 
factor. This implies that P is absolutely irreducible in Fp[t; x] for 
all p 6= 2. The case p = 2 can be treated similarly.
Now, having proved Theorem 4.17, we apply it show Theorem 
4.14 and, thus, Theorem 4.13. For this, continuing our Singular 
session, we compute the Hilbert polynomial PC (q) (t).
> ring T = 0, (b,c,t,w), dp;
> ideal I = imap(R,I);
> ideal SI = std(I); SI;
SI[1]=bct-t2+2t+1
SI[2]=bt3-ct3+t4-b2t+bct-c2t-2bt2+2ct2-3t3+bc+t2+t+1 
SI[3]=b2c2-b2ct+bc2t-bct2+b2+2bc+c2-b+c-t+2
SI[4]=c2t3-ct4+c3t-2c2t2+3ct3-t4-bc2+bt2-2ct2+4t3-2bt+ct-3t2-b-2t
Arguing as earlier, we see that SI induces a Grobner basis of 
IFq [b;C;t;W], for all q. Homogenizing the Grobner basis elements 
with respect to w, we get generators for the homogenized ideal 
Ih Fq [b; c; t; w] = (IFq [b; c; t; w])h (see Lemma 2.50). In fact, as it 
easy to see, in the case of >dp, the homogenized Grobner basis ele­
ments form a Grobner basis for the homogenized ideal. Therefore, 
the Hilbert polynomial is the same for all q:
> SI = homog(SI,w);
> hilbPoly(SI); // the Hilbert polynomial is 10t - 11 
-11,10
Proof of Proposition 4.14 From the Hilbert polynomial, we get 
the degree d = 10 and the arithmetic genus pa = 12. Using 
Theorem 4.15, we obtain:
#(C(q) \ A3(Fq)) > q + 1 - 24pq - 10:
This implies that C(q) has at least one Fq {rational point if q > 593. 
For the nitely many remaining cases, the existence of such a point 
can be checked by a brute force computer search.
