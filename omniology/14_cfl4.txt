The Pumping Lemma for CFL’s
Statement
Applications

2
Intuition
Recall the pumping lemma for regular 
languages.
It told us that if there was a string long 
enough to cause a cycle in the DFA for 
the language, then we could “pump” 
the cycle and discover an infinite 
sequence of strings that had to be in 
the language.

3
Intuition – (2)
For CFL’s the situation is a little more 
complicated.
We can always find two pieces of any 
sufficiently long string to “pump” in 
tandem.
That is: if we repeat each of the two pieces 
the same number of times, we get another 
string in the language.

Statement of the CFL Pumping 
Lemma
For every context-free language L
There is an integer n, such that
For every string z in L of length > n
There exists z = uvwxy such that:
1. |vwx| < n.
2. |vx| > 0.
3. For all i > 0, uviwxiy is in L.

5
Proof of the Pumping Lemma
Start with a CNF grammar for L – {ε}.
Let the grammar have m variables.
Pick n = 2m.
Let z, of length > n, be in L.
We claim (“Lemma 1 ”) that a parse 
tree with yield z must have a path of 
length m+2 or more.

6
Proof of Lemma 1
If all paths in the parse tree of a CNF 
grammar are of length < m+1, then the 
longest yield has length 2m-1, as in:
m variables
one terminal
2m-1 terminals

7
Back to the Proof of the 
Pumping Lemma
Now we know that the parse tree for z 
has a path with at least m+1 variables.
Consider some longest path.
There are only m different variables, so 
among the lowest m+1 we can find two 
nodes with the same label, say A.
The parse tree thus looks like:

Using the Pumping Lemma
{0i10i | i > 1} is a CFL.
We can match one pair of counts.
But L = {0i10i10i | i > 1} is not.
We can’t match two pairs, or three counts 
as a group.
Proof using the pumping lemma.
Suppose L were a CFL.
Let n be L’s pumping-lemma constant.

13
Using the Pumping Lemma – (2)
Consider z = 0n10n10n.
We can write z = uvwxy, where      
|vwx| < n, and |vx| > 1.
Case 1: vx has no 0’s.
Then at least one of them is a 1, and uwy 
has at most one 1, which no string in L 
does.

14
Using the Pumping Lemma – (3)
Still considering z = 0n10n10n.
Case 2: vx has at least one 0.
vwx is too short (length < n) to extend to 
all three blocks of 0’s in 0n10n10n.
Thus, uwy has at least one block of n 0’s, 
and at least one block with fewer than n 
0’s.
Thus, uwy is not in L.
