Acknowledgments
I would like to thank all of my friends who helped in the writing of this book through 
their patience, moral support, and sometimes, even technical support. It was great to 
hear their “You can do it!” encouragements whenever I was in need of hearing such 
words.
A Romanian “Multumesc!” goes to Alexandru Muntean, Alexandru Orbescu, and the 
7 Tutorials team. They all have been very active helpers and true friends. Without them, 
some of the pages in this book would have been inished at a much slower pace.
A French “Merci!” goes to both my sister and my girlfriend. Their love and subtle support 
did wonders for keeping my energy levels up as I worked on the book.
Last but not least, I would like to thank Ken Brown, the senior editor on this project. He’s 
been a really great guy to work with. We had an outstanding collaboration, and I can’t 
wait for us to hopefully work together on future projects.

Introducing Home Networking
In a modern home, it is no longer unusual for family members to own multiple comput-
ers and network devices. In most houses, you can ind at least a desktop computer, which 
is generally used for more performance-intensive tasks such as gaming or professional 
work of any kind. Parents bring home their work laptops or notebooks, which they use to 
connect to their business network and do a bit of work outside the ofice, when needed. 
Children also have their own systems, usually a mobile computer that they can easily take 
to school or university. All of these computers probably have different operating systems, 
depending on the year when they were purchased and the preference of each person. 
Some family members might be Windows users, while others might prefer the Mac com-
puters from Apple. Some people who are very fond of free software might use the latest 
version of Ubuntu Linux. In addition to computers, a family may own other devices such 
as printers, scanners, consoles, mobile phones with network connectivity via Bluetooth 
wireless, and so on.
With the help of a router and a few network cables, you can create your own home 
network and connect all these computers and devices together. The list of advantages for 
doing so is very long and includes:
 
●The possibility to easily exchange data between all computers and devices.
 
●Sharing devices between all the computers on the home network. For example, you 
can share the home’s printer or an external hard disk drive that everyone can use to 
back up their most important data, and so on.
 
●Media streaming between computers.
 
●Paying for only one Internet connection and sharing it with all the computers and 
devices on your network.
 
●Wireless access to the network and the Internet throughout your entire house.
 
●Playing multiplayer games via your home network.
This book covers all you need to know about setting up your home network and taking 
advantage of all its capabilities. Included in the book are chapters about setting up and 
using the networking features in Windows 7, making different operating systems work 
together on the network, and streaming your media over the network and the Internet. 
It also covers sharing devices in the network, the tools and features you need to use to 
keep your network secure, and setting up parental controls for your children. Last but not 
least, it also provides guidance on how to troubleshoot network and Internet problems 
by yourself. 

xviii  Introducing Home Networking
Operating Systems Covered in the Book
This book is focused mostly on Windows 7 and shows how to use the network-related 
features included in this operating system. However, there are dedicated sections that 
cover network interoperability between Windows 7 and the following operating systems: 
Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service Pack 2, Mac OS X v10.6 (Snow Leopard), 
and Ubuntu Linux v10.10 (Maverick Meerkat).
Assumptions
The exercises in this book assume that you know the basics of computing and that some 
of your computers have Windows 7 already installed and conigured. The exercises do 
not cover Windows 7 installation and personalization tasks. They dive directly into net-
working features and coniguration settings.
This book explains how to install, conigure, and manage a home network setup similar 
to the one shown in the following diagram.

Introducing Home Networking  xix
In your home, there are several computers (desktops and laptops or notebooks), each 
with an operating system installed and all connected to the router. Also, there are several 
external devices (such as printers, scanners, and so on) connected to any of the comput-
ers in your network that you would like to share with the network.
Minimum System Requirements
To run Windows 7 and work your way through the exercises in this book, your computer 
must meet certain speciications.

As soon as you have Windows 7 installed and personalized on your computers, it’s time 
to install the appropriate software and drivers for the hardware devices that you’ll need 
to use: printers, network cards, keyboards and mice, mobile phones that you want to 
connect to your computers, and so on. Once this is all done, it is time to begin setting up 
your home network. The irst step is to install and conigure your router so that all your 
home computers can access each other and also share the same Internet connection.
In this chapter, you will learn how to manage and interact with hardware devices via the 
Device Stage feature in Windows 7 and how to install and conigure your router.
Practice Files You won’t need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this chapter.
Installing Hardware and Drivers
Once the operating systems are installed and conigured on all your computers, you 
need to conigure your hardware properly, especially the devices used for your home 
network—such as wired and wireless network cards, the router, cable connections, print-
ers, and so on. 
Make sure that you install the drivers for all your network cards, including both Ethernet-
based and wireless cards. The Ethernet network cards are used to connect to the network 
via cable while the wireless network cards are used on your notebooks (or netbooks) to 
connect to the network via wireless signals.

2 
 Chapter 1 Setting Up a Router and Devices
In most cases, Windows 7 will automatically detect the network cards and install drivers 
for them. However, it is best to install the latest driver version, either from the media 
provided by the manufacturer of the network card (as part of the packaging) or from the 
manufacturer’s Web site.
If the correct drivers are installed, Windows 7 should be able to connect properly both 
via cable and wireless. 
See Also  If you experienced problems connecting to the network or the Internet, refer to 
Chapter 15, “Troubleshooting Network and Internet Problems.”
If you have other devices such as printers, scanners, phones, webcams, and so on, ensure 
that you connect them to the appropriate computers and install the correct drivers. 
Again, search the media provided by the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s Web site 
for the latest driver versions. 
Important You should only install drivers that are speciically designated for the operating 
system you are using. For example, don’t install Windows XP drivers on computers that are 
running Windows 7, or vice-versa. This will surely crash your computer and cause further 
problems. Also, be careful to install 32-bit drivers for 32-bit operating systems and 64-bit 
drivers for 64-bit operating systems. 
Interacting with External Devices Through 
Device Stage
Device Stage is a feature that aims to provide a friendly way of interacting with external 
devices connected to your computer. It can be accessed through the Devices And Printers 
panel in Windows 7 and provides a single location for managing your external devices. 
Unfortunately, this feature depends a lot on the drivers and support that are available 
for each device. Most new devices are compatible with Windows 7 and their drivers 
take advantage of Device Stage, providing beneits such as allowing you to completely 
manage them from the Devices and Printers panel. You can do everything you need from 
within one convenient window: see the status of devices, view information about them, 
share devices over the network, change their settings, synchronize them with your PC 
(for example, mobile phones), conigure or use features of the device, perform trouble-
shooting, etc.

 
Interacting with External Devices Through Device Stage  3
For older devices that cannot take advantage of this feature, Windows 7 still allows you 
to modify a basic set of coniguration options and troubleshoot problems that might 
arise. While you might not enjoy all the beneits of a device that is fully compatible with 
Windows 7, it’s still better than searching for hidden administrative tools and guessing 
where to go to change the device settings. 
Finding the Device Stage
Device Stage is the oficial name of the feature but cannot be found under this 
name in Windows 7. In the operating system, it is actually named Devices and Printers, 
and by default, its shortcut can be found on the right side of the Start Menu.

 Chapter 1 Setting Up a Router and Devices
Alternatively, you can go to Control Panel -> Hardware And Sound -> Devices And 
Printers.
Devices Included in Device Stage
Device Stage shows your own computer plus the external devices connected to it. 
The list of devices includes mobile phones, portable music players, digital cameras, 
webcams, monitors, keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, Bluetooth adapters, exter-
nal hard drives, media extenders, and network devices connected to your computer.
Devices Excluded from Device Stage
Device Stage will not show devices that are a part of the base components of your 
computer (those that are inside your computer case). This means that you will not 
see internal hard disk drives, CD/DVD/Blu-ray drives, sound cards, video cards, 
memory, processors, internal modems, internal network cards, and so on.

 
Interacting with External Devices Through Device Stage  5
Some external devices are not included, as well. A couple of common examples 
include your speakers or an older mouse and keyboard.
Examples of Device Stage Usage Scenarios
What exactly you can do with a device that’s listed in Devices and Printers depends 
on the level of support for Windows 7 that the manufacturer of the device provides. 
For example, when I access my Microsoft Digital Media Keyboard, I can quickly con-
igure it, get support for issues, register it, or even access a guide for healthy com-
puting practices.
If I right-click the same keyboard, I quickly have access to coniguration options 
such as the Region and Language used when typing.

 Chapter 1 Setting Up a Router and Devices
For my old HP Photosmart C5200 printer, I have a small but useful set of options. 
From within its Devices and Printers window, I can quickly see how many iles there 
are in the printing queue, if the printer is ready or not, and what the default setting 
for page size and orientation is.
I also have options for changing the printing properties and getting support for my 
device.

 
Preparing to Install and Conigure a Router  7
For newer models of printers, you have more options available.
Preparing to Install and Conigure a Router
Installing and coniguring your router is the most complex and important activity in 
setting up your home network. This device is used to connect the entire home network 
to your Internet service provider. Therefore, it must have the correct settings if it is to 
connect without problems. Once the router setup is complete, you must conigure the 
settings of your home network so that all computers can connect to the router and the 
Internet. Lastly, you need to enable the wireless capability and conigure it so that all 
notebooks and netbooks can connect to the home network.
Coniguring the router depends a lot on the manufacturer and the speciic model you 
have. There is no universal method for coniguring a router, as each producer uses a 
different approach. Therefore, carefully read the user manual while going through this 
procedure. While you progress through the coniguration, pay attention to the following 
details:

 Chapter 1 Setting Up a Router and Devices
 
●Internet WAN (Wide Area Network) settings All of these settings are obtained 
from your Internet service provider (ISP) and are used to connect your home network 
to the Internet. You might need to contact your ISP to gather information you need 
to conigure your router’s connection to the Internet.
 
●Connection type What kind of connection will you be using? The most common 
connection types are the following: 
 
❍Dynamic Your ISP will automatically assign an IP address to the router. 
This IP address is based on the Media Access Control (MAC) address of your 
router. A MAC address is a unique identiier used by most network adapters 
for identiication. The MAC address can be found in the coniguration screens 
of your router; it is composed using following format: XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX. 
The MAC address can be formed only with letters and numbers. One example 
is: 0A-19-5B-BC-D2-E1.
 
❍Static IP address The ISP will assign a static IP (Internet Protocol) address to 
your router. An IP Address is composed using the following format: XXX-XXX-
XXX-XXX. The address is comprised only of numbers (for example, 86-34-233-
84). When such a connection is used, you need to know the values for the IP 
Address, Subnet Mask, and Gateway Address. All these details share the format 
of the IP Address—they are formed only from numbers and can be given to 
you only by your ISP.
 
❍Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) This is generally used by 
telephone companies that also provide Internet connections. PPPoE requires 
the ISP to create a user name and password for you. You need to enter these 
details into the router’s coniguration screens. This information is used to 
“dial” the connection to the servers of your ISP.
 
❍Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) Mostly used in Europe, this is 
another type of connection that requires authentication through a user name 
and password. It provides similar levels of security to typical virtual private 
network products.
 
●Domain Name Server (DNS) A DNS has the function of translating the human-
readable domain names we use for Web sites—for example, www.google.com 
or www.7tutorials.com—into the corresponding IP addresses that are used by 
network devices. You will need two DNS addresses: a primary and secondary. These 
addresses are the IP Addresses of two servers and you will obtain this information 
only from your ISP.

 
Preparing to Install and Conigure a Router  9
 
●Local Area Network (LAN) Settings These settings are applied to your home 
network. Most routers come with a predeined set of conigurations. If this is the 
case with your router, go ahead and use them. There is no need to change them, as 
they will work properly right out of the box. The LAN settings deine what kind of 
IP Addresses are assigned to your home computers and whether they are assigned 
dynamically or statically. For more information, consult the manual of your router 
and follow the recommendations of the manufacturer.
 
●Wireless Settings These settings are applied to all laptops or netbooks that 
access your home network via a wireless connection. First, you need to enable the 
wireless capability. Here there are a couple of details you should conigure:
 
❍Service Set Identiier (SSID) This is the name that will be displayed when 
a laptop searches for wireless networks in your area. Here, it is best to give it a 
recognizable name so that people in your home know that it is your network. 
The name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
 
❍Security Type This setting deines the authentication and encryption meth-
ods (or lack of it) that are used to protect your network. Your options include 
WPA2-PSK (best protection method, highly recommended), WPA-PSK, WEP 
(very poor protection, easily cracked), or no security, which means everybody 
can freely connect to your network. If you select to enable any type of secu-
rity, you must also type an access key (or password). Make sure this key com-
bines letters, numbers, and special characters such as #, &, +, etc. Write this 
access key down, as you will need to know it in order to establish a wireless 
connection to your home network.
Once the router is conigured correctly, make sure that all desktops are connected via 
cable and check if your drivers are installed correctly.
To help you understand how to conigure your router, we also have two installation and 
coniguration exercises, based on two different models: one from Belkin, and one from 
D-Link. If you look through both exercises, you will notice that the important elements 
are the same, irrespective of the router model. The number of steps might vary based on 
the approach the manufacturer uses, but the important aspects you need to pay atten-
tion to are the same.

 Chapter 1 Setting Up a Router and Devices
Installing and Coniguring a Belkin N+  
Wireless Router
The irst router we are using to demonstrate the installation and coniguration process is 
a popular model: the Belkin N+ Wireless. This particular device has a good reputation for 
its reliable wireless coverage and signal strength.
In this exercise, you will learn how to set up your router so that all computers on your 
home network can connect to it and access the Internet. The steps in this exercise apply 
to most Belkin routers.
SET UP Be sure that you know the details you need to use for connecting your router 
to the Internet. Ask your ISP to provide them to you. Also, inform them that you are 
about to install a home router; the ISP might need to make some changes on their 
end in order for your router to connect to the Internet successfully. Once this is done, 
unpack your router carefully and identify the instruction manual and installation 
CD or DVD. Plug in the power adapter of your router and connect your computer 
to the router via the network cable provided in the package. Connect the router to 
the Internet using the cable from your Internet provider or from the modem your 
Internet provider has installed. Finally, insert the router’s installation CD or DVD into 
your computer’s CD/DVD-ROM drive and run the SetupAssistant.exe ile.
 
1. Once the Belkin Setup CD window appears, you are asked to select what you want 
to do. Select Run the Setup Assistant now.

14 
 Chapter 1 Setting Up a Router and Devices
 
10.  Select the appropriate type of connection, as provided by your ISP. In our case, we 
needed to select Dynamic IP. 
 
11.  Click Next.
Depending on the choice you made, Setup Assistant might ask you to type certain 
connection details. For example, if you choose Static IP, you are asked to enter 
details such as the IP Address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, and DNS servers. For our 
exercise, we selected Dynamic IP, which means there’s no need to type any details 
because the router will automatically receive them from the servers of our ISP.
 
12.  Once you enter the connection details required, the Setup Assistant sends the data 
to the router. It then restarts the router so that the settings are applied and tries to 
connect to the Internet. In case you are using a modem to connect your router to 
the Internet, you are asked to unplug its power supply, wait for ive seconds, and 
then plug it in again.

4 Access the User Accounts control panel.
4 Create a new user account.
4 Switch between user accounts.
4 Turn the Guest user account on or off.
4 Change, remove, or create the password for a user account.
4 Change a user account picture, name, and type.
4 Delete a user account.
4 Log on to Windows 7 automatically.
Once you have the operating systems installed on all computers, the router and network 
connections conigured, and all your external devices installed and working, it is time to 
set up the user accounts you need to use on all your home computers.
In a typical family, you might have a few computers that are used by only one person. 
For these computers, you need only the user account setup during the installation of the 
operating system. However, there will always be a few computers that are used by more 
than one person—it can be a computer used only by children, by parents, or the whole 
family. In such usage scenarios, it is best to create a user account for each person. 
In this chapter, you will learn what user accounts are, understand how many you need to 
deine on a computer, and how to manage user accounts and conigure them the way 
you need.
Practice Files You won’t need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this chapter.

40   
Chapter 2 Setting User Accounts on All Computers
What Is a User Account and How Many  
Do You Need?
User accounts allow multiple people to share the same computer, each having their own 
private Documents folder, e-mail inbox, settings, and so on. It also improves security and 
reduces ile-sharing and network problems. Having your own account means that you 
can do all the customization you want to your Windows 7 environment, without affect-
ing other user accounts. Other users will have their own visual customization, their own 
application settings, and so forth.
There are three types of user accounts: administrator, standard (or limited user), and 
Guest user account. 
The administrator has full access to all user accounts. He can create and delete user 
accounts, create account passwords for other users, and change the name, password, 
picture, and account types for other accounts. Also, the administrator can install software, 
hardware, and conigure every aspect of the operating system.
As a rule, there must be at least one administrator user account on a computer. 
A user with standard account rights has access to programs that have already been 
installed on that computer and cannot install other software without the administrator 
password. He can change his account picture and create, change, or delete his password, 
but he cannot change his account name or type. Also, some programs (mostly old ones, 
created prior to Windows Vista and Windows 7) might not work properly on this type 
of account and might require a temporary or permanent change of the account type to 
administrator.
The Guest account is a special type of limited user account that has the following 
restrictions:
 
●Does not require a password 
 
●Cannot install software or hardware
 
●Cannot change the Guest account type
 
●Cannot create a password for the account
 
●Cannot change the Guest account picture
 
●Cannot access the iles in the Shared Documents folder
When you install Windows 7, you already have a default user account created. That user 
account always has administrator permissions. A new account should be created when 
there is another person who needs to work on the same computer.

 
Accessing the User Accounts Control Panel  41
For example, if you are a parent sharing the computer with your child, it is best to have 
two separate user accounts: one for you with administrator permissions, and one for your 
child with standard user permissions. By doing this, you make sure that the child can use 
the computer but cannot change important coniguration aspects of it. 
If you generally have temporary guests who need to use one of your computers to 
browse the Internet, check their e-mails, and perform other light computing activities, 
it is best to enable the Guest account and let them use that.
Accessing the User Accounts Control Panel
All the coniguration options that are related to user accounts are set in the User 
Accounts control panel. There are several ways to access this panel. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to access the User Accounts control panel.

5. Click the Create Account button.
Windows 7 returns you to the Manage Accounts window.
A new folder with the new account name is created in the C:\Users folder, where all the 
personal iles of the new user are kept. No user other than the administrator and the new 
user have access to this folder. 
Tip  By default, the new account doesn’t have a password set. Therefore, it is best to create one 
as soon as you log on to it.
CLEAN UP Close the Manage Accounts window.
Switching Between User Accounts
Switching between user accounts occurs when you leave the current user account turned 
on (with all running applications) and log on to a separate user account. You can switch 
back and forth between user accounts whenever you want.
In this exercise, you will learn how to switch between user accounts.

4. Type the password of the selected user.
 
5. Press ENTER.
You are now logged on to the selected user account. The user account from which you 
switched still remains active with all applications running, and you can switch back to it at 
any time.
CLEAN UP When you are done working on the computer, make sure you save any 
open documents (or any of your work) in all user accounts to which you logged on.
Turning the Guest Account On or Off
The Guest account is, by default, disabled in Windows 7. You can easily turn it on when-
ever you have a guest who needs to use your computer, and then turn it off when it is no 
longer needed.
In this exercise, you will learn how to turn the Guest account on or off.

4 Delete a library.
Libraries are one of the coolest features introduced in Windows 7. Think of a library as 
a virtual collection of folders on your computer. Virtual, because it doesn't exist as an 
actual folder—it is only a reference to one or more folders on your computer and the 
iles within them. For example, you can have documents stored in multiple locations: 
your Documents folder, on the Desktop, and some other locations. You can have a library 
called Documents that includes references to all these locations. When you open the 
Documents library, you will see all these folders and their contents as if they are subfold-
ers of the Documents library. This feature helps you organize all your iles together in 
one place, regardless of where they are stored. It also offers many beneits in terms of 
productivity when working with lots of iles spread across several locations. For example, 
you can get access to all your documents with one single click, no matter the folders 
where they are stored.
By including folders in libraries, you are also telling Windows 7 where the important data 
is located. Therefore, Windows 7 will index the folders that are part of libraries, enabling 
fast searching and stacking, based on ile properties.

62  Chapter 3 Setting Up Your Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers
Before starting to share iles and folders between your computers, it is a good idea to 
set up your libraries on all of them. Each user account deined on your computer has its 
own set of libraries. So, you might want to do this exercise for all user accounts on each 
computer that has Windows 7 installed.
In this chapter, you will learn how to create a library, add folders to it, sort the contents 
of a library, edit its properties, and delete a library.
Practice Files You can complete the exercises in this chapter using your own iles, 
folders, and libraries.
Accessing the Libraries Deined on Your Computer
By default, each computer that is running Windows 7 has the Documents, Music, Pic-
tures, and Videos libraries deined. They initially contain only sample iles, but they can 
be modiied to contain whatever you need. You can ind three of them—Documents, 
Pictures, and Music—on the upper-right side of the Start Menu.
Default
Libraries

 
Creating a New Library  63
You can ind the entire list of libraries deined on your computer in Windows Explorer. 
Open the Computer shortcut or the shortcut for Windows Explorer and look on the left 
side of the window. There, you can ind the Libraries section and all the libraries deined 
on your computer.
To open a library, just double-click it.
Creating a New Library
Libraries are speciic to each user account on your Windows 7 computer. A user can 
have multiple libraries deined, and a folder can be a part of any number of libraries.
In this exercise, you will learn how to create a library in Windows 7.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer.
 
1.  Click Libraries in the Navigation pane on the left side.
A list opens that shows the existing libraries.

64  Chapter 3 Setting Up Your Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers
 
2.  Click the New Library button, located on the bar at the top of the Libraries 
window. 
This creates a library called New Library.

 
Adding Folders to a Library  65
Tip  An alternative way to create a library is to right-click anywhere in the empty space 
on the right side of the window and select New -> Library.
 
3.  Type the name you want to use for your library.
 
4.  Press Enter.
An empty library with the name you speciied is created. 
CLEAN UP Repeat this procedure until you have created as many libraries as you 
need.
Adding Folders to a Library
Once you have created your library (or libraries), it’s time to add the folders you want
to have within it. There are many ways in which you can add folders to a library.
In this exercise, you will learn how to add folders to a library in Windows 7 using the 
simplest procedure available.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer.
 
1.  Browse to the folder you want to add to your library and select it.
 
2.  Click the Include in library button, located toward the top of the Windows 
Explorer window.
A list opens that shows all existing libraries.

66  Chapter 3 Setting Up Your Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers
 
3.  Select the library in which you want to include the folder.
The Updating Library window opens, which displays a progress bar to show you 
how the process of including the selected folder in the library is proceeding. 

 
Removing Folders from a Library  67
Note  If the folder you added does not contain many items, chances are this window 
will disappear very quickly, or you might not even notice it. For larger folders, it takes a 
longer time until it disappears.
 
4.  The folder you selected is now included in the library. To conirm that the proce-
dure worked, click the library and you will see that the folder appears under it.
CLEAN UP Repeat this procedure until you have included all the folders that you 
want to have in the library.
Removing Folders from a Library
Removing a folder from a library is as easy as adding one, and of course, there is more 
than one way of doing this.
In this exercise, you will learn how to remove folders from a library in Windows 7 using 
the simplest procedure available.

68  Chapter 3 Setting Up Your Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers
SET UP Open Windows Explorer.
 
1.  Browse to the library from which you want to remove the folder.
 
2.  Click the library. 
The library expands to show the folders that are part of it.
 
3.  Right-click the folder that you want to remove from the library.
 
4.  Select Remove location from library.
The folder is now removed from the library. However, the folder will continue to 
exist on your computer in its original location, and its contents will not be modiied 
in any way by this procedure. The only difference is that Windows 7 will no longer 
index it automatically.
CLEAN UP Close Windows Explorer.

 
Editing the Properties of a Library  69
Editing the Properties of a Library
One very important coniguration step you must make is to correctly set the properties 
of each library. This step should be done after you have added the folders you want to 
each library.
In this exercise, you will learn how to edit the properties of any library and make impor-
tant settings, such as selecting the default save location for a library, the type of library, 
and others.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer.
 
1.  Select the library that you want to conigure.
 
2.  Right-click it to open the contextual menu.

70  Chapter 3 Setting Up Your Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers
 
3.  Select Properties.
The Properties window opens for the selected library.
 
4.  If you have more than one folder in a library, it is a good idea to specify which one 
should be the default save location. This helps when you want to copy something 
to the library—it will be automatically copied to the default save location. To set a 
folder, select it and click Set save location.
 
5.  It is a good idea to set the type of the library. Go to the Optimize this library for 
section.
 
6.  Click the drop-down list. 
A list of available options opens. The options are: General Items, Documents, Music, 
Pictures, and Videos.

 
Quick Sorting the Content of a Library  71
 
7.  Select the option that is best suited to your library.
Depending on your choice, the icon of the library will change, as well as the options 
made available by Windows 7 when working with the library.
 
8.  If you want to include or remove folders, use the appropriate buttons: Include a 
folder or Remove.
 
9.  If you want to have the library displayed in the Navigation pane of Windows 
Explorer, in the Attributes section, select the check box beside Shown in 
navigation pane.
Note  The Shared check box indicates whether or not the library is shared. You cannot 
make any changes to it.
 
10.  If you are not happy with the settings you’ve made, you can click Restore Defaults. 
This restores the library to its initial settings, and you can change its properties from 
scratch.
 
11.  When you’re done setting the options as you want them, click OK.
The library is now set according to your preference.
CLEAN UP Repeat this procedure for all libraries.
Quick Sorting the Content of a Library
In order to help you more quickly ind what you are searching for, Windows 7 provides a 
predeined set of sorting criteria, depending on the type of library you are working with 
(General Items, Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos).
To access these quick sorting criteria, click the down arrow next to Arrange by.

72  Chapter 3 Setting Up Your Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers
Depending on the type of library you are sorting, you have the following options:
 
●Documents: Folder, Author, Date modiied, Tag, Type, Name
 
●Pictures: Folder, Month, Day, Rating, Tag
 
●Music: Folder, Album, Artist, Song, Genre, Rating
 
●Videos: Folder, Year, Type, Length, Name
Experiment with each option to better understand how they work.

 
Deleting a Library  73
Deleting a Library
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, a library is a virtual collection of iles and 
folders. Deleting a library has no affect on its contents—only the virtual links between 
the library and the folders inside it are affected. Therefore, if you delete a library, the 
folders and iles that were part of it will continue to exist on your computer, in the same 
location as they always did. The only difference is that you might not be able to access 
them so easily, and Windows 7 will no longer index them, which means you won’t be 
able to take advantage of fast searching and stacking based on ile properties.
In this exercise, you will learn how to delete a library.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer.
 
1.  Select the library you want to delete.
 
2.  Right-click the library to open the contextual menu.

74  Chapter 3 Setting Up Your Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers
 
3.  Select Delete.
Windows 7 asks you to conirm the deletion process.
 
4.  Click Yes.
This takes you to the Libraries window, in which you can see the remaining 
libraries.
The library you just deleted is no longer included in the list of available libraries.
CLEAN UP Close Windows Explorer.

The Network and Sharing Center was irst introduced in Windows Vista and has been 
further ine-tuned in Windows 7, improving usability and access to certain features and 
coniguration options. This tool is the main control panel for starting different network 
coniguration tasks. In this chapter, you will learn irst how to ind and open the Network 
and Sharing Center. Next, you will learn how to access different coniguration panels that 
are found in the Network and Sharing Center so that you can conigure your network 
adapters, change your network location correctly (depending on the network to which 
you are connected), and set your workgroup so that computers with other operating 
systems installed can detect and connect to your computer. 
On top of that, you will learn how to connect to different wireless networks, including 
those that are hidden and are not detected automatically by Windows 7. To completely 
cover the topic, you will also learn how to create your own ad hoc wireless network 
between two computers so that you can share iles between them.
Tip  Before completing the exercises in this chapter, make sure you have read Chapter 1, 
“Setting Up a Router and Devices” and followed the instructions for installing and coniguring 
your hardware, drivers, and network router. If your router and other network devices are not 
installed and conigured correctly, you will not get the desired results.

78  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
Practice Files You won’t need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this chapter.
Opening the Networking and Sharing Center
You can launch the Network and Sharing Center in three ways.
One way is to click the network icon from the right side of the taskbar, then click Open 
Network and Sharing Center.
The network icon
A second (and the quickest) way is to launch the Run window by pressing the Windows 
key+R, typing control.exe/name Microsoft.NetworkAndSharingCenter, then clicking 
OK.

 
Opening the Networking and Sharing Center  79
A third way is to choose Control Panel -> Network And Internet -> Network And Sharing 
Center.
The Network and Sharing Center window is split into two areas. On the left side, there is 
a column containing shortcuts toward tasks, such as managing your wireless networks, 
changing settings for all network adapters, and changing network sharing settings. On 
the bottom of the same column, there are shortcuts to the Homegroup settings panel, 
the Internet Options panel, and the Windows Firewall panel. On the right side, you have 
basic information about the current network connection and links to several wizards that 
allow you to change some of your network settings.

80  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
Coniguring Network Adapters
In most cases, your home router is set to assign IP Addresses automatically to all comput-
ers on your network. This way, all you have to do is plug in the network cables to the 
router and your home computers, and the network connection works without any issues.
If you set the home router to assign IP Addresses in a static way to computers on your 
networks, or if you have some other special setup, you will need to conigure the network 
adapters (network cards) on all or some of the computers in your network. 
In this exercise, you will access the settings window of your network adapters and learn 
how to conigure them.

 
Coniguring Network Adapters  81
SET UP Open the Network and Sharing Center.
 
1.  In the left column, click the Change adapter settings link.
The Network Connections window opens. Here, you see all network adapters and 
their status.
Important  Each network adapter has three rows that describe them: the irst shows the 
name of the adapter, the second shows the status of the adapter (disconnected, disabled, 
network, network cable unplugged), and the third shows the manufacturer and model 
name of the adapter.
Each adapter will have its own icon, colored in either gray or blue. Gray icons represent 
network adapters that are disconnected or disabled. Blue icons represent enabled and  
connected adapters.
If you have a network adapter that is enabled but not connected, you will see a  
red “X” near it. Also, in the second row of its description, it displays the text Net-
work Cable Unplugged.
In such scenarios, you need to check the cable connection and ensure that the 
network cable is plugged in correctly to both the computer and the router.
 
2.  Double-click the network adapter you want.
A Status window opens (yours may look different).
Note  You can check the current settings of a network adapter and change them 
(if needed).

82  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
3.  Click the Details button.
The Network Connection Details window opens.

 
Coniguring Network Adapters  83
 
4.  When you’re inished checking all the current settings, click Close.
Tip  You can change any property of a network adapter. However, in most home networks, 
all you need to change is the IP Addresses and DNS settings. Therefore, we will stick 
mainly to these two settings, but we will mention the others briely as well.
 
5.  In the Status window, click the Properties button.
The Properties window of your local area connection opens (yours may look slightly 
different).
Tip  Another way to go to the Properties window is to right-click the network adapter 
when you are in the Network Connections window (see step 1), and then click Properties.
 
6.  To change the IP Address and DNS settings, double-click Internet Protocol 
Version 4 (TCP/IPv4). 
Note  The Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties window will open. In it, you 
can either set the IP Addresses and DNS server to be set automatically (if your home 
router is conigured to assign these settings automatically to all computers) or set them 
manually.

84  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
7.  If you need to manually set IP addresses or DNS settings, select the appropriate 
boxes and type the needed information. DNS settings will be provided by your 
Internet provider while IP addresses should be according to how the home router  
is set to work with the home network.
 
8.  If you want the IP addresses to be assigned automatically but you need to manu-
ally enter the DNS server addresses, you can leave the Obtain an IP address 
automatically option selected, then choose the Use the following DNS server 
addresses option.
 
9.  If you click the Advanced button, you will be able to set more advanced param-
eters, such as NetBIOS settings (Network Basic Input/Output System), WINS 
addresses (Windows Internet Name Service), and other DNS-related details. For a 
typical home network, setting these parameters is not needed because the default 
values generally work, so we won’t enter into detail about them.
 
10.  Click OK.
CLEAN UP If you are not comfortable with making your own home network settings,  
it is best to let the router set IP addresses and all other settings dynamically—leave 
the options for Obtain an IP Address Automatically and Use the Following DNS Server 
Addresses selected. This way, the home router will do all the work of setting the 
network for you while Windows 7 will automatically apply the right settings to your 
network devices and connections.

 
Enabling or Disabling a Network Adapter  85
Enabling or Disabling a Network Adapter
Depending on your computing needs, you might want to enable or disable some of 
the network adapters that exist on your computer. For example, if you are a laptop user 
on the road and you connect to the Internet via a mobile modem, you might want to 
disable your wireless network adapter while in transit to save on battery so you can use 
your laptop for a longer period of time. When you get to a hotel room or other location 
where you can connect to the Internet again and you want to use the local wireless con-
nection, you will need to re-enable the wireless network adapter.
To enable a network adapter, right-click its icon, then select Enable.
To disable a network adapter, right-click it, then select Disable.

86  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
Connecting to a Wireless Network
A growing number of people use laptops, notebooks, and netbooks instead of desktop 
computers. As a result of this trend—plus the growing number of devices like smartphones—
more people use wireless networks on a regular basis. Windows 7 offers all you need to 
connect to wireless networks effortlessly. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to detect wireless networks in Windows 7 and how to 
connect to them. 
SET UP Before trying to connect to a wireless network, check if your wireless 
network adapter is detected by Windows 7, that it has the appropriate drivers 
installed, and that it is enabled.
 
1.  On the right side of the taskbar, click the wireless network icon.
A window with available network connections opens. The list is split by type of 
available network connections. At the top you have the available dial-up and 
virtual private network (VPN) connections, while at the bottom you have a list with 
the wireless networks that Windows 7 has detected. To refresh the list of available 
networks, click the Refresh icon, located at the upper-right side.
Refresh icon
Troubleshooting  If Windows 7 has not detected any connections and you know for a fact that 
there should be at least one wireless network available in your area, you should check whether 
your wireless network card has the appropriate drivers installed and that it is enabled.

 
Connecting to a Wireless Network  87
 
2.  Scroll down through the list of available networks.
Note  If you hover your mouse cursor over a network icon for a second, you will see more 
details about it. Windows 7 will show the following: the network name, signal strength, 
the type of wireless security used (if any), and its Service Set identiier (SSID).
Important  Be careful with wireless networks that have no security enabled—they can 
be used to steal personal data. If you connect to such networks, make sure your security 
solutions are turned on.

88  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
3.  Once you decide which network to connect to, click it, and then click Connect.
Tip  If you plan to use that network in the future, make sure you select the Connect 
Automatically check box before clicking Connect. This way, the next time you start your 
laptop in the same location, it will automatically connect to this wireless network without 
the need for manual intervention.
Important  After a few seconds, you will be asked to enter the security key. Ask the 
administrator of the network for the wireless security key or, if you have connected to 
your own home network, take it from the control panel of your router. 
 
4.  Type the security key, then click OK.
Tip  If you are in a public environment, it is best to select the Hide Characters check box 
so that other people can’t see what you are typing.
CLEAN UP When you connect to the wireless network for the irst time, make sure 
you assign it the correct network location. For instructions on how to do this, see the 
“Setting the Network Location” section on page 108.
If you are successful, the wireless icon on your taskbar changes to indicate your connec-
tion status and how powerful the wireless signal is.
Connected
Not connected

 
Connecting to a Hidden Wireless Network  89
Note  If you typed an incorrect password, Windows 7 will prompt you to type it again and again 
until it matches the password of the network that you are connecting to. If everything is OK, 
Windows 7 will connect to the network you selected using the given security key.
Troubleshooting If you cannot connect to a wireless network from your Windows 7 computer, 
but all your other computers with older operating systems can, chances are you need to 
upgrade the irmware on your wireless router. Please consult the Internet page of your router’s 
model to see if there are any upgrades available. If there are, download and install the latest 
version of irmware. Unfortunately, some older router models do not work very well with 
computers that use Windows 7 unless you perform a irmware upgrade.
Connecting to a Hidden Wireless Network
Hidden wireless networks are those networks that do not broadcast their Network ID 
(SSID). While not that many people use such networks, some feel a bit more secure by 
having their home wireless network hidden from unwanted guests. Therefore, if you’ve 
set your wireless network this way, you need to know how to connect to such networks.
Tip  According to Microsoft TechNet’s community and other reputable Web sites, hidden 
wireless networks are not undetectable. On the contrary, computers conigured to connect to 
such networks are constantly disclosing the Network ID (SSID) of those networks, even when 
they are not in range. As a result, using such networks actually compromises the privacy of the 
clients connected to them.
In this exercise, you will learn how to connect to hidden wireless networks.
SET UP First and foremost, you need to know all the identiication and connection 
details of the hidden wireless network to which you want to connect. Therefore, open 
your router’s coniguration page and go to the Wireless coniguration menu. Write 
down the values for the Network ID (SSID) and Security ields. 
Depending on what type of security your wireless network has, you will need to write 
down the value of another important ield, as follows:
 
●For WEP security, note the value of the WEP Key ield.
 
●For WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK(AES) security, note the value of the Preshare Key ield.
Note  If your wireless network has no security enabled, then you only need to know the value of 
the Network ID (SSID) ield. 
 
1.  Open the Network and Sharing Center, then click Set Up a Connection or 
Network.
The Set Up A Connection Or Network window opens.

90  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
2.  Select Manually connect to a wireless network, then click Next.
The Manually Connect To A Wireless Network wizard displays several ields in 
which you need to supply information.

 
Connecting to a Hidden Wireless Network  91
 
3.  In the Network name ield, type the name of the wireless network you want to 
connect to; this is the equivalent of the Network ID (SSID) ield from your router’s 
wireless coniguration menus.
 
4.  In the Security type ield (the type of security that’s used by your wireless network), 
choose the appropriate option: WEP for WEP security, WPA-Personal for WPA-PSK 
security, or WPA2-Personal for WPA2-PSK (AES) security.
Note  WPA2-Enterprise, WPA-Enterprise, and 802.1x are not covered in this book, as they 
are speciic only to business networks not home networks. If you need to connect to a 
hidden business network, contact the organization’s network administrator or the help 
desk team for guidance.

92  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
5.  In the Encryption type ield, if the wireless network is using WPA2-Personal 
(WPA2-PSK(AES)) security, select AES. Otherwise, leave the default value Windows  
7 provides for you.

 
Connecting to a Hidden Wireless Network  93
 
6.  In the Security Key ield (for WEP, WPA2 Personal, and WPA Personal), you will 
need to enter the security key used to connect to the wireless network.
This is the value of the WEP Key ield (for WEP security) or the value of the Preshare 
Key ield (for WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK(AES) security).
Tip  If you are in a public environment, it is best to select the Hide characters check box 
so that other people can’t see what you are typing.
 
7.  Don’t forget to select the other two check boxes. Start this connection automati-
cally will allow you to connect automatically to the wireless network each time 
you log on, and Connect even if the network is not broadcasting will allow you 
to connect to it even if the Network ID (SSID) is hidden, as is the case with hidden 
wireless networks.
 
8.  Once you’ve entered all the necessary data, click Next.
When done, you will see a message indicating that you have successfully added the 
wireless network to your computer.
 
9.  If you are unsure of any of the settings, you can click Change connection settings 
and review them all. A window opens where you can change all your settings.

94  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
Note  The same window can be opened at any time by going to Control Panel -> Network 
and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center -> Manage Wireless Networks, and then 
double-clicking the wireless network.
 
10.  Click OK to close the network properties window, then click Close to end the 
Manually Connect to a Wireless Network wizard. When done, Windows 7 auto-
matically connects to the hidden wireless network.
CLEAN UP When you connect to the hidden wireless network for the irst time, make 
sure you assign it the correct network location. For instructions, check the “Setting 
the Network Location” section on page 108.

Setting Up an Ad Hoc Wireless Network Between Computers   95
The wireless icon on your taskbar shows your connection status and how powerful the 
wireless signal is.
Setting Up an Ad Hoc Wireless Network  
Between Computers
An ad hoc wireless network can be created between mobile computers, such as laptops 
or netbooks, and allow users to share iles and folders between them quickly. This can be 
useful when you need to connect your laptop to another person’s to quickly share iles. 
With further coniguration, you can also use this type of network connection to share the 
Internet connection on one of the computers.
The procedures are divided into three parts: creating the ad hoc wireless network, 
connecting other computers to it, and sharing iles and folders on the newly created 
network.
Creating an Ad Hoc Wireless Network
Creating the ad hoc wireless network can be done on either of the two computers you 
are trying to connect.
In this exercise, you will learn how to create and conigure an ad hoc wireless network.
SET UP Before trying to create the ad hoc wireless network, check that your wireless 
network adapter is detected by Windows 7, that it has the appropriate drivers 
installed, and that it is enabled.
 
1.  Open the Network and Sharing Center, and then click Set Up a Connection or 
Network.
The Set Up A Connection Or Network window opens.

96  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
2.  Select Set up a wireless ad hoc (computer-to-computer) network, then click 
Next.
The Set Up An Ad Hoc Network window opens and describes the things you can do 
on a wireless ad hoc network.

 
Setting Up an Ad Hoc Wireless Network Between Computers   97
 
3.  Read the contents of the window, then click Next.
The Set Up An Ad Hoc Network window opens.
 
4.  Type the network name, then select the security type you want to use. 
Tip  For more security, I recommend you choose WPA2-Personal. It provides better 
encryption and is much harder to crack than WEP.
 
5.  Type the password you want to use and, in case you want to use this network on 
other occasions, select the Save this network check box.
 
6.  Click Next.
The wizard will create the network. This activity should take no more than a few 
seconds.

98  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
When inished, you will receive a notiication that the network has been created 
and is ready to use.
 
7.  Click Close.
Your laptop or netbook will now broadcast this newly created network and will wait 
for other computers to connect.
CLEAN UP Keep the laptop or netbook on which you created the network turned 
on and start coniguring the client computer that will connect to it. Follow the 
instructions in Chapter 5, “Customizing Network Sharing Settings in Windows 7.”

 
Setting Up an Ad Hoc Wireless Network Between Computers   99
Connecting Other Computers to an Ad Hoc  
Wireless Network
Once the ad hoc network has been created on one of your computers, it is time to 
connect the second computer to it. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to connect a computer to an existing ad hoc wireless 
network.
SET UP Before trying to connect to the ad hoc wireless network, check that your 
wireless network adapter is detected by Windows 7, that it has the appropriate 
drivers installed, and that it is enabled.
 
1.  Click the wireless icon. 
You will see the list of all available wireless networks, including the ad hoc one you 
just created. Windows 7 will show the network’s name plus the note that it is wait-
ing for users.

100  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
Tip  If you don’t see the ad hoc network, wait a few seconds and then click the 
refresh icon.
 
2.  Select the test ad hoc network that you just created, then click Connect.
 
3.  Type the password, then click OK.
Windows 7 will take a few seconds to connect to the network.
CLEAN UP Before trying to share iles or folders between computers, read the 
instructions in Chapter 5. There are some other settings you need to specify irst.
Sharing Files on an Ad Hoc Wireless Network
After setting up an ad hoc computer-to-computer network and connecting the client 
computer, one would assume that features such as ile sharing, networking discovery, 
and so on would be working and that you would be able to start sharing the content you 
need. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
After a client is connected, it will spend a few seconds identifying the network. 

 
Setting Up an Ad Hoc Wireless Network Between Computers   101
After the network is identiied, Windows 7 will assign to it the public network proile. This 
means that you cannot share iles and folders, as this option is disabled for public net-
works. Another problem is the fact that you cannot change the assigned network proile 
from public to work or home so that sharing of iles and folders is enabled.

102  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
This means that you need to manually change the network and sharing settings for the 
public network proile so that the sharing of iles and folders is enabled.
See Also  To learn how to change the network and sharing settings for the public network 
proile, check the instructions detailed in Chapter 5.
Security Warning  When you disconnect from the ad hoc network, make sure that you reset the 
network sharing settings for the public network proile. If you keep them unchanged, the next 
time you connect to a different public network, your computer might be at risk by allowing 
others to have access to your iles and folders. So, be sure that you reset these settings to their 
default values when you are done.
Exporting and Importing Wireless Network Settings
One of the biggest annoyances when setting up wireless networks is remembering the 
security key and typing it correctly so that you can connect all laptops and netbooks to it. 
However, Windows 7 makes it easy to export your wireless settings from one machine to 
another.
The backup of the wireless networks settings can be easily done from Windows 7, saved 
to a USB stick, and then imported from the USB stick onto laptops and netbooks running 
Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.
The procedures are divided in two parts: creating the backup of the settings on a USB 
memory stick, and importing the settings on other computers with Microsoft operating 
systems.
Exporting the Wireless Network Settings
All the settings of a wireless network that you have connected to are stored by Windows 
7, and they can be reused when making another connection. These settings can be easily 
backed up on a USB memory stick.
In this exercise, you will learn how to back up the settings of any wireless network.

 
Exporting and Importing Wireless Network Settings  103
SET UP Make sure that you have connected to the wireless network from which you 
want to back up the settings at least once before starting this exercise. Also, open the 
Network and Sharing Center and make sure that you have a USB stick with you.
 
1.  On the left side of the Network and Sharing Center window, click the Manage 
Wireless Networks link. 
In the Manage Wireless Networks window, you will see a list of all the wireless net-
works to which you have connected in the past.
 
2.  Double-click the wireless network that you want to back up.
A window presenting all the properties of the network appears.

104  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
3.  To save the settings of the wireless network to a lash drive, click the Copy this 
network proile to a USB lash drive link.
The Copy Network Settings Wizard now opens.

 
Exporting and Importing Wireless Network Settings  105
 
4.  Insert the USB lash drive and wait until it is detected; you will know that it is ready 
for use when the Next button is no longer gray.

106  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
5.  Click Next. The copying process starts and, after a few seconds, you are notiied of 
the success or failure of the operation.
 
6.  Click Close. The backup operation is now done.
Look on your USB lash drive and you will see a setupSNK.exe ile and a SMRTNTKY 
folder.

 
Exporting and Importing Wireless Network Settings  107
CLEAN UP Make sure that you don’t delete the iles and folders created on the 
memory stick, and remove the stick safely before using it to import the wireless 
network settings on other computers.
Importing the Wireless Network Settings
By importing the settings of a wireless network onto other computers, you save time by 
not having to manually conigure them. With just two clicks, you can get one computer 
correctly conigured and ready to connect to the wireless network.
In this exercise, you will learn how to import the settings of a previously backed up wire-
less network.
SET UP Plug in the USB memory stick on which you backed up the wireless network 
settings and wait for your operating system to detect and install it correctly.
 
1.  Run the setupSNK.exe ile found on the memory stick.
The Wireless Network Setup Wizard now opens and asks if you want to add your 
computer to the wireless network you have previously backed up.

108  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
2.  Click Yes.
The settings are now imported and you will be notiied when done.
 
3.  Click OK.
The settings of the wireless network have been installed on your computer and from this 
point forward, you will be able to connect to it when in range, without having to type its 
security key or adjusting any other settings.
CLEAN UP Remove the USB memory stick from your computer. Do not delete its 
contents if you plan to use it in the future.
Setting the Network Location
A network location in Windows 7 is the proile that contains a collection of network and 
sharing settings that apply to the network to which you are connected. Based on the 
network location that is assigned to your active network connection, features such as ile 
and printer sharing, network discovery, and others might be turned on or off.

 
Setting the Network Location  109
These network locations are very useful to people who are very mobile and connect their 
computers to many networks. For example, you could use your work laptop to connect 
to your company network, take it home at the end of the day and connect to your home 
network, or connect to a network at your friend’s place when you’re visiting during the 
weekend. Each time you connect to a new network, Windows 7 will assign a network 
proile. With one choice, you get the entire set of network settings correctly changed. 
This way you won’t compromise your security, and you have enabled only the network 
features that you actually need for each connection.
Network Locations: Home vs. Work vs. Public
Windows 7 allows you to choose among three types of network locations:
 
●Home network Choose this location when you are connected to your home 
network or a network with people and devices you trust. By default, network 
discovery will be turned on and you will be able to see other computers and 
devices that are part of the network. Also, this will allow other computers from 
the network to access your computer. On home networks, you will also be 
allowed to create or join a Homegroup. 
 
●Work network This proile is good when connecting to your workplace 
network. It shares the same settings with Home network, with the exception 
that it won’t allow you to create or join a Homegroup. 

110  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
●Public network This proile is perfect when you are in a public place like 
an airport, pub, or coffee shop. When this proile is used, network discovery 
and sharing are turned off. Other computers from the same network will not 
be able to see yours. This setting is also useful when your computer is directly 
connected to the Internet (direct cable/modem connection, mobile Internet, 
and so on).
The default settings can be changed for all proiles. To learn how to do this, check 
the instructions detailed in Chapter 5.
NOTE  There is also a fourth network location proile called Domain network. This proile 
cannot be set by a normal user. It is available for enterprise workplaces and can be set only by 
the network administrator. Under this proile, the network and sharing settings applied are the 
ones set by your company, and you cannot change them.
Changing the Network Location
When you connect to a network for the irst time, Windows 7 automatically asks you 
about the type of location proile you want to assign to that network. Based on your 
choice, a speciic set of network and sharing settings is applied.
In this exercise, you will learn how to change the network location applied to any net-
work you are connected to.
SET UP Open the Network and Sharing Center.
Current network
location link
 
1.  Click the link displaying the name of the current network location. This starts the 
Set Network Location Wizard.

 
Setting the Network Location  111
NOTE  If you connect to a network for the irst time, Windows 7 will show the Set 
Network Location Wizard automatically. You need to manually start it only if you want  
to change the current location assigned to the network.
 
2.  Click the desired network location according to the recommendations detailed 
earlier in this chapter.
Windows 7 informs you of the change in network location.

112  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
3.  Click the Close button.
The network and sharing settings corresponding to the selected network location are 
now applied.
CLEAN UP Close the Network and Sharing Center.
Setting the Workgroup
A workgroup is the name assigned to a group of computers connected in a network. 
Computers that are part of the same workgroup can easily detect each other and share 
iles and folders among workgroup members. A computer can only be part of a single 
workgroup, and many computers can be part of the same workgroup.
Workgroups are used for small networks, and each computer has its own set of rules and 
settings. They work well for home or small-business networks. In order to access a com-
puter within the workgroup, you need to have a user account deined on that computer. 
By default, Windows 7 assigns the workgroup “Workgroup” to a computer. If you have 
only Windows 7 computers in your home network, you won’t need to make any changes. 
However, if you have multiple operating systems, then setting the same workgroup on all 
will help.

 
Setting the Workgroup  113
Changing the Workgroup
Change the workgroup so that it is set the same on all the computers that are part 
of your home network. This change will help ensure that all computers detect each 
other and work together properly when exchanging iles and folders.
In this exercise, you will learn how to change the workgroup set for your computer.
SET UP Write down the workgroup set on all the computers from your home 
network and change it only for those that have different settings than the others. 
You need to make sure that it is set the same on all computers.
 
1.  Choose Control Panel -> System and Security -> System.
This opens the System window. 
This section shows the
computer name and workgroup
Here, you will be able to see your computer name and the currently assigned 
workgroup.

4.  In the Workgroup ield, type the name of the workgroup you want your computer 
to join. 
 
5.  Click OK. 
Windows 7 notiies you of the change with a welcome note.
 
6.  Click OK.
Windows 7 notiies you that you need to restart your computer in order for the 
change to be applied.
 
7.  Click OK.
The System Properties window is shown again.

116  Chapter 4 Creating the Network
 
8.  Click Close.
Windows 7 asks if you want to restart your computer now or later.
 
9.  Close any open documents, then click Restart Now.
After the restart, your computer joins the newly assigned workgroup. 
NOTE  If you click Restart Later, the workgroup change will be applied the next time you 
reboot your computer.
CLEAN UP Close the System window and (in case you chose to Restart Later) repeat 
the procedure on all computers for which you need to change the workgroup.

4 Conigure network sharing settings.
Compared to older versions of Microsoft operating systems, Windows 7 makes it much 
easier to conigure network sharing settings. These settings are deined by a different 
network proile: one set of settings that apply to trusted network locations such as home 
and work, and another that applies to untrusted public networks.
See Also  To learn more about network locations, see the “Network Locations: Home vs. Work 
vs. Public” section in Chapter 4, “Creating the Network.”
In this chapter, you will learn where to ind the network sharing settings, how to turn net-
work discovery, ile sharing, media streaming, and password protection on or off; how to 
set encryption for sharing connections; and how to conigure Homegroup connections.
See Also  To learn more about the Homegroup, see Chapter 6, “Creating the Homegroup and 
Joining Windows 7 Computers.”
Practice Files You do not need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this 
chapter.
Finding the Network Sharing Settings
The great thing about Windows 7 is that it organizes all your network sharing settings in

subfolders: Public Desktop, Public Documents, Public Downloads, Public Music, 
Public Pictures, and Public Videos. Users from the other computers can read the 
contents of the Public folder and write iles inside it and its subfolders. When turned 
off, this folder is not shared with your network.

 
Coniguring the Network Sharing Settings  123
Recommendation  Turn off Public Folder Sharing unless using this folder for sharing 
is something you ind very useful. Depending on your personal preference, you might 
choose to share iles and folders directly with others, without the need to copy them to 
the Public folder.
 
7.  Turn Public folder sharing on or off, depending on your needs.
 
8.  Scroll down to Media Streaming. 
This shows the current setting. This feature allows you to stream multimedia iles 
(pictures, video, and music) using Windows Media Player 12. When turned on, you

folders.
 
11.  Set the type of encryption you need to use, depending on your home network.
 
12.  Scroll down to Password protected sharing. 
This shows the current setting. Password protected sharing allows people to access 
your shared iles and folders only if they have a user account and password set on 
your computer. If they don’t know such details, they cannot connect to your shared 
items. 

124  Chapter 5 Customizing Network Sharing Settings in Windows 7
Recommendation  Choose Turn off password protected sharing for home or work 
networks. Choose turn on password protected sharing for public networks.
 
13.  Turn Password protected sharing on or off, depending on your needs.
 
14.  Scroll down to Homegroup connections. 
This shows the current setting. Once your computer has joined the Homegroup, 
Windows 7 will automatically manage your connections. That’s why the option 
for Allow Windows to manage Homegroup connections is selected. If you choose 
the Use user accounts and passwords to connect to other computers option, you 
will need to manually type a user name and password when you connect to other 
computers instead of letting Windows 7 do the job for you.
Recommendation  Use only Allow Windows to manage Homegroup connections.
Note  This setting is available only for Home or Work network proiles. It is not for Public 
proiles.
 
15.  Set Homegroup connections according to your needs.

4 Join a computer to a Homegroup.
4 Access iles, folders, and devices shared on the Homegroup.
4 Leave a Homegroup.
4 Solve some of the known issues encountered with the Homegroup feature.
Homegroup is a new feature introduced in Windows 7 that aims to simplify the process of 
sharing content and devices on your home network. In older versions of Windows, shar-
ing content was a tedious and sometimes painful process, especially for home users. By 
using the Homegroup, you can now access all shared iles and devices in your home net-
work with very few clicks and without the need to type any user names and passwords.
This feature is designed to be available for computers connected to a home network. 
Each time you connect your computer to a new network, Windows 7 asks you to set the 
network location. If you select Home Network, it means you are in a trusted network of 
computers, and Windows 7 allows you to use the Homegroup feature. If you select Work 
Network or Public Network, this feature will not be available.

128  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers
See Also  To learn more about Network locations, read the “Setting the Network Location” 
section found in Chapter 4, “Creating the Network.”
Even though this feature is very useful and easy to use, unfortunately it has a very impor-
tant limitation: it is available only for computers running Windows 7. Only computers 
with Windows 7 can join a Homegroup and take advantage of it.
See Also  If you own computers with Windows XP and Windows Vista installed, see Chapter 10, 
“Sharing Between Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 Computers,” for instructions on 
how to share iles, folders, and devices with your Windows 7 computers. 
See Also  If you own computers with Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux installed, see Chapter 11, 
“Sharing Between Mac OS X and Windows 7 Computers,” and Chapter 12, “Sharing Between 
Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers,” respectively, for instructions on how to share iles, 
folders, and devices with your Windows 7 computers. 
In this chapter, you learn how to create a Homegroup, add other home computers to it, 
access content and devices shared by them via the Homegroup feature, and manage the 
password used to connect all computers to the Homegroup. Last but not least, you will

learn how to set a computer to leave the Homegroup and how to solve one of the most 
common problems encountered with this feature.
Practice Files You won’t need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this chapter.
Creating the Homegroup
After you have created the network and customized the network sharing settings, it is 
time to create the Homegroup for your home computers to join and exchange libraries, 
iles, folders, and devices.
In this exercise, you will learn how to create a Homegroup for your home network 
computers.
SET UP Open the Network and Sharing Center and make sure the network location is 
set to Home Network.
 
1.  Click the Homegroup link located at the lower-left side of the Network and 
Sharing Center window.
The Homegroup Creation Wizard opens.

130  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers
Note  If, when you click the Homegroup link, you do not see a window similar to the one 
shown here, but something with the settings of an existing Homegroup, it means the 
computer is already part of a Homegroup. In this scenario, you either keep the computer 
as part of that Homegroup or leave it and create a new one. To learn how to leave a 
Homegroup, read the “Leaving a Homegroup” section on page 143.
 
2.  Click Create a Homegroup.
This opens the Create A Homegroup window, where you can select the items you 
want to share with the other computers that will join the Homegroup. A limited list 
of libraries is available for sharing: Pictures, Documents, Music, and Videos. You can 
also share your printers.
See Also  To learn more about libraries in Windows 7, read Chapter 3, “Setting Up Your 
Libraries on all Windows 7 Computers.”
 
3.  Select the items you want to share, then click Next.
After a few seconds, Windows 7 will show an automatically generated password 
for the Homegroup. This password will be used by other computers to join the 
Homegroup.

 
Creating the Homegroup  131
 
4.  Write down the password, then click Finish.
The Homegroup is now created and other computers from your home network can 
join it. At the end of the wizard, you return to the Homegroup window, where you 
see the list of available settings.

132  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers

4.  When done, close the window.
CLEAN UP Close the Homegroup window.
Changing the Password of a Homegroup
Changing the password of a Homegroup can be done from any computer that joined it. 
However, if you change the password after your home computers have joined the Home-
group, you will need to retype it on all computers in order for them to join again. If you 
change the password before joining other computers, you don’t need to rejoin them.
In this exercise, you will learn how to change the password of an existing Homegroup.
SET UP Open the Network and Sharing Center.

 
Changing the Password of a Homegroup  135
 
1.  Click on the Homegroup link.
The Homegroup window opens.
 
2.  Click Change the password.
A dialog box appears in which Windows 7 notiies you that changing the Home-
group password will disconnect everyone who has joined it thus far.

136  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers
 
3.  Click Change the password.
Windows 7 now generates a new random password for your Homegroup.
Refresh button
 
4.  If you prefer another new password, you can type your own custom password or 
click the Refresh button to have Windows 7 generate another one for you.

 
Changing the Password of a Homegroup  137
If you type your own password, ensure that it is at least eight characters long. Oth-
erwise, Windows 7 won’t accept it as a valid password.
 
5.  When done, click Next.
Windows 7 notiies you that the password has been changed.
 
6.  Click Finish.
The password for the Homegroup is now changed and can be used by other computers

CLEAN UP Don’t forget to rejoin all computers that have been disconnected from 
the Homegroup due to the password change.

138  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers
Joining a Homegroup
Once the Homegroup is created, it is time to join other computers so that you can 
exchange iles, folders, and devices. Any computer on the network can be part of a 
Homegroup, but they can only be in one Homegroup at a time. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to add a computer running Windows 7 to a previously 
created Homegroup.
SET UP Open the Network and Sharing Center.
 
1.  Click the Homegroup link.
The Homegroup window opens and shows you that one of the computers on your 
network has created a Homegroup.
 
2.  Click Join now.
This opens the Join A Homegroup window, in which you can select the items you 
want to share with the other computers on the Homegroup. A limited list of librar-
ies is available for sharing: Pictures, Documents, Music, and Videos. You can also 
share your printers.

 
Joining a Homegroup  139
See Also  To learn more about libraries in Windows 7, read Chapter 3, “Setting Up Your 
Libraries on All Windows 7 Computers.”
 
3.  Select the items you want to share, then click Next.
A window opens in which you are asked to type the Homegroup password.

140  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers
 
4.  Type the password, then click Next.
Windows 7 notiies you that you have joined the Homegroup.
 
5.  Click Finish.
The computer is now part of the Homegroup and is able to share libraries, iles, folders, 
and devices with the other computers. It can also access the things shared by them.
CLEAN UP Repeat this procedure for all the computers on your home network that 
are running Windows 7.
Accessing Homegroup Computers
Once the Homegroup is created and all computers are joined, accessing their shared 
libraries and devices is a simple task—all it takes is a few clicks. You no longer need to 
type any user names and passwords in order to access what is shared in the Homegroup.
In this exercise, you will learn how to access the libraries, iles, folders, and devices shared 
by other computers in the Homegroup.
SET UP Turn on the computers you want to access.
 
1.  Open the Computer window.
Tip  You can select the Computer shortcut from the Desktop or the Start menu, or by 
pressing Windows+E on your keyboard simultaneously. 

 
Accessing Homegroup Computers  141
The Computer window looks similar to the one shown here.
 
2.  Click Homegroup.
You now see the list of computers that are part of the Homegroup and that are also 
running at the moment.

142  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers
  
3.  Double-click the name of the computer you want to access.
You now see the complete list of libraries, folders, and devices shared by that 
computer.
  
4.  Double-click the library, folder, or device that you want to access.
You now have access to the items that are shared by that computer and can work 
with them according to the deined sharing settings.
Tip  By default, libraries and folders are shared with the other Homegroup computers as 
read-only. Therefore, you will be able to access them or copy them to your computer, but 
you won’t be able to delete them or change them in any way. 
See Also  For more information on permission levels and how to share folders and libraries, 
read Chapter 7, “Sharing Libraries and Folders.”
CLEAN UP When you are done accessing other Homegroup computers, close the 
Computer window.

 
Leaving a Homegroup  143
Leaving a Homegroup
Leaving a Homegroup is as easy as joining one. If you leave a Homegroup, you stop shar-
ing iles, folders, and devices with other members of the group, and you won’t be able 
to access what is shared as part of that Homegroup. After leaving a Homegroup, you can 
create another one, or at any time, rejoin the Homegroup you left. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to leave a Homegroup.
SET UP Open the Network and Sharing Center.
 
1.  Click the Homegroup link found on the lower-left side of the Network and 
Sharing Center window.
The Homegroup window opens.

144  Chapter 6 Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers
 
2.  Click the Leave the Homegroup link.
Windows 7 informs you that all the Homegroup connections on your computer will 
be disconnected.
 
3.  Click Leave the Homegroup.
Windows 7 informs you that you have successfully left the Homegroup.

 
Key Points  145
 
4.  Click Finish.
Your computer is no longer part of the Homegroup.
Tip  If you repeat this procedure on all computers that are part of the Homegroup, the 
Homegroup will no longer exist. This is the only way to “delete” a Homegroup.
CLEAN UP Close the Network and Sharing Center.
Known Issues and Solutions
If you are trying to connect to the Homegroup but you receive an error message 
indicating that “The password is incorrect,” even though you have typed it correctly, 
it means you might have encountered a bug. According to Microsoft, this can hap-
pen because the computer’s date and time does not match the date and time of 
the system that owns the Homegroup. In this case, the only solution is to adjust the 
date and time settings on the computer that is joining the Homegroup to match 
that of the computer that owns the Homegroup, and then try to join again. The 
computer that owns the Homegroup is the one on which it was irst created.
Key Points
 
●The Homegroup is a Windows 7-speciic feature that allows easy sharing of iles, 
folders, libraries, and devices, without requiring you to type user names and pass-
words each time you want to access something that is shared over the network.
 
●The Homegroup is available only for home networks and not for public or work 
networks.
 
●In order to join a Homegroup, you need to know and type the Homegroup pass-
word deined by the computer that created it.
 
●A computer can join only one Homegroup at a time. In order to join another 
Homegroup, the computer needs irst to leave the current one, then join the other.

While developing Windows 7, Microsoft directed a lot of effort toward improving the 
networking experience. Windows Vista was a irst step in the right direction. Windows 7 
raises things to a new level and makes it easier than ever to share iles, folders, libraries, 
and devices with the other computers on your network. 
With the help of ile sharing wizards and the Homegroup feature, it takes only a few 
clicks to share and access the things you want to.
In this chapter, you will learn how to share libraries and folders over your home network 
by using the sharing wizard and the advanced sharing options and menus. You will also 
learn what the Public folder is and how to use it for sharing. At the end of this chapter, 
you will learn how to map a shared folder on your home network as a network drive and 
how to map an FTP site as a network drive.
Practice Files You can use any of your libraries, folders, and iles to complete the 
exercises in this chapter. Until you get the hang of it, it is best not to use any important 
iles. Also, back up the iles and folders you are about to use, just to make sure you don’t 
lose them by mistake.

148  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
Enabling or Disabling the Sharing Wizard
The Sharing Wizard in Windows 7 is designed so that you can easily share anything you 
want with the other computers on your home network. But even though it simpliies the 
sharing experience, some people might prefer the old Windows XP/Windows 2000 way 
of sharing things. In this circumstance, it is best to disable the Sharing Wizard. The pro-
cedure is pretty simple and involves nothing more than editing a coniguration setting in 
Windows Explorer.
In this exercise, you will learn how to enable or disable the Sharing Wizard, depending on 
your preference.
Practice Files No practice iles are required for this exercise.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer or the Computer shortcut.
 
1.  Click the Organize button on the upper-left side of Windows Explorer window.
The Organize menu appears.

150  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
Using the Sharing Wizard to Share with the 
Homegroup
If you have set up a Homegroup and you want to share something with other computers 
that have joined it, the Sharing Wizard makes the procedure extremely simple. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to use the Sharing Wizard to share anything you want 
with your Homegroup.
Practice Files You can use any of your libraries or folders to complete this exercise. Until 
you get the hang of it, it is best not to use any important libraries or folders. Also, back 
up the folders and libraries you are about to use, just to make sure you don’t lose any 
data by mistake.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer or the Computer shortcut.
 
1.   Navigate to the library or folder you want to share and right-click it.
The contextual menu appears.

 
Using the Sharing Wizard to Share with the Homegroup  151
 
2.  Click Share with to open the list of sharing options, which includes the following:
 
●Nobody This option prevents the selected item from being shared. It can 
be useful when you share a library or collection of folders and iles, but you 
don’t want to share a speciic item. For example, you might share your entire 
pictures library, but you want some pictures to remain private while leaving 
the rest accessible to others on your network. By using this option, you can 
quickly ilter out those items from your collection that you don’t want to 
share.
 
●Homegroup (Read) This option shares the selected item with the Home-
group and gives read-only permissions to all computers in the Homegroup. 
The item will be shared only when you are connected to the Homegroup, 
and other computers will only be able to view/read the shared item but not 
modify it, delete it, or change it in any way.
 
●Homegroup (Read/Write) This shares the item with others in your Home-
group and gives full permissions to modify it, delete it, or change it. The item 
will not be shared when you disconnect from the Homegroup or connect to 
another network.
 
●Speciic people This option allows you to share the selected item with 
whomever you want, including computers that are not a part of the Home-
group and speciic user accounts. This option will be described in more detail 
in the next section of this chapter.
 
3.  Select the option that works for you. Depending on the size of the shared library or 
the folder and its contents, you might see a File Sharing progress window. 

152  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
Note  If the shared library or folder is small or contains very few iles, you might not see 
this progress window, and the items will be shared instantly with the Homegroup.
Important  Depending on what you have shared, you might see an additional window, 
asking you to conirm that you want to start sharing. Make the appropriate conirmation 
and you are done. 
 
4.  Wait for the File Sharing progress window to disappear.
The selected library or folder is now shared.
CLEAN UP Repeat the procedure for all the items you want to share. When you have 
inished, close Windows Explorer.
Using the Sharing Wizard to Share with  
Speciic People
If you have computers that are not running Windows 7, you can use the Sharing Wizard 
to share libraries and folders with them. However, the procedure is slightly longer than 
when sharing items with the Homegroup. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to use the Sharing Wizard to share libraries and folders 
with people using operating systems other than Windows 7.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer or the Computer shortcut.
 
1.  Navigate to the library or folder that you want to share and right-click it.
The contextual menu appears.

Note  The drop-down menu shows all the user accounts deined on your computer, the 
Homegroup you have joined, and a user account called Everyone. The Homegroup user 
represents all the computers from your Homegroup, while Everyone is a generic user 
account—this is any user on the list.
 
4.  Select the user account with which you want to share.
 
5.  Click Add.
This adds the selected user account to the list below the drop-down menu.

156  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
 
6.  Repeat steps 3 to 5 until you add all the user accounts with which you want to 
share.

item. If you want to change that, click the Permission Level assigned.
A list appears showing the available permission levels you can assign.

 
Using the Sharing Wizard to Share with Speciic People   157
 
8.  Select the desired permission level for each of the user accounts with which you 
want to share the item.
 
9.  When done adding user accounts and setting permission levels, click Share.
If you are trying to assign permissions to a library that contains many folders, you 
might receive a request for conirmation.

158  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
Note  This window might not appear if you shared a library containing only one folder.
 
10.  Click Next.
If you are not asked to conirm the access permissions to the shared item, skip to 
the next step.
After a few seconds, you are informed that the selected item (library or folder) has 
been shared.

 
Using the Sharing Wizard to Stop Sharing  159
Tip  If problems occur when trying to share the selected library or folder, you will see a 
message at the bottom similar to the following: “1 error(s) occurred when sharing this 
library (or folder).” If you click the error message, you can view details about the root 
cause of the problem so that you can ix it and try again.

have inished, close Windows Explorer.
Using the Sharing Wizard to Stop Sharing
At some point in your home networking experience, you might want to stop sharing a 
folder or library. To discontinue sharing an item, you have the following options:
 
●Stop sharing it with everybody on the home network.
 
●Stop sharing it with the Homegroup.
 
●Stop sharing it with a speciic user account.

160  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
In this exercise, you will learn how to use the Sharing Wizard to discontinue sharing 
an item.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer or the Computer shortcut.
 
1.  Navigate to the library or folder that you want to stop sharing and right-click it.
The contextual menu appears.
 
2.  Click Share with, and then choose Speciic people.

Using the Sharing Wizard to Stop Sharing  161
 
3.  If you want to stop sharing with a speciic user account only, click on the Permis-
sion Level column of that user and select Remove. If you select the Homegroup 
user account, you will stop sharing with all the computers on your Homegroup. 
If you select the Everyone user account, you will stop sharing with the users who 
don’t have an account on your computer.
Tip  If you want to completely discontinue sharing the item so that only you have access 
to it, select Remove for all the user accounts in the list, except your user account.
 
4.  Once you are done selecting the user account with which you want to stop sharing, 
click Share.
After a few seconds, you are notiied that the selected item (library or folder) is now 
shared. Don’t be fooled by the message. It simply means that the item is shared 
with the new list of user accounts. If you removed all the user accounts except 
yours, this means the item is actually no longer shared.

162  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
Tip  If problems occur during the procedure, you will see a message at the bottom of the 
screen similar to the following: “1 error(s) occurred when sharing this library (or folder).” 
If you click the error message, you can view details about the root cause of the problem 
so that you can ix it and try again.
 
5.  Click Done.
The selected library or folder is no longer shared with the user accounts you 
selected.
CLEAN UP Repeat the procedure for all the items that you want to stop sharing. 
When you have inished, close Windows Explorer.
Using Advanced Sharing to Share Your  
Folders or Partitions
If you want to have more control over how you share a folder and who can access 
it, you might prefer to use Advanced Sharing instead of the Sharing Wizard. With 
Advanced Sharing, you can set options in more detail. The downside is that you cannot 
use Advanced Sharing to share libraries. For an unknown technical reason, you can use 
Advanced Sharing to share only folders or partitions, but not libraries.
In this exercise, you will learn how to share a folder or partition using Advanced Sharing.
SET UP Disable the Sharing Wizard and then open Windows Explorer or the 
Computer shortcut.

 
Using Advanced Sharing to Share Your Folders or Partitions   163
 
1.  Navigate to the folder or partition that you want to share and right-click it.
The contextual menu appears.
 
2.  Click Share with, then choose Advanced sharing.

step.
 
13.  Select the type of permissions for each of the user accounts or user groups. Choose 
the access level you want to assign to each user or group by selecting the appropriate 
check box:
 
●Full Control This setting is self-explanatory. With this level assigned, users 
or groups who have access to this shared folder can do anything they desire: 
view, modify, delete, and so on.
 
●Change With this level assigned, users or groups can change contents of the 
shared folder but cannot delete any of its content.
 
●Read With this level assigned, users or groups can only view the existing 
content without being able to make any changes to it.
 
14.  When you have inished, click OK.
You are returned to the Advanced Sharing window.

continue sharing it so that they can save and close any work that is at that location. 
When you have inished notifying any affected users, click Yes.
You are returned to the Properties window of the selected folder or partition.
 
7.  Click Close.
The selected folder or partition is no longer shared.

172  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
CLEAN UP Repeat the procedure for all the items you want to share. When you have 
inished, close Windows Explorer.
Note  If you want to stop sharing a folder or partition only with a certain user account or user 
group, follow the procedure detailed in the “Using Advanced Sharing to Share Your Folders or 
Partitions” section on page 162 and pay special attention to step 12.
Using the Public Folder for Sharing
In the “Coniguring the Network Sharing Settings” section in Chapter 5, “Customiz-
ing Network Sharing Settings in Windows 7,” there is mention of enabling the Pub-
lic folder for sharing. When turned on, the C:\Users\Public\ folder is shared with all 
the computers on the network. This folder contains the following subfolders: Public 
Documents, Public Downloads, Public Music, Public Pictures, and Public Videos. 
These folders contain some sample iles of music, pictures, and videos. The Public 
folder also contains a series of hidden folders such as: Favorites, Libraries, and Pub-
lic Desktop. By default, these folders are empty.
Users from the other computers can read its contents and write iles inside this 
folder and its subfolders. When turned off, this folder is not shared with your 
network.

 
Mapping a Shared Network Folder as a Network Drive   173
Using the Public folder is a matter of choice and personal style, and in certain 
scenarios, it can be useful. For example, if multiple people are using the same  
computer—each person with his own user account—you can use the Public folder 
to share iles between all these user accounts. Everything you place inside this 
folder will be accessible to other user accounts.
The Public folder can also be used for sharing iles with other computers on your 
network. If you choose to share this folder, other computers can access its contents.
Recommendation  Use Public folder sharing if
• 
You want to share iles from a single location for ease of management.
• 
You want to keep everything you share separate from your personal data.
• 
It is okay to apply the same permissions for all users of your home network.
Note  By default, the Public folder is not shared unless you are connected to a 
Homegroup. To stop sharing this folder, you need to follow the instructions found in the 
“Coniguring the Network Sharing Settings” section in Chapter 5, “Customizing Network 
Sharing Settings in Windows 7”.
Mapping a Shared Network Folder  
as a Network Drive
Drive mapping is the procedure by which you can associate a local drive letter (for 
example, A to Z, just like your disk drives) with an area on another network computer 
(for example, a shared folder) or Internet location (for example, an FTP site). Using drive 
mappings can be very useful, especially when working with different operating systems 
on the same network. For example, if you use both Windows 7 and Windows XP in your 
home network, you cannot take full advantage of the Homegroup feature. Using drive 
mappings can be a pretty good alternative because you can easily access the shared 
folders from the other computer.
In this exercise, you will learn how to map a shared folder from another computer as a 
network drive on your Windows 7 computer.
SET UP Open Windows Explorer or the Computer shortcut.
 
1.  At the top of the window, in the toolbar, click the Map network drive button. If 
you cannot see it, maximize the window and it will appear.
The Map Network Drive Wizard opens.

174  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
Tip  An alternative to start the Map Network Drive Wizard is to right-click on the 
Computer shortcut, then select Map Network Drive.
 
2.  Click the Drive drop-down list.
A list opens showing the available letters that you can assign to the network drive.

 
Mapping a Shared Network Folder as a Network Drive   175
 
3.  Select the drive letter you want to assign.
 
4.  In the Folder ield, click Browse.
The Browse For Folder window opens, in which you can select the shared folder 
that you want to map.
 
5.  Wait until all the computers on your network are displayed, then browse to the 
computer where the shared folder is found.
 
6.  If the computer you want to access is set to allow access to a user account only 
after a password is provided, a Windows Security window pops up. 
You are asked to type a user account and password that has access to that com-
puter. If you don’t see this window, skip to step 11.

176  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
 
7.  In the irst ield, type the name of the computer to which you want to connect. Type 
a \ (the backslash character) and a user account deined on that computer.
For example, if you want to connect to a computer called Ciprian-PC, which has 
Ciprian as a user account deined on it, type Ciprian-PC\Ciprian.
 
8.  In the second ield, type the password for that user account.
 
9.  Select the Remember my credentials check box so that you are not asked to type 
the user account and password each time you want to access it.
 
10.  Click OK.
You are returned to the Browse For Folder window.
 
11.  Select the folder that you want to map and click OK.
You are returned to the Map Network Drive Wizard.
 
12.  Select the Reconnect at logon check box.
This allows your computer to automatically connect to the shared folder and make 
it accessible as a network drive each time you log on.

 
Mapping a Shared Network Folder as a Network Drive   177
 
13.  If your user account doesn’t have access to the shared folder, select the Connect 
using different credentials check box.
 
14.  Click Finish.
A Windows Security window appears, in which you are asked to type a user name 
and password in order to access the shared folder. In this window, by default, the 
last user account you used to access shared folders on the remote network com-
puter will be selected.
 
15.  If the user speciied is correct, simply type the password and select the Remember 
my credentials check box.
Important  Pay attention to the computer name speciied before the user name. 
If it is your computer name and not that of the remote computer that is sharing 
the folder, then the drive mapping won’t work. In such a scenario, select Use 
Another Account and follow steps 6 to 10 in this exercise to type the correct user 
name and password.
 
16.  Click OK.
After a while, the shared folder is mapped and opened in a Windows Explorer 
window.

178  Chapter 7 Sharing Libraries and Folders
Now, each time you log on, the shared network folder will be mapped on your computer 
as a local drive.
CLEAN UP Close the Computer and Windows Explorer windows.
Mapping an FTP Server as a Network Drive
Depending on your needs, it can be a good idea to map an FTP server as a network drive 
so that you can easily access it whenever you need it. This is very useful if you want to 
connect to a Web site that you own so you can manage the iles and folders that reside 
on the hosting provider’s servers, or if you want to connect to an FTP server at work 
to share iles and documents with your coworkers. The procedure for mapping an FTP 
server is different; however, there’s nothing complicated about it.
In this exercise, you will learn how to map an FTP server as a network drive in Windows 7.

In this chapter, you will learn how to
4 Share a printer with computers on your home network.
4 Enable Bluetooth on your computer and allow connections.
4 Pair your computer with your mobile phone.
4 Exchange iles between your computer and your mobile phone.
4 Remove the pairing between your computer and your mobile phone.
In the previous chapter, you learned how to share libraries, folders, and iles with the 
computers on your home network. Fortunately, the list of things you can share on your 
network does not end here. You can also share some of the devices connected to your 
computer, the most common being the printer. Other devices include scanners, remov-
able disk drives (such as USB memory sticks), or external hard disk drives.
Another positive is that you can connect yet more devices to the computers on your net-
work and transfer iles between them. One great example is your mobile phone. With the 
use of Bluetooth technology, you can connect your laptop or notebook with your mobile 
phone and exchange iles among them (photos, short videos, music, and so on).
In this chapter, you will learn how to share a printer with the network or Homegroup and 
how to stop sharing it when you no longer need to use it as a network printer. Then, you 
will learn how to share a removable disk drive and how to transfer iles between your 
mobile phones and your Windows 7 computers using Bluetooth.
Practice Files You can use any of your printers, phones, and iles to complete the 
exercises in this chapter. Until you get the hang of it, it is best not to use any important 
iles. Also, back up the iles you are about to use, just to make sure you don’t lose them 
by mistake.

Chapter 8 Sharing and Working with Devices
Sharing a Printer with Computers on  
Your Home Network
In Chapter 1, we talked a lot about Device Stage and how this feature allows you to 
interact with all the external devices attached to your computer. This feature comes in 
handy, especially when working with printers. Your printer is accessible in the Devices 
And Printers panel. From here, you can perform all the coniguration tasks, including 
sharing it with the other computers on your home network.
In this exercise, you will learn how to share a printer with your network in Windows 7. 
The exercise and illustrations were created using an HP Photosmart C5280 printer, but 
the same steps apply to any model of printer.
SET UP Connect the printer to your computer, start it, and install the latest drivers 
for it.
 
1.  Open the Start Menu and click Devices and Printers.
The Devices And Printers panel opens, in which you can access all the external 
devices connected to your computer, including your printer.

it, type a new share name.
 
8.  If you want a negligible performance increase on your computer, check Render 
print jobs on client computers.
When this option is enabled, printing jobs are no longer rendered on the computer 
to which the printer is attached but on the computers ordering the printing jobs. 
This prevents any performance impact on the host computer when the client 
computers start printing large iles. However, modern computers are very powerful 
and the performance impact of this setting is negligible. It is up to you whether you 
want this setting enabled.
 
9.  Click OK.
The printer is now shared with the computers on your network and they can install 
it and use it.
CLEAN UP Close Devices And Printers.

 
Sharing a Printer with Your Homegroup  195
Sharing a Printer with Your Homegroup
Sharing a printer with the Homegroup is extremely easy. Simply open the Home-
group settings window and, in the Share Libraries And Printers section, check Print-
ers, and then click Save Changes.
See Also For more information about the Homegroup and how to ind its settings window, 
see Chapter 6, “Creating the Homegroup and Joining Windows 7 Computers.”
The printer will automatically show up in the Devices And Printers panel of all the 
computers that are part of the Homegroup and they will be able to use it.

Chapter 8 Sharing and Working with Devices
Stop Sharing the Printer
If you want to discontinue sharing the printer with the network, follow steps 1 to 5, 
detailed in the “Sharing a Printer with Computers on Your Home Network” section on 
page 190. Clear the Share This Printer check box, then click OK.
The printer is no longer shared with the other computers on the network. This procedure 
stops sharing the printer with computers that are not a part of the Homegroup and that 
are running operating systems other than Windows 7. To stop sharing a printer with the 
Homegroup, open the Homegroup settings window, and in the Share Libraries And Print-
ers section, clear the Printers check box, then click Save Changes.

 
Sharing a Removable Disk Drive  197
See Also  For more information about the Homegroup and how to ind its settings window, see 
Chapter 6.
The printer will no longer show up in the Devices And Printers panel of all the computers 
that are a part of the Homegroup.
Sharing a Removable Disk Drive
Removable disk drives (such as USB memory sticks or external hard disk drives con-
nected through USB) are another type of device that you can share on your network. 
Sharing such devices is relatively easy—simply follow the instructions found in the “Using 

198   
Chapter 8 Sharing and Working with Devices
Advanced Sharing to Share Your Folders or Partitions” section in Chapter 7, “Sharing 
Libraries and Folders.”
Unfortunately, sharing disk drives of any type cannot be done using the simple Sharing 
Wizard found in Windows 7. You can only share them by using Advanced Sharing.
Transferring Files Between Mobile Phones and  
Your Windows 7 Computer via Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a popular wireless technology used to exchange data between devices over 
short distances. One very common use for it is transferring iles between two mobile 
phones or between a mobile phone and a laptop or netbook computer. An important 
downside of Bluetooth support for Windows 7 is the fact that some manufacturers do 
not provide full support for Windows 7 in their drivers. Therefore, you might experience 
problems connecting your mobile phone to your Windows 7 computer. This is especially 
true for older or less expensive mobile phones. Newer, more popular and expensive 
models generally beneit from good support and drivers that enable successful connec-
tions to Windows 7 computers.
Before trying to connect your computer to your mobile phone, it is highly recommended 
that you install the latest drivers for the Bluetooth device on your computer and the 
latest drivers for your phone. These usually come packaged in the PC suites created by 
the manufacturer of your phone (for example: Nokia Ovi Suite, Sony Ericsson PC Suite, 
Motorola Phone Tools, or Samsung PC Studio). Another aspect worth keeping in mind 
is that desktop computers generally are not equipped with Bluetooth devices, so you 
cannot use them to establish such connections. If you want to establish Bluetooth con-
nections on your desktop computer, you need to purchase and install a separate adapter.
Also, not all mobile computers such as laptops or notebooks have Bluetooth devices. 
Therefore, it is best for you to check the coniguration of your speciic model and conirm 
whether it has Bluetooth support. If it does have a Bluetooth device, then read the next 
sections.
If your computer does not have a Bluetooth device, then your only solution is to connect 
your mobile phone via a computer cable. This is usually provided by the manufacturer of 
your phone in the original packaging.

 
Enabling Bluetooth on Your Computer and Allowing Connections   199
See Also  For instructions on how to connect your mobile phone to your computer via the 
computer cable, check the manual for your speciic model.
Assuming that you have a Bluetooth device on your computer and the latest drivers are 
installed, you need to follow a series of steps—in the correct order—before you begin 
transferring anything via Bluetooth. These steps are covered comprehensively in the next 
sections, so read them carefully; otherwise, you might run into some problems.
Enabling Bluetooth on Your Computer and  
Allowing Connections
The irst task is to enable Bluetooth, both on your computer and on your mobile phone. 
The procedure is not very complicated, but it does require attention—especially during 
the setup process—so pay attention to the steps described in this chapter.
In this exercise, you will learn how to enable Bluetooth on your Windows 7 laptop or 
netbook. You will also learn how to set it to allow connections from other devices such 
as your mobile phone.
Bluetooth Turned Off
Bluetooth Turned On
SET UP Install all the drivers provided by the manufacturer of your laptop, including 
those for Bluetooth. Then, make sure the Bluetooth device is turned on. To turn it on, 
locate the button on the side of your computer or above its keyboard. Typically, you 
can determine whether Bluetooth is enabled by an illuminated Bluetooth LED icon 
on the surface of your laptop or netbook. In addition, the Bluetooth icon from the 
taskbar turns from red (or completely missing) to white.
See Also  For complete instructions on how to turn on the Bluetooth device on your laptop or 
netbook, read the instruction manual provided by the manufacturer.
 
1.  Go to the notiication area of the Windows 7 taskbar and open the list of icons.
 
2.  Right-click the Bluetooth icon.
The contextual menu, which contains a list of Bluetooth-related coniguration 
options, opens.

If this setting is not enabled, other devices will not be able to connect to your 
computer.
 
6.  Select Alert me when a new Bluetooth devices wants to connect.
With this setting enabled, you are notiied when new—and possibly unauthorized—
devices want to connect to your computer, which allows you to act, if needed.
 
7.  Select Show the Bluetooth icon in the notiication area.
This allows you to easily access the Bluetooth capabilities on your computer and 
use them as required.
 
8.  Click OK.
The Bluetooth on your computer is now enabled, correctly conigured, and ready to 
establish connections to and interact with other devices.
CLEAN UP No cleanup is required.
Turning On Bluetooth on Your Mobile Phone
Now that your computer is correctly conigured, it’s time to turn on Bluetooth on your 
mobile phone. How to do this depends on the type of phone you have. We will try to 
help by sharing a few examples.
On smartphones running the Android operating system (version 2.1 or 2.2), go to Set-
tings -> Wireless & Networks, and then simply select the Bluetooth check box.
On Sony Ericsson phones, go to Settings -> Connectivity -> Bluetooth, and then choose 
Turn On.
For Nokia phones (which are more popular in Europe), the setup is very similar to Sony 
Ericsson: go to Settings -> Connectivity -> Bluetooth. Here you simply need to change 
the value of the Bluetooth ield to On.
See Also  If you can’t ind the Bluetooth settings on your phone, consult the instruction manual 
for guidance on how to turn it on.

Chapter 8 Sharing and Working with Devices
Pairing Your Computer with Your Mobile Phone, 
Starting from Your Phone
Before being able to transfer iles, you need to pair the devices together. This procedure 
can be started from your mobile phone or from your computer. The end result is the 
same, so you can choose which one works best for you.
In this exercise, you will learn how to pair your computer with your mobile phone,  
starting from your phone.
SET UP Go to the Bluetooth coniguration menu on your phone.
 
1.  Set your phone to scan for Bluetooth devices.
This option is found in the same Bluetooth menus. On Nokia phones, go to Paired 
Devices -> Add New Device. On Android phones, go to Bluetooth Settings -> Scan 
For Devices. On Sony Ericsson phones, go to Bluetooth -> My Devices -> New 
Device. A scan process starts, and after a few seconds, the phone shows the results.

6.  Depending on your phone and how it is conigured, the ile transfer starts immedi-
ately and without user input, or it stops until you conirm on your phone that you 
want to allow the transfer. For example, on our Nokia phones, the transfer started 
immediately, while on our Android-based smartphones, we needed to conirm the 
transfer before it started.
Once the ile transfer inishes, you are notiied of its success.
 
7.  Click Finish.
The ile is now transferred to your phone.
CLEAN UP If you have inished transferring iles, it is better to turn off Bluetooth

Windows Media Player in its different incarnations has always been the default media 
player for Microsoft Windows operating systems. With this application, users are able to 
listen to music, play movies or DVDs, and view pictures and other types of media, such as 
recorded TV shows, for example.
Windows 7 ships with the new Windows Media Player 12, which looks and feels very 
similar to Windows Media Player 11, but has a few new tweaks and additions. The 
interface has been somewhat pared down and the tabbed navigation of Windows Media 
Player 11 has been replaced with a separate Now Playing view and a collapsible, tabbed 
list pane on the right side for playlists, burning, and syncing. Perhaps most signiicant is 
the functionality with the new Windows 7 taskbar, which lets you control playback with 
the Windows Media Player 12 minimized. Another great feature of the new version is the 
fact that you can use it to stream media over your home network and the Internet.
In this chapter, you will learn how to use Windows Media Player 12, add iles to your 
media libraries, create playlists, and use the search, sort, and view functionalities. You will 

216  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
also learn some useful keyboard shortcuts that you can use to improve your productivity 
when working with Windows Media Player 12. Last but not least, you will learn how to 
stream your media between the computers on your home network and over the Internet.
Practice Files You can use any of your media iles to complete the exercises in this 
chapter.
Setting Up Windows Media Player 12
When you irst run Windows Media Player 12, you’ll be asked to set some coniguration 
settings about how this application is going to be enabled on your computer and how it 
is going to function.
In this exercise, you will learn how to set up Windows Media Player 12 when you start it 
for the irst time, using your own custom settings instead of the recommended defaults.
SET UP Open Windows Media Player 12.
 
1.  The Windows Media Player 12 setup window opens, displaying the initial settings.
You can choose between Recommended settings and Custom settings. Recom-
mended settings means that all the default settings will be applied without you 
having any control over the setup. Custom settings means you can deine all 
the important settings about how Windows Media Player 12 will work on your 
computer.

Tip  You can also click the Cookies button and customize settings that affect cookies 
and what information is transmitted over the Web to the content providers with whom 
you will be working. However, it is best to leave those settings to their default because 
they will be applied to other Web sites as well, and it will also impact your browsing 
experience in Internet Explorer.

Note  If you select Media Guide, you will be asked to select between a list of available 
stores. From there forward, the steps vary depending on the store. Make sure you follow 
the instructions, and you will be set up in no time. Also, be aware that setting up a store 
means that you will likely be requested to provide details such as your bank card number, 
and so on.
 
15.  Click Finish.
Windows Media Player 12 now starts and is set up according to your needs.
CLEAN UP If you don’t plan to use Windows Media Player 12 for now, close it; 
otherwise, keep it turned on.
Adding Files to Your Windows Media  
Player 12 Library
Now that you have done the initial setup of Windows Media Player 12, it is time to set 
up your media library and start using this application to play your media iles. Windows 
Media Player 12 takes you directly to the Library view. This is your main command center 
and, for now, will only contain the songs that come standard with your Windows 7 
installation.

your music collection is. When you come back, you’ll see your library, replete with 
all of your tunes.

226  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
Your music library is now added to Windows Media Player 12, and you can start 
playing it at any time.
Tip  If you want to also add your videos, pictures, and recorded TV shows to the media 
library, repeat the same steps but select the corresponding option at step 2, depending 
on what you’re adding.
CLEAN UP Close Windows Media Player 12 when you are done using it.
The Navigation Pane, Back/Forward Buttons, and Breadcrumbs
Now that you have set up your library, it is time to learn how to navigate your way 
through Windows Media Player 12. When you click on a media type (for example, 
Music, Pictures, Video) in the Navigation Pane on the left side of the Windows 
Media Player 12 window, it will expand to show the subcategorizations. If you click 
Artist, it will list your music iles by artist. As you move deeper into your library, 
you’ll also notice the Breadcrumbs along the top of the screen. In the screenshot 
that follows, they read Library -> Music -> Artist.

Searching in Windows Media Player 12
If you have an extensive library of music, videos, or pictures, it won’t be very easy to 
quickly ind what you want to play or view. The best way to ind something fast is to use 
the search functionality.
In this exercise, you will learn how to use the search functionality in Windows Media 
Player 12.
SET UP Open Windows Media Player 12.
 
1.  For this exercise, let’s search through the music library for a speciic artist. Click 
Music and select the Artist view.
This shows the entire list of artists found in your music library.
Search box

2.  In the Search box located on the upper-right side of the Windows Media Player 12 
window, type the name of the artist that you want to play.

 
Searching in Windows Media Player 12  229
 
3.  Windows Media Player 12 instantly narrows your choices as you type. If your par-
ticular view does not contain any matches, Windows Media Player 12 will point you 
toward other matches in your library.
 
4.  Click the links below Matches in your library for. Clicking Artist will show the list 
of artists matching your search, Albums will return the list of albums, and Songs 
will return the list of songs found.
CLEAN UP Close Windows Media Player 12 when you are done using it.
Working with View Options and Sorting
There are three different View options for Windows Media Player 12: Icon, Tile, and 
Details. You can choose one by clicking the arrow next to the View Options button 
or scroll through them by clicking the button itself. 

230  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
View Options button
These views behave very similarly to the views in Windows Explorer. Let’s see each 
view in action:
 
●Icon view This view is pretty self-explanatory. The only details shown are the 
ile name and the album covers (if you have them downloaded). How much 
information is displayed below the album cover depends on which level of the 
library you’re viewing. For example, in the screenshot following, we are at the 
Album level, so it shows the artist name below the album name (if available). 
When viewing the Artist level, only the album name is displayed. 

 
Searching in Windows Media Player 12  231
 
●Tile View This is a sort of hybrid between Icon and Details. You’ll see the 
album artwork in addition to a bit more information displayed to the right. 
In the Album level, you see the artist name, album name, genre, and year. In 
the Artist view, you also see the number of songs and length. If the album has 
been rated, this information will also be displayed. 

232  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
 
●Details View This is the most customizable view and the most powerful for 
sorting and searching. It allows you to see the category columns and quickly 
sort your songs according to these columns. Click the column once to sort the 
items in ascending order. Click it again to sort it in descending order. 

 
Searching in Windows Media Player 12  233
v
You’ll notice that some View options aren’t available at certain levels in the Library. 
For example, you cannot use Tile or Details view at the top (Library) level, nor can 
you use Icon when viewing from the Music level.
With all three View options, you can change the way the items are sorted by click-
ing the appropriate category column. For example, click Album once to sort the items 
in ascending order based on album name. Click Album again to sort the items in 
descending order by album name.

234  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
Switching Between View Modes
When you open it, Windows Media Player 12 operates by default in the Player 
Library view mode. From the left side you can access your media libraries, and 
based on your selections, the middle section of the window changes to show you 
the content. 
No matter where you are in the Player Library view mode, you will be able to see 
the Playback controls. The function of each of these buttons is annotated in the 
following screenshot.

Searching in Windows Media Player 12  235
While this view works for most purposes, there are also two additional view modes 
available: Skin mode and Now Playing mode. Let’s see the differences between 
them:
 
●Now Playing This is a compact mode designed to sit unobtrusively on your 
desktop. By default, Now Playing mode shows the album artwork, but you can 
also have it display visualizations (as shown in the screenshot that follows). If 
you have lyrics downloaded, they will also appear here. The play controls, as 
always, are embedded at the bottom and you can switch back to the Player 
Library view mode by clicking the icon in the upper-right corner. 
 
●Skin This mode displays the player in the customized skin you’ve chosen. 
The appearance and layout will vary depending on the selected skin. The  
following screenshot shows the Revert skin. 
You can switch to any of the modes by right-clicking a blank area anywhere in 
Windows Media Player 12, selecting View, and then the desired view mode.

236  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet

Important  In order for streaming to work between two or more computers, they all need to 
be running Windows 7, with the network location set as Home and the Homegroup set up and 
joined by all computers.
Setting Up Media Streaming with the Homegroup
The irst step in streaming your media library over the network is to set up media 
streaming with the Homegroup on the computers that you want to use for this activity.
In this exercise, you will learn how to set up media streaming with the Homegroup.
SET UP Open Windows Media Player 12 and use the Player Library view mode
 
1.  Click Stream.
A list opens that displays options related to media streaming.

252  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
 
2.  Click Turn on media streaming with HomeGroup.
Windows 7 now briefs you on the security implications of enabling media stream-
ing. Essentially, enabling media streaming will modify your irewall settings to allow 
access from networked computers. For this reason, we don’t recommend enabling 
media streaming unless you are on a secure network that you trust (for instance, 
avoid enabling network media streaming if you are on a public wireless network, 
such as at a café, library, airport, and so on).
 
3.  Click Turn on media streaming.
The Media Streaming Options window opens.

 
Setting Up Media Streaming with the Homegroup  253
 
4.  In the Name your media library ield, type the name you want to use for your 
media library.
This is how your media library is identiied when other computers on the network 
connect to it.
 
5.  In the Show devices on drop-down list, choose Local network.
This reveals all the computers that have successfully connected to the Homegroup.

254  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
 
6.  Now it is time to set which devices on your network you want to be able to access 
your media library. For each of the computers shown, you can allow or block access. 
Select Allowed for the computers that you want to allow access to your media 
library and Blocked for those computers that you do not.
 
7.  For the computers for which you selected Allowed, you can further customize 
access by clicking Customize.
The Customize Media Streaming Settings window opens.

 
Setting Up Media Streaming with the Homegroup  255
 
8.  You can ilter what is streamed to the selected computer based on star or parental 
ratings (in case you don’t want your children to access certain types of media).

Displaying Remote Media Libraries in the Navigation Pane
Once you have set up media streaming with the Homegroup on all computers, you can 
access remote media libraries directly from Windows Media Player 12. All you need to 
do is open the application and look at the bottom portion of the Navigation Pane. In the 
Other Libraries section, you should see a list with all the computers that are turned on 
and sharing their media library with the Homegroup. Accessing their media libraries is as 
simple as clicking on these computers and browsing with the mouse.

256  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
However, chances are you won’t be able to see the media libraries of other computers 
because of how your Windows Media Player 12 is set up.
In this exercise, you will learn how to customize the navigation pane so that it shows the 
media libraries shared by other computers on the Homegroup or the Internet.
SET UP Open Windows Media Player 12.

Navigation Pane.
CLEAN UP Repeat this procedure for any other computers that you want conigured 
in this manner.
Allowing Remote Control and Enabling 
the ”Play To” Functionality
Another option that is handy for sharing media libraries is remote control. With this 
option enabled, you can play songs from your computer to others on the Homegroup. 
For example, if you have a living room computer hooked up to your entertainment sys-
tem, you can play songs from your netbook via the network using Remote Control and 
the Play To functionality.
In this exercise, you will learn how to allow remote control of a computer and enable the 
Play To functionality.

264  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
Streaming Your Windows Media Player 12  
Library Over the Internet
Windows Media Player 12 has another cool feature that allows you to play your entire 
media library from any Windows 7 computer over the Internet. And that means every-
thing: songs, videos, photos, even purchased media. This is useful for when you want to 
enjoy your Windows Media Player 12 library at the ofice, on your laptop, or simply from 
another computer in your home.
In order to take advantage of this feature to its fullest, you need to set a series of con-
igurations. Let’s look at them one by one.
Important  In order for remote streaming via the Internet to work between two or more 
computers, they all need to be running Windows 7, and media streaming must be enabled in 
Windows Media Player 12.
Creating and Linking an Online ID for  
Remote Media Streaming
The irst step in setting up remote media streaming over the Internet is to set up an 
Online ID by downloading the appropriate software from Microsoft. This online ID pro-
vider software, called Windows Live ID Sign-in, simply lets you link one of your online 
accounts (such as the one you use for email and instant messaging) to your Windows 7 
user accounts. At the time of this writing, you can only link your Windows Live account, 
but there are plans to roll out other online ID providers (such as Google,  
OpenID, and Facebook). The Online ID you set up needs to then be linked with the user 
account on your Windows 7 computer. Once this link is set up, you can start using 
remote media streaming.
In this exercise, you will learn how to install the Online ID software from Microsoft, set it 
up, and link it to a user account from a Windows 7 computer.
SET UP Go to the Windows 7 online ID providers Web site at http://windows
.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/OnlineIDProviders.
 
1.  On the Windows 7 online ID providers page, you can see two download buttons: 
one for 32-bit editions of Windows 7 and the other for 64-bit editions.

 
Streaming Your Windows Media Player 12 Library Over the Internet   265

The second important step is to allow Internet access to home media on the computer 
where you keep your media iles. Obviously, your host machine should be connected to 
the Internet, and you should already have some folders added to your Music, Pictures, or 
Videos libraries.
In this exercise, you will learn how to allow Internet access to your home media in Windows 
Media Player 12.

CLEAN UP Repeat this procedure on any computers for which you want remote 
media streaming functionality.
Playing Media Remotely over the Internet
Now that you have set up Internet access of your media, you can start playing it when-
ever you want to. In order for remote media playing to work, your remote host computer 
needs to be turned on and Windows Media Player 12 must be launched.
In this exercise, you will learn how to play remote media over the Internet in Windows 
Media Player 12.
SET UP Open Windows Media Player 12 and use the Player Library view mode.
 
1.  In the Navigation Pane, go to the Other Libraries section.
Here you should see all the computers and libraries that are available for media 
streaming, both from your network and the Internet.

276  Chapter 9 Streaming Media Over the Network and the Internet
The libraries that are available for remote streaming over the Internet have a 
slightly different icon and use the format: User + Name of the User on that PC + 
name of the PC. In our example, it is User 7 Tutorials (ciprian-pc).
 
2.  Click the remote computer you want to access.
 
3.  Browse its media library and play the items that you are interested in listening to or 
viewing.
CLEAN UP Close Windows Media Player 12 when you are done using it.
Troubleshooting  If you are using a router for your home network and Windows Media Player 
12 doesn’t display the remote computers and their libraries, it means you need to map ports 
44442 to 10245 and 443 to 10245 on your router. To learn more about how to troubleshoot this 
problem, see Chapter 15, “Troubleshooting Network and Internet Problems.”

Sharing folders and printers between Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP is not 
as easy as it should be, particularly as they all are Microsoft operating systems. Before 
being able to share anything between these operating systems, you need to make sure 
that the network and sharing settings are conigured correctly on all computers and that 
they all joined the same workgroup.

280  Chapter 10 Sharing Between Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 Computers
In this chapter, you will irst learn how to set up Windows XP and Windows Vista so that 
you can share folders with other Windows computers. You will then learn how to access 
these shared folders and also how to access a Windows 7 shared printer from both Win-
dows XP and Windows Vista so that you can print the iles you need.
Practice Files You can use any of your folders on your Windows XP or Windows Vista 
computer to complete the exercises in this chapter. Until you get the hang of it, it is best 
not to use any important folders. Also, back up the iles and folders you are about to 
use, just to make sure you don’t lose them by mistake.

Services in Windows XP
The Computer Browser service allows your Windows XP computer to detect the comput-
ers on your network and maintain the list of active network computers continuously. The 
Printer Spooler service is useful if you plan to use a printer on your network because it 
allows you to interact with printers and use them to print your documents.
By default, these services are enabled in Windows XP. However, depending on how your 
Windows XP has been conigured, it’s possible that they are disabled. That’s why it is bet-
ter to check and conirm that these services are enabled and set to start automatically at 
each logon.

everyone has access to them.

 
Installing Drivers for a Shared Network Printer in Windows XP   295
CLEAN UP When you have inished, close the Computer or Windows Explorer 
window.
Installing Drivers for a Shared Network Printer  
in Windows XP
Installing a network printer is a process that varies greatly depending on the manufac-
turer of the printer. If you are using Windows XP and the printer is connected to another 
computer and shared with the network, you need to irst install the Windows XP drivers 
for the printer. Some drivers allow the detection of network printers, and when you install 
them, you set up everything in one pass. Other drivers do not. If the driver does not 
allow the detection of shared network printers, you need to irst install the driver, then 
manually add the printer using the Add a Printer Wizard.
To further complicate matters, the setup of a printer driver is different, based on the 
manufacturer and the model you have. Also, the number of steps is almost never the 
same. However, the basic principles apply to all setup programs provided by the different 
printer manufacturers.
In this exercise, you will learn how to install the drivers for a printer in Windows XP using 
the setup program provided by the manufacturer of the printer. For the purposes of this 
exercise, we are using the setup for the HP Photosmart C5280 printer.
SET UP Write down the manufacturer of the shared network printer and its exact 
model.
 
1.  Download the Windows XP driver from the Web site of the company that manufac-
tured your printer. 

296  Chapter 10 Sharing Between Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 Computers
Printer drivers are typically provided as a self-extracting archive ile and include the 
“.exe” extension in their ile name.
 
2.  Run the printer driver setup ile.
The self-extraction process starts. Usually, the driver setup displays a progress window.
Tip  Some drivers ask you to choose where you want the extracted iles to be placed. 
Others simply start the self-extraction process without asking. If you are asked for a 
location, select the folder where you want the driver to reside, then click the Unzip or 
Extract button (depending on what it is called).
 
3.  Wait for the self-extraction process to end. 
Depending on the size of the driver, the extraction can take a while to complete. 
Once inished, you should see the irst driver installation window.

 
Installing Drivers for a Shared Network Printer in Windows XP   297
Tip  Some self-extractors for printer drivers do not automatically start the irst installation

Installing Drivers for a Shared Network Printer  
in Windows Vista
Installing a network printer is a process that varies greatly depending on the manu-
facturer of the printer. If you are using Windows Vista and the printer is connected to 
another computer and shared with the network, you need to irst install the Windows 
Vista drivers for that printer. Some drivers allow the detection of network printers, and 
when you installed them, everything was set up for you in one pass. Other drivers do not. 
If the driver does not allow the detection of shared network printers, then you need to 
irst install the driver and then manually add the printer using the Add a Printer Wizard.
To further complicate things, the setup of a printer driver is different, based on the 
manufacturer and the model. Also, the number of steps is almost never the same. How-
ever, the basic principles apply to all setup programs provided by the different printer 
manufacturers.
In this exercise, you will learn how to install the drivers for a printer in Windows Vista 
using the setup program provided by the manufacturer of the printer. For the purposes 
of this exercise, we will set up an HP Photosmart C5280 printer.
SET UP Write down the manufacturer and the exact model of the shared network 
printer.
 
1.  Download the Windows Vista driver from the Web site of the company that manu-
factured your printer. 
Printer drivers are typically provided as a self-extracting archive ile and include the 
“.exe” extension in their ile name.

 
Installing Drivers for a Shared Network Printer in Windows Vista   325
 
2.  Run the printer driver setup ile. If you receive a UAC prompt, click Continue.
The self-extraction process starts. Usually, the driver setup displays a progress 
window.
Tip   Some drivers ask you to choose where you want the extracted iles to be placed. 
Others simply start the self-extraction process without asking. If you are asked for a 
location, select the folder where you want the driver to reside, then click the Unzip or 
Extract button (depending on what it is called).
 
3.  Wait for the self-extraction process to end.
Depending on the size of the driver, the extraction can take a while to complete. 
Once inished, you should see the irst driver installation window.

326  Chapter 10 Sharing Between Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 Computers
Tip  Some self-extractors for printer drivers do not automatically start the irst installation 
window. In such a case, you need to manually start it yourself. Go to the folder where the 
driver was extracted and run the setup.exe ile.
 
4.  Click Install.
After a few seconds, the installation wizard displays some information about the 
process that is about to start and what you need to pay attention to.
Tip   This screen (or one similar to it) is shown mostly by HP printer drivers but not by 
other manufacturers. Some manufacturers prefer to start the installation immediately, 
with fewer preliminary windows for you to read.

 
Installing Drivers for a Shared Network Printer in Windows Vista   327
 
5.  Click Next.
You are asked if you want to perform an Easy Install or an Advanced Install.
 
6.  Easy installs work only if the printer is connected to your computer. In this case, it 
is not, so choose Advanced Install, then click Next. In addition, using Advanced 
Install is often a better choice because Easy Install usually installs additional soft-
ware you don’t need, such as toolbars, trial versions to products you will never use, 
and so on.
You are asked if you want HP to check for software updates automatically.

328  Chapter 10 Sharing Between Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 Computers
 
7.  Choose the option you prefer, then click Next.
You are asked if you want the setup to install all the software needed for your 
printer as well as additional elements recommended by HP, or if you want to 
make a custom installation of software.

the installation process has ended.
 
14.  Click Finish.
The printer drivers are now installed. However, the installation process is not yet 
done. Be patient for a couple of moments and read the following section to learn 
how to inish up.
Tip  Other manufacturers offer setup programs for their drivers that allow you to select a shared 
network printer in addition to a local one. When using such drivers, it is enough to select the 
shared network printer and continue the installation. When you have inished, everything works 
and there’s no need to follow the instructions in the next section.

Sharing folders from Mac OS X with Windows 7 computers has never been easier. Thanks 
to OS X’s built-in support for the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol, allow-
ing read and write access to Windows 7 computers can be done with just a few tweaks 
in the Mac’s System Preferences. The SMB Protocol is designed to provide easy network 
sharing capabilities so that people can access iles, folders, printers, and other devices 
over the nodes of a network.
In this chapter, you will irst learn how to set up Mac OS X so that you can share folders 
with your Windows 7 computers. Then, you will learn how to access these shared 
folders and how to access a Windows 7 shared printer from Mac OS X so that you can 
print the iles you need.

338  Chapter 11 Sharing Between Mac OS X and Windows 7 Computers
Practice Files You can use any of your iles and folders on your Mac and Windows 7 
computer to complete the exercises in this chapter. Until you get the hang of it, it is best 
not to use any important iles. Also, back up the iles and folders you are about to use, 
just to make sure you don’t lose them by mistake.
Setting the Workgroup on Your OS X Computer
In order to share iles and folders between computers running different operating systems—
and without too much hassle—it is best to set the same workgroup on all of them. By 
default, the workgroup set on Mac OS X is named “Workgroup”, which is the same as in 
Windows 7 and many other operating systems. However, there may be cases when it is 
set differently for various reasons, or you just need to change it to another name.
In this exercise, you will learn how to change the workgroup on your Mac OS X computer.

10.  Select the permission level you desire for that user: Read & Write, Read Only, 
Write Only (Drop Box), or No Access.
Tip  For convenience, assign Read and/or Write permissions to the Everyone user. By 
doing this, Windows 7 users won’t need to type a user name and password to connect 
to the Mac shared folder. However, this means that everybody on your home network 
has access to your shared folder. If you don’t want this, it is safer to allow access only to 
certain users.
 
11.  When done adding shared folders and setting permissions, close the Sharing 
window.
Tip  You can add multiple folders, each with different read and write permissions. This is 
useful, for example, if you’d like to set up a Write Only drop box (where multiple users 
can turn in assignments or documents into a single folder but other users cannot read 
them) or a Read Only folder for reference.
You are now sharing the selected iles with the other computers on your network.
CLEAN UP Close System Preferences. If you want to access the shared folders from 
your Windows computers, remain logged on with one of the user accounts for which 
you enabled those shared folders.

 
Accessing OS X Shared Folders from Windows 7 Computers  347
Accessing OS X Shared Folders from Windows 7 
Computers
Once you’ve completed setting up your Mac, your Windows 7 computers should be able 
to access the shared folders under Network In Windows Explorer. If you have allowed 
read/write access for everyone, or if your credentials for your Macintosh are the same as 
for your Windows 7 (for instance, exact same user name and password), there shouldn’t 
be any extra steps involved. You just need to be logged on under the user account you 
conigured for ile sharing on your Macintosh. If your Mac doesn’t show up immediately, 
wait for a few seconds, and then click the refresh button.
Troubleshooting  If you have trouble getting the Mac to show up under Network in Windows 
Explorer, it is recommended to create a network drive. In most cases, this helps your Windows 7 
computer to ind your Mac shared folders the next time you access them. The instructions on 
how to map a network drive are found in the ”Mapping Network Drives” section in Chapter 7, 
“Sharing Libraries and Folders.”

348  Chapter 11 Sharing Between Mac OS X and Windows 7 Computers
Setting Up Windows 7 to Share with OS X
In order to access Windows 7 shared folders from your Mac OS X computer, you irst 
need to set the network location in Windows 7 to Home Network. 
See Also  For more information on network locations and how to set them, see the “Setting the 
Network Location” section in Chapter 4, “Creating the Network.”
Also, you need to make sure that the workgroup is set the same for both Mac OS X and 
Windows 7 computers.
See Also  For information on how to change the Workgroup on Windows 7 computers, see the 
“Setting the Workgroup” section in Chapter 4.
If these settings are made, your Mac OS X should be able to easily access Windows 7 
shared folders on your home network.
Accessing Windows 7 Shared Folders from  
OS X Computers
Once you’ve completed setting up your Windows 7 computer, your Mac OS X computers 
should pick up the shared folders. In order to access them, you need to use the Connect 
To Server functionality.

Automatically Mount Your Windows 7 Shared 
Folders on OS X
If you want to forgo the entire process of mounting your Windows 7 shared folder each 
time you reboot, one great trick is to add it to the login items on OS X. This saves you the 
trouble of having to mount it each time you want to connect to it.
In this exercise, you will learn how to set your Mac OS X computer to automatically 
mount your Windows 7 computer upon login.

Accessing a Windows 7 Shared Printer from OS X
Snow Leopard OS X 10.6 features a Windows tab in its Add A Printer dialog box. There’s 
only one problem: It doesn’t work very well, at least not for shared printers connected 
to Windows 7. Fortunately, you can still print to a shared Windows 7 printer from a 
Mac OS X computer by using a moderately simple workaround. The trick is to use the 
Line Printer Daemon/Line Printer Remote (LPD/LPR) protocol.

 
Accessing a Windows 7 Shared Printer from OS X  355
Enabling the Correct Printing Services in Windows 7
Before you can install a Windows 7 shared printer, you need to enable a few addi-
tional printing services. Otherwise, you’ll have problems and won’t be able to 
access the printer. 
In this exercise, you will learn how enable the required Windows 7 printing services so 
that you can install your Windows 7 shared printer from Mac OS X.
SET UP Install the printer on your Windows 7 computer and ensure that it prints 
correctly.
 
1.  Type windows features in the Start menu search box.
A list of search results displays.
 
2.  Click the Turn Windows features on or off search result.

9.  In the Type ield, choose LPD/LPR Host or Printer.
 
10.  Leave the Device ield set to Another Device.
 
11.  In the URL ield, type lpd://HOSTIPADDRESS/SHARENAME, replacing your 
Windows 7 computer’s IP address for HOSTIPADDRESS and the share name of your 
printer for SHARENAME.
 
12.  Enter anything you’d like for the Name ield.
This can be different from the actual share name of your printer. Make it something 
descriptive, such as Shared HP C4700 on Win7.
 
13.  Leave the Location ield blank.
 
14.  In the Print Using ield, select a printer.
Important  Selecting a printer is tricky. It may require some trial and error to get the 
best results. Ideally, you should choose the driver speciic to your printer, but not all 
manufacturer printer drivers support LPD/LPR network printing. If the manufacturer’s 
driver doesn’t work, try a Gutenprint version for your model, if it exists. (Gutenprint 
comes pre-installed with OS X 10.6. You can also download Gutenprint drivers from 
www.sourceforge.net.) If those both fail, try the Generic PostScript Printer driver. The 
Generic PostScript Printer driver (or one of the other generic Apple drivers) works for 
most printers, but for some, it causes erratic behavior—for example, printing 10 blank 
pages for no reason.
 
15.  Click Add when you have inished.
You might be asked to set printer options.
 
16.  Conigure the printer and click Continue.
CLEAN UP Close the Print & Fax window, and then close System Preferences.

 
Key Points  361
The Windows 7 shared printer is now installed and you can start using it from any appli-
cation. It will appear just like a local printer when you bring up the Print dialog. When 
you click Print, the document should be printed from the Windows 7 shared printer.
This workaround is one of the easiest ways to print to a Windows 7 shared printer from a 
Mac OS X computer, and pending a perfect solution from either Apple or Microsoft, it’s 
likely the best way to share a printer between a Mac OS X and Windows 7 computer.
Key Points
 
●To share iles and folders between Mac OS X and Windows 7 with less hassle, make

4 Set the Workgroup to match other computers on your home network.
4 Share folders.
4 Access Ubuntu Linux shared folders from Windows 7.
4 Access Windows 7 shared folders.
4 Access a Windows 7 shared printer.
4 Mount a Windows 7 shared partition or folder.
Sharing iles, folders, and printers between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 computers is 
a reasonably simple procedure. And even though you are required to install a special 
Ubuntu service to make things work, it is not dificult, and with a bit of attention, all  
settings can be conigured correctly in one go.
In this chapter, you will irst learn how to set up Ubuntu Linux so that you can share 
folders with your Windows 7 computers. Then, you will learn how to access these shared 
folders and how to access a Windows 7 shared printer from Ubuntu Linux so you can 
print the iles you need. At the end of the chapter, you will learn how to mount a Win-
dows 7 shared folder or partition in Ubuntu Linux to provide easy access.
Practice Files You won’t need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this chapter. 
Until you get the hang of it, it is best not to use any important iles. Also, back up the 
iles and folders you are about to use, just to make sure you don’t lose them by mistake.

364  Chapter 12 Sharing Between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers
Installing the Sharing Service in Ubuntu Linux
Before you can start exchanging iles and folders between a computer running Ubuntu 
Linux and computers running other operating systems, you need to install the sharing 
service. The service is not a part of a default installation of Ubuntu Linux, and it can be 
installed using several methods, some more complex than others.
In this exercise, you will learn how to install the sharing service in Ubuntu Linux using the 
most visual and easy-to-follow procedure.
SET UP Open the Home Folder, which is located in the Places menu.
 
1.  By default, the user account you are logged on with is selected. A list with the 
folders you own is opened. Right-click any folder from this list.
This opens a contextual list of possible actions.

2.  Click Sharing Options.
The Folder Sharing window opens.
 
3.  Select the check box beside Share this folder.
Immediately, Ubuntu Linux displays a warning window, stating that the sharing 
service is not installed.
Important  If you do not receive this warning, it means the sharing service is already 
installed. In such a scenario, close the Folder Sharing window and ignore all the other 
steps described in this exercise.
 
4.  Click Install service.
You are asked to enter your password.

7.  Save any open iles you might have, then click Restart session.
After the restart, the sharing service is installed and fully functioning.
CLEAN UP The folder you tried to share at the start of this exercise was not shared. 
To start sharing iles and folders, follow the instructions detailed in the “Sharing 
Folders in Ubuntu Linux” section on page 369.
Setting the Workgroup on Your Ubuntu 
Linux Computer
In order to share iles and folders between computers running different operating sys-
tems—and without too much hassle—it is best to set the same workgroup on all of them. 
By default, the workgroup set on Ubuntu Linux is named “Workgroup,” which is the same 
as in Windows 7, Mac OS X, and many other operating systems. However, there may be 
times when it is set differently, or you just need to change it to another name. 
Important  Keep in mind that you cannot change the workgroup if you have not irst enabled 
the sharing service in Ubuntu Linux. To learn how to enable it, see the previous section, 
“Installing the Sharing Service in Ubuntu Linux,” on page 364.
In this exercise, you will learn how to change the workgroup on your Ubuntu Linux.
SET UP On the computer running Ubuntu Linux, open the Terminal.
 
1.  In the Terminal window, type sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf and press Enter.
Ubuntu requests that you enter your user account password.
Note  If you have used the Terminal prior to this exercise, you won’t be requested to enter 
your user account password.

368  Chapter 12 Sharing Between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers
 
2.  Type your user account password and press Enter.
This opens the Samba coniguration ile in a gedit window.
 
3.  Find the workgroup setting in the Global Settings section of the coniguration ile.
 
4.  Change the value of the workgroup ield to match the name of the workgroup that 
you want your Ubuntu Linux to join.
 
5.  Click Save.
CLEAN UP Save any open iles, then restart your Ubuntu Linux computer.
After the restart, Ubuntu Linux joins the speciied workgroup.

 
Sharing Folders in Ubuntu Linux  369
Sharing Folders in Ubuntu Linux
Once you have enabled the sharing service and set up the workgroup to be the same on 
all your home computers, you can successfully start sharing iles, folders, or printers.
In this exercise, you will learn how to share folders in Ubuntu Linux with the computers 
on your home network.
SET UP Open the Home Folder, which is located in the Places menu.
 
1.  Right-click any folder.
This opens a contextual list of possible actions.

370  Chapter 12 Sharing Between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers
 
2.  Click Sharing Options.
The Folder Sharing window opens.
 
3.  Select the check box beside Share this folder.
 
4.  In the Share name ield, type the name you want to use for the shared folder.
 
5.  In the Comment ield, type any comments you might have. If you don’t have any, 
there is no problem in leaving this ield empty.
 
6.  If you want to allow people who are accessing this folder to be able to add and 
remove iles or folders within it, select the Allow others to create and delete iles 
in this folder check box.
 
7.  If you want to allow everyone to access this folder, including people without a 
user account deined on the Ubuntu Linux computer, select the Guest access (for 
people without a user account) check box. If this option is not selected, each time 
someone tries to access the shared folder, that person will be required to type a 
user account and password deined on the Ubuntu Linux computer.
 
8.  When you have inished coniguring all the settings, click Create Share.
If you selected the Allow others to create and delete iles in this folder, option, 
you will receive a prompt alerting you that Nautilus needs to add some permissions 
to your folder in order to share it.

 
Sharing Folders in Ubuntu Linux  371
 
9.  Click Add the permissions automatically.
The folder is now shared with the network, based on the settings you speciied.
CLEAN UP Repeat the procedure for any other folders you want to share with the 
other computers on your home network.
Important  This procedure for sharing folders works only if you are sharing folders found in 
the Home folder. If you try to use this procedure to share folders found in other locations, such 
as system locations, it will not work, and you will receive the following error message: “net 
usershare returned error 255: net usershare add: cannot share path as we are restricted to only 
sharing directories we own.” To share folders other than the ones your user account owns, you 
need to go through a rather complicated procedure that involves editing coniguration iles. 
Also, doing this adds security risks. The security recommendation is to share only folders that 
your user account owns.

372  Chapter 12 Sharing Between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers
Accessing Ubuntu Shared Folders from

380  Chapter 12 Sharing Between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers
 
4.  Click Properties.
The Printer Properties window opens for the selected printer.
 
5.  Look at the Make and Model ield. If it’s listed as Local Raw Printer, it means that 
the appropriate printer driver is not installed. If the printer’s actual make and model 
information is displayed, then the driver is already present and you can ignore the 
following steps. The network printer will work on your Ubuntu Linux computer.
 
6.  Click the Change button found on the right side of the Make and Model ield.
The Change Driver window opens.

 
Accessing a Windows 7 Shared Printer from Ubuntu Computers   381

drivers.

382  Chapter 12 Sharing Between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers
 
9.  Find the correct model of printer and select it. For this example it is Photosmart 
c5200.
In the drivers section, you will see another list with available drivers.
 
10.  If you are presented with more than one version of a driver, select the one with 
“cups” in the name. CUPS stands for Common Unix Printing System, and these  
drivers generally tend to work better.
 
11.  Click Forward.
You are asked if you want to transfer the current settings.

 
Accessing a Windows 7 Shared Printer from Ubuntu Computers   383
 
12.  Because the printer is not yet installed, there are no true settings to transfer. 
Therefore, select Use the new PPD (Postscript Printer Descriptions) as is.
 
13.  Click the Forward button.
You are now asked about additional options to enable or conigure. The list 
depends on the printer model. For our HP Photosmart c5200 model, we are only 
allowed to install the Duplexer. The Duplexer is a feature which allows printing on 
both sides of the paper.

384  Chapter 12 Sharing Between Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7 Computers
 
14.  Install and conigure the options you desire. When you have inished, click Apply.
You are taken back to the Printer Properties window. 
Tip  If you look at the Make and Model ield, you can see that now it has the name of 
the printer you just installed. If you have a different result, close the Printer Properties 
window and start again, carefully following the steps described in this exercise.
 
15.  To test the printer, click the Print Test Page button.
You are informed that the test page was submitted.
 
16.  Click OK.
If a test page prints, your setup is correct. You can now use the network printer 
from Ubuntu Linux.

Mounting Windows 7 Shared Partitionsand Folders in Ubuntu   385
Mounting Windows 7 Shared Partitions 
and Folders in Ubuntu
If you want to have even easier access to Windows 7 shared partitions and folders, it can 
be a good idea to have them mounted permanently each time you log on to Ubuntu 
Linux. The procedure you need to follow for mounting them is slightly more complex. 
However, once done, you will save time accessing shared partitions and folders, and you 
will ind it much more convenient to do so.
In this exercise, you will learn how to mount a Windows 7 shared partition or folder in 
Ubuntu Linux.
SET UP Open the Terminal.
 
1.  In the Terminal window, type sudo mkdir /media/mountname and press Enter.
Replace mountname with the name you want to give the folder you want to 
mount. In our example, we wanted to call it music; therefore, we typed sudo mkdir 
/media/music.
Ubuntu will request that you enter your user account password.
 
2.  Type your user account password, then press Enter.
 
3.  Type sudo gedit /etc/fstab, then press Enter.
This opens the fstab ile in a gedit window.

4.  Go to the end of the ile and type the following line: //servername/sharename  /
media/mountname  cifs  username=myusername,password=mypassword  0  0. 
Replace the following ields:
 
●servername Type the name of the Windows 7 computer sharing the folder 
or partition you want to mount. In our example, it is george-pc.
 
●sharename Supply the name of the shared folder or partition as it is on 
the Windows 7 system. In our example, it is named music.
 
●mountname Provide the name of the folder you just created in step 1. 
The names must be the same. In our example, it is named music.
 
●myusername This is the name of the user account deined on the Win-
dows 7 computer. This user account must have access permissions to the 
shared folder or partition. In our example, it is named george.
 
●mypassword Type the password of the user account deined on the 
Windows 7 computer. In our example, it is pass.
In our example, the whole line looks like this: //george-pc/music  /media/
music  cifs  username=george,password=pass  0  0.

 
Mounting Windows 7 Shared Partitionsand Folders in Ubuntu   387
Important  Make sure you don’t type any spaces between the username, the comma 
following it, and the password. The setup won’t work if you don’t insert the proper 
number of spaces in the correct locations.
 
5.  When you have inished, click Save.
 
6.  Close the gedit window.
You are now back to the Terminal window.
 
7.  Type sudo mount –a, and then press Enter.
This causes the mounted folder or partition to appear on your Ubuntu desktop, 
with the name equal to the sharename ield you entered in step 6.
The Windows 7 shared folder or partition is now mounted each time you log on to your 
Ubuntu Linux computer.
Tip  To remove the mounted folder or partition, open the Terminal and follow step 3. Remove 
the line you added in step 4. Then, follow steps 5 and 6, and skip step 7. The next time you 
reboot your Ubuntu Linux computer, the folder or partition will no longer be mounted.

If you arrived at this stage, your home network is fully conigured. You are able to con-
nect to the other computers on your network and share iles, folders, and devices. You 
can also stream your media over the network and the Internet. Simply put, you can inally 
take full advantage of the capabilities that your home network offers.
In order for everything to keep working at optimal levels, it’s time for you to learn how 
to keep your network secure. This means a mix of enabling and using the right security 
tools that Windows 7 has to offer in addition to the installation of third-party security 
products.
In this chapter, you will irst learn how to take advantage of important security tools 
provided by Windows 7: the User Account Control (UAC), Windows Update, Windows 
Defender, Windows Firewall, and the Action Center. You will also learn how to protect 
your computers from viruses. We will show you where to ind the best security solutions 
available on the market via some great Internet Web sites, which are updated on a regu-
lar basis with the latest security tools and performance patches.
Practice Files You won’t need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this chapter.
Understanding User Account Control
When Windows Vista was launched, User Account Control (UAC) was the most criticized 
and misunderstood feature. Even though it was very important for security, many people 
chose to disable it, subsequently exposing their systems to potential security risks. Many 
problems could have been avoided if people understood the beneits offered by UAC. In 
response to that criticism, Windows 7 brings further changes to what is in reality a very 
good feature.
In order to avoid further misunderstanding and to prevent people from exposing their 
computers to security risks, this section will explain UAC in detail and present the reasons 
why you should always keep it turned on.

 
How UAC Works  393
What Is UAC?
UAC is a security feature of Windows Vista and Windows 7 that helps prevent unauthor-
ized changes to your computer. These changes can be initiated by users, applications, 
viruses, or other types of malware. UAC makes sure these changes are made only with 
the approval of the administrator of the computer. If the administrator does not approve 
these changes, they will never be executed, and the system will remain unchanged.
How UAC Works
Unlike Windows XP, in Windows Vista and Windows 7, applications run by default 
without any administrative permissions. As a result, they cannot make any changes to 
the operating system. When an application wants to make system changes, such as 
modiications that affect other user accounts, modiications of system iles and folders, or 
installation of new software, UAC prompts the user to ask for permission.
If the user clicks No, the change won’t be performed. If the user clicks Yes, the applica-
tion receives administrative permissions and is able to make the system changes it is 
programmed to do. These permissions will be in force until the application stops running 
or the user closes it. The next time the application runs, it starts again without adminis-
trative permissions.

394  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
For an easier understanding, the UAC algorithm is explained in the following diagram.
Changes Requiring Administrative Privileges
There are many changes that require administrative privileges, and depending on how 
UAC is conigured on your computer, they can cause a UAC prompt to pop up and ask 
for permissions. Changes requiring administrative permission are as follows:
 
●Running an application as an administrator.
 
●Changing system-wide settings or to iles in the Windows and Program Files folders.
 
●Installing and uninstalling drivers and applications.
 
●Installing ActiveX controls.
 
●Changing settings to the Windows Firewall.
 
●Changing UAC settings.
 
●Coniguring Windows Update.
 
●Adding or removing user accounts.
 
●Changing a user’s account type.
 
●Coniguring Parental Controls.

 
The Differences Between UAC Levels  395
 
●Running Task Scheduler.
 
●Restoring backed-up system iles.
 
●Viewing or changing the folders and iles of another user account.
 
●Changing the system date and time.
Having UAC turned off means any user and any application can make any of these changes 
without a prompt for permissions. This would allow viruses and other forms of malware 
to infect and take control of your system much easier than when UAC is turned on.
The Differences Between UAC Levels
Unlike Windows Vista, where you had only two options—UAC turned on or off—in Windows 
7, there are four levels from which to choose. The differences between the levels are as 
follows:
 
●Always notify At this level, you are notiied before applications make changes that 
require administrative permissions or before you or another user change Windows 7 
settings. When a UAC prompt appears, your desktop is dimmed and you must 
choose Yes or No before you can continue to do anything else on your computer. 
Security Impact: This is the most secure setting but also the most annoying. If you 
do not like the UAC implementation from Windows Vista, you won’t like this level 
either.
 
●Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer This is the 
default level; it notiies you only before programs make changes to your computer 
that require administrative permissions. If you manually make changes to Windows 
7, you are not notiied by UAC. This level is less annoying because it doesn’t stop 
the user when making changes to the system; it only shows prompts if an applica-
tion wants to make changes. When a UAC prompt appears, the desktop is dimmed 
and you must choose Yes or No before you can continue to do anything else 
on your computer. Security Impact: This is less secure because some malicious 
programs can simulate the keystrokes or mouse moves of a user. These programs 
can change Windows 7 settings. However, if you are using a good security solution, 
these scenarios should never occur.
 
●Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer (do not dim 
my desktop) This level is identical to the previous level, except when a UAC 
prompt appears, the desktop is not dimmed and other programs might be able 
to interfere with the UAC dialog window. Security Impact: This level is even less 
secure because it is easier for malicious programs to simulate keystrokes or mouse 

396  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
moves that interfere with the UAC prompt. Again, a very good security solution can 
compensate for the slight decrease in security.
 
●Never notify At this level, UAC is turned off and doesn’t offer any protection 
against unauthorized system changes. Any user or application can make system 
changes without any prompts for permission. Security Impact: If you don’t have 
a good security solution, you are very likely to have security problems when using 
this level. With UAC turned off, it is easier for malicious programs to infect your 
computer and take control of it and/or its settings. 
Recommendation  Use either of the irst two levels. The third level can be used as well when 
you have a very good security solution in place. The fourth level should always be avoided 
because it negatively impacts the security of your system.
Coniguring UAC
Now that you know what this feature does and how it works, it’s time to show you how 
to conigure the level of security you desire. In this exercise, you will learn how.
SET UP Open the Control Panel.
 
1.   Click System and Security.
The System And Security window opens.

 
Coniguring UAC  397
 
2.  In the Action Center section, click the Change User Account Control settings 
link. 
The User Account Control Settings window opens, which shows the current level set 
for UAC.
 
3.  Move the slide to the UAC level you want to use on your computer. 
Important  Before changing the UAC level, don’t forget to review the previous section, 
“The Differences Between UAC Levels.” It is very important to irst understand the 
differences between each level before making any changes.
 
4.  Click the OK button.
 
5.  Depending on what level UAC was set before making the change, you might 
receive a UAC prompt. Click Yes if you do.
CLEAN UP Close the System and Security window.
The UAC is set to the level you selected and will provide you with the corresponding level 
of security, depending on the choice you made.

398  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Should I Disable UAC When I Install My Applications and 
Turn It On Afterward?
The biggest annoyance caused by UAC is when you install applications. During 
installation, you can receive a lot of UAC prompts (depending on how many appli-
cations you install). You might be tempted to disable it temporarily while you install 
all your applications and then enable it again when you’re done. In some scenarios, 
this is a bad idea. Certain applications make lots of system changes and can fail 
to work if you turn on UAC after their installation, even though they work when 
you install them with UAC turned on. This is because when UAC is turned off, the 
virtualization techniques used by UAC for all applications are inactive. This causes 
certain user settings and iles to be installed to a different place, so they no longer 
work when UAC is turned back on. To avoid these problems, it is better to have UAC 
turned on at all times.
Keeping Your System Up to Date
Keeping your system up-to-date is very important for keeping it as secure as possible. 
Viruses and other forms of malware that exploit security problems in Windows 7 and 
other operating systems appear on a daily basis. Being up-to-date means having fewer 
security issues and fewer chances of your computer becoming infected and exploited by 
unauthorized parties. Therefore, you should have Windows Update turned on at all times 
and conigured to automatically install the most important updates.
Windows Update is one of the tools that were redesigned completely in Windows Vista. 
Instead of having to browse to a speciic Microsoft Web page (as with Windows XP), the 
entire update process was managed directly by the operating system. Windows 7 keeps 
the same approach as Windows Vista but introduces a small number of changes to this 
process—mostly cosmetic.
This section will cover the important bits you need to know about this tool so that 
you keep your computer up-to-date with latest security and performance patches and 
updates for Windows 7.

 
Opening Windows Update  399
Opening Windows Update
You can open the Windows Update tool using several methods. In this exercise, you will 
learn how to open Windows Update using two of the existing methods. 
SET UP Open the Control Panel.
 
1.   Click System and Security.
The System And Security window opens.
 
2.  Scroll down and click the Windows Update section.
The Windows Update window opens, which gives you a quick overview on how 
up-to-date your operating system is and how many updates are available.

400  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Tip  Another way to open this tool is to go to Start Menu -> All Programs -> Windows Update.
You can now access all the coniguration settings available in Windows Update and use 
the tool to check for updates, install available updates, view your update history, or 
restore hidden updates.
CLEAN UP Close the Windows Update window when done working with it.
Coniguring Windows Update Settings
Windows Update has a pretty good set of default settings. Without the need for you to 
intervene, this tool is turned on, regularly checks for updates, and automatically installs 
the important ones on your computer. This helps to keep your operating system as up to 
date and secure as possible with the most relevant updates.
Even so, it is a good idea to check these settings, understand them, and conigure them 
to better meet your speciic needs.
In this exercise, you will learn how to conigure your Windows Update settings so that 
the tool behaves as you want it to.

 
Coniguring Windows Update Settings  401
SET UP Log on as administrator and open Windows Update.
 
1.   In the left column, click Change settings.
The Change settings window opens, which contains all the settings that you can 
conigure for the Windows Update tool.
 
2.  Go to the Important updates section. Here you can set how important updates are 
installed on your computer:
 
●Install updates automatically (recommended) This sets Windows Update to 
automatically install important updates as they are available. It is also the 
most recommended option because it allows you to keep your computer as 
up to date as possible without any intervention on your part.

402  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
●Download updates but let me choose whether to install them This option 
allows Windows Update to automatically download the important updates. 
Once this is done, you are notiied and can choose whether to install them. 
This option is recommended for those who want more control over the 
update process.
 
●Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install 
them This option instructs Windows Update to notify you before performing 
any downloads and installations. When a new update is detected, you are 
prompted to choose what you want to do next.
 
●Never check for updates (not recommended) This option disables any auto-
matic update check functionality. It is highly risky because your computer will 
be updated only if you make manual checks for updates. It is recommended 
not to use this option, unless you have a regular habit of manually checking 
for updates.
 
3.  Choose the option that best its your needs. 
 
4.  If you select Install updates automatically (recommended), you can also set 
when the new updates are installed. You can select a speciic day of the week, every 
day, or even the hour when installations should occur. 
Tip  To be as up to date as possible, it is best to select Every Day, then specify an hour 
when your computer is generally turned on.
 
5.  If you want recommended updates to be treated like important updates, select the 
Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates 
check box.

 
Coniguring Windows Update Settings  403
 
6.  If you want to allow all users to install updates on your computer, select the Allow 
all users to install updates on this computer check box. Otherwise, leave it 
cleared.
Recommendation  It is best to always select this option because it helps ensure that your 
computer is up to date at any time, independent of the user accounts using it.
 
7.  Windows Update allows you to check for updates to other Microsoft products, such 
as Microsoft Ofice, Windows Live Essentials, Silverlight, and so on. To receive them, 
select the Give me updates for Microsoft products and check for new optional 
Microsoft software when I update Windows check box. Otherwise, leave it 
cleared.
 
8.  If Windows Update is set to check for new optional Microsoft software, you can 
set it to show you detailed notiications about the update. To enable this behavior, 
select the Show me detailed notiications when new Microsoft software is 
available check box. Otherwise, leave it cleared.
 
9.  When you’re inished coniguring all the settings, click OK.
Note  Depending on the model of your computer and where you bought it, you can have 
additional coniguration options that were added by the manufacturer. To learn about the 
additional options, check the documentation provided with your computer.
Windows Update is now conigured to work according to your needs.
CLEAN UP Close the Windows Update window.

404  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Checking for and Installing Updates Manually
Be default, Windows Update automatically checks for Windows 7 updates each time you 
log on, and it installs the updates according to the way it is conigured to act. However, 
you can also perform manual checks and installations of updates.
In this exercise, you will learn how to manually check for updates and how to install them 
on your Windows 7 computer.
SET UP Open Windows Update.
 
1.   In the left column, click Check for updates.
Windows Update starts checking for the latest available Windows updates.
 
2.  After a while, a summary of the indings appears. If there are updates available, 
they are separated into two categories: important updates and optional updates.

 
Checking for and Installing Updates Manually  405
Important  Do not click the Install Updates button yet. Follow the steps recommended 
below.
 
3.  Click the updates summary to review the list of available updates.
This opens the list of available updates, separated by category:
 
●Important updates are those that ix security, stability, and compatibility 
problems in Windows 7. They can also add functionality. One good example 
is Service Packs. They are labeled as important because they help maintain 
your security and keep your performance up to date. Within this section is a 
subsection called Recommended Updates. These updates can ix stability and 
compatibility problems for applications that are installed on your computer, 
such as compatibility ixes for Windows Media Center or Internet Explorer, 
Deinition Updates for Windows Defender or Microsoft Security Essentials, and 
updates for Microsoft Ofice.
 
●Optional updates are extras that consist of language packs, additional soft-
ware, or drivers for your computer’s components. Most of these updates can 
be skipped unless they provide some speciic functionality or drivers that you 
need.

406  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
4.  Click each update to learn more about it.
A description of the update will appear that gives you information about what it 
does and when it was published. You are also notiied if it will require a restart of 
your computer after it is installed.
 
5.  Select the updates you want to install on your computer by selecting the check 
boxes beside their names.
 
6.  For updates that you do not want installed, clear the check boxes beside their 
names.
 
7.  When you have inished, click OK.
Windows Update starts to download and install the selected updates.

 
Checking for and Installing Updates Manually  407
Note  If for any reason you want to cancel the download process, you can always press 
the Stop Download button.
 
8.  When done, Windows Update informs you that the updates were successfully 
installed.
 
9.  If the Restart now button is displayed, it means you need to restart your computer 
in order for the updates to be applied. Close any applications and documents you 
have open, then click Restart now.

408  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Tip  You can use your computer without restarting it. If you want to do so, simply do not click 
the Restart Now button. The update process will inish the next time you restart your computer.
Your computer is now updated and secure.
CLEAN UP If you did not need to restart your computer, close the Windows Update 
window.
Postponing Restarts Required by Windows Updates
Some of the updates automatically installed by Windows Update require a restart in 
order for them to be applied to the operating system. In such cases, you receive a 
notiication to restart your computer.
If you want to restart when you receive the notiication, irst save any work you 
have in progress, close all your applications, then click Restart Now. This restarts 
your computer and inalizes the update installation process.
If you do not wish to restart, go to the Remind me in drop-down menu, select 
when you want to be reminded again, and then click Postpone. You will be notiied 
again when the selected time is up, and you will be able to choose the most conve-
nient option again.
Hiding or Preventing Updates from Installing
There are scenarios for which you might not want a certain update to be installed 
on your computer. A scenario that we have encountered on several occasions 
is Windows 7 proposing an update for an outdated or bad driver for one of the 
computer’s components. This happens especially when it comes to video cards. If 
you download the latest driver for your video card directly from the Web site of 

 
Checking for and Installing Updates Manually  409
its manufacturer (AMD, ATI, Intel, NVIDIA, and so on), you will notice that the one 
proposed by Windows Update is, most of the time, an older version.
Another scenario is when you do not require the functionality added by an update, 
such as Microsoft’s browser ballot, which was imposed by the European Union. You 
might not need to install this update because you might have already installed the 
browsers you need.
To avoid these issues, it is better to review the available updates before installing 
them. Therefore, check for updates, but also check the available updates and what 
they offer. When you click an update, Windows Update presents some information 
about what it does. If you don’t want the update, right-click it, and then select Hide 
Update.
The upgrade is dimmed and it will not be installed or shown by future update 
checks.

410  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Restoring Hidden Updates
Once you hide an update, it is not installed on your computer and is never shown in 
future update checks. If you want to restore it and make it available again, you need to 
go through a series of steps.
In this exercise, you will learn how to restore the updates that you have previously 
hidden.
SET UP Open Windows Update.
 
1.   In the left column, click Restore hidden updates.
The Restore Hidden Updates window opens.
 
2.  To view information about an update, right-click it, then choose View details.
This opens a Windows Update window that shows information about the update.

 
Restoring Hidden Updates  411
 
3.  When you’re done reading the information, click Close.
 
4.  Read the information available about the hidden updates until you ind the one(s) 
that you want to restore.
 
5.  Select the check box beside the name of the update you want to restore. 
Note  If you want to restore more than one update, select the corresponding check boxes 
for each of them.
 
6.  Click Restore.
Windows Update checks again for available updates and shows you a quick report.

412  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
The restored update is now available for installation. 
See Also  To learn how to manually check for updates and how to install them, see the “Check-
ing for and Installing Updates Manually” section on page 404.
CLEAN UP Close the Windows Update window.
Reviewing Your Windows Update History
Windows Update stores a complete log of its activities. This log contains information 
such as which updates were installed and when, the status of the installation process, and 
the importance of each update. There are times when you might be interested to know 
such details. Luckily, making this check is very easy.

 
Reviewing Your Windows Update History  413
In this exercise, you will learn how to review your Windows Update history and view 
complete information about the updates installed on your computer.
SET UP Open Windows Update.
 
1.   In the left column, click View update history.
The View Update History window opens.
 
2.  To easily ind more of the updates you’re interested in, it is best to use the column 
sort option. 
For example, if you click the Name column, it will sort all updates by name, in 
ascending order. If you click it again, it will sort them in descending order. You can 
do the same with the other columns (Status, Importance, and Date Installed).
 
3.  Right-click the update you are interested in knowing more about.
This opens a contextual menu that contains two options: View Details and Copy 
Details.

414  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
4.  Select View details if you want to learn more about that speciic update.
This opens a window containing complete details about the update, such as instal-
lation date and time, installation status, the type of update, what the update does, 
where to ind more information about it, and a help and support link.
 
5.  When done reading the information, click Close.
 
6.  If you want to copy the information about the update to another application, select 
Copy details in the contextual menu shown in step 3. You can then use the Paste 
option to transfer the information to its destination.
 
7.  When you’re done reviewing the history of updates, close the View update history 
window.
CLEAN UP Close the Windows Update window.

 
Removing Installed Updates  415
Removing Installed Updates
If you mistakenly installed a Windows Update, such as an incorrect or old driver, or sim-
ply an update that you do not really need, you can uninstall it at any time.
In this exercise you will learn how to remove installed updates from your computer.
SET UP Open Windows Update.
 
1.   Click Installed Updates, which is located at the bottom of the left column.
The Installed Updates window opens. Here you can see all the installed updates, 
separated by category.
 
2.  Scroll through the list and click the update you want to remove.
Tip  To ind the update you want to remove more quickly, use the sorting function for 
each of the available columns. For example, if you click the Name column, all updates will 
be sorted by name, in ascending order. If you click it again, the names will be sorted in 
descending order. You can do the same with the other columns.
 
3.  Click Uninstall.
You are asked to conirm the uninstall operation.

416  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
4.  Click Yes.
The uninstallation process now starts.
 
5.  When inished, you are taken back to the Installed Updates window.
 
6.  Repeat steps 2 to 5 for all the updates that you want to remove.
The update you selected is now removed from your computer, and it will be avail-
able again for selection during the next update check.
CLEAN UP Close the Windows Update window.
What Is Windows Defender?
Windows Defender is an application built to detect and remove spyware and other simi-
larly harmful programs. It is included by default in all versions of Windows 7, and it can 
be used to protect your system. However, there are better alternatives available, including 
some that are free, such as Microsoft Security Essentials, which provide both spyware and 
virus protection.
If you choose to use Windows Defender, this section will cover the basics you need to 
know about how this application works and how to use it.

 
Opening Windows Defender  417
Opening Windows Defender
Due to the fact that Windows Defender doesn’t offer a lot of security features (it sticks 
only to spyware protection), Microsoft has chosen to hide it somewhat within the 
Windows 7 operating system. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have a direct application short-
cut in the Start menu. You need to search a bit in order to access it.
In this exercise, you will learn how to open Windows Defender.
SET UP Open the Control Panel.
 
1.  On the upper-right side of the Control Panel window, look for a line that says View 
by. Click the menu near it, then select Large icons.
This displays your Control Panel items alphabetically, similar to the way they were 
presented in Windows XP.
 
2.  Scroll down until you ind the items that begin with the letter W.
 
3.  Click the Windows Defender shortcut.
The Windows Defender window opens.

418  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Tip  Another way to launch Windows Defender is to type the word defender in the Start menu 
search box, then click the Windows Defender search result.
CLEAN UP In the Control Panel window, click the View By menu again, then select 
Category. This will revert your Control Panel to its original appearance. If you don’t 
make this change, you might have issues completing other exercises, because the 
Control Panel structure will be different from the default view.
Using Windows Defender
The Windows Defender interface is pretty easy to understand and use. There are no 
sophisticated options, but only the things you would expect from a spyware protection 
solution. 
In this exercise, you will learn the basics of how to use Windows Defender.
SET UP Open Windows Defender.

 
Using Windows Defender  419
 
1.  The Windows Defender window has ive application areas: Home, Scan, History, 
Tools, and Help. You also have Back and Forward buttons to help you navigate 
through the different application areas you access.
Back
Forward
 
2.  When you start the application, you are brought to window called Home. This 
window shows details such as the date of the last system scan, the status of the 
Real-Time Protection offered by the application, the version of the deinitions used 
to identify spyware, plus different application messages, such as the need for new 
deinitions. If you are in a different area and you want to access these statistics, click 
Home.
 
3.  If you want to run a quick scan for spyware, click Scan.
The scan process begins. After a few minutes, the results are displayed.

420  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
4.  If you want to make a full system scan for spyware or a custom one, click the arrow 
beside Scan, then choose the option you want. If you select Custom scan, you are 
asked to deine the parameters (which drives or folders should be included) of the 
custom scan before starting the process.

 
Using Windows Defender  421
 
5.  If you want to check the activities performed by Windows Defender in the past, 
click History.
This loads a quick report with the alerts you received during the time you used this 
application and the actions you selected for it to perform.
 
6.  If you want to conigure different aspects of Windows Defender, click Tools.
This opens the Tools And Settings section. Here you can conigure the way you 
want Windows Defender to run. Also, you can join the Microsoft SpyNet commu-
nity and help identify spyware infections. You can view all the Quarantined items, 
the Allowed Items list, and access the Windows Defender Web site or the Microsoft 
Malware Protection Center portal.

422  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
7.  If you want to get help regarding Windows Defender and learn how to use it, click 
the Help icon (the question mark).
This opens the Windows Help And Support window, which contains help informa-
tion about Windows Defender.

 
Using Windows Defender  423
 
8.  If you want to access other options beside Help, click the arrow adjacent to the 
Help icon. This opens a menu with additional options: View Help, Check for 
updates, View privacy statement online, and About Windows Defender 
(this shows information such as client version, engine version, and antispyware 
deinitions).
These are all the interface elements and functionalities of the Windows Defender 
application.
CLEAN UP When you’re done working with the tool, close Windows Defender.

424  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Turning Off Windows Defender
If you decide to install a complete Internet security solution or security products other 
than Windows Defender, it is best to irst turn it off. Having multiple security solutions 
with similar features enabled is not good idea, as it can create problems between the  
different security applications and cause them to malfunction.
In this exercise, you will learn how to turn off Windows Defender.
SET UP Open Windows Defender.
 
1.  Click Tools.
The Tools And Settings window opens.
 
2.  Click Options.
This opens a list of coniguration options, organized by type.

 
Turning Off Windows Defender  425
 
3.  Click Administrator.
This opens the list of administrative settings that are available for this tool.
 
4.  Clear the Use this program check box.
 
5.  Click the Save button.
This disables Windows Defender. A conirmation window pops up to tell you the 
tool is turned off.

426  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
6.  Click the Close button.
CLEAN UP Now that Windows Defender is turned off, don’t forget to install a more 
complete security solution. It is not safe to use your computer without a security 
solution that provides anti-spyware protection.
Turning On Windows Defender
There are times when you might need to turn on Windows Defender again. One 
such scenario might be if you want to run a quick scan to see if your other security 
solution hasn’t escaped any threats. Having Windows Defender run a quick scan 
can be a good idea.
In such a scenario, all you need to do is to open Windows Defender. When you do 
this, you are notiied that it is turned off.
Click the click here to turn it on link. The application starts automatically, and you 
can now use it again.

 
What Is the Windows Firewall?  427
Important  If you have other security products installed, don’t leave Windows Defender 
turned on as well, unless you are absolutely sure it doesn’t conlict with the other 
solutions. It is best to run a quick double-check scan, make sure no spyware threats are 
left unidentiied on your computer, and then turn it off again.
What Is the Windows Firewall?
The Windows Firewall is a security application that is built into Windows 7. It helps block 
unauthorized access to your computer while permitting authorized communications to 
and from your computer. This application has been improved with each new version of 
Windows.
Windows 7 now allows this tool to ilter both inbound and outbound trafic or set rules 
and exceptions depending on the type of network you are connected to. If you are not 
using a third-party security suite that includes a irewall, then it is highly recommended 
that you use the Windows Firewall; it does provide a good level of security.
This section will detail all there is to know about the Windows Firewall and how to use it.

428  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Understanding How the Windows Firewall Works
Windows Firewall has a predeined set of rules that is applied as soon as it is turned on. 
By default, it allows you to do many things: browse the Internet; use instant messaging 
applications; connect to a Homegroup; share iles, folders, and devices with other com-
puters; and so on. The rules are applied differently depending on the network location 
set for your current network connection. 
See Also  For more information about network locations, see the “Setting the Network Loca-
tion” section in Chapter 4, “Creating the Network.”
Some of the applications that you install on your computer (such as uTorrent, for exam-
ple), automatically add an exception to the Windows Firewall so that they work as soon 
as you launch them. However, if they don’t add such an exception, Windows Firewall asks 
you to allow them access to the Internet. At this point, you receive a security alert (similar 
to the one shown in the image that follows), in which you are asked to select the network 
locations that you will allow to access the application: private networks (such as home or 
work networks), or public networks (such as airports, coffee shops, etc.).
By default, Windows Firewall selects the appropriate check box for the network that you 
are currently using. However, you can select either of the two options or both, depending 
on what you want to do. When you’re done, click Allow Access to allow the application 
to communicate on the selected type(s) of network. To block access, simply click Cancel.

 
Opening the Windows Firewall  429
Note  If you do not have administrator access, you are not able set any exceptions, and the 
programs that do not comply with the standard set of rules are automatically blocked.
Opening the Windows Firewall
The Windows Firewall is turned on by default in Windows 7, and it runs silently in the 
background, as a service. The application prompts you whenever you need to make a 
decision, and you don’t need to open it unless you want to see its status or conigure it 
to better meet your needs.
In this exercise, you will learn how to open the Windows Firewall.
SET UP Open the Control Panel.
 
1.  Click System and Security.
The System And Security panel opens, with all tools and coniguration options 
available for this category.
 
2.  Click Windows Firewall.
The Windows Firewall application opens to its main window.

430  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Tip  Another way to launch Windows Firewall is to type the word irewall in the Start 
Menu search box, and then click the Windows Firewall search result.
 
3.  In the center of the window, you can see information about the status of your 
network connections and how the Windows Firewall is set for each type of connec-
tion. In the left column, there are links to different coniguration options for the 
Windows Firewall and other tools such as the Action Center.
See Also  To learn more about how to conigure the Windows Firewall and how to work with it, 
see the following sections.
CLEAN UP When you are done working with the tool, close the Windows Firewall 
window.
Turning the Windows Firewall On or Off
If you choose to install a third-party security application, such as a complete Internet 
security suite or simply another irewall, it is best to disable the Windows Firewall so that 
it doesn’t create conlicts and problems. 
In this exercise, you will learn how to disable the Windows Firewall and how to enable it 
again, when needed.
SET UP Log on as administrator and open the Windows Firewall.

 
Turning the Windows Firewall On or Off  431
 
1.   Click the Turn Windows Firewall on or off link, which is located in the left 
column.
This opens the Customize Settings window, which shows if the application is turned 
on. By default, the Windows Firewall is turned on for both types of network locations: 
Home Or Work (Private) and Public. You can choose to turn it on or off for both or 
just for one of the locations.
 
2.  If you want to turn it off for a network location, select the Turn off Windows 
Firewall (not recommended) option. If you select this option for both network 
locations, the Windows Firewall will be turned off completely. If you choose it for 
one, Windows Firewall will be turned off only when you connect to that type of 
network location.
 
3.  To turn the Windows Firewall on for a network location, select the Turn on 
Windows Firewall option.

432  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
4.  Beneath the Turn on Windows Firewall option, there are two other settings you 
can make.
The irst blocks all incoming connections to your computer. We do not advise 
enabling this unless you want your computer to not be available to anyone or any 
application. The second addresses receiving notiications when the Windows Fire-
wall blocks a new program. We advise that you enable this option; otherwise,  
if an application doesn’t access the network or the Internet correctly, you won’t 
know why. Check any of these options that you want to enable.
 
5.  When you have inished, click OK.
You are returned to the Windows Firewall window.
CLEAN UP Close the Windows Firewall window.
Important  You can turn Windows Firewall on or off only if you are logged on as an 
administrator. This setting will apply to all users deined on your computer. Also, if you 
disable the Windows Firewall, make sure that your user and others have proper security 
alternatives installed.
Customizing the List of Allowed Programs
The Windows Firewall allows you to edit its communication rules so that you can permit 
or deny network access for certain applications or services. In this exercise, you will learn 
how.
SET UP Log on as administrator and open the Windows Firewall.
 
1.   Click the Allow a program or feature through Windows Firewall link.
The Allowed Programs window opens, which contains all the programs that are 
allowed to go through the Windows Firewall. By default, the list is not editable—
you can use it for viewing purposes only.

 
Customizing the List of Allowed Programs  433
Important When the Allowed Programs window opens, some of the program name 
check boxes are selected. This means that the rules deined for those programs are active 
and used by the Windows Firewall. The programs that are not selected don’t have any 
active rules used by the Windows Firewall. There are also some selected check boxes in 
the Home/Work (Private) and Public columns. If a check box is selected in any of these 
columns, it means that the rule deined for that program is applied to the selected 
network location. Some programs have rules for one network location, while others have 
rules for both. The rules are active only for the network locations that are selected.
 
2.  To view details about any allowed program, select it, then click Details.
A window opens that presents the properties for the selected application.

434  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
3.  When done reading the information, click OK.
This closes the properties window of the application and returns you to the list of 
allowed programs.
 
4.  To modify any of these settings, click Change settings.
This causes the Change Settings button to become dimmed and the list of allowed 
programs and features to become editable. 

 
Adding New Programs to the Allowed List  435
 
5.  You can now edit the list of active rules, add new programs and features to the list, 
or remove existing rules. When you’re done making changes, click OK.
The changes you made are now applied.
See Also  To learn how to edit the list of active rules, read the following sections in this chapter.

you have inished, close the Windows Firewall window.

 
Removing Programs or Disabling Rules from the Allowed List   439
Removing Programs or Disabling Rules from  
the Allowed List
Removing programs from the list of allowed programs through the Windows Firewall or 
disabling active rules can be done just as easily as adding them. In this exercise, you will 
learn how.
SET UP Log on as administrator and open the Windows Firewall. Go to the Allowed 
Programs window and make the list of allowed programs and features editable, as 
shown in the “Customizing the List of Allowed Programs” section.
 
1.  Select the rule you want to disable or remove.
 
2.  If you want to disable the rule, simply clear the check box on the left side of the 
rule name. It will no longer be used by the Windows Firewall.
 
3.  If you want to disable the rule for a certain network location only, clear the cor-
responding check box found in the column of that network location.
For example, if you want a rule to not be applied to the program when you are 
connected to a public network, clear the check box from the Public column. The 
same applies for Home/Work (Private) network locations.
 
4.  If you want to remove the program from the list of allowed programs, click 
Remove.
You are asked to conirm the removal.

for the rules you want to disable. When you have inished, close the Windows Firewall 
window.
Gaining Additional Control by Using the Windows Firewall 
with Advanced Security
The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security is a tool that allows a lot more con-
trol over the rules applied by the Windows Firewall to protect your computer. With 
it, you can tweak all properties of every security rule, deine new rules, or disable 
undesired ones. This tool is quite advanced, so if you just want to stick to the basics, 
it is best not to iddle with it. However, if you want to be more hands-on regarding 
the security rules applied to your computer, then this tool is of great utility.
This section will give you an overview of the Windows Firewall with Advanced Secu-
rity and its major capabilities.

 
Removing Programs or Disabling Rules from the Allowed List   441
Opening the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security is simply a more advanced way of 
showing the rules that govern the functioning of the Window Firewall. The same 
settings are shown in a different and complex way, each with the complete set of 
parameters applied to it.
To access it, irst open the Windows Firewall. Then, click Advanced Settings. This 
opens the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security window.
Tip  Another way to access this is to search for the word irewall in the Start menu search, 
and then click the Windows Firewall With Advanced Security shortcut.
In the center of this window, you can see the status of the Windows Firewall. 
On the left side, there is panel in which you can access the currently deined rules 
(inbound, outbound, and connection security rules) and monitor what is going on 
with the Windows Firewall.  

442  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
On the right side, there is the Actions panel, in which you can deine actions to 
take. This panel changes dynamically, presenting varying options based on the 
items you access in the left panel. 
Understanding Inbound, Outbound, and Connection Security Rules
In order to provide the security you need, the Windows Firewall has a standard set 
of rules that are used depending on the location of the network to which you are 
connected. These rules are split into three categories:
 
●Inbound rules These rules are applied to the trafic that is coming from the 
network or the Internet to your computer. Inbound trafic includes: iles that 
you are copying from another computer to yours, iles downloaded from a 
Web page, e-mails received, remote connections made to your computer over 
the network or the Internet, and so on. These rules can be conigured so that 
they are speciic to computers, users, programs, services, ports, or protocols. 
You can also specify to which type of network adapter (for example, wireless, 
cable, virtual private network) or user proile they are applied.
 
●Outbound rules These are rules that apply to the trafic going from your 
computer to the network or the Internet. Outbound trafic includes: connect-
ing to a Web site to browse its contents, uploading iles to a Web page, send-
ing an e-mail, remote connections made from your computer to another over 
the network or the Internet, and so on. These rules can be conigured so that 
they are speciic to computers, users, programs, services, ports, or protocols. 
You can also specify to which type of network adapter (for example, wireless, 
cable, virtual private network) or user proile they are applied. 
 
●Connection Security rules These rules are used to secure trafic between two 
computers while it crosses the network. One example would be a rule specify-
ing that connections between speciic computers must be encrypted. Unlike 
the inbound or outbound rules, which are applied only to one computer, 
connection security rules require that both computers have the same rules 
deined and enabled. By default, there are none deined for Windows 7 or 
Windows Vista computers. They are generally deined by users or a network 
administrator (in business networks). For the typical activities done over a 
home network, such rules are not required to be deined. There’s no need for 
you to implement them on your home network.

 
Removing Programs or Disabling Rules from the Allowed List   443
You can access the rules deined in each category by clicking the appropriate sec-
tion on the left panel of the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security window. In 
each section, there are rules marked with either a green check mark or a gray one. 
The green check marks represent active rules, and gray check marks represent dis-
abled rules that are not used by the Windows Firewall.
Viewing and Modifying the Properties of a Rule
You can easily view the properties of a rule (inbound, outbound, or connection 
security). To do so, simply right-click the rule in which you’re interested, then select 
Properties. This opens the Properties window for the selected rule.

444  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
The properties are organized by category, each with its own tab: 
 
●General This includes the name of the rule, a description of the rule, whether 
it is enabled or not, and if it allows or blocks a connection.
 
●Programs and Services This tab shows which programs and Windows ser-
vices the rule applies to.
 
●Computers On this tab, you can see whether or not this rule applies to 
speciic computers. If no computer is speciied, then the rule applies to con-
nections to all computers.

 
Removing Programs or Disabling Rules from the Allowed List   445
 
●Protocols and Ports On this tab, you see the list of protocols and ports to 
which the rule applies.
 
●Scope This tab shows if the rule applies to speciic IP addresses or to any 
address.
 
●Advanced On this tab, you can see which type of network location and 
network adapter (network device) the rule applies to and if it allows the 
computer to accept unsolicited inbound trafic that has passed through other 
devices such as routers or irewalls.
 
●Users On this tab, you see the user accounts to which the rule applies and 
the ones to which it doesn’t apply. If no speciic user account is listed, it means 
it applies to all user accounts.
To modify the properties of the rule, you can simply use the available options in 
each of the tabs. Once you have set up the coniguration you need, simply click OK 
and the changes are applied.
Monitoring with Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Monitor
The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security also offers some monitoring features. 
If you click on the Monitoring section in the left panel, you can access several moni-
toring reports, organized by category.

446  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
This is what is shown in each category:
 
●Firewall This category shows all the active inbound and outbound rules used 
by the Windows Firewall to function.
 
●Connection Security Rules This shows all active Connection Security rules.
 
●Security Associations This category shows the security associations currently 
established on your computer, including detailed information about their 
settings and endpoints. A security association deines the shared security 
information used to protect the communications between two computers: 
your computer and another one.
Note  Security associations are generally used in business networks where computers 
need to share information in a more secure environment. They don’t generally apply to 
home networks.
Creating a New Rule
As you can imagine, the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security allows you to create 
your own custom rules that include even more advanced settings than the default ver-
sion of the Windows Firewall.
In this exercise, you will learn how to create your own rules in the Windows Firewall with 
Advanced Security.
For this exercise, we will use as an example creating a rule for the ActiveSync application 
included in Windows operating systems. ActiveSync is the client used to connect and 
synchronize Windows Mobile phones to Windows computers. This application is useful 
for many owners of Windows Mobile smartphones. In order for the application to func-
tion properly, it uses the following inbound TPC ports: 990, 999, 5678, 5721, 26675, and 
outbound UDP port 5679. Let’s create a rule for the inbound ports.
SET UP Log on as administrator and open the Windows Firewall with Advanced 
Security.
 
1.  Go to the Action menu, then click New Rule.
The New Inbound Rule Wizard opens. You will use this to create the new rule.

 
Creating a New Rule  447
 
2.  Select the type of rule you want to create. Your options are: Program, Port, 
Predeined, and Custom. For our exercise, select Port.
 
3.  Click the Next button.
You are asked to select the type of protocols and provide the actual ports to  
which the rule applies.

448  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
4.  ActiveSync uses TCP inbound ports 990, 999, 5678, 5721, and 26675. Therefore, 
select TCP.
 
5.  Select Speciic local ports and type 990,999,5678,5721,26675. 
If you need to add a rule to all ports, select All Local Ports.
 
6.  Click Next.
You are asked to select which type of action the rule will take: allow or block.
 
7.  For our exercise, we need to allow trafic through the TCP protocol and the ports 
mentioned in step 4. Therefore, select Allow the connection.
 
8.  Click Next.
You are asked to select to which type of network location the rule applies.

 
Creating a New Rule  449
See Also  For more information about network locations, see the “Setting the Network 
Location” section of Chapter 4, “Creating the Network.”
 
9.  Select the type of network locations where the rule should be applied. For our 
exercise, it is best to have this rule enabled for safer locations such as Domain and 
Private. Select the Domain and Private check boxes and clear the Public check 
box.
 
10.  Click Next.
You are now at the last step in the wizard.
 
11.  Type the name you want your rule to have. Make it something descriptive so that it 
gives you a good idea about what the rule does.

450  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
12.  Type the description for the rule that provides a bit more detail.
 
13.  Click Finish.
The rule is now created and allows TCP inbound trafic for ports 990, 999, 5678, 
5721, and 26675.
CLEAN UP To create a rule for the outbound trafic used by ActiveSync, follow the 
same steps. At step 4, you need to select UDP and then type the port 5679. The 
rest of the procedure is the same. When done, you can close Windows Firewall with 
Advanced Security.
Important  The principles in the New Inbound Rule Wizard are the same for all types of rules. 
Only certain coniguration options differ, based on the type of rule you deine: program, port, 
predeined, or custom. For all rules, you need to specify the action to be taken, the network 
proile to which it applies, and the rule name and description.
Enabling, Disabling, or Deleting an Existing Rule
Just like with the standard Windows Firewall, the Windows Firewall with Advanced Secu-
rity allows you to enable inactive rules, disable active ones, or simply delete rules you no 
longer need. In this exercise, you will learn how to do this.
SET UP Log in as administrator and open the Windows Firewall with Advanced 
Security.

 
Enabling, Disabling, or Deleting an Existing Rule  451
 
1.  Open the category of the rule that you want to disable (inbound, outbound, or 
connection security) and select the rule that you want to enable, disable, or delete.
 
2.  Right-click the rule to open the contextual menu.
Tip  You can select multiple rules by pressing and holding the Ctrl key on your keyboard 
and selecting the rules with the mouse.
 
3.  If the rule is active and you want to disable it, select Disable Rule. 
 
4.  If the rule is inactive and you want to enable it, select Enable Rule.
 
5.  If you want to remove the rule, select Delete.
You are asked to conirm your choice.
 
6.  Click Yes.
The rule is now enabled, disabled, or deleted, according to your selection.
CLEAN UP Repeat the procedure for all the rules you want to enable, disable, or 
delete. When done, you can close Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
Important  Before disabling or deleting a rule, make sure that you understand what it does and 
what this change means to the security of your system. If you are not sure about what its impact 
will be, it is best not to iddle with it. Also, if your Windows Firewall seems to be acting out 
of your control, it is best to reset its settings by using the instructions found in the following 
section.

452  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Restoring the Windows Firewall Default Settings
If you have been using this tool for a long time and have made many changes to its set-
tings, chances are that some things might stop working. For such cases, it is best to reset 
all rules to the default settings and values created by Microsoft. Then you can start from 
scratch and deine the rules that apply to your programs so that everything works again 
as it should.
In this exercise, you will learn how to restore the default settings of the Windows Firewall.
SET UP Log on as administrator and open the Windows Firewall.
 
1.   Click Restore defaults.
The Restore Defaults Window opens, in which you are warned about the conse-
quences of the change you are about to make.
 
2.  Read the information shown and click Restore defaults.
You are asked to conirm your action.

3.  Click Yes.
You are returned to the Windows Firewall window, and all the settings you created 
are deleted. Everything is now reset to the initial settings and values existing at the 
time when Windows 7 installed on your computer.
CLEAN UP When you have inished, close the Windows Firewall window.
Protecting Your Computer from Viruses and  
Other Security Threats
In order to have a safe and pleasant computing experience, it is highly recommended to 
install complete security solutions such as Internet security suites (which include antivirus, 
anti-spyware, irewall, and other protection features) or individual antivirus, anti-spyware 
and irewall solutions. 
Windows 7 offers by default built-in irewall and anti-spyware solutions, which were 
covered in the prior sections of this chapter. However, they are not enough to completely 
secure your system. 
Why Should I Install Additional Security Solutions in Windows 7?
This is a question many people ask. Windows 7 offers by default a pretty good 
protection level. The Windows irewall protects from network and Internet threats, 
while Windows Defender protects your computer from spyware. Unfortunately, this 
is not enough. With only these solutions enabled, you won’t have any form of pro-
tection from computer viruses and other more advanced threats such as rootkits (a 
form of “virus” which is able to hide its presence by concealing its processes from 
the monitoring mechanisms of your operating system). 

454  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
In order to be completely protected, you need to install at least an antivirus solu-
tion on top of the Windows Firewall and Windows Defender.
The best way to remain protected is to use a complete security package, generally 
called an Internet Security Suite. These packages include antivirus, anti-spyware, 
and irewall protection, plus other security modules, such as spam ilters for your 
e-mail client, monitors for your Internet browser, parental controls, and so on.
Finding Security Solutions Compatible with Windows 7
There are many security solutions on the market, most of them commercial. How-
ever, there are also free solutions available. Before making a choice, it is best to see 
which options are available on the market. In order to make an informed decision, 
we recommend that you check the following Internet sources:
 
●Consumer security software providers (http://www.microsoft.com/windows
/antivirus-partners/windows-7.aspx) This Microsoft page lists all of the 
security software providers that offer solutions compatible with Windows 7, 
Windows Vista, and Windows XP. 
 
●Security for Everyone at 7 Tutorials (http://www.7tutorials.com
/security-everyone) The 7 Tutorials Web site provides a series of reviews 
for the latest Internet Security Suites. The 7 Tutorials team regularly tests the 
latest offerings from both a security and usability perspective. The aim of the 
reviews is to highlight those solutions that provide the best mix of security 
and user friendliness.
 
●AV Comparatives (http://av-comparatives.org) This is the Web site of an 
independent security organization that regularly tests the quality of security 
provided by antivirus products. Their tests are very professional and evaluate 
all the important security aspects of an antivirus solution. If you want to know 
which security company has the best detection engine for viruses, this Web 
site is the place to visit.

net security solutions. If you want to know the latest top 10 together with a 
complete feature comparison table, this Web site is a good destination.
Using the Action Center
Windows 7 comes with a convenient way to help you review the state of your system and 
ind solutions to security and maintenance issues. The feature that facilitates this is called 
the Action Center, and it is built upon the foundation set by the Windows Security 
Center, which was irst introduced by Windows XP Service Pack 2 and then tweaked by 
Windows Vista. This section will explain all the functionality of the Action Center and 
show how to conigure it so that you receive only the notiications that are relevant 
to you.
Explaining the Action Center
Action Center continuously monitors the state of your system’s security. If it notices 
any kind of problem, such as your antivirus being disabled, it immediately notiies 
you so that you can take corrective action. It also monitors a series of maintenance-
related items, including checking whether you have any scheduled system backups, 
trying to ind solutions to recent computer issues, and checking for any maintenance 
problems, and so on.
When a problem is detected, the user is notiied and guided to what he can do to 
ix it. 

456  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
Messages Displayed by the Action Center
In the notiication area of the Windows 7 taskbar, there’s always a little white lag 
icon. This is the icon of the Action Center. When there are messages for the user, 
the white lag is overlaid by one of two icons: a red x, and a black clock. The red x 
overlay indicates that there is at least one important message, so you need to pay 
attention. The black clock overlay means that there is a scheduled task running in 
the background (for example, a scheduled Windows Defender scan). 
Hover the mouse cursor over the lag icon and you see a tooltip, giving you some 
brief information about what is happening with your system. 
To see the list of messages that you need to pay attention to, click the Action  
Center icon (the white lag).

 
Opening the Action Center and Reviewing Its Messages   457
Opening the Action Center and Reviewing  
Its Messages
Reviewing the list of messages displayed by the Action Center is a simple task. There 
are few steps to follow, and the way the tool communicates with the user is very easy 
to understand. There’s no complicated jargon involved, and typically, you can intuitively 
understand what the tool recommends for you to do to keep your computer secure and 
your data backed up properly.
In this exercise, you will learn how to open the Action Center and review its messages.
SET UP Go to the notiication area of the taskbar (the lower-right side of the screen).
 
1.   Click the Action Center white lag icon.
This shows a summary of the current active messages.

3.  The messages shown by the Action Center are split into two categories: Security 
and Maintenance. To maximize or minimize either of these two categories, click the 
arrow to the right of the category name.
Tip  All messages shown by the Action Center use the following color coding: Red means 
it is a very important message that you should not ignore, and yellow indicates that it is a 
recommendation that can be ignored if you do not consider it important.
You can check all the messages and recommendations shown by the tool and decide 
what you want to do about them. To learn more about the possible messages you can 
receive, read the sidebar “Explaining the Action Center Messages” that follows the Clean 
Up instructions.
CLEAN UP When you have inished working with the tool, close the Action Center.

 
Opening the Action Center and Reviewing Its Messages   459
Explaining the Action Center Messages
The Action Center informs you when the following problems are identiied:
 
●Windows Update (Important) This message warns you that Windows 
Update is set to never check for updates, leaving your computer exposed to 
all sorts of security risks. The recommended setting is to automatically down-
load and install updates. To review the available options, click the Change 
Settings button, then select the appropriate update option.
 
●Spyware and unwanted software protection (Important) This message 
warns you that Windows Defender or any other anti-spyware solution you 
installed is turned off. To see a list of available options, click View Antispyware 
Programs.
 
●Virus protection (Important) This message occurs when your antivirus is 
not installed, is disabled, or uses outdated deinitions. It is strongly recom-
mended to either install an antivirus application, turn on your antivirus (if you 
already have one), or update your antivirus deinitions.
 
●User Account Control (Important) This message warns you that the User 
Account Control is disabled.
 
●Network irewall (Important) This message warns you that Windows 
Firewall or the irewall you installed (for example, ESET, ZoneAlarm, Symantec, 
Kaspersky, and so on) is turned off. You should always have a irewall turned 
on. To see the available options, click View Firewall Options. 
 
●Internet security settings (Important) This message occurs when certain 
Internet Explorer security settings are conigured lower than their default 
level. You can easily reset them to the desired level by clicking the Restore 
Settings button in the Action Center message about Internet security.
 
●Network Access Protection This message refers to a security feature 
deployed in corporate environments to manage health information for client 
computers in a centralized manner. This setting depends on the Network 
Access Protection Agent service and further software settings; it will not be an 
issue for home users.
 
●Set up backup This message notiies you that you should set up a backup 
task. This is not as important as the preceding security issues, although if you 
have enough available storage space, you could set your system to perform 
regular backups of your iles and settings.

460  Chapter 13 Keeping the Network Secure
 
●Check for solutions to problem reports This message notiies you about 
reported problems with your software and hardware and checks for solutions 
online.

updates, either for Windows components or for other Microsoft products.
 
●Troubleshooting: System Maintenance This message notiies you about 
any maintenance routines that need to be carried out in order to help your 
computer run more smoothly.
Coniguring the List of Messages Displayed by the 
Action Center
The great thing about the Action Center is that it is a very conigurable application. You 
can easily customize which type of alerts and messages you want to receive, depending 
on how you have conigured your Windows 7 installation and the additional software 
you installed.
In this exercise, you will learn how to conigure the list of messages that is displayed by 
the Action Center.
SET UP Open the Action Center.
 
1.  Click the Change Action Center settings link on the upper-left side of the Action 
Center window.

date with the latest patches from Microsoft.
 
●Using Windows Defender can be a useful security measure if you do not use more 
complete security suites. If you do have more complete security solutions installed, 
it is best to disable Windows Defender so that it doesn’t create conlicts.
 
●The Windows Firewall is a great security tool you can use to protect against 
unauthorized connections to your computer.
 
●The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security is a special view of the Windows 
Firewall with which you can create advanced security rules.
 
●It is very important for you to have antivirus protection on your system. Don’t 
hesitate to read the Web sites we recommend so that you can ind the best security 
solution that works for you.
 
●By using the Action Center, you get a good perspective on the status of your sys-
tem, and you are always notiied when Windows 7 identiies problems.

Controls
In this chapter, you will learn how to
4 Turn on Parental Controls.
4 Set time limits and application restrictions.
4 Set up restrictions for games.
Your home network is now up and running. Everything is correctly set and you can share 
media, libraries, folders, and devices between the computers on your network. But there’s 
one more thing to consider: If you have children using computers on the home network, 
it’s a good idea to use Parental Controls. This feature of Windows 7 allows you to deine 
when children can use the computer (during which days of the week and at what time 
intervals in each day), which games they are allowed to play, and which programs they 
are allowed to use.
In this chapter, you will learn how to turn on Parental Controls, how to deine time limits, 
and how to apply restrictions for games and applications.
Practice Files You do not need any practice iles to complete the exercises in this 
chapter.
Turning On Parental Controls
Before setting up Parental Controls, you need to create a standard user account for your 
child that has no administrative permissions. If your child’s user account has administra-
tive permissions, he will have all the required rights to override any controls you want to 
apply.
See Also  To learn more about user accounts and how to set them up, see Chapter 2, “Setting 
User Accounts on All Computers.”

466  Chapter 14 Setting Up Parental Controls
Once you have created a user account for your child, you can begin enabling Parental 
Controls. In this exercise, you will learn how to do that.
SET UP Open the Control Panel.
 
1.  Click User Accounts and Family Safety.
The User Accounts And Family Safety panel opens, which contains all the settings 
related to user accounts.
 
2.  Click Parental Controls.
The Parental Controls panel opens. You are asked to which user account you want 
to apply Parental Controls.

 
Turning On Parental Controls  467
 
3.  Select your child’s user account (which, for the purposes of this exercise, is named 
7 Tutorials Child).
The User Controls window opens. Here you can see if Parental Controls are enabled 
for the selected user account, and if they are enabled, what types of limits are 
deined (time limits, game ratings, or program limits).

468  Chapter 14 Setting Up Parental Controls
 
4.  Select the On, enforce current settings option.
 
5.  Click the OK button.
Parental Controls are now enabled, using the default settings. Note that the default 
settings do not apply any limits to your child’s user account. To learn how to deine 
limits, read the following sections.
CLEAN UP There is no cleanup required.
Setting Time Limits and Application Restrictions
Now that Parental Controls are enabled, it’s time to deine the restrictions you want 
applied. The easiest restrictions you can deine are related to the time when the com-
puter can be used by your child and which applications she is allowed to use.
In this exercise, you will learn how to set restrictions.
SET UP Open Parental Controls.
 
1.  Select your child’s user account.

 
Setting Time Limits and Application Restrictions  469
The User Controls window opens. On the right side of the window, you can see if 
any limitations are currently applied.
 
2.  First, let’s apply limits to when your child can use her account. Click Time Limits.
Note  If you are not interested in setting time limits, skip to step 7.
The Time Restrictions window opens, in which you can see a table comprised of the 
days of the week and the hours in a day. By default, the table is empty (the squares 
are all white), which means no time restrictions are deined.

470  Chapter 14 Setting Up Parental Controls
 
3.  To block a certain hour in a day, simply click the appropriate square.
The square turns blue, which indicates that you child cannot use the computer at 
that particular hour during that particular day of the week.
 
4.  Click all the squares that correspond to the hours and days for which you want to 
block access.
The previous image shows how the table needs to be completed if you want to 
block access each day (between 10 P.M. and 8 A.M.) so that your child doesn’t stay 
up late at night playing on the computer.
 
5.  If you want to cancel blocking a time slot, simply click it again and it will turn white.
 
6.  When you have inished setting the time slots, click OK.
You are returned to the User Controls window.
 
7.  To set applications restrictions, click Allow and block speciic programs.
You are asked to decide which programs your child’s user account can use.
 
8.  Select the second option, which is the one that has can only use the programs I 
allow appended to the name of the user account (in this exercise, 7 Tutorials Child 
can only use the programs I allow).
A list appears that shows the currently installed applications on your computer.

 
Setting Time Limits and Application Restrictions  471
 
9.  Select the check boxes adjacent to the programs that your child can use and leave 
the check boxes cleared for the ones that you don’t want him to use.
 
10.  If a program is not on the list, click Browse, navigate to its location, and then 
select it.
 
11.  When you have inished selecting the programs your child can access, click OK.
You are returned to the User Controls window.
 
12.  Click OK.
CLEAN UP Close the Parental Controls window.

472  Chapter 14 Setting Up Parental Controls
Setting Restrictions for Games
Another important parental control option you might want to take advantage of is set-
ting up restrictions for the kinds of games your child can play. This can be very important 
to you, especially if he is very young. Fortunately, Parental Controls makes it very easy for 
you to set such restrictions.
In this exercise, you will learn how to set restrictions for the games your child is allowed 
to play.
SET UP Open Parental Controls.
 
1.  Select your child’s user account.
The User Controls window opens. 
 
2.  Click Games.
The Game Controls window, in which you can block and allow games based on a 
variety of criteria, opens.

 
Setting Restrictions for Games  473
 
3.  You are asked if you allow your child to participate in computer games. Select No if 
you don’t want your child to play any games at all. Select Yes if you want to allow 
game play.
If you select No, all the other options are grayed out and you can end the exercise 
at this step (there are no other settings to be made).
 
4.  If you want to block or allow games by rating and content type, click Set game 
ratings.
The Game Restrictions window opens, displaying a long list of restrictions you can 
deine.
 
5.  Select whether you allow your child to play games that have no rating. 
Unrated games are usually casual games. They can be downloaded from the 
Internet, mostly from smaller independent publishers. Select Allow Games With No 
Rating or Block Games With No Rating, depending on your preference. 

474  Chapter 14 Setting Up Parental Controls
 
6.  You are asked to select the acceptable ratings for your child.
The list contains the standard ratings as deined by the Entertainment Software Rat-
ing Board: Early Childhood, Everyone, Everyone 10+, Teen, Mature, and Adults Only. 
Read carefully what each rating means and select the maximum rating allowed for 
your child, depending on his or her age—and your personal preference.
Scroll down a bit farther and you ind another list that contains more speciic types 
of content that you can block. These restrictions will be applied in addition to the 
general rating you just set. The list of content that can be blocked is comprehen-
sive. It includes anything from intense violence to mild language. Select the types 
of content that you want to block. 

 
Setting Restrictions for Games  475
 
7.  When you have inished setting restrictions, click OK.
You are returned to the Game Controls window.

476  Chapter 14 Setting Up Parental Controls
 
8.  To block or allow games by a speciic name, click Block or Allow speciic games.
The Game Overrides window opens, in which you can individually choose the 
games (from those installed on your computer) that your child is allowed to play.

 
Setting Restrictions for Games  477
 
9.  For each game installed on the computer, you have three choices: 
 
●User Rating Setting The game will be allowed or blocked, based on the 
game rating and the rules you deined.
 
●Always Allow The game is allowed, independent of the other restrictions 
that you have set (rating or type of content).
 
●Always Block The game is always blocked, independent of other deined 
restrictions.
For each of the games on your computer, select your desired setting.
 
10.  When you have inished setting the games from the list, click OK.
You are returned to the Game Controls window.
 
11.  Click OK.
The Game Controls window closes and you are returned to the User Controls 
window.
 
12.  Click OK.
The game restrictions you have deined are now applied to your child’s user 
account.

478  Chapter 14 Setting Up Parental Controls
CLEAN UP Close the Parental Controls window.
Understanding Messages from Parental Controls When 
Restrictions Are Applied
When your child wants to log on to the computer during a day and hour that is set 
as blocked, she will receive the following message: “Your account has time restric-
tions that prevent you from logging on at this time. Please try again later.”
Your child will be unable to log on unless you set that speciic slot as allowed.
If you have set restrictions for games, those games that are restricted display an 
icon (the well-recognized red circle with a diagonal line through its center) to indi-
cate the restricted status. Also, if your child tried to play a restricted game, a pop-
up window appears with the message, “Parental Controls has blocked this game.”

 
Key Points  479
If your child tries to run a blocked program, again, a pop-up window appears with 
the message, “Parental Controls has blocked this program.”
Important  The tricky part about blocked programs is that Parental Controls will allow 
some of the Windows-speciic programs to run, even if they are not marked as allowed 
(for example: Calculator and Internet Explorer). However, any third-party applications that 
are installed on the computer won’t be allowed to run on your child’s user account unless 
marked as allowed.
Key Points
 
●Turning on Parental Controls can be done only if your child has a standard user 
account.
 
●You can easily set time limits in addition to restrictions on applications and games.
 
●Game restrictions can be set using many criteria, including the rating and the types 
of content they contain.
 
●Your child is notiied each time he tries to log on at a restricted time or run a 
blocked game or application.

Identifying and Resolving Wireless Connectivity Problems
The most commonly reported networking problems are related to wireless con-
nectivity. Many people have dificulty with older routers that don’t work well with 
newer operating systems such as Windows 7 and Windows Vista. Other problems 
might be the result of incorrect wireless network card drivers installed on the oper-
ating systems. The list of possible problems is almost endless. In order to help, we’ve 
created some lowcharts that should help you identify what is wrong when wireless 
connection problems occur.

 
Fixing Problems Using the Network and Internet Troubleshooting Wizards  487

Important  Some older routers are not really compatible with Windows 7. If you have a 
model older than three to four years, you probably need upgraded irmware for it, or you 
need to replace it with a newer model. To learn if your router is compatible with Windows 
7, you can check the Windows 7 Compatibility Center Web site, which you can ind at 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx.

Changing the Date and Time Settings on Your 
Computer to Resolve a Password Error
One of the problems you might encounter when joining the Homegroup is receiving 
a “The password is incorrect” error, even if you have typed the correct Homegroup 
password. 
This error is actually not related to the password you typed; it is the result of the date and 
time settings not being synchronized between your computer and the computer that 
created the Homegroup in the irst place. In order to resolve it, you need to set the date 
and time correctly on both computers or simply change it on your computer to match 
the settings on the computer that created the Homegroup, even if those settings are not 
correct.

 
Changing the Date and Time Settings on Your Computer to Resolve a Password Error  491
In this exercise, you will learn how to change the date and time settings on your 
computer.
SET UP Go to the notiication area of your computer’s taskbar and click the time.
 
1.  Click the Change date and time settings link.
The Date And Time window opens, in which you will make all the necessary 
changes.

492  Chapter 15 Troubleshooting Network and Internet Problems
Note  Alternatively, you can search for the word date in the Start search box, then click 
Date And Time.
 
2.  Click the Change date and time button.
The Date And Time Settings window opens. This is the window in which you  
actually change the date and time.
 
3.  Change the date in the Date box and the time in the Time box to match the cor-
responding settings on the computer that created the Homegroup.
 
4.  Click OK.
You are returned to the Date And Time window.
 
5.  Click Change time zone.
The Time Zone Settings window opens.

 
Coniguring Port Forwarding Settings on Your Router   493
 
7.  In the Time zone drop-down list, select the time zone so that it matches with the 
computer that created the Homegroup.
 
8.  Click OK.
You are returned to the Date And Time window.
 
9.  Click OK.
The date and time settings on your computer are now synchronized with the com-
puter that created the Homegroup.
CLEAN UP Restart the procedure to join the Homegroup.
Important  If you are running Windows 7 in a virtual machine and this error occurs, even 
though the date and time of the virtual machine and the computer that created the 
Homegroup are synchronized, the problem is likely the result of having incorrect network 
connection settings for your virtual machine. You are probably using Network Address 
Translation (NAT). In order for the joining to be successful, you need to use the Bridged 
connection.
Coniguring Port Forwarding Settings  
on Your Router
In a typical home networking setup, the router is the center of your home’s Internet 
connection. All trafic goes through it and is iltered by it. By default, your router will 
block trafic through the ports that are considered nonstandard use. For example, games 
that can be played online (for instance, FIFA 11), applications such as BitTorrent clients 
(uTorrent, Blizzard Downloader, BitComet), Windows Media Player, or VPN (Virtual Private 
Network) applications need to use speciic ports that may be blocked by your router, 
depending on how it is conigured. In such a scenario, the games or applications you use 
won’t be able to fully connect to the Internet and function correctly.
Therefore, you need to establish which ports are used by these games or applications 
and “unblock” them in the router’s settings by performing what is called manual port 
forwarding.
What is port forwarding? 
First, you need to understand that every Internet Protocol (IP) Address (the address used 
by your computer to be identiied on the network) is divided into thousands of ports. 
When your computer sends data to another computer, it sends it from a port on its IP 
Address to a port on the other computer’s IP Address. A port can be used only by one 

494  Chapter 15 Troubleshooting Network and Internet Problems
program at a time. If the router blocks a port used by a game or an application, it cannot 
communicate and send data to the computer where it needs to send it. Port forwarding 
is when you conigure your router to allow communication through a certain port for a 
certain IP Address that is used by a computer on your network. For example, you would 
use this with a computer on which you have set up Windows Media Player 12 to do 
media streaming over the Internet. This way, you can connect to another computer from 
work or a friend’s house and exchange media with it. If Windows Media Player 12 doesn’t 
show the remote computers in the Other Libraries section, even if the coniguration 
you’ve done is correct, it means the ports used by the application to do media streaming 
over the Internet are blocked. The ports used by Windows Media Player 12 for remote 
media streaming are TCP 44442 and 443. You need to map them both to port 10245.
See Also  For more information about IP Addresses and what this concept is, check out the 
Glossary and the “Installing and Coniguring Your Router” section, in Chapter 1 “Setting Up 
Your Router and Devices.”
In this exercise, you will learn how to set up manual port forwarding. For the purposes of 
this exercise, we use a Belkin N+ Wireless router.
SET UP Open your router’s administration page.
 
1.  Type the administrator password to access your router’s settings.
 
2.  Go to the Port Forwarding coniguration page.
Depending on your router, the path might be very different. For example, on Belkin 
routers it is found in the Firewall -> Virtual Servers section. On Linksys routers it 
is found in the Applications & Gaming -> Port Range Forwarding section. On 
D-Link routers it is found in the Advanced -> Port Forwarding Rules section.
In this page, you can see the current ports that are forwarded and for which of the 
computers in your home network.

 
Coniguring Port Forwarding Settings on Your Router   495
 
3.  Go to an empty entry and select the Enabled check box.
 
4.  Type a description for the port forwarding you are about to do.
To make things easier, it is best to type the name of the application that uses the 
ports you are about to forward. For our exercise, you could type WMP12.
 
5.  Type the inbound port used by the application. In our example of Windows Media 
Player 12, it is 44442. Type 44442 in both ields in the Inbound port column. 
Note  If you need to open a range of ports—let’s say from 44442 to 44445—you could 
type 44442 in the irst ield and 44445 in the second. This would open all the ports 
between the start and end port.

496  Chapter 15 Troubleshooting Network and Internet Problems
 
6.  Select the type of trafic that is allowed through this port. Your choices are TCP 
(Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), or Both (TCP and 
UDP). Windows Media Player 12 uses TCP. Therefore, select TCP.
 
7.  In the next column, type the IP Address of the computer for which you want to 
open the speciied port. 
 
8.  In the next column (Private Port on Belkin routers), you need to specify to which 
port you want to map the speciied inbound port you typed at step 5. Most times, 
this is identical to the inbound port. However, Windows Media Player 12 needs you 
to map port 44442 to 10245. Therefore type 10245 in both ields.
Note  You can also specify a range of ports, if needed, as described in the Note in step 5.
 
9.  Click Apply Changes (or Save Settings on other routers).
Now inbound port 44442 is mapped to 10245, and the router permits TCP trafic 
for your computer for this combination of ports.
CLEAN UP Repeat the procedure and map all the ports as you need. For Windows 
Media Player 12, you also need to map port 443 to 10245 so that remote streaming 
via the Internet functions correctly. In the case of remote media streaming, you 
should also repeat this procedure on the router that ilters the trafic of the network 
where the other computer is located.
Important  A port forwarding rule on your router is applied only to the computer with the 
speciied IP Address. Other computers are still blocked from using the rule. If you want a port 
forwarding rule to be applied to all computers on your home network, you need to create a 
rule for each computer.
See Also  If your router’s coniguration pages are very different than the ones described in this 
exercise, it is best to consult your router’s manual and learn how to implement port forwarding 
on your speciic model.
