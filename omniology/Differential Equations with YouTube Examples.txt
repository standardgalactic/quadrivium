Preface
Preface
This review book, used in conjuction with free online YouTube videos, is designed to help students 
prepare for exams, or for self-study. The topics covered here are most of the standard topics covered in 
a first course in differential equations.
The chapters and sections of this review book, organized by topics, can be read independently. Each 
chapter or section consists of three parts: (1) Theory; (2) YouTube Example; and (3) Additional Practice. 
In Theory, a summary of the topic and associated solution method is given. It is assumed that the student 
has seen the material before in lecture or in a standard textbook so that the presentation is concise. In 
YouTube Example, an online YouTube video illustrates how to solve an example problem given in the 
review book. Students are encouraged to view the video before proceeding to Additional Practice, which 
provides additional practice exercises similar to the YouTube example. The solutions to all of the practice 
exercises are given in this review book’s Appendix. 
For students who self-study, or desire additional explanatory materials, a complete set of free lecture 
notes by the author entitled An Introduction to Differential Equations can be downloaded by clicking 
HERE. This set of lecture notes also contains links to additional YouTube tutorials. The lecture notes 
and tutorials have been extensively used by the author over several years when teaching an introductory 
differential equations course at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

1.1	
Separable equations
Theory:
A separable first-order ode for y = y(x) can be written in the form 
y′ = f(x)
g(y) ,
with initial conditions y(x0) = y0. To solve a separable equation, treat y′ = dy/dx  like a fraction and 
multiply by g(y)dx  to obtain 
g(y)dy = f(x)dx.
Then integrate both sides to obtain 
 y
y0
g(y)dy =
 x
x0
f(x)dx.
Perform the integrations and solve for y when possible. If there are multiple solutions for y, choose the 
one that satisfies the initial condition. 
YouTube Example:
To review separable odes, click HERE, which solves 
(1 + y)y′ = x,
y(0) = 0.
Additional Practice:
Solve the following separable odes for y = y(x).
1.	 y′ = √xy,
y(1) = 0 
2.	 y2 −xy′ = 0,
y(1) = 1 
3.	 ex−yy′ + ey−x = 0,

4.	 y′ + (sin x)y = 0,

Linear equations
Theory:
A linear first-order ode for y = y(x) can be written in the form 
y′ + p(x)y = g(x),
with initial condition y(x0) = y0. To solve a linear equation, if necessary multiply by an integrating

Exact equations
Theory:
An exact first-order ode for y = y(x) can be written in the form 
M(x, y) + N(x, y)y′ = 0,
or equivalently, 
M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0,
where for some function f = f(x, y), the functions M(x, y) and N(x, y) satisfy M = ∂f/∂x  and 
N = ∂f/∂y . An exact ode can therefore be rewritten in the form 
∂f
∂x + ∂f

or equivalently, 
d

x, y(x)

= 0.
Integrate to obtain 
f(x, y) = c,
where c is a constant. 
To test whether a given differential equation is exact, compute ∂2f/∂x∂y in two ways to obtain the 
necessary condition 
∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x.
If this condition is satisfied, determine the function f(x, y) by first integrating with respect to x 
the equation 
∂f
∂x = M(x, y)
to obtain an equation in the form 
f(x, y) = F(x, y) + h(y),

where h(y) is the constant (independent of x) of integration. To determine h(y), differentiate with 
respect to y to obtain 
h′(y) = N(x, y) −∂F
∂y .
Then integrate to obtain h(y). Absorb all the constants of integration into the final constant c.

Bernoulli equations
Theory:
A Bernoulli first-order ode for y = y(x) can be written in the form 
y′ + p(x)y = q(x)yn,
n ̸= 0, 1.
To solve a Bernoulli equation, write as

A first-order homogeneous ode for y = y(x) can be written in the form 
y′ = F(y/x)
for some function F. To solve a homogeneous equation, let

Theory:
A Riccati first-order ode for y = y(x) can be written in the form 
y′ = P(x)y2 + Q(x)y + R(x).
If a particular solution y = Y (x) of this equation is known, then to solve a Riccati equation, let

u) + R(x).
Expand the quadratic, and use the equation satisfied by the particular solution y = Y (x), 
Y ′ = P(x)Y 2 + Q(x)Y + R(x),
to transform the Riccati equation into the linear equation

Homogeneous equations
Theory:
A homogeneous, second-order, constant-coefficient ode for x = x(t) can be written in the form 
a¨x + b ˙x + cx = 0,
where a, b, and c are constants. To solve, try 
x(t) = ert,
where r is a constant to be determined. Substitute into the ode and cancel the common exponential 
function to derive the characteristic equation 
ar2 + br + c = 0;
and factor or use the quadratic formula to obtain the two roots. Consider the following three cases. 
1.	 Two real roots. Write the roots as r = r1, r2 and the general solution as 
x(t) = c1er1t + c2er2t.
2.	 Complex conjugate roots. Write the roots as r = λ + iµ  and its complex conjugate, and the 
general solution as 
x(t) = eλt (A cos µt + B sin µt) .
3.	 One real root. Write the root as r and the general solution as

Second-order differential equations with constant coefficients 
where n, α or β may be zero. Sometimes a sum of such functions is presented. Find particular solutions 
for each term in the sum separately and add them, or treat the sum as a whole. 
To find a particular solution, try the trial function 
x(t) =

a0tn + a1tn−1 + · · · + an

eαt cos βt
+

b0tn + b1tn−1 + · · · + bn

eαt sin βt,
where the a’s and b’s are the undetermined coefficients. Substitution into the differential equation should 
result in a sufficient number of algebraic equations for the undetermined coefficients. 
If any term in the trial function is a solution of the homogeneous equation, then multiply the trial 
function by an extra factor of t (or t2 when the characteristic equation has repeated roots).

The Laplace transform 
3	 The Laplace transform 
Theory:
Define the Laplace transform of a function f(t), denoted by F(s) = L{f(t)} , as 
F(s) =
 ∞
0
e−stf(t)dt.
Performing this integral for various functions f(t) results in the table of Appendix A. In particular, the 
first and second derivatives of x(t) are transformed as 
L{ ˙x(t)} = sX(s) −x(0),
L{¨x(t)} = s2X(s) −sx(0) −˙x(0).
To solve a constant-coefficient, inhomogenous differential equation for x = x(t) of the form 
a¨x + b ˙x + cx = g(t),
where x(0) and ˙x(0) are given, Laplace transform the differential equation for x(t) into a solvable 
algebraic equation for X(s), and then inverse Laplace transform X(s) back into x(t). To find x(t) using 
the table, use the techniques of partial fraction decomposition and completing the square.
Typically, the Heaviside step function, uc(t), and the Dirac delta function, δ(t −c), are encountered when 
studying the Laplace transform technique. Both functions may appear in the inhomogeneous term and 
are used to model piecewise-continuous and impulsive forces.

Theory:
A power series solution around x = 0 can be used to solve a linear, homogeneous equation for y = y(x) 
of the form 
P(x)y′′ + Q(x)y′ + R(x)y = 0,
where P(x), Q(x) and R(x) are polynomials or convergent power series with no common polynomial 
factors, and P(0) ̸= 0.

Now write the sum P(x)y′′ + Q(x)y′ + R(x)y  as a single power series by shifting summation indices either

Cauchy-Euler equations
5	 Cauchy-Euler equations
Theory:
The Cauchy-Euler equation for y = y(x) can be written in the form 
x2y′′ + αxy′ + βy = 0,
with α and β constants. Here, assume that x > 0. (To obtain solutions with x < 0, replace x by  
−x .) To solve, try 
y(x) = xr,
where r is a constant to be determined. Substitute into the ode and cancel the common power law factor 
to derive the characteristic or indicial equation 
r2 + (α −1)r + β = 0;
and factor or use the quadratic formula to obtain the two roots. Consider the following three cases. 
1.	 Two real roots. Write the roots as r = r1, r2 and the general solution as 
y(x) = c1xr1 + c2xr2.
2.	 Complex conjugate roots. Write the roots as r = λ + iµ  and its complex conjugate, and the 
general solution as 
y(x) = xλ
A cos (µ ln x) + B sin (µ ln x)

.
3.	 One real root. Write the root as r and the general solution as

Systems of linear equations Theory:
6	 Systems of linear equations
Theory:
A system of first-order, linear, homogeneous odes can be written in matrix form as 
˙x = Ax,
where x = x(t) is an n-dimensional column vector and A is a constant n-by-n square matrix. To solve, try 
x(t) = veλt,
where v is a constant n-dimensional column vector and λ is a constant scalar. Substitute into the ode 
and cancel the common exponential function to obtain the eigenvalue problem 
Av = λv,
with characteristic equation 
det(A −λI) = 0.
Find n linearly independent solutions and use the principle of superposition to find the general solution. 
Consider eigenvalues of three different types. 
1.	 Real eigenvalue. With eigenvalue λ and eigenvector v, write one solution as x1(t) = veλt . 
2.	 Complex conjugate eigenvalues. With complex eigenvalues λ and ¯λ , and complex 
eigenvectors v and ¯v, write two solutions as x1(t) = Re (veλt) and x2(t) = Im (veλt). 
3.	 Repeated eigenvalue with fewer eigenvectors than eigenvalues. If the real eigenvalue λ has 
multiplicity 2, say, and there is only one linearly independent eigenvector v, then write one 
solution as x1(t) = veλt  and seek a second solution by trying x(t) = (w + tv)eλt  with w an 
unknown constant vector. Solve the equation (A −λI)w = v for w. Higher multiplicities 
can also be treated. 
If A is a two-by-two matrix, then write the characteristic equation as λ2 −Tr(A)λ + det(A) = 0. 
Represent the solutions in a phase portrait, which plots the trajectories of x2 versus x1 for various 
initial conditions. To sketch a phase portrait, consider three cases.

a single eigenvector. If the eigenvalue is negative, then draw arrows on the corresponding line 
pointing toward the origin; if the eigenvalue is positive, then draw arrows pointing away from 
the origin. Sketch trajectories corresponding to initial conditions with mixed eigenvectors. If 
both eigenvalues are negative, call the origin a sink or a stable node; if both eigenvalues are 
positive, call the origin a source or an unstable node; and if the eigenvalues have opposite sign, 
call the origin a saddle point. Below is a sample phase portrait for eigenvalues of opposite sign.

2.	 Complex conjugate eigenvalues. If the real part is negative, call the origin a stable spiral 
point and draw trajectories that spiral into the origin. If the real part is positive, call 
the origin an unstable spiral point and draw trajectories that spiral out of the origin. If 
the eigenvalues are pure imaginary, call the origin a center and draw trajectories that 
are closed ellipses. To determine the direction of rotation, compute L = x1 ˙x2 −x2 ˙x1, 
using the odes to eliminate ˙x1 and ˙x2 in favor of x1 and x2. If L is positive, then draw 
counterclockwise spirals and if L is negative, draw clockwise spirals. Below is a sample phase 
portrait for complex conjugate eigenvalues with a positive real part and with L < 0.

7	 Nonlinear differential equations
7.1	
Fixed points and linear stability analysis
Theory:
An autonomous, nonlinear ode for x = x(t) can be written in the form 
˙x = f(x),
where f(x) is a nonlinear function of x and independent of t. To determine the fixed points of the ode, 
solve the equation f(x) = 0 for x = x∗. To determine the linear stability of a fixed point, compute f ′(x). 
If f ′(x∗) < 0, then the fixed point is stable, and if f ′(x∗) > 0, then the fixed point is unstable. 
A two-dimensional, autonomous, system of nonlinear odes can be written in the form 
˙x = f(x, y),
˙y = g(x, y).
To determine the fixed points of this system, solve the simultaneous equations f(x, y) = 0 and g(x, y) = 0 
for (x, y) = (x∗, y∗). To determine the linear stability of a fixed point, compute the Jacobian matrix given by 
J =

∂f/∂x
∂f/∂y
∂g/∂x
∂g/∂y

.
Evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the fixed point and compute its eigenvalues. If both eigenvalues have 
negative real parts, then the fixed point is stable. If at least one of the eigenvalues has a positive real 
part, then the fixed point is unstable. Use of the Jacobian to determine stability can be generalized to 
higher-dimensional systems.

which considers 
˙x = x2 −1.
To review how to find the fixed points of a system of nonlinear odes and to determine their stability,

2.	 ˙x = x(1 −x2) 
3.	 ˙x = x(1 −2x −y),
˙y = y(1 −x −2y) 
7.2	
Bifurcation theory
Theory:
A bifurcation occurs in a nonlinear differential equation when a small change in a parameter results in 
a qualitative change in the asymptotic solution. For example, bifurcations occur when fixed points are 
created or destroyed, or change their stability. 
A nonlinear differential equation with a bifurcation parameter r can be written in the form 
˙x = fr(x).
At a bifurcation point, multiple fixed points coalesce, resulting in four classic one-dimensional bifurcations. 
1.	 Saddle-node bifurcation. Two fixed points – one stable and the other unstable – are created 
or destroyed. 
2.	 Transcritical bifurcation. Two fixed points cross and exchange stability. 
3.	 Supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. A stable fixed point becomes unstable and two 
symmetric stable fixed points are created. 
4.	 Subcritical pitchfork bifurcation. A stable fixed point becomes unstable and two symmetric 
unstable fixed points are destroyed. There are no local stable fixed points above the 
bifurcation point, and the system usually jumps to a far away stable fixed point that may 
have been created in two symmetric saddle-node bifurcations below the bifurcation point. 
Identify a bifurcation point by setting both fr(x) and f ′
r(x) equal to zero. The bifurcation diagrams 
representing the four classic one-dimensional bifurcations are shown below.

1.	 Let M = 2x −3y  and N = 2y −3x. Then My = Nx = −3 so the equation is exact. 
From fx = M we obtain f = x2−3xy+h(y),, and from fy = N we obtain h′(y) = 2y  or 
h(y) = y2.  The general solution is x2 −3xy + y2 = c.
2.	 Let M = x2+2xy−y2 and N = x2−2xy−y2. Then My = Nx = 2x−2y so the equation is

h′(y) = −y2  or h(y) = −y3/3. The general solution is x3/3 + x2y −xy2 −y3/3 = c.
3.	 Since y/x + (ln x)y′ = (y ln x)′, the general solution is y ln x = c.

Mθ = Nr = 4r sin θ cos θ −sin θ so the equation is exact. From fr = M  we obtain 
f = r cos θ +r2 sin2 θ +h(θ), and from fθ = N we obtain h′(θ) = 0. The general solution is

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

1.	 (a) Try x = Ae2t. We obtain 4A + 6A + 2A = 1, or A = 1/12. The particular solution 
is xp = 1
12e2t.
(b) The inhomogeneous term is a solution of the homogeneous equation. Try x = ty, with 
y = Ae−2t a solution of the homogeneous equation. We have ˙x = y + t ˙y, ¨x = 2 ˙y + t¨y. 
Since ¨y + 3 ˙y + 2y = 0, we have 2 ˙y +3y = e−2t or −4A+3A = 1, or A = −1. The particular 
solution is xp = −te−2t.
2.	 (a) Try x = A sin 2t + B cos 2t so that ˙x = 2A cos 2t −2B sin 2t and 
¨x = −4A sin 2t −4B cos 2t. Then ¨x + 3 ˙x + 2x = (−4A −6B +
2A) sin 2t + (−4B + 6A + 2B) cos 2t = sin 2t. Matching coefficients, we have 
−2A −6B = 1 and 6A −2B = 0, with solution A = −1/20, B = −3/20. The particular 
solution is xp = −1
20(sin 2t + 3 cos 2t).
(b) Same as (a) except we have −2A −6B = 0  and 6A −2B = 1, with solution 
A = 3/20, B = −1/20. The particular solution is 
/
xp = 1
20(3 sin 2t −cos 2t).
3.	 (a) Try x = At + B, so that ˙x = A and ¨x = 0. Then ¨x + 3 ˙x + 2x = 2At + (3A + 2B) = 2t. 
Matching coefficients, we have 2A = 2 and 3A + 2B = 0, or A = 1 and B = −3/2. 
The particular solution is xp = t −3/2.
(b) Try 
x = At2 + Bt + C,, 
so 
that 
˙x = 2At + B 
and 
¨x = 2A. 
Then 
¨x+3 ˙x+2x = 2At2+(6A+2B)t+(2A+3B+2C) = t2+2t.  Matching coefficients, we have 
2A = 1, 6A + 2B = 2,, and 2A + 3B + 2C = 0, or A = 1/2, B = −1/2, and C = 1/4. 
The particular solution is xp = 1
2t2 −1

4.
4.	 The homogeneous solution is xh = c1e−t + c2e−2t and the particular solution 
is xp = −te−2t. The general solution is x = c1e−t + c2e−2t −te−2t. Using 
˙x = −c1e−t −2c2e−2t −e−2t + 2te−2t, initial conditions result in c1 + c2 = 0 and 
c1 + 2c2 = −1, or c1 = 1 and c2 = −1. The solution is 𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑒𝑒−𝑡𝑡(︀

3.	 a)  Try y = xr. We obtain r(r −1) −r + 1 = 0, or (r −1)2 = 0, with repeated root 
r = 1.The general solution is y(x) = x(c1 + c2 ln x), with y′(x) = c1 + c2(1 + ln x). 
Boundary conditions result in c1 = 1 and c1 + c2 = 0, yielding c2 = −1. The solution is 
y(x) = x(1 −ln x).
b)	 Try y = xr. We obtain 4r(r −1) + 1 = 0, or (2r −1)2 = 0, with repeated root r = 1/2. The 
general solution is y(x) = √x(c1 + c2 ln x). Boundary conditions result in c1 = 1 and 
√e(c1 + c2) = 0, yielding c2 = −1. The solution is y(x) = √x(1 −ln x).

Fixed points and linear stability analysis
1.	 Fixed points are determined from f(x) = 4x2 −16 = 0, with solutions x∗= ±2. Linear 
stability is determined from f ′(x) = 8x, with f ′(−2) = −16 < 0 and f ′(2) = 16 > 0. 
Therefore x∗= −2 is stable and x∗= 2 is unstable.
2.	 Fixed points are determined from f(x) = x(1 −x2) = 0, with solutions x∗= 0, ±1. Linear 
stability is determined from f ′(x) = 1 −3x2, with f ′(0) = 1 > 0 and f ′(±1) = −2 < 0. 
Therefore x∗= 0 is unstable and x∗= ±1 is stable.
3.	 Fixed points are determined from f(x, y) = x(1 −2x −y) = 0 and 
g(x, y) = y(1 −x −2y) = 0. Three obvious fixed points are (x∗, y∗) =
(0, 0), (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0). The fourth fixed point satisfies 2x + y = 1 and x + 2y = 1, or 
(x∗, y∗) = (1/3, 1/3). The stability of these fixed points is determined from the eigenvalues 
of the Jacobian matrix J at the fixed points, where
	
J =

.
The fixed points (0, 0), (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0) have at least one positive eigenvalue and are unstable. 
The eigenvalues of the fourth fixed point are the two solutions of the quadratic equation 
λ2 + 4
3λ + 1
3 = 0, both of which are negative. Therefore, the fixed point (1/3, 1/3) is stable.

Bifurcation theory
1.	 f(x) = r −cosh x. At the bifurcation point, both f(x) = 0 (cosh x = r) and 
f ′(x) = 0 (sinh x = 0). The bifurcation occurs when r = 1 and x = 0. Taylor series 
expanding cosh x to second order yields f(x) = (r−1)−x2/2. This is a saddle-node 
bifurcation with fixed points x = ±

2(r −1), which only exist when r ≥1. Stability of 
these two branches is computed using f ′(x) = −x, so that the upper branch is stable and 
the lower branch is unstable.
2.	 f(x) = x(r −sinh x). At the bifurcation point, both f(x) = 0 (x = 0 or sinh x = r ) and 
f ′(x) = 0 (sinh x + x cosh x = r). The bifurcation occurs when r = 0 and x = 0. Taylor 
series expanding sinh x to second order yields f(x)= rx−x2, which is the normal form for 
a transcritical bifurcation.
3.	 f(x) = rx −sinh x. At the bifurcation point, both f(x) = 0 (sinh x = rx) and 
f ′(x) = 0 (cosh x = r). The bifurcation occurs when r = 1 and x = 0. Taylor series 
expanding sinh x to third order yields f(x) = (r −1)x −x3/6. This is a supercritical 
pitchfork bifurcation with fixed points x = 0 and x = ±

6(r −1), the latter which only 
exist when r ≥1.
4.	 f(x) = rx −sin x. At the bifurcation point, both f(x) = 0 (sin x = rx) and 
f ′(x) = 0 (cos x = r). We consider the bifurcation that occurs when r = 1 and x = 0. 
Taylor series expanding sin x to third order yields f(x)= (r −1)x + 1
6x3. This is a 
subcritical pitchfork bifurcation. Fixed points near the bifurcation point r = 1 are given by 
x = 0 and x = ±

6(1 −r),, the latter which only exist when r ≤1.
