Introduction 
 
Have you ever imagined of how much money those huge 
online casinos make? What if we could get some of that 
money by exploiting their system? 
 
With this method we will be taking advantage of how the 
system of the biggest online casino works. The said casino is the 
Party brands (www.partypoker.com, www.particasino.com, 
etc.). The Party Brands is the biggest online gambling empire. 
They have an enormous number of games, players and of 
course huge profits. This is where we kick in to get some of 
those profits. 
 
Can this method be applied to other online casinos too? 
 
I believe this method could work on other casinos too, but 
in this casino it is much easier, because they accept “Sarah” as a 
payment method, which makes our life much easier. 
 
 
 

 
Sarah: Explained 
 
 
I think it is time to reveal who is this mysterious Sarah. As 
you have already understood, Sarah is a payment method. It 
will let us create many accounts, using different billing 
information, and also keep ourselves anonymous. Don’t worry, 
nothing illegal is done. So, to use this method, go to 
http://www.entropay.com and register for an account. 
 
 

 
 
Entropay is a company that issues virtual credit cards that 
you can reload with money whenever you want, and the best 
thing is that you can create as many of those virtual credit cards 
as you like. Now, the cool thing is that the Party casino and all 
the party brands, accept Entropay as a different payment 
method, and they accept it from every single country in the 
planet. There is also another bunch of payment methods, but 
some are limited to certain countries, and probably you won’t 
be able to use the same PayPal or Credit Card, for 2 accounts. 
 
I am not going to go through the registration process, 
because it is really simple.  
 
Once you have registered for an account, you need to add 
a funding source, which will be your credit card. You will use 
this funding source in order to top up your virtual credit cards 
with money and then use them as a deposit method in the 
online casino. It is really simple to create a new virtual credit 
card. Once you log into your account, you will see this screen: 

 
 
 
Simply click on the “Create Card” link, and follow the 
instructions. It should take less than 1 minute. As you can see 
by the dates, I am using it regularly. I currently have only 4 
virtual credit cards, because I am destroying the ones I don’t 
need any more. You can do that too, to keep things smooth and 
organized. 
 
 
 

The method: Explained 
 
 
Now, after you have created your Entropay account, it is 
time to use it in the casino. Sign up as an affiliate here:

I would appreciate it if you signed up with the link above. It will just help 
me earn some more money for letting you know this method and you won’t lose 
anything. I get a percentage of what you make, so if I was not 100% certain that 
you will make money with this method, I wouldn’t bother asking you to become 
my referral. 
 
 
Now, let’s explain the method. Once you register as an 
affiliate, you will need to create a “tracker” which you will use 
to “invite” people to join the casino as players (make sure your 
create a CPA-Cost Per Action-Tracker for partypoker.com). At 
that point, I am almost certain that you are think “What the 
fuck? Not another referral program e-book. These things do not 
work.”, but please go ahead and read the whole e-book and try 
the method following exactly my steps and you will be proven 
wrong. 

 
 
Use those settings when creating a Tracker: 
 

The Party Brands Company will pay you $75+ (as shown in 
the image below) for every player that registers through your 
tracker. The catch is that this player must qualify as a “RMP – 
Real Money Player” in order for you to get the commission. To 
qualify as an RMP, a player must: 
 Deposit at least $25 on his first deposit. 
 Earn at least 5 partypoints. 
 

 
 
Also, the player that sign ups with your Tracker Code, will 
get a 100% first deposit bonus. This means that if he deposits 
$25, then he will get another $25 in his account (he needs to 
earn some partypoints to unlock the bonus, but we will cover 
how to do it without gambling and risking your money). 
 
What we will be doing is: 
1) Register new accounts as our referrals, 
2) Play with ourselves and transfer money from one account 
to the other by winning/losing in poker, so that we earn 
partypoints (you may need some friends to help you with 
that, or maybe a second PC). 
 
Do not freak out, I will explain what to do and how to do it 
thoroughly. There are 2 options here. You can either create 
only one player account referred by you (option 1), or create 6 
player accounts referred by you (option 2) so that you can play 
poker. Poker table sizes are 6 and 10 seats, so you need either 6 
or 10 accounts if you want to get a table by yourself and not 
risk losing money to some stranger. Now you are probably 
wondering what you need to do if you decide to create only 1 

account at first. Below, I will describe the steps that you need 
to follow for EVERY account that you will be making, either you 
choose option 1 or option 2. When we come to the point, I will 
describe what to do to earn partypoints if you choose option 1. 
 
Steps you need to follow when creating a new account: 
 Sign out from the affiliate account and delete all your 
cookies. 
 
 Delete all the flash cookies – You can download a 
firefox add-on that automatically clears your flash 
cookies when you exit firefox. It is called “Better 
Privacy”, and you can get it here: 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/ 
 
 Get behind a VPN (doesn’t matter what country). You 
can get a good list of free VPNs from my thread here: 
http://www.hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1031723 
 
 Find fresh Socks4 or Socks5 (either will do). Do NOT 
use a US sock because they do not allow US players in 
the casino. UK socks are suggested. You can find fresh 
socks here: 
http://www.xroxy.com/proxy-type-Socks5.htm 

or you can download this program that looks like a 
VPN but is using socks, and has a lot of UK socks in it: 
http://www.easy-hide-ip.com/ 
 
 Sign up to partypoker.com using your Tracker Bonus 
Code. 
 
 Create a new Entropay card and load it with $25+. 
You can do this before getting under VPN and Socks, 
for faster browsing, but it does not make any 
difference when you choose to do it. 
 
 Make a deposit to your newly created account using 
the Entropay payment deposit method. 
 
 If you chose option 2, make 5 more accounts using 
the same steps. Now you either need friends that can 
help you, or download multiple browsers, get a 
different sock on them (only manually, not with easy-
hide-ip), login to each account from one browser, join 
the same table, win/lose money in a circle (example: 
bet $1 with every account, and then fold with all 
except the last one, then repeat with another 
account, etc.). This way you earn partypoints, so each 
of the accounts verifies as an RMP, you get credited 

$75 for every account, and you also unlock the 
bonuses from each account. Once the bonuses are 
unlocked, gather all the money to one account, and 
withdraw it to your Entropay card from where you 
can either withdraw to your own Credit Card, or 
transfer to new Entropay Cards and reinvest in new 
accounts. 
 
 If you chose option 1, find the game called “Virtual 
Horse Racing”.  This game is very well hidden, 
because it gives easy partypoints. You cannot find this 
game in the website. You need to download their 
client. IMPORTANT: If you download their client, you 
need to have either socks configured in Internet 
Explorer, or run the easy-hide-ip program for which I 
talked before. This is very important, or else your IP 
address will look like the VPN’s IP, and you don’t want 
that. Now that you have downloaded and ran the 
client, type in the search bar in the casino games 
“Virtual Racing” and you will find the game. Click to 
play and you will see that there are 2 options: 
Greyhounds, and Horses. I suggest playing only on the 
Greyhounds. You get 1 partypoint for every $5 that 
you bet there, so even if you bet all the $25 that you 
deposited and lose it all, you still get credited the $75. 

What you will be doing is betting on multiple 
Greyhounds on the “Place” column. This means that 
you are betting that this hound will end either first or 
second. There are 8 hounds and I usually bet on 6 of 
them. See the odds provided and try to get a 
balanced outcome, so that you will either lose very 
little money or win very little money in any case. This 
way, you get partypoints by staying on your money +- 
a small amount. I personally always let the two 
hounds with the lowest odds, without betting. In 
order to lose all the money, the outcome must be 
that those two specific hounds came at the two first 
places, which is almost impossible, but even if it 
happens, there is no problem as we explained before. 
 
Make sure you follow ALL those steps described above, if 
you want to get paid and not get banned. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Getting Paid 
 
As you can see, by choosing the option with the more 
accounts, you can make more money and faster, but it needs 
larger investment and also is a little hard to manage all the 
accounts if you don’t have friends who can help you. But, either 
option that you may choose, you can clearly see the 
opportunity to make big amounts of money. 
The casino pays commissions to its affiliates once a month, 
so you should receive your payment at the first week of the 
next month from which you generated the commissions. There 
are various payment methods, and you can once again use 
Entropay Card as your payment method. This is what I am 
doing, to stay anonymous, just for better security.
