Generations of Wireless
I First generation wireless systems used Analog technologies to provide 
circuit-switched access for mobile voice telephony
• AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System)
• MTS, IMTS, NMT, TACS, ETACS, JTACS, others
I Second generation wireless systems use the earliest digital technologies 
to provide mainly circuit-switched access for mobile voice telephony
• GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) TDMA
• IS-54, IS-136 TDMA
• IS-95 CDMA
I Third generation wireless systems use improved digital technologies to 
provide packet-switched access for advanced voice and data applications
• wider-bandwidth, higher-capacity, more features and applications
• CDMA2000 1xRTT, 1xEV DO, DV, 3xRTT - migration path from IS-95
• GPRS & UMTS - migration path from GSM and IS-136 TDMA
• EDGE - migration path from TDMA, but will anybody use it?
I Fourth Generation technologies are erupting into the marketplace, a 
revolution that could topple (or be absorbed by) the established players

2G Wireless Data:
S L O W !
I Each wireless technology offers 
limited data capability today
I One or more circuit-switched 
traffic channels are dedicated to 
fast data instead of voice
• Dial-up modem emulation is 
provided at the wireless 
switch
• Packet data access may be 
provided by a router at the 
switch, but the RF link is 
circuit-switched
• Data rates are slow; 
compression may be provided
I Even 2G CDPD and Mobitex
Data-Only technologies are slow!
I 3G technologies are much better!
• Much faster RF traffic 
channels
• True packet-switched channel 
management

ITU Third Generation Process
Phases and Terminology
I The ITU defined objectives for next-generation mobile systems in a 1998 
request for proposals
I Sponsoring organizations submitted details of proposed radio 
transmission technologies in mid-1998
I Technology developers were inflexible and could not reach compromises 
to select one common proposal
I The system operators led the process of “harmonizing” the proposals in to 
three main versions for commercial deployment, “Global Third Generation”

Contrasting US/International CDMA 
Viewpoints
I Should we have one worldwide 3G standard?
• Great idea, but is anybody willing to compromise?
I North American IS-95 CDMA perspective
• New chip rate should be a multiple of our current rate so 2G-
3G signals will be synchronous and can be overlaid
• Channel structure, system architecture should be logical 
extension of our existing IS-95 technology
I International CDMA perspective
• New signal should be a logical extension of existing GSM 
system architecture, the GSM-MAP specification
– Logical extension of GPRS (General Packet Radio 
Service)
• Fear of depending on US-based GPS system for timing
– A military system, may be withdrawn during conflicts

Further Harmonization Work
I cdmaONE systems have been structured around the IS-41-based 
HLR and VLR paradigm for intersystem handoff and call delivery
I IS-2000 CDMA systems will be further harmonized to achieve 
operability on the GSM-MAP (Group Speciale Mobile Mobile 
Application Part), the network architecture of GSM
• Protocol stacks of both IS-2000 and UMTS have been largely 
harmonized already

2G CDMA Beginnings: IS-95A and J-Std 008
I Original commercial CDMA systems in the 800 MHz. band 
complied with IS-95A, and 1900 MHz. Systems complied with the 
Joint Standard 008.  Both had the following common features
I Signal structure:
• 1.2288 MCPS spreading, signal ∼1.25 MHz. Wide
• BTS Sectors have short PN offsets, channels are Walsh codes
• Mobiles have long PN offsets and transmit one channel only
I Traffic Channel Capabilities:
• Rate Set 1: 9600-bps traffic channels for 8 kb/s vocoders
• Rate Set 2: 14400-bps traffic channels for 13 kb/s vocoders 
and other 14400-max data applications

IS-95B: CDMA 2G Enhancements
I IS-95B is still considered Second Generation, but offers some needed 
enhancements to the original IS-95A and J-Std008
I Improved Access Methods
• Mobiles originally could use only one sector during an access attempt
– Multipath fading causes roughly 2% failed accesses!
• IS-95B allows mobiles to use alternate sectors as “backup” during 
access in case the original sector fades
I Improved Handoff Methods
• Original CDMA provided only fixed-threshold handoff triggers
– Inflexible, can skip needed handoffs but waste unneeded ones
• IS-95B uses slope and intercept-based thresholds to tailor handoff 
action to what is really needed for call survival
I Faster Data Services
• Original CDMA allowed data only at the rate of a single traffic channel
• IS-95B/IS-707 allows aggregation of traffic channels for faster data, 
but not at the rates provided by 3G cdma2000

I 1xRTT Keeps same chip rate and carrier 
bandwidth
I Splits I and Q phase planes, 2x cap!
I Keep existing IS-95-based channels for 
backwards compatibility with IS-95 mobiles
• IS-95B enhancements retained
I Adds new radio configurations, adds new 
FWD and REV channels
• New optional control channels
• New fundamental traffic channels
• New supplemental traffic channels for

3G Phase Two:  cdma2000 1xRTT to 3xRTT
I Forward link expanded to 3 carriers, 
each 1.2288 MCPS for 1.25 MHz. BW
• Active walsh codes are not 
duplicated on the carriers so they 
maintain orthogonality and share 
capacity as traffic loading changes
I Reverse link expands to 3x current 
chip rate, 3.6864 MCPS, fits in 5 MHz.
I Adds new radio configurations and new 
supplemental channels faster than 
possible in 1xRTT
I Increased spreading rate requires new 
reverse short codes, other refinements

3G Phase Two Alternatives: 1xEV
I 1x alternatives are available offering data rates just as fast as 3x!
• 1xEV - 1x EVolution - is the term used to describe them
I Qualcomm’s proprietary HDR (High Data Rates) technology dedicates a 
1x carrier for fast data use only - no voice.
• This is called 1xEV DO (Data Only)
I Motorola and Nokia have teamed up to develop and promote an 
alternative 1x technology under the trade name 1Xtreme
• Uses more complex modulation techniques
• offers up to 4.9 Mb/s data rates
• backwards compatible with voice and data on same carrier
• This is called 1xEV DV (Data and Voice)
I Both 1xEV DO and 1xEV DV use fragile modulation schemes
• Maximum claimed rates will be available only under ideal conditions 
(near unloaded base stations)
• 1xEV development is continuing - deployment probable in late 2002
I Despite drawbacks, 1xEV is still more attractive to operators than 3x
• 3xRTT requires three physical carriers and substantially more BTS 
equipment than 1xEV!

GSM History
I The GSM network architecture was defined in work of the ETSI 
during the late 1980s
• Switching and network architecture based on ISDN concepts
• Roaming and location management derived from early 
Intelligent Networks concepts
I GSM has enjoyed large business success due to its non-
proprietary open architecture and competitive vendors
• Approximately 60% of global wireless subscribers use GSM

ETSI GSM Adopts W-CDMA!
I One of the most significant developments in the entire 3G evolution is the 
decision by the large GSM community to adopt a wideband CDMA 
technology as its 3G migration choice
I The 3G plane of capabilities is called the Universal Mobile 
Telecommunications Services (UMTS)
I The new WCDMA radio interface to support UMTS is called the UMTS 
Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA). There are two versions:
• FDD Frequency Division Duplex: similar to CDMA2000, BTS 
transmission and mobile transmission in separate paired bands
• TDD Time Division Duplex puts BTS and mobile on same frequencies
taking turns transmitting bursts to each other
– May be useful to operators without much spectrum
– Large propagation delays can reduce capacity, so TDD is most 
effective in small-tier environments (indoors, etc.)
– TDD can provide 2-Mb/s data rates in controlled fixed 
environments
I UMTS UTRA FDD is the primary high-tier mode intended to be used by 
most UTRA operators

GSM 3G Migration: Radio and Network
I The GSM community is making the transition to 3G in three distinct 
phases
• Phase 1 adds a packet-switched radio network as an overlay 
on the existing physical structure
• Phase 2 replaces base stations and controllers with the new 
UTRA sub-network
• Phase 3 is completed by introducing UMTS handsets and their 
corresponding UMTS Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs)
• Core functionality of the existing network is maintained 
throughout the three phases of migration

Phase 1: GPRS General Packet Radio Service
I GPRS uses aggregated timeslots of existing GSM base stations to 
transmit packet data
• IP routers (SGSN Serving GPRS Support Nodes and GGSN
Gateway GPRS Support Nodes) forward IP packets to users
• Users perceive a continuous connection using/browsing, even 
though packets are exchanged intermittently and no steady 
connection exists
• GPRS supports 9.06, 13.4, 15.6, and 21.4 kb/s per GSM timeslot 
and total rates of 40-60 kb/s and more are possible as multiple 
timeslots are aggregated on demand
I Each BSC has a parallel PCU Packet Controller Unit which manages
all packet streams
I GPRS provides IP capability in the near term, well in advance of the 
higher bandwidths possible on fully-implemented UMTS systems

EDGE: Shortcut to Fast Data or Unneeded 
Detour on the Road to UMTS?
I Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution is a speed-enhancing 
modulation upgrade for data transmission and has variants for 
both GSM-GPRS systems and for US TDMA IS-136 systems.
• EDGE uses Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) and 8-
phase Phase Shift Keying (8-PSK) to allow 144kb/s bit rates for 
mobile users and 384kb/s for pedestrian users
I With unsynchronized base stations, a GSM network can be 
upgraded to EDGE in only 2.4 MHz. of spectrum
• This can be lowered to 600 KHz. If the BTS are synchronized 
to prevent overtransmission during terminal assignment
I EDGE interest has fluctuated and many GSM and TDMA 
operators have chosen not to pursue it, believing it is more efficient 
to move directly to UMTS.  This has led several manufacturers to
stop their EDGE development activities

Introduction to Third Generation Wireless v1.58 (c)2002 Scott Baxter
UTRA WCDMA Coding
I Like other deployed CDMA systems, UMTS UTRA WCDMA builds signals
from individual channels, applying spreading in two steps
• A channelization code is applied
– This determines the bandwidth of the signal and the final 
spreading gain
• A scrambling code is applied
– This distinguishes different mobiles at the base station receiver, 
and different base stations at the mobile receiver
I UMTS channelization codes are variable length orthogonal codes, similar 
in function to the Walsh codes used in IS-95
I UMTS scrambling codes are different Gold sequences 218 long
• Each sector in a cluster has a different Gold code and all are 
transmitted synchronously
I UMTS frames are 10 ms. long and the longer codes are truncated to this 
length
I The use of a smaller set of known codes allows some fancy mathematical 
tricks in decoding, advanced receiver algorithms which can improve the 
reverse link quality

UMTS UTRA Compatibility with GSM
I In addition to using the GSM-MAP network architecture, UMTS 
systems have been carefully specified to ease the tasks of dual-
mode GSM/WCDMA mobiles
I The superframe structures are compatible
• Frame timing is 10 ms. 
• Dual-mode mobiles can conduct GSM MAHO measurements 
due to the comparable timing structures

UWC-136: The TDMA Modes
I IS-54 and IS-136 operators have steadily refined and exploited 
narrowband TDMA technology for almost ten years
• No spreading techniques are used!
• However, the narrowband channel structure does not offer any 
simple ways to provide compatible high-bandwidth service
• Several alternative modes have been investigated:
I 136HS Outdoor, also called EGPRS-136
• Very similar to EDGE as deployed in GSM systems
• Uses same network architecture as GPRS
I 136HS Indoor, sometimes called W-TDMA:
• 1.6 MHz. Wideband carrier with adaptive modulation and rapid 
bursts
• High data rates use bursts 1/16 the length of 4.615 ms frames
• Medium data rates use bursts 1/64 the length of 4.615 ms

EDGE is down…..but is it out?
I AT&T wireless systems has chosen GPRS and ultimately UMTS
I No GSM-community users seem to be pushing EDGE
I No major champions for EDGE in the manufacturers or operators’ 
communities
I Some major network manufacturers have discontinued their EDGE 
development activities

I CDMA2000
• 1xRTT: Nominal channel spacing and width of 1.25 MHz.
– 1xRTT uses one or many 1.25 MHz. Carriers
• 3xRTT: one complete constellation fits within 5 MHz. 
– 3  1.25 MHz. 1x channels contain the forward link
– 1  3.68 MHz. 3x channel contains the reverse link
I UMTS
• W-CDMA channels with a nominal spacing of 5 MHz. 
– Center frequencies are specified with resolution of 200 
kHz., as in GSM

Who Needs More Spectrum for 3G?
I 900 MHz. GSM operators generally do not have 5 MHz. available 
and must seek additional spectrum
• UMTS cannot overlay spectrum already in use for GSM/GPRS
• Most operators do not have 5 MHz. available to clear in current 
licensed blocks
I 1800 MHz./1900 MHz. GSM operators are more likely to have as 
much as 5 MHz. Available and clear for new UMTS carriers
I 800 MHz. US cellular operators
• If deploying UMTS, must have new spectrum - won’t fit at 800
• If deploying CDMA2000, can usually overlay with existing IS-95
I 1900 MHz. US PCS operators
• If deploying CDMA2000, can usually overlay with existing IS-95
• If deploying UMTS over GSM, D E and F block operators will 
need additional spectrum
