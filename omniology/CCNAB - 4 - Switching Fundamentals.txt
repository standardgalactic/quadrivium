Overview  
53 
Switching is a technology that decreases congestion in local-area networks (LANs) 
54 
by reducing traffic and increasing bandwidth.  
55 
 
56 
This module discusses problems in a LAN and possible solutions that can improve 
57 
LAN performance. You will learn about LAN congestion and its effect on network 
58 
performance and the advantages of LAN segmentation in a network. In addition, 
59 
you will learn about the advantages and disadvantages of using bridges, switches, 
60 
and routers for LAN segmentation and the effects of switching, bridging, and 
61 
routing on network throughput. Finally, you will learn about VLANs and the 
62 
benefits of VLANs.

4.1.1 Early Local-Area Networks 
117 
Figure 1: Early Local-Area Networks   
118 
 
119 
 
120 
The earliest local-area network (LAN) technologies that were installed widely were 
121 
either thick Ethernet or thin Ethernet infrastructures. It's important to understand 
122 
some of the limitations of these infrastructures to see where LAN switching stands 
123 
today. Thick Ethernet installations had some important limitations, such as distance, 
124 
for example. Early thick Ethernet networks were limited to only 500 meters before 
125 
the signal degraded. For distances beyond 500 meters, repeaters were required to 
126 
boost and amplify that signal. 
127 
 
128 
There were also limitations on the number of stations and servers on a network, as 
129 
well as the placement of those workstations on the network. The cable itself was 
130 
relatively expensive, and it was large in diameter, making it difficult to install 
131 
throughout the building because it was pulled through the walls and ceilings. 
132 
Adding new users was relatively simple—a nonintrusive tap plugged in a new 
133 
station anywhere along the cable. The thick Ethernet network provided a capacity of 
134 
10 megabits per second (Mbps), but this bandwidth was shared, meaning that 10 Mb 
135 
was shared among all users on a given segment. 
136 
 
137 
A slight improvement to thick Ethernet was thin Ethernet technology, commonly 
138 
referred to as cheaper net. This technology was less expensive, and it required less 
139 
space in terms of installation than thick Ethernet because it was thinner in diameter, 
140 
hence the name. It was still relatively challenging to install, though, because it 
141 
sometimes required a home run, or a direct run from a workstation back to a hub or 
142 
concentrator. Adding users required a momentary interruption in the network, 
143 
because a cable segment had to be broken in order to add a new server or 
144 
workstation.  
145 
Practice 
146

4.1.2 Hubs 
154 
Figure 1: Hub Addressed Many of These Problems  
155 
 
156 
 
157 
Adding hubs or concentrators into the network offered an improvement on thin and 
158 
thick Ethernet technology. Hubs are sometimes referred to as Ethernet concentrators 
159 
or Ethernet repeaters; they are basically self-contained Ethernet segments within a 
160 
box. Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling was used, but the fundamental 
161 
limitation of a shared technology remained. As you can see in Figure [1], Ethernet is 
162 
fundamentally a shared technology—all users of a given LAN segment “fight” for 
163 
the same amount of bandwidth. This situation is analogous to cars all trying to get 
164 
onto the freeway at once. In the network, even though each device has its own cable 
165 
segment that connects into the hub, they all share the same fixed amount of 
166 
bandwidth. Frames, or packets, in a network all vie for bandwidth.  
167 
 
168 
Although physically it looks like all users have their own segment to their 
169 
workstation, they are all interconnected inside the hub, so the hub is still a shared 
170 
Ethernet technology. Also, these devices are passive, meaning that they're virtually 
171 
transparent to the end users—the end users don't even know that they exist. In 
172 
addition, the devices have no role in terms of a forwarding decision in the network, 
173 
nor do they provide any segmentation within the network because they work at 
174 
Layer 1 in the OSI framework.  
175 
Practice 
176

4.1.3 Collisions 
183 
Figure 1: Collisions: Telltale Signs  
184 
 
185 
 
186 
Collisions are by-products of an Ethernet network. In an Ethernet network, many 
187 
stations share the same segment, so any one of these stations can transmit at any 
188 
given time. If two or more stations try to transmit at the same time, a collision 
189 
results, indicating that the network is becoming too congested or that too many 
190 
users are on the same segment. 
191 
 
192 
When the number of collisions in the network becomes excessive, sluggish network 
193 
response times result; an increasing number of user complaints reported to the 
194 
network manager is a good indication that the network is sluggish. 
195 
Practice 
196 
1. If two or more station on a network try to transmit simultaneously, what is this

4.1.4 Transmission Ways 
204 
Figure 1: Other Bandwidth Consumers  
205 
 
206 
 
207 
It's also important to understand fundamentally how transmissions can occur in the 
208 
network. Communication in a network occurs in three ways. The most common way 
209 
is by unicast transmissions. In a unicast transmission, one transmitter tries to reach 
210 
one receiver. This form of communication is by far the most common form of 
211 
communication in a network. 
212 
 
213 
Another way to communicate is by broadcasting, when one transmitter tries to 
214 
reach all receivers in the network. As you can see in Figure [1], the server station is 
215 
sending out one message and it is being received by everyone on that segment.  
216 
 
217 
The last mechanism is known as a multicast, when one transmitter tries to reach not 
218 
everyone, but a subset or a group of the entire segment. As shown in Figure [1], two 
219 
stations are reached, but one of them doesn’t need to participate, so it is not in the 
220 
multicast group. 
221 
Practice 
222 
1. Which of the following is not a common way of transmission in a network?

233 
Hubs were introduced into the network as a better way to scale thin and thick 
234 
Ethernet networks. It's important to remember, though, that these are still shared 
235 
Ethernet networks, even though hubs are used. Each individual workstation or 
236 
server in the network has an individual desktop connection, allowing centralization 
237 
of all cabling back to a wiring closet. This setup makes adds, moves, and changes 
238 
easier because cables can just be moved around in the wiring closet. (Later we show 
239 
that adds, moves, and changes are even easier with LAN switching.) 
240 
 
241 
In a hub- or concentrator- based network, workgroups are determined simply by the 
242 
physical hub plugged into. (Again LAN switching makes configuration for 
243 
workgroups even easier.)

255 
 
256 
Segmentation is used to scale networks. One way to scale hub-based networks is to 
257 
add routers; another is to add bridges, which provide a certain level of segmentation 
258 
by adding a certain amount of intelligence into the network.   
259 
 
260 
Bridges operate at Layer 2, whereas hubs operate at Layer 1. Operating at Layer 2 
261 
offers more intelligence for making forwarding decisions. Bridges are more 
262 
intelligent than hubs because they can actually listen in, or “eavesdrop” on the 
263 
traffic going through—they can look at source and destination addresses, and they 
264 
can build a table that enables them to make intelligent forwarding decisions. They 
265 
actually collect and pass frames between two network segments while at the same 
266 
time making intelligent forwarding decisions. As a result, brides can provide greater 
267 
control of the traffic within a network.

4.1.7 Switches—Layer 2 
276 
Figure 1: Switches—Layer 2  
277 
 
278 
 
279 
Switches provide even better control, at least at Layer 2. As you can see in Figure 
280 
[1], we've improved the model of traffic going through the network. Returning to the 
281 
traffic analogy, we have actually subdivided the main highway so that each car has 
282 
its own lane to drive on through the network. And fundamentally, this functionality 
283 
can be provided in data networks as well. 
284 
 
285 
Each station has its own cable into the network—analogous to each workstation 
286 
having its own “lane” through the “highway.” Then with functionality known as 
287 
microsegmentation, each workstation gets its own dedicated segment through the 
288 
network. Microsegmentation enables the travel of multiple, simultaneous 
289 
conversations through the switch at any given time. Hubs and bridges offer only 
290 
limited numbers of simultaneous conversations at a time. 
291 
 
292 
Remember that if two stations try to communicate in a hubbed environment, 
293 
collisions result. In a switched environment, however, collisions don’t occur 
294 
because each workstation has its own dedicated path through the network. The 
295 
network actually has dramatically more bandwidth, and each station now has a 
296 
dedicated 10-Mbps worth of bandwidth. 
297

4.1.9 Typical Causes of Network Congestion 
321 
Figure 1: Typical Causes of Network Congestion  
322 
 
323 
 
324 
How do congestion problems manifest themselves in a network? Remember that 
325 
shared LAN segments have a fixed amount of bandwidth. As users are added, 
326 
proportionally, the amount of bandwidth per user decreases, and the result is 
327 
collisions—and, of course, collisions reduce performance. 
328 
  
329 
Now consider the newer technologies used in workstations. With early LAN 
330 
technologies, workstations were relatively limited in terms of the amount of traffic 
331 
they could deliver to the network. But with newer, faster CPUs, faster buses, faster 
332 
peripherals, and so on, it is much easier for a single workstation to fill up a network 
333 
segment. So with faster PCs, applications can be used to better advantage—at the 
334 
expense of reduced available bandwidth. 
335 
 
336 
In particular, bandwidth-intensive applications that are used today, such as desktop 
337 
publishing, engineering applications, imaging applications, and even multimedia 
338 
applications, deplete available bandwidth faster than ever. 
339 
Practice 
340 
1. Which of the following is not a cause of network congestion?

342

351 
Switched infrastructures are the most commonly implemented LANs today. Because 
352 
of the price point of deploying switches, many companies are bypassing the shared-
353 
hub technologies and moving directly to switches. Even within switched networks, 
354 
at some point routers are needed to provide scalability. In addition, grouping of 
355 
users is largely determined by physical location. 
356 
 
357 
Thus we have seen the limitations of traditional shared LAN technologies. Now 
358 
let’s see how we can improve performance in some of these areas. Consider 
359

I 
The earliest LAN technologies that were installed widely were either thick 
376 
Ethernet or thin Ethernet infrastructures. 
377 
I 
Hubs are also known as Ethernet concentrators or Ethernet repeaters. Hubs 
378 
are Layer 1 device. 
379 
I 
When one or two nodes on a Ethernet network try to send data at the same 
380 
time, a collision happens. 
381 
I 
There are three common transmission ways: unicast, broadcast, and 
382 
multicast transmission. 
383 
I 
In a hub-based LAN, all resources are shared. 
384 
I 
Bridges operate at Layer 2. Bridges use MAC addresses to filter traffic pass 
385 
to it. 
386 
I 
Switches are Layer 2 devices. A switch segments a LAN into 
387 
microsegments.  
388

Some of the typical causes of network congestions are too many users, too

Again, LAN switching provides microsegmentation, which gives dedicated 
427 
bandwidth to each user on the network. Microsegmentation eliminates collisions in 
428 
a network, and effectively increases the capacity for each station connected to the 
429 
network. It also supports multiple, simultaneous conversations at any given time, 
430 
resulting in dramatic improvement in available bandwidth and scalability.

Figure 5: LAN Switch Operation 
459 
 
460 
 
461 
Now let’s look at the fundamental operation of a LAN switch. As indicated in 
462 
Figure [1], some data needs to be transmitted from Station A to Station B. 
463 
Remember that as this traffic goes through the network, the switch operates at Layer 
464 
2, meaning that the switch can look at the Media Access Control (MAC)-layer 
465 
address. The switch actually looks at the traffic as it goes through to discover the 
466 
MAC address and store it in an address table (see Figure [2]). 
467 
 
468 
So, as the traffic goes through, an entry is made in this table in terms of station and 
469 
the port that it's connected to on the switch. 
470 
 
471 
When that frame of data is in the switch, it floods to all ports because the 
472 
destination station is unknown. After the address entry is made in the table, 
473 
however, a response comes back from Station B to Station A, and now the switch 
474 
knows where Station A is connected to the network (see Figure [3]). 
475 
  
476 
So the data is transmitted into the switch, but notice that the switch doesn't flood the 
477 
traffic this time—it sends the data out only port 3, because it knows where Station A 
478 
is on the network (see Figures [4] and [5]). The original transmission indicated 
479 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 4: Switching Fundamentals 4-21 
where that MAC address came from, allowing the switch to more efficiently deliver 
480 
traffic in the network. As noted previously, the fundamental concept behind LAN 
481 
switching is called microsegmentation, and it allows multiple, simultaneous 
482 
conversations in the network. 
483 
Practice 
484 
1. Which of the following is used by LAN switches for making the forwarding 
485 
decision?

4.2.3 Switching Technology: Full Duplex 
494 
Figure 1: Switching Technology: Full Duplex  
495 
 
496 
 
497 
Another concept of LAN switching that dramatically improves scalability is full-
498 
duplex transmission, which effectively doubles the amount of bandwidth between 
499 
nodes. This feature can be important, for example, between high-bandwidth 
500 
consumers such as between a switch and a server connection.  It provides essentially 
501 
collision-free transmissions in the network. In 10-Mbps connections, for example, it 
502 
effectively provides 10 Mb of transmit capacity and 10 Mb of receive capacity, for 
503 
effectively 20 Mb of capacity on a single connection. Likewise, a 100-Mbps 
504 
connection offers effectively 200 Mbps of throughput. 
505 
Practice 
506 
1. Which of the following is a feature of full-duplex transmission?

■ Doubles bandwidth between nodes

4.2.4 Switching Technology: Two Methods 
514 
Figure 1: Switching Technology: Two Methods  
515 
 
516 
 
517 
There are two modes of switching, offering different performance and latency. 
518 
(Note: Latency, sometimes called propagation delay, is the time a frame, or packet, 
519 
of data takes to travel from the source station or node to its final destination on the 
520 
network.)  
521 
 
522 
First, in cut-through switching, the switch reads the destination MAC address as the 
523 
traffic flows through the switch and  “cuts through” to its destination without 
524 
continuing to read the rest of the frame. Cut-through switching offers better 
525 
performance than the second method, known as store and forward.   
526 
 
527 
In store-and-forward switching, the switch reads the entire frame of data, decides 
528 
where it needs to go, and sends it on its way.  The obvious trade-off here is the 
529 
longer time it takes the switch to read the entire frame. As it reads the entire frame, 
530 
however, it performs some error correction on that frame, possibly increasing 
531 
reliability. In summary, although cut-through switching is faster, it offers no error 
532 
detection.  
533 
Practice 
534 
1. The two types of switching methods are ____________ and _______________. 
535 
 
536 
 
537 
538 
■ Cut-through 
- Switch checks destination 
address and immediately 
begins forwarding frame 
■ 
Store and forward 
- Complete frame is 
received before forwarding

541 
Figure 2: 802.1d Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP)  
542 
 
543 
 
544 
Now let's look at some key technologies within LAN switching. In large networks, 
545 
one of the problems at Layer 2 in the OSI model is that if forwarding decisions are 
546 
made only at this layer, the network cannot have any physical layer loops. 
547 
 
548 
Thus in a simple network, as we see in Figure [1], when a switch has any multicast, 
549 
broadcast, or any unknown traffic, the result will be storms of traffic being looped 
550 
endlessly through the network. To prevent this situation, loops need to be 
551 
eliminated. One way to eliminate the loops would be to physically disconnect those 
552 
segments, but that is obviously not a good solution because there would be no 
553 
physical redundancy in the network. Thus what is needed is a way to logically cut 
554 
out the loops in the network so that they can be reenabled dynamically if necessary. 
555 
 
556 
802.1d Spanning-Tree   
557 
The solution is the Spanning-Tree Protocol, or STP.  STP is actually an industry 
558 
standard defined by the IEEE standards committee, known as the 802.1d Spanning-
559 
Tree Protocol. STP allows physical redundancy in the network, but it logically 
560 
disconnects those loops. 
561 
 
562 
(bridge protocol data units) 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 4: Switching Fundamentals 4-25 
It's important to understand that logically disconnecting the loops allows dynamic 
563 
reestablishment of a connection if a failure occurs within the network. Switches and 
564 
bridges can disconnect loops simply by communicating back and forth with hello 
565 
messages. Hello messages are status messages that the bridges and switches 
566 
exchange periodically so they know the status of those logical connections and 
567 
disconnections. If a switch or bridge stops hearing a given communication from a 
568 
certain device on the network, that network device has failed. And when a network 
569 
failure occurs, the link must be reestablished in order to maintain redundancy. 
570 
Technically, these little exchanges are known as bridge protocol data units, or 
571 
BPDUs. 
572 
 
573 
Although STP works well, it can take from 30 seconds to a full minute for the 
574 
network to fully converge—in order for all devices to know the status of the 
575 
network.  
576

4.3.1 Layer 2 Switching Devices 
617 
Figure 1: Layer 2 Switching 
618 
 
619 
 
620 
A Layer 2 switch is operationally similar to a multiport bridge, but has a much 
621 
higher capacity and supports many new features, such as full-duplex operation. A 
622 
Layer 2 LAN switch performs switching and filtering based on the OSI data link 
623 
layer (Layer 2) MAC address. Like bridges, Layer 2 switches are completely 
624 
transparent to network protocols and user applications. 
625 
 
626 
Bridges and switches analyze incoming frames, make forwarding decisions based on 
627 
information contained in the frames, and forward the frames toward the destination. 
628 
Upper-layer protocol transparency is a primary advantage of both bridging and 
629 
switching. Because both device types operate at the data link layer, they are not 
630 
required to examine upper-layer information. Bridges are also capable of filtering 
631 
frames based on any Layer 2 fields.  
632 
 
633 
Although bridges and switches share most relevant attributes, several distinctions 
634 
differentiate these technologies. Switches are significantly faster because they 
635 
switch in hardware. Switches also can support higher port densities than bridges. 
636 
And, some switches support cut-through switching, reducing latency and delays in 
637 
the network, whereas bridges support only store-and-forward traffic switching. The 
638 
primary differences, though, are that bridges perform switching via software (as 
639 
opposed to hardware) and switches have a higher port density. 
640 
 
641 
Layer 2 switching is basically hardware-based bridging. In a switch, frame 
642 
forwarding is handled by specialized hardware called application-specific integrated 
643 
circuits (ASICs). The ASIC technology engineered for switches allows for 
644 
scalability up to gigabit speeds, with low latency at costs significantly lower than 
645 
Ethernet bridges. 
646 
 
647 
Layer 2 switches provide network managers with the ability to increase bandwidth 
648 
without adding complexity to the network. Layer 2 data frames consist of both 
649 
control information, such as MAC addresses, and end-user content. At Layer 2, no 
650 
modification of the frame control information is required when moving between 
651 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 4: Switching Fundamentals 4-29 
similar Layer 1 interfaces, such as Ethernet and Fast Ethernet. However, changes to 
652 
control information may occur when bridging between unlike LAN types such as 
653 
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) or ATM and Ethernet.  
654 
 
655 
Workgroup connectivity and network segmentation are the two primary uses for 
656 
Layer 2 switches. The high performance of a Layer 2 switch allows for network 
657 
designs that significantly decrease the number of hosts per physical segment. 
658 
Decreasing the number of hosts per segment leads to a flatter design with more 
659 
segments in the campus network. However, despite the advantages of Layer 2 
660 
switching, it still has all the same characteristics and limitations of legacy bridging.

4.3.2 Layer 3 Switching Devices 
677 
Figure 1: Layer 3 Switching  
678 
 
679 
 
680 
Layer 3 switches are, essentially, a cross between a LAN switch and a router. Each 
681 
port on the switch is a separate LAN port, but the forwarding engine actually 
682 
calculates and stores routes based on IP addresses, not MAC addresses. You can 
683 
think of a Layer 3 switch as a switch that also performs hardware-based routing 
684 
using Layer 3 (network) addresses. 
685 
 
686 
Layer 3 switches available today tend to support only IP or both IP and Internetwork 
687 
Packet Exchange (IPX), to the exclusion of other network layer protocols. Similarly, 
688 
selection of LAN port technologies is frequently limited to 10-, 100-, or 1000- Mbps 
689 
Ethernet. 
690 
 
691 
Basically, Layer 3 switching is hardware-based routing. In particular, the packet 
692 
forwarding is handled by specialized hardware ASICs. The goal is to capture the 
693 
speed of switching and the scalability of routing. A Layer 3 switch acts on a packet 
694 
in the same way that a traditional router does; for example:

The primary difference between the packet-switching operation of a router and a 
704 
Layer 3 switch lies in the physical implementation. In general-purpose routers, 
705 
microprocessor-based engines typically perform software-based packet switching. A 
706 
Layer 3 switch performs packet switching with hardware. Because it is designed to 
707 
handle high-performance LAN traffic, a Layer 3 switch can be placed anywhere 
708 
within the network, offering a cost-effective alternative to the traditional router.

4.3.3 Layer 4 Switching Devices 
728 
Figure 1: Layer 4 Switching  
729 
 
730 
 
731 
Layer 4 switching refers to Layer 3 hardware-based routing that accounts for Layer 
732 
4 control information. Information in packet headers typically includes Layer 3 
733 
addressing, the Layer 3 protocol type, and more fields relevant to Layer 3 devices, 
734 
such as Time To Live (TTL) and checksum. The packet also contains information 
735 
relevant to the higher layers within the communicating hosts, such as the protocol 
736 
type and port number.  
737 
 
738 
A simple definition of Layer 4 switching is the ability to make forwarding decisions 
739 
based not just on the MAC address or source/destination IP addresses, but on Layer 
740 
4 parameters such as port numbers as well. In TCP or User Datagram Protocol 
741 
(UDP) flows, the application is encoded as a port number in the TCP or UDP 
742 
header. 
743 
 
744 
Routers are capable of controlling traffic based on Layer 4 information. One method 
745 
of controlling Layer 4 traffic is by using extended access lists. Another method of 
746 
providing Layer 4 accounting of flows is available, NetFlow Switching, which is 
747 
utilized on the Cisco 7200 and 7500 Router platforms. 
748 
 
749 
Finally, when performing Layer 4 functions, a switch reads the TCP and UDP fields 
750 
within the headers to determine what type of information the packet is carrying. The 
751 
network manager can program the switch to prioritize traffic by application. This 
752 
function allows network managers to define a quality of service (QoS) for end users. 
753 
When used for QoS purposes, Layer 4 switching might mean that a 
754 
videoconferencing application is granted more bandwidth than an e-mail message or 
755 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) packet. 
756 
 
757 
Layer 4 switching is necessary if your policy dictates granular control of traffic by 
758 
application or if you require accounting of traffic itemized in terms of applications. 
759 
However, it should be noted that switches performing Layer 4 switching need the 
760 
ability to identify and store large numbers of forwarding-table entries, especially if 
761 
the switch is within the core of an enterprise network. Many Layer 2 and Layer 3 
762 
switches have forwarding tables that are sized in proportion to the number of 
763 
network devices. 
764 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 4: Switching Fundamentals 4-33 
 
765 
With Layer 4 switches, the number of network devices must be multiplied by the 
766 
number of different application protocols and conversations in use in the network. 
767 
Thus, the size of the forwarding table can grow quickly as the numbers of end 
768 
devices and types of applications increase. This large table capacity is essential to 
769 
creating a high-performance switch that supports wire-speed Layer 4 forwarding of 
770 
traffic.

4.4.1 Constraints of Shared LANs 
823 
Figure 1: Constraints of Shared LANs  
824 
 
825 
 
826 
Let's begin by reviewing some of the limitations of traditional, shared local-area 
827 
networks. Users are generally bound by their physical location in a network; that is, 
828 
the actual port or hub that they plug into determines what resources they can 
829 
connect to and how they're grouped together in a LAN. Also, users are generally 
830 
grouped not logically, but physically by where they sit and where they gain their 
831 
physical connectivity. 
832 
 
833 
Shared LAN networks also offer very little security, because on a hub or 
834 
concentrator all traffic in the network is available on all ports. That's the inherent 
835 
nature of shared LAN devices. Also, there are constraints with addressing because 
836 
of the physical layout and requirements in the shared technology environment, and 
837 
moves, adds, and changes can be very difficult as well because they require making 
838 
changes either on a patch panel or in a wiring closet—wherever the hubs or 
839 
concentrators reside.  
840 
 
841 
Lastly, routers are needed to connect different segments together. So if separation 
842 
occurs, router ports either may not be available, or if they are, they're relatively 
843 
expensive compared to some of the alternatives. These are some of the reasons that 
844 
virtual LANs, or VLANs, are implemented. 
845 
■ Users are physically 
bound. 
■ Subnets are tied to hubs.
■ Users are grouped by 
location. 
■ Segment has no security.
■ Addressing is 
constrained. 
■ Moves require address 
changes. 
■ Router ports are 
expensive.

861 
A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logical grouping of devices or users, as shown in 
862 
Figure [1]. These devices or users can be grouped by function, department, or 
863 
application, regardless of their physical segment location. VLAN configuration is 
864 
done at the switch via software. VLANs are not standardized and require the use of 
865 
proprietary software from the switch vendor.  
866 
 
867 
As mentioned in previous section, a typical shared LAN is configured according to 
868 
the physical infrastructure it is connecting. Users are grouped based on their 
869 
■ A switch creates a 
broadcast domain. 
■ VLANs help manage 
broadcast domains. 
■ VLANs can be defined 
on port groups, users, 
or protocols. 
■ LAN switches and 
network management 
software provide a 
mechanism to create 
VLANs.

Module 4: Switching Fundamentals 4-39 
location in relation to the hub they are plugged in to and how the cable is run to the 
870 
wiring closet. The router interconnecting each shared hub typically provides 
871 
segmentation and can act as a broadcast firewall. The segments created by switches 
872 
do not. Traditional LAN segmentation does not group users according to their 
873 
workgroup association or need for bandwidth. Therefore, they share the same 
874 
segment and contend for the same bandwidth, although the bandwidth requirements 
875 
may vary greatly by workgroup or department.  
876 
 
877 
VLANs take a single broadcast domain and limit it within a given switch so that 
878 
multiple segments can exist within a switch instead of one device providing a single 
879 
broadcast domain. VLANs also can help manage broadcast traffic. Because the 
880 
switch itself without VLANs propagates all broadcast traffic, as soon as multiple 
881 
VLANs are created, they will block the propagation of that broadcast traffic. Thus 
882 
VLANs can help contain broadcast traffic. In addition, VLANs can be defined by 
883 
port groups, by actual user IDs, by MAC address, or even by protocol. VLAN group 
884 
membership can be defined in several ways. Lastly, LAN switches and network 
885 
management software provide a mechanism to actually create, and more 
886 
importantly, to manage VLANs over the long term (see Figure [2]).

4.4.3 Remove the Physical Boundaries 
897 
Figure 1: Remove the Physical Boundaries 
898 
 
899 
 
900 
Conceptually, VLANs provide greater segmentation and organizational flexibility. 
901 
VLAN technology allows you to group switch ports and the users connected to them 
902 
into logically defined communities of interest. These groupings can be coworkers 
903 
within the same department, a cross-functional product team, or diverse users 
904 
sharing the same network application or software. 
905 
 
906 
Grouping these ports and users into communities of interest—referred to as VLAN 
907 
organizations—can be accomplished within a single switch, or more powerfully, 
908 
between connected switches within the enterprise. By grouping ports and users 
909 
together across multiple switches, VLANs can span single building infrastructures 
910 
or interconnected buildings. As shown in Figure [1], VLANs completely remove the 
911 
physical constraints of workgroup communications across the enterprise.  
912 
 
913 
Additionally, the role of the router evolves beyond the more traditional role of 
914 
firewalls and broadcast suppression to policy-based control, broadcast management, 
915 
and route processing and distribution. Equally as important, routers remain vital for 
916 
switched architectures configured as VLANs because they provide the 
917 
communication between logically defined workgroups (VLANs). Routers also 
918 
provide VLAN access to shared resources such as servers and hosts, and connect to 
919 
other parts of the network that are either logically segmented with the more 
920 
traditional subnet approach or require access to remote sites across wide-area links. 
921 
Layer 3 communication, either embedded in the switch or provided externally, is an 
922 
integral part of any high-performance switching architecture.

4.4.4 VLAN Benefits 
932 
Figure 1: VLAN Benefits 
933 
 
934 
 
935 
Some of the key benefits of using VLANs are given in Figure [1]. The original 
936 
motivation for VLANs was to reduce the administrative costs associated with 
937 
managing a routine shared network. What was needed was a way to simplify the 
938 
moves, adds, and changes that were commonly associated with most organizations 
939 
as their networks evolved. VLANs offer other benefits, including better bandwidth 
940 
control. Segmenting a switch and into multiple VLANs limits the size of broadcast 
941 
domains. In other words, it limits how far and to how many ports the broadcast 
942 
traffic is propagated. 
943 
 
944 
Another benefit of VLANs is improved network security. VLANs can be separated 
945 
on the switch, so that traffic from one VLAN is not communicated to another 
946 
VLAN. In addition, servers can be relocated into secured locations and connectivity 
947 
provided to only those workstations that need it. VLANs can improve scalability 
948 
and performance, and microsegmentation can dramatically improve some key 
949 
performance aspects in a LAN. Finally, VLANs can be used to distribute the traffic 
950 
load more efficiently throughout the LAN.

4.4.5 VLAN Components 
964 
Figure 1: VLAN Components 
965 
 
966 
 
967 
To truly understand VLANs, we need to understand some of the key components.  
968 
Switches play a role, but also routers, servers, and management stations play a role 
969 
in successfully deploying VLANs. 
970 
 
971 
Switches determine the VLAN membership and provide the basic connectivity of 
972 
the VLAN members. Trunking functionality is also needed. In other words, a way is 
973 
needed to exchange VLAN information between switches if the network VLANs 
974 
span multiple physical switches. Also, VLANs require multiprotocol routing 
975 
functionality. The routers provide this functionality. 
976 
 
977 
Remember that VLANs essentially create multiple network segments, so a method 
978 
is needed to route traffic between the VLANs, and that's what the router does. 
979 
Traffic flow in the network can be optimized by giving servers the ability to 
980 
discriminate traffic down to the individual VLAN level. Lastly, network 
981 
management functionality is needed in order to initially deploy and then manage 
982 
VLANs. Thus it's not just the switch that enables a successful VLAN deployment.   
983 
Practice 
984 
1. Switches provide the intelligence to do which of the following? 
985 
 
986 
A. They determine the VLAN membership. ** 
987 
B. They provide the multiprotocol routing between VLANs. 
988 
C. They discriminate traffic down to the individual VLAN level. 
989 
D. None of the above.

4.4.6 Establishing VLAN Membership 
993 
Figure 1: Establishing VLAN Membership 
994 
 
995 
 
996 
VLAN membership can be established in several ways, all involving trade-offs. In 
997 
port-driven VLAN membership, VLANs are determined by the port that a given 
998 
workstation plugs into. 
999 
 
1000 
For example, we may say on a 12-port switch that ports 1 through 6 are VLAN 1, 
1001 
and ports 7 through 12 are VLAN 2.   
1002 
 
1003 
VLAN membership can also be defined by MAC address. That is, the switch looks 
1004 
at a MAC address and then dynamically determines which VLAN a station belongs 
1005 
to based on its MAC address. This scenario offers a mechanism for dynamic VLAN 
1006 
membership, similar to network address VLAN membership. We can look at a 
1007 
workstation IP address, for example, or a user ID as the user logs into the network to 
1008 
determine which VLAN a station belongs to. Lastly, we can even look at the 
1009 
application type.

4.4.7 Membership by Port  
1022 
Figure 1: Membership by Port 
1023 
 
1024 
 
1025 
Providing the maximum forwarding performance, membership by port is the 
1026 
simplest mechanism of VLAN port membership. Users are simply assigned by the 
1027 
port that they plug into. No address lookups are required in the ASICs because the 
1028 
administrator manually defines the VLAN a particular port belongs to. Port-based 
1029 
VLAN member is also known as static VLANs. 
1030 
 
1031 
Administration is relatively easy, done either by command-line interface or by a 
1032 
graphical user interface (GUI). Port membership can also maximize the security 
1033 
between VLANs, and port-based VLANs can be created to ensure that the packets 
1034 
don't leak into other domains. Network administration is easily controlled across the 
1035 
entire network with port membership. 
1036

4.4.8 Membership by MAC Addresses 
1045 
Figure 1: Membership by MAC Addresses  
1046 
 
1047 
 
1048 
VLAN membership can also be determined by MAC address. This scenario requires 
1049 
filtering because we have to look at the traffic as it goes through the switch, a 
1050 
process that impacts performance. In addition, we have to look up in a table to 
1051 
determine which VLAN that traffic belongs to. 
1052 
 
1053 
Although this process offers flexibility, it also adds to the switch processing 
1054 
overhead. It offers flexibility to support mobile users and dynamically determine 
1055 
their VLAN membership based on the port that they plug into. The trade-offs lie in 
1056 
the areas of performance, scalability, administration, and so on. 
1057

4.4.9 Multiple VLANs per Port 
1067 
Figure 1: Multiple VLANs per Port [MAC, not Mac]  
1068 
 
1069 
 
1070 
Multiple VLANs can be defined on a given port. Although this solution might be 
1071 
required in situations where hubs are plugged into switch ports, it might defeat the 
1072 
original purpose of creating the VLAN. 
1073 
 
1074 
Notice that several VLANs are defined with individual VLAN members connected 
1075 
to the hubs, not to the switches. Now consider the broadcast message that will be 
1076 
sent by MAC station 1 on the left side of Figure [1]. 
1077 
 
1078 
As that broadcast message is propagated through the network, when it reaches the 
1079 
hub on the other side of the network, that hub will flood that broadcast traffic to all 
1080 
stations on that hub. Thus defining multiple VLANs on a single port negates the 
1081 
purpose of limiting broadcast traffic—and a key advantage of having VLANs is 
1082 
lost. Although this setup may be required in some instances for connectivity, 
1083 
remember that its use might actually defeat one of the key purposes of a VLAN.

4.4.10 Communicating Between VLANs 
1093 
Figure 1: Communicating Between VLANs  
1094 
 
1095 
 
1096 
Remember that VLANs essentially break up a switch into multiple, completely 
1097 
separate network segments. Now a router is needed to provide connectivity between 
1098 
those network segments. 
1099 
 
1100 
Connectivity can be achieved in two ways, logical connectivity or physical 
1101 
connectivity. Logical connectivity involves a single connection to the router, and 
1102 
that single connection can support multiple VLANs. This configuration is 
1103 
sometimes referred to as a “router on a stick,” because there is a single connection 
1104 
to the router but multiple logical connections inside that physical connection. In 
1105 
addition, the router performs the routing among the multiple VLANs. 
1106 
 
1107 
Another connectivity option is to have a separate physical connection for each 
1108 
VLAN. The obvious trade-off is that this configuration requires a separate physical 
1109 
port for each of the VLANs. Although this setup may provide better separation and 
1110 
better performance, the trade-off is the requirement for more resources, namely the 
1111 
individual interfaces on the router. With regard to VLAN support on the router, 
1112 
Cisco IOS® Software, for example, can support up to 255 VLANs on a given 
1113 
router. Thus there is flexibility in terms of routing between VLANs.

Summary 
1136 
This module included the following key points: 
1137 
 
1138 
I 
Thicknet and thinnet are two early LAN technologies widely installed. 
1139 
I 
When two or more workstation tried to send data at the same, the collision 
1140 
results. Collisions are by-products of an Ethernet network. 
1141 
I 
Communication in a network occurs in three ways. They are unicast, 
1142 
broadcast, and multicast transmission. 
1143 
I 
Microsegmentation enables dedicated access, eliminates collisions and 
1144 
increases capacity, and support multiple conversations at the same time. 
1145 
I 
Full-duplex transmission doubles the bandwidth between nodes. 
1146 
I 
Two common switching methods are cut-through and store and forward. 
1147 
I 
Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) is a loop-prevention protocol.  
1148 
I 
Layer 2 switches perform switching and filtering based on MAC addresses.  
1149 
I 
Layer 3 switches use IP addresses for their switching operations.  
1150 
I 
Layer 4 switching refers to Layer 3 hardware-based routing that accounts 
1151 
for Layer 4 control information. 
1152 
I 
VLANs provide broadcast/multicast containment and enhanced security by 
1153 
segmenting groups of users from each other on the network. In addition, 
1154 
VLANs also offer mobility of users within the campus environment.
